Lecturer traces world situation after World War I

By DAVID WILLIAMS

The first and second world
wars “are the two giant mountain
ranges that dominate the historical
landscape of the twentieth cen-
tury,” author John Lukacs said in
a speech sponsored by the Dean
Rusk Program Tuesday night be-
fore an overflow crowd in the 900
Room.

He added, “We still tive in the
shadow of these wars. Forty-two
years have passed since the end of
World War II, and the essential
elements of the world situation
have not changed very much.”

Lukacs noted that the decline
of European domination of world
affairs began in World War I and
was accelerated by the end of
World War II. He said the year
1945 signifies “the end of a Euro-
pean balance of power, which
lasted for four or five hundred
years when the main events, not
only of European but also of world
history, were marked by the re-
lationships, whether in peace or in
war, of the European powers
themselves.”

Wh --.

Lukacs\said that world history
during the period between the first
and second world wars is marked
by a “triangular relationship” be-
tween the forces of parliamentary
democracy, communism, and fas-
cism. “In this triangle, fascism
was the strongest force,” he said.
Fascism was “the new force of the
radical right, which first became
incamated in a number of Euro-
pean countries, including Italy,
but which had its most powerful
incarnation in Germany in 1933.”

Lukacs noted that only after
the end of World War II, when
fascism was virtually destroyed,
did .the dual rivalry between
capitalism and communism really
begin. When Adolph Hitler at-
tempted to conquer Europe during
World War II, “The Americans
and British combined could not
have defeated Germany. For this
they needed the Russians,”
Lukacs said.

“Our world situation today is a
result of this, he said. He ob-

victors of the war,” it was almost
inevitable that the Soviets would
claim the right to “swallow a fair
amount of Europe and try to incor-
porate it in one way or another in
its domains.”
Lukacs pointed out that the
communist regimes established in
eastern Europe after World War II
came to power “not because of the
popularity of communism,” but
because the “Russian armies oc-

cupied them and pretty much in- -

stalled their supporters in millions
and thousands.”

If Yugoslavia, Hungary, or
Czechoslavakia had been oc-
cupied by Anglo-American forces
at the end of the war, “their de-
velopment would have been simi-
lar to Austria and West Ger-
many,” he said. “This in itself in-
dicates that communism already
in 1945 was not such a dynamic
force as many people saw it at the
time.” In the world today, he said,
“Marxism has lost its intellectual
appeal. It is happening all over

served that “when the Soviet
Union arose as one of the great

Europe [that] Marxists are recog-
nizing that communism is not so

good after all.”

Lukacs also observed that des-
pite a 42 year period of rapid
changes and advancements in
technology and communication
since 1945, “nationalism, na-
tional character, nationality, na-
tional consciousness, and the na-
tional mind are still the predomin-
ant elements in the history of the
twentieth century.” He said that
although forces such as com-
munism theoretically should have
a worldwide orientation, “there is
na such thing in the world today as
international communism. There
are only different national com-
munisms and national socialisms.
There is Russian communism,
Chinese communism, Angolan
communism, Albanian com-
munism, Hungarian communism,
and they are becoming more and
more and more different.”

He added: “The entire world -

really shows the triumph of
socialism, because there is not one

- government in the world from

these welfare states “accentuate
their particularly national charac-
teristics. The American welfare
state is different from the French
welfare state. The Irish welfare
state is different from the British
welfare state.”

Lukacs emphasized that “we
have nationalism and socialism,
not international communism and
capitalism, which continue to be
the main elements in the political
configuration of the twentieth
century, even now, 40 years after
the second world war.” He said:
“Sometimes | think in the United
States itself perhaps this isthe way

. we may explain the odd structure

of our party system to the Euro-
peans. We have the Democrats,
who often are more socialistic
than nationalistic, and we have the
Republicans, who are often more
nationalistic than socialistic.”
Lukacs, a native of Hungary
and professor of history at
Chestnut Hill College in Philadel-
phia, has authored more than a

Tibet to Chile that to some extent
is not a welfare state.” He said

N. Carolina proved competitive for Davidsonians

By TOM MOORE

Even though no Davidson stu-
dents made it beyond the state
level this year in Rhodes Scholar-
ship competition, English instruc-
tor and Rhodes interviewer Hoke
Perkins is pleased with the candi-
dates. “Davidson sent out perhaps
its best group of candidates this

. year.. They were marvelous. That
no one got beyond the state level is
purely a function of the competi-
tion this year.

“Davidson is the sort of in-
stitution that will keep having
good luck with Rhodes Scholar-
ships. The quality of the intervie-
wees at the state level was very
good this year — probably the
best ever. We can only send four
people along to the district inter-
views, though.”

Perkins, a 1977 Rhodes schol-

ar, served for the first time this.

year on the state and district selec-
tion committees. Five Davidson
students were nominated this
year: Kathleen Micham ‘87,
Melissa Jones ’86, Gordon Wat-
kins °87, Dan Murrey °87 and
Mark Sandy.’87.

Watkins and Sandy were in-
terviewed in Virginia, Murrey in
Tennessee and Micham and Jones
in North Carolina. Under the rules

selected from each state then vie
for the scholarships at the regional
level. Four students are then
selected from each district (usu-
ally made up of six states: North
Carolina is in with Virginia, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida and
Tennessee). Another 40 Rhodes
scholars are picked from around
the world. The scholarship covers
two years’: education at Oxford
University in London.

“The Atlanta committee has a
reputation for being one of the
more rigorous,” Perkins said.
“People who go to Harvard and
other New England universities
who are from North Carolina tend
to come back here to compete,
which makes North Carolina’s
competition very rigorous.

“North Carolina has a high
concentration of academics.
People who live in Idaho should
go back home to compete. Com-
ing back to North Carolina doesn’t
help you much.

“Only. one out of the four this
year was from a college from out-
side of the area (Columbia Uni-
versity),” Perkins said. “The
others were from Duke, Wake
Forest, and the University of Ten-
nessee/Chattanooga. I know that

of the competition, students can
choose to compete in either their
home state or the state in which
they go to school. The two

in—Hlinois— for—example, — there
were two awarded and both’ stu-
dents went to Yale. The colleges
and universities in this area hold

their own.”

Perkins found the interview .

process both interesting and
stressful. “I slept better when I
went through them as a participant
than when I was on the selection
committee. It was nerve-racking
for us. ‘

“T got a file of about 32 appli-
cations ten days before the state
interviews. We had a round-robin
of votes to see who we were going
to interview.

“T thought that the state inter-
views were more pleasant (than
the district interviews); they’re
designed to bring out the best in
the candidates. At the cocktail
party the night before, they can
show you their best.

“The next day, all day, we
hold the interviews. They last 20
to 25 minutes. One of the
hallmarks of the Rhodes inter-
views is that you find out right
away whether you got it or not.
We ask them to come back two to
three hours later while the deci-
sion is being made. We keep them
together so that! they can get to
know each other — and be ner-
vous together,” he said.

“The district interviews were
\much more rigorous. The format

more nervous,” because it is the

the opportunity to tell what they
know about their area, and then
they're subjected to a barrage of
questions on any topic. We can
only choose four of the 12 candi-
dates.”

“It’s an exhilarating experi-
ence; it’s good to get to know each
other, but it can also be disap-
pointing as well. I was. lucky
enough to get my name called, but
not everyone was. I think that
knowing right away is a strength,”
though others may feel it is too
much pressure and a disadvan-
tage, he said.

Perkins found several aspects
of the decision process encourag-
ing. “In the last twenty years,
there has been a marked decrease
ingthose who wanted to teach. It
was heartening this year to see an
interest in teaching.

“I think it’s because a lot of
universities are now hiring profes-
sors who got their doctorates in
the "60s and °70s, and they’re in-
spiring students with the ethic of
the °60s and 70s, directing them.
toward lives not driven by the
search for money. It’s good to see:
research being done in humanities
at Oxford.”

Perkins also found the compe-

norm this year was probably over
a 3.9. It’s very daunting; you have
to choose, and everyone there °
could easily be a Rhodes Schol-
ar.”

Perkins fe}t honored to be
selected for the district inter-
views. “Interviewers are chosen
by the American secretary; they
run the whole show. They like to
have a mixture of ages, and I think
I was supposed to bring new blood
into the committee, because I was
the youngest one there.

“I was very surprised to be
chosen to go to the district inter-
views. Usually, it is the secretary
of each state that goes, but North
Carolina rotates every year. Each
of the other members on the state
committee had already served, so
it was my turn, even though it was
my first year as a state intervie-
wer. These (on the district com-”
mittee) are older, very distin-
guished looking men — | thought
it might be hard to break. into (the
group), but they were actually
very friendly.”

a student at the University of
Alabama in 1977. He received his
