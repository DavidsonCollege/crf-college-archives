chapter or any member there-
of, to secure dates with a
tushee for that chapter or
otherwise to influence him to
it.”

All rushing is limited to the
town of Davidson and no fra-
ternity man can during the rush
period pay a rushee’s way to

the show, buy him refresh-
ments of in any way provide
set-ups.

The penalty for so-called

“dirty rushing” is a $50.00
fine for the fraternity involved.
Any rushee violating the regu-
lations regarding Rushing will
render himself ineligible to
join or be pledged by any fra-
ternity at Davidson College un-

<t

Phil Lewis, Judge of the Court of Control, has ex-
pressed his hopes for a successful program.
