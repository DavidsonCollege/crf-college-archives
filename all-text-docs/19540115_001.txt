RALPH CLONTZ

Ralph C. Clontz, Jr., Davidson
class of '47, testified before the
Subversive Activities Control
Board in Washington last Tuesday
that for the past four years he
had been an undercover member
of the Communist Party as a
secret agent for the FBI.

Clontz, who is now a lawyer liv-
ing in Charlotte, N.C., was a mem-
ber of the Glee Club, Band, Phi
Literary Society, Debating Team,
International Relations Club and
wrestling and track squads while
a student here. He graduated with
a B. S, degree in psychology.

His father, Ralph C. Clontz, Sr.,
is a retired Presbyterian minister
who has been residing here in
the Davidson community since his
retirement last August. Neither he
nor Clontz’s mother had any knowl-
edge that their son was working in
an undercover role with the FBI
until their story broke last week.
Mrs. Ralph Clontz, Jr., refused to
comment when questioned by a
Charlotte Observer reporter until
she heard from her husband.

Frank Van der Linden, Observer
Washington correspondent, gave
the following account of Clonte’s
testimony:

Clontz, 31, made his revelation
at a hearing before the Subversive
Activities Control Board. The
board is to decide whether or not
the “Jefferson School of Social
Science” in New York should be
officially branded a Communist
front under the Internal Security
Act of 1950.

Clontz said he attended the
school on a scholarship obtained

HENRY BROCKMANN
Henry Brockmann, a junior
from High Point, N.C., has been
chosen to edit the Wildcat Hand
beek for the 1964-55 school term.
The Handbook is published an-
nually by the YMCA and distrib-
uted to all members of the stu-
dent body and faculty.

This year the editor has bee
appointed earlier in the year than
has been the custom in the past in
order to give him more time in
which to work.

Brockmann has been active in
publications work with the David
senien since his freshman year,
serving as a reporter until this
year when he became front-page

editor.

He is a member of Sigma Phi
Epsilon social fraternity, the vice-
president of the Eumanean Lit-
erary Society, and active in YMCA
work.

A Ristory major, Brockmann is
taking part in the History Honors
program.

as the chairman of the Com-
munist Party for the district of
North Carolina and South Caro-
lina. The lawyer said he used his
first two names, “Ralph Clayton,”
as an alias, and later only a num-
ber, when he attended the school.
Post Card

Clontz said he wrote a post card
to Scales in 1948 and received a
box full of Communist literature.
After months of study and ques-
tioning, Clontz was considered “a
dedicated Marxist” by Scales and
admitted to the Communist Party
in early 1950, the witness said.

In April, 1950, Clontz said, he
contacted the FBI, offering to
enter into full-time service as an
undercover agent inside the Com-
munist Party. He was then a stu-
dent at the Law School of Duke
University, Durham, N. C., and
division sales manager for the
Carolina Motor Club of Charlotte.

He received his law degree in
the summer of 1950, was admitted
to the N. C. Bar that September,
and opened his office in the law
building at Charlotte.

Clontz said he enrolled in the
Jefferson School of Social Science
in August, 1950, for a two-week
course that included studies of
Marxism and pamphlets by Lenin
and Stalin, which he identified as
exhibits for evidence. One teach-
er said Negro women were doubly
oppressed, he said, first as women,
and secondly as Negroes. Another
pamphlet was entitled “The Path

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N.C.,

SENIOR PLACEMENT|GOALS FOR 1954
TO BEGIN AT ONCE |SIGHTED BY GROUP

Seniors wishing to get jobs
through the placement buregu are
asked to sign up immediately as
companies wishing applicants will
start interviewing after exams.

A qualification record must be
filled out by the seniors. This
record can be gotten in the place-
ment bureau, located in the Alum-
ni Office on the first floor of
Chambers.

Men who are either in ROTC or
have other military obligations
are urged to come in for inter-
views, since most of these com-
panies are interested in getting
men, even though they may have
to serve two years in the armed
forces before beginning work.

Thirty-five or forty companies
will be on the campus for inter-
views this spring, including such
national names as Deering Milli-
ken Textile, Organization, Burling-
ton Mills, Cargaill Corporated, Gen-
eral Electric, Southern Béll, Wa-
chovia Bank, Colgate-Palmolive-
Peet, Proctor and Gamble, Chase
National Bank, and Union Carbide.

Mr. Dillon believes this to be
the greatest opportunity the men
here will ever have for obtaining
a future position with national
firms. Men will be here from such
fields as insurance, textiles, bank..
ing, office management, advertis-
ing, personnel, and industrial rela-
tions.

Last year salaries offered by
these visiting firms ranged from
$275 to $410. Some 1-A classified
students (military classification)
and several ROTC students were
accepted by firms with the under-
standing that they would serve
with the armed forces before re-
porting for work.

WHITE RELEASED IN
DC ATHLETIC UPROA

By WATT McCAIN

Davidson's troubled athletic sit-
uation took on a new complexion
recently with the college admin-
istration’s decision to abolish the
office of athletic publicity direc-
tor. .
Labeled as a purely economic
measure the move was not a com-
plete surprise, having been under
consideration for a number of
months and rumored as far back
as last winter. Authorities cite the
deficit drawn by athletics in the
college budget and the actual
needlessness of a separate pub-
licity department for sports as the
factors calling for a change..

Closely following:.a sudden an-
nouncement of the decision to
drop several “money” games with
larger schools in the 1954 foot-
ball schedule, the removal gave all
appearances of a trend toward de-
emphasis of intercollegiate ath-
letics by Davidson. Elgin White,
director of the office since 1650,
in an interview was quick to
acknowledge his belief that this
definitely figured in the decision,
adding that a poor football season
probably laid impetus to it.

Other sources insist that the
action was purely from an economy
standpoint. The athletic publicity
officé has not been financed by
the athletic fund, but has been
included in the general college
budget. Treasurer Grier Martin
said that in an effort to balance
spending on the athletic program
a cut was advisable somewhere.
That cut was left to the adminis

~ftration. He added that Davidson

should not attempt to compete in
sports publicity with schools that
spend more on their whole inter-
collegiate athletic programs.
Obviously, this move will cut a
great deal of the national publicity
Davidson receives, such as readers’
interest article printed in many
leading papers several weeks ago.
Plans are for the duties of sports
publicity to be turned over to the
college public relations depart-
ment; it is likely that a number
of students will carry on the job
under direction of this office, al-
though publicity man John Dil-
lon implied that nothing had yet
been definitely decided.
Newspaper sports writers have
not failed to show their disappoint-
ment over the action. An article
during vacation in a
Charlotte daily blasted the move
and termed it typical Davidson
policy toward athletics.
Asked if the coaches felt it
would hurt, Athletic Director Paul

«

Scott said, “Of course, we would
prefer a full-time man, but we'll
just have to see how it’s handled
otherwise.” He also pointed out
that no other schools the size of
Davidson provided for a separate
athletic publicity office.

The office of athletic publicity
director was installed in 1947 with
Joe Thigpen as director. Elgin
While succeeded Thigpen in
August, 1950, and has done an
excellent job in this capacity as
well as doubling as coach of the
college golf team. He will remain
on the campus until June. Presi-
dent Cunningham and Director
Paul Scott both praised Mr. White
for the outstanding work he has
done for the college.

By JOHN HIERS

Possible goals for the year were
discussed by the members of the
Student-Faculty Conference Com-
mittee at a meeting of that group
last Friday night.

An important goal concerns the
present parking situation on the
campus. The committee is anxious
to work through the proper chan-
nels to alleviate the existing con-
dition.

Another goal under discussion is
the development of better tech-
niques for encouraging student-
faculty conferences. This could be
accomplished by more convenient
office hours on the part of the pro-
fessors and by more initiative on
the part of the students to see
the faculty.

The committee would like to see
some arrangement made for in-
forming students of faculty trips
and the opportunities for rides
when faculty members are going
to their region.

Improved procedures and_in-
creased opportunities for students
to make their views known to the
faculty as a whole were also dis-
cussed as possible goals of the
committee for this year.

It should be understood that the
Student-Faculty Conference Com-
mittee does its work through
other appropriate channels, and
that no projects are carried on by
the committee as such.

This group will welcome ideas,
suggestions, and comments from
any member of the student body,
particularly on the goals mentioned
in this article. Any student having
something to contribute is urged
to contact some member of the
committee.

Dr. Jay H. Ostwalt serves as
chairman of the committee, and
the other faculty members are
Professors Ernest Beaty and
Donald Plott. Student members are
Lyman Kiser, president of the
student body; Charlie Johnson,
president of the senior class; Floyd
Feeney, president of the junior
class; Jim Daughdrill, president of
the sophomore class; and Max De-
Vane, freshman adviser. Editor
Moody Smith of the Davidsonian
has been invited to sit in on the
meetings this year as the paper’s
representative.

It was decided to have the group
meet bi-weekly, starting after
exams. At the next meeting on
Friday night, February Sth, the
public relations of the college will
be discussed.

It was brought to the attention
of the committee that the college
laundry is now open until five
o'clock in the afternoon, a fact
which many students do not
realize.

With Short Funds .

The 1953-54 YMCA Gift Fund,
which was voted to be used as aid-
ing the Negroes of Davidson by
building them a community hut
complete with television set and
other recreation facilities, fell
short of its goal by a $1200 mar-
gin. Which element of the project
that would be most affected by
the lack of financial backing was
not known.

The original plan called for a
hut equipped with the necessary
facilities, and for a paid director.

Marterie, who popularized the
instrumental “Caravan,” and the
hit ballad “Pretend,” will hold
forth on the Johnston Gym band-
stand from nine until one for the
formal dance Friday night.

Following an afternoon concert
on Saturday, Marterie will play
from eight until twelve that night.

Only formed in 1951, Marterie’s
band has enjoyed such great suc-
cess that it is now placed among
America’s top dance bands.

An instrumental star on his
own, Marterie has been in the past
holder of the key “lead” trumpet
chairs with such outstanding band
leaders as Paul Whiteman, Percy
Faith, Frank Black, Roy Shields,
and John Scott Trotter.

Marterie’s association with Mer-
cury records, begun in 1949, has
resulted in a steady growth in the
popularity of his recordings. The
list of more than forty numbers
includes established favorites such
as “Once in a While,” “Persian
Market,” and “Street Scene.”

Four Davidson Men
Afiend Union Meet

Use of electric-eye devices and
TBM counting and filing machines
in order to poll student use of
Union facilities was suggested at
a recent conference of representa-
tives of college unions held in
Greensboro at Woman’s College.

University of Florida in Gains-
ville, Fla., proposed the use of
the devices mentioned above as a
method that they had used in find-
ing what facilities of their college
unions were most used. They dis-
covered that the most-used facili-
ty were the rest rooms.

This conference of union direc-
tors and college representatives
began on Thursday, January 7, and
lasted through lunch on Saturday,
January 9. The conference was at-
tended by C. Shaw Smith, director
of the Davidson union, and four
students, including Bill Hood,
Buddy Beehler, Austin Strand,
and Joe Sandifer.

Thursday's activities centered
around registration and a talent
show put on by the Woman's Col-
lege, UNC and NC State delegates.
Friday, the delegates were wel-
comed by Dr. E. K. Graham, chan-
cellor of Woman’s College, and
David Phillips, chairman of the
conference. Bill Rion, from the
University of Florida, gave an ad-
dress on “The Purpose of the
Union.”

The rest of Friday was spent in
conference groups, with the dele-
gates discussing such topics as
committee structure, house rules,
and use of facilities, maintaining
interest, budget allocation of funds,
programming and evaluation of
committee members. Bill Hood led
the discussion on maintaining in-
terest.

Saturday’s activities centered
around discussing how to improve
publicity and how to coordinate
the union with other campus activ-
ities.

At a general meeting held just
before the conference was ad-
