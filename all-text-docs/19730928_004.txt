A Great Disappointment

We were greatly disturbed by
College President Samuel R. Spencer’s
address ‘‘The Year In Prospect” at
last Friday’s Convocation ceremony.
In very few ways was it the kind of
‘State of the College’ speech that we
were led to suspect it would be.

In the first place, Spencer seemed to
focus on the athletic problems of the
college, rather than giving a broader,
more fat-reaching assessment of the
college over the past year, and what he
feels we can expect in the years to
come.

As one administration source put it,
dealing primarily with the realm of
athletics - admittedly an important
problem - would have been more ac-
ceptable if only the President had in-
dicated from the start that it would be
the focal point of his address. and that
in dealing with that, he did not mean to
slight other areas of concern.

However, this was not the case. He
made no effort to stress this point.

More importantly, Spencer seemed
to us to slide over many of the issues
without telling us what he thought
about them or anticipated happening.
We the college, look to him for this kind
of thinking. It is of considerable im-
portance to us what his opinions on cer-

tain issues are. ;
On several key issues, Spencer

stated no personal opinions. He told us
that the curriculum needed to be refor-
med to meet the needs of the women
students. However, he gave no in-
dication in what areas he thought this
kind of change should occur.

On Christian Committment, he said
‘‘The important task before us is to
determine how this committment
should be defined and how it can be
given visible and effective witness.”’
What remained unanswered was,
‘‘How does he feel that the Christian

Committment should be expressed?’’

In the area of financial stability, the
President made the very satisfying an-
nouncement that the college had
finished in the black by $300,000 last
year, but gave no detailed ex-
planantion why.

At the conclusion of the speech, he
apologized for not touching on the area
of the most significant concern to a
large portion of the community: that of
the academic program, past and
future. We find it hard to pass over so
lightly something this important.

After all, we are at Davidson
primarily to get an education. It is
vitally important to us to know both
what he feels have been the important
academic improvements of the past
year, and what we can expect in the
next year.

On a positive note, we cannot
overlook the good developments in
athletics and finance. There was much
welcome news in these two areas,
especially with the appointment of
what we fully expect to be an excellent
Athletic Director, Mr. Thomas Cart-
mill, and with the revamping of the
football scholarship program and

Wildcat Athletic Club funding.

Unfortunately, this is not enough for
most people here. We want, and we
strongly feel we have the right,
to know what the President’s feelings

are on the vital issues of the college.

This does not mean to imply that we
feel Dr. Spencer is not doing the job, or
does not have opinions. Quite the con-
trary, we feel he does have strong, well
thought-out viewpoints, and that he has
done a good job.

All we ask is that he present us with
his opinions, especially when we have
been led to expect that he will do so.
This is not an unreasonable request.

The New Union

We are glad to see that the college is
now beginning to make plans to
remove the Union from its present
inadequate location to the far more
suitable one in the Grey Library.

In terms of long-range planning, we
think it essential that the college begin
to look for the money now to build a
new Union, for such a facility is
desperately needed to bring the college

closer together as a community.

Above all else, this college needs a
new Union - a building which was
created to be a Union and nothing else.

The longer we delay, the more
remote will be the possibility of con-
structing such a building.

The longer the college community
becomes acclimated to the Union in the
Grey Library, the more difficult
another transition will be.

A Need To Give

During this week of solicitation for
the YM/YWCA fund drive, students are
encouraged to examine their relation-
ship to the Davidson community ex-
tending beyond the college campus.

The YM/YWCA is presently sur-
veying the needs of the Davidson com-
munity, a community in which studen-
ts must play integral parts. And as
great as the needs of every segment of
the community are, perhaps the
greatest need lies in students being
willing to give of themselves.

In a school which challenges its
students to Christian committment,
students must be presented with the
opportunities, such as those offered by
the Y, to curtail the drastic limitations
of the expresssion of that com-
mittment.

Responding to the YM/YWCA
solicitations with committments of
self-giving will allow Davidson
students to outgrow the long black
robes of an isolated institution to
recognize the needs of the entire com-
munity.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Huller Denounces
Shoddy Journalism

To the Editor:

The recent editorial *‘In-
sanity” is a truly shoddy piece
of journalism. Facts are
misstated, inferences are mis-
used. Space limitations do not
permit an adequate/thorough
critique of the editorial
(especially concerning deter-
rence theory and strategic
weapons systems), but some
comments are in order.

The Defense Department did
not ‘‘by far and away (get) the
lion’s share of the budget’ in
1972. Since 1971 the defense has
been less than 36.7 percent of
total budget outlays. In the 1974
budget, $81.1 billion is proposed
for national defense (Defense
Department's share is only $78.7
billion) and $125.5 billion for
human resources. The former is
30.2 percent of the total budget:
the latter is 46.7 percent. I trust
the editorial writer recognizes
which figure is larger.

Contrary to the hopes/ex-
pectations of some, $81.1 billion
is not being proposed to build
bigger and better instruments
of mass destruction and terror.
Since 1972 at least 53 percent of
total defense costs has been
manpower costs. The figure for
fiscal year 1974 is 56 percent.
Most of these costs go for active
military manpower; providing

for an all-volunteer army,
among other things, will not be
cheap. It does not follow nor is it
true that the other 47 percent of
the defense budget goes for
development of weapons
systems.

There were no limitations in
the SALT accords on MIRV’s,
the number of warheads per
missile. We could sign
agreements giving the Russians
nuclear superiority in nearly
every field only because we
have superior manned strategic
bombing forces (now in-
creasingly vulnerable and
inadequate) and an advanced
MIRV technology.

The Russians have insisted on
developing offensive weapons
systems not barred by the
agreements; they may soon
perfect a competent MIRV
system. Before we understand
the facts and concepts, should
we eliminate/emasculate
weapons systems which will in-
sure deterrence, security, and
peace?

Defense Elliot L. Richardson's

Barbara Londin of New York
City will have a one woman
exhibition at the Garden
Gallery of the Mint Museum,
Sept. 30 through Oct. 28.
Working primarily in pastels,
the artist uses dreamlike
images which evoke childhood
images, revealing a kinship of
feeling with Redon and Ensor.

“Reconstruction Period,”
Juan Logan's exhibit of 10 steel
sculptures will appear on the
lawn in front of the Cunningham
Fine Arts Center, beginning
Sept. 30. The works represent a
return to nonfigurative art con-
cerned with formal
organization of plane ex-
pression of volume in terms of
modern industrial materials, in
this case galvanized steel.

Logan, who in his work strips
ideas and forms to their most
simplistic elements, speaks of
himself as ‘‘a man, an
American man, and American
artist, and a Black Aerican
man-artist,” in that order. His
work does not follow the pattern
of didactic black art with its
tone of social protest, nor does
it reflect the nostalgia of neo-
Africanism. It is part of the
mainstream of American art.
