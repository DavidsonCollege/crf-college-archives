By Jessica MERING

Davidson College’s Statement of Purpose
declares the College’s commitment to “assist
students in developing human instincts and disci-
plined and creative minds for lives of leadership
and service.” In keeping with this philosophy, the
College offers selected students the opportunity
to replace work-study with paid service projects.
The Bonner Scholars program gives eighty ser-
vice-oriented students the chance to contribute to
their community while earning money for their
Davidson education.

Davidson is one of twenty-two colleges and
universities, most of them on the east coast, that
supports a Bonner Scholars program. Others in-

Davidson students for service projects. With the

Scholars together as a group.

In addition to completing a ten-hour-per-

week service minimum, the students attend weekly
meetings with the other Scholars in their class.
Recently, all eighty Bonner Scholars attended a
daylong retreat at Davidson United Methodist
Church. They planned activities for this year, dis-
cussed service opportunities, and participated in
team-building exercises. The retreat helped to ce-
ment relationships among the Scholars.

Bonner Scholars have chosen to take part in.
the program because they recognize the good that
service provides both to themselves and to those
that they serve.

Stephanie Connolly ’03 commented on her
reasons for joining the program. “I’ve always
loved service and it’s a huge part of my life. The
program helps center me and remind me of how
important it is to help others,” she said.

lege, Wofford Col-

sity of Richmond.
The program was
created by a South-
ern couple who
grew up in a poor,
coal mining com-
munity and recog-
nized both the value
of education as well
as it’s high financial
price tag. Their be-
lief that education is
crucial to success in
life led them to cre-
ate a scholarship
program which al-
lowed students to
earn money while
contributing to their
community.

Ruth Pittard,
Assistant Dean of
Community Ser-
vice, describes it as
a program which
“creates opportuni-
ties for students to
discover who they
are through serving
others.” Although
the program pro-
vides students with
a stipend in return
for their service,
Pittard notes that the
program “can offer
something more
than just money; the
money is inciden-
tal.” Because of the
stipend, Bonner
Scholars do not have
to sacrifice commu-
nity service in order
to have a part-time
job. — Pittard says
that this freedom al-
lows “students to
make
based on more than
just money.” She
stresses how well
the program fits in
with Davidson’s
philosphy and its
dedication to ser-
vice.

Becoming a
Bonner scholar is a
competitive pro-
cess. Space in the
program is limited,
the college cannot
accept all that ap-
ply; the scholarships
are awarded to about
half of the students
who apply for them.
Twenty first-year
Students are ac-
cepted into the pro-
gram each year and
they remain in it for
their four years at
Davidson.
