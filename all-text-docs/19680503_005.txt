Wildcat Baseballers

Win Twice... Honest!

The: Davidson baseball
team, a team which had al-
most forgotten what it was
‘like to win, finally rememi-

bered this week, .as they
picked upitwo wins in three
outings.

Not bad for a team which
had‘won only ope in 18 prior
to that.

‘We were a different team
this week,’’ said tedm cap
tain Jack Smith, as he sum-
med up the team’s reaction
to wins over High Point and
Furnian.

The ‘Cat nine apparently
put together all the elements
of winning baseball at last,
as pitching and hitting began
“to coordinate into a solid at-

tack.

The ‘Cats split a double
header with Furman Tues-
day. In spite of a Solid at
tack in the first game. they
fell 7-5, and then rode the
two hit pitching of Johnny
Riggs to a 6.0 win in.the sec-
ond. ‘

It was the bats of Gordon
Slade and Frank Murphy
which provided. the hitting
punch for Davidson.

Slade pounded out a single,
a double, two triples and a
home run in eight trips to
the plate. while Murphy pick-
ed up five hits, going three
for three in the second game.

Coach Tom Stevens com.

Guilford’s Dixon
New Grid Coach

After working for several
weeks shorthanded, the Da-
vidson football coaching ‘staff
has found a replacement for
assistant coach Warner Al-
ford, who resigned last month
to assume a position at Geor-
gia Tech.

Head coach Homer Smith
announced this week the ad-
dition of Thurston (Buddy)
Dixon to the coaching staff.

Dixon, a 1964 graduate of
Guilford College, will take
over the duties of defensive
backfield coach. .

Voted most valuable play-
er at Guilford during his sen-
ior year, Dixon led the Caro-
linas Conference in pass re-
ceiving. A two-way perform-
er, he also starred on defense
as a safety.

“We think we've been lucky
to latch onto another fine
coach,’ Smith said of Dixon,
who spent the past season as
a graduate assistant football
coach at Guilford. while tak-
ing graduate courses at UNC.

Before assuming his coach-

mented that it was Murphy's
“best day ever in a Wildcat
uniform.” He also pointed to
Slade’s seven RBI's which
almost doubled his previous
total of eight.

In the first, gam.e ‘David
King pitched one-hit ball for
six innings in relief of starter
Clark Nickerson.

Nickerson was extremely
wild at the outset, as he
walked five, hit a batter and
gave up two hits en route to
a-seven run Furman barrage
in the first two innings.

“I'm not sure what hap
pened ‘to Nickerson.”’ said
Stevens. “It had never hap
pened to him before. Perhaps
he was pressing too hard.”

The change in the team’s
appearance began before the
Furman gamés, however. It
began against High Point
last weekend.

It came behind the strong
pitching of freshman Wade
Shepherd. who went the full
nine innings to chalk up a
four-hit 4-2 win.

“We had been talking
about. winning for. a Jong
time,"’ said one player after
the game. ‘We finally got
around to doing it."

Stevens said after the game
that the team had looked ‘‘a
whole lot better.”

“We finally started playing
ball effectively.“. he said.
‘and our defense finally be.
gan to click. That makes a
great difference."

Tomorrow afternoon, the

Wildcats meet East Caro

lina in their last home game
of the season.

Stevens said that he plan.
ned to start Shepherd against
the Pirates and added that
he was looking forward to
the garhe in the hopes for an
upset win.

The ‘Cats take to the road
next week for their final
games of the season against
Furman and The Citadel.

SUBSIDIZED TEAMS STRONG
"Cats Face Tough Tournaments

By BOB DUNHAM
Sports Editor
Whether the sport be track.
golf or tennis, next week is
the week for tournaments,
and from ‘all that. has been
said it appears that David
son should do well in all of

them.

» With the three conference
tournaments rapidly ap
proaching. each coach took
time this week to analyze
his team's possibilities, and
everyone seemed quite opti-
mistic.

Track Coach Heath Whit-
tle. for instance, is sending
¥4 men to the conference
meet next weekend and ex.
pects strong performances
from each one.

Leading the way to Ft.
Eustis, Va., and the meet
which will be held by the
U.S. Army, will be sprinters
Rick Lyon and Greg Cox.

Whittle said this week that
he feels Lyon has a good
chance of taking the 100 and
220 yard dashes, and pointed
to his times for evidence. Ly
on has run a 9.7 in the hun-
dred with a 21.6 in the 220,
each time only one-tenth of

a second behind’ the top con-
ference time this year.

Cox will compete in the
broad jump, 120 high hurdles,

.440 yard relay and possibly

the mile relay. Whittle looks
for his best effort in the
broad. jump.

Another race in which the
Wildcats figure to place is
the 440 yard relay. The prob-
lem which might eliminate
the relay team is the injured
leg of sprinter Whit Mor.
row. Whittle said that if Mor-
row can run, the teatn should
do quite well.

The orily other Davidson
runner is picked to finish
well is John Puckett. who
should turn in a .top per

-formance in the 880.

The remainder of the team
which will go to Ft. Eustis
includes Tom Rogers. Keith
Everett. George Rogister.
Brad Danielson, James Puck.

almost a sure bet to finish
better than last year. when
the. team failed to score a
single point.

The Dunes Country. Club in
Myrtie Beach will.be the site

In this tournament, David

ably find the going rough in

Although the Wildcats will
be the team to beat, they
will encounter several schools
in the tourney that; began

two years ago. The result
will be several tough teams.

Strong challenges are ex.
pected from Furman and The

Delts Ride Thompson, Hunt
To Machi Win, IMAC Title

By GARY SIGMON
Sports Writer

Phi Delta Theta won it all
yesterday afternoon.

In the battle of the giants,
the. Phi Delts edged by.Sig-
ma Chi, 3-2, behind the three-
hit pitching of Kit . Thomp-
son.

Both teams looked impres-
sive in what was probably
the best game of the IMAC
softball season. ;

Ron Hunt provided the big
stick for the Delts, as his
fourth inning two-run homer
brought across the winning
Tuns.

Fox Demoisey picked up
the only solid Machi hit off
the windmilling Thompson.

But the play of the game
went to.Sigma Chi's Jerry
Kroll. In the bottom of the
first inning, Kroll took a fly
ball in straightaway center
field and picked off the Delts’
Jim May, who had tagged
up, with a perfect throw to
the plate.

The Machis retained sole
possession of second place,
however, as Kappa Alpha up-
set the Phi Gamms. For the
Phi Gamms it was only the
third loss of the season, as
they came out on the short
end of a 3-1” score.

Earlier in the week, the

Phi Delts sustained their
only loss of the season at the
hands of the Phi Gamms, as
the absence of Thompson
was a great factor. The final
score was 19.14 in the long
slugfest.

The Deilts jumped back in-
to the winning quickly by
trouncing the SAE's 13-5.
Hunt. Dave Fearnbach, and
Dave Moser led the Delt at-
tack.

Sigma Chi demolished the
Sig Eps 18-1. Bob Lanier
handcuffed the Sig Ep bat-
ters, while the hitting of De-
moisey and Lanier led the
Machi offense.

The Machis extended their
record to 10-1 as they trounc-
ed the KA's 10.3. Edgar Ex-
um led the Machi hitters.

The SAE’s beat the Pikas
17.7. Rusty Lacy was the
winning pitcher and led his
team at the plate also. Steve
Butler aided the SAE cause
with a homerun.

With a well-rounded attack
the Gamms defeated the Pi
Kapps 13.7. Bob Apgar pitch.
ed a good game and the en-
tire Gamm team hit the ball
well.

The Pi Kapps came out on
top. however, in their game
with the KA’s. Sam McNeely

pitched for the Pi Kapps and
Bill Bowman collected three
hits.

The Sigma Nus walloped
the Kappa Sigs 15-3. Bill Bar-
nett played excellent -defense
as Dave White and Steve
Hayes each got three hits.
Tommy Phillips was the win-
ning pitcher.

TWO HANDS FOR BEGINNERS
KA’s Slade watches Chalk handle pop fly.

With only a few make-up
games left to be played, the
Delts have finished on top of
the standings with an 11-1
record. Sigma Chi is second
with a 10.2 season mark.

The Gams and the Nus tied
for third with 9-3 records,
and the Sig Eps finished fifth
with a 7-5 mark.;

Smith said he was. ¢on
cerned at the outset of spring
practice about the loss of As
sistant Coach Warner Alford
to Georgia Tech and the loss
of returning starters Lindsey
Bishop and Hank Strickland
to injuries and graduate
school. ‘

Practice has gone smooth
ly, however, and Smith now
feels that: his 1968 edition

will be stronger than fast °

year’s team.

According to Smith,’ the
Wildcats won't have as much
drop off next year as many
fans expect due to the loss of
all - conference quarterback
Jimmy Poole. The reason for
this is Gordon Slade. who
appears ready to Jead the
Wildcat offensive in the man.
ner it has become accustom.
ed during the Poole era.

Smith said that Davidson
can't afford to “have sopho-
mores playing like sopho-
mores next year,’ With this
in mind he has installed a
number of sophomores to key
Positions and is trying to
give them as much playing
experience as possible.

Sophomores John Harper.
Leonard Baugham, Mike Mi.
kolayunas and Rusty Law-
rence have looked good on
offense while Nick Dumich,
Chris Giles, and Brian Pet-
erson have impressed the
coaches on defense.

Despite an extremely tough
schedule, Davidson's 1968
squad should, barring injur-
ies, be much improved over
last year's squad.
