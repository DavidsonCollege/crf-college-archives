FRIDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1958

Bavidsonian —

By JIM HAMILTON

Hark ye to the reading of the lesson from the book
of Pigskin Proverbs.

“Blessed are ‘the meek, for they shall win football
games.”

This is a story in contrast.

Between halves of the P.C. game | was groping
along in the subterranean regions of the Presby-
terian gym. My wanderings led to a door slightly
ajar, on the other side of which rested the P.C. ball-
team, at that time enjoying a six point lead.

Through the crack I heard a belligerent, demanding
voice declaring in a harsh tone, “You guys can win this
game tonight. Some of you are hitting, some are not.
You gotta get in there and knock their b.... s off.”

Out of curiosity, | asked one of our players what
Coach Dole said during the halftime. He told me and
the scene was easy to picture.

Dole stood up and im his mild way and in his soft
voice that seems to transmit his own personal feeling
to those to whom he is talking, said, “To win this ball
game you fellows have to take the kickoff and drive for
a touchdown the first time.”

The kick off and three plays later Davidson had
a touchdown—and a ball game.

Again from the book of Proverhs, ‘A soft answer
turneth out football teams that scoreth touchdowns—
Selah.” ‘

Short Shots

The grapevine has it that there will be an innova-
tion in the Dole machine come tomorrow afternoon. And
what is it—no huddle. The coach figures it will save
time and energy and probably add spirit to the offense.
We wonder what will come next.

Scoop of the week—Davidson and Furman will
meet November 1 in the first Carrousel Bowl. The
event will be one of the highlights in the week long
Carrousel pageant, that includes a hockey game, a
pro basketball game, and Kim Novac. The plan is

to have 10,000 people at the game and turn a rather
stale series into a prominent affair.

Coach Parker wishes to see all boys interested in
going out for the wrestling team in the wrestling room
in the gym Monday at four o'clock.

cats Drop P.C.
Long Jaunt

By BILL HELLIER

Breathing a little easier after a 7-6 defeat of strong Presbyterian College, the
Davidson Wildcats meet Carson-Newman College tomorrow afternoon on Richard-
sen Field for their first game of the season in the home stadium.

dog, the Wildcats were deter-
mined to make the forecasters
eat their words, and they did
just that in a game that was
closer than the 7-6 score indi-
cated.

A P.C. team that was big,
fast, powerful, and spirited
literally raced down the
field time and again, only
to be halted short of the
goal. Fumbles and holding
penalties proved costly to
the eager Blue Hose, espe-

cially when they were deep

in Davidson territory. The

alert ‘Cats took advantage

of every miscues.

Presbytcrian’s touchdown was
set up in the first quarter on
a.55 yard pass play from quart-
erback Bob Waters to halfback
Bobby Pate. Pate was hauled
down on the six yard line, but
P.C. fullback Bill Hill plunged
over from the one, two plays
later. The pass for the extra
points was blocked by Harold
Bynum.

Citadel Tops Xittens

In Lancaster Contest

By JERRY RICH

football team to a 28-8 win over Davidson's Wildkittens
at Lancaster on October 10. .
Sam Jackson scored David-
son's only touchdown with a 2-

points were tacked onto the .
score when Jackson passed to *
Duncan Morton.

Coach Tom Stevens said of
the team. “They played a pret-
ty good game. Citadel just had
more boys. We did well until
we started tiring in the fourth
quarter. The team did fairly
well, considering there. were

not many substitutes.”

GOOD WORK
