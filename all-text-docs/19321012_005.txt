cont d to show up in
the play of the Wildcats, and as a re-
sult they came off the field Friday aft-
ernoon with;one of the most impressive
victories we have ever seen a Davdison
football team chalk up. If the Wild-
cats have ever played a game that has
been more exciting for the spectators
than Friday’s game-with Wofford Col-
lege, it is not in our memory. Time after
time we observed perfect blocking and
brilliant open field running which
brought the stands to their feet.

Improv

Nor was there any outstanding star in
Friday's game. Every: man’ seemed “to: be
playing with ten others, and it was just such
teamwork as that which gave Davidson her
six touchdowns. Coach Newton started a
different backfield combination against Wof-
ford, but before the game was over every
back on the squad had a chance to show
his wares. And every one did. Six touch-
downs were made by the Wildcat§ and each
time the goal by a
back.

Buck Mills, who had not seen much
action in previous games, showed up
well during the afternoon and reeled off
a 73-yard run for the longest individual
jaunt of the game. Joe Wingfield, John-
ny Mackorell, Fred Fleagle, Charley
Pearce, and Billy Flinn added thrills to
the contest when each got off for long
runs. :

The blocking of Peabody, Hutchins, Mills

and Willson“also was a feature of the game. |

Davidson Wildcats Will
Battle Improved V. M. I.

Virginians Make Effective Changes in
Their Methods of Defense and
Offense Formations

On next Friday morning a band of *twenty-
eight Wildcats will leave the college headed
for Lexington, Va., where, on the following
day, they will meet the Cadets of the Vir-
ginia Military Institute on the gridiron. The
team is leaving early in the hopes of prac-
ticing a little Friday afternoon after they
arrive at their destination. -

V. M. I. presenting a much heavier
team this year than usual, outweighing the
Wildcats several pounds to the man. Sev-
eral changes also appear in their methods
of both defense’ and’ offense. Against The
Citadel last Saturday they showed that they
were extra strong on passing, scoring their
lone touchdown by the aerial method. By
changing their offensive position from a
double wingback to-a-single wingback they
present a much more powerful formation
with which to compete the visitors.

Although in former games this year the
| Cadets have not made such an excellent
| stand against their opponents, still it must
he ‘noted that they have encountered three
strong teams, only one ofswhich the Wild-
cats have met. In the first game of, the
year they lost to Kentucky by 23 to 0, and
in the second Duke defeated’them 44 to 0,
but on last Saturday they showed much im-
provement against The Citadel, especially in
| their offensive game, and scored one touch-
down while holding the, Bulldogs to two.

In Bill Smith, quarterback, and M. Urik,
halfback, V. M. I. has a pair that should
give the ‘Cats trouble both in the air and
through the line. Smith has showed up ex-
ceptionally well as a passer and line-plunger,
while Urik excellent on’ blocking and
broken field running. Fred Urich, at end,
is the shining light of the Cadets’ line. He
and Sniitk will be the nucleus of their pass
llattack, '

Past scores show

is

that Davidson has no
easy job ahead of her in winning this gaine.
In 1930 V. M. I. defeated the Wildcats 6 to 0,
but last year lost..to them by the score of
7 to 0.-If the team works together Saturday
as well as-they did last Friday, the game
| may come our way, but then it will be by
|a mighty close margin.

“All-Americans” Hold
Abbey to 0-0 Score

called upon to carry the ball, but whenever |

they were assigned to take out a man, they
did it. The line, led by Wagner and Whit-
field, but minus the services of Captain Bud-
dy Gardner, did its share in Davidson’s vic-
tory. Time after time Wagner broke
through Wofford’s line and threw opposing
backs for losses. Morgan, Morris, Hand,
Rives.and McElrath turned in excellent per-
formances.

Coach Newton surprised us when he
/trotted out Julian West to replace Mc-
Elrath at center Friday. The former Ba-
Yiuth Springs backfield ace after being
moved around from position to position
this fall was tried’ at center for the first
time last Thursday. He did such a good
job of. it that Newton sent him in against
Wofford, and his play in the game forced
the coach to call him a “find.”

(

For the Wildcats’ next game, we predict
a four-touchdown victory for them over the
Cadets of V. M. I. The Virginians have
failed to register on the win column this fall
and will be out to annex the Davidson game
if they can. It is true that they have met
strong teams in Kentucky, Duke- and The
Citadel, and that they will be trying all the
harder to avenge the 6-0 defeat handed them
last year by the Wildcats, but we still think
Davidson has the better team this fall.

By their impressive victory last Fri-
day the Wildcats showed that they are
capable of doing most anything when it
is necessary. We think that they will
get going and smother the Cadets by at
least four if not more touchdowns.

The Wildkittens should defeat the Wof-
ford Freshmen, although the South Caro-
linians have a team which has been playing
together for several years. Captain Cathey
should lead his teammates to a three-touch-
down victory.

Intra-fraternity campus football competi-
tion will begin this week. The sport offers
exercise for not a few students who other-
wise would fail to go in for sports.

Displaying an amazingly air-tight defense,
the Davidson scrubs, prominently known as
the “All-Americans,” played the highly-
touted Belmont Abbey gridders to a“score-
less tie on the latter's’ field last Friday. Play-
ing practically the entire game in Abbey ter-
ritory, the Davidson boys had an edge over
their opponents, but although they came
within striking distance several times, the
effense could not,.click in order to %ather
the final scorifg punch, the affair ending
with a goose egg in both scoring columns.

LeGare was the outstanding performer
for the Wildcat understudies, and his play
at fullback was particularly sensational.
The remainder of the backfield also came
into promitience by intercepting a number of
Belmont passes.

It was not a game that brought the stands
to their feet, as was the one at Davidson on
the same afternoon, in spite of the ideal

Jack Wagner, stellar Davidson tackle,

the varsity, has been outstanding in the
’Cat line this fall.

Freshmen Will Play
Wofford October 14

On Friday afternoon, October 14, the Da-
vidson Freshman football team will play its
second game of the season against Wofford
Freshmen at Spartanburg. The Kittens
opened their season here two weeks ago with
a good start by defeating P. J.-C. 26 to 0.
The remaining games of the first-year men
will be played away from home.

Wofford has: this season one of the. best
teams she has had in a good while, basing
her whole offense around a nucleus of Spar-
tanburg High Players. The team is not as
heavy as that of last, year, but it is much

faster and has an excellent pass defense,

weather and the enthusiastic Belmont crowd.

Davidson’s playing was marred by several|-

fumbles. They tried tricky Washington arid
Lee plays the initiathalf, and failed to score.
In the second half they tried Wofford. plays
but returned to the Davidson system, but
with no better results.

with which they recently trounced Erskine
Frosh,

Last year the Wildkittens had no trouble
in defeating Wofford, but this year will pre-

very strong at that time, but they intend to
make up for it this year and, too, they will
be eager to get back at us for smothering
their varsity.

tion two halves, and an extra fifteen-minute
period were played with no score by either
team. In the second game, neither team
