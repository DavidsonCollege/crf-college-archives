ington & Lee 7-0 Saturday at home.
Senior captain Holt Vaughan
and freshman John Pastel had to sit
out the match because they had
played in an extra match in the fall.
Even without them, though, the
Wildcats swept all the matches.
The match marked the first
opportunity for Davidson sopho-

more transfer Derek Schulze to
face off against his former team.
Schulze teamed up with junior
Scott Tonidandel for an 8-6 win at
the number three doubles spot, and
he then proceeded to defeat one of
his former teammates, 6-4, 6-3, at
the number four singles spot.

“Tt was strange to have to play
against many of my old friends,”
Schulze said, “but it felt good to go
out there and beat them 7-0.” :

Davidson’s next match is
Tuesday against Pfeiffer at 2 p.m.
at home.

Friday, the women’s tennis
team came up a little short in its
first dual match of the season
against East Carolina, 4-3.

Davidson jumped out to a
quick 3-1 lead in the singles after
Kimberly Nance, Ashley Maner

and Lynne Hall won their matches.
ECU fought back, however, in the
remaining singles matches to even
the score at 3-3. The Wildcats fell
short in the doubles and ECU
clinched the match.

“Even though we lost, I felt
everyone played really well,” se-
nior co-captain Kimberly Nance
said. “It was a good start for the
season.”

Saturday, Davidson faced off
against two of their toughest oppo-
nents of the season, South Caro-
lina and College of Charleston.
Despite a quick loss to nationally
ranked USC, the Wildcats fared
much better against Charleston.
They played tough, but ultimately
fell just short again 4-2.

Davidson next plays Tuesday
at 2 p.m. at Winthrop.

After several aborted attempts
to start their season because of
inclement weather, the baseball
team finally began their season
last Tuesday at UNC-Greensboro.
Unfortunately, after four games,
the Wildcats are still looking for
their first victory.

After leading 4-1 through six
innings Tuesday, the Spartans
scored six runs in the seventh and
two in the eighth to win 9-4. Chris
Pollard pitched six strong innings,
giving up just one run on three hits.
Defense was a bright spot for the
Wildcats, as they turned three
double plays. Jeff Andrews, Mark
Reilly and Brian Krehmeyer also
had solid performances.

The women’s lacrosse team
has begun to reach out into the
community to introduce the sport
of lacrosse to local middle school
athletes.

Recently, women’s coach
Nancy Billger and lacrosse team
members traveled to Mount
Mourne School in Mooresville to
hold clinics for fifth grade physi-
cal education classes.

“For most of the young girls,
this was anew experience,” Billger
said. “They learned basic skills
like catching and throwing while
interaction with Davidson play-
ers.”

T he women’s team will open
its spring season Mar. 4-5 at the
William & Mary tournament.

tough Wake Forest team, which
boasts several pro prospects. The
Wildcats lost big, 19-1. Brian
Penny provided all the offense with
a solo home run. Preparing for
ACC conference play, the Dea-
cons tossed seven pitchers at
Davidson, six of whom threw the
ball between 88 and 91 M.P.H..

'  “Weran into possibly the best

pitching staff I’ve seen in my five

years here,” coach Dick Cooke
said. “It’s a good test for us. We
are unexperienced at some spots.
Some guys are still getting their
feet wet.”

Saturday, Davidson traveled
to Western Carolina for a double-
header and were swept by the Cata-
mounts, 7-0 and 5-2. In the first
game, Davidson had 12 hits but
could not get arun. Western Caro-

‘lina helped out, their cause out by

turning three double plays. Mark
Reilly led the way for the Wildcats
with four hits in four at-bats.
Davidson committed four errors,
which led to three unearned runs.
Jonathan Coulombe took the loss
for the Wildcats, going seven runs

giving up seven runs, only three
earned.

In the second game, Davidson
led 2-1 until the bottom of the sixth
when Western Carolina hit two
home runs and took a 5-2 lead.

Davidson managed nine hits in the
game, all singles. For the day,
Rhett Ingerick went three for six,
and both Gus Quattlebaum and
Brad Edwards went three for seven
on the day.

The Wildcats look to get on
track on Wednesday at UNCC ina
makeup game. On Friday, they
travel back to Wake Forest, hoping
to avenge last week’s loss. Next
weekend, Davidson faces ASU.
