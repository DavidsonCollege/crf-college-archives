Crisis In Athletics

There has been considerable talk recently about the
status of football here at Davidson College.

Columns appearing in past sports pages have
dealt with the positive points of this Davidson sport.

These have prompted me to begin a series
on the problems of subsidized sports at Davidson and
the possible alternatives the college can choose to im-
prove the situation.

Included in this series will be a look at certain
aspects of the sports program such as money, recruit-
ing, allocations for minor sports, and what Davidson
has accomplished in the realm of sports in the past.

In this investigation. we will try to answer the
question “why” to some of the present difficulties
that we are encountering in athletics.

We will also face the pressing question of
“Which is more important: winning, balancing the
budget. or playing for the mere joy of it?”

Look for the series Crisis in Athletics’ which will
begin in an upcoming edition.

Notes and Quotes

Maryland's Lefty Driesell does not want to play in
an organized conference. It sounds abit like an instant
replay from Frank McGuire and the South Carolina
Gamecocks.

Of course, I guess if all my losses came in confer-
ence games, I would be upset too.

Prediction Time

After aitiassing an astounding record of 3-0 in my
recent try at clairvoyance. I am venturing once again
into that nasty predicament that plagues most sports
writers.

Holding off on a prediction on the winner of the
conference tournament for another week. I now see
a big road win for the Cats at Dayton tomorrow.

The Flyers are big and strong, but the Davidson big
men also should have another good game. The Cats
are hot after their recent smashing of Appalachian.

Look for the Cats to take a relatively close win, with
the margin being between seven and eleven points.

The Tournament

The big date for all the marbles in the Southern Con-
ference begins next week on the first day of March.

All eight SC teams will be in this event at Rich-
mond, with the final regular season. standings dic-
tating the first round opponents for each school.

Davidson will go into the tourney with the number
one seeding. The Cats are the most likely choice for
the crown, with Furman staging a close fight for the
NCAA tournament bid.

At the present time the standings for the conference
are:

Davidson 9-1
Furman 11-2
Citadel 6-6
Fast Carolina 6-7
William and Mary 4-6
Richmond 4-8
Appalachian 3-8
VMI 3-8

Tickets are still available for the event. So get your
gal or go by yourself, and truck on up to the Virginia
city and support our boys in their quest for a bid to the
Eastern Regionals first round.

Commendations

The school spirit at the Appalachian game was
brilliant. The student body should be commended for
their performance.

But as we all know, we are saving our best for the
tourney.

When the Davidson starting
lineup Was annouced for last
Thursday's game against Ap-
palachian there was a new
name inserted which brought a
huge ovation from the crowd.
This was Davidson's last John-
ston Gym game of the season
and senior Greg Gerdy had
received his first varsity start

The tans were not. disap-
pointed with Greg's. per-
formance. Greg played well
above almost everyone's ex-
pectations as he more than
doubled his” previous career
scoring totals and helped the
Wildcats deteat) Appalachian
108-81

The game's scoring opened
when John Falconi passed up an
18 footer to feed Gerdy for an
open 20 foot jump shot which
tell through and brought the
crowd to its feet. After about
three minutes of play Coach
Holland removed the ‘‘Gerd”™
from the game and kept him un-
der wraps until midway
through the second halt.

Between Greg's departure
and return the rest of the Cats
dominated the weak Moun-
taineers and built up leads
which reached into the thirties.
When he returned to the game.
Greg continued to delight the
crowd by adding 10 more points
to jack his total to 12 on five for
eight from the field.

In limited action during his
career, Greg had only scored
nine points. This seemed
destined to be the “Gerd” night
as tans had brought “Gerd”
signs and came prepared to see
a big mght from Davidson's
illustrious bench-warmer.

Greg also grabbed four
rebounds in his 12 minutes of

play and came out of the game
with less than a minute to go
receiving another standing
ovation

The other senior on this
vear’s team. captain John
Pecorak. who received his nor-
mal starting role scored only

Swimmers ‘Fired Up’ For SC
Meet After Two Straight Wins

By MARK CONNORS
Staff Writer

“Fired up” for the meet.
Davidson defeated their peren-
nial rival Emory and are now
“shooting towards the Southern
Conference meet this
weekend. according to head
coach Ted Severn

Davidson dropped Emory 62-
50 in a closely contested meet
two weeks ago.

“It was our big meet of the
year. commented Severn.
“Emory has been a traditional
rival and everybody was fired
up for the meet.”

Although fired up, the meet
was very close through the first
eight events.

According to Severn, “The
lead changed hands several
times and it wasn’t until Rusty
Saylor and Larry Urbon took
first and second in the breast
stroke that we pulled away for
good."

Besides Saylor and Urbon,
the Wildcats have several other
standouts at Emory. Jack
Doscher took first in the 200 yd.
backstroke. John Scholer took
first in both the 500 yd. and 1000
vd. freestyle events. Scholer is
the current Davidson record
holder in the 1000 vd. freestyle.

John Knox,
premier diver, took first in both
diving events. and “was a
definite asset to the team” in
the win over Emory.

Davidson's .

Although the entire team
swam very well, Severn em-
phasized the important roles of
team captains Luther Beazley
and Scott Davidson in the vic-
tory. ‘Both Luther and Scott
did an outstanding job in getting
the team up for the meet. They
deserve a lot of credit. They
helped make it a complete team
effort” he said.

Snowed out of Augusta, the
next meet for the nators came
against Johnson C. Smith
University. Although not truly
concerned about the meet, the
Wildcats downed them 66-30.

Skaters Cop

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

The hockey club emerged
with a lopsided 18-9 victory in
their first game last week.

The game was plaved in Con-
cord last Wednesday night with
a Charlotte team. Due to lack of
size, the teams were only able
to skate five players at a time,
something which the Davidson
players were used to. while
their opponents were used to the
accustomed six players on the
Ice

Another factor in favor ot ine
Davidson team was that the

At present the swimmers are
preparing for the Southern Con-
ference meet to be held at
Lexington Feb. 22-24.

Severn commented. “We
should have a tough time
because of subsidization of
other schools. However, we
plan to beat Appalachian after
the close loss earlier this year to
them. In addition, we hope to
put Davidson up there on the
scoreboard. [| am quite op-
timistic and the team morale is
great. We're anticipating the
Southern Conference meet with
great enthusiasm."

rink has no zones painted on the
ice Which makes for a very wide
open game.

The team was able to turn
their home rink knowledge into
a resounding victory once the
game began.

We put our first line out and
we just blew them off the ice.”
said Sean McCormack, “so we
decided to put the second line
out and they blew the other
team off too.” McCormack con-
tinued.

The team has no other games
scheduled at present and will
continue to practice once a
week until some more games
can be scheduled
