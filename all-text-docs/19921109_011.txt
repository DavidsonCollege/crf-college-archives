Rugby Sinks St. Andrews

Set for Saturday's Division II Championship

By Dack Stackhouse

On Saturday, the Davidson
club rugby team travelled to St.
Andrews College for possibly the
toughest Division II match of the
season. A$ expected, and despite
missing several starters due to in-
jury and illness, the Wildcats beat
the Rhinos like a merciless ivory
collector.

The first half was a standoff.
Ordinarily the Davidson scrum,
fronted by the likes of “Menacing
Mike” and Tom Shelburne, can
and does walkall over other scrums.
The Rhinos proved to be tough
competition, but not tough enough
to stop the Davidson pack. Wyatt
Lilly played his first game as
hooker, and the seasoned pack was
completed by Jeremy Potter, Dave
Harding, Patrick Malcor, and
David Rozelle. Together the scrum
played a major role in the 7-4 vic-

tory for the undefeated Davidson
team. The backfield played very
well also; Chris Ross played an
extremely good game at scrum half.
Also in the backfield was the crazy
hooker, Scotch Turner, at fly half,
the dynamic duo of Matt Dormer
and Bob Yarbrough as the centers,
the speedy John Walsh and the
crafty Kelly Shirley on the wings,
and finally that funny talkin’ guy,
Simon Priestly at fullback. As a
unit, the backfield’s playing was
well organized and technically
sound.

In the second half, the Wild-
cats’ play improved, enabling the
team to win the game. Turner took
the ball, and about four players
from St. Andrews, and ran to the
try zone. Not quite able to make it
onhisown, Rossand Walsh pushed
him the rest of the distance for the
day’s only try. Priestly, who was

invaluable in that he single-
handedly saved at least two St.
Andrews tries, converted the try,

making the score 7-0, Soon after- ©

wards, St. Andrews mounted its
attack and managed to score a pen-
alty kick, worth three points. After
that, the Wildcats took charge and
held the rest of the game scoreless.

With this victory, the Wild-
catsare one game away from being
the Division II State Rugby cham-
pions; the next opponent is Wake
Forest University. Having never
beaten WFU, the Wildcats are look-
ing forward to crushing the
‘Deamon Deacons and claiming the
state title. With the title on the line,
the match against WFU promises
to be the most exciting of the year.
The game will be contested Satur-
day, November 14, at 1:00 pm on
the Upper IMAC fields.

Fall IMAC Comes to a Close

By Carla Davis.

As the fall IMAC seasons fin-
ish off, 3-on-3 basketball and
flickerball double elimination tour-
naments wind down and select the
best teams of the season. Fighting
their way through the Men’s A
league 3-on-3 loser’s bracket with
five wins, Minerva came back to
play the Bogarts in the champion-
ship game on Thursday night. As
the winner of the loser’s bracket,
Minerva, an independent team,
would have had to defeat the
Bogarts, comprised of the men’s
basketball coaches, twice in arow.

Playing peacefully and self-
assured, however, thecoaches rose
to the challenge to defeat Minerva.
The Men’s B league champion-
ship game proved more interesting
because the winner of the winner’s
bracket, Cunindahouwse, was up-
set 25-23 on Thursday night by
Under a Bed and Overweight in a
highly competitive and close game.
However, Under a Bed must de-
feat Cunindahouwse again in or-
der to become the B league cham-

pion (The game will be played this
week).

After a frustrating, rain-filled
flickerball regular season, the tour-
namenthas finally narrowed down
the teams to the semi-finals to be
played on Sunday, November 8
and the finals on November 15. In
theintensely competitive women’s
league, the Flying Banshees, 1991
champions, have fought their way
back through the loser’s bracket to
play the only freshman team left,
What?, representing Second Little,
in the semi-finals. The winner of
that game will play the winner of
the winner’s bracket Conner House
next week.

In the men’s B league, com-
prised entirely of freshman teams,
the Penthouse Pros will play the
spirited New York Super Fudge
Club for the right to play the unde-
feated 2nd West Belk team next
week. In an upset in the rain on
November 4, Crunch ‘N’ Munch,
the KA team, beat previously un-
defeated Just Average Guys, the
Sig Ep team. JAG has however,

fought their way back through the ©

loser’s bracket for the chance to
play the suprising underdog Night
Train Express in the semi-finals.
The winner will then be able to
play Crunch ‘N’ Munch next week
for the championship game.

Upcoming ‘in the world of
IMAC before second semester is
5-on-5 basketball beginning the
week of November 16, Rosters are
due on November 9 (special provi-
sions can be made if you contact
Carla at -6644). There will be a
captains meeting at 9 p.m. on No-
vember 11 in the conference room
in Baker Sports Complex. In this
5-on-5 season, there will bea Men’s
A league, Men’s B league, and a
Women’s league. The IMAC Ex-
ecutive Council will meet the first
week in January to discuss rule
changes for flickerball, so if you
have any suggestions, please call
Carla at -6644. As well as a co-ed
volleyball tournament, indoor soc-
cer and street hockey will begin
second semester.
