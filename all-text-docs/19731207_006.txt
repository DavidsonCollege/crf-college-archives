and helped make registration
easy,’’ said Bobby Men-
denhall.

Some students mentioned
that Stone was very difficult to
find. ‘“That man is never in his
office ,”’ one student said. ‘‘It
is no wonder the program is in
such a state of disarray.”’

The most frequently men-
tioned complaint was the need
for a greater variety of team

sports.

“T like the individual sports,
but the small number of team
sports lack a lot. I feel they
should give credit for in-
tramural activities on which
people spend a lot of time,”
said Penny.

Another student who asked
not to be named felt that the
P.E. program should be more
strictly enforced.

Stone emphasized that the
department is expanding its
activities and that six new in-
dividual sports are being of-
fered. These are tumbling,
trampoline, archery, ballet,
modern dance and jogging. In
addition there is no charge for
ballet or modern dance,
although early plans had set a
fee for these classes at $30.

“I am trying to encourage
even those who have finished
their requirements to take the
P.E. courses also,’’ said

Thanksgiving has come and

gone. No one had to eat cold,

turkey. This time.

There was plenty of gas and
hot water at home, only a
small reduction in flights
back. The energy shortage is
over.

This is the reassurance by
which people justify their
beliefs that: a) this is just
another Nixon trick, b) there

. is no need to conserve gas or

electricity, c) there is no real
energy shortage.

So the next time a car goes
past at 70 miles an hour,
remember that the driver is
thinking, ‘‘How can the gas I
use do any real damage?”’

Duke President Terry San-
ford seems to think this way.
He recommended last week
that the school continue to
light its Christmas tree,
arguing that in the great rush
to save energy, only the little
people like Duke would lose.

There are several reasons
for his decision. It may be a
political one. Perhaps Sanford
is ing to resist and em-
barrass his old foe Nixon. San-
ford may be Duke Power's
bulldog in encouraging, by
example, everyone to leave

prophet of Dixie.
governors have strongly ob-
jected to the new energy
policies. There are groun-
dswell movements in Texas
and Louisiana to restrict by
law the export of oil from
those states. With the export of
natural gas to heat New
England, the South may suffer
disproportionately. So, San-
ford may be trying to carry
the cross for all of Dixie and
stand up for the little man.

But none of this is reason
enough to encourage a waste
of when we are run-

and Europe, is run-
out of petroleum pro-

tricity, present production

And while America, with
only five percent of the
world’s reserve of crude oil, is
using over 35 percent of the
world’s energy, Sanford is
telling us to waste it.

One can debate whether
the present shortage of gas
and fuel oil is temporary or
permanent. But scientists
have told us for years to ex-
pect this crisis. No one plan-
ned for it; now people around
us want to ignore it.

Perhaps for the first time
we can understand Buch-
minister Fuller’s term
“spaceship earth.’’ Energy
supplies and natural resour-
ces must be conserved and
cultivated if man’s journey is
to continue. We must start
planning now.

By Christmas our turkeys
and showers may be cold.
Then again, they may not be.
But it is a holiday season, one
for happiness and thanks-
giving. What can we find to be
thankful for?

For one thing, not everyone
is like Terry Sanford. There
are men and women who care
about our resources of .
And the beauty of the land.
They have warned us in the
past against drilling in the
Eastern Gulf of Mexico,
against strip mining in
Wyoming, against covering

with cement and
asphalt.

They won a victory here in
September over Marine
World. They repeat the
message seen on bumper
stickers today, that ‘‘A nation
that runs on oil can’t afford to
run out.”

To see the differences that
care and planning make, you
should travel Southeast from
Whitefish, Montana. Go down
across the Missouri river,
paying respect to the great
trout. Struggle over the Nor-
thern Range of the Rockies
across to the plains of the Big

Platte River, with buffalo,
wildflowers, and a glacier tip
too.

Near the end you cross the
border into Colorado where
the sun on the mountains gives
them water and sky colors.
And it seems that some Indian
artist has painted red and gold
and blue on every rock.

When your trip of 700 miles
is finished, you will have seen
a part of nature that man has
left alone. The trip takes four
months to complete, a little
longer in the winter if you ski.
If time is unimportant, plan
for six.

When you get to Fort
Collins, Col. you see what poor
planning does. Every step of
the last 10 miles is beside a
road or shopping center. Ken-
tucky Fried Chicken, pizza
shops, used car lots.

It seems that so much
culture should be pnisoning
the air. But there is hope.

In the belly of the concrete
and glass Student Center at
Colorado State University,
there is a giant sign. It reads
‘‘Don't Californicate
Colorado."’

Good advice for Carolina.
For Duke University and
Terry Sanford. For energy
ostriches everywhere.
