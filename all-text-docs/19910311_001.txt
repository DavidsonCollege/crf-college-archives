Davidson Hosts Dean Rusk
Environmental Conference

By Jay Chaudhuri
“Don’t go into the mainstream
oflife, and instead find the myster-
ies of life.” Those were the words

U.S. Senator Wyche Fowler ‘62 of}

Georgia recalled as a student from
professor emeritus George

Abernethy during the opening -

address for the Dean Rusk confer-
enceentitled,““Towards A Healthy
Global Environment.”

* Indeed, Fowler said advice
from-Abernathy and other profes-
sors at Davidson have had a pro-
found impact on him as Senator.
“Tt [Davidson] is an underpinning
that plays an important role in
making public policy,” said
Fowler.

A major aspect of Fowler’s
public policy as Senator focuses
on the environment, the topic of
his address last Monday night in
Chambers Gallery. Fowler began
by stating that almost a year ago
the country felt it had “crossed the

Rubicon” due to glasnost, the end
of the Cold War and the fall of the
Berlin Wall. Then suddenly,
Americans learned that the gov-

ernmenthadonly $100 million for
environment policies. “The coun-
try, I seriously believe, never felt

such environmental’ concerns,”

Faculty Executive
Committee Warns Fraternities

By Sean Lind

Ina February 28th letter to the
Presidents of Patterson Court Fra-
ternities, the Faculty Executive
Committee expressed concern
about this year’s seemingly over-
zealous pledge activities. The let-
ter was, in effect, a warning that if
fraternities do not tone down their
pledging and pursue a more re-
sponsible course, administrative
action might have to be taken.

The letter expressed aconcern
over “what seems to be an over-
emphasis on pledge activities
which is detrimental to the princi-
pal purpose for you, yourmembers

and your pledges being at
Davidson.”

The letter also states “It is our
understanding that the CCRL is
presently discussing both thealco-
hol policy of the PCC and the issue
of weekday parties...We expect the
most serious cooperation of the
fraternities and the eating clubs
with the Dean of Students and the
CCRL in all these matters.”

“We can not emphasize too
strongly that we do not expect
pledge activities to infringe in any
way upon the academic life of this
college or the academic perform-
ance of pledges.”

By Ross Sloop

Dr. Holmes Rolston III, a 1953
graduate of Davidson, spoke Thurs-
day morning as part of the NCNB/
Dean Rusk environmental
awareness conference. Dr. Rol-
ston now teaches philosophy at
Colorado State University and
has written five critically ac-
claimed books and about 50
articles on environmental issues.
Dr. Rolston combines philo-
sophical inquiry with his con-
cem for the environment to es-
tablish a new way for individu-
als to view the Earth. Just as
people accept certain human
ethics, he feels that people to-
day must embrace the notion of
an “Earth ethic”. He feels that
people need to view themselves
and others as mutual residents of
the Earth rather than members of

an individual nation or race.

KA pledge trainer James Ma-
son considers the warming "unnec-
essary. Seeing a guy in a bunny
outfitin classis not going to change
my grade from a B+ toa B, but to
appease the faculty, I'll be happy to
slow down the activities."

SAE President Bob Dixon
stated, “We’re trying to improve
things through fraternities and
through the PCC.”

Russ Tisinger, KA Secretary,
said, “Pledge activities shouldn's
be brought up the hill. I don't
support anything ‘that infringes
upon the academic life of the Col-
lege."

Investigative Re

By Kathryn Strickland
Close to 1 a.m. ina graveyard
off campus, a Davidson student
nervously confided to me, “I feel
like I’m talking about a CIA plot
instead of a relationship.” For
two years this female student has
dated another woman. Few people
- not even her roommate - know

about her lesbian relationship.
The student. explained how
she met her girlfriend, a recent
Davidson graduate, during her
sophomore year: “She intrigued
me. When I found out she was a
lesbian, she scared me. Then it
struck me how lonely she must be
here . . . eventually I overcame
my fear and discovered a com-
hilarious

person.”
After her girlfriend graduated,
the student felt alone on campus.
She believed, “Iam so differentno
one can understand me.” Every-
day ini the Union Cafe or at a Pat-
terson Court party, she heard some-
one call someone else a fag or a
homo. Because she preferred
people to view her as a person
rather than stigmatize her as a
“dyke”, the student did not con-
fide in anyone. She felt guilty for
lying to her friends. “Nooneknew
who I was. No one heard me say,
‘Oh my God, I might be gay.’”
As a senior consumed with
issues other than her sexuality, the
studentis now amused by people’s
mi ons. “I think it’s funny

two schools which offer neither

that people actually believe all
lesbians are scary butch bitches
as opposed to attractive and femi-
nine women. .. . I think it would
not only surprise but also educate
people toknow that Iam anormal
student integrated and active on
campus.”

Despite her good humor, the
student acknowledged that
“Davidson has a repressive at-
mosphere.” Of the top 25 liberal
arts schools ranked in the 1990.

Prospectives Visit for
Annual SGA Weekend

By Sean Lind

This past weekend, Davidson
held its annual SGA Weekend, a
program run by the student gov-
ernment in cooperation with Ad-
missions, designed to provide pro-
spective students with the oppor-
tunity to visit and experience
Davidson. Eighty-two perspec-
tives from all over the country
were scheduled to come to
Davidson for the weekend.

Barbara Bixby, Admissions
Counselor and coordinator of the
weekend’s festivities, said the
program was designed to “give
prospectivesa complete picture of
the overall Davidson experience,
including activities at the Union
as well as Patterson Court.” Pro-
spectives were also encouraged to
attend two classes on Friday to get
a glimpse of academic life, Bixby
said.

Kristi Kessler, President of
Davidson Ambassadors and also
a coordinator of the weekend,
added that the program “hope-
fully will help students who have-
n’t narrowed down their choices
choose Davidson.”

The weekend, beginning with
check-in on Thursda¥ afternoon,
offered prospectives a wide range
of activities to choose from.

On Thursday night, prospec-
tives were treated to dinner on
Patterson Court, and then presented
with a “Davidson Overview” in
Perkins Auditorium. Thursday
night featured International Night,
a People Hunt, and Comedy Club.

On Friday prospectives could
attend classes, take tours of the
campus, hear about “Life at
Davidson,” and go to FAC on the
Union Patio. Friday night featured
a reception at the Baker Sports
Complex, a formal Banquet, a
concert in the 900 Room, and a
Midnight Breakfast. Some pro-
spective students later enjoyed the
parties on Patterson Court.

On Saturday, visitors were
treated ' to brunch at Vail Com-
mons, and departure was at 11 a.m.

Amanda Lesesne, a prospec-
tive from Atlanta, GA, summed up
the purpose of the weekend, say-
ing, “I heard that this weekend
made people wantto go Davidson.”
