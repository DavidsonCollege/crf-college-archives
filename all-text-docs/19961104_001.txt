Student files charges for threatening messages

Sophomore Rob Neigert was
arrested Friday night after leaving
threatening messages on the voice
mail of sophomore Robbie Lee.
Neigert, intoxicated, left her a
message saying that he wanted to
“crack [her] neck and break [her]

face” and that she was going to
“die.”

Neigert also cut senior Chris
Machon’s hand to the bone with an
illegal butterfly knife Friday night.
Machon has not pressed charges.

Police are currently investi-
gating the situation and will not
comment on it or release informa-
tion until the investigation is fin-
ished. Neigert has hired a lawyer
and says he would like to apolo-

gize to both Machon and Lee.

As told by Lee, the night be-
gan when Neigert, already intoxi-
cated, started dancing with some
of Lee’s ftiends. Lee was angered
by the aggressive way that he was
dancing and “bothering” them. She
says that she gave him “‘bad looks”
and “shoved” him out of the way
when he tried to dance with them.
She asked some brothers of the
off-campus fraternity, PhiGamma

Delta, to escort him out of the
house.

According to Lee and another
bystander, a scuffle then ensued.
As people attempted to take Neigert
out of the house, he became vio-
lent. Lee was hit by Neigert during
the commotion, but she isn’t sure
if the swing was “accidental or
not.” Neigert was then taken out-

Elections °96

Some students rally for Clinton
or Dole. Some simply
study for the next poli sci test.

What happens tomorrow?
Oh, yeah, Twenty-one year old
night. Biology test. NYPD Blue.

No, really, the fate of our
country for the next four years
will be decided Tuesday night.
Do Davidson students care?

sults: “[Politics] isn’t worth my
time at the moment ... I don’t
know who to believe.”

“T’m not interested in being
one who knows every nuance
about politics.”

Absentee ballots are hard to
get, and time is hard to find. Many
feel that whoever the winner is,
things won’t change. Very few
signs cover campus, and those
that do look like flyers for just
another weekly event. Cynicism
sets in deeply during the college
years.

This attitude, though, is not
unique to Davidson. The entire

disappointment, as Clinton con-
tinues to strongly: dominate the
polls. Dole’s camp continues to
rally, and Dole himself has pro-
claimed that he will not give up.
Even if Dole does lose, though,
many important races around the
country are close. It is possible that
the Democrats will retake Con-
gress. This could determine policy
trends for the next two to four
years as much as the Presidential

election could. B Did

Senate race coverage is not readily
available and seems far away.

However, some believe that
Davidson isn’t completely filled
with apathy. According to Kelly
Cunningham, President of the Col-
lege Democrats, about “one-third
of campus cares about politics, one-
third cares a little, and one-third
doesn’t care at all.”

Cunningham has spent time
this semester registering students
to vote in North Carolina. By
temporarily changing residency,
many people in the Davidson com-

tered to vote in the 12th district.

amount of disillusionment exists,
but the idea that all students are
apathetic is a fallacy. Some fac-
ulty think that, but it’s not true.”

Evidence of this exists: Poli-

role in the current presidential
race.

When the debates were
shown in the same room weeks
before, the room was full of people
and posters. Even the library
broadcasted the debates.

Some formerly apathetic stu-
dents find that as they grow older
politics become more relevant.
“Sometimes [politics are] inter-
esting,” responded one. “[It’s be-
coming more applicable what the
government will do to my life.”

‘‘Into the Streets”
storms campus

By ALLISON DOLPH
Staff Writer

This year, the two-week long
community service drive “Into the
. Streets” will focus on three main
issues: hunger, housing, and the
environment.

The program kicked off Tues-
day with environmental letter-writ-
ing. Students signed petitions to
cut back on logging of national
forests, stop or recycle junk mail at

the post office, and curb the use of
styrofoam and paper products in
the Commons.

The following day, the envi-
ronmental theme continued with a
nature walk led by Dr.David Grant.

About 20 participants began
the nature walk at the creek near
the Senior Appartments, where
they discussed water pollution by
the College Laundry and sewage
overflow.

viewing prospective presidential
candidates for Davidson College.
Dagenhart confirms that
“The committee is not restrict-

When the Board of Trustees
met at Davidson last February,
trustees stated that the president
of Davidson College must have
astrong affiliation with the Pres-
byterian Church, U.S.A.
However, says Dagenhart,.

‘ou looK at only those who are
currently affiliated with the ...
Presbyterian Church.” The
specified affiliation may be
formed, he says, “as a condition
of their becoming president.”

In a statement released last
Friday, the Search Committee
states, “We have conducted some
preliminary interviews andmem-
bers of the committee will con-

spective candidates over thenext
few weeks. Later on we antici-
