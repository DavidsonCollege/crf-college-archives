Watson Scholars to Receive $15,000 in Grants _

By Mary McCrory

After graduation, most stu-
dents look for some form of em-
ployment or continue their educa-
tion in graduate school, law school,
or medical school. This year, three
Davidson graduates will have the
opportunity to continue their edu-
cation in classrooms of their own
design and supervision.

Each of the three seniors, Sara
Carlson, Reid French, and Heather
Tarpley, have been awarded
Watson Fellowships which will
enable them to spend a year inves-
tigating their special interests. The
Thomas J. Watson Foundation
awards 65 such fellowships at 52
participating colleges and univer-
sities, in support of independent
study and travel abroad.

After reviewing 24 short pro-
posals in October, and after con-
ducting brief interviews with ap-
plicants, the Graduate Fellowship
Committee, selected four propos-
als to be sent to the national foun-
dation. Before submittal, the pro-
posals had to be revised and ex-
panded to eight pages. Also, the

applicants then faced hour long
interviews with a representative of
the foundation (in this case, a
Davidson alum).

Sara Carlson plans toresearch
the evolutionary relationship be-
tween breeds of ponies and the ties
between ponies and humans. Her
study will take her to the Shetland
Islands and the Hebrides in Scot-
land, Iceland, Gotland, Sweden,
and England.

While researching for her pro-
posal, “I went through the old travel
catalogues of Boswell and Johnson
to figure out where I wanted to
go,” Carlson explained. These
catalogues, written in the 18thcen-
tury, give accounts of the lifestyles

of the Scottish people, and include
all of the different kinds of ponies
they saw. :

After her year abroad, Carlson
hopes to attend graduate school in
English and eventually write
children’s stories about ponies.
Ponies have been a long-term in-
terest for her, as she grew up with
them, and was able to learn more
about their importance to the Scot-

_tish people when she studied at the
University of Edinburgh during the
-fall of her junior year.

Heather Tarpley will spend
her time in Kenya, Uganda, and
Australia focusing on comparative
owlstudies. This will involve band-
ing the owls to monitor behavior,
and getting in a Land Rover at
night to
“spotlight”
owls. When

area. Such data will help her to

correlate where species live in re-

lation to different terrains.
According to Tarpley, herbig-

gest expenses will be airfare and
living in Australia, though most of
her time will be spent in Africa in
national parks. While in Kenya,
she will use the School for Field
Studies, where she studied during
the fall of her junior year, as a
home base. In Uganda, she will be
staying with relatives of junior An-
thony Mubiro.

When her study is complete,
Tarpley will go on to medical
school at the University of Geor-
gia, where she has already been
accepted. She hopes to pursue a
veterinary career with a focus on
wildlife instead of domesticated
animals.

Tarpley’s research is impor-
tant because it will examine
biodiversity. “Biodiversity ishow
diverse acertain biosphere is. Owls
are one indicator of that,” Tarpley
remarked.

Reid French intends to study
the effects of global recession on
the financing of each nation’s na-
tidfial’and regional theater. The-

* ater companies in those nations

have relied upon state funding, but
are finding their budgets cut by
governments seeking to curb defi-
cits. His study will take kim to the
Netherlands and Great Britain.
During his time at Davidson,

French has conducted economic
analysis of social problems, and
has become involved in theatrical
productions,

During the fall of this year, he
took on complete responsibility for
the production of Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat
as an inde-
pendent
study
project. The-
atrical pro-
duction is a
possible ca-
reer for
French, and he hopes that his
Watson Fellowship will help him
make that decision.

During their year abroad, the
Watson Fellows are studying inde-
pendently for the most part, but
they are responsible for sending 4
quarterly reports of progress on
their research and for financial re-
ports to document their expenses.

The application process for a
Watson Fellowship is Somewhat
lengthy, but those with the initia-
tive for drafting a proposal have a
chance at success. According to
Sara Carlson, “Innovation in your

French

field is critical,” for those inter-

ested in winning a Watson Fellow-
ship.

events will be waiting onthe Town
Green to entice them into doing the
latteras Davidson celebrates Town
Day. Bands, booths, exhibits and
other forms of entertainment begin
at 10:00 a.m. and last throughout
the afternoon. At 5:00 p.m., mem-
bers of the town and college com-
munities are invited to stay for a
picnic on the Green. Parks and
Recreation Director Karen Leonard
reports that the famous Four
Coursemen, the Gethsemane Gos-
pel Singers and the juggling of
News and Photography Director
Bill Giduz will be among the acts
scheduled to perform.

“Town Day is about bringing
the town and college communities
together,” Leonard explained. A
dinner without the preliminary ac-
tivities was heldat the Ada Jenkins
Center in the fall and attracted ap-
proximately 600 people. Given the
added number of events this spring,
she hopes that number to increase

dramatically.

College organizations helping
organize the picnic are Reach Out's
Davidson Together program,
chaired by John Rowe and Kirby
Shealy, and the SGA Solidarity
Committee, headed by Tene
Moore.

“This is a really nice opportu-
nity for the students to take a break
before exams,” Rowe said. He also
noted that this year’s Town Day
differs from that of years past be-
cause it occurs the week before
exams, thus offering students an
added incentive to participate.

Moore pointed out the ben-
efits of increased interaction, be-
tween the student body and the
town population. “We wantto have
adinner that will incorporate Town
Day with the students,” she stated.
In addition to the numerous activi-
ties, “the students have to eat any-
way. Town Day would be a great
place for that.”

he was very receptive to the idea.

The theme of the lake campus
party is environmental awareness.
The Environmental Action Com-
mittee would like to see this event

promote awareness ofenvironmen- —

tal issues “on campus and in the
larger picture,” according to com-
mittee member Sally Atlas. The
committee would also like to get
everyone interested and “excited”
about next week’s Earth Day. In
accordance with the theme, each
of the houses on the court will be
providing a booth based on envi-
ronmental awareness. In design,
these booths will promote envi-
ronmental ideals such as recycling,
decreasing pollution, and conserv-

ing energy.

In addition to the booths, there
will be catered food for lunch from
the Commons and outside venues,

-water activities such as canoeing,

sailing, and swimming, games of
volleyball and frisbee, and music.
There will be a DJ there to satisfy
the tastes of everyone on campus.
Free printed frisbees and cup-hold-
ers will be given away. “The point
is for everyone to feel comfortable
and welcome...I justhope itdoesn’t
rain.” If all works out Petty hopes
that the campus organizations will
plan something like this every
spring. Buses from the Belk park-
ing lot will be available for trans-
portation. In the event of rain, all
activities will be held in Johnston
Gym. ;
