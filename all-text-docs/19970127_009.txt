THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1997

I’min the Union Café the other
day, and I see an interesting sight.
There are four guys— not one,
not two, not three, but four—
standing in line to pay for their
food, and all of them are wearing
jeans or khakis, a t-shirt, a baseball
cap, and a black polar fleece vest.
I live off campus, and I guess
I’m just out of the coolness fashion
loop, but is this the most stylin’
new outfit around or something?
Have I fallen completely out of
sync with the standards of being
hip at Davidson? Why in the blaz-
ing, lava-filled, piping-hot hell am
I even concerned with what any-
body else is wearing?

I'll tell you why: I’ve been a
little bit jittery and extra-grouchy
since returning to school this se-
mester.

You see, I haven’t had a ciga-
rette since January 10th. I’m on
THE PATCH — God bless
Nicoderm. It’s a damn sight better

than going cold turkey, but I’ve
still had quite a few withdrawal
symptoms.

First of all, I’m hungry all the
time and eat about eight times as

night long lifestyle will have to
take a brief break until I get over
not smoking a pack and a half a

I’ve also been getting tired more
easily. Last weekend, I actually

or something serious, he or she
could have died, just because a
couple of college-age boneheads
couldn’t hold their liquor.

It seems to me that on notori-
ously excessive nights like first

-night down and self-selection, the

College should set up an emer-

gency alcohol-poisoning clinic in
the infirmary, which would keep
EMS free to help people with more
pressing emergencies. RLO, if
you’re reading this, please think
about it.

Maybe I’m overreacting. I prob-
ably am. I’ve been a bit of an
obnoxious jerk since quitting, but
some good things have happened.

For example, I’ve discovered
that food has a taste and the world
is filled with things called odors
that my nose can pick up. I also
don’t smell like an ashtray any-
more, and I can walk up the stairs
in Chambers without hacking up a
lung that was pink many many
years ago and spitting it onto the
floor.

I’m learning a lot from the quit-
ting process, and let me give the
non-smokers out there a piece of
advice:

Never, ever start smoking, and
if you do, never, ever stop.

Splitting Hairs

Well, now that the entire
Davidson student population has
received a set of final grades, we
can either grumble, gripe, be sur-
prised (negatively or positively),
or philosophize.

The Opinions section is de-
signed to deal with those and all
other reactions, so I shall continue.

My problem is with Davidson’s
actual grading system, but not on
the part of the professor’s evalua-
tions. An incredibly high percent-
age of the time they are fair and
clear in the“ expectations of the
student.

I think something can be done
about the options the professors
have, though. I mean, the “plus/
minus” system of grading really
does not make much sense to me
anymore.

Davidson is built on the ideal of
any good liberal arts school in that
it stresses “learning for the sake of
learning.” I don’t know how such
specific evaluations of a student’s
performance can help promote that
goal.

I mean, is there really that much
of a difference between a B+ and
an A- student? I am sure they both
cared deeply about the class and
tried hard to receive that grade. I
am sure they both believed in
“learning for the sake of learning”
and were hoping to do their best
and let fate or the professor’ s judge-
ment determine the rest.

Yet, the A- student will wonder
what it takes togetan A and the B+
student will wonder what it takes
to crack into the higher category.

How many more terms should
the B+-student have memorized

facts for a sixth instead of fifth

time for him to get a higher grade?

Should the A- student have spo-
ken five times in each class instead
of four in order. to get an A?

Does the extra effort promote
“learning for the sake of learning”
for either student? I doubt it.

Almost every professor rightly
wishes for the student not to re-
member minor facts about their
class, like the exact name or date of
one painting or historical treaty,
but instead the effects of those
items and how they shaped or in-
fluenced the overall themes of the
course. ©

The “plus/minus” system seems
to undermine that goal in making
students dwell more in the specif-
ics rather than the general picture.

True, in some classes the sys-
tem works well. I can see it fine
tuning a student’s writing skills in
English classes or helping students
remember all the formulas in sci-
ence classes.

Also, the “plus” part of the sys-
tem helps many students appropri-
ately distinguish their efforts or
improvements. We probably
should keep it.

But, the “minus” really only
serves to make students question
what more they have to do to get to

the next level. At aschool where a ©

good portion of the student body
does work hard, it really does not
serve much of a punitive role.

The new system was only put in
placein 1991, and I am sure that it
has benefits we do not easily real-
ize. But we really should talk more
about whether this one works to-
wards promoting the school’s goal
of being a strong liberal arts insti-
tution.

Unfortunately, it seems as if
my comment regarding self-se-
lection in the last issue of the
Davidsonian has managed to be-
come misconstrued due to no fault
but my own. While attempting to
praise the real point of Self-Se-
lection, and detract the focus from
the much-hyped nudity, I have
instead managed to become la-
beled jokingly (hopefully) as a
combination voyeur/pedophile/
serial killer.

these two seemingly conflicting
parts unite and form one: the
human body.

It is this gift of yourself that
is the most important to share
with and cherish in our fellow
man. If people are able to see the
human body as a beautiful wrap-
ping to an even more amazing
interior, we would all be a lot
happier and more confident with
ourselves and others. The poi-
sons of criticism, shame, insecu-

very natural and beautiful

part of ourselves.

.within yourself, you
will recognize it in
others as well.

Thus, what I
am proposing is not
that we convert
Davidson into a radi-

that matters is our own
anyway, so why do we constantly
fight it? In this particular situa-
tion though, I do feel compelled
to clarify myself. However,
please do not see this as a retrac-
tion of my earlier statement in
The Davidsonian, only as an ex-
planation.

The human body is a beauti-
ful work of art to which not even
the most gifted artist can attempt
to give justice. Fat or thin, short
or tall, there is something, some
feature that is beautiful on each
and every one of us. However,
society conditions us early to
believe that if we are not the
stereotypical beauty of the gen-

‘ grin 99. eee ea

stated that physical beauty is most
cherished, do not lie to yourself
and deny this fact.

By advertising the human
body as a mystery, as an object of
pure physical desire, or even worse,
as an object of shame, we are de-
stroying a very natural and beauti-
ful part of ourselves. Our body is
a part of each and every one of us.
However, why does it have to be
the primary focus of constant at-
tention? The exterior appearances
of people change and are commer-

cially distorted and manipulated,
society’s opinion of beauty con- ©

stantly fluctuates. However, when

one has the ability to accept who |

, they are heats and one

waren al ‘

cal, peace-loving community full
of flaming liberals and exhibi-
tionists. Instead, I am asking
each of us to shed the definitions
of external beauty that are stran-
gling our inner lights and de-
vouring the goodness and beauty
that lie at the core within each of
us. We need to see the human
body for what it truly is: a vehicle
that enables us to share the most
perfect part of ourself with the
rest of the world.

We create the standard of
perfection, and thus ironically,
each of us is our own demon.
Love yourself; be proud of your-
self; and others will follow your
