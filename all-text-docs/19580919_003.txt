This is a hard column to write since when most of
you read it, the Catawba game will be history. Therefore,
if I turn prognosticator, I may appear a poor second
guesser or an idiot. This, however, (especially the latter)
has happened before, so here goes.

I base my guesses on the Newberry scrimmage held
last Saturday that was kept as much under the veil of
secrecy as the Cape Canaveral tests. However, I walked
up to the dressing room door, knocked three times and
asked for Sandy, and, after passing through the red

tape. secured admission. Competition opens with Pem-
broke on October 5. followed by
the Wake Forest Meet on the
17! On the 24, a triangular meet
will be held with Furman and
the Citadel. Other meets in-
elude Richmond, Washington
and Lee, V.M.I., N. C. State,
and the big Southern Confer-
ence meet which will be held
at Greenville, S. C., on Nov.
17.

Coach Whittle said that the
team would be a much better
team, more balanced, and ex-

than last years squad.

He also added that McBryde

in Charlotte.

This was my impression. Davidson has a good team,
a fast, big, and smart team. They should win a lot of
ball games, including the Catawba game, if—and some-
one has said that “if” is half of life — if they don’t
throw the ball away.

The style of play was wide open and the gains were

defensive.

Dr.

Coach Dole has had a week to smooth out the terial

ruts and his squad should take Catawba by two or
three touchdowns, but ! believe, that though the
fancy stuff will net yardage, its best purpose will
be to open the defense up to give his fine collection
of backs, primarily Barbee, Wall, and Hart, a little
running room. And of course remember Charlie Ben-

With only one non-letterman

the 'Cat line will have plenty

Dave Warden at the center

quarterback Charlie Benson,
the ‘Cats will pull the cover

off one of the most wide open

Dole has not been sure that the

credible showing.”

ENDS GOOD

At the end positions, which
promise to be plenty busy with
the new open attack, are Harold
Westervelt and Jim Bloomfield.
Both boys are stieky-fingered
and know their way around the
defensive secondary.

Freshmen Compete
In Cake Race

The Class of ‘62 will compete
for fifty culinary masterpieces
in the annual Freshman Cake
Race this Monday at 4:30 p.m.

One of Davidson's oldest
Freshman traditions, the Cake
Race has been run for the last
quarter of a century. The
course has been renovated in
the last two years and the best
time was recorded in 1956 by
Jim Alexander who ran the 1.6
mile distance in about 8:25. Last
year’s winner was Verner Stan-
ley who finished in 10:26.5 min-
utes.

The race is run over approxi-
mately half the cross country
course. and has its starting line
on the lower athletic field. It
winds through the woods near
the R.O.T.C. firing range and
cuts to the right up Erwin
Lodge Road. Those who are able
to master this grueling uphill
grind follow the route past the
old fraternity court on Con-
cord Road, turn past the. Union
and finish on Richardson Field
track.

All. Freshmen are required
to compete except those ex-
cused for football or other spe-
cial reasons. Along with his
choice of cakes the winner will
doubtless be subject to the soli-
