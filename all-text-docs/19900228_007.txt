Children of the Malt®, Part VII:
Beers not yet imbibed: this week’s taste test

covers brews from various countries

By JOHN HUTCHINSON

This week saw the return of Domino’s
pizza guy Charles Houck, Davidson
class of ’89, Joining him for the blind-
tasting session were Bob Pulliam '91
and Jim Walker ’90. Together we tasted
and evaluated 16 beers from countries
already covered in Children of the Malf®.

Lowenbrau: Very bubbly, bitter. Smells
bad, tastes worse. “Tastes like a real
cheap beer or a bad malt liquor” —

Houck. “I would have to be all but
passed out to want this beer” --Pulliam.

Lone Star: Looks like champagne, has
no body. Lacks enough taste to be even
remotely offensive. People who don’t
like beer could drink it. “The price
would have to beat the Beast for me to
want to drink it for a long time”
Walker. “Could be the paradigm of
wimpy beer” —Houck. “Add lemonand
you'd have lemonade” --Pulliam.

Cold Spring Export: Clear, brownish-
gold appearance. Weak, slightly sweet
smell. Bitter, but no real strong flavor.
“Boomerang taste” --it comes back
around. Bud-like body.

Altenmunster: Good, cloudy, burned
golden color with an absolutely hide-
ous. smell. “Butterscotch taste” --
Walker. “Fleeting flavor. I'll give it a B-

“I think it’s too bitter” -Houck.

Innsbruck: Very little carbonation.
Sweet, almost honey taste. “Smells like

son. “A good beer to have with break-
fast” -Walker. “Yeah, I'd put it on my
Golden Grahams, but if I wanted to
drink something this sweet, I'd drink a
Coke” Pulliam.

Labatt’s Carnaval: Heavy carbonation.
Very little body. Very sharp taste. “Real
dry, alcohol tasting beer. Has the feel of
abeer that could mess you up” -Houck.

Killian’s Red: Copper color, smooth

taste. Watery—very little _ thickness.
“Good flavor, but the texture leaves me
wanting. Entirely acceptable but not
outstanding” --Houck.

Samuel Adams Winter: Cloudy, bold
copper color. Highly carbonated. Sweet
smell. Real bitter, spicy (almost cinna-
mon) taste that grabs you. “The taste
fades like a rainbow” --Pulliam. “Tastes
like when you where in 5th grade and
you used to chew up pencil erasers” --
Houck.

Samuel Adams: Sweet, grainy smell.

2.000 miles in VW Rabbit

By WILLIAM SCOUTEN
and
JOHN HUTCHINSON

One of the most successful
roadtrips, of which lamaware,
was spawned by a dual quest.
A pair of guys climbed into a
’82 diesel Rabbit and left their
small liberal arts college one
Friday morning. They headed
north at a terrific rate of speed
didn’t stop until they

reached Toronto, Canada—in’

the Great White North--875
miles and 14 hours later.

They went for two reasons:
topurchase exotic types of beer
not imported into: the United

‘States, and to see a Toronto
_BlueJaysgamein thenew, state

of the art Skydome. They were
successful on both counts.

‘They spent both nights in the

compact car, one on a Toronto
sidewalk and another in an
upstate New York rest area,
neither of which was particu-
larly satisfactory. Yet within
the 65 hours they were gone.
They purchased 15 different
kinds of Canadian non-im-
ports, saw a Toronto Blue Jays
game; wrote 25 post cards back
‘to friends in North Carolina;
drank. beer at two outdoor
cafes; waded i in the American
and Canadian sides of Lake
Erie; saw Niagara Falls twice;
freeloaded a swim and shower
ata Best Western; toured Wag- -
ner, New York; got bounced at

a Niagara Falls bar;and ranout
of money ata toll booth outside
Syracuse, New York. Care to
know where the red light dis-
trict is in Toronto or Niagara

. Falls (yes, even a lover's para-

dise has a red light district)?
They toured those also. Try
College Street in Toronto or
Bridge Street in Niagara Falls.

As we look back on it now,
we laugh....but, we’d do it
again (and have!).

The fuel price was high, the
speed limit was low, John was
occasionally miffed and
peeved, but we took matters
into our own hands, kicked off

See CANADA, next page

Spaten Oktoberfest: Nice amber color,
kind of bubbly. Fruity smell. Almost
woody flavor. “Tastes darker than it is”
--Houck.

Hofbrau Oktoberfest: Brown color.
Almost no smell. Texture leaves a bit to
be desired-too watery.

Hofbrau Dark: Rich, very fulfilling,
very flavorful, but not too heavy. Ful-
fills the high expectations set by its
color. “It’s with this beer that I'd like to
say ‘Hot damn, I’m in grad school’” --
Houck. “You guys would have never
seen this beer tonight if I had remem-
bered how good it is” -Hutchinson.

Lowenbrau Dark: “A poor dark beer.
None of the richness you’d expect,
given the color, but the fact that you can
drink it without vomiting is a plus” --
Walker. “If I couldn’t see the color, I’d
like it. It has the flavor of a pretty good
amber beer” --Houck.

All of the beers tasted in this week’s
session can be purchased at La’Mart
Deli and Wines on Sharon Amity in
Charlotte. Belk of Southpark also has a
wide selection. Many, including Kil-
lian’s Red, Lowenbrau, and Samuel
Adams, can be found almost anywhere.
One, Labatt’s Carnaval, can be pur-
chased only in Quebec, Canada during
January and February. OK, so Carnaval
is impossible.to get. But we had it—-you
can’t blame us for drinking it. . .

Still to come in future columns: Ori-
ental beer, Eastern European beer,
Northern European beer, Scandinavian
beer, beer from countries that should
stick to wine (France, Italy, Greece), and
beer from Ireland and Commonwealth
Countries. (Australia, New Zealand,
Scotland), plus any other assorted. stuff
I happen across and have time to
sample between now and the end of
school!

This column is written out ofa concern that,
~inaquest for quantities of beer, students too”
often overlook the quality.

William Scouten and beer columnist John Hutchinson headed to
Canada two weekends ago. Snow?-Davidson certainly hasn’t seen
any in awhile.
