Men Chase School Records as
Track Season's End Approaches

By Peter Hurtado

Themen’s track and field team
geared up for next weekend’s
Southern Conference Champion-
ships with several near-record per-
formances at the Virginia Tech
Track Classic this past Saturday.
Coach Gary Andrew seemed opti-
mistic about the squad’s chances
of improving upon its respectable
seven-point showing last Febru-

Peter Hurtado (1:58.7) and
Erik McMichael (2:00.6) became
the second and third fastest ever,
respectively, in the indoor 800m
by Davidson runners. Both will
shoot for the record next weekend.

Duncan Spears continued his
domination of the 400m, as his
51.7 clocking is justa tick off of his
own school record in the event.

Lee Sutton continued hischase
of a school record in the shot put
with a solid put of 45' 7"; Sutton
tied the record several weeks ago
and should eclipse the mark next
weekend, —

David Kerns (2:02.5) and Joe
Beach (2:06.6) create quite a strong
800m corps which should chal-
lenge the venerable 4x800m relay
school record.

Tan Stewart, though disap-
pointed with his race, nevertheless
remains one of Davidson’s best

ever in the 3000m (9:08.3) and
should challenge the leaders at the
Conference meet.

Rob King inched closer to the
school record in the 35 Ib. weight
throw; his throw of 40' 2" places
him among the conference elite.

Rafael Candelario (37'2") and
King (36' 1") also posted great shot
put efforts, and should challenge
for points next week.

Coach Andrew is pleased with
the teams progress and will work
this week tocreate the right combi-
nations at the Conference Meet to
top last year’s scoring total.

Swim Team Closes Season This
Weekend in Southern States Meet

By Will Cobb

The Davidson swim team trav-
eled to Durham, N.C., to face the
Duke Blue Devils on February 6th.
Both men and women suffered lop-
sided defeats to the very strong
ACC squad. Despite the losses, the
difficult competition served as an
excellent opportunity to compete
against an extremely tough team
before the team’s final meet this
weekend here at Davidson. The
team took a weekend off to pro-
vide a whole two weeks to prepare
_ for the season finale. The men lost
to Duke by ascore of 141-74 while
the women fell by the score of 169-
47.

In men’s competition, fresh-
men Churchill Hooff and Corey
Bean had the best individual per-
formances while the diving team

sweptall diving competition. Hooff
finished second in the 100, 200,
and 500 freestyles, losing the 100
free by only .07 seconds and the
200 freestyle by .49 seconds. Corey
Bean convincingly won the 200
butterfly by over four seconds.
Senior Curtis Bickers won both
diving competitions with second
and third going to Davidson as
well. The team did miss a few of its
key performances due to conflicts
andanticipatea strong performance
this weekend.

The women tackled an espe-
cially strong team in Duke, and
consistently had difficulty keep-
ing pace with the opposition. In
diving, Paige Hull took second on
the One-Meter springboard, while
Meg Bentley took second in the
Three-Meter competition. Others

continued to post good times as the
season comes to a close and have
maintained steady improvement.

Both squads will compete in
the Southern States Championships
this weekend here at Davidson.
Despite the fact that Davidson has
made excellent progress this sea-
son, so have other teams, which
will make the final meet more in-
teresting. This meet will give the
team an excellent opportunity to
determine where it stands with
other schools, as many different
schools from the South will be
represented. Volunteers are des-
perately needed since this event
will be a three-day competition
with hundreds of participants.

Three Davidson players, Musch,
Heuerand Brandon Williams, were
forced to leave the game tempo-
rarily with bleeding cuts,and Spain
and Jeff Anderson were partici-
pants in a minor brawl with 13
minutes to play.

Said McKillop, “They left us
on the floor with a couple of el-
bows. It’s a military school and
they just took it to us.”

The Bulldogs built a 13-point
lead late in the second half, but
Davidson came back just before
halftime behind Zimmerman. He
hit consecutive three-pointers to
make it 36-30 at the break, and the
game went down to the wire from
there. .

When Williams stole the bal
on the press and scored, Davidson
trailed 59-58 with :42 left. Forced
to foul to stop the clock, the Wild-

cats gave up two free throws to the

Bulldogs’ Lamar Wright and took
possession down 61-58 with :35 to
play. But a confused possession
ended when Heuer’s pass deflected
off Alpert and out of bounds with
16 seconds left.

On the ensuing possession,
The Citadel broke the press deep
for a layup and drew an intentional
foul, and ran to the ten-point vic-
tory. Zimmerman had 15 points
and Heuer 13 points and 12 re-
bounds. Davidson is 1-7 on the
