New

Professors Martin
And Colakis

By CHRIS HUGHES

Professor Dayid Martin is a new face
in the Economics department this year.
Martin comes from the University of II-
linois where he received a Ph. D. in
economics with an emphasis in statistics.
He will teach Economics 101,
Econometrics, Statistics, and Environ-
mental Economics.

As a first year teacher, Martin says
one of his biggest challenges is to trans-
late economic theory to the level of the
beginning 101 level course. However, he
wants to develop as an economist and he
feels teaching will be the best way.

When asked about what brought him
to: Davidson, Martin mentioned the size
and atmosphere of the school. In particu-
lar, he pointed out the advantages of
being at a school with a mixed and varied
program because, he said, economics in-
teracts with history, political science,
and other liberal arts. He feels that the
classes here are competitive but have a
healthy competition as opposed to the
lie, cheat, and steal to win attitude founc:
in other schools.

The Honor Code here also struck him
as important. He said he was surprised to
see it could work so well. To show this,
he talked about a Spanish text book that
has been in the lobby of Chambers for
more than a week because no one wants
to take it. Finally, he said that the size of

Davidson was good for him since he at-

in Indiana.

In his free time, Martin and his wife
Diane, who teaches economics at UNC-
Charlotte, enjoy swimming, biking, and
watching Illinois football, which he fre-
quently discusses before class.

Professor Marianthe Colakis

Among the many changes taking
place in the Classics department is the
addition of Professor Marianthe Colakis.
Colakis comes to Davidson from New
York City where she taught Classics at
Queens College and Brooklyn College.
Prior to that, she was on the faculty of
Trinity College of Hartford, Ct. She
holds a B. A. from Barnard anda Ph. D.
from Yale with emphasis in Senecan
tragedies.

‘Here at Davidson, Colakis is teach-
ing Elementary Greek, Readings ih Latin
Prose and Poetry, Intermediate Latin,
and Mythology. Teaching remains her
first priority, and she wants to interest as
many people as possible in the study of
Classics, she said. In her spare time, Col-
akis loves cooking and movies.

Coming from New York, Colakis has
obviously found many things different
about life at Davidson. Most impor-
tantly, she has found the weather in
North Carolina much more hospitable.
She said she is also impressed by the
friendliness of the faculty and students
here and the small town atmosphere. As
opposed to Yale, she has found no “town
and gown” disputes, she said.

She compared it to her time at schools
in New York adding that “in an urban
campus, life doesn’t revolve about the

campus.” Most of the students would
come to classes and lead an entirely sepa-
rate life outside of school, she said. Her
biggest adjustment so far, she said, was
driving a car, since there are no taxis or
buses in Davidson.

Professors
Corrigan And
Albinder

By TEMO TARRAGO

Something Classics Professor Peter
Corrigan, who joined the faculty here
this fall, thinks he will miss this year is a
cold and white Christmas. Davidson may
get cold, he said, but nothing compared
with his hometown of St. Paul, Minn.

Corrigan earned his B. A. at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota, then he moved east
to Comell University, where he received
his M. A. and is presently finishing his
Ph. D. All three degrees are in Classics.

He is happy to be part of Davidson's
Classics department, because, he said, it
is a unique program with opportunities,
such as the major in Classical Civiliza-
tion, which are not available in most
small colleges.

Though his move to Davidson had
some complications, he finds it a clean
and attractive community, with a “post-
card charm.” He believes that Davidson
has many benefits lacking in other
schools, such as its small-town atmos-
phere near an urban community and the
attention paid to each student.

He noticed that people here are warm
and the students are healthy-looking; the
climate here, he said, may have some-
thing to do with it.

One of Corrigan’s biggest impres-
sions is the dedication and commitment
of the professors. He is still getting ad-
justed to the huge demand of time in in-
stitutional functions. That may be why
he has not visited the lake campus yet,
even though he enjoys sailing.

Professor Frank Albinder

Davidson's new music Professor
Frank Albinder is a Los Angeles native
who received his B. A. in music from
Pomona College in California and two
masters degrees from Boston's New
England Conservatory of Music. When
Boston's big-city atmosphere and lack of
Mexican restaurants became too much.
Albinder headed for North Carolina.

He found the change rewarding.
Davidson's atmosphere reminds him of
Pomona’'s friendliness and sense of com-
munity, he said.

Albinder considers students here in-
tcllegent, eager to cooperate and learn.
and he notices they have good relation-
ships with professors.

He has met a number of students in-
terested in music, he said, but many con-
Sider it a hobby rather than an academic
pursuit and do not devote as much time to .
it as they would like.

Albinder's field is music written be-
fore 1750. Singing is one of his main ac-
tivities, and he travels regularly to sing
bass baritone in a choir. Between his tra-
vels he finds time to practice his cooking
and watch “I Love Lucy” reruns.
