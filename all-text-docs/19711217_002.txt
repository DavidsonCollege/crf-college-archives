Influential Positions Taken
By Underclassmen In Senate

By TOM BRUCE
Staff Writer

The SGA Senate meeting Dec.
8 was definitely ‘‘Freshman
Night” with the underclassmen
playing a central rote in mo-
tions affecting the new social
system, improvement of park-
ing facilities, and the problem
of replacing the Union.

Freshman Senator Bill Smith
proposed a committee of the
existing freshman senators to
make an in-depth study of ‘‘the
situation on Patterson Court.”
The idea for the committee was
preceded by a debate at a pre-
vious Senate meeting that re-
vealed dissatisfaction about the
friendliness of the social clubs.

Freshman Class President
Steve Canterbury charged that
the present eating clubs were
more cruel in ignoring the fresh-
men than the fraternities had
been in selective bidding.

Other freshmen senators con-
curred that the eating clubs are
a source of tension in the class
and that they should be sub-
jected to close analysis. Smith
indicated that he would circu-
late questionnaires to the fresh-
man class before the Christmas
recess.

Senator Robert Corlew report-
ed that he had received initial
favorable opinion from the ad-
ministration about some _ pos-
sible new uses for accumulating
traffic and parking fines. .

The proposals. would revert
funds to the Senate, after de-
ducting operating expenses, to
improve present parking fa-
cilities or in other ways ‘‘for
the benefit of the entire student
body.” Corlew stated that this
involved a large amount of mon-
ey since $2000 was collected
during the first term for vari-
ous violations.

Bill Lear had earlier report-
ed the need for a ‘“‘traffic and
security committee’ that would
proved a workable comprehen-

sive parking plan, one that
would anticipate future expan.
sion of the college. The com-
mittee would also make recom-
mendations about the present
security forces.

Senators then issued a ‘‘fu
ture of the Union” compendium
of thought on possible sites for
location or relocation of the
Student Union. Their report
Stated that ten possible sites
for the Union had already been
rejected by college President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. While
the Senate favored a_ location
behind Belk dormitory between
the laundry and _ Richardson
dorm, the administration was
toying with the idea of convert-
ing the College Guest House
into a Union facility. The Sen-
ate voted that the new Union
be constructed in an architec.
tural style consistent with the
twentieth century.

In other Senate action Doug
Brown proposed that the Sen-
ate Executive Committee ap-
point two students to the Gov-
ernance Committee, an import-

ant group designed to elicit
trustee, administration, faculty,
and_ student representation.
From a field of six nominees,
the Senate elected Rich Wilson
and John Hornickel.

RHA Chairman Bill Alexan-
der presented a list of revisions
to the Residence Hall Associa-
tion constitution that were pass-
ed with relative ease. The
stated purpose of the changes
was to make the RHA a non-
enforcement organization, one
that would not make rules or
inflict fines. The new rules will
also provide for a representa-
tive from Grey House for the
assembly.

Bill Meier reported that a
poll was being taken to catalog
alumni sentiment on subsidized
football. A committee led by
Ralph Peeples is examining re-
turned questionnaires finished
by certain students picked by
computer random sample.

The Senate will soon be fill-
ing vacancies on several of the
area committees, vacancies
which are open to all students.

JUST PLAIN FUN?

As nine inches of snow fell on the Davidson campus, on December
3 and 4, some students expressed their joy by throwing snowballs
at each ofher and through closed windows. According to Grover
C. Meetze, Jr., director of physical plant, at least 60 or more
Panes were broken at a cost in the neighborhood of $2 per panc.

Is Campus Governance A Democracy?

AN ANALYSIS
By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

Is there something about a
philosophical mind which re-
sents authority, or is it that this
brand of thinker always speaks
first and loudest when his free-
dom is threatened?

It may sound like a review,
but the question is applicable
to the philisophy department
at Davidson, as well as to other
similar departments at colleges
all over the country.

The recent trustee action on
the college by-laws aggravated
the tension which existed be-
tween the faculty and the ad-
ministration, and objections

from the philosophy depart-
ment, along with other profes-
sors, erupted with new energy.

The administrative reaction
to this wave of protest has been
slow and vague, but some in-
teresting changes in the phil-
osophy department are now
within the realm of possibility.

It all started last fall at a
faculty meeting. Associate Pro-
fessor of Philosophy Alan B.
Brinkley rose to deliver a writ-
ten speech :which criticized the
trustees for its abuse of the fa-
culty on several counts, to the
applause of many of those pre-
sent. .

Since that time the adminis-
tration and trustees have de-
cided that the recent by-laws
will be open for consultation by
faculty and student governance
committees for any considera-
tions which they may have to
offer.

But Brinkley is planning to
resign. It is not official, and he
has made no statement to the
effect. His decision is volun-
tary. He has tenure.

He mumbles things like ‘‘per-
sonal reasons,’’ or ‘‘a family
decision,” but he did say at
one point, “If I had thought I
might be in paradise, I would
not leave it.”

Associate Professor of Phil-

osophy Earl MacCormac spoke
of the characteristic steam gen-
erated by the department as
“‘an affliction of the profession.
Philosophers often believe deep-
ly in the very principles which
they teach.
_ “All of us,” he continued, ‘‘be-
lieve in a liberal democracy
with shared responsibility. When
the trustees do something with-
out due consultation of the fa-
culty, then we are distressed.
Shall the faculty be subject to
the trustees or shall it have a
Say in the organization of which
it is a part?”

MacCormac remarked about
previous discourtesies paid to

the department by the adminis-
tration. He said that when the

department was to be moved
from the first floor of Chambers
to the second floor last vear, the

first word heard by some. of
the professors came in THE
DAVIDSONIAN. There was no
previous announcement,

“My suspicion,” MacCormac
concluded, “‘is that we will be
a three-man department if Pro-
fessor Brinkley resigns. If this
happens, | will have to resign
from the Honors College, which

| enjoy a great deal, to cope
with those students working in
courses toward their major.”
Tomas be a twotnan depart
inem, however, if Instructor of
Philosophy John J. Young dow
not have his contract with the

college renewed.

He has received the unani
recommendation of — the
department, but so far he has
notified
year by the college. The dead
line for notification was Dec. I>.

Green Amendment Fails.
Helps Coeducation Plans

By DOUG BROWN
Asst. Managing Editor

For a while this fall it ap-
peared that a sex discrimina-
tion ban included in an omnibus
higher education bill approved
by the House of Representatives
Committee on Education and
Labor would be an impediment
to Davidson's guing
tional.

coeduca-

Representative Edith Green,
Democrat of Oregon, sponsored
provisions that would have ban-
ned the use of sex as a_ basis
for discrimination in undergrad-
uate and graduate admissions.
In addition sex discrimination
would have been banned in any
other “‘education program. or
activity receiving federal finan-
cial assistance.”

The House has voted down
this sex discrimination ban
down, and this has greatly re-
lieved Davidson's administra-
tion. Vice President for Aca-
demic Affairs John M. Bevan
said, “At first Representative
Green's amendment did enter
into our coeducation plans, and
it would have hampered our
aims. However, now we can
continue to study the question
of coeducation without — this

amendment hanging over us.”

The | only from

Green's

exemptions
amendment would have
been for “substantially” sing!
sex institutions, ‘‘substantially”’
being considered 90 per cent or
more, and colleges controlled
by religious organizations where
the non-discriminatory admis-
sions policy would violate the
sroup’s religious tenets.

A seven year transition per
iod would have been allowed
for colleges in the process of
changing to coeducation to rid
themselves to sex discrimina
tion. The seven years would
date from the time the college
first began the transition.

Bevan indicated that he was
pleased to see the Green amend-
ment defeated, for this would
have been another obstacle to
Davidson's going coeducational.
He pointed out that if Davidson
decided to go coed, it would un-
doubtedly attempt to maintain
some type of male-female ratio.

A number of campus leaders
felt that Davidson was using
the Green amendment as an eX-
cuse for not moving forward
forthrightly on the issue of Co-
education.
