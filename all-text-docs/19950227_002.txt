Lighting to brighten nightlife

Commons, Belk, Richardson, laundry walkways are top priority

By Patricia EvANs
Staff writer

On Feburary 13, Director of
Public Safety and Police Ray
Thrower, Supervisor of Electrical
Maintenance Mack Puckett, and
Director of Physical Plant Bob
Collins, along with SGA Senators
Jonathan Orr, BJ Rudell, and
Lucian Dervan, spent two hours
walking around the Davidson cam-
‘pus in search of dark, potentially
dangerous areas with little or no
lighting. This review has occurred
in response to numerous student
complaints about poor lighting on
campus. The group looked at areas
that had previously needed imme-
diate action.

The group decided that first
priority was the Vail Commons

side of Richardson ‘Dormitory,
along with the entire quadrangle
marked by Belk, the laundry, the
Commons, and Richardson. Sec-
ond priority is lighting the path
from Duke Dormitory to the li-
brary. The third area of immediate
concern is the lighting in front of
Chambers.

Other areas of concern, in or-
der of priority, are lighting on the
Belk side of Chambers, the long
sidewalk from Chambers to Main
Street passing DCPC, the area in
front of the Union, Martin Chem-
istry Building, between Phi and Eu
Halls, and the new parking lot be-
side behind the Senior Apartments.
The group also considered moving
the light at the library’s loading
dock to a more useful spot.

‘Sig Ep fraternity
receives awards from
Leadership Academy

By CATHERINE ANDERSON

Sigma Phi Epsilon recently
won five major awards at the 1995
Southeast Carlson Leadership
Academy Conference.

The fraternity was awarded
the “Excelsior Cup” Award for
Manpower and Scholarship for the
fall 1993- spring 1994 school year.
Billed as the “standard in excel-
lence” for Sigma Phi Epsilon fra-
ternities, the award recognizes
those chapters showing significant
improvement in the areas of man-
power and academics.

The fraternity was also
awarded the Harry D. Kurtz Mem-
bership Recruitment Award for the
spring of 1994, recognizing Sig Ep
as being in the top quartile for
recruiting after they imitiated 33
new members last year.

The chapter was awarded the
Scholarship Cup for having the top

GPA out of all the fraternities on
campus for the fall 1993-spring
1994 school year, the Manpower
Excellence Award for the spring
of 1994 for being in the top quartile
of manpower on campus, and fi-
nally the Dean’s List Award, an
award not unfamiliar to the chap-
ter, recognizing their overall GPA
of over 2.88 for several semesters
in a row.

“[Davidson’s] chapter is tre-
mendously successful in two op-
erations: academics and recruit-
ment. They’re a fantastic chap-
ter,” said Jim Lowry, the regional
director of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
Lowry is responsible for all Sig Ep
chapters in the southeast.

“Because of ourchapter’ s per-
formance at the academy,” said
Sig Ep Service Coordinator Josh
Gaffga, “the name of Davidson
College has been branded into the
minds of the schools of the South-
east.”

process, Puckett is putting together

a master list of all areas and pos- -

sible lighting options and costs;
the list should be complete by the
week of February 27.

In compiling the list, he has
had to examine building tops and
sidewalks. The next step is to
submit a work order to Bob Collins
and the Physical Plant who will
take over installation and mainte-
nance of the new lights. Dervan
stresses that the lights will all goup
one at a time in order of immediate
concern.

Thrower has high hopes for
the lighting: “I’m excited. Each
year we upgrade campus lighting.
This year is just another year when
we’re looking at students’ con-
cerns and acting on those concerns
with the appropriate funding.”

Soon,
there will
be more

of these

on campus.

Ataschool famous for its bone
marrow drive, it seems only right
that the SGA president give his to
a needy patient.

Bill Gullan, recently elected
SGA President, will give his bone
marrow to a 42-year-old male
shortly after spring break.

___, Gullan was perfectly matched
to this man, arare occurrence, after

a long series of tests. Next week
he will have a physical to make
sure that he is able to undergo the
operation, which will remove mar-
row from his hip.

“The only real risk is the anes-
thesia,” says Gullan. All that he
knows at this point is that the op-
eration must be on a Tuesday and
the man is in urgent need of a
transplant.

Gullan has talked to other.

Davidson students who have un-

dergone the procedure on both
sides, and seems excited about the
opportunity.

However, he will not be seen
asahero. “I don’t feel comfortable
accepting praise for this.

The only thing that makes me
feel good is that I was lucky to be
matched with someone in need and
that he was lucky to be matched
with a willing participant,” says
Gullan.
