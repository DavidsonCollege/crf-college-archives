‘Lhe following is an extract trom a
letter received from Robert W. Miles,
‘11, with the Army Y. M,C. A, in
France, notice of whose sailing appeared
‘in Tie Davipsonian:

“Over ‘here in France 1 am pleasantly
-locatéd with plenty to do. My Y. M.
C. A. consists of two rooms on the sec-
‘ond floor of the town hall in this little
French town. 1 am the only secretary
-here and have a great time, you may be
»sure, ‘There is a medical detachment
-billeted downstairs and each day [ have
one man detailed to help me. [Everyone
in the outfit from the commanding of
ficer down, is willing to help. so my
duties are rendered far easier on account

‘of such wholesouled co-operation. My
room is in the home of a French family
that does everything possible to make
life pleasant for me. Really it would
be almost impossible for me to be more
‘pleasantly situated. The French do
everything they can to make life pleas-
ant for all the boys.”

The following is also from a David-
sonian “over there,” coming from Lex

“T am anxiously waiting to receive the

first issue of ‘Vier Davinsonian LE will
receive in’ France. Joe Carlisle and
Capt. Walker Moore are all real well,
and the we are-all working hard. are get-
ting along fine, Most of us are tempo-
rarily “Engineers building barracks,
roads, ete,

“We were at Allentown, Pa.. three
months, then at Camp Mills, and then
across on the largest -hoat afloat. We
made many stops after landing at- va-
rious camps for just a short time. Have
had most interesting experiences. We
are petting our hospital ready, which will
be one of the largest and most complete
army hospitals in’ Europe.”

BOOKS FOR SOLDIERS
‘TO BE COLLECTED FRIDAY

The week beginning March 18 has

oven chosen by the American Library THE SOUTHERN SERVES

Association to solicit boaks to add to the
Libraries of the training camps, and to
end to France for the Y. MLC. A.
tations.

The college and the village made a
collection of about 200 volumes and 200
pamphlets to be sent to Paris Island in
December, but only four or five famities
n the village sent in books, so the com-
munity hay made but little contribution.
On Friday, the 22d inst., a house to
house canvass will be made and any
books suitable for young men will be
gladly received. “The collection will be
held at the Library until its destination
is decided by the State Committee hav-
ing the matter in charge.

Books that interest boys from 12. to
15 can be used for the foreigners who
are just learning to read English, but
eocd new books—books that you have
read, and which will simply lie on your
hook shelves in the future. are asked for.
Books about the war are eagerly sought
by the soldiers, and biography science,
travel, fiction, poetry, etc., if of the type
which the voung man in’ your home
would read. will be of great service.

Don't let vour heart vo pitter-pat
when a voung lady smiles at vou. She

orobably has all she can de to keep from
laughing, ks.
