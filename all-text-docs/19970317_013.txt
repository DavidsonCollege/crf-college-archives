McKillop, Wildcats
poised to dance

(By MICHAEL KRUSE _

It said DAVIDSON COLLEGE
in big red letters on the courtside ban-
ner at the Charlotte Coliseum.

As host of the NCAA Southeast
Regional First and Second Rounds
this weekend, we were-part of the big
dance. :

Technically.

Of course, we'd rather be drink-
ing the punch, not hosting the party.

And after having a few weeks to
reflect on this season and look ahead
tothe next, I believe the 1997-98 men’s
basketball team will be a party-goer,
not just a party-thrower.

The names, numbers, and stats
indicate such. On paper, next year’s
Wildcats have the opportunity to be as
good as last year’s 25-5 NIT team - or
better.

Only Narcisse Ewodo graduates;
everybody else returns. Two top-notch
recruits have been signed and, accord-
ing to assistant coach Jason
Zimmerman, one more is on the way.
In addition, Ben Ebong returns after
this year’s redshirt season.

On paper, they will be invincible
in the Southern Conference. Paper,
though, has never won a champion-
ship. Intangibles, such as team chem-
istry, work ethic, courage, and heart
have.

The basketball squad understands
this better than most, using acohesive,
no-star system of yesteryear to beat
teams it had no business beating from
a purely physical talent standpoint.

And that all starts with coach
Bob McKillop. Great coaching is an
equalizer.

McKillop is not a chaperone, as
so many coaches are these days, des-
perately trying - and often failing - to
control their pampered, big-headed
stars. Instead, he is exactly what a
college coach should be: an instruc-
tor, a motivator, a mentor - on and off
the court.

Now inhis eighth year, McKillop
has built this program into a model of
consistency and longevity, two things
in which he very much believes.

This year - an 18-win season
with an almost entirely new lineup
against one of the nation’s toughest
non-conference schedules - proved
that.

Whether the team will win is no
longer a question. How much, how
well, and when are.

In postgame interviews, oppos-
ing coaches always - first and fore-
most - call McKillop a great coach and
call the Wildcats a tremendously well-
coached team. .

At first, I dismissed this as lip-
service, coach-speak. But continued
lip-service and coach-speak is any-
thing but.

McKillop is not only a student of
the game, he’s a student of life. Asa
New York high school coach before
coming to Davidson, he was.a history
teacher and a headmaster.

He brings that crucial mental as-
pect to the court, as do his players,
appropriate fora Davidson squad. His
team mirrors his personality, his drive,
and his ideals, a rarity these days.

With his stock rising, he has been
offered some high-profile positions
that would maybe pay more.

But he says there are more im-
portant things in life than money. He
believes in loyalty to his job, his team,
and his family - consistency, longev-
ity. He says he is happy here at
Davidson and will not leave any post

Men’s basketball loses in Southern semis
Wildcats’ remarkable late-season run

Chattanooga ends

Wildcats’ balanced
attack defeats Citadel

GREENSBORO — Five
Wildcats scored in double figures
to lead Davidson to a near-flawless
victory over The Citadel in a South-

ern Conference
28 at the

Greensboro Coliseum.
Davidson converted 16-of-17

Quarterfinals

free-throws, including 15-of-16 in
the first half.

Narcisse Ewodo led the bal-
anced attack with 18 points and four
assists. Landry Kosmalski tallied
14, Mark Donnelly 12, and David
Burns ten.

And Billy Armstrong contin-
ued his torrid late-season play, reg-
istering ten points, seven assists,
and four rebounds.

“The multiple contributions
we’ve been. getting recently is the
reason for our success,” said
Donnelly. “Dave (Burns) and Billy
have really stepped it up.”

After falling behind early, the
Wildcats (18-9) used a 25-10 first-
half run over 11 minutes to build a
30-20 lead. And although the Bull-
dogs (13-14) made 62% of their
firsthalf field goals, Davidson main-
tained a ten-point halftime advan-
tage.

“The thing that kept us in the
game in the first half was our foul
shooting. I was not only impressed
with our ability to get to the line but
our ability to finish,” said coach
Bob McKillop. “The fact that we
hadaten-pointlead at halftime while
they shot 62% was impressive.”

Senior star Narcisse Ewodo passes the ball to a teammate while
slashing to the hoop in the Wildcats’ loss to eventual champion
Chattanooga in the Southern Conference semifinals. Davidson
finished the season at 18-10 and look to be poised for an NCAA

run next season.

But The Citadel could not con-
tinue their hot-shooting after the
intermission. Davidson held the
Bulldogs to only 36% shooting and
24 points in the second half.

One factor was the difference
in The Citadel’s shot selection. The
foul trouble of the Bulldogs’
frontcourt - Ryan Sears and Matt
Newman - forced The Citadel to the

perimeter for much of the second
half.

The Wildcats took advantage.
Davidson used a 12-4 spurt over
four minutes to expand their lead to
26. An Armstrong desperation trey
with the shot-clock expiring sealed
the issue, giving the Wildcats a 73-

Inspired Mocs thwart
Wildcats’ upset bid

By MicHAgt Kruse

GREENSBORO — The in-
clination is to call this, all things
considered, a great year.

72% of its offense, four start-

ers, and five se-
when the men’s

basketball team first gathered for
practice back on Oct. 15. Yet the:

Semifinals

Wildcats won 18 games and look to
be poised for another run at confer-
ence perfection next season.

But to dismiss the 1996-97 sea-
son as simply a means to an end
would be unfair to these players.

Next year was too easy. For
them, it was this year.

And it took a powerful perfor-
mance by Tennessee-Chattanooga
to end it, as the top-seeded and
eventual champion Mocs (21-10)
knocked off Davidson in the South-
ern Conference semifinals Mar. 1 at
the Greensboro Coliseum.

Chattanooga, led by aninspired
backcourt performance on both ends
of the court, was able to contain
Narcisse Ewodo and Mark
Donnelly, holding the Wildcats’ two
leading scorers to 13 and seven
points, respectively.

“Tf you had told me that before
the game, I’dhave said we might’ ve
won more comfortably than we did,”
said Chattanooga coach Mack
McCarthy, who tied the league mark
for coaching wins in yesterday’s
NCAA upset of Illinois.

Women’s hoops falls short in league quarters

Tourney loss to Ga. Southern a cruel end to a season of unfulfilled expectations

By MIcHAEL Kruse

STATESBORO, Ga. —
Carolyn Kirsh missed the front end
of a pair of potentially game-tying

free throws

with no time
left, as the
women’s bas-

ketball team fell
to Georgia Southern Feb. 26 in a
Southern Conference quarterfinal.

The 73-71 loss was a heart-
breaking - although fitting - end to
a season of could-haves, should-
haves, and not-quites.

Although they won a program-
best 15 games, the Wildcats’ early
goals for the postseason did not
involve a trip to Statesboro and cer-
tainly not a loss in the quarters any-
where.

But Kirsch’s attempt missed
the mark, sending Davidson home

prematurely and the Lady Eagles to
Greensboro, where they ultimately
lost in the championship game.

“We asked them to take a risk,
to lay it all on the line for fear we
still might hurt like after the Marshall
game (a 67-66 loss to Marshall Feb.
22 in the regular season finale),”
said coach John Filar after the game.

“And that’s what they did. It’s
a shame these two teams had to
meet this early.”

Perhaps, but the game featured
many of the same problems that
forced the Wildcats to hit the road
in the first place and ultimately pre-
vented them from ever truly reach-
ing their original expectations.

The Lady Eagles, using their
superior quickness, often shredded
Davidson’s zone. Fleet-footed point
guard Angelica Rivers consistently
penetrated the Wildcat interior, cre-
ating offense of her own or finding
open teammates on the perimeter -

specifically Tarsha Askew, who fin-
ished with 25 points on 4-for-6
shooting from beyond the arc.

“TI started out on the wing today
and it was just open,” said Askew.
“We knew we had to shoot from
outside to beat their zone. I was
feeling it.”

Rivers added 10 points and six
rebounds.

The game began at a frenzied,
do-or-die pace, but quickly turned
into a foul-infested quagmire.
Twelve of Telly Hall’s 18 points
came from the charity stripe, as the
Lady Eagles took 41 free throws,
converting 33. The two squads
combined for 73 free throws.

“When you get beat with quick-
ness, when you get beat by dribble
penetration, whether you’ re in zone
or man, you end up fouling,” ex-
plained Filar. “It just got to be a
foul-fest.”

Finally, the game was - statisti-

cally speaking, at least - decided at
the line long before Kirsch’s final
attempt rattled out.

While GSU made good on
80.5% of its freebies, Davidson
countered with a typically low
65.6% clip, including a number of
key misses down the stretch.

Onthe bright side, rookie guard
Jen O’Brien scored 18 points, in-
cluding a dazzling 15-point out-
burst in the first half,

Her efforts, along with eight
first-half points from Jennie
Vanlerberghe, accounted for a 31-
31 halftime tie, but were not enough
to extend a season that, after a prom-
ising and expected 11-3 start, sput-
tered through much of the confer-
ence gauntlet.

“You hurt for the seniors,”
sighed Filar. “We should have been
in Greensboro. We should have
been there.”

Indeed. Should have.
