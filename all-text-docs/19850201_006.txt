— Music

By STEVE MANK

The dB’s in their slow ascent to
nationwide recognition are filling a
major gap in pop music. As a genre,
pop music (not popular — that’s Duran
Duran) has been largely ignored in this
country. It seldom is seen on American
charts and just about the only pop act
the states has to offer is Marshall Cren-
shaw. .

But Like This might change all
that. This music grooves. The hooks
work their way in to the unconscious,
forcing you to hum the tunes inces-
santly. The beat drags you to your feet
and makes you flop around like some
marionette gone awry. The lyrics are
simple yet witty and at times even
poignant.

“Love is for Lovers” with its tinny
guitar and pounding drums is the per-
fect innocent backdrop for lyrics like.
“Now every day's like summer vaca-
tion, Christmas and Birthday rolled
into one day.” Vocalist Peter Holsap-
ple isn’t saying anything new, but he’s
saying it well. When he asks some un-

known lover “do you believe this is
love?” you hope she'll say yes beause
this guy's really gone bananas about
her.

The dB’s are much more than great
writers of old-fashioned love songs.
They use their guitars like great

paintbrushes. They create tunes that _

not only say something through words,
but through the music itself. The airy
ethereal mood of “Lonely is (as Lonely
Does)” perfectly complements Hol-
sapples joyous requiem to his own
loneliness. Suddenly the fog vanishes,
the strings fade and the intimate, secret
Holsapple soliloquizes, “living in the
past is tough/ living here today’s
enough,/ the future’s much too far
away. . .”. — enter fog, strings, ef al.
— “‘lonely’s with us everyday.”

The complexity of the dB’s sound
is where their true beauty lies. They
can go from lush orchestration to stark
minimalism without skipping a beat.
They remain a_ basically  guitar-
oriented group, but with each of the
three delightfully adept musicians

doubling on keys the group is capable
of creating most any atmosphere. Pro-
ducer: Chris Butler, from the Todd

Rundgren stable milks the band’s
sound for all its worth.

The combo is just as at home with
rave up soul as with rock. Armed with
a lyric stolen from a Doors song, they
twist it and churn it and funk it up so
much that any comparison would be
absurd. The two-note guitar solos and

Like This Fills AGap In Music Genre

rumbling Hammond organ take you
back to the spirit of 1966 without
necessarily sounding like ’60’s song.”
The dB’s can take influences without
sounding exactly like them. They re not
copping clichés. They're coming up
with new riffs that sound so familiar
that they could be clichés already.

It’s not until the end of the second
side that they begin to differ wildly
from the basic pop format of the rest of
the LP. “On the Battlefront” is an ef-
fective commentary on war —not “‘a”
war or a potential war, just “war.” But
unlike most protest songs, this one
stands on its own as good music which
need not be taken in context.

The dB’s country excursion,
“White Train,” has everything any
self-respecting C & W song should
have: a good ol’ boy, a girl back home,
the ill-meaning devil and, of course,
the white train “takin” me to heaven.”

Like This may not be the first pop
album to come out in America , but
the dB’s put it out to spread a message:
how good pop Is made.

Final Four Prepare For College Bowl Conclusion

By TIM WAPLES
The end of the regular season Is al-
ways a relief to us College Bowl snobs in
the Green Room. Once the playoffs
begin, forfeits are a thing of the past and
very few answers include the name Fred
J. Pooter. Real teams don’t say Fred J.
Pooter.
The final eight real teams squared off
on Sunday in the first round of the
playoffs. Sad to say, losses at the hands
of Buzz Aldrins and Wrong Stuff forced
Boyshot award winner Thundering
Amoebi to hang up the buzzers for the
last time. Even bringing John “Johnny
Flash” Laughlin out of retirement
couldn't get the Amoebi on the winning
track. John James summed it up by say-
ing, “We owe it all to clean living.”
Sunday night was also the last night
for a promising bunch of sophomores,
Les Idiots Savants. After taking Get Out
of the Way down to the wire, they ran
into a pumped-up I Phelta Thi that ended
their season with a rousing 265-145 vic-
tory. Because the Idiots will be depleted
by the JYA program next year, Perry
Matthews offered an interesting variant
on the old Brooklyn Dodgers theme:
“Just wait till senior year.”
The six remaining teams reconvened
on Tuesday night and the ‘Bowl was bet-

Excellent summer counseling opportunities for men

ter than ever. Despite a heroic effort by
Ross Holt and a clutch display of
nationalism by Stu King, I Phelta Thi lost
by a scant five points to Wrong Stuff in
the last second of the game. The
Catatonics also tumbled, dropping
matches against Buzz Aldrins and Skeet-
shooters.

The hot team was definitely Get Out
of the Way, essentially the tournament's
defending champions, who dozed to a 4—
| regular season record and a narrow vic-
tory over The Idiots. The situation
changed when Get picked up the buzzers
against the Skeetshooters. Get cruised to
a big victory, then smashed Buzz Al-
drins, the only undefeated team left from
this year’s action. As the dust cleared at
the end of the evening, Get remained as
the winner of the winners’ bracket.
Wrong Stuff and the Skeetshooters will
meet fof'the right to face Buzz for the los-
ers’ bracket championship and the
chance to get Get.

Of course, Get has long been estab-
lished as the brashest tearfr'in the league
this year. As Senior John Munson said,
“If we play as well as we did Tuesday,
nobody can touch us.” Teammate Ann
“The Meteor” Meador attempted to char-
acterize their potential opponents, the

Skeetshooters, Wrong Stuff, and Buzz

spiritual development. Only those persons who will dedi-
cate their wholehearted efforts to help each individual
child develop his or her potential should apply. One must

lery and backpacking). Horseback riding, white-water
canoeing and tripping are extras in our excellent pro-
gram. For further information write or call G. William

Aldrins: “Rookies, ROTC’s and gentle-
men.”

All the talk is just preliminary,
though, to the action on Monday night.
Beginning at 9:30 p.m. in the Morrison
room the final four will go head-to-head

to resolve the championship. Can the
Skeet shoot to the top? Will the Stuff be
wrong enough? Is Buzz doomed to be
second again? Can Get get there? These
and other questions will all be answered
Monday night.
