P.E. Plan App

Laundry Reviewed

By STEVE BELL
News Editor

The Senate's last meeting of
the year was held Tuesday
night, and it was another 212
hour marathon-the second in
a month. In major business.
the Senate recommended
several changes in_ the
physical education program
and heard from_ ad-
ministrators on the future of
the laundry.

The proposals for change in
P. E were brought to the
Senate by Mark Rabil. chair-
man of the SGA’s ad hoc com-
mittee on athletics. which has
been investigating the issue
for several weeks. Following
surprisingly little discussion
the Senate approved Rabil’s
proposals by a vote of 12-1.
with one abstention

Rabil called for a revision in
the physical education
requirements. from proficien-
ey in four individual sports
and one team = sport. to
proficiency 1n three individual
sports and two team sports

Rabil also suggested that

participation in intramural
sports should satisfy these
requirements Moreover.

Rabil proposed that **...some
credit be given for passing PE
courses, and that PE. classes
be scheduled and registered
for with other courses. . .”’
Rabil emphasized . ‘‘It is not

requirement to ensure that
Davidson students § are
‘physically fit’, but that they
have developed the basic
skills in several sports. These
changes are in support of that
goal.”

College Business Manager
Robert Currie reported to the
Senate on some of the changes
in the laundry’s operation that
should be expected in the near
future. According to Currie, as
a result of the complaints of
discrimination voiced by
many of the students recently.
the compulsory laundry fee
will be extended to all unmar-
ried female students. as well
as the unmarried male stu-
dents. beginning in the school
year 1975-76.

Currie said that it would be
difficult. but the = ad-
ministration hopes to main-
tain the laundry fee at $130
per vear for the next two
vears. After that, the service—
and the fee--will be reduced
somewhat, and beginning in
1978, the laundry service will
become voluntary.

As the laundry winds down.
Curne said that its staff will
need to be reduced. However.
he hopes that jobs will be
found elsewhere within the
college for all who are laid off.

In other business, the Senate
approved a change in the SGA
by-laws that marries the
Residence Hall Council to the
Dorm Social Council. The

merger was strongly ad-
vocated by John Guthrie as a
measure to improve the ef-

ficiency of the student
organizations.
Guthrie complained of

‘inefficiency’ in the RHC, of
which he is chairman. He
reported that the membership
of the RHC voted 4-3 for the
merger.
However. the DSC voted 6-1
against the merger

The SGA Constitution and
By-Law Committee refused to
recommend the merger.
However. the senators as a
whole approved it 12-5. with
one abstention.

Prices Rise

Next vear the cost of a vear s worth of meal tickets at
ARA Slater will be $710. This increase is a direct result
of the minimum wage nike signed into effect by @
President Nixon. The minimum has been $1.60 an hour &
but on May | of this vear the minimum rose to $1.90 and @
by Jan. 1. 1975. the rate will again increase to $2.00 an
hour. The current cost of a vear s board at ARA is $675.

Prices Fall

Those of us returning next vear can face the prospect
of a new Xerox machine charging only 5 cents per copy--
a 50 percent price decrease in an era of spiraling costs.
According to Robert J. Stephenson. Director of Per-
sonnel and Administrative Services. the new machine
will also be faster and produce improved copies.

thusiasm into the lagging JYA
programs.

(Only three Davidson students
had been coaxed into the Ger-
many program during
Fisher's last year here. )

Everyone deserves a chan-
ce, particularly someone in a
new position, but soon the
disorder in the OIE became
obviously inordinate. The only
attempt at publicity for the
programs in the fall was two
poorly organized meetings on
conference day, the first of
which Gaige did not attend,
and the second of which he did
attend but said nothing in the
least that was informative or
enticing about the programs.

Actual JYA application for-
ms were weeks late of the
promised date of availability
merely because the OIE failed
to type them up. Travel
arrangements, usually com-
plete in March or early April,
have only been finalized this
week by Dr. Gaige.

At a request for information
about Eurail train passes, the
OIE secretary's response was,
Pbing a. pry vi not the

thing department
would handle. I don't know
where you would get in-
formation like that.” If one
cannot obtain such _in-
formation in the OIE, what of-
fice should provide it? The
registrar? The comptroller?
The infirmary?

And our applications to the
German university, which we
had thought to have been
mailed to Marburg when we
completed them some three
weeks

before, were
discovered in the OIE just last
week, unmailed simply
because of neglect.

The list of specific crimes
could go on for pages, but
these are all only
manifestations of a pervading
incompetence and
lackadaisicalness in the Office
of International Education.

Fred Gaige is leaving
Davidson this summer,
moving on to greater things.
For the present, members of
the faculty, Winkler, Yoder,
and Meeks, are attempting to
salvage the Germany and
France programs from the
wreckage left in the wake of
Gaige’s havoc. But what about
the future of the Office of In-
ternational Education and
Junior Year Abroad?

_To deny the need for an Of-
fice of International
Education is foolish and un-
discerning. Those members of
the faculty and administration
who would like to see the OIE
abandoned and JYA abolished
have succumbed to David-
son’s infamous tendency
toward inflexibility in
academic matters and have
failed: to understand the im-
portance of foreign study
programs at this school.
