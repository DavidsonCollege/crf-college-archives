as the offense is, Davidson’s de-
fense, which will feature an eight-
man front, may be stronger in both
areas. The ‘Cats have nine starters
coming back for the 92 campaign.

Junior defensive end
Billy Evans, last season’s Defen-
sive MVP, made 84 tackles, recov-
ered two fumbles and recorded
seven and-a-half quarterback
sacks. Junior linebacker John
Dalton contributed 83 tackles, a
pair of fumble recoveries and the
‘Cats lone safety in ’91.

Other defensive stalwarts
should be senior linebacker Martin
McCann, who made 76 tackles and
notched three sacks, sophomore
linebacker Chris Leak, who added
56 tackles and five sacks, and Fight-
ing Wildcat Club Players of the
Year junior cornerback Alden

- Smith, whointercepted five passes,
and senior sone Leonel Benoist,

oy made 43 tackles on broke up
three passes.

As the club understands,
the special teams must perform for
the ‘Cats to achieve overall suc-
cess. Junior Drew Fassett boosted
his punting average to 38.5 yards a
kick last season, and he nailed 16
of21 extra-pointattempts. His field
goal against Washington and Lee
proved to be the difference in the
16-14 conquest of the Generals.

Smith will continue to be
the key man on the return team
units. His 525 kickoff return yards
and 187 punt return yards were
easily team highs‘in ’91. Junior
Chad Blackwelder’s talents, which
included snapping, earned him Spe-
cial Teams MVP and Fighting
Wildcat Clubco-Player of the Year
honors.

Fagg is particularly
pleased with the newcomers’
progress in the three weeks since
fall camp began. “We have twenty

men in the class of 96, and I can |

already tell it will be an exe:

tional class,” he said.

Defensive backs Tom
Bannister, Will Robinson and
Charles Staples and defensiveends
Bo Bartholomew and Tony Frye
have proven themselves early, as
have wide receivers. Jon Bridges
and Tom Haynie and quarterback
Happy O’Brien.

For the time being, the
‘Cats will select captains on a
game-by-game basis. Fenwick and
Loyd will share offensive duties,
McCann will be defensive captain,
senior Matt Matheny will captain
the special teams and Benoist will
be “Captain Crazy”.

Though he understands
that his squad still needs more time
to prepare for the Quakers, Fagg
insists that“we’reon schedule right
now.”

found a leader in Hathaway’s re-
placement at setter, sophomore
Lorie Logan. “I think Lorie is defi-
nitely going to step into that role,”
Blake said. “‘She has just the right
personality to be a setter.” Junior
Jennifer Guise will back up Logan
at setter.

Up front, the Wildcats
should be led by outside hitters

Jennie Wagner, Amy Howard and

Janet Delery. Wagner and Howard
were named co-MVPs at the con-
ference tournament last year.
Wagner also contributes on the
back line, where she led the team
in digs a year ago. Blake also an-
ticipates an immediate contribu-
tion at outside hitter from 5’10"
freshman Michele Augustin, who

has experience in the Junior Olym-
pics. 6’0" junior Katherine Ander-
son will be the ‘Cats’ chief middle

- blocker; senior Rachel Thompson

will have a valuable role as defen-
sive specialist. In the past, she of-
ten has replaced blockers in the
back row to give the team a stron-
ger defensive presence.

The schedule will be a bit
tougher this year because Davidson
will meet a full slate of Southern
Conference opponents for the first
time. Last year, the Wildcats went

‘1-2 against the Southern, with a

win against Furman and losses to
Appalachian State and East Ten-
nessee State. Blake, though, is not
all that concerned about the regu-
lar season. “The important thing
forus is to be real patient early on,”
she said. “Our goal is really our
conference tournament.”
