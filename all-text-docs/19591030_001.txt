Gov. Hodges Pays Visit,
Gives Serious Advice

“Please young men, have a serious outlook on life. Enjoy your football and
your social life, but do not fail to take advantage of this college.” Governor Luther
Hodges leaned over the rostrum in Chambers Auditorium and talked “straight” to

an intent chapel audience.

He spoke as a man concerned
about the welfare of those who
listened, and his voice was
filled with kindness and _ sin-
eerity. Telling of his recent
Russian trip with nine south-
ern governors, he said, “tension
and suspense are part of their
strategy. Keep that in mind in
all your dealings with them.”

The American governors were
concerned with telling the Rus-
sians about our state govern-
ments, and learning from the
Russian system. “I had always
been taught to think of Rus-
sian as, well, slobs or just not
much,” the Governor said. “One
of these days there will be a

revolution and it will all be
over." Governor Hodges with
a wave of the hand said, “neith-
er is true.”

“I don't like a thing going
on there or how they're doing
it, but I am a. better citizen
for having gone.

“] now have a greater ap-
preciation for what we have,
but we are taking our institu-
tions of higher learning for
granted, and it frightens me,”
the Governor said pausing
briefly.

“These are highly intelligent
people. They may seem sim-

ple or plain but they know

what they are doing,” he said
in a somewhat stronger tone.
Pausing again until he was
sure of undivided attention,
the Governor said, “Gentiemen,
they have done their home-
work. They know their history,
they know politics, and world
affairs. But most important of
all, they are dedicated and do- |
ing something about it.” |
The Governor told further of
how extremely friendly the
people were and: that three out
of five of them came up through
farming.
On one leg of their trip the
delegation came upon a wrest-

ti July, he said. Can you please take me? Write back fast.

Hog Anderson and John Kil
lian heralded the festivities
this morning in chapel with an
oration, “What it was, was
Homecoming” and an interpre-
tive dance. Butler Bennett,
for the cheerleaders, and
Charlie. Benson, co-captain of
the football team fanned the
, spark of school spirit with pep
| talks.

The residents of Belk and
first floor Little relinquished
their rooms at 2:30 this after-
noon to the 521 girls who
will be housed there, in the
Preyer Infirmary; the Guest
House, and’a College-owned
home. The afternoon's sched-
ule was rounded out by a soc-

Saturday, November 14,
ROTC nual Freshman PaYents’ Day. This event is
after- year to give the parents a chance to visit the
{noon, and with it came var-'at a time when they will be especially welcomed

Dean of Students John. C.
Bailey has sent out an official
letter of: invitation to all ra
rents of freshmen, setting forth
ithe purposes of the occasion.

In addition, Freshman. Advisor
Bill Whitesell has expressed his
hope that “every. freshman wil!
feel a responsibility to invite
his parents personally. It is a
fine chance for everyone to get
acquainted with the school.”
The day will begin at 9:00
a.m. with registration of all
visitors at the College Union.
Tours of small groups of the
guests will be led by select-
ed freshmen. A fifteen and a

thirty minute tour will be
available over pre-planned
routes.

At 11:00 am., an assembly

will be held in Chambers Au-
ditorium. Dean Bailey — will
speak on the various problems
éncountered by many incoming
freshmen. The Chapel Choir,
|which consists mainly of fresh-
men, will provide a couple of
choral numbers.
| A luncheon will be served at
12:00 in the old dining hall of
}Chambers, to which all fresh-
jmen and their parents are in-
ivited. The cost will be $1.50
| per person.

Highlight of the afternoon
jwill be the football game be-

held. each

Tickets tO the

University game
will be given to the parents,
and. extra tickets may be pur-

chased at $2.50 each.

immediately a f ter the
game, a coffee hour will be
held in the dining hall of
Chambers. This will give the
parents a chance to meet in-
formally their sons’ profes-
sors, friends, and certain
members of the administra-
tion.

Faculty members who teach
freshman subjects will be avail-

able between classes and. will
attend both the luncheen and
the coffee hour. Time will not
permit parents to have long

conferences with faculty mem-
bers, but it is hoped that each
parent will make’ an effort to
meet his or her son’s profes-
sors.

Whitesell again added: “We
hope as many parents as possi-
ble will come on November 14.
The Freshman. Council has put
a lot of work into making this
the best day ever.”

Any freshmen interested in
securing overnight accomoda-
tions for his parents should
contact Bill Boyd, East 207.
Boyd has a list of motels and
hotels in the area, and can ar-
range for students to stay with
their parents.
