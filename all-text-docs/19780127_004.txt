Why for Christians only?

On campus last weekend were the
leaders of the Stuart Scholarship
Program, the group that each year
sifts through hundreds of applica-
tions from high school seniors before
selecting four to receive full $4,755
scholarships to attend Davidson.

The scholarship program was
founded last year in honor of Ed
Stuart, a multitalented young man
who died soon after his graduation
from Davidson in 1956 when his Navy
plane was lost over the coast of
Florida.

One catch

The lucrative and prestigious scho-
larships draw the eye of many
college-bound high school seniors.
But there is one catch: These
important merit-based scholarships
are available only to Christians.

The Stuart family, not the College,
sets the criteria for selection of Stuart
Scholars. These criteria are leader-
ship, scholastic achievement, vigo-
rous outlook, and Christian charac-
ter.

Certainly the family has every right
to establish the criteria they prefer,
but it is to me quite unsettling that
Davidson College’s most prestigious
scholarship program closes its doors
to non-Christians. Last spring, sever-
al hundred students protested when a
non-Christian was denied a place on
the faculty. Since then, the Trustees
have expressed the desirability of
obtaining faculty members who “can
work with respect for the Christian
tradition even if they cannot consci-
entiously join it.”

In other words, Davidson wel-
comes non-Christian faculty who
respect the College’s Christian ori-
entation, but Davidson’s most promi-
nent scholarship program refuses to
consider non-Christian students. The
logic of that situation escapes me.

Unnecessary risk

By denying the Stuart Scholarships
to non-Chrigsjans, Davidson risks
losing two types of students. First;
we risk losing all potential applicants
who are non-Christian. Many of these
non-Christians are veces of high
moral characterd religious con-
viction, and all tyeutd: contribute to
broadening the perspective of David-
son College. Why should these
non-Christians attend a college
whose most prestigious scholarship
program treats them as second class
citizens?

Second, Davidson risks losing
devoted and conscientious Christians
who do not want to attend just
another church school, but instead
seek an educational environment in
which their faith is challenged (and
therefore strengthened) by the ex-
change of differing religious view-
points. The Stuart Program seeks to
‘bring to Davidson outstanding
Christian leaders, but because it
closes its doors to non-Christians, it
discourages truly outstanding Christ-
ians, those who realize that a faith
must be challenged if it is to grow.

With gratitude for the generosity
that the friends and family fo Ed
Stuart have shown in setting up the
Scholarship Program, and with admi-
ration for the accomplishments and
character of Stuart himself, | re-
spectfully urge the Stuart family and
the directors of the Scholarship
Program to reevaluate the criteria for
selection of scholars.

Moral character

| ask that a Scholar be selected on
the basis of outstanding leadership,
scholarship, vigor, and moral cha-
racter. The change of criteria, from
Christian character to moral charac-
ter, is not a major one. The flood-
gates of secularism do not open—the
Scholars will continue to be individu-
als with a genuine sense of their
moral responsibility and a strong

- commitment to spiritual dialogue. All

| think, will be people with whom the
late Ed Stuart would have been proud
to associate.

Avoid provincialism

Keep the criteria as they are
now—lock out non-Christians—and
Davidson appears in the eyes of the
world as a provincial little college in:
the North Carolina Piedmont with a
clear bias against non-Christians and
some rather odd ideas about religious
faith’

Change the criteria, however, and,
the Stuart Scholarship program be-

comes-a vehicle to communicate_to_—

students all across the nation the.

message that Davidson is a college }

which welcomes spiritual and reli-

gious dialogue from al// sides and, ©

unlike many other secular institu-'
tions today, considers this dialogue
to be a vital element in a person’s
education.

Letiérs to thé Editor

Regarding Devon

To the Editor:

Since my opinion was not
solicited when Professor De-
von was being evaluated and,
more importantly, because
that evaluation found her ‘‘not

the best possible,” .I felt my

voice should be added to her
support.

Through word of mouth I
decided to pick up South
Asian Studies 101 and imme-

. diately went up to Devon’s
Office to check it out. “Your

main text,’’ she said, ‘will be
The Wonder That Was India
and I hope by the end of the
course, you'll feel the same
way.’’ She was right. I did a
lot of ‘‘wondering”’ that term.
Mostly it was my western
mind struggling to interpret
the Indian culture into my
own terms, but it did not
work. I had to learn to look at

their ‘‘doings’’ through the.

eyes of the ‘doer, to try and
think and see things as an
Indian might. *

Devon has a way of helping
you to make a long step into
an Indian perspective. She is
at one moment a knowledge-
able professor of Indian Cul-
ture and the next an Indian
peasant describing the daily
joys and hardships of their
lives. These descriptions
brought India alive for me.

In South Asian Studies 102
our discussions reveal a genu-
inely excited professor who
demands that we become just
as involved. At the start of the
course she proposed that the
class determine both the
means of evaluation and the
areas of Indian culture to be
explored. The class, after
years of being handed a sylla-
bus, was hard put to make
these decisions and ultimately
relied on the professor. In
class Devon does not let her
professor role stand as a bar-
rier but blends into the
group's discussion as an edc-
cated peer.

Anyway, my point is that a
professor should be more than
just a storage bank of infor-
mation. Dr. Devon allows the
student room to grow in the
classroom, and I feel I have
grown. Rather than simply
knowing facts about India, I
can begin to understand and
appreciate that country’s im-
mense problems and potential.

So why did I write an article
outlining why I feel Devon is a
good professor? That she is
not the ‘‘best possible’’ is
sufficient reason to dismiss

half the Davidson facutly.

What is the real reason?

JYA is not JYOff

To the Editor:

We hope that our last
contribution to The Davidso-
nian was taken in the right
light and with a sense of
humor. It has been brought to
our attention that if viewed
serously, our caption ‘‘Stu-
dying hard? We're not!”’ could
be detrimental to the reputa-
tion of the JYA Program.

This was not our intention
at all. The picture was taken
and the caption submitted in
September, before we had
even signed up for courses. It
is not academically indicative
of the whole year by any
means.

Junior Year Abroad is not
Junior Year .Off. It is a
challenge in every aspect, and
an invaluable education. There
are sO many things to learn
and experience that could
never be encountered in the
‘Davidson environment.

JYA students are not tak-
ing a year off from their
problems — academic or social.
When placed in a foreign
country without familiar sup-
ports, one has to deal with the
person he or she is as well as
the difficulties of an alien
culture. As such, the year
abroad is an enlightening and
maturing experience. It deve-
lops tolerance and builds con-
fidence in a unique and singu-
lar way.

Our contribution a few
weeks ago was purely a hu-
morous way of letting you
know we are having a good
time over here. And yes, these
days we are even studying a
good bit.
