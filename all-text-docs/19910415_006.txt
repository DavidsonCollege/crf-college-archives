THE DAVIDSONIAN

Don’t Believe the Hype: Laid Back Is Backward

lapologize for delving into the
morass of platitudinous bitching,
but I gota burr in my britches. I’m
from the South and this is not an
attack on the South, its values, its
culture, its dress, its mannerisms.
It’s been done badly too often and
itoffends me. Itis an attack, to use
the violent language of our age, on
what it is to be human at Davidson
College, Davidson N.C., USA,
Earth, Universe.

Sherwood Anderson in the
early part of this century wrote that
aperson who holds onto an idea, or
truth, too strongly, becomes a
grotesque, or freak. The pseudo
way-kind, laid back, good ol’ boy,
great guys around here are freaks.
How is it that I can feel so threat-
ened by such a seemingly non-
threatening way of life? Because
taken to its extreme it represents
blind conformity, fear of original-
ity, and plain ignorance. Them
things are at the core of most evil
committed by humans on other
humans.

Read an editorial on politically

correct language. Here we have an
example of a good idea gone ma-
lignant. 1 submit that here on
campus there is a type of censor-

ship justas invidious. A goodidea, ~

call it calmness of character, be-
comes grotesque. And not to be

having ideas and trying tocommu-
nicate is not cool? Or laid back
enough? Where is the energy and
idealism of our age? We spend our
time drinking, escaping. Is it be-
cause we are bored? Is MTV that
interesting?

Is the point of Davidson to nurture well rounded thinkers? I think
Davidson students are well rounded to the point that they are boring as

hell

celebrated in the way Anderson
celebrates the community of freak-
dom.

This is dangerous freakdom. I
feel somewhat alienated, for ex-
ample, writing an article for The
Davidsonian. At this school there
isa subtle anti-intellectual mental-
ity that sees writing for the paper as
being somehow both. pretentious
andimpotent. Of course words are
just words are just words. But why
subtly censor them with indiffer-
ence?

Writing for the paper is not
cool. Is it therefore safe to say that

Is the point of Davidson to
nurture well rounded thinkers? I
think Davidson students are well
rounded to the point that they are
boring as hell. Well rounded from
taking a band sander to our heads
every weekend getting wasted and
stoned. Work hard, party hard?
Balance? bulls---.

I’mmadas hell. Someone told
me yesterday to chill out. Not to
take things so seriously. Go to hell
I say. Or even worse, be boring.
Don’t you get fired up every time
you go to class and learn all the
amazing things possible in this

world? I go to the library and it is
some sort of manic ecstasy of in-
formation, and I rub myself right
now thinking about it.

No, no. That is what it means
to be a geek. Instead, I am told by
my culture and my peers, I must
cultivate ennui. Doubt, deride
everything. Jaded and comfort-
able, watch television andeat pizza
and drink beer. For every season
turn turn, I know, I know. I know
there’s value in shooting pool,
hanging out withthe commonman,
just being, chillin’, etc.

But there is a war going on
folks. We are all going to die, first
of all. Dried up, stinky dead and
chucked in the hole. Make it an
interesting trip. There’s so much
going on in the world that needs
our utmost attention. We must be
prepared, learn to be most excel-
lenthumans, as Bill and Ted would
add. We must know how to think
for ourselves, but also learn how
other people think. It’s the human-
istic response to the problem of
evil, of course, you’ve all heard

ACADEMY CALLS U.S. TO ACTION

A recent report from the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, the
leading independent source of sci-
entific advice for the Government,
urged the United States “to act
promptly to reduce the threat of
global warming.” Quick action
against global warming, which the
Bush Administration (especially
the stalwart chief of staff Sununu)
has opposed, now appcars to be the
only economically, politically,and
environmentally sound option
available to this country. Many of
the steps recommended by the
academy have been rejected in the
past by the Administration, butit is
evident to most that the recom-
mendations are prudent, practical,
and long overdue.

The Academy stated that there
is clear evidence and wide agree-
ment among atmospheric scien-

lists that: 1) the atmospheric con-

centration of carbon dioxide has
increased 25% during the last

century and is increasing about
0.5% a year; 2) the atmospheric
concentration of methane has
doubled during that period and is
increasing about 0.9% a year; 3)
chlorofluorocarbons are increas-
ing atabout4% per year; 4) human
activities are primarily responsible;
and 5) global average temperature
has risen by 0.5 to 1.1 degree
Fahrenheit in the last century.

The following could result from
these changes: 1) if no effort is
made to reduce emissions, green-
house gas concentrations could
continue to rise, doubling the pre-
industrial level by 2050; 2) this
rise could ultimately increase av-
erage global temperature by 1.8 to
9 degrees Fahrenheit; 3) further
increases in temperature are likely
because the oceans release heat
more slowly than land. Ultimately,
the temperature rise could be twice
as high.

Some of the measures the Acad-

emy called the U.S. to put into
action include adopting nationwide
energy-efficient building codes,

of regulation and tax imcentives,
strengthening Federal and state
support of mass transit, encourag-

ing public education and infor-
mation programs for conserva-
tion and recycling, and sharply
increasing the emphasis on effi-
ciency and conservation in the
Federal energy research and de-
velopment budget.

The recommendations for re-
ducing emissions made by the
Academy are both cost-efficient
and environmentally-sound.
When the forecasted cost to im-
plementcertain suggested actions
is laid out against the potential
reduction of carbon dioxide emis-
sion in metric tons per year, it is
evident that these measures are
the most conservative yet produc-

Notes of a Hanging Judge

By Darry Strickland

In all honesty, I must admit
that earlier drafts of this response
to your column were laced®with
disparaging comments about both
your argument and your persons.
Although it may have been.enter-
taining to call you the “Dysfunc-
tional Duo” and the “Beyond Birk-
enstock Bozos” in print, it would
nothave been constructive. There-
fore, I deleted it from my text.

After an earnest attempt to
ignore their neo-conservative col-
umn all year, your comments of
the last couple issues have engen-
dered what you have sought all
year, attention. Like a child that
soils its pants even when itreaches
maturity, you have soiled the
Davidsonian with your unenlight-
ened and narrow-minded opinions.
Even with my myriad grievances
with your opinions, I still respect
your right to say them.

However, your comments
about the UNLV players, even if it

was a widely held media percep-
tion (a weak justification),
broached an entirely different
arena. I know you did not think
that your off-

nantly claimed you were prejudged.
In my opinion, no it was not neces-
sarily a racist comment, but your
second column shows you really

tiveactions the Governmentcould
take. Forexample, actions such as
increasing energy and vehicleeffi-
ciency holdanetbenefit, after costs,

Americans suffer from a paranoia
that makes them see conspiracies
and plots behind every misfortune.

from your readers, it carried poten-
tial political implications. By the
use of such double entendre, you
sought to tow the line between
offensive language and racist-lan-
guage. Therefore, your statement
carried a price.

You say there was no racist
intent behind your comment. I will
take your word, because one could
argue that pointad nauseam. Butit
was your insensitivity which be-
came painfully apparentafter your
second column, when you indig-

whom youare offering smug solu-
tions.

I don’t buy the line of argu-
ment saying Blacks are hyper-
sensitive to such words, basking in
the victims’ role, looking for ways
to foster a Black-White conflict.
There is nothing romantic or noble
about being a victim of racism or
discrimination. Your quote from
Shelby Steele that stated that A fri-
can Americans badger Whites on
principle makes grand assump-
tions. I do not believe all African

where African American leaders
can place incendiary slogans at
will, and werespond. Some Blacks,
like some Whites, may fall prey to
demagogues, but.to assume that
Blacks have an unusual predilec-
tion to surrender their freedom of
thought to our leaders is unsound
and insulting. :

On the other hand;I guess you
would propose that African Ameri-
cans should notremain vigilant for
instances of racism and discrimi-

about it.

Is this pointless? Am I repeat-
ing myself? I don’t get enough
interchange from enough people
here to know ifIam overkilling the
obvious. Shells and boundaries
everywhere, Fraternity and eating
house boundaries. Work load
boundaries. Personal career
boundaries. We build fences to
protect ourselves from that dry,
stinky hole in the ground.

But perhaps I am guilty of the
same crime by writing acolumn. I
escape into my room and dream
mysterious dreams and fantasies
of some “issue” that must be
brought forward into theconscious-
ness of the minds of the many. I'll
tell you what I’ve learned, though.
The unbearable bulls---involved in
being laid back is a fact of life and
a necessary evil. Image is every-
thing in this society. Sucks don’t
it? I think I’ll crack a beer.

a reduction potential of 300-900
million metric tons per year. Even
the more expensive actions (agri-
culture and reforestation) only cost
between $1 and $9 perton of CO2
equivalent, and have a reduction
potential of 200 million metric tons
per year. Evidently, the Academy
is bringing into light what the Bush
Administration and other naively
conservative phallocrats have
denied; environmental action can
be not only cost-efficient and
beneficial in the long run, but is
also prophetic of our future human
and earthly condition. Environ-
mental protection and efficiency
has left the realm of seriousness .
and entered the realm of essential.
If you want a future, take care of
your earth.

nation knowing that this country
does not have a history of oppres-
sion of peoples of color. Do not
insult me. Laws cannot codify
peoples’ behavior.

Contrary to your assertion, the
UNLV comment, because it was
potentially racist, therefore held
potential political implications,
since it defined and described a
power relationship. ‘When you
were taken to task on their com-
ments, you ran behind the reason-
ing of humor, and supplied out-of-
context quotes from Shelby Steele.

Steele, an African American
scholar-pigeon held by White
conservatives because of his views
about the problems of the African
American underclass and his solu-
tions for them, is only rehashing
the blame-the-victim-argument.

fying your position does not make
