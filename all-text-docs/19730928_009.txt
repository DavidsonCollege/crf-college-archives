Gridders, Apps Clash
In First Away Contest

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

Sports Editor -

Seeking their second win in

as many outings, the Davidson

Wildcats venture to Conrad

Stadium in Boone, N. C. to

tangle with the Appalachian
Mountaineers tomorrow.

Having not beaten the Apps in
their only previous meetings,
the Cats will be out to avenge a
10-10 tie from last season, as
well as trying to up their
seasonal mark to 2-2 overall and
1-1 in the conference.

‘‘Appalachian is really a
strong team,”’ commented head
coach Dave Fagg earlier this
week. ‘Their overall record
at this point is very mis-
leading.”

The Mountaineers are 0-3 on
the season thus far with losses
to Western Kentucky, Furman
and Western Carolina.

Fagg characterized the Ap-
palachian offense as ‘‘fine’’
with a “‘very strong wishbone
attack.” It will be the pri
job of the Cat defense to con-
tain the running game of the
Mountaineers.

“I think we have had some
fine defensive efforts in our first
three ball games,’’ said Fagg.
“‘We have really been under a
lot of pressure.”

Many times the Cats have
been called on to hold an op-
posing offense who has gained
possession within the Cat 40
yard line due to offensive tur-
novers.

“T think Eddie Williamson,
George Weiker and Allen
Schaberg have really anchored
the defense well,’’ explained the
Cat mentor. ‘‘I think that they
will be able to contain the
Mountaineers this weeke!

Harper Leads 20-17 Win Over Bears

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editer

The football team finally an-
swered its critics last Saturday
with a 20-17 win over a favored
Lenoir Rhyne team.

“It was one of the greatest
demonstrations of courage that
I’ve seen in athletics,” said
Head Coach Dave Fagg.

The first quarter of the game
saw both teams go scoreless as
neither could get untracked of-
fensively. The Bears scored fir-
st on a 43 yard field goal in the
middle of the second quarter.
Two minutes later thay added a
touchdown to make it 10-0.

“T’ve seen a lot of teams just
give it up at that point,’’ Fagg
said, ‘‘but those guys pulled
together and hung on to come
back.”’

Davidson's first points of the
year came on a 55 yard drive
with one minute and 30 seconds
left in the first half. With two
seconds showing on the
scoreboard, Dave Harper hit
Gary Pomeroy with an eight
yard touchdown pass.

“I thought Dave did a great
job leading the team to score
with our two minute drill,”
Fagg commented.

Lenoir Rhyne scored on the
first play from scrimmage in
the second half on a 63 yard
pass following a reverse han-

doff to the flanker.

The Cats came back four
plays later with a 62 yard bomb
from Haper to Walker to
make 17-14 in favor of the
Bears.

‘‘A lot of people were down on
Dave after the first two games
because his timing was off, but
that play was timed perfectly,’”’
Fagg commented.

Davidson finally took the lead
with eight minutes left in the
game when Harper sneaked
over from the one yard line.

“The middle was clogged, so I
looked to the left and no one was
there. I just slithered over that
way. It was beautiful,” said
Harper afterwards.

The game was in doubt until
the final gun. But the Cats
managed to hang on after
Lenoir Rhyne recovered a fum-
ble with a minute left in the
game.

The defense came up with
their third solid performance of
the year.

“They've played well in every
game and they're getting better
with each game,” Fagg said.
“And don’t forget that this is
still a very young defense.”

Fagg handed out individual
praise to Tom Fleisher, who
played “‘the best game I’ve seen
from a defensive back on

Richardson Field,” according

Cat Clubbers Tumble
To Outlaws By 26-6

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

The Davidson club football
team lost its second game of the
season 26-6 to Central Piedmont
last Saturday.

Central Piedmont is one of the
perennial powers in the club
football league. The Outlaws
are Central Piedmont’s only
football team and are inclined
to take the concept of club
athletics more seriously than
other schools in the league.

The game was much closer
than the final score indicated as
all of Central Piedmont’s scores
came on big plays. The Outlaws
were more organized than
Davidson and this proved to be
their primary advantage.

Davidson's lone score came
on a six yard run by quar-

terback Jimmy Boyd. The of-
fense was unable to get un-
tracked throughout the entire
game.

There were several bright
spots on the defense as Central
Piedmont was contained for
most of the game. Sandy Car-
negie, Tony Boon and Bob Wet-
zel led the Davidson defense in
stopping the Outlaws.

The club football's problem so
far this season has been the
inability to develop a successful
running game. The offensive
line has also tired late in both
games due to a depth shostage.

Anyone interested in playing
for the team is invited to at-
tend the workouts or contact
Bob Wetzel. Practices are held
at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and
Thursdays.

to Fagg.

Allen Schaberg and Ronnie
Hamilton continued their im-
pressive work at defensive
tackle and defense end, respec-

tively.

Fagg’s loudest plaudits were
reserved for George Weicker
and co-captain Eddie William-
son, however. Weicker had 11
tackles and 14 assists and was

nominated as Southern Con-
ference defensive player of the
week.

‘George was just all over that
field Saturday,” Fagg com-
mented.

Williamson had eight tackles
and four assists to ge with his
first interception of the year.

Against the Mountaineers he
will be up against a very deep
secondary which is very quick
and moves around quite a bit.

Fagg classified their defense
as ‘‘very containi

It will be the ecoming
contest for the Mountaineers
and they are expecting a
capacity crowd in their 12,000
seat stadium.

The offense had been a big
question mark for the Cats
during their opening contests.
But with the exhibition against
the Bears, it seems that quar-
terback David Harper has
begun to click and will be able
to generate the passing attack
well enough to keep the Cats
within reach of their future op-
ponents.

The fate of the Cats this week
May again rest in the hands of
all-American flanker Walt
Walker, along witth split end
Gary Pomeroy and tight ends
Mike Harding and Hal Peacock.

These players all had a fine
game for the Cats against the
Bears and will be out for a
repeat performance in Boone
toniorrow.

Running back Dave Ingold, a
senior from High Point, is still a
questionable starter for the
Cats this week after missing the
Lenior Rhyne clash.

Coed Finds New Challenges
In “Century Run” Bike Race

By LYNNE KEENER
Staff Writer

What is a century run? A cen-
tury run is blisters, newly
discovered muscles, sadistic
car drivers, scenic back roads,
shared physical exhaustion,
and mental satisfaction with
fellow riders.

Before such an expedition can
be made sleep, food, and in-
centive must be provided, but I
figured one out of three was an
acceptable norm.

Equipped with my _ two-
wheeler, official padded biking
shorts, K-Mart knapsack and
six-pack of Gatorade, I foolishly
set off to join the other church
abstainers last Sunday.

Such bicycling activities are
arranged and publicized by
the League of American
Wheelmen, which also works
for the creation of bikeways
through legislation.

The Davidson Lightweight
Cycle Shop locally sponsored
the ‘‘Kudzu Century’’ on Sep-
tember 23, which is the national
date of the annual LAW runs.

At 8:00 a.m. 23 riders (all but
one on 10-speeds) started down
Concord Road. The youngest

was Helene White, a Davidson ©

12-year-old.

The route consisted of three
laps over a 34 mile course.

After one lap of rough roads,
obscene local residents, and
blood-thirsty dogs, I was a bit
winded. However, eighteen
miles and infinite wheel
revolutions later, I walked as
bo-legged as The Duke after a
hard day on the set and I felt
ready to audition for a Ben-Gay
commercial.

Eight cyclists rode 50 miles in
less than six hours (a half cen-
tury), while 13 riders completed
the 100 miles with times ranging
from six-and-a-half to 11 hours.

Snack breaks and pool dips
were enjoyed between laps. A

station wagon patrolled the
countryside, serving as grocery
store, first aid station and
cheerleader.

In short, the object of the cen-
tury run is not the token patch
all successful participants
receive, but to have a fun, en-
joyable, and unforgettable day
cycling in the piedmont coun-
tryside.

The Tarheel Cyclists of
Charlotte are holding a century
run this Sunday for anyone who
wishes to ride. More bicycling
activities, such as overnight
camping trips to nearby parks,
are planned for October by Jane
Nicholls and Alan White of the

local bicycle shop.
