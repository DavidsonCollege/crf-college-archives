To One Man, Not A Word Of Gratitude

---Mr. Plymale, could I in-
terview you for the newspaper?

‘‘What for?”

---Oh, you're kind of a
curiosity on campus.

“Well, I don't know why
anybody would want to ---""

---Well, just let me ask you
some questions and we'll see
what we come up with.

There is a man in Davidson
who lives in a house on N. Main
Street. He came here in 1962 to
work for the college. He worked
hard and well for 10 years. Then
he was fired. Just like that.

But Weston Plymale would
not leave. He was dismissed
from the Business Office under
the direction of C. David Cor-
nell. The reason’ was
“economy”.

But he would not leave. He
moved into the old Vinson
House and found a job in
Charlotte managing a workshop
for the blind. ;

The job is no sandbag. He has
to get up each morning at 6 to be
at work by 7:30.

There until 4 that afternoon,
he supervises people legally
blind making pillow cases and
bedspreads for the government.

Not a great job, but it isn't
every day that a 43-year-old
college graduate is dismissed
for faithful service. Mr.
Plymale hopes to return even-
tually to college work, but for

ALAN BARAGONA.

Postalumnights Congregate,

now he must wait.

Meanwhile, out of “economy”
I find that a new secretary has
been taken on by the business
office.

“Oh, I knew the axe was
coming. But I just decided to
take whatever opportunity was
available when it happened.
The whole matter was very un-
pleasant."’

This is all he will say about it.
And he does not want anyone
else to say it for him. He does
not talk about this easily.

He is a small man who sits un-
comfortably in an easy chair,
crossing one leg over the other.
which barely reaches to the
floor.

He has a habit of letting his
hands hang limply over the
arms of the chair, and he turns
them palm up when answering
a question as though strings
were attached.

This gesture can either mean

‘IT don't know,” or “So what?"
or ‘I don't want to talk about
it,” but on this subject it is
usually the latter case.

He is more willing to discuss
things as they now are than
things that were. He speaks of
his new job, not as a career but
as a challenge. He enjoys his in-
creased involvement with the
Lions Club since he was elected
president just one month after
dismissal from the college.

Still, things have changed.
even with his former friends at
the college.

He still sees some of them oc-
casionally. and he speaks
highly of his former associate
Mr. Currie. ‘A. straight-
shooter, a dedicated and
capable man.”

Yet these are all distant now.
In the student body only a few
juniors and seniors remember
now what an outstanding effort
he made to keep Patterson

Court running financially
through all the turmoil of the
past few years.

The only time Plymale sets
foot on campus anymore is
usually at night when he takes a
2-5 mile jog over the cross-
country course. He is not active
in campus functions anymore.

Loyalties that came easily to
an administrative assistant are
difficult now.

Single but willing, alone but
not lonely, Plymale has made
his way quietly back into life at
Davidson. Not because he wan-
ted to; he had to.

“I have no interest in fighting
old battles. I have better things
to do now than wage a vendetta
with the administration."

---But Mr. Plymale, if you had
spoken up, something might
have been done to help.

‘‘When I left the college I was
determined not to take my case

Anything to improve your

Imitation may be the sin-
cerest form of sycophancy but
according to the ‘‘Sayings of

hesitantly in cereal form by the
‘‘Davoidson Updraft" (from the

the English Language: n. the
movement upward of air or
.some other gas), ‘Americans
have long prided themselves on

Humdeeho!

It's Postalumnight Weekend.
and all the postalumnights are
oozing in and out of the Spring
frolicking, worrying about the
fate of the individual at Davoid-
son.

The Sayings tell us that
enrollment will increase by only
one-half this decade. not at all
the next (no mention of the
why's and wherefores: the P.O.
must have misplaced all those
applications).

And everybody's real worried
about the educational system
Look at the weekend schedule:

2:30 a.m. Capsule Courses:
Topics include °*U.S.-China
Relations — Do we go all the
way from here?™, “Changing
Jeans, Changing People”:

THE DAVIDSONIAN
solicits letters to the editor
on any subject. Letters
placed in THE DAVID-
SONIAN office by 6 p.m.
Monday will ordinarily be
printed that week, as space
permits.

Letters must be signed,
typed, and cannot exceed 300
words in length.

‘What's New on Mars?"’; *‘The
Economics of Price and Army
Cots’: and “A Musical Old
Time Melodramatic Revue
adaptation of ‘Waiting for
Godo’.”

2:31 a.m. Cocktail Hours for
Postalumnights.

4:00 a.m. Address: Clontz Mc-
Dill ‘92, Pres.. Mecklenburg
Postalumnight Association,
Johnston Gym: ‘Subsidized
Football and the Rise of
Cubism."’

4:00'2 a.m. Cocktail Hours,
Loonis McGlohon ‘00 presiding.

See?

And we shouldn't doubt the
postalumnights’ good intentions
just because they all have funny
last names (°43, °67, ‘58. ‘73 soon
— I suppose there is_ in-
dividuality of a sort in
numerical variation).

The proof's in the putting. and
lately everybody's been putting
their foot down on Castle Pinky
and Extended Studies and pret-
ty generally on any idea that
would begin programs of ex-
tensive independent work
unhampered by departmental
jealousies, standardization and
traditional grade-point
evaluation.

Numb reminds me ot the time
we helped a_non-postnighter.
but a good soul steal through the
twilight. lugging the body of a
faculty member nobody has
seemed to miss.

He had dropped dead when
the good soul suggested he do
all the work for a course but
with no evaluation of any kind.

Poor devil. His liver curdled..
Nothing to be done. He was the
third that month.

But we raised a cromlech
over them beside the drugstore.
Called it Stonehead in their
memory.

Well. Castle Pinky has sur-
vived more or less but
everybody agrees that grades.

Phi Beta Kappa and an honor-
studded smile at graduation
are more important to the
student than his sublimated
curiosity. Renaissance men, in-
deed, trooping down the rows of
letter grades contently hum-
ming *Haven...I'm in haven.”

Meanwhile. back in the ‘*Up-
draft’. educators fear that
a reform of _ traditional
educational process might
make Davoidson education “a
purely utilitarian process of
providing the credentials a per-
son needs to earn a living.”
Shattering transformation!

Last year about this time.

that is. about 4a.m.. while Flake-

ly the Cat and I were trying to
break into the foosball machine.
we came upon a glazed-eyed
postalumnight who stumbled in
from Depot St. where the Coffee
Cup had turned down his job ap-
plication.

He wouldn't say much. Just
kept repeating. “I regret to in-
form you the Graduate School.
in Algonquin Studies cannot ad-
mit you without a grade-point
average from your present in-
stitution. I regret to inform vou
we cannot hire you for the
position of Tom’s Peanuts
Quality Controller without a
master’s degree from an ac-
credited university.”

Just like that. And as I look
over my rejection from the
graduate school of Binegar
Bend University, the words spin
round in my head, closer and
closer to my lips.

This weekend, keep an eve
out for glazed-eved postalum-
nights like him. usually. still
dressed in their mortarboards
and Adidas, and you'll see how
many got what they should have
out of their education and how
many plodded along in 10-vear
retrograde because they
retused to bite the hand that
teeds on them.

---Not even bitter then?

I have regrets. and I have a
message for See David Cornell.

Davidson College is not

Yet in the last year of his em-

He was aware. however. that

Just before leaving. he sent a
letter to the president of the

He received replies from

Not a single word.

became obsolete.

Community Spirit
Expands Learning

By ANTHONY S. ABBOTT
Professor of English

A community is a place where two or three are gathered
together. So ought a college to be.

In America we have lost sight of this idea. and as a result our
colleges and universities have become among the loneliest places
in our country rather than arenas where like minded men and
women can gather to teach and learn from one another.

I was talking the other night with a group of students about my
idea of what a college should be. And I said. “It seems to me that
students ought to spend more time learning together. Why don't
you discuss your reading assignments with another? Why don't you
show the first draft of your papers to a friend and get some critical
response?"

One of them looked at me incredulously and said that it would be
a violation of the honor system. Each paper. he thought. should be
written in absolute solitude without any help whatsoever. I paused
a moment and tried to put myself in his place.

1 imagined the dreariness of paper writing for him. and I could
see him coming. step by step. to hate the whole college process.

This kind of thing happens too often. and it happens because
many students. teachers. and administrators do not understand
what a college is.

If paper writing is to be a solitary process. if reading and re-
search is tobe the work of but one person by himself. if learning is but
the reception of information through books and lectures. then it
would be much simpler and cheaper to give all degrees by mail. A
student could listen to taped lectures. go to the library. write his
papers and get his degree with a minimum of fuss.

He would also miss the heart of his education.

In George Bernard Shaw's play ‘John Bull's Other Island”.
Father Keegan. the defrocked priest. is asked what he thinks
heaven is like. He answers:

‘In my dreams it is a country where the State is the Church and
the Church the people: three in one and one in three. It is a com-
monwealth in which work is play and play is life: three in one and
one in three. It is a temple in which the priest is the worshipper and
the worshipper the worshipped: three in one and one in three. It is a
godhead in which all life is human and all humanity divine: three in
one and one inthree. “‘It is. in short. the dream of a madman.”

The imagery of the passage has always appealed to my
imagination. And the phrase “work is play and play is lite” apples
especially to what I have been discussing. College is unnecessarily
fragmented. The student thinks of his studies as work. his social
life as play. and his summer job or the time spent with his family as
lite. He makes a trichotomy (I thought I had invented the word. but I

_ just looked it up and found that it means exactly what vou think it

means) where there ought to be a unity: and the main reason tor
the trichotomy is not the honor system but our traditional
American emphasis on competition.

What is the student most conscious of? — his rank in class.
Fellow students become stumbling blocks to success. hurdles to be
overcome.

Play becomes a frenzied attempt to escape. however brietly. the
grind of monotonous grade point grubbing. and the result is — “1
can't wait ‘till T get out of this dump.”

All of this is unnecessary if one once takes seriously the idea ot
college as community. Work and play and lite can indeed become
one, but only if one first adopts the philosophy that both students
and teachers are fellow learners in need of help.
