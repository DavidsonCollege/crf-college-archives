council which is a »rancn of the
SGA Senate, said that a total
of $48.626 was requesied by
vatious organizations.

“This is about 36.000 more
than we had to spend, so every
proposed budget hac to he cut.”
observed Meier. “We looked at
each item listed as expenses
and tried to vetermine super-
fluous areas. padded in antici-
pation of being cut.

“The Quips and Cranks re-
quested $9,200 for next vear. but
was granted only $8,000, the
Same amoant as its budget for
this year.

THE DAVIDSONIAN was
granted $9,750 for operation next
year, after requesting $10,795.
The increase over this year’s
budget of $6.760 will cover the

The Residence Hall Associa-
tion had a surplus of $223 going
into this year and had_ been
granted $1,050. For next vear.
the RHA requested $2,525 and
was granted $1,550.

The Black Student Coalition
had $483 left over from last
vear, and their budget for this
vear was $300. They received a
substantial increase over this
for next year. receiving $1.000
of a requested $1,375.

Meier stated that the Campus
Tax Council would have some
money left over after these ap-
propriations. ‘‘We always trv
to save some funds to account
for inflation so that the Acti-
vities Fee won't have to be
raised every year.

“This will also go towards
covering any additional requests
that may be made later on in

the year,” he said.

“We worked under the as
sumption that everybody could
use the money well," comment
ed Meier, ‘‘but there's no pre
set system to determine where
and how much a proposed bud
get should be cut.

“It's got to be highly judg
mental,’ he explained. “If we
gave anybody a bad deal, it's
perfectly all right for an organ-
ization to come to the council
and specify reasons which would
justify additional requests.”

The SGA Campus Tax Co::ncil
is composed primarily of stu
dents, in addition to Coliege
Treasurer Robert Currie and
Director of the Union C. Shaw

FCGS Plans Discus

By DOUG BROWN
Managing Editor

In an effort to improve the
competitive position of Davidson
students planning to attend grad-
uate or professional schools, the
Faculty Committee on Graduate
Scholarships (FCGS) has insti-
tuted some new programs.

One of these is an inturmal
discussion session for students
interested in applying tor fellow-
ships next year, or later, which
will be held at 7 p.m. on ‘Tues-
day, May 2. in the Carolina tnn.
Members of the FCGS will ex-
plain the eligibility requirements
and application procedures for
the Rhodes. Marshall, Danforth,
Watson, Fulbright-Hays, Rotary,
National Science Foundation
and Fund for Theological Edu-
cation Fellowships.

Members of this year’s sen-
ior Class who competed for these
fellowships this year will des-
cribe their experiences in pre-
paring applications, being inter-

viewed, and so forth.

It is becoming increasingly
difficult for Davidson graduates
to gain admission to graduate
and professional schools. When
asked to explain why this is
the case Professor of Political
Science J. Harris Proctor, Act-
ing chairman of the FCGS3 said,
“Competition has become keen
er

“There has been 2 ‘liscontin
uation of some progra:ms such
as the Woodrow Wilson Fellow
ships. In some cases the num
ber of fellowships have heen re
duced because of lack of funds.”

Proctor pointed out that some
students are unrealistic in their
goals concerning graduate
schools. A student must be hon-
est in facing his own potential
ities and limitations. Improved

CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD

Warner Hall will call the meeting of the Board of Trustees to order
May 6, at which time the Board will consider the Educational
Policy Committee's report recommending coeducation. They will
also examine the possibility of building new dormitories.

faculty counseling would also aid
students applying to «radiate
schools. ‘In addition to vour
first choice. you should apply
to schools which may not be
your first choice but tiat you
would be willing to go to,"° com
mented Proctor.

Proctor explained, ‘It is hard
to say if the graduate school sit-
uation will get worse. It will
probably stay about the same
for the foreseeable futur>. It
will not improve cdrasticall:.’

However Proctor
“There is a danger in overre
acting to the present Jimited
number of graduate school oven
ings. I believe that students
should be made aware of the
Situation, and it would be ir
responsibile for students to be
encouraged to enter graduate

new professors’ unawareness of
tenure requirements. Professors
sign no formal contract contain-
ing those requirements.

One young faculty member
remarked, ‘‘Until recently, un
tenured professors had little idea
of how they were progressing.”

One requirement made very
clear is the trustee policy that
a professor must ‘‘be an active
member of a Christian Church”
before he can be considered for
tenure. .

Besides the problem of defi-
nition (as Epes- asked, ‘‘What
is ‘active’ and what is ‘Chris.
tian’”’), many professors feel
this is an unnecessary part of
tenure evaluation. Perhaps the
most glaring fault in the present
evaluation system is the lack of
formal student input into the
entire process.

Although Bevan said he and
department chairmen used stu-
dent interviews gauge a pro-
fessor’s classroom effectiveness,
he conceded there was ‘‘no sys-
tematic use of students.”

A professor’s own question-
naire may be the only voice the
student has in evaluation, and
“only secure faculty members
do this,” said South Asia Pro-
fessor Frederick Gaige.

Thus Davidson's evaluation

problems can be traced largely
to the administration's reluct-
ance to define and strengthen
evaluation requirements, the
faculty's laxness in initiating ef-
fective evaluation among them-
selves, and both groups’ unwill-
ingness to include students in
the process.

Though Davidson’s problems
are not unique, it cannot allow
them to continue. Administra-
tion, faculty and students must
create a broader, fairer base
for faculty evaluation.

Next week we will examine
possibilties for change at David-
son, and at other colleges and
universities.

programs without being alerted
on the depressed state of the
job market.

“Nevertheless there is always
some need for the products of
graduate schools, and the op-
portunity is there for outstand
ing students. Although the de-
mand may be less, it is still
there. Some people who would
have gone to graduate school
five years ago should not go
today.”

In past years 70 per cent of
Davidson's graduates have gone
on to graduate or projessional
schools. The FCGS is aware of
this, and according to Proctor
it is making every effort it can.
“However, there are sone ele
ments which are beyond con
trol.”

Proctor also felt that although
70 per cent of Davidson’; gradu
ates may not go to graduate
schools in the future, Davidson
fraduates would have a hetter
chance than those of other col-
leges to attend.

Proctor doubts if there has
been any drastic change in the
methods by which students are
accepted by graduate svciools.
Letters of recommendation by
professors still carry consider-
able weight. He does not believe
that graduate schools have be-
come as mechanized and stan-
dardized in their admissions
procedures as some would think.

“Courses should be chosen
with care," according to Proc
tor. ‘‘There are some courses
which are more helpful than
others, and a student's com-
petitive position can be much
affected by the courses he takes.

Plans Prepared For Coed Recruifing

In anticipation of receiving
the go-head on coeducation from
the Board of Trustees, the col-
lege is preparing a massive re-
cruiting program for prospec-
tive female students, according
to Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan.

Director of the News Bureau
Earl Lawrimore and Director of
Admissions H. Edmunds White
are working together to ready a
variety of ways for advertising
and publicizing coeducation.

In addition to newspaper and

television releases, information
will be immediately sent to 400
selected junior colleges.

The impact of the initial drive
will be directed to possible
transfer students, but materials
will also be sent to high school
counselors for distribution next
fall.

There will be releases to be
sent for publication in church
bulletins and journals, particu-
larly ‘Presbyterian Survey” and
“Presbyterian Life,” and in the ©
alumni newspaper, “Update.”
