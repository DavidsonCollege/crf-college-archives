Frosh Cake Racers
Revive Old Custom

Three freshman cross-country
candidates paced the first fifty
placers across more than a mile
and one-half course Wednesday af-
ternoon in the post-war revival of
the Cake-Course Race.

Establishing the record in the
first running over the new course
was Bill Shipley, of Asheville, beat-
ing Greensboro’s Bill Coe by two
yards after a full sprint by the
two down the last 100 yards. Ship-
ley’s time was 8:57.1. Third man
was Bob Graff, a Kitten harrier,
who was trailed not far behind by
A. P. Boardman, the first of the
real novices to finish, and a strong
runner who may well do future ser-
vice with the thinclad corps.

Fifth through tenth places were
won respectively by Bobby Mur-
ray, Duncan Smith, Johnny Smit»,
John Holt, Clarence Baker, and Joe
Carpenter.

Finishing eleventh through fifty
and eligible for prizes presented

Davidson Freshmen

Journey To Queens

The Davidson freshman
was entertained last Saturday night
by the girls of Queens College in
Charlotte. “Queens Day,” as the
event has come be known,
found nearly 100 students at that
school, both upperclassmen
freshmen taking advantage of the
opportunity to mix socially.

Arranged and planned by the
Freshman class at Queens, the pro-
gram got under way at eight o'-
clock in the college auditorium
with a series of skits including sing-

class

and

ing, instrumental, and humorous
talent. Afterwards, the audience
was free to dance in cither the

day room or the recreation hall,
both of which were decorated with
Davidson’s school colors.
Although 180
signed up to make the trip, only

over freshmen
about fifty actually got to Char-
lotte. Tommy Haller, Pan-Hellen-
ic board member in charge of ar-
ranging the event for the boys was
unable to secure satisfactory trans-
portation, so many students were
not able to go.

The affair was carried on in a
much different manner than in 1949.

Citizens of the town of David-
son have had their peace widely
disturbed during the past several
weeks by a mysterious band of
vandals wearing red caps marked
with the numerals “54”. These ob-
noxious oddities have leaned
against the fire hydrants ( where
available), disturbed the peace sur-
rounding the construction of the
new cathedral, loitered in the Post
office, and made nuisances of
themselves in many other various
and sundry ways.

the Davidson Police Department,

Happy Freshmen Vandals
Desecrate Sacred Water Tower

Beaty, guaranteed that these.
agencies’ slogan would remain on
the Water Tower until it was re-
painted with aluminum paint.

Last week the town fathers notec.
to their horror that the bathing
suit company’s slogan had been
defaced, and the “51” changed to
#*54”. Circumstantial evidence
points directly to the wandering
band of vandals and since the
town faces two heavy breach of
contract suits, they are searching
frantically for some means of deal-
ing with the culprits.

BULLETIN—Davidson, N. C.—
Word has just arrived that the
mysterious mob is connected in
some obscufe way with the col-
lege, and that institution has agreed
to shoulder the responsibility of
repremanding the offenders. The
51 group is expected to ask to
take over job because they
have been grossly insulted by the
desecration of this sacred numeral.
The punishment has not been re-
vealed, but it is rumored that the,
freshmen (as they are now known)
will be enslaved behind the eight
ball for a period of several weeks.

Several citizens have expressed the
hope that this will be a lesson to
the freshmen, and that they can
soon learn to live among their

Betters in peace and harmony.

Last Sunday morning, Reuben
Pea, dishwasher and handy-man
at the S. A. E. boarding house, was
found dead on the railroad tracks
shortly after the 4 o'clock train
passed through, but exact
cause of death had not been deter-
rined at press time yesterday.

It is generally pelieved, and this
has been confirmed by the en-
gineeer, that Reuben was killed
by the train, but the bedy had not
been mutilated extensively, and
Rigor- Mortis had set in only twen-
ty minutes after the body was dis-
covered, so the possibility oi. foul
play has not been ruled out. Reu-
ben had just been paid more than
«a week's salary late Saturday af-
ternoon, and an investigation of

the body revealed that only a few
cents remained of a sum approxi-
mating thirty-five dollars.

Alley section of Davidson, and had

was to give $1.50 to the woik of

Funeral services were held this
week at tre Davidson Negro Me-

by many of Reuben's friends
throughout the community.

Police are still investigating the
death of Reuben, and the coroner
has stated that he had been dead

Davidson Host To
German Students

This year Davidson College has
the pleasure of playing host to two
students from Bavaria, Germany.
Both of the young men, Dieter Ob-
erndorfer Max Stolberg, are
here by way of the program being
conducted in Germany by the high
commissioners for German Reori-
entation.

and

Dieter Oberndorfer, sponsored by
Sigma Chi, is from Munich, Bo-
varia, and was contacted through
the University of Munich, where
he had made application for the
continuance of his studies. Included
in here are French,
history of philosophy, political the-
ories, contemporary history, speech,
sociology, and general psychology.
Dieter’s father a professor of
Protestant Religion at the Wilhelm
School of Humanities. When asked
what he thought of Davidson Col-
lege, Dieter commented that it is
“a beautiful campus” with a
very friendly spirit” built upon “a
high scholastic level.”

Max Stolberg, sponsored by Beta
Theta Pi, is from Weiden, Bovaria.
He is including in his schedule of
studies French, political science,
economics 21-22, 31-32, and 81. His
in the trading
world, as shown by his choice of
subjects, might be explained by the
fact that his father runs a flour

Dr. Schenck Spends
Summer In Europe

Dr. L. B. Schenck, Professor of
Bible at Davidson, was chosen last
summer by the Carnegie Founda-
tion of New York City to travel
to Europe for a period of study
and research with some of the con-
tinent’s most
gians. The purpose of his trip was
the coordination of European and
American thinking on certain theo-
logical problems. His particular in-
terest in the research was the
doctrine of the child in the church
and in the Covenant of God. Dr.
Schenck well qualified on the
subject, for he is the author of a
book published by the Yale Press
in 1940 entitled ‘*Presbyterian Doc-
trine of Children in the Coven-
ant.” Interest in the book has evi-
dently not been confined only to
this country, for translations have
found their way into the hands of
European theologians and it is un-
derstood Schenck’s writings have
aroused considerable interest there.
The doctor made his trip to Eu-
rope with the idea of acting as a
liaison link between European and
American thinking on the subject.
The whole trip lasted about ten
weeks, and even if research work
and study did consume most of his
time, the doctor nevertheless was
able to find time for short pleasure
trips. He spent several week ends
high in the majestic Alps, and even
found time once to journey up into
Bavaria where he witnessed the
famous and spectacular Passion
Play at Oberammergau.

The doctor's trip, took in much
of Europe in a wide arc. He left
New York City aboard a Norwe-

prominent theolo-

is

gian ship and headed across the

Atlantic, through the Straits of
Gibraltar, to Genoa, Italy. ©
