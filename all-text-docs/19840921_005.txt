General Promotes ‘High Frontier’ Defense System

By DAVID McGEE

Lieutenant General Daniel O.
Graham, a retired three-star general,
spoke on campus Wednesday on what he
calls a “high frontier” defense system.
The system he has researched through his
company, High Frontier Inc., would
shoot down Intercontinental Ballistic
Missiles (ICBM) launched against the
United States.

“It is a proposition that we can use ad-
vanced U.S. technology to knock down
ICBMs,” Graham said. The concept, he
said, challenges the doctrine nuclear
strategists have held for over 20 years,
the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruc-
tion (MAD).

Graham denounced the doctrine,
calling it dangerous, provocative, and
displacing. “The nation has mandated
the vulnerability of its own people. The
only way the United States can survive a
nuclear exchange is if the U.S. and the
Soviets have the same capability to
slaughter each other and the horror of
that.”

Once an ICBM is launched, Graham
said, the only option is to retaliate,
“otherwise, there is nothing we can do,”
he said.

Graham said his proposed satellite-
based defense system would be deployed
by the space shuttle. Through advanced
targetting mechanisms, the system
would use non-nuclear missiles to des-
troy ICBMs. According to Graham, the
system would eliminate 95 percent of a
nuclear strike. “The remaining five per-
cent would not annihilate the U.S.,” he
said.

The current MAD strategy, Graham

said, “hurts the American conscience be-
cause it is based on how many Russians
we can slaughter. It is contrary to Ameri-
can ethics.”

The audience spent nearly an hour
questioning and challenging Graham’s
proposal. One student asked about the
system’s economic feasibility. Graham
said the U.S. could manufacture and de-
ploy the system for $30 billion in 10
years.

“You would get it free because you
would save money on things you
wouldn’t have to spend for,” he said.

“How much would you pay to sur-
vive?” Graham added that the system,
once deployed, would encourage arms
control and reduction.

The U.S. can deal with the Soviets in
three ways, Graham said. “One is to try
to jaw-bone them out of the missiles, or
increase Our Own weaponry, or deploy
high frontier — this is the proper an-
swer . . . It’s a proposition whose time
has come.”

Members of the audience challenged
Graham's projections extensively, par-
ticularly whether or not the U.S. could
sustain an attack of 5 percent of the
Soviet’s nuclear arsenal or whether the
Soviets would resort to conventional
forces in Europe as a result of a U.S. de-
fensive advantage, and whether or not
the possession of defensive capability
might encourage offensive use of nuclear
weapons.

Several students pointed out that
cruise -missiles, which travel along the
earth’s surface, could not be destroyed
from space. Graham said such weapons
would have to be dealt with in another

way; his system would counter mainly
ICBMs.

Graham conducted an opinion poll in
California that showed 82.3 percent of
those polled supported a space-based de-
fense system, while 17.7 percent op-
posed it. A national poll revealed similar
results.

The result of an informal poll among
the audience revealed about half favored
the system and half did not.

Graham’s talk was sponsored by the
College Republicans. Graham is a
graduate of West Point and the U.S.
Army War College, a former member of
the U.S. Security Council, former Direc-
tor of Military Intelligence, and former
second in command of the Central Intel-
ligence Agency. He is the author of two

sociology Department
To Seek Chairman

By TED WILSON

The Sociology and Anthropology de-
partment is searching for a new chairman
to replace Professor Robert Ruth, who
held the position for the past five years.
Ruth served a two-year term as acting
chairman prior to his full chairmanship
and is still a member of the department's
staff.

Vice-President of Academic Affairs
and Dean of Faculty T.C. Price Zimmer-
man now serves as acting chairman. ‘““We
have announced a search for an an-
thropologist to chair the department” be-
ginning next fall, he said.

He said the professor will “increase

the anthropology component in the de-
partment,” which now offers primarily
sociology courses. The addition of an-
thropology classes will make sociology
and anthropology ‘an extremely interest-
ing major,” he said. “The design of the
curriculum will be left up to the depart-
ment and the new chairman,” he added.

Although Zimmermann is not teach-
ing any sociology or anthropology
courses this year, the new department
head will instruct classes.

According to sociology Professor
Janet Grigsby, the chairmanship “is not a
position someone holds forever.” She
said the change has caused “no problems
with classes and registration.”
