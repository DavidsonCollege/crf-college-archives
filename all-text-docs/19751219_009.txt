Por lio.

They sat together in the room
Friends since birth.

Shared memories of childhood images

Wooden merry-go-round horses with no trails
Anise-seed cookies

And plots against the grown-ups.

In that dimly-lit past

Two children still exist.

Even now their laughter lingers on the beach
As they run and leap under the sky

Pretending to be strong and graceful horses
Arabians among the sand dunes.

Sometimes late at night

The grown-ups would build a fire on the sand.
Lighting smail sticks

The children would dance

Weaving fiery circles in the dark

Until only a red glow remained.

As they grew older

The wooden horse disappeared under winter coats.

And the plots against the grown-ups
Have subsided into an uneasy truce.
We are_only women on the beach now
No longer dappled stallions.

Harlequin

Came the night a mist dissolved the trees

And in the broken light colours fly, fading by

Pale and cold as figures fill the glade.

Gray is the web they spin, on and on, and on and on.
Through the flame still summer lingers on

Though her pictures soon shatter.

All, always the same,

But there appears in the shades of dawning,
Though your eyes are dim,

All of the pieces in the sky.

There was once a harvest in this land,

Reap from the turquoise sky, harlequin, harlequin,

Dancing round three children fill the glade

Theirs was the laughter in the winding stream and in between.
Close your door, the picture fades again,

From the flames in the firelight.

All, always the same,

But there appears in the shades of dawning,
Though your eyes are dim,

All of the pieces of the sky.

All, all is not lost,

And light appears in the shades of dawning
When your eyes can see,

Order. the pieces, put them back, put them back.
