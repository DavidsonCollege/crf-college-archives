“Andy Warhol’s ‘Frankenstein’ ’

Paul Morrissey has always done his best
work when. photographing the people he
knows about—the ‘‘eccentrics’’ of the New
York d-—and his worst work
when fantasying about the worlds these
“‘eccentrics’’. would like to enter--
Hollywood and the Italian film colony.

In other words, “Trash,’’ “Women in
Revolt,” and ‘‘L’Amour’’ are more in-
teresting than ‘‘Heat’’ and. ‘‘Andy
Warhol’s ‘Frankenstein’.’’ (I have not seen
“Flesh.’’)

In the first three films, the ‘‘eccentrics”’
often act out their fantasies for the camer-
as; in the last two, the films themselves
have become the fantasies.

‘‘Heat,’’ a ‘remake’ of

Boulevard,” takes place in Hollywood and

stars Sylvia Miles in the Gloria Swanson.

role.
' The film is only interesting around the
edges, where we can see Eric Emerson,
Andrea Feldman, and Pat Ast.

~~ Morrissey’s latest.and worst film, ‘‘An-
dy Warhol’s ‘Fr in’,”’ was filmed
in Italy and stars Monique Van Vooren,
Udo Kier, and the ever-uninteresting Hoe
Dallesandro.

Like Sylvia Miles, Van Vooren and Kier
lack talent for the type of improvisation
Morrissey’s movies thrive on, and
Dallesandro has never had any talent
whatsoever.

The best scene in the movie—practically
the only one that is any good at all-—
involves neither Van Vooren nor Kier and
does not require any ‘acting’ acting from
Dallesandro.

Letter To The Editor

“Sunset.

In this scene, the field hand_(Dallesan-
dro) takes his friend, the farmer (Srdjan
Zelenovic) to a brothel in order to in-.
troduce him to a more interesting life style
than the one he has chosen for himself—
monasticism. '

The farmer ignores the advances of the
whores and watches blankly as his friend
demonstrates what one does with such
women. Zelenovic gives a sleazy non-
performance, and the scene has a bit of the
energy that Morrissey’s campy brand of
humor has so much of when it comes fully
to life, as in parts of ‘‘Trash.” —

In its content, ‘‘Andy . Warhol’s
‘Frankenstein’ ” is not an attempt by
Morrisey to do something different; it is

simply a very weak and very poor exam-.

“Trash” is distinguished by wildly inept
photography and direction-the perfect
form for its content. One would think that
Morrissey had purposely done everything
wrong while making ‘“‘Trash,” but he has
protested in an interview that he was sim-
ply doing the best he could to make a com-

petent film. \

Since ‘‘Trash,’’ Morrisey has progressed
towards competency to the extent one can
tell he is trying. ‘‘Andy Warhol’s ‘Franken-
stein’,”” though really quite crude, is
meant to be elegant, and the results are
embarrassing.

Barbour Attacks Doares’ Criticism’

Of Gaige

To the Editor:

It was with great
amazement and disbelief that
I read the comments and
charges of Bob. Doares on the
Office of International
Education and Dr. Frederick
Gaige in the last issue of the
.73-’"74 DAVIDSONIAN.

The large majority of these
comments were not based on
the facts, and as a result they
were untrue. In addition, his
letter was written ‘at a time
when Dr. Gaige, to quote
Doares, “is moving on to
greater things. . i could
not possibly reply as this was
the last issue of THE DAVID-
SONIAN while he was at
Davidson.

Doares charges that the ap-
plications of the Marburg JYA

students were not mailed until
late in the year, even though
they had been given to the
OIE.

He says that no publicity
was sent out to students on the
JYA programs.

This is entirely false. Two
personal letters were sent out
to every Davidson student ad-
vertising the programs. Most
of these, I noted, ended up on
the floor of the P.O. What
more do you want than two
personal letters? R

He charges that travel
arrangements ‘‘were weeks
late of the promised date of
availability merely because
the OIE failed to type them up.
' Again, this is totally
erroneous. The airlines them-
selves did not know about
schedules and prices for the
summer until late in_ the

- s¢thool year. As soon as they

were available, they were

given to the JYA students:
Doares complains of lack of

information on Eurail:

of thing this department would

- handle.”

Ms. Snouse really said that

the OIE had no information
available, but would get it as
soon as possible, but in any
case was not responsible for
student vacation travel, which

is what.a Eurail pass would be’

used for.

Although there were delays
in some of the functions of the
OIE, it was not the bunch: of
babbling idiots Doares por-
trayed it to be. To the con-
trary, it was a very dedicated
and hard working professor
and staff trying to organize
one of the biggest messes in
the school.

It was Dr. Gaige’s first year
at a job in which he had little
experience and in which there
was no transition period from
the previous director. He took
it, though, bcause of his strong
beliefs in the value of foreign

Dees ccused the OIE of
a
“‘lackadaisicalness.’’ © This
charge is so poor it’s funny.
Not only was Dr. Gaige
Director of the OIE, but he
taught half time and was
chairman of the South Asia
department. He was director
of the Southern Atlantic States
Association for South Asian
Studies and served on a
notional task force on in-
ternational education.

» International. Education

He sponsored several sum-

mer institites in South Asia:

and African related studies. I
don’t wonder why the OIE
may not have been the most
efficient department in the
school. I wonder how it got
anything done at all.

Dr. Gaige was constantly in
his office until 9 of 10 at night
and on Saturdays and Sun-
days. Constantly. Show me
one other professor who works
those hours.

Doares names who he thinks
would make a good director
for the OIE, but says this is
impossible as this professor is
teaching a full load. Why is
this impossible. Dr. Gaige was
doing twice the normal
amount af work.

As a work study student un-
der him for two years, I
found Fred Gaige to be one of
the most dedicated people at
Davidson. He was interested
personally in the students

more than any other professor
Ihave known.
Davidson really _ lost

something when “‘he went on

to greater things.” res’

comments about him are both

professionally and personally
unwarranted and scurrilous.

the memories of summer ex-
cursions they so faithfully con-
ducted. My summer weighs
heavy on me this time around.

This was a summer of
travel. I broke an amazingly
provincial record and ven-
tured across the Great Water
to England. And now that body
and shoes are back, I am spen-
ding some time trying to reel
in a mind still swimming out
there somewhere.

I might as well unload the
struggle all right now, or it
will seep out for months to
come. Fellow house dwellers
have already taken to mut-
tering things like I’ll have to
pay more attention to denture
adhesive ads if I say ‘In
England. . .” one more time.
Murray and Mary even kindly
declined my surviving pound
note. :

England is how lost in a
glorious haze. People and
places loved too briefly have
been wrenched away. What
can one say to anyone who
wasn’t there? Secret
memories remain secret.

Perhaps a humorous com-
mentary. Let me tell you
about a botttle of wine and
Edinburgh Castle, or a park
bench in Stratford__

No. You-undoubtedly know.
all you care to know about
what Stonehenge looks like.
(Did you know that triple coi!s
of barbed wire give it the air of
a concentration camp?) How
to capture the powerless relief
when a President resigns at
two in the morning thousands
of miles away?

Thrown together in David-
son, we must wrestle with
summer memories alone, or
find a friendly ear that knows.
Then the body travelled; now
the mind has a chance to
hitch a ride onward.

Would anyone care to see a
picture or two, or a pair of old
shoes? : ay

My summer lies lost and
shining, somewhere over the,
rainbow. ea
