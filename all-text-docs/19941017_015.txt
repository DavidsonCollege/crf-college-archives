early November.

The Wildcats opened the
week’s games on Wednesday at
Wake Forest to play the host De-
mon Deacons. Wake Forest, who
was led by two goals from Ryan
Scott and scored three times in the
first 21 minutes, were able to de-
feat the Wildcats 3-1. The ‘Cats
goal came from Robert Clarke in
the 23rd minute.

The team was in‘action again
on Thursday, as they returned home
to face the Keydets of VMI incold,
rainy weather. The ‘Cats re-
bounded from Wednesday’s loss
in high fashion, as they got goals
from Phil Julien, Nick Troiano,
John Hudson, and Robert Clarke
en route to an easy 5-1 victory.
The ‘Cats scoring binge continued

Freshman Julien was a force, scor-
ing three goals and dishing out an
assist as well. Julien’s hat trick
was his first as a collegian, and the
first on the team this year. Keith
Kleeman and Fernando Campos
added the other goals, and senior
captain John Sampers gave outtwo
assists. Davidson played again in
the tournament on Sunday against
the nation’s second-ranked team,
North Carolina.

The Wildcats record now
stands at 4-1 in the Southern Con-
ference and 8-5-1 overall. The
team will have until Thursday to
recover from the strain of playing
four games in five days, as Georgia
Southern will come to Richardson
Field to face the Wildcats in their
last home game of the season.

Field hockey
goes 2-1 on
Louisville
weekend trip

By Richard Glenn

The Davidson field hockey
team travelled to Louisville. last
weekend for a three game tour. Oni
Saturday, the team played SW Mis-
souri, and unfortunately the ‘Cats
never got on their game. “We
started out playing defensively
rather than offensively and that
cost us the game,” said Jessica Roy
“98. Davidson fell behind 1-0, and
although they played agressively
in the second half, they couldn’t
find the back of the net. The refer-

ees also made several questionable

offsides calls on Davidson’s scor-
ing chances, making the 1-0 loss
all the more frustrating.

The ‘Cats were upset about
their loss on Saturday and came
out fired up on Sunday against
Bellarmine College. Davidson
scored early and playedconfidently
throughout the game and came
away with a solid 4-0 victory. An-
drea Short ‘95, Holly Kledis ‘96,
Nikki Ficeto ‘96, and Chase Kieth
“98 were responsible for Wildcat
goals. On Monday, the ‘Cats faced
the University of Louisville, where
they were intent on coming away
from the trip with a winning record.
Although the score was only 2-1,
Davidson dominated the game.
Erin Smith ‘98 scored first for the
‘Cats, and Kledis added a second
half goal to seal the victory for
Davidson. Crisp passing and all-
around teamwork allowed
Davidson to play one of their bet-
ter games of the year.

Monday’s win was important
to the team as they did not want the
eight hour bus ride to go for naught.
Davidson’s record now stands at
8-4, and they are at home four their
next four games, the first being
Appalachian State on October 19.
