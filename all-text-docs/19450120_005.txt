—was plenty good,
He made a good many difficult shots and his final score was
an even dozen points. Sokolblonde, No. 30, even beat him
a point. Phil got eleven for us, and looked good while
doing it.

Did you see Lowry get that big Guilford knocker ? I'll
say he did. And old Patterson broke one guy’s arm. | don’t
see how we took time to score 42 points and I just don’t
see how they scored 22. Those two Japs could dribble
pretty good, but they couldn’t hit that basket. We looked
plenty good, especially in the last half, when both teams
got kind of heated up.

Speaking of that last half, it looked something like Tues-
day morning’s P. “T. class, but still nobody threw a body
block like Dietrick did at me.

Wednesday night, Charlotte saw the entire basketball

Davidstin's Wildeats annexed
their third win of thes season, last
week by downing a spirited Guil
ford club in the Davidson Gym-
nasium Monday night.

Action started from the opening
toss-up and the first half saw David-

points to 1,

The two, Guilford drawing cards,
Japanese. Aikawa and Hirabayhshi
lived up to all pre-game informa- -
tion. They were a pair of fleet,
shifty, colorful guards.

In the second half, action was as
fast, scoring slower, and fouling
more frequent. With o minutes left
to go, the game got noticeably
tougher and many fouls were called.

With less than 4) minutes left,
Captain’ Lowry started sinking’ bas-
kets from all parts of the court.
Guilford retaliated with Hawarth
and Jaromello sinking baskets. Sub-
stitutions flocked in and helped sell

the score to 42-22,
