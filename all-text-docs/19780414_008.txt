The New Price is Right

Our Veep Academic, named Price,

Said, “A strict three-course load will be nice.”
But the students cried, “Hell!”

“Won't two do as well?”

Praise Yahweh! He took their advice!

—Tom Bessellieu

Lorenzaccio

Il était une fois un gorille

Qui ne détestait pas les.jeunes filles
Mais les vrais champignens
Etaient encore “plus bons”

Donc il preférait manger des morilles.

Said a thirsty young playwright named Shakespeare,
“’'m afraid I’ve not got what it takes here;

rll step in this bar—lo!

There’s good‘old Kit Marlowe;

rll get him to stand me some Jake’s beer!”

—Ben Jonson
( contributed by Charles Lloyd)

To tempt me toward limericks is mean
for | find my mind in-between
Obscene is uncouth
but truth remains truth
| know less than one that is clean.

—Herb Jackson
