editorial

Ernest Beatty was not only
an effective teacher at Davidson;
he was also the source of a good
many fresh and sparkling —
sometimes startling — ideas.
(The two, it is hoped, are not
mutually exclusive.) After
working through a couple of
decades of students, many of
whom seemed to him to have
little interest in getting an edu-
cation, Beatty proposed that di-
-plomas be presented to students
at matriculation; those who
wanted only a diploma would
take it and leave. The others,
who were committed to the busi-
ness of getting an education,
would set themselves to four
years of serious work without
the distraction of those of lesser
purpose.

It’s an idea worth thinking
about.

quently or with greater empha-

years offer a once-in-a-lifetime

recalled or reclaimed years later
by sincere regrets.

What is the sense in paying
the high costs of a college edu-
cation in money and time while
seeming to do everything pos-
sible to avoid the opportunities
to use the incomparable re-
sources which will never again
or to the same extent be so con-
veniently available?

Most students will never
again have acomparable library
and staff with all that they have
to offer. Or a sports program,
with coaches and trainers and
facilities and the opportunity to
learn and develop athletic skills
for a lifetime of use and enrich-
ment. Many will never again
have such an exposure to our
opportunity for close-up asso-
ciation with the fine arts. The
list goes on and it is an impres-
sive one. Look around and make
your own list.

As The Davidsonian entered

its second decade of publication,

the college itself was in the midst
of anew era. Students were caught
between traditional values, such as
those behind the Prohibition move-
ment, and the wild lifestyle of the
Roaring Twenties. Though many
students today face similar deci-
sions, they live in an environment
which differs greatly from that of
70 years ago.

The Davidsonian covered
most of the hundreds of speakers
that came to Davidson trying to

- both educate and influence the stu-

dent body.

In 1925, one speaker gave an
enlightening lecture on “Social Hy-
giene” which gave “students a bet-
ter idea and a clearer conception of
the fundamentals of animal repro-
duction,” then proceeded to ask
the boys to consider the once-ab-
surd notion that the opinions of
their “sweethearts and wives”
should be ‘valued.

Conservative speakers also
frequented the campus. A speaker
who visited in 1928 stated that
“Jesus is the solution to the prob-
lems of the college.” In 1931, Dr.
Ira Landith came to speak in favor
of Prohibition, raging against the
“wets” who were bringing America
to its knees. He decreed that “‘le-
galized liquor traffic must disap-
pear from God’s earth if this is to
be God’s earth.” i

_He went on to warn that the
“unclean life” of college ‘students
would not be forgiven, and’ would
certainly hinder their future
progress. Dr. Landith then went
on to declare that the 18th amend-
ment would never be repealed, even
in the lives of “generations un-
born.” Congress repealed the
amendment in 1933.

Since the students lived under
Prohibition, and the penalty for
violation of the alcohol policy was

expulsion, social functions were
rather tame compared to those of
today. Second-year students
waited anxiously for the “biggest
event of their Sophomore year, the

catchphrase of the time was
“Screen Shebas prefer College
Sheiks,” and movies often glori-
fied “baggy trousered campus
sheiks.” Sr

The survey found that [the ideal] girl
would need to be able to cook, sew,
and keep house. It was also a
priority that the Ideal Girl have the
ability to clog and square dance.
Though she would not drink alcoholic
liquor in any form, she would be glad

"pet” and "neck.”

Soph Banquet,” which consisted
of dinner in Charlotte and a visit to
one of the city’s theatres to “enjoy
an hour of entertainment.” The
fervent anticipation of this event
doubled in 1931, when, in a de-
lirium of liberalism, the adminis-
tration decided to allow girls to
accompany the students.

The topic of girls held top
priority in the minds of most
Davidson students. In 1926, The
Davidsonian took a survey that
tried ‘to describe the Ideal Girl:
The survey found that this girl
would need to be able tocook, sew,
and keep house. It was also a
priority that the Ideal Girl have the

ability to.clog.and.sqiiare dance.
Though she would not drink alco-

holic liquor in any form, she would
be glad to “pet” and “neck.”
One rather risque joke that

‘slipped past the editors and ap-

peared in the joke section of The
Davidsonian read, “Is there an art
in kissing?—The only are is “Art

~ thou willing.’” Such reckless hu-

mor probably stemmed from the
influence of Hollywood, for a

The ads in The Davidsonian
might have also influenced the stu-
dents of the twenties and thirties.
Cigarette ads took up half-pages
and urged students to “have-a
Camel,” for they “never leave a
cigarettey aftertaste.” Perhaps con-

cerned about truth in advertising,
Camel also ran ads with the catchy
slogan, “Just quit Camels if -you
can.” Other tobacco companies

piyed up the soothing quality is

tar. “Your throat protection-agai

irritation-against cough... ORS me
a Lucky Strike every time.”

Insurance companies also tried
to take advantage of college stu-
dents. A 1929 ad hawking Aircraft
Property Damage Insurance
warned, ““You may be able to look
out for the falling airplane, but
your home or place of business
cannot look out for itself.”

Davidson students of the twen-
ties and thirties faced many chal-
lenges, most of all living in fear of
falling airplanes. They were
thrown into the whirlwind of the
Roaring Twenties, then suddenly
had to face the Depression.

With the tutelage of brilliant
speakers and the watchful eye of
the tobacco companies looking
over them, they managed to over-
come their naivety and look to the
future.
