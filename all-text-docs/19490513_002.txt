1. The largest amount ever contributed

for the Christmas Gift Fund was contributed

this year. This includes average per student.

2. Largest attendance for the Spring and
Fall Services in recent years. This was due
largely to the informal nature that the YMCA
inaugurated this year.

- 3. No outstanding debt left for the new

It should be mentioned here that the offer-

cautiously to the roof of a neigh-

That particular fraternity has since

The Class of ’49 at the U. of

a class gift. Instead of donating
something of use to the campus,
they are burying a century crypt
to be opened by the Class of 2049.
The crypt will contain copies of
the various campus publications
along with other items pertinent
to the interest of students a hund-
red years from now.

A SENIOR REMINiSCES

BY BILL BROWNSON

There is always the danger, in
writing one’s reminiscences, of
lapsing into sentimentality, and
gazing wistfully into a past which
now assumes a rosy hue in the
light of a rather commonplace
present and an uncertain future.
And yet to think back over a full
and happy college experience with
out a trace of sentiment or en-
thusiasm is impossible for one
whose stay here has been at all
meaningful. These, then, are the
thoughts of one to whom Davidson
has meant a great deal. However
expressed, they are sincere, If
inappropriate, or ill advised, may
they be excused as those of one
who is genuinely proud to be a
Davidson man,

As the senior looks beyond gra.

duation to new duties and new
tesponsibilities, there is often a
faint, nostalgic yearning for the

days when life was not quite so
serious, or so complex, as now it
seems. The outlook for the fu-
ture is bright, to be sure, but few
of us can break the ties formed
in four rich years without a lin-
gering backward look, and a sense
of mild sorrow at their passing.
For those to whom college was
merely a burdensome necessity,
and commencement a welcome es-
cape, there may be no such feel-
ing. Perhaps for those who sought
only a diploma from their Alma
Mater, and begrudged the years
they gave, leaving her behind will
not be difficult. But to the degree
that we have loved Davidson, and
become a part of her, our separa-
tion from her life will be painful.

And yet there’ is a sweetness
mingled with that pain, cherished
things are never really lost, but
remain with us in memory, growing
dearer with the passage of time.
All of us have our college memor-
ies. They are vague and formless
now, perhaps, obscured, and right-
ly so, by our plans and dreams for
the days ahead. But when view-
ed in the calm, sure perspective
of later years, these happy reminis-
cences are numbered among our
most precious possessions. And
sO, as we seek to express those
memories, may ,we be delivered
from a shallow, conventional sen-
timentality, and realize with a
warmth of appreciation their en-
during worth,

In recalling to mind our life at

Davidson, the question inevitably
arises as to just what our college
career has meant to us. What

are those qualities and influences

‘that have made our -college what

it is, and have had a real bear-
ing upon our lives? As we prepare
to leave these halls for the last
time as a student; soon to be iden.
tified with the busy rush of modern
life, it seems fitting to pause
briefly, and to make a thoughtful
appraisal of the true values in our
undergraduate life.

It is trite, perhaps, but true
nevertheless, that a college (or any
institution) derives its quality from
the caliber of the men who com-
prise its membership. To put it
simply, Davidson is a fine school
because fine men have made it that

way. The fellowship and friend-
ship of such men will surely be
one of the memories which we

shall treasure most highly in the
days to come.

We haven't enjoyed all of our
courses, nor have we always been
stimulated by our professors, but
the rather tedious process of learn-
ing has been, in the long run, a
gratifying one. Our athletic teams
were not always the very best, but
the men who represented David-
son were respected for the way
they played, and we were never
ashamed to wear the red and black
We griped and complained, and
were dissatisfied at times, it seem-
ed, with everything. We criticized
and disparaged some of the tradi-
tions and policies of our college,
but we loved her just the sami,
and were proud to be her sons.
It was hard to return to the campus
after a big weekend, and we never

fully realized}_then, the great pri-
vilege that was ours. {n chapel
we let off steam together, we

laughed together, we sang together,
and we prayed together. We suf-
fered through the same exam
periods. We gathered in front of
Georgia, or in the stud, or almost
anywhere to shoot the bull with
the fellows. There was always
something to do, and never the
time to do it.

Davidson, to me, is a wonder-
ful place. It’s that way because
the faculty and the students are

wholesome, friendly people, and
because here are provided the
means and the atmosphere for

building character, and developing
every side of a man’s nature. And
above all else, it’s wonderful : be-
cause Jesus Christ is here. David-
son is different, and He makes
the difference,

Political An gles

WAGNER, TAFT “HARTLEY, ae WOOD‘
(BY HENRY HANSEN)

Truman had a somewhat dubious
mandate from the people, but un-
fortunately they were not so con-
siderate as to give him even that
wispy sort of an assurance as far
as his program was and is con-
cerned. He got elected by going
out and giving them hell, but be-
ing elected and instituting a lot
of “catch what voter you can”
campaign promises are, as Presi-
dent Truman has discovered, two
distinct things. And the second
does not necessarily follow the first.

Truman vowed that he would
put into effect each and every one
of his campaign promises and did
so with a benign assurance which,
at the very least, could not be call-

ed politically astute. Programs,
Particularly large and. sweeping

ones, are seldom: easy to put in,
even when a president has a favor-
able Congress, and Truman has
found certain difficulties in this
matter with particular reference to
a strange coalition which has
sprung up between certain oddly
assorted political bed fellows —
namely the Dixiecrat and certain
Republican groups. Ms

President Truman’s first major
hitch might be said to be the de-
bacle concerning the Walgren ap-
pointment. Many hoped that
Senator Byrd, in spité of being
a long-time Democrat, would un-
tie the tie which existed and de.
feat .the nomination. of Walgren
for chief post of the NSRB. When
his much hoped for event actual-
ly happened, it opened new and
distinctly pleasant vistas to Dixie-
crat and Republican both and
pointed the way to further co-oper-
ation in spoking the wheels of
President Truman's little red wag-
on.

Recently the ‘forces of labor

and capital began to assemble on

Capitol Hill for the coming battle
of the Taft-Hartley—Wagner pro-
tagonists. So far the squabbling
over these two billazand their new-
er forms, the Lesinski and Wood
Bills, ‘thas disappointed no one ex-
Cept an embarassed Truman and
an angry labor group who are an-
grily questioning the man from
Missouri as to the whys and where-
fores of the hitch which has been

met. aT
As yet, the situation resolves
itself into still more’ unresolved

chaos, but out of this a clear les-
son presents itself to those who
would be politically active. Don't
count your campaigns before they
are passed, for, as President Tru-
man has found,out, there’s many
a slip twixt “givin ’em hell’ and
giving them the complete program
in the form of “passed legislation.

While this fiasco is all highly
amusing to those who dislike Tru-
man, it is to be hoped that a bill
will yet. emerge which will pur-
sue a more middle of the road
policy since the present Lesinski
and Wood Bilis are simply refur-
bished editions of the old Wagner
and Taft-Hartley legislations and
are no different in aims or means,
Practically speaking, from their
earlier predecessors. If we ever
hope to stop this endless’ see-saw-
ing between an advantage first for
labor, then for ‘capital and man-
agement, and then back again, we
Must pass a piece ‘of legislation
which will represent the ‘honest
and objective efforts of both groups
to be fair to all concerned. Any
bill arising from violent partisan
viewpoint can only lead the way,
eventually, to a determined effort
by the opposition to pass a bill
equally propitious to the horses _
grazing on their own side of the
fence. j
