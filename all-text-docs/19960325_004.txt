Keg decision
enters final stages

By NaresH NAGELLA
Assistant News Editor

The decision on whether or
not to ban kegs is entering its final
stages this month. A sub-commit-
tee formed by Dean Shandley will
forward a final proposal on how
the ban would take place. Next, the
Council on Campus and Religious
Life will vote on the merits of that
proposal April 4.

The SGA has also formed an
ad-hoc committee to gather more
student feedback on the issue,
formed by eight SGA senators,
Buford, and seven students.

The CCRL decision then goes
to President Kuykendall. He can
either pass it on to the Trustees or
veto it. The Trustee vote should

take place in the middle of April. .

“That is why we want to hear

about student ideas and concerns
(regarding the ban),” says Senior
Peter Varney, member of CCRL.

He says, “I feel many people

are not happy about it (the ban). -

Students can be assured the CCRL
will give all ideas and concerns a
lot of thought. We want to be as
open as we can to different possi-
bilities.”

CCRL. member _ Ellen
Rockwell says that “even though
we have not been given the specif-
ics [of the proposal], we should
find a way to keep kegs here.We
do understand the difficulties [in
doing so}. One of our main priori-
ties is making sure the parties stay

open.”

Dean Shandley is skeptical.
“It’s just not worth the risk,” he
says of kegs remaining legal on

campus.

IN THE HABIT

Professor Homer Sutton and Ben Kinnaman discuss Habitat plans
during the faculty/staff retreat .

With only $3,000 left to goto
meet their fundraising goal, Wild-
cat Habitat volunteers took to the
phones over the weekend in order
to seek more donations. Until
March 28 they will be calling stu-
dents, faculty and staff who have
not yet given to the project. The
Habitat committee hopes to raise
enough money to meet their
$30,000 goal through the phone-
a-thon. “We’re really excited
we’ ve made it this far, and we’re
looking forward to meeting or
even surpassing our goal,” said
fundraising committee member
Amy Hawfield.
~ Donors will be able to pay
with check, Mastercard or Visa.

If anyone wishes to help out with
the phone-a-thon, please call Kim
Hauch (-6546) for more informa-
tion.

Wildcat Habitat has been
working on acquiring in-kind do-
nations from companies and indi-
viduals. A committee, headed by
Dr. John Wertheimer, will be con-
tacting local businesses and solic-
iting donations. If you know some-
one connected to the construction
business, please contact
Wertheimer (-2582) with that in-
formation.

Construction at the site has
been going very well. The footing,
which is a trench filled with con-
crete, has been put in and covered

with a cinder block. The frame
will be put up next week, weather
permitting. A trailer will be placed
on site for the storing of tools and
equipment to keep them out of the
weather.

Katherine Cooke of the vol-
unteer committee has sent out
forms to various campus groups
for them to choose a day in which
to volunteer. It will be a good
opportunity for groups on cam-
pus to volunteer for a worthy cause
and will help to unite the campus
as a whole. If your group would
like to pick a day — or several —
on which to come out and volun-
teer, please call Katherine Cooke

Independents and Houses raise
money in annual SGA phonathon

By Beto BAcon
Staff Writer

From Sunday to Thursday, stu-
dents, faculty, and local class chairs
raised $91,513 in the annual SGA/
Annual Fund Phonathon held in
Chambers Gallery from 6-9 each
night.

Director of the Annual Fund
Lanier Brown, Class of ’82, says,
“This was one of the best
phonathons in my recent memo-
ries. We had more students in-
volved than ever before. There
was a great turnout from all the
different houses.”

SGA president and phonathon
chair Warren Buford says, “The
phonathon was a remarkable suc-
cess. It brought students together,
and it raised a lot of money for
things that are needed for the stu-
dents.”

The overall goal of the An-

nual Fund is to raise $4 million,
with 55% participation, to support
tuition costs and to keep Davidson
running on a daily basis. Without
this money, Davidson would be
running on 90% capacity. All
Patterson Court Houses, freshmen,
and independents partcipate in the
calling. Rusk House collected the
most money.

Senior Catherine Thompson,
aphonathon chair, says, “[The stu-
dents] had a lot of morale. It’s alot
of fun todo. We had a really good
time calling people; giving out
prizes, and raising money for the
school. Everything went really
smoothly this year.” Other
phonathon chairs included Katie
Finch, Rosie Molinary, and Lucy
Sherman.

Assistant Director to the An-
nual Fund Allison Wright,
Davidson College class of ‘94,
says, “Not only is the SGA

¢

Phonathon crucial in that it helps
the Annual Fund raise the dollars
necessary to keep Davidson run-
ning, it also serves an important
PR purpose. The student
phonathon is one of the best ways
for alumni to remain in contact
with Davidson.”

Brown echoes Wright’s
thoughts: “It’s nice for the alumni
to hear from the students, because
they are reminded that Davidson is
still the same great place.”

“Its success can be contrib-
uted to fantastic leadership of all
night chairman, all house repre-
sentatives, and the hard work put
into the phonathon by Rosie, Katie,
Lucy, Catherine, and Warren,”
adds Wright.

Buford says, “I’d especially
like to thank Allison Wright who
organized and worked well with
the students. I’m very, very
pleased.”

Self-Study

from page 1

Still, as the Self-Study indi-
cates, the gay experience at
Davidson is far from ideal.

FLAG president, sophomore
Robert Knight says, “I’ ve had some
problems with acouple of guys my

freshman year as well as with a
campus religious organization, but
I do think the environment is im-
proving [for gay students].”

Knight adds, “I doubt most of
the recommendations [in the study]
will be implemented. But, itis good
that efforts towards improvement
are being discussed. What would
really help is attracting more gay
and lesbian students to campus.”

The Self-Study says it is im-
possible to guess the amount of
students that are gay.

The study can only estimate it
is somewhere between 1% and 10%
of the student population. Efforts
to specifically recruit such students
are not allowed due to federal dis-
crimination laws the college fol-
lows.

According to Dean Shandley,
“The college can still try its hard-
est to create an environment ac-
commodating and incorporating all
and any individuals. The sugges-
tions made in the self study will
lead us in the right direction.”
