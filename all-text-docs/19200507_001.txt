Fresh-Soph Debate Won

y Eu’s

R. Bitzer and L. J. Bray Win Medals
in Interesting Contest

All of those that heard the Fresh-
Soph debate last Thursday night ad-
mit that it was one of the best ever
staged at Davidson.

The query for the debate was,
Resolved, that the United States
should adopt some policy of com-
pulsory universal military training.

The Phis, holding the affirmative,
were represented by Bray, Mc-
Geachy and Burney. The Eus, hav-
ing the negative, were represented
by Cooper, Bitzer and Houghton.

Bray, first up, was very fluent in
his speech and gave some good
thoughts. His debate centered on
the following points: First, the
United States is in need of some
kind of national defense. Second,
universal military training is eco-
nomically a sound policy. Third, it
is democratic. America owes it to
the soldier to have this policy.

Cooper, first up for the negative,
had plenty of “pep” and enthusiasm.
His argument was based on two
main points: First, from on eco-
nomic standpoint. Second, from a
psychological standpoint. Cooper
endeavored to show that the navy
was the first line of defense and that
America needed it more than com-
pulsory military training. He show-
ed that there would be no danger of
invasion through Canada, Mexico or
the Pacific. Cooper emphasized the
fact that w needed real trained and
skillful men.

McGeachy, second speaker on the
affirmative, practically confirmed
Bray’s argument. First, it is eco-
nomically a sound policy. and sec-
ond, it 1s democratic. e showed
that our standing army’s expenses
would be dropped and that we would
secure more labor on the farm.

Bitzer, second speaker for the
negative, gave as his three argu-
ments: First, the great cost of uni-
versal training. Second, the im-
moral atmosphere around our
camps, and third, food production
would be decreased.

Burney, the last speaker for the
affirmative, added to McGeachy’s ar-
gument, the benefits derived from
universal military training, which
were: First, physical; second, men-
tal; third, social, and fourth, civil.
Love for country comes through
rendered service.

Wildcats Lose Three and Win
One---P. C. Trounced Severely

P. C. vs. Davidson.

The Wildcat nine, playing in its
true form, won from Presbyterian
College of South Carolina by a score
of 11 to 2. The Davidson lads play-
ed errorless ball all through the
game and put up one of the best ex-
hibitions of baseball that was ever
seen at Clinton, where they played.

As to clouting the apple these boys H

were there with the goods, amass-
ing 12 hits during the game, said
hits being gootl for 11 runs. The
itcher who started out for the
luestockings fared badly and was
jerked in favor of Hope, who al-
lowed Davidson three hits.

Currie, for Davidson, was erratic
but in the pinches he showed his
quality and let his opponents’ down
easy. He also hit well, getting two
bingles out of four times up.

The Red and Black machine tal-
lied in the third and fifth, seventh,
and ninth innings. Until the seventh
inning only two runs had crossed
the platter for Davidson and two
for P. C., but in the lucky seventh
six more came across and those
runs put the game on ice. In the
ninth three more runs were added
to our total.

Georgia Tech vs. Davidson
First

Georgia Tech triumphed over Da-
vidson in the first of the games play-
ed in Atlanta, 6 to 2. Until the
eighth inning Davidson was in the
lead, but after a circuit clout by
Turner, Tech’s third-sacker, and
several singles, the long end of the
score was the other way. Both
teams played a good class of hall
and except for the eighth there was
nothing spectacular.

Shepard pitched a good game for
the Wildcats and except fur one bad
inning in which his support was
weak had the Engineers under his
control. Murphy, on the mound
for Tech, pitched a good game, al-
lowing five hits and two runs.

Class of 1915 to Hold

First Reunion

Class President Urges all Members to
be Present~-Big Times Planned

For The Davidsonian
Dear Fellows of 1915:

We are five year old alumni! So
this year’s commencement will be
the time and the old campus the

lace for our first class reunion.

any have already been writing to
each other about this epochal event
in our alumni history and are plan-
ning without fail to pack up their
kitbags and go smiling to Davidson
that last week in May. And every
member of old °15 will want to be
there. We want to grip hands
again, renew the friendships and
joys of our years together, find out
how much older and wiser and rich-
er and finer the other fellow has
grown in five years’ time; show the
Davidson of today what the spirit
of 1915 was and still is, and pledge
anew our loyalty to The Greater
Davidson. e

Are you in business? Are you
studying? Are you teaching? Are
you preaching? Are you married?
Never mind. If Davidson fires ever
burned in your soul, you will want
to mark May 23-26 on your calen-
dar and plan to be on the Hill for
all or part of this time.

Plans are already being made for
the reunion. Write your ideas and
suggestions and whether you can
attend, to J. C. Harper, who is serv-
‘ing as chairman of the Reunion
Committee. His address is 159 W.
73rd street, New York City. Look
for a letter in The Davidsonian each
week as to further plans and the list
of the men who are coming. .

1915 made her mark in Davidson
history when in college. In five
years men of 1915 have been making
records of service everywhere. Let
us make our first reunion the big-
gest, most interesting, most enjoy-
able, most inspiring, class reunion
ever held at D. C.

Plan to come. Bring your wife,
your kiddies, your girl, or just your-
self. But come. Write a card to
Harper today.

Yours for D.C. ‘15,
FRANK W. PRICE,
Alumni President.
