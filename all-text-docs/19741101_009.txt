game we came closer to
playing as we should;in parts,
we did fairly well..The fact

- that we were always in the
game made a difference,’
said Farrell.

“I was especially happy
with the team’s performance
under pressure. This is essen-

* said.
The Wildcats had plenty of.
pressure to perform under in
the/fourth quarter. With 4:32
left in the game, Davidson,
trailing 16-10, had to puht from
4ts own 20.

But Hampden-Sydney fum-
bled two plays later, and Wild-
cat quarterback Dave Harper
assumed control as_ he
engineered what was to be the
winning drive.

Emotions in the game
reached a high point when the
march stalled just inside
Tiger territory.- At the Hamp-
den-Sydney 44, with fourth
down and eight, Harper threw
‘to split end Gary Pomeroy for
nine yards.

Pomeroy caught the ball in
mid-air, beyond the down
marker, and he was hit im-
mediately while still in the air.

The tackle drove him back
past the marker, and
Pomeroy fumbled the ball.

Farrell stated that the um-
pire who made the con-
troversial first down call
relied on his own judgement.

“He was standing right at
the down marker looking at
the’spot where the reception
was made. He made the call
immediately, and he didn’t
seem to see the fumble,”
Farrell explained,

“The question was one of
whether Pomeroy had control
of the ball when he was hit and
where his forward motion was
stopped, not whether he fum-
bled,”’ he continued. Farrell
added that the game film
doesn’t clarify the question.

Farrell said that he was
especially pleased with the
caliber of ball played by the
Wildcats in the first half. He
credited this as being the
reason for the 10-0 lead he en-
joyed at halftime.

“Throughout the first half
we played consistent, good
football. We had steady drives

_ that set up Duncan’s field goal

and Harper’s scoring run.

“Sustaining good drives like
this and stopping the op-
ponents’ drives are the marks
of a good team, and these have
been major problems in our
previous games,”’ Farrell

required 12 plays. Harper ran

four yards to cap an 80 yard

march that took only eight
plays, one of which was a 15

yard run by Hardaway and

another a bomb to Pomeroy.

Farrell was displeased with
the inability of the Wildcats to
maintain momentum once it
was established. (Hampden-
Sydney scored 13 points in the
third .quarter on two touch-
downs, failing to get a two-
point conversion after the first~
score.)

“We had momentum in the
first quarter, in fact during
the first half, and we didn’t
capitalize on it. We could have
won the game going away, but
we let the chances slip away.

“But we did get the momen-
tum back and played well in
the clutch,” Farrell noted. ‘‘I
feel we need to work on
keeping\a high standard of
consisten playing. We have to
learn to p at any .op-
vonamties handed us,’’ he ad-

“We need to develop the
killer instinct,’’ Farrell con-
