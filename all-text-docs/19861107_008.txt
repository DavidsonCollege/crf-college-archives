Fishing is the

By MIKE ADAMS
Baseball is the world’s greatest sport.
That's established fact. But even the best
things must come to an end eventually
and so it is with this year’s baseball sea-
son. And that is why I’m writing about
fishing — yes, that’s what I said, fishing.
Now some of you may claim that

fishing is a pastime, not a sport. And not

just a pastime, but a particularly dreary
and nasty one practiced mainly by old fat
men who love to chew Redman and call
one another Bubba.

- | beg to differ. This is the sports sec-
tion. I am the sports editor. Sports editors
write about sports in the sports section.
I’m writing about fishing. Therefore,
fishing must be a sport. And not just a
sport, but one practiced by some of the
more powerful intellects of our century.

’ William Butler Yeats was a fisherman.
Ernest Hemingway loved to fish. The list
goes on anon... andI would continue
it if | could think of anyone else.

There are many different kinds of
fishing. There’s deep sea fishing, surf

fishing, fly-fishing, fresh-water fishing,
live-bait fishing, lure fishing and many
others. Jonah liked live-bait fishing and
he had a unique idea about what could be
used as bait.

"I prefer to fish with artificial lures,
specifically plastic worms. I live in rural
Durham County, NC, and have a five-
acre farm pond just a quarter mile behind
my house where I often fish for bass and
bream.

Every fisherman’s goal is to catch a
really big fish, preferably bigger than any
fish anyone else he is with catches. Or, at
least that is the goal of every fisherman
with a type.A personality like myself. I
have never caught a really big fish. (I
hear you groaning to yourself now, “Oh
no, he’s going to tell a story about the big
one that got away.” Damn right, Iam. No
fishing article would be complete without
a good fish story. Back to the tale.)

Oh, I know there are big fish in my
pond. | have caught bass there myself
that weigh about four pounds, and on one

day I have seen two giant bass caught

- there. One weighed close to eight pounds

and the other close to. ten. —

I have come close to catching one of
these monsters only once in my fishing
career. That occasion was in the summer
of my twenty-first year, on a cool Satur-

' day morning which kept the mists circl-

ing gently across the surface of the water.
I let my mind drift, enthralled by the
beauty of the pristine scene .. . when
suddenly I felt something jerk the hell out
of my line! (I bet you’re glad I don’t re-
ally write like that.)

Well, anyway, I\got a bite from this
really big fish. I gave hiri plenty of slack
because my line was very brittle and
would snap easily if put under too much
tension. I played with the fish until he
was tired and turned towards the bank.
Then I began to reel in the slack, always
being careful not to put to much pressure
on my line. ¢

I succeeded in getting the fish to the
bank. He was a monster, probably

real sportof champions

weighing eight or nine pounds. Honest.
As I said, I had the fish to the bank,
but I did not have him out of the water
yet. This was a real dilemma. My line
was much too brittle to pick him up with,
and I did not have a net to.scoop him out.

. So there I was, two feet from what would

be the biggest fish I had ever caught and I
couldn’t get him out of the water. ©
Finally, I decided that I would pick
him up out of the water with my hand.
Ever so cautiously, I bent down and
eased my hand towards him until my fin-
gers just touched the water. Just then, the
sun broke through the clouds, causing my
hand to cast a shadow on the water. The
shadow startled the fish; he thrashed
about, broke my line and swam away.

There is a moral to this story some-
where. Its a moral that all fishermen
know, although they may express it in
different ways. I say; “The Lord giveth,
and the Lord taketh away.” What I’d like
to know is, why doesn’t he ever take
away the puny ones?

IMAC mixed double tourney yields drama

By MARK CROWTHER AND
BOB SHERRILL

Seniors Kris Nelson and Car-
ter Grine came from behind to de-
feat junior Tyler Stone and sopho-
more Kim Mullis 6-3, 4-6, 7-5
and to win the IMAC mixed dou-
bles championship.

Nelson’s consistant play ena-
bled them to come back from a 1-4
deficit and win the final five
games of the third set. Both teams
played superbly through: the two
hour and fifteen minute match:

Each suffered setbacks and had to

‘fight back to stay in the match.

Neither team. was unfamiliar
with close matches, however.
Nelson and Grine reached the fi-
nals after a series of tough
matches. They had a three set

match earlier in which they beat
sophomores Mike Friedlander and

Blanche Quinn.

Stone and Mullis also had a
rocky road to the semifinals. They
came from behind in the quarterfi-
nals to defeat Charlie Summers

and senior Laeta Kaligridis in
three sets.

Grine and Nelson reached the
finals by defeating juniors Craig
Mattison and Kristin Malone in a
tough battle, 7-5, 7-5. It was defi-
nately a team win in which Grine
and Nelson displayed both power
and consistancy in the grueling
two hour match that was played
last Sunday afternoon.

Malone, ‘who played varsity
tennis last year, had to keep her

partner in line in the first set. Mat-

tison began the match with a.
wooden racket and then finished

with a borrowed racket after he .
‘threw his own racket over the

fence. Once he settled down he
played superbly in the second set.

Grine, who once again donned

‘his black Chucks, played aggres-

sively and ‘successfully. Nelson
was serving at 4-5 in the second
set and faced two match points.
She fought them both off and held
her serve. Mattison and Malone,
who had rallied back from 1-4,

proceeded to lose the final two
games.

In the other semifinal match,
Stone and Mullis scrapped by
sophomores Charles Abney and
Elizabeth Franklin in a match that
included two close breakers 7-6,
3-6, 7-6. The difference was made
by the strong, serving of Stone and .
Mullis. At times they were incon-
sistant, but during the crucial
junctions of the match, time and
time again, Stone and Mullis
came up with big final serves to

_ Set up the point.
