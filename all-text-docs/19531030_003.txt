THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE THREE

Cross Country Runners
Meet Generals, Keydets

Coach Pete Whittle’s Harriers will meet V.M.I. and
Washington and Lee in a triangular cross country meet to-
morrow at Lexington, Va., in what may prove to be one of
the top meets in the Southern Conference this year.

This meet will be an important
test as to what can be expected
from the locals in the Southern
Conference meet two weeks off.
Both Washington and Lee and
V.M.I. have strong teams and sport
good conference records.

Davidson defeated Washington
and Lee in their only win last
year. Washington and Lee is
greatly improved over last year's
team, and has been a big surprise.
They've defeated Richmond, Wil-
liam and Mary, and V.P.L, while
losing to West Virginia and Bridge-
water.

VMI Strong

N.MLI. downed the Cats last year
and will be out to do the same
this year. V.M.I. is well balanced,
and has just tasted defeat once
to strong West Virginia.
week they were second behind the
Quantico Marines in the Virginia
A.A.U. meet.

If the Cats take this meet, they
could easily cop the Southern Con-
ference dual meet championship.
They have defeated Richmond and

William end Mary in the confer-|

ence this year, and if they take
W. and L., and V.M.L, it will leave
them with a clean conference slate.
Sperks Leads

Captain Homer Sparks is sched-
uled to lead the Cats tomorrow.
Sparks has proved to be a con-
sistent winner this year, and will
be one of the favorites in the Con-
ference and state meets. Along

Last.

with Sparks will be Feeney, Tur-
ner, and Lovette. Lovette turned
in his best showing of the year
last week against W. and M., and
State.

Herschel Allen, John Handley,
Archie Joyner, and Paul Alex-
ander make up the remainder of
the team. Each of these has been
working hard, and the outcome of
tomorrow's meet could easily be
determined by their showing.

State Shows Power

The Harrier’s continued in their
winning ways last week as they
defeated W and M., but lost to
N. C. State, one of the top teams
in the country, in a triangular
meet. Sawyer led the strong State
team and turned in one of his
best showings of the year. Sparks
was first for the Cats, but finished
fifth in the meet behind four
State runners.

Following tomorrow's meet, Da-
vidson will run in the State meet
at Raleigh against Duke, U.N.C.,
and N.C. State. Davidson has never
climbed out of last place in this
meet, but this year it has a good
chance of taking second or third.

After the State meet, they travel
again to Williamsburg for the Con-
ference meet in which they will be
the dark horse contender for the
championship. The following week,
they will participate in the Caro-
line’s A.A.U. here at Davidson.

Gray Ended Davidson
Career With Furman

By JOHN

HANDLEY

Last week’s Furman encounter marked not only a humilia-
ting loss for the Cats as far as the score was concerned, but

more important, the loss of the offensive sparkplug, Johnny
Gray. The slim speedster made his last appearance in a Wild-

cat football uniform as a leg injury put him out of action for

the rest of the season.

There have been many “ifs” in
Davidson football talk in the past,
but here one might well be added.
Had Gray’s early injury against the
Hurricane last weekend not oc-
curred, there might well have been
a considerable difference in the
score.

During the last two year’s of his
Davidson football career, Gray has
been the guiding light of the of-
fense and one of the best safety-
men in the business. During this
season especially, Johnny has
proved to be the sparkplug of the
team. -
Switched to Offense

Gray_was used mostly on de-
fense during his first two years
on the squad, but after his per-
formance in the State encounter
last year, he has been an offensive
regular. He played at the halfback
spot last year until Jack Ruth was
sidelined at which time he moved
in to show his worth under the
center, He has played quarterback
consistently this season.

New Chesterfield
Contest To Open
With Next Game

Many of you remember the Ches-
terfield Sports Quiz that was run
in The Davidsonian in years past.
This week Charlie Hall, the repre-
sentative for Chesterfield cigar-
ettes on the Davidson campus, an-
nounced that a new Chesterfield
Sports Contest is now under way.

Hall stated that this contest is
in the form of a guessing game
whereby the Davidson student
body will be given a chance to
predict the score of Davidson's
football game for that week with
a carton of Chesterfields going
each week to the owner of the
correct or nearest correct predic-
tion.

Hall stated the rules for the
contest as follows: Each score pre-
diction to be written on an empty
wrapper from a pack of Chester-
fields, either regular or king size,
along with the contestant’s name
and room number and deposited
in the Chesterfield box in the Stu-
dent Store of the College Union.

Each week’s contest will be open
until 12 o’clock Saturday, with
the winner being given his Ches-
terfields on the following Monday.
In case of a tie, duplicate prizes
will be given.

Each Friday the winner from
the previous week will be an-
nounced in this column along with
any news of the outcome and
progress of the contest.

your prediction?

SPE 12, Pika 6 (Overtime)

In a fast and exciting game the
Sig Eps edged the Pikas by the
score of 12 to 6. Joe Pharr was
the big man in the Pika attack
while Fred Stowe and Bill Marable
led the winning attack.

Kapps Sigme 27, Phi Gem 7

The Kappa Sigs defeated the
Phi Gams by the score of 27 to
7. Corky Clark and Lacy Keesler

Moore was the standout for the
Phi Gams.

Sigma Chi 34, Pika 18

The Sigma Chis rolled to another
victory in a very fast game as they
downed the Pikas 34-18. Big Ray

with his passing and running. Bob
Owen and Bill Hanna paced. the
Pika attack.

eral nice runs for the winners. Bill

Lay Unbeaten Record
On Line At Carolina

Tomororw will find the Kitten's
cross country team running the
University of North Carolina fresh-
men. Both teams will enter the
race undefeated, Carolina having
won their first three starts.

Pete Ashcraft will meet one of
the better runners of the South
in Jimmy Bertie, last year’s North
Carolina mile champion. The Da-
vidson team will have to rely on
their strength in depth to continue
their unbeaten string.

Last Monday the Wildkitten
thinclads turned back Pfieffer Jr.
College for the second time by the
close score of 26-30. Pete Ashcraft
again paced the field and finished
the 3.3 mile course in the fast time
of 18:15. Ted Baker finished fourth
with Bill Jackson, Frank Kiker,
and John Holshouser taking the
6th, 7th and 8th places.

The Davidson runners’ wasn’t
used to the longer Pfieffer course,
and this may explain their poorer
showing. The week before they had
beaten Pfieffer on the Davidson
course by a relatively comfortable
margin.

Marable led the SPE attack.

SAE 21, Pi Kappa Phi 19
The SAEs downed the Pi Kapps
in a very close game as extra points
meant the deciding edge. The

Footballers Hit Crimsons
In Intersectional Clash

By JIM HOLSHOUSER

Davidson’s winless Wildcats run up against another tough customer tomorrow when
they meet Harvard’s powerful Crimsons at Cambridge, Massachusettes. The intersectional
clash pits the Cats against one of the best teams in the Ivy League. The Davidson team has
worked long and hard in practice this week in preparation for the game. The injury of
Johnny Gray on the kick-of at Furman last week will keep him out for the rest of the season.

WILDKITTENS HOST
TO GEORGIA TEAM
IN LAST ‘AT HOME

The Davidson College freshman
football team will be hosts to Gor-
don Military College of Barnes-
ville, Georgia, this Saturday after-
noon in what promises to be a
real battle. The whistle will blow
for the kickoff in the local stadium
at 2:30 p.m., and the Kittens will
be gunning for their second win
of the season after losing to Fur-
man in their last encounter.

Gordon Junior College will bring
to Davidson a very strong and de-
termined squad. They have had a
very good season so far this year,
downing McCallie 13 to 7, and they
are reported to have edged Georgia
Military Academy, 12-7. The con-
test should prove to be a rugged
battle as both teams will be “up”
for the game.

Coach Hambright feels that his
squad is in wonderful spirit. but
he believes it will take sixty min-
utes of smart playing by each of
his men to play Gordon a good
game. ~

The team has greatly improved
in the last two weeks and seems
to be in good physical shape for
the encounter.

The two ends, Tom Newton and
Bill Gramley, have been catching
the ‘passes and tackling much bet-

ter in the past few practices.

Also the tackles, Brewer and
Lawing have been charging much
faster and hitting more viciously
as well as fine performances from
Lewyllen and Hatcher at the guard
positions.

The freshman center Randy
Johnston has a broken finger, but
is eager to play and will be ready
for the opening kickoff.

The Kitten. backfield has been
fighting for extra yardage during
practice sessions and have been
hitting very hard; they looked more
polished this week than they have
all season.

After the Kittens meet Gordon
tomorrow they will journey to
Charleston, S.C., to close the sea-
son by playing The Citadel on
November 7. This should prove to
be a real battle for Hambright’s
men since The Citadel freshmen
tied Furman, 7-7.

The loss of Gray has left the
Wildeats with only one experi-
enced signal-caller, Bill Rowland.
Henry Brown, who played the post
frequently in the early part of the
season, will probably be moved
back to quarterback in tomorrow’s
game when Rowland needs a rest.

Last week, Furman took a 34-0
victory over the Cats, as they
scored in every period except the
second. The Davidson eleven never
got rolling, and the Purple Hurri-
cane showed why they are fifth in
the nation in rushing offense as
they ground out 504 yards on the
ground.

Impressive Record

Harvard has won three of its
four contests this season and
looked very impressive in doing

so. The Crimson's only loss was
at the hands of Columbia, 6-0. They

have taken victories over Ohio
University, Colgate, and Dart-
mouth.

Harvard sports one of the finest
tailbacks in the country in Dick
Clasby. Clasby was selected for
All-American honors on many pre-
season polls. He is also captain of
the Harvard eleven.

The Crimsons will not be tak-
ing tomorrow's game lightly. Un-
doubtedly, they still have visions
of last year’s game which almost
turned into a nightmare. Cam.

bridge newspapers had prédicted
an easy win, with the Harvard sub-
stitutes playing most of the game.

Repeat Performance?

Instead, a fired-up bunch of
southerners out-played the Crim-
sons and almost won the game.
After trailing the Wildcats for
three quarters, the Harvard team
barely squeaked by with a one-
touchdown victory.

With the exception of Grey, the
Wildcats will be at full strength
tomorrow. Co-Captain Ben Craig
has returned to the team work-outs
this week, but the extent that
Coach Dole will use him is un:
certain.

Volleyball Tourney

{Slated For Davidson

Early Next Spring

The Southeastern U. S. Inter-
collegiate Volleyball Tournament
is set to be played here on the
Davidson College campus early in
March.

This will be the initial college
tournament of its kind for this
general area of the U.S., and the
invitations to play in this tourna-
ment will be sent to all schools of
the area.

Florida State University of Tal-
lahassee which last year was fourth
in the national volley finals, will
definitely participate in the con-
test here on the local courts.

Mr. Paul Scott, chairman for the
event, recently announced that
Davidson's team will be determined
after tryouts which will be held
in December. All students, includ-
ing freshmen, are eligible to com-
pete for the team and represent the
Cats in this Southeastern tourna-
ment.

This year the Volleyball team
will not be considered as a regu-
lar intercollegiate team such as
basketball, therefore no letters or
awards will be given. It is purely
an opportunity for those interested
in playing to get on a well-organ-
ized team and represent the college
in outside competition.

However, in the future it may be
included as intercollegiate sport.
