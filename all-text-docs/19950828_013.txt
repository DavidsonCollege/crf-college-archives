OPen- HEART SURGERY
AND SELLY DOUGHNUTS

_ Students remember their summer jobs -

By JoHN CopENHAVER
Arts & Living Editor

When I arrived back on cam-
pus from this summer it seemed
like the most frequent question I
asked was: “What did you do this
summer?” It did not take long for
this question to mutate into an ar-
ticle about student summer jobs.
Of course, it is impossible for me
to relate what everyone did over
the summer so I decided just to
pick a few of the most interesting
job experiences I could find and
relate them.

Senior Allison Sabel had a
tremendous learning experience
when she went to Vienna, Austria
with a Dean Rusk grant to be a
medical extern (only called interns
after medical school). The first
day on the job as soon as she ar-
rived the doctor told her to get
ready because her presence was
needed in surgery. As an extern
she thought that surely all she
would be doing was observing sur-
gery in process. The doctor told
her that the patient, which hap-
pened to be an infant, had a hole in
its heart. After she had scrubbed
up, she turned to the doctor-for her
next instructions. He handed her a
scalpel and told her to start cutting.
After overcoming her shock and
nervousness she managed to ex-
ecute a successful open-heart.sur-
gery on an infant almost all by
herself. As the summer went on
she had many other similar experi-

ences including the loss of a child
while under surgery. Losing the
infant was her hardest learning
experience, and one of the most
difficult moments she has ever had
to face.

Teresa White, a sophomore

from Charleston, South Carolina,’

spent her summer working in a
Krispy Kreme doughnut shop. Al-
though filling doughnuts with jelly
and cream every Tuesday and
Thursday is not as exciting as open
heart surgery, she had a learning
experience of a different sort.
Krispy Kreme was more than just
a doughnut store. It was a meeting
place, a crossroads, for all differ-
ent sorts of people. The building

she worked in-had changed very

little since it was built in 1954
therefore setting a mood which
attracted a variety of regulars to

the shop. One of her most memo-

rable costumers was Johnny. He
has been a dishwasher for most of
his life, but writes poetry on the
side. Poetry is his passion, but he
can only write when he is pos-
sessed by the spirit of Edgar Allan
Poe. He has great hopes of being
published someday. According to
White, Johnny gets three cups of
coffee and no baked goods. Dough-
nuts really do not suit his style.

Carolina. The camp was created

broadened its scope to include both

mentally and physically handi-
capped counselors. Mahoney says
that helping and entertaining handi-
capped children is an uplifting ex-
perience. It “makes you realize
how trivial yourown problems are”
in comparison with the kids. Al-
though the counselors are there to

_ teach and encourage the disabled

kids, Mahoney says the camp is

not so much about “what we teach’

the kids but what they teach us.”
Sophomore Elizabeth Field
spent her summer in Washington,

D.C. interning at The American, .

Association for the Advancement
of Science. She did everything
from writing and editing in En-
glish and Spanish to playing social
coordinator for different functions.
She also had to give demonstra-
tions of different science experi-
ments such as the Butterfly Color
Explosion Experiment to groups
of educators. One of her most
interesting insights she gained from
her job was an insiders view of the

Washington bureaucracy. She says
that very few government employ-
ees work hard and that long lunch ~
breaks and frequent “business”
trips abound in our nation’s capi-
tal. Surprise, surprise.

If you were wondering why
the campus was so beautifully
painted, why the Freshmen Hand-
book was so sharp, or why the
number of Davidson applicants is
up, you might just find out the
answer if you were at Davidson
this summer. Russ Tarver, ‘Josh
Buchanan, and William Robert all
stayed in Davidson this summer
working and assortment of jobs.
Tarver was part of a painting crew
that repainted the inside of the se-
nior apartments, the outside. of
some of the fraternity houses, the
Union Café and the outside of Prior.
Buchanan worked hard editing the
Freshman Handbook, and Robert
sweated it out in the Admissions
Office. When asked. what they

mer, they all. agreed that it was
getting to know a bunch of people
you normally would not meet and
