Historian to Discuss Cultural
Context of Gone with the Wind

By LISA GERRARD —

In an upcoming. lecture at .
Davidson College, noted historian
“black America”

Joel Williamson will discuss Mar-
garet Mitchell’s Novel Gone with
the Wind inthe’context of race, sex

~andviolence inthe American South between races wiltexist as long as sored by the Kelley Program in

‘of the early 1900s.

The lecture is free and begins
at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 25,
in the 900 Room of the College
Union. Williamson, a history pro-
fessor at UNC Chapel Hill, is a
specialist in race relations and has

written several books on black-

white relations in the South since
emancipation. sa

Inhis lecture, Williamson will
pose the unusual question, “How

‘plack was Rhett Butler?” He be-

lieves that “white America” and
are closely re-
lated by an inevitable and ongoing
kinship. He says that separation

white America revolts against this
awareness.
“White America, in its stub-

born and residual egotism, resists _

the realization of how very deeply
and irreversibly black itis, and has

been,” he wrote in A Rage of Or-

der.
“To recognize and respect the

blackness wee is Medes A within

themselves would be to recognize
and respect the blackness that is
within the nation,” he wrote. “It is
an unhappy. world that white
America has made, andi itis unnec-
essary.”

Williamson’s lecture, spon-

Historical. Studies, grows out of
his current research on the lives
and work of southern writers. The
Kelley Program was established in
1988 inmemory of 1963 Davidson
graduate Kendrick K. Kelley to
encourage work among history
students. For more information on

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 25 , 1990 3

Grahman Allison, former dean of the Kennedy School spoke about

"After the Cold War."

Graham Allison of
Harvard Speaks

By TRENT STEVENS

“Beyond the Cold War” was
the theme of a recent 900 Room
speech by-Graham Allison, a pro-
fessor and former dean of Harvard
University’ s John F, -Kennedy
School of Government.

Allison contended that the
focal point of U.S. foreign policy
for the past four decades has becn
the Soviet Union and the military
competition with the Sovict Un-
ion. He claimed that the Sovict
“threat” was the justification for
the increasingly higher U.S. mili-
tary expenditures of this era.

Butas heacknowledgcd, “The
Cold War ended.” He said that this
represented a victory of the objcc-
tives of American foreign policy.
“The old verities that folks learned
previously no longer hold,” he
stated. “Most of the fixed points of
the Cold War,” he said, “are fixed
points that have vanished or are
currently vanishing.”

“We are going to have to think
again,” isthe conclusion he reached

‘regarding the current situation, in

which he referred to the Soviet
Union as “a vanishing fiction.” He
noted that many fundamental ques-
tions regarding the future of Ameri-
can foreign policy are now rele-
vant.

In fact, he ventured to make a

prediction. of. a “second Russian

Revolution”, even more profound
than the first one, which he com-
pared to the French Revolution.
“In the months ahead, and almost

Ls - certainly before the school year is

out, the Soviet Union will cease to
exist,” he said.

Boris Yeltsin, President of the
Russian republic, is the individual
he credited as being a principle

a force behind the current reforms,

which he said began as a top-down
exercise with the advents of

glasnost and perestroika. Also, hc
suggested that even if the current
government continues to exist, he
regarded a name change of the
country to be a likely event:

He cited six alternative futures

for the state of the Soviet Union
during the course of the next three
to five years. The first of these is a
disintegration of the Soviet Union

into a loose confedcration of So-

vict republics with disestablished

central ministrics and a move to

market economics in cach of the

republics at their own individual

paces.

The next alternative he sug-
gested was a continuation of the
slowing down of the Sovict Union,
which he referred to as “muddling
through” or “muddling down.” He
felt that this would eventually Icad
to a state of general confusion.

~ The third possibility he high-
lighted was the one he felt was
least likely: an orderly evolution
ofamarketcconomy andademoc-
racy with some limited decentrali-
zation. Although Washington
seems to hope that this is the even-
tual outcome of the recentchanges, -
Allison alluded to the enthusiasm
of the demands of the Soviet rc-
publics as being a factor blocking
such an evolution..

The reassertion of authoritar-
ian discipline in the Soviet Union
or in some of its component parts
was his fourth-alternative future,
and one of the ones he considered
least likely. The Russian state, the
KGB and the Russian military were
the forces that he felt could main-
tain the absolute authority of the
central government, as found in -
the pre-Gorbachev Sovict Union.

A fifth future consisted of a
civil war, which he suggested could
result from the breakdown of the

‘military hierarchy. Toback up this
