Stones Maintain ‘Insanity

A REVIEW
By JOE EARLE

Those people who ignored
the reviews and trekked .out
to see ‘‘Gimme Shelter’ had
the. privilege of watching the
Woodstock Generation cut
down in full color.

On stage, overseeing, and
trying to curtail, the tribal!
castration were The Rolling
Stones, the focus of the film
and perhaps the only great
band left from the early six-
ties.

ee

The Stones muaiiiitain the
insanity of old blues and
rock. Wyfile other. musical
trends favor the subdued
country-folk music of Woody
Guthrie or Jimmy Rogers,
the Stones turned back to
Chuck Berry. f

‘Let It Bleed,” the last re-
cording on London for .the
group, was a returm to old
style blues from Robert John-
son on, and their new rec
ord, on a new label, is closer
to the old rock-rhythm:-and-
blues of Memphis.

“Sticky Fingers,” the first
release of Rolling Stones
Records, and produced by
Jimmy Miller, late of Chess
Records, is perhaps their
best yet. i

But even the Stones have
not escaped the currents in
music. ‘‘Sticky Fingers” iis a
very different type of endeav-
er for the Stones.

The old saunchiness is
there. It is in ‘Andy Warhol's
(another personage of the
60's undergoing artistic
changes) cover, which is de-
signed to offer ia feeling of
perversity before one ever
hears the music. It is in
“Brown Sugar” and ‘‘Bitch”
the two plug cuts on the ra-
dio. ‘But the brashness, the
overtones of perversity, have
been ‘‘softened’’.

‘Bitch’ features a Muscle
Shoals-type horn section.
“Brown Sugar’ is coated
with ‘saxaphone. But the
greatest changes are deep-
er in the album.

“Wild Horses,’’ a song de-
buted in “Gimme Shelter’,
pretty song that, not
withstanding weferences to
heroin, is romantic. ‘Moon-
light Mile"’ features a string
seclion and soft ending more
reminiseant of Phil Spector
and The. Beatles than the
Sisiter ~ Morphine,”

A REVIEW
By GREG GERDY

The opening performance
of Martin and Sally Truss,
and their friend Peter was
done before the usual open-
ing night at Davidson; a few
horny baseball players with
nothing to do, a music freak
or two, a DAVIDSONIAN re

porter, and. several stage-
hands
Faced with this meager

turnout, the group proceeded
to please them with some of
the best °music heard in the
Hungry d iin a long time.
The true pleasure of their
works could have better been
appreciated on a big week
end here or in ‘a small bar
in New York as part of a
nice quiet date.

The group is from Alberta
in Canada wand more pre-
cisely from tthe foothills of
the Canadian Rockies. Their
sound is light and pleasant
and along the lines of Gor-
don Lightfoot and Tom Rush
when Martin is singing, and
like Judy Collins ‘when Sally
begins.

The trio opened with a
soft number, ‘Four Poster

Perhaps the Stones are, as
The New. York Times sug-
gested, merely trying to re
main “‘relevant.’’ Perhaps
they are merely feeling the
musical growing pains that
have affected a lot of old
groups. Perhaps now under
iheir own steam they are
merely doing wit they've
wanted to all along. Perhaps
Jimmy Miller has renoviated
their presentation.

Whatever “the reasons for
the new style presented on
“Sticky Fingers", it is ac
ceptable. This is one of the
best records released this
year, and the best I've heard
yet from wan old group, It’ is
a terrific record.

doing the works of other art-
