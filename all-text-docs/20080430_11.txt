mission and fly away, Finch jumps off in an
effort to save his friend’s life.

The final plot consists of Malley and a stu-
dent, Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield), dis-
cussing the student’s increasing lack of inter-
est in his education. Hayes sees no point in
doing well in school, only to go on to
become a politician, when lying and cheating
seem to be the only way to get elected.

Again, Redford aims his criticism directly
at politicians in Washington with Hayes’
frustration, Prof. Malley then proceeds to tell
Hayes about his two former students (now
Marines), who interpreted their potential as
ability to fight for their country.

The stories come together in a depressing
finale that sums up the failure and dishonest
nature of the American government.

The Marines cannot protect their men; the
media cannot portray the truth; the govern-
ment will spin a story in any way that boosts
its reputation. In a sense, Redford’s film
serves as a voice for all men and women in
uniform whose roles in this war have as yet
gone unnoticed.
