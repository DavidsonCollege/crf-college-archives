Lloyd accepts blame for Bow! loss

By CHARLES E. LLOYD
Faculty Guest Columnist

We have it on the best authority
that honest confession is good for the
soul, That may be true, says ‘the
cynic, but it plays hob with the
reputation. I must, alas, agree; but,
since souls are more precious than
reputations, I’d better get on with my
confessing.

By the time this appears, the
stations in the UNC-TV network will
have broadcast the First Annual
North Carolina English College Bow]
Tournament, won by North Carolina
State over Daw oa EAitor.

PCC sponsors open dance

To the Editor:

The eating houses and fraternities
of Davidson College are sponsoring a
campus-wide dance this Saturday
from 9:00 to 12:00 in Belk Quad. The
Brice Street Band, which played in
the gym for Spring Frolics last year,
will provide the music; beer and coke
will be available for refreshment,

While it would seem that a college
social calendar would be sprinkled
with outside dances, concerts and the
like, the frequency of such events at
Davidson has been very small. The
possibility of future functions de-

pends on the success of this one.:e.,
Therefore certain preparations and
precautions must be taken.

Student volunteers wearing red
arm bands will be present to assist
where needed. The beer and coke will
be centrally located in an easily
accessible position off the quad with
students available to dispense the

beverages. Cooperation is required in’

State had defiatedk bs + Uaiverelty of
North Carolina in the first round, and

preventing damage to Belk, Watts,
Cannon and the surrounding areas.
Students attending the dance should
lock their doors in an effort to prevent
theft. Those who intend to study
Saturday evening will find the DCPC
classrooms open.

This dance, which is part of the

East Carolttia had beaten Yactioc”
That loss was my fault. I. had...
picked the team and tra
and they did what I told
curdles my Vichyssoise to think of the

hard work of Bill Barnes,’ Aida Doss, -

Howard Payne; Steve » and

' Tom Ruby, and the loss they took. I .

apologize to these gallant Davidson-
ians, and promise to dedicate the next.
bull I kill to them.

I could say I went. into our
four-corners offense too early, or that
my eldest son used up the family’s
weekly allotment of good luck (he won
two lawsuits), or that I picked the

Spring Activities Day; will be moved
to the 900 Room in the event of rain.
The band is excellent, the beer will
be cold and a party in Belk Quad
should be an excellent way to end a

pleasant day.

U. of Ohio tennis coach
commends Davidson team

To the Editor:

This is an open letter to the entire
Davidson College community.

I serve as men’s varsity tennis

coach at Ohio University, Athens, .

Ohio. Each year I bring my team on a
tour of the Atlantic coastal states
during the latter part of March. The
past two years we have engaged the
fine Davidson team, capably coached

Cuniiity Tiles ieanthe Done

ed ae

by Jeff Frank, in competition.

My players and I haye been very
impressed with both the sportman-
ship of the players, and the friendly
attitude and hospitality of the David-
son students and staff.

Our collective ‘‘hats off’ to you all!

D.J. Stephenson
Tennis Coach
Ohio University

wrong Majo: ‘Bat 1 won" Coote my
readers with laughing lies.

rActua aigt piekthemat jos: of
1969 in 1
had begun to ‘bdr my clippings. I
forgot that, we won in 1969 by running
scared; this time L was-armored in
SECURITY. If-you-ever feel invinci-
ble, dear brothers and sisters, look
out! (Don’t take my word for it; ask
Macbeth. The meanest trick the
Weird Sisters played on him was to
convince him he was unstoppable.)

The College Bowl (not just English)
is being revived; there is already a
Southeastern Conference, in which all
the teams listed above have been
participating for over a year. I’m sure
it will be on national television soon, I
hope again with a generous sponsor
and lovely trips to the Big Wicked
City for the teams chosen. I'd love to
assist anybody who wants to partici-
pate; if I’m not wanted as coach, I’ll
keep score and write questions.

And we’ve got to wipe out Lloyd’s
loss next year at Raleigh.

What say the students, upon whom
in this, as in all other vital Davidson
matters, all depends?

Whatever you say, I want to thank
all the Davidson students: the girls
for being so pretty and the youths for
being so -fine;-and_to both for putting
up with me. You are wonderful

people.
