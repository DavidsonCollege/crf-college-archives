WAY DOWN SOUTH IN THE LAND OF COTTON

Members of History Professor Sally McMillan’s Old South class spend a
day relieving stress by picking cotton at the Brattonville Plantation last week.

many students as possible on what
would be a semi-permanent, uni-
versal guest list, to comply with
the “closed” party stipulation. That
list would be composed of active
Court members as well as inde-
pendents who paid $20 to $30 a
semester for a Patterson Court
“membership.”

PCC Treasurer and Kappa
Sigma President Burt Arrington
delineates three factors which in-
fluenced the PCC’s decision to
charge independents. “The first
issue is the cost factor,” he says..

He continues, “I see the sec-
ond one as a liability issue.” By
limiting parties to affiliated stu-
dents and paying independents, the
PCC will generate a set guest list,
allowing houses to label their par-
ties “‘closed” and allowing houses
to meet insurance regulations.

The third factor seems to be
one of fairness. “I think it’s wrong
when people say that fraternity

members are only paying $15, .

while independents have to pay
$25,” says PCC President Steven
Shames, “when really it’s about
$115 to $25,” since fraternity mem-
bers pay approximately $100. for
risk management and insurance
already.

Outgoing Senior Class Presi-

dent and Sigma Phi Epsilon brother
B.J. Rudell, Gul, New head inde-
pendent senator Brandon Clarke,
SGA Chancellor Dennis Seavers,
outgoing senior senator Gautam
Srinivasan, and independent stu-
dent Mary Baxter have an alter-
nate plan in mind (see their letter
on page 7). The coalition wants all
students to pay a Court fee which
would be included in their tuition
bill. Thus, every student would be
a Court member and have access to

all parties.
The senators will be submit-

ting a letter to Kurt Holmes this
week outlining the plan. The pro-
posal assumes a $22,000 annual
risk management budget. Each
house will be returned $500 of its
user’s fee from the Dean’s Office.
Additionally, affiliated students
would pay an extra $9 per year in
tuition, and nonaffiliated students
an éxtra $20 dollars. According to
the letter, this proposal will raise
$23,300.

The senators argue in the let-
ter “that this new proposal will
make Patterson Court more afford-
able, more inclusive, and more
enjoyable for all.”

The letter also argues that ap-
proximately 25% of the student
body would be “completely iso-
lated from the Court. Granted, this
separation would arise purely
through individuals’ choices, as
each pérson could decide whether
or not to become a ‘member.’ But
is this separatist attitude something
we wish to espouse?”

ably go to a professor that is cur-
rently here.”

The Campaign for Davidson
will continue its efforts until the

June 30 deadline. Crosland says,
“I’m sure there will be more con-
tributions.”

Crosland places no stock in
being the donor who put the Cam-
paign for Davidson over the top of
its goal.

Ina way, it’s an opportunity to
put the final touches on a wonder-
ful campaign,” he says. “I’m glad
just to play a part in it, whether I
was first or last.”

And in the most shocking turn
of events, the PCC yesterday
evening voted by a six to four
margin not to charge independents
for the 1995-96 school year. How-
ever, the vote may have been dif-
ferent had five members of the
PCC been present for the vote.
The only certainty about the aris-
ing debate is its amorphous char-
acter and its uncertainty.

Of the vote, Shames says, “It
does [mean something] right now.

I’m not sure how.”
The debate at the PCC meet-

ing reflected the broad spectrum of
opinions being expressed in the
student body at large. PiKA was
definitely “vocal against the
changes,” says Shames. Whit
Higgins of PiKA said, “TI think it’s
really something that will divide
this campus. Less independents
will join; the PCC will see its influ-
ence go down.” Shames said, “Ido
not think it’s unreasonable to ask
independents to contribute.”

Part of the concern prompting
the PCC to reverse its proposal
seems to be public relations.
Arrington said, “If people take time
to understand the facts,” they will
recognize the fairness of the pro-
posal. But he continued, “It’s re-
ally easy to take the superficial.”
Higgins said, “Truth has very little
to do with this. Truth doesn’t mat-
ter. Headline is the reality ofit. All
they have to do is read an easy
headline.”

There was also debate about
the financing of the proposal.

Judge Samuel J.
Ervin lll to speak

By ANNIE CARR
Staff writer

The Hon. Samuel J. Ervin III,
Chief Judge of the U.S. Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals, comes to
Davidson on Tuesday, April 11 to
talk about the challenges faced by
the federal court system.

Ervin, here at the invitation of
the Pre-Law Society, isa Davidson
graduate of the Class of ‘48. He is
a member of KA and Phi Beta
Kappa. ;

Former Society Co-chair
Scott Hile, who was responsible
for planning this event, says, “What
we’ re trying to dois have big speak-
ers come here to discuss relevant
legal issues. Judge Ervin will be
commenting on the judicial per-
spective on the 104th Congress
and some of its actions.”

Among the actions Ervin will
discuss is Congress’ recent deci-

sion toreclassify some state crimes
as federal offenses, which will
greatly increase the workload of
the federal courts. Ervin believes
that greater emphasis on criminal
hearings, . especially drug-related
cases, is clogging up the system
and crowding out the administra-
tion of civil cases.

Ervin will also speak about
his concern with the courts’ bud-
getary problems, including the con-
troversy over the construction of
expensive new court buildings in
New York and Boston.

Ervin received his law degree
from Harvard in 1951, after which
he set up a private practice. He
served as a judge in the Superior
Court from 1967 to 1980, when he
was appointed to the Court of Ap-
peals. He has been the Chief Jus-
tice of that court since 1989. His
daughter and two sons are
Davidson alumni as well.

Students travel to
mountains for Love
of Learning retreat

Last weekend the 18 newly-

appointed. Counselor siege pals Mentors, MR OE uu, oie alge aS
he ove fT eae ae Ronald Ross, a consultant to the
gram got together for a weekend RJR Company who gave Friday's

retreat at Inn the Oaks on Black
Mountain. These students spent a
weekend bonding, communicating,
and having fun in order to prepare
for their summer jobs of guiding
90 Charlotte area high school stu-
dents through a four week “aca-
demic camp” of classes taught at
Davidson over the summer.

Love of Learning students and
counselors will live in Davidson

‘dorms, eat, play, and take classes

from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day. The
goal'of the program is to help stu-
dents that want to learn more and
don’t have appropriate opportuni-

“How. to Survive on a Predomi-
nantly White Campus” talk.

He helped the students learn
how to take on the roles of surro-
gate parent, friend, teacher, and
guide that the they will need dur-
ing the summer and the school
year.

Associate Director of Love of
Learning Joan T. Miller called the
retreat “a success towards our goal
of building a cohesive team.”

Higgins said, “I think it’s very rea-
sonable to ask the houses to pay. I
think basically this is Patterson
Court paying for its future.”
Arrington said, “You’ve got $115
a year [from affiliated students}
right off the bat as opposed to $50
a year [from independents].”

The debate also focused on
risk management. Shames said in
an interview late Sunday night,
“People cannot divorce the two
issues: risk management and fi-

portant thing. The goal is to find
the best risk management and how
to finance it.”

In light of the PCC’s veto of
its own proposal, Shames is re-
grouping and considering petition-
ing the Board of Trustees for fund-
ing. The PCC is also going to
consult the houses more closely.
Says Shames, “A big factor will be
what the houses have to say.”

Arrington and Shames will
present the whole issue to the
CCRL on Tuesday.
