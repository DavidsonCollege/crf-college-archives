Davidson College Band
Takes Pleasant Trip

Men Render Varied Programs in Mon-
treat, Asheville and Lincolnton

The band made its first trip of the sea-
son last week, leaving Thursday morning
on the 9 o'clock train. Three engage-
ments were filled, one each at Montreat
Normal, Asheville Normal and the Lin-
colnton High School. Splendid audi-
ences heard cach of the concerts, which
were rendered in an excellent manner.

The program's middle name was “Va-
riety.” There was something for all the
varying tastes of a heterogenous audi-
ence, ranging from “Carmen” to “Wang
Wang Blues.”

° The saxophone quartet, composed of
White, Buchanan, Booth and Nesbit, the
latest addition to the band, made a
splendid hit, and won many encores.

The violin solos by Buchanan not only
demonstrated the versatility of the pro-
gram, but also that he was an adept
with the bow, and the Spanish Folk
Songs, sung by White, never fail to be
very pleasing to the most discriminating
audiences; while Beck’s rendition of the
slip-horn productions “slide” in for their |
place on a well rounded out program. |

The first performance was given at the
Montreat Normal College. The troupe |
arrived there in the early afternoon and!
were taken to the college by automo-!
biles. A reception by th® students was '
given in honor of the organization dur- |
ing the afternoon and proved to be an}
enjoyable affair.

At the conclusion of the performance
the fellows hung around a while, andi
from all reports a good many of them
lost their hearts due to the moon, the
mountain scenery, etc., etc.

Going up on the train things were
kept lively by the saxophone quartet,
consisting of Buchanan, White, ‘Booth
and Nesbitt. The crowd also enjoyed
seeing the man who claims to have the
longest beard in the world.

Due to the kindness of the college au-
thorities, the girls were given a half
holiday Friday morning, which accounts
for the lengthy sojourn of the boys
here.

About 1:30 p. m. Friday, Director Free-
man sounded “Assembly,” calling forth
the members of the organization from
the nooks, crannies and mountain caves.

The troupe arrived in Asheville about
3 p. m., and enjoyed seeing the sights of
the city. One member of the organiza-
tion tells the story that “Willie P.” Nes-
bitt would have made his debut into the

J. P. PRICE “Y” PRESIDENT
FOR 1921-1922.

J. P. Price was elected president, C.
E. Cunningham vice-president, and C. R.
Crawford secretary, in the Y. M. C. A.
election held Monday morning.

At a meeting called Saturday for the
choosing of new “Y” officers three men
were nominated for the position of pres-
ident, June-bug Price, Ed Cunningham,
and Mac Richards. No one man receiv-
ed a majority, so on Monday a second
ballot was taken which gave Price the
number of votes necessary for election
and made Cunningham, second high man,
vice-president.

Those nominated for secretary were
Stewart Buchanan, Bob Davidson, Pat
Crawford, and Hugh Smith. The final
ballot, between Crawford and Smith,
placed the former in the secretary's
chair.

The men just elected to “Y” offices are

Tennis Team

All Plans Laid for Selection of This
Spring’s Net Artists

“Are you ready?”

“Let ’em come!”

These and a regular hubbub of other
such shouts are filling the new tennis
courts these days. Favored by the best
tennis weather in many years, and by the
impetus of good new courts, the tennis
outlook for this spring is unusually
bright.

This year’s schedule is probably the
heaviest Davidson has ever had, and will
call for the very best tennis the old
college can put out. The following is a
tentative outline:

April 13—Lenoir College, at Hickory.

April 21—Trinity Coltege, at Davidson.

April 27 to 30—N. C. Intercollegiate
Tournament, at Greensboro.

May 4~—Elon College, at Davidson.

May 13—Lenoir College, at Davidson.

Last of May—S. I. A. A. Tournament,
at Atlanta.

The Varsity Tournament, held on the
campus, will probably begin on Thurs-
day afternoon, March 24th, and close on
the following Wednesday, March jist.
The schedule will be posted on the
Chambers bulletin board. In this tour-:
nament the four best men are to be
chosen to form the college team. The
fifth best man to be called the best play-
er outside of the team, may challenge for
a place on the team, and if he defeats
the member of the team whom he chal-

|lenges, a committee in charge will take

definite action toward giving him this
place on the team. Likewise any mem-
ber of the student body may challenge
this fifth best man, and defeating him,
take his place. All such challenges and
the decisigns from such challenges are
to be in charge of a committee to be ap-
pointed and later announced. In this
way any man in the student body may
work his way to the team, if he has the
real ability. ’

Now that Davidson has good courts
and faces a heavy schedule, may not this

as fine a set as Davidson has ever had,,be the best year she has ever had in

and great things are to be expected in|

the year 1921-1922.

f

tennis? If it is to be such, every man
must get out and do his best.

| Fresh-Soph Debate

'D. H. Ogden and L. P. Burney Win

Debater’s Medals in Heated Contest

The annual Fresh-Soph debate was
held in the Eumenean Literary Society
hall on Monday night, March 21st. The
‘query debated was: “Resolved, that the
Smith-Towner Educational Bill should
be adopted.”

The affirmative side was upheld by the
Philanthropic Socicty. The debaters for
the Phi's were L. P. Burney, W. Z. Brad-
ford, and A. S. McIlwain.

The negative side of the question was
|supported by the Eumenean Society. R.
F, Davidson, R. H. Smith, and D. H. Og-
den were the debaters of the Eu. So-
ciety.

The decision of the judges was in
favor of the negative. The best debater,
as chosen by the judges, from the af-
firmative side,-was L. P. Burney, and
from the negative, D. H. Ogden.

Burney ‘was the first speaker on the
He gave a very clear defi-

the points to be taken up by the affirm-

_ative in the order of the speakers. His
debate was excellent.
Davidson, the first speaker on the

negative, after pointing out the needs
of a remedy for the present educational
system, stated in clear terms the issues
of his side of the question.

Bradford, the second on the affirma-
tive, argued from a point of illiteracy,
Americanization, and physical education.
He gave a number Of statistics in proof
of his statements.

Smith, the second on the negative, ar-
gued two points: That such a system
would stunt educational growth, and that
it would tend to centralize power.

Mcllwain, third on the affirmative,
pointed out the advantages that would
be realized by the adoption of this sys-
tem.

Ogden, the last speaker of the nega-
tive, offered a better solution to the
problems of education. His solution was
the adoption of the Rotary Board as
proposed by Dr. Boroughs, and now in
use by the States of New York and Mas-
sachusetts. Ogden delivered his well
prepared debate with much force, and
showed excellent ability as a speaker.

Davidson Baseball Season
Starts With a Rush

New York University, Oak Ridge and
Carolina to Test Mettle of Wild-
cats in Next Four Days

This week witnesses the start of the
college baseball season throughout the ~
South, and the enthusiastic fans of the
national pastime will watch with inter-

‘est the efforts of their favorites. David-

son is no exception to the rule, and when
“play ball” is called Thursday afternoon
on Sprunt Field the career of the 1921
Wildcat baseball team will be launched.
At that time the Red and Black cohorts
will be matched against the representa-
tives of New York University, and they
are determined to annex the initial
game, worthy as their opponents may be.
The following two days will be devoted
to a two-game series with the Oak Ridge
outht, then after a rest on Sunday, the
Wildcats will journey up to Winston to
conquer “Coach Bill’s” new charges, the
Carolina Tarheels.

New York University is beginning her
season with a tour of North Carolina.
They play Monday and Tuesday at Trin-
ity, Wednesday at Chapel Hill, Thurs-
day the Wildcats at Davidson, and N. C.
State at Raleigh on Friday. Not much
dope is obtainable at the present time on
the Northern ball tossers, but their
showing the first of the week will tell
us something of what to expect. It is a
safe guess to say that they will be an
accomplished outht, and the Wildcats
will have to fight tooth and nail to over-
come them. [t is Davidson’s first en-
counter with a Northern University, and
all efforts will be made to take the vis-
itors into camp. The advance line-up as
sent down by their manager reads as
follows: Captain Delaney, p.; Hirchfield,
p.: Draffen, ¢.; Nelson, tb.; Liss, 2b.;
Baker, 3b.; Flynn, ss.; Weinheimer, If.;
Goeller, cf.; Robertson, rf.

Oak Ridge is a prep school, but the
baseball teams that they put out are of
a calibre fit for any college varsity.
Every year they give us a battle royal
and this season they will come with an
even firmer determination to carry off
the honors.

Interest centers, however, with the

contest at Winston on Easter Monday
with the diamond artists of Chapel Hill.
Coach Bill Fetzer has begun his work
over there this spring and is putting out
a team that bids fair to be one of the
