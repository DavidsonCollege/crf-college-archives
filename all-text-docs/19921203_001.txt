Students Upset Over Exam Changes
Self-Scheduled Period Shortened to 5 Days

By Mandy Curtis

The 1992 fall exam period, a
changed schedule from past years,
has sparked confusion and con-
cern among many students at
Davidson. This year’s calendar
includes new “optional class days”
and an exam period shortened to
five days.

The changes are results of an
evolutionary process that began
four years ago.

Davidson switched from tri-
mesters to semesters for the ‘88-
*89 school year. The different se-
mester system necessitated a
change in exam schedules. The
Executive Committee of the Fac-
ulty, consisting of seven faculty
members and three administrators,
determined the calendar for that
year as well as years since. In that
first year students were given seven
days for exams in the fall and six
and a half days in the spring.

In ‘89- ‘90 and *90- ‘91 the
exam schedule was changed to six

and a half days for exams in both
the fall and spring semesters. Af-
ter classes ended, there was the
traditional reading day, and exams
began the next day.

The exam period was reduced
again last year to five and a half
days with a reading day.

In the current academic year
there are only five days for exams.

According to Dr. Benjamin
Klein, the Acting Dean of Faculty
and a member of the Executive
Committee of the Faculty, thecom-
mittee “didn’t know what to ex-
pect” in the first year of the semes-
ter change. The committee felt
that they wanted to give the stu-
dents “‘an adequate amountoftime”
for exams, but as the years went
along the committee had more ex-
perience and realized that ‘“‘less time
was needed.” “Tt is clear that the
feeling [of the committee] is that
five days is enough,” stated Klein.

Back in the years when there
were seven or six and a half days

for exams, there were still seniors
around who needed to fulfill the
requirement of 35 courses for
graduation. According to Klein,

because many of those students

still had five classesa semester, the

‘committee allowed for the ex-

tendednumber ofexam days. Now
there is “virtually no one who has
five exams,” said Klein.

Klein went on to explain that

convenience and monetery inter-
ests are the two main concerns in
making the calendar and exam
schedule. “It is a perceived desire
of the students that they wantto get
home for Christmas; however, we
want them to do well on their ex-
ams,” said Klein. Economically,
the more days there are of exams
the longer the dorms need to stay
open and the meals need to be
served, according to Klein.
Optional class days are a new
addition to this year’s calendar.

Ukrop's
Triple OT
Goal Beats

i N.C. State

By Bruce Balestier

The Davidson soccer team
completed what is likely the long-
est path ever taken to the NCAA
Soccer Tournament’s Final Four
Sunday afternoon in Raleigh with
a 1-0 win over #3 N.C. State. The
win over the Wolfpack took the
better part of three overtime peri-
ods, but was a comparative relief
after games in the first two rounds
of the tournament, against UNC-
Charlotte and Coastal Carolina, in

to decide the outcome after-90
minutes of regulation and.60 min-
utes of overtime produced a tie
score. Davidson (17-4-5) will meet
San Diego (18-4) in the second
semifinal game Friday afternoon
at Richardson Field.

The game-winning goal came
at 131:47 and culminated a pro-
longed assault by the Wildcats on
the N.C. State goal in the first
sudden-death overtime period.
Matt Spear’s free kick from the
right corner of the field deflected
off a couple of players in a clump
in front of the goal and bounced to
Rob Ukrop, whosentit into the net
with a low shot from five yards
out, then took off at a full sprint to
meet a swarm of Davidson fans
who vaulted a fence to join the
players in an_ on-field
celebration.” The ball just dropped
rightthere,” said Ukrop, “and I just
hit it as hard as T:could on the
ground.”

It was an improbable conclu-
sion to the game for Ukrop, who
eluded a crowd of N.C. State de-
fenders for what seemed like the
first time all afternoon. Wolfpack
coach George Tarantini, figuring
that Davidson could not win if
Ukrop was not a factor, assigned
two, and sometimes three, defend-
ers to mark him constantly, and
that strategy held Ukrop, the
nation’s leading scorer with 31
goals and 72 points, to just two
