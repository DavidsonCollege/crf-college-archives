OUR POSITION,

For four years now ‘Pre Davivson-
IAN has existed; and yet when we pause
and think a moment, we realize that
there has been something more than
mere existence. Pick up the four issues
for any corresponding dates in the last
four years and it will not be hard to
trace a certain growth, a progress. “This
advance is not due to any superior in-
tellizence on the part of succeeding staffs
but to the fact that thru age comes a
sense of greater stability and assurance.
It is due to a wider experience resulting
from the profiting by, and adding to, the
general experience and knowledge of
former staffs and editors; to increased
circulation and advertising space in a
six page instead of a four page publica-
tion; and to the keeping up with college
journalism, which has without doubt
grown and advanced in the last four
or five years. Thus we are deeply in-
debted to former editorial staffs, and it
is up to us at least to equal their stand-
ards.

OUR AIMS.

In a year of such uncertainty as this
is sure to be, it is difficult to say what
we will do. And yet, disregarding any-
thing unforeseen, we are safe in stating
our aims: to publish the representative
news of the college in an attractively
written six page sheet; to make the pa-
per a channel thru which students and
alumni may express their opinions and
ideas, thus promoting interest and thot
in all connected with the institution;
in an impartial way to uphold those
things which are for the best interests
of the college, and to condemn that
which is detrimental and harmful; to
promote a better spirit of fellowship on
the campus; and last but not least, to
draw the alumni closer together and to
keep them in touch with their Alma
Mater by giving them in these columns
a true account of all the activities of
college life.

All this THe Davinsontan staff aims
to do, and it is hoped that the alumni,
the faculty, and the student body mav
so co-operate this year that it may be
the most successful the college has ever
known.

Drill in the afternoon, in some re-
spects, is a decided improvement over

that in the early morning. It should
add materially to the interest as it will
make. it possible to have open field man-
euvers and sham battles, and give an op-
portunity to go thry the ceremonies of
retreat every afternoon.

that it will conflict with baseball, track
and other activities. Men having such
conflicts from baseball will of course be
excused from drill. Yet there are quite
a few going out for track, and as there
are a number interested in the rumored
spring tennis tournament, it has been
questioned whether drill would climi-
nate these. There is no reason why it
should, as from dinner time to five-fif-
teen is surely time econugh to get all the
exercise anyone wants. But should anvy-
one disagree with this, it has been sug-
gested that drill be held directly «fter
supper, and by a concerted action of the
students it could no doubt be arranged
to have it at this hour.

This Easter was decidedly different
from that first Easter Sunday cighteen
hundred and eighty-nine years ago. And
yet that same old struggle against ab-
colutism is still going on.

Here's to the new Y. M. C. A. cabi-
net as it comes into office, and may it
have a most successful year.

fully on a table in the gym now since

better hanging up in the Library or

As this issue goes to press the Da-
vidson warriors are setting out on a
warpath into South Carolina, Georgia,
and Florida. Watch their home-coming

It's a yood thing the Davidson bat-
talion doesn't have to depend on the
rapid completion of the trench below
Mr. Hill’s house for protection from
the ‘Boches.

If everyone would turn up their clocks
an hour, keep the same schedules as be-
fore, and forget about the sun, there
would be much less discussion, loss of
time, and trouble.

The Lyceum last Saturday night easi-
lv came up to the other numbers of this
year and concluded probably one of the
best courses that has been on the Hill
for several years.

WAR FOR HUMANITY.

War, in a good cause, is not the
greatest evil which a nation can suffer.
War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest
of things; the decayed and degraded
state of moral and patriotic — fecling
which thinks nothing worth a war is
worse. When a people are used as mere
human instruments for firing cannon or
thrusting bayonets, in the service for
selfish purposes of a master, such war
degrades a people. A war to protect
other human beings against tyrannical
injustice; a war to give victory to their
own ideas of right and good, and which
is their own war, carried on for an hon-
est purpose by their free choice. is often
the means of their regeneration. A man
who has nothing which he is willing to
fight for, nothing which he cares more
about’ tan he does about his personal
safety, is a miserable creature, who has
no chance of being free, unless made and
kept so by the exertions of better men
than himself. As long as justice and in-
justice have not terminated their ever-

advantage of having drill at this hour is

more ago, but it might have been writ-

DR. MARTIN ATTENDS
SYNOD IN GREENSBORO

A special call meeting of the North
Coralina Synod was held in Greensboro
on last Thursday with seventy-five dele-
gates present, the purpose of the meeting
being to discuss the question of the coali-
tion of Peace Institute and Queens Col-
lege. There was much discussion and
upon a motion of Dr. W. J. Martin it
was decided to accept the property of
these two colleges for the Synod. A
motion that there be inaugurated a wom-
en’s department at Davidson that would
give an “A-1” education was made. This
caused much comment, but was finally
voted down. The final action of the
Svnod was to accept the property of these
two institutions and to combine them in
one institution at the most advantageous
location in the State. The committee
was authorized to ask for bids from cities
in this State to decide upon the location.
The boards of trustees of these two col-
leges were instructed to continue the
operations of the institutions at their
own risk, if they so desired, until this

QUELQUES
AUTOBIOGRAPHIES

“Je suis Juillet. J’ai trente et un
jours. Les Romains m'ont mis sur le
calendrier et m’ont donne le nom que je
porte a la memoire de Jules Cesar.
Ceres me donne des fluers, des fruits, et
des legumes. J'ai apporte aux Etats-
Unis a la Declaration de 1|’Independ-
ance; a la France, la Revolution et la
Republique. Et quand je reviens encore
jespere apporter la paix aux malheu-
reuses nations, les Etats-Unis, la France,
la Russie, I'Angleterre. La Serbie, la
Belgique. et meme a la Turquie et a
l’Allemagne.”

“Je suits un bon chat blanc. Je suis
mort deja huit fois. Quand j’avais deux
mois une brique m’est tombee sur le cou.
et me l’est casse. On m'a jete deux fois
dans le fleuve. Mon maitre et moi,
nous ¥ sommes tombes deux fois. Une
fois on m’a mis dans un sac, et m’a
Jaisse sur le chemin de fer. -C’etait la
une terrible facon de quitter la vie. Un
jour quelques chiens m’ont chasse, et je
suits mort de peur et de fatigue. On
m'a derohe deux fois la vie, moyennant
le chloroforme. Je vis a present dans
un etat de peur continuelle, parceque,
maintenant. je n'ai plus qu'une seule
fois a mourir.”

WEBSTER'S STAND.

1 was born an American; T live an
American; IT shall die an American; and
1 intend to perform the duties incumbent .
upon me in that character to the end of
my career. I mean to do this with ab-
colute disregard of personal —conse-
quences. What are the personal conse-
quences? What is the individual man,
with all the good or evil that may betide
him, in. comparison with all the good or
evil that may betide a great country;
and in the midst of great transactions
which concern that country’s fate? Let
the consequences be what they will, Iam
careless. No man can suffer too much or

no man can fall too soon, if he suffer, or
if he fall in the defense of the liberties
and constitution of his country.—Daniel

Webster.
