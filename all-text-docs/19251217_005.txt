Yuletide Interest Among College Boys

The following are a few of the choicest |

a few simple gifts quite within the reach of
your kind generosity and trust that you will
see fit to indulge my whims,

I want you to bring me a nice Ford coupe
(one hand drive), a season ticket to all the |
musical comedies in Charlotte, a six. foot |
telescope for use at the same, a gross cartons |
of Herbert Tarreyton fags, a diamond stud, |

have the soldiers red. I also want a little
toy cannon and a kiddie kar to ride to chapel
on. I like candy, nuts, fruit, and other
things, too. If you have any scraps left over,
why just bring them by my house.

P. S.—Don't forget the pop gun.

Your little friend,
Squads Joyner.
Dear Santa Claus:

I am awaiting your arrival with a keen
sense of anticipation mixed with a few shots

guns. I have made several trips to the golf
course, though, and have put my initials in
every tree, standing 250 paces away.

My radio is working good since I bought
a few steel jackets and made some ventila-
tion holes in the panel. It’s just a 14-tube
set, but I think I heard station BULL in
Charlotte about a month ago.

IN APPRECIATION OF
THE SERVICES OF
MRS. OREN MOORE

After the close of football season,
few if any of even the most inter-
ested ones, pause to think of words
of appreciation and thanks that are
due to many who have worked
faithfully forthe betterment of the
team throughout the entire season.
One of these individuals, so vitally
interested in the welfare of the
Wildcat fighters of gridiron fame,
is Mrs. Oren Moore of Charlotte.

Before each game of the fall that
she was unable to attend, her ab-
sence due only to the fact that the
contest was staged too far from her
home, a long distance telephone
message of* encouragement and
cheer was received bythe team from
Mrs. Moore. At every game that
she witnessed, she presented a box
of chewing gum to the members of
the squad. At the close of the long
gruelling fall of practice and games,
Mrs. Moore gave the team sever-
al cakes and two cartons of cigar-
ettes.

Last spring at the close of the
month of practice she gave the
team dainties and smokes and
emitted words of praise and en-
couragement. Dr. Oren Moore,
when he attended Davidson was
one of the outstanding men of the
campus, in his Senior year being
President of the Athletic Associa-
tion, and a member of various ath-
letic teams.
