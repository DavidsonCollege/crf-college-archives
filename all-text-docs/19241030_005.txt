When Conflagration : Starts at Early.
Morning Hour—Students Respond

“What was all the disturbance the
other night, about three o'clock?” “Was
ita night shirt parade?” “Why I didn’t ,
hear any bell ring.” “Freshman, you
didn't go to the fire?” :

Last Friday morning about three
o'clock, the night-watchman discovered
a small fire in the Phi Hall. The night-
watchman being a new man, did not
know to ring the bell to arouse the stu-

dents. He hurried over to Rumple
where the following conversation fol-
lowed. “Excuse me gentlemen, is there

a little something around here a fellow
could get to put out a little bit of fire.”
By this time Shorty Howell and Bob
Kimzey were awake. “Go ring that bell
and wake up the students.” The night-
watchman rang the bell, but did not ring
the regular fire-alarm, There were many
students that thought this was a trick.
But as the news of a fire spread from
Rumple down Dormitory Row, the stu-
dents responded to the call.
There could have been some suspicion
to whether this a night shirt
parade or not. The students in response
to the call came as soon as they could
get their eyes open enough to see. Thus
it is useless to describe the attire of the
Fire Department.

as was

It was very fortunate that the night-
watchman discovered the fire in the nick
of time. The students arrived with
buckets and hose; while others brought
the chemicals; the fire was brought un-
der control, with Captain George, acting
as fire chief. As the the fire was put out
with chemicals, no water was used. The
k. O. T. C. department collected the fire
fighting equipment and carried it back
to the fire house.

There was some damage done to the
Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity Hall, where
the first started. The floor was burned,
and furniture damaged to a large extent.

FURMAN FIGHTS HARD

the three yards, and the Purple Hurricane,
as no other team does, realizes the factor he
has proven and is proving in the Davidson
line. Every man on the Davidson team de-
serves great credit.

Furman used almost a one-man team. Her-
long,in the backfield, was used incessantly.
He was used to hurl passes, to kick and to
carry the ball. Three times straight he
would be used, and twice in every four at-
tempts the quarterback would call upon’
number eleven, Herlong’s number, to carry
the ball. He was a driving power and gained
ground consistently for the Purple Hurri-
cane,

The team from Greenville won the-toss up
xnd chose to let the Wildcats kick against a
strong eastern wind. Against this Black
kicked off 46 yards, and the punt was re-
turned 18. Failing to gain, Furman punted,
and Davidson rushed the ball down the field,
making two first downs and bringing the
ball 17 yards from the goal. Instéjd_ of
kicking a field goal, a pass was attémpted
which failed, and the ball went over to Fur-
man, Furman made two first downs and
kicked. With the ball on Davidson's own
32-yard line Leggette’s punt was blocked by
Brown, and was recovered by Tilghman, end,
who ran for a touchdown. It seemed as if |
the entire Furman team broke through this
time, several players traifing ‘at the heels of
Tilghman. Furman failed to kick goal,
Score, Furman 6, Davidson 0. After another
kick off Furman was penalized, the ball was
on the latter's 14-yard line, but Herlong
kicked safely from danger. Davidson soon
kicked and Furman fumbled, Davidson re-
covering. The quarter ended at this point.

The second quarter opened with the ball in
Davidson's possession on Furman’'s 30-yard
line, but a pass failed and Leggette kicked
over the goal line for a touchback. Failing |
to gain, Furman punted and shortly after-
ward Leggette again punted over the goal
line for a touchback. This was kept up
until Davidson was finally eight yards from |
the goal, but two passes failed and the ball
changed hands. The half ended with the ball
in Furman’s possession on her own 27-yard |
line. |

Davidson opened the second half with a!
45-yard kickoff to Herlong who returned 10.)
Soon after Herlong made 35 yards over Fyr-
man's leit tackle. He was a hard man ‘to
stop on this play. Te game consisted of an
exchange of punts until Hunt got away |
with a brilliant play,’and received a second |
pass for 20 yards. The quarter ended with

Four Representatives of Davidson-

Journalists

As representatives of the Dazvidsonian,
C. F. Smith, managing editor and W. E.
Milton, asssistant managing editor of
that paper, leave today to attend the fall
convention of the North Carolina Col-
legiate Press Asociation at Greensboro.
W. H. Branch and C. F. Monk also go.
The meeting to be held at Greensboro
College for Women opens tonight with
an informal reception given by the staff
of the G. C. W. paper, who are hosts
to delegates from fourteen North State
institutions. The pressmen will hold ses-
sion for three days following.

The N.C. C. P. A. has been closely link-
ed with the activities of the Davidson
Colege publications. The first president
an editor of the Dazvidsonian and
since then other Davidson men have held
offices in the organization. The D. C.
periodicals have derived no little bene-
fit from this co-operation with other
newspapers and magazines in the same
field besides having helped to raise the
standard of college journalism in North
Carolina.

A special feature of the convention will
be the round-table discussion groups on
the various phases of work on the pub-
lications. In these an opportunity will
be given newspaper editors, magazine
editors, business managers, and the heads
of the various departments to exchange
ideas and methods related especially to
their particular line of effort.

It will be remembered that at the meet-

ing of the association at Elon College
last spring, the Davidsonian was desig-
nated the best college newspaper in
North Carolina, and that the Davidson
College Magazine was selected among the
best three in the state. C. M.S. Mell

chief and business manager respectively

of the  Davidsonian attended the | con-

vention and were present when their
paper received the honor,

The Junior Metrophilian Literary Soci-
/ety met last Wednesday evening at nine
o'clock, the second meting since its or-
ganization, This was the first meeting
for which a regular program had been
prepared.

An exceptionally good program = was
presented, considering that this was the
first time some of the men had been on
the program of a literary society. B. ¢
Campbell gave some very interesting
current events, and H. T. Powell gave
a fine declamation. The query was: Re-
solved, That the Five" corporations
should be aranted exclusive rights to
control radio broadcasting, The affirma-
tive was upheld by Guiton Smith and
Martin. On the negative side
were Rod MeRae and Wallace Bradford,
The negative was given the decision, the
iudges voting 2 to 1.

body behind it, and doing efficient
work.

Special ‘Sunday Schools
Class Open t to Student

| Class to Be Conducted ; in Novel and
Interesting Manner :

This year, as in previous years, a Sun-
day School class especially for college
\students has been organized. The
sons are adapted to college men. Four
members of the faculty are to be the
teachers. Three of them are Doctor
Shewmake, Professor Currie, and Dr. J.
M. Douglas. The fourth member will be
either Professor Porter or Professor
Wood. These will rotate in the above
named order so that the burden of lead-

les-

ling will not fall too heavy on any one

teacher and so that each Sunday the stu-
dents may expect something new and
interesting. About three weeks ago the
hour of meeting was charged from the
afternoon to the morning. The primary
object of this change was to find a time
more suitable to the students. The topic
for study each time is presented in the
form of a lecture covering the lesson.
This plan of teaching was adopted as
it was thought to be more suitable to the

imen of the college.

Every possible effort is being made to
stimulate interest in the work. A hearty
invitation is extended by the superin-
tendent, Prof. J. W. McConnell to each
man in Davidson College.

It is deeply regretted by all the David-
son students to learn that Wm. H.
Dodge, of Jacksonville, Fla., had to drop

‘out of .college on account of sickness,

after having been in the infirmary ever
since his arrival at Davidson. His
mother. Mrs. J. W. Dodge, came wp af-
ter him Friday and they returned home
Saturday. It is earnestly hoped by all
that he will soon be well again and will
return to college.
