A Re-Examination

The basis of a firm and persuasive editorial policy
lies in the ability to change our minds. Last week we
backed the establishment of night exams. Then to our
amazement, the faculty was persuaded and passed
the proposal. If only we could applaud.

Alas, new facts present themselves, and we got
around to looking at some of the old ones. And facts,
you know, cannot be ignored. Thus, we must change
horses in the middle of the stream. We request the
faculty to reconsider their hasty decision.

On Monday morning we received a letter from the
State Highway Patrol. Accompanying a subpoena for
traffic violations was a report revealing the dramatic
increase of student deaths on the highways after
examination periods. ;

We wish you could share the horror of reading case
histories of students found clutching. steering wheels
in the tops of long-leaf pines while muttering formulas
for cost-benefit analysis. «

As the Patrol pointed out, what will happen if we
unleash Davidson students on the highways after a
day of three exams (and if students take two in one
day, what’s going to stop them from taking three)?

Imagine a Davidson student weaving down I-85 af-
ter three hours examining the influence of Christ in
Western culture, three hours criticizing the economic
proposals of Gerald Ford’s energy proposals, three
hours cataloging the sources of ‘‘The Wasteland,”’ six-
teen cups of Taster’s Choice with White Cross sac-
charine, and three Slaterburgers.

Can the faculty allow students to destroy them-
selves thusly? Highway carnage must be avoided at
all costs.

And if this isn’t enough, once we thought about it,
what does Mrs. Kimmel know about nocturnal ex-
cursions? She doesn’t even know when Ben should go
to bed. We hate to consider his health as the years roll
on.

Student safety should override all academic
cushions. If we’re to have any students left to take
exams, night exams must be avoided. ;

Besides, we’ve got better things to do at night. Ask
Mrs. Kimmel.

Spencer's
Intuition

We applaud President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. for
declining to raise 1975-76 tuition
costs. As Dr. Spencer
remarked, ‘“‘Let’s be reasonable
about what we offer here at
Davidson. @

‘‘We’re close to pricing our-
selves out of the market
already. You know. we’re not
worth $4,400; even I know we’re
not worth that much. How many
kids, with parents earning
$20,000 or more, do you think H.
Edmunds can find anyway?”’

Furthermore, it is about time
that the administration came to
grips with the problems facing
low-income students at David-
son.

It seems obvious to us that the
problem could be immediately
solved by refusing to admit low-
income students to Davidson.

Just think, we could convert
all need. grants into athletic
scholarships. You’ve got to ad-
mit the’ basketball program
qualifies as a substantial need
case.

Terry Views Program Housing
As Viable New Mode Of Input

Project housing was con-
sidered dead at Davidson earlier
this week, but seems to have
made a substantial come-back
with the genesis of two new
projects by interested students.

Dean of Students Will H. Terry
commented: ‘There was a time
when project housing was a
viable and useful mode of stu-
dent input into the college and
the community. That just isn’t
true anymore.”

That comment came last
week, before two different
student groups approached
Terry, with their plans for
projects, one involving an
outreach into the community,
the other a plan for co-
educational habitation.

“Two very interesting and
startling projects have presen-
ted themselves to me, ” said
Terry. ‘‘A group approached me
on Tuesday with a plan to use
Grey house as a base for
reclaiming the Davidson com-
munity for the college. I cannot
say. much more now because the
administrative processes of
decision are just beginning.”

The program for reclamation
of Davidson was presented to
Terry by four members of the
Davidson College rifle team,
four members ofthe rugby
team, three ROCS, and Craig
Crosswhite. It proposes to use

‘a special brand of terrorism”’
to expand the current holdings
of Davidson College, according
to Terry.

“We have always had the kind
of firepower necessary to pull
this off, I’m glad that now we
have the student interest. If
Crosswhite recovers from his
unfortunate bout with rabies, we

‘ will have enough roughnecks to

get this thing started.

“After the initial offensive,
however, we will want to recruit
more students to help us out,
people who are _ ruggedly
Christian, show leadership
potential, and aren’t afraid to
continually advance. Holding
our position means nothing, we
want to constantly advance to
take up ground and give none of
it back.

“If everything goes as it

should, those ‘founded by
Presbyterians in 1837’ signs
should be 30 miles apart in time
for the college’s  sesqui-
centennial celebration,” said
Terry.
Another plan for project
housing has been submitted, and
it is of a little more sensitive
nature, involving co-habitation
of males and females.

Scotty Nichols, Director of
Student Housing, said: ‘Boys
and girls naturally want to get
together and by letting them live

Seriously. wd

The experiment of co-
habitation was first attempted
at Harrad College and more
recently at @berlin. Both
colleges feel that the experiment
is a success. The only real
probem they have had has been
monetary, involving the expense
of mailing . ‘morning remin-
ders’’ to the women.

These reminders ‘are con-
sidered necessary by both
schools. At Oberlin the reminder
reads “‘Time to take your pill’.
The message is the same at
Harrad but is printed on the
back of a post-card picturing a
dozen broken hen-eggs.

“The competition for places
will be very selective. We will
probably use North Main House
because the shower facilities
there are larger and frankly,
more accomodating. Also Will
seems to want Grey House for
something--I don’t know what,”’
said Nichols. oy

“T will go with our group and
am lucky to get in on the ground
fldor of these plans.

“T intend to enjoy myself. My
position will be less than ad-
ministrative,”’ continued
Nichols.
