YOUNG MINISTER
PROVES POPULAR

Rev. Peter Marshall Makes Strong
Appeal To Davidson
Student Body

ip ——».

If you are simple, you will receive
religion; if you are wise, you will be-
lieve religion,” stated Rev. Peter Mar-
shall in his Sunday morning sermon,
“The Church Asks Youth, So What?”
at the Davidson College Presbyterian
Church, February 10.

Rev. Peter Marshall, in his Sunday
morning sermon, stated that there are
. mistaken ideas held by a great many
People, in regard to religion. It is con-
sidered, he continued, an achievement
when young people evince any interest
in religion, The Church “regards relig-
ton as a dope which naturally makes its
appeal to the middle-aged who are think-
ing of more serious things and to the
aged who in the weakness of their last
days, seek something on which to lean.
There are also the timorous souls who
have lost the daring of their courage and
require a spiritual sedative to soothe their
jangling nerves,

You say you cannot identify yourself
with the Church and Her faith because
of the supernatural elements in Christi-
anity. “Is it on scientific grounds? Is it
because of the supposed contradiction of
natural law?

The late Mr. Edison said: “We do not
know one-seven-billionth part of one per
cent about anything.” Are we not presum-
ing rather much when we say dogmati-
cally that so and so is impossible? And,
having been told by the ignorant that
science and religion are-not to be recon-
ciled, you assume that evolution eliminates
God,

Rey. Marshall pointed out, I might be
impressed if-you-had-as-much knowledge
of that to which you object, as you have
of the natural law which you worship.
You say you can’t accept miracles and
other supernatural elements in the Bible,
and the chances are you do not know
much about them.

Shall the Church surrender Her beliefs
because modern young people cannot ac-
cept them or shall She throw overboard
these traditions that have been cherished
through all these centuries?

Young people, said Rev. Marshall, the
Church knows about the tears and the
broken hearts which the world has no
interest. From her clinic, standing
among Her children are some who are
all burned out—spent in the twenties
with disillusioned, disappointed and des-
paired. ‘The Church wants to know;
“So What?”

In the murderer's cell, the hungry souls
call.for the Church and ask for a humble
Prayer. But in health and bright lights,
only the music of a rhumba can be heard
because they have no need for the
Church; “So What?”

In concluding his speech, Dr. Marshall
stated the Church is formed first by the
simple, that great mass of men and wo-
men whose ignorance is more illumined
than the doctrines of learned men. They
prefer to be instructed by the angles or
the ambassadors of God.-

Then the Church is found by the wise,
the real seekers after truth. If you are
simple, you will receive religion; if you
are wise,,you will believe religion.

John Douglas introduced Rev. Marshall
at the evening Vesper service. Rev. Mar-
shall’s address was “The Cock Crew.”
The last supper was over. It was a sad
meal at which the disciples had lost their
appeties. Christ had spoken of betrayal.
He had plainly said that one of their
number would betray Him and that He
would die.

The disciples asked in turn: “Lord, is
it 1?” And they heard Peter say:
“Though all men shall be offended, yet
will I never be offended.” ‘Those seated
around the table thrilled at the brave,
confident statement on the part of the

~ impetuous. Peter,

But now, the meal is over—but some-
thing of its atmosphere lingered with
them still. It was a feeling that could
not be shaken off.

They climbed the hill-side and reached
the Garden of Gethsemane where among
the olive trees they found a peace in
which to muse and rest. In a short hour
they were to witness the fulfillment of a
prophecy made that evening and of
prophecies made by prophets of old.

Dr. Marshall continued the series of
events leading up to Peter’s denial of
Christ.

; PETITION TO TRUSTEES

(Continued from Page 1)
the authorities have at the same time
sought to prevent a reprehensible indul-
gence in completely unsupervised dancing,
which would necessarily be the refuge of
the students; and they have recognized
Davidson dances off the Davidson cam-
pus under appointed faculty supervision.
In doing this they have apparently had
the good intentions of letting the situa-
tion find its own keel hoping that for-
bearance from further intervention would
amount to leaving the whole matter by
natural process to right itself. But
things have not turned out fortunately.

And here we would make it plain that
we are absolutely not criticising the ac-
tion of the authorities because their ac-
tion was at the time certainly very ex-
pedient; nor are we laying any blame
to those who supervise the dances, for
they have supervised them well.

We are, however, laying direct blame
to the situation itself, to the bare fact
that there is a foregathering of students
in Charlotte at certain regular periods
of the year. It would make little
difference if some other activity were
substituted for dancing, because very
few of the attendant evils are actually
connected with the dances themselves.
If there were periodic illustrated lectures
given in Charlotte which a certain per-
centage of the student body was re-
quired to attend the same evils would
most probably exist.

In the first place, we find drinking al-
most a universal evil connected with
Davidson dances. We say “connected”
very advisedly because only a negligible
amount of drinking occurs among those
dancing. But a great many students find
that the occasion of a Davidson dance in
Charlotte is an excellent opportunity to
accompany those who are going to the
dance, and under the cover of a general
exodus, to visit immoral resorts and to
drink. “Certainly it must be concluded
that a large proportion of those who go
to Charlotte never reach the dance floor,
since dancing under the influence of
liquor is rare, while it has been estimated
by count that 60 per cent of the upper
classmen, who have been in Charlotte
during a set of dances, has been Seen in
the act of drinking. In this @stimate,
no suppositions were accepted; those
were counted only who had been seen.

Another evil we find connected ‘with
Davidson dances in Charlotte is the traf-
fic hazards. No serious injury has ever
been sustained by students during a set
of dances; but there have been several
incidents in which automobiles driven by
Davidson students were crowded off the
road into ditches during the journey to
a Charlotte dance. And we think we

do not go far wrong in ascribing the non-
occurrence of serious accidents to the
kindness of Providence when we re-
member that those going to dances in
Charlotte go in very much overcrowded
automobiles along a necessarily congested
route. This traffic hazard, we cannot help
thinking, amounts to a serious condition
indeed.

Still another evil which is probably
more insidious than apparent is the pres-
ence of undesirable outsiders at David-
|son dances held in Charlotte, strange
men are accompanied by strange women;
and both are often of unsavory charac-
ter. No wonder some observers claim
that Davidson students are not in the
habit of asking nice girls to their dances.
We .ourselves doubt that they do invite
indecent women; but the presence of un-
wanted persons of both sexes can hardly
either raise the standards of the dances,
or be an inducement to the students for
asking their sisters or the friends of their
sisters. \

When one considers the
above outlined, one can hardly fail to
see that instead of encouraging an im-
provement of the dance situation, the
authorities, by their attitude, have virtu-
ally, though unwittingly, connived at a
deplorable and intolerable state of af-
fairs. We are not blaming our elders
for acting in a way which they have
thought to be for our best; but we are
wondering if they realize the exact re-
sults of what they have done; and we are
making a plea for better things.

If, however, dances were
held on the Davidson campus they would
be strictly Davidson dances, invited at-
fairs, and not “script”. ‘Thus outsiders
would be eliminated. The dances would
be far more democratic, since they would
be cheaper and because of the great re-
duction in the expense of putting them
on and consequently open to a larger
number of students.. And the traffic haz-
ards would be eliminated. Furthermore,
students would have no readymade ex-
cuse to sally forth; the presence of alum-
ni with small real respect for their alma
mater but with great capacities for drink
would be far more easily eliminated; and,
finally, drinking among students would
be under complete control. This last is

no idle hope, but is easily seen to be
true when one considers that the
student council which has reduced drink-
ing on the campus to a minimum would
control drinking at dances on the David-
son campus.

same

And yet—it may be said—it dancittg
is in itself a wrong thing there can be
no justification whatever for its being
practiced on ground which has been held
as a sanctuary exclusively for the good

and spiritual things pertaining to the
Church. We cannot, and do not wish to
gainsay this argument. Yet we cannot
help stating that though we realize our
own shortcomings we do not feel our-
selves to be far different from all the
youth gone before us, which attended
Davidson in earlier days, and which
formed its traditions, and growing up
formed the traditions of the church. We
believe ourselves to be clean, steadfast
young people. We would not be prideful,
but we credit ourselves with a degree of
spirituality. We do not believe that we
are stooping to do an indecent thing by
dancing; and we do not believe that we
are lowering ourselves by taking part. in
it. Popular opinions are usually thought
to be ill-considered; yet we cannot help
acceding, after due consideration, to the
popular opinion that dancing has become
a conventional form of social activity.
Of parents members of the
senior class who were questioned as to
whether they would have sent their sons
to Davidson had dancing at the time been
allowed eighty-six per cent replied in the
affirmative. It seems indeed that a large
number of us are not gainsaying any
parental guidance in holding our opinions.

sixty of

Ugly things have been said about the
motives «which a majority of Davidson
students have in asking girls to dances.
We only know that a large number of
these girls are blood-relations and cer-
tainly within our own social sphere; and
we feel that though a few instances may
have warranted these assertions, those
instances were vastly encouraged by ex-
isting conditions.

It has een the
campus would be as vicious as those in
Charlotte. Again we are left with noth-
ing to answer, we can only reply that the
activities of the Students Policies Union
during the last months have
motivated by the deepest sincerity, and
as such can hardly be said to have been

said that dances on

few been

participated in by young men who would
vainly endeavor to replace one evil by
another, We are not working for
change which would in some way bring
about added zest to evil-doing. We find
ourselves beseiged by undesirable social
circumstances, and if given the chance to

effect a remedy we can be trusted to do
our best in attempting to achieve that
remedy,

There are though ~ almost
meagre physical facilities for dancing on
the Davidson campus at present. And so
we petition the Board of Trustees to
allow’ us a trial period for dancing on
the DavidsonSeampus under whatever
supervision the Board of Trustees may
deem proper. ns

MASQUERS PLAN
PLAY FOR MARCH

“Three Taps At Twelve,” A Mys-
tery, Is Chosen By Players
As Next Production ~

The Red and Black Masquers, local
dramatic organization, will present
second play of the year sometime during
March. The title of the play is “Three
Taps At Twelve,” and it will be directed
by Edward Donigan.

The play, which is a murder mystery,
is presented in three acts. The murder
is committed in the first act and the re-
maining two acts are devoted to the solu-
tion of the crime. Practically all of the
characters are under suspicion for hav-
ing committed the crime, and it is not
until the very end that the real murderer
is caught. ‘The solution to the murder is
very startling and the suspence adds
much to the interest of the play.

The cast of characters is as follows:

IVEY-GRAM

RENEWAL

Although the Ivey-gram has not ap-
peared in the last few issues of the
Davidsonian, this renewal carries some
style hints for the “collegiate.” As
stated before, it is the purpose of /vey’s
to keep Davidson men posted on just
what is being worn by the style leaders
of the country. The items of clothing
mentioned in the following paragraphs
are merely suggestions, but these sug-
gestions and many other items may be
secured from /vey’s at what college men
consider reasonable prices!
FOR THE FORMAL

Since Mid-Winters are only three or
four days away, /vey’s suggests that you
take stock of your wardrobe for the
dances, especially for Friday night. Re-
member that tuxedo shirts should carry
two studs these days and that gray pearl
studs are mighty stylish with tails. As
for bow ties, /vey’s has both black and
white, and Hickok for both
tux and tails.

Freshmen Arouse Suspicion
Around Cemeteries, Hen-
houses, And Barnyards

Bow ties, suitcases, tux collars, white
shoes, dogs, autographed eggs, and light-
ed candles have recently made their ap-
pearance in the ranks of the Freshman
class, with the coming of informal fra-
ternity initiations.

Also noticeable among the red-cap-
men, not being confined to any one fra-
ternity, were dark circles under the eyes
pledges, an indicator that possibly
what goes under the eyes of the Stu-
dent Body is not all that happens to
neophytes during the much-dreaded in-
formal initiation.

of

One obvious omission this year from
alarm clocks draped around the necks of
the time-honored favorites was that to
the luckless freshmen. Some yearlings,
however, became quite conspicuous with
one white and one black shoes, while
others suffered many a dripping pocket
owing to undue pressure on hand-deco-
rated eggs.

One pledge group persisted in present-
ing all comers with toothpicks. accom-
panied by a puzzling speech, and if you
haven't heard, be sure to ask them the
reason for their lighted candles each
night.

People living near the local cemetery
have. reported strange flickerings seen
repeatedly at all hours of the. night
among thé stones, and of dark
crouching forms systematically moving
from grave to grave. A remarkable in-
crease in the number of freshmen walk-
ing toward Cornelius and Mooresville,
concerned with mysterious tabulations,
has also been observed.

Rural residents exercise especial cau-
tion in locking up the henhouse door,
each evening, but despite their efforts, the
barnyard population is on the decline;
Several cases of strayed horses and cows
have been reported, while dogs and cats
are at a premium due to the sudden de-
mand,
their
bulging pockets betray the presence of
several brands of cigarettes, chewing
gum, mints, cough drops, matches, tooth
candies.

Freshmen seem overloaded as

picks, gum drops, and penny
Strangely enough, said pockets are soon
emptied by encounters svith the “good

brothers,” and numerous treks to the
Stud Store result.
Another noticeable innovation is the

sudden deep respect shown by pledges as
they address their upperclassmen as
“Sir” and “Mr.” The faces of a few,
whose tribulations have not yet begun,
show deep lines of worry because of be-

wildering question: “When?” Others
show extreme fatigue, their question
probably being, in biblical terms: “How

long O Lord, how long?”

Becoming more numerous every day,
however, are those chosen few who re-
gain former dignity under their red hats
and strut about with beaming faces, ex-
hibiting new fraternity pins likewise
beaming on their chests, while-the -yet-
suffering ones enviously gaze through
sleepy eyes at those who have already
attained the fabled goal they hope some
day to reach.
