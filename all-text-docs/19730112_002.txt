Burts Introduces Alternative
Registration By Computer

Anea ‘much less inefficient

computerized course
scheduling system has been
devised to further ease

registration for classes. ac-
cording to Registrar Richard C
Burts Jr

A team of technical engineers
had been working with an IBM
1500 computer for the past nine
years to develop the new
system “It’s really quite sim-
ple. he said

“In all the systems we've had
in the past we've tried to make
the process as personal as
possible. This fall we en.
couraged students to spend ex-
tra time consulting with their
faculty advisors: consequently
95: percent of the student body
had to rearrange their
schedules

“Now we plan to solve these
problems by using the principle
of random order in every phase
of registration.”” Burts ex-
plained

“To avoid confusion. all
students will register at the
same timein either Eu Hall or
the basernent of Cannon Dor-
mitors

When he enters the
registra? om room. a student
will we handed 14 computer car-
ds The wurst three are tor his

ces for courses. and three are
for hus lunch order

We hope 10 get volunteers
from the SGA Senate to help
collect cards. pass out lunches

and take attendance ©

The method for filling out the
course preference cards is ‘a
bit tricky." Burts noted

“The student's name. first
name last. goes in the lower left

nd corner. We're omitting
‘dr.’ or ‘IIT’ or ‘Esqu. this vear.
unless the student has no mid-
dle initial. ‘

“In that case.” Burts con-
tinued. “the name goes in the
upper right hand corner. last
name first. with ‘Jr.’ or ‘III or
‘Esqu.” in red letters beneath
it.”

The maiden name of the
Student's mother goes on the
dotted line if the student has a
middle initial and on the solid
line if he doesn’t.

In either case. the month and
year of the student's last
typhoid booster shot goes in the
center of the card.

“Now, the name of a course
the student wants to take is
written vertically down the left
side of the card.” Burts said.
‘and the name of the professor
of the course down the right
side... .

“However, if the mother's
Maiden name 15 longer than SIN
letters, the sides aro reversed ¢

The other tive cards are tilled

method as too compheated
Besides. it really doesn’) have
very much to do with

Unce the cards have bern
Properl, completed. they will

be collected and filed for later
reference

“The computer will draw up a
random order of all the courses
to be offered. with each course
entered as many times as there
are spaces in the class.’ Burts
Said.

“The name of every student
will be entered three times and
another random order will be
drawn up.

“Then the computer will print
out one list of courses and one
list of student names. the two
will be pasted together side by
side, and members of the
Registrar's Office will cut the
double list into horizontal strips
and put together each student's
schedule.

He anticipates no problems
whatsoever and will abolish the
formal drop--add period.

SGA President Ralph Peeples
was pleased with the new
System. “It's simple and _ it's
lust," he said. “I can't believe it
happened at Davidson.’

He was nevertheless con-
cerned about the Senate's role
in the process “1 don't know

ches What does he think we
are. waiters or something? We

_“ould like to help with the
