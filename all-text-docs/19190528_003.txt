FIRST SHIPPING BOARD.

“We got this boat together in remark-
ably short time,” remarked Noah jubi-
lantly, as he stood off and surveyed the
ark.

“Yes,” replied Japeth. “All we haq
to do was to go ahead and build her o
wood. There hasn't been any steel con-
struction to stop and argue about.”—

THE IRISH COAST.

An officer on board a warship was
drilling his men.

“T want every man to lie on his back.
put, his legs in the air, and move them
as if he were riding a bicycle,” he ex-
plained. ‘“‘Now commence.”

After a short effort, one of the men
stopped.

“Why have you stopped, Murphy?”
asked the officer.

“If ye plaze. sir.” was the answer,
“Oi'm coasting.”"—Over Here.

A negro soldier in the trenches
showed up with a new pair of shoes.

“Where did you get dem shoes, nig-
ger?” asked his mate.

“I gotten des shoes from a Boche,”
was the reply.

Soon after this the first negro dis-
appeared. He was gone about four
hours, but when he reappeared he, too,
had a new pair of shoes.

“What kep you so long,
asked his friend.

“T had to kill twenty of dem Boches
befo’ I got a pair to fit me,” he an-
swered.

“Did ve bring home that pane of glass

“Qj did not. Oi was after a twilve

| LITERARY SOCIETIES |

LITERARY SOCIETIES.

Although the work of both literary so-
cieties had to be suspended during the
S. A. T. C., the work this year has been
very successful. At the opening of this
Spring term nearly a hundred students
joined the societies and showed much in-
terest in their work.

Eumencan Society.

In this society fifty-two new members
were initiated during a very interesting
and entertaining ceremony. Many left
the hall sheeless and hatless, with a good
excuse for “cutting” church the next
morning. This large class of neophytes
with those who were veteran slingers of
the horned beast made up the largest
society the Eus. have had in many years.

Every one entered heartily into the
work of the society, especially “Bull”
Liston and some of his satellites. “The
first contest of interest was the Fresh-
Soph debate. “There were seventeen en-
tries. Of these seventeen the lucky
three were Mitchell, J. C. McCaskill,
and A. P. Ormond. Ormond having the
gift of gab and more experienced in hol-
lowing for the cows talked away with
the medal.

In the finals for the Inter-Collegiate
Debating ‘Team, Flinn and Woods made
the shades Demosthenes and Cicero look
on green with envy.

For many weeks the halls and woods
of Davidson resounded with the echoes
of Freshmen and Sophomores in distress
wrestling over their declamations, On
February tzth every one was relieved of
these terrible sounds, when Houston
White “copped” the  Fresh-Soph — de-
claimer’s medal for the Eu. Society.

The past year has been one of marked
improvement in the work of the mem-
bers. “They have entered into the con-
tests with more zest and enthusiasm.
The two lower classes are to be con-
gratulated on their interest and from all
indications the’ other literary society on
the hill will have to push up to hold its
place as the winner of trophies and med-
als.

Although the initiation fee and dues! Do you ask him to shout it?

were lowered, the large number of men
taken in enables the Society to make sev-
cral needed improvements. ‘Vhe exterior
wood work has been painted “college
white” and the stairs and — balustrade
have been repaired,

Those who guided the Society through
the Spring term were Flinn, President;
J. G. Richards, Vice President; J. R
Boulware, Secretary, and S. “T. McCloy,
Reviewer, for the session, and Woods.
President ; Sullivan, Vice-President; Me-
Pheeters, Secretary, and A. R. Craig,
Reviewer for the last session. The of-
ficer for the first session next year will
he Askew, President; J. R. Boulware.
Vice-President; G. N. Atkinson, secre-
tary, and W. B. Sullivan, Reviewer.

Philanthropic Society.

The work of the Phi Society for the
past term can be called successful when
all the difficulties and obstacles are con-
sidered. The first term began with R
D. Hall as President. His first meet-
ing was the occasion of initiating some
forty Freshmen and five upper classmen,
who give promise of good work in the
future. Due to the unsatisfactory heat-
ing of the society hall several programs
had to be cut short and were not what
they should have been, During the first
term the Fresh-Soph Declaimer’s medal
~vas awarded to A, D, Currie, ‘21. The
last term, with W, M. Currie as Presi-
dent, was much more successful. Dur-
ing this term the Phis were winners in
both Inter-Society contests. In the
Fresh-Soph debate, McKeithan, Dunlap
and Long were victorious over the Eus.
the medal being awarded to McKeithan.
'22. In the Junior-Senior debate the
Phis, represented by Alexander, Spence,
and Chalmers. were also victorious over
the Eus! ‘The Alumni Debating Cup
was awarded to the Phis as it was the
fourth successive year the Phis had been
victors over the Eus. D, M. Chalmers,
‘20, was awarded the debater’s medal
In the Inter-Collegiate debates. the Phis
were represented ‘by R. D. Hall, ‘19,
E. G. Lilly, ’19, and W, M. Currie,
‘19. Currie and Lilly were victors over
Washington and Let.

Much interest was shown in the Es-
say contest.

cided winner with Alexander and How-
ell receiving honorable mention.

W. F. Hall, D. W. Roberts and D.

chosen were. R. D. Hall, O. P. Hart.
E. G. Lilly and W. M. Currie.

The Junior Society for new men is to
be reinstated next year, thus giving all
regular meetings to ‘the Senior Society.

1 DOUBT IT.
When two rosy lips are upturned to
your own,
With no one to gossip about it,
Do you pray for endurance to leave

them alone?
Maybe you do—but I doubt it.

When a dear little waist is in reach of
your own,
With a wonderful roundness about it,
Do you argue the point twist the right
and the wrong?
Maybe you do—but 1 doubt it.

When a dear little hand you're permit-
ted to seize,
With a velvety softness about it,
Do you think she will never permit it
to squeeze?
Maybe you do—but 1 doubt it.

When a dear little head lies close to your
own,
With its curly ringlets about it,
Do you look at your watch and say you
must go?
Maybe yeu do—but PE doubt it.

And if by these arts, you have captured
a heart,
With endearing sweetness about it,
Will you guard it and keep it and act
the good part?
Maybe you will—but | doubt it.

“TE Doubt Ut."

An Answer to

When a curly headed boy, handsome and
bold,
Whispers ‘sweet nothings as his arms
you enfold.
Tell oth-
ers about it?
Well. maybe you do—but 1 doubt it.

When he tenders you candy and a trip
to the show,
Suggesting an auto ride just his
money to blew,
Do you think of the cost and the worry
about it?

Well, mavhe you do—but [ doubt it.

If mussed was your hair and the waist
that you wore,
lf he'd asked for one kiss and taken
a score,
Did you threaten to tell
about it?
Weill, maybe you do—but T doubt it.

your mama

If a bid to the hops you had taken for
granted,

And he had dragged some one else to
the dance that you wanted,
Would you act just as sweet when he

told you about it?
Well, maybe vou doe—but | doubt it.

If he spent all he made and the future
looked blue,

Would you surrender your pleasures and
stick like glue,

“Live on love” in a cottage with roses
about it?

Well, maybe you do—but I doubt it.

CAPTAIN |. D.. McCONNELL
DIES AT HOME.

The sympathy of the student body
goes out to Drs. J. M. and J. W. Me-
Connell, in the. loss of their father,
Captain J. D. McConnell, who died at
his home in McCennellville, §. C., May
22.

Captain McConnell was eighty-six
years old and a distinguished veteran of
the Civil War, He was one of the
most prominent citizens of York county
and numbered his friends by the hun-
dreds. He was an elder in the Presby-
terian church and a devoted church

D. M. Chalmers was de-| worker all his life.

New Letter Men Undergo Both Comical
and Impressive Ceremony.

A rare show was exhibited on the
streets of Davidson, Saturday. May to.
‘The first act began at 5 p. m. After
its first rehearsal and a slight intermis-
sion for mess, the final performance was
given for the entertainment of the
“train crew” of the 7:11. The actors

balt—R. B. Cunningham (Mer.),
Johnson, Sample, Miller, McArn; Bas-
ketball—J. D. Wate (Mgr.) ; Track—

Upon the first outburst, this wonder-
ful vocal band attracted such a crowd
that even an experienced traffic cop as
Mer. Watt was unable to keep the
streets clear. “Black Buck Private”
“Cop” Johnson, Acting Major, led his
battalion of a single squad through
many interesting maneuvres with his
strictly 1. D. R. command, “Can‘idates

Brass button, “Officer Miller,” Jead-
ing the parade, captured the heart of all!
the nurses in the park. Especially was
this shown by the case of Mrs. Black-
Cloud (colored), who followed him ad-
miringly. After the parade she settled .
down again on her wheelbarrow, nurs-
ing her “Sugar-baby Sample” on her
modern nippled bottle.

“Miss Mikey” Dug McArn, A. D..
hetter known as “Caruso” and “Let us
vote,” removed the crowds with her
soft, melodious bass tones. Miss Willi-
frank Hall reached the other extreme
of attractiveness in her modest appeals
to the passersby for the purchase of a
flower,
