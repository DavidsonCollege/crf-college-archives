Men's Soccer Falls to N. C. State,
Defeats Appalachian State 2-1

By Tom Price

In two home matches this week,
the Davidson men’s soccer team
came away with a split. The Wild-
cats nearly pulled off a come from
behind upset of North Carolina
State, but eventually lost on a
late, heartbreaking goal. Against
Appalachian State on Saturday
night, the ‘Cats did manage a
successful comeback in gaining
a2-1 win. The the two games left
the Wildcat record at 3-7-1.

After 118 minutes of intense,
emotional soccer, Davidson and
N.C. State were deadlocked 2-2.
State scored midway through the
first half and then seemed to break
the game open with a score early
in the second half. Then, sud-
denly it seemed, the ‘Cats scored
twice in the last twenty.minutes
of the second half to send the
game into overtime.

With only a minute and a
half left in the second period of
overtime, N.C. State forward Roy
Lassiter outraced the Wildcat de-
fense to score and give the
Wolfpack a hard-fought 3-2 win.

Ben Hayes netted the first
goal for Davidson off a beautiful
cross from Spider Wormuth.
Hayes was recently moved up
from ‘the defensive end to help
stimulate the offense. Coach
Slagle’s action seems to have
worked and Hayes is emerging as
one of the team’s leading scorers.

Stopper Matt Spear scored the
tying goal after the State goalkeeper
bobbled the ball in front of the net.

Prior tothis season, Scar had never
scored a college goal, but now has
two on the season. His offensive
contributions are representative of
the team’s effort to find new scor-
ers.

* Davidson’s win over Liberty,
because of Big South scheduling
oddities, counted only for Lib-
erty.

Slagle remains pleased with
his team’s efforts. He explained
that the goal by Lassiter was partly
a result of Davidson’s aggressive
play. “We were playing for the win
on acorner kick play and it took a
great individual effort to beat us,”
he said. Davidson had pushed its

defensive players up in front of the

goal to try and score. When State

got the ball back, Lassiter simply

outran the Davidson defense.

Slagle said he considers Lassiter to

be “among the three fastest players
in the NCAA.”

Despite periods of sloppy
play, the team managed to pull
out a 2-1 victory over Appala-
chian State Saturday night in their
first game of Charlie’s Tourna-
ment. The Mountaineers scored
first when Davidson fullback
Cliff Castelloe and goalkeeper
Doug Long miscommunicated in
aneffortto get the ball into Long’s
hands.

The Davidson offense grew
more effective and the ‘Cats

| ‘began bombarding the Mountain-

" eer goalkeeper with shots. After
a couple of impressive saves by
the goalkeeper and twoshots that
hitthe crossbar, unior Craig Omli
finally put the ball into the net to
tie the game. Only minutes later,
senior Spider Wormuth scored
the game-winning goal on a
header.

The five goals scored in these
two games are an indication that
the Wildcats are improving of-
fensively. The loss of All-Ameri-

can Rob Ukrop has caused the “Cats

to find other scorers. Players such
as Wormuth, Spear, Omli and

Hayes are helping to fill the void.

Slagle said that at this junc-

ture, “Our goal is to get back to

.500 and then we will be back in

the regional rankings.”

Swimmers & Divers Nipped
By UNCC in Debut Performance

By Chris Hood

Davidson’s varsity swimming
and diving squads returned to ac-
tion for the first time since 1982
with a home meet against UNCC
on October 8. Although the men
lost 110-101 and the women fell
126-91, there was much cause for
optimism among the ‘Cats.

“I was amazed at how competi-
tive we were,” beamed Head Coach
Ron Morrow. “We’ve attracted
some caliber swimmers and divers
and we’re going to do well.”

Hayler Osborn and Dan Ream
captured the 100 meter
Breaststroke and 500 meter events

with times of 1:05.92 and 5:27.69,
respectively.

For the women, Miche Baskett’s
27.94 in the 50 meter Freestyle
earned her a first-place finish.
Tracy Barwick won the 100 meter

Butterfly, but her time was un- -

available.

The ‘Cats swept the top spots in
all four diving events. Thad Reece
scored 179.20 points to win the
one meter competition, but his
winning score in the three meter
event was notcalculated. Liz Vona
tallied 203.75 points in the one
meter; her three meter results were
also unavailable.

Morrow pointed to Davidson’s
depth as its strongest suit. “We
have somany swimmers willing to
put out the effort,” he explained.

With the new timing system at
Cannon Pool, swimming and div-
ing meets are more geared toward
the spectators. “Before, it was so
hard to know what was going on,”
Morrow said.

The ‘Cats will host two meets :

over Homecoming weekend: On

October 25, Georgia Tech visits }

Women's Harriers Take Second
At the Citadel Invitational Meet

By Richard Wharton

The Davidson cross country
team spent fall break recuperating
and undergoing relaxation therapy
at the Isle of Palms in Charleston,
South Carolina. After recovering
sufficiently from the stressful pre-
fall break atmosphere at Davidson,
the men’sand women’s teams went
on toexcellent individual perform-

ances at the Citadel Invitational on
Saturday, October 5.

The day dawned overcast and
hot, with high humidity - definitely
not ideal conditions for racing.
However, the women’s team
showed their mettle as they once
again ran very well and came up
with a second-place finish, only a
few points behind Southern Con-

ference powerhouse Furman. Fin- .
ishing first for the Wildcats was |

team captain Kathy Beach, with

sophomore Karen Marshall right |
behind her. Astounding freshman }-
Elizabeth Bishop rounded out |
Davidson’s top three, with another

demonstration of the women’s

Freshman cornerback Andre
Ferree’s interception in the final
minute of the game made sure
Davidson’s 16-14 victory over
Washington and Lee Saturday in
Lexington, Va. The Wildcats (2-3)
had assumed a 16-0 advantage in
the third quarter, but watched it
evaporate with a pair of fourth
quarter W&L touchdown drives.
The Generals had the ball after a
recovered onside kick before Fer-
ree’s interception snuffed their
hopes.

Junior Leonel Benoist’s
fumble recovery gave the Wild-
cats fine field position on their first
offensive possession. That drive
started at the W&L 35-yard line,
and ended two plays later in the
endzoneona 32-yard scoring strike
from Richard Howell to John
Bodkin. Drew Fassett missed the
extra point, but redeemed himself
in the second quarter with a 27-
yard field goal that made the score
9-0 at the half.

In the third quarter, freshman
Kevin Holzworth replaced the in-
jured Howell and completed the
scoring for Davidson with a 26-
yard touchdown throw to Kelly
Shirley. Fassett’s PAT made the

Football Hangs On
To Beat W&L 16-14

score 16-0.

On the possession that fol-
lowed, the Generals drove to the
Davidson 35, but were bogged
down by two holding penalties, an
offsides penalty and three consccu-
tive quarterback sacks. However,
on the subsequent 4th-and-54,
Davidson roughed the punter for
anautomatic first down. Washing-
ton and Lee made the most of the
reprieve, cashing in that drive fora
touchdown, and scoring another.
TD to close to within 16-14 before
Ferree’s interception finalized the
outcome.

Howell completed 8-12 passes
for 110 yards and no interceptions
and Holzworth 2-4 passes for 39
yards and no interceptions to lead
a surprisingly effective Wildcat
passing attack. John Bodkin caught
five balls for 79 yards. The
Davidson defense held the Gener-
als to just 19 yards on 37 rushes.

The Wildcats go on the toad
for the final time next Saturday
with a game at Methodist. The
Monarchs fell to 1-4 Saturday with
a 34-0 loss to Bridgewater.
Davidson leads the series 2-0, and
defeated the Methodist 49-7 a year
ago.
