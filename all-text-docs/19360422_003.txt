Mr. Burt is one of the United

test. Mr. Burt is active in other
fields oP literature as well however.

cial turn. The fraternity has been
looking forward for quite a.while
tov the coming of Struthers Burt.

Wrong Picture Shown
By Shipping Error

Due to improper labeling, the
moving pictures originally intended
to be shown here last Friday night
at 7 o'clock went elsewhere and an-
other set was shown here.

Only two reels were shown, one
of which was “How All-Woo! Blan-
kets Are Made.” showing the -se-
lecting, assorting, dycing and weav-
ing of the blankets. The other
was entitled “Great Ceasar’s Ghost”
which was an aniftiated cartoon de-
picting scenes in Italy. Both were
sound reels,

The reels originally scheduled
were: "Industrious Diamonds,” one
reel silent. “Take It Easy.” one reel
souyd, and “The Test Supreme,”
two reels sound. The departments
of Chemistry and Physics expect to
be able to present these reels in

May if they are not already selnetl=

ROTC JUNIORS
ATTEND CAMP
THIS SUMMER

Colonel Rhett Appoints Group
Leaders in Various Camp
Activities

Plans are gradually taking shape
for the junior R. O. T. C. students’
summer camp to be held at Fort
McClellan, near Anniston, Ala.
which will open on Sunday, June
7, and will. be in operation until
Saturday, July 8.

The six weeks of camp is a part
of the regular course for advanced
R. O..T. C. students and therefore
must -be attended by all juniors in
the department,

Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph C. Hol-
liday, an instructor at The .Citadel,
has been appointed camp comman-
der, and Major Charles W. Scifert
and Sergeant B. R. Burton, mem-
bers of the faculty in this depart-
ment here, have tentative orders for
duty at the camp.

. Last week, in answer to a request
from Colonel Holliday, Colonel
Rhett_appointed the group. leaders
as follows: Wilbur Edwards, rep-
resentative for the group in civilian
matters; Joe ITunter, captain of the
militacy field meet; Ed Mack, cap-
tain of the rifle team; Maurice Pea-
body, captain of the swimming
team: Jim Morton, captain of the
boxing team; Jack Somerville, cap-
tain of the baseball team; and Jim
Morton, John Winn, Hal Overton,
Harry Kuykendall and Daymond
Turner, to be connected with the
camp newspaper.

During the past few.weeks, Dr.
McConnell has,been busy inoculat-
ing these students for typhoid and
vaccinating them, for smallpox, in
preparation for the period in camp.

Fort McClellan is the post of a
battalion of the Twenty-second In-
fantry and is used each summer for
the R, O. T. C. camp, a C. M. T. C.
camp, and the field maneuvers of

the National Guard. r

TWO oPEEGHES
TO SGIENTIOTs

F. M. Toole and W. B. Wart-
man Make Lectures to
Gamma Sigma Epsilon

Two technical speeches were
heard by Gamma Sigma Epsi-
lon at its last meeting, Mon-
day, April 13.

FM. Toote lectured on the
preparation and properties of

Jliquid air and W. 2B. Wartman
told of “Progress in Seience in
1935.”

During the last of this week, in-
itiation of new members will take
plice and next) Monday night at
the regular meeting, an election of
next year's olficers will be ‘held.

An open meeting is plied for
about the frst of May foe (he chem-
istry department men who, by vir-
tuc of interzst in chemistry and
ood grades in that subject: are
prospects fore Ganiina Sigma Ep-
silon. The exact date will depend
on the convenience of the guest
speaker who will be an authority

on some phase of chemistry. Bids-{-

are to be sent. ,

Toole’s Bpeech: at the last gath-
ering of the fraternity was somg-
what hampered by the fact that the
prohibitive price of liquid air made
it impossible for him to give dem-
austrations of the properties af this
uid which exists only at -146 de-
grees centigrade. However, by
means of diagrams, he illustrated
how it makes rubber like glass in
brittleness and does other seemingly
impossible things.

The extremes of pressure and
temperature required to liqnify- air.
he explained in detail along with
the uses of the comparatively new
refrigerant in) industry.

Among the advances made in sci-
ence in 1935 which Wartman listed
in his speech were:

A new-method of overcaming sur-
face tension in dying textiles so that
the dye may penetrate into the cloth
bett@yrand form fast colors.

tn mediciné-he mentioned a new
autitoxin for use against
which prevents serum sickness, a
mild (hut dreaded)_form of the-dis-
vase itseli.

The preatest advance in photog-
raphy is color movies which now
can be taken in an ordinary mov-
ing picture camera and projected
with standard equipment without
the use of special Hiters and prisms.
The film has a iultiple layer of
emulsions which acts as fillers
would and produces a film in full
color which looks natural.

In criminology a method of show-
ing finger prints on other than slick
surfaces has heen perfected. Ar sil-
ver salt is poured on the spot and
the chloride tin human perspiration
which is deposited by the finger per-
cipitates the silver waking the print
visible.

There were other wainoy advances
that he listeds including the isola-
tion of several of the vitamins, and
agricultural discoveries,

Dr. Gwynn Lectures To
Winthrop Student Body

Addresses Delivered Saturday
’ Afternoon, Night and Sun-
day Morning

RELIGION IS SUBJECT |

Protestantism and Christianity
Are Discussed

Dr. P. 1I..CGwynn delivered
a series of addresses to the stu-
dent bady ‘of Winthrop College
over the week-end. His ‘first
address was’ on Saturday aiter-
noon, and his second on Satur-
day night. Sunday morning he
spoke: to the leaders ofthe Y.
WoC. AL at Wanthrop.

In his address. on “The, History

and Meaning of Protestantism,” Dr.
Gwinn traced the genesis of Pro-
testantism from the Protestant Re-
formation of the twelfth century,
which resulted in a complete and
tinal division of Christian forces.
This revo took the form of pro-
test against certain
in the Church of Rome, and its cen-
tral issue was the seat of author-
ity in religion. The reformed reli-
vion became a Biblical religion, and
the Bible, hitherto reserved — for
scholars and theologians. was trans-
lated inte the vernacular and made
available to the common people. Dr.
Gwynn. then discussed the major
points on which Catholies and Pro-
testants diver, showing that the
Catholic ideal is the suppression of
persunaliyy, while the Protestant
ideal ig Che realization of person-
ality. The two groups differ in re-
gard to the ideal of the Christian
life, the nature and. authority of the
Christian ministry, the relation of
the church ta other social institu.
tions, and the relation of the differ-
ent brauches af the church to one
another.” Protestantism has resulted
in the expressian of the <emocratic
spirit in religion, in individualism
and democracy. Also, the Bible be-
coming the center of authority has
forced the Protestant church to. be-
come a religidn of education and
enlightenment, Protestantism has
been the great bulwark of civil and
religious tiberty. In regard to the
future of Protestantism, it is true
that Protestanliom lacks a core of
central authorily, whith tends to
dhasipate its powur as a force in so-
cial affairs. but we need to remem-
ber that the on'ly unity worth hav-
ing is that which’ is won through
freedom, The desired ‘end-is to
move in the direction of co-opera-
tion withont sacrifice of vital con-
viclions.
In his address on “The Essentials
Chrisuan Living.” De. Gwyan
stated that “Christianity is the re-
‘igion of a person, which makes it
a vital gross experience.” The
