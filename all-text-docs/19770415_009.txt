Lack of communication hurts

Students disclose trouble

By DENNIS McLAWHORN

Although work-study pro-
vides many students with
financial aid, some students
have had problems with the
program.

One student who was work-
ing in the library as a fresh-
man finished her job before her
time was up. She assumed
that since she had finished her
work, she could leave early.

Eventually she began re-
ceiving letters informing her
that she had to make up the
time she had not worked even
though she had accomplished
the amount of work desig-
nated for that time.

The girl remarked, ‘‘I didn’t
realize I had to make up the
time. They probably told me,
but I forgot.

“I think the college should

ity of the South

D. Chittney, the

Director of Financial Aid and
Career Services at the Univer-
sity of the South (Sewanee),
described a somewhat differ-
ent approach to work-study as
a part of scholarship pack-
ages.

““‘We have a real active
program. Roughly 30 percent
of our student body is engaged
in work-study tasks. We re-
quire most scholarship stu-
dents to accept aid in the form
of work. The more a student is
willing to work the less he or
she has to take out in loans,”’
she said.

“The average student works
six to eight hours a week at
$2.30 an hour. We have stu-
dents performing a wide as-
sortment of tasks, ranging
from summer non-profit jobs
to translating work for foreign
language professors to hospi-
tal work. We have lots of
money available for this and
our system works fine,’’ she
concluded.

Williams College

Williams College, in Wil-
liamsburg, Massachusetts,
pays according to a sliding
scale, starting with the. min-
imum wage. Their students
are routinely offered work-
study jobs as part of scholar-
ships, and the student can
accept the job or take out a
larger loan instead.

Swarthmore College

Swarthmore College, in
Pennsylvania, employs from
one-quarter to one-third of) its
1225 students in jobs. The pay
scale runs from $2.00 to $2.60.
Elizabeth Dow, the Director of
Financial Aid there, said that
the pay depends on the stu-
dent’s skills and the number of
semesters spent at that job.

“Not everybody on a schol-

arship has a federally-funded
work-study job. Some find

out it.”’

Another work-study stu-
dent had some comments.
“There’s so many conflicting
things about work-study.
You're appreciative of it, be-
cause you realize you need it.

“And yet at the same time
you feel you’re in the dark,
because every aspect isn’t
made clear to you at the
start.”’

Because of a communication
gap, this student fell months
behind in her hours she was
supposed to work. Around
Christmas, there was a death
in her family which temporar-
ily relieved her financial situ-
ation.

“This year, I don’t need to
work, but I need to put in the
hours so I'll be reconsidered
for financial aid next yeat,”’
she said.

Another student working in
an administrative office com-
plained of a lack of time for
extracurricular activities.

Her job is like many other
work-study positions in that
“there’s no conceivable way
you can study.”

Her suggestion as a solution
to this problem, however, does
not deal at all with work-
study. She suggested giving
course credit for labs to allow

Other students have had
trouble getting a work-study
job for various reasons.

One student’s father recent -
ly lost his job, leaving him in
a financial jam. In order to
receive financial aid, he was
required to fill out a Parents’
Confidential Statement (PCS).
The form is a report of the
previous year’s income, how-
ever, and the student’s father
had a steady job in that
previous year.

He remarked, ‘‘She (Brenda
Parnell, Assistant Director of
Admissions and Financial
Aid) referred me to Ron Scott
or Chip Stone, but both were
filled up.

“So I got a hold of Rob
Mitchell and started deliver-
ing The Davidsonians.”’

One freshman’s parents got
a divorce, forcing her into
financial troubles. The college
has not approved her for
financial aid, because she has
some stocks. However, she is
not allowed to touch the
stocks for another.two years.

Consequently, she has been
forced to apply for a govern-
ment loan,

Commenting on the difficul-
ty to receive financial aid in
general, one student re-
marked, ‘‘You have to be a

she said.

Dow then explained that
Swarthmore was caught in the
fiscal pinch felt by similar
institutes across the country.

-She then said that they would

continue to fill the needs of all
their students needing finan-
cial aid.

William and Mary

The College of William and
Mary also pays the minimum
wage. Mr. E. Leo Looney, the
Director of Student Aid, ela-
borated on their program, ‘‘A
few students doing skilled
tasks, like working with the
computers, or on individual
jebs such as being a security
guard, make slightly higher.

“Some don’t have financial
assistance but have jobs direc-
tly funded by the school.
Actually, NDSL pays only a
small amount of a total fund-
ing for that: out of 800 or so
with work-study jobs, only
150 are federally funded,’’
Looney said. William and
Mary has 4200 undergraduate
students.

“Every student granted fin-
ancial aid is given a job offer
and its up to the student to
accept it or not. Work-study
jobs are then filled by those
having the highest need be-
cause they can't afford to take
out any more loans,”’ he said.

The State of Virginia makes
a sizable amount of money
available to schools there to
use for supporting work-study
jobs, according to Looney.

He concluded by saying
that academi€¢ offices and their
library are the two biggest
employers. A handful of grad-
uate students are given jobs
similar in nature to -graduate

Opinion
Complaints correct no
work-study problems

By CATHERINE LANDIS
Editor

Work-study is one of the most
popular issues about which 20 percent
of the student body likes to complain.
But that’s all they do...complain.

They complain about losing finan-
ces during the years due to unexpec-
ted problems at.home. They complain
about not making enough money at
their work-study job. They complain
about having to work twice as hard
spring term to make up for not
making enough money fall and wintér
terms.

The complaints are valid. But they
can do more than complain; they can
actively find solutions to their gripes.

Provisions in the work study
program enable students who lose
finances during the year through
emergency funds. Students who find
they are not making enough money at
one job can go to the work-study
office and get another job.

If students cannot make $800 a
vear, thev need not worry: they must

make $600 minimum during the year
which includes any money earned
during vacation. If they cannot make
the $600, their scholarship money
(that part of the loan which they do
not have to pay back) will be taken
away; they are not kicked out of
Davidson.

Fach check contains a statement on
how much the student has earned. He
can figure out how much he still must
earn to prevent the “‘spring term
crunch” of having to work twice as
hard,

The point, like so many of the
problems Davidson students have, is
communication...or lack of it. Mrs.
Parnell is in her office. Her job is.to
solve any problems a student might
have over work-study.

Davidson, you just don’t assert
yourself. If you have a problem, don’t
just complain about it to your friends.
go to Parnell and yell. If you do not
get results, then you have something
to complain about. But unless you at
least try, you have nothing: to say
