Winthrop College and’ to Mitchell Col-
lege, as well as a regular business meet-
ing.

Audley Gammon and Paul McClana-
han journeyed to Rock Hill, South Car-
olina and spoke to the Student Volun-
teer Group at Winthrop College. Mc-
Clanahan showed the Egyptian as a nor-
mal human being and the spiritual need
for the Egyptian. Gammon presented
Brazil as the land of opportunity, bring-
ing out the opportunities for the gaining
of wealth, the appreciation of beauty, and
for helping the people to develop their
spiritual nature.

Bob Coit and Don Brandon visited the
Student Volunteer Group of Mitchell
College at Statesville, the last of a series
of four deputations, They reviewed
briefly the book “Presbyterian Missions
in the Southern United States,” by E.
T. Thompson and developed the subject
“What A Mitchell College Girl Can Do
To Enhance the Cause of Christ.”

Next Sunday, December 2, Dr. Gwynn
will continue his series of discussions on
world social problems at 4:30 P. M. This
discussion, the third of ‘the series, will
concern “Increased Materialism in the
World as Opposed to Spiritual Values.”
Anyone who is*interested in world prob-
lems is invited to come to the “Y” social
center and enter the discussions.

The Student Volunteer Group is also
planning a missionary play entitled “Ba
Thane,” which is to be given with the
help of the Volunteer Group of Queens-
Chicora College. Saturday night four
members of the local society went to
Charlotte for the first complete rehear-
sal. The business meeting held tast
Sunday was largely devoted to the play
and criticisms of the rehearsal.

STUDENT HS
ORIGINAL IDEA

Designs Christmas Greeting Card
To Be Sent To President
Roosevelt

During the regular chapel program
this morning Stewart Barnes, of the
Sophomore class, presented to the Stu-
dent Body an idea that he had caught
from President Roosevelt's speech at
Harrodsburg, Ky. The President, who
had been viewing the Tennessee Valley
Project, had in his speech, compared the
spirit of the people of today with that

of the pioneers of’ the early days of this ;

great nation. The student told how it
had made him stop and think about the
wonderful opportunities that he had to-
day. He showed how the NRA was re-
sponsible for the FERA and how: the
funds from the FERA had helped so
many students of the nation to continue
their education. It is easy to see how
an education helps mold the characters
of a person and that we the students are
to be the citizens of tomorrow. It was
brought out how easily it is to accept
a gift and just let the appreciation he
taken for granted.

On catching the spirit of the address
he designed a card to show clearly that
we the students are firmly backing the
administration in this field and wish to
express our gratitude to the President
while he is still in office and not wait
until later on to thank him and com-
mend him on the courage it took to in-
vest such a large amount of the coun-
try's wealth in such an experiment.

The card, which is showing at the
Student’s Store, shows plainly the spirit
of the thoughts given above. On one
Side the letters NRA are stamped. In
the middle of the card there is an old
fashioned stage coach carrying some
men and women. Over the top of the
coach are the words, “The Pioneers of
1934.” By the side of the road on which
the coach is traveling is a signboard
bearing the inscription “To Peace and
Prosperity.”

The originator of the idea expresses
‘the hope that the students of Davidson
will catch the spirit of the movement
and. will send one to the President at
Christmas.

Just now the men of Foster Memorial

potatoes. This shows that people are
vitally interested in doing what they
can.” And speaking of the type of peo-
ple in this section he also says, “The peo-

forbears. Many of them have been de-

Davidsonian Photo
Contest Has Begun

Pictures Are Being Taken Of
Life On Davidson Campus

Picture-taking is getting toybe quite a
habit on the campus of Davidson College.
Everywhere one goes he sees Freshmen,
Sophomores, and even Juniors and Sen-
iors taking pictures of the many differ-
ent and varied activities that are each
day preserving the history of David-
son.

What is all this picture-taking about?
These photographs are being taken by
contestants who are in the contest being
sponsored by Mr. W. I. Van Ness, Char-
lotte dealer in photographic supplies, and
The Davidsonian, All pittures dre to
be made between now and December 12,
of any phase of life on the Davidson
campus, including athletics, student life,
fraternity life, etc.

Any students wishing to enter this con-
test may do so, but all pictures must be
turned in at The Davidsonian office by
six o'¢lock P. M,, on the closing day of
the contest.

The first prize of five dollars worth

Watts-Georgia Situation
a Is Tense
(Continued from Page 1)

This will be the third engagement of
the two teams and Watts will go on the
field conscious of having their tifle, the
only permanently undefeated team in the
Nation, at stake, defeating Georgia 7-0
in 1932 and 6-0 in 1933, Bethea, Small-
ridge, Sprunt and Wallace, of last year’s
Watts Varsity, are again eligible’ this
year while Byerly, stellar end, is the
only Georgia Varsity player remaining.

‘Watts evidently has the advantage in
weight, particularly in the fine, but
Georgia is doped to have the speedier
team, particularly as regards the back-
field. Dickson and Partridge are out-
standing in Georgia’s backfield. The
Watts line will undoubtedly be aided by
members of the Freshman Class, Og-
burn, Sparks and Shephard. Georgia, how-
ever, possesses only four freshmen and
they are all on the Yearling football
team and therefore ineligible.

Forecasting statistics, however, may be
thrown to the winds when Georgia meets
Watts. The Watts coaches are hard at
work training the Watts “Terriers” in
the accepted methods of exterminating
“Rats” and, on the other hand, the
Georgia coaches are busy oiling and
regulating the Georgia dynamo so as to
increase its production of Kilowatts.

Statements from the managers, coaches,
cheerleaders, and the janitors follow:

Manager Atwater Speaks

“Watts expects nothing less than a
decisive victory. Watts labels as clowns,
shines and buffoons any and all who have
the audacity to suggest that Georgia has
any possible chance whatsoever of a vic~
tory over the only undefeated team in
the Nation, Watts dormitory.

President Brown Explains

Upon being approached for a state-
ment of his faith in the merits of the
Georgia team, Brown refused to make a
statement. He regretted keenly that his
political position would not allow taking
sides in issues vitally concerning the in-
terests of his constituents.

Because of these inhibitions, Brown
stated that he could not take a strong
position in favor of Georgia, inasmuch as
this stand would entail a betrayal of his

‘erstwhile bosom friends who in their

greatest hour of sorrow need sympathy,
condolence and encouragement rather
than the scorn of one who by a combina-
tion of circumstances has been removed
from their woe-charged ranks.

Coaches Siewers and Ravenel

Line Coach J. D, Siewers: “With a
sturdy line such as we have in front of
our flashy backs, there is no reason why
we shouldn’t down the Watts team, whose
first team is no good and who has no re-
serve material at all. Our team is out
for revenge over the tea hounds as shown
by the interest aroused in the superior
type of pep meetings being held in front
of our Alma Mater.”

Backfield Coach Ravenel: “Weare ex-
pecting our boys to go out there and beat
the Beau Brummels from ‘Watts by a
rather large score. All our boys will see
action in the game, as we have so much
reserve strength that there is not much
choice as to who should play on the start-

ing team. In “Dixie” Partridge, we have
the smartest quarterback since Benny
Friedman.”

Say Wingfield and Cathey

Wingfield and Cathey regret that the
gym, having only a backfield—Wingfield,
Doc Unger, and Doc Charlie—cannot
enter the game but are forced to divert
their gridiron proclivities to Watts.
“Boody” says: “As for comparing the
two teams, my sense of logic is hurt as
there can be no comparison to the super-
ior team of Watts. I will put out such
backs that Watts will need no fine ex-
xept for a center.”

“Flip” Cathey: “The game between
Watts and Georgia will make Sherman’s
march through Georgia look like a picnic,
I hate to see my pal and roommate,
“Boody”, work so hard to produce a good
line backfield when all my line will need
is a punter,”

And The Janitors—

John, Georgia: “Yessuh, Gawgia’s
goin’ to beat Watts.”

Crawford, Watts: “Watts will sho
ovuhcome Gawgia, that’s my sentiments.”
Hujohn could not be found but we
strongly suspect that “thems his senti-
ments too.” Enoch, veteran prognosti-
cator among the colored race refuses to
committ himself.
