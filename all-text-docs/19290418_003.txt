CLEMSON TRACKMEN HERE SATURDAY |

THE LATEST.

From Diamond and Cinder
Path

P. R. ALDERMAN

That wa sa great game of baseball
anyhow, with Wofford, although the
‘Cats did come out on the little end of
a 3-2 count. Johnnie McInnis pitched
a faultless game for Davidson, but
Hall, young Soph twirler for Wofford,
also pitched very good ball, had just
a little more airtight support from his
mates. Our infield, however, showed
quite a lot of improvement since the
first of the season.

Looks like the Netmen are in
for a mighty successful season ac-
cording to the matches they played
last week. Erskine and Furman
bowed to the varsity in succession
last week, 6-0 and 4-2 respectively,
while the Fresh were handing the
Charlotte Hi racqeteers a 5-1 de-
feat. We're expecting big things
from Capt. John Roddey and his
men this Spring!

The Kitten nine didn’t seem to have
much trouble with Statesville Hi last
Friday. That’s a snappy infield de-
veloping, with “Shad” Goodson on
third and Bernhardt on short making
it hard for anybody to connect up for
a grounder in that direction and reach
first safely. As the score of this game
indicates, there are also some heavy
hitters on the Fresh squad.

Capt. Tom Hill showed ’em “how
it ought to be done” when it comes
to the mat, didn’t he? That was a
big match up at Richmond, with
wrestlers from all over the country
participating, and it was no small
honor or easy task to win a na-
tional title against ’em but Tom
did it and is now champion of the
United States in the 165 pound
class!

Last Saturday ended the Tech Re-
lays as well as many old records, for
the present. The Wildcats, with Cur-
rie and Whittle their best hopes failed
to take a first place but did pull down
two seconds—Currie in the 100 and
Whittle in the 220 low hurdles. Tak-
ing into consideration that the 220
record was shattered, with Whittle
pushing the winner, makes a second
place in that event plenty good, espe-
cially as the time for that was only
23.2 seconds.

“Whiz” Miller’s Batting eye
surely was OK in the W. & L.
game. The 'Cats’ left-fielder con-
nected with the offerings of the
General’s twirlers for a home run
and a double out of, four times up.
Capt. Ratchford is also hitting the
old pill, collecting two hits in the
W. & L. and one in the V: M. I.
game. The ’Cat nine defeated the
former but lost to the latter, both
games being featured mainly by
errors on each team.

Had the Tech relays come about two
week later than they did Capt. John
Currie would very probably have been
winner of the 100 yard dash. Due to re-
cent illness Davidson’s star dashman
is not in the best of form at present,
but came out second in the 100 in the
ech relays nevertheless. Currie was
judged winner of this dash by two
judges but three favored Gordon of
Indiana. f

The golf team made a good start
in the state intercollegiate matches,
defeating Duke, but lost in a hard-
fought match to the Carolina team
the next day. In the final match
at Greensboro, however, Jack Pep-
per and Julian Hutaff got off some
pretty shots, the former being run-
ner-up for low score and the latter
winning the driving honors with
759 yards for three balls. That's
socking the little white ball all
right!

Fellows, the Clemson Tigers will be
here this week-end with their track
squad and if it’s as good as their
football team was last Fall, it’s going
to be a struggle worth seeing. This
will very probably be the case so let's
be out there and help the ’Cats pay
back that gridiron defeat.

King Baseball reigns undisputed
now, with the old willow cracking
against the apple from sandlot to
Polo Grounds. As usual, practically
every team in every league is slated
as sure winner of the pennant, but
this number will rapidly decrease
with the first few games. There is
a rumor that the “Sultan of the

Catawba Defeated
By Davidson Fresh

Aycock of Visitors High Point
Man With 15 Points

The Davidson College Freshman de-
feated Catawba College in a very exciting
track meet held on Richardson Field,
Tuesday, April 9, by a score of 73 to 44.
Competition was close in all events ex-
cept the discus, the broad jump, the ‘shot
put and the javelin. These four events
turned the tide in favor of the “Wild-
kittens” as Catawba was able to clinch
only two third places for a total of two
out of twenty-seven points in them.

High point man for the meet was Ay-
cock, of Catawba, who took three first
fplaces for a total of fifteen points. He
was closely followed by Lillard, of David-
son, with thirteen points. Following are
the results of the various events:

100 yard dash—Aycock (C), Gorham
(D), McGehee (D), Time, 11 sec.

Currie and Whittle Win

Honors in Two Contests
At Georgia Tech Relays

Davidson Stars Place in Dash and
Hurdles

MANY RECORDS BROKEN

Relay Team Fails to Place in Dis-
tance Medley as Indiana Wins

On last Saturday, Davidson was rep-
resented in the annual Tech Relays by a
relay team composed of Brohard, Kell,
Currie, and Lafferty, and by Currie and
Whittle running the hundred yard dash
and the 220 high hurdles respectively. In
the nineteen events making up the final
day of the relays, 12 new champions were
crowned which indicates the quality and
the number of the men who participated
in the various contests.

Davidson's only places were gained by
John Currie in the hundred yard dash
and by Heath Whittle in the 220 low
hurdles, each winning a close second in
the final, heat.

Gordon, of Indiana, high
honors in the century, barely nosing out
John Currie in ten flat, which time has
been bettered by the latter by four-tenths
of a second,

In the 220 hurdles, Whittle, with a
final effort came in only about a foot
behind Beard of Auburn. The latter
established a new record of 24.2 seconds
for this event. Whittle’s best time prior
to this was 26.2 and so he set a new
record for Davidson,

The relay team, as the rest ef the
southern relays teams, failed to place in
the distance medley, Indiana and Michi-
gan Normal carrying off all honors in
this part of the field. The 'Cat team came
out fourth in the event, however.

Although the winners of the relays are
not determined by team scores but are
picked as individuals, Indiana was easily
winner over the other competitors in
points registered. Auburn led in tie num-
ber of records crashed, breaking three
of the dozen. ~

Bows to ’Cat Nine

V. M. I. Wins From Davidson in
First Game of Trip

The Davidson baseball squad broke
even on the first two games of their
Virginia trip, losing to V. M. I. on Fri-
day, and defeating W. and L. on ast
Saturday. Davidson took the Generals
into camp with a count of 10-4, but lost
to the Cadets 7-3.

“Buck” held the W. and L..
team well in check during the second
game while the rest of the team sup-
ported him admirably both in the field
and at the plate. The Generals also
help him to the best of their ability by
donating five runs due to errors.

Marrow

Each
team made nine hits, but Davidson got a
total of sixteen bases off of hers while
the Generals managed to hit for an extra
base only once. W. and L. made nine
errors against four for the Carolinians.
Miller got two hits, one a’ double and
another a home run, to take the hitting
honors of the day. Littlejohn got a triple
and Ratchford hit a double for extra base
hits by the Davidson men. Marrow raised
his total number of victims by striking
seven of his opponents out and assisting
in one double play.

Twelve errors slowed up the V. M. I.
game. Davidson started the scoring in
the first frame when two singles, a base
on balls and an error scored two runs.
Another -was scored in the eighth. V.
M. I. scored in the second, third, and
eighth innings. Marks got the only triple
of the game.
