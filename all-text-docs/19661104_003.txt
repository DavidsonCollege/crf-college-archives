DISCUSSES CURRICULUM

Johnston Advocates Revision

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Feature Editor

Although the college curricu-
lum is complete enough to offer
the student both a challenge and
good education, it is time for
Davidson to revise its curricu-
lum, Dean of Faculty Frontis
Johnston said in chapel Tues-
day.

Johnston explained that the
curriculum has not been revised

‘lin several years, and ‘“‘what was

blocks with their hands and feet.

After the assembly, Griffith,
who is from Charlotte. met with
several students who were in-
terested in forming a club here
on campus.

Rhee, who narrated the exhi-
bition, has a sixth degree black
belt and has been teaching ka-
rate for 20 years. His headquar-
ters are in Washington, D. C..
but he has 25 schools in this
country and 12 more in West
Germany. ‘Very successful for

a crafty Oriental,"’ he comment-
ed.
The specific type of karate
which Rhee teaches and which
the three men demonstrated is
Tae Kwon Do, or ‘foot and

hand” karate.

This style originated 1300 years
ago in North Korea under the
New Lightning Dynasty of that
country. Rhee’s organization is
named the Tae Kwon Do Insti-
tute.

Burleson and Griffith wore
karate outfits while demonstrat-

‘ing several individual exercises

and a ‘‘fighting form" called
Advanced Form Number Five.

Then Rhee, in street clothes,
went through a much more ad-
vanced form called Iron Horse.

Rhee explained that- he per-
formed in street clothes be-
cause ‘‘in a fight, you don't have
time to change.’ He also men.

_ tioned that ‘the purpose of mov-

good once is not necessarily

good now.”

Because of this, the faculty is
now in the process of complete-
ly revising the curriculum. ‘‘One
of the recommendations,”” John-
ston remarked, ‘‘of the visiting
self-study committee was that
there is a definite need for re-
vitalization.””

The rapid expansion of public

fist and arm, not the shoulder,
in order to maintain balance.”

To show the importance of
“power. with control,” Rhee de-
livered a powerful sideward
kick which stopped within a
fraction of an inch of Griffith's
chin. Several times during the
program, the students applaud-
ed the quickness, force, and en-
thusiasm which were displayed.

Near the end of the program,
Burleson broke two boards with
a sideward kick and then chop-
ped a cinder block in half with
the knuckles of his clenched fist.

By hurdling two kneeling stu-
dents, he managed to kick a
board held several feet in the
air. He did not break the board,
though, until the third try.

Rhee jumped up and used his

semblance of decline in church-
related liberal arts college, he
continued. This type of school
‘‘now appears obsolete.’

However, Johnston empha-
sized, it is not obsolete. ‘‘It is
relevant to the new cuflture’'
and ‘‘will not. endure a lazy
mind satisfied merely with
facts."

There is still a place for the
serious in the liberal arts col-

lege, the student with a ‘need
to find himself and then lose
himself in causes and ideas.”
But for this student, Johnston
said that the college must be
prepared in the light of the ad-
vance of new knowledge, the
rapid growth of population in
higher education, and ‘‘cataclys-
mic and violent social change.”
Is there too much regimenta-
tion in the present system here

Applications Decrease
Under Early Decision

There has been a noticeable
decrease in Early Decision Plan
applications for admission to
Davidson next year, according
to Director of Admissions H.
Edmunds White.

While 116 applications were

‘made last year on the Early De.
cision Plan, only 80 have been|;

received this year.

“The admissions committee is
just about ready to begin evalua-
tion,” White said.. ‘Those ac-
cepted will be notified by Nov.
30.""

at Davidson? This is the opinion
of some, and to a degree, John-
‘ston agrees. ‘Close order drill
kills thought and never stimu-
lates the imagination.”

He continued, ‘‘For too long
colleges such as Davidson couid
be said to be geared for the
average student. While some
discipline is certainly necessary,
education can become too much
ritualized, like an established
church.”

There are, of course, barriers
in the path of a curricular
change. Johnston compared the
faculty to management, students
to labor and grades to wages.
Green stamps come in the form
of credits which after four
years the student can cash in
for a diploma.

This. is, of course. a highly
material and unhealthy educa-
tion and certainly not exciting

intellectually to the students or
the faculty, Johnston comment-
ed.

The second barrier is the fac-
ulty itself. Will the professors
who have been teaching the
same course for years forsake
their tired old notes?

The faculty, of course, must
be the ones to renew the curric-
ulum. ‘‘Professors,”’ said John-
ston, ‘“‘must never settle down.
The curriculum cannot operate
itself."

‘Liberal. education is an act
of discovery .. . one that re-
stores and reaffirms man’s own
nobility, his glory, his aims.

“This renewal’s purpose is to
keep the curriculum from freez-
ing. But we must go beyond
curriculum,. content and meth.
od to the heart of Jearning—
what is worth teaching and. how
to teach it.”

“There are three reasons for|:

this decrease in applications,”
White explained. “First. the
number of high school seniors
was larger in 1964-65 than in
any previous year. During 1966
the number fell considerably.

This decrease should continue].

throughout this year and then
begin to rise again in 1968.

“Second, with many new and
enlarging institutions, there are
many more openings for stu-
dents,’ White said. “Some uni-
versities are accepting 200-400
more students this year.”

White concluded by saying
that ‘“‘the decrease of applica-
tions could be caused by the
draft scare. Students who either
fail or do not take the Selective
Service Test are subject to the
draft unless they are in the top
half of their class.

“Some students.’ he = said.
“would settle for less challenge
by going to an easier school
than Davidson to be sure of get-
ting in the top half of their
class."

BILL SCHAFER IN ACTION
Getting There Is Half The Fun

ON WEEKENDS

Schafer Hops Freights

By TOM WHEATLEY
Staff Writer

The average student hitch-
hikes on weekends, but Bll
Schafer, a Davidson freshman,
hops freights for transportation.

Hitch-hiking is faster, he ad-
mits, but for someone who be-
Leves that getting there is half
the fun, freights are the only
way to go.

Since he came to Davidson,
Schafer has made three trips,
two by himself and one with a
companion.

A typical trip from Davidson
would begin at the Mooresville
junction to Winston-Salem or
Asheville. Beginning in an open
car, he sometimes can switch
to a better car at Statesville.

The best time to hop is during
the night or in a heavy fog in
order to avoid being seen.

Schafer says the most beau-
tiful trips that he has taken have

* been to Asheville, where he has

arrived at dawn with a clear
view of the autumn leaves.

Schafer has never been caught,
though he has been interrogat-
ed. Hopping trains is, according
to Schafer, “no more illegal than
hitch-hiking on an interstate.”

Railroads have always fasci-
nated Schafer. He wants to get
to know the workings of the rail-
roads, what makes them run
late, what causes inefficiency
and damage suits.

His hobby thus has a two-fold
purpose. The first is fun, the
second is to get to know-the ma-
neuvers of trains ‘“‘by being a
parcel post.”

New to the Southern System.
he has already hopped short dis-
tances on the Baltimore & Ohio,
the Missouri Pacific, the Penn-
sylvania and the Western Mary-
land lines.

He wants to take more exten-|'

sive trips in the future and visit
some big yards in order to get

APO also plans to have an ex-
panded scouting program in Da-
vidson and Mecklenburg County.

Carroll commented that APO
is still open for membership and
encouraged all interested stu-
dents to attend one of their meet-
ings, which are held on alter-
nate Tuesdays in the Green

Room of the College Union at

a more comprehensive view of
the whole railroad industry.

Interest has doubled at David-
son recently as Andy Bird, a
junior, made his first hop with
Schafer a couple of weeks ago.
Since this has been a very lone-
ly hobby to him in the past, he
is very glad to find ‘‘a kindred
spirit.”

The Interfraternity Council is
working on a plan to rotate
Richardson Scholars to several
fraternity houses for meals.

IFC President Mike Booe an-
nouneed that the plan was be-
ing coordinated by Dr. John D.
Kelton, psychology professor.
The schedule would probably
cali for the scholars to rotate
between six fraternity houses in
a period of six weeks. °

The purpose of the move, ac-
cording to Booe, is to help the
scholars get acquainted with fra-
ternity members. He said that
they would not each go to
the fraternities because it wou
be too difficult to get to know
alt the members.

The council also spoke of pre-
paring a let
