Dr. J. H. Henderlite
Talks at Y. MC. A.

“Other Side of Road” is Subject of
Helpful Address.

Dr. J. H. Henderlite, of Gastonia, N.
C., addressed the last regular meeting
of the Y. M. C. A,, on Thursday even-
ing. He chose as his subject, ‘“Ihe
Other Side of the Road,” as is brought
out in the parable of the Good Samari-
tan. He contrasted the two sides of the
road of life; the one a smooth and long
road followed by the sinful, the other
side marked by rough obstacles of self-
sacrifice and oftentimes short-lived, yet
always pursued by the righteous, “Ihe
Levite and the priest passed by on the
other side, altho it was plainly their
duty to render assistance to the wounded
man, as their vows exhorted them to aid
the sick and distressed. On the other
hand, it was not supposed that a Samari-
tan should aid a Jew, for he was of a
despised race, yet thru motives of kind-
ness for humanity he helped the wound-
ed man. Dr. Henderlite campared us
with the Good Samaritan, and showed
that it was plainly America’s duty to
rescue the fallen nations of the world.
Bleeding Belgium and Servia were call-
ing for us and we heeded the call.

This talk was indeed uplifting, giving
us a new perspective of our situation in
the world’s war.

Monday morning the following men
were elected as officers for the ccming
scholastic year: J. W. McAlister, pres-

Wildeats Win State
Track Meet With Ease

Team Wins 55 Out of a Possible
130 Points---Grey Stars

Davidson won in the State track meet
held Saturday on Emerson field, at
Chapel Hill, by scoring 55 out of a
possible 130 points. “Carolina took sec-
ond place with g1 1-3 points; ‘Trinity
third place, with 25 1-3 points, and Elon
fourth place, with 8 1-3 points.

“Wooly” Grey was easily the star of
the meet. Brand. was in splendid form,
lowering his former record of the mile
by several seconds, He did not show
up so well in the two mile, owing to the
fact that it was run just after the mile
race, and he was not in the best condi-
tion. Murray showed us something new,
a Freshman winning his “D" the first
trial. He won the broad jump, jumping
20 feet, 10 inches. McQueen was up to
his usual pace, easily winning the high
jump. Crouch also was “going good”
in taking the 440. But after all we again
look back upon our old “standback”
“Wooly.” He is always there with the
“stuff,” when it comes to handling the
weights. With his equipment of brawn
and muscle he always goes “over the
top” with the honors in his line. It
might also be mentioned that he led in
individual points scored. Davidson won
seven first places.

The following is the score by events:
100 yard dash, Wood, Carolina, Thomp-
son, Trinity, time 11 seconds; 440-yard
dash, Crouch, Davidson, Finley, David-
son, time 53 2-§ seconds; one-mile run,
Brand, Davidson, Smathers, Trinity, time
4 minutes 42 seconds; high hurdles,
