Kruse’s Cubby
Little guys
still gotta

dream big

By MIcHAEL KRUSE
Assistant Sports Editor

Ron Green, big cheese
sports columnist, began his lit-
erary masterpiece in yesterday’s
edition: “A banner behind one
basket at Belk Arena Saturday
read, ‘March Madness at
Davidson, Bring on UMass.’”

Milking the now legendary
sign for all its worth, he contin-
ued later, “They (the Wildcats)
know they have to take care of
business and leave the dream-
ing, for the moment, to the
people who hang the banners.”

Alas, how little you know,
almighty journalistic wise man.
I was the one who did the hang-
ing and the painting, after
hallmate Mike “Flashy Fresh-
man Wideout” Harrington of-
fered UMass as the appropriate
team.

Indeed, I am the person for
whom the dreaming at this mo-
ment is left.

Yes, me, the little guy, the
inferior Davidsonian journalist
wannabee who was, after the
game, standing next to you dur-
ing a Brandon Williams post-
game interview.

Remember me?

Probably not. That’s be-
cause Ron is not only on the
staff of a large metropolitan
paper, but he gets a little picture
of his head next to everything
he writes.

That means one of two
things in the journalism world:
you’re good or, ‘like in Ron’s

case, you covered glacier for- '

mation during the Ice Age.

But really, I must show
proper respect for good ol’ Ron.
I am not an Observerite. lama
Davidsonianite. I don’t even
get a little picture of my head
next to anything I write, let alone
everything I write.

I must admit though, he
was completely on the ball when
he dubbed the ever-apathetic
Belk horde “a tea and crumpets
crowd.”

And that, my friends, is all
too true. ;

Comeback falls short

Women make history against Catamounts only to drop heartbreaker

By MICHAEL KRUSE
Assistant Sports Editor

The women’s basketball team
had an unforgettable week, They
become the winningest team in
program history with a 69-60 vic-
tory at Western Carolina (8-14, 3-
7) on Monday, and then they fell to
Georgia Southern (13-10, 6-5),
100-97, in overtime on Saturday at
Belk Arena.

Basketball

Although the Wildcats (11-
10, 5-6) have shown flashes of
brilliance in this breakthrough sea-
son, inconsistency has plagued
them throughout. They won four
of their first six league games, but

" have now they lost four of their last

five.

The first half against GSU
exemplified the mercurial play, as
Davidson fell behind 20-6, only to
roar back and claim a 24-23 lead.
However, the Eagles then put to-
gether a 30-13 run of their own and
held a 53-37 advantage at the break.

Davidson trailed by as many
as 19 in the second half and faced
a seemingly insurmountable 15-
point deficit with just 7:48 remain-
ing:

But the Wildcats, wish reju-
venated emotion and intensity,
made up | 1 points in the final 2:50,
forcing overtime.

“When we play with intensity
like we did in the second half, we
play as well as any team in the

conference,” said head coach John
Filar.

Jessica Montrella tallied 6 of
her career-high 24 points, spark-
ing the comeback.

Down 85-77 with 1:42 left, a
Monica Winter (38 minutes, 6 as-

sists) free throw, Carolyn Kirsch
(20 points, 11 rebounds, 8 of which
were offensive) layup, Jennifer
Sanborn (a career-high 23 points
on 9-for-15 field goal shooting,
including 3-for-7 long-distance
marksmanship) driving lay-in, and

a dramatic Montrella three with 13
seconds left in regulation knotted
the score. .

Kristen Ferrucci added 15 .
points on 7-for-9 shooting.

A potentially game-winning
Kirsch layup attempt rattled out as
the buzzer sounded.

Overtime proved equally
thrilling, as a last-second Sanborn
three-pointer rimmed out, allow-
ing the Eagles to escape with the
narrow victory.

Said Filar, “When you see a
team play that hard, you want to
have some positive results. This
one hurts.”

Ferrucci starred in Monday’s
historic win over the Catamounts,
collecting 19 points and 8 rebounds.

Down 38-31 at halftime,
Davidson rallied in the second,
outscoring Western by 16 points to
claim its 11th win and first ever
season sweep of a league foe.

Kirsch and Montrella chipped
in 14 and 11 points, respectively,
and Jamie Brown ripped down 10
boards.

“We haven’t had the game of
our life yet. We haven’t had a
player who’s had the game of her
life yet,” said Filar, “It'll come. It
may just come at an unbelievable
time.”

Filar hopes that unbelievable
time will come in less than three
weeks at the conference tourna-
ment.

“We haven’ t put all our weap-
ons on the floor one time (because
of injuries),” he said, “So if any-
body will be ready to go at tourna-
ment time, it should be us.”

Wildcats roll to 20th win

Men’s Basketball Team rolls over East Tennessee St.

By MICHAEL KRUSE

‘Assistant Sports Editor

It’s almost getting to be too
routine. On a weekly basis,
Davidson squashes its Southern

. Conference opponents.

Men’s Basketball

After manhandling East Ten-
nessee St. (7-14, 3-7), 96-66, on
Tuesday in Johnson City, and
bombing The Citadel (10-12, 5-6),
82-54, on Saturday in Belk Arena,
the Wildcats stand at 20-3 overall,
including an 11-0 league record.

They are currently riding a
14-game unbeaten streak, tied for
the third longest in school history,
and have triumphed in 17 of their
last 18 contests.

“This team has put me on au-
tomatic pilot,” said coach Bob
McKillop following the Citadel
whipping, “My confidence in them

is reaching upward. That’s a very
comforting feeling.”

“I think we’re the best team in
the conference and I don’t think
we should lose the rest of the year,”
added Mark McGuire.

Brandon Williams summed
it up: “It would be hard not to be
confident.”

Davidson jumped out to a 20-
6 lead in the first six minutes and
continued to dominate the Bull-
dogs throughout the first half, lead-
ing 46-27 at the break.

The overmatched Citadel
managed to shave the lead to 15
with 6:46 left in the contest, but
successive jams by Ray Minlend
and Williams triggered a 16-3
game-ending spurt, as the Wild-
cats clinched at least.a tie for the
conference’s North Division title.

Williams notched a game-high
23 points, hitting 4 of 5 from be-
hind the arc. In the last three out-
ings, he is 9-for-12 on three-point-
ers. Chris Alpert and Mark

Donnelly also reached double fig-
ures, bucketing 12 and 10, respec-
tively. Alpert recorded six assists
and four steals as well.

Quinn Harwood, Narcisse’

Ewodo (team-best eight boards),
and Minlend added eight points
apiece and Jeff Anderson had six.

Virgil Stevens led the Citadel
with 11.

Tuesday’s victory was just as
convincing, as the Wildcats held a
14-point halftime lead en route to
their second 30-point throttling of
ETSU in a month.

Davidson shot 55% from the
floor and 76% from the line, while
the Bucs floundered, hitting 46%
from the floor and an anemic 41.%
(9-22) of their free throws.

Williams posted a team-high
19. points, while Harwood added
17, Minlend 16, Anderson 14, and
Donnelly 13. Williams and Ewodo
each recorded eight rebounds.

Justin McClellan, the only Buc
in double figures, tallied 12,

and The Citadel

As a team, Davidson dished
out 25 assists (including a season-
best 9 from Alpert), as ETSU mus-
tered just 12.

“T don’t know how good this
team can get, (but) I thought the
way we played tonight was as good
as we’ ve been all year, if not better
than we’ve been all year,”
McKillop said, “This was a very
convincing victory.”

The Wildcats look to remain
undefeated in the conference
against a pair of tough opponents
this week, traveling to VMI to-
night and hosting Marshall on Sat-
urday at 2:30 p.m. on SportSouth.

“VMI plays with great energy
and it’s going to be a very chal-
lenging game for us, but a kind of
challenge you want at this part of
the season to prepare you for con-
ference. tournament play,” said
McKillop.

As Williams said, “It’s our
heart that won't let us lose right
now.”
