‘Cats Play Well in Wednesday Loss to Demon Deacons

By Bruce Balestier

Since early January, the
Davidson basketball team has been
consistently good for one (and only
one) thing; it has played well
against every good team it has
faced, capturing a win against
Miami and falling twice by close
margins to UNCC. The trend con-
tinued Wednesday in Winston-
Salem, when the Wildcats gave
Wake Forest a scare before losing
76-62.

Strangely, it was a game that
Davidson really had a chance to

win. Jason Zimmerman’s three-
pointer as time expired in the first
half cutthe Wake lead to 43-35 and
gave Davidson a heap of momen-
tum. The ‘Cats capitalized on that
momentum from the very outset of
the second half. They began the
period with an 11-2 run in which
they thoroughly outplayed the
Deacons; Detlef Musch’s slam off
a lob pass from J.D. Heuer gave
Davidson a 46-45 lead with 14:22
to play.

At first glance, Davidson’s per-
formances in the Southern States
Swimming and Diving Champi-
onships, held Feb. 14-16 at Can-
non Pool, appear average; the men
finished sixth out of eleven
schools, while the women placed
eighth.

What are impressive are the tre-
mendous advances which became
the trademark of this year’s
squads. Given that this is
Davidson’s first year of varsity
swimmingand diving since 1982,
the ‘Cats accomplishments in the
Southern States seem to be just
rewards for the diligent effort
exerted in adjusting to Division I
competition,

“We were still improving at the
final meet,” headcoach Ron Mor-
row said. “I'expected strong ef-
forts, considering we were in the
championship, but we did much
better than expected.”

‘The mens’ and womens’ teams
combined to place 27 individuals
and eight relays in the finals of
theirrespective events. Final point.
totals stood at 232 for the men
and 146 for the women.

Thad Reece, who captured fifth
in the one-meter dive and seventh
in the three-meter, led all
Davidson competitors with 26
points. Morgan Farrell, who won
the consolation heats (good for

butterfly and 400 individual
with 18 points. Hayler Osborn’s

breaststroke paced his 16-point

showing in the womens’ one-me-
ter paced her 12-point total. She
was followed closely by Audrey
Schuetz, who captured twelfth in
the 100 butterfly and totaled 10
points. Tracey Barwick’s thir-
teenth-place showing in the 100
freestyle added to her 6-point ef-
fort, and Amy Laukkanen picked
up twelfth in the 200 backstroke
and 5 overall points. Miche Bas-
kett contributed three points, and
Kristie Moss added 2 to the ‘Cats
total.

Assistant Coach Tricia Smith
focused on the ‘Cats prepared-
ness and focus at the champion-
ships. “I was very pleased and
impressed at the way we rallied to
bring our swimming and diving
up a level,” she said.

An added benefit for competi-
tors in the Southern States will
not be fully realized until next
Tuesday. “CBS This Morning”
recorded all the swimmers and
diversas they collectively wished
all viewers a good morning, and
the segment is scheduled to air
March 3.

According to Morrow, there is
astrong possibility that the South-
ern States will be held at Davidson
again next season, He said that
the school has yet to decide if it
wants to hold the championships,
buthe stressed that Davidson isin
a position to “assume the leader-
shiprolein developing the South-
ern States Conference.”

He continued to express his
gratitude to the Davidson town
andcollege communities for their

backing throughout the season

Owens gave Wake the lead at 49-
46, but Jason Zimmerman made a
three-pointer with 10:10 left to tie
itat49. The Deacons proceeded to
score 11 points in succession, led
by Owens and Chris King, and
took a 60-49 lead. George Spain’s
three-point play with 6:26 left
brought the Wildcats within 62-
54, but they could come no closer.
Wake made 6-8 free throws in the
final minute to account for the final
margin.

Davidson’s poised perform-
ance against the Wake Forest pres-

sure drew the respect of Deacon
point guard Derrick McQueen. “I
thought this game was justas tough
as an ACC game,” he said. “The
way they handled themselves down
the stretch and handled our pres-
sure, they did an excellent job.”

The game excited Davidson
coach Bob McKillop, who seemed
to see success in the distance for
his struggling team. ““We’re close,
we’re so close,” he said. “It’s a
matter now of going out and doing
it.”

But the ‘Cats’ fine perform-

ance also raised a familiar ques-
tion; namely, how can a team play
so well against good teams and so
poorly much of the time against
lesser teams. While the knee-jerk
reaction is to say that the team gets
up only for big games, McKillop
insists that this is not so. Instead,
he says, there is simply something
in the Big South matchups that

‘affects the team adversely. But

what that is is anyone’s guess.
Musch and Janko Narat each
scored 15 points to lead Davidson.

Once Again, Day Leads Radford Over 'Cats

By Bruce Balestier

Davidson, a 67% free-throw
shooting team on the year, allowed
Radford just enough breathing
room by shhoting 9-21 from the
line, and the Highlanders’ Doug
Day scored 27 points, including 12
in a pivotal second-half run, as
Radford claimed an 89-75. win
Saturday in Radford, Va. The
Wildcats fell to 2-8, 7-16 with the
loss, their seventh straight.

Day wentona 12-Orun during
the first two minutes of the second
half by hitting four three-pointers,
the final two from NBA range. The
run turned Radford’s 40-36
halftime lead into a 52-36 bulge
with 18:02 to play, and the Wild-
cats could never completely re-
cover from it.

But that’s not to say that
Davidson didn’t make things inter-
esting. The ‘Cats responded to
Day’s run with a 9-0 run of their
ownto pull within 52-45, butcould

not getoverthe hump. TheRadford
lead was six points, at 64-58, after
Frank Harris hit a hanging shot in
the lane with 5:31 left. Solid
Davidson defense on the follow-
ing possession forced Day into an
errant three-pointer from the right
baseline, butthe Highlanders’ Tom
Gallaher grabbed the offensive re-
bound and scored to make it 66-58.
Radford guard Chris Hawkins’
pullup jumper on the next posses-
sion gave his team a 68-58 advan-
tage and effectively ended the
game. With the Wildcats forced to
foul, Radford made 13 of 16 foul
shots in the final 2:51 to take the
win.

Davidson stayed close to
Radford in the first half despite an
excessive amount of missed op-
portunities, most of them from the
free throw line. The ‘Cats shot 5-
13 from the line in the first half;
Janko Narat, an 85% foul shooter,
twice missed the front end of one

and one situations. Forward J.D.
Heuer scored 12 points in the half;
his baseline jumper gave Davidson
its last lead at 15-14, and his bank
in the lane with 10. seconds left in
the half brought the Wildcats within
38-36.

Davidson coach Bob McKil-
lop saw the missed opportunities
of the first half as critical to the
outcome. He said that it would
have been a different game “if we
[had made] our free throws and hit
our layups in thé/first half.”

Detlef Musch overcame a
passive first half with an effective
second half,and led Davidson with
17 points. Heuer, in his first start
since November 1990, played a
solid all-around game, Scoring 14
points, grabbing six ‘Tebounds,
passing for four assists and com-
mitting zero tumovers. Janko Narat
and Harris each scored 13 points;
Narat also grabbed 13 rebounds.
