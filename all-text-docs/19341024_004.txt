There may have been better football
games played in this country since the
game began, but I have never seen one
that could equal the duel the Wildcats
held with Duke’s Blue Devils Saturday.
That game had everything that one could
ask Por in a perfect game. There were
plays of all sorts, and some of the pret-
tiest execution that has ever been ex-
hibited on Richardson Field.

“Jumping Joe’’ Wingfield came
into his own Saturday, and thrilled
the fans on several occasions by
bouncing out of one hefty Wade-
man’s arms after the other. He
did a particularly nice job of punt
returning. Those big Devil lines-
men simply couldn’t stop him be-
fore he had lugged the leather at
least a few yards. This gent’man
is what one would commonly call
a “sweet running back’’.

Of course, Johnny Mackorell and Jim
Morgan played their usual excellent jam-
up game, with Charlie Forte and Henry
Cathey sharing honors for their play in
the forward wall, and we could go ahead
and mention every man on the team, both
backs and linemen, because they were all
in there doing their stuff Saturday.

The great difference, that I saw
between Davidson and Duke on the
field from the standpoint of foot-
ball playing was the more experi-
enced way in which the Devils ad-

ed their rough . They
have practised this type of play
considerably more than the ’Cats

and quently the 'y

part used by them was a little bet-

ter camouflaged, which made it less
costly.

The Wildcats were victims of two
costly breaks, both of which resulted in
Duke touchdowns before the Newton-
McEver gridsters could recuperate. The
first’ came when Duke began her first
sustained drive, and Davidson suffered
a penalty for unnecessary roughness,
which put the Durham club within easy
scoring distance. The other was an in-
tercepted pass, which the fast stepping
Johnston, Duke halfback, carried to the
Davidson 12-yard line. These, of course,
are a part of the game, but had they not
taken place in this .particular contest it
would have been a very different story
for the assistant mentors of the Blue
Devils to tell their famous football papa,
Mr. Wallace Wade, when the crew gets
together again.

I don’t deny that Duke was bet-
ter than Davidson Saturday, but I
do insist that the final score of the
game that took place on Richard- *‘
son field that afternoon is no true
indication of the difference in the
way the two teams showed up in
the contest. There certainly was
not more than a one touchdown
leeway for the Dukes.

Charleston will be the scene of the
next Wildcat engagement, and 4f the
sand flies don’t eat any of the Felines
before game time I think the Wildcats
will begin with the Citadel corterie a
winning streak that can only be stopped
by the end of the season, That includes
some pretty tough foes, but the New-
tonites are as tough as anything they have
to play from now on.

I like this chance-taking type of
football the present Davidson

WILDCATS FACE
CADET ELEVEN
AT CHARLESTON

Both Teams Expected To Use
Passing Attack In Inter-
state Battle

WILDCATS LEAVE FRIDAY
Will Be Thirteenth Meeting Of
Davidson And “The
Citadel”

In their last game away from their
home field, the Davidson Wildcats will
journey to Charleston this week-end to
encounter Coach. Tatum Gessette’s Cita-
del Bulldogs.

It will the fourteenth gridiron
meeting of the two schools, the series
having begun in 1909 when the teams
fought to a scoreless tie. However, in
later years, the Presbyterians have ac-
cumulated a decided edge on the Cadets.

Both teams were decisively defeated
by strong foes during the past. week.
The South Carolina Gamecocks trounced
Citadel 20-6 last Thursday at the
Orangeburg fair, and Davidson bowed
before the mighty Duke Blue Devils,
20-0. However, even in defeat both
teams showed strong offensive power,
and. their coming contest should be quite
spirited. Neither eleven has a very
clean record so far. The Wildcats have
lost to N. C. State, Army, and Duke,
while the Bulldogs have been defeated by
Oglethorpe, George ‘Washington Univer-
sity, and South Carolina.

Coaches Newton and McEver are con-
tinuing to work steadily on the passing
attack which was so successful against
Duke. They hope to bring to even higher
perfection the aerial combination of
Captain Mackorell, Wingfield, and Hut-
chens, teamed up with Morgan and Wind-
ham at end.

Coach Tatum Gessette will probably
count’ largely on Ed Hall and Levi for
punting duty, while in the running back-
field he will have such backs as Billy
Workman, Ferguson, Andy Hall, and
Faulkner. Besides these men Captain
Billy Symmes will probably be in uni-
form Saturday in spite of an early sea-
son foot injury. Symmes is recognized
as one of the best pivot men in the Pal-
metto state.

Both teams will send excellent kickers
on the field Saturday in’ Mackorell and
Pittman for the Wildcats, and-Levi and
Hall for the Bulldogs. Ed Hall showed
up well in the George Washington game
two weeks ago, and Paul Pittman has
an average for the season of about forty-
five yards per punt.

The record of the Dayidson-Citadel
football series since 1909 is‘as follows:

1909 Citadel 0 Davidson )
1910 Citadel 6 Davidson 27
1914 Citadel 0 Davidson 16

Indians Call-Off Game
With Cats; Date Open

The Davidson-William and Mary
football game originally scheduled
to be played here on Saturday, No-
vember 10, has been definitely can-
celled The complications in the
schedule of the Virginia team came
first when there was a conflict on
that date with V. M. I. due to an
error in the arrangement of the
schedule. After both William and
Mary and V. M. I. had found it im-
possible to change the dates of any
of their games, the Wildcats agreed
to play on Thursday, November 1,
giving W & M a total of three games
in the same week.

This condition brought about the
objections of the parents of the
players and compelled them to for-
feit the game.

Several attempts have been made
to fill the date left open by this con-
flict, but nothing definite has been
determined at this time

There is a possibility that the date
will remain open, and if this is the
case, persons who hold season
passes to all Davidson games on the
campus will be returned the propor-
tionate equivalent in cash money, or,
if they wish, an additional ticket to
the V. M. I. game on November 17. :

DAVIDSON FROSH
ARE DOWNED BY
VP 1. CADETS

Hogan, Nichelson, Dennis, Laffer-
ty And Overall Outstanding
For Kittens

NEW AMPLIFIER USED

Cregger, Henry, and Doxey Star
For Gobblers

In their first intercollegiate clash of
the season last Friday, October 19th, the
Davidson Wildkittens bowed to the V.
P. I. yearlings by a score of 12-2.

Viewed by a large crowd, the scrap-
ping Kittens met their defeat at the
hands of a heavy and powerful plebe
eleven. Playing in their own territory
most of the time they were power-
less against an onslaught which netted
two touchdowns for the visitors.

All scoring was done in the first and
third quarters; V. P. I. making one
touchdown in each and Davidson getting
a safety in the first.

Hogan, captain, Nichelson, Dennis,
Lafferty and Overall were outstanding
for Davidson while Cregger, Henry, and
Doxey were the main threats for the
cadets. ‘Touchdowns were made_ by
Doxey and Cregger. Cregger also fell
on the ball behind his own goal to turn
a possible touchdown into a safety, and
played spectacular football throughout
the game, being the only V. P. I. man
to run with the ball in the third quarter.

V. P. I. won the toss up and chose to
receive, defending the south goal. Ho-
gan kicked for the Wildkittens. After
a 16 yard runback by Cregger, the Cadets
were unable to gain and were forced to
kick,

Doxey’s punt was fumbled by Lafferty
and recovered by a V. P. I. man on the
Davidson 39 yard line to start the, visi-
tor’s on their first scoring spree: early
in the game. A slight gain through the
line was followed by a pass from Creg-
ger to Henry, who was stopped on the
17 yard line.

After a penalty and an incompleted
pass, the Plebes again slashed out toward
the goal line, and easily made their first
counter with pass from Henry to
Doxey.

The only two scoring threats of the
Kittens also came in the first quarter.
The kickoff after the visitor’s touch-
down went to Hogan who advanced it
from his own 30 to V. P. I.’s 36 yard
line. A pass from Dennis to Lafferty
placed the ball on the 14 yard mark.
Hogan slashed through left guard for
10 yards and a first down.

On the next play, Lafferty carried the
ball around left end to the 2 yard
stripe. The next two plays lost seu
for the ’Kittens as the "Tech elever
tightened its defense. The last down
featured a pass from Dennis to Hogan
who was stopped on the one yard line,
and Davidson lost the ‘ball on downs.

Again in the same quarter, Lafferty
of Davidson made what was probably
the most spectacular run of the day
when he ran back a punt 45 yards to
the Cadet’s 5 yard line. The following
downs found the ’Kittens without that
final punch to put the ball over and they
lost the ball on downs to the visitors.

Following this, in the last minute of
the eventful first quarter, an attempted
punt by Doxey was blocked by Davidson

Lead Duke Assault

Richardson field is well groom-
ed today, for the 13th meeting be-
tween the Duke Blue Devils and
Davidson’s fighting Wildcats.

The weather is perfect, with a trace
of coolness in the air, which is made to
order for football. Chalk marks upon a
field of green stand out, while a color-
ful crowd seeps into the already filled
stadium.

Both teams are fiow taking the field
for the initial warm-up preparatory to the
game. The brilliant red uniforms of the
cats blend with the dark blue of the
heavier Duke team.

Mackorell, Davidson's ace of aces. Duke
wins the toss and elects to receive.

Alexander receives Mackorell’s
kick-off, fumbles and then re-
covers. “Ace” Parker slashes
through the Wildcat line for 4
yards. Parker then kicks to Mac-
korell, a long one, and Mackorell

from his 17 to the 30. Mackorell
quickly fires a bullet pass to Big
Jim Morgan for ten yards. Jim
swerves to the right and as two
Blue Devil backs storm in for the
kill, he laterals to the flying Wing-
field. ‘‘Booty’’ races across _mid-
field and is downed on Duke’s 40
for a net gain of 30 yards.
Yarborough makes 6 through Duke’s

line, Wingtield one, and two passes drop

over the end zone, which ends Davidson's

first threat.

tain Dunlap. End of first quarter.

Score, Duke 7; Davidson 0.

After receiving a punt, Cornelius,
Alexander, and Parker drive to David-
son’s 27 yard line. Ebie Dunlap is in-
jured and leaves game. On next try,
Alexander is stopped by Siewers for no
gain.

Yarborough and Wingfield to-
gether net 8 yards. Time out for
Duke with Captain Dunlap injured.
He is carried from the field, after
playing a fine game.

Johnson returns Mackorell’s
