MANY AGONISTICS

Coach “Doc” Unger’s wrestling team
got off to a brilliant start by their three
victories last week. Those wins were
quite decisive, too, which is most gratify-
ing, because the teams met included some
grapplers who have been among the best
in amateur circles.

I think Wildcat supporters can
look to this outfit to come through
with a brilliant season on the mat.
Coach Unger is not only an ex-
tremely well qualified tutor, but
he has probably the largest group
of agonistically inclined stalwarts
to work with this winter that have
ever reported for the team at Dav-
idson.

It is very true that few of these men
have had previous experience before com-
ing to Davidson, but with the leadership
of Charlie Fort to inspire them and the
faithful instruction of Unger to show
them how it should be a well producing
aggregation,

GREATEST WILDCAT
Captain Johnny Mackorell con-

tinues to be glorified, and the long-
er honors come the better they
get. He started off by receiving an
honorable mention on the Asso-
ciated Press all-America selection,
he then garnered a halfback posi-
tion with the all-state eleven, next
he was chosen as quarterback on
the little all-America first team,
and Sunday morning The Char-
lotte Observer pictured him with
Carolina’s all - America guard,
George Barclay, as co-captains of
the all-South Atlantic football
team.

Mackorell is probably the greatest grid
warrior that has even been produged in
the Davidson camp. Certainly he has
brought more publicity and praise upon
himself and his college than any other
protege of Presbyterian coaches.

Not only is his athletic prowess
of the first rank, but his name
graces the Dean’s listczin scholar-
ship, and the last report recorded
under his nomenclature in the Reg-
istrar’s office shows nothing but
A's and B’s, mostly the former.

Too much praise can’t be directed to-
ward this exceptional Wildcat, he. de-
serves it and he can take &.

STARS ON AI.LABAMA

Looking over the football records of
the 1934 season it can-he very) clearly
observed that “stars are still falling on
Alabama.” On every All-America foot-

“ball selection that has been published thus
far, the names of at least ‘two members
of the South’s Rose Bowl representative
have appeared.

The most outstanding men on
this very unusual eleven are Mil-
lard “Dixie” Howell, halfback,
Don Hutson, end, and Bill Lee,
tackle. These have all been ac-
corded all-America berths on va-
rious picks.

The choice of this edition of the Crim-
son Tide as bearer of the east’s gridiron
tidings to the Pacific Coast-jn the Tour-
nament of Roses at Pasadena on New
Year’s Day, is the ultimate fact of recog-
nition that Coach Frank Thomas has
vindicated his ability as'a worthy suc-
cessor to the celebrated Wallace Wade,
who, while serving as head mentor at the
University of Alabama, marshalled his
charges in the beautiful Rose Bowl.

Felix has already picked the
Southerners to bring home the ba-

For 1935 Season

PLAY TWENTY GAMES

Wildcats Will Have Eight Games
Here During Season

With five Varsity lettermen returning
to the court this year, prospects for the
1934-35 basketball team look unusually
bright. According to present indications
Davidson will have one of the best quin-
tets in several seasons:

Only two of last year’s lettermen, Mack
Holland, and John Lafferty, were lost
by graduation. Those returning are Capt.
Charlie Harris, forward; Hugh Yelver-
ton, Cole Windham, and Jim Morgan,
guards; and Courtney Ross, center.

To supplement this list are several
stellar players from last season's Fresh-
man team: Dick Cathey, Ken Knorr,
Maurice Peabody, Lefty Porter, and Bill
Quick.

The basketeers will meet 21 foes, play-
ing two before Christmas with 8 home
games during the season. Not listed on
the schedule below are games with Er-
skine and Wake Forest which will both
be played here at an undecided date.

The schedule:

Dec. 15—Charlotte “Y,” here.

Fraternity Basketball
Will Start In January

i

Pairings for the Inter-Fraternity bas-
ketball tournament, to be run off immed-
iately following the Christmas holidays,
came from Heath Whittle’s office Mon-
day. This tournament will mark the half
way point in the program of winter-and
spring sports for the fraternities on the
hill.

After compiling the points aggregated
in the first two sports, football and volley
ball, it is revealed that Kappa Sigma
and Sigma Phi Epsilon are tied for first
place with 27'4 points apiece. Kappa
Alpha runs a close third, having amassed
a total of 22% points. In former Inter-
Fraternity competition this year, the Kap-
pa Sig’s victory in football started them
out in the lead.

The Pikas were runners-up and the
S.P.E.’s and K.A.’s tied for the third
place position. The S.P.E.’s were vic-
torious in the volley ball tournament,
the K.A.’s took second, and the S.A.E,’s
and Kappa Sig’s tied for third place.

There should be keen interest in the
basketball tourney, as there remains only
baseball and varsity competition after
its completion. The K.A.’s hold the
title from last year—the S.P.E.’s were
runners-up. A ball may -be procured
from Heath Whittle at any time, if any
fraternity wishes to take advantage of
early practice. No man is eligible for
play if he has won his numeral or var-
sity letter in this sport and no man
can compete during his spring training
in football or track. This provision is
made to prevent injuries of any kind
during this period.

All teams, with the exception of the

K.A.’s and S.P.E.’s will enter the second

Seniors Conquer Freshmen

15-7 In Basketball Play-Off

Soccer Tournament To
Begin Play This Week

Class Teams Practice For First
Organized Soccer Games On
Campus

A new form of sport will make its de-
but at Davidson this week when the new
intra-mural soccer tournament between
classes gets under way. Although a few
students have played soccer on the cam-
pus during the past few years, this is
its first appearance as a regular organ-
ized sport.

The innovation is being received en-
thusiastically, and the class teams have
been practicing faithfully for over a
week. A large number of men have come
out for these practice sessions, and they
have elected captains for the various
teams as follows: Senior, Bob Coit; Jun-
ior, A. H. Haake; Sophomore, Kenneth
Scott; and Freshman, C. R. Bixler.

The first game of the tournament is
scheduled for Thursday afternoon be+
tween the Seniors and Freshmen. On
Friday afternoon the Juniors will play
the Sophomores. There will be no games
next week, and the tournament will be
completed after the holidays.

In introducing soccer Davidson is fall-
ing in with the trend of modern sport.
The game originated many years ago in
England, but has spread now all over
the world. It has the distinction of be-
ing the only sport involving a large team
that has had a place in the Olympic
games.

Soccer is played on a field the size
of a regulation football field. There is
a goal at each end of the field through
which the players endeavor to kick the
ball. On the whole the rules closely
resemble basketball, except that the ball
must be kicked instead of passed. The
ball may be propelled by any part of the
body except the hands, arms and shoul-
ders.

Each team consists of eleven players.
They consist of one goalkeeper, the only
man who can touch the ball with his
hands; two fullbacks, who play only on
the defense; three halfbacks, who play
both defense and offense; two wings,
who guard the side lines; two insides,
the chief offensive players; and a center.

round by virtue of a bye. The winner
of this game will meet the Pi Kappa
Phi’s in'the second round. Other second
round matches are as_ follows: Beta
Theta Pi vs. S.A.E., Phi Gamma Delta
vs. Kappa Sigma, and Phi Delta Theta

vs.°Pi Kappa Alpha.

JUNIORS TAKE THIRD

Keiswetter And Martin Are Out-
standing For Yearlings

The Seniors swamped the Freshmen in
the play-off match of the inter-class bas-
ketball tournament Monday night, Dec.
3, by a score of 15-7.

The different class teams finished in
the following order: Seniors, Freshmen,
Juniors, and Sophomores. Each team
played twice and the play-off was necessi-
tated by each of the two final teams
winning six games.

Led by Capt. Lawrence Reid, the
Freshmen defeated the Seniors in one of
the early round matches 19-18, This
game was featured by quick passing and
the accurate goal shooting of Freshmen
?reacher Martin and Bill Keiswetter. The
Freshmen team was composed of “Sky”
Cline, Keiswetter, Martin, Ellwood Moy-
er, and Reid.

The Sophomores failed to win a game
in the entire tournament, nevertheless
they gave some of the winning teams
a tough fight. In a semi-final game
with the Seniors the last year men bare-
ly eeked-out a victory with avl2-7 score.
Leonard Woodard and “Sandy” Moffet
showed up well for the Centennials, ‘The
Sophomore team was Lewis Crew, “San-
dy” Moffet, Frank Purdy, John Sadler,
and Leonard Woodard.

Led by Capt. Bill Bell, the Juniors
defeated the Sophomores in a second
round match 13-7, Both teams played
well but the passing of Bell and the goal
shooting of Don Stewart proved too big
an obstacle fof the second year men.
The Junior players were Bill Bell, Mar-
tin Barnett, Earl Frazier, George Leukal,
Joe McNabb, Hunter McClung, and Don
Stewart.

The Seniors’ victorious team was com-
posed of Dud Elvery, Archie Legare,
Colin Munroe, Archie McFayden, “Wim-
pey” Ravenel, and C. M. Yager.

FORT LEADS MATES TO —
THREE STRAIGHT WINS

Spray, Draper And High Point
Y.M.C.A. Teams Fall Before
Davidson Onslaught

QUARTERMAN UNBEATEN

Moffett And Dillon Show Prom-
ising Lightweight Talent

Charlie Fort, 175 pound captain of the
latest edition of Wildcat wrestlers, led
his teammates into three decisive vic-
tories over Y.M.C.A. teams from Spray,
Draper and High Point last week.

Van Dillon, 125 pound man, and Law-
rence Quarterman, in the 165 pound
bracket, were two others who came
through with three wins to more clearly
light the way for the ’Cats. ‘These pre-
liminary victories were over Spray “Y,”
22-10; Draper “Y,” 21-13, and High
Point “Y,” 21-9,

Coach “Doc” Unger on commenting
upon the results of these opening en-
gagements stated that much work in fun-
damentals was needed by the new men
but that he was confident that the team
would come through with a successful
season. ‘The official season opens after
exams and will include Duke, Carolina,
State and several other Southern Con-
ference teams.

The heavier weight divisions seem
pretty well cared for this year but there
is much competition for posts in the
lighter bracket. Polk Moffett, 118 pound
lightweight, turned in three noble per-
formances, winning two and losing to
the High Point man after being steamed
to reduce poundage.

The prospects for a successful year
seem all the more bright when consider-
ing the ability of the opposing men.
Draper produced three All - Southern
Y.M.C.A. wrestlers and High Point in
the forms of Jim McLaurin and Bill No-
lan presented two All-Southern Confer-
ence wrestlers from State, who won their
matches only by time advantages.

Jim Hodgin, 175 pounds, turned in good
work, although forced twice to fight
outside his weight limit. Owen, 145, and
Knox Thompson, 135, chalked up two
victories for a percentage of .666.

The High Point “Y” team returns to
the campus next Saturday afternoon to
try to seize revenge from that band of
Wildcats who so rudely mishandled them
the preceding Saturday. Bringing a new
threat, Percy Idle, a former unlimited
Carolina grappler, they hope to put up
a more formidable showing. Idle will
meet the captain of the ’Cats, Charles
Fort, who promises that it will be no
idle engagement that afternoon,

There were two exhibition matches in
last week’s schedule and Davidson split
evenly. Walker of Spray was defeated
by Parker of Davidson in 1 minute and
59 seconds time advantage and Moore
of Davidson lost by a fall to Squires
of Draper after 7 minutes.

Statistics’ for the Spray-Davidson
match: 118 pounds, Moffett (D) over
Taylor, 4:53 time advantage; 126 pounds,
Dillon (D) over Wade, 3:20 fall; 135
pounds, Thompson {D) over Murphy,
4:31 time advantage; 145 pounds, Owen
