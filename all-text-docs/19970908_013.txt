Ukrop in ‘92: Man among boys

Now a pro, inspiring kids with message of hard work

This is another in an ongoing
series of articles commemorating
the fifth anniversary of the men’s
soccer team’s miraculous run to the
1992 NCAA Final Four at
Richardson Field.

RICHMOND, Va. — Rob
Ukrop was, as fellow 1992 Wildcat
captain Matt Spear would say, a
man among boys that year.

Using a quick-trigger release,
booming right foot, and an uncanny
ability to be in the right place at the
tight time, Ukrop dominated the
college. soccer world.

“It was a great situation for
ne,” he said. “I had no defensive
responsibilities. I was always in the
box, and that’s where I’m most ef-
fective.”

What Ukrop did in 1992,
though — and during his entire
Davidson career, for that matter —
went way, way beyond mere effi-
cacy.

“Rob” — whose license plate
in 1992 read, “H8S2LSE” — “is
somebody who is very competi-
tive,” coach Charlie Slagle said ina
recent interview. “Anytime he gets
challenged, he rises to the chal-
lenge. We tried to put him in a
position where it would emphasize
what his strengths were.

“We didn’t make him run
around alot. We got him the balla
lot, and as quickly as we could. We
tried to give him as many opportu-
nities as possible, knowing he would
do something with them.”

And do something he did.

As the nation’s most potent
scorer in 1992 — 31 goals and 10
assists for an astronomical 72 points
— the first-team All-American
striker represented the consistent
individual offensive output so criti-
cal to any championship-caliber
soccer team.

In leading the non-scholarship
Wildcats to a 17-5-5 record and a
most improbable berth in the na-
tional semifinals, the veteran striker
garnered All-Southern Conference,
All-South, and All-American acco-
lades; earned the Adi Dassler Me-
morial Award, given to college
soccer’s most outstanding. senior;
and was one of three finalists for
National Player of the Year.

All told, Ukrop amassed 76
goals and 32 assists for an astound-
ing 184 career points — by far the
most prolific overall output for any
Davidson soccer player ever.

Ukrop, certainly the most deco-
rated athlete in school history and
arguably the most legendary, had a
certain intangible something Ital-
ian soccer aficionados call
“malicia,” meaning a striker’s abil-
ity to sting.

“Just the ability to beat you,”

Spear explained in an August inter- *

view.

He beat UNC Charlotte in the
first round of the NCAA tourna-
ment, converting a bicycle kick to
give the Wildcats a 2-1 overtime
advantage.

nent North Carolina St. with a dra-

As a

bally-

fourth-
year star
in 1991,
Ukrop
suffered a broken left leg in the
second game of the season against
North Carolina.

While many saw the injury as a
disaster — and, ultimately, it did
prove disastrous for the 1991 Wild-
cats, who sputtered to an 8-10-2
mark without him — Ukrop, al-
ways the optimist, saw an opportu-
nity, and elected to take a medical
redshirt and return for a grand fi-
nale.

“T thought, this is a great op-
portunity to get a medical redshirt,
to come back,” Ukrop said over
lunch last month here in his home-
town. “Great things can happen.”

A combination of nerves and
stomach upset made the night be-
fore the national semifinal against
San Diego a restless one for Ukrop.

“He didn’t sleep a wink the
night before the game,” Spear re-
called. “I remember coming to
Baker around.4 p.m. to get taped
and get ready. And I saw Rob
sitting there on one of the couches
in the lobby kind of half-crying,
half-choking, trying to get ahold of
himself.

‘He had just done an interview

He said that he felt sick, but I think
he was sick because he felt nervous.
He never fully said that, but he had
reason to have nerves. He was the

times, but in this game it was much
more important. He knew we
needed his example out there.”

And, battling nerves and fa-
tigue, Ukrop was — relatively
speaking, of course — a virtual
non-factor versus the Toreros.

To this day, Ukrop adamantly
says that the Wildcats would have
beaten powerhouse Virginia had
they made it to Sunday’s national
championship.

“No doubt about it,” he said.
“They were a very confident team,
but so were we. -I feel they would
have had trouble matching up with
us. We had an unorthodox style,
and we were the ultimate team. But
we couldn’t get past San Diego.”

Nonetheless, forthe Richmond
native, nothing has ever come close
to rivaling 1992 — and it’s highly
unlikely anything ever will.

His professional soccer career
has been somewhat of a letdown
after his dream-like tenure at
Davidson. For someone so team-
oriented, the fiercely individualis-
tic style in minor league soccer —
everyone out there has one goal: to
crack an MLS roster — is troubling.

 Althoughhe enjoyeda 16-game
stint with the MLS’s New England
Revolution in 1996 — including
nine starts — Ukrop has never been
on a team as tight-knit as the 1992
Wildcats. :

“To me, at no point in the sea-
son, was ‘it about me scoring a cer-
tain amount of goals,’’ Ukrop said.
