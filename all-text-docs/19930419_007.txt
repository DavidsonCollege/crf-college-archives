Davidson's Housekeeping Staff Deserves More Respect

By Marilyn Ambroise

Many African-American men
and women have given years of
their lives to Davidson. These
great men and women see to it that
the buildings on this campus re-
main in top condition. But I am
afraid that the college community
is oblivious of this fact. Why do I
say this? I'll tell you.

Icannotbegin to tell you about
the amount of pressure that the
housekeeping department gets.
Often the staff is required to do
certain things that mostof us could
not imagine doing. For instance, a

Thoughts

By Nathan Seay

Welcome, ladies and gentle-
men, to the last episode of Seay
Rations this semester. I apologize
for not being present last issue; it
wasn’t my fault. I guess that cen-
sorship article struck a little too
close tohome. Anyway, I’ll get to
the point. I’ve been sitting around
. trying to come up with some super
snappy article to keep you laugh-
ing through the summer, but, alas,
I couldn’t. What I’m gonna talk
about this week is all the things
that have been on my mind this
semester.

I studied in Wales last sum-
mer, which gave me several op-
portunities to become, um, ac-
quainted with sheep. I had never
really seen (or smelled) a sheep up
close and personal before. Any-
one who tells you that sheep are
cute and cuddly creatures obvi-
ously never saw one before. Let
me describe to you how to make a
sheep in your own grocery store.
Get a watermelon for its body.
Jam four carrots in the melon for
its legs. For its head, use a can of
refried beans. Before you attach
the can to the melon, open it up and
smear the beans all over the oppo-
site end. Then you have some idea
of what a real sheep looks like.
Hint: sheep don’t have any toilet
paper.

Some words really bother me.
Take “yogurt,” for example. Who
is the marketing genius who came
up with this name? When some-
body says, “yogurt,” it always
sounds like it should be vomit.
Example: “Ah, man, I think I’m
gonna yogurt.” “Don’t yogurt on
my carpet!” How can the people of
the world continue buying some-
thing with this name? Have you
ever read a yogurt container? It
actually says “contains active yo-
gurt cultures.” What? They’re
telling me that my yogurt is alive?
None for me, thanks. I saw the
movie The Stuff. Ihave a general
Tule that rfo live microbodies enter
my mouth. I'll censor myself here
by not contiuing on this one.

Well, I’ve just about run out
of room. I hope that you enjoyed
this article. Anyway, have a safe
and happy summer. (Private note
to the male freshmen: I promise
you'll hook next year. It won’t
always be as bad as this one).

few weeks ago, several used
condoms were evenly distributed
along the third floor stairwell in
Duke. The individuals responsible
for this act were not held respon-
sible for picking up the condoms-
-the housekeeping staff was.

The fact that the housekeep-
ing department is predominantly
African-American does not mean
that they should have to be looked
down on and treated like trash.
Often people say, “Your first im-
pression is your last.” Well, with-
out the housekeepers, Davidson
would not be able to make a good
first impression. No one wants to
come to a dirty school.

Yes, lunderstand thatsome of
you have maids at home, but thatis
irrelevant. Respect is the relevant
issuehere. The housekeeping staff

is not here to clean your spit off of
the walls, or to pick up your sani-
tary napkins. You owe them the
same respect that you owe your
parents. Since I have witnessed
the tremendous amount of disre-
spect towards the housekeeping
staff, I feel comfortable to assume
that you don’t respect your parents
and more importantly, you don’t
respect yourself. But of course,
there are others to blame for these
problems.

. The reason why the disrespect-
ful attitude towards the housekeep-
ing department continues is the
same reason why many problems
at Davidson continue. That is, the
peoplethat have the authority todo

something just sit on their back- -

sides and do nothing.
When you decide that the best

way to handle one violating the
respect of another is to fine the
perpetrator, who for the most part
is middle to upper-middle class,
you are not doing anything. In
fact, the only thing you may be
doing is perpetuating the notion
that one can do what he/she pleases
and get out of it with the right
amount of money.

Itdiscom forts me toknow that
Davidson considers itself to be a

religious institution, yet acts such —

as the above stated continue. Iam
discouraged, disappointed, and dis-
gusted. Ask yourself, “Would I
appreciate it if my mother had to

am sure that your answer is no.

Malcolm X: His Life after Mecca

By Diedra Montague
and Scott Windham ~

This week, we conclude with
the philosophy of Malcolm X.

In 1965, Malcolm X made the
holy pilgrimage to Mecca, which
is the pinnacle of a Muslim’s reli-
gious experience. This journey,
called Hajj, completely changed
Malcolm’s approach to the Black
nationalist movement.

During his journey, Malcolm
came into contact with Muslims of
many different races, including
white Muslims, who all acted as
brothers and sisters worshipping
the same God and treating each
other as equals. The power and
importance of this period in
Malcolm’s life cannot be over-
stated. He saw that not all white
people were ‘blue-eyed devils,” as
he had stated before, but that many
were capable of brotherly relations
with black people.

Upon his return to the United
States, Malcolm began preaching
his new philosophy. By this time
totally disowned by the Nation of
Islam, Malcolm set up a new orga-
nization of Muslims. In contrast to
his earlier stand that white people
could not be involved in the move-
ment to advance the black race,
Malcolm permitted whites to sup-

port the movement, though they
could not belong to all-black
groups. This was largely because
Malcolm correctly believed that
no white person could truly under-
stand the situation of black people
in America. However, he now
believed that blacks and whites
could successfully work together,
and that many whites were sincere

"Many people are
unfamiliar with his late
Philosophy, and
misrepresent the.
man and his beliefs.”

in wanting to help in the advance-
ment of black people. Instead of a
philosophy of mistrust, hatred, and
separation, Malcolm X preached
racial pride and cautious coopera-
tion.

It is a shame that Malcolm X
was assassinated at a point in his
career when hisnew message could
have reached andhelped thousands
of Americans, black and white.

Now he is remembered mostly for.

his caustic anti-white statements
of hispre-Hajj days, which he even-
tually refuted.

Unfortunately, many people

are unfamiliar with his late phi-
losophy, and misrepresent the man
and his beliefs. Now, at a time
when people state that King’s meth-
ods are outdated and turn instead
to the beliefs of Malcolm X, it is
unfortunate that many of these
same people misunderstand
Malcolm’s true opinions.

This is our final article, our
farewell in a sense. We leave our
column in the capable hands of
Tené Moore and Chris Edmonston,
who will continue where we have
left off. Although some folks may
not have agreed with our opinions,
we hope: that the issues we have
discussed this year will expand
beyond adesk inaroom in Sentelle
to the larger Davidson commu-
nity, and will lead to the kind of
discussion and _ interaction
Malcolm X thought was possible.
We hope that we have inspired
thought and communication. We
sincerely believe that people are
capable of ignoring racial bound-
aries, even if they don’t ignore
race.

Challenge your own preju-
dices and those of people around
you. Remember: we say black
people and white people, but take
away the adjectives and we’re all
just people.

Davidson, and all they ask in re-
turn is some respect and consider-
ation. Nothing gives you the right
to disrespect them. Nothing. I
don’t care how you were raised
and what you have been told, you
are not above them. And you so-
called Christians, of all people,
should know this. At the second
coming, we will not be separated
according to our races, financial
Status, orclass. Instead, we will be
separated according to how well
we performed the Lord’s work.
The housekeeping department has
and continues to také a lot from
Davidson that I suspect most of
you could not handle if placed in
the-same situation. Yet they con-
tinue to love all of you, and they
encourage me.to do the same. Now
that is something worth honoring.
