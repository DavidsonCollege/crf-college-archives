Chris Heineman stretches to add points to Monday’s 81-68
win over Marshall.

Davidson

By KEITH FINCH

The Davidson _ grapplers
fought a tough but rewarding bat-
tle Wednesday night against Fur-
man and Livingstone College, de-
feating Furman 23-21 and holding
out against Division II top 20
Livingstone, losing 41-8.

Things didn’t look too good
for Davidson going into the match
with Furman; the Wildcats had al-
ready lost to Furman once this
year, 30-24, and were without
150-pound junior J.T. Lay — who
broke the top of his ankle and tore
a ligament in Tuesday’s practice.

The action began with a few
Davidson losses; junior Mike
Adams lost some points in the first
period of his 118-pound contest
when he was thrown to his back,
but he survived and spent most of
the match up on his feet, trying to
take his opponent down. He lost
an 8-3 decision. Next, freshman
Rufus Timberlake accepted a for-
feit at 126 pounds, and freshman
Mark Harris was pinned in 1:20.

Things began looking up in
the next match-up; 142-pound
sophomore Bill Breidenstine
opened up by taking his opponent
down, purposely letting him es-
cape, and then taking him down
again to end the first period with a

score of 4-1. He picked up two
points in the second period: one
from his own escape and one from
his opponent’s poor starting posi-
tion, but lost his opponent in the
third period to win 6-2.

Senior Taylor Simpson put
forth a good effort and almost
came through at 150 pounds;
down 4-0 at the end of the second
period, he reversed his opponent
twice in the last minutes of his
contest to score four points. He
nevertheless lost a 6-4 decision.

Next, at 158 pounds,
freshman Sherb Sentell won a
truly exciting match. After fight-
ing for a takedown all through the
first period, he lost some points
during the second period but al-
most pinned his opponent in the
last moments. The third period
saw him lose his opponent by
over-spinning on a spiral break-
down, yet score a takedown and
one point for riding time to win,
11-9.

Sophomore Tim Heinze once
again demonstrated superior con-
trol over his 167-pound opponent;
his ability to score takedowns
proved decisive in his 20-7 deci-
sion. Next, senior Don Stovall ac-
cepted a forfeit at 177 pounds,
while 190-pound senior Gniff

On Monday, the Davidson
Wilcats took a big step forward
and found themselves in the mid-
dle of the race for the Southern
Conference crown when they
thrashed the Thundering Herd
from Marshall 81-68 in front of a
packed and rowdy Johnston gym.
The win left the Cats with a 7-3 re-
cord in the conference, just behind
first place UTC (7-2) and East
Tennessee State (8-3). The loss
moved Marshalll out of first and
gave them a 7-3 conference tally
as well.

The game remained tight
throughout the first eight minutes,
with neither team establishing
much momentum. Davidson crept
ahead by four at 11-7 on a three-
point play by junior Chris Heine-
man, but Marshall came back to
tie the score at 11 and once again
at 13. A resounding dunk by
junior Ace Tanner, and two Tan-
ner free throws after a steal put the
Cats up by four.

Davidson stretched the lead to
seven on three occasions on hot
shooting by sophomore guard
Derek Rucker and solid inside
play from senior Gerry Born, but
the Herd’s Norman Ray, playing
well within the realm of uncon-
sciousness, tossed in 8 of 10 shots
from the field. Ray, shooting 38
percent from the fie|d and averag-
ing 5.5 points before this game,
buried shot after shot with David-
son defenders in his face as he al-
most singlehandedly kept Mar-

shall close. He scored 10 of Mar-
shall’s last 12 points in the first
half to shave the Davidson lead to
38-35 before halftime.

Marshall came out at intermis-
sion playing tough, aggressive de-
fense, and after three quick
Wildcat fouls, Jeff Guthrie
brought the Herd even at 40 witha
breakaway dunk after a steal.
Davidson took a timeout, and
while they rested on their bench,
Marshall was forced to move their
huddle to the court in an effort to
escape the roaring of the crowd.

The lead see-sawed back and
forth until at 52 all, Born hit a
layup and followed with a short
jumper to put the Cats ahead for
good. Marshall twice got as close
as two, but the Cats refused to
miss a shot down the stretch.
Davidson patiently worked the
ball on every possession until they
got a good shot which they inevit-
ably buried.

Marshall took two timeouts
inside two minutes, but the Cats
found all kinds of holes in the
Herd press. Senior Pepper Bego
hit a layup to put Davidson up by
10 and sophomore Jeff Himes
capped off a solid nine point per-
formance with a dunk that brought
the crowd to new heights of frenzy
and put the game out of reach. Just
over a minute later, it was all over
and Davidson walked off the court
with perhaps the most satisfying
victory of this season.

The win broke a streak of eight

straight Marshall wins over
Davidson and moved the Cats to
10-0 record in Johnston Gym this
season. That is the most straight
victories in Johnston Gym since
Davidson's glory days of the late
sixties and early seventies when
the Cats reeled off a phenomenal
59 straight wins. The win put the
Cats at 14-7 on the year, matching
coach Bobby Hussey's highest
win total since coming to David-
son.

Born led the Cats in scoring
with 21 points. Rucker also hit the
magical 20 point plateau. Heine-
man had a very big hand in the win
as he pitched in 13 while smother-
ing Marshall star Skip Henderson
to only eight points (two in the
second half) on four of 15 shoot-
ing. The Cats shot an amazing
86.4 percent from the field in the
second half(missing only three
shots) and 68.9 percent for the
game to counter the Thundering
Herd’s solid 56.1 percent.

It was undoubtably the finest
crowd the Cats have played in
front of this season. The noise was
deafening for all forty minutes of
the game and more as the Wildcat
faithful poured out onto the floor
and chanted “C-A-T-S” for sev-
eral minutes after the conclusion
of the game.

Davidson travels to league
leading UT-Chattanooga on
Thursday. The fate of the South-
erm Conference hangs in the bal-
ance.

taste victory and defeat

Elder fought hard to take his oppo-
ment down with an upper-body
tie-up — but lost by a fall in 3:50.

The fate of the Davidson-Fur-
man match-up was to be decided
by the heavyweight contest,
fought by junior Gary Branch.
With team scores standing at 23
for Davidson and 18 for Furman,
Branch had to avoid losing his
match by more than eleven points.
Although he lost, Davidson won
— his 14-11 decision brought the
score up to 23-21, a Wildcat vic-
tory.

The Davidson wrestlers then
took a break while Livingstone
College and Furman battled it out.
Livingstone stomped Furman, 53-
0.

In the competition against
Livingstone College, Davidson
encountered some more serious
difficulties and some very experi-
enced wrestlers, including at least
one national champion. Yet two
Wildcats managed to win their
matches. Breidenstine won a very
close decision in the last seconds
of his 142-pound contest: with fif-
teen seconds left and the score set
at 3-2, he lifted his cross-body-
riding opponent completely off

score a two-point reversal. His op-
ponent received one point for rid-
ing time, but Bill still won, 5-3.
Tim Heinze also won a close
decision. He scored takedowns
and escapes all through the match,
but had difficulty keeping his op-
ponent on the mat. Or so it seemed
until the third period, when Tim
held his opponent for 1:08 to score

one point for riding time and to
win, 9-4.

Heavyweight Branch scored
two team points for the Wildcats
by tying his opponent 4-4, but all
the other Davidson wrestlers lost
— Adams, Timblerlake, Harris,
Simpson, Sentell and Elder by
pins, and Stovall by a 3-6 deci-
sion. The Wildcats lost 41-8.
