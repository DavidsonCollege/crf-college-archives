The Davidsonian

Rare j

Every Friday and Saturday night,
Bill Hanna leads a little jazz group
down at Cinclair’s Cellar. Bill is
probably in his forties, yet his hair is
stylishly long, he wears one of those
slick print shirts, and between songs
he utters all sorts of ‘‘cool’”’ sayings.

When he plays the piano, he throws
his head back and screws up his face
into agonized expressions as he ‘‘gets
into”’ his music. Too bad he goes into
all these histrionics, because the jazz
he plays is really good; he should let
his music speak for itself.

But maybe I’m coming down too
hard on Bill. His band playssas a very
tight unit; they complement each
other very well. Ronnie Anderson
does a good job on drums, laying
down a good, solid beat, yet not so
loud_or insistent that he stifles his
companions.

Steve Jones plays electric bass, and
although he sometimes gets a little
too assertive for the type of jazz being
played, he has a good sense of rhythm
and can keep up with the fastest of
tempos.

But the man who really makes the
band click is Willie Gillum, an alto
sax player who during the week is an
elementary teacher with the Charlotte
City Schools. In 1964-1965, Gillum
played lead alto in the revamped
“‘Glenn Miller’ band led by Ray
McKinley a drummer of past Swing
Era fame.

And Gillum is excellent. He has the
ability;to play in the lower, more
mellow range of the alto sax, so that it
sounds like a tenor.

He is expressive on slow blues
tunes and ballads, and also shows
good technique and nimble fingers on
fast-tempo tunes.

The first set highlighted Hanna on
piano, and he proved right away that
he can play the blues, as well as do a
passable job on up-tempo Latin
numbers such as One Note Samba.

During the second set, he switched
to trombone on a few tunes, and he
ably demonstrated his mastery ‘over
that instrument as well (Indeed, he
should have played it more during the
evening). Gillum joined in with his
sax, and the result was quite exciting.

For nearly the rest of the evening,

Hanna switched over to electric piano —
and the group moved into some of the ~
more modern, progressive elements of

jazz. They performed George Ben-
son’s Masquerade, with Steve Jones
doing a decent job on the vocals, and
Gillum turning in an excellent sax
solo.

Next was Chick Corea’s Spain,
which demonstrated good, tight uni-
son work between Hanna and Gillum.

But the highlight of the evening }

came with the third set, as Hanna was
persuaded by the audience to return
to the piano, and he and Gillum
performed Queen Bee, a Sammy
Nestico arrangement written for the
Count Basie band. They adapt the
song very well to a small-group
context, and all four performed
admirably.

The last song we heard was a Duke
Ellington standard, Mood Indigo, in
which Gillum was simply fantastic,
managing to give a sensual texture to
this slow-tempo tune.

Between sets I talked to Gillum,
who said they were really goad of the
opportunity to play at Cinclair’s,
which provides the intimate, small-
group-type atmosphere that jazz

buffs love. But I also heard that the

night club, under new management,

wants to turn the place into another

Combine art, violence?

By PATRICK COVINGTON
Staff Writer

Let it not be said that Clint
Eastwood is content to appear on film
as a nameless spaghetti-Western
stranger or a simple-minded detective
named Harry Callahan.

In The Eiger Sanction, this week's
Pop Film, Eastwood plays an art
professor. Who is also a mountain
climber. Who is also a former assassin
for a secret U.S. government agency.
He comes out of retirement from the
last job after a close friend—and
fellow agent —is killed.

Another reason is that he needs
money for his art collection; thus he’s

trying to combine art with violence—
something, presumably, that the film
tries to do as well. His mission takes
him to the Eiger (i.e. a mountain in
Switzerland) where is to sanction (i.e.
kill) the man responsible for his
friend’s death.

As in Play Misty for Me, and The
Outlaw Josey Wales, Eastwood is
director as well as star. The suppor-
ting cast includes George Kennedy,
Vonette McGee, and, reportedly, a
dog named ‘‘Faggot’’; make of the
last what you will. The film is rated
R, and is scheduled for Love Audi-
torium this Friday night.

r found in

one.of those infernal discos, which
would be a damned shame.

There is precious little opportunity
to hear jazz in Charlotte, and even if
Hanna does try to be a little too ‘‘hip”’
at times, the music he and his group
turns out is undeniably good.
