SS
FINANCIAL AGENT FOR
THE COLLEGE ELECTED

In order to facilitate the raising of
the $30,000 balance on the $100,000
Endowment Fund, a financial agent was
recently elected. He is to be perman-
ently employed to attend to the finances
of the institution. Mr. Shive, pastor of
the Presbyterian church at Wilson, N.
C., was called to this work. He has ac-
cepted and is now in the field. His ter-
ritory consists of all the states in which
Davidson College has a sufficient fol-
lowing to warrant him success.

For several days after the opening of
the session, Mr. Shive was at Davidson
getting 2 more intimate knowlefge of the
institution to aid him in his work. There
is a possibility that within the near fu-
ture Mr. Shive will move his family to
Davidson for permanent residence.

All friends of the college will hail
Mr. Shive’s acceptance of the position
‘with pleasure, and Davidson should con-
sider herself fortunate in procuring such
an efficient man for this work.

Dr. C. M. Richards, who received
leave of absence from the local church in
order to conduct this compaign during
the past summer, has resumed his pas-
torate, after a successful canvass.

PLANS FOR THE ANNUAL.

“Quips and Cranks” has everything in
its favor to make the twenty-first volume
of the Davidson Annual the best yet
issued. At present the manager, L. A.
Mullen, is busy selecting and appointing
his staff. Before he appoints this staft
he would like to get in touch with any
one in college who has worked on an
annual in any other school ar has had
experience in this sort of work.

Mr. Monse, of Greensboro, who did
such splendid work last year, will again
have charge of all the photographic
work, except the kodak pictures.

An opportunity will soon be given
every man to give his order for the An-
nual, and the hearty support and co-
operation of the student body in con-
tributing articles, poems and drawings is
all that is necessary to insure the succéss
of this year's Annual and to keep~‘it
among the foremost of the state.

LYCEUM COURSE.

The Y. M. C. A. has made a contract
with the Alkahest Lyceum Bureau for
a course consisting of five numbers. If
the support is such as to justify it, an ex-
tra number will be added.

The Association does not plan {to
make any money, but to provide whole-
some entertainment at a moderate cost.
Season tickets are two dollars each, and
every man who has not bought a ticket
from Manager Witt should see him at
No. 12 Rumople at once.

Everyone who was here year before
last will remember that the lvceum num-
bers furnished by the Alkahest Bureau
were entirely satisfactory. The numbers
which have been secured this year are
first-class in every respect; and it is to
be hoped that the men will give their
hearty support to the management so
that this may be a successful season.

GASTON COUNTY CLUB.

With ten charter members. a Gaston
County Club was organized last Satur-
day night. Mr. F. L. Jackson, a Gas-
ton County man when he graduated
from Davidson, briefly gave his idea of
what should be the purpose of the club,
and presided, until a permanent organi-
zation was effected. Officers as follows
were elected: President. H. W. Or-
mand; vice-president, C. E. Neisler; sec-
retary-treasurer, F, P. Hall; historian,
J. F. Huffstetler. The charter members
are: C. FE. and Paul Neisler, James
Gill. H. W. Ormand. J. F. Huffstetler.
R. H. Ratchford, F. P. and R. D. Hall,
Harvey Davenport and F. L. Jackson.

GOLF CLUB HAS SPLENDID
PLANS FOR THE YEAR

At the first regular meeting of the
golf club, held Tuesday, September 7,
the only official business transacted was
the election of Mr. S. T.. Henderson as
student treasurer of the club to succeed
Mr. Nisbet.

The plans for a fall tournament
among the members of the club was also
brought up and discussed. As a means
of increasing interest among the mem-
bers it was decided to vary the usual or-
der of things. Instead of having the
regular tournament in which each man
plays for himself, it was decided to have
a two ball foursome tournament in which
the players pair off and play in teams of
two men each. Two men are to play
one ball. The players are to qualify as
in an ordinary tournament and the quali-
fying rounds are to be played during the
month of September. The date of the
tournament has not been definitely de-
cided.

The purpose of such a tournament
will be to increase among the players
team spirit. It is hoped that some time
in the near future Davidson will send
out a golf team to represent her in that
field of sport. A more immediate hope.
however, is to have a match between
plavers selected from our club and a cor-
responding number from Charlotte
This match will come off immediately
after the fall tournament.

Tt was decided furthermore to keep
the club dues for students at $5.00. per
annum, the fiscal year beginning Septem-
ber 2.
