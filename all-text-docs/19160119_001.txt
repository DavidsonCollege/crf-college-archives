The DAVIDSONIAN

Vol. II.

Two Lectures Given
During the Past Week

On Interesting War Experiences
and on Explosives.

Mr. Alexander B. C. Weel made :
most interesting and instructive address
in the auditorium last Thursday even-
ing to an audience which filled the hall.

Dr. Martin introduced Mr. Weel

witha few happy remarks, stating that.

he was a fellow-Southerner, born in
Louisiana and a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Alabama.

Mr. Weel took up the first few min-
utes explaining the details of the High-
lander garb which he wore. He then
told of his experiences from the begin:
ning of the war. Feeling the injustice
done to Belgium, he sailed to England
September, -1914.. to join the forces.
After being more than once arrested as a
German spv in England, he at last man-
aged to join the famous Canadian Black

Watch. He got the habit of volunteer-!

ing for everything. as he put it, so soon
became a scout. After many thrilling
escapes and two battles. he was wounded
at Ypres.

After spending three months in the
hospital he returned to America on the
ill-fated R. M.S. “Hesperian.” He has
been awarded, on account of his work,
the title of “captain.” He will return
to his post soon.

Mr. Weel’s talk was full of little de-
tails that made it interesting and in-
structive. Many humorous touches
brought laughter from the house. His
descriptions of the trenches, scouting sys-
tem, German efficiency and poison ga:
attack especially were good. For almost
two hours he held the attention of the
audience closely.

LECTURE ON. EXPLOSIVES,

Col. S. T. Taylor, of the Bureau of
Explosives of the United States and
Canada, delivered his widely-given lec-
ture on “High Explosives” in Shearer
Hall Friday night. The lecture, accom-
panied throughout with — stereuptican
views, was both interesting and instruct-
ive.

Colonel Taylor went considerably in-
to detail to show how at present the rail-
way companies of America are taking
every precaution to lessen the danger of
shipping high explosives by rail. Tllus-
trations of the precautionary labels used
on the various kinds of explosives were
shown.

This lecture was given under the aus-
nices of the Chemical Club. and was the
first of a series they hope to secure from
time to time.

Y. M. C. A. ELECTS OFFICERS.

The meeting of the Y. M. C. A. last
Thursday evening was for the purpose
of electing officers for the association for
the next collegiate vear. A committee
appointed bv the president presented a
list of names of men who would make
efficient executives. From this selec-
tion were elected: President. T. J.
Mitchell; Vice-President, P. B. Price:
Secretary. E. P. Childs; Treasurer, J.
R. Woods. The cabinet has not yet
been anpointed. The officers-elect enter
upon their official duties about April 1.
The prospects are bright for the new ad-
ministration.

SPRING DEBATES.

Contracts have been signed with
Emory College for a debate to be held
at Agnes Scott College, April 24. The
subject that has been agreed upon is:
“Resolved, That the British Govern-
ment is more democratic than that of
the United States.” This will be the
second year Davidson has _ debated
Emory in Atlanta, and the fight this
year will doubtless be harder than that
of last season. Davidson came out with
the laurels at that time, and = so the
Emory students will be out for revenge.

Davidson will also debate Erskine
College next Spring, the exact date and
subject to be announced later.

The first preliminaries for these de-
hates will be held in the respective so-
cieties, January 25, at which time the
Emory subject will be used. The second
preliminary will be held in Shearer Hall
Februarv 12, at which time the two
teams will be chosen. The subiect used
in the second preliminaries will he the
one chosen for the Erskine debate.

Among the alumni who visited the
Hill during the Christmas holidavs were
D. M. McGeachv (ex-'17). now at
Union Seminary in Richmond. and S.
H. Cook (’o9). now a member of the
oany of the Berry School, at Rome.

hard-earned.

hard ball playing in the laste few minutes
of play, were able to roll up their score
