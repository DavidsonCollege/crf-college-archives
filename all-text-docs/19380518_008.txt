... LIVINE MORE PLEASURE
to a whole world of smokers _ -

... the international code
for MORE SMOKING

PLEASURE

Smokers the world over
know that They Satisfy is the signal
for more smoking pleasure.

Ghestenficlds are made
of mild ripe tobaccos — home-grown
and aromatic) Turkish—and pure ciga-
rette paper ...the best ingredients a
cigarétte can have.

With Chesterfields you are always
sure of refreshing: mildness, more
pleasing aroma and better taste.
