Registrar Announces Changes to Time/Space Continuum

By Irwin Lipschitz

The Registrar has announced
the new expanded schedule for
Davidson for the years 92 - ’93.
Under the new system, the
Davidson school year will be
lengthened to 16 week semesters,

the longest in the nation.
The longer semesters, however,
willnot have an effecton the actual

duration of the school year - the
extra time will be taken out of
vacations.

The move is the first in
Davidson’s New “Quantity over
Quality” Campaign set to begin
during the ’92 - °93, year. This
exciting new program portcnds
many exciting changes to the
Davidson expericnce.

After the installment of 16 week
semesters, the Registrar an-
nounced, students will be required
to take night classes, which will be
offered from 7-12 each night.

When asked if the new require-
ment seemed extreme, Sue Ross
remarked, “Oh, don’t be silly.
There’s nothing students would
enjoy more after a nice hot meal

It Will Be Done: 2025

By Izzy Sheareeus

This just released to
Davidphonian staff: Quips and
Cranks for 1989-1990 will be re-
leased in 2025!!!

This is good news, but it pres-
ents a problem for students who
aren’t sure where thcy’ll be by
then.

Junior Jennifer Gibbs has only
planned her life through the year
2011 at this point, and thinks that
by 2025 she’ ll definitely be over-
seas. “Why should I fly back from

Africa’, she asks, “just to pick up

some annual?”

Why, indeed? Because this
annual will be the ycarboook to
endall yearbooks. Imagine - gradu-
ation pictures from the classes of
‘91 and ‘92, plus exclusive previ-
ously unprinted excerpts from Kitty
Kelley’s upcoming novels, The Life
and Times of Dean Terry and The
Unauthorized Biography of Presi-
dent Jobe. |

“Buthow will we remember to

Great New Class! |

come pick itup?”, asks senior Holt .
Foster. “I mean, I'll be 55!!”

Notto worry, Holt-- O&C will
be sending you an announcement
that April. It'll go something like
this:

“Remember 1990? When you
were still in shape, when you still

_had hair? Take yourself back to

the days of Hurricane Hugo, when
Saddam Hussein was still receiv-
ing CIA funds and Bush was still
wallowing in wimpdom ... Leave
the grandchildren at Day Care!
Exercise your blue chip stock op-
tions! Drive, fly, hobble on down
to Davidson College (Remember
us? We’re the ones who still ask
for money every November) to
pick up the new, improved,
expanded Quips and Cranks,
1989-90. (Note to juniors, sopho-
mores, and freshmen of 1989-90:
Don’t worry if 2025 is not your
class’s year forareunion; we’ ll put
you in the Martin Guest House
Complex.)

William F, Buckley, Jr. has
vowed a #1 ranking for Davidson
innext year’s College Wholesome-
ness issue of The National Review.
Vice-President of Academic Af-
fairs Robert Williams could be
heard giggling withdelightatnews
of the announcement. _

Some of the available courses
include Girlies and Busch Beer:

Courtney Nichols and Bess
Murchison, chairmen of the Com-
mittee for Girls’ Stuff, see this
program as a window of opportu-
nity, from which Davidson stu-
dents will learn the holiness of our
educational past. “We think it’s,
like, rilly cool!” they bubbicd.

wondered if the color clashed with
the red and black bricks. “Maybe
they could put up a green one next
time” was her suggestion. A base-
ball player approached (carefully)
by a Davidphonian staff member
did not like it, saying “bows is for
queers.” A noted Davidson femi-
nist liked the new bow, though her
reasons were different. “To me, it
represents the bondage in which
all men hold all womeff. We’rc
working onsome sortof anti-male
demonstration to beheld some time
next week underncath this symbol
we must tcach all people to de-
spise.”

In separate but related inci-
dents, five of the Patterson Court
houses have begun displaying bows
as well. A KA spokesgentleman
offered a different slant on the is-

than 2 or 3 hours of Bio lab.”
Soon, the College plans to
lengthen school days. For the
Spring ’93 semester, days will be
expanded from 24 to 30 hours.
Minutes will be expanded to 100
seconds as well.
Whenasked if altcring the space/
time continuum to suit Davidson’s
new scheduling requirements

didn’t seem a bit extreme, a scnior
administrator remarked, “Oh, no.
We think the changes will be best
for the students. The college wants
to bring the students the most for
their cducation dollar. More is
always better.”

Senior Mark Puckettcommented,
“Thank God I got out of this place
before everything went loony.”

We're Going Back!

By Sneaky Trusty

At an alcohol soaked reception
last weck, an inner group of van-
guard trusteccs overwhelmingly
voted to rejoin the Southern Con-
ference Thursday. They cited as
their reason a necd to get back to
Davidson’s glory ycars of 63 &
*64 when Davidson really mat-
tered.

When students approached the
trustees about the move at the re-
ception on Thursday the grand old
patriarchsdrunkcnly slurred, “Hah!
Why don’t you tell the SGA to

“draft a resolution, and we’ll get

right on it.”

Addressing faculty concerns
about the return one trustee re-
marked, “They don’t really have
all the facts. Professors have al-
ways been way off in La-La land.
Especially the one that failed mein
Bible 101 way back in ’38.”

“We necd to get back to the days
when wewerce kicking the crap out
of Duke and North Carolina. I think
wecould even makcarunat UNLV
if we could get Craig, Larry, Stu
and Danicl to throw some morc
moncy Terry’s way,” the imprcs-
sionable man blurted.

Apparcnily they have been con-
sidering dropping the academic
part of the Davidson curriculum
for some while now. It should be
a relatively short time before the
out-of-touch professors are given
their long-overduc walking papers.

The SGA has planned a meeting
that, in the words of President
Cammie Covington, “calls for
immediate discussion. We don’t
know if we can go so far as a
resolution; that hasn’t been donc
in a few years, but we sure can
discuss it.”

sue. “There have beena lot of egg-
throwing wars lately, mainly us,
PiKA and SAE. This ribbon is a

symbol of our support for the guys.

who have been hit, and it won’t
come down until all of us have
gotten ourcgg-staincd clothes back
from the laundry.” PiKA had-a
similar explanation. One long-
haircd dude o’ the house said,
“well, normally we’rc too laid back
to make any statements, but if this
means we support dicking the
Hods, we’re all for it.” SAE put up
their ribbon in an clfort to improve
relations with the rest of the cam-
pus. “We figure that ifthe admini-
stration up the hill secs that we’ re
taking the right stand on this sol-
dicr issuc, they might like us bet-
ter.”

SPE placcd their bow on their
irce, right under that chair. “We're
not going to be upstaged by any-
one,” was their explanation, “the

other houses threw eggs, we threw
eggs. The other houscs putup bows,
so we will. It’s that simple.” Rusk
was the last house on the court to
display a bow. Onc Ruskic on her
way tocattold The Davidphonian,
“well, SAE and KA did it, so it
must be cool.”
Whilc unwilling to comment
on the library’s new bow, Dean
Terry did praisc the Pattcrson Court
changes, “if they are watching the
newsand wantto makcastatcment
about it, morc power to them,”
This comment proved foreboding
by weck’s end, though, when Bob
Collins revealed his opinion on the
subject. “This ismy campus, I don’t
like ribbons or the color ycllow,

row, you might be
dead!

Osmond as the Chairman of the
Music Department. _

New York businessman John
Gotti will be taking over the col-
lege’s finances. “Revenues from
Gotti’s undisclosed investments are
expected to triple within the next
fifteen minutes,” said Ivan Boesky,
Chairman of the Economics De-
partment.

Although currently awaiting
trial for various tawdry activities
during his tenure as President of
USC, Holderman is convinced he
will be able to serve as Davidson’s
President without difficulty.

“I’m gonna beat this rap. It’s
justa bunch of pointy headed intel-
Icctual wussics trying to get back

at me for being a good administra-
tor. Those liberal arts punks think
they can bag me, HA! Davidson’s
made a good choice in canning
those geeks they call teachers.
Under my leadership, we’re gonna
redefine education,” claimed Hold-
erman.

Not everyone. was _ pleased
about the trustee decision. A
movement among the former fac-
ulty to convince the trustees to re-
verse their decision, led by former
professor Gill Holland, was swiftly
crushed by former L.A. Police
Chief, Darry! Gates, Davidson’s
new Director of Public Safcty.
Holland’s battercdbody has served
as a warning among the former
faculty not to challenge the trustee
measure, ray

“D is for Dollars, and dollars

are for Davidson” exclaimed one
trustee, “anybody who has a prob-
lem with that is the-kind of pinko-
commie yankee who supports
things like Division III athletics.
People like thatneed to be shot, or,
at the very least, be kept the hell off
the tennis courts, that’s for damn
sure,” said the trustee, who de-
manded that we not reveal his
name.

Three members of Davidson’s
staff will be kept on, however.
Athletic Director Terry Holland
and Psychology professor Julio
Ramirez have been deemed famous
cnough toremain, while Dean Wil-
liams shall keep his job, as his
emphasis on publication has been
found admirable. Holland and
Ramirez could not be reached for
comment.
