New coach Kresse discusses

(David McCurry)

planned athletic philosophy

By CATHEY BOST
Staff Writer

John Kresse is in a ‘‘frighten-
ing’’ situation: He is David-
son’s ninth head hasketball
coach in just over twelve years.

The College hired Kresse last
week to replace former head
coach Eddie Biedenbach. Kres-
se was head basketball coach for
two years at the College of
Charleston, where he led teams
to two straight NAIA district 6
playoffs.

Athletic Director Gene Bing-
ham said Kresse is as ‘‘good as
custom-ordered’”’ for the job.
Bingham said he was looking
for “‘a man who would impart
and demonstrate discipline and
who had certain values comfort-
able with Davidson’s academic
standards.”

Kresse said his philosophy is

‘students first, athletes sec-
. ond.”’ He sai
create a feeling
the staff, my players, and the
student body. I will extend
myself fully to any student...
I’m very excited about this
opportunity.”

was a three-year contract. Bing-
ham said the increase indicates
the Board of Trustees’ commit-
ment to building a competitive
Southern Conference team.
‘‘We’ve had enough of that
in-and-out stuff with our coach-
es,”’ Bingham said.

Both Kresse and Bingham
declined to comment on the
rumor that Kresse’s salary is
less than Biedenbach’s.

Kresse said he is looking
forward to the Wildcats’ next
season and is enthusiastic about
his new team. He foresees
‘strenuous practices,” ‘‘on-the-
court discipline,’’ ‘‘competitive
basketball,’’ and a ‘‘showcase
team that hustles.’’ He wants to
see the Wildcats develop ‘‘a
competitive but unselfish team
style on offense and defense.’’

However, he cautioned that

tice basis. I’ve always been a

He ‘never saw the gun’

By JEFF MANN
Managing Editor

Sophomore Joe Leman was
shot in the chest last Thursday
at Hattie’s Night, the annual
beer bash at Fannie and Ma-
bel’s eating house (F&M). Sus-
pect Robert Shackleford, a con-
struction worker at the Dining
Commons, turned himself in the
next morning. He has been
charged with assault with a
deadly weapon with intent to
kill.

Leman was shot at point
blank range with a .38 caliber
handgun. The slug punctured
his right lung without exiting.
He is in satisfactory condition
at Charlotte Memorial Hospit-
al, and should return to school
in time to finish the spring
term. Leman said that doctors
told him he ‘‘would have been
killed if the shot had been
three-quarters of an inch over.”’

Eighteen-year-old Shackle-

ford was released Friday on a
System arrives June 15

pre-trial release program. No
bond was posted for his release,
according to Davidson College
Security Chief Jackie Hughes.

According to Hughes and
several eyewitnesses, the shoot-
ing occurred shortly after 12:30
a.m. when four construction
workers started throwing beer
on students. Leman was follow-
ing one of the four outside when
another of the men called out,
“Don’t worry, I’m here,’’ ac-
cording to sophomore Kevin
Attar, an eyewitness. Leman
began walking towards the
second man, saying that he had
no argument with him, and the
man pulled a handgun from his
belt and fired at point blank
range, Attar said.

“TI never even saw the gun...
just a flash and a bang,’’ Leman
recalled in the hospital.

The assailant ran from the
scene, and the other three men
left in a blue Sunbird.

Police have not recovered the

weapon, but they have recover-
ed the slug, confirming that it
was a .38 caliber pistol.

Police stopped the Sunbird in
Huntersville shortly after the
incident. The three occupants
were questioned and released,
Hughes said.

A friend of Shackleford’ 8
called Hughes at 5:00 a.m. on
Friday to tell him that Shackle-
ford wanted to turn himself in.

The Council on Campus and
Religious Life(CCRL) met on
Wednesday to discuss ways to
prevent similar events from
occurring in the future. Several
CCRL members will present
their suggestions to the officers
of F&M on Friday, Dean of
Students Will Terry said, ‘“The
shooting made us realize that
changes need to be made.”’ He
said that this is the first time
that something like this has
happened at the College.

Terry said he did not know if

Davidson will acquire $500,000 computer

By AGNES STEVENS
Staff Correspondent

The College’s new computer should be ready for
installation by June 15, according to Computer
Services Director Robert DeSieno.

The Board of Trustees approved DeSieno’s
choice for the new system on February 27.

DeSieno selected two computer units manufac-
tured by Prime Computers, Incorporated, the
Prime 750 and the Prime 550.

The estimated cost of the computers them-
selves is $500,000, DeSieno said. DeSieno ‘‘can’t
say for sure’’ what the complete system will cost
the College. |

College President Samuel Spencer said on
Tuesday that ‘‘about $100 of this year’s tuition
increase was due to the new computer system.”
Associate Dean of the Faculty Nick Burnett said,
‘Any effect on tuitien will be from the operating
budget, not the purchase.”

Last year the College applied for a $250,000
grant from the National Science Foundation
(NSF). This grant is ‘‘still pending,’’ DeSieno
said, until May. However, he added, President
Reagan’s proposed cuts in the Foundation’s
budget ‘‘substantjally diminish’’ Davidson’s

This spring, PIKA President Terry
Wade will submit a proposal to the
Patterson Court Council (PCC) to re-
place the self-selection process with a
two-tier system.

The proposal is backed by the officers
of the Patterson Court fraternities. The
fraternities are dissatisfied because they
think the present system is misleading.

The Trustees would have to approve
any change in the system.

Wade’s proposal would allow frater-
nities and other interested eating houses
to return to a bid system while retaining
the self-selection process for the rest. of

Theoretically under the present sys-
tem, ‘‘any student who has shown real
interest. . .will not be denied admission
to the house or fraternity of his choice,”’
according to Dean of Students Will
Terry.

However, Self-selction co-coordinator
Betsy Thomas feels that self-selection at
present ‘is not fulfilling its said pur-
pose.’

Although she believes in the idea
behind self-selection, Thomas believes

chances of receiving the grant.

The College is prepared to cover the full cost of
the computer purchase, DeSieno said. Even if the
NSF grant were awarded, over 60% of it would be
used for orientation and training rather than for
the purchase of hardware.

The Prime 750 will be ‘‘dedicated to faculty and
student,yse’’ during the day, DeSieno said. The
Prime 580, reserved for administrative use during
office hours, will also be available to students and
professors in the evening.

Initially there will be 30 terminals, according to
DeSieno. The terminals will probably be located
in Chambers and the library. Ultimately, the
system has a capacity for 150 to 175 terminals.

The College now has a seven-year old computer
system composed of a National Cash Register -
(NCR) and a smaller DEC 8DP-8f.

The Board of Trustees voted last September to
replace the old system, and asked DeSieno to
choose it. DeSieno had already been hired last
spring at the recommendation of the Computer
Planning Committee.

The faculty also gave DeSieno a vote of
confidence October 7.
