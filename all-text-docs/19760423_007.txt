Bridge tournament trumps success

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor

Davidson bridge players
have completed eight of nine
sessions of the American con-
tract Bridge League Scholar-
ship tournament with George
Flavell holding a slim three
point lead over Alan Rockett.

All players are dealt from 18
to 24 identical hands and all
scoring is based on a 0-4 point
system for each hand. Each
participant is allowed to take
his six best scores but is
allowed no more than four
scores with the same partner.

Tournament play is held
every other Sunday night’ and
after the first eight sessions
Flavell has scored 376.8 points
or 62.8 percent of the Maxi-
mum number of points a play
can accumulate.

Rockett has 373.8 points or
a 62.3 percentage and could
easily overtake Flavell in the

final session on May 2. Mike
Russ, who has been instru-
mental in the tournament’s
conception, is in third place
with 363.6 points but will be
unable to catch Flavell who
will be his partner in the final
session.

According to Russ, a score
of 50 percent is average and a
percentage of 60 or above is
very good. A score of 50
percent is equivalent to
scoring two points on each
hand dealt during the session.

Approximately 20 people
have been competing in the
event that started during the
winter term. However, Russ is
somewhat disappointed that
the tournament did not receive
greater student support.

“Down at the frats there is a
lot of bridge playing before
and after meals and I figure
there’s at. least 50-100 people
who could have played,’’ he
explained.

There i is a special ’ interest in

the Davidson tournament
because it is the first of its

‘ kind in the country. Russ

expects that when the tour-
nament is completed there will

. be a flood of media analyzing

the success of the scholarship
competition.

“Higher up bridge people
and publications will be inter-
ested in our results since it
was the first and only one,”’
Russ noted.

more tournaments will depend
a great deal on how well our

tournament was run.”

In April, 1976 when the. bicenten-
nial spirit has begun to fade, Ah
Wilderness! was a refreshing excep-
tion. With a genuine but not over-
bearing American flavor, the pro-
duction was fresh and new on its
opening night and the audience
responded to it with enthusiasm.

The play is unusual in its own
right, as Eugene O’Neill’s only
comedy. But it was the personal
touches, not merely the lines, that
lended the play its spirit and in their
convincing setting brought New
England, 1906, to life.

The play, directed by Professor of
‘Drama Rupert T. Barber, revolves
around the Miller familyand concen-
trates on-the rebellious teenage
Richard who spouts poetic phrases,
but learns their meaning only with
experience. Brad Christie enlivened
this role with his repertoire of facial
expressions.

As mother and father, Emily Pate
and Scott Reid were ihe other major
supporting actors, consistently in
character as well as in good form.
Graham Smith, Steve Kruger and the
house photographer are credited with
delightful comic scenes.

The set was designed by Professor
of Drama Joseph Gardner, and was
most impressive. The huge Victorian
house not only fit the family that
inhabited it, but made the Hodson

Hall stage look comfortable and huge,
a major accomplishment in itself. The
home was colorful and complete,
presenting the illusion of its entirety
in only two rooms. The constumes
blended well to round out the pic-
turesque settling.

The weakness of Wednesday night
lay more in the script than in the
performance itself. Even the brief
beach and barroom respites could not
compensate for the fact 80 percent of
the play takes place within the
confines of the house. This causes an
otherwise entertaining performance to
drag in parts.

All in all, Ah, Wilderness! was an
evening well spent. An enthusiastic
student audience responded to an
enthusiastic perfomance that should
only improve with time.

Ah, Wilderness! also features the
following students: Steven Cline,
Lyman Collins, Gail Maynard, Mar-
garet Noel, Susan Baynard, Craig
Lovin, Fran Worthy, Mary Hay,
Robert Nicholson, and Mark Tyndall.

The play will continue through
Saturday, April 24th, with shows
each night at 8:00. Tickets may be
purchased at the box office in
Cunningham Fine Arts Center on
Friday from 2:00-5:00 and 7:00-8:15
and on Saturday form 9:00-12:00.
Prices are $1.50 for Davidson stu-
dents, and $2.50 for General Admis-
