Question

at the Week

In view of the question of poli-

tics and their virtues and faults
the question of voting has arisen.
To obtain a cross-section of stu-

dent opinion on the systems of yot-
ing the following question was put
to several nen: What plan of vot-
ing would you suggest to replace
the present system.of placing bal-
lots in the back of seats in chapel

or do you think the present sys-
tem is satisfactory?

Jim Crutchfield, Senior:

The present system gives results
that are remarkably good, but it
seems to me that a. better system

would be to place a recepticle by
Gich door trom which the ones who
wished to vote could take the slips
of paper as they entered. After the
choice of Candidates has-been made;
the

voters could drop their votes

in ballot boxes placed by the doors
containers from

system would elimin-

careless or lackadasical voters

who do more harm than good by

voting for the well known char-
acters, Joe Blow and Horace Lutz,

and might, the student. willing, pre-

vent so much distraction in the

form of ballot airplanes being sail-

ed hither and yon over the heads

of the would-be voters.
Dan Hodges, Sophomore:

The present system of voting

hasn't been what we've needed
in order to assure everybody’s
getting a chance to vote whether
he is in chapel or not the day the
slips are placed in the seats. To
remedy this a locked box should
be placed outside each chapel
door on each election day and left
there all day with ballots beside
it. In that way a boy could vote
anytime during the day—signing
his ballot, of course—and it would
do away with having the ballots
filled out in chapel and possibly
getting lost, and would give cha-
pel absentees a chance to vote
anyway. Then, in the evening the
ballots should be collected and
counted at one time.

John W. Moore, Junior:

There are some evils in the pres-
ent system of voting that might be
corrected, The malpractice of ab-
sentee, duplicate, and neglected bal-
lots might be eliminated by a check
list and a locked ballot box system.
There should be ‘a student council
member .and man
present at the counting of the votes.
Albert Green, Junior:

I favor retaining the present
system. Undeniably illegal voting
has occurred in past years but I
think we should try to educate
ourselves to honesty, rather than
create new rules and forms de-
signed to frustrate unfair voting.
The temptation is not an over-
whelming one, and I believe that
a word or two by our president
on that subject should suffice. Is
the Davidson Gentleman really
without honor?

John Milnes, Senior:

To have an honest and accurate
election we must follow the™ sys-
tems used in municipal and state

a non-fraternity

elections. That is, we should have
‘a list of the student body at a
specified place. A student council
man will be there and when a

student wishes to vote he will be
given a ballot and his name will
be checked off the list. This would
assure and only one vote
to every qualified person. A locked
ballot box should be placed in a
convenient place and at the end
of a day’s voting the ballots should
-be counted.

‘Paul Crane, Junior:

The present system of placing
votes in chapel seats seems ade-
quate, but an improvement might
be found in having ballot boxes
at the chapel doors in which to
place votes on leaving chapel.
This would save the collectors of
the votes time and energy. and
insure each man’s placing only
one vote if the boxes were watch-
ed by a collector.

Bob Carter, Sophomore:

It seems to me that the present
system of counting and collecting
votes is rather careless and in-
efficient. Many elections are decid-
ed by a. few votes, and the very
votes that would decide the issue

are somewhere on the floor ‘of the
auditorium. A ballot box in the
back of chapel with a check-up
list would eliminate all the trou-
ble, although it would take up, a
little-time,
