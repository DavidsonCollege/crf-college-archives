Social life adjusts to new. regulations

_. By ANDY BARRON

In response to North Carolina
raising the legal drinking age to
21, Davidson's new social poli-
cies concerning freshmen and _al-
cohol on Patterson Court took ef-
fect last week. And while no seri-
ous problems with either regula-
tion occurred, students, faculty
and administrators continue to
take a “wait and see” stance on the
new policies.

Both the restriction from Pat-
terson Court for freshman and the
new alcohol policy were de-
veloped by committees and ap-
proved by the Council of Campus
and Religious Life last spring.
The Patterson Court Selection
Study Committee submitted a pro-
posal, ammended by the CCRL,

‘ that included, two major restric-
tions concerning freshman on Pat-
‘terson Court:

1) That freshmen will not be
allowed to attend Court functions.
on or off campus for the first five
weeks of fall terms.

2) During the second five
weeks of fall term, freshmen will
‘be allowed to participate ‘in ser-

vice projects sponsored by the
houses, selected meals and
weekend functions.

The new alcohol policy con-
ceming Patterson Court, submit-
ted by the Patterson Court Council

and approyed by the CCRL, re-‘

quires houses to serve’ alcohol
downstairs to those ‘having re-
ceived a stamp after showing
proper identification at the‘top of
the stairs.

Senior Dan Murrey, who
chaired the selection committee,
said his committee originally rec-
ommended a seven-week restric-
tion from Patterson Court for
freshman. He said his committee
felt homecoming was for alumni

‘and not an appropriate time for.

“the first big rush of freshmen.”

Senior and SGA President
Mark Sandy, a member of CCRL,
said he felt the CCRL thought
seven weeks was being too “pater-
nalistic” and decreased the Court
restriction to five weeks.

The goals of the freshmen
Court restrictions include unity in
the~freshmen class and giving
freshrnen a chance to get settled

before facing the pressures of
selecting. .

“First of all it will slow the
tempo down in the freshmen life,”
Dean of Students Will Terry said.
“It will give freshmen a chance to

get together with members of their °

class, have some study time, do,
campus activities and get accli-
mated before feeling pressure.”

Terry also hoped that
freshman would get involved in
service activities so that “‘associa-
tion with a house isn't entirely
based on parties.”

Concerning the new Court al-
cohol policy Terry said he felt the
new procedures were working
well and praised the PCC for_the
way it dealt with the new drinking
law.

Senior Mike Holt, president of .

KA, said he felt the alcohol policy
was working.

“As I see it, the alcohol policy
is designed to protect the liable in-
dividuals in a house,” Holt said.
“The goal of the policy — to
keep people under 21 from enter-
ing the drinking area — seems to
be working.”

Holt added that people under

‘21 were still getting plenty to

drink through individuals taking it
on themselves to provide unde-
rage drinkers with alcohol.

Sandy said student involve-

ment in both new policies was im-
portant.
“One of the best things about

the Patterson Court Selection
Committee was that the commit-
tees making the proposals and
granting approval all had a major-
ity of students,” he said.

The new social regulations
have increased the Union’s in-

volvement in Davidson’s social:

calendar, especially for freshmen.

“We've been trying to con-
vince everybody that the drinking
issue isn’t that big a deal,” senior
Lucinda Kellam, union board
president, said. “We've talk
hall counselors, freshmen, frater-
nities and eating houses and said
that just because the drinking age
went up, social activities on cam-
pus aren’t dying. We've been try-
ing to program events that don’t
need alcoho! where freshmen and

Vice president Williams begins new job

By ANDREA DIEDRICH

Robert C. Williams, new dean
of the. faculty and vice president
for academic affkirs, said he ac-

cepted the position in part because.

he was “struck by the sense of

mission, sense of purpose, and

sense of commitment toward edu-
cation” found here.

With a BA from Wesleyan
University, and experience as a
professor at Williams College, he

is committed to the liberal arts.

“Education for leadership strikes -

me as what Davidson is about
rather than training for specialized
careers,” Williams said.

About his move to Davidson
he said, “It was a reaffirmation of
my faith in the liberal arts.”

As chairman of the Education

‘Policy Committee, . Williams
hopes to examine the entire. cur-
riculum to evaluate what David-
son should require in order to fully
educate its students. Williams
said he recognizes the importance

of area requirements but sees the '

need for greater latitude in fulfil-

ling them because of the overlap-

ping of disciplines. He plans to

encourage More student indepen-
dence and research. +

He hopes to strengthen the
laboratory sciences, the develop-
‘ment of quantitativé reasoning,
and foreign language study. He
sees “technological literacy” as a
possible requirement for gradua-
tion but not necessarily computer
literacy. Although he believes in
supporting the students in learning
to use computers, he said, “I don’t
believe computing is essential to a
liberal: arts education as mnathema-
tics is.’ .

Williams also plans to
examine the possibility of chang-
ing. the calendar system to a
semester or 4: 1:4 system. He said,
“The way we should structure
education is with the knowledge
that people learn and people teach
best at different rates in different

fields of study. There is no natural’

reason for classes that meet every
day.”
As dean of the faculty, Wil-

liams is the chief representative of
the faculty to the administration
and as vice president for academic
affairs he is chief representative of
the administration to the faculty.
He believes the most important
duty required by the office is to
“recruit, evaluate, and promote
the best faculty we can find. Un-
less Davidson has first rate facul-
ty, it can’t be a first rate college.”
Williams’ other responsibili-

ties include advising the president |

on matters of tenure and promo-

_tion, chairing the Faculty Study

and Research Grants Committee,
and attending meetings of the
Board of Trustees.

Williams received his AM in
Russian Studies and PhD. in His-
tory from Harvard University.
Just prior to coming to Davidson
he was Professor of History ‘and
Dean of University College at
Washington ‘University in St.
Louis. Williams is not currently
teaching, but he hopes.to teach a
seminar on the Manhattan Project

and courses in Russian history. He
is married to Ann B. Kingman
who spent 11 years performing

Main St.

upperclassmen can get together.”
Union Director William

Brown feels the Union's responsi- -

bility is changing.
“Over the: last several yea
we’ve seen ourselves as partners

with the Court in providing social —

options,” he said. “We've never

misled ourselvés to think we are |
both the PCC alcohol policy and—the-only social outlet. However

with freshmen, if we aren't pro-
viding things to.do, no one is.”

And what do the freshmen
think?

Most aren’t worried about Pat-

terson Court being off limits sim-
ply because they don’t know what
Davidson is like with Court par-
ties.

“I don’t think it’s that big a
deal,” ‘freshman Leigh Hall said.
“I think of jt (the Court) as some-

Oo .thing for us to look forward to

doing. It’s sot really « deprivation ~

since we don’t know what we’re
missing.”
Freshman Lisa Branch said, “I

haven’t had a lack of things to do. |

Why worry about things that you
can’t do?”

Minnich speaks on feminism in today’s world

By DAVID WILLIAMS

“The relationship of females
to schooling is one that is having
very serious consequences,” Dr.
Elizabeth Minnich told about 50
Davidson students Monday in .a
forum sponsored by the Women’s
Concerns Committee. -

Minnich, a graduate professor
specializing in feminist scholar-
ship, said: “Women are brought
up to take too much credit and also

to take too much blame” for their’

successes and failures. She said
that a woman who takes credit for
“getting; the opportunity to move
fi into a high-level job may really be
there “because the women’s

‘movement pushed it. And if the
women’s movement goes away,
we'll lose it.”

At the same time, Minnich
said, “if a woman doesn’t under-
stand sexism and.racism, then she
will take too much blame” for her
failures. “If you don’t know about
the structures that have impact on
your ‘career,” she said, “and
you're not promoted or paid more
when others are, you’re liable to
say it’s your fault, when it really
isn’t.”

mans and non-humans. The norm
remains white, European male.”
She said, “If you show people a
picture of a room filled with
people doing various things, and
if you look and it’s filled with
white men, it’s people If the
‘room is filled with white women,
it’s women, and with black men
and women, it’s black people.?

Minnich emphasized the im-
portance of women’s studies in
the classroom. “Unless your
classes regard feminist scholar-

Minnich’ noted ‘that human--~ship, they are ‘utterly inadequate

kind ‘tends to be divided “into

. fragmented little groups as. hu-

and outdated,” she said. She
added: “People will almost always

come away from their first immer- -

sion in women’s studies and say,

‘Why talk about women?’ Yet
they never say, ‘Why talk about
men?’ We must become aware
that we have developed women’s
studies over the past 15-20 years,
against milleniums” of human
studies that focus mainly on men.
“That’s hardly overdoing ‘it,” she
said. “We can’t talk about humans

unless we talk about the ‘other’ 51.

percent of humankind.”

Minnich~ said that many

selves more and become more in-
dependent simply in order to af

vive, “If the safe thing to be was
quiet, well- behaved, pleasing,
and counting on that support
(from men), the numbers of
‘women in poverty and the number
of middle-class women who use
tranquilizers - would not ‘be so
high.”

Minnich received her Ph.D. in
philosophy from the New Schoof

in New York. She is a professor at

the Union Graduate School and is°

a regular contributor to scholarly .

journals. She is currently review-
ing high school and college cur-
