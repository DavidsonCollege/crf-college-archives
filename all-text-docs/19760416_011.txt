.. . Exposure aids admissions

[Continued from page 4]

The fame Lefty brought to David-

son was reflected not only in glowing
accounts of college life within the
covers of Sports Illustrated (circ. two
million plus), but in national televi-
sion exposure in both pre-segbon and
post season play.
+ Exposure. which included several
trips to Madison Square Gardens
surely did no harm to the admissions
picture, and contrary to popular
opinion, helped enhance the institu-
tion’s academic reputation. ~w

The accomplishments of those
classes bear us out: witness David-
son’s domination of the GE College
Bowl, burgeoning acceptance rates to
professional schools (which surpass
our slumping records this year), a
wealth of graduate school fellowships
and the plaudits of many well-known
publications. For a school of 1000
males, we were doing all right.

Many professors now long for the
good old days; days where they could
openly resent the basketball program,
enjoy national fame, and teach good
students.

Other facets of college life have
fluctuated with the fate of the
basketball program.

For instance, many alumni contri-
bute more money to a school with a
nationally prominent athletic team.
The school’s extraordinary relation-
ship with the national press encou-
raged large donations and gave
alumni a sense of pride in their school.
In short, the reputation of the college

improved steadily with the success of

Flash was worried and his face
showed it. Things had not been going
well for him since his arrival at the
Academy. It weemed to him that
every day brought him news of a
fallen comrade. The use of the work

“fallen” always caused him to chuc-
kle, it was so military.

Disappeared would be more ac-
curate. At first, there were just
rumors about a missing floor of new
cadets. Then a few of his fellows
began disappearing.

Now he was the only one left on his
floor. Where had they gone?Why had
they disappeared?

His fear was so all consuming he
did not notice the glowing ball in the
center of the room. |

Furthermore, campus morale was
significantly higher than it is today.
After all, how many small liberal arts
colleges can enjoy a dominant basket-
ball team, a pastoral campus and a
fantastic academic reputation? It was
oo having your cake and eating it,

Sure, Harvard can snub athletics
wtih a dilletantish sneer, but they can
rely on a $2 billion endowment and
the best minds and facilities in the
world. We do not have that option. —

Basketball was our ticket to promi-.

nence.
In the face of these facts, it is hard
to understand any attempt to squash
a bid for a second honeymoon with the
national press. Common sense com-
mends a move back to basketball.

And for the academic purist, the
record of graduating roundball greats
is anything but a source of embar-
rassment.

A partial list reads like this: Don
Davidson“‘65--Pennsylvania Med.

a Rhodes Scholar), Pinky Hatcher

festival overture in the background.

scholarship are incommensurable is a
false one. In fact, athletic prowess is
not synonymous with mongolism.
Ask Bill Bradley.

If faculty logic holds, professors at

Princeton must be the laughing stock
of the entire Eastern Coast. After all;
they have maintained a competitive
basketball program for the past 15
years.
If faculty logic holds, professors at
Princeton must be cringing in their
carrels at the thought of a Davidson
professor’s disdain of their top 20
basketball team. Imagine! An Ivy
League Institution whose students
succeed in non-academic activities!
It’s enough to make a Davidson
Gentleman upset his tea and crou-
tons.

It may be painful to admit, but an
encyclopedia salesman named Charles
G. Driesell and 15 barbarians put
Davidson College on the map. The
national map, that is. Davidson
emerged as one of the finest educa-
tional institutions in America, at-
tracting the cream of the high school

. crop. And that attraction may have

been due more to Fred Hetzel’s jump
shot than to the pedagogical exploits
of our mentors.

This is not to deprecate the abilities
of the faculty; Davidson would not
have attracted excellent students
were it not for a superior faculty. That
is what separates us from Austin
Peay State University.

But it remains truethat they have
the opportunity to teach better stu-
dents as a result of basketball
prominence. And as for scholastic
embarassment, the faculty’s worries
are unwarranted.

Princeton has maintained a compe-
titive basketball program for the past
15 years; Penn and Columbia have
also shared the national spotlight.
Stanford’s storied athletic history has
not necessitated wholesale enrollment
of cretins, and Yale’s past domination
of swimming competition is well
known. eee

To top it all off, last weekend Duke
University announced a new $13
million fund raising drive for athletic
scholarships and facilities.

Long live Dave Pritchett!

Noble reveals gifts, ©

returns to write again

By JASON NOBLE.
Staff Writer

I, a staff writer, not of the

Davidsonian but for it, I greet thee
reader and lover of comic books. May
the vapors of Vishanti envelope your
vision.

I am astounded! Did I not write to
you of truth, giving you messages of
my heart, messages of truth, and how
am I now met? My articles are halved,
and my parentheses are unscrupu-
lously edited; let us not forget the
monstrosity of totally altering my
headline.

Are you, O editors, so concerned
over your petty journalistic legalities
that you honor them above this word.
[Yes.] Regular articles take absolute
precedence over passages of light and
beauty!

You deceive yourselves! You can-
not gain the eternal by adhering to
the transient. And so I retreated from
you and in my anger, left you without
my treats (as if you might have
noticed, the review was missing last
week). But I forgive you (especially

since no other paper would even think .

of printing this exercise in useless-
ness).

Therefore, herein do I continue to
reveal that which was given to me,
not from Davidson, but from Marvel
and from Atlas and all those others.

As you may recall (you will be
tested on this letter) as you recall in
my last writing(s) (did you actually
think I’d forgive you?) I spoke of the
loner, of the individual who by
him/her self actualized their goals as
only the singular person is capable.

Well, a new revelation was bes-
towed to me just this past weekend.
(Among other things which are
irrelevant at this moment) which
inevitable altered this previous con-
ception (this is not to say I was
mistaken, a foolish idea indeed)
merely I was presented with but
half-truth, and in my enthusiasm did

overemphasize a bit. (What I said still
holds, maybe not as much).

Companionship and teamwork is
just as important (if not more so, but
not by much) as singular accomplish-
ments (God did create women just to
give women a rest), with this in mine
let us turn our minds to the super
groups.

Fantastic Four: billed as“‘the
greatest comic in the world’’, FF as
those in the know, say) fails to live up
to its logo. This comic has unfortu-
nately suffered the same fate as
Spiderman: monstrous mediacrity
due to mass reader demands. Not
much really to say here (I’m just
really feeling nasty at the moment);
artwork is pretty much consistently
acceptable and the writing is pretty
much standard.

A feeling of restraint (at experi-
mentation) is felt to emanate from the
copy as one turns page after page of
predictable, stereotype superhero bit.

Perhaps its most redeeming value
is its frequent introductiomof new
characters (i.e. silver surfer, black
panther), some of which have been
developed enough to merit their own
magazine (i.e. Silver surfer, Black
Panther); however periodical person-
ality guest starring does not a -
worthwhile comic make. “th

Avengers: many were the times in
my naive, innocent, uninnocuous
youth when it seems that the new
Avengers had arrived was I thrown
into violent ecstacy, knowing full well
that I would soon have in my eager
hands the world’s mightiest super-
heroes.

Many are the times in my experi-
enced, guilty (?), knowing maturity
(or a close facsimile, condemns the
Davidson experience) (Don’s got me
wrong, I love this school or else I
wouldn’t be here, right), when finding
new Avengers have come, I am slung
