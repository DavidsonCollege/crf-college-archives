won four silver medals. “I was so amazed
not only by the athletes, but also the
people,” said Berner following her return
from Down Under. “After winning one of
my silver medals, | rode the bus back to
the hotel with the coach and only a couple
other people. When I got off, there were
people there with sparklers and taking
pictures of me. The people truly made the

event a memorable experience."
