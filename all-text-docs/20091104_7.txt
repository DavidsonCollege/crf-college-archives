Halloween ‘09 at
Davidson College

Halloween 2009 at Davidson
College was not just another holi-
day. The tiny, rain-soaked campus
was overrun by bizarre and random
creatures of all shapes and sizes, and
chaos reigned.

Spiderman, grinding up on Little
Bo Peep at Sig Ep, caught a man
in work clothes and thick glasses
trying to cut in. He threw a punch,

“The campus was
overrun by bizarre and
random creatures. ”

only to find that the cutter was none
other than Clark Kent, a.k.a. Super-
man, who tore off his work clothes
and savagely battled his fellow su-
perhero. Bo Peep remained nearby,
beating both men over the head with
her cane.

An English major in a “Free-
dom” T-shirt and a Santa hat con-
fused the masses until he explained
that he was an Independent Clause.
English professors all over campus
gave extra-credit points to students
who mentioned the story in class.

Two separate sets of Teenage

Mutant Ninja Turtles, one comprised

primarily of females and the other
of males, were found mating on the
Vamanos Van. The two referees sit-
ting up front could be heard blowing
their whistles vehemently, signaling
unnecessary roughness.

The Commons staff was out in
full force, mixing liquid concoctions
of the all-you-can-drink variety;
Branjelina took advantage of the
free booze and poured it into several
baby bottles to perk up the fifteen
sleepy children they were dragging
around F.

“Two referees could be
heard signaling unnec-
essary roughness.”

The Cowardly Lion accidentally
bit off Rugrat Chuckie Finster’s
head outside Connor, while the
Scarecrow was torn to pieces by an
enthusiastic panda bear a few feet
away. The Flying Monkeys kid-
napped a delicate butterfly and the
Wicked Witch of the West drooled
on her mini corn dogs in the Out-
post.

The Davidson College Police
Department has decided to omit
these events from the Blotter this
week, since thanks to the costumes,
the identities of the miscreants re-
main a mystery.

DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER _

Marijuana, Meth
Added to List of
Performance-
Enhancing Drugs

Lausanne, Switzerland- In a
statement released Tuesday morn-
ing by the International Olympic
Committee (IOC), President
Jacques Rogges has officially
banned crystal meth and marijuana
from Olympic competition. Fol-
lowing the latest incident of drug
use by high profile athletes sci-
entists have decidedly confirmed
reefer and meth are in fact perfor-
mance-enhancing.

Last week world renowned
tennis juggernaut, Andre Agassi,
attributed much of his success on
the court to his raging addiction
to crystal meth. In his critically
acclaimed autobiography, My
METHods To Tennis, Agassi dis-
cusses his rampant use of the po-
tent substance to improve his ten-
nis game and lead him to several
Grand Slam titles in the 1999 and
2000 seasons. He confesses in his
memoir, “I never really found my
comfort zone on the court until I
cranked my first bag of Twack dur-
ing my finals match against Pete
Sampras at Wimbledon back in
1999. It made me feel so alive, it
made me ready to dominate.”

This is just another headache
the IOC has had to address in
2009. Just last January, 14-time
Olympic gold medal winner, Mi-
chael Phelps, came clean about his
experimentation with glassware
and Buddha cess to improve his
ability to compete. Phelps’ exten-
sive use of marijuana during his
record breaking Summer Olympic
performance was what allowed
him to perform at a “higher” level,
reported Smoke-Show Martinez,
Phelps’ coach/dealer. Phelps al-
legedly released the pictures of
himself ripping a bong. “I couldn’t
keep this a secret. I want to see
people succeed like me- swim-
ming, breaking records, and rising
to the top- all while chiefing the
gas mask in the locker room of the
U.S. Olympic swimming team.”

Rogges claims “he had no
choice” but to ban the substances:
“Tt’s just not fair when you have
guys like Agassi and Phelps using
these sophisticated drugs to gain
the upper hand and lighting up the
rest of the competition.” Further
action has yet to be taken, but
ESPN’s drug analyst Marion Berry
speculates that soon more athletes
will turn to such methods to set
their careers ablaze.

Blade } Nuiner Discussion Opens
New Film Appreciation Program

Davidson— Monday night, the
Biology, Philosophy, Religion, and
English departments contributed
to an interdisciplinary film panel
on the cult classic movie Blade
Runner. By all accounts it was a
marvelous success for students and
faculty alike. CIS Chair Robert
Stacks said, “We hope this is first
of many panels on film and ulti-
mately we would like to offer more
classes on movies. We will offer
a couple more panels throughout
the year.”

The next panel will be held
December 10th and will focus on
social problems presented in Iron |
Man, Con Air, and Battlefield:
Earth. The Con Air panel will
be the capstone presentation by
students and professors from the
English Department’s seminar,
Reading Nicolas Cage: Contem-
porary Fiction and Bazookas.

The Biology Department
hopes to address the growing cli-
mate problems with a screening
of the film Bio-Dome followed
by an interactive discussion with
Pauly Shore. “We are very excited

“The History Depart-
ment will screen Mup-
pet Treasure Island.”

to have Mr. Shore on campus,”
Stacks said. “His curriculum vitae
is very impressive,” Stacks added.

The History Department will
also sponsor a screening of Mup-
pet Treasure Island. “While it

may be a bit dull, this is really the
only historically accurate film that
investigates the political sphere
of the seventeenth century New
World colonies,” said Stacks.

The Department of Religion is
currently debating their next film
screening. Department Chair Rog-
er Bagley explained, “The faculty
can’t reach common ground right
now. At our next departmental
meeting we have to vote: Dogma

ee —

Con Air: Nicolas Cage’s
cinematic triumph will be is
expected to generate hours

of stimulating intellectual
discourse

or Bruce Almighty? I am personal-
ly a huge fan of Morgan Freeman,
so I’m voting for Bruce.”

In a less formal setting, the
sophomores of second Akers will
get high and watch Harold and
Kumar Go to White Castle next
Tuesday. “I am not sure how we
are going to incorporate that into
the formal schedule,” Stacks said,
“but it’s definitely worth your time
to check it out and hear the discus-
sion. It should be fascinating.”

Major Disappointment:
The Yowl’s Handy Guide

Major: Biology

Reasons people choose this
major: Pre-med; they enjoy slicing
carcasses open; sitting in labs is
better than socializing with others;
no creativity or sense of humor.

Why people avoid this major:
Running to check on a Petri dish
at 11pm on a weekend night is
not their idea of a good time; they
don’t want to sit through labs they
get no extra credit for; they would
rather analyze the hell out of soci-
ety or art instead of cells; anatomy
in practice is more fun than anato-
my in theory.

Career options: Doctor; sur-
geon; environmentalist; veterinari-
an; geneticist; Bill Nye left a pretty
big slot open, why not fill that?

Description: Biology majors
do indeed walk among us in fair
numbers at Davidson College.
While not off exploring the cross
country trails for insects or map-
ping the human genome, they
might be found watching the Dis-
covery channel or reading a book
about diseases for fun. They tend
to be serious-minded, work-ori-
ented individuals who enjoy prob-
lem-solving and digging into the
concrete realities of life on Earth.
Unfortunately, it can be difficult
for arts and humanities majors to
find Biology people since so much
of their time is concentrated in
labs or taking untimed take-home
tests.
