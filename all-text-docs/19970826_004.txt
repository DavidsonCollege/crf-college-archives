increase Davidson’s diversity
through a larger applicant pool.

“Our challenge is going to be
to repeat this in the coming year,”
Cable said.

And the students are as nu-
merous as they are rigorous and
diverse.

Residence Life Office num-
bers peaked at 486 early in the
summer which would have cre-
ated 46 triples (138 students in
triples). It is normal for numbers
to drop slightly over the summer,
and for the first time RLO staff
‘| looked forward to that decrease.
Ultimately, although 440 was
originally targeted, 476 students
became the Class of 2001. »
Housing all students became easier
after ROTC moved from Base-
ment Belk to Johnston Gym. A
capital project was created to raise
$100,000 for the renovated rooms,
and the physical plant finished
work just as freshmen were ready
to arrive.

RLO will leave its present lo-
cation for what will be
Basement West so that
12 bed spaces can be
| opened by January. At
| that time, 153 students
are scheduled to return
from experiences abroad.

Cable attributes in-
creased class size to the
large applicant pool.
Davidson accepted the
common application for
the first time this year, of
which 20 percent of its
applicants took advan-
tage. The College also
created a second early de-
cision option this year.

New, larger crop of _ enters

Early Decision I applications
were due Jan. 1 with notification
by Feb. 1. Although it was still
binding, ‘it gave students who
missed the Nov. 1 Early Decision
I deadline a little more time to
apply.

Now that Admissions and Fi-
nancial Aid have finished their
job for the Class of 2001, they are
beginning to prepare for 2002.
Dean Cable only hopes that the
freshman class “come and engage
inthis community as they appeared
to be able to in their applications.”

“There are not just great stu-
dents here,” Dean of Students Tom
Shandley said. “There are amaz-
ing students here.”

In time-honored fashion, the
class of 2001 has been committed
to. the traditional Davidson wel-
come: Freshman Orientation.

Contrary to popular belief,
freshman often emerge feeling as if
they’ve all been to summer camp
rather than being oriented to the
lifestyle of a college student.

So their elder schoolmates of-

ferthem invaluable advice that may .

only be learned through veteran
experience.

“Don’t send your good clothes
to the laundry,” junior Jenny Nolan
advises regarding the appropriate
use of Davidson’ s auxiliary services.

Only high-endurance clothes,

that resist shrinking and don’t mind
a little extra starch should be sent
into the capable hands of our laun-
dry service.

Take advantage of campus re-
sources and pay attention to the
union calendar of events.

Although freshman are inun-
dated with information their first
five days at Davidson, “they should

definitely read the Wildcat Hand- |

book cover to cover,” senior Mel-

' issa Richter recommends.

Senior Jason Hamrick strongly

suggests that freshmen “never say

wok eee

«ae

‘I don’t have time’” to have fun or
eine! in extracurriculars. “Get
out,” and don’t obsess over aca-
deraicé. :

Pacing yourself and doing ev-
erything in moderation is essential.

A pot of gold?
Diversity at Davidson

By ANN CuLP
Staff Writer

Diversity.

It has become a kind of catch-
word in Davidson lingo, seemingly
as tangible as the pot of gold at the
end of the rainbow.

News analysis —

Director of Residence Life Kurt
Holmes says the school has reached
a sort of “critical mass” so he can
cluster minority students together
naturally.

Assistant Dean for Interna-
tional Student Programs Ruth
Pittard asserts that the 25 interna-
tional students are a strong group of
people who will make a significant
presence at Davidson.

Assistant Dean of Minority Stu-
dent Affairs Ermest Jeffries says
this group is so diverse that we will
see a wide variety of interests among
it.

“In the past, we’ ve tried to put
minority students in clusters dis-
persed around campus,” Holmes
said.

“We know that just because
one is an international student or
racial ethnic doesn’t make you au-
tomatic friends, but we’ve had re-
quests over past years that we at
least put those students in some
proximity.”

This year, that clustering oc-
curred more naturally than previ-
ous years due to a larger number of
minority students.

“The International Students
Association is an organization
which depends on many people,”
Pittard said.

“The more people come in, the
more healthy the organization is
and that means more programming
for the entire campus. The group
that is. here is one of the strongest.
For Davidson students, it is a way to
travel without leaving the country.”

The new students have many
expectations and concerns, though.

“They would like minority rep-
resentation in all school activities
and they are worried about. lack of
African American faculty,” Jeffries
said.
“They would like social outlets
beyond Pattérson Court. They ask
‘Will I have to give up my cultural
identity to fit in at Davidson?’

And, similar to most Davidson

Finally, “don’t be intimidated
by freshman peacocking,” senior
Liz Sale says.

Don’t panic when you realize
that. you are one of the hundred
students who was not in the top

students, they are also worried about
time management.”

Most significant within the
African American freshmen is the
increase in the number of men, now
21, and a general interest in a vari-
ety of activities.

“T think this class was just ; a
reflection of what Davidson looks
for in a student in all aspects,”
Jeffries said.

Davidson also prepared for bet-
ter building access for physically
handicapped people.

RLO added ramps _ to
Richardson and Belk dorms and
made various room renovations to
‘accommodate motorized carts and
wheelchairs.

Pittard remembers atime when
creating diversity at Davidson was
much more difficult.

“About six years ago, the érop
off in international students was
substantial,” she said.

“Most people leave because of
Davidson’s small size, isolation, and
lack of transportation.”

As international and minority
students’ voices become louder,
their Concerns can be better heard
and a stronger sense of community
established.

With the significant number of
these students, Davidson doesn’t
appear as small or isolated.

The pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow is just as intangible, but
diversity doesn’t have to be only a
catch-word at Davidson.
