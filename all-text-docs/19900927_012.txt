New Potato Caboose &
Awareness Art Ensemble

The following show review got
nuked right on out of last week's
paper due to lack of space. Its
message-- Don’t Go Sce the Ca-
boose! --is an important onc. If I
canreach justone readcr this weck,
just one, and spare him the pain-
fully bad show (not to mention the
seven wasted bucks), it will make
this ex post facto review worth-
whilc. Oh God, I hope I’m not too
late.

New Potato Caboose
1313 in Charlotte, 9/13/90.

I bagged doing work for this
show and five minutcs into it I
almost wished I hadn’t. The Ca-
boosc, who rocked atthe Ptcrodac-
tyl last year just didn’thave it (Pctc
Jackson called it when he labeled
them New Potato Impostors). It
was probably because they just
didn’t have their first string drum-
mer and onc of their guitarists.
John, the percussionist in absentia,
was recovering from a hernia op-
cration and Sam, “the new guy” to

Caboose fans, was in Scotland,
evidently having discovercd some
way of simplifying sound board
wiring and was presenting a paper
on it. They were sorely missed.
The Caboose was forced out of
alotof their good material and into
some really random stuff, includ-
ing four covers. “Stir It Up” I’m
certain had Bob M. rolling in his
grave-and “Fire on the Mountain”
was a little sad, but Country Joc
and the Fish and Crosby, Stills and
Nash would have been proud. (Side
note: I hope no onc there actually
did love the onc they were with

because the crowd was really:

skanky all the way around.) In
short, the thirtccnth wasabad night
for Potato heads.

If you get the oppurtunity to
scc them any time soon make sure
the wholc band is going to be there.

Awareness Art Ensemble
Pterodactyl. Date not recallable
(around 9/19/90.)

A sparkling show by natty

dreads. Awareness was complete
and sans politics. In D.C. in ‘88,
Amy Goode (Angel atop the Christ-
mas tree) and I almost got clob-
bered after an onstage discourse
about ANC rubbed some inebri-
ated xenophobes the wrong way.
A near fatal bum rush ensued but
somehow we escaped unscathed
(I’m sure you care).

There were no low points this
time. It was a three hour show in
which their originals were fresh
and their covers were accurate.
“Roller Skates” was the crowd
favorite. The only bad thing I have
toadd was the bands appearance. It
looks as if they are getting a little
bumtoutand sick of theclubscene.
Although the tuncs were vibrant,
the group didn’t scem to be having
fun. This is all just speculation of
course.

Thanks for reading.

Sherrill Reflects on World War II

know what I saw? I saw this Ger-
man tank run right through the
middlc of that tent, rightover them
guys. It was awful.”

But Kempalsohas some plcas-
ant memories from the front. “I
uscd to drive a lot for Omar Bra-
dley. I picked him of at the airport
once. They was all goin’ to that
place where they signed the peace
trcatics for World War I. 1 got back
and they tcll me Patton’s driver
wrecked and can I go pick him up.
‘Sure,’ I say.

“So I got Patton and we starts
off. There was two motorcycles in
front of us at first. Patton, you
know whathe did, he calls up tome
and says, “Corporal, will this thing
run?’ ‘Sure,’ I say. “Then blow the
horn and tcll them sons of b-----s to

pull over.’ So I did, and he says,
‘Let’s go.’

“T throwed it in fifth, and I tell
you, I gothim there fast. Well, and
this’Il give you a chuckle, it was
snowing pretty good, and I was
driving one of them English cars,
you know, all backwards with the
stecring whecl on the wrong side
and the doors open the opposite
way. Well I pulled in, and Patton,
he jumps out before I stopped, and
that door opened up behind him
and come up and knocked him flat
on his ass."

"He slid along there a ways,
got up, brushed the snow off them
two pistols he carried and started
off. I think I’m the only one ever

knocked Patton down and gotaway
with it.”

Pll take that bet.

After the war Kemp returned
home to Mooresville Mills and met
his wife, Geneva. A year or so later
he Ieft the mill and started K. K.
Sherrill’s Texaco and ran it for
twenty-cight ycars. The building
sull stands. To getthere “you go up
77 to 150, take a right, then go
down a hill and up a hill and its on
the Icft. It’s called ‘Miller’s Car-

"] think I’m the only
one ever knocked Pat-
ton down and got away
with it."

most about Davidson, and he said,
“T just like being around the kids
and the professors. They’ve all
Icarncd me a lot. Every one of
those professors knows me. I en-
joy mysclf, give people a smile and
speak with them if they want. It’s
what keeps me goin’.”

When I asked if he saw any-
thing at Davidson that bothered
him or thathe might want changed,
Kemp pondered awhile and shook
his head.

“WecllI do remember one time
itsnowed real good and my scooter
was stuck at the bottom of the hill.
Some boys helped me up the hill
and then they wouldn’t Ict me go.
They spun me around for a while
there in a circle. They had their
fun.”

“Did that bother you?”

The Incredible Ease

of Well-Being

Yes, Men Can Drink
More Than Women

Now. that-all-of this-Alcohol
Policy stuff is going down, let’s
talk about alcohol!

BAL: Although it is generally
thoughtofasa stimulant because it
makes pcople more aggresive,
talkative, and uninhibited, alcohol
is actully a depressant which acts
as an anesthetic to the nervous
system. Blood Alcohol Level
(BAL) is the amount of alcohol in
the bloodstream.

The amount a person drinks
(see the chart on Blood Alcohol
Content) affects BAL, as well as
the type of alcohol consumed and
what it is mixcd with. Whisky and
other hard liquors are absorbed
morc quickly into the bloodstream
than beer, and carbonated mixers
also incrcase absorption rate.

Eating before drinking will
delay an incrcasc in BAL. Milk
products before a beerfest will help
to coat the lining of the stomach
and prevent alcohol from being
absorbed into the bloodstream as
fast.

If you’re fecling “under the
weather’, you'll probably fecl the
effects of alcohol faster because
although a small percentage of
alcohol is exhaled or excreted, the:
remainder must be oxidized by the
liver and this process is slowed by
disease.

Why men can drink women
under the table: Biologically
speaking, this cliche holds true. A
certain dygestive enzyme, “alco-
hol dchydrogenase”’, breaks down
some alcohol before itever reaches
the bloodstream and can effect the
central nervous system. Women
have significantly less of this en-
zyme than men do.

For this reason, and also the
fact that women on the average
tend to weigh less than mcn, women

absorb as muchas 30% more aleo-
hol into the bloodstream than men.
All in all, for every two drinks a
man has, a woman can have one
and still feel the same effects. Men
have a distinct metabolic advan-
tage (or disadvantage?) in this
respect. z

Nutritional aspects: Basi-
cally, zip. Empty calories. Pilsner,
Amber, Lager and Bock beers all
have about the same caloric con-
tent. For a Lager beer (3.8% alco-
hol and 12 oz of beer), a “light”
beer has around 105 - 110 calorics,
and a regular beer has about 160.

Thedifference betwecn the two
isless calories thanan apple. Darker
beers have slightly more calorics
than lighter oncs, and this pertains
to liquors as well. Most “light”
becrs, interestingly cnough, have
just as many if not morc calorics

_ than their “dry” counterparts, be-

cause of the brewing process for
“dry” beer.

As far as liquor goes, an 80
proof (40% alcohol by volume) .
bottle of distilled liquor -- scotch,
gin, vodka, rye, brandy, ctc. -- has
around 67 calories per fluid ounce.
Liquor that is 151 proof (75.5%
alcohol) has 126 calories per 0z:, ,
and Everclear has around 166 calo-
ries per 0z:(To give you some idea
of how much“onc ounce” is, there
are about two ounces of liquor ina
frozen drink made with Bacardi
mixers.)

Neither beer nor liquor has fat
in it; beer has carbohydrates, but
none of the nutricnts that bread
has. The reason people gain weight
through dinking beer is because
they arc taking in lots of extra
calorics on a regular basis, and
they are usually drinking late at
night when there is no time to
immediately work it off.

Like every other job he has.

held (cxceptmaybe farming) Kemp
loved running the station. “I did
greasc jobs, changed oil and
workcd on cars. Towards the end
we sold minners and fishin’ tackle

_ after they opened Lake Norman.”

Since he Ieft the station Kemp
has been at Davidson, and he still
loves to work. “I lock doors, check
for blown lights . . . they’ve really
lit this place up, makcs it safer...
I unlock dorm rooms and profes-
sor’s offices if people lock their
keys inside. I like to help people
out.”

I asked Kemp what he likes

“Oh no, I enjoyed them.”

So much for.negativism.

If yousce Kemp say hi. Some-
limes you'll find him at the Union
taking a smoke or driving around
in his. plain brown Cushman. (He
had them paint over the “Davidson
Sccurity” logo “because I ain’t no
policeman.”) He always has time
to help out a student. “People got
to remember, if it weren’t for the
students, we wouldn’t have any
jobs.” He has no plans to quit his
part time work. As he says, “Oh
boy, I just can’t sit around and do
nothin’.” His wife also works at
Davidsonasacook for Rusk House.
“She loves to cook.”

We’re lucky to have them.

Tracks Amelia Earhart

Continued from Page 11
thick, snake-like tangles of tropi-
cal underbrush greet visitors who
make the long journey there.

After days of combing the is-
land last year, the TIGHAR team
concluded that Earhart’s Electra
was not on land and decided to
look through the village debris for
anything that would have come off
an airplane.

They found the bookcase ona
junkpile, said Matthews. Only after
close examination and with help
from the Smithsonian Institute did
the team realize the significance of
their find.

Matthews hopes to be on the
next TIGHAR expedition to
Nikumaroro, possibly next fall,
when the group will carry deep
water sensing instruments to search
for Earhart’s plane in the depths
around the atoll. The project will
cost around $250,000, Matthews
estimates. “It’snotlike we’re going
after a Spanish treasure; if we find

anything we’re not gonna scll it.
There’re film rights and television
rights that would defray the costs,
but basically what we're doing is
not for profit,” Matthews said, “It’s
really a labor of love.”

Matthews took a month off
from class last year to volunteer
his time on the expedition.

Eventually he hopes to be a
filmmaker,. so. when TIGHAR—
asked him to filmthe triphe jumped
at the opportunity.

In 1987, he made a video of a
TIGHAR project about the miss-
ing French aircraft “Midnight
Ghost.” Butthe Earhart expedition
was different. For him it was a—
chance to solve one of the more
well-known mysteries of the 20th -
century.

“I’ve got so much invested i in
this now that I’d hate to go to my
doorstep one morning and pick up
a paper and have it say ‘Earhart
mystery solved.’ I want to be there
when it happens.”
