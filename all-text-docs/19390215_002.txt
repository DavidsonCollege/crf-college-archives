Wasted Education

American colleges for teachers are “wast-
ing money on too many stupid students.”

That is the conclusion of Dr. Herbert L.
Spencer, noted educator, based on a survey
of sophomores in Pennsylvania colleges. In
the group surveyed students preparing tor
teaching had an average score of 211 in in-

fell within the same range of scores, and
25 per cent of the prospective teachers knew
less than the top fourth of the high school
seniors. ;
Pennsylvania, it seems, is saddled with
great numbers of teachers who rank lower
than the boys and girls they are to lead
upon the paths of learning, There’ is no
reason to believe that the situation in our

servers have long suspected that one of the

South’s chief educational ills was mass pro-
duction of teachers who neither knew their
subject matter nor had the native ability to
teach it.

The answer is difficult to find, It seems
that the South should in some way super-
vise the selection of candidates for entrance
to our teacher preparation institutions. But
until more financial inducement is offered
to young people, the teaching profession
Will continue to find itself with a perennial
shortage of mental equipment.

Take Heed

Our newspapers almost daily carry stories
automobile accidents in which a few
more lives are snuffed out. All too often
the victims are children. For this reason
and because of several requests we are re-
printing the following poem which appear-
ed in The Davidsonian about a year ago:

THE RECKLESS FOOL...

HAVE YOU ever heard the rattle of a dy-
ing man’s last breath?

of

Or seen the look of horror in the stare that
faces death?

Have you ever heard a person scream and
writhe in sudden pain

And look down at.a mangled arm that will
not move again.2»

Or have you heard the moaning and smell-
ed the stench of gin

And seen the gory, bloody gap where once
an eye had been?’

When your car is doing fifty, have you ever
felt the yen

To let ’er have another notch ’n do an-
other ten?

When a pokey guy’s ahead of you, have you
ever had the thrill

Of swingin’ out’n passin’ him: upon a dan-
gerous hill?

Or have you ever felt the old car scream

‘n lurch ’n swerve

As you let ’er have the limit while you took

a sudden curve?
Have you ever seen the wreckage of an
automobile crash,

With

gruesome hash?

flesh and steel made into a morbid,

Have you ever seen the entrails ’n the ears

‘n arms ’n hand

‘N hat 'n shoes ‘n fingers of what once had
been a man?

Have you ever seen the jagged bone stick
through a mangled leg

And heard the brood-smeared victim pray
n cfy ’n bege

HAVIE YOU ever had the keen sensation of
a fast car at your bid

‘N run up to a stop sign ’n slap ’em on ’n
skid ?

Did you ever pass a school-yard ’n give the
horn a slam

'N drive close to a gang o’ kids ’n see ’em
jump ’n scram?

Did you ever take a quart o’ rye ’n swal-
low four or five

'N take the old bus down the road ’n show
‘em how to drive?

Have you ever seen a little child all crum-
pled up ’n still—

Who tried to run across the street while a
car came down the hill?

Have fenders?

Have you seen blood in the steet ?

you seen men’s brains on

Have you seen them stare at the bloody
stumps of things that once were their
feet?

Have you ever heard the crash ’n scream

‘n seen the ghastly stare
On the of what had been the driver
‘n the rest of the man not there ?

Morbid ‘n gruesome gory this, I’m sorry,
but don’t you see,
This was not meant to be read by folks as

tender as you ’n me,

It was meant for the thoughtless ’n

Campus Comments

Every student who has taken Dr. Sen-
telle’s philosophy and lots of others who
haven't, know the fallacious argument of
the ancient Greeks, that since one millet
seed falling upon the ground makes no
noise, neither will a bag of falling seeds.
If youe must have the fallacy accurately
stated, you had better ask the philosophy
boys, but fér my purposes, just realizing
the flaw in the argument is sufficient. And
if you are one of the conscientious boys
who spends his time deploring conduct in
chapel, I just want to suggest that you
probably have been judging yourself by the
standard of the argument I have mentioned,

Time after time it happens. One day you
hear some student verbally belaying his
fellows for lack of consideration and posi-
tive disrespect in chapel. The next day you
see him whispering quietly to his neighbor
during the prelude. I meant to say, “You
see him whispering.” You can’t hear him.
But you realize fully that the reason for
the general hubbub is just a lot of other
people whispering too.

Talk, inside or outside chapel, won’t help
the situation. Nothing will, at least not un-
til the students really concerned about the
matter realize that in many cases they
themselves are contributing to the uproar.
We will have reverence, quiet, attention, or,
whatever you want to call it, only when
each man learns to control himself abso-
lutely, without any lapses of vigilance.

If the situation bothers you, do some-
thing about it. Keep quiet, absolutely quiet,
all the time, yourself,

Honorary Fraternity Council.

Forensic Council, to write the next

Nomination

Although 1940 is politically a long
time away—many months in which
anything can happen in the realm
of those who bargain for votes and
pork barrels—collegians have al-
ready started thing about the Pres-
idential campaign. First to come out
into the open on the whole ques-
tion is the Butler University Col-
legian, which proposes that Secre-
tary of State Cordell Hull be the
Democratic nominee for the next
resident of the White House.

Why? Listen to this: “Mr. Hull
is, we believe, the one man in the
Democratic party today who could
unite the conservative and liberal
elements. He has supported the rad-
ical New Deal measures only mild-
ly, and also has backed the con-
servative actions of the administra-
tion.”

Will the Collegian’s nominee
come through? What do you think?

Marriage

Collegians in all sections of
the U. S. are clamoring for courses
that will tell them all about the
trials and tribulations of marriage
and how they can be avoided.
Simply stated by the Harvard Uni-
versity Crimson, they say: “It is
becoming increasingly important
that mature men and women should
have some knowledge about birth
control and the many causes of
divorce. Also they should know

something of the effects such dif-
ferences as age, class, grade, religi-
on, occupation, politics, hobby, col-
or and sex have upon marital rela-
tions. Expert information on such
subjects ought to be available to
college students.” That the new
movement is not new on all camp-
uses is shown by the fact that 200
colleges and universities already
have such courses. Growth of the
movement is shown by the fact that
there were only 22 such courses
12 years ago.

Health

Recent
every

revelation that two out
thousand U. S. college
students are infected with syphilis
has started anew the clamor for
mass examination of all college stu-
dents. Says the Kent Stater of Kent
State University, in agreeing with
other editorialists in all sections of
the country:

“Colleges should acknowledge
their responsibility. Instruction a-
bout venereal diseases should be in-
cluded in the regular curriculum,
Authorities agree that control must
begin with individuals in the age-
group of first exposure. College stu-
dents form the most important
group in this class. Control in this
group would offer a real hope for

reduction in the. general rate of in-
fection.”

SUPER SNOOPINGS

By KEN LAWSON

Mid-Winters, the week-end ‘for
which young Davidsons live from
New Years on has come and gone.
For most there is an eager waiting
until the time for this gala occasion
rolls around next year, while for
some of us it is with sadness that
we contemplate the passing of our
last Mid-Winter dance set.

Among the alumni returning for
the festivities were four old Pan-
Hellenic Council Presidents—Mims
Rogers, Cokey Branton, Ed Arm-
field, and Boobie Arrowsmith—back
to see President Pittman and the
Council stage the largest and best
dance set ever put on at Davidson.
I am sure that they join with us
in paying tribute to the work of
this year’s Council which produced
such noteworthy results.

But this column is not intended
to give glowing praise about the
headliners of the week-end, no mat-
ter how well deserved it may be;
it is to delve into the by-lines and
let you in on a few not so well
known facts and activities. E

Without attempting to enumer-
ate all the lovely and charming
young ladies who graced the dances,
cannot pass over without men-
tioning a few items of interest.

their eighth Davidson Mid-Winters;

have added much to the enjoyment
of Davidson dance functions. We

But not until we say that local
scholars should have amply proved
to the Pan Hell boys that they can
and will support a’ big name band
when given the opportunity, and
that we're tactfully suggesting Lar-
ry Clinton for that set once cele-
brated as Bowery Ball and Junior

Of course we would like to tell
you about songstress Judy Starr's
feeling too badly to attend the tea

showing up for their».banquet a
night early, or the band’s profes-

jitterbugs. Discouraged, just
didn’t send any.

With romance still burning fit-

thought we’d drop in on the Da-
vidson telegraph office, and so we
did. Those special Valentine ’grams
were selling very well, we learned.
Without attempting to interpret
the facts, we'll also report that busi-
ness is considerably better than it
was for the same occasion last year,
also that about four such messages
go out for every one that comes
in. Most boys, they told us, just

personality, so eventually we gave
up and decided to forget the whole
business.

SLEEPING SICKNESS... Dur-
ing the lecture of one of our pro-
fessors lately, a member of the class
(no matter who; it could have hap-
pened to you) suddenly slumped
Over against the man in thé desk
at his side, victim of sudden sick-
ness. The professor was the first
to notice. He stopped his lecture

and had the boy assisted from the

whom the sufferer had collapsed.

“No, he replied. “I just
