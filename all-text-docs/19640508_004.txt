After Vespers

THE DAVIDSONIAN

GOD AND MAN
AT DAVIDSON

Responses varied last week as two groups
made their appeal to the Davidson student
during vacant chapol periods. Accused of
“apostacy” by a national magazine last fall,
most Davidson students steered their apa-
thetic paths clear of both gatherings.

The YMCA-sponsored voluntary chapel
program—featuring a different student lead-
er at each service—is slated each Wednesday
in Lingle Chapel. The attendance at a recent
service (left) stood at four.

As yet unorganized, the Humanist Club
brought Unitarian minister Sidney Freeman
to campus two days later (right). Invited by
unofficial Humanist head Bill Ferris, Free-
man spoke to a total of 32 people.
