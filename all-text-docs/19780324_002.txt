Zimmermann readies code

Vice President for Academic Affairs T.C. Price Zimmermann
indicated Tuesday that the faculty code of evaluation is in its final

drafts. Lt will be submitted to the Professional Affairs Committee .

(PAC) sometime next week.

The code, which is stipulated in Article 10, Section 12 of the
College Constitution, has been developed by Zimmermann and
College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. during the last several
weeks. It calls’ for a formal mechanism for review of all faculty

members.

After a period of scrutiny by the PAC and the student body, the
proposals will go before the Board of Trustees at their May

meeting.

Zimmermann noted, ‘‘Some people are looking at it as a cure-all.
This is not the case. It just sets down criteria for the evaluations
and the manner in which they are applied.” Zimmermann stressed
that exercise of the code would still incorporate an element of
judgment and discretion on the part of the administration.

The Davidsonian

Stuart Scholars announced

By DENNIS McLAWHORN
“News Editor

This year’s recipients of the
Edward Crosland Stuart Scho-
larships were announced Wed-
nesday.

The winners are Richard oF
Gergoudis of Richmond, Va.,
Moffat G..McDonald of Green-
wood, S.C., Parks H. Snead,
III, of Amherst, Va., and Craig
J. White, of Huntersville, N.C.

The winners were selected
form a field of over 300 nomi-
nees throughout the Southeast.
From that field, 64 were chosen
as district semi-finalists, and 16
finalists were picked from that

group to come to Davidson for |

final interviews, held last week.

The scholarship program has
been expanded since it was
begun last year. Four full
scholarships totalling over
$20,000 each were awarded this
year. Last year two students
each received a $3000 scholar-
ship, and seven others each'
received a $500 grant.

“It was difficult to choose

four scholarship recipients from

our 16 outstanding finalists,”
said Seddon Goode, chairman of
the scholarship program’s
board of directors.

“But we feel these four young
men are superb examples of the
qualities of life for which we
remember Ed Stuart.”

Another change in this year’s
selection process which allowed

visiting theologians have
taught courses fall and winter
terms. Therefore, Michalson
(former Professor of Religion
Gordon E. Michalson) was es-
sentially replaced. Dr. Ostwalt
(Professor of Education and
Psychology J.H. Ostwalt) was
just something we can’t pre-
dict-~
Zimmermann said no com-
plaints had reached him from
faculty about being overloaded
with independent studies, ex-
tended studies, 301’s and 401’s.
Zimmermann also
commented on the problem of
ceilings. ‘‘We will study ceil-
ings. I understand that the
faculty policy is no course
should be set under 25 except
for special conditions. Within
the present limits of the 13 to 1
student faculty ratio, in order to
have small courses in advanced
areas, it may be necessary to
have larger introductory
classes. It may be necessary for
the EPC to look at the whole
enrollment pattern in courses.”’
Terry said, ‘‘I think one thing
that needs to be said, I really
think that some faculty and
department heads really need a
pat on the head for raising
ceilings and helping the situa-
tion.’’ However, Terry realized
raising ceiling deprives
students already in the classes
from one of Davidson’s trad-
itions, small classes.
Zimmermann hopes to help
the problem by -utilizing the full
day, He said, ‘‘The new regist-

ering procedure for labs is

‘laying the groundwork for af-
3 BNE ht Pa he a a a Te ce ae

ternoon classes to get maximum :

use of our resources and diver-
sity the large number of avail-
able hours.

Terry said, ‘‘We’re going to
have to break some patterns for
things like scheduling.’’ He also
pointed out another problem
with afternoon classes is sports.

Registration forms also seem
to contribute to the problem,
either through errors on the
part of the student or failure to
use the form to the best
advantage. Zimmermann
believes ‘‘what’s lacking is a
will on the part of the student to
understand the process.’” How-
ever, Terry feels the registra-
tion form because it has so

many spaces encourages stu-,

dents ‘to put down courses they
don’t really want just to fill it
up.

Besides differing views on
registration forms, Terry and
Burts differed on their views of
add-dron

According to Burts, ‘“There
was a lot of add-drop this term.
A lot of that goes into attitude.
We had many, many students
who would add a course in the
morning and then try to drop it
in the afternoon. I think that
shows the attitude some stu-
dents have about add-drop.
They'll. add and drop courses
rather casually bécause they
can change it rather easily.”

Terry said, ‘I've often found
add-drop is a wonderful oppor-
tunity for a student who wants
to work at it to get the courses
he wants. This time there
wasn’t the elasticity.”

Another major factor is the

+i popularity. of. certain courses.

Zimmermann reflected, ‘One
problem of the. popularity of a
course is often because of the
professor. And student interest
changes. There will always be
one area hotter than others--it
fluctuates. If we’re going to
offer majors, we can’t emaciate
departments. There will always
be some bunching.”

Zimmermann also said, ‘One
of the things, of course, that the
administration tries to do is to
make sure we have the best
possible faculty. We try to
appoint faculty who are good
teachers and who have a strong
student following. If we don’t,
we have a problem. We want
the general level of instruction
to be so high students will want
to take a wide variety of
courses.”

Another factor in the problem
is that some ‘‘introductory’’
courses are not really suitable
for most freshmen, who lack the
necessary background in writ-
ing, organizing, and dealing
with particular types of think-
ing, and academic knowledge.

These and other factors com-
bined to produce the problem,
according to Terry. Primarily
freshman and sophomores were
hurt in the course crunch. Terry
also pointed out that the pro-
blem with courses this term put

an added constraint on soph- —

omores. for distribution
requirements.

Another result of the regis-
tration problem were shortages,
of books. Nichols said, “I would
guess there were 20° or 30
courses where we had to re-
order, and by the same token,

we’re way over on just as many

students from states other than
North Carolina and Florida to
compete for the scholarships.
The awards are named for a
1954 Davidson graduate who

died in a Navy plane crash. ‘The
Edward C. Stuart Foundation
of Florida and Stuart’s fellow
Davidson alumni laa the

funds.

Metzel remarked, ‘‘I applied
for it because I want to do
something in terms of deve-
lopement in the Third World.
Eventually, I suppose I plan to

re-orders to speed getting the
books. The time it takes to get
them varies with the publisher,
but Nichols said, ‘‘Most of them
come in in a week or so.” This
year the heavy snows up north
delayed shipping of the books.
However, Nichols said a great
many of the re-orders have
already come in.

Nichols observed, . ‘‘More
books were left over than usual.
We were short more books per
course. In the past, we’d may
be short ten or fifteen. There
may be more students without |
books, but not more courses
short of books.”

Terry said, ‘It’s a very
complicated problem,’’ but
Burts remarked optimistically,
“TI think everything is going to
check out in good order.”’

and see where I would best fit

about what I’m going to do.”’

Metzel remarked, ‘‘I hope to
use mine as part of a graduate
paper or something to be pu-
blished in journals or newspa-
pers.’ :

Craig exclaimed, ‘‘I was just
in a daze. We’re both still

“It’s a super opportunity. I
am excited. I’m sure we’re both
going to try to get as much out
of it as we can.”’ Metzel added.

Dean of Students Will Terry
said, ‘‘We’re excited about ha-
ving two Watsons again. It’s
significant and we're pleased.”’

Metzel explained, ‘‘My pro-
posal is basically to look at
transportation systems between
countries in terms of their —
prospects for helping their de-
velopement through trade and
so on.”’

‘I’m examining three intra-
African transportation projects
including the Tanzam railroad,
the Trans Sahara Highway, and
the integrated transportation
system of the East African
Community which had harbors,
railroads, and airlines to help
integrate the trading market
between Kenya, Tanzania, and
Uganda.”’

its precise functions need to be
defined.

Both agree: that they don’t
have any diffe: neces concerning
the program:. they
initiate and that they don’t

foresee any problem in working

“together. Jackson pointed out

that they had worked together
before on the Athletic Commit-
tee.

Brown revealed, ‘I plan to
give John a lot. of responsibility
with many of my formal duties.
As Vice-President, Jackson will
head the Residence Hall Coun-
cil. Jackson said, ‘I feel like

want to.

there’s enthusiasm on the coun-
cil.’’ He also reiterated that it’s
feasible to work out a plan for
buying bulk lumber.

Jackson said, ‘‘We’re both
pretty excited about the Senate
doing things that are original
and ambitious.’”” An example of
this, which they propose, would
be to have two night exam
periods.

Brown repeated, ‘‘We’re both
enthusiastic. We expect an
ambitious Senate because it’s
proven that it has some power.
I want the Senate to- use all of
its potential value that has
developed from a good founda-
tion under Thom Young.”’
