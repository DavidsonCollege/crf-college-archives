which we played precisely to our game
plan,” coach Lisa Marston said.

The big showdown was sched-
uled for Sunday .against first-place
Chattanooga. The first game was a
tight 15-13 win for the Mocs.

The Wildcats-responded with a
decisive 15-10 victory in the second
game and took an 8-2 lead in the third.
But the Mocs then staged an incredible

comeback to take the third game 15-9.

In the fourth game, the Wildcats
fought hard and took a 15-10 decision.
Just like fast Sunday, Davidson went
into sudden death for the fifth game.
But unlike that match, the Wildcats
did not come away victorious, losing
15-13.

Despite the tough loss, many team
members were encouraged by the ef-
fort.

“This looked like a true No. |
versus No. 2 matchup,” Marston said.
“We played extraordinarily well, and
there is no way we can have our heads
down about this.”

Junior Emily Willeford said that
the Chattanooga game, coupled with
the strong victory over the Catamounts
on Friday, were “great for our confi-
dence, even though we lost.

“We needed to improve on some
smaller technical things, but overall,
we played quite well.”

Sunday was a special day for two
players. Senior L.A. Bumgarner re-
corded her 1,000th career kill. Her
total at day’s end was 1,007.

And junior Janet Duncan, whose
play Sunday was “incredible,” accord-
ing to Marston, recorded career kill
No. 500.

“Despite this tough loss, this
should help us forthe rest of the sea-
son,” sophomore Ginny Quis said. “We
know we can compete. ;

“And next time, we'll be ready.”

When goalkeeper Allie Noznesky
has a great game and the team still loses,
the opposition must have been incred-
ible. And it was.

Georgia was a rude host to the

“They're closer to a top 25 team
than any other team we've played,”
coach Kevin Hundley said of the Bull-
dogs. “They’re much better than UNCC
and they’re on par with Clemson.
They’re talent level — person for per-
son — is higher than ours.

“The encouraging thing was that
we played with intensity. Allie was

phenomenal. She must have had ten to

fifteen saves, and two or three that were

just spectacular.” :
Noznesky kept the game within

reach, as the Bulldogs were only up I- .

0 at the half. But the Wildcats couldn't
find the back of the net, and Georgia
scored one goal early in the second half
and another in the last 10 minutes.

“We had a few chances and
couldn’t score,” Hundley said.

“We've just got to get on track
offensively.”

The Wildcats now stand at 2-6-2 at
the midway point in the season. Their
next test will come Tuesday night at
Richardson Field against another strong
opponent in UNC Greensboro.’ The
Spartans boast a 10-2 overall record,
including a flawless 4-0 mark in confer-
ence play.

“They’re cruising pretty well right
now,” Hundley said of UNCG.

If Davidson wins, they would still
need help from another team in the form
of a win ora tie with UNCG to take first
place.

“We could realistically finish any-
where from second to sixth,” Hundley
said. “Everybody in the conference but
Greensboro has a loss, so_ it’s wide
open.”

Hundley explained that after
UNGCG there is a cluster of five teams
battling for second.

The last two teams should only get
a win by playing each other.

So the battle for home-field ad-
vantage in the first round of the league
tournament has begun in earnest. Which-
ever teams rise to the top of the
conference’s middle tier will be re-
warded with a postseason home game.

“We believe we can be at the top of
the second tier,” Hundley said.

“That’s our goal.”

Field hockey tops Catawba, falls to Appalachian

Catawba 1 the score
of 3-1.

The Wildcats racked up their fourth
victory of the season against the Lady
Indians of Catawba in impressive fash-
ion.

Attackers Erin Smith and Jennie
Gold each tallied two goals and an as-

sist to lead Davidson to the 4-1 victory.

“This was a fun game for us,”
Smith said. “We stepped up from the
start and made the most of our opportu-
nities. I was really proud of the way the
team played.”

She now leads the team with 15
points, and Gold is second with nine.
Sara Gebhardt did well in goal, record-
ing 11 saves to push her season total up
to 119.

“We did a good job finishing on
offense today, but we let up a little on
defense in the second half, which gave
them a few opportunities,” coach Jenni-
fer Blizzard Halliday explained.

“Kate Schoening played a particu-
larly strong game in the field for us.”

Sunday was a different story, as

the Wildcats were beaten by Deep South
rival Appalachian for the second time
intwo weeks. The Mountaineers opened
up a two goal lead in the first half and
managed to fend off Davidson’s come-
back effort in the second period.
Defender Lindsey Parker scored
the Wildcats’ only goal on a penalty
corner midway through the second half.
“This was a well-fought battle,”
Halliday said. “There was a lot of
emotion out there, and it showed.
“We dominated the stats today,
but unfortunately we couldn't convert.”
The Wildcats now go on the road
for six straight games, facing a string of
tough opponents in American Univer-
sity, Virginia Commonwealth, and Wil-
liam and Mary.

Harriers place second at pre-conference meet

By Bratron Homes
Staff Writer

Riding the momentum of solid
performances in last week’s Greens-
boro Invitational, both the men’s and
women’s cross country teams had re-
spectable meets Saturday at the pre-
conference meet in Statesboro, Ga.

Georgia Southern hosted the meet
that included conference rival Furman
and three other non-conference teams.
Both squads placed second out of six,
with conference powerhouse Furman
claiming first place in both the men’s
and women’s divisions.

Just as men’s coach Gary Andrew
predicted in the preseason, the sopho-
mores continued to carry the team. Four
of Davidson’s top five runners in the
meet were sophomores. Brent Ferrell
finished first for the Wildcats and fourth
overall with a time of 26:46, his per-

sonal best for the season.

Rookie Neil Burt, who last week
registered the fastest time ever by a
Davidson runner on the Greensboro
course, finished only a second behind
Ferrell and was the only non-sopho-
more in the top five.

Thomas McElveen also registered
a personal best, taking third for Davidson
and finishing in 27:37. Pat Burchett
and William Isenhour rounded out the
Wildcats top five with times of 28:06
and 28:26, respectively.

Senior Tim O’ Keefe was the third
Wildcat to register a personal best, fin-
ishing at 28:36. Junior Rick Cratsenberg
competed in his first meet of the season
and finished four seconds behind
O'Keefe.

Andrew stated that he was pleased
with the team’s effort and the perfor-
mance of Ferrell and Burt, who hung
with the Furman runners the entire way.

Women’s coach Beth Puckett sim-
ply instructed her team to run hard.
They did soand had satisfactory results.

Puckett described the team’s per-
formance as “a good meet, but not a
great meet,” and also stated that, with
improved conditioning and experience
on the Statesboro course, the team could
have a better finish in the conference
championship.

Suzy Burr once again led the pack
for Davidson, finishing in 18:53. Rook-
ies Smyth Bitter and Jill Neumayer
continued to play a crucial role for the
team by finishing second and third.

* Kelly Kiefer came in fourth, fol-
lowed by Clair Frey and Katie Lannon.
The Wildcats’ point total was hurt when
Allie Curran, one of the team’s best
runners, did not finish the race due to
the weather conditions. Without Curran,
the team finished with 43 points to
Furman’s 23.
