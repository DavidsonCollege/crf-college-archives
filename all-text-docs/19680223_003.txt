Apathetic Not Indifferent

By BOB DUNHAM
News Editor

Although the Davidson stu-
dent generally is not willing
to become actively involved
in issues beyond his text-
books, he still maintains an
active concern for these is-
sues.

Such was the opinion of a
cross-section of Davidson stu-
dents, faculty, and adminis-
tration when they were ques-
tioned about the supposed ap-
athy of the Davidson student
body.

Most of the people express-
ing opinions agreed with the
opinion of psychology profes.
sor William G. Workman,
who commented that ‘‘David-
son merely lacks the critical
mass necessary to trigger an
explosion.”

“There simply aren't
enough students here for our
school to be like Berkeley,”
he said. “If we had 10,000
Davidson students, we svould

probably be more aware of
active involvement and par-
ticipation among students in
regard to major issues."

Workman added that this
does not necessarily indicate
apathy. ‘“‘We have to look at
such apathy in the terms of
the world beyond Davidson.”
he said.

“We. say that the Davidson
student needs to care more
about what is happening,"’ he
continued, ‘‘and it is healthy
to compare Davidson with
the ideal. However, we must
stop to compare ourselves
with the realistic.”

“The problem here is that
the students here have such
a narrow base of compari-
son,” said Workman. ‘Very
few students have any real
experience with other schools
on which to base a -compari-
son."

Assistant Dean of Students
Jim Terry acknowledged the
lack of involvement on the
part of the Davidson student,
but he said that it was due.
in his opinion, to the “har-
monious blend of the student
cross-section. which tends to
obscure any isolated views or
actions."’

Terry stated that he felt
there were several reasons
for this lack of involvement.

“Most students decide be
fore they even arrive as
freshmen that they don't
want to get involved.”” he
said. “This usually results in
no involvement. in anything
other than classwork until
the junior or senior year.”

“Other students are .so in-
volved in academic self-sur-
vival,’ said Terry, “that they
are afraid to take time for
other interests.’’

Terry noted the recent stu-
dent vote on the Student Gov-

ernment Association constitu-
tion as an example of this
failure of the student to get
excited about major issues.

“How long does it take to
cast a ballot?” he asked.
“And yet so few are willing
to take the moment to ex-
press their interest. Certain-
ly the few seconds it takes to
cast the ballot are not wast-
ed.”

“A good number are con-
cerned,” he said, ‘‘and yet
they are not willing to spend
the least amount of time to
express this concern.”

He commented that the new
Student Government Associa-
tion should help relieve this
‘need for active involvement
by involving more people.

“It is important to start
now to relieve the problem,”
Terry concluded. ‘“‘We need
to begin with incoming fresh-
men and help channel their
interests, so that they don't
fall into a rut.”

Senior Tom Rhodes ac-
knowledged apathy on the
part of students in some is-
sues, but added that students
at Davidson are more unapa-
thetic about their own future
than many other college stu-
dents."

According to Rhodes, ‘‘the
Davidson student accepts a
lot of things without ques.
tion, mainly due to accept
ance of parental beliefs.’

He noted a two-part proc-
ess in the fulfillment of a lib
eral arts education, and the
necessity. of both parts for a
student to be complete, in-
cluding active involvement
in many issues.

“The first part,’’ Rhodes
said, “is a liberation from
dogmas of the home environ
ment, while the second is a
resynthesizing of personality

and beliefs."

“Davidson tends to spend
more time on the: second
part,’ he said, ‘‘and we need
to move more toward a total
experience, if we want to re
move the apathy from the

.Davidson student.”

Another senior, Geoff Sea-
mans, noted the school's role
in determining the amouni of
student involvement.

“The Davidson environment
tends to inhibit all involve-
ment,’’ Seamans commented.
‘The school tends to encour-
age the ability to compro.
mise in one's beliefs, and to
discourage any willingness to
proclaim openly any personal
cause.”

He added. ‘Davidson is
unlike most large schools.
where there are numerous
students ready to work for a
cause. At Davidson, the in-
dividual has to take the initi
ative to effect any cause or
interest."

Another reason, according
to Seamans, was the stu
dent’s “lack of knowledge of
what the faculty is doing:. he
gets rumors, but very few
facts about faculty deci.
sions.”

Several of the people who
expressed opinions comment.
ed that such a_ discussion
brought out more questions
than answers, but most of
them agreed that this discus
sion was one of extreme im
portance for all students,
which must be resolved by
the individuals.

Workman onoter. that this
type of discussion was a
nealthy sign, commenting
that “internal criticism of a
school is expressive of an in.
tense interest ir it.”

Radicals Seek To Rend
Fabric Of U.

By BOB REID
Managing Editor

To some members of the
new Left, student activism
means rending the entire
fabric of society.

While other student activ-
ists are primarily interested
‘in campus issues, the rad-
icals have turned their en-
ergies to more far-reaching
goals.

“We would like to see a
socialist society where the
needs of the overwhelming

number of people are met.

not just those of the rich."

This was the opinion of Jef-
frey Gordon, a member of
the New York-based Progres-
sive Labor Party (PLP),
which has- become the dar-
ling of the radical left.

The PLP maintains chap-
ters on campuses throughout
the country, but since the
party has been shadowed by
the FBI, the leadership is re-
luctant to release the size
and number of the chapters

Called Chinese oriented by
rival groups, the PLP con-
siders itself the vanguard of
a revolution which will sweep
away the capitalist system.

“Socialism in the United
States can only be obtained
by revolution,” Gordon said.
“The people who rule the so-
ciety repress attempts to
change society peacefully.”

Although the revolution-
aries will learn from the ex-
perience of foreign rebels.
the uprising will be led and
inspired by American lead-
ers, he said.

“What happens around the

world . affects us,’ he said,
“but the revolution must be
brought about internally. I
support actions in certain
countries, but the key thing
is that we have to develop
the type of system that will
best serve the people here."

The party considers itself
part of a worldwide revolu-
tionary movement, .Gordon
said, which includes the Na-
tional Liberation Front of
Vietnam and the Chinese
Communist Party. But Gor-
don was careful to maintain
that the PLP is not controlled
by a foreign influence.

Although he did not predict
the date of the revolution.
Gordon claimed that condi-
tions for uprising are rapid-
ly developing. ‘‘The urban
riots, Vietnam and the rising
consumer prices will all help
set up conditions for revolu-
tion.”

“The way a revolution de
velops is when the people
fight for their needs and they
realize the system cannot
give them what they want.
Then they decide on change."'

The political system after
the revolution will be one
based on popular will, he
said. Officials will be more
representative of the people's
will. They will not be cor-
rupt, and they will be sub-
ject to recall. Details of the
system will evolve from the
needs of the situation, he
said.

Although the revolution will
overthrow contemporary so-

ciety, the movement will not
be foreign oriented and will
draw on the traditions of
America for inspiration, he
said.

“There are a lot of great
things in the traditions of the
United States, such as the
abolitionist movement and
the struggles of the trade un-
ions. I would look for heroes
of these struggles for inspira-

tion."

But the PLP is definitely
internationalist, according to
Gordon. ‘We're a movement
based on struggles of the
American people but look to
the struggles of people all
over the world as united. We
are opposed to a_ system
which murders and oppress
es people all over the world
and at home.”

EX-STUDENT SAYS

(Staff Photos by Weems)

Cornell Is Large, Urbane

By DAVID SWEAT
Staff Writer

The student who enters Da
vidson from another college
quickly makes comparisons.
As a transfer from Cornell
University, .I have observed
some striking contrasts be-
tween the two schools.

The Davidson student is
markedly conservative by
comparison. The background
‘of the students provides part
of the answer. Cornell has
a distinctly eastern ethos.
White Anglo-Saxon protes-
tants do not form a majority
of the students.

Ghetto Negroes, urban
Jews, Oriental Americans.
and prep school graduates
give the campus a cosmopol
itan air.

Fifty - three fraternities
compete annually for pledg

es. Independent life is the.

choice of about one-third of
each class.

The fraternities have seen
the need to reform them
selves if they are to get the
top men in a student body
that has become increasing-
ly serious, even intellectual.
in recent. years. Overall, the
fraternities have come to

Student Demonstrations
Not Improper-Educator

GRAND FORKS, N.D. (IP)
—Student demonstrations are
not necessarily contrary to
the purposes of a university.
said Dr. Ronald E. Barnes.
vice president for student af
fair at the University of
North Dakota. Since the cam
pus is an academic commun-
ity which fosters exchange of
ideas, ‘‘We can be proud of
students who are concerned
enough about societal issues
to assert their views.'’ he
added.

His perspective on student
dissent was expressed in an
interview with the UND News
Bureau. Some questions and
answers follow:

Q. The news media of the
nation quite regularly carry
reports of “student unrest,”
“student activism,” ‘‘student
power."’ What is your gener-
al interpretation of these ac-
tivities on U.S. campuses?

A. My initial response is
that the reporting of the stu-
dent unrest not only exag-
gerates the situation in the
minds of the public but is an
inaccurate reflection of what
is happening on our campus-
es. Frankly, I wish more stu-
dents were questioning and
actively seeking to improve
the society in which they
live.

I believe the primary task
facing those of us within our
nation’s colleges and univer-
sities is to awaken students
who are indifferent to the ed-
ucational process, who are
content merely to acquire
useful skill training, and who
are complacently uninvolved
in learning.

Unfortunately, those of us
in higher education appar-
ently have not done a very
good job of communicating
to the public what higher ed-
ucation is about. The primary
task of a college or univer-

sity is not to train youth for
job slots. nor serve as na
tional resource centers, nor
to “contain” students until
society is ready to absorb
them into the job market.
The purpose of an institu
tion for higher learning is to
educate. This includes pre-
paring a person for a special
ized profession and the ac.
quisition of knowledge. but it
is’ more. It means, among
other things. that a student
should develop a critical at
titude of investigation. be
come capable of making in
dependent judgments, lib
erated from prejudice, and
excited about the adventure
of learning. In other words.

education should prepare one
to live fully and: meaningful-
ly apart from his vocation.

This means that a univer-
sity cannot avoid issues,
dodge questions, shy from
controversy or put safety be-
fore truth. The university
bases its existence on ideas.
their discovery and transmit
tal; and ideas are risky but
exciting.

Members of the faculty and
administration want our stu-
dents involved in this excite
ment, to question us. chal-
lenge us, examine and evalu
ate our ideas, criticize them.
and relate their thoughts and
their lives to ideas.

versity community.

This reversal of the anti
intellectual tradition in the
fraternities was boosted last
year by an experimental In.
terfaternity Council program
entitled “The Soul of Black
ness.”

The week long program
brought together on canipus
a Negro drama group, Negro
poets and historians, and Ne
gro art shows in a series of
programs which focused on
the cultural tradition on the
American Negro.

This year the topic for
the IFC week is ‘Election:
1968°'. Several prominent na
tional political figures will ap
pear on that program sched-
uled for next week at Cor:
nell,

Cornell. like Davidson, is
run by policy made by fac-
ulty committees. In recent
years students have been
named as voting members of
some of these committees.

But more effective than
Students on the committees
has béen the persistent work
of students appearing before
faculty committee meetings
for months about particular
policy changes.

Last year by this process
the Freshman Class Council
gained approval of driving
privileges for second semes
ter freshman—a_ prohibition
dating from the end of World
War II.

Open house rules which al
low women in the dormito
ries were liberalized. New
open house hours are longer.
and a more realistic policy
allows more privacy than un
der the old rules.

Last fall the Freshman
Class Council finally won fac
ulty approval for a change in
dormitory liquor policy. Rules
which prohibited alcoholic
beverages in thg: freshman
dormitories were repealed.

Student administration con
frontations are frequent at
Cornell. Crises were precipi.
tated last year by campus
marijuana arrests, military
recruiters on campus, and by
the illegal seizure of a stu-
dent publication by campus
police on obscenity charges.
High prices and poor food

brought a student boycott of
university cafeterias.

The Vietnam War continues
to be the primary student
concern at Cornell. The Stu-
dent Council last year spon-
sored a convention: on Viet-
nam which drew representa
tives from scores of eastern
schools. °

The March on Washington
last fall numbered one to
two thousand Cornellians in
its crowd. The New York
City demonstration in the
spring of 1967 drew almost as
many.

Numbers of students have
fasted this year in protest to
the war. An around-the-clock
peace vigil endured several
weeks of the harsh New York
winter in the last weeks be
fore Christmas.

Faculty members.and cam
pus clergy are helping to
support a printing office
available for use by groups
who have liberal causes to
publicize.

A protest newspaper is
published regularly. Almost
daily, protest literature is
handed to students on the

steps of the Student Union.

Firm individual commit
ment is the basis for most
of this student activism. And
although the American peo-
ple seem generally to ascribe
Vietnam protests to “‘those
dirty hippies." at Cornell
protest comes from all seg-
ments of the student popula-
tion.

A student population in ex-
cess of 15.000 makes Cornell
a bureaucratic, inflexible in-
stitution in many ways.

Yet with classes as large
as 500 students, make-up ex
ams are scheduled by the
professors in consultation
with the students. The idea
behind this. policy, apparent
ly. is that such matters are .
the concern only of the stu-
dent and his teacher. Rigid
policy could only hinder the
procedure,

SDS Is Involved

In Broad Issues

Unlike some activist
groups, the Students for a
Democratic Society tries to
involve itself in both campus
and national issues.

**We try to interest students
in gaining influence over the
mechanism for change."’ said
Miss Marilyn MacNabb, field
organizer for the left-wing
haven of the upper middle
class. ‘We are especially in
terested in changes that in
volve the federal govern-
ment.”

Miss MacNabb said the SDS
does not ordinarily involve it-
self in local campus politics,
Nor does it usually take ac
tion in lesser issues such as
dormitory hours and drink
ing rules.

But in issues of broader
significance, the SDS takes
an active role. ‘‘For instance,
she said, ‘‘some of the col
leges in the D.C. area have
been involved in germ war
fare research. Studnts have
no voice in whether or not

they want this sort of thing.”'

“If the university exists to
serve and train the students.
then it needs to be sensitive
to what students want.’ Stu
dents should have a share in
determining what type of ac-
ademic community they want
to live in.”

Draft resistance has be.
come one of the chief SDS
goals, she added. SDS is op
posed to the Vietnam War,
and the members feel that
draft resistance offers the
most effective means of pro-
test, she said.

SDS uses several avenues
of resistance, she said, in
cluding distributing informa-
tion on legal alternatives to
conscription. Refusing induc-
tion is the last resort. she
added.

Finances and membership
are the major problems of
SDS, she said. ‘‘You're lucky
you called early because our
phone is being repossessed
today,’ she quipped.

NSA Finds Place Among Students

After floundering for a year
in search of a new identity.
the National Student Associa-
tion has discovered a place
for itself in American stu-
dent life.

From its headquarters in
Washington, D. C., NSA ad-
vises student activists
throughout the country on
ways to implement campus
reforms.

Long associated with Siber-
al ideals, NSA is still hawk-
ing progressive policies, such
as black power and a U.S.
withdrawal from Vietnam.
But under the leadership of
President Ed Schwartz, NSA
has become the spokesman
for moderate student activ-
ism.

“We do not encourage stu-
dent strikes as a matter of
principle,” Schwartz said
with a whisper of a Northern
accent. ‘“‘Nor do we encour-
age hanging the dean in ef-

figy every time students

don't get their way.”

But Schwartz's philosophy
does not rule out strikes as a
means to gain reform. At the
University of California at
Berkeley, Schwartz advised
student leaders to join with
the radicals in calling for a
student strike.

“If there are no. other
means available to institute
reform, then we encourage
strikes. Our policy is very
flexible.”

NSA’s policies are so flex-
ible that some radicals have
charged that the organization
has no policy at all, except
to gain the maximum amount
of publicity. Many of these
radicals became disenchant-
ed with NSA following the
CIA scandal last year and
with the convention held that
following summer.

it was @ year ago fast week

that Ramparts Magazine
broke the story that the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency had
been funding NSA in return
for information on foreign
student leaders.

The announcement rocked
the organization so much that
some observers gave it only
a few months to live. More
liberal supporters denounced
NSA and predicted an exodus
of member student govern-
ments,

But the prophecy was nev-
er fulfilled. Some schools,
such as Brandeis University,
left the association, but most
stayed on. Several new
schools have since joined,
offsetting the defections and
raising the number of mem-
bers from 285 to 335.

But some leftists who
weathered the CIA crisis
could not stand the climate
at the July convention in Col-

lege Park, Md. With the vic-
tory of Schwartz over Sam
Brown for the presidency,
the moderates gained control
of the NSA leadership.

NSA seems to have surviv:
ed the defection of liberals,
but the loss of CIA funds has
presented a more challenging
problem, Schwartz said. The
organization is going through
a crucial period now,
Schwartz said, but officials
are optimistic that funds will
be coming soon.

“We still do not have suf-
ficient resources to provide
the services we'd like to,”
Schwartz said. ‘We're build-
ing and this will take time.
But a few things are devel-
oping."

Those ‘‘few things’ include
low cost life insurance, char-
ter flights to Europe and a
national student record club.
Fees from some of these

services will form the bulk
of NSA's revenue, Schwartz
said, along with dues from
member student govern.
ments. Schwartz said he
hopes to have the association
solvent by January 1969.

In the field of student pow-
er, NSA publishes literature
on the legal rights of stu.
dents in matters pertaining
to control by administration.
Several staff members are
available to advise student.
leaders on their rights in
matters of college discipline.
Schwartz said.

NSA is now pleading with
administrations to adopt
more lenient policies in re-
gard to punishing marijuana
smokers. According to
Schwartz, NSA wants admin-
istrations to refrain from
turning student violators over
to civil authorities as a mat-
ter of policy.
