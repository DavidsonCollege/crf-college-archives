Rural Sunday Schools
Are Being Reorganized

Good Crowds Out for First Services of
Spring Term.

Last Sunday twenty-two Davidson|
men went vut into the country on Sun-
day School work. “Uhis was the first
time that the influenza situation has per-
mitted the schools to be conducted. but
with a continuation of the recent excel-
Vent weather there should’ be no relapse
-in the situation,

Despite the fact that this was the
first Sunday at most of the schools, the
total attendance was two hundred and
nineteen—which was very encouraging.
At each place the peaple seemed glad to
have college men back to lead them. In-
deed, statistics om attendance prove that
Davidson men always bring an increase
in attendance. ‘This appreciation on the,
pare ot the people fully repays’ the men
for the -inconveniences caused them by
giving their afternoon to the work. |

While the corps of teachers is full and
overflawing at present. later when the
schools get into’ their running stridd
there will be need of more men." 1 you
are interested tell E.G. Lilly or Emery
Flinn.
