WILDCAT TRACKS

Following Davidson’s
“MEN OF MIGHT”
Along the Athletic Trail

“

By Zeb Long, Jr.

The Wildcats are in the midst of one of
the best winning streaks that has been seen
around these diggings for several years, Evi-
dently “Doctor Charlie” has been burying his
ancient and far-famed rabbit foot around
first base, and as a result the team has been
hitting like demons, fielding like big-leaguers,
and the pitchers look better than ever before.
If that old cotton-tail limb wins ball games,
why, get a bushel or so of them, Charlie!

Four slashing victories over Oglethorpe
and Lynchburg constituted the week’s pro-
gram for the varsity. McInnis again stepped
in to win two of these games, while Kugler
and Meadows showed form to copy the two
remaining. “Smiling Joe” Meadows justi-
fied the faith of the boys from the East
when he turned in his first win of the season.
He twirled a nice game, though hit rather
freely, and outdid tradition by driving out
a long three-bagger.

There is no doubt that Davidson boasts
one of the strongest college outfields in the
South. Ratchford, Johnson and McConnell
form a trio that guard the outer gardens to
perfection. Johnson came through with some
of the most sensational catches ever seen
here, in the second game with the Petrels.
He accepted ten chances and made them all
good. The stands gave Hal a big hand as
he trotted in after a seemingly impossible
catch of a low liner. Byrd, of Lynchburg,
also joined the circle of the mighty by pull-
ing down a couple of smacks that had all
the earmarks of triples.

Mattox’s Wildkittens broke their tie with
Wingate Junior College in nice style, “Lefty”

Younger’s Men Win Four

Virginia Trip is Most Successful in|

Several Years |

Davidson Wildcats invaded Virginia on

April 2nd in their first trip of the season to|
win from Guilford College, two games from |
Lynchburg: College, and one from V. P. I.
All the contests were close and well played |
although the boys at Lynchburg put*up the
strongest opposition. McInnis was. called
| upon twice by Coach Monk to do the twirl-
ing and each time handed back a victory.
| Meeting Guilford on the way to Virginia,
| the Wildcats received a good start by taking
| them in camp to the tune of 6 to 0. Doc
Kugler held the Quakers at his mercy
throughout the whole game, allowing only
‘five scattered hits, while his teammates
bunched their six hits when needed.

Coach Monk let his loose against Lynch-
burg College on April 3rd for the first game
of the series to win 4 to 2, Although outhit
by Lynchburg, the ’Cats bunched their hits
in the eighth inning to cinch the game. Mc-

, Innis kept the Virginia hits well scattered
|and in places where they didn’t count.

| The second game, with. Doc Heriderson
pitching, was a close call, ending 2to 1. Two
hits in the eighth inning were made good for
the only two runs Davidson made and proved
to be the final scoring for both teams: Lynch-
burg made two safe blows count for their
only run in the second inning.

Davidson College Wildcats added their
third and fourth victories of the week when
they defeated the Lynchburg College Hor-
nets by the decisive scores of 9 to 4 and 13
to 3. Johnson played in both glames like a
major leaguer.

Both teams played good games and trounc-
ed on the ball without mercy. In the first
game on Wednesday, the 18th, the ’Cats
bunched 13 safeties to tally 9 runs; the dozen
bingles of the Hornets were kept scattered.
The Davidson boys scored five runs in the
first inning, enough to win the game, when
Bell was wild, giving five free passes com-
bined with an error and two hits. ey

Johnson, playing deep in center during the
Wednesday game, made a beautiful  shoe-
string catch in the sixth inning, robbing the
Lynchburg batter of an extra hit. He also
swung a wicked stick in the Thursday game
by poling out a triple and two singles out of
three trips to the bat.

Byrd, Hornet centerfielder, showed his
ability to pull in the flies when he snatched
two out of the air for beautiful catches in
the Thursday game.

The unlucky number 13 featured the final
game with Lynchburg, but it happened to be
an ill omen to the crew from Virginia. Hit-
ting the ball in every direction, the ’Cats
garnered 13 hits off of Grant, and when the
score was added it was found to tally exactly
13. This was the fourth time this year the

Davidson team defeated Lynchburg College.

nings. His, offering was received by the
Institute boys in fine style, but they couldn't
decide what to do with it. McConnel car-
ried off the batting honors with two hits out
of three times up.

A game was scheduled with Roanoke Col-
lege on April 5th, but was called off owing
to the bad condition of the athletic field,
which is being worked on. It was reported
also that a number of the college team had
been conditioned on account of their studies
and would not be allowed to play. Neverthe-
less the trip into Virginia was by far the
most’ successful in many years; four wins
out of four starts.
