THURSDAY, APRIL 11,

REAL BUSINESS
As the days draw near when
cap and gown will dominate the
walks of the campus, when
speeches and presentations will
be the order of the hour, when
friends and relatives will throng

the college grounds, the minds of l

college men turn to more serious
speculation than usual. Com-
mencement is a wonderful occa-
sion, both to the participant and
to the onlooker, and to each it
offers food for serious thought.
More than any other time of the
year it seems to speak of “real
business.”

Seniors, rushing about in the
mad effort to wind up their af-
fairs, stop once in a while to won-
der what it is going to be like
away from the sound of David-
son’s bell, and out of her shelter-
ing walls. They know that a task
of great proportions awaits them,
and that people will be ever on the

alert to sensure or commend their
actions in the world of business or

profession. Gratification
of achievement and regret of lost
opportunity vie with each other
for top place in the training of
thought. But above all the spirit
of determination engages the out-
going Senior and turns his pow-
ers along the high road to suc-
cess. He must make this thing of
life a “real business’—a real ac-
complishment which will justify
the years of training, and which
will entitle him to a secure place
in the regard of family, friends
and teachers. Yes, it’s a real bus-
iness.- which beckons to the
fourth year man.

And then, naturally, Commen-
cement bring serious thoughts to
the onlookers, the under-class-
men. Desire to gain the point in
college rating won by the Senior
is instilled into the men who re-
main, or, on the other hand, there
may come a realization of things
undone and a subsequent hope to
surpass the older men, Finally,
the sad truth of ways parting and
personal contacts lost comes into
the picture. Probably this is the
thing which gives Commence-
ment its almost sacred air. Well
do we remember seeing promi-
nent Seniors leave on the last day
as quickly as possible, neglecting
to speak to many old friends, sim-
ply because as they said, “I can’t
stand to tell Jim good-bye”—
keeping a happy memory of days
together unmarred by a farewell
which might be the last. Yes, it’s
“real business” any way you look
at it. |

THE STATE-MEET. ~~: "*

In a week or so athletes from
every college in North Carolina
will be flocking to Greensboro
and the Memorial Stadium where

‘

the annual State Track Meet will
be held. Davidson’s best bets will
be in evidence on that day as will
a good number of Davidson stu-
dents tg witness the festivities.
It should be so, we think. There
is nothing so helpful in upholding
the reputation of a school as a
student body which is sure to be

on hand when the teams are on
the testing block.

_As usual, Carolina and Duke
will more than likely lead the

field in entries. In years past, the
Tar Heels have far surpassed
their competitors in men quali-
fied, and as a result have walked
off with the title most of the
time. Such a condition makes it

‘|very hard for a college the size

of Davidson to make a creditable
showing. Yet, the Wildcats have
never failed to win some of the
most coveted places and some of
the higfiest awards. Lacking a
well-rounded track team, David-

son has boasted men in the dashes
who knew no equal, and this year

will be no exception to that rule.
A good many points are due to
fall behind the flying. feet of Cur-
rie, Whittle, and the rest of the
speedsters.

The thing to think about, how-
ever is the prospect for the fu-
ture, and we cannot help but be-
lieve that Davidson is on the
verge of a new day, not only in
track exploits, but in every
branch of athletic activity. We
ong for the time when a state
meet or a title race of gridiron,
diamond, or court will mean at
least an equal chance for the
Red and Black. That day seems
to be coming, slowly, perhaps, but
surely, Interest is being aroused
in every quarter of afta actos
in regard to the athletics! of the
college. It seems certain that
definite action will be taken to
boost thé present condition.

Soon we may hope for the state
meet to mean more than just a
chance for winning two or three
places. Davidson is coming into
her own. Go over and watch the
Wildcats next. week. They are
going to bring honor to the col-
lege. Don’t think that the Cats
can win the meet—we won't qual-
ify enough men to win, but those
who do get in are sure to be the
class of the day.

It’s great to bring a bunch of
athletes together of the high type
which will be in evidence at
Greensboro. The nation can boast

of no finer lot. The keeeness of
competition is in no wise lessened

by the fact that two or three
schools enter a majority of the
contestants. Manhood is devel-
oped and college spirit is seared

deep into the hearts of loyal sons
at a state meet. There’s a glam-

our and a glory there.

ally known criminal lawyer of
Loeb and Leopold fame, should
make the statement to a Nebras-
kan reporter, “If you are a poor
student, don’t study law and the
other professions because the rich
students are the only ones that
have a chance in these fields,” was
both a shock and disappointment,
and was greeted with about the
same enthusiasm and welcome as
a garter snake in a box of corn
flakes.

This bit of fatherly advice in a
college town, to a representative
of a college paper, where most of

the students do not happen to. be

in a sewing bee, at least it could
not cause more consternation and

Cosmic Chaos
By J. W. McCutchan

Various Senators and Congressmen
still attack, and bitterly, the personal)
opinions of their fellow officials. Espec-
ially do they attack one another on the
grounds of religion and prohibition. A
religious argument is a bad one to start
for several reasons. Arguments have been
known to grow into wars, and religious
wats are the most terrible .of.the species.
One only has to recall the struggles in
Europe which centered about the mas-
sacre of St. Bartholomew's Day. To il-
lustrate this, an Arab may appear dor-
mant, lazy, indolent, but place him in a
fight against the “dogs of unbelievers”
and there was never a more enthusiastic
fanatic.

But at that, our representatives in the

legislative halls of the nation receive
rather large pay for the privilege of ma-
ligning one anothers’ character for per-
sonal reasons. It is true that the “bloody
times” of Jim Reed, and Henry Cabot
Lodge, have gone, but they will never be
forgotten. Perhaps Heflin and Blease will
take their places with ardor.
It is generally admitted that General
Maxime Weygand, formerly First Aide
to Marshal Foch, will assume the baton
of the Marshal of France, the greatest
military honor which that country can
offer. He steps to a position which has
long been filled by the most illustrious,
tactical leaders of all time. Generel Pe-
tain, and—‘‘Pappa” Joffre-were-given-the
honorary title during the World War.
But look farther back to the days of
Napoleon, Ney and others. There were
men who spread the glory of the fleur-
de-lis until. it encompassed Continental
Europe. Even D’Artagnan was offered
the baton in “The Man of the Iron
Mask.”’ Oh, well, give us a few Legion
of Honors, and Croix de Guerres, s'il
vous plait.

“D. A. R. Election is Chief Topic at
Washington” proved to be a rather start-
ling headline the other day, in lieu of the
fact that the building there was once
pointed out to a visitor of the capital as
being the scene of more bloodshed than
took place in the entire Revolution. Per-
haps it was a poor pun on a worthy or-
ganization, but the fact remains that with
its present system of requirements for
membership its exclusiveness will aot be
maintained. In a couple of hundreds .of
years, most anyone will be able to join
through one of her forty-seven thousand
and some odd hundred great to the nth
power grandparents,

News comes from Staunton) Va.,S that
furniture workers have gone on a strike,
following the example set by textile
laborers. Red agitators should be effect-
ively disposed of as was Eugene Debs,
who perhaps is the only man who was
ever nominated for President while
serving a term in the Federal Penitent-
iary. But what may we ask, will the
striking textile workers sit on, if the fur-

niture business ‘“faws down and goes
boom ?”

Despite rather regular cries of the ex-
pedition of English justice, and despite
regular deplorement of American effici-
ency, ‘the fact remains that justice gen-
erally has its way. There were many
who were aghast when Leopold and Loeb
were committed to the insane asylum
They are still there. Hickman, most re-
pulsive of humans, met his fate after a
sensational fight by a young lawyer. To
cap the climax it has been ruled by su-
preme court that Harry F. Sinclair, oil
magnate, must serve his ninety days. in
jail. Money may not mean everything
after all but we bet that he gets his
“two fors” every day.

Menacing murmurings come from the
Charlotte News. So there is a Commun-
ist Club here is there? Well-I-1, (as
Uncle Josh Billings would say) we'd like
to meet yer. In accordance with sup-

If it were true that only rich
students had a chance of making
‘a success in a profession, then the
country would be wasting thou-
sands of dollars in the mainte-
nance of niedical and law schools,
because rich students could afford

to go to private institutions.
Fortunately, Mr. Darrow’s ad-

vice, though probably given with
the best of intentions, will not be

followed because it sounds like
the philosophy of a pessimist. As
products of*the twentieth cen-
tury, young people prefer to point
with pride to Lincoln, Hoover and
other famous American person-
ages who have succeeded in spite
of the fact that they did not start
out rich—Daily | Nebraskan.

It is announced that the cost of Federal
Prohibition Enforcement in terms of
human life is 190 dead from violent causes
in nine years. Of these 55 were Federal
agents and 135 suspected law violators.
These figures do not include those killed
in State enforcement. The policy of
shooting to enferce the prohibition . law
has been severely criticized on the
grounds that it is too drastic, but it
seems that if we are to have any enforce-
ment at all, drastic measures must , be
taken.

Cal Coolidge and Al Smith are now in
civilian competition. Coolidge was re-

Uncle Sam has taken steps to see that
the Mexican War doesn’t stray over

been given to the 18 American Army
planes patrolling the border in the vicini-

can planes which fly over U. S. territory.

The S. S. Leviathan recently passed to
private ownership when it was sold for
$4,000,000. The new management expects
to keep an open bar on all trips when
outside the 12-mile limit. The reason for
this is because it brings an increased
business to the ship.

Canada doesn’t seem to appreciate the
high-handed attitude of the U. S. Radio

There have been complaints that the

A tiew victim has been chosen, or rather sucked in, to be sacrificed on the

altar of the great god, Bull.

The crime was ‘committed in this way. It was

one of those beautiful spring days which occur between our rainy seasons, so
I was strolling across the campus, enjoying nature and beaming on all man-
kind. Suddenly, who should show up but our well known editor. He had a nasty

look in his eye, and I was sore afraid.

However, I continued on to meet my

fate. “Hael!” sez he. “Waes hael!” I snap back, showing him that I know the

old Anglo-Saxon custom. “You're just about to ‘write a column,” sez he. “Sir!”
sez I, and about that time I sold out. Well, to make a long, sad story short, when

they called the cops, I’d promised to write this mess.

This all goes to show

| Contemporary Thought

COLLEGIATE, COLLEGIATE

The raucous jazz notes of “Colle-
giate, Collegiate, yes we are collegiate”
have penetrated the awful and silent
depts of the dean’s office. It is not a
welcome tune, and something ought
to be done about it. So at the next
convention of deans in April the words
will be revised to read “Yes, but are
we collegiate?”

Something may eventually be done
about it. In the meantime, a question-
naire. Dean Henry Grattan Doyle of
George Washington University has
sent one to four hundred deans. He
asks, among many questions:

Is neatness in appearance, as evi-
denced by clean shaving, well-shined
shoes, starched linen, appropriate
neckties of neat appearance and well-
pressed suits of clothing, typical of
your student body?. or,

In the main, does the psychological
attitude of your student body approve
of slouchy and careless habits of dress
and conduct or neat habits of dress
and courteous manners?

It does not require a very keen mind
to predict what the answer to that will
be. Already the reassuring replies are
coming back. From Wesleyan:

“The present generation of students
here, as I look upon them, are well-
dressed, well-behaved, a very different
type from what we had twenty-five
years ago...,

“Speaking in general of the morals
of the community, I feel perfectly sure
that they are on a higher plane than
they have ever been... .”

We have a pretty strong conviction
that Dean Doyle will be able to re-
port at the convention that on the
word of 390 deans this generation is
the best yet. (The one exception will
be Harvard, which has already re-
fused to answer the questions.)

But aren't the deans waking up to
the collegiate menace two or three
years late? Collegiatism is dying out
in the colleges, though it will linger on
in remote colleges, in front of drug-
stores, and on vaudeville platforms for
a long while. There is something of
romatic excess in the collegiate cos-
tume that is out of key with these
Prosaic times. _ Bell-bottom trousers,
un-anchored socks and such-like are
as much relics of the past as is the

fashion of carrying the American
Mercury. (They read The New York-
er now). :

The fearful dean: should read any
“What Young Men Are Wearing”
column in the magazines that cater
to college youth. There college men
are being told that a neat conserva-
tive appearance is a “valuable asset”
and that “anyone in the business world
who hopes to make good”is lost with-
out it.” The greater. manufacturers
depict in full-page ads the terrible
tragedies that befall those who have

no “Sox Appeal” and the Arrow col-

lar people are out gunning for the in-
formal roll-collared shirt of the out-

of-style “drugstore cowboy.” ‘Even
the coonskin coat is passing.

Other times, other manners. The
collegiate mode is passing out. The

reason it is going is the reason why all
fashions change. The hoi polloi, drug
clerks and farm hands, have caught
up with it. The next job for college
men is to create a new fashion. Other-
wise the four years would be wasted,
and there would be no way to distin-
guish between those who have had the
Privilege of a college education and
those who have not.

POUND’S PLAN

Appalling as is the amount of time
wasted by unessential or unorganized
reading in college to help the student
find an ordered plan in the mighty
maze of literature. Ezra Pound in a
recent issue of “Books” of the New
York Herald-Tribune gives the stu-
dents the benefit of his own experi-
ence in reading.

“Literary instruction in our insti-
tutions of learning’ was at the be-
ginning of this century, cumbrous and
inefficients. I dare say it still is. Cer-
tain more or less mildly exceptional
Professors were affected by the ‘beau-
ties’ of» various authors (usually de-
ceased) but the system, as a whole,
lacked sense and co-ordination, I dare.
Say it still does. But when studying
physics we are not asked to investi-
gate the biographies of all the dis-
ciples of Newton who showed inter-
est in science, but who failed to make
any discovery. Neither their unre-
warded gropings, hopes, Passions,
laundry bills or erotic experiences are
thrust on the hurried student or con-
sidered germane to the subject.”

Mr. Pound would have the student
read those books which make some
epochal contribution to literature. He
says:

“And we could, presumably, apply
to the study of literature a little of
the commonsense that we currently
apply to physics or to biology. In
Poetry there are simple Procedures,
and there are known discoveries, clear-
ly marked. As I have said in various
places in my as yet unorganized and
fragmentary volumes: in each lage
One or two men of genius find some-
thing, and» express it. It may be in
only a line or in two lines, or in some
quality of a cadence; and thereafter
two dozen, or two hundred, or two
or more thousand followers repeat ,
and delute and modify.

“And if |the instructor would select
his specimens from works that con-
tain these discoveries and solely on
the basis of discovery—which may
lie in the dimension of depth, not mere-
ly of some novelty on the surface—he
would aid his student far more than
by presenting his authors at random,

and talking about them in tot.”
