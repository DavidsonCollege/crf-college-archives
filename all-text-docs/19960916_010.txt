“If you like pina coladas, if you have
half a brain. . . “ blasted from a golf cart
strategically positioned in front of Cham-
bers lawn as students hurried to make it to
their 12:30 classes on time after lunch. The
students who changed their paths and walked
to the left of the bike rack escaped unnoticed
and unharmed into Chambers. Those who
walked directly in front of the cart were
ambushed by scary upperclassmen dressed

in’ funny clothes wielding colorful plastic -

leis.

Later in the afternoon, three freshmen
girls on their way to the post office were
almost taken out by the golf cart as it ca-
reened over the grass and came to a screech-
ing halt in front of them. .

The driver of the cart jumped out cack-
ling madly with three of the plastic torture
devices in his hand. “I don’t want one,
please, I really don’t,” the braver of the three
asserted even as she cowered behind her
friends. “Take them, freshmen, it’s not like
you have to pay for them,” the over-excited
fraternity member shouted. “Ah, ha ha ha
ha! And be at the Lunar Luau tonight. On

Richardson Field.”

The three students followed the decree
of the wise upperclassman and made their
way over to the Luau beneath the lights on
Richardson Field later that night. Tables of
free cotton candy, sno-cones, pizza and bar-
b-que called to them from the edge of the
track. A little further beyond crafty students
made tie-dye shirts, challenging other to
win them by throwing a ball and knocking
over a pyramid of coke cans.

The girls stopped a long time to watch
the next booth. Three kamikaze Sigma Phi

Epsilons scurried after a Coke box. Students
and members of the Davidson community
armed with paint pellet guns let go of re-
pressed anger by pelting the boys with or-
ange paint before they reached the box to
carry it back to their base.

A number of combat stations graced the
area around Richardson Field, inviting par-
ticipants to beat each others’ brains out with

- large mallets or boxing gloves in true Ameri-

can Gladiator style.
One game called the “Moonwalk”
looked more like exercise to the girls, so

they passed it up in favor of a friendly game
of “Twister,” which turned unfriendly when
a hot-headed contestant accused the caller
of trying to sabotage the spirit of-the game
by calling “left foot, yellow” three time ina
row.

The girls finally decided to call it a
night after watching a group of guys play a
game of ultimate frisbee in the center of the
field. Snug and warm in their beds, the girls
drifted off to sleep with the memories of
what fabulous fun can be had at an “up the
hill” event dancing in their heads.

Oh, the fun of 21 ...

Tuesday, September 10 marked the first 21-year-old night in.the 900
Room this year. As birthdates would have it, the room was full of
seniors. This gave students stressed about future plans and career
center meetings a time to relax together ... just like freshman year.
