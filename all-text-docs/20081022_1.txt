If you discovered you could
change the past, would you?

Davidson theatre department’s
latest production scheduled to be
performed during Family Week-
end, “Communicating Doors,”

addresses that question with fast-
paced wit and flair that leaves the
audience with one unanimous an-
swer: absolutely.

This wild British farce, written
by Alan Ayckbourn, opens with a

tempts to escape for her life, and
accidentally discovers a hotel door
that connects her with the past, thus
arming her with enough informa-
tion to stop the two murders from
occurring in the future.

With the help of Reese’s second
wife, an honest, upright woman
named Ruella Wells (Kim Mur-
phy ’09) Poopay must quickly race
between the span of forty years
through this “communicating” ho-
tel door to prevent these murders,
including Ruella’s own tragic fate.

Former Artistic Director of the
Charlotte Repertory Theatre, Steve
Umberger, directs this play for the
second time with an all-star cast
of Davidson junior and senior stu-
dents.

“It’s been a lot of fun,” Mario
Silva 09, who plays the semi-
clueless security detective at Wells’
hotel, said. “Probably the most fun
I’ve ever had in a play. We’ve all
known each other for three years;
we’ve all done shows together. Ev-
erybody is so good. And Steve’s
been great.”

Umberger himself is no strang-
er to Davidson. He has been direct-
ing performances on and off since

Wireless network expands coverage

ALEX KowaLeskl
Staff Writer

In the last 14 months, Davidson
College’s Information Technology
Services (ITS) has implemented
several improvements to make
wireless internet access more wide-
spread and user friendly.

These changes included an up-
grade in the bandwidth, the deploy-
ment of new wireless access points
and the expansion of wireless ac-
cess across campus, including the
student lounge in Davidson Col-
lege Presbyterian Church.

According to Mur Muchane,
Executive Director of Information
Technology Services, over the sum-
mer ITS split the wireless network
into separate networks — Wildcat-
Net for student-owned computers
and DavidsonSecure for College-
owned computers.

According to Muchane, the goal
of this change was to increase se-
pall to protect those who use the

network to conduct sensitive trans-
actions, such as online banking.
However, some students who
came back to campus early in Au-
gust noted that the new network,
WildcatNet, was a bit cumbersome
to join.

For this reason, ITS has decid-
ed to do away with WildcatNet by
October 27 and replace it with Da-
vidsonSecure, a new network that
Muchane describes as—‘easier to
use because it allows all computers

Town planners seek input

ANDREW EvANs
Staff Writer

The Town of Davidson is mov-
ing forward with the creation of its
Comprehensive Plan, according
to town communications director
Sara-Lynne Levine, and the next
step for the town is getting people
on board for study groups.

A “study group” is a group
of about ten town citizens—cit-
izenship is the only prerequisite
for membership—who will spend
the next 18-24 months discussing
and holding public town meetings
about a certain subject “umbrella,”
Levine said.

These subject umbrellas are, ac-
cording to the Town of Davidson’s
website: environmental sustain-
ability, mobility, economic devel-
opment, growth management, local
governance, community character
and community development.

“These study groups are the
backbone of public input for the
Comprehensive Plan,’ Lauren
Blackburn, a town planner, said.

Public input is nothing new to
the town, indicated Connie Wess-
ner, a member of the town’s Plan-
ning Board. The Planning Board
itself provides for citizen input in

new town development by repre-
senting a cross-section of town res-
idents from a wide range of neigh-
borhoods and backgrounds. Wess-
ner said that there is a constructive
relationship between elected offi-
cials, town staff and citizens, and
Davidson is “unusual in its ability
to foster those ties.”

Davidson has a diverse citizen
makeup, and citizens bring these
differences to town discussions.
Wessner said that no one group
of citizens takes the lead in town-
wide initiatives, but instead the
town likes to foster an in-depth dia-
logue.

This is “the way Davidson
tends to do business,’ Wessner
said. “[The] Comprehensive Plan
is a good reflection of that.”

The purpose of the Plan is to
“develop and document consensus
on the values that should guide
growth” Wessner said. And this
plan will not work unless there is
a strong general consensus about
what these values are.

This is where the study groups
become involved. The study groups
will determine citizen values and at-
titudes toward the aforementioned
