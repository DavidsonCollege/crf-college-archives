FRIDAY EVENING

Paul Sabin And Patricia Gail Are
Featured In Approaching
Festivities —
VALENTINE MOTIF USED

Council Arranges Decorations For
Coming Dance Set

At nine-thirty Friday evening David-
son’s Mid-Winter dances will begin to
the strains of Paul Sabin’s orchestra
and the melodic voice of Patricia Gail,
torch singer. The Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil has compléted plans for what they
hope will be the most enjoyable dance
set of the year.

All three dafices will be held in the
Charlotte Armory. The Friday night
formal dance, lasting until 2 A. M.,,
will be one of the most colorful events
on Davidson's social calendar. Special
Valentine decorations have been ar-
ranged for the occasion at considerable
expense by the Council. Paul Sabin has
also wired the Council that he has pre-
pared several novelties to aid in ef-
fectively carrying out the decorative
scheme,

As has been the custom in the past,
the members of the Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil will form a figure during the Friday
night dance. The figure this year has
been arranged by a noted dance instruc-
tor in Charlotte. The following mem-
bers of the Council and their dates will
be in the figure: Mims Rogers, ‘Joe
Wadsworth, Bill Atwater, Fred McPhail,
Duke Glasgow, Charley Harris, Hugh
Yelverton, W. B. Ravenel, and A. C.
Rogers. The figure will also include an
additional representative from each fra-
ternity with their dates.

The Saturday tea dance will begin at
at five-thirty and last until seven, and
the night dance will last from 8:30 to
12. Both of thesé dances will be in-
formal. Novelties and other additional
features have been arranged for these
affairs.

Practically every fraternity on the
campus is planning a party or banquet
to add to the revelry of the occasion.
Comment among the students seems to
point to the fact that all are looking
forward to a gala week-end and many
are inviting dates up to share in the
festivities. .

In addition to Patricia Gail, Bob, Car-
ter and Paul Sabin make up a well bal-
anced vocal team. Carter was formerly
with Paul Whiteman with whom he
gained recognition for his vocal talent.
Paul Sabin plays the banjo and guitar
when not directing his bandsmen.

New Professor Takes
Over Minault’s Duties

Professor Robert G. Bailey has taken
over the classes in French which Pro-
fessor Minault was forced to give up
due to his recent illness.

Bailey will continue in his present ca-
pacity for the remainder of the year.

Professor Bailey took his A.B. and
M. A. work at Wesleyan University at
Middleton, Conn., and then took addi-
tional graduate work at Princeton Uni-
versity. Last year was’ his first year of
teaching when he taught at Massenutten

Professor Bailey’s chief impression of
the South thus far has been the warm-
ness of the weather, it happened that
he left the North during a cold spell and
arrived here during the recent warm
spell so that he received a very favorable
impression of southern weather.

PETITION TO TRUSTEES

To the Trustees of Davidson College
in meeting assembled this twentieth day
of February, 1935, this petition is re-
spectfully submitted.

Petitioning body: the Student Policies
Union (composed of 80 per cent of the
upperclasses of the student body of
Davidson College).

Subject: A request for the suspension
of the present dancing prohibitions and a
trial period of dancing on the Davidson
College campus under the supervision of
any authority the Board of Trustees may
deem fit to appoint.

In order to avoid any misapprehension
the petitioning body wishes in the outset
to explain its nature.

For many scholastic generations there
has been a prevalent sentiment among
Davidson students concerning dancing on
the campus; this sentiment,has at several
periods broken out in rather violent and
incendiary agitations for dancing on the
campus. In contradistinction, the body
which calls itself the Student Policies
Union has sprung up in order to organize
current student sentiment, and bend this
sentiment into reasonable channels de-
void of rebellions or childishly excita-
tive characteristics.

The members of the Student Policies
Union originally united themselves by be-
ing co-signers to an article expressing
a general dissatisfaction with existing so-
cial conditions on the campus. After
formal organization we have been able
(we think, and hope), to formulate more
reasonable and more specific opinions
than those which at first brought us to-
gether.

The Student Policies Union believes
that a definitely necessary part of edu-
cation at Davidson should be a gentle-
manly participation in a certain amount
of social activities. We cannot believe
that social activities should be overem-
phasized “in a student’s life; but not any
more can we believe that a student pre-
paring for later life outside of academic
walis should completely omit social ac-
tivities, A golden mean of moderation
should be reached.

It is not difficult to observe that this
golden mean has not been reached at
Davidson. And so the objective of the
Student Policies Union has been the

fulfillment of the need for social reform.

But this need for social reform is a
very generalized matter with many and
varied aspects; and that is why the sub-
ject of our petition has crystalized into
a specific request for dancing on the
campus; for we believe that the present
status of Davidson dances is the focal
point for a majority of Davidson social
maladjustments.

Before setting forth our reasons for
petitionng dancing on the campus we
most earnestly wish to make clear our
spirit in presenting this petition.

We feel very heavily our obligations
in upholding and perpetuating that es-
sence called the Davidson Spirit. And
we feel that an important part of the
Davidson Spirit is the relation of the
students to those in authority, not only
to those most closely in contact with us,
the faculty, but to the whole background
of the college. Davidson is a school run
by the Church; and, whereas it is not
so narrow as, to exclude students of
other denominations, yet the life-spring
behind’ the college, the whole source of
all its traditions and regulations, of its
character and aspirations is the Southern
Presbyterian Church. ‘Those placed in
authority over the students are in a
definite way in loco parentis. And so it
is that with respect and honor to their
principles we are at present making this
petition. We go to them in much the
same way as we would go to our own
fathers, not rebelliously, nor flauntingly,
nor with a carping spirit.

And now we wish to set forth our
reason for what we ask.

For the moment we should like to dis-
regard the rightness and wrongness of
dancing while we examine the existing
evils which encircle its practice by David-
son students. It is easy to see that
dancing is inevitable—whether in its good
and proper form or in its low and de-
graded form. Students will and do dance.
Its inevitability has in a way been recog-
nized by the authorities through their
definite provision for Davidson dances
off the campus. Seeing that a great fac-
tion of sentiment has looked upon danc-
ing as a grave impurity which would
harm the high ideals of a church school,

Davidsonian Sponsors
Ballot Among Parents

A ballot of the parents of the
‘Senior Class sponsored by THE
DAVIDSONIAN in conjunction with
the Student Policies Union has re-
cently been completed. Letters
were sent to the parents of each
member of the class explaining the
movement now on foot to bring
dancing to the campus. A ballot
was placed in each letter allowing
the parents to mail in their opinion
on the question asked.

The question was: “If dancing
had been permitted on the Davidson
campus at the time you were choos-
ing a college for your son, would
you still have chosen Davidson?”
The ballots did not have to be signed.

Out of about one hundred and
ten letters sent out, there were sixty-
one answers received. Of this num-
ber, fifty-three said they would have
sent their sons to Davidson had
there been dancing, on the campus
at the time, and only eight said they
would not have done so.

‘When the Board of ‘Trustees of David-

hold its regular biennial session of two
or three days, it will be presented with
petitions and resolutions of vital concern
to the entire sttident body by several pe-
titioning bodies or organizations within
this group, :

Foremost among these and that which
will concern requests which have been
the topic of much local and outside dis-

which now comprises more than seventy-

of the student body.

The primary objective of the Student
Policies Union is the improvement of so-
cial conditions on the Davidson College
Campus. This it hopes to bring about by
having the ‘Trustees grant its requests
which ask for the erection of a new and
adequate Social Center and that dancing
be permitted on the campus. Should the
latter request be granted it would

1931 when the Trustees last considered

in the Centennial building program which
was made public last Fall but the Stu-
dent Policies Union feeling that funds
will not be available to provide for all
the construction included in this pro-
gram, will ask that this be the first build-
ing erected.

This question has been agitated in 7he
Davidsonian off and on the past
several months through editorial and
open forum comment to which a number

for

of Davidson alumni and supporters have
contributed. The Union, through this
medium, has attempted to show that un-
less adequate provisions are made on this

tition form. Although the detail nature
of their requests has not been made pub-

influential will converge
in asking for a Social Center, It has
also been learned that the Ilonorary Fra-
