Debaters Go 4-8
In Auburn Mateh

The debate team compiled
a 4-8 record in a six round
tournament last weekend at
Auburn ‘in competition again-
st Alabama. Florida, Miss.
issippi, Sanford. Tennessee.
and Vanderbilt.

The topic debated was
‘Resolved: That the execu-
tive control of U. 5. foreign
policy should be significant-
ly’ curtailed.”

The negative team of Jim
Cooley and Fletcher Hart-
sell had a 3-3 record. Their
three loses were by a com-
bined total of five points.

Gray Mason and -Jule
Young took the affirmative
and logged a 1-5 record. The
weakness of this effort re-
flects the fact that the nega-
tive teams are winning about
80 percent of their matches
this year.

The next varsity tourna-

ment will be held at Emory
on October 31. It is one of
the biggest tournaments - in
the South. Jim Cooley. Flet-
cher Hartsell, Gray Mason
and Jule Young will probab
ly represent Davidson at

THE OTHER DAVIDSON --

A Community That Trusts Qnly Itself

By ROBERT PYEATT
Associate Editor

A subtle feeling of distrust
and resentment toward the
white establishment is pre-
valent among many citizens
of The Other Davidson.

It is the product of long
years or residence here and
many fruitless efforts at
dealing with the town govern-
ment and its many com.
mittees, the college and local
employers and manufactur.
ing firms, businesses and in
some _ instances federal
bureaucrats from Charlotte.

The feeling of distrust man-
ifests itself often in the area
of employment. Many feel
that whites receive priority
in hiring and advancement
at most firms in the David-
son area.

One resident of The Other
Davidson says that some
businesses in town will hire
Negroes and later say. that
they are not working and
tire them.

“But then they go to,
Mooresville and get jobs
there and they seem to Work
all right there.”

Most of the people of The
Other Davidson who do not
work for the college work
out of town. primarily in
Mooresville. The two textile
mills in Mooresville are gen-
erally felt to be the best
employers.

“Only white women are
working at Carolox. At Caro.
lina Asbestos (H. K. Porter
Co.) they don't hire Negroes.

“They have been in David-
son for years and years and
they go back to what grand-

are wasted, for they have

father used to do. They do
things the same old way."

Carolox Corp. personnel de.
partment said that it has ‘'no
Negro employes at this
time."’ They declined to re-
lease wage figures and num.
ber of personnel.

Jim  Fortner, personnél
manager of H. K. Porter Co.,
said the average wage for
Porter’s 60 production work-
ers is over two dollars an
hour. or $4160 per year, with
only five employes earning
less than that.

“We've always employed
colored people, ever since I
came here in 1933,"" he said.
“It varies. Sometimes as

accomodate both married
students and guests.

“It is our belief that this
would be a valuable invest.
ment for Davidson especially
since the Guest House is not
adequate, and the number of
married students is increas-
ing.”’ Hazel added.

M.S.A. operates as a self-
supporting unit financing
its own activities. “We
started a ‘Welcome Wagon’
this fall for the new married
students. About a dozen mer-
chants donated gift certifi-
cates to help the new couples
when they first arrive,”” Ha-
zel sdid. .

Cashion’s Supermarket has
agreed to donate one per-
cent of the married stud-
ents’ receipts to the MSA
treasury.

The married students pub-
lish a directory on which
they give brief sketches of
each couple. They are also
planning a “Married Stud-
ents’ Follies’ in the spring
in order to raise money for
a playground.

The Union Board is plan-
ning to give financial assis-
tance to the association for

babysitting in order to inte-

grate the married students
into the college community.

“We just cannot afford to
pay $1.00-an-hour for baby-
sitters as the faculty does.
And since most of the high
school girls in the commun-
ity are busy or have jobs.
It is almost impossible to get
anyone to babysit for 50c-an-
hour,” Martha Eakes, vice
president of the association,
said.

“With a little help, we
would be able to get baby-
sitters so that we would have
time to enjoy some of the
activitiés on campus,” she
added.

They won't let Negro women

“At the shirt factory
(Mooresville Mills) and
Reeves Brothers they have
Negro secretaries.”

The average wage at Gen-
eral Time is over two dollars
an hour for production work-
ers, ranging between $1.70
and $3.80, said Earl Adams,
personnel manager.

“TI don’t recall having any.
applicants from the college,"
he said. He added that ‘‘ex-

one reason why General Time
moved to this area.

“We have quite a few Neg-

minimum.

Whether these feelings are
grounded in absolute fact or
not is not important. What is
important is thateresidents
of The Other Datidson are
distrustful of"’the “Qominant
majority if the town.

The white community has
very little conception of how
much the Negro community
doubts thgjg intentions.

Even on the Mayor's Com.
mittee on Community Rela-
tions, which many white
people feel to be a symbol
of open and honest communi
cation between the two
groups, distrust is prevalent.

Some Negro members of
the committee feel that the
white members meet with.
out them before the regular
meetings and that the reg-
ular meetings are rigged.

It is very difficult for the
black community to believe
that most white people are
sincerely motivated.

The black community has
reasons to be distrustful —
long years of experience of
living in Davidson, of frustra-
tion and defeat.

Conditioned by years of
dealing with the white estab-
lishment, The Other David-
son has come to trust only
itself.
