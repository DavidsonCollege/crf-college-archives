Presidential Hopefuls Give
Views On Campus Issues

Jim Bootle, Henry Shue and Verner Stanley, candi-
dates for student body president, expressed their feelings

on important campus issues today, in response to ques-
tions asked by The DAVIDSONIAN.

1. Evaluate the work of the
1959-60 Student Council. What
were the chief assets and
strong points? What were
drawbacks?

BOOTLE: While this year’s
Council made few significant
changes or advances in the field
of student government, much of
its time was spent feeling out
its own strength. This, in my
opinion, is not degrading; its
progress will be a definite asset
to the Council next year.
Sparsely attended. meetings as
well as an unmistakable lack of
interest on the part of some few
of its members were clearly
drawbacks to eificient function-
ing of the Student Council, and
left it open to criticism.

SHUE: The chief contribution
was, among others, raising the
issue of the fate of students
shipped for honor violations—
whether one favors or opposes
a change in past practice, the
question of the responsibility of
a Christian college to a man
who needs re-direction is a
basic one. The Council's chief
drawback was that it couldn’t
move because it was standing
on its own coat-tail in the sense
that the Council couldn't find
anything to do because it in-
terpreted its scope too narrow-
ly.

STANLEY: The Council year,
1959-1960, was spent in search-
ing vainly for areas into which
student government could pro-
ject itself, I feel, however, that
a more concise definition of the

. group’s function is now réalized
by the student leaders. Specific-
ally, the Council must act more
as a “rabble rouser” in issues
of controversy. The purpose
and function of the new Council

must be redefined, however, for
the benefit of the student body.

Drawbacks to a more effic-
ient Council were lack of power
to handle matters that pertain-
ed directly to the student. The
Council also failed to assume
the role of arbitrator between

of this failure, the Council repel
ed several opportunities to as-
sume the role intended for it.
2. What do you consider

|

|

the most important problems
facing student jeaders for the
coming year? |
BOOTLE: Perhaps the most |
important problem for student}
leaders will be winning the!
help and support of those stu-|
dents who elect them. One per-|
son, opposed from all sides, can
accomplish little, and will soon
lose his own self-confidence.
SHUE: The one most import-
ant issue is the role of the Stu-)
dent Council. Other significant |
issues include: acting as gad-|
flies for the purpose of inspir-|
ing fellow students, faculty}
members, and trustees to de-

velop a conscious and consistent; *

philosophy of education which |
faces questions like the tension |
between academic freedom and
religious commitment.

STANLEY: To me, the most
important problem facing cam-
pus leaders is in making sure
that their positions do not be-
come mere figureheads. They
must strive to initiate original
ideas and to channel them into
action. Also, existing is the
problem of ‘nterpreting student
opinion by means of a poll or
forum. It is their duty to relate.

Q: Do you think that David-

in the Southern Conference?

A: “Yes. We've won fairly
recent championships in tennis
and golf and we came close in
swimming this year. As for foot-
ball and basketball, this is the
situation: There is a wide range
of scholarship aid in the South-
ern Conference, going from
West Virginia on the top level
to Davidson at the bottom. I
certainly don’t think that we
can compete with West Vir-
ginia, and we don’t.

basketball championship in the
Southern Conference. But I be-

lieve that it is worthwhile for
us to stay in. If we got out,
there would be many schools
that we would no longer be able
to compete with, and the minor
sports program would be seri-
ously affected.”

Dole continued to point out

that last fall's losing football
season was an unusual case be-
cause of the advent of the fresh-
man rule. “We had five win-
ning teams up to this year,” he
said, “and I'm not ready to
throw in the white towel now.
When it appears that we can't
win in the conference, I'll be
the first to admit it.”

Q: But won't the freshman
rule present the same handi-
cap this year as last year?

A: “No, it'll still be a handi-
cap, but not as serious. We have
more sophomores than we've
ever had, and with the scholar-
ship money I have this year, I
hope to get 15 or 16 new boys
and some without aid.”

with an academic average ||

doesn’t measure up — who
just doesn’t have the ability
to play college footbali—do
you let him keep his scholar-
ship anyway?

A: We've never cut a boy’s
scholarship. There is an NCAA
rule against taking a_ boy's
scholarship away from him.
Some of the Southern Confer-
ence schools are trying to get it
changed.”

Q: Would you like to see
the rule changed?

A: “I think that when a boy
accepts a scholarship, the in-
stitution giving it is morally ob-
ligated. I don't believe, in fair-
ness to the boy, he should be
cut adrift.”

Q: What if he shows no de-
sire to play and can afford to
come to school without aid?

A: “We've never had that
problem here because of the
integrity of the boys who come
here. I've had boys come in
here and tell me they'd like to
give up their scholarship be-
cause they've realized they can’t
play football for us.”

Q: What do you consider
the purpose of the Davidson
College athletic program?

A: “I think that athletics is
an integral part of the total ed-
ucational program. I think a
boy who competes in athletics,
regardless of the sport, is learn-
ing some lessons which are
hard to get anywhere but on

the athletic field.”

A Queens-Davidson field day, sponsored by Alpha
ture Today and Yesterday; Phi-| Tau Omega fraternity, will be held Friday, April 1, at
losophy and Religion; and Your| 4:30 p. m. in the football stadium. From 7 to 10 p.m.
Community and Your Business: Loonis McGlohon’s Combo will play for a Sock Hop in

will go to charity.

Charles Roberts, director of
the Queens-Davidson Olympics,
stated, “The Queens sororities
are going to send teams over to
jcompete in a chicken-catching
contest, a tricycle race, a sack
| race, an egg-throwing contest,
‘and other events.

“We're also having a scooter

faculty members competing. At
the intermission of the Sock-
Hop a trophy will be awarded

liously as possible,” Roberts IFC will sponsor it next

grants are to be a certain
percentage of the general
fund?

A: “No, I think this is a very
healthy arrangement. Because
now, everything comes through
the college and there is less
confusion.”

Q: Do you feel that you get
enough to compefe in the
conference?

A: “We need a little more
and I think eventually,
get it. Sometimes scholarship
programs are a waste—but you
have to have enough boys to
get the job done. Our problem
last fall was that we only had
32 boys. That wasn't enough.
Ideally, we need from 40 to 44
boys.”

Q: Is it correct that foot-
ball scholarships are based on
ability rather than need?

A: “I try to consider need.
But if I find a boy who is a

good football player and I have

to give him a scholarship to get}
him to come to Davidson, I'll

give him one.

Q: But can you justify giv-
ing aid to a boy who could
otherwise afford to attend
Davidson, while other stu-
dents have to struggle to get
through?

A: “Yes, because of the so-
ciety we operate in. The South-

ern Conference subsidizes and
we have to sudsidize also to
compete. Also, I think a boy
has to be unusual to keep up
his grades and play fwvotball
too. I think he needs some in-
centive. .
