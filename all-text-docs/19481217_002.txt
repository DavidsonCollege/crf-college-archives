YMCA Gift Fund

Although much has been said concerning
the YMCA. Gift Fund this year,
fe more comments would not be out of
order, First, [ think Jack Payne is-+hie a tre-
mendous vote of thanks for a job well done
in engineering this project. It was a tough
and thankless job of planning and coordinat-
ing a program to reach every member of the
student body and faculty, an end which he
very successfully achieved.

Also, congratulations to those members of
the student body on the halls of the dorni-
tories who assisted Jack, by contacting the
students and securing the pledges.

to support this very worthy cause and were

However, a large part of the credit for the
success of this campaign must go to the stu-
dent body at large. If it had not been for
you the drive could not have possibly been a
success. I think every man ‘who worked with
Jack on this campaign would like to thank
the students for their great cooperation and
generosity. The support received shows that
Davidson men recogitize real values and go
all out to be of assistance to others who are
less fortunate than we.

Christmas Vespers

While we are handing out laurels, we
should not forget those who made possible
the very impressive Christmas vespers last
Sunday night, concluding the college vesper
services for this year. The reputation of this
service from year to year is evidenced by
the tremendous erowd present, coming from
the surrounding communities.

‘Y" Secretary Bill Smith and Ed Hopper,
assisted by a crew of valiant helpers of the
student und college jworkers, did an
excellent job decorating thé auditorium for
this momentous occasion. The evergreens and
candles certainly provided an appropriate
background for the Christmas message and
the beautiful Christmas musie.

The concert band, direeted by Prof. James
Christian Pfohl, provided the atmosphere
for the Christmas Story, read by Curtis
Harper. To complete this atmosphere of wor-
ship the Glee Club, under the direction of
Karl Berg, supplemented the story with their
beautiful anthems. I think all will agree with
me that this service was one to be remem-
bered and especially appropriate as we leave
for our Christmas holidays this week.

Letters To Editor

I have just finished reading the most re-
of THE DAVIDSONTIAN and
found it interesting, well-planned and well-
edited with the exception of one article, This
article, a review (I use the word loosely) of

Red and Black Masquers, it appears ‘with the
by-line of Phil Mitchell. It seems that David-

sophomore does not have.

I notice with great interest that*'The chief
factor which prevented the play’s being a

der, but on the whole “Arsenie and Old Lace

Perhaps if our eritie would specialize in
Frankenstein instead of Brewster, his re-
views would be a little more convineing. This
statement could also be carried over into that
paragraph which compared Page Jackson's
“horror and consternation .. . closer to that
of a husband ‘who has lost his eollar but-
ton...” Practically anyone who has lost a
collar button could be expected to voice
consternation, but I doubt if anyone would
search for a collar button with a look of

ment concerning Miss Copeland, I believe it

timated that Miss Copeland was too much
her charming self to be a success in the role
of the equally charming Elaine Harper, Con-

Since the student body Of Davidson is
peculiarly lacking in dramatie erities (espe-

to suggest this motto for those who follow

The article criticising’ the production of

criticism for a professional play, but for the
amateur production, which was presented
here at Davidson, it was entirely unjustified

week-end, in than striking
contrast, to previous week-ends.
Although football among the fra-
ternities has definitely given away
to basketball in the “crackerbox,”
mention should be made about the
past season. Coach Randy Ensign
did a wonderful job with the Pikas,
piloting them to four wins, and a
tie for fifth place. In two other
games, at least, the score could have
gone either way, but didn’t. Orchids

Brother Mills found it necessary

that his opinion is highly valued

opinion that Liston’s testimony on

Dear Editor:

In vegard to the highly enter-
taining but most inadequate review
of the recent Red and Black Mas-
quers’ production appearing in the
last issue of “THE DAVIDSO-
NIAN, let us extend a warm hand
to the obviously in-
experienced critic, for if anyone is
it is he. To
criticize justly a bad performance
would have been commendable, but
to expose completely one’s utter ig-
norance of theatre art as well as
basic theatrical technique must be
humiliating. Although there were
minor weak points in the presen-
tation—for this is not a professional
group—we \onder if our critic has
any idea of even the skeletal na-
ture of “Arsenic and Old Lace,” To
require horror developed in an audi-
ence who was definitely prepared
for comedy—for such was the na-
ture of “Arsenic and Old
absurd. An accurate criticism
need not warrant a precise under-
standing of every delicate detail;
nevertheless, it certainly” demands a
basic conception of the subject.

The Masquers do not ask for, nor
need, patronage; but they do deserve
justice which was, needless to say,
not their portion according to this
inaccurate and unfair review. We
would like to extenuate on the gross
understatement in which Mae Holly
was labeled as “support.” She was
that, but much, much more. Her
most excellent and convincing por-
|trayal was one of the highlights in
an already delightful comedy. She,
together with Susie Jackson, thrilled
the audience as they selected their
next “objects of charity.’’

Obviously, John Crockett did
more than a “capable” bit of acting
in his role of the gruesome Jona-
than, the nephew of the Brewster
sisters. We would like to correct at
this point the misapprehension of
our critic; “Arsenic and Old Lace”
Was not a farge, and John Crockett
only looked like Boris Karloff.
While we are correcting misappre-
lensions, we might add that there
is no need for placing the “blame”
of a “moderate” success on anyone;
the play was a total and complete
success! If our presumptuous critic
had_been_paying-close-attention-we4
feel that he would have observed
Mr. Jackson's excellent portrayal of
Mortimer and the equally charming
and true thespian portrayal of Elaine
by Nancy Copeland. She, along
with the others, was a great suc-
cess,

A final word must here be said
concerning those who “muffed their
lines and failed to synchronize the
throwing of off-stage and’ on- Stage
light switches.” As we have already
pointed out, the cast was not com-

posed_of—professionals. Yes, there
were a few lines missed here and
there, but they were quickly picked
up and executed in a:most profes-
sional manner by the other members
the cast. Praise must also be
given to the stage crew which is
too often overlooked when the lau-
rels are being heaped upon a pro-
duction, George McKee, the elec-
Ed Parker, the stage man-
ager, and all of their assistants cer-
tainly performed magnificently a
most difficult task, Without these
persons, no performance would be
possible. They labored in their job
of preparing the set possibly longer
than anyone, even the cast.

Permit us to make a final sug-
gestion, however, to the director
and other member of the cast. In
the event that the Masquers should
take this show on the road, may
We suggest that they procure the
talents of Mr, Mitchell in portray-
ing Mr, Hoskins or Mr, Spinalzo.
We feel confident that he is more
than quite capable of handling this
role, and will possibly be able to
supplement his rather sketchy
knowledge of theatrical mechanics.
For if he is to continue in the ca-
pacity of theatre critic, he may find
need of it BEN MORRIS,

Dear Editor:
Attention: Phillip Mitchell,

Congratulations on the most en-
thusiastic comedy of errors that I
ever saw. As far as the dramatic
portion of the student body is con-
cerned you are decidedly damp on
the subject. We all know that Mc-
Neil Upchurch looked’ quite a bit
like Teddy Roosevelt, especially
when he beared his teeth. However,
I don't believe that is much of a
virtue. I'm glad I don’t look like
him. Anybody can be a character,
but it takes real genius to turn out
a fairly straight role.

Don't get me wrong. Upchurch
was plenty good, but-you omitted
the number one star of the evening,
Miss Mae Holly, who so far out-
shown Susie Jackson in her por-
trayal of the not-so-dominant sister
that_we recommend immediate
transportation to a Broadway set-
ting.

You were right, Mr. Mitchell, on
one point. The straight acting was
the weak link, but who could keep
a clear head in all that ruckus any-

ciate the way you criticized the
lighting, and left out George Mc-
Kee’s name. That stuff was just too
good for a college play. Best Jlight-
ing job we've ever had here. P; S.,
| agree with you that-it-wasa good
play—PAT McGEACHY, III,
(Editor’s note: Thanks for all
the good letters on the “Arsenic
and Old Lace” article. We ap-
preciate your criticism, nor can
we say that it is unfair or un-

Warranted.)
