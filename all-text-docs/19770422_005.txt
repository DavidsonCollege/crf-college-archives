Labels plague political spectrum

By L.K. STELL
Faculty Guest C lur-nist.

‘ Right” and ‘‘left’’ are commor
cutrency in political discourse. T’
War Protest Movement and the Black
Power movement are usually given as
exemplifications of ‘‘left’’ (or New
Left) political orientation while Wil-
liam Buckley and Barry Goldwater
are usually seen as exemplars of the
“right’’.

Heat or light?

Yet as Socrates was fond of
pointing out, unless we have a
definition for troublesome or con-

tested concepts, producing examples
generates more heat than light.

Opinion

Albert

By MARGARET HUNTER
Guest Columnist

My dear friends, do let us be
honest. They asked me to write
something funny; I delightedly and
dazedly agreed (how often do YOU
get asked to write something for the
Davidsonian?) and am now thwarting _
their desires and any chances of my
being asked to write again by
sneaking in an old fashioned bed-
time story.

Albert’s introduction

Once upon a time there was a
guinea pig named Albert. He worked
at a carrot salad factory all day long;
about 6 o'clock in the evening every
day he would show up at home
wanting supper and a big bow] of nice
peanut butter afterwards. Now Albert
hated working at the carrot factory;
he stood in front of an assembly line
with carrots racing by him every
minute. -His job was to grab them.
before they went past and to throw
then all into a grating-and-mixing-in-
raisins machine. Any brown ones he
let go by. He lived for the times in the
evenings when he could just sit and
eat peanut butter, watching TV. Then
one day God talked to Albert.

God’s guidance

He told him that he should talk to
the owner of a peanut butter factory.
The next weekend, Albert went to
church and saw his daughter's best
friend's father’s brother, who used to
date Albert’s wife’s cousin, in line to
get some good Sunday coffee. Albert
got in line behind him, mentioned the
weather and then how good this
man’s peanut butter was. Mr. Peaby
said, “Yes, but the quality of the nuts —
has been slipping lately.’’ At that
very moment God, hit Albert between

the eyes and caused him to blurt out— underdeveloped countries all over the,

Attempting to give definitions for
these terms seems doomed for three
reasons. First there is no way to
produce a non-circular definition
which grasps the meaning of these
correlative terms. The New Columbia
Encyclopedia defines ‘‘right’’ as ‘‘the
more conservative groups in the
political spectrum, in contrast to the
radical left...”

This stab at a definition does lead
to the second difficulty though, viz.,
that left and right are context
relative. You and I may favor the
same policy but our convergence may
require a move to the left from your
orientation and a move to the right

nine. Similarly, a turn to the

| “may be a left turn foryeu and a___that this arrangement derived from__

tigmu turn for me. Unfortunately,
while we possess means for defining
the compass directions, we lack
commonly accepted criteria for deli-
neating the left and the right.

Contested labels

Finally, the terms left and right do
not merely locate persons or things
relative to objects or continua whose
positions are known, they are also
appellations of approval and dis-
approval. In political debate, each
person has an incentive to rig things
so that the orientation he comes out

to have relative to his opponent is
advantageous to him. Depending on
the context of debate, labelling some-
one ‘‘right”’ or “‘left’’ (or center?) is
tantamount to placing him among the
good guys or the bad guys. Small
wonder that these labels themselves
are essentially contested.

Left versus right

Our Western Civilization course
notes tell us that “‘left’’ and “right”’
first acquired application in the
political relm because of the seating
arrangements in the French Natio:

- Assembly subsequent to the revolu

tion of 1789, although legénd «: : it

the more ancient practice of navir~
the Nobility seated at the King’s right
while representatives of the Third
Estate took their seats at his left.
However that may be, being a
member of the left quickly came to
mean that one was a kindred spirit to
the revolution of 1789. Pinning down
that spirit is as much like pursuing
phantoms now as it was then.

In the nearly 200 years that have
intervened, the terms left and right
have been subjected to so many
political uses that one must despair at
isolating any ‘‘core’’ meaning. Con-

obediently, “‘Ah then, what you
need is a peanut butter taster!” And
before the sermon started, Albert had
a new job.

He was very happy eating peanut
butter all day. The peanut butter
quality went up. Mr. Peaby was
pleased. Albert began to grow very
fat; and he learned a lot about how—
peanut butter is made.

He thought about going into his
own business making peanut butter,
but decided after consulting lawyers
and accountants and his wife, that
the pay Mr. Peaby paid him was
sufficient to make such an adventure
not profitable enought to warrant the
risks inherent.

Tractor influence

His wife made a trip to see her
parents one weekend. She went by
bus, and when she returned, of
course he was supposed to pick her
up at the station. On the way, the car
broke down. He went inside the
nearest building, which tumed out to
be a rather plush hotel (and he was in
his overalls!), called the station,
found out there was a tomado watch.
and her bus had been delayed 5 _
hours. He took the car to a gas
station, found out it was going to
cost him $150 to have it fixed within 5
hours, and it began to rain. He was
not happy.

He went back to the hotel because
he was bored at the gas station. He
went back to the hotel because there
was nothing to do at the gas station.
He noticed there was a convention of
“The Tractors for the World Associa-
tion” (TTFTWA) and he went in. He
needed something to, do! He sat

world. He also heard, just before he
impolitely dozed off, that peanut
butter oil is the main lubricant for
tractors.

Lubricants

Three years later, Albert was sitting
in bed (or lying? He was so fat it was
hard to tell) and he remembered that
day. Boing!!!! It suddenly hit him
that lubricants must be very fine_
quality or engines wear out, and that
he knew a lot about peanut butter
oil:.. He called the hotel and found -
out when the next TTFTWA conven-
tion was. He took a day off from work
to go, and dressed in his guinea pig
finest. He asked them if they needed
someone to insure that quality peanut
butter oil was sent overseas, and
handed then a resume which listed
his education at the bottom, his
peanut butter knowledge at the top.
They, after two weeks of conferring
among themselves, said yes.

sider the following applications:

1. Conservative-Progressive The
right is the party of tradition,
emphasizing the primacy of family
and clan loyalties, in general resistive
to change. The left is the party of
progress, change, perhaps radical
change.

2. Archism-Anarchism The right is
the statist party favoring policies
which increasingly subject all
“social” actions to authoritative con-
trol. The left is the party favoring less
and less government, perhaps no
government at all.

3. Individualism-Collectivism Tne
party of the right holds that indivi-
duals have sovereign rights which

‘must be protected_from collective: _

invasions, it asserts the primacy
mdividual welfare and that govern-
ment’'s sole function is the protection
of individual rights. The left asserts
the primacy of group rights, com-
munal concern, solidarity of the
oppressed, social welfare, and a
government active to secure these
things.

4. Capitalist-Socialist The right is
the party of private enterprise, the
profit motive, free markets, the
middle class. The left is the party of
state ownership, economic planning,
regulated markets, the working class.

5. Meritarian-Egalitarian The

accomplishments, the virtues of com-
petition, excellence. The left promotes
equality of income, the ideal of
cooperation, anti-elitism.

6. Authoritarian-Democrat The

right is the party skeptical of popular _

wisdom, favoring established autho-
rity; an appreciation of men of
quality. The left favors popular
sovereignty, believes in the wisdom of
the common man, is suspicious of
bureaucracism.

So which way is right? Is a political
party which favors dismantling the
federal government, the abolition of
taxes and yet advocates capitalism
and free trade a party of the left or of
the right? (Left under #2, right under
#4). How should we classify a person
who advocates the primacy of clan

re Tight favors-rewards-proportional-to———

attains happiness

loyalties and bloodties? (Right under

#1, left under #3). Does it matter if he
advocates Black Power and Black
Consciousness?

Consider a stable socialist dictator-
ship. Are its dissidents who press for
individual rights, the increased use of
material incentives in production and
popular sovereignty representatives
of the right(#3, and #4) or of the left
(#6)? %

The end of this story is that Albert
landed a very comfortable income, he
and his wife travel all over the
world now checking tractor oil
quality, and they are very- happy. The-
Kiwanis gave Albert a service award.
for being ‘‘instrumental’’ in an
overseas service project two years
ago, Albert has slimmed down since
-his peanut butter testing days, and is
a better lover than when he was
working in the carrot factory 10 hours
a day.

A moral

—_ This is a true story: The names —ight are absurd:

have been changed to protect the
innocent. Its moral (no, you can’t

down and heard a boring speaker__ escape, it!) is this: think about_what_

talking about getting money from
churches and sending ‘tractors ,to

you want to do, who you are, what>
you are good at, , what you, value. Then

——Is there any way of deriving ——

weighted averages so we could judge
persons to be left or right ‘‘on
balance’’? The difficulties in this

suggestion are obvious for the rela-

tion between a person's position on

anarchism-archism and progressi-
vism-conservatism is not like the
relation between the length and width
of a physical object. Length times
width yields the area, but one/s

position on anarchism plus (or times?)
one’s position on conservatism yields
nothing similar. The latter are incom-

mensurable 80 judgments about
whether one is ‘‘dn balance’’ left -or

__The more interesting question con-
cerns whether some combinations of
_ left_positions and right positions form

a coherent or incoherent political -
outlook. This moves us to the logic of
political philosophy. ; .
