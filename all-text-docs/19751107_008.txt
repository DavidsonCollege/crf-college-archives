Duke wins Douglas regatta

showed Duke University first,
with low score of 27; Davidson
second, with 32 points; and
the University of Virginia
third, with 42 points.

Old Dominion University,
North Carolina State Univer-
sity, and Christopher Newport
College finished fourth, fifth,
and sixth respectively.

Davidson team captain
David Frances skippered the
A Division boat, with fresh-
man Laurie Bingaman as
crew. Sailing in the B Division
boat were Chuck Barrineau
and Stuart Campbell.

The pattern of the afternoon

was set during the first three
races. In the first race, David-
son’s Frances, using the ad-
vantage of familiar home
boats, took a clear first.

Duke’s Brent Baibehenn,
(drawing on his extensive Jet
14 experience), took second to
Davidson in the first race and
won the second race.

The University of Virginia,
off to a slow. start with a
disqualification in the first
race, took first in the third
race.

The next home regatta will
be at Lake Norman on Satur-
day, November 15.

some people at other stations I
found out that apparently only
ABG,and Mutual Networks
News were offering their ser-
vices at no cost to college
stations,’ said Golden. “I had
heard both Mutual and ABC
news and much prefered the
latter.

“ABC news is the largest in
the country. They have been
very helpful and have practi-
cally bent over backwards to
help us. They probably benefit
from this deal with some sort
of tax write-off.

daily sports commentary is
available in the Contemporary
package, but we don’t plan to
use it unless there is enough of
a clamoring from sickie sports
fans in the area to have him.”
added Golden.

“Hopefully this is just one
in a whole line of improve-
ments we will be making at the
station this year. For exam-
ple, we are looking into the
possibility of going stereo.
Our engineer, Jeff Watts,
thinks he knows where we
could get a stereo generator
for practically nothing.

“Right now, though, we are
concentrating on getting ABC
News on the air by the
beginning of next term or in
January,’ concluded Golden.
