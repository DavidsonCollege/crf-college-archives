Campus Police > Break U Up
Beloved “Facultea Party”

“Tea without crumpets? Never!”

An unregistered tea party hosted
by several faculty wives was raided
yesterday afternoon between the
hours of 2 and 3pm. Lady London-
berry tea was being served without
biscuits or crumpets, reported two
campus police officers. There were
no risk managers. Several children
were milling about unsupervised.

When one faculty wife tried to
move the tea tray to another apart-
ment, she was informed that wives
can only transport tea from their
cars to their apartments, not from
apartment to apartment, and never
in an open container.

Officer Stonewall listed a lack
of wristbands and PCC stickers
in his official report. When the
hostess of the party, Mrs. Leonard
Fitzsimmons, protested, Officer

Four unwitting faculty wives, only moments away from being written up.

Stonewall read her Section 6.3B.IX
from the Red Book. Campus policy
clearly indicates that “no more than
four wives of untenured professors
can recreationally convene before
the division of the day UNLESS
they do so during the Vernal Equi-
nox OR the gathering is otherwise
sanctioned by a committee yet to
be created.”

Officer Stonewall also listed a
conspicuous absence of husbands
at the party, as well as three wives
of visiting professors. Whether or
not the Facultea Party was a dirty
rush event is not clear at this point,
though authorities have reason to

suspect it was.

Those attending the party have
complained of inconsistency in the
campus police’s attitude towards
faculty teas and luncheons.

“They took Muffy!” claimed
one bewildered spouse of a long-
time Humanities professor.

She complained, “One week
they let us munch away in peace,
and the next week they capricious-
ly write us up. Next week I may as
well just go down to the Court.”

RLO credits its new policy,
“Minimum fun, Maximum safety,”
for this successful bust.

Russia Targets
Miss Georgia

Russian tanks are planning
an invasion of Sally Dewitt, Miss
Georgia 2008, according to United
Nations authorities.

The invasion arose after a mis-
intepreted text message from Gen-
eral Ouremov to a lieutenant tank
commander. “Bomb Misses Geor-
gia,” wrote the general, referring

to a series of missiles accidentally
dropped on a nearby Azerbeijaani
goat farm.

A misinterpreted telegram has ved
to an attack on Miss Georgia ‘08

“The ‘m’ was supposed to be
lower case,” lamented General
Ouremov. “If our phones had T9
this never would have happened.”

Russian President Dmitri Med-
vedev remained positive despite
the accidental invasion. “Aside
from securing the former Soviet
provinces of Ossetia and Abkhazia,
the cute legs and luscious bosom of
Ms. Dewitt have long been among
nation’s top priorities.”
