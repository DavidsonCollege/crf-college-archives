EXTENDED TOUR

Meetings
at Grensboro, Asheville and Green-
ville, S. C.—Visit in Winston-
Salem

Ernest Milton, alumni secretary, and
Harllee Branch, Jr., assistant alumni sec-
retary ‘left Davidson Tuesday morning
on an extended tour of North and South
Carolina for the purpose of organizing
Davidson alumni in the leading cities of
these two states into local associations.

With the exception of a meeting of the
Gaston county alumni, held early in the
fall, the present tour marks the first step
in ‘the proposed organization of numerous
local groups of Davidson alumni through-
out the Carolinas. A tour of Georgia and
Florida by Mr. Milton shortly after the
opening of college in September resulted
in the organization of three new local
associations in Florida.

The first stop on the tour of the Caro-
linas was made at Greensboro, Tuesday
evening, when the alumni secretaries
were guests of honor and principal speak-
ers at a banquet arranged by Mr. John
McAllister, president of the Greensboro
association. Alumni from High Point,
Pomona and other nearby points attended
the meeting in addition to a large number
of the Greensboro residents.

On Wednesday Milton and Branch
were in Winston-Salem, where they in-

terviewed alumni who reside in that city.
In view of the impossibility of arranging
a meeting of the Winston-Salem alumni,
officials of the alumni office have chosen
this means of reaching the former Da-
vidson students who reside in that city.

ville will met at the George Vanderbilt
Hotel, where a banquet has beeen ar-
ranged for them under the direction of
J. H. McConnell, Jr.,/of the class of ’25.
This will.be the first meeting of Ashe-
ville alumni and will be in the nature of
an organization meeting. Alumni from
Brevard, Black Mountain, Montreat, and
Hendersonville have been invited to at-
tend the meeting and to affiliate with the
Asheville association.

Friday evening will be spent at Green-
ville, S..C.; where the alumni association
will assist in a re-organization~of the
Greenville association. A ‘banquet at
Woodside Grill has been arranged by Mr.
F. K. Spratt, of the class of ’04, former
president of the Greenville Association.

standing the distance separating the pros-
pective bride and groom. Miss York is
one of *the state’s most charniing and
popular girls. Mr. Baker, who is a mem-

been confined for several weeks with ill-
ness. Only members of the two families
were present. Mrs. Rozelle is the daugh-
ter of Mr. and Mrs. B. J. Summerow, and

and W. R. Sparrow, '27, was chosen sec-

and adjoining cities entertained the 1927

coaches other guests included Dr. J. P.
Matheson, ’99, president of the General

Many of the alumni present made re-
marks during the evening, the trend of
the discti$sions being along the line of
athletics. Most noticeable was the com-
mendation of the two Davidson Coaches,
not a single word being offered in criti-
,cism, though the state schedule was un-
| successful.

WINSTON-SALEM

(Continued from page 1)

With the majesty of self-renunciation and
self-dedication to the cause of God, Jesus
laid Himself on the altar of service for the
welfare of humanity.

We must seek to make our life one of sac-
rifice rather than of mere ease and enjoy-
ment. In the service of God through the
church we can help to solve some of the great
problems now confronting the world. He is
counting on us; we must not fail Him.
