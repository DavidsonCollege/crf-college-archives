“MONKMEN” OFF ON STATE TRIP

WILDCAT TRACKS

Following Davidson’s
“MEN OF MIGHT”
Along the Athletic Trail

By Zeb Long, Jr.

Nobody expected the Wildcats to win

the State title on the track last Saturday. |
The fact that the Cats only qualified ten
men as against, for instance, Carolina’s
twenty-four, removed all hopes for a win.
But what the Cats set out to do, that they
did. The sprints were Davidson events,
with none other than young John Currie,
the pride and joy of eastern Carolina,
leading the way.

Those who expected Currie to equal or
lower his best time of 9.6 on the 100 were
“probably disappointed to some extent.
The “Flash” was‘content to win his long
suits, 100 and 220, without especial effort,
and let it go at thats There are many
things that enter into the time in which
a man runs his event. The competition,
the crowd, the track, and by no,means
least, that much discussed element of
psychology. Last year, Currie had to beat
MacPherson and Sides. This time, his op-
ponents were hardly as strong, though
Bruton of Duke ran his usual good race.

It sounded mighty good to hear the an-
nouncer blare out, “Currie, of Davidson,
holder of State record in 100 and 220, run-
ning in lane three.”

Whittle lived up to expectations fully.

Wildcats, Outhit, Rally in Seventh to

Saturday saw the Davidson Wildcats and
the Guilford Quakers meet ‘in a hectic. ball
game. After a long-drawn-out battle, the

slugfest, filled, with good; bad arid ‘indiffer-
ent baseball playing. Concord was the scene
of the encounter, the game having been
transferred from Davidson to that city”at
the request of alumni.

The Quakers started off with’ a bang,
marking up three counters in the first two
frames, but the ’Cats came back by pushing
over five in their half of the second.. Again,
in the sixth, Pat Crawford’s men pulled a
rally that seemed disastrous to the Red and
Black cause. A barrage of base hits sent’
McInnis flying to the showers, and “Doc”
Kugler took up the burden. However, be-
fore the dust settled, the Quakers had scored
six runs, and had grabbed the lead. Some
determined hitting, and the wildness of Rabb
enabled Monk’s crew to sew it up for good
in the seventh. Hal Johnston’s two-satker
with the bases loaded proved to be the win-
ning punch.

Fresh Enjoy Field
~ Day on Diamond

On last Thursday, May 3rd, the Davidson
Wildkitten baseball nine put on their biggest
slugfest of the year, defeating Coach “Bob”
Mitchell’s Rockingham Hi team to the tune
of 32 to 0.

Marrow pitched a masterly game for the
locals, allowing only three hits to the visiting
lads during the whole contest. Armfield and
Parker furnished the other end of the bat-
tery for the Freshmen.

The Rockingham Hi lads, under the lead-
ership of Coach “Bob” Mitchell, former
Davidson athlete, failed to uphold the high
standard of baseball performance set by them
during previous years. Dawkin, who started
the game for the visitors, was hit consist-
ently. He was relieved by Sedberry, but the
“’Cats” had tasted of blood and could not
be stopped, amassing an-overwhelming’ total
of 29 hits. McCaskell caught for Rocking-
ham Hi.

Marks and Goodson led the hitting for the
locals, gleaning a total of five hits each.
Covington clouted for the circuit.

TEAMS DETERMINED

Necessary for Hitters to Connect
With Southpaw Pitching—
Davidson Hurlers Look Good

Followed by the best of Doctor Charlie's
good luck charms; and carrying the hopes of
one Monk Younger in their bat. bags,, Da-
vidson’s contributions to the great American
game of baseball entrained yesterday for
their annual state tour. Smarting under de-
feats-at the hands of certain southpaws
among the so-called Big Five hurlers, the
Wildcats left with the determination to “win
or bust.” McInnis, Meadows, Henderson
and Kugler are the twirlers upon whom
Monk must depend to bring back the ’Cats’
self-respect in the state.

Duke, Elon, Wake Forest and N. C. State
are to be. met on successive days. At the
Bull City, it is most likely that the southpaw
slants of Jenkins or Belue will entertain the
’Cats. Briggs, Elon’s crack left-hander, who
already has one Wildcat scalp under his belt,
will likely hurl for the Christians, while Lan-
ning, for the Demon Deacons, and Rowe or
Allgood, for the Technicians, are probable
mound choices. For the ’Cats, Johhnie Mc-
Innis will draw two assignments, while Kug-
ler and Meadows will likely start the two re-
maining games.

tendency to become wobbly about the seventh
inning, and the swatsmiths get on to a few

Hark ye, and give ear with much
attentiveness, for, verily, great
things haye come to pass. In this,
the reign “of GOOD KING SPORT,
all true Wildcats are in line for a
feast of much athletic lore, from the
lowliest. horseshoe tournament to
.the greatest gridiron contest. Yea,
in this same periodical at seven day
intervals, will a well- known sooth-
sayer of the sport wheel, advance
certain theories and propound much
doctrine from the court of KING
SPORT. This renowned person-
age answereth ‘to the name | of
Jotin Q.,*on of Dickinson, a native
of the distant land of West Vir-
ginia, and in truth, a knight of the
Sport Table. He needeth no intro-
duction, for a home run is his pass-
port and a touchdown is his calling
card on this, the campus of OLDE

ye shall marvel.
