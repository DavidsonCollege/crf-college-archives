Robert A. Currie, business

plan to create a Fine Arts
Quadrangle consisting of Oak
and Elm Rows, the Cunning-

Eumenean and Philanthropic
Halls, and the Church.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

By ANOERS TRYDELL
Richardson Scholar

Editor's Note: This is
ticles written by exchange

the ninth in a series of ar-
students about customs and

characteristics of their homelands, or on their impres-

sions of Davidson College.
Recently I participated

in an “International Student

Retreat” at Williamsburg, Va. in which about 30 nations

were represented.

This meeting was highly in
teresting and enjoyable for me

f'with regard to the numerous

Sweden. I was amazed by the
remarkably extensive knowl-
edge of the ‘internal policy of
Sweden that a lot of these for-
eign students showed, and I
also found it quite interesting

questions

Bito see how unanimous their
.| viewpoints on this matter were.

A girl from Turkey was
convinced that Sweden Its the
most democratic country in
the world and a graduate stu-
dent from India regarded
Sweden as an earthly para-
dise! Both statements are of
course very much exaggerat-
ed but | must say | was
touched by the seriousness of
their opinions.

I could not help comparing
these viewpoints, which were
actually based on facts, with
those held by a good many
Americans. 1 have met. which
often neither are based on facts
nor relavent, but which ‘merely
reveal a sexual maladjustment.

True, some Americans seen) ot
have an earnest ¢uriosity of the

“socialistic” policy of Sweden | .

and therefore ask me to tell
them about this point, though
sometimes only to condemn it
as—-socialistic.

It seems to me that for
some persons the word socia!-
ism has a connotation of evil,
which probably stems from
mere ignorance. But as 1
understand it, Sweden is a
socialistic country even in the
minds of the Americans who
know anything about my
country. The facts, however,
are very different. What is
remarkable about Sweden is
the peaceful coexistence of

three systems — socialistic, '

co-operative and free enter-
prise.

satisfied with the reforms now

achieved, and they agree with |

Prime Minister Tage Erlander
when he says that with the new
pension act (all employees re-
quired to take a sort of life
insurance) the Social Democrats
have achieved their “last” ma-

NO CHANGES

F. W. Hengeveld, director of
admissions and registrar, em-
phasized that, as in the past.
students who are not planning
to make course or schedule

However, it is not likely
that the publication will cease

for the handbook will be
sought elsewhere. The mat-
ter will probably go before
the Publications Board. ‘‘It
is too valuable a publication
to be discontinued,” he said.

Jimmy Richardson, YMCA
president, approached the Pub-
lications Board through a letter
last spring, which indicated the
Y's reluctance to continue
printing the handbook, and re-
quested that the board assume
sponsorship. No definite ac-
tion was taken on the proposal.

“The YMCA is discontinuing
its association with the hand-
book for a number of reasons,”
Richardson explained. “First,
it is felt that the Y has no
business in the publishing field.

“Actually, all the ¥ does is
appoint the editor and pay
for printing costs. Under the
recent setup, there was no
direct control, as the appoint-
ed editor had complete free-
dom.”

A major consideration was
the expense, which limited oth-
er possible YMCA work, Rich-
ardson indicated. The publica-
tion averaged costing $500 over
the financial aid received
through advertising.

power, railways and forests.
in all other segments of the
Swedish economy, free enter-
prise is the overwhelming
pattern.

Sweden has the highest liv-
ing standard of Europe. It
could perhaps be still higher.
but Swedes like to enjoy life
as well as make money. The
highly progressive income tax
system is such that the work’
ers have little incentive to put
in overtime, and talented peo-
ple see little reason to pick up
extra jobs. But at the same
time they are less likely to get
