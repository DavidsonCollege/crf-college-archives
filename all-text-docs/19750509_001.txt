Trustee committee mandates
president to develop priorities

By ANDREW LAMAS
Executive Editor

The Board of Trustees met at
Davidson last Thursday and
Friday to discuss college goals,
student life and governance.

The Development Com-
mittee, the group to which the
Goals Committee reported,
mandated College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. to
develop a program of long-
range planning.

“As far as long-range plan-
ning is concerned, the president
is to come back to the trustees
in the Fall with a recommended
process for carrying out long-
range planning for this, in-
stitution,’’ remarked Spencer.

The Student Life Committee
addressed several problems
concerning the college health
service.

“A report from the Student
Life Committee indicated that
the medical personnel on the
Board of Trustees would be
asked to assist in evaluating our _
health service on campus;’’ ex-
plained Spencer.

Dean of Students ‘William ‘H.
Terry has been. designated as
the facilatator of the health ser-
vice evaluation.

Statement of Student Rights

By BIFF KIRBY
Staff Writer

The Statement of Student
Rights will become part of the
College Constitution no earlier
than February of 1976, if at all,
according to Trustee Gover-
nance Committee member
Blain Butner.

The Statement has been un-
der consideration by a sub-
committee on Governance of
the Board of Trustees since that
body’s October, 1974 meeting.

According to Subcommittee
Chairman Butner, this
Statement would state unam-
biguously the rights of students
in the areas of freedom of
association ad expression, par-
ticipation in ‘‘institutional
government,” access to student
records, and rights of students

accused of crimes .
The subcommittee drew on

several documents in_ its
deliberations.

Among these were a
Statement of Rights and

Responsibilities of Students
(approved since 1967 by the
American Association of
University Professors and the
National Student Association) ;
the old SGA Constitution (unap-
proved by Trustees’ or
Faculty); and a Model Bill of
Rights adopted by the 1975
North Carolina Student Legis-
lature.

The subcommittee members
were: Vice President John M.
Bevan, Dean Will H. Terry, Dr.
Alexander J. McKelway, Dr.
Hansford M. Epes, John Munce,
John Hornickle, and Butner.

Butner indicated that the
present draft Statement has not
been made public because of
the wishes of the Governance
Committee that it be submitted
that committee before being
released to the public.

A draft of the Statement was
presented to the committee’s
May 1 meeting, but the presen-
tation was not completed
because of lack of time.

The draft was therefore retur-
ned to the subcommittee until
the committee’s next meeting.
For this reason the proposed
document” has not’ been
released.

Art display area plans remain

By BRAD SWALWELL
Staff Writer

Plans for use of Chambers
Banquet Hall as an art display
area are still incomplete, ac-

cording to Director of the

Physical Plant Grover C,
Meetze.

Meetze said that he is
drawing up some plans and
writing up: some ideas on how
the banquet hall might be used
as exhibition space for the Art
department.

Meetze stated, however, that’.
“no decision has been made:

Jackson also stated that
work-study students could be
used'to staff the gallery.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer said in a Report of the
President to the Trustees of
Davidson College on May 2, 1975
that the college is trying ‘‘...to
work out additional temporary
space. for art, including the
possible use of Chambers
Banquet Hall as a multi-
purpose unit which could be
used for the National Print and
Drawing Exhibition.”’

Jackson stated that the

gallery would be multi-purpose
in that it could continue to ac-
comodate most of the functions
which currently are held there,

“We can continue to have the
small dinners, the registration
procedures, the Thursday mor-
ning teas, etc.,”’ said Jackson.

“The only thing currently
held in the hall that we could not
have are social events--the con-
certs and dances. They would
have to be held elsewhere,
probably the gym.”’

The only objection to using
the gym was that people could

The next step is therefore the
May meeting of the Governance
Committee. According to But-
ner the precise date for this
meeting has not yet been set.

If approved by the full com-
mittee, the Statement will be
made public, and reaction will
be invited. Presentation to the
Board of Trustees will follow at
that body’s October meeting.

The Board will decide the
issue at its February meeting, if
the subcommittee’s  ex-
pectations are fulfilled.

Since the Statement is to be
an amendment to the Con-
stitution, a two-thirds majority
of the Board in favor of ap-
proval will be required for final
approval. ‘

“T personally want to see the
College adopt a_ strong
statement asserting the rights
of students, both those guaran-
teed by law and others granted
by the institution,’ said Butner.

‘‘A comprehensive statement
of this type can help to avoid
misunderstanding between the
students. and the institution in
the future.”’

The subcommittee was aware
throughout its work of the
qualifications imposed on such
a statement by the delegated
powers of the President of the
College. Article V of the
Trustee By-Laws states:

not dance on the new basketball
floor. That objection has ap-
parently been overcome.

‘‘We do have a covering for
the basketball floor now,’’ said
Meetze. “I do not know how
suitable it is for dancing.”’

Meetze went on to say that the
floor covering had been used
during the recent Alumni
Weekend. Saturday night of
Alumni Weekend a dance was
held -in the gym; the floor
covering worked fine for the
dance.

A banquet hall? An art gallery?
