Swimmers Sunk “\Athletic Council Discusses
By Virginia, 56-39 iRecent Additions, Needs

FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1965

The Davidson College swimmers fell 56-39 in
the meet with Virginia Monday, despite an excellent
performance. .

“We're real happy with some of the boys, I think
they are in good shape for this early in the season,
but we still have a long way to go,” commented
Coach Tom Stevens. “Swimming is a tougher sport
than most people think; you have to be in terrific
physical condition.” ;

Tom Irons, whose teammates think he has
broken a Davidson record, won his 200 yd. free-
style event with a 2:24 time. The exact Davidson
record is not known, however. .

The Virginia swim team had an especially good
day, breaking two of their own school records in
the 400 yard relay and 100 free-style.

Jim’ Stokes, expected to be the Conference’s
number one man in his specialty, took the 200 yard
butterfly with no trouble Monday. The captain,
Stokes said of the team effort, “This is the best team
we've had since I’ve been here, we’ve got more spirit
than ever. We are pointing toward the Conference
meet in March, and we will be in better shape by
then. Until then our biggest competitors look like
ECC and VMI.” ; ;

Co-captain John Helm was praised highly by
Stevens for his performance in the free-style and
butterfly. Also cited were Richard Holt, who was
said by Stevens to have great potential, if he dedi-
cates himself to working harder, Gary Peklo, who
had his best free-relay time in this week’s meet and
Bris Rodgers, a sophomore standout.

As for The Citadel meet next week, the swim-
mers will have quite a job beating the Bulldogs, espe-
cially if Captain Jim Stokes is unable to be at the
meet. He has an interview that day in New Or-

leans, but will probably fly back to Charleston in
time for the meet.

The Athletic Council of Davidson College met Saturday to decide on various is-
sues that had been brought before them.

The Council is made up of the Trustees, three or four members of the Wildcat
Club, representatives from the student body and various faculty members.

The Atheltic Department an-
nounced several new additions
to the facilities for athletics at
Davidson. They were made pos-
sible through the $50,000 match-
ing grants of the Richardson
Foundation and Davidson Col-
lege.

ADDITIONS

Completed are. the following:
(1) sandblasting and water-
proof painting of the entire stad-
ium, (2) the construction of a
modern press box, (3) the addi-
tion of fiberglass seats for the
entire stadium, and (4) the ren-
ovation of both the varsity and
the freshmen dressing rooms.

Also completed are (5) the re-
location of the public address
system for football, (6) a new
practice football field, (7) a new
baseball! field, (8) a new intra-
mural field, (9) construction of
new balcony seats for basket-
ball, and (10) improvement of
floor seating.’

, Contractors are working under
‘ the East Stadium and the follow-
ing are scheduled for comple-

| tion this winter: (1) new toilets

for men and women, (2) a dress-
ing room to accommodate 50
people, (3) a dormitory to ac-
commodate 36 people, (4) a
dressing room for Davidson
teams, and (5) six handball
courts, The handball courts will
not be complete four-wall! courts.

The completion of the new
facilities under East Stadium
will exceed the $100,000 made
available by the Richardson
Foundation and the college. The
additional expense will be pro-
vided for by Davidson.

The council also discussed the
needs of the Athletic Depart-
ment and devised some propos-
als to try to meet these needs.
Some of the ideas were as fol-
lows: (1) an assistant track
coach to help Coach Whittle—It
is almost impossible for him
to work with the 50-60 students
that participate in freshmen-var-
sity track; (2) making a class-
room which could be used as
a projection room and an office
on the balcony level immediately
behind the new bleachers; (3)

securing additional secretarial
help—at the present time there
is one secretary employed on
a 12-month basis and three sec-
retaries on a nine-month basis.
Beginning this summer, it was
proposed to have one of the sec-
retaries working only part of
the year to be employed on a
12-month basis.

Also under consideration are
(4) a small bus or limousine to
transport teams for games away
from Davidson—this proposal
would be for the minor sports
for the safety of the teams, in-
stead of having the students
take their own cars: (5) light-
ing for the football stadium and
track—this proposal is for the
physical well-being of the teams.
For the first two football games
in September, it has been pro-
posed that they be played at
night to reduce heatstrokes and
exhaustion: (6) a hard-surfaced
track: (7) a roofed area behind
the East Stands. This would
enable the football teams and
other outdoor teams to practice
during rainy weather.

Another proposal is (8) an
18-hole golf course for inter-
collegiate, student and faculty
play, but due to lack of funds,
this will not be taken up for
several years.

The student representatives,
Sonny Graves and Paul Mar-
ion, proposed that there be a re-
duction in rates at the Moores-
ville golf course to compensate
for the postponement of con-
struction of the college course.
The final need is (10) an assist-
ant trainer with the responsibili-
ties for the so-called minor
sports.

The main suggestions made by
Graves and Marion were that
the gym facilities be enlarged
or that the gym be kept open
more often to accommodate the
students, that students be able
to sit at the Charlotte Coliseum
at Davidson games on a first-
come, first-serve - basis—this
proposal was put into effect at
the game with Marquette last
night—and that lights for the
tennis courts be installed. Mar-
[pe said, “By far, the most

pressing need is more indoor
facilities open to students.”

There’s a change in curriculum. Toronado’s in! Front wheel drive with 385-horse

Rocket V-8 takes boredom out of the course! No more cramming—with flat floors, six passengers
