MATH & A ‘'S9ER*tS LAMENT
Dear Mr. Editor:

Around three months ago I, like
Many of the classes of '59, received
a notice from Mr. Hengeveld advising
me to take a refresher course in Math,
I wrote several of my friends already
on campus (I later learned it is a campi),
ahd told them my plans. From then on I
was doomed.

Instead of the review course in
Math, these friends decided that I should
take the whole year's work and be done
with it. It was a nice sumer, ‘tis
a shame I didn't get to find out how nice}

Although sometimes I wish I was
back home or on the beach or just
away from here, the majority of the
time I am content with the wonderful
college whose motto was translated to
me by a considerate upperclassman
Latin scholar as "We hate snakes more
than anybody."

I won't say it was a mistake coming.
this summer. In fact, I feel it gives
me somewhat an advantage over the freshe
men entering next fall. For on thing
I have gotten to walk on the grass to
my heart's content; and with a little
encouragement from the Greyhound
strike I have learned how to get back
to God's land, that is Lumberton, with-

out paying.

Although my feelings about Davide
son't summer range from the greatest
to the lowest depending mostly on
whether we are starting a week or
lookin; forward to a week-end, you
can be sure that come next fall I shall
be glad I was hereewat least I'l] tell
all the green freshmen that}

Ne Ultra and all that,
