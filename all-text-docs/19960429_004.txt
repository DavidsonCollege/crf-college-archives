Senators reveal results of dorm storming

By Brooke BAGWELL
Staff Writer

The SGA compiled a final re-
port of the Dorm Storm campaign
and published the results last Tues-
day. Dorm Storm ’96 was headed
by the SGA Committee on Polling
and Response to get a consensus

on student opinions and concerns.

Several academic concerns
surfaced involving Davidson’s
mission as a liberal arts institution.
Students believe the option of mi-
nors allows them to pursue inter-
ests of study beyond the focus of
their major and develop a strong
liberal arts background. Some stu-

dents suggest class size be de-
creased to encourage discussion
and a more intellectual environ-
ment.

As the report says, “There (is)
a generally pervasive sense that
Davidson is fostering an environ-
ment that is too academic and not
intellectual enough. Classwork too
often precludes students from at-
tending lectures or supporting ath-
letic teams on campus.”

Many students are frustrated
about perceived grade deflation and
inter-departmental competition for
low GPAs. Others express con-
cern that the pass-fail option dead-
line be extended to allow better
evaluation of course progress be-
fore decision-making. Most stu-

dents also expressed a desire fora
more gender and minority diverse
faculty, especially in the natural
science and math departments.Stu-
dents want a more culturally di-
verse campus as well.

Some students object to col-
lege admission preferences for in-
dividuals who have high SAT
scores and good grades, but who
are perhaps not well-rounded
enough.

The issue of Davidson athlet-
ics generates great concern among
students. For the most part, stu-
dents address the problem of fund-
ing. Most students hope for the
college to remain in Division I
athletics, and realize the necessary
increase in funding to strengthen

college teams and make them more
competitive. Others would like to
see athletic funding diverted, ei-
therto give more aid to club sports,
or to allow more financial aid for
need-based individuals. The con-
sistency and flexibility of Baker
and Johnston Gym hours was an-
other issue, along with a general
desire for improvements of the
track.

Students generally hope for a
greater variety of dining options.
They want more healthy, low fat
foods, especially fresher produce
and higher quality vegetarian en-
trees. Others simply call for a
widening of the food selection and

Environmental studies concentration?

By KirsTEN RECKNAGEL
Assistant News Editor

An Environmental Studies
Concentration may soon extend
students’ academic options, ac-
cording to David Martin, Profes-
sor of Economics. To create a
concentration, he says, “There has
to be an expression of interest ei-
ther by students or faculty.”

Such support has been seen
periodically throughout the past
several years, and Martin recently
took responsibility for the “organi-
zational gruntwork” of such a
project.

Martin recently submitted a

draft proposal to Dean of Faculty

. Robert Williams who offered sug-

gestions and feedback. The pro-
posal lists courses currently of-
fered at Davidson which would
likely satisfy concentration require-
ments. A major stumbling block
to an environmental studies con-
centration, explains Martin, “is the
scarcity of environmental courses”
now being taught.

Tentative solutions to the lack
of variety of courses now available
include the possibility that students
may modify existing courses, tai-
loring them toward a more envi-
ronmental focus.

According to tentative plans

for a concentration, however, the
environmental studies concentra-
tion would consist of one statistics
course and five electives, four of
which must be outside a student’s
major.

Martin hopes that after a sum-
mer of serious work, a specific
proposal might be submitted to the
EPC as early as next fall. If ap-
proved, it would eventually con-
tinue on to a faculty vote.

In the meantime, says Martin,
“What I advise people to do is to
take the courses [geared toward
the environment]. [Students] can
essentially design their own quasi-
concentration.”

IVCF

from page |

Committee members voiced
their concern that IVCF’s consti-
tutional policy conflicted with
Davidson College’s nondiscrimi-
nation policy by unjustly discrimi-
nating against homosexuals.

The lengthy debate which re-
sulted from Sophomore Class
Senator Eric Sapp’s motion to re-
new IVCF’s charter regardless of
the committee’s failure to recom-

mend such action was tabléd for
one week to allow Senators to con-

duct legal research and in-depth —

examination of the situation’s ap-
parent conflict between civil liber-
ties and religious freedom.
“What's happening: now on
this campus is incredible,” says
Independent Senator Tim
Saintsing, a sophomore, who gave
an emotional speech in which he
repeatedly quoted an elderly black
woman in reference to her protest
against integrated busing: “My feet
is tired, but my soul is rested.”
However, Saintsing voted to
renew the charter. He explains that

he initially adopted a stance “based
on.personal [belief] that IVCF and
other groups that do discriminate
should not be chartered.” How-
ever, after much research and de-
bate, during which he says he was
“forced to separate personal feel-
ings from [official policy],”
Saintsing cast his vote Tuesday in
answer to the question: “are they
(IVCF) following the rules?”

Debate which resulted from
IVCF’s charter request has forced
people to question there own be-
liefs concerning civil liberties, and
freedom of religion and speech.
Such questioning, says Saintsing,
marks “a new Davidson phenom-
enon.”

Last Tuesday, several mem-
bers of the administration and fac-
ulty attended the SGA meeting at
the invitation of SGA President
Warren Buford. Before the gallery
discussion began, Buford asked
Davidson College General Coun-
sel Bart Landess and Political Sci-
ence Professor Mary Thornberry
to offer their insight concerning
the situation’s possible legal rami-
fications.

Landess noted, “IVCF from

my viewpoint meets the criteria to _

be chartered.”

While the SGA by-laws re-
garding charter requirements are
vague, the Student Organization
Handbook produced by the Union
clearly mandates that to be eligible
for charter, “Membership in the
organization must be open to any
member of the student body.”

However, this does not stipu-
late leadership, and IVCF mem-
bers are calling for their right to
practice freedom of religion.

Landess stressed his belief that
although the SGA by-laws were
not specific, Davidson’s “charter-
ing documents do not have any
requirements that IVCF has not
met.” He reminded the Senate that
IVCF’s compliance with charter
requirements is an issue indepen-
dent of the SGA’s possible desire
to change these requirements. The
Senate “can’t apply new ideals in
retrospect,” he said.

Although Thornberry con-
cluded her comments by stating,
“I’m certainly not here to tell you
how to vote,” several senators

voiced resentment of the
administration’s presence at the
meeting.

“I felt that [the administra-
tion] tried to intimidate members
[of the SGA], says Phi Delt Sena-
tor and sophomore Brian Brown,
who voted not to renew IVCF’s
charter. Brown explains that “my
gut feeling was” that IVCF’s char-
ter should not be renewed. Brown
spent the week which preceded the

vote trying to “reconcile my be- -

liefs to the spirit of the SGA by-
laws.” In the end, he says, “I voted
in good conscience.”

Head Independent Senator
Brian Luskey echoed similar sen-
timents last Tuesday in expressing
his belief that the SGA is neither
respected nor trusted by the ad-
ministration. Luskey, a junior,
voted for renewal of IVCF’s char-
ter because, he says, “I [believe]
the First Amendment in the Bill of
Rights protects even those groups
we disagree with.”

Because of this firm belief that
IVCF did indeed meet charter re-
quirements in accordance with

Davidson College policy, Saintsing
says he was “very surprised by the
outcome [of the vote].”

In light of the Tuesday’s re-
sults, Thornberry voices her con-
cern “about some groups seeming
to tell other groups what to be-
lieve.”

SeniorJason Byassee, ahighly
involved member of [VCF who
served on IVCF’s six member ex-

‘ecutive board last year, believes

that “on Tuesday night ... a really
slanderous image ‘of InterVarsity
was presented. The fact is,” he
states, “there are many people
whose honest and painful and dis-
ciplined reading of scripture says
that homosexual activity is not
okay. Clearly this hasn’t made us
any friends. Clearly this hasn’t
made us more popular ... We just
feel we’re being faithful to what
we [believe].”

Many students have asked
whether IVCF will respond to the
Senate’s decision by means of a
lawsuit. ‘“That’s not our inten-
tion,” says Stokes.

Allison Sabel, Senior Class
President and Chairperson of the
Charters and By-laws Committee,
noted last week that IVCF is free to
reapply for charter renewal at any
time, with or without modifying
their constitution. In addition, the
Senate’s decision not to renew the
charter may be overridden by Col-
lege President John Kuykendall.

Byassee confirms
InterVarsity’s position, stating, “ITV
incorporated is not going to sue
Davidson College over this.” Asa
group, he explains, “we’ll respond
in peace and love ... even if in
disappointment.”
