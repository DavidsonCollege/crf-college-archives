SGA senator’s hosted a ca-
tered dinner meeting with the
Davidson town council, as:well as
Davidson Mayor Russell Knox,
and Davidson Town Manager
Leamon Brice.

Saad Gul, Senior Class Presi-
dent and Chair of the SGA
Roundtable Committee, organized
the event, held two weeks ago in
the DuPont Room of Vail Com-
mons.

The Thursday evening dinner
was intended to provide an oppor-
tunity for student leaders and town
officials to get personally ac-
quainted with each other as a first
step in improving the student-town
relationship.

Although students did not
press any particular issues, hope
that the town might help with the
SGA’s rides program, now in the

works, was expressed by the Sen-
ate as a whole. In addition, stu-
dents voiced interest in some Main
Street shops establishing student
discounts.

SGA president Warren Buford
expressed gratitude that the Town
Council repealed the town’s park-
ing decision.

According to Buford, “On the
whole,[the town officials] were
very sympathetic to our concerns.”

Head Independent Senator
Matthew Hobbie, a junior, ate
with Town Manager Leamon
Brice. “We talked about a number
of issues. We talked a lot about
businesses on Main Street ... and
how there should be more stores
that gear themselves toward stu-
dents. [Brice] expressed the fact
that people in the town feel the
same way.”

“I think it is really important -

that we do this, “Hobbie contin-
ues, “because ... a lot of decisions

the town council makes affect stu-
dents, whether through parking, or
the Post Office, or businesses on
Main Street ...

is very important that students ...
talk in some way with the town
government.“

Julie Chevalier, Freshman
Class Senator, sat at a table with
Davidson's mayor, Russell Knox.
“The mayor seemed really open to
... Our opinons,” she says, “They
said that they had not had enough
student contact and wanted to have
more,” Chevalier continues.

Both student leaders and town
officials seem to feel the meeting
was a success and look forward to
a continued dialogue.

Town Manager Brice says,
“We were extremely pleased...I
think we discussed a lot of good
things.” ©

Buford says, “ The dinner was
a very positive event. It could

spark some good things in the fu-
ture in terms of student and town
relations.”

Town council members in-
vited the SGA to send a represen-
tative to Davidson’s monthly town

meetings.

In return, the SGA invited the
town council to send a representa-
tive to SGA meetings and has plans
to hold a formal meeting with the
town council in the future.

Johnston
Gym to
get new

fire doors.

By Ranpy HARTWELL

After years of exposure to the

elements, the rotten fire doors of

Johnston Gym are being replaced.
Though the doors have been func-
tional under official state fire regu-
lations for years, they haven’t al-
ways had the “panic bars” that
enable quick escape in emergen-
cies.

- Until now, the doors have just
been kept locked except during
events held in the gym, according
to Director of Public Safety Ray
Thrower. The new fire exits, com-
plete with “panic bars,” will be
part of an effort to spruce up the
aging hardware of the facility.

Thrower says College Union
Director William Brown ap-
proached him about the security of
the doors, since the Union uses
Johnston for programming.
Brown, who was out of town for
the weekend, could not be reached
for comment.

Ed Daugherty, co-director of
Davidson Outdoors, whose offices
are in the basement of Johnston
Gym, says he’s wanted to see the

doors replaced “since I started

working here.” But, he adds,
“We’re glad it’s happening. [The
new fire exits] are an important
step in securing the building.”
Associate Director of Opera-

tions and Management Phittip
Cashion says he and the Physical
Plant had hoped to locate better
doors within the College’s hold-
ings. Unable to find any, new fire
doors were ordered last week, and
Cashion expects them to be in-
stalled soon.
