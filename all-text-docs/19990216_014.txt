‘Cats Hold Off Georgia Southern

By STepHEN CEFALU

Normally, Bob McKillop spends
longer huddling with his assistants at
the beginning of a time-out. But after
Quentin Martin’s third three pointer
pulled Georgia Southern to within two
of the ‘Cats,
75-73, with
15 seconds
remaining
last Monday night, Davidson’s head
coach was in no mood for dallying.
Instead, McKillop quickly burst from
the company of his coaches and went
right to his players.

“It’s aclose game now. So what?
This is good for us!” screamed
McKillop.

Three seconds later, Jeff Bergmann
stepped to the free throw line and, dis-
regarding the various “choke” signals
on display throughout the crowd at
Hanner Field House (Statesboro, Geor-
gia), connected twice to give the ‘Cats
a 77-73 victory. .

“Clutch” would be the word to
describe Bergmann’s entire perfor-
mance down the stretch against the
Eagles (8-15, 4-9). The 6-foot-3 junior
from Elk Grove, Illinois scored 10 points
on the night. Eight of them came in the
final 10 minutes of play. Bergmann’s
inspired second half three-point shoot-
ing (2-3) almost single-handedly sty-
mied Georgia Southern’s potent offen-
sive attack.

‘As mighty as his output was,
Bergmann was not the player of the
game. That honor belongs to Landry
Kosmalski. “Special K” finished with
23 points and 10 rebounds, good for his

sixth double-double of the season. The
Bedford, Texas native won few friends
among the Statesboro crowd with his
thunderous first half jam and stellar
overall shooting (8-14).

The Wildcats led by nine (37-28)
at the half and by 18 with 15:33 to play,
but still had to withstand a barrage of
Eagle three-pointers before they.could
leave with a win. Georgia Southern’s
Fernando Daniel and Quentin Martin
shot a combined 7-14 from three point
range on the night, each finishing with
21 points. No one else scored in double
figures for the Eagles, who have now
lost six straight.

“This is a team that took Charles-
ton to the wire even more so than we
did. They made some big shots tonight
and made my heart skip a couple of
beats,” said McKillop in a post-game
interview.

Luckily, perseverance has been a
given for the ‘Cats of late. McKillop’s
club has won four in a row, eight of
their last niné, and 13 of their last 16.
With the win over the Eagles, Davidson
(15-8, 10-3) headed into this past week-
end remained deadlocked with Appala-
chian State (16-7, 10-3) for first place
in the Southern Conference’s North
division.

“We've been playing pretty darn
well. I’m pleased about that. I think
we’re moving forward in a big, big
way,” says McKillop.

Besides Bergmann and Kosmalski,
Davidson. received vital offensive con-
tributions from Davor Halbauer (15
points) and Stephen Marshall (14
points). Ali Ton also increased by 11
his Davidson Wildcats all-time assists
record.

‘Though it was not accompanied
by a tally in the “W” column,
Davidson’s Wildcats dispatched a re-

sounding mes-

“Don’t sing it, bring it. A freshman, Graham Gravely,

appropriately summed up the prevailing sentiment by

the members of both the men’s and the women’s swim-

ming and diving teams

as our season nears its climax.

We have been training for this meet since the first

weeks of school.

hideous understatement. I hope that Davidson will show

up to witness and share in our intensity. We are pre-

pared; it is time to dance.”

sage last Monday
night in a confer-
ence show-down
against the Southern’s defending
champion, first-place UNC-Greens-
boro.

“This game was very important
to us,” said JoAnne Hassel, “because
this was a gauge as to where we were.
Now we know that we’re at this top-
level. We know that we’re playing at
tournament-caliber.”

Greensboro entered Belk Arena
last Monday in a three-way tie for the
conference’ s top spot along with ETSU
and Georgia Southern. Davidson en-
tered the game with an 8-6 conference
record that landed them in fifth place,
but only two out of the lead.

The Spartans jumped out to a 13-
5 lead in the game’s opening minutes.
Led by a pesky, tenacious point
guard—S’6” ChoRhonda Gwaltney—
Greensboro showed tremendous de-
fensive athleticism, forcing 14 first-
half Wildcat turnovers.

Wildcat senior Jessica Montrella
found herself in foul trouble early and
often and played only 18 minutes be-
fore fouling out with 4:22 remaining.

Davidson 6
Greensboro 64

Junior Katy Kamp was there to pick up
the slack—the surging junior picked up
16 first half points on her way to a
season-high 21.

After falling behind 32-28 at the
break, the ‘Cats bounced back with a 6-
0 run to start the second half. Davidson
played a strong second half, with only
six turnovers compared to the first half’ s
14. A Kamp steal and subsequent lay-in
eventually knotted the game at 61 with
1:25 to play. But two turnovers and a
missed jumper in the game’s last 30
seconds allowed UNC-G to ae away
for a 64-61 victory.

“It’s so frustrating to get so close
and then fall just short,” said Jamie
Brown who contributed 9 points and 7
rebounds despite limited playing time
due to a recovering knee injury. “This
was a game we wanted. There’s no
other way to describe it than frustrating
and disappointing.”

“It’s abig disappointment because
it’s ahome game. And we like to think
that we take care of our home court,”
agreed Coach John Filar. “But the posi-
tive thing is that they laid it on the line
tonight, they gave it a fantastic:effort.
We’ ve got to be pleased with that.”

Among the factors in the Cats’
strong showing was the play of senior
Kerry Brown, who had a well-balanced
11 points, five rebounds, and four as-
sists on the night.

Leah Uhernik started for the recu-
perating Jamie Brown, and picked up‘a

team-high nine rebounds along with
her nine points in 27 minutes of court
time. “Big minutes and big time from
Leah Uhernik,” said Filar. “She did a
fantastic job on the boards. She’s just
a point and a rebound away from a
double-double. She came to fight to-
night, and that spread to her team-
mates on the floor.”

Jess Montrella achieved a career
milestone on the evening, scoring her
1000" point in a Wildcat uniform.
“Unfortunately, tonight was more bit-
ter than sweet. I was happy to reach
that milestone but it’s tempered by the
fact that we lost the game and I got into
foul trouble early.”

Though the final dominoes did
not fall their way in the end, Filar’s
Wildcats have renewed confidence in
their ability to run with any team in the
conference. “If we can come out every
game and play with that kind of heart
and desire,” said Jamie Brown, “we're
going to be fine no matter who we’re
matched up against.”

“T feel like we’re going to pull it
out in the end,” said Jess Montrella,
referring to the conference tourna-
ment in late February. “Deep down
inside I just know. It doesn’t really
matter to me what other people say or
what other people think, but I know it
and my teammates know it, too. We
know in our hearts that we’re just as
good or better than anybody in our
conference.”

Swimmers seek Three-Peat at Southern States

By ALISON KALETT

This week, ten Southern Confer-
ence swimming and diving teams will
descend on Davidson’s campus for the
Southern States Championships, to be
held from Wednesday through Satur-
day. Talented squads such as the Uni-
versity of Louisville, Georgia South-
ern, and Western Illinois will be look-
ing to de-throne the two-time defend-
ing champion Wildcats.

According to Head coach Rich
DeSelm the key to a Davidson three-
peat will be continued success in their
stroke, individual medley, and relay
events combined with exceptional per-
formances in their typically weaker
sprinting events.

“We can be a very capable relay
team and surprise some teams, but we’ re
not deep in freestyle sprints, although
we’re a little stronger on the women’s
team,” DeSelm said. “This meet is very
competitive in sprints so where we’re

not deep or strong in sprints we make up
in depth and ability in strokes.”

_ Onthe men’s side, victories in the
swimming events are key as the ‘Cats
will inevitably lose points in men’s div-
ing where lone diver, junior Mark
Medendorp, will continue to face tough
competition from established diving
programs.

“We’ve been concerned about it
(men’s diving) all year long,” DeSelm
said. “With equally as talented divers as
our opponents we would have been 9-
4.” (The ‘Cats finished the season 6-7.)

For the women, diving will help
rather than hinder the ‘Cats efforts as
the trio of junior Elizabeth Fraser, sopho-
more Christa Conner, and freshman Liz
Nugent look to continue their solid sea-
sons.

The women’s squad, however, will
be missing several key swimmers due
to injury. Junior Sharon Riedley is re-
covering from surgery she had in early
January, while fellow junior Suzi
Bozzone will swim only on the non-
scoring team due to a head injury sus-
tained last November.

Leading the ‘Cats efforts will be a
group of six seniors. On the men’s side,
Michael McCabe, Bill Patterson, and
co-captains Jason Prince and Jay
Rosenquest will look to end their
Davidson swimming careers in cham-
pionship fashion. The senior-duo of
Allison Hobgood and Kathleen
Paffenroth will lead the women’s team.

Davidson’s toughest competition
will come from the University of Louis-
ville on the women’s side, while new-
comer Western Illinois and long-time ri-
val Georgia Southern will challenge the
men’s squad. The ‘Cats beat Georgia
Southern by one point earlier this season
and the Eagles will be seeking revenge.

Says freshman Tom Murphy, “We
look strong going into the meet, but we’ re
gonna all have to do our best because we
have good opponents whoare also hungry
for the title.”

“We're the underdog despite being
the defending champions,” DeSelm said.
“Louisville and Georgia Southern look
very strong but I’m confident we’ll be in
the middle of it- it’s up to us.”
