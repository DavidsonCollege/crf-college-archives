There are only 8! shopping
days left until Christmas, 30
Bad Bernard and Bonehead
have decided to avoid the rush,

and go ahead and: present the
1978 individual flickerball lea-

ders in their respective catego-
ries. If you have been chosen,
we would like you to send a ten
dollar donation to the ‘Send
Bernie and Bonehead.to the
World Series” Fund. In return
we will send you a patch with
the seal of Bad Bernard and
Bonehead sitting on the heads
of the Chambermaids. The seal
was especially designed for us
by Dr. Boulton. We don’t like
it, but it’s better than nothing.
If you weren’t named as one of
the best players it is probably
because you are a member of the
wrong religion or race.

Here are the leaders:
Passing—Ron Rosenberg (KA
Gold)—The Rose has completed
59-65 passes this season for
1,027 yards. If he can continue
this pace he is sure to break
Jimmy Jordan’s record set at
Tallahassee Leon High School
in 1976.

Rushing—Jon Stroud (Mac-
Fleet and Stuff)—Jon is doing
an excellent job at rusher and
has dumped the tailback for
losses totaling 173 yards.
Stroud has chased opposing
backs for an average of 2.316

miles per game.

Receiving —This category is be-
ing led by: a freshman girl, but
Bernie went to find out her

name and he hasn't come back:
‘yet. Chalk up another reception
‘for her. :

“Blocking — Mike Britt (Up and

Coming) — Mike has not been
moved from his position this

year; in. fact, he just stands:

there and looks stupid.
Interceptions—Bobby Lapple
(SAE)—We overheard Bobby
in the Union saying that he
already had 17 snags (oskies)
this year. His average return is
17.4 yards, but then who really
cares?

Fumble Recoveries — Scott
Smith (The Hole)—Scotty leads
with seven recoveries, four of
which he fumbled himself.
Tackles—Sterling Martin (Old
Men)—The Napoleon of the
IMAC Empire has already
made 72 unassisted tackles in
four games. Offensive backs
tremble at the thought of
running towards ‘‘Mean Steril.”
Scoring — Bill McKinley (Mas.
Fleet)— Billy has done the best
job of keeping score in the
IMAC Department this year.
So far he has a .893 record of
getting the score right within
the required 95 percent confi-
dence interval.

Spirit— Skip Brown (The Hole)
~—Skippy, alias Mr. Hustle is
not even playing this year, but
if he were you can bet that he
would be playing his ass off. We
talked with the big guy last

night and he. had the following

‘comments: ‘'} just. want the:
people here at Davidson to.

know that I am ready to play,
and that I am bed as Hell.” ‘*

-So much for: the celebrities.
Mighty Fine! OK, now get out
of here, I mean it. °

‘Ye heopleg with our tnvdtlen:
of presenting you a play and a

player of the week, we can

‘horestly say that we have two
beauties for the week of Sept.’

19-26. Our player of the week is
Minor Sinclair for his breath-
taking performance in his
team’s 35-12 victory over the
Four Skins. Sinclair was omni-
present as he ran for 162 yards
and passed for another 200
yards. Chevrolet and Holly
Farms will each give the game
room'a 1,000 dollar gift in Mr.
Sinclair’s honor.

Our Fireman’s Fund Flash-
back play came Sunday: when
the SAE’s did battle with Big
Boa and the Greensnakes. In
pregame warmups, E Tailback
Jim Richards ran out .on a
pattern and when he made his
first cut of the day his Topsider

blew-out and caused injury to'

his subequatorial musele. Jim
was not concerned about the
fact that he will miss the next
few games, but he was dis-
tressed that he tore a brand
spanking new pair of official
SAE khaki pants.

The most exciting games this
week were: 1) ATO forfeit to

debisdat toa tale Gate belplessly. he aqued io curteutiy 26 ane hopes 6 ap Ue econ this

Sunday against a perennially strong Applachain team.

(Gregg Strader)

69’ers, 2) ATO forfeit to Mac-

. Fleet, and 3) ATO forfeit to

ATO.
In other action the Old Men

' (they picked up some guy

named Beedenbacher) de-

Bounced To Be Announced,

26-20, the GDI’s moved in on

Captain Cohab 26-7, The Hole

(just a freshman team, 5-0) put
dirt in PiKA’s face 27-7, and
then plugged the Reamers
where it counts, 25-19.

Hurtin for Certain had a big
week and we have this report
from our Belk Dorm office: ‘‘We
knocked off the Drawbacks,

_ 46-18, and then in the IMAC

game of the week, the compe-
tency of the Bad Bernard and
Bonehead rating system was
proven infallible once again as
#7 Hurtin for Certain circum-
cized the #6 Four Skins, 35-12.
The key play of the closely-
played rout was when 5’2”’ Jeff
(X-Ray) McQuay got up one
more time after a big Home-
coming weekend and took a
pass from a 6’4”’ Italian sausage
by the name of ‘Dramatic Dave’
Tornetta. On offense, Eddie
Haskell, under the auspices of
Ward and June Cleaver, held
his interceptions down to two
and in the process sold young
Beaver (Gee guys) his first dime
bag. You know what we mean,
Joby?”’ Thanks for the news,
guys. ®

In other games the boys of
Up and Coming knocked out

injury

TBA, 20-19, in a squeaker and
the E Bags showed just how
bad the SPE’s. really are, 47-6.
Bryan, Daniel, Mike, and Char-
lie are great guys.

In the minor leagues: High
Anxiety and the Amazing
Greys played into overtime, and.
both teams lost. The Tingalies'
played Srd Cannon and we
forgot who won that one. The
Ruskeller and Red Neck Mo-
thers’ game was supposedly
close, but we didn’t have time
to find out just what the score
was so we'll just say, 4-5.

We have been asked to an-
nounce that the first meeting of
the ‘Gifford Piercy Fan Club”
will be held tonight at 11:30 pm,
in Barry Sachtjen’s room.
Gifford will be there to sign
autographs and hand out glos-
sies, .

And now for the BB and B

Top Ten:
1. SAE (16) 5-0
2. KA (7) 5-0
3. MacFleet (6) 4-0
4. Up and Coming 5-0
5. Hurtin for Certain 4-0
6. Old Men 4-0
7. (tie) Pent. Rowdies (1) 6-0
' (tie) Four Skins 3-1
9. The Hole 5-0
10. TBA 3-2

Feelin’ like a million. Turds
that is. Who said that? H.G.L.
C. Later.

lubbers undefeated

By DAVE PIPER

The Davidson club football
team opened its fall season in
fine fashion over the past two

Sundays, with wins over Le-

noir-Rhyne and Central Pied-
mont Community College.

In their opener Davidson
broke open a 6-6 halftime tie to
score a 20 to 12 victory over
Lenoir Rhyne. Team caftain
“Seymour” Rosenberg got the
Cats on the board first with a
‘Billy Kilmer style halfback

‘option pass” to five-year man

Ken Pollock.
* ‘In the second half the Cais

_ got the ground game moving

with Junior transfer Greg Pe-
ter’s taking it in from up close
and Rosenberg scoring on a
long scamper.

Rosenberg commented after
the game, ‘‘geez, it was at least
a hundred: and ten, maybe a’
hundred and twenty yard run.”’

During last Sunday’s game
against the fine gentlemen from
CPCC, the gridders won with-
out the services of Rosenberg,

who fell off the roof of Duke
during Saturday night’s grain
party. The team was up 16-6 at
the half on the basis of two TD
passes, one by Joby Merton and
one by Rob ‘Really I’m not
Slow” Hull.

In a post-game interview
Merton exclaimed, ‘That was
the only pass I completed all
weekend.”’

Due to the tenacious defense
CPCC scored only three points
in the second half while frosh
Alec Driscoll rushed for a career
record 169 yards to put the
game on ice. The 22-9 defeat
was CPCC’s first in four ou-
tings.

After three away games, the
cats will be at home against
Atlanta Baptist on Saturday,
October 28. Incidentally, At-
lanta is gearing up for NCAA
Division III status in the near
future.

All people are encouraged to .
come out and support the team |
and try for the spirit keg. Due
to ‘‘Mouse’”’ Seller’s absence,
Phil Toye was last week's
winner.
