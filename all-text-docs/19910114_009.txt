another future conflict rather than
prevent such a crisis. To rush to
war is to release a Pandora’s box of
regional geo-political, religious,
and class antagonisms whose ulti-
mate resolution will be unpredict=
able and uncontrolable by the
United States.

Even should the military op-
tion ultimately be exercised, it is
still more prudent, politically and
militarily, to wait until a later date.
More time would actually make
the military option more likely of
rapid success. First, with effec-
tively no new: weapons or spare
parts flowing into Iraq from its
previous arms suppliers, its con-
ventional military capability, both
in terms of equipment and in train-
ing of personnel, will diminish.
Conversely, the preparation of
Allied forces would be increased.
Continued supply of needed equip-
ment, more desert warfare train-
ing, and improved lines of com-
munication between the various
Allied national forces would be to
our military advantage.

Also, growing political ten-'

sions resulting from economic
instability will increase the proba-
bility of disaffected elements of
the Iraqi population (e.g. the Kurds)

openly revolting against or less
enthusiastically supporting the war.
The counter argument, that such
time would mean the Allied coali-
tion would be less enthusiastic and
break up, is simple-minded and
devoid of logic. Can weexpect that
those who would abandon us in
times of peace would be more apt
to support us enthusiastically in
war?
Indeed, there-are-no-guaran-

‘tees that a war with Iraq will be

sufficiently brief to avert the de-
velopment of major anti-war senti-
ments at home and/or preclude
Allied disintegration of support.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee
that war, whether brief or long,
will not be so devastating to Iraq
that, in order to ensure the balance
of power, American forces will be
required to remain for a long,
expensive, and unpopular duration.
Should we then decide that war
is the only and necessary. hand to
play now? There are still other
favorable cards to be dealt. In-
deed, that diplomacy, political
pressure, and an unprecedentedly
effective embargo will secure our
objectives isa gamble. Butitis one
which averts destruction of inno-
cent lives and valuable resources
(i.e. oil) that would surely insue
should war be our course.
Finally, if it is the desire of the
United States to lead the develop-
ment of a new world order, we
must take heed not to act in the

same old manner of being quick to
resolve conflicts through force. The
United States stands today as the
only super-power, but should we
use our full power toward war,
without first securing more equi-
table burden sharing systems, we
will only speed up the day in which
we willlack economic wherewithal
and political will toeffectively lead
the world in securing vital inter-
ests into the future. We should be

,wary of overplaying our hand

whereby securing our short term
objectives, we unwittingly sacri-
fice our long term interests in the
Middle East and the world. Quite
frankly, if the United States de-
Sires to maintain its position of
world leadership in the emerging
new world order, it must be more
than just a military leader, but a
creative moral, diplomatic, politi-
cal, and economic one as well.
War isnotan option, but rather
the final, the desparate, and the
tragic last resort undertaken when
all other possiblities for resolving
crisis have been thoughtfully.pur-

sued and thoroughly exhausted.

Simply stated: war has only one
definite outcome: death. If we go
to warand defeat Iraq militarily (as
we unquestionably will do), we
will forever ask ourselves: did
anybody really win? It will be a
question of even more bitter be-
wilderment should we know that
humane alternatives went unex-
plored.

Housing
Continued from Page 7

last year (creating enough tension),
now there are three. Were once we
sought academic asylum in the
“fishtanks” of Belk and
Richardson, our lounges are now
ad hoc dorm rooms. I give
Davidson kudos for altering the
old PAX house for homeless ten-
ants. These methods of ecomo-
mizing living space a Davidson
are dignified efforts, but as you
squeeze more peiple into less space,
the price is usually paid in tension
and frustration. Furthermore, if the
people in “triples” are allowed
better numbers next year (I am in
complete agreement with this pol-
icy), and more triples are expected
each year, and we are not planning
any new housing, where does that
leave those with better than aver-
age lottery numbers? They are
averaged down and become num-
bers that could easily force.some-
one to live off-campus.

Again, | feel thatthe real prob-
lem is that the community of
Davidson does not have the capa-
bility of housing all of these dorm-
less students. During the summer
of my freshman year I was onthe
wait-list at Davidson until mid-
June (and the wait was well worth
it). Asarising-sophomore, I waited
until mid-July to find an apartment
in the area. It was actually sug-
gested that I live in someone’s
basement in Mooresville. I am
willing to sacrifice convenience
for attending Davidson, but will I
be forced into making that deci-
sion (and will you?) just because
of a lack of planning? It was a
matter of chance (and shrewd bar-
gaining) that I am living where I
am living today. Frankly, I would
like to avoid going through an-
other summer with transfer appli-
cations on my dresser.

The life of the off campus stu-
dent is different. How might the
Honor Code suffer if great por-
tions of the student body live out-
side of school boundries? Ihave no
doubt that some aspects of the Code
are suspended in amber when one
takes two steps off campus. Fur-
ther, support from the Davidson
police only extends to off campus
students in a second-hand way.
The officers cannot patrol the
neighborhoods of off-campus stu-
dents as they do on-campus dor-
matories, As thugs from Charlotte
read about “the school that keeps
their doors unlocked,” they begin
to move their activities to
Davidson. My roommate and! have
little trust in our neighborhood: I
sleep with a Louisville Slugger
under my bed. .
_ I feel that Davidson has no
planned adequately for off-cam-
pus students. We are equal when
paying our tuition, but not in real-
ity. Such students undergo a cer-
tain alienation. Such students must
try doubly hard -- just because
Davidson is deficient -- to main-

tain a life on-campus with friends.
I belong to an eating house ahd go
out every weedend, but I feel I

..have lost much of the camaraderie
of last year’s hall antics because I
do not share a hall with close
friends.

This is not to say that living
off-campus is bad for every one.
There is even a wait list (ugh!) for
permission to live off campus.
Many have found ita great way of
getting down to studies, away from
the hall’s distractions. Now, dur-
ing finals, I do sometimes appreci-
ate the quiet and privacy of my
own room. However, waitand live
off campus while attending a re-
markable-school, or go to another.

Davidson, N.C. isno megopo-
lis teeming with real estate; it is a
tiny community that buckles under
the tensions of a growing college.
It seems to me there needs to be
more communication between
Residence Life and Admissions:
there will one day be a limit (if ita
hasn’t already been streched) to
how many students you can
squeeze into a room. There must
be an appeal to the trustees to pro-
vide more housing (scrap the new
parking lot?). In contrast to some
colleges, freshman have cars on
campus. (This is a privilege not a
right.) Perhaps more dorms could
be built on the space made avail-
able by removing this privilegé.

The college could also make
serious efforts to stimulate a mar-
ket for affordable off-campus liv-
ing. There remains a great lack of
rooms in Davidson and Cornelius
(obviously not in Mooresville).
Campus police could also devote
more attention to off-campus stu-
dents’ needs. A map marked with
off-campus students’ homes might
be good, and the police should
additionally - patrol Davidson’s
WDAV back-road: this is a bee-
line for most off-campus students
returning from late night studying
or parties. More importantly, po-
lice mustensure that drunk driving
does not occur. Many students opt
to drive home from a night of fes-
tivities instead of staying in a
friend’s room.

No one seems to know who is
responsible for dealing with
Davidson’s growth. Whether we
become a “Micro-Emory,” seems
to be up to Admissions. Whether
we graduate with four students per
square inch appears to be left off
the agenda of the Trustees. For
those who attend Davidson with
no problems with off-campus liv-
ing, I salute you, I envy you, and I
would love to meet your connec-
tions. Butif Davidson continues to
grow without better planning, the
quality of student life will suffer.
Are we helpless? Come lottery
time, that question will be an-
swered. I begin to wonder if I have
aplace at Davidson. It is apparent
that Davidson does not have a bed
for me.

more studying abroad this semes-
ter.
