Prof. Foreman Attends
Big Atlanta Conference

Religious Education Association
Discusses Religious Problems
in Present Economic Crisis
at Meeting

From April 15 to 17, Professor Foreman,
professor of Bible and philosophy at David-
son, was in Atlanta, Ga., attending the an-
nual national meeting of the Religious Edu-
cation Association. This meeting, held at

| the Central Congregational Church, was at-

tended by representatives from Jewish, Ro-
man Catholic, and Protestant churches. The
discussion was centered about the general
problem of religion in the présefit economic
crisis. 3

The conference was divided into three dis-
cussion groups, the first of which was com-
posed of representatives from colleges and
universities throughout the United States.
he second group was made up of represen-
tdtives from the churches. The third was
composed of business men who represented
the economic interests of the United States.
Professor Foreman was in the first discus-
sion group, but he managed to hear some
of the other discussions.

The conference included four general ses-
sions at which prominent men spoke on the
general subject of the social implications of
religion. In speaking of the conference, Pro-
fessor Foreman says, “One of the most in-

| teresting impressions was the harmony be-

tween the representatives of various religions
in the social and ethical ideals.”

pointed out that heredity and environment
might be similar, but that each persofiality
was different from the other. He continued
that God worked out this plan for a definite
purpose. The speaker reminded the audience
that this is his first year as “Y” secretary,
and thanked those who have helped him, and
asked for their support and prayers in the
future. He urged the students to rededicate
and consecrate their lives to a new fellow-
ship with the Eternal Father.

Following this speech, the gathering bowed
its head and held a period of silent prayer.
An improvised stairway led up on the stage
from the auditorium and after the list of the
