The Davidsonian

Fast food thrives

Editor’s note: This is the first of
several articles dealing’ with nu-

trition at Davidson. Students at
Davidson have several’ “eating a

options, including the fast fooas
of Slater, vegitarianism at 'se-

veral houses, and the challenge |

of cooking on one’s own. The
Davidsonian would like to ex-
amine these various options.
The first article.concerns nutri-
tion at’ARA -Slater and “fast
food” at Davidson.

How do you handle a Big Mac
Attack at Davidson? Head for
the Snack Bar to get a Wildcat
Special of course.

The snack bar provides the
“fast-food’”’ on campus. It is
possible to eat a balanced meal
there; however, vegetables are a
problem. Salads are the only
option.

A greater percentage (7012)
of the freshmen eat in Richards
and Bailey than in the snack
bar. This is understandable

‘since the $1.75 limit of the meal
card has more net worth in the
two houses.

Slater does try to keep: the

prices at the snack bar lower
than those of the outside mar-
ket. Many students prefer to
eat at the snack bar over
Hardee’s or Harmon’s since the
food is cheaper and also easier
to get to.

Reasons given by freshmen
for eating at the snack bar vary.
“The food is good for a snack
bar.’’ ‘‘Sometimes Slater is
really bad!” ‘It’s a change of
pace.” “‘The-snack bar. offers a
wider variety.”

Breakfast seems to be the
most popular time to eat in the
snack bar. Students with after-
noon classes prefer to ‘‘sleep
late and eat after ten.”

Although the breakfast foods

may be obtained by writing:

can be considered ‘‘fast foods,’’
they are nutritional. One nutri-

‘tional breakfast within the meal
‘card limit includes eggs, toast,

grits, sausage and. a small

‘orange juice. Another option is
* cereal with milk; an order of
‘sausage or ham, and a small

orange juice with money left for
a danish or a couple of donuts.

The snack bar and its fast
foods are also popular ‘‘for late
night snacks’’ and with stu-
dents who have ‘“‘the mun-
chies!’’ When some eating hous-
es on Patterson Court don’t
serve a weekend meal, many of
the students eat at ‘the snack
bar.

Whether the student at Da-
vidson eats a balanced meal at
Slater depends on his know-
ledge of nutrition. The daily
nutritional requirements are of-
fered in a variety of ways but
the choice remains the stu-
dent’s.

A nutritional fast food lunch
or dinner under $1.75 is the
wildcat special with lettuce and
tomatoe, a salad and milk.
Another choice could be soup,
the ham and cheese sandwich on
rye with a glass of lemonade.

When asked if Slater has
considered switching to a more
profitable fast-food oriented
menu at Richards and Bailey,
Ron Scott replied no. Any basic
changes made in the menu are
based on the popular item
against the nonpopular one.

“One upcoming menu change
is the removal of corn beef and
cabbage as an entree since the
students don’t eat it,” said Ron
Scott. ‘‘The corn beef will
probably be used in reuben
sandwiches in the future.’’ In
this instance, the entree change
is towards a popular sandwich

type food. But the students, not’

Slater, decided on this minor
move towards fast foods.

CLEMENT GREENBERG, the visiting Reynolds Lecturer and art critic assesses art in a very

individualistic manner.

(Gregg Strader)

Greenberg invites us to look

By MERIDETH DURDEN
Features Editor

“The kind of criticism that

‘interests me is where value

judgments abound,’’ stated
Clement Greenberg. ‘‘Where
value judgments don’t abound,
I loose interest.”

Greenberg, _ internationally
respected art critic and visiting
Reynolds lecturer, uses a very
personal approach when evalua-
ting art. When asked what de-
termines good art he answered
quickly, “I don’t know, but I
can tell. It’s as mysterious as
recognizing the color one in the
sky.”

This individualistic ct
to assessing art is reflected in
Greenberg’s method of teaching
art appreciation.

“I would not ask anyone to
analyze a painting in teaching
art appreciation,” Greenberg
explained. I would just ask the
student to point out which pic-
ture, out of several in a room, he
or she liked the best.._Then
Greenberg would point out the
one he preferred and ‘‘we’d go to
another room and choose again.
We'd keep doing it. Then later
I'd tell you something irrele-
vant.”

The “‘irrelevant”’ information
includes factors that people
mistakenly believe have some-
thing to do with the effect of
art. The Impressionists and
their use of complementary

colors is the example Greenberg
gave for this misconception. He
believes that such techniques
can be used with a bad picture
as well as a good one. “It has
nothing to do with explaining
the effect of a picture,’’ he
stated.

Greenberg’s very strong feel-
ings about ‘‘good’’ art over
“bad”’ art have caused him to be
labeled ‘‘reactionary.’’ But he
senses that there is ‘‘steady
pressure of a lowering of stan-
dards”’ in art and he fights this.

When asked to explain this
idea of good over bad art by
commenting on what is quality
in art, Greenberg again offered
a highly individualistic expla-
nation. ‘‘It (quality) is the
reason we choose to remember
Shakespeare and not Philip
Morris. It’s why we hang Rem-
brandt and leave many other
Dutch artists of his time out.

It’s why we like one rock and.

roll song more than another.
That’s good and bad. Or, at
least, it’s better and worse.”
Greenberg became an art
critic “out of presumption.’ I
could draw. I felt I know art
from the inside so I could write
about it. I found out I didn’t
know as much as I thought.”
However, he believes that expe-
riencing art is the only way to
improve art criticism tech-

niques and Greenberg has been
at it for about thirty years.
Greenberg sees the function
of an a‘t critic.as one of calling
attent on to things. “I point out
what is good, what is overra-

ted,’ he elaborated. He does

this by stating te re and
generating copy.

As an art critic Glsaiidiy is
aware of the fact that the notion

" of high culture itself is under at-

tack. The implication, he be-
lieves, is that the ruling classes
impose low culture on the lower
classes. ‘‘There’s nothing in my
experience falser than that,” he
stated.
Greenberg thinks good cul-
ture is open to all. ‘“The truth is
that the majority has never
really been deprived: of good
art,’’ Greenberg explained.
“What we call popular culture
appeared as something de-
signed for the market but was
dependent on the market. The
mass market could pay for what
it wanted. The mass market got
what it wanted.”

Greenberg stands firm on his
belief that ‘‘Nothing is forced on
anybody.” He-sees his role as
an art critic as one of stating his
personal reaction but not
““You’re always inviting. the
reader to look for himself,’’
Gre. aberg explained.
