PORTS
POTLIGHT

BY JIM JACKSON

It may be a little late to be writing about basket-
ball. but it’s never too late to write about fighting ©
spirit—typical Davidson fighting spirit: A lot of people
at the tournament had heard a lot about. the Wildcat
spirit and still were skeptical when the ’Cats took the
floor against a highly-favored George Washington
quintet last Friday night. They realized exactly what
the will to win means, and a great number of Davidson
students were reminded of it in a manner which they
will never forget. The ’Cats didn’t win—no, but they
had more to be proud of .in losing than they might
ever have gained by winning. It was another moral
victory for Davidson, but not of the traditional variety.
This was a new type and it showed the nation’s experts
just what kind of basketball a team from a little school
in North Carolina is capable of playing.

Unfortunately, the annals of Southern Conference sports
history won't record that battle too strongly. The championship

is what counts.

performance of Tommy

But one thing they will record: the individual
Peters and his unanimous choice as

forward on the All-tourney team and trophy award as the Most
Valuable Player. Only a war could keep Tommy and George
from becoming the outstanding pair of athletes in the country.

In musing over the possibilities for Davidson’s
future greatness in the sports world, the possibility of
the introduction of swimming and boxing teams was
brought to mind. Once peace has again descended on
the world and sports are back to their normal status,
the proposed new gymnasium of spléndor and car¢@-zity
should be completed with its many and varied facilities.
A tank team to rival that of Carolina’s famed Blue
Dolphins, current Conference title-holders, and the
reinstatement of inter-collegiate boxing into the Pres-
byterian domain would be welcomed by more than one
party. With the advent of increased training programs
in peacetime for perpetual preparedness strengthens

this hope.

(One of the nation’s leading weeklies carried an article on
Walter Driggs,owner of the Detroit Tigers, major league cid,
hailing him as the game of baseball's number one fan, It’s the

story of a wealthy magnate who realized his boyhood dreams

and made his ballclub a pleasure for fandom and not a lucrative
proposition. Most of the South’s baseball will probably come
from magazines this summer. War is, indeed, horrible.

Slipping back to basketball for a moment, it is
notable to see that Appalachian’s fine cage crew, led
and coached by the famed Belus Smawley, were invited
to Kansas City and the National Intercollegiate playoff
as champions of the North State. After the lickings
they gave Catawba this year, the Mountaineers might
have too well had they been in the recent Southern
tourney. It is also rather interesting to note that Tom
Peters is probably the first Davidson athlete to be be-
seiged by autograph hunters and asked to speak over

the radio as a celebrity.

A position of creditable work, but little reward is that of

a-freshman Davidsonian writer. Those frosh who have been
turning out patiently for sports include Bobby Phillips, Jimmy
Alexander, Bob Thurston, and Shep Dunn. With little hope of
advancement due to the military situation, their's is the part of

a rear gunner

in actual combat.

With the end of the basketball season the intra-
fraternity sports program swings into the last leg
in the trophy race. The Betas, by virtue of their-fine
showing both in football and on the court rank as fav-
orites to cop the cup. However, volleyball and softball
always play important,roles in the point standings, just
as important as those of the earlier sports. The annual
track meet, a proving ground for freshmen stars
comes up soon. Last year’s trophy winners, the K.A.’s,
won neither football nor basketball, but placed high
in the meet, went undefeated in volleyball and won the
softball title to carry top honors.

Arthur Daley, successor to brainy John Kieran as sports
editor of, the New York Times, writes in his Sunday column
of the hospitality and respect which the Americans and others
received in the 1936 Olympic Games in-Berlin. The sports writ-
ers would play a game among*them$elves; based on the usage
of pass and passport to get into the contests, and counting off
so many points for the usage of, either or both, The Germans
then treated all foreigners as honored guests. Perhaps these

same athletes and- writers may enter the heart

of the Nazi

stronghold before long, and enjoy respect once more, though
hospitality will hardly be present. That isn’t a forecast, that’s

premonition. And that’s all.

Betas and Phi Delts Tied
In Frat Basketball League

Intramural basketball continued
last week with the scheduled games,
although there was some mix-up due
to the fact that many students left
to witness the Varsity’s stellar per-
formance at Raleigh. Several con-
tests run off, despite
and they "packed

were
ponements,

post-
the

usual spirit that accompanies intra-°

frat ball.

The Spees managed to triumph
over a Kappa Sig fivesome to the
tune-of 32-27, the K.A.’s rolled over
the hapless Pikas, 23-17, and the
Betas trounced the Pi Kaps. The
SAE-Phi Delt match was cancelled,
pending the return of absent broth-
ers.

In Monday’s frays of this week;
the battles were hot and two of the
most startling upsets of the year
were pulled, The undefeated and
high-flying Betas fell before an
inspired Phi Delt outfit, 25-17, and
the hitherto victory-starved Pikas
pulled one out of the bag to hand
the favored Fijis a 38-21 licking. In
an afternoon affair, the SAE’s came
out on the long end of a 15-12 count
with the K.A’s.

Interest has mounted high in the
fraternity struggles, and with the
possibility of winning the coyeted
intramural trophy: hanging in the
balance, all quints are playing their
hearts out. Only two more rounds of
play are remaining in the annual
race.

Each year in the campus cage
tourney numerous stars, some. of
them of varsity calibre, are produced
and display amazing proficiency on
the hardwood. Then, as an unlimited
source of strengthening physical
training the basketball league has
no equal in the intramural field.

that would have payed off nine
times out of ten, the ’Cats chose to
