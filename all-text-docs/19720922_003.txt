WELCOME TO DAVIDSON

Union Will Highlight 1950's,
Prison System During Year

By JOHN CASSELS
Asst. Features Editor

Programs on assorted themes
will highlight activities of the
College Union during its first
year in temporary facilities.

“The Union programs will try
to carry some sense of con-
tinuity through the year,” said
Peter Sterling, director of the
College Union.

A 50’s theme will start the
year with a visit by Allen Gin-
sburg during Homecoming
Week. On Oct. 23 he will speak
on the ‘Literary Development
of the Beat Generation.”’ Also
that week will be a fine film
featuring James Dean and a
sock-hop in the gym.

Another program will focus
on the prison system in the U.S.
Ramsey Clark, former attorney
general and author of ‘‘Crime in
America,"’ will visit campus for
three days in January. Other
speakers from around the coun-
try will visit throughout the
year. .

On Oct. 11, former inmates of
San Quentin will visit sociology
and psychology classes. That
night they will present ‘The
Cage,” a play written, directed
and performed by ex-cons.

In March there will be a
program on the examination of
the delivery of health care in
the United States.

“We're getting adjusted to
new facilities, trying to build
the best program we can, and
examining the possibilities for a
new union,” said Sterling.

THE DAVIDSONIAN
staff will hold its first
organizational meeting
for the year Sunday night
at 9:30 p.m. in the

newspaper offices on the
second floor of the Union.

All freshmen and up-
perclassmen interested in
joining the staff are in-
vited to attend. No prior
journalism experience is

necessary.
Staff positions are
available in news and
sports reporting,
photography, advertis-
ing, and _ circulation.
Anyone interested in par-
ticipating on various in-
vestigative teams, as well
as those who want to do
cartoon or artwork,
should also come to the
Sunday night meeting.

After the old Union was torn
down in June, the Union was
moved to the guest house.

Inside the new facility, offices
are located on the main floor,
game rooms and the bar are in
the basement, and three
meeting rooms and the David-
sonian offices are located on the
second floor.

On top of moving woes, the
Union Board has had to undergo
a change in leadership. Stan
Hassinger, Union’ Board
president, has left Davidson to
attend Johnson C. Smith
University.

Jim Campbell, this year's
social chairman and first vice
president of the Union Board, is
now functioning as Union Board
president.

Sterling emphasized that the
activities this year would be
low-pressure, informal affairs.
The second annual All-Campus
Beer Party will be Sept. 30 on
the baseball field, featuring
free beer and several groups.

The idea is to bring freshmen
and upperclassmen together

with their dates and a chance to
get to know each other in an in-

Play Tryouts
To Start Soon

Auditions for Davidson's first
drama _ production of the
year,’*The School for Scandal,”
will be held Sunday, Sept. 24
and Monday, Sept. 25 at 7:30
p.m. in Hodson Hall.

Rupert Barber. drama
professor and director of the
play, invited all students, with
or without experience, to try out
for the English comedy's 15
male and 5 female roles.

According to Barber, the
auditions will consist of reading
scenes from the Sheridan play,
copies of which are available
from Barber's office.

“I try to make the tryouts as
comfortable and unpressured
as possible,’’ Barber said.

Barber described the play,
which will be done in 18th cen-
tury period, as an “actor's
play,” with very good and
balanced leads, excellent
smaller ‘character’ parts, and
few menial ‘‘Here is your hat,
sir.” roles.

“The roles are open to all
students and none have been
cast," Barber said.

Rehearsals will begin im-
mediately for the play, which is
scheduled for presentation Nov.
1-4.

formal atmosphere.

Special nights, such as a
freshman night or coed night,
will be held. The Hungry d is
also back for another year.

Many more popular films are
planned for this year, with two
or more nights a week booked.
Sterling also said that the Fine
Film series this year is one of
the finest Davidson has ever
had.

Throughout the year the
Union Board will be developing
proposals for a new _ union
facility. A questionnaire will
soon be distributed to students,
faculty and staff on the type
facilities they would like in a
new union.

‘We are trying to prove you
can have a good union program
when you don’t have a Union.”
Sterling concluded, *‘We wantto
show that we can have a
program even though we need
new facilities.”

The college Union will hold a
straw poll next Wednesday to
gauge political opinions on the
Davidson campus.

Students and faculty will be
able to cast votes for either
President Richard M. Nixon or
Sen. George Mc Govern in

polling places at the Post Office
and Chambers.

Orientation Revised

To Help Freshmen

By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

Traditional orientation for
new Davidson students had a
few new twists this year under
the supervision of Dean of
Students Will Terry and Fresh-
man Class Advisors Skip
Holcomb and Rob Krebs.

Terry stressed the need ‘‘to
build community among fresh-
men right from the start,’’ and
Holcombe emphasized im-
proving faculty advisor-student
relations and learning how to
work with other students.

To accomplish these goals,
changes were made, such as
making official the traditional
supper with faculty advisors,
all of which were held Monday
evening.

Another new project was the
Freshman Regatta, for which
each freshman hall was given
money to build a boat and race
it against other halls on Lake
Norman on Wednesday af-
ternoon.

For entertainment, the hall
counselors provided a skit for
the freshmen and their parents
on Saturday night, and the
freshmen produced a variety
talent show Tuesday evening.

The traditional tour of the
library was replaced by ‘‘The
Library Game,” in which room-
mates paired up to test how well
they could find their way
around the library.

Another innovation was the
Academic Fair, designed to
complement the Activities Fair.
‘‘We wanted to familiarize the
new students with both the
larger and the more obscure
major fields,’’ said Krebs.
Professors and upperclassmen
from most departments were
available to answer freshmen
inquiries.

‘We plan to stay visible and
active all year, especially
working with the hall coun-
selors. We'll just handle
whatever comes up,’ Holcomb
said.

‘“‘My only complaint about
orientation was the treatment
of the girls. Davidson isn’t
really prepared to understand
the coeds. We didn't have
anything especially for the girls

delay in having them printed."

alone, wich may be how it
should be,’’ Holcombe con-
tinued.

Holcombe added, ‘‘I wasn’t at
all happy when a number of
football players left early from
Dick Clay’s talk on the Honor
System."’ He said that he had
understood they were not ex-
pected for practice until later.

SGA President Ralph Peeples
addressed the new students
Monday on student govern-
ment. He called for the fresh-
men to join in and to ‘‘keep
plugging away”’ for the college
to redeem its promisses of ex-
cellence in all areas of student
life.

Peeples called for a Women’s
Committee to help solve the
problems of being a Davidson
coed, and for involvement in
helping the ‘‘other’’ residents of
Davidson who ‘“‘find themselves
on the wrong side of the
tracks.”

Freshman John Taylor felt
that orientation was too long
with too much spare time. ‘‘The
activities have been helpful, but
I would have enjoyed more
athletic competition like foot-
ball and basketball."’

Another freshman, Ernest
Glenn, said that he liked orien-
tation. ‘I've had a time to rest
without being too bored, just a
little lonesome sometimes."

"72 Yearbook
At Publishers

Davidson upperclassmen
should be able to obtain a copy
of the 1972 edition of the student

yearbook, the ‘‘Quips and
Cranks", in the ‘immediate
future’’, according to

publication editor Ron Conoley.

“I talked to the publishers
Tuesday,’ said Conoley, ‘‘And
while they couldn’t give me any
specific date, it should be within
about two weeks.”’

The reason for the book's
delay was ‘‘mostly§ a
photographic problem" stated
Conoley. *‘All of the pictures
were taken, but there was a big
