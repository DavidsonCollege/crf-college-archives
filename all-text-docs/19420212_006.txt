Treasurer, taught the lesson at
last Sunday’s College Sunday
Class in .Phi Hall at 10:15
A.M.

Following a brief devotional sery-
ice conducted by Bill Tyson, Mr.
Jackson addressed the group on
“Spiritual Resources.” The talk
was filled with much helpful ad-
to students drawn from the
experience of the speaker’s

life.

Many interesting points
brought to the attention *of those
who attended. “College is a lab-
ortaory of life where the students
should practice Christian living,”
said Mr. Jackson. He went on to
say that later life only magnifies
the problems and questions that are
faced in College.

has been unsettled and
fluctuating for many years. All
this time the Southern Association
of Colleges and Secondary Schools
“labored unremittingly for
reasonable uniformity in standards
of achievement as the basis for the

Conditions Improved

In the early part of this century
it was possible to obtain a bache-
lor's degree from a bona fide col-
lege after only one or two years of
work. Consequently the public, as
well as the+students themselves,
were in doubt as to just what a
bachelor’s degree meant. It has not
been until recently that this unfor-
tunate set of circumstances — has
been eliminated to a large degree.

Such a proposition has been
advanced as a result of the present
world crisis. Howeveg, the Associa-
tion “deplores any proposal, particu-

award the bachelor’s degree at the
close of the junior college or of the
sophomore year after only two years
of college beyond the secondary
school.”

It is apparent that if such a res-
olution were to pass that we would
be once more in the same deplorable
situation that it has taken us some
fifty years to essay an escape.
