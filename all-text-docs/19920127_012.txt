“Lack of Insight”

By B.J. Rudell
In your eyes, I see myself
In two different places;
Two sets of eyes stare mockingly in my direction:
“Why are you alone?” they ask.
I do not like what I see:
Two mouths that quiver when they try to speak,
Two noses that look too big for each face,
Four arms that hang limp, skinny and weak,
Four legs that would rather mun to another place.
I hear your soft voice,
and the images laugh dishonestly;
I smell your sweet breath,
and the figures sigh in ecstasy;
Why are they making fun of me?
I try to shoo them with the balls of my eyes;
They glare angrily back at me:
“We will not leave ‘till you do,” they cry.
In your eyes, the figures loom larger;
They grow with your every syllable whispered,
And the syllables slow down,
And the sounds become barely audible.
And now the four eyes are not simply staring,
They are digging a hole in my mind,
They are groping for a soul they cannot find.
Gradually, they disappear,
They take your eyes with them;
I do not see what else they steal,
For my eyes close as well.

We are but two blind souls,
Digging and groping,
Trying to make ourselves whole.

“Ideas”

By B.J. Rudell

On my numerous visits to foreign lands,
I’ve believed there is an endless universe,
and the ignorance of those I’ve seen
has come, you'll see, to be their curse

(in this vast and endless universe).
By confronting someone with knowledge
on what my concept is all about,
he does not lash out, thrash out, because
in the concept he is already immersed.
But when I give an opinion on matter
to which someone is unfamiliar,
that someone becomes threatened, and

; (it’s soon evident)

a misunderstanding lurks. ,

I met a buffalo, 4000 B.C.,
and I said in a voice well-rehearsed:

“You are not dominant on this land,

for there is Man elsewhere on earth.”
The unleamed beast, it became threatened

. and started to snarl at me:

“You fib, you lie, you feed me untruths...”
but I assured it once more of its worth.

And off I went through the endless universe....

I met a Roman, 100 B.C.,
and asked if he knew about Man;

“Why, yes, “ he explained, “I know of them all:

those who are pale and those who are tan.”

And he smiled.

I warmed him there is no reason for happiness,
and that he shouldn’t feel so clever:

“Your country shall one day be defeated;

empires do not last forever.”
The uneducated tyrant, he filled with spite,
and started to glare at me:

You fleer, you jeer, you scoff, you mock....”
but I told him to insult me never.

And off I went through the endless universe.....

I met an historian, 1992 A.D.,
and asked if he knew about empires that fall;

“Why, yes,” he answered, “I know of them all,

like the Romans, the Greeks, and insects that crawl.”

: And he smiled.

I warmed him that he shouldn’t be smug,
for he is far from being all-knowing:

“People get stupid as they get older,

your brain activity is slowing.”

The uninformed snob, his face had tumed red,
and he gave me a shot in the jaw:

“You dolt, you dunce, you insult my presence...”
but I told him I better be going.

And off I went through the endless universe....

When I got home from all these journeys,
my day’s activities were ended,
and | learned that a new idea can be dangerous
when it is told to someone for whom it is intended.
But suddenly my thoughts were halted,
as a strange apparition appeared!

“The universe,” it stated, “does have and end,”
and I quickly became quite offended.

“You witless, mindless moron,” I cried;

“how can you say such a thing?”

“Ahh,” it said calmly, “you are a fool:
The rule of ideas for you, too, is intended.”

And off it went through the endless universe.
