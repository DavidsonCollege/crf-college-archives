Women’s soccer beats UNCC, falls to Wake

By MEGHAN CuRTIS

If anything, women’s soccer’s loss to No.
21 Wake Forest last Sunday has only made
them more determined to make this season a
success.

Starting out the year with a loss
in their exhibition game against
the University of South Carolina
Gamecocks, the ’Cats stepped up
for a comeback win against UNC
Charlotte.

Regular play began last Friday
against the 49ers (0-1). This win
marks the first time in its history
that Davidson has beaten UNCC
on their home turf, and it was only
its second win ever against the
team, with the first one last year at
Davidson.

The Wildcats started the game
off strong by scoring early in the .
first period with a sister-to-sister
play. Kara Koehrn ’06 assisted sis-
ter Kristen Koehrn ’08 on the first
goal of the evening.

The goal was made with 20:21
left in the first period from about
five yards out. UNCC responded
quickly with a goal of their own.

Just 11 seconds after UNCC’s
response, Kara Koehrn scored an
unassisted goal to lead the ’Cats to
their victory.

The second half of the game
remained scoreless.

“The team looked very strong

and confident against such a large school,
which was very encouraging,” Kara Koehrn
said. “That game will give us a good start
headed into a tough beginning of the Season
schedule.”

On Sunday, the team competed against
Wake Forest.

The ’Cats started out strong, playing tough

Deacons’ first goal was scored with 23:15

goal of the half was scored by the opposing
team with 11:13 left to play.

The second half remained scoreless until
Wake Forest posted a goal with 29:12 left in
the second half.

They followed 10 minutes later with their
final goal.

Davidson’s only goal was
scored by midfielder Cady
Blackey ’06 off of a corner kick
by Jessica Lahre 07 with 4:59
left in the second half.

Wake won the game with a 5-
1 decision. “The score didn’t
truly reflect the opportunities
we created,” said coach Greg
Ashton.

“Although we lost, it was an
opportunity to get some of our
first year students out on the
field,” he said. “It was good to
expose them to a high level of
play early in their collegiate
careers.”

“We know what we’re up
against, but we are going to
play to compete, and hopefully
those games will make us
quicker, smarter players to get
us ready for our Southern
Conference games,” said Kara
Koehrn.

Davidson will travel to chal-
lenge the University of North
Carolina, Duke, Kent State and
Northwestern before returning
home to play against UNC
Wilmington on Sept. 16.
