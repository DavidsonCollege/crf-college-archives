OATH

(Continued From Page One)
Dr. G. L. Abernethy, in at-
tendance at the Wednesday
night meeting, sald that he
felt “a goodly number” of the
entire faculty is opposed to a
public commitment ceremony.
He added that any oath ‘would
hurt Davidson in its competi-
tion with other schools for top-
notch faculty members.
“There has already been a
number of cases where people
have turned us down and said
the vow was the only reason or
one of only two or three rea-
sons.”’ he said. “I don’t think
the vow has been a real handi-
cap in the past 10 years in get-
ting good men; but due to the
increasing competition among
colleges, I think it will increas-

ingly be a handicap in the next,
10."
Dr. W. G. Workman praised
the Trustees who met with the
faculty: “I have never felt that
there was a better understand-
ing between trustees and faculty
than at that meeting Wednesday
night.”

Both Abernethy and Workman
have taken the old oath.

Even the bitterest enemies of
any type of oath at Davidson
seemed encouraged that the
Trustees decided to study the
oath even more before making
a final decision. Commented Dr.
Ernest F. Patterson. ‘I think

the no action this time is a good
sign. Perhaps it means. in the
end they will get rid of the oath
entirely.”

Snow, Snider Win
D. G. Martin Award

Ron Snow and Britt Snider
received the D. G. Martin Jour.
nalism Award at the annual
DAVIDSONIAN banquet. held in
the Morrison Room of the Col-
lege Union ‘last Tuesday night.
Each spring the award is pre-
sented to the outstanding staff
reporter during the school year;
however, this is the first year
two. writers have won the honor.

Snider is a sophomore and has
written for the paper for two
years. Snow, a freshman, has
been appointed News Editor by
the new Editor-in-Chief, Charles
Dibble.

Outgoing Editor David Stitt
spoke briefly on the accomplish-
ments of his staff and commend-
ed them for their work during
the past year.

Health and Physical Education.
The problem referred to by the
‘it’ is perhaps the most deli-
cate and carefully guarded of
all affairs with which the Trus-
tees deal.

And yet a small group of
men who compose the Health
and Physical Education Com-
mittee. and at the same fime the
Athletic Council, continuously
keep their demands for a big-
ger and better athletic program
before the Trustees and con-
stantly request Martin and the
school administration to raise
more money for athletics or to
divert to athletics money used
in other phases of the school.

Trustee committees are actu-
ally much like those of the Sen-
ate, and a few men with senior-
ity can hold power over a large
majority. an administrator re-
ports. In the case of athletics,
Sparrow is joined by two other
committeemen, D. R. LaFar of
LaFar Mills in Gastonia and
John I, Smith, vice president of
Abney Mills in Travelers Rest,
S. C. The strongest voice be-
hind the committee and those
favoring championship football
belongs to a Durham physician,
James F. Hendrix. All four of
these trustees are members of
the powerful Executive Commit-
tee.

At the Trustee meeting in Feb-
ruary, the football supporters
took up a large amount of time
in presenting what one source
close to the Trustees calls ‘‘a
crash program for winning in
football.”

One source reports that the
amount of money being contem-
plated by the proponents of a
crash program is $100,000. Mar-
tin said that while football was
considered at some length. no
specific sum was mentioned at
the meeting. “The whole prob-
lem was referred back to the
committee in charge of athlet-
ics,” he commented.

Sparrow affirmed that his
committee brought up foot-
ball, as well as other parts of
the athletic program, but add-
ed that no concrete proposals
were made. “We hope, how-
ever, that something will de-
velop atong the lines of foot-
ball next year.”

Nothing was done about foot-
ball at the meeting yesterday;
Sparrow's committee merely
presented a routine report on
the state of athletics.

While Sparrow would not in-
dicate the action he hoped to
propose next year, he would talk
about some of the ways he
thinks the athletic program here
can be improved. He said that
increased scholarships [in foot-
ball and perhaps some new ones
to subsidize sports now receiv-

ing no aid are in order.

“As it is now, the amount of
scholarships in football and bas-
ketball (the only two sports Da-
vidson subsidizes) depends upon
the amount of the Living Endow-
ment (money donated to the col-
lege) for immediate use," he
explained. ‘This, of course,
changes annually. Because ath-
letic scholarships only get a
certain amount of this money
(34 per cent), under the current
system now set up, it will be
impossible to increase scholar-
ships.”

Sparrow was, however, unable
or unwilling to give a plan he

-thought would be best for chang-

ing the present system.

Sparrow also said, ‘‘We need
a little more system to our foot-
ball coaching. For instance, we
now have only one full time
coach in football. We at least
need a freshman coach and
maybe another full-time assist-
tant.

“I think."’ he went on, “that
if the field were lighted better,
we would improve gate receipts
and could use that money to
help support an expanded foot-
ball program.”

Sparrow said that his commit-
tee had asked the administration
to study the feasibility of ex-
panding the gymnasium by add-
ing more basketball courts, a
swimming pool,
courts.

Martin said that the adminis-
tration had not yet. started its
study but added. “I would like
to see facilities where every boy
could participate in some sport.
But we just cannot get them
there tomorrow, as some people
seem to think.”

The president estimated that
it would cost as much as $1
million for a gymnasium ex-
pansion such as that of Spar-
row’s suggestion. “‘18'll be a
tough job to raise that much
money for an addition to a
gym already built and named
for someone else,” he warned.

While tying up Trustee meet-
ings with the desire to bring
back the good old days when
little Davidson could play Caro-
lina evenly in football, Sparrow
and his committee might harm
the institution they are respon-
sible for developing. In addi-
tion to the loss of valuable time
when the board members could
be considering things that need
action—such as the library or
changing the masthead of THE
DAVIDSONIAN—there is a per-
fect example from the February
meeting to illustrate this point:

A leading developer of col-
leges in the country, a man con-
nected with several important
foundations, and the educational
consultant for a national publi-
cation, sat in on the meeting to
gather material for a book he is
writing about Trustees at col-
leges all over the country. He
arrived at the meeting about the
time the football supporters dug
in for a good stand on a ‘“‘crash
program.”

A member of the administra-
tion, who wishes not to be iden-
tified. reports that the educa-
tional vonsultant was unhappy
with the Trustees. The gist of his
feeling was that if Davidson
wanted to go on a crash pro-
gram for football, then it was
not the type of school that he
would select as a recipient of
foundation grants.

and handball.

The president managed to
exptain the situation well
enough fo him so that he left
satisfied. Martin’s quiet di-
plomacy, and his value to Da-
vidson, were IUilustrated this
week when the college recelv-
ed a tefier from the visitor
praising Martin's leadership
and calling Davidson one of
the best schools in the na-
tion. Evidentiy Martin, de-
spite the Trustees, sold an
important man on Davidson.

While Sparrow and Hendrix,
who reportedly drivés from
Duke Hospital in Durham to ev-
ery home Davidson football
game and most basketball
games, are proposing to do this
college a tremendous service,
football coach Bill Dole casts a
wary eye at any crash pro-
gram.

Dole stated his position simply
today. “I think if we had just
12 scholarships to give each
year, we could compete in the
Southern Conference. Oyr prob-
Jem has always been allack of
depth -in comparison with other
schools.'’ Dole said that the to-
tal of 49 scholarships for a four
year period would give him a
squad of at least 60 men, count-
ing freshmen, each year.

Dole will have $67,026 next
year for 40 scholarships, or an
average of 10 per year—two less
per year than what Dole thinks
is necessary. Assuming a fro-
zen tuition, over a four-year pe-
riod, two extra scholarships per
year would cost—based on next
year’s $1800 a year—$14,400.

Dole admitted that some ad-
justment would have to be made
in the Living Endowment per-
centage to give him a set num-
ber of scholarships for each
year. He suggested that a set
amount of money be allotted.
instead of a fixed percentage
which has the handicap of mak-
ing the amount of money he
gets fluctuate according to the
gifts the college receives.

But Dole said that the system
whereby football and basket-
ball get a part of the Living En-
dowment is a much better fi-
nancial arrangement than the
old Wildcat Club idea that was
erased by the Trustees in the
mid-1950's.-

Under the old setup, athletic
scholarships came entirely from
donations to the Wildcat Club,
which actually had to compete
against the college itself in rais-
ing money. Because the Living
Endowment has mushroomed,
athletic scholarships are now
receiving much more than what
they had‘ been getting under the
old arrangement.

The members of the Trus-
tees connected to the “crash
football program” might also
consider what basketball coach
Charles “Lefty” Driesell did
In national circles without an
increase in scholarships. He
will only have a total of $19,-
403 for his scholarships for
next year.

The attitude of the Faculty
and of important men connected
in other ways with the college
must also be taken into account
by Sparrow. There has been a
growing sentiment on the fac-
ulty against subsidized athlet-
ies in general. In the Jast regu-
lar Faculty meeting of the year.
the professors voted overwhelm-
ingly to approve Dr. Paul Mar-

give any definite power to the
Faculty in the area of athlet-
ics.

“The Trustees look upon
athletics as their area,” he
explained. “They feel more
competent here than in edu-
cational areas where they are
quite willing for the Faculty
to exercise power.”

Although Marrotte’s motion
has nothing to do with the ques-
tion of subsidized athletics at
this time, it is significant .to
point out that the question has
come up several times in the
past. Dr. W. O. Puckett said
that in his 18 years at Davidson
he had beer associated with
three committees investigating
alternatives to subsidized ath-
letics.

In 1954, a combined Trustee-
Faculty committee studied the
matter of the request of then
President John R. Cunningham.
On April.27 of that year, the
group made a recommendation
to abolish subsidized athletics
and set up what it called an
“Ivy Group" of schools which
would compete on a basis of no
athletic subsidies.

The proposal began: ‘We rec-
ommend to the Trustees that
they authorize the President of
the College to extend an invita-
tion to a selected group of Col-
leges and Universities, asking
them to join with us in setting
up a Conference with a view of
abolishing subsidized athletics
at the earliest possible date.”

The proposal then went on to
set up rules and regulations for
the proposed new conference
and to state the rules which
were to remain in effect long
enough so that players already
in school with scholarships
would nat lose theirs.

19 also affirmed what many
of the Faculty belleve today:
“. . .. In each institution (of
the conference) the academic
authorities should contro! ath-
letics.”

Puckett, who was secretary of
the committee then, signed the
proposal, as did Dean of the
Faculty Frontis W. Johnston
and the following faculty mem-
bers, all of whom are still here:
W. G. McGavock (now on the
Faculty Athletic Committee), J.
T. Kimbrough, and J. W. Reid.
Cunningham also signed, along
with the trustees on the com-
mittee, including the president
of the Trustees then and now.
Dr. J. McDowell Richards.

Richards said yesterday that
he has changed his mind some-
what since the report. ‘Today I
would like to see us go along
with a good program in the
Southern Conference,” he stat:
ed. ‘‘I would like to see us have
a fifty-fifty chance to compete
in football, and I think we have
that under the present pro-
gram."

He then smiled slowly and
said in reference to possible big-
time football at Davidson, “You
may rest assured that the Trus-
tees will consider very slowly
and carefully any change in the
current athletic program.”
