Sexuality Seminar Stresses
Rational Decision Making

By BRUCE MALOY
Staff Writer

Davidson students and
members of the community ,
will have a chance to learn'
about the field of human
sexuality through a sym-
posium which is being held on
campus Oct. 11 and 12.

Karl Goodhouse, who began
studying the field of human
sexuality last year as part of
an Extended Studies project,

said, ‘‘The purpose of the sym-
posium is to get factual in-
formation to students to aid
them in making rational
sexual decisions.”’

Goodhouse pointed out that
the symposium will cover
more than sex and will include:
the areas of physiology,.
sexual expression, human:
sexual relations, and ethical.
and religious considerations.

Speakers have been invited
to discuss each of these four
areas. .

Registration Solves
Late Book Problems

By MARK GERGEN
Staff Writer

Registration began for the
Winter term on Monday, the
19th day of the Fall term. Next
term it will begin on Dec. 9,
the sixth day of Winter term
and the last day of drop/add.

Course registration for this
year’s winter term ends on
Oct. 17, over six weeks before:
the actual beginning of the!
winter term. Spring term!
registration will end on Dec.
18, 12 weeks before the start of
the term.

Registrar Richard C. Burts
Jr. explained that, ‘‘this is the
traditional length of time. The
real reason for this early
registration is the student
store.”

Director of the Student Store
Peter Nichols explained the
need for time. “‘It takes three
weeks for a book to get here,
plus preparation and typing of
the orders. And after the
books get here we, then need
more time to put\them on the
shelves.

“In total, this would require
four weeks, and then to be on |
the safe side, we need another :
two weeks. This is in case the
books. requested aren’t
available,” Nichols explained.

Burts said that his office
could actually process the
registration data within two
days ‘after it has been

According to Nichols, preor-
dering is undesirable for two
reasons. First is the inability
to accurately predict student
demands by past course
preferences. Second is the
overall increased cost.

“If we do prestock, what
courses do we choose to order
at the limit. Prediction won’t
work because of change in
demands. For example last
year the Classics course only
had five students in one term,
the next term it had 20, there
is no way to predict this,”
Nichols explained.

Nichols went on to say that
there is no direct financial
cost of preordering but that it
does raise the overall cost of
the books since companies
must take losses on preor-
dered books that are returned
and can’t be used. :

Burts explained that, ‘‘this
early registration is because
the student store would con-
flict with other schools with
its orders if we waited till af-
ter Christmas.”

“‘We didn’t ask for this early
of a date, but it’s nice to have
it though,”’ Nichols said.

He went on to explain that
the point of conflicting with
other orders could be a
problem, and that,‘‘this early
registration helps the student
since it makes it easier for us
to get the books that are

“TI expect that each person
will talk on his specialty, and
that the others will then
respond in a sort of panel
discussion,’’ said Goodhouse.

Three of the main speakers
at the symposium will be
Harold Minor, a consultant in
family relations and human
sexuality, Mik®é Pasternak, a

‘professor from UNC-C who

will speak on_ values
clarification and Behavioral
Sciences and Training Coord-
inator Tom Clark of Bowman-
Gray School of Medicine.

The symposium will begin
at 3:30 p.m. on Friday and run
until 10 p.m. with a break for
supper. Rusk House has been
reserved for those wishing to
meet and talk with the
speakers and others that par-
ticipate in the symposium.

The symposium will con-
tinue at 10 a.m. on Saturday
and run until 4 p.m. with a
break for lunch, perhaps in the
form of a picnic. °

“A large part of the sym-
posium will be -allotted for
small group discussions led by
doctors, faculty members and
people from Planned Paren-
thood,’’ explained Goodhouse.

The symposium is the first
part of a program’to provide
information. on human
sexuality.’ Dean of Students
Will H. Terry said plans are
being discussed to organize
sexual counseling on campus
to find who is available and
what special skills or
knowledge they can con-
tribute. ©

Terry cited a mandate from
the trustees approved six
years ago stating that the
college should ‘‘counsel in
drug, alcohol and_ sex
problems,”

The culmination of the in-
creased awareness which the
symposium organizers hope to
foster may be a course in
human sexuality as part of the
regular curriculum.
Goodhouse and Phil Safriet
wrote a syllabus for such a

_ dividual academic needs.”” ;.....
