The C In YMCA

This year the C in YMCA has stood
for both concern and controversy.

Under Joe Howell’s leadership the
Y has emphasized Christian concern
for others and has brought contro-
versial speakers to the campus. In the
process it has secured for itself a
campus role. Until this year many of
us doubted whether the YMCA had a
place on this campus.

Howell admits that he shared those
doubts when he took office last spring.
But rather than become involved in
an unproductive debate on whether
the Y deserves to exist at this church-
related college. he built a strong
cabinet and gave its members plenty
of leeway in planning their parts of
the Y program.

In two areas, community service
and forums, the YMCA has this year
far outstripped past efforts.

Under the new tutorial program
for Negro high school students led by
Rat Curry and Duncan Newcomer,
Davidson students have taken advan-
tage of a significant opportunity to
express their Christian concern in the
community.

And if Mecklenburg County school
superintendent Dr. Craig Phillips ever
gets around to granting permission to
use the gym in the local Negro ele-
mentary school at night, Steve Rams-

Dingdong Daddy

For years and years the Student
Council has said campaigning won't .
work at Davidson, and for years and
years this newspaper has wondered
editorially, Why Not.

This vear. we are most pleased to
report, Dingdong Daddy and the Dit-
tomice took a deep breath and de-
parted from entrenched tradition to
institute limited campaigning via
mimeographed platforms and a new
system of filing for office. They also
set up a concentrated elections sched-
ule, and among the tangible results
were:

@ more original piatforms and new
issues than have been presented in
approximately the last 10 years

@ a phenomenal increase of some
20 percent in voting turnout over the
last several years

@ a large student turnout for the
forum in the Union featuring the four
candidates for Student Body President
vs. various “nasty people” like John
Spratt. Questions were consistently
more specific than answers, but those
in attendance were afforded an ex-
cellent chance to hear the candidates
expound on various subjects.

Traditionally, this newspaper does
not discuss candidates editorially. We
do, however, have a few words to say
about some issues.

A number of concrete, plausible,
and above ail original ideas have been
presented in the platforms of differ-
ent candidates, and if the new Student
Body officers manage to effect half
of their campaign promises, 1964-65
should be a most memorable year at
Davidson.

burgh has lined up enough volunteers
to supervise new boys’ and men’s
basketball leagues.

What made this year an unqualified
success for the YMCA. however, was
Howell’s choice of Bill Ferris and Jay
Federman to put teeth in the faculty
rule that all controversial speakers
must be answered by speakers with
opposite views.

To answer the Vespers and Chapel
speakers, Forums chairmen Ferris
and Federman brought atheists Scriv-
en and Barchilon. Without doubt the
“Challenges to the Christian Faith”
forums have stimulated more honest
discussions on the relevance of Chris-
tianity than have been heard here in
recent years.

Judging by the student attendance
at the forums, the Y has finally dis-
covered a realistic way to assist the
student concerned about his personal
beliefs.

This year under Joe Howell, the Y
has provided more opportunities than
ever for students to express Christian
concern and confront controversy,
The success of the program can be
measured by the increase in student
participation. Next year's YMCA
president has a large pair of shoes to
ill.

. CHR

However, in the search for issues,
several candidates came up with some
rather ill-advised proposals. For in-
stance, one candidate suggested tak-
ing a “poll of student opinion before
major ‘legislation is passed by the
Council.” Such is ridiculous, and in-
déed denies the very purpose of hav-
ing a Student Council.

“Elected representative” means
just that, and although council mem-
bers are responsible for being aware
of student opinion, they are also re-
sponsible for voting according to their
own convictions as to what is in the
best interest of the student body,
whether or not their convictions hap-
pen to coincide with majority opin-
ion.

Another candidate’s platform call-
ing for “some (council) control over
the IFC, the YMCA, and the Union
Committee” bothers us. Frankly, what
those organizations choose to do is
none of the Student Council’s busi-
ness. Coordination perhaps, but not
control.

Other misguided proposals . were
more humorous than obnoxious. For
example, one freshman advocated the
publishing and distribution of student
ratings of professors to allow for more
“objective selection” of courses,

Overall, however, the platforms
have given students a rare, if limited,
opportunity to vote on issues. We look
forward to much constructive action
by the incoming council, and we will
be interested in seeing who lives up
to what.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

ie

Professors Past And Present
Defend Hill From Ferris Charge

Tucker

Dear Editor:

Mr. Bill Ferris has written to
your paper two letters (March
6 and 13) which motivate me to
make a clarification. In the
second of his letters I am listed
as being one of seven staff
members who have left or are
leaving Davidson ‘‘because of
conflict with the administra-
tion."" Although I am not quali-
fied to explain. the circum.
stances pertaining to the depar-
ture of the other six men listed,
I suspect that each case is some
what unique and consequently
not subject to simple classifica-
tion.

My resignation was motivated
by a dissatisfaction with my
position here. The decline of
Spanish studies and our failure

to establish a program of foreign’

study in a Spanish speaking
eountry have been two princ’val
sources of this dissatisfaction.
Before submitting my resigna
tion I discussed the situation
with President Martin and D-an
Johnston, both of whom gave me

Chatterjee

sympathetic hearings and. made
reasonable efforts to deal with
the problems. Even though their
efforts in treating the major
matters were. not successful, I
appreciate and respect their con-
cern. I do not feel, and I trust
that they do not feel, that any
conflict exists between them and
me,

I am confident that Mr. Fer-
ris’ criticism was intended to be
constructive. but it should be
pointed out to him that his two
letters are highly susceptible to
erroneous interpretation and
could possibly reflect discredit
on the men listed therein. It is
unfortunate that a faculty mem-
ber may not change jobs without
having to reveal his motives to
the readers of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN.

On S$ ’nP

BY ROMIR CHATTERJEE

The rumblings within the depths of the Union, we’d
been told, came from Ackerman and his crew, laboring in
the Seripts ‘n Pranks office. And lo and behold, last week
brought with it the literary event of the semester which
we had all been waiting for. Wednesday the 11th saw
each Gentleman on campus leafing through his very
own “literary and humor magazine” .. . . the publication
one hears so much about, vet, so seldom sees. If the ex-

<

pression on the Gentleman’s face was one of bewilder-
ment and if he wore a furrowed brow, it was perhaps,
due to a brand of satire peculiar to the Scripts ‘n Pranks
_... at times too obvious, at times too involved.

If at any point satire is truly
successful in the ‘x Libris"
issue, it is in Ackerman’s elab-
orations on the implications of
the “Fight Song.*’ Frequently.
while reading it. the impulse
was to chuckle, which is what
one looks for in a magazine of
this sort. The ‘digs’ are not
overtly obvious, the humour Jess
devious than, say, Ackerman‘s
Balm delivered through the in-
scrutable Ches R. Cat (or just
plain ol’ Ches R., to those who
know him well, ha, ha). At the
end of this latter piece, having
been put through rigorous men-
tal exercises, one can barely
manage a throaty, _ spluttery,
and definitely cancerous cough!

Satire is a subtle art. Surely,
if Bilt Ferris had a point in his
Cankeronian adventure, it was
too naively stated. Towards the
end one looks with some a-

mount of sympathy at the highly’

practical manner in which the
Canker administration deals

with the precocious Drugger .. .
so what if the wrath of the God
falls upon the college in so
dramatic a fashion?

A pleasing innovation was the
inclusion of a photographic fea-
ture on none other thun a set
of Queens’ bombshells, with ac-
companying information which
will, I feel sure. prove useful to
many. Naturally enough. the
tendency was to pay greater
attention to Martin Lafferty's
artful presentation than to the
text (hem, hem). There were
other compensating factors in
this issue; notably, the efforts
of the cartoonists, of short-story
writer Pruitt and poet Vick.

One wished, at the end of it.
that editor Ha-Ha-Hank Acker.
man had found less cause to
rely on cleverness (example:
“Ex Libris literally means, out
of the library’) in order that
the reader might wind up in
convulsions of unstemmable
laughter.

ping from the DAVIDSONIAN
of the letter which ole Bill Fer-
ris wrote concerning the annual
exodus of some of Davidson’s
younger professors. Bill asserts
that some are forced out be-
cause the college refuses .to re-
new their contracts and that
many are allowed to leave be-
cause they have criticized the
Davidson system. I cannot pre-
sume to speak for anyone else,
but, since he has included my
name among the deportees, I
would like to clarify my person-
al situation.

(1) I have carried on an un-
abashed love affair with David-
son College since I arrived on
her campus as a freshman in
1947 and my passion continues
unabated.

(2) On occasion I have dis-
agreed with everyone from Doc
White to President Martin, but
I have never found the college
unwilling to tolerate criticism.

(3) I have not been ‘banished
forever. I am on a_ two-year
leave of absence to the Univer-
sity of Virginia where I am
working toward a doctorate in
mathematics. This year's study
was made possible through two
fellowships. The college nomin-
ated me for the first and pro-
vided half the stipend for the
second. Perhaps this was simply
a clever way to get rid of me,
but I consider it rather helpful.

(4) I am eagerly anticipating
the day when I can leave this
land of the Wahoos and return
to the home of the tenth-ranked
Wildcats. Perhaps then I will
deserve to be included in Bill's
list of Davidson's finest.

Ferris

Dear Editor:

This year Davidson is having
a number of highly controversial
speakers visit the campus. Their
presence has given students an
opportunity to reexamine their
values through creative conflict
with men whose views differ
from their own. The atmosphere
which these men have created
here has shown how valuable
academic freedom is to a col-
lege.

I think the student body should
recognize that this academic
freedom is largely due to the
courage of our president. He has
been attacked by numerous
groups and individuals for al-
lowing views other than their
own on campus. He has made it
clear to these groups that Dav-
idson's purpose is to serve as a
center of education, not of in-
doctrination.

We students owe a vote of
thanks to our president for the
courage and foresight he has
exercised in defending our right
to academic freedom.

ASTERISK

On Faith, Buttrick Assumes
The Dialogues Of History

BY RICK VON UNWERTH

Sometimes we wonder if it’s the singer, not the song. ,

Dr. Michael Scriven offered himself to us as the
Blonde Brute, with a magnetism which compelled the
unwilling to admire his intellectual grip on existence,
and to give at least an inch or two in his direction.

Dr. George Buttrick was this week's giant, and the
chords of his tremendous rhetoric filled our minds and
left them reverberating his simple tune of faith.

“Open-mindedness .. . what is that?” he said.
“A mind open at both ends is a wind tunnel. The
mind should be open like the mouth is open—you
sit down at the table to put something in the mouth
and close on it.” Dr. Buttrick’s mind has closed
around the very nutritious assumption that God
exists in a continuing dialogue with the world.

That assumption is the basis for a perfectly consist-
ent view of the universe. ‘The universe—that’s an as-
sumption. Uni-verse . . . one verse—one song—one sys-
tem. Science has to make the assumption that there is a
universe.”

Dr. Buttrick’s assumption rests on faith; in fact it
is faith. A biblical faith in a dialogue between God and
man, and the key to its translation is the single Event
in which God became man. The dialogue is the pattern
of an otherwise patternless history, he says, and he told
Arnold Toynbee so in a debate he mentioned. “Sure there
are repetitions in history. Any dialogue has repetitions . . .
that doesn’t mean there’s a pattern of cycles. Would you
like to think of a pattern for Arnold Toynbees?” Of
course they both laughed. “It was a lot of fun,” he said,
“and Toynbee’s a wonderful man.”

He talked on about faith. It’s not just religion that
“leans on faith.” Everything finds its way back to as-
sumptions of faith. We don’t push knowledge to its limits
and then “reach for the ship of faith.” He explained:
“Knowledge is simply a boat on the sea of faith. We don’t
arrive at it, we start there.”

In chapel Tuesday, Dr. Buttrick conjured up
several telling images of man in the society of
science. “We are repeated sounds,” he proposed,
“in a cacophony of hard footsteps.” Men are pieces
of machinery on a production line, he said, and the
children of the jet-paced Organization Man are
“blown through the world like leaves.” He was a
sensitive analyst of man in a man-made world, and
in his lectures his words were those of a poet and
not a pastor.

Wednesday night he preached. His sermon was
neither a misty evangelism nor a series of pedantic
rationalizations; it was a message to individuals in an
Age of Anxiety. He defined the elusive word “faith.”
It is “being grasped by the mystery and then accepting
the grasp.” The mystery was the enigma of man’s de-
pendence, of man’s purpose, of man’s uniqueness.

‘He spoke of man as a paradox: of dust and divinity,
of the sinner who was once divine. He spoke of man as
the wellspring of anxiety. And he spoke of hope. “The
Bible sees abundant hope,” he said. “But it never gets
starry-eyed about human nature.” When you clear away
the crust of accretions and mythology, the concrete mes-
sage of the Bible remains as “unassailable truth”: God,
and man, and hope.

Perhaps we get lost in a fog of grandiloquence dis-
guised as simplicity. Whatever the reason, Dr. Buttrick’s
chords sounded a stirring strain of truth.

Crocker On Jazzmen

BY DAN CROCKER

The sounds of contemporary jazz filled Hodson Hall
last Friday night, the eve of the civil rights march staged
in Charlotte last weekend. Producing this entertaining
music were Sid Farrar at piano, Stanley Kerr at bass,
and Dave Hoag at drums.

The jazz trio's concert was dedicated to the civil
rights movement, especially to last Saturday’s march in
Charlotte. The stirring “Freedom Cry,” a Farrar original,
was specifically designated the theme of the demonstra-
tions.

Other impressive originals by
Farrar included ‘‘Moslem,”
“Boogie in Five,"’ and “Cliche.”
numbers which were certainly
as entertaining as those on the
program composed ‘by famous
jazz men such as Thelonious
Monk, Duke Ellington, and
Henry Mancini. Perhaps the
highlights of the program were
the rare versions of ‘St. Louis
Blues" and a number entitled

Approximately 115 students, in-
cluding students from Johnson
C. Smith and Livingston, were
present. The crowd's reaction
was quite favorable to the eve-
ning’s entertainment. Though
contemporary jazz groups such
as Farrar’s trio are faced with
stiff competition from various
other styles of music popular
today, audience enthusiasm and
appreciation for contemporary

drummer Hoag displayed his
talents with a rousing solo.

For a Davidson musical per-
formance, the number of people
attending was surprisingly good.

jazz showed that it has not been
overshadowed at Davidson.
Thanks to Farrar's trio, con-
temporary jazz can be appre-
ciated and enjoyed firsthand
right on the Davidson campus.
