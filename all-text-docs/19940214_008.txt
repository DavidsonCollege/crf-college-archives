8 THE DAVIDSONIAN
I awoke to the sun pouring in on F :
my face and the yell of the guys. Rosie Molinary

“Did you call the can man?” I
lay in bed wondering where I was,
and then remembered. The house
was over a hundred years old; the
hardwood floors held memories of
many children, many families,
many tragedies, and many tri-
umphs.

Now its use is different. The
house that stands on a tree-lined
road in a small, antique town is
home for fraternity boys who long
to relive the days of the Old South.

I watched the boys talk among
themselves. Stories of the previ-
ous night’s happenings filled the
air. There didn’t seem to be a
worry in the world greater than
what time the fish would start bit-
ing.

Isaw Mr. Can Man then. As!
walked out into the backyard, I
heard a rustling, a tinkering, and
then a gruff voice. There stood a
dark man clothed in navy blue. I
looked for a moment, and I didn’t
understand. Then, slowly, the lazy
feeling wandered away and was
replaced by more alert sensations.

I watched as he talked among
the boys. Mr. Can Man didn’t

In my eyes.

seem like he was okay. It was hard
for me to understand his deep voice
and I thought he might be drunk.

We left for lunch. As we drove
past the scenic homes that told the
tales of the Old South, I sat silent,
disturbed. Icouldn’t pinpoint what
was bothering me, though.

He was sitting on the back
porch when we pulledup. Leaning
against a support pole, his eyes
lingered for a moment, closed, and
then popped open as he heard our
car doors. He rose from the porch
in a hurry and rushed back over to
the trash bins surrounded by beer
cans.

“I’m getting along,” he said
aloud.

We all greeted him and intro-
duced ourselves. He paused, tak-
ing us all in with his dark, endless
eyes. As he did this, I observed
him. His face seemed to say he had
seen better days, but he didn’t un-
derstand they were days that had
passed. He had seen a lot in his life

and maybe all of it was just a blur
now. I didn’t know, and I couldn’t
understand, even though I really
wanted to.

“They call me Can Man. My
real name is Manuel.” He didn’t
seem to mind the nickname, but I
immediately made a mental note
to call him by his name. I wanted
him to know that I saw him as a
person and not just someone who
came to take the cans to be re-
cycled after a big party.

He looked at me for a mo-
ment, and I wondered what he was
thinking, or whether he was just
remembering golden days.

“You look foreign,” he told
me.

“Yes sir, I’m Puerto Rican.”

“You don’t talk like a Puerto
Rican—your English is good. You
talk like white folk.” He was look-
ing at me, as I had at him.

“Yes sir. I’ve been in the States
since I wastwo. Military. Butboth
my parents are Puerto Rican.”

Whites not always "out to get" African-Americans

mission, they are less likely to go
out of their way to help their cus-
tomers.) Let me explain myself.

I think everyone has experi-
enced bad service, or at some time
has not been treated with respect. I
could not even begin to count the
number of times that I have had a
bad waitress, or sales clerk who
either ignored me or treated me
improperly. I cannot necessarily
defend the sales clerks at Dover’s
because I was not present during
this incident, but couldn’t we just
as easily chalk it up to incompe-
tent, bad service?

I am positive that most.Afri-
can-Americans are justified in
claiming that they have at some
time in their life been treated un-
justly because of their skin color.
As a white American I find it very
difficult to resolve our past history
of slavery. It embarrasses me the
way white Americans abused an-

other race because they incorrectly
believed they were “inferigr.” I
am sure that African-Americans
must also have difficulty resolving
their resentment for this treatment.
Thus, African-Americans can
often be justified when they be-
lieve that people mistreat them
because they are of a different race,
but I think that sometimes we are
all too hypersensitive to these is-
sues. Ms. Miller cannot be certain
that those employees were racist
any more than she can claim that
they were wearing red underwear.
Quoting Miller: “Until you
know for certain that my personal
character is less than acceptable to
society, never discriminate or show
racial bias toward me.” Just as she
accuses people of judging
someone’s character before they
truly know a person, she too seems
to be assuming too much without
knowing all the facts.
Many of the racial tensions
stem from misunderstandings and

ignorance. Instead of always look-
ing for some way to be offended
and insulted, we should try to give
the benefit of the doubt (whenever
possible) and work together.

It saddens me to think that
many African-Americans assume
that the majority of whites are “out
to get them.” In many cases this is
not true. Instead of getting angry,
one may achieve more by explain-
ing oneself articulately than when
one yells and argues.

I reflect on my own experi-
ences at home. If I really wanted to
get something from my parents, I
might make myself heard if I
screamed and yelled, but I was not
making myself understood. The
only time I ever achieved any
ground was when I sat down and
explained myself in a soft manner.

Ifthe Dover’s employees were
racist, Millertelling them that they
were “ignorant” and “narrow-
minded” probably instilled more
hate than previously existed.

“So you don’t speak Span-
ish?” He seemed disappointed.

“I do speak Spanish. I just
never picked up an accent.”

“I was wondering. I was with
a Puerto Rican woman. Down in
Florida. Yes ma’am, I was with a
Puerto Rican woman. She could
cook. She could sing. She could
dance. And when I got her mad—
oh boy, I better watch my back
because my woman taught me
some lessons. You sure do remind
me of her. You have her eyes.
Those black eyes, you know that
Puerto Rican women seem myste-
rious because of those eyes.
They’re pretty powerful. And that
temper. Have you got that tem-
per?” I shook my head no.

“Yes ma’am, that’s the love
of my life. And you brought her
back to me today. It’s a long way
to Florida, you know. A lot more
than these cans can pay for.”

He grinned now in the
memory, lingering in the past. I
realized these were the days I had
seen in his eyes that he didn’t real-
ize were over. My heart shed a
silent tear as I remembered all the
days I had cursed how dark my
eyes were, how horribly plain I
was, or how little I had to offer
others.

There were days when being
Puerto Rican didn’t even occur to
me. And there I was, on the back
porch of a house in a strange town,
with a man whom I had pleased
unintentionally because of my na-
tionality and’ my patience to hear
his story. It dawned on me that we
often overlook and fail to appreci-
ate the things that make us unique.

Suddenly, the little girl that
had begged for green contacts
seemed to notice her black eyes for
the first time. She smiled.

has had chocolate bars.

I can help out in other areas
that require special ministerial as-
sistance as well. Have you ever
been frustrated by one of those
Catholic (or any other right wing
religion) girls (or boys—I guess it
happens) who chant that Georgia
Satellites song to you: “No hug-ee
no kiss-ee ‘til I get a weddin’ ring.

. Don’t hand me no lines and
keep your hands to yourself.”

Well, look no further. All you
have to do is get your honey of
choice good and liquored up, find
the good Rev. Nathan (around three
o’clock in the morning I’m usually
in the Outpost telling girls what
extraordinary legs they have)
and—presto—you have a blush-
ing spouse. Noring? No problem.
All you have to do is find an old
beer cans with the pull off tabs.

. One of my uncles actually
used a pop top from a can of Pabst
Blue Ribbon when he asked his
wife to marry him. Suffice it to say
that family reunions are a hoot.

Now that I’m a great religious

leader and all (and a pacifist to
boot), I guess Davidson has two
people on campus who are exactly
like Martin Luther King and Ma-
hatma Gandhi. Amen, brother.

Irs Valentine's Day, and you’re
probably thinking that I’m going
to write about love, the true mean-
ing of romance or some other nebu-
lousconcept which reflects today’s
holiday.

Well, surprisingly, I don’t
have a date on this special holiday,
and I’m just not in the mood to
write about love, so bah humbug.
(Actually, I should be used to not
having a date since I’m only bat-
ting 1 for 22 on Valentine’s Days
in my life which might even be
worse than Nathan Seay’s aver-
age. And, yes, Nathan, even dress-
ing up like a woman didn’t get me

a date.)

Recently, [went toseea movie
that not only disturbed me, but left
a deep scar on my soul, probably
for the rest of my life. Inthe movie
Philadelphia, the rapid deteriora-
tion of the main character and the
prejudices against homosexuals
and people infected with the AIDS
virus should be enough to disturb _
even the most insensitive of view-
ers. :

The one scene that stands out
in my mind the most, however, isa
scene in which a man comes to the
front of an angry mob and yells to
Hanks’ character, “God created
Adam and Eve, not Adam and
Steve.” For the rest of the movie,
I was troubled by this unloving
comment proclaimed in the name
of God (kind of like the really cool
medieval Crusades concept of kill-
ing for Christ). My response to
such a comment would be that
“God created Adam, Steve, Eve,
Jane, you, me, and everyone else.

In giving such a response, I’m
not saying that homosexuality is
“right,” nor am I saying that it is
“wrong.” I think such a question is
notas important as everyoneseems
to think. What is important is how
we react to anyone who is different
than we are.

As a Christian, the first ex-
ample which I look towards for a
model of behavior is Jesus. The
Jesus I look towards is not the
popular icon carelessly used as a
cultural justification for book
burnings, abortion clinicbombings,
condemnation of homosexuality
and all of the other negative im-
ages which seem to plague Chris-
tianity these days.

The Jesus.I look towards is a
radical with an unbending com-
mitment to loving all people by
crossing over any boundary, no
matter how scandalous such an
action would be. The Jesus I look
towards is the one I find in the
gospels written by Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John.
