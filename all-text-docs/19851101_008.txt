Kansas City saves Series, fan’s spirit

By ANDY BARRON

For a sports fan, no thrill exceeds that
of having your favorite team win a cham-
pionship.

I can finally make that statement from
an experienced standpoint, thanks to last
week's World Series. When the Kansas
City Royals came back from a three game
to one deficit to beat the St. Louis Cardi-
nals in seven games. this lifelong fan got
his day in the sun. The long off-season
will be a lot sweeter with the Royals as
champs.

The Royals will not go down as one
of the great teams in baseball history. In
fact, anyone who thinks Kansas City
tanks among the poorer teams to ever be
crowned as baseball's king has a strong
case. Yet no team has ever shown more
perseverance than the Royals did in
1985.

Though defending champions of the
AL West, Kansas City spent most of the
year chasing the surprising California
Angels. Shortly after the All-Star break,
Kansas City trailed the Angels by nine
games, wasn’t getting any hitting and
seemed to be washed up for the year.

If there was any one game that turned
the season around for the Royals, I'd say
it was a Monday night game against the
Yankees.in late July. In front of a national
television audience, Kansas City came
back from a 3-0 deficit with a five- run

sixth inning. A clutch two-run single by
DH Hal McRae highlighted the inning
and pulled McRae out of a season long
slump.

Kansas City won that game 5-3 and
immediately went on a tear that pulled
them even with California a couple of
weeks later and kept the division race
tight for the rest of the year. A rejuve-
nated McRae put some extra meat in the
previously vegetarian batting lineup of
Kansas City. The added punch forced op-
posing: teams to pitch to superstar third
baseman George Brett. Brett responded
by hitting almost .400 for the month of
August and staking his claim for Ameri-
can League MVP honors by hitting .330
with 30 homers and 112 RBI's.

The Royals’ weak hitting (only
Califomia had a lower team batting aver-
age) put extra pressure on the team’s
young pitching staff. Never known as a
great pitching team, Kansas City got fan-
tastic years from Bret Saberhagen, Char-
lie Leibrandt, Mark Gubicza and Danny
Jackson. Reliever extraordinaire Dan
Quisenberry once again led the major
league in saves.

Saberhagen deserves special men-
tion. The 21-year-old righthander had a
record of 20-6 with an ERA of just over
two and a half. Though Ron Guidry of the
Yankees won more games, Saberhagen's
considerably lower ERA (almost a full

‘ run a game lower), coupled with the extra

help Guidry received from his team’s
superior offense, make Saberhagen the
better pitcher and more deserving candi-
date for the American League Cy Young
Award.

Kansas City’s chief strength toward
winning the crown of the baseball world
rested in their unaccountable ability to
climb out of impossibly deep holes. To
finally beat the pesky Angels, the Royals
had to win three out of four games be-
tween the two teams in the season's final
week. To beat the Toronto Blue Jays in
the American League Championship
Series, Kansas City had to win three
straight games, two on the road.

Finally, Kansas City had to rally from
a 2-0 deficit after losing the two opening
games at home. In winning the World
Series, the Royals became the first team
in World Series history to come back
from such a poor start.

The Series was a wild one. Kansas
City accomplished the dubious distine-
tion of becoming the first team since
1939 to lose a World Series game after
going into the ninth inning with a two or
more run lead. Charlie Leibrandt lost that
heartbreaker for the Royals after pitching
a shutout for eight innings.

Leibrandt’s streak of hard luck hit
again in the sixth game when he gave upa
run in the seventh inning to give St. Louis

a 1-0 lead and put St. Louis only two in-
nings away from a World Series title.

But fate took pity on poor Mr. Leib-
randt and clouded the first base umpire’s
mind into calling Kansas City hitter Jorge
Orta safe to lead off the Royal’s desperate
ninth inning effort. As réplays attested,
Orta was actually out by a full step. Yet
the dirty deed was done and Kansas City _
answered this knock from opportunity
and won the game 2-1.

The seventh and final game turned
out to be a blowout instead of the World
Series classic it could have been. Cardi-
nal ace John Tudor ran out of gas and the
Royals won a laugher 11-0. Classic or
not, a championship is a championship
and Kansas City fans were happy to see
their team beat up their cross-state rivals
and take finger sizes for World Series
rings.

By winning the World Series, Kansas
City proved that Yogi Berra was right
when he said, “It ain’t over ‘til it’s over”
and ruined the festivities of the seemingly
infinite number of people who had
jumped on the Cardinal bandwagon pre-
maturely. Guess they'll all have to trade
in those brand new Cardinals hats for
Royals hats before they are broken in.
Yes sir, everything was up-to-date in
Kansas City after baseball crowned the
Royals king on Sunday night.

Inspired club gndders
defeat Blue Devils

By IAN DUNN

Question: Have the Davidson
Wildcats won a football game this
year?

Answer: Yes, they beat the
Duke Blue Devils 14-12. How-
ever, this victory was not at the
hands of the Gatto-led gridiron
gladiators, but the Club Football
team led by junoir Mark Sandy.

Rebounding from a disap-
pointing loss to App State (played
on astroturf and under the light),
Davidson rose to the occasion
against Duke on Oct. 12. The Cats
took an early lead with sophomore
Sonny Larabee’s 78-yard
touchdown run, The Cats built on
the lead with freshman Sherb Sen-
tell’s ten-yard touchdown run and
had a 14-0 lead at the half. The
Wildcats went on to down the
Blue Devils 14-12 with the de-

fense thwarting a final Duke
drive.

The team, comprised of about
25 players, practices once a week
and faces the likes of Clemson,
N.C. State, UNC, App State and
Duke. Through always outnum-
bered (the opposition often fields
50 or more players), the Cats rely
on a strong defense anchored by
senior Brian Rice and junior Blair
Schrum. As one player remarked
‘we have a lot of individual talent,
but we need more practice to learn
to play as a team.”

The club football team con-
cludes their season on Parents’
Weekend against Clemson. The
