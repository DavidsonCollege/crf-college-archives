We Are Still.
Lacking

Recently, Davidson’s Musie Department
has gained great heights in national and, re-
gional recognition, Though this Liberal Arts
College has no Fine Arts Department, the
Music Department, under the direction of
Mr. Pfghi, nas added much to cultural aspect
of this college life. As a result of this depart-
ment’s work, we now have an excellent Artist
Coneert Series with promise of even better
in the future. We have, also, one of the really
outstanding college bands in the South, and
the college has gained much favorable pub-
licity through their coneert tours. The David-
son College Male Chorus is probably unex-
celled in the South, and their concerts have
added a great deal to the college’s reputa-
tion. All these factors have entered in, and
helped the average Davidson student to a more
thorough appreciation of music. Let this,
therefore, be a tribute to the Davidson Music
Department, a vote of thanks for their
achievements and an encouragement to
“keep up the good work.’’

In spite of these factors, however, there
is still much lacking in the Arts program of
Davidson (assuming there is some plan).
Those students who have had no previous
musical training have little opportunity to
learn to actually appreciate these musical
programs presented, Though it may be ask-
ing tootmeh to suggest the immediate estab-
lishment of a Fine Arts Department, may we
at least have a thorough course in the appre-
ciation of the Fine Arts? How can this be a
Liberal Arts College with little liberalism
and practically no arts?=B. C.

Letters to the
Editor...

The Editor of the Davidsonian,
Dear Sir;

I would like to speak out on a matter that
has been a source of irritation to me since
this school session began, and, I think, not
to me only. That to which I refer is the Con-
federate flag-waving that has gone on at the
pep rallies'and football games and the adop-
tion of ‘‘Dixie’’ as our new ‘fight song. I
have been expecting at any time to see the
team come out in new uniforms of homespun
grey. Now.I am a Southerner and proud of
it, as are most members of the student body,
and J] don’t object. to the above-mentioned
practices as such. They are fine in their
place, but I do object to the attitude that
has come to be associated with them. Per-
haps these things have been done naively as
a booster to campus morale, and I may be at-
taching too much significdnée to the matter,
but I think it is unwholesome for the follow-
ing reasons: :

1, The attitude is one of discourtesy not
in keeping with traditional Davidson: spirit.
Davidson in the past has always tried to
make members of the visiting team feel wel-
come—the Beaver Club, one of our most

active organizations, was designed largely '

for this purpose. A visiting player should be
judged by his conduct on the field’and not
ridiculed because his name does not have an
Anglo-Saxon ring, or because he does not

hail from below the Mason and Dixon line.
A Ragunas or a Tamalis should be as wel

2. The attitude one the
variety, Davidson does not make a
poliey of drawing players from the northern

doing so, but why should we begrudge othe!
schools playing northern boys if they do
have them in their student it a
free country, and all the plavers have Deen
ruled eligible by Southern Conference of-
ficials. It seems petty and of little consola-
tion to me to explain away our conference
losses by saying that we are at least all fine
young southern gentlemen.

5. It is an attitude of littleness that
Davidson would be well rid of. The day of
sectionalism im the United States isy,or at
least should be, over. We cannot forpet our
southern heritage, of course, but the South
cannot rise from its present comparatviely

4—The-attitude.is.one of deterrent to the’ |

progress of the college. Davidson will prob-
ably always be content to train southerners
only; for this it was designed and thus per-
haps it will best fulfill its function. 1 would
like to advance my belief, however, that an
infusion of more students from other parts
of the country would be an_ intellectual
stimulus to the school, We are almost too
much °a homogenous group. Having’ had
much the same family background and ex-
perience, we terid to take the same attitude
toward current questions, attitudes which are
often prejudicéd, There is often little dif-
ference of opinion among us, Which is not
especially conducive to original thought and
adequaté expression thereof. Well-prepared
students from northern and western high
schools would serve to raise schoiastic levels
and keep both faculty and fellow-students
on their toes, intellectually.

I have not mentioned the facet that such
an attitude as has been displayed might well
serve as a source of embarassment to those
northerners and westerners now among the
student body, all of whom are as ardent
Davidsonians as the Georgians or Caro-
linians; the fact seems obvious.

This statement is made with all good will
and in the interest of the student body, ask-
ing@only that the matter be considered.

Sincerely,
BILL JOYNER,

To the Editor:

This letter reflects, 1 believe, a growing
feeling among the students of Davidson Col-
lege. It is written in no spirit of complaint,
but because I am sure the faculty is in-
terested in student opinions and_ student
needs. We who are enrolled at Davidson
know we are receiving excellent training;
that-is the reason we are here. Some. of us
think, however, that that training often lacks
the progressive aids which have been used
elsewhere with great success. It is very easy
for education to become stereotyped and in-
flexible. It can hardly be denied that David-
son offers very little in the way of visual
education. The college has no dramatic de-
partment, and although the vailant efforts
of the Red and Black Masquers are a great
help in filling this gap, still we have little
opportunity te-sStudy great plays as they
should be studied—from the other side of the
footlights, rather than out of a textbook.

The college needs Departments of Drama,
of Journalism, and of Fine Arts. If these can-
not be supplied, other things could be found’
which would in some measure compensate
for their absence, For exaniple, there could
be no better way of beginning an acquaint-
ance with Shakespeare, and certainly no
pleasanter one, than by seeing Laurence
Olivier’s: superb production of Henry V, re-
cently. playing in Charlotte; but there was
no organized by the English Department
eithey to bring it to Davidson, or to make it
possible for us to see it'in Charlotte as part
of our work in English. Certainly it is worth
as much as several lectures in making Eliza-
bethan London real to students of today.
Second in effectiveness only to seeing these
productions would be to hear thém in such
recordings as the three Columbia albunis of

‘Paul Robeson’s magnificent performance in

Othello,

Foreign movies presented, and if neces-
sary, charged for, by the various language
societies would increase the value of the
training we receive in language courses, More
extensive use of recofdings might also be
useful, as would anything else that would
encourage us to hear and speak the language
rather than merely to read-it.

Outside contacts with other kinds of peo-
ple and ideas, no matter how arranged,
would broaden our outlook and reduce the
ingrowing tendencies which cannot help but
exist under present conditions, For instance,
more of the chapel services might be utilized
to bring speakers who would present new
points of view and give first-hand informa-
tion on matters of current importance. (A
few such speakers have been brought to us,
and we-congratulate those responsible.)

There are surely many things, perhaps
better known to the faculty than to us,
which would stimulate us in our work and
make the educational program of Davidson
Jollege more vital and more alive. There may

DR GOLDIERE
Dr. Goldiere came to Davidson
twenty-five years ago, a “yankee”
planning to stay only a year. He
hoped that the Southerners could
stand him that long, and he, them.
His stay of f
long a period is © ™
evidence of how —
well he could be

so

stood and how
well he can
stand, but more
than that it is
evidence of his
great affection
for Davidson.
His position at

Davidson is the only one ke has
held since graduation from col-
lege, with the exception of short
professorships at Mary Baldwin and
Queens colleges during the recent
war.

After graduation from  Dart-
mouth, Dr. Goldiere studied at
Yale University from which he

earned his masters degree and his
iby, IBY, hia Languages.
He studied in France at the Uni-
versity after the first
World War while in the Army of
Occupation. He has also done work
at the French Institute of the Uni-

Romance

of Caen

versity of Pennslyvania and in
Madrid.
Outside of the classroom, Dr.

Goldiere is interested in gardening,
particularly in cultivating flowers.

A comparison of male and female
students, made by Dr. Goldiere is
quite interesting. He says that the
superior men students are better
than the superior girl students, but
that there are more poor men stu-
dents, in the realm of his observa-
tion.

THANKSGIVING
Thanksgiving is the one holiday
which is uniquely Christian

Christian because it is
set apart to thank God. American
because it has its origin in the

Plymouth colony and is celebrated

American.

Jexclusively in this country. It is

the most shocking inconsistency
for-an_ institution as Christian and”
as American as Davidson to pre-
vent its students from enjoying
with their parents at home this
holiday which stems from the very
heart of our heritage.

Thanksgiving is a family day
as well as a church and national

one. It is an old American’
traditition for families to

gather on this last Thoreday inf
November to express gratitude

to God for his abundant mercies
and blessings. Surely if ever we

Americans had reason to. be
thankful, we have today. As the
whole world is hungry, ruined,
and in desperation, we enjoy
freedom, peace and plenty,

And what do Davidson students
do on that day? Acknowledge it
with an absolute minimum of time!
Surely the influence of this college
if-great for the building of char-
acter in her students but what a
poor example is set by failure to
attach enough importance to that
day set apart by our founding
fathers, for us to join about a table
with those whom we love and
praise our Father in Heaven for
our many blessings.
