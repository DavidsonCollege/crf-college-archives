Marie Tuite, the NCAA’s as-
sistant director of championships
and liaison for the men’s soccer
championships (to be held at
Davidson December 4 and 6), vis-
ited Davidson for the first time
Wednesday, and apparently liked
what she saw, “The people at
Davidson are well organized,” she
said. “But the mostimportant thing
is they are taking great pride in
hosting the event and it’s being
reflected in their work so far.”

Fortunately for soccer coach
Charlie Slagle, director of ath-
letic promotions Pat Millen and
athletic director Terry Holland,
the three men who spearheaded
Davidson’s successful bid for the
event, their enthusiasm has been
matched by area soccer fans. In’
promoting the championships,
Davidson aggressively courted
the legions of young fans in the
region, and they responded. The
last of the 5,350 reserved seats
was snatched up in the last week
of August.

A popular tactic in hosting
events of this type is to sell blocks
of a hundred or more tickets to
corporations, which may or may
not use them. According to Hol-
land, because of the strong local
response, Davidson has not done
that at all.

But all that interest has cre-
ated an unforeseen problem. Al-
ready, a waiting list for more seats
(which don’teven exist yet) is over
1,000 names strong, and the issue
of whether temporary seats should
be added is a touchy one around

NCAA Soccer Championships

course, would love to open up the
event to as many people as pos-
sible, butrealizes that other factors
are involved. Holland, with whom
the decision ultimately rests, is
wary of adding to Richardson
Field’s capacity because he fears it

will “take away from those
who did buy tickets early.”

The town of Davidson, after
all, was not designed with events
of this size in mind. When
Davidson hosted Duke in basket-
ball three years ago, many people
inthe crowd ofalmost 6,000 missed
a substantial portion of the game
because “the line for parking at
Baker stretched all the way to the
interstate. Holland’s fear is that
such a scenario will occur again
this December, and his fear is a
reasonable one. There are bound to
be logistical problems simply in
servicing the original crowd of

ple

5,350; adding more seats may only
be asking for more trouble.

Furthermore, even ifa couple

thousand temporary seats are
brought in, Holland suspects that
the issue of who would get those
seats would became a “political
football.” People in the Davidson
community feel thatthey have been
cheated because they had only a
few days to buy tickets upon re-
turning to school, but soccer fans
in more distant parts of the coun-
try are angry because they had no
chance at all to buy tickets, since
Davidson never had the chance to
market the event on a national
basis.

Pragmatically, Holland has
altered the issue a little bit. The
issue, he says, is “How can people
get to see the gamé live?” CBS
televises the event, but only on a
delayed basis, so Holland pres-
ently is negotiating with regional
cable outfits like Prime and
SportSouth in the hopes that they

will air a live broadcast. His ratio-
nale is that, whether in person or
on television, the important thing
is to see the game as it happens.
Maybe so, but from the Davidson
student’s perspective, it would re-
ally anger me to have to watch the
games on TV in the common room
in Duke while the action went on
live a hundred yards away. The
best advice for Davidson students
who want to see the action in per-
son is to get on the waiting list
immediately and make aloud noise
for added seating.

A Davidson volleyball player spikes for a point in win over High Point

Logan Stars in Volleyball
Win Over High Point

By Taylor Smith

The Davidson volleyball tcam
opened its season Wednesday night
looking like a team that had been
practicing together for years. Play-
ing behind the leadership of sopho-
more setter Lori Logan, the Wild-
cats posted an impressive victory,
winning their best of five match
against High Point in three games,
posting scores of 15-3, 15-5, 15-8.

Before the game, the team had
some ‘doubts about how well it
would play together. “There have
been a lot of changes in the last
little while,” said new coach
Carolyn Blake. “But I’m really

pleased with the team chemistry”

and how well they came together.”

After playing in her first game
as a, Wildcat, freshman Michelle
Augustin was also pleased with
the way the team played. “We

didn’t know how we would do, but
everything just seemed to click
together. We’ve been working a
lot on passing in practice, not
spending a lot of time on offense.
But the passing really paid off, and
our offense came with it.”

“Tt was a great team effort,”
said Logan, who had 29 assists.and
four service aces. “The great pass-

 ingreally helped me in running the

offense. I think we have a lot to
look forward to.”

The Wildcats played a con-
trolled match, with every member
of the team contributing. Junior
Amy Howard led the Wildcats with
10 kills, and senior Jennie Wagner
was right behind her with eight.
Davidson played in the Coastal
Carolina Tournament in Conway,
S.C. Friday and Saturday.

tional power N.C. State, as well as
games with powers outside the re-
gion such as Maryland, Dayton
and Radford, and a date with Divi-
sion II power Elon. Despite the
very difficultschedule, Hundley is
confident in his team’s ability to
challenge some of the best teams
in the area. “I think we'll be able to
score against just about anybody
on our schedule,” he said.

According to Hundley, pre-
season workouts have gone quite
well. The freshmen have been ac-
cepted redily by the upperclass-
men, and the team has established

good chemistry. The ‘Cats’ only
weakness appcars to be on defense.
However, Hundley feels that his
defensive problems are only a mat-
ter of finding the right combina-
tions of players who play well to-
gether. When all the kinks are
worked out, Hundley hopes to find
the Wildcats ranked in the top ten
in the Southeast, by far the tough-
est region in collegiate women’s
soccer.

Davidson opencd its scason
Saturday afternoon with a5-1 past-
ing of Qucens in Charlotte. They
will remain on the road for three
more games before their home
opener September 20 against
Catawba.
