Jump, Little Children

Jump, Little Children
will play Richardson Field

By Kate GREENE
& JASON SCHMIDT
Guest Writers

Before all of you returned to
the haven of NASCAR racing, we
ventured to the yuppie terror of
Jack Straws to preview the sounds
of the first concert on campus,
Jump, Little Children.

While the venue is a sound
catastrophe, the band was funky,
eclectic and musically wild. Ac-
cordion, mandolin, cello, upright
bass, harmonica,.and other musi-
cal oddities compose the multifari-
ous sounds of J,LC.

Waffling between mellow,
folky melodies and demonic rap-
like sounds, these Charleston “chil-
dren” perform a show that is satiat-
ing. Musically they travel all
ground; at times the drums solo, at
others, they provide a completely
danceable beat. Atothers, the elec-
tric guitar wails in a heavy metal
fashion or simply provides the
background sound.

Visually they entertain with
the expertise of all true kindergart-
ners. One of their members, in-
spired by junior Brit Taylor, jumps
in the bounciest of fashions while
swinging an enormous stand up
bass made suddenly weightless.

Another member, possessed
by demons, changes facial patterns
with every note and sports a neo-
mango silk shirt. Crowd-wise,
they'd inspire jumping beans.
During their three encores, the
band’s spontaneous jams spurred
on even the tiredest of fans till the

wee hour of 2 a.m.

J,LC will be performing on
Richardson Field on Thursday,
August 29. Gates open at 8 p.m.
The show is free for students, fac-
ulty, and staff; admission is $5 for

the general public. Bring your toys.

and come prepared to dance.
