Many students come to
Davidson with the intention of
someday going to medical school.

However, not too many people
know that there once was a medi-
cal school right here.

In his recent article “Grave
Robbing - An Unusual Avocation,”
local writer Ken Brotherton un-
covers Davidson medical college’s
ghoulish past.

The limitation of resources at
a small college like Davidson is
not a-novel problem.

. At the turn of the twentieth
century, Davidson had difficulty
securing a supply of cadavers for
its medical students. ©

The solution? Grave robbing.

exploits engaged in by a student

The College was even the sub-
ject of a law suit when a local man
recognized his father’s skull on a
windowsill.

Brotherton’s description of
Davidson’s grave robbing past and
the other articles in his Lake
Norman Serires earned him the
presitigious D.T. Smithwick News-
paper and Magazine Article
Award.

The award was presented to
him last month at the 55th annual
meeting of the North Carolina So-

The Davidson Cemetery.
