PRIZE ESSAY CONTEST
OPEN TO STUDENTS

The Institute of International Education
is conducting a prize essay contest among
undergraduate students on “The Cancellation
of the Allied Debts.” By undergraduate
student is meant one who, in a college or
scientific school, is doing the work prescribed
for the degree of bachelor, or its technical
equivalent. Hence, it is seen that practically
all the students of Davidson will be eligible
in the contest.

The merits of the essays will be judged
by a committee consisting of five of the most
well-known American financiers, and the
awards of the prizes will be made May 1,
1923. The three best essays will receive
prizes of $150, $100 and $50, respectively,

These essays should not exceed 5,000
words nor be less than 3,000 words, and they
must be in the hands of the judges by March
15, 1923. Any student desiring additional
information concerning the conest may ob-
tain such from Liston Elkins or Bill Heston.

SUMMER TRAINING CAMPS
FOR SOUTHERN CITIZENS

Word has been received from Capt. Dono-
van Yeuell, United States Army, acting C.
M. T. C. officer of the Fourth Corps Area,
which includes the States of Georgia, Ala-
bama, Florida, North Carolina, South Caro-
lina, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee,
that elaborate plans are now under way for
the continuance of the government summer
camps for young men which proved’so popu-
lar last summer and the. summer before.

Nearly three thousand young men received
an outing at government expenses last year,
some at Fort Barrancas, Fla., on the Gulf of
Mexico, and some at Camp McClellan, in
the rolling, wooded hills, near Anniston, Ala.
The following is a typical example of many
letters being received from last year’s stu-
dents,

“I attended Camp McClellan the summer
of 1922. I can testify for your benefit as
well as others, that this month of: training
did me: more good than any other training
that I have so far received.”

According to present plans, camps are to
be held this year at Camp McClellan, Ala.,
Fort Barrancas, Fla., and Fort Bragg, N. C.
The branches of instruction offered may be
slightly different from those of last year, but
in the main will be in the same branches,
which includes infantry, cavalry, field artil-
lery, engineers and coast artillery.

” The courses offered incinde a basic red
course, which gives fundamental training but

does not instruct in any particular branch:of
the service ; advanced red course, which gives

basic instruction in branches desired; white
course (for which graduates of last year’s
red course who were certified as eligible for
admission to white course are qualified), fits
student to be a non-commissioned officer in
the organized reserves or the national guard;
and the blue course (for which graduates of
last year’s white course who were certified
as eligible for admission to blue course are
qualified if of the proper age and possess
necessary educational qualifications), which
fits candidate for commission in the officers’
reserve corps.

The age limits are the same as for last
year, 17 to 25 for the two red courses, 18
to 26 for the white course, and 18 to 27 for
the blue course. These age limits do not
apply to those who attended a citizens’ mili-
tary training camp in 1921. Veterans of the
world war may be accepted up to 35 years
of age.

Although formal application blanks have
not been received, young men of proper qual-
ifications will find it to their advantage to
mail requests for applications to the acting

C. M. T. C. officer, Fort McPherson, Ga.,
at as early a date as possible. Although it
will be possible to accommodate more than
fifty per cefit more candidates than were ac-
commodated last year, it is expected that
many more will apply than can be admitted.
By having your request for application on
file, you will have opportunity to receive ap-
plication blank early. All who desire appli-
cations should state their date of birth, and
former military service of any kind.
