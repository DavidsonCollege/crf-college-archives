Spencer explains budget overruns

Davidson College overdrew
its budget in the 1977 fiscal
year in two main areas: athle-
tics and instructional budgets.
Athletic overruns totaled
$110,000 and the overruns in
the instructional area totaled
$77,000.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. explained: ‘‘Al-
most every budget overruns,
but the important thing is that
you balance overruns in some
areas with underruns in oth-
ers.”

He indicated further that
the exceptionally large over-
runs were not totally unex-
pected, and the faculty had
been informed of them last
year.

Spencer places partial blame
of the large overruns in the

OVERRUNS in the Instructional Budget totaled $77,000 for

1976-77.

Athletic area on an unrealis-
tically low budget.

““We were directed by the
trustees to put big-time bas-
ketball back on the track. The
Budget allocated was not re-
alistic for what the trustees
asked for.”

“We went way over on our
recruiting budgets in football
and basketball,” he added.

To remedy this problem
Spencer said that the 1977-78
Athletic budget has been in-
creased.

Spencer says it is difficult to

pinpoint where the overruns in
the Instructional budget oc-
curred.

He explains the Athletic
budget overruns for big-time
basketball because it will pos-
sibly be a money-making pro-
position. ‘‘The trustees have
directed us to put our money
in the front end and see
whether it will pay off.”

Despite the overruns, the
Athletics budget makes up
only nine percent of the Col-
lege’s total operating budget.

Spencer declined to specu-

late on what percentage bas-
ketball drew from total Athle-
tic budget which was
$671,781.03 but he admitted it
was substantial.

“This figure includes many
things,’’ Spencer explained:
‘tall the coach’s salaries, secre-
tarial help, publicity, recruit-
ing, equiptment, etc...So you
can see it is a pretty big
operation down there.”

Income received from the
Wildcat Club, which is inde-
pendent of the College, is not
included in the school’s ath-
letic budget. Most of this
money goes to suppliment the
monies awarded to football
players on the basis of need.
But all sports at Davidson
receive some funding from the
club.

In the past Davidson gave
52 full football scholarships.
When this number was cut,
the Wildcat Club decided to
help those players who de-
monstrate a need.

Gift income defrays education costs

By GEORGE MURDAUGH

While the total cost of a
Davidson education in 1976-77
per student was $6,500, the
comprehensive fee to students
and parents was $4,390.

Where does the remaining
$1,942 per student (almost 30
percent of the total cost) come
from?

This. difference is make up
by annual gifts from alumni,
parents, friends, corporations,
and foundations, as well as
endowment and trust income.

Soliciting gifts and other
types of income ‘“‘is a very

integral part of any private
college’s activity,’’ notes Vice-

President for Development”

Duane A. Dittman.

“Fortunately for Davidson
this process is not a question
of survival as it is for some
other colleges.”’

Raising funds is a co-ordi-
nated effort directed at alum-
ni, parents, and friends. There
are approzimately 11,500 liv-
ing Davidson alumni.

The College has several
hundred ‘‘friends’”’ on its mail-
ing list.

Dittman estimates that
roughly 40 percent of alumni,
parents, and friends give mon-

ey gifts to the College.

In fiscal year 1977 the total
gift income was $1,600,585.
Alumni giving ($527,531) was
the largest source of this
income, comprising nearly 33
percent of the total.

Bequests accounted for 20
percent of total giving while
corporations gave gifts
amounting to 13 percent of the
total.

Churches gave $128,732 or &
percent of the total gift in-
come.

Other sources were parents.
friends, foundations, and the
Duke Endowment.

Funds from these and other

Incoming funds

Wh ere

sources defer educational costs
and make a Davidson educa-
tion possible for many stu-
dents whose families could not
afford it otherwise. Most
schools with which Davidson
competes academically cannot
offer their students a compa-
rable financial bargain.

Continued generous giving
and income from the endow-
ment also means that David-
son does not have to borrow
money (and therefore pay
interest).

This year the Davidson
comprehensive fee is $4,665
which includes $3,050 for tui-
tion. The rest of the fee
consists of room, board, laun-
dry and other miscellaneous
costs.

to a fund that is commonly

kept, in reserve for any unfore-
seen expenses that might arise

‘‘We are never going to
make any money on football,”
Spencer commented, ‘‘but I
like our football as it is: low
pressure, a pleasant Saturday
afternoon for friends, alumni,
and students.”

Spencer detailed the bene-
fits big-time basketball

brought to the college. He
pointed out that during the
height of Davidson’s basket-
ball success the team brought
in enough money to pay for
itself.

But he added, ‘‘It is more
than just money. The Trustees
