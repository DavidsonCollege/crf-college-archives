At the Courtroom

Seated behind a desk at the
front of the courtroom,
Mecklenburg County
Magistrate Allie Burnette,
who is the subject of a con-
troversial courtwatching
study, turned from her
typewriter and faced the
plaintiff, a representative of
Little Rock Apartments.

Magistrate (to Plaintiff):
Tell me about yours.

(The Magistrate looked
down at the written com-
plaint.)

Plaintiff: I would like
judgement for possession (of
the defendant’s apartment)
only.

(The defendant, Michael
Johnson, walked to the
Magistrate’s desk.) __

Magistrate (to Defendant) :
What about your rent Mr.
Johnson?

Defendant: I'm just recen-
tly out of the hospital, and I’m
waiting for my disability
check from the army. I’ve also
been going to school for two
months.

Plaintiff: You live in a
basic rent apartment? $867
Your money should be in by
the end of the month. If you
can’t get money in, you're just
going to have to move. We’re
government subsidized and
have to have our money in by
the 22nd.

Defendant: I’m going to call
if my check isn’t here by next
week. .

Plaintiff: You can’t give
any idea about when to expect
- therent?

Magistrate: Get the rent
paid as soon as possible. I'll
give judgement. Little Rock
will wait.

(The defendant leaves the
courtroom. )

Plaintiff: Lillie Jones...

Magistrate: Is she still out
there? She’s been fighting this
for a year.

Plaintiff: The government
gets on us because the report
gets held up. They (the defen-
dants) come in with new cars,
new furniture. You can’t be
lenient. Everyone should pay
their rent. I’m going to try to
cut down on coming in to see
you.

Courtwatch Report

This is an excerpt from an
affadavit written by a David-
son College student who ser-

The Charlotte Observer
printed the Magistrate story
as a lead article in the Local
News Section last Sunday.

The report drawn up by the
courtwatching group con-
cludes that Allie Burnette
should not be reappointed on
the grounds of (a) ‘‘willful and
persistent failure to perform
his :(her) duties’? and (b)
“conduct prejudicial to the ad-
ministration of justice that
brings the judicial office into
disrepute.”’

The report gave seven other
recommendations which dealt
with improving the selection,
training and review of

of justice in the magistrate
courts by changing the laws
governing the system,’’ stated
Kirby.

Allie Burnette was con-
tacted by phone. She said that
she had been advised to refer
all questions to Judge Kenneth
Griffin, her superior.

District Court Judge Griffin,
who was responsible for
supervising the magistrates
over the past months, denoun-
ced the report as something
that ‘‘belonged in the gar-
bage.”’

“I have appeared in Mrs.
Burnette’s court personally,
and I have sent some lawyers
down from time to tome to ob-

1. Magistrate Burnette
should not be reappointed.

2. If Magistrate Burnette is
reappointed, the Judicial
Standards Committee should
investigate the allegations
made in the report.

Six Problem Areas

The courtwatchers’ report
named six ‘‘problem areas’’
concerning Magistrate Bur-
nette’s actions on the bench.

One of these problem’ areas

‘is exemplified in the case

article. According to the
report, the magistrate

Conclusions Of PIRG/ACLU Report

This report concludes that there are
features df the present system of magistrate
appointment and discipline which have not
been exercised to the extent that is possible
for the administration of justice. These
features are: i

1.. The chief judge of the district court of
Mecklenburg County should set up a system
of training for civil magistrates that is more
comprehensive than their present training,

2. The magistrates should be paid the
present legal limit in salary as established by
Article 16 of the second 1973 amendment ef-
fective July 1, 1974 (N.C.G.S. 7A-172), in or-
der to attract well-qualified citizen: to the
job. This salary is $10,074 per annum.

Further, the Mecklenburg County
legislative delegation should work to see that
the legislature enacts new statutes affecting

«the following aspects of the law governing

magistrates in North Carolina:

1. Higher qualifications for the office of
magistrate should be established.

2. Higher standards of training, including
the passing of a stringent examination,
should be legislated and adhered to.

3. The statutory maximum for magistrate
salaries should be raised in order to attract
persons wih higher qualifications to the of-
fice.

4. Methods of accountability should be built
into the magistrate’s courts. Consideration
should be given to making them courts of
record or to requiring periodic observations
by the chief district judge.

5. The General Assembly should enact a
statute requiring the magistrate to announce
and explain his disposition of cases to the
litigants and to announce and explain the
requirements for appealing and staying

Eleven cases in the report
Stated that Burnette did not
receive or ask for evidence of
forfeiture provisions or ten-
day demand notices (in sum-
mary ejectment cases based
on claims of non-payment)
and of forfeiture provisions
and notices to quit the
premises (in other ejectment
cases).

In three trials Burnette
raised outside of her jurisdic-
tion. In two of these cases the
plaintiff claimed more than
$500, which is the jurisdic-
