picketing which had until
Tuesday accompanied the
boycott, but said that it had
brought ‘‘a number of serious
problems out in the open.”

“Té's not the best way of
dealing with this problem
(the barber shop). the im-
mediate problem. It's not
going to make Ralph John-
son change his mind," said
Abbott.

Abbott termed the Monday
night deadline ‘‘unrealistic
in light of the particular legal
problems involved."'

Freshman Gary Cash, one
of the two Senators voting
against the reselution, ex-
pressed doubts concerning
the methods used.

“I felt we would be more
hurting his family than his
belief,’’ he said.

Freshman President Ed
Dobbs, who. voted for the
resolution, also had the same’
reservations. “A lot of stu-
dents are playing games with
another man’s livelihood,” he
said.

‘Alpha’ Reaches To Omega

As Valuable Entertainment

A REVIEW

The success of ‘‘Alpha, an
entertainment’’ is perhaps
best indicated by the curtain
call it received Tuesday in
chapel, from a usually slee-
py captive audience which
responded heartily to this
unique production.

Exactly what “Alpha” was
is still undetermined, but
from the initial chaotic tan-
gle of arms and legs it was
indeed unique. It was storm
of stage effects unleashed
upon an unsuspecting audi-
ence, the dexterous use of
the human form to tell a
story and then the contrast
of the beautiful and the vul-
gar, the ridiculous and the
sublime, to point a grim fin-
ger toward the outcome of
that familiar story.

A production which can
at once incorporate Tolstoy
and Playtex brassieres, or
“America” followed by
Country Joe and the Fish,
has an inherent diversity
about it and enough satiric
barbs to amuse any observ-
er of our civilization.

There was a message be-
hind it all, and Tuesday's
chapel audience seemed
aware of it as the battle se-
quence brought “Alpha”
back to the chaos in which it
began: it was an essentially
humorous delivery of a not-
so-funny reminder of our
age.

If it is necessary to label
“Alpha,” call it a revue; a
cross between ‘‘Beyond the
Fringe’ and the Rowan and
Martin Laugh In which is in

tended to keep the audience
off guard. The juxtaposition
of the comic and ghastly is
a new technique in both mo-
vies and the theatre, and un-
der the direction of Mr. Ru-
pert Barber, the Drama 32
Class showed it can work.

Its creation by the class
was a product of brainstorm-
ing, the selection and rejec-
tion of random ideas from
sixteen fertile imaginations
which then integrated what
they conceived into a unified
production.

Dr. Barber foresees more
of this sort of original work,
which entailed not only the
acting of twelve of the class’

members, but the extremely
able sound and light work of
four more. If it is true that
a committee never created a
work of art, then this is not
art—but regardless, and as
Tuesday's presentation dem-
onstrated, it opens an excit-
ing new dimension for the
theatre.

Driesell
May Sell

His Den

Davidson Basketball Coach
Lefty Driesell revealed Wed-
nesday night that he may
sell either whole or part in-
terest in his Wildcat Den, a
Davidson restaurant.

“I might sell it if I find
the right person to sell it
to.”’ Driesell said. “The prob-
lem is that I can't seem to
find a person to manage the
place.”

“If 1 could find someone
who would serve as man-
ager I might sell him a part
interest, or I might sell him
the whole thing.'’ Driesell
continued. ‘Right now I just
don't know.” .

Driesell bought the restau-
rant last September from
Mrs. Margaret Pratt, who
had formerly operated the
Coliege Restaurant in the
building.

of Halifax, Va. ‘‘They seem
to take a greater interest in
the people here."’

“I dike the atmosphere
here. That's the most strik-
ing thing about the college,”
added. Ronnie Williams of
Rayetteville.

On the other hand, opin
fons about the availability of
social life at Davidson varied
among the students. ‘If you
think about the proximity of
girls’ schools around here,”’
said Raymond Swetanburg of
Gainesville, Ga., “it isn’t too
bad.”

But Donald Powell of King
of Prussia. Pa., said that he
thought the campus was
“quiet, almost too quiet.”
He added, ‘Davidson seems

kind of isolated. and Char-
lotte isn't really that big of a
city. You can't do much in a
city that size."

The applicants’ attitude to-
ward the college's admis-
sions policy on Negroes was
summed up by one student
who said, “It isn't flexible
enough. It’s pretty much in
line with the whole. attitude

GARRETT ELECTED

The Young Republicans
Club passed resolutions cail-
ing for an end to the rights
of students within colleges
and universities in their
monthly meeting last Wed-
nesday.

YRC. officers were also
elected for next year. None
of the candidates faced oppo-
sition.

Those elected were Sen
Garrett, president; Brevard
Wallace, vice-president
Hunter Dalton, treasurer;
Tom Wheatley: secretary;
Bill Vass, assistant secre-
tary.

The petition on student
rights asserts that students
enter into a contractual rel-
tionship with the college vol-
untarily in which their only
right is to demand fulfill-
ment of the agreement, which
is that the college supply the
educational opportunities of
higher caliber.

The college is entitled to
dictate the use of its prop
erty by setting academic
standards, entrance require-
ments, curfews, or any other
regulations it sees fit.

In the draft petition, aboli-
tion is urged on the grounds
that a voluntary army would
be more efficient, and better
able to cope with demands
of modern warfare.

not only the specific rules
governing student conduct
but also the philosophy upon
which the rules are based.
Its preamble says the pur-
pose of the proposed code is
“to encourage individuals to
develop responsible judg-
ment capable of directing
their conduct with a mini-
mum of specific prohibition.”

The report consists of four
parts: the Davidson College
Code of Responsibility, in-
cluding the ‘preamble: the
Judiciary section; the Phil-
osophy of Discipline; and the
amendment procedure.

“This code is speaking
through a philosophy of be-
havior rather than through
specific injunctions,”’ said
senior Mike Carroll, chair-
man of the committee.

According to the report, an
elaborate system of rules
such as Davidson presently
has “might promote a sur-
face conformity to the stand-
ards of behavior desired,
but would not effectively
serve to develop the maturi-
ty of character which is the
aim of the college.”

Specific rules are included
in the code “‘only when they
seem necessary to prevent
actions which would infringe

The first four parts of the
code _ present philosophic
statements concerning the.
academic, financial and so-

student and the nature of the
honor system. The fifth sec-
tion states the students’ re-

the property and rights of

The CRAP report will be

and the faculty for approval

groups, it will be presented
to the trustees for consider-

According to Carroll, the

which will require minor
changes in both the student
and faculty constitutions to
become effective.
