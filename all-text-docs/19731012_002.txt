Kincaid Seeks Office
For Student Counseling

By HARRIETT HODGES
News Editor

Career Service Director Ran-
dal R. Kincaid Jr. proposed the
creation of a new office for
student counseling in this
week's meeting of the student
Senate.

Kincaid said that the new of-
fice would be part of the Student
Counseling Center and thus the
responsibility of William B.
Hight. Functions of the office
would include testing and coun-
seling, direction of the carrer-
service program, and summer
internship placement. ac-
cording to Kincaid.

“I believe that Davidson has
an obligation to aid students in
vocational decisions. Students
should have an opportunity to
try out prospective careers,"’
he said.

Vince Rabil moved that the
Senate support Kincaid's
proposal. The motion was
tabled untill next week's
meeting. .

Senate parlementarian Todd
Eades introduced a resolution
that the SGA encourage the
Board of Trustees to accept the
Spencer Commission Report's

recommendations concerning
requirements for faculty
tenure

According to the report for
mal religious requirements for
members of the faculty and ad
ministration would be deleted

The Senate unanimously ac-
cepted Eades’ resolution.

The group passed an amend-
ment to the Bylaws
election of cheerleaders. Now
male cheerleaders will be selec-
ted in tryouts rather than by
popular vote.

Also passed was an amend-
ment to the Motor Vehicle
Regulations which will lower
the price of parking permits
from $3 to $1 effective October
11. In addition, the group voted
to authorize the business office
to issue refunds of $2 to all
students who purchased tickets
prior to October 11

Miles Ward and Todd Eades
reported on psychological coun-
seling in this week's meeting.

“The Senate needs a committee
to talk to Dr. Hall regularly to
keep things straight between
him and the SGA,” Ward said .
He added that Hall will meet
with the Senate later this term.

Blain Butner reported on the
Possibility of night exams. But-
ner said that there are many
problems involved in night
exams including lack of stu-
dents to man the exam center.

Also in Tuesday's meeting the
Senate appointed Freshman
Senator Juhe Deck to the
Senate Executive Committee
and confirmed the appointment
ot Edgar Weir, Neal Lenhoff

and Brad Davis to the Residen-
ce Hall Counce) ;
