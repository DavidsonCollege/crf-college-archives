Davidson opened its soccer season
by dropping a hard-fought game
to a strong High Point team, 2-1.
Davidson was seriously handicapped
by the loss of Al Bixler, star for-

and had to be removed from the

High Point exhibited a well-knit

Prayin’ Colonels from Centre
Playing listlessly for the first
two quarters, the "Cats held a six-
point lead at half time, but Coach
Doc Newton must have told them
something in the dressing room, for
they came back scrapping in the
third chukker to score 14 points
and put the game on ‘ice. Then tHe
first team took a well-earned rest
and turned the job over to the subs
who delivered a fourth tally in the
closing minutes of the fray.

Dennis Scores

Davidson received the opening
kickoff and was’ unable to gain
chiefly because of the great de-
fensive work of Lee Grouszkowski,
husky tackle who was a thorn in
Davidson's side all afternoon. Af-
ter a kick by Armfield, the Colo-
nels marched 55 yards to the ’Cats’
20 yard stripe where Davidson's
forward walf rose up on its hind
legs and held for downs. After that
first march Centre seemed to have
shot its bolt and made only one
more serious threat. Davidson got
a break a moment later when the
wing-footed Lafferty lugged back
a punt from his 34 to the visitors’
30 and the Colonels were penalized
15 more yards for clipping on the
play. Corbin and Dennis alternated
at carrying the leather and it was
the latter who ‘plunged over from
the two-foot line for the first score
of the game. Just before the end
of the half Centre made its last
bid, desperately trying to break
through a stubborn defense and fill-
ing the air with aerials, Van Huss
snagged one on the Davidson 24
and then another over the goal line,
but was out of bounds and the
score was nullified. Dennis inter-
cepted a toss and galloped 65 yards
with it before Stahl dragged him
down, but the play was called back
and a five yard penalty inflicted on
Davidson. for offside. With seconds
left in the half Corbin flagged a do-
or-die heave and brought it to his
24 yard line.

Lafferty Stars

In the third period the Wildcats
turned on the heat and Centre wilt-
ed before the powerful attack. With
his blockers tearing great holes in
the Kentucky line Lafferty almost
single-handed toted the ball to his
opponents’ 22 and hurled a pass to
Armfield for the latter’s . eighth
touchdown of the season. Tom Cor-
bin stepped into the limelight a
minute later when he intercepted
another pass, putting Davidson in
scoring position on Centre’s § 33.
After two incomplete passes, Dav-

fourteenth; McFadyen (D), fif- idson pulled off an almost “perfect
teenth. (Continued on Page 6)
