sistant to the president, the com-
mittee will be “trying to gain a
detailed perspective of the op-
eration of the college.”

Sackett also stated that when

the committee arrives on cam-
pus, they will already have a

thorough knowledge of the col-
lege through the comprehensive
self-study report. The report was
released to this committee on
Oct. 21.

“It is amazing what they (the
committee) will find out by just
talking to faculty, students and
administration.”” Sackett con-
tinued. “They have tremendous
access to everything on cam-
pus.”’

In speaking about the student
Interviews, Sackett said that
most of them will take place on
an individual basis, but the com-
mittee will be eating many times
with the students. They will talk
to students while waiting in line
at the College Union and also
while eating at fraternity houses.

The committee will use the
knowledge gained while visiting
the campus to evaluate the Self-
Study Report and to evaluate
the college. Then this seven-man
committee will present its report
to the SACU which will then de-
cide on accreditation.

The report itself consists of
nine chapters which cover all
aspects of the college and col-
lege life. Sackett said that it is
mostly a report of the present
state of the college and contains
some general outlines for the fu-
ture.

lic, Sackett said that at the pre-
sent only the evaluation com-

mittee, several members of the}:

administration and the steering
committee have copies or are
familiar with its contents.

When the committee makes its
visit next week, the faculty will
receive copies of the report.

However, each faculty member|}

is already familiar with the
particular chapter that his com-
mittee drew up.

Copies will also be released to
the Board of Visitors and the
Board of Trustees at that time.

Brown Gets ‘Deals’
In Tour Of Far East

By HEYWARD CARTER
Davidsonian Feature Editor

It was “good deals” all
around this summer — for
junior George Brown, for
the State Department and
for two Presbyterian mis-
sionaries in Korea.

This, at least, is Brown’s opin-
ion of the tour he took this sum-
mer of the Far East. Sponsored
by the National Student Associa-
tion and completely financed by
the State Department, Brown's
trip was more than a tour: it
was an experiment in relations
and the interchange of ideas be-
tween students of Japan, Korea
and Hong Kong and students of
the United States.

By this trip of five weeks in
the Orient, American students
got a chance to meet with their
counterparts in these three coun-
tries and to give them a better
undersianding of American col-
lege life and American life in
general, and vice-versa.”

Six students representing ‘‘a
good geographical distrioution
of the U. S." were chosen by the
NSA to represent their country
on this tour. Two girls and four
boys (all of whom excep: Brown
had completed their undergrad-
uate work) who were in some
way interested or connected with
the Far East were picked from
a large number of applicants

This was the first of what is
hoped to be a regular series of
trips contingent on the State De-

NSA, although a similar group
was touring the Philippines at
the same time that Brown’s
group was in the Far East.

Brown says that it was ‘‘an

attitudes of other students to-

Annual To Emphasize
Picture, informality

By ROB

POWELL

Davidsonlan Staff Writer-

Smile! You are on the Quips and Cranks camera. Yes,
photographers from Quips and Cranks seem to be every-
where on the Davidson campus this year.

The reason, says Arnie Snider,
editor, is that the annual staff
this year is especially cancen-
trating on good pictures.

Of course; there is much more
to the annual than merely tak.
ing pictures. Snider made up the
layout this summer, and his
staff is working constantly on
putting it together in the pack-
age that Snider hopes students
will receive in the -middle of next
May.

In an interview Snider said
that in contrast to last year the
theme will be more dominant,
the emphasis will be on inform-
asity and the pictures will con-
centrate not on who is doing but
what they are-dbving.

He further stated that his idea
of a good armual is one that
sticks to school life and does not
try to criticize the world situa-
tion. ,

Editor Snider's staff consists
of Woody Coleman and Ed
Dwelle, assistant editors: Buck

ther to the Observer Printing
House for completion.

The cover, says Snider will be
“original and although things
are a little slow sometimes, he
is sure that it will be ready for
the students on time.
