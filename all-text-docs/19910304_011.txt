“but if students begin to prepare
early enough, they will be able to
find a job of interest and value to
them, although it may not be their
ideal job right away.”

The Careers Office suggests that

students begin career counseling

asearly as freshman year “to begin

the process of finding out who they

are and what they want to doin the
future.” |
Moreover, summer experience
is stressed as a way of exploring
interests and options. The office
offers a four-year guide which
outlines the steps toward develop-
ing a career plan. In retrospect

less difficulties this year if] hadn’t
gone abroad last year and had had
time to begin putting a resumé
together earlier.”

The ‘Grifters’ is the new movie
by Steven Frears. He brought the
world of inner-city London to the
screen in “Sammy and Rosie get
Laid,” and left a generation de-
pressed with “Dangerous Laisons.”
Now, Frears has dedicated some
money and the talent of John Cu-
sack and Anjelica Houston to re-
construct a time and place from
which nothing, ‘no not even light
can escape. Frears films the world
of grift, those who do, those who
don’t, and those that teeter on the
side of the dank well. Black is the
exposé before us. And the hell
grips, the horror astounds. Mother,
mother, Blood! Blood!

If the filmgoer had known the
grift was so bad she wouldn’t have
gone to the movie, she would have
sat down in the mud and started
raising a grift treatment center with
her bare hands--crafting and sculpt-

ing her way out of the mud into a
building, a mud-stucco affair with
ared trim roof. She would tried to
stop the grift in all its forms. She
wouldn’ thave had time fora movie,
she wouldn’t have had time for a
second thought. Even as she sent
out fliers to decaying grifters,even
as her back grew twisted from
walking and doing, éven as her
tongue grew sores and her lips
ached for liquid solace she’d know
she was doing what she could to
stop the grift, and so will you.
This movie will tell you what
grift is and you won’t like it. This
movie will make you feel the grift,
the way of the grift, the what of the
griftand the who of the grift. If you
think you know a grifter, turn him
in. If you think you’re a grifter
seek help, you’re in a bad film.
John Cusack is a grifter, there’s no
denying it John. This grifter, lies,
this grifter cheats, this grifter cons
‘cause that’s what the grifts all
about. If you know a grifter turn
her. Anjelica Houston plays a
grifter. She’s been piled high in
grift since John was born. She
works for the mob. (my sister got
into the grift. She never got out)
John’s girlfriend works too, for the
griftthatis. Everyone in this movie
is covered in grift; the slime of it.

Cinema Paradiso Is Beneissimo

By Lelia Salisbury

Movie magic is alive and well in
Giuseppe Tornatore’s Cinema
Paradiso. Tornatore explores
growing up, relationships, love and
the golden era of the silver screen
through the eyes of a mischievous
youngster. —

Toto is a typical Italian boy of
seven--deaf to adult voices and

-every parent and teacher’s night-

mare. Heisalso inexplicably drawn
to the crumbling building that is
the Cinema Paradiso, an old struc-
ture located in the middle of a
sleepy Italian village inatime when
movies were still censored by the
town priest. Schoolkids playing

_ hooky, wives, old men and drunk-

ards alike all gatherat the Paradiso
to lose themselves in the world of
film.

Toto and his movie-mentor Al-
fredo are fixtures at the magical
Paradiso, and they lead each other

through the process of growing up
and growing old with wonderful
poignancy. This is the kind of
movie that gives you real charac-
ters and feelings and makes you
laugh, sniffle and smile at this great
drama called life.

This movie sounds great, you

say, but wait, what do you mean

it’s not in English? I have to watch
the movie and read at the same
time? Yes, this isa subtitled movie,
but as an avid watcher of foreign
films, I have to say that these were
some of the best subtitles I have
ever seen.

After taking a semester of Ital-
ian, I foolishly thought thatI would
understand the main storyline with-
out reading the subtitles. After a,
few minutes, I realized that I was
only picking up words such as si,
beneissimo, and grazie, and thus
the subtitles became a must (let’s
just say that the Italians mumble
when they speak and that no first

Their sing-song theme: cashaway
cashaway cashaway all.

These people are the grift team.
These people plot against each
other. These people lie and then
(the grift will get you by and by)
one of these people is set to die.
Once you find out, you know the
grift is bad. My mama told me
forget the grift, shop around. This
film by Steven Frears tells the up
and down of grift and all that’s left
to say when it’s done, is that griftis
bad, it’s so bad , it’s really bad, it’s
so bad let’s make a movie out of it,
it’s soooooo damn bad, the grift is
bad, it’s two bads bad.

As we walked out of that theatre,
I thought, I can see why they’d
make a film about something as
bad as grift, it’s important that
people see what grift will getthem.
It’s bad. The violence was disgust-
ing, but man, the grift can cut like
a knife. John Cusack doesn’t act
like a con-man, why can’t he de-
liver those lines...the griftman, it’s
the grift.

Even though a boom micro-
phone actually dips halfway into
one of the scenes-- ahhhh I knew it
was the grift. You start making
money on grift, man, and you’re
going down--ask Steve, man, he
wrote the book.

semester Italian student should be
expected to understand what
they’re saying).

The subtitles were just as
funny as the original dialogue; so,
luckily forall the non-Italian speak-
ers, not much is lost in translation.

Another sidenote: you really can
learn things about Italian culture
from watching this movie (pain-
less, huh?).

There are some great scenes
that give you the inside scoop on
the Catholic church, the working
class of the 1940-50’s, and the
Italian tradition of throwing things
they don’t want anymore out the
window on New Year’s Eve.

Subtitles or no, this is a: great
film which just conveniently came
out on videocassette.
