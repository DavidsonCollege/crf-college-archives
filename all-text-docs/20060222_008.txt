NASCAR Technical Institute to take over former Colo house

CoHo eating house announced
last week that this would be its last
semester in operation, citing low
membership and financial troubles
as the reasons for its closure.

The void on the Court may be
quickly filled, however, if recent
talks with the nearby NASCAR
Technical Institute (NTI) prove
fruitful.

Patterson Court administrators
have begun talks with the NTI to
bring a historically racing fraterni-
ty to campus as early as next fall.

While many students have com-

“A historically rac-
ing fraternity will
help foster relations
between racing and
non-racing
students”

plained about the presence of
NASCAR students at parties in the
past, some say the true problem is
the fact that the NTI lacks an
appropriate meeting ground on
the Court.

“Our goal in bringing in a histor-

Library stifles

Things are getting a little nutty
these days on campus, as the staff
of E.H. Little Library has decided
to begin a stronger enforcement of
the “no food and/or drink” policy
in the library and electronic class-
rooms.

This decision

ically racing fraternity is that it will
foster a_ better relationship
between the racing and non-racing
students,” said Patterson Court
Council (PCC) advisor Jay
Howard. “When you look at the
makeup of the other PCC organiza-
tions on campus, you'll find they’re
dominated by just the non-racing
students. That’s something we’d
like to change.”

Howard was first contacted
about this idea by a group of eight
NTI freshmen.

The young men _ impressed
Davidson administrators when
they proposed a fraternity that was
based strictly upon service.

“We can do all sorts of service,”
said Dewayne Rudd, the NTI stu-
dent who headed the proposal.
“We will do oil service, body work
and tire and parts service. Heck,
we can even do engine service.”

Rudd went on to describe a fra-

(Boni community that he hopes

ould demonstrate leadership, fel-
lowship, brotherhood and better
than average gas mileage.

The group is already working to
get a sponsorship from Monster
energy drinks. -

A future NTI fraternity would
provide members with food as well
as social events.

Rudd said a meal plan would
consist of a healthy supply of beef

jerky, frozen dinners and highly
caffeinated drinks with catchy
names.

Some potential members have
suggested themed party ideas like
“Overalls Party,” “Freebird Party”
and “Bring Your Sister Midwinter
Ball.”

Despite support from the
administration and most of the
student body, not everyone thinks
the CoHo house would be best uti-
lized by a NASCAR-based organi-
zation.

Union Board president Tina
Shore ’07 is one of the more vocal
opponents of the NTI fraternity.

“This is a Davidson College facil-
ity, and it should be used to do
Davidson College type things,”
said Shore. “I have proposed that
the Union Recess Committee take
over the house and fill it with
fungames, like 24-hour human Pac
Man, four square, jump rope, bub-
ble blowing contests and candy
time.”

According to Jones, there may

“I’m just completely baffled as to

Partridge is just one of a handful
of students outraged over the
library crackdown.

Sara Mead ’07 even asked for a
stash of peanuts for Christmas,

hoping to enjoy them in the
library.

Ben Whitehead ’06 said he just
enjoys a good hot dog, and he’s not

_ going to let the library stop him.

“Let them fine me,” Whitehead
said. “I’m not going to sit here and
let my right to eat hot dogs in front
of expensive computers be taken
away. These restrictions may work
on sissies drinking Snapple, but
not with me and my dogs,” he
added.

Library. Director Sunny. Torch,
however, is sticking to his decision.

“The wonderful and moderately
priced Union Café has been pro-
viding convenient and affordable
meal alternatives to Davidson stu-

dents for years,” he said. “I assure
you that their recent acquisition of
delicious, individually wrapped,
oven-roasted peanuts is merely a
coincidence in our decision to
crack down on food consumption
in the library.

“The cleaning staff is too often
forced to empty garbage cans con-
taining food and drink products,
and it is just plain disrespectful to
get Cheetos crumbs all over the
books. Something had to be done,”
Torch added.

For now, the library will be mon-
itoring food and drink consump-
tion with an iron fist, while stu-
dents and local businesses struggle
to get some answers.
