ALL TAKE MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD STANDS

Presidential Hopefuls Quizzed On Views

With the possibility of a very tight
race shaping up, and in accordance with
the DAVIDSONIAN'S previous cam-
paign to let the students know the views
of the candidates for major offices, we
sent out questionaires to the three re-
maining candidates for student body
President.

Tom Cutting, John Kuykendall, and
Roy Gilbert answered on paper the fol-
lowing questions.

Q. What one thing do you consider
to be the most important item facing
the Council, and-or what thing as Presi-
dent would you like most to accom-
plish?

A. Generally speaking, none had any
concrete platform. All three wanted to
see more student participation and in-
terest in student government. Kuyken-
dall: “the gap between the student body
_.. and its elected representative body
...,” Cutting: “(make) the student gov-
ernment representative of student
opinion .. .,”’ Gilbert: ‘“‘A greater voice
for students is my aim.”

THREE MAJOR ISSUES

Q. List the three most important (in
your opinion) issues in this campaign?

A. All three listed the proposed
Honor Council, and the drinking rule,
Gilbert listed increased enrollment;

Cutting, keeping the present honor sys-
tem; and Kuykendall said either revi-
sion of election procedure or preferen-
tial bidding.

Q. Do you favor a separate Honor
Council?

A. Gilbert: “I am in favor of an
Honor Council which would be appoint-
ed by your elected student body of-
ficers.” Kuykendall: “Yes,” but he add-
ed that we should investigate what other
schools are doing. He also suggested a
gradual plan whereby the two bodies
would sit together, first the Honor
Council as an advisory body, secondly,
the Council, as an advisory body, and
in the third stage, the Honor Council
“would assume full and lasting respon-
sibility for trial procedures.” Cutting:
“I favor the honor system as it now is

PREFERENTIAL BIODING

Q@. Do you favor preferential bid-
ding?

_ A. Kuykendall and Cutting said
“No.” Gilbert wants more study of the
question.

Q. Do You favor relaxing or chang-
ing the present drinking rule? Exactly
what is your solution to this problem?

WHO WILL WIN?

None offered any solution but gave the
following answers:

A. Cutting: “I am against returning
to the ‘‘on the breath interpretation
. .. aman (should) be convicted for be-
ing visibly under the influence of al-
coholic liquors on the campus.”
Kuykendall: “I am not in favor of re-
laxing the drinking rule (nor) the under
the influence definition. Reactionary
movements .. . are not the answer. I
would prefer to see further work in the
way of definition and mode of enforce-
ment.”

Gilbert: “The drinking rule is a
faculty rule enforced by the Student
Council. The rule at the present is con-
sidered in the eyes of the faculty as
sufficiently liberal... My proposal is
to clarify the rule and to apply it to
the best interests of the student body.”

DRINKING ON CAMPUS

Q. What is your firm conviction on
drinking on campus?

A. Cutting: ‘I favor an alcohol free
campus.” Kuykendall: “I am opposed to
drinking on campus.” Gilbert: ° I don't
feel that drinking on campus is what
the Davidson student prefers.”

office of Student Body President?—ac-

Dr. Drake Publishes
Sociological Work

Dr. Joseph T. Drake, Profes-
sor of Sociology has written a
book “The Aged In American So-
ciety” which goes on sale in
bookstores this week.

The 445 page volume contain-
ing 14 tables presents a .need-
ed synthesis of pioneer. work on
all the pertinent aspects of old

tifically selected and objectively
interpreted by Dr. Drake so as

He discusses the problem. of
the older worker and job seek-
er in our society, the economic
and financial position of the re-
tired person and his dependents,
and the efforts of society to help
older persons to continue as
functioning human beings.

tive leader or co-ordinator? (His most
important function?)

A. Gilbert: “An effective leader and
co-ordinator.” Cutting: ‘Most import-
ant function is to be a co-ordinator.”
Kuykendall: “Two major factors: a co-
ordinator, a mixture of his own per-
sonal principles added to the needs and
the desires of the student body he
serves."

Q. Evaluate this year’s Council.

A. Cutting: “I think the Council
has been a good council, composed of
capable and conscientious men; but I
feel that we have failed to offer effec-
tive leadership at certain times.”

Kuykendall: “Good, good leadership,
met needs partially, passive at times,
too few persons participated or showed
interest.”

Gilbert: “I would say that. this has
been an excellent year for the Coun-
cil. Realizing, of course, that the drink-
ing problem is yet to be solved, new
ideas of the nature of the proposed
Honor Council have materialized which

are corner stones for the future.”

The Council instructed Presi-
