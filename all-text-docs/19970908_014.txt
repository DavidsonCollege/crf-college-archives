The Clemson
women’s soccer team .
hit Richardson. Field
like atornado Wednes-
day night. By the time
the dust had settled, the
score was 7-0 — at
halftime.

’ The Tigers,
ranked eighth in the
country, were simply
faster and better than
the Wildcats. They
dominated the first
half, but scored only
one goal in the second
to make the final 8-0.

“That’s the best
they’ve played in any
game or practice,”
coach Kevin Hundley
said of Clemson’s per-
formance. “They’re a
legitimate top 10 team
and we faced them |
when they were on. That’s a daunt-
ing task for us.”

The
Wild-
cats’ best
chance
came at
the start of the second half when
Kelly Rennick headed a Rhina Rob-
erts corner kick just left of the goal.
Other than that, the shots were few
and far between.

Even so, the Wildcats are look-
ing on the bright side.

“If there is a silver lining in it,
it’s that we played hard and didn’t
give up. We played right through,”
Hundley said. “This will pay divi-
dends somewhere down the line.
There will be another game where
we’ ll draw from this experience and
it will serve us well.”

Hundley was also able to play
all three goalkeepers in the second
half. ;

“I’m pleased we got a chance
to play (backup goalkeeper) Chesley
(Garrett),” the coach explained.
“We need her to get experience
because she has a future in this

program, but it’s difficult to give
her significant minutes with Allie
(Noznesky) being such a signifi-
cant part of the team.”

Noznesky, last year’s confer-
ence player of the year, couldn’t
stop Clemson’ blitzkrieg attack that
fired bullet after bullet with pin-
point accuracy.

“They’re very talented up
front,” Hundley said of the Tigers’
offense. “And they have the best
midfield pair in the country.”

The Wildcats will look to re-
bound from their second loss of the
season when they visit Campbell
Tuesday.

They are still without the ser-
vices of senior tri-captain and stop-
per Kelly Schmidt, who severely
sprained her left ankle in the South
Carolina game. Leila Wormuth is
still out indefinitely with an MCL
injury.

Schmidt will be on crutches for
10 days and her status is week to
week.

“We don’t know if and when
she’ ll be back,” Hundley said. “It’s
up to her and her body.”

The men’s and women’s cross
country teams competed in their
first full meet Saturday at Appala-
chian St.

For the men, Appalachian
proved to be too much, claiming
six of the top ten spots. This left the
remaining three teams — UNC
Asheville, Wake Forest-B, and
Davidson — competing for a sec-
ond-place finish.

The injury-plagued Wildcats
finished fourth. Tripp Ferrell led
Davidson with a time of 27:13, and
William Isenhour followed only
three seconds behind. The two
finished 14th and 15th of the 28
runners. —

Neil Burt grabbed the No. 3
spot in his first collegiate meet,
finishing in 27:21.

Victor Tailbird, who suffered
a stroke last spring, returned to the
team after a summer of rebuilding
his stamina and a solid pre-season.

He finished sixth among the

Senior captains Josh Cookson
and Tripp Franklin were both side-
lined with injuries.

The women’s meet saw results
similar to the men’s. Wake Forest
and Navy were battled for the first
spot, combining to claim nine of the
top 10 spots.

UNC Asheville pulled away
from the pack to claim third, and
Appalachian and Tennessee nar-
rowly defeated the Wildcats. Suzy
Burr finished first for the squad,
and 16th overall out of a field of 27
runners with a time of 19:27.

Allie Curran finished second
for the Wildcats.

A bright spot for Davidson was
the performance of rookies Jill
Neumayer and Smyth Bitter.

They came in third and fourth
with times of 20:04 and 20:44, re-
spectively. Co-captain Kelly Kiefer
claimed the fifth spot with a time of
20:56.

Even when Ukrop has been a playing,” Ukrop explained, refer-

stores and grills his family owns in
the greater Richmond area.

“Everything I have right now

is because of that year.”

Folks in Davidson remember
him as a soccer player — the best
this college has ever seen: And
rightfully so.

But for thousands of school-
children here in Virginia, Rob Ukrop
is simply known as a role model.

Now a star for the Richmond
Kickers of the USISL (United Sys-
tems of Interregional Soccer
Leagues, the sport’s equivalent of
triple-A baseball), he gives inspira-
tional speeches at area schools, us-
ing the 1992 Wildcats as rock-solid
proof that dreams and dedication
are a powerful — and effective —
combination.
~ Because of his on-the-field star-

dom and off-the-field name- and
facerecognition — he has an ad
campaign with the local Arby’s res-
taurants — Ukrop has gained a cer-
tain celebrity. status here in
Virginia’s capital.

So when he speaks, kids listen.

And the message he sends is the

same one with which he led the
1992 Wildcats: Success is the direct
result of hard work.

“Dream high. Work harder,”
as he often says.

He also borrows a Thomas
Jefferson maxim: “I’m a firm be-
liever in luck. The harder I work,
the more I have of it.”

“The message he sends to the
kids is great,” said Alex Deegan,
who plays goal for the Kickers and
currently lives with Ukrop. “He
can make a difference in their lives,
which is-really nice to see. You
don’t see too much of that in this

- day and age.”

“Rob has never had a drop of

alcohol in his life, never had a ciga-
rette, never even had a cup of cof-
fee,” Spear said. “He has some very
important values, and it’s good he
can spread those values to kids —
that you can be a winner without
those things.”

“The best thing for me right
now is talking to the kids,” said
Ukrop, who credits Bonnie
McAlister’s speech class with giv-
ing him the confidence and ability
to speak effectively in public.

“There are so many problems
out there. And my goal is to wake
up-every day and try to make some-
body smile. Hopefully, I can im-
pact and touch somebody’s life ev-
ery day.”

“That’s the best thing we did in
my four years (on the soccer team at
Davidson) — we made people smile.
And that’s what drives me. Youcan
touch peoples’ lives whether you
know it or not.”
