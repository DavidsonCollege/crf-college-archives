THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO FRIDAY, APRIL 8, Toso

(AIL Unsigned Editorials oy, the Editor)

A First Class Revamping

The changes in the ROTC curricu-
lum dre, we think, major stéps for-
ward for the department. They meet
criticisms levelled at ROTC depart-
ments throughout the country, and
with the new curriculum the depart-
ment will contribute substantially
more to the process of offering liberal
education at Davidson.

The biggest fault found with the
traditional course is whether or not
such a course belongs in an educa-
tional institution. Learning how to
kill the enemy is scarcely liberal arts,
and even less in keeping with the
ideals of a church-related college.

There is no major change in the
basic course to answer these ques-
tions, but there has been change of
emphasis to make room for the real
meat to come in the advanced course.
Tactics will appear for the first time
in the sophomore year, and weapons
instruction will be cut drastically.
Where will it be taught? In a re-
vamped summer camp program.

Advanced students are still the only

Lacking: Student

ones required to attend the camp,
and the basic philosophy is that basic
cadets don’t get enough practical
weapons instructions to be of real
value anyway. Drill has been cut to
one hour.

An advanced cadet can choose a
course from the fields of effective
communication, science comprehen-
sion, general psychology or political
development and institutions, and ap-
ply one semester each year of one
of these courses to his ROTC require-
ments. This means that he goes to
class and drill in the ROTC depart-
ment for only one semester, but he
is credited and paid for the other
as well. Since only half of the ad-
vanced cadets will be taking drill
each semester, the useless -positions
will be cut out and each man will
have a responsible job to do.

Colonel Adams says he has been
working on this change for a year,
and we congratulate him for what
appears to be a first-class revamp-
ing.

Interest

And Performance Appeal

The Artist Series programs run
from hot to cold, depending on the
night they are offered. the time of
year, and of course the performer. The
interview with Mr. Shaw Smith (See
page one) points up what we have
felt for a long time — that the Series,
potentially a tremendous attraction,
has to take second place to other cam-
pus activities.

There are two basic reasons for the
failure. The first is lack of interest on
the part of the students. because they
feel that the programs presented just
aren't interesting or worth the time
to go to them. Mr. Smith postulates
that the purpose of the Series is not
“to provide popular entertainment.”
but to offer “what most students
wouldn’t get for themselves.” Perhaps
‘an objective examination:of this pos-
tulate would bring improvement.:

True, the Series provides what most
students wouldn't get for themselves,

but do the students take advantage of
this offering? If the purpose of the

. Series is to interest students in dis-

tant fields, we think that the first
step, before offering the distant fields,
is to interest the students.

Which brings us to the second big
problem. The Committee is forced to
scrimp along on a too-meagre budget,
and the performers it can get on this
budget do not have the appeal neces-
sary for student interest. Mr. Smith
says that ‘We simply cannot afford
big names when we are staging seven
attractions a year on such a budget.”
The ideal solution is, of course, a
larger budget. But this lacking, would
it not be more practical to stage, say,
four attractions with the present bud-
get?

It seems to us that a lot of student
interest some of the time is better
than no interest all of the time.

The Verdict Is Yours

Traditionally, a major part of an
outgoing editor's final comments is
devoted to a summary of editorial
policy for the year. It is: the “one
last Shot" of the editor.

We shall depart from tradition this
year. We see no need to rehash old
arguments or to refresh student mem-
ory of editorial stands. We think the
students are well aware of how we
stand on major issues, and for this
Treason we see no need of filling up
this column with warmed-over issues
and arguments.

We would like to say, however,
that we think it’s been a good semes-
ter; the editoral staff has been a

free one in the largest sense of the
word. Controversy has _ inevitably
arisen, but we think that only through
controversy and discussion can pro-
gress be made.

As we turn from” writer to avid
reader, a remark from one of the
personal letters we have received
comes ‘to mind: The greatest service
a college newspaper can perform is

to stimulate honest discussion and-

objective examination, regardless of
whether or not editorial -stands- hap-
pen to agree with student opinion.

We leave the final verdict and pro-
nouncement to DAVIDSONIAN read-

ers.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Writers Hit Paper’s Athletic Proposals

Dave McCullough

Dear Editor:

This is a biased, prejudiced
letter written by a scholarship
athlete in defense of ,preseving
football scholarships.

i wish to take issue with
several parts of the lafest edi-
torial of “The Great Crusade”
sories by our crusading editor
who would seemingly like to
see Davidson as it is at
present turned upside down.

Concerning the statement “an
easy way to judge the relative
amount of interest in the rela-
tionship of athletics to academic
‘is to look at amounts of money
spent on each using the Endow-
ment Fund as a reference,” per-
haps it has not occurred to the
editor that some of the alumni
contribute money to the Living
Endowment Fund for athletic
scholarships only — would the
Living Endowment Fund be
nearly as large without this
money?

Also the new Dana scholar-
ships will provide many men
with sid who previously had
none.

I think the alumni and Board
of Trustees should be able to
control athletic policy as they
sce fit, implementing the appa-
rent wishes of the majority of

Hatties Way Out? . . ..

a! alumni as long as admission
stundards are not lowered.

It seems that since neither
the editor nor are yet grad-
vates, how can wo grasp the
whole picture of the relative
importance -of athletics as
well as the almuni can?

We should accept their -deci-
sions as more prudent and bet-
ter for the general welfare than
ours might be.

In my opinion the scholarship
athletes have contributed pro-
portionately as much to the
school in all phases as have the
academic winners.

The football scholarship
athletes exert a leveling in-
fluence on the school by
drawing «a healthy medium
between ultra-intellectualism
and shoddy work, and also by
participating in many extra-
curricular activities.

The whole matter boils down
to this—do we want to secure
the all-around student at David-
son, or do we want to lay prac-
tically all emphasis on_intel-
lectual prowess?

Football players bring in some
revenue via gates receipts. Do
the academic scholarship stu-
dents? Football players also
have to work a lot harder for
the compensation they receive.

Laying aside the mercenary

PRESIDENT’S EVALUATION:

fA

aspect, the participation of
Davidson in the Southern
Conference gives it a certain
prestige and appeal which
aid the school in publicity.

A 5.4 record (which Davidson
had for four straight years be-
fore 1959) gives favorable pub-
licity to the school and gives

many students a certain amount.

of pride in their school.

I feel that our present foot-
ball set-up is a valuable fall
meeting grounds for social uni-
fication of the students which
they “need very much. Other
meeting grounds are Hattie’s
and concerts in Chambers.

The intellectual side of
Davidson is stressed enough
now. if we cut out scholar-
ship football we will lose a
valuable outlet for excess stu-
dent energy and will probably
become tike W. & L. | don’t
think the average Davidson
student wants this.

This excess (which cannot be
burned up by studying) would go
to a certain extent to week-end
drunken blasts at State, Duke,
and Carolina.

1 would rather say to a W. &
L. man, “we may not be able
to outdrink you, but we can
beat hell out of you in football.”

Let’s keep Davidson a won-
derland and not let it turn into
fairyland.

McKeithen Reviews IFC Year:
“We've Moved In New Areas’’

By WARD McKEITHEN

The Inaterfraternity Council
has found itself during the past
year faced with several oppor-
tunities for active leadership
and work. . .

The Council is an organiza-
tion established to govern: the
interfraternity relations and as
such ts blessed with specific

functions and student support.

(DEA ESTABLISHED

Among the other major func-
tions of the IFC are the co-
ordination of Rush Week and
Greek Week. Rush Week ‘was
carried out with a noticable lack
of confusion ‘and complaint.

The: Greek Week constituted
a major effort on the part of
the fraternities and the IFC.

The pledge banquet and tro-

has the opportunity of effective-
ly acting in behalf of a large
majority of students. As a re-
sult of the support and interest
given it, the Council has re-
ceived a strong influence and
potential. It is this potential,
along with the specific fune-
tions, that the Council must
fulfill next year.

Thus the Council:: will be

CARD HIGH
PROUDLY INTO

Scot Lacy

Dear Sir:

In the beginning let me say
that no one has more respect
for scholastic achievernent than
T do.

Nevertheless, | feel that the
recent controversy over ath-
letic versus academic scholar-
ships has been presented
from a one-sided and slanted
point of view; therefore !
would like to clear the air
somewhet and get a few of
the arguments out into the
open.

In the first place I am not
sure I understand what the edi-
tor meant in his recent editorial
when he seemed to advocate a
reduction in the athletic schol-
arship fund solely because the
football team had not managed
to “compete successfully” in
the Southern Conference—last
year.

Is the won-lost record the
main consideration?

Besides, whether Oavidson
awards 12 basketball scholar-
ships or 49 football scholar-
ships we still have the seme
“immoral” question confront.
ing us of whether it is eight
to have subsidized athletics in

an institution dedicated to
higher learning.

If then it is really the ques.
tion of the rightness or wrong-
ness of athletic scholarships,
why don’t the opponents argue
from this ground alone instead
of retreating behind the pro-
tection provided by a compari-
son of the two funds.

Certainly it docsn’t seem
right that there should be
$60,000 in the athletic fund
available for approximately
60 boys end only $88,000 for
the 220 boys receiving the
varlous grants-in-aid and eca-
demic scholerships.

But, as I see it, it isn’t that
the athletic fund is too large
but rather that the academic
fund is too small.

tt might be thet e quick
look at the amounts of money
provided for academic schol-
arships by the other schools
of comparative sizo and repu-
tation would prove enlighten-
ing.

In closing I would just like to
say that it seems funny that
there should be such an in-
crease in the criticism leveled
at our athletic policy during the
one year that the two subsidized
sports have had such unfortun-
ate seasons.

Of Voting Amendment

Dear Editor:

Dee Green Tuesday in presenting to the student
body a constitutional amendment did so in such a way:
as to violate the rights of at least a hundred students.

Having taken the ballots to all the fraternity

houses, he failed to distri

bute them to the indepen-

dents, either at Mrs. Copeland’s or the.Union.
This action by the President of the Student Body,

who was elected to preserve

the rights of all the students,

is intolerable under a democratic system.

It also shows Green’s complete lack of concern
for proper democratic procedure. If such action is

tolerated by the student

body democratic rule will

become a mockery, for if any group is arbitrarily
disenfranchised by a person concerned only with creat-
ing an image of a hard-working student counell, no

one is guaranteed that he

will not be next to lose his

The student body must rise in protest to protect
its rights. It must call on the student council to declare
the vote null and void and to rerun the vote.

The President of the Student Body must learn that
he will have to operate under at least a semblance of
demecratic procedure, even if it is in the last few

weeks of his term.

The action by the Student Body must be taken
now and not later, This issue must not die, as have so
many others, without action.
