Recruitment of blacks has no
been as successful Bevan said
that there are primarily two
reasons why no blacks have
been hired

First. Davidson is @ Southern
rural institution Most black
prospects have attended
graduate schools in the Mid-
west. Northeast and Califorma
and after graduating want to
stay in those regions

“There is also a strong
movement among blacks to
teach in black institutions and
make them stronger It is spirt
of identity with the black
cause, Bevan explained

Bevan emphasized that the
college was making a concerted
effort to hire minority group
professors

“T think that it is in line with
the college's purpose to hire

professors. A more diversified

Senate Approves Night Exams
Grading Policy Faces Revision

By BRUCE CORSER
Manegimg Editer

A resolution by Blain Butner
concermng night examination
penods was unanimously en-
dorsed by the student Senate
this week

The resolution proposes that
evening €xam sessions be in-
stituted on a tna! basis during
the first two devs of the exam
period from 7 to 10pm for the
fell of 1973

The institution of such exam
sessions would be an expansion
of the present systern However
night €xams would operate by
tné same guidelines under

lavtume exams are now

administered

sne rationale supportin
ught exams is that they w
allow students greater
flexibility of scheduling to fit
various study habits

Specifically this would
provide the students with the
option of taking two exams in
one day not in succession and
thereby completing exams at
an earlier date

The resolution also charges
the Senate with the respon-
sibility of recruiting students to
aid in the additiona) workload
that the night exam period
would coment —_

This proposal wi presen-
ted toe the members of the

first involves lengthening the presented to the EPC for cen-

“drop” part of the ‘‘drop-add”’
period from one-tenth of a term
to one-half of a term (from one
week to five weeks).

The second proposal calls for
deleting a failing grade from
the grade point average once
the failed course has been
repeated and to include within
the grade point average only
the repeated course grade. The
failing grade would remain on
the transcript, however.

The resolution was passed
unanimously and will be

Sideration.

dc motion by Vince Rabil en-
rsing a proposal by Alec Hoon

which calls for the subsidization

of the editor of THE DAVID-

SONIAN by $300 annually was

passed by an 11 to five majority

This endorsement will now go
before the Campus Tax Council
for deliberation.

The Senate also chartered
two groups in its last meeting.
The “Sunday Night Group™’ and
the ‘Great Concept Club" were
both given official approval.
