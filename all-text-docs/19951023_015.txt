A sadder
side of
sports

By Matr Pitzer
Sports Editor

Sports are based on dreams.
Dreams of winning champion-
ships, dreams of breaking records
‘and dreams of reaching for and
attaining that almighty high of win-
ning.

According to

Schoon

And although most athletes
ultimately fail in one sense when
they don’t win championships,
sports are uplifting and energizing
because we can watch these people
in the pursuit of their ultimate
dream.

Travis Roy, however, will
never have that chance. The Bos-
ton University hockey player will
never have an opportunity to take a
perfect pass from a teammate, slap
it past the opposing goalie and
dance and celebrate like there’s no
tomorrow.

Friday night, just // seconds
into the first game of a college
hockey career that was supposed
to be filled with wonder, amaze-
ment and joy, Roy missed a check
on an opponent, slammed into the
boards awkwardly and crumpled
to the ice — likely the last signifi-
cant movement of his life.

In that split-second, when all
that can go wrong does, Roy shat-
tered a vertebra in his neck and
injured his spinal cord. Over the
weekend, he was in serious but
stable condition in a Boston hospi-
tal, paralyzed from the neck down
and given little, if any, chance to
recover.

Stuff like this isn’t supposed
to happen in sports. Sure, athletes
get hurt. Anyone who has ever
played any game has probably felt
some pain in a knee or some other
joint. Athletes do get injured.

But they recover. They come
back to play another day, to take
another shot at the ultimate dream.

The Travis Roys of the world
have lost that chance forever. The
football players whoare hit slightly
the wrong way, the boxers who are
pummeled for one round too long
and all the athletes who attempt
one too many comebacks on a bum
knee have all lost their chances at
glory forever.

So while we like to think the
worst thing in the sports arena is
our team losing in the final sec-
onds, accidents such as Roy’s force

us to realize, however painfully, °

that there are indeed more impor-
tant things.

Even when we consider the
biggest chokes in sports, some-
body else wins. Despite the fact
that a ground ball rolls between a
player’s legs tolose a game, we are
forced to remember thatsomebody
else still won.

But who won when Travis Roy
crashed into the boards?

Hockey player, Erin Smith.

hitting stride
after slow start

Wildcats gain confidence
after win over Louisville

The field hockey team is con-
tinuing its excellent play after a

‘slow start to the season,

Putting injuries and marginal
play behind them, the team has
gained confidence in its ability to
win.

FIELD HOCKEY

“The moral of the team is re-

-ally up from earlier in the season,”

coach Betsy Pryor said.

The new-look Wildcats had
two games scheduled for last week,
but because of flooding conditions,
Sunday’s game against William &
Mary was canceled.

Unfortunately for Louisville,
however, the field was ready on
Monday and the Wildcats took a 4-
0 win. That game started slowly
for Davidson, but it did not take
long for the team to start execut-
ing. :
Meredith Rachinsky began the
scoring by assisting Holly Kledis,
who scored the first three goals for
the Wildcats. The last goal was
scored by Heather McAlpine off
an assist from Nicole Ficeto on a
direct corner.

Of course, as it turned out, the
first goal was enough, because the

defense kept Louisville from
mounting challenge.

“The defense kept plugging it
up and did not allow Louisville
many scoring opportunities,” Pryor
said. The Wildcats outshot Louis-
ville 38-8 and allowed only two
shots on goal in the second half.

The Wildcats host Indiana
(Pa.) next Sunday in their last match
before hosting the conference tour-
nament next weekend.

Volleyball 2

By Jason McMULLAN

Halfway through its confer-
ence season, Davidson is well on
its way to satisfying its major goal:
finishing fourth or fifth in the
Southern Conference.

VOLLEYBALL

The Wildcats are currently sit-
ting fifth in the league, ahead of
last year’s seventh-place finish.

“I feel really good about our
progress this season,” coach Lisa
Radford said. “The name of the
game is learning, and we have
learned from every experience.
This is a young group that will just
get better.”

Michele Augustin is tops in
the conference in digs per game,
and is showing no signs of slowing
down. L. A. Bumgarner is “com-
ing alive,” Radford said; the sopho-
more is third in the conference in
aces, fourth in hitting percentage
and leads the team in those catego-
ries and kills. Cindy Seegers leads
the team in assists per game.

“This year is a really good
year for Davidson volleyball,”

improves

Radford said. Belk Arena will host
the Southern Conference tourna-
ment Nov. 17-19. This year’s tour-
nament will help mark the 75th
anniversary of the Southern Con- °
ference as well as the 100th anni-
versary of volleyball. “Our goal,”
Radford said, “‘is to fill all of the
red seats in the arena for the prime-
time games,” or about 1000 seats.

The tournamentis not the only
thing Radford hopes will spark
more interest in the sport. Plans
are underway for a developmental
youth league in December and
January, as well as clinics for el-
ementary school students. Those
events will complement the
Davidson summer camps.

This weekend offers some
good chances to see the improved
Wildcats. Friday, Davidson hosts
Furman, second in the conference,
at 7 p.m. After a day of rest,
Georgia Southern comes to Belk
Arena for a 2 p.m. game.

“This is a pivotal match for
us,” Radford said. “It will prob-
ably mean the difference between
fourth and fifth place in the confer-
ence for us.”

“Fan support is crucial right
now,” Radford added. She hopes
that number will soon increase from

that average of 120 pinkie fans
per match.

may have had more shots, but we
kept them from getting good shots.
We made some unbelievable plays
and had some great opportunities,
but their defensive backs were re-
ally fast. Today was a moral vic-
tory for us.”

Plosser echoed many of the
same feelings, saying, “Their backs
were the best defenders we have
seen all year.

The second half we really
stepped up, and you could see the
improvements we have made in
recent weeks. We created many
scoring opportunities against a
nationally-ranked team, and I feel
really good about today.”
