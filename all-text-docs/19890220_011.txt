Some...

some (did I ever leave with you) thing

in weary dusk'unseeing eyewide |

gaze up through need --i too seek

your warm sleeping form

mere glow cast by city’s greyness

i breathe you (in) your scent secure

touching through bare moments of softly us
only searching some attempted refugees

ran common ground from chaos

oh, you’d ask but what i barely held

some strength of desperate me you’d guessed
listen, we’d be i said and meant

but our little time to rest -- now

some (i did ever love with you) thing
missing -- : _Fas

—Peter Tavernise, ’90

And dread:

i hose doe eyes darted

Sram train Aarke tr taba AlARL
f rom train decks to ticket 4 1OcKS
insectoid mouth aflutter,

“Don’t worry,”

With a dumb show shoulder shirk

., Pulling brown brows up

receaen ON puppet twine

You assumed a dough hue

Pasted thick and vague

As an ink blurr -- .

Muffled as murmurs into death tubes.

You twist to the southbound’s scream
As light in needles like iron burned.
That smile silhouetted

- ‘Weighted like a baby

With sandbullets slung from the neck
: I bend to gather the pieces.
