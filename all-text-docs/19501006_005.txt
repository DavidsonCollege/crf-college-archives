Frosh. Plunge Into 5-Game Slate

Against Bullpups

the freshman football squad at

the end of three and a half weeks of praetice. With their first
game only a week aff. these thirty-five grid hopefuls have|hanrered abom in dorm pull so
been working long and hard, scrimmaging the varsity four days
a week in an effort to perfect a somewhat ragged offense.

a Welch, West Virginia hoy, and
Hershel Allen from Monticello, Ga.
These boys have been splitting the
job of running the split-T forma-
tion installed by varsity coach Crow-
ell Little. The brightest spot in the
frosh backfield, during recent scrim-
mages, has been halfback Jobuiy
Gray fram Statesville. Gray. a
small (150) pounds) but flashy
speedster, has gotten off some nice
runs against the varsity, and will
most. likely be a starter when the
team opens their season here next
Saturday against the Citadel frash.

Coach Baird praised the defen-
sive play of his clib, which showed

up best in a full-dress scrimmage| Qe1,

against the varsity two weeks ago.
However, the squad is woefully
short of tackles and guards and
there are only two centers on the
active list. At the ends, too, mater-
ial is short with only five flankers
seeing service.

Injuries have ‘taken. their toll over
the first few weeks of practice, and
at present five boys are out of act-
ion ‘on this account. On the first
lay of practice Hacry Yarborough;
a Wilson husky... aygravated an oll
knee injury and will aot be able
to play until he has had an opera
tion, Bill Eliott, a center from
Lincolnton, suffered a broken cok
lar-bone. several days ago and may
not see action this season, Bill Me-
Allister, an end, and Malphus Brad-
bury and Carroll Gray, guards, are
out with nrinor hurts. -

Bradbury, incidentally has been
the ‘standout in the frosh line in
recent scrimmages. From his po-
sitien at guard lie has thrown some
vicious blocks arid has also laoked
good on downficld blocking. Tack-
les Bilt Putnam and Phit McGill,
have been the defensive stars. Me-
Gill, a Darlington prep school: grad-
uate, whose home is only a few
blocks off the campus, is a short.

charge, and should give opposinz

Coach Baird. who has been a-
sisted im the coaching dutie~ by
Kirk Oulesby and former Wildcat
star Jake Wade, does not plan to
name a-regular starting cleven until
after the opening contest with the
citadel. The frosh mentor plans to
use mpst of bis sqirad in this game
in unm effort to fest. his material
uncer fire. However, Baird expect:
to field a regular line averaging: at
least 180. pounds. while the hack-
field should average only stigitly
less af 175.
