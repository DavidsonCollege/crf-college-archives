Cellist dazzles Davidson

By Jim Moss

On Tuesday, September 21,
Alan Black performed four pieces
on the cello in Hodson Hall. The
principal cellist for the Charlotte
Symphony Orchestra, Black stud-
ied at UCLA and Indiana before
becoming a professional performer
and teacher. Some of his most
notable achievements include play-
ing with Bobby McFerrin and win-
ning an Emerging Artists Grant
from the Mecklenburg County Arts
and Science Council. He is also a
prominent player at festivals na-
tionwide.

Hodson Hall was about three-
quarters full for the recital. The
program included pieces from four
different musical periods. After
displaying his highly developed
abilities on Bach’s Suite #2 in D
Minor for Solo Cello and
Beethoven’s Sonata for Cello and
Piano in A Major (accompanied
by Jean Roberts), Black delved
into the soul and into the possibili-
ties of the cello in the second half
of the program.

Abschied for Cello and Piano,
composed by Mark Carlson, is a

very powerful 20th-century piece.
Almost playing a more expressive
version of a funeral dirge, Black
successfully related the deep pain
of losing loved ones that inspired
the composer. The final selection,
played with Sungil Lee, most fully
displayed Black’s cello talents.
Ravel’s Sonata for Violin and Cello
is a good example of the composi-
tional attitude that existed at the
turn of the century, as the piece
tries to break free from the har-
monic and melodic constraints of
romanticism.

Black and Lee, whois the Con-
certmaster of the Charlotte Sym-
phony Orchestra, worked together
to produce surprisingly powerful
two-part harmonies while also ex-
pressing their melodic statements
independently. I could almost see
Ravel thumbing his nose at some
of the old rules. Some traditional
techniques, such as plucking and
bowing, were used expertly and
inventively. The performance of
both musicians was very impres-
sive.

The only mishap of the recital
was when Black broke a string on

his cello during the final move-
ment of the final piece. The bro-
ken string, however, did not seem
to phase him. He quickly replaced
it and finished the piece with no
less passion. -

Afterward, Black commented
that he was very pleased with how
the recital turned out. Hopefully,
he will return to Davidson again in
the future to display his appre-
ciable talent.

Senior's perspective altered after spending
spring in Western Samoa

By Renu Bhatt

Last semester was a unique
period of self-discovery for
Davidson senior David Williard.
After spending time sweating out
his “radical culture shock” (liter-
ally) in tropical Western Samoa,
he says, “I feel like I’ve really
grown up fast in the last nine
months. I learned more in Western
Samoa than I did in two and a half
years at Davidson.”

Sponsored by the School for
International Training, Williard
spent the spring semester studying
the Samoan language and culture.
After spending a week in Hono-
lulu to adjust, Williard and his
group of nine other students set out
to conquer the equatorial heat and
post-monsoon rains. (The islands
have an annual rain fall of about
250 inches.) For the first month,
Williard admits to having suffered
a great deal of culture shock, espe-
cially since he had never been out
of the United States before. He
took classes for two and a half
months before he started his inde-
pendent study. His topic was en-
titled “The Effects of Westerniza-
tion in Western Samoa.”

Through his research, Williard
has concluded that the current Sa-
moan culture is changing fast. In
Western Samoa, they have a com-
munal system called “matai.” The
tiny island of Upolu consists of
about 300 villages which, up until

moder times, have always worked
together to achieve common goals.
The people would work harmoni-
ously together for the good of the
nation, but Williard fears that West-
_érn_ Samoan. society. is becoming
more focused on material gain and
its economy. The government of
the islands is a lenient parliamen-
tary system which leaves a lot of
space for public opinion and al-
lows for society to have much say
about its function. * An English

major here at Davidson, Williard

" spoke to Samoan poets who write

in English. He used their works
and expanded upon them for the
basis of his research.

Tourism and other interna-
tional influences are what are push-
ing the westernization of this very
“fragile culture that can be easily
taken” from the “cradle of
Polynesia.” When Western Sa-
moa first gained its independence
from New Zealand in the mid

1970’s, tourism was widely dis-
couraged. Now, however, it is a
popular industry that is allowing
the country and its culture to be
“taken over by western ideas.”
Williard says that there is a big
dichotomy between the city and
village life of the Samoan islands.
Once one leaves the three mile
radius of a city, there are only
villages to be seen as far as one’s
eyes can wander. Until about two

Movie Review
Don't waste
your Milk
Money on it

By Tammy Tiska
I had already seen almost
everything showing at Movies
at the Lake. Almost everything.
So I resigned myself to go see
Milk Money. Actually, I was
kind of looking forward to it. I

atleast. But have never been so
embarrassed to watch a movie.
Iteven rivaled my shame at hav-
ing seen Luke Perry in Eight
Seconds last spring.

The fact that most of the
people who saw me had sat
through the same movie was little
consolation. I ran for the park-
ing lot.

Milk Money is an unfortu-
nate melange of Pretty Woman
and Sleepless in Seattle. Moth-
erless since birth, Frank and his
pre-adolescent friends decide
they are going to get a real les-
son in the mysteries of the fe-

| male anatomy and bike to the

big city so they can pay a prosti-
tute to take her clothes off. The
plot gets increasingly believable.
Vee (Melanie Griffith) befriends
the wayward boys, gives them
their money’s worth and a ride
home, has car trouble, and is
stranded in a suburban utopia to
fall in love with Frank’s marsh-
loving father (Ed Harris).
Melanie tries, but it takes
about two seconds to begin wish-
ing that she would drop the
whiny whisper and speak up.
Then there isthe incredibly witty
exchange where Frank’s Dad
