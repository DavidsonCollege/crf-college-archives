Some Hollanders Find
‘Dutch’ A Derisive Term

Goodykoontz Tyson and characteristics of their homelands, or on their impressions of Davidson.

Some Hollanders are ashamed of the name Dutch. Why should they? Because it
is used, they say, in so many derisive and derogatory phrases that give the nation a bad
name. But is a nation’s worth not appraised by its own actions, not by a forejgner’s
abuse?

Besides, most of these idioms

have ceased to be current,
Dutch concert, Dutch defense,
Dutch widow (and do not forget
a Dutch date) have passed from
speakers’ lips to the page of
the dictionary. We do not like
to be called Dutchmen, these
j Hollanders tell their American
friends, because your English
ancestors poked fun at Dutch-
men and anything Dutch.

The whole country, and the
outside world as well, adopted
it at a period when, if .it had
not been for Holland, the
Dutch Republic could not
have survived. That the Neth-
erlands existed at all as an
independent nation is chiefly
owing to Holland’s leadership
in the crucial days of the
Dutch fight for freedom.

Dutchmen and foreigners ex-
pressed their recognition of that

mame by which Americans
can call us, and Dutch is the
one that is easiest to use.
most Dutchmen.

The Dutch themselves call
their country Holland, The
Netherlands is used only when
they write. There are Dutchmen,
indeed, who resent the use of
Holland as the name o fthe en-

Radio Club Participates
In Relay League Contest

By LEONARD RICHARDSON
Davidsonian Feature Editor

Three weeks ago students who room on the first floor of Belk turned on their
radios and heard “ham” call-letters instead of music. More of the same is in store next

weekend.

A week from tonight at 7
p.m. licensed Radio Club mem-
bers will begin the second and
fina, rart of toe Toternational
American Radio Relay League
DX Contest. .

These radio amateurs are
competing against other licensed
amateurs in the 50 states and
Canada in an attempt to con-
tact stations in as many foreign
countries as possible.

36 HOUR VIGIL

The first uninterrupted 36.
hour vigil in the southwest
corner of Belk basement was
held three weeks ago. The sec-
ond part of the contest takes
place next weekend. from 7
p.m. March 3 through 7 p.m.
March 5.

Final results of the contest
will be published in the August
issue of “QST” — the official
publication of the American
Radio League which is sponsor-
ing the contest.

“We made 127 contacts on
four bands -~ 34 countries in
36 hours — during the first part
of the contest,” said Peery
Grant, president of the club.

Rhodes Scholar
To View Education

Hugh Cannon, Davidson’s
tenth Rhodes Csholar, will speak
in assembly Feb. 28, comparing
Davidson's approach to educa-
tion with those of Oxford and
Harvard.

Cannon, who visited the
campus last year while cam-
paigning for Governor Terry
Sanford, now holds the post of
assistant to the governor.

A coffee hour after the pro-
gram will give members of the
student: body a chance to talk
with him.

Entering Davidson in 1949
Cannon began preparing for a
law career. (He listed politics
as one of his hobbies.) Here he
was elected president of the
YMCA, and earned membership
in Phi Beta Kappa, and Omi-
cron Delta Kappa. He spent the
summer of 1952 doing YMCA
work in France, and received
recognition from the US am-
bassador to France.

Graduating in 1953, Cannon
entered Christ Church College
of Oxford, There he was active
in the Oxford Union Society,
a debating group and was on
the rowing team. Taking his
B.A. from Oxford in 1955, he
entered Harvard Law School.

After graduating from Har-
vard, he entered Sanford’s. law
firm in Fayetteville, North
Carolina. He received his first
government job as a member
of the five-man Institute of
Government, which publishes
the legislation bulletin.

.

The log sheet which records
the traffic during the 36-hour
period three weeks ago lists
countries on all parts of the
globe, “We worked some rare
places," ‘Hewitt ‘Harrill re-
marked. “We contacted the
Cook Islands in the Pacific,
Swaziland in Africa, and most of
the countries in
Europe. South America,
Pan America.”

The Radio Club was formed
here last year by the ROTC
Department after Col. William

under the supervision of Capt.
Donald Threlkeld.

The club is in the Military
Air Radio System which covers
North Carolina and the Third
Army net. In time of emergency,
the club can handle military
traffic. When Western North

Grant said that anyone inter-

to come down to the southwest

Another question concerned
Statements made by Arnold
Toynbee who will speak to Da-
vidson students on March 27
and 28. A young man who re-
ferred to himself as ‘“‘a British
subject” questioned Uris as to
the validity of his statements
concerning British refugee
camps in his book Exedus, and
quoted statements made by
historian Toynbee.

“I'm not going to argue
with Toynbee,” said Uris.
“He's been on this kick for
two decades.”

On Thursday both Uris and
Leshem spoke to various Bible,
psychology and political science
classes and dined at several fra-
ternity houses. Leshem also
showed films of Israel in the
College Union on Thursday
afternoon.
