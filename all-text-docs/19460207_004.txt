Corner...

WELCOME TO DAVIDSON!
To see the Dormitories and _the
Classrooms filled once again is a
happy feeling. Thanks be to God
that you former students have re-
turned; and that you new men have
joined our Davidson family. Our
Alma Mater has crossed the‘ ‘rough”
spots sitccessfully—and now we are
beginning a Era. This is a
time for greatness; a time to con-
tinue building a better Davidson!

GROWTH IN CHRIST is an es-
sential factor in achieving this goal!
In order to encourage and aid you
in this growth in Christ, we have
organized a Student Christian As-
sociation—the YMCA. Every stu:
dent at Davidson is automatically a
member of the “Y.” It is the pur-
pose of the “Y” at Davidson—tirst
of all; to make Christ a reality to
every student; and second: to give
students an opportunity for express-
ing their Christianity through serv’
ing and teaching others. Familiarize

new

yourself. with our “Y" Program,
and find out where you can best
fit’ in.

The “Y” has been very active this
year under the leadership of Bill
McLean—President. Following are
some news items collected from the

various departments of the “Y”
Cabinet:
VESPER SERVICE AND

CHURCH RELATIONS DEPART:
MENT—Ralph (Soapy) Smith is
responsible for this department, the
purpose of which is to provide ush-
ers for the Sunday Evening Vesper
Services. This department also hand
les the collections taken at these
services; and keeps the student body
informed of the use of this money.
At the beginning of the year a Ves"
pers Fund Budget was drawn up—
and the money was distributed be-
tween several benevolent causes.
For instance: The WORLD STU-
DENT SERVICE FUND recently

received $150.00 from our Vesper
Funds. The WSSF is an agency
through which Christian students

can help receive the burdens of suf-
fering students of less fortunate por-
tions of the world, Another $150.00
was sent to “The Heifer For Relief”
Project of the Brethren Church in
Napanee, Indiana—to buy a Heifer
to send to Europe. At Thanksgiving
$100.00 was sent to BARIUM
SPRINGS—where the Presbyterian
Orphans Home is located. These
are a few of the uses that are made
of the money that you contribute
to the collections at Vespers every
Sunday night. If you have any sug-
gestions about worthy causes that
we could help through our Vesper
Funds—please stop in the “Y”
Office and pass them on.

SUNDAY SCHOOL DEPART-
MENT—The Mecklenburg Sanitor-
ium has been gladly receiving a
few boys each Sunday who have
faithfully journeyed there to teach
the weekly Sunday lessons from the
Ernest Workers.” Charles Mills,
Ed Hopper, W. A. Crosland, Bob
Henderson, Mac Hart are a few of
the boys who have been doing a
“good job with our friends. Jack
Bagley has been rewarded for his
successful efforts of handling the
Student Sunday School Class which
meets in the “Y” every Sunday at

10:15. A.M. Attendance has been
large; and the forum-type discus-
sions have been very interesting

and beneficial. Come out next Sun-
day at 10:15. If any of you are in-
terested in teaching Sunday School
classes and are not. doing so—please
see Jack Bagley or stop in at the
“Y" Office and we'll find a place
for you to teach.

BOY'S

WORK—There are two
large fields of activity under this
department: Scout Work in the

community; and work with young
boys—(Gra-Y; Hi-Y work). Harry
McLean is in charge of Scouts; and
Herb Wyatt and Gene Linton are
handling boy's work. Every Satur-
day afternoon Herb and Gene take
a group of thirteen year old boys to
the Charlotte YMCA to play a
basketball tournament. Practice is
held three afternoons a week in the
high-school gym for ‘these boys.
There is another group of boys in
Cornelius with whom we are work-
ing—however, we need some more

student volunteers to carry on.
Bob Wilkins is working with
the Cornelius boys. At present

we_need: two boys ‘to helpcoach
basketball; one or two boys to re-
feree basketball games. You can be
of great service to the “Y” and to
the Community if you will spend one
hour two or three afternoonsa week
to help in our Boy's Work. This is
a voluntary job—but the rewards
are great. “Life goes the way Youth
cd takes”. Help show these boys

the right way to take.
SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT
DEPARTMENT— ‘The purpose of
this department which is under the
Vergon McGehee, is
to promote, personal Christian living
by the average student. This is ac-
complished through the niedium of
