Widespread Panic Takes Their Music to New Levels

By Chip Petree

"Who's that girl on the cover?"

That’s the question I was ask-
ing myself as I left Repo CD’s last
Tuesday with the new release from
Widespread Panic, Everyday, in
my hand. I have been eagerly an-
ticipating this new release from
the Athens-based group, and its
arrival on the storeshelves has fi-
nally ended months of speculation
as to the nature of the release.

Way back on October 5-6 the
band held two concerts in Athens’
Georgia Theatre to supposedly
record live material for a then-
soon-to-be-released album. The
plans changed as the band indi-
cated only some of the live mate-
rial would accompany several stu-
dio tracks. Of course, this was little
recompense for the several hun-
dred of us who attended the The-
atre shows in hopes of hearing
ourselves on the album!

However, Everyday has sur-
prised us all with its simple, 11-
track studio recorded format. I had
heard a bootleg tape of the record-
ings for the album shortly before
spring break, and although what I
heard was good, I expected a little
more from the boys on the real
thing. Although no additional songs
appear on the CD release, the mix-
ing and production of this album
does not fail to impress.

The album begins with
“Pleas”, an upbeat number that the

band began performing around the
beginning of October. Many of
you will remember the show that
Widespread put on in Johnston

Although Widespread Panic
is often lumped into the hippy-
music genre with bands like Blues
Traveler, Spin Doctors and Phish,

Plicity that transcends its limita-

tions in their songwriting. Unlike
their last self-titled album, Every-
day does not depend on long jams

about pioneers and Indians in the
Old West, and “Diner,” a rocking
number about one of the band’s
hangouts back in Athens.

they have a distinctive style that
separates them from their contem-
poraries. They do not possess an
ultimate virtuosity and complexity
like Phish, and they do not have a
single incredible talent to depend
-on like Blues Traveler’s John Pop-
per. They do, however, have a vi-
sion about their music and a sim-

others to create a sound that WSP
has worked for years to master.
In accordance with their
songwriting, the band has also im-
proved upon the production of their
recording. The last album featured
little or no overlays or ornamenta-
tion and the bass seemed
overmixed. Everydayis avery large

step in a positive direction. Dave
Schools’ bass is toned down, yetas
the mostaccomplished band mem-
ber on his instrument, his abilities
can still be clearly heard (see
“Hatfield,” “Papa’s Home”). Also,
John Bell’s voice is very polished
and seems to be growing stronger
with age. As for the surplus orna-
mentation, listen for extra guitar
layers throughout the album, espe-
cially on the first radio release,
“Wondering”.

The rest of the album features
many more treats. “Better Off” is a
rolling, Cajun-inspired number in
the Little Feat/ Meters vein that is
guaranteed to be playedat Patterson
Court gatherings. Also, Matt
Mundy from the Aquarian Rescue
Unit makes a mandolin appear-
ance on “Pickin’ Up the Pieces,”
and Daniel Hutchens of Bloodkin
makes a vocal appearance on a
cover of his song, “Henry Parsons
Died.” The album closes with the
Athens-favorite, “Postcard,” anda
very mellow “Dream Song.”

Now, those of you who are
still with me after this epic review
will be interested to know that
Widespread Panic will be perform- °
ing at Rocky’s (bleah!) in Char-
lotte on April 13th. I can’t think of
a better way to get ready for this
performance than going out to the
closestrecord store (Iendorse Repo
on Tyvola) and snatching up their
latest release, Everyday.

Students Attend Theatre

By Robert M. Ramsay

During the weekend of March
’ 4th, two Davidson seniors—Ed

Cunningham, an English Drama
major, and Nicole Scoggins, a The-
ater major—attended the South-
eastern Theater Conference in
Crystal City, Virginia, where they
auditioned for over 70 theater com-
panies from all over the country.

The auditions were a type of
recruitment, a search for talented
actors and actresses who would be
offered either summer or nine
month touring jobs. This was an
Opportunity for experience and
publicity of which both Ed and
Nicole took advantage.

The auditions functioned ac-
cording to tight time restrictions,
giving each actor only sixty sec-
onds to performs his or her mono-
logue. Later, each company posted
alist of the people it wanted to see
again. Those lucky few were called
in to do some improvisation, cold

readings, or to sing.

» Inhis minute, Ed performed a
comedic monologue from the play
Strange Snow by Steve Metcalfe.
“No one laughed,” he said with a
chuckle.

He must have impressed
someone, however, forelevencom-
panies called Ed back sothey could
see more. Because of time and
location conflicts, Ed could only
attend six.

Ed is hoping to continue com-
munication with the Ensemble
Theater of Cincinnati, where Ed-
ward Albee will be directing one
of his own new plays.

The position he has his sights
on is unpaid, but according to Ed,
“if you get a chance to work with
Edward Albee you don’t look for
money.”

At the same time, Nicole was
filling her minute with an original
piece based on a program called
“James Brown Word of the Day”

Conference

previously played on WPEG. She

received fourteen callbacks and
was able to attend twelve.

Nicole does have her eyes on
a certain company, -but she re-
frained from mentioning which one
for fear of bringing bad luck on the
process. She did say that it offers
a good salary, benefits, and travel
opportunities. She hopes to-hear
from them soon.

Nicole, who recently directed
aplay entitled/n My Mind, another
original script that celebrates the
lives of women, enjoyed the South-
eastern Theater Conference over-
all. “As rough as it was, it was kind
of exciting—you’re right there in
the hubbub.”

Nevertheless, Ed, who audi-
tioned for several schools in New
York earlier this year, was ner-
vous. On his way in he asked
someone, “What do we do if we
have to puke?” The response:
“Don’t.”

Davidsonian Oscar Picks Are a Sure Lock

Oscars continued from page 8

Emma Thompson, Howard's End.
If the indicators are correct, this
one will go to Thompson. How-
ever, there seems to be some heavy
betting on Susan Sarandon, who
was passed over for Thelma and
Louise last year.

Pfeiffer and McDonell aren’t
exactly out of the running either,
but Deneuve’s nomination is the
most blatant throwing of a bone
I’ve seen in a while. If I were a
gambling man, I’d go with Th-
ompson though. Best Director:
Robert Altman, The Player; Mar-

tin Brest, Scent of a Woman; Clint
Eastwood, Unforgiven; James
Ivory; Howard's End; and Neil
Jordan, The Crying Game.

This one’s pretty much a lock
for Clint. He won the Director’s
Guild of America award and usu-
ally anyone who wins thisalso gets
the Oscar.

Robert Altman also deserves
some props here, but considering
The Player skewered Hollywood,
I doubt the Academy will be kind.
Best Picture: The Crying Game; A
Few Good Men; Howard's End;
ScentofaWoman; and Unforgiven.
Usually, whoever wins for Best

Director, their film wins Best Pic-
‘ture.

It’s the law, I’m sure of it.
Look for Unforgiven to win this
one, bolstered by the comeback of
the Western with the win of
Dances With Wolves in 1990.

That just about wraps it up

forthis year. The Best Supporting P MO

Actor and, Actress categories are
basically a crap shoot, but I would
look for some big surprises here.

Anyway, I’ll be glued to the
screen rooting for my faves when
the show airs March 29— and I'll
be praying that 1993 is a better
year.

Come celebrate Spring Frolics with us!
