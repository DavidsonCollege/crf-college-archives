Four Student Study Wildlife
Management In Kenya

By Jennifer Sieck
“Hujambo Kenya!” Four
Davidson students said, “Hello

Kenya!” as they embarked on a
semester in Kenya this fall. Cath-
erine Harrington, Don Hastings,
Melissa Payne, and LeAnn Sim-
mons studied with 18 other college
and university students on the
Wildlife Management program,
sponsored by the School for Field
Studies. Their experience was
markedly different from other
study abroad programs in many
ways.

For three months, they lived
ona game ranch, the International
Wildlife Ranch and Research,
about 45 minutes southeast of
Nairobi (by Land Rover on un-
paved roads). Students took four
classes: Wildlife Management,
Cultural Ecology, Environment
and Society, and Population and
Community Ecology. In groups,

9 and 11 p.m. after doing home-
work by lantern-light.

Everyone slept in sleeping bags
in their bandas (thatched huts) or

students completed a research
project and presented a paper on
their study. Payne’s group exam-
ined “The Affects of Cattle in
Bomas on the Environment;”
Harrington and Hastings observed
with their group “The Affects of
Cropping on Grant’s and Th-
ompson’s Gazelles.”

A typical day on the ranch
included rising: at 7 a.m.; one or
two lengthy lectures (usually about
four hours apiece); going out on
the ranch in Land Rovers to do

in tents. (Payne defined a banda as
“athatched hut housing four people
and several spiders.”) There was
no electricity, no hot running wa-
ter, no inside bathrooms, no com-
mon phones or televisions. Bath-
room facilities included an en-
closed hole in the ground called a
choo, and gravity showers. Teams
of students took tums cooking
meals.

The group rode around the ranch
in Land Rovers to do research or to

goon game drives. Three times the
program went on safari, off the
ranch. On and off the ranch, the
group saw giraffe, elephants, ga-
zelle, impala, ostriches, cheetah,
oryx, lions, African buffalo, ver-
vet monkey, warthogs, hyrax,

. konguni, zebras, and wildebeests,

to name a few animals. Payne said
she “really liked being around
animals.” The program had a pet
cheetah; and, during the fall, some
ostrich chicks were found. on the
ranch and brought to the com-
pound to be raised.

Animals proved as potentially
dangerous as they were exciting to

see. “Some guys went jogging once

and got chased by a warthog,”
recounted Harrington. A dog had
gone with the runners and flushed
the animals out of the underbrush.
Someone else found acobracurled
up in a corner of the choo. Payne

When the temperature gets

warm up? The 900 Room was the
place to be to get warm last Fri-
day, Jan. 18. Cultural Events, In-
timate Performances, and the 900
Room sponsored a Chili Cookoff
for the second year. The chili
cooks and chili lovers had about
20 different recipes to chose from.
Here are the winners of the
cookoff, and their prizewinning
recipes.

MONTPELLIER, FRANCE-
While wasting away on yet an-
other French train as I do this
“Europe Thing,” I wonder how I
can possibly rescue my brain from
evolving into a baguette. So why
not write to that “worldly” and
ocasionally “weekly” paper
known as the Davidsonian?

Some Straight Facts
About The Draft

By Curt Bickers

Well, here is the article every
Davidson man has been waiting
for. Does the United States find the
cost of freedom in our innocence?

. The draft is definitely an ominous

presence many students have been
talking about over the past few
weeks, Now. more than ever, the
thought of receiving a Western
Union mailgram revealing my
destiny is chilling. I hope through

~ this article that I can dispel myths

and clarify shades of gray on this
pressing topic. I cite and thank the
Selective Service System for pro-
viding the information for this ar-
ticle.

The probability of a draft is the
most important issue to discuss.
Neither the National Director of
the Selective Service System,
Congress, the White House, nor
the Department of Defense has said
adraft is even under consideration.

The President has saidadraft is not
necessary. Congressional legisla-
tion and presidential approval are
both required in order to activate a
draft. The draft, it seems, takes a
litle bit more red tape to pass
through than pressing “the but-
ton.”

Let us pretend that the red tape
is snipped and the draft is. passed.
Mobilization procedures would
follow.. The Selective Service
System would be responsible for
supplying the manpower (the draft
seems to be the only situation these
days when the words “man” or
“he” can be used without seeming
sexist) through the induction proc-
ess. One hundred thousand induc-
tees are required by the end of the
first 30 days of mobilization. In-
duction is the infamous lottery
