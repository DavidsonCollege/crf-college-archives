results of this progress, with the-histori-

Carolina Railroading

Spanish Night Featured
by Speeches and Music

On Friday evening, April 20, the Span-
ish Club presented a varied program, the
main feature of which was a debate in
Spanish with the University of North
Carolina. John McKnight, president of
the club, introduced the different numbers
land acted as chairman of the debate.

After a brief address of welcome by
, McKnight, the sextet of the club sang
two Spanish songs, “La Chaparrita,” and
“La Golondrina.”

For the next hour the proposition, “Re-
solved: That the United States Should
Not Have Resorted to Armed Interven-
tion in Nicaragua,” was discussed by
Messrs. Mendez and Hayes, of Carolina,
who upheld the affirmative, and Messrs.
Weaver and Glenn, of the local club, who
supported the negative. A unanimous de-
cision was rendered in favor of the nega-
tive. An idea of the type of Spanish used
may be gained from the fact that Mr.
Mendez, of the Carolina team, is, him-
self, a native Cuban. The judges: were
teachers of Spanish from Queens and
Mitchell Colleges, and from Barium
Springs.

Following the debate, and before the
decision of the judges had been rendered,

|Seniors Celebrate

With Peppy Smoker

The first of a series of smokers was
held by the Senior class at the Maxwell-
Chambers hotel last Monday evening,
April 23rd, which practically all of the
class attended. The smoker was preceded
by free trip to the local cinema dispen-
sary at the invitation of the Stough
brothers, when Lon Chaney appeared on
long distance in “Laugh, Clown, Laugh.”
The smoker was enlivened by the melodies
of the “Trickle Trio” and an impromptu
rendition of some set-up exercises by
Madame Pavlowa, who: attended the
smoker in the disguise of our versatile
and well-beloved musimedian, Gordon Mc-
Swain, ;

These smokers may well be called re-
hearsals for Sob Day, as the festivities
ended with an acute attempt at harmony
in singing the college swan song, other-
wise known as College Ties. But to the
representative of the press (who was
much mortified at having to pay admis-
sion), the general feeling of good will was
very much in evidence, as gathered from
the bits of conversation which dribbled
down through the dense fog of smoke
clinging to the ceiling. With commence-
ment day but a short five weeks off, and
final preparations for leaving being made,
such a gatherifig was dominated by an
undercurrent of mature and dignified ex-
pectancy, of a nature known only to a
Senior, and many guesses ‘were hazarded
as to when and where this or that class-
mate would again be seen.

With Proc Thompson, Gordon Mc-

the Club Instrumental Quintet, composed
of Messrs. McKnight, T. T. Jones, Nichol-
son, A. J. Thompson, and A. F. Carr, en-
tertained the audience. After playing “In
a Little Spanish Town,” “La Paloma,” and
“Ramona,” in concert, Messrs. Jones and
Thompson responded to two encores.

Immediately after the result of the de-
bate was announced, a burlesque was
staged by several members of the club.
This was a farce of a Presidential Nom-
inatityg Convention, The meeting...ad-

journed with the singing of “O! David-
son,”

in English by the entire audience,
