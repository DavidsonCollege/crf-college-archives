DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

2

Presented by Top Dawg Entertainment

February 23, 2005

New Davidson cable channel announced

When dorm rooms were hooked up
for cable access last fall, a channel was
left unused and available for future use
by the College. Finally, last Monday,
Davidson announced what it plans to do
with the
empty space

left by the
channel.
Newly-
appointed
Dean of
Cable Chip
Douglas

explained
Davidson’s
long-term
plans. “We
will have a
full lineup of

program-
ming,” said
Douglas. The

temporarily
labeled
‘Davidson TV,’ is slated to launch in

, early April after Easter break.

Douglas said some programming has
already begun production, including

| Davidson TV’s upcoming reality show,
| “Vamanos Van Confessions.”

“The concept is a lot like HBO’s ‘Taxi

| Cab Confessions’,” said Douglas. “We
| installed a hidden camera in the

Vamanos Van last semester, and we’ve

been capturing some great stuff. It’s
really unbelievable the footage that we
have been able to accumulate in a short
period of time. I’m talking about singing
and chanting, arguments, hook-ups,

~ even a live childbirth.”

He described the show’s_ best
moments as being the interaction
between the sober driver and often
drunken passengers. Students praise or
berate the driver, argue over pickup and
drop-off points, or in one clip, try to
remove the driver’s pants during the
commute.

Douglas elaborated, “When I saw that

International students excited for Spring Break

Davidson College’s international stu-
dents are excited about their big plans
for the upcoming spring break.

Most international students stay at
Davidson over the short spring break
because their home countries are too far
away. However, that does not hinder
their ability to
have a good
time.

Manish
Suthar, a jun-
ior from New
Delhi, India
described one
of his favorite
activities to do
on _ spring
break at
Davidson.

and I love to

drink their milkshake in the fastest
time. I won at the Soda Shop, but later
that night I lost when I spent the whole
night with my head in the toilet. Spring
break baby! Does it get any better than
that?”

International student spring breaks
are not just con-
tent with athlet-
ics and dining;
some students
like to participate
in scholarly scav-
enger hunts with

their friends.
Ivana _ Poretzky
’o7_ «from St.

Petersburg,
Russia described
her late night
thrill ride.

with my friends

Dining experiences also provide great
spring break stories for the internation-
al students. Henri Démeunier ’07 from
Paris, France, reminisced about one of
his favorite spring break memories. “We
all wanted to go somewhere exotic for
our first spring break dinner in
Davidson so we finally decided to go to
the Soda Shop. After we ate our food, I
was challenged by my friends to a milk-
- shake drinking contest to see who could

College library and the Davidson town
library. Needless to say, we were cross-
referencing into the wee hours of the
morning and then laughed about our
academic experiences over some
sausage links at Waffle House.”

Sven Nordgaard’o5, from Stockholm,
Sweden, discussed other perks for stay-
ing at school for spring break. “Oh, it’s
great. When the other students who
went away for spring break first get back

to campus and drive into the Belk park-
ing lot, guess whose 1988 light blue
Saab they see parked in the first row five
feet away from Belk dorm? That’s right,
it’s all mine. Have fun walking from
satellite, suckers!”

Some American students were
shocked to learn that international stu-
dents stay on campus over spring break.
Bobby Macintyre ’07 said, “Why would
someone actually stay here? Get the hell
out while you can. Go get trashed on a

beach somewhere.”
Said Amber Smith ’06, “I would just

die if I didn’t get to go to Cabo San Lucas

for my break. There’s nowhere in
Davidson to get a good tan. I feel so bad
for the international students who stay
on campus.”

Others remaining on campus during
the week include the baseball team, both
male and female basketball teams, as
well as the cheerleading squad. It is still
unknown whether or not any of those
teams will participate in the interna-
tional students’ festivities.

Planned events for this year’s spring
break include a Chambers Lawn soccer
tournament, group meals at Bonsai and
the Soda Shop, and themed trivia
nights.

The security camera above the driver,
long unnoticed by passengers, catches
students in the rare unguarded
moments of their lives.

Often times, overstressed students,
uninhibited after alcohol consumption,
let loose on the Vamanos Van, and
“Confessions” catches every second of it.

“The transformation that many stu-
dents undergo is fascinating,” said
Davidson TV employee Ed Leach. “One

minute they’re stapling a recovered five
dollar bill to the wall. Three hours later,
they’re destroying everything in their
path. It’s like a cross between ‘Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde’ and ‘Revenge of the
Nerds.” \

Those worried about the repercus-
sions of being caught on tape need not
worry. The Honor Council has granted
immunity to students whose actions on
the show may be _ incriminating.
Davidson TV executives considered
immunity essential to the success of the
show. .

Students will be prosecuted only in
extreme cases, such as extensive proper-
ty damage or murder.

Despite the shenanigans, Douglas
said that the Vamanos Van paints the
quintessential picture of the Davidson
student. .

“They're excited, a little confused,
and not exactly sure what they are doing
or why they are doing it. But still, they’re
going places.”

Another show being discussed is a
reality show that takes place at various
Patterson Court parties. The concept,
similar to the hit program “Elimidate,”
involves four male Davidson students
each trying to talk and dance their way
into the heart of a young Davidson co-
ed.
“It’s going to be pretty awesome,”
said the show's producer, Jimmy Martin
‘06. “I’ve got a feeling that awkward
bombs are going to be dropped early
and often.”

Martin and Douglas hope to have a
few episodes ready by the time Davidson
TV hits the airwaves.

Other shows in the works include a
weekly Dance Ensemble set, a reality
show about the admissions process, a
“Fear Factor” involving food from Vail
Commons, and “World’s Funniest Lake
Norman Hospital Trips.”

A show that may involve what is clas-
sified as “soft-core” pornography is also
being decided upon, though it would
only be.shown late at night.

Those in charge of the station also
plan on having a new name by the time
that the multi-faceted channel is pro-
grammed and made available to the stu-
dent body.

“Davidson TV is a little too generic.
Right now we're trying to decide
between the Cat Channel and
Whiskervision,” said Douglas.

Sophomores
caught selling
tickets to the
housing lottery

With housing lottery right around the
corner, many Davidson freshmen are
beginning to feel the pressure of decid-
ing where they want to live next year.
But for some unsuspecting freshmen,
the ‘Housing Lottery’ turned out to be
one big scam.

It started out as an innocent prank,
but the prospect of making money
became blinding for Mark Adlewood ’07
and Stephen Truman ’07.

“All of these freshmen kept coming
up to us and asking about the housing
lottery,” Truman said. “At first we just
tried to explain the process and give
them some advice, but after about the
seventh freshman approached us, Mark
and I were surprised about just- how
clueless the freshmen were. So we got
this idea that we should selling them
tickets for the ‘Housing Lottery.’ ”

Whenever a first year would ask
Truman or Adlewood about the housing
lottery, they would say that they could
sell him or her a “lottoticket” for five
dollars. The duo told the first years stu-
dents that the ticket would guarantee a
lottery number in the top 100. of the
class.

Said Truman, “All of the freshmen
who bought these tickets were so thank-
ful because we told them if they did not
buy a ticket, their number would be ran-
domly chosen, and it was highly likely
that they would end up living in the
Sophomore Apartments. But, it was the
referrals that really helped us strike
gold. They would go tell their friends,
who would then come to us to buy tick-
ets. Before Mark and I knew it we had
made $200.”

But, Adlewood said, disaster struck
when the pair got overconfident. “We
really got caught up in the money and
started to feel invincible. That’s when
we started to take some stupid risks like
standing outside the Union saying ‘we
got the “Housing Lottery” tickets’ under
our breath and putting up an advertise-
ment in The Crier.” ,

After the Dean of Students got wind
of the scheme, the two were brought up
on Code of Responsibility charges for
sale of counterfeit items.

They have already been forced to
refund the money and, as an added pun-
ishment, are likely to be given the last
two lottery numbers.
