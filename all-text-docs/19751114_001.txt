Women: Success vs. femininity

By CATHY LANDIS
Staff Writer

In the November 1969 issue of Psychology
Today there is a report on Matina Horner’s Ph.D.
thesis on woman’s fear of success. ‘‘A bright
woman is caught in a double bind. In achievement
oriented situations she worries\not only about
failure, but also about success.”’

Based upon tests run on 90 women and 88 men
from the University of Michigan, she found that
the women get higher ‘‘test-anxiety’’ scores than
the men did, that the women scored higher on tests
when they were alone than they did in competition,
and that many students viewed intellectual
achievement as a loss of femininity.

In other words, she found that more women
feared success than did men. At the risk of
oversimplifying, the women in our society have
been taught to fear success. Society has assigned a
role to women, in most cases, inferior to that of
men. :

A successful woman, essentially, must break
away from that role. Total rebellion is frightening,
and most women prefer to compromise.

Does this problem exist at Davidson? The very
fact that there are women at Davidson indicates
some evidence that the women here have not only
already succeeded but plan to continue their
success. Yet the higher the education of a woman,
the more cause she has for the fear of success, for
bos’ possibility of attainment is greater. “The girls

in my sample who feared success also tended to
have high intellectual ability and histories of
academic success,’’ Horner reported.

Why do they do it?

Fear of success leading to the abandonment of
goals occurs in part because of societal expecta-
tions about the female role. Women want to
conform to the standard by which society
determines socially acceptable women. What is
this standard?

When asked about the way in which they
perceive femininity, many girls responded with
definitions such as, ‘Femininity is acting like a
lady.” “Not being overly aggressive.’ “Being
treated like a woman by a man.” ‘‘The whole way
of presenting yourself.” ‘‘The first thing that I
think of is the stereotype.’ ‘The first thing I think
of is a guy’s viewpoint.”

These women view femininity as an outside
quality which can be determined and judged by
how a woman presents herself. This view conforms
to what Sandra and Dary! Beem point out in their

An analysis

article, ‘‘Homogenizing the American Woman.”’

A test done in 1970 by Broverman, Broverman,
Clarkson, Rosenkrankz and Vogel exposed the
double standard of mental health in our society.
For a woman to be considered sane and thus
“Normal” she had to be ‘‘more submissive, less
aggressive, less competitive, more excitable, more
susceptible to hurt feelings, more emotional, more
conceited about her appearance, less objective,
more antagonistic about math and science.”

Said Erica Jong, author of Fear-of Flying,
‘Being a woman means, unfortunately, believing a
lot of male definitions.’’ In a poll of Davidson
women, 88 percent feel that they are feminine. Yet
many define femininity as being more submissive
than men. It is difficult to strive for success when
being submissive.

Council will approve Greek,

By STEVE PEEPLES
Staff Writer \

The Council on Social
Organizations met to clarify a
recent suggestion concerning
fraternity and eating house
membership invitations Wed-
nesday.

At a previous meeting Dave
Mayberry, head of the Coun-
cil, proposed that Patterson
Court houses give “‘bids’’ to
freshmen for membership.

Mayberry explained at the
meeting that the original pro-
porsal, ’’never made into a
motion,’’ was intended only as
a way to ‘‘give the Phi Gams
an even break”’ in the process
of self selection.

As the system is now set up,
the Gams, an off-campus frat-
ernity have to wait until the
night before self-selection to
issue written bids.

Bernhardt accepts position
as Annual Fund director

By SCOTT REID
Staff Writer

Thomas M. Bernhardt, Da-
vidson graduate of the class ot
'14, will be the college’s new
director of theAnnual Fund
beginning Monday, November
17, Bernhardt replaces How-
ard Arbuckle who vacated the
position earlier this year.

Bernhardt comes to. David-
son after having spent the
past year and a half working
for his home town of Lenoir,
North Carolina as an intern,
purchasing agent, assistant
finance director, and adminis-
trative assistant to the city
manager.

The Annual Fund is the
primary means by which Da-

vidson alumni and parents
support the yearly running of
the college. Traditionally it
has provided six percent of
that budget’s funding each
year.

Last year’s Fund had a
goal of $300,000 which it
exceeded by $15,000. The ’76 -
"717 annual budget has been
increased by ten percent over
this year. The Annual Fund’s
goal has been increased a
corresponding amount to
$350,000 for next year.

“It took us the last three
years to reach our $300,000
goal,’’ said 'Vice President. for
Development Craven E. Wil-
liams. “To go to $350,000 this
year is going to be a very big

challenge for Tom who is new
to-this business.

BERNHARDT

Dave Kitchins, representing
the house explained that they
were ‘‘trying to get along with
the council.’’ He cited a reluc-
tance to push the issue, but
that the present system placed
the Gams at a disadvantage.

In reference to his proposal,
Mayberry explained that he
and Jeff Neikirk, president of
the Patterson Court Council,
decided to wait to discuss the
matter with Dean of Students,
Will H. Terry.

‘Word got around that we
were trying to bring back the
old fraternity system while
Will was out of town. This just
wasn’t true,’’ said Neikirk.

Gary Barnes of PAX moved
that ‘‘the Fiji’s will be allowed
to make written bids starting
December 7th,”’ and that Pat-
terson Court operate on the
present system of encourage-
ment to freshmen.

John MacArthur of Emanon
suggested that this motion be
changed to allow fdr ‘‘verbal
invitations’’ by Court houses
starting on December 7th. He
also stipulated that this pro-
posal be ‘‘reconsidered in the
spring to set a date for next
year.”

Tentative approval

This motion ‘was given ten-
tative approval by the Coun-
cil, subject to a later vote to be
made after representatives
take a house vote if they so
desire.

After the meeting, May-
berry and Neikirk commented
on the confusion which ensued
after last week’s meeting.

“It got blown way out of
proportion. Written bids for
Patterson Court houses were
never proposed. I think the
work ‘bid’ confused people,”’
Neikirk said.

. eating club bids to freshmen

Mayberry emphasized: ‘‘My
original suggestion is essen-
tially the same thing as what
we passed tonight.

“This won’t allow on-
campus houses to do anything
new, but merely sets a stan-
dard date for the entire court
and the Gams to encourage
freshmen,” said Mayberry.

Both expressed confidence
that this ruling would in no
way change the process of self-
selection.

‘‘Representatives of the
national headquarters of the
fraternities come down here
about twice a year, and they’re
really impressed with our sys-
tem,” said Neikirk, although
it is not the normal process for
fraternities.

SPE not member

Commenting on the status
of the Sigma Phi Epsilon
(SPE) house, an off-campus
fraternity now not a member
of .the Council of Social
Organizations, Neikirk said:
‘It’s open for them to come
back at any time, if they want
toss

Terry also offered some
comments on the proposal and
subsequent uproar. “I think
it’s unfortunate that it was all
blown out of proportion. A full
discussion on bids would be
very useful.”’

Terry pointed out that even
had written bids for Patterson
Court been proposed, they
could not be brought back
except by a change in self-sel-
ection policy by the trustees of
the college.

He expressed satisfaction
with the present system of
encouragement without writ-
ten invitations.

“‘It would be unfair to the
freshnien to change strategies
at this point,’’ Terry said.
