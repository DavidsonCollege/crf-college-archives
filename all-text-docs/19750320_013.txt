Blue Ridge

Under moonshine, under stars, a-valley
cradled fog like water in cupped hands.
Black peaks linked round, rimmed

a bowl swirling, milky.

Fog tide drowned branchwaft; : :
muffled water chirps tumbling
over rock, water, over rock; .

lapped at the sandbag retreat,
a cabin bulk. :

blinked awake from hibercountry. | 3 seca ell
Warm-tongued fog tasted cabin cane. P
as a dog tests hands then feet, lillian gascoigne
moistening needlepad roof before aie :
mingling in woodpile.

Then like a scratch under chin,
behind ears,

fingers of smoke twitched out

the chimneystone sleeve to burrow
down in feather fog mane.
