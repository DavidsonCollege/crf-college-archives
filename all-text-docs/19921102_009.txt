Deep Thoughts:

Many of you have probably
seen the attractive young woman
on the poster with the ominous
headline, “KIDNAPPED.” Indeed,
Dail Dinwiddie has become quite
famous since she disappeared after
the U2 concert in Columbia, SC. in
late September. Her attractive vis-
age now graces telephone poles
and window panes all over the
Southeast. U2 has even begun
broadcasting there image on their
widescreen television system at
their concerts. I personally wish
Dail’s image -weren’t so well-
known.

I grew up about two blocks
from Dail Dinwiddie and rode the
bus to school with her until I was in
the seventh grade. I would notcon-
sider her one of my closest friends,
but I liked her and always thought
she was genuine and kind-hearted.
She was a tiny person, one quite
vulnerable to the crime of which
she has most assuredly been the
victim. The night on which she
was abducted, she was in a part of
Columbia frequented by young
people. Friends count on seeing
one another there when they come
home from school. My mother lives
about five blocks away.

What scares me most about
Dail Dinwiddie’s abduction is that
it was accompanied by the fright-
ening incident in Charlotte in which
two of Davidson’s own narrowly

escaped harm at the hands of two

armed youths. My family tells me

practice and had to call the police.
Stories like these can send one
headlong into hysteria if not taken
in the right perspective.

We are so fortunate to live in
this quaint village we call home for

four years. It is so comforting to-

think that there is still a place in the
world where just about everyone
knows each other’s names and the
dogs can sleep in the road at night.
Recent events, however, serve as a
shocking reminder that ‘the larger

world isaharsh place, one in which
the naive get hoodwinked and the
majority of folks live all too cau-
tiously, allowing fear to control
their behavior. I must remind my-
self when I wander down our quiet
avenues that an alarm system al-
lows my mother to sleep at night
and many of the women I know
have invested in cellular telephones
purely for security reasons. These
realizations are so shocking, I sup-
pose, because they bring us to terms
with the fragility of our own exist-
ence.

We are all beginning to exit
that portion of our lives in which
we have felt blissfully immortal—
able to: escape harm despite the
lengthsof ourrecklessness. Events
like those we have seen lately drive
many behind defensive barriers
from the’ mean and cruel world.
The carelessness of their youth
becomes an artifact of the past.
Hence, the challenge that tragedies
like Dail Dinwiddie’s kidnapping
make for all of us is to maintain a
balance between living in terror
and shrugging off dangers
overzealously. Remember that we
are on this Earth for far too short a
time to lock up the front door and
booby trap the yard. Just be selec-
tive about who you letin the house.
And pray for Dail if you get a
chance .

Ifsomeone were tocome up to

the right course for me?” Immedi-

Davidson Perspective where he
could peruse at his leisure through

after courses. A bit later he’d re-
turn and happily announce that he’s
going to select the same courses he
took last semester; then he’d sucker
punch me. Finding the rightcourse
takes diligence, ingenuity, open
communication with professors, an
understanding of what goals you
have in life, a pair of dice, a dart
board, and an ouija thingy. All of
these things can be found at your
local, friendly, neighborhood Se-

Mr. Senior sir, what math class
should I take? :

MR. SENIOR: I'd take Ab-

your mind to a senscless

Some people were disap-
pointed in Spike’s presentation,
because they expected him to be
more inflammatory. Perhaps
people expected him to try to pro-
voke us, but we think he did well to
keep the tone of the discussion
calm. Much more is accomplished
through understanding and reason
than through anger. Perhaps people
expected him, because of his me-
dia image, to come to Davidson
and say “I hate white people” so
they could talk about “the nerve of
that bigot to come to our school
and say those things to us after we
paid so much”. Realize, however,
that the media hypes everyone and
twists people’s words to get arise

out of the public. We didn’t think
his comments were racist. On the
contrary, Spike challenged media
charges that he is a racist, and his
replies to questions seemed to call
for awareness and acceptance
rather than separation.

It’s also important to remem-
ber that Spike Lee is a filmmaker.
He may be concerned about the
future of race relations in America,
but his first priority is how he can
make his audience think about the
issues he chooses to discuss in his
films. He doesn’t necessarily pro-
vide solutions to the issues, but
rather presents a current, realistic
situation and challenges the viewer
to provide a solution. We can’t
look to him or his films for the
answers, though there are often
strong currents of racial harmony
(yes there are, look closely). If we
want to find the solution to racism,
we have to start with the way we
lead our lives and how we can
better interact with the people
around us.
