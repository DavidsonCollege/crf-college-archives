Hours Fee Incongruous

The most amazing thing about agi-
tation over the $15-per-hour-over-16-
hours fee is that no one has be-
come disturbed about it before. The
charge is incongruous, not only be-
cause of a number of peculiar situa-
tions that arise in its application, but
because of a basic inconsistency in the
justification behind it.

ROTC courses cause the most in-
equity in the administration of the
eharge. The two hours per semester of
Basic ROTC do not count towards the
hallowed 16-hour limit, but juniors
and seniors in the Advanced ROTC
program have the three hours counted
against them.

The question arises as to why the
basic course should not be included
in a student’s total number of hours
when the advanced is. Immediately
one will answer: “The basic course is
required, while the last two years
aren’t.”

So are Bible, English, math, lan-
guage and other courses ad infinitum,
required, but they’re certainly includ-
ed when the great tally is made.

Is it possible, that somewhere, deep
within the recesses of the hearts of
the powers that be, there lurks a feel-
ing that required ROTC is contrary
to the idea of a liberal arts education
and that they compensate by not mak-
ing hapless freshmen and sophomores
liable for the charge.

But before cursing the fate of be-
ing saddled with Basic ROTC, dis-

gruntled underclassmen should stop
and think—those not enrolled in the
basic course, for one reason or an-
other, are trapped in a worse bind.
Coupled with the current restriction
on freshmen taking 13 hours, that is,
four academic courses, it is impossible
for these unfortunate students to get
through their college career without
exceeding the 16-hour limit at some
time.

If the justification for the charge
is the extra expenses forced on the
college, why should not the Advanced
ROTC hours be exempted as are the
basic hours? Uncle Sam. not the col-
lege, is footing the bill for the ROTC
program and it works no hardship on
the school’s expenses for students to
be enrolled in the ROTC program
along with regular academic courses.

Not only does the charge introduce
a number of inconsistencies in its
practical application, it lacks any con-
sistent philosophical justification.
After a student has paid his tuition,
the only limit on ‘his course load
should be what he can responsibly
maintain. There is no justification for
telling a student that his “education”
consists of a set number of courses.

The Business Office has justified
the charge on the grounds that “if
you buy a tie, it costs extra.” If this
is to be the reasoning, why not charge
students the general fee on the basis
of how thoroughly they read THE DA-
VIDSONIAN or the social fee on how
many functions of the Social Council
they attend, rather than a set fee?

Time For Student Initiative

There has been no shortage of stu-
dent gripes about every conceivable
academic’ aspect of the college, most
of which will be considered in the up-
coming years in the curriculum revi-
sion program. But it take little initia-
tive to bitch, and a number of people
are sceptical about how seriously stu-
dents take their interest. in the col-
lege’s academic life.

Action by the faculty’s Curriculam
Committee so far would encourage
many, to think that the faculty puts
little stock in student interest or in-
volvement in curriculum reform. Ad-
mittedly, the faculty failure to recog-
nize a strong student voice will make
student opinion less strongly felt, but
it should be cause for a renewed de-
termination on students’ part to in-
volve themselves in the study now be-
ginning, rather than a resignation to
token participation,

THE DAVIDSONIAN will be under-

Welcome, Scott

A welcome new member of the Da-
vidson family will be arriving on cam-
pus within days. The Rev. Scott Wood-
mansee, new college chaplain, will be
filling a position that could well be
one of the most significant of any at
the school.

Success with experiments in new
modes of corporate worship at David-
son will rest to a great degree on the
leadership and initiative of the college
chaplain. We are confident Rev. Wood-
mansee will be a major force in guid-
ing Davidson's religious fortunes, not
only in organized worship. but also in
the other less tangible but no less sig-

Cold Feet

The current issue of Time examines
a “new” fad among the nation’s col-
lege students: socklessness. The ar-
ticle doesn’t go on to explain its defi-
nition of “new”, but the distinct im-
pression it leaves is that the author
has never been to Davidson.

For one reason or another, students
here have gone sans-socks for more
years than the preponderance of the
present student generation has been
here. It’s become something of a sym-
bol of the “cool” Davidsonian. Dr. W.
B. Hight once remarked that “I can’t
imagine anything worse than being a
sock salesman in Davidson.

The magazine offers several ob-

taking in the coming week a campaign
to raise money for use by the Student
Council's Curriculum Committee to
undertake an independent ‘curriculum
study. The drive will serve a two-fold
purpose.

In the first place, widespread stu-
dent participation will indicate to the
faculty that students ARE interested
in what direction the study takes. Sec-
ondly, the funds wll give the commit-
tee the financial solvency and inde-
pendence to undertake private proj-
ects, such as visits to other schools,
correspondence and bringing in speak-
ers who are familiar with current
thinking in educational circles.

In asking for only one dollar from
each student, THE DAVIDSONIAN is
attempting to encourage a wide stu-
dent participation, as opposed to a
vertical effort aimed at drawing larg-
er amounts of money from a smaller
section of the student body.

nificant aspects of the college’s relig-
ious commitment.

The new chaplain will considerably
ease the work of Davidson's chaplain
emeritus, Will Terry, who since last
spring has played a dual role of pastor
at the College Presbyterian Church,
as well as serving as acting chaplain.
Fortunately, Mr. Terry has no inten-
tion of giving up contacts with stu-
dents while relinquishing the chap-
laincy.

Davidson is fortunate to have the
resources of two such men in the sig-
nificant period it is entering.

scure suggestions for the acceptance
of the naked foot, such as the esthetic
{a third texture between pants and
shoes interrupts the natural-harmony)
and sexual (“hairs on the ankle look
Provocative’). Such answers leave us
cold.

It’s perfectly obvious that the utili-
tarian motives of comfort and conven-
ience, more than any abstract ideas,
drive students to socklessness. Time
suggests that many students may have
taken up the habit because “their
socks are in the laundry bags.” More
likely, they never came back from the
laundry.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Kendrick Denounces Davidson's ‘Gnomes’

Dear Editor:

A dirge has infected the Da-
vidson College campus — a
dirge that was severely at-
tacked but nonetheless _ still
runs rampant in our (and I
use this word loosely) society,

This curse encompassing
none but the periphery of hu-
manity, none but the vilest hu-
man beings, none but the trag-
edies of birth, the charlatans,
the hypocrites, the swine, the
scum off the vinegar vats,
none other than (and may God
have mercy on their souls)

—,

> =

the gnomes.

Now some of you, particular-
ly lower classmen, are prob-
ably wondering what is this
manner of man (and I use
that word loosely), I ‘refer to
as a gnome. I will do my best
to explain their mode of ex:
istence in the following list
of gnome characteristics:

IMPOSING BOOK

1.) A gnome studies at least
11 hours per day, devoting an-
other seven to sleep. The rest
of the gnomish day is com-
posed of attending class to

which he usually carries an
imposing book and note-filled
satchel. This is of course not
to insinuate that all satchel-
carriers are gnomes.

2.) The typical gnome is a
“guck"’; i.e., he spends several
minutes alter each class peri-
od asking his professor ques-
tions to which he already
knows the answer. This ingra-
tiating, sycophantic process
usually works because most
teachers are oblivious to his
gnomish designs.

3.) The gnome is in bed

promptly at 11:00 p.m. and

insists vehemently that all oth-
er noise cease when he re-
tires.
RARELY DATES

4.) The gnome rarely dates
because of the difficulty of
finding anyone as pitiful as
he. Also the problem of com-
munication arises because the
gnome has difficulty in con-
versing in anything but intel-
lectual terms.

5.) The gnome has absolute-
ly no athletic propensity. He
believes that the physical as-

College Administrations Resist
Student Voice In Policy-Making

(EDITOR'S NOTE: In light
of the current controversy on
campus concerning student
participation in college policy-
making, THE DAVIDSONIAN
prints the following article
from the Associated Collegiate
Press. The author is Marilyn
Swartz, ACP news analyst.)

Despite apparent administra-
tion concessions to demands
for ‘“‘student power" at col-
leges across the country, stu-
dent protest has often result.
ed in attempts to contain the
activist energies; a few “‘lead-
ers" are placed in token com-
mittee positions or merely
“consulted when decisions
are made.

But students are making
their disapproval known.

It seemed that University of
Michigan students would have

an opportunity to affect ‘high-
level decisions when Regents
authorized student advisory
boards for the President and
Vice Presidents in a meeting
October 21.

The committees were orig-
inally proposed by students,
and any student is eligible for
membership on the five- to
eight-man boards.

When asked what the effect
of the new boards would be,
Vice President for Student
Affairs Richard Cutler said,
‘Some students who are mem-
bers of advisory groups may
understand administrators’
problems better . . ."’ That
could be translated. “If you
can't lick ‘em, let ‘em join
you.” .

At the same meeting. how-
ever, the Regents provoked
strong doubts as to whether

students would actually have
more say in affairs of the uni-
versity. The Regents voted
Cutler sweeping powers over
non-academic conduct. He was
granted:

—‘‘ultimate authority’ over
student's extra-curricular life;

—authority for an “immedi-
ate and comprehensive re-
view" of all student regula-
tions;

—power to review existing
regulations of Student Govern-
ment Council; and

—power to establish neces-
sary interim regulations until
the “immediate and compre-
hensive review” is completed.

In. conducting the review of
all student regulations, the
Regents said Cutler should
consult ‘academic, student
and staff authorities.’

No one knows, however, how

‘She Stoops’ Conquers

Opening-Night Audience

“The comic Muse, long sick,
is now a-dying!*’ said Oliver
Goldsmith in London in 1773
and an unnamed student pass-
ing the TV in Belk this Wed-
nesday night.

ence in Hodson Hall Thursday,

ment’s production of ‘She

end.

Dr. Samuel Johnson said of
the play that ‘tno comedy for
many years has so much ex-
hilarated an audience:.has an-
swered so much the great end
of comedy, making an audi-
ence laugh.”

‘The laughter of the Thurs-
day performance was loud and
often, fast and loose, and it
carried over between scenes
in an excited murmur that
covered even the noises of the
set changes.

been partly chosen for pro-
duction with junior Marvin

it fairly runs away with his
tongue). The play is one that
requires a great deal of spirit,
and everyone involved has ob-
viously given it.

Richard Lonon as Marlowe
plays very funnily the David-
son Gentleman's awkwardness
on his “blind date’’ (in the
days when that meant an ar-
ranged marriage) with Miss
Kate Hardcastle played by Pa-
tricia Whitley, who stoops and
conquers.

The foibles and faces of
Timothy Gailey as Mr. Hard-
castle, the “uncommon _inn-
keeper” draw some of the best
laughs of the evening, as do
the hysterics of his wife, play-
ed by Mrs. Mary Bradford.
Perhaps the most consistently
‘in’ character’ performance
is that of Mrs. Jane Crawley,
the pretty and levelheaded
lover of the impatient gentle.
man Hastings, acted by fresh-
man John Ferguson.

The amount of ‘‘jitters’’ on
the first night is perhaps pro-
portionate to the number of
Hines a character has in the
play. At any rate the cool and
consummate performances of
a number of minor roles steal
many laughs in the early part
of the play and move the
spirit of it at a very high level
through the difficulties of the
opening.

As a lamplighter, or perhaps

the comic Muse, Richardson
scholar Jergen Schlunk, Da-
vidson’s own German lepre-
chaun, acts out a silent sort
of prologue to the play.

Clay Ford's buttons and Lyn
Montague’s fine ROTC style
are hilarious bits of low com-
edy in the muster of the Hard-
castle servants, and Bill Gra-
ham's innkeeper part is the
gauntest spectacle outside of
a Ben Gunn with the face of
poor Yorick.

Plays directed by Rupert
Barber, head of the Speech
and Drama Department, are
always technical wonders of
Staging, and in ‘‘She Stoops to
Conquer” he has made the best
and most imaginative use of
every inch of a simple design
involving the small roll-on
stage and two side doors onto
the downstage area, though the
best that can be said for the
sets themselves is that they
never got in the way of the
swift and funny action.

The costumes designed by
Mrs. Carol Barber are not
only dazzingly beautiful, but
are also in many cases fine
and subtle technical bits of

. characterization.

“A laughing, and even low
comedy,"’ Goldsmith called his
sort of play in its preface. If
it is low, she stoops, of course,
to conquer. Come, see it, and
be conquered.

much Cutler will consult. Mark
Killingsworth, Michigan Dally
editor, charged that the Re-
gents’ move gives Cutler
“something close to dictatori-
al power.”

Some schools have refused
students a voice altogether.
When the retirement of Gouch-
er College President Otto
Kraushaar was announced this
year, students wanted a voice
in the selection of his succes-
sor.

They intend to sample stu-
dent. opinion on the qualities
necessary for the Goucher
presidency, but their attempts
may be to no avail. They have
already been told by a mem-
ber of the President Selection
Committee that students can-
not pass ‘‘mature’’ judgment.

Not to be daunted, editors
of the student newspaper are
demanding representation on
the committee. Professor Ken:
neth Walker retorted that the
need for secrecy is endangered
with every additional person.

There are times when fac-
ulty and administrators are
“very generous" in giving stu-
dents a voice. At Iowa State
College, a committee was
formed including the faculty,
one administrator, two mem-
bers of the community and
last, but perhaps least, two
students,

pects of life have no place in
our society, thus the gnome’s
body is completely degenerate.
He has marked difficulty in
carrying his satchel from
class to class and in climbing
the steps to the library.

6.) When a term paper is
assigned the gnome scurries
to the library and checks out
all the relevant books so that
the rest of the class has no
chance to use them.

NO BORROWING

7.) The gnome cannot stand
for one to borrow his notes.
He usually claims that some-
one else has them or that he
left them at the library.

8.) His weekly entertainment
consists of a rollicking time at
Hattie’s, drinking Country Club
in quarts and being obnoxious
‘in general.

9.) The gnome's extra cur-
ricular activities consist of sit-
ting on the front row at Open.
End, picking his beard. smok
ing his pipe, and asking irrele-
vant questions. Some gnomes
prefer to merely throw fris
bees on Chamber's lawn. in.
stead of hurling invectives at
the Union.

NOTES VS. HISS

10.) The gnome's approval
of a chapel speaker is signi .
fied’by his taking notes. where-
as his disapproval is voiced
with frequent hissing.

11.) The gnome is consider-
ably upset when either an ath-
letic contest or a concert (es-
pecially Rock and Roll, which
the gnome detests) is audible
at the library. '

12.) The gnome applies for °

scholarships at every graduate
school, knowing full well that
he is hurting the chances of
others applying for the same
scholarships. This is of course
after the gnome has decided
where he really wants to go:

because of his superior aca- .

demic record, he can go.
AGAINST DRINKING

13.) His voting record on
campus includes a vote against
on-campus drinking and for
the continuation of Vespers.

14.) The gnome never cuts
class or overcuts chapel. In
addition the gnome has never
received a parking ticket at
Davidson College—a next to
impossible feat.

15. )The gnome takes a
shower approximately once a
month, thus his room always
smells bad.

Underclassmen hear me out
(for you seniors that recognize
these gnomish characteristics
in yourselves, I'm afraid it's
too late): Study the above
characteristics and if you rec-
ognize any or all of them in
yourselves do something about
it. Please help me stamp out
the. gnomes from the Davidson
campus.

Helm Indicts Laxity
In Facilities Repair

Dear Editor: ~aors

Everyone else seems to be
making a mule of himself by
complaining about one thing
or another, so I thought I'd
join the crowd.

In case any freshmen, soph-
omores or anyone else who
has used the swimming pool
recently has noticed a layer
of fog over the pool or has
noticed frostbite developing on
his feet while walking across
the deck, it’s because the heat-
ing system is not working
(brilliant deduction).

“Bet you don't know why it's
not working. am oer

If you guessed because the
heating system hasn't been
turned on or because the sys-

- tem is broken, you guessed

right.

Do you know why the above
situation exists?

If you guessed the grounds
committee hasn't fixed the
system (rotten pipes which
run under the floor of the
pool, lower gym and wrestling
room), you're right again.

Do you know when the
leaky heating system was dis-
covered?

Would you believe last
spring?

Now that you know why and
how long the pool has been
exceptionally cold. I'm sure
you’d like to join me and the
rest of the swim team in offer-
ing our sincere congratula-
tions to the grounds commit-
tee for acting promptly, over
the summer, to repair the
heating system in the pool
area so that we who use the
facilities will be kept warm
and healthy over -the cold
winter months.

Congrat . . . (just can't do
it)—(cough, sniff, cough).
