Housing director anticipates Career change

By KIRBY OWEN
Staff Writer

After 15 years as Director of
Student Housing, Scotty Nich-
olls will be resigning at the end
of this fiscal year.

Nicholls pointed out, ‘‘I’m
not retiring, just resigning from
this job. I’ve been planning for
some time that I would resign
after this year and I tendered
my formal resignation in the
fall. I’ve been doing this for 15
years and I think it’s time to
turn it over to someone else.”
Nicholls noted, however, that
they still haven’t found a rep-
lacement.

As for her future, Nicholls
said, ‘‘I’m hoping I'll find
another job somewhere but I’m
not sure what I want to go into.
I would love to continue to work
for the college if there was some
job available that I qualified

after Erwin voluntarily left the
auditorium.

Professors John Kello and
Sam Maloney both read the
letters they were composing and
planning to send to Erwin and
the Media Board. Kello said Jast
week’s Supplement contained
“the ugliest, most vicious char-
acter assassinations along with
sharp wit.”

Maloney called it a ‘‘misuse
of trust’’ that should ‘‘not be
repeated in this student genera-
tion.’’ He said whoever wrote
the descriptions of some mem-
bers of the Biology and English
departments in particular re-
vealed a ‘‘distressing lack of
compassionate sensitivity.”

‘What recourse do these
people have to unsigned arti-
cles?’’, Maloney asked.

‘‘What should be done to
students who steal the repu-
tations and good names of

members of the community...?”
he added.

Philosophy professor Robert
Maydole also addressed the
issue of unsigned descriptions.
He said Erwin exercised poor
judgment in accepting, and
then printing, articles whose
writer was not known. But he
added that Erwin ‘should not
bear the brunt of the responsi-
bility.”

for.
Nicholls added that she was

not going to leave Davidson,
saying “This is my home.

The Nicholls moved here in
1963 but Scotty feels that it’s
time for a change. ‘So much
has changed and yet in some
ways nothing has changed. In
working with a constantly
changing population, with the
arrival of new students every
year, there’s bound to be excite-
ment every year and it keeps
you on your toes.

“I have loved the job, thor-
oughly enjoyed it, but I feel as
though I’ve done it all and I
would rather move on to some-
thing else. I don't want to reach
the point where I’m weary of it
that I'm no longer interested
in the people. It is time to bring
in a new person. We make our
best strides forward and prog-

ress faster when there is some-
one new.

“It is time for a change,”
Nicholls concluded.

this issue.’’ He explained that
the Supplement began with a
positive goal — it was intended
to mock the SGA’s course
evaluation guide that was com-
piled several years ago to help
incoming freshmen choose their
courses.

Caldwell added there was
never any malicious intent; the
maliciousness that resulted he
attributed jto “a total failure of
organieatian.’’

Maloney retorted, ‘‘It’s not
an organizational problem, it’s
a moral ptoblem.”’

But then English professor
Charles Lloyd rebounded, ‘‘It’s
not a moral one, it’s a joke that
backfired. All we can do is walk
away from it.”

“It takes a long, long time to
make a good joke. If I make
even one before I die, I'll be
happy,’”’ Lloyd said.

One question that frequently
arose at the meeting was the
amount of action that should be
taken against those who partici-
pated in the Supplement. ‘‘Rak-
ing up the past does no good”
Lloyd said.

“I don’t think it would be
useful to dig them (the partici-
pants) up,’’ Caldwell recom-
mended.

Davidsonian Executive Edi-
tor Bill Peeples said some
contributions to the Supple-
ment were submitted anony-
mously, while some staff mem-
bers acknowledged at the meet-
ing they were lapse in not

- knowing the exact contents of

what was to be printed.

“If the editor does not know
what's going-in the paper, he is
ee Kello said.

student pointed out that
because of the very nature of a
spoof the editor should be aware
of all its contents.

Physics professor Robert
Manning said he fears the guif
this issue might create between
students and faculty. “What
pote Z worth teaching at

avidson?”’ (‘It’s certainly not
the Trustees,” he kidded.) He
said it is the closeness and
integrity of the community —

. the relationshin bet

tween sty-
aents"ana faculty here, ioe

“We can’t think of it in terms
of ‘them and us,’ but a com-
munity,’’ Manning added.

SGA President John Jackson
stressed the issue in no way was
representative of the thoughts
of the student body. ‘‘Students
are concerned (over this mis-
representation) — their turnout
here today indicates that,” he
said.

Davidsonian Business Mana-
ger Martin Hunter cleared the
air over the confusion surround-
ing the typewritten letter that

appeared at the beginning of the
Supplement. He explained he

saw the unfinished letter in a ©

typewriter in the Davidsonian
office and ‘‘couldn’t resist”’
finishing it.

“But lo and behold it got
printed,” he said.

‘I don’t know how it got
Harry’s (Harry Greyard) signa-
ture on it,’’ Hunter added.

Davidsonian Senior Opinions
Editor George Murdaugh con-
cluded the discussion session
by saying, “He (Erwin) may
have failed in responsibility,
but he does care a lot about the
faculty.”

explained, ‘“‘We must work to
improve faculty and student
relations and we must keep a
closer watch over what is

negative attitude toward us.

On the future of The David-

training is concerned. Our first
objectives are to restore the
paper’s credibility and to re
