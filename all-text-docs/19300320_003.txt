At the 'Cats as Spring
Sports Begin
By P. R. Alderman

Tryouts and practices are still the order
of the day as far as sports are concerned
on the campus, After so long a period
without such, an intercollegiate. contest
becomes a_highly-anticipated treat for
every one with any tendency at all to-
wards athletics.

Thus the game today with George-
town University and the one tomor-
row with Oak Ridge should not fail
to give all lovers of America’s most
popular sport quite a bit to look for-
ward to. This category probably in-
cludes all at Davidson.

Moreover, as has been stated before, a
nine that has heretofore not been seen in
action will be on exhibition for all critics,
favorably and unfavorably inclined.

As will be remembered by those
who were here last year, the George-
town nine was more or less easily de-
feated by the Wildcats, which makes
things look rather optimistic for the
opening game although it does not
necessarily spell a Davidson victory.

On the other hand, the Oak Ridge Ca-
dets should prove a stiffer trial for Coach
Monk’s men. They were a little too
strong for the ‘Cats last year and there
are no indications that they won't try to
repeat past deeds.

It has been asserted that the 1930
wrestling team was one of the best
turned out by ep reds
years. This statement is warranted by
the fact that practically all of the
Wildcats’ matches were either won
or if not, were lost by very close
scores. Injuries: were evident draw-
backs to the ’Cats throughout the
season,

in recent

The matmen will feel the loss next year
of those graduating in. June. Pi Conway,
captain-elect, will have quite a bit of work
on his hands, being aided by compara-
tively green mates. Brock, Raker, Cowan,
Gorham and Boyles complete the letter-
men returning.

Likewise in basketball—only three
lettermen will be on hand next year
around which to build a five, Good-
son, Rusk and Proctor. Rising sopho-
mores and this year’s substitutes
brighten the outlook considerably,
however.

With a game next Monday, the Wild-
kittens have some stiff workouts ahead of
them in order for Coach Laird to round
out a nine. The brunt of the work will
probably fall on former prep school stars
in the first games.

Davidson seems to be assured of a
winning golf team for the next few

Junior Class Team Wins
Intramural Track Meet

Freshmen Win Second Place With
35 Points—Sophomores and
Seniors Third and Fourth

WHITTLE HIGH POINT MAN

Bad Weather Makes Running Time
Slow

The Juniors splashed their way to a decis-
ive victory in the Interclass track meet Mon-
day afternoon amassing a total of 55 1-4
points to show their heels to the Freshmen
who followed with 35 3-4 points. The Sen-
iors and Sophomores followed with 31 and
19 points respectively. The meet was run
off in a cold drizzle which did not let up
during the afternoon and prevented some of
the speedsters from opening up and showing
their wares. All of the track events were cut
down in distance as this was only a condi-
tioning meet held early in the spring and no
particular attention was paid to the timing.
The first four places were counted.

High point honors went to Heath Whittle
who amassed a total of 15 points by taking
first in the 70 yard dash, first in the 70 yar¢
high and low hurdles. McCall followed witl
10 points winning the broad jump and_ the
javelin throw. Both Whittle and McCal!
have been showing up well lately, the former
in the low hurdles. and the latter in the
javelin throw. In this event McCall has
been reaching around 175 feet continually
Among other varsity men showing up well
were Brannon in the two mile, Brohard in
the 440 which was cut down to 300 yards in
this meet, and Allen who gave.Gardner quite
a battle in the high jump. The Freshmen
showed up well in the meet with Fleagle
taking the leading role by winning the 170
yard dash and placing second in the 70 yard
dash. Earle also pufled a surprise by winning
out over “Pete” Lafferty in the 3-4 mile
after running a beautiful race. The Fresh-
men havé been showing up well in the sprints
but have been sadly neglected by some
husky weight men and also the distance men
are scarce.

This meet still leaves the Seniors ahead
in the Intramural sports contests with 82 1-2
points, a slim margin over the gaining Fresh-
men who have 80 points to their credit. The
Junior and Sophomores follow close behind.

There still remains, however, four events
to decide the winner of the shield. There are
tennis, golf, Sigma Delta Psi Athletic Fra-
ternity competition, and the physical im-
provement competition. Sigma Delta Psi will
award a special trophy cup to the winner
and certificate of membership will be paid
to the next two high scorers.

years. Of the four first-ranking can-
didates, one is a junior—Capt. Jack
Pepper—and two are freshmen, Wag-
ner and Thompson. Lewis Hart,
fourth member of the quartet, is the
only senior on the team.

There will be no more football now un-
til next fall—spring practices ending last
Saturday with Army victorious over
Navy. If nothing happens, the Wildcat
eleven of 1931 will start the season with
the prospects about as bright as they’ve
ever been for a Davidson grid team.

Kittens Show Good
Baseball Prospects

Under the skillful leadership of Coach
Flake Laird the Wildkitten baseball squad
began regular practice about the middle of
last week. A squad of approximately thirty
men answered the first call. According to
Coach Laird, the prospects appear to be very
promising for the Frosh to: maintain on the
diamond their fine athletic standing in other
fields of sport.

At the time there thirfeen
games on the schedule with the probability
that others will be added later. Only two
of these will be played before the spring
Holidays. Belmont Abbey opens the season
here on March the 24th. The Kittens will
then go to Mt. Pleasant on March 26th
where they will meet the Mount Pleasant
Collegiate Institute. A complete schedule
may be found in the last issue of the David-
sonian.

present are

Although nothing definite about the proba-
ble line-up can be determined at such an
early date, some of the aspirants for berths
have made very good showing. In the pitch-
er’s box, Rogers, Pearce, Baily, and Bar-

rier, have shown up well. It is probable that
these men will beat the brunt. of the burden
with Brown and Mackorell to complete the
staff. On the other end of the battery will
probably be Whitley, or McFie.

Pierce will hold down first base according
to present indication, with Morrison giving
him a good run for the position. Richards is
leading in the struggle for second base,
closely followed by Stuart, Howe, and Pea-
body. Either Moore or Mills will probably
play short-stop. At present) Thomason. is
the only man out for third. In the outfield
will, probably be Bradsher, Morrison, How

ard, or Moseley.

Athletic Night To B
Held .

Decision was reached by the
Athletic Association to again have
the annual Athletic Night, as has
been customary for some years.
This I was reached after
a vote taken in chapel showed the
student body to be in favor of the
continuance of it.

Certificates will be awarded to the
men making letters during the year,
and gold footballs will be presented
to the members of the football
team. Prominent speakers will also
be engaged for the program.
