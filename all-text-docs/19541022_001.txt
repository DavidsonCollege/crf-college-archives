Y.M.C.A. Sponsoring
Voluntary Devotional

In order to fill a need for those
students who have expressed a de-
sire to have a Monday morning de-
votional period, the Y.M.C.A. is
sponsoring a voluntary chapel ser-
vice each Monday morning in the
Lingle Chapel at 10:25.

Leighton Green, president of
the Y.M.C.A., in making the an-
nouncement, stated that the Cha-
pel is to be modeled after the
voluntary chapels that are held
during examinations. It will last
approximately ten minutes.

Dickie Davis, who is in charge
of the regular Y.M.C.A. chapel
programing, -will also be in charge
of this voluntary service.

The members of the faculty and
the student body are cordially in-
vited to attend.

Flim Committee Gives
Statement Of Purpose

It is the desire of the College
Union Film Committee to bring a
consistently high grade of motion
pittures to the campus. With this
in mind, we have set out to book
films that would not ordinarily be
shown in the commercial theatre.
As a consequence, many of our at-
tractions have not been very well
known, in that they may be sev-
eral years old, of foreign origin,
or were not big money makers. .

Therefore it is necessary for us
to develop a reputation for run-
ning pictures of such calibre that
one would not have to be familiar
with our films at all to be assured
of their quality. For the most part
we believe we are fulfilling this
ambition, although we realize that
a few movies of dubious merit
have crept in. The present semes-
ter is not entirely free from them.
In order to close these gaps and to
render the best service possible,
we would greatly appreciate sug-
gestions from the faculty as well
as from the students concerning
future bookings.

Eu Literary Sociely
Holds First Session

Despite a few minor mishaps,
the Eumanean Literary Society
got its season off to a gocd start
Monday night at Eu Hall. Tim
Cooper, the new prexy, presided
over the zealous throng.

After a short business session
devoted to keys, quorums, and
such, Maurice Crouse, the program
chairman, presented a highly en-
tertaining and worthwhile pro-
gram which thoroughly tested the
participants’ knowledge of litera-
ture.

It was announced that a diverse
and interesting variety of forums,
debates, and guest speakers have
been scheduled for the semester.
Eu members interested in main-
taining their status were urged
to be on hand for the bi-monthly
gatherings, held the first and third
Monday nights in each month.

OGDEN NASH, COMIC
POET, HERE OCT. 29

By DUNBAR OGDEN

The poetic comic genius who
“trips the light fantastic through
the Saturday Evening Post and the
New Yorker, Ogden Nash, will ap-
pear on the Davidson stage Friday
night, October 29, at 8:15. His
most recent book of verse, “The
Private Dining Room, was hailed
enthusiastically by the critics and
added to the expanding group of
his admirers.

Except for a brief tenure as
managing editor of the New Yorker
in 1931, Mr. Nash has concentrat-
ed for some twenty years on pro-
ducing the light verses that have
become associated with his name.
His book, Hard Lines, published in
1931, established his as a master
of humorous verse, and I'm A
Stranger Here Myself, published
five years later, sold more than
100,000 copies in the original edi-
tion.

Ogden Nash was born in Rye,
New York, the first of his family
to emerge north of the Mason-
Dixon Line. One of his ancestors
was Revolutiohary governor of this
fair state, another, a Revolutionary
general; Francis Nash gave his
name to Nashville, Tennessee.

Several well-known Davidson

and ministers attending the Pres-
byterian Men's Convention at New
Orleans on Oct. 16, 17, and 18.

The meeting, which is sponsored
every five years by the Presby-
terian Church, U. S., had its pro-
gram centered on the subject of
“Christian Faith”. Some of the
country’s most outstanding Chris-
tian leaders, including evangelist
Billy Graham, Gov. Theodore Mc-
Keldin of Maryland, and Dr. Lewis
H. Evans, spoke to the group on
the various applications of faith
to present-day living.

UNION TO PRESENT
"JOHNNY O'CLOCK”

“Johnny O'Clock,” a detective
story starring Dick Powell, Evelyn
Keyes, Lee Cobb, and Ellen Drew,
will be Saturday night's film of-
fering by the College Union. The
picture will begin at 9 o'clock, and

are invited to make suggestions for
future films. Anyone wishing to
ask for a film should contact any
member of the College Union Film
Committee.

Guidance Program
Available For All

The vocational guidance pro-
gram at Davidson, conducted by
Professor Jay Ostwalt, is an exten-
sive and well planned testing pro-
gram. Through this program a stu-
dent may get expert help in re-

‘| gard to selecting a vocation.

A student wishing to receive
help in this line may do so, free
of any cost, by merely going to
the Vocational Guidance Office,
which is room 231, north end of
Chambers, and applying for an in-
terview. When a student is given
an interview, he talks over the
problem which he has with Pro-
fessor Ostwalt, and from this a
plan of testing is worked out.

At this time he is given certain
basic tests to determine in what
general fields he is interested and
what his basic abilities are. Then
he is given a series of highly spe-
cialized tests to determine in ex-
actly what field or fields he is
qualified.

There are two kinds of these
tests. One type may be taken in a
student’s own room, but the other
formal tests are given in the gui-
dance office under the supervision
of Professor Ostwalt or his staff.
Upon completion of these tests he
is given a second interview.

Professor Ostwalt goes over all
the tests with the student, point-
ing out what fields he is best quali-
fied to enter. Besides this voca-
tional guidance program of tests
there is another type, which is a
series of ability tests to analyze
academic problems. These enable
a student to find where his basic
faults lie in his academic work and
provide a way for him to correct

COURT OF CONTROL
DECIDES 10 ABOLISH
FRIDAY MEETINGS

Harry Petersen, chief judge of
the Court of Control, announced
this week the decision of the Court
to abolish its Friday morning meet-
ings in assembly.

The move came as a result of
observation by judges and mem-
bers of the student body that the
Court was losing its, effectiveness
on account of conduct during the
meetings. Freshmen called before
the assembly and seryed with sub-
poenas to meet trial the following
week frequently met jeers and cat-
calls from other members of the
student body.

In ‘the opinion of Court mem-
bers, this type of behaviour tends
to undermine the true purpose of
the Court and to give freshmen an
impression that the Court was
just ‘a big joke.”

In an effort to restore the ef-
fectiveness of the Court procedure
and to eliminate undue belittle-
ment of freshmen, the Court has
changed its method of issuing sub-
doenas. Accused freshmen are now
notified by mail to appear before
che Court. for trial. .

Petersen emphasized that the
Court of’ Control is definitely not
a vehicle of the student body de-
signed to belittle or harass fresh-
men. He pointed out the bene-
ficial results in freshman attitude
that have come as a result of the
Court's work this year.

Open meetings before the entire
student body have not always been
a part of the Court procedure. The
Court installed this method of sum-
moning freshmen before assembly
in 1949.

The Court will continue to hold

mecting with freshmen occasional-

frequent hatchecks following cha-
pel. In addition, Petersen has been

ly in their Wednesday morning as-
semblies in the Union.

Few Rooms Available
For H.C. Dance Dates

With Homecoming only a week
off, only a few rooms for girls are
left. Duke and East dormitories
and the infirmary have all been
filled. The Douglas house on Con-
cord Road, formerly the home of
Professor W. I. Wilson, has been
opened for girls and is now nearly
full.

One of the reasons for this
crowding is the great number of
graduates of last year who have
arranged for places for their dates.

Mrs. Little wishes to make it
clear that boys who do not need
rooms should not reserve them. In
the face of the current shortage,
anyone who has reserved a room
and finds he cannot use it should
report immediately to Mrs. Little.
Her office is 101 Watts dormitory.

COLLEGE PROBLEMS

Columbus, 0. — (1.P.) — College
entrance offers just as many prob-
lems to potentially superior stu-
dents as to those tess well equip-
ped for college work. This was re-
vealed in an Ohio State University
research project which diselosed
also that “how to study” was the
problem most frequently mention-
ed by a group of education fresh-
men. The research was aimed at
selecting a group of potentially
superior students and predicting
their ultimate success in the Uni
versity.

The researchers, Dr. Collins W.
Burnett, coordinator of student
personnel in the College of Educa-
tion and Patricia S. MacLachlin,
a former graduate student in psy-
chology, found that:

The potentially superior were

... younger upon entrance. to col-
lege; they have higher grades and
participate more extensively in ex-
tracurricular and leisure time ae-
tivities; their fathers are grouped
mainly in the professional and ma-
hagerial categories; they tend to
underestimate their ability to
make high grades: and they ap-
parently have as wide a range of
problems as do the non-potentially
superior students.

The researchers said that deter-
mining who are superior college
freshmen involves definition, selec-
tion and careful study. “If promis-
ing college studer.ts are to develop
to the optimum of their capabili-
ties,” they said, “they must be
recognized, stimulated, and guided
from the beginning of their col-
lege careers.”

study, carrying a promise of fi-
nancial aid within prescribed con-
ditions as there may be need. The
maximum annual grant for single
