Changes on Patterson Court

Terry, CCRL finalize alcohol policy

By Jay Jennings

Davidson has a revised alco-
hol policy for Patterson Court for
the ’93-’94 school year based on
the recommendations of the Coun-
cil on Campus and Religious Life
and the Dean of Students. This
policy, approved by President
Kuykendall and the Trustees, will
shift responsibility from the alco-
hol monitors to the houses of
Patterson Court.

This year there will be two
sober monitors from the host orga-
nization, one for each additional
sponsor, a risk manager, and a po-
lice officer. According to Kurt
Holmes, Patterson Court Adviser,
the sober monitors are the “first
line of defense” and will hopefully
fix any problems that arise at par-
ties. If the sober monitors do not:
attempt to correct the problems,
the risk manager will tell the sober
monitor to do so. Risk managers
willissue citations if their requests
are ignored.

Holmes said the revised policy
will not encourage random checks
of I.D.’s, but will deal with “those
who are disruptive or bring undo
attention to themselves.” This isa
big change from the job of the
alcohol monitors, which seemed
to be the only alcohol enforce-
ment.

Violations of the policy by the
houses will go to a new judical part

of the Patterson Court Committee
rather than the Alcohol Enforce-
ment Committee (AEC). Indi-
vidual citations will still go the
AEC. The Dean of Students, Will
Terry, feels that it was a “big mis-
take” to take away enforcement
from the houses and the PCC and
wanted to return the enforcement
this year.

The revised policy allows for
two weekday parties each week.
This will provide the opportunity
for parties from the houses with
the resources and desire to have
parties. The actual number of par-
ties will not increase significantly,
but will be more evenly distrib-
uted. Parties co-sponsored with
the Union will not count for the
number of parties each week. Dean
Terry hopes this will encourage
the Union and PCC to work to-
gether on many events this year.

The policy stipulates the rules
for BYOB parties, which did not
have any rules in the past. There
will be a limit on the amount of
alcohol that can be brought to the
party and it must be taken to a
designed serving area.

Last Spring, the PCC, SGA,
Dean of Students, the Student
Health and Other Concerns, and
the Campus Police were asked to
submit suggestions for a revised
policy. The CCRL and William
Brown, head of the Union, Dean

Terry, and Kurt Holmes rewrote
the policy considering the sugges-
tions around April 15. The CCRL
gave the revised policy to Presi-
dent Kuykendall, who approved
the plan soon after.

The SGA wanted the revised
policy to allow 21 year olds to
bring two cups from the basement

atatime. The PCCand Dean Terry *

realized this could not be justified
and would not be passed by Presi-
dent Kuykendall and the Trustees.
Dean Terry wanted to emphasize
the effectiveness of the PCC’s rec-
ommendations. Almost all of
their suggestions were accepted.

Both Dean Terry and Kurt
Holmeshope that the revised policy
will make the court setting more
relaxed and reduce confrontations
between students and the authori-
ties.

SAE returns to court after suspension

By Katherine Hash

Davidson’s chapter of the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity has
returned to their former house on
Patterson Court after a one year
suspension. The Council on Cam-
pus and Religious Life accepted
SAE’s petition for readmission last
spring.

of Students and chair of the CCRL,

the end it was the

SAE’s return to the court depended
on their completion of the CCRL’s
recommendations to update by-
laws, revise their pledge program,
and create an Alumni Advisory
Board. SAE submitted these revi-
sions to President Kuykendall in
early August. Kuykendall then
finalized the decisionto allow SAE
back on campus.

. .SAEwasplacedonsocialpro- _-

bation due to a “series of unfortu-
nate incidents” in 1991-92, accord-
ing to Dean Terry. Their subse-
quent sponsoring of a prohibited
pledge activity resulted in their
suspension from the court. For the
”92-’93 school year, the fraternity
was restricted from sponsoring
social activities on campus, con-
ducting formal rush, issuing bids,
and running a pledge program.

Dean Terry. recognized the
importance of making SAE’s re-
turn to the court “as viable as pos-
sible as soon as possible.” Juniors
who had been pledging when the
fraternity was suspended were fi-
nally initiated last Tuesday night.
Sophomores who had opted to wait
for SAE rather than select another
house will be initiated this fall af-
ter a mini-pledge program. SAE
will conduct formal rush for fresh-
men along with the other fraterni-
ties this spring.

Edwin Thomas, SAE presi-
dent, hopes the new pledge pro-
gram willhelpSAE “return tosome
of the ideals such as friendship,
tolerance, and maturity which the

fraternity is supposed to operate
and to find new ways of building
group cohesiveness not built on
embarrassment or hazing. The
eight week pledge period culmi-
nates in a pledge retreat/camping
trip. Kurt Holmes, Patterson Court
Advisor, hopes the program will
“serve as a model for the other
houses on the court.”

According to Dean Terry, the deci-
sion to allow SAE to retain their
house was made at the time of their
suspension.

Connor President Julie Petty
says Connor, who occupied the
house last year, was glad that SAE
was allowed to move back into the
house “which is important to them
as a physical place.” Connor is
happy to be settling into a perma-
nent house of their own at No. 4
Patterson Court, the former Spen-
cer House.

According to Thomas, SAE is
very excited to be back and is look-
ing forward to a new beginning
marked by active involvement in
the community. The SAE’s spon-
sored the first court party of the
year last Tuesday night. They also
hosted the first Patterson Court
Council meeting Sunday, August
