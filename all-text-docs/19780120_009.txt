According to Coordinator of
International Study Tony
Boon, international students
are a “resource that has not
been tapped fully.’’ He went
on to add that ‘‘they have a lot
to offer and they want to share
it with Davidson students.”

Currently Boon is interested
in making the international
student's stay at Davidson

ingful.”’

His number one priority at
the moment is to provide
“accurate information at the
earliest possible time to those
foreign students who express
an interest in Davidson,”’ sta-
ted Boon.

Right now foreign students
come to Davidson in a variety
of different ways. In the past,
according to a report by

“more rewarding and mean-.

Foreign Advisor Louise

Thompson, ‘Students were re-

cruited from the Institute of
International Education and
from personal contacts.’’ The
report goes on to state that
“Today’s recruitment is very
different,’’ and that it “‘some-
how lacks the personal touch.”’
At the present time, students
are selected by their respective
schools or Davidson contacts
with the local office having no
voice in the selection proce-
dure.

Boon admits that students
from France and Germany
“have the edge’ in knowing
what to expect from Davidson
students and professors at
their own universities.

Students from Spain, India,
Egypt, and Japan however do
not have this opportunity.
Therefore Boon feels that it is
necessary. ‘‘to take the impe-
tus early in the adademic year
towards recruiting interna-

tional students,”
This will not be an-easy task
however. Since the original
. funding for the program ,pro-
vided by Mr. Smith Richard-
son was withdrawn in 1971,
the program has been opera-
ting under limited funding.

Brochures on Davidson pro-
vided for are no longer sent
out to the prospective stu-
dents and cuts are being made
in every possible area. Fur-
thermore, the students are not
able to earn enough money
here on campus to allow them
to travel to other regions of
The United States.

Boon 1s also working on
ways to involve international
students more in the life of the
college.

When the program first
began in 1958 the students
were assigned to fraternities.
According to Thompson’s re-
port, ‘‘Each fraternity ‘chose’

one of the students and his

board was paid by the group.
In this way he became a
member of an intimate group,
had friends' interested in him,
and had a_means_ of
transportation. ’

Boon’s plans include insti-
tuting a better orientation,
perhaps combining parts of it
with freshman orientation,
giving the students a chance
to eat at one of the eating
houses for a term, stimulating
student interest in rooming
with an international student,
especially in off-campus hou-
sing, and designing more so-
cial/cultural events allowing a
better integration of Davidson
and foreign students.

According to Boon, David-
son students need to take
more ‘‘initiative’’ in devel-
oping relationships with inter-
national students. He feels
that ‘‘their presence here will
enrich the lives of other Da-

vidson students.”

Students voice expectations and experiences

By MARYELLEN SAWADA
Staff Writer
Looking for a year of travel,
experience, change, or even acade-

mics, eleven international students:

made their way to Davidson College.
There is quite a diversity of opinion
among the nine remaining interna-
tional students about their expecta-
tions of Davidson and their actual
‘Davidson experience.”’

Having known Davidson students
at Montpellier, French exchange stu-
dent Patricia Henrion said, ‘‘David-
son is exactly as I expected....I enjoy
Davidson because I have become a
Davidson student. If I come here and
say ‘I am French and I don’t like this
and I don’t like that,’ I have missed

something. You cannot compare...
things are very different.”’
Commenting on the size of David-
son, Henrion explained, “If 1 come
from a large college, of course

Tomita said, ‘One of the reasons I
came was not particularly to study at
Davidson; I wanted experience, so I
was open-minded about Davidson.”’

Still, Tomita was ‘‘surprised at how

‘It was the right decision, but | am not

enjoying myself...Students are not as open

to different perspectives as | thought.’

“There is an old saying: when in
Rome, do as the Romans," he said.
For éxample, it is an American
college tradition to have ‘close living’
inthe dormatories. Granted, foreign
students are not used to our dorm life,
ds they live mainly in singles at their
home university. But, dorm life is a
part of their learning process, too.”

“They must make an effort to

so many ways to be involved.”’

Youssef Abagui, of Egypt, attri-
butes this involvement in the campus
. to his “marvglous. year." ;Abagui has:
been involved in the language depart-
ment (he has taught four students to
speak and to write in Arabic),
WDAYV, and several publications. He

has been pleased with student en-
couragement of the Sadat trip sup-

port letter and his amount of friends

on campus.

Abagui sees the international prog-
ram as ‘good for Davidson but not
good for the international student.”
He questioned, ‘‘Who represents the

~ . international student? We need some-

one intelligent, gregarious...someone
who knows what college is about and
above all, has interest.’

“There was no genuine interest --
rapport-- from the international office
until Bernadette (B. Flaton, Mexico)
and Omaima (O. Hatem, Egypt)
left.”

Abagui is, however, optimistic
about the rest ot his stay here
because, as he said, ‘I genuinely love
Davidson.”

Many of the students in the
program received little correspon-
dence about Davidson and so knew
almost nothing about the school. One
of these students was Koji Tomita of
Japan. ~ 2

Joerg Hinemann of Germany said, *'!

Vijay Verghese of India. Verghese,
who has already studied and received
his degree in India hopes to continue
those studies-at-another school in the
United States.

Verghese is critical of the pace of t
study of the Davidson classes. “There
is no time time to assimilate the
material...”

A four year student from Hong
Kong, Fai Wong finds little to
complain about academically even
though ‘I am required to take the
exams and the others don’t have to.”

In a meeting of international stu-
dents and administrators, Ignacio
Lopez of Spain spoke of his “‘prob-
lems with the conception of the
institution.” Lopez is able to view
Davidson from his role as a student
and that of a tutor, to other students.

“Jobs of some sort have become
almost a necessity for the internation-
al student. All in need of jobs are now
working for the language department,
ARA, or the library.

Like, Lopez, Solange Albet of
France is a language teacher/tutor.
She finds the work “very hard..,very

thought.”’

Hinemann also has been displeased
with the academics at Davidson, ‘‘I

expected to be more independent in
my independent studies...1 was in

introductory course~ I didn’t care for
that.”’

Another student frustrated with
the enrollmentastat< thet has forced

extra money by babysitting.

Not being able to be a part of the
eating houses has been a social
problem for many of the students
wanting to become better acquainted
with upper class persons. “‘I seem to
be the only one who was able to join
an eating club,’’ said Rory Cornish of
England..'‘And I rather like jit,”’
