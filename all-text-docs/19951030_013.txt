Cats lose another heartbreaker

Despite a Gisareeee bout with Hampden-Sydney, Cats continue to build

“They’re 1-7, but they’re not
losers,” Davidson coach Tim
Landis said after his Wildcats’ 22-
19 heart-wrenching Parents’
Weekend loss to Hampton-Sydney
on Saturday.

FOOTBALL

A late fourth quarter Dunn
Mileham field goal attempt that
caromed off the upright and a Clif
Henry interception with just over a
minute remaining denied the Wild-
cats at least a tie.

After a close first half which
ended with Hampton-Sydney
clinging to a 14-13 lead, both de-
fenses buckled down in the second

stanza, eachallowing atouchdown. ~

Butin the end, it was again the
Wildcats who hung their heads af-
ter another missed opportunity to
end their losing streak that now
stands at seven games.

Davidson again bettered its
opponent in most important statis-
tical categories except score, in-
cluding time of possession, pass-
ing yards and total yards. And de-
spite the discouraging record, the
Wildcats have earned the respect
of opponents and spectators alike.

James Cassidy (10 tackles and
a sack on Saturday) continued to
play like an All-American. The
senior has set a Davidson single-
‘season sack mark with nine and, in
doing so, has shattered the school’s
career record with 21.5.

Brandon Clarke

Bartholemew (seven), Keith Davis
and Adam Gess have instilled a
winning attitude into the younger
players that should pay dividends
for the program in the future.

“T wantto have noregrets when
Ileave Davidson College,” Cassidy
said. “If there’s one thing we can
give (the underclassmen), if it’s
not a winning season, we can show
them what it takes to win.”

And the younger players have
taken note. Shreve Ariail, Dan
Dearing, Marcus Williams, Kevin

Graham, and Ben Spivey, all un-
derclassmen, have become impor-
tant cogs in the defense.

“Our players work so hard,”
said freshman wideout Mike
Harrington, who posted a team-
high five catches for 49 yards.

“We play because we love the
game of football,” added freshman
Henry, an all-state quarterback in
Georgia last year who played tre-
mendously Saturday in his first
college start.

Unfortunately, many will re-

member the late interception he
threw that essentially iced the Ti-

gers victory, but he also registered -

the squad’s season-best passing
output with 212 yards on 22
completions.

Henry connected with nine dif-
ferent receivers and provided an
additional rushing option at quar-
terback. With his performance,
Henry will start next Saturday when
Davidson visits Centre College
(Ky.). Davidson winds up the sea-
son the following Saturday at home

against Bridgewater.

Lorenzo Moll (61 yards and a
26-yard touchdown run), Mike
Warrick (40 yards at fullback slot
and a 2-yard scoring dive) and
Bryan Kern (28 yards four carries)
anchored the rushing attack.

“Things will come together,”
Landis said. “It doesn’t happen
overnight. You build it over time,
and this will pay off.”

Said Henry: “We’ve got two.
games: left, and we’re going to win
them.”

Freshmen show strength in opening meet

The course of events mostly
followed the anticipated road Sat-
urday in the men’s and women’s
swimming and diving meet against
Virginia Tech, the teams’ season
openers.

SWIMMING & DIVING

Coaches expected and re-
ceived strong individual perfor-
mances, but weren’t banking on a
victory at Baker’s Cannon pool.

“Everyone has been working
very hard, and, after a long period
of training, many athletes are go-
ing to see the fruits of their labors
and turn in fine performances,”
Assistant Coach Sam Jalet said.

With a strong freshman class
and most of the core group of top
performers returning from last year,
this season should be better than
last year’s.

Jalet said the women’s squad
should improve on. last year’s

Championships to second or third,
and the men’s team should suc-
cessfully defend its title.

In the opener Saturday, after

seven weeks of practice, the men’s

team lost by 14 points, while the
women’s team also fell.

“We had. a really good train-
ing base, and there was definitely a
little extra nervous tensions since
this was the first meet,” said

women’s team captain Ratharine
Welling.

picked up his first college win in
the 100 breaststroke. Mike McCabe
and Jason Prince both had several
close finishes as well as being part
of the winning medley relay team
with Freddy Schnell and Corey
Bean.

Upperclassmen provided
some excitement as well. Kelly
Bolterstein came from behind to
win the 100 freestyle and also won
the 50. On the men’s side, Churchill
Hooff won two races — the 1000
freestyle and the 500 freestyle.

Virginia Tech evidently came
to Davidson confident of a victory.
Midway through the meet, though,
the Hokies had to rethink their
strategy.

“They weren’t expecting us to
be as good as we were, and, in the
middle of the meet, they had to
change their line-up to put some of
their better swimmers in key posi-
tions to insure that they went away
with the victory,” said Rosenquest.

“Even though we lost, it was
good experience,” Schnell said.
“We still had a productive meet
