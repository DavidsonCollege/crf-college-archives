Without Really Trying

For years representatives in the
enliege's student government have
acted as if they were bound by noth-
Ing—be it regulations, custom or even
pood faith—to attend meetings.

A fraternity basketball game, a re
view to study for, a trip. a date—just
about anything has constituted an ex-
cuse {o avoid doing what they were
elected fo do: represent us.

Last year, for example, Student
Council members displaved a disgust-.
ing varelessnese shout their responsi-.
bilities. An atfondance check ai mid-
vear revealed that six out of 17 had
already overeut and faur more were
near the limit. The bes! records in
the place belonged to the praaident,
two sophomores and the DAVIDSON-
IAN reporter covering the meetings.

The new Senate elected last spring
—despite new trappings and new po-
tentinl—was worse, It had important
jobs to du—tike ralification of bylaws
to the new student bady canstitution
—yet twice in a single week President
Joe Murphy was unable to muster a
quorum.

In faci, Murphy fs now saying he
may be forced to go ahead with a
meeting despite the lack of a quorum.

it seems more than a little ironic
that a student body that wants more
say-so in college affairs shoutd be re-
duced to the point where its own gov-
erning beady might be convened with-
out benefit of a quorum. Of course,
most student governments lack power
and influence, but Davidson’s lacks
ont thing more; the respect of the
student body.

It s not surprising. In fact, sbout
the only thing strange about the whole
set-up is the fact that the do-nothings
who have the nerve—the unmitigated

cy

Red-Necking

North Carolinians flustered over the
current gubernatorial contest might
find a measure of comfort in a recent
statement by Democratic candidate
Bob Scott.

Boldly venturing cut on a political
limb a couple of weeks back, candi-
date Scott sotemnly pledged thot, if
elected, be would not be a 'milnqne-
toast governor.”

Sald he: “1 will net be a miquetcaat
governor, I will call on you for your
support because by working together
we ean bring new life and energy into
North Carolina.” .

Reaseuring as that may be to a few.
however, it changus very litte, For
Bob Seott may be a lot of things. but
timid he is not, If that wasn"! made
clear lost spring when he came aut
four-square behind paved drive ways
for volunteer fire departments, it
should have been obvious from his
courageous statement that al! students
who boycott classes should be booted
cut of school.

Or again, what about his daring—
albeit unsobstantiated —— “exposure”

One of those seniors just back from
a year abroad, his eyes bleary but
open afier 10 months on the Canti-

men the ather day and annaunced to

Sexy Survey

A psychologist’s study of thal pura-
gon of enlightenment and edification
—the college classroom Jecture—has
yeveoled the not-so-startling news that
most students do not even listen to it.

In fact, at least as many students
(20 percent) are thinking about sex as
are listening to the lecture, Paul
Cameron of Wayne State Univers!
told a psychological association meel-
ing in San Francisco ‘recently.

The rest of the students, Cameron
said, are reminiscing or g of
other matters. ;

Cameron based his report on a nine-
week course in introductory psycholo-
gy for 85 college sophomores. A gun
was fired at random during the course,
and the students reported what the
were thinking about at the momant.

‘What we are to conclude irom all
this we are not quite certaln. it is
either an interesting commentary on
the state of mind of the nation’s youth
or on the state of the nation's lectures.

he knows how to get himself elected,
and: much as we hate to admit if, he
just may be right.

Even more discouraging is the fact
(iat there is no alternative to the man.
For his apposent, Jim Gardner, is
worse, If that's possible.

So Scott may as well save his breath
the next time he intends to deny his
timidity. Instead, he could be reas-
suring a jot of us that ff he's elected
he'll abandon his allisnce with the
tednecks. Otherwise, us far as we're
concerned, he might just as well keep
his mouth shut for the rest of the cam-
paign,

lt is this “whole man" hang-up. in

nificantly to the problem of wide-
spread student apathy here. For it is
no wonder that many freshmen tnke
a loole at the dozens af preskdents, cn-
captains and other BMOC's in their
class and for all practical purposes
give up, resigning thamselves io the
raie af fellawer rather than leader.

Meanwhile. many organizations and
areas of interest at Davidson are ery-
