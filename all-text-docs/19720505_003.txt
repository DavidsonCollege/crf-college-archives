Bruce Selected As 1972-73
Assistant To The President

By ALAN FORD
Staff Writer

Davidson College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. an-
nounced Tuesday morning the
selection of Duff Bruce as the
new Assistant to the President.

When asked why he had chos-
en Bruce, Spencer replied that
“jit wasn’t the kind of choice
that I enjoy making.” He said
that he felt all of the candi-
dates were well qualified and
would have done a good job.
He did feel however, that Bruce
was the best qualified of the
candidates.

According .o Greg Scott, the
current Assistant to the Presi-
dent, the job carries several re-
sponsibilities. Scott said that
the main duties of the assistant
are “handling the detail work
of the two Convocations” and
providing the main liaison be-
tween. the President and the
trustees.

Other things taken care of-by
the assistant are researching
speeches, answering mail, tak-
ing charge of unexpected visi-
tors, and writing drafts of pro-

Faculty

under the auspices of the Office
of International Education.

Thomas has been a Research
Scholar for the University
Grants Commission of India
and Curator of the National Art
Gallery in Madras.

Thomas will be at Davidson
for the fall term and at Guil-
ford College after January.

Professor William R. Nutt,
now teaching chemistry at Da-
vidson, loses his temporary sta-
tus and is being hired on a per-
manent basis. Nutt, a graduate
of Ohio Wesleyan and Duke, i
an Assistant Professor of Phys-
ical Chemistry.

These new faculty members

are needed to fill the places left

by 1etiring Professors James
Causey, John Gallent and James
Reid.

... Tenure Evaluation System Needed

(Continued From Page 1)
to the tenure problem, what
can be done to improve faculty
evaluation at Davidson?

The tendency of collective bar-
gaining to divide the college
community into belligerent
camps of faculty and adminis-
tration probably make it unsuit-
able for Davidson.

Faculty opposition to a sys-
tem of five year contracts prob-
ably precludes the development
of such a process here, too.

Most suitable to Davidson, it
seems, is Harvard's All-Univer-
sity Committee. But the success
of any new system of faculty
evaluation rests upon several
important factors.

First, the faculty must accept
organized and stringent evalua-
tion as a mecessary part of the
college’s development. Profes-
sors must be ‘“‘willing to let oth-
er people see their mistakes,”
in the words of Philosophy Pro-
fessor Earl MacCormac.

With this willingness to be
evaluated should come the re-
sponsibility for evaluation. Be-
cause they are best suited to
judge their colleagues, profes-
sors must bear the onus of eval-
uation.

According to MacCormac, the
success of a new system de-
pends upon the Administration's
ability to ‘‘get the faculty to
do it.”

The administration needs to
give up its stranglehold on the
evaluation process and open it
not only to faculty but also to
students.

Although students cannot have
an absolute voice in who is an
effective teaher, student opinion
is an important part of faculty
appraisal.

Only students attend a pro-
fessor’s class regularly, amd at
Davidson, where teaching is so
important, their opinion of a
professor’s ability should play a
formal part of faculty evalua-

tion.

But a university committee
dominated by faculty and con-
taining student input will not be
enough if evaluation is limited
to consideration of tenure and
contract renewal.

As German Professor -Hans-
ford Epes Jr. said, ‘‘Evaluation
should not be some point in
time but spread out, so it can
come back and help the profes-
sor.”

Faculty evaluation at David-
son should be a process of ‘‘pro-
fessional development assisted
by feedback,” im Epes’ words.

Bevan said last week that he
will propose a new evaluation
system next fall, but he declin-
ed to release any details.

If tenure and faculty evalua-
tion are to be meaningful at
Davidson, those details must
contain a major shift in empha-
sis, both in who evaluates our
faculty and in what evaluation
seeks to accomplish.

posals.

Scott also stated that, since
the assistant is a member of
the administration, most of his
contact is with other members
of the administrative staff.

Bruce agreed with Scott that
most of the assistant’s contacts
will be with other administra-
tors, but added the following
concept to the job. He stated
that ‘‘a great deal of my job is
student contact, knowing what
the students think.”

Discussing Scotts’ year as his
assistant, Spencer said, ‘‘Greg
has been a very effective assist-
ant and I am very appreciative
of what he has done.”

Scott had the following com-
ments to make about the job as
assistant and Spencer. ‘‘The job
of Assistant to the President is
a good education for someone
just out of the student body
who wants some administrative
experience before pursuing ca-
reer plans.

‘Dr. Spencer is the best boss
I have had. He has been willing
to place his confidence in me

DUFF BRUCE

without reservation and still has
shown tolerance and understand-
ing of the mistakes I have
made. He has been warm and
helpful to me, as he is to every-
one. I value this year of asso-
ciation with him,” Scott noted.

Bruce thad this final state-
ment to make about being the
Assistant to the President next
year, “I can’t say that I can
change anything, but I can say
I will definitely make him (Spen-
cer) aware of certain views.”
