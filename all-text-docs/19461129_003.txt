BOWL AND CONFERENCE TEAMS —

BREAK

Mlllinois and UCLA grabbed conference titles Saturday

and become the likely participants in the Rose Bowl

January 1 under the “closed shop” agreement reached

sarlier this week by the Big Nine and Pacific Coast
Let}

Conferences.

Illinois, one of the two Western conference

schools that voted against the tie up, snared its

first loop title since 1928 by lashing crippled
Northwestern, 20 to 0, while UCLA proved the

superior mudder in downing Southern California,

13 to 6, in a game that was played in a virtual
quagmire but which did draw 93,174 of the

curious.

While the Ilinois team moved out in front as the pro-

bable eastern participant in the daddy of all January 1

bowl extravaganzas, Michigan turned loose its fury in
crushing Ohio State, 58 to 6, and grabbing second place

in the standings.

The two groups decided on Wednesday, 18th
to send a representative each, preferably their

champion to Pasadena January 1 for the next

five years. The formality of a conference vote is

all that it needed to make it official in each case.

Years Day berths on the final big Saturday of the 1946

campaign.

Georgia and Georgia Tech, each a candidate
for an invitation and each a contender for the

Southeastern circuit flag, loafed to easy victories

over minor league opposition in preparation

for their own meeting next week. Georgia smear-
ed Chatanooga, 48 to 27 with losers getting 20
points in the final quarter. Georgia Tech master-
ed Furman, 41-7. Mississippi State, another bowl
prospect, also kept in the headlines by downing
Ole Miss, 20 to 0, primarily on the work of Tom
(Shorty) McWilliams, ex-Army star.

Tennessee however, had its difficulties but pulled itself
together for a 7 to 0 decision over Kentucky that insured
Coach Robert Neyland’s eleven of January 1 considera-

tion.

In the Southern conference, another breeding
ground for bowl teams, North Carolina loosed
the famed Charlie Justice for 15 points in the

final period to defeat Duke 22-7. The win. meant

the Southern Conference Title for Carl Snavely’s

eleven.

Penn State, one of the few eastern teams in the bowl

Second Half Lively

Fireworks began to explode whén
activity was resumed in the second

into the clear after accepting Hen-

and fell on his own 48. On the first
