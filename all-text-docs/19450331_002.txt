There was quite a great deal of
excitement at Coach Spittle’s seven
o'clock phys ed yesterday
morning. It seems that a luckless
fellow student had the misfortune
to break his.neck during a rousing
game of murder ball. His last words
were: “I regret that I have but one
neck to give for my phys. ed. class.”
As they were taking away the body,

- Coach Spittle was asked if he had
a statement to make. He _ replied,

Mefoofsky

Interviewed

Percy Bysshe Mefoofsky of the
Senior Class is unique among David-
son students. Word being received
at this office of his peculiar’ claim
to fame, our wandering reporter
went to his room at 76% Rumple to
interview him. We found him deeply
engrossed in a weighty tome. Cur-
iously we glanced at the” title; it:
was Dr. M. E. Sentelle’s The Hege-
lian Dialectic and Its Relation to
Donald Duck.

Parcy peered’ at us vaguely.
“Nothing like relaxing with some
light reading,” he said. “Too true,”
we replied. “You. must get Santa-
yana’s new work, The Idealism of
Heels Buttons Fisher in Reference
to Amour, An amazing charlatan,
that Dr. Fisher.

Mr. Mefoofsky put his book up
and looked at us inquiringly. “Now,
Percy, just what is your distinction ?
It must be.unusual,” we. said, “for
Brown J. Philipson is green with
envy; Neutron Fairyqueene can't
sleep nights; and Marshall-Vernon
Upperschild hasn’t eaten now for 4
days. Everyone but us seems tos

Hershey bars sent to us by our
aunt, Hezekibah Splooch, and we
committed the faux pas of feeding
them to our pet Gila monster, Mur-
Pzatroyd, in front of Georgia. So
we've been hiding out in the loft
of the Cornelius Grand Opera
House. But things are quiet now,
and we are able to come to you and
ask—WHO ARE YOU, REALLY,
OH MAN OF MYSTERY?”

weeks,

At this blunt query, the man call-
ing himself Mefoofsky paled. His
furtive pink eyes shifted uneasily.
Then, it was as if a new idea struck
him. He lifted his head; his eyes
flashed proudly. We heard his heroic
falsetto exclaim: “I am the only
man in this college not in Omega
Diddly Klappa!” And we bowed our
head in awe.
