Abernethy Writes F our Books

The experience of Dr.
George L. Abernethy, chair-
man of the philosophy de-
partment, provides insight
into the activities of. a pro-
fessor who publishes.

Abernethy has produced
in the past seven years four
books, two of which are
scheduled for publication
in the near future. On two
of these books Abernethy
collaborated with Dr. Thom-
as A. Langford, chairman of
the department of religion
at Duke University and a
Davidson graduate (class of
*61).

Abernethy’s own books are an-
thologies. In 1959 John Knox
Press published his The Idea of
Equality. Holt, Rinehart, and
Winston will bring out Aber-
nethy's Living Wisdom from the
World’s Religions In October.

How did he go about prepar-
ing thesé books? “‘I've been (in
terested in these topics for a
number of vears.”’ says Aber-
nethy. “As I went to various
university libraries. 1 kept look
‘ing for relevant -material, Ev-
ery time I found something, I

added it-to my collection. The
collection has been going on for
more than ten years."

Abernethy’s first joint effort
with Langford, published in 1962
by Macmillan, was Philosophy
of Religion: a Book of Read-
ings. The topic is one Abernethy
has taught for 15-16 years.

“Originally, I suggested the
project to Dr. Langford, who
was a former student of mine,"
he says. “We did a great dea)
of reading in this area. We
reached a tentative outline of
what we thought should go into
a book like this. We thought
there was a real need for this
kind of book.’' Eighteen months
after the book appeared. six
competitors appeared on the
market.

“After we agreed on the con.
tents. a publisher—Macmillan—
asked us to submit it." The com-
pany had heard ofthe project
through one of its field sales-
men. The company had the out-
line reviewed by other professor-
critics, who suggested changes
and pointed out strengths.

“Then we went to work in
earnest." Since Langford was at
Duke, “it was very convenient
for us to get together. We work-
ethohe whole summer together
over at Duke.’ (Abernethy gives
most of his summers to his pub-
lishing efforts: ‘When a profes-
sor teaches 12 hours of courses.
this leaves him with little time
for supplementary work, créa-
tive or uncreative. during the
regular college year. I have
therefore’ devoted my summers
to the preparation of these ma-
terials.’’)

“We worked on each section

together.’ Perhaps two of the

seven introductory essays were
written separately, ‘“but most
were joint efforts.”

After this work, the publisher
asked three critics to make sug-
gestions. *‘Some of these we used
and some we did not: the pub
lisher left the decision up to us.

“Then we had to get permis-
sion from the copyright owners.
It was a laborious process of
letter writing. In some cases,
it was hard to find who owned
the copyright—lawyer, estate, or
distant relative.”

In addition, the owners some-

times charged fees: some fees

were high. some modest. ‘‘We
had to operate within a budget.”

R. ANTHONY S. ABBOTT EXPLAINS POINT
° First Publication Comes This Fall

The publisher sent out 600 ex
amination copies to professors.
Since publication, the book has
been used at 100 colleges and
universities and has just gone
into its second printing.

Abernethy and Langford were
approached by Prentice-Hall to
prepare for publication of its
West Coast subsidiary, Dicken-
son Publishing Company, a book
of readings in the history of phi-

losophy. The two have complet-
ed work on it, and the book will
be published in May. They are
now at work on a textbook in
the history of philosophy.

Abernethy’s published work is
vlosely bound to. his work in the
classroom. “It. grows out of my
own teaching and is concerned
with the development of materi-
als that will be of use to other
teachers."

“First let me say that I
would define ‘research’ in
the broad sense of the
word.” Thus began Dean of
the Faculty Frontis W.
Johnston in answer to ques-
tions on administration poli-
cy on faculty research.

Scholarship in any field, he
continued, “‘consists of much
more than the obvious research
and writing for publication. For
instance I would certainly in-
clude recitals, exhibits, general
reading for the updating of
courses, and so forth.”

As for a written policy on fac-
ully research there is none, but
defined by Davidson's _ sta-
ture as a small liberal arts col-
lege the role of a professor is
primarily that of teaching.

Faculty members said that
research was often limited by
time, a heavier teaching load
in some courses. committec
work, the nature of the re-
search, and/or equipment and
resources.

Commented one in particular,
“If l-were more interested in
research than ‘teaching J] would
be. at a larger jnstitution. As
it is I realize that any research
undertaking must be modest.”

That it was only a matter of
degree was stated by Dean John-
ston, “Teaching and research
are not to be considered in-
compatible. In fact they are
essentially inseparable.”

The summer months are- quite
naturally the time of year that
most faculty. members engage
in any extensive research. To
aid in this work, last year (and

FRIDAY, APRIL 16, 1965

in years past) $8500 has been
earmarked for faculty research
grants. The next school year
has $9000 budgeted for this pur-
pose.

Johnston stated that some
years more than this amount
is required and some years, less..
Ordinarily ail the funds are
used. Faculty recipients usually
average around twenty. of
course this is not the sole. source
for research funds, but only
that, which the college fur-
nishes.

Johnston also expressed doubt
as to the likelihood of expand-
ing the library for extensive use
as a. faculty research library.
Because a good such library re-
quires vast amounts of rare
books and original manuscripts
and records in addition to re-
quirements for normal expan-
sion, Davidson as a small un-
dergraduate college could not
afford to buy, house, or process
enough documents to the ex-
tent needed.

Lammers Will Present Paper
To International Limnologists

Dr. W. T. Lammers of
the Biology Department
will travel this August be-
hind the iron curtain to
Warsaw, Poland, where he
‘will present a paper at the
16th International Congress
of Limnologists. The paper
will deal with his research
in limnology, and, following
its presentation it will be
published in the Congress’
journal.

Limnology, Dr. Lammers’

specialty, is the study of submi-

croscopic particles in fresh wat-
er. It. is the fresh water ver-
sion of oceanography. or, as Dr.
Lammer's prefers, ‘“‘oceanogra
phy is the saltwater version of
limnology.””

Dr. Lammers pians to make

his trip to the Congress .a com. }

bination of business and pleas:
ure. Accompanied by his wife.
Lammers will leave on August
11 and visit England, France,
Austria, and Germany before
attending the Congress. which
starts on August 23. Lammers
will return to Davidson on Aug
ust 31.

In these countries, besides vis-
iting the usual tourist. attrac-
tions, Lammers will be able to
inspect several research centers.
In London he will visit the Kew
Garden, the most famous, (and
the best, according to Lam-
mers), botanical garden in the
world. Also he will spend a
day or two in the lake country
of England and hopefully visit:

the freshwater laboratory at be at the Congress, and many on “The Isolation of. Virus-like

Lake Windemere.

DR. W. T. LAMMERS TAKES A BREAK
Specialty Is Limnology

Particles from Natural. Water,”
and read it. at the meeting last
summer of the. Ameircan Insti-
tute of Biological Sciences in
Boulder, Colorado.

He has spent: several summers
working in the laboratories at
Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Current-
ly Lammers’ work is being spon-
sored by the National Institute
of Health.

Lammers will definitely be
taking advantage. of Lake Nor-
man's ready made laboratory in
his own research. He plans to
study how the newly construct-
ed Marshall steam plant will
change the environment of the
lake and, of course, the fresh
water particles.

Much of the equipment in his
lab at Davidson has been pur-
chased ‘by the College, but most

- of the larger, more expensive

ilems have been provided by
grants from the AEC and the

National Institute of Health.

’ This is the way it should be,"
Lammers remarked concerning
the research equipment. *'David
son does a fine job providing
nrost of the smaller equipment,
and the grants take care of the
other.’ Lammers stated that
“the real problem is finding
time to do all the research you
would Jike to do."

Shaw’s Criticism Of Christianity

Assistant Professor Anthony S.
Abbott has spent the last summer
and all the breaks during this school
year on his new book, Shaw and
Christianity, which will be published
next fall. It deals with why George
Bernard Shaw felt inclined to criti-
cize Christianity, what elements he
criticized, and to what extent he
may be called religious or anti-re-
ligious.

For his work Abbott selected cer-
tain of Shaw’s religious plays, in-
cluding Majer Barbara arid Saint
Joan. Abbott’s book both describes
Shaw’s thinking about Christianity
and discusses his use of the stage

as a platform for that thought.

Though Shaw seemed irreligious
to his contemporaries, Abbott hopes
to demonstrate that he was beneath
the surface laughing, not at reli-
gion, but at “the superficial piety
and puritanical institutions of his
time.’

Professor Abbott is quick to point
out that Shaw was not a “wild icon-
oclastic joker," and that “he was
not purely negative. He tore down
the old, and tried to rebuild the
new.”

In the book’s final chapter, “Shaw
and Christianity: a Contemporary
Perspective,’’ Abbott looks at Shaw's
criticism in the light of some im-
portant contemporary attitudes to-
ward Christianity, and shows how
the playwright’s work. once consid-
ered “shocking,” is closely related
to criticism being written today.

In its original form the work was
Abbott’s dissertation for his PhD at
Harvard. It was begun in the fall
of 1960, and completed in 1962. He
revised the first half last summer,
and has spent his spare time since
then polishing the text and writing
a new conclusion.

When asked about the originality
of his work, Abbott commented,
“Many of the basic ideas in the
book appear in earlier writers, but
this is the first time that anyone
has carried the subject through to
a significant conclusion.”

Abbott did not do any of his re-
search at Davidson, but when asked
about the research facilities at Da-
vidson, he commented that the li-
brary could be expanded for some
kinds of research. He did not feel

that it could get the resources for
major or original research.

He also noted that a teacher's
greatest problem was trying to write
during the school year, but also add-
ed that someone interested purely
in writing and research should not
be at a small liberal arts college.

In his own words, “I’m here be-
cause I like this kind of teaching,
but there are things of my own that
I would like to do.” If a professor
becomes involved in a major piece
of writing during the school year,
he must either sacrifice his work
with his students, or put off his
writing until vacation.

Abbott is trying to coincide the
release of his book with the open-
ing of first semester next year. He
expects some controversy within the
church over his book, but added
that today Shaw’s criticism is un-
likely to cause the kind of shock it
did when it was first written.

Abbott said that it was difficult
to look beyond completion of this
present work until it was finished,
but that he hoped to complete some
articles on American literature.
