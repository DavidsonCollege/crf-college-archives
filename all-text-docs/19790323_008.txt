the first CROP walk in the
history of Davidson.

At least two hundred stu-
dents will be walking, including
ninety or more freshmen. Some
Professors, senior high’ school

church youth group members —

and other various community
people will also take part in this

walk. Some people plan to run.

the route. .

Each person who is walking is
to get as many sponsors as
possible to pledge money for
each mile walked. Registration
begins and the walkers will take
off down the road as a group at
10:00 a.m. -

Walkers are urged to bring
water, food, signs or anything
to keep life interesting. Albert
Connette is going to push a
brass bed. William Brown’s boy
scout troop will lead the group
in song.

No monetary goal has been
set by the organizers. ‘‘We’re
essentially interested in having
people walk because they really
want to walk,’’ said John
Tucker, one of the organizers.

Other organizers include Merle
Miller, Sue Dehoney, and Mike

- McGrady. See them if you'd

like to walk.

A CROP symposium on
world hunger ‘will then be held
on Sunday, March 25th, in the
900 Room from 7:00 until 8:30
or 9:00. Dr. Paul R. McCleary,
the. Executive Director of

Church World Service (CROP is

the fund raiser for this service ),
will be the main speaker.

Also speaking will be Terence
Martin, the Trade and Develop-
ment issues analyst for Bread
for the World (a hunger lobby-
ing group in Washington and
New York) and Dr. Paul S.

’ Crane, former medical mission-

ary to Korea.

Everyone is invited to attend
will clarify what the Church
World Service does and where
the money goes that CROP
raises.

Tucher sees the goals of
CROP as two-fold: ‘‘to encour-
age an awareness of world hun-
ger and to promote a feeling of
community.’”’ The walk and
symposium promise to attend
to both needs.

Don’t: forget that there is a
CROP lunch every Tuesday,
12:30-1:30. Lunch costs 75
cents, and everyone is welcome.
Come and bring a friend.

NC-PIRG releases comparative drug price survey results

By GEOF LITTLE
Staff Writer

In an effort to gain support
for legislation now pending in
the state legislature, the David-
son chapter of NC-PIRG held a
press conference early last week
to release results of its survey

«into the comparative prices of

brand name and generic drugs.
The survey was part of a co-
ordinated effort by PIRGs ac-

‘ross the state aimed at reveal-

ing the need for a Drug. Substi-
tution Law. By using a simple
methodology involving tele-
phoned requests for prices on

-six different drugs, Davidson-

PIRG found price differences

‘ between brand name and gener-
ic drugs to be as high as 60 per-

cent.
At present North Carolina

law prohibits a pharmicist from:

substituting a cheaper, but
therapeutically equivalent, ge-
neric drug for a more expensive
brand name drug if the doctor
has used the brand name on the
prescription. The proposed Ge-
neric.Drug Substitution Law
would allow a pharmicist, at the
patient’s request, to make such
a substitution. To date 40
states have passed similar legis-
lation.

The PIRG survey was coordi-

‘nated. by Marie Patterson and

carried out by six Davidson
students. Each student was
given the name of one of three
brand name drugs or one of
three equivalent generic drugs.
Each participating PIRG
student was then supposed to
call and request prices for his

particular drug at 12 Charlotte
or North..Mecklenberg drug
stores. By means of this simple
method, the PIRG members
hoped to gain not a comparison
of prices at different stores, but
an average percentile difference
between the price of each brand
name drug and its equivalent.
