Triumph Over Generals

Page Four

Home From The Tourney

Davidson’s Wildcats, playing their first time in the big Raleigh
tournament, didn’t win it, but brought back plenty of honor for the
school. Beating the seeded W. & L. Generals in their first bout, they
showed class and heady teamwork as they won by a II point margin.
Against Clemson’ on Friday luck left the ‘Cats at intermission. After
holding a nice lead throughout most of the initial half, the Tigers
emson clawed up into a 1 point lead for themselves, which Je
s evened up with a foul shot just before the end of the half.

Dio
After intermission, it was all Clemson, with Davidson hardly able to get
moving at all. What helps our standing though, is that on Saturday
those rampaging Tigers licked Maryland, the pre-game favorite, and
thus the ‘Cats were beaten by the champion team.

While at Raleigh the ‘Cats made many new friends for them-
selves, and had a large body of supporters during the semi-final
setto with Clemson. The Davidson team behaved like thorough-
breds all the way until that disastrous last half against Clemson, and
really had the fans with them. Johnny Tice, now famous as “the
midget of the tournament,” would run a close race with Banks
McFadden of Clemson as the most popular player in the meet. He
received a terrific ovation as he left the court for a rest in the
W. & L. game.

Last year it was Duke that came from nowhere to take the title,
and this year Clemson, unseeded upset winner over the favorite Wake
Forest outfit, came through to cop the crown over the ten good teams.
Reports froma Wake Forest over the week-end indicate a sad and gloomy
time was hadSby the Deacons during their short visit to the tourney.
What a surprise to them to be knocked off after such a fine record
during the regular season! But Clemson was definitely on the march
as the end of the scheduled Southern Conference games approached,
and continued to set a killing pace in thestournament.

Banks’ McFadden must have really gotten an earful from the
coach when he was taken out during the first period of that Friday
game. Before leaving he was missing right and left, but the rangy
Clemson center returned to rack up a total of 14 points, of which
nine were scored after the half. After the intermission period Clem-
son had a 13 point lead and seven minutes and fifteen second had
gone by before Benny Harrison slipped one through the hoop for
Davidson's first score of the second half.

Speaking of spring sports, Coach Spearman was recently heard
to observe in regard to frosh track prospects that he had heard
there were many track stars in school, but so far hadn’t been able
to find them. Generally the warm spring days bring out every boy
in school for some form of exercise, and the varsity and freshmen
squads are usually filled to capacity, even with four different sports
running at the same time. Probably more students participate in
spring sports than at any other time of the year.

Numeral Club Gives Cup

The Numeral Club, composed

numerals in any sport, has done much toward helping Davidson sports,
especially in the yearling department.» A newly-formed project of the
well-established “D" Club, stepped out on its own feet, and
although it is still supervised by the parent organization, it is making
its own plans and programs.

One of the newest things it has done is to
announce that a loving cup will be awarded to the freshmen athlete
who has brought the most honer to his class through sports. At
present there are several men who appear to be leading candidates
for it. Dave Spencer heads the list with numerals in three sports ;
football, basketball, and wrestling, but Bell, Simonds, and Marsh are
close on his heels for the award with two sports thus far. This cup
should do much to encourage freshmen to participate in as m

Head Baseball Coach Flake Laird
has been working out his pitchers
and catchers indoors for several
weeks in preparation for the season
which will begin early in April.

Bad weather will probably keep
the flychasers indoors for several

move onto the varsity diamond in-

ers have been rehabilitating for
some time.

Clemson Beats Cats
In Semi-Final Tilt of
Conference Tourney

Davidson Cops Game With W. & L. But Loses to Tigers in
Johnny Tice and Ned Iverson
Shine as ’Cats Show Up Well

Davidson's Wildcats, having qual-
ified for the annual Southern Con-
ference tournament at Raleigh, de-
feated the highly-touted Washing-
ton and Lee Generals in their first
encountery 43-32. Clemson’s  sur-
prising Tigers turned back the ’Cats
in the semi-finals by a 49-33 count.

The locals, entering the game
with the Generals as underdogs be-
cause of the latters high standing
in Conference play, displayed su-
perb brand of ball and dazzled the
Virginians with their air-tight de-
fense and fast breaking. Davidson
started with a rush and jumped in-
to a 10-4 lead with only seven min-
utes of the fracas gone. Led by
Dobbins, lanky sophomore center
the Gens staged a comeback and
pulled up to within 4 points at the
half, the score being 20-16. The
’Cats returned to the floor for the
second half and soon ran up the
count with a whirlwind attack.
Captain Ned Iverson led this assault
with 9 points, rung up in rapid suc-
cession despite the frantic efforts of
the G’s Dobbins.

The game closed with the losers
letting fly with futile long shots
in an effort to overtake the in-
spired 'Cats. The feature of the
struggle was the going-over John-
ny Tice gave the mighty Pinck,
Sophomore flash, who has led
Washington and Lee’s attack all
season. “Little John”, displaying su-
perb footwork, held the high-scor-
ing forward, to 9 points and rack-
ed up nine himself. Iverson was
the scoring leader for both teams
with 13 points tothis credit.

Lose To Tigers

The local lads took the floor the
following night as odds-on favorites
to beat the Clemson Tigers, who
had barely eked their way into the
tournament. The 'Cats started with
a bang and took a commanding lead
on baskets by “Footsie” Cowan and
Jim Hogg. However, the Palmetto
boys came to life and fought their
way into a 24-24 half-time dead-
lock.. In the second half “Lady
Luck” forsook the Davidson quint.
