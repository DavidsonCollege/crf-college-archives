“Young Hippie Tourists” Meet
The Ugly American In Europe

By SAM McAILEY
Guest Writer

It's Wednesday and once
again I've finished three solid
days of lectured classes. I
hurry back to the apartment,
shower, sling a pack over one
shoulder, a camera over the
other, and jog down to the
station to catch an express for
Paris or Munich or Vienna or
Rome.

It doesn't matter which.
They'll be there waiting for me
regardless of where I go. But |
go anyway thinking maybe this
time things will be better or at
least different.

‘Look! Out there, way in the
middle. That's the famous
finger,’ points a_ pot-bellied
New Yorker from behind his
sun glasses.

Where?" asks his buddy's
wife.

‘Right out there in the very
center. It's that famous pointin’
finger!”

‘Yeah I see now."’

**How ‘bout that?”’

‘‘Yeaah, the famous pointin’
finger!"

So much for the Sistine
Chapel. Now on to the Vatican
Museum, the Trevi fountain,
and then the Pantheon, and
we'll have made every three-
star show in Rome. And even a
couple of two-star ones.

“If I never remember
anything else about Europe,
Harriet, I'm gonna remember
how somebody cut the tinkers
off all these statues ove here."’

And we move on. Yes ‘we’

... Missing Library Books

(Continued From Page 1)
Student Senate who has_ in-
formally investigated the
problem, reports that ‘‘ap-
proximately 250 books with the
cards still in them were found
during a search of two halls
during the spring of 1972.”

One person is reported to have
had approximately 70 illegally
removed books , in his
possession. Rabil said he
believes that the bulk of these
books were returned to the
library at the end of the school
year.

Davidson said he felt that any
student who removes a book
from the library without first
checking it out is guilty of an
honor violation whether he
returns it later or not.

“They aren't stealing, but
they won't let the system work
either,” he said.

President of the Honor Court

Dick Clay and Dean of Students
Will Terry see a solution to
the problem in peer pressure.

“Students need to become
concerned.” said Terry. “After
all, it’s in their own self. in-
terest.”

Although the Honor Court has
not vet become involved in the
issue, Clay said he hopes it will.
“Til take the matter up when
the new court meets in two
weeks.’ he said. “Individual
members could go around to
every room, state the problem,
and urge the student to return
those books they might have
taken.”

Terry said that he would
favor the granting of a grace
period during which books

could be returned without
penalty. Boxes would be
provided on campus for that
purpose.

...College Constitution

(Continued From Page 2)
certain matters and preside
over the Faculty Assembly
when the president is absent.

The constitution also provides
for ‘‘Extraordinary Petition to
Trustees"’ under which the
Faculty Assembly may directly
petition the trustees on any
matter substantially affecting
the fundamental interests of the

college.
Phillips proposed this con-
stitution after almost a year's
deliberation in the governance
committee. During this time the
committee pinpointed the
major problems of the present
governance system and iden-
tified major areas of respon-

sibility that concerned the dif-
ferent constituencies.

The next meeting of the
Governance Committee will be
held April 11 at which time the
faculty will present an alternate
model and Phillips will present
a document which will demon-
strate how his model would
relate to the current bylaws of
the Board of Trustees.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. said that copies of
the Phillips proposal have been
distributed to the faculty and
that additional copies are
available in the president's of-
fice for those students or ad-
ministrators interested in at-
taining one.

Rabil has suggested that an
ad hoc committee composed of
the Senate, Honor Court and
Library Committee members be
created to deal with the
problem: however, Clay said he
was less than enthusiastic over
the prospects of yet another
committee.

“I'm tired of all the ad hoc
committees,” he said. “Every
time there is a_ problem,
somebody forms a committee.
The Honor Court can handle
this problem.”

In addition to other solutions,
Davidson contends that the loss
could be cut by four or five per-
cent if the admissions office
would put more emphasis on
character recommendations.

It has also been suggested
that student rooms_ be
periodically searched in an ef-
fort to uncover. missing books.
Virtually all those students
questioned in an informal
DAVIDSONIAN poll indicated
strong opposition to such a
move. Most felt such a search
would constitute an invasion of
privacy.

Clay said that he would not
want the Honor Court to con-
duct such a search, and David-
son indicated that he did not for-
see such a’ measure being
necessary.

The informal poll also showed
student opposition to such
measures as closed stacks or
turnstiles. Almost all those
questioned replied that they
were aware that a problem
existed, but felt it could be
worked out. Most said that they
personally had experiences
where a book they want was
unaccountably absent from the
library.

because you see I am now one of
them. As much as I hate us, as
much as I'd rather’ be
something else I am_ un-
fortunately and unavoidably an
American tourist, a member of
the largest, loudest, most
disrespectful group of travelers
the world has ever seen.

‘‘We want to spend our money
here. but we want to know,
what we are eating,”* one yells
slowly at the proprietor so he
can for the first time understand
English. Another adds, ‘‘We
just want something good for our
money. Don't you make lasagna
like we eat at home?”

Now don't get us wrong; we
really are pretty decent people.
Why, we live just around the
corner from you. But being in
Europe is a different matter.

You got to watch these little
European bastards all the time
or they'll rip the pants off you.
It seems like they would have a
little respect, I mean after all,
our holiday trips give them a
chance to make a living, now
don’t they?

But mostly they don’t like us
and so we don't like them
either.

But we do like to run through
European countries just to see
what the different peoples are
like. It's easy to do.

Just watch their taxi drivers
and their hotel clerks, and
notice whether or not they keep
their monuments and _ johns
clean.

These are all indicators of
what the natives are generally
like. Oh, and we almost forgot
tour books. They always have a
good section called ‘‘The
People’’ that lets you un-
derstand exactly what each
society is about.

Now that you know how best
to tour Europe let us tell you
about ourselves. There are two
distinct groups of us—the young.
hippy tourists (YHT’s) and the

older establishment-type
tourists.
The latter shouldn't be

“TI think the student govern-
ment will want to become more
compact putting more students
on faculty committees to avoid
the contusion we have with so
many committees.’ said
Damewood.

The new sophomore senators,
Steve Bell, John Guthrie and
Duncan Moore, elected in Wed-
nesday’s run-off stressed im-
proved communications _ bet-
ween the student body and the
SGA as their primary goal for
the coming year.

Steve Bell, the new sophomore
class president said that he 1s
planning to publish a newsletter
every two weeks or so to keep
the students informed about
subjects being discussed in the
Senate. Bell commented, “So
many of the Senate's actions
are unknown because they are
done in committees." He added
that the student often does not

find out about these thi i
they are over. ings until

Bell stressed the fact that
there are plenty of  op-
portunities for students who
would like to work with the
SGA.

The class president said that
he will publish the names of the
professors and administration
officials who are working on the
calendar revisions. Bell hopes

allowed over here (according to
us YHT's) because they're so
shallow and close-minded, and
they just clutter up the scene.
They're bummers.

We have YHT meetings every
night in hostels and student
hotels all over Europe in which
we discuss the naive establish-
ment types, and all the other
pertinent ideas that concern
our organization like how best
to cheat the Europeans, like
what's the best museum to go to
get stoned, like who drank the
most at the October beer fest in
Munich, like how cool it is that
none of us knows what we're
doing or where we're going
next.

“I don’t know what I’m here
for, man. There's nothing to do
here really. Well, there's
nothing to do at home either. As
long as I’m already here I guess
I might as well stay.”’

We don't really get off into art
or music or history or anything,
but somebody told us Europe
was a fun place to be, so we
came. And we party for days
and have a blast playing in this
Disneyland.

We take Europe in like so
many candy bars whose wrap-
pers we leave behind to serve
the Europeans as souvenirs of
our celebration and our charac-
ter after we've finished and
gone.

I’m gone by Sunday, I leave
the tourists where I found them:
where I'll always find them.
Once back in Montpellier, I
breathe a little easier.

It's a relief to return to tiring
three hour lectures where the
tourists will never follow, to be
back with a group of easy-going
friends struggling with new
academic  and__ personal
freedoms, to be a real part of a
European community again, to
be somewhere I can duck low
when the tourists rush by on a
trans-Europe Express or thun-
der overhead on a 747.

They'll never find me here.

Issues

that this will encourage studen-
ts to express their feelings on
the issue to those who will make
the final decision.

John Guthrie, who begins his
first term as senator, cited
bringing the SGA to the studen-
ts as his primary objective for
the upcoming term. Guthrie
claims that the SGA and the
student body have been largely
detached in the past and at-
tributes this fact to an inef-
fectual Senate.

He says that when there is
better communication between
the student and the SGA. the ad-
ministration will be compelled
to accept what the Senate says.
“The Administration, it seems,
has largely dictated academic
and social’ life in the past.”
remarked Guthrie. He gave the
1973-74 calendar issue as an
example.

Duncan Moore, who served
one previous term in the Senate,
said the Senate should be much
more active than it is. “It seems
as though the students are con-
tent to let the administration
and faculty direct the life style
on our campus,” he said.

Moore said that .a much closer
knit community was necessary.
commenting that most student
voice had been lost through
apathy.
