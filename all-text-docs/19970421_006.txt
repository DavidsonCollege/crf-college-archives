Attorney General formally rejects inde-
pendent counsel for campaign financing

Attorney General Janet Reno
confirmed what many pundits
thought would happen all along re-
garding the campaign finance is-
sues and publicly stated that she
would not seek an independent
counsel to investigate electoral fund
raising practices of President
Clinotn or Congress.

But, Reno said that charges of
wrongdoing aimed at the President
and other top administration offi-
cials are not specific and credible
enough to trigger the independent
counsel law, and she dismissed sug-
gestions that she suffers a conflict
of interest in trying to investigate
the President who appointed her.

It was rumored that the Presi-
dent only let Reno keep her job for
the second term if she would not use

an independent counsel. Orrin
Hatch said, (R — Utah), “Based on
the facts and the law, (I believe)
that an independent counsel should
be appointed to handle this inves-
tigation.”

Senate Majority leader Trent
Lott (R—Miss.) called her decision
“inexcusable.” The law re-
quires the attorney general to seek
appointment of an independent
counsel when there is specific evi-
dence from a credible source of
wrongdoing by “covered individu-
als,” a category that includes the
vice president, cabinet members,
and officers of the election cam-
paign.

Reno stated that there was n
evidence of people being covered
by the statute participating in ille-

gal activities.

Reno said the President’s resi-
dential areas were not officially con-
sidered government property, that
the Vice President was exempt for
making phone calls for contribu-
tions since he used a non-govern-
ment credit card, and that none of
the covered individuals had partici-
pated in getting foreign money into
the campaign funds.

Reno defended her position by
saying she did appoint independent
counsels for Whitewater and the
travel office mismanagement. She
also says that the many justice de-
partment and FBI officials working
on investigating the allegations are
enough to find wrongdoing.

Children’s health insurance bill might pass Congress

A bill championed by Ted
Kennedy (D — Mass.) and Orrin
Hatch (R — Utah) to give health care
coverage to half of the nation’s un-
insured children looks as if it could
pass Congress soon.

In what could be the first piece
of major legislation of the 105th
Congress, the bill aims to increase
taxes on cigarette packs by 43 cents.

The money gained from the tax
would go to giving health care in-
surance to five million of the
nation’s uninsured children. Most
Democratic senators are behind the

bill and about six Republicans have
agreed to vote for it as well.

The bill would also give the
federal government about $5 bil-
lion dollars in deficit reduction funds
after it covers many of the intended
children.

Its main opposition comes from
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
who fears it is just “another big
government program.” House Bud-
get Committee chairman John
Kasich (R — Ohio) thinks it is “not
good to raise taxes to pay for an-
other government program.” Of

course, congressmen from tobacco
producing states will fight against
it. Senator Wendell Ford (D—Kent.)
has major reservations about the
bill.

Still, supporters of the bill look
at it as just another way to recoup
expenses paid by Medicare and
Medicaid for those who suffer. ill
health due to cigarettes. It is also
pro-family, anti-deficit, and mod-
est in scale so it could easily have a
strong chance of passing.

Pope visits Sarajevo.

Pope John Paul II gave a service in Sarajevo and called for reconcili-
ation between the factions in that region. Just hours before he arrived,
police removed mines that were on his route between the airport and
the city. Thousands packed his service and braved frigid weather to
hear his calls for “not just material reconstruction (of the area) alone,
(but also) spiritual rebuilding of minds of hearts.” The Pope had been
planning the trip for many weeks since the war had stopped.

New Legislature starts work in Hong Kong

China’s appointed legislature for Hong Kong took its first lawmaking
step in defiance of opposition from the territory’s pro-democracy
lobby. The Chinese government established the provisional legisla-
ture and has given it the job of amending local laws before Hong Kong
returns to China on July 1st. The bill dealt with new holidays the
Chinese government wants to institute. The actions went on peace-
fully amidst protests from the pro-democracy groups who questioned
why Hong Kong had two legislatures working side by side.

Difficult issue unresolved in sweatshop agreement

Many major clothing apparel manufacturers, such as Nike, Reebok,
L.L. Bean, and Liz Claiborne, have agreed to publicly monitor their
industry’s practices regarding the use of sweatshop labor in their
global factories. The move was spurred on with a bargain by human
rights and labor groups who are fighting to let the public become more
aware of how their clothes are made and which companies violate
human rights most often in their manufacturing practices. Still, the
groups are calling for some sort of independent agency to be the
official watchdog and still might want a minimum wage for this type
of factory labor. The companies insist they can watch themselves and
are hesitant to agree to wage standards.
