Fairies lament of boredom,
report slight softball action

By THE
THREE FAIRIES

This has been undoubtedly
the slowest week in IMAC
sports history. The lack of
action has been attributed
primarily to the popularity of
certain indoor sports over the
past week, and there’s been no
volleyball. Rays, lays, and J's
replaced bases, bats, and
balls.

We would be able to write a
half-decent article this week, if
first, anything had happened;
if, second, we could obtain a
visa from the history depart-
ment in order to leave the
library; if, third, we really
cared.

In the little softball action
which did occur, Felix Japp
and John Tatum umpired their
best game of the year as
Richardson I fell in a hard-
fought forfeit to the Inquisi-
tion.

Proving their entrepreneur-
ial abilities, the speedy pair of
Japp and Tatum was able to
pick up an extra two bucks by
officiating the Castrati’s 18-8
victory over PIKA at the same
time (God bless free enter-
prise!).

Speaking of ‘‘umpires’’,
why don’t you jackasses start
writing something about these
games on the cards so we will
be able to abuse people we
don’t know. Go ahead, make
something up.

In other thrillers, the Flam-
ing A’s blasted Buford’s Bat-
allion 9-0, Spring Fever frag-
ged the Rowdy Rotcies 24-13,
and the Bongs stained D.C.
and the Polychetes 12-5.

The Wooley Greys forfeited

to Cannon II, as Mike Gibson
showed up and the rest of the
Greys refused to play. Inci-
dentally, the print-hungry
quasi-jocks of Cannon II have
repeatedly begged us for ink.
These boys are under the
mistaken impression that they
have talent, a quality lacking
in the entire freshman class.
By the way, we transferred in
as sophomores.

Passive Indifference had the
Thi’s down 11-5, only to be ten
run-ruled three innings later,
22-12. Jimmy Stephenson
made dinner on time.

Division-leading Spring Fe-

ver had their bubble burst by
Brad Sebastian and a new
softball. Sebastian hit two
ridiculously long home runs to
the opposite field, leading the
Kerwood Derbies to a 13-3
victory. Eyball made dinner
on time and A.D. didn’t eat.

This column is now being
torn by internal dissention.

All three Phi Delt softball
teams went down to defeat
this week.

A fourteen-run fourth inn-
ing lifted SAE #1 past Delt B,
14-4, the Panama Reds nipped
Delt A, 4-3, and Your Face
forfeited to Embo.

Appalachian St. tramples trackmen,
SC championships to run next Friday

Davidson’s trackmen suf-
fered their third loss of the
season last Thursday when
they fell to Appalachian State
105-56 in a dual meet at
Boone.

With a smaller team than
usual, the Cats ‘‘ran as well as

we expected,’’ according to §&

track coach Sterling Martin,
but were overpowered by
ASU, who also took second
place in last week’s Davidson
Relays.

“We didn’t stack the meet
like we could have, but then
neither did they,’’ Martin
added; ‘‘The score was just
about what we had predicted.”

The Cats had only two first
places in the contest--Jarry

4:16.6 to break the old school
record of 4:18 set by Pete
Ashcraft: in 1956. Horn was
beaten by two seconds by
ASU’s Louis Blount, who
passed Horn on the final
stretch.

Other Davidson second
place finishes were Allen Scha-
berg in discus, Bill Cole in the
steeplechase, Ray Berberick
in the javelin, Bob Schermer
in the 100 and 220, and
McPhail in the 120 high and
440. intermediate hurdles.

McPhail’s time of 15.1 in
the highs was a personal
record.

Fred Borch, after trailing
the field by almost half a lap,
came back to take second in
the three mile run, and John
Stanfield also had a second
place in the high jump.

Stanfield cleared 6’0’’ and
went out at 6’2”’ after sus-
taining an ankle injury which,
according to Martin, ‘could
possibly hurt him in the
conference meet.”’

The Cats’ next action is here
Saturday against The Citadel
in a meet which Martin calls
“our toughest yet.’’ Martin
added that ‘‘we should win if
everyone is healthy and per-
forms up to par.”’ He said that
his strategy for the contest
would be to ‘“‘get firsts where
we can and rely on our greater
depth to carry us through.”

The trackmen, with a 2-3
record, need The Citadel meet
for an even season.

A week from this Friday,
the Southern Conference
championship meet will be
held at Davidson. Martin
urged that, as for the David-
son Relays, he needs a large
number of students to help run
that meet.
