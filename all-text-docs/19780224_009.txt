Chairman says college
must keep church ties

Once Dr. Warner Hall was on the
Davidson Board of Trustees, it did not
take him long to rise to prominence.

A few years after his 1954 appoint-
ment, Hall was named vice-chairman of
the Board under Dr. McDowell Rich-
ards. When Richards retired, he was
asked to continue in this position under
Dr. Walter Lingle.

Twenty-four years later, ‘Hall is

tor of the Presbyterian Foundation

Caring students visit area nursing home weekly

As students at a small college in a
small college town, Davidson College
residents have limited exposure to a
large variety of age groups, particular-
ly the young and elderly. The YMCA
STEP tutor program provides for the
former.

But how about contact with folks of
grandparent age,
great many of them are in care centers
or confined to hospital beds? Steve
Justus, ‘78, came up with a solution
last school year, when he pioneered a
weekly visitation program to the
Huntersville hospital/nursing home
complex.

The program started small, with a
few freshmen on Steve’s hall and some
fellow SAE’s helping out when they
could. One of the Huntersville admini-
strators ‘assigned’ various members
of the elderly community to the student
participants, so that each student
developed, literally, an old friendship.

The program has experienced pheno-
menal growth since it first began over a
year ago. When the circus came to
