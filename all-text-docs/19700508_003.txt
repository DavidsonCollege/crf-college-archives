A new look has come .to
the Wildcat offensive with
the much heralded “wish

used by the University of

Besides running inside

and moving the fullback te-

The triple-option, one of
the most difficult but effec

a major weapon in this for-
mation. Wofford used it

Mark Thompson. Thompson,
a senior next year, was
praised by Fagg as ‘‘an out
standing athelete with tre-
mendous desire.”

The question remains
whether or not he can fill
Gordon Slade’s shoes. Fagg
seems to believe .that he
can. Thompson can_ throw

as welf as run a good triple-
option.

He will be backed up by
Rick Kemmerlin and Scotty
Shipp. Shipp is the number
one punter on the team and
could be effectively used for
shotgun formations, punting
tricks, or quick kicks.

Fagg feéls that an offense
as flexible as this can keep
the opposing defense
step behind. However, he
‘expressed the fear that Da-
vidson’s defense would be
caught short in a_ similar
manner by other teams.

But he did not hesitate to
commend several members
of the defensive unit,
Dumich was cited as an out
standing defensive back with
good hands and speed. Chris
Giles and Montgomery will
call the defensive signals at
middle linebacker.

Fagg's top two men on
the front line will probably
be tackle Ken Totherow and
“imposing™ Ricky Snipes, a

Slade Candidate For Top Athlete,
Indicates Pro Future With Colts

By RICK BUSH
Sports Writer

Closing out his career as
a collegiate athlete this
week, two-sport star Gordon
Slade is again leading the
Wildcats baseball team in

nearly évery Soffensive cate- °

gory.
This is of course not an
unusual or uncomfortable

position for the husky left
fielder, for it’s been three
years since someone other
than Slade held the title of
Davidson's ‘Big Stick.”
“Gordon should be the
conference Athlete - of- the -
Year.” This is the way
Coach Tom. Stevens de-

scribes Slade’s value to the
baseball team, and the re-
gard he has for his achieve-
ments of the past three
years.

Slade has been at the .400
level since the Furman
doubleheader and the East-
ern Baptist game. Despite

‘his lower average this year,

Stevens pointed out that
Slade has driven in more
runs this year than ever be-
fore.

“Gordon's a_ real fine
athlete, one of the best
we've ever had at David-
son,’ said Stevens.

“Gordon is .a line drive

hitter, he dosen’t try to lift
the ball. Sometimes | wish

he'd hit the long ball,
need someone whe is a real
threat,” Stevens added.

There is nothing in Slade's
record to belie Stevens’
statement. He has led the
team in hitting, with aver-
ages of 429, .369, and .333.

He is a two-year unani--
mous All Southern Confer-
ence selection, with a strong
chance of repeating this
year.

College-Sponsored Camps
Slated For Summer Activity

The campus will be alive
this summer as college
sponsored clinics for basket
ball, tennis,, and baseball
will be-offered.

For the “tennis and base-
ball camps this will be the
first year of operation, while
the sixth annual Wildcat
Basketball Camp is under
new administrative controls.

In the past the basketball
camp was an individual un-
dertaking of coach Lefty
Driesell, who made financi-
al—arrangements with the

college for the use of cam: .

pus facilities. The camp
was a purely personal un-
dertaking with Driesell a
ting all the. profits.

This year the paerecall
camp, as are the two other
camps, is run entirely by
the school. The instructors
in the camps, including the
Davidson coaches dnd their
assistants, are under a
salary arrangement y with the
college. :

According to Athletic Di-
rector Tom Scott, all the
coaches were given the op-
portunity to have a sum-
mer camp and only the
three who have camps
scheduled responded.

“It is designed primarily
to make use of the resources
of the college,’ said Scott.
“It gives the coaches a job
on campus and in Davidson

rather than at a camp some-
where else.

“The two main reasons
for the camps are that it
gives the coaches a summer
employment and it is a ser-
vice for our alumni who
have children who wish to
enroll, as well as being a
service to sports.”

Athletic Buisiness Man-
ager Col. Frederick P. Out-
law added thd&ghts on the
benefits of the camps for
the college. ‘This program
keeps some of the staff here
on campus during the sum-
mer and gives them a
chance to see how the
facilities: may be used for
the fall physical ‘education
program.” ;

“It's not' a project . to

“make a big profit ,for the

school.”

Outlaw estimated that the
applications for the *“basket-
ball camp have _ reached
about 60% of the total cay}
pacity. The tennis ~registra-
tion rests at about the same
figure. A
’ Outlaw noted that there is
heavy competition this year *,
from other camps, ‘‘Every-
one seems to have the idea

that they can open a.camp: .|

and make a lot of money.”
According to Outlaw, the
baseball camp ‘‘is not fill-
ing as fast.’’ About; 30% of °
the camp's capacity is-en- >

rolled. ‘'As of now we're not
ready to cancel it,’ said
Outlaw. “If by about May
20, we don't have enough
people to meet expenses,
we'll have to make a de-
cision.”

The tennis camp will ac-
comodate about 100 capati-
ty, the basketball camp
about 600 and the. baseball
camp 80-100.

The participants in
camp programs will
housed in Belk and Watts
dormitories, with the coun-
selors and several staff
members living with them.

The college is also negoti-
ating for the use of the Da-
vidson Elementary Gym in
case of bad weather. Out-
law said that the gyms. in

He was elected captain for

this season, and has been
elected the team’s Most
Valuable Player for three
years,

Add to gill of these the
nonors he has earned in
football, and it is not hard

to see why Stevens is push-
ing his star for the confer
ence’s top award.

Drafted this past winter
by the Baltimore Colts of
the National Football Lea
gue, Slade has for alP in-
tents and purposes’ decided
to pursue that track into
professional athletics.

“I'm, going to sign
Baltimore in about
weeks. I don't think
baseball team will be
ing to pay me enough to
keep me from playing foot-
ball.”

Although he has tried to
give equal attention to both
sports while at Davidson,
Slade admits to a slight pre-
ference ‘for football. How-
ever, the big factor in his
choice of pro football is his
already late start into a
baseball career:

“It-takes—five_years to
make the big leagues. It's
so important to get start-
ed at 17 or 18."

So, Slade’s choice of a
college education was also
his choice of football over
baseball. He says that it’s
a decision he won't regret,
both be@ause of his success
in footbalf and the value_of
the education he has re-
ceived.

“‘Now,

more about baseball! How-
ever, one of the reasons I

to play baseball in the
South.”

- ‘And we’re- glad he did,”
