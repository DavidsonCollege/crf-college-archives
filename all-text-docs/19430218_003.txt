sessed that our boys just weren't used to such newfangled

Whether or not the boys could have come through
in more rustic surroundings is, of course, a matter of
question, but it is certain that they were far from being
at home on that spacious floor. Let this not be con-
sidered another dig at the athletic facilities at David-
son, for we realize that if it were after the duration
the ’Cats would be performing in equally pretentious
surroundings.

It is true though that playing at home is a tremendous
advattage im basketball, more so than in any other sport. The
most obvious handicap to the ‘Cats when playing away from
home the different arrangément of the backlards—ex-

Miscellany
‘Cat supporters are bemoaning the fact that many of

Carolina’s basketball players have been called to the colors—
one week too late—including Jim White, who has been out-
standing all season. About the same time there was a mass
exodus from Georgia Tech of athletic saterlites including
the great Clint Castleberry.” College atheletes are really be-
ginning to feel the pinch It has indeed been an- unusual
court season: For a while Davidson was wondering whether
or not they would be seeded in the tournament. Now they
are wondering if they'll be in it at all.
