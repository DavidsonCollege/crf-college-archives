In a hastily-called news con-
ference Friday evening, Charlotte
Observer publisher Rolfe Neill an-
nounced that the Trustees have
granted the copyright of the
Davidsonian to the Charlotte Ob-
server.

“This is a great decision for the
Observer and for Davidson,” Neill
said. ““Vagt [Davidson’s-new presi-
dent] and the Trustees gave us the
go-ahead for this Thursday. His
plan to run Davidson more like a
business fit well with our strategy
of diversifying our market.”

Neill explained that the changes
will occur next semester. The cur-
rent Davidsonian staff will be re-
tained but will be enjoy the full use

of Observer facilities and support
staff. Also, some new features will
be coming to the Davidsonian next
semester.

“We want to extend the same
great coverage we give our Char-
lotte readers into the Davidson mar-
ket,” said Neill.

Details of the Observer’s pro-
posals were released to the
Davidsonian by an anonymous
Davidson College official. They
include filling ‘nearly three-forths
of the paper’s space with ads, jack-
ing the font size up to 20 point, and
cutting the average story length by
half. An Ebonics edition of the
newspaper will also be offered so
that everyone has equal access to
quality education.

Defense attorneys including
Johnnie Cochran and Robert
Shapiro. School officials are confi-
dent that all charges will be dropped
and that the accused students will
receive medals for being persecuted
by the legal system. Cochran and
Shapiro have no comment to make
about the case at this time.

[Begin article] On April 31,
agents from the North Carolina State
Bureau of Investigation (SBI) raided
the Davidson College campus and
charged 1588 of the school’s 1601
students with felonies and misde-
meanors under Articles 14-177 and
14-184 of the General Statutes of
North Carolina.

The 13 students not charged
include all members past and present
of the executive board of
InterVarsity Christian Fellowship
(IVCF) and campus activist Eric
Sapp. :

Article 14-177 reads: “If any
person shall commit the crime
against nature, with mankind or
beast, he shall be guilty of a felony
and shall be fined or imprisoned in
the discretion of the court.”

Crimes against nature include
fellatio, cunnilingus, analingus, anal
sex, homosexual acts, and any “‘in-

decent methods to gratify a per-
verted and depraved sexual instinct
which is an offense against public
decency and morality.” (State v.
Adams, 1980)

Article 14-184 reads: “If any
man and woman, not being married
to each other, shall lewdly and las-

civiously associate, bedandcohabit -

together, they shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor ... Any person vio-
lating any provision of this section
shall be punishable by a fine not to
exceed five hundred dollars
($500.00), imprisonment for not
more than six months, or both.”
SBlagent Phillip Winston says,
“The campus police were receiving
quite a number of complaints from

members of the community about —

the noise generated by the school at
night. Originally, they thought it
was coming from frat parties,-and
although the parties are indeed loud,
much of the noise was coming from
young couples rutting like animals.”
Winston continues, “The cam-
pus police are equipped primarily
to give students parking tickets and
watch them while they puke their
guts out, and when they realized
that the sounds were the result of
felonious activity, they called us in.
“They just aren’t equipped to
deal with felonies, and that’s what

demic crowd up there,” Neill said.

The Observer proposes to bring
its legendary columnist Doug Smith
to grace the pages of the
Davidsonian. The cheerleader who
has steadfastly reported on
Charlotte’ s blossoming into a world-
class city, Smith writes a daily busi-
ness column in the Observer. His
columns chronicle the exciting de-
velopments in the world of strip
mall openings, drug store expan-
sions, flexible-use office space, and
regional call centers.

“I think Davidson needs to
wake up to reality,” Smith said.
“Some light assembly space, up-
scale shops, maybe a condo com-
plex could liven up Main Street a
little bit. Davidson’s gota long way
to go before its office space and
retail catch Charlotte’s urban so-
phistication, but it’s got potential.”

Sports reporter Tom Sorensen
would also come on board to re-
place Michael Kruse as saab edi-
tor.

“Tom could bring his enthusi-
asm for the Hornets up to Davidson,
where they could use some of his
encouragement. Michael Kruse’s
coverage is so negative — we need
someone to idolize our athletes, and
Tom does that well,” said Neill.
Some students seemed to like the
professionalization of the school
paper. “Maybe we can use the
money we save to flood the campus
with strobe lights and buy every
student the Jeep Cherokee they de-
serve,” said Lucian Dervan. SGA
President Buster Burk was report-
edly tangled in a nasty swing set
accident and could not be reached
for comment.

Eric Sapp was present at the

news conference and was outraged.
“This is adisgusting abuse of power
by the liberal establishment of this
school. Who gave Vagt the right to
take the paper away from the stu-
dents? I always thought so highly
of the studenteditors,” Sapp shouted
as his voice trailed off, choked with
emotion.

Reaction from the faculty was de-
cidedly more negative. “This is
what happens when you let some-
body without a Ph.D. take on the
leadership of an academic institu-
tion. I don’t believe he’s qualified
to make these decisions,” said an
English professor who did not wish
to be identified.

Another biology professor was
indifferent. “For five days of the
week Davidson students pretend to
think, then they drink and hook up.
It doesn’t matter what happens.”

Will Bradshaw

FREEZE! Davidson students, apphousers Dick Holder and drecinsin Virginia Jones were testing out
the sound quality of Love Auditorium when Sergeant Hightower and “Great” Dane Laney rushed in
shooting. Davidphonian photogropher Brad Willshow was on hand to witness the arrest. (“I was there

strictly for the ’

onian,” he says.) Holder and Jones were surgically seperated at the Davidson Clinic

and sent to Mecklenburg County Jail without passing Go. They hired Nob Reigert's attorney and are

sure to get off.

One big ass.
