Plans have been completed for the arrival of several
hundred alumni on the campus tomorrow for the 1953 Home-
coming. The day will begin with the annual meeting of the
Wildcat Club at 10:30 a.m., in the ballroom of College Union.

Olen W. Nesbitt of Charlotte,
president of the group, will pre-

ficers and the presentation of re-
ports as the main order of busi-
ness,

Installation of Officers

At 11:45 am. the alumni convo-
cation will be held in the ballroom
of the Ovens College Union. Mr.
Osborne Bethea, '22, president of
the Alumni Association, will wel-
come the alumni and make his an-
nual report. This will be followed
by the installation of the 1954 of-
ficers who are Dr. Frank L. Jack-
son of Davidson, national presi-
dent, and Dwight Moody Chalmers
of Greenville, S. C., national vice-

cert Band under the direction of
Kenneth Moore and the Male
Chorus directed by Donald Plott.

“Wildcats” Honored

A special event of the alumni
convocation will be the presenta-
tion of the 1917 football team,
who will be honored guests

throughout the day. This will be
their 36th reunion. They were the
original “Wildcats” having been
dubbed that name by an Atlanta
Journa) sports writer.

They were also called the light-
weight champions of the United
States, averaging only 156 pounds.
Nevertheless they compiled an ex-
cellent record by beating such
teams as Wake Forest 73-7 and
Wofford 62-0.

The convocation will be closed
with the president's report by Dr.
John R. Cunningham.

At 1:00 p.m. the annual barbe-
cue luncheon will be held on the
South Court. All students, alumni,
and their guests will be welcomed.

The Homecoming game with
Presbyterian, beginning at 2:30
p.m., will complete the day’s activ-
ities. Halftime ceremonies will fea-
ture two notable events. The 1917
football team, which will sit in a
body behind the Davidson bench,
will be presented.

Recognition will also be given
to Capt. James C. Harper, °15, di-
rector of the celebrated Lenoir
High School Band. This will be
their 25th appearance at a David-
son Homecoming game.

DAVIDSON'S GEORGE|Beaver Club Plans
FADING FROM VIEW |Helpful Projects

By AUSTIN STRAND

Davidsonian News Rditor

The big question around David-
son this year for the upperclass-
men has been that of the where-
abouts of Davidson’s legendary
Beowulf, better known as King
George.
Moody Smith, e@itor of this rag,
instructed your reporter not to
leave a stone unturned in finding
out first, if George was alive, and
second, why he had deserted the
Davidson campus.

George is very much alive, as
many of the local currs can vouch
for. His owner, Mr. Leroy Ken-
nerly, reported that George is now
at the ripe old age of seven.

Asked if there were any reasons
why George no longer came to
Davidson and attended her classes,
chapel, and other such meetings,
infiltrating all with that delicious
aroma that always surrounded him,
Mr. Kennerly stated “I reckon
George is just getting too old for
all that mess.”

As to why Davidson has lost her
popularity with this delectible
beast, there is no doubt but that
that question shall go unanswered.
Possibly George got fed up with
all that bull that got shot, both
in lectures and on tests; or possi-
bly he just got tired of being
picked on, shoved around, avoided,
bathed, and petted.

You can still see this old soldier
wandering around the town, still
being avoided, and it is a crying
shame that the freshman and
sophomore classes must be with-
out this grand Davidson tradition.

The only way to sum up such a
report would be to quote the words
of the Davidsonian’s first-page man,
Henry Brockmann, when he said,
on reading this article which is
unfit for print, “Well, I'lt be dog-
goned.”

53 Scholarship Cup
Taken By Sigma Chi

According to statistics contained
in the annual report of Mr. F. W.
Hengeveld, director of admissions
and registrar, the all-student aver-
age for 1962-1963 was 1.506. Among
the classes, the seniors led with
1.86, followed by the juniors, soph-
omores and freshmen in that order.

The all-fraternity average was
1.483, with Sigma Chi nosing out
Beta Theta Pi 1.004 to 1.789 for
midividual honors. The others in
order were Phi Gamma Delta, Phi
Delta Theta, Kappa Sigma, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Phi Epsilon,
Pi Kappa Alpha, Kappa Alpha, Al-
pha Tau Omega and Pi Kappa Phi.

The track squad was tops among
the athletes, closely followed by
the basketball and baseball teams.

Last weekend when the Mary-

ville cross country team arrived:

on the Davidson campus, on hand
to extend a welcome to them was
Dickie Davis, president of the
Beaver Club.

Perhaps better known for his
standout performance in the for-
ward wall of the football team,
Dickie also was administering his
duties as president of an organiza-
tion of 21 athletically minded
juniors and sophomores known as
the Beaver Club.

The Beavers make a point of
seeing that visiting athletic teams
are properly greeted and made to
feel at home during their stay at
Davidson.

Aside from this principal func-
tion, the Beavers sponsor two

worthwile campus projects each;

year: a clothing drive for a chari-
table organization and the tradi-
tional senior auction; both of which
are non-profit affairs.

The Club’s slate of officers for
1953-54 consists of Dickie Davis
as president, Frank Mitchener as
vice-president with Dickie Adams

DR. ELFAN REES
TO SPEAK TUESDAY

Dr. Elfan Rees, advisor on refu-
gee affairs to the World Council
of Churches, and secretary in,
Geneva, Switzerland, of the Com-
mission of the Churches on Inter-
national Affairs, will speak to the
Davidson student body next Tues-

lay.

Mr. Rees has taken a prominent
part in organizing several confer-
ences of refugee specialists, in-
cluding the Hamburg Conference
of 1849, which alerted the world’s
attention to Germany's refugee
problem, the Salzburg Conference
of 1950, another refugee specialist
conference, and the Beirut Confer-
ence of 1951, which surveyed the
needs of more than 800,000 refu-
gees from Palestine.

Mr. Rees was born at Brecon,
Wales in 1006. In 1934 he was
appointed director of the South
Wales Council of Social Service,
and for the following four years,
he aided in the relief of unem-
ployed Welsh miners.

After three years of military
service as a Wing Commander in
the Royal Air Force, Mr. Rees be-
came in 1944 senior welfare spe-
cialist for the Balkan Commission
of the UNRRA.

In 1947 Mr. Rees was appointed
director of the Refugee Division
of the World Council Department
of Relief and Reconstruction, and
in 1049 he became its special ad-
-viser on refugee affairs charged
with Ilason work on behalf of refu-
gees with national and internation-
al governmental representatives.

Mr. Rees attended, in 1950, ses-
sions of the U. N. General As-
sembly at Flushing Meadows,
New York, as a representative of
the Commission of the Churches
on International Affairs.

Mr. Rees will be in the United
States for several months, follow-
ing April 18, attending UNESCO
sessions as a representative of
non-governmental organizations on
refugee matters.

NOTICE

Davidson's cross country run-
ners yesterday came home
with the colleges first athletic
victory of the 1953 season.
The Cats took ean impressive

Le Cercle Francais
Bids 13 Students

Le Cercle Francais opened its
fall activities with a meeting at
the home of Dr. and Mrs. A. V.
Goldiere on Thursday night, Octo-
ber 9th.

Presiding over the business
meeting was Norman Johnson,
president, and Gregory Dimijian,
new secretary. The other officer
of the national honorary French
club at Davidson is vice president
Fred Summers.

Profess'~ Jones was in charge
of the pr sram. He gave an inter-
esting account of Parisian sidewalk
cafes as he had the opportunity
to observe them while studying as
a Fullbright scholar.

Following Mr. Jones’ entertain-
ing talk Gregory Dimijian gave a
review in French of a_ recent
article from the Chaflotte Observer
dealing with the trip of Henri
Monte to France. Mr. Monte is the
manager-owner of the Chez Montet
in Charlotte where each year the
group has a banquet.

Following the program, the
members sang French songs and
then enjoyed some refreshments.

The next meeting was scheduled
to be held on November 10th and
all new members are especially
urged to be present. The following
advanced French students were in-
vited to membership: J. H. Gaskin,
J. T. Harmon, W. H. Kuykendal,
F. G. Myers, A. B. Brinkerhoff,
J. J. Crymes, A. J. Harris, J. E.
Lewis, C. H. Rendieman, R. E.
Evans, E. L. Chaney.

Bruno Eijnard and C. J. Cash,
the two new foreign students,
were also extended invitations to
join the organization.

DRIVE SUCCESSFUL
3 FRATS HAVE 100”

This fall’s blood drive in David-
son ended very successfully, ac-
cording to the official results re-
leased Wednesday. There were
348 pints donated by the stydents

and town members, with from 90
to 100 members of athletic teams
excused.

The competition among frater-
nities was quite keen, and three
of them had 100 per cent donating.
These three are Beta Theta Pi, Al-
pha Tau Omega, and Pi Kappa Al-
pha, all of which will receive 100
per cent Red Cross Certificates in
chapel in the near future. All of
the student body as well as these
particular fraternities were praised
for doing a great job.

Most of the blood donated in this
drive will go toward making gam-
ma globulin to fight polio. The
rest will be used in Veterans’ Hos-
pitals and in building up the plas-
ma stock of the nation.

Lenoir High School Band

Davidson College will pay spe-
cial tribute to the Lenoir High
School Band and its director, Cap-
tain James C. Harper, during the
college’s 28th homecoming celebra-
tion Saturday.

The band, and its director, will
be marking a milestone tomorrow
when they celebrate the completion
of twenty-five years of playing for
football games at Davidson Col-
lege. The band, playing out of
Lenoir, N.€., will also complete
thirty years of continuous opera-
tion next March, the string having
started back in 1924.

Its first appearance at a David-
son football game was on Novem.
ber 17th, 1928, when it played for
a game between Davidson and the
University of North Carolina. This
date also marked the first time
any high school band had played
at a Davidson game.

The next trip to the Davidson
campus by Capt. Harper and his
musical aggregation was on the
succeeding year, November 16. The
game this time was also between
Davidson and Carolina. During this
contest a driving rainstorm came
and halted the game for some little
time.

When it was resumed the direc
tor of the Davidson band asked
Capt. Harper if he would loan him

By CHUCK WRIGHT

a group of his first chair players
to play some of the pieces that
were beyond the ability of his
band to play alone. When Capt.
Harper obliged the director, it left
some of his own members just
watching the game.

When the college athletic autho-
ritles saw them, in uniform, and
since the college was paying the
expenses of the high school band
to come to the game, they thought
that Capt. Harper wasn’t playing
square with them. So they refused
to let the band come back to Da-
vidson for a number of years.

Everything was finally ironed
out, however, when Capt. Harper
explained the situation. And since
that time they have played at a
great many of the homecoming
games.

They have played for three ad-
ditional games between Davidson
and North Carolina, three for con-
tests between Davidson and V.M.L,
one for Davis versus Wake Forest,
one for Davidson and V.P.1,, one
for Davidson against Richmond
University, one for Davidson and
Washington and Lee, one for Da-
vidson and Furman, and one Da-
vidson-Presbyterian game previous
to tomorrow's affair, Most of these
games have been for homecoming.
The Lenoir band has also played

Marks Milestone Saturday

for games at all the larger colleges
in North Carolina and many in
neighboring states.

Capt. Harper, a graduate of Da-
vidson College in the class of 1915,
founded the Lenoir Band in 1624.
It is the oldest high school band
in the state that has been in con-
tinuous operation. Two earlier ones
at Winston-Salem and Greensboro
later went out of business and were
not resumed until many years
later, under different personnel.

The band and its director also
have the honor of being the first
high school band to play at any
college football game in the state
of North Carolina, playing for the
North Carolina-Virginia Thanks-
giving game in Chapel Hill in 1927.

The high school organization re-
cently received another honor
when Governor Umstead officially
named them ambassadors of good
will to the State of Maryland. They
played at Annapolis for Gov. Theo-
dore R. McKeldin, who afterwards
signed a proclamation making all
the members of the group hon-
orary citizens of the state.

So when the Lenoir High School
Band parades onto the field at
half time in tomorrow’s game, be
sure to take a good look. You're
watching a real group of
musicians.

Article By Abernethy
Appears In Century

Prof. George L. Abernethy of
Davidson College is the author of
an article, “Pakistan at the Cross-
roads,” in the current issue of The
Christian Century.

In the article, Dr. Abernethy dis-
cusses the difficult internal prob-
lems which confront Pakistan in
her seventh year of independence,
and the unsolved problems in her
relations with India.

During the academic year 1952-
$3, Dr. Abernethy studied com-
parative religion of the Middle
East and Pakistan at Columbia
University under a_ fellowship
granted by the Ford Foundation's
Fund for the Advancement of Edu-
cation.

He has been professor of philos-
ophy at Davidson since 1946.

arrive in Davidson late this aft-
ernoon. He returns after his en-
gagement here for the Midwinters
Dances last year.

Always a sweet band and winner
of the coveted Downbeat poll in
that Category, Charlie's outfit is
placing more emphasis on soft,
danceable melodies than ever be-
fore. Spivak plays plenty of licks
for the trained ear.

Charlie has come along way
since the days when he was known
as one of the greatest jazz
trumpeters. He has admittedly gone
commercial and if that's bad then
money in the bank is also bad.
He has established records at New
York's Hotel Statler, the top hotel
dance spot; and the Paramount
Theatre on Broadway, mecca for
dancing bands to prove he's in the
right groove.

One of the managers at the Stat-
ler Hotel in New York summed up
perfectly when he said, “Spivak
blows clear enough for all to hear
but people can still carry on a
conversation.”

EUROPEAN

European criticism of the

American economic and foreign] ly

policies was stresesd by Professor
lain Wilson in his talk before the
student body Tuesday.

Professor Wilson, just back from
a European tour, said that many
Europeans could not understand
the aspects of American foreign
policy, especially the stubbornness
of America in not trying to ease
relationships with India. He stated
that many Europeans do not be-
lieve America able to show nation-
al flexibility in her foreign policy.

According to Professor Wilson,
his first impression of his summer
trip did not come in Europe, but
rather on the boat going across
the Atlantic. There were eight
hundred students on this voyage,
and Professor Wilson took part in
the Orientation program, telling
the students about the European
feelings concerning the United
States.

Professor Wilson remarked of
the great experience in seeing such
a cross section of learning, and he
said that it was at this time that
he realized the vastness of these
United States.

The quality of the students on
board was extremely high, as they
were a uniformly fair-minded
group, willing to see the other's
point of view.

Unpopulerity Rumor False

In his talk, Professor Wilson dis-
couraged the idea of America's un-
popularity in Europe by ssying that

it was a false impression. He said

that there is a strong hostility to
certain phases of American life,
but this hostility is national and

Fraternity Functions
Planned For Week-end

ORIGINAL WILDCATS
RETURN T0 CAMPUS
FOR BiG REUNION

Davidson College's original Wild-
cats are coming back to the cam-
pus Saturday some 36 years after
earning the college its athletic
nickname. .

Alumni Secretary John L. Payne
announced today that a reunion
of the 1917 football team will be
one of the highlights of the col-
lege’s 28th homecoming celebra-
tion.

Georgia Tech’s powerful eleven
grabbed the number one ranking
and it was in the Tech game that
Davidson’s potent little squad
earned the nickname “Wildcats.”

After the bruising battle, which
Tech won by 32-12, an Atlanta
Journal sports writer exclaimed
how “The Red and Black fought
like a bunch of Wildcats.” The
local press picked up the expres-
sion and since that time all of Da-
vidson’s athletic teams have carried
the title.

It was the Atlanta writer, too,
who hailed the team as the "Light-
weight Champions of the U. S.”
There probably weren't many who
disputed the honor since the squad
won their last six games by de-
cisive scores with a team that
averaged exactly 156 pounds per
man!

The right guard was the heftiest
man on the team at 183 pounds.
Scale that, on down to the quarter-
back and left half, weighing in at
130 and 140, respectively, and the
whole squad would look mighty
puny against a present day high
school eleven.

Saturday, the original Wildcats
will return to the campus to. be
honored guests throughout the
day. They'll get together at the
Wildcat Club meeting, be intro.
duced during the alumni convoca-
tion, have special tables for the
barbecue luncheon and will re-
ceive special recognition during
the Davidson-Presbyterian home-
coming game.

FEELINGS

|STRESSED BY WILSON

therefore not to be counted strong-

After giving the European view
of McCarthy and his investigations.
Professor Wilson stated that most
of the eight hundred students said
they had been well received al
over Europe.

Britain Sounder

According to Professor Wilson,
Britain has improved immensely
since he last was there. He said
that there is a spirit of optimism.
The economic condition is better,
and the Britons realize that the
foreign policy of the United States
brought it on. Prof. Wilson stressed
the fact that United States money
given to foreign policy in the
Marshall Plan has not been poured
down the drain.

Professor Wilson seemed to
think that the Coronation of Queen
Elizabeth If brought a new spirit
to Britain.

Having visited Rome for the first
time on this trip, Professor Wil-
son was enhanced by the beauty
of it. He advised any Davidson stu-
dents visiting Europe to spend a
lot of time in a few of the main
spots of Europe and not rush mad-
ly over Europe in an attempt to
see all the sights, “for,” he said,
“All your memories will just be a
blurr.”

Met With Theologians

In closing Professor Wilson told
of his meeting several of the lead-
ing theologians preparing the
ground work for the second World
Conference of Churches. He met
these men in Geneva, Switzerland,
and was given the honor of inter-
preting for them for a short while.

; alumni

All. the social fraternities
and clubs on the Davidson
campus are planning weekend
events to entertain and honor
their dates and alumni. Each
of the groups will have re-
freshments at the fraternity
house during intermission and
after the dance tonight. Simi-
lar plans have been made for
the informal dance tomorrow
night.

In addition to these social activ-
ities, most of the fraternities will
hold open house tomorrow after-
noon after the Davidson-Presby-
terian football game and Spivak
concert so that chapter alumni can
get together to discuss old times
with each other and to meet the
younger brothers and their dates.

Special fraternity events on Sat-
urday will be an alumni supper
by Kappa Sigma fraternity, an
buffet supper by Beta
| Theta Pi, and a hamburger fry by
Sigma Phi Epsilon after the con-
cert.

Plans have been drawn up by
the fraternities to make this the
best Homecoming weekend ever
as regards social life. This will be
the first big college dance for the
freshmen and the first opportunity
to learn what part the fraternity
plays in providing a full social
ife.

Barring the usual downpour of
rain that accompanies Homecom-
ing, and even if it should come,
this week-end promises to be the
first in a series of successful dances
this year.

Rains Combines Wit,
Knowledge, Farming

By JOHN T. HARMON

Mr. Claude Rains, one of the
foremost stars of stage and screen,
honored Davidson on Wednesday
of this week by giving his long-
awaited reading of English poetry
to culture loving Davidsonians.

Rains, in the naturalness of a
member of the group, commented
that this reading tour was a new
experience for him, coming as the
result of a reading he made to
help raise money for a hospital in
Pennsylvania. This outstanding per-
sonality was besieged by requests
for readings and after receiving
extremely favorable comments in
the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin,
he decided to go on an eight-month
tour “just to see whether his body
could take the strain and irregu-
larity involved.”

The principal disadvantage of his
tour, according to Rains, lies in
the fact that he must continually
be away from his Pennsylvania
farm where, he chuckled, he en-
joys raising barley and hay for his
“horsy neighbors.” .

As to the nature of this program,
Mr. Rains said that he was well
aware of some disapproval of his
selection of “Enoch Arden” be-
cause of its “tear-jerking” quality.
He added that along with its senti-
mentalism, the poem also offers
deep meaning, excellent description
and vivid character portrayals.

He hoped that the remainder of
his program, which included
Chaucer’s well-known prologue to
the “Wife of Bath’s Tale,” giving
some aspects of a Kinsey Report in
East Midland dialect, would serve
to counter-balance any dislike of
“Enoch Arden.”

The naturalness exhibited in pub-
lic by his walking through the
cafeteria line was preserved
throughout his personal contacts
with members of the Davidson stu-
dent body and faculty.

After a two-hour session of ar-
ranging footlights, curtains, ete.,
Mr. Rains dryly announced that
the only reward he should wish
for his patience and perseverance
was a dry martini. Later, as he

.| gave interviews, he nonchalantly

prepared for an afternoon nap and
telephoned his wife in Baltimore
to inform her, as he said, “of his
continued good health ‘and well-
being.”

Davidson is indeed fortunate to
have had such a polished and dis-
tinguished celebrity on its campus.
