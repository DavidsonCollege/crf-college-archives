time, Jason and Phoebe’s love for each other is
apparent, but they remain apart. During this time
they write a number of theatrical hits.

The interplay and tension between Jason and
Phoebe was captured by Dan Cooke and Andra
Whitt. Cooke was able to bring the right amount
of flair, restraint, and comedy to the character of
Jason. Andra, the only member of the cast with
prior mainstage experience, brought the character
development of Phoebe to life. Andra’s character
enters the story as “P.J.,” a naive schoolteacher,
and becomes “Phoebe,” the successful playwright
and novellist.

Phoebe and Jason’s relationship is highlighted
and affected by Phoebe’s relationshiop with Leo
Janowitz (Matt Strader). Strader combined a
certain comic charm with seriousness in his por-
trayal of the journalist. Equally important in the
development of Phoebe and Jason’s relationship

is Kate Mallory (Molly Shaw). Kate Mallory’s
brief appearance was made a comically memo-
rable one by the Shaw’s sharp performance.

The performance, as a whole, was a sharp
one. It had some interesting surprises, like the use
ofa projector in between scenes to impart informa-
tidn to the crwod. Time was marked on this
projector by various images from events like the
Vietnam War and Watergate. These events, mark-
ers of the “world outside,” served as a contrast to

the action of the play that occurred entirely in one

room and between six characters.

Even the bouncingly irritating music moved
beyond its melody and functioned as a comedy for
the ears. From director Dr. Alex Pinkston to every
member of the cast and crew, the producers of
“Romantic Comedy” deserve praise. In front of a
small yet enthusiastic crowd in Hodson Hall, the
opening night of this play testified that success is
not bounded by Broadway and love doesn’t occur
without a laugh or two.

“In this uplifting and often bittersweet roman-
tic comedy, 24-year-old Carla Tate (Juliette
Lewis) is a slightly retarded young woman
who, after years of special education at a
private boarding school, has successfully tran-
scended many of her limitations--except her
over-protective mother, Elizabeth (Diane
Keaton). When Carla graduates and returns
home with dreams and ambitions, her need for
personal fulfillment begins to express itself in
ways her mother is unable to accept. When
she falls in love for the first time, Carla defies
her mother in order to prove that despite all
appearances she has the capacity to be a re-
sponsible adult, worthy of love and being
loved. Embarking on a personal journey of
self-discovery, Carla and her boyfriend Danny
(Giovanni Ribisi) set out together to find an-
swers to some of life’s toughest challenges
and to prove that sometimes an ordinary life
can be an extraordinary achievement.”
