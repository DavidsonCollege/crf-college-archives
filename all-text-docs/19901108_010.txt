Seven Newcomers Add Talent To Basketball Squad

By TOM KOONCE

The addition of seven outstand-
ing newcomers has given the
Davidson basketball program a
much-needed shot in the arm.
According to head coach Bob
McKillop, with the addition of
these prospects “we’ ve filled most

No. 22 Pat Holloway

of our immediate needs, outside
shooting and ball handling,” for
the upcoming season.

Critically, the seven players all
come from winning high school
programs and show great promise
of playing wellon the college level.

smooth, comfortable, and fast.

Pat Holloway

Point guard Pat Holloway is a
bona fide blue-chip recruit from
Denver, Co. The 6’0" Holloway is
a superb athlete; he possesses both
a lightning quick first step to the
basket and a deadly touch from the
perimeter.

He led his team at George
Washington High toa 16-8 record.
His heady play has made him the
frontrunner for the starting spot at
point guard.

Jason Zimmerman

Jason Zimmerman, a 6-2 guard
from Warsaw, Indiana, averaged
17.7 points and eight assists for
Warsaw High School. He was se-
lected All-Conference, All-Sec-
tional and All-Regional, and his
team went 21-3 and was ranked
number one in Indiana most of the
year. Zimmerman also played on
the Team Indiana juggernaut that
dismantled a Soviet Junior All-
Star team, 116-97, in Fort Wayne
this summer.

Zimmerman confidently pre-
dicts that “this season should be
very good for Davidson basket-
ball, with all the new faces along
with the veterans. The veterans
have been showing us the ropes,

showing us how it’s done.”

Ron Horton
Ron Horton, a 6-6 forward
from Washington, averaged ten
points and shot 51% from the field
for Gonzaga Prep. His team was
26-8 and ranked tenth in
the Washington, D.C. metro area;

No. 24 Ron Horton

two of his teammates moved on
this yeartoplay for John Thompson
at Georgetown. Horton looked
forward to the season by saying, “I
think the year will be very produc-
tive, because we have alotof talent
and everyone’s competing hard in

practice.”

Jeff Chapin

6’9" Jeff Chapin and 65"
James Marsh are among the other
newcomers at forward. Chapin
comes off a standout season at
Manatee Community College in
which he was a first team All-
Conference selection and played
in the Florida State All-StarGame.
He averaged 16.1 points and 10.2
rebounds in leading Manatee to a
20-8 campaign last year.

James Marsh

Marsh played for North
Hopkins High in Madisonville, Ky.
before being discovered by coach
McKillop last year in Germany; he
is an extremely talented athlete
who may just win the starting job
at small forward.

Janko Narat
The last two recruits will help
shore up the team’s primary liabil-
ity of a year ago: perimeter shoot-
ing. Janko Narat, a 6-6 swingman
from Domzale, Yugoslavia, aver-
aged 13.5 points to lead his Fork
Union Military Academy squad to

a sparkling 28-1 record.
He made 45 percent of his
three-point , field goal attempts

during the season.

Scott Alford
Scott Alford, a 6-6 forward
from Jacksonville, Fla., put in a
well-spent postgraduate year at
Maine Central Institute in Pittsfield,
Maine. Heisa versatile player who

bh... as pete
JasonZimmerman in action

can fill it up from the outside. His
MCI team went undefeated at 24-
0 last year.

Scott forecasts that this year
will be “exciting; all the different
players are blending into a great
team.”
