A Value Judgement

There las been an undercurrent
of discussion here ani ‘there concern-
ing the new projects Ionexpanding the
Student Union and developments on
Lake Norman. Some few students
feel that these projects are not justi-
fied in the face of other-needs which
Davidson faces at the present time,
especially concerning ‘the library and
faculty finances.

As always there are innumerable
factors involved, and as_ students
speaking from dedicated ignorance,
we must make allowance for the un-
knowns. The library and faculty salar-
ies are under perpetual improvement.
They have simply not yet fallen vic-
tims to a “erash program.” The rea-
sons for this range from the fact that
these projects do not lend themselves
to spectacular crashing programs to
the other type of fact that things are
steadily, if slowly, improving, to the
other fact that even the present allot-
ments for new books are not always
used up by the professors concerned.

Activities Of Worth

The term “extracurricular” cov-
ers a wide range of activity. From the
football field to the student council
meeting, this term refers to the or-
ganized effort which dllows the in-
dividual to refine and complete the
educational experience.

Many times these activities pro-
duce results which are considered
beneficial to the whole college com-
munity. Participation and reco. d
excellence in extracurriculars is fre-
quently motivated and rewarded by
scholarships. Extracurriculars are
thus recognized to be beneficial on
the same basis as academic excellence.

Monetary recognition of achieve-.

Eloi, Eloi

Something that draws up the col-
lege calendar has a grudge against the
Crucifixion, for year after year. Dav-
idson students are herded into class-
rooms on Good Friday.

We realize that most students
couldn't care less, although they
wouldn’t object to another holiday.
But there are some who find this
strangely inconsistent in a church-
related institution.

Davidson is associated with the
Presbyterian Church, an mstitution
which recognizes Good Friday as a
rather special day. But alas, Davidson
students who attend the Good Friday
services are given no credit for good
works, but rather big bad cuts. ©

It would, of course, be too simple
a solution to include Good Friday or
Holy Week in the Spring Vacation. It

Noted In Passing

@ Right now there is a festering
menace off our shores that is ever
seeking to spread subversion through-
out this land. The councils of war are
in session and the predators have met.
The balance of power is shifting. . . .

Yes, off the shores of that man-
made lake called Norman, a godless

hilosophy is taking its cancerous

old. In the stagnant waters of back-
eddies and semi-swamps, untroubled
by any foul chemical, the barbaric
mosquito gleefully plots for that mas-
sive blitzkreig.

When? When we are weakest.
Spring Frolics. Or when we are grip-
ped by creeping sunbathing.

What can we mortals do? As we
see it, the Davidson family has two
choices. We can all drive our cars
out to the shores of the lake and drain
oil on the troubled waters. (Plenty of
parking space out there.) The best

(Need we suggest the advisability of a
little pressure on the indolent from
above as well as on students below?)

But the questions still remain as
to whether or not Davidson ought to
burn up so much energy for the Union
and Lake Norman, at this particular
time. The projects in themselves are
commendable if not sorely needed,
but how do these needs stack up
against other more specifically aca-
demic needs for an improved library
and faculty?

We want to see Davidson headed
towards greater academic excellence.
After all, it is a college, if not a good
college, and, as Dean Burts pointed
out at the first of the year, not a
country club. We wonder if we are
now on the shortest and quickest
route towards that excellence. In other
words, are we going to get caught on
the beach when the barbarians come
crashing in?

ment in extracurriculars is limited to
athletics at Davidson. And since the
field of beneficial activities is not this
limited, we think the administration
should investigate the possibility of
giving scho! ps to leaders in these

activities.

We would specifically suggest
that scholarships established for
the president of the Student Council
and the editor of THE DAVIDSONIAN.
These are two of the most active and
onsible positions on campus. The
Organizations involved are certainly
. two of the most vital student activities.

Perhaps even as vital as athletics.

would be futile. But could someone
not arrange it for students to attend
the Good Friday services in Davidson
without suffering the penalties of the
cut system?

On the other hand, the present
policy is uniquely appropriate. For
Christ was crucified in relative ob-
scurity, and left to hang before pass-
ers-by. The followers who were pres-
ent were there at their own risk. So,
it is fitting that Davidson too passes
by its own professed reason for exist-
ing, bumbling on its way with the rest
of the pagan world, with no time for
fanatics.

Yes, it is fitting, almost too fit-
ting a commentary on something,
somewhere.

JKA

thing, however, is for the administra-
tion to act positively in this matter.
The entire campus and Hatties
must be enveloped under a giant mos-
quito net. We demand a protective
uarantine! Surely our bodies deserve
e same protection that our spirits
get! We must hurry though. Spring is
upon us and soon Nature will hold al!
the cards. . .

WE ARE WAITING for parking
lines to be moved closer.

Students are never satisfied with

e food. At Wake Forest the editor-

jals are critical of their systemized

food. We hear of mass food poisonings

at V.P.I. And of course we have prob-
lems too.

We have figured out that the only
solution to the universal problem is
to hand out individual pre-heated
cans. With sterlized can openers.

Playboy’s Researchers

The U. S. college man has
been profiled in a recent -stud-
ent survey by Pleyboy.

He is 20.6 years ‘old. Twelve
chances out of a hundred, he is
married. He spent. $68 in re-
furbishing his back-to-campus
wardrobe. It's an even bet that
he owns or has full-time use of
an automobile. He makes.a-point
of being well-greomed and has
already accumulated much of
the gear of the good life.

He is Jee Coffege, T9853.

A mass of brand new informa-
tion about the nation of ‘male
undergraduates is revealed in a
new study, “Male College Stud
ent Survey.” conducted by the
research firm, Benn Manage-
ment .Corporation, in coopera-
tion with the Market Research
Department of Playboy maga-
zine. Involving a sample size of
12,100 mail questionnaires, the
survey results are based on
final returns from more fhan
5,000 male students from 72
U.S. colleges and universities.

The survey shows that 11.2%
of today’s male students are
married. 11.8% of today’s under
graduates underwrite al! of
their college expenses. while
17.2% do not contribute at all
to their colltge support. 62.4%
live on campus. 22.4°: off cam-
pus but not. with their families.
and 15.2% reside off campus
with their families. 29.3°: be-
long to a social fraternity.

As to outside jobs. the study
shows that 52.8% work during
summer only. while 30.3% work
both during the summer and
schoo! vear. 14.6% do not work
at all.

How dependent are today’s
college students on the automo-

bile? The survey shows that
36.7% possess their own cars
while 10.7% have full-time per-
sonal use of one. While Decem-
ber was still early in the cur-
rent model year, 2.7% already
drive a 1963 automobile, 10.7%
-a 19862 model, 84% a 1961
model and 7.6% a 1960 model.
When asked ebout slechelic
‘beverage consumption, 66.8%
vot all mele undergreduates
responded affirmatively. Mere-
cover, 0.5% drink beer, 25.3%
twine, 50% liquor.

60.4% of all male college stud-
cents surveyed answered that
they smoked: 41.8% cigarettes,
‘11.9% cigars and 14.8% pipes.
-Among cigarette smokers, filter
types were the favorite, with
the total sample showing 66.8%
preferring this kind of a cigar-
ette. 14.5% smoke king size,
while 22.3% smoke _ regular.
Cigar smokers prefer panatella
shapes with 33.3%. while 22.5%
liked cigarillos, 193% blunts
and 15.9% tip ends. Of pipe
‘smokers, 44.9% said that they
smoked five or less pipefuls
during the week preceding the
survey. The median price for
their last pound of tobacco pur-
chased was $2.30.

That today’s college man is
far from the “beatnik” type is
shown oy the high use of per-
sonal grooming aids. 83.6% use
after-shave lotions. 72.8%. sham-
poo: 69.3%, hair dressing:
41.4%, cologne and 38.1%, pow-
der or tale. The survey also
specifies what percent of stud-
ents used each of the products
“yesterday.” For example, 91.3%
used a deodorant, of whom
9827 used it “yesterday.”

While the median expenditure

for back-to-school wardrobes in
1962 was $68.07, 32% spent over
$100 and 8.7% over $200. The
typical student wardrobe con-
sists of 2.6 suits, 2 sports jac-
kets, 6.5 pairs of slacks, 3.8 pairs
of shoes, 6.2 dress shirts, 10
Sport shirts, 1.1 topeoats or over-
coats, 1.4 other winter coats, 9
raincoats, .7 dress hats, 4.7
sweaters, 6.3 ties, 2.7 belts, 14.6
pairs of socks, 10 undershirts,
10.5 pairs of undershorts.

As te home entertainment,
off-campus end encampus,
49% own recerd players,
16.9%, tape recorders; 63.1%,
table model radios; 165%,
television sets. tn addition,
53.1% own transistor or port-
able radios.

17.9% awn 35 mm cameras;
8.7%; movie cameras; 6%, Polar-
oid cameras; 6.2% slide projec-
tors and 8.7%, movie projectors.
Typewriters are owned by
59.3%, wrist, watches by 88.9%
and fountain pens by 81.6%.

Questioned as to what maga-
zine they read “regularly” (try
to read every issue), 34.5% said
Playboy, 33.3% Life, 29.5%
Time, 25.1% Saturday Evening
Post and 21.1% Sports illustrat-
ed. Asked to list their “first
favorite” magazine, 13.3% an-
swered Playboy; 12.3%, Time;
8.9%, Life; 8.1%, Sports Ilus-
trated and 6.6%, Seturday Eve-
ning Post.

The study results also reflect
complete characteristics of
Playboy campus readers versus
non-read:rs. The introduction
to the Benn questionnaire says,
“You are one of a limited num-
ber of students . .. "- Wonder
how many Davidson gentlemen
were so honored?

Summer Positions Offer
More Than Just Money

BY BILL REINY

College students should no
longer feel that a summer job
is just employment to fill in 2
breathing space. The interested

student can obtain a position in
which he can gain experience in
and knowledge of the problem
areas of our nation as well as
those of other nations.

In fact, it appears that the
student can find employment to
meet almost any interest he
might have if only he begins
early enough and is not easily
discouraged. Some of the possi-
ble opportunities in. the area of
social problems deserve atten-
tion.

The American Friends Service
Committee sponsors numerous
work and study projects during
the summer, including several
in North Carolina. A Citizenship
Education Project will be held
this summer in Warren and
Franklin counties to assist
Negro leaders in setting up a
series of workshops. Also, a
voter registration project. in
Greensboro is scheduled for late
summer.

Other proposed projects in-
clude work with the mentally

itt and retarded, and with
juvenite offenders. in addi-
tion, projects are planned in
about twenty-five foreign
countries. Financial cemun-
eration is received for some
of the jobs.

For one who is interested in
the problems of the urban areas
many opportunifies are avail-

able. Many social work agencies
sponsor summer camps working
with children from the slums
and employ students with the
expressed purpose of training
them for the work involved.

Some churches such as Judson
Memorial Church in New York
City sponsor Church and Urban
Life projects in which students
are aided in securing employ-
ment in businesses and shops in
addition to participating in sem-
inars with experts on various
aspects of problems they en-
counter. Other organizations
sponsor projects. of a similar
nature in which the participant
receives a direct experience in
an area of vital concern.

As many are aware, there are

LETTER
Logan

Dear Editor:

The last words I heard Dr.
George Schweitzer speak were,
“Invite me back, will you?”
That was at his Tuesday night
forum on “Science and Genesis,”
which had run overtime from
the stream of questions asked
him. And the stream was still
flowing strongly from the most
interested audience I've seen on
this campus. I hope that Dr.
Schweitzer will be asked to re-
turn soon to help some more in
making us more nearly whole
men.

many projects scheduled deal-
ing with the problem areas in
foreign countries. As mentioned
above the AFSC sponsors pro-
jects in several nations includ-
ing the Soviet Union.

The Board of World Missions
of Presbyterian Church U.S. has
considered the possibility of
sponsoring projects for students
in foreign countries, but at pres-
ent limits its summer program
to the sending of 10 to 15 stud-
ents to work at the mission sta-
tions. It should be noted that
they appear to be especially in-
terested in pre-medical students
with adequate language prepara-
tion to assist in the mission hos-
pitals. As one would expect, the
money to be received for such
employment is limited. But may-
be. money is not the desirable
end for all activity.

All in all, a college student
should not have the attitude
that because he is 9 student
he must remain aloof from di-
rect participation in areas of
vital concern to ail people. He
can deal first hand with the
crises of race, social welfare,
urban renewal, family disin-
tegration, undeveloped na-
tions, ete.

Information on summer work
projects can be obtained from
Will Terry. It may be very dif.
ficult and very troublesome to
fill out applications, but the
possible experience to be deriv-
ed from the emploment might
be invaluable to one searching
to find his niche in life.

BY ALEX WUSTMANN
Richerdson Scholar

There has been much discus-
sion about the recent “Black
Day of Europe’: analysis and
forecasts filled the newspapers,
an immediate biography of
troublemaker General De Gaulle
was sent to every home by TV.
After wading through all this,
everybody in the USA feels in-
sulted. They feel that the Veto
of Brussels was practically ag-
gression against them. This is
too much!

General De Gaulle has two
weak points. First, he doesn’t
like the British and thought that
the French Veto would finally
decide, to the favor of France,
the silent battle about who has
the most important voice in
Europe. Second, he is a typical
Frenchman, and, during his
speeches, when he touches every
listener by the fascinating glory
and importance of France, he
probably would like to change
his first name Charles to Napo-
leon.

But he forgets the differ-
ence between Napoleon and
him: Napoleon had the might-
iest army in Europe and De
Gaulle, on the contrary, is
equipped with en impotent
nuclear force that cannot in
the least startle the Russian
beer.

The Nassau agreement be-
tween President Kennedy and
Prime Minister MacMillan dis
appointed De Gaulle very much.
Here Great Britain accepted. the
American Polaris missiles, for
she believed it would strengthen
her defensive power. Thus
France saw first plece in Eu-
rope, which she had claimed,
disappear for the sake of Great
Britain.

But in recent days we have
seen that significant diplomacy
eminates less from Paris than
from Washington. Once again
America took the position as the

leader of the Western world, as
she renewed atomic
tests after fruitless talks with
the Soviets.

A surprising statement was
also issued that the United

Nuclear -

States is willing to give up its -

bases in Turkey and southern
‘Italy because through the Polar.
is submarines they have become
useless. But other bases remain
still around the neck of the
Soviets, beginning with the
Arctic, Greenland, Iceland,
Great Britain, France, Germany.
Italy, Greece, and along the
Asian border to Formosa and
Japan.

Ot is vy opinion thet Presi-
dent Kennedy does net give
this gift te the Soviets of
abandoning the Turkey beses
because ef the Cuban question
but because of his grand de-
sign, thet the European na-
tions should defend them-
selves as strongly es possible
and should not only rely on
Americen super-weapons.

So the European Unity is
nowadays more important than
ever. General De Gaulle should
remember that Khrushchev once
stated that in a war he would

blow out Germany like a candle.’

A solitary France wouldn't be
any better off. The German-
French treaty, after centuries
of dispute and hatred, is out-
standing and a great tribute to
De Gaulle and Adenauer, whose
lifework seems to be fullfilled.
However, compared to the prob-
lem of European Integration it
is only secondary. Europe needs
Great Britain and it needs a

Common Market with England ©

as a partner.

I am sure that the “Black Day
of Brussels” was only a momen-
tary crisis and that General De
Gaulle will wake up very soon
and forget his sweet, but danger.
ous dream. That is, if he wants
to avoid this dream changing to
a nightmare.

Cole Explains R le
Of Union On Campus

BY BEN COLE
College Union President

We call it the College Union,
not the Student Union as you
may have often heard, because
the Union is the whole college
at once. It embraces students,
faculty, administration, alumni,
and friends—the whole college
as a family unit. It offers us a
place to meet, to eat, to work, to
play, and to just relax. But the
Union is more than just a place.
It is an integration of the total
campus life in which the many
phases of study and play are
biended together.

At Davidson our College
Union constantly tries to fulfill
these goals. It makes available
Student organization offices,
meeting rooms, work space,
lounge and game facilities, a
student store, cafeteria and ca-
tering service, bookstore, and a
ballroom-theater.

One arm of the Union or-
ganization is the student board
of committee chairmen with
the president of the Union at
its head. Working together
within the Union, the board
attempts to serve the campus
by offering what it calls a
“program”. This program in-
volves recognizing our needs
as students, professors, and
friends of the College and at-

tempting fo organize and pre-
sent a series of projects to
help these needs.

This work is done by 10 com-
mittees: Roundtable, Social,
Film, Bookshelf, Music, Recrea-
tion and Games. Special Fea-
tures, House, Publicity, and dis-
play. Working in separate areas,
the committees attempt to fill
in and round out Davidson extra-
curricular life. During the year
there are annual projects like
films, tournaments, orientation,
the Christmas party, and the
Spring Auction.

But one of the most important
roles of the Union board is to
try to give day-to-day leisure-
time entertainment for students,
faculty, and staff. This is partly
accomplished by programs like
receptions, coffee hours, reviews
of the news, and fashion shows.
Another way the Union offers
recognition for members of the

campus family is through dis-.

plays and posters. Most import-
ant, it offers a meeting ground
for faculty, administration, and
students where ideas may be
shared and friendships strength-
ened.

Our Union really tries, in
short, to be for us a campus
“living room” the place
where we, the college family,
work and play together in an at-
tempt to express ourselves and
to grow to our greatest extent.
