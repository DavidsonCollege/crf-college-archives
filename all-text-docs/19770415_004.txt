SGA’s Office of Academic

Affairs has completed the
faculty evaluation it began
last spring.
s Bob Brown, Chairperson of
Academic Affairs, said the
evaluation will be made avail-
able to students before regis-
tration for fall semester.

Brown thinks the evaluation
will ‘‘have a really positive
effect’’. He added that many
teachers ‘‘will be pleasantly
surprised’”’ by the high scores
they received.

‘tnas was done for the

Outside Perspe

benefit of the students,’’ said
Brown. He feels existing eval-
uations within various depart-
ments serve the department
and not the students register-
ing for courses, per se.

The evaluation has met
some opposition from faculty
members. Faculty members
did. not consent to SGA'’s
original proposal, which would
have distributed the question-
naire in class, Instead, it was
distributed in the Student
Union.

Brown speculated that some
faculty members opposed the
evaluation because ‘‘I think
they were a little bit intimi-
dated...But I don’t think any-
body’s going to be fired be-
cause of it.”’

Faculty Evaluation

Academic Affairs hopes the
evaluation will help students
evaluate’ teachers before tak-
ing courses under them. They
also hope department chair-
persons will use the informa-
tion “for the overall improve-
ment of the department.”

In addition, they want the
information to help faculty
members evaluate their own
performances.

Brown said Academic Af-
fairs obtained copies of other
schools’ evaluation question-
naires, and the results of those
questionnaires. Universities
and colleges contacted inclu-
ded North Carolina State Uni-
versity, Clemson, UNC-Cha-
pel Hill, Clemson, Duke and
Harvard.

Not that water isn’t important to a beers taste.

Is. Very important.
But the fact is, virtually all brewers filter

and further purify their brewing water.

And Schlitz doesn’t stop there. They put their
water through what they believe is the most
sophisticated purifying process of any brewer

Club sports plans
expanded future

By PHILIP DUNCAN
News Editor

The Council on Club Sports
(CSC) has completed ppelimi-
nary organizational work and
is initiating efforts to expand
the scope of the Club Sports
program and publicize its act-
ivities.

Sophomore Ron Rosenberg,
President of CSC, explained
the evolution of the Council’s
efforts.

“This fall the CSC drew up a
constitution, by-laws, and
budget. The Council on Cam-
pus and Religious Life and
College President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr., approved our
plans.

“The Council spent a lot of
time going over the projected
budgets drawn up by the
heads of each sport, and we
requested only what we really
needed,” said Rosenberg.

‘‘Then we went before the
Activities Tax Council with
our request for funding. They
didn’t think our request was
exorbitant, and granted us
$3000 for all the club sports
next year.

“The program will never be
totally dependent on the col-
lege for money —the members
pay at least half of the costs of
running their clubs—but the
$3000 will help out a lot,’’ he
said.

Rosenberg explained that
part of the $3000 would help
offset costs of renovating and
replacing equipment, and for
referees’ salaries.

Rosenberg outlined some of
the Council’s other plans.

“T plan to appoint a member
on the committee to put
together a pamphlet on David-

son’s Club Sports program for
the general information of the
student body. It could also be
useful for the Admissions
Office. _

“We will try to organize a
workshop on how to run a club
sport. We hope to pool our
knowledge and cooperate with
the Athletic Department,’’
said Rosenberg.

As a future goal, Rosenberg
hopes to work with the Ath-
letic Department to allow the
Club Sports and all students
access to the training room
facilities.

“We want to coordinate the
scheduling of games to avoid
conflicts,’’ said Rosenberg.

There are six club sports
teams— football, lacrosse,
rugby, ice hockey, soccer, and
skiing, and an affiliate water
polo team.

“After a period of time we
will examine the managerial
and financial responsibility of
the new water polo team and
decide whether they will be-
come a full member.

‘‘We have about 100-150
people participating in club
sports, and there could be a lot
more. :

‘Each sport has a dedicated
core of participants, many of
whom are freshmen. If these
dedicated freshmen retain
their interest year after year,
and we add new members each
year, we will soon have strong
teams in every sport,’’ Rosen-
berg concluded.

The Club Sports Council is
made up of representatives
from each club sport, a stu-
dent-at-large, Director of Phy-
sical Education Sterling Mar-
tin, and Assistant Dean of
Students Mary Lou Dietler.
