The Davidson baseball team
rebounded from two tough losses
to Western Carolina to soundly
defeat Pfeiffer this week during
their final stages of preparation for
the Southern Conference tourna-
ment this weekend.

The miserable weather late
last week must have been an omen
that the Catamounts of Western
Carolina were going to rain of the
Wildcats’ parade last weekend.
Davidson was riding a five-game
winning streak and had their
sights set on being the Southern
Division’s number one seed at the
upcoming tournament. The
Wildcats needed to beat Western
Carolina two out of two or three
out of three games (depending on

the weather) to unseat the
Catamounts from their first-place
position.

Western Carolina got out of
the blocks early by scoring eight
runs in the top of the second in-
ning. They also added four in the
third, and one each in the fifth and
sixth frames. Davidson found
themselves in a hole, but soon
their bats were heard from. Senior
catcher Dan Simonds put the Cats
on the scoreboard in the fourth in-
ning by clubbing a three-run
homer. Mark Thompson added a
solo shot later in the inning. In the

fifth inning, Brian Moure and
Simonds hit back-to-back home-
runs: Moure’s was a two-run wal-
lop to right field; Simonds’ was a
solo drive to left field. After six

complete innings, | Western
Carolina led 14-7. Davidson
mounted a comeback in the bot-
tom of the. seventh inning when

Dave DePaul hit his eleventh”

round- tripper of the year which
came with two men on base. But
the Catamount lead was insur-
mountable, and Western Carolina
won the first game of the doub-
leheader 14-10.

Western Carolina jumped out
to the early lead in game two later
that afternoon on a two-run homer
in the top of the first inning. But
Davidson’s Alan Lewis belted his
eleventh dinger of the year to cut
the Catamount lead .to 2-1. The
Catamounts added another single
run in the third inning, but the big
blow came in the fifth inning on a
grand slam which put Western
Carolina up by the score of 7-1.
Davidson could only muster one
more run when Thompson walked
with the bases loaded scoring
Lewis. Western Carolina added
one more run in the seventh and
won 8-2.

Earlier this week the weather

took a.turn.for the better, and so _

did Davidson’s good fortune. The

Cats took out their frustrations on
the visiting Pfeiffer Falcons as
they pounded thirteen hits, result-
ing in a 10-5 win. Davidson’s big
inning came in the third when they
sent fourteen batters to the plate
and scored eight runs. Simonds
rapped a triple up the left-center
alley plating three runners to blow
the game wide open. Besides
Simonds, Dave Turgeon, Dave
DePaul, George Halter, and Bill
Masse all had RBIs in the inning.
Moure took the Pfeiffer pitcher
downtown in the sixth frame, and
Simonds’ double inthe eighth in-
ning scoring Turgeon for David-
son’s other scores. Pitchers Jeff
Loser, Greg Wilcox, and Charlie
Winborne combined for
Davidson win with Wilcox getting
credit for the victory.

Hopefully, Wednesday’s
drubbing of Pfeiffer got the Cats
back on track as they head into the
Southern Conference Tourney
this weekend. At 3 pm today they
play Appalachian State (22-6
overall, 10-2 in SC), the number
one seed from the northern divi-
sion. The  double-elimination
tournament, which also includes
Western Carolina and VMI, is
scheduled to end on Sunday. The
winner gets an automatic berth in
the NCAA tournament to be held

the .

later this spring. There is also a
chance that a second Southern

Conference team might receive an
at-large bid to participate as well.
Last year, conference champion
Western Carolina as well as Ap-
palachian State made it to post-
season play. :

For the Record Book: Bill
Masse is leading the SOuthern

Conference in hitting at a .419
clip... . Davidson boasts the
top four home run hitters in the
conference: Turgeon and Masse
have 12 each, while Lewis and
DePaul have 11 apiece. . . . The
1987 team has set an all-time re-
cord for home runs in a season.
They. currently have 69 round-
trippers on the year.

Sports here at Davidson and around the world _

BARRON

With so much going on in the world
of sports, both at and away from David-
son, confining myself to one topic
seemed an unnecessary torture. As I des-
pise even mental cruelty, I have granted
myself a reprieve and will wander seem-
ingly without purpose across the wide
world of sports.

If-you’re a hockey fan I hope you saw
The Game over the Easter weekend. Last
Saturday night the New York Islanders
outlasted the Washington Capitals 4-3 in
game seven of their best-of-seven playoff
series in a game that took more than three
periods of sudden death play to determine
a winner. The game offered a clinic in
superior goal-tending and showed some
great athletes giving everything they had
for the team. And that’s what sports is all“
about, isn’t it? As the two teams lined up.

to shake hands, I’m not sure who was
happier, the Islanders for winning, or the
Capitals for having all the time they
needed to recover.

_ While major league baseball stood in
collective awe at the 13-Game winning
streak strung together by the Milwaukee
Brewers, the Davidson baseball team
finished second in their division to qual-
ify for this weekend’s conference cham-
pionships. Unfortunately for Davidson,
this year will be the last for Coach George
Greer, who announced this week he will
coach at Wake Forest starting next sea-
son. Greer has taken a program that had
nothing five years ago and made it into a
perennial conference contender that cur-
rently sports half a dozen potential major
league draft picks come end of the sea-
son. I wish Coach Greer the best of luck
in the future.

Speaking of coaches leaving, I guess
someone needs to address the strange
topic of basketball coach Bobby Hus-
sey’s possible departure. When. Matt
“The Voice of Davidson Baseball”
Newsom announced at a baseball game
that Hussey had withdrawn his name

from consideration for the Toledo coach-
ing job, the proclamation met with claps
from two alumni, but curiosity from the
student fans: none of the students seemed
to be able to decide if this was good or
bad news. If you’re reading, Coach Hus-
sey, I think a bit of public relations are in
order, Get out there and high-five those
crazy students who consistently succeed
in imitating a Nuremberg rally for every
Johnston Gym extravaganza. .

I guess since we are in “Metrolina” I
should mention the NBA granting Char-
lotte a franchise. I know a lot of people in
Charlotte are happy and I don’t want to
rain on their parade, but the NBA is bor-
ing until the playoffs and Charlotte won’t
be in the playoffs for a long, long time.
Just ask the Pacers, Clippers or Warriors
how tough it is to make the playoffs.

For all you golfers inspired by Larry
Mize’s incredible chip to win the Masters
I have an important announcement. In
honor of his fiftieth class reunion this
weekend, golf-course czar Howard
Covington will award $100 to anyone
who hits a hole-in-One at Covington Na-
tional this weekend. Of course you have

have any plans this weekend, I’m pleased

to be a.member of his graduating class to
qualify, but money or not, you can bet I'll
be out there hacking away all weekend.
No Auburn students allowed.

On the IMAC front, the story of the
spring so far has to be the confrontation
between junior pitcher Andrea Dietrich
and junior basketball star Dean Keener.
Dietrich struck out Keener not once, but
twice. Keener came back strong, how-
ever, by popping up to the centerfielder
his next time up to bat. When the fielder
dropped the easy out, Keener burned
around the basepaths at such a blinding
pace he lapped a teammate forced to tag-
up at the potential fly out. Keener goes
down as one of the few people to ever fly-
out into a double-play.

Finally, for those of you who don’t

to announce the First Annual Malcolm
Partin Tanning Contest. Dr. Partin, in an
attempt to get students “beyond the pale”
for future beach trips, has decided to
sponsor this contest as inspiration to lose
that winter white. For more details, con-
tact Dr. Partin in his office.

Men’s Tennis. The Cats had a
relatively quiet week as they'con-
zentrated on practicing for this
weekend’s conference tourna-
ment at V.M.I. The only action
they saw was a singles only tilt

against U.S.C. on Tuesday, in
which the strong (Gamecocks

swept all six matches. The diffi-
cult competition should help. the
Cats in their quest for the confer-
ence championship.

Basketball. Seniors Ace Tan-
ner and Chris Heineman have
been participating all this month
in an Atlantic Coast Conference

barnstorming tour. The players
have been holding their own with
some of the top performers in the
country, including such notables
as Kenny Smith and Horace
Grant.
Wildcat Athlete of the
Week. This week's Bryant-Wilks
athlete of the week is junior tennis

player Amy, McNelis. This past
weekend, Amy made it all the way

to the Southern Conterence
Championship before bowing out.
Congratulations Amy on an im-
pressive performance and_ good
luck for continued success this
summer.

In search of .. . If.anyone
could tell me why there is that sign
on the third hole of Covington Na-
tional which reads “Home of the
Wildcats” I would truly appreciate
it. It seems to me that the sign
would be better used if it was

turned around to face the baseball
field.
