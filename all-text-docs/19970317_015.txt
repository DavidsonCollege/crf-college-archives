The challenge for next year’s
team will be to do the same.

There will be a surplus of ca-

problem will be solved by a most
capable coach. (See this week’s
Cubby.)

headed by Donnelly. His shot

“I’m real excited about next
year,” said Billy Armstrong after
the Chattanooga loss.

Indeed, the framework for a
Southern Conference champion has
already been laid by this year’s
squad, which succeeded by win-

Armstrong improved steadily with
each game and Davor Halbauer

play without losing his ability to

The frontcourt is also crowded
despite the departure of all-confer-

with Chadd Holmes, who had per-
haps his finest effort of the season
in the tournament finale. David

can be a potent offensive threat.

another full year of practice - into

cupboard. He has already signed
two recruits, 6-10 center Brian
Allenspach of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.,
and 6-4 swingman Emeka Erege of
Long Island, N.Y. There is talk of
a third signee in the near future.

year’s squad could carry Davidson
to its first conference tourney title
and NCAA berth since 1986.

Chattanooga loses four critical
seniors and runner-up Marshall de-
parts for the Mid-American Con-
ference.

That, along with their
motherload of returning talent,
opens the door for the Wildcats.

“Tf the team has the same char-

acter, it’s going to bé great,”

Donnelly predicted. “The only thing
we were lacking this year was expe-
rience and that’s one thing we’re
definitely going to have next-year.”

Davidson will again face a na-
tionally competitive non-confer-
ence schedule, including home
games against Wake Forest and
UMass and road dates at UNC Char- |

“We just tried to take Donnelly
and Ewodo away and live with the
rest of them.”

Despite a combined one point
from the targeted duo, the Wildcats
trailed at halftime by only two, 31-
29, as coach Bob McKillop’s no-
star system based on balance and
depth nearly foiled Chattanooga’s
masterplan.

Chadd Holmes led Davidson
with 18 points and six rebounds arid
Landry Kosmalski added 17 and
nine, as the Wildcats shot a respect-
able .464 from the field, out-re-
bounded the more muscular Mocs,
and compiled 19 assists to only 12
turnovers.

And after, consecutive three-
pointers by Donnelly and Ewodo
with three minutes left, the Moc
lead, which had been as high as 12
midway through the second half,
stood at just 59-56.

But Chattanooga made 16 of
its 20 free throws down the stretch
to seal aspotin Sunday’ s title game.

’ Ultimately, it was the Mocs’
legitimate talent - and not any par-
ticularly glaring Davidson deficien-
cies - that made the difference in
this tight, well-played Southern
showdown.

“Their performance was cham-
pionship caliber,” praised McKillop
in the postgame press conference.

“Without a doubt, this was, one of
the finest games played against us
this year.”

The Mocs shot a sizzling .585
from the floor - including an un-
characteristically high clip from
three-point land - and seemed to
always have an answer to every
Davidson challenge.

The Chattanooga backcourt of
Willie Young and Wes Moore frus-
trated the Wildcats the entire game,
scoring 27 and 15 points, respec-
tively. :

Center Chris Mims struck fora
quiet 13, while league Player-of-
the- Year Johnny Taylor was held to
only 10.

“When Johnny gets in trouble
offensively, we’ve got to pick it up
offensively,” explained Young.
“We have great outside shooters
and we have great penetrators.
Myself and Wes can penetrate into
the middle and dish it outside to
some open shooters so they can get
their shot.”

“T was surprised they came out
and lit it up early like they did,”
admitted McKillop, referring to the
four threes made by Young, Moore,
and Isaac Conner in a two-minute
span early in the first half and 6-for-
11 shooting from behind the arc
overall. “When Johnny Taylor is
limited to 10 points, it just shows
how talented this team is.”

STATESBORO, Ga. — Like
three-and-two, two outs, bottom of
the ninth, it was a scene straight out
of a hackneyed Hollywood sports
melodrama.

Carolyn Kirsch - senior star,
team leader, the Southern

Commentary

Conference’s top scorer and Player-
of-the- Year, owner of virtually ev-
ery Wildcat women’s basketball
record of any significance - stood at
the free throw line with an opportu-
nity to breathe renewed life into a
team and program she helped build.

Kirsch, in a frenzied attempt to
tie the game at 73 with a layup, was
fouled as time expired, setting up a
hideously simple scenario: make
both foul shots or call it a game, a
season, a career.

There was no middle ground,
second chance, ornext time. All the
factors that go into either winning

will be forgotten, CK will not

or losing basketball were rendered
irrelevant. The fine line between
victory and defeat had never been
so fine.

Make or miss. Win or lose.

“Without CK and what she’s
done, we’re not even there, we’re
noteven in that position,” saidcoach
John Filar after the game: “Who
else do you want on the line?”

Truthfully, no one. It was so
very appropriate.

Because there was no time left,
the other nine players were called to
their respective benches. It was just
Kirsch. Very rarely does a game of
such magnitude rest on only one set
of shoulders. Very rarely does a
team game become so horribly in-
dividualistic.

Georgia Southern’s bench was
a picture of anticipation. The faces
down the Wildcat sideline showed
an odd mixture of hope and horror.

Football players - imposing in
every sense of the word - who
seemed to make up a vast majority
of the crowd of 528, ran up and
down the walkway behind the bas-
ket. The noise was stifling - about
as loud as 528 people could ever be.

Kirsch dribbled the ball,
stopped and took a deep breath.
Davidson women’s basketball’s all-
time leader in free throws and free
throws attempted set to take at least
one more.

Kirsch, battling nothing but the
basket and nerves. Such moments
are why we love sports and why we
hate sports, all rolled into one. It
was real.

And for the women’s basket-
ball team, a bit too real, as CK’s first
attempt caromed off the right side
of the rim and fell helplessly to the
floor.

The refs looked at each other
for a few agonizing seconds and
then blew their whistles. On the
game, the season, and the most
magnificent career in the history of
women’s basketball at Davidson
College.

“She’s a class player,” said
Lady Eagle coach Rusty Cram.
“You’ve got to feel for an athlete
like that. You hate for the game to
come down to that when somebody
misses like that. For someone of
her caliber, she’ ll never forget that
shot.”

Maybe. But personally, I just
hope CK never forgets everything
else she did for Davidson and its
women’s basketball program dur-
ing her four years here,

In today’s what-have-you-
done-for-me-lately world where the
last thing one does is remembered
most, it is indeed a shame CK’s
storied career had to come to a teary
end in a steamy Statesboro, Ga.,
gym.

And the fact is, every women’s
hoops player who comes to
Davidson will be, from here on out,
compared to Carolyn Kirsch. She
has set a standard of winning in a
program thathad grown accustomed
to losing.

Her career was one of glory,
but also one of dirty work. She took
the program from Southern Confer-
ence doldrums to a viable striking
position. And when the Wildcats
do eventually strike - in the form of
a league title and NCAA berth -
fans will remember the efforts of
Carolyn Kirsch.

And that’s a can’t-miss guar-
antee. ,

47 cushion with 7:37 remaining.

“While we played a very good
first half, they (Davidson) just
played better in the second half,”
said Citadel coach Pat Dennis. “We
got behind early and had to play
catch-up the rest of the way.”

Ewodo struggled in Davidson’s
only other meeting with the Bull-
dogs, 263-58 Wildcat victory, scor-
ing a season-low four points.

“They did a good job in our
first meeting taking me out of the
game,” said the senior forward.
“Today I followed the scouting re-
port our coaches provided and let
things come to me.”

But the quaterfinal win was not
about personal accolades, it was a
balanced team effort executed al-
most to perfection.

“Things really came together
today,” said McKillop. “We were
effective in all aspects of the game .
- defensively, from the line, and in
transition - and we got contribu-
tions from several players. Overall,
a solid team win.”

until he has accomplished everything
there is to accomplish.

But what, exactly, is that at a
tiny Southern Conference institution
like Davidson? An NCAA bid? An
NCAA win? A Sweet 16 appear-
ance? Hell, how about a spot in the
Elite Eight?

“I wouldn’t be sitting here if I
thought that was impossible,”
McKillop said last week in his neatly-
kempt office, surrounded by pictures
of his wife and kids.

Some might call that blind faith.
I call it supreme confidence - in him-
self, his players, and his system.

There is pressure on next year’s
team. Already. After having its
NCAA berth wrenched away by
Western Carolina last year and anear-
miss against Chattanooga in this
year’s league semis, anything short
of an NCAA bid next year would be
a letdown.

This program has gotten good to
the point where NCAA berths have
become the guage for success.

“T welcome that pressure,” said
the man whose team will put
Davidson’s name in front of the pub-
lic eye. “I hope people do pick us.
We need to be able to deal with pres-
sure.

“This is a twelve-month mis-
sion. I think this is going to be one of
the most productive off-seasons
Davidson basketball has ever had.
We want to be playing this time next
year, not watching. And itbegins this
week.”
