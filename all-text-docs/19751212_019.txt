IFT bombs KA for flickerball crown

By THOM BLACKWOOD
and
KIRK COMBE

Once upon a time and a
very good time it was, there
was a moo-cow coming down
along the road and this moo-
cow that was coming down
along the road met a nicens
(sic) little boy named baby
Robbie Tuchoo...and he made
a nicens little interception on
the goal line and moved down
along the road.

Imagine you’re there. The
same four finalists as last
year, awsome talent, friendly
competition, bodies lurching,
lunging, sprinting, and oc-
casionally two SPE’ ’s running

into each other.

IFT floated by mountain-
tops while the others. battled
in the valley. The SPE’s,
KA’s, and SAE’s scrounged
for second place.

No, the SAE’s were left
behind as the KA’s and the
SPE’s floundered for a chance
to compete with the Thighs
(sorry Hose, there’s no ac-
counting for talent).

In the first round SAE was
stifled by the iron defense of
IFT, 38-13, while the precision
plays of the KA’s moved with
a surgeon’s skill down the field
to defeat the SPE’s, a lot to
not quite enough.

That pitted the offensive
machine of KA against the

pin, the fastest of the tourney.

Scott was defeated twice by
the same wrestler from The
Citadel, and, like Dulany, he
will have a chance to atone for
his loss later in the season.

Coach Rader expects these
two freshmen to be outstand-
ing performers on this year’s
team. He expects Phillips ‘‘to
be extremely tough when he
gets into better shape,” and,
he adds, “Dulany can’t get
much tougher than he already
is.”

The remainder of the team
had a disappointing showing
at the tourney. Several wrest-
lers had three or four matches
but still came away without

Sports this week _

and Jack Summe both missed
placing in the top four by one
match.

The biggest disappointment
of the day was the perfor-
mance of Mark Scandling. The
150 Ib. champ last year, he
was the first seed in this year’s
tourney. Scandling’s hopes of
a second championship were
destroyed in the second round
as he lost a 3-2 decision.
Coming back through the
consolations, he was once
again on the short end of a 3-2
score.

Friday night the wrestlers
have a chance to redeem their
mediocre performances in the
tournament when they take on
the Bears of Livingstone Col-
lege at 7 p.m. in Johnston

cold defense of the Thighs.
And, as the adage goes,
defense wills out.

IFT erected an ever stiff-
ening kind of stick-to-your-
cheeks, buns-to-the-goal-line
defense which filled all the
gaps, frusrating nearly all the
well-practiced plays thrown
against it.

Safety and seam man Mark
Firth, along with the lightning
rush of the Schmade, forced
many an interception as IFT
slid into an 18-13 victory.

In the losers bracket (and
how appropriate that term is)
the SPE’s and SAE’s went
into a mind boggling over-
time.

Luckily however, the SPE’s
had a rule book on the sideline
and out-gooded the SAE’s,
thus eliminating tose moo-
cows, sending them back

' down along the road to the

house, a keg and a Queen’s
mixer.

Rule books couldn’t help the
SPE’s in their ensuing re-
match with KA. For a while it
was a contest, as the south-
eners with tinsilled jerseys
were unaccustomed to loser’s
bracket competition.

The SPE’s, being wily vet-
erans of that status, only lost
40-something to 20-some-
thing. It was quiet at the
house that afternoon, the skull
and cross-bone sign dark with
despair. Shame is Pride’s
cloak.

Then there was the dream
match-up on field #2. The
finals.

"Bet they couldn’t adjust,
couldn’t alter their set pat-
terns and depended too heav-
ily on the accurate throwing
and scrambling abilities of
QB Dave Thomas.

The sidelines were packed,
the referees out in force, the
sun low on the pines and Tom
Stephenson had bought a pair
of hands. IFT romped.

It was 32-0 before KA
managed to score. The final
was 45-13, with IFT substitu-
ting freely all nine players.

_ The maroon horde was van-

quished.

And that’s all she wrote,
except for the fact that the
SPE’s beat off again.
