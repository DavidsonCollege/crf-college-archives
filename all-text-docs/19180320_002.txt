IMITATING HEAVEN.

There is a conundrum connected with
the shaven heads of those of our student
body. Why are their heads so much
like heaven? There is no dyeing or part

DAVIDSON HISTORIC.

The community in which we are set
has a number of places of interest for
those who are hero worshippers and for
those possessed with a mania for histori-
cal data and detail. Gen. D. H. Hill
is buried in the Davidson cemetery. The
grave of General Davidson, which is of
more than historic interest, is at Hope-

with Private Peat “come smiling out of

WHY THE CLASSICS?

Much labor and ink has been shame-
fully wasted in knocking the study of
classics in a college curriculum. “This
thing of casting them off is superficial
and tends to substitute other elements in
the place of culture—one of the greatest
things which can be obtained from a col-
lege course.

What makes a poem or a drama or
any form of literature a classic? Here
is the apt definition of Dr. Harding: It
lays in the expression of the primary
emotions and sentiments of the heart,
which were essentially the same as they

They were exprest in a vel-
vet smoothness. ‘Today is just the past
again entered thru another gate. Most
of the fine ideals held up now as some
new striking propaganda have _ their
counterpart and analogous situation in
classical literature.. This is illustrated
by a passage from Sophocles’ Oedipus
the King in which the Priest says:

Do not give us cause

So to remember this thy reign, as men,
Who having risen, then fall low again;
But raise our state to safety.”

What but this are Americans today
saving to the greatest Davidsonian ?

We do not use these columns for ad
vertising purposes but we would like to
urge men interested in culture and liter-
ature—the very. best that has been
thought and said—to take Greek litera-
ture in their. work next It is a
profitable study. On Greek mythology
and literature the foundation for Eng
lish literature is found. Why not study
this as a foundation for literature and as
an interpretation of human nature?
Sophomore English would) mean) much
more to a student if at the beginning of
the term two or three weeks would be
devoted to a rapid) study Gayley's
Classi Myths, other accredited
edition of mythology.

When planning your course for next
