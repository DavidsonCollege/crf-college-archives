CHARLOTTE GAME.

The Davidson team made it three
straight in their series with the Char-
lotte Y. M. C. A. when they defeated
that team at Charlotte Friday night by a
score of 49 to 34. The game was much
faster and more exciting than the other
two. Davidson was handicapped by
having Childs and Wood out of this
game, but Murray, who played left for-
ward, proved himself a good running
mate for King, caging six baskets and
playing all-round fast ball. George
King led the scoring with 18 points to
his credit. Marsh was the particular
star for Charlotte.

The C. H. S.-Horner teams played
an exciting game before the big game
and between halves, the final score being
20-12,

The line-up was as follows:

CHARLOTTE. POSITION. DAVIDSON.
Marsh (12) .. .. .. .. .. King (18)
Forwards.

STETSON GAME,

The Davidson five registered another
victory Wednesday night when thev
‘met the team renresenting Stetson Un'-
versity, of Florida, on the local floor
the final score being 47 to 14.

The game. was fast and hard forcht
thrvout. notwithstanding the one-sided
score. Fast field work and long and
difficult shots, made usually by the local
team, furnished many thrills to the snec-
tators, who were loud and impartial in
their applause. This game was espe-
cially interesting to the students as it
gave them their last opportunity of sec-
ing their team in action. before leaving
on their long trip thru the State.

For Davidson. King was in his best
farm. making 18 of his team’s 47 points.
Captain Hengeveld, Reese and Murrav.
the latter plaving his first game on the
home floor. each succeeded in adding
materially to the score, pulling off manv
difficult shots. Walker played his usual
steadv. game at guard. Childs and
Wood were both out of the game with
inivries. Childs, however, accompan-
ied the team Monday and will probably
he able to plav at least a part of every
game. Wood will be able to join the
team Fridav and take part in the closing
games of the trin.

For Stetson. Rutherford at center was
the especial star, with Captain Bailey
and Finle sharing honors.

The line-up was as follows:

Goal in Saturdays Contest

The inter-class football season opene:!
Saturday, when the Junior and Sopho
more teams battled to a_ scoreless tie.
The game was hard fought thruout, anid
proved interesting in many pafts, altho
lack of practice handicapped both teams.
Both teams threatened to score at sev-
eral stages. but neither developed enough
punch to make the threat good.

The Sophs showed up to better ad-
vantage in advancing the ball and gain-
ed more ground, but the Junior line held
at critical points. During much of the
time the ball. see-sawed from = 25-vard
line to 25-vard line, and exchanges of
punts were frequent. Both teams show-
ed unusually good class hall material.
and should, with a week’s more practice
put up a much higher class exhibition in
the coming games.

The Juniors furnished no particular
luminaries. but showed better —team-
work. “Bob” Jones was the chief «f-
fensive factor, run his team well. while
Captain Richardson and Clark were
especially effective an the defense.

For the Sophs “Floss” White was in
a class bv himself. He did about two-
thirds of the defensive work of his team
oad _praved a good ground gainer ales
Captain Tohnson was the particular of-
fensive star, pulling off many long runs.
“Pat” Robson at quarter ran his team

‘ell, in spite of the freely given and].

‘anfident advice urged unon him bv hk
“enerous team-mates. “McAskill showed
up especially well at end.

The line-up was as follows:

JUNIORS. POSITION. SOP HS.
Richardson.......LB 0.2... Boswell
Finley. ... 00.0... LT ....... Poole
Davis........... LG .. C. W. Worth

MOTION PICTURE LECTURF,
SECURED BY COLLEGE.

The next in the series of college lec:
stures and entertainments will be given
in Shearer Hall Friday, February 2nd.
at 6:48. This will consist of two films
of motion pictures: “From Cloth to
Suit.” and “Trails in the Canadian
Rockies.” These films, are shown thru
the courtesy of the Bureau of Commer-
cial Economics, of Washington.

These pictures will be shown here but
once, and no doubt will be verv interest-
ing and instructive. No admission will
be charged, and the public is cordially
invited. The time for presenting is
from one-half to three-fourths of an
hour. thus making it possible for every
man in the student body to see the pic-
tures with the expenditure of a minimum
of time.

During the rest of the season there
will be several other interesting produc-
tions sent here by this bureau.

At a meeting of the Polity Club last
night, T.. A. Chambliss gave an able re-
view of “Social Progress and the Dar-
winian Theory,” by Nasmythe. This
book shows the fallacy of the argument
set forth by certain propagandists that
war is an institution for the existence of
society. The review was clear in stvle.
sn that all of the author’s main conten-
tions were clearly grasped.

Monday on Muddy Field

Home the Bacon

Last Monday afternoon in the second
game of the class football series the Sen-
iors defeated the Fresh by the score of
6 too. It was close and hotly contested
during all stages, and it seemed ag if
neither side would win until the last.

The game was played on a muddy
field, which kept both sides from doing
their best. It was in the last thirty sec-
onds of the game when the Seniors. re-
covered a fumble and W. P. Keesler
threw a forward pass te Mattison, who
ran thirty vards for a touchdown,

For the Seniors, Mattison, Miller and
McMillan were the outstanding stars,
while Sizer and Levburn did) exceed-
ingly well for the Fresh.
