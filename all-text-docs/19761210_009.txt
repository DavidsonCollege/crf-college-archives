IP’s reflect on folly, fulfillment

By ANN GARNER
Staff Writer

As one listens to the now more
prevalent and frequent knocks on
doors up-and-down halls, gasps as
one looks into the bathroom’ mirror
finding it trimmed in brightly colored
paper, and is amazed at the barrage of
smiling faces on rainy Tuesday
nights, it’s almost impossible not to
wonder what’s going on.

No, not quite the Christmas spirit,
it’s election fever and although our
attention is focused towards the
candidates, the charges made and felt
by the present officers must not be
ignored as they now leave offices.

Baskin

Upon taking office, Bo Baskin,
SGA President, found that he became
more directed towards student rela-
tions than those specifically on the
Senate level. Becoming necessary to
broaden his outlook to the fundamen-
tal interest of Davidson College, he
discovered this was sometimes his
only solstice when ‘‘caught between a
rock and a hard place’”’ in dealing with
students, faculty, and administra-
tion.

Baskin had no specific crusades in
mind in running yet tackled such
projects as course evaluation and a
reevaluation of student life in taking
over as SGA president. Though not
as fulfilling in the sense of still
unfinished projects, Baskin feels that
the frustration involved, in those
times when having to subordinate
academics and hall counseling, and
when accused of being a ‘‘sellout’’ by
students themselves, has helped him
to grasp the full scope of Davidson
College from all aspects involving the
administration, as a student, and in
faculty relations.

Baskin explained that although the
term was frequently a ‘‘catch-all’’,
having held office has helped him
“‘grow-up” by being held responsible
for the maintenance of communica-
tion, in delegating authority, and in
facing the frequent obstacles that the
office of SGA president has entailed.

Matthew Covington

Matthew Covington, editor of The
Davidsonian, found that The David-
sonian provided him with an opport-
unity to investigate the things that
interest him in being able to ‘‘deal
within the system’’ that was pre-
viously dealt to him.

Covington feels that The Davidson-
ian is fulfilling by the very fact of
creating something each week. ‘‘You
look at it as a creation but also a
production, which tends to bring you
down to earth.”

In imagining himself as running a
‘small organization”, Covington dis-
covered that it was often necessary to
“act the part’”’. ‘“You have to refuse to
accept your own inadequacies,’’ Cov-
ington explained, ‘‘“You need to be a
responsible authority figure.’’

Covington expressed the desire to
throw editorial decisions out to be
made by the staff. “It doesn’t really
work, though, it leads to mayhem, or
mayher, in the days of Title IX.”

“If I had to do it all over again,”’
Covington pondered, “I would ask for
a suit of armor for Christmas.’’ As
much help as Iget before publication,
I get for more help afterwards. It’s
often times painful and sharp and
with a suit, I’d be better able to fend

, 99

off such ‘help’.

Karl Goodhouse

Karl Goodhouse, President of the
Union Board, discovered his work on
individual programs to be more time
consuming, out of choice, than expec-
ted. Dealing with the general coor-
dination of the Union program in both
social and co-curricular activities, his
office’s main goal is to make the
Union a more vital force in campus
life.

Upon taking office Karl planned to
accomplish this objective by creating
a basic Union structure that would
allow people the freedom to influence
Union activities, increase emphasis
on co-curricular events and to revamp
the Artists Series to reflect the
interests of faculty, staff, and stu-
dents.

Goodhouse sees this past year as
personally satisfying in terms of the
changes he has experienced by merely
working with a greater number and
variety of people. He has adopted
several philosophies. ‘‘You can’t be a
perfectionist ,’’ he says, ‘‘you have to
set your sights realistically or low and
expect to accomplish half of it.”

Goodhouse reflected this self-pre-
servationism when asked what advice
he would give to his successor.
Goodhouse responded, ‘‘Abdicate.”’

Steve Peeples

As co-curricular chairman of the
Union Board, Steve Peeples was
surprised to find that his job entailed
more than just finding the best
entertainment for the best price. He
found that it was necessary to be
sensitive to people’s views in terms of
the size, atmosphere and attitudes of
Davidson as well as fulfilling the
purpose of his office in the real
extension of academics into ‘‘real
life’.

Peeples set out to create a balance
of artistic media while fulfilling the
wants of the entire Davidson com-
munity ina ‘‘systematic, sensible,
and well-planned’ manner. Peeples
sees his role as more successful than
evidenced to the ‘‘outsider’”’ having
seen and dealt with problems only
experienced by the ‘‘insider’’, and has
found his office ‘‘extremely rewarding
in terms of anonymous gratification
when something is well presented and
received.”

Becoming more tolerant of people
in administration and their problems,
Peeples has discovered that ‘‘a learn-
ing experience outside of the class-
room is not just a cliche.”

John McArthur

Becoming president of the YMCA,
unopposed, John McArthur took
office with the sole conviction that the
Y should be a ‘‘vital part of David-
son”’ finding ‘‘something missing
without it in terms of student life.”’

9

The goals of the Davidson Y were
defined soon after his election during
a retreat and were concerned with
involvement in community programs,
social-spiritual aspects of Davidson
on campus, and educational activi-
ties. McArthur holds the conviction
that ‘there is really no such thing as
student apathy but rather it is the
non-enthusiasm of the leaders that
makes it hard for students to become
involved.”

McArthur sees his job as president
fulfilling in the sense of having to
initiate many programs and finds that

it fosters maturity—and anxiety in
the sense “‘if anything’s gonna go,
you're the one.’’ Yet he attributes the
bulk of the Y’s success to its
“informal and playful atmosphere.’’

Because of this McArthur states,
‘You do it because you like it, not
because you’re going to get recog-
nized. This makes it easier to work in
—or play in—whatever.”

Jack Golden

Having occupied his position as
station manager for WDAV for
almost two years, Jack Golden was
faced with many problems when first
taking office. Aside from repairing
the splintered WDAV staff, Golden’s
main goals were to go stereo and to
concentrate on adding continuity to
programming.

He feels that he has been partially
successful in this attempt calling the
7 am to 3 pm program a hodge podge
while having organized the evening
hours.

Although finding the office ex-
tremely rewarding personally in work-
ing with a great many people and
projects and realizing his capacity for
work, Golden expressed some disap-
pointment in having only partially
elevated the status of WDAV from its
regarded position as, ‘‘second-med-
ia’.
He attributes this to the fact that it
was relegated to “second rank’’ with
lack of time being regarded as the
major reason. Golden is not leaving
the office, however, without fond
memories.
