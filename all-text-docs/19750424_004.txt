Guides freely

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Staff Writer

Each week of the school year
prospective students come to
Davidson to be interviewed by
the admissions staff and to look
around the campus. Davidson
students serve as tour guides
for these prospective students
and their parents. To an extent,
the applicants’ first impression
of Davidson is seen through
these host’s and hostesses’
eyes.

What do the guides stress as
they show guests around cam-
pus? How do they answer poten-
tially sensitive questions that
the students or their parents
may ask? How do the guides fit
into the scheme of admissions
at Davidson?

Three Davidson students who
work as guides and/or hosts and
hostesses related their answers
to these questions. The follow-
ing interviews with Junior Bob
Hoag, Sophomore’ Dana
English, and Freshman Sam
Weir indicate the wide variety
of perspectives a prospective
student and his parents may
gain from a day at Davidson.

Bob Hoag:

Hoag works as a volunteer for
the admissions office and has
about one guide assignment per
week. The tour begins usually
after the student has been. in-
terviewed by someone from the
admissions staff and lasts bet-
ween 35 and 40 minutes.

“I try to give an informat
view of the whole thing): Ifa
student has a special interest; F
concentrate longer on this,” he
said. For instance, if a student
is interested in Davidson’s pre-
med program, Hoag spends
some extra time showing him
the laboratory facilities and
other things that might interest
him particularly.

The parents usually are the
most inquisitive. ‘‘Parents ask
most of the questions: most of
my stuff is directed toward the
parents. Studénts ask questions
like how much they’ll have to
study,’’ Hoag commented.

Although the parents and
students ask a variety of
questions, many of them deal
with the social situation on cam-
pus. Status of fraternities,
weekend activities, and the
proximity of shopping centers
are common questions.

Controversial question

Sometimes, however, a con-
troversial question arises. Hoag
commented, ‘Parents may see
an issue in The Davidsonian
such as tenure and ask about it.
Most of the time Ill state the
issue, but I don’t dwell too long
on my opinion. About 90 percent
of the time they ask my opinion
about the issue.”’ :

Other subjects that come up

the tours concern the
chemistry facilities, religious

life at Davidson, and the use of
drugs by students.
Hoag admits that the

chemistry building is not the
“most desirable in the world.
However, he feels a the a
ber of pre-med applicants ac-
- cepted in graduate schools show
that Davidson’s facilities must
be of good quality.
Also, he tells students that the
chemistry facilities are a top-

priority concern of the ad.
ministration. Hoag cautions ©
that chemistry students are

overcrowded, but he thinks that

the staggered lab periods and

the availability of professors

helps ease the overcrowding

somewhat.

Church ties

~«‘Because Davidson was foun:

ded.and is supported in part by
the’ Presbyterian church, a
common question concerns the

‘stauts of church ties to the
‘school. Hoag tells them, “The

feligious aspect is here if you

iwant it, but it’s certainly not

forced.”
** Parents often ask about drugs

on campus. Hoag reminds

them that drugs are a part of
the world and that Davidson has

its share. “It’s here, but you
have to look for it to find it,’’ he
remarked. Hoag tells guests
that most drugs are confined to
pot, although he has seen some
students popping pills. He tells

percent of the student body par-
takes.

Southern students

According to Hoag, most of
the prospective students he sees
come from the Southern and
Mid-Atlantic states. “I can’t
remember anyone from north
of Maryland,” he said.

Dana English:

“T like it a lot if the student
will talk to me more than the
parents will,’” commented
English. She worked for the ad-
missions office as a volunteer
during fall and winter terms
this year, “I try to address most
of my answers to the student
even if the parents ask the
questions,”’ she added.

English tries to give a
background to her guests. ‘I
love the history of the college,”’
she said. English usually begins
her tour at the quadrangle of
the old campus and makes a
special effort to point out the’
literary buildings.

Frank ahout inadequacies

“I’m pretty frank about what
I don’t like or what. is not
adequate,” English remarked.
Some subjects she makes a
point to mention to parents and
prospective students concern
the status of co-education,
Union facilities, housing, and
academics. “There aren’t too

English tells students that,
.although Davidson has madethe
transition to coeducation
smoothly, the physical
education facilities for women
are not adequate. Her tour does
not include the Union. “‘It’s not
representative of where the
students go on’ campus,’’ she
commented.

English explains why she
thinks the Union is not adequate
for students’ needs and tells the
prospective students about im-
provements being made in the
new Union.

Inner world

In order to let students and
parents see the inner world of
Davidson as well as academic
facilities, English takes the
guests into the dorm and shows
them a couple of rooms, in-
cluding her own. Also, she tries
to let them meet a professor or
two.

When students ask about
social life on campus, English
describes a typical weekend
and lets the guests talk with
some men as well as women
students. She explains, ‘‘The
campus is pretty fraternity
oriented and pretty informal.
There are lots of activities for
freshmen, but you have to work
at getting to know up-
perclassmen.”’

Academic pressure

Concerning academic
pressure, English tells the
students, “There is a lot of

and Brenda Parnell discuss the application of a

pressure. I say that most people
around here don’t take the
whole weekend off, especially in
the fall or winter terms.”’

“T get many questions about
religious life on campus. I tell
them I think the church has a lot
of service type activities for
people to get in.” At this time,
English sees the church as
more of a driving social force
than the YMCA, but she admits
that this is changing.

issues

She is displeased with the ad-
ministration’s handling of the
housing situation on campus.
English said that she points out
to students and their parents
that the College has not made
any efforts to stabilize the
enrollment even though op-
portunities for increased
housing have not. been

“Professors are really ac-
cessible. I feel like there’s a lot
of interpersonal relationships
between students and faculty
members,’’ English remarked.
sam Weir: }

Weir takes students and their
parents to lunch for the ad-
missions office. Sometimes
they have had tours around
campus, but other times he just
gives them a quick tour before
lunch. ‘I try to show students
that Davidson is made up of
real people and is not just a
catalogue. I emphasize the
friendliness on campus,” Weir
commented.

He stresses the, honor code
and its relation to unlocked
rooms, coed dorms, tests, and
self-scheduled exams. Also,
Weir makes a point to mention
the size of the College and how
this affects social relationships.

Prospective students never
mentioned their admissions in-
terviews or applications to
Hoag, English, or Weir. All
three guides praised the ad-
missions office. They said that
the staff told them at the begin-
ning of the year not to be over
critical or over enthusiastic
either-- rather, they should be
honest with the students and
their parents.

YM/YWCA founds

coordinating forum

By BRAD SWALWELL
Staff Writer

YM/YWCA President Susan
Cunningham has __ begun
erganizing the Inter-
Organizational Forum to deal
with the problems caused by the
myriad student organizations
on campus.

The organization will consist
of two representatives each
from the Black’ Student
Coalition, The Davidsonian: the
Patterson Court Council, the
SGA Senate, the College Union,
and the YM/YWCA.

Cunningham feels that. this
will benefit Davidson students
by solving problems which
arise when responsibility for
organizing and funding student

Donations requested
for Schoolhouse Fair

The Children’s Schoolhouse
Attic Sale and Fair will be held
between 9 a.m. and ?
p.m. on Saturday. May 3. on
the Davidson Village Green.
Students wishing to rid them-
selves of any usable clothing,
books. records. plants. or
household goods are invited to
donate them to the rummage
sale.

Donations should be made at
Dr. Ligo’s office in the Cun-
ningham Fine Arts Center. If
pickup service from dorm or
apartment is necessary. call
Nancy Hazel at 892-1379.

Proceeds from the sale and
fair will go to the Children’s
Schoolhouse, a _ multi-age,
parent cooperative preschool in
Cornelius.

The fair will also include a
baked goods sale. a raffle.
prizes for which include
Carowinds tickets. a dinner for
two at Gus’ Forty-Niner. and

gift certificates from local
shops--a children’s fun fair, and
refreshments. UNC-C com-
mercial art students will be of-
fering some of their work for
sale.

projects and activities becomes
blurred due to the large number
of student organizations.

“The Forum. would be an
organization of organizations,”
said Cunningham.

“Tt will be a discussion group
where the leaders of student
ib cal gee at Davidson get
together to assess each ’s
problems. The Forum will help
groups work together to solve
problems and accomplish
goals.’’

The Forum will meet weeklv

to co-ordinate the various
projects which different groups
have going on campus, and
Possibly take over some of the
funding of the projects.

Cunningham cited three
examples of situations in which
such an organization of
organizations would be helpful.

When Ron Scott was making
his decisions about the changes
on food services for the rest of
the year (price increases,
closing Rusk House, etc.), he
could have come to the Forum
to get student views and ideas
on his proposed changes.

Any administrator who wan- -
ted a range of student ideas on a
problem could come to the
Forum for information, instead
of going first to the YM/YWCA,
then to the SGA, and then to the
Union,

Finally, since the Forum has
representatives from Patterson
Court Council, the group.could
eliminate scheduling conflicts
which arise when the Union and
fraternities plan activities for
the same night.
