GOOD TIMING, GIRLS, PARTIES —

AND A FOOTBALL GAME

IT’S HOMECOMING AGAIN, and the Davidson |
Gentleman is at his best. He has shaved for the first time |
since Rush Week; he has finally picked up that suit he
had dry cleaned two weeks ago; he has tipped over to
Hood's or Johnson’s for a trim around the ears; he may |
have stopped in at Rush’s and bought a new sweater or |
some new dancing slippers; and he has put his books on |
the shelf and Shakespeare, mitosis, political theory, |
and the Slobbovian War of 16?? in the back of his mind. |

In short, he is sitting on ready. Cop Linker or no)
Cop Linker, he is ready to turn it on.

Amidst all the good timing, parties, and that good-
looking chick hanging on your arm, though, we'd like to |
take this time to remind you that the original purpose of
Homecoming takes place tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. down on
the football field.

While most of us are out frolicing tonight, about 45.
Davidson students will be going to bed early with one
thing on their minds—beating Presbyterian College.

The least we can do is go to Richardson Stadium to-
morrow afternoon and support them.

HOMECOMING (UGH!)

THE WORD “Homecoming” isn’t exactly a pretty
word around here as far as football fans are concerned.

In the past twenty Homecoming games, Davidson has
won two and tied one—not an impressive record. For
awhile, it was thought that there was a jinx connected
with the Homecoming weekend, especially when Wildcat
elevens lost 14 straight Homecoming battles from 1940-
1953.

But in 1954 and 1955, a powerful Davidson team
eliminated the jinx theory with astounding 51-6 and 54-0)
wins over West Virginia Tech and Washington & Lee,
respectively. The following year, we tied VMI, 13-13.
Apparently, that unlucky number put another mojo on)
us. The following year, a flu epidemic postponed the}.
game, and for the past three years we haven't scratched.

Presbyterian has been Davidson’s Homecoming foe
several times. During the 14-year famine, the Blue Hose
inflicted two losses on the Wildcats—14-12 in 1951, and
19-18 in 1953.

THE RIVALRY

THE DAVIDSON-PRESBYTERIAN series began in,
1919, and when the dust had settled from the first en-,
counter, a 0-0 score on the scoreboard foretold of the
ensuing rivalry.

Yue first eight games were dominated by Davidson,
who compiled a 6-1-1 record against their brethrcn to the
south. During this initial span (1919-1926), PC managed
only two TD's and a field goal against the rugged ’Cats.

Evident!y, the local athletic department felt too rug-
ged tor PC, because in 1927 they dropped PC from the
schedule. For the next twenty years Davidson enjoyed
the status of being in the elite “Dig Five” club of North
Carolina. The ’Cats played such teams as Arniy, Georgia |
Tech, Harvard, and the other four meimbers of the “Big |
Five’’—Carolina, Duke, State, and Wake Forest.

But the other schools started buying ball players and |

|
|
j

Davidson had to seek for lesser opponents. So, in 1949, | —

PC was rescheduled, and the Blue Hose promptly re-|
sponded with a 27-7 win over their prodigal brothers.
The rivalry has continued, and the current standings |
find Davidson still ahead with a 10-8-1 record. However,
PC has delighted in beating the sophisticated Southern
Conference members five times in the past eight years.

THE CRYSTAL BALL

Our crystal ball was shattered last weekend (1 right,
3 wrong), and we now have a mediocre 14-8 record. But
we mended the pieces together and took another look.

Davidson should break a two game losing streak, de-
spite it being Homecoming, and hand PC its fourth set-
back, 21-7.

William & Mary can’t perform another miracle like
they did against Furman last week, and should fall to an
improving Citadel, 144. Other games: Furman over
Howard, 22-7; Richmond over George Washington, 21-13;
Virginia over VMI, 22-20; Tulane over VPI, 21-0; and
Pittsburgh over West Virginia, 21-14.

Traditional

Rival PC

Likes To Throw Ball

BY STEVE CLARK
Davidsonian Sports Editor

The thirty-eighth annual Davidson College Home-
coming football game gets underway tomorrow afternoon
at 2:30, in Richardson Stadium.

On hand for the occasion are
the Presbyterian College Blue
Hose, traditional rival of the
local Wildcats. Tomorrow's con-
test will be the twentieth meet-
ing of the two Southern Pres-
byterian schools on the gridiron.

Davidson Coach Bill Dole has
not fared very well against his
brethren from Clinton, S. C. His
overall record against PC is 3-6,
and many of those losses came
during five straight winning
seasons for Dole (1954-1958).

BAD PUNT

Last season the Wildcats fell
to PC by a score of 6-0 at Clin
ton. Davidson's offense could
never get moving, and a bad
punt set up the lone PC tally

Presbytergan brings a. not
impressive record of 0-3 into
tomorrow's game. Their three
have been to Furman,
27-6; Lenoir Rhyne, 28-8; and
Wofford, 14-8. However, the
record may be deceiving since
the Blue Hose are a noted small
college powerhouse every year.

“PC will throw a lot,”
Dole, “but their speed is not

losses

says

sophomore quarterback Earl
Cole to do the job. Cole, who
took over the number one job
when Benny Coxton was injured
in the Furman game, has re-
sponded beautifully by taking
over the lead in total offense in
ihe Southern Conference.

Cole's chief targets are ends
Jerry Sheffield, Booker Clark,
and Lou Zirkle, and halfbacks
Alex Gibbs and Joe Jones. Top
ground gainers for the ‘Cats are
Gibbs and Jim Fuller.

Davidson's big question mark
still remains pass defense. Dole
hopes that he has solved the
problem, anl he should find. out
tomorrow against the air-minded
Hose.

FROSH PLAY

freshman team journeyed down
to Charleston, S. C., for a game
with The Citadel frosh

chances, despite a 38-7 loss to
