THE DAVIDSONIAN

B ACK PAGE INTERVIEW MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1994

D onna Peters

brought to Davidson

some of her comic talent,
and something of herself.

September 22, 1994

What were your ambitions
when you first came to
Davidson?

Chemistry major.

Are you serious?

Yes, very serious. I thought,
okay, I really liked that in high
school. I’m going to be achem-
istry major and then I’m going
to go to med school. Well, one
chemistry class—out the win-
dow. And then law school—
until I graduated, and I worked
fora bank. Tknow some people
who work for banks, and they
like it. Ididn’t. But hada good
time there.

What led you to theater after
graduating from Davidson
with an English degree?
Well, I really...I dabbled in it in
high school. I kind of just got
turned turned to it during my
senior year. So I knew when I
graduated that was what I
wanted to do. I just hadn’t
figured out how I was going to
do it, or how I was going to tell
my parents—you know, things
like that. I decided that, be-
cause everything I have ever
done in my life has been very
practical, I should go get train-
ing, which was definitely the
right thing for me. Not every-
body feels the same way, but I
do. It's like if someone plays
the oboe, they play the oboe and
get better. An actor uses their
body, and with training is bet-
ter—I completely believe in
that. Can I give you my anec-
dote about acting while we’re
onthe subject? Anybody in the
world can call themselves an
actor, and it makes me so mad
because, if you work in a res-
taurant, you wouldn’t say, "Oh,
I’ma brain surgeon, but I’m not
practicing right now.” Any-
body can say they're an actor,
soit’s very importantto be proud
_of what you’re doing and know
a lot more than all those other
busboys who call themselves
anactor. Forme, going to gradu-
ate school and saying, “Yes, I
also have an MFA,” is a little
more self-assuring.

What has been your greatest
moment so far in this career?
There are three. Can I have
three moments?

. Sure.
Okay. My first moment would
be...we did a musical at

Davidson—there hadn’t been a
musical at Davidson for ten
years or so—Leonard
Bernstein’s Wonderful Town,
and I was the main woman and
singer. I don’t call myself a
singer, but you don’t cringe or
anything when Ising. Butthat’s
the first time I realized maybe I
should do comedy. I thought,
“T like this. This feels right.”
That was the first catapult: The
second one would be when I
gave my one-woman show. I
originally had to do it as an
MFA assignment and, again,
started thinking maybe I should
take this writing thing a little
more seriously. The third time,
for strictly monetary reasons, I
got a small part, speaking, in a
George Lucas movie, that will
be released in October, and that
was a really big moment be-
cause whenever you tell some-
one you’re an actor they say,
“Have you done any movies?”
And then they say, “Did you
have a speaking part?” And I
can say yes to both those ques-
tions. So] feel like that was, in
terms of acting as a career, not
artistically, but as a career, I
feel like that was a big plus.

What do you find is the most
difficult aspect of doing com-
edy?

It completely changes depend-
ing on the age group of the
people. I thought it would
change because of the region,

like whether they lived in the

South, because my show is all I

know, really, about comedy.:

My show is, uh, very Southern.

I thought that the South would

make a difference—I did it in
New York, I did it in Atlanta,
and it didn’t make a difference.
It was received the same way.
But what really makes a differ-
‘ence is the age of the people. I
can kind of change the show,
because I wrote it and I’m not
going to sue myself, you know,
for violating the copyright or
‘something. But, I change it if I
kind of have an idea of the age
of the audience. Like if the
audience is really young, cer-
tain things aren’t going to fly,
because they’re kind of embar-
rassed to laugh at each other.

What about acting in general?
I guess just staying warmed up
in between jobs, because they

I should have asked for her autograph.

The minute hand on my watch
showed I was five minutes late,

. }.and as I ran across the lawn to the

Union, I hoped to see Donna Pe-
ters just walking into the Cafe,
instead of sitting alone at a table
fuming about rude journalists.
Luckily, Donna was running
late as well, probably grabbing a
bite to eat between her rehearsal
and her “big interview.” We stood
in opposite corners of the room for
awhile, before she approached and

said, “Bobby? You look like you’ re

looking for someone.”

I had been looking for some-
one, in fact. The woman whose
face I had seen on fliers around

campus, the woman I had read so ~

much about in the past week, the
charming comedienne whose show
I was going to see that night—in
name, the Donna Peters.

This Donna Peters was a little
shorter than Iexpected, was dressed
casually, carried a large bag just
like any student around here, and
seemed right at home.

Actually, she was right at
home. Donna graduated from

Davidson in 1989, and went onto .

earn an MFA in acting from UNC
Chapel Hill. She was here to do
her one-woman show, free for
Davidson students and faculty, a
gift to a school she holds dear.

The performance, entitled The
Hoffman Hotel (That’s hotel, not
hotel), is based on experiences she
had at a Chatham, Alabama gath-
ering place when she was a child,
and she claims that none of the
names have been changed. H.B.
(or Honly Bonly for those who saw
the show) is her uncle, for ex-
ample.

Her comedy show has taken
her from Atlanta to New York, not
to mention all over North Caro-

thought, "I like this. This feels right."

really don’t come that often.
But once you do it for a while,
and once you move in to anew
city, you’re trying to establish
yourself as an actor, and it takes
awhile. Let’s say in January I
have an audition, and I don’t
have another one until March—
it’s really hard not to make that
March audition a life or death
situation. And it isn’t life or
death—it’s a stupid audition.
Not life; not death. Just go and
have a good time. It’s really
hard to keep that in perspective.
Andalsoit’s hard because I feel

like I’m pumping all this time.

into it, and I’m very practical.
I’m not into the starving artist

scene. I don’t have five nose.

rings, and if you did you
couldn’t get a job! You see all
these people walking around
with nose rings and tatoos on
their necks and everything, and
they can’t even get a job, and if
they get ajob they won’t havea
career. There’s a big differ-
ence. Not unless you’re enor-
mously famous or fabulously
beautiful. I mean, if you know
you can get places strictly by
the way you look, and I don’t

lina. Her talent has landed her
roles on stage, and recently on
film—in George Lucas’s soon-to-
be-released Radioland Murders.

Knowing all this, and having
talked with Donna foran hourabout
our Alabama childhoods, I went to
her show filled with laughter that
needed an excuse to come out.

And she provided one. Her
presentation was so endearing and
personal that I could not help feel-
ing part of Chatham’s strange, re-
markable community.

After the show, Donna stuck

around to talk with her fans, old
and new, and to reminisce with
some of her old professors. No one
wanted her to leave, but it is better
that she has. This school gave her
some of what she needed to suc-
ceed, and it is time for her to use
it—to continue to use it.

Have things changed since
1989? Not much, really. There is
a big building on the corner of
Main and Griffith that was not
there before. Will Terry has re-
tired. Norton’s barber shop has
closed. And Donna Peters is a star.

Well, maybe not yet. But she
is certainly on her way.

mean that in a bad way—if I
could do it, I would do it, I
would take complete advantage
of it—but that’s hard. But it’s
not bad; if it was bad I wouldn’t
do it. It’s not a negative thing,
but it keeps you on your toes.

Do you enjoy stagework or
filmwork more?

I have to say stage, because
that’s where I’ve had my big-
gest parts. If I had a lead ina
movie, I’d say film, because
you get so much more expo-
sure, and everybody in the world
can see you, and the money is
phenomenal. ‘But right now I’d
have to say stage.

What wasit like working with
George Lucas?

He was very...very quiet. He
just did his business, he got
business done. And he was
very friendly to everybody, and
very accessible.. I have a lot of
respect for him aside from his
career. He’s a big family man,

and he makes pretty clean mov-
ies, movies a lotof family people
can appreciate. He had his chil-
dren there with him—I mean,

hey, if I could pay for a nanny,

I would, too—but, he had his
family theré. He wants to edu-
cate people in the arts—it could
be music, theater, painting,
whatever. It’s just the biggest
relief to find stable people.
Would he know me if I passed
him on the street? Idon’t know,
I'd have to remind him, prob-
ably.

What are your plans for the
future?

I’m trying to decide if I want to
turn my one-woman show into
a play. Like a full length play
with characters, not just for me.
I’mtrying to write a screenplay
now. I’m reading books on
how todo it—/ don’tknow how
to do it. And I’m also ready to
Start something new, write
something new. I’ve been do-
ing this show for about, I guess,
two years in December, andI’m
going to try something new—
see if I can make it work.
