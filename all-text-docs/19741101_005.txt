Fireside Warmth Cools Hot Tempers

I was working my way
through a charming little
column on how my fireplace
and I discussed my Future one*
late Saturday night when my
attention was diverted by
details of a friend being houn-
ded into a ‘corner by
thoughtless yappings. The
details concerned the way he
chopped a hole in the wall and
dropped out of sight.

Surely no one will shed a
Kubla Khan tear over the loss
of the rest of my column. And I
still intend to talk about the
fire. in my fireplace. But I
can’t get my mind off this
friend and the hounds that

chase him, so a new angle is
demanded.

I also don’t want to slink into
the middle of petty con-
troversies. Because they’re
petty, and that’s: my worry.

The past few weeks in David- .

son have seen a lot of heated
words and boiling charges.
Personalities have been
dragged in through the mud.
It’s all a bit repulsive when
one works past the boredom.

A kind of perverse glee
seems to have cropped up at
the prospects of a few good
slugfests. After all, what are
Administrations and Trustees
for if not to hiss at? And what

are harmless student whims
for if not to be crushed?

I, for one, am put off by any

; controversy that smacks of

bitterness and resentment.
Sensationalism, misconcepti-
ons, mistrust, and slurs have
characterized the crusades of
Davidson this fall. And for
what? For the sake of a little
action, a good old radical: -
days-are-here-again fight.

It seems that the prevalent
charge of student apathy in
the 70’s has crept under
everyone’s skin and we’re
damned determined to show
the world that we can still kick
our feet and wave our arms as

Editor Fails To Sell Pictures

The trouble all began when
a friend of mine, walking
down the street, was accosted
by a seedy-looking character
in a rumpled trenchcoat.

“Hey, mister, take your pic-
ture for a dime?” My friend
agreed and posed for the snap-
shot. ‘‘Your picture will come
out next year in our pic-
turebook; we’ll send you a
copy then but you pay the
dime now,” said the decrepit
photographer. “By the way,
you wanna buy some dirty pic-
tures?’’ My friend. shook his
head, paid his dime, and
promptly forgot the incident.

He remembered it a year
later. A notice in the mail in-
formed him that he would soon
receive his copy of the annual
picturebook of the Society for
the Advancement of the Erotic
Arts.

The next morning, to his
surprise, he learned that the
government had raided the of-
fice of the Society and seized
all copies of the picturebook.
My friend, irritated over this
turn of events, called the
government offices. -

“Well, the Chairman has
declared that the volume con-
tains dangerous, obscene, and
inflammatory material.
Besides, his picture didn’t
turn out well. Anyway, the

overnment has scheduled a
co bonfire tonight and all
the confiscated copies will be
burned. The public is invited,
and we’re going to have mar-
shmellow roast after the books
are burned. It’ll be one of the
biggest social events of the
year.”

‘“‘What’s next on the agenda,

friend inquired dryly

“Say, that’s not a bad idea.
Let me speak to the Chairman
about that.”

“Look, I just want my pic-
turebook. What about the first
amendment?”

“That’s inoperable in ‘this
situation,” he snapped. My
friend hung .up disgustedly
and then decided to visit the
Society. Its office was a dingy

he entered.

“Wanna buy some dirty pic-
tures, mac?”’

“No, I just want to know
when I can get my pic-
turebook.”’

The editor replied with
several unprintable words.
“The government has blocked
the progress of truth, beauty,
and art,” he added. “But we
won’t take this passively.
We'll go underground and

print whatever words and
pictures we want, maybe even
some foldouts.’’

“Aren’t the controversial
expressions rather worn-out
and trite, anyway?”

“Oh, triteness is definitely
in this year,’’ the editor
assured him. ‘““Many
prestigious books have used
such trite expressions.
Besides, it’s so much easier
than originality.”

“All I want is my pic-
turebook,’’ muttered my
friend as he left. Before he got
out of the building, however,
another member of the pic-
eee staff hurried up to

‘Wanna buy some--”’

“No, I don’t want any pic-
tures, he snarled, losing con-
trol rapidly. “All I want is my

“If you don’t want no pic-
tures, maybe you like to buy
my sister. I sell her to you real
cheap.”’ My friend hit him.

frantically as ever. And of-
ficials seem to be intent to
show that they can still thrash
a mean switch on our legs.
This is a criticism of
methods, not issues. If anyone
cares to know; yes, I think the
college should be more con-
cerned with the housing it
provides; yes, I think the laun-
dry is an_ unpleasant
obligation placed on students;
yes, I think we should have the
right to publish an annual that
is a free expression ‘of a
student’s view of life at David-
son. For what it’s worth, I also
refuse to read the “‘Update”’
because I think much of it is

obscene in a larger sense of —

the word.

These issues need to be
discussed. Discussed, not
slugged about. When the
slugging starts, I exercise my
right to yawn ‘and retreat to
my fireplace. It crackles com-
fortingly, and only oc-
casionally shoots out a spark
that it really can’t help
releasing. It keeps its head
(and teaches me a good bit
about keeping mine) when
everyone about me is losing |
theirs. A gentle friend when
gentle words: are at a
premium.

Objections to the spirit of
compromise and_ sane
dialogue are inevitable. After
all, why not fight fire with
fire? If officials don’t respond
to reason, then what are we
left to fight with? How will
wrongs be redressed?

Because, my dear Watson,
when fire. is fought with fire,
everyone loses. We are
polarized, we resent, we
become quick to accuse and
hesitate to ever listen.
Vitriolic passions reign. .

I’m seeing victims already,
One is this friend whose tal-
ents are now all his own after
turning his back on the
barking. The loss is his and
ours.

I seem to remember a prin-
ciple called turning the other
cheek. Why be so quick to slap
back? No one says you have to
like every minute here. Turn
your back when passions boil
over and retreat to a fireplace.
There’s something to be said
for the power of positive
example.

atmosphere of Baglased during

can. be drawn from the
following exchange. Lytton
Strachey, an historian of
biting wit, was asked by the
C.O. examiner the classic

Rowe Questions Hierarchy Of Values,
Canterbury Retires After Three Years

To the Editor:

Recently, our 1973-74 an-
nuals, which most of us were
— patiently awaiting, were

to have arrived.
Eowever. they did not arrive
due to ‘‘an act of by
the office of the president’’ (as
our elected and self-appointed
student leaders so aptly put it
in a news letter dated Oct. 22).

As many students will agree

achieved to a large degree; at
least in thought, if not in ac-

over a couple of ‘‘ob-

question in my mind: just

College has followed a policy
of denying non-Christians

This seems to be a gross
form ;of discrimination not

but are in essence
eliminated from Davidson

seems to be in conflict with the
Christian ‘golden rule.”
