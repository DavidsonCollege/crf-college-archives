Cable Wells Begins
Tenure as Admissions Dean

By Meg Davis

Nancy Cable Wells, the new
Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid, brings to Davidson extensive
experience in several aspects of
campus life and administration.
Davidson will also gain national
attention through her work on the
Washington D.C. - based Council
for the Advancement and Support
of Education. Cable Wells began
her tenure at Davidson on July 6 in
therecently renovated Grey House.

In addition to her work as Dean
of Admission, Cable Wells will be
representing the-nine - state Dis-
trict III ona CASE advisory com-
mission on student recruitmentand
retention. She will be required to
mcet with the seven other national
CASE representatives twice this
year to assist in developing work-
books and resource books for ad-
missions professionals. Topics for
the commission will be financial
aid and the discrepancies between
available funds and increasing re-
quests for financial aid. Effective
and ineffective methods of student
recruitment and enrollment man-
agement will also be considered
by the commission.

She also taught three ses-
sions on student recruitment and
enrollment. management this past
summerataCASE conference held
at American University. Two of
her sessions, on recruiting minor-
ity students and the effective usage
of volunteers, have particular per-

tinence for Davidson, according to
Cable Wells.

Coming to Davidson from her
position as Guilford College’sdean
of students and vice president for
student development and enroll-
ment management, Cable Wells
had tremendous success with mi-
nority recruitment on a five year
plan. “We met or exceeded our
goals for African - American re-
cruitment during that time, ending
up with 10 percent representation
in our freshman class,” she said.

‘Interms of Davidson’s recruit-
ment of African - American stu-
dents, Cable Wells feels it must be
a clear effort on the part of the
entire Davidson community. She
is also asking for her staff to be
vigilant at renewing African -
American recruitment in the Char-
lotte area and at increasing the
number of prospects, the names
coming to Davidson through the
college board. A publication on
the African - American experience
at Davidson and. an increase in
financial aid opportunities are her
other ideas for attracting African -
American students.

Based on demographics,
Cable Wells thinks a three year
recruitment plan would be more
appropriate for Davidson since they
are currently recruiting the class of
1997. A three year plan would
take Davidson through the year
