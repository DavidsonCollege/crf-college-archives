DOLE’S WORK CONTINUES

FOOTBALL SEASON may be over, but Coach Bill
Dole’s work has just begun. The Wildcat mentor left this
week in search of high schoo! football talent who may be
interested in coming to Davidson next year. :

Dole has his work cut out for him. Recruiting is not
an easy task for Wildcat coaches. High school kids tend
to be more easily persuaded by big name schools and!
more money. And yet. there seems to be a rise in intellec- !
tual interest by today’s voung people—even the athletes. |
Ask Lefty Driesell, who recently told a Rotary Club meet-,
ing in Charlotte, “You have to offer a boy a good educa- |
tion, as well as an athletic scholarship today.”

Last Saturday's game concluded Dole’s tenth season!
at the Davidson helm. Participating in a conference in:
which the average enroilment of the other eight. schools
is 4.225 Wavidson has 975 students), Dole has compited ;
a respectable record of 36 wins. 50 losses. and 1.tie. Of:
the seven Southern Conference coaches who have been-

jn the league more than oné sear, Dole has the 4th best:
won-lost percentage (420). ile has produced:a winning”

team five times’a {on vears, and this season-he broke .

Joe Teefey (Richmond); guards, Ed Harrington (Citadel)
and Claude Davis (Furman); center, Don Christman (Rich-
mond); quarterback, Bill Canty (Furman); halfbacks, Earl
Stoudt (Richmond) and Dick Drummond (GW), and full-
back Tom Campbell (Furman). Best prospects from David-
son to make second team or honorable mention include
tackle Bill Salzer, center Bruce Usher, end-halfback
Jerry Sheffield, quarterback Earl Cole, and halfback
Alex Gibbs.

THE CRYSTAL BALL

Last week’s perfect score of 8 rights, 0 wrongs push-
ed our crystal ball’s season record to 37-18. With only six
games remaining to be played by conference teams,
we'll have to have another perfect ballot to reach the
.700 mark, a respectable average in this year of upsets.
So we see the final games of 1961 as follows:

Furman Coach Bob King says he can beat Clemson
in Death Valley this Saturday, but we don’t believe him.

Pick the Tigers by 28-12. Other games this weekend: The
Citadel 91. Arkansas St. 15; GW 15, VPI 14; and Indiana

14, West Virginia 6.

On Thanksgiving Day, we see Richmond 35, William
& Mary 13; and VPI 7, VMI 0 ini their traditional clash.

Davidson fans had plenty
to cheer. about last Saturday
afternoon as (they: watched
an inspired Wildcat footliall
team thoroughly «whin a
talented. Wofford club, 34
13.

Coach Bill Dole’s team was
not to be denied of: an even
won-lost record this year as
they were last. season. Going in-
to the final game a year ago,
the 'Cats had a record and blew
a chance to break even when
Furman scored two TD’s with
less than five minutes to play
for a 22-21 comeback victory.

But this year was different.
A Charlotte-Mecklenburg Day
crowd of 5,500 witnessed a re-
juvensted Wildcat offense,
spark by quarterback Earl Cole’s
passing, halfback Jerry Shef-
field’s running, and fullback Jim
Fuller’s running, amass a grand
total of 449 yards.

In addition, an inspired de-
fensive unit, spearheaded by
Mickie Slaughter, Bill Salzer,
Eddie Crutchfield, Russell
Walls, and Bruce Usher, limited
the highly-touted Terrier of.
fense to a mere 28 yards rush-
ing.

And so a Davidson team that
had the potential to explode all
season finally did. Had it done
so a little earlier, this year
might have been a winning sea-
son.

Although 13 seniors depart
from this year’s squad, Dole has
some excellent material return-
ing. Among the top returnees
will be Cole, Fuller, and Alex
Gibbs in the backfield, with
Slaughter, Crutchfield, Walls,

the final and probably the

football game in the college career of. Jerry Shef-

field, senior halfback from Sebring, Fla.

In a game thal saw excellent

West Virginia's Raynor Baldwin | performances by several players

Sterling Martin.

Davidson finished fifth last
year and Coach Heath Whittle
expects little if no advancement
on Monday. Martin, who was
8th a year ago, is the ‘Cats’
brightest hope.
