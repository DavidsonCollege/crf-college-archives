THE DAVIDPHONIAN

Student Health Center Built; College Community Vexed

Christopher Smart

After years of incomprehen-
sive, crowded, and frankly, dang
sorry medical care at the infirmary
on Concord Road, Davidson Col-
lege has made an about face with
construction of the new Student
Health Center on Glasgow Street.

Lying directly across from
Smith House, the new medical
center, according to College phy-
sician Karl Barkley, is built on a
three-pronged premise: “Bigger
waiting rooms, more People maga-
zines, faster virus diagnoses.”

“Let’s face it. What do
Davidson students get around here?
I don’t see anybody contracting
malaria, for God’s sake. They get
little viruses and colds and stuff.
We want students to be able to
come in, take their Drixoral, and
get the hell out. Simple as that,”

By J. Alfred Prufrock

The Select Committee on
Whatever We Want announced
today that it had found the Kappa
Sigma fraternity guilty onall counts
of drug trafficking. Several days
ago, after investigating the house’s
suspicious display of used kegs on
its porch, detectives discovered

Barkley blustered.

He went on to say: “If there’s
anything I hate it’s these whiny
little rich kids claiming some kind
of rare tropical fever when all they
are is hung over. Let me tell you
something, kid. I was getting rare
tropical diseascs in ‘Nam before
you were old enough to spell TB,
so don’t give me any crap about
your exotic disorders. That is not
what the new Student Health Cen-
ter is all about. As I said before:
bigger waiting rooms, more People
magazines, faster virus diagnoses.”

Student reaction to the doc-
tor’s comments has been mixed
thus far. Former SGA president
Cammie Covington said: “Yeah,
well, we passed a resolution ap-
proving this center last fall. I rilly
think that’s what set it in motion.
The SGA issuch a powerful tool if

in the basementandat first thought
it was only a vanity thing. You
know, ‘Look how much beer we
can drink.” But then, while rou-
tinely checking up on the frater-
nity, we realized they wouldn’t let
us into the basement,” said head
investigator Russell Snapp.

Athletic department officials
were not so pleased, however.
Apparently the cost of the new
infirmary has put a serious dent in
the athletic budget for next year.
Speaking on condition of anonym-
ity, the source said: “How’s Azzo
gonna hit all his dingahs next year
if we can’t keep him comfortable
with all the Twinkics he can eat?
Maybe you don’t realize it but
they’re gonna be the first things to
goif they build that namby-pamby
medical thing. This thing has got to
be stopped.”

After further explanation,
though, the source seemed to rec-
oncile himself to the inevitable,

cal practice as we know it in the
twentieth century.

Weare disturbed that the words
mentioned in the first paragraph
are becoming more common in the
conversations about Davidson
students. Wake up! You people
arcn’t stupid. Good behavior in

You might as well do whatever

hours. It was revealed that the
apparently empty kegs had been
used to distribute the drugs, which
where then sold on the street by
members of F.L.A.G. attempting
to fund their new charter. The total
street value of the drugs was six-
teen million dollars, which raised
the question presented by the prose-
cutor, John Howell, “Why don’t
they have more parti¢s?” The
Honor Council passed its recom-

endation to the adminastration at "
noon, and the.residing judge, Dr.
John Kuykendall named the sen-
tcce at one p.m. The Kappa Sigs
were given a one week probation, _
told they had to clean up the presi-
dent’s house, and promised the
school’s full co-operation in the
state’s suit against the fraternity.
Kuykendall was heard to say later,
“They have dry rush so we let them
off easy.”
