tainly, though, the headline was
not an attempt to demean the ef-
forts of the football team. All that
I was really trying to do was to
avoid a boring, typical headline.
The opening sentence of the
article (which described the loss to

Rhodes as a second straight “¢on= ~ that it was in ho way my intention

that statement. The football team
(andeveryoneelse, for that matter)
has every right to expect fair and

'Cats Overwhelmed by "Bigger"

Emory & Henry Squad,

By Chris Hood

Looking at Davidson’s 1992
football schedule, the four Sep-
tember contests are undoubtedly
the cornerstone of the slate.
Guilford, the University of the
South, Rhodes andEmory & Henry
were a combined 29-7-2 in 791.

The ‘Cats found once again.

how strong their early-season op-
ponents are this Saturday in front
of a Parents’ Weekend crowd of
2,447. Emory & Henry outplayed
the ‘Cats from the beginning in
drubbing the home team 36-7 and
dropping Davidson to 1-3.
“They were a lot bigger than
"we were, and they were very well-
coached,” widereceiver John Bod-
kin said, who had Davidson’s lone
touchdown of the afternoon, said
of the Wasps. E&H, now 4-0, was
eighteenth in the nation in this
week’s USA Today Division III
poll.

Given the Wasps*amazing of-
fensive success this season,
Davidson’s performance does not
appear as discouraging. Going into
the match at Davidson, E&H was
averaging 53 points per game, and
its average margin of victory wasa
whopping 42 points.

E&H opened the scoring mid-
way through the first quarter when
Cary Perkins lofted an 18-yard
touchdown pass to John Ely. Five
minutes later, Charles Cole
punched through the Davidson line
for a three-yard score.

Todd Woodall caught Perkins’
second touchdown pass of the
game, a 19-yard strike which put
the Wasps up 21-0. After a wild
sequence in which Davidson quar-
terback Richard Howell was inter-
cepted twice: and the Wasps
fumbled once and were picked off
once in just three plays, the visi-
tors’ defense held the “Cats to set
up their fourth score of the half.
Todd Lee carried the ball on five of
seven plays and scored froma yard
out with 3:17 left in the half; Jay
Garnett’s extra point was blocked
by Charles Staples, and E&H en-
joyed a 27-0 lead at the half.

The Wasps took advantage of
the opening drive of the second
half, advancing 42 yards in 10 plays
and earning three points on a 41-
yard field goal by Garnett. Their
final score of the afternoon came
with 11:27 remaining in the con-
test; Chad Krantz pounded into
Davidson’s defensive line three
straight times before scoring from
a yard out. Chris Leak blocked the
extra point, but the Wasps were up
36-0 by this point.

With time running out in the
final stanza, the ‘Cats managed
one solid drive for thehomecrowd.
Howéll engineered a 73-yard drive
which featured a 20-yard comple-
tion to Isaac Bailey and a 14-yard
scramble by. the quarterback, after
which he was illegally hit out of
bounds. As the clock closed inside
of three-and-a-half minutes,

36-7

Howell spotted Bodkin in the left
corner of the end zone 29 yards
away; Drew Fassett’s extra point
banked off the new scoreboard,
and the ‘Cats had cut the margin to
36-7.

The Wasps dominated the
‘Cats in nearly every category
imaginable. They held the ball for
18 more minutes, 38:54-21:06,
tripled Davidson in first downs,
22-7, and gained 479 yards of total
offense to Davidson’s 145. E&H
quarterback Perkins, who was
given plenty of time by his offen-
sive line, picked apart the ‘Cat
secondary on 12 of 21 passing for
242 yards and a pair of touch-
downs. Meanwhile, Davidson sig-
nal-callers were under constant
pressure; Howell completed eight
of 24 attempts for 121 yards and
the touchdown while being sacked
five times and intercepted once.
Kevin Holzworth was zero for eight
with two interceptions and a sack.

There is solace in the fact that

the most difficult portion of the *

schedule is complete. Rhodes and
E&H are unquestionably two of
the strongest squads in the region.

“We can’t give up now,” Bodkin .
explained. “We have the power-—

houses behind us, and now we’re
looking forward to the rest of our
schedule.” Davidson is off this
weekend, and Homecoming
against Washington and Lee,
whom the ‘Cats topped 16-14 last
season, is two weeks away.

cus. The Wildcats then changed
their game plan from small passes
to big hits in order to slow the
Rams down even more. Instead of
trying to tie the game, VCU played
the last 14 minutes as if they had
already lost the game. During that
time, the Wildcats had six offen-
sive comers, the Rams just one.

The day after the win over
VCU, Davidson headed to Boone
to face Appalachian State. The 1-0
win over the Mountaineers was
also momentous for the ‘Cats be-
cause it marked their first win ever
on an artificial turf field.

This was the first turf game
for the Wildcats, and it took them
the entire first half to get used to
the pace of the ball. As.was the
case in the VCU game, the first
half produced no goals for either
team. Freshman Holly Kledis broke

the scoring drought with her first
collegiate goal with her family
and friends in attendance. Kiedis
said, “I received the ball from Jill
{Bennett} and I was able to flick it
past the goalie to the rightside of
the cage. Then everybody came
running towards me, I couldn’t
believe it. I was really psyched.”

Davidson’s shutout of the
Mountaineers was the team’s third
in a row.

“T was pleased with the way
the team pulled themselves to-
gether in the second half after a
sluggish first half,” said coach
Pryor. “‘A key factor to our suc-
cess is the strong leadership from
the senior and junior classes.”

The Wildcats travelled to Ath-
ens, Ohio over Parents’ Weekend
to face Ohio University, Kent State
and Central Michigan. Davidson
downed Ohio University 2-1 on
Friday. The team’s next home
game is Saturday, October 3 at
1:00 p.m against University of
Richmond.
