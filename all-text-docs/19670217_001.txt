ONE MORE GIRL
Judy Collins Leads Female Invasion

Girls, Rain Inundate Campus Weekend

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Steff Writer

Hundreds of beautiful dates
and the anticipation of concerts,
dances and parties brought a
long-awaited smile to Davidson
students as Midwinters ‘67 ar-
rived with the threat of more
rain and colder weather.

The annual influx of girls for
this weekend began for some as
early as last night and will con-
tinue through tomorrow, al-
though Mrs. Harmon Gillespie,
assistant supervisor of dormi-
tories, reported that “there
might not be as many female
visitors as usual this year."

There will, however, be a suf-
ficient number to transform the
college from an intellectual ha-
ven jnto a gay aura of happiness
and relaxation.

The Social Council will spon-
sor both a dance and a concert,
and will present both rock-and-
rol} and folk groups for those
who like a little diversity in
their musical entertainment.

This lively weekend will begin
off campus tonight at the Lake
Norman House. of Music, where
the Impressions of “Keep On
Pushing” fame will alternate
performances with the Show-
men to provide four hours of
continuous rock-'n'-roll enter-
tainment. The dance will begin
at 8 p.m. and ‘last until 12 p.m.

The Impressions are a well-

known group whose other hits
include ‘‘Amen,"’ Gypsy Wom
an," “It’s All Right,”’ “I'm So
Proud” and their latest hit,
“You Always Hurt Me.’' The
Showmen have always been a
big group. but they have just
recently gotten a big name with
their hit °'39-21-46."

If any tickets remain for this
show, the will be sold at the
door for $2 a person. There is a
limit of 1,700 persons which can
be admitted to the House of
Music. Maps will be posted in
each fraternity house and in the
Union.

Saturday night will feature
folk singer Judy Collins, who
was rated the number two fe-
male folk artist of 1966 by “‘Bill-
bodrd'’s Music on Campus.’ She
will give a concert in Chambers
Auditorium, lasting from 8 p.m.
to 10 p.m. and open only to Da-
vidson students and their dates.

She is best known on the West,

‘Union Coffee House

Coast, where she presents most
of her concerts. Her present sin-
gle hit is ‘“‘Hard Loving Loser,"
while her latest album. ‘‘In My
Life,” is the current number
two selling folk album.
Additional musical entertain-
ment will be provided both Sat-
urday afternoon and late Satur-

will make a second appearance
on Saturday night in the Morri-

his original folk songs. There
will be no seats for the show:
everyone will simply have to
find a spot on the floor.

There will also be movies
shown in the Morrison Room
both Friday and Saturday nights,

“pecording to Vince Foster,
president of the Social Council,
“This promises to be a very ex-
citing weekend here at Davidson
because of the variety and the
top-notch entertainment we have
obtained.

“The admission which stu-
dents have to pay to hear the
Impressions will be the only ad-
ditional charge made on them
this semester. Usually the Fri-
day night entertainment during
Midwinters is provided by the
Artist Series, but we decided to
take it this year and thus have
to cover the overhead. Also the
Social Council provided one ex-
tra concert earlier in February
which had to come out of our
budget.

“The reason we are not spon-
soring a combo parfy at the

lack of popular demand. In a
poll conducted earlier in the
year, students failed to support
combo parties. Also, since many
of the fraternities’ parties will
be open, we felt the need would
be sufficiently met in this way.

“The Lake Norman House of
Music has a very large stage.”’
added Westray Battle, a mem-
ber of the Social Cuoncil, ‘‘which
should greatly enhance the ef-
fectivenes of the show Friday
night.”’

All this weekend's fraternity
parties will be open, with the ex-
ception of three, where space
does not permit. Two of the
three are tonight: that of the
Kappa Sigs, SAE’s, KA's and
Betas. and that of the ATO’'s.
Phi Delts and Pikas.

tendance Wednesday night.
Herb Jackson, creator and

master of ceremonies of UCH!,

" expressed pleasure over the re-

sponse given to his brain-child
on opening night.

Despite distracting noise from |

the area of the snack bar, the
over 120 students who wandered
in for Dews’ first show seemed
to enjoy the show. according to
one observer.

Every Wednesday night from
10-12 p.m. in the Union cafe-
teria UCH! will feature a guest
performer. Performers sched-
uled for the following weeks are
Mike Ratcliffe with the new Sa-
lem Trio, Bob Dugger. and Dave
McCorkle.

Jackson said. “We are also
planning a ‘speaker's spot’ dur-
ing a break in the entertainment
where a person can state an

opinion and then there can be
debate on the issue.’ Jackson
also mentioned the purchasing of
an expresso machine.

Jackson called this innovation
an “instant coffee house’ be-
cause its schedule can be chang-
ed as he sees fit.

“‘We hope that UCH! will be
continued and receive a budget
of its own.’ Jackson stated.

UCH! charges no admission to
the weekly shows which give
anyone who wants to perform an
opportunity to display his tal-
ents before a non-captive audi-
ence.

Jackson said, ‘‘I proposed the
coffee house because there is
nothing going on in Davidson
during the middle of the week.”

Working with Jackson are Bill
Norfleet, production manager.
and a general crew consisting
of John Liipfert on lights, Paul
Pitts on sound, William Norman,
Jim White, and Bill Farr.

and Phi Delts.

“This program will occupy all
the classrooms in the other
buildings,"’ Johnston explained.
Consequently, no rooms for sum-
mer school will be available. |

Complications .for eliminating
summer school arise because of
college regulations that make it
mandatory for students in cer-
tain type of academic difficulty
to attend summer school on the
Davidson campus.

The details involved in solving
these complications have not
been worked out, but, he said.
“we'll make it as simple as pos-
sible.”

There has been speculation for
several years that summer
school would be abloished be-
cause of declining enrollment
and subsequent financial losses.

“There is a possibility of com-
pletely doing away with summer
school,’* Johnston said, ‘‘but the
decision to have none this sum-
mer has nothing to do with this.
It will have to be decided at a
later time."

He pointed out that. certain ad-
vantages. particularly air con-
ditioning. might make summer
school more, rather than less,
attractive in future summers.

Cost For Project
Set At $500,000

A $500,000 renovation of the
inside of Chambers Building will
begin in June. and will be com-
pleted by the opening of the fall
term in September.

The project was announced
Tuesday at the faculty's Febru-
ary meeting.

Half the cust of the project will
be involved in air conditioning
the building. This system will
be installed in a manner which
could handle future changes in
room sizes. The system would
employ heat control by floors
and wings of floors.

The hallways will be modern-
ized to include accoustical ceil-
ings and some way to limit hall
noise from walking. possibly by
carpeting the halls. Better light-
ing will be installed, and provi-
sions will be made for using first
floor hallways for art displays
and providing adequate bulletin
board and display cases.

Plans call for the installation
of a telephone in each faculty
office and a central switchboard,
probably located in an area ad-
jacent to the faculty distribution
boxes in the Alumni Office.

Classrooms will! be complete.
ly reworked, including new fur-
niture, improved ceilings. floors.
and blackboards, plus necessary
electrical outlets, movie screens
and venetian blinds for the utili-
zation of audio-visual aids. Plat-
forms will be removed in all but
the largest classrooms.

Students
Request
Local Club

A number of students have
started a petition aimed at es-
tablishing an eating club on
campus, to be known as the
Campus Club.

According to the petition, it is
to “provide a place to eat, a
social outlet, a place for other
activities, and whose member-
ship will be open to all students
of Davidson College."

The organizing committee con-
sists of Franklin Anderson, Rob-
in Gottfried, Dan Vinson and
Don Hoyt, To this will be added
five others selected by those
signing the petition.

This new committee will draft
a constitution for the Campus
Club, subject to the approval of
the petitioners. It will also elect
the organization's officers. ;

Although the organizers are all
freshmen, approximately half of
the signers were upperclassmen.
Several faculty members have

_|expressed interest in the proj-

ect.

A spokesman for the group

;said the organization is being

formed because ‘for’ the past
several years there has been a
feeling on the campus that there
exists the need for social oppor-
tunities provided by an open-
Mmembership eating club-social
organization."

Outstanding Bids
May Now Be Valid

The Interfraternity Council
voted Wednesday night to allow
outstanding fraternity bids to re-
main valid so long as the fra-
ternity wishes.

The old rule stated that fresh.
men not accepting bids on the
day specified would have to wait
until the first week in April.

The change leaves the length
of time outstanding dates will be
valid up to the individual fra-
ternity.

In other business, Feb. 28 was
set as the date for election of
officers for 1967-68.
