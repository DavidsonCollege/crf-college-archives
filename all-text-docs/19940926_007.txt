Honor Code: On Trial

Recently, the SGA established an ad-hoc committee on the honor system to answer
concerns that the Honor Code’s presence isn’t felt on campus as strongly as it used to be.
The committee will look into many facets of our honor system, but the basic question we
all need to consider is this: Do students still respect the Honor Code?

We think not. Not the way they should, at least. Typical Davidson students do not
have contempt for the Honor Code, but it is not a part of their lives as it needs to be to work

properly. As importantas itis to the life of ourcollege, the unfortunate truth isthatstudents~

just don’t think about the Honor Code enough.

Our experience as newspaper editors has taught us that it takes a lot to get somebody’s
attention. It is difficult to force students to think about the code every single day, but the
Honor Council needs to take measures to bring the code back to the forefront of our minds.

We could take lessons from Washington and Lee about how to do this. They require
that students write out the honor pledge on every paper and test. They have a copy of the
pledge hanging in every classroom. Students there are afraid of the wrath of the Honor
Council, but at Davidson, that feeling most often fades by the end of freshman year. At
W&L, the Honor Code is a felt presence on campus, and at Davidson, it is not.

Our Honor Code has faded not because Davidson students are less honest than they
used to be. It is our day-to-day awareness of the code that has faded, and fortunately, that
is something we can bring back. Butif we recognize the problem and fail to institutionalize
a change, then we are compromising our moral integrity.

The next few months are crucial to the future of Davidson College as we know it. As
the SGA and the Honor Council examine Davidson’s moral system, the entire community
needs to become aware of our waning regard: for honor and ask itself an unpleasant

question: Is the Honor Code still the backbone of Davidson College, or have we lost our _,

spine?

Confederate flag is inflamatory symbol

To the editors,

I would like to sin-
cerely express my appre-
ciation to Ike Bailey for
contributing his recent edi-
torial, “How important is
the Confederate flag?” to

the Davidsonian. I would
like to add that although sla-
very was not the central is-
sue of the Civil War, the flag
has indeed been used by the

KKK and white supremacist,
groups to symbolize their

message, and everyone
should be sensitive to what
feelings that fact may and
should arouse.

Sincerely,
Kimberly Kreiling '96

Another financial proposal

To the editors,

é Recently, the SGA
was challenged with the
difficult problem of a new
outdoor basketball court.
Reflecting on the many
problems associated with
this challenging proposal,
we have come up with a

suggestion. We think we
should take all the money
allocated for the construc-
tion of the on-campus post
office, the co-ed eating
house, the new Union (the
One we were promised as
perspectives), the new track,
andthe basketball courts, and

build an underground park-
ing garage below Richardson
Field. Now that's something
worthwhile.

Two concerned
students,
Bruce Bannister '95
and Kevin Miller '95

Best to Dress as if Your Life

Somewhere out there, a
young man is reading this.
Ah yes—there you are.
Whoever you are, wherever
you're sitting orstanding, this
one's for you.

Yes, you.

Idon'tknow your name.
I have no idea where you
live, what schools you've
attended, what you want to
do with your life:

But I'm going to give
you some advice: Tonight,
tomorrow, the next time
you're in a position to, do
yourself a favor.

Wear a condom.

Wait. Before you turn
back to the Sports section or
drop the paper entirely, I'll
admit the obvious. For most
guys, wearing a rubber dur-
ing sex doesn't feel as good
as going "bareback." I've
heard some guys joke that
it's like "making love with a
glove."

Now, I'm no man. But
as a twice-married. woman,
the sister of three men and
the best female buddy of sev-
eral more, I've heard enough
men talk straight-up about
sex to know this:

With acondom, sex still
feels good. So good that you
are going to want to feel that
way, over and over, for many
years to come.

Which brings: me to
what's making acloset prude
like me speak so brazenly to
a stranger. A front-page ar-
ticle from Wednesday's
Washington Post, that's

Depended on it

what.

It stated that AIDS has
surpassed homicide to be-
come the leading killer of
black men age 25 to 44 inthe
Washington area, according
to local health officials. be-
fore young white guys get
comfy, they should know
that according to Centers for
Disease Control epidemiolo-
gist Richard Selik, AIDS has
become the leading cause of
death nationally for all men
in the age group, ‘based on

‘provisional data for 1992.

The disease is spreading
faster among heterosexuals.

Bottom line: More
young men are dying from
sex and drugs—the primary
ways of spreading the blood-
and-fluid-borne disease—
than from bullets.

That's saying some-
thing.

Once upon a time, the
chief killer of young guys
practically everywhere was
car crashes: and other acci-
dents. After that, heart dis-
ease. (That's still true in
much of the United States.)
Young men died from the
kind of stuff that devastated
family members could say
was "God's will.... Itcouldn't
be helped."

Nowadays, in places
like D.C., thousands of
young, healthy guys die be-
cause somebody points a
loaded gun and them and
pulls the trigger. Even more
die of Aids.

Like homicide—which

is another column alto-—
gether—AIDS is often about
choices. Itcan be prevented.
By not using intravenous
drugs. And by using some-
thing as cheap, smart and
widely available as a
condom. That's so well pub-
licized, my 8-year-old knows
it.

So why aren't you using
one?

We just dealt with the
feel-good issue. Because
dead guys generally don't
have sex—and you wnat to
have lots of it—it's in your
best interest to stay alive.
Condoms can help.

Perhaps you have a part-
ner problem. Your girlfriend
will hate rubbers or question
your wanting to use one.
Trust me, a woman too dumb
tocomprehend that condoms
protect you and her is some-
one with whom you won't
want to exchange phone
numbers, let alone body flu-
ids. :

I know how it is.

When you get down to
it, only you can protect you,
anyway. And in this crazy,
out-of-control world, this is
one thing you can control.

You're smart and it's
simple.

Buy condoms. Use
them. Live alittle. Got that?

Youcan thank me later.
