Guttmacher Advocates
Abortion Legalization

“IT think we have a moral
obligation to provide a wom
an with the opportunity to
choose whether she wants to
give birth or not,"’ said Dr.
Alan Guttmacher, president
of Planned Parenthood
World Population, in a_ lec-
ture in Perkins Auditorium
Tuesday night.

“For me abortion is not
murder. I. admit it’s some
.thing that hits you in the
gut. Someone who feels it is
murder can't be persuaded
otherwise,” Guttmacher de-
flired.

“And for that matter he
can't change my mind,’’ he
added.

“Wherever abortion has
been introduced, the birth
rate has dropped dramatic-
ally. As the experience of
Bulgaria and Rumania has
shown, we can manipulate
the. birth rate: by changing
the-ease with which a wom
an can get an abortion,”
Guttmacher said,

Guttmacher stated that vol-
untarism has mot been given
an adequate chance to con-
trol the birth rate. ‘It's cheap
to. save lives vet it becomes
very difficult and expensive

College-Owned Organ
To Receive New Collars

Davidson College’s new
Wicks pipe organ will have
gleaming bronze collars add-
ed to about half its 3,576
pipes this summer.

Some 1,800 exposed pipes
will have the new collars in-
stalled by Ralph E. Blakely
Jr., a Davidson alumnus who
tonally finished the new or-
gan, located in the Davidson
College Presbyterian Church.

Martin» Wick, president of
the Wicks Organ Company
of Highland, Il., which built
the college’s instrument, is
donating the slides, valued
at some $2,500, and Blakely
will install them as a free
service to the college.

Since the organ was com-
pleted a year ago, it* has
drawn many visitors, some
as far away as Washington,
D. €., and Boston, Mass.

Paul Creasman, a repre-
sentative of the Wicks Com-
pany in Charlotte, calls it
“one of the finest instru-
ments within 500 miles.’’

It is the only organ in re-
cent years to be desgined ac-
cording to the ‘‘silver. tone”’
concepts of the Baroque or-

gan builder Gottfried Silber-
man, :

Davidson music professor
Wilmer H. Welsh made the
designs for the ‘Wicks Com
pany.

May Reschedule Collins

The College Social Council
will have nearly 8,000 dol
lars extra to spend next
year. \

However, according to
Council
Bruce, the excess will‘ just
cover an anticipated cut of
next year's social budget.

The money was to be used
in bringing folk singer Judy
Collins to WMavidson for
Spring Frolics, held two
weeks ago.

Miss Collins cancelled all
her engagements that week-
end because -she had strep
throat, said Bruce.

to prevent lives.

“You just don’t have the
same motivation for birth
control that you have for
medical treatment, If a wom;
an spits up blood, she'll go
20 miles and take four buses
to get to a doctor. Birth con-
trol can wait until next
week,’ he said.

According to Guttmacher,
the’ source of the present
problem ‘is the spread of
medical technology through-
out the world. ‘Population
growth in its present form is
a relatively new phenome-
non. Since World War II,
death rates, especially in the
developing countries, have
dropped dramatically. Birth
rates, however, have remain-
ed relatively stationary.

“The problem is that peo-
ple reproduce geometrically,
not arithmetically. Fortu-
nately, there are 30 coun-
tries, including most of the

- world’s largest, which have

official policies on birth con-

» trol,’ he said.

Chairman Duff _

In a meeting last Friday,
the social council decided to
save the surplus money for
use next vear.

“Our budget is going to be
cut next year," said Bruce,
“so we will use the: extra
money to make up the dif-
ference. This will enable us

to have the same number of

programs next year as we
did this year, even though
our budget will be less.

“I'm not exactly sure how
much we have to hold over,
but it is a major portion of
the 8,000 dollars.”

Bruce explained that part
of the money was used dur-
ing Spring Frolics.

“‘As soon as we knew that
Judy wasn't coming, we
made the carnival rides and
movie free. We used a small
amount of her money to cov-
er the cost of these activi-
ties,"’ he said,

Bruce discounted the pos-
sibility of having ‘Miss Col-
lins appear at Davidson lat-
er this year.

“There would really be no
sense in trying to get her
back this year,"’ said Bruce.

“We've got enough plan
ned for the rest of this year,
and there really isn't enough
time left in the year to or-

ganize another big week-
end.
“With the girls’ schools

graduating early, and beach
season going on, we wouldn't
want to bring Judy Collins
down here and. risk not fill-
ing the house.”

“IT Know all this year's
seniors are disappointed, but
it would be impractical to
try to schedule anything big
on such short notice.”’

Bruce. also mentioned that
Miss Collins might come
here next year, but he could
give no details,

“We know she can't be
here at Homecoming, so
Midwinters would be the
earliest possible date. We
hope that she will give us
some special consideration
next year, since she’ can-
celled out once,"’ said Bruce.
