TO THE NEW MEN ENTERING

COLLEGE.

We have at Davidson a club called
It’s
motto is “A Bigger and a Better Da-
vidson.” Every student in college is
a member of the club and the day
you enter Davidson you will auto-
matically become a member your-
self. As its motto implies, the club
First, to make Da-
vidson bigger as to numbers, equip-
ment, etc; second, to make it better,
particularly with reference to stu-

the Greater Davidson Club.

has two aims:

dent life, activities and_ relations.

The club has already accomplished a
for the
coming year has plans on foot to im-

number of good things an

prove student life even further.

For a number of years there has
been practically no hazing at Da-
vidson, as the student government
regulations absolutely forbid organ-
there

ized hazing, but occasionall
was some act of an upper-classman

toward a new man that seemed to

the Freshmen to be an act of haz-

ing. Last spring the student body,

acting under the suggestion of the
Greater Davidson Ch
abolish hazing in appearance as well
as in fact. Accordingly, they re-
enacted the anti-hazing clause of the
student government regulations, de-
claring that any student found
guilty of hazing would be expelled
from college instantly. The Sopho-
more class, as a body, passed a reso-
lution endorsing the student body
action, and expressing their full sup-
port of it. Several mild student dis-
tinctions for new men such as were
in effect last session, and to which
there was no objection, remain, but
no form of hazing will be permitted.
I am giving this information to
the new men that they may know in
advance something of the spirit and
attitude of Davidson students to-
ward new men. You will be given a
cordial welcome and be treated in a
most friendly manner. I want to
ask, however, that you, on your part,
meet this friendly spirit in the right
way yourself. It is good for a new
man coming to any strange place,
to hold himself somewhat in reserve,
and to wait for recognition. No
matter how prominent and success
ful a leader you. may have been in
your high school, do not try to run

ub, decided to

first enter college. Keep yourself
somewhat in the background in col-
lege affairs, and let your manner be
that of a man who is sure he is
among friends, but does not assume
authority or privileges. Be a learn-
er and a listener. If you have merit
an ability to lead, you will be rec-
ognized in due time and the honors
and popularity that come to you will
be all the more firmly established.
Bear these suggestion¥ in mind,
and from the beginning of your col-
lege career be a loyal member of
the Greater Davidson Club and try
to do your part toward making stu-
dent relations happy and pleasant.
The students, of Davidson believe
that their college is already the best
to be found, but they want to make
it even better. The Greater David-
son Club invites you to take part in
this splendid work.
J. M. McCONNELL,
Faculty Representative
Greater Davidson Club.

VIDSON CLUB FOR THE
SUMMER.

(Too late for last issue)

First: To represent the David-
son spirit and ideals in the com-
munity and town where we spend
our vacation.

Second: To bring with us when
we return to college next year a new
student, or, if we do not return, to
send a new student in our place.

Third: To visit and explain to
any prospective student in our town
or community all we can about the

[~

college when requested to do so by
the President’s office.

Fourth: To see to it that at least
450 students enroll at Davidson next
September.

Lack of dormitory space prevents
our making the number 500.

The officers and leaders of The
Greater Davidson Club were very
much gratified at the action taken
by the next year’s Sophomore Class
resolving that every member of the
class will do his utmost to enforce
the student body regulations forbid-
ding hazing at Davidson College.
This means that hazing has heen
abolished by the students of the col-
ege,

TION OF MEN ENTERING
UPON THEIR FIRST YEAR IN
COLLEGE.

Though Greek has been for sev-
eral years past elective at David-
son, it continues to be none the less
an essential element in the makeup
of a complete and rounded educa-
tion in the judgment not simply of
Greek professors but of thousands
of college trained men who occupy
the vantage ground of wide and
long experience and observation in
the educational, literary and scien-
tific world and who insist that no
matter what is to be his profession
later in life, the boy entering col-
lege makes a great mistake if he
does not study Greek for certainly
one, not to say, two years.

A few of the reasons given for
this opinion may be briefly stated:

(1) Nothing is superior to Greek
as furnishing a mental gymnastic,
the heresy of the new psychology to
the contrary.

(2) Greek makes such a large con-
tribution to the English language
that no man can have a proper ap-
preciation of a large fraction of
words in his own English tongue
that does not know something about
Greek. Scientific nomenclature is
practically all Greek.

(3) Greek thought in philosophy
and in literature is the very basis
and foundation upon which the mod-
erns have builded their own, indeed
the Greek may be termed the very
warp and woot of mental science and
literature as studied today, and to
know the modern it is all important
that the student first learn the
Greek, and . ;

(4) As a corallary of this, it may
be added that the “continuity of
learning” makes imperative an ac-
quaintance with this the greatest of
the ancient languages.

(5) A knowledge of Greek is the
sine qua non of admission into that
great and almost uncounted broth-
erhood of educated men, a fratern-
ity whose history runs far back into
the centuries. Greek is the open
sesame in fact the only passport by
which one can enter this society of
the select and highly favored among
mankind. C. R. H

things, nor be prominent when you}/PLANS OF THE GREATER DA- |FOR THE SPECIAL CONSIDERA-| ABSENCE REGULATIONS.

1. Absence from any college duty
will be unexcused unless the Dean
or College Physician gives permis-
sion beforehand.

2. Chapel as well as Church ab-
sence will be counted hereafter as
equivalent to recitation absences. A
total of only six unexcused absences
will be allowed without discipline
therefor.

3. For each unexcused absence
from any class and for each excused
absence above three during the first
term or five during the second term
from any class, the grade of the
student in that class shall be lower-
ed by one. The excused absence al-
lowed without penalty shall be in-

‘creased to ten where at least five

during the first term or seven during
the second term are due to the pro-
tracted illness of the student, certi-
fied to by the College Physician, or
to absence as a member of a college
organization representing the col-
lege away from town.

4. No so-called “blanket requests”
by parents for permission to be ab-
sent will be honored. Specific writ-
ten requests must be made for each
permission.

THE GREATER DAVIDSON
CLUB WORKS.

By mid-summer the number of
new students definitely lined up had
reached 150. If registration had not
been checked by letter and by ad-
vertisement we no doubt would
have gone well beyond 300 new men.
Again we say the Greater Davidson
Club works.

Bad News From Pat.

“Good morning, Miss I’ve just had
very bad news about my son Pat. He
has been killed in action.”

“Oh, I'm very sorry,” said the Red
Cross Home Seryice worker, “did you
receive word from the War Depart-
ment?”

“No, miss, I received word from him-
self.”

The Home Service worker looked per-
plexed and said, “But how is that?”

“Sure,” replied the mother, “here is the |
letter. Read it for yourself.”

The letter said, “Dear mother, I am
now in the Holy Land.”—Ex.
