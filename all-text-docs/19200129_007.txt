schools, Judge Osborne entered the

son, from which he graduated in

borne practiced his profession in

borne was elected mayor of the city.
and four years later was clected
solicitor of the Sixth judicial dis-
trict. In 1892 he was elected attor-
ney general of North Carolina, serv-
ing four vears. He was unanimous-
ly endorsed for re-election, but was
defeated by the combination of re-
publicans and populists in 1896, The
same vear he was elected to the
State segate. :

President Roosevelt appointed
Judge Osborne as one of the United
States Court of Land Claims, which
position he held for three years, his
duties taking him to Santa Fee, N.

came up. [t was an enviable fame
which the late Judge Osborne en-
joyed among North Carolina people.
for it was the fame that comes to
one who is recognized of pre-cemi-
nent talents in his chosen profes-
sion,

“Judge Osborne’s predominant
characteristic was his rugged sense
of honor... Men of his type and
ideals once numerous in the South
have hecome few, and the legal pro-
fession ‘is the poorer for their pass-
ing.”

WILLIAM WOODHULL WOOD.

University of Virginia Graduate
Holds Professorship at Davidson.

William Woodhull Wood was first
heard from of June 30, 1888, some-
where in the neighborhood of the
town of Woodrow Wilson, George
Washington, and Robert FE. Lee.
After completing his high school
course he entered the University of
Virginia in 1905, graduating four
years later with an A.B, degree, hav-
ing distinguished himself by becom-
ing a member of the Phi Beta Kappa
fraternity. Continuing his work at
the same institution, he was grad-
uated as civil engineer in 1912.

After the completion of his uni-
versity course, Professor Wood
was employed for a time by the KE. 1.
Du Pont-De Nemours Co., and by
the Southern Railway, also engaging
in some outside private work. Com-
ing to Davidson in 1915, he has con-
tinued his services here since that
time as professor of Applied Mathe-
matics, Geology, and Astronomy.

During the five years of his work
at Davidson, Professor Wood has
been always the same carefully pre-
pared and scholarly accurate profes-
sor in his classroom and the same

genial friend in his general inter--

course with the students. Though
not an alumnus of Davidson, he is
very truly in harmony with the
spirit of the college, contributing in
a very important way to the life on
the campus and in town.
