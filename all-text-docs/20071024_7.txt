“A crazy thriller about extreme characters
going to extraordinary, perverted lengths for
love.”

That's how Director Mark Sutch describes
the Theater Deparment's fall production of
Women Beware Women.

“It's a story about two young women who
are in love but are then corrupted by the
world around them,” Sutch said. “One has
just eloped with a poor merchant, but, while
he is away from home, she is seduced by a
rich duke. The other, who is trying to avoid
an arranged marriage, has an uncle who is
desperately in love with her, and he con-
vinces her they are not related so they can

start an affair. Once all the deceptions are
uncovered, however, the characters start to
plot revenge on each other.”

Written by Thomas Middleton in the early
17th century, Women Beware Women deals
with sexual perversion and violence in a
manner remarkably ahead of its time.

“Part of the reason I chose this play was its
universality,” Sutch explained. “The text is
400 years old but addresses themes still rele-
vant to a modern audience.”

Sutch admitted that he's loved the play
since he first read it in college. “I've always
been a fan of horror movies, and Women
Beware Women is a lot like one. From the
start of both, you know people are going to
die, but you keep watching because you want
to know how. This play's all about getting to

that last scene. I don't want to give anything
away, but it's incredibly intense and
thrilling.”

In addition to the complicated characters,
staging the play definitely presented some
challenges. “We had to incorporate a sword-
fight and make the language sound realistic
and natural. Also, when we were deciding
how to stage the script's sexual innuendos,
we had to keep in mind that the show will be
playing during Parents' Weekend, so we
made these moments more suggestive rather
than concrete.”

Sutch is enthusiastic about this year's cast,
conveying that the cast has made directing
the production an amazing, memorable
experience for him.

“The actors are an incredibly talented and
creative group of people. They launched
themselves into their roles with abandon,
and they always came to rehearsals with end-
less amounts of ideas and energy.”

And though the play is dark and cynical,
the rehearsal process has not been. “We've
all had a lot of fun working together,” Sutch
said.

“For example, once we were rehearsing a
scene where one character has to leap out of
hiding and murder another character, but it
just wasn't working, so I told the actor to
give a big, violent yell the next time he
jumped out. It wound up being hilarious
because we were all expecting some sort of
guttural scream, but instead he shouted
‘Blamey!' And now that's our rallying cry.”
