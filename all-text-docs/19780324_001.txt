Brown,Jackson discuss future plans

By KIRBY OWEN
Staff Writer

Bruce Brown was elected
President of the SGA by garne-
ring 464 votes, of a total of 847
cast, to the 383 of his opponent,
Lynn Langley. John Jackson,
by receiving 434 votes to Bill
Peeples’ 159 and John Stiefel’s
196, captured the Vice-Presi-
dent’s post.

On the night of their victory,
they discussed areas in which
they want to work:and some of
their ideas that they hope to
incorporate.

President Bruce Brown said
they hope to begin the ‘‘substi-
tute things.”’ First on this list
will be course. evaluation. ‘‘It’s

going well now but we need to
make it more statistically accu-
rate,”’said Brown. This would
involve a higher percentage of
student response to question-
naires. It will lead to more
honesty and accuracy ‘concer.
ning the courses but we will
need the cooperation of the
faculty and administration, he
emphasized.

Vice-President John Jackson
added that they want to make
the course evaluations “‘a little
more relevant for freshmen;”’ to

’ make available to them, ‘‘the.

sort of thing that upperclass-
men hear through the grape-
vine.”’ He continued that they
hoped ‘‘to give freshmen who

‘Course crunch’
needs monitoring

Some of the subtler causes
‘and consequences of the course
crunch became evident as add-
drop was completed and admin-
istrators developed a perspec-
tive on the problem.

According to the Registrar,
Richard Burts, Jr., ‘“‘We still
have some technical problems;
some errors in the add-drop
procedure. As soon as we
correct these technical errors, I
think everyone who wanted
three courses will have them.”’

However, Academic Vice
President and Dean of Faculty
T.C. Price Zimmermann admit-
ted, ‘‘We need to make adjust-
ments here and there and we
will continue to monitor the
situation very closely.’’ Dean of
Students Wili ‘verry agreed,
“We're really going to have to
investigate. I think it is parti-
cularly unfortunate after the
long winter of our discontent--
after the long, cold, winter of
our discontent.”’

Terry said, ‘“‘I have a real
problem with students forced
into courses in which they have
no interest, just to have three
courses. I’m not saying a
student should only take what
he knows he’s interested in, but
that really does upset me,
upsets students, upsets par-
ents. In the past, I’ve had calls
from parents. They’re paying
too much to have their sons and
daughters be taking courses
they have no interest in.”’

But Zimmermann felt the
problem ‘“‘looks worse than. it
is.”’ Burts noted that out of the
420 students who did not have
three courses at the beginning
of add-drop, close to 70 stu-
dents did not want three
courses.

Zimmermann added, “I think
this is an unusual event. I
doubt very much that it will
recur to this degree.‘‘ |

Terry felt that ‘‘The factors
all merged at this particular
time. Professors, students, and

the Registrar’s office have done
the best they could, given the
conditions of this term.‘‘ Terry
said he thought Burts has been
particularly understanding and
open concerning the problem
this term.

Zimmermann commented on
some of the causes of the
problem. Concerning the seme-
ster abroad program, which
took three professors and only
ten students per professor off
campus at once, Zimmermann
said, ‘‘We are trying to arrange
one of the travelling semesters
in the fall. It doesn’t contribute
much to the problem to have the
professors gone. Those ten stu-
dents aren’t enrolling in other
courses.’”’ Thus, the professors
are actually teaching the equi-
valent of thirty students.

As for the added strain that
leave of absences and sabbati-
cals place on professors remain-
ing at Davidson, Zimmermann

explained, ‘“‘Leave of absences
ait p-4titiaily [Cpiawu ucocause

we’re not paying a salary.
Sabbaticals, of course, are dif-
ferent.’’

He added, ‘‘Kaylor (Professor
of Religion David R. Kaylor) is
a net loss. Dr. Clark (Professor
of Religion Thomas Clark) is
teaching three terms, when he
usually teaches only two, and

haven’t been here yet the ad-
vantages that the upperclass-
men have. He emphasized that
“course evaluation is vital be-
cause the courses you choose
largely determine the quality of
your education.”

Brown also expressed hope
that students could become
involved with faculty evalua-
tions. He added that faculty
evaluations need student input

as tenure. He continued by
saying that Vice-President for
Academic Affairs T.C. Zim-
mermann is now working on a

faculty evaluation procedure —

that ‘‘hopefully through the
Senate, students will have input
into it.”

Both Brown and Jackson
agree that the registration pro-
cedure needs some re-evalua-

tion, to assure that a greater
percentage of students get the
courses they want. Brown em-
phasized that this would in-
volve more interdepartmental
cooperation by providing more
choice of courses or by raising
the ceilings on those available.

Brown advocated an early
registration, perhaps eight
weeks into the term, which
would include going through
drop-add before the term is
over. Jackson said, ‘It would
be nice to have the kinks out
before the freshmen arrive.”

Brown feels that the Admis-
sions Committee would benefit
by having a student member on
it. A junior or senior who’s a
responsible student will provide
good input, said Brown. Jack-
son added, ‘‘Students also have
a clearer idea of the high school
situation:”

Brown also emphasized the
need for re-organization of the
Advisory Councils. He added
that in the past, ‘‘they haven’t
been meeting often enough and
they haven’t been dealing suffi-
ciently with the needed issues.”

Jackson added that the Fin-
ance, Personnel, and Develop-
ment Council should be divided
up because now there is too

Roommates win ‘Watson’

By CAROL LOPTSON
Staff Writer

John O’Neal Craig, III, ’78,
and Jeffrey Cone Metzel, '78, of
Davidson College have each
been awarded a Thomas J.
Watson Fellowship.

Craig.said, ‘‘I think it is
the first time at Davidson that
roommates won the Watson.”’

“The Watson’’ provides
$7000 ($9500 if you are married
and will be accompanied by
your spouse or children. during
your fellowship year) to cover
the expenses of travel, research,
clerical help, and equipment
related to the independent stu-
dy project proposed by the
recipient of the award.

It was started in 1968 to
enable outstanding college gra-

duates to take a year of inde-
pendent study and travel a-
broad to pursue a special topic
or an ongoing interest.

Graduating seniors can apply
no matter what their career
plans are. ‘‘The Watson’’ is
open to nominations from about
fifty small liberal arts private
colleges and universities.

To apply, students submit
their proposals to Dean of
Students Will Terry by October
15. The Faculty Committee on
Graduate Fellowships and three
students interview candidates
and select four students to
compete nationally.

Craig’s proposal is entitled,
“Racial Tensions in Western
Europe’ and he plans to visit
Great Britain, France, Sweden,

Four Davidson students
have founded an organization
called Project Peace whose
goal is to exercise a ‘“‘harmon-
izing influence in various con-
flict-ridden areas throughout
the world.”’

Sophemores George Cornel-
son and Mark Hooper, senior
Chuck Fiden, and Int®rna-
tional Studen Yousseff, Abagui
intend for Project Peace ‘‘to
| promote student awareness as

Project Peace commences

well as take practical action to
aid conflict victims,’’ said
Abagui.

Currently Project Peace is
conducting a campaign to
raise money and provide cloth-
ing to a Lebanese family
displaced by recent Israeli-
PLO fighting in Southern
Lebanon. Forty dollars were
collected Wednesday, the first
day of fund-raising.

Cornelson said the purpose
of this campaign is to let the
Lebangse ~know that there are

people in the West who act-
ually care what’s going on
over there.”’

In the future, Project Peace
plans to organize public-
awarenbss discussions and de-
bates, making use of films and
perhaps bringing in outside
speakers.

The students hope that
word of Project Peace will
spread into the Davidson com-
munity, Charlotte, and other
college and university cam-

uses.

and the Netherlands. Craig is a
History major, interested in
American and British history.
Metzel’s proposal is ‘‘Interna-
(nal Transportation Systems
Within Africa’. He will study
in England, France, Tanzania,
Kenya, Zambia, Algeria, Mali,
and Niger. Metzel is a Special
Center major in his homemade

“major, International Develop-

ment.

Craig said, ‘‘I plan to go to
law ‘school. I was looking for
something as a break between
Davidson and law school. I've
always been interested in race
relations.

Craig pointed out, ‘‘More and
more, race relations in England
are becoming a political football
between the Labor Party and

the Conservatives.”
Craig plans to concentrate on

the West Indian immigrants in
England. the Arabs in France,
the Moluccans in the Nefher-
lands, and Lebanese and Cyp-
rian refugees in Sweden. Craig
will interview government au-
thorities and prominent intel-
lectuals connected with the
situation, as well as the ‘man
on the street.’’ He hopes to get
a perspective on the American
problem.

“Mine has nothing to do with
future plans.’’ commented
Craig. ‘‘Buck’s might lead dir-
ectly to a Ph. D dissertation.”

Craig said, ‘‘We’re thinking
of doing a series of articles for
some newspaper.”’
