10:30 pm in Love Auditorium, is one
of those rare movies which manages
to.catch both.psychological depth and
dramatic interest at the same time.

Dog Day Afternoon”’ had it. ‘‘The
Godfather’’ had it. And ‘‘Taxi Dri-
ver’ has it too— some quality that
keeps the viewer riveted to the screen

_ and immersed in the plot. .

After saying this, ‘‘Taxi Driver’’ is
certainly nc‘ a movie for everybody
and some may find it offensive.
Dealing with a New York City cab
driver who goes whacko and commits
a series of murders, this film is

. definitely not for the squeamish.
But: the gore used here seems to be
used intelligently and can be included

in the area of artistic.expression.

Robert DeNiro stars in ‘Taxi
Driver’’ as Travis Bickle, a man who
is slowly coming apart as the movie
opens. He goés to porn movies. He

- pops pills..He is filled with a deep
hatred for the city about him.

a. Martin Scorsese's ‘'Taxi Driver", _
to be shown tomorrow. night at 8 and

Bickle becomes a cabbie because he
‘just wants to work late hours.’’ He
spends much of the movie just riding
around some of the worst streets in
the city.

Two unsuccessful love stories en-
mesh themselves in.the plot. One is
with Cybil, Shepherd (who gives the ©
only bad. performance of the picture)
and the other involves Jodie Foster,

~ who plays-a 12-year-old prostitute.

DeNiro has illusions of rescuing the
young girl. In a sense, he does.

For more literary viewers, there are
some ‘‘heavy’’ references in ‘‘Taxi
Driver’’ which will be keeping film
students, writing term: papers for
years to come.

Paul Schrader, who: wrote the
script, claims he wanted to put the
hero of Jean Paul Sartre's Nausea on
the screen. So.don’t expect a light
adventure story. You won’t find it.

Other behind-the-camera credit
goes to the director Martin Scorsese

and ‘‘New York, New York’’) and the

On Saturday, September
17, Davidson’s cross country
team defeated Georgia State
in a dual meet scored from the
results of the Stone Mountain
Road Race in Georgia.

This five mile event an-
nually attracts over 400 run-
ners from: throughout the
southeastern United States.

The victory evened the
Wildcat runner’s record at 1-1
after an opening defeat to
powerful Duke the week be-
fore.

Coach Norman Koller con-
sidered the 25-32 victory an
especially ‘‘pleasant kind of a
win’’ because two of his top
runners did not figure in the
scoring. Junior Doug Horn
dropped from the race because
of a foot injury and John
Davis, winner of the freshman
cake race, did not make the
trip.

Senior Coty Pinckney, who
was teaching in Africa last
year and did not run for the
Cats in 1976, finished first in

the dual meet and 35th overall .

with a time of 25:58.
Sophomore George Strobel
finished second for the Wild-
cats and third in'the dual meet
with a time of 26:52. Bart
Landess, a freshman, placed
third for Davidson at 27:40:
Vasili Carperos ran 28:04,
over two! minutes better than
his time in last year’s race,
and was fourth for the Cats.
Jeff Morrow, another sopho-
more, ran fifth with a time of
28:24. i
Cross country scoring i8

based on the top five finishers

for both teams. The five places.

are added together and the
sum is the score for the team.

Thus, freshman Greg -Bar-
nard and sophomore Tom
Scott, who finished 10th and
llth respectively, figured in
the scoring by “*‘pushing”’ the
fifth place Ga. State runner to
12th in the meet and widening

Davidson's victory margin.

Koller has high hopes for
this year’s team and predicts
improvement over last year's
squad, which finished with a
losing record. i

Pinckney stated, ‘This
could be Davidson’s best cross
country team ever.”’

Koller considers runners
Barnard, Davis, and -<Landess

Cat runners beat Ga. State ~

“as pood freshmen ae: David:
son has ever had.”’

Koller went on to say,

‘John Davis could be the best

runner in the history of the 4

school.”’

_. The fact that six of the first

seven finishers for the Wild-
cats in Saturday's race were
either a freshman or a sopho-
more indicates the strength of
this year’s runners and great
potential for years to come.

Koller also ran in the race, .
finishing one second behind
Senior Bill Gaynor.

Davidson's runners are idle |

next week and the prognosis is
good for the tri-meet with
Lynchburg and Campbell Col-
lege at Lynchburg on October
