AMENDMENT

{Continued From Page 1)

On Monday he explained that
the original amendment was
proposed because “it was gen-
erally felt that our proposed
student body change must. ac-
tually take’or at least closely
approach the same form and
terminology as that used in the
faculty change. in order that
ours meet the requirement of
‘being in accordance with’ that
faculty change.”

After the amendment was put
forward. said Jackson. ‘‘the
weaknesses and ambiguities of
it were discussed.” As a result
of this, the ‘‘new definition of
campus” amendment was pro-
posed. because it would not
leave ‘the areas of vagueness
and definite threat to the-stu-
dent body’ of the first one. ‘It
was also felt that the new pro-
posal was still in keeping with
the faculty's stipulation of ‘be-
ing in accordance with’ its
changed rule.’ Jackson stated.

On Tuesday, Jackson elabo-
rated on his reasons for feeling
the first proposal to be inade-
quate and the new one to be
“much more reasonable and
certain.”

The original proposal, ‘he said.
doesn't attempt to make alco-
hol in trunks legal” and it thus
“places the student: body in a
‘never-never Jand’*' where they
can’t be sure what is or what
is not legal.

POSSESSION ONLY

Jackson then noted that under
the new proposal “it would not
be illegal to keep alcohol in
trunks.” and that there would be
“no threat to you" or danger
of a violation if the liquor were
properly stored. He emphasized,
however, that the new rule “is
in regard only to possession”
in trunks. and that actually
drinking in a trunk would stil!
be illegal.

The rejection of the original- 9 proposed an amendment to

ly proposed amendment in order
that the new, more clearly
worded amendment might be
adopted came as the culmina-
tion of a week of intense discus-
sion and changing of the cam-
pur drinking rules. as. well as
several months of work and gen-
eral discussion prior to that
time.

As a result of that prolonged
discussion. the faculty ‘on Dec.
8 modified its regulation on the
search of automobiles so that
it stated in part that “trunks of
vehicles on campus will not be
searched nor jurisdiction claim-
ed without prior authorization
for the search of a speciied ve-
hicle by the Honor Court. the
Student Council, or the Execu-
tive Committee of the Faculty.”

The Student Council on Dec.

LAKESIDE I

the Student Body Constitution
which closely co-incided with
the wording of the new faculty
rule. It was this amendment
which was rejected by the stu-
dent body today because of the
weaknesses and loopholes in its
phrasing. °

“Our defense was good tonght; it was the kind we.
' ought to play,” beamed Coach Lefty Driesell after the

Wildcats’

91-69 smashing of VMI Tuesday. “I was

really happy with the way our boys handled Charlie
Schmaus and Joe Kruszewski, VMI’s top two threats.”

Davidson an 11-point spread as

Kruszewski and Snyder had

vidson team had hit slightly
more than half of their field goal

had connected on not quite one
third of theirs.

Davidson controlled the sec-

not playing a tight game, picked

Briggs with 0:10 showing on
the clock gave Davidson its fi-
nal spread of 91-69. ,

Pointed out Driesell after the
game. “Briggs was ooking
good tonight, too; he's just like
a starter now and might even
start in Marcon’s place against
Ohio State. Not that Marcon’s
not doing a good job—he’s do-
ing fine — but those extra two
inches (Briggs is 6-5, Marcon
is 6-3) will let him help a lot
more against a tall man.”

Hetzel was the game's leader
as he collected 26 points and 17
rebounds, but Snyder was not
far behind with his 23 points and
9 rebounds. Davidson and
Teague each hit 11 points and
Marcon scored 9. For the vis-
ftors, Kruzsewski collected 18.
points. Schmaus, 15, and Por-
fer. 14.

Jacksonville Falls

Last Saturday evening guard
Charlie Marcon poured in. 15
last-half points to break a nip-
and-tuck game with Jacksonville
wide open. Jacksonville was out
to upset the ‘Cats and they
started off well, scrapping for
the lead all through .the. first
half. °

During that time the Florida
fhosts out-rebounded Davidson
24-23, and only a last-minute
shot by Fred Hetzel gave. Da-
vidson a 38-37 halftime lead.

The first six minutes of the
second period looked like a re-
play of the first half as the lead
again shifted several times be-
fore a hook by Jacksonville's
Ralph Tiner tied the slate. at 47-
47 with 14:00 to go. The Wild-
cats then began to live up to
their name as they leaped out
to a 75-62 edge at the 5:00 mark.
From then on the game was all

perate. to catch up. lost unity
and form. Davidson's final mark
was 91 70.

Marcon and Snyder Ied the
‘Cats’ return from mediocrity as
together they accounted for 37
of Davidson’s 53 last-half tal-
lies. Marcon also pulled down
9 rebounds in sparking the win.
Final totals credited Snyder
with 31 points, Marcon and
Hetzel with 18 each. Teague
