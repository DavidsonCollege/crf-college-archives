The DAVIDSONIAN February 13, 1918

In spite of most disagreeable weather
the work room had an attendance of 112
in the five working afternoons since our
last report. Mrs. Archie Brown, Miss
Madge Potts, Mrs. Joc Glasgow and
Miss Archie Sloan have the honors this
week for unbroken attendance.

The ladies have all proved wonder-

fully expert in cutting and folding the
compresses which were allotted us by
the Charlotte chapter for this week's
work. Five hundred are finished and
ready for shipment. In addition te this,
two bolts of outing have been made into
scultetis bandages, and the paper-back
pads were made continuously by some
workers. We have every reason to be
much gratified by the diligence of the
workers and the excellence of the work
turned out. We should be proud to
show the work.to visitors. The junior
members help most faithfully and accept-
ably. The four-year-old Mildred Fort-
ner, in full Red Cross costume, is on
hand every day and acts as page between
workers.
. Miss Archie Sloan is wonderfully
helpful in her untiring cutting and pre-
paring of the papers for the pads being
made. On Friday afternoon Mrs, Mar-
tin and Miss Frances Worth both being
absent, Mrs. A. Brown and Miss Madge
Potts very capably conducted affairs in
the work room.

One sweater and a few comfort bags
have been contributed this week. Much
of the knitted work has been turned in.
To Miss Gordon Baskerville is due
thanks for making our splendid Red
Cross banner. (There has heen no rush
of volunteers to make a place to hang
coats). We have the lumber.

are saving now not alone for _ selfish
reasons, we are saving now from patriot-
ism, saving not alone for ourselves but
for our country. The combination of pa-
triotism and thrift is. indeed. going to
make the War Savings campaign an
epoch in our national life. It is not only
going to be a thing of tremendous bene-
fit to millions of citizens, it is going to
be a thing of tremendous advantage to
the nation as a whole. and affect our
whole national life. It marks the be-
ginning of a new era in American life,
an era of economy, good sense. and pa-
triotism.

HAS NEW PRINCIPALIC A

Rev. W. A. Jenkins, pastor of the lo-
cal Methodist church, has accepted and
entered upon his duties as principal of
the local high school. The former
principal, Mr. R. H. Walker, who has
been drafted, left during the latter part
of last week for Shipman, Va. During
the time that he has been connected with
it the school has prospered and his many
friends ‘in Davidson will be sorry to
have Mr. Walker leave.

The new principal is a graduate of
the University of North Carolina and
later of the Yale Divinity School. He
has been active in the ministry for sev-
eral years. These qualifications, togeth-
er with his popularity locally, predicts a
most successful season from now until
the closing of the school for the summer
holidays.

WAR SAVINGS.

“War Savings Stamps mark an epnch
in our national life.”—Secretary of the
Treasury McAdoo.

Many a successful business man has
said that the saving of his first dollar
was the most important single act of his
life: that it marked the beginning of a
habit and a course of conduct to which
he attributed his success.

Something very analogous to this, it is
believed. is going to be the effect on the
American Nation of the War Savings
camnaigen. Not onlv are millions of in-
dividual citizens poing to begin to save.
but this habit of economy and saving is
going to he a collective movement, a
movement not of. individuals alone but
of the nation.

The habit of saving formed now has
a deeper incentive than ordinary. We

The Ring-tum Phi—The long antici-
nated festivities of the mid-term were
recently inauguarated at Washington &
Lee University. The Junior Prom was
held immediately after the basketball
game with William and Marv. The
fancy dress ball was staged the following
night. There was a curtailment of un-
necessary expense as a measure of war
economy, but the occasion was a great
success as the essentials, “the girls and
the music,” were up to the usual stand-
