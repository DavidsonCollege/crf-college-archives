THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 23, 1930

Earth Just Missed
By Speeding Comet

Meteor Discovered by French
Astronomer Passing Earth

Paris—(IP)—When you miss the fender
of your neighbor’s car by a few inches you
think nothing of it, but when a comet comes
within five million miles of the earth—head-
ed straight for us—that’s something to-talk
about.

French astronomers have just revealed how
close a call the earth had this summer from

being struck amidships by Schwassmann- |
Wachmann, a rather small but speedy comet |
which whizzed into our planetary system |
along last May, and made a_bee-line for |

man’s favorite star.

The scientists insist that the earth had a

narrower escape than the average layman |
would like to believe. Had the little comet |

come on at the speed and angle it did when
it was discovered by German astronomers
last May, it would have put quite a dent in
our globe, and might even have knocked us
galley west.

Some scientists are arguing over just
what would have happened if the visitor had
landed here. Some say it would have put
a huge dent in us like a derby hat struck
by an icy snowball. Others think it might
have caused a jar sufficient to break the earth
into small pieces, sending Chicago off to-
ward Mars, and New York in the direction
of Planet X.

The Frenchmen point out that in the past
few centuries only three comets have come
dangerously close to the earth. Lexell’s comet
came nearest, missing the world by only
1,440,000 miles on July 1, 1770, while Pons-
Winnecke passed by just 3,480,000 miles on
June 27, 1927. .

As a matter of fact, the latest comet vis
itor is no larger than some meteors which
have actually landed on this earth. It is but
440 yards in diameter, the large. appearance
being due to surrounding gases.

The meteors of that size which have struck

the earth have done little damage because |
they arrived at much less speed, and usually |

landed in desolate spots.

The 1930 visitor was traveling so. fast
that it could be seen to move with the naked
eye.

’CATS TROUNCE BULLDOGS

ning plays. Wilson, Citadel, threw nineteen
passes, three of which settled into friendly
arms for a total gain of 36 yards. However,

five of his heaves were intercepted by the |

alert Davidson defense. The Wildcats them-
selves tried twelve passes, also completing
only three, but gaining 53 yards. They had
two intercepted by the enemy. The two
teams made the same number of first downs,
each registering nine. Davidson was_pen-
alized in all 30 yards, while Citadel was set
back 25.

Citadel presented one of the hardest
charging teams so far encountered by the
Wildcats, and among them, Holland and

Oglesby, Citadel guard and tackle, seemed
* to be even keener than. the rest, for they
spilled many a Davidson play before it got
started. Citadel’s touted ends lived up to all
predictions.

For the Wildcats, Buddy Gardner, star |

Sophomore center, was in every play, often

spilling Citadel’s plays far behind the line

of scrimmage. Brock and Brown were tow-

ers of stréngth in the line. The whole back-

field drove with mighty power, but the hard-

running McCall was easily the shining light.

COMPETITION OF CLASSES

(Continued from page 1)

Therefore, if the Seniors defeat the Juniors
it would give them a tie for first place,
while a victory for the Juniors would give
them the championship.

After the football championship is decid-
ed, a program of inter-class basketball under
the direction of Heath Whittle will start.

Scheduled for Team

Five Men to be Chosen for
Davidson’s Squad

The team of Davidson is
rapidly rounding into form, but they have
not as yet arranged a schedule. So far they
have only arranged one meet and that is a
meet with the cross-country team of the
| University of South Carolina between the
j|halves of the Davidson-University of North
Carolina football game on November 15.
| This will be a three-mile race which will be
|run over the golf course and will end in
|front of the stadium. The coaches are also
|dickering for a meet with Duke University
| for sometime this. fall.

cross-country

There will be five men on this year’s
|team. They are to be chosen from the fol-
|lowing men: Brannon, Tom Neal, John
Howard, Alex Earle, Murphy, George
O'Hanlon, Ben Drake, and Rachel. The
outstanding men of this group are Brannon,
Neal, Earle, Murphy and Drake. Brannon,
who won his letter last year, is one of the
best two-milers in North Carolina. Neal, a
letterman from the 1929 and 1930 squad, is
very fast on the half-mile, which is his spe-
cialty. Earle, a Sophomore,. is one of the
fastest milers in Davidson. Last year he came
within a second of the present college rec-
ord. Murphy, a member of the Senior class,
showed vast improvement toward the last
|of last year, and although he did not get a
| letter, he was regarded by the coach as a
|likely prospect. Drake, who is also a Senior,
could not come out for track last year on
account of an operation, but he is showing
up very well this year and will no doubt
develop into a very, good man.

Beat of Tom-Toms
Accompanies Game

Lawrence, Kans.—(IP)—The beat of
tom-toms and chanting of braves echoed over
the campus of Haskell Institute here as
more than 1,000 Indians, attending a na-
tion-wide pow-wow incident to the game be-
tween Haskell and the University of Kansas,
participated in the war dances of their fore-
fathers.

The spectacle was held in the athletic sta-
dium of the government’s Indian school. The
braves tramped across the chalk lines of the
institution’s football field, the modern battle-
ground of Indian youths.

Following the dances, the Indians partici-
pated in a colorful pageant depicting the his-
tory of a number of Indian tribes.

The next night, a band of present-day
Indian warriors, Haskell’s football team,
went on the warpath against the University
of Kansas eleven, and lost by a score of 33
to 7.

It was the first meeting of the two teams
in ten years. The pow-wow, called in cele-
bration of the resumption of athletic rela-
tions between the two schools, was intended
at first only for graduates and students of
Haskell. It was made nation-wide, however,
when Indians from all parts of the country
announced they would attend.

Meeting at Sandusky, Ohio, recently, the
Ohio division of the United Daughters of
the Confederacy decided to place a marker
at the Mount Vernon, Ohio, birthplace of
Dan Emmett, author of the Southern “an-
them,” Dixie.

the squad; so a great deal of credit is due
a team that can acquire as enviable a rec-
ord as did these Wildcats with the mate-
rial that was available. The team piled up
a total of 213 points to a total of 36 for
their opponents. They were outweighed about
forty pounds to the man in nearly every
game that they played. The team has the
credit of being the first in the South to
utilize the forward pass as a regular of-
fensive weapon on the first down anywhere
in the field outside its own 25-yard line,
one of the first teams to: use the hidden
ball system, and above all they defeated a
strong Tar Heel team that was doped to
beat them by several touchdowns.

Those teams that felt the Wildcats’ claws
in that year were Catawba, Lenoir, Caro-
lina, The Citadel, South Carolina, and Wake
Forest. They were defeated by V. Pel.
and Washington and Lee.

DeWitt Kluttz, now a physician of Wash-
ington, captained the team in this historic
year of Davidson football.

MR. HARRY RIMMER SPEAKS

(Continued from page 1)
of this kind would tend toward causing such
a changeable nature as that of Pharoah
clearly brought out in Exodus,” said Mr.
Rimmer.

“Science finds that there are fourteen ele-
ments in the earth. It also discovers that
there are these fourteen elements in the body
of man. Thus research is reinforcing the
words of Moses dealing with his account
of creation. The test tube of science is throw-
ing light on religious truth.”

In conclusion, Mr. Rimmer urged all to
study the Bible and make its Savior their
personal friend.

Friends of peace in the United States must
begin by breaking up this civil war of bandits.

ages to the college that nurtured them, and
which they now cherish.

Feeling that Davidson alumni would be in-
terested in what faculty members had to say
to them, it was decided this year to confine
the speakers to local selections, and to choose
men that represented different eras. With
this end in view, Dr. C. R. Harding, Dr.
C. M. Richards, and Capt. Norton G. Pritch-
ett were invited to make ten-minute ad-
dresses and have accepted. Dr. Harding will
speak on “Alumni Loyalty”; Dr. Richards on
“College Traditions,” and Captain Pritchett
along the line of athletics, past, present, and
future. These three men will speak at the
aerciitd to 18 held in the auditorium of
Chambers Building. The program will prob-
ably be preceded by an organ recital, giving
the earlier arrivals, and others who-have not
had the opportunity, a chance to hear the
beautiful strains of the organ. Dr. Walter
Lingle, president of the college, will greet
the visitors in a cordial welcome, and a pause
will be made in the hour’s exercises to honor
those alumni who have passed away since
last Home-Coming Day. Upon this, the con-
clusion of this program, the alumni and
friends will adjourn to the batquet hall be-
low for the alumni luncheon,
