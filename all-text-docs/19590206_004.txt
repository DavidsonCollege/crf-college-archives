Curriculum Changes
In Mathematics, Physics

A renovation in the Mathematics and Physics Departments will get underway
next year. In a modernization of courses and methods of teaching for which the de-

partments have been gradually preparing in recent years,

the new curriculum will

abolish certain courses and introduce several new ones.

PHYSICS CHANGES

The Physics Department,
augmented by a new professor
and by the return of Dr. Piet-
enpol to classroom instruction,
will make several major re-
visions. Beginning next year,
there will be two courses in
general physics: 21-22, for pre-
medical students and for ma-
jors in the humanities and the
social sciences, and 23-24, for
physics majors and engineering
students.

Other alterations will take
place in the organization of ad-
vanced courses, and an honors
course will be offered for high-
ly qualified physics majors.
A one-semester survey of Mo-
dern Physics, requiring the
general physics course but no
advanced mathematics, — will
enable liberal arts students to

Golden To Lecture
In Union Tuesday

Harry Golden, the Charlotte
author whose Only in America
reached the top of America's
best-seller lists a few months
ago, will appear at Davidson
next week, Announcement of
Golden’s coming visit was made
recently by Lamar Riggs. chair-
man of the Union Roundtable
Committee.

Golden, noted ‘as a lecturer.
will sneak at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, '
February 10, in the College
Union ballroom. His topic will

'

understand contemporary de-
velopments in the subject.

In the Mathematics Depart-
ment, the present courses in
Math 10 (a non-credit intro-
duction to basic algebra), Math
11 (college algebra), and Math
12 (trigonometry) will all be
dropped. The present course in
Math 11S, an introduction to
the foundations and principles
of mathematics, will become
Math 11. Math 13, a survey of
algebra and trig, will be
changed to second semester as
Math 14, and the present course

in analytie geometry, Math 21,
will be eliminated altogether in
favor of Math 16, a unified in-
troduction to analytic geometry
and the calculus.

Under this new plan, all
freshmen would take Math 11
first semester. Those who did
not plan to take any more
mathematics would enter Math
12, a “liberal arts” type of
course similar to Math 11. Stu-
dents with high school trig-
onometry and a grade of B on
Math 11 would take Math 16,
while ail others who intended
to continue in Math would first
take Math 14.

He also said, “This clearly

Head football coach Bill Dole
declined to enter the contro-
versy and issued the following
statement. “As football coach

the policies set forth by the

Athletic Director Dr. Tom

is lenient in the percent they
give to athletics, considering
the amount of money they
take in. Everyone would like
to have more, but we must
be realistic about the situe-
tion and stick to good busi-
ness practices.

“The general fund is increas-
ing every year, so the amount
given to athletics is also on
the rise. The solution is simply
to raise more money for the
alumni fund.”

Friday Comments On
Educational Problems

By CHARLES CHASTAIN
Davidsonian Associate Rditer

Following his recent chapel speech, President Wil-
liam Friday of the consolidated University of North Caro-

lina answered the questions of a DAVIDSONIAN staff

member in a brief interview.

President Friday, who is a
member of the Davidson Board
of Visitors, commented on the
problems confronting higher
education in the South, espe-
cially with reference to David-
son and to the University of
North Carolina.

Wheat would you say sre
the main problems which Da
vidson will have fo face in
the near future?

All colleges are faced with
problems of enrollment, facul-
ty, and finances, and the solu-
tions to these are more or less
decisions that have got to be
made by the individual insti-
tutions. As far as Davidson
goes, 1 know of no other four-
year liberal arts school that en-
joys the reputation that Da-
vidson has. Its quality of work
is widely recognized.

What would you have to
say about the future of
Southern education?

There is the problem we are
all facing together—there are
thousands of children being
born, and many will want and

need a college education. I be-
lieve that in North Carolina
we've got to have a healthy
balance between state and pri-
vate colleges.

What are the state-support-
ed colleges of North Carolina
doing to maintain and raise

The University has instituted
uniform admissions tests, on
which a minimum score must
be met. But the test itself is
not the sole criterion for judg-
ing applicants. They help a stu-
dent find himself and help us
evaluate where he can start in
math, English, ete.

Would you care to conr
ment on the recent contro-
versy concerning your deci-
sion to eliminate the non-
Communist oath for Univer-
sity of North Caroline facul-
ty members?

The administration dropped
the questions about prior Com-
munist affiliation from the per-
sonnel form because we felt
that the record showed this pro-
cedure to be inefficient. In
making this decision, the adi
ministration reaffirmed its de-*
cision that the oath to the Unit-
ed States and to the State of
North Carolina should be main-
tained.

What is the University do
ing to initiste honors pro
grams end individual ad-
vanced work for undergrad-
vates, as many smaller col-,
leges have already done?

‘The Carnegie Corporation
gave us a grant of one hun-
dred thousand dollars to de-
velop a five-year experimental
program at Chapel Hill. We've
