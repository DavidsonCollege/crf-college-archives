Computers jumble schedules

Registration starts over after Registrar's Office discovered system errors

By Mary Laura Moretz
Staff Writer

When pre-med senior Emily
Davis filled out her schedule tree
to register for spring classes, she
wrote down a lot of the courses she
needed to finish out her history
major, including two seminars.

A week later, when she picked
up her completed schedule, she
was surprised to see nothing on her
schedule except ... horseback

riding?!?

“T just laughed,” says Davis of
the schedule mix-up. She was one
of hundreds of students with simi-
larly raised eyebrows last week
after the computerized registration
system went down, leaving anum-
ber of schedules mixed up, blank,
or full of randomly selected classes.

The Banner software used by
many of Davidson’s administra-
tive offices has been through four
successful registrations since the

Registrar’s Office began using it.
The problem last week occurred
when the system went down and
automatically restarted. During
the restarting, data for many sched-
ules got lost or confused.

Registrar Polly Griffin says
the problem went unnoticed at first.
The staff saw that “about 1,400
students got schedules with three
or four classes and thought it must
have been successful.”

Cosmic Coffee to
land soon in Davidson

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Assistant News Editor

The long-awaited Cosmic
Coffee House is set to land on
Main Street within a couple of
weeks, according to owner Nancy
Gray.

Gray, who purchased the
space for the coffee house with her
husband Edward, anticipates the
store will open in 10 to 15 days.
Delayed construction has made
both townspeople and students
anxious for the shop’s opening ac-
cording to Gray.

The Grays are experienced in

operating a coffee shop, as they
already own a Cosmic Coffee
House in Blowing Rock. They

. plan to model Davidson’s coffee

house on their original, where they
even roast their own 27 varieties of
coffee.

According to Gray, their Cos-
mic Coffee has been so successful
in the mountains that they sell it to
five different fine-dining establish-
ments.

Gray anticipates that their new
European-style coffee shop will
“be a gathering place” which will
enhance “Davidson’s already
unique environment.” She plans to

sell homemade muffins, bagels,
danishes and sandwiches from 8-
100n weekdays and 8-12 on week-
ends.

' At Cosmic Coffee in Blowing
Rock, the Grays host live enter-
tainment on weekends, and orga-
nize monthly art shows featuring
local artists. They hope to institute
both at Davidson’s Cosmic Coffee
House. In the past, they have hired
bands heard on WNCW, a public
Radio Station in the North Caro-
lina mountains. Performers at their
coffee house have included Doubt-
ing Thomas and the Layman’s
Daughter.

days, when students flocked to the
Registrar’ s Office to ask questions,
that Griffin realized what had hap-
pened. At first, she thought the
problem might have stemmed from
studenterror in filling out the forms,
but then “we started seeing sheets
we could not explain.”

“They were very helpful,” says
Davis of the staff’ s response to the
large number of problems. Junior
Clair Freeman, who heads the
Council on Academic Affairs, in-

President Kuykendall addresses the students,

formed the SGA last week that
Griffin and her staff “have been
very sympathetic towards seniors
who need classes to graduate” and
everyone else who has had a sched-
uling problem.

Within just a few days, Grif-
fin and the staff decided to re-run
the batch processes for selecting
schedules, leaving all previous
schedules invalid. The new com-
pleted schedules should be avail-

able sometime this week.

graduation. Kurt Holmes sug-
gested the presence of alcohol in
post-graduation activities only in-
creased the risk of damage to col-
lege housing and property.

With negotiations of the sub-
committee complete, Hamlin pro-
nounced that RLO “will proceed
with a plan to allow seniors the
option of staying over Sunday
night.” In addition to Sunday’s
standard checkout (2-5 p.m.), the
new policy allows seniors a Mon-
day morning checkout from 9 a.m.
to noon. Accordingly, failure to
check out by the Sunday 5 p.m.

deadline will force seniors to stay
overnight, and check out by 12
p.m. Monday morning. Failure to
check out by noon on Monday will
result'in a $35 late fee.

To combat the possibility of
vandalism, security will be in-
creased, and RLO will not accept
party registrations for Sunday
night. Holmes felt it unnecessary
to allow large scale partying both
Saturday and Sunday night and
therefore denied petitions for Sun-
day night gatherings. Although
the alcohol policy will be waived
Saturday night, RLO expects ad-
herence to the policy Sunday night
and encouraged small parties, con-
tained within apartments, to pre-
vent raucous behavior.

In granting special privileges
to seniors, RLO expects the senior
class to treat the new policy with
respect and responsibility accord-
ing to the Davidson code of honor
and integrity.

Habitat rally unites humanity

By RoBert RAMSAY
Executive Editor

Instead of eating dinner at the
Commons or at Patterson Court
houses last Thursday, the students
of Davidson College, along with
administration and faculty mem-
bers, ate some barbecue in Johnston
Gym.

The Habitat House Commit-
tee organized the rally in order to
laud the efforts of the many people
who worked on the Habitat House
fundraising and awareness-raising

project.

According to sophomore Coo-
per Dean, “the idea was to cancel
dinner at the Commons and Court
houses in order to get as many
students as possible to attend.”

The Habitat House Commit-
tee expected 1200 students to show,
but attendance only reached about
700. However, the event was still
a “successful venture,” says Dean.
“We were pleased with the turn-
out; not just students, but faculty
as well.”

President John Kuykendall

opened the rally with ashortspeech,
followed by a speedy statement
from SGA President Bill Gullan.
Jane Cain, the local director of
Habitat for Humanity, addressed
the bleachers, and told how build-
ing houses for others is addictive.
“T’m hooked,” she said.

After Cain, the owner of a
recently built Habitat house ex-
pressed her gratitude to Cain and
the Habitat program, priming the
crowd for Chaplain Rob Spach’s
