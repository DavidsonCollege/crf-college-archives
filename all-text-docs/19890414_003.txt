College library prepares for computerized catalogue

System will include sophisticated cross-referencing

By MARGARET CARROLL
The Davidson College library
plans to install an automated com-
puterized system in the near future
to help both librarians and library
users locate needed materials. The

library staff is presently looking at
two different companies, Innova-
tive Interfaces Inc. and Data Re-
search Associates, to decide upon
a system for the library.

Acting Assistant Cataloguer

Edward Proctor said that the li-
brary staff will learn about both of
these two companies through day-
long seminars and demonstrations
and then will decide which, if ei-
ther of the two, it wishes to pur-

Referendum reveals 75 percent
agree with condom availability

By SUSANNAH WELFORD
Due to heated controversy sur-
rounding the issue of condom dis-
tribution on campus, the Student
Government Association pre-
sented the student body with a
referendum Tuesday to gauge stu-
dent opinion. Seventy-two percent
of students responding to the sur-
vey favored condom distribution
on campus.
_ Because-of differing convic-
- tions as to the method of distribu-
tion, the SGA _ purposefully
worded the referendum so that stu-
dents: merely decided whether
some method was necessary and
left the more complicated issue of
distribution to be decided ata latter
time.
_The SGA needed “tangible
proof of student opinion to be able

to fairly represent the campus on
the condom issue,” explained
SGA president Tripp Helms. Be-
cause student response was so
overwhelmingly in favor of con-
dom distribution on campus,
Helms said that the SGA will pro-
ceed to bring the issue to the atten-
tion of the Committee on Campus
and Religious Life.

That committee will be directly
responsible for making a recom-
mendation to Dean of Students
Will Terry: and President John
Kuykendall.

The SGA hasalsoestablishedan
ad hoc committee to deal with the
questions that this issue has gener-
ated. Sophomore Rusk senator
Cecily Craighill, a member of the
committee, said, ““The committee
will discuss how to present the

condom issue to the Board of
Trustees and will evaluate alterna-
tives to the idea of condom ma-
chines.”

The SGA Ad Hoc Committee on
the AIDS issue is working in con-
junction with the efforts of the
AIDS Action Committee, but they
are notactively participating in the
battle to bring condom machines

‘to campus.

Junior Caroline Buxton, Warner
Hall senator, stated that the job of
the SGA is to “present to the
administration an accurate picture
of what the student thought on the
vided the means to do this.”

The SGA is silent at this point
about what method of condom
_ distribution it will recommend to
" the administration.

chase. If neither company satisfies |

Davidson’s needs, the staff will
further investigate other auto-
mated computer companies.

The most noticeable change in
the library will be that a row of
terminals will replace the existing
card catalogue. Through use of
these terminals library users will
be able to type in subject, author or
title and find out whether the li-
brary has the book, whether it is
checked out or not and whether
another library has the needed
book. ;

Through one aspect of this com-
puterized system, Boolean search-
ing, one will be able to type in
more specialized topics through
the use of “and, or and not.” For
instance if one is looking for infor-
mation on contemporary politics,
namely between the United States
and the Soviet Union, onecan type
“Reagan and Gorbachev, not Star
Wars” or just “Reagan and Gor-

bachev.” The computer will then
search through the periodicals and
books relating to the specific sub-
ject.

The new system will be used for
acquisitions to order books, cata-
loguing to process books, serials to
check in periodicals, circulation to
lend materials and reference for
“card catalogue.”

Library users will be given a
code for circulation purposes
which will be located on the stu-
dent identification card. At the
circulation desk the librarian will
use a light pen to copy the bor-
rower’s code onto the computer.

The process of installing the
new system could take anywhere
from six months to two years.
However, all of the cards in the
card catalogue have already been
copied into -computerized lan-
guage and will simply need to be
further modified.
