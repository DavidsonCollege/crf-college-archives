gan of our college.

It’s the best thing vet. and I'm with
vou all the way.

Yours for Davidson.

PROFESSORS ENTERTAIN.

Professors Wunder and Gillespie
were the charming “hostesses” of one
of the most enjovable social events of
the entire season on Saturday evening.
Mav 2. The event was one in which
Professors entertained several of their
ladv friends and only four of their gen-
tlemen friends. .

A most delicious salad course was
served, followed bv an ice course, which
was in itself the object of much praisc
as to its deliciousness and the exquisite
manner in which it was served.

The features of the event were the
most excellent plaving of the games by
the ladies and the timidity, vet kind-
nesses of the gentlemen friends who
were at 10:15 p.m. masters of the situ-
ation,

COACH COOK RESIGNS.

Coach Cook has handed in his resig-
nation as athletic director of Davidson
College. As a coach he has ever been
untiring in his efforts in whatever
branch he was directing and has always
put out a team that has been a credit to
Davidson. During his two vears here
he has won the friendship and admira-
tion of all, and we wish him much suc-
cess in his future work. For next vear
he has three or four excellent offers, but
has not vet decided upon which one he
will accept.

Last night he left for New York

"City. where he will spend the remainder

of the week. seeing the Detroit games
while there; then he leaves for Hart-
ford. Conn., for a few weeks. From
there he goes to his summer camp at
Black Hall, Conn., where he will be
for several months. In September he
goes hack to Hartford. where he will
be married.

APRIL MAGAZINE OUT.

+

The April number of the Davidson
College Magazine made its appearance
last Wednesday. In spite of the fact
that its lateness of appearance rather
diminished our. appreciation of it, this
issue is one of the best of the year. It
is not over-thick by any means, but the
contents are unusually well balanced,
with a specially good story. “The Fall
of Dragon,” two essays ‘of divergent
types, and several poems.

The editorial columns seem to be in
doubt as to whether Tite Davipsontan
really has a right to exist or not. The
question about the possibility of support-
ing three periodicals has not been finally
answered as vet, of course. but judging
by the general approbation and support
which Tite Davipsonian has met with
so far, there can be no question as to its
being a good thing. The coming vear
will have to decide whether a tweekls
paper will materially affect the finances
of the Magazine and Quips and Cranks.
