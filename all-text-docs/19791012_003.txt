seemed a perfect example of the
stereotype artist with his out-
dated leather jacket. His strik-
ing wedding cake One Poisoned
Tongue Ruined the Entire Wed-
ding For Everyone shimmers
with the plastic dime store eyes
that change directions.

Nerenstein explains the im-
pact of his work, ‘The surface is
delicious. The painting spits at
you in the face.”

G.G. Kosh is a direct con-
trast to Nerenstein. She spoke
about the excitement and em-
barrassment she feels in going
to a show where her work is
exhibited. ‘‘I was afraid to walk
in,” she admits. Her circular
collage of ice-filled drinks en-
titled What Makes the Town Go
Round seemed to be one of the
most popular pieces at the
opening, especially amorig.stu-

by Frank Bliss, Ron Chapple,
Martha Straun, and Earl Law-
rimere add an important dimen-
sion to the show. Lawrimore
uses the idea of Malcolm X’s
Soul On Ice for his look at two

inmates called Single-Cell Lock-

Up, Huntersville Prison. Law-
rimore serves on the advisory
board of Huntérsville Prison
and had wanted to take pictures
before.

“This was the push I need-
ed,” says Lawrimore. ‘‘I decid-
ed to use this angle on the idea
of ice because with a photo-
graph it’s too easy to be
literal.”

Ice makes artists explore their media

show. Howard Spector created
Blue Ice Pic by taking several

‘photos of the same ice tray

under different lighting condi-
tions.the result is an impressive
design which even spells out the
word “‘ice.’’

Although much. of the art
exhibits a light-hearted feeling,
some pieces show concern for
serious problems. One of these
is a work which depicts the cold,
isolated lives that people are
forced to live in today’s society.
Eric Anderson, who teaches at
UNCC, describes his work “‘as
people on the outside looking in
on others.”’ The creation on
display is a silkscreen and
drawing entitled Charlotte On
V-ice and is from a series.

Anderson likes the idea of an
exhibit with a theme because “‘it
takes artists away from a
certain direction and makes
them explore. The integration
of Charlotte and Davidson art-
ists is also very rewarding.”

The ability to experience
different moods and techniques
keeps the exhibit fresh for the
observor. The plexiglas creation
called Ice Factorization is a/
kinetic piece which is delicately
activated by air and people
around it. More important than
the plexiglas itself is what
happens in the space around it,
especially the formation of sha-
dows. Bob Williams, usually a
printmaker, describes his work
as cubistic, fragmenting the
form of objects.

Art professors Herb Jackson
and Russ Warren, who coordi-
nated the show, also exhibit two
massive works. ‘‘Charlotte On
Ice’’ will be on display until
October 30th. Don’t miss the
chill of your life.
