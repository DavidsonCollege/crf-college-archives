FOREMAN AWAKENS STUDENTS
WITH SWELLING CHUCK WALLA

Dr. Kenneth J. Foreman opened the Spring Service here last
Sunday night with a sermon entitled: ‘‘A Question—Do You
Believe In The Supernaturalt’’ For his scripture he used Acts
26 :16, ‘‘ Why is it thought incredible by you that God raises the
dead,’ and Ephisians 6 :16, ‘‘ Above all, take the shield of faith
with which you ean quench all the flaming darts of the
evil one.”

With his captivating style, at once
relaxed, friendly, and intimate, and
at the same time forceful, concrete,
and combined with subtle drollery
he was insured of an interested, at.
tentive audience.

Anxious to clarify the issue in
the listener’s minds, Dr. Foreman
initiated his talk by distinguishing
between natural, anything describ-
able in terms of any exact science,
mystery, the result of seeing or be-
ing awate of something without
knowing its cause, unusual, a very
possible event, which, however,
rarely occurs, unnatural, a reversal
of the usual situation, for example,
man-biting-dog, and supernatural,
an event or object belonging not to
the natural order, not to be describ.
ed or predicted in the terms of any
science.

One classification Is cheap super-
natural — superstition, belief in
magic, ghosts, Santa Claus. Some
of these beliefs, as abtrology, are
bad — useless and wasteful, others,
as Santa Claus, serve a good, harm-
less, purpose. This cheap superna-
tural is of no value; if you believe
it, you are a shivering coward —
scary, “skeery,” if not, it is just a
joke to you. All this we can ignore,
knowing its fallancy. The super-
natural that is important to us is
twofold. The first part is “I,” not
my, brain or my body, just “TI.” I
am supernatural; 1 caknet-be ex
plained in physical or chemical
terms. Eyerything else will pass
‘away byt “me,”

Second is God — the source of
life, immortal, incorruptable pure,
indestructibly — supernatural.

We can draw only one conclu-
sion — make one answer to our
question, “Yes!” We do believe in
the supernatural, There is no choice
We can not help but believe — iu
the human supernatural and in the
divine supernatural. Obviously the
caterpillar has no choice of what
it does, but man has limited option,
“free-will.” Being confident of this,
we are admitting the human super-
natural. If a person has ever pray-
ed, and if he believes history has a
purpose, he acknowledges the di-
vine supernatural.

Look at the negative view point.
We believe it, or else. Have faith
in the human supernatural with a
free soul, or we are no more than
a tin machine. What a crushing and
foreboding thought, logically de-
stroying itself. Believe in the divine
supernatural —- God's plan and
purpose, moving clearly, expressed-

tieth or the twenty-first of this

Fraternity Houses
iF ollow Tuition In
‘Price Trend Upward

In a recent letter to the presi-
dents of the ten social fraternities.
and the Campus Club, Dr. John
R. Cunningham, President of the
College, announced that the rent
on each fraternity house for next
year will be $400; in addition, a fee
of $100 for maintenance will be
charged. .

” Previously, a, special committee
appointed by the trustees to study
sources of college income had rec-
ommended that the rent be increas.
ed from $300 per year to $500 per
year and the maintenance from $75
to $125 per year. This increase was
held to be necessary as a result of
the increased cost of operating the
College. The special committce in
its report, pointed out that the
‘value of each fraternity house has
risen from $5,000 in 1928, to $15.
000 in 1950, In that same period the
price of coal rose from $4.50 to
$11.50 per ton and the tuition and
fees of the College rose from $140
to $360 per year. Thus, while other
costs were rising from 1928 to
1950, the fent on fraternity houses
remained unchanged. The committee
felt that the higher rental would.

VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE PLANS

INCLUDE TESTS,

COUNSELING

By CHARLES BRYAN
The objective of the vocational aptitude tests, as stated two

weeks ago, is to provide students with concrete

information

about the functioning of their minds which will help or enable
them to choose a logical career. Because of the complexing of
the way the human mind operates, the tests and especially the

Davidson Graduate
Honored In Europe

Richard B. Vowles, Davidson
graduate of the class of 1938, was
nominated to spend the academic
year 1950-1951 as guest lecturer on
American literature at the Swedish
Universities of Uppsala and Stock-
holm. Several factors, including two
small children, made it impossible
for him to accept at this time, but
he has learned that the invitation
may be renewed in two years.

Dr. Vowles spent the year 1939-
1940 as American-Scandinavian Fel-
low in biochemistry at the Univer-
sity of Stockholm. Later he spent
some twenty months as American
vice-consul in Gothenburg, Sweden,
returning to America in the sum-
mer of 1946. Some of his transla-
tions of Swedish pocms have been

The actual testing will take place
over a period of two days includ-
ing about twelve hours of actual
tests and a few untimed question-

dents’ rooms.

After the tests have been grad.

dividual Test Profiles, indicating
degree of possession of many dif-
ferent traits,

The percentile score and percen-

The last program in the current Artists Series was present-

Chorale. The Chorale, acclaimed as the finest group of mixed
voices in recent years, is under the direction of Robert Shaw.

follow his father’s footsteps into the
ministry. He studied Theology at

Priest, Professors
Discuss Socialism

On Tuesday night in Phi Hall a
capacity crowd heard one of the
most interesting debates ever pre-
sented on the Davidson campus.
The occasion was the night of the
International Relation’s Club’s
“Town Meeting Of The Air” in
which the “Pros and Cons of the
Labor Government” was debated by
professors Guerrant and Pinkney
on the negative, and Professor Wil-
son and Monsignor Smith from Car.
lisle, England, on the affirmative.

The speakers were limited to ap-
proximately five minutes in their
constructive speeches, Professor
Guerrant began the debate with re-

California. To earn his way through
school,,he worked at odd jobs such
as wrapping bread for a bakery and
correcting examination papers.
While he was still an under-grad-
uate, thé director of the Pomona
Glee Club took a vacation, and
Shaw was drafted to fill his place.
Never having tried, he was not
certain that he could conduct a glee
club. He did try and has been con-
ducting ever since. In his Junior
year Fred Waring came west to
make a movie which was filmed
on the Pomona campus. He heard
Shaw's glee club and was so im-
pressed that he offered Shaw a job
with his own group if he (Shaw)
should ever come to New York. In
1938 Shaw took him at his word

marks centering around the gener-| 2%4 soon was training the Waring

al theme of socialism, that it was
far from something new and that it
was based on Plato's conceptions
that wise and just men could pile
an ideal state. The trouble with this
theory, said Guerrant, was that no
such man existed who were wise
enough or just enough. Guerrant
rather felt: that in a representative
democracy with different interests
held in line by checks and balances,
the people had more chance for
justice than under an all powerful
government.

Professor Wilson, was now given
the floor, and he emphasized that
socialism in England had never
been purely a theoretical and doc-
trinal matter only but that it defi.
nitely had historical manifestations.
First of all, it had its origin among
the people over one hundred years
ago with, therefore, this period to
gain experience. Secondly, socialism
was not to be identified with a
class movement, that it drew its
support from the middle as well as
the laboring classes. Professor Wil-
son defined English socialism as a
human movement expressing itself
in political terms.

Professor Pinkney voiced his be-
lief that too much power concen-
trated in government: might very
possibly lead to future tyranny.
Thus he envisioned socialism as
to the - point
where all people were employees of
the all powerful state, and that the
state became all things to all men.
Pinkney stated that in his opinion
regulated capitalism was a more
safe road to travel on than social-
ism. ; .

ductor of the Year by the Nation.
al Association of American Com-
posers and Conductors. In 1944
Shaw was guest conductor of the
CBS Symphony. Enlisting in the
Navy the next year, he found his
reputation had preceded him. He
was immediately put to work or-
ganizing a service glee club. Since
his discharge he has made a na-
tion-wide tour, does weekly radio
work, and somehow manages to
find time to execute his duties as
head of the choral department of
the Julliard School of Music.

His choristers have repeatedly
won the highest praise of discrim.
inating musicians for. the accuracy
and cleanness of their ensemble, the
delicacy of their interpretations,
and their wide range of dynamic
levels, from the most | subdued
pianissimo to tonal splendor that
threatens to take off the roof. A
specialty of the Shaw system is dic-
tion. When choruses trained unde-
Shaw perform, the words they arc
singing can be understood, an un-
usual characteristic of choral work.

The collegiate chorus has sung
its’ own concerts at Carnegie Hall,
Town Hall, and the New York City
Center, It has also appeared in _
choral works conducted by Arturo ,
Toscanini, Leopold Stokowski,
Serge Koussevitzky, and other not-
ed conductors. Under Shaw’s direc-
tion the group has recorded for
RCA.VICTOR. It has _ presented
first performances of works by

President's Open Letter
Explains Military Position

In recently endorsing a booklet.
Militariam In Education, Dr. Cun-
ningham, with other leading educa-
tors, voiced a doubt concerning the
wisdom of allowing the trend to-
ward increased military emphasis
among American Colleges and Uni-
versities, to continue. Since his ac-
tion has been given publicity by
newspaper articles and an editorial.
and since this publicity has caused
some misunderstanding in regard
to his original pprpose, Dr. Cun-
ningham has submitted the follow.
ing letter to the student body.

The booklet, Militarism In Edu-
cation, to which I have recently
lent endorsement, along with a con-
siderable number of persons asso-
ciated with other educational insti-
tutions in the country, takes note of
the increase in miliary activity and
influence in our American educa.
tional institutions. It states, “This
activity represented by military
subsidy in science departments, ex-
panded military training units, in-
creased use of schools and colleges
as recruiting grounds, and military
propaganda directed towards stu-
dents and faculty has serious impli-
cations both’for the future of our

nation and for world peace.” The
purpose of the booklet is not to
question our nation’s need of mili.
tary defense at this time but rather
to call attention to the very great
increases in the direction of over-
stressing the military in colleges ~
and universities. It has to do more
largely with the inappropriateness
of using colleges and universities so
extensively for military research
and military training. It is the be-
lief of the author and of those spon-
soring this booklet that there are
some agencies in the country such
as the church and such as our edu-
cational institutions which by their
very nature should lend themselves
to a positive program for peace.

Quoting-again from the preamble,
“The desperate need of the world
for peace demands leadership com.
mensurate with the need. Such lead-
ership is more likely to come from
those whose orientation and train-
ing during their educational career
is that of world brotherhood and
the spirit of free inquiry unhamper-
ed by narrow military considera-
tions,”

It is believed that our fellow citi.
