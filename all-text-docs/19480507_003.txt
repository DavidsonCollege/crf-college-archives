Last week we be-
van reviewing this
past year’s Wildcat
sports «slate, but we
ran out of space be-
fore. we got all
around, So we shall
continue this week to
pass out orchids. as
they are dhe.

With only a meet
with Mercer in Macon
Saturday remaining,
Coach Pete Whittle’s
track squad has hung
up a creditable sea-
son’s record of three
wins and two losses.
Led by Co-Captains &
Jack Gray and Jim
Vann, the cindermen
ran wild over Fur-
man, W&L, and The Citadel, but bowed to South Carolina
and Clemson.

Gray has remained unbeaten in both the mile and two-
mile runs in dual competition. Vann was slated for com-
petition in the Florida relays but had to drop out because of
a throat infection, He has picked up more than a few points
this year in both the diseus and the shot. Sprintman Ed New-
ton has surprised all this year in showing plenty of speed to
Cat supporters. Newton has amassed 43 points in five meets
which presents an average of more than eight points per
meet—not bad in any league. Ed hasn't received the credit
due in our estimation, so we'd like to give him a big pat on the
back for his efforts.

The Wildcat golfers, who probably get less notice than
any other of the squads, have turned in an enviable record of
eleven wins, three losses and one tie. They have bowed only to
State, U.N.C., and Rollins College while knotting with South
Carolina.

number one and two spots, followed by Monty Hill, Ford

Barton’s crack tennis squad which has been ‘the most success- «

ful. The racket wielders had pounded out ten straight® wins
before dropping a heartbreaker to the University of North
Carolina for the state championship, It was the only close one
the Cats had seen all year and it had to drop the wrong way.

But the netters bounced back strong and pinned a stinging
defeat on Duke’s vaunted Blue Devils, It was a signal honor
for Davidson because it marked the third Davidson victory
over a Duke athletic team this year, while the Durhamites
managed to win but one. The Cat basketball and baseball
squads had. previously turned the trick and Duke gained its
lone win in the semi-finals the Southern Conference
basketball tournament.

The squad gained more steam for its present northern
jaunt in rolling over Presbyterian College in its final home
appearance. Lone mishap of the occasion was the sprained
ankte of number three man Jerry Robinson, ‘* Wart’? has
shown great stuff all year and it is a severe blow to the,
crusade into Yankeeland.

Whit Cobb was also left home which left two spots in the
top six to be filled. It looks like they have been well filled, for
as we go to press we have reports of the 9-0 whitewash which
the Cats handed to Richmond’s Spiders Monday, Henry
Neisler and John Crosland stepped in to fill the singles spots
well. Crosland teamed with Roddey for doubles and Bill
Childs got with Rob Palmer for a doubles victory. The two
Keeslers hold the other duet spot.

Since this is the last edition of the year, we will be unable
to cover the remainder of the spring sports. It’s been. mighty
easy writing about successful teams and we hope we’ll have
the same delightful job text year.
