Tommy Bumbarger Elected To Edit Annual

Pan-Hellenic Council Elects

Mac Jefferies As President

“Sam Tate Made Secretary,
Ennett, Treasurer

Davidson’s Pan-Hellenic Counci)
in a called session at the house
of Kappa Sigma, on the afternoon
ot September 24th, elected its of-
ficers to serve for the year of 1945-
46. The president’s post went to
Mac Jeffries, theeK. A. representa-
tive, while Sam Tate of Phi Delta
Theta and George Ennett, Kappa
Sigma,.were elected to the offices
of secretary and treasurer, respect-
ively. The new Council, under the
leadership of these men, has al-
ready arranged, in. most part, for
Home-coming dances; the first of
which is to be held at the Armory
Auditorium in Charlotte on Novem-
ber first. .

Jeffries, now a senior, eritered
school here in the fall of ’40 and
was quite active on the campus be-
fore going into the army in ’43.
He served on the editorial staff of
Quips and Cranks, managing editor
of the Davidsonian, a member of
the Scabbard and Blade, and was
elected to the presidency of the
Kappa Alpha social fraternity in
1943. Mac was a first lieutenant
and fought through Belgium and
Germany. Secretary of the coun-
cil and representative of Phi Delta
..Theta_is Sam Tate, who entered
Davidson in the fall of ’41, as did
George Ennett, the Council treas-
urer and representative of Kappa
Sigma. Both men were on’ the
Davidsonian staff and active in the

‘nudent bedy prior to their
ture in February of 1943,

Tate was with the Ninetieth Divi-
sion for two and a half years, fight-
ing through France, Luxembourg,
and Belgium, where he was cap-
tured and held by the Germans for
three months,

depar-

Ennett fought through Belgium,
Holland, and Germany with the
HNighty-fourth, returning to David-
son in’ February of this year.
George, who is well known around
the college and the community, is
a quite active member of the stu-
dent body, serving as senior p-
resentative on the of con-
trol this year.

21 Year Olds

Another of the traditions of
Davidson was broken last week
when the Executive Committee of
the Faculty reversed its stand on
the question of student automobilés
in reference to all students over
21 years old.

Dean Bailey emphasized the fact
that the car which a student regis-
ters must be his own property or
that of his parents. Any violation

of this registration rule will be
treated as a breach of the honor
system

This semester will be a proba-
tionary period, during which time
or at the end of which the com-
mittee may revoke the privilege for
any abuse of it or for any other
pertinent reason. Any student who
has this privilege will be subject
to having it revoked in his par-
ticular case if he should be put on
probation for overcutting or low
gradgs..

The cars are to be used only as
a means of transportation to and
from the community. Use on the
campus and between the dormito-
ries and the boarding houses would
create a traffic problem; therefore
it is requested that the student not
use_his_car in-such cases. Park-
ing of cars is to be in certain areas
designated by the college unless
permission is given to park else-
where.

Queens Brawl

By Jack Ticklebottom

Iam a yelled at, court controlled,
red hatted, laundry carrier for all
upperclassmen i.e. a freshman at
Davidson College. On Tuesday we
were told that Queens College
somewhere in Charlotte must have
at least 100 men from our class
in order to make their square dance
Little did I know what
a square that rhythmic brawl was
going to be like when I boldly
raised my finger signifying my de-
sire to see what happens in a girl's
college.

Ail was tense as our bus came
to a stop on Queen’s campus. Out
stepped innocent—innocent, that is
boys with freshly pressed clothes
and smelling of rose water. We
were then herded into the corral,
Queens reception roorf, and imme-

a success,

diately surrounded by screaming
‘females.- We felt for certain this
was our last round-up. As our

names were called out and we an-
swered, some siren would snatch
us by the most availableHimb and
drag us off, calling to the rest of
her man-starved crew, “I got one
but I think it’s a dud” She called
a “dud’—me with my -new
herringbone suit, white shirt; brown
tie and shoes, red and yellow golf
socks, and my neatly folded rain-
coat (I had\plans for a’ big night
and did not want anything to go
LW rong.)

It had been previously arranged
that there were to be two teams, one
Yellow and the other the Blue.
The Yellow was to dance first, then
