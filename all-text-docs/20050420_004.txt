killed and 2 million more displaced from
their homes since early 2003.

Shestak described the situation in Darfur
as “Rwanda in slow motion” in his introduc-
tory remarks to Sunday’s lecture.
Rusesabagina commented on Darfur as well,
expressing disbelief that another Rwanda
was occuring only 12 years after the interna-
tional community promised “never again” to
future genocides.

The students who brought Rusesabagina
to campus recognized the power hearing the
story of a genocide survivor could have in
inspiring U.S. action in Darfur.

Shestak said, “[Rusesabagina] noted that
we will all someday face history. I think as
students we want to consider what we are
going tell our grandkids we did during
the Darfur genocide. I
would hope that we
would look at this man,
and realize that if he can
save 1,268 lives, we can
get up off our asses and
call our senators and
representatives. Such
a simple action could
end up saving hundreds
of thousands more than
Paul ever could have.”

Kristen Psaki °07
noted that Rusesabagina’s personal experi-
ence added a sense of urgency to the current
atrocities in Darfur. “Paul giving his story is
so much greater than politics,” she said. “It is
about a survivor of genocide and a hero.”

Will Scheffers ’06, president of Davidson
African Students Association (DASA) said
that the lecture demanded more out of the

audience, challenging them to address social

issues otherwise written off. “The lecture
was not what we are used to. It was about
retelling the story and making [the genocide]
real for us,” he said.

Rusesabagina spoke during the lecture
about the obstacles he faced as manager of
the Mille Collines Hotel in Kigali in April
1994. In the process of protecting his wife
and children, he saved 1,200 lives, even as
militias surrounded his hotel, threatening his
family, and as the international community
stood idly by.

Of the guilt Rusesabagina said he would
have felt had he done nothing, he said, “I
would not have been able to eat. I would not
have been able to drink. I would not have
been able to feel.”

Molly. Langer ’07, another student

involved in bringing

Rusesabagina to

Davidson, said she

was struck by his

humble character. “I

liked that he kept it

simple and told his
story. He didn’t dram-
atize what happened

.. He kept it person-

al.”

Laura Broom ’07
agreed, “He was so
soft-spoken. That’s what we needed, some-
thing simple and sincere. He was clearly
genuine.”

When asked on Sunday what he thought of
former President Bill Clinton’s apology to
the Rwandan people in 1998 for the West’s
inaction, Rusesabagina said, “Words are
great, but actions are better.”

Hauser, continued from page 1

These words aptly describe the game plan
Shestak’s group devised for creating noise
about the situa- .
tion in Darfur.

Last week, the
group, with the
assistance of sev-
eral campus
organizations, set
up a table in the
Union urging
members of the
college commu-
nity to call or fill
out form letters
to their congress-
men for support
of the Darfur

Accountability Act, a resolution seeking the .

enlargement of African Union troops cur-
rently in Darfur and harsh punishments
against the Sudanese government.

Broom said, “I think the act is an opportu-
nity to show that this is an issue that matters
to people.”

So far 160 phone calls have been made
and 532 form letters filled out. Psaki found
the student support encouraging for campus
activism, commenting, “Perhaps apathy is a
thing of the past.”

Broom added that the group is amazed at
the support they have received. “I didn’t
anticipate as much community support,” she
said. “That has been great.”

Given continued interest, the group plans
on keeping the table up this week with one
addition: “We’re also going to add President
Bush to the calling list,” said Broom.

While the students attribute the event’s
success to aggressive advertising and sup-

ism. For me, he didn’t just succeed in teach-
ing me about the moral issues that face jour-
nalists, but he made me care about the peo-
ple that surround us everyday. Not an easy
task, and not a man I will soon forget.”

Others echoed thé support he gave outside
the classroom. Leslie Hempson ’06, a stu-
dent in the Journalism and Media Law class,
said, “As a visiting professor Mr. Hauser
didn’t know as many of the students as other
professors, but he dove right
into the lives of those he had
in class. He went out to lunch
with students, attended their
baseball games, and encour-
aged them to come talk with
him in his office about the
newspaper business and
life.”

Last Monday night, he
delivered the Batten lecture,
“Media, Money, Monopoly,
and Madness,” and spoke
realistically about the chal-
lenges facing journalism
today.

“Quality journalism will survive,” Hauser
said. “The good, big newspapers will survive
as they are the only medium that can set the
national standard for news. The local news-
papes will survive by providing accurate,
detailed coverage of local news.”

~Such an observation could not come from
a more experienced journalist.

Professor Hauser began his journalism
career writing for The Daily Tar Heel more
than 50 years ago. His work took him around
the globe, to North Carolina, Virginia, Rhode
Island, London, and Paris.

It was in Providence, RI, however, that he
made his most controversial mark on jour-
nalism law. He served as the executive editor
of the Providence Journal-Bulletin from
1973 to 1989 at a time when the Mafia per-
vaded the state government.

n a case .involving Freedom of
Information Act files, Hauser disobeyed a
federal judge’s gag order to print a story on a
prominent Mafia family. Facing jail time,
Hauser fought the case all the way to the
Supreme Court, where, two years later, he
was Cleared of all charges.

Duke Performances Hall was filled to capacity.

port of the student body, President Vagt
praised the group’s determination, particu-
larly Shestak’s.

“It is one
more lesson in
what one stu-
dent can do
when he or she
puts [his or her]
mind to it,”
Vagt said.

Vagt had sent
Shestak an
email last week
as the group
sought Duke as
the venue for
Paul’s lecture
over the previously scheduled 900 Room. He
commented that a partially-full audience
would not be desirable, and then perhaps the
group should keep the lecture in the 900
Room.

Shestak, disappointed by the email, said,
“I took it personally, but maybe he was being
honest ... no one expected the turnout that
we got.”

Vagt now says he regrets the email, “I
never should have doubted him ... He
proved me absolutely wrong.”

Shestak hopes. the community will contin-
ue raising awareness on Darfur.

“As cliched as this sounds, students are
central to the mission of changing U.S. poli-
cy,” he said. “After all, the end to apartheid
was brought about primarily by college stu-
dents. We did it then, and we can do it again
in Darfur. Sudan can’t wait. The death toll is
well over 10,000 a month and rising in
Darfur. Our action must come now.”

Hauser graduated from UNC Chapel Hill
in 1954 and served the U.S. Army in Korea
for three years, for which he was awarded a
Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. During his
tenure at the Journal-Bulletin, the paper won
a Pulitzer Prize and was named as a finalist
six other times.

Professor Hauser’s
inspired his students.

Hempson said, “It was special for all of us
to learn about media law from someone who
had spent his entire career
working as a journalist, some-
one who could tell us what it
felt like to hear his case
argued in front of the
Supreme Court of the United
States ... At a time when the
American press is criticized
for almost everything it does,
it was refreshing to hear from
someone who firmly believed
in the power of the news
media to change our country
for the better.” :

His contributions added to
the proud legacy of the Batten
professorship at Davidson.

President Vagt said, “‘He very much set the
standard for what a Batten professor can be
in a low-key way ... I would tell him, ‘I hear
you’re doing some terrific things with these
kids.’ He would always respond, ‘I am learn-
ing from these students every day.’”

Final projects in Hauser’s classes were due
this week. Without him, “those classes will
basically just have to stop,” said Dean of
Faculty Clark Ross. “Students will turn in
their final papers.” He explained that the cre-
dentials of the Batten professor are too
unique for another professor to fill that role.

Ross indicated an external source familiar
with journalism writing would likely grade
the papers and projects, and those results
would be tabulated along with scores: from
the earlier parts of the semester.

Hauser is survived by his wife, Jane, of 48
years; his son, David; his daughter, Susan;
and his brother, William.

Professor Hauser’s funeral took place
today at 2 p.m. at Christ United Methodist
Church in Chapel Hill, N.C. Several students
had expressed their intention to attend.
