Wives, was rather long and extended
around the entire length of the gym-
nasium, but everyone seemed glad to
make the rounds and greet the old mem-
bers of the faculty and meet the latest
additions to their number, :

After each present had become
acquainted with neighbor, Dwight
Chalmers, “Y" secretary, introduced in
turn the speakers and other entertainers
of the evening. Julian Price extended a
brief but cordial welcome in behalf of
the Y. M. C. A. Professor Currie then
spoke on adaptiig one’s mind to one’s
environment. He urged the new men
and the old to put their greatest stress
on scholastic achievement this year.

ability to return, then welcomed the new
men to the student body. Murdock Me-
I.eod presented a short humorous sketch
entitled “Gathering Nuts,” the caste be-
ing composed of members of the faculty
and of the student body, all called upon
without previous notice. This was im-

briefly outlined the past of The David-

he kept the gift himself, -

Suitable refreshments, in the form of
ice cream and:cake, were then served
in ample abundance, and whispers of
“How many did you get?’ were heard
from all over the building, and several
prominent students were forced to re-
port to the infirmary Tuesday morning.

STUDENT BODY PRESIDENCY
VACANT WITH DICK NOT BACK

Leonard Dick, elected last spring as
president of the student body, is unable
to return to college this year on ac-
count of the sickness of his father. All
those who knew our small but well-built
and friendly leader regret exceedingly
that he cannot be back with us. He has
sent us a message and some fine sug-
gestions for forward steps, but this is
not Jike having him present. All hope
that his plan to return next year will
materialize. . :

As this article goes to press the stu-
dents are expecting to have a meeting
eon Wednesday to elect a new president,
and it is hoped that a man of as strong
personality as the president the students
have lost will be secured.

LIBRARY NEWS

The Davidson College library, endow-
ed by the late Mr. Carnegie, is one of
the best equipped of its class in the
South. It is located at the beginning of
Dormitory Row, just back of Shearer
Hall, facing ‘south. A spacious reading
room covers half of the lower floor and
contains all of the periodicals, both reli-
gious and social. Many of the leading
newspapers of the country can be found
in-the racks. When a fellow is feeling
blue and homesick, the reading room is
a dandy place ‘to go. Try it, fellows.
The whole upper floor of the library is
given up to books and bound periodicals
from Noah’s time to date. There are
now 28,834 volumes in the library and
new books are added every few months.
If you have been upstairs you have not
failed to notice the six loving cups, just
in front of the palm. They have been
won in inter-collegiate contests, debat-
ing, football, and baseball.
