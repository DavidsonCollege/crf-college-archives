THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 8, 1928

HAMPTON INSTITUTE QUARTET
PRESENTS SPLENDID PROGRAM

Hampton College Quartet rendered a
Pleasing program of negro spirituals in
Shearer Hall, Friday, March 2nd. A large
audience listened to the songs with keen in-
terest and deep appreciation. The voices of
all the singers were good but conisiderable
praise fell to the lot of J. H. Wainwright,
bass. Mr. G. F. Ketchum and Mr. R. O.
Purves, teachers at the training school, ac-
companied the quartet and made short talks
between the various groups of spirituals.

The Hampton Quartet returned to give a
much varied program from that presented
here last year. Only one change has been
made in te members who compose the quar-
tet. This year G. H. White sang second
tenor, while all the other men returned for
their second time. W. E. Creekmur sang
first tenor; J. Thomas, baritone, and Ay tal
Wainwright, bass.

Dr. T. W. Lingle introduced Mr. G. F.
Ketchum, who in turn introduced the quartet.
During the short intermissions of the sing-
ing Mr. Ketchum spoke of the songs sung
by the negroes and the natural ability of
obtaining harmony in their voices, He stated
that in place of long hours of practicing in
a group, the singers went aff alone and com-
posed their various parts, which would be in
perfect harmony when sung. He said fur-
ther that the only races whose voices have
been found to blend well without practice
are the Ethiopian and Slavic tribes.

Mr. R. O. Purves made the final talk of
the evening. He gave a brief account of the
work done at Hampton Tastitute. The ne-
groes there, he said, are given training for
the leadership of their race. There are at
the school.this year 960 students, and to this
number is taught the principles of business,
agriculture, economics and other necessary
subjects. He also stated that a number. of
graduates of the institute are now in various
parts of North Carolina teaching school.

The program of the evening was as fol-
lows: :

1. Hampton Quartet—“Ezekiel Saw the
Wheel ;” “Give That Old-Time Religion ;”
“Roll, Jordan, Roll!” “Walk in Jerusalem.” |

2. Mr. Ketchum—Talk. |

3. .Hampton Quartet—“I Done Open My |
Mouth to the Lord;” “I Got To Lie Down pl

Mr. Guthrie Gives |

Prohibition Talks

Mr. Paul N. Guthrie, Field Secretary of

ica and the world.

Mr. Guthrie is a graduate of the Univer-
sity of Tennessee and has spent some time
as assistant secretary of the Y. M. C. A.
at the University of Georgia. This past
summer he. was a member of the Intercol-
legiate Summer Service Group in New York
and was engaged in social service work
there. He has had special training for his

present task and is now in the midst of a}

tour through the colleges and universities
of the South.

Mr. Guthrie found Davidson men anxious
to discuss matters relating to prohibition
and was much pleased with his visit here.
This, the 85th campus which he has visited
in the last five months, compared favorably
with any visited on the tour.

According to Mr. Guthrie, the future of
prohibition is in the hands of the college
students of today. If the latter can be
aroused in favor of prohibition’s” benefits, |
the future will take care of itself.

A mass of misinformation has hurt the
cause of “drys” and “wets” alike. Books
like Irving Fisher's “Prohibition at Its
Worst” help to clear away many prevalent
misconceptions.

Mr. Guthrie left here Friday evening for
Greensboro, where he will speak at N. C.!
C. W. He will arrive in Washington head- |
quarters in about two weeks, after which he
will make a tour of New England educa- |

|
tional institutions. |
