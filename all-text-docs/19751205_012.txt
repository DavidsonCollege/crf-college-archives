Gridders end dismal (1-8) season

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY

Davidson finished its 1975 football
season with losses to Lafayette and
Appalachian State to conclude a 1-8
campaign.

Coming off an impressive perfor-
mance against powerful Lehigh, the
Wildcats appeared flat in their 31-3
loss to Lafayette.

Davidson scored first on a 40 yard
field goal by Joe Duncan early in the
first quarter, but a 69 yard punt
return by John Orrico for the Leo-
pards set up Lafayette’s go ahead
touchdown. The Wildcats never re-
captured the lead.

For Farrell the game was a disap-
pointment after his team’s effort the
week before.

“T was very disappointed in the
Lafayette game because I felt we had
an opportunity to win the game and
then didn’t play very well at all. If we
and played ‘as we did against Lehigh
we would have won.

“We got ahead early and had a
chance for some more points to nail

ey oneal

physical mismatch,” said Farrell.

the lid on the coffin but we didn’t do
that,’’ Farrel noted.

Against Appalachian State, David-
son was again soundly defeated, this
time by the score of 52-7. Once again
a long punt return set up the first
score for the Appalachian when Ford
returned a Joe Duncan kick 59 yards
to the Davidson 36 yard line. The
Mountaineers scored three plays
later.

Appalachian continued to score as
they capatalized on frequent David-
son turnovers and quickly built a
commanding 24-0 lead. —

Davidson’s only touchdown came
late in the second quarter when Chris
Crosby blocked a punt which the
Wildcats recovered on the Mountain-
eer’s nine yard line.

Sid Osborne then hit Terrell Rhye
with a touchdown pass and Duncan
added faerie

‘‘We ‘fidd to cope with the disap-
pointment of the Lafayette game and
another reason for our poor showing
in the Appalachian game was just the

‘“‘We hung in there for awhile but
we made a few mistakes that we
couldn’t afford because they are a
good football team.”’

Farrell was disappointed in his
team’s 1-8 record but feels that next

year’s team has greater potential than
the Davidson teams of the past few
years.

“For the first time in my tenure I
can see a nucleus for spring practice
that will be good enough to make
some solid improvements. Next year
is the year it should be evident that
there is marked improvement in
Davidson football.”’

Also encouraging for the Wildcats
is the fact that they will lose only
seven Senoirs to graduation and have

only one player drop from the team.

Farrell also believes that team moral
has remained high despite only win-
ning one game this year.

‘We finished with a group of people

who'expressed the fact that they were
disappointed but all of whom have a
great optimism for the future..’

“I’m sorry that we couldn’t have

given Davidson a better football team
in my two years so far but I am

encouraged that all the signs for the
future are positive and that we are
accomplishing what we set out to
accomplish,” Farrell explained.
