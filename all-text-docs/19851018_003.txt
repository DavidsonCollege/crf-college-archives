Beyond Davidson

By JANE AURELL
Internationally —

In the aftermath of the Achille Lauro
hijacking, four U.S. F-14 jet fighters in-
tercepted an Egyptian plane carrying the
Palestinian hijackers and forced it to land
at the NATO base in Sicily. Four of the
hijackers are being held by Italy on
charges of hijacking and murder, and a
warrant is out for the arrest of four other
Palestinians believed to be involved.

After a brief detainment, Muhammad
Abbas, the Palestinian believed to be the
mastermind of last week’s hijacking, was
allowed to leave Italy for Yugoslavia; he
has been eluding authorities ever since.
The U.S. has a warrant for his arrest.
Meanwhile, the body of Leon Klinghof-
fer (the American murdered in the hijack-
ing) washed ashore on the Syrian coast;
the body contained wounds in the head
and back. The hijackers have repeatedly
denied the killing, so this could be the
key needed by Italy to start the prosecu-
tion proceedings. The U.S. said that in-
dictments for the extradition of the hijac-
kers could be issued if the Jtalian courts
fail to prosecute them. In the wake of the
hijacking, Israel has offered a new
Mideast peace initiative excluding the
PLO and the USSR.

Other Middle Eastern news — In
Lebanon, members of the Islamic Jihad
have turned over to the U.S. photos of a
body believed to be that of hostage Wil-
liam Buckley; they say that they will ex-
change the body for the release of 100
Palestinians jailed in Israel. Islamic ex-
tremists are threatening to execute three
Soviet hostages and blow up the Soviet
Embassy unless the USSR closes the em-
bassy. In continued efforts to end the ten
year civil war in Lebanon, which has
claimed over 100,000 lives, Syria has
proposed a new peace initiative to the
three major Lebanese militias; Syria re-
ports the outlook to be favorable.

In South African Developments —
Over the weekend, leaders from the Afri-
can National Congress and from South
Africa’s white opposition party met in
Zambia; the two groups agreed on the ur-
gent need to abolish apartheid and estab-
lish a “non-racial democratic society,”
but the ANC said that it felt that the situa-
tion in South Africa was not amenable to
peaceful resolution at this time. The
ANC is urging South Africa’s 25 million
blacks to take their battle against apar-
theid into white areas; the first white
army fatality caused by blacks occurred
in a white area shortly following this pro-
nouncement.

Central America — In the biggest
rebel attack in over a year, Salvadoran re-
bels fighting the government of President
Duarte attacked a US built military train-
ing camp in El Salvador; the rebels re-
ported that their aim was to kill or capture
US military advisors. As a consequence
of the still unresolved kidnapping of his
daughter, President Duarte has sent his

three other children and four grandchil-
dren to the US for safe keeping. In
Panama, an unidentified military leader
disclosed a paper accusing the U.S. of
backing a sedition plan to topple its gov-
emment. In Nicaragua, blaming the US
government of instigating sabotage and
political instability in the Sandinista re-
gime, President Ortega has ordered the
suspension of civil rights.

Elsewhere in the world -- An earth-
quake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale
rocked Soviet Central Asia; the extent of
the damage is unknown. Vietnam said
that it will allow US excavation teams to
search for the remains of Americans still

Among the proposed changes
are the abolition of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and an expansion
of authority for the defense sec-
retary and the joint operating
commanders

unaccounted for. In West Germany, the
total number of spy-related arrests has
risen to eleven. The USSR announced
that Nikolai Talyzin (56) will replace the
retiring Nikolai Baibakov (74) as the new
state planning chief. Libyan leader Qad-
dafi and Soviet leader Gorbachev met in
Moscow to discuss the Mideast, Africa
and the Iran-Iraq war. And finally, in
Stockholm, Sweden, the Nobel Peace
Prize was awarded to the International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear

War. The group was founded five years
ago by American and Soviet doctors and
now claims a membership of 145,000
doctors and health professionals from 40
countries.

Domestically --

Congress secretly approved an ad-
ministration request for $250 million in
further covert military aid to rebels fight-
ing the Soviet backed regime in Af-
ghanistan; the aid will be funneled to the
rebels through the CIA. Senator Paul
Laxalt R-Nev. was sent to the Philippines
with a message to President Marcos that
his regime is in danger of being toppled
by the New People’s Army, a communist
insurgency movement. Vice President
Bush is on a six day visit to China to try to
ease the strained relations caused by
American arms sales to Taiwan and the
congressional effort to impose import re-
strictions on Chinese textiles. A biparti-
san Senate military panel is seeking to re-
form and reorganize the Pentagon;
among the proposed changes are the
abolition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
an expansion of authority for the defense
secretary and the joint operating com-
manders.

Doctors removed another patch of
skin cancer from President Reagan's
nose. Yul Brynner (65), who played the
king 4625 times in The King and I, died
last Thursday. Orson Welles (70), the
talented author, actor and producer, died
the same day.

made a mistake, and I'll show you some-

Administrators voice views on vandalism

By KEITH FINCH

Vandals have caused over
$7,000 worth of damages to col-
lege and personal property since
the beginning of the term.

Davidson Police Chief Jackie
Hughes is convinced that nearly
all of the problem is due to alcohol
abuse. He said much vandalism
occurs at or near a party where al-
cohol is served, and that the few
vandals apprehended are usually
intoxicated.

Hughes said there is a definite
increase in vandalism over last
year.

Eleven lampposts on and near
Patterson Court have been des-
troyed in the last five weeks. In
other incidents, a branch was
hurled through the window of
Emanon house and a brick was
thrown through the window of a

student’s truck. Exit signs have
been destroyed; light globes have
been smashed; fire extinguishers
have been discharged, and water
fountains have been ripped from
the wall.

“I don’t know what the cause
is,’ Dean of Students Will Terry
said. He added, “It just doesn't
make any sense. It’s sort of like
burning down your own ghetto.”

Hughes agreed, “I just can’t
understand it.”

Dean Terry agreed that “at
least some of it is alcohol abuse,”
and that people who normally
would not commit vandalism
while sober are often the same
ones who do it while they are
drunk. He said, “That’s no ex-
cuse.”

Tom Jennings handles indoor van-
dalism. He said, “Mostly men are
the ones who vandalize, and it's
usually men who've been drink-
ing.”

“If a floor is more involved as
a community, then there is less
vandalism,” Jennings said. “Here
people’s commitments are to
fraternities or eating houses, and
so there is more vandalism.”

He said that floors which pro-
mote hatl community are the least
likely to experience vandalism.
An example of such a hall, he
said, is the second floor of Irwin
dormitory, where the residents
have hung posters and ‘“‘made the
public areas a better place to live.”

Jennings said he expects to see
much more vandalism in the com-
ing winter months when students
tend to feel “cooped up” inside.

Possible Solutions

Jennings has already taken
many measures to prevent van-
dalism. So far this term damages
to housing have amounted to less
than $300.

Among his new policies is the
requirement that R.A.s report all
damages to public places such as
lounges and bathrooms at the be-
ginning of the year. This informa-
tion will make it possible to deter-
mine the extent of a group's dam-
age to its dormitory. If no one ad-
mits to damaging something,
“then a whole area will be
charged,” Jennings said.

Jennings has also instituted a
Resident Advisor duty system
giving students access to an R.A.
at all times.

Terry believes it would be best
for students to solve the problem

by themselves. “We've got to take
the Code of Responsibility seri-
ously,” he said. “I take it seri-
ously, That's why Davidson stu-
dents have the freedom they have.
Most of them don't realize the
amount of freedom they have.” In
a letter to The Davidsonian last
week, Terry indicated that free-
dom could be curtailed if students
do not restrain themselves.

Among other options, Terry is
considering requiring houses to
hire security guards to watch par-
ties, to register their parties with
the college or to police the dis-
pensing of alcohol more carefully.
Yet he hopes that students will
solve the problem on their own.
“Apathy and gutlessness are the
only obstacles to a solution,” he
said.
