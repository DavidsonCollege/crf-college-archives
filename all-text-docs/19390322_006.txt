DR. GWYNN ADDRESSES

[Continued from Page Five)
practices foreign to our social ord-

er would be permitted to pass.
Take, for instance, Joseph Smith,
who started a religious sect be-
lieving in polygamy. As long as
his followers lived out with the
Indians, they were left alone; but
when they desired entrance into

the United States, they had to give
up their practices.

The second duty of a Davidson
graduate is active participation in
democratic processes. Our fran-
chise is a sacred instrument and
we must use, protect, and serve it.
According to Dr. Gwynn, an amaz-
ing number of the white-collar
citizens do not even vote. The
well-educated members of our cit-
izenry must give of their time and
money, if necessary, in order that
our government shall continue to
function to the best advantage. In
this connection, Dr. Gwynn men-
tioned a well-known educator who
ruined his health in the service of
his state.

Final Duty

The third, and final duty set
forth by Dr. Gwynn for a David-
son graduate is to act as a shining
example in the support and observ-
ance of the law.. One should do
his utmost to obey every law. un-
less it violates one’s own personal
convictions, in which case, he
should explain to a court his con-
duct and do his utmost to have the
law repealed. Dr. Gwynn closed
by saying that every man is his
own policeman and that true self-
discipline comes from free choice
of the right.

Dr. Gwynn has consented to
teach the Sunday School Lesson
again on the first Sunday morning
after the Spring Holidays.

Many students have probably no-
ticed or read a serial article called
“As I Saw It” in the Saturday
Evening Post by Edith Bolling Wil-
son. This serial plus some, more
material has been combined into
My Memoir. As widow of the
World War-time U. S. President,
Mrs. Wilson gives information on
Woodrow Wilson's, and so, indi-
rectly, the nation’s affairs. Besides
being a good portrait of the ex-
President, the book is interestingly
written.

The greatest Christian in Japan,
possibly in the world, is Toyohiko
Kagawa. In his latest book, Medi-
tations on the Holy Spirit, he re-
veals his devotional life and deepest
theological beliefs, points out the
manifestations of the Holy Spirit
in prater and God-conscious living,
discusses the power of the Holy
Spirit in the lives of Christ and the
Apostles.

AGEING—Chesterfield’s mild
ripe tobaccos, like fine wines, are
aged for two or more years in huge
wooden casks. Here they gradu-
ally acquire that true Chesterfield
mildness and better tastewhich give
millions of smokers more pleasure.

STEMMING —“Almost human”
is what they say about the inter-
esting stemming machines, whose
fingers pick up the tobacco, leaf
by leaf and take out the stem,
leaving only the mild, tender,
good-tasting part of the leaf to go
into the making of Chesterfields.

BLENDING —There is only one

American and Turkish tobaccos.
Just the right proportions to make
Chesterfield a milder, better-tast-

MAKING — Almost faster than
the eye can follow, Chesterfields

Chesterfields are always round, firm
and wal: filled.

PACKAGING—Truly amazing
are the packaging machines which
wrap and seal Chesterfields in
their air-tight, moisture-proof

packages. Regardless of where
you buy-t , Chesterfields reach
you as fresh as the day they were
made.
