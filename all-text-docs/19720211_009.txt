Scandling Defends Record

As Matters Host Wolfpack

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

The Davidson wrestling team
hosts the North Carolina State
Wolfpack tonight at 7 p.m., and
one Wildcat grappler will try
to maintain his unbeaten sea.
son.

John Scandling, a sophomore
from Alexandria, Va., carries a
7-0-1 mark into the match against
the powerful Wolfpack, a team
which blanked the 'Cats 36-0 last
year and is considered even
stronger this year by Davidson
coach Charlie Parker.

“They rank second only to
Maryland in the ACC, and they
are really tough,” commented
Parker.

For Scandling, the match will
provide him with a chance to
avenge a 3-0 defeat he suffered
in the North Carolina Collegiate

Championships earlier in the
season.
That loss does not count

against his overall record.

“‘T'm in better shape now than
when I wrestled the State guy
before, and I’m looking forward
to this match,” Scandling said.

Scandling was the outstanding
performer for the ’Cats in the
meet held here last weekend,
which saw the matters defeat
Furman 26-14 but lose to The
Citadel 24-13 and VMI 28-12.

He captured all three of his
matches, and in the process he
upset a Citadel grappler who
finished second in the confer-
ence last year.

In that exciting match, the
first period ended in a 4-4 dead-
lock. Scandling took the ‘‘up”
position for the second period
and simply rode his man until
time expired. The Bulldog wres-
tler assumed the ‘“‘up” position

for the final period and rode
Seandling in a similar manner.

Scandling managed to escape
with only 2/3 of a second re-
maining, and he took the match
54. “I don’t even remember
how I got out,” he remarked.

Adapting to wresiling at Dav-
idson presented a marked chan-
ge from Scandling’s approach to
the sport in high school,

“In the Northern Virginia
area we have really strong com-
petition, and my _ high school
had a tough team. Here there
is more school work to do, and
I can’t put in as much time
with wrestling as I did then.

“TI like the wrestling philos-
ophy here, and I enjoy compet-
ing. There is not much pressure
placed on us, and it's a great
break from studying,” he ex-
plained.

Scandling feels that mental at-
titude plays an important role
in preparation for a match.

‘Physically I just use the ba
sic moves, and I think I have a
good synthesis of what I need.
We work on smoothing out our
Style in practice, but you've got
to be mentally ready also,” he
noted.

In analyzing the season so far,
Parker said that the ’Cats would
be limping into tonight’s match.

‘‘We've had a real good year,
but a lack of depth has hurt
us. We'll be without Randy Web-
ster tonight because he has
gone to Hollins for the spring
term, and there is no one of his
caliber to replace him,” Parker
pointed out.

Injuries have impaired the
performances of senior Ronnic
Williams and junior Jim Pur-
cell, while heavyweight Bill Gar-
rett is in his first year of wres-

‘Cats Host Augusta

The Davidson swimming team
puts a 4-4 season mark on the
line this afternoon with a match
with Augusta College.

The Augusta team defeated
the ’Cats in a meet earlier this
year, amd is a favorite in to-
day’s contest, according to Tom
Stevens, Davidson swimming
Coach.

The swimmers have split two
contests since the first of this
month, defeating Belmont-Abbey
and then dropping a match to
Appalachian.

Stevens sees the Augusta
match as a chance for two of

his leading nators, Jack Hobbs
and Rusty Saylor, to break some
school records.

Both Hobbs and Saylor have
been approaching record set-
ting times during the season, but
due to lack of adequate prac-
tice time and ill health, neither
has been able to break the pre-
sent marks.

‘‘Both Hobbs and Saylor had
the flu,” Stevens said, ‘‘and
Rusty was unable to go to Ap-
palachian. When you miss a few
days of swimming practice you
can't get into good enough shape
to break records.”

tling Parker noted that
Garrett had done well against
some very tough opponents.

The matters in the lower
weight classes have done excep-
tionally well,

In addition to Scandling, this
kreup includes freshman Bob
Jacobs, junior Rob Benton and
Junior Rusty Winchester.

Parker described both Jacobs
and Bentcn as greatly improv-
ing wrestlers, and termed Win
chester “ai wild card man for
US, a great asset.”

Winchester has Jost. only once
this season, and he has been val-
uable to the team because of
his ability. to change weight
classes to fit the team needs.
He has competed at both the 134
and 152 levels.

The wrestlers have the con-
ference tournament ahead — of
them in the coming weeks, and
they should firish a solid fourth.

This would be no disgrace.

If the men in the heavier
weight classes can help the little
&uys out, the 'Cats have a shot
at taking third place away from
VMI.
