Art In The Balance

The Arts and Davidson.

A few years ago saying this would
have been ludicrous. Art was viewed
as a frill and as having no hard-nosed
use then. It certainly didn’t lend itself
to a successful pursuit of the dollar,
the reassurance of a congregation or
the securing of a long list of patients.

But that was a few years ago, you
say. Now we have a Fine Arts Build-
ing with all its excellent facilities that
visitors are so impressed.with. Its
lights are on every night and it is the
hub of activity in music, drama, and
art.

This week, however, the most
active part of this hub (the Vagabonds)
was threatened with extinction. The
immediate reasons were overwork and
lack of full cooperation on the part of
the administration. The underlying
problem, as we see it, is that the Hill
(and we dare say the student body) has
simply not fully appreciated the place
of'a dynamic fine arts program at
Davidson.

A question occurs to us—one that
was asked when the Fine Arts Center
was first dedicated—what is the build-
ing there for? Is it to insure that the
fine arts will play an integral role in
the liberal arts curriculum? Or is it to
impress travelling philanthrophists
with our Captured Culture? As if
buildings alone can turn out the
“Compleat Man.”

Dr. W. F. Goodykoontz undertook
his program with the aim of involving
as many students as possible in the
dramatic arts. In this he supposed!
had the complete backing of the facul-
ty and administration. Certainly the
results have benefited all. Indeed we
would be willing to bet that drama has
provided the most important bridge

etween the college and the commun-

ity. But cooperation stayed mired in
the “frill” concept. The result was
frustration.

Another professor, Dr. Robert S.
Lord, had a similar aim. He wanted to
make music an integral part of the
curriculum and he was well on his
way toward the goal. He ran into prob-
lems of a similar nature. We can only
speculate what part, however minor,
they played in his decision to leave.
We wonder if every means was ex-
hausted to keep him here.

At any rate we are glad to see the
immediate crisis resolved. We hope
that Don Stowell will consider with-
drawing his resignation or taking only
temporary leave.

The Vagabonds have survived
and now lead a steady, perhaps pre-
carious, existence. With that existence
we see the future hope of all the arts
at Davidson in the balance.

If this situation accomplished
anything, we hope it did more than
just cut a few more strands of red
tape.

Patriotism In The Narrow Sense

Two weeks ago the suave, sophis-
ticated world lost its composure and
screamed. The “Cuban Crisis” was not
merely a catchy title for a minor di-
plomatic fray. But rather, for the first
time in two decades, nations exper-
ienced an immediate fear of world-
wide annihilation in a war that would
have begun and ended with the press-
ing of a button.

Out of the war scare erupted a
surge of nationalism in the U. S. The
new spirit made strange bed-fellows.
As the war-machine patrolled the
beaches of Key West, Democrats and
Republicans alike fed fuel to the idling
motor.

Now that we can sit back and
loosen our black ties, remove our
Spiffies and unlace our combat boots,
perhaps the time is ripe for an exam-
ination of .our conduct while the na-
tional finger was on the button.

True patriotism is exemplified by
the’actions of those who fight for the
principles embodied in the U. S. Con-
Stitution. For it is’ a set of national
principles which provide for and allow
dissent. There were many people who
disagreed with JFK’s handling of the
Cuban situation, but were they any
less patriotic? It is the right of every
citizen to peacefully protest the ac-
tions of the federal government. To
deny this right must be construed as
an unpatriotic act.

Nowhere does the Constitution
state that citizens must follow un-
questioningly the principles of the
federal government. Belief in basic
doctrines is not an acceptance of
practical interpretations of them.

Many of Davidson’s Richardson
Scholars are from countries where
communists and other leftist groups
hold substantial representation in the
central government. On several oc-
casions these students expressed their
personal views concerning U. S. policy
in Latin America and were unneces-
sarily humiliated in return for their

honest candidness. Such labels as
“communist” and “anti-American”
smack of Birchism and have no place
in an academic community.

If we deny inalienable rights as
freedom of public assembly or free-
dom of speech, we are presupposing
that Man is unable to differentiate
between right and wrong. We are
making unilateral decisions which
effect others, yet we are denying
them an equal voice in deciding their
destiny.

Can we be so naive as to believe
that all the good guys wear white hats
and all the outlaws, black ones? Surely
an objective examination will not
show that good and evil have reached
a stage of telophase, separating com-
pletely, and isolating themselves on
opposite sides of the world. "

The Community Party, U. S. has
offered to send speakers to Davidson.
The administration has said “this
wouldn't be wise.” Are our thought
processes such that we would be
pushed across to the left arm of the
balance?

Without consideration of the ac-

tual issues we condemn dissenters,

merely because their ideas do not
coincide with the will of the majority.

As soon as we stop thinking, we
lose any leadership abilities we may
have had previously. We become blind
followers whose main object in life is
to stand-fast in the security provided
by the crowd around us. ;

Wolves run in packs. Bees live in
swarms. There can only be one leader,
for as soon as a new queen-bee is born
She is killed to prevent dissention in
the hive. Freedom to dissent implies
freedom of choice, and in this ability
of Man to choose, select and sort-out,
lies his inherent supremacy.

_To respect this freedom is to rec-
ognize the true worth of democracy,
and such an espousal to the ideals of
democracy is patriotism in the broad
sense.

Freedom Of Collegiate Press
Discussed At ACP Conference

BY DAVE STITT
Davidsonian Managing Editor

The topic that dominated con-
versation at the Associated Col-
legiate Press Conference two
weeks ago was the recent decis-
ion of the president of the Uni-
versity of Colorado to fire the
editor of the school’s newspaper.

The conference, which was
held in Detroit, was highlighted
by two open panel discussions
on the “Freedom of the College
Press,” each of which dealt with
the incident at Colorado and
other similar cases.

The rather unwise action by

LETTERS TO

the editor of the University of
Colorado newspaper that led
to his being fired was his al-
lowing an article to be pub-
lished which called Senetor
Barry Goldwater (in context)
a “murderer and @ mounte-
bank.” The article contained
similer sentiments about for-
mer President Eisenhower.
The article naturally raised a
great deal of controversy, and
the university’s president decid-
ed to fire the editor for allow-
ing what he called “libelous ac-
cusations” to be printed. This
action came despite the fact that

THE EDITOR

McCutchen: ’’True Worship
Depends Upon Individual”

McCutchen

Dear Editor:

While the present criticism
of required chapel anc yespers
is welcome in that it shows a
genuine desire for a relevant
religion by Davidson students.
THE DAVIDSONIAN editorials
have failed to consider two im-
portant aspects of the situation.

First, definite action has been
taken to improve the effective-
ness of Thursday chape!. Before
the first editorial in the current
series on religion at Davidson
had been published, the Relig-
ious Life Committee of the
YMCA had made specific plans
for changes in this service
which will be evident before the
end of this semester, negating
retroactively the validity of the
dubious cry that no organiza-
tion on campus has acted.

Second, better speakers and
more attractive orders of serv-
ice, as advocated by THE
DAVIDSONIAN, will do little
good unless the individual
students make a sincere ef-
fort to derive personal mean-
ing from the services, mean-
ing which ean be found even
in the present Thursday
chapel if the individual reilly
desires to find it and seeks it.
This meaning or relevance is
not something which the Dav-
idson student has a right to

expect the college to produce
for him as a matter of course.

By all means, constructive
changes should be made in the
externals of these services, for
better programs will be more
relevant and their relevance will
be more easily seen. But wheth-
er or not there will be true wor-
ship at Davidson depends es-
sentially on the attitude of those
worshipping.

Dear Editor:

“My soul cries out to Thee, oh
Lord.” These decply felt words
began the prayer in last Thurs-
day’s chapel by Dr. Dan Rhodes.
They stuck in my mind: and as
I repeated them—though it may
have been merely my imagina-
tion—it seemed that every stud-
ent was whispering these words
to himself, too. “Two good
chapels in a row... I can't
believe it,” I thought. “Dr.
Workman last week and now Dr.
Rhodes.”

But these were more then
just good chapels to be shak-
en off as we left Chambers
auditorium; both communicat-
ed something to me about
why we are here. Dr. Work-
man, two weeks ago, said thet
&@ professor's purpose wasn’t
to tell us students what to
think, but rather to try to
tell us what he himself thinks.
it’s up to the student to
think out for himself what he
can believe and what he can’t.

It occurred to me both times
that Dr. Workman and Dr.
Rhodes were expressing them-
selves sincerely, throwing out
their ideas for me to grapple
with. Neither was telling me
anything I should think.

Then the essence of education
must be to think about what
we've heard and seen, and then
to be able to decide what we
think ourselves. What education
is not is indoctrination of what
we should think—especially in
celigion, of what we should be-
lieve, as good....

PRANUTS

council, faculty council on stud-
ent affairs, university board of
regents, and the Colorado state
legislature had all refused to
censor the editor’s action.

Two well-meaning girls at the
ACP conference typed up a
petition demanding that the
Colorado school president either
reinstate the editor or take the
libel charges to court, and 30 to
40 sympathetic newspaper edi-
tors signed it.

But then somebody happened
to ask some of the Colorado
delegation to the conference if
they wanted the editor back,
and as the answer was a unani-
mous negative, the whole idea
was dropped. Apparently the
Colorado student body didn't
want him back either, because
last week a student council
referendum asking for rein-
statement of the editor was vot-
ed down two to one by the stud-
ents.

However, many other con-
ference delegates brought up
cases of suppression of their
own college newspapers by
administrations. Two news-
pepers had been suppressed
entirely and told to shut down
operation, and others were
censored weekly by their dean
of students.

The Davidson delegation
found much to be. thankful for,
as time after time editors of
newspapers in smal] Southern
schools, especially church-re-
lated ones, stood up to relate
incidents where college admin-
istrations had interfered with
and suppressed their publica-
tions. Often expulsion from
school was the penalty for print-
ing an article favoring integra-
tion or criticizing the school’s
policies.

Classes at the conference
were led by student delegates,
and included courses on year-
book and magazine publication,
.& basic newspaper course, and a
series of talks for business man-
agers,

Carrell:
Distorts

BY DANNY CARRELL

Student Body President
Although I am a firm believer
in editorial freedom, I also be-
lieve that editorials and news
articles should be accurate when
dealing with fact rather than
opinion. An article and two edi-
torials in past issues of THE
DAVIDSONIAN have been dis-
torted enough to convey the
wrong impression to the read-

YA ers.

In THE DAVIDSONIAN of

4 Oct. 19th, a story was headlin-

ed, “Council Quietly Joins NSA
Confederation.” This article re-
ported that the Student Council
had voted to become perman-
ently affiliated with the NSA. In
the next issue, an editorial
criticized the Council for having
“backed into” the National
Student Association.

At its meeting on Oct. 15th,
the Student Council neither
joined the NSA mor did ft
vote in favor of permanent
affiliation. It became e mem-
ber of NSA in the spring of.
1961. This year it merely ap
proved the payment of the 30
dollars dues for the ‘62.63
year. in effect, it voted to re
tain membership. Membership
is no? permanent because any
future Council has the right
to disepprove of paying the
annual dues in order to ter
minate membership.

I cannot see why the Council
was accused of “backing into”
the NSA. It has been a mem-
ber for over a year, and Coun-
cil representatives have had am-
ple time to take a close look at
the organization. Last August,
John Spratt and I both took ten
days from a busy summer to at-
tend the National Student Con-
gress. We decided that it was
definitely to Davidson's advan-
tage to retain membership in
the National Student Associa-
tion. The fact that there was
little discussion on the matter
shows that the Council members
were unanimously willing to ac-
cept the recommendations of-
fered to them.

It is true that little has been

“Paper
Facts"

said to the student body about
NSA. We have remained silent
because we have been waiting
to hear from the National Of-
fice on actions taken by the
Post-Congress National Execu-
tive Committee. We are expect-
ing such information within the
next two weeks. Therefore, next
week’s DAVIDSONIAN will car-
ry the first of a lengthy series
of articles on the National Stud-
ent Association.

During the second semester,
there will probably be one or
fwo assembly programs con-
nected with the NSA. We also
plen to utilize oe bulletin
board, publicize NSA projects
and conferences, and make
available to the students pub-
lleations which we receive as
a result of being on the NSA
mailing list.

I also want to clarify last
week's editorial concerning the
drinking rule. The Student
Council considers the after-
dance parties as being under the
jurisdiction of the off-campus
drinking rule. Presently, the
faculty is not enforcing the rule
because the College is not
financially sponsoring these
parties. Interpretation of the
rule is subject to change, how-
ever.

The point I wish to make is
that the Council is not consid-
ering an isolated case of off.
campus drinking, but is con-
cerned with the entire question
of off-campus drinking. Our
first step will be to discuss the
matter with the Faculty Com-
mittee on Social Life in order
to hear the faculty’s point of
view and to present the stud-
ents’ point of view.

(Editor’s Note: 1. While this
year’s membership in NSA is not
“permanent,” last year’s mem-
bership was passive and was re-
peatedly acknowledged as only
a “triel membership.” 2. Little
discussion indeed means accep-
tance. But, on the whole, was it
enlightened or ignorant accep-
tance? Can passive acceptance
turn into active existence? Let's
hope so.)

Brecht Entertains
With Instruction

BY DUDLEY SALLEY
Davidsonian Steff Writer

The term Verfremdung, as chic a Teutonic neologism
today among critics and pseudo-liberal artists as
‘Geworfenheit once was, is more widely known than any
other of Bertolt Brecht’s inventions, excluding the song
“Mac the Knife;” and it has confused countless readers
who have never heard of Brecht, much less seen any of

his plays.

The term refers to critical detachment of the
audience. This detachment is lost so long as spectators
identify themselves with the characters on stage, as in
the conventional theatre of illusion, which he described
as having sunk to the level of “a branch of the bourgeois

drug traffic.”
Such an identifying

audience may leave the

theatre entertained through an emotional catharsis,
but it will have remained uninstructed and unim-
proved. The entertainment offered by Brecht’s
theatre is rather the pleasure felt when we discover
new truths, the exhilaration experienced when we
enlarge our understanding.

It is the pleasure afforded that audience which forms
even when attendance is not required. And it is this
same urge for knowledge, the most rational aspect of
human endeavor, that Brecht shows in Galileo to be
merely another of man’s instincts, as deeply irrational
as the instinct for procreation.

The play is mature Brecht. It is an epic of an un-
heroic hero, who as a person is unimportant—he does
not even appear in the last scenes. Galileo is no martyr.
To indulge his sensual pleasure of discovery, he is pre-
pared. to commit the meanest action; he re¢ants his
theories and establishes the tradition of the scientist’s

subservience to the state.

Galileo’s is the original sin of modern science.

The greatest of inteflects, the

ersonification of

science itself, is ruined by his inability to overcome
the base, instinctive side of human nature. The
atomic bomb as a social as well as a technical phe-
nomenon is the classical end product of his scientific
accomplishment and his social failure.

Brecht has used the figure of Galileo to pose two
questions of the Twentieth Century: the question of
scientific progress and social morality, and the questien
of how to employ acknowledged truth under a controlling
power which sees this truth as a threat to its control. Both
questions coincide in the problem of moderate, ac-
knowledged progress as against social revolution. The
one without the other, Brecht proposes, must bring

society to its destruction.

“Should you then, in time, discover all there is to
be discovered ” says Galileo, “your progress must then
0

become a progress away from the bu

humanity. The

gulf might even grow so wide that the sound of your
cheering at some new achievement would be echoed by

a universal how! of horror.”
