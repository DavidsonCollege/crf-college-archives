Spike in faculty departures raises questions

By Mike ANDERSON
Editor-in-Chief

Over recent months, some longtime fac-
ulty members at Davidson have noticed what
they describe as a disturbing trend: it seems
that more and more highly-respected profes-
sors are trading their teaching posts for greener
pastures in other academic institutions or the
private sector.

Five respected Davidson faculty mem-
bers tendered their resignation over the course
of the 1999-2000 school year.

Some alarmed faculty have dubbed the
recent surge a “brain drain,” warning that
these departures reflects systemic shortcom-

Nonetheless, the Vice President for Aca-
demic Affairs acknowledges that “We have
to be vigilant with respect to the situation, we
have to look carefully at the causes of faculty
departures, and we need to assess our policies
when appropriate.”

Oh, the places they’ll go.

Those that are concerned point not only
to the sheer number of professors departing,
but to the high quality of those taking flight.

“The people that have been leaving were
all excellent teachers and professionals,” says
Ross.

However, Dr. Clark Ross (Dean of the

this year’s departure rate could be viewed as
well within the natural ebb and flow of the job
market. And an overwhelming majority of

“In a . society
where experts suggest
that a professional will
have an average of
three to four careers or jobs during a work
lifetime, we should expect that Davidson,
like all colleges, will have some turnover,”
says Ross. “To date, our turnover is relatively
small at the faculty level.”

According to Ross, Davidson has “‘lost”’
eight professors over the past three years (not
counting those that retired or were not offered
continuing positions)—-an average annual
retention rate of some 98 percent.

Most all of them explained that “opportuni-

City University of New York beginning this
fall. “Davidson has an amazing faculty and
the best college students in the country. At
the same time, Hunter presented me with an
extraordinary professional opportunity, along
with the chance to work and live in an urban
environment.”

Dr. Shelley Rigger, a prominent expert
on East Asian politics who was nearly plucked
away by an offer from Georgia State Univer-
sity this spring, echoed those sentiments.
“Davidson is great, the idea of leaving was
really painful,” she says. Rigger had consid-
ered the move after her husband was offered
an attractive position in the Atlanta area, but
the tandem opted to stay near Davidson when
he found a comparable offer in Charlotte.

“The quality of faculty at Davidson re-
mains absolutely excellent,’ beams: Ross.
‘And I personally feel that the faculty is very
supportive of the-institution-and very sup-
portive of its students.”

cording toa report from the college’s Profes-
sional Affairs Committee.

The college’s leadership took this dis-
crepancy to heart and embarked on an aggres-
sive program of fortifying faculty compensa-
tion packages. The Board offered healthy
raises to all returning faculty in each of the
past two years. For the upcoming school
year: full professors will earn an average of
6.0% more, while associates will bring in
8.3% more and assistants will garner a 9.8%
raise.

“The administration has made some-very
serious efforts,” says Dr. Ken Menkhaus, a
political science professor serving on the
Professional Affairs Committee. ‘In the past
few years, salary increases have been quite
generous. We're starting to become more
competitive.”

Dr. Ross explained that faculty pay raises
are a high priority, but that salary alone has
not been the deciding factor in the loss of any
recent faculty members. “To‘date, I have not
