Paris, Texas journeys into the American psyche

By BROOKE KNIGHT

Nastassja Kinski is not con-
vincing as a Texan. That’s the
only major criticism that can be
said about Paris, Texas.

Despite the fact that Kinski’s
performance doesn’t make you

believe her character, the movie ~

succeeds. The action is centered
on Travis (played by Harry Dean
Stanton) and his slow assimilation
back into the real world he left
four years ago.

We see Travis walking alone
in the dessert of Texas looking for
water. He collapses and the shifty
doctor attending him calls Travis’
brother Walt, who thought he had
died years ago. We find out that
Travis’ son Hunter was left at
Walt’s doorstep by Jane (Kinski),
Travis’ wife. Some kind of major
trauma had blown this once-nu-
clear family apart. The story un-

Thierry Rousset (second from n left) demonstrates the finer points to Marlys

Batten, Ed Daugherty, and Mark Barrow

folds from there.

Travis is enigmatic: he cannot
even figure himself out at the be-
ginning. The knot of his character
is untied as the knot of the story is
untied. In the first part of the film,
his mind is as much a void as the
desert he © aimlessly . walks
through. He seems to have been
walking forever, and if it weren’t
for his brother, he would have
probably continued walking. He
is not going toward anywhere, just
away from somewhere.

The story ends in Houston,
epitome of order. By then, both
Travis and the audience has made
sense of what had gone on before.
‘Travis and his son travel to Hous-
h of Jane, (They find
her of course, but that is the only
predictable part of the film.) Find-

blocks, aiming at other players’
balls to knock them out of posi-
tion, and even trying to hit and
move the marker itself. “That’s
what makes this game so fun,”
says Rousset, “the picture is al-
ways changing.” Good positions
can become terrible with just one
toss.

Petanque is very popular on a
social level as well as on a com-
petitive one. According to Rous-
set, “More than 5 million families
play in France, especially in the
south.” The game is a favorite at
picnics, and appeals to all ages,
“Grandma and Grandpa as well
the children.” The leisurely pace
of the game allows. people time to
relax and socialize.

Thierry Rousset is presently
teaching a class of ten students
through the Davidson Athletic
Department. As Sudeep Sen put
it, “I never knew one could get PE
credit so easily!” Don’t be fooled,
however; it’s harder than it looks.

Rousset has also organized the
Spring Petanque Tournament for
staff, faculty, students, and inter-

‘over the “Computer Nerds.”

ested members of the community.
Response has been so overwhelm-
ing that he has divided the 23
teams registered into three
leagues: the Major, the National,
and the American  Petanque
leagues. Equipment for both the
PE and the tournament has been
donated by JB, one of the leading
manufacturers in France.

After one week of competi-
tion, the Admissions office team,
the “Fantom Fadams,” stand out
with their impressive 13-0 victory
Cap-
tain of the winning team, Gary
Mason, has already set his sights
on the championship. Roni Jen-
nings, also a member of the “Fan-
tom Fadams,” sums up the game
well. “It’s just a real fun thing to
do. It provides an opportunity to
socialize, as well as a great excuse
for being outside.”

Davidson is well on its. way to
developing the skills required for
the sport of petanque, though
there’s no question who holds the
true talent. As Thierry Rousset ap-
proached an afternoon.game, one
player appropriately remarked,

he eschewed four years ago. The
climax of the film comes when
Travis and Jane talk through the
one-way mirror intercom/tele-
phone system: they open up but
are still separated.

The whole movie, in fact, re-
volves around this separation/con-
nection relationship. Travis . is
separated from society totally;
Hunter is separated from his par-
ents; Jane is separated from her
husband and son. Who or what
caused this separation and how
things can or cannot be re-con-
nected are the central questions in
this mystery of the mind.

Secondary to the separation/
connection theme is a search for
origins: Paris, Texas is where
Travis thinks he was conceived
(he has actually bought a lot in
there); Hunter is willing to search
with Travis for his mother, from
whom he came.

Line. Movement. Rhythm.
The Joyce Trisler Danscompany
celebrated the possibilities of
dance Wednesday evening in
Love Auditorium as part of the
Davidson College Artists Series.
The New York company com-
bined classical and modern move-
ment in a stunning repertoire of
works choreographed by founder
Joyce Trisler and Australian Gray
Veredon and Sabatino Verlezza.

The company continues its
tradition of ballet-oriented dance
infused with the expressive torso
arid parallel stance of modern
dance. The first piece “Dance for
Six,” choreographed by Joyce
Trisler, is set to excerpts from
Vivaldi’s “La Centra.” The move-
ment is energetic and free-flow-
ing, each section emerging beauti-
fully from the one before it. A
duet explores the erotic relation-
ship of man to woman. The piece
returns again and again to care-
fully-placed frieze-like positions;
the dancers are viewed two-di-
mensionally .

The second piece “Journey”
features soloist Regina Larkin
dressed in a ghost-like white shift
that flows around her, highlight-
ing her movement and control.

The eerie score by Charles Ives
phantom-like

emphasizes _ the
quality of this piece also choreog-
raphed by Trisler. Larkin con-
veyed her haunting message with
trembling movement and fearful
gesture.

The third piece “Tobi Roppo”
premiered this year at Dartmouth
College. This rhythmic piece
choreographed by Sabatino Ver-
lezza takes its cue from Kabuki
theatre. “Tobi Roppo” literally
translated means “flying in six di-
rections.” The six dancers did in-
deed fly in all directions portray-

ing the necessary physical readi- .

ness to move in any direction.
Three: statuesque men followed
the lead of the satyr-like lead
dancer, while the women bent and
swayed to the rhythmic music.
The final piece “Koan” in-
volved all nine dancers focusing

The plot, the character de-
velopment, and the scene all mir-
ror one another to effectively. get
‘writer Sam Shepard's main
themes across. As the plot gains
structure, so do the characters and
the scene. The movie starts after
some horrendous crime has been
committed, from whence things
moved toward entropy. With a lit-
tle help from Walt, the structure in
all areas starts to form again, al-
though things will never be the
same as before the crime.

Technically, the movie is
superb. The cinematography and
direction of Wim Wenders espe-
cially deserve kudos. Colors ap-
pear brilliantly and intensely —
they entice and amaze the audi-
ence. Some shots would be con-
sidered great still photographs,
while others are able to sum up a
whole situation.

Dialogue is sparse but actually

says quite a bit. Wenders artfully
guides the actors and their as-
signed words into a fluid but slow
stream of action and speech, tak-
ing the viewer along with the char-
acters’ story. Wenders even over-
comes the fact’ the Kinski could
not have been the best choice for
the part of Jane.

Paris, Texas is a small and
slow film, but its pace and size are
an asset to the overall production.
It is intriguing and exciting on a
small scale. As a German/French
collaboration, it surprisingly
gives an accurate view of Ameri-
ca. However, the film is ambiti-
ous in a way American producers
and directors would never think
of. Four stars.

Paris, Texas can be seen
Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at
7 p.m. Both shows are in Love
Auditorium.

Danscompany: art art into movement

Trisler Danscompany visits from New York

on. the male-female partnerships.
The struggle between man and
woman was portrayed by the ero-
tic love-hate relationships danced
in “Koan.” A duet by, Regina Lar-
kin and Kevin Campbell finds the
female trying desperately to incite
the passions of her partner. The
rest of the company moves around
them in pairs only heightening her
frustration as the other couples,
seemingly fulfilled, taunt her. The
dominant male partner in each
couple bends and manipulates the
bodies of the female, taking con-
trol of the dance. Choreographed
by Australian expatriate Gray
Veredon, the piece ends in frustra-
tion for Larkin as her distant lover
leaves her writhing on the stage in
desperation.

Combining eroticism with
tension, the Danscompany holds
the audience in the palm of its out-
stretched hand. The broad move-

ment and bold gesture serve to .
‘ communicate the spirit of the

dancer. The John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts

ribes the Danscompany ex-
perience: “Every moment is a cel-
ebration of human beauty, giving
the company a classic timeless-

ness. Trisler’s choreography hon-
ors this beauty, but goes deeper;
she celebrates mind and heart, as
well.”

The company made its debut
in 1974 under the direction’ of
Joyce Trisler. New York Times
“critic Anna Kisselgoff wrote that
the premier performance “reaches
the level of the magnificent.”
After the death of Trisler of a heart
attack in 1979, dancer Miguel
Lopez served as acting artistic di-
rector until Milton Myers took
over in 1980. In 1986,*Miguel”
Lopez again took over the reigns
as artistic director. Lopez had
danced in the company since its
inception in 1974. Both men are
trained ‘in the tradition of Joyce
Trisler and are committed to keep-
ing her spirit infused in the
Danscompany.

The Danscompany celebra-
tion is over at Davidson, but as the
Joyce Trisler Danscompany tours
the United States, the celebration
will spread. The celebration of life
through dance so beautiful in this ’

_ shining example has left us with

our own celebration. to con-
