Anyone who will take the trouble to
read carefully the Senior Oration sub-
ject8 which appeared in last week's
DAVIDSONIAN cannot help being struck
by the fact that they are so wide in
scope. At best fourteen of them deal
with world issues and international
questions, while many others border on
the same line of thought. Furthermore,
this number has gradually increased year
by year. This is not a coincidence, it
points to a fact. The mind of the mod-
ern, educated, thoughtful man is turn-
ing away from the “ego” to the “frater.”
Students are coming more and more to
realize that at the present day, the great
life is not only one of service, but one
of world service. That such a spirit is
growing is shown by the fact that the
number of volunteers to the foreign mis-
sionary field has steadily increased, that
$150,000 is being raised by students of
America for war prisoners in Europe,
by the formation of Polity clubs, and
other things. And this spirit should
rightly increase. The time will soon
come when not only Woodrow Wilson,
John R. Mott and a few: others, will
be known as “world citizens,” but every
man who wishes to be a leader. And
college students, the leaders of the next
generation, cannot realize this too
acutely.

As Senior Speaking is beginning to
loom upon the horizon of the students’
thoughts, and the. writing of orations
becomes no longer an anticipation but a
grim reality, it is to be hoped that Sen-
iors will profit by last year’s experience,
and begin to learn their speeches soon
enough. Nothing so embarrasses a
speaker or audience, or so detracts from
the interest and pep of a speech, as not
knowing it well. Several of last year’s
Juniors had ‘never once recited their
orations perfectly before they arose up-
on the dreaded occasion when memory
‘tends to flit away. May no speaker have
to refer to his paper, or even stop to
recall, this year.

MR. ERWIN SPEAKS AT
Y. M. C. A. MEETING

Men’s Clothes.

At the regular weekly meeting of the
Y. M. C. A. on Thursday night, Rev.
Mr. Erwin, pastor of the local Method-
ist church, was the speaker. Mr. Er-
win chose as his subject “The How of
Prayer,” pointing out the way in which
prayer should be made in order that it
be effective. The first point empha-
sized was humility, the attitude in which
we should come to God, asking Him for
forgiveness for sin. Next comes faith
that God is able and willing to hear and
give what is best for us, altho that best
may not seem to us to be the thing which
we have desired. Thankfulness to God
for the blessings that we enjoy and for
God's treatment of us was also given
as an essential of prayer. Still another
point was that there must be an honest
purpose in prayer in order that it may
be heard. In closing, the speaker ap-
pealed te his audience for a greater at-
