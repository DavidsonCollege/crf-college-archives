Where The

The spectacle of hundreds of girls
at Davidson for Homecoming, distract-
ing as-it is, brings to mind one girl’s
reaction to a Davidson weekend. as
recorded two years ago in the Win-
ston-Salem Journal.

The Journal was taking a poll on
“where the boys are” and how the
girls who dated there rated the guys.
As we recall it, we fared pretty well
in the overall survey, but this one
girl—a Carolina coed—had a particu-
larly perceptive bit of analysis.

“Dating on campus for a big week-
end there,” she said. “is like going
out of a quiet room into a world of
hungry people just. released from
Strict. diets—a definite frantic effort
to raise hell and get their money's
worth.”

She’s right, you know. We are hun-
gry—for fun, for companionship. for
a little reality .. . for a lot of things.
And what we need is a steady diet of
girls, not just weekend samples.

Coeducation is the thing now—
everybody's doing it.

For instance, Sewanee—which
hurts for girls worse than we do—is
admitting 50 of them next year.
Lafayette’s going coed, and Princeton

Girls Aren’t

appears on the verge of doing the
same.

Even Vassar, that bastion of fem-
ininity, is doing it. She shafted Yale
last fall, to be sure, but she’s back on
the prowl again, casting coy glances at
Williams and Wesleyan.

There’s hope for us, too.

For years Davidson officialdom has
pooh-poohed the idea of coeds here,
but recently girl-talk has become
more fashionable. In fact, in a col-
lege publication no less official than
the booklet detailing the needs for the
new library, the possibility of David-
son coeds is cited right there on page
one.

Davidson needs girls. Academically,
they would contribute new viewpoints
and -new competition. And socially,
... Well. we need to learn to judge a
girl on criteria other than the coior
of her dress, the length of her hair,
and how much she puts out.

A coed set-up would be ideal, but
if that is not feasible, we'll settle for
a coordinate campus. The recent re-
mark by a Vassar official that a co-
ordinate system would probably be-
come a “cold system” leaves us un-
daunted.

We'd like to try it anyway.

The Library (Cont'd)

The ink on last week’s editorial
column had hardly had time to dry
before a couple of concerned readers
pounced -on us with postscripts to our
comments on the site of the new
library.

One was a student who helped count
the ballots in the student poll on ‘pro-
posed locations two years back, and
he reprimanded us gently for mis- ,
reading the results. .

“You make it sound like the Lingle
Manor site was one of the choices the
Students could vote on,” he said,
“when in a way it wasn’t.

“The ballot had sketches of three
sites—in front of Cannon and East
dorms, across Concord Road, and in
front of Little—but Lingle Manor was
only one of several ‘other suggested’
locations at the bottom of the page.
The make-up of the ballot itself
might've influenced a lot of students
to overlook the Lingle Manor site, and
you should apologize for not pointing
this out.”

We apologize.

The other. comment came from a
professor, and it constitutes another
reason why the library shouldn’t—or
should—be located at the manor site,
depending on how you look at it.

“This whole business of using a
possible coordinate girls’ campus to
the north to justify a Lingle Manor
site just doesn’t make sense,” he said.
He pointed out that a lot of the land
along State Road 115 is not owned by
the college—contrary to popular be-
lief—and ‘we probably: wouldn't want
to put a girls’ campus so close to the
Toad anyway.”

The college-owned property, he
said, is actually that beyond the Beta
and Sigma Chi houses, where a lot of
the intramural fields are, and “if we
put the other campus there, then all
the girls would have to walk. through
the fraternity court every time they
wanted to go to the library—and that’s
undesirable.”

Hmmm.

Feb. 12, 1965

I see when you arrive for the
weekend you are already tired from
your trip, but you are lovely. You
kiss me matter-of-factly, but there
is a promise in your eyes and a
smile that longs to be smiled alone.
At the dorm, Janie French will take
your three dollars and let us know
that she remembers that you have
been here with me before. She
smiles on lovers.

I will show you to my room, and
I am secretly proud when you tell
me that it looks nice. You will leave
Chanel on the pillow, and I will be
sad on Sunday.

In Rochester, there was a little

boy named Sammy. He was a
;. Negro. He would not speak, ex-

cept when he pulled on my sleeve
and said, “Got a nickel?” His
eyes were always half-blank,
half-questioning. | remember first
meeting him fighting with an-
other child. | pulled him away
and picked him up. All he did
was open his mouth as wide as
he could and utter a silent
scream.
{ carried him home on my
back, and he peed in his pants.
f On the front porch of his house,
his mother sat with her legs
spread while she cleaned the
meat out of the shell of a huge
turtle, The blood dripped off the
porch onto the dusty yard where
two near-naked urchins played
with another turtle shell. Sammy
was crazy.

At the dance, you will wear your

eyes and pass your lips—dquietly,
softly—across my chin. For a fleet-
ing second we are alone in the
crowd and I am fillea with wonder
and with love.

The newspapers are filled with
evidences of our guilt. Birming-
ham. Bull Conner & Co. pride
themselves on keeping order with
firehoses and cattle prodders.
Negroes are beaten, and the kian
cheers. And still they come.
“Keep your eyes on the prize,
hold on.” Philadelphia. The three
workers lie rotten in a shallow
grave—victims of fear and god-
less hatred. They will not be tried
for murder, not Rainey and Price.
“Life” runs a full-page photo of
smiling Sheriff Rainey, his mouth
full of “Red Man” chewing to-
bacco. Little Rock seems so far
away—a long, bloody way away.

“Ain't no black s.0.b. gonna
stink up my children’s school!”

“Kill ‘em! Kill ‘em!’

A single Negro looks into the
mad crowd of white faces that
are ugly with fear and hatred.
“NIGGER,” they scream. His
head bows. “NIGGER! NIGGER!
NIGGER!” .

They lay very still on the blan-
ket. In the distance they could hear
the gaiety and laughter of a party.
The moon’s hazy brilliance cast a
pale blue light. through thick pines,
interrupted only by an occasional
strand of silken cloud.

“It was wonderful.”

“Ves.”

“What are you thinking about?” }

“Nothing.”

“Tell me.”

“Nothing.”

“Are you thinking about love?”

“Yes.”

Ad Hoc Committee Blasts ROTC;
Conscientious Objector Differs

To The Editor:

We, the undersigned mem
bers of the Ad Hoc Com-
mittee for Voluntary ROTC
staged last Tuesday a de-
monstration to call attention
to our conviction that ROTC
should be made voluntary at
Davidson, voluntary in the
true sense that those who
wish to take it can, not that
those who do not wish to take
it must run a series of hurd.
les which include persuad-
ing one’s parents that they
“object” to one’s taking
ROTC.

In support of our convic-
tion. we call attention to the
following:

(1) The faculty has on sep-
arate occasions indicated its
conviction that ROTC should
be made fully voluntary.

(2) The visiting commit-
tee at the time of our re-
accreditation, a group of un-
biased observers. made the
Same recommendation.

(3) The Blue Sky Commit.
tee, the report of which has
supposedly been implement-
ed, made this recommenda.
tion.

(4) The question of the
morality of the military .is
open enough that a college
which purports to be Chris-
tian should not force even
one facet of this decision on
to its students.

(5) The call for voluntary
ROTC is not identical with
the call for its banishment
from campus (although this
call is also voiced by a mi-
nority of the Ad Hec Com.
mittee’s membership). It has
yet to be demonstrated that
the ROTC program would
not survive on a purely vol-
untary basis.

(6) Even if it followed that
mandatory ROTC (more or
less the present system) is
necessary for the ROTC pro-
gram’'s existence, is it fair
and just to require it of a
large number of students
who at the very least are
unenthusiastic and possibly
even find it morally distaste-
ful. for the sake of those
students who wish to have it?

(7) It is inconsistent with
Davidson's dual goals of ac-
ademic excellence and the
education of the whole man
to require of students even
the smallest amount of time
for a program that does not
supplement these goals. We.
find the argument that ROTC
teaches leadership is hollow.
in the face of the fact that
the first two years. the re.
quired portion, teach only
following and obedience.
Time spent on map-reading
and taking apart an M.-1 rifle
can surely be spent in a more
worthwhile manner.

We feel that the above ar-
guments are more than suf-
ficiently persuasive. We call
on the student body to sup-
port us, on the faculty to
insist upon its own express-
ed wishes, on the administra.
tion to listen to reason in the

voice of the faculty and on
the trustees to listen, reflect
and act. Negotiation on the
términation of Davidson's
ROTC contract with the U.S.
government should begin
now.

To The Editor:

In light of the ‘‘mandatory
ROTC” protest today, with
its meager display of op-
position (in which I did not
participate), I would like to
voice my opinion of the pre-
sent ROTC system.

Being a C.O., I was ex-
empted from ROTC as were
other students who for var-
ious reasons chose not to
participate in ROTC and

brought with them to David-
son requests for excusal
signed by their parents. I
believe that the present sys-
tem is generally good, in
that any student who has a
strong desire not to partici-
pate in ROTC can demon.
strate this desire to his par-
ents, who will usually honor |
his convictions and furnish
the required letter.

This system, however,
overlooks the one remaining
case—the student who has
strong personal objections to
the regimentation, conform-
ity, and time demanded by
ROTC, and whose parents,
in an attempt to discipline
an “unruly” son, refuse to
write the required request
for excusal from ROTC.

In this case, the forced ex.
ternal conformity can only
cause bitterness and rebell-
ion. as well as strain fur-
ther -the already troubled
parent-child relationship, ex-
amples of which 1 have al-
ready witnessed.

Nonetheless, I believe it
would be better for the stu-
dents involved to be given
the option of taking ROTC
as non-credit, non-academic.
course, and thus remedying
this as well as other more
apparent ills of the present
system, rather than turn out
even one of these bitter, and
therefore ‘‘not-so-well-round-
ed’, Davidson Gentlemen.

Stephen Salyer Praises Humphrey,
Attacks Liberals For Non-Support

To The Editor:

It is understandable that
those who supported candi-
dates other than Mr. Hum-
phrey in the earlier portions
of the campaign, specifically
on the Vietnamese peace is-
sue, should be concerned and
angry that none of the three
candidates appears to rep
resent an absolute opposition
to the war.

It would follow that this
same group should be hos-
tile to the efforts of the vice-
president during the cam-
paign.

But for all the logicality of
this position, is it realis.
tic for these same persons
to continue their opposition
and help elect the man liber-
als in both parties have
fought.for years: Richard M.
Nixon? I think not.

Closely associated with Mr.
Humphrey has been the word
inconsistent." Repeatedly
he has been viciously assail-
ed for failure to disassociate
himself with the Johnson ad-
ministration’s Vietnamese
policy.

Mr. Humphrey is the only
candidate, however, with any
possible justification for a
