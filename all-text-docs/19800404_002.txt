Corporate Programs in the

contributions.’ In simple
terms, he added, he aims a
securing “‘big bucks from big
companies and little bucks from
little companies’’ for David-
son’s Living Endowment fund.

~ Although inflation has affect-.
ed fundraising, Daisley does not

think the Living Endowment
corporate fund is in trouble.

Last year, he pointed out,
‘despite the vacancy in the
position of Director, $105,000 of
the $631,000 raised for Living
Endowment from corporations.

‘The $35 million dollar goal of —

the 1987 Program, Davidson's
11-year fundraising effort, is

outdated, Daisley said. ‘‘We

realize we may have to revise
upwards. We are by no means
limiting ourselves to a certain

amount. We want as much as:

we can raise for the school.”
According to projections,

10% of the $35 million should

come from corporations. Last

year corporate giving amounted |

to $330,000. Daisley said that
since he has just assumed his
position he is ‘‘not sure’’ whe-
ther corporate gifts have been
up to 10%.

“Inflation and skyrocketing
building costs” have increased
Davidson's need for corporate
support, Daisley said, but “‘cor-
porations are beginning to
understand their obligation to
private education.”” He thinks
industrial growth in the South
should encourage corporate giv-
ing to Davidson. ‘‘As the
Sunbelt grows, Davidson
should be known as the finest
small liberal atrs college in the
South and a good source of
future business leadership. *
