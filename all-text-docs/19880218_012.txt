The undefeated season is not obsolete

By CHRIS HUGHES

When asked about Indiana,
most college basketball fans
would immediately think of last
year’s national champion Hoo-
siers. Some who have been
around a bit longer would also
think of the 1981 team with Isaiah
Thomas that took the title.

However, there have been three
title teams at IU under coach Bob
Knight. The least remembered
would be the 1976 champions,
perhaps the greatest team of the
past twenty years.

What is significant about that
bunch of Hoosiers is that they won
the championship with a spotless
32-Orecord. In the eleven seasons
since, no team has been able to
accomplish this feat. The fact is,
clearing the plate in college bas-

ketball in the 1980s is an impos-
sible dream.

It almost seems as if it is even
impossible to go unbeaten within
agivenconference. Take the case
of Arizona. The Wildcats are a
certified top five team in a confer-
ence which probably lacks an-
other team in the top forty.

However, Arizona went to
Stanford this past weekend and
fell to the second place team in the
Pac 10.

Likewise, we can look at
UNLV. TheRebsarecertainly the
class of their league but have lost
twice to Cal-Santa Barbara. At
this writing, there are only three
major teams still unbeaten in their
conferences: Temple, BYU, and
Kansas State. We can reasonably
expect that these teams will lose

somewhere along the line.

There are several factors that
make the undefeated season obso-
lete:

1. Television - Television gets
blamed for most everything evil in
sports today so we may as well use
it here too. With the dawn of the
80s came an onslaught of TV
coverage in collegehoops.

The best high school players
can now sithome and watch teams
from all over the country play
rather than only seeing the big
names on Saturday afternoon. In
the past, a prep all-American
would have gone to Notre Dame
so the folks back home could
watch him play. Now, he could
just as easily go to Auburn or New
Mexico. This all leads to an
spreading of the talent among
more teams so there are fewer
unbeatable teams playing fewer
unbearable teams.

2. Wealth of talent - Basketball
has become a much more popular
game in the past decade. It has
spread to parts of the country
where football had reigned su-
preme. The fact that there are
simply more people interested in
the game, and therefore more tal-
ented players to go around.

As above, this can only mean
that the level of talent is equal on
a wider scale.

3. Rules - It almost seems as if
the NCAA knew what they were
doing for once. In 1973, freshmen
were made eligible to play varsity
ball, thus spreading out the talent
even more. In addition to this, the
NCAA reduced the number of
active scholarships a team may

technology.

have as well as the size of coach-

Not only does this keep teams
from stockpiling great players,
but it also decreases the amount of
money necessary toruna Division
I program, allowing more teams to
compete on a higher level.

4. Number of teams and number
of games - In 1976, there were 235
Division I teams each playing an
average of 26 games per season.
Last year there were 290 teams
playing 29.6 games per season.
With more teams out there and
longer seasons, it only makes
sense that it would be harder to
win all of those games.

5. Tournament play - Tied into
the fact that more games are being
played is the fact that these extra
games are usually in tournaments.
All but three conferences (the Big
Ten, Ivy, and AMCU) play post-
season conference tournaments.

So we are more than half way
through the season and the last of
the undefeated teams fell this past
weekend. So we won’t be adding
another name to the list of teams
that have gone without a loss. In
college hoops today, even the best
around have to take their lumps
before they can be crowned na-
tional champs.

BSC’s Cool Riou
wins title, 48-47

By MATT TERRELL
Another season of IMAC bas-

. ketball has drawn to a close and

the champions have been
crowned. If you think there was
parity in the college ranks, the
teams down in Johnston Gym
provided parity in the form of
close games throughout the rank-
ings. Exciting tournament action
took place in the Women’s, Men’s
B-League, and Men’s A-League
tourneys.

In the Women’s League tourna-

_ ment, the always powerful “Insa-

tiables” claimed yet another title
with a victory over the “Clueless
Freshmen” of 4th Rich.

The “Insatiables,” seeded first
in the pre-tournament rankings
after a strong undefeated regular
season, emerged from the
winner’s bracket after facing the
“Clueless Freshmen” to play in
the Championship game. The
Clueless Freshmen, seeded sec-
ond after an impressive unde-
feated regular season, suffered
their first loss to the Insatiables in
the tournament, only to come out
of the loser’s bracket forarematch
in the Championship.

The game saw an outsized but
not outhustled Clueless Freshmen
team shoot well, but the Insati-
ables played a solid game in both
shooting and rebounding, thus
claiming the league title with an
unblemished record. Congrats to
the Insatiables!

The Men’s B-League tourna-

"ment saw 32 teams trying for the

title under a single-elimination
system. The Championship game
between “Stop Whaaring” and
the “Mantools” was an exciting
matchup.

The Mantools of 4th Little
reached the title game after hand-
ing “Bobee Marlin’s Blank Shoot-
ers” a defeat in the semifinals.
Stop Whaaring reached the final

-game after squeaking out a tough-

one-point victory over “Cooter’s
Nest.”

In the final game Sep Whaar-
ing was without the services of
one of their players due to his
suspension. This player was
ejected from a game after striking
an opposing team’s player and
causing a cut requiring stitches.
Some form of probation has been

levied against this player for next
year. Despite the absence of this
player, Stop Whaaring claimed
the title with a seven-point victory
over the Mantools Tuesday night.
The game saw the eventual cham-
pions take a three-point lead late
inthe gameand hold on for victory
after insurance points in the form
of a three-pointer and a last-sec-
ond basket. Congratulations to
the champions.

Men’s A-League play came to
an exciting close Wednesday
night as “Cool Breeze” of BSC
defeated “King Cobra” of SAE
48-47 on a last second layup by
Mike Jones.

King Cobra held a slim 22-20
lead at the half, as both teams
played conservatively.

The second half was IMAC at
its best, as both teams traded bas-
kets for the first ten minutes. Then
King Cobra asserted its strength
and raced to a43-35 lead with 1:58
to go.

Then Darryl Bego took control
of the contest as he connected on
two quick three-pointers to cut the
lead down to three with fifty sec-
onds remaining.

Cool Breeze had to resort to
fouling at this point, and the tech-
nique paid off. With 30 seconds to
go Mike Friedlander missed the
front end of a one and one. Cool
Breeze got the rebound and re-
sponded with a basket with less
than 20 seconds left to cut the
deficit to one.

King Cobra again went to the
line and again came away empty.
However, an errant pass gave
possession back to King Cobra
with 9 ticks on the clock.

Tracy Hankins was fouled on
the inbounds play and went to the
stripe with a chance to pad the
lead. Hankins missed the frontend
and Charlie Showers hauled down
the rebound. He passed to Marcus
Allen, who in turn dribbled\o half
court with three seconds left. Al-
len appeared ready to uncork a
desperation shot when he spotted
a wide open Jones under the bas-
ee ;

Jones hauled in the pass and
calmly laid the ball off the glass as
the horn sounded to give Cool
Breeze the coveted champion-
ship.
