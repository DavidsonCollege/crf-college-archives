Some Observations

For the most part, the discussions between the
Black Student Coalition(BSC) and the Faculty
Executive Committee (FEC) have been restrained
and fairly objective. This is essential for any progress
to be made.

In addition to frank discussion, progress requires
that there be some actions taken. A debate may be
very helpful in understanding a problem, but talk
alone will not solve the grievances of the blacks. It is
clear that both blacks and the college have failed to
perform the work necessary to improve conditions.

In the past the college has promiised the blacks that
Davidson will hire some black professors, yet we
have none. Granted it is difficult to find first-rate
black professors who want to teach in lilly-white
Davidson. But at the same time we question whether
the faculty and the administration have made a
significant effort to recruit black faculty.

The blacks have demanded a better social life, but
have done little to help the union bring about such a
change. We find the blacks very vulnerable to
charges that they don’t take advantage of many of
black-related social and academic possibilities
already opentothem. .

The BSC this week expressed disappointment that
the FEC’s response was ‘‘vague and noncommital,"’
but we fail to see how the college could respond
otherwise. The college must make a commitment tu
the blacks and then actively seek to fulfill this
commitment. But to promise the blacks more than
the college can possibly deliver would be to insult the
intelligence of all of us.

The debate has taken place; now is the time for both
groups to work to relieve present conditions.

Serious Business

A blanket of silence prevails across campus as
students and faculty enter the final stage of the term's
intellectual inquiry. Such a state of seriousness
symbolizes academia with faculty giving their final
evaluation of student's work.

Students are free to take their exams anytime they
wish because we live under a system of honor which
depends on the honesty and integrity of the members
of this community. Unfortunately neither students
nor faculty regard the honor system with the
seriousness that they regard exams.

Despite pleas from the Faculty Executive
Committee (FEC) and the registrar, many faculty
members have not reiterated the importance of the
honor system to their students. They mention it in an
off-hand manner.

Students treat the system in a similar fashion,
many resenting the suggestion that the honor system
applies to them. Despite instructions from the honor
court that nothing is to be said about any exam until
the period is over, several consider themselves above
such restrictions.

Exams and the honor system go hand in hand.
Students and faculty cannot take exams seriously
without taking the honor system seriously as well.

A Bright Spot

As the fall term draws to a close, we find one bright
spot of activity amid a sea of non-functioning
committees and a lazy faculty and student body. APO
under the leadership of Chris Allison is trying to fulfill
its goal as a service organization.

Again this year they published the college
directory, and they sponsored a picnic this week for
the STEP program. Now they have embarked on a
more ambitious project, establishing a used book
store.

Once again this group has demonstrated that things
will not get done around here unless someone is
willing to put in the required hard work. We hope APO
will serve as an example to all faculty and student
organizations which for the most part have failed to
fulfill their responsibilities so far this year. We
applaud the vigor and motivation of this group of
students.

The Good, The Mad, And The Hungry

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

...YEAH, AND OF

THE TRICK,GENTLEMEN ,IS THAT
WE HAVE A NEW DEFINITION OF

“SERVICE!”

Spray-Painting Belk Yellow
Included In Dorm Demands

To the Editor:

I must confess that as I
parade into my room each day
(Belk 320) I am immediately
impressed by its elegance. My
room has pipes to do pull-ups,
the soap dishes are just right
and the mirror reflects my
image.

As a matter of fact. my room
last year had separate faucets
for the hot and cold water. Of
course now I'masophomore and
I don't enjoy this benefit but I
recognize the necessity of
making sacrifices.
Nevertheless the rooms have
white ceilings and green and
yellow walls.

The overhead light 1s often so
bright I have to whip out my
shades and the rooms are large
enough to have a dance. To top
it all off. my feather bed and
silk sheets are the ultimate in
comtort.

Yes, sometimes I am deeply
disturbed that the other sexes,
races, and ethnic groups are
being so dramatically deprived
here at Davidson.

To be perfectly honest. I can
only in good conscience request
that next year we be moved to
Little Dorm and permit the
coeds to benefit from the luxury
of third Belk.

Naturally this will require
certain subsidies on the part of
the administration to provide
funds for (a) removal of urinals
(b) adaptation of soap dish
height (c) removal of top shelf
and (d) shower curtains.

We request this’ with
reluctance and timidity but
with the clear conscience and a
big heart.

We would also like to
comment on_ the _- sound
perceptive administrative
financial aquisitions. With the
drastic increase in
oceanographic and lake studies,
Lake Norman should be
considered as an excellent
purchase. Naturally. the price
should not exceed $100,000 a
square knot.

In conclusion, we = are
submitting a set of proposals
which must be met if the college
expects any more white, male
students to be encouraged to
come here. We have only four
demands though because we
have itsoGOOD.

(1) Some of the taller students
have been complaining that the
toilets are too low. Some of the

shorter undergraduates insist
that the toilets are too high.
Adjustable toilet seats MUST be
provided.

(2) Removal of urinals which
spit back at you when you flush
them.

(3) The outside of Belk Dorm
snould be painted green and
vellow--like the inside.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

(4) A work-study exchange
program should be developed
with Charlotte Correctional
Institute and the North Carolina
State Penitentiary.

I realize this letter is
ridiculous, but isn't that the
trend?

Court Fine Policy,
Classics Column Hit

To the Editor:

The latest action of the
Patterson Court Council.
levying a fine of $100 on any
House where a_efreshman

pledges to a national fraternity,
is typical of a thwarted child
who tries to force his will on
those around him.

All frustrated people must
compel those outside their
personal setup to conform to
their own enforced level of
mediocrity.

Freshmen are to be allowed
no alternative. After all. what
Davidson freshman is capable
of relying onhisown judgement?
Everyone knows that when a
young man enters Davidson he
desperately needs his Mommy
to show him what is really best
for him. And the PCC has
decided to be a universal
mother.

Personally, I was a staunch
independent for three years.
and I did not approve of
fraternities. But last year I
started eating at Random
House ‘still an Inde), and I
came to like and appreciate the
people there.

But I will never be a
fraternity man; now the PCC is
going to fine me becuase I like
to eat with a group of people
who happen to belong to a
fraternity.

Ihave no part in the actions of
that fraternity: I am_ being
punished for associating with
the ‘‘wrong” people.

Apparently freedom of choice
is not to be allowed in the social
system at Davidson. All must
conform, individual rights have
no meaning in an antequated

“ivory tower.

Im glad I'm leaving betore
this college reverts totally to its
policy of mass conformity that |
once thought was a thing of the
past

Rick Levi ‘74
Davidson College

To The Editor:

It seems to me that Associate
Editor Robert Touchton's
“analysis” of the Spring
Seminar in Classics Abroad
(THE DAVIDSONIAN, Novem-
ber 17, 1972) raises the question
of the propriety of using
DAVIDSONIAN | editorial
privilege either as a means of
circulating course evaluations
or as an instrument for publicly
excoriating a professor with
whose pedagogical procedures
one may not agree.

Despite some specious con-
cessions, Mr. Touchton’s
ariticle has the character of
personal vendetta (by his own
admission it was timed to coin-
cide with the selection of this
year’s candidates for the
seminar).

It is regrettable that such an
expression was addressed to the
whole forum of DAVIDSONIAN
readers rather than to the
recognized hierarchy of appeals
for academic grievances.
especially at a time when many
are laboring to improve
student-faculty relations and to
enhance the role of students in
faculty evaluation
