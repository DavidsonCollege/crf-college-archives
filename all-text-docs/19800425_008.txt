Engineering job
market found

most lucrative

(CPS)—Graduates going into
the job market this spring will
be offered*higher starting salar-
ies than last year’s’ graduates,
but the salary increases are
‘probably worth less in real
dollars, according to a study by
the College Placement Council.

Average increases, the CPC
announced April 8, are nearly
nine percent, although the infla-
tion rate has been 18 percent.

The CPC ited the aver-
ages by stud the starting
salaries offered graduates be-
tween September 1, 1979 and
March 6, 1980.

According to the study, pet-
roleum engineering graduates
can expect starting salaries up
to $1979 per month.

Not surprisingly , engineers of
all types can command the
highest salaries. Mechanical en-
gineers were offered an average
of $1866 per month. Chemical
engineers got $1790 per month,
civil engineers $1524, and elec-
trical engineers with advanced
degrees $1852 per month.

The high starting salaries
have convinced many engineer-
ing undergraduates to take jobs
instead of going to graduate
school, a development that
cduses some engineering teach-
ers to worry about where the
next generation of professors
will coine from.

There was much excitement
last week as teams in softball
and volleyball went past the
mid-season marks on their sche-
dules. Softball was in full swing
with excellent weather making
for optimum playing conditi-
ons. Volleyball teams suffered
in 90 degree temperatures due
to a faulty heating system in
the gym. Nevertheless, all
games were completed as sche-
duled.

In softball, the number one
team, Jays Texaco, defeated
House of Steaks 16-2. Jim
James led the winners with
three homeruns and a double
and increased his RBI’s for the
season to a league leading 34.
Bill Dobbs pitched for Jay’s and
limited the struggling House of
Steaks team to only 3 hits.

On Wednesday On Deck

- squeezed by the DCFers 8-7 in a

game that went two extra
innings. With the game tied at
seven a piece in the bottom of
the ninth, Lloyd Thompson of
On Deck was walked by Sam
Turner after a 3-2 count. Sam
Kelley came to bat and arched a
fly ball over centerfielder Gor-
don Thatcher’s head for a
standup double with Thompson
being brought home for the
winning run. The game left On
Deck with an 8-1 record and a
tie for first place.

This year’s volleyball season
has been the most. competitive
ever. There. seems to be a
greater interest in U.S. volley-
ball in general with the ap-
proaching Summer Olympic
Games. Last week saw the top
two ranked teams in a head to
head confrontation.

Not Net played Bump and
Run in a battle of the unde-
feateds. The match went 3
games with Not Net coming
from behind 6-10 to take a 15-12
victory. Several key players
that should be noted for the
winners are Charlie Key, Tim-
othy Parker and Randy White-
sides. George Harden made an
excellent showing for the losers.

In other games We Spike
demolished Hard to Beat 15-2,
15-3 in a match that took only
fifteen minutes. Team captain
John Reynolds commented on
the winning effort, “It seems
that we are beginning to peak as
the tournament approaches.
The guys are setting the ball
better and our spikes are going
in.”

The women’s league saw no
major upsets with The Trees
remaining undefeated.
