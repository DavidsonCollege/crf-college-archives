Duncan Plans New Programs
To Rejuvenate Ailing YMCA

By BOB HOWELL
Asst. Managing Editor

There will be a new look to
the YMCA next year, in more
ways than one, says YMCA Pres-
ident Larry Duncan.

“Symbolic of the YMCA's
progressive look for next year
will be the acquisition of the
railroad depot,” said Duncan.
*‘We’ll be able to lease it from
Southern Railroad for $1 a year.
and we can make any renova-
tions we need to.

“This summer we'll move the
offices over there. and put in
imsulation and heating.” he add-
ed.

“This building will serve as a
youth center for white and black
children of the community. and
also for students at Davidson,”
Duncan explained.

“We'll have one large multi-
purpose room for dances. games
and movies,” he continued. “and
since this will be the center of
the STEP program. there will
be individual rooms for tutorial
purposes.

‘Besides fixing up the depot.
we have big plans for the YM-
CA itself next year.” Duncan
went on.

He said that during the fund
drive next vear. each contribu-
tor of $5 or more would be
granted a membership in the
YMCA, but noted that the most
important changes would be re-
visions of the YMCA’'s present
programs.

‘‘We’re organizing hall discus-
sions at the beginning of the
year for freshmen. with leaders
from the administration and
student body,’ Duncan stated.

“But the discussion program
will also be expanded into the
lounges of the upperclassmen
dorms and down onto Patterson
Court, after we get suggestions
from both students and faculty
om what they would like to talk
about,”’ he said.

“The Religious Life program
in the past has been geared to
freshmen,” Duncan continued,
“but next year we’re making a
big effort at reaching more stu-
dents.

“I think there’s a great need
for this. as evidenced by the
several groups in this direction
that ‘have formed on campus.”
he observed.

*‘We hope to bring these groups
together, not into one belief, but
in a common bond of worship
and service. with each retain-
ing its identity.”

Duncan also discussed the
Great Issues program. “Next
fall there will be a 3-day sym-
posium on the penal system in
this country. and we'll bring in
noted authorities on the sub-

“We'll then have similar one-
dav symposiums on other top-
ics jn the winter and spring,”
he added.

“The Draft Counseling pro-
gram has probably been our
most effective one this year,”
Duncan said. ‘‘and it’s being ex-
panded.

“We've gotten quite a bit of
new material on recent draft
laws, and we're having office
hours next year all during the
afternoon.”

Duncan expressed his inten-
tion to expand the STEP pro-
gram considerably. ‘‘This is our
biggest program, but in the past

hasn't gotten that much in
funds. This will definitely
change next year.

“The program of working with
the North Mecklenburg YMCA
will also be expanded,’”’ Duncan
stated. ‘“‘Until recently, their
program hasn't been very large,
but as they grow we'll have
more positions for swimming
instructors, and football and
basketball coaches to be work-
ing with them.

ed Duncan. ‘‘In ‘addition to the
Sunday school leaders we have
this year, we will organize three
teams to present programs: on
different types of church wor-
ship.”

Duncan pointed out that there

Scouts returning mext year to

Scouting program will remain
essentially as it is this year.

“We are also beginning a new
program next year.” Duncan
continued. ‘im the area of So-
cia! Life." He emphasized that
this program of the YMCA
would work in conjunction with
the Union and not in competi-
tion with it.

“I feel that the Union hasn’t
been able to provide ample so-
cial life this year, and the YM-
CA hopes to fill in a little of
this void,” he said.

Prospects Appear Dim For
Married Student Housing

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

There seems little possibility
that the problem of married
student housing will improve
in the near future.

According to President Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr., the reason
why there has been ‘no outside
interest in building a large hous-
ing facility was because ‘‘the
college has subsidized rents and
kept them low,” thus creating a
low-profit situation for private
investors.

Spencer did note, however,
that as of last year, the col-
lege began to raise the rent
mark to a standard level, thus
hoping to stimulate investor in-
terest in the coming years.

The main point Spencer stress-
ed was that ‘‘as long as the
rental market is not up to par,
mvestors are not going to come
in.”

As evidence, a private pro-
moter who had submitted a plan
to the town to build low cost
housing, mostly for industrial
workers in the area, recently
withdrew his proposal.

As for the idea that the col-
lege itself build a low cost hous-
ing block for married students,
Vice President for Finance and
Development C. David Cornell
thinks that “‘it is not good for
the college to invest in this type
of program unless it is ground-
ed to something of value.”

For Cornell, the married stu-
dent thousing problem is one
simply of financial priorities,
“of only having so much money
and deciding where to put it.”

In this light, the college hasn’t
even recognized the married
students institutionally.

Both Spencer and Cornell ad-
mit that the housing problem
for this group is going to get
worse before it gets better, as
the number of married students
increases.

The only solution they see,
moreover, is in the progression

of the entire surrounding area
due to the projected finish of
I-77 in 1975.

By that time, they hope that
there will be enough interest by
outsiders to build a housing de-
velopment for both workers and
students as the North Mecklen-
burg County area expands.

Until something like this hap-
pens, little can be done to a!levi-
ate present conditions.

At present, there are close to
40 married student couples, and
only eight houses which the col-
lege supplies. The rest of the
couples are forced to find living
quarters in the surrounding
area, paying higher prices for
a limited amount of space. —

Surprisingly enough, the cou-
ples living in college supplied
quarters, such as the Jackson
Heights area behind Grey House,
are thankful for this type of low
rent (presently $44 per month)
housing, and like it.

- This is not to say that there
are not problems imherent in
these structures, however. They

were built before World War II
as only temporary housing fa-
cilities, yet have remained.

The walls, for example, are
made of poster board, so one
cannot wash them without their
crumbling. Storage space is al-
ways a problem in the limited
space available, and heating in
winter remains as a continual
source of trouble. —

Yet there are numerous ad-
vantages to the existing situa-
tion as defined by both Mrs.
Phillip Baldwin and her neigh-
bor, Mrs. Allen Tillman. They
both like the idea of living in
their own homes.

They further agree that the
college takes good care of main-
tenance around the houses. The
college cuts the lawn, fixes the
facilities very quickly after no-
tification, and even suppilies both
the stove and refrigerator.

Basically they both agree that
one could not find a better hous-
ing situation anywhere for the
money involved.

308 File Deposits

For Matriculation

By JOHN CASSELS
Staff Writer

Approximately 308 members
of the class of ’76 have filed
their $100 deposit with David-
son College.

The deadline for notification
by accepted applicants that they
intend to matriculate to David-
son was last Monday.

As of Wednesday afternoon,
Director of Admissions H. Ed-
munds White said that his office
had received tuition deposits
from 308 of the 571 applicants
accepted. -

There were about five special
cases in which the deposit was

in the mail at that time.

White said, ‘‘Because the per-
centage who acknowledged their
acceptances is larger than last
year, we have a few more fresh-
men than we had expected.”

White reported that 15 of the
30 finalists in Davidson Schol-
arship competition had decided
to matriculate. These prospec-
tive students had spent the
weekend of April 9-11 visiting
on the campus.

The Freshman Class will also
include 10 black students next
year. White said, ‘‘These are all
really fine students, and Lester
Strong has done a great job in
recruiting them,”
