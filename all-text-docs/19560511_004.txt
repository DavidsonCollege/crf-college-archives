DEBNAM’S BOOK TOPS

SOUTHERNERS READ
IN COLLEGE LIBRARY

The most widely read book in the College Library this

year was Debnani’s “Then My
Night.”

Statistics for the year’s circu-|
lation have just been compiled |
and of the voluntary reading the}
North Carolinian’s little booklet)
on the race question heads the list)
for Davidson’s student and faculty |
reading. This is perhaps surpris-
ing in view of the large number
of copies known to be personally
owned which provides a sort of|
dompetition with library eireula- |

|
'

tion.

The second title on the list is)
also short and readable: Armour’s|
“It All Started With Europa.”
Previous “best-circulators” have
included such lengthy pubes |
tions as the Kinsey reports, Walt-|
ari’s “The Egyptian” and Gun-|
ther’s “Inside U. S. A.” Armour'’s |
slight offering is a “spoof” at)
history and appears to be particu-

larly popular with the Faculty.
|

DOZEN FAVORITES ;
In the order of local popularity,
the dozen favorites for the cur-
rent year are as follows:
Debnam: “Then My
Home, Good Night!”
Armour: “It All Started With)
Europa.” }
