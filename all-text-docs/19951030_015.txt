The women’s soccer team was
unable to capture the regular sea-
son title this week for the second
time this year, tying Furman 2-2 on
Tuesday.

SOCCER

But the Wildcats (9-9-2 after
beating Georgia State 2-0 in
Sunday’s regular-season finale)

women ready for tournament

will put that past Gar: hebilihe
into this weekend’s Southern Con-
ference tournament hosted by
Davidson.

“We had to beat Furman to be
in the running for first in the con-
ference,” said Coach Hundley.

The team has been plagued
with injuries lately and as a result
played this week without its two
leading scorers. Lucia Plosser suf-
fers from a broken toe, and Heather
Wineberg has a ‘sprained knee.
Both Claudia Lombard and Amy
Kanoff have being playing with
ankle problems and Shannon

Lowrance played the last week with

a separated shoulder.

Friday, the Wildcats played
their final conference game and
defeated Appalachian State 2-1 de-
spite rain delays.

Davidson dominated the game
and the Mountaineers never threat-
ened in the second half. With a
change in the line-up, Kelly Amann
moved to forward and proved her-
self by scoring the team’s two goals.
The first was unassisted and the
second wasaheader off of Kanoff’s
corner kick.

“This was a good win. We
played and won against opposition
such as the rain and injured play-

ers,” said Coach Hundley.

Heading into this weekend,
the Wildcats look like the team to
beat. Last year they won the regu-
lar season title as well as the South-
ern Conference tournament. This
year, with the second or third seed,
some pressure will be lifted off the
team to repeat.

“This team has played. really
hard despite our injuries,” said
Coach Hundley. “This week we
need to assume we won't have
Lucia and Heather and for people
to continue to step up so we can
find new offensive combinations
for the tournament.”

_. Davidson will play Géoksin
Southern, and Furman and Appa-
lachian State meet in the four-team
tournament.

The squad also says goodbye
to three key seniors this weekend
who have made big contributions
tothe program in their stay: Heather
Wineberg, Shannon Lowrance, and
Claudia Lombard. ;

Added Hundley: “There has
been outstanding leadership from
these three, each in their own way,
all the way through. This has been
the most unified team I have had
and it shows on the field. These
girls will be tough to replace.”

Tourneys

that is key to running games. What
itcomes down to is how you handle
detail.”

He added that the experience
of the final four helped build that
infrastructure and understanding
of strengths. In the first year of the
final four, Sargent said, Davidson
lost $60,000, but in the two succes-
sive years the school improved the
way it handled the tournament and
made up that revenue.

Davidson hosted the champi-
onships from 1992-94, and the tour-
nament was widely viewed as a
huge success. Before coming to
Davidson, the final four attracted
sparse crowds and meager public-
ity at the previous host sites. But
the event sold out each year it was
here, even though additional seats
were added every year.

“The NCAA’s were a hugely
successful event for Davidson, just
not financially,” Sargent said. “The
Admissions Office benefitted as
much as anybody. Coaches used it
in recruiting, etc. In order to do it,
we had to improve the stadium, the
lighting, get a higher scoreboard,
but the ancillary benefits of the
NCAA were huge, while finan-
cially it was a wash.”

The Southern Conference
tournaments will not have the same
national exposure, but Sargent says
that it adds to Davidson’s reputa-
tion as a host school. He sees these
tournaments as a stepping stone to
future events, including a possible
exhibition game between the U.S.
and German men’s soccer teams
and maybe a World Cup qualify-
ing game.

“There are three revenue pro-
ducing tourneys (in Southern Con-
ference men’s athletics): Basket-
ball, football playoffs and the base-
ball tourney,” Sargent explained.
“We are trying to pattern the soc-
cer tourney on the conference base-
ball tournament. It is in much the
same way as we tried to pattern the
NCAA’s on Omaha. . . . The bud-
get we presented has been accepted.
We now have to produce sponsors
and ticket sales to cover it. If rev-
enues outstrip sales then all teams
‘split the leftover revenue (accord-
ing to the number of games played
in the tournament, so one game
equals one revenue share). Qur
objective is to run a successful
event and give a little back to each
team to cover expenses.”

The volleyball tournament,

according to Sargent, is handled
similarly to most of the non-rev-
enue producing sports within the
conference. The sites vary, anditis
run on a Southern Conference for-
mat.

Tickets for the soccer tourna-
ments are now on sale in the ticket

office and will be on sale at the
gate. Ticket books for all four ses-
sions are $8 or $4. session. Books
will be on sale for the first two
sessions, and all spectators must
pay to attend, including Davidson
students. Volleyball tickets will be
$3 per session.

Men’s soccer coach Charlie
Slagle and women’s coach Kevin
Hundley are both excited about the
tournaments being at Davidson,
and both said it will be a more
intimate place to play than Bryant
Park in Greensboro: where it was
held last year.

“We’re excited that the tour-
nament is on a campus site and not
aneutral one,” Hundley said. “The
tournament was not very well at-
tended by any school in the past,
and the on-campus support will be
great particularly if we reach the
finals on Sunday.”
