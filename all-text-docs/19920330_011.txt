Men's Tennis Loses Three Straight.

By Brannon Buck

After seven straight wins, the
Davidson men’s tennis season took
aturn for the worse this past week.
The team lostall three matches and
is now trying to get back on track.

Things were still very upbeat
after last Saturday..Coach Frank
took his team to Charleston South-
em and came away with his sev-
enth victory in a row. The “Cats
dominated at every position and
eventually won the match 9-0.
Charleston Souther, with inferior
talent, simply never had a‘chance.

Three days later the team en-
countered much stronger competi-
tion in a home match against
Winthrop. Perhaps overconfident
from their previous wins, Davidson
proceeded to lose 5-4 in an unin-
spired effort. Russell Briggs,
Daniel Grinnan, and Dave
Tonidandel kept the match even
after singles with three good wins,
but Davidson could only manage a
victory at number three doubles.

Briggs and Dale Voeks had a
chance to pull out the victory at
number two doubles, but lost 7-5,
7-6. Coach Frank was not pleased
with his team’s performance. “This
is a match we should have won.
We came outa little flat, and they
fought harder than us.”

Things did: not improve the
following day when Davidson met
Furman, The bad weather which |
forced the match inside was reflec-
tive of the outcome for the ‘Cats.
Davidson lost 8-1, but there were
several close matches.

Tonidandel playedexcellentin
his 6-3, 6-3 victory at number six.
But by far the most exciting match
of the day came at-number two
singles. David Jesperson played
some of his very best tennis in a
tough loss to Ashley Gaines.
Jesperson went up 5-2 in the third
set, but Gaines was able to fight
back to win 7-6, 4-6, 7-5.

Davidson struggled again on
Saturday against a very talented

Campbell team. The fall of com-
munism has not been felt on this
team; all six players being from
either Hungary or Czechoslova-
kia. The ‘Cats went up against
players whose names included:
Lazzlo, Zoltan, Levante, Igor, and
Dragan. Holt Vaughn played great
and provided Davidson’s only
victory of the day winning 7-5, 6-
2. But the 8-1 loss was not totally
disappointing for Davidson. The
team played well, and there were
several: close matches: which the
players feel they can improve onat:
the Big South tournament.
The team travels to UNCC on|
Thursday, and then returns home|
next Sunday in a match against
Western Carolina. Frank hopes that |

his team, with a 12-6 record, will _

rebound from these losses and
make a strong showing before the
conference tournament in three
weeks.

ing, Davidson upped its confer-
ence record to 2-1 with an easy 8-
1 victory. Ruth came back from
the dead to win at number four;
down 5-2 in the third set, she
swept the final five games to win
7-5,

In Greenville this weekend,
the ‘Cats suffered a 9-0 loss toa
talented Furman, but rebounded
with a6-3 win over UNCC. Hess,
Ruth and Wilcox were straight-
set winners in singles. Barbara
Grooms, at number six, stormed
from behind to take a 4-6, 6-2, 6-
0 win. The doubles teams of
Grooms/Ruth and Wilcox/Beahm
earned victories to cement the
win.

In preparation for the confer-
ence tournament, to be held April
16-19 at Davidson, Price’s em-
phasis in practice is on aggres-
siveness, especially what she calls
“return attack.” In her mind, the
tournament title will likely be
decided by. bounces that could
benefit either side. “‘We feel like
if our game keeps maturing, those
bounces will go our way,” she
says.
