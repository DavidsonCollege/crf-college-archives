The Polish Crisis:
Three Statements :

The following statement is from the

Strike Committe of the Szczecin port and

shipyard in Szczecin, Poland.

December 14, 1981

To all nations and people of good will ©

who value the cause of democracy, Sree-
_ dom, and workers’ rights:

| At the risk of their lives and personal

freedom, despite the Draconian orders .

of martial law, despite the attempt to
fetter us with féar, hundreds..of thou-
sands of Polish workers and patriots
went on strike, voicing the following
demands: .

--that the declaration of a state of war be
revoked;

--that all those arrested be freed;
--that all democratic and union rights
won by the nation in August be restored.

We appeal to you:

Support us in our struggle :with.
mass protests. Support us with moral
aid. Do not stand idly by while demo-
cracy in the heart of Europe is in danger
of being stifled at birth. Be with us in
these difficult moments. Solidarity with
Solidarity. Poland has not yet perished.

At midnight on December 13, 1981, the
Polish army and police raided the offi-
ces of the independent trade union “So-
lidarity”; thousands, perhaps. tens of
thousands of people were arrested in
their homes. The prime minister, minis-

ter of defense, and first Secretary ¢ of the;

Polish Communist, Party 1 in one person,
General’ Jaruzelski, declared martial
law.

Polish society, i “Whose “over:

whelming support Solidarity, has. its

strength, has exercised tremendous re- -

straint in the face of countless acts of

provocation on the part of the govern--

ment. In the course of sixteen months of
existence, Solidarity. has committed no

illegal acts; it has rigorously respected
the Polish constitution and all forms of
political life accepted i in civilized socie-
ties. Each and every voice from. Solidar-
ity,,even if termed “radical” Rory

munist party or the Wester
been-no. more than the exercise

tin “ign hth kdl od Pana ’ The So-

viet Union has been intervening in Pol-
ish internal affairs-since 1944. The junta
-of General Jaruzelski, by linking the ar-

rests of Solidarity members to those of —
former party officials, is clearly at-

tempting to blame Solidarity for the
thirty-six years of indolent and devastat-
ing communist rule which have brought
Poland to economic collapse. The

striked called by Solidarity have result-
- ed in the loss of one day’s work in six-

teen months; the losses due to misman-
agement and lack of supplies have re-

sulted in the loss of over twenty days of

work.

We appeal to every democratic go-
vernment, and to all those who believe
in the Polish people’s right to basic free-
doms, immediately t6 halt all transac-
tions, economic-and other, with Poland,

until every member of Solidarity is
freed.

"On the night of December 12, the
Polish authorities decided to declare So-
lidarity illegal--this means they decided
to declare society illegal.

cords at eh‘énd of: ‘September 1980, it ‘:

was if the hope that from thjis moment

would change, that the process, of econ-.,

mic collapse would be stopped, and that

hopes were misguided. In the course of

the authorities, the strike, the political

(In 1981, strikes took up little more than

"one working | day.) -

It is hardly surprising that Polish
society has no confidence in the govern-.

or expectations. have, been realized, we.

have with increasing frequency had to .
demand structural changes in the system:

these demand led to.a call for a national
referendum on the degree of confidence
on the part of the people in the existing *
