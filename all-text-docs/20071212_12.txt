The women’s basketball team continued its five-game home
winning streak on Thursday against East Tennessee State but
could not extend the streak in a hotly contested game against
seventh-ranked Georgia on Saturday.

Danielle Hemerka ’08 and Alex Thompson °10 led the
Wildcats to a 79-61 victory over ETSU, scoring 16 and 14
points, respectively. Hemerka shot four of six from three-point
range to match her career-best while Thompson sunk two of
four from beyond the arc to spark her career high point total.
The ’Cats shot 9-of-19 on three-pointers for the game.

The Wildcats also delivered on the team level. Sharing the
ball on offense, the team produced 17 assists on 23 made buck-
ets. On the defensive side, Davidson’s zone defense broke the
Bucs’ rhythym, forcing ETSU into 29% shooting to help offset
Davidson’s 27 turmovers.

The Wildcats built a 22-10 lead with 8:42 remaining in the
first half after a 10-0 run fueled by Hemerka and maintained the
lead throughout the half to obtain the 29-21 edge going into the
locker rooms.

The Bucs mounted a charge in the second half behind their
leading scorer TaRonda Wiles, closing to within 42-38 midway
through the second half. The Wildcats answered, shutting the
door on ETSU with a 17-5 mn keyed by seven points from
Honna Housley ’08. The run gave the Wildcats a 59-43 lead
with just over five minutes remaining. With ETSU resorting to
fouls for its final chance, Davidson then made 15-of-16 free
throws in the game’s final minutes to seal the victory. The team
was 24-of-28 from the line for the game.

The Wildcats followed their fifth straight home victory with
a tough 79-65 defeat at seventh-ranked Georgia,

Julia Paquette °10, a native of Stockbridge, Ga., led the
Wildcats with 14 points in her homecoming.

This week the men’s basketball team lost two games
away from Belk Arena against UNC Charlotte and
UCLA. The two losses drop Davidson’s overall record to
3-5.

The Wildcats ran into the 49ers’ Leemire Goldwater on
a career day. Goldwater sunk a career-high nine three-
pointers in the contest, scoring 21 points in the second
half to bring his total to 34 for the game. Charlotte also
had help from An’Juan Wilderness and Lamont Mack,
who added 12 points and 11 points, respectively.

Stephen Curry ’10 almost matched Goldwater, scoring
32 points in the contest on 9-of-19 shooting a 7-of-14
mark from beyond the arc. The game was the sixth time
Curry scored 30 points or more as a Wildcat. Stephen is
now sixth all-time in three-pointers with 159 after only 37
games.

Point-guard Jason Richards ’08 collected his sixth
career double-double, scoring 11 points and distributing
12 assists. Richards remains the nation’s leader in assists
and the fourth leading assist man in Davidson history
with 443.

While Boris Meno ’08 and Thomas Sander ’08 both
collected double-digit boards to give Davidson the 49-38
edge in rebounding, the Wildcat shooting woes continued,
making only 10 three-pointers in 34 attempts.

The game began with a horrible display of shooting
from both teams; Davidson and Charlotte missed 13 con-
secutive shots from the field and free throw line in the
game’s first 90 seconds. Charlotte built a bit of a cushion

“It was great getting to play against UGA,” Paquette
said. “We responded well, by maintaining our compo-
sure against some of the best players in the country. I
think it was a testament to the sort of impact we could
have in the SoCon this year. There’s nothing like having
friends and family at our games.”

Contributions came from all corners against the
Bulldogs. Kelly Gassie "09 added 13 points off the
bench, Housley joined her with 13 and Hemerka tallied
12 in the game.

The Wildcats drilled five three-pointers in the first 12
minutes to claim a 23-20 advantage with just over seven
minutes left in the first half. Unfortunately, the hot shoot-
ing cooled quickly, and Davidson finished just 6-of-24
from beyond the arc.

The Bulldogs ended the half with a remarkable 17-2
run to claim a 37-25 edge. Despite giving up the first
four points of the second half to the determined
Davidson squad, Georgia pulled away from the persist- ‘
ent Wildcats, opening a 21 point lead and cruising home
with a 14-point win.

“Being competitive with the number seven team in the
nation was a confidence boost for our team,” Gassie
added. “Knowing that we can run our system against a
team with some of the best athletes around is a definite
spark for us especially before we begin conference play.”

Angel Robinson led the Bulldogs with 17 points,
while three-time All-American Tasha Humphrey
claimed her sixth consecutive double-double with 10
points and 10 rebounds to lead Georgia to victory.

The Bulldogs out-rebounded Davidson 54-32, includ-
ing a 23-10 edge on the offensive glass.

Davidson returns to Belk Arena for a non-conference

after a barrage of three pointers and a Phil Jones dunk, but
two three pointers launched by Curry led a surge that gave
the ’Cats an 18-12 lead, the biggest of the half. After
Charlotte eroded the deficit, Stephen Rossiter ’09 made a
backdoor layup to give Davidson a 36-35 halftime lead.

The second half saw both teams maneuvering for posi-
tion. With the game tied at 58 with 4:02 remaining in the
game, Goldwater hit three crucial three-pointers to spark a
12-4 run from which Davidson could not recover. Although
Davidson cut the deficit to two points, Goldwater’s ninth
three-pointer sealed Davidson’s fate.

On Saturday, Davidson traveled across the country to
play the storied UCLA Bruins. The last time Davidson
played UCLA was Jan. 3. 1975. The ’Cats lost that game
91-64.

In this season’s contest, Curry again led the Wildcats in
scoring with 15 points, but his performance again proved
too little to push Davidson over the top. Richards joined his
fellow guard in double-digits with 13 points and seven
assists.

In the beginning of the UCLA game, everything fell into
place for Davidson. The Wildcats jumped ahead by 18
points in the first half owing to a 6-9 performance from
three-point range to begin the game. Bryant Barr ’10 and
Sander combined to hit four consecutive three pointers dur-
ing this first half run. Barr scored nine points off the bench
for the Wildcats, while Sander sunk seven.

The first half was reminiscent of Davidson’s 2005 NIT
contest against Maryland. In that game, the Wildcats led by
17 points before the Terrapins made a
tun to tie the game at halftime.

Unfortunately, the Wildcats fell vic-
