IN HOC. SIGNO VINCES.

lt must be of some comfort to our Slater-fed readers to
see this sign every day as they pass through the line and
to know that someone back there cares. But one wonders,
do they really obey the sign? Is everything in the food really

on a recipe? Hmm....

While serving as pastor of
the First Reformed Church
of Newark, Iverson, a 1949
Davidson graduate, decided
that the ghetto youth needed
a place to come, to and
“‘someone ‘to communicate
with.’ So he decided to set
up the Cross Counter Lunch-
eonelttte in the Newark slums
to give a place where ghetto
youths might be able to find
jobs, and also as a sort of
“‘rescue mission'’’ for delin-
quents, . .
he youth of the Newark
community need someone to
discuss their problems with,

Acting in regard to a
growing concern among
members of the sophomore
class, the Education Policy
Committee stressed in its
meeting Monday that there
have been no. change in re-
quirements for that class un-
der the extended Studies

Or. Jay H. Ostwalt, asso-
ciate’ dean of the faculty
and registrar, said that the
EPC emphasized that the
present sophomore class will
be given the option of taking
two courses to fulfill extend-
ed studies requirements.

Already available to sop-
homores are options of area
exams, reading lists and
evaluations, and special pro-
jects approved by area stu-
dies committees. ;

The action by the EPC
came as a result of confu-

In addition to the Open

in the Green Room of the

allocated after the present-
ation to allow Iverson to

his work for possible stu-
dent internships.

The Honors College,
of the prominent innovations
in Davidson’s curriculum,
has made a ‘‘promising be-
ginning,’’ according to
Frontis Johnston, dean of
the Honors College.

Dean Johnston pointed to
the fact that twenty-four
students are already enrol-
led in the program, and that
more will be accepted later
this month.

‘Most. of those enrolled
split their course load by
taking one or more courses
in the regular college pro-
gram and independent stu-
dy in the honors program,”
he remarked.

‘Later in the fall term,
individual students will. give
public readings of their re-
search,’’ he said.

Composer. Heinz Werner
Zimmerman and organ pro-
fessor David Craighead will
be guest artistlecturers for
Davidson’s' eleventh annual
Sacred Music Convocation on
Nov. 13-14.

Zimmerman, a- native_ of
Germany whose church mu-
sic-in jazz idiom has receiv-
ed international attention,
will speak in Hodson Hall
at 11 a.m. and .2 p.m. Fri-
day on ‘‘Modern Music for

over academic requirements
early last year led to
a confrontation between the

concerned students and ad-’

ministrators.

“Present sophomores,”
Ostwalt said, ‘‘can meet:
their requirements, with an
extra course taken in the
spring terms of their fresh-
man and sophomore years.

“Those students in the
sophomore class who so de-
sire Gan satisfy the require-
ments by taking an exami-
ination in one of the four
areas and by taking only
one extra course.

Johnston also noted that
four of ithe students are:
presently involved in stu-
dies away from the David-
son’ campus. Two of these;
Jimmy. Trussell and Rich
Cowart, are working in se-
minars at the University of

North ‘Carolina at’ Chapel

members—working—with—the
program, he. said, who split
their time and energies: be-
tween their regular depart-
ments and the Honors Col-
lege.

‘Each student has an_ad-
visor (one of the five facul-
ty members) to help him ar-
range his program and to
guide him,’’ Johnston said.

‘Pointing to plans for the
future, Johnston mentioned

Of Extended Studies Plan

sent freshman class vary
somewhat. Whereas the sop.
homores can satisfy their
requirements with two extra

courses, freshmen can get

extended studies credit. for

_ only one extra course. The

remaining credit must be
achieved by passing an area
examination, by passing an
evaluation of an_ in-depth
reading list, or by complete-

-ing some approved special

project.

Extended studies pro-
grams in the junior and
senior years are to be done
within the major depart-
ments of the individual stu-
dents.

Ostwalt said that there

are several alternatives
that the EPC is presently

‘working on under the ex-

tended ‘studies curriculum.
Among these options are
possible experimental pro-
grams such as special semi-
nars, work projects, and
college-wide programs, such
as concerts and films on re-
levant topics.

(Meanwhile, sophomore
class president Bob Ed-
munds has called for a class
meeting Tuesday afternoon
in Hodson Hall at 4 to talk
with Dr. John (M. Bevan,
vice president for academic
affairs. Edmonds said that
the primary: topic for dis-
cussion will be the Extended
Studies Program.

building, the Carolina Inn,
which the college owns. He

‘ said that President Spencer

had proposed to the trustees
that the’ buiding be renovat-
ed ‘to become the Honors
‘College headquarters.

“The trustees approved
the recommendation, | but .
more monéy is needed be-
fore the project can be be-
gun,” he noted.

Speaking on the prospects
for future applicants, John-
ston stated, ‘‘We invite any-
one to apply for admission
for the winter’ term or
thereafter. One can get a
general statement of policy
from my office in Eumen-
ean Hall.”

The application deadline
for the winter term is Nov-
ember ‘sixteenth, he said.
Interviews would be con-
ducted later in the month
followed by notification of
acceptance.

Commenting on the Honors
College as it now exists
early in its formative years,
Johnston remarked. ‘‘In my
judgment, it has made a
promising beginning.

‘We. have numerous indi-
vidual programs underway
upon which no permanent
judgment can yet be made.
However, we believe that
the flexibility and challenge
of the Honors College pro’
gram provides a great op:
portunity for the students
and meets one of their eee
needs.

“T hope to see it expand
in the immediate future,
both jn numbers of students
and faculty.”
