Last Thursday, the College hosted
areading by alumni Charles Wright,
graduate of 1957 and now Pulitzer
Prize-winning poet.

Wright presented this year’s
Vereen Bell Awards to students Emily.
Drew ’04,Tim Westover 04, and Jes-
sica Broaddus ’06 for their excep-
tional work in creative writing.

Holland.

A poet himself, Holland describes
the acclaimed poetry of his colleague
Wright as a blend of Italian and Tang
dynasty Chinese poetry.

Wright’s poetry collection “Black

-Zodiac” won the Pulitzer Prize in

1998, among other international hon-
ors.

Few students know Dr. Holland as
the man who learned to cuss from
John McCain or whose favorite wres-
tling hold is the “Navy Ride.”

Most see him on the first floor of
E.H. Little Library, where he spends
his office hours sharing his love of
literature.

Holland has taught at Davidson for

39 years, leading courses in compo-

AIC proposes budgets

~ By ADAM MartIN
Senior Staff Writer

SGA will meet tonight to approve
or disapprove, as a whole, the pro-
posed 2004-2005 budgets for every
chartered student organization at
Davidson College.

While the SGA must approve the
budgets, its advisory body, the Ac-
tivities Tax Council (ATC), is the
primary arbiter of student organiza-
tion wealth at the College.

The Director of College Union and
Coordinator of Student Activities
William Brown automatically sits on
the ten-member council.

“It’s very difficult for SGA to ex-
amine each budget carefully. You
need a small group that is not terri-
bly public,” he said.

“We try to determine what’s the
best use of student’s money,” said
ATC Chair Elizabeth Matthews ’04.
“We ask how does this organizations’
activities serve the school and stu-
dent interests, how do they align with
stated purpose of group, and has the
group done what it said it would do
with last year’s money?”

The ATC recommendation for next
year promises $406,550 for various
student activities, as described in the

annual budgets of SGA-chartered
student organizations.

51 percent of those funds,
$207,457, will go to the Union board
to fund activities such as (licensing
for) Movies at Midnight, Trivia, Af-
ter Midnight Breakfasts, speakers,
etc, and also to pay for a portion of
the main concert each semester.

The organization budgets are fi-
nanced directly by the Student Ac-
tivities Tax that every enrolled stu-
dent must pay each semester.

The ATC also recommends the
Activities Fee amount to SGA every
year. The recommended amount is
on the order of $125 per student.

College Republicans vs. Young
Democrats ~

If the ATC proposal passes as rec-
ommended, the College Republicans
will receive more than 2.5 times as
much money as the Young Demo-
crats.

Last year the ATC decided to give
both organizations equal amounts,
despite very disparate requests, as not
to appear politically biased.

They gave both groups $625, the
amount that was requested by the

A room of their own

RLO allows art project to remain in Little

By LeEsur HEmPSON
Senior Staff Writer

Fora Basic Studio art project last
semester, Emily Rodda ’06 and
Richardson LaBruce ’06 painted ev-
ery single word of Virginia Woolf’s
classic essay ““A Room of One’s
Own” on the walls and ceiling of a
first Little spare room.

Those words were supposed to be
painted over at the end of this se-
mester as part of an agreement be-
tween RLO and the students, but
Leslie Urban, Associate Director of
Residence Life, said Monday that
her department would leave the art-
work intact.

Since Rodda was away fromcam-
pus this spring studying in Spain,
her first semester roommate, Nicole
Mader ’06, made it her mission to
preserve the artwork. :

The project started in fall 2003
when Ray Kleinlein, Visiting Assis-
tant Professor of Art and instructor

‘ of the Basic Studio class, directed

his students to create a piece of con-
ceptual art.

Rodda and LaBruce knew that
they “were going to have to do
something over the top” to get the
final grade they wanted and on a
whim, proposed copying a “‘shortes-
say” onto the walls of the room.

That “short essay” of seven pages
soon turned into a long essay of 207
pages.

Richardson read the essay out
loud, while Rodda, paint pen in
hand, wrote the words for as long as
90 minutes at a time.

After approximately 80 hours of
hard work, Rodda and Labruce were
done.

They finished just in time: the
project was due at 10 a.m., and
Rodda painted the last word at 8:30
a.m. that morning. :

Rodda wrote by e-mail, “I think
we were both secretly proud of our
