Spencer, Smith, Jackson Head
Star Studded Cast In
Presentation
Last Tuesday evening, March 16,
at_715, the Red and Black Mas-
quers, Davidson's dramatic organ-
ization, presented the comedy hit

oi-Broadway.-a-year_or_so ago, John
Kesselring’s‘Arsenic.and Old Lace”.

Starring in the campus production
Sam Spencer as Mortimer
Brewster, Clara Smith as Abby
Brewster, and Miss Susie Jackson
as Martha Brewster. The production
was staged by Frank Mebane, and
Prof. E. J. Erwin had charge of the
stage effects. Managers were
George Worth and George McCor-
inick,

were

The performance, given in Cham-
bers Auidtorium, was attended by
a large and appreciative audience,
who turned out to see the cast, who
had presented other productions of
equal success in the past. Spencer,
Miss Smith, and Miss Jackson, were
all léading performers in’ the Mas-
quers last play, “The Man Who
Came to Dinner.”

Special Make-up

Special wardrobes and makeup
were ordered from New York to
make the play even more effective,
as they will be the same as are now
being used in the Broadway produc-
tion.

The plot for the play revolved
around the Brewster family, all of
whom are insane. Mortimer Brew-
ster, played by Sam Spencer, was
able to untangle some of the mixed
affairs of the family and to bundle
them off to the various institutions
where they belonged.

A large portion of the credit for
the brilliant performance of the play
at Davidson is due to Director Me-
bane, also president of the group,
and to Prof. Erwin, who handled
the staging of the play.

The cast for the play was as fol-
lows:

Abby. Brewster ..-..--- Clara Smith
Rev. Dr. Harper--Lamar Williamson

Quiz Program
Held In YMCA

Foreman Questions Board of
Experts on Bible

Davidson's new Y.M.C.A. was the

scene of a battle of wits Sunday
night after vesper services, when
two students and two members of

the faculty made up a board of ex-
perts at whom Bible questions were
fired,

The members of the faculty were
Professor Erwin and’ Dr. Hood and

the student representatives were

hand to ask the questions and Bill
Slymie Lyman was Master of Cere
monies.

Professor Erwin showed so much
knowledge of the Bible that many
of the audience wondered why hx
had been teaching English. No one
could touch Dr. Harding as far as
the questions concerning Job and
Songs of Solomon went, and many
of the more general questions were

McCrary.

Programs Are New

The Sunday evening programs are
a new feature at the Y.M.C.A. this
semester and are arranged so as to
have a musical program every othe>
Sunday. The first of the series drew
only—small crowds but the attend-
ance has built up nicely until now
there is quite a crowd on hand every
week.

Next Sunday the program wil! be
a listening hour of music of the old
masters and should prove as enter-
taining and enjoyable.as the musical
programs of the past. Everyone is
cordially invited to attend.

Air Corps Cadets Start Their
Academic Work
Davidson's _ newly arrived group of
Air Corps Cadets started their first

classes) at Davidson last Monday
morning.
For the first week of their stay

here the cadets had no classes be-
cause of a sort of orientation period

and an adjustment of professors’
classes so as’ to be able to hold
classes for students and_ soldiers

alike
Scheduled Altered

As is already known, the sched-
ule of classes was altered slightly
last week to meet the problem aris-
ing from the conflicting time table
of the students and-—cadets

Since the type course that the ca-
dets take is limited to only certain
subjects, many professors, who have
been teaching other courses, have
been changed over to help out those
professors who'are necessarily load-
ed down with the number of classes
which they have to teach a day. The
teachers have all expressed the opin-
ion that the cadets are very willing
and courteous pupils.. —
