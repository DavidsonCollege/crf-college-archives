Making copies...

_ Student demand brings more machines

By JENNIFER KERNS
Staff Writer

After requests from SGA, the
library has ordered a fourth copier
to be delivered next week. Library
Director Leland Park approved the
proposal drafted by senior senator
Chad Lloyd, sending a copy of his
research findings to SGA Presi-
dent Bill-Gullan. 5

Park says, ““We’re here for the
students. If there’s a real need for
a fourth copier, then we will pro-
vide it.”

Park looked into the other op-
tions proposed by SGA such as the

Cat card system for the copiers.
With a cost of $8,000 to set up and
maintain the system, Park says the
system could never make the cost
worthwhile.

“We get our money mostly
from the copies students make, and
if having a fourth copier will in-
crease the volume, we will buy it.
Ata cost of $30,000 it will pay for

itself considering thé 600,000 cop- °

ies students make every year.
Park also looked at the possi-
bility of copier cards, used at big-
ger universities such as Chapel Hill
or UNCC. “With the cards, we
could change the copier price to

maybe seven cents, and students
would not need cash with a card.
However, the card would be just
one more thing for students to carry
with them, and they would lose
money on it. Plus we would have
the added job of computerizing the
cards and machines.”

Park called a company about
credit card copiers; however, the
Raleighcompany went out of busi-
ness before he could talk with them
about this system.

Therefore, the new copier will
come, but will run as a coin oper-
ated system as the current machines
do.

“T’ve always been interested
in politically changing societies.
Two summers ago I went to Bul-
garia on a Dean Rusk grant and
wanted to continue studying that
society. It didn’t hurt to have a
recommendation from Ambassa-
dor Jack Perry.” Perry is Director
of Davidson’s Dean Rusk program
and is a former U.S. Ambassador
to Bulgaria.

“The Fulbright foundation
works to better mutual understand-
ing between citizens of both the
U.S. and another country. You go
to the country as an ambassador,
but the focus is of an academic
nature,” says Rosenbach.
Although most Fulbright

scholarships go to Ph.D. candi-
dates doing field research, they
occasionally goto people who have
just completed undergraduate
study, explains Professor of Politi-
cal Science and Chairman of
Davidson’s Fulbright Committee
Dr. Louis Ortmayer. ‘‘Competi-
tion is keen but uneven in terms of
countries,” says Ortmayer. The
bigger and more popular the coun-
try chosen, the smaller the odds of
receiving a Fulbright become.

Davidson students interested
in applying for the scholarship
sumbit proposals to Ortmayer’s

committee. The committee inter-
views candidates and then recom-
mends them to the Fullbright Foun-
dation in New York. The founda-
tion then selects those best quali-
fied to follow through with their
proposals. The program provides
winners with funds for interna-
tional travel and a stipend for room
and board at a university.

Two other Davidson students,
senior political science majors
Danny Newman and Sherry
Abdelaaty, were also nominated
for the scholarship and are still
waiting to hear results. Abdelaaty

in Egypt, a Muslim country.
Newman hopes to study public
health in India.

Crosby, Carlson
to lead women’s
sexuality forum

Group will explore body image,
sensuality, and sexuality

By JENNIFER KERNS
Staff Writer

As part of Women’s Month,
Dr. DeWitt Crosby of the Davidson
Counseling Center and former
Women’s Committee Chair Sara
Carlson ‘93 will lead a women’s
sexuality discussion Thursday,
March 23 at 7 p.m. in the Carolina
Inn.

Carlson says, “We don’t want
a boring lecture that will make you

- feel uncomfortable. We want to

have activities to generate discus-
sion. We want this to be fun.”
They intend to explore with
participants the interrelatedness of
body image, sensuality, and sexu-
ality. Crosby says, “How we view
our bodies effects the way we see

ourselves sensually and sexually.
Many women repress their sexual
natures, when we were born sexual
creatures.

“We want to have a women-
only discussion because the issue
of sexuality is very hard for some
women to talk about, especially in
mixed groups. We would like to
have a mixed age group, with stu-
dents, faculty, and staff sharing.

“T think this discussion would
be called X-rated because we will
be talking about some things that
could make people uncomfortable.
However, we don’t want to force
anyone to talk. We want to raise
issues as well as answer questions.”

Anyone who wishes to attend
should call Sara Carlson at -2241
to sign up.
