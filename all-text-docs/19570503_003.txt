THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE THREE

BY
GEORGE RAMSEY

Every year about this time, a Davidson athlete is
chosen to be honored as the one who best exemplifies
the Davidson spirit, and to this individual is presented
the Tommy Peters Memorial Trophy, in honor of the
Davidson athletic star of 1942-43, who was killed in
World War Hi.

Let’s dig into the files and get some idea of the
accomplishments of some of the outstanding Peters
trophy winners.

The initial presentation of the trophy, was fit-
tingly made to the brother of the man whose name
the trophy bears. George Peters, a three sport star
at , was, in 1947, the first recipient. George
excelled in football, basketball, and track, and was
named Honor Man of 1947 for the three sports.

Two years later the award was won by Buddy Cheek,
who won a permanent spot in Davidson basketball history
by earning mention on the Helms Foundation All-Ameri-
can team, along with such players as Bob Cousy of Holy
Cross, Bill Sharman of Southern Cal, and Ralph Beard
of Kentucky. Needless, to say, Buddy nailed down a
Southern Conference position at forward.

ATHLETE OF YEAR

Whit Cobb, who won honor as the Southern Con-
ference Athlete of the Year, was the 1950 winner. Whit
excelled in anything he tried. As a freshman, he per-

sonally won the interfraternity track meet, for the Phi
Delts. Then he turned to basketball and tennis, in which
he distinguished himself as an all-time Wildcat great.
He is now tennis coach at Duke.

The 1951 award winner was Davidson’s all-
time passing great, and one of the nation’s top
aerial artists, Auburn Lambeth, who ranked in the
first ten in passing completions in American inter-
collegiate history. Lambeth co-captained the Wild-
cat baseball team in the spring.

“Little Johnny” Gray, football quarterback and cap-
tain of the baseball team, was chosen as the Wildcat
best showing the Peters spirit in 1954. “Little Johnny
was hot as a firecracker” was a familiar expression that
year. Though he was injured midway through the grid-
iron season, he was in no way hampered from shining
at an infield position in the spring.

ROWLAND WINS

Bill Rowland, the happy one from Gastonia, was
recognized in 1955 for his spirit as shown on the
baseball diamond. As a halfback and outfielder, re-
spectively, he won the admiration of his teammates

in both sports.

Last year’s winner was Phil Koonce, ’Cat track star
who captured conference titles in the 100-and-220-yard
dashes and the broad jump.

Donny McRee, this year’s winner, seems a fitting
choice to continue the line of those who honor a man
who gave his all for his country.

The Wildcats defeated the
