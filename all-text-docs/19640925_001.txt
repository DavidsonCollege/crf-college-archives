With 702 students voting, the poll represents the
largest balloting by Davidson students in recent years.

In this survey, Goldwater won
the support of the majority of
Southern students, and John-
son won that of the non-South-
ern students.

The 559 students voting from
the 11 Southern states provid-
ed Goldwater a margin of 36
votes over Johnson. The vote
from this group was 263 for
the President, 296 for the hope-
ful from Arizona.

Non-Southern students who
voted, however, gave a lead
of 12 votes to Johnson. There
were 133 non-Southern stud-
ents who voted, of the 702 votes
cast.

“FRONTLASH”
The ‘frontlash” ySte (made
up of declared Republicans who
,.are voting Democratic in this
election) equalled closely the
“backlash” vote (traditional De-
mocrats going Republican); 54
Democrats voted for Goldwater,
and 51 Republican voted for
Johnson.

Among Southerners, however,
the gap was larger. There were
52 Democrats who voted for
Goldwater and 38 Republicans
who voted for Johnson. Ap-
parently, the “frontlash” occurs
among both Southerners and
non-Southerners; on the other
hand, all but: two of the votes
evincing ‘‘blacklash"’ were
from the South.

A breakdown of the vote by
classes shows that seniors favor-

ed Johnson over Goldwater by
10 votes. Juniors delivered the
same verdict, giving Johnson
9 votes over Goldwater.

67 & ‘68 FOR AvH20
Sophomores and freshmen,
however, approved Goldwater
by margins of 23 and 26 votes,
respectively.

Special students partictpat-
ing supparted Johnson unanim-
ously.

Five Southern states
North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, Virginia, and Florida
— had enough representation
in the balloting to sanction tak-
ing a closer look at the distri-
bution of vote within their
borders.

In North Carolina, Johnson
won by a margin of 18 votes,
out of a total vote of 250 stud-
ents. 29 Independents cast their
vote for Goldwater, 24 for
Johnson. 13 Republicans switch-
ed to Johnson, 23 Democrats
switched to Goldwater. From
these two groups — the Indep
dents and the “crossovers” —
Goldwater won a surplus of 15
votes.

vote (97 Democrats for John-
son) whose force the ‘‘pure’’
Republican vote (65 for Gold-
water) could not meet. It was
the “pure” Democrats who
brought North Carolina into
Johnson’s camp.

South Carolina is a Goldwater
state, if the DAVIDSONIAN
poll mirrors the true situation.
its representatives gave Gold-
water almost two-and-one-half
times the vote they gave John-

son. The vote was 61-21.

It is also a non-Democratice
State. Of the 72 people voting
from the state, 35 South Caro-
linians claimed the Republican
for their standard-bearer, and
25 travelled the Independent
road. Only 12 were avowed
Democrats, and two of these
would have voted for Goldwat-
er on Tuesday.

YANG-YIN IN GEORGIA

Representatives from Geor-
gia, the state which has voted
Democratic in every national
election in modern times, may
be experiencing a yang-yin kind
of political struggle. 34 voted
for Johnson. 34 for Goldwater.

Virginia voted 29-25 in favor
of Goldwater, and Florida vot-
ed 34-21 for the same candidate.

Some students who did not
have an opportunity to express
themselves fully by making
checkmarks on their ballots felt
called to offer personal senti-
ments. One Democrat who vot-
ed for Johnson wrote, ‘If there
is a choice between a crackpot
and a crook, I will take the
crook.” An Independent voter
who supported Goldwater de-
manded, “Give the: government
back to the people and take it
away from the wheelers and
dealers!”

INITIATES ‘GREAT ISSUES’

Triffin Calls For Changes
| In International Banking

By HEYWARD CARTER
Davidsonian Feature Writer

In the first lecture of the YMCA Great Issues Pro-

gram for this year, renowned Yale economist Dr. Robert
Triffin charged that today’s international monetary sys-

tem is anachronistic and should be completely revamped.

The series, entitled ‘Political
Campaign: 1064” is plarined by
the Y to present the pro and
con discussions of some of
the campaign issues, instead. of
the personalities of the candi-
dates. Speakers ‘will be politi-
eal scientists, nationally-known
authors, economists and office-
holding politicians, including
Governor George Wallace of
Alabama.

Dr. Triffin explained the rea-
sons for his opinion and out-
lined ways to remedy the situa-
tion. He further explained how
really grave a_ situation this
has become and that it has
been under international dis-
cussion for the past five years
— the “Triffin plan” being one
of the feasible remedies under
consideration.

NOT ENOUGH GOLD

The problem, stated Dr. Trif-
fin, is simply that gold sup-
plies in the world today are
not adequate to provide a basis
for the world’s moneys This
situation creates a very tedious
balance in international bank-
ing and marketing — a balance
that some future crisis might
easily upset. Such an event
would ruin not only the eco-
nomy of the country or coun-
tries directly involved, but
could drastically affect the
world’s monetary transactions.

This situation is to a large
degree a result of events dur-
ing and after World War J.
At that time many European
countries, suffering from some-
what of an inflation, exported
much of their capital to the
U. S., the dollar being such a
solid form of exchange at the

‘time. As a result, the value of
this improrted, or ‘‘hot’’ money,
went down, while the value of
the much-demanded dollar
steadily rose.

After the war Europe began
to experience a new “boom”
economy, while the U. S. fought
off recession, depression, and
the same investors who put
their capital in the U. S. before
the war now began drawing
it out in large quantities. This
has gone on to such a degree
that whereas the reserves of the
U. S. were $20 billion in 1949,

they dropped to $16 dillioa in
1957, and are only $1% billion
at the present time. This re-
presents a debt of $14% bil-
lion to the central bank in
the’ last seven years. The situa-
tion does not look good.

DRASTIC REMEDIES
The remedies to this predi-
cament, according to Dr. Trif-
fin, are drastic and far from
simple. His plan, touched on

in chapel and expounded in
the coffee hour following, is
complicated but seems to be
very feasible.

First of all, the interest rates
in Europe must be lowered
and those in the U. S. must be
raised, thus keeping any more
dollars from leaving the U. S.
Also the national reserves must
grow between 3% and 6% per
year.

TEMPORARY PLAN

These, however, are more or
less temporary measures which
must be followed by much more
drastic measures: namely the
form of reserve should be
changed from gold to some new
from of security. The big ques-
tion is what this new form of
security should be. Dr. Triffin
suggests gold-guaranteed de-
posits with the international
banking fund.

ALSO LAKE CAMP US, STEAM PLANT

Union Tops Campus Changes

Davidson remodeled its College Union and completed
the boat pier on the Lake Campus, among various im-
provements make by the college this summer. The renova-
tion of the College Steam Plant is now in progress and is
slated for completion by the end of November.

The work done in the Union, at a cost of $200,000 was
Phase 2 of the Union expansion program, and consisted
of a renovation of the downstairs dining area and of air-
conditioning the whole building.

The serving counters for the cafeteria and the snack
bar were switched so that it is now possible to close off
the re-decorated dining room for cleaning and perhaps
for meals for special groups.

The remodeling of the Union also resulted in five new
dining rooms which are suitable for luncheon meetings.
Several of the rooms are so constructed that any number
of them may be joined together for large occasions.

The work done on the Lake Campus during the sum-
mer involved the placing of both railings and lights on
the boat pier.

The renovation-of the Steam Plant will result in a
new front for the building, as well as an improved steam
generating system. According to Physical Plant Director
Grover Meetze, the remodeling wil! provide “big changes
in appearance and operation, and will give us one of the
most modern and up-to-date steam plants of any institu-
tion our size.””

The new front of the Plant, which will make room
for a workshop, will be built over the area where the

coal pits are now located. The addition will have windows
all the way across and will be built of the same type
of brick as the new Union wing, thus making its archi-
tecture compatible with that of other campus buildings.

The steam plant will also be modernized inside by the
removal of two of the old steam generators and their
replacement by new ones. Each of the new generators
will have a capacity of 20,000 pounds of steam per hour.
and with the remaining old generator will provide a
total capacity of 60,000 pounds per hour.

The new generators will run mainly on_ natural
gas, with fuel oil as a standby. When the occasion a-
rises, the change from gas to oil will take only minutes,
preventing the time lag of four to five hours which oc-
curred during the gas-to-coal switch under the old sys-
tem. ‘

The generators will have free-standing control panels
with the latest safety devices and boiler efficiency in-
dicators. A whole new water treatment system will also
be installed to ready the water for use in the genera-
tors.

In addition to the major projects which have been
completed and which are now being worked on, a Phy-
siology Lab is being built in the attic of the Dana Science
Building. The lab, which will be 80 feet long, is being
built according to the needs of Professor Lammer's
physiology class. In the same area as the lab will be
fixed a place for the Biology Museum which is presently
housed in the Martin Science Building.
