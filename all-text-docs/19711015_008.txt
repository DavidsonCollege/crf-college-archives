‘Cats Take First Win At Bucknell

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

It wasn’t on the schedule, but
the Davidson Wildcats almost
played powerful Penn State last
Saturday.

The Bunknell Bison probably
wish that had happened.

The Wildcats whipped the Bi-

son 20-8 for their first win of
the season, and snapped an
eight-game losing streak dating
back to last year.

A mix-up at the Harrisburg,
Pa., airport found the ’Cats on
a bus headed for College Park
where Penn State was hosting
Army.

DAZZLING DAVIDSON DEFENSE

against Furman.

Fortunately for the ’Cats, the
error was discovered in time
for them to motor to tangle
with Bucknell, while Army
should not even have shown up,
as they lost 42-0.

The victory over the Bison,
according to Wildcat head coach
Dave Fagg, proved what he had
known all along—that the ’Cats
are getting better each week.

“We just whipped them,”
Fagg commented, ‘‘and the de
fense was tremendous.” He
noted that the defense gave
ground at times, but came
through with the big plays at
the right moments.

Fagg cited a fantastic goal-
line stand as an example of the
flexible defense whcih bent, but
didn’t break.

The entire defensive unit per-
formed well, but Fagg mention-
ed Robert Norris, Terry Wood-
lief, Mike Sikes and Ross Man-
ire as standouts.

Norris finished second in vot-
ing for Southern Conference de-
fensvie player of the week,
while sophomore Manire, play-
ing in place of injured Woody
Montgomery, nabbed an im-
portant interception.

The ‘Cats offense enjoyed its
best point production of — the
season, in spite of fewer total
vards than in previous games.

“John Ribet continued to run
like one of the finest backs in
the conference, and he made
three beautiful catches — for
about 55 yards,” Fagg stated.

Linemen Robert Elliott and
Larry Spears were praised by
Fagg for what he termed their
best game as Wildcats.

The passing of Scotty Shipp
Was not sharp against the Bi-
son, but Fagg compared a pass-
ing game to having a hot hand
in poker.

“Sometimes you'll get a good
hand to start with and no one

can beat you,” he explained,
“and our passing was the op-
posite of that. We had several
well-thrown passes dropped ear-
ly in the game, and we could
never quite get that hot hand.”

Sophomore halfback John ,We-
bel showed continued improve-
ment, as he scored two touch-
downs in the final quarter.

Fagg called the victory ‘a
real good tonic for some. sick
players and coaches.”

In the minds of many Wild-
cat fans, the defeat of Bucknell
ranks on a level with the upset
of Richmond in Fagg’s debut
as head coach last year.

The ‘tong dry spell between
victories had been rough = on
coaches and players alike, but
as Fagg puts it, ‘‘we always
tell our men to think and act
like winners.”

At Bucknell, the ‘’Cats show
ed that they can play like win-
ners.

‘Cats Risk One-Game Streak

In Furman Homecoming Tilt

One-game winning streaks are
not too much to brag about, but
the Davidson Wildcats are cer-
tainly proud of theirs, which
they put on the line tomorrow
at Furman.

Injury-Ridden Soccer Team
Battles Pfeiffer Tomorrow

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

The injury-ridden Davidson
soccer team fell into some-
thing of a slump during the
past week.

After routing three oppon-
ents and squeaking out a win
over Western Carolina, the Wild-
cats eased by Furman 2-0 last
Friday, and then soiled their
perfect record with a loss to
Duke.

Tomorrow the booters will
travel to Pfeiffer to meet that
team in their Homecoming
game.

Pfeiffer does not field a foot-
ball team, and the soccer match
will be the big athletic event
for the returning alumni.

Pfeiffer requested Davidson
as their opponent, according to
soccer coach Harry Fogleman,
and this is the second time the
Wildcats have played at Pfeif-
fer's Homecoming.

Fogleman said he felt the
team should fare well against
Pfeiffer, if they are not too
badly hampered by injuries.

Three players were injured
in*the Furman game. Fogle-
man said that the game was
very physical, and that the of-
ficiating was not up to par.

“The game really got out of
hand,” he said, ‘‘and there
was a lot of pushing and shov-
ing."

The team lost two key
linemen, Johnny Robison and
Seraphin Ghbari, to twisted

knees. Both will be out for the
about two weeks.

Fullback Helmut Bernhardt
pulled a groin muscle, and the
time of his return is unsure.

Goalie Charlie Heiner’ has
not been able to play due to an
injured knee, and backs Donnie
Bain and Robin Gray were both
roughed around and battered.

Despite these holes in the
lineup the ‘Cats were able to
pull out their fourth consecu-
tive win against Furman.

The game proved to be a lot
harder battle than most of the
players had suspected, and re-
mained scoreless’ until the
fourth quarter when exchange
Gbari booted in both Davidson
scores.

_ The team did not hold out so
well at Duke.

The Blue Devils, in the form
of a Chilean exchange student,
ran over the Wildcats 83 to
give the Davidson team their
first loss of the year.

Lepo, the South American,
scored six of the Duke goals,
and assisted on a seventh.

The Wildcats played better
than the score indicated, accord-
ing to Fogleman, and were
trailing only four to three at
the half.

“We have nothing to be
ashamed of,’ he said, ‘‘we play-
ed a fine game, and we had a
lot. of holes to fill in the line-
up.”’

‘In fact, the Duke coach
said he was amazed we could
play so well with so many boys

out of the game,’ he added.
“we were still in the game de
spite the number of cripples.”

The lack of Bernhardt and
Hainer was particularly felt in
the Duke game.

The Wildcat defense was not
able to contain the Blue Devil
attack, and with the halfbacks
constantly playing defense, the
kine was unable to maintain a
strong attack.

After Pfeiffer, the booters re-
turn to face Belmont-Abbey.

Wins into the contest, which will
be their Homecoming game.

The Paladins have a_ 2-2-1
worksheet, and have — really
come on strong after a_ slow
Start.

In their opening game the
Paladins played a scoreless tie
with Appalachian, and then lost
on successive weeks to peren-
nial NAIA powers Presbyterian
and Wofford.

VMI became the Paladins’
first victim two weeks ago, and
last Saturday Furman toppled
a strong Western Carolina team
21-14.

If recent games between the
‘Cats and the Paladins are any
indication, the technical and
highly specialized aspects of
football can be forgotten.

Wildcat head coach Dave
Fagg anticipates a very physi-
cal and emotional battle. ‘‘We
expect to continue to improve,
While they certainly have mom-
entum going for them,” he com
mented,

Two senior backs carry most
of the load for the Paladin of-
fense. Quarterback John DeLeo
and iunner Steve Crislip form

a dangerous tandem who will
put much pressure on the ’Cat
defenders,

DeLeo is quite an accurate
passer, as he threw only one
interception in 140 attempts last
year. Fagg mentioned that De-
Leo also executes the option
play very well, while Crislip is
all-conference material.

On the receiving end of De-
Leo's aerials will be junior col
lege transfer John Monferdini
and sophomores Mike Bartik
and Blake Carlyle.

Defensively the Paladins nor
mally employ an eight-man
front, or they switch into the
split-6 formation.

Tomorrow's contest should
find both teams keyed up, for
as Fagg put it,’ the team which
gets more excited will prob-
ably win.”

There will be much to get
excited about, because the Pal-
adins will be seeking another
conference win to stay within
range of William and Mary,
while the ‘Cats try to expand
their win streak and gain their
first conference triumph.

Skippers Open At UT Regatta

The Davidson sailing season
will finally get under way this
weekend with a regatta at the
University of Tennessee at
Knoxville this weekend.

Two ‘regattas had been pre-
viously scheduled for the past
two weeks, one at USC and one
at Old Dominion, but both were
called off.

The Davidson skippers will
face tough competition at the
UT race, according to Jimmy
Hunter, skipper in the A divi-
sion.

“We will be racing Flying
Juniors,” he said, ‘‘and one of
the UT skippers placed third
in the national rankings in Jun-
iors.”

Hunter said he expects the
conference teams to be fairly
equal this year, a change from
the past seasons when the sail-

ing was dominated by The Cita-
del, USC and Davidson.

USC's” superskipper, Anne
Boyd, will be returning this
year. She placed third in the
Y- Flyer Internationals during
the summer.

Hunter also
the potential

commented on
strength of the

Clemson sailors, noting that
the majority of their last year’s
team will be returning to com-
petition.

The B division skipper has
not be picked for tomorrow’s
race. Frank Somerville will
crew for Hunter, and Tom King
will crew in the B division.
