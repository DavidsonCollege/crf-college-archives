Davidson’s volleyball team (3-4) had a
disappointing week that ended with a oie
mer of hope.

On September 4. the Wildcats met the
North Carolina Tar Heels in Belk Arena,
dropping the match in three hard-fought
games.

Davidson surprised Carolina (3-1) early,
taking a quick 8-5 lead in the first game. After
tying at 20, 22, and 24, the UNC offense
proved too much.

The second and, unquestionably, most ex-
citing game was also the highest scoring.
Aggressive defense by Latisha Chapman ’04
and seniors Jacqueline and Jennifer Ortega
kept Davidson within striking distance. As
volleyball rules mandate a team must win by
at least two points, the race to 30 ended ina
35-33 win for the Tar Heels.

Davidson losta 12-6 lead in the third game,
eventually dropping 30-16.

This past weekend, the volleyball team
traveled to Williamsburg, Virginia to partici-
pate in William and Mary’s HI-IQ Classic.

The Wildcats played three games in two

days against Virginia, the
host Tribe, and Columbia
as they prepare to defend
their back-to-back South-
ern Conference crowns.

The Wildcats lost a
close four game match to
Virginia in Friday’s
opener, 30-28, 25-30, 30-
28, and 30-25. Despite the
setback, coach Tami Dar-
win must have been im-
pressed with her team’s
serving, as the ‘Cats
notched an impressive 16
aces in the match.

Senior Jacqueline
Ortega continued her
dominating play, tallying
her fifth consecutive
double-double (12 kills,
11 digs) of the season in
the UVA match.

In the second match of
the tournament, William
and Mary proved to be,
too much for the ‘Cats (30-18, 30-28, and 30-
27). The Tribe registered 52 winners to

Hoffman’s boisterous rallying. After two
kicks by Pierce and a 5-point try from
Hoffman, the “Cats emerged victorious.

The ‘Cats continue on last fall’s unde-
