VOL. LVI

The Wildcat pep band has
dsopped ‘“‘Dixie’’ from its song
selections ip response to objec-
tions from undisclosed sources
and the prodding of Athletic Di-
tector Tom Scott.

The band left off the popular
marching song for the first time
at last Saturday's Furman game
in a move marked by racial
overtones.

The silence was suggested—
but not dictated—by Scott on
Sept. 22 with the informal sup-
port of two members of the
Faculty Athletic Committee.

In addition, the Confederate
flag traditionally flown at home

football games will come down,
on Scott's orders.

Scott said this week that his
action in both cases was prompt-
ed by the “objections of some
people—some alumni, adminis-
tration and students — who ex-
pressed opinions tied in with
integration.”

He declined to further specify
the sources of complaint, saying
only that there were “half a
dozen or a dozen people” in-
volved.

The Confederate flag has
flown here on football Saturdays
for a number of years, accord-
ing to Scott, most recently atop

the gym along with the Amer-
jean flag and flags of several
other schools.

Its removal, along with the
omission of “Dixie,”’ Scott said,
came because “it was thought
that some of the colored stu-
dents would object to it. tying
it in with the Civil War.”

According to Dave Hoag. di-
rector, the band always played
“Dixie” at least once a game—
during the first time-out—and,
if Davidson won, again at the
end.

“Under existing conditions we
just felt it wouldn’t be wise to
play it.’ Scott said. “But we

couldn't tell them (the band)
not to since they're a volunteer
organization. We just recom-
mended it.”

The recommendation had the
informal endorsement of two
members of the Faculty Ath-
letic Committee, R. R. Bernard
and Locke White.

“We agreed that if the song
was causing embarrassment,
perhaps the boys might leave it
off,” said Bernard, the commit-
tee’s chairman. “It's a shame,
but anything with racial over-
tones is that way,"

Hoag emphasized that his band
was not explicitly ordered to

quiet “Dixie.” “Dr. Scott just
told me that since the school
was integrated, it would not be
a good idea to continue playing
it.

“It surprised everybody in the
band,"' Hoag said. ‘“‘They could
not believe it, but I told them
my hands were tied.”

He said the song’s popularity
stems from the crowd spirit ‘it
elicits. “‘When we didn't play it
last week at the game, at least
15 people came up to me and
asked why.”

He also said that last year the
band usually followed ‘Dixie’
with ‘‘Yandee Doodle Boy;”

“We hadn’t done it this year,
but we'd start if it would help.”

Although it was often regard-
ed as the Confederate National
Anthem during the Civil War,
“Dixie” was written in. 1859 by
an Ohio native, Daniel Decatur
Emmett, for a N. Y. minstrel
show.

Band member Geoff Seamans
said: “If the college wants to

Bondurant is confident that
Davidson, like all other colleges
taking advantage of the Ford
Foundation, will be successful in
its drive and will receive the
2.2 million. dollars from the
Foundation.

This drive is the first part of
a 10-year effort by President D.
Grier Martin to add $25 million
to the resources of the college.
At present the permanent en-
dowment of Davidson is 13 mil-
lion dollars.

Faculty Homes Reopen

One tradition, Sunday night
visitation of faculty homes, has
been preserved by the Religious
Life Committee and work is go-
ing forward to find a positive
alternative to the suspended tra-
diticn of vespers.

The committee met last Fri-
day and again yesterday in an
attempt to outline a program of
worship opportunities for the col-
lege community but reached no
other decisions that it is willing

to release.

It did agree to continue the
program of faculty open houses
on Sunday evenings even in the
absence of a formal religious
service,

During the month of October
certain faculty homes will be
open for visitation from 8 to 10
p.m. beginning October 8. A
schedule listing which homes
will be open for the four Sun-
days in October will be released

ed in this drive is in addition

from alumai and other sources
which goes into the living en-
dowment. This endowment is
used. for the normal operating
expenSes of the college and prob-
ably also for the financing of
the proposed new library.

Bondurant remarked that this
drive is the first major addi-
tional fund raising program in
17 years, commenting that most
other small liberal arts colleges
had had several drives in this
same period.

He praised the students for the
money they had raised by find-
ing new friends of Davidson Col-
lege. He said, however, that this
campaign could have produced
still better results if there had
been someone to better organ-
ize it.

Bondurant also praised sever-
al local corporations who had
given money for the first time
to Davidson. The next report of
the progress of this drive will
be given to the Trustees at
Homecoming.

soon.

According to former chaplain
Will Terry the committee will
report to the faculty on its prog-
ress during its regular meeting
Tuesday.

This report will be followed
on Thursday by another meeting
for continued discussion, but
Terry said it is not known when
a formal proposal by the com-
mittee will be submitted.

Exhibits,
Beauties

Homecoming exhibits on a
voluntary basis were approved
by a vote of 6-3 by the Interfra-
ternity Council Tuesday night,
and the deadline for submission
of pictures of Homecoming
Queen candidates was set for
Wednesday, Oct. 19.

Any student organization may
submit a candidate with the se-
lection of the queen being made
by a faculty committee after
meeting the candidates.

Any fraternity or freshman
hall may submit a Homecoming
exhibit in competition for a $25
prize. Council members thought
that the exhibits were a “pain
in the neck,"’ but decided that
they were traditional and should
be continued.

One-way traffic will be insti-
tuted on dance and concert
weekends at the fraternity court
beginning this weekend. The
campus police will enforce this
regulation.

has expressed his desire to get
away from the idea that the pro-

simply a substitute for the old

for two years last spring.

He explained last week, “This
is an entirely new approach and

‘“T am tremendously pleased

sions Director, ‘‘but I am even
more pleased that so many of

White pointed out that the

regular visits of the admissions
officers and is not a replace-
ment for the visits.

Taking class cuts if necessary,
each student uses his own time
to travel to the high schools.

Accompanying this project is a
public relations program in
which groups of three to five stu-
dents willl discuss higher educa-
tion with students and parent
groups. Groups are selected for
their diversity, in order to get a
group of volunteers representing
a wide cross section of college
life.

This second program will be-
gin around Nov. 1, and be avail-
able to high schools in North
and South Carolina. Like the
student recruiting program, it
uses only juniors and seniors.

The public relations team is
sent to a school ‘‘to talk in gen-
eral about college opportunities,
but not specifically about David-
son,”’ according to the admis-
sions director.

Part of the emphasis in the
public relations program will
be given to military service, in-
dustrial education, considera-
tions in choosing a college, col-
lege social life and honor sys-
tems.

Saturday afternoon at 3 p.m.

“Entertainment, that is the

ing this function. Jennings said
that the hootenanny will feature
seven groups and a number of

individual contestants who will

Two dances, one square and
one rock, will be sponsored by
the College Union Social Com-

He added that the ‘“Texas-

King said that ‘‘Scottle and

At the same time, the Union
will be holding a square dance
in the parking lot behind Martin

ing that he thought a sufficient
number of similar events have
been held since school started
to satisfy student appetites.

nominal price of $1.50 and will
be served from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m.

At 8 p.m. the main event of
the weekend begins. Ian and
Sylvia, folksingers well-known
to Davidson music lovers, will
play in concert on the stage of
Love Auditorium. Appearing
here two years ago, this couple
was rated ‘‘as one of the best
concerts of the year." Vince
Foster, social council chairman,
added to this comment: “We
were really lucky to get them
. .. they have been making al-
bums recently.”

Foster advises people to ‘‘come
early to get seats in the audi-
torium.”’ Over 1,300 people are
expected to hear Ian and Syl-
via, and many may be sitting
in the aisle or on their date’s
lap.

“The fraternities are not plan-
ning parties after the concert,”
Foster said, and the combo par-
ty in the basement of Chambers
