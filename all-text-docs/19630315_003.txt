SIDELIGHTS

THINGS AND STUFF

Spring is in the air and mud is on the ground. It’s
be to look like February downpours Hing March
rains bring April showers. We hope that we've
seen the last of the ba So do the coaches who're
to get their squads ready for season openers. What better
sign of spring is there than the opening of baseball,
tennis, and — seasons on Monday? Indoor sports are
out and outdoor sports are in.

Other signs of spring are readily apparent. Ray Tur-
ner in the equipment room reports that ft baseball equi
ment has been checked out. Warm sunshine tone to
make students want to get out and do something. All
this fails to impress Turner, however. He’s been through
it all before and says a lot of them will soon be turning
their stuff back in and joining the sun bathing cult.

Graduation loses, injuries, and dropouts have de-
scended like a plague on Coach Harry Fogleman. Things
are looking so bad that with any more trouble he'll
starting his manager in the number six spot on Monday.

All coaches don’t have problems, however. Charlie
Parker has only to sit and pleasantly await the arrival of
his dream team—the 1963 U.S. Pan-American wrestling
team entry, arriving here in two weeks. Who wouldn’t
like to coach the best wrestling team in America?

The person with the longest worry list right now is
Coach Bill Dole, trying to round up his annual bunch of
scholarship boys before the April deadline. His bags are
unpacked and his traveling is done, but he’s got another
week of sitting by the phone waiting for acceptances.
Getting all his boys by the admissions board is another of
Dole’s worries—Why can’t God make all football players
smart?

Speaking of recruiting, it’s hard to believe some of
these Gargantuan Goliaths that high schools are pro-
ducing these days—probably because of the federal milk
subsid . Anyway, Coach Joe Hunt reports that on a recent
basketball trapping party, he scouted a 6’10", 290 pound
monster. It turns out that he averages thirty points a
game, too. If he comes here it might necessitate some
changes. Move Hetzel to guard and let him play the
double pivot by himself.

P.S. Warning to the ROTC supply department. He

ATHLETIC PROGRAM TOPS

Several times over the past year we have voiced our
displeasure of certain aspects of the athletic program at
Davidson and certain policies followed. By these criti-
cisms, however, never been meant to imply that we have
any basic objections to the athletic program here.

In fact, we believe that one of the most impressive
and strongest points of this college is to be found in its
athletic system. The success of our athletic program is
to be found in two particular aspects—first, the number
of students participating in the sports curriculum offer-
ed, and, second, in the closeness of the athletes and
athletic program with other aspects of the college.

More than one third of all students at Davidson earn
a letter in at least one sport and many others participate.
Also, the intramural program gives the great majority of
the student body an opportunity to join in the athletic
program. We believe this to be significant because of the
great benefits to the individual, not only physical, but in
aiding adjustment and self-confidence.

The second commendable aspect of the athletic pro-
gram at Davidson comes mainly from the fact that David-
son is a small college. For this reason, there is no separa-
tion of the athlete from the rest of school. Sports are
a more integral part of the lives of all students for this
reason—everybody knows all or almost all of the boys
playing sports, even if he himself doesn’t play. This
causes a greater integration of the athletic program into
the purposes of the school—there is a closeness, an in-
terweaving, of athletics in the life of most students.

MORE HONORS FOR FRED

We sincerely congratulate sophomore Fred Hetzel
in his recent choice as Southern Conference player of

the year in basketball. There can be little it he
earned the honor, although Rod rn is a fine ball-
layer. Hetzel now has a chance to do g even

bi great Jerry West couldn’t—win the honor three
es.

Also, congratulations to Bill Jarman on being chosen
to play in the Big Five—Carolina’s Conference Senior
All-Star game.

team opens in a four-way match with The Citadel, |

George Washington, and Furman, and baseball has the 'Cats against Pfeiffer.

Next Monday Davidson's base-
ball team opens its season here
against Pfeiffer College. This
will be the second game for
Pfeiffer, since they played Bel-
mont Abbey this week.

Coach Tom Stevens has not
decided who will start the first
game of the season. “We've just
had too few days of good weath-
er for me to make all the de-
cisions,” he said. “It's going to
be sort of an exhibition game.
I'll pitch three or four pitchers
and make a good many substitu-
tions.”

Although Pfeiffer, unlike Dav-
idson, grants some baseball
scholarships, the 'Cats have us-
ually been able to handle them.
Last year the ‘Cats took a slug-
fest, 11-9, at Davidson. The sec-
ond game had to be canceled be-
cause of rain.

The addition of Charlie Mar-
con to the catching corps seems
to have removed one of the big
“ifs” Coach Stevens enumerated
at the beginning of practice.
Marcon and letterman Eddie
Barle should handle the re
ceiver’s job adequately this year.

But there still remains: the
other “if’—how well the rich
pitching potential will shape up.
“It’s too early to tell,” says
Coach Stevens. “If Barry Teague,
Dave Johnson and Ronnie Ru-
dolph work into shape, and Tom
Hamilton and Earle Cole regain
their form of two years ago, I
can use Jim Moore in the bull
pen. That would give us a strong
staff. Anyway, we'll know by
the time we start conference
play.”

The freshman team opened
its season today against Hard-
ing High School in Charlotte.
Coach Joe Hunt is as non-com-
mital as Coach Stevens. “I can't
tell yet,” he said when asked

| how his team will do this year.

“The potential is there, so don't
worry about us,” he said.

Indoor Track Ends
At ACC Tournament

BY DENNY PHILLIPS

Sports Staff Writer

Last Saturday the tenth an-
nual ACC indoor track meet
was held at Chapel Hill. Out-
standing performance put in by
the Wildcat thinclads, running
in the non-conference part of
the tourney, was put in by Ster-
ling Martin in the two-mile run.

Martin finished second to Fur-
man’s Dennis Patterson in the
race, but nevertheless set a new
Davidson record. for the two-
mile run, both on indoor and
outdoor tracks. Martin’s time of
9:39 clipped ten seconds off the
old Davidson record.

Although 17 seconds behind
Patterson's spectacular 9:22,
Martin's time was also better
than the old meet record, and
was better than the winning
time for the ACC teams.

Sophomore Alan Turner had
trouble with the slippery floor,
but managed to tie for second
in the 70-yard low hurdles and
fourth in the 60-yard dash.

“All in all, we've had a very
fine indoor season,” said Coach
Heath Whittle. “The boys should
have a really good team this
spring. None of them has fulfill-
de his capabilities yet. Yes, it
should be a very fine track year
indeed.”

The first outdoor meet will be
held on March 27.

CONCORD, N. C.

The Dunes Golf Club in
Myrtle Beach, S. C., will host
a four-way Southern Conference
match on Monday afternoon as
the Wildcat linksters open their
season against The Citadel,
George Washington, and Fur-
man.

Team Coach Dr. Tom Scott
commented, “The Citadel and
Furman will be really good.
Both of them finished high in
the conference tournament last
year, and The Citadel has a
good chance of winning it this
year.”

All three squads boast out-
standing players. Last year's
medalist winner, Walt Smith, is
back at Furman, and Bob Haney,
co-medalist two years ago, is
heading the Indian golfers. Also,
Bill Ethridge from The Citadel
was one of the top six scorers
in last season’s tourney.

Following Monday's match,

the linksters meet George Wash- |
on;

ington again in Gastonia
Tuesday. Scott believes that the
Cats will be able to take the
Indian golfers.

Bob Bost, Jim Cooper, Frank
McPhillips, Mims Rodgers, Bill
Ross, Tom Romoda, and Mac-
key McClelland will be making
the trip to Myrtle Beach, and
Haywood Evans will join the
squad when they play in Gas-
tonia.

Scott believes that his team|0nd spot is much hotter, with victim list.

will be aided substantially by
the addition of four good sopho-
mores and should finish with a
better record than last season.
“None of the boys are great,
but we've got a solid group,”
he added.

Freshman golfers open against
Oak Ridge on May 29..Big guns
on the frosh squad should be

Howard Covington and Mac
Mcliver.
As the Word comes from

Coach Hatry Fogleman, this
year’s tennis squad faces an up-
hill fight in its matches. There
are 25 matches scheduled for
this season, and. in Fogleman's
estimation they are better than
those of previous years.

“I just hope we don’t have a
losing season,” he moans, “be-
cause then I might become dis-
agreeable.”

The team opens with Kent
State University at Davidson on
Monday. This promises to be no
easier than the rest of the year,
since Kent State is usually rank-
ed third or fourth in the Mid-
American Conference. The
weather has also put a damper
on Davidson's team, and they
have been able to practice only
four days so far.

Part of the cloudy prospects
for this year’s squad stems from
the loss of four top men from
the 1962 team. In addition, two
probable starters have dropped
out of school. Sophomores Frank
Baumgardner and Rick Reed
will be filling some shoes, and
Fogleman expects them to help
the team more as the season
progresses. Bill Schutt, tempor-
arily out with an injured knee,
will probably hit the rackets

later on.

Bob Austell returns from last
year’s team, and will hold down
the number one position. Gene
McCutchen at number two, Bill
Backlund at number four, and
John Ariail at number five
round out the squad. All have
seen service before, so inexper-
ience should not figure too
greatly as the team faces its op-
ponents.

This year's freshman team is
“real good", and should provide
talent in future years. Montanan
Dick Hurd and highly touted
Woody Cleveland have shown
considerable promise. Cleveland
will be able to demonstrate it
when the freshmen take on his
former schoolmates from Wood-
bury Forest on Monday, March

THE ONLY PLACE TO PRACTICE last Monday was in the
gym and the baseball team had to make the best of it since they Sisler (WV
open in less than a week. Here BARRY TEAGUE, only a week ,,.
back from the conference basketball tourney, gets his throwing

‘Cats Finish Fourth
In Mat Tournament

Sunday the Matmen returned
from the Southern Conference
Wrestling Tournament with a
fourth place. The conference
tournament was held at West
Virginia University in Morgan-
town as part of its Centennial
Year program.

The Citadel, Davidson, VMI,
VPI, and West Virginia com-
peted for individual and team
honors in the matches on March
8 and 9. After the finals on Sat-
urday night Davidson finished
with 24 team points, ahead of
VMI's 18.

Va. Tech won the tournament
with 73 points over W. Va. (63

=| points) and The Citadel (43
| points)

Individual conference cham
pions were as follows: 123 Ib. —
Venturino (VPI); 130 lb. — Bar-
cello (C); 137 Ib Ellerman

Independents Unbeaten
In I-F Basketball Race

As interfraternity basketball moves into its final stages, the Independents hold a
strong lead and look like a shoo-in for the championship. If they do so, it will be the
the basketball crown. With four games to go and
er top teams under their belts, they have a strong chance

of coming through undefeated.

The battle for the league sec-

‘the Phi Gams, Phi Delts, ATO’s

and Kappa Sigs making it any-
| body’s race.

The Kappa Sigs received a,

, heavy setback on Monday to

their hopes of repeating the
basketball championship this
year when the KA’s handed
them their second loss of the
season, 54-53, in a hotly con-
tested game. In the only other
close action on Monday, the
ATO’s managed to slip by the
Betas 55-53 and run their record
to 6-2.

Last night saw the Sigma Chis
score an upset over the Phi
Gams and virtually knock them
from any chance of capturing
the league championship. It was
a close battle all the way but
the Chis pulled it out, 46-46.

The Independents continued
their winning ways but not
without difficulties. Trailing the
KA's late in last night’s game
they rallied and dropped the
KA's to their fourth loss, 55-46.

The Phi Delts and Kappa Sigs
both pulled in victories, keeping
the race for the second spot as
close as ever. The Sigs romped,
53-39, over the SAE’s, and the

Walls, Joe Jones, and Bill Mills.
Tom Wright was pinned in the
| finals and took a second. Mike
| Bisard gave the Wildcats their
| best representation with his per-
|formances in the 123 Ib. slot
In the semi-finals he pinned
West Virginia’s Cain and in the
finals lost a tough match (97)

Only two members graduate
this year. Coach Parker feels
that next year’s team should be
even stronger and looks for-
ward to another Best Year.

HOW TO GET EDUCATED
ALTHOUGH ATTENDING COLLEGE

In your quest for a college degree, are you becoming a narrow: .
specialist, or are-you being educated in the broad, classical
sense of the word?

This question is being asked today by many serious observers
—including ‘my barber, my roofer, and my little dog Spot—
and it would be well to seek an answer. y

Are we becoming experts only in the confined area of our
majors, or does our knowledge range far and wide? Do we, for °
example, know who fought in the Battle of Jenkins’ Ear, or
Kant’s epistemology, or Planck's constant, or Valsalva’s maneu- -
ver, or what Wordsworth was doing ten miles above Tintern
Abbey?

If we do not, we are turning, alas, into specialists. How
then can we broaden our vistas, lengthen our horizons—be-
come, in short, educated?

Well sir, the first thing we must do is throw away our curri-
cula, Tomorrow, i of going to the same old classes, let
us try something new. Let us not think of college as a rigid
discipline, but as a kind of vast academic smorgasbord, with
ull kinds of tempting intellectual tidbits to savor. Let’s start
sampling tomorrow,

ing a spell with the R: . Then we'll go over to journalism

and tear out the front page. Then we'll go to the medical school

and autograph some casts. Then we'll go to home economies
and have lunch.

And between classes we'll smoke Marlboro Cigarettes. This,
let me emphasize, is not an added fillip to the broadening of
our education. This is an essential. To learn to live fully and
well is an important part of education, and Marlboros are an
important part of living fully and well. What « sense of com
oo will get from Marlboro’s fine tobaccos, from

farlboro’s pure filter! What flavor Marlboro delivers! Through
that immaculate filter comes flavor in full measure, flavor with-
out stint or yy atrage flavor that wrinkled care derides,
flavor holding both its sides. This triumph of the tobacconist’s
art comes to you in soft pack or Flip-Top box and can be lighted
with match, lighter, candle, Wels mantle, or by rubbing
two small Indians together.

When we have embarked on this new regimen—or, more
accurately, lack of regimen—we will soon be cultured as all
get out. When strangers accost us on the street and say, “What
was Wordsworth doing ten miles above Tintern Abbey, hey?”
we will no longer slink away in silent abashment. We will reply
loud and clear:

“As any truly educated n knows, Wordsworth, Shelley,
and Keats used to go to the Widdicombe Fair every year for
eee waiting contests and races, both of
which they enjoyed lyrically. Well sir, imagine their ‘chagrin
when they arrived at the Fair in 1776 and learned that Oliver
Cromwell, nuseey gare ay nee had just invented the

enny, had can ic ings, includi:

the Wid icombe Fair and Pall A age 80 an
that he drowned himself in a butt of y. Keats went to
London and became Charlotte Bronte. Wordsworth ran blindly
into the forest until he collapsed in a heap ten miles above
Tintern Abbey. There he lay for several years, sobbing and
his little fat legs. At length, peace returned to him. He
around, noted the beauty of the forest, and was so moved
that he wrote Joyce Kilmer’s immortal Trees... And that,
gusevenele, is what Wordsworth was doing ten miles above

Tintern Abbey.”
