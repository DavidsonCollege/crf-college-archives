Wise Trustees

The Trustee’s decision to increase the enrollment to

3,500 is one of the most progressive moves taken by the
Board fhis year.

Not only will the increase bring to Davidson stu-.

dents of all types to give the college a university atmos-
phere, but more importantly, Davidson will be hailed by
the church leaders for permitting every loyal Presby-
terian to come to Davidson.

The Davidson product will now be increased over
four-fold by this new decision. Now we can look forward

to the day when 9 out of every 10 ministers are Davidson
graduates, when 1 out of every 2 doctors is an alumnus,
and when 3 out of every 5 college graduates in the state
is a Davidson man.

For too long now. Davidson has limited its superior
production capacity to too few students. For too long
now, we have deliberately selected the best students from
the best backgrounds to fill our college. The result has
been that Davidson's graduates have done the best of all
after leaving college.

It only makes good sense that we give every student
in the state a chance to receive the Davidson diploma.

We commend the Trustees on their forthright and
wise decision.

‘men next year,

Five hundred and twenty new freshmen will enter
Davidson in September, Mr. Hengeveld, Registrar, an-

;nounced yesterday.
These 520 freshmen, an in.

crease of 270 over this year’s

class is only the first step in

the gradual increase in David-'

son's enrollment as ordered by
the Board of Trustees

“We hope to be up to 2500
students by 1960.” he said.
When asked if he thought the
number might rise even above
this, Mr. Hengeveld commented
that he could. not predict what
the Trustees might do.

However, a telephone inter-
view with Dr. C. McDowell
Richards, chairman of the Beard
of Trustees, revealed that the
Board “is still considering the
enroliment issue. We have ap-
pointed .4 committee to study
the question and‘ expect a re-
part at our next meeting.”

One prominent Trustee, who
asked not to be quoted, said
that in his opinion the Trustees
are so enthusiastic about: Da-
vidson that the enrollment will

'probably be raised to 3,500.

“We owe it to the church. to
our alumni, to our section. and
to the country to give every
qualified person the right to a
Davidson College education,” he
said,

“This tremendous increase in
prospective students demaniis
that Davidson share in the pro-
gram to give young people a
college education.”

520 Frosh To Enter College
Next Fall: Trustees Happy |

Elective courses in ROTC will
be offered next year, Col. W. L.
Adams, Jr., has announced.

“Effective immediately,
if not sooner rescinded or
superseded, all Davidson

students will have the op-
portunity to elect addition-
at courses in ROTC, the
courses being given at regu-
lar class hours and at night
by the cadre and « few out-
standing senior ROTC stu-
dents, the names of the
said courses to be desig-
nated as MS 51.52, MS 62,

MS 71-72, and ao seminar

capitalist E. H. Harriman, who
made his fortune from railroad-
ing, will arrive at Davidson on
the way north from his planta-
tion in Georgia, where he re-
cently entertained Harry Tru-
man.

Harriman, long an ardent
supporter of organized labor
and civil rights measures, will
speak on the subject, “Practical
Politics and How It Works in
the Big States.”

In commenting on his sub-
ject, Pietenpol said that the
speech should have special sig-
nificance to the young man just
out of college. He recalled, that
last, June, John F. Kennedy,
Senator from Mass., spoke at
U.S.C. on the role of the young
man in politics. Both men are
eminently - qualified, Pietenpol
said.

An honorary degree will be
given to Estes Kefauver. The
degree was originally offered
to Gov. G. Mennen “Soapy” Wil-
liams of Michigan, but he de-
clined because of a previous
commitment to speak at City
College of New York on the
same day. Kefauver will re-
ceive a L.L.D. from the Sociol-
ogy Department.

Oklahoma Added fo
1960 Grid Schedule

Oklahoma and Texas A&M
have been added to the 1960
Davidson College footbal! sched-
ule, according to athletic direc-
tor Tom Scott, who announced
yesterday that Davidson has
voted in a large scale sub-
sidization program.

The College Trustees at their
recent meeting voted to provide
for the raising of such money
that Davidson might move into
the circle of athletic powers in
this section of the country.

The addition of Oklahoma and
Texas A&M is the first step by
the scheduling committee to
achieve opponents of calibre for
the Wildcats. Coach Dole, com-
menting on the addition of these
teams, stated, “Don’t be too sur-
prised if we lose to these teams
in 1960. It may take a year or
so for us to really adapt to the
big time competition.”

The University of. Kentucky,

(SMU, and North Carolina have

agreed to begin negotiations for
joining the Davidson basketball
schedule. Plans are still incom-
plete, but Coach Scott stated
that he hopes to see Davidson
among the ton ten teams in the
country soon.

10-STORY DORM SCHEDULED

A new multi-million dollar dorm will rise above
Davidson within the next two years. The college plans
call for a ten-story skyscraper to be built on the present

site of Belk Dorm.

Mr. D. G. Martin, in an-
nouncing the new dorm, said
“We will demolish Belk
since the cigeret burns on
the floors make it unattrac-
tive to visitors. In its place
will rise the finest dormi-
tory in the Carolinas—the
new ternstory skyscraper.”
The new dorm will have both

elevators and esculators, and
each floor will have a lounge
and TV room. A cafeteria is
planned for the basement.
“This is a wonderful boost to
our plans to increase the enroll-

ment,” commented the treas-
urer,

Although a name has not been
decided upon for the new dorm,
Mr. Martin said that he thought
the Trustees would probably
name it after Davidson’s great-
est alumnus—Woodrow Wilson,
who attended college here, was
also President of Princeton
University in New Jersey, Gov-
ernor of New Jerséy, and served
for two terms as President of
the United States in Washing-
