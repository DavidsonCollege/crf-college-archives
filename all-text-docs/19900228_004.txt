potential for improvement to say that we are
truly where we need to be. I charge you to
continue the good work you havedone this year,
and to continue to address any issue which you
feel affects the live of Davidson students. I also
charge you torenew your Zeal for change, never
resting on your past achievements no matter
how great they are, and to press as hard as is
necessary in the exercise of your duty as sena-
tors and officers; that is, “to do everything you
can to make the Davidson experience the best it

canbe forallits students.” If youdothat,youcan ~

say that you have truly served your school and
the student body, and to quote Spike once more,
that you have “done the right thing.”

DIVEST, from page 1

who visited the campus last
week, Helms and others have
become convinced that Man-
dela’s release is a signal for
Americans to increase—not to
relax—economic pressure on
the South African govern-
ment.”

Smith is certain that the
main reason De Klerk decided
to free Mandela was because of
divestment and other eco-
nomic pressures,” stated
Helms. ;

Smith and Radebe inspired
Helms to revive what he say is
a “dead issue” in the SGA and
to call for the total divestment
of the college’s holdings in the
apartheid government at the
Trustees’ meeting and to re-
quest the senate’s action.
“Smith’s message was, ‘By all
means, divest now,’” Helms
said.

Need money for college next year?

Wednesday, February 28, 1990 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Junior Darry Strickland
agreed. “There’s a need not to

t complacent just because
Mandela has been released—
and to realize that there are still
people suffering.” Several
Trustees also expressed an in-
terest in the issue, according to
Helms.

Divestment will be dis-
cussed further at the Trustees’
April meeting, but no action
toward divestment has. offi-
cially been taken or agreed
upon by the Board.

A recently-elected member
of the Board of Trustees, Scott
Woodmansee, exclaimed that
the demonstration was “about
equal to some of the demon-
strations I observed here in the
60s and early 70s when I was
the college chaplain. It’s cer-
tainly a good group!” Such.an
action on the part of students
he described as “another [im-
portant] way of saying that we
don’t support racism.”

Environmental tip of the week
Intelligable, sensible, do-able and
only slightly inconvenient ideas for
the Davidson College student:

Return clothes hangers to the Davidson College Laundry for
re-use. Most of you go there every couple of weeks, so take them
with you. (Yes, ringing lightposts with hangers from 2nd and
3rd story windows is a form of re-use, but it is obviously not the
best!
