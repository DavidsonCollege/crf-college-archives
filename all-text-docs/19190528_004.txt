Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, May 28, 1919

ALUMNI NOTES

For two years the annual alumni ad-

dress before the two literary societies
has been dispensed with. But it was re-
sumed again this pring; and the socie-
ties were peculiarls foftunate in having
Dr. Walter Lingle. of Union Theologi-
cal Seminary, 10 make this annual ad-
dress on Mondin night.
In beginning, his “remarks,” as Dr.
Lingle chose tv style his address, he re-
ferred to the viet difference between the
present-day hucid nonfranti):, exposi-
tory form af speaking and the old bom-
bastic, declamatory style, when — the
preacher began his gestures to the right
hand and to the icit before he proceed-
ed into the announcement of his text.
And Dr. Lingle said that the present-
day oratory is superiog to the old form.
The old stvle had certtin glaring defects
which are omitted and more or less rem-
edied in the new style. In the first
place, the old style was too pessimistic.
And the speaker cited how he had most
scathingly denounced socialism when in
college, having read nothing of. social-
ism except its perils. And if all the
perils predicted in those Junior and
Senior speaking. had come to pass, the
old world would be “nix” today. Again,
the old style of oratory was too sad. A
maiden dubbed it aright when she whis-
pered out at the close of a very serious
oration, “The services will be continued
at the grave.” A third faultiness in the;
old oratoty was its lack of reality. Sub-
jects were chosen which seem absurd
now in the lack of relation they bore
to life. Dr. Lingle again cited a speech
of his own on the future of Constanti-
nople twenty-five years ago when such a
subject as little concerned the American
citizen as did the Sultan's harem. A
fourth fault was that it was too artifi-
cial. In those days of the good old
South a speaker could orate long and
eloquently, when he had but little to
say, and would always wax into his
greatest cloquence when he had nothing
at all to say and was not bound to a
subject.. ;

In bringing his remarks to a_ close,
Dr. Lingle pointed out that it had been
the resule of. his several years’ obsetva-
tion of excellent speakers that a good
speaker is as a rule_also a good listener.
And he said, “A man who wants to
speak well ought to become a good lis-
tener.” It is well. he pointed out, to
observe all good speakers and try to find
the secret of their success; all bad speak-
ers to avoid their pitfalls. Emulate the
successful qualities of a good speaker and
cultivate the art of being a good lis-
tener.

After this address the meeting was ad-
journed to the two literary society halls,
respectively, where diplomas were
awarded those Semors graduating from|
the societies, and where the alumni of
cach society were given a chance to re-
deem the failures ot former years and
to recount those happy days of long ago.

Hundreds of friends and alumni will
be interested in the news of the mar-
riage of Miss Thelma Lamson Russell,
of Marlboro, Mass., and Dr. ‘Douglas
Heath Nisbit, L. 5. Medical Corps, the
marriage being solemnized Wednesday
night, May 7th. at the home of the
bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Clifton
B. Russell, at Marlboro. Only  rela-
tives and intimate friends witnessed the
marriage. Miss Margaret Peach,
Marlboro, was maid of honor, and Lieut.
B. J. Berger acted as best man. Mrs.
Mildred Heath Hargrave was the only
representative of the groom’s family
present.

Dr. Nisbet and Miss Russell met in
the Boston City Hospital, he being there
as an interne, and she in training as a
nurse for overseas service.

The bride is «1 member of one of the
old families of New England, her fam-
ily being among the most prominent in
Marlboro, a delightful city of 40,000
or §0,000 people. She is pretty, charm-
ing, and talented, and was making rapid
progress in the work which she had
chosen during the war period.

Dr. Nisbet is the oldest son of Dr.
and Mrs. Walter Olin Nisbet, of Char-
‘lotte. Before coming to Davidson he
took his preparatory training at Char-
lotte University School. After gradu-
ating from Davidson he entered Har-
vard in the medical school, from which
he graduated shortly afterwards. He is
now serving at the Base Hospital at
Fort Sam Houston.

ALUMNI PARAGRAPHS.
R. M. Miller, Jr.

The standing of a College is often
judged by the character and make-up of
fts College paper or magazine.

The “Davidsonian" ‘is our College
paper—it is an asset and not a liability
and as such it deserves the fullest: en-
couragement and support of the Alumni.

Its subscription list should now carry
at least one thousand names of our
Alumni.

The staff of the paper donate their
time and fabor without compensation.
This shows a spirit of loyalty which
should be appreciated by every alumnus
of the College.

In return for this loyalty to their Al-
ma Mater, they charge the sum of
$1.25 per annum for the “Davidsonian”
—a mighty small pittance they ask us
to contribute to their success,

Subscribe to the “Davidsonian”—and
do so now for 1919-1920. Help the
boys. They deserve it and are entitled
to it.

The friends of the College everywhere
join in congratulating Dr. Martin upon
his recovery, after a severe and critical

of illness,

Rev. A. M. Fraser, D.D., of Staun-
ton, Va., is an alumnus at Davidson,
class of 1876. He has just been elected
Moderator of the General Assembly of
the Southern Presbyterian church. This
henor is the highest in the gift of the
Assembly—it is most worthily bestowed
and it will be most worthily worn.

It strikes me that a closer working
relation or union between the Board of
Trustees and the Faculty, with the
Alumni Association, would make for the
betterment of the College.

It strikes me that the very drastic re-
strictions against the social functions
and festivities of the “boys” might be
made less oppressive, if not entirely re-
moved,

The career of no young man has ever
been ruined by association with a good
woman, per contra.
has been wrecked by the lack of it.

It is still hoped that the “Alumni of

Many a young life

= a

Davidson will endow a Professorship.
The time is hardly opportune now to
inaugurate the movement, because many
of us have been called upon, during the
past two years, to contribute our limit,
to the various war emergency causes—
but, later on, it can be undertaken and
I believe carried to a successful conclu-
ston.

DR. BL R. LACY TO ATLANTA.

It is safe to say that there was no of-
ficer in the entire Allied Armies that
was better loved ér more admired by
the men than was Captain B. R. Lacy,
‘06. “Lacy is the most wonderful man
1 ever met” is the tribute paid him by
his commander, Capt. Lb. P. McLendon,

Not content with ministering to the
comfort of the fighting men behiad the
lines, tending the wounded under shell
fire, burying the dead and assisting in
other phases affecting the spiritual and
material well-being of the men of | his
organization, the young chaplain figured
in spectacular fashion in actual clashes
with the Huns,

The daring bravery shown by — the
young chaplain earned his title of “The
Fighting Parson” by which he is known
throughout the A. E. F.

Chaplain Lacy left the assistant  pas-
torate of the First Presbyterian Church
of Raleigh to enter a training school for
chaplains. At Davidson and later at
Union Seminary, his record was a bril-
liant one. He spent two years at Ox-
ford University, England. by winning
a Rhodes scholarship at Davidson,

He has accepted the pastorate of the
Central Presbyterian Church of Atlan-
ta, Ga., the largest Presbyterian Church
in that city.

Among the alumni of Davidson who
have made a name for themselves in
the world, there is one who has reached
the position which is most coveted by
soldiers, namely, holding the title of
General. This one is Brig. Gen.
George C. Barnhardt.

Gen, Barnhardt is from Norwood, N.
C., and entered Davidson in 1886, a
member of the class of 1890. While at
Davidson he received an appointment to
West Point, which he accepted.

Mr. Barnhardt received his commis-
sion as Brigadier General on the first
day of October, 1918.

TWO MORE HAVE REACHED
STEPPING OFF PLACE.

Invitations have been received —an-
nouncing the marriage of Mr. Thomas
H. Strohecker to Miss Lucia Helen
Smith, of New York, which is to take
place at the home of the bride's parents
on Riverside Drive, June tyth.

Miss Smith is a graduate of Vassar.
alo of Columbia University, and is at
present assistant professor of Chemistry
in the University. She is a young wo-
man of exceptional ability and has an
admiring range of friends in the Uni-
versity circles as well as socially, in
New York, in Detroit also, where she
formerly lived and where she and Mr.
Strohecker met.

Mr. Strohecker, after leaving David-
son, entered Roanoke College, from
which he graduated. He then entered
the National Law School in Washing-
ton City, where he took a post-graduate
course. He enlisted in the Air Motor
service when the country declared war
He is now in business at Detroit, and
will make his home there after his mar-
riage.

The Central Presbyterian Church
learns with interest of the marriage of
Miss E. E. White, daughter of Dr. and
Mrs. White, of Raleigh, N. C.. and
Rev. B. R. Lacy, Jr., the new pastor uf
the church.

Mr. and Mrs. Lacy will reacn At-
lanta the week preceding the third Tues-
day in May.

As an expression of love and good
wishes on their wedding day, the offi-
cers of the Central church sent a beau-
tiful silver service as a marriage gift—
The Atlanta Journal.

Alumni will read with interest the
above announcement, for “Ben” Lacy,
“The Fighting Parson,” is one of Da-
vidson’s most beloved alumni, belonging
to the class of 1906. He has recently
returned from France, where his brave
exploits at a chaplain earned for him
the title of “The Fighting Parson.”

“I trust that you emerged from that
deal with a clean conscience.” “Yes;
but I am rather apprehensive. My con-
science is so unusually clear that I can’t
help but feel that 1 must have got the
worst of the deal.”—Exchange.
