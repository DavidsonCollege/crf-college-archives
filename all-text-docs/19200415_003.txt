Next Friday evening at the home
of Mrs. Hamilton the officers and
committee chairmen of the Chris-
tian Endeavor will hold their
monthly meeting. Many plans for
improving the society. are to be dis-
cussed, and the committee work is
to be more highly organized.

The expert Endeavor class, taught
by J. P. Price, was not held last
week on account of the leader’s ab-
sence.

The Intermediate C. E., under the
leadership of Ed Cunningham aud
Miss Potts, is doing splendi:t work.
All the village young folk from ten
to 15 are invited to attend the meet-
ing of this group.

Next Monday night there will be
a moving picture from the U.S. P.
H. S. on the social disease menace.
It will be accompanied by a lecture
by Dr. J. W. MacConnell. The pic-
ture will be free to all-college men
and such from the village as. wish to
attend.

Dr. Martin rode to Charlotte one
day last week in his faithful (?) lit-
tle Buick “4”’—he rode back iw a
brand new Franklin.

For some time suspicion has been
rife as to the “why” of the new
building in Dr. J. M. Douglas’ back
yard—a new Buick “6.”

When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and Trust
Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to
“go to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then
a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in
touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen
. his strong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good.
