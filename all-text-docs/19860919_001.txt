Southern Conference boots Davidson

By EDWIN PAGE

On Tuesday, avidson’s
hopes to remain in the. Southern
Conference as a_non-football
playing member came to an end.
The conference athletic represen-
tatives voted 4-3 with two absten-
tions to deny Davidson’s request
to remain a member despite play-
ing football: in the Colonial
League beginning in 1987.

The vote eliminated what, up
to this point, had been Davidson’s
number one option for next sea-
son. The school had pinned much
of its hope on the idea of playing
in the Southern Conference next
year despite the football move.

Davidson athletic director Kit
Morris called the vote “something
of a blow and a dissapointment.”
He Said the school had put a lot of
energy into this option and fhat
now it was time to “take a step
back and see what else may be
available.”

Davidson still has one more
year to compete in the Southern
Conference, but. the future direc-
tion of athletics at the school is
very cloudy beyond that. Morris
declined to comment on whether
Davidson has been in contact with,
any other conferences, or even
which conferences the school
might be interested in.

However, he ‘said that inde-
pendent status would be “unnat-
tractive and unaffordable over the
long pull,” implying that David-
son must find a conference at
sore point in the near future. He

On Tuesday the Davidson fac-
ulty approved a resolution calling
for the divestment of all Davidson
assets in South Africa.

Of Davidson’s 107 full-time

and 19 part-time faculty members
about 100 voted and approved the
resolution by more than a two-to-
one margin.

surge by the tennis and baseball
teams and the proposed sports
complex have improved the situa-

“At the time that the decision
was made to move to the Co lonial
League, we had had 12 straight
losing seasons in basketball and
ten straight losing seasons in
baseball,” Morris said. “In terms

ulty was that it was making a
moral statement,” said Robert C.

Williams, dean of the faculty and -

vice president for academic af-
fairs. “While it was aware of the
various financial complexities, it
was adopting the resoltition as a
moral statement and as a request
to.the trustees to divest as quickly
as possible.:”

Religion’ professor David
Kaylor said that the. general con-
sensus of the faculty, was that it

express opinions on matters af-

fecting the institution. He sighted
athletics as an example of an area
where the faculty gives its opinion

despite having no direct control -

over athletic policy.

Kaylor said the resolution re-
flected that of the Presbyterian
Church of the United States of
America despite not mentioning

the PCUSA in the resolution. He-

said the PCUSA has exhorted its
affiliated institutions to follow a
plan of “selective, phased divest-

was a perogative of the faculty to__ment.”” ; _ 7
“If we oppose apartheid, for

a much better position than we

immediate solution, Morris be-

continue to support it directly or
indirectly is morally inconsis-
tent,” Kaylor said..“The former
strategy of working within corpo-
rations to get them to change does
not seem to have eee effective
and divestment seem

logical step.”

Williams said it was rare for a
faculty to take a stand as a corpo-
tate body on a political and moral
issue, but said the faculty’s posi-
tion was similar to that of a long
list of various institutions.

the Colonial League is a sound
one. It will be difficult for David-
son until a new conference is
found, but Morris stresses, “We
will survive.”

However, because the respon-
sibility for financial .investment
lies with the trustees and fot with

the faculty, Williams said the re-

solutions will be used as respected
input to any trustee decision.

“The faculty must réspect the
fiduciary responsibilities of the
trustees, just as the trustees re- |
spect the academic freedom of the

faculty,” he said.

Kaylor said, “No one thought
we were trying to dictate policy to
the trustees.”
