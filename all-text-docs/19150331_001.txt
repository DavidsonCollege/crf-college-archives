Manager Siaw spent last Monday

in Rock Hill completing arrangemen:.
for the hase ball game with) Wofford.
Wofford has a strong team this veary as
usual, and the Davidson team will need
the backing of every student who gan
possibly be there. “Vhe  linevup te
Davidson has not been decided upon its
set, but from the material that Coach

Fetzer has to select trom every one cat limproved much in the |

rest assured thar he wall put up the vor.
best. and the prospects tor a hotly con
tested game are good.

Maunday night at 8.30. an th aude
torium df Winthrop College. Davidsor
will meet Clemson in an intercatlegiare
debate.’ “Vhe question tor debate is:
“Resolved. “Phat toreign immigration
into the United States shautd he. turthe,
restricted by the imposition or the ki
eracy test.” “Vhe attirmative will be up
held be U.S. Alexander and C. ET.
Rowan, of Davidson, whiie the negative
will be upheld by. D. b. bolger and 1)
I. Swinehart. ‘Vhose whe have kind
consented to act as judges are Messi
S. M. Lewis and {. 1. Glenn, of Che
ter, S. C.: C. EL Spencer. of Yorkville
A. B. Lodge of Gatfney, and J. Bowen
nedv, of Clinton, S.C.

The Davidson teaur has heen working
hard far some time and the chances are
that there will be a spirited debate be-
tween the two teams. Every student
who possibly can should be there to back
up the team from Davidson.

The Southern Railway has granted a
special rate af $1.80 for the round trip
to Rock Hill and back. ‘This rate will
go. into effect Saturday. so that anv wha

wish to go down then can do sa. A spe
cial train will leave Rock Hill that
night after the debate and will came
straight through to Davidson. How-

ever, to get this special train there mus?
be a guarantee that a hundred and fifty
people will come back on it that night.
This means that about half of the stu-
dent body will have to go hefore this
train can be secured, but it is hoped that
there will he no difficulty in getting the
required number. for it is a good chance
to sec the Davidson team in real action
and also to hear the debate with Clem-
son, which will -he the first to be held
this vear. Those going will leave Dav
idson on the early morning train and
have a wait of about an hour in Char
latte before the™trein leaves for Rock
Hill. where vhe: will arrive about noon,
in ample time tor the same. It is not
certain vet just what hour the special
train will leave Rack Hill. but there
will be plenty of time to hear the debate.

nual meeting Friday night. Thev were
