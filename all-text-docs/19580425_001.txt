$400,000 GIFT

‘Dana Laboratory’ Completion
Date Set For Fall, 1959

By DICK SMITH
Davidsonian Managing Editor

Mr. Charles A. Dana, presi-
dent of the Charles A. Dana
Foundation has donated $400,-
000 to the college for use in
building a new science building
and a dormitory. The gift came
with the stipulation that the
college provide the balance
necessary for the completion of
these buildings.

“We hope,” stated Treasurer
D, Grier Martin, “to begin con-
struction on the science build-
ing by next August.” He added,
“There are no plans yet for the
new dormitory, much less a
completion date.”

The new building, to be
called the Dana Science Labor-
atories, is being designed by
A. G. Odell and Associate of
Charlotte and will provide lab-
oratory, classroom, and office
facilities for the Biology and
Physics Departments.

It will be located on the cam-
pus between the Church and
the library, and will face north.
It will be two stories high, with
a basement under half of the

Walthall Is New
Football Coach

Davidson is to get a new foot-
ball coach. Jim Walthall, thirty-
one year old graduate of the
University of West Virginia,
will arrive in September to fill
the vacancy created by George
Thompson’s resignation as back-
field coach. Thompson re-
signed to become athletic di-
rector at Kinston, North Caro-
lina.

While he was in high school,
Walthall was chosen the best

athlete in the state of West.

Virginia. In college he played
baseball, basketball, and foot-
ball and, after graduating in
1946, professional baseball in
the Washington Senators’ farm
league.

Walthall has coached the last
two years at Princeton, West
Virginia. Accompanying him to
Davidson will be his wife and
two year old son.

the Cabinet to conduct a study
of the status of the Davidson
YMCA. The study was to cover
three specific areas.

First, the Cabinet was to
make a statement of the gen-
eral purpose of a campus Chris-
tian association. The study was
to endeavor to answer the ques-
tion, “What do we desire from
a religious organization at Da-
vidson College, regardless of its
affiliations?”

As an answer to this ques-
tion the resolution stated that
“the fundamental purpose of a
campus Christian association,
regardless of affiliation, is to
bring members of the college
community to an initial and/or
fuller personal commitment to
Jesus Christ.” The resolution
then gave a list of specific du-
ties which the “Y” should en-
deavor to fulfill.

The second area of study em-
bodied an examination of
YMCA methods, materials, pro-
grams, and personnel. The ques-
tion to be faced here was this:
“Is the Davidson College YMCA
making maximum use of the
program and materials of the
inational YMCA?”

The resolution answered this
question by stating that the
campus “Y” has definitely not
made maximum use of the pro-
gram and materials of the na-
tional organization. Seven spe-
cific recommendations were
made which would correct this
fault.

The third area of study
asked: “Is there some other or-
ganization which could serve
the spiritual needs of our cam-
pus more satisfactorily than the
national YMCA?” In light of
the study, the cabinet could
find satisfactory alternatives to
affiliation with the national
YMCA. In its. report it strongly
recommended that the David-

every effort to strengthen it.

The reorganization report
recommended a number of
changes in the present YMCA
setup. Under the new setup the
“Y¥” will consist of a listed and
functioning membership, six
permanent committees with
standing memberships, five
commission chairmen, and the
four executive officers.

The committees will be: Eval-
