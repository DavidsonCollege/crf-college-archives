Davidsonians have
nad little to cheer
about as far as foot-
ball is concerned this
fall, but Pete Whittle’s
harriers have really
eome through in great
style to give Davidson
a cross country team
that stacks up with the
best in the conference.
It’s unfortunate that
cross country meets are
such that only the start
and finish can be wit-
nessed by spectators,

because when a school
has an athletic team By GORDON SCOTT

that is as strong as D. C.’s harriers, student backing would be
terrific if all of the action could be followed.

HARRIERS EQUAL TO STATE NOW?

Year after year, Maryland comes up with strong cross coun-
try teams, and this year is no exception. Right behind the Terps
are the strong N. C. State harriers who handed the Cats their
sole defeat, and that, early in year before the local runners were
in top shape. It’s interesting to speculate on the outcome of a
return meet with the State squad. because they dropped Duke
by about the same score that Davidson did last Wednesday. The
Conference Championship meet in which the Red and Black
will participate on Monday, will pit the Cats against the top
teams in the league, including the runners from State, so ‘don’t
be surprised at anything that may happen.

Although the harriers don’t have a runner this year as
strong as the inimitable Jack Grey, they have much more depth
in positions and are a much stronger squad all-around than last
year’s—which, if you remember, was no push-over in any com-
petition. Blake Bradley, who was one of the top-flight per-
formers on last year’s squad, has been little short of brilliant
in meets thus far this year. And the best part of it all is that
he seems to improve with every meet. ‘In ‘Wednesday’s win over
Duke, Blake covered the four-mile course in 21 318, the best time
of his career. But Blake wasn't the only standout.

INDIVIDUAL TIMES BETTERED

Tom Stockton, who has already shown himself to be one of
Davidson’s brightest track stars, crossed the finish line Wednes-
day with Bradley to turn in his best time to date. Dave Ander-
son arid Bob Long, the only seniors on the squad, knocked near-
ly a full minute off of their best previous time. Dick Stockton
has placed consistently among the top four Davidson men, and
Bill Lee is probably the most improved runner on the squad this
year. Two juniors, Dan McKeithen and Dick Patterson round
out Whittle’s starting group. This is the first year of varsity
running for both of these lads, but they have securely nailed
down starting berths on the squad. ‘

This afternoon, Captain Long and his men met the Game-
cocks of the University of South Carolina in Columbia. Little
is known about the U. S. C. squad, but it’s probably safe to say
that Davidson added another win to their list. The South Caro-
linians will return the meet ‘in Davidson next week, but before
then, the Southern Conference meet looms on Monday. Thus,
the. Cats will have participated in four meets in the space of
six or seven days by the time South Carolina’s Harriers leave
the campus next week.

TEAM DESERVES STUDENT SUPPORT

Just like we said, you can't follow the team around the
course, but it would certainly be fitting for the entire student
body to turn out next week to witnes, the beginning and ending
of the meet with South Carolina—if for no other reason than
to show our appreciation for the outstanding record that these
unsung athletes have posted this year. The Davidsonian sa-
lutes the Cat harriers and wishes them the best luck in the Con-
ference meet on Monday and the subsequent meet with South
Carolina. .

Lead Win Over Duk

By BILL ADAMS

“Little” Davidson’s powerful
cross-country team handed “big”
Duke’s harriers a 21-34 lacing Wed-
nesday afternoon in a Southern
Conference meet. For the amazing
Wildcats it was their fourth straight
win against a single early season
set-back,

Pacing the Wildcats in their
dazzling sprint to the tape were
Blake Bradley and Tom Stockton
who tied for top honors in the meet.
The. two Wildcats crossed the
finish line arm in arin in the excel-
lent time of 21:18,.the best time of
the year on the local track, yet they
weren’t even pressed into a closing
sprint. °

Duke got two men in for third
and fourth places, but then the
Wildcats’ team strength exerted it-
self as it has all year as Dick Stock-
ton, Dave Anderson, and Bob Long
swept fifth, sixth, and seventh
places for the Red and Black ma.
chine.

To show just how good Wednes-
day’s performance was, we only
need-to consider the fact that the
first. six men for Davidson bet-
tered their previous times, most of
them by more than a mniute.

The Duke team was a good one.
They have already beaten North
Carolina and came here expecting
another triumph, but the Wildcats
completely smashed their victory
hopes. The Durham boys started
off fast, but didn’t have the strides
to match Pete Whittle’s boys,

Coach Whittle was

he was very proud of his boys and
that they had really put out for old

Betas 6--Phi Gams 0

In a close, hard fought game the
Betas remained undefeated as they
edged the Phi Gams by a single
touchdown margin last Friday af-
ternoon. The lone touchdown was
scored by John Jervis. In the second
half the Phi Gams caught fire and
drove within a few yards of the
Beta goal time after time, but they
were never able to cross the last
white stripe.

The Campus Club failed to score
for the seventh straight game, as
the K.A.’s won a fairly easy victory

game the K.A.'s drove within the

each time failed to score. The first

Pi Kaps 6 Points, 4 First Downs;
Phi Delts 6 Points, 4 First Downs

The Pi Kaps and the Phi Delts
battled each other to a tie Tues-
day afternoon in a tensely played
game. The Phi Delts held the mar-
gin in the first half of the game in
which they did all of their scoring
while the Pi Kaps were unable to
gain even a first down. The Phi
Delts only score came as Norman
Whiteheart skirted around left end
for a T. D. The Pi Kaps however,
returned from the half time break
with a “there'll be some changes
made” attitude and proceeded to
do so. The Pi Kaps scored six
points and four first downs in the
second half to tie the score. Thre¢
of their first downs were made in
the final minutes of the game on a
spirited last minute drive. Jerry
Nall scored for. the Pi Kaps after

‘catching short flat pass from Billy

ning streak as they edged by a fight-
ing S. A. E. team’ by the unim-
pressive score of six to nothing.

The only score of the game came
after Tommy Langford faked a hand
off and then passed to Earl Smith
for twenty yards and a touchdown.
The major portion of the game was
played between the thirty-six yard
markers, neither team being able
to make consistant yardage gains.
Standouts of the afternoon for the
two teams were Monty Hill and
Louie Rogers for the S, A. E.’s, and
Earl Smith, Tommy Langford,
Chuck Elliot, and Hoskins, for the
Betas.

fighting Pikas, 4 first downs to 3.
Johany Kelton ran for two of the
first downs and passed for the oth-
ers. Merrell, Hampton, and Sellers
each proved themselves excellent

recciyers for Kelton’s passes. The
Pikas, however, gave the Sigs a run
for their money due to the expert
passing of Bill Collins and the ex-
ceptional receiving of “Coot” Du-
bose and Jack Fanjoy. One of
the most spectacular plays of the
game was in the final minutes when
Collins threw a fifty yard pass to
Dubose. The Sigs had too poten.
tial touch downs citilled back when
on two consecutive plays the re-
ceiver caught the pass outside of
the end zone. Each team played
good ball and the tension was high
on both teams throughout the game

K. A. 18S. P. E. 6

The K. A.’s showed a true fight-
ing spirit as they came back into
the game in the second half, scor-
ing three touch downs to down a
S.P.E. team which had held a six
point advantage throughout the first
half. The S.P.E.’s scored their on.
ly six pointer on a brilliant pass in-
tercepted by James Toney who took
the ball inside his own 18 yard
line and ran the entire distance be-
hind excellent blocking. The K.A.’s
were not to be outdone in this ball
game, however, as Bill Byrd be-
gan to find his receivers, Ed West
and Charlie Mitchell. On the last
play of the game, with only seconds
to go, Charlie Mitchell made a
breath taking catch of Bill Byrd’s
pass as he barely tipped it in and
scooted for the final grid marker.
Yale Greer also played an excellent
game for the S. P. E.'s

In Saturday’s game it was an.
other case of Davidson injuries and
a fired-upV MI team wreaking havoc
on a defensive team composed most-
ly of sophomores who are getting
plenty of game experience if noth-
ing else. The big offensive weapon
the Davidson team possesses did
not even play and that hurt a lot.
Rifle-armed Auburn Lambeth was
nursing some painful bruised ribs
on the side-lines as Coach Jamer-
son saved him in hopes, of better
prospects of victory in later games.

The Davidson score came on
about a I3-yard pass play from
Cliff Turner to Mott Price after
the Cats drove the hall on a sus.
tained drive most of the length of
the field. Most of the game, the
Cat offense was impotent and the
defense lacked the fire and spirit
which usually characterizes a Da-
vidson team, All in all, the D. C.
team will be much better off now
that the W&L and VMI games
are behind them and, we hope, for.
gotten. Now we can look forward
to ‘better days and better games.
