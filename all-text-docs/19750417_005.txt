Would you come back?

The only clue was that she looked like
someone my litle brother would date--

However if we do not face the fact that | probably pizza and an R-rated movie.

we made such a terrible error we will f
be doomed to committing similar :

tragedies.

Most of us will seek to blunt the
ugliness of the situation. Some will say,
“So what?” Another group will blame
everyone from Harry Truman to
Richard Nixon.

But little wisdom will be obtained g ;

from placing a screen of any type
before our eyes at this time.

Many formally. educated verbal in- J
dividuals will tell why it happens and 5

why we feel as we do now. But it would
appear far better to know what is hap-
pening than to sterilize it with in-
tellectualisms.

This seems to be an appropriate time
to feel national pain.

But I guess if I hadn’t been told that she
was a prospective student I wouldn’t
have noticed her age.

neuralgia if I’m not careful.

The question which immediately con-
ronts one--or I should say immediately
confronted me as if I have learned
anything about human nature it is that
nothing immediately confronts every
one -- in fact, most people seem to

having been confronted at all, but that
is another subject entirely—insuch an
encounter is, “‘if I had it all to do over
again, would I come to school here?”’

Hats tipify library personalities

The dedicated employees of the E.H.
Little Library circulation desk don’t
give green stamps, though we often aid
in the brownie point game.

Yet there are still those who think we
give green stamps, tap dance, hold
hoop rolling contests-- anything but look
up books for students. Those students
who use the circulation desk fall into
three camps.

1) Those in the know. They wear
white hats.

2) Those in the unknow. They look
pitiful, clutch their syllabus and cast a
hopeful eye at the time clock, which
can’t help them. Often their hat is in the
process of falling off.

3) The silent, surly type. They have
no ability to vocalize, a tendency to
slam book cards around and threaten to
beat the desk person if their book is out.
Right. They wear black hats.

| think it is about time to educate the
public in the art of the reserve desk.
There actually are third term students
who have never touched the reserve
desk catalogue, as well as one
glorious incompetent who wanted a
book but didn’t know the title, author,
call number, or even the color of the
book. The following list of do’s and
don’ts should be helpful.

1)Don’t say, “I want that book I’m
supposed to read.”’ It’s not helpful. To.
your right as you face the desk is a
éard catalogue. Use it. Write down all
the numbers (yes, even the little ones)

and hand it to the desk person. Even if
the deskperson is in your class, don’t
say, ‘‘I want that book we’re supposed
to read.’”’ It makes him feel guilty for
not studying.

- 2) Never interrupt two employees
discussing the vagrancies of IMAC
referees. Everyone needs their fun.

3) Avoid holding conventions in front
of the reserve desk. It makes the time
clock nervous, the desk person seem
lazy, and sometimes hinders fellow

students from reaching the desk.

4) Don’t saunter up and say, “I want
vertical file 4+. Identify your professor
or you might be surprised and receive,
“A Critical Study of African Swamp
Grass, In the Eyes of a Poetry Critic,
an Economist and a Beach Bum.”

5) If your book is not in the card
catalogue, it is not on reserve. The
library employees gave up eating reser-
ve cards a long time ago.

6) Don’t hand. a deskperson a list of
books to find ‘‘just to see if they’re on
reserve.’’ No one appreciates sadism.

7) Never tempt the wit of a desk-
person too far, such as saying, ‘‘Can I
have the Holy Roman Empire?” You
leave yourself wide open.

8) If your professor consistently puts
too few copies. of an assignment on
reserve, it is not the deskperson’s fault.
Please delete all expletives.

9) Yes, we give change for bills under
one hundred, and the Xerox will also
give you change for dimes and quar-
ters.

10) Never be too afraid to ask:
questions. We may look important,- but
we’re actually just like you.

Thank you for shopping E.H. Little!

If anyone cares, I did not mean to call
Harvard a lesbian -of the American
regime. I actually wrote, ‘‘The last
bastion of the ancient regime.’”’ Be-
tween pen and printer, many perver-
sions can occur.

As

and creative responses to such a query,
I find it a peculiarly preposterous
question. Of course I would.

All my friends are here, my life has
been shaped--good or bad-by this place,

_ and my perceptions. and attitudes have

been so molded by Davidsoniana-
whatever the hell that is--that it seems
absurd to speculate about the alteration
of relatively recent reality.

‘Unfortunately, having allowed sim-
ple, innocent musing to metamor-
phosize into serious reflection, I found
myself confronted - I seem to do that a

dot lately- with a larger question, and

beckoned by some strange journalistic
urge to pursue the matter.

Role of alumni

One of the things that this place
prides itself on is the role that its alum-
ni play in recruiting new students. Con-
sequently as if to instill the practice
early on, the admissions office has in
the past encouraged the student body to
spend their vacations searching out
local prospective innocents and giving
them the hard sell-or frank opinion, if
you prefer.

Thus the dual experience of meeting
just such a prospective student right
here on campus, and the stark
realization that God and the Religion
department willing I will in fact soon be
an “alumnus”, causes me to ask
myself if I should, or would recommend
this place to anybody.

My mind drifts back. Actually I
wasn’t very nervous. After all I had
had a year of college already, so this
shouldn’t be such an intimidating place.

ote

Yet suave and sophisticated as I tried.
to be, confident in the knowledge that a
transfer was an entirely. different
creature than a would-be freshperson
(actually they were freshmen in those
days), it was a truly unique expeience
to visit this place.

That war of nerves that one fights to
try and not appear to be a visitor, but to
blend in when one is so conspicuous—a
condition which I must admit I have ob-
served with great glee from the other
side since that time-was in my case,
ended not by a blunder on my part, but
by the fact that an accompanying
friend had the presence of mind to
carry a catalogue about the campus.

The battle lost, we were actually ap-
proached by some members of that

Publication crisis reveals deeper issue

To the Editor: :

‘Your article entitled ‘Perish and
Publish: The dilemma of. college

publications’ may have shed light on

more than just the problems of Buck
Lawrimore and Company. The article
actually revealed the problem in the
Davidson College administration with

the exception of one man, Academic.

Vice President*John Bevan.

For some reason Dr. Bevan doesn’t
have the problem that the rest of the
administration seems to have— not
telling it like it is. Whether the issue be
the guest house, or the yearbook, the
students never get an accurate: and
completely honest answer from the ad-
ministration. —

In the article to which I am referring,
Dr. Bevan said, “‘The Update is a P.R.
piece designed to place Davidson in the
best light.’’ I do not agree with Dr.
Bevan that the Update should -do this,
but I respect and appreciate his honest
‘evaluation of the paper.

What drives me ‘“‘up the wall’ is that

Buck Lawrimore can say ‘I don’t see
the Update as a ‘good news only’
publication, but fortunately, most of
what we’ve had to print is good news.”

Can Mr. Lawrimore be serious? If he
is, then he must be incompetent, and I
can assure students from my dealings
with the administration that those who
are incompetent are far and few bet-
ween.

No, Mr. Lawrimore is far from in-
competent because the Update master-
fully does what it’s supposed to do and
that is to present’ the calm while the
storm is raging.

_For example, while our alumni were
delighted to read: that Davidson was
number one in art in the Update, I
seriously doubt that many alumni or
students realize that Herb. Jackson has
rightfully threatened to close the show

next year unless he receives better |

facilities in 1976. ‘

The point of this letter is not to
chastise Earl Lawrimore, but rather to
point out that the administration need
not present less than the whole truth.

Students are mature enough to accept
unpopular decisions. No one can accept
less than the whole truth.

If the administration wants the Up-
date to be the school propaganda
tabloid, if they resent nudity in the
yearbook, and if they want to make the
Carnegie Building into the guest house
again then so be it. But just do what Dr.
Bevan does and tell us. THANKS!

To the Editor:

In regard to a recent article in which
Mr. Augustus Succop cast most
despicable (and unfounded) aspersions
upon the honor of the Eumenean

Society, to wit: ‘‘No one is proud to be .

a member of the Eumenean Society,” I
wish to take issue. 4

Not only do I take great pride in my
membership, I feel quite confident in
stating that I speak for the remainder
of the society as well.

I might add that we have no need of

formal regalia in order tq .,ensure .

feelings of maturity and _ intellectual
ability, and furthermore we are not
so unsure of our identity as to be forced
to discriminate against a quite respec-
table, and, if we may believe represen-.
tatives of the admissions’ office, in-
tellectually superior segment of the
Davidson community.

On behalf of the Society, I welcome

any reply.
