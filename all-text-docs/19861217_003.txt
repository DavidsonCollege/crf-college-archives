Belov brings Russia to life at Davidson

By AARON LEVINE -

One of the new faces on the
Davidson campus this term is that
of Mrs. Fania Belov, a native Rus-
sian who is teaching an introduc-
tory Russian course this. winter.

Mrs. Belov, originally from
Moscow and now living in
Winston-Salem, has taught Rus-
sian to English-speaking students
for several years after leaving the
Soviet Union in 1981. Mrs. Belov
is an actor by trade. Her method of
teaching Russian draws on this
background.

In class, for the first couple of
weeks, she: gives out situations
and the students act them out.
These situations are from every-
day life and eventually the stu-

dents feel free and natural’ in.

speaking.
For now, there is no alphabet
to learn, no reading. These things

cannot be considered until one has
mastered speaking. Belov feels
her students have been doing quite
well.

_Overcoming insecurity is an_

important part of the class. Belov
said, “With language, music and
so forth we feel insecure . . . so
we need to tnust the teacher. To do
so, we create a situation where
one can express him or herself
naturally ... This eases insec-
urity.”

Belov went on to say this i in-
security can cause misunderstand-
ing and mistrust. The best way to
create an understanding between
two cultures is for mutual under-
standing of the languages of other
cultures.

She hopes that the knowledge
her students gain will help them to
better understand the U.S.S.R. In

her eyes, the problem between
America and the Soviet Union is
one of a lack of communication
resulting in a lack of understand-

ing. One thing she—complains-

about is the misinformation both
countries have of each other.

Belov is enthusiastic about her
teaching and would like to teach
an intermediate level course in the
spring. She would especially like
to see an eventual full scale Rus-
sian studies program.

Dean of Faculty Robert Wil-
liams stated that a full Russian and
Soviet Studies program is feasi-
ble. Four professors: Louis
Ortmayer and Jack Perry in politi-
cal science, and Earl Edmondson
and Williams himself in history,
have the necessary background to
be with such a program. All that is
needed is a full-time professor of

Russian language and literature. If
a program does formulate, it
would be a concentration and not a
major. —--

Belov graduated from the
Moscow State Academy School
of Circus and Variety Arts in
1970,. and has appeared with
dramatic groups such as the Mos-
cow State Music Hall Theater and
the Moscow Clown and Pan-
tomine Theater. For a number of
years now she has been an interna-
tionally known actress, clown,
and stand-up comedian. She had
her own radio and _ television
shows in the U.S.S.R., and since
in America has appeared on
“P.M. Magazine” and “Captain
Kangaroo.”

As to why she and her acting
husband left the Soviet Union, she
says: “We were well-known pro-

Phonathon’s 149,000 effort is a success’

By GEORGE KURANI

Over 400 students participated
in the annual Phonathon to benefit
Davidson’s Annual Fund Dec. 1-
11. In what has been called an ex-
tremely successful service pro-
ject, the students raised over
$149,000 for the school.

The majority of the work in
the phonathon came through the
calling of Davidson alumni and
parents of students currently en-
rolled.

Before starting to make the
calls, all volunteers were given a
half-hour training session that
gave pointers on how to approach
the person being asked to donate.
From 7:00-9:45 p.m., freshmen
and members from every house on

The three student chairmen
were: junior David Handy, senior

chairmen were chosen and trained
by these three.

“I think that the Phonathon
went incredibly well,” said
Handy. “We raised an impréssive
amount of donations through the
hard work and commitment put in
by all students who worked with |
us.’

this year compared to previous

‘years is a reflection of the stu-

dents’ commitment to raising
money for the school,” she con-

tinued. “Also, it makes it easier .

for all of us that many people
enjoy speaking with a Davidson
student since they can ask ques-
tions about how the college is
doing.”

Gracia Slater, director of the
living endowment, and Hunter
Roddey, living endowment assis-
tant, organized and prepared for
~— the students when they came to
work on the Phonathon project.

Roddey said that the

Phonathon has raised more than
$149,000, not counting people

wo

that said they would contribute in
the future. Roddey said that this
usually brings in several thousand
dollars more.

“Since we had already raised
more i ghey. for the Annual Fund
than in previous years,” said Rod-
dey, “we had expected not to raise
as much during the Phonathon.
But the students ‘really turned it
around by working so hard and
bringing in new students every
night. It made things exciting for
us,”. he continued. “Things
couldn’t havé gone any better.”

Part of the reason that the
Phonathon did so well could be a
result of the competitive spirit
taised between Patterson Court
houses. Many houses cancelled

\fter the two had decided to
apply for exit visas from the
Soviet Union, life suddenly got
difficult for them — they lost
there jobs, their names were re-
moved from the programs, and
their pay was cut.

In this country, both Belovs
are associated with the North
Carolina School for the Arts in
Winston-Salem. She currently
teaches acting and clowning at its
School of Drama. Not too long
ago, she began to teach Russian
privately in her home. A former
student of hers recommended her
to Davidson, and eventually she
was contacted by the director of
Center for Special Studies, Dr.
John Brockway.

people, according to organizers,
to work every phone. In the final
tally, the two houses with the -
largest totals were SAE, which |
finished first, and KA, finishing
in second place. Both houses
raised over $26,000.

All of the money raised by the

Phonathon will go into the Annual
Fund, which supplies the financial
support for running the college.
The Annual Fund contributes to
three main organizations: the Liv-
ing Endowment, the Wildcat
Club, and WDAV. While the stu-
dents’ tuition supplies 60 percent
of the money needed to support
the .college, the Annual Fund
gives the rest.
