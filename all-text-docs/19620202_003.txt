TROUBLE AT WILLIAM & MARY

It seems that all is not well in the wonderful world
of Sports at William & Mary this year. According to Bill
Brill, sports editor of The Roanoke Times, the Indians’
head basketball coach, Bill Chambers, may be looking for
a new job at the end of the current season.

Indian fans are very unhappy about this season’s|

5-11 record, and the most dissatisfied of them all is

Milton Drewer, the school’s Athletic Director. According |
to editor Brill, Drewer and Chambers get along with each |

other about as well as a couple of gamecocks armed with
spurs and all. Drewer criticizes Chambers’ recruiting
policies, and Chambers blames a lack of scholarships and
the poor basketball facilities at W&M. (The Indians’ home
court, old Blow Gymnasium, is renowned as the worst in
the conference.)

Editor Brill seems to favor Drewer in the argument
and uses Lefty Driesell as his example of a hustling coach
who can get the job done despite handicaps. The follow-
ing paragraphs were in Brill’s column last Sunday:

Davidson’s facilities are no better than W & Ms,
and its more difficult to get a boy into Davidson be-
cause of the extremely high academic standards.

Yet Davidson has the best freshman team in the
conference, a tribute to the hustle of coach Lefty
Driesell. Virginia Tech coach Chuck Noe, who doesn‘t
count himself among the Driesell admirers, admits
that the Davidson coach did a fine recruiting job.

“Vl say this for Driesell,” said Noe. “He really
went out and scratched, and he brought in some good
boys. Davidson will be real tough next year.”

We appreciate the compliment, Mr. Noe, but you
might be interested to know that Davidson is tough this
year. Noe may not know it, but the Wildcats have won
ten straight ball games, and are rated as the conference
dark horse.

Getting back to the William & Mary trouble, we
don’t see that Drewer has the right to criticize anybody.
He also serves as head football coach, and in five seasons
his grid troops have. compiled a dismal 13-35-1 record.
This year the Indians finished in the league cellar with
a 1-9 record.

A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

The recent announcement that Wildcat squads will
play Princeton in basketball, and possibly Virginia in
football next season provides a real challenge for all of
those connected with athletics at Davidson.

We approve very much of this action taken by Dr
Scott and the athletic committee, which draws up our
sports schedules. We feel that this action is a step in the

right direction, and is indeed a shot in the arm to OUr| of the sea,

schools is excellent for the prestige of Davidson.

Both Bill Dole and Lefty Driesell are looking forward
to the challenge, but both men realize that their players
and themselves are going to have to give 100 per cent
effort at all times to perform the rigorous tasks which
face them next season. Next year may very well prove
whether or not Davidson College has the right to compete
on a big time basis.

YOU'RE ON THE AIR, DAVIDSON

Davidson publicity director Taylor Blackwell an-
nounced that radio station WCGC in Belmont is planning
to broadcast several remaining Wildcat basketball games.
The station carried last night’s Erskine game, and plans
to broadcast the Richmond and Furman games (both
away) back to area fans.

Blackwell said that WCGC has become very interest-
ed in the basketball situation at Davidson, and it may
carry many of the Wildcat contests over the air next

season.

Hunt’s men enjoyed a mere 37- |

The Baby Deacs closed this |

got the lead as the ’Kittens went |
on another rampage to put the
game on ice.

As the final buzzer sounded,
icing was added to the cake as
Charlie Marcon’s arching omer: |
head push shot from the far |
corner swished through the nets
to write the final victory margin
at 25 points.

Tommy White turned in one
of his best performances of the
year, as he rebounded well and
pumped in 8 vital points. Paul
Briggs also did a good job, as he
continued to show an excellent
eye from the free throw line.
Barry Teague was forced to sit
out the game due to a sprained
ankle sustained in the Oak

Georgia Visits
Davidson Pool

A busy schedule awaits the Davidson mermen, who
now hold a 2-1 record following a close defeat at the
hands of VPI, 52-43.

Coach Dwight Shoe’s men be-
gin the after-exam splash to-
morrow afternoon by playing
host to a very tough team from
the University of Georgia, which
holds victories over Alabama,
Georgia Tech, and VPI. The
Bulldogs are led by Rolfe Pink-
erton, a sprinter, and Charlie
Gentry, who could be a stand
out in almost any event.

On Monday, February 5, the
Catfish travel to Charleston in
hopes of dunking a relatively
strong Citadel team, which has
some fine swimmers including

the conference title.

The following Davidson swim-
mers scored points in the VPI
meet just prior to exams:

220 freestyle—Oarter Mebane

200 medley—Tom French (2nd)

Parker siated that the trip
would be, in effect, “a journey

he had little or no information

Parker did, however, reveal

that he expected Georgia to be
a lot tougher than Emory, since

Number ten came last night

COLD ‘CATS
Cold as the weather outside

in the first half, the ‘Cats hit
only 9 field goals in 34 attempts
for a poor 26.2 per cent. Taking
advantage of the usually hot
Davidson shooters’ cold — spell,
the Flying Fleet tossed in 50
per cent of its shots, and went to
the dressing room with a 29-29
tie with the favored Wildcats

However, Coach Lefty Driesell
warmed his men up during in-
termission with a heated ver-
bal lashing, and the red and
white clad cagers returned to
the floor with no intentions of
being denied their tenth conse-
cutive win. Gunning in 52 per
cent of its second half shots,
Davidson brought its overall
percentage for the night up to
37.3.

Haywood Evans (6), Danny Car-

Howard Arbuckle (2).

Beerman continued to show
tremendous improvement, and
the 64 sophomore from Pitts
burgh, Pa., gave every indica-
tion that he is ready for 40 min-
utes of action each game. Be-
sides pumping in 15 points, he
pulled down 7 rebounds.

Jarman and Martin were top
rebounders with 11 each, while
Holland garnered 10. The ‘Cats

CONFERENCE FOES

This afternoon the squad left
for a three day trip to Virginia,
where they will meet Southern
Conference foes William & Mary
and Richmond. Thus the ‘Cats
get a chance to improve on
their 2-3 conference record as
well as a chance to continue
their winning streak. Double
victories on this road trip would
probably soar them -to a sky-
seraping third place in confer-
ence standings.

Driesell and his men are a-
ware of the dangers that con-
front them on this trip. Tomor-
row night's opponent, William &
Mary, has won 5 out of 6 home
games this season, the only loss
being to VPI. The Indians have
