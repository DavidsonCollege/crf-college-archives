As our semester as editors comes to a
close, it’s only fitting that we take this time to
thank the many people who contributed to the
production of these past ten newspapers.

First and foremost, our heartfelt grati-
tude goes out to Ben Covington. His tremen-
dous devotion, unyielding perseverance, and
continual patience were invaluable over this
semester. Ben brought unprecedented tech-
nical prowess to The Davidsonian—he laid
out practically every column inch of the news-
paper this spring, and his creative touch de-
livered the new flag atop the front page of the
newspaper. More than any other individual,
the production of The Davidsonian was con-
tingent upon his services.

Similarly, Cader Howard deserves lim-
itless applause for his efforts. A constant
source of energy and enthusiasm, Cader’s
presence made 4 AM work-nights not just
bearable, but enjoyable. Cader and Ben
created some fabulous graphics—from the

“Changing Lanes” track photo to superim- ’

posing images of the new Knobloch Campus
Center.

The next round of thanks goes out to the
section editors. These individuals worked
the trenches all semester—keeping abreast of
campus happenings, managing staffs of writ-
ers, editing every week, and often accepting
the burden of writing last-minute stories.

So long,

VIE)

Their jobs spanned every day of every week
this semester,

Seth Davis and Ann Gregory contrib-
uted to as fine a News section as The
Davidsonian has seen in recent years. They
managed a scope of stories that scratched
beneath the surface, probing into pertinent
and relevant issues.

Roshan Paul, too, set a standard as the
first editor of The Davidsonian’s Interna-
tional Commentary section. Answering the
call to help bridge the gap between the pro-
verbial bubble of

‘arewell

At the back of the paper, Burgin Hardin
was the picture of dedication and creativity. :
He lifted the sports section to sights unseen,
combining a breadth and depth of coverage
that highlighted the wondrous athletic en-
deavors that Davidson students embark on.
Burgin synchronized the efforts of the largest
staff of any section of the newspaper—and
unilaterally built, refined, and polished that
section each and every week.

Another new face of The Davidsonian
this semester was the Features section. Car-

rie Riley took on the

Davidson College
and the world at
large, Roshan man-
aged this section with
patience and profes-
sionalism—juggling
the heated debates that often stewed beneath
the text of these stories.

Erica Schwartz presided over a flurry
of campus discussions in the pages of our
newly-renamed Viewpoint section. She deftly
coordinated the various voices and views that
were presented as our campus struggled with
matters extending from the Honor Code to
cable television—and broughta voice of pro-
fessionalism, sensibility, and lighthearted-
ness to our editorial board meetings.

Students find bulletin board offensive

Posted ona bulletin board between room
334 and Dr. Barnes’s office in Chambers are
several items deprecating various aspects of
Catholicism. This board makes no attempt to

' engage the viewer in a consideration of is-
sues. We believe that it either is meant to be
disparaging towards Catholics, or it’s sup-
posed tobe funny. If the latter is the case, we

‘don’t get it.

Our first clue that this bulletin board
does not seek to be objective is what appears
to be a setof Reformation-era woodcuts. One
shows people flatulating in the face of the
Pope, another shows people defecating on his
crown, anda third shows him being born of
the anti-Christ. This Reforma-
tion propaganda is anachronis-
tic and seems irrelevant to con-
temporary issues.

One newspaper clipping is
a photograph taken at a recent
mass for St. Therese. The cap-
tion explains that her remains
were at the church for this mass,
and a quip penned on exclaims,
“Holy Bones!’ We’ re not sure why someone
would mock the idea of honoring the dead in

this way. Many Jews bring the bones of their —

families to Israel. People of all traditions tend
and visit the places where the remains of their
loved ones are located. When a loved one dies
in an accident or abroad, family members
want to recover the body. People visit the
graves of strangers who have influenced them,
for example John F. Kennedy.

A copy of another newspaper article is
posted with several very large exclamation
points marked on it. The article is entitled,
“Pope expands indulgences for 2000 feast.”
The name of the newspaper from which this
article was clipped is absent. However, the

typestyle is identical to that of The Charlotte
Observer. This article was condensed from
the New York Times; however, significant
portions have been removed such that the
meaning of the original article has been
warped. Context clues suggest that this bul-
letin board is maintained by a faculty member

in the History Department. A history profes--

sor should know that in consulting docu-
ments, one should preferably refer to the
original source. When using reprinted/con-
densed sources, the source should be cited.

October 31, 1999, the Catholic and
Lutheran Churches essentially resolved the
doctrinal dispute which was in large part
responsible for the Reforma-
tion by signing an accord,
which held that justification
comes through the grace of
God through faith in Jesus
Christ. We find it ironic and
disconcerting that this board
advocates division and dis-
sention among Christians
based on erroneous beliefs
and innaccurate stereotypes at a time when
the leaders of the Catholic Church and the
Lutheran. World Federation have made sub-
stantive moves towards ecumenism.

Evidently, the person/s maintaining this
bulletin board has/have a bone to pick (ex-
cuse the pun) with Catholics. We believe that
dissenting opinions are essential and valu-
able to any public discourse; however, we do
not believe that these postings promote an
honest discussion of the issues related to
Catholicism.

formidable task of
trailblazing this new
segment, highlight-
ing issues ranging
from the Honor Code
to Religion and Spiri-
tuality on campus.

Thanks also to Anna Erickson, who
arrived without fail every Tuesday night to
copy edit each page of The Davidsonian. On
the business end, Peter Clark and David
Johnston were spectacular in their roles as
business and advertising managers. Their
efforts brought in the vast majority of the
funds that fueled The Davidsonian—and start-
ing in January, they righted a budget that was
projected to fall thousands of dollars into the
red. Thanks to their dedicated ad solicitation
and shrewd business planning, they rounded
out the year with a surplus in The
Davidsonian’s ATC budget.

We also need thank the Dean Rusk pro-

_ gram and the Student Government Associa-

tion for contributing $1200 so that we could
purchase rights to Associated Press news
stories. This purchase brought another di-
mension to the newspaper.

Cindy Clark and Ina Spechar and their
distribution staff—Matt West, Jeff
Goldman, David Moncure, Rebecca
Stewart, Amber Worrell, Mary Ann

Loman, Jordon Steele—“walked the beats,”
delivering The Davidsonians to your door-
step each week and managing off-campus
subscriptions and circulation. Stephen
Gamboa graciously volunteered his talent,
catapulting The Davidsonian into cyber-space
each and every week.

There are a vast array of people who
deserve thanks for helping us get ourselves
off the ground this semester. Editors emeri-
tus Wes Goldsberry and Michael Kruse
were exceptionally instrumental in preparing
us for the daunting task of producing The
Davidsonian. Also invaluable was the advice
and guidance of Ferrel Guillory—this year’s
Batton Professor, and a former editorial page
editor of the Raleigh News & Observer. Mr.
Guillory offered
continuing advice
and guidance from
day one, and we
graciously thank
him for his com-
mitment.

The unsung
heroes of The Davidsonian, though, are the
countless staff writers.that contributed their’
energies and invested so much heart and time
into their stories. Two of them, Richard
Vinson and Aaron Houck will be assuming
the roles of editors-in-chief come this fall.
They promise to bring a fresh look, a passion
for their work, and limitless energy to this
endeavor, and we wish them the best of luck.

The problem with naming names is that
we inevitably will leave someone out. We'll
apologize in advance, and if it’s any consola-
tion—that omission was the final mistak we
ever make as editors-in-chef of the nation’s
foremust colege weeekly.
