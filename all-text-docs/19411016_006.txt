The Frosh

The frosh eleven which looks like one of the best in Davidson's
history plays again this week-end, tomorrow in fact, but its at Mars Hill,
and this time against a Junior .College rather than a freshman ‘crew.
Without doubt the Kittens looked good against Wofford, but the ques-
tion still remains just how much was good and how much was Wofford.
Mars Hill should be more of a test, and if they come through again,
all four teams of them, it'll begin to look real. Undoubtedly they're more
of them than in any previous class, undoubtedly they've got a good first
team; but in modern football, counting must go beyond eleven men, and

its there that the question about the strength of the frosh eleven really
lies.

The Tigers scored in the first few

straight passes from Logue to Smith

Cats Theaten

The Wildcats made a serious
threat in every quarter but either
a fumble or an inspired Sewanee
defense halted the Cats while still
away from paying territory.

Bethea Fumbles

Davidson maneuvered the ball to
the Tiger's 26 in the opening period,
but Red Bethea’s fumble was re-
covered by a Sewanee lineman, In
the second quarter the ball was lost
on a fumble by Johnny. Frederick's

in the third period after Davidson
had moved the pig skin to the Se-
wanece twenty yard line.

Receive, Kickoff

The Wildcats received the kick-
off in the fourth period after the
Sewanee touchdown and began a
series of offense threats that kept
the fans on their feet, but were un-
able to push across a touchdown to
make it three out of four ties. The
game ended with Davidson in pos-

Duke, Clemson

Tied For Lead

As the 1941 football season ap-
proaches its midway mark, Clemson,
conference champions last year, and

Duke's mighty Blue Devils, are
dominating the Southern Conference
leadership.

Clemson gained distinction this

past week by trouncing Boston Col-
lege 26-13, whereas Duke, scoring
almost at will, swamped the Uni-
versity of Maryland 50-0.
Three Unbeaten

Within the conference race, Clem-
son, Duke, and William and Mary
have unblemished records. Clemson
and Duke have two wins while Wil-
liam and Mary has only one.

Wake Forest, North Carolina,
North Carolina State, Davidson,
Furman, Maryland, V. M. I., V. P. I,
and Richmond have been beaten in
the conference. South Carolina,
George Washington, and Washing-
ton and Lee have been tied in the
