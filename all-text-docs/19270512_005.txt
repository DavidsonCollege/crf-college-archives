INSPIRING MOTHER’S DAY

(Continued from page 1)

Self sacrifice is a very striking charac-
teristic of all true mothers everywhere in all
times. Moses’ mother then did not and our
mothers now do not complain overbearing
burdens but rather rejoice in them. To be
worthy of this attitude ntedern youth must
change from its selfishness and cease as-

phyxiating mothers from lack of “Apprecia-
tion.
Courage and pluck are other qualities

found in the mothers of the human race.
Going into the valley of the shadow requires
more courage than that exhibited on any
gridiron or battlefield.

The speaker here paid his respects to the
flapper type of mother who is today crowd-
ing the divorce courts. Such women should
-be allowed to rear nothing but cats and
dogs, for the worth while qualities of wom-
anhood are lacking in them.

As a final tribute the speaker declared
that mothers have more influence in the
world than any other factor. The mothers
of tomorrow must he protected and safe-
guarded today if the future happiness and
well being of the race is to be insured.

FORENSIC OFFICIALS

(Continued from page 1)
Contrary to the method used this year
in selecting the debates for each debate
by having try-outs just before the debate,
next year the majority pf the preliminaries
will be held before the Christmas holidays.

The debating “season” next year will prob-|’

ably last from the first of March until. the
WSth of April.
