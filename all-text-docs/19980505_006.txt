A recent article in the Charlotte
Observer revealed that Davidson Col-
lege was the only area institution that
had no scheduled commencement
speaker. College leaders. took action
toward rectifying this embarassing situ-
ation over the weekend, inviting per-
forming artist Wesley Willis to speak at
graduation on May 17. Willis report-
edly accepted the gig late yesterday
afternoon.

According to the Observer, even
UNC-Pembroke managed to land a
speaker as impressive as Bill Cosby,
former star of NBC’s “The Cosby
Show” and voice of Fat Albert. The
administration, eager to keep pace with
one of North Carolina’s lowliest insti-

Wesley

tutions, sought to continue Pembroke’s
trend. “We contacted Prince, Doug E.
Doug, and Tone Loc, but they were all
booked solid. Then we found Wesley.
We feel that Mr. Willis will lend an air
of jocularity to the ceremony, an air that
Davidson so often lacks. It’ll be a great
day for the college.”

In a recent interview with the
Davidphonian, Willis abounded with
enthusiasm and praise for the college.
“Davidson College is bad to the max,”
Wesley said. “Those students are some
educated rappers. They can really rap
their asses off. They can really knock it
out. They can really whup a horse’s
ass.”

Willis, who stands 6’5” tall and is
diagnosed chronic schizophrenic, be-
gan writing songs in 1992, Perhaps
because all of his songs are scored for

solo voice and Casio keyboard and all
sound exactly alike, he has been able to
record at least 400 songs and 20 albums
on the Alternative Tentacles label and
others. Among his most famous works
include “I Wupped Batman’s Ass,”
“Jesus is the Answer,” “Rock Saddam
Hussein’s Ass,” “I’m Sorry that I Got
Fat,” and “Rock n Roll McDonald’s.”

This year’s commencement prom-
ises to be Davidson’s most invigorat-
ing. ‘As long as the voices in my head
don’t talk to me vulgar,” Wesley said,
“the jam session will be excellent. The
rock and roll will be perfect. My speech
will really whup a snow leopard’s ass.”

Inatrademark closing plug, Willis
stated, “Rock over London, rock on
Chicago — The Davidphonian! It’s
‘The Nation’s Third Worst College
Weekly!”

The state of the bathrooms

To begin, I want to explain that I
am a vindictive person. Make me mad,
watch your back. And I know that Iam
far from being the only person on this
campus who proudly possesses this
characteristic. I have been the unfortu-
nate victim of many a vengeful act,
varying in degrees of seriousness and
originality on the avenger’s part.

Vengeful acts are plentiful here.

Since I’ ve arrived, I’ ve heard of a
few tricks. For example, there’s the
classic silent treatment or badmouthing
of an individual who has made you
mad. Disgusting examples, such as
peeing on a person’s pillowcase or rig-
ging a huge bucket of water outside
another’s door for a cheery morning
wake-upsurprise, have certainly proved
to be interesting and entertaining sto-
ries. But another spiteful action exists
on this campus. Unfortunately, only
those living in dorms are capable of
using ‘its full potential. But being a
lucky member of the dorming situation,
I have both suffered from and caused
this simple pleasure. Itis, plainly stated,
the wonderful repercussions of toilet

flushing. ;

I'll grant you that not only does
toilet flushing seem ridiculous, random,
and utterly harmless for our environ-
ment, it doesn’t appear to accomplish
anything. This is where you, my igno-
rant reader, are horribly mistaken. Any-
one who has showered in a dorm bath-
room knows that toilet flushing is a
humorous retort for anyone who has
mildly offended you. (Serious offend-
ers can stop reading here and refer to the
previously discussed. “disgusting ex-
amples” or go off in search of inspira-
tion elsewhere. I am not writing to
initiate out-and-out war.) The sudden
burst of scalding water amidst the pre-
viously pleasant temperature is an aw-
ful shock for the unwary.

Timing is everything. In order to
accomplish the seemingly harmless act
successfully, youmust be confident that
your victim-is the only person currently
showering in the bathroom. Simply
walking into a bathroom and randomly
flushing does nothing to your object of
anger. Patience is definitely required.
Also, you must be certain that your
potential victim is comfortable in ‘the
shower. If the person is male, assume
that the second the water hits his skin,

he is comfortable. If the person is
female, give her 10 to 20 seconds, to be
safe. Next, feel free to position yourself
in an empty stall and begin flushing.
The first flushings shouldn’t yield high
satisfaction, as the person will suffer
silently, assuming that it is simply an
innocent mistake. Each flushing, how-
ever, will increase satisfaction for you,
while sharpening the suspicions of the
sucker in the shower.

Unfortunately, this flushing
method inevitably concludes with be-

ing caught. In the past, I have been so_

tickled with the thought of my victims’
discomfort that I have been unable to
suppress my giggling. Confessions are
unnecessary when you are discovered
laughing uncontrollably when the vic-
tim peeks around the curtain. The nick-
names that are thrown at me upon dis-
covery only add-to the entertainment
value. Consequently, if you can control
your emotions, the potential for escape
is yours. And if you can accomplish
such a feat, not only doI give you props,
I would love to hear the story myself.
Until then, I will keep giggling and

flushing, and my unintentional victims °

in other showers on other floors can
continue cursing my immaturity.
