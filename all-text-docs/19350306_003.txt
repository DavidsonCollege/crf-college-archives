STUDENTS LEAD
VEOPER SERVICE

McMullen, Edwards, And Bran-
don Discuss Different View-
points In Regard To Peace

Peace was the subject of discussion
at the student-conducted vesper service
last Sunday evening at the regular hour.

Audley Gammon was the leader for the
meeting, reading the scripture and in-
troducing the speakers. The topic was
Presented from three different -view-
points: “The -Necessity of Peace,” “The
Methods Used to Secure Peace,” and
“What a Davidson Man Can Do to Se-
cure Peace.”

John McMullen, speaking on “The Ne-
cessity of Peace,” stressed the fact that
“isolation at Davidson leads to indiffer-
ence.” Yet the isolation of the United
States is a thing of the past, he con-
tinued, and the actions of our nation
affect other nations.

He said that in like manner we will
be involved if other nations go to war.
Next came a brief summary of the con-
ditions leading to war which were preva-
lent in important foreign countries.

He added that the other side of the
picture was simply an ideal of “World
Brotherhood,” a dream of a world king-
dom in which the golden rule was law.
In conclusion he pointed out that the
“time will not come by itself, but we
must do»our part to make war impos-
sible.”

Wilbur Edwards, the next speaker,
gave a summary of the methods used
and those that can be used. He pointed
out that man’s best instrument in pre-
historic times was protection by prepar-
edness and that.man’s clouded vision to-
day could see no other possibilities for
peace;

The world thought itself secure in its
preparedness of 1910, only to have this

security badly shaken by the World War.

Then began a new trend of peace con-
ferences and disarmament. However,
these are virtually failures, and the world
hegins to realize that efforts to outlaw
war are useless until we sacrifice our
own petty nationalism.

Don Brandon gave a more special dis-
cussion on what we may do to produce
world peace. “Pacifism,” he stated, “has
suffered much due to’worthless plans,
ranging from the absurd to the sublime.”

“Every student desires peace,” he con-
tinued, “but it will not be procured as
long as we are satisfied to sit complacent-
ly and let shallow thinkers dish out our
ideas to us. It is our duty as students
to enlighten ourselves so that we may
make the right decision.”

“A final requisite,” he added, “is that
our hearts must be permeated with the
‘Prince of Peace.’ Then will we have
a ‘peace that passeth all understanding,’ ”

A dismissal prayer by Brandon con-
cluded the program., The organist for
the service was Carlton Chapman. ,

Faculty Team Is
Loser To Varsity

A basketball team composed of mem-
bers of the varsity squad defeated a
team composed of faculty members and
coaches of the college in a game packed
with thrills and surprises for both teams
as well as for the audience. ‘The score
was surprisingly close, the undergrads
winning 34-27,

The varsity team kept a safe margin
of lead throughout the game, but never
did pile up a big lead. The faculty quint
made a strong rally in the last period
but was unable to tie the score.

The faculty team was composed of
Professors Schenck» and McGavock,
Coaches Unger, Laird, McEver and
Whittle, Mr. Hengeveld, registrar, and
Grier Martin, alumni secretary. Mem-
bers of the regular varsity basketball
squad made up the opposing team.,

McGavock, Martin and Laird proved
to be the mainstays for the faculty.
Coach Unger also was very impressive
on the offense. The game was one of
long passes and shooting from all parts
of the court.

The feature attraction of the game,
however, was the cheerleading of Dr.
Richards of the faculty, who was strong-
ly supported in a variety of rah-rah yells
by a cheering section composed of other
members of the faculty and their wives
and friends,

Dr. P.D. Miller To
Speak Here Sunday

Popular Raleigh Minister To
Speak At Combined Eve-
ning Vesper Service

Dr. P. D. Miller, pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church of Raleigh, will be
the vesper, speaker Sunday evening.

Dr. Miller will fill the pulpit of the
Davidson Church at the Sunday morn-
ing service, but there will be no eve-
ning service in the church. The vesper
service will take its place, and the mem-
bers of the congregation are cordially
invited to be present at the vesper meet-
ing.

Dr. Miller is a former Davidson man,
having graduated in the’ class of ‘22.
He then attended Union ‘Theological
Seminary, as a fellowship student.

For a number of years Dr. Miller has
been Executive Secretary of the De-
partment of Home Missions for the
Southern Presbyterian Church, with his
headquarters in Atlanta. Recently. he
has accepted a call to the church at
Raleigh,

Dr. Miller is outstanding, not only for
his work on the Missions Board and
but through his interest
and work with young people, and he
should appeal to the students of Da-
vidson.

WBT Changes Hour
Of Radio Program

Louise Nelson Pfohl Renders
Hungarian Fantasy On First
Thursday Broadcast

Due to the fact that the time of Da-
vidson’s weekly radio program has been
changed, the program was presented on
Thursday, February 28, at eight o'clock.
The program was opened by the march,
“OQ Davidson.”

The Concert Band then played the
march, “Triumphant,” by  Olivadoti.
This number was followed by a cornet
solo by Moreland Cunningham, ‘The
Rosary,” by’ Ethelbert Nevins. Louise
Nelson Pfohl then rendered Franz
Liszt’s “Hungarian Fantasy,” accom-
panied by the Concert Band.

This rendition lasted nineteen min-
utes and was the first time this arrange-
ment had been played in the South. The
manuscript of this arrangement is in the
hands of Falcone, of the University of
Michigan, consequently the University of
Michigan and Davidson are the only
two institutions in the United States to
present this musical arrangement, in
which a band accompanies the pianist.

The hour of the program was not
changed by the college, but by Station
WBT, who found that they had an offer
for the time on Friday night at which
the Davidson program has been held in
the past.

Junior Speakings Originated
With Prize Orations, Poems

By Hat Overton

Having more ivy-grown tradition be-
hind them than any other set of dances
ever held by Davidson students are the
approaching “Junior Speakings.”

The origin of Junior Speaking week-
end goes back into the moss-dripping
past far beyond the range of mere hu-
man memory. So far as*any authori-
ties on the subject remember there have
always been “Junior Speakings.”

True, the original events were not
even remotely like the present-day cele-
brations, yet despite the freely-given
opinion of a well-known authority on
Davidson traditions there is a distinct
connection, and 1935’s dances are a mere
outgrowth of 1850's oratory.

Says Dame Tradition—Junior Speak-
ing was once the time of year when
each member of the Junior class deliv-
ered an oration, then a requirement for
graduation. A companion to this event
was “Senior Speaking,” a preceding day
when all seniors delivered their speeches.

On this famous week-end all the par-
ents, kid brothers, sisters, and loved ones
flocked to Davidson to hear the verbose
orations of the juniors. One of the earli-
est records is of that unusual occurrence
when the class of 1870, tiring of the
usual routine speeches, substituted nur-
sery rhymes for the usual topics. The
speeches soon became so ridiculous that
the audience was dismissed ‘mid sighs of
relief from the scheming juniors.

A social feature has been connected
from the very first. Friends and girls
were invited to the orations and the
traditional warning cry of “FIRE!”
seems to have echoed around Old Cham-
bers since the dawn of Davidson his?
tory.

Usually an athletic event was incfitded
in the program along with some form
of student entertainment. However, stu-
dent “dramatics” came to a sudden in-
glorious end in the 1890's when the
ulty banned such performances.

The date of Junior Speakings was
originally around Washington's birthday,
but when the classes became so large
as to necessitate three and four days of
oratory the date was changed.

It was sometime after 1900 that the
social feature came into predominance.
The following events. were on the pro-
gram in ’17 when the class had grown
so large as to require two days: a bas-
ketball game, a faculty reception, teas,

fac-

and concerts by the Gand) iil glee club.
By this time the number of girls on the
campus far surpassed the throngs
adoring parents.

An important event in the evolution
of Junior Speakings took place in 1921
when lengthiness caused the “compul-
sory speech from every junior”
tion to discontinued?

By 1923 the Y. M, C. A. was offering
a picture show “thriller” in the gym as
an added form of entertainment. Also

of

regula-
be

of note was the “pink tea” given by
fraterniti¢és and a “cabaret” held in the
gym. Y

Lack of oratorical interest manifested
itself in 1927 when only three jumiors
entered the contest. ‘(Incidentally, the
medal is still being offered.)

Just when dancing became a part of
the entertainment is not known, due to
suppression of the subject, but by 1930
the program was virtually the same as
it is today.

At that time dance held in
Mooresville, and one in Charlotte. Many
forms of entertainment were given for
the girls who persisted in coming down
without the encouragement of speeches
(a letter will do). The scenes of ora-
tory had been changed from public halls
to private and secluded corners and
“Junior Speakings’” were in much the
present-day form.
