MavE Black shows colorful side of Davidson history

By NELLE McCORKLE .

This week Miss Mary
Caldwell Black has attended three
church committee meetings,
labelled hundreds of church news-
letters, and stocked her freezer
with homemade whole-wheat
rolls. She. insisted, “Of course,
I‘ra on thé sidelines now.” Asked
how she participates in so many
activities, Black said, “I don’t.do
~ thern all at once.”

Her commitments _ include
Davidson College Presbyterian
Church, where Black is an elder.
She has, ‘held Women .of the
Church offices at the local, pre-
sbytery, and synod levels. Black
said, “They elected my sister in
Concord and me_ to two respec-
tive church sessions in the same
year, and both of us were well past
80 years old, and I don’t under-
stand it. ..seems like you're
pretty bad when you take on 80-
year-old women for such a job.”

Black and her sister Ellen now
live on Concord Road facing Mar-
tin Se Building. A South-

-a hostess.

* potatoes, spinach, eggplant, tur-
_nip greens, squash, cucumbers,

hot peppers, and “okra galore.”
She freezes each summer's har-
vest and also prepares plum jelly
using plums grown on her trees.
Known for her homemade bread,
Black: also bakes biscuits and
whole-wheat: rolls for other
Davidson residents and for out-of-
town relatives.

Local children know Black as
“I like: tea parties for
children,” she said. Black pres-
ides at these occasions using a
china teapot shaped like a laugh-
ing dog and a creamer in the form
of a chubby cow. “That teapot

_ makes the best tea that’s made, ac-
cording to the children that drink |

it,” she said. A second generation
of guests now attends these tea
parties: Nancy Smith Gardner, a
former guest, now escorts her

children to Black’s parties. Gard-
ner said, “I remember going to her
house and visiting ._ with her
mother. Her mother was deaf, and
we would. write notes back and

forth. The tea was greatly im-
proved by the addition of as much
sugar as Miss Mary would allow.
She is now as she was when I was
a child.”

Two previous generations of
area children know Black as a
Sunday School teacher. Elizabeth
Woods, whose children attended
Black’s five-year-old class, said,
“We remember her with affection.
She used parents to assist in
church hour, a new development
at that point and trained them care-

| fully. She is probably one of the

most faithful members in con-
tinuing to work in the church.”

Black came to Davidson with
her mother, sister, and five
brothers in 1918. Her mother
selected the town for the college:
“It was a church school, and then
you: didn’t consider anything
else.” While her brothers attended
Davidson, Black and her family
frequently entertained their stu-
dent friends. “I’ve always lived
with a whole lot of men here,” she
said. “Some called this the Kappa
Sigma Hotel... . One Sunday
my brother said, ‘Who slept in
that front room last night?’ I said,

‘I don’t know; I thought it was a

friend of yours.’ He said, ‘I

thought you knew him.’ Before
dark, here came a friend of ours
who said he wanted to thank his
hosts. He said he just looked
around ‘til he found an empty bed
and got in it.”

Although her brothers all ¢ én-
rolled at Davidson (four graduated
from Davidson: one graduated
from North Carolina State Univer-
sity), Black never attended David
son classes. She said of the col-
lege attitude. toward women who
asked to attend classes: at that
time, “It wasn’t very pleasant re-
ally. They didn’t give them any
recognition — no diplomas, no
certificates. some of the people in

‘town went for two years and then

went somewhere else. They
couldn’t take all the courses —
some of the professors just

-wouldn’t have girls in class.”

Black maintains her commit-
ments and seeks new activities. “I
getbored with one thing,” she
said. “I know how to do more than
I get done. My garden needs a lot
of work now.”

Ballad of Narayama transcends traditional Japanese locale

By BROOKE KNIGHT —

The Ballad of Narayama is,
above all else, real. Although the
setting and time are very distant to
our mode of thinking, Director
Shohei Imamura hurls the viewer
into the basic and realistic human
soul.

.The film confronts us with
problems which make. us throw
off our modern placid certitude: in
_ life, the movie demonstrates,
nothing can be taken for granted.
There,. it’s Life versus Death, In-

dividual versus Society. Although |

the physical scope is limited to a

northern Japanese village com-.

prising only a few families and not
connected with the outside world,
the psychological scope. is im-

_mense. The village is a micro-

cosm of life — a highly concen-
trated piece of life, which makes
everything that goes on immediate
and real. .

A matrifocal family (unusual
in Japanese society) is the center-
piece of action. Orin, whose hus-
band had mysteriously disap-
peared years earlier (leaving her
shamed), guides her family
through daily existence. She ‘is
nearing 70, the age when she will
be taken up to Narayama and left
to die. At that age, she is of no use

. to the community any longer, con-_

suming food, rather than produc-
ing it. The community’s survival
is more important than the indi-
vidual’s. Much of the action is

concentrated on her peeparaeiti
for her own death, so that the fam-

ily will continue for future gener-_

ations. The family’s importance is
placed between the community’s
and the individual’s in the hierar-
chy. In a revealing and poignant
scene, a whole family is buried
alive after having been caught for
stealing. What makes the scene
especially hard to take is that one
of the girls of the family caught
stealing is betrothed to Orin’s
grandson, heir-apparent of the
family. The law of community
supersedes individual emotions.

The viewer walks away with

the feeling that the subject is pre--

sented honestly. Parts are

graphic — however, they are
graphic not to shock but to inform.
You understand their lives be-
cause of the realistic presentation,
without any moral judgments. Im-
amura_ effectively intersperses
scenes of snakes, rodents and
moths copulating and killing be-
tween scenes of humans doing the
same. This brings out the
animalistic nature needed to live
in extreme situations.

The cinematography ranges
from excellent to poor, but one re-
peated egregious technical error
was particularly irritating: the
sound boom would bob at the top

of the screen, taking the viewer to- "

tally out of the scene. The key grip

oughta be shot. Various camera
tricks are effective, but many are
overused. The production is un-
sophisticated by eon Stan-
dards.

The movie moves more quick-
ly than traditional Japanese
drama, but slower than, say,

‘Rambo. But the intensity is at

such a level to keep the audience
riveted for the full lengthy dura-
tion. It is gritty and seemingly
cruel, yet at times it shows the in-
credible depth of human emotion.

Despite the technical prob-
lems, the material is presented
frankly and openly, opening our
eyes to the real struggle for life. It
takes on big themes and handles
them wéll. Three and a half stars.

Nicholson and Turner overcome failures of Prizzi’ Honor

By FLORENCE SNIVELY
_ Movies are, in general, either
serious or funny. Occasionally a

very good movie mixes elements _

of both. Prizzi’s Honortries to be
- both humourous and serious, but
fails. Its humor, gentle mockery
of the traditional love story,
-clashes with the drama of the
gangster movie's life or death
struggle. As a result, when taken
. together the humor seems cheesy
and the drama seems unrealistic.
The action begins as the Priz-
-Zis, a powerful Brooklyn family,
gather for a wedding. It is here
that Charley Partanna (played by
‘Jack Nicholson) first encounters
_ [rene Walker (Kathleen Turner).
She fascinates him but leaves him
in mystery, disappearing without
even telling him her name. We
also meet the striking Maerose
Prizzi (Angelica Huston), black
sheep of the gangster set, and find
that although ‘she was once en-

gaged to Partanna, his interest in

her has faded. The wedding is
more than just a gathering of fam-
ily, however; it is also a cover for
a hit on a rival family.

Charley Partanna and Irene
Walker fall immediately, passion-
ately and predictibly in love.
Neither has creativity enough to
make romance fresh and exciting.
They communicate solely in
cliches. The romance is compli-
cated .by Irene’s professional
life — she too is a hitman and
thief, sometimes in the employ of
the Prizzis. For Irene, total hon-
esty has no place in a relationship.
As Charley and Irene keep secrets
from each other, the Prizzis plot
and scheme around them.

_ The Prizzi who does the most
plotting and scheming is Maerose,
Partanna’s former _ girlfriend.
From the very first, she controls
the way others see her. She ap-
pears inappropriately dressed and

“ succeed, .

is spiteful to shock her father. She
cannot contain her tears when she
wants Partanna to comfort her. It
is almost impossible to tell which
of her apparent emotions to trust.
Angelica Huston balances
Maerose’s spunk and spite per-
fectly. Even the lines of her face
adapt to the facets of Maerose’s
personality — sharp and angular
in business scenes with the Prizzi
bosses, soft and appealing in
scenes with Partanna, who she re-
ally loves. Although Prizzi men
consider their women helpless in
the world of “business,” there is
no doubt that Maerose gets what
she wants.

Jack Nicholson and Keathleen
Turner are both good actors: in
limited roles. Nicholson's Par-
tanna tries to doublecross the Priz-
zis but is not intelligent enough to
Irene plays ‘people

against each other and eventually

gets caught in her own trap. Char-

ley and Irene share a weakness in
their love for each other, but their
love is undercut by humor until its
real existence is questionable.
This is not because of bad acting.
The scene in which Partanna first
realizes Irene is also a crook is
especially fine; by their facial ex-

target primarily because of a con-_
flict-of intentions.-At the outset, it
is clearly a spoof.of The Godfather
movies. Jack Nicholson even
talks like Marlon Brando. Against
the costume backdrop of a gangs-
ter empire, the lovers recite lines
changed from dramatic to humor-

pressions alone the audience-can—ous-by-overuseIn-the-middle-of-

tell exactly when Irene. is lying
and exactly when Partanna be-
lieves her. Unfortunately, the
script does not allow either char-
acter to be particularly lovable or
admirable.

William Hickey is convincing
as Don Corrado, head of the Prizzi
family. small and old, he appears

to-need his sons to speak for him;

at his first appearance he is sleep-
ing in a church pew during the
wedding. When times call for his
scheming, however, he is sharper
than any of the other Prizzis. Don
Corrado survives.

Prizzi’s

Honor misses _ its

the movie, the gangster backdrop
moyes into the foreground and a
complex plot develops. The sec-
ond half of the movie is convo-
luted, fast-moving and suspense-

- ful. Alas, many of the character

motivations come from a truly un-_
convincing beginning; the second

half does not fully stand by itself.

If you can forgive its lack of
unity, Prizzi’s Honor is a pretty
good movie. Its humor, taken by
itself, is funny. Its drama, taken
by itself, is worth watching, if not
absolutely riveting. —Prizzi’s
Honor is entertainment, not
perfectly balanced literature.
