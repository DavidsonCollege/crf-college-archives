the ancient carts stroke to halt
before the lengthened bed.

men descend to uproot

them with razor spades,

rent in two the fallow soil—

(the buds had been transplanted)

not allowed to go to seed, the
hapless heads drop from the napes
of their necks—landing flat

face down on the bark.

Heads you win; tails you lose.
