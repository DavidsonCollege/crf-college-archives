Celebrating Women's Sports

By Robert Lloyd-Still
This school year marks the
twentieth anniversary of women at
Davidson College. For most of
those first ten years, Davidson
women did not participate in inter-
collegiate athletics. Davidson’s
women’s athletics expanded and
improved drastically when the
women’s teams joined the South-
ern Conference in 1982.
In 1972, an intramural swim
team became the first women’s
team at Davidson. Since then, the
college has added nine more. At
the beginning of Southern Confer-
ence play in 1982, there were only
four women’s varsity teams: ten-
nis, basketball, field hockey, and
swimming. Davidson added cross
country in 1985, volleyball in 1986,
track and field in 1987, soccer in
1990, and just this year welcomed
women’s lacrosse.

Senior Women’s Administra- °

tor, Caroline Price, discussed the
changes that she has seen in female
athletics at Davidson since 1982.
“T have seen plenty of changes in
the pastten years.” Price explained,
“The changes have been that
Davidson now sponsors ten
women’s teams, there is broad base
participation, an increase in opera-
tional budgets, and all of this rep-
resents changes thathelp Davidson
to be much more competitive
within our conferences.”

In 1986, the women’s basket-
ball program was terminated, but it

was reinstated in 1991. Davidson
has always been proud of its bas-
ketball tradition and this year’s
women’s team is no exception.
They have made great strides with
major contributions from freshmen
Erin Butcher, Maggie Young, and
Tonya Sharpe.

’For the past ten years,
Davidson volleyball has experi-
enced much success. Last year,
team captain Mimi Plauche was
named Big South Player of the
Year. Like volleyball, the
Davidson field hockey team has
always done well, and this year
they were one of the top teams in
the South.

While these teams have his-
torically done well, there is always
room for new teams, champion-
ships, and titles. Although there is
no women’s golf program, junior
Katie Hammond will participate in
various tournaments this year rep-
resenting Davidson.

Perhaps the biggest accom-
plishment for women’s athletics at
Davidson, however, came in 1984
when the women’s tennis team won
the Division III national champi-
onship.

As the number of teams in-
creases and each team gains more
experience, the future can only
become brighter for women’s ath-
letics at Davidson College. Cer-
tainly themenare notthe only ones
who cansinka three-pointer, serve
an ace, or score a goal.

College Archives Show School
Has Long History of Male Biases

By Towner Blackstock

To most students, the idea of
Davidson without women sounds
foreign and distant. We havecome
a long, long way since the last
century, when Davidson was an
all-male institution for Presbyte-
rian youth.

Prior tothe Civil War, women
had little part in Davidson outside
the purely social realm. The iso-
lated nature of the campus made
any nearby woman quite popular,
however, as letters of the 1850’s
state. David Farley wrote in 1853
that “we have some very pretty
young ladies - - educated, well
accomplished, and refined such as
yourarely meet up with... They are
also wealthy, if you consider that
an assistant ornament.” Another
student, Duncan Buie, commented
ina letter that he “hada huge time
among the country gals. They
think College boysare some pump-
kins.” Apparently, Davidson men
had much in the way of (as Mary
Beaty called it) “feminine soci-
ety”.

The daughters of the college
presidents always drew much at-
tention. Dr. Kirkpatrick, president
from 1861 until 1866, brought his
seven daughters to town and cre-
ated quite a stir among the stu-
dents. More notable to history, if
notto the students themselves, were
the men who married three daugh-
ters of Davidson’s first president,
Robert Hall Morrison: Confeder-
ate Generals Rufus Barringer, D.H.
Hill (who taught mathematics at
Davidson in the 1850’s) and Tho-
mas “Stonewall” Jackson.

The very thought of coeduca-
tion was very nearly unthinkable
inthose times. In an 1888 Davidson
Monthly article, a student editori-
alist reacted to unfounded rumors
of coeducation by assailing the
idea. Inhis eyes, women would be
unable to “bear the mental strain
and fatigue” of Davidson academ-
ics. He asserted that “It has been
proved... that among our educated
women a great many of the inva-
lids can trace their decline of health
to the time when they were in col-
lege.” Certainly that writer would
be surprised to find today’s
Davidson women outperforming
the men academically.

The inevitable social changes
affecting women in society began
toaffect Davidson shortly after the
Davidson Monthly article. While
women had been invited for social
events like costume parties, hay
rides, oyster bakes, and the festivi-
ties at Commencement, only a few
professors’ daughters had ever
been allowed to take classes at
Davidson, and never for any credit.

By the turn of the century,
though, several women attended,
although not as regular students
and unable to earn diplomas. Annie
Browncompleted all requirements
for an A.B. degree by 1901, much
to the surprise of doubting males,
and received a certificate detailing
her accomplishment. She didn’t
get a diploma, though, and neither
did Gladys Summers for complet-
ing the B.S. requirements in 1906.

The Trustees and faculty even-

tually had tocome to grips with the
academic prowess of these women
scholars. In 1925, the Trustees
passed a resolution stating their
approval of “the traditional policy
of the Faculty of Davidson Col-
lege in not encouraging the en-
trance of young ladies,” but also
asserting the belief that the Faculty
“would not be passing beyond what
seems reasonable andrightif, when
a young lady has done the work
required for graduation from
Davidson College, they wouldrec-
ommend her for a diploma and a
degree.” The faculty tacitly ig-
nored this resolution for six years.
Finally, in 1931, they decided it

YEARS

“inadvisable” to make the college
program coeducational.

Wives of students and other
women continued to take course
work at Davidson intermittently
throughout the next few decades.
Lura Owen, married to upperclass-
man Kenneth Owen ’57, supple-
mented her previous studies at
Winthrop with Davidson cours
work while her husband work
toward his own degree. Appar-
ently, Davidson men found her
presence quite a novelty, and she
spent much time passing messages
to the boys in her classes.
