Playing chess threatens to become a Davidson tradition

By Davidsonian sports-

staff writers

The chess club, one of
Davidson’s newest organizations,
has already made a name for itself
in the North Carolina Chess Asso-
ciation and is vying for national
recognition.

The organization received its
charter at the end of the last school
year, and recently received fund-
ing from Davidson officials.

President and founder John
Ballard, no stranger to the game of
chess, ranked 31st in the nation for
all high school chess players. He
hascompeted in chess tournaments
for almost six years and placed
third in the 1993 North Carolina
Junior Invitational.

The chess club’s other driving
force is vice-president Doitch
Kraser. Kraser, best known around

campus as the Domino’s delivery
man with the “bumper-stickered”
car, recently turned the heads of
North Carolina chess players when
he won the 1993 North Carolina
Class D Championship. With a 4-
1 record, Doitch did not lose until
the final round and after four rounds
was guaranteed state co-champi-
onship.

Kraser topped this achieve-
ment two weeks later on October
1-3, when he placed fifth overall in
the Class D section of the United
States Class Championships, fall-
ing just short of second place and
its $250 prize money.

While Ballard and Kraser’s
accomplishments received atten-
tion across the state of North Caro-
lina, the club itselfis still relatively
an unknown on campus.

The club was founded so that

Davidson students who like to play
the game of chess have the oppor-

tunity. Acommon misconception ©

on campus is that students feel
they are not very good and would
not “fit in,” according to Ballard.
Theclub meets on Thursday nights
at 9:30 in the Union Conference
room.
Another goal of the chess club
charter is to be able to hold tourna-
ments at Davidson and compete
against other colleges.

On November 13, the chess
club will host the 1st Annual
Davidson College Chess Champi-
onship. The tournament will be
from 10 a.m.+8 p.m. in the Union
conference room, and will only be
open to Davidson students and fac-
ulty.

There is no entry fee, and
prizes will be plaques for the top

The top four students in this
championship will be eligible to

represent Davidson in the 1993
Pan American Intercollegiate
Chess Championships in Deland,
Florida at the end of December.

New baseball system will defy game's past

Nips continued from page 14

stayed home under the old system.
It was great- the baseball playoff
format was unique to America’s
game and it created longstanding
rivalries and exciting pennant
races.

Now, a team won’t even nec-
essarily have to win their division
to go to the playoffs, and there’ll
be three division winners instead
of two. Baseball’s owners have
decided that second best is sud-
denly good enough. If the new
system were in place in ‘93, the
Braves-Giants pennant race would
never have happened, some pretty
weak teams would have made the
playoffs, andthe World Series may
have lasted into November.

Baseball’s owners saw more
dollar signs in store for them in
realigning, at the expense of the
tradition of the game that baseball
purists shout about. Maybe you
have to irk traditionalists to make
any progressive move in life, and
usually everyone forgets about
being angry and just enjoys the
new system. Not me, man, I’m
Staying bitter. Any time a good
tradition gets sacrificed for
money’s sake people need to
scream and holler.

On to the National Football
League. Why is everyone so upset
about that Houston Oilers football
player losing a week’s pay,
$125,000, for missing a game?
Sports writers are up in arms be-
cause the team withheld his check
when he missed the Oilers’ game
with the New England Patriots to
be with his wife in the hospital
after she’d had a baby, some 17
hours before kickoff time.

I understand folks defending
his actions, and I hope I’d have
done the same thing he did if-my
wife had just had our first child.
But he did miss the game, so why
shouldhe get paid as ifhe’d played
it?

If I don’t show up for my work
study, no matter how good the rea-
son, I don’t get paid as if I’d been
there. The man didn’t play the
game, so he doesn’t deserve to get
paid, it’s that simple. Plus, you do
the math, ifhe’s making 125 grand
each game for sixteen weeks, will
he miss the one check?

Now forsome more rapid-fire
complaints and questions. Wil] *he
Atlanta Braves please come up with
a closing pitcher? Will somebody
at Davidson please trim the tree
branches above the outdoor bas-
ketball courts? What were the pow-

ers that be thinking when they
planting a light pole right smack-
dab in the middle of the same
courts? Does Larry Johnson really
need $84 million dollars? Need I
even ask that question?

Did Michael Jordan really
have to retire? Can anybody beat
Florida State in football? Will any-
one be able to beat North Carolina
in basketball this season? Should
Davidson have beaten Randolph-
Macon or what? Getting tired of
this yet?

Now, I.don’t mean to sound
completely bitter, for there cer-
tainly are some wonderful things
going on in sports today.
Charlotte’s gonna getan NFL fran-
chise this week, college basketball
practice gets underway soon (al-
beit unfortunately late), and Larry
Johnson had the same injury, a
herniated disk in his lower back,
that Ihad thissummer (no lie). But
its good to get angry once in a
while, and I have hereby afforded
myself that little luxury.

I do feel much better now, and
if you’ve read this far thanks for
listening. Now, if you’ll excuse
me I’m going brood as I watch the
last real World Series ever. Hope-
fully my homecoming date won’t
mind.

Western Carolina hosted the
1993 Cross-Country state meet oh
Saturday October 16th. Over
twenty teams travelled tothe moun-
tains to compete for all-state hon-
ors. Acold, steady rain greeted the
Lady Wildcats when they arrived
Friday evening to run the course.
The rain continued through the
night, letting up in the morning
before the gun went off.

The starting line stretched far
with over one hundred and fifty
runners anticipating the gun, eight
runners from Davidson competed.
The first mile of the race was com-

pacted into several tight winding
turns on the schools golf course.
Runners were packed together for
the first mile and spectators got a
good view of the race.

The second mile branched off
intoaloop arounda parking lot and
back through the starting line. A
smaller loop over the golf course
and again around the parking lot
found the runners at the two mile
mark.

After a quick start Phuong
Nguyen led the Wildcats at the
two-mile mark. Despite the soggy
grass and crowded race conditions,
splits hovered around thirteen min-

Cats run respectably.before SC meet

utes.

The third mile started with a
long uphill by resident dorms and
past the sports complex. The trail
levelled off and wound around by
a power plant.

The last half mile hugged the
outskirts of the woods. The trail
gradually sloped downwards, with
the finish line visible, and the har-
riers picked it up on the third mile.
Phuong Nguyen crossed the finish
line in a respectable 20:06. She
was quickly followed by Carolyn
Meadows, Katie McKelvie,
Stephanie Moses, and Erin Roach
all finishing under 20:30. Alicia
Dandar ran a great race with a
personal best of 21:00.

The Lady Wildcats plan to put
it all together for the Southern
Conference Meet next weekend in
Charleston, SC, a very pretty south-
erm town. -«
