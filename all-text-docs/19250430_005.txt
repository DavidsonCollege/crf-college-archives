Preliminary Trials in
Peace Oratory Contest |

to be Held in Raleigh

Strict Regulations Placed on Schools
Entering Delegates

BIG PRIZES OFFERED

Davidson Will Have Representative
in Contest if Plans Mature as
Expected

|
the different oratorical con-,

tests that are attracting attention in the |
collegiate circles is the Peace Oratorical |
Contest which is to be held in Raleigh |
on May 27 or 28 of this session. This
contest is a state affair and is open to
all colleges in North Carolina. However,
there are certain requirements made of4J
each school before it is allowed to enter |
a candidate. |

Among

Before any student is eligible to par-
ticipate in this contest, must win
over five other candidates in his school.
This requirement causes more interest
en the part of the students and at the

he

time assures better orations. The sub-
jects of these orations must be about
“Peace.” The speaker may treat this

subject in any way. that he wishes and
the oration must be at least fifteen min-
utes in length. Only first and second
prizes will be awarded to the respective
winners of the contest. The first prize
will he $60 and the second one will be |
$40. |

As was stated above there must be a!
preliminary in each college in which six |
men take part. The winner of this con-
test will represent his school at Raleigh
in May. Davidson College will have no}
trouble in getting six men out for the
preliminary and there will be some good
ones, too, The date for the preliminary
at Davidson has not yet been definitely
st but it will in all probability be with-
in two or three weeks.

Davidson has been unusually active in
debating and oratory this year, having
taken part in several debates and in
more than one oratorical contest. Too
much praise cannot be given to Prof
Wachter who has given so much of his |
time to these contests and to helping and |
encouraging in every way he can, those
who are interested in speaking. Several
of the students have proven themselves
to be speakers of ability, Whoever rep-
resents Davidson in the Peace Oratorical,
it is certain that he will be a strong con-
tender for the prize.

Maulden, pitching for the Davidson Fresh-
men against State first year men, allowed
the Techmen but six hits, and won his
game 9 to 4, despite the fact that Davidson
made five errors, and the Wildkittens were
unable to make but seven hits. The fact that
State made four errors accounted for some
of the runs of Davidson.

Johnson was easily the star of the game.
He made three of the Davidson hits, getting
three hits and two walks. out-of. five times
up. Two of the three hits were for three-
baggers. Arrowood made two bingles out of
five trials that day. Johnson also made six
catches in centerfield that day.

Lovers, strumming romantic airs and
serenades, and bold picadors dodging
the fierce attacks of blood-thirsty bulls
who sooner or later will fall under the
spear of the agile matadors, will carry
the audience to Castile and Aragon,
where for an hour or two they will be
entertained by comedians, soloists, and
beautiful senoritas, all speaking Spanish,
and adding a realistic touch to the even- |
ing’s entertainment.

The entertainment will be unusual in
view of the fact that the whole perfor- |
mance will be void of any English word
or action, and will be entertaining in
spite of the fact that due to a sad lack

of bulls, students will be forced to as-
sume this familiar role. It is rumored
among Spanish enthusiasts that a cer-
tain Davidson student, bearing the name
of the discoverer of electricity, makes an
ideal- male-cow—and his presence in the!
unusual: cast assures the audience of at}
least one bit of realism. The lack of a!
teal bull at first threatened to destroy
the possibilities of the play, but in-
genuity conquered—and a bull, who will
do things and make noises no bull ever ;

hoped to do before jis going to add zest
to the entertainment.

But, that’s only a starter—students of
the modern-day college find no trouble
in imitating bulls. But, when a man is
asked to make an of himself and
act as a mule, then the fun commences.
And that's exactly what three of the
actors in the entertainmen are called on
to do. They must wrap themselves in the
skins of jackasses, and with neighing
and balking, they will drag the woundgd
bull from the arena, after the daring
matador has struck him under the fifth
rib.

Blood will flow freely, and so will the
bull—blood. From the more gruesome
portrayals, the scene suddenly shifts to
ancient Spanish theater, where a
beautiful maiden, wrapped in a vari-col-
ered shawl, will trip the light fantastic
in a typical Spanish tango, dancing to
the melodious strains of a Spanish guitar.
The whirl of the dance, and the beauty
of the dancer, coupled with the soft musi-
cal accompaniment, will leave the au-
dience gasping for breath.

He who misses the Spanish entertain-
ment misses much, so say the enthusias-
tic promoters of the entertainment. And
so say we all of us. Muy bien.

Forgiveness of sins. A new spiritual life.
When I speak to God is there anything in it?
Do I get victory and eternal life? He that
helieveth not is condemned. He has prom-
ised, all, the eternal riches; victory and
eternal life. Jesus gives you power. He is
power, Can He do what He says He will do?
Yes, Jesus promises everything, and He can
deliver it. If He can do it for you, He can
do it for others. We as students can plant
our feet, and ‘stand on what we know, and
then can climb up from this. Thank God for
faith.

“On our continent are three zones :
temperate and frigid. There are three zones
to intellectual life. The torrid zone of our
continent is filled with disease, and it has
never produced any great civilization. The
frigid, has nothing there; it is too cold., Be-
tween the temperate; this the
power zone. Here we find strong men, and
intellectual ability. In the zones of intellee-
tual life, in the torrid they believe all, in the
frigid they believe nothing. Between, there
is the great zone of life and power, “Faith.”

Dr. Frazer Hood introduced the speaker
as being a man possessing two traits of char-
acter: the power of leadership and the power
of stirring up the intellectual revival in the
| Southern Presbyterian Church. FE. K. Regen

| South, by saying that if he were to select a
|text for his addres he would choose: “Glory
lin thine inheritance.” And_ this text
| was justified by the address which makes
real to Southern sons an inheritance in which
|they may justly glory, never: forgetting that
the South is an integral part of an indevis-
able and everlasting union, the United States.

Eloquently and vividly the speaker related
and pictured the history of the South, be-
{ginning by contrasting this land, which.was.
formerly the hunting ground of the red man,
to the present thriving land developed in the
wake of progressing civilization, leading
finally to the grand culmination, the hope
burning in the Southern heart: “One flag,
one heart and one country.”
