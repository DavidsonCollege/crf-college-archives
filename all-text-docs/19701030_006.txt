AMIDST MIDEAST STRIFE

Polley Makes Archeological Find

By RICHARD WILSON

Asst. Managing Editor

Professor of Bible and Re-
ligion Max E. Polley groped
through dirt and_ pottery
chips in an archeological dig
last summer to discover a
bronze nail dating approxi-
mately 3,500 B.C.

Sponsored by the Hebrew
Union College of Cincinnati,
this program concentrated
on the excavation of the an-
cient Canaanite town of Ge-
zer, located midway be-
tween Tel Aviv and Jerusa-
‘lem in Israel.

"Tt was very meticulous
work and beastly hot with
temperatures reaching -~120
degrees,” he said, ‘‘They
wouldn't let us measure the
temperature until the last
day for fear we would be
discouraged.”

The site was laid out in a
grid fashion forming several
areas approximately fifty
feet square, explained Pol-
ley. “Seven laborers were
assigned to each of these
areas where we chose our
own corner to begin dig-
ging.” he said.

“We were also given tools
consisting of a pick, hoe,
hand pick called a ‘petiche,’

itrowel, brushes, dustpans,
and a_ sledgehammer for
large rocks. Because so

much damage .can be. done
by digging with’a shovel, we
were not allowed to use one.

Polley explained that very
few pleces of pottery were
found unbroken. “Produced
for domestic use, this sort
of pottery was very crude.
‘Whenever it was broken, the
Canaanite women just threw
it out the window. Eventual-
ly it would become part of
the dirt road,’”’ he said.

“Most of the whole pieces
of pottery which are found
usually. come from burial
caves,"’ he said: ‘“The rest
just gets crushed.”’

This archeological program
was set up fo aid students
studying in this general
field of: knowledge. Ameri-
can students have to pay for
their transportation. to Is-
rael which amounts to ap-
proximately $535 round trip,
but after they arrive, they
receive their food and todg-
ing free.

Polley indicated: that he

hoped some Davidson siu-
dents could participate in
ie program for academic
credit next summer, since
the dig will continue for only
one more season.

Despite the heat-and the
seemingly monotonous task
of separating dirt from pot-
tery fragments, Polley said
he never lost interest.

‘We would get up at 4
a.m. and work’ in the field
area until 12:30 p.m. After
junch we would work inside
scrubbing and marking pot-
tery. Our evenings were oc-
cupied by lectures on, such
topics as stratigraphy and
pottery chronology,” he
said.

Polley noted that he had
very little conflict with re-
spect to the Mid-East war.
“We had to cancel only one
trip because the cease fire
had just been declared, and
there was increased Arab
querrifia activity.

“In the archeology ‘camp I
heard both sides of the Mid-
dle East conflict: These de-
ba‘es took place constantly
while I was there. I more
fully realized that there is
a lot of agony on_ both

sides,”’ he said.
Polley commented that

the military presence in the

Golan Heights area was

striking. “Old Russian tanks
and fixed gun emplacements
are still left there probably

for propaganda reasons.

“In fact they are painted
periddically with’ antirust
paint, so that they won't
disintegrate. They function
as very effective remind-
ers,”’ he said.

In addition to visiting Is-
real, Polley sojourned to
Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt.

After seeing so many Pal-
istinian. refugees in Leba-
non, Polley sald one could
not help but have human
sympathy. “! hope for the
day when the problem can
be solved,” he said.

“In Egypt the people were
very friendly.
come up to you on the street
and ask whether you--were
aim American. In most cases
this was because they want-
ed to trade American money
on the black market,"’ he
said. :

Polley remarked that the
most interesting person he
met last summer was Emil
Aghaby, a manager of two
hotels in Beirut.

“Emil was an_ Episco-
palian Arab who left Jeru
salem in 1948 as a refugee.
He went to Beirut where he
became a manager of his
hotels and formed an Angli-
can Church called St. Geor-
ge’s congregation. He was as
close to being a minister as
anyone.

“He was a very intelligent

Players Present Jonson’s ‘Alchemist’

By DOUG BROWN.
Staff Writer
Drama Department
will present Ben’ Jonson's
comic classic ‘‘The Alche
mist’ as its first play for
this academic year. Written
in 1610, ‘‘The Alchemist’’ is
one of the most— enduring
comedies in English.

It is notable for. its wit-
ticisms, multiple plots, dis-
guises, and topical allusions.

The

The audience will undoubt-
edly appreciate its brisk
pace and originality. How-
ever, ‘The Alchemist’s’’ se-

ven plots make it PxTaey
complex.

The principal characters
in this play are Subtle, Face,
and Dol Common, who are
three ingenious, petty crimi-

nals. Their income is deriv-
ed from fraudulent schemes
perpetrated against several
of thelr more gullible breth-
ren.

The staging is modern be-
cause th@re are on the one
hand hippies and mods and
on—the—other—conservatives
and hard hats. The langu-
age, however, is still’ that
of Ben Jonson.

Rupert T. Barber Jr., as-
sistant professor of speech
and drama and director of
“The Alchemist,“ said, ‘The
cast has been able to handle
the language and complexi-
ties of the play very well.”

Today's audience would
not appreciate the many
topical references. Conse-

2 Special Performance for D.C. Students Nov

* quently,

edited by Anthony A. Ab-
bot, associate professor of
English, and V. Cullum Ro-
gers, a senior English ma-
jor. Another result of this
editing is that the pace’ of
the play has been quicken-
ed.

“I'm afraid some people
won't come because they
thave read ‘The Alchemist’
and found it the most boring
play they have ever read.”
said Rogers.

“Ti is not an enjoyable
play to read because it. is
primarily intended to be act-
ed out. It is a very physical
play, and very much an av-
dience reaction play.”

About the play’s relevance
to today, Barber said, ‘’It
is just as timely today as it
was in 1610. Many people
are“trying to get rich quick,
and money is very EMIROFt:
ant to them.

“They are willing to do
anything to get wealthy as
quickly as they can. Conse-
they: are willing to
ee” themselevs be tricked by
such people as con artists.”

“The Alchemist” gives a
beter picture of Elizabeth-
an drama.) commented Ro-
gers. ‘“Most people read
mainiy Shakespeare, and, al-

hough he, is far superior to
the o-her playwrights of the
‘ime, he gives a false -pic-
tore. Ben Jonson's language
is simple, although h’s plots

‘are ‘complicated.

The language doesn’t sound
like poetry, and Jonson de-

’ monstrates: how much Eliza-

-bethan drama’ can be under-

stood.

Rogers, winner of the Best
Actor Award Mast year for
his performance in ‘Don't
Drink The Water,’ will por
tray. Subtle. Peter Lutkin,

master of ceremonies in ‘‘Oh
What A Lovely War,” will
play Face.

The third major role, that
