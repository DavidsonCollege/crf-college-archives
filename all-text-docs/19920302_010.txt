Davidson Alumnus Exhibits Photography at Union Gallery

By Chris Hoveland

The Union’s Gallery Com-
mittee is hosting several works of
Davidson Alumnus Elijah Gowin
(*90) in the first floor gallery of
the Union. The exhibit will run
for two weeks beginning Mon-
day, February 24, and features a
few photographs from Davidson
as well as several from Gowin’s
recent expedition to India.

Gowin’s works are mono-
chrome prints, although there are
some that are tinted. Several
themes pervade the prints: doors
and entranceways, figures with
somewhat haunting expressions,
and often the photographs con-
tain an underlying and somewhat
disturbing element. For instance,
onecalled Passageway to Atrium,
Scarperia, Italy, 1990, shows a
Roman tablet inscribed with Latin
ona wall inthe background, while
in the front right stands a dimem-
bered manequin - out of place and
outof shape. Another called Con-
struction, India, 1991, shows a

doorway covered by stran-
gley shaped cloths. It
looks like a passage-
way, but the shabby
cloth communicates a
subtle warning, and at
the same time inspires

a curious attractive-
ness.

Gowin, originally
from Newtown, Penn-.
sylvania, was an art
history major while at
Davidson, but took no
photographic instruc-
tion here other than an
independent study
with Dr. Frank Bliss.
Photography was not
foreign to Gowin since
his father is also a pho-
tographer. (His father
recently worked on a
series of abstract land-
scapes taken from an
aerial perspective.)
Gowin did not take up
photography seriously

"The Mission's Clear..."
for Phish's New A Picture Of Nectar

By Chip Petree

First of all, for those of you
who couldn’ tdistinguish an opin-
ion from last weeks review, the
point was that Col. Bruce and the
boys are so good that it’s sick and
frightening. But recently, anew
release from Phish has burstupon
the scene, and I might have to be
shipped to Siberia because of my
fear (that means it’s good).

Seriously, the Burlington,
Vermont-based band’s new
album, A Picture of Nectar, was
released about two weeks ago,
and it’s truly a great album. I try
to save that part for the end, but I
think I’ll go ahead and say it. This
album follows in the tradition of
Phish’s superb albums, produc-
ing asound that is true to their live
performances and featuring the
masterful talents of guitar player
Trey Anastasio, keyboardist Page
McConnell, bassist Mike Gordon,
and drummer/trombone player
Jon Fishman (also known as
Showboat Gertrude). As we heard
in Love Auditorium last Novem-
ber, Phish’s unique blend (and
twist of) rock, jazz, funk, blues,
and bluegrass is definitely an ex-
perience.

The album opens with
“Llama,” a song that features the
frenetic pace of Fishman and Gor-
don’s rhythm section. Then, fol-
lowing a mellow composition of
Anastasio, “Cavern” bursts in with

a funky groove and the refrain .

that includes the title of the al-
bum. :
“Give the director a serpent

deflector/a mudrat detector, a rib-
bonreflector/acushionconvector,
a picture of nectar/a virile dissec-
tor, a hormone collector.” The
strange, Dr. Seuss-like lyrics fit
the strange, funk twist of the music
as only Phish can do. Later tunes
include the bluegrass song “Poor
Heart,” the reggae-style “Guelah
Papyrus,” and the jazz groove

_ “Magilla.” “The Landlady,” which

opened the Davidson show, is a
calypso jam that features the
screaming guitar work af, Anasta-
sio.

The last part of the album fea- °

tures the intense jam of “Tweezer”

and. straightforward rockin’ of
“Chalk Dust Torture.” Other, more
humorous songs such as “The
Mango Song” and “Catapult” fill
out the album which closes with
the joyous “Tweezer (Reprise).”

This album is “nothin’ but #

jam....again.”

As the liner notes indicate, the
name of the album refers to and is
dedicated to Nectar Rorris. Rorris
is the proprietor of “Mectar’s,” the
establishment in Burlington that
gave the band its first bar-gig de-
spite their “lack of experience, or-

logic of pictorial expression \are
similar -- in fact, interrelated -- and
wishes that that connection could
be developed more often in the
realm of academics, particularly
here.

When asked how he came
about deciding to pursue photog-
raphy as acareer, Gowin remarked,
“You can’t decide it really, it de-
cides it for you. ... Youmay notbe
following something you under-
stand, but you follow it anyway.”
A piece of advice for dreamers:
“Now is the time you can afford to
be led by something. Take advan-
tage of it, and have faith.”

Gowin’s plans for -the near
future include a trip to eastern
Europe, during which he will fin-
ish his portfolio. After a year he
will attend graduate school. He
would also like to teach photogra-
phy. He would instruct his, stu-
dents about “thinking visually,”
and putting words to the abstract
ideas behind their images.

until he was a junior, and
now, four years
later, he returns to
show his work.
When
asked how
Davidson aca-
demics prepared
him for hiscareer,
Gowin replied,
“Well, you
wouldn’t come to
Davidson _think-
ing this would be
a good place to
study photogra-
phy,” but added,
“I wouldn’t be
able to think about
photography the
way I do ifIhadn’t
had the academic
background I re-
ceived _ here.”
Gowin finds that

guage and the
