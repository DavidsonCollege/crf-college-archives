‘Christmas . . .

Christmas, more than any other, is
the outstanding holiday of the year. Not
only at Davidson but in schools and col-
leges all over the country it marks a break
in the year. We look forward to it.and
back upon it with more than the usual de
light, for all the Christmases of the past
have combined in their contribution to
this idea.

In no season of the year are so. many
of the delights and devotions of the hearts
of men combined. We find endless ex-
pressions of friendship and love, of joy
and goodwill, of giving and receiving.
The Christmases we have known have
been those of ‘Peace on Earth, afd Good-
will toward men.”

But now at Davidson we are looking
forward to another wartime. Christmas
as are men everywhere. | This in itself
i$ almost a contradiction of terms. The
word Christmas has always been synano-

It is hard to reconcile
the idea of war with the one season of the
year that at its commencemnt was dedi-
cated to the spirit of peace. We cannot
forget the one, yet it is all important to
remember the other. ;

Those especially who can re-
member it before there was a war know
that a different spirit prevails. Yet in
most ways we have kept the old customs
and traditions fully intact: We have
not lost those things which have so long
been associated with the college.

There are two of these which deserve
special mention, the Y.M.C.A. gift fund
and the Christmas’ Vespers. To both of
these projects and to those responsible
for their great success we owe a debt of
gratitude.
ent expressions which all will recognize
as belonging fully to all that we cherish
in the long history of the College.

The Y.M.C.A. Gift Fund can be said
to fully show the spirit of “goodwill to
men” that prevails here. In the past this

has always been given to some cause of
permanent value which the students feel
is worthy of their support. The great
spirit of giving which is one of the-pri-
mary ideas of the Christmas. season is
fully expressed in this gift from the Da-

vidson students. The ardent support,

which resulted in oversubscription of our*® Gunning

goal shows how alive this tradition has
remained in the present school life.

The Christmas Vespers has always
symbolized the idea of beauty and devo-
tion which is represented in the College
tradition. | ‘This year there was no let
down either in.the amount of work or in
the presentation that has always been
characteristic.

‘The crowds came as in the past and
went away with the same satisfaction.
There are few places where both the tal-
ent and the willingnss to prepare and pre-
sent such a program are present. We are
fortunate that even with the hardships
involved and lack of students to perform,
the same quality of performance was pos-
sible. In light of this also we realize that
the spirit of beauty and devotion from the
past are fully alive today.

This will be a quiter, more sober
Christmas than those of the past. Our
thoughts are far away with those who
cannot be with us, or may never be with
us again.

Still—

Though war makes all the earth run red
with blood,

And fills the days with cries of fear

and pain,
Yet above all the noise and strife, they
hear ways

Who listen, angels singing hymns of

peace.

Social Life... .-<

One of the most important phases in
the activities of any college is its social
life. Although this is fully realized, :it
has been somewhat neglected in the past
at Davidson.

Definite action this has been taken
both by O.D.K. and the social committee
of the Y.M.C.A. ‘The results are quite
evident from the success of the Queens-
, Davidson square dance. Functions of
this type are definitely needed on the
campus. ‘They are a contribution to a
well-rounded college life. The ideas of
the past have been realized to be outmod-
ed. The future holds good prospects.
No little effort is required to bring
these. functions about. Not only the sup-
port of the student body but the active in-

terest of the faculty is important. Many

boys are willing to take part in them but

not in helping plan them.

In the future more of the social side of
our college life will be emphasized. The
prospect of dances on the campus is one
of the best along this line. It offers
to the students the one phase of social
life which is considered to be the gratest
in importance.

It is true that this can be over-empha-
sized in campus life. An overbalance in
either direction is not only bad but can
become disastrous. Davidson has al-
ways Sought the proper balance:in all its
activities. However gradual this process
may be, we should always strive to obtain
those things which go to make up a well-
rounded college career.

Around

Will sat at his typewriter holding
the edges of the table as a preacher
would grip his pulpit, looking at the
blank paper before him. He was
crooning under his breath in his
mediocre voice, “—laughed at the
rain together.” He stared out of the
door he faced, down the hall to the
curtained windows; now he sat still
and stared harder, for something
lazier than the misty drizzle seemed
to be falling on the other side of
the pale yellow curtains. Will swung
around in his chair to face the big,
bare window which was behind him.
Yes, he was right; it was not raining
now, it was snowing.

Big white flakes swirled down
through the mid-afternoon sky. Will
looked through the scratched crys-
tal on his wrist watch; it was only a
few minutes past three-thirty and it
was December 11th, but outside the
first snow of the year was falling
on the Dodson campus.

He watched the flakes stick to the
black bark of a felled oak not far
from the window of the Student
Union where he sat. The great old
tree had been cut down with several
other dead trees on the campus a
month ago, had been sawed _ into
sections, but now it lay, still waiting
to be chopped and stacked in the
Wood shed of the. President's or
some professor’s home.

Will’s eyes followed the descent
of one flake until it became part of
the icy slush on the wet brick walk
below. He changed his tune from
“laughed at the rain together” to
“T’m dreaming of a white Christ-
mas—” and thought of the four days
of college classes remaining before
the holidays. He thought—one
week—hometwo weeks — Christ-
mas. Will thought too of his date
Saturday with Jean; they had talked
of Christmas, home, snow--had
caught the Christmas spirit’ from a
Christmas carol, from the hustling
Christmas shoppers, from the brisk
December air.

Will's mind-snapped back to the
present, leaving thoughts
drifted in’ mental snow clouds. Iie
turned from the flurry outside the
window and concentrated on quell
ing the flurry within his own mind.
His blue English text reminded him
of the monthly test which he had
the next day in Professor Bacon's
English 71; he thought also about
the term paper. he was going to
have to write during the holidays
Taverns and Coffee Houses of the
Eighteenth Century.

Will thought of the low grade he

was going to have to pull up in,
Latin before the semester exams—

semester exams—that was going to
be a worry in all his classes. He
thought about his trip home on Sat-
urday—which route should he take
—should he buy a round trip ticket
—should he pack two bags? He
wondered if he should write — his
folks he was coming in Sunday
morning instead of Tuesday or

should he just walk in and surprise

them? He wondered if he would
find time-to get his Christmas cards
mailed out before he left.

These worrigs seemed insignifi-
cant; there was something more
urgent on his mind—what was it?
Then it came to him. He stared
again at the blank paper in his type-
writer and knew what it was. He
had to write Something, a whole col-
umn of it, for the Dodosonian
which went to press that night;
that’s what he had to put down on
the paper before him.

Will adjusted the paper holders
on his typewriter, looked out at the
falling snow, and started to typ with

his hunt and peck system— “Will .

edges of the table as a preacher.” —

HIL MASTERS

Since Christmas is just “down the
road a piece,” there will probably be
a rush to the stores and a buying
of presents. Many a perplexed stu-
dent has asked another for a stgges-
tion on what to buy for his girl. Of
course the other boy doesn’t know ~
so as to clear things up I (some-
how, I always get mixed up.in these
articles) will try to give you a few
suggestions.

First of all don’t give her any-
thing too expensive (need I worry?)
for she might not be worth it.
Equally important, it must not be
too cheap. We have heard of a boy |,
who waits before he gives any pres-
ents to his girl until he fnds out
what she is giving him. This isn’t
the proper attitude or Christmas
spirit. We also hear of the cad who
bought a half a dozen watches ot
the same make at one time (I got a

brother in the business).

Let's take the case of a fellow
who is found around the dormitories.
It seems that he had his eyes on a
girl (what else?) with whom he had
feel

a few dates. He began to

when one of ‘his “buddies” came in
and told him what.a wonderful time °
he had with this particular girl. Now
he wonders if he should give a bigy.
expensive gift and try to win her
back or should he give her nothing.
My suggestion is the latter. What
can he lose, except the girl?

Also comes the subject of pres-
ents. Christmas is known for its
loud ties, silver dollars from great
aunts, last year’sshat creation. About
the nicest gift a, boy could receive
would be a year’s subscription to
“Esquire.” “Even though he can’t
read he can look at the pictures (is
that bad?). If one could buy a car-
ton of cigarettes (see Hugo) that
would be nice, too. The Christmas
tie is most publisized gift of all. Some
radio comedians have based their
whole show on this lowly bit of ap-
parel. Where they get the designs
for them no one knows. The de-
signers, I’m told, are locked up as
soon as the holiday is over until the
following Christmas.

remember a story about a man who
was wearing his new neck-tie during
a blackout. He was arrested for
showing a light (it filled space any-
way). Now this story must be
“stretched.” Everybody knows that
a tie couldn't be that bright any-
way his overcoat would keep the
light in. Without a doubt Christmas
has its disadvantages.

Despite

Being serious for a moment, I will
say that just the idea «wf Christmas
js a heart-warmer. In this world
which is at war, it is a privilege to
sit back and count your many bles-
sings. The idea of good fellowship
—the idea of peace—are things that
every civilized person wishes. The
singing of carols, the giving of
presents, and the praising of God are

things that every civilized person
does.

So in closing I wish one and all
a Happy Christmas and a Prosper-

ous New Year, for I hope that, This
Might Be Yours.
