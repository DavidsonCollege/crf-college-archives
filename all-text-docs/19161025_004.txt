WEEKLY MEETINGS

In the Phi Society, on Saturday night,
October 21st, the regular weekly debate
was held, the subject being, “Resolved,
that the Federal Government — should
own and operate all railways doing an
interstate business. The affirmative was
vpheld by Messrs. Bullock, Querv,
Fleming, Roberts and Paisley. “Phe
affirmative presented sume very good
noints, showing how the change would
herefit the nation and how it could
easily be accomplished. “The negative.
upheld by Cumming, McDonald, C. W.
Worth and Foscue, proved among other
things that a change was unnecessary and
that the railways would be expensive
and inefficient in the hands of the Gov-
erament. The committee decided — in
favor of the negative, as also did the
house.

In the Eumenean Society Saturday
night qfite a good meeting was held.
In the absence of the president, the vice-
president, J. R. Woods, took the chair.
G. C. Crouch was elected a member of
the society and his initiation took place
with due formality Monday morning.
The debate was, as the Reviewer said
“Yacking in pep,” but several speeches
were good and good points were brought
out. “The affirmative was upheld by
Messrs. Bachman, F. M. Mitchell and
Bellingrath, and the negative by Messrs.
Brand, Boggs and Hamilton. There
were two short speeches from the house.
Both the judges and the house voted in
favor of the affirmative.

At the Monday morning meeting the
second term officers were elected: FE.
H. Hamilton, president (by acclama-
tion); G. C. Bellingrath, vice-president ;
Kk. A, Woods, secretary; J. K. Hobson,
reviewer,

ELECTION OF MARSHALS

‘The regular exercises were suspended
in the two societies Monday morning,
and marshals were elected for this year.
To the Eumencan Society fell the choice
of chief marshal, and W. Y. Sayad was
elected to this position. ‘The other mar-
shals elected in the Eu. were: C. R.
Jenkins, J. R. Morton, B. D. Roddey
and S. R. Keesler, while in the Phi.,
W. H. Neal, J. C. Paisley, ~R. H.
Stone and O. C. Williamson were
chosen.

At the meeting of the local Polity
Club on last Friday night the chief ideas
in Norman Angell’s book, “The Dang-
ers of Half-Preparedness” were discuss-
ed by. R. H. Ratchford. ‘The central
thought of the book was that a nation,
altho it had a strong army and navy,
was only half-prepared unless it also
had a definite, formulated foreign policy.

FRESHMAN LECTURE
BY DR. SEN’TELLE

The regular semi-monthly lecture to
Freshmen was given last Friday morn
ing by Dr. Sentelle. In his subject,
“Standards of a College Man,” he ex-
plained that the principal difficulty in
college life is that we are all in too big
a crowd. He said that a man by him-
self was different from a man in’ a
crowd. When a man gets in a crowd
he loses his individual responsibility and
the power of thinking for himself. He
is carried forward by the crowd and not
by any power of his own.

He stated that if a man spent. ten
hours a day at his work, every student
should put at least ten hours a day on
his studies, which are preparing him for
his life work. If we are to sharpen our
intellects, we will have to grind, and
grind hard, otherwise our minds wil!
deteriorate instead of broaden while iv
college.

He emphasized the fact that every
student should be courteous, not only te
his fellow-students, but to any visitor or
stranger that he might see on the campus.
And when a visiting team comes to the
campus to play, treat them as honored
guests, giving them everything but the
game. Be so courteous to them that
when they leave they can savy nothing
but good things about Davidson, and
will be only too glad to return at the
first opportunity.
