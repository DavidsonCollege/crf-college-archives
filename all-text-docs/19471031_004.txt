Not so with VM. Once more the. ’Cats are keyed up, and
raring to go. In spite of four erppling injuries and several
minor ones, the ‘Cats mean to make no mistakes in downing
the Kevdets this time. The beginning of this year found the
Keydets with not as many returning gridders as the Wildcats
boast. In addition, a new coach and. the installation for the
first time of the T-formation, should haye slowed them down
a bit. Thus far they have won two and lost three, losing to
such teams as Georgia Tech and the University of Virginia.

The two outstanding men for the Keydets are Captain
Malachi Mills, All-Southern tackle material, and Bobby
Thomason. Thomason termed ‘‘best passer in the state’’ and
“the state’s most outstanding football player’’ last year, ran
the tailback on last season’s single wing and is handling the
quarterback chores under the T. The ’Cats better watch out
lest his passing from this position prove fatal.

In spite of the W. and L. disastex, crippling injuries, and
Coach Story’s laments, the Red and Black are equal to any-
thing V. M. I. can throw their way. and we think they'll win.

Fetzer, but a recent release of Big Five statistics (before the
W. and L. game) shows that the Wildeats can top ’’em all in
the running and passing departments. As a result of the

Hampden-Sydney frolicing, Ereshman Auburn Lambeth
stood above the Big Five notables in both departments.
Diminutive Jake Wade. also stood at the head of the list_of
ground gainers, and Burt Anderton with Lambeth was ahead
of aee Fetzer in the passing averages, Of course, these figures
are not indicative, because these boys have not played much
and not against top-flight competition, but all the same, it’s
in the figgers.

those who need one) will be to take a jaunt to Memorial Sta-

forthe beets about the scheduling of a game during the dance
