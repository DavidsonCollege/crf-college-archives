The Silver Screen

Wednesday, Sept. 283—A Successful Calamity
—(Warner Bros.)

This is not as outstanding as some of the
pictures in which Mr. Arlis has played, but
it is unique in one respect at least in that it
is clean,”

The story is that of a man who returns
from Europe only to find his family so in-
tensely involved in social activities that he
is unable to be with any of them for any
length of time. As a solution to -his diffi-
culty he decides to become poor and does so
in a very entertaining manner.

Evalyn Knapp is sincere in her portrayal]

of the daughter and Mary Astor as thé
wife is charming; but probably the most
amusing performance is that of Hardie Al-
bright as the daughter's suitor. é

Thursday, Sept. 29—Bring ’Em Back Alive—
(RKO) fe
Having bought the sights to Frank Buck’s
book on how he eaptured wild animals for
the U. S. Zootogical Gardens, RKO dis-
patched Mr./Buck with a director and two
cameramen to record the procedure.

Dependent entirely for its power of attrac-
tion“upon the almost inherent human_ love
for wild animals, the picture consists of a

“series of combats between different animals
of the jungle, perhaps the most amusing
of which is python versus honey bear. A
large variety of wild life is not lacking.
