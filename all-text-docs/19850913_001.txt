The Davidsonian

Special Edition

Davidson College, Davidson, North Carolina 28036

Friday, September 13, 1985

By ANDY BARRON

To those who have suffered
through the last few years of disas-
trous Davidson football, last
Saturday’s 13-0 loss to powerful
Western Carolina felt like a vic-
tory.

Yet to first-year head coach
Vic Gatto, last Saturday was a lost
opportunity.

“T don’t have the emotional at-
tachment to Davidson’s recent
football history that the fans pos-
sess,” Gatto said. “Going into the
game, the coaches felt we would
be able to move the ball on West-
em. If we could have scored one

of the three times we got within ©

fifteen yards of their end zone, we
may have been able to alter West-
ern’s game plan enough to win the
game.”

Let it be known Davidson
football has changed. Against

Western, Carolina the Wildcats |

threw 55 passes. Junior quarter-
back Steve Bradley had 26 com-
pletions for 245 yards. The inces-
sant reverses and draw plays of
yesteryear are no more. The fan of
the forward pass will love the
change.

Unfortunately, Bradley’s bar-
rage of passes failed to produce
4 any points. Davidson's three scor-
“ ing opportunities ended in inter-
ceptions and a missed field goal.

“Good execution is critical to
us if we are going to compete with
our opponents’ superior size and
speed,” Gatto said. “I was disap-
pointed that our execution inside
Western’s 15 yard line wasn’t as
crisp as it was leading up to the
15.”

Gatto and the coaching staff
recognized the efforts of several
other players. Receiving offen-
sive player of the week was senior
wingback Jay Poag who led the
team with twelve receptions.
Senior defensive back Tony Smith

was named defensive player of the
game for his constant hustle over
the field. Finally, senior Doug
Neil was named special teams
player of the game.

Though Davidson ran spar-
ingly, Western Carolina ran con-
stantly. The Catamounts had 67
rushes for 267 yards. The relent-
less rushing attack, with plenty of
timely passes, was too strong for
Davidson’s depthless defense to
stop completely. Yet Davidson
did cause three turnovers and
force Western to settle for field
goals twice.

Western Carolina kicker Scott
Roach began the scoring with a
mammoth 53-yard field goal in
the first quarter to give the
Catamounts a 3-0 lead. Western
had to settle for a field goal be-
cause of the determination of
Davidson’s defense.

_,The__ Catamounts _ finally
reached the Davidson end zone.
Western scored a touchdown in
the second quarter on, of all
things, a 6-yard, fourth down re-
verse. The touchdown was the
cumulation of a relentless rushing
attack that gradually wore down
the defense.

Roach ended the game’s scor-
ing with a 32-yard field goal in the
third quarter. Once again the tire-
less Davidson defense forced
Western Carolina to settle for less
than a touchdown.

The Wildcats’ fine showing
against Western Carolina is even
more impressive because David-
son had several key players in-
jured. Senior Horace Manor, in-
jured in a summer auto accident,
has not yet received medical ap-
proval to play. Considering the
seriousness of Manor’s accident,
it is a miracle that he even intends
to play this season. With Manor
back in the line-up, Davidson
would have a potent running at-

tack to complement their new pas-
sing attack.

Defensive captain, junior
Gary Stewart, also missed the
game against Western. Stewart
will miss several weeks due to
mononucleosis.

Davidson showed a lot of de-
termination against Western, a
commodity they will need more of

before the season ends. Strange as
it sounds, the 90-degree heat hurt
Western Carolina more than
Davidson. The Catamounts made
a request at halftime to shorten the
last two quarters by three minutes
each. Coach Gatto denied the re-
quest and the Catamounts faded in
the last quarter despite their mas-
sive use of substitutes, a luxury

Western

Davidson didn’t have.

“I was really pleased with the
team’s effort,” Gatto said, “but
we need to keep improving.”

Davidson gets a chance to im-
prove and even its record against
Gardner-Webb tommorrow at
Richardson Field.

Soocer Team Suffers Three Shutouts On The Road

By ANDY BARRON

Davidson’s soccer team did
not have a pleasant first week.
Three difficult road games re-
sulted in three quick losses, no
Davidson goals, and a dismal 0-3
record.

“We knew the first three
games would be tough,” said
coach Charlie Slagle. “I was hop-
ing to be 1-2 at this point, but it
didn’t happen.”

Richmond began the misery
over a week ago by trouncing
Davidson 4-0. The score was only

1-0 at halftime, but several quick
second half goals and the 97-de-
gree weather put the game out of
Davidson’s reach.

Slagle took the blame for the

~loss.

“I had our team playing the
wrong defense,” Slagle said. “The
midfielders had too much respon-
sibility and had no chance to fulfill
their assignments. We've cor-
rected this problem and I think the
last two games showed considera-
ble improvement on defense.”

William and Mary handed

Davidson its second loss of the
year by beating the Cats 3-0.
Again, the halftime score was
much closer than the final score
(0-0) and a pair of quick goals to
start the second half killed David-
son's hopes of a win.

“There was a period of about
four minutes when the defense
just broke down,” senior Wallis
Goodman said. “They had some
great shots, but we could have
stopped some of their goals.”

On Wednesday, Davidson
played at Wake Forest and lost a

heartbreaker 1-0. Wake’s goal
came only a few minutes before
the end of regulation play.

The important development of
this game was Davidson's im-
proved defensive play. The young
defense handled a powerful ACC
opponent quite well.

“Our team played superbly up
and down the field,” Slagle said.
‘No question that this was our best
game to date. Neither team took
advantage of the opportunities
presented to them. We missed an
opportunity to win the game and

that disappointed me. Still, I was
pleased by our improved effort.”
Davidson debuts at home tom-
morrow after the football game.
The first ever United Carolina
Bank/Davidson Soccer Tourna-
ment will give the Wildcats a
chance to improve their record.
None of the other participants,
Belmont Abbey, Georgia South-
ern or Wofford, match any of
Davidson's first three opponents’
talent. Yet you don’t have to be a
genius to realize that Davidson
can't win if they can’t score.
