Wayne Huckel hastens to the line...

Kivisto, ‘Cats and Kansas

In spite of all of the good qualities of Ohio’s all-
state guard, Doug Hill, who signed with the Wildcats

this week, Lefty Driesell is no doubt still shaking his -

head at the loss of All-American Bob Kivisto, who last
weekend chose the University of Kansas.

‘The flashy Kivisto, labeled by Assistant Coach
Terry Conboy as the “best guard in the country,” had
narrowed his choice down to three schools before mak-
ing his decision. Davidson and Notre Dame were the
runners-up.

in narrowing his offers, he discarded over 200
competing contacts. Discarded along the way were
top basketball powers such as UCLA, Duke, and North
Carolina. But the question which still remained un-
‘answered was “Why Kansas?” ;

In a telephone interview ftom his Aurora, Ill.
home. Wednesday évening Kivisto tried to list his
reasons.

“The basketball programs at the two schools are
very similar,” he said in an obvious effort to make sure
that everyone understood his high regard for David-
son. “Both teams have great.coaches, but there is a
difference in the teams themselves.”

“| was really impressed by the sophomore group at
Davidson,” Kivisto said, “but the freshman group down
there just didn’t have the potential which the Kansas’
freshman team had.”

“I'd like to play with the Davidson sophomore
group, but I'd only have one year of play with them,
while at Kansas I'll be playing with a top team for two
years,” he added.

Kivisto also pointed to the tougher conference
competition which Kansas meets. He said that he feit
the loss of West Virginia would hurt Southern Confer-
ence basketball prestige. In addition, according to the
flashy guard, Kansas will be playing a tougher sched-
ule during the coming years. ;

But Kivisto did like Davidson, and Davidson’s
basketball program.

“The coaching staff impressed me greatly,” he
said. “I guess they were the reason for Davidson being
in my final three.”

“| had always been aware of Davidson basketball,”
Kivisto said. “I was quite interested in college basket-
ball throughout the Hetzel and Snyder days down
there, but I knew virtually nothing about Davidson as
a school.” ;

He gave credit for his visit to Davidson to Assist:
ant Coach Terry Holland. “I met him last fall after a
practice session at school, and I was very impressed.
He got me interested.”

So Kivisto came to Davidson, and he got the full
treatment from everyone. He liked the campus. He
found the Charlotte Coliseum to his liking. Still, he was
most impressed with the coaches. “They impressed me
both as coaches andas gentlemen,” he noted.

But Kivisto went to Kansas. Modestly he says that
he is sure that it won’t hinder Davidson's basketball
hopes. “You have a fine team at Davidson,” he said,
“a fine basketball program, and I'm sure it is going
to continue as a top basketball school. I hope we at
Kansas will have a chance to play against you, perhaps
in a national championship.”

What the Davidson team wil! be like with Hill in
Kivisto’s place is still hard to say. But Kansas sure
won't be hurt by the addition. The 'Cats will miss a
guard who can dribble like crazy, play great defense,
and average 28 points per game. Hopefully Hill will fill
the gap well.

There's always Kivisto’s little brother, who as a
sophomore this year was an all-conference performer.

Better luck next time.

Stevens said that he was
disappointed with the team's
hitting. “We just haven't”

he lamented.

However, to every dark
cloud there is a silver lining,
even in baseball. Says Stev-
