Cinema creates expanding space

By NAT HARRISON
Staff Writer

In the humble beginnings, movies
obeyed a continuity of space and
time.

The films of Lumiere and Melies
incorporated short sequences shot
from the same angle and without any
camera movement. Film time cor-
responded to real time. This was not
because of any particular message to
be expressed but was imposed by the
technology and the very novelty of
the medium.

Gradually, cinema grew up - tech-
nically and artistically. Griffith was
one of its greatest pioneers, and he
was the first to break down the film

into sequences and greatly advances
narrative technique. He is credited
with the first close-up which appears
in ‘‘Birth of a Nation,’’ and
strikes a wave of empathy for the
heroine (it was great!)

He fractures space and thus prod-
uces fiction. Mauraux calls this
destruction of fixed space ‘‘the birth
of cinema as a means of expression’’
and he means that this fragmentation
of spacial unity leads to a dramatiza-
tion.

Hand in hand with this develop-
ment is the birth of cinematic time. It
doesn’t correspond with our everyday
experience of duration, but jumps
about--in a succession of instants.
The duration is articulated - it can be
compressed as in films expression

long periods of time, or expanded as
in the Odessa steps sequence in
Hisenstein’s ‘‘Potemkin.”’

This is a cinema that relies on a
highly developed narrative technique,
a. cinematic vocabulary that took
years to build, and audience assimila-
tion of sophisticated conventions.
However, because we have grown up
with them, these processes tend to
pass unnoticed, especially in Ameri-
can movies since Hollywood has
concentrated on and perfected formal
techniques that are practically invis-
ible unless one consciously looks for
them.

Movies of this type usually tell a
story, relief on a strong dramatic
tempo and have a series of climaxes.
The audience is kept at a highly tense
emotional level throughout. This is
the cinema of Eisenstein, Ford,
Welles and Hitchcock, to name but a
few.

These men were artists who used
those forms to create masterpieces.
They have also been much copied. In
fact, the greater number of the films
made today utilize techniques appro-
priated from the masters but with far
different results; instead of valid
expressive means, they are reduced to
crass tricks of audience manipulation.
For the most part they have become
reduced to formulas of commercial
success and endless cliches which only
increase the environment garbage
that surrounds our lives.

However, in the last two decades,
some filmmakers have moved in new
directions: the themes are new, plots
are sacrificed to metaphysics. and
actual technique or form becomes the
ultimate meaning. There is a tend-
ency towards continuity, not imposed
as-before, but deliberately chosen for
its effects and expressive possibili-
ties.

We have inklings of it as far back as
1948, in DeSica’s ‘‘The Bicycle
Thief,’’ a neo-realist Italian film
characterized by longer shots and
slower rhythms. The move is definite
in Antonioni’s revolutionary master-
tura’’ which came out in 1959.

The narrative displays a continuity
which tries to avoid formal structur-
ing elements. The shots are longer
and more fixed. Time becomes the
essential structural element, not the
fragmented time of earlier classics,
but one of a different nature - closer to
duration as we actually experience it.
We might call it dead time (“temps
mort’’) - meaning unarticulated dur-
ation - to contrast it with the lively
dramatic tempo of the ‘‘suspense’’
films.

One actually feels the slow passing
of time. Essentially, this is what the
filmmakers are striving for as little
analytical structure as possible. In
the words of Henri Agel: ‘‘It is neither
the fragmentation of images nor
discontinuity; it’s the search for
unity.”

This search expresses itself in many
ways. In Resnais and Robbe-Grillet’s
“Last Year at Marienbad,”’ we have
the interplay of mental images and
reality; various pasts, presents and
futures interrelate on the screen. Both
characters and audience seek a way
out of the maze - the film can be seen
as a struggle to resolve this discon-
tinuity. The final liberation is, at a
metaphysical level, the attainment of
unity.

Spacial unity is sought by Hung-
arian director Jaucso in his beautiful
film ‘‘Psaume Rouge’’ (Red Psalm).
Here with no more than 26 cuts
(usually a film will have hundreds,
perhaps several thousand) and a
fantastic choreography of camera and
actors, Jaucso creates a spectacle of
great beauty and, I believe, is more
convincing in his political aims than
Eisenstein’s ‘‘Potemkin.’’ (The sub-
ject matter treats a peasant uprising
of Communistic tendencies in 18th or
19th century Hungary.)

But the importance of this film is
that the director has created a plastic
space that expands and evolves with
the camera movements which them-
selves become the theme as ‘‘sus-
pense’”’ dissolves into continuity and
the ‘‘story’’ loses out to a kind of
meditation. It is interesting to note
that this film was labeled reactionary
by some Marxist critics.

All of these films have fairly
conventional subject matter and it’s
only in relation vo their formal
elements that we perceive their imp-
ortance. Many others could be dis-
cussed but there is another trend that
is parallel and less visible and which
deals with both a formal technical
revolution and a thematic one. The
most well-known, if still quite con-
ventional, of these is Stanley Kub-
rick’s ‘‘2001: A Space Odyssey.”’

Although he uses some standard
tricks for audience manipulation we
also find two of the most pronounced
features of this yet uncommercialized
trend: a preference for cosmic themes

* and in ‘*2001’’ the themes are truly

grand: the evolution of man and
cosmological intercourse - a preoccu-
pation with purely visual effects
which we experience anytime the
images of the film treat ‘‘outer’’
space. The most revolutionary se-
quence is the “spaceship corridor’’
where the astronaut penetrates the
gateway to the stars. This sequence
was filmed with the use of a complex
machine built strictly for this pur-
pose. It communicates a_ purely
sensorial experience.

“2001” is an exception: this branch
of cinema is largely uncommercial-
ized. You won’t find them in Holly-
wood - they are artisans and students
working on their own, usually with
outside jobs. The artist’s tools are
computers, intricate machines, subtle
techniques and personal vision.

They might spend years perfecting
a film that might ultimately be ten
minutes long. They are half mystic,
half-scientist, discovering and crea-
ting and existing. Their films non-
commercial, very personal and para-
doxically are the ultimate in cinematic
form even as they merge into related
media such as video and graphics.

Many have no objective images but
are composed of mobile visual phen-
omena that flows across the screen to
the rhythm of intense personal vibra-
tions. As stars collide with microbes,

we are directed through ourselves into
the universe.

Thus many contemporary film-
makers are shunning storytelling
techniques for a cinematographic
contemplation. They are not inter-
ested in a _ strict realism or a
misconstrued expressionism but ra-
ther strive for a total view of the
universe. They want to touch our
consciousness and call us to wake up.
