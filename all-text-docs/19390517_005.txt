Are Chief Positions
Offered

Many students graduating
this spring will owe their luck
in getting jobs to the place-
ment bureau of the college.
‘Work is being carried on in
the bureau by Dr. P. H.
Gwynn for the placement of
those students who desire to
teach, and through the office
of the registrar, with the co-
operation of Prof. A. M. Hill-
house, for the placement of
those who wish to enter busi-
ness.

Teachers Wanted
A large number of requests have
been received during the spring for
* Public school and _ Preparatory
school teachers. Little difficulty is
4 expected in locating all the men
-who desire to teach next year.
For the past few months inter-
views have been arranged with
seniors in order to discuss their
business prospects. Representatives
from various business concerns
have been sent to the campus to
interview seniors.

Life Insurance

Four life insurance companies
have sent representatives here. Also
agents from such companies as
hy Proctor and Gamble, Tomlinson of
| High Point, and Goodyear Tire
i a, etc., have interviewed seniors.
a F. W. Hengeveld says that

“the prospect of locating interest-
ed seniors in business positions is
better this year than in many years
rast.”

Mr. Hengeveld also said, “It is
sincerely hoped by the college that
the placement byreau will grow in
point of service’ both to the grad-
uating students and to the alumni.”
