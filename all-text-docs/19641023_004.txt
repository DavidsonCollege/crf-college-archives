‘’Cats Sharpen Claws;

1Face Winless Keydets

By MIKE MOOTY
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson’s Wildcats go
after their second win of the
64 season tomorrow as they
travel to Lexington, Virginia
to meet the Keydets of Vir-
pinia Military Institute. The
boys from VMI are still
hunting for their first vic-
tory, having lost all five of
their previous games.

After losing a 14-12 open-
ing shocker to William and
Mary, the Keydets have bowed
to some of the more formid-
able foes on the eastern coast.
One of VMI's best efforts of
the year was a 20-14 loss to
potent Richmond in the sec-
ond game of the season. Vill-
Virginia, and Buffalo
have ail kept Virginia. Military
out of the win column.

One apparent cause of VMI's
lack of success is the fact that
only 14 of last year’s 33 letter-
men return. Also, there has
been a major turnover in the

with one of his highly-touted

coaching staff from last year.
Davidson’s Coach Tom Stevens
and scout is also quick to point
out that “they (VMI have
played some awfully good clubs
and have lost by some real
tight margins.”

The Keydets are expected to
employ a T formation with one
halfback either in the wing
or slot position. Running from
an unbalanced line, they like
to roll and sweep to both sides
and trap with either guard.

The VMI air attack is capa-
bly directed by senior quarter-
back Charlie Snead, brother of
the Philadelphia Eagles’ Norm
Snead.

Joe Bush, co-captain of the
squad and last year’s leading
receiver, and Dan Phlegan, a
6-3 junior end are Snead's
favorite largets. Both Bush and
Phlegan are described by
Stevens as “good, strong, offen.
sive ends."

As Basketball Begins

By TOM COOK
Davidsonian Sports Writer
With slogans such as

“There is no glory in de-
fense, only VICTORY.” and
“Defense is 90% desire.”
posted around the dressin«
room, Davidson’s national-
ly - ranked Wildcats began
pre-season basketball drills
October 15. naturally stress-
ing defense.

Despite eight returning let-
termen, including ‘four starters,
Coach Lefty Driesell. remained
cautious in predicting any suc-
cess for the cagers, with the
comment. “If we don't play
g0od basketball, we cou!d easi-
ly lose 17 games, but we could
win ‘em all if we play good.”

Led by captain Fred Hetzel,
the Witdeats will be missing
only A‘lSouthern Conference
second team forward Terry
Holland, the nation’s field goal

who has joined the Davidson
coaching staff.

with 709 points and 351 -re-

picked to several ‘preseason

Points, Teague did not miss any
of kis field goal attempts and
went five for five at the foul
line also. Playing the point
