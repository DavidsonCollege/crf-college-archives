The Union cafeteria, dining
place for freshmen and
most Independents, has re-
ceived a “C"’ rating from the
North Carolina Department
of Health.

The cafeteria's rating — a

71 — is only two points above
an “F". A Food Service.

grade below 70 results in an
immediate closing of a food

Dr. John R. Platt, a PhD
in physics and associate di-
rector and research biophy-
sicist at the Mental Health
Institute of the University of
Michigan, will deliver Rey-
nols Lectures here Dec. 2-3.
Two members of the David-
son faculty, Dr. Locke White.
associate professor of phy-
sics, and Dr. Alan Brinkley.
associate professor of philo-
sophy, have expressed their
pleasure with the prospects of
Platt’s lectures and said he
has made valuable contribu-
tions to both their fields,
White. a member of the
Public Lectures and the Ar-
tist Series Committee. first
proposed Platt’s name for
consideratiun as a guest lec-
turer at Davidson. He de-
scribed Platt as ‘‘an unin-
hibited thinker who is not
absolutely scientifically
oriented.”

Brinkley has also been im-
pressed with Platt. “I have.
read several of his books.",
Brinkiey said, ‘“‘and he ap-
pears to be a physicist quite
interested in bridging the gap
between the sciences and the
humanities.”

Platt, who is 50, has had a
wide and varied career in
many aspects of the sciences,
including physics, biophysics.
and genetics.

said, ‘because people usually
don't want to eat there.”

A large-scale cleaning job
is needed in the cafeteria,
the inspectors said. They
noted that a bake table fn
the kitchen, for instance, had
green on its corners as 4 re-
sult of insufficient cleaning.

Slater Food Service Man-
ager Klaus Kleeberg request-
ed another examination for
today, but the inspectors said
the cafeteria’s initial grade
could not be changed for 10
days or two weeks.

Kleeberg said his staff
would take all possible steps
to upgrade the cafeteria. Cor-
rections will center mainly
on cleanliness, he said, but
other corrections involving
the physical aspects of the
kitchen will be made also.

The Health Department's
“C" rating is another in a
series of attacks that has,
plagued the Slater manage-
ment in the last few years.

Action Brings Objections
From Jackson, Council

By NORWOOD POLAND
Staff Writer

Application for a permit to
sell beer and wine has been
filed with the State Board of
Alcoholic Beverage Control.
despite attempts by town of
ficials to block it. ‘

Mrs. Colleen Norket. pro
prietor of the Davidson Gro
cery on Depot Street. said
this week she expected a final
decision from the state board
at any time.

The Davidson Town Coun
cil, in an attempt to hamper
Mrs. Norket’s efforts, last
week adopted a_ resolution
opposing it.

The resolution was prompt
ed by a request from the
regional N. C.’ Board of Al-
‘coholic Control in Charlotte.
which made a routine investi
gation of the applicant and
premises earlier this month.

Earlier, when Mrs. Norket
displayed the required notice
of intent to apply for the ap-
plication, Davidson Mayor F.
L. Jackson urged her to with-
draw it...

“He. offered to reimburse
me for the $25 registration
fee I had submitted,” Mrs.
Norket said, ‘*but I told him
that I had already applied
and intended to see the pro-
cess through.”

She said she filed for the :

permit at the suggestion of a
number of students. “‘There
is certainly a market here.
and I don't see why I should-
n't be making the profit on
beer sales instead of some
one out of town.”

The Town Council's reso-
lution is not an ordinance of
prohibition. Jackson said. ‘‘It
is only a recommendation
that the permit not be issued.
There is no mora! question

would make Davidson much
more relevant to society.”

So says sophomore James
Parks, a member of the
president's Commission on
Extra-Campus_ Responsibili-
ties. His opinion reflects a
generally favorable reaction
by many college officials to
the ideas behind the report
of the Five-Year Plan Com-
mittee published last week
in THE DAVIDSONIAN.
However, many felt that the
specifics of the plan need to
be further analyzed.

Dr. Daniel D. Rhodes, pro-
fessor of religion, said that
he felt the college needed ‘to
do some work on the question
of priorities to see where
such a program would fit in.”

H. Edmunds White. director
of admissions, also suggested
that the college needed to
establish some priorities con-
cerning the allocation of
funds before such a program
could be effectively adminis-
tered.

Parks, a Negro student.
said that ‘‘the atmosphere
around here would have to
change before this program
could be a success."' Dean of
Students Richard C. Burts
Jr. also expressed concern
over this aspect of the prob-
lem when he noted a ‘‘signi-
ficantly higher attrition
rate” in the past among such
students as the Five-Year
Plan would seek to attract
to Davidson.”

White pointed to one prob-
lem in the plan as being the
selection of five-year stu-
dents. He said he dislikes the
idea of local selection boards
of ministers or educators un-
less such groups underwent
an intensive training to ac-

quaint them with present ad
missions policies and the cur
rent campus situation.

White also said he feared
that the nebulous criteria
that would have to be used
in the admission of five-year
students would lead to a high-
er dropout rate in that group.

Rhodes emphasized that it
will take time and cautious
study to attempt a five-year
program. “If done wrong.”
he said. ‘this could be worse
than having no program at
all, There would always be
the possibility of doing irre-
parable harm to a man if he
didn't make it, either social-
ly or in the classroom.”

As an immediate action
Rhodes said, “‘We could be-
gin by getting some Negroes
on the faculty.”

J

While Spencer’s Commissions play around
with Parkinson’s Law, Davidson students are

e

invloved. We just don‘t have
the facilities to handle the
kind of situation that could
develop where beer and wine
are sold.”

Although Mrs. Norket’s
permit would not allow con
sumption .on premises. the
presence of a pool hall next
door to the grocery appar
ently worried the council
members.

“I really don't see any rea
son for beer to be sold in Da
vidson,”’ Jackson said. ‘You
can buy it”on both sides of
town. in Cornelius and at
Hattie’s. Why litter up Da
vidson with beer cans?"

The ABC Board in Char
lotte explained that its of.
fice investigates but does not
make recommendations.
“The final decision on the
permit application is up to
the state board in Raleigh,”
a spokesman said.

“The state board could
legally overrule the Town
Council's recommendation if
it so chooses.”

If Mrs. Norket’s request is
denied. she said, she may ask
for a hearing before the state
board. At the hearing she
and-any opponents would be
asked to state their cases be.
fore a final decision is made
on the matter.

ABC Protest
Failed Before

The last time a store owner in this area
applied for a beer-wine permit, it drew consider-
able protest. But the state Board of Alcoholic
Beverage Control approved it anyway.

The application was made several years ago
by Cashion’s Food Stores in Cornelius. It prompted
a hasty alliance of the town’s churches and a
number of petitions, which accumulated scores

of signatures.

_ Approval of the permit by the state board
in spite of the protest was apparently on the basis
of a county referendum authorizing beer, wine

Senate Passes Resolutions

On ROTC, Fewer Chapels

By DANNY WHITE
Staff Writer

In its most productive ses
sion this year the SGA Sen:
ate Tuesday passed a resolu-
tion recommending fewer
chapels with additional stu-
dent cuts and approved a re-
port from its ROTC Commit-
tee concerning the implemen-
tation of the voluntary ROTC
program.

The Senate also voted to
call a second constitutional
convention to further modify
the conflicts between the SGA
Constitution and the Code of
Responsibility and passed a
resolution presented to the
faculty Educational Policy
Committee Wednesday re-
questing. self scheduled
exams.

The chapel resolution, pre

sented by freshman Presi ©

dent Steve Salyer, asks that
the humber of assembly pro-
grams be reduced to. eight
per quarter and that the num-
ber of student cuts be in
creased to 50 percent of the
scheduled programs.

If passed by the faculty.
the above assembly procedure
would become effective in the
spring.

The resolution also creates
a committee composed of
two senators, two members
ef the Union Board. two stu-
dents-at-large, the college
chaplain and one faculty
member to ‘actively solicit
quality speakers and to plan,
coordinate and publicize the
overall assembly program.”

In presenting the resolution
Salyer. chairman of the
Chapel Committee. pointed
out that the attendance re-
quirement was an attempt
to guarantee an audience for
each program.

The ROTC report. passed
as an appendix to the Nov.
5 Senate resolution calling
for voluntary ROTC, was pre.
sented by Stewart Rogers.
The report asks that the drop

cussions in order to decide
whether or not to participate
in the program.

Herd: Constitution Leads
To More Student Voice

By DANNY WHITE

Staff Writer
“TI think that-a year from
now when you look back on
this Senate. you. would have
to say it has been a very
effective body. It has been
able to sway faculty and ad-

ministrative views.”
Speaking is junior Dan
Herd. president of his class
and a member of the power.
ful Senate Executive Com-
mittee (SEC). who had a few
strong comments concerning
student government in an in-

terview. this week...
“Since the new constitu-
tion has been instituted, stu-

the pros and cons of going coed through coed
Free University classes.

dents have had-a much
louder voice in college poli-
cies.” continued Herd. “Be
cause of the constitution. the
faculty ‘have. a new respect
for student government. They
think we're interested and
we're beginning to take the
initiative in areas never ex
plored. by student government
before."

Herd is even more en-
couraged about the fature
role of the Senate now that
it has reached full member
ship. “The old Senate was
hampered in ‘its constitu:
al role until recently because
of this,’ said Herd.

“We can now operate on a
committee basis as the Sen
ate was originally designed.
The committees will do the
investigating but the SEC
must provide the leadership
that Joe Murphy has been
providing.

Herd pointed to the dis-
unity within the student gov-
ernment as the maior prob.
lem facing the Senate. ‘“Stu-
dent government cannot’ be
a reality until all student or-
ganizations are under one
representative body, i.e. the
Senate. The Senate must con-
cern itself with the consolida-
tion of the autonomous stu-
dent governments around
campus.

“Right now, there are too
many organizations operat-
ing too independently. It's
teo hard to organize student
opinion and student action un-
less they are under the juris-
diction of one body which
can provide control which in

+++ More faculty respect

return would bring unity of
purpose within student gov-
ernment.”

Herd also came out for co-
education but he said he
hoped it would take the form
of coordinate campuses rath-
er than a co-ed campus.

Concerning the issues be
fore the presidential commis-
sions, Herd began by saying
he was in favor of subsidized
athletics at Davidson only’ if
the subsidized sport benefited
the college.

“I don’t think we should
subsidize a team if all it's
going to do is draw money
from the college with no no-
ticeable -benefits."’

Concerning campus social
patterns, Herd said he hoped
any change in the éstablished
social system at Davidson
(i.e., fraternities) would be
aimed at increasing the re-
lationships and contacts of
students with other students.
