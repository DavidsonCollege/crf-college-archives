As do all forms of journalism, sports writing runs
the risk of being a dead medium of expression. Of-
tentimes the subject is dead or if it is not, the style
of the account, or even the writer is. The ar-
ticulation of slimy platitudes, reams of statistics
and half-assed apologetic criticism have often
come to characterize the sports copy and naturally,
I hope to avoid these pitfalls.

ches out the core of the sport, the e who par-

an ic and dedicated man. Fagg’s new job at
Georgia Tech is a shot at the big time he values so

highly.

As for Davidson College, the resignation was a
necessity. Fagg began his coaching here in the
shadow of Homer Smith’s impressive record and
understandably, he inherited the desire to win big
from this.

But with the Trustee’s decision to deemphasize
football, Fagg and his staff were burdened with the

As of now, the to inject new blood in-
to football is in our laps, but no one on Fagg’s staff
fills the bill. The coaching ability of these men is
