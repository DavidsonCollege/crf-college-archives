Deal with it re

Flu on Davidson Campus

Davidson Health Center- a
new trend is emerging in student
injuries. Bruised knees, flush
cheeks, and leaves in one’s hair are
not signs of a lovers’ tryst in the
bushes but the results of avoiding
unpleasant social situations.

Freshman Mitch Wiese threw
himself in front of a golf cart after
a particularly embarassing night in
the sophomore apartments

“Diving under a park bench re-
ally works,” attests Helen Richards
*12. “Except for the grass stains
and bruises on my legs, I’m fine. I
didn’t have to speak with him.”

Originally baffled by these
symptoms, health workers soon
realized that another season of
drunken hookups had begun.

“It came a little early this year
and we weren’t exactly ready for
it,” admits nurse Stacy Gunkel. “I
think this year it could become an

English Dept.

epidemic and First Night Down is
still a week away.”

Students have noticed too.

“I saw some unusual behav-
ior,” said Joe Conway, who wit-
nessed a friend’s accident. “Walk-
ing quickly, looking at the ground,
trying not to make eye contact...I
thought maybe he was schizo-
phrenic, but then I realized it was
all because he saw that girl from
last night come into Commons.”

Other witnesses report a
shortening of the breath, a red-
dening of the cheeks, and general
deer-in-the-headlights behavior in
the subject before he or she leapt
sideways into solid wall or came
crashing to the ground under a
park bench. The health depart-
ment asks that anyone who ob-
serves these precursory symptoms
in a friend to kindly grab him or
her and prevent them from falling
down the stairs of Chambers in
their social confusion.

The Center for Disease Con-
trol officially added “Awkward-
ness” to its list of contagious
diseases especially prevalent
among college students, and the
Davidson Health Center intends
to take serious measures to protect
its students.

Questionably

Breaks Hiring Freeze

The English De-
partment has hired
legendary competi-
tive eating champion
Takeru Kobayashi to
fill a recent vacancy.
While he will be
teaching Creative
Writing and Early
British Literature, he
will also be partici-
pating in the hot dog
eating contest spon-

cusations flew that the
English department
only hired Kobayashi
to help them win the
hot dog eating contest.
Shields responded in a
public statement say-
ing “that is preposter-
ous. I can’t think of
anyone better to lead
the Faulkner Seminar.”
However, a few other
comments Shields

sored by the Varsity Kobayashi: 0 parts teach- made were picked up

Field Hockey team.
The English staff have
finished dead last for
the past two years but their latest
addition should help them turn the
tide.

The head of the English De-
partment Robert Shields said
“Kobayashi will bring a wealth
of knowledge and experience to
our faculty. While he doesn’t have
the traditional qualifications such
as a Ph.D or any teaching experi-
ence, he will still be a great asset.”
At the last faculty meeting, ac-

ing experience; 1,000 on microphone. Shields
parts commitment

allegedly said “I can’t
wait to see the Physics
Department go down.
They have ruled the roost for too
long.”

There are reports that the Clas-
sics department is looking to sign
American Joey Chestnut. The Clas-
sics department has not released
any statements, but Chestnut
reportedly taught a 2- Year Humes
course last week. This weekend’s
should be one of the most exciting
Hot Dog eating contests yet.

Davidson College has a

quickly increasing number of new
celebrities on campus this semes-

ter. Vail Commons has chosen
these students through a random
selection process involving the
recipients of a gourmet type of

bacon, and these lucky young men

and women are living the suite
life these days. They have been
moved to President Ross’s man-
sion on Main Street, where they
exist under a veil of secrecy and

are attended to daily by a number

of regular students who use the

opportunity as a work-study pro-

gram.

“My professors all told

me to stop doing my

homework.”

“The New York Times called
me today for an exclusive inter-
view,” bragged freshman Wilbur
Swynn. “We’re all on first-name
terms with the reporters at Good
Morning America, too.”

Paparazzi have been known to
camp out in the front yard, hoping
to capture every sneeze and sniffle
of these new, high-profile students.

“My professors all told me to
stop doing my homework,” added
junior Rose Hamm. “They told me
I should just sleep all the time and
let people bring me things. I’m OK

with that.”

At press time, the number of
students living this mysterious
celebrity life was expected to

triple by next week, for unknown

reasons. The random selection

Major Disappointment:
The Yowl’s Handy Guide

Major: Sociology

Reasons why people choose
this major: White man’s guilt; to
try and have something in com-
mon with Steph Curry; not good
enough for pre-med.

Where they study abroad:
Sometimes, inner-city neighbor-
hoods, third-world countries,
and generally anywhere where
parasites are prevalent. Usually
Cancun.

Career options: Pretentious
documentary film maker; Sociol-
ogy teacher; whatever your rich
father does.

Why people avoid this ma-
jor: They would rather do some-
thing productive with their time.

Description: Sociology ma-
jors are people who want others
to think they care. They drone
endlessly on about all the people
who were, and currently are, hor-
ribly oppressed by the bourgeoisie
WASP males: Native Americans,
African Americans, Hispanics,
Asians, Persians, Polish Ameri-
cans, Irish Americans, Italian
Americans, Jews, Muslims, Catho-
lics, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs,
Baha’is, and women. After learn-
ing about how marginalized some
people in America are, Sociology
majors work hard to teach the
general public. The study of soci-
ology, in fact, does not make one
more sociable.
