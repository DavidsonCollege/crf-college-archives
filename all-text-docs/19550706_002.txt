LETTER TO THE EDITOR:

Dearest Readers:

Have been out to Las Vegas to
see my old friend Noel Coward,

But I will be back on campus
in time for the social event of the
Carolinas Â«~- Summer Frolics at De Ce
I'll be with my intimate friend,
Southern Scandal, from across the
way,

May all your affairs be as
successful as mine,

Louella 0, Linker.

THE LATE COMERS

ED DAVIS comes back to Davidson after
transferring to Chapel Hill at the end
of his Sophomore year, When asked

how he liked Carolina, Ed's only
comment was that a lot more partying
is done there than at Davidson,

WARNER MENDENHALL who will be a Senior
this fall is taking Psychology 22. An
ATO, Warner is commuting to school from
Charlotte where he is building a house
(literally) in the booming Derita section.
This represents just one of Warner's
investments. During the school year he
works at the snackebar and is sometimes
called by his fellow workers "the pride
of the snack-bar." Warner's home is
in Orlando, Florida.

TOMMY RIVERS is up from Charleston, S. C.
for the second three weeks of S. S.
Tommy is going into his Junior year at
Davidson. He has been quite an asset

to the swimming tea.: and his fraternity,
Phi Delta Theta,

PAUL SELLERS comes to Davidson from
Georgetown, S. Ce, and is taking Psy.

22. Paul is an amateur radio operator,
If you should hear strange sounds coming
out of 1 East, it is not Paul talking

to himself, but to one of his radio pals,
Incidentally, Paul is not kin to either
ED or Chuck Sellers,

FRED WALSH has returned to us for three
hours via Psychology 22. He will graduate
at the end of the S. S. Fred has pree
gressively moved from Yankeeland to

the Deep South -= Boston, Charlotte, and
now Atlanta, Georgia. It is easy for
Fred to sport the newest model Chevrolet,
for his father is a Chevrolet dealer,
