D. R. FREEMAN LIKES THE
LIFE AT UNION SEMINARY

Dear Friend: ’
. Was glad to hear from you. I used to
be long on correspondence, but I am liv-
ing in a place now where I find my cor-
respondence gradually dwindling. So
before it dwindles out completely I will
, send you a little message.
I. have been under the keen pressure
“of “somethin’ doin’” all the while since
coming here. To begin with: the spirit
of this place is work, as I have never
known it before. Not that you go to it
as one compelled to; but as I say, the
spirit of the place is “work,” spelled
with capitals, and I’m glad to say I’ve
caught it. It is contagious. The slacker
is not tolerated, or in other words, he’s

service,

I hope to actually be instrumental in
organizing a small band or orchestra
during my sojourn here. Not this year
possibly but by next year when we have
some more of the old guard from D. C.

The D. C. men compose about half of
this student body: 42 out-of a possible
95.

work the students do here—the most

ADVANCE ON. RICHMOND
GAME

The Davidson Wildcats journey to)
Richmond Saturday, where they meet the |
strong Richmond University eleven on
Stadium Field. From all indications the!
Spiders have a very strong aggregation
tiis fall, and the Davidson warriors are |

going to have apts mighty hard if!
they wind up op/the Ie

ee of the

score, ~————
TheRichmond eleven held tha Univer- !
sity of Virginia scoreless in two periods, |

ayd the game finally resulted in a4 too
score in favor of the Charlottesville!
team. Several weeks previous to that
the Wildcats were defeated by the same
eleven 28 to 0. This perhaps looks bad,
but Virginia scored’ in the last seconds|
of play against the Carolina eleven. This |
is going to make the Wildcats fight all)
the harder. Also it will be a big honor
for Davidson to defeat Dobson’s men,
who beat the Catholic University 14 to
to, and held the heavy V. P. I. team so!
well, besides ptzzling the U. of Va. by|
their great defense.

Although the Davidson Varsity will be
outweighed eight pounds to the man,
Coach Grey’s Wildcats can make up
every pound with fight. The men are in
tip-top shape after their frolic on Srpunt
Field last Saturday, and have the con-
fidence and old-time pep. Far is going
to fly when the,Red and Black meets the
Red and Blue. But keep your eye on
the Davidson Wildcats.

JUNIOR-FRESH GAME.

When the Juniors met the Fresh in
the basketball series Friday night, both!
teams were determined to win. When,
the whistle blew they started off with a|
dash and as both teams were in. mid-|
form, it was uncertain at first |
which would be victors. Soon, though, |
the Juniors were able to jump ahead of |
the hard fighting Fresh, by their superb |
passing. The Fresh were unable to!
stem the tide in the second half and
when the whistle blew the fast, Junior |

five had won 38 to 21. The line-up fol-

SOME OF THE WONDERS

OF THE WORLD |

It is seldom that men become engross-
ed in a discussion of women’s clothes.
The garment must be extreme in some
way, either in size, color, texture or
shape to attract more than a passing
glance. But men, like all other rational)
animals, love to see beautiful clothes,
even though they are designed for
women,

I had an opportunity, a short while
ago, to see some of the beautiful
clothes in the ladies’ department of Ed.
Mellons. One article that I was espe-
cially struck with was a fur coat, the
softest of fur, smooth, slick and shiny,
with a gorgeous silk lining. But since
the. selling price of this coat was $950,
I did not care to buy it—just yet. An-
other thing was a suit of silk pajamas,
an exact copy of the suit worn by the
leading lady in a performance at the
Winter Garden last year. The two suits
were designed by the same artist. Ed.
Mellon’s buyer bought this suit to be
used for display only. Still another
article of rare beauty was a satin slip-
per with a jeweled buckle. It just seem-
ed to me that this slipper was entirely
too pretty to be put on the ground by
any foot.

To enumerate all the pretty things
there would take too much space. How-
ever, this will help you ‘to realize, fel-
lows, that Ed Mellon’s is no smali place.
They handle everything in wearing ap-
parel from Boy Scout shoes to silk hats,
