The Plumber Flushes

Hoping to spend next year in
graduate school in Boston, I
have recently been reading
about the history of that great
city. The other day I stumbled
across the story of the Boston
Tea Party.

In that same anthology was
another less-well-known story
entitled the Washington Dope
Party.

So, Listen my children and
you shall hear / Of the
Washington Dope and the
Tricky Year.

The characters in this story
include Dick the Plumber, Pat
the Wife, Warren the WASP,
the Bork, and their cronies;
Southern Sam, Slick Sirica,
Conniving Cox, and their
cronies ; and the Feds.

It just so happened, my
children, that Slick Sirica and
Southern Sam were con-
vincing their cronies that Dick
the Plumber should give over
some merchandise which, ac-
cording to the Plumber, they
had no right to.

Dick the Plumber was
holding fast to his mer-
chandise when, of a sudden, in
rushed the Bork and he cried:
“The Cox is coming! The Cox
is coming! ”’

Dick the Plumber and
Warren the WASP had to
devise a plan quickly. Time
was of the essence, my
children, for Conniving Cox
and Slick Sirica were being
perfectly clear—they wanted
that merchandise.

The Plumber and the WASP
were working on a convincing
argument to present to Con-
niving, Southern and Slick.

It began: ‘‘When in the cour-
se of human events it becomes
necessary for us to withhold
everything, we will. Fur-
thermore, at this point in
history, the general public
should not have access to this
merchandise.”

Pat the Wife entered just as
they were making some real
progress with the
negotiations. She was
carrying a tray with the af-
ternoon tea on it.

Pat the Wife spoke
chastisingly: ‘‘Why don’t you

Sensible Men Cry For Reason
In Corrupt Nixon Decisions

Corruption in government
is nothing new, neither in
theory nor practice.

Consider, for instance, the
following words of Samuel
Johnson (written in 18th cen-
tury England): ‘‘... when fan-
cy, the parent of passion, usur-
ps the dominion of the mind,
nothing ensues but the natural
effect of unlawful govern-
ment, perturbation, and con-
fusion..."’

Johnson’s antidote was sim-

ple, perhaps too simple for the
of the 20th century
America: let reason be
society’s ‘‘lawful sovereign.”
Over the past 200 years, the
United States government has
strayed so far from the paths
of reason that many would say
that we long ago passed the
point of no_- return.

Reason has eluded us,
along with other countries, in
times of crisis.

If the point of no return has,
in fact, been reached, perhaps
it was during the post World

powers, all wary of the others,
suped up their espionage
programs abroad, while at
home they stockpiled their
atomic and store-
rooms.

If indeed the government
was coming from White
Houses and Kremlins, then the
closest of supervision and ad-
vice was emanating from the
military-industrial ents.

This is a trend which has not
been eliminated, although a
heroic effort was on the verge
of being made in the early
1960's. '

Without going into the com-
plex interstices of the
Garrison school of thought (to
which I rigorously adhere),
I'll deem it sufficient to say
that the Kennedy-Kruschev
era was not to last.

At the time of the Kennedy
assassination there were ap-
proximately 17,000 U. S.
troops in Vietnam under the

University and the University of California
followed President Nixon’s decision to fire
Watergate investigator Archibald Cox. About 400
students gathered on Stanford’s White Plaza for a
meeting led by the dean of the chapel Robert Kelly.

Kelly said that President Nixon had set ‘‘a bad

example” for today’s students.

California called for a day of national mourning’

ould close all law schools. They also called
sar eue ten chment of the President and voted to

send a delegation to Washington to lobby for im-
peachment.

Even after Nixon anounced that he would turn
over the Watergate tapes to a federal judge,
students at Duke University, Florida State Univer-
sity, and the University of North Carolina staged
rallies to demand the President’s impeachment.
Reaction on other campuses came mostly in the
form of petitions.

guise of ‘‘advisory capacity.”

Forty-eight hours or so into
the new administration, the
newly christened President
Johnson met with Henry
Cabot Lodge and committed
full U.S. support to the cause
of South Vietnam.

Five years later, we were
inextricably involved in a war
to the tune of 500,000 troops.

And then there was Nixon.

Nixon established civilian
control over the military with
various ‘‘check and balance’”’
institutions.

He was able to accomplish
gradual withdrawal saving
the icing of the cake for elec-
tion time.

Even at that very time, ten-
sion was mounting in the Mid-
dle East.

And now the Middle East is
over. Nixon’s recent response
to the Middle East crisis — i.e.,
the national alert - was
viewed by many as a
maneuver to get the American
public, however briefly, off his
back with respect to
Watergate.

National response to this
situation was commendable;
the people of America began
to call for a return to an age of
reason.

And the incentive is easy to
see. More and more, we, the
‘fellow Americans,” are sub-
jected to phrases as “the
United States wants this” or
“American policy is such and
such.” Have we let ourselves
become literally as well as

grammatically a “third per-
son?”’

What voice have we had in
ranking members have recen-
tly been drawing convictions
faster than the Nazis did at
Nuremburg?

What part have we been
able to play in the tragic plight
of a President who has not
satisfactorily ‘‘vindicated his
ways’’ tous?

O Reason! ‘Come down
from yonder height.”’ If we
must shun this “wavering
man, betrayed by venturous
pride,”’ then let us shun him.

And remember, of those
“four more years,” there are
still three long ones left.

just give some to Sam; I can
always buy more on the street

in Georgetown.’’ Seeing the
tea and hearing these words,
the Plumber's devious mind
put together an ingenious
plan.

The first phase was to give
the stuff over to Southern Sam
at precisely the correct
moment. The Bork was to per-
form the first step.

Late one evening when
Southern Sam was waiting for
his wife to vacate thebathroom
so that he could take a bath,
the Bork entered, mer-
chandise in hand.

Southern could not wait to
use the stuff. But Dick the
Plumber also knew that
Southern could never put off
his bath.

Southern Sam played right
into the Plumber's hand. He

took It to the bathroom to use
while he bathed.

cronies were dressing up as

... Perverted Politics

(Continued from page 5)

Augustine, ‘‘. . . an unjust law is no law at all."

Dr. King believed that one is morally obligated to obey just
laws and morally obligated to disobey unjust laws. He un-
derstood that in disobeying a law he believed to be wrong, he
was consequently obligated to bear whatever punishment the
uninformed state demanded in payment.

Kar] Barth in his ‘Church Dogmatics’”’ (III 4) makes the same
case in regard to the selective conscientious objector : ‘The man
who objects to military service must be prepared to accept
without murmur or complaint the consequences of the in-
subordinate form of his national loyalty. . .the penalty of his
violation of the existing law and constitution.”

The point Mr. Magruder failed to comprehend, a point that
would justify his failing Coffin’s ethics course, was simply that a
tremendous gap exists between open disobedience and secret
disobedience to law; between breaking the law to test its con-
stitutionality and breaking the law for political reasons.

The Watergate cover-up clearly shows that the last result
those who were involved wanted was for their violation of the
law to be exposed.

More recently other witnesses in the Watergate hearings have
argued that they believed their actions were justified in the in-
terest of national security. Even this high motive does not ex-
cuse the underhanded way they acted upon their alleged
patriotic conviction.

While only the end can justify the means used to attain it, the

end in no sense justifies every possible means. Some means sim-
ply cannot be justified.

More than the Watergate defendants are on trial today; the
law of the United States is on trial. Generally the nation’s laws
have served well in defending and protecting its citizen’s lives,
property, and essential freedoms while assuring the orderly
conduct of society.

In recent years specific laws have been tested by persons like
Dr. Spock or the Catonsville Nine whose goals were not personal
gain, but changing the laws of society. These lawbreakers are
clearly in a separate category from common criminals; yet the
law has been proven adequate if not sympathetic in resolving
their cases.

The issue before the country now is whether the law can justly
try the equally nontypical lawbreakers whose violations as
lawyers and political

Indications are that the law is sufficient to meet this crucial
test. No man is above the law whether he be a common thief, a

un ws, or a politician acting covertly to protect the
against unspecified enemies. eed

As long as the goddess of justice remains blindfolded, justice
will be enacted with reasonable equity. If that blindfold slips and
men in high office gain preferential exemption from the law,
then the United States will have entered the ippy era of the
rule of men rather than the rule of law. This must not :

If law prevails, then the chances are favorable that the United
States can embark. upon its next two hundred years as a rocky

_ but enduring constitutional republic.
