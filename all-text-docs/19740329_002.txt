Dr. Amelia Dockery has

Laundry Suggests Transition
To Non-Compulsory Charge

By WAYNE GULLEDGE
Staff Writer

(Ed. Note: The following

in response to Steve Canter-
bury’s column last week.)

It might be quite the usual
thing next year to see David-
son men cowering before
whirring washing machines,
overcome by the ‘‘cold, warm
and hot” dilemma. In fact, if
the laundry is eliminated as
has been suggested, the sight
might become a com-
monplace.

That inequities exist in the
payment of the laundry fee is
undeniable. Men lack the op-
tion of doing their own laundry
and thereby avoiding the fee.

It would be unfair to force
everyone to pay the fee, if
some sincerely object to it.
But phasing out the laundry
service completely has _ its
drawbacks.

. First, by doing one’s own
washing, it will be possible to

save money, but. the
possibilities have been
exagerated.

Considering that time is
money at Davidson, doing
one’s own laundry actually in-
volves the expenditure of
some capital. Since most
women spend at least one half
hour each week washing
clothes, the time thus spent
over the course of the year ef-
fectively eradicates money
conserved otherwise, if it is
taken to be worth the
minimum wage.

Persons participating in
athletics or other ex-

to do a load of laundry.

And there are very few men
who could easily turn out the
finished shirts that the laun-
dry now does.

An alternative to the
abolition of the laundry is the

fee. Granted,
there would be an element of
financial risk, but by
registering students at the
very beginning of each year,
inefficiency can be
minimized. The laundry is
already in the process of

scaling down its operations ac-
cording to Laundry Manager
Frances Beaver.

With a smaller staff, the

point-average.
The SGA ad hoc committee
on grading policy, chaired by

costs, it is not surprising that
the laundry is running in the
red. But losses last year ap-
peared to have been more
serious than, they actually
were. Salary increases and
new equipment purchases
combined to create an ab-
normally large deficit.

Many students find doing
their own laundry  ob-
jectionable as well as
prohibitively time-consuming.
They are entitled to the option
of having it done for them no
less than those who object to
the fee are entitled to the
machines.

With good management, it

possible for Davidson’s
laundry to make the transition
to non-compulsory fees.

Alteration rather than

should be the
focus of our efforts.
