Former mayor Gantt gives praise and advice

NC senatorial candidate tells 11th Hour audience to carry on King’s work

By JAY CHAUDHURI

Harvey Gantt, former mayor of Char-
lotte and prospective senatorial candi-
date for North Carolina,spoke for Elev-
enth Hour last Thursday.

In recognizing Martin Luther King,
Jr.’sbirthday that week, Gantt elected to
speak on “Black Americans and their
place in this country.”

Incelebrating the past, Gantt said that
as a youngster he had heard stories of
ordinary black men and women who

displayed courage and heroism. It is

their accomplishments that Gantt re-
members most vividly.

“They had to be mentally tough,
physically strong, and believed in
something beyond themselves,” said
Gantt. “The factis, we’ ve survived slav-

ery and that is to be celebrated. We had
very little in formal education yet we’ ve
done well. And there’sa lot tocelebrate,
especially the daily struggleof ordinary

’ citizens.”

In this respect, Gantt wanted to re-
member King not as a martyr or for his
great speeches, but rather “as a man, a
human being, an ordinary middle class
folk, anindividual who moved millions
of people.”

However, according to Gantt, prob-
lems still exist in black America. “While
we've come a long way, there’s a lot of
things we need to do,” he said. “We’ve
come a long way in elimating the ves-
tiges of second-class citizenship, but
there is reason to be concerned even at
the height of economic and political

power.”

These dilemmas can be traced to “the
swing of the political pendulum.”
Currently, said Gantt, the pendulum is
Swinging to right, fueled by the reli-
gious right.

The way to counter this “swing” will
require the participation of African-
Americans. “We need to find a way of
linking the middle and upper class in-
telligentsia blacks with the lower class,”
proposed Gantt.

Racial problems also exist because
there is not enough honest discussion
between the races. This has resulted in
“a growing gap between the whites and
blacks,” he said.

The solution to these racial tensions
should be a total community effort,

however, the real responsibility lies
with black Americans, said Gantt.
“There is a need for black America not
to forget their roots, especially those
who are moving up,” he said.

Gantt then wentontociteanexample,
saying that an educated, affluent law-

yer should tutor someone in church

rather than play golf. It is this kind of
attitude that is needed to bridge the gap
among the races, said:Gantt.

“We have to make that effort. We
have tobe leaders in that process and in
devising government and public pol-
icy,” he concluded.

Although Gantt hasn’t officially an-
nounced his candidacy for the Senate
position, he is “deep in deliberations
and close to doing it.”

‘High tech computer classroom hit campus

New computers will ease shortage

By: SU ' p

A new com pittier facilities
room recently opened on
third floor Chambers. The
installation of 21 student

instructor terminal marks a
new development for
Davidson College. Now pro-
fessors fromany department
will be able to use computers
as an integral part of their
lesson

ence

IBM-55. terminals and one.

“Thé “computers ‘Were in-~
stalled to meet the needs of
instructors. Assistant Director
of Academic Computing Sue
Varga-Ward said, “The faculty
needs tohavea facility toshare
ideas with students in an elec-
tronicenvironment.” Allof the
IBMs are currently hooked up
to the network. This network
enables computers to share
data.

The instructor terminal al-

“lows the professor sor to-access —

data from any student’s
screen. “Instead of walking

around the room and looking -

over shoulders,” said Varga-
Ward, “the professor can call
up any student's screen on his
or her terminal. The professor
can then see where the prob-
lem is and cause an answer or
suggestion to appear on the
student's screen.” In addition,
the professor can send one stu-

dent’s*screen to everyone or
display a screen on the over-
head projector.

The computer room will be

closed to students during the —

day in order to allow profes-
sors flexibility in using the
room. Professors can either
schedule their classes in the

room foran entire term, use the

room on an irregular basis or
bring their students in on the
spur of the moment. The com-

puter center has’ sponsored —
demonstration classes for |
professors throughout the |
term to encourage the room’s
use. Networks to individual |
officesand other buildingsisa
long-term option.

Students are allowed to in-
dependently use the room
from 5 to 11 each night. There
will be a student assistant in
the room as well as several
computer service manuals. 4
