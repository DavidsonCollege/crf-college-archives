The faculty apartments, lo-
cated behind the Carnegie
Guest House, will be used for
student housing next year,
while Park Place will become
faculty apartments, according
to Director of Student Hous-
ing Scotty Nicholls. Park
Place, a duplex located on
Concord Road, has housed
students on the past few
years.

Nicholls aaplaihad’ the deci-
sion as a move to locate
students on campus ‘while
placing faculty in Davidson
residential sections.

Recommiendation To Amend Article IV, Balescaph 5

As a college dedicated to the service of God and man aioe

a free and open search for truth and knowledge, Davidson

welcomes. dedicated men and women of all persuasions to its

Administration and Faculty. Furthermore, as a church-related
institution, Davidson recognizes that it is called to witness ‘to

| the Christian faith in the realm of higher education. The
President is therefore charged to recommend for appointment as
officers and Faculty members men and women who [1] are
professionally competent, [2] are of high moral stature, and [3]
can live in harmony with the basic purposes of the College as

reflected in the Constitution.

Trustee resolution

Resolved, that paragraph 5 of Article IV be and it hereby is

amended to read as follows:

“8. It is natural and désirable that the educational service of a
church-related College should be carried forward from one
generation to another by persons comrhittee to the faith of its
founders. The Christian commitment of a church-related College
is re‘lected not only-in its corporate policies, programs, and
stewardship of resources, but especially'tn the lives of the
individuals who make up its community. For that redson, the
President is authorized to recommend for appointment as
officers and Faculty members Christian men and women who are

not only highly competent but who understand and respond to

the implications of their commitment as Christians. The

President is also authorized to recommend for appointment as

officers and Faculty members non-Christian persons of genuine
spirituality, who can work with respect for the Christian
tradition even if they cannot conscientiously join it, and who can

live in harmony with the purpose and policies a the Colese.. as

set forth in the Davidson College Constitution.’

“T think anybody who has .

lived in the apartments has a
different idea,” she said about
Terry's plan to house five
students in each apartment.

. The final decision will come
from the consensus opinions of
Nicholls, Terry and Business
Manager Robert A. Currie.

The apartments will be
placed on the lottery and
available only to seniors ac-
cording to Nicholls.

Perimeter housing is not

available to underclassmen be- .

cause they can hold an entire
house year to year. Nicholls
wants all houses to be in the
lottery yearly.

“I think (housing students
in the faculty apartments) will
be good because it offers an

; ag ee . ® ness
option we didn’t offer before.

These are reasonably nice
SPOTSTOROE,

“One of the biggest plusses
of these’ places is that you can.
live with a few of your
friends,” said Nicholls.

She said parking behind the
apartments will be ‘probably
what (the students living in
them) will do, but that will
have to be something the
parking committee will nave
to decide." ?

.. faculty clarifies b y-law

[Continued from page 1}
the faculty recommendation,

| voiced additional objections to

the language of the Trustees’
resolution.

“The resolution says that ‘it
is natural and desirable that
| the educational service of a
church -related college should
be carried forward.. etc.’ That
seems very well set out.

(But) ‘the question of ap-
pointing non-Christians to the
faculty seems to be an appen-
dage added on the end of the
statement...the groundwork
for justifying the appointment
of non-Christians does not
seem to be very well set out,”’
Rice said.

Professor of History Wil-
liam Brown Patterson, the
third co-author of the faculty
recommendation, said that it
aims to eliminate all religious
requirements for hiring and
tenure.

He maintained that phrases
in the Trustees’ resolution like
‘genuine spirituality’ still re-
flect a religious. requirement.

One part of the faculty
recommendation says that the
‘President should recommend
for appointment men and wo-
men who can live in harmony
with the basic purpose of the
college as reflected in the
Constitution.’

Maydole explained this
clause: ‘“‘That Davidson Col-

presidents comment on rules

tion here at Davidson. The
process of self-selection seems
to me the best way to go about
choosing a place to be a part of
for your Davidson years."

PAX President Jane Childs
added, ‘‘We sympathize with
the problems of the fraterni-
ties but we think it is possible
to work within the system."

The national fraternity
presidents also stated that
they found no problem in
remaining within the system
but they would like to have a
greater say in who joins the
fraternity.

PIKA President Randy
Sherrill said that while his
house thought that “*the philo-
sophy of self-selection is fairly
good,"’ he would like to see the
system allow the fraternities
have more of a say in the
decision of who joins the
house.

Christopher, who is also

was personally in favor of
self-selection, ‘‘because it
tends to prevent any kind of
factionalizing in the college.
One thing that has discour-
aged elitism at Davidson is
self-selection."

Vance added that a ‘‘sub-
stantial minority"’ of the mem-
bers of KA support that view.
‘‘l think most people at KA
are not violently opposed to
self-selection.’’ he said.

SAE President Jud Bryan
said that he was somewhat
confused by the recent devel-
opments but added thatvhis
fraternity wanted to- coexist
with the eating Houses in the
present system.

“Our house is not-trying to

push for a 1969 type of bid
system,"’ he explained.
President of Phi Delta The-
ta Ted Pappayliou agreed with
those sentiments and said that
he hoped that the Trustees will
not overact and abolish frater-

nities at. Davidson.
“If you run a smart pro-

gram you can get who you
want:down to the house with-
out breaking the rules and
having to discourage people,”

he said. ;
Meanwhile it appears that

the college will retain its
present system of self-selec-’
tion for the time being while
the subcommittee and the
Advisory Council continue to
work out the fine details of the

proposed system.

president of KA, said that he

lege is a Christian institution
is one of the basic ideals
expressed in the Constitution
and Statement of Purpose.”
“I think a person can live in
harmony with this without
having to respect the entirety
of the Christian tradition.
That means, as I understand
it, that a person is not going to

' try to change Davidson from a

church-related college to a
secular college, that a person
is not going to try to eliminate
the presence of Christian min-
istry on campus, that a person
is not going to try to eliminate
funds that now go for main-
taining and increasing Christ-
ian institutions and organi-
zations on campus.’

“To livé in harmony with
something does not entail that
you agree with everything or
even that you respect every-
thing, but it means that you're
not going to be an iconoclast,
that you're not going to be
destructive,” commented
Maydole.

‘‘T admit that the phrase
(‘live in harmony’) is not as
clear as it otherwise might be,
but it certainly a lot better
than the other." (the Trustees’
resolution)

All three co-authors of the
faculty recommendation hope
the Trustees will consider
carefully the by-law revision.

‘‘What we have to do now is
make sure that we.do not
return to a policy which is
a simple rephrasing using
vaguer language from the way
it was originally,"' said May-
dole.

“With an issue as delicate

as this you ought to make it
(the by-law) crystal clear so
that nothing gets misinterpre-
ted. To leave things in a vague
or ambiguous state is simply

to invite misinterpretation, .

he said.

Patterson feels that ‘‘now is
the time to take a careful look
at the thing, because chances
are we will have it for a long
time to come,”

Rice, a professor at Wil-
liams College last year, viewed
the Christian Tenure contro-
versy last spring from an -
outside perspective, and he
sees the: Trustees’ task as an
especially urgent one.

‘I cannot minimize the da-
mage that the events of last
spring did Davidson in the
eyes of outsiders not familiar
with the parameters of the
difficulties,” he said. —

“IT would like us to embrace

the opportunity to make a

strong and affirmative invita-
tion to non-Christians to join
this community."

The faculty recommenda-
tion is a revision of a state-
ment drafted last spring by
the Executive Committee of
the faculty.

Rice said that both docu-
ments uphold the principle of
removing religious require-
ments for tenure. Of the two
versions spelling out that
principle, the faculty felt the
recent revision to be clearer
and more straightforward,

The- Executive Committee
of the faculty will meet with
the Trustees Executive Com-
mittee and present the fac-
ulty's recommendation,
