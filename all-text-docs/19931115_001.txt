Trustees vote:
college can
invest in
South Africa

By Susan Warren
& College Relations

In 1987, South African tur-
moil caused: Davidson students to
express concern about College in-
vestments supporting companies
who were not following the
Sullivan Principles. Due to the
concern, the Trustees enacted a
policy banning the ownership or
purchase of shares of South Afri-
can corporations.

The policy was considered
necessary due to the situation “con-
stituting a compelling moral con-
sideration in the management of
thecollege’s investments,” accord-
ing to the Trustees.

Thanks to Nelson Mandela
and no student groups opposed to
investments in South Africa any-
more, Davidson Trustees repealed
the policy banning investment in
South Africa in their October meet-
ing.

Trustee Larry Dagenhart
spoke of the now extant policy as
“We didn’t goas far as some people
did in banning investments, but we
took a stand that we thought was
about right. It was a great issue for
along time, and now it has become
history.”

Though a lot of money was
never invested, the principles
Davidson College students be-
lieved in were shown by the Trust-
ees actions.

and David Lindsay, and donors, Julie Ferguson and Megan Snyder.

Bone Marrow Drive, #1 in NC

By Court McBryde

Davidson College’s Project
Life organization will mark its
fourth annual Bone Marrow Drive
on November 17, 1993 in the
Morrison Room of the Union from
9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Project Life is a student led
effort to increase the National Bone
Marrow Donor Registry. Once a
person’s name is on the Registry
they have the potential to become a
donor for victims of chronic leuke-
mia, aplastic anemia, and other dis-
eases now commonly treated by

bone matrow transplantsye%e --

Acommittee of Davidson stu-
dents convenes weekly to plan and
discuss the drive. Sophomore mem-
ber of the committee, Anne
Tilghman McEaddy, feels that the
main goal for this year’s drive is to
inform and educate freshmen and
upperclassmen, who have not vol-

Calendar causes controversey

By Mary Clare Jalonick

When the Faculty Executive
Committee made the decision to
add another day to the exam pe-
riod, they did not expect the reac-
tion that they got from students
and parents.

During parents weekend, par-
ents were asked to mail in protest
postcards to the committee. They
pointed out that the late release
dates for winter break prevent stu-
dents from spending valuable time
with their families, finding part
time work, and traveling long dis-
tances.

The “concerned parent” who
wrote the protest note ends it with
“we hope that such an oversight on
the part of the college will not
happen again.”

Dr. Sandy McKelway, the
elected secretary of the committee
who is in charge of the calendar,
says “we are alittle surprised at the
heat.”

According to McKelway, the
faculty added an extra day to the
exam schedule in order to appease
student complaint that the exam
period was too short. They con-
sider the day optional. “No one
needs to use it if it isn’t conve-
nient,” he says.

Davidson uses a 14.6 week

semester instead of a 14 week se-
mester like some schools, and
shortening the semester is not, ac-
cording to McKelway, even up for
debate. Thus, the only solution to
the problem is to have school start
earlier.

Semesters also must begin on
Mondays, therefore school would

have to be pushed back into Au-’

gust an entire week. If semesters
could begin on other days, then the
problem might be more easily
solved. McKelway, though, de-
scribes the semester beginning
mid- week as “awkward.”

Another solution would be to
eliminate fall break, but the faculty
realize that this idea would not be
too popular with students.

The calendar is set for the
next two years already, and the
situation is not much different in
years to come. Winter break is set
to begin on the 22nd in 1994, and
the 21st in 1995. It will continue to
go back one day for the next sev-
eral years.

McKelway says that the fac-
ulty is “caught between a rock and
ahard place.” He stresses that since
they will not extend winter break,
something is going to have to give.

New eating

houses

only in planning stages

By Lexy Devane

Despite various rumors inun-
dating campus, plans for a new
Patterson Court house are only ten-
tative.

Currently, two. different
groups are working on the prelimi-
nary procedures necessary before
any concrete decisions can be made
by the Campus Committee on Re-
ligious Life (CCRL) and the Patter-
son Court Council (PCC).

One group wants a fourth fe-
male eating house for Patterson
Court. The other group wants to
create aco-ed eating house. Both
groups hope to be on the Spring
Self Selection ballot and move in
toa renovated Pax house next year.

Approximately 20 students
gathered last Thursday, Novem-
ber 11, in an open forum setting to
discuss plans for the female eating
house. The Dean of Students’ of-
fice requires 40 definite members
before granting acharter. Although
interest has appeared abundant, the
required 40 members has not yet.
been met. Efforts are currently
underway to gain the support.

strating the need for more options

for women on campus. We are

McGeorge Bundy, once national security advisor, spoke Monday.

N'tl Security Advisor speaks
on U.S. mistakes in Vietnam

By Sally Stone

In former National Security
Advisor McGeorge Bundy’s
speech on “Vietnam: Looking
Back, Looking Forward,” he-ad-
mitted that Vietnam was indeed a
mistake.

As the 1993 Wearn lecturer,
Bundy spoke to a full audience on
Monday evening, November 8. His
lecture detailed his reflections on
the United States’ involvement in
Vietnam and the lessons to be
drawn from the war.

A cabinet level advisor for
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson,
Bundy was involved in multiple
foreign policy decisions, includ-
ing the Bay of Pigs and Cuban
Missile Crisis.

Describing Vietnam as “the
most painful single event in for-

eign policy in all the years of the
Cold War,” Bundy dismissed the
easy conclusion that we should not
have been there in the first place.
Only in retrospect are certain key
factors evident.

freshwomen and hope that they
will be an instrumental part in our
establishing this fourth house on
campus,” explained initiator
Allison Sabel.

“Tt is important for current
houses to understand, however, that
our goal is to provide more repre-
sentation and options on Patterson
Court, not to close any of the exist-
ing houses.”

This concern regarding the
start of a new house and the close
of an old one, leaving the court the
same as it was before, roots from
the past opening of Connor and
folding of Spencer. Many students
fear this will happen between the
new house and Warner Hall. How-
ever, the members of Warner Hall
do not believe this will occur.

“Warmer Hall is financially

secure, despite various rumors.
Although this has been a tough
semester because of the small num-
bers, members have shown. an
amazing amount of enthusiasm and
taken full advantage of the small
numbers to become closer. I be-
lieve the house fully supports a
new eating house and wishes
Allison [a current member of
Warner Hall] the best of luck with
it,” stated: House Treasurer ‘Lara
Onkey.

Patterson Court advisor Kurt
Holmes agrees that a new house
opening and an old one closing is
not an effective option. Holmes
stated that if a new all women
house is started, all three existing
houses will be affected.

However, he hopes both ef-
forts will make Patterson Court a
more accessible option for students
who are currently not affiliated
with any of the houses on Patter-
son Court. The student involve-
ment on Patterson Court usually
fluctuates between 50 to 65%. Last
spring, house membership was
around 55%.

The other effort Holmes re-
ferred to is the co-ed house move-
ment. The plans for “McKee”
house, named after alumnus who
is a North Carolina State Senator,
have been headed up by Jonathan
Orr and Samantha Hackett. They
hope to provide a completely dif-
ferent alternative for students
through anon-rushing environment
for male members and a variety of
