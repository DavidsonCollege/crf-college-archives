Opera Company, the Detroit Civic
Opera Company, the Philadelphia
Grand Opera Company, and others.

Mr. Pier spent six years of study
and teaching in Europe, being a stu-
dent at the London Conservatory and
acting as assistant teacher to Jacques
van Lier, celebrated modern virtuosi
of the 'cello. His professional experi-
ence has included membership in the
London Symphony Orchestra, Convent

Garden Opera Orchestra, Russian Bal- |

let Orchestra, Rio de Janeiro Sym-
phony, and the Buenos Aires Opera

and Symphony. He has also had con-
cert tours in Europe, South America,
and the United States.

down; Newsome scored four of the
Christian tallies.

featured by long runs by backs, who

One sign which was situated on the
branches of a tree, announced “Free
parking space for cars,” while a “La-
dies’ Rest Room” sign reposed in the
front yard of Dr. Lingle’s house until
recovered early next morning by a
respectable student of the college. Ap-
parently not satisfied with their ef-
forts, the boys decided to give the
managers a little workout the next
day by rearranging the ticket booths
according to their tastes, Fraternity
house windows suffered a complete
whitewashing to the chagrin of the
pledges the next morning,

Several freshmen took to the lava-
tories in a last final effort to recovér
their clothes and furniture from under
the showers and_ faucets,
others by locked doors and in
darkened rooms and thus escaped, for
the most part, the various processes
of going through the “ mill.”

However, two freshmen, who were
particularly careful about locking their
rooms, were placed in an embarrassing
position when they discovered that a
coat hanger had been put in the key
hole, and as a result they could not

turn the key. Only after receiving
outside aid, were. they able to open
the door.

Rumple Dormitory provided an ex-
cellent battleground for several water
fights, and the participants were thor-
oughly drenched when they had fin-
ished. Another boy suffered growing
pains when he perceived his pyjamas
making a “bee line” for the door.
With a flying tackle, he managed to
stop them, and after investigation, dis-
covered the automotive power to con-

sist of one black and white-colored
cat.
The next morning many sleepless

faces were in evidence, but in spite of
this everyone seemed to have enjoyed
the excitement and fun,

“Davidson is known throughout the
country for its ,splendid debating
teams, and this year the Davidson rep-
resentatives should be as strong as
ever. With the backing of the student

During the years of depression no

effected by the school, in spite of the
fact that running expenses have been
curtailed. All teachers
