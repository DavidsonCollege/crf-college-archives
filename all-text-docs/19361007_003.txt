Dr, Rowan stated that the first
verse of the Psalm had been mis
interpreted. He held to the trans
lation by the late William Me-
Pheeters: “The Lord is my shep-
herd, | do not want.” The trans

lation. of the King James’ version,
“IT shall not want,” states a predic
tion of the future, something that
the author of the song in no way in-
tended. Had prophecy been Davy-
id’s intention, criticism of his words
would be possible by agnostics; in
McPheeter’s version, no.criticism of
David's statement of present condi
