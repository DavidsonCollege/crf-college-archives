The Junior Year Abroad
program (JYA) in Marburg,
Germany is using a resident
German as advisor, Jurgen E.
Schlunk. instead of a faculty
member. for the first time this

Not only is this cheaper than
moving a member of the faculty
and his family. but it also
provides the students with an
adviser better oriented to

Therefore. a person must do a

Fisher said that the college
conducted a survey last year
among the students who had
been abroad for the vear

The survey indicated that
each student had different
readjustment problems. and

there was no specific thing the
college could do to help ease the
cultural shock. Each student
must cope with the problem
himself. Fisher said

Students on the foreign study
program adapt to a different

Ronald Altman. who studied
in Germany last vear. said that
students worry about a quality
education abroad in contrast to
one based on quantity here.

His opinion of the most
important aspects of his vear in
Germany reflect this feeling

First and most important was
personal independent study.
Secondly. travelling was
valuable.

Altman said that often classes
were only held once a week. so
this left a good deal of time to
see other places. Seeing the
different lifestvles and cultures
helped one to keep an open
mind.

He commented that a great

Some wonder why the vear

Altman feels that this would
be a mistake. for the sophomore
year is a time to form and
deepen friendships. “It is
important to establish yourself
here. he said

One of the main complaints
about the Junior Year Abroad
program is that the different
department chairmen are not
detailed enough in their
requirement specifications.

This makes it hard on the
students when they return. for
they are evaluated by the
professors at Davidson, not the
ones who instructed them.

Fisher feels that the students
are mostly to blame in this
area. however. He said that if a
student keeps in touch and
writes back through the proper
channcis he will get specific
instructions

cases, he said.
