The annual fall tennis tournament for the
singles championship of Dayidson began on

beginning of the finals.
There is an unusually large number of

contestants this year, there being some ex-
cellent prospects in the present Sophomore
Class. Six of these Sophomore contestants
formed the nucleous of
Freshman team last year, and although none
is expected to play in any way dramatically,
they will be the ones upon whom the varsity
team will build for next year.

A beautiful silver loving cup has been of-
fered to the winner in this singles tourna-
ment, and with the large field of candidates,

few are willing to. venture speculations as to

the possible winner of the, cup.

Through an arbitrary seeding of players,
a tentative ranking of the first six players
has been set in order as follows: DuBose,
Poe, S. McLean, M. Roddey, D. Calder, and
D. Rusk, Harrison, Spencer, Myers, Me-
bane, Lake, and many other likely pros-
pects compose the rest of the field of candi-
dates.

Dr. Lacy Denounces

Sins of the Soul Ruin Many Lives

In the morning chapel services conducted
by Dr. Ben Lacy, he appealed to the spirit
of the Davidson men to help him make the
meeting a success. He likened it to the way
in which the yV. M. I. cadets back anyone
who is approvtd by the corps.

The morning text was taken from the thir-
teenth chapter of Corinthians, the great love
chapter. In his talk he brought out the fact
that the sins of the soul were emphasized
much more than the sins of the body. While
these sins will not be known to everyone,

they will ruin more lives and are much hard-

er to conquer.

He emphasized the sins of ambition, pride
and covetousness, stating that the sin of

pride in his day was one of the outstanding |

sins of the campus.

“Ambition,” he said, “is the sin that be-
sets all wide-awake Americans, and it is one
that the Davidson men have to fight.” Often

men are willing to ruin men’s lives to sat-

isfy their own ambitions and help them at- |

tain their wishes.

Dr. Lacy stressed particularly the sin of
pride, which, he said, applied more to men
at Davidson than any of the other sins.
“Pride goeth before a fall and a haughty
spirit before distruction.”

Plan Work for Year

Eumenean and Philanthropic
Societies Have Many New
Members

. The two literary societies of the college,
Eumenean Literary Society and the  Phil-
anthropic Literary Society, have begun a
seemingly successful year, Both societies have
received many new men, these consisting
chiefly of Freshmen. Also, both organizations
have many well-trained orators and debaters
which promise many interesting and instruc-

tive programs.

Last Tuesday night the Eumenean Society
had as their guest Colonel Scott, head of
the Reserve Officers Training Corps on the
Davidson campus. Colonel Scott made a very
interesting talk on West Point. He did not
relate so much of the life at, the military
academy, but he told of the many stiff re-
quirements for entrance into the government

school,

The Eumenean Society has made many
new plans for the future. It was decided at
the last meeting that a key Mill be presented

to attend the meetings of the society on
each Tuesday evening at 7:15.

The Philanthropic Literary Society intends
to experiment with a plan suggested by Dr.
Currie, an alumnus of the society. This
plan is to choose a synod which is to have
meetings at rggular intervals and decide on
ertain issues brought before the society for

consideration.
The Philanthropic Society Hall is the pos-

sessor of the celebrated Napoleon chandelier.
The society purposes to hold a meeting in
the near future and to have this chandelier
lighted. It is reputed that this is the one un-
der which the great emperor, Napoleon, was
married: It was sent from France by an
alumnus of Davidson College.

The society also wishes to extend a cor-
dial invitation to all those interested in any
literary lines.
