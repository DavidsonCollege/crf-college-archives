The Davidson Sailing Team
opens the saliing season this
Saturday with the first regatta
of the 1971 fall competition be-
ing held at the University of
South Carolina.

Senior letterman Allen Lundy
was very optimistic in stating
the team’s chances.

““We’re very strong, coming
off of a good spring showing
when we won one regatta and
finished second in two, and we
definitely should be in conten-
tion for this year’s champion-
ship,” Lundy commented.

We have all of last year’s
team back, plus some freshmen
and a team member returning
from a year abroad, while the
other teams have lost key per-
sonel through graduation,” he
added.

Freshmen Harriers
Disappoint Martin

There were only a couple of

flies in cross-country coach
Sterling Martin's soup last
week-end,

Martin’s charges traveled to
Atlanta Saturday, where they
competed in the Stone Moun-
tain Road Race.

Ovrall, they ran well
against outstanding competi-
tion,” said Martin, “‘but a cou-
ple of things were disappoint-
ing to me.”

The first thing was that fresh-
man Ricky Bell, whom Martin
has been expecting to lead the
team’ this year, ran a_ rather
poor race, covering the five
mile course in 31:31.

“Ricky had some problems
with his legs tying up on him,”
said Martin.

The second was that although
the team’s times were good.
they weren’t quite good enough.

“We had several men under
thirty minutes, but I had hoped
more would finish under twenty-
nine minutes,” said Martin.

As it turned out, only team
captain Howard Boyd broke
twenty-nine minutes. His time
Was 28:26.

The remainder of the Wildcat
top five, however, all got in
under the half-hour mark.

Joe Shibley ran second for
Davidson with a 29:03 perform-
ance.

Freshman Rick Mullen ran
what Martin called a ‘“‘very
fine time” of 29:12. He was fol-
lowed by Ron Clark, who had
a personal best of 29:15, and
George Edwards, clocked in
29:33.

The harriers’ next meet will
be with Western Carolina on
Monday, Oct. 4, and not even
a team nucleus will be much
help to the ‘Cats.

‘‘We’ll be lucky to break up
iheir first seven runners,’ said
Martni. ‘‘Last year, the West-
ern team put eleven men in
front of our first man.”

The Western squad finished
second at Stone Mountain, and
one of their runners was second
in the individual competition.

of the South Atlantic Intercol-
legiate Sailing Association along
with twelve other colleges and
universities in the area

Meets are held at the differ-
ent schools making up this con-
ference during the two parts of
the sailing season, fall and
spring.

“The important meet is the
last one of the season. The
cthers are really just for ex-
perience and to see what the
other schools have.

“There are awards given in
these meets, but the big one is
the final meet which determines
the champion of the conference.
It should be between The Cita-
del, Clemson, University of Ten-

nessee and Davidson,”’ Lundy
said.

The Davidson Sailing Team is
approximately fifteen strong,
taken from the thirty man Sail-
ing Club.

Two boats are raced in each
regatta, one in the “A” divi-
sion, and the other in the ‘‘B”
division, from each school.

Presently Jimmy Hunter, a
junior, is skipper of one boat
and Lundy, a senior, is skipper
of the other.

“Crew members and skippers
vary from race to race accord-
ing to practice, and different
factors such as where the race
is held and under what condi-
tions,” Lundy said.

Saturday, the crew members
will be Tom King, a freshman,
and Frank Sommerville, a soph-
omore. Other skippers are
Daryl Douglas, a sophomore;
Dan Johnston, a senior, and
John Mack, a_ senior. Hunter
and Johnston both have var-
sity letters.

Noi only is this year’s team
a good one but the members
are also very colorful. Dan
Johnston, who was one of the
best skippers before his year
abroad in France, is working
back into his position. He has
been accused of breaking most
of the rules of good - sailing.

Jimmy Hunter has the habit
of burning incense in his boat

to better judge the wind cur-
rents. He’s also been known to
chew tobacco as he sails and
when passing an opponent he
makes use of the other boat as
a spittoon.

So it appears that Davidson
has the makings of quite a
team, according to Lundy, and
the big test of the season should
be the Davidson meet.

“With Davidson being located
centrally in relationship to the
other schools, all of them should
be here for that meet. Lake
Norman can be a pretty rough
place to sail. If we can beat
the other teams here, especial-
ly The Citadel, then I think we
can beat them anywhere.”
