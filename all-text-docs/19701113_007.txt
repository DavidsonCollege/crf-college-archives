John Ribet bursts through Lafayette line.

Leopards Triumph, 53-34

By JOE EARLE
Asst. Sports Editor
“Lafayette had one of the

best planned and best ex-

ecuted passing offenses I've
ever seen,’’ said Defensive
Coach Evans Brown.

“There is no way to stop
a perfect pass game, not
even the pros can do that,”
he said. :

The lafayette Leopards
beat Davidson 53-34 last
week at Richardson Field.

Passing seemed to be the
most important factor in the
game with both teams put;
ting most of their offensive
attack into the air.

Coach Will Campagna
complimented the ‘Cat of-
fense for their show of pow-
er.

Both offenses rolled up
great amounts of yardage,
with the Leopards gaining
544 yards, 350 yards in the
air, and the Wildeats taking
485 total yards, 321 in the
air.

“We played a fine game,
Campagna said, “‘but a few
mistakes hurt us badly.”

Campagna pointed to two
fumbles in ithe first half and
a pass interception that he
felt could have changed the
course of the game.

Delts Claim Title

By HOWARD BOYD
Sports Writer

The Delts scored the first
time it handled the ball and
went on to overwhelm the
SAE’'s 46-18 Monday for the
Championship of the IMAC
flickerball tournament.

The teams had entered
the game tied for first place
in the overall standings
with ‘11-1 records, so the
Delts’ victory also gave
them the league champion-
ship.

After halting an SAE
drive deep in their own ter-
ritory ‘the Delts ‘tallied on
their first offensive play,
‘with Jack Steele on the
scoring end of a long flick-
er play.

The E's came right back
to pull within 746, as Bob
Meadows nailed Roy Camp-

bell with -a ‘touchdown
strike.

After an exchange of
punts, the Delts marched

for another score, with Mike

Ernst taking it over to
make the halftime score
146.

The Delts quickly ‘broke it
open in the second half,
striking for two fast scores
to widen the gap to 27-4.

‘After Meadows and Camp- -

bell teamed for another
touchdown to ceut-the mar-

gin to 27-12, ‘Bob Lewis scor
ed for the Delts on a flicker
and tailback -Bick Halligan
hit Hamp Whittington for
another TD, to put it out
of reach at 40412.

Halligan, Whittington and
center ‘Mark Pandiek—were
particularly outstanding for
the winners, while Meadows,
Campbell and David Wea
ver paced \the losers’ cause.

In the first quarter, tied
7-7, ‘the Wildeats lost the
ball on their own 19, and La
fayette moved ahead 13-7.

Later, leading 21-19, the
Wildcats lost a fumble while
in scaring position on the 26
yard dine,

Both quarterbacks passed
well with ‘Mark Thompson
hitting 25 for 45 with 4 in-
terceptions.

Rich (McKay for Lafayette
hit 24 of 44 with no intercep-
tions.

Davidson set a new school
record for first downs, mak-
ing 33. Lafayette rolled up
31 first downs.

‘Brown Said he did not feel

hat Lafayette was excep-

tional jn their ground at
tack. He felt that they could
not compare with Wofford
or Trinity on the ground,
but they had the best pass-
ing attack the "Cats have
seen.

The last three minutes of
the game were the most ac-
tive for Lafayette. They
scored twice on intercep-
tion and stopped a David
son drive just before time
ran out with an interception.

‘Remember the powerful
‘(M and \M"’ boys who led
the New York Yankees to
several baseball pennants?

Roger (Maris and Mickey
Mantle teamed ‘as one of the
most productive home run
combinations in baseball
history.

Tomorrow will be on dis-
play, another pair of ‘'M
and 'M"’ boys, This time how-
ever, they will be on oppos-
ing’ teams as the Wildcats

Wildcat Head Coach ‘Dave

‘Mary as a.physically tough
and . aggressive team. He
noted, ‘‘Mosser and Bush

we must stop their rushing
attack to win. I know they
