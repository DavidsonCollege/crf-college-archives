Basketball block seating at Coliseum still inconvenient

By SCOTT EBLIN
Staff Correspondent
Davidson students will not be
able to secure block seating for
basketball games at the Char-
lotte Coliseum, according to a
memo issued by Athletic Direc-
tor Thomas Cartmill.

* Under this year’s ticket pol-.

icy a student may pick up one
complimentary ticket at the
athletic ticket office by presen-
ting his ID. Also, a student can
pick up his ticket at the
Coliseum on the night of the
game if he bas not done so in
advance.

Students will not be able to
pick up other students’ tickets,
even if they have the others’

ID's. Cartmill gave two reasons
for not allowing students to
pick up tickets for a group.
First, the accounting system.
used by Coliseum management
makes block seating inconven-
ient. Second, Cartmill said a
fraternity or eating house’s
taking a block of the best seats
is “discriminatory to the indi-
vidual or independent who is
left out in left field in the less
desirable seats."

- SGA President John Jackson
said he agreed with Cartmill but
added, “Hopefully, a fair and
reasonable procedure for reser-.
ving group tickets can be
worked out between the Ath-

Beaufort students returning

letic Office and the SGA.”:

The basketball team will play
aen games at the Coliseum this
season. Complimentary tickets
will be available for students for
all these games except the First
Union Invitational Tourna-
ment, to be played December 7
and 8, and the Davidson-UNCC
game, to be played in February.

The Charlotte Jaycees are spon-
soring the fournament and are
selling tickets to Davidson stu-
dents at a discount rate of two
dollars. Cartmill anticipates
that both tournament and the
UNCC game might sell out and
encourages students to get their
tickets early.

Housing situation remains ‘tremendously tight’

By NANCY WARREN

Although Director of Hou-
sing Bill Bolding expects every-
one to have a room winter term,
the housing situation is “‘tre-
mendonsly tight.”

Bolding says that placing the
25 students returning from the
fall term Beaufort Program will
not be a problem since 21 of the
25 reserved rooms last year.

However, the students who
temporarily reside in thirteen of
these rooms must relocate win-
ter term. These displaced stu-
dents can either go off campus
or fill some of the 28 spaces left
by students departing for the

stay on campus must then move
again spring term.

The present housing problem,
according to Bolding, results
not from the size of the fresh-
man class but from the the
anusually large number of up-
perclassmen choosing to stay on
campus. Only 96 seniors went.
off campus this year compered
to the 175 the Housing Office
“banks on” every year. As a
result, 52 juniors and 28 sopho-
mores ‘‘were forced off cam-

”

pus.”

apartments.

The major stumbling block
with the Radolph plan is finan-
cing, accoraing to’ Terry. The
failure of the College to receive
HUD building loans in 1972 and
1979 forced the College to raise

‘money for dorms from the
private sector. The Trustees
had i disapproved of
this method of raising funds for
dorms. Their policy was that a
dormitory must pay for itself
through student fees, Terry

Teery said that the choice of
Little had been “expedient” and
due to his experience with the
Radolph plans he feels that “se
committee cannot design a buil.
ding.”’ Meetze said that Little is
&@ fine architecture firm and that
the campun’ classically-oriented
architecture may be unexciting
bat it is “well matched.”

/Bolding sees this back-to-
campus ‘movement as part of a
national trend, which, with
Davidson's declining attrition.
rate, increases the competition
for dorm space.

If the student population
does not increase, two new
dorms, scheduled for comple-
tion in September 1981 and
providing 112-114 additional
spaces, will alleviate the present
housing problems, Bolding
said.

Until then, Bolding hopes to
revamp the present lottery sys-
tem, which puts sophomores at

a disadvantage. He will meet
soon with the Council on Cam-
pus and Relious Life to discuss
alternative systems.

Bolding will propose an open
lottery or a lottery. excluding
seniors who will then choose
from the remaining rooms. He
wants to protect the interests of
the sophomores who “especially
need the community and secu-
tity’ found.in a dorm situation.

Bolding said he plans to
“advertise heavily” for off cam-
pus living. This will ensure that
the lounges in Cannon, Sentelle,
Little, and Watts are empty by
next year, Bolding said.

——Evaluation———_

(eontinued from page 1)
The ICES form has two
parts. First, students respond.
to three ‘‘global’' questions

-asked about the professor and

the course. Second, they answer
23 questions selected by the
professor being evaluated. The
professor selects his questions
from a master list of 623
questions, and the results
reaction to specific areas of his
course. ;
Kello said that the size of the
master list allows professors to
find questions that are suitable
for analyzing particular styles
and courses. McKelway, how-
ever, feels that many of the
questions are’ restatements of

and challenging ones. Kello
added that he would be “truly
surprised”” if students did not
respond objectively in the ICES
forms.

McKelway said use of the
ICES forms might have nega-
tive effects on the faculty. Since
both students adn faculty will
consider the ICES results as an
‘important aspect’’ of evalu-
ation, professors — especially
those concerned about raises,
promotions, and tenure—will
attempt to maximize their
ratings. ‘It is well for faculty to
want to please students, but if
pleasing students becomes more
important than it should in
(professors’) professional judg-

others and added that any such ments,...then the quality of
questionnaires are “‘limited” in education will have to suffer,”
what they can help professors McKelway said.
discover, _Kello emphasized that the
’ McKalway criticized the’glo- _ purpose of the ICES forms is to
bal questions as “caricatmzes”” alle allow professors to modify
of the forms’ ‘‘meaningless’’ course conient in response to
approach to evaluation. (The critical evaluation. He doubied
three global questions are: rate that professors would pender to

the course content; rate the
instruction; and rate the course
in general.) McKelway said
student responses might often
reflect how pleased students
were about certain courses
rather than what they learned.
“Good teaching and levels of
student pleasure are supposed
to be ineluctably joined — but
thet ain’t true,”’ MeKelway
said. Kello said that he felt
Davidson students were *‘so-
phisticated” and “responsible”
enough to state the difference
between easy. enjoyable courses

students to get high ICES
ratings. “Phere is a difference
between viable response (to
student criticism) and pan-
dering to students,” Kello said.

In a September interview,
PAC Chairman Anthony Ab-
bott noted that “Generally the
reaction lof the faculty to the
forms) was positive,” though he
conceded that ‘‘some people
just don’t like forms.’ The
forms “have not been adopted
permanently ,”” Abbott snid, but
will be reevaluated by the PAC
after six terms of use.

—— Self-Selection——

freshman who hasn't shown any
interest at all in.a house or
fraternity will be higher on the
waiting list than someone who
has shown a lot of interest
simply by the luck of the draw.
The new rules may allow the
house to let the interested
freshmen in by challenging the
uninterested freshman’s selec-
tion.”

Eglin added that the chal-
lenge must be based on how
much interest the freshman has
shown, not on the house mem-
bers’ personal opinions of the
person.

The guidelines are based on |

suggestions made by fraterni-
ties and eating houses. “It is
amazing how ‘much the propo-
sals from eating houses differed
from those of fraternities,’

‘Eglin said. ‘Everything we

decided was a compromise.” -
Committee member Jeff Har-
ris said he opposed having two
sets of rules, stressing that they
are merely approximations.
**My main concern is that future

freshman advisors will take
these approximations literally,
but I think there are enough

‘safeguards to prevent this,”

Harris

Committee member Al Rhyne.
countered by noting the desires
of the fraternities. ‘They felt
like freshmen ought to meet
officers to discyss the concept of
national fraternities so that the
unity within a fraternity will
not be diminished,’’ he said.
They wanted interested fresh-
men to attend more social
functions because “fraternities
are more socially oriented’’ than
eating houses, Rhyne said.

' Any violation of these proce-
dures should be reported to the
Dean of Students or a member
of the Self-Selection Regulatory
Committee. Despite the efforts
of the committee, council mem-
ber Jim Robertson predicted
that at least one hundred fresh-
men will be denied membership
in Patterson Court houses be-
cause of limited openings and
the unusually large freshman
class.
