... On Second Thought

All of the excitement and contro-
versy which was anticipated prior to
this week’s trustee meeting failed to
materialize, but in the end, most peo-
ple seemed surprisingly satisfied—
rather unusual for trustee meetings.

But within the wording of the trus-
tee recommendations there lie some
potential problems, which it might. be
wise to examine while the issues are
still alive.

I

Wildcat football could hardly have
picked a better year in which to excel,
and, that excellence was rewarded by
the trustee decision to maintain a sub-
sidized football program.

yin itself that decision is well found-
ed, but within the stipulation concern-
ing funding of that program there lies
a‘serious threat.

By separating the football fund
from the living endowment of the col
lege arid handing over a large part of
the responsibility for that drive to an
extra-campus organization, the college
is placing its control over athletics in
jeopardy.

In a similar manner the college is
placing the football program in jeop-
ard

y.

In the first place there is a possi-
bility. that the Wildcat Club, by virtue
of its control over the fund drive for
football, might become even more vo-
cal than in the past over the direction
of the athletic program.

There is nothing wrong with strong
support, but the college must beware
of the loss of control of the football
program to a group of ‘results-for-
our-money’’ lobbyists.

In this respect, too, Wildcat foot-
ball is placed in a most precarious
position, to say the least.

Trustee chairman Lingle pointed
out that more than the recommend-
ed number of scholarships could be
given if such an amount of money
making that possible were raised.

What was not said was that there
is also the distinct possibility that the
new system could leave Davidson foot-
ball withering on the vine.

A couple of poor seasons could
make that possibility much more real,
and poor seasons do make their ap-
pearances occasionally at Davidson.

The question must be asked: if we
examine the new plan realistically,
will it really benefit the college that
much? Or will it not provide more of
a threat than a promise?

II

The recommendation that the col-
lege intensify its effort to enroll stu-
dents from a variety of racial, eco-
nomic, social and geographica] back-
grounds is well presented.

We call now for an early response
on the part of the administration in
order to meet the needs of the ad
missions department; progress can be
made in this area immediately.

The idea of abolishing any type of
a quota system for such enrollment is
also well-spoken, if it is meant that

‘est possible date. Though i

we should not limit the number of
such enrollments. i

If, however, this statement is meant
to relieve the pressure of finding more
qualified black students, then it should
be reconsidered. In this respect the
quota system played the beneficial
role of initiating considerable positive
action in this area.

What should be imperative from
the resolution as passed is the neces-
sity of prompt and definite action in
the recruiting of all qualified students

of all origins.

Il
The ‘willingness to consider’ co-
education had to be somewhat disap-
pointing. It is almost like a “willing-

ness to consider’ saving money. ied

Both are necessities, which can’t be
cast off indifferently. But the trustees
have cast the former off with such a,
treatment. i

Because they considered the pro-
posal of the Spencer Commission “‘be-
yond economic practicality,” they
merely subscribed to the theory and
let it go. ;

There was no mention of who was
to find a plan that was within eco-
nomic practicality; there was only an
endorsement of the idea. That is not
enough. :

The college must labor quickly now
to find such a plan, so that coeduca-
tion can be implemented -at*the earli-
fiot
good to rush into 'the issue blindfold-

ed,‘ neither is it practical to put it off -~

repeatedly. .

The trustees must come to grips
with the problem, either by, appoint-
ing a study committee to draw up a
workable plan or by delegating that
responsibility. It can not be cast aside.

IV

There is still a question regarding
the future development of the college:
when does it begin?

The long range projections indicate
changes over the next 15 to 20 years
as the endowment becomes sufficient
to handle the northward expansion ac-
cepted by the Trustees.

But there is a question as to when
it will begin; what part of the plan
will be implemented in the early
stages?...

Fortunately the new library will be
begun almost as soon as plans are fin-
ished, and the architect has been con-
tacted.

But the other plans incorporated in
the Dober, Paddock and Upton report
are hazy prognostications rather than
potential realities.

Whether we realize these vague
recomm€ndations depends largely on
the ability of the administration to in-
crease the living endowment of the
college significantly.

It is, therefore, imperative that the
college begin soon, even today, to dis-
cover and gather the financial re-
sources which alumni, foundations and
endowments have to offer.

We must get started.

The Power And The Press

—Phis-week;-which-marks the -initia-
tion of a new editorial year, also an-
ticipates the beginning of a new SGA
government in a situation that has
impligalions both forthe SGA and
THE DAVIDSONIAN.

We are referring to the apparent
ai‘itude which Mr. Coble holds toward
the administration of his predecessor,
Peter Hobbie.

During the remarkably similar cam-
paigns of the three presidential can-
didates last month, one point in par-
ticular stood out as a point of agree-
ment among the candidates. And that
point was the opinion of all three that
Hobbie had seriously overstepped the
limitations of his office with regard
to issues of national concern.

All three claimed that Hobbie-had
misdirected his energies by turning
himself away from the problems of
students, in his concern about extra-
campus issues, specifically the Viet
nam Moratorium. Perhaps most seri-
ously they charged that Hobbie had
misappropriated student funds in pur-
suing his interests in other areas.

* Now if such funds were ,used with-
out the consent of the SGA Senate or
whatever legal approfriations should
been used, then.Coble and his asso
ciates have made a very valid point.
But the appropriations of funds is not
a question which we wish to debate
here.

What does coricern us is the appar-
ently widely held attitude that the
SGA should limit itself and the school
to matters endemic to’this one cam-

us.
F We are bothered by the opinion that
we should turn ourselves inward to

our Own concerns and form commit-
tees or debate in assembly or do what-
ever else satisfies our desire to occu-
py our time by the busy. but never-
theless petty exercise of our power.

Now?nat is not to say that Coble
cannot do a great deal for this campus
or that there is not a great deal to be
done. s

We are merely suggesting that a
campus as isolated as Davidson’s and
with a student body as homogeneous
as Davidson’s may well benefit from
occasional prodding to keep up with
the mainstream of national intellec-
tual concern.

What we are saying to Coble is this:
do the work on campus. Keep things
running and improve them
you have promised in your platform.
But do not react wrongly to Hobbie
by ignoring issues whichygo beyond
the Davidson campus. :

Campuses have always been sources
of humanitarian and liberal concern,
and now is no time for that to change.

There should be a ‘willingness to
confront larger issues. Is not that wil!
ingness what extracampus responsi-

- bility is all about?

And where does that leave THE
DAVIDSONIAN? It leaves us trying
to adopi the same concern we urge
on Mr. Coble. We too wish to be an
active force for improving the cam-
pus. And we will speak out when we
feel it is necessary for us to do so.

But we will try not to speak out of
isolation but out of a sense of the role
that the SGA and THE DAVIDSON-
IAN can play to help make Davidson
real to its students. : !

To the Editor:

The spontaneous cheer
during the East Carolina

evaluation.

I am sure that many who
participated in the cheer
felt they were merely giv

ing voice to what others
were thinking, including
myself.

havior and fully intend to
set a better example for our
fans,

We have played in some
tough places this year, but
what happened at Wake For-
est, where the team and the
playing floor were shower-
ed by ice, «cups and seat
bolts, was by far the worst.

The point is that such be-
havior is expected at Wake

ing here. We should strive
to keep it this way and im
preve our fan behavior.

As I was leaving a show
ing of ‘‘Martyrs of Love,”

From The Same People Who Brought
Area Exams - The:Honors College!

I overheard a confused and
disappointed student mutter-
ing something about ‘‘sym-
bolism.’

Then in THE DAVIDSON-
IAN I encountered Don
Hoyt's  castigation of the
film as “‘Unadulterated
Czechoslovakian ‘erdue.’’*;

I believe that these reac-
tions deserve response. Be-
cause I appreciated ‘‘Mar-
tyrs of Love,’ these people
will assume either that I
have some special know-
ledge (‘‘symbolism"’) which
they lack, that I have pecu
lier tastes, ur that I am “‘in
fear of being considered
gauche, old-fashioned, and
square’ (Hoyt's words).

To the student who mut-
tered ‘“‘symobilsm,’’ I would
admit that I did not logical-
ly comprehend everything,
although I did preceive an
order.

I would also remark, how
ever, that I have seen a
fair number of films not us-
ually shown at’ the — local
movie house.

Don Hoyt’'s reaction is the
one I do not understand, be-
cause I do not believe he
suffers from inadequate ex-
perience.

‘He seemed to believe that
he could praise an American
film (‘The Reivers'’ by dis-
paraging a foreign one.

His consideration of ‘‘Mar-
tyrs of Love’’ could scarce-
ly be called critical, Ex-
cluding such fulminations as

“trash as art’ and ‘‘damn
fool,"’ he really does not say
anything about the film.

He ends by saying that
the film is ‘‘excruiatingly
bad,"’ and then asks, “What
more can be said?”

His amassing epithets
ad “closing with “a rhetori-
cal question suggests that
no real attempt was made
to understand or appreciate
the film.

Although he says that he
tried to enter into the spirit
of -the film, he certainly
gives little evidence of hav-
ing done so.

In discussing ‘‘The Reiv
ers,’ Hoyt sees fit to char-
acterize the horse race se-
quence as ‘‘the most stun-
ning . . . in film history.”

Anyone who can pronounce
on all of film history certain-
ly must have a broad ac-
quaintance, and it would

“seem that he would be cap

able of writing a more analy-
tical review.

There is a Connection be-

Richard H, Blum in ‘‘Stu-

Jossey-Bass Inc., San Fran-

Among the family heritag-

scene because of social pres

puses where the majority has
used marijuana.

Thus the non-user becomes
the unusual case:

“Over the callege years, the
abstainers at least become

Dr. Btum writes.

Marijuana thus becomes
an “approved” drug by stu-
dent standards “and an uh-

portion of some faculties as
well, so that one must ex-
pect that even the upright

1 ROLASALINGEN SARA E Aa RE

. t Pt .
Biafra’s Misery
The war in Biafra is over at last. ‘ :
All wars are tragic, but in that regard this one was

aN

‘rather special. There was the tragedy of the Biafran

starvation. 3

It was tragic that the most promising of Africa’s
nations had to be torn this way, and it was tragic that
that nation’s most energetic people had to waste their
talents in an inevitably forlorn struggle.

There was tragedy in the rioting that started the
war, and there was worse tragedy in the Rhos’ belief
that the other Nigerians were out to massacre them,
for that belief is unlikely to die soon.

But none of these matched up to what was iron-
ically the worst tragedy of them all: the Western effort
to relieve Biafra’s starvation.

Why was that the tragedy? Not only because the
effort never succeeded, not even because it was doom-
ed from the start.

The real tragedy of the relief effort was that with
the best intentions, with hard work, with the accept-
ance of danger and of sacrifice, it accomplished in the
end precisely the opposite of what it set out to do.

e relief effort gave the Biafrans hope and just
a trickle of supplies, enough to prolong the war. But
the relief could never give Biafra enough food to fight
on, and food is far more basic to an army than weap-
onry. As a result the war went on deadlocked, and
more and more Biafrans began to take on the appear
ance of the babies one saw on the demonstrators’ pos
ters, with their huge heads and eyes and bellies: and
their pencil-thin limbs, skin stretched so taught. it
seemed even a nurse’s gentle touch would bruise it.

There was never even any chance that Biafra could
be meaningfully supplied by airlift. There were too
many people in an area too disorganized. Even inside
the final lines there’ were far more people than there
were in Berlin during the largest successful airlift
ever tried.

That airlift was carried out by the U.S. armed
forces, who for all their failings are very good at that
sort of thing. The money and prestige of the United
States stood behind it; behind this airlift were some
churches and various international organizations.

It succeeded beyond any reasonable expectations,
but even such success meant only that the Biafrans
would keep fighting and starving. hoping the West
would force the Nigerian leader Yakubu Gowon to
give up the fight.

Gowan has been blamed for both the failure of fhe
airlift and for the starvation, but such blame-is not

. really fair. Gowon was in a similar position to Grant's

at Vicksburg, where the people ate-rats and eventually
their belts before. surrendering. Grant did not want
the people to starve, but had the British come sailing
up the Mississippi and demanded permission to feed
the Vicksburg citizens, Grant would hardly have given
it as long as he had the power to resist.

Gowan did not have much power to resist, but to
perform his duty as leader of his equntry he had to
keep the aid from being effective.

So the Biafrans kept getting a trickle that kept
them trying and hoping, but all that could be accom-
plished was that more Biafrans starved.

Odumegwu Ojukwu, the Biafran leader, is not
really to blame either. He did what he saw to be nec-
essary for the survival of his people, and there was
nothing wrong With his courage or his struggle, only
perhaps with his vision.

It was not a pointless struggle, either. Historically
the inland tribes of Nigeria. have been economically
dependent on access to the sea through the so-called
“Oil Rivers”, which are really the delta mouths of the
Niger and which were in Biafran territory. Gowon
knew that Nigeria had to have Biafra to exist.

The power relationships had to work themselves
out and decide whether Nigeria would continue to ex-
ist. The relief effort could only prolong the working
out of those relationships without really ameliorating
the effects of the struggle.

Does that mean the relief effort should never have
been made?

Answer: that is precisely what it means. That is
not a very pleasant answer, especially when translated
into terms of not helping starving babies, but there it
stands, sharp and clear.

Intervention is acceptable when one has the power
to intervene effectively and is sure that this is in the
interest of those involved. Those who intervened in
Biafra did not have that power, and the intervention
was in nobody’s interest, not even theirs.

That is a lesson that one might apply when one
thinks about some other part of the world, too, be it
Southeast Asia, Greece, the Mideast, or anywhere else.
