“lf You Didn’t Read It In

The Davidson Update, |
It Didn't Happen.”°?!?

lf we students at The Davidsonian believed that, we wouldn't be publishing,
weekly. But we are. These are a few of the things we do differently:

Propaganda is not our
policy. We don’t try to
sell you Davidson ties,
blazers, or rocking chairs--
(Just subscriptions.) Which
is the point of all this.
We want you to. keep
up with Davidson.
04% The Davidsonian
% Néfe’won't update you--
“M\we'll keep you in-
i) formed --weekly.
The best part is,

We follow the Wildcats. (The Update
only lets you know when they win.)
Unfortunately, you’re missing

a lot of news.

We print investigations,
analyses, and opinions of
program and policy.
(The Update assumes
that Davidson is
perfect.) We probe
a little bit deeper
and point out the Hf
problems (so it = f'-

will be perfect =v a subscription to
by the time | The Davidsonain
were alumini.) - costs only $6.00
