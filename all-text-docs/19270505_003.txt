Freshmen Respond to Call for
Two Teams to Debate Carolina

The Freshmen responded voluminously to
a call for debaters to meet the University of
North Carolina. The men of the group of
twenty-two, to make the team, were A: T.
Edelman, J. C. Williams, F. D. Miller and
Murray Christian, with W. J. Beavers, and
C. R. Pritchett, alternates. The subject of
the debates is, Resolved: that the United
States should cancel the Interallied war
debts. The debate will probably be held the
first of next week, the exact time to be an-
nounced later.

|
The affirmative will be up- |
held in Shearer Hall by F. D. Miller, who|
won first place, and by J. C. Williams, who
placed third. At the same time Murray
Christian, second place, and A. T, Edelman, |

fourth place, will make the trip to Chapel
Hill and debate the negative side of the|
question with the affirmative team of Caro- |
lina,

The twenty-two Freshmen to try out were |
Gaffney, Russell, Pritchett, Mathews, Boag,
Harrison, McGuire, Beavers, Williams, |
er, Edelman, Christian,
Pratt, Marsh, Millican,

In this group of men there is much promising |

material for future debaters and none of | |
them are to be discouraged from trying for |
the varsity teams of the coming years. The| 7
popular side of the question with this repre ||
sentative group of men was the negative, only |
five men speaking on the affirmative.

The purpose of the fresh debating teams |
is to prepare prospective varsity debaters for |
the task they will have in the following three |
years of upholding Davidson as a forensic
college. The men who have made the teams
are being assisted in their preparation by
Don Wharton and Harllee Branch, both of
whom are well acquainted with the subject,
having debated it four times this year,

It has been the custom for several years
for the Davidson and Carolina Fresh to
clash. In the past three years 18 votes have
been cast between the two schools and 16 of
these have gone to Davidson. The Freshmen
have, therefore, quite a record to.maintain
Carolina has the two state champion men of
last year and the decision will be closely con-
tested, so it is desired that as many students
as possibly can will come out to the Fresh
debate and support the team with their pres-
ence, *

Murray Christian is fom Mobile, Ala. He
reports no previous experience, but if he
has any of that Christian blood in him-he is
bound to ‘come out on the rightt end. “Alex”
Edelman is from Goldsboro, N. C. Last year

he won over the Columbia High School in |’

debate. J. C. Williams come from Hinden,
N. C. He has debated quite extensively in
high school.
Tenn., has had no previous experience in de=
bating but reports a few victories in the field
of oratory.

Business Staff of |
Chameleon Named

The business staff of the Chameleon was |

Trabue, the busines manager. His selection |
is as follows: H. A. Knox, Jr., and C. H. |
Mauzy, assistant business managers, and M.
T. Gilmour, circulation manager. |

work, Knox and Gilmour having served as |

ing the past year. Besides the work with |
which they are now connected all three are |
interested in’ various campus activities, Gil- |

Wildkittens Lose |
to Tarheel. Fresh

Last Thursday, April 28, the Davidson |
| Fresh were defeated in the ninth inning by |
{the Carolina Fresh by the score of 10 to 7, |
in the second game of their trip.

In the eighth inning the score was 7 to 6|
in favor of Davidson, but in the ninth the |

Tar Babies made a sensational rally, bring- |
ing in a three run lead which the Wildkittens |
were unable to overcome. |

The otherwise fast game was shot through
| with countless errors by both teams, and the
| score zig-zagged back and forth through the |
| first eight innings of the game, neither team |
| being able to gain a substantial lead over the |
other, but in the fatal ninth Carolina made |
four runs, due to errors on the part of the |
visitors and heavy hitting on the part of the |
home team, |

Miller and Kilgore were the outstanding |
players of the Davidson warriors, both lads |
chalking up two hits apiece, while the star of |
the Tar Baby nine was Sinclair, who clouted | |
out three one-base hits. The box score: :

ABR HPOA

MODERN smokers are the most
critical ever known, and Camel is
their favorite. Why?

Camel is the one cigarette that
will stand up all day and as far
into the night as you care to go.

Modern, experienced smokers
know that they can smoke one
or a million Camels with never a
tired taste or a cigaretty after-
taste.

Present-day smokers

demand goodness, and find it in
Camels — the choicest tobaccos
grown and matchless blending.
That is why Camel is favorite in
the modern world.

If you want the choice of the
hardest-to-please smokers of all
time, if you yearn for the mel-
lowest mildness that ever came

from a cigarette—
**Have a Camel!”
