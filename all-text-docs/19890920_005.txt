China’s turmoil forces
Holland to cut visit short

By JESSICA THURBEE

What is it like to live in a
society where you have no
choice of a career? What is it
like to live in a society where
you are not allowed to speak
your mind for fear of punish-
ment? What is it like toliveina
society where nepotism runs
rampant and government cor-
ruption is the norm? Welcome
to China.

Professor of English Gill
Holland and his wife Siri got
the chance to see the effects of
this type of society firsthand
when in mid-February of this
year they left for China to teach
English, literature and writing
to students at the Beijing Nor-

mal University. They returned |

earlier than planned due to the
violence and unrest in the city.

According to Holland, the
most interesting or exciting
experience he had were the
demonstrations, but the visit
as a whole was exciting. In

streets, Holland mentioned
that he was the guest of honor
at a party where a whole turtle
was served. It was brought in
floating, head, legs and tail. As
the guest of honor, Holland got
to gnaw on the shell of the
turtle.

At the beginning of his trip
things were quiet, said Hol-
land, but the unrest began on
April 15 when the students’
hero, Hu Yao Baing, died.
Holland emphasized the fact
that the students and the
people of China were courte-
ous and kind to him.

“The students’ major pre-
cept was nonviolence,” he
said, adding that the students
had no desire to hurt anyone.
Their main goal was the insti-
gation of a public forum to
discuss government corrup-
tion and nepotism, he main-
tained.

The atmosphere was one of
high drama and excitement,
but also of idealism, optimism

Campus Pub replaces Peregrine’s

* By PETER BYNUM
Shawn Merrithew didn’t act
like a man who was two hours
away from the grand opening

of a brand new business. As he.

showed me around his new
investment last Thursday-—-
The Campus Pub--I quickly
began to get a feel for the at-
mosphere that he was trying to
create.

It was not a forced feeling,
but a natural, relaxed confi-
dence that reflected the atti-
tude of the owner. It came
from the pictures of Davidson
athletes that graced the walls.
It sprang from the jerseys of
each house on Patterson Court
that hung beside a photograph
of its membership. It was feltin
the spirit of the Davidson stu-

dents helping with final prepa-
rations. Shawn Merrithew had
no reason to be nervous. “The
Campus Pub” will have no
problem fitting into the
Davidson lifestyle. °

The type of atmosphere that
I felt is exactly the image that
Merrithew seeks for his pub.
He plans to gear the establish-
ment toward the needs and
desires of the college commu-
nity and is willing to con-
stantly keep an ear to the
ground to stay in touch with
the students.

“I'll change my specials ev-
ery night if my customers want
me to,” said Merrithew. “We'll
remain really flexible in every-
thing we do.”

And there seems to be a lot

College bowl’s back

Last year the College Bowl
team finished a_ surprising
third in the regional tourna-
ment. This exemplifies the re-
surgence of Davidson in col-
lege bowl competition. The
current team wants to emu-
latethe success of the 1979 na-
tional champion team. ——_

The college bowl competes
in several tournaments
throughout the year, including
regionals, the first step to the
national championship. Our
region is the largest and.tough-
est in the country, but the team
regularly beats schools that
defeat us in other sports.

lina and Memphis State all cas

Doug Gibson, Joe Louder-

Grainger start on the team, and
Arjun Srinivasan is an alter-

ber from last year’s group,
John Hutchinson, to gradu-
ation.

The intensity of the team has
already manifested: itself at
practice this year. The Univer-
sity of Virginia eventually won
regionals last year, an upset-
ting fact to some team mem-
bers. Louderback said, “My

‘that Merrithew plans to do.

Professional football will natu-
rally play a big partin the life of
the bar, with free food offered
on Sunday afternoons and
pitcher specials on Monday
nights. But The Campus Pub is
for students, and naturally
Davidson athletics will receive
a great deal of emphasis.

Merrithew has already es-
tablished a close relationship
with our varsity football team,
offering to provide a free din-
ner each week and to present
Player of the Week awards.
Action photos of athletes from
all sports will hang on the
walls of the pub

A sports theme will not
dominate the bar, for Mer-
rithew’s goal is to appeal to the
entire student body. A small
stage with an open micro-
phone sits in one corner, a
perfect setting for guitar musi-
cians or solo performers. Occa-
sionally, Merrithew may invite
a Charlotte band or let a stu-
dent group take the stage. He
seems quite open to students’
suggestions and the possibili-
ties for entertainment at The
Campus Pub remain very flex-
ible.

The idea for the pub sprang
from a need that Merrithew
sensed himself. As a divorced
single living in Davidson, he
was painfully aware of the lack
of social opportunities in
town. He thoughta casual pub
near campus would liven

_things up considerably.

. peed ee began

When the owner of Pere-
grine House, Bob Johnson, put
his restaurant on the market

CP VE Se re es

fo consider turning the place
into a pub. The college looked
into the property for office

space as did at least one other ,

individual investor. Both of
these deals fell through, clear-
ing the way for Merrithew’s
offer. Johnson accepted and he
remains a silent partner in the
enterprise.

“I was waiting for someone
else to do it,” claimed Mer-
rithew, “but nobody did. So I
did it myself.”

As with any new business,
The Campus Pub is forcing
some tough decisions on its
owner. Merrithew is currently
employed as a manager for the
college’s catering service. Car-
leton Pritchard, Director of
Auxiliary Services, has voiced
some concern that Merrithew
may find himself in a conflict
of interest due to his new in-
vestment. Merrithew con-
tends that this won’tbea prob-
lem, but also feels a duty to
choose whether to continue
work with the college or to
devote his time to The Campus
Pub. He expects to make a
decision soon after opening
night. Judging on the ‘first
night of business, he will do
what he thinks “feels right. te

There is little doubt in my
mind that the Davidson com-
munity will soon know that
The Campus Pub “feels right.”

AsI walked out the door that
Thursday afternoon I was
struck with the thought that
Merrithew’s place was more
than a new business on Depot
Street. The Campus Pub could

and most of all patriotism, he
said. The students were not
trying to overthrow the gov-
ernment, but to make it more
responsible. Students’ original
plan, he said, was to stay in the
square until the Communist
Party meeting June 20th.

The most shocking event
was the arrival of the People’s
Army, said Holland. This was
the “people’s” army, and he
said that the Chinese felt that
the army would never hurt
them. Unfortunately, the ma-
jority of the Chinese were
wrong.

Whenasked if he anticipated
such a violent outcome Hol-
land replied, “No, but there
was fear in the air.” He wenton
to say that.he fervently dis-
agrees with people who say
that the students could have
preventedthe events. He feels
that these critics are “wrong-
headed” and mistaken.

The students’ demands
were far from extravagant,
said Holland. They wanted a
public discussion of govern-
ment corruption anda reversal
of an editorial in the April 26th
issue of The People’s Daily (Bei-
jing’s daily newspaper) which
had accused the students of
unpatriotic behavior. Most of
all, however, the students did
not wanta cover-up, he added.
They realized that they were
takinga bigriskand would be
forced to pay a price. Unfortu-
nately, they had no idea the
price would be so high.

Secondly, Holland feels that
the governmentis to blame. He
feels that their ineptitude and
callousness caused _ the
people's dissatisfaction. Had -
the government been willing
to listen to the students’ de-
mands seriously, the outcome
would not have been so vio-
lent, he said.

Another problem in the gov-
ernment was the fact that it
was not speaking with one
voice. There were-several fac-
tions in the government, each
vying for power. Now, how-
ever, as Holland put it, “The
government speaks with one
big lying voice.”

When asked if he thought
that anything would come of
the demonstrations, Holland
replied, “We all hoped that
they would succeed.” He felt
that the possibility was there,
because before they arrived
“terrific” events had already

- occurred. Criticisms of the

government were written,
signed and published in news-
papers. The outlook was
promising for change, but it
appears as if the government
was not prepared to go very
far, added Holland. _
Holland said that everyone
