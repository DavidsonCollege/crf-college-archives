Union Head Discusses
Artist Series Problems

By TOM COLVIN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

This week the DAVIDSONIAN visited the office of Mr. C. Shaw Smith director
of student activities. Mr. Smith, after punching his hidden “servant's button” and
dispatching a stack of dictaphone reels to a secretary, wheeled around in his chair,
leaned back comfortably, and spoke. “Yeah, I'll be happy to tell you about the
Artist Series.”

The Artist Series is directed
by a committee appointed by
the President. The committee
is presently composed of Prof.
Plott, chairman, C. Shaw Smith,
secretary, Professors Griffin,
Patterson, West, and Marrotte.

“Many people think Mr. Plott
and I run the series ourselves,
but we don't,” the committee
eceretary remarked. He ex-
plaised folly the functioning of
the committee, pointing out

spirituals, no blues (to religious
Southern people, blues were
“sinful”). Of course, Josh
agreed, but in New York, alter

spirituals. So he recorded blues
under a pseudonym, Pine Wood
Tom.

President Franklin D. Roose-
velt heard Josh's record album,
“Southern Exposure” and be-
came curious about Josb and
invited him to the White House
to sing the songs from the al-
bum for him and Mrs. Roose

ernoon the inspection team ob-
served the Cadet Brigade pass
in review.

ion. Here a number of parents
who had come to see the parade
gathered informally with the
cadre of the Davidson College
ROTC Department. Officials of

and advanced cadets were also
present.
