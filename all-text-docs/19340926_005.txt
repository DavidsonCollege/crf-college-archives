Intimation Of The Executive
Committee Made Necessary
The Discussion

IN PROBATION PERIOD

A meeting of the student body was
called Wednesday, September 19th, by
President “Skip” Brown to formulate a
definite ‘policy in regard to the radio sit-
uation,

For the greater part of last year ra-
dios were not allowed on Davidson cam-
pus util during the latter part of the
yeas when, by a faculty ruling, the radio
situation was placed in the hands of the
Student Government.

A plan submitted by officers of the
Student Administration was approved by
the student body. This plan has nothing
to do with the honor system, but gives
permission to students to own and op-
erate radios using their own discretion
concerning the probability of disturbing
their neighbors,

Provision was made in the plan  stat-
ing that if three complaints were made
against the owner the instrument would
he removed from the occupant’s room.

Due to an Executive Committee inti-
mation that rigid control was not being
exercised and that an administration in-
junction against the ownership and use
of radios would be forth-coming unless
action was taken, President Brown made
an-earnest plea to Davidson students to
aid by coéperative means to control and
enjoy the use of radios.

Article 5, Section 9 in the Constitution
under which the radio situation shall be
governed, reads as follows:

“There shall be no playing of musical
instruments or unnecessary noise of 7:30
P. M. and 7:30 A. M., except on Satur-
day and Sunday nights.”

This article is no part of the honor
system, and is not subject to action by
the Student Council, but placed in
what might be “Davidson's Bill
of Rights” to protect the interest of those
who might be distracted or in any Way
disturbed by

Summer Religious Work

Dr.
the

P. H. Gwynn, Jr, professor in
Department of Education and So-
ciology at Davidson College, spent the
earlier part of this summer in the meet-
ing of the Committee on Purpose of the
National Council on Religion ‘in Higher
Education, held in New York City.

Dr. Gwynn was chosen to represent
the southern section of the United States
in the work of this committee. Later
in the summer, Dr. Gwynn spent three
weeks in the state of Arkansas lecturing
in synodical conferences of the Southern
Presbyterian Church. During one week
in August he continued his educational
work by directing a Patients’ Institute
for Camp Sequoyah near Asheville,
Ni G;

During the early part of September,
he attended the Week-of-Work of the
National Council on Religion in Higher
Kducation at Rochester, N. Y.; and just,
hefore returning to Davidson to resume
his duties here, he represented the local
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa at the meet-
ing of the Triennial Council in Cincin-
nati, Ohio.

Persistent Rains Cause

the campus which was halted by rain, will

if the weather continues to be fair. It

hoped that this work can be resumed
immediately so that the roads will be
completed and ready for use by the time
of the next home football game, which
is on October 20.

With the completion of the new hard
surfacing, in connection with the gen-
eral program of rehabilitation in prog-
ress at Davidson, the students will be
relieved of the muddy condition of the
walks that caused

= ... just about every cigarette smoker knows
that—but here are some other facts to keep in mind...
For a cigarette to be milder and taste better it must be
made of mild, ripe Turkish and home-grown tobaccos.
We wish you could go into the factories and see
Chesterfield made, The mild ripe tobacco is cut in
long even threads—then packed into the cigarette so
as to make Chesterfield draw right and burn evenly.
A good cigarette can give you a lot of pleasure, and we
would like for you to try Chesterfield.
