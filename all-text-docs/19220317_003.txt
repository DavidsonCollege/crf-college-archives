DR. ROBERT H. H. GOHEEN TO
BE HERE FOR TWO DAYS

Dr. Robert H. H. Goheen will be the
speaker at the Y. M. C. A. service next
Sunday evening, Dr. Goheen has been
for a number of years in medical work
in India and is spending his vacation
speaking to American colleges on the
opportunities that await surgeons and
doctors in the foreign field. We have
not had a medical missionary as our
guest for two or three years and the
coming of Dr. Goheen is all the more
‘welcomed.

In” addition to the “Y” service Dr.
Goheen will speak to the Medical Club,
to.the classes in Biology and Zoology,
and to other groups. He has made a
special study of Parasitology and Dis-
eases of the Tropics; and his talks on
these subjects have been most interest-
ing and enlightening. During his “off
hours” Dr. Goheen will hold personal
conferences with any medical students
who wish to see him with regard to
preparation or plans for the future.

WALLACE REID COMING HERE

: MOVIE

Champion,” another of Cecil B. DeMille’s

man and an athlete all sport lovers may
be assured of some real action when
Wally and his big fist and réady smile
get busy. .

MINISTERIAL BAND HEAR
DR. VANDER MEULEN
ON TOLERANCE

At their meeting last Sunday after-
roon the Ministerial Band was espe-
cially favored by a talk from Dr. Vander
Meulen. An unusually large number of
members, besides many visitors, were
present, Dr. Vander Meulen spoke to
the “embryo preachers,” as he called
them, upon the types. of temperaments
with which they would come in contact
in their religious work. The talk was
one that should prove helpful and
broadening to the members of the band
in their contact with human nature.

Dr. Vander Meulen spoke of the Greek
classification of temperament: the
phlegmatic, the melancholic, the choleric,
and the sanguine. He then gave the
more modern classification: the intel-
lectual, the emotional, and the practical,
and spoke of these as exhibited in dif-
ferent religious types. Each of these
types, he said, has its place in the
church.

The intellectual class includes the
thinkers and theologians of the church,
who reason out and classify the great
religious truths. «It is they who defend
the faith against the attacks of heretics
and agnostics.

The emotional class includes the be-
lievers in  heart-religion, with such
evangelists as Moody and Wesley. Here
are included, also, the great hymn writ-
crs, David among the great list.

The practical class includes those who
believe in practical religion and go about
Christian work in a practical way.

All of these types have their places,
Only when they deny the existence of
any other kind of religion except their
cwn, are they harmful. Dr. Vander
Meulen said that any minister would
necessarily come into contact with all
of these different. types and it was up to
him to develop himself so as to be able
to sympathize and deal with each of
these classes according to its particular
needs,

C. E. TRAINING CLASS IS TO
HAVE DEPUTATION WORK

At the regular meeting of the Christian
Endeavor Training Class last week it was
decided to start a series of deputations
similar to those now sent out by other
religious organizations on the hill. The
purpose of these deputations is to pro-
tnote the work of the various young
people’s societies in and around David-
sun. The leader of the Christian En-
deavor Training Class appointed a com-
mittee to look after the deputation work,
with J. L. McLean as its chairman,

Since the Training Class was organ-
ized last fall, it has discussed the gen-
eral problems confronting our mission-
aries in foreign fields. Since Christmas
they have organized a class in Expert
Endeavor which has been doing splen-
did work. The deputations are merely
another phase of the work being done
by the Training Class and it is hoped
that this new line of effort will prove
useful to those societies and churches
which can be reached.

Y. M. C. A. DEPUTATIONS BEING
PLANNED FOR SPRING

The Y. M. C. A, committee on deputa-
tions has planned an extensive program
for its department this spring. Harold
McKeithan is the head of this depart-
ment and has arranged several trips, es-
pecially to high schools and prep schools
nearby.

The first deputation will go to Kings
Mountain on next week-end, March 109-
21. They will talk to the high school
boys there on several subjects. This
group will consist of J. P. Price, Edgar
Houghton, G. B. Sorrells, A. M. Hill-
house, and Doc LaFar.

Last year a committee went to Shelby
and its work was so successful that they
have asked for another, J. P. Price, O.
J. Allison, and Harold McKeithan will
compose this “follow-up” group. West-
ninster prep school has also asked for
another deputation, which will be sent
later in the spring. :

Since Christmas, each month two men
have gone down to speak to the Char-
lotte Hi-Y. These trips will be continued
throughout the spring.

McKeithan is in correspondence with
Monroe, Rock Hill, Oak Ridge, and Lex-
ington, concerning trips for the spring.
The deputations have been unusually
snecessful this year. Their chief aim is
to help the high school boys meet prob-
tems which college men have already met
and to give some added incentives to
the high school boys to come to college.

“SATURDAY NIGHT” A STRONG
CECIL B. DEMILLE PICTURE
“Saturday Night” was good. DeMille

knows how to get and hold your inter-

cst and his cast can keep it. The story

goes— d

A rich society girl is about to an-
nounce her engagement to an equally
rich and well-known man of the higher
strata. Her jealousy of her fiance's at-
tention to a working girl whom he has
helped out of-a trying position starts
things “hummin’.” Her own chauffeur is
attractive and she marries him after see-
ing his bravery in saving her life on a
railroad trestle.

The man is all too glad to be free, and
to marry the little poor girl. The poor
girl with no society manners and more
love for “chewing gum and hot dogs than
for operas and olives,” finds a hopeless
situation among the “four hundred” de-
spite her adoring husband,

Cooking for a man whose main object
in eating is to eat and that in the most
convenient and quickest way brings out
all the drudgery where the rich girl had
merely looked for joy.

So, as “water and oil will not mix,” the
water, as it always does, sought its own
level. The poor girl and the chauffeur
find happiness together and years later
the broken society engagement mends
itself.
