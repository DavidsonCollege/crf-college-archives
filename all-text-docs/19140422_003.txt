DAVIDSON MEN AT UNION
SEMINARY.

Davidson Represented in all the
Activities.

The following letter has been received
fron W. S. Golden ('13), now at

Union Seminary, Richmond:

“Davidson men at Union Seminary
welcome with interest and pride, the
first issue of the Davidsonian. Its neat
and attractive appearance would do
credit to any institution. The appear-
ance of chea apness, so common in most
college weeklies, is delightfully absent.
The news is told interestingly and at-
tractively. The mail will bring no pub-
lication to the Seminary which will be
more welcome to the Davidson contin:
gent than this weekly batch of news, and
alwavs interesting news.

We are glad indeed to learn that Dr.
Sentelle will preach the, Baccalaureate
Sermon to the Semindry this year.
Many of the Davidson Alumni have not
had the opportunity to see Dr. Sentelle
in some time, and the mere privilege of
meeting him again will be a treat. Of
course it goes without saying that his
sermon will be well worth hearing. Dr.
Sentelle will receive a warm welcome.

At a recent meeting of the student
body, Mr. T. K. Currie was elected
president of the student body for the
next year, succeeding Mr. John L. Fair-
ley, another Davidson Alumnus. -

There has recently been organized in
the Seminary a society for the cultiva-
tion of study and debate on live, and
timely religious questions. The society
has been named in honor of our late be-
loved Professor of Theology, Dr. Strick-
ler, as “The Givens B. Strickler So-
cietv.” The organization is largely due
to the untiring efforts of Mr. C. F. Ar-
trowood ('o9). Mr. O. E. Buckholtz
(09) was elected the first. president.
Mr. C. B. Craig ("t1), has been elected
Vice-president for the coming year. “The
first debate was held March 30th, -and
was in every way a success. The pros-
pects for the new Society are bright; and
it bids fair to fill a long felt need.

The Seminary has heen represented in
a basket-ball league composed of the
strongest teams in the city, this winter.

contenders for first until one-of the
strongest men on the team, Mr. J. L.
Hughes (V. P. I.) was compelled to
give up the game for the. balance of the
season on account of injuries. Two
Davidson men who were regular mem-
bers of the team and played. splendid
hall, wére J. L. Fairley and J. H. Brady
(12). T. H. Dimmock ("10) and H.
G. Bedinger ('11) were valuable sub-
stitutes.

The base-ball seasnn is with us. The
Seminary team has played several games
and while most of the games have been
lost, the team has made a very good
showing considering the short time avail-
able for practice in the afternoons.
R. Lacy is captain of the team, and T.
K. Currie is plaving a nice game at first.

Dr. James Stalker, of Scotland, is
here for ten days. delivering a course o
lectures on the James Sprunt Founda-
tion. His subiect is, “Religious Psychol.
ev, in the Pulpit and in the Pew.”
The opening lecture was attended by a
large and appreciative audience.

PROMINENT DAVIDSON
ALUMNI.

In governmental circles are Congress-
min J. W. Faison, of the Fifth North
Carolina District, and Mr. Banks, who
is Secretary Daniel’s private secretary
and right-hand = man. Ex-Governor
Glenn was a member of the class of '77.
After retiring from the governor's chair,
Mr. Glenn made a tour of the South
speaking in the interest of Home Mis-
sions. Lately he-has accepted a position
on the International Boundary Commnis-
sion.

In the field of education, Davidson
men are exceedingly prominent. Dr.
W. W. Moore, of yenion Theological
Seminary; Dr. ‘T. H. Whaling, of Co-
lumbia Theological Seminary; Dr. D.
M. Douglas, of P. C. of S. C.; Dr.

L. Smith, of Washington ad Lee, and

Dr. W. J. Martin, of Davidson, are
among the college presidents that hold

B.|a Davidson diploma.

Other Davidson men of prominence
in this field are Dr. Axon, of Prince-
ton; Dr. E. B. McGilvary, of the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin; Dr. Egleston, of
Austin College; Dr. J. M. Pharr, of
the University of Florida; Dr. Alphon-

so C. Smith, of the University of Vir-"

ginia ; Dr. W. G. Perry, of Georgia
‘Tech., and Drs. English and Lingle, of
Union Seminary, besides Prof. Joseph
Maclean, of Agnes Scott, who is one of
the foremost musicians in the South.

As Davidson is a Church institution,
her men would be expected to have a
prominent place in Church affairs,
which is indeed the case. One-half of
the men now entering the ministry in
the Southern Presbyterian Church are
Davidson men, and this college is large-
ly represented on the faculties of our
Seminaries. Some of the most prominent
Davidson alumni in this field are Dr.
J. F. Cannon, of the Westminster
church, St. Louis, who is also ex-mod-
erator of the Northern General Assem-
blv; Dr. W. B. Jennings, of the First
Presbyterian church, of Germantown,
Pa.; Dr. W. S. Plumber Bryan, of the
Church of the Covenant, Chicago, and
Dr. Egbert W. Smith, Secretary of
Foreign Missions in the Southern Pres-
byterian Church.

Mr. William Mack, who graduated
from Davidson in '83, with second hon-
or, and the degrees of AB and M.A, is
recognized the country over as an-au-

what lawvers refer to as “C Y C,”
otherwise known as “Cyclopedia of Law
and’ Procedure. This work has become
a Standard Authority among the legal
Profession, There are 40 volumes of
the “Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure”
already published. which are an endur-
ing testimonial of his skill and industry.

The Davidson Library is grateful to
Mr. Mack; for recently he presented his
Alma Mater a set of his works, valued
at $300.

TO THE ALUMNI.

The time for gathering new men
for next fall has come. “We do all in
the office here we cin to secure the right
sort_ of men for the College, but we
must and do depend largely. on our old
meyand our friends to secure the best
type of new men for us.

Let me suggest to every Alumnus tg
try within the next three months to
secure at least one good recruit for our
Freshman Class. -Lav vourself out to
secure one well-prepared student, of
high moral character, and earnestness
of purpose, and send him to Davidson
as your representative, to take your
place in the old college and receive its

advantages. ;
Let us make the next Freshman Class
the best in preparation, purpose, and

character, that the College has ever vet
welcomed. F-very one will have to help
if we do this, for we have had fine
classes in the past. Start out for these
men now, before the schools close and
pupils and teachers scatter for the sum-
mer. Let them come from far and near.
Davidson serves the whole South and
Christian education generally. Instill
in all matriculates the purpose to suc-
ceed, to take a straight degree course,
and stick to it tl his diplama is. won.

Will not all the Alumni join us in
this effort? My ambition for the col-
lege is efficiency rather than. size, but we
want fully as many men as we have this
year.

Let us all go to work at once in the
interest of Davidson College..
Yours in the service of the old College,

Wm. J. Martin.

ALUMNI NOTES.

of Agnes Scott College, by three men,
Prof. Joseph Maclean, Head of the de-
partment of Music; Dr. J. S$. Guy, Pro-
fessor of Chemistry, and Dr. W. T.
Stukes, Professor of Bible. — Certainly
they should have no hard feelings to-

ard us for taking one man from their
faculty this vear.

A good many letters have been re-
ceived from the alumni, following -the
issue of the DAVIDSONITAN.
Below are extracts from some of them.

“The first issue of the DAVIDSO-
NIAN was received some days ago, and
I was very glad indeed to get it. The
paper is a little beam, and I hope you
will be able to keep it up to the place
vou have started with it.”

“T was delighted to see in The Char- | Ee@eeoooooooooooooecoooee et:
lotte Observer that Davidson was at last
to have a weekly paper. [ have wished
for a Davidson paper many times this
year, I think it will do more than any
other one thing to keep the alumni_in-
terested in the school.”

“IT hope the paper will be a success,
and it will give me great pleasure to help
any undertaking, as an Alumnus, of
Davidson College.”

Others have said, “Have my name put
on your mailing list for this and next
year.’

‘Such statements as these speak for
