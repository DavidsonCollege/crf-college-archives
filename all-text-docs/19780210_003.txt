Professor brings son to work

Case baby goes to college

Last fall, Assistant Profes-
sor of Biology Verna Case and
her husband Marshal began
considering alternatives for
the day care of their new son,
Jefferson Matthew.

Instead of a babysitter, or a
day care center, she, with the
consent of Associate Professor
Donald Kimmel, began bring-
ing him to work this quarter.

“IT wanted to bring him
because it is important to have
a lot of interaction between
child and parent,’’ Case noted.
“A home environment is bet-
ter in the sense that it is more
stable, but any child that has
a lot of interaction in any
situation is less fearful of
others.”’

Eight-month-old Jefferson
spends most of his time in
Case’s office, either sleeping or

The SGA allocated $100 to
aid the Office of Admissions in
making phone calls to encou-
rage prospective students to
come to Davidson.

The money to fund this
project came from the Senate’s
General Fund category.

This telephone calling pro-
gram was set up by the SGA
Senate because it was ‘‘look-
ing for programs to help. This
stemmed from an effort in the
Senate to give some direction
to its use of money,”’ said
SGA President Thom Young.

The group of people called
were chosen because of SAT
scores and_ self-reported
grades. Director of Admis-
sions H. Edmund White said,
“At this point, they appear to
be good prospects.”

There were no specific num-
ber of people called, but the
concentration was on male
applicants because of the
trustee policy on female enroll-
ment.

In stating reasons why fe-
male applicants were not
called, White said that they
had received approximately
460 female applications of
which only 110 can be en-
rolled. He continued that 300
to 400 of these applications
can be considered well quali-
fied; about 100 applicants can
be considered extremely well
qualified.

White pointed ‘out that it
seemed pointless to call a

female applicant and encour-
age her to apply when there is
no more room. He said, ‘‘If we
didn’t get another single ap-
plication from a girl, we’d
have an extremely strong
freshman class.”’

playing with toys.

He does, however, accom-
pany his mother occasionally
to animal behavior class.
The students seem to enjoy his
visits, and ‘‘we use him as a

model of early childhood deve-
lopment.”’

Case expressed her thanks
to her fellow professors and
the school for allowing the
“experiment.’’ ‘I appreciate
the openness of the college.
This would not be possible at
many other schools or under
other circumstances.”’

She also pointed out that
‘he is a little leery of kids his
own age,” and plans for him to
spend next quarter with a
babysitter and other children.

RHC seeks-funds

By CLAY MACAULAY
Staff Writer

’ Chairman of the Residence
Hall Council (RHC) Bruce
Brown announced this week
that he is seeking additional
funds for the improvement of all
dorm lounges.

“There’s obviously a need,”’
said.Brown. ‘‘Dorm lounges are
potentially useful.’

Director of Student Housing
Scotty Nicholls questioned
whether additional funds were
the answer. ‘‘We could spend a
fortune on the lounges but
people abuse them,’’ said Nich-
olls, referring to chair cushions
and paintings that have disap-
peared from the lounges.

“On top of that,’’ she added,
“a TV set was stolen out of
(Dormitory) over
Thanksgiving.”’

Nicholls said money was av-
ailable for refurbishing the
lounges but didn’t know exactly
what the RHC wanted.

‘“Remodeling’’ was Brown’s
reply. ‘‘In general, new furni-
ture, fixed TV’s and more
recreational equipment.”

Brown agreed with Scotty
Nicholls on the problem of
student negligence but pointed
out that if the lounges were kept
nice and clean (i.e. the trash
cans emptied continuously) stu-
dents in turn would attempt to
keep it nice.

He added that by impressing

for dorm lounges

the need of student upkeep of
the lounge, and emphasizing
more responsibility on the
house managers to keep a
sharper eye out for the lounge
vandals, this would also help
alleviate the problem.

‘‘The lounges are not big
enough for social events,’’
states the Dorm Social Commit-
tee Chairman, Mary Chester
Morgan. ‘‘Even if they were the
furniture is falling apart,”’

Nicholls conceded that the
lounges were small, but said
nothing could be done until the
student housing crunch is
solved and rooms are vacated in
each dorm.

‘‘Ideally,’’ said Nicholls,
‘‘there would be lounges on
every floor of all dorms, espe:
cially Belk dorm where 321
students are housed.” ;

She pointed out that there is
a kitchen on the top floor of
Belk, and that by student
request, lockers have been in-
stalled there to accomodate
students’ personal cooking
items.

Both Brown, who has an
appointment to talk with Col-
lege President Samuel R. Spen-
cer, Jr. about the matter next
week, and Nicholls, expressed
optimism in finding a solution
to the problem.

“If reform is the case, then
everything possible will be done
to remedy the lounge situ-
ation,’’ said Nicholls.
