UNUSUAL

In a day when magazines and newspapers are crying in
loud voices of the professionalism in college football, an al-
most unnoticed incident on the local campus comes as quite
an encouragement to fans of collegiate sports.

After second-string center Frank Anderson was aided
off the field with an injured leg during the P.C. game, Coach
Bill Dole was left with a line whose middle spot was weak in
reserves for the next several encounters.

BUT TWO MORE

However it was not a problem of great concern until
two more centers, Lewis Moore and Charlie James were hurt
in practice only a few days before the Stetson game.

Needing Dole
turned to a boy who had not even

reinforcements,

practiced with the team in over a
month. John Nix, a non-scholarship
athlete who last year as a freshman
played junior varsity football, re-
turned to school early this fall for
Pre-season drill and was a leading

senter prospect, but dropped out
when school began because of his studies.

TWO HOURS

The coach attempted to see John the night before the
game but not finding him in his room left a note. Very much
surprised to find the message, Nix was happy to aid the team
but did not hope to see action. Unexcited he did not report
until two hours before the game Saturday afternoon.

The big surprise came in the fourth quarter when the
Cats were enjoying a comfortable lead. Sending in replace-
ments, Dole turned to Nix and asked if he wanted to play.
Anxious for his first (and probably his last) chance to play
college football, John readily said yes. He played about six
minutes of the game.

ANYONE ELSE

Seeming a little amazed that such an occurence would
attract any publicity, the modest center said later, “I don’t
feel that I’ve done anything special. Anyone else would have
done the same if he had been in my position; I was glad to
have the opportunity to help and to play.

Perhaps ‘anyone else” would have, but the simple in-
cident still seems worthy of note not only because of its
unusualness but also because of the spirit of amateurism it
reveals.

With football -considered little more than big busi-
ness on many campuses, it is obvious that such an occurrence
couldn't happen often today.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

dets. Other VMI players are Evanusich (83) and O'Neill (78).

SOCCER SQAUD BOWS
TO GENERALS, 2-0

By CHARLES McGOWAN

The Wildcat soccer squad fell in defeat last Friday when
The Generals of Washington and Lee out-booted the locals

2-0 on the home field.

The Davidson team played fast,
aggressive ball the entire game oc-
cupying Washington and Lee's
portion of the field almost, half
of the game. It was late in the
second quarter when the opposi-
tion. kicked their first goal. and
stepped out in front of the Wild-
cats.

FREE KICK SCORE

During the second half, the local
squad played outstanding defensive
ball as they have all season, but

a penalty against the Cats cost |

Most of the emphasis in daily drill
was put on offense, a weakness of
the squad since they have been
scoreless thus far in the season.

The defensive squad of the Wild-
cats is as strong ‘as any team’s
which they have met, a fact proven
when Davidson held powerful Ca-
rolina to 2-0 in a contest two weeks
ago. although they were unable
to score themselves.

The contest with the Generals
will begin at 3:00 tomorrow after-
noon. It is the game that Coach
McCutchan is hoping to win be-

them another goal when the Gen.’ Cause the Cats know W&L's tactics

erals made the free kick. Both
teams made desperate attempts to
score in the few remaining min-
utes, but were unsuccessful. When

the whistle blew ending the game,'

the score was still 2-0.

Shining for the Cats both de-
fensively and offensively were
Smyth, Reeder, Russell, and An-
drews. Butler, the goalie, deserves
special attention, not only for his
outstanding job in last Friday's
game, but also for the superior de-
fensive work which he has been
doing all season.

OFFENSE DRILL

The Cat footsters worked hard
this weck in preparation for to-
morrow’'s return game with Wash-
ington and Lee in Lexington, Va.

Harriers Run Wild;
Take Deacons, 26-32

The Davidson harriers came vic-
torious out of Tuesday's meet with
Wake Forest. On a 4.3 miles colirse
in the Deacon's new home town,
Davidson's better team balance
proved decisive in the close con-
test which ended with a 26-32
score.

Angus McBryde once again led
the Wildcat runners with a second
place.

individual victor was Med-
lin of Wake Forest, whose
finishing kick was foo much
for McBryde. Both men ran
tactical races and depended
on a fast finish, where Medlin
turned out to be the better
sprinter.

Ramm, Smith, Half.

Henry Brown took third place,
well behind the two leaders, and
was followed by a duo of Wake
Forest runners. Al Elder, Ray Ant-
ley, and frosh Jim Alexander com-
pleted the scoring Davidson quin-
tet, and another freshman, Milton
Gee, followed immediately behind.

Pete Ashcraft, senior and cap-
tain of the Cat harriers, did not
see action because of a recent leg
injury.

This Saturday Coach Whittle’s
1956 squad matches strength with
the University of Richmond in the
only home meet of the season.
Richmond seems to have an im-
proved team from last year, and
has a top man in Warren Chukinas

The only teams that really
threatened the rebels in actu-
al games were the Kappa Sigs
and the Sigma Chi’s. The Kap-
pa Sigs fell short by @ single

of the year, while the Sigma
Chi’s were edged, 12 to 6, in
another very good contest.
After a fine start at the begin-

ning of the season, both the Sigma
Chi’s and S.A.E.’s began losing im-
portant games toward the end and
eventually tied for fifth place.

Buddy Davis. Backing them up are

is the forte of the Richmond back-
field.
LINE PLAY

Richmond has good depth at
guard and end, but the vital center
and tackle spots are somewhat
weaker. The ‘Cat line is expected
to hold its own against the Rich-
mond forward wall.

Citadel, victors over Davidson by
a 33-6 count dropped a 7-3 contest
to Richmond. V.M.L, the only other
common Upponent, caught the
Spiders napping in their web and
managed to defeat them.

Bad breaks have played a large
part in the rather dismal Rich-
mond showing thus far, and they
cannot be discounted on the basis
of their record alone.

Line coach Pride Ratterree, who
has scouted the Spiders, had this
to say: “They have a strong ball
club — Probably one of the tough-
est teams we'll play all year.”

VM TIE

In last week's game, V.M.L
pulled a defeat out of the fire and
turned it into a tie by knotting
the score at 13-13 with but 53
seconds remaining to play. The ty-
ing touchdown came on a twelve
yard pass play, after a ‘Cat fumble
had given the Keydets the ball
deep in Davidson territory.. A per-
fect kick, which traveled out of
the stadium, completed the effort.

Offensively, Don McRee was the
whole show, scoring both David-
son TD’s. He is now in fourth

If it had not been for one ex-| »

have undoubtedly increased his al-
ready impressive rushing record
and the Keydets might still be
singing a victory song.

But - when, Woolwine dared a

as a season record, and was last
approximated by a 97 yard run-
back by Roy White against Har-
vard in 1952. The other score came
on a two yard slant off left tackle.

EVEN MATCH

Statistics reveal how evenly
matched the teams were. Both
clubs had sixteen first downs and
were penalized almost the same
distance. The total offensive yard-
age differed by four yards — 217
for Davidson and 22! for the Key-
dets.

Although the Homecoming crowd
of 7,000 was dissatisfied with be-
ing robbed of a victory in the final
minute, the game was regarded
as a remarkable effort on the part
of the Wildcats.

Head Coach Bill Dole comment-
ing on the rest of the schedule,
said: “The last 3 games (Richmond,
Wofford, and Furman) are all
tough, and we’ll really have to be
on top of our game to win them.”

Cagers Emphasize
Fundamentals in Drill

The Wildcat basketball team is
stressing fundamentals as the third
week of early practice draws to
a close.

Of the forty-eight hopefuls who
turned out for the initial practice,
twenty-eight. remain as candidates
for varsity positions.

No distinction will be made be-
tween varsity and JV’s until about
the middle of November. Coach
Tom Scott. says that this is being
done to give the freshmen and
sophomores an opportunity to
prove themselves and win a vaf-
sity berth.

The group, practicing daily,
is stressing only fundamentals.
Ball handling, passing, and
learning to work together have
comprised the main empha-
sis of these early workouts.

Coach Scott, asked to camment
on the progress, said that it was
too early to single out any indl-
viduals as outstanding. However,
he stated, “In looking at it from
this stage of practice, the fresh-
man group, in general, tooks better
than last years, and a few of the
freshmen are giving stiff compe-
tition to some of the lettermen for
a varsity position.”
