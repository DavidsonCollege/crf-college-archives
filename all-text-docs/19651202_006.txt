Tuesday's chapel speaker, Ed-
ward A. Wayne, fourth in a
series of speakers on economics,
brought not only a wide back-
ground of experience in central
banking, but also a reputation
sufficient to win for him even
the admiration of Davidson's
usually complacent student
body.

Wayne Is the president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Rich-
mond and boasts a list of cre-
dits and honors long enough to
impress any “incredibly brilll-
ant group of men," as he tact-
fully referred to his audience.

The American Red Cross
Bloodmobile will visit Davidson
on Monday and Tuesday in its
semi - annual, ROTC - sponsored
visit.

Blood donations will be re-
ceived from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
each day in Johnston Gymnas-
ium. Signs will be posted to
guide students to the proper
locations.

This year’s drive will again
feature competition among fra-
ternities for a plaque award.
The award will go to the fra-

All ROTC students who wish
to donate blood have an option.
Those who give blood will be
granted an excused absence
from drill on Tuesday afternoon.
Ten merits will be awarded
awarded those who give blood
and also attend drill.

According to Captain J. B.

Student Survey Brings
ROTC Policy Changes

By KERN PARKER
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Recent changes in the policies
and procedures of the ROTC de-
partment resulting from last
spring’s student survey were dis-
cussed recently in a DAVIDSON-
IAN interview with Col. Frede-
rick Outlaw, professor of mili-
tary science.

“We decided to make the sur-
vey.’ said Outlaw, “in order to
find out what changes the stu-
dents felt would improve the
department. We already knew
that some corrective action was
necessary. but felt that the stu-
dents might be able to point out
some problems that had not
come to our attention.”

Perhaps the major change
that resulted from the survey
is the department's use of es-
say tests in place of the old ob-

jective tests. Students complain- .

ed about questions that required
a knowledge of insignificant
facts or the memorization of
long lists.

Outlaw said that in this mat-
ter the students confirmed an
ov’nion already held by the
ROTC faculty.

A second major change re-
sulting from the survey is the

postponement of drill from 1:30.

to 2 p.m. ‘“‘We hadh’t realized,"
said Outlaw. “that students hav-
ing a fourth period class might
have difficulty making it to drill
on time.

“The survey also influenced
our decision to reduce the num-
ber of required rifle cleanings
per month. We plan a further re-
duction if the students show a
co-operative attitude,"’ Outlaw

Phone Installation
Sel For Weekend

Seven new coin telephones
are scheduled to be in opera-
tion by tomorrow, according to

the Office of the Supervisor of

Dormitories.

The phones were delivered
yesterday and telephone work-
men are supposed to be at
work installing wires today and
tomorrow.

New phones were installed in
the Union game room, outside
the Student Store, in the center
section of Duke dorm and on the
third floors of Watts, Little, Can-
mon and East dorms.

added.

He explained that the decision
to have a variety of programs
and exhibits during drill period
as well as actual marching stem-
med from both ROTC faculty
opinion and student opinion ex-
pressed in the survey..

“We had it under considera-
tion,’ Outlaw said. ‘and when
the students indicated a need
for it we decided to go ahead.”

“The students also wanted to
eliminate confusion and mis-
understandings in drill, so now
we require the officers of each
company to meet and discuss
drill procedure before Tuesday
afternoon.

Outlaw added that the merit-
demerit system was revised as
a result of the survey.

Outlaw remarked that since
last year the department has

been trying to expose the stu-
dents to a variety of professors,
instead of having them meet
with one all the time. Now each
professor teaches the aspect of
military science with which he
is most familiar.

‘We're still attempting to im-
prove the program,’ Outlaw
commented. “Sophomores and
freshmen have selected commit-
tees to meet with me and dis-
cuss further changes.

“We also plan to place more
emphasis on individual effort
this year, particularly with the
freshmen. We're going to give
more promotions and establish
more ranks. The freshman has
never been recognized; we in-
tend to give him recognition in
the form of rank.

‘We also intend to form com-
panies composed entirely of

members of one class — all

leadership capabilities in non-
officers.

“Student response has been
definitely favorable thus far,
and we hope it will continue to
be. The entire ROTC program is
under study on a nation-wide
basis, but we're going to make
revisions as we see a need for
them without waiting for con-
ferences of the Department of
the Army.

“When we see a change is
needed,” Outlaw concluded,
“we're going to make it.”’

In presenting the title of his
discussion, “Discipline and the
Free Enterprise System,”
Wayne admitted that his topic
seemed to be a contradiction in
terms, but explained, as he later
illustrated, that a system of en-
terprise such as the Ameriean
one must necessarily have some
form of restraint built into it if
it is to remain free to govern
itself.

The Federal Reserve System
is such a restraint on the type of
enterprise which exists today, a
restraint which boasts rather
than hinders this system.

The Reserve System is unique
in that it is the only banking
system built to contribute to the

For Students’ Blood

work for several hours helping
with the drive.

In order for students under 21
to make donations, the written
permission of the students’ par-
ents must be obtained. Forms
for obtaining this permission
were distributed at drill on Nov.
23. This form also releases the
American Red Cross from any
claims of damages because of
the blood donation.

In addition to the option to
ROTC students and the inter
fraternity competition, a free cut
will be awarded to Physical
Education students who donate
blood.

benefit of the greatest number
by both public and private in-
terest, he said.

This dual interest is very im-
portant and even vital to such a
system because of our type of
free enterprise.

It is ‘designed to avoid the

concentration of too much power °

in a small group,"’ said Wayne,
but at the same time it avoids
the pitfalls feared by so many
Americans which may accomp-
any a completely government
controlled bank.

In practice, the system func-
tions on the principle that it is
necessary to hold a reserve on
the amount of deposit each bank
has at hand, the South Carolina
native explained. The control is
held by the central reserve
bank which holds these reserves
and can let the economy expand,
but still keeping it from expand-
ing too fast.

The Federal Reserve Bank {s
composed of a Board of Gover-
nors in Washington which has
the power to supervise and co-
ordinate all 12 district reserve
batiks. ‘

The district banks in turn have
the right to vote for the directors
of the system, which include
six bankers, three. businessmen
and three men who do not even
own stock in a bank.

These 12 men, who meet in
Washington every three weeks to
decide the policies of the system
until the next meeting, know the
exact economic situation all over
the world at the time that they
are making their deliberations.

banking systems, according to

EDWARD A. WAYNE
Advocates “Shared Freedom”

Wayne, is either a system of
complete contro! by the state or
one of no state control at all —
anarchy.

The former is alien to our way
of life. Wayne said, and the lat-
ter is not any more Teqsibip/be-
cause in our society the-attions
of every man affect and are too

closely affected by the actions
of others.

“The only freedom is a shared
freedom,’’ in a system such as
this which affects the national
economy: so vitally and that is
why, as Wayne stressed, ‘'we
must be prepared to accept dis-
cipline even when it hits us per-
sonally."" To remain free we
must have self-restraint.

The Student Council elected
four delegates. John Thomas,
Ken Childs, George Nzongola
and Sam Johnson, to represent
Davidson in this series of de-
bates concerning current world

,| problems.

These students, like many
others from various colleges of
the South, will assume the role
of ambassadors from a country
that they wish to represent. The
three-day program will consist
of discussions in political, econo-
mic and social committees and
of a mock general assembly
similar to the United Nations.

John Thomas, one of the de-
legates, said that Davidson
would probably represent either
the United Arab Republic.
France or India.

Because the students must
consider the world . problems
from the standpoint of their se-
lected country. he said that the
Davidson delegates would pro-
bably be concerned with the pro-
blems of the Arab-Israel con-
flict, of De Gaulle and the Com-
mon Market or of the contro-
versy over Kashmir.
