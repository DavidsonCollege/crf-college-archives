Fairley receives tenure

Director of ethnic studies program becomes first -
tenured African-American at Davidson

By Amy WHiTmirRE
Staff writer

Nancy Fairley, a professor of
‘anthropology and sociology and
the director of the ethnic studies
program, has become Davidson’s
first African-American faculty
member to receive tenure.

Fairley began the ethnic stud-
ies program after receiving faculty
approval in March of 1994. The
1994-95 school year has been the
program’s first year.

The program offers an ethnic
studies concentration, for which
students complete six approved
courses and a related hands-on
experience project. It also offers a
lecture series and co-sponsors dif-
ferent campus events.

Eleven students have already
registered to complete a concen-
tration in ethnic studies, and one
member of the class of 1995, Cat
Grimmell, will be Davidson’s first
graduate with a concentration in
ethnic studies.

’ Fairley feels that the ethnic

studies program makes a crucial
contribution to diversity at
Davidson. “I don’t think a com-
mitment to diversity can depend
on the number of individual stu-
dents who come from diverse cul-
tures,” she says. “We must diver-
sify curriculum and cultural intel-
lectual experiences outside the
classroom as well.”

Fairley has also contributed
greatly to Davidson’s anthropol-

ogy department. Because she re- °

ceived her undergraduate degree
from the University of Ghana and
completed her doctoral disserta-
tion in Zaire, she brings a unique
perspective to the school.

Recently, Fairley has been re-
searching ‘African-Americans in
the United States and has begun
studying “ancestor dreams” in the
Carolinas.

She has also created a new
course entitled “Art, Society, and
Culture” which she will teach for

“the first time next semester.

Fairley is working now to cre-
ate a Davidson summer study za

gram at the University of Ghana.
She, along with some Davidson
administrators, faculty, and stu-
dents, hopes to present this pro-
posal to the faculty in 1995-96.
This international experience
would offer students a new per-
spective on ethnic relations and
expose them toa different and more
egalitarian.perception of life.

Fairley feels that the opportu-
nity to study in Africa is important,
especially considering America’s
African heritage. She hopes that
the program might bring students a
“new respect for humanity.”

When asked what she likes
most about Davidson, Fairley
stated that she liked the opportu-
nity at Davidson of “getting to
know one’s students and col-
leagues. Davidson has small
classes, and its students in general
are well-prepared for college.
Davidson has resources for both
students and faculty, and it has a
both a high level of commitment to
its students and funds to support
that level of education.”

Athletic scholarships on the rise

Holland believes increased funding will. make Davidson athletics more competitive

By JOANNA JOHNSON

New attention has been fo-
cused on fundraising’ for athletic
scholarships, as top recruits are
accepting better financial aid pack-
ages at other institutions.

The Davidson Athletic Foun-
dation hopes to be able to provide
more merit-based scholarships,
both named and unnamed, to
complement financial aid pack-
ages.

The scholarships range from
$3,000 to $6,000 each, enough to
lessen the gap which has caused
top recruits to accept offers from
competitive Ivy League schools
instead of Davidson.

Terry Holland, Director of
Athletics, says, “We need the flex-

ibility to offer better financial aid
packages than our ‘competitors. ns
The” athletic department is

funded in part by the Davidson
Athletic Foundation. The founda-
tion receives a portion of the
school’s total budget, which has
been as much as 9.6% in recent
years. °

This year, the portion was
capped at 9.2%, resulting in a cut
of $600,000.

The Athletic Foundation is
now campaigning to raise this
needed support. Dubbed “The
$600,000 Plan,” the campaign has
already raised $350,000 for ath-
letic scholarships.

Because of this, 15 additional
athletes were awarded non-need
based aid this year, bringing the
total percentage of athletic schol-
arship recipients to 20%.

The remaining $250, 000 will
be raised from Athletic Founda-
tion contributors and from named
scholarships. With the help of
Institutional Advancement and
Development Offices, the athletic
department:-will continually try to
target those alumni who may have
aspecial interest in supporting ath-
letics.

Already, Terry Holland states,
“Donors are recognizing the great
value of scholarships for outstand-
ing student.athletes.”

Donors have traditionally sup-

plore our options of how to finance
it [risk management].”

The task force’s first meeting
was the Wednesday after Easter,
and last Tuesday the plan, which
was Coonley’s, was adopted by an
unanimous vote by all eight mem-
bers present.

The task force was comprised
of nine members, including senior
independent senator Jonathan Orr
and Political Science Professor
Mary Thornberry. Another inde-
pendent was invited to join the task
force but declined because of
schedule conflicts.

The task force assumed that
risk management costs for next
year will be $22,000, approxi-
mately what this year’s cost was.
The Dean of Students’ Office will
be returning $500 of users’ fees to
each heuse which will be put to-
ward risk management and

amounts to $5,000. The task force
expects about 200 independents to
become “Court members,” mak-
ing their contribution to risk man-
agement $4,000. The remaining
$13,000 will come from students
presently affiliated with a house
and from pledges in the spring.

If200 independents do not opt
into the plan, freshmen may be
asked to pay $10 in their first
sememster. If there is a budget
surplus at the end of next year, the
funds will be recycled back into
the risk management fund.

Shames says that house and
Court members will receive stick-
ers to put on their IDs without
which no one will be able to get
into parties. House members will
receive the stickers from their
houses, but Shames has not de-
cided how independents will get
their stickers. He speculates it may
be at registration.

Coonley thinks this is a fair
and affordable plan. He points out
that the cost for an independent is
$0.67 per week, “the cost of one
coke from a soda machine.”

Orr, the sole independent on
the taskforce, is very satisfied with
the plan. He describes the taskforce
sessions as “very convival. Every-
body was very fair. We were look-
ing for the most fair option pos-
sible, and I think we have that.”

When the first plan was an-
nounced nearly a month ago, Orr
explains that he had some objec-
tions. “My problem was that no-
body asked the independents. To
leave the independents out is to
undermine [the open social scene].”

Rather than limit indepen-
dents’ presence and influence on
the Court, Orr thinks, “Tt [the plan]
will be unifying on campus ...
We're [independents] paying for
our share ... to make sure the par-
ties are safe. It will make the
independents feel like they are in-
volved.”

At last night’s meeting,
Coonley formally introduced the
plan before the Council for adop-
tion. Orralso attended the meeting
to officially represent indepen-
dents’ interests.

; The athletic, department
“would like to see the same support
forallof the 20 varsity sportsteams,
with the exception of football,
which is prohibited by conference
regulations to use unnamed schol-
arship money.

The athletic department will
try to be equitable with the new
unnamed scholarship money re-
ceived.

Holland also insists on dis-
tributing the scholarship money
with gender equity in mind, say-
ing, “We have made every effort to
support women’s athletics just as
faithfully as the men’s teams.”

Currently, women’s sports re-

ceive slightly over half ofthe schol-
arship money.

the new scholarship money is:cru-
cial in helping the college attract
student athletes who will enhance
the character and integrity of

Davidson.

Davidson is set apart from
other small liberal arts colleges in
part because of outstanding aca-
demics coupled with Division I
sports.

Richards says, “Without Di-
vision I sports, what will separate
Davidson from an Amherst or a
Williams?”
