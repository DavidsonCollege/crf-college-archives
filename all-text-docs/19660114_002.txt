Another New Challenge

Certain students grossly displayed
their ineptitude at demure thinking in
this week’s referendum when less
than one-third of the student body
voted to repeal the. drinking rule from
the Student Body Constitution.

What is so astonishing is not that
the drinking rule was taken off the
books, but that no other regulation
was repealed at the same time.

After nearly one-half of a semes-
ter of extensive debate on the merits
of the Student Body Regulations, only
45 per cent of the student body mark-
ed ballots in Tuesday's voting. which
was marred unfortunately by an
abortive referendim held last month.
(Notwithstanding, the freshman class,
or approximately 25 per cent of the
student body. did not vote this week.)

The very regulations which should
have been smitten from the record
were left untouched.

Provisions against gambling and
hazing no longer belong in the Student
Body Regulations. Gambling is not
prevalent and has always been an
ambiguous term of reference through
the years. Furthermore, hazing be-
longs under the supervision of the
Interfraternity Council and not under
student body rules as a whole.

Perhaps the unique debate in Mon-
day’s assembly is excuse for the bun-
gling in the balloting. The arguments

welled solely on the drinking rule
question and did not mention the
other provisions.

Perhaps the lack of proper public-
ity and usual reminders on the voting
day explains the sparse turnout of
voters and, therefore, the doubts as to
the true reflection of student opinion
on this matter.

We could dwell on various other
speculations concerning the prepara-
tions for the voting. _

Instead, we are inclined to believe
that the greatest shortcoming of the
entire matter is the unprecedented
vote on the.entire body of Student
Body Regulations.

The idea of submitting the whole
body of rules periodically to a vote
of the students is closely comparable
to placing the general statutes of a

state to a vote of the people every
generation.

Nevertheless, the student body
drinking rule is no more; so, what
does the future bring?

College administrators were no-
ticeably quiet this week, but whether
stunned or embittered remains to be
seen. Faculty members, having spent
much of their meeting time this year
discussing the drinking rule, should
be loath to begin another semester on
the subject.

Furthermore, we can see no justifi-
cation for immediate action on the
part of the faculty, assuming the con-
tinuation of the current bearing of
the student body:

Therein lies the true significance
of the one vote that decided the out-
come of the referendum. The con-
tinued good conduct of students re-
flected in their matureness and over-
all demeanor will undoubtedly be
measured closely in the future by the
administration.

No roadblocks, no dormitory checks,
and no breath analysers have been
placed into operation since the re-
sults of the voting were announced.
and we can foresee no such steps,
considering the prudence of both fac-
ulty and students.

The 301 votes pushed an added
measure of responsibility on each
student; for, as long as the faculty
regulation remains in effect. there is
actually no provision for initial juris-
diction by students in this area.

Also, there is a definite need for a
clear understanding among the ad-
ministration, the faculty and student
leaders under the new circumstances.
Any unnecessary delay in effecting
such a mutual interpretation of the
situation through the Student-Faculty
Coordinating Committee mav prove to
be a rather unfortunate one.

Every student now has the chal-
lenge to uphold even more strongly
his position in the community on cam-
pus .and the opportunity thereby to
accept even greater responsibilities in
the future.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Junior Calls For Students
To' Assume Responsibility’

Dear Editor:

The results of the voting on
Tuesday's Referendum show a
lack of thought and understand-
ing by the Student Body. Now
that all students are equally
responsible for enforcement of
the Student Body Regulations,
the purpose of the Referendum
was to eliminate unnecessary
and unenforceable rules. By re-
taining the rules against gam-
bling and -hazing, we have de-
feated the whole purpose of the
Referendum.

The gambling regulation is un-
necessary ‘because oné person's
gambling neither infringes on
his fellow students’ rights, nor
disrupts the workings of the
community. Gambling is no
longer considered immoral and
it is illogical for students to
be duty-bound to prevent it.

Hazing is associated with fra-

ternity programs and should be
enforced by the IFC. The fact
that it is not enforced now de-
tracts from the enforcement of
the whole system of Honor and
Student Body Regulations.

It seems odd that we kept
these while repealing a drink-
ing rule which might have some

could possibily lead to excess

stricter enforcement by the Col-
lege.

The fact is, however, that the *

rule is repealed. We now have
a chance to show that we are
mature enough to handle our-
selves without it. We have been
saying for a long fime that we
can assurne responsibility with-
out ‘paternalistic’ rules. Let's
make the best of our chance.

RICHARDSON SCHOLAR

Foreign Student Relates
First American Christmas

By STEN LOFGREN
Richardson Scholar

This was the first Christmas
I had ever spent in a foreign
country—it was a very interest-
ing one and I do not think that
any country could have made
me feel more at home at Christ-
mas time than the U. S.

Of course the weather was a
serious set-back as far as Christ-
mas feelings are concerned—in
Sweden, where I come from,
snow is one of the most im-
portant ingredients in Christ-
mas.

All in all this has not been
what I think of as a traditional
Christmas—a Christmas spent
at home in my family. I spent
it with another of the Richard-
son Scholars, Juergen Ewald
from Germany.

We bought a car together.
(Have you seen a white ‘54 Pon-
tiac, probably slightly remind-
ing you of a graceful swan?

That's ours). We put more than
1,400 miles on that car during
the Christmas recess, and we
had no troubles.

Our first goal was Hunting-
ton, W. Va. The First Presby-
terian Church in Huntington had
organized an international house
for foreign students. It was all
free and very well organized,
you could come and leave when
you wanted. The whole thing
was a great success for the or-
ganizers—expecting 20-30 when.
they started, they received about
190 all in all during the holidays,
On our second day in Huntington
we met an American boy who
invited us to stay in his home,
and we did for three days, still
partaking in the program or-
ganized by the church.

One day we made a trip north
following the Ohio River and
visited Ravenswood, where we
had been invited by a friend of
mine, Bo Hartley. We stayed at

his home on Christmas Eve and
Christmas Day and had a great
time. When we left it was like
leaving a family of our own.

We then went to South Caro-
lina by way of Ohio, Kentucky
and Tennessee, going over the
Smokies at dawn. It was won-
derful to see the sun rise among
the mountain peaks. In South
Carolina we stayed in our room-
mates’ homes, I at Tom Craig's
outside Spartanburg and Juer-
gen at Woody Cleveland's in Co-
lumbia.

We both enjoyed ourselves
very much, and I am sure that
I speak for both of us when I
say that we now know what
American hospitality means,
that we made a lot of friends
during our trip and last, but by
no means least, that.we met
many charming Americans of a
kind that is all too scarce at
Davidson: Girls.

‘PLAYBOY’ POLL

Survey Finds Student Opposition To Johnson

While a large majority of U.
S. college students and their
faculty agree that President
Lyndon B. Johnson will be re-
elected to a second term, the
students favor a Republican can-
didate. according to a survey
conducted by Playboy Magazine
one week after the election of
John V. Lindsay as Mayor of
New York City.

The survey conducted on 2,000
campuses shows that a majority
of the students—55 per cent—
would vote for a Republican
candidate in 1968, yet 66 per
cent of the 200 faculty members
would prefer a Democratic can-
didate.

Despite their preference, how-
ever, 91 per cent of the students
agree that a Democratic can-
didate would win‘ the election.
Eighty-six per cent concede the
election to Mr. Johnson while

five per cent think Sen. Robert
Kennedy of New York might
win.

Among the faculty sample
polled, 95 per cent believe that
the Democratic party will again
be victorious, and only one per
cent of these belive it will be
someone other than Mr. John-
son.

The Playboy survey also ask-
ed “Since American males are
eligible for the draft at the age
of 18 and are serving their coun-
try, should the legal voting age
be lowered to 18 years in all
states?" Only 55 per cent of
both the students and faculty
agreed that this should become
law. The principal reason of-
fered by the survey’s respon-
dents against the lowering of the
voting age was that intellectual
maturity is more important
than physical maturity.

Of those students who chose
Republican candidates, 11 per
cent cast their ballots for Barry
Goldwater, 10 per cent for New
York Mayor-elect Lindsay, nine
per cent for Gov. William Scran-
ton of Pennsylvania. and the re-
mainder for Michigan Governor
George Romney, former Vice
President Richard M. Nixon,
Gov. Mark Hatfield of Orcgon,
and Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of
New York.

Among the students who pre-
fer the Democratic party in
1968, 29 per cent chose Mr.
Johnson as their favorite can-
didate; 12 per cent, Sen. Ken-
nedy; two per cent, Vice Presi-
dent Hubert H. Humphrey: and
one per cent, Gov. George Wal-
lace of Alabama.

Among faculty members who
prefer a Democratic candidate,

48 per cent selected Mr. John-
son as their favorite: nine per
cent, Mr. Humphrey: and six
per cent, Sen. Kennedy.

Nine per cent of the Republic-
an-criented faculty members
chose Gov. Romney; seven per
cent, Gov. Scranton; six per
cent, Goldwater; five per cent,
Nixon; four per cent, Lindsay;
one per cent, Gov. Hatfield: and
one per cent, Gov, Rockefeller.

Out of the nine per cent of
students who believe a Repub-
lican candidate might emerge
victorious, Governors Romney
and Scranton, Goldwater and
Lindsay—each are conceded a
five per cent chance. Two per
cent of the faculty thought Nixon
might be a winning candidate,
while one per cent said Gov.
Romney had a chance.

The survey determined that

76 per cent of the student re-
spondents will be eligible to vote
for the first time in the next
Presidential election and that 98
per cent of all those eligible
students say that they will vote
in 1968.

The survey is based on re-
sponses from a representative
sample of approximately 1000
students from all classes, ages
and backgrounds who serve as
& permanent ‘“‘sounding board"
on questions of current inter-
est. Another permanent panel
of 200 faculty members — one
representative of each campus,
comprising a wide variety of
educational fields — has been
polled. The survey also reflects
opinions from campuses on a
regional basis—in the East, Mid-
west, South, Southwest and
West.

SO DC GENTLEMEN DON’T BELIEVE they
should enforce a conduct rule they don’t accept—
does this surprise anyone? Throwing out the on-
campus drinking ban from the student body conduct
regulations makes the student’s position a little less
hypocritical, though perhaps still rather inconsistent.

Though a recurrent problem here, the social
consumption of alcohol in and around Davidson has
already been decided by the social customs of mid-
20th century American society. Give another decade
and even Davidson will have a tavern on Main Street
(and open bars in Charlotte). But with any major
social change, the transition process involves a diffi-
cult and often bitter period of hard feelings. So
here we are now.

There doubtless will be considerable sentiment
in the faculty and trustees for retaliation against
the students. Part of their anger comes from being
put in a bad political situation, part from feelings
of betrayal and frustration—part from sheer unwill-
ingness to see that student action (at least on this
issuc) is forcing the college, step by step, to recognize
certain facets of 20th century Americana.

I hope this retaliatory sentiment can be avoided
in favor of a gradual solution, best for all concerned.
Repealing what the faculty and trustees considered
concessions in the drinking rules, hiring extra guards
to make drunk-a-meter tests or search rooms and car
trunks, banning fraternity parties: these actions will
do little except increase ill-will and consequently
Very bad publicity for the school at a ertiical time.

___ Imagine how potential donors and large founda-
tion officials would consider a campus where a vir-
tual state of war exists between administration and
students, complete with frequent searches and ha-
rassment and resistance by the students, newspaper
headlines. I fear this more than I care about either
a wet or dry campus. ,

All parties involved must now make some moves
to save face. The move for the administration prob-
ably will be to announce in no uncertain words that
it will enforce with servere penalties the faculty
regulations—then to do nothing that isn’t already
done (except now handle cases themselves). Then
the best move for the students would be to accept
this situation quietly.

Why? Because this campus is-no more going
wet than, Hattie’s Cabin Tavern is going dry, as long
as the administration considers on-campus drinking
acrime. The student responsibility now is to keep
matters from getting out of hand and to accept any
reasonable faculty dicta on the situation.

Let the transition period be gradual, reaction-
aries and radicals hushed, and the results will be
conducive to all: the trustees and administration can
still claim the campus is dry, the students are not
responsible for enforcing unacceptable (and unen-
forcable) rules, and the entire matter will be kept
out of the newspapers.

EVER SLEPT THROUGH A REVIEW? The
Faculty Regulations state that permission to make it
up will be granted by the Dean of Students’ Office
only when the absence was due to circumstances be-
yond the student’s control. Sleep is not considered
an adequate excuse.

These regulations are enforced very haphaz-
ardly by the individual faculty members. I con-
ducted a spot poll of about fifty students with these
results: eight men, seven different professors in-
volved, took make-up reviews without. any consulta-
tion with the Dean’s Office; three students who had
missed reviews went through the Dean’s Office and
two of them were denied permission to retake the
review. All the absences involved were from sleep-
ing through the scheduled review period.

These regulations are there to protect the fac-
ulty members from student exploitation. There has
been some student resentment about these regs on
two counts: first, that once or so in a college career
a man might oversleep a review purely by accident;
second, that such men are unduly penalized by a
grade of zero.

In the first place remember that it is the stu-
dent’s responsibility and his alone to show up on
time for any scheduled hour test—to find out when
and where it is, make certain he is awake, and show
up on time. This responsibility cannot be ducked.

In the second place the faculty regulations do
not prescribe a specific penalty for missing a re-
view. A spot check of five professors (none of whom
were reported as not enforcing) showed unanimous
agreement that such an occurrence would not auto-
matically fail a student whose work was otherwise
acceptable. In most cases they indicated that the
grade would be affected by from half-a-letter to a
whole letter.

Practically speaking this is usually an equit-
able solution. But there are still some problems that
remain: haphazard enforcement and the fact that
some professors do record and average a zero in such
circumstances—a penalty too harsh for anyone ex-
cept a repeated diver. {

_Yet the matter of a grade for a course rests with
the individual professor anyway. And it would be a
bad precedent for the faculty to diétate (in effect) a
grade to a professor. But if all these cases were han-
dled through the Dean of Students’ Office, then it
might enable the Dean to be able to recommend
(unofficially of course) something more than a zero
for sleeping through a review in first-time, legiti-
mate cases.

PARKING FACILITIES is a very minor problem
here, contrary to popular opinion. There is room to
place all 400 or so cars somewhere within five min-
utes walking of any place on campus. But there is
not room to put 400 or so cars all at once in back of
Belk or by the library of in the fraternity court.
This is hardly surprising, since the campus is not a
shopping center.

It takes five minutes to walk anywhere on cam-
pus, no matter where one’s car is parked. By com-
parison at Carolina it can take twenty minutes to get
where one is going from where one parks.

There is no problem of adequate parking facili-
ties, but there is a problem of lazy students.
