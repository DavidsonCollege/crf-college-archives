The Davidsonian

Grapplers defeat Hampden-Sydney

~Cochran pleased with win —

Chris Cochran is a happy
man this week. The Wildcat
wrestling coach saw his grap-
plers demolish an outmanned
Hampden-Sydney squad, 48-
9 last Friday, and that is
enough to make any Davidson
wrestling fan happy. ‘There
were ten good individual mat-
ches,’’ Cochran said. ‘‘We
wrestled to the best of our

ability and didn’t let up. It

We considered printing an
infirmary edition of our col-
umn because of the sudden
rash of the Victorian flu, but
decided against it in hopes
that our healthy readers would
deliver our message to their
diseased colleagues.

The Basement Bangers de-
railed B.T. Express 38-10
Monday night in a game that
went down to the wire. The
Express ultimately yielded to
the relentless Bangers, but
only after Curt ‘“‘Mr. Oscar’
Goho drew two charges with a
superb job of acting.

The only other highlight for
the Express was that Ken
‘The Gerd’’ Norwood hit 80
percent of the team score—
eight points. Because of its
stellar performance we hereby
bestow upon B.T. Express our
Wimp Team of the Week
Award and congratulate them
on reaching the zenith of
basketball’s nadir.

The Gnads entered the gym
Sunday night with bloated
egos which were promptly
ruptured by the boisterous
bwanas of On Again. The
coffin of the Gnads was nailed
shut by the scoring tandem of
Dave ‘‘Love It’”’ Ellison and
Tom ‘‘Google’’ Cooper which
scored 34 points to match the
entire Gnads team effort. Fin-
al score: 51-34.

‘‘Weeter” Johnson once ag-
ain had an incredible game,
scoring 18 points to lead Der
Lix to a 44-38 flogging of
Martin Manor: Johnson was

awarded the game ball which
he promptly used to make a
batch of Spalding daiquiris
for the post-game wing-
ding. Jonathan ‘‘Rumrunner’”’
Rhyne pumped in 26 points for
the mugwumps of Martin
Manor.

Monday night, SPE #1 re-
duced the Average White
Team to the Sub-Average
Albino Alliance. The score
card for this game presented
an interesting predicament for
us.

The SPE #1 players were
listed by last name only, the
Average White Team mem-
bers by first name only, and
the scoring totals for each
player were left out. Thus, we
decided to credit all the points
to “‘Jumpin’ Joe’’ Clark of the
SPE’s, and Henry ‘‘Lofty’’
Lomax of AWT. The final
score was ‘Jumpin’ Joe’’ 38-
pgOLbYy. 21),

First Watts crushed a sub-
missive M&M team, 16-6.
Virginia “‘Rock-and-roll”’ Rob-
ertson paced First Wattettes
with six points, while Peg
“Tap-It-In” Travis added four
more. M&M was led by Susan
“Crusher’’ Casper, who laid in
four points. One fan was heard
to comment, ‘“‘M&M just
seemed to melt all over the
floor.”

We feel the time has come
for us to say ta-ta. We have
had an enjoyable career and
hope you have been pleased
with the column. We trust you
have lost a bit of your sanity
as well. May the next column-
ists bestow as much absurdity
upon you as we have.

vers from illness. Cochran
wrestled for three years at the
high school level, and helped
coach a Connecticut team to
the state championship while
attending college at Bridge-
port.

“‘Wrestling’s a super
sport,” Cochran commented.
“T love it. It does not attract a
lot of people, but you hope
you’re molding the proper
characteristics in athletes. It
boils down to just you out
there.”

When he assumed the top
position at Davidson, Cochran
knew that North Carolina was
not an easy state in which to
head a wrestling program. The
larger high schools in the state
have begun to emphasize the
sport only recently, and many
smaller schools have no wrest-
ling. The problem of recruiting
at Davidson is compounded
since no scholarships are of-
fered...

The coach admitted, ‘“‘A lot
of good wrestling takes place a
long distance from here. The
Ivy League attracts good
wrestlers. But I have four
good prospects who are defin-
itely interested in coming to
Davidson. They’re of all-state
caliber. With those prospects,
and the returnees we’ll have

COACH CHRIS COCHRAN knows that profuse sweat is

the key to wrestling success.

next year, the future here
looks good.”

If Friday’s match was an
indication of this.~s to come
for Davidson wrestling, the
future looks good indeed. The
Wildcats won seven of ten
matches by pins, and one by
forfeit. Hampden-Sydney won
the other two matches.

Leading the team victory
was Mark Scandling and Scott
Phillips. Scandling, who
wrestles in the 150.Ib. divi-
sion, remained undefeated in
dual competition this year and
raised his season’s record to
7-3. Phillips, now 8-2, scored
his fourth straight pin in the
177-lb. division.

According to Cochran,

(Irv Wilson)

Scandling and Phillips may
participate in the Southern
Conference tournament March
4-5 at East Carolina. Scand-
ling, the team captain, fini-
shed fourth in last year’s
tournament.

Other Davidson wrestlers
who won their matches ag-
ainst Hampden-Sydney were
Reb King, Terryl Rhye, Pat
Dulaney, Brian Jacobs, and
Steve Sellers. Ted Mumby
won by forfeit.

The Wildcat grapplers meet
Washington and Lee at 7 pm
tomorrow night at Johnston
Gym. The season concludes
next Friday when Davidson
hosts Furman.
