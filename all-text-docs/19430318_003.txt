PORTS
POTLIGHT

BY JIM JACKSON

As the days grow longer and balmier, the David-
son man grows lazier and soon the stadium will be
filled in the afternoon hours with sun bathers. And as
the annual clothes-shedding season approaches; the an-
nual problem on what to do on Sunday afternoon, when
it’s too much like spring to study and the outdoors
calls, approaches. There are many arguments, good
and bad, for and against, Sunday sports. It is an old
Davidson tradition, and a respected one, to observe the.
Sabbath by refraining from any athletics. Perhaps
this is the best policy. Perhaps it’s not.

More than ever before, the Davidson student finds him
self the victim of circumstances and contined to the campus
for the week-end, And when a free and ungoverned afternoon
rolls around it’s only natural for him ta seek “as pleasant a
diversion as possible from the drudgery of’classes and drill.
One-side—pives_thetolowing iisiverto the problem of Bhie
Law: If a person can gain the most complete and enjoyable
relaxation on Sunday Dy engaging in a good game of softball
or round of golf, well why uot let him play? While the
Seventh day is specitied as a day of rest, the type of rest is
not specified, “Phis tobe the view of -net—onlythe
majority of students, but the general trend in American life

sceenis

But there is another side to the question. The re-
spect and dignity of Davidson College must be pre-
served. There are many who believe that any partici-
pation in sports on the Sabbath is a degredation, how
ever slight they may be. They are well entitled to
their views, even though the views may be unappealing «
to those who they were designed to govern. The hope
remains that a happy medium will be reached, and
it must be reached soon.

FRAT TRACK

With the annual fraternity track meet scheduled
for the afternoons of next Wednesday and Thursday,
and the Betas reasonably assured of the cage crown,
the intramural cup race should become a pretty well
decided affair within the following few days. Should
the Betas come up with a winning combination, they
have to break even in softball and volleyball to wrest
the trophy from the defending Kappa Alphas. “The
leaders have a simple formula for victory. They simply
hang onto a bunch ‘of versatile veterans, ;while their

foes are constantly dropping dependable performers

DIAMOND TALE

Among the many tales of Connie Mack’s prowess
wisdom in guiding*his beloved Philadelphia Athletics is
of the tempermental hurler who insisted upon giving the water
bucket a punishing kick after each inning in which he failed
to give a top flight performance. These little incidents had
been going on long enough for the sure-footed slinger to de
Stroy three entire aluminum buckets. Fearing for the blow
to the -financial status of *his nonc-too-lucrative protegees,
Mack took matters in hand. Little was thought by the squad
when the. most recently battered container was replaced by
a shiny new one. And little was thought when the unfortu-
nate moundsman strode off the hill after failing to stem the
opposing tide, and planted a swift one Squarely into the pail.
But when he yelped in pain and anger and was found to have
sustained a broken toe, and the bucket showed not so-much as
a dent, they began to wonder. It was finally brought to light
that Connie had replaced the-regular-bucket with one of gal-
vanized iron. Hence a lesson in patience.and self control that
‘one baseballer won't forget. :

And tlien there’s the old fishinw story about the frog, the
moccasin and the bottle of spirits. One version goes that two
gentlemen of color were out in their rowboat on the mill pond
a summer afternoon and plying a lazy course across the lake.
Their Juck was none-too good and when one felt a meaningful
tug on his line he reeled in with glee onlyto—find—a—mere
frog engaged to the-barb. But the dreadful side-of the predica-
ment lay in the fact that a large and venomous water mocca
sin-hung-firmly-on-to-the dangling frog. Not wishing to get
within striking distance of the reptile and yet determined to
secure the frog, the unfortunate fisherman poured a few
precious drops of the sunshine water into the snake’sgaping
jaws, and it immediately let go. All proceeded in normal
fashion until the two were about ready to row in and call it
a day, when a breathless moccasin appeared at the side of the

boat, this time with a larger and more valuable frog:* That's
enough to quit on. :
