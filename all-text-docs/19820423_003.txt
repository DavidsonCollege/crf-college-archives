College Bowl
Season Ends

The College Bowl team returned
from last week’s National Champion-
ship Tournament at New York’s Roose-
velt Hotel with mixed feelings. They
lost to Vassar in the first round, 300—
130, but accomplished a great deal dur-
ing the course of this year’s competi-
tion. The team made it to the quarterfi-
nals of the National Tournament and
finished its season tied for Sth place in
the Country.

The team accomplished these feats
during their first year of intercolle egjate
play, an achievement coach Hansford
Epes called “extraordinary.” When
compared to Davidson’s traditionally
strong showing, this year’s record
seems disappointing, but Epes claims
that’s only because “we’re spoiled.”

On the basis of the final score, the
Vassar College Bowl team (ironically
enough composed of four male stu-
dents) routed Davidson. Coach Epes
felt his team played well, but that it was
simply Vassar’s game. “We didn’t lose,
they. won,” he said.

Epes praised the outstanding play of
Davidson team members Brad Mullis,
Marvin Overby, John Eglin, and Gor-
don Turnbull, who was selected to the
All-East team.

The youth of Davidson’s squad
bodes well for the future. Four team
members will return next year, and John
Eglin has two years remaining. The
team’s official season is over, but they
will continue to practice informally and

will give an exhibition match against the,

faculty team this spring. /

.. Ardvini has served as part time assist-
ant football coach for three years and
has assisted the Davidson wrestling pro-
gram for two years. He graduated from
Norwich University in. Vermont in
1977, where he earned All-East and All-
New England honors as a defensive
tackle.

Ardvini replaces Tom Miller as def-

ensive football coach and Bob Estock as
wrestling coach. Estock will take over
additional football duties and Miller re-
signed to coach at the Citadel.

“He (Ardvini) will make a valuable
addition to our staff,” said Farrell, “We
are delighted that he is with us full
time.”

Development

The pile of bricks taking shape behind
the Commons will not be just another
sidewalk; it will be a new dining terrace,
according to Food Service Director
Carlton Pritchard.

The terrace will provide “greater free-
dom in terms of food activity, program-
ming, and flexibility,” Pritchard said.
He plans to use the terrace for parties,
cookouts, and outdoor dining. Al-
though mud surrounds the terrace at the
moment, it should be “well landscaped”
by fall.

Construction of the brick porch began
on 30 March 1982, and Pritchard ex-
pects it to be completed by 15 May
1982. When the terrace is ready, says
Pritchard, the Commons will throw the
“biggest garden party in the world.”

Education Cuts
1982 Federal

- (CPS) — After more than a year of
haggling, Congress has finally ap-
_ proved a federal higher education
budget for fiscal 1982.

The House and Senate are just start-
ing committee work for the fiscal 1983

budget, which would fund programs

from October |, 1982 through Sept. 30,
1983.

Congress’ final budget for 1982 de-
votes about $5.5 million to postsecon-
dary education.

Though Bob Aaron of the American

- Council of Education called the final

budget “the first milestone for Congress
to block the president on education,” it
also represents an 18 percent cut from
the 1981 federal college budget.

Of the 30-some postsecondary pro-

grams administered by the federal go-

vernment, only one — a program to pro-
vide institutional funds for meeting dis-
cretionary “special needs” — enjoyed a
budget hike over 1981 levels. The in-
crease of 3.7 percent was considerably
below the inflation rate.

Aid to land-grant colleges under the

second Morrill Act was the only federal

program to get the same amount — $2.8
million — for 1982 as it got in 1981.
Two federal programs were not funded
at all.

The cuts, however, were far less
drastic than President Ronald Reagan
proposed in his 1982 budget proposal,
delivered February 1981.

Congress could not agree on the
Reagan proposals by the time the fiscal
1981 budget ran out in September. Leg-
islators passed an emergency budget to
keep federal‘ programs alive until they
could make a final decision on the
budget, which they finally did April 1,

1982.

In the meantime, of course, Presi-
dent Reagan had already made his prop-
osals for the 1983 fiscal year.

The President proposes ending 16 of
the 30 federal college proposals, and
cutting the total postsecondary educa-
tion budget to $4.5 billion, another 17

percent drop from the. 1982 budget Con-
_ Bress just approved. ;

Sports Budget

“We haven’t got’a finalized budget in
our hands yet,” says athletic director Ed
Farrell, “which isn’t unusual.” The

1982-83 athletic:'department budget'still -

awaits approval by the Trustees and
may not be final until fall.

Farrell says that his proposed budget
is “pretty much comparable’ to’ this
year’s,” but that it will include an

across-the-board slight increase to

ee

cover the cost of living.” Of this in-
crease to counter inflation, Farrell says,
“We looked at each item and more or
less increased the same amount.”

Physical education, intramural, and
women’s basketball budgets, which
were cut back this year, will be restored
to their former status. No funds are pro-
vided for the swimming team because it
has disbanded. Other men’s and wom-
en’s “rion-revenue” sports will receive
more money for recruiting.
