DR. LAFFERTY URGES
ALUMNI TO RETURN

Many things are happening at David-
son that are of interest not only to the
present student body, but also to every
one who knows the college and who has
a warm spot in his heart for the old
town. We would like for you to keep
in close touch with the college and the
happenings on the campus, and there is

no better way to do this than to subscribe Ww

for this paper, unless you visit the cam-
pus once a week. And speaking of visit-
ing the campus, is it not possible to visit
it at least once a year? Come this year
to Commencement and let us make it
the biggest Alumni Commencement in
the history of the college.

Are you not still loyal to the college?
Are you not interested in hearing of the
auccess in clean athletics and in the de-
hates with other colleges? Are you not
inte: in learning something of the
improvement and plans for bigger and
better things that are on foot? Take
Tra Davipsonran and come to Com-
mencement and you will be glad.

Don’t Knock, Boost!

Rost. H. Larreary,
Pres. Alumni Association.

ALUMNI REUNIONS.

The Class of 1914 will endeavor to
have a full reunion at Comencement. J.
R. McGregor and H. L. Fliot have sent
out the call to their classmates.

e ”

Dr. Lafferty, President of the Alumni
Association, writes as follows: “Why
do you not attend Commencement? Be-
cause so few of the fellows are back?
There would be none back if all did like
vou and said that. Get up a crowd of
vour classmates and chums and come
again and a room will be yours. Be;
cause there is nothing to interest me?
Come and make Something ‘he doing.’
Read at another nlace the Commence-
ment promram, and see if vou canot
came and help make it a great Com-
mencement.”

®

w “ite secretary and treasurer. This

bers. scattered all over Georgia. About

STORE AND DEPOT ROBBED.

On last Monday night Goodrum’s
store was broken into and several articles
were taken. The cash drawer was
broken into and a small amount was
found and taken. Several pairs of shoes,
a number of neckties, and several hats
were also removed.

On the same night the depot was also
entered, but nothing except two barrels
of flour seems to have been removed
from it.
