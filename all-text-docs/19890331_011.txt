Cats

beat UNC-A, but fall to

Winthrop and Wake in baseball

By JOE HOOVER ,

Davidson travelled to
Winthrop College on Tuesday
(March 14) for their first road trip
of 1989.only to drop an 8-5 deci-
sion. Winthrop scored four runs in
the first three innings. The Wild-
cats pulled within one on a solo
home run by Mikio Aoki in the
second, a triple by Mike
Liebdzinski followed by Ron
Krnacik’s sacrifice fly in the
third, and in the fourth, Ralph
Isernia led off with a base hit,
moving to second on Aoki’s
single. After two outs, Tim Kems
walked to load the bases. Mark
Weir was hit by a pitch, forcing in
Isernia, but the ‘Cats couldn’t
continue to capitalize as they left
the bases loaded when a pop fly
ended the inning.

Down 5-3 entering the eighth,
Davidson used four hits to score
two runs and tie the game. Isernia
got his second hit of the day, but
was retired on Steve Livesey’s
fielder’s choice. Joe Azzolino
followed with a base hit, and then
hampered by a leg injury, pinch
hit for Kerns, delivering a RBI-
» double. Weir single plated Az-
zolino but Jolin Woodall, running
for Holland, was thrown out
trying to score on ‘the play. ©

~” After entering in the seventh to
get the third out by registering a
strike out with the bases loaded,
‘Cats’ reliever Phil Magaldi was

touched for three runs on three —

hits in the eighth to absorb the

loss. Davidson was retired on.

’ three consecutive strikeouts in the
ninth to end the game. Aoki and
Isernia had two hits to lead the
Wildcat effort.

Davidson (4-3) pulled out the

big sticks the next day as they
collected twelve hits in routing
UNC-Asheville (4-12), 11-3.
Azzolino and Weir hit two home
runs apiece, all to the opposite
field, to lead the ‘Cat attack. The
Wildcats jumped on top from the
starton Azzolino’s three-run blast
in the first. Weir hit his first, a
two-run shot, in the fourth to give
Davidson a 5-0 lead.

The Wildcats exploded for five
more runs in the fifth. Aoki
Started a string of five consecutive
hits with a single. Azzolino and
Livesey followed with base hits to
load the bases. Aoki scored when
Bulldog pitcher Joel Perkins
balked before Weir unloaded his
second homer, a three-run blast.
George Halter followed with a
single to right, advanced on a
ground out and a. wild pitch, and
scored on Ron Kmacik’s sacrifice
fly. Not to be outdone by Weir,
Azzolino rocketed a solo bomb in

the sixth that smacked the score- .

board (some 400 feet from home
plate) in right field, a feat rarely
done at Wildcat Park. -

Meanwhile, starter David Wil-

liams was cruising with as three-
hitter until he ran out of gas in the
seventh. The Bulldog’s scored

on Brian Lancaster’s two-run,
opposite field homerJay Harris
and Brad Wanzenberg came on to
finish up. For the day, Azzolino

had three hits and four RBI’s, and.

Kmacik, Aoki, and Weir (5
RBI’s) chipped in two apiece.
Davidson fell to Wake Forest,
4-2, on Thursday. Chris Phillips,
Larry Colbourne, and Frank
Humber combined to one-hit the

“Cats, striking out six and walking ©

six. Davidson (4-4) starter Jeff
Loser and three relievers held the
Demon Deacons to only four hits,
but! they also walked six men,
three of which scored. The Wild-
cats scored first. In the second,
Joe Azzolino walked, stole sec-

[moved to third on a wild
pitch, and scored on the “Cats
only hit, a two-pout double by
Mark Weir. In the third, Wake
Forest (8-8), used two walks, two
stolen bases, an RBI base hit by
Warren Sawkiw and an error to
take a 2-1 lead.

In the fourth, Wake Forest’s
Jake Austin led off with a single
and stole second. Two walks
loaded the bases, .and Deron
Weston delivered an RBI sacri-
fice fly to score one run. The ninth
brought the Demon Deacons an-
other insurance run on a walk, a
stolen base, and an RBI single by
Mike DeFranco. The ‘Cats fin-

-ished the scoring in the bottom of

the ninth when Mike Holland
walked, was balked to second,
went to third on a passed ball, and
scored on Mikio Aoki’s sacrifice
fly.
