Davidson Students Show Great Love
for Their College---Exceed Quota by
‘10 Per Cent---Over $11,000 Raised

Report From Headquarters at Power House Heralds Campaign as Great
Success—Final Figures Expected to be Between $11,000 and $13,000

Davidson Solidly Behin

President

“That certainly was fine.”

At midnight, Monday, the 19th,
Davidson’s $10,000 gift.for David-
son was $11,025, with about 35 fel-
lows to be seen.

The results were rather slow ir
coming in, but all doubts about rais-
ing and exceeding the proposed
amount were dispelled when first
floor Watts turned in $1,135—her
quota was $433. This was the stir
floor in college, and no one group
even tried to keep up with these
bloated bond-holders of Watts. Only
two sections came under the expec-
tations, and all the rest were there
with the goods.

The power house was a very
popular resort from 9:30 to 12 the
night of the campaign, and second
floor Georgia vied with north wing
Chambers, third floor, in telling by
what amount their quota was ex-
ceeded. And after the excitement
had died down, someone started it

Million Dollar Campaign) First Game of the Season a Red and
Black Victory---Carolina Defeated
in Determined Contest, 31 to 20

' Progressing Nicely---
Indications Point

to Success

Winston-Salem Gives $50,000-—-Greens-| Outcome in Doubt During First Half—Tar Heels Outplayed in Second—
Carmichael and Roberts Stars

boro Pledges $100,000

The million dollar campaign wilt |
end on the first day of March, and it!

just has to go to the million mark,.
for if it doesn’t Davidson will lose
the $150,000 pledged upon that con-
dition.

With six weeks yet to run, a total
of $750,000 has been reached. Win-

been almost wholly raised up to Fri-
day night, and it brings the total up
to the three-quarters mark. But
this week, as Dr. Martin said in
chapel, is the most critical week in
the whole campaign. Davidson stu-
dents have a fund of $10,000 to raise,

and if they reach that goal it is al-j

most certain that Greensboro will
come acress with her pledge of
$100,000. Of course, Greensboro may
do it anyhow, but the pledging of
$10,000 by Davidson will help a good
deal.

Raleigh is now trying to add $50,-
000 to the fund, and if these two
cities do not disappoint us, it will
leave just $50,000 apiece for Wil-
mington and Charlotte to pive to
finish up the million. Davidson will
get the $400,000 from the campaign,
and the $150,000 pledged upon con-
dition that the million dollar mark
is reached, but it is hoped that this
will not end the generosity of Da-

_vidson’s supporters, and that much

more than the expected will be

given.

Des Moines Delegates De-
liver Delightful Dis-

'ston’s recent pledge of $50,000 had Men Speak on Various Phases of the

Made Upon Volunteers

The ¥. M. C. A. service last Sun-
day night was certainly a wonderful
‘one. It was ane strong testimony
that the World Volunteer Conven-
tion was worth while.
present was impressed with the
| Messages from this great confer-
ence, and the spirit in which the five
Davidson — representatives — pave
them.

Mauze first told. of their trip:to
Des Moines. Practically all of North
Carolina's delegates met at Ashe-
ville, where they boarded a special
train for the city of the convention.
He described the beauty of the rug-
ged and mountainous country which
they crossed in Kentucky, He told
of the beauty of the Ohio river as
they crossed it by night, of the silent
majesty of the Mississippi, and then
of the level plains of the Western
States. But soon they were at their

j destination, and thru the kind hospi-
itality of the citizens of Des Moines
were soon registered and reached
the immense coliseum in time for
the evening session. This great
building had a seating capacity of
10,000 and was filled at practically
every meeting, At the front of the
lower floor sat the delegates from

foreign countries, while behind them

and in the two balconies sat the dele-
gates from America. Mauze also
described the trip home, their stop
fora day in Chicago, and the beauti-
ful scenery which surrounded them
on their way home. To him the
watchword of the convention was
“Service,” and its message the great
need of the world for more foreign
Missionaries.

Schenck next told of what the
convention had meant to him. He
said it was the greatest privilege
that had ever entered his life. From
the very moment of the opening talk
by Dr. Mott a world spirit seemed
to fll the hall, and a clear call came
to unselfish service. Each delegate
was placed in a position to view the
needs of the world; the great dis-
tress of middle Europe, the ravages
of Armenia, the pagan millions of
Africa where Mohammedanism is
crumbling and the church faces one
of its greatest opportunities, the
urgent call of India and Japan, Over
half the world has never heard the
Gospel ; and this half is now groping

vention. Three meetings were held.

' Brice.

In the opening game of her 1920
basketball season, Davidson com-
pletely upset the dope by defeating
Carolina 31 to 20. The contest was
unusually hard fought and interest-
ing throughout.
The Carolina quint, which. had
been hailed as probably the best col-
lege team in the South, played good
basketball, but the fierce guarding
of the entire Davidson team, coupled
with the goal shooting of Roberts,
proved to be their undoing. Time
and again Carolina’s well nigh per-
fect passing system would be broken
up before a Tar Heet could come
within shooting distance of the goal.
Honors ‘were about evenly di-
vided in the first half, the Univer-
sity lads holding an 11 ta 9 lead at
‘the end of this period. In this half
they did their best playing, their
passing being of the finest ever seen
on the local court. :
The opening of the second -period
was not encouraging for the Da-
,vidson supporters. On the, initial
toss-up Carmichael got loose and
shot a basket in the first. 15 seconds
of play. This score was followed by
.three goals from fouls before the
, Red and Black succeeded in. caging
‘the ball a single time.

From this point on, however, the
old Davidson fighting spirit exerted
litself in away which brought de-
light to the heart of every Davidson
-min, The Tar Heel forwards were
completely smothered by the close
guarding of their opponents and
; were unable to throw another field
‘goal during the remainder of the
;Rame, while Roberts, Romefelt and
i Brice found the basket repeatedly.

The game was attended by an un-

usual number of injuries. Schenck
isuffered an injured knee during the
ifirst half which will probably keep
him out of the line-up for some time.
‘Drie, too, was forced to retire in
the latter part of the game, while
_Liipfert, star center for the Caro-
;linas, received a cut on the eve
which took him out of the game.

Liipfert and Carmichael were the
stars for Carolina, the latter throw-
ing 10.out of 13 tries from fouls.

The ‘entire Davidson team played
hard, fast basketball and deserves
great credit for its work. . Roberts,
-however, was the outstanding scorer
of the evening, making 17 of the 31
points credited to the Davidsonians.
