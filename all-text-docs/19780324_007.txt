Desire for success drives.new coach

By BARRY SACHTJEN
Sports Editor

When Eddie Biedenbach was
hired as the new head _ basket-
ball coach of the Davidson
Wildcats, he was faced with the
difficult task of taking over at
the end of a season. Assimila-
tion in an unfamiliar program
must be achieved quickly if the
culmination of the year’s re-
cruiting ‘effort is to be brought
to fruition.

Nevertheless, Biedenbach i,
determined to make the most
out of difficult circumstances:
He is unique in that he posses-
ses the rare combination of high
personal qualities, is essentia
in establishing a successful
rapport with players and others
connected with the program,
and an inexorable drive to work
to the limits of his capacities to
advance the program as far as
possible.

Biedenbach, a native of Pitts-
burgh, was an assistant coach
at N.C. State for eight years
after starring for the Wolfpack
at guard and playing in the
National Basketball Associa-
tion for a year.

He is noted particularly for
his strength in the recruiting
field, as he was cfedited “with
signing many top players for

Ruggers

By JOE CRAIG
Staff Writer

The Davidson College Rugby
Club opened its Spring ’
season as they squeaked by
feisty Red Springs, N.C. Clu
6-4.

Red Springs took the offen-
sive almost immediately upon
the opening kickoff, and quick
scored as the Davidson Ruggers
failed to take into account the
unusually short dimensions of
the pitch. Their conversion kick
attempt failed, making the
score 4-0.

However, Red Springs did

N.C. State. Although ieden-
bach hopes to have a good
recruiting year, he makes it
clear that success in this area
alone does not make for a gre~i
team.

“I’m not a coach to build up
recruiting. Although there is
always one guy who ¢an come in
and: make an impact, recruits
will be more important to the
future of the team. They are a
supplement to the present
team.”

Regardless of the fact that he
believes it is more than likely
that some incoming freshmen
could develop and play regular-
ly, ““working with guys that are
‘here is more important than all
year recruiting, since they are
the backbone of the team.’’
Biedenbach hopes to capitalize
on Davidson’s fine academic
reputation and prestigious
schedule to ‘‘recruit the top
student athletes in the country,
black or white.”’

In outlining a style of play for
next year’s team, Biedenbach
contends that the pattern of
play will be based on a team
concept—one that will be flex-
ible with the personnel and bes
use the natural abilities of th
players,’’ instead of relyin,

solely on one strict system. Th .

shot blocking are important and
that more emphasis should be

placed on ‘‘playing to win

Slaughter, all but three or four
of the lineg-outs.

Despite several excellent
scoring opportunities, the tena-
cious Red Springs team kept
Davidson from making any
tries, and so the Cats turned to
the toe of Steve Sechrest, who
calmly booted thirty-five and
twenty-five yard penalty kicks,
the latter coming from a nearly
impossible angle.

Davidson’s backs showed
much future promise as they
worked well as a unit, and
played good man-to-man cover-
age. New addition Stewart Bos+
well fit in well at weak-side
wing, and George Cornelson
and Wilborn Swaim shone, «
pecially on some pressure-re-
lieving punts.

The season certainly. looks to
be one of the most promising in
recent years, as a good turnout
of freshmen and sophomores
combined with the addition of
ex-football stars ‘‘moon-pie’’
Howell and Cliff Hester will add
much strength and ferocity.

Injuries have not yet been a
problem, except for a knee
injury sustained by Dave Mar-
tin late in the Red Springs
match. All the ruggers are pu
ling for his quick recovery.

Davidson’s next match is this
Saturday, March 25, against
Wake Forest University at 2
PM on the practice football
field. Everyone is urged to turn
out and see ‘‘the game for
gentlemen, played by mad-
men.”

your players constantly ad-
justing and doing whatever it
takes to win.”

Biedenbach added that suc-
cess in defense must come fror
conditioning, desire and effort.
He also feels that “‘games are
won on defensive and offensiv
intelligence.”

Biedenbach is an extremely
energetic individual, and is
often very hard to reach at this
time of the year since recruiting
must absorb a large portion of
his waking hours.

“IT believe a head coach has to
do a lot of recruiting, even if he
has great faith in his assistants.
Therefore, my travels will be
extensive at certain times of the

”

year.

Though swarmed with re-
cruiting assignments, the new
head coach is making plans for
next year simultaneously. ‘‘I
am very excited about the
prospects of working with the
present group of players, since I
will be counting on all of them
as the backbone of the team.”’

The prospects of settling
down in Davidson are also very
appealing to Biedenbach. He
feels that this ‘‘highly organized
community”’ offers a favorable
environment in which to live.

“At Davidson, we have the
best of both possible worlds.”’
One can reap the benefits of a
‘“‘small college town where ev-
erybody has an identity and a
good cultural area in Charlotte
v here any entertainment is

possible.” He mentioned that
his wife, Barbara and his two
young daughters were also ex-
cited about residing here.

Davidson will continue to
play a prominent national sche-
dule in future years accord-
ing to Biedenbach, who outlined
next year’s schedule. “Looking
at the power ratings, our sche-
dule might be, the toughest i:
the country. Eleven of next
year’s opponents were in: post
season play this year.”

Since he wants basketball to
be fun for his players Bieden-
bach hopes to arrange a Euro-
pean summer tour next year.
He believes this would be
possible considering the thrill i:
competing against top level
teams. Also, Biedenbach cit
the possible trip as an ‘‘educa-
tional experience which could
broaden the spectrum of both
players and coaches.”’

Biedenbach expressed delight
at the ‘attitudes of the David-
son students, faculty and alum-
ni in helping to get the program
on the way to where it deserves
to be.’’ Although he declined to
speculate on next year’s record,
“the program will be good next
year.”’

Bredenbach possesses a con-
cealed air of confidence that
surfaces when thoughts turn to
next year’s squad. “‘Next sea-
son, fans will enjoy themselves,
and will see a style of ball they
like the way thé game is
supposed to be played.”’

Golf team hopes to
repeat fall success

By MIKE KENNEDY
Staff Writer

After an intense 36 hole
qualifying round before winter
exams, the new spring golf
team was formed with little
variation from the fall.

During spring break six men
went South with coach Tim
Tallent to the Fripp Island
Tourney. Ball State led the field
while Davidson, led by Sollie
Foy’s 162, faired a disappo.
ting 12th in a field of 15. The
golfers later faced University of
Tennessee-Chattanooga and
suffered a narrow defeat, 8'%2-
6”.

Returning home, the golfers
headed over to the prestigious
Iron Duke Classic in Durham.
Davidson University (as Duke
unknowingly listed us) strug-
gled in to finish in a tie for 16th
with Michigan State, behind
powerful Oral Roberts Universi-
ty and North Carolina who
finished first and second respec-
tively.

The Cats had a most impres-
sive fall season with a record of

4 and 1 (including a defeat of
Duke) and third and fourth
place finished in the fall tourna-
ments. This strong fall perfor-
mance hopefully will serve as an
indication of future success on
the course.

Not only is there strong hope
for this spring, but also for the
coming years, as the team is
quite young. The squad in-
cludes six freshmen, one sopho-
more, five juniors and one
senior. With successful recruit-
ing, the team should continue to
improve year after year.

The Cats finish their season
with the Southern Conference
Tourney at the Country Club of
South Carolina. Top contenders
this year will be Marshall
Appalachian and Furman. Day
idson will get a good look at th:
top contender when they trav:
to Marshall for their invitation
al on March 31.

Based on past performance
and latent talent, hopes and
expectations run high for this
young and talented team for the
coming season.
