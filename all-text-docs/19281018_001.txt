FOR FRESH CLASS

Freshmen Not Allowed in Post

CAMPUSING, NEW PENALTY

Rule Regarding Freshmen Leav- |

ing Chapel After Upper-Class-
men Will be Strictly
Enforced

At a meeting of the Court of Control
recently it was shown that the freshmen
regulators will be more strict. New reg-
ulations were added to the fresh card and
rules were expressed more definitely.

Owing to the large crowds entering the
post office immediately after chapel in the
morning, the court saw fit to order the
freshmen to extend their time when they
should stay out of the office. The pre-
vious regulation read as follows: “Fresh-
men shall net enter post office after 8:10
a. m, until last bell for chapel at 8:35
a.m.” The time limits were changed by
the court to read 8:00 a. m. until 9:00
a.m. This, it is thought, will prevent the
congestion in the post office after chapel.

The judge of the Court of Control,
Raymond Lake, announced in chapel that
all freshmen should remain in their seats
until all upper-classmen had cleared the
room, This, he said, was just a word of
warning before action was taken by fhe
court. There is a rule on the fresh card
regarding this but the freshmen have not
adhered to it very well.

Two freshmen have received sentences
from the court thus far. One of
sentences led to the making of (severe)
rules concerning the wearing of a yellow
cap. The court has decreed that, when a
freshman is required to wear a yellow cap
campused. This cam-

CAPTAIN PRITCHETT

In the YL
conducted by local
Norton G. Pritchett,
athletic director of the college,
on the-life of the Apostle Paul,
he characterized as a great athlete.

By way of introduction Capt. Prit-
chett reconciled his position in gpeak-
ing religiously to a:group of men who
were apparently bent on the achieve-
ment of spiritual lives. He stated that
it would have been difficult for him to
have made such a talk if it were not
for one thought which had come to
him some ago, In coaching
track Capt. Pritchett said he did
expect to be able to vault as high as
the man whom he trained; to run as
fast as the sprinter he coached; or to
have the endurance of the long dis-
tance runner to whom he taught the
principles of athletic training. Capt.
Pritchett adopted this thought to his
position in speaking at the vespers.
He declared that he did not expect to
be able to attain the depth of spiritual!
life as some of those to whom he was
speaking.

Paul was one of the greatest men in

the assertion that Paul a great

and vivacity which would not allow

With the advent of the first issue of
the Chameleon, the campus critic
again makes his annual debut. In the
opinion of the reviewer this first issue,

As stated by McQueen in his edi-
torial, the present staff has not sought
to make any radical changes in the
general policy of the Chameleon, but
will follow the general policies of the
past staff. On the other hand, the
numbers presented in this first issue
display, with the exception of Boggess’
“This Violin,” published in last year’s
first issue, a superior talent and ability
to the
magazine.

In the field of fiction “The Star of
Death” has rightly been chosen to be
the first number of this issue. Me-
Cutchan was wise enough to limit his
field of writing to one with which he
was thoroughly familiar, which state-
ment may not be made so justifiably
of the author of “Jungle Fever.” In-
deed the “Star of Death” shows the
author to, possess a more complete
knowledge of his subject matter than
he possesses ability to sustain the ac-
