Students learn from
master pianist, Taub

By JENNIFER CARLSON
Guest Writer

Thursday evening, November
7, Robert Taub gave an electrify-
ing performance of two Beethoven
Sonatas, Opus 31, No.2 in D Minor
(Tempest ) and Opus 106 in B-flat
Major (Hammerklavier), to a ca-
pacity crowd in Hodson Hall. Fri-
day, I, along with four other
Davidson students, had the privi-
lege of performing in the Master
Class taught by this internation-
ally-acclaimed pianist.

While waiting for Taub to
commence the Sonata in D minor,
I took some time to peruse the
biographical information printed
in the program. “Institute for Ad-
vanced Study’s Artist-in-Resi-

dence since 1994,” “recipient of
the highest award for piano at the
Julliard School,” “performed with
symphonies in San Francisco,
Montreal, Hong Kong. ...,” the list
goes on. Reading about his
achievements made my heart skip
a beat for two reasons.

First, I knew I was about to
hear an incredible performance.
Second, in the back of my mind I
knew that in less than 24 hours, I
would be publicly critiqued and
coached by this virtuoso pianist.
In short, I was rather intimidated.
However, once Taub entered on
stage, my initial nervousness re-
sided. Taub, though an interna-
tionally-acclaimed leader, remains
modest and personable. He en-
lightened the entire audience with

a brief word about each sonata
before attacking the ivories. (We
all got a good laugh, for example,
from his tale on the title
“Hammerklavier,” which actually
means no more than “Sonata for
the Piano” and resulted from
Beethoven’s misunderstanding of
an Italian title.) Yet, once Robert
Taub. sat down at the Steinway
Concert Grand Piano, the mood
changed from that of light humor
to pure amazement.

With his superb technique, the
pianist highlighted every note, so
that each finger produced a differ-
ent dynamic quality. He got our
blood pumping during the fast-
tempoed Allegro and Scherzo
movements of the Hammerklavier
while holding us captive during
the slower Largo movement. In
all, the performance was indeed
that of a virtuoso pianist, an in-
credible leader in his field. The
Master Class further attested to
Taub’s unpretentious attitude and
technical superiority. Taub al-
lowed each student to play his or

. her piece, making mental notes of

passages that needed attention.
Then he focused on a particular
passage or measure, asking the stu-
dent to repeat it following his per-
sonal advice on dynamics, meter,
and tempo.

At no time was Taub conde-
scending. Rather, he was encour-

- aging, as he made various sugges-

tions, for example, on finger pat-
terns and rhythm. He also asked
the students specific questions on
their playirig, reminding them of
the importance of thoroughly
knowing and understanding the
elements of their pieces. By the
end of the class, the students and
public audience alike had a much
better appreciation of the diligence
required to become a master pia-
nist like Taub. For me, it was truly
an honor'to be one of his students.

Taub is in the process of re-
cording the complete Beethoven
Sonata Cycle. Volumes One and
Two are currently available on
VOX classics. They can be pur-
chased from the Friends of the Arts
at Davidson, who deserve many
warm thanks for bringing Taub to
Davidson for the second year in a
row. Keep your eyes open for all
related Friends of the Arts events.
