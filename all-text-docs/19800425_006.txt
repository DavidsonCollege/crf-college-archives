Dr. Daniel Gaj , Winner
of the 1976 Nobel Prize for
Medicine, will visit Davidson
April 28-29 as the 1980 Rey-
nolds Lecturer. Although most

Gajdusek’s work is among
the most unusual medical re-
search in recent years. His
prize-winning project began in
1953 when he visited New
Guinea, the home of the most
primitive Aboriginal tribes in
the world. These tribes inhabi-
ted the valleys in the central
‘highlands of the island and, at
the time of Gajdusek’s visit,
in virtual Stone Age condi-
tions. In one tribe, a mysterious
populations with noticeable
regularity. A public health offi-
cial, Dr. Vincent Zigas, had
reported the disease to local
authorities, but did not receive
much attention. When Gaj-
dusek heard about the disease,
he was intrigued and decided to
stay in New Guinea, hoping to
study the disease.

The disease is called kuru in
the tribal language, which
means ‘‘trembling,’’ the first
noticeable symptom. As Zigas
had noticed, it was a fatal brain
disorder predominant among
women and children. It seemed
to follow family patterns, but
otherwise occurred without ap-
parent cause or cure. With little
more than this to go on,
Gajdusek moved in with the
natives, sharing their culture
and lifestyle for 10 months.

He made extensive journeys
into the surrounding highlands,
mapping the geographical dis-
tribution of kuru, and buying
bodies of victims from tribal
members with axes and tobac-
co. After extensive research, his
results were inconclusive, but
interest had been drawn to his
work, and similarities between
kuru and certain animal disea-
ses were found. The common
factor was the long period of
time that passed. between in-
fection and noticeable-symp-
toms of the disease: anywhere
from five to twenty years.

Gajdusek continued his work,
transplanting brain tissue from
human victims into chimpan-
zees, with the same lethal
with similar diseases, Gajdusek
was able to prove a current
theory that human degenerative
diseases could be caused by
‘‘slow-acting viruses’’ which
might not become active for
years. In the case of kuru, the
viruses were from
the brain cells of the victims to
their surviving families, who
ate the brains in a funerary

The implications of kuru re-
search are important, for they
provide new information on the
nature of multiple sclerosis,

Parkinson’s--Disease, Hunting-
ton’s Disease and other related
diseases that can strike people
after years of perfect health.

Richard Marsh, Department
of Veterinary Sciences, Univer-
sity of Wisconsin, proaised
Gajdusek and his Nobel Prize
saying, ‘Waiting for long in-
cubation periods and experi-
ments that never seem to end

| will be a little more tolerable
now, thanks to the honor be-
stowed on a unique individual.”

Gajdusek’s knowledge in
areas other than medicine
played an integral part in his
work on kuru. His lectures,
“The Philosophy of Medical
Research in Isolated, Pre-
literate Societies,”’ on Monday
and ‘‘The Discovery of Slow
Viruses and Its Implications for
Medical Research” on Tuesday
should reflect his wide-ranging
interests.

Both lectures will be given in
the 900 Room at 7:30 p.m. each
evening. Informal conversation
with Gajdusek will be held at
10:00 a.m. each day in Cham-
bers Gallery.

Berkeley group gives Reagan its sarcastic support

(CPS)—A presidentijal candi-
date, Ronald Reagan, who has
fared poorly in student-dom-
inated precincts during the
primaries, has unwittingly ral-
lied some dubious support on
the University of California-
Berkeley campus.

Calling itself the ‘‘Reagan for
Shah Committee,” a group of
allegedly pro-Reagan activists

has announced its plans to
protest the “‘ugly emergence of
neo-anti-war hysteria on Amer-
ica’s campuses.”

Zodiac News Service reports
that committee members claim
‘thousands of clean, decent,
obedent Americans’’ support
them. The committee plans
university rallies to protest the
‘disturbing specter of draft

resistance hanging over our
universities and colleges.”’

Organized support for the
committee’s efforts is said to
come from such ‘groups as the
“John Wayne Peace Institute,”
‘‘Mutants for a Radioactive
Environment,’ ‘‘Berkeley Stu-
dents for War,” ‘‘The National
Grenade Owners Association,”
among others.

The world can be big
and bad for some. For others it
looks much easier. Survival
means different things to
different people. Is it luck or
preparation?

Preparation seems
to be the key. Consider the

pevelop in Army ROTC. The

big, bad world of tough job
competition.

You may bea

not too late to add Army
ROTC. And add experience to

your degree. Contact
