New Perspectives

This is the first issue of the new editorial “we.”
With any new editorship there is naturally a new edi-
torial policy, new perspectives and ideas, new em-
phases and concerns. We are no different.

While we have only praise for our immediate
successor, we do not plan to continue editing and pro-
ducing THE DAVIDSONIAN without some changes in
direction and purpose. A college campus needs a dy-
namic newspaper, capable and flexible enough to re-

nd to changing needs. For the past year THE DA-

SONIAN has served Davidson College well, and_it
is our goal to continue to function well in the role
of the campus newspaper.

There have been moments in the past when the
contributions of THE DAVIDSONIAN have been
empty. At such times the newspaper has lost sight
of its purpose and has “copped-out’” on its responsibil-
ities to the college and its students. And there have
been moments when the student newspaper has been
ignored and rejected because it has attempted to main-
tain its journalistic integrity in the face of irrational-
ity and selfish desires. In both cases the real loser
has been education at Davidson.

In the end, the newspaper’s foremost priority
should be the improvement of the educational en-
vironment at Davidson. Education, of course, encom-
passes much more than the mere classroom ex-
perience. It includes all of the learning encounters
and activities that the student undertakes. Thus, it is
our goal to support whatever elements of the ‘“Da-
vidson experience’’ seem to us to be beneficial to the
educational process of the college and to criticize any
facet of Davidson which we deem detrimental to true
learning. :

In short, we wish ‘to be an active force in the
improvement of education at Davidson College. And
we will do everything in our editorial and journalistic
power to accomplish this end.

No Vote Of Confidence

‘Davidson students ought to be able to expect
more effective action by their student government
than they were given in the recent and continuing
SGA elections.

The elections board, whether suffering from
laziness, ineptitude, or a combination of both, should
be censured for its failure to provide the students with
a’secure elections procedure.

First, the elections board did not properly insure
the integrity of the run-off elections for SGA vice
president. Although it is their choice whether or not
to keep records of students voting in such races, the
board’s refusal to keep* records makes it responsible

for the doubts now being cast about the validity of ”

the results.

Second, the board failed to keep secure the rolls
of the candidates who filed for election to the senate.
These files were left for hours lying Joose in the halls.
of Duke dorm with no provision to ensure that they
were left alone.

The election board has blamed the loss of these
files on “shithead’”’ thieves (whatever they are), but
few students are convinced that carelessness was
not the true cause of the mishap.

Finally, the board has failed to protect the integrity
of its powers frém encroachment by the outgoing SGA
president. Coble, now in a lame duck capacity, had
claimed that he would not hold another vote in the dis-
puted runoff elections unless provided with certain

_ Specific proof of irregularities.
To be sure such proof should be a prerequisite
for renewing vote taking, but in actuality the decision
‘ about such matters rests with the elections board and

the senate. We feel the senate properly and wisely ex-
_ ercised its power by calling for new elections.

In short, the elections board did not provide the
student with quality of service they have a right
tpexpect, We would like to urge the new administra-

on .

g chosen to see that such inefficiency is .
immediately extirpated from its midst. y

‘Student Power’ Can Come

Through Student Sacrifice

“Student Power’: is two
words that greatly frighten
many people both within and
without the academic com-
munity.

Usually hearing those
words stimulates a mental
picture of long-haired rock
throwers assaulting a line of
policemen, of ‘‘liberating’’
dean's offices and of braless
coeds taunting the pigs.

But all of these pheno-

‘mena, although they have

been associated with student
power in the sixties, in fact
represent the frustration
rather than the expression

Sw of true student power.

Columbia University’s
closure last year is a good
example of this. There ad-
ministrajors simply ignored
the students’ demands, legi-
timate or not, until the stu-
dents went beyond student
power to exercise what
might be. called ‘' le
power’’ — the. ability of \any
group of sufficiently angry
persons to express them-
selves through mass _ vio-
lence.

There is no quality
about ‘mass violence that
is peculiar to its use
by students. It only  oc-

curs more f ntly in stu-
dent ie koh stu-
dents are among the groups
most often denied - expres-
sion through their legitimate

channel, student power.
legitimate

This channel

vs
ANDERSON
is usually not a student gov-
ernment orginzation. Here
at Davidson, for instance,
the past several SGA pre-
sidents have possessed some
real power (defining that
term in its usual sense, as
the ability to’ bring other
persons to do what the exer-
ciser of power wants them
to, in its weaker manifesta-

tions « often called “‘influ-
ence’’).

.But the power that Ran
‘Coble has wielded, or that
which Danny Clodfelter will
wield, should not be confus-
ed with student power.
Rather it is what Max Weber
called ‘‘charismatic authori-
ty,"’ the power which ac-
crues to a man because of
the force of his personality.

It is true that in their
slight power is an admixture
of institutional authority,
since Davidson's true _insti-
tutional authorities (for those
of you who haven't figured
it out yet, the trustees, ad-
ministration and faculty)
permit the SGA to exercise
some minor portion of their
institutional power.

This power is, however, by
no means inherent in the

office. Instead it is a free

gift which can be revoked
and probably would have
been, if Cecil Burney had
been elected in Clodfelter’s
place.

That the SGA president
has only charismatic author-
ity is shown by the fact that
other students hold as much
or more power without hav-
ing been elected to anything;
Jimmy Trussell is a good
example.

(Admittedly such power
has characterized the SGA
presidency in the past few
years, but this is solely due
to the Davidson condition
that it has become neces-

- sary to be charismatic to

win that office.

That condition is of late
origin, for it has existed
only since the term of Tom
Earnhardt in 1967-68..It does
not necessarily apply to any
other campus offices, where
other considerations or none
at ‘all may apply.

df an uncharismatic indi-
vidual ever becomes piesi-
dent (on the basis of the
fraternity ‘issue, or some
other overriding concern),
this condition will no longer
hold. ‘

The above constitutes sev-
eral negative definitions of
student power. But if the
thing actually exists, it
must have spositive quali-
ties.

One positive
student power is that the
things it affects must be re-
levant to being of the stu-
dents. g

Vietnam, for instance, is
only ‘slightly relevant to stu-
dents, in that students are
cadet members of the na-
tional leadership elite. But
that is only a minor part of
being a student, and many
are at best only marginally
involved,

What is extfemely rele-

vant to all students is their .

school. This is the true arena
for the exercise of student

Copy Editor

“Here I am today, stoop-
shouldered and weary, with
the nasty burden of Wisdom
on my back.”’

In_this manner, the anony-
mous author of ‘Confessions

-of—an-American Scholar,”

writing under the pem name
of Simon O'Toole, opens his
account of his  falling-out
with the U. S. educational
establishment.

O'Toole is, according to
his publisher, ‘‘a well-known
scholar in his field, which
he had described as a small
pasture about eight feet by
twelve."’

In his ‘account, O'Toole re-
lates events from. his long
experience in higher educa-
tion in order to show that
colleges do not educate.

O'Toole. has gone through
all the necessary require-
ments to achieve’ the rank

quality of

power, and at all. schools
it has always existed. Only
the students’ failure to re-
cognize it has prevented its:
use in the past.

Another positive quality
is that student power be-
longs not to individuels but
to the entire student popula-
tion. As a result it can be
exercised only in the mass.

Elected individuals cannot
exercise student power un-
less they are recognized by
all to embody it through the
formality of their election
(and in the present circum-
stances it is difficult to con-
ceive of any Davidson facul-
ty or administrators being
able to treat elected stu-
dents as embodying student
power. The tradition of sole-
ly charismatic influence,
mixed with the free gift, is
too long and too general).

For imstance, do you wart
to end the grading system
by means of student power?
Grades are certainly relev-
ant to students.

Get two hundred _hard-
core opponents of the grad-
ing system, and if the facul-
ty is unwilling to recognize
their power to change the
system, then let them flunk.

; %

Let them miss all reviews
and use campus communi-
cations fo let the faculty
know why they are missing.
And the larger the number
of students involved, the
greater is the effect. Even:
tually’ grades will be Irrele- —
vant, even if they are not
immediately abolished,

Obviously this method in-
volves sacrifice, Bit so does
all use of power that is tin-
recognized by other holders.

The trick is to achieve

‘ that recognition; then it is

‘possible to’ institutionalize
the power, in this country
_usually by elections. Until
the power is recognized,
though, all the elections to
any post are meaningless.

‘O'Toole’ Hits Scholars

of ‘\American -Scholar.’’ As
his publisher declares, ‘‘the
number of his publications
has made many of his col-
leagues nervous."

O'Toole is extremely cri-
tical of the American _uni-
versity professor. | ‘‘Some
where there must be an
American Scholar who act-
ually wanted to be an
American Scholar.’’ But, as
(O'Toole continues wryly,
“did he have a genuine, ado-
lescent longing to write foot-
notes?”’

O'Toole is especially cri-
tical of the Scholar’s own
estimation of the worth of
his field. ‘‘How proud we
were whenever a_ student
switched his major~ from
physics to English. We had
saved him for Humanity.”

In _ conclusion, O'Toole
States that American educa-
tion leads to ignoranee be-
cause all anybody learns is

_ footnoting, not substance.
