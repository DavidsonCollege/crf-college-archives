Nano, nano. As we head into
the final seven weeks of winter
term we must put away our
bongs, Buds, whips and chains,
and once again focus on our
academic pursuits which inevi-
tably will lead to great wealth
and narrow-mindedness.

In keeping in line with this,
we will fashion our valedictory
article after the old Roman
format, debate. This week's
point-counterpoint is on Woody
Hayes. ,-

Bonehead—PRO: ‘Bernard,
you pompous overbearing fool.
Woody Hayes had ‘every right
and reason to punch that arro-
gant high-paid nen-student
athlete into the ozostrato-
sphere.

“I pat Woody on the back for
making his symbolic gesture
against the big-time commer-
cialized sports that have no
purpose on our small college

; campuses. I admire Woody for.
standing up for his rights, his

lefts, his combinations, and_his.

' “For years it has been consi-
dered the American way for the
individual ‘to pull his own
weight, and by damn, Woody
just said to himself, ‘Self, if
nobody else will tackle that
Sey thea T wilt just pound Kio
face in.’
“And Bernie, I believe that
, good violence is just as Ameri-
cam as hot dogs, Chevrolets,
and Hi-Liters. And finally, that
young man, being from Clem-
son,. was probebly a redneck
and drove the head tractor in
the Clemson Christmas jubilee
parade.
*‘Woody’s punch probably
straightened him out,. and

wer Waady: Hepes, my kind of

man and my choice for Coach of
the Year.”

Bernard—CON: ‘“‘Bonehead,
how can you possibly be so
feeble minded and vacuous?
Your reasoning sounds more
like that of a fifth grader than
that of the overpaid imbecile

“It was obvious to the mil-
lions of television viewers ac-
ross this great. country that the
punch Woody. Hayes threw was
not even a good one. What I ask
is why all this fuss over a punch
that would not even get a
comment from Howard Cosell in
a Spinks-Ali fight.

done something truly sensa-'

tional and dramatic like grab-
bing the yardmarker stake and
driving it through the young
man’s chest, causing immediate
death, then I could see your
claim that Hayes should be
named Coach of the Year.

“It was clear that his punch
no longer contained that awe-
some force that it once posses-
sed in that long, lost and
forgotten golden era when he
punched numerous players, stu-
dents, and fans. With all the
brilliant young fighters in Ame-
rica today, it just seems fair
that Hayes should be fired, and

someone else given a chance to .

well that’s just too bad. For a

rooms. Now on with the news.
Our number one team before

. Christmas, the SAE’s plus one,

continue to hold that spot. They
downed the Tools, 68-45, be-
hind Adrian Wilson’s 22 points.
Dwight Anderson Petrou had
15 for the losers. The SAE’s
added 6’5’’ Carter Todd to their
.roster, and this might be helpful
once Tim Goodell has to leave

- for baseball.

The second spot is still held
by. Bye. Dave Jones and com-
pany wasted Van Halen, 77-32,
and Rodger Hodge was high

man. with 22. The Excitable

_Boys edged the Bonecrushers

than it should have been. The

ties of hustle.

In a game involving two top
ten teams, the Hole edged Cool
Breeze behind the superior play
of Viest, Strader and‘Ford.
McLain and Hanna played well
in a losing effort. The Hole also
nipped the Bonecrushers, 53-46,
earlier in the week.

Wagon Ho claimed a pair of —

victories during the week, rol-
ling by the Surrogate Mothers,
57-52, and edging Hurtin for
Certain, 47-46 in OT. Rob

“tri-sexual’’ Perz had 18 for the

Mothers, and Minor Sinclair 19
for the boys on the bandwagon.
Artie Merten paced Hurtin for
Certain past the Five Easy
Pieces, 40-36. Merten had 12,

and nobody played for crap for
the Pieces

The Tuts proved they were
overrated as they- dropped con-
secutive games to the Surrogate
Mothers and Five Easy Pieces.

Stockton, Beck and Pollock all.

had double figures in those
games.

In the B League jit appears
that B.J.U. and Old and In the
Way are the teams to beat. Mr.
Sex and the Shankers might
come around by tourney time if
Team captain, Parks Neisler,

would spend as much time in :

the gym as he does at the Press
Box in Charlotte.
