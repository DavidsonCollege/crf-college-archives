‘In this the last issue of THs Daviv-
SONIAN before the new Staff takes
charge, we, the old Staff, bid you, the
Reader, farewell.

Who can say that it is absolutely
wicked to pitch horseshoes on Sunday, or
that he who does so stands a slim chance
of getting into Heaven? But as this is
the day of “preparedness” and ‘“‘safety
first,” let’s be on the safe side and cut
it out. At any rate, we have noticed
that very few gentlemen indulge in the
sport on Sunday.

Go out to the Athletic Field any aft-
ernoon, and you will see the benches
lined with admirers and  applauders.
And let the team go off and there will
be a big crowd at the train to give them
a yell and a good send off. But there
are two teams on the Hill, the Debating
teams, that are working every bit as hard
as any baseball player, and yet it is a
rare occurrence for anyone tu give them
a word of encouragement, and it is hard
to work without an occasional pat on
the back. Then, too, the Debating teams
serve the college fully as much, in pro-
portion to the men composing them, ar
any athletic team. This is due to lack
of interest in debating, which might be
revived by having a debate on the Hill.
But whether this is done or not, the next
time you run across a debater, put your
hand on his shoulder and wish him good

uck.

Last year a man, who improved and
made a success of everything he went
into, suggested a plan for making the
Magazine a real success, a thing of in-
terest to all the students, and for , put-
ting it into the place it should be in stu-
dent life. This plan was to put it en-
tirely in charge of the Junior class, much
as the Annual is in charge of the Senior
class, It is a fact known to Seniors that
Juniors work harder on a thing like that
than a last year man would, for the sim-
ple reason that Juniors have a record te
make and live thru the last year, where-
as the Senior, knowing it is his last year.
cares little what anyone thinks or what
happens. And more than that, the Jun-
iors would feel the responsibility of get-
ting out a good magazine. We think thi-
a good idea. Could not the present
Magazine Staff work out the -plan jin
detail ?

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN. March 21, 1917

Why is it that every North Carolina
laily newspaper has in it an article abou
Wake Forest, Trinity and two or threc
other colleges in the State, but an article
ibout Davidson is rarely seen. David-
‘on’s name should be seen in the papers
not to advertise for more students—
Davidson has as many as she can handle
now—but to keep her, her doings, her
superiority, before the minds of the pub-
lic. Surely if other colleges can do it,
she can, and she can go one better. Onc
man might be selected by each State and
County club, who, before THe Davin
SONIAN goes to press, could gather suffi-
cient news to write articles to their home
papers, that the papers would be glad
to publish, especially if they were in-
sculated with news of students from that
community. Since these men would be
paid for their work, it would not become
uninteresting. And the several men
might form a club, the Quill Club,
which would serve to keep up pep.

‘There have been many hypotheses ad-
vanced and explanations offered to show
why the Student Council has seemed
weak and unable to cope with the prob-
lems of discipline that have arisen. We
propose the following: ‘There is at
present, sad to relate, no punishment
between a simple warning, or pytting a
iman on probation, and suspension. ‘There
should be, for there lies all the trouble.
When a Fresheman jibes, no one will
report him, lest he be suspended, or
nothing done to him at all. And should
he be reported, there is no representative
body of students that will vote to sus-
pend a man for so minor an offence. The
same thing holds true when a witness
shows "contempt of Council” by refus-
ing to witness. No one would vote to
dismiss him from college, and a warn-
ing would be meaningless. We con-
tend that if we can get some penalty to
fit our laws, it would be better than
changing our laws to fit our penalties.
This punishment has been tried at a
college considerably larger than David-
son, and it has proved a practical suc-
cess, Hazing is prohibited. From the
Student Council there is chosen by lot
for cach punishment, men who will take
the offender, whether Freshman who ha
shown himself too “fresh” or has pro-
voked hazing, or upper-classman who
has committed a minor offence, and give
him an official thrashing, varying ir
severity. This would be more leagalized
hazing than hanging a man in court i
legalized murder. We do not claim this
to be an ideal punishment or solution,
but it is a step in the direction.

MOVING PICTURES TO BE
SHOWN FRIDAY NIGHT

Thru the courtesy of the National
Pipe Co., of Pittsburg, on Friday even.
ing in Shearer Hall three films of pic-
tures will be presented. These film
show the processes in the stages of pro-
duction of iron pipe. The company ex
pects to send a representative to explair
the pictures. Also, probably there wil’
be shown the two reels that have severa
times heen gotten from the Bureau o
Commercial Economics.

The Committee on Public Lecture:
announces that these will probably bx
the last pictures that will be shown thi
session under the same auspices. Thes.
two features will be very instructive
The public is cordially invited. As usua
no admission will be charged.

As the paper goes to press, bids are be-
‘ng opened for the second time for th
contract of the new gymnasium. It i
expected that the contract will be le
this week and work will begin as soon a
material can be assembled on thr
grounds. Dr. Martin has a cut of th
olans ready for THE DavipsoniaNn, an*
this will be printed along with furthe:
details as soon as definite plans have
been completed.
