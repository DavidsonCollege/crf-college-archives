ROTC Draws Blood

The Mecklenburg County Red
Cross last week awarded a plaque to the
Davidson Scabbard & Blade ROTC ho-
nor society for “collecting the largest
number of pints for this size of enroll-
ment,” during their blood drive held on
2 November 1982 according to Brad
McCall who ran the drive.

Davidson came first in a Red Cross
contest among eleven Mecklenburg
County Colleges including Pfeiffer,
UNCC and Queens.

The drive netted 296 pints from 342

people.

Snowed in but few problems

By TIM MCGAUGHEY ’85

Davidson, North Carolina received
1.5 inches of snow and ice on Friday,
January 21.

The snow, which later turned to
freezing rain, coated the campus with a
crust of ice.

Damages in the town and around the

campus were modest. No power out-
ages occured and there was no property
damage. The Grounds Crew removed
snow, swept pathways to prevent acci-
dents, and cleaned up a couple of fallen
tree limbs.

In the town of Davidson there were
few problems. A pair of fender benders
occured Friday and Saturday with little
jamage to any party.

No Midwinters Concert

By JEFFREY MANN ’84

There will be no concert at this year’s
Mid-Winters Big Weekend for the first
time in recent memory. Brice Street, a
local rock band, will play in the 900
Room Saturday night with no cover
charge.

Union Concert Committee Chair-
man Jim Hoskins said the Committee
had decided on booking Warren Zevon,
but “it fell through at the last minute.”
Hoskins said “There was also some hes-
itation on spending as much money as
he wanted.”

Union Director C. Shaw Smith,
who dealt with the agent, said, “We
piddled around a little bit, but the way I
understand it, we never had a date. I

304 Books Lost

The Davidson College Library
found 304 books missing in this year’s
inventory according to Library Director
Leland Parks, in a memo addressed to
the “College family.” This figure is up
from 267 last year, and 248 the year be-
fore.

Parks said “the loss rate is 3/10 of
one percent. . . . These are enviable
rates vis a vis our sister institutions.”

A sample of some of the missing
books includes the 1957 Quips and
Cranks, E.F. Schumacher’s Guide to
the Perplexed, H.I1. Montoye’s Longev-
ity and Morbidity in College Athletes,
and volume 62 of the Davidsonian.

asked him if we could have had him if
we’d called earlier, and he said no.”

Hoskins said the committee will put
the money towards the Spring Frolics
concert or an additional conceft this
term. REM, an Athens-based recording
group whose “Chronic Town” EP has
been number one on WDAV’s Flipside
playlist is tentatively scheduled for Sat-
urday 5 February in the 900 Room.

Smith said the Union has had
trouble booking “name” bands because
of competition from commercial prom-
oters. “The only reason we’ ve been suc-
cessful in the past is because we’ ve got-
ten in early,” he said. “There is a great
value in getting ‘name’ entertainment
on campus . . . . We want to be able to
tell people someone’s coming and let
them look forward to it.”

25 at Y meeting

By TIM MCGAUGHEY ’85

Chris Blake, Vice President of the Y
Student Service Corps, reported that the
Y had their meeting with 25 members
this weekend.

Because of the snow the Y had its
meeting on campus instead of in the
mountains. At this meeting the Y tried
to establish goals and set priorities for
the coming year. Chris Blake will an-
nounce these goals for the Y in the com-
ing week.

Hobart Park

By BRIAN BUTLER ’84

“Tt should be safe to say ,” according
to Hobart Park Editor Eric Fichner,
“that the winter edition of the student
written and published art forum will be

‘ out next week.”

Eric says the magazine may contain
some unexpected modes of artwork, in-
cluding sheet music by Bill Heard, a
book review by Economics Professor
emeritus Ernie Patterson, and a series of
reflections on an art exhibit by one of
Gill Holland’s freshman composition
classes.

Suzanne Dickey, recently elected
new Hobart Park editor, served as as-
sistant editor of the publication. English
professors Gill Holland and Tony Ab-
bott read the material and made sugges-
tions, while Debby Williams, Bitsy
Pomeroy, Jenna Buckner, and Darrell
Cooper served as student readers.

750 copies are being printed. They
will soon be available for free around
campus and thereabouts.

EPC finds
daily schedule
‘feasible’

By RICK AVERY ’86

A sub-committee of the Educational
Policies Committee, has examined the
Semester Planning Committee’s pro-
posed daily schedule for the future se-
mester system, at Davidson College and
found it to be “feasible.”

The sub-committee headed by Re-
gistrar Dr. Richards C. Burts, was set
up to examine the SPC’s daily schedule
and to determine its viability.

Exact details of the schedule could
not be released because, according to
Dr. Burts, the schedule is a “first-at-
tempt” and “a lot of questions are still
open.” He added that the general opin-
ion is that the proposed schedule has the
“equitable dispersal of courses through-
out the day” that the system should have
in order to avoid class conflicts in sche-
duling. Dr. Burts does not expect a fin-
ished schedule until next fall or winter.
The target date for the switch-over to the
semester system at Davidson College is
currently set at 1984.

The wraparound covér design, cast
in an unlikely manilla shade, is by Blair
Maxwell and is entitled “Altered Lands-
capes.”

The cover will wrap around poetry
by Roy Fuller, David Resnik, Suzanne
Dickey, and Debby Williams, short fic-
tion by John Marks, Barry Elledge, and
Cathy Grotto, and artwork by Pat Don-
ley and Curlin Reed. Works by three
non-students, Gill Holland, Tony Ab-
bott, and Mrs. Cathy Warren will also
be included.

Eric received enough material to fill
350 pages. The budget, however, holds
the size to 80 pages per term. When a
single artist submits a large quantity of
superior work, the editor is faced by a
real dilemma: should the magazine try
to span a wide variety of personalities,
or should the magazine print the best
material?

Eric says that this issue tries to bring
a compromise between the two atti-
tudes. He first chose the best material,
and then filled in with the best of the
worst, so to speak.

Kluttz Resigns

By RICK AVERY ’86

Officer Harold Kluttz resigned from
the Davidson Police Department last
month and will be replaced at the end of
the month.

Kluttz resigned voluntarily in order
to join the Pineville Police Force, ac-
cording to Davidson Police Chief Jack
Warlick.

He said that Kluttz lives near Pine-
ville and took the job in order to be clos-
er to home. There is no truth to the rum-
or that Officer Kluttz was fired because
of complaints or suits filed against him
or the Town of Davidson, he emphas-
ized, adding that Kluttz was “a good cop
and a good patrolman.”

Kluttz came to work for the David-
son Police Department in September of
1980. He was formerly employed with

- the Charlotte Park Police.

Kluttz will be replaced by Officer
Raymond Thrower Jr. Thrower is an ex-
perienced officer with three years of
prior law enforcement experience. He
has worked for the Iredell County She-
riff’s Department and the Mooresville
Police Department. He has an Asso-
ciate’s Degree in Criminal Justice from
Central Piedmont Community College
and is currently working on his Bache-
lor’s Degree at Pfeifer College. He will
start work January 28.
