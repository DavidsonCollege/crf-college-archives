Juniors Complete Third
Successful College Year

Inasmuch as a more lengthy and cai
sibly more involved history of this Saree!
is to appear in the 1928 volume of “Quips |
and Cranks,” very little may be said here |
other than the quotation of a few statis-|
ticss

Much was expected from this class
from the day of its entrance, due to the
fact that in that year was innovated ‘the
selective draft system of choosing fresh-
men. The result is that the class con-
tains more honor-rolt- men than any oth-
er in the history of the college. In ad-
dition it is indisputable that it contains
alsa moré campus leaders than has any
other. During the freshman year the
athletic teams were not quite up to
standard, but our athletes have developed ;
at the present time we see no reason to
criticize their“efforts,

A few highlights are as follows:

Six men made honor roll during fresh-
man year; eight during sophomore year.
The first two vears are the hardest. Jun-
ior and Senior electives will bring the
number of honor men far ahead of any |
previous record set.

First class to have entire debating team |
and alternate from among its members. |

First class to have fresh banquet. |
Quite a memorable affair (as any Junior
can tell you), with many exciting events |
both on and. off the schedule. Still high- |
ly recommended as a day-time topic dur-
ing Junior Speaking,

Large percentages of Glee Club and or- |
chestra from ’29., A member of this class
has been leader of the jazz orchestra for
three vears.

Four

letter men in football; four in
baseball; four in wrestling; two in bas- |
ketball; one in tennis; three in track,
The change in the old order of Junior
Speaking is an outstanding example of
the progressive spirit of '29. In the past |
there was an enormous expenditure
money and time. Disadvantages were |
numerous—everyone complained, but no-
body took action; class after class fol-
lowed a custom that was out of date.
This year ’29 departs from the beaten
track and adopts a policy that is superior.

Northward, along the spacious ether
track

They come to welcome Spring with min-
strelsy.

Among the grass the timid violets hide,

Among the budding trees. the dogwoods
sway,

Soft, snowy foam afloat an emerald tide

Where butterflies as flying fishes play.

A brook is gurgling in the mossy glade

And Spring herself is laughing in the
shade.

It is Spring I see, or a white-clothed tree
Iw the ferny glen?
Does she rise as a nymph from the crystal
lymph
_To smile at men?
May she laugh in the gleam of the hurry-
ing stream,
In diaphanous robes that are spun from

a dream?

Tis no tree—'tis a maiden with shy brown
eyes

Beaming laughter and joy at my _ sur-
prise.

It is Spring! It is Spring!

Hear her sing:
Hey! Hey!
Come away
Sing and play
Blithe and gay
In the leafy spray

| Where crocuses stand on tiptoe to kiss

the lips of May!

|O Spring, I come to mingle in thy song,

To lose myself within thy verdant walls,
To shed mortality and sense among

' Thy bowers, and melt.me in their dew

that falls,
Dissolve me in the odor of the rose,

Cleave my laborious human vehroyslis |

Gossamer winged to fly far from the |
woes

| Of human kind, and all that is amiss.

daste, Spring to fan me with thine

odorous breath,

|My fevered brow is yearning for its
balm;

Kiss my tired eyes to lulling sleep or|

death,

Oh, bathe me in thy sweet Lethian calm

Let me forget earth’s discord and alarms,
Hedged in the warm contement of thine
arms.

As at rest I dream in the aureate beam
Of thy pleasant sun
May the placid stream of the hour seem
To be never done
Let me ever lie neath thine azure sky
And talk to the white clouds floating by
And sweet Spring, loving Spring
Hear thee sing:
Hey! Hey!
Come away

Minstrel To Be Put On
By Junior Class Talent

Continuing the Junior Week Program,
the Junior class is presenting in Shear-
er Hall this evening a Junior Minstrel.
Regular practices have been held for the
past two weeks and a catchy program is |
forecast.

The production of the minstrel is under
the direction of Mr, Ervin Setzer of Char-
lotte. Mr. Setzer has shown his unusual
talent and coaching ability along theatrical
lines by the management of several pro-
ductions in Charlotte, among which was
“The Jollies of 1928,” the well known gsuc-
cess of which was manifested by its
whole-hearted reception by the public.
Mr. Setzer is widely known not only in
North Carolina but throughout the eastern
part of the United States. He has been at
the head of several productions for the
Central High School students in the re-
cent past.

A feature of the program is an overture
and finale composed and set to music by
Mr. Setzer. These consist of solos and
‘medley work. Assisting those in the min-
strel is a chorus of voices ffom the glee
club and. student body.. A number of
popular selections are interspersed
throughout the program to lend variety
and chie,

J. R. Covington, chairman of the Jun-
ior Minstrel Committee is in charge of the
program, The personnel of the cast are:

Soph Day

Soph Day was welcomed to Davidson

lon Saturday, April 21st, by the whole
|Freshman class in appropriate costume
for the occasion,

Upon rising, each Freshman was com-

pelled to don an outfit consisting of two
dissimilar shoes and socks, a_ military
blouse buttoned in the back, and a head-
piece made of a handkerchief with a
freshman cap perched upon it. To make
the costume complete, two books were
carried in a pillow slip suspended from a
stick over the shoulder. To facilitate
their movements, it was thought that the
freshmen should skip wherever they were.
This they did. with apparent delight.

From 9 to 1 o'clock, from the tops of
the porticos of the several dormitories,
freshmen in the roles of Mohammedan

er, but instead called out the exact minute
of time, adding the worshipful phrase of
“Glory to the sophomores, hallelujah!”
Upon the completion of the announce-
ment, the freshman who had just uttered |
it, would be soused with several gallons
of water coming from an upstairs window.

other had taken his place who underwent
the same experience. It was thought by

some that a more appropriate phrase for
the freshmen to have called would have
been, “Glory to the sophomores, Niagara!”

As part of the celebration, the Fresh-
men staged a circus at the track meet
Saturday afternoon which met with great
success. The show was complete in ev-
ery respect, having every kind of freak
from the ring master to the wild man in
a cage, who unfortunately broke loose in
front of the terrified spectators. After
exhibition of the strong man, the
bearded lady, the snake charmer and other
highly interesting people, the show was

concluded with a marvelous high diving
act, in which the agile performer hit in
the jumping pit without visible injury>
Immediately after the track meet, a tug
‘of war between chosen sides of freshmen
| was held. The side which lost had to col-
lect wood for the bon fire that night, the
celebration around which was to be the
culmination of the activities of the day.

| The ceremonies which were held on the

Freshman field Saturday nignt consisted
of talks, one by Carl Pritchett, past pres-
ident of the Sophomore class, in which he
said that the sophomores appreciated the
spirit which the freshmen had taken in
regard to Soph Day and reminded the
freshmen that they would soon be sopho-
mores. Dean Rusk, past president of the
Freshman class then responded, In con-
clusion,.the freshmen burned their caps,
some.rather regretfully, and then all snug
