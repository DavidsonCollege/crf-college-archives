CANADA, from page 5

a 20-hour rock block with the
Rolling Stones, pressed the
petal to the metal, and headed
for the Great White North...to
Quebec and the Winter Carni-
val. What else are liberal arts
students supposed to do? The
time was 5:55 p.m. on Thurs-
day, Feb. 8, 1990. Thirteen
hours later, as Davidson stu-
dents cast aside their books, to
enjoy the FAC and a 60 heat
wave, we crossed over the
Thousand Islands Bridge into
Canada, listening toGeddy Lee
sing Bob and Doug Macken-
zie’s vintage tune, Takeoff, to the
Great White North.

We were finally in Canada—
after several cans of Mountain
Dew, an apple, and one ba-
nana--and were greeted by the
customs agent who asked us
(in true Canadian vernacular)
“Got anything to declare,
hoser...eh?!” We almost told
him the truth--four cans of
Vienna sausages, three ba-
nanas, three apples, a bunch of
fruit juices and a partridge ina
pear tree--but didn’t. After
customs, the birthing pains of a
morning appetite began. We
timed the pangs and decided
that it was time to eat. After a
most pleasing breakfast of egg
Mcmuffins and danish, we
were off to compete with the
tail end of the Montreal rush
hour.

We flew down the highway
(even faster than most Canadi-
ans) at about 70 mph (116 km/
h) and what's more, we didn’t
really know where the heck we
were going! We even occa-
sioned an officer of the Cana-
dian mounted highway patrol
(and his horse) who had pulled

a semi for speeding...the horse
wasn’t even breathing hard!
Superb conditioning....

Thesuburbs of Quebec beara
semblance to Brooklyn, NY...a
bunch of tenement buildings,
roads with more pot holes than
Noriega’s face, and run down
gas stations charging ungodly
high prices to pay the rent (it
was an Exxon station-- maybe
that’s why). Theold city (Vieux
Quebec) is located on the top of
a mountain, sporting steep
cliffs that overlook the now
frozen St. Lawrence river. The
French havenever been known
to have a very effective army,
but John and I could not help
but wonder, as we charged up
the steepand very icy embank-
ment of the Citadel, how the
French could, even ‘in their

greatest lapse of military apti-

tude, lose the Battle of Quebec
(of French and Indian War
fame) to a bunch of English
redcoats, led by General James
Wolfe. The English couldn’t
even beat a bunch of ill-armed,
ill-clad, ill-mannered, ill-tem-
pered, sexually frustrated Min-

utemen some 27 years later!
Albeit, we didn’t drive 18.5
hours to Quebec to meddle
with history....we intended to
make history.

Having arrived in Quebec
City one half hour later than
estimated 750 miles before in
Roanoke, VA (ifonly we hadn’t
stopped for breakfast at that
damned McDonald’s...), we
were not only tired, but we
were without lodging (and
none too happy about it) The
provincial office of tourism
had told us that many told usin
December that there were no
rooms left torent in the greater
Quebec area; therefore, we set
out to find a room in the lesser
Quebec area (the city itself),
and did...a most inviting
room...a most heinously invit-
ing room, only one egregious
block from party central--rue
Saint-Jean. -

Having secured a room, un-
loaded and parked the car,
assessed the city’s streets and
services (including the bank --
John exchanged much (beau-
coup) money, and I searched
frantically for a Plus machine -
- yes, there was a Plus ma-
chine!), reenacted the famous
Battle of Quebec on the Plains
of Abraham, bought beer, and
cursed the rainy weather of

Canada, we retired to our
newly rented room, where we
took showers (thank God),
drank a beer (Hutch gave it a
C+...describing it as “vaguely
peachy”), and slept.

After a most refreshing nap,
we donned our party/drink-

ing toques and headed for rue
Saint-Jean, which was one
block away, down a steep hill.
Rue Saint-Jean was already
pulsing with “constructive-
partying” fury...we had to find
a bar...and fast. We did....The
cafe Breton—-full of 40 year-old
individuals who looked like
they were experiencing a col-
lective mid-life crisis. We
drank our Labatt’s Blue and got
out of there in a hurry!

We went on to explore the
city atnight. Listening tosome
J.S. Bach piped over outdoor
speakers, we viewed ice and
snow sculptures, walked up to
the Place du Palais (a gigantic
castle made of snow), checked
out the babes, and decided that
our place was in the local bars.
Cool of us. Weerred in ournext
choice, however, going into Le
Bistreau, a disco and teeny

~ bopper hangout. Notonly was

there a $5 cover charge, but we
were forced to listen to butch-
ered Deep Purple and other
classic rock (turned disco)
blasted through hanging
speakers while women danced
in bands, refusing the com-
pany of men. Needless to say, if
you do wanttodance, thisis the
place (despite the music); but,
be sure to bring friends of the
opposite sex because this is not
the place to pick up women.
Perhaps the most inviting
bar/cafe on rue Saint-Jean was
a crepe shop, Casse-Crepe
Breton. The shop is small and
an appetizing aroma greets the
passer-by. Hutch and I fol-
lowed our noses and found
ourselves staring through the
windows. The booths of the
shop were filled by all types,

but above all, the hired help.
caught our eyes most readily.

Two French-Canadian girls
served the clientele. One girl
had a truly Canadian face
which grabbed our attention.

Long hair graced her slight
shoulders and her eyes shone
with innocence as she took our
order. We obliged her gladly...
acting as ambassadors of the
US, ordering apple and cherry
crepes in addition to coffee.
John and I relaxed in the
warmth of the shop and en-
joyed the crepes, which were
prepared in the center of the
room. We stayed for a long
while—about 1.5 hours--during
which time we attracted the
company of not one, but three
women from Boston who
talked with us for 45 minutes
about the differences of north-
ern and southern culture, the
value of a liberal arts educa-
tion, and, most importantly,
about the quality of each of the
18 bars lining Franklin Street in
Chapel Hill, NC.

The night was still young,
and we had many questions to
answer. Although we had
traversed so far under the aus-
pices of partying and beer tast-
ing, we still clung to our liberal
arts education....we were inter-
ested in the French Canadian
feeling toward tourismand the
winter carnival, a question that
may interest the sociologist/
anthropologist here at
Davidson. As the crepe shop
was closing (at 2 a.m.), John
and I made our move. Distin-
guishing ourselves as free-
lance reporters from Charlotte,
NC who were writing a piece
on the Quebec winter carnival,
we asked the French girls, who

Wednesday, February 28, 1990 THE DAVIDSONIAN

spoke very little English, about
their feelings toward the win-
ter carnival and tourism. Al-
though we struggled toask our
questions, the interview was
conducted wholly in French.

The girls did not-enjoy the
winter carnival as much as one
would think. Despite the in-
creased revenue, employees
have to work extra long hours.
In addition, they are required
by law to speak at least a mini-
mal amount of English during
the carnival to placate non-
French speaking tourists,
which they find rather difficult.
Disadvantages aside, the girls
(at least the one that waited on
us) were quite amiable and
very attractive. Our first day in
Quebec had drawn to a close.
Wereturned toour warmroom
and crashed hard.

Saturday morning we awoke
at 7:00 to blizzard conditions
and five feet of fresh snow on
the ground. I eagerly jumped
upoutofbed, donned my bath-
ing suit, and demanded that I
be let loose to run and frolic in
the newly fallen snow....le bain |
de neige (snow bath)....Hutch
ignored my _ excitement,
mumbled “boots...schmoots”
and something aboutirretriev-
able insanity, and promptly
returned to a comatose state
(probably NC). With a mania-
cal laugh, I leapt through the
fifth floor window. into. the
snow, sinking to just about
