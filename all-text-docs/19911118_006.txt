Have We Fo

rgotten The Meaning

of The Declaration of Independence?

By Katja Altpeiter

“We hold these truths to be self-
evident: That all men are created
equal; that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain inalien-
able rights; that among these are
life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness;....”

-Declaration of Independence

This statement--the soul of this
country, the heart of the American
nation put in one sentence. Espe-
cially tonon-Americans, the United
States still represents the country
of equality and of liberty where
everybody can become happy ac-
cording to his or her own ideals.

The fundamental values of the
American Nation are proclaimed
everywhere: equality, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness a thou-
sandfold on posters, T-shirts, build-
ings, in newspapers, on the radio,
on TV, inevery politician’s mouth,
in every proud American citizen’s
heart!

But sometimes these “‘inalien-
able rights” do not seem so very
inalienable. Even at a school like
Davidson, at a “liberal” arts col-

lege, people sometimes seem to
forget on which foundations their
ation is built. Or perhaps those
people just misunderstand the great
words of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence. ‘

Many students seem to mis-
take the phrase “all men are cre-
ated equal” as a premise for every-
body to behave in exactly the same
way. Of course, this way has to be
their own. But the fact that not
every American is born with sports
shoes on their feet, and a baseball
cap on their head should at least
make them question this assump-
tion.

Equality does not mean uni-
formity. Moreover, the idea of
equality implies the respect for
variety. It means that no matter if
somebody wears a nose ring, no
matter if somebody wears their
hair shaved, no matter if some-
body is black, white, red, yellow,
no matter if somebody is Christian

or Jew or Moslem, no matter if -

somebody is homosexual, hetero-
sexual or bisexual, he or she is a
human being like everybody else,
and carries something inside that

Depth! Relevance! |
How Many Bananas Does it Take?

By Frank S. Guzek
(with intro compiled by David
Scott)

Our guest today has lost his
way, confused, a wayward son.
Buthe’s still cool and doesn’tdrool,
and his zipper’s always done.
You’d like him but, unlike him, we
couldn’t guarantee, that he’d like
you, though you with we might
beg to disagree. A tall but gainly
sort, he’s spun a tail or two, but
never for Depth! Relevance! (a
fault that you have too).

Sorry. Like our guest, we’ve
lost our grip on facts. In diction,
plotand decency, but... thenagain
it wouldn’t be, even more it
couldn’t be, Deep & Relevant to
you... it wouldn’t do if we’d
construe to keep the proper syntax.

Now leaping like a dragon
leaps straight for a virgin maid;
we’ll to our point and greet our
guest and quit this serenade. His
name is Frank and frank he is --
The Gooze -- he’s cool and calm.
And for his words we’ll bag itnow,
this our little psalm.

Though I admit it begrudg-
ingly, I too have found myself at
that cold, lonely, post-pubescent
crossroads. And quite honestly,
I’ve gotten down on a knee or two
while there. Thereare some dilem-
mas worth a handshake with ol’
Nick. Frankly, such a bargain
seems more and more reasonable
as I weigh the cornucopia of bene-
fits I’ve reaped at dpc against the
mountainous debt I will face upon
my triumphant graduation. Too bad
Phil Rizutto isn’t in the college
loan business. The Stafford loan
people don’ tstrike meas very good
ball players. =~

Don’t get me wrong. I’m no
_ different from any of the other

worker bees here at dpc. I’ve been
overcome by the tremendous love
of learning, the feeling of coopera-
tion as we all push towards satori,
each student encouraging the suc-
cesses of his peers. Well-trained
will we be as the job market looms.
Competent dpc alumni able to
amble authoritatively at the drop
of aname, able to leap nimbly over
wide swaths of turkey poop, and of
course able to look snottily (snoot-
ily?) down our snoots (snots?) at
our demographic peers who at-
tended less prestigious institutions,
with their creeping non-western
influences.

(I actually heard a friend of
mine say that at some of those
schools there are homosexuals, and
some people who aren’t even
Christian! Can you imagine? What
Sodoms!)

ButI digress. Back tothe cross-
roads.

I think we are all familiar with
those days. Days where you just
can’t seem to tell sh** from shi-
nola. Days where you can’t find
the comics and miss an episode of
Gil Thorpe (I still can’t believe
Lenny Hull didn’t take those ster-

_ oids!). Days where each new morn-

ing is another dull grey swath ina
sort of bitter, saccharine limbo.
The kinds of days that force most
white people to put on a cd of
Kenny G. or Michael Bolton
(because no one knows the blues
quite like Kenny G, and the New
Age Yeti). When every day is, ina
nutshell, a perfect day for
bananafish.

For those of you who don’t
know what bananafish are, be pre-
pared fora morbid tale. They swim
into holes. where there are lots of
bananas (and bananafish luuuuuv
bananas) and then they just pig out.

deserves respect.

Liberty goes even further. The
realization of the idea of liberty
shows if someone has understood
the lesson of equality. Of course,
everybody wants to be free, wants
to be able to express openly emo-
tionsand opinions. For those people
who feel and think like the major-
ity does, liberty is easy to obtain
and self-evident.

Within their circle of similarly
thinking péople they feel free.
Living in that circle of thoughts,
they take the boundaries of their
thoughts as ultimate. But the world
goes beyond the horizon and very
often goes beyond our own per-
sonal feelings and thoughts.

Only if people accept even
those thoughts which lie beyond
their own spheres of experience
and only if those thoughts can be
expressed deliberately can liberty
be realized.

Rosa Luxemburg put this idea
very .bluntly when she said,
“Freiheit ist immer Freiheit der
Andersdenkenden!” (Freedom is
always the freedom to think differ-
ently!)

They go completely mad. I think
they can eatin the neighborhood of
seventy-eight bananas. But. once
they do, they become so bloated
that they can’t get out of the hole
and they die. Just like that. Sev-
enty-eight bananas and you’re
pushing up daisies. How’s that for
a bow! of cherries?

This column seems quite rele-
vant but not very deep.

Intense, and yet, wafer-thin.

I suppose this column is the
Wheat Thin of the Davidsonian. I
love those Wheat Thin commer-
cials with Sandy Duncan. She is so
adorable. And her message is an
importantone. You shouldn’thave
to feel guilty. At least, not about a
thin piece of whéat.

Ikeep getting away from those
crossroads.

I’veconsidered thatmaybe I’m
going through a mid-life crisis. A
decent enough explanation, though
it means I’1l bite the dust before I
hit forty. That’s not even long
enough to finish paying off those
Stafford loans. But hey, if the
education president insists on
voodoo financial aid, I'll not
complain.

MY COUNTRY, RIGHT OR
WRONG.

But certainly not left, I sup-
pose. I think politics may be a bit
too relevant for this column, Al-
though I must say that nothing
warmed my heart quite as much as
seeing Strom Thurmond throw his
protective. wing over Clarence
Thomas (Uncle Thomas, to his
closest friends) as the slings of
outrageous common sense pelted

the bulwarks of have-dom. You’ve -

long way, baby,
Om Bont miss pari 2 of
Guzek's Guest Appearance
in next week's issue!

Davidson is a school that is known
for its high educational level and
that does not accept every appli-
cant makes me even more thought-
ful. i
Iremember many speeches on
this campus which assured the
students that they would comprise
the future leadership elite of this
' country. The thought that some of
the future leaders of one of the
world’s most powerful countries
are so intolerant as to not even
respect different kinds of sexuality
besides their own scares me!

Let me remind you that for
many Europeans, and certainly for
a huge number of people in other
parts of the world, the U.S. still is
thecountry of equality, liberty and
pursuit of happiness. You have a
great heritage--try to take it seri-
ously!

The “pursuit of happiness”
seems to touch the practical aspect
of human beings living together. It
allows every individual to become
happy in exactly the way he or shé
chooses as long as in that pursuit
other people’s rights are not im-
paired.

Does anybody who colors his
or her hair red or green, does any-
body who is feminist, ecologist or
pacifist, does anybody who is |
homosexual or bisexual infringe |
on another’s rights, just for being
what he or she is.

Are not those people who do
notaccept other people’s different
tastes, different cultures, different
religions, different sexualities those
who violate “inalienable rights”?

I am shocked by the intoler-
ance of many students at this col-
lege. Concerning the fact that

F.L.A.G.

to join a support group (remember, that’s what Friends of Lesbians and
Gays is all about). And if they aren’t and have to ask mommy and daddy
for permission, then they shouldn’t be in college.

F.L.A.G. did get a charter as voted on by the members of S.G.A. As
for your money, since some of you are concerned about the funding:
coming from the students’ activity fees, get it back through a voucher or
take your child out of school so you won’t have to pay.

The subject of homosexuality needs to be dealt with in a positive
manner, I feel this is the best way to go about it as do some of the homo-
sexuals on campus. When you see a good friend beaten to a bloody pulp
and left for dead just because of her sexual preference, you begin to
wonder what kind of world this is.

This kind of situation is what F.L.A.G. wants to prevent by educat-
ing people. If it means having a chapter on campus, then so be it.

Ihate to break it to you people, buthomosexuality is here to stay; it’s
not going to just disappear just because you don’t care to fund it.

Sincerely,
Catherine Hines, ‘94

Homeless

Continued from page 5

a strong enough will to want to change his life and teach others from his
experiences, There has got to be a way we can give the homeless a sense
of self worth, encouraging them to do something with their lives.

I think there are more homeless begging for money on the street than
those seeking help from shelters,

I’m notsure I understood the purpose of the vigil either. Sleeping on
the street is only a minor part of being homeless. The lawn in front of
Chambers is too far removed from the situation.

I think a better answer would be for Reach Out to spend some time _
with the homeless; they need to be told that they are their own special
person, and if they wanttochange the way they live, there are people that
want to help. ;

It is good to heighten the awareness of others, but until someone
actually places themself in contact with those that want help, nothing is
going to happen.

Sincerely,
Susan Criscione

Hats

Contiuned from page 5

there may bathers like Mr. Atchison who don’ t agree with this policy.
Butas I see it, life is full of policies that at least one person is not going
to like.

The contemptuous tone Mr. Atchison takes towards Mr. Holland is
certainly uncalled for. Mr. Holland’sreturnto Davidson is certainly one.
of the most positive things that has happened to our athletic program. If
Mr. Atchison cannot see this maybe it is because his hat is blocking his
view:
