Luyambi

/

Luyambi is deaf-mute,
Muena mampampa...

But you did hear me.

He stamped onto the mission compound

And added colorless variety .

To the sterile neutrino swarm which coursed him:
Proverbs, platitudes, trivia, jibes,

Tshiluba, French, now English.

Well, nothing.

Found a disciple of a paleskin child
Patiently farmed for meaning in the hardening crust
Led him through the sights, smells, textures.

But the scream wells,

Rage.
Luyambi grunting, squeaking, grinding his teeth
As he flings sodden clay from the kid’s pet dam.
The pale alien speaking creature cringes aside,
Whimpering at the explosion of the mute tower,
Monster by his despair of understanding

He destroyed to rebuild

But is there yet a difference?

PPLEMENT

Black Icarus

I sludge through prejudices absorbing a a mire re of slurs

Which I squeeze out in untiring prayers. — v ns ne v

Let not my wings fail —

Lest they mold me into glazed ceramic notions
Relegated to a shelf.

From my chrysalis I shall emerge

A beautiful black soul

Never afraid to fly closetothesun,
