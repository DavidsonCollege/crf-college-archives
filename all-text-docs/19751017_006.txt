Ford proposes new | ¢
graduated i Income tax *

‘

‘President Ford has given the ever-

' diminishing ranks of the GOP new
cause for confusion.

After a recent barrage of conserva-
tive rhetoric on the subject of ending
redistributive. federal “social prog-
rams,” Ford has offered a scheme for
fiscal 1977 which has, in the opinion
of this writer, a highly redistrubutive
potenial.

Democratic opposition to this
scheme should cloud the understand-
ing of honest Republicans even fur-
ther.

As reported in the news media, the
Ford proposal reduces individual
income tax rates, reduces corporation
income tax rates by two percent, and
makes permanent the ten percent
investment tax credit (for business.).

According to the Charlotte Ob-
server’s initial article on the Ford
proposal, the new tax plan would cut
the 1974 income tax liability of
families with less than five thousand
dollars’ annual income by sixty-one
percent.

_ The liability of families with less
than ten thousand dollars’ annual
income-would be cut by thirty-five
percent. Tax cuts in higher brackets
would also be substantial--but less
than sixty-one percent.

In other words, the income tax rate
schedule would become more progres-
sive than it already. is.

The other two elements in the Ford
plan are by no means regressive in
themselves.

. (Definitions: Personal income tax is
“sometimes called equitable in that it
bears ‘progressively’. more on those

‘people with higher incomes. Payroll
ahd sales taxes are relatively ‘regres-

sive’ in that they take a larger -

fraction of the poor man’s income

. than they do of the rich man’s.’’--Paul
A. Samuelson, Economics, Chapter
7).

The institutionalizing of the ten
percent investment tax credit is a
‘continuation of last year’s policy and
therefore nothing new.

The reduction of the corporate
income tax rate from 48 to 46 percent
should cause a slowing down of the
rate of inflation.

_ The corporate tax is paid ultimately
by consumers. Under the new plan,
corporate costs of production will
have declined at least. by the amount
of the federal tax decrease.

Cost savings of this kind could and

should be easily passed on to con-'

sumers, if there is any element of
competition left in our economic
system. Republicans believe this to be
the case.

But Republican leaders also are

generally against more government

income redistribution. They are faced

Souldn’t Republican leaders - have

better to redistribute by collecting fi

taxes than to redistribute by
spending them for social programs?
From Gerald Ford to.Jim Martin, all
Republican politicians should answer
that question.

To the Editor:
As a member of: the ‘Davidson

‘College football team I speak only for

myself; however, I feel my views are

’ largely shared by the rest of the squad

as well as by members of. the
basketball team.

I write in response to the ridicuious
and unfounded claims of Don Benson

in the October 10 issue of The
Davidsonian.

First of all, let me say that I detect
no sense of desperation seeping into

_the football and basketball programs.

Much to the contrary, I feel the
efforts now being made by ‘the
football and basketball coaching
staffs, as well as by the entire athletic

department, are positive and neces-

sary steps towards establishing sound ~
winning programs.

Benson’s statement that ‘‘criticism
tor both programs..revolves around
mishandling people, not bending to
the individual” is totally untrue. To

_ my knowledge, nobody on the football

taam has expressed that he has been
taishandled in any way. Neither do I
know.of any player who feels that the
coaches have become indifferent to-
wards his individual needs. °

2 Benson’s contention that ‘‘It seems

- harder for our athletes under these

programs to be an integral part of
student life” is equally absurd.

I fail to see how’ a two-hour study
hall or a training table for one term
removes a player from the main-
stream of campus life. (Incidentally,
the training table is not mandatory

“$4300 would go a long way i in the infirmary.”

Letters to the Editor

and some of the players chose to .
continue meals at their respective
eating houses). —

As far as I can tell, Davidson .

athletes are not nearly as out of touch

with campus life as the library rats.

who feverishly work their lives away
in pursuit of the almighty 4.0.

I think Benson misinterprets the
appearance of football coaches on
freshmen halls ‘‘checking on curfews

and study habits.” First of all, the.

football team has no curfews. I would
like to know how Benson discovered
that we do.

Secondly, my understanding of the
“checking on study habits”. practice
is that it is designed to help the young
players deal with academic problems,
not to enforce study. And I think it is
reasonable to. assume that a first-term
freshman with nearly forty hours of
football a week might encounter
problems.

As for the implication that the
school is not totally honest in its
admissions policy towards athletes, I
call bull. .

’ Can you name a Davidson football

or basketball player in the past four —

years who has been forced to leave
because he could not make it academi-
cally? I cannot, and I have known a
lot of players in the four vipers I have
been here.

I also personally know that there
ar. several upperclassmen, football
players who rank in the top 25 percent
of their class and that there are a
number of prospective doctors, den-
tists and lawyers on both football and
basketball teams. I think we jocks
hold, our own in the classroom.

Benson’s implication that David-

Gridder defends football,
Hunter sides against Dean

son athletes are ‘‘so undisciplined
that they cannot be offered the
choices and dilemmas necessary to
the growth of the individual” particu
larly irks me.

I am not sure Benson ies what

‘ ‘real discipline is. Maybe he should try -
‘eo schedule of a football player for
t

one week. I think his mind would

be changed.
The efforts being. made by the
coaching staffs in both sports are

genuine and constructive moves’ to-

ward establishing winning téams. .
I can say with assurance that every .
member of the football team believes

_in the things the coaches are doing |

and feels that they will pay off in the |
end. We just wish that students like .
Benson would believe also. °.

To the Editor: :
No offense to the-author of last
week’s article of Assistant Dean Mary
Lou Dietler, but I disliked the lead:
“All it takes is a splashy -
yellow dress and long straw-
berry blonde hair worn by a
_ tall, attractive woman for one —
‘to realize that they aren’t on
Will Terry’ s side of the dean's _
offices.’

Sure, Ms. Dietler is goodinekine.
but would it make sense to say “‘all it .
takes is a splashy T-shirt, desert
boots and a mature hair trim worn by
a short funny-looking man for one to
realize that he/she isn’t on Mary Lou
Dietler’s side of the deans’ offices.’’?
