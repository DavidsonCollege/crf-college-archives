Truth and the travel

Rob Spach

ler: whose journey is it?

¢ Truth,” said-a traveller,
“is a breath, a wind, a shadow, a
phantom. —
Long have I pursued it,
but never have I touched the hem
of its garment.”

~ -Stephen Crane

In one way or another we’re
all travellers. If you’re not travel-
ling, you’ ve probably either lost a
wheel or you’re six feet under.
We’ reall coming from somewhere
and going somewhere. And
whether it’s now or a few months
from now ora few years from now,
we’re all sure to stop and wonder
what’s true about this long, strange
trip we’re on, wonder about our
lives, about our world, about the
universe, God and other. such mi-
nor details.

The four years of college are a
great opportunity to think about
truth, to travel down roads of pos-

sibility, to follow not just the nice,
neat pathway that’s been cleared
through the woods by those who’ ve
gone before, but to wander off the
beaten track and crunch through
the piled up leaves and branches
and brambles to find your own
way, to make your trek toward

others it’s through asking ques-
tions in a philosophy or religion or
literature or science class.

For still others it’s through
involvement in one of the many
fellowship groups on campus or
through En Route, a group that
reflects on art, music, poetry, and

said hook, line, and sinker, but that
we pay attention to what they’ ve
seen and said.

There’s an American novelist
named Frederick Buechner who
called his biography The Sacred
Journey.

The truth that he recognized is

what seems inter-
esting and beauti-
ful and meaningful:
to you.

The spiritual
life is one of the

that all of our
travels are

we were all
created—

breathtaking aspects of those trav-

it any mind. It can be like negoti-

Forsome people here that hap-
pens while talking over a cup of
coffee or a beer with friends; for

spiritual writings through a wide
range of traditions including Bud-
dhist, Taoist, Muslim, and Chris-
tian.

In this travelling, the exciting
thing is to be as interested in ques-
tions as in answers and to appreci-
ate how others who’ve come be-

Don't complain; make your voice heard.

I had the good fortune of visiting
West Africa this summer. While
there, my group and I visited four
universities—one in Senegal, one
in Cote d’ Ivoire, and two in Ghana.
Every school had its own strengths
and weaknesses, yet all had one
thing in common: each university
was.experiencing a strike of some
sort.

_ The students at the schools
had struck for different reasons,
most of them having to do with a
lack of adequate facilities and ma-
terials. But as poor as these coun-
tries are, when the student body
strikes, people listen. A compro-

mise is reached and a slightly im- ©

proved educational system contin-
ues until the next strike.

After observing the attitudes
of these students, I began to realize
how passive Davidson students are,
myself included. Not many of us
realize how much power we would
have as a unified force. After all,
without students there would be no
Davidson. ~

No cause is too small to pro-
test. This year the price of parking

stickers has been raised from forty ©

dollars to fifty dollars. Ihave never
understood why at a school with
tuition as high as Davidson’s we
should have to pay to park on cam-
pus at all.

We pay for our rooms; why
should we pay to park? My friends
who live off campus don’t have to
pay an additional fee to park in

their driveways.

Most of the people I’ve spo-
ken with say that they can’t afford
a fifty dollar parking sticker, but
that is not the issue. If everyone
could afford this price hike it would
still be absurd.

After hearing about the park-
ing decals, my mind drifted back to
Africa. Although parking stickers
may not be a pressing issue to
everyone, I believe it is an impor-
tant one.

If you think the rise in the
price of stickers is unfair, make
your voice heard. If you have any
complaints about the way things
work around here, don’t just bitch
about them—do something. You
can make a difference.

whether we call that one God or
some other name or no name at
all—is at work in our lives in ways
big and small, in ways that we can
sometimes even recognize if we
stop and listen to our lives, listen to
the stories of who we are, how we
got that way, and where we might
be headed.

But this listening can only
happen when we ask questions,

when we don’t settle for easy, sim-
plistic answers, when we peer deep
down the pathway of our lives,
looking at both the awful times as
well as the beautiful vistas.

The other truth that Buechner
recognized—comforting to some,
discomforting to others—is that
no matter how determined we are
to trek out on our own, to find our
own way, we’re never finally alone,
because that one who created us
never abandons us.

We’re not always protected
from death—or from life, for that
matter—but neither are we just
cast into a meaningless nothing.
Our journeys, our lives, our stories
are sacred.

So, as we pursue Truth like
Stephen Crane’s traveller, we may
come to realize that Truth is also
pursuing us.- Bon voyage.

Do you really have

a

choice?

Davidson College is known fora
lot of different things. It is viewed
as one of the best academic schools
in the country. It is known for its

“honor cdde! anid: “Safe” -enfviron-

ment. And it is known for its
friendly people. Some wouldeven
argue that it is extremely multi-
cultural, but I’m not sure that this
is really true. :
Sure, a lot of different cul-
tures are represented on this cam-
pus, but this in itself does not make
each student culturally conscious.
Many different people from

‘many different backgrounds walk

on this campus, but there is still
one overwhelming group on this
particular campus, that being the
ninety percent of students who are
white.

This affords each person
within this group the “opportu-
nity” to never interact with anyone
outside of his culture, outside of
his race: It is very possible, as a
white student, to attend Davidson
for four years and only glance at or
give a quick smile here and there to
students of a different race. And
those of you who plan to do this are
the ones who are not being fully
educated. :

If you allow yourself to put
away certain stereotypes, certain

fears, certain apprehensions, then!’

am sure that you will get a lot more
from your stay here at Davidson.
To know another’s thoughts, to
know another’s feelings, will al-

low you to get more in tune with '

your own thoughts, your own feel-
ings.

I'm sure that we all wonder
why an African-American, a Na-
tive-American,: an Hispanic-
American, or any other minority
would choose Davidson.

Did they come because the
white race is that much wiser? Did
they come to get special treatment?
Did they get in because on some

incredible affirmative action pro-
gram? Do they really belong?

For the rest of your time at
Davidson, you have the opportu-
nity to stop the speculation and get
real answers to these questions.
You have the ability, right now, to
become a better politician, a better
doctor, a better lawyer. How can
you expect to be great leaders of
tomorrow, making decisions for
people that you do not know, for
people that you have not allowed
yourself to know?

Most of you have probably
only known a handful of minority
members in your entire lifetime.
And most of the minorities on this
campus have probably only known
whites at a distance, from what is
portrayed in the media.

On this campus, those mi-
norities have already made a huge
step to learn more about you. Sim-
ply from attending this college they
have to interact with white stu-
dents on a personal and academic
basis; there is just no way to get
around it.

Now itis yourturn. You have
the chance to get to know real
people instead of just the silly ste- .
reotypes. You have the chance to
make them feel like wanted
Davidson students, or some un-

. wanted experiment.

Getting to know different races
is not a requirement of Davidson
College. Facing the fears caused
by stereotypes that you have built
up inside is not required, but maybe
it should be.

Maybe you should force your-
self actually to grow and learn.
With all the racial tensions, the
racial ignorance, and the racial in-
sensitivities seen in this country
and on this campus, do you really
have a choice?

Or maybe you should just sit
back and expect everything to just
go away.
