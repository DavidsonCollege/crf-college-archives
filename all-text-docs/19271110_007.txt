Pep meetings,

“All students that go to the game must go
on the special train. "No one will be allowed
to bum up to the game and then register
there. This is done because of the fact that
it will be necessary to get 125 men to go on
the special, and it is feared that if the stu-
dent body is given the choice to bum or pay
$5.25 for a ride, that it will be impossible to
run the special train,” says “Spike? McGee.
“Spike” also pointed out that if the special
was not run that it would be almost impos-
sible for all of the students to get to the
game.

Davidson Alumni in New
York Gather Friday For

Annual Dinner - Meeting

Forty-Eight Alumni Residing in
New York and Vicinity Will
Attend Meeting

Forty-eight Davidson College alumni,
residing in New York City and vicinity
will gather at the New York Advertising
Club, 23 Park Avenue, on Friday evening
jat 8 p. m. for the annual fall meeting of
|the New York Davidson Alumni Associa-
tion, according to a notice received at
the alumni office early this week.

The New York Alumni Association,
which embodies not only the
City of New York but nearby sections of
New Jersey as well, was established a
number of years ago and at the pres-
ent time is the northernmost organization
of Davidson alumni. Present officers of
the association are W. P. Anderson, -’o7,
president; H, A. Johnston,*’02, vice-pres-
ident; Hadley A. Hill, ’21, secretary and
treasurer,

In view of the impossibility of*sending a
| representative of the/ general alumni of-
| fice to the fall meeting of the New York
| association, telegrams and letters of feli-
citation have been forwarded from the
college to the alumni of that section.

Davidson Safe if
Rabbit Feet Last
Says ‘Doc’ Charlie

“Doc Charlie,” as he is known to nearly
all of the Davidson students and has been
for many a year, says that this year’s
football team seems to be better than ever
before to him. “I’ve been rubbing down
the Wildcats for about twenty-four years
now and I hope to be doing the same
thing twenty-four years from now. After
every football season is over I just know
that there can’t be another team as good
as the last one, and then the next year
they always seem to be better than any
of them, Every year before football
starts people all over the state begin say-
ing that Davidson won’t do much this
year, and then they come along and win
everything, This rabbit foot of mine
may have something: to do with it. Its
not everybody that knows how to treat
one, you got to handle them right. And
then most of all you’ve got to have a
Wildcat rabbit foot to do any real good.”

“Doctor Charlie’ came to work for the
Davidson Athletic Association when he
was about fifteen years old and has been
working for it steadily ever since... He
has worked under such men as Captain
| Bill and Mr. Robert Fetzer, Coaches
| Bruin, Graham, Levine, and Gray, and
last of all Coaches Monk Younger and
|Tex Tilson. Coach Younger came to
school at Davidson one vear, that of '16.
He stayed long enough to win four let-
ters that one year, however. And accord-
ing to Doc Charlie he was one of the best
ends Davidson ever had or ever willhave.

When “Doe Charlie” came to Davidson
the football field was where the tennis
courts are now and the players were rub-
bed down in their own rooms in Old
Chambers.
|
| Beginning Tuesday, November 8th, and
continuing for four’ Tuesdayenights, the re-
entry rifle match will be held here. Partici-
pants in this contest will be members of the
student body, and anyone from outside desir-
ing to take part in it. Firing will be held in
the indoor galery in the gymnasium.

|
|

The plan under Which the competition will
be conducted is that each man fire four scores
prone, sitting, kneeling, and standing—each
evening during the period of the match.

The holder of the highest score at the con-
clusion of the firing will be awarded a trophy
given by Capt. Reid Morrison, Davidson
graduate of 1902, of Mooresville.

It is expected that among those from out-
side the student body taking part in the com-
petition will be certain marksmen from
Statesville and Charlotte.

The new automobiles are coming in in
a variety of colors, but the pedestrians
will still have to be content with black
and blue—Wet Hen.
