By MARK BARRETT

Julia Pidgeon and J.J. Sum-
merell are vying for the only
contested. College Union posi-
tion in this year’s election, the
Social Vice Presidency.

Jim Robertson is running
unopposed for the Union Presi-
dency, and Jamie Ashmore has
no competitors for the job of
Co-Curricular Vice President.
Al Rak had been registered as a
candidate for Union President,
but announced Wednesday that
he has withdrawn his candi-
dacy.

The Union Social Vice Presi-
dent oversees various recrea-
tional and social offerings of the
Union, while the Union Co-Cur-
ricular Vice President is in
charge of cultural and -educa-
tional programs. The Union
President coordinates these two
departments and handles major
organizational duties.

Pidgeon, a sophomore, says
she is running because, ‘‘I enjoy
working with people and have
abilities and ideas which I wish
to contribute to the Union and
the students.”

‘I hope to help provide a
large variety of social activities.
I will be receptive to ideas from
the student body and hope to
get people excited about and
involved in Union programs.”

She-gave-—as-some_of her
qualifications, ‘‘my desire to

work and my previous ex-
perience this year includes
helping with freshman: orienta-
tion, working on publicity and
tickets for the Artist’s Series,
and being head of publicity for
the Top Hats and Cat Tails
Talent Show.

J:J. Sumerell,\a junior, said
he decided to run because, “‘I
wish to channel my energies
into something constructive in
an area besides academics. I
now have some free tifine and
would like to contribute it to the
school.”’

“One of the things I would
hope to accomplish as Social
Vice President is to continue

‘Improvement in coordination

among Patterson Court mem-
bers and between Patterson
Court and the Union, with the
aim of having an even distribu-
tion of social events through the
year.

“T would also like to promote,
although with a different
approach than has been pte-
viously taken, social contacts
between UNCC and Davidson,
and to increase the variety of
social events available to the
Davidson student in general.”

Although he admitted he did
not have a great deal of ex-
perience in Union affairs Sum-
merell commented that he has
an adequate beginning know-

ledge of the Union, and has-

been discussing the Union with

.$800 tuition credit?

(Continued from page i)

In the 1975-76 schoolyear,
North Carolina students atten-
ding private schools began to
benefit from another program,
the Legislative Tuition Grant
Program. Every North Carolina
student at a private school—re-
gardless of financial need—was
given an outright tuition credit
of $200. That amount was
increased to $300 in 1977-78,
and now stands at $400.

Thus, each student from
North Carolina attending an
in-state private school receives
an average of $600, courtesy of
N.C.. taxpayers. The two pro-
grams cost $13.8 million dollars
last. year, including the quarter
of a million dollars for David-
son.

_ The controversy that is. ex-

pected to erupt in the legisla-
ture centers around a request by
the private schools to increase
the Legislative Tuition Grant
Program—the outright tuition
credit—by $200 by 1980-81.

bial camp frcostaagen

endorse the $200 increase.
To be continued next week.

The coming installment fo-
cusses on the debate between
the UNC board and’ private
schools. Davidson President
Samuel Spencer comments on
the arguments pro and ‘con for
the private schools’ proposal.

some of its committee chair-

men. He- closed by saying, “I

have the time; ability, and

desire to do a good job.”
Robertson, a junior history

- major, said he*is looking for- ‘ 4

ward to the opportunity to work
in the Union as its president.

“I hope to make the Union a
place that will truly serve the
College community—not just
an alternative to academics, but
an important part of the overall
Davidson experience. I would
like to integrate the Union more
into the general lifestyle of the
College and get students in-
volved i Fits working ‘on its
activities:

“IT am ‘especially concerned
with getting many ideas from
students for Union offerings,
and in providing a good variety
of these activities.

“TI also intend to investigate
th possibility of using the
facilities of the upcoming Col-
lege Commons for Union pro-
grams.’

Ashmore, also a junior, said
he is anxious to begin work as
Co-Curricular Vice President,
but that he was sorry that
“student apathy was such that
I am running unopposed.’’

Ashmore said he will concen-
trate his efforts on ‘‘coordi-
nating the Co-Curricular sub-
committees, getting more
people involved in co-curricular
activities.
