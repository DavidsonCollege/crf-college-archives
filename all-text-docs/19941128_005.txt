Dean Rusk Student
Advisory Committee
charter approved

By Susan Warren

On Wednesday night the SGA
approved the charter for the Dean
Rusk Student Advisory Commit-
tee. With acharter, the Dean Rusk
Committee will receive “official
recognition,” according to Appro-

- priations Committee member Chad
Lloyd.

The Dean Rusk Program plans
lecture series, foreign films, study
breaks, and other activities to en-
courage international awareness on
campus. The committee wanted a
charter because, in addition to the

recognition, the charter will allow
the group to petition for funds from
the activities council.

Kelly Dixson, Vice Chairman
of the committee, speaks about the
Dean Rusk Program: “It’s really
open to anything the student wants
to do.”

The charter states that its pur-
pose is “to advise the administra-
tion of the Dean Rusk Program on
how best to serve international in-
terest on campus as well as to take
an active role in forwarding inter-
national awareness.”

leave the Commons open later on
days when the team practiced late
so that they would have more op-
tions than merely sandwiches and
chips.

Also, the football team would

getto the Commons near the end of
dinner when some offerings had

tun thin. As Metzler says, “I’ve

responded to those needs. We’ve
cooked something to satisfy those
needs.”

My field trip to the Commons

‘ confirmed what Wood says about

the Commons and its staff: “It’s a

Commons is working to serve students

process, and we take it very seri-
ously.”

No one can say that the Com-
mons is perfect. But no one can
say that Vail Commons is not
willing to listen and to respond. It
was a very successful field trip
indeed.
