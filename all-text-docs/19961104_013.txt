Kruse’s Cubby
Seniors
to bid Big
D adieu

By MIcHAEL KRUSE

Sports Editor

Senior co-captain John
Cowan has started all 38 football
games Davidson has played since
he arrived on campus in the fall
of 1993.

But the 39th — this Satur-
a ary
against

Richardson
Field at
1:30
will be ex-

tra-spe-

and 11
other seniors — Jay Ariail, A.R.
Barrington, Chris Currie, Kevin
Graham, Dan Jonas, Dunn
Mileham, Pat Montoya, Pete
Perri, Kirk Roberts, Mike Rush,
and Michael Warrick - will be
honored ina pre-game ceremony
before making the final home
appearance of their careers.
“It’s getting harder and
harder every week because I re-
alize the end is near,” said Cowan,
after Saturday’s nail-biting win
at Hampden-Sydney. “I think all
the seniors do.”

And / think that, five, ten,
twenty years from now, when
Wildcat gridiron fans look back
to a definitive turning point for
Davidson football, they will point
to this class and this 1996 team.

Cowan epitomizes the rare
synthesis of academic and ath-
letic genius, the type of hybrid
being over which Davidson
coaches and administrators drool.

The 6-2, 235-pounder is the
Wildcats’ most dominant offen-
sive lineman and also sees lim-
ited action in key defensive situ-
ations, where he has tallied three
sacks this year.

But he shines yet brighter
| off the field. Cowan, who worked
inhospitals in Pakistan and China
last summer, is a Stuart Scholar;

Council, an honor student in
Physics and is awaiting word on

sometime after Thanksgiving.

“He’s that kind of guy, that
when he talks, you just stand
there and listen,” said sophomore
Ben Spivey, who leads the team
in sacks with four. “Everyone
really looks up to him. He com-
mands a lot of respect.”

And so do the other seniors,
who came to Davidson with
fourth-year head coach Tim
Landis and have played an
‘|irreplacable role in an on-going
effort to build a consistent win-
ner here.

Rugby rucks and rolls over Blue Devils

By CLAYTON SCHLOSS
Staff Writer

The Wildcats put on a rugby
clinic at Durham on Saturday,
whipping Duke, 42-0.

Fullback Frank Killian led the
Wildcats, scoring three tries in what
was by far his biggest game of the

season. He modestly credited his
teammates for his performance.

“T had a big game, but it was
really because of all the other guys
out there, especially (inside cen-
ter) Graham Powell,” said Killian.
“They did a great job, and I was
just in the oon place at the right
time.”

Hooker Eric Borgstrom,
wingman Christian Baker, and
eight man Michael Schenck also
tallied one try apiece. Fly-half
Hank Ackerman did the kicking
for Davidson in place of Matt
Burkhardt, who did not play for
disciplinary reasons.

“Even though they had more

size than us, we made up for it with
skill,” said flanker Thayer Long.
“Tt was never really a question of
whether we would win, but by how
much.”

The Wildcats travel to Elon
College next Saturday and host
rival UNC Charlotte the following
weekend in the season finale.

HAMPDEN-SYDNEY,
VA— After launching a 50-yard
field goal — the third longest in
Davidson history — last week,
Saturday’s game-winning 25-yard
chip shot with three seconds left
posed little problem for Dunn
Mileham, as the senior placekicker
gave the Wildcats an electrifying
24-21 victory over Hampden-.
Sydney.

“T guess I’m glad it was just
25 and not 50 like last week,” said
Mileham,
whose
brother,
Scott, is a
freshman
defensive
™ back for the
Tigers.

“The
snap was
there,
(quarterback: and holder) Tommy
(Dugan) got the ball down, and I
got the ball up and in. Things
have worked out well for us this
year. It was a big game for us.”

The contest marked a tale of
two halves, as Davidson (4-4) con-
trolled the first and Hampden-
Sydney (2-6) dominated most of
the second.

Rookie wideout Ben Brown
putthe Wildcats on top, 7-0, catch-
ing a 14-yard scoring pass from
Dugan with 1:29 left in the open-
ing quarter.

Tiger quarterback Walt
Bondurant — Davidson senior
volleyball player Ami
Bondurant’s brother — knotted
the score five minutes into the
second quarter, sneaking in from
a yard out. *~

But the Wildcats ended the
half witha flury, tallying two touch-
downs in the final 1:28 before in-
termission — a four-yard Lorenzo
Moll scamper around the left end
and an 11-yard dump pass from
Dugan to Eric Ferguson — to take
a commanding 14-point lead.

Ferguson’s score capped a
five-play, 62-yard hurry-up drive
that spanned just 47 seconds.

But the Tigers snatched the
momentum from the get-go in the
second frame, converting 4-of-4
fourth down attempts on its way to
176 yards of total offense in the
last 30 minutes.

Hampden-Sydney’s Michael
Rhodes registered a two-yard run
with 4:41 left in the third and Andy
Pritchett grabbed a 6-yard touch-
down toss from Bondurant, as the

Tigers evened the count at 21 with
ten minutes remaining.

But a last-ditch march by the
Wildcat offense in the game’s fi-
nal minute-and-a-half covered 64
yards on ten quick plays, setting
the scene for Mileham’s heroics.

Junior Eric Sapp made two
crucial catches during the decisive
drive, including a 23-yarder in a
third-and-ten situation.

“Kids step up and make big
plays,” said head coach Tim
Landis. “Eric did that today. That
catch he made in the last drive, that
was bigtime.”

for 226 yards and a pair of TDs.

“Tommy had a hot hand
there,” added Landis. “He’s im-

and he stepped up and had one of
his best outings.”

As did linebacker Shreve
Ariail, who turned in one of the
great individual defensive efforts
of the year, collecting 20 tackles,
a sack for 13 yards, and a fumble
recovery.

Lineman Ben Spivey re-

“The offense had two key
drives (one at the end of both
halves),” said co-captain John

plays at the end of the game. That

Swimmers race well at Va. Tech, women top W & M

By WILL BRADSHAW
Sports Editor

After an unscored relay meet
at Emory on Oct. 19, and the intra-
squad Red/Black meet on Oct. 26,
the swim team opened their regu-
lar season schedule at Virginia
Tech on Saturday.

“This is one of the best dual
Rich DeSelm said. “By far the fast-
est times we’ ve swam at this point
since I’ve come. It was very excit-
ing, and the team handled it great.
There was a lot of team support
and good racing.”

On the women’s side, the team
grabbed a 121-118 dual meet vic-
tory over William & Mary, but fell
to Virginia Tech 148-94. The men
dropped close decisions to both

schools, 123-108 against William
& Mary and 119-112 versus Vir-
ginia Tech.

“We all pulled together and
supported each other which made
the difference,” co-captain of the
women’s team Catherine Ander-
son said. ““We’ve stepped up to a
new level and now we have a
chance to beat teams we’ve never
been competitive with before.

“T think we have a very strong
chance of winning Southern States.
We have a great group of freshmen
girls who have added speed and
strength to the team and made us
extremely competitive. We’re go-
ing to surprise a lot of teams this
year.”

And you can put William &
Mary at the top of that list.

In a meet that was close

throughout, William & Mary
seemed to take a nearly insur-
mountable lead by grabbing ‘the
top three spots in the 200 yard
breast. Even after taking first and
third in the freestyle relay (the fi-
nal event), Davidson seemingly had
lost 119-118.

But two scoring errors re-
versed the outcome, giving
Davidson the win.

“We came out thinking we
had lost, but the numbers (after
correcting the scoring errors) add

up. Their coaches still have to agree, .

but we should have the win,” coach.
Rich DeSelm said.

Kathleen Paffenroth had a
huge day for the Wildcats, win-
ning the 1,000 free, and 200 fly and
getting touched out by a Virginia
Tech swimmer in the 500 free to

finish second. Zannah Bozzone
won the 200 free, placed second in
the 200 back, and swam the open-
ing leg of the medley relay which
finished second. Mary Shell
Brosche took first in the 200 Indi-
vidual medley and the 100 free, as
well as swimming on both second-
place relays.

Because the meet was scored
as a double dual meet, Paffenroth’s
and Bozzone’s second place fin-
ishes in the 500 free and 200 back
were first place finishes against
William & Mary.

_ Inthe men’s races, Davidson
fell just short of pulling off two big
upsets.

“The fact that we were able to
compete as well as we did against
