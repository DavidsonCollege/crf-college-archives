But things did not continue in the same
light when Droop got in West End High
School of Bluefield for there he became
known as the leader of his boy-friends
and the unchallengeable hero of the
“ladies.” As most all good men do, our

life was gleaming through the bright blue
—sky-blue—eyes of this “little man who

Fresh Range Firing
is Near Completion

The season for the Freshman Range
Firing is just about to be completed. The
system in which this work has been car-
|ried on during this year is very different

-|and much better than any way in which

it has been done before. Every Freshman
is required to make at least two trips to
the range and on one of these occasions
he must make a score of 43. On the first
trip each man fires five rounds froma
prone position with the aid of the sand-
bag. Then, on the same afternoon he
fires ten rounds from the prone position
without the aid of the rest. On the next
trial he fires 20 rounds without any rest
and if he obtains his required score on
any one of these trials he has completed
his work. A score of 43 gives the stu-
dent a passing grade of 70. For each
point over this required score he gets
credit for 5 points-on his grade. The best
score of the three is taken as his final
grade.

A good deal of interest has been taken
in the work tHis year as the competition
is keen for the medal that is promised to
the one with the highest score. Also a
rifle te#m will be composed and some of
the Freshmen with the highest scores will
undoubtedly be members of the team.
This is the first year during which Fresh-
men have been allowed to be included as
members of the team. Possibly can-
didates for this activity are E. B. Len-
non, H. C. Harrel and Murray Christian.
Another incentive which makes a man
strive to do his best is that the niaking
of this score is a prerequisite for the
standing of examinations. As a whole
much better scores have been made this
year than those made by last years Fresh-
men class.
