It’s tournament time on campus and anyone in some

way associated with athletics can feel it.

There’s something strange about tournaments. They

jaffect you in funny ways. Sometimes it’s loss of appe-|
tite or sometimes an inability to get to sleep at night or'|
maybe just a general nervoushess. I guess the best phrase Week, the Phi Gams are
to describe it is an air of expectancy.

But more feelings are aroused than these out-
ward signs of tension exhibit. The desire to win
qucils up within to the highest pitch of the sea-
son. There’s the yearning to make every shot, stroke,
or stride count. You want to win for yourself, but,
more than that, for the fellows back at school, and
probably even more, for the coach who has brought
you this far along the line.

Wildcat Nine Nears
1933 Record of 12-5

The Davidson baseball team moved out of a first
place tie in the Southern Conference when Washington

and Lee defeated Richmond, and climbed into first
place.
The Wildcats, with ten vie-;both games in the seventh in-

tories and three losses, have al ning
chance to break the 1933 ree
ord of twelve wins and five
losses, by winning three of
their next four games.

Dee Green started the
game and was relieved by
Dee Lide, who was credited
with the victory. Allen
Moore finished the game
for the Wildcats which was
won in the last inning when
the tie was broken by a
three run Davidson rally.

Tomorrow the team faces
Furman in a double-header.
Although the Furman team
doesn’t have the impressive
won-lost record that David-
son does, they could prove
to be troublesome. Good
hitting and pitching will
determine the outcome.

In the second contest Moore
relieved Daye Page and won a
9-4 victory, With two. out, and

inning, Pat Henderson broke
