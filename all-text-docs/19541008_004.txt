Orators Or Editors?

Elections came and went last spring
with the usual quips and cranks and won-
ton wiles used by the various candidates
in trying to outdo each other with speech-
es, Spring breezes did what they could to
waft much of the hot air out of Chambers
windows, but as the days wore into weeks,
and as the two presidents were elected
and the next series of men came up for
the races, i.e. the editors, speech making
and speech auditing became increasingly
difficult.

To present a platform in such a way
as to make yourself public without mak-
ing yourself a public nuisance and your
opponent a public scandal was the primary
purpose of setting up the speech making
as such in the spring elections. This sys-
tem has worked out very well in elections
for the two presidents (YMCA and Stu-
dent Government), but as concerns the
election of publications editors it seems to
be both misplaced and useless.

It is with this and the current Constitu-
tional revision by the Student Council in
mind that we propose to abolish speech
making on the part of candidates for the
editorial offices, replacing them with a
better mode of presentation of editorial
platforms.

We propose this abolition and change
for the following reasons: 1) Editors are
first writers and men of the printing trade,
not orators. The ‘proof of their ability
should be not in the number of laughs
and claps they can get before the Student
Body but in written form showing first
their ability to present their platform and
second their knowledge of the trade which
they must master as editor. 2) Elections
are much too long, and there is at present
concentrated effort to shorten them. Fore-
going of speeches by the candidates would
provide a cutting by days or even weeks
from the present schedule.

The question remains of what could
take the place of speeches. The following
suggestion applies to The Davidsonian and

might apply also to the other two major
college publications.

We would like to suggest that an edi-
torial by candidates stating their platform
in black and white be published in the
Davidsonien on the Friday before elections
for the respective editorships take place
on Monday. The entire editorial page
would be given over to the candidates of
the publication, and students could spend
the weekend examining the platforms,
the style and experience of writing, and
the knowledge of the mechanics of print-
ing exhibited by the candidate in his plat-
form.

This method would save time and be
fairer to the candidates involved, and,
much better for the student body as a
whole the candidate's platforms would be
preserved in The Davidsonian for handy
reference at later dates. The only draw-
back seen would be the possible draw-
back of past qualifications for the job. On
the paper many candidates have done
much more work and are more familiar
with journalism than others. Speeches are
utterly useless in presenting the knowl-
edge of the mechanics of publication, and
even editorials could do little better. The
Student Body itself would have to be re-
sponsible for learning qualifications retat-
ing to experience.

One suggestion as to stating of qualifi-
cations of each candidate, the outgoing
editor could give a short statement on
each man on the morning of election or on
the previous Friday.

A fairer selection of editors and a
speedier election period are what is aim-
ed at by the above propositions. We hope
that the Student Body will take these sug-
gestions, think them over, and present
personal opinions of them to the present
editors. We also hope that the Student
Council will keep them in mind while
working toward a revision of the constitu-
tion this fall.

Rubes, Boobs, Country Bumpkins....

It is written that “The Court of Con-
trol was founded by an amendment to the
Student Constitution in the spring of 1923
for the purpose of investigation and deal-
ing with charges made by upperclassmen
against freshmen who exhibited improper
conduct, broke the hallowed traditions of
the college, or violated the Freshman Reg-
ulations.” (The Wildcat Handbook, Vol.
46, p. 11)

“Improper Conduct” is much too mild
a term for the boorishness exhibited dur-
ing the court meeting last Friday by the
members of the upper three classes. The
student body acted like a mass of idiots
turned loose to stage 9 vast sitdown riot,
and the whole fantastic affair made the
Court meeting look to the freshmen like
a time that the upperclass children set
aside to have some fun.

There is no room for such conduct on

the part of the student body if the Court
is to have any effect. The Court is neither
a hazing nor a penal body. It exists to
help freshmen who cannot adjust to life
here, learn how to fit in their proper
place. If the upper classes make the court
a laughing stock on the days it meets,
those freshmen who are supposed to im-
prove by its actions will listen to its ad-
vice with the ears of a cynic senior dur-
ing a two-hour sermon on the escatologi-
cal meaning of II Thessalonians 4.

When the time arrives for the Court
to meet again we hope things will have
improved. Getting freshmen started here
is serious business, but it begins to appear
now as if a new court will have to be or-
ganized to take care of sophomores, jun-
iors and seniors, whose place seems of
late to be little above the monkeys and
much lower than the angels.

..And Freshman Prigs

Davidson’s most hallowed tradition is
its friendliness. When the present Senior
Class entered college its members were
astounded during the Orientation Period
by the careless friendliness that they met
everywhere as they got to know the cam-
pus. Everyone in the college has agreed
during the past years that if there is one
Davidson tradition which needs preserv-
ing it is the tradition of friendliness.

The men in the red caps this year do
not seem to agree. We have noticed dur-
ing the past few weeks that if this year’s
freshmen are outstanding at all it is their
cold stares and unreturned greetings that
make them so.

Recently on a morning walk from the
postoffice we decided that we would take

an informal count of responses to David-
son’s trademark saying, “Hey, how’re
you?” We passed at least twenty fresh-
men on the return trip, and about five
upperclassmen. We received five re-
sponses.

If the Court of Control is unable to
hammer the cockiness out of the 1954
freshmen, we hope that it will at least be
successful in talking them into civility if
not amiability. Perhaps their natural po-
sition is so far above the rest of the school
that they cannot be approached or talked
to by their vassals in the upper classes.
They will have to prove this, however,
and they certainly haven't taken many
steps in that direction so far.

Just A Benign Despotsism ... .

Why There’s No Real

Student Government

BY LEIGHTON McCUTCHEN

I wish that I could honestly say
that we had student government
here at Davidson. Now the students
that drew up the present constitu-
tion and student regulations had
it, and I think that we could have
it if we dared, but. at. present we
do not.

You see, they drew up the pres-
ent system of rules in answer to
problems which they felt needed
to be answered. We, on the other
hand, have simply accepted those
answers. We understand neither
what situations they were meant to
answer, nor why they were con-
sidered to be answers at all. We
really aren’t governing ourselves,
but are being governed by our pre-
decessors. ;
Reporting Violations

For instance, most of them
thought that drinking on the cam-
pus was a problem. Most of us will
go along with that. But they
thought that the answer to that
problem was to keep alcohol in any
form (either possession or consump-
tion) strictly off of the campus.
Many of us disagree.

The best way to do what they
wanted done was to expel offend-
ers, and the only way to do that
was to report violations of the rule.
Therefore most of them agreed to
report violations and even called it
their “duty” to do so. Now we do
not report violations (with notable
exceptions)..We even expect boys
not to accept this “duty” even
though it is in black and white.

Nevertheless we stupidly keep
the law on the books; nominally
holding that an alcohol-free cam-
pus is what we want, but really not
wanting to do the only thing to

keep it alcohol-free—i.e. report

violations.

The reason that such rules as the
drinking rules are flouted is that
they come down to us as answers
to problems that are not real to
us. For instance, we picture the
“drinking problem” very different-
ly than did our fathers. Yet, we as
a student body haven't squared off
with each other—some believing
that drinking is morally bad, and
some thinking that it is not a ques-
tion of morals, at all—and asking
“Shall we or shall we not control
ourselves on this matter? If so, how
shall we go about it?”

A Benign Despotism

If we did that, following the idea

of majority rule, then we would

become a self-governing body again.
As it is, we claim to be a democ-
racy when really we are under a
sort of benign despotism to rules
created by our fathers for them-
selves. .

What then is the answer? How do
we become self-governing again?
Well, it is not by just passively ac-
cepting the Student Council revi-
sion of the constitution. They cer-
tainly need to be revising it, but so
do wel If we just accept it, when
the new rules are not a real ex-
pression of the majority of this
student body, then we are advanced
not on whit in becoming democrat-
ic.

Rather, you've got to answer such
questions as these:

1) What areas of this communi-
ty’s life need to be controlled by
the whole community?—the drink-
ing habits of individuals? noise in
the dorms? cheating in studies?
scalping on your girl's football tic-
ket? ete...

2) What specifically am I willing
to give up for the community’s
well being?—private friendship?
practices sanctioned by my family?
the hurt of one boy for the better-
ment of many? etc. . .

3) How shall we carry out the
solutions we do decide on?—by
negative means such as the threat
of expulsion, fines or suspensions?
or by positive means such as indi-
vidual persuasion, influence and
exempliary action? or by combin-
ing both ways? etc...

The sooner we all start answer-
ing these questions, first individual-
ly and then as a group, the sooner
we will have student government
again. ;

This is a hard job. It is far easier
to pretend we can have “all this”
(i. e. letting everybody do as they
darn well please and being a good
Joe about it all) and “heaven too”
(i.e. a set of rules that looks like
democracy and are morally tidy to
boot).

It is harder to govern ourselves
than to be governed; that’s for sure.
The question is, is it not better?
Isn’t it. better in the same way it is
better for a thirty-five year old
adult to control himself rather than
to be controlled as he was when
he was two years old. Some of us
look like mature individuals. Now
let’s see if we can act like mature
individuals.

New “Spirit Of Extroverted Pessimism”

Galloping. Gripism
Hits Graggism Hard

BY DICK MOREHEAD AND JOHN FITE

(Gditor’s note: Mr. Morehead
and Mr. Fite here present a
stream-of-consciousness editorial!
peroding Mr. Gragg’s now old
“spirit of humble optimism.”
This essay attempts to illustrate,
by use of sterk realistic details,
how the “other half” of the Oa
vidson student body live. This
editorial is, in effect, an answer
to Graggism which has been slow-
ly sweeping the campus since its
inception last spring. Let’s look
in on the Davidson scene as they
trace @ morning from hangover
to chapel fiesta.)

The shrill sound of the alarm
clock shook me into pseudo-con-
sciousness Monday morning after
the irredeemable Spring Frolic's
blast had sunk into history. I was
lousier than usual, and the stab-
bing shafts of sunlight shot through
the window as I staggered toward
the half-cocked shade which was
still at half-mast in honor of the
nights before. I stumbled to the
beckoning basin to renew my ac-
quaintance with H20 and dismally
dreaded this dark day which dared
to dawn.

Breakfast

As I gaily walked to my break-
fast of Sugar Crisps, Puritan Puffed
Wheat, prune patties, and malted
maltese, with the sweet, fragant
yellow zephyrs of the alluding
April mourn carelessly caressing
my face, the lilting, Juxurious
blades of soft green grass nestling
seductively beneath my feet, and
the odious blue ozone over my

head, I felt a deep sense of jubi-.

lant joy for being alive (7) on this
disparaging day.

Slumping down in my chair an-
other student darkened my dol-
drums with a shrieking “Good
morning. Isn’t it a lovely day?”

My retort was slow and smoul-
dering: “Huh?”

Immediately came the backblast
“from the still small voice,” “Glor-
ious day, isn’t is? Glorious, simply
glorious, is it not?”

Mustering all energies: “H—,
no!” What's with this simple schitz?
Was he dating Monroe or Plato this
week-end? This square is strictly
from nowhere.

Having psychoanalyzed this
schmoo I once again regressed to
my fetal position when my spine
suddenly disentegrated beneath the
well-aimed blows of a pulverizing
paw and my ears fatally reverber-
eated to a blast from above:

To The Post Office

Finally reaching fresher air I
aimed my rotting ROTC ramblers,
regulation X-69-69, in the direction
of the United States Postal Receiy-
ing and Dispatching Depot. Upon
entering the pungent P. O. I en-
deavored to sort my miscellaneous
mail. After filing away my lawsuit
from the Religious Book Club, my
cut cards from last year, my free
soap coupons, my engraved invita-
tion from the Dean's receptionist,
and the Mudsink Hollow church
bulletin, I relaxed to note that the
folks were still unaware of the tra-
gic fate of the family car or of their
life’s savings formerly dedicated to
the education of their son.

Then the 33 claps from the Cham-
ber's carillon persistently announc-
ed the arrival of the voluntary
chapel fiesta. As I slunk into the
CinemaScopic setting with its
Panoramic pulpit and Stereophonic
sermons I was hoping that the
hymn would be “Are Ye Weary?
Are Ye Languid?” Instead, I was
greeted by the crashing crescendos
of “Joyful, Joyful.”

The sermon at last underway, I
reflected upon my morning in the
monastery, still seeking an answer
to the age old question: “What's
good about the morning?”

Riots, Disorder, And Noise Are

Student’s Favorite Diversions

No doubt you have heard or ev-
en been involved in current riots
and general disorder in some of the
dorms on the campus. Authorities
(seniors) say that the uprisings are
rapidly approaching the consumate
standards of misbehavior set by in-
famous amalgamations of the past.
Even though you might be familiar
with the incidents, perhaps a few
should be recorded, lest our posteri-
ty forget.

The inmates of Georgia have
arrived upon an innovation. The
more adventurous of that dorm
frequently have shaving cream
fights. Weapons are cans of com-
pressed shaving cream, usually
“Rise” or “Rapid Shave.” Occa-
sionally a few drops are spilted
here and there, but that doen't
dismay these leds. In fact, re-
cently, the fight became quite
violent and shaving cream was
smeared all over the stair well.
it inhanced the eppearance of
the dorm. The place looked as if
Piscasso might have done g mural
in green and white before he
turned cubist.

A favorite form of entertain-
ment is pillow fights. They some-
times develop into full scale wars,
involving nearly all the occupants
of a floor. Several nights ago, two
pillows burst, and the hall of 4th
floor West was covered with
a beautiful hoary carpet of feathers.
Unfortunately, all the feathers did
not find their way to the floor, for
two boys had to have feathers re-
moved from their lungs. The inci-
dent is of little consequence, how-
ever, as both happened to be “par.
ty” majors.

Water fights are considered to
rate very high on the “lists.”
Accepted containers include ev-
erything from Coke bottles to
waste baskets. The game Is usual-
ly played in this wise: a refpree
stands at the end of the hall and
calls out two room numbers.
The combatents, cled only in un-
derwear, sally forth from their
rooms to do battle. The object is
to see which can pour more wat-
er on his opponent. The fights
sometimes lead to very messy
floors, but thus far, the janitors,
not wanting to deprive the boys
of any fun, heave been coopera-
tive about cleaning up the water
ravaged dorms.

What the students enjoy most is
the jazz concerts, usually beginn‘ng
at 11:30 or 12:00 p.m. The trumpet
player lives in West and the trom-
bone player in Georgia. They play
whatever comes to mind, which is
usually a calvary charge, ‘“‘souppy,”
or reveille. The fact that both are
novices makes no difference, as
most of the pleasure is derived
from hearing loud noise. It must be
admitted that there are a few who
protest the unorthodox concerts.
Intermittantly they yell little ad-
monitions and warnings to the par-
ticipants, but they are only as one
tree in a forest.

Some of the witty members of
our Student Body enjoy making
conversation between the dorms,
Bast and West in particuler. The

conversents telk in an unintel-
ligable cant, and for that reason
few are able to participate in the
tremendous fun that it seems to
conjure. It appears that they
make jokes about some Julius or
somebody, but the language scho-
lors of the school, who have been
trying to decipher the verbal
code, have been able to make no
progress in the case.

The unique dormitory pastime is
a game named “Call Your Shot.” |
In this game there are four players,
each with a number 3 iron and a
golf ball. Having chosen a spot at
about the middle of the hall, one
of the four predicts which window
he will send his ball through. If his
ball goes through the chosen win.
dow, the other players must give
him a dime. (Freshmen have been
retrieving the balls). Then the oth-
er three must try to put their shots
where the first man put his, and if
they make it, the first man gives
each back his dime. The procedure
is repeated until all. the windows
on that particular floor are broken,

Letters To The Editor...

Court Of Control
Conduct Disgusting

Dear Editor:

The manner in which the Court
of Control was conducted last Fri-
day morning was nothing less than
disgusting! I know of no greater
campus farce than that of bringing
a freshman up before the Court on.
a charge of displaying conduct, ‘“un-
becoming to a Davidson gentle.
man,” and then having ‘the whole
student body display toward him
conduct unbecoming to the basest
sort of human being.

However, it is not just the con-
duct of specific Court meetings that
needs to be called to question, but
the entire time-honored practice of
calling a freshman up before the
student body to be charged with
violating a regulation.

This method of the court
smacks of the methods of that
most honorable Senator from
Wisconsin, who also has mode
the torture of being accused in-
finitely worse than any punish.
ment meted out eccording to the
rules of legal justice.

I am not qualified to say what
might be the effects of such an ex-
perience upon the more sensitive
of our first-year students: embar-
rassment for sure, perhaps feelings
of bitterness and cynicism, maybe
even more serious personality dis-
turbances, but I do feel strongly
that not even a meeting of the
Court of Control should provide
for Davidson College Christian gen-
tlemen an opportunity to show
mass disrespect for any individual
personality.

Sincerely yours,
Howard Wall

and then they move to another
floor. .

This game is constructive in that
it improves the player’s accuracy
in golf and, most important, it
helps ventilation, especially needed
on these hot nights.

Other Diversions °

There are other interesting
dorm diversions such as throw-
ing fire crackers out windows in
order to shock that prigg below
you, throwing toilet paper into
trees, séeing who can flush the
commode the most times in one
minute, hail football, and track,
which all adds up te “solid en
loyment”’ for the Davidson Stu-
dent. .

It is anticipated that some nar- -
row-minded reader will reprove
these activities by saying that they
are immature and inconsistent with
the term “Davidson Gentleman.”
The writer believes that no defense
is necessary, but he challenges the
sceptic with one demand: show us
one student who has a police rec-
ord.

A GLANCE AT DC
FROM THE OUTSIDE

The following is a letter from
Jim Kuist’s (by whose courtesy it
is used) mythical brother now in
prep schoo!. He has been reading
the Davidsonian and forming
ideas on student conduct.—Ed.

Dear Brother,

While ‘reading the Davidsonien
I was especially taken by the Stu-
dent Conduct Regulations on page
five. Gee, it must be good to live
at Davidson, where doing any-
thing bad is against the rules. Of
course, cheating, stealing, gam-
bling, lying, drinking and pets
should be against the rules. But
there's so much else! Damage, for
example. IL too, think that dam-
age should be a serious offense.
And using the college buildings
as stops for baseballs or tennis
balls could really be dangerous!

In some ways your rules are
like ours, only on a more mature
level. For instance, we can’t
smoke at all. We have to sign out
when we -take trips, too. And, like
you, we have to be careful about
what we wear. (By the way, what's
P-T-0-p.r-i-e-t-y?)

It is a healthy sign that you ore
all so proud of your school, its
name, and its reputation. You can
see that in your rules. Things like
being a gentleman, especially
around girls. That’s important.

I was kind of confused by this
matter of passing students back
and forth over your heads in as-
semblies, Do you usually do that?

I was sort of disappointed to see
a limit on parades.

That's about all. How are you?
I'm o. k.

Thanks again,
Your younger Brother
