Successful “Circus”... .

In their efforts-to publicize last
week-end’s social activities on -the
campus with girls from Salem and
Queens as guests, Shaw Smith and
company advertised that the events
would rival a three-ring circus. We
could hardly «classify the extrava-
ganza‘as a circus, for the only ani-
mals seen were a few wolves on the
loose, but the program was certainly
as entertaining.

Sceptical students opined that the
“Y” was trying to outdo itself in pro-
moting more and bigger campus
functions. They scoffed that lack of
organization would probably make a
faree of the whole idea. Such criti-
cism generally comes from those who
are so absorbed in the idea of ‘getting
away from the campus for the week-
end that they fail to realize that
there are some students, civilians as
well as soldiers, who get their only
social diversion from such campus
~activities. There are a few who re-
main on the campus that do not par-
ticipate either from lack of interest

in or from pure prejudice against

any activity sponsored ~by the
YMCA,

This criticism and lack of interest
on the part of some is wholly unjust-
ifiable. The many who have joined
in the spirit of these occasions have
expressed their whole-hearted.. ap-
proval.

The YMCA and other departments
of the college have a Herculean task
on their hands. In view of the pro-
hibition of the normal social outlet-—
the dance, they are doing their
utmost to provide other forms of en-
tertainment for the Air Crew stu-
dents as well as the regular college
students. We think they are doing
an excellent job. Someone comment-
ed that there must have been a lot
of praying done on Saturday to drive
away the threatening clouds and
provide such beautiful weather. But
Providence, alone, was not responsi-
ble for the success of the event. It
took long hours of planning and or-
ganization to put it across.

Sunday Activities ....

Students have long had strong
feelings against the ruling of the ad-
ministration prohibiting participa-
tion in any form of sports on the
campus on Sunday. When the local

law enforcement body was called.

upon last week-end to prevent any
such activities on the local athletic
fields, the storm of student protest
reached a new high. It was the last
straw.

We don’t like to draw a compari-
son between Davidson and prep
schools, but it has been pointed out
that at McCallie school in Chatta-
nooga, where religion is strongly em-
phasized and students’ activities
carefully controlled, the boys are
allowed to participate in sports on
the Sabbath. Rules with regard to
this subject have been relaxed some-
what there order to encourage
them to stay on the campus.

Yet with all of the college’s efforts
to get the students to spend their
week-ends here, they refuse them the
relaxation and exercise that an aft-
ernoon of play in the sun provides,
forcing them to seek this diversion
elsewhere.

We believe there should be more
of the element of personal conscience
in Sabbath observance on the campus
and less compulsion. There are many
Christian students on the campus

who can participate in wholesome,

non-commercialized athletics on Sun-
day without the least feeling of sin-
fulness. On the other. hand the ad-
ministration encourages students
not to study on Sunday, but. few pro-
fessors make allowances for this in
making assignments over the week-
end. Neither do they hire students
to check up and report students who
prepare Monday’s lessons on Sunday.
Is it not the same principle?

Dear Legh:

You may be interested in some ‘statistics that a
Davidson student made last year, the results of
Which were never published. He wanted to find
out whether a man has-a better chance of success
in life if he devotes his time to study while in
college and becomes the valedictorian, or if he
spends part of his time making contacts and be-
comes president of the student body. I am not
sure that the statistics prove what he set out to
prove for two reasons. Success is hard to defines
It may mean a life that is satisfactory to the
individual and have nothing to do with acclaim
from others. In the second place, the criterion
for was taken’ to be “Who's Who in
By no means would everyone agree

that all successful people are listed in that pub-
lication.

uccess
America.”

At any rate here are his results: Since 1895
When Dayidson first had both student body presi-
dent and a valedictorian, there. have been two of
the former in “Who's Who” and five of the latter.
One of the first two named was both president
of the student body and valedictorian, so he doesn’t
prove much except that he was a pretty outstanding
fellow. The results would seem to show that you
have four times as much chance of success in the
world if you are valedictorian than if you are
president of the student body.

I have an idea, however, that the same statis:
tics taken twenty years from now might be differ-
ent, since practically all the student body presi-
dents in recent years have also been at the top
scholastically.

I pass this on to you for what it is worth.

Sincerely yours,
Chalmers G. Davidson,
Director of the Library.
