Preview at Theatre

is

Students anxious for a preview
will be able to hear Long’s band

Thursday at the Broadway the-
atre in Charlotte. “Songs by Long”
seem to be quite popular with

Broadway patrons, who voted last
fall that the young maestro’s band
was their choice for a personal ap-
pearance in the theatre.

Left-handed Long is a native of
Charlotte, and members of his band
were chosen from among his class-
mates ‘at Duke University.

Featured singers with Long's
musicians will be Helen Young,
radio songstress; Jack Edmondson,
song stylist;; Paul Harmon, bari-
tone; and “Swede” Nielson, come-
dian.

Smooth Music
Long is noted for his smooth

style of playing. Although it is said
that he often plays pieces that are
on the “hot” he is chiefly in-
terested in smooth music. It is in
the smooth variety that the Long
aggregation achieves the unsual ef-
fects for which it is noted.

_ Avoids Injury
ieee Firer, Misses Aim
At Paul S. Crane

It seems that the students at Da-
vidson are livin in constant dang- |
er of having their lives suddenly
taken from them one of these first
spring days. At ‘least, that is the
startling opinion that, Paul S. Crane
of the Junior class nw has.

Last Sunday, Paul was allegedly
} studying at his desk in Rumple

| dormitory when a. shot was heard

| by said student. A bullet promptly
| entered the window leaving a small
in’ the glass—horribly
indicative of its potentially de-
structive velocity. It whizzed past
his head about a foot away and
burried itself in the wall. It was
evidently fired from the road out-
-the northern exposure of
Rumple.

There are absolutely no clues as
to who the malicious marauder
could be and Paul states
can't think of any one who could
possibly want him removed from
this earth. Heré is afforded an ex-
cellent opportunity for ambitious
amateur detectives to try out their
skill as possible Sherlock Holmes
or Philo Vances and it would un-
doubtedly be a great relief to Paul
Crane who lives with the shadow
of death over his head.
