Bouquets are due the cindermen for opening the
sports session with a conference win. Coach Whittle, fearful of |
too luxurious 4a holiday among members of the cinder squad,
merely deepened his frown when he saw star-hurdler Arch Tay- |
lor smoking a new pipe on Friday before the meet Saturday.

3ut by the next afternoon all Pete’s frowns were gone, and
he was justly proud of his boys, although still a little doubtful
is to how human bodies were able to function in such a fashion.
Pipe-smoker Taylor took first scoring honors with two firsts
ind a second, which might well have been anothyr win, had he |
1ot tangled with the first hurdle in the 220 lows and_fallen, |

Chase Brenizer’s 22’ 4 1-2" were away out in the broad jump,
and another first in the javelin with a second place tie on the
high jump gave him second scoring honors with 12 points.
Sophomore John Belk surprised the spectators as well as his
coach by returning directly from a
away in the home stretch of the S80 and cop a first just after,
clearing 5’7” to top the high jumpers |

Lacy runs the low hurdles, 100

jumps. Other leading candidates are
Pat Williams, the high
hurdles, high jumps, and puts the
shot. Dick O’Hair, who pole vaults
