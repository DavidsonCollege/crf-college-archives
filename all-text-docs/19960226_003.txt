The endowment — how do we compare?

Davidson funds rank low in size, hi

By Brap D. Cuase

One of the main things that
any college relies upon for funding
is anendowment. Davidson, how-
ever, has one of the smallest en-
dowments for a college its size.

Out of ten other “peer” col-
leges that Davidson compares it-
self to, Davidson ranks near the
bottom in actual size of endow-
ment.

_Endowments arise from finan-
cial gifts to the college that are then
invested in a wide variety of areas,
including stocks and bonds. Two-
‘thirds of the Davidson Endowment
is classified as restricted, which
means that the initial investment
must always remain in the endow-

ment and that any growth must be
applied to certain areas at the col-
lege, such as basketball or a music
program.

The Davidson endowment
provides for about 16% of each
year’s operating budget, translat-
ing into a little over $7 million of
next year’s $45 million budget.
Although this is’a substantial
amount of the budget, it lags be-
hind other colleges its size.

Incomparison, more than two-
thirds of next year’s budget will
come from tuition and fees paid by
students.

If the endowment was larger,
it would be possible to lower tu-
ition while still providing the same
services.

Although the Davidson En-°

dowment is smaller than other
schools its size, it also has the
second highest growth rate, be-
hind only Swarthmore College.

The Endowment is currently
valued at $163 million partly due
to an impressive 19.4% return on
its investment last year.

Out of 460 public and private
universities in the United States,
Davidson ranks 133 inendowment
size, which means that 71% of
schools have less money in en-
dowments than Davidson.

When the endowment is bro-
ken down on a per student basis,
Davidson ranks 65th out of 308
private colleges and universities,
meaning that it ranks higher than
79% of institutions in the U.S.

Robert Norfleet, Vice Presi-

dent of Business and Finance says
that “the figures are misleading
when you compare [the endow-
ment] with our ‘peer’ group of
institutions. We do rank behind
them, but all in all we are in good

Shape.” He added, “Of course, we

always want to be better.”

The Davidson Endowment is
divided into three principle areas.
Two-thirds of the endowment is
invested in equities, another 25%
in fixed income areas, and the re-
mainder in real estate.

The investing is monitored
three times a year by the Trustees
and receives an internal evaluation
every 90 days.

Norfleet explained, “The
Trustees of the College have cho-
sen to invest in a wide variety of

gh in growth rate

areas, but they were also,careful to
avoid areas that are volatile.”

He also says that last year
“guidelines were put into place to
avoid security derivative invest-
ments and ultimately to avoid
[problems].”

Norfleet added, “I wish that
we would have had more money in
the 1980s. Many other schools
were able to triple their endow-
ments during that time, which we
did also, but they were dealing
with a substantially higher endow-
ment to begin with.”

He also says that the College
“wants to make the most of the
endowment in the years to come so
that tuition does not have to be
raised.”

Images of

injustice in Israel:
Speaker Smith will take

students to Middle
East this summer

By ANN HATFIELD

Staff Writer

Monday night Dean Rusk
speaker Mary-Lou Smith shared
her recent experiences in Israel.
Smith explained that she had al-
ways been interested in and de-
voted to peace issues, but that her
recent trip “was a life-changing
experience.”

June 5-19, she plans to lead a
trip of Davidson, Duke and UNC
students to Israel. so they can share
her experiences.

She says, “I want to spread
understanding about the conflict
between Israel and Palestine and
share the Palestinian side of the
issue.”

Smith began her discussion
and slide show by asking the audi-
ence to describe their conceptions
of Palestinians.

She then explained that her
own initial conception was in-
formed and shaped by her Judeo-
Christian heritage.

During her trip, however,
Smith was shocked by the injus-
tices that Palestinians suffered and
distressed by the effects of the 29
year occupation.

Smith believes that the Sep-
tember peace accord between Is-
raeli and Palestinian factions pro-
vides aunique opportunity for com-
promise.

Smith’s last slide showed a
plea borrowed from a Palestinian
school: “Co-operation is better than
conflict.”

She calls her trip a pilgrimage
to the holy land and hopes that
those involved “gain a deeper un-
derstanding of the conflict with its
social, religious, and economic

implications ... I want students to
play an active part in promoting
peace and understanding.”

The trip seeks to illuminate
the views of both factions empha-
sizing “cultural sensitivity, con-
flictresolution, contemporary con-
text of Christian mission, and the
rudiments of Islam and Judaism.”

Spots are still available for
interested students, but they must
notify chaplain Rob Spach -2420
or Bill Felty -2132 of their interest
before Spring Break.
