U.

1 feel that the purpose of any
Yood college magazine is: first,
to provide humorous, entertain-
ing material especially relevant
to the college by which it is
sponsored: second, if no other
outlet is available, to provide a
medium through which student
writers may display their tal-
ents.

Before anyone becomes in-
Tlicted with notions that the
above is my platform in running
for editor of Scripts ‘n Pranks,
1 would like to very quickly and
very thoroughly remove one of
the planks.

H «lected. I would publish an
exclusively humor magazine:.
this is because the administra-
tion has agreed to relieve
Scripts n’ Pranks of its second
responsibility by providing the
funds for an additional publica-
tion of a more serious nature.

By humorous I don’t mean the
comic as opposed to the liter-
ary. I feel quite strongly that
good, original humor has a high
degree of literary value. Excel-
lent college magazines. such as
the Harvard Lampoon and the
Texas Ranger, are of such a
character. There are several
seasons why I think that Scripts
‘n Pranks could make the con-
version to humor without too
much difficulty.

For instance, a good humor
magazine must have certain
humorous’ characteristics to
which the reader may look for-
ward from issue to issue. A
start at this has been made with
the character, Ches R. Cat, al-
though I feel that Ches R. could
use guite a bit of refinement.

Most important. I feel that
the. student body at Davidson
wants a good humor magazine.
In the past. serious literary
works have all too often been
used as fillers rather than as
qualitative -additions to the ma-
gazine. An edition of Seripts ‘n
Pranks of a few years back car-
ried the following cover ‘title:
“Kterary (and budget)  is-
sue"...

NEWCOMER

Duncan Newcomer, a
history major from Shaw-
nee Mission. Kan.. is a
Beta and is vice-president
of the Eumanean Liter-
ary Society. He has been
awarded a Patterson con-
tributory scholarship, and
plans to enter the minis-
try.

Like ‘‘urging a luncheon com-
panion to accept a cool lima
bean” I sav make me editor of
Scripts ‘n Pranks.

The writers on campus will
hesitate to do so for they know
J am no writer. The non-writers
on campus will hesitate. for
they are non-readers too and
have not passed the picture-book
stage, A cool lima bean differs
little to them from any other
kind of lima bean.

Suddenly, therefore, the read-
ers of this menu are reduced to
a handful of connoisseurs, a cult
of writers. To that cult I say the
Scripts ‘a Pranks will be worth

jor from Rockingham. A

Did you ever take time to
analyze the composition of the
picture in LIFE of Jacqueline
Kennedy at the President's fun-
eral, or to ponder the signific-
ance of the words, “I am the
greatest,": appearing under a
SPORTS ILLUSTRATED phaoto-
graph of “the Mouth’?

You probably didn’t because
you. didn't need to—the fusion
of picture and words was vibrant
on the page—it conveyed its
message without requiring exa-
mination for deeper meaning.

Such fusion is essentially the
purpose of an annual editor: to
integrate expressive copy with
animated photography in the
most compatible combination.
This will convey in turn the
purpose of the college annual: to
be a synoptic reflection of the
personalities, actions, thoughts,
achievements, and failures dur-
ing the collegiate year. ©

To produce such a pictorial
history as this will require ex-
perience, imagination, planning.
and much hard work.

Having served two years as
assistant to the classes editor
and this year as. editor of the
Activities section, I feel I am
capable of producing the blend
of know-how, initiative, originali-
ty. experience and imagination

necessary to turn out an annual
that completely depicts our con-
tribution to the Davidson Story.

Through contact with prob-
lems and possibilities of annual-
creating and association with
other section editors, I have
formulated my own tastes for
the composition of an annual. As
examples, I would prefer to con-
tinue the informal faculty sec-
tion. I believe that this is the
way we really remember our
mentors—their quips and their
cranks.

In addition to regular sports
coverage, I advocate some at-
tention to minor sports which
give more to Davidson than a
posed g¢roup picture would indi-
cate. Color adds unlimited beau-
ty and interest to an annual.
However. color should be added
discretely and economically. I
propose the continuation of the
four-page fraternity spread in
order to fully portray the posi-
tion of our fraternities in pro-
portion to what they give and
demand from student life.

For the activities section. I
would continue the informal
presentation for most of the
organizations in order to clearly
p'cture them as they exist. In-
formality here gives excellent
contrast to formality in the
honoraries section.

With the help of an industrious
staff of section editors writers.
and photographers. p'us your
support for my ability and pur-
pose to edit the 1965 QUIPS
AND CRANKS. I belleve these
and other plans and designs may
be realized. I seek this support
through your vote.

forts, en casserole.

I propose to cultivate the cult.
(They're the ones who recogniz-
ed the opening quote as Salin-
ger's introduction to Franny and
Zooey.) As Chief-editor I will be
a “lover of the long shot. pro-
tector of the unprolific, defender
of the hopelessly flamboyant. . "

Cary Eaton, a chemistry
major from Camden, S. C.,
is a photographer for Quips
and Cranks. He is member
of Sigma Phi Epsilon and of
Philanthropic Literary So-
ciety.

In this platform I do not wish
to be explicit on details of the
yearbook: rather I wish to ex-
plain in concise form those
general ideas about the publica-
tion of an annual that I would
follow if elected Editor.

Photography, of course, is
central in any yearbook. A good
annual by its very nature must
contain a wide variety of high
quality pictures. As Assistant
Photographer for Quips and
Cranks this year I feel uniquely
qualified. to handle this all-im-
portant phase of the yearbook.
The planning and arrange-
ment of photographs can best
be achieved by an Editor-Photo-
grapher since he is familiar with
both the graphical ideas and the
technical aspects of a picture.
A thorough knowledge of these
requirements will greatly facili-
tate the work of the Section
Editors and, most important.
that of the staff photographers.

If elected I will seek variety
in pictures. I will attempt to
avoid the commonplace picture
and to accent the original and
the unusual. At the same time.
equal emphasis will be placed
on print quality and pleasing
composition.

Through the integration of
photography and prose I will
strive to capture the identity of
each class. Naturally I will con-
centrate to some degree on the
Class of 1965 and its distinct
personality and achievements.

If elected to the Editorship of
Quips and Cranks, I will make
an honest effort to obtain a
representative sampling of stud-
ent life at Davidson. Such a
sampling will include more than
a mere treatment of official
campus. organizations. It will
also encompass the more infor-
mal aspects of the school year
which are an integral part of
campus life.

I feel that there is a definite
place for humor in an annual,
though it should not be over-
emphasized. I will attempt to
strike a proper balance between
the humorous and more serious
facets of the college.

In sum, I feel qualified to
handle the position of Editor and
would appreciate the opportuni-
ty to publish a Quips and Cranks
that will prove meaningful to
the students both as an immed-
iate account of the 1964-65 col-
lege year and as a permanent
chronicle of the life and tradi-
tions at Davidson. °

1318 W. Morehead

tory major from Richmond,
Va. A member of Sigma
Chi, McIver has served as
faculty section editor and
classes editor of Quips and
Cranks.

As a candidate for editor of
Quips and Cranks, there are
several things I would strive to
carry out, if elected.

1. The yearbook has one sole
purpose: to give an accurate,
interesting. and complete ac.
count of the school year. As
editor, I would keep this pur-
pose in mind and at the same
time incorporate originality,
variation, and Mlexibility to make
the book as interesting as pos-
sible to the student.

2. Pictures are the backbone
of a good yearbook. If the pic-
tures are not up to par and if
they don’t. adequately tell the
story of the school year, then
the whole yearbook suffers. As
editor, I would try in every way
to keep the excellent quality of
pictures maintained in previous
yearbooks. I would use as many
color pictures as the budget per-
mits, and I would use drawings
and art work whenever possible.

3. When the student thumbs
through a yearbook, he seldom
reads the copy. However the:
copy in a yearbook has its im-
portant place, and as editor TI
would keep the copy as inter:
esting, complete, and brief as
possible. Also, I would try in
every way to do away with mis-
spelled names both in captions
and in the copy.

4. I would work closely with
the business manager during the
year and would always stay
within the limits of the budget.

5. I would be opened to any
student suggestion or criticism
on anything concerning the year-
book, and I believe that a con-
tact should be maintained be-
tween the yearbook staff and the
student body throughout the
year. |

6. If elected. I would fulfill my
duties as editor to the best of
my ability.
