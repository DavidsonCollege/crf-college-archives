AS THE ‘ATHLETIC
EDITOR SEES IT

BY RAYMOND LAKE

The recent announcement of the ‘vradical
change which the famed Knute Rockne in-

tends to make in the line-up of his backfield
next fall must be creating quite a bit of
interest among gridiron stars of the country,
especially those. who will meet up with the,
new formation, or shift, in actual battles on |
the gridiron. It seems that Rockne plans to
have his backfield men turn their backs to
the line and go through all their shifts in
this position, then at a certain signal to
wheel around just as the ball is snapped and
execute the play.. This, of course, will
greatly lessen the amount of “pointing” by |
the backfield men,and will’ make it almost |
impossible for opposing backs to determine
where a play is going before it is executed.

|

|

When the “crazy quilt” formation was |
first used, it succeeded to a certain extent in
confusing the opposing players, but this new
shift, it seems to us, should prove quite a|
bit more successful along this line. Imagine
the confusion of a group of players at seeing
their opposing back shifting around into
various positions with their backs turned,
and then suddenly wheeling and plowing |
toward them. Of course, the plays will have

have been kept secret and then used on teams

what the result would be for a while. Even |
though Notre Dame’s opponents’ do work on |
the shifts and reduce their effect to a mini-
mum, it will be interesting to see what they
will accomplish next year.

The Wildcats were able last fall to down
the Duke University Blue Devils in football
without a terrible amount of work, but when
it comes to-baseball, we’ll have to hand it to
them thig'year. They came out victorious in
two straight games with the home team,
winning the last encounter by «a one-sided
11 to 1 score. The Blue Devil track team,
too, is unusually good this year. They beat
Wake Forest quite a bit worse than the
Wildcats did, and, if we trust comparative
scores, should be able to win over the Wild-
cats next Saturday. Comparative scores,
however, are a poor criterion to judge by,
especially when the Wildcats are concerned
and the odds are against them. e old
Wildcat Spirit has won too many battles
against overwhelming odds and has caused
too many upsets. in the minds of those who
trust to comparative scores, :

The Wildkittens are showing up good both
on the track and the diamond. There is
plenty of good material out ‘for both teams,
and, although the baseball team has lost
several games, they have shown good form
and deserve praise for their work. The
track’team has won both of its meets, and
promises to furnish some, valuable men to
the varsity next year. The first meet, with
Catawba, was, of course, more of a practice
meet, but the last meet, with Bingham was
no “crip,” and the Freshmen did well to
tome out on the long end of the score.

Once more the Wildcats were forced to bow

before the Tar Heels. Last year the annual

battle at Salisbury was very colorful and
not until the last inning did the Tar Heels
even threaten to take the game. This year,
however, -the story was a very different one.
The Wildcats, for some reason, were not
able to “get going,”and were able to bring
in only one run to six for their opponents.
»Alarge crowd attended the game, but there
was none of the usual cheering,and many of
the spectators left before the game was more
than two-thirds over. Only once during the
game did the Wildcat rooters show any signs
of possessing the usual Wildcat Spirit.

In spite of the fact that the usual spirit
was lacking, Duling played a wonderful
game from start to finish. He was the only
man who was able to score for the Wildcats,
and his work in the field was equally as
good as his work at bat.

a single base on balls. |

Kirkley led in hitting for the visitors, se- |
curing two of their four hits with a three- |
bagger and a homer, and scoring both of |
their runs. .Joe McConnell was the heaviest
hitting Wildcat, getting two blows out of
three trips to the plate; he was followed
closely by Johnny Dulin, who secured three
hits out of fivé attempts. The Wildcat team,
on the whole, hit well, getting 12 hits.

The fielding of the Wildcat players was
very good as compared -with"that of the
Wofford men, the Methodists committing six
errors while the Wildcats had only one
chalked up against them.

Varsity Net Team
on Extensive Trip

On Monday night the Davidson College
varsity tennis team left on the most extensive
tour of any team which has ever represented

this school. This team will represent Da-
vidson at the State Tournament at Chapel
Hill on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday,
and then leave for their Northern trip. The
date for the State Tournament was moved
up one day in order that the Davidson team
might enter. The men making the trip are:
McCutcheon, Carr, Roddey and McAlpine.
The former two are thé present doubles
champions of North Carolina and have a fine
chance of retaining this coveted title. Duke
University is supposed to have the strongest
team in the state and is expecting to carry
off a major portion of the honors. All the
Davidson men will give keen opposition in
the singles, and the doubles team will do its
part.

On the Northern tour the first team to be
met will be the one representing the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania. This match will be
played on Friday at Philadelphia. The next
match will be with the team of ‘the Bethle-
hem Moravian College of Pennsylvania.
This school is known to have a very strong _
team, as tennis is the only inter-collegiate
sport in which they participate. The follow-
ing week Colgate and Cornell Universities
will be met and a match with George Wash-
ington is pending.

This team promises to be one of the best
that h4$ ever represented Davidson, and a
lot is expected of them. McCutcheon, Carr
and McAlpine have already won. their letters
in this sport, and Roddy has demonstrated
his ability while playing on last year’s Fresh-
man team. In the only match this year, with
Furman the Davidson team won an over-
whelming victory, losing only one match out
of six.

more sympathetic attitude, and permission to
work out their own problems alone.
O’Neal’s speech, “Caterpillar Commun-
ism,” was the presentation of a theoretical
social system, and a plea for more co-opera-
tion and, understanding between men in over-
coming difficulties between capital and labor.
He compared such a system to a certain
species of caterpillars, which live and work
together harmoniously, without fraction and
misunderstanding. ;
