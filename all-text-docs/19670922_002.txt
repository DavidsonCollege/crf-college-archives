No Solution

For offering some alternative to the
local fraternity presidents’ social affil-
liation plan, the national fraternity of-
ficers who drew up the Estes Park
resolution deserve some credit.

At least they were being tactful.
Instead of openly rejecting the possi-
bility of improving the Greek situa-
tion here. they shrouded their rejec-
tion in a resolution that just fails to
accomplish the same goals that the
fraternity presidents were aiming for.

While the one week eating privilege
proposed by the nationals is certainly
a much betier rush technique than the
usual party method, it does not answer
the problem that the fraternity presi-
dents tried to answer last year. While
the nationals may be right in saying
that the student plan aimed at formal
membership for the rushee who did
not originally receive a bid for broth-
erhood, they do not understand the
importance of the social affiliate sta-
tus that the locals were going to of-
fer. .

One wonders at the national fra-
ternities’ refusal to recognize the sta-
tus of the social affiliate. It almost
seems that they fear more, rushees
would be interested in social .affilia-
tion than in brotherhood. While it is
unlikely that the local fraternities
would care to operate with most of
their “members” being social affili-
ates instead of brothers, at least they
are confident about their ability to
persuade rushees to want brotherhood
instead of affiliate status. It-is hard
to see why the nationals are so ada-
mant in their objections to affiliation
unless they themselves lack this con
fidence.

In fraternities that do not constitu-
tionally recognize affiliate status, the
prohibition is more honored. in the
breach than in the observance. A sur-
vey of individual chapters of one such
fraternitv. last spring. turned up doz-
ens of affiliates. Once again it seems
that the members’ local chapters have
less to fear from associating with a
non-brother than doves the. national
office.

One reason for this may be the fact
that the local chapter knows more
about the conditions prevailing at its
schoo! than does the national. Per-
haps on the large university campus
where fraternity membership seems
to offer exceptional benefits, an affil-
iation plan might be disastrous. There
the fraternity house offers a small
group association that stands in com-

fortable contrast to the impersonal
university campus. Perhaps it is this
large campus orientation that pre-
vents /national offices from seeing the
peculiar situation at a small college.

At the small college the fraternity
has something of a different purpose
than at the large university. When the
fraternity system includes as much of
the college family as it does at David-
son, it has greater responsibilities for
the welfare of the campus.

At the same time, the system's pres-
ent importance gives it strength to
deal with the problems. facing it and
the college. It does not have to go in-
to paranoid fits at the mention of
change.

The Estes Park resolution points
out something that some fraternity
members had begun to see last year.
At that time there was some talk
about the way that the national office
restricts the freedom of the local
chapter to work constructively _ to-
wards improving its own situation.
Only one of the fraternities with Da-
vidson chapters offers any real degree
of local autonomy. The other cling
to their locals like’ a mother that is
afraid to see her son grow up.

It would be a terrible disappoint-
ment if Davidson and her Greeks are
not allowed to find a rea} solution to
the social system here. If the locals
and the college can push on to solve
the problem of the non-bid student
who wishes to be a part of the frater-
nity system. perhaps they can also
succeed in achieving some measure of
freedom for the Greeks.

Good Job

Change always presents new prob
lems. Davidson's attempt at computer-
ization of its registration and record-
keeping is no exception to this rule.

But the listing of these problems
should not be interpreted as a slap at
Associate Dean of the Faculty and
Registrar J. H. Ostwalt, the man who
has led the change-over.

In past years the job of registrar
was considered to be a full-time job.
This year the task of aiding Dean of
the Faculty Frontis W. Johnston was
added. On top of that came the im-
mense job of leading the expansion of
computer use by the college.

All of this has fallen into Ostwalt’s
hands. The job that he has done
proves that those hands are both tire-
less and capable.

Of Chins And Policy

Just because the chin of Rep.
George Brown (D.-Cal.) bears a strong
resemblance to President. Johnson s
chin does not mean the. rest of their
heads are similar.

Yesterday’s assembly, speech gave
ample proof of the fact that the th'nk-
ing parts of their heads do not agree.
Brown's stand against the war in Viet
nam clashed directly with that of
Johnson. The roar of applause that
greeted Brown’s call for the U.S. to
get out of the war indicates that there
are a lot of Davidson students who
do not agree with Johnston’s thinking
either.

One wishes that Brown could have
presented in the assembly some plan
for accomplishing his goals. With so
much of the U.S. population against
the war, the issue of the means of
withdrawal is almost more of a con-
troversy than the argument over
whether or not the war should con-
tinue.

As has happened before in the U.S.
attempt to stop communism, it has
put itself in the position of supporting
a harsh regime of thinly concealed
dictatorship. The U.S. has come a long
way in realizing that there are many
different types of social evil on the
domestic scene. However. this countrv
lacks the same perception in world
affairs. It seems that our policy mak-
ers are determined to believe that the
only evil that matters in world affairs
is that of communism. They have at
least come to realize that they cannot
jump all of their fears into the idea of
a world communist plot, but they still
do not seem to realize that there are
some other threats in the world at
least as bad as they imagine commun-
ism to be.

One of those evils is the manipula-
tion of other countries. Certainly it
would be nice if there could be some
source of order in the world, and the
U.S. should to contribute to the
search for such order. But this coun-
try has no right to be the policeman

of the world. While it may well offer
the most progressive society to be
found in the world, its record does
not justify any sort of claim that it
has all or even most of the answers
to the world’s problems.

_A directive commonly heatd by Da-
vidson ROTC students at summer
camp is, “Even if you don’t know
what you are doing, act is if you do.”
That may be a good way for an army
officer to give his men the confidence
they need fo get through a rough sit-.
uat‘on. It is not. however. a good way
to run foreign policy if it leads the
government to a bleief in its own in
fallibility.

President Johnson might have been
able to have a respectable term of of-
fice if he had not faced any sort of
major problems during his time. He
is probably no more incompetent than
many other men who have held the
Presidency. But he got stuck with an
awfully bad time to be President, and
he simply is not able to handle the
Vietnam situation.

The arguments that are mouthed to
just‘fy that very messv war sound
more hollow every time thev are re-
peated b- the government. There are
Ievitimate concerns that prevent the
U.S. from burving its head in the sand
or flitting off on an LSD trio of ir-
responsibilitv. The consideration of
these factors prevents any simple call
to pull out. Tragic consequences
would result jf the U.S. announced to-
morrow. “O.K. fellows, forget it. Come
on home.” The present regime would
probablv become even harsher.

But the results of not seeking neace
at every step of the march will be
even more tragic. Although George
Brown may not have the answer to
the question of just how we should
get out, an increased number of Con-
gressmen who share his earnest de-
sire for peace might be able to get
the U.S. out of the mess into which it
has stepped.

FROM PAKISTAN WITH LOVE

Pakistan Is Old, Young

By NAIM AHMED
Richardson Scholar

Pakistan is an irony. Polit-
ically, it is one of the young-
est nations. Histofically, it’ is
one of the most ancient lands
known to man.

When independence came in
1947 Hindus outnumbered the
Moslums in the subcontinent
by the ratio of five to one.
Freedom from British rule
for the Muslims would have
been meaningless had they
also not got freedom from a
menacing Hindu majority. As
harmony between them could
not be achieved the idea of
a separate homeland for the
Muslims was brought for
ward.

This idea of Pakistan was
opposed tooth and nail by the
Hindus. But one people. be
lieving that. “‘life is not so
sweet and peace so dear as
to be purchased at the cost
of chains of slavery’ made
untold sacrifices and Pakis-
tan (now a nation of 100 mil
lion) came into being on Au-

gust 14. 1947. The areas
where Muslims were in a
majority were to form Pak-
istan and Hindu majority
areas were to constitute In-
dia.

Ours is a federation of two
states -East and West Pakis.
tan, divided by 1.000 miles
of Indian territory. If India
stops us from flying over
their country (which they
have been doing). it takes 7
hours in a Boeing jet to go
from West to East Pakistan —
like flying from Paris to New
York!

But the only thing that
unites Pakistanis is a com-
mon faith. The very reason
for the country’s existence is
devotion to Islam. Neverthe-
less. the missionaries of oth-
er religions are free to oper-
ate. From my childhood to
my graduation. I have stud-
ied in Christian missionary
schools.

Thus Pakistan is an Ide.
ological nation; unique in
the sense that it came into
existence on the basis of a

Psychiatrist Tells
People Play Life

EDITOR’S NOTE: This
book review witl run bi-
weekly, reviewing books
either available or on order
at The Student Store. This
week's book is Games Peo-
ple Play, by Eric Berne,
M.D., Delt Paperback,
$1.25.

By SAM DARBY
Feature Writer

It seems to me that when
ever anyone undertakes 1o
write 4 column he has a wide
range of material from whi¢gh
he can draw. And although
this is going to be a bi
monthly book review by me
and Smyth, we see no rea
son to limit ourselves to a
strict book review every
week; not only would it be
boring to read, but: it would
also get very tedious to write.

So we have decided to be
as crafty as we can and in
between passages of serious
critical analysis we are going
to try to pass on any pertin-
ent observations which we
deem helpful to our dear
readers’ striving for self
realization.

The title of this column
was chosen by lottery and
though it is purely ufflltar-
ian, one may feel free to
attach any = significance
which he choses. We would
be the last to squeich a
creative spirit.

Enough intreduction. The
subject at hand is a book by
Dr. Eric Berne entitled
Games People Play. This
man is a practicing psychia
trist [rom California who has
made -an_ extensive study
of “transactional analysis”
which he published in a more
scholarly work called Trans-
actional Analysis in Psycho
therapy.

This book is a sort of se.
quel, but at the same time
a “‘hayman’s edition’ of that
text. If you have read the
review from the (London)
Times Literary Supplement.
you will know that their re-
viewer said that “by no
Stretch of the imagination
can the book be regarded as
‘a contribution to psycholog.
ical or psychiatric theory.
Jargon and dogma are no
substitute for the rigor we
expect. from a_ scientific
theorist.”

Whoever wrote that failed
to understand that the book
was not written for scientists
but for regular people who
would like some insight into
things that they do every day
but have never stopped to
consider.

And one thing that can be
gotten from this book, in
fact the most tmportant
thing about the book, is that
it does lend insight into what
Dr. Berne calls “Life Games”
as well as simple “‘transac-
tions."’

For instance, he takes as
his basic assumption that in
order to maintain what is
evidently a precarious psy-
chiatric balance. we human
beings are continually man
euvering ourselves into
Positions in which we may
be “stroked.”

“Stroking” is a thing which
we all need, and as we grow
up its form changes from
Physical caresses to verbal
compliments and symbolic
actions. When we are recog

religion. Yet, non-Mustims

can rise to high offices.

One chief justice is a Chris-

tian.

Poor as one country is, we
have to spend more than 50
per cent of our GNP on de-
fense due to the constant
threat from India. The bone
of contention is Kashmir—a
valley of 3% million people
which is predominantly Mus-
Him and thus should have
gone to Pakistan on the prin-
ciple of partition.

The UN had decided that
there will be a plebiscite in
Kashmir and the people will
be given their right of self-
determination to say whether
they wanted to join India or
Pakistan. Yet, India now re-
fuses to hold a plebiscite.

Thus, we feel that ulti.
mately we may well have to
be the determiners of our
own destiny. After all, it’ is
not the will of providence that
the victims of injustice and
aggression should have no
higher court of appeal than
the UN.

Berne says that this. is a
form of stroking necessary
to our psychic well being.
And furthermore he does not
rationalize it for us, which
is very disturbing when you
think about it. : .

Things like this are not
called ‘“‘games,”’ however.
The title of the book comes
from the very complex sys-
tem of maneuvers. which
people assume in order to
gratify their very real neéd

Criticism Advocated

ears now the Davidson College campus
has fottered vvhat may be safely called an homogenous
student body. Admittedly the trend seems now to be
toward a sort of diversification of student backgrounds
and attitudes which is being achieved primarily through
admissions acceptance with regards to geographical

distribution.

‘art of this varying in background may be due to
the Cidening reputation of Davidson and part to a
conscious attempt by the admissions office to be able
to say each year that we are becoming less regional.
If there is such an attempt it could be one good means
of starting a real program of student body diversifica
tion, but it is far from sufficient in itself. It seems more
like attempts made by certain colleges at token inte:
gration,” in that having so many Northerners and
Westerners each year is like trying for just so many
Negroes and no more. But still it is a start.

In a college with such a high percentage of high
school class presidents and ex-Eagle Scouts among its
students, there is bound to be an almost equally high
percentage of yes-men in its ranks, that is, men who
are accustomed to conforming, if not to the will of
administrative powers, to that of their peers. This is
where our few showcase intellectuals and/or weirdos
are useful—to provide a little friction every now and
then as.a counterbalance to the general feeling of
satisfied complacency that could easily come to char-
acterize Davidson.

But this token number of unusual or_non-typical
students is too small to be significantly heard or felt
in daily affairs. An occasional stomping out of chapel
or the harassment of the ROTC department on inspec-
tion days is noticed but it is as much reflected upon.
in the long run, as the weekly unread letter to the
editor.

What is not particularly needed is an imported
ratio of campus weirdos to provide amusement for the
rest of us during an otherwise boring term—what is
needed to keep Davidson inching away from the 19th
century is a general feeling of criticism, of reflection,
and even.of dissent on the part of the laziest, but poten-
tially the most powerful force on campus, the Average.
Student. :

For most of us it is (60 Tate to begin criticizing—
it would require. too much energy, both physical and
mental. But even among the seniors there are still a
few who either haven't completely adopted the normal
attitude of indifference or who have passed through
the “I don’t give a damn” stage-to giving very much
of a damn—not only about Davidson's faculty and ad-
ministration but also about themselves and their own
education.

The fact that there are a few of these Average
Students at Davidson who are concerned about the
school and themselves indicates that there can be more.
Hopefully there are more than usual in the freshman
class, but as this is a hope which proves futile each .
year, maybe we should ask that those Average Students
among the freshmen who feel from time to time in dis-
agreement with what they find at Davidson not try to
justify it or forget it, but instead that they let someone
know that they have a gripe.

In the end, a little constructive criticism from
many can obtain far greater and quicker results than
intensive dissent from a few. This year then, in the
name of progress, come, let us bitch together.

Northwestern Halts Discrimination

By Collegiate Press Service

Northwestern University’s
Student Senate has acted to
halt discrimination by frater-
nities and sororities.

After lengthy debate. the.
Senate adopted a resolution
instituting procedures for in-
vestigation of racial or re-
ligious discrimination during
this fall's rush.

Any evidence revealing and
substantiating rush bias will
be submitted to the school's ;
Council on Undergraduate
Life (CUL), which may then
act to suspend the rush pro
grams of the Greek organi-
zations in question or expel
the houses from the campus.

Included in the resolution
is a request to the Dean of

Students that incoming fresh.
men ‘be informed of the pol-
icy and of their responsibility
to report any discriminatory
practices they encounter dur
ing rush.

provisions of the document —
calls on Panhellenic to se-
cure promises from sorority
alumni that recommendations
be wrilten without regard to
race or religion.

The Senate has also passed
a resolytion calling for open
occupancy legislation in Ev-
anston, a suburb north of Chi-

Panhellenic Council presi-
dent Natalie Krewitsky said
the resolution is ‘virtually
unenforceable.” One of the
