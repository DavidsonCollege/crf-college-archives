Traffic
Discussed
By IFC

A discussion of one-way traf-
fic around the fraternity court
during Spring Frolics highlight-
ed the Interfraternity Council
meeting Monday night.

According to Tom Brown, IFC
secretary, the consensus of the
meeting was that the one-way
traffic aided ‘‘in preventing traf-
fic jams, particularly on the
far side of the court.”

Also discussed at the meeting
were the possibility of the IFC
assuming full responsibility in
dealing with hazing offenses and
an IFC retreat on October 1 to
discuss the fraternity system,

Ben Cannon was elected to
represent the IFC on the Social
Council, while David Jennings,
Bobby Vagt. Hal Young, West-
ray Battle and Julian Fite were
chosen to represent the frater-
nity system.

Next week fraternity presi-
dents and rush chairmen will
meet with the IFC to discuss
next year’s rush regulations.

Father Conroy Speaks
On Changes In Church

By JOE SAUNDERS
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Today's college student finds

himself in a new relation to the
church on campus, a Catholic
priest told the student body
Tuesday in chapel.

Father Donald Conroy, assist-
ant director of the Newman As-
sociation at the University of
Minnesota, speaking in the
broader context of the role of
the layman in today’s church,
feels there has been a great
change in the role of the lay-
man of the Catholic Church in

the past five years. In the past,
the hierarchy of the Church
minimized the priestly role of
the laity.

But the new constitution of
the Church, drawn up by the
Second Vatican Council, gives
its highest consideration, not to
the hierarchy, but to the “people
of God."* In the constitution, the
Council stated that the lay
apostulate was a part of the
church in its mission of salva-
tion.

Nothing was said about the
laity being directed by the heir-

“TY am a poet—a poet whose

involvement comes from inner
need, whose language is film.
Beware of poets. Shoot the po-
ets. And perish. The poets are
the Jews of America.”

An antimated cartoon by a
10-year-old, a six-hour film of a
naked man sleeping, an cight-
hour epic of the Empire State
Building standing and a movie
entitled ‘‘The Queen of Sheba
Meets the Atom Man” are all
part of the underground cinema
which Jonas Mekas discussed in
the College Union Wednesday
afternoon.

Mekas, who appeared on cam-
pus for the showing of his film,
The Brig, is the acknowledged
leader of the underground cin-
ema in the United States.

The GSrig was an extremely
emotions! film about the cruel-

archy of the Church. Although
commissioned into the service
of the Church by the act of
baptism, a decree known as the
“lay apostulate’’ states that a
member of the laity has his own
mission apart from the _hier-
archy of the Church.

Father Conroy also spoke of
the role of the Catholic Church
in secular universities, which is
known as the Newman Apostul-
ate. He said the only way a
church can be active in a large
secular university, such as Min-
nesota, is through the actions
of the students.

Both the church and the state
have restricted students from
forming true religious commit-
ments. If a student is to be a
part of the church on campus
he must be free from compul-
sion. Conroy further stated, ‘‘Un-
less a man is free, he is not in
the church. (He must be) not
driven by coercion, but by a
sense of duty."

During the following coffee
hour, Father Conroy answered

questions on a wide variety of «
subjects. A strong supporter of -
nonviolent resistance and civil -
rights, he stated that demon- -

Strations have a proper place
on campus, and in some cases
may be the students only way.
of making themselves heard. But
too often, demonstrators are
only expressing ‘‘an adolescent
urge’ to be seen.

Conroy also gave his opinion
of the Vatican Council, the hier-
archy of the Catholic Church,
and the possibility of the event-
ual re-unison of the Christian
Church. In the future, he said,
such a union could be possible,
with mutual acceptance of the
Bible as a bisis for accord.

ties to prisoners in a Marine
brig. and actually was a film of
a play performed in New York
two years ago.

Mekas went to the play on its
closing night and, five minutes
after it started, he said to him-
self, “I have to film it.”

Mekas thought, ‘What if this
were a real brig and I were
making a real film of it?’ Thus
Mekas sees The 8rlg as the Jast
step in the cinema verlte,’ a
technique which involves shoot-
ing actual events at the whim
of the cameraman producing a
‘gush of light-motion.”

REALITY

To Mekas, treating the play as
if it were reality is the ultimate
in this technique.

Because it was the play's last
tun, Mekas had to persuade all
the actors to perform one more
time especially for his camera.

The entire cast, plus Mekas,

who made the film single-hand-
edly, entered the locked theater
through a coal chute late that
night and were finished by 4
a.m.

The movie's effect is nerve-
wracking. The camera changes
angles suddenly and seemingly
at random, and the screams of
the prisoners are magnified and
distorted by the crude sound sys-
tem Mekas used.

SEIZE THE AUDIENCE

Time says, “The movie does
exactly what it sets out to do—
sizes the audience by the shirt
front and slams it around from
wall to wall for one grueling day
in a Marine Corps lock-up.”
Mekas himself says that during
the filming, ‘All my senses
were stretched to the point of
breaking.”

Mekas feels that the impor-
tant thing about the film is the
impression one gets from it. He

ts Will Consider
‘Regulations Changes

Court May Improve
Honor System Concept

The Student Council made plans for Monday’s re-
ferendum at its meeting this week. The referendum will
include voting’ on the proposed Student Body Regula-
tions Court and on the gambling and hazing regulations.

Paul Marion, who will chair
the Student Body Regulations
Court, said, ‘This’ change will
improve the enforcement of
Student Body .Regulations as
well as the Honor System.”

Marion added. “I would urge
the Student Body to repeal both
the gambling and hazing re-
gulations. Neither rule has stu-
dent support and therefore hurts
the whole idea of Student Body
Regulations. The gambling re-
gulation was originated when
gambling was considered im-
moral and to protect students
from misusing their money.

“The hazing regulation was to
protect freshmen against hazing
by upperclassmen. Since it is
now solely a fraternity issue,
the IFC is the proper enforce-
ment agency.”

The council elected Steve
Humphrey student. representa-
tive to the Committee on Fra-
ternities, Clubs and Social Life:

‘Arch McCallum and Tom Cook ‘
to the Athletic Committee; Tom
Edrnhardt as Chairman of the
Referendum and Potis Commit: .
tee; and Fletcher Hartsell as
Davidson's delegate to the State
Student Legislature.

A committee to study a Course
Evaluation Program was set up
with Ken Autrey as chairman.
and Ben Cannon and John
Gresham as members.

A proposal that the Council
support Ken Childs in his in-
vestigation into the possibility of
turning the Carolina Hotel into
a coffee house for students and
professors was accepted.

In other business, the Council
approved a suggestion by Tom
Rhodes that articles stolen from
the gym be reported to the
Athletic Department and Tom

Chapel and Vesper cuts if they
are not recorded within a week.

MEKAS DISCUSSES FILMS
Moderator Gordon Ball Is At Left

blem, though it was in some re-
spects rather vague.

Mike Booe, president of the
IFC, was “impressed with it as
a whole. T thought it was fair
and well thought out,” he said.

Penn Spell, president of KA,
called the report ‘‘optimistic’
and added that it “came close
to defining the problem,” while
Andy Little, an independent, con-
sidered it ‘misleading to call
these groups fraternities after
redefining their expectations and
their very nature.”

Dr. J. D. Kelton, associate
professor of psychology, stated,
“I have a great deal of general
agreement with the report. The
plea here,” he continued, ‘‘is
one for everybody on the cam-
pus to take an honest look and
not just to defend positions.”

THOROUGH AND UNBIASED

“Honest, thorough, and = un-
biased’’ was the manner in
which Professor W. G. McGa-
vock described the committee's
report. John Todd, an independ-
ent and former editor of The
Davidsonian, saw it-as ‘‘a formal
report of what fraternities can
do, not what they must do.” He
added that it was ‘‘unfortunate’’
that the report had not circulat-
ed among the fraternities and
the independents.

In examing the first problem
presented by the report — that
of “rejection” — eating clubs
were generally considered a de-
sirable corrective measure. Both

‘Booe and Tom Brown, presi-
dent of PKA, looked at eating

clubs as competiton which the
fraternities needed in order to
improve themselves.
FRAGMENTATION
Little felt that such clubs
could bring together the ‘‘frag-
mentation of student life — so-
cial, intellectual, athletic.’’ Dr.
McGavock saw a distinct place
for the eating club on campus

—Tand thought that some students

would welcome a choice instead

of being ‘‘forced into the fra-

ternity mold.”

Booe believed that the pre-
sence of active clubs of this
type on campus would cause
the fraternities to first sell the
Greek system and then the in-
dividual houses, instead of re-
lying on the fact that no other
type of social affliation was
available.

Todd agreed that the core of
the problem is providing social
life for all who want it. “I-have
no argureent against the groups
themselves, but against the sys-
tem with its rejection."

A second problem cited by
the committee was termed
*‘anti-intellectualism.” Both Booe
and Todd felt that the fraterni-
ties were taking steps to rid
themselves of that stigma. ‘The
fraternities must broaden their
‘scope — not just have parties
and eat together,"’ Booe said.

Dr. Kelton expressed the be-
lief that fraternities have simply
evolved to serve social rather
than intellectual needs. Little
continued with the ‘same idea.
“Anti-intellectualism," he said,,
“‘comes partially from the fact
that the fraternity is organized
on an entirely social basis.”

Dr. Max Polley, associate pro-
fessor of Bible and_ religion,
didn't believe the fraternity
should be another classroom,
but they ‘‘shouldn't be in opposi-
tion to the academic life.”

Dr. McGavock saw the pro-
blem as an attitude within the
fraternity, not as an external
program on its part.

He expressed the idea that it
was difficult to show an “out-
ward manifestation of intellect-
ualism" and that the fraternities
were creating an atmosphere
withing themselves which inhib-
ited the expression of academic
interests.

ISSUE IS SELECTIVITY

Dr. Kelton submitted that the
issue lay not with these two pro-
blems but instead with the de-
sire on the part of the frater- .
nities to select some students
and to reject others.

He contended that the advan-
tages of ‘‘close association with
others,"’ of a “congenial and re-
laxed atmosphere,’ and of an
“organized social life’’ — the
advantages of fraternity life
listed in the report — could be
provided in ways other than fra-
ternities.

The basic problem was the de-
sire to be a part of a selective
system. He added that this pro-
blem was compounded by the
organization of the fraternities
on a national level.

In summarizing the report,
Bob King, a senior member of
ATO, stated, ‘The committee re-
port has given the fraternities
the benefit of the doubt in not
judging our responsibility to the
college community. I believe
the report shows that fraterni-
ties are not filling their role and
that the time has come for us
to justify our existence.”

Booe concluded that “if we
don’t show some positive re-
sponse, then the fraternity sys-
tem is on the way out at this
college.”
