Where The Girls Aren't

College basketball recruiting seems to occupy
more than its share of space in the newspapers lately.
Almost every day I read about some high school player
who is all-everything being signed by some institution.
The announcement of the signing usually appears on
the second or third page of the sports news. With some
players the comic pages would be more appropriate.

Besides the name, height, and weight of the in-
dividual, the newspaper article includes all the impres-
sive statistics the recruit has totaled in his three years
of high school. Following this, a quote about the boy
by the head coach is thrown in to make the whole af-
fair appear like a serious business transaction which
maybe it is. More often the signing “ceremony” is an
excuse for the coach to release some off-season pub-
licitv. South Carolina’s Frank McGuire declared USC
the basketball capital of the world after he signed a
certain 6'10’. wonder boy. I'm sure this statement
shouldn’t really be taken seriously.

it goes without saying, that recruiting is a large
part of the “big time” college basketball coach’s job
today. With yery few: exceptions the nationally ranked
teams of next year will be.the results of good recruiting
two or three years ago. It seems as though teams are
made and lost in the spring time after the season is
over when the “critical time” of recruiting descends.

Being on both sides of this “rat race.” I see college
basketball recruiting as both a bad and’ good practice.
Needless to sav, like my skin team (substitutes) com-
rades. I wasn't the most sought after piece of basket-
ball material during mv senior year in high school.
Still. séveral coaches from various schools. both big
and small. did see.me once in a while/‘so I feel 1 can
speak from limited experience.

Although the pressure. wasn't very bad on me. |
think. recruiting hurts a high schoo! athlete who is
sort of bewildered with the whole question of schools
and. basketball teams. and is not really sure of what
he wants. Then-again, basketball recruiting provides
a way he can see different campuses and. student
bodies at no cost. to himself. Also the recruit doesn’t
lose anv weight eating those big steaks the recruiting
coaches buy him.

From my bad and good experiences, | divide bas-
ketball recruiting into two classes: the big university
“glance at it’ system and the small college “‘live in if”
level. Naturally both levels show the best they have to
offer while hiding the worst. The big university tends
to show only the spacious athletic dornt which will be
the player's home for four years. Having no athletic
dorm, the small-college lets the recruit stay with the
rest of the students.

Likewise the big university exhibits the large beau-
tiful field house where the team practices and plav.
The small. college reveals .its small. student body by
taking the recruit to certain classes with the most in-
teresting professors. The big university keeps the
recruit away from the masses while the small college
strives to show that they don’t have any. Both “selling”
systems work differently, depending upon the individ-
ual. .
Certainly Davidson fits in the small college re-
cruiting level. although it usually does a better job
than. most of the big universities. Davidson can offer
most of what the big universities have except.one im-
portant thing and in the two or three days the recruit
is here, he doesn’t really notice what’s missing. It
usually takes the first week of his freshman year be-
fore the Davidson basketball signee starts wondering
where all the girls are. Then it’s too late.

Well, girls or not, basketball recruiting does give
the player one good thing: a free education. All he has
to do is live with the school and ine coach for four

years. fl

Sophomore Star Slade:
Bright Light In ’Cat Fog

By DON SEWELL
Associate Editor

Davidson's Wildcat base-
ball. team has been unable
to find the winning secret
this season, but it has found
quite a hitter in Gordon
Slade.

The sophomore fright field
er. converted from third
base, is hitting an even .500
clip after 22 games.

Sla@e’s average is good
enough to make him the
leading hitter in the South.
ern Conference. In 78 trips
to the plate this year, he has
hit safely 39 times.

Slade: does not attribute
his success against pitchers
to any tricks or gimmicks.
He does not use a split grip
or go through any batter's
box ritual.

“T have always tried to bat
the correct. way. I listen to
the things people say and 1
have tried to do what pro
duces the best results,” he
said.

“When you're hitting ihe
ball. sooner oy later you ‘are
going to stop getting good

particularly impressive to
Slade. ‘‘Almost all the pitch-
ers we have played against
have been right handers with
average speed, control and
junk. They have been sort
of stereotyped."

Last year on the freshman
team, Slade hit right around
450 for the season. In addi-

‘tion’ to playing third base, he

pitched some last year. His
mound efforts were not sat-
isfyving to him, so this sea-
son he has not pitched at all.

Slade has ‘heen actively
scouted by professional
teams. After his graduation
from high school in Evans-
ville. Indiana, scouts from
Cincinnati and Baltimore
tried to get him under con-
tract. But his college plans
kept him from accepting
any offers.

Fielding presented Slade
with some problems while he,
was’ playing the infield this
year. About halfway through
the season Coach‘ Tom Ste:
vens moved him to right
field. Since the shift, Slade
has not committed an error.

Slade said that he has been
able to keep his average high
because of some good breaks
in the middle of the season.

He added that the play of
the team late in the season
has made the year more sat-
isfying to him than the earl.
er part of the schedule. “Now
we're not beating ourselves
so much,” he said.

The ‘Cats have four more
games to play, all conference
games. Slade is a_ strong
contender for both the All.
Conference team and the hat.
ting crown.
