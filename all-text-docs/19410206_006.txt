Dring what part of the 24-hour |
day are most persons being killed |
oe, our highways?

Stetisties show that although
most of the automobile traffic is in
the <izytime, most of the fatalities
occur at night, Six out of every
ten deaths occur while three out
of every four cars are safely ga-
raged for the night. These highly
pertinent facts are revealed in
“Lest We Regret,” the ninth in an
annual series of booklets pub-

lished by The Travelers Insurance
Company in the interests of high-
, way ‘safety.
' During the period from 1930.
| through 1937, deaths due to auto-
{mobile accidents during the hours
of darkness increased 54.5%; while
| fatalities during daylight actually
decreased 5.4%.

These facts, the booklet points
out, are a challenge to traffic ex-
perts to devise physical safeguards
which will eliminate some of this
night-time slaughter. They are a
challenge to public officials to put
into force whatever legal restric-
tions may be necessary to curb
these crastts. Mpst of all, they
are a challenge/to drivers and
pedestrians to double their cau-
tion in driving and walking at
night.

Highway safety, in a last anal-
ysis, will never be achieved
through the efforts of a few engi-
neers, publie officials and law-
makers, Only the combined ef-
forts of 40,000,000 drivers and 100,-
000,000 ° pedestrians will accom-
plish it.
