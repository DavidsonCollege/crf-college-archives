Union room gets more than a new name

It reminds me of “the artist formerly known as Prince,” is how
the Union’s Big Screen Room’s name change strikes sophomore
Jonathan Sipling. Actually, Home Room, formerly knownas the Big
Screen Room, has more than just a new name. “‘All of the flags of all
of the different countries from which current International Students
come now hang in that room,” explains Assistant Professor if English
Annie Ingram. The name was selected to reflect the display’s
“celebration and tribute to the wonderful diversity which Interna-
tional Students bring to us ... For me, Home Room is wonderfully
evocative,” she says. Rather than simply a strange, unfamiliar
country, “‘all of those flags represent somebody’s home.”

Davidson students have a voice

Davidson students finally have a unified voice. Today a 13 page
compilation of student concerns and complaints was delivered
directly to major campus organizations, including Residence Life,
the Athletic Office, the Computer Center, and Patterson Court. The
report is the result of Dorm Storm, the Student Government
Association’s (SGA) most recent effort to communicate directly
with all members of the student body. SGA senators visited each on-
campus dorm and apartment last spring, recording students’ con-
cerns and suggestions about all aspects of Davidson life.

Sophomore Senator Jonathan Sipling, who led the Dorm Storm
effort, says the report “starts out with concerns mentioned most often
and then goes on to include some students’ novel ideas.” Sipling says
he hopes that organizations who receive the report will use it as an aid
in addressing student concerns. .

In focus ... NEW PROFESSORS

Debra Fisher: “I come from an artistic background”

By DANIELLE MILES
Staff Writer

‘I come from a pretty artistic
background .... [had an uncle who
taught at a university.... He was a
ceramist ....
My sister was
alsoa major in-
fluence ...”

So be-
gins the expla-
nation pro-
vided by Visit-
ing Assistant
Professor of Art Debra Fisher, of
the factors that influenced her de-
cision to become a professor of art.

Fisher continues, describing
a childhood during which she was

constantly exposed to crafts, gal-
leries, and her father’s own work
as a draftsman, all of which famil-
iarized her to the tools of art.
Inher first print-making class,
Fisher says, a professors “chal-
lenged me on what I was drawing
... what does art mean to me... how
to make it speak on many levels
that are personal to myself.”
After graduating from the
University of Delaware, Fisher
worked in arestaurant for ten years,
while she continued to have access
to art facilities at the University.
In exchange for maintaining
the shop, she was givena key to the
facilities, allowing her to go in
after work and “work ’til dawn.”
Fisher has received grants al-

lowing her to travel to Dresden,
Germany and work in a govern-
ment print shop.

Through other grants she trav-
elled to Mexico City and across the
Southwest.

Her research there, especially
in Tucson, Arizona, included stud-
ies of Retablo and Ex-vodo, reli-
gious painting that strongly influ-
enced a piece of her own — cur-
rently on display at the faculty
show.

Scheduled to remain at
Davidson for one year, this is only
Fishers’ second official teaching
position.

She comes to Davidson from
Denison University, where she
taught for eight years.

Durwin Striplin: Science is full of puzzles

By Ann Cup
Staff Writer

Arecent addition to the Chem-
‘istry Department, Dr. Durwin
Striplin is not who one thinks of as
a typical professor.

He first attended New Mexico
State University in his hometown
of Las Cruces,
New Mexico.
After four
years of
|| school, twelve

credits short of
an engineering
major, Striplin
dropped out to
“find himself’ by playing in rock
bands and working.

“T played in bands so much
that it took ‘a long time to finish
school,” says Striplin. “I was a
professional musician with student

on the side. I also got more dates
that way.”

Two years later, Striplin went
back to school at Eastern New
Mexico University.

Graduating from college nine
years after he graduated from high
school, Striplin pursued science,
obtaining degrees in chemistry and
mathematics.

“T love waking up in a new
world everyday. Science has so
many puzzles that you just can’t
know it all,” he says. “You have
something to look forward to ev-
ery day, it is always surprising.”

In 1989, Striplin went to
Washington State University to
work with Dr. Glen Crosby.

Although Striplin describes
Crosby as an “old cranky son of a
bug,” Crosby was also one of
Striplin’s greatest mentors. “I
could have gone anywhere,” says

Davidson’s newest chemistry pro-
fessor. “But there was a reason
why I wanted to work for Dr.
Crosby. He trained scientists and
left a legacy of people who love
science.”

In 1994, Striplinearneda Ph.D
inchemical physics and left Wash-
ington for the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill to be a re-
search scientist.

He says he has enjoyed his
experience at Davidson, so far.
“I’m shocked and amazed and
pleasantly surprised with the stu-
dents here. It is more than a job,
it’s areal joy. It’s been a wonderful
change between teacher and re-
search scientist. Number one,
you’ re a lot lonelier when you’re a
research scientist,” says Striplin.

_  Striplin has two children;
Mariah is three and Melissa is one.
His wife Caryn is a neurochemist.

Tim Waples: Happy to be a Wildcat again |

By DouG PENHALLEGON
Staff Writer

A Charlotte native and mem-
ber of Davidson’s class of ‘85, Dr.
Tim Waples is thrilled to be teach-
ing English at
his alma mater.
Waples asks
od his English 101

, and 201 stu-

'
Pty * \dents to call
him Tim.
a Pe. Char-

high school as “bureaucratic and
stupid”, Waples chose Davidson
for its small size and nurturing
environment. As a student here
Waples served as Defense Advisor
to the Honor Council, Hall Coun-
selor, Union Board Member, and
belonged to a now defunct coed
eating house. Although he started
out as a political science major,

acterizing his .

Waples’ interest in political litera-
ture led him to be acenter major in
American studies.

After graduating from
Davidson, Waples pursued a
master’s degree in American Stud-
ies from the University of Iowa.
His experience there was ambiva-
lent; although he liked the inde-
pendence, he missed Davidson’s
faculty/student interaction and
emphasis on teaching. Uncertain
as to his next step after Iowa,
Waples took a friend’s advice and
began teaching high school in Jack-
son, Mississippi.

Quickly developing a passion
for his job, Waples decided that
teaching was what he truly wanted
todo, although ona more advanced
level. He enrolled in a Ph.D. pro-
gram in English at the University
of Pennsylvania, and six years later
finds himself back at Davidson,
only this time with his back to the

chalkboard.

Waples says, “I’m impressed
by the changes that have occurred
since I left, but even more im-
pressed by the things that have
stayed the same.”

Among his favorite aspects of
Davidson are the Honor Code, an
enthusiastic faculty, and Union
Board. Although worried about the
power of conformity here, Waples
says he is looking forward to mak-
ing fresh judgments about
Davidson students.

Currently Waples is research-
ing 1950s American Literature and
Culture in regard to the influence
of the Cold War. He is married to
Anne Lambert, class of ‘86, and in
his spare time he enjoys playing
sports and listening to jazz and
blues music.

When asked if he planned to
settle in Davidson, Waples says,
“T’d love to.”
