BENNETT SPEAKS
AT Y. M.C. A.

At the regular Y. M. C. A. meeting
last Thursday evening, R. H. Bennett
gave an excellent talk on “The Prob-
lems of South America.” He stated that
due to the oppression by the Roman
Catholics these people had  develoned
such characteristics as suspicion, low
moral standards, common irreverance,
laziness, and its sequence, ignorance,
seventv-one per cent of these people be-
ing illiterate. He pointed out that this
opnression brought about also a crisis in
both educational. commercial and indus-
trial matters. But, he explained, the
peonle are beginning to realize their
conditions and are fast removing this
state of servitude and submission to
Catholicism. Bv the aid of Pan-Amer-
ican influences, and largely by the aid of

Tomorrow.”

During the meeting resolutions were
passed thanking W. G. Somerville for
his work as president and expressing re-
gret at being forced to accept his resig-
nation.
