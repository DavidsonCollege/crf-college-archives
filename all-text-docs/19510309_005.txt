Breaks Two Records
And Swims on Relay
For Scoring Honors

Shattering records in two events
and swimming a leg on his team’s
second place 200-yard relay four-
some, Gray Hampton paced the
Sigma Chi's to the interfraternity
swimming championship Thursday
afternoon, the zecond major inter-
frat title for that frat within a
week's time,

Having just last week finished
the basketball season without de-
feat to claim the cage crown, the
Sigma Chi’s chiefly on the strength
of Hampton’s outstanding perfor-
mance, edged the Kappa Signia‘s
23.21 with three points garnered
in the final event of the day, the
200 relay.

Hampton won the finals of the
individual medley in 51.5, consider-
ably toppling the old mark of 58.2,
set by Charlie Baldwin of SAE in
the first interfrat swim fast year.
The Huntington, W. Va., senior
also won the 75-yard freestyle in
44.2, but had already set a new
mark of 43.8 in time trials on Wed-
nesday. The old record of 44.0 was
set by Francis Pepper of Beta
Theta Pi last year. Hampton was
the meet’s high scorer with 11
points.

Two other marks also fell in the
two days competition. John Stiefel,
SAE from Jacksonville, Fla. cut
KA Gene Regen's 1950 mark of
34.9 on the 50 yard backstroke to

° 34.7 in trials, winning the finals
in 35, George Crone of Kappa Sig-
ma broke Baldwin's 37.3 record on
the 50 yard breaststroke with a
34.7 performance in time trials,
and then came through in the finals
with a slower but still record-break-

ing 36.2.
Bill Pritchett, an outstanding
swimmer for Phi Delta Theta,

missed trying his old mark of 11.2
on the 25 yard dash, winning the
1951 event in the not-too-slow time
of 11.3. The Phi Delts finished
third, closely trailing the two lead-
ers with 19 points.

A Winston Salem trio, Crone,
Fred Spach, and Nab Armfield
paced the Kappa Sigs in their point
collection.

After the Phi Delts, no one was
close to the first three: teams. The
Betas were fourth with nine points,
followed by SAE with seven, KA
with five, and Pika’s with three
and SPE with one. Pi Kappa Phi
and the Campus club did not enter.

The Summaries:

150 yard Medley: 1—Kappa Sig-
ma, 2-—Sigma Chi, 3—Phi Delts,
4—KA. Time 1:45.4.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

With the majority of the spring sports teams kicking off next
week-end. the season of sunshine and flowers, ball games and
showers is here before March 22. The above scene should be re-
peated many times this year on the tennis courts, but the repetitions
will hardly carry the oomph this one did. It is a shot of Bo Roddey
playing Clark Taylor of Carolina two years ago when Davidson

nipped the Tar Heels, 5-4, for the State title. In the upper left

To Bank On Ginger 1 Wake Forest's Deacons, play-

Freshman baseball practice un-
officially opened March 5, with
about 25 boys present. Official
practice sessions begin March 12
with Coach Baird at the helm.
More boys are expected out when
spring football practice ends. The
first week's work is conditioning
workouts, consisting of running,
throwing, and pepper games.

The Freshman squad has a ten.
tative schedule of 12 games at the
present with the possibility of a
few more being added fater. The
first game is scheduled for April
10th. Most of the teams that the
Freshmen will play are the larger
high schools in this section of the
State—Central, Harding, and Tech
of Charlotte, and Gastonia High are
some of the foes.

With a small club to pick from
and not too much depth, the out-
come of the season depends largely
on the teamwork and spirit that
the team can build up in a month's
work. Coach Baird’s outlook is
somewhat dubious now, but with
good weather and a little luck a
good season is anticipated.

‘Nets Hustle To Make Up Lost Time

Before Opener With Springtield

By CHARLIE HASSELL

Coach Derrick Barton is in

a dither. For he has only about

ten days in which to shape up a team to oppose Springfield Col-

lege when they play here on March 20th. |
' Moulding a team means lining up single players, pairing [5

4

off doubles players, and then putting the finishing touches on

the team as a’ whole—quite a job
for only a ten day period. It was
not until last Wednesday that the
tennis aspirants began intra-squad
ladder competition to determine
this year’s team members.

The only two men who are

almost certain starters are
Captain Allen Strand, and
Dewey Keesler, these being

the only returning starters

from last year. Lettermen Bill

Child and Pete Kennedy will

be heavy bidders for the third

and fourth spots.

There are about 16 or 18 men
out. for the tennis team at present,

and these must be whittled down
to squad size. The freshmen have
not yet started, due. to lack of
court space, but will probably be-
gin the latter part of this week or
the first. of next week.

Among those who are out
for the squad at present are
several who were members of
last year's freshman squad——
Joe Dudley, Bill Bivens, Bill
Bledsoe, and Bob Walker.
These men are expected to add
to the team’s depth in an at.
tempt to fill some of the gaps
left by last year’s graduating
net men.

New Head Skipper Frank Packard
Has One More Week To Drill Club

By CHARLIE (AWKINS

Davicson’s baseball team sta
the watchful eves of new Coach
named to the job at the beginning

| With the first game with Spirir
have only a little over.a week in wh

get in shape for the coming season.

Beside this short training period,
the Cats have a. letterman shortage
with only five returnees on hand.
Thus it is mainly up to the trans-
fers and the. sophomores to make
or break this season. On the

‘d practice this week under
nk Packard, who was only

the week.
Id on March 19, the Cats
o ready themselves and

ing. Nev omers Carl Thompson and
Jim McFarland are scrapping it
out at s¢cond, as are Chuck Elliott
and’ Mac Doubles at shortstop.
Third base‘is wide ‘open with T..W.
Aldred and Jimmy Miller fighting

mound, Davidson can boast two] it out for the hot corner position

In the outfield the Cat's strength

jyear’s ace, and Harold Smith, Soph. | ties, with two lettermen back and

omore's Jim Smith and Paul East: | two promising

sophomores. Au.

man are very promising here and! hurcn Lambeth and Jack Branch are

could heeame first rate fingers this
season, Goach Vackard can rely on
Lee Faltbirt and Bert Downs in the
catching department, and both
should become steaily receivers, al-
though they haven’{ had any var-
sity experience, ,

The infield is the sore thumb of
the. teant, with not a returning let:
lerman: yet thore is great promise
here. At first base, Sophoniore Nr
nold. Wirisnant holds out, with Tom
Craven backing him up. Craven is
also a first rate hatdy man, doub-

the returnees, and together with
Rill Rowland and Jerry Morrow,
they could give the outfield the
needed punch. All four are heavy
hitters and good fielders.

Coach Packard faces a rough as-
signument in his first year as the
Cat baseball coach, but it can be-
come a pleasant one if he can rouhd
the players into shape fast enough
and get good play out of the new-
comers. The success of this season
can depend on the ability of the
sophs. and transfers to make the

line in the outfield and also pitch- | grade in varsity competition.
