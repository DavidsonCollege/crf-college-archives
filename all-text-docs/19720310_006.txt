Nader-Inspired Research
Proliferates On Campuses

By BILL GIDUZ

There is presently a move-
ment i2 many universities a

round the nation to form Pub *

(PIRG). Several states already
have functioning groups, and
both North and South Carolina
ure starting to se: up PIRG as
well.

If a student has a complaint
on any matter from pollution of
a local creek to high bookstore
prices, he is encuraged to bring
it up before his campus PIRG
board. After reviewing all com.
plaints, the local board acts on

Guret Teaches, Writes, Raps
As Treatise Slowly Proceeds

By PHIL BISHOP
Staff Writer

His name may be unfamiliar
to upperclassmen, but his face
is certainly familiar to fresh-
men and other patrons of the
Union cafeteria. John Guret can
usually be found there, laughing
and talking with a group of in-
\erested students.

Guret is spending a year at
Davidson while he finishes work
on his book, He said he came
to Davidson “because it’s quiet
and I can work here unmolest-
ed.” Guret holds degrees in li-
terature from Yale and Harvard.
and a theological degree from
Westminster Seminary.

Guret said Davidson's faculty
compared favorably with Yale’s
and Harvard’s, ‘‘partly because
here professors are under less
pressure to publish and can
concentrate more on teaching.”

Guret audited an English
class last term and he is shar-
ing teaching duties in Prof.
Charles Lloyd's Literary Critic
ism class now.

Guret has been developing his
book. “Christianity and the The
ory of Literature.” since 1958
He said it involves ‘‘a fusion of
Augustinian values and literary
expression.’”’ At Yale, Guret was
an editor for Rene Wellek, a
leading literary theorist.

Guret said that his connection
of Christian thought with litera-
ture has raised problems of
language. In any relatively new
interpretation. ‘“‘one must either
give old terms new meanings
and risk misunderstanding, or
create a new vocabulary and
risk obscurity,” he said.

Guret taught for seven years
at Dordt College in Iowa, and
student reactions have helped

ARA Slater Survey Polls
Strong Student Approval

By BRUCE MALOY
Staff Writer

This past November, ARA
Slater unit manager Ron Scott
ran a survey to determine the
students’ feelings about the food
service and their preferences
about particular foods. The re-
sults of this survey now have
been compiled and are being
studied in hopes of improving
the food service.

The survey indicates that the
students approve of the way that
the cafeteria is run on almost
every point. The areas which
received the highest percent-
ages of positive responses were
quality of food served, size of
portions, seconds policy, buffet
style service, courtesy of em-
ployees, appearance of regular
employees, flavor of food served
and standards of cleanliness.

Scott stated that the main pro-
blem with the much criticized
outdoor picnics was: that they
seemed to attract the rain.

The two areas which drew the
largest number of “‘no opinions”
were the manner of acceptance
of suggestions and complaint
handling.

Manager Ron Scott was al a
loss to explain this trend ex-
cept to say that the ARA Slater

staff tries to correct problems
before someone has to com-
plain. It was noted that ninety-
three percent of those answer-
ing the survey approved of the
availability of the management.

Another part of the survey
asked for the students’ favorite
food in several categories.
Among the entrees, roast beef
ranked as the favorite followed
by roast turkey, steak and fried
chicken. Chinese beef and green

peppers came in last in this
category.
Corn, string beans, french

fries and mashed potatoes were
the favorite vegetables. Lettuce
and tomatoes ranked first in
the salad category with carrot
and raisin salad faring poorly.

The great American favorites, .

the hamburger and the. cheese-
burger, were the preferred
sandwiches while the grill
cheese brought up the rear.

Ice cream sundaes won out
as the favorite dessert, leaving
rhubarb and purple plum cob-
bler tied for last place. In the
final category, milk beat coffee
as the favorite beverage.

The results from this part of
the survey will be used to help
plan menus in the future, Scott
said

him to Clarify his theories. “My
students have been a_ blessing
to my book. They show an in-
fallible detection of fraudulence
in thought and obscurity in lan-
guage.” he remarked.

Rene Wellek and Charles
Llovd have also helped Guret
discipline his approach. ‘‘At
first, I tended to be dogmatic
because of my insecurity. Now
I’m certain my approach is a
legitimate one, though not the
only legitimate cne.”

Guret said he is convinced
Christianity “is relevant both to
d-sciplines of thought and to in-
dividuals, and thus  intellectu-
ally defensible.”

ones it feels valid on a state-
wide level to the state board
of PIRG directors. Action is
conducted through a full time
staff, hired lawyers, investiga
tors and specialists.

Great controversy has arisen
on several campuses, notably
the Univers:ty of South Carolina,
over the method of collection of
funds to finance PIRG. Each
student is taxed $3 per year by
the school, that amount just
being added on‘o his school bill.

The collected money then is
ziven to the campus PIRG who
keeps some for local activities
and gives the rest to the state
board.

At USC, the YAF (Young
Americans for Freedom) bitter-
ly resented this at first, but
then it’ was revealed that any
student who wants to can have
his money refunded. Requests
for refunds have not been over-
whelming, however. Only 24 out
of 20,000 students at the Univer-
sity of Minneso-a wanted their
money back.

Students elect the members
of the campus board, and each
campus board in turn elects
the State board.

Although no attempt has been
made to begin such an organi-
zation at Davidson, at least eight
colleges and universities in
North and South Carolina are
working on PIRG_ chapters.
They include Duke, UNC, NC
State, UNC-G, Clemson, USC
and Winthrop. Apparently, no
statewide board will be elected
until local units are more or-
ganized.

Ralph Nader originated the

concept of PIRG, but no funds
for local or state units come
from his national consumer pro-
tection. organization.

Nader fee's, ‘‘Citizenship ex-
perience should be an integral
part of educational attain
ments."" and he thinks PIRG
can be part of this citizenship
experience.
