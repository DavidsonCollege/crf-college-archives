THE DAVIDSONIAN

JV adds to soccer program

By M.C. Spear

Four years ago Charlie Slagle
encountered an unfamiliar, yet
positive issue. There was a grow-
ing surplus of men’s soccer talent
and interest on our campus. Hence
the formation of the JV program.

The purpose of the team is to
provide a competitive arena for
incoming freshmen and rising
sophomores to sharpen their skills
and raise the level of their owh
game to that of NCAA Division I
status.

Providing actual game play-
ing experience is the foremost com-
ponent of any athlete’s develop-
ment. Davidson is unique in that
most big-time soccer programs
carry large thirty men rosters where
many highly talented players “ride

the pine” for a better part of their
college careers.

Slagle’s varsity program has
benefited greatly. Over one third
of his players are former JV play-
ers who have earned varsity status.

The 1993 JV squad is clearly
the most talented ever, thus prov-
ing that the level of soccer talent
and interest is only growing at
Davidson. -

The team has opened with
three impressive wins. Crushing
victories include 6-2 over Brevard,
4-1 over Andrew, and 4-0 over
Anderson. All of these schools are
powerful Junior College programs.

Come out and watch this ex-
citing team perform and learn how
Davidson College is becoming the
soccer capitol of the country.

Bartholomew made a spectacular
hit when he broke through Rhode’s
offensive line and sacked Welborn.
Senior John Dalton’s presence was
felt all over the field. He led the
Wildcats with nine tackles.
Davidson had only one major mis-
take on defense.

Rhodes wide receiver Justin
Ross was able to slip through the
Cats secondary and catch a37 yard
touchdown pass.

Davidson was extremely
pleased with their performance on
Saturday. They proved tobe effec-

tive on offense and defense.
Davidson scored on six of their
seven times inside the Rhodes 20
yard-line. Last week, the Wildcats
had trouble when close to the end
zone and only produced three

. points in a 7-3 loss to Sewanee.

They solved this problem, how-
ever, and tallied six touchdowns
against Rhodes,

Davidson’s schedule will be

fairly hard for the next couple
weeks.

' They play three successive
road games against Emory and
Henry, Guilford, and Washington
& Lee. They return home for games
onthe last three weekends of Octo-
ber.

play tough tournaments at Wash-

There isn’t as much pressure in

Tennessee State as the major ob-
stacles to overcome. “We should
be competitive. We lost three of
the top six, but we have eight se-

New coaches
to lead
SWIMMING
and diving

By Will Cobb

The 1993 Davidson swim-
ming and diving program brings
many new faces, both in coaching
and players.

. The new head coach is Rich-
ard DeSelm, the former head coach
at UNC-Chapel Hill from 1984-
92. DeSelm brings a great deal to
the program. Originally from
Knoxville, TN, he graduated from
UNC in 1978 and became a coach
immediately followinghis gradua-
tion.

He comes here to accept the
challenge of building a program at
‘an institution committed to aca-
demics. His main objective is to
send competitors to the NCAA
championships.

Though this will take time, he
is committed to stay here until this
goalisachieved.Thisyearhewould _
like to build a foundation by estab-
lishing a strong recruiting base and
work with those swimmers and
divers presently at Davidson.

Now in the fourth year of the
rejuvenated program, Davidson
appears to be in the right direction.
DeSelm brings with him a new
crew of assistants.

They are Chip Lavender, a

‘91 graduate of UNC, and Marcia
Waymouth, a ‘77 graduate of Indi-
ana University, who will coach
divers. Ron Morrow, now the Di-
rector of Physical Education, will
remain involved in the transition,
spending time with the team at
home and on the road.
More than half of this year's team
are freshmen and sophomores.
With Davidson’s small size, it is
difficult to compete with other
Division I schools.

DeSelm hopes to “try to
present Davidson as aunique niche
for students who want a great edu-
cation at a small school which has
made a commitment to swimming
and diving.”

Hopefully, the location will
help present this idea.

This year’s captains: will be
Dan Bahmiller, Morgan Ferrell,
and Jenny Garciga. The first home

meet will be against Florida A&M
on October 23rd.
