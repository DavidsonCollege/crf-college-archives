Dr. Price’

s Speech

Launches ‘Y’ Drive

Christmas Gift To Go To
Hangchow College

To launch the 1946 Christmas
Gift Fund drive, the Y. M. C. A.
was fortunate in being able to pro-
cure one of the church’s foremost
foreign missionaries and one ap-
propriately familiar with this year’s
recipient, Hangchow Christian Col-
lege. At the regular chapel service
on Friday, December 6, “Y” See-
retary Murphy Williams introduced
to the student body Dr. Frank W.
Price, native of Richmond, Vir
ginia; graduate of Davidson (1915);
for 24 years a missionary to China;
and more recently personal adviser
to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek.

Dr. Price

Dr. Price’s”"accomplishments and
honors in both missionary work and
in the Chinese “advisory govern-
ment” are too numerous to detail,
but a brief resume of his work thus
far will suffice to show, his immi-
nent qualifications for presenting
to the donors of the Gift Fund a
realistic picture of Hangchow Col-
lege and of their great needs. After
graduating from Davidson, Dr.
Price taught for several years in
China, then returned to this coun-
try and took his D. D. degree at
Yale Divinity School. When he
went back to China it was as a
missionary of the Presbyterian
Church. He served in various fields,
taught for three years in this same
Hangchow College, and during the

* first part of the war, he headed the
Nanking Theological Seminary of
Free China. Chiang Kai-Shek and
Dr. Price were close friends be-
fore the war years and after
the Sino-American tie-up, the gen-
eralissimo selected Dr. Price as
his personal advisor and liason
officer between the Chinese and
American governments. When
peace came, it was again Dr. Price
who went as Chiang’s personal rep-
resentative to the San Francisco
Conference. However, even with
such weighty diplomatic duties, the
doctor found time.to begin the re-
juvenation of the war-racked mis-
sion field. He and his wife, al-
most by themselves, handled the
Central Mission Office in Shanghai
when the direction for the re-estab-
lishment of mission work came
from the States.

Hangchow Christian College

With this background, Dr. Price
came to Davidson last week to let
the Davidson student body know
for what a great cause his gift
was going. He described the sham-
bles that Hangchow Christian Col-
lege was found in after the depar-
ture of the Japanese; no books, no
lab equipment, and none of the fa-
cilities that “American colleges call
indispensable. Yet in the face of
ruin, Dr. Price proudly related, the
college reopened with a handful of
teachers and a few hundred stu-
dents, a token supply of books, and
no beds. Dr. Price outlined gen-
erally what the fund’s $4,500 would

Queens Girls
Give Dance

Saturday night, December 17,
. Queens College added another link
in the chain of social events which

Seasons in the college history, en-

Music for the affair was furish-
ed by recordings and the dance was
given in honor of the newly formed

Students Told
Of Road Peril

Col. Hatcher Gives Excellent
Talk In Chapel

Due to the tremendous increase
in traffic accidents the heads of
three of the most important law
enforcement organizations in the
State North Carolina came to
Davidson College last Wednesday,
December 4. It was stated that the
number of accidents owing to auto
traffic during the first six months
of this year shows an increase of
171.6 per cent over last year.

of

In light of this, it was highly
appropriate that Col, H. J. Hatcher,
commander of the North Carolina
State Highway Patrol, accompanied
by Chief Stanhope Lineberry of
the Mecklenburg County Police and
Chief Frank N. Littlejohn, of th
Charlotte Police department, should
come to speak to the Davidson stu-
dent body. Colonel Hatcher, in-
troduced by Chief Lineberry, served
in both World Wars, recently a
provost marshal in World War II.

His talk emphasized two main
points, one, that we should each
take much greater care in our own
personal driving, and two, that the
people of the United States should
assist the law enforcement. officers
more readily in the prevention and
prosecution of violations of the
traffic code. In view of the first
point, he mentioned the amazing
change that overcomes the average
American when he gets behind the
wheel of an automobile. Elsewhere
he may be a courteous gentleman,
respecting the rights of others; but
when he gets on the highway, he is
unrecognizable as such. He is self-
ish and extremely discourteous,
thus causing not only unhappy, but
also dangerous driving.

Colonel Hatcher then went on
to describe the inadequacy of the
punishment afforded violators of
traffic regulations in North Caro-
lina. He gave two specific instances
in which flagrant infractions of the
rules were incurred, and which were
judged unworthy of punishment of
any kind by juries. He asked us
to consider how law enforcement
can be carried out when the people
take such an attitude.

His talk gave a vivid picture of
the situation in this state, and in
the nation as a whole. The in-
stances he gave were graphic, in
that they illustrated the attitude
that so many of us have, and he
urged us to be aware of this, try-
ing to correct it. Because, as he
said in effect, “Next year, at this
time, some us in ‘this very com-
munity will be either. direetly or

Jews and analyzed the true nature
of the National Socialist party.
Organizer and leader of anti-Nazi
opposition which grew to national

proportions, he was arrested by
the gestapo on July 1, 1937, on
orders from Hitler. His — trial

which followed in February of 1938
