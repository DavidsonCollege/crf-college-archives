Blue Pencil Poets Sing |

The local chapter of Sigma Upsilon in
keeping with the spirit of approaching!
spring has entered the poetry arena with
a zest that bids fair to flood the local
market. It was agreed at the last meet-
ing of the chapter that each wearer of
the Blue Pencil should submit
at the next meeting a poem of not more

than 48 lines written on the general
theme of childhood reminiscences and

The feature of the meeting held March
3ist, in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Hall,
was the reading of a one-act play writ-
ien by Prof. E. J. Erwin, national pres-
ident of Sigma Upsilon. The play is a
highly humorous and interesting comedy
entitled Ice Cream Soda or The Con-
verted Missionary. A sketch of the life
and works of Sherwood Anderson was
read by W. F.
Blue Pencil.

the credit that is due ‘her.

' In speaking more in regard to the Hang-
chow Christian College, the speaker brought
out the fact that 255 boys are now in the
college, and that large numbers are turned
away every year. He showed views of the
Administration Building, and two of their
large dormitories, which resembled the new
dormitories on the Davidson campus.

In closing, the speaker used highly com-
plimentary words in regard to the Davidson
mén who are connected with him in his work
at Hangchow. He also stated that it was
his desire to enlist a man who is to receive
a degree from Davidson this year, to teach

Doctor Fitch concluded his series of ad-
dresses Monday night when he lectured on
the little known province of Tibet. The
speaker carried his listeners to the strange,

barred to human eyes. Doctor Fitch is one
of the very few authorities on “the people
and customs of ‘Tibet whose
stories have been broadeasted

His lecture was illustrated with stereopti-
can slides. The pictures were taken by the
speaker himself, and tinted and finished by
Chinese artists.

poetry is useful practically. Take for in- |
| stance you are a lover: the adored one will |
swallow all the deep soulful stuff you can |
shove at her. Maybe you have read those |
‘immortal lines beginning,
“If you love me like I love you,
Roses are red and violets are blue . .”
These lines have conquered many a “fire.”
An even more practical use is this. When
you have been “out” the preceding night,
just approach your English prof. and say,
“Oh, noble sir, please don’t rave,
I tell you now I’m not a knave.
| Forgiveness, sir, is what I crave,
Beginning now I'll be your slave
If that zero you will save!”
