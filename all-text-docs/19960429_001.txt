NUMBER 25

SGA votes 16—

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL
Assistant News Editor

After seven days of legal re-
search and soul-searching, the
SGA’s 32 voting members ren-

’ dered ahighly anticipated and con-
troversial decision last Tuesday
evening: by a vote of 15 for, 16
against, and one abstention,
InterVarsity Christian Fellowship

will not be rechartered this year.

IVCF President Macon
Stokes, ajunior, was “disappointed
with the results [of the vote]. I still
think it’s an issue of religious dis-
crimination,” he says.

Spectators spilled out of the
twoand ahalfhour, standing-room-
only SGA meeting last week, some
clearly relieved, others visibly dis-
appointed. IVCF’s request that the

SGA renew itscharterhas sparked
campus wide interest and debate
like few other events in
Davidson’s recent history.
Serious discussion began
two weeks ago when the SGA’s
Charters and By-laws Commit-
tee declined to recommend re-
newal of IVCF’s charter, focus-
ing on a recent amendment to
IVCF’s constitution which states

that IVCF leadership “shouldbe free
of patterns of gossip and slander;
drunkenness; sexual immorality, in-
cluding the practice of homosexual-
ity, or the inappropriate practice of
heterosexual activity outside of the
marriage context; selfish ambition;
hatred; lewdness; and the like,” (Ar-
ticle V, Section 1)

The IVCF has issued a petition
to the SEC, the executive council of

1996-97 school year: After it all,

a year of minor changes and major issues

By ADAM HICKEY
Staff Writer

While we may be tempted by
our papers and exams to recall
only the happenings of the last few
weeks, from the beginning this has
been what President Kuykendall
called, in an off-hand reflection, “a
year of events.”

Shortly into the first semester,
our ego tooka blow when US News
and World Reports dropped our
rank from 8 to 21. By the time fall
convocation rolled around, with
only 32 seniors attending because
it coincided with fall break, aca-
demics had gotten off to a rocky
start.

But students lose interest in

classroom life. We rallied with a
major cry for minors, which we
got. And to sweeten the deal, a
concentration in Southern Studies
was added as well.

You would not know the best
was still to come, though — not
with Letitia Campbell winning the
Rhodes scholarship, Mandy Curtis
and Jennifer Hankins, Watson fel-
lowships.

Some argued that academics
is the focus of Davidson. Others
disagreed, and the annual debate
over religious affiliation erupted
yet again. The SGA said keep the
president Presbyterian, but let the
trustees and religion professors be
non-Christian.

The trustees only half agreed.

In April they reaffirmed our ties
to the Church with a resolution.
In April, they removed the re-
quirement for professors, but the

trustees and the president remain ©

Christian.

For the second year, vocal
Christians erected Easter crosses
as a sign of faith; others saw it as
a sign of aggression and re-
sponded with counter-crosses and
posters, and a crossfire of words
ensued.

IVCF got caught inthe
middle of the fray as the SGA
denied their request for a charter

based on a policy in their by-

laws.
But if the relationship be-
tween God and Davidson was

unclear, so was the one between
men and women. “Gender relations”

says.

Incident just
one of many
this month

campus police have noticed a rise
in crime'on campus. Although
these events are seemingly unre-

themselves in compromising situ-

The largest of these incidents
was a full-scale drug bust that hap-
pened Friday, April 19th in Martin
Court Building F — according to
campus police, the “largest in cam-
pus history.”

The incident ended with a non-
