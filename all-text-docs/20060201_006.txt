Union Board announces potential spring act

By ZAcK TUROWSKI
Staff Writer

Last week, the Union Board Concert
Committee announced its plans for the
spring concert, which will be held in April in
the Baker Sports Arena. While no artist has
been confirmed, plans have been. set in
motion to host Bob Dylan, the students’
number two choice in a campus wide poll
sent out last fall.

The committee contacted Dylan with him
a generous offer that nearly matched the one
made to Dave Matthews for his 2003 per-
formance. Since the fall concert with Better
than Ezra was a charity event, the Union
Board had more money to offer for the
Spring act.

It remains to be seen whether or not Dylan
will accept the offer, but Concert Committee
Chairperson Erin Doyle ‘08 said the commit-
tee is strongly pursuing him.

“We made the most aggressive offer possi-
ble within our means,” said Doyle, “and we
will hopefully have an answer before spring
break.”

To develop the list of artists for their polls,
the committee used More Music Group, an
agency that acts as both an intermediary
between artists and venues as well as a book-
ing agent.

The committee then compiles a top ten list
based on the cost of various artists.

’ The committee
selected Dylan,
the number two
artist on the list,
because the num-
ber one __ per-
former was not
touring this
spring.

“We had more
than 750 students
say that they
would come to
see Bob Dylan,”
said Doyle. “Out
of 1341 students
who responded to
the survey, over
half the students
that responded
said they would
pay to see him.”

Doyle also said
that “this is the
highest number
of students we
have ever had respond saying that they
would attend a campus concert.”

Should he decide to come, the grizzled
folk rocker would be a giant generational
leap from Davidson’s more recent popular
performers, which include the Black Eyed
Peas and Better than Ezra.

Images speak for the actors
in Malick’s ‘New World’

By STEVE KALISKI
Senior Staff Writer

Just in case you still trust the advertise-
ments, let me assure you that “The New
World” is not a Colin Farrell movie.

In fact, this exuberantly unorthodox epic
refuses to rely on any of the qualities often
associated with the Irish actor.

Although Farrell receives top billing for
his portrayal of John Smith, his standards of
egotism, obtrusiveness, glamour and noisi-
ness are all absent from screen.

No, “The New World” is not a Colin
Farrell movie. Rather, it is a Terrence Malick
movie through and through.

Of course, Malick, who also directed “The
Thin Red Line,” does not bear as many pop-
ular connotations as Farrell, but the reclusive
director of this meditative, imagistic film
nonetheless totes his own bag of controver-
sial tricks.

So, from this point forward, consider

yourself warned. If you have any intention of .

enjoying, respecting and staying awake dur-
ing “The New World,” be aware of what you
are getting yourself into.

If you walk in expecting a lucid historical
study or a bombastic adventure, you will
undoubtedly suffer from confusion and
excruciating boredom.

Quiet, deliberate and visually wondrous,
“The New World” depicts the English settle-
ment of Jamestown and the assimilation of
Pocahontas, played by newcomer Q’Orianka
Kilcher, with the trust that a picture will
speak a thousand words.

The film does not approach drama in a tra-
ditional sense; Malick uses very little dia-
logue, and when the actors do talk, they
speak in either muted tones or in contempla-
tive voiceovers.

Instead, the director creates conflicts with
his images. Throughout the entire picture,
the lush, muggy naturalness of Native
American Virginia challenges the drab, dry
artificiality of the English settlers for

supremacy .

For example, when Pocahontas’s commu-
nity exiles her from the tribe and she must
find a new home amongst the English,
Kilcher voices very little of her turmoil in
shifting universes. However, when we see
her first bathing with soap and squeezing
herself into a Western dress, Malick’s images
succeed magically in capturing the drama of
the situation.

In short, the lyrical and languid New
World triumphs as a consistent juxtaposition
of visuals. When John Rolfe, played by
Christian Bale, returns to England with
Pocahontas by his side, Malick achieves his
climatic contrast; here, the young girl raised
in the simplicity of the eastern woodlands
must adapt to her own new world of cobble-
stone and concrete.

Kilcher, who was 14 at the time of filming,
is so in sync with Malick’s vision that she
creates the film’s only dynamic character. |

Her shift from playful tribal youth to wise
woman of the world—maybe a coming-of-
age, maybe a tragic loss of identity—pro-
vides the heartbreaking core of the story.

In a scene at the end of the film, Farrell
actually does some of the strongest work of
his career, but Smith disappears from the
movie for such long stretches that the char-
acter cannot sustain much sympathy.

Similarly, the talented Bale does not make
his entrance as Rolfe until the film has
already begun its final act.

Regarding historical accuracy, Malick
makes a much nobler attempt than Disney,
who cleaned up this complex tale in
“Pocahontas” for the sake of a widespread
audience.

Malick respects the age difference
between Smith and Pocahontas, though he
does still tend toward romance in a relation-
ship that was probably more paternal.

If you go to see “The New World,” truly
go to see it. Malick, one of the few auteurs
remaining in Hollywood, redefines his medi-
um with every frame. If you can open your-
self up to the new world of Malick’s film-

making, you probably will enjoy it.

Bob Dylan in his younger days

Doyle said
that respons-
es to the stu-
dent survey

support for
artists from
every genre
of music
except, coun-
try.
“Our stu-
dents enjoy a
wide range
of musical
styles,” she
said. “T
admire our
students for
appreciating
[Dylan].”

While
Dylan’s
celebrity sta-
tus is encour-
aging to
some, there are others who question the fea-
sibility of securing such a renowned per-
former, especially after the school was
scorned by the likes of Ludacris, Dave
Chappelle and Jon Stewart.

James Wells, ’07, is “still not convinced
that announcing Dylan isn’t a cover for the

tesy photo

indicated.

Colin Farrell and Q’Orianka Kilcher share a romantic moment as John Smith and

fact that the only act thaf we can afford who

-will play here is Third' Eye Blind. “

“IT mean, the last several concerts have
been awful: Cosby, Derek Trucks, Black
Eyed Peas, nobody, Better than Ezra,” said
Wells. “Now ask yourself which act fits with
that group better: Dylan or Third Eye
Blind?”

Third Eye Blind was only one of the many
other performers on the poll sent out to the
student body.

However, the overall atmosphere on cam-
pus is one of excitement.

“If Bob Dylan comes, it will be a cultural-
ly enriching experience for the Davidson
community,” said Matt Somers ’07, a mem-
ber of the jazz ensemble.

As for the disappointing results of the
Black Eyed Peas concert, Doyle said that
“the drop-off in sales was on the side of the
general public, not the students.”

Such a scenario will likely not be a prob-
lem with the legendary Bob Dylan.
Regardless, it will be several weeks before
the campus finds out whether or not the bid
submitted to Dylan was accepted.

The concert will be held in the Belk Arena

>

and tickets will be available for purchase
through the Davidson box office in the
Union.

Should Dylan decide to come, tickets will
be $35 for students and $45 for the general
public.
