Christian Dogma Vs.Social [ils

BY JOHN COOK
Staff Writer

On Wednesday, March 13,
Calvin Malefyt completed a
series of lectures that were
oriented to human social
problems and attempting to
provide a Christian solution
for those problems.

In Ann, Arbor. Michigan,
Malefyt is the minister of the
University of the Reformed
Church where he engages in
a Christian witness to mem-
bers of the campus communi-
ty. His academic credentials

are impressive, and _ his
specialty is the field of
psychology.

Counseling students and
others from his area, Malefyt
is interested in announcing the
Christian answer to the
dilemmas of modern man.
Man, in his biblical view, is
fallen and must be redeemed
inside before any solution to
any human problem can be
found.

The lectures dealt with the
pathetic state of American
society, sexuality, distressed
young people, humanists, and
most other ills.

in general are not to be

the responsibility and must

Reality.” The extensive ex-
perience that Malefyt has had
in counseling enabled him to
provide many penetrating in-
sights into the negative side of
human sexuality. He often
quoted psychologists in his
judgements on _ sexual
relations, and he gave many
examples of unhappy couples
that had indulged in pre-
marital sex.

In his discussion of
sexuality, he condemned three
points of view: the treatment
of man as a commodity to be
manipulated and exploited
(such as the way sex is used in
advertising); the belief that
man’s sexuality is purely
biological (where sex
becomes a cup of water); and
the limitation of man’s being
solely to his sexual nature.

Sexuality taken as the
totality of human existence is
a barometer of emptiness. In
this case sex becomes an ex-
pression of neurotic ten-
dencies. Men and women are
unable to relate with each
other.

The reaction to this state is
non commitment to other
humans, new kinds of
moralistic asceticism, new
forms of voyeurism, and
meaningless communal sex.

After a long analysis of this
unhappy aspect of sexuality,
Malefyt presented the

istian answer in a nutshell.
Man and woman are created
in the image of God; thus sex
is a gift to be enjoyed in terms
of total, spiritual person. Sex
cannot be separated from the
individual's complete self.
The reality of Jesus Christ is
to govern all human relation-
ships.

again to the negative side of
human life. Divorces, violent
student protests, crimes, and
many other social ills are due
to the individual’s inability to
relate to others and to deal ef-
fectively with his anger.

In investigating this
phenomenon, Malefyt did not
neglect the smiling Christian
who must constantly conceal
the seething anger inside
himself.

Frustrated people direct.

their hostility toward the
government, the president, or
some other scapegoat in order
that they might ignore their
own personal situations.
Protests against war end in
violent deaths. Families shoot
each other.

After this drawn out
description of the problem,
Malefyt quoted several Bible
verses to corroborate his
response to the situation. He
affirmed the necessity of faith
to deal with anger and to ex-
press one’s anger in con-
structive ways. His solution
was extremely brief.

The address on free love
was basically the same as the
others. Men mistakenly put
their love in books, dogs,
pleasure, and other material
things. Eros is used to block
anxiety and anger. Love is not
enough to answer man’s
needs. The free love of God is

necessary to enable men to
love one another.

The response to Malefyt has
been enthusiastic among more
conservative Christian
students, but there is a
general dissatisfaction among
many others including some
members of the faculty and
administration. The lectures
were rambling and loosely
organized, and the solutions
that Dr. Malefyt proposed
were often simplistic and un-
fulfilling.

Some critics think that his
Sunday evening lecture did
not succeed in drawing a con-
nection between the failing
American Dream and the
Christian answer. Listeners to
the talk on sexuality were told
that they should turn to Jesus
Christ for guidance in human
relationships.

Though Christi a
this, the answer is not
adequately effective and is
ambiguous in its concrete im-
plications for human life.

extremely disorganized, and
Malefyt did not have enough
time to express his Christian
response in a _ constructive
fashion. As in the case of the
lecture on sexuality, telling
people to accept Jesus Christ
only begins to solve the
problem. One member of the
administration remarked that

quoting a few Bible verses was
simply not enough to help one
deal with the situation.

Malefyt’s analysis of free
love ended with the conclusion
that if one loves God one can
experience the ‘‘correct’’ kind
of human love. This ambiguity
is difficult to apply to
everyday life.

The man is a curious com-
bination of conservative
theology and a liberal social
outlook. He is involved in

social activitism and does not
shy away from political
issues.
