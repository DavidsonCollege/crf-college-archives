day that they had been granted
Watson. Fellowships, which will

They were two of four Davidson

nine different countries in Western

Self Study
concludes
women’s
experiences
not ideal ©

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL
Assistant News Editor

In their investigation and
analysis of the “Student Experi-
ence” at Davidson College, a 14
member Self-Study Committee
found that several “aspects of cam-
pus life did not fully reflect the
ideal student experience.”

Self-Study Sertes

One group of students whose
campus experience was deemed to
“differ from the ideal” is women.

Due to the fact that women
make up nearly 50% of Davidson’s
student body, over 10% of the sec-
tion evaluating the Student Expe-

rience falls under the heading —

“Women Student Concerns.”
Drawing from information
obtained through Self-Study Com-

mittee interviews with Warner and

Connor Eating House members,
Self-Study Student Survey data, as
well as discussions with the Col-
lege Women’s Concerns Commit-
tee and students pursuing concen-
trations in gender studies, the Self-
Study compiled a variety of infor-
mation concerning the aspects of
female students‘ life at Davidson.

Some of the Self-Study Com-
mittee findings, published in the
1995-96 Self-Study report; include

a documentary on popular and re-
ligious icons and their fans.

“T’ll be making a performance
art piece which combines costumes
and an art set based on relics gath-
ered on the trip,” says Hankins.

She will be meeting with the
fan clubs of Elvis Presley, of which
there are 170 internationally, at-
tending night clubs and bars in
Tokyo to study the emulation of
Marilyn Monroe, making a pil-
grimage to the grave of Jim
Morrison in Paris on the anniver-
sary of his death, and visiting the
Reeper Bahn in Hamburg where
the Beatles first made it big.

“At the same time,” says
Hankins, “T’Il be studying national

religious icons such as Saint
Theresa and Saint Catherine to
compare the religious and pop
devotionalisms.”
Hankins was inspired by En-
glish Professor Gail Gibson and
her own love of Marilyn Monroe
and Elvis Presley. “I feel so lucky

to have this opportunity,” she adds, ’

Curtis will be combining her
three greatest interests: journalism,
women’s studies, and Latin
America.

She will travel to Argentina,
Chile, Mexico and Nicaragua to
study women in the alternative
press. She also hopes to travel to
Peru and Cuba.

drawn up plans fora Southern stud-
ies concentration.

Southern studies will be the
sixthconcentration in the Davidson
curriculum, joining neuroscience,

gender studies, ethnic studies, ap-

plied mathematics, and interna-
tional studies.

Recognizing that the college
already offered 19 courses focus-
ing on the South, the faculty enthu-
siastically approved the proposal.

Smith calls the concentration
a “natural for Davidson.” He says,
“it’s time to take the opportunity to
look at the South anew. There’s a
lot of attention on regionalism in
the world anyway, and there’s an
interest in what the South is now

’ that it may not have been before.

This is neither a caricature of the
South nor a call for Southern na-
tionalism. It’s a way to look at
ourselves in a different way and
project a kind of difference with-
out superiority or inferiority.”
McMillen whoalready teaches
courses in “The New South,” “The
Old South,” “The Civil War,” and
“Southern Women” holds high
hopes for the new concentration.
She comments, “The South is so
fascinating ... I think this will at-
