REIDINGS

By BOB REID
Assistant Sports Editor

Dr. Tom Scott has announced plans for blacktopping
“at least half” of the present baseball field to make room
for much needed parking facilities.

The proposed paving is one of the recommended
changes in the physical plant suggested by the Self-Study
Evaluation Report. However, informed sources tell THE
DAVIDSONIAN that this is only the first step in a mas
sive plan to turn the entire campus into a giant parking
lot.

“This summer we plan to begin paving the new base-
ball field,” our source announced. “The athletic office
was a bit reluctant to pave over the baseball field so soon
after its completion, but after carcful study and evalua-
tion we decided that the student body wouldn’t care any-
way, since nobody ever watches baseball games. Also, the
paved parking area would be a great place to take a
date!”

When asked if the asphalt diamond might make base
running a. bit hazardous, the informer shrugged, “We
don’t think that problem will ever arise.”

RICHARDSON PAVING PLANNED

“Richardson Field offers all Kinds of possibilities for
parking areas,” he continued. “During games we can park
cars around the field and then ask spectators to turn on
their lights for night games. The saving on the electrical
bills might even pay another instructor’s salary.”

Playing on a paved field might conceivably result in
a few rule changes,” he added, “like a mandatory aid
count for tackled runners. Anyhow, the contact will be
good for muscle tones. If too many injuries result, we
can always turn the field into a giant handball court.”

Once the athletic fields have been paved, infinite pos-
sibilities for parking lots still remain.

“The Assistant Dean contracted the Young Paving
Company to re-do the Patterson Court area last year, but
we decided to table these plans for future use. Certain
faculty representatives have told us to hang onto the
plans for a few more years.”

“Somebody suggested paving the Lingle Manor prop-
erty, but the faculty demanded that we respect the sanc-
tity of such a vital and useful facet of campus life. They
suggested we use the literary society halls instead. (Man-
or representative David Weems was available for un-
printable comment.)

POSSIBILITIES ENDLESS

Our source continued to show us that the Davidson
property has more possibilities for spaces than the Meck-
lenburg Hotel.

“Think of the possibilities.” he shrieked. “We could
tear down some useless building like Cunningham Hall
and pave it over the very next day. The students would
never notice the change.”

‘Our ambitions don't stop there either,” he ha-
rangued. “As soon as they do away with compulsory Ves-
ers, we'll have plenty of space west of the Dana Build-
ing. There’s plenty of room on. front campus between
Chambers and downtown Davidson. although I under-
stand that the Hill has plans to convert that area into
the Charlie Scott Memorial Park if he signs here. or a
cemetery for Coach Driesell if he goes elsewhere.

“We thought about sticking one car in the Rare Book
Room, but we decided to build a handball court there

instead.”

“The drill field will accommdate dozens of cars,”
drooled the informer. “As soon as Dan Mombrea gets rid
of compulsory ROTC, we should get all the space we
need.”

“After we exhaust all those possibilities, we may be
a little pushed for additional space,” pondered our in-
former. “But personally, I’m not worried. By the time
the athletic department has paved all those areas, the
freshman dorms will have collapsed from decay!

Congratulations to Harry’s Foglemen, who are on
their way to another conference title. If golf tops the con-
ference too, that will make three conference titles for
the Wildcats this year!

KA’S KEEP PACE

Beta-Ballers Pace IMAC
Through Thursday’s Tilts

The “unusual” dominated this week’s IMAC competition as the Betas held on
to first place'and the envy-monster crawled on to the KA’s because of it.

The KA's have only to see
the Betas get dumped once to
knot their records at 81. The
SPE’s who had followed them
opened the gates as the once
defeated E’s charged into third
with their 4-1 record.

Besides having to play be-
tween the rains, almost all the
competitors had to cope with a
swarm of mistakes. The weird-
est boner came in the KA-Machi
game as Bruce Weihe hit into a
bases-loaded triple play (attrib-
uted partially to typical ster-
ling Machi running) which
thwarted an upset effort in the
seventh inning.

The KA's, who also dumped
the Pikas, 9-7, and the Indies,
14-5, claim they’re starting to
roll despite Tommy Hunter's
zero hits for his last 11 bats.

The Kappa Sigs used P Tow-
er's golden glove and Arnie
Goodstein’s ‘fierce’ bat to put
down the winless Independent's
10-5 earlier in .the week. “It
was significant."* quipped a Sig.

-“‘that Goodstein was hitless and

fanned twice in that game.”

During the course of the day,
seven meet records werc brok.

New records were set in the
distance medley relay, high

Of these records, only the pole
vault, won by East Carolina, was
not set by the Buccaneers.

Coach Heath Whittle expressed
pleasure at the over-all running
of the meet. ‘‘We hope to con-

THE DAVIDSONIAN

By K. D. WEEKS

The Pikas slipped by the Nus
11-10 in yesterday's game. Nu
Bill Skinner misjudged a_ dif-
ficult and crucial fly ball near
the game's end as the Pikas
upped their record to 3-4.

“Bob O'Kelly and several oth-
er Pikas were really ‘up’ for
the game, and manager Sonny
Graves made several trips to the
mound for conferences with
pitcher Johnn§ Gresham, in his
initial game as ‘coach,’ ‘’ com-
mented a Nu after the game.

Even more oddities caused
the Phi Gams to fall to the un-
defeated Beats 9-7. It was
“Doug Rhymes Day" on the
field as he booted a slow roller
from his second base position
down a hill to the lower field
and later slid over the bag in
an attempt to steal second. It
was the game's last out and the
Gam rally was crushed. Beta
Joc Rice hit two homers and
Fiji Gary Peklo went four for
five at the plate.

Asked how the meet went inre

lation lo his expectations, Whit-,

tle said. “It was just about like
I thought, considering ‘all the in
juries we have had during the

season. East Tennessee was just.

too strong. I think we'll’ be in
the running again next year, hav
ing won it six of. eight times.”

Whittle admitted that the bal
ance of the field was getting
stronger each year and that
without East Tennessee ‘there
would have been a real dog
fight.

East Carolina nosed out David-
son with 25 points to grab third
place honors with the ‘Cats
matching P C with 24.

ONLY BASEBALL WIN

Kittens Clobber CMA Twice}

By YATES FAISON
Davidsonian Assistant Sports Editor

The Wildkitten baseballers waited until their final
turn at bat this year to delete the “winless” tag from
their record, defeating Carolina Military Academy, 3-0,
Tuesday afternoon.

Clutch hits by Ray Logan, Bob Apgar, and Dave
Fearnbach plus heads-up baserunning produced a three-
run rally in the sixth to break a scoreless tie and net the
3-0 win. Mackey Reavis twirled a two-hitter to earn the
shutout win despite a sore arm.

COACH PLEASED

Coach Tom Stevens expressed pleasure in the sea-
son’s finale, labelling Reavis’ job “the first shutout I can
remember — including the varsity — in quite a while.
Mackey did real well pitching a two-hitter. He and (Bill)
Love are going to have to make it as varsity pitchers.

The big rally began with a walk to Ronny Brown,
who went on to second on a balk and dented the plate
following Logan’s sharp double to left-center. Apgar fol-
lowed with a solid single to right, plating Logan with an
insurance run, and alertly raced all the way to third dur-
ing a bit of confusion. Fearnbach’s single scored Apgar
with the clincher.

LITTLE CHANCE TO PRACTICE

Coach Stevens was happy at the prospects for next

year but lamented the lack of opportunity for practice

this year. “Several boys can

at it. The lack of practice time and facilities this
interference. Next year both]:

hurt us, along with weather

help the varsity if they work

teams (varsity and freshman) will have practice space.”

Apgar echoed Stevens’

sentiments. “I don’t believe

[Clayton chalked up two RBI's

ear |'

the team lived up to its potential. We had a better team
than we showed, but due to lack of practice, we never
had much chance to develop.”

Stevens praised Logan as a hitting prospect, Hank
Strickland for his catching potential, Frank Murphy, “a

good outfield, but must improve his hitting,” and his in-|&

fielders and pitching staff.
RUNNERS TAKE SECOND
Coach Heath Whittle’s freshman track squad placed
second in a three-way meet here Tuesday, falling to

Gardner-Webb, 63-45, while besting Carolina Military||

Academy, 45-33.

_ “We could have won over Gardner-Webb,” explained
Whittle, “but Greg Cox was on the injury list, having
been hurt in football practice, and could only compete
in the broad jump. We could have had four more firsts.”

Whittle was especially pleased with the performance
of George Rogister, who turned in a time of 15.9 sec-
onds in the low hurdles. Rogister led the Davidson fresh-
men with eight points in the meet.

Whittle also cited Wayne Huckel in the javelin, Ed-
die Rice in the 440 and Mike Moats in the 880.

Clemson Match

By CLIFF DUKE
Davidsonian Sports Wrtier

Yesterday .afternoon the Wild.
eats journeyed into the Clemson
Tiger lair and left licking their
wounds from a 7-2 setback.
Peter Parrott in the singles and
the doubles team of Dick Hurd
and. Woody Faulk salvaged the
‘only victories of the afternoon.

However, according to Coach
Harry Fogleman, the final score
“did not indicate the closeness
of the contest. Six of the
matches went three sets. and
we won the first set.in five of
those.”

Rain handicapped the. David-
son efforts. ‘They have soft
courts with no base—like ours—
so the match was shifted to
asphalt courts. They were about
the fastest I've ever seen.”

HAPPIER DAYS

But the weather was pleasant,
the hospitality congenial and the
competition exacting, and the
results of VMI's tournament last
weekend had a familiar. pre-
dictable ring to them. David-
son College's tennis team eas-
ily beat the host Keydets,
George Washington, and West,
Virginia, serving notice to the
conference members that they
again intend to dominate the
tournament at the close of the
season.

A couple of weeks ago. in
looking forward to these three
matches, Coach Fogleman had
asserted that the Wildcat hopes
following a powerful drive. ‘‘Ru-| of retaining conference laurels
fus Adair was not at his best;lay in the stern challenge they
in. that game,” added a Tau.| offered. VMI was playing on its

‘about a two-hitter,"’ comment-
ed an uncertain player after the
game. Bruce Weihe redeemed
his performance against the
KA’s by hitting a grand slam
to blow the game wide open.

The Pi Kapps may still have
been in the clouds after tak-
ing their first win Tuesday, a
9-5 victory over the SPE’‘s.

The ATO’s whipped the Sigma
Nu's 15-8 Tuesday and the SPE's
yesterday 10-0. Both games
highlighted the amazing power
of Jim Stokes. Once in the rain,
he even made it to third, after

ginia people considered their
netmen to be as good as any
recent. Mountaineer squad.

But desire, confidence. and
depth supplied the impetus. for
Davidson to march in quick
time through the :three day af.
fair, energing victorious in
all bul one of the twenty seven
decisions. Only Bill Council lost,
dropping a singles match to his
GW opponent.

GOOD PERFORMANCE

Coach .Fogleman cited every-
one fot good performances.
“We just overpowered all three.
George Washington was the best
team we faced, but we still lost
only 10 games to them in all.
Tt was the same way with the
others. We have depth, with
good players all the way down.”

“This’ deal was just a round-
robin in which VMI invited three
teams. I was well pleased with
our performance, but winning
this easily does not’ assure win-
ning the conference tournament.
GW, especialy, will give us a
rough time.

TOUGH ROAD AHEAD

In the coming week, the Wild-
cats will venture outside the
conference and into rugged com-
petition. Tomorrow they enter-
tain Emory University, whese
team last year forced a long,
hard match for the ‘Cats.

On Monday they travel South
to trade volleys with a Game-
cock squad composed mainly
of scholarship boys.

After hosting Erskine on Tues.
day, Davidson. will entertain the
Blue Devils of Duke Thursday.

ference. We're all just about to-

gether in wins and Josses—-there

have been a lot of upsets.’ As
for a scouting report. he said,
“AN T. know is that they are
supposed to. have one real good
‘pitcher. But we'll have to see.””

The Citadel beat VMI 32 and
1-0, while the ‘Cats beat VMI
6-5 and Jost 2-1. This would in-
dicate some close games and
some good bascball in store.
