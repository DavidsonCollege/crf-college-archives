WDAV-FM Expands
For Local Alternative

PAUL WELCH
Staff Reporter

After a long period of con-
struction and testing, WDAV
Radio has finally begun
regularly scheduled broad-
casting in an FM frequency of
90.5 megahertz.

Formerly a carrier current
A.M. station, WDAV was tran-
sformed into an F.M. station
over the summer months of
1973, and may now be heard in
the town of Davidson and the
immediate surrounding com-
munity, as well as in the college
dormitories.

The change from carrier
current A.M. to § free-
broadcasting F.M. has brought
with it corresponding changes
in programming and emphasis.

Classical music program-
ming, for example, has been ex-
panded from two to three hours
nightly in response to the ex-
pressed desire of members of
the Davidson community for
more such music.

When asked about this and
other changes in programming,
co-station manager Scott Reid
said, “‘WDAV is attempting to
provide a true alternative to
present local stations, which
have been sadly lacking as far
as serious musical program-
ming is concerned.”’

“In the area of public service
broadcasting, the station will be
presenting such educational
programs as the British Broad-
casting Corporation's ‘‘Science
Magazine” and National Public
Radio's ‘‘All Things Con-
sidered’, an interview-oriented
commentary on current affairs.

News programming will tend
to be centered around campus
and community affairs, rather
than state or national news.

“Just as THE DAVID-
SONIAN cannot be expected to
cover national news as well as
the Charlotte Observer does,

WDAYV will not try to out-do the
Charlotte area stations.

“In news we'll be covering
what the Charlotte stations
can’t do as well as we can-—the
local on-and-off campus news,
and the national news as it af-
fects people on a local level,”
said Reid.

“‘T am glad to see that WDAV
has finally gone FM. I hope that
now WDAV can assist THE
DAVIDSONIAN in the presen-
tatio and coverage of weekly
campus news and events,”
DAVIDSONIAN Editor Alec
Hoon remarked.

As far as sports program-
ming is concerned, WDAV is
planning to broadcast all away
football games live.

All home basketball games
which will not be carried on
WBT Radio of Charlotte will

also be broadcast by the college
station.
Recently, the station has

ordered several pieces of new
equipment, the most import-
ant of these being a con-
trol board which has been
promised to them by WBT.

When this board is installed,
it will in effect give the station
two operating studio centers,
rather than the one it now has.

The station also has a new
cartridge tape deck, and has or-
dered a new turntable.

WDAV will transmit from 7
a.m. to 1 a.m. on weekdays and

9 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Saturdays
and Sundays.

Weekday broadcasting will
begin with a program entitled
“All Day Music’, which will
consist of ‘‘soft to medium”
rock music.

At 5, the evening's ‘Classical
Concert’ will begin, to be
followed at 8 by an hour of

From 9 to 1, the hard rock
“Radio Free Davidson’ show
will be aired.

In other developments,
WDAV has established a fund
for the improvement of its
classical record library. Also in
the works is a printed guide to
programming.

Saturday afternoon airtime
will be devoted to jazz. Sundays
from 9 to 2 will be given to
religious music and programs
such as the Lutheran Church’s
‘Silhouette’.

One of the characteristics which distinguishes
Davidson from large universities is the potential for
close relationship among all members of the college
comsunity. However, ve often don't take the time to
maintain such associations.

The purpose of the weekly cokes and coffee session
is to provide an opportunity for all of us to stop for a
few minutes, meet informally, and get to know one another

We will try this experiment for the first term and
I hope that

continue it if the response is favorable.
