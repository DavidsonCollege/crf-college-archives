Davidson, N. C.

Consoling a bereaved widow, the par-

son said: “The body is only an empty
shell—the nut has gone to heaven.”

Item in newspaper — “A New York
judge held that kissing and a few cock-
tails don’t t to anything.” They
may not but it’s a mighty pleasant way
to pass a rainy evening.

All wild flowers fade quickly cxcept the
blooming idiots.

HOW TO FIND OUT
“You don’t mean it, Mabel?”
“You just kiss me and see.”
“Flake, stop!”

DO BOTH
A shiekish young dude named DuBose
Courted a girl by the name of Miss

Gross;

He a-hemmed and a-ha-ad as he sat by
her side—

“T’'ll hug you and kiss you,” he ardently
cried,

And she lisped, “Oh, Mr. DuBoth!”

BELIEVE IT OR NOT

Last Friday a freshie went into the
reading room at the library and picked
up a “Charlotte Observer” and walking
over to a Soph, said, “How do you get
the stick off this paper?”

Wood Brown—“I can say ‘I love you’
in four different languages.”

speaks louder than words?”

Peewee McCravey says that he thought
a profile was a carpenter’s tool.

Kuykendall—“Ever see one of those
machines that can tell when a fellow is
lying?”

Solter—“Seen one?
ried one!”

Why, man I mar-

“What makes you think Billy Rice has
a wooden leg?”

“He stopped at a store last week to
get some garters and came out with a
box of thumb tacks.”

Diamond Dick McCarty—“My Sis is com-
ing out next spring.”
Bowic—“What was she sent up for?”

Tom Baker says—“Many a truth is ut-
tered through false teeth.”

Woodrow Wilson—“Have you a theory
on kissing?”

“No, I care only for applied science,”
said his girl.

“Is that the same car you had last
spring?”

Speight Adams—"“Yes, same car except
the engine, body, and three new wheels.”

ADDER UP
“Cleopatra was not the only one the
adder finished,” said the bookkeeper as
he grabbed the handle of his Burroughs
again.

Fats Laws — “Do gooseberries have
legs?”

Christenberry—“No, why?”

Fats—“Then I must have swallowed a
catapillar.”

“Johnnie, your face is nice and clean,
but how did you get your hands so
dirty?”

“Washin’ me face.”

Licutenant Thompson (to Fresh who is
number onc, frant rank)—“Con you hold a
pivot?”

Fresh—‘I don’t know,.I haven't been is-
sued one, yet.”

Ist Midshipman—‘I had an _ interest-
ing experience the other day. I came
across a man floundering around-in the

water, holding on to a keg.”

Her —. “Don’t you know that action

2nd MidS.—“You effected a rescue, I
suppose?”

Ist MidS.—“Well, yes, you see I had to
hit the fellow over the head with an oar,
but I finally got the keg on board.”

A hardboiled Soph had a freshie cry-
ing last night when he told him that af-
ter Christmas they are going to begin
feeding freshmen to the wildcat.

“Excuse me,” she said as she entered
the country editor's office. “You editors
are supposed to know everything. How

|should I treat sick bees?”

“With respect, madam,” was the ans-

wer,

Teacher—“Who signed Magia Char-
ta?”

Youngest—"Please, ma‘'am, ’Twasn’t
me.”
Teacher (disgusted)—“Oh, take your

seat.”

Skeptical Member of School Board —
“Here, call that boy back. I don’t like
his manner. I believe he did do it.”

A Pacific coast hotel, popular with
traveling salesmen, sent this wire:
Applebaum & Goldblatt, New York City.

“Your salesman, Sam Goldstein, died
here today. What shall we do?”

The hotel manager received this reply:

“Search his pockets for orders.”

We know a girl whose hair is a crown
of glory, but she abdicates every night.

Prof. —‘What is tt a sign of when a boy
never passes anything?”
Stude—‘Poor table manners.”

“NOW YOU CHASE ME A WHILE
“You sure can dance.”
“Oh yes, I love to.”
“Then we'll love.”

A DIRTY STORY

Voice Over Phone—“Are you the lady
that washes?”

“No!”

V. O. P.—“You dirty Thing!”

Andy Hewlett—‘My roommate doesn’t
smoke, drink, chew, dance, cuss, or fight.”

“Does he make his own dresses, too?”

“Annie,” called her mistress, “just come
into the dining room a moment. Now
look at this. Watch me. I can write
my name in the dust on this table.

Annie grinned. “It must be a grand
thing,” she said, “to have an education.”

“She doesn’t. He just gets that way.”

At a meeting of the Reporters’ Club

G. M. Eddington.

A. H. Hollingsworth.

R. B. Parker.

W. H. Branch.

W. T. Covington.

ing won the distinction at a former date.
