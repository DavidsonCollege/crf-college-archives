STILL PUZZLED BY A LETTER he received from a

Time out for your studies and mine for
a friendly chat. First, we should get acquaint-
ed: I'm a sophomore at Winthrop College, and
for the sake of not knowing your name, (‘il
call you Dave (for Davidson). There: intro.
ductions are over.

Being gragerious, I’ve always been curious
to know who has the same box number as
mine at your school—this will be interesting!

Since I’m from Florida, | don’t know much
about your college; however, | do know it is
a fine Presbyterian school.

1 know since you're near Charlotte there
is no lack for things to do, and if you are
like the rest of us you look forward to those
“good times” on the weekend.

Since it’s the time of year when those
things called exams descend on us without
mercy, here’s wishing you good luck and that
you'll ace them ail.

Well, I've enjoyed ‘talking to you,” but it’s
time now to make the fourth in bridge.

Time out from your studies and mine for

Hoping to hear from you soon.

Winthropy,
Miss 631

“She was right about exams,” Gross said. “I had so
many papers and tests to grade that I never did get
around to answering it. I read it to my freshman English
classes, and my wife enjoyed it, too.”

THE DAVIDSONIAN feature staff spent a half hour
on the telephone trying to locate Miss 631. A co-operative
young long distance operator who frankly admitted that
she had no plans for the coming week-end herself, dialed
every dormitory at Winthrop College in pursuit of the
mysterious young lady.

“We accept calls for girls, not serial numbers.” the
Winthrop matrons rasped. “Could we speak to her room-
mate?” the operator asked sweetly. Despite these at-
tempts, the writer could not be found.

“What's YOUR box number?” the telephone operator
whispered after cancelling the call. “I hear you Davidson
guys are super cool.”

Professor Gross will have the last word in the matter,
however. “I think this would make a good assignment
for my freshman classes when we take up letter writing.”

These are the questions posed
by the Methodist Student Fel-

answers, the Fellowship is con-

called A Second Look at Sex.

The first stage of this pro-

or advised to withdraw who has
earned nine hours and six qual-

er,” Dean Bailey stated. “Only
those students below these lev-
els have been subject to such
action.”

COMMITTEE DECIDES

The “nine and six rule” is
found in the college's “Regula-
tions For Students.” Under its
provisions, all students failing
to meet the standards will eith-
er be placed on academic proba-
tion or required to leave, the de-
cision being left to the discre-
tion of the Executive Commit-
tee.

Eight students were required
to leave following first semest-
er; two of these had left volun-
tarily before their cases came
before the committee. An ad-
ditional 14 were put on proba-
tion.

“I wouldn’t say these figures
were overly jarge,”’’ Dean Bailey
commented. “There is nothing

Two Debate Teams

Next Thursday, two Davidson

Representing Davidson in the

In addition to the regular de-

team members may enter other

FIVE SOPHS

Five of the required with-
drawals were sophomores, while
there were two juniors and one
senior. Freshmen are not dis-
missed at the end of one semes-
ter. However, five freshmen
were placed on probation.

Approximately 30 students
did not return for the second
semester. This number includ-
ed the eight withdrawals plus
transfers, graduates, drop-outs
and men studying at other
schools for the semester only.

Registrar F. W. Hengeveld re-
ported that this number was
normal. The usual net differ-
ence is a loss of 25, he explain-
ed. With the addition of four
returning students and one
transfer, the difference is ex-
actly that number.

underachievement is now in ef-

was not a closed matter. ‘“Sever-

ture,” added Covington, “pos-
sibly at the end of this month.

“This sale would be mostly of
books that we now have in
stock which have not sold too
well.. We will sell these at a
reduced rate in order to make
room for new orders.

‘All of the orders we make
are for books requested by the
professors,” stated Covington.
These, however, are not limited

to those required for the pro-, Congress during

fessors' courses.

Covington and Bill Moss, the;
Assistant Manager. said that’
some profit has been made on
the Union Book Store this year.
Inventory has been taken, but:
the figures have not been cor-
rected yet.

“The rumor that a $2000
profit was made last semester
is definitely not true,” said
Moss. “Any profit we do
make goes back into the bud-
get for reordering books,”
Covington added.

The long-searched-for name
for. the book store has still not
yet been determined. The con-
test held early last semester
failed to provide a satisfactory
name. Possibilities are under
consideration now, and the man-
agers hope to announce some-
thing definite on this subject
soon.

Covington and Moss said that
it would be hard to cite the
single book that ranks as “best
seller” in the Union Book Store.
However, they ‘ mentioned the
popularity of the poems of Ar-
chibald MacLeish, “J.B.” by
MacLeish, the College Outline
Series books, and many of the

‘Modern Library Series volumes.

?'Bailey Explains Policy
On ‘Underachievement’

There is no program or policy for combatting “underachievement” in use by
the college at this time. Dean of Students John C. Bailey, Jr. emphasized the non-
\| existence of any such policy this week in response to a growing student misconcep-
| tion.

al of us who feel we should
move in that general direction
are thinking about it informal-
ly, but. there is no formal study.
“There is no systematic pro-
gtam for underachievers. The
idea is sound, but must be stud-
ied carefully. Such a program
could do much injustice.”
Dean Bailey pointed out that
the only approximation to such
4 program now at Davidson is
consultations with students and
parents, which are a regular ac-
tivity of the dean’s office.

Criticisms Bring Changes
In Mass Lecture Program

Heads of the physics and psychology departments

cussion group programs initiated last semester in eval-
uations for THE DAVIDSONIAN this week.

Dr. W. G. Workman indicated
that several changes were being
made in the psychology pro-
gram this semester, because
the department was dissatisfied
with the effectiveness of the
system, especially in the discus-
sion groups.

The physics program is
working out quite successful-
ly, though, according to Dr.
C. J. Pietenpol. However, he
felt he could not view the
program objectively and wel-
comed any student comment
in improving the classes.
Pietenpo!l commented that he
had always taught under this
system before he came to Dav-
idson.
