ATHLETIC NEWS

On the Gridiron

Revenge is sweet, but still we have
only an even break with P. C. The first
game between the two institutions ended
a o-o tie. Last year P. C. took the long
end of a 7-0 clash. This year evened the
honors.

—Wildcats—

“Tech in Atlanta.” ‘Those fatal words
have appeared on Davidson’s and many
others schedules during the past few
years, and in almost every case it has
spelled defeat for Tech’s opponents. In
1917 the Wildcats made a name for them-
selves by being the only team to score
over one touchdown on the Golden Tor-
nado that year. Since then they have
not done quite so well, but this year the
Engineers will face a machine in every
way worthy to bear the name Wildcats,
and the story may be different when the
final whistle blows Saturday.

—Wildcats—

Get out Friday and give the team that
same big old send off. Kick over the
pepper box and show ’em we're backing
them, win or loose, tothe limit.

—Wildcatse——

Furman continued her victorious be:
ginning by adding Erskine to her string
63-0. Indeed, they will be strong oppon-
ents on Thanksgiving day.

—Wildcatse——

In intersectional contests last Satur-
day the North and South split even. The
Middies swamped N. C. State, while
Maryland took a hard fought game from
Rutgers by a margin of three points.

—Wildcats

Wake Forest, week after next, looms
upon the horizon as a strong opponent.
Heckman seems to be their “ace in the
hole.” He is versatile, being able to
punt, pass, or run with the ball.

—Wildcats

Carolina takes on Yale Saturday. The
Yale team, yet, has not shown its usual
drive and punch, so the North Caro-
linians figure they have a good chance
to plant the oval under Yale’s goal posts.
Hope they will.

—Wildcats—.

Class basketball starts tomorrow. The
Soph and Fresh, natural enemies, will
battle for supremacy on the court. The
game should be replete with thrills and
good basketball.

—Wildcats.

Following is the bill of fare for Friday
and Saturday.

Friday, October 7th

Clemson vs. P. C., at Clemson.

Saturday, October 8th

Centre vs. V. P. L, at Danville.

—Wildca:

Lafayette tied a 6-0 can to Pitt ‘last
Saturday. The defeat of the Smoky City
lad$ came as one of the biggest upsets of.
football dope in recent years. With one
minute to play, Pitt had the ball on La-
fayette’s one-yard line and in attempting
a line buck on the fourth down lost nine
yards. Pitt’s line must have been ner-
vous.

WILDCATS READY TO TACKLE
GOLDEN TORNADO OF TECH.

‘As the fog horns of the press sound
their doleful warning and the weather
prophets of sportdom serve notice of
approaching “high winds,” the deter-
(mination of the Wildcats mounts high
and-a strong defense is being worked
out to withstand: the violent onrushes of
- the “Golden Tornado.”

swept from their feet in the fury of the
tornado.

Coach Alexander is not hampered by
the lack of either old or new material
for the shaping of his stormy eleven, and
the scores of the past two games indi-
cate that the Georgia Engineers. will
make.a record this year that will out-
shine that of all past seasons.

The Wake Forest Baptists were sub-
dued by the Georgians and were forced
to accept a 42-0 defeat. The same medi-
cine Was administered to Oglethorpe
last Saturday, the final count being 41-0.

The old saying that “a team is as good
as its substitutes” will place Tech in the
front ranks of grid teams of the nation.
Their substitutes are many in number
and their playing qualities are of the
superlative degree.
fact, to name the regular men, as the
line-up, as yet, is a tentative affair.

With such men back in the harness as
Dewey Scaroboro, Frank Ferst, Captain
Judy Harlan, Red Barron, the. Staton
brothers, Jimmy Brewster, Pinky Hunt,
Jack McDonough, Dummy LeBay, Daddy
Amis, Oscar Davis, Red Murphy, and
Claire Frye, and numerous others, Tech
has no cause for worry over her grid
chances with the teams of the South,
and never were prospects brighter to
outrank her Northern opponents.

The Wildcat spirit has never been
dazed by the elements and:though Coach
Alex turns loose a formidable, gusty
biast, he will be met with that principle
of the jungle, “fear nothing, and no one.”

DAVIDSON ELEVEN DEFEATS

their 20-yard line. Durant punted to
midfield where the ball remained until
the half ended.

On the third play of the third quarter,
Long tore up the whole line on a wild
18-yard dash over center. A little later
he punted over the Palmetto Presbyte-
rian’s goal line. On the next play Hield-
man fumbled, Brice recovering on the
20-yard line. A few moments later
Moore went over for the lone touch-
down,

In the last quarter Long intercepted a
pass on P. C.’s 42-yard line. The Wild-
cats soon had the ball on the 3-yard line
but a pass to Black was wide and was
grounded in the end zone.

DAVIDSON GOLF TEAM LOSES
HARD GAME TO SALISBURY

“Fore!” Ping. Away the little white
ball rides and so the play begins.

Place: Links of the Salisbury Coun-
try Club.

Time: 2:30 p. m', Saturday, Oct. 1st.

Characters: Wearing Davidson col-
ors, Bachman and Charnley, Gracy and
Professor Wood. Wearing Salisbury
colors, Sigmon, Earle, Lloyd, Walker.
Gallery of,one hundred,

The plot is exciting. For the first}.

time the Salisbury Golf Club handed the
lemon to the wearers of the Red and
Black. Playing aggregate score for the
18 hole match, the team of Sigmon and
Earle took care of Professor Wood and
Gracy to the tune of 14 up on the 11th
hole, while Walker and Lloyd were pit-
ting away their match with Charnley
and Bachman 12 up on the 15th.

The match was of a class par excel-
lence with Fresh Bachman for Davidson
easily the individual: star of the day.
Until some unlucky driving on the I2th
got him into trouble, his playing was
little short of sensational. The diminu-
tive golfer seemed possessed of an un-

canny ability to drive for a trye, to ap-

proach in capital form and to putt well.
Although unaccustomed to ‘the sand
greens he showed up well and with more
experience evinces promise of becoming
a real contender for. college honors.
Charnley, a beginner of two months’ ex-
perience, played a strong game, as did
Professor Wood and Gracy.

For Salisbury every man was a star,
Sigmon showing up best. The work of
his team was as regular as clock work
and of the “never give up” variety.

While the score would indicate a walk-
over for Salisbury, the matches on the
whole were unusually hard played and
close. Under the coaching of Dr, Ar-
buckle the D. C. club swingers are work-
ing for a comeback, when _ Salisbury
stages a return match here the latter
part of this month,

Scores of First 9 Holes.

Davidson: Bachman 50, Charnley 57,
Professor Wood 51, Gracy 55.

Salisbury: Sigmon 44, Earle 48, Walk-
er 46, Lloyd 48.

FALL TENNIS TOURNAMENT
NOW HOLDING ATTENTION

The preliminaries of the fall tennis
tournament this week offcially inaugur-
ated what bids fair to be one of the
most successful years in the history of
the sport at Davidson. The object. of
the tournament is to determine, by elimi-
nation among the 31 applicants, the Var-
sity team, from which the college cham-
pion will be selected.

With all last year’s team back, the
prospects are that a team will be turned
out which will lead both Carolina. and
Trinity a merry race for honors in the
state tournament. By a new ruling any
man in the student body will be eligi-
ble to compete for the coveted positions
on the team, Previously the four cham-
pions in the tournament definitely com-
posed the team, but this year, there will
be a fifth man opened to challenge to
the student body and who in turn may
challenge any member on the team.

Finances will not be lacking to pro-
mote the game this year; for the faculty
has set aside $125 for the advancement
of tennis. This money, taken from the
blanket fee, will go for new courts, nets
and. improvements.

“Red” Whitener, an ex-Trinity_man,
and last year’s state champion, is teach-
ing at Cornelius, and it is hoped that he
will give some of his time ceaching the
team.

As the grand culmination of the sea-
son the N. C. State Tennis Association,
of which S. H. Bradley, of Davidson, is
president, expects to run a state tour-
nament probably at Greensboro. Last.
year~Davidson finished third in this
tournament, but this year she can be
looked upon as a strong contender for
the state laurels,

Following is a list of the entrants for
the tournament:

Cunningham vs. Dunlap.

Gretschmar vs. Ives.

Bradford vs. Price.

.Myers vs. Davidson.

Otmond vs. Staley.

EU SENIOR SOCIETY ELECTS
HENRY PATTERSON TREAS.

The Eu Society held its third regular
meeting last Thursday night; Under the
head of general business Henry Patter-
son was elected treasurer ls the society
for this year,

The debate for the evening was on the
subject, “Resolved, that the air service
should supplant the navy in the nation’s
first line of defence,” The affirmative
was upheld by Price, Sharpe, and Miller, |
while the negative was defended by Mc-
Gukin, Roberts, and Weeks. On the
whole the debaters lacked pep. Miller
was the best debater of the evening. His
arguments were clear and to the point,
and his rebuttal was excellent. Neither
side seemed to win a decisive battle, as
the judges were two to one in favor of
the negative, while the house was on
the side of the affirmative.

The best part of the program came
last. A declamation by Walthall made
even the strong men of the house weep.
After this D. L. Mahood in a powerful
oration on “Painless Surgery” froze the
tears in his hearers’ eyes, brought forth
by Walthall’s declamation, and caused
their hair to stand on end, when he told
of seeing a woman cut in twain with
a crosscut saw and then brought back
to life without a drop of blood being
shed or a shriek coming from the pa-
tient. In a second oration E. H. Hough-
ton quelled the. fears of the audience
and brought it back to sane thinking
again on the broad and stupendous sub-
ject “Man.” The philosophy stud prov-
ed that man is not “a beast of passions
and jealousies,” as some have called him,
but is a sane and rational creature, made
in the likeness, by, the power, and for the
glory of the great Architect of the uni-
verse,

PHI FRESHMAN SOCIETY

The Philanthropic Freshman Literary
Society held its weekly meeting last
Monday night at 7:15. The program in-
cluded a debate and a declamation. The
subject for debate was, “Resolved, that
under existing conditions the Uunited
States was justified in making a sep-
arate treaty with Germany. Those up-=
holding the affirmative were H. M.
Wells, T. B. Thompson and J. C. Brown.
Those of the negative were Abernathey,
Carr and Brown.

H, M. Wells opened the fight for the
affirmative and presented a very digni-
fied and impressive argument.

Brown represented the negative as the
first speaker. He attacked vigorously
the character of Germany, showing that
the separate treaty gave Germany too
much power.

T. B. Thompson now took the floor for
the affirmative. His logic was good and
his principles sound.

Mr, Carr followed Mr. Thompson and
delivered a very good talk. He also at-
tacked Germany’s honor, but from a dif-
ferent angle and his line of ClOUEHE was
very interesting.

J. C. Brown was the third speaker on
the affirmative. He argued from the
point of. view of business, showing the
value to the United States of the com-
merce which has again started, due to
the treaty of peace which ended the
state of war and established trade rela-
tions.

John Abernathey was appointed by the
chair to take the negative, as one of
those at first appointed was absent. His

points were well presented and held the
attention of all.

The rebuttals were excellent and the
refutations were snappy and to the
point.

The next thing on the program was a
declamation by Mr. Gracey, on “The
American Patriot,” which everyone ap-
preciated.

Devotional exercises were held by Mr.
Fleming and then the critic made his
report, instructing the new men in the
art of speaking easily and criticizing
their mistakes.

The meeting was then adjourned until
the next regular time, Monday night, Oc-
tober roth, at 7:15,

EU FRESHMAN SOCIETY

The Freshmen of the Eumenean So-
ciety met for the second time this year
on Monday evening to discuss one of the
vital questions of the day: “Resolved,
That under’ the existing conditions today
the United” States Government ° was
justified in signing a separate peace
treaty with Germany. The humor which
the speakers evinced during the rebut-
tal, although of a rather biosterous na-
ture, relieved the monotony of the first
speeches, Messrs. Beers, Hopkins and
Mitchell spoke on the affirmative, and
Messrs. Good and Moomaw upheld the
negative. The third speaker on the nega-
tive was not present. The decision of
the judges was unanimously in favor of
the affirmative. The vote of the house
was practically unanimous jin favor of
the negative. The critic advised that the
subject for debate be studied more thor-
oughly by the Fresh on future programs.
The debate was followed by three good
declamations given by Mess. Regin, Cald-
well and Purdy, Mr. Purdy’s delivery of
“The One Hoss Shay” came as a fitting
ending to the program. By a vote of the
society the date of meeting was changed
to Tuesday night at 7:15. The fines for
unbecoming position were decidedly less
than those imposed during the last meet-
ing.

PHI ORATORS DEBATE ON
NATIONAL DEFENSE ISSUE

Last Thursday night immediately after
the pep meeting in chapel, the Phi So-
ciety held its regular meeting.

After the usual preliminaries, the sub-
ject for debate was announced as “Re-
solved, that under existing conditions
the United States was justified in mak-
ing a separate peace with Germany.”
J. T. Knight and D. P, McGeachy de-
fended the affirmative side of the ques-
tion on the following grounds: That in-
ternational relations would be improved ;
relations between the two great political
parties in America would be improved;
and that the world’s economic situation
would be very much nearer normal. Fol-
lowing lines similar to those of the af-
firmative, the negative opposd this
Proposition, claiming that it would be
disastrous to the world’s ecomonim con-
dition, that our prestige with out for-
mer allies would be destroyed, and that
it would hurt our international rela-
tions generally. The decision was two
to. one for the negative.

L. A, Taylor gave an inspiring oration
on “Who Lifted the Lid Off of Hell?”
He called attention to the extent of
suffering and injustice throughout the
world, and explained that the thinking
college men of the world were the only ~
men who could remedy the situation.

The closing exercises of the evening
was an extemporaneous debate between
Henderson and’ Gibson. Henderson de-
fended the query, “Resolved, that Da-
vidson should establish a standard class
in law.” But the Webster-like delivery
of Gibson won for him the unanimous
decision of the judges.
