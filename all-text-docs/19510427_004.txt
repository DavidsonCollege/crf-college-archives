Evolution of Davidson Freshman

Sees Fear Changed to Confidence

On September 7, 1950, Erastus
arrived at Davidson, North Caro-
lina, to begin his education at Da-
vidson College. Erastus, full of an-
ticipation and fear, duly registered,
paid his fees, and settled down in
14 Duke, spent several hours try-
ing to find his room which he
stupidly presumed to be on the first
floor, when ‘it was actually’ on the
third floor. After getting his room
in fairly good shape, Erastus sat
down on his newly-made bed and
thought to himself:

“I will have to get out all of my
suits and ties first, so 1 can dress
well like the Davidson Gentleman.
I guess I should not have brought
my red pants and purple shirt, too
‘loud.’ I think I had better watch
my language, and... oh... |
better get my Bible out so I will be
sure to study it and learn to be as
good as afl the Davidson upper-
classmen. I wonder if I can get my
books early? I think I will need an
early start if I expect to make a
B-plus average like all the other
students here. I will try not to cut
any classes and I will attend only
one picture show a week—on Sat-
urday nights.”

From the thoughts of Erastus,
any Davidson student can see that
Erastus was, as Woodrow Wilson,
destined to become at least presi
dent of the United States. Just as
a matter, of course, let's look in
on Erastus and see how he is mak-
ing out in his second semester of
college.

As all freshman regulations are
ended and “Hell Week” is over,
Erastus is free to express himself

MANLY McWILLIAMS
NEW BUSINESS MANAGER

Manly McWilliams, past adver-
tising manager for The David-
sonian, was appointed business
manager of the paper for 1951-52
by the Publications Board.

A Charlotte junior, McWilliams
has served three years on The Da-
videonian business staff. Manly is a
business major, a member of Kappa
Alpha Social Fraternity, and an in-
terfraternity sports standout.

ew

as he pleases. Oh, Erastus is enter-
ing 14 Duke now. He uses the
west side entrance to avoid any
trouble finding his room. He is
wearing red pants, a purple shirt,
and a hat with all the colors of
Joseph's coat. He greets his room-
mate in a friendly manner, though
it is not the policy to print the
language he used. He, absent-mind-
edly blows the dust off the Bible
on his dresser, and sits down on
the easy chair he bought, so he
would be comfortable while read-
ing newspapers, comic books, etc.
He is on probation for overcutting
classes, and he did not have a high
enough average to get a formal
initiation into his fraternity. As he
is not very sleepy, he decides to go
to the “flick.” He wonders why
he is not sleepy; he hasnt’ missed
a movie all week. It seems that he
has forgotten that he spends his
time in class by sleeping on the
back row.

Thus Erastus, an ordinary fresh-
man, has become a mature, wide-
awake, and pardon the expression,
a “Davidson Gentleman.”

Fishing And Ballet
Featured By ULFS

The United Literary Film So-
clety’s contribution to the Fine Arts
Festival will be 2 movies, “Man of
Aran” and “Ballet Russe,” which
will be shown next Wednesday
night in Chambers. Auditorium.

“Man of Aran” is a Robert Fla-
herty drama of man against the
elements—in the barren, stormy
Aran Islands, hardy fishermen
snatch their existence from . “the
teeth of the wind and the crest of
the waves,”

From the windswept Aran Is-
lands the program switches to the
Russian stage, from which comes
three outstanding films on Russian
ballét featuring several world fa-
mous artists, among them Marie
Semyonona in Tchaikovsky's “Swan
Lake Ballet.”

CANCER...
(Continued From Page One)

AED President Gene Regen be-
lieves Dr. Williams’ subject is
“timely due to its ever present dan-
ger and in light of the huge
amounts of research completed on
cancer yearly.”

Davidson men, it is thought, by
their position as potential family
heads should be able to instantly
suspect if not detect cancer symp-
toms. {

Regen illustrated the consequen-
ces of failure to know cancer signals
by the pitiful number of people who
come seeking cure, yet have let
cancer get a head start. “There is
little hope then,” he reflected, “even
in immediate operation.”

It was further pointed out by
Regen that though medical science
is on the verge of solving the can-
cer puzzie, quick and accurate diag-
nosis of symptoms on the part
of each individual is yet the most
effective way of insuring timely
treatment. The American Cancer
Society has spent thousands adver-
tising and otherwise publicizing the
warning signs cancer gives. They
are simple enough to guard against
once it has been firmly established
in each individual’s mind exactly
what to look for.
