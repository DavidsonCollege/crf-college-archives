"Bad Mouth’ Stirs

Davidson Grocer

By NORWOOD POLAND
Staff Writer

The town of Davidson was
blasted last Friday by the
worst case of bad mouth
since Lefty lost Charlie Scott.

It seems that Mrs. Coleen
Norket of the Davidson Gro.
cery cut off the credit of one
of her delinquent customers,
and that irate patron. forti-
fied with the néctar of Dio
nysus, visited the establish
ment to register a protest.

Mrs. Norket called the po.
lice to remove Alan Robinson
and his uncle, ‘“‘Doc’’ Thom
as. She said Robinson was
“cussing me out with all
kinds of foui ianguage. ana
in front of those schoo! chil-
dren, too."

John Griffin of the David.
son Police promptly arrived
and put Robinson and Thom
as in his patrol car. When
he went back into the store
to obtain a warrant. how
ever, the two men jumped
out of hte car and ran off in
separate directions. A group

of bystanders did not stop
them.

Thomas ran across Main
Street and hid in the bushes
behind Phi Hall on the col.
lege campus. Officer Griffin
followed him in his car, pull.
ed Thomas out of the bushes,
handcuffed him and forced
him into the patrol car.

Robinson, however, escaped
and is still hiding somewhere
in Davidson's black neighbor.
hood. The police have a war-
rant for his arrest, charging
him with disorderly conduct.
resisting arrest. public
drunkenness, and using pro-
fane language in a_ public
pieve.

Thomas is in jail in Char
lotte, charged with public
drunkenness and resisting ar-
rest. His trial will be held
Jan. 20 in Charlotte.

Mrs. Norkett said she was
reluctant to testify at the
trial ‘because if I told them
the kind of language he used
here they'd throw me out. of
court,”’

Flu Epidemic Slackens

In Mecklenburg County

By BILL LINEAWEAVER
Staff Writer

Christmas vacation appar
ently saved Davidson stu.
dents from exposure to one
of the worst flu seasons ever
seen in Mecklenburg County.

“Flu is still very, very
prevalent in the community,‘
said Dr. James B. Woods Jr..
college physician, ‘‘but there

is not a great deal in the stu
dent body now. The peak in
the town seems. to ‘have been
reached’ between Christmas
and New Year, so the stu-
dents missed the worst part

of the worst two or three:

weeks of flu I have ever
seen.”

According to Lyn Monta
gue, one of the planners,
prose, poetry and nonfiction
will be published and distrib
uted at the college book
store for a price expected to
cover the cost of printing.

“The author would be ex
pected to pay a few pennies
to cover the cost of printing
and. perhaps help. with the
cost of paper, typing and
reading other maunscripts,”
Montague said.

“The job of editing, as now
forseen, will be done with

in mind. There may be some
questions and problems, for
instance, about mimeograph-

Student Wife Deals
With Welfare Needs

By JOHN McLEAN
Staff Writer

“Welfare. for old people is
the crying need of the na
tion."’

That is -how Mrs. Nancy
Hazel, caseworker for Meck-
lenburg County Welfare De-
partment, summed up the
urgency of her work.

Mrs. Hazel. wife of senior
Phil Hazel, has been working
in the. Adult Public Assist.
ance Office for two years.
She first became interested
in welfare work through her
psychology major in college.

Welfare’'s most pressing
problem is a shortage of vol-
unteers on every level, Mrs.
Hazel said. Even nursing
homes are under-staffed, and
as a resuit the patients have
to be tied in chairs when
there are not enough helpers
to keep an eye on them. she
said.

Mrs. Hazel is in charge of
200 clients, who are either
too old to work or unable to
find a job because of phys
ical. disability. Some of these
people have been on welfare
for 10 years. Though welfare
office tries to find jobs for
them, but there are few jobs
open for those with severe
physical disabilities.

Mrs. Ilazel is now working
with the government housing
project in the Double Oaks
section of Charlotte. ‘We've
just been trying to get some
transportation to take these
old people to the Mall. They
almost. never think of even
leaving their neighborhood.”
' Most volunteers go into
welfare programs for chil
dren. She expressed hope
that Davidson fraternities
could be enlisted to drive lo
cal welfare recipients to and
from the grocery stores.

Chairmen Picked

For Commissions

All five of President Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr.'s advisory
commissions have met in or
ganizational meetings and
elected chairmen.

Dean of Students Richard
Cc. Burts Jr. was elected
chairman of the Commission
on Extra-Campus Responsi
bilities in a meeting of that
group held before Christmas.
Professor ‘Jon Fuller was
elected secretary.

According to James Parks.
a member of the commis
sion, the group decided ini
tially to study the problem
of how te get more black
students on the Davidson
campus.

The Commission on Church
Relationship elected Dr. Dan-
jel. O. Rhodes its chairman
and Scott Woodmansee, col
lege chaplain, as its secre
tary. Students William Brown
and Tom Norwood said that
the commission wants to
study the nature of the
church relationship situation
here at Davidson and ex-
plore the possibilties and im
plications of both strength
ening and
relationship.

In a meeting before Christ.
mas, the Commission on In
tercollegiate Athletics decid
ed that its members should
read a collection of back-
ground literature before mak

weakening that -

ing a proposal on the athletic
situation at Davidson, acord
ing to Dr. Locke White. Trus.
tee John Belk was elected
chairman of the commission
and Dr. Anthony S. Abbott
was elected secretary.

Elected chairman of the
Commission on Co education
was Dr. Neil. McGeachy, a
trustee, and Pat Bray was
elected secretary. According
to Joe Murphy, a member of
the. commission, the com
mission is almost unanimous.
ly in favor of coeducation at
Davidson and has divided in
to subcommittees to study
the individual problems in
volved in implementing it
heré.

C. Shaw Smith was elect-
ed chairman of the Commis
sion on Social Patterns with
Peter Hobbie serving as sec-
retary. The commission has
decided to concentrate on
the social situations existent
in the dormitories, fraterni-
ties, and the. unton. accord
ing to Hobbie.

The goal of the commis
sion, said Hobbie. is {o cré

ate a social system which

will afford every Davidson
student equal social oppor
tunities.

All five of the commissions
are planning to meet again
within the next few weeks.

Welfare recipients in Da
vidson are given only $105.50
per month.

Sixty dollars goes for shel:
ter and utilities. $33.50 for
food and clothes. and $10 for

medical expenses. In addi-
tion, they can buy prescrip.
tion medicines for just a dol-
lar, and hospital care is free.

“Increased social security
doesn’t help these people.”
Mrs. Hazel said. As soon as
social security checks go up,
she said. welfare payments
come down by the same
amount.

Mrs. Hazel emphasized the
role of private. charities and
individuals. She said that
North Mecklenburg churches
are more generous with their
financial support than with
their time. Mrs. Hazel hopes
to get church women to vol-
unteer to ‘‘just. come and
talk with these old people
every once in a while.’

She said people are more
willing to talk with children
but are hesitant to spend the
same time with old people.

Flournoy Tours
Czechoslovakia

By PAUL ROWLAND
Staff Writer

Christmas vacation is when
ydu go home to be with your
family. for Santa's visit,
right?

Wrong.

Skiing:in Austria; a visit tp
Czechoslovakia, a glimpse of
the Pope, and New Year's in
Rome was the holiday agen
da for freshman Joe Flour
noy, his seven brothers and
sisters, two sisters.in law and
parents.

It all started last summer
as just another skiing trip.
The large family from Co.
lumbus, Ga., had first tried
it last year in Amsterdam.

Then Soviet Russia invad
ed Czechoslovakia and the
Flournoys expanded their
plans.

“We'd never. been behind
the Iron Curtain before.”
said Flourney. ‘so we just
Cecided to go.”

A Friday zfternoon exam
threatened flight plans be
cause Flournoy's family left
for Germany on Thursday.
The academic powers.that-be
had their hands tied by fac.
ulty regulations but the air-
line's. more flexible schedule
allowed him to get to Europe
quickly. .

“East Germany was ugly.”
Flournoy said of his two days
there, nating that ‘all the im
provements were right next.
to the wall; the further you
get from the Berlin Wall, the
worse it becomes.”

“Sort of a gloom hung
over the city.’ Flournoy
said. recalling his two days
in Prague. “The Czech peo.
ple were really disheart
ened,”’ he said, adding that
“when they found out we
were Americans, they acted
very. friendly.’

_Asked if the Soviet occu
pation. worried his ‘faniily.
Flournoy said. ‘There wasn't
a avar over there -just some
student protests.”

After a short visit vo Vien-
na cand five days of skiing

JOE FLOURNOY
. behind the tron Curtain

at Kitzbuehl, the Flournoys
boarded their train to Flor
ence only to discover they
had the wrong train in a
country whose trains are al-
ways on schedule. Moments
later recuperating from their
near miss a young man intro
duced himself to the Flour
noys as Davidson junior John
Puckett. who is Studying: in
Germany. with the Junior
Year Abroad program.
Fiourney had an unplanned
addition to his New Year's
Eve celebration. When re
turning to his hotel, he was
confronted by picketers who
had been chanting “Ho Chi
Minh” at the American em-
bassy across from the hotel.
‘Flournoy said that police
intervention interrupted his
would be assailants before
anything serious happened.

On New Year's. Flour-
noy was plodding through the
ruins of ancient Rome when
he saw several ‘limousines
and a lot of policemen and
seconds later he caught a
glimpse of Pope Paul.

What ean a family of 12 do
to top off such a Christmas
trip? Their last 12.000 ‘mile
camping trip to Alaska was
hard to follow.

“We plan {o stay ‘home
next. Christmas,” Flournoy
said, but you, get the idea
that if the moon becomes a
tourist spot, the Flournoys
will try.
