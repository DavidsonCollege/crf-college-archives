Spanish department faces squeeze

By JOHN SIMAN
Staff Writer

If the College fails to replace
departing Spanish professor
Bohdan Hlibtschuk, the Span-
ish Department will be forced to
decrease dramatically its course
offerings according to Depart-
ment Chairman Lois Kemp.

Kemp is afraid that just such
a situation may occur next year.

Without a new professor in
Hlibtschuk’s place, the Spanish
Department would include two
professors — the fewest of any
Department at Davidson.
Kemp said that in the event of
there being only two Spanish
professors, it would be impos-
sible to accomodate all the
students who need to fulfill
their foreign language require-
ments in Spanish or to continue
Davidson’s spring term in
Spain program.

An understaffed Department -

would put the Spanish major
itself in danger according to
Kemp. Kemp said that the
major should be dropped if
there is not a third professor,
for “‘the major would be so weak
as to be unworthy of David-
son.”

Kemp said that she has
talked several times this year—
most recently at the beginning
of April — to College President
Samuel Spencer and Academic
Vice-President Price Zimmer-
man about the problems arising
from Hlibtschuk’s coming de-
parture. She described their
reactions as ‘‘sympathetic’’ but
noted that she is still waiting to
hear what action will be taken.

Kemp hopes that the College
will hire a Spanish professor for
at least two terms of next year.
She said that with a temporary
third professor the Department
could maintain current course
offerings. The failure of the
College to hire a: replacement
would be, in her opinion, “‘a
great mistake, especially con-
sidering the role of Latin Amer-
ican (and Spanish-speaking
peoples) in the world.”’

Hlibtschuk was originally
hired to teach for just one
academic year (1976-1977), and
his contract was later renewed
for two more years (1977-1979).
Now that his contract is expir-
ing he said that he intends to
leave teaching altogether.

Though he stated, ‘‘I have
enjoyed my three years. at
Davidson,’’ Hlibtschuk de-
scribed professors throughout
the country as ‘‘overworked and
underpaid.’’ Hlibtschuk said
that he will look for employ-
ment in business or possibly in
government.

Hlibtschuk feels that for
young professors, ‘‘The status
of academia is bleak.’’ He cited
as reasons nationwide economic
problems that have forced uni-
versities to make budget cuts
and a glut of tenured professors
that has limited the opportuni-
ties for younger professors to
receive tenure.

Outdoor classes like this one are part of spring term at Davidson.

University of Georgia students question value of student government

(CPS) — This was a bumper
year for the student govern-
ment at the University of Geor-
gia. The February election
brought out. the second highest
number of voters in UG history,
a situation some thought was
due to the receipt by voters of a
coupon for a five-cent Coke.
Nonetheless, 20 percent of the
21,000 plus student body turn-
ed out, and similarly high
numbers voted in the runoffs.

Last week, 10 percent of the
students, again a large percen-
tage for UG, voted in a referen-
dum to abolish the student
government.

“ironically, it was one of the
best years for student interest
in SG,” ?ecalls Harold Mulher-
in, who won in the last election
on an abolitionist plank.

Thus, UG joined the growing
number of schools dissolving, or
attempting dissolution of their
student government. In the
past year, the University of
Texas— Austin and the Uni-
versity of Northern Colorado
have abolished their govern-
ments, and a half dozen more
have come close. Auburn Uni-
versity in Alabama is currently
considering abolition.

At Georgia, as at the other
schools, the abolition was
prompted by a student percep-
tion of SG powerlessness and
directionlessness. Ex-president
Mulherin, who’s been involved
with the UG government for
three years, charted the decline
of the SGA from the point in

1977 when its allocation powers
were usurped by the student
affairs office. After that, ‘‘SG
didn’t really have a specific pur-

”

However, the government
was still spending $36,000 an-
nually, with “less than a thou-
sand dollars going to student
services. Almost all money

spent on SG is for internal.

sustenance,’’ Mulherin com-
plained. ‘‘Salaries, elections,

letterheads, and self-promotion
were the prime expenditures of
the SG.”

‘‘Out of about 50 motions
passed last year, only’ maybe
three dealt with student ser-
vices,”’ he noted. ‘‘The rest were
about parliamentary procedure,
salaries or the duties of the
officers or something.”’

The dissolution measure won
by a substantial margin — over

1200. voted for abolition, with:
800-some voting against it. For
‘the next step, Mulherin re-
ported that ‘‘already, some
ex-student government people
are making deals with the
administration” to start a new
student government strucutre.
He said that he favors student
unionization as an alternative,'
and anticipates a move in that
direction in the future.

Honor council censures Erwin for role in lampoon

By MARK BARRETT
Assistant News Editor

According to an article in
April 14’s Charlotte Observer,
the Honor Council censured
Charles Erwin, ex-editor of The
Davidsonian, Thursday for a
violation of the Code of Re-
sponsibility.

The Observer article quoted
Dean of Students Will Terry as
saying, ‘‘He was heard by his
peers, and he was censured.
Charles has apologized person-
ally to everyone he had any-
thing to do with. Now I think
we should try to forget it.’’

The censure was a result of
Erwin’s roje in the lampoon
supplement to the April 6 issue
of The Davidsonian. Many stu-
dents and faculty ,
the supplement, entitled ‘‘A
Guide to Courses at Davidson”,
was in bad taste.

The Honor Council’s action
came in the wake of widespread

process.
