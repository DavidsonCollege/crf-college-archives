NUMBER 15

Number of Applicants
Remains High Despite Recession

By Tom Price

Dr. Homer Sutton, interim

Dean of Admissions, says that the

“College has not experienced any
decline in the number of appli-
cants during the current recession.
Although regular decision appli-
cations are not due until the middle
of February, he is expecting the
total number of applications to be
3% to 5% greater than last year’s
record number of 2,258.

Sutton believes parents have
realized the value of a Davidson
education and have been “willing
to make sacrifices” for their chil-

dren.

165 students have already been
accepted as early-decision candi-
dates. Sutton says that this num-
berrepresents approximately 40%
of the class of 1996. The admis-
sions office says the class will
consist of 410 students. The cur-
rent Freshman class consists of ap-
proximately 400 students and
Sutton said that the College will
work to maintain an enrollment of
approximately 1600 students in the
years to come.

When asked if the move to
increase the student body has re-

sulted in any compromise in the
quality of the student body, Sutton
said, “There has been no compro-
mise, absolutely not.”

Dean Sutton stressed that
Davidson is actively pursuing a
diverse student body. He says that
the schoolis attempting to raise the
percentage of black students above
the current level of 4%. Sutton
added that the admissions office is
hoping to work with black alumni
and current black students to help
increase the number of black ap-

Newly Founded Connor House
Receives 64 Freshmen From Self- Selection

By Tom Koonce

This year’s freshmen self-se-
lection of fraternitites and eating
houses also ushered in formal rec-
ognition of anew women’s eating
houseat Davidson. From the origi-
nal committee who met to discuss
the possibility of forming a new
eating house to the forum held to
generate interest in this house, self-

selection finally provided the nec- °

essary numbers that signaled
Connor House was here to stay.
Allison Cotton, co-President
of Connor, said, “Self-selection
went really well. We didn’t know
what to expect and we were pleas-
antly surprised.” The house al-
ready had 65 sophomores and

juniors who had decided to leave
their old eating house in order to
encourage this new house to‘be-
comeestablished. With 64 people,
Connor House reggived the high-
est number of freshmen to join an
eating house. There are also eight
people on the waiting list to join

_this house.

Connor House was named for
Carol Connor Willingham, a 1977
graduate of Davidson and the first

- female trustee to be elected by the

alumni association. This spring
the 129 women will only be social
members at Connor and will con-
tinue to eat in the Commons or at
their former house. Connor is
located in the old Warner Hall

house.

Cotton said that the plan is to
have members eat down at the
house by this fall. For.this semes-
ter members will pay both social
and board duesat their former house
and only social dues at Connor.
They will be able to attend social
events of both their former house
and Connor. Connor House has
already begun to co-sponsor par-
ties and will hold a few of its own
social functions this spring!

Cotton commented that the
charter and by-laws for the house
would be drawn up this week.
Connor is also on the agenda to be

ship service in honor of Martin

Charlotte, and Davidson senior |

Timisha Barnes provided inspira-
tional music:

Arecipient of both a Doctor of

Lawand Master of Divinity degree
from Emory University in Atlanta,
Rev. King works for the Fulton
County Juvenile Court in Atlanta,
and chairs a Student Conference
on Kingian Nonviolence.

She challenged the congrega-

tion to help make her father’s
dreams of nonviolence a reality.
Urging a turn away from “rugged
individualism,” Rev. King main-
tained that today’s society has
suppressed dreamers.

Describing many contcmpo-
rary socialand economic problems
in detail, she said, “when students
stand, anation stands... Our nation
needs our young en massc to help
put our nation back on course.”

When-addressing social prob-
Iems, Rev. King vehemently criti-
cized government’s priority on
military spending, saying, “Weare
waging the wrong war.” Accord-
ing to her, a redistribution of the
defense budget would better solve
social problems related to poverty,
