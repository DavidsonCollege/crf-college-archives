BB&B review “Gays and Dogs”

By BAD BERNARD
and BONEHEAD

Greetings blartfossoms! Boy,
are we really pissed off this
week. Week after week, profes-
sors and students run around
saying how stupid BB&B are
for writing all those hideous
columns that no one ever reads.
Well, we are sick and tired of it;
we decided to go and get some
culture so our column could be
appreciated by all the pointy-
headed intellectuals on this
campus. What did we do? We
went to see one of them plays,
and then we decided to write a

review about it.

The musical we saw was
something called ‘‘Gays and
Dogs,’’ and the student opening
is tonight in case all of you
dumb &t{$§s have forgotten.
The play is set in the streets of
San Francisco near the 69th

Street Kennel. The main char- |

acters are Sly Masterbaitson, a
free dealing transvestite with
big lips; Shake Detroit, a big
boy who gets a piece of the
action; Tearher Gown, an un-
clothed woman; and Idlaid, the
hottest of the Hot Box Girls.

The plot is long and compli-
cated with the main characters
changing roles periodically. The
dogs spring into action at the
end, but we don’t want to ruin
the story by revealing every-
thing that happens and besides,
Bonehead didn’t understand it
anyway.

The gay melodies sung by the
chorus add exponentially to the
atmosphere. Some of the more
popular numbers are ‘‘Do Me”,
“I’ve Never Been in Heat
Before’’, ‘‘Sit Down and Give
Me the Soap’’, and ‘‘Luck with
My Lady Tonight’’. Be sure to
see this production; now get out
of here all you cultured people.

We had a report over the wire
that Harry Griffith delighted
the souls of men, women, and
children at a recent Charlotte
Orioles baseball game. Harry
was innocently sipping suds
(don’t tell Jeff Frank) with
cohorts Moose Gepfert, Bad-
mash Lyle, and Heywhore Sil-
veira when he was picked from

‘Madre scored five runs on the

among the masses to_partici-
pate in a promotional activity
on the diamond. .Harry was
‘chosen for reasons that cannot
be revealed to the public by a
batgirl, named -Lisa,-whorn the
young Davidsonians said pos-
sessed certain. unalienable
rights.

Numerous coins were placed
on a tarp on homeplate and
Harry and three other weirdos
were given sixty seconds to jam
their pockets ‘with nickels,
dimes and quarters. W.H. har-
vested over fifty dollars worth
and returned to’ Davidson that
night to announce his _retire-
ment. Congratulations Harry!

BB &.B. would like to
announce a scientific discovery
we have made in the field of
human sexuality. We have now
obtained conclusive proof that
the male gender is the superior
sex. Bad Bernard originally
theorized that the male is the
more mature and the more
adaptive of the two. The rea-
soning? The male, from an early
age, is confronted with the
dilemma of deciding whether or
not to wear boxer shorts. Be-
cause of the embarrassment of
being caught with wedgies,
tighties or huggers or the equal
agony of mid-day boxer crawl or
the attendant problem of keep-
ing Willard in line, the male is
faced with a constant strug-
gle—boxers or wedgies?

The female gender is never
confronted with such serious
questions at such an early age.
Bonehead has gathered some
empirical data on this subject.
His findings: 73 percent of the
males wear boxers; 27 percent
wear huggers; and only .07
percent of the girls wear boxer
shorts. Apparently, females
have proven themselves the
weaker sex, and have taken the
easy way out—all wearing wed-
gies or huggers. Enough of
that.

In a big game Monday, Su

KA's. It was a tough week for
the KA’s as they dropped a
close-one to the Perpetual
Perpetrators. Slack and the
Four Skins played this after-

noon in a major showdown, but
it was after the paper had gone
to bed. Isn't that stupid—‘‘the
paper had gone to bed."’ That is
newspaper jargon which is used
by only dumb newspaper wri-
ters. Why don’t they just say
something like we had to turn in
the article before the game was
played. But that gets into
philosophical problems like
what came first—the game or
the article; if a newspaper was
printed in a forest, would
anybody read it? But then that
is just esoteric garbage, and all
that ‘really matters is who won
the game, and who got off.

The volleyball season is
drawing to a close, and it will be
a showdown between Bad Ber-
nard and the Lost Colony,
Slaughterhouse Seven, and the
fearless Fighting Sheep of
ATO. This is the first legitimate
contender the Apple Turn Overs
have had in 27 years. We spoke
with team captain Woody Woo-
dall after a recent game: “‘Well,
Bernie, everyone else, the
SAE’s and KA’s and the Delts,
were. recruiting players actively
from as far away as New York
so we decided to get in on a
good thing.’’ We wish the
Zero's good luck in their run for
the V-ball title. Their last
championship was the javelin
catch back in 1952.

In the girls’ league the tour-

nament was played and no one
even knew about it, Said Ster-
ling Martin: “This is the first
year that we have had forfeits in
every game in the tournament.
I guess we should have seen the
handwriting on the wall. It all
boils down to that boxer short
theory of yours.”
