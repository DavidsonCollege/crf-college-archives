Recycling program me

By DAVE KELLER
Executive Editor

Plans to begin an ongoing
paper-recycling program at
Davidson have been halted for
thé moment pending the re-
moval of several obstacles and
the securing of additional
help.

Aimed primarily at recy-
cling the enormous number of
newspaper thrown away
each day on campus, the
program is the brainchild of
senior Steve Holman. Holman
had planned to begin collec-
tion of paper next week before
becoming aware of the multi-
tude of problems which now
confront him.

“Collection is the first prob-
lem,’’ Holman said. ‘‘I had
planned to have containers for
newspapers on each hall,
which would be emptied about
once a week.”’ he was informed
by the Pysical Plant of the fact
that such containers would
have to be emptied every day
to avoid becoming a fire ha-
zard. At this point, there are
enough people involved in the
project to allow such frequent
pick-ups.

Another problem is storage
of collected material. ‘Right
now there is nowhere on
campus that we could store
paper,’’ Holman said. ‘‘We
would have to have some sort
of fireproof container made out
of galvanized metal or the
like.”’

A possible storage is a tin
building behind-an old cotton
mill in town, used now by the
town to store glass for recy-
cling. According to Holman,
Mayor Tom Sadler is checking
the availability of this shed for
use by the College.

Perhaps the biggest prob-
lem facing Holman is finding a
way to get paper to a recycling
company. ‘‘Chesapeake Paper
company in Charlotte will
take the paper, but they'll
only send out a truck if we
have six tons collected,’’ Hol-
man said. ‘‘Mayor Sadler
asked a local man who has a
trailer if he would carry it in,
but he just laughed and said
it was uneconomical.’

Holman said that he felt it
would be pointless to waste
lots of energy carrying the
paper into Charlotte in small
amounts and that the only

feasible way would be to find a
way to store and transport
large loads.

Holman’s project is, at this
point, basically a one-man
crusade. ‘‘N.C. PIRG was
originally interested in the
idea, but now they don’t seem
real enthused,” he said, ‘‘al-
though they have pledged
their support in one way or
another.’’ He emphasized that
a lot of help from individuals is
necessary if the project is to
get off the ground.

‘‘As it stands now, we'll
probably have to have a
volunteer on each hall willing
to take collected papers down-
stairs every day. The papers
could be placed in a central
spot in each dorm where I
could pick them up daily.’’
Another idea he suggested
was for everyone interested in
recycling their waste paper to
keep it in their rooms and to
take it to a central point
periodically. ‘‘I’m operating
from the premise that few
people are going to want to

put a lot of effort into recy-
cling, so there are going to

have to be some people really
willing to help,” he added.

The Town of Davidson cur-
rently recycles glass but is not
involved with paper and alu-
minum. There are collection
bins for galss in the alley
behind Jackson Cleaners; cur-
rently the FIJI’s help with the
crushing of this glass. On
campus, though, glass and
aluminum recycling are not
presently planned.

“The Physical Plant office
says that the collection of
glass and aluminum on halls
poses a health hazard,” says
Holman. ‘‘Also, there isn’t
enough volume of aluminum
to make it worthwhile, and it’s
very hard anymore to distin-
guish between all-aluminum
and steel-aluminum blend
cans.”

Glass recycling could possi-
bly be undertaken in the
future, Holman said. There is
also the possibility of a plant
opening in Charlotte which
will recycle all types of beve-
rage cans.

‘‘There are so many prob-
lems to recycling now,” said
Holman. ‘‘Ideally recycling

After instituting the paper cup
campaign, a few involved students
asked Director of Dining Services,
Ron Scott, to channel the money
saved in the change from plastic to
paper cups. The recipient of this
money will be CROP, a national
organization which is part of Church
World Service.

CROP, which sends most of its aid
to Latin America and Africa, has one
of the lowest overheads in relation to
other charitable organizations and
was begun after World War II as a
community hunger appeal to send
food to war-ravaged Europe.

“Since then it has spread out,” said
Dave Keller, who heads CROP with
Steve Coffey, ‘‘direct relief is only
part of the total budget which donates
seeds, provides technical consultation
and family planning, and sends
blankets and clothing, as well as
emergency disaster relief.”’

CROP at Davidson manifests itself
in a weekly ‘share it with you
neighbor’ meal on Tuesday from
12:30-1:30 in the 900 Room,”’’ con-
tinued Keller. ARA Slater provides
the food for these meals free of charge
and the 75 cent charge to students is

sent to the Carolina CROP office.

CROP also sponsors the Spring
Hunger Symposium featuring a
key-note speaker and a panel discus-
sion or debate which focus upon the
problems of world hunger, according
to Keller. ‘‘We also sponsor ‘fast
days’ throughout the year where
participants give to CROP the money
that they would normally spend for
food.”

Keller added, ‘“‘CROP operates a
limited program in the United States;
and although the main emphasis is on
international relief, it’s just not an

should be a basic part of all
solid waste removal.’ Holman
expressed hopes of convincing
the College to make recycling
more of a part of its disposal
system, “especially consider-
ing the amount of paper
thrown away each day,” Hol-
man said.

“The ideal situation would
be a recycling of all paper and
returnable bottles for all bev-
erages, but right now the
economic barriers are too great
for these conditions to come
about. What we’ve got to do is
simply start thinking in differ-
ent terms.”

Plastic:
The bane

Since World War II, the petrochemical industry has
disgorged 22.4 billion pounds of plastic in the great wave of
highly polluting technology which followed that war.

All modern plastics, like the synthetic fibers of your leisure
suit, are composed of man-made, unnatural polymers. They are
thus wholly foreign to the ecosystem and nondegradable: every
plastic article remains, in 80me form, somewhere on the earth. A
plastic can of course be burned, but this poses a serious air

This huge onslaught of solid waste is dangerously taxing over
one-half of our cities’ waste disposal capacities.

Not only will burned plastic add to the air ordinary products
of combustion, but in some cases will release hydochloric acid,
hydrogen cynide, or phosgene, the latter of which was used in
World War I as a poisonus gas.

As well as being env¥onmentally dangerous, plastic’s
production by the petrochemical] industry uses vast quantities of
energy. The process of producing plastic is very energy-inten-
sive in itself; moreover, plastic itself is a petroleum product.

The result is that the petrochemical industry uses well over
one quarter of all enersy utilized by all the nation’s industries.

Although the plastics industry is very inefficient in its use of
fuel and capital, it is rematkably inefficient in its use of human
labor. Plastics are profitable because labor is held to a minimun;
indeed, the switch from ofganic compounds to plastic has cost
