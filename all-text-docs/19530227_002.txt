Village Approves As College
ys, “That Mud’s Gotta Go”

On behalf of the students living in the Cardboard Village,
the Davidsonian has been asked to extend thanks to Mrs. R. A.
Little, supervisor of the dormitories, and to Mr. D. G. Martin,

- college treasurer, for taking the recent action to improve the
appearance of the grounds in the Village.

It may be of general interest to all students to know that
parking areas and: walks are being installed to eliminate the
muddy conditions in the Village.

A letter from Mr. Martin to the residents stated that’ in
order to make the improvement, cars must be excluded from
the area within the bounds of the buildings. A parking space
is being prepared just west of the village area. A parking space
might require a few extra steps of walking for those who have
cars, the benefit to them as well as to other residents should
be far greater than the inconvenience caused.

Flagstone. walks running along the east side of two of the
buildings and along the north side of another will be installed.
These walks will be connected in ‘such a way that students can
conveniently walk from their rooms to the road, sidewalk, or
parking area without having to walk through the mud.

Although this improvement might seem small in itself, it
points out the college’s policy of overall campus improvement
from time to time where it is needed.

Is Our Chapel Attendance
An Unquestionable Tradition

There have been several instances during this past week
where chapel attendance requirements have been altered at
_ several institutions in this area. We are not necessarily ad-
vocating any change in our present system at this time, but
are merely seeking student and faculty opinion on the’ matter.
“Trustees at Elon College buried a 60-year-old rule de-
manding that. students attend Sunday school and church at
that Christian institution last week. After 60 years of forced
attendance it was discovered that such a ruling violated Christ-
ian principles because it deprives students of their private
judgment and liberty of conscience. ‘

“There exists little danger that a similar move will per-
vade the other venerable religiously-affiliated institutions in
the state. It would appear, however, that if Elon apprehended
these principles of logic after the relatively short period of
60 years, some of the other much older institutions might at

A welcome addition to the year's
concert schedule came on the scene
at the College Union Wednesday
night.

Among the first small recitals for
whieh the Union Ballroom is well
suited, Phi Mu Alpha’s “American
Concert” featured native music oft
heard and eagerly anticipated and
three student pianists not often
ehough heard.

Whether your piano sentiment

Paderewski - Rubenstein schools

As advertised, composers ranged
from Charles Roper (’52) to George
Gershwin, with MacDowell, String
field and Deems Taylor in the mid
dle.

Certainly the most familiar se

\lection was the second and third

movements of Gershwin's “Pre
ludes far Piano.” While not known
so well me as “Rhapsody in
Blue,” “Preludes” contains that
unmistakable Gershwin combina
tion of idyllic lethargy and throb
bing progression that make his

could be right. Forced attendance at religious functions might |
really constitute a disregard of Christian principles.

“But why go against traditions — even if they are
wrong?”’—Gold and Black, Wake Forest.

“University faculty members voted last week to reduce
compulsory chapel attendance requirements to three attend-
ances per week for all students. A notice posted by Dr.
Charles T. Harrison, dean of the College, announced, “A total
attendance of 35 times each semester will be interpreted as
satisfying this requirement.”

“Before the change, University regulations required
gownsmen to attend 39 daily services each semester and un-
dergownsmen, 52. The revision did not alter the Sunday at-
tendance requirements.

banks, crickets, a fishing pole, a
hot sun and a heated passion to
go out and do Something Big, but
not until tomorrow.

Tomorrow comes with the third,
Allegro, movement. And whethor
what one does is big or not so big,
he wouldn't have missed the chance
to try, nor the memories of the
times he has-had doing it. Ration-
alization in four flats.

Just as America is Clayton, Geor-
gia as well as New York; so an
“American Concert” should contain
the simple, surface-emotion music
to complement Gershwin’s subjec-
tive rhythms. Few better examples
of scored simplicity can be found
than Edward MacDowell’s “Wood-
land Sketches.”

A capable artist who made the
well-known difficult stroke to pro-
duce -the simple effect was Owen
Leland. The trilogy included “To a
Wild Rose,” the haunting and re-
miniscent “At an Old Trysting-
place,” and “To a Water Lily.” In
themselves well done, they did
however point up the almost too-
light nature of the program as a
whole.

Any cross-section of musical
Americana would have to include
the grating-metal dissonance that
is. industry’s theme song. Bill

Crymes came closest to this in

DAVIDSONIAN ABROAD:

Deems Taylor’s “Poem,” Opus 5
Like most Stravinsky-Hindemuth
progeny for this layman, it could
have been pastoral, elegiac or a
cacaphonous “Song of the Shirt.”
But more credit, then, to Crymes,
for his technical facility and inter-
pretation.

Although on the same program
with Deems Taylor and Lamar
Stringfield’s “Lost Colony” score, |
Charley Roper’s “Gigue” did credit
to itself and its composer.

Musically, Roper is probably
known best on campus: for his
“Angel In the Mist,” with lyries
by George Walker and debuted by
Elliot Lawrence, Homecoming 1951.
Plus, of course, his refreshing and
easily professional arrangements of
such workhorses as “Blue Moon,”
and “Body and Soul.”

“Gigue” was naturally more ser-
ious, but made the best use of
Roper's chord _ inventiveness
Crymes did a commendable job of
handling the simultaneous ranges
on the eighty eight that Roper is
prone to use.

It was a thoroughly enjoyable
program, and only too short. We
hope that Phi Mu Alpha will make
“An American Concert” an annual
affair.
