Genial Communist Diplomat
Fails To Inspire Students

BY BOB STRAUSER

Anatoli Myshkob, First Sec-
retary of the Russian Embassy
in Washington, appedred on the.
stage of Chambers Auditorium
Monday morning at the invita-
tion of the Student Council. If
anyone was impressed by the
historic nature of Secretary
Myshkob’s presence, the effect
was not séen in the sleepy, un-
inspired faces of his audience.

After 20 minutes of geterali-
ties on “Aspects of Soviet and
American Relationships."’ most
of the audience felt’ compelled
to. attend third period or return
to bed; about 75 found their way
to the Morrison Room to par-
take of free coffee and Com-
munist ideology. The questions
during the informal session
ranged from the Berlin wall
to disarmament. policy;’ Mysh-
kob’s answers. like the much
lamented coffee, seemed a lit-
tle stale.

The wall. according to the
Secretary. was constructed to
halt the flow of saboteurs and
refugees from West Berlin to
East Berlin. In answer to many
smiles, he went on to explain
that. the American press just
did not see fit to cover this as-
pect of the Berlin situation.
With this statement. Myshkob
eliminated all further discus-
sion on the matter by dismiss-
ing as out of hand the iaforma-
tion of his interrogators.

Even Charlile Vick’s lament,
“What is there to sabotage
in East Berlin?” did not sway
the Secretary. Later that af-
ternoon, he would reverse the
situation and state that the
Hungarian revolt was inspired
and led by forces outside of
Hungary—"'l read this in the
American papers.”

Contrary to the general atti-
tude of the Charlotte press, how-
ever, Myshkob was not a sinis-
ter Bolshevik sneering through
his well-oiled mustache.  In-
stead. he was a clean cut, ob-
viously welltrained diplomat
who seemed more prepared for
a discussion than for a lecture.
He seemed pleased with the op-
portunity to present his view-
point but did not display the
missionary zeal of a_ political
idealist.

Myshkob gave the impression
of being a bit unsure of him-
self, turning frequently to the
moderator to check his idiom.
One got the impression, how-

Gift Fund Collects
$1988 For Nevin's

The YMCA Waster Gift Fund,
falling short of its $2300 goal,
netted only $1988 even after ex-
tending the period of contribu-
tion.

Jeff Wampler, Gift Fund
chairman, said those who con-
tributed gave generously with a
few exceptions, but that only a
very small percentage of : the
student body participated in the
drive.

The money will be donated to
the Nevin's Vocational Training
School in Charlotte for the
building and equipping of a new
workshop. The school provides
training in the manual skills
leading to partial and total self-
support for those of very limited
mental capabilities.

apt description of the process
and assured the secretary that
the two terms were synony
mous. A moment later Myshkob
again used the word ‘’sift’’ and
smilingly noted. ‘I. know the
other word has bad connota-
tions.”*

After dinner that night the
Soviet visitor made his final
appearance with a short talk
on Soviet culture. Instead of
speaking on the arts as one
might have expected, he spoke
of industrial and social progress
in strongly nationalistic tones.

Poll Favors Charlotte
For Basketball ‘Home’

BY HARRY CARR

“A reasonable majority”
of the three underclasses
favor playing most of the
home basketball games _ at
the Charlotte Coliseum, ac-
cording to Student Council
President John Spratt.

the juniors. sopho-
mores, and freshmen, 272 favor
the proposal while 195 are
against it, Spratt told professor
Paul Marrotte of the Faculty
Athletic Committee. Spratt quot-
ed the results of a Student Coun-
cil poll requested by Marrotte
for use in scheduling next
year's athletic events.

‘‘Most students, regardless of
how they voted.’’ Spratt con-
tinued, “seemed to favor play-
ing only weekend games in
Charlotte.” However, he reg-
istered his impression that,
**several of the more significant
games of the season could be
scheduled during the week with-
out detering attendance and
without drawing student disap-
proval.”’

In the following question and
answer session, Myshkob was
asked about the Soviet selec-
tion of a third-rate American
film in a recent cultural ex-
change. Al! first, the Secre-
tary tried to dismiss the mat-
‘ter lightly and assured the
audience that “We in Russia
do not think of you as a na-
tion of Boris Karloffs.” Press-
ed further, he noted ‘We
know you have bad aspects
of your culture and we ridi-
cule you for them. We also
know of the good aspects.”

“When I return to my coun-
try and people ask me about
America, I witl téll them about
my trip to Davidson. I will tell
them that there were students
here who were sincerely inter
ested in finding out about our
country, who are gincerely in
terested in furthering the under
standing between our two coun.
tries. This I promise you."

Most students who heard
the Secretary would agree
that the spoken Communist
tine is more interesting, and
possibly more informative,
than wire service reports.
Certainly, most were impress-
ed by his geniality, but few
re-interpreted their world
view as a result.

It was painfully obvious that
the depth of knowledge of for-
eign affairs among Davidson
students leaves something to be
desired. In the area of disarma-
ment.’ most students seemed at
a loss to reply to the Soviet
line. One interrogator, African
expert Walter MacDonald, was
unaware of the fact that Laos
had remained neutralized.

By Monday night Anatoli
Myshkob was gone. Perhaps he
left something more than two
empty Viceroy packs, but it is
doubtful that he planted the
seeds of Communist conspiracy
in the heart of the Presbyterian
community.

With “predominant approval"
of ali, 30 ‘students said they
would make frequent use of
chartered buses to games in
Charlotte. ‘Many more” stated
they would make occasional use
of it, he indicated.

“Very few" favored preferen-
tial seating by classes. Almost
all, though, favored sitting in a
solid block along the side of the
court. Spratt noted a suggestion
to admit students on ID cards
and allow them to select seats
within the section on a first-
come, first-serve basis.

The poll did not state that the
section extended into the Coli-
seum’'s rafters. ‘You can expect
criticism.’ Spratt asserted,
“when students discover they
are on the back rows.”

The student body head recom-
mended a_ student section
stretching across the mezzanine
and not reaching into the bal-
cony. “It would facilitate stud-
ent cheering.” he said, ‘‘and
make up for the loss of choice
seats in Johnston Gymnasium.”

Further, Spratt noted that
students expect some provision

Davidson To Participate

Harold G. McGurdy of the
University of North Carolina
will deliver an address entitled
“The Coming Revolution § in
Thought’ at 8 p.m. Friday,
April 17, in Hodson Hall.

The address by Dr. McGurdy
is open to all interested stud-
ents.

Professor of Psychology and
Research at UNC. McGurdy has
written several books that are
of special interest to the stud-
ent. Combining his talents in
literature and psychology he
wrote The Personality of
Shakespeare.

The Yale Press published his
A Venture in Psychological
Method in 1952. His latest work
is entitled The Personal World:
An Introduction to the Study of
Personality. This book is intend-
ed to be used as an intermed-
iate level text for the college
level or as a general introduc-
tion to the person interested in
psychology.

A volume of his poetry. A
Straw Flute, is also available.
His poem, ‘*Mutiny,"’ won sec-
ond place in the 1951 Poetry
Council of North Carolina com-
petition.

For the Smithsonian Institute
in 1960 he wrote a study on
Childhood Patterns of Genius.
It was his conclusion that pub-
lic schools thwart the develop-
ment of potential genius.

“She understands the student
situation better than anyone in
the administration or faculty.
For the sake of Davidson, I
sure hate to see her leave!" he
added.

Honor Court Chairman How-
ard Arbuckle was even more
surprised. ‘‘Mrs. Moore leav
