‘Y’ Must Attempt The Impossible

In theological terms, the YMCA
is in its eschatological era. It faces
the largest problem of any student
organization next year. Yet in Dave
Robinson, it holds the best hope of
ever realizing anything significant in
our days.

The problem the Y faces is to
communicate with the average stu-
dent. There are numerous religious
organizations for the spiritually in-
clined, but the average student some-
how finds little value in their efforts
on his behalf. They incline to further
persuade those already convinced.

The YMCA can become one of
these. This is the easy way out.

The YMCA can follow its pre-
decessors in building impressive fig-
ures of membership and activities,
and look strong on paper. This is just
bait for freshmen.

Or it can radically re-structure it-
self and provide a program that will
honestly communicate with the stu-
dents of Davidson College. Judging
from the past, and from the apparent
nature of our students, this appears

virtually impossible. The YMCA
should dedicate its efforts toward

proving this not so.

It is easy to see how the Y can
look good and be not good at all. It
can continue the hard-sell, which is
self-defeating.

It can continue the cabinet sys-
tem, which is a modified caste sys-

tem, a constricting structure.
It can keep its programs vague

and unappealing.

But it can, as an alternative. turn
once again to the student as its source
of strength and as its primary field
of emphasis. Specific, enduring pro-
grams offer themselves: the author
series, a truly effective religious em-
phasis.

Above all. an attitude must de-
velop which would result from the
YMCA’s working within and through
its people. It must learn to speak for,
as well as to. the student body. The
YMCA must inherit and work through
our weakness and our strength. It
must not divorce itself from reality by
cloistering in a cabinet.

The YMCA must initiate a true
dialogue between itself and the stu-
dent, not a monologue from itself.
The voluntary chapel program is an
instance in which this dialogue is
being attempted already.

This has been the black night of
the YMCA. The historical and psy-
chological precedents are against its
efforts ever being worthwhile on the
one hand and effective on the other.
Still it can, perhaps, “realize the im-
possible.”

Partial Success
Or Total Failure

As is the way of all changes,
critics are quick to examine minute
discrepancies and point out what an
utter failure the effort was. So it has.
been with Greek Week.

But an examination of the facts
will show how really constructive the
effort was. To be sure, there were
short-comings, but what system does
not have them? The real crux of the
matter lies in the fact that the ma-
jority of the fraternities accepted the
spirit of the change, and while Rome
wasn't built in a day, no one can deny
that improvement was made.

The greater part of the faculty
and student body should be com-
mended in mainfaining perspective
and examining the changes for them-
selves instead of comparing them to
a perfect Greek Week.

A real start has been made this
year; to continue its growth Greek
Week needs level-headed support. not
defeatist attitudes.

The effort will die, however, if
further strides are not made. The
chief complainants this ‘year have
maintained that while a spirit was
present in the fraternities, some of
it was misguided through circumven-
tion of the actual phrase "during
Greek Week.”

This may be understandable in the
light of the strong tradition of these

fraternities, but is inexcusable so far
as responsibility to the IFC and the
rest of the fraternities is concerned.
This difficulty could have been
averted if a more explicit “letter of
the law” had been understood.

The spirit of the law has, for the
most part, been realized. It is for the
1959-60 Interfraternity Council to
clarify the letter of the law, and for
the 1959-60 student body to accept
and approve the new Greek Week.

—R.CS,

Again, We Say ..

The student body will honor Dr.
Martin at a reception in the gym at
6:15 Tuesday night. The occasion is
being given in appreciation of Dr.
Martin’s contribution to the college
in his first year as president.

President Martin's reign has be-
gun as a success. During the brief
time he has been at the helm, the
college community has seen the com-
pletion of the new wing on the li-

brary, the Patterson Fraternity
Court, and the beginning of construc-

tion on the Dana Science Building.
This summer construction will start
on the new dormitory. Also the trust-

ees have already approved the pro-
posed Fine Arts building.

The DAVIDSONIAN feels the stu-
dents are already indebted to Presi-
dent Martin and urges a large atten-
dance at the reception.

We also hope the student body
will be on hand for the inauguration
on Wednesday.

A Heavy Load

The brunt of the weight of West-
ern diplomatic chores will soon fall
on the shoulders of Acting Secretary
Christian Herter who will replace
John Foster Dulles, in the opinion of
most political observers.

This load was carried remarkably
well for the past six years by the
brave Dulles. But now his body has
given way to the ravages of cancer;
we somehow think his spirit never
will. He leaves behind the most com-
plex system of alliances that our na-
tion has ever known. For the past six
years he has been the spokesman for
freedom, the man who matched the
power politics of the Communist
world with an equally powerful voice.

Prime Minister Macmillan’s voice,
despite all his efforts, has been but
a whisper in the vacuum left by the
incapacitation of Dulles. The natural
leader of the Western Alliance is the
United States.

In less than a month the new sec-

‘retary must meet at the pre-Summit

Conference with Allied and Russian
ministers. Because the Summit Con-
ference is, in itself, a victory for the
Soviet, we will go at a  disadvant-

age. The delay in the appointment to
the secretaryship has also detracted

from his ‘prestige in the eyes of Euro-
pean observers. His task is a difficult
one.

But if he can take one virtue. of
his predecessor with him, let it be
courage—the courage to stand fast in
the face of Russian demands and

threats, the courage to lead, instead .

of follow.

THE HAWK’S NEST

- Students Should
A Repeal Drink Ban

By JACK TAYLOR

resent the dispositions of the Faculty.

But opinions, thoughts, and attitudes within a so-

cial community occasionally

With the changes in disposi-
tion will come changes in the
manner of conduct that {is de-
manded by the society. When
this happens, the rules and
regulations of that society must
be revised in order to clearly

; define the new manner of ‘con-

.

duct that is expected.

Regulations that impose «
manner of conduct which is
no longer considered essen-
tial to the society's welfare
must be repealed; regulations
defining the presently expect.
ed manner of conduct must
be adopted.

Failure to do this is to re-
quire prosecution for violations
against a code which, in reality,
is no longer demanded by the
society. Failure to revise the
laws so that they complement
contemporary thought and at-
titude is to invite the destruc-
tion of the code.

When undesirable regulations
are imposed on a society of
changing attitudes as a result
of static laws, it is only natural
that the society revolt against
the code, for the code is no
longer a manifestation of their
attitudes and opinions, but a
manifestation of past ones.

Today. there are indications
that a change is occurring in
the general attitudes of David-
son students. Student enforce-
ment of the “under the influ-
ence” and the gambling regula-
tions during the past three
years was almost non-existent.

In general, the trend seems
to be away from rules which
would dictate morals, for they
are considered to be matters of
individual choice, and toward
rules which insure the rights of
the individual, such as the right
to privacy, aud the sight to pro-
tection’ dgainst dangerous ele-
ments imposed by others.

If 1 have read these trends
correctly, and a change in
student attitudes has  oc-
curred, then the Student Reg-
ulations of the Student Con-
stitution should be revised.
The “under the influence”
and gambling regulations
should be repealed; the regu-
lations concerning personal
rights shouvtd be strength-
ened.

Through revision, the Regu-
lations would more positively
serve the student society by de-
fining a manner of conduct
which would more truly repre-
sent the opinions, thoughts, and
attitudes of the Davidson Stu-
dent Body. If otherwise, a stu-
dent-imposed code of conduct
is of no value.

LETTER TO EDITOR:

Former IFC President Criticizes Greek Week, 1959.

Dear Editor:

It has been somewhat dis-
heartening to read in recent
“DAVIDSONIANS” of the out-
come of Greek Week. In the
vatious comments published on
the matter, there seems to be
an apparent loss of direction
as to what the intention of
such an endeavor was, and al-
so some rather misleading as-
sertions which should be clari-
fied in order to understand its
hoped-for nature.

NO COERCION
In the first place, the state-
ment unanimously adopted by
the IFC last year concerning
Hell Week was not dictated by

To Maintain High IFC Standards

The first and most widely
discussed function of the IFC
this yeor, as in the past, has
been that of sponsoring the
three dance weekends. Tre
Council decided to keep the
cost of the dances on the previ-
ous basis of twenty dollars an-
nually per fraternity member
despite the fact that the 1958-
59 Council had the highest to-
tal expenditures for entertain-
ers of any recent Council.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS
We are exceptionally proud
of the bands and the entertain-
ers we brought to the campus.
We feel that we gave the stu-
dent body the most and the best
for its money.

Rush Week had a new look
this year. The altered system
began earlier in order to avoid
conflict with classes. A new
system of confirmation, hand-
led entirely by the IFC, was
put into effect.

In the field of service pro-
jects, the IFC again sponsored
the annuel Christmas party for

faculty coercion. The ac-
tion was based on sound, ma-
ture reasons for which there
need to be no apology.

Secondly, the statement was
not “vague” with loop-holes”
for individual interpretation. In
what it forbade it was as
explicit as those who drew it
up could make it. It enumerated
those practices which were
henceforth forbidden. It recog-
nized that the practices of Hell
Week were condemned by all
national fraternities on campus
and by the National Interfra-
ternity Conference. It held that
Hell Week practices were in-

Barium Springs’ orphans. In ad-
dition, the IFC again co-spon-
sofed the blood drive with the
ROTC department.

One of the most noticeable
changes effected by the IFC
this year was the introduction
of Greek Week. Constructive
projects replaced many of the
useless practices of the past.
The IFC appreciated the spirit
of co-operation by the larger
part of the student body.

The subject of preferential
bidding was thoroughly investi-
gated this year. After great ef-
forts in presenting and pushing
the idea, the IFC decided to
pigeon-hole the plan.

For the first time in several
years the Davidson IFC was
represented by two delegates at
the National Interfraternity
Conference in Atlanta, Georgia.

TOUGH CHALLENGES

The challenge for the new
IFC will be great:

(1) Greek Week — The new
IFC will be called upon to con-
tinue and to improve the con-
structive basis of this year's

consistent with ideals of broth-
erhood and mature conduct.

ATTEMPT NOT NEW

A third point to be noted is
that this year’s attempt was
not the first to get a working
Greek Week off the ground.
The “DAVIDSONIAN” for the
last decade has been reporting
similar sentiments and results
of pre-initiation activities as ap-
peared this year.

The faculty went on record
some time before 1950 as op-
posed to Hell Week and re-
quested the IFC to make more
constructive arrangements, The
patience of the faculty in this

Groek Week.

(2) Rush Week—Much work
and time will be required to
ensure that the forth-coming
Rush Week functions properly.

(3) NIC—Next year the Na-
tional Interfraternity Confer-
ence meets in New York City.
The Davidson College IFC
should be represented at this
nation-wide meeting.

(4) Constitution—The present
IFC constitution is outdated and
requires thorough revision.

CONTINUED EFFORT

The evaluation of the purpose
and the nature of the fraternity
system should be continued. Al-
so the door is wide open for
energetic leadership in the areca
of campus and community ser-
vice projects. Constructive
action has been urldertaken and
the importance ‘of responsible
fraternity activity has been em-
phasized. A continued and sus-
tained effort will be necessary
if the fraternity system is to be
the credit to the college that
it is capable of being.

students themselves solve the
problems involved has been
consistent with prevailing
policy of letting students man-
age student affairs.

TASK FOR IFC

The task, then, is placed up-
on the IFC to take responsible
initiative in designing a worth-
while Greek Week. It was my
experience last year that intel-
legent student opinion was in
favor of the action of the IFC
and only needed imaginative
leadership to launch upon a
really constructive Greek Week
program.

I suspect that the IFC did

One of the interesting features of current news is the
speculation devoted to the question: Who will be our

Facing the Democrats is an array of choices, none of
which is especially panacean in nature, although the
Democrats have excellent chances in the next election.

Senator Jack Kennedy of Massachusetts is perhaps
the top contender at present, although he has “no Presi-
dential aspirations” right now. Kennedy is young, and
well liked. Perhaps his greatest obstacle—and a serious
one at that—is his religion.

The inevitable question is
raised: can a Roman Catholic
be elected President? Only one
has been nominated, Al Smith,
and he was beaten.

Kennedy's circumstances,
however, have been mitigated
considerably by at least two
factors. One is the noticeable
rise of tolerance over the past
thirty years. The other is a
realization that the “Happy
Warrior's” religion was not
so portentous es many be-
lieved.

From a Southerner’s point of
view, the most comely choice
might well be Lyndon Johnson,
who has made quite a name for
himself nationally as majority
leader of the Senate. He has al-
so made a number of enemics,
however, and he has had a
heart attack, although he now
appears to be well.

Senator Johnson, realizing
that the term “Southerner” is
almost the kiss of death in na-
tional politics, has moved more
and more over in to the West-
ern bloc in Congress. Senator
Johnson is “not running” right
now either.

If the Democratic: Nation-
a! Convention is badly split,
any number’ of things might
happen. Adiai Stevenson still
has a great deal of populari-
ty despite the anathematizing
effect of two defeats. Stuart
Symington of Missouri has
often been mentioned as a
contender, but he is not well
known by the people.

None of these men is overly
liberal, although none is by any
means a conservative. Any one
would probably continue the
strong social welfare program
typical of the Democrats.

Among the _ Republicans,
Richard Nixon is a strong con-
tender. He appears to be the
personal choice of Mr. Eisen-
hower and other party leaders.
He also is popular with the par-
ty rank-and-file. Mr. Nixon has
made a good name for himself
on several occasions. He is a
professional politician. Mr. Nix-
on lacks appeal, however, to
many independents.

The other GOP contender
is of course, Nelson Rocke-
feller. His election as Gov-
ernor of New York in an off-
year for his party has made
him a marked man. Populer
with the independents, and
showing signs .of political
astufeness, he is nevertheless
@ newcomer to the game of
politics.

If the GOP wins, its candi-
date must run 5-6% ahead of
his party’s normal vote. Mr.
Eisenhower has been able to
do this, but few men have
equaled Ike's personel popu-
larity.

resources in planning its Greek
Week. The IFC last year ap-
propriated the $180 of Skit Nite
fines to be used in Greek Week
ventures. At the time ideas
such as the possibility of a
three day program climaxed by
an official of the NIC were sug-
gested.

This is not so much to criti-
cize the IFC, for pioneering
a really successful Greek Week
confronts problems of inexperi-
ence and tradition-inertia, as
the IFC hastened to point out.
This is to say, however, that
the student body at Davidson
is capable of engineering an
imaginative and worthwhile
Greek Week in which not only
the pledges profit, but the en-
thustastic fraternity men have
their enthusiasm constructively
channeled, and the critics have
their criticism’ balanced by a
renewed understanding of what
a successful fraternity system is

worth.
