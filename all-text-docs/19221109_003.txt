A MERRY DRAMA
In Many Acts and Numberless

Scenes
By Ibsen Shaw Milne.
Characters: ‘Mack’ Lennox, a

rather prominent senior; he prides
himself on the nobbiness of his ward-
robe; it is his private opinion that he is
a veritable lady-killer.

“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and a
no less prominent junior; in matter of
dress, his taste is more conservative
and substantial; in regard to his love
affairs the old adage, “Still water runs
deep,” is applicable.

Act the Eighth
THE COMPLETE MAN

Mack—How’s this for a parody on
“Grandma Williams” old dear?

Bill—To tell the truth I have not
heard it as yet.

Mack—Well you won’t suffer under
that disability long, here goes—

“Oh, a woman’s as young as shé feels,”
she replied.

So just try to get that in your noodle;

And I-ain’t had such fun since your

_ grandfather died.

Say, they’re starting the band,
Let’s toddle.

Bill—Huh!

Mack—See that gentleman on the
right.

Bill—Yes,

Mack—Let’s “dress” him. I’ll start
at his head: A Stetson hat, I’ll wager
a dime.

Bill—No takers. But say he ought
to have on one of those new brush felt
light weights Mellon just got in the
other day. Jakey Smith says that
they’re the stuff. I’ll assign his suit to
Hart, Schaffner & Marx.

Mack—Righto you are. Since Hart
and the rest of them made the suit
reckon that_I’ll have to put a Hickey-
Freeman’ label in the overcoat.

Bill—There’s no better. Going back
up, seven to eleven the shirt is a Man-
hattan.

Mack—Ditto on the athletic.

Bill—Can’t see his feet but if they’re
not encased in interwoven ana a good
pair o’ Clapps you can have my job.

Mack—Don’t want it, but say that’s
a line to conjure with.

Bill—It is—and remember you can
judge a store by the company it
keeps. Likewise you, can remember it
when we hit Charlotte Saturday.

Mack—Yea, indeed, thou spakest a
parable.—(adv.)

We have at Hand: a report that
Queens College is going to build a dor-

What’s worrying us is, how high is
the dormitory to be?

Rube Curdts—"Coming back to Da-

Johnnie Smith—"Yes;.T was think-

it would look bad. for Davidson and

The Heights of Laziness

Breaking a cigarette in half so you
will not have to draw the smoke so far.

Prof. in. Keonomics—‘During the
war the high price of cloth caused the
short skirt to become so fashionable.
Now that cloth is so cheap the French
government has brought long skirts
back into fashion in order to use more
cloth.”

Chink Woods on ‘rear seat—‘Let’s
have another war.”

First he took up Latin

Then he took up FRENCH ;

And when the poor boob finished,
They laid him in a trench.

Prof—“If there is any one in this
lecture room who doesn’t like my lec-
tures will he please leave.”

Entire class makes a wild scramble
for the door,

Prof.—‘Here, here, I didn’t say
class excused.”

Hedrick (absent

‘About two weeks.”!

straight at George Hodgin)—“Our

Okey Allison—“Do you know what

Guy Weeks: “No! what is it ?”
Okey—‘“‘Sleep.”’

_Izzy Thames—“What’s the matter
with you Dave?”
Dave Beathea—“I got a frog in my
throat.”
Izzy—“I thought so. You look like
you’re ready to croak.”’

Last Friday on Sprunt Field the Da-
vidson and Salisbury High School
teams fought to a 3-3 tie. The first
quarter opened with Salisbury receiv-

the Wildkitten’s territory, but lost the
ball ona fumble. Davidson recove red,
but was forced to kick.:

but most of them were incomplete. In
this quarter Haynes made some gains
through Davidson's line, but was al-

play, Morton tried for another field
goal, but Arbuckle broke through, in-
tercepted the kick and ran 30 yards
before he was thrown, ‘The game
ended with the ball in the middle of the
field in Davidson's possession,

For the visitors, Haynes and Over-
