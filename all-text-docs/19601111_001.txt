Discussion Of Soph Rush

Fraternity presidents met Tuesday evening in the Kappa oo fraternity |
‘house for an informal discussion with President D. Grier Martin.
the discussion was the faculty’s position on sophomore rush. The meeting was also

attended by IFC president Jerry Cole.

“I don't think the entire fac-
ulty is aware of what really is
happening in the fraternity sys-
tem,” Martin said. ‘However,
there seems to have been en-
ough frustration to lead the fac-
ulty to take action.”

“Had I been able to vote, I
would not have voted for sopho-
more rush. But this is not to
say that I am happy with some
of the conditions that do exist.

I would like to see some major
changes insuring that freshmen
would be allowed to keep up the

November 18 Brings
New Dance Weekend

The appearance of the Kingston Trio and the Four
Freshmen on the weekend of November 18 and 19 will
bring dance weekend activities to Davidson.

The more than four hundred
and fifty girls expected on cam-
pus will be housed in Belk
Dormitory. This is the first
time that a dormitory has been
made available for a function
other than dance weekends.

The weekend activities will
begin on Friday night with the
Kingston Trio concert in Char-
lotte. On Saturday, Wildcat
Day, the football team will
meet the Purple Hurricanes of
Furman.

Rounding out the events of
the weekend will be the Four
Freshman Concert sponsored
by the IFC. This will be held

in Chambers Auditorium from
8:00 to 9:30 p.m.

The Four Freshmen have
been making numerous appear-
ancés in clubs, jazz festivals,
and concert dates since their
organization in Dayton, Ohio,
several years ago, The group’s
great popularity is founded on
their unique presentation of
humor, jazz, and ballads.

The Four Freshmen, Ross and
Don Barbour, Bob Flanigan, and
Ken Errair, have recently com-
pleted the movie, “Rich, Young,
and Pretty.” The group cur
rently has twelve Capitol rec
ord albums on the market.

would prevent physical punish-
ment.”

Martin continued, “I think
for Davidson, with the quality
of men which come here and
the quality of way the fratern-
ity system is setup, that the
quick rush is better over all.”

Martin further pointed out
that there is much disagree-
ment among the faculty con-
cerning sophomore rush. When
asked if he thought there was
a chance of a reversal by the
faculty on their stand he stated
that he was not too optimistic
about this. “Some members of
the faculty who voted against
the proposal last year would
not vote for its rejection now
unless concrete changes were
presented.

THE WEAVERS

Faculty Members State

“Whatever has been done or
demonstrated has not made |
much impact on the faculty.” |

As of now sophomore rush |
will go into effect next fall. It |
will require a reversal of fa-
culty opinion to change or de-
lay this. “I don’t think: that
the faculty intended to hold
anything over the fraternities,

or to use sophomore rush as a
club to get the fraternities to
change. It seems to have come
about in the natural course of
events.”

The concert will be in Cham-

FOLK SONG PROGRAM

The Weavers are Lee Hays,
Ronnie Gilbert, Frank Heller-
man (guitarist-singer) and Erik
Darling (banjoist-singer). Their
program is entitled, “Folk
Songs Around The World” and
includes songs from the United
States, England, Scotland, Is-
rael, Spain, Chile, South Afri-
ca, and many other parts of the
world.

They will present forty songs
during the concert. These in-
clude work songs, blues, bal--
lads, dance songs,
national songs,
war and peace.

any public statements.

Two of those questioned have
been at colleges which operat-
ed under sophomore rushing.
They are Professor Robert
Lord, who came to Davidson
one year ago, and Professor
Thomas Pinkerton, who joined
the faculty this year.

Professor Lord, who has
seen Sophomore Rush at
Dartmouth, said that he feels
Sophomore Rush will not help
remedy any problems in the
fraternity system here. “it
will do only one thing:: The
freshmen will not have to
make up their minds immedi-
ately about joining fraterni-

ties.”

He further stated that per-
haps a position of assistant
dean, who would among other
things handle fraternity mat-
ters, would be a valuable ad-
dition. This man would be a
liason between the faculty and
the IFC. He also favored a
serious study of second semest-
er rushing. '

Professor Lord, added,
“Cole (president of the IFC) im-
plied at last week's faculty
meeting that the IFC is weak
and can’t do anything. If this
is so, then this is a major prob-
lem.”

Watters will be heard in an |
lowing a “coffee break.” He |
will play works by Cleram-|
bault, Daquin, Handel, Bach,
Franck and Marcel Dupre. The |

recital is also free.

He concluded his remarks by
saying that “there is certainly
room for improvement, but it
is generally a good system
here.”’ -

Professor Pinkerton, who
has seen sophomore rush in
operation at Trinity College,
said that the evils of Sopho-
more Rush at Trinity were
just the same as they would
be under freshmen rushing.

He quickly added that he was
not sure any comparison could
be made between Trinity and
Davidson because of the very
different situations.

He said, “I feel that the fra-
ternities are going to have to
do something very constructive
in order to get Sophomore Rush
overruled. Had the representa-
tive of the IFC brought to the
faculty a proposal which would
go into effect regardless of the
faculty’s decision on Sophomore

thing is that it shows that the
students haven't lived up to
their capabilities and responsi-
bilities. The good thing is that
we have an opportunity to ex-
plore a new structure for the
relationship between the stud-
ent and the institution as a
whole.”

Nishihara Speaks
On Japanese Riots

Masa Nishihara, a Japanese
student leader, will speak to an
open meeting of the Interna-
tional Relations Club and the
Y.M.C.A. on “The Truth about

tions” this Monday night at 8
o'clock.

The meeting, which is open
to all students, will be held in

ably.”

Professor William Work-
man said, “Sophomore Rush
is ‘here, but | hope we can
postpone it and eventually
have it taken off the books.
Many students consider it
simply as a threat, but it is an
actuality.”

He said that while he opposes
Sophomore Rush, he is also op-
posed to certain excesses in the
fraternities’ treatment of fresh-
men. If these excesses

he wants Sophomore Rush re
moved from the books.

He added, “Promises won't
do it. I want to see evidence
second semester.”

Professor Charles E. Lloyd
remarked that he didn’t
“think the IFC proposal went
very far.” He said that Soph-
omore Rush shauld not divide
the campus between the stud-
ents and the faculty.

“It seems the best argument
to continue freshman rush is
a humane and mature treatment
of the present class of fresh-
men,” he concluded.

C. Shaw Smith, co-ordinator
of student activities, took a
somewhat different slant on the
rushing question. He said that
the fraternities better than any
other thing can achieve goals
of the college if the students
reflect the aims of the col-
lege. Sophomore Rush is a

Noted Astronomer Named

Dr. Harlow Shapley, professor emeritus of astronomy

in astronomy. Since 1956, when
he left Harvard, Shapley has
spoken at a number of schools
around the country, and has
written two books, The Inner
Metagalaxy, and Of Stars and
Man.

He received his education at
the University of Missouri and
at Princeton. He has taught at
several institutions and has
been awarded many prizes and
honorary degrees.

Johnston said, “We had to

get him. We have done our
best to schedule Dr. Shapley
during a relatively free time

The Reynolds Lectureship
Program, established this year
with income from a $100,000
gift by the Reynolds Founda-
tion, will eventually bring four
to six speakers annually to the
campus. The committee hopes
to procure outstanding speak:
