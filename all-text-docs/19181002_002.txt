In this the first issue of The David-
sonian for the year 1918-19, we, the
Staff, wish to renew our wholehcarted
suport of our Government toward the
winning of the war and should we, who
are in the S. A. T. C., be called out for
more active service, we trust that our
successors will continue this allegiance
with no less loyal support.

_ IN MEMORIAM.

Since last commencement three David-
son boys have made the supreme sacrifice
for Home and Country. “Killed in ac-
tion,” the report read, and Davidson
may well be proud to claim as its. sons
men who were mentioned for distin-
guished service and died bravely at the
Front. The first to fall was First Lieut.
John Cannon Paisley, '17, known to his
college mates as “Jack,” always full of
pep and cheer, a football star, and leader

“in many activities. Lieut. Ervin Shaw,
15, was the second to lose his life, being
reported “missing since July 9.” He
was known as “Molly” while in college,
was somewhat of a mechanic, and not at
all a bad football player. Reports show-
ed him a daring scout of the air, who fell
bravely combating three enemy planes.
Five days later Lieut. Pressly Robinson
Brown, '07, of the Medical Corps, died,
bravely ministering to the wounds of the
soldiers.

As each old boy placed his foot on the
campus this fall, he seemed to sense some
change and strangeness in the very at-
mosphere. Notwithstanding the pretty
good sized parade on the _first night,
things didn’t start off as they usually do
every year. The sceming uncertainty as
to what we should do till the first added
to the unnaturalness of it all, and
coupled with the realization that there
were only twenty of those who would
have been Seniors, back, and the other
two upper classes proportionately small,
it naturally cast a damper on the spirits
of the old men for a while. The excep-
tionally large Freshman class, however,
could not but inspire many live Sophs to
action, and there was much enjoyment
until the commandant startled them into
seriousness by stating that thereafter haz-
ing would be a court-martial offense. It
is needless to say that all new men since
then have beeh treated with the greatest
of care.

At first it seemed as if all the old col-
lege customs and activities would go by
the board, but as the S. A. T. C. grad-

dhe DAVIDSONIAN, October 2, 1918

ually unravelled itself results proved
otherwise. And here is where we Da-
vidson men, who really claim Davidson,
should take a hand, When it becomes evi-
dent just how much time we will have to
ourselves during the day, we should de-
vote at least some of this time.to the sup-
port of the college activities, struggling
to continue. Fellows, we can’t afford to
let the “college” (in that sense of the
word) die out, however much we may be
interested in our military development.
We all naturally have a tendency to
throw up everything else and devote all
our time to the straight S, A. T. C., but
we ought to look beyond ourselves and
realize that we owe a certain amount of
service to the college. There should be
no conflict between the S. A. T. C. and
college, so that we should not feel that
we are lessening our chances for personal
advancement in the first by taking part
in the second.

The best advice that has been handed
out yet with regard to the Spanish in-
fluenza is to keep in good condition, com-
ply with a physician's precautionary
measures and don’t get scared. Any
periodical will tell you all about avoiding
this disease, the first cousin of our old
winter friend, just plain old  grippe.
Keep warm; get plenty of exercise; get
plenty of sunshine; eat,nourishing food ;
keep feet dry; in other words, do just
the things you would do to keep well.
And if you get it, report at once to the
infirmary so you will have a light case
and will give it to no une else. But
there's no use getting rattled over it.
You won't have any better chance to
avoid it by looking suspiciously at every
one you meet and holding your breath as
you pass. If you do all the doctors tell
you and then catch it, well, it’s pot your
fault, and worrying won't help you out.
At the worst there shouldn’t be one man
in five to take it, so cheer up, as there
are four perfectly good men around you
to relieve you of the burden.

TO ALL NEW MEN.

Some evening this next week the presi-
dents of the two Literary Societies will
make a canvass of the barracks to get as
many of the new men as possible to join
the societies, Every new man is request-
ed to think it over carefully, and weigh
in his mind the opportunities which he
may obtain. The societies will not in-
terfere with the military life and should
be of great value to all those looking for-
ward to commissions. Ask the advice of
your officers and professors, and take it.

BEYOND THE MIST.

Troubles come, but we must bear them,
Though the clouds grow thick and
black.
Winter frosts may blight the flowers,
But the spring will give them back.

Sorrow comes where joy was bidden,
We must toil when we would rest;

Yet, the purest gold that glitters
Comes forth from the hottest test.

Oft’ the day is dark and rainy,
When we long to see the sky;

But the soil must have the raindrops
For the summer hot and dry.

B’yond the clouds the sun is shining,
Bright is glows though dark the day;

Through the rifts in radiant splendor,
Soon will fall a cheering ray.

Therefore, cease to pine and grumble.
Pain its recompense will give;
Sorrows here are only shadows
Flitting o'er the life we live.
—Q.N. Huneycutt.

The Davidsonian is indispensable. 1

After the election of officers the society

obstacles arise due to the unusual college
