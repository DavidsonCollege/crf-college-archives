Alumni Associations In
Charlotte And Concord
Have Planned Meetings

Charlotte Alumni Meet Tonight
and Concord Men Will Gather
Tuesday

PRITCHETT TO SPEAK

Director of Physical Education
Will Appear Before Both
Bodies, Preseriting His Plan of
Physical Betterment

Davidson College alumni, residing in
or near Charlotte and Concord, are to
hold local alumni association meetings
in their respective localities. The
Charlotte alumni will meet tonight at
6:30 o’clock at the Chamber of Com-
merce, and the Concord alumni will
gather in that city Tuesday night, Jan-
uary 22nd, at 7:30 o'clock. ‘

The roster of Davidson men in Char-
lotte totals over 265 men, and a group
of enthusiastic alumni in that city were
in personal touch with most of the men
early this week, The alumni office had
previously mailed out a notice of the
meeting, and also sent each individual
a list of all Davidson alumni in Char-
lotte, according to the files in the office
here.

Concord has approximately 50 Da-
vidson men residing in that city. Di-
rectors uf the association have decided
to plan a brief business session, believ-
ing that prevailing conditions in that
city are not favorable to a dinner-
meeting. The central alumni office will

co-operate with this association in a
similar manner to the efforts expended
in getting Charlotte alumni to attend.

Capt. Norton G, Pritchett, director of
physical education at Davidson, will be
the principal speaker at both of these
affairs. Coaches Monk Younger and
Tex Tilson, and. Ernest Milton, alumni
secretary, will also attend from Da-
vidson. It is understood that the Char-
lotte aiumni have arranged for several
brief talks in addition to the address
by Capt. Pritchett, Among them will
be Dr..Hamilon W. McKay, ’06, presi-
den of the General Alumni Associa-
tion.

Officers of the Charlotte organiza-
tion are Judge E. McA. Currie, '16,
vice-president and Geo. E. Miley, ’21,
secretary-treasurer. W. W. Morris,
‘92, heads the Concord alumni as pres-
ident, and T. G. Coltrane, 26, is secre-
tary-treasurer,

DAVIDSON ALUMNUS
DELIVERS SERMON
BEFORE. PRESIDENT

Rev. Thornton Whaling, D.D.,
‘77, Has Honor of Preaching to
United States President

SUBJECT, “HUMILITY”

President Coolidge Attended His-
torical First Presbyterian
Church in Staunton While

on Vacation in Virginia

Rev. Thornton Whaling, D.D., grad-
uate of Davidson in the class of 1877,
recently visited his old home at Staun-
ton, Va., which visit coincided with the
one made to that section by President
Coolidge. The latter attended the First
Presbyterian Church on December
2nd, and it so happened that Dr. Whal-
ing had been asked to fill the pulpit.
A feature account of this service, as
it appeared in the Louisville (Ky.)
Herald-Post, follows:

“President Coolidge had a sermon
on humility preached to him on De-
cember 2nd from the lips of a dis-
tinguished Louisville divine, Rey. Dr.
Thornton Whaling, of the faculty of
the local seminary at First and Broad-
way.

“Dr. Whaling did not prepare the
sermon for the president—and, in fact,
he did not have the most remote idea
that the President would hear it.

“As a matter of fact, if he were con-
sulted, Dr. Whaling would probably
have expressed the conviction that the
chief executive of the American gov-
ernment did not. particularly need a
sermon on humility.

“It happened this way, however.
When Dr. Whaling was called to his
own ‘homey’ atmosphere in Virginia
for the Thanksgiving holidays and was
requested to preach a sermon on Sun-
day, December 2nd, in the old First
Presbyterian Church at Staunton, Va.,
the pastorate held by the father of the
illustrious Woodrow Wilson at .the
time of the birth of the late states-
man-president, Dr. Whaling’s mind
naturally turned to the idea of great-
ness and the things which constitute
true greatness, He therefore chose his
text from Luke IX, the 45th verse,
which reads, ‘Then there arose a rea-
soning among them which of them
should be the greatest.’

“President and Mrs. Coolidge, on a
little holiday visit in Virginia, decided
quite unexpectedly to the general pub-
lic in the small city, to attend the First
Presbyterian Church that particular
Sabbath morning. And so, when Dr.
Whaling walked to the platform his
gaze fell over the congregation and
met the mild eyes of the president,
fixed in reverent attention on the pul-
pit.”

The Louisville article then recounted,
in brief, the remarks of Dr. Whaling.

olina after leaving here. At present
he is connected with A. M. Pullen, ac-

coaches and approximately twenty-
five members of the 1928 football team
of Davidson College at a banquet at

the Armington Hotel in Gastonia on
December 11th. This was the fourth
annual banquet staged by the Gaston
County alumni.

D, R. LaFar, '22, president of the
organization, presided as toastmaster
and handled the affair with facility
and effectiveness. F. L. Jackson, ’06,
treasurer of the college, was a guest
of the association, and he was desig-
nated to introduce Capt. Norton G.

tion at Davidson, who made the prin-
cipal address.

Capt. Pritchett appeared before his
first body of Davidson alumni, and
made a thorough and brief presenta-
tion of the physical condition of the
students at Davidson, disclosing some
startling facts. He outlined the pro-
posed plan of developing the idea at
the college, maintaining that with
proper equipment a remarkable change
could be made in the physical bodies of
each student.

A tirade of commendable comment
was immediately started, brief talks
being made by a number of alumni,
most of whom touched directly upon
the physical education program. Among
those who held the floor for a short
time were S, A. Robinson, W. R. Spar-
row, Rev. T. G. Tate, Coit M. Robin-
son, R, D. Hall, Hugh A. Query, J. Lee
Robinson, F, L. Smyre, Riggs McCon-
nell, and Ernest Milton.

What Constitutes

A Call to the Ministry?

ANSWER NO. 5
The College man who has grown from childhood into
the knowledge of Christ, or the man who through an
arresting experience, has gained such knowledge—
shall he not consider whether the possession of this

knowledge is an element in his call to the ministry?
