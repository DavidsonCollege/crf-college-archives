DR. TOM DAGGY

Dr. Tom Dagey
Is A Tychus Daggy!

By RAN SHAFFNER
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“Yes, there is a Daggy bug,” answered Dr. Tom

Daggy in a quiet, reserved, and somewhat resigned tone.
“It’s a beetle.”

One winter day eleven years
ago, Dr. Daggy packaged his
monthly sample of dead leaf
mold, gathered from Egg Rock
Woods five miles east of David-
son, and sent it to Dr. Orlando
Park of Northwestern Univers-
ity. Interested primarily in the
Psalaphidae family of beetles,
Dr. Park berlesed the sample
and in studying it diseovered a
new species: the Tychus daggyi.

tles that live in rotten wood.
“The most

dee. I started a life history of
those things, but the peculiar
thing is that the larvae found
are of one kind and the adults
of another. Consequently, I
can’t figure out why the com-
mon adult doesn’t have the
‘common larvae.”

Y' will deal with.

interesting beetle
I’ve worked on is the Laucana-

scale.” This is the problem that|

Ervin Duggan, chairman of
the Symposium Area for the
Y, commented, “We became
convinced this year that the
traditional pattern of Winter
Services was no longer a real
challenge to all the students.
| This is a frank effort to in
volve the entire campus—not }

only that part of the student
| body which we usually call
' religious. The questions

we'll be asking the speakers
will be questions which apply
to every one of us.”

Assisting in the symposium
are John. Denton, handling
Union activities; Bob James, in
charge of publicity; Dick Hills,
arranging transportation; and
George Johnson, who will act as
host.

This group recently achieved
fame when NBC's new _ tele-

devoted an entire .hour pro-
gram to the jazz ensemble.

The ensemble has devoted a
great deal of time to studying
the relationship of religion and
jazz. Ed Summerlin, who leads
the group, this past summer

ians across the country.

ber of the jazz band with each
group. At 8:00 p.m. the. jazz en-
semble will give their concert

Tom Colvin, who has organ-
ized this program, states,
“This promises to be a very
worthwhile program. Louis

The lone dissenter in regard
to comprchensives was chemis-!

Ringe Announces
Camp Counselors

Charles Ringe, Freshman
Camp student director, an-
nounced today that the neces-
sary number of students have
been appointed as counselors
for the YMCA-sponsored camp
to be held prior to orientation
next fall.

The following students have
accepted positions as leaders of
the freshman groups: Jerry
Bussell, Charles Cornwell, Er-
vin Duggan, Henry Shue,
George Gabel, Ben Sparks, Bill
Deane, Wesley Weeks, Tom

Uniquely distinguished by
setae on all six legs and one
peculiarly long coiled hair on
each tibia, the daggyi has a yel-
low-orange body, measuring one
and one half millimeters in
length and six-tenths millime-
ters wide. It's vestigial eyes
and tactile hairs indicate sub-
terranean life.

“Vil show you one,” added
Dr. Daggy. And placing num-
ber 31320 of his collection
under the microscope, he con-
tinued, “This is of the coleop-
tera order and helps keep the
soll fertilized. It breaks down
Jeaf mold.”

As I studied the colorful bug,
I asked, “How does ‘it feel to
have a bug named after you?”

Dr. Daggy hesitated,-then an-
swered, “It leaves one without
any particular feeling. Of
course, after that one, I went
out and found some more.
There is no monetary: value in
"them, just trading value. “And,”
he. mused, “it’s interesting to
have an insect named after
you.”

‘for insects any time of the year.

- My attention shifted to the
many bottles in the lab, and Dr.
Daggy explained, “It’s hard
preserving these insects. The
alcohol, evaporates and I lose
them. And the dried insects in
the boxes are attacked by bee-
tles that get.in and eat them up.
The school’s going to build a
set of ‘shelves for me to keep
them in.”

Since his first collection of
butterflies in his youth, Dr.
Daggy has collected innumer-
able orders of insects. In the
past year he has mounted
some two thousand, consist-
ing mainly of flies. “Every
once in a while | start a new
order ¢ don’t know anything
about to increase my know-
ledge in that field. 1 plan to
spend a whole summer on
fruit flies. |

“There's no chance of getting
bored in this profession.” in-
serted Daggy. “You can look

“Those registering first will
be thosc who answer  tele-
phones, who have physical dis-
abilities and whd want to retain
their old rooms.

“After this a rising senior
will come into my office, draw a
number and sign a list indicat-
ing which number he drew.
And that night both he and his
roommate-to-be will sign up for
the room they want in the or-
der in which they drew. Then
the rising juniors and sopho-
mores will likewise register,

OPEN TO ALL

“The program is not solely
for those students who are in
sympathy with the boycott,”
Shue stated, “but it is open to
anyone scriously interested in
the matter.”

Shue expects the panel to
diseuss such topics as the the-
ory behind the beycotts, what
results have been achieved,
what they hope to achieve, if
they think Christian students
should support the boycott,
and is it the best way-by which
to reach their goal.

SUNDAY PROGRAM

This Sunday, the WF is hav-
ing a lunch and discussion at
Erwin Lodge on the subject
“The Challenge of the Christian
Ministry.” Two: former Davidson
students, Sonny Ferguson and
Cortez Cooper, now students at
Columbia Theological Seminary,
will conduct the program.
