Coach McEver announced recently that practice would
be just as tough as ever. The number of players attending
the dances will be very small, probably, since the work in
the practice sessions, will be tough. The addition of
Georgia Tech to the Cat schedule has everyone worrying a

Cage Comment

The basketball players have now played their part as
stage setters. Yes, they were the important OTHER
TEAM that sharpened the eyes of Duke and Carolina on
Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Coaches Cameron and
Long may not have been aware of the fighting Cats when
each of their team’s were opposing our boys, but on the
night of the encounter with their own teams, they had
many anxious moments from our revamped and much
improved quintet. We will all wait with interest to see
the result of that all important first game between the
State and Conference ‘leaders, Duke’ and the boys from
Chapel Hill. for our game with Furman on the same night
has been called off to give the glamour boys on the squad
a chance to get in the swing.

I also hope that some of the school officials that have
long kept tennis in the background at Davidson will see its
future as a sport of war time duration and will provide
more courts, and a few of championship quality to increase
the pleasure of the game for all students.: With no informa-
tion on Wake Forest. Davidson is the only school in the
Big Five that does not have all weather courts for her
team. I wonder what will become of that offer from a
Charlotte agency that will give Davidson all weather
courts cheaper than most schools could get them? AT-
