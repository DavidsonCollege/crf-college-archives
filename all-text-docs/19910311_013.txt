Men's Tennis

Slaughters

by ROBERT GRUBB

The men’s tennis team gained
their first victory of the spring
season last Monday against
Kenyon. The Wildcats started out
slowly, still reeling from opening
the season with six straight losses,
but soon regained their confidence,
going on to win 9-0. Kenyon was
ranked among the top twenty Divi-
sion III team in the country.

“We started out slowly for a
couple of reasons,” said Coach Jeff
Frank. “The team had nearly aweek
off since our last match, and we
haven’t had a win all year, so I
think we hada lack of confidence.”

Albie Varoski, leading the team
at the number one singles slot,
regained some of his confidence
with his first victory of the season.
At number two, David Jespersen
alsocameon very strong. Jespersen
lost the first set in a tie-breaker,
then fell behind in the second set
before rallying to gain a three set
victory. John Beyeralso pulled out
a three set victory for the ‘Cats.
After losing the first set 7;5, Beyer
took control, and dominated the
next twosets, winning them6-0,6-
0.

Inaddition to improved singles
play, the Wildcats brought out a
new doubles lineup’ against
Kenyon. Beyer and Kurtis Zabell
remained in the number one slot,
and they won their match. Dale
Voeks moved up from number

Kenyon

three doubles to number two with
his new partner Russell Briggs.
The pair won their match easily,

and were in control the whole

way, according to Frank. At third
doubles Frank paired his top two
singles players, Varoski and
Jespersen. Playing together for
only the third time, the two
struggled, but gained a straight
set victory. Frank isexcited about
the possibilities of this combina-
tion.

“They will be able to beat a
lotof number three doubles teams

just with the pace they put on the

ball,” said Frank. “Jespersen needs
to improve his volleying and mid-
court play to reach the next level
of play in singles, and playing
doubles will help him get there.”
The Wildcats return to action
today with a match against an-
other nationally ranked Division
III team when they take on Wash-
ington College. Washington’s
lineup includes the top Division
III singles player in the country.
The Wildcats will go up against
Sewance on Thursday. ,
“Sewanee is grudge match for
us because the last time we played,
we lost all three doubles matches
and lost the match 5-4 after lead-
ing 4-2,” said Frank. a
The team opens its Big South
season against Charleston South-
em on Friday, and goes up against
Washington and Lee on Sunday.
