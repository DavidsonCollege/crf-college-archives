WHAT DO you KNOW ABOUT R. Lacy, Jr., pastor of the Central Pres-

byterian Church of Atlanta, Ga,, and one
of the most popular ministers in At-

i) a lanta, has been tendered a call to the

of the Kirst Presbyterian Church of Lexington,
( Va., and has taken the call under ad-
The

visement.

Dr. Lacy returned Saturday from Lex-
use the garden hose or buckets of ington, where he visited, it is said, to
water to prevent his shingle roof from look over the church and its congrega-
burning. How does this affect his _ tion before accepting or rejecting the

; call. Dr. Lacy stated Saturday that he
had come to no decision on the call yet,
and that he was not prepared to an-
!nounce his decision until later on in the
coming week.

A movement has been started by Dr.
Lacy’s friends to induce him to stay at

30 W. 5th St. Charlotte, N.C. the Central Church in Atlanta, of which

he has been pastor for nearly five years.

WILDCAT QUINT SPLITS

(¢ eatin from page 3)
ing the visitors at a two-point lead when
the whistle blew.

The Red and Black squad went in’ the
last half with the real Wildeat fight and the
allround playing of the squad enabled Sapp
and Laird to cage the ball almost alternately.
At one point the home team led 31-22, but:
just as thg game was closing Belmont threw
three field goals, but the game ended 31-28,

The two teams both accounted for 13 field
goals while Davidson got 5 out of 13 foul
shots and Belmont 2 out of a possible 3.

Guilford Game
The Davidson, Wildeat five downed the
Guilford Christians in a keenly contested

each team putting forth its best efforts to
| overcome the leads of the other aggregation. |
The offense of the Presbyterians stiffened
in the last half and the score of 33 to 23
shows the spirited fight put up by Coach
Younger’s youngsters.

From the first blast of the whistle, the
Guilford bunch showed a determination and
vigor that netted them seven tallies before
the Wildcats could rally their somewhat
erratic defense. Coming back strong, the
Davidson quint worked together as a man
and carried the ball up the floor to the bas-
ket. With Sook Boggs playing the part of
stellar guard, the opposing forwards found
every one of their shots crowded, except for
the few that found the basket from the near
center of the floor, J. W. Frazier propelling |
them with a sure arm and perfect aim. One | |
of his long shots from the center of the |
court gained the cheers of the big crowd |
that thronged the gymnasium. |

The first half ended 15-9 in favor of the |
Wildcats. Coming back strong in the final
period, the fighting five of the Presbyterians
developed an attack with a spread formation
connected with lightning-like passes that
found the goal three times in nearly as many
minutes. Both teams tallied one point on |
foul shots, Davidson having 5 chances at
the basket and Guilford 7. Davidson was
going her best when the final whistfe blew,
showing the effect of hard training and co-
operative team work.

Sapp showed up well, preventing many
scores by his guarding and accurate passing.
Hewlett, substituting for Staley, did well as
forward. “Yhe whote“Guitford squad showed
great fight, Thomas as guard, and Frazier
and Cummings showing up well.
