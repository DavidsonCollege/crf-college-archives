THE DAVIDSONIAN

SPORTS

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1991

Vince Lombardi said “Win-
ning isn’teverything; it’sthe only
thing.”

And he was right, winning is
the only thing when it comes to
getting fan support. Everything
I’ve just said goes against the prin-
ciples someone has been trying to
instill in us at Davidson, but I’m
afraid it’s the truth. The good thing
is though, that recently a lot of the
Wildcat teams have been win-
ning, and the fans have been
coming outin biggernumbers than
any other time during my four
yéars here.

I don’t want to seem unsports-
manlike or suggest that fans
shouldn’t support a team just be-
cause they don’t win -- we should
support all our teams. Unfortu-
nately, the average fan isn’t loyal
enough to go out of his way to see
a team he thinks is going to lose.

When I came here as a fresh-
man, my decision to attend
Davidson was partly influenced
by what I had heard on my tour at
Williams. Someone’s mother
asked if the students went to the
football games. The tour guide
replied, “After a hard week at the
library, going down_to the sta-
dium and watching 22 cro-mag-
nons bash their heads together isa

of George Will pretenders sitting
around looking at the poetic side
ofsportssent me here to Davidson.

Much to my dismay, besides
the first half of the first home
gameand the first half of the home-
coming game there was almostno
fan support for the football team.
They weren’t winning. Basket-
ball games drew better crowds,
but not by much. Only about 100
students made the effort to attend
the game with cross-county rival
UNCC. It is possible that the
imminent change of athletic di-
rectors and the absence of South-

ern Conference rivalries made
sporting events less appealing to
most students, but I think it may
have had something more to do
with low numbers in the win col-
umn.

Then, on December 1, 1989
things started to change. I’m talk-
ing about Terry Holland’s return
to town and the opening of the
Baker Sports Complex. Iam going
to mark this as the beginning of the
return of optimism to Davidson
Athletics. Students seemed to en-
joy going to the games at Baker,
even though the team was losing. I
am not trying to give too much
credit to Holland ora building, but
it was a turning point.

The real credit goes to the
coaches andathletes. Through their
extraordinary efforts, they have
made sports fun for the students
again. Dave Fagg’s unflagging
optimism in the face of so much
doubt last year, and the incredible
fan support the football team gotis
testament to my assertion. Win-
ning draws fans. The field hockey
team’s Deep South championship
last year, the soccer team’s na-
tional ranking last year and men’s
tennis coach Jeff Frank’s 17 con-
secutive winning seasons have all
increased interest in Davidson

Fifty die-hard football fans
responded to Pat Millen’s chal-

anyone who went to an away foot-

travelled to Columbia for the soc-

Wednesday.

is, the fans will continue to recog-

The Davidson women’s soc-
cer team opened its season Tues-
day in search of an upset against
Elon, a highly-ranked NAIA pro-
gram. The Fighting Christians
proved to be tough competition,
though, as the Wildcats lost by a4-
O score. Despite intense defense
by sweeper Jenny Satterfield and
the aggressiveness of Ann Todd,
Susan Taylor and Annie Adams in
the midfield, the “Cats could not
stop the Elon attack. Up front, Liz
Clarke, Sarah Cantrell, and Ellen
Sprinkle felt frustrated, as the play
only reached their offensive part
of the field a few times. Elon beat
the ‘Cats with their ability to take

balls out of the air and immedi-
ately put them into play.

Only a day later, the Wildcats
gained their first win of the season,
5-0 against Guilford. The Quakers
were virtually beaten after Ellen
Sprinkle scored off a deflected shot
by Liz Clarke early in the first half,
Soon after, Sarah Cantrell knocked
down the ball, enabling Jenny
Satterfield to score off an Annie
Adams’ corner kick. Late in the
first half, beautiful teamwork down
the middle of the field by Sally
Graham and Ann Todd produced a
goal by Todd and a 3-0 halftime
lead.

In the second half, Sally Gra-
ham passed back the ball for stop-

Stands Tall at 7-3

By Bruce Balestier

The week began with the Pic-
cadeli Volleyball Classic at ASU
in Boone. The ‘Cats there dis-
patched of East Carolina (15-11,
13-15, 15-12, 17-15) and Big South
opponent Winthrop (15-10, 15-7,
15-8) before falling in their final
contest to Appalachian State of the
Southern Conference in 5 hard-
fought games (15-13, 13-15, 16-
14, 12-15, 8-15). Sophomore
middle blocker Katherine Ander-
son was selected to the the All-
Tournament team at ASU.

The Wildcats returned home
to Belk Arena Tuesday evening to
face Catawba, and turned in an
inconsistent performance. They

thoroughly befuddled the Indians
in the opening game, baking them
a 15-0 doughnut, and seemed well
on their way to aconvincing three-
gamesweep. Instead,Catawba took
a 9-2 lead in the second game and
coasted to a 15-9 win over the
suddenly error-prone ‘Cats. Fresh-
man setter Lorie Logan was the
catalyst in Davidson’s 15-5 win in
game three; she gave Holt Hatha-
way abreather with Davidson lead-
ing 6-5, and sparked the team to
nine consecutive points to close
out the game. The Wildcats turned
in arather shoddy effort in the final
game, but managed to polish off
the Indians, 15-12.

In high school, Mac Chapman was
an all-star. And after batting .500 during
his senior season and being named first
team All-State in Maryland, his long-
time aspiration of playing major-league
baseball seemed a very real possibility.
His outstanding freshman season at
Davidson only strengthened his hope.

On October 31 of his sophomore
year at Davidson, however, those dreams
were put on hold, and Chapman had to
think about just walking again. Just after
noon that day, Chapman was driving his
motorcycle from his off-campus room
on Concord Rd. toward campus. when he
was hit head-on by an oncoming car,
blacked out and regained consciousness
80 feet from the site of the collision.

Chapman’s left leg had been totally
mangled; his thigh-bone was broken, as
were his tibia and fibula. Worse yet,
- every bone in his foot was crushed, dis-
located or broken, and part of his ankle
was completely dislodged from his foot.

The surgeons’ first reaction was to
seriously consider amputation. But un-
der the supervision of Dr. Basil Boyd, a

cares for Davidson athletes, Chapman
underwent extensive reconstructive
surgery on his leg and foot.

After the surgery, he had a 14-inch
steel rod driven into his thighbone and
7 pins inserted to hold his foot together.
The doctors told Chapman that while
he probably would walk again, his
chances of playing baseball again were
slim. The doctors told him that there
would be pain and possibly arthritis if
he even tried to play again competi-
tively.

Chapman decided it was a risk
worth taking, and began to undergo
difficult rehabilitation in the hopes of
regaining strength, mobility and flexi-
bility. The painful and the arduous
became the routine for him. Months
later, Chapman is no longer in clinical
rehabilitation,but still maintains a
steady personal training program. He
says of his chances, “I’ve still got a lot
of proving to do.... A lot of people kind
of counted me out.”
