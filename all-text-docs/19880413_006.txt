Inside Art /

After Midterms

I once loved learning—toil and sweat
To search for meaning, hidden yet,

In life and love and good and wrong—
To sing the golden muse’s song,

But in this old gray ward of ours
Can’t even bear to watch for hours
Others at Athena’s call

In carrel, Chambers, dorm or hall.

Damn the ivory slab of it,

I will not work, I’1l only sit.

Past grade or wave, with pen or oar,
Through books I will not wander more.

How can I track the deepest springs through this
Medieval dust

Or snatch a strand of angels’ hair when Bede’s
is set in rust?

No, I will go and find the world—

A welcomed school of thought

For those who understand

That sunlight can’t be bought

With pithy words carved in ballpoint on leaves
of Standard Rule,

Who see that underneath a tree’s the place
for holding school.

But soon, I know, I'll see the light,
Will face poor old Augustine’s plight
And see the error of my ways

And be content to pore for days

O’er volumes of forgotten lore

And thrill at education’s core

(One immortal yawn, no more?)

But with Mild Eyes to meet the chore.
