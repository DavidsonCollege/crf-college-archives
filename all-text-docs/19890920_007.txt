YSSC offers rewards

By PHILLIP PRESCOTT

For the information of new
freshmen and still uninformed
upperclassmen, the YSSC, or
Youth Student Service Corps,
does community service in
Davidson, Charlotte and the
surrounding areas. Many
things one learns while work-

ing with YSSC may actually be

practical in later life. YSSC vol-
unteers participate in activities
such as tutoring a child (you
may have one some day),
learning to build a house (you
could save a lot of money) and
becoming a friend with a sen-
ior citizen (your parents may
soon become one of them!).

The YSSC picnic this past
weekend featured booths for
the various activities the or-
ganization sponsors. Fol-
lowing is a description of these
different programs and infor-
mation about how to get in-
volved.

For those of you trying to
prove that 90 percent of learn-
ing occurs outside the class-
room, the YSSC is a good place
to start. If you are bored with
the passivity of your classes, if
you are tired of talking about
the world’s problems only in
humanities or sociology, then
joinan organization where you
can make a difference. Where
else but the YSSC can you have
new experiences, develop

to volunteering

friendships, and have fun,
with the valid excuse that you
are doing something socially
meaningful?

Davidson welcomes 25 transfer 'Cats

BY JENNIFER SIECK

Twenty-five students on
Davidson campus are experiencing
their first year at Davidson. However,
they are not members of the class of
1993. Who are they? They are the fall

These four students had similar
comments on several topics. They
agreed that Davidson is a refreshing
change, especially for Barnes, Mattison
and Spengler, since they had previ-
ously experienced situations in‘'which

friendly.” Karl marvelled, “Everyone is
so much nicer here. It’s incredible...It’s
a shocker for me.”

Said Spengler, “There’sa pride about
going here...There’s a sense as if we’re

going to Davidson, it elicited a unique
response: “It’ sgota personality besides
an education.”

These four students are excited about
being a partof the learning at Davidson
and working to obtain an education.

1989 transfer students. :

This group is composed of 18 Women
and seven men whose nine home states
range from Conneticut to Florida. Their
hometowns include places as close as
Davidson, Kannapolis and Statesville,
and as far away as Newtown, Connet-
icut and Tampa, Florida. Their previ-
ous college experiences span from at-
tending a small, single-sex college, to
being one of several thousand under-
graduate students at a large, co-ed

Barnes described the academic life, “so
far ...as reading, reading} reading.” All
agree that unlike at their fromer institu-
tions, one cannot get by without doing
the reading.

“There's a lot of work, but it’s good
because everyone else does it too,” said
Mattison. Raymond, Barnes, Spengler
and Mattison appreciate the fact that
students can and do participate ac-
tively in Davidson’s small classes.
Commented Raymond, “The whole

people could be less than friendly.
According ‘to Barnes, “Everyone on
campus is so friendly. I have yet to run

part of something special that’s going
on.”

a diverse group in many ways, they
seem to agree on their feelings about
the Davidson experience so far. “It’s
great!” as Karl Mattison, a sophomore
transfer student, said.

The transfer students come to
Davidson from many different situ-
ations. Rhonda Raymond, a junior
transfer student from Elizabeth City,
North Carolina, attended Peace Col-
lege in Raleigh, a two-year women’s
college which has a student body of
about 500 students.

Timisha Barnes, a sophomore trans-
fer from Kannapolis, North Carolina,
completed her first year of college at
North Carolina Central University in
Durham. She was looking for a’ more
challenging learning experience. “I felt
that I’d get a better education here at
Davidson,” she said.

Mattison and Matt Spengler, also a

. sophomore, expressed their desires to

| be in environments which were more

|. interested in learning. Mattison at-

"tended Lehigh University in Pennsyl-
vania, a school of about 4,500 under-
graduate students. His father attended
Davidson, and his brother is a junior
here. Spengler was enrolled at the Uni-
versity of Connecticut. Its size of 20,000
undergraduate students played a sig--
nificant role in his, Geciaion to change ~
schools. i

At the same time, Davidson students
are people too, and as Matt putit, they
“know how to relax.” The social life
requires some adjustment on the part
of these particular transfers. One dif-
ference at a small school such as
Davidson is that, as Mattison noticed
with amazement, “Everyone knows
each other.”

These transfer students also com-:
mented on the frequent special events
that take place at Davidson, and the
variety of opportunities for involve-
ment, This variety was surprising to
Spengler, since he thought that his ex-
tracurricular activities might be limited
at a smaller school.

Frat parties, however, were not these
transfers’ favorite activities. Some of
the interests they have on campus in-
clude the gospel choir, the Davidson
Ambassadors, the wind ensemble, the
Black Student Coalition and sports
such as golf, sailing, swimming and
jogging.

Spengler was particularly apprecia-
tive tomembers of the transfer commit-
tee--who “went out of their way to°
make it easier for us to adjust.”

The transfer students are still adjust-
