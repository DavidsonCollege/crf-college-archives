Celebrating solidarity:

trying to dispel “voices
of hate and ignorance”

By NARESH NAGELLA
Assistant News Editor

In 1985, the Ku Klux Klan
held a march on Main Street. The
day the march was held, the
Davidson Community decided to
boycott it completely as everyone
stayed in their room, and created a
“lonely march” for those voices of
hate and ignorance. That event was
called “Solidarity Day.”

To remember that strength in
community, the Union organizes a
“Solidarity Week”’ full of serious,
fun, and intellectual events to help
promote ethnic awareness and to
remind Davidson of the “unity” in
community. This year’s theme is
“Celebrating CommUNITY.”

The week started on Saturday,
at one of the. Davidson communi-
ties’ biggest volunteer service
projects ever, the “roof raising”
ceremony for the Habitat House.

. The rest of the week features

nightly Union sponsored events
complemented by “theme” meals
at the Commons.

Monday, the Jumping Java
Coffee House will have a poetry
reading, featuring poets from the
student body, faculty, and commu-
nity at 9 p.m. in the Union Outpost.

Tuesday, Naa Addo, a
Ghanian native, will teach a class
in preparing fine African cuisine at
6 p.m. in the Alumni House. Re-
serve your space by calling the
Union Information Desk.

Wednesday, an important
“Rap on Race” will be held in the
900 room at 7 p.m. Davidson stu-
dents will perform a production
that will address race relations on
campus. Dr. Shannon will lead a
discussion afterwards.

Thursday, a “Community
Servers” panel will be held as out-
standing service volunteers from
the community discuss and answer
questions about their experiences

at 7:30 p.m. in the 900 Room.

Friday, John Singleton’ s s
“Higher Learning,” a film about
racism, sexuality, and dating on a
college campus in the 90s will show
in the 900 Room.

The week will finish with a
“Casino Night Down Under” at 9
p.m. in the 900 room. Here, casino
games from all around the world
will be played as the finale of an-
other Solidarity Week is celebrated.

Sophomore David Jackson
enjoyed Solidarity Week last year
and urges everyone to attend the
events, so that, “a strong sense of
togetherness and shared experience
can be formed within our small but
diverse community.”

Overall, Union Board Vice
President Martin Young says that, «
“the Union is always trying to bring.

- people together, but this week fo-

cuses on solidifying the commu-
nity. It is a time to celebrate being
together.”

dent who is familiar with the
“small-college, liberal-arts” expe-

rience, one different from that of a

“mega-university.”

French Professor ‘Homer

have “demonstrated the potential
to be an excellent fundraiser.”
History Professor Jonathan Berkey

Rosemary Zumwalt jokingly noted
that, “What we’re asking you todo
is find someone like John.”

The faculty present concurred,
and most went on to describe what
particular traits of Dr. John
Kuykendall they would like to see
most in the next president.: ap-
proachability, work ethic, human-
ity, stamina, vision, and past at
Davidson were all mentioned.

After getting as much input as

possible from their campus visit,
Chandler and Young leftto begina
pre-search study. They will orga-
nize an applicant pool, from which
they will select a limited number
of candidates to be reviewed by the
College’s. Presidential..Search
Committee. :

That committee is divided into
three sub-committees: the Trustee
Committee, which will be the au-
thority during the search process, a
Faculty Advisory Committee,
which was formed last week, anda
Student Advisory Committee,
which is still under construction.

The Trustee Committee will

be chaired by Larry Dagenhart,
who is the Board of Trustees’ sec-
retary. Fellow committee members
are trustees Ted Baker, Katherine
Belk, Ed Crutchfield, Laurie Dunn,
Isaiah Tidwell, and Bill Wood.

The.Faculty Advisory-Com-~

mittee will be chaired by Bob
Manning by virtue of his position
as Vice Chairman of the Faculty
pro-tem. Other faculty members

from the Sciences; Sutton from the
Humanities; and Anthropology
professor Nancy Fairley from the
Social Sciences. Mathematics pro-
fessor Bob Klein will serve as the

Though the faculty commit-
tee has no voting power in the
search, this is not unusual. “It’s a

pretty established procedure that
the ultimate decision is the respon-

sibility of the'trustees;” said Dean _
of Students Tom Shandley. He
describes the faculty and student
committees as “fully involved” in

the search, and he credits Dagenhart

as “instrumental” in involving them

in the process.

The Student Advisory Com-
mittee will be formed in the com-
ing weeks. Students who signed up
in the Dean of Students’ office last
week will be interviewed by a four-
student committee of SGA mem-
bers and alumni. The SGA com-
mittee will then nominate a group
of five, which will comprise the
SAC after they are approved by the
Senate.

The entire Presidential Search
Committee is tentatively sched-
uled to meet for the first time Feb-

' ruary 26.

Young and Chandler predict
the search for a new president will

~ last from April until November.

After the Trustee Committee
makes its final selections, the Board
as a whole will vote on who will
serve after Kuykendall leaves in
the Spring of 1997.
