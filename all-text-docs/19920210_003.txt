Grades

Continued from page 1

from students with averages in the
90 to 93 or 94 range, grades that
would have been A’s in the old
system. Hernandez agreed, argu-
ing that a system that hurts the
better students should be reevalu-
ated. Hernandez also disliked the
idea that Davidson should adopt a
grading system that is popular
nationwide.

“T have heard Davidson being
compared continually to other
people. It makes me wonder if we
want change our mascot’s name to
Monkey Bird or something,” he
said.

In making his statement, Long
stopped to reiterate one point: “In
most cases (in all cases, one would
hope), the professor will adjust to
the new system so that there is no
significant difference in the over-
all distribution of his or her grades.”

Most of the arguments against
the new system are based on the
assumption that grades will fall.
The Registrar has provided data to
help determine if grades will in
fact fall because of the system.
However, panelists on both sides
acknowledged that there is simply
not enough data to provide an
accurate indication of the minus
system’ seffecton students’ grades.

Still, the preliminary data pro-

duced by the Registrar indicates ©

that the new system’s effect on
GPA’ sisnegligible. The Davidson
cumulative GPA decreased by less
than .1 of a grade point. Many
argue that such a decrease is too

slim to be significant, and that, ~
after taking other factors into ac- _

count, there is noreal proof that the
minus system was primarily re-
sponsible for the drop.

Burns, however, speculated
that the slight decrease might be
due to the fact that many profes-
sors did not adjust their grading
scale to the new system. For in-
stance, aprofessorcould have given
aB+toastudentthinking of the B+
of the old system (worth 3:5 grade
points). The unlucky student this
semester received 3.0 grade points
for that B+.

Sisler argued that ‘‘no differ-
ence [in grades], howeverslight,”
is. negligible,” and that any de-

crease should be grounds for
reevaluation of the system. She
also argued that there is really no
need for the finer distinctions that
the new system allows, and ex-
pressed concern about lower
GPAs’ effect on students that are
applying to graduate schools. She
reiterated the argument that the
system penalizes “A” students,
maintaining thatasking students at
Davidson to geta93 toearn an “A”
is asking too much.

Finally, John Morris prefaced
his comments by saying that he
believed that the minus system is
here to stay. Given that, he sup-

ported minor adjustments to the .

new system, such as lowering the
numerical value of an A- from 90
to88or89.

Some students have argued that
lower grades due to the minus
system will lessen their chances of
being accepted to law school.
Actually, the new system will
probably have little effect. The

main reason is that a national serv-
ice, the LSDAS, ‘adjusts all the
different grade scales and systems
from different universities around
the country into one scale, and then
sends the changed GPA’s on to
Law Schools.

The Davidsonian also talked
to law school admissions officials
at the University of Georgia,
Chapel Hill, and Virginia. Eliza-
beth Furr, Assistant Dean - of
Admissions at Chapel Hill, indi-
cated that she: never considered

Davidson’s grades inflated in the ©

past. She assured this reporter that
because the admissions committee
takes into account class rank and
the excellent performance of
Davidson graduates in the past, the
minus system will have little effect
on the admission of future
Davidson applicants.

Dr. Marc Galvin, Director of
Student Affairs at the law school at
Georgia, had a similar opinion. He
indicated that Davidson has always
been well thought of, and that the
new grading .system’s effect ‘on
grades would have little effect on
admission of Davidson students to
the law school. The Virginia ad-
missions office would not com-
ment on their process of admis-
sion.

Although the data indicate that
the GPA of the average Davidson
student will not change drastically
by the switch, students on scholar-
ship might well be affected signifi-
cantly. Some students will have to
now make higher grades to main-
tain a certain GPA. That grade
difference can mean the loss of
badly needed money on the part of
students. Matt Bumstead, a mem-

ber of the:audience,‘asked if those *
GPA requirements might be low-

ered, Long answered “‘possibly.”
According to professor Long, prob-
lems of adjdstment to the new
system--should they be confirmed
by further evidence--will probably
come under review at faculty
meetings.

The new system was not hast-
ily considered and implemented.
On January 17,1989, a request
was made by a faculty member for
the Educational Policy Committee

‘(the committee where policy
changes of this kind must origi- -

nate) to consider the minus sys-
tem, and it was later considered
and sent on for the faculty to hear.
Before the faculty voted on the
new policy, a forum was held by

the SGA to discuss the issue (fall —

of the 89-90 academic year). Fi-
nally, on March 7, 1990, the fac-
ulty heard the policy and approved
it by a 40 to 29 vote. The faculty
subsequently decided to wait and
implement the policy in the fall of
the 91-92 academic year.

Despite the arguments that

~ surfaced at the forum last Wednes-

day, the policy will probably not
be reversed. Based on his impres-
sions of the opinion of the faculty

‘as a whole, Professor Long said

there was “not much” of a chance
of the faculty considering a return
to the old system at this time. Dean
Williams also does not foresee a
reconsideration of the new system,
at least not until 4 or 5 years have
passed so that differences can be
studied thoroughly and effectively.

Still, SGA President Cammie
Covington and Registrar Sue Ross

emphasized that students do have -

- APhiA will bring adefinite added

a voice, if not a vote, in decisions
suchas these, and encouraged them
to use it. Long did observe that the
forum itself was “keeping the is-
sue alive” for future discussion
and reevaluation. Two students
have seats on the Educational Pol-
icy Committee, the committee
where any policy change like the
minus grade system must origi-
nate.

nent of a fraternity such as A Phi
A for three years, said that many
students feel that Patterson Court
fails torepresenta lot of the diver-
sity and culture that exists in the
Davidson community, and that
with the creation of this frater-
nity, many holes will be filled.

. “We haven’tdone enough for
the Davidson community. With
many minorities and whites from
‘across the tracks’ inthe college’s
work force and in Davidson and
Cornelius, the college needs to
tie-in to them somehow. A Phi A
will provide that tie-in,” said Mc-
Callister.

McCallister went on to say
that, although Davidson prom-
ises a complete liberal arts educa-
tion, its students often fail to take
advantage of the diversity that
exists on campus. With A Phi A,
he said, Davidson will truly pro-
duce well-rounded individuals.

Dean John Eaves said that
students felt they needed a way to

“associate with family and friends

who have A Phi A or other black
fraternity backgrounds. Notonly,
he said, will A Phi A give its
members a tie-in to the commu-
nity, but it will also give its mem-
bers a nationwide connection
wherever they may: go.

When asked about the effect
A Phi A may have on the enroll-
ment of black students at
Davidson, Eaves said, “This will
have an immediate positive ef-
fect. When students look at a
school they look for something to
identify with. Often students are
less inclined to enroll when that
identification is not immediate.

enticement to these students.”

At the moment, not all of the
prospective members are A frican-
American. A few white students,
as well as one Hispanic student
have showed interest in the frater-
nity.

A Phi A’s creation passed
unanimously when brought up
before the CCRL (Committee on
Campus and Religious Life), and
was also given the go-ahead back-
ing from President Kuykendall.
It expects to be given its official
charter from the national organi-
zation within the next three to
four weeks.

A Phi A will share the BSC’s
house for its functions, but will be
a separate entity from the BSC.
