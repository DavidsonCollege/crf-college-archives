FILM FRIENDS PRESENT

‘Bed And Sofa’ Portrays

Russian Love Triangle

By ROBERT CHUMLEY
Davidsonian Reviewer

For those of us who had pictured post-Revolution Russian art as purely chau-

vinistic such as Shostakovich’s later symphonies and Eisenstein’s epic filming of !

“The Battleship Potemkin,” Wednesday's viewing of Abram Room’s “Bed and
Soft,” a startingly vocal-silent cinema of the '20’s, was a great revelation.

There was no massacre ofValodya refuses to leave, Kyo-

the people of Odessa, no deifi-
cation of Stalin, (on the con-
trary, he is rather lightly re-
garded on a calender from time
to time smiling over the slum
apartment) no dialectic propa-
ganda, and no_ revolutionary
fulfillment. On the contrary, the
film deals with the very real
problem of post-revolution city
life — in particular, Moscow's
housing shortage and its im-
pact on family life.

Nikolai Batalov (Kolya) and
his wife Ludmilla Semyonova
(Lydna) are living in a one
room flat — a humdrum exist-
ence of the normal married
couple after sex and first love
wear off. Lynda bows grudg-
ingly to “his majesty’s” orders
and lament her lack of fulfill.
ment (35) years before ‘The
Feminine Sex'').

Meanwhile a_ third party,
Vladimir, Fogel (Volodya), a
provincial painter and erstwhile
friend of Kyoska, makes _ his
way to Moscow by train — the
lure of Urbs Deus. Upon arriv-
al, he finds that permanent
housing is prerequisite to em-
ployment, and since ‘‘There’s
not a single room in the city”
he naturally ends up at Kyo-
sha’s who receives him warm-
ly. He will sleep on the sofa
while the married couple co-
habits on the bed.

All goes well until suddenly
Kyosha is ordered off to. Rostov
for three weeks to work on a
hew housing project. There be-
gins the affair between Volodya
and Lynda. Upon his return
Kyosha jokingly implies he
suspects the trickery, then ‘re-
veals his joke only to realize
the truth during supper. Since

The 100 Per Cent Bidding Machine . .

sha does, only to return be-
cause of the housing shortage,
and the triangle resumes.
Valodya, the aspiring lover, be-
comes gradually the contented,
commanding husband and, the
role reversed, Lynda looks with
wistful eyes to hubby once
again.

Suddenly Lynda finds herself
pregnant, is ordered to have an
abortion — revolts and leaves
to make her own way. Kyosha
and Valodya remaining together
somewhat. quizically.

So much for the story,
simple menage a trois.

The great achievement of the
film lies. in its subtle technique.

a

and in its social criticism innate |
‘in the choice of scenes.

The
slow pace of the flm, the insig-
nificance of the characters’
lives, their anonymity against
crowded streets and paper cre-
dentials first tend to bore the
viewer until he realizes that jn
effect this is the issue of ‘‘civi-
lization.” Koysha is working on
a reparation of the Bolshoi bal-
let while there is no housing in
Moscow, a slight irony later
remedied by the housing proj-
ect.

The problem of marriage too
goes beyond the simple triangle
setting and indicts the valadity

of the institution itself — all
three characters undergo the at-
raction — contentment — re-

jection process adn move from
intimacy to esirangement.,

Also to be noted is the bril-.

liant photography — the initial
scene of Valedya in the train
window — the tracks all merg-
ing leading to the city — the
fortune breaking sequence and
the crying cat.

The acting was impeccable,
the best indication being that
dialogue never seemed neces-
sary — would have perhaps pro-

THE DAVIDSONIAN

faned the simplicity — the es- 74

trangement from things offered
and utilized by this medium.

The successful effect of the
ilm is largely due to the pro-
fessional improvisation of Sid
Ferrar which accompanied the
showing. His perceptive the-
matic material darting in and
out of a continuous frenetic
movement was perfectly adapt-
ed to the repetitive nature of
the film. One cannot help but
feel Room would have been
more than pleased to have Sid
accompany the film through its
tour of Ukranian movie houses.

“Picnic,” the accomipanying
short is explained ‘in the pros-
pectus as a friple decker con-
flict between dream and real-
ity, artist and the bourgeois, the
individual and society. I must
admit an incompetency to see
this interpretation and without
the inherent wisdom of print
would have been tempted to
lable it a pregnant piece of
trash, impregnated with surreal-
isrh, avantgardism and ismism
of a hypersensitive doit. ] am
stil inclined toward the latter.

The evening was generously
punctuated by sleep turned Da-
vidson students rolling out of
the theater. This, if nothing else,
is an indication of the film's ar-
tistic impact and serves once
again to show the Dayidson
gentleman's unquenchable thirst
for art in life.

The fifth and last flim friends
program of this semester will
be “The Savage Eye,” an Amer-
ican film, on Wed. Jan. 6 at
8:00 p.m. in Hodson Hall.

-LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Fraternal Brotherhood
Satirized By Independent

Dear Editor:

Re: Debate on merits of Dav-
idson’s fraternity system. Let's
face it; even with all that broth-
erhood crap. most Independents
would give up wearing socks to
wear a pin. All that philosophi-
cal talk about the virture of non-
conformity and being your own
man seems pretty irrelevant sit-
ting on a radiator wating to play
ping pong Saturday nights.

Why has the system deterior-
ated even further in past years?
It seems to me mainly because
of admissions policies. In order
to broaden the horizons of typi-
cal Davidson gentlemen, many
students of different interests
and different backgrounds are
being admitted, even Yankees.

Let’s face it. Some of these
new students just aren’t going
to be cool. some won’t have
whole pages in annuals dedi-
cated to them, some will, yes,
some will even wear imitation
Weejuns. The student body has
been rounded out with squares.
But to alter the fraternity sys-
tem by abolishing it or admit-
ting more students to i would
make bad prin in those snappy
publications that are supposed
to snatch in Northreners.

Let's face it. If I were a dues-
paying member of a strong fra-

ternity and proud to pin my
extra-cool girl with my pin, I
wouldn’t want anybody. trip-
sing about the house in Hush
Puppies.

Let’s face it. The only use-
ful thing the recent debate did
was provide lively conversation
for a few students who aren’t
accepted at Hattie’s. just as did
Scriven. Except that my activi-
ties fee didn’t have to pay for
an airplane flight.

So why the big argument?

Kelton

Dear Editor:

Bob Strauser’s article in the
November 20 issue of THE DAV-
IDSON expresses a viewpoint of
mine as follows: ‘Dr. Kelton
stated the only legitimate pur-
pose of fraternities on this cam-
pus would be to foster fellow-
ship and allow students to come
in close contact with other di-
verse personalties.” I did not
claim that this was the only
legitimate purpose, In fact, I
stated that fraternities served to
develop social skills of their
members and that many other

purposes could be named.

I was suggesting. and I still
suggest. that fraternity men
begin to examine the purposes
of fraternities; that they de-
termine which of hese. purposes
are consistent with the purposes
and that they attemtp to deter-
mine which of these purposes
would be interfered with by a
one hundred per cent bidding
system.

I believe that many fratern-
ity functions, such as the two
presented above, are consist-
ent with college purposes and
would not be interfered with by
one hundred per cent bidding. I
suspect that some purposes of
fraternities are inconsistent with
college purposes, and also would
be interfered with by one hun-
dred percent bidding:; so much
the better. I vote one hundred
per cent bidding. There may
also be fraternity functions
which are consistent with col-
lege goals and which will be
interfered with by one hun-
dred per cent bidding. If this
is so, there is reason to ques-
tion one hundred per cent bid-
ding.

Roumania provides a shock.

by oxen (in Poland they had

This year marks the twentieth
anniversary of the liberation of

Roumania from Nazi occupa-:

economic fait to show the Rou-
manian ‘people how far their
country has improved in twen-

much more stunning. A rich

Hopefully you who are’ in-

much from this letter. I am

I thought. you might enjoy hear-

such as food, housing, and girls.

course, first noticed.

als 1917." This is largely the.
extent to which Communism
has stuceeeded - the situation
of poor workingmen, better off
than in the time of Lenin? .

YUGOSLAVIA

Yugoslavia shows another side
of Communism, In this country
the people .are very proud of
their own socialist revolution,
later defiance of Stalin, and the
progress with unpreecdented
speed as new bridges, highways.
factories and schools are being
built with the help of other for-
eign countries. Yugoslavia -is

Wages are low and prices
quite high, the future some:

power in the Kremlin. schools

tinue to leave to work in West-
ern countries: these are all
problems which the Yugoslavian
government has attempted to
solve without direct force. and.
oppression. A flood damaged a
large area in northern Yugo-
slavia this autumn and the
United States immediately sent
financial aid and supplies: the
people remarked that they knew
very well who came to their aid
not their partner in Commu-
nism — Russia— but rather the
United States. ¢

The clean train coaches and
modern station at Trieste, Italy,
the large oil fields outside
Venice, the crowded highways
with new cars. the well dressed
and well fed passengers — all
indicated that just across the
border from Yugoslavia there
was a very rich and progressive
Western country. in contrast
with those Bloc countries of
Eastern Europe.

RELATION TO USSR
The relationship of east Euro-
‘ pean countries to Russia is ex-

ito which such people will be
able to spread successfully their
own oppressive doctrine:

It is only on paper that the
Marxist idcas supported by the
Communist Party have ever
really succeeded. The people of
Communist countries feel that to
be deprived of personal belong-
ings by a. man with-many words
and a big gun (without sugges-
tion from. Radio Free Europe)
for the ‘‘supposed’’ good of some
‘vague ‘‘mass” of unknown. peo-

ple is ‘not a doctrine worth their

support, but rather a yoke to
be thrown off.

These people are actually
for each country, and saturated
with political subtleties which
defy clearing up.

The German mentality being
what it is, East Germany is the
only Soviet satellite in which
honest devoted attempts by the
people at a large exist to spread
and strengthen world Commu-
nism, the people truly believing
in its ultimate victory. The ex-
act relationship with Russia is
fuzzy and will always. remain
a difficult problem for Russia,
largely bécause Russians have:
a tremendous fear and distrust
for Germans. whether they are
Communist or not. :

Poland appears to be divorced
from direct control by Russia
and the Poles seriously believe
this to be.true even today. Po-
land is so poof that she would
be a burden to Russia rather
than help and also the Poles just
will not permit another coun
try to control them. The Poles
would never submit and the

Russians would gain little from -

controlling a dead country.

WEST COULD WIN

The West could crack the
Communist yoke ‘in time by -ap-
plying more economic pressure
on all aspects of trade with the
Communists countries until. a
total.economic blockade existed.
But the results could be more
frigtening if-the millions of peo-
ple. in these countries revolted
and ‘sought out their own forms
of government. With the repeér-
cussions of such a large realign
ment and rebalance of power
in Asia and Europe. the world
would be faced with more ¢om-
plex and dangerous problems
‘than the situation presents +o-
day.

The strength and capability of
Russia. and her Bloc countries
‘are very overrated. Although de-
veloped. -highly in some key
areas. the overall strength of
the Communist countries will
not likely match that of the
West, and-represents in fact. a”
