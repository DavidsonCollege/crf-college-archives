Environmental
Trash Clean-up

By MARCY WHITE

Are you the. kind of person
who feels guilty when you drive
down I-77, wondering what hap-
pens to all the trash on-the side of
the road? Do you envision a group
of imaginary creatures that snap
their fingers and take away all of
the waste?

Actually, these fairies do ex-
ist, but in the forms of human
beings. Thése creatures participate
in North Carolina’s Adopt A High-
way Program, a program that is
based upon organizations or groups
that “adopt” two miles along state
maintained roadway.

These groups pledge to pick
up litter at least four times a year.
According to the North Carolina
Departmentof Transportation “the
program is designed to improve
the quality of North Carolina’s
environment by removing litter and
by increasing public awareness of
the need to dispose of trash respon-
sibly.”

Last year Davidson College
became involved with this project
when Davidson College’s Envi-
ronmental Action. Committee
pledged to support three miles on
I-77- between Sunset. Boulevard
(exit 16) and Reames Road (exit
18).

The group sponsored one

clean-up last spring. Unfortunately;

the turnout was not’as high as
expected. However, the group

removed accumulations of trash
along the roadside that attract lit-
ter.

It also reminded students that
littering does not provide jobs for
sanitation workers; rather, it cre-
ates the need for volunteers toclean
up the environment.

This year, the Environmental
Action Committce is sponsoring
another clean-up on Sunday, Sep-
tember 23 from 12 to 5.

The group will have support
from every fraternity and eating
house-on the court, as every or-
ganization plans to have members
ther for thirty minute shifts.

DEA has also sent flyers to
faculty in hopes that they will
engage in Sunday’s activities.

Transportation will be pro-
vided through the Union. Vans will
be located between the Union and
the biology building.

Participants should follow
these suggestions:

--wear bright clothing that
covers arms and legs

--Stay at least 5 feet from the
pavement edge

--discontinue work in inclem-

~ ent weather

--watch footing

--be alert for snakes, stinging
insects and poisonous plants

At 5:00 pm, there will be free
Domino’s pizza and cokes for all
participants, 4 eyes ine

Interested students should

contact Susan Majors at -6638.

Spanish Club Formed

By ARMANDO
SANCHEZ-ABALLI

The Carolina Inn, home of the
Dean Rusk Program and the Cen-
ter for Special Studies, is now the
meeting site of the newly-formed
Spanish Club.

Rafael Sanchez-Aballi’91 and

brother Armando Sanchez-Abatli-

92, founders of the Club, have
directed their energies toward so-
liciting participation and support
of the club from the student body.

Their efforts have proved suc-

cessful. Officershave beenelected; -

significant numbers of students
have attended the meetings, and
the clubis in the process of becom-
ing chartered with the SGA.

The club’s primary objective
aligns itself with its statement of
purpose: “to create an informal,
non-academic social club for Span-
ish-speakers,”’ ;

The organization is direc
by students, and business is con-
ducted in both Spanish and Eng-
lish. :

Any individual with an inter-
est in the language or culture may
participate.

According to Sanchez-Aballi,

anumber of students had conferred:

with him regarding the possibility
of a Spanish speaking organiza-
tion where members could share
their experiences with the language
and culture.

Some students felt a necd to
follow upon their semesters abroad
in Mexico or Spain, and. they
wanted an opportunity to practice
conversational Spanish in a non-
academic setting.

“Anunprecedented number of .

Spanish-speaking students admit-
ted this year, coupled with the en-
thusiasm of a number of returning
students provided the impetus for
us to establish the club,” said
Sanchez-Aballi.

Two issues currently being ad-
dressed by the club are the charter-
ing of the organization with the
SGA and the staging of a cultural
event during the fall and spring
semesters.

“Becoming chartered insures
us of funds to stage our events. It
also establishes the club as a per-
manent organization of the Col-
lege,” said Sanchez-Aballi. Inter-
ested in sharing its culture with the
college community, the Spanish
Club intends to either produce a
short play or hold a dance.

The Spanish Club meets again »

on Monday, September 24 at the

-Carolina Inn at-8 P.M., and will

hold its mectings on every other
Monday at the same location.
