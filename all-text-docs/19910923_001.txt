Discusses Importance
of Muliticulturalism

By Russ Tisinger

Ishmail Conway, Director of
Student Activities at Cornell Uni-
versity and lecturer, spoke. last
Thursday in the 900 Room about
the importance of embracing mul-
ticulturalism. Conway emphasized
the value of simply understanding
andexperiencing othercultures and
peoples and highlighted the need
to understand other cultures in a
world that is becoming more eco-
nomically and culturally interde-
pendent.

Conway began by noting that
although people generally think of
multiculturalism as a new word, it
is by no means anew concept. It is
a factthat Americans live and have
always lived inaculturally diverse
society. As college students we
experience this multiculturalism
_ everyday. Students bring their own
set of cultural norms to universi-
ties.

Given that situation, the im-
portant issue is to take advantage
of that multiculturalism--to “make
it work” as Conway says. By that
he means we should expose our-
selvesto people with different ideas
and customs. because we come
away from it a little wiser. By
learning about the differences be-
tween certain cultures or people,
you also discover the commonali-
ties between them. Peoplecan only
stand to benefit from such experi-

ences. So, Conway urges, if mul-
ticulturalism is to “work” correctly,
we should not stand in isolation
from our multicultural situation
we live in, but instead immerse
ourselves in it.

At the same time, Conway
stressed to keepaclear idea of who
you are. He madé: the distinction
between the multiculturalist, who
seeks to understand other people
and cultures and tolerates them,
and the assimilist, who tries to
adopt a new style of living that is
not truly consistent with who that
person really is. One should rec-
ognize the differences in people,
respect their beliefs, and look at
interacting with them as an oppor-
tunity to learn.

Conway identified four phases
that people generally move through
in developing a multicultural atti-
tude. The first, and probably the
most comfortable for people, is
isolation. Itis easy for people to go
to a university and isolate them-
selves. in groups, whether they do

so by-color, language, or sexual- _

ity. In isolation people reject situ-
ations of change.

The second phase is inquiry.
By simply talking to people and
asking them questions out of curi-
osity, youlearn useful things about
them. Too many people are too
timid to approach those who are

Student Conduct Council Makes
Changes In Honor Council Policy

By Tom Koonce

_ Inthe 1990-91 Annual Report
of the Student Conduct Council,
some changes to the Code of Re-
sponsibility and the Code of Disci-
plinary Procedure were noted.

Chairman Will H. Terry stated
in the report, “The most notable
change is that only students may
assist the accused inan Honor Code
hearing.” Students may still seek
help from lawyers, faculty, etc. in
preparing their defense, but only
students may take part in the actual

hearing. A student may even have
a lawyer present at the hearing, as
long as the lawyer does not actu-
ally take part. This change was
made because a staff member with
law training took part in a past
hearing.

When word of this new por-
tion of the code reached some
faculty, there was an initial con-
cern about whether faculty could
advise students involved in an
honor council hearing. Dean Terry
clarified this concern, however,

saying that the mandate was meant
merely to exclude faculty from di-
rectly participating directly in the
trial itself. Terry said that the pol-
icy was in no way intended to
hinder faculty advising of sudents
who request help.

The change in the Code of Re-
sponsibility consists of a new sec-
tion which separates actions which
affect persons from that of prop-
erty." The new section will ad the
Honor Council in the handling of
acquaintence rape cases.

Cornelius Traffic Problems May
Eventually Be Solved By Town

_ By: Tom Koonce

Asaresultofcontinued growth
around the Lake Norman area, traf-
fic problems have increased in
Cornelius along Highway 73. At
various times during the day, traf-
fic is often backed up considerably
at the stoplightin front of the Food
Lion shopping center.

Since Highway 73 has only
two lanes and a short turning lane,
it has become overrun by this in-
creased traffic amount. Highway
73 is a state owned road and was
identified a number of years ago
for widening.

Cornelius Town Planner Rich-
ard Jennings said that definite plans
were made to widen this road two
years ago. He said, “The problem

is that there is limited (state) money
available for this project.” |
Jennings said that the state has
only alittle less than half a million
dollars set aside to acquire theright-
away for widening Highway 73.
The plans call for the road to be
widened from the overpass to at
least Nantz Road. Jennings said
that it would cast a lot more than
half a million dollars to acquire the
right-away for this distance.\
Jennings is the first Town Plan-
nerthatCornelius has ever had. He
said that he is having to go back
and fix a lot of problems that re-
sulted from Cornelius not having a
separate Town Planner before him.
The plans are therefore in the
works for solving the growing

Cornelius traffic problem in the
congested area around the stop-
light in front of Bacon and Eggs.
Jennings believed that the widen-
ing would come soon but he said,
“Ultimately, the decisions are left
up to the state.”

.There. is not:a, whole lot more
development planned for this area
of Cornelius in the next few years.
Jennings said, “The town went
through a stagnant phase because
of the recession.”

Developments that are in the
works include a residential com-
munity beside Knox Road and
Highway 73 and an apartment-

the field inside the court.
A mysterious slip-n-

far side of the court, but
nooneseemed interested
in getting wet due to the
crisp temperatures of the
afternoon.
