DEFICIT CONSIDERED

Alumni Quarterly Approved by
Council— Will Appear March 1

Important changes in the policy and
program of the alumni office were ef-
fected at a meeting of the Alumni Coun-
cil last Friday evening, attended by five
of the six members of that body. As a
result of the action taken by the Council
at its meeting Friday, the finances of the
alumni office will henceforth be handled
on a_ strictly business basis, free from
much of the sentment that has heretofore
prevailed in the raising of alumni funds.

Following a report by Ernest Milton,
alumni secretary, which showed that a
deficit of more than four hundred dollars
existed in the alumni fund, and that only
192 of the 3,500 alumni had responded
to repeated pleas for financial assistance,
the alumni council went into an exhaus-
tive discussion of methods for perfecting
the fiscal policy of the alumni offic>. Va-
rious plans were suggested, none of which
met with the approval of the council as
a whole, until the plan of sending regular
statements to each of the alumuai was pre-
posed.

The plan, which is in vogue at Georgia
Tech, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and
numerous other southern and eastern col-
leges and universities, recognizes the ob-
ligation of each alumnus to support the
association to the extent of the dués as-
sessed by the Council. Consequently a
bill for annual dues will be mailed to each
alumnus who has failed to previously con-
tribute, and subsequent notices will” be
provided for delinquent accounts.

This method will obviate the necessity
of appointing class agents and association
treasurers. It will result in an efficient
system of accounting, and each -alumnus
will be called upon to make his contribu-
tions to the support of the association in
a strictly business-like manner,

Under authorization of the Council, the
alumni affice will continue to operate on
the basis of the budget agreed to at the
close of last year, and will not cut short

limit permitted under the budget. It is
believed that under the new method of
securing funds, the deficit now existing in
the funds of the alumni office will be en-
tirely eliminated.

In addition to the discussion of financial
matters, the Alumni Council on motion cf
Mr. J. A. Scott, vice-president, tetatively
approved the proposal of an Alumni
Quarterly, to be published four times dur-
ing the year. Mr. Scott’s motion pro-
vided, however, that no effort should be
made to publish the magazine unless and
until a definite plan had been approved
by a representative of the Council where-
by no further financial burden would be
incurred by the association. It was point-
ed out by proponents of the Quarterly
that it could in all probability be publish-
ed without cost to the association, the
income from advertising to provide the
necessary funds. Thé first issue of the
magazine will appear on or about March
1, provided the provisions of the Council’s
agrement are complied with.
