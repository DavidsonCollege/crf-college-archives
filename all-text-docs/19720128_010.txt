According to Mades, Spencer
reevivesd tie petition and said
he would reter it to his vice
presidents, John M. Bevan and
{*. David Cornell, for their con
sideralion. Cornell and Bevan
are to make the ultimate de
cision on the implementation of
the comprehensive fee.

As was expected by Eades,
Spencer neither took nor pro
mised any specific action on the
petition other than referring it
to Bevan and Cornell.

Eades expressed satisfaction
with the success of his petition,
einphasizing the point that only
tive of the 135 students who he
personally approached refused
to sign it.

The resolution passed by the
Patterson Court Council, which
is composed of the club presi-
dents and treasurers, came in
a regular Tuesday meeting with
Dean Will Terry.

Although the presidents con-
ceded that the fee would make
huokkeeping easier for the eat-
ing clubs, they opposed the fee
overall because they feel that
it would hurt many students who
are not how eating on Patter-
son Court.

The final vote of the group
was 6-2.

Meeting in small groups of
cight to fifteen people once ia
week for eight: weeks. “Great
Decisions” participants discuss
one critical foreign policy issue
each week. Background material
for the discussion is provided
by concise objective readings
in at booklet provided by the
Foreign Policy Association and
by weekly half-hour programms
on Sunday afternoon at 3:30 on
the cducational television net-
work (Channel 58). The $3.00
chai ge tor the background book-
let is the only expense involved.

‘Compromised’ Library Plan
Varied Reactions

Produces

By DAVID ARANT
Staff Writer

With the announcement of the
trustee’s final approval of the
facade for the E. H. Little Li-
brary, the reactions of some in-
dividuals to the design of this
build ag, which will be realty in
four vears were quite pronounc-
ed.

The approved plan was the
second submitted by the firm of
Clark, Nexsen and Owen. The
first design which was unveiled
last October was of more tra-
ditional tines and met much op-
position.

The second plan combines a
modern touch with the tradi-
tional by the addition of two-
story windows on the front and
an atchway-window combination
around the sides and rear.

Chalmers G. Davidsen, chair-
man of the Library Planning
Committee said, “1! would hope
that there is enough of the con-
temporary and traditional in
the final facade of the library
to satisfy all points of view.”

However, many people were
not pleased with this compro-
inise of the contemporary and
traditional. Larry L. Ligo, in-
structor in art. belives that the
plan is a waste of a great po-
tential. To build a 18th century
building in the 20th century is
un immoral use of material.”

Another student who is very
inuch aguinst the library facade
is Ceci! Burney, “I think that it
is a shame to waste so much
inoney on a building so out of
touch with the 20th century.”

Burney called the second de
sign a “plastered up job.” He
expressed a strong desire for a
modeitn Library on campus and
believes that the present plan is
“uw hideous mistake.”

Other people feel that the final

design is a vast improvement
over the first. Ralph Peeples,
SGA _ president, said, ‘I think
that it is a lot better than the
first.” but added, ‘‘The princi-
ple involved in the change from
the original structure is the im-
portant thing. This is a case

where student opinion was lis-
tened to.”

Though most students seem to
express a strong preference to-
ward the modern, the prevail-
ing feeling is that the present
plan is an improvement over the
October plan.

Students Voice Concern
Over Course Registration

By JOHN CASSELS
Staff Writr

In the tradition of registra.
tion, students are once again
complaining of their situation.
Some freshmen have _ voiced
cencern and consternation over
the sparsity of courses offered
for the spring term.

The line outside Chambers
dining hall began forming in
early afternoon Tuesday, as
freshmen hoped to register for
the choice spots left over from
upperclassmen’s registration.

Many felt that with the fewer
number of courses offered, their
chances were bad.

When asked about the fewer
number of courses, Richard C.
Burts Jr.. registrar, said, ‘‘l
am not aware that there are
fewer courses offered in the
spring.”

Overall, the number of cours-
es offered in each department
was nearly the same as the fall
and winier terms. Burts pointed
out that several upper level
courses must be worked in dur-
ing the year for major require-
ments. and the administration
felt that several sections of
such courses (Matt. 25 26

were unnecessary in the spring
term.

Dean of Students Will H. Ter-
ry said, “I have not received as
many complaints on course of-

ferings and students being bump.
ed as I did in the fall and winter
terms.”

Terry felt that the extended
studies program helped to alle-
viate some of the previous prob-
lems, since students needed only
two courses in most cases.

‘I think part of the problem
is that upperclassmen are fill-
ing spaces in courses that should
have been saved for freshmen.”

Terry said, however, that
moves had been made through
particular departments to open
the classes up to more fresh-
men and sophomores who are
trying to fill their area require-
ments.

More advanced courses have
been offered spring term to
help upperclassmen fill major
requirements. consequently the
number of basic courses offered
suffered from this necessary
emphasis.
