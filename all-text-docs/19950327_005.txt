Nuevo restaurante
en Cornelius

By Ranpy HarTWELL
Staff writer

NAFTA’ s influence continues
to be felt in Cornelius with the
arrival of yet another Hispanic-
themed restaurant, Olé Olé. But
Guillermo Anzola, one of the
restaurant’s two partners, insists
that he is not competing for the
same demographics as Chile
Ristras and El Cancun. “Ours is
totally different,” he says.

Olé Olé, whose first and main
branch is on Kings Drive in Char-
lotte, has now opened in what used
to be Woody’s in a shopping cen-
ter off Highway 73 in Cornelius.
Its emphasis is not Mexican, but
more global: “Our cuisine is more
Spanish, more international,” says
Anzola, who is Colombian.

Olé Olé opened in Cornelius
because “‘our location in Charlotte
was too crowded,” says the owner.
This summer, he hopes to add:a
patio and to bring in live (Spanish)

Commentary

By MEREDITH STRONG &
CAROLINE BYNUM

As we packed our bags for
spring break none of us really knew
what to expect from the upcoming
week. We hit the road and in seven
hours arrived at Lakewood United
Methodist Church in Jacksonville,
Florida, which would be our home

. for the next seven days. Our work
week began early Monday morn-
ing when we met our construction
manager, John Davie.

The witty Brit led us over to
our construction site where we
found just a concrete slab and a
pile of wood. So our group of nine
girls and Ned went a-hammerin'
an'nailin’. Goal in mind, we worked
hard days and slept as much as we
could, but it was hard to compete
with the construction going onnext
door. We were good workers but
nowhere near as skilled as the pro-
fessionals. Davidson students be-

Eastside.

Habitat for Humanity was
founded in 1976 as a nonprofit,
ecumenical Christian housing
ministry that seeks to eliminate
poverty housing from the world

and to make decent shelter a matter
of conscience and action through
building and renovation. Houses
are sold for $35,000 at no profit to

music to take advantage of the
weather. The restaurant has used
Woody’s airy space to its maxi-
mum, embellishing it with replicas
of paintings by the Catalonian art-
ist Joan Miro and images of bull-
fights. A copy of Picasso’s
Guernica hangs over the bar, this
time in color.

The restaurant’s signature
dish, Paella Valenciana, described
on the menu as a “traditional recipe
of seafood and saffron rice,” sells
for $8.95 at lunch and $12.95 at
dinner. The lunch menu offers
combination plates, most for $5.95.
Dinner is more expensive, running
to $13.95 fora filet mignon. Of his
kitchen, Anzola says, “My chef is
doing always miracles!” Olé Olé
also offers many wines, most from
Spain and Chile, as well as im-
ported Mexican beers.

Anzola encourages Davidson
students to come try his restaurant.
“They can work on their Spanish,”
he says.

fordable, no-interest mortgages.
Habitat exists in 41 countries un-
der more than 1000 affiliates. Just
this year, 12,000 homes have been
built worldwide. Over 100,000

families now have homes thanks
to Habitat.. Nevertheless, millions

worldwide still face a future robbed
of hope by a lack of adequate shel-
ter. Some say the problem is too
big, but Habitat has proven them
wrong. Former president Jimmy
Carter, who has had a long-stand-
ing partnership with Habitat said,
“I don’t know of anything I’ve
ever seen that more vividly dem-
onstrates love in action.”

President Bill Clinton says,
“Habitat for Humanity is arguably
the most successful continuous
community service project in the
history of the United States.”

“People say a neighborhood

is bad, but.we go in there.and:make
it better. We are making a differ-

ence,” said Frank Barker, Execu-
tive Director of Habitat for Hu-
manity Jacksonville. Habitat has
transformed fivé neighborhoods
since its establishment in 1985;
crime rates have dropped and busi-
nesses have developed. It has
grown tobe the Sth largest affiliate
in the nation.

This year was the first year

that Davidson College has accepted

of Habitat for Humanity, takes on

see kids give up their spring break
to build affordable housing for
people who are less fortunate than
they,are. They’re out there with
their smiling faces and sweating,”
says Barker. 5,000 college kids
are out there this year and they’ ve
raised more than $300,000. We
