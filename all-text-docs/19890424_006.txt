Vogue fashion trends present at Davidson

By HEATH HARDAGE

Vogue, the international fashion
Bible of couture-watchers, has pro-
claimed SPRING ‘89 the season of
the “fit body.” Other watchwords on
trends in the garment industry in-
clude “bareness,” “emphasis on the
leg” and “athletic styling”. How-
ever, an anonymous Davidson man
gave a simpler definition of what he
had noticed in the new Spring looks:
“low-cut dresses, skin, boobs!”

Other trends cited by Vogue
were the dominance of Latin and
Cuban themes in clothing, which are
complemented by ethnic jewelry.
Trench coats, from the classic khaki
to shocking yellow silk, are a fashion
staple for blustery April weather.
Chiffon scarves, wrapped around the
head ala Audrey Hepburn are preva-
lent. Fake pearls are showing up on
everything, due in part to Barbara
Bush’s influence.

Bad news for those who acquired
a savage tan on Spring Break: tans
are out! Vogue declared in the April
issue that “a tan has become recog-
nized as a symptom of sun damage.”
Most students at Davidson do not
seem to subscribe to this theory, says

the same anonymous Davidson so- -

phmore: “everybody wears shorts
now. It’s like sport your tan...people
always wear white after vacation.”
He also notes that Davidson in the
spring is a “sneakers and t-shirt
place.” Fashion is “probably not that
important” at Davidson, he says.
Chris Fiore, a Davidson so-

the “Happy Days”

phmore, has worked for the sports-

wear company, Adrienne Vittadini,

as a market analyst. He has spotted —bucks. “Wide ties are-back more this _ ence at Vittadini, he has noticed that
look around spring,” and “watches are the big
campus: i.e. jeans, t-shirts, and white _ thing,’’he says. Based on his experi-

“There’s a big move’in fashion
companies to do a franchise on ac-
cessories.”

Will Pender, a Davidson fresh-
man, questioned this reporter as to
why he had been approached
about his opinion on spring fash-
ions: ““Why are you asking me
about spring fashion? Look at
how I’m dressed!” He finally
deigned to offer his appraisal of
the new trends: “Plaid is making a
spring statement” he proclaimed.
“Personally, I think girls ought to
wear bell-bottoms!”

Freshman Hilary Coman said “I
love the nautical looks this
spring...they re so cute and perky!
They really get me in the mood for
summer!” Elizabeth Howe, a resi-
dent of 4th Rich, noted that “on
my hall, everyone wears a lot of
Laura Ashley.”

Lauren Follmer of 1st Rich has
noticed that ““There’s a group who
always wears t-shirts and shorts,
and a group that wears cotton
dresses.” B’easy Helms, also of
Ist Rich, said that “Sometimes I
hate the spring because I always
have to shave my legs.”

Freshwoman Jenny Usherwood
has decided that “There is no
spring fashion [at Davidson].”
Everyone wears what they want.”
An anonymous Richardson fresh-
woman expressed more concern
about spring fashion: “I buy ali my
clothes in the boutiques in Char-

leston. I’d never buy anything in
North Carolina!”

FUTURE DOCS, from page 5

Although Williamson believed
it was possible for those with under
a 3.0 GPA to get into a medical
school, he said it would be “very
unlikely and improbable.”

“The number of people seeking
to go to med school is dramatically
down,” he also noted, saying that
there are now only 1.7 applicants for

each seat as opposed to earlier ap-
plications statistics closer to 3.7 per
seat. He added that Davidson
premed acceptance rates have gen-
erally been between 75 and 80 per-
cent for the past 20 years for first-
time applicants to medical school.

There are course requirements
for the premed major which are
weighed equally with overall

grades and test scores. Appropriate
courses in biology, chemistry,

mathematics and physics must be
taken.

“Historically, medical stu-
dents have been science majors,”
Williamson said. In fact, Davidson
offered a premedical major until
the current school year. A slim ma-
jority of senior Davidson premeds
are nonscience majors.

The classroom is not the only
site of learning for premeds. “One
thing that is critical is to obtain ex-
perience in a medical setting,”
stated Williamson.

With the high GPAs and other
forms of achievement expected of
premeds, a casual approach to
schoolis not the rule. “It’s very im-

portant to map out your schedule,”
warned Nagendren.

“It’s cut into my social life,”
Warlick noted, “especially this year
because of the higher levels of
classes required of premed stu-
dents,”

“You need to make sacrifices,”
Gillespie said. “It’s very tough. You
wouldn’t be a premed if you weren’t
going to make the sacrifice.”

But he added, “You don’t have
to be stressful about it.” He sug-
gested reading, exercising and allo-
cating personal time as useful tech-

niques for combatting mental fa-

tigue.
“You do need time to get

“Everybody has to work
hard at Davidson,” Srinivasan
argued, citing those intending
to go to law or management
school as being under similar
stresses.

Besides the workload, an-
other potential drawback to
those considering medical
school is money, “A premed
Student must consider long
before acceptance into medi-
cal school how he or she will
pay for it,” Williamson em-
phasized. i

For those uncertain about
their own medical school
plans, advice abounds at
Davidson. “Number one, and
most importantly: they should
get medical experience—ei-
ther in a hospital or in a clinic
or with a physician, in his
practice for example,” said bi-
ology professor Verna Case.
“Tthink that they should famil-
iarize’ themselves with the
medical schools in their home
State—visit the medical
schools and talk to medical
students,”

“My bestadvice would be
to take the premedical classes.
early so that if you’re unsure
[about majors], you'll always
have the option of medical
school,” she concluded. !
