Short Story

Continued from page 5

but Mr. and Mrs. Vanderland,
they’s gone to work, too. I guess
everybody’s got to have a job. I
does the dustin’, washin’ and
waxin’. I’m here to polish up and
shine. And that’s how I knows
Elizabeth Vanderland. Elizabeth,
she ain’t at Paradise no more. Her
maw dun sent her off to learn stuff
and left her there. I knows ‘bout
bein’ left, and it sure makes ya
learn stuff alright. ‘Lizbeth’s a
boarder. Ain’tnothin’ gonnacome
“tween me and her.

But today’s differen’ I thinks,
today Lizzy’s gonna come back
for a break. And I knows how
we’ ll be best friends ‘cause Iknows

how much she needs me. I knows
her so well already that I’s so ex-
cited to meet her.

Nothin’ in Lizzy’s room ever
changes, ‘cept dust settles down
everywhere. Ithought ‘boutsettlin’
down myself once, but with who?
Nobody never loved me. Mamas
don’tleave the children they loves.
Lizzy knows. She got sent off, like
you sends back a dress that’s the
wrong size or color. Lizzy’s 're-
turned.

I’s thinkin’ on the bus, I’s
thinkin’ how I wantto see her wear
them clothes in her closet, them
lacey white dresses with the
matchin’ shoes. They looks like
flowers, so clean and white, like
angel dresses. I knows Lizzy’s an
angel, too, ‘cause she’s got such

pretty clothes. Maybe she’d even
let me borrow them. I’m her same
size. I knows ‘cause I tried ‘em on
in fronta the dresser mirror, an’
Lizzy justa smiled up at me from
her picture, as if to say how it was
fittin’.

That’s how come I knows
she’s such a nice girl, too, ‘cause
she’s always smilin’ in every pic-
ture I sees. She’s smilin’ really
friendly-like, but always alone. I
knows what it’s like to be alone,
and not have no friends. “I’s your
friend.” I says to Lizzy’s pictures
every day. “I’s your real friend.”
Lizzy’s friends, they’s made up in
her mind. I knows ‘cause I reads it
in her diary. She makes up people
and then makes up things to hap-
pen to them, and Lizzy’s always
smack dab in the middle of the
story. I thinks that’s so sad, that
she pretends friends ‘cause she
don’t have none.

Lizzy don’t have no dolls nei-
ther. I guess that’s why she plays
in her mind. I didn’t have no toys,
but I couldn’t use none no how,
didn’t have time. I had to grow up
fast, and now I’s too old for my
age. ButI’s nottoo old fora friend,
one to play house with. a

I wishes I had me a present, a
real present I could share with Liz.
(The bus stops by the gate.) Present
or not, I thinks, I’s here. When I
gets off I sees them white queen’s
lace flowers grow’n up on the other
side of fence. I reaches out a hand
and pulls. I pick’s them for Liz.
T’ll give them to her presently,

I’snearly runnin’ up the drive.
I’s so dizzy with thinkin’. ‘bout
Liz, my head’s swimmin’, my
heart’s poundin’, and my hands,
they’s sweatin’ so’s I can hardly
holdtothem flowers without gettin’
them bent outa shape. These is
Liz’s presence after all, so I gotta
be careful.

What’ll she say when she sees
me? I goes in the back door and
Strait up the stairs. When I reaches
her room I sees her. She’s big as
life, and it takes me a time ‘fore I
recognizes her ‘cause she ain’t
smilin’ like in her picture. Her
face is flushed all red. She’s gotta
be excited ‘bout me, too, I thinks.
I steps toward her and I sees tears
in her eyes— how miserable her
life’s been! 2

“Liz—” I says but she cuts me
off.

“To you I am Miss Elizabeth
Shoreham Vanderland, and these
are my belongings. I do not know

_ what you were looking for; how-

ever, you greatly misjudged me if
you thought I would take no no-
tice. Well, have you anything to
say for yourself?” —

I’s stunned. My tongue’s
swelled up sos even if’n I know’d
what to say I couldn’t say nothing.
Face down, I turn’s back, and ‘hind
me I sees the dirt trail that’d
follow’d me from the time I’d
picked the present in the garden.
Well, I thinks, there’s another mess

I got’s to clean up, but really I’s_ -

what needs be swept out... They’s
right. I’s messed in the head.

“I see.” says Miss Elizabeth
real short and stern, but she don’t.
And I don’t neither.

The Industrial
Sound of the Grunge
Band The Ministry

by Peter Arnold
While I personally have noth-
ing against country music (actu-
ally Ido. itmakes me violently ill),

it is time that The Davidsonian |

present an (catchword here) AL-
TERNATIVE MUSICCOLUMN.
This column will attempt to shine
some light on music that you would
not ordinarily hear on the John-
Boy and Billy show. No singular
musical style will dominate. O.K.
Here is this week’s drivel. .

Instead of the normal “‘Paren-
tal Advisory: Explicit Lyrics” la-
bel that this band was forced to put
on the cover of their albums, the
label should read, “Attention:
Guaranteed To Scare The Hell Out -
Of Your Parents.” The band is
Ministry, headed by the enigmatic
Alien Jourgensen. This guy is truly
bizarre. The music is (another
catchword) INDUSTRIAL, a mu-
tated form of speed metal popular-
ized in the summer of ‘91 by Nine
Inch Nails at the first Lollapalooza
concert. Basically it is inhumanly
fast and loud, with drum machines
and synthesizers making up the
bulk of the noise. Using a thou-
sand different effects, Jourgensen
screams his lyrics in a way that
makes him sound like the anti-
Christ. In addition to Jourgensen’s.
yelling, the band throws in a few
samples utilizing everything from
movies to other band’s lyrics.

If you do not have any Minis-
try albums, go out right now and
buy the old live one entitled, Jn
Case You Didn't Feel Like Show-
ing Up. The cover depicts a guy

putting his head through acar wind- ©
shield and eating the dashboard.
This album comes as close as pos-
sible to a live Ministry show and
includes their hits (if you can call
them that): “Deity,” “So What,”
“Thieves,” and “Stigmata.” Every
time I listen to these guys I find
myself gritting my teethand punch-
ing things. This seems to be a
fairly universal reaction because
when I went to see Ministry, I
witnessed many people gritting
their teeth and punching each other.

Their shows are another story.
Before Perry Farrell signed them
onto the new Lollapalooza tour
last summer, Ministry was con-
fined to dingy hardcore clubs that
make 13-13 look like the Adlanta
Symphony Hall. My brother said
that in Milwaukee, the promoter
had constructed a double thick
chain-link fence from floor to ceil-
ing to keep the fans from killing
the band. In a club like this, the
loudness musthave passed the pain
threshold because I saw them out-
side and couldn’t hear for a week
afterwards. -

This band is good. Buy their
albums and listen to them as loud
as you can stand. The new album,
Psalm 69: The Way To Succeed

_ andThe WayToSuckEges.is good. .

too, but I can’t tell you too much
about it because someone came
over to my house and stole it. I
hope you are enjoying it, person!

So there is a taste of Ministry.
Look forward to next week’s ar-
ticle on some other band, possibly
Pantera.
