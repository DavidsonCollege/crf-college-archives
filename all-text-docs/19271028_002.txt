News and Views of
Wildcat Events

By Raymond Lake

Another tie! We'll just have to hand it to
the Deacons. They certainly played a great
game of football. The Wildcats were ex- |
pected to take the game by at least two touch- |
downs, but when the fight was ovér, the Da-|
vidson backers wére mighty glad the score
was tied. It looked gloomy for a while, but |
the old Wildcat couldn’t stand to go off hold- |
ing the wrong end of the sack,, and they
staged a great comeback which tied the score. |

|

From one point of view the result of Sat-
urday’s game will be a great help to the
Wildcats. We can’t win all the time and it's
better to be tied than to be beaten, especially
when being tied means a better chance to
win the next game and the one after that. |
The Wildcats will fight harder and pull to-!
gether better against the V. M. I. eleven this |
week after being, brought down a peg by the |
Deacons, and also in the State game a week
from Saturday. The Wolfpack trounced the
Deacons several weeks ago and*came. out
about four touchdowns ahead, and..they’re

going to put out all they've got on Novem- |

ber 5th in an attempt to get that old cham-
pionship title.

The V. M. I. Cadets will also be fighting
hard when they meet the Wildcats, but in
our opinion they won't have near as good a
chance to come ‘out ahead as they would have
had if Davidson had licked the Deacons as
they were expected to do. The Cadets seem
to have a pretty hard situation ahead of them.
They're playing the Wildcats on their home
field just the week after they've been humbled
quite a bit, and such a combination is hard to
beat. The game this week may result in an-
other tie, but our prediction is that the home
team won't be béaten.

although the game could not be won by both
teams, the Freshmen were just the lucky
ones to drop in the final point. At the close
of the half the Freshmen were leading by the

WILDCATS PLAY SLOW

For some time the game |
was extremely slow and neither team showed
the expected form, After some unspirited |
play and no unusual gains a quarter had |
dragged by in which there was nothing but |
disappointment to the rival rooters. |

The second quarter was more lively than
the first period and the Wildcats started driv-
ing in a way that began to pep up things a
bit and it looked as though they were going
over the coveted marker with one continuous
drive. When the distance had been shortened
the Deacons looked over the congregation as
though they owned the world and the anxious
*Cats bounced off their forms four times and
the oval changed hands. James took the ball
behind his own goal line and with a mighty
punt that drifted over the head of Dick Grey,
put the Presbyterians back on the offensive
on their own 35-yard marker, warding off the
first serious attack of the Wildcats.

In this period the Davidson team again got
off to some good gains and after having put
the ball on the Baptists’ 35-yard line Grey
missed an attempted field goal and again the
Deacons punted back to the territory of the
opponents. After thé ball changed hands, the
Deacons started some drive atid an attempted
field goal from the 35-yard line was wide, and
the very draggy half was over.

Dynamite seemed to have been inserted in-
to the shoes of Johnny Cox during the half
as he received a kick-off and pulled the first
spectacular play of the _game as he raced
around Davidson's left end and down the
sideline to the first touchdown, with no ene
near him. The kick for extra point was good

ing at the speed of this little Deacon who

Goodykoontz Chosen to
Captain Freshman Team

Freshmen Choose Former High
School Star As Captain

Dan Goodykoontz, flashy halkback for the
Davidson College Freshmen, has been chosen
by his teammates to captain thé team during
the 1927 season. :

Goodykoontz, who was a star for the Blue-
field, West Virginia, High School, is a cousin
of the redoubtable Harry Goodykoontz, for-
mer football player, and captain of the track

‘

‘He is a consistent ground
gainer, beside being a dangerous broken field
runner. In the Wofford game last week he
got away for two thrilling runs of 20 yards,
and was one of the mainstays of the Wildkit-
ten team throughout the game.

In the latter part of the game with Wof-
ford he received a minor injury to his leg
which

to rest until Tuesday before he was able to

After a.brief consultation the: Wildcats de-

page led largely by Grey. After two first
downs had been made, Dick Grey went
around right end for 23 -yards only to be
called back for an off-side penalty. A long
pass was good and the ball was on the 12-
yard line of the Deacons, and from here it
went over via line plays for Davidson's first
score.

Davidson and Duke

Harriers Run Here

meet the Duke team on October 29, home-
coming day. This will be the first meet
of the team this year and the outcome
is expected to be a close-one. The Duke
team has been practicing for a five mile
race with Washington and Lee, and they
will be in good condition for the meet
with Davidson. Duke has a coach who
‘has been devoting his entire time to their
cross-country team, and the Duke team
will be well trained. p

The seven men to run against Duke on
home-coming day were selected during
the past week by a time trial on the reg-
ular three and a half mile course. These,
men in the order in which they finished
are: Lafferty, Nunan, Treverton, Sloop,
Jeavers, H. -E, Russell, and Brownell,
Goodwin came in second but will not be
able to run on the cross-country team this
year. The time of the first time trial was
21 minutes and 3 seconds, The men go-
ing out for the team have been working
hard since the first part. of September.
They are keeping rigid training regula-
tions and have been, running several
miles every afternoon, and will be in good
conditions for Duke on homecoming day.

his line plays which took the Deacons off
their feet and the ball was'rushed over, while
Dick Grey kicked a very large single point
after the touchdown,

After Wake Forest had kicked to David-
son, the game was over.

Both teams were off: form because of in-
juries and caused the game to be a little slow
at times. The story could not end without
giving honorable mention to Mr. Johnny Cox,
the Deacon. James did some great punting,
keeping the kicks well placed, and W. Weir
was always down after them. For David-
son, Grey and Harrison were fastest in their
gaining, and Ed Wilson's generatship could
not be, overlooked. Laws played an outstand-
ing game in the line.
