Council President
Announces Plans

Dee Green, president of
Davidson's Student Council,
rapped the gavel for the
first meeting last Monday.
Among the topics of dis-
cussion was a proposal to
center Friday chapel per-
iods around discussions
concerning various campus
topics.

On Fridays when little time
is taken by announcements,

important subjects such as cur-
riculum changes, compulsory

vespers, and facility expansions
could be presented to the stu-
dent body in a discussion type
program. This proposal is ex-
pected to be presented formal.
ly at next Monday’s meeting.

Other topics slated for the
Council’s next meeting will
be a discussion on Chapel

and Vesper’s conduct and
Student Councit membership

in the National Student Asso-
ciation.

The Council stressed that’ no

‘firearms will be permitted on

campus unless they are stored
in the cage provided by the
ROTC department. Tom Hud-
gins will be in charge of the
gun cage this year.

Tommy Colvin will present
an analysis of the pros and cons
of continued affiliation with
the National Student Associa-
tion at the meeting next Mon-
day night.

At last Monday's meeting

bers were appointed to Col-

Selected Recollections Of

An R.O.T.C. Camp Cadet

“Okay, everybody up.”

My eyes opened to meet the harsh glare of the light bulb that had just come

on directly above my bed. Outside the stars were still shining in the unillumined sky.
“What time is it, Hecht,” I bad begun. ;

asked the rather obese Jewish
boy that bunked next to me, at
the same time pulling on his
big toe that always extended
from beneath his sheet, to
make sure that he was awake.
I sometimes wondered why one
of Norm's legs always hung
out. I guess that there was just
not enough sheet to cover him
all.

“It's four-thirty,” he said.
That was what 1 was afraid of

Halls Select Frosh
Council Members

Members of the Class of
1963 will elect representa-
tives to the Freshman
Council in hall meetings
next week. Each dormitory
hall will elect two repre-
sentatives; each basement,
one; by Wednesday, Sep-
tember 30.

The first meeting of the
Council will be held immediate-
ly following the election. Of-
ficers will be elected at the end
of the first grading period.

The first meetings of the
council will be devoted to ac-
quainting the body with its du-
ties and scope. In addition to
its traditional responsibilities
of planning Freshman Parent's
Day and Freshman-Sophomore
Field Day, the Council will pro-

Time for the dally morn-
ing clean-up—Make the beds
(don’t forget the hospital cor-
ners)—G.!. the letrine—wax
the floor and buff it. Oh nuts,
the buffer is broken.

But for “men” with several
weeks of military training be-
hind them, this was nothing.
Quickiy our old friend Norm
was paged. He Jay down in a
blanket spread on the floor
while four of the huskier lads
grasped cach of the four cor-
mers. Then they proceeded to
bump Norm’s spacious baywin-
dow along the floor giving it
the best buff job it had had for
many a year.

Things could have been
worse and, in fact, were in
the platoon next door where
football co-captain Charlie
Benson was residing. The
serge in this particular out-
fit was so tough thet he used
Briilo for a tooth brush and
Clorox for deordorant.

One day Charlie was’ playing
the radio and the sarge decid-
ed that nothing this civilized
would go on_in his platoon so
he proceeded to take it away.
Charlie was a little peeved so
the sarge, perhaps experienc-
ing a pang of conscience, said
that he could have the set back
if he would give him a hundred
push-ups.

So Charlie, despite a few
grunts and groans toward the
end, knocked out a hundred
quick ones. The sarge, trying
hard not to show his approval,
immediately quipped “That's
pretty good, Benson, now give
me fifty more and you can.
‘have the cord.”

But despite the hectic parts,
‘summer camp was a valuable
' experience. For not only did
lit equip the cadets that attend-
,ed@ with the knowledge that we
, Will need when we are commis.
{sioned, it also was an experi-

ence in living with people of
different races, faiths, and
backgrounds such as we will be
associated with when we leave
our beloved center of Southern
Presbyterianism and venture
out into the “real world.”

Governor Selects
Hopkins, Alumnus

Dr. John I. Alopxins. asso-
ciate professor of Physics and
J. Atwell Alexander of Stony
Point, a Davidson graduate of
tn class of 1929, are newly
ippointed members of a 35-
..ember Atomic Energy Advis-
ory Committee, recently an-
nounced by Governor Hodges.

The 1959 North Carolina
General Assembly authorized
the appointment of this com-
mittee, with the members ap-
pointed by the Governor. The
Commissioner of Agriculture,
the State Superintendent of
Public Instruction, and the
State Health Director will serve
as ex officio members.

Dr. Hopkins is a former re-
search physicist at the Oak
Ridge Laboratory, employed by
the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion. Before coming to David-
son last year, he was at Van-
derbilt University where he was
professor of Physics and was
continuing research for the
Atomic Energy Commission un-
der a special research contract.

Mr. Alexander, a prominent
poultry farmer, has served a
term to the N. C. State Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and last
summer was one of the Tar
Heels chosen for the fifth
“Farm Opportunities and Mar-
keting Caravan,” an  out-of-
‘state farm tour to Jowa.

Both of these members will
serve two-year terms on -the
Atomic Energy Advisory Com-
mittee.

The administration urges all

This year Davidson has
eight foreign students under
the Richardson Foundation
program. There are several
other foreign students on
cam-s who entered under
diffu.ent programs before
‘September 1958, and these
men are regular degree can-
didates.

Next year the student body
at Davidson will include a stu-
dent from Greece and possibly
students of English or Dutch
ancestry from South Africa.

Eventually most of David-
son's foreign students will be
supported by the Richardson
Foundation Scholarships. Under
this plan a student spends one

turns to his own country. The
