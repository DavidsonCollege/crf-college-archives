Purchasing Power
& the Ivory Tower

The typical college student, not yet burdened by the slings and arrows
of making a living and inspired by great philosophy and literature, develops
an aversion to the money-grubbing of the real world.

We learn from Hobbes that money, something we can never get enough
of, is inherently scarce and, therefore destined to be an object of greed and
a constant source of conflict. In a capitalistic society like the U.S., to gain
money is to succeed, and only the great thinkers or the great public servants
manage to transcend this pervasive definition of success.

These days, we are constantly faced with the evils that center around
money, from thieving evangelists to strip malls to inside traders. We are
bombarded with businesses looking out for number one, trying to get
whatever the market will bear, and fast-food strips like our lovely Cornelius
make suburban America a commercial squalor.

But we often forget the good that can involve money, that ever-scarce
commodity. We need not look past the grounds of Davidson College to see
where money does great good. Generous alumni have helped our endow-
ment campaign achieve phenomenal success, and scholarships enable
talented students to partake of Davidson’s growing resources. We can’t
study without books, and we can’t get books without money. Don’t be
deceived; money is mainly what brought Davidson to its highest U.S. News
ranking ever.

So let us not, as idealistic young students, fall prey to the sophism that
money is the root of all evil. It is an instrument of evil, as it can be an
instrument of good. Whatever course of study we choose, as college
students we find ourselves searching constantly for an answer to the
questions, “What is the good life?” and “How can I succeed?” To the
average Davidson student who, despite periodic delusions of brilliance,
will never contribute to the academic world in any great fashion, we address
the following answer:

Make a lot of money, and get your name on a building.

LETTERS

B. J., stick with us

To the editors,

We are writing in re-
sponse to B. J. Rudell's let-
ter which appeared in the
September 12 issue of The
Davidsonian.

_B.J., your sarcasm and
general attitude are out of
line. You proposed your
idea, those with an interest
in the matter: discussed it,

and the idea was rejected.
Period. There is no reason
for you to take it personally.

Furthermore, and most
importantly, there is abso-
lutely no call for you to dis-
miss out of hand the objec-
tions to a new basketball
court.

These objections: are
valid ones, and you, as our

representative, are supposed
to take the views of every-
one into account, not just the
views of those who share
your opinion, no matter what
the issue. We hope you will
remember that in the future.
Sincerely,
Molly Green, '95
Sarah Patterson, '95

To the Editors,

In response to B.J.
Rudell’s mildly caustic let-
ter- in last week’s
Davidsonian, all 1 can re-
ally say is, “B.J., please re-

lax. While I’m sure the
issue of where to put a new

basketball court is very im-
portant to you and the mil-
lions of disenfranchised
basketball players spread all
over this campus, please try
to keep a sense of perspec-
tive. IT IS JUST A BAS-
KETBALL COURT!”
Myself, along with many
people who I have spoken
with, believe too muchtime,
effort, discussion, and ink
have already been devoted
to a topic which, to tell the
truth, is not that crucial to
the campus’s well-being.
Mr. Rudell’s letter, while
written with the most heart-
felt and good intentions, is
fighting for this cause in a
way that is counterproduc-
tive and ineffective. Todis-
cuss this fly in the ointment
any further is forcing noth-
ing into something, and
making it into too much of
an issue. As _ Billy
Shakespeare might say,
B.J.’s letter is “full of sound
and fury, signifying noth-
ing.”

Mr. Rudell prefaces his
defense of the new court
witha convoluted and inco-
herent analogy linking bas-
ketball with beer drinking
and beer-buying. Maybe
he sees the logic in this strat-
egy, but I simply do not. I
can say from personal ex-
perience that if you drink a
lot and play basketball at
the same time, ‘you will
probably vomit (Hint to the
freshmen: Do not, I repeat,
DO NOT participate in the

Basketball Score-a-rama
booth during Lunar Luau if
you have been drinking).
Now, I understand
where B.J. is coming from.
The court in its current con-
dition is not the best. In fact,
itis sort of like swimming in
a dirty pond: it’s swimming,
but it’s just not the same.
However, it is not inconceiv-
able to repair the court. A
new coating of asphalt, afew
new goals, and some paint

_would do that place some

good. In fact, it would prob-
ably equal playing condi-
tions on the proposed court,
but with less inconvenience.
The 300 foot “defender” is a
problem for only one of the
courts, yet the other court
could be hassle-free with
some help from the school.
This obstacle free court
would have an approxi-
mately equal area as the pro-
posed court. So what’s the
only remaining hassle?
Trees, it seems. B.J. tells us,
“Overhanging ’ branches
hinder outside shooting.”

Iseemtoremember that
Davidson has an arborist’s
department that might be
very happy to trim back these
overhanging branches if
asked. Thathurdle is cleared.
As for the light post on the
other court, you could turn it
into a shrine, dress it up like
a woman, or film a
McDonalds commercial
there. I can imagine Larry
Bird playing out there, say-
ing, “From my. chest, to
Michael’s ugly bald noggin,
off the lightpost, nothing but
net...”

The alternative does not
seem really fair. The new
court might be free the first

. year of existence, but what

of the cost after that? Rumor

has it that the court will cost
the school thousands of dol-
lars a year to maintain after
the inaugural year. That cer-
tainly does not sound free of
charge as Mr. Rudell would
have us believe. ;

Furthermore, after look-
ing at the proposed site, it
seems as if only about 15
might be able to play in such
a space before overcrowd-
ing became an issue. YetB.J.
seems to think accommodat-
ing 15 average ball players
is a more important cause
than providing a safe, con-
venient place to park for
Davidson students, many of
whomare women who might
otherwise be forced to walk
from a more distant, less
well-lit spot. Trading safety
for basketball does not seem
to be a viable option.

B.J., you were elected
to the S.G.A. to voice our
concerns and torepresent us,
yet you keep beating a dead
horse that most of us do not
feel ever should have been
alive in the first place, and I
think last week’s S.G.A. vote
proves that.. I hope you
won’t be bitter, despite the
fact that your letter is laced
with bitterness. If you really
want to pursue a worthwhile
issue, however, I will com-
pletely support your sugges-
tion to widen all the hall-
ways and doorways so that
we could park in our rooms.
Maybe then you could use
the old parking. places to
make an enormous basket-
ball complex.

Until that happens,
though, I will not support
your suggestion for the new
court.

Most Respectfully,
Alan W. Stump Il
