Leading a dog’s life at Davidson.

Munce steps

to Baskin

By BRAD SWALWELL
Senior News Editor

John Munce stepped down
as SGA President at the
Senate meeting Tuesday night
after swearing in’Bo Baskin as
the new president. Baskin won
the presidency by one of the
largest margins ever recorded
in an SGA election.

Also, the Senate confirmed
and Munce swore in all unopp-
osed candidates in Tuesday’s
election.

Taking the oath of office
were: Karl Goodhouse as Un-
ion president; Jack Golden as
WDAYV station manager; Rob-
ert Mayer as social committee

chairman; Robert Hutchinson ~

and Sue McAvoy as Quips and
Cranks editors; Matthew Cov-
ington as The Davidsonian
editor; John McArthur as
YM/YWCA president; Mark
Scandling as YM/YWCA vice
president; Marcee Morris as
YM/YWCA secretary; and
Katherine Morton as YM/
YWCA treasurer.

Baskin will swear in all
candidates elected in Tues-
day’s election at the first
Senate meeting in January.

The Senate conducted a
review of their activities over
the last three months and
Munce commented on areas of
concern for the Senate in the
future.

“I see three big areas of
concern for the Senate. These
are areas which the Senate will
have to watch very closely.

“First, there is our involve-
ment with the formulation of
the college budget. We have
our foot in the door here and
we need to keep it in.

“Second, we need to parti-
cipate in the defining of the
educational program at Dav-
idson.

“And third, we have to
work on understanding the
governance system of the col-
lege so that we can use the
procedures to our benefit,”
said Munce.

Munce also stressed an atti-
tude of cooperation between
members of the college com-
munity.

“We must be part of the
community. But we must
never be afraid to confront any
member of the community.
Cooperation does not exclude
confrontation,’’ he said.

Baskin also had some com-
ments on the Senate’s per-
formance during the last three’

BASKIN

“If there’s one thing I’ve
learned this year, it is this:
The SGA can get something
done, but it’s going to be done
outside Senate meeting. Sen-
ate meeting is important, but
it is not a substitute for good
hard work,” said Baskin.

Also at the meeting, the
Senate heard a preliminary
report from Karl. Goodhouse
on a new set of Union By-laws.

“The major change is the
addition to the Union Board of
two faculty members and two
administration/staff mem-
bers. This was done so that
Union Board decisions reflect
the ideas of all members of the
community,’ said Goodhouse.

as health hazzards

The stray dogs on campus
will be impounded this week
because they create health and
safety problems.

“The dogs have been a
concern of house managers,
Scotty Nichols and student
officers since the beginning of
the year,’’ said Robert Currie,
the College Business Mana-
ger. ‘‘Now the Mecklenburg
County Health Department is
concerned.”’

The County Health regula-
tions have been changed re-
cently; they now state the
presence of pets in dorms is

unsanitary.

Dorm regulations forbid
dogs in dorms, but, according
to Currie, cannot be enforced
because of the stray dogs.

‘Because the dogs have no
homes students let them into
dorms at night, where they
roam around, leaving debris
and making the housing con-
ditions unsanitary. The lobby
of Belk is the worst,”’ said Will
Terry.

Both Terry and Currie think
the majority of students don’t
like dogs in dorms and think
they are nuisances in general.

The stray dogs | pose a safety
problem too; one might bite a
student. Because they aren’t

tagged, the strays probably
have not been vaccinated for
rabies. No student has been
bitten by a dog this year.

Currie said, ‘‘I feel it is the.
college’s responsibility to pro-'
tect the students from this
possibility.’’

Student officers, house
managers, members of the
college staff and administra-
tion and Davidson Mayor
Sadler met with Mecklenburg
County Health official John F.
Brunly December 16 to dis-
cuss the stray dog problem.

“There is no question about

Jonas attempts to organize
practical education course

By KARL GOODHOUSE
Staff Writer

Junior Wayne Jonas is at-
tempting to develop a three
course program in group pro-
cesses that would run for an
entire academic year.

In an attempt to ‘‘get people \

to have more control over their
education and lifestyle, in-
stead of having it given to
them,’”’ the- program would
corabine in-class work with
practical education.

The first term would be
devoted to a study of group
processes, in the hope that
those involved can learn to co-
cooperate within a group situa
tion. In the second term, the
members of the group would
study the present and future
needs of Davidson College.
Third term work would be
devoted to choosing means of
implementation for those pro-
posals and to an attempt to
implement them.

Thus far, Jonas has drawn
up a tentative course outline
and syllabus. He is presently
contacting students, to poll
their interests and professors,
to find a course sponsor.

The main problem Jonas
has encountered is that people

are ‘‘interested only in parts of
the course, which is valid, but
tends to divide the series. This
weakens it because the main
goal is letting people learn how
to function as a group without
‘stumbling over their own
fo6e.

Jonas attributes this more
to fear on the part of students
than anything else. To commit
oneself to the whole program
will ‘‘take some soul-search-
ing,” he said. He also forsees a
conflict with the administra-
tion over acceptance of the
final course. By fall registra-
tion, Jonas hopes to have his
program approved by the
necessary faculty committees.
He also hopes to have comp-
leted an overall course outline,
a detailed outline of the first

part, and to have solid com-
mitments from student parti-
cipants.

So far it has been totally
Jonas’ effort. He has done
little to publicize the course,
‘ust talked to people (profes-
sors and students).”

His immediate goal is ‘‘to
gain a little more autonomy
for individuals in deciding
what their education will con-
sist of and how their life- styles
will be form

He sees basically the same
long-term goal, ‘‘but as con-
cerns whatever function one
participates in--that is, learn-
ing what it takes to be in
control of your life.’’
