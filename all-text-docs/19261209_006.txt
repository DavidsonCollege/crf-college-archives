Ministerial Band
Studies Missions

Last Sunday’s. meeting of the Ministerial
Band was rather unique in that no definite
program or speaker had been planned before- |
hand. After a short song service A. J. Cox |
and J. M. Murchison led in prayer. C. F,
McRae tread the scripture from the Gospels
of John and Matthew.

E. K. Regen, ’26, now a member of the
first year class at Louisville Theological |
Seminary, was asked to speak. He brought |
greetings from the Davidson men at Louis-
ville, and then made a short talk to the Band.
His subject was found in Romans 12:1: “T
beseech you therefore, brethren, by. the
mercies of God that you present your bodies
a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God,
which is your reasonable service.”

Paul in writing to the Christians at Rome,
the power of its time, faced a situation much
like the ministers of Christ are facing in
America today. Amid all: of” its temporal
power a nation makes religion a matter of
form rather than of practice, But a na-
tions’
more influence than his words that it little
mattets what he believes if he does wrong.

In the second place, our bodies must be
living sacrifices. The place of the dead of-
ferings like the burnt offerings of the Old
Testament has been taken by Christ’s sacri-
fice for mankind. We are now to live for
Him and in our daily life to take some part
in His Great Plan. This opportunity of
thus sharing in the greatest work in the
world should be considered a duty as well as
a privilege, since God has commanded us to
carry His Gospel to the uttermost parts of
the earth.

The.“One Bad Day” that Davidson foot-
ball: teams seem doomed to have each year,
struck with all its devastating force in the
Turkey Day classic with Furman, and the
Hurricane swept to a 28-0 victory. David-
son had hoped to win, but failed.

‘Captain Weems Has
| Interesting Record

| Military Science and Tactics, who came
| to Davidson in the fall of 1923 from Fort

| Benning, Ga., where he was stationed as | ; P ;
lall gave in a very liberal way.

re instructor in machine gun work, has
been here at Davidson since that time
!and will remain until next June, when his
| tour of duty expires.

Captain Weems is a native of Waverly,

Tenn. a farmer by birth and preference |
but an army man in spite of it. He at-|
| tended Southwestern Presbyterian Col- |
lege at Clarksville, Tenn. where ‘has
was a leader in campus activities and a}
member of the Alpha Tau Omega frater- |
nity. Upon graduation there he entered |
the United States Military Academy at |
| West’ Point. There has was one of the
outstanding men of his class, being light- |
heavyweight wrestling champion, cente
on the football team and a cadet captain
during his senior year. He graduated
with the class of 1917.

He entered active army service upon
graduation and remained there until
America’s entrance into the world war.
He went overseas among the first mem-
bers of the A. E. F., as a first lieutenant,
to be promoted shortly afterwards to the
rank of captain, commanding the ma-
chine gun company of the oth, infantry,
2nd division. Later he was promoted to |
the rank of Major, commanding a bat-|
talion of the oth infantry, 2nd division. |
Finally he was placed in command of the
fourth machine gun battalion, 2nd di-
vision, with which organization he re-
turned to this country to Fort Sam Hous-
ton, San Antonio, Texas.

In France, Captain Weems served in
the trenches near St. Mihiel and later
near Verdun. He took part in the
memorable battle of Chateau Thierry, be-
ing slightly wounded twice. He was
three times cited in the orders of the
United States Army for gallantry in
action, was awarded the French Croix
de Guerre and the Italian Order of .the
Crown, :

Upon his return to this country he
was ordered to Fort Bentling as a ma-
chine gun instructor and three years
later he was detailed to Davidson.

Captain Weems’ achievements in army
life have been notable. He is a leading
authority on machine guns and was
designated to review that portion of the
R. O. T. C. Manual dealing with the sub-
ject. Also he was chief of the board of
\review of the latest edition of the Manual.

Since coming to Davidson, Captain
Weems has come to be one of the col-
lege’s most ardent supporters. More-
over, he has aided the school in large
measure by his outside work. He has
coached the wrestling team of the col-
lege for the past three years and turned
out one of the best aggregations in the
South last year. In recognition of his
services in this capacity, the “D” Club
last year elected him to honorary mem-
bership in that organization, he being the
fourth man ever to receive the distinc-
tion. Captain Weems is still an athlete
of no mean ability, being a star polo
player.

‘Through the untiring etforts of Captain
Weems, the R. O. T. C. department has
reached a: very high level of proficiency,
being awarded the Distinguished Rating
last year—an honor shared only with

some seven or eight colleges of the south,

The last “Y” service of this year will be
the annual student musical program. The
Glee Club, together with the student body,
will use Christmas music entirely in this
worship and the whole meeting will consist
of this, as no talks will be made. Every
member of the college should plan to be at
this service. It will be full of Christmas
cheer and fellowship, and one that will put
us in the proper mind to best enjoy our holi-
days. it is with a great
deal of pleasure that the “Y” observes a
marked increase in the number attending
“Y.” This fact alone is a source of satisfac-
tion to the “Y” officers and one that they
hope will continue to be a revenue of pleas-
ure,

The Y gave a social for the boys that
remained on the Hill over the holiday.
About sixty-five boys that did not go to
the game or to their homes enjoyed this |
feed immensely. The feed was held in|
the Y rooms, which were very tastefully
decorated for the occasion. This feed
was planned by the Y social committee
to entertain the students.
met the needs of a means to entertain
the boys that stay on the campus for the
holidays. The social was anounced in
chapel and the whole student body was
invited to attend.

The hall was attractively adorned with
fall flowers and autumn leaves. The
orange colors that draped the: hall pre-
sented a striking background for the oc-
casion. The gay spirit of the boys,
aroused by the reports of the game, was
well in keeping with the occasion.

The reception committee composed of
Mrs. Martin, Mrs, Williams, Mrs. Fore-
man, and Mrs. Mebane was very much
enjoyed by» the boys. They had ar-
ranged everything so completely, and
they too seemed to enjoy the occasion.
They served hot chocolate to all present,
while the guests most graciously helped

were placed on several small tables.
Pumpkins filled with luscious fruits were
in easy reach of the boys.

The social was such a success that the
Y will probably repeat thé occasion on
other holidays. Such is the wish of
those that attended the social on last
Thursday afternoon.
