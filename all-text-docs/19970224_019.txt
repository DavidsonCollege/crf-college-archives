Road to Greensboro goes through Statesboro for women
Wildcats must pursue preseason goals away from Belk Arena

After last season’s break-
through performance, the women’s
basketball team came into the 1996-
97 campaign with high hopes and
expectations.

The team

Last season, the team won a
program-high 14 games and ful-
filled a season-long goal by ad-
vancing to the Southern Confer-
ence semifinals in Greensboro.

This year’s Wildcats vowed to
take the next step.

“We’re not going to be satis-
fied with just getting to Greens-
boro,” said coach John Filar:at
October’s media tip-off.

Filar had more than enough
reason to believe that his team was
capable - seven key players returned.

In addition, Davidson- wel-
comed its second consecutive top-
notch recruiting class, featuring
guard Jen O’Brien and center Katy
Kamp.

There were indeed plenty of
reasons to aim high. “This is prob-
ably the most excited the staff and I
have ever been going into a sea-
son,” Filar remarked.

After a slow start, the team and
its high hopes began to flash the
signs of developing into something
special. By the end of December,
the Wildcats had reeled off five
straight victories en route to a best-
ever 7-2 start. :

Battling several key injuries,
the squad was sparked by great play
from the bench and the emergence
of a primetime player:

_ Senior Carolyn Kirsch, an ag-
ile forward with a quick release, put
the team on her shoulders. She was
named MVP of the Cheesebrough-
Ponds Invitational in December,
scoring 35 points and grabbing 18
boards during the two-day journey.

Her spectacular season was just
beginning.

As the league docket began,
Kirsch and the Wildcats continued

their success, winning their initial
three SC games in both convincing
and dramatic fashion.

Then came the roadblock - a
five-game losing streak - in the
middle of the conference season.
Back-to-back losses to conference
leader Furman over the first week-
end in February left Davidson all
alone in sixth place witha 3-5 record.

“This team is not going to give
up,” said an optimistic Filar after
the second loss to the Paladins.
“They’re fighters and we’ll be
back.”

Filar was right. There were too
many goals left unachieved. This
team had way too much promise to
quit in early February.

Davidson responded, winning
four of their next five. Kirsch con-
tinued to put up conference-player-
of-the-year numbers. Jamie Brown,
who missed a lot of action early due
toa sprained ankle, staked her claim
as aconsistent scorer and rebounder.
O’Brien became a regular in the
Starting lineup, bringing a solid all-
around game.

Amidst all of the changes,
records fell by the wayside. Kirsch
became the program’ s all-time lead-
ing scorer and rebounder. Jennie
Vanlerberghe became the career
blocks leader.

The team then won a program-
best fifteenth game Feb. 20 over
East Tenn: St. Yet no one wanted to
talk about the record-breaking win
afterwards.

“This team has a lot of charac-
ter,” Filar explained. “They have
set some lofty goals and they want
to see them come through to the
end.”

With Saturday’s home loss to
Marshall, the Wildcats’ road to
Greensboro must now go through a
quarterfinal in Statesboro, Ga.

The strategy drawn up in Octo-
ber didn’t include travel plans for
the quarters, but the reality and hope
remains: the Wildcats are one win
away from Greensboro and three
from the NCAA’s.

“We might be more focused,”

said Filar after Saturday’s loss.

“This team seems to respond when
its back is pressed against the wall.”

O’Brien gets green light, gives Wildcats glimpse of the road ahead

Connecticut represents a
women’s basketball mecca of sorts,
one of the few places in this country
(Ruston, La., and Knoxville, Tenn.,
are a couple of prominent others)

The future

where the men’s team takes a
backseat to the women’s.

UConn went 35-0 to capture
the national title two years ago, as
Rebecca Lobo and the Huskies
thrust their sport into the national
limelight, After falling to eventual
champion Tennessee last season at
the Final Four in Charlotte, this

year’s team stands on the cusp of
perfection once again.

The Huskies (26-0) are cur-
rently the only unbeaten in Division
I basketball - men or women - and
will enternext month’s NCAA tour-
nament as a clear favorite.

Out of this bastion of talent and
fervor for the sport, coach John
Filar and his staff - renowned for
their recruiting acumen - landed
one of the state’s best in 5-foot-5
freshman guard Jen O’Brien.

O’Brien, a Middletown native
who played on all-boys teams until
the seventh grade, was tabbed
Connecticut’s player of the year
last season in leading her Mercy
Tigers to their first ever state cham-
pionship. -

She broke the 1,000-point bar-
rier just five games into her junior

year on her way to becoming the
school’s all-time leading scorer.

“Ever since I can remember,
I’ve been shooting baskets. Every-
one in my neighborhood used to
play,” O’Brien said in a recent in-
terview. “That’s all we did - get off
the bus, run into our house, get
dressed as fast as we could, then we
used to play until it got dark.”

“We knew right from the start
we had a find,” said Filar before
Saturday’s game against Marshall.
“You’ ve got to give credit to (assis-
tant coach) Jennifer Roos. Roos
sells Davidson because she loves
Davidson. She bleeds black and
red, so anytime she is recruting
somebody, they’re going to love it
too.”

O’Brien’s sky-high talent was
clear from the get-go. That was

neveraproblem. Ultimately though,
the hardest part of adjusting to the
college game for her was simply
making the decision that - despite
her relative youth and inexperience
- she had the green light to drive to
the hoop, take the oustide shot, and
make things happen on the court.

“She looked at herself as a
freshman, not supposed to be able
to score or take control of gates,”
said Filar. “But it was just a matter
of time before Jen O’Brien fit into a
role that we wanted her to.”

And once she did, Southern
Conference teams began to. get a
menacing glimpse of just what they
will have to confront in coming
years.

In the league opener Jan. 11 at
Western Carolina, O’Brien made
her first career start and responded

by notching 13 points.

A dazzlingly well-rounded
player who often appears to be in
several different places on the court
at the same time, she has been stuff-
ing the stat sheet ever since - 18
points, seven assists Jan. 20 against
Ga. Southern; 13 points, nine boards
Jan. 27 at Marshall; 18 points, eight
rebounds Feb. 1 versus Furman;
and five steals Thursday night
against East Tenn. St.

“Once she gets physically
stronger and has a full year of col-
lege ball under her belt, O’Brien’s
going to be the top point guard in
this conference,” Filar predicted, .

“She has the potential to. be

Player-of-the-Year in this confer-

ence. The ball is going to be hers
the next three years. Her potential
is really unlimited.” :
