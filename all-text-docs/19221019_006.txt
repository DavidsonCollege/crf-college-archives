MINISTERIAL BAND
HOLDS USUAL MEETING

The Ministerial Rand held its regu-
lar weekly meeting Sunday in Shearer
Hall and was addressed by Professor
Foreman; He delivered a_ stirring
heart-to-heart talk to the members and
each man came away lifted spiritually,
mentally and morally,

The song service was led by Bill
Baker and much spirit was manifested.
‘Treasurer Harry Russell presented the
budget for the coming year. It was
pointed out_that_this_budget will put
the financial department of the band
on a business basis.

Secretary Piggie Martin then made
an interesting report, telling of his ef-
forts to bring all ministerial candidates
on the campus into the band. His work
has been successful and the band is

growing rapidly each week.

TO VOLUNTEER BAND

The Volunteer Band held its regular
meeting last Sunday morning in the Y
room of the gym. Agnus McBryde,
the leader, had for his subject, “Fors
‘eign Missions.”

Various points of the work, the
need, and the opportunities were dis-
cussed by a few members of the band.
Harry Price gave an interesting talk

n “The Missionary in China.” He
told of their interesting and hard work,
yet soul-satisfying work, of their

happy by the fact that they were being
used for the Master.

DOCTOR HENDERLITE
SPEAKS AT VESPER

With Dr. J. HM. Henderlite, general
secretary of the Gastonia Y. M. C. A.,
as the speaker, last Sunday’s “Y” ves-
per service proved to be one of the
most interesting and helpful services
held this year. Basing his address on
the example of Aristides’ companion-
ship with Paul, he forcefully showed
that God does not judge men so much
by our earthly success and popularity
as by their fidelity.

His talk in brief follows:

“Aristides, one of the obscure Bible
characters is mentioned only five times
in the whole Bible, but each of these
times he is with Paul, either on the
way to Jerusalem, on the way to Rome
as a prisoner, or at other places, Tra-
dition claims that Aristides was with
Paul even at his execution. He was
the faithful boon companion of the
great Paul.

Aristides nobly stood the sternest
test of integrity of character that can
be given to man—that of remaining
faithful, though placed in an obscure
position. The man who can pass this
test will have the right views toward
himself, others and God.

“First, his being a link in the chain
of God’s eternal purpose will cause
him to rank duty as the greatest word
in the English language. Therefore he
can be depended upon, No virtue can
outshine that of a consciousness of
duty done. ‘That is the first step to-
ward greatness,

“Second, the faithful man will never
disappoint others. In this day when
co-operation is the keynote every man
must do his duty so that others will
not be hurt by his failure to do so. On
the wall of a great airplane factory are
the words, ‘A concealed, mistake may
Gost some brave man his life.’

“Lastly, the man who does his duty
does as God wants him to do. Nothing
will come short in God’s plan because
of his presence. God measures men by
fidelity. Just as Aristides was as truly
great-in-his-ptace as Paul was” itr-his,
so we can, through fildelity, have it
said of us by God, just as David said
of Jonathan, ‘They love to me was

wonderful, passing the love of
women,’ ”’ %
The service was well attended. The

music, led by Bascom Sorrels, and
assisted by Wallace Purdy at the piano,
Graham White and Crane on the violin
and George Dupree, L. B. Finn and
Thompson on cornets, was also good.
W. T. Baker presided.

DAVIDSON TEAM TO
PLAY WILMINGTON

On November 11th, Armistice Day,
the people of Wilmington will be given
the treat of seeing a Davidson football
team in action.

W. M. Shaw, ’10, has gotten to-
gether quite a’ football aggregation out
of the Wilmington Light Infantry, and
wishes to play a team of his Alma
Mater. To this end he has arranged
a game with the Wildcat scrubs.

The men making this trip will be, in
the language of Coach Grey, the Wild-
cat All-American’team, which consists
of men who are not making varsity or
Freshman trips.

There is to be quite a celebration in
Wilmington on Armistice Day and the
game is booked as a headliner,

That week the varsity plays Wofford
in Charlotte, while the Freshmen take
on N, C. State Fresh at Raleigh.
There will be three Wildcat aggrega-

tions off the Hill onjthat date and

A MERRY DRAMA
In Many Acts and Numberless
Scenes
By Ibsen Shaw Milne.

Characters: ' “Mack” Lennox, a
rather prominent senior; he prides
himself. on the nobbiness of his ward-
robe; it is his private opinion that he.is
a veritable lady-killer.

“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and a
no less prominent junior; in matters of
dress, his taste is more conservative
and substantial; in regard to his love
affairs the old adage, “Still water runs
deep,” is applicable.

Act the Fifth,
PROPHECY.

Mack—Say,—old—dear,you—should
have gone down with us last Saturday
—some game,

Bill—Quit yer kiddin’, head colds
and football games don’t go together.

Mack—And I'll. say Keith’s was
good, there was one act—

Bill—Can it, I can’t bear it.
have you there?

What

Mack—A package.

Bill—Aw ‘say, you’re a bright one,
any boob could see that it wasn’t a
five-course dinner. .

Mack—Well, you see, before we
went out to Wearn Field I dropped
around to Mellon’s and picked up a
couple o’ shirts.

Bill—Open up.

./ Mack—Aye, aye sir.

Bill—That blue stripe strikes my
fancy.

Mack—Righto — Manhattan make
and the best of Madras; and son gaze
on the:cut of the collar.

Bill—But say, I thought that whites
were still the thing?

Mack—They are, as-a-general-rule,
but Fifth Avenue says “wear a stripe
now and theh to break the monotony.”

Bill—How about that smaller
bundle?

Mack—Socks — Interwoven’s,
new silk and wool effects,

Bill—Say they’re the stuff, are they
not ?—(adv. )
