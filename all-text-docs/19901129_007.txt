“Loot,” by British playwright

Review / Movie

‘Joe Orton, is an attack on greed,

the police and many of our most
sacred institutions. The plot in-
volves bungling bank robbers, a
mysterious death and a secretive
inspector trying to recover the sto-
len loot. One review called it “a
modern Oscar Wilde drawing-
room comedy, but done in very
dark overtones,“‘ Barber said, “Al-
though the characters are very
complex, the cast and I have hada
great time rehearsing. I hope the
audience enjoys the play as much
as we have.”

Reversal Of Fortune —
Revives Citizen Kane Experience

By JOE MARIS

Citizen Kane experiences a
new revival in the film industry
with Hollywood’s latest film
mystery, Reversal of Fortune.
Based on the Claus von Bulow
trials of the early eighties, Rever-
sal of Fortune delves into this
famous case of aristocracy and
murder by paradoxically express-
ing the film’s ability to explain
“what really happened” when
Sunny von Bulow lapsed into an
apparently irreversible coma.

The film’s title and content
emerges from Alan Dershowitz’s
book with the same name. Der-
showitz, a Jewish lawyer played
by Ron Silver, accepted von Bu-
low’s case after von Bulow was
convicted of the twice i

Bulow.

Dershowitz was successful in.
overturning von Bulow’s convic-
tion. When von Bulow was ac-

quited on both counts of murder,
Dershowitz wroteReversal of For-
tune, conveying the ins and outs of
handling a big -name, big-money
case in which public opinion is
heavily biased.

Jeremy Irons, the world’s most.

underrated actor, plays the high-
browed, warped Claus von Bulow
complete with incessantly burning
cigarettes and accent slurred “I am

innocent”s.. Glenn Close narrates

the film as the comatose. Sunny
von Bulow.

This different form of narra-
tion provides this film with a deep
sense of biting irony and conde-

_scending superiority. Sunny von

Bulow challenges the audience to

‘concentrate on the film and tocome

up with the real answer to the von
ee maser). Het nmeuhety

sarcasm contrasts sharply with ir
view of Sunny lying in a tangle of
hospital tubes while nurses wash
her flaccid, paled body.

as Hal, and freshmen Todd Bow-
man as Meadows, Mike Crowley
as Dennis, Mark Little as McLeavy
and Katy McDaniel as Fay.
Barber said that the audience
will be in for a surprise when they
see the seating arrangement in
Hodson Hall. The novel configu-
ration, which will create an inti-

mate setting, means that limited .

seating is available. General ad-
mission tickets are $3 and the box
office opens on Monday, Novem-

A great source of Sunny’s
comatose amusement derives from
America’s judicial system. Sunny
posits that if man could go back in
time, courts of law would become
obsolete. As a camera pans across
the court scene in which Dershow-
itz will defend his client, Sunny’s
voice-over quips that despite the
courtroom’s inadequacies in con-
veying the truth, awe likes a

Pianist Simon To
Perform At Davidson

By CARLA WALKER

Pianist Abbey Simon, one of
the most recorded classical artists
of all time, will perform at
Davidson College on Monday,
December 3. The performance
begins at 8:15 p.m. in Hodson Hall
of the Cunningham Fine Arts
Building. Tickets for the event,

‘which is part of the college’s

Concert Series, are $4.

Music lovers and profession-
als musicians alike anticipate per-
formances by Simon, whom The
New York Times labels a “‘super-
virtuoso,” and calls “One of the
most important, exciting and mu-
sically satisfying pianists of his
generation.” Simon has also been
deemed “A spellbinder! An ex-
traordinarily gifted one!’ by The
New Yorker, the lauded as possess-
ing “marvelous, relaxedeloquence
and command” by The Times of
London.

Following his graduation from
the Curtis Institute of Music in
Philadelphia and his debut in Eu-
rope, Simon began a career that
has spanned more than four dec-
ades and has rewarded him with
various national awards. Simon
has recorded all the concerti of Ra-
chmoninoff, the complete works
of Ravel, and Schumann’ s Carna-

Marlo Cobb

val and Fantasy. He is currently in
the process of recording the com-
plete repertoire of the artist he is
most closely associated with,
Chopin.

Simon is convinced that the
solo performance remains the ulti-
mate test of any artist. “I think it is
the most illuminating thing an art-
ist can do. I was brought up in the
great tradition of the piano recital.
It’s his [an artist’s] opportunity to
show himself as whatever he is.
How else can you judge an artist,
or better yet, how can an artist
reveal himself more fully, than by
playing for an hour and a half up
there? It’s the most exhilarting
experience I know. It’s my reason
for being alive.”

Simon’s enthusiasm for his
music is shared by. Adelaide
McKelway, director of the Friends
of the Arts at Davidson and a
member of the Union Concert
Committee, which is sponsoring
Simon’s performance. She said,
“Abbey Simon is a mature artist
with avery fine, long reputation. It
is wonderful to be able to bring in
someone with his particular views
and mature artistry in contrast to
young competition winners.”
