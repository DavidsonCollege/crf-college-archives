Jerry Cole, President of the
IFC, presented the proposals
and, assisted by Jim Anderson
and Tom Parker, answered fac-
ulty questions.

The proposals that were sub-
mitted to the faculty were (1)
the IFC pledge regulation pro-
posal, (2) a statement by the
IFC Finance Committee, (3) a
list of objections to Sophomore
Rush formulated by the IFC,
(4) the existing pledge pro-
grams of nine fraternities, and
(5) a petition opposing Sopho-
more Rush signed by 521 of
732 fraternity men last spring.

The IFC pledge proposal is
the same one that was consid-
ered by the IFC on Qctober 3
and was defeated by one fra-
ternity. Since that. time the
proposal has been approved by
jall 12 fraternities and was pre-
sented to the faculty with only
one addition. that. the IFC had

proposals is to instill in the
freshmen the traditions of the
college and to give them class
unity and spirit. The commit-
tee’s plan calls for the judge
of the Court to be elected from
the senior class by the student
body; Colvin’s plan suggests
that the freshman advisor act
as judge. In the past. the judge
has been appointed by the
Student Council.

The committee suggested
that the same freshman regu-
lations as were used this year
be used next year. Colvin said
that he favored either the pres-
ent regulations or the addition

of more rules, explaining that
he “liked a firm Court of Con-
trol” and thought ‘‘an advisory
board was out of the question
and wouldn’t accomplish any-
thing.”

on the motion that the offend-
ing freshmen be contacted per- |
sonally before trial and that
the names of convicted violators
be read out in chapel was five
in favor and four against.

It was then moved to have
next year's regulations the
same as this year’s. An amend-
ment to this motion to the ef-
fect that the regulation prohib-
iting freshmen to walk on the
grass be omitted was then pro-
posed.

With this motion on the table,
the Council decided to post-
pone further discussion of the
matter until next week. Stud-
ent body president Henry Shue
gave this as a reason: “Several
members of the Council said
that some of the votes had been
close and commented that the
whole tone of the Council seem-
ed to be apathetic. It was felt
that if we're this apathetic,
maybe we should abolish the.

In the last 10 years Communism has increased notably in Latin America, partic-

Colombia is a good field for
the growth of communism,
since 45% of our people are
illiterate and even larger
percentage do not have ade-
qiate means of subsistence.
The Colombian communist
leaders are taking advantage
of this situation in order to
create uneasiness toward the
government and toward the
United States.

Mr. Nixon's
trip last year to Latin America

proved that the general feeling
of our people toward the U.S.
is not very encouraging; this
dissatisfaction is brought about
not only by communism but al-
so by certain nationalisms.

The American
which are important. to our
economic welfare. have not

been able to understand the ac-
tual problems of our countries.

We need not only private
companies but a better policy
on the part of the American
government in the field of
education, giving the oppor-’
tunity to Latin American stu-
dents to come to the U.S. “to

study the technical fields
that our development re-
quires.

The change of the American
foreign policy toward Latin
America is an emergency: if
this change does not take place
right away, the effectiveness of
the communist propaganda will
increase, and it is very likely
that the Soviet Union will in-
tervene in our affairs very
soon,

It is a matter of fact that
Latin America and Africa are
tremendously wealthy in raw
materials and may be very good
reserves for the future. The U.
S. is urged to struggle for the
development ahd growth of the
nations that make up those
parts of the world.
