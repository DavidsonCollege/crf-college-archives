“The report was meant,
for President Speneer,”’

unnamed source.”’

Board To Consider Bylaws

By DON PARMAN
Managing Editor

Just what the Davidson Col-.

lege Board of Trustees will
do next weekend at their fall
meeting is uncertain, but re-
vision of the composition of
the board itself is expected.

College president Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. said that he

‘anticipates two major topics

at .the forthcoming session,
revision of the bylaws and
a review of the social sys-
tem at Davidson.

The proposal for a revision
to the bylaws has been pre-
pared for presentation to the
trustee Executive Committee
by a special committee chair-

_ed by former trustee chair-

man Walter L. Lingle.

The recommendation, which
will be presented to the
board through the Executive
Committee, calls for a fe-
duction in size on the board
from its present 51 mem-
bers to 42. 26 of the mem-
bers would still be elécted

by the respective North Car>-

olina presbyteries with the
remaining 16 elected by the
trustees and the alumni asso-
ciation,

Spencer interpreted the ma-
jor thrust of the proposed
revision as .an attempt. to
broaden the constituency of
the board, now limited to

North Carolina Presbyterians —

and alunini.

The key change would be
the election of at-large trus-
tees by the trustees them-
selves. Spencer indicated

“ that there .would seem to

be a substantial disposition
among the trustees to include
some recent graduates among
the group of those elected at-
large.

Spencer said that there
were several different pro-
posals brought before the
special committee dealing
with the problem of repre-
sentation on the boatd by
recent graduates. He added
that the elective process was
selected because the trustees
did not want to be commnit-
ted to any person in a parti-
cular position in student af-
fairs.

“The second major area of
concern for the trustees is ex-
pected to be the Davidson
social system.

Spencer said that-he would

take a recommendation to
the Campus and Social Life
Committee concerning thé
social situation on campus,
and that he presumed that
the committee would act on
it.

Spencer added that he does
expect the trustees to ‘in-
volve themselves. in the prin-
ciples of the situation and
feels the trustees will have
mixed feelings on the frat-
ernity issue.

The Campus and Social Life
Committee is responsible for

reporting to the board on
both the social patterns and
the Code of Responsibility.

«Since the committee must
handle both of these issues,
Spencer expressed doubt that
a committee’ proposal con-
cerning the Code will | be
made to the board. He said
that he expects the Code to
be discussed by the commit-
tee, but warned that the
time necessary to discuss the
social issue may preclude suf-
ficient treatment of the is-
sues involved in the dis-
cussion of the Code.

“Putting girls in the dorms
is done as a convenience for
students,” she said, “and if
they don’t want to do it any-

|

more, we will find some
other arrangement.”

‘Burney had conferred with
college officials on the date

pus for the whole weekend

of ‘big weekends” as the
basis for campus social life.

He sald money now spent
on three “big weekends’’
could’-be better spent for a
larger number of less costly

- dances and concerts.

“This would give students
more chances to have their
dates come to Davidson,” he
said, ‘‘and would not pile
up so much activity into one
tiring overworked weekend.”

Burney indicated he would
try to have a decision on
continuing ‘‘big weekends”
made by the college finance
which is _ this
week planning the ‘student
social budget.

Mims agreed: with Burney
that money spent on “big

weekends’. could be better

spent .in another way. |

nancial Aid. Although White
has been willing to discuss
the financial aid problems
of each student individually,
many students, said Peter-
son, have had a mistrust of
the financial—aid office.

Students whose scholarships
or work - study programs
have. been cut: or who have
earned = an _ insufficient
amount during the summer
have often felt that. their. fi-
nancial awards have been
made in an unjust and ar-
bitrary manner.

Peterson urged. students
who have financial aid pro-
blems to talk to White first,
but said he would be happy
to see them if ‘‘they feel
they can establish a_ bet-
ter rapport with me.”

White is planning to hold
an’-open forum on financial
aid policies in tthe near fu-
ture. The financial aid of-
fice hopes thereby to in-
crease the student's — per-
