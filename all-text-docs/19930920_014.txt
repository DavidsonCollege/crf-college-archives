Men’ S soccer retains bragging rights against UNC-Charlotte

By Will Cobb

For all of those fairweather
fans, freshmen, preseason critics,
and peers who questioned the 1993
Davidson soccer team, the answer
was provided with a 1-0 victory
over UNCC, After seven years of
frustration, Davidson got its first
regular season win over the 49ers
on the strength of a header by Jun-
ior Jon Olin.

In front of 1,800 loud and
rowdy fansat Richardson field last
Thursday night, Davidson and
UNCC let it all hang out in a must
win situation for both teams.

Thanks to the brilliant play of
junior Neal Andrews with three
outstanding saves, the explosive
49er offense was shut out for the
first time this season. Andrews had

seven saves on the night and di-~

rected the defense effectively. His
performance shows everyone why

' hard work always pays off.

Credit is also due to the defen-
sive crew of Ed Denning, Chad
Lagerway, Tommy Suter and Rob
Malinzak. These four operated the
unique pressure zone defense to
near perfection, shutting down one
of the fastest playersin the country

in Mack Cozier. Malinzak made a
big save that prevented a goal half-
way through the second half. This
game was a good signal of the
development of the team; which
has come a long way since their
first game. Now after five games
team chemistry is there and suc-
cess should follow.

After 78 minutes of scoreless
play, Olin got the ball on the left
wing and craftily drew a foul about
two yards outside of the penalty

‘box. Suter took the kick, laying a

line drive back to Olin, who got
enough of the ball to head it just by

the near post, shaking the back net
for a 1-0 lead. The goal was his
first of the year and the timing
could not have been better. The
Cats scored again with :28 seconds
left, but the goal was taken back.
Two days later, Davidson trav-
eled to VMI for their first confer-
ence game of the season. The Cats
came out witha win in overtime by
a score of 2-1. Ben Hayes and
Ryan Northington scored for the
Cats to push their record above
.500 for the first time this year with
a record of 3-2 overall and confer-
ence record of 1-0, Neal Andrews

produced another impressive per-
formance in goal. ©

The team appears more settled
and comfortable with each player’s
position. The play of all five fresh-
men has been impressive, espe-
cially the three starters Fernando
Campos, Chad Lagerway, and
Keith Kleeman.

The next home game will bea
big one, this Wednesday against
Duke. This game will be a double
header with $200 of gifts for those
who attend both the men's and
women's games at 4:30 and 7:00
p.m. respectively.

Men's tennis
opens fall
with win

By Neil Marks

The men’stennis team opened
its fall season with a convincing 8-
1 win over Queens College last
Saturday on the Davidson courts.

The team jumped out to a 3-0
lead after doubles, led by the team
of Patrick Jopling and Bill Mitchem
in the number one spot. The teams
of Robbie Myers/Brannon Buck
and Eythan Sontag/Doug
Mackelcan were also easy win-
ners.

The Wildcats wrapped up the
match with two quick wins in
singles. Both number four seed
David Kim and number six Jason
Falzone defeated their opponents
6-0, 6-0 to give the team a decisive
5-0 advantage. Number three seed
Dan Purham and number five
David Coykendall were also
straight sets winners while number
two seed Chris Parker needed an
extra set before prevailing 6-2 in
the third.

The toughest match of the day
was in the number one position,
where Dan Grinnan dropped the
first set 6-4, came back in the sec-
ond 3-6, but fell short 6-3 in the
third.

The top two returning players
from last year, Holt Vaughn and
Russell Briggs, sat the match out to
give other players valuable match
experience.

“We try to get as many guysas
possible in matches in the fall to
give them experience,” explained
assistant coach Bryce Plott.

The fall season consists of a
few dual matches but focuses on

V-ball fights exhaustion to take 2nd

By Matt Pitzer

When the volleyball team fin-
ished offits five game victory over
Mercer Saturday, coach Carolyn
Blake said, “I think my players are
just going to lay here for. about
three hours.”

And why shouldn’t they? The
amazing come-from-behind win
over Mercer started just 20 min-
utes after the Wildcats won an
equally thrilling five-gamer over
Charleston Southern to take sec-
ond place in the Davidson Classic
tournament last weekend andcom-
pleted four-and-a-half hours of vol-
leyball.

After losing to eventual win-
ner Appalachian State in straight
sets to open the tournament,
Davidson rebounded to beat
Winthrop Friday before the two

Lady C-Country runs well

By Jean DeMoss

On Saturday, the Lady Wild-
cats traveled to Winston-Salem to
compete in the Wake Forest Invi-
tational. After previewing the
cross-country trails Friday after-
noon the runners knew exactly what
kind of course to expect.

When the gun went off at ten,
eight teams left their respective
boxes and raced towards the open-
ing in the trees. Sheltered from the
midmorning heat, the 3.1 mile
course looped through the woods.
Therunnersseta quick pace for the

first mile over the rolling trail. The
second mile proved to be an ob-
stacle and two mile splits dropped
drastically as hills cropped up on
the course. The runners regained
concentration on the third mile and
finished strong.

Carolyn Meadows led the
Wildcats followed by Phuong
Nyugen, Katie McElvie, Jean
DeMoss, and Erin Roach. The top
five finished within twenty sec-
onds of each other, and they re-
ceived water bottles for finishing
in the top 25.

matches Saturday.

“T’m really proud of the way
we played this weekend,” Blake
said. “We had two really tight
matches. Our team was really tired
and they could have let the other
team take advantage of them being
so tired, but they stepped up and
fought it off.”

With the weekend’s action,
the Wildcats improve to 8-5, in-
cluding last week’s four-game loss
to North Carolina, one of the tough-
est games on its schedule.

Against Charleston Southern,
Davidson fell behind two games to
one, after winning the first set. The
team pushed the match to a deci-
sive fifth game, before polishing
off its 16-14, 11-15, 9-15, 15-13,
15-9 win. ;

The Mercer match was even
more thrilling and unexpected.
Davidson beat Winthrop handily
on the tournament’s first day after
Winthrop defeated Mercer. Need-
less to say, the Wildcats were not
anticipating atoughchallenge from
Mercer.

Buttocallitachallenge would
be an understatement. Mercerwon
the first two games 15-13 and ap-
peared totake control of the match.
In the, first set, Davidson fougnt
back from a 14-8 deficit and closed
within one point before succumb-
ing. The second game was more
disheartening, as the Wildcats took
a 5-1 lead, but allowed Mercer to

reel off 11 of the next 13 points and
take the game.

The match turned in the third
game. Davidson held a comfort-
able lead throughout and took the
15-9 win. But the Wildcats’ mo-
mentum from that game carried
into the fourth set. Behind the
strength of Ami Bondurant’s serve,
Davidson took a quick 6-0 lead.
Mercer never had a chance in the
game, and Bondurant served out

the final three points of the 15-2 -

game.

The Wildcats started nearly as
strong in the fifth game, scoring
the first three points, but Mercer
came roaring back to take a 6-3
lead. After a time out, though, the
momentum swung back to
Davidson, which allowed Mercer
just two more pointe in the 15-8
game.

“We weren jomeane toplay
a five-setter against Charleston
Southern and then play Mercer 20
minutes later,” Blake said. “It made
our task that much tougher. The
rest factor was the biggest factor in
making the Mercer-match a five-
Setter.”

Now 13 games into the 34
game season, the Wildcats are be-
ginning to feel the effects of not
having too much depth. “I’m
stretching everybody real thin,”
Blake said. “It’s going to be a long

season. We’ve gotten pretty beat

up already.”

Cats walk all
over Rhodes

By Ed White

In its first home game of the
season, the Davidson football team
dominated Rhodes 42-12. The vic-
tory was the first for Landis as the
head coach at Davidson. On of-
fense and defense, the Wildcats
were in control most of the day.
The victory was a big boost for the
team, and evened their record at 1-
1.

The Cats were able to move
the ball well into the first quarter.
They pushed the ball to within
thirty yards of the end zone, but
were not able to find a way to
score. The first quarter ended in a
deadlock, with the score remain-
ing 0-0. :
Senior cornerback Alden
Smith was injured when he re-
turneda punt to the Rhodes 38 yard
line in the first quarter. Smith suf-
fereda fractured left ankle and will
be out for the remainder of the
season. His presence and leader-
ship will be missed.

Davidson broke the game wide
open in the second quarter. They
scored three touchdowns and went
into halftime with a 21-6 lead. Se-
nior quarterback Richard Howell
led the team in all three scoring
drives. Afterleading the team down
the field, he ran the ball in for three
touchdowns. His longest run was
his first touchdown, in which he
scored on a 30-yard run around the
right side of the line. Howell fin-
ished the day with spectacularnum-
bers. He gained 101 yards rushing
and completed 17 of 33 passes for
178 yards.

The Davidson offense did not
let up in the second half. Junior
Bruce Bannister, who rushed for
85 yards on the day, scored on a
two yard burst early in the third
quarter. Senior Kelly Shirley
scored on a ten yard pass from
Howell. Davidson closed out the
onslaught with a six yard touch-
down run by sophomore Thomas
Green late in the fourth quarter.

The Wildcat’s defense con-
tinued its impressive play from
last week, and held Rhodes to only
three first downs in the first half.
The defensive line put pressure on
