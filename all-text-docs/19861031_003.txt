Education department seeks accredidation —

By JIM DILLON

Davidson’s education depart-
ment was put on probation by the
North Carolina Department of
Public Instruction during the sum-
mer, but new education depart-
ment chairman Miriam Leiva said
the department is rectifying all
problems, and students now in the
program will receive standard cer-
tification.

The reasons Davidson ‘re-
ceived only probational approval
were primarily technicalities, ac-

' cording to Leiva. The state re-.

quires standards of admission, re-
tention and exit from the educa-
tion program. Leiva said David-
son does not have the problems
that many other schools do be-
cause those standards would gen-
erally be met by any student gain-

ing entrance to Davidson and be-

cause Davidson’s failure rate is
low.

“There were no. standards
specified by the education depart-
ment,” Leiva said. “A lot of that is
taken care of by the students’ ad-
mission. to Davidson. We admit
students to the program by ap-
proval of a teacher education com-

mittee, but the state wants
guidelines spelled out.”
Leiva said the department will

work to prepare a manual which
‘includes those-criteria before the
two year probation has ended. The
state also requires a curriculum
laboratory containing textbooks
available to potential teachers,
and until this year Davidson had
no such facility. The state further
suggested greater emphasis on the
use of computers in the class-
room. :
“There is no question about

the quality of our program,” Leiva
said. “This program was recog-
nized by the state as a outstanding
program. There are just some
logistics that have to be worked
out. We feel pretty good about it
though. We’re not rushing. °
Whenever we do it, we wantto-do—
it right. We have two years, but I
expect that we will certainly be
prepared before then.”

Leiva said she has met with
state officials to make sure her un-
derstanding of the requirements is
correct. When the changes are
completed,- Leiva will have to

_ meet with the Division of Program

Approval in Raleigh, and.a short
on site visit of 2-3 people will be

conducted. Leiva said she thinks.

the probation has positively af-
fected the teacher education pro-

~ gram at Davidson.

Twelve colleges’ join Gifts-in-Kind

By NELLE MCCORKLE ”

Company/College Gifts-In-
Kind Clearing House added 12
member colleges ‘during the past
two weeks for a total of 85.mem-
ber colleges, twice last year’s
membership.

For the first time, the clearing
house membership incorporates
independent colleges west of the
Mississippi. River, including
Lewis and Clark, Reed, Pepper-
dine, and‘Mills.

Clearing House Executive Di-
rector James Herring. attributed
the increase to his West Coast visit
this month and to clearing house
publicity in Forbes, The New York

' Times, and other national publica-
tions. The monthly American As-
sociation of Retired Persons News
Bulletin, with a 15-million circu-
lation, features a clearing house
volunteer in its November issue:

Herring. expects __ clearing
house donations’ dollar value to

double this year, from $2,000,000 .

to $4,000,000 in market-value
goods. He cited corporate tax ben-
efits as a motivating factor behind
the expected increase, but also
said, “More than two thirds of
what we get is not given for tax
reasons. A fot of the stuff — lab-
oratory equipment and furni-
ture — has no book value.””

- Convenience constitutes part
of the clearing house’s corporate
appeal, Herring said. “It would
not be worth a corporation’s time
to seek out individual colleges or
non-profit organizations that
needed a centrifuge or a freezer or
an electric. sander that the com-
pany wanted to get rid of,” he
said. “We can either make a match
with a college immediately, or
store donated ijems we think col-
leges will be needing in the near
future, or sell items with donor
permission to outside buyers and
reinvest the money in the clearing

house.”

Begun in September 1983, the
clearing house channels corporate
noncash gifts to colleges needing
those specific items. Guilford
Mills donated a textile mill and ac-
reage to the clearing house; the
funds from sale of this plant and of
other gifts not needed by colleges
pay clearing house operating ex-
penses. Atlantic Richfield and
R.J. Reynolds gave grants, but
Davidson College participates as a
‘member college rather than as the
clearing house’s sponsoring in-'
stitution.

Each member college pays
$1000. annually to participate in
ongoing bidding for donated
items. This fee provides one third
of the amount required for the
clearing house’s operation; col-
leges receiving donations pay
shipping costs.

The clearing house circulates

tems have donated video cassette
tapes on education, textbooks,
curriculum guides and other mate-
rials into the thousands of dol-
lars,” Leiva said. ‘As a result of
the request for a curriculum lab,
we have received contribtuions
from all kinds of people.”

Leiva became chairman of the
education department upon the re-
tirement of William Hight at the
end of the 85-86 year. She was a
professor of mathematics and co-
ordinator of the mathematics edu-
cation program at the University
of North Carolina at Charlotte
prior to coming to Davidson.

Leiva has a B.S. in mathema-
tics from Guilford College, an
M.A. in mathematics from UNC-
Chapel Hill and a Ph.D. in
mathematics education from
Union Graduate School. Leiva

was teacher of the year at UNCC
in 1981 and received the North
Carolina State Award for Excel-
lence in Mathematics Education
in 1983. She is currently president
of the North Carolina Council of
Teachers of Mathematics.

Leiva said the department is

‘attempting to make other changes

in the teacher education program

besides those requested by the
committee.

“We're trying to get students

_intetésted earlier in teacher educa-

tion, and that includes school
based experiences so they can find
out earlier if teaching is for them,”
Leiva said. “Through observation
and tutoring, you will find out.
We’re trying to start that kind of
preparation earlier. That is not a

result of what the state told us but

our efforts here.”

Clearing House

lists of available items; colleges
then bid on these items using a
point system. Colleges receive
points by membership and by

donating unused items; they ex- .

change these points for desired
equipment.

Herring originated the clear-
ing house idea following his ex-
perience as an Atlantic Richfield
executive. “I hated to see the
waste of things corporations can’t
use,” he said. “It was just an idea
that evolved from my own experi-
ence of seeing things wasted. No-
body wants to offend the donor.”

Asked why he chose Davidson
as the clearing house site, Herring
said, “I was living here. This
could be at any college or at no
college at all.” —

Only Davidson belonged

_when the clearing house began.
“Davidson gave us a great head
start, because it’s a highly re-

garded school,” according to oss
ring. “The other southern schools
saw it and wanted to join. I don’t
think it would have gotten off the
ground if it hadn’t been at David- —
son. As we’ve grown bigger, with
more colleges, it’s easier,” he
said.
Direct equipment benefits to
Davidson include a climate con-
_ trol laboratory, copying machine,
word processor, telephones, labo-
ratory balance and hydrometers.
Other recent gifts to the clearing
house itself are 900 35 millimeter
films and 700 pounds of érasers.

Four full-time and four part-
time and volunteer employees
work at the clearing house. Her-
ring requested student volunteer
help next’ week anticipating in-
creased calls following AARP
News Bulletin coverage. He said,
“Student volunteers will be rec-
ompensed in erasers.”

YSSC unites Davidson College with community

By LUCIA KENDALL

The YSSC is sponsoring a
community work day Saturday,
Nov. 8 from 1:30 to 4 p.m. There
are a variety of service projects
going on, including yardwork for
senior citizens, tilling a vegetable
garden at the day car center,
cleaning at the community center
for the senior lunch program, and
clearing a nature trail at Davidson
Elementary School.

At the end of the afternoon
workers will be invited to a chili
dinner at the KA house.

according to Vickie Rogers, is to
have the YSSC serve as an inter-
mediary between the between the
community and the college. “We
thought putting projects on one
day would give them special em-
phasis,” said Dan Murrey, presi-
dent of the Y-Student Service
Corps. “We wanted something
noticeable to the entire communi-
ty and to the entire campus.” Ro-~
gers added, “I think it’s a lot more
productive to get the campus as a

whole involved, rather than just

the individual houses. People get
a sense of doing something not
only with their house, but also

with the whole student body. And
with everyone doing it together I
think it'll be a lot more fun.”

Both Murrey and Rogers were
impressed with the response from
students, especially eating houses
and fraternities. “It’s really cool,”
Rogers said. “You know when
people start coming up to you ask-
ing for service projects like the Phi
Delts did, that it’s going to be
great. It seems like Patterson
Court is more service-oriented
than it has been before. I don’t

‘know why, maybe it’s just a

change in attitudes about the

}

world.” Faculty members have
also been contacted and hopefully
will be able to help out with some
of the projects.

‘Based on the enthusiasm from
the organizers and students, it
-seems likely that the community
work day will become a Davidson
tradition. Oe

“It’s an orientation that could
increase year-long involvement in’
community service,” suggested
Rogers. “Once people realize
what they can do and how much
their help is appreciated they may
want to devote more time to a par-

ticular activity. For example, the
Sig Ep’s have decided to put in a
lot of work over at the community
center. With all the things going
on on campus, the social ac-
tivities, the lecturers and people
we bring in, a lot of people tend to |
forget that there is a community
out there. This isa great way toes-
tablish contact with people in the
community.”

volved with the community ser-
vice day, contact Perry Killam at —
