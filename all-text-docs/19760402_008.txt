Lady netters boost record,
bounce by three opponents

By MARY AMOS
Staff Writer

After opening the season
with, two disappointing losses
the Girl’s Varsity Tennis
Team has now boosted their
record to an even 4-4.

They had a hectic week of
matches last week playing
Queens, Wake Forest, N.C.
State, Clemson, and U.S.C.;
yet they won three out of their
five matches.

In a match against Queens,
which had previously been
rained out, the team shut-out
their opponent by taking all
nine matches. The Queens
girls collected no more than
four games off of any set, and
accumulated no set wins.

Thursday, Wake Forest’s
strong Deacon team defeated
Davidson by a close score of
5-4. Team captain Dea Booth

FRESHMAN KIRK CAMERON vol-

displayed excellent form by
winning her number three
match 7-6, 7-5. Becca Stimson
and Andrea Murphy also
added singles victories for the
team.

In doubles action the num-
ber one team of Kirk Cameron
and Stimson split sets, yet
won their match 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.

Despite their loss, Booth
was pleased with the perfor-
mance of the team. ‘‘Wake
Forest is without a doubt one
of the stronger teams we'll
meet this year. The games
were close, and at anytime the
match could have gone either
way. Saturday we hope to
make-up for the loss when we
meet N.C. State.”

The team appeared tough on
the courts Saturday, as they
crushed N.C. State. State did
not manage a win in either the
singles or doubles matches.

Clemson 6-3.”

In Monday’s match the
team travelled to the Univer-

by a close score of 5-4,
Davidson did display a strong
effort.. Stimson remained
undefeated in singles play, by
a win of 6-4, 6-4. Sue McAvoy,
number four player, rallied
from a 4-1 deficit in the third
set to win 7-5.

Golfers fail to make cut

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor

Davidson's youny golf team
traveled to Greensville, South
Carolina last weekend for the
54 hole Furman Invitational
but failed to make the second
round cut.

Competing in a field of 33
regional teams the Wildcats
amassed a two day total of 657
strokes and did not play in
Saturday’s final round after
the field was trimmed to 24
teams.

Perennial Atlantic Coast
Conference power Wake
Forest won easily with a win-
ning marginal of over 20
strokes. In Thursday’s first
round action the Deacon’s
scores included a record tying
66 by the team captain.

“Freshmen Sollie Foy, Jim
Hurd, and Mike Kennedy as
well as Junior Craig Culbert-
son and Senior Randy Hunter
all competed for Davidson
with each day’s four low scores
being used to compute the
standings.

Foy’s first round 78 was the

only time the Wildcats were
able to break 80 during the
tournament. In the second
round Foy, Kennedy, Culbert-
son and Hunter all had identi-
cal scores of 81 for Davidson.

The field proved to be too
large for the course and 18
players did not finish their
first round on Thursday due to
darkness.

Culbertson was only able to
play 12 holes on Thursday and
had to play 24 holes the next
day. The field was cut Satur-

“It wasn’t a very tough
course. But it was a different
type of course than the one we
play on at. the Charlotte
Country Club. The greens at
Furman were not nearly as
nice as those in Charlotte,‘‘ he
said.

Davidson’s next match is
this Friday on their home
course at the Charlotte Coun-
try Club with Appa-
lachian State. Emile Parker,
who went with the Wildcats to
Furman feels the team will
fare much better this time.

‘“‘They were in danger of
missing the cut too.so we
ought to be able to compete
with them on a fairly even
level.”
