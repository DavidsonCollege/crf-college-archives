Davidson ‘Women’s Track runs strong in “Tin Can”

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL
Assistant News Editor

‘In their second indoor meet of
the season, 15 members of the
Davidson Women’s Track Team
ventured to UNC last Sunday to
race in the “Tin Can”— UNC’s
160 meter indoor track.

The competition between ap-
proximately 17 teams was not
scored. According to Beth Pucket,
Head Coach of Women’s Cross
Country/Track and Field, the meet
was one to see where they were in
terms of performances and times.

Davidson runners set new

‘school performance records
throughout the meet. By the time

‘the track had cleared, several indi-
viduals had secured many new
entries into Davidson’s Top 10
Performance Lists in events rang-
ing from long jump, tothe 55 meter

sprint, to the 800 meter run.

Impressive performances
were turned in by co-captain Lara
Burkholder, a junior who just re-
turned from a biology program of
study in Beaufort, NC. Burkholder
didn’t appear to be hindered by her
lack of training first semester, and
her performances in the long jump
(5.06), 55 (7.98), and 200 (29.54)
meter sprints, and second leg of
the 4 x 400 meter relay were all
among the 10 best in Davidson
Women’s Track history.

Jamilah Sawyer, a freshman,
was a strong competitor in the 200
meter sprint (28.85) and the 55
meter high hurdles race (8.84). She
also ran the first leg of the 4 x 400
meter relay and earned a position
in the Davidson Top 10 Perfor-
mance records in each of her events.

Co-captain Marie Grisez, a
senior, and freshman runner Rachel
Gimple ran the last two legs of the
4 x 400 relay.

In addition to the relay,

Coach Bill Drake says that each
ran a good race in the 800 meter
run.

Othertop school performances
were achieved by junior Venessa
Sims in high jump (5’2”), fresh-
man Roxy Formey in the 55 (7.98)
and 200 (29.54) meter sprints, and

Davidson men’s indoor track
and field had one of its stongest
showings in history at UNC-
Chapel Hill Jan. 28, as the young
Wildcats either challenged or
broke numerous school records.

John Leslie shattered the
school long jump mark by more
than a foot with a distance of 6.66
meters.

The sprinters also ran excep-

meter run (2:25.56). Despite an
injury to her hip, Burr’s efforts in
the 800 propelled her to a third
place finish among competitors
from Duke, UNC, and Appalachian
St. Drake says that in the 800
meter run, Burr is currently the
number two top performer of all
time at Davidson.

Men’s Track makes history in Chapel Hill

tionally well. Steve Hsieh, who
already holds the fifth fastest 300-
meter time in Davidson history,
cracked the top ten performer lists
in the 55-meter (6.90) and the 200-
meter (24.74).

Leslie (24.67), Karim
Lawrence (25.42), and Dan
Dearing (24.99) also cracked the
200-meter top ten. Earlier this
year, Dearing recorded the school’s
third fastest 300-meter time in his-
tory.
Ken Howard (2:08.83) and

The coaches didn’t seem sur-
prised by the number of outstand-
ing performances.

“I think some people that had
personal bests surprised them-
selves, but we [the coaches] sort of
have a feeling that they can do it if
they let themselves run,” Pucket
said.

David Slenzak (2:13.53) both
starred in the 800-meter, while
the men’s 4x400 relay team, made
up solely of freshmen, was dis-
qualified for dropping the baton.

The coaching staff was very
pleased with the effort of the
young team. Of the aforemen-
tioned athletes four of six are
freshmen.

The team is hoping for a
strong performance in three weeks
at the Southern Indoor Champi-
onships.

Wildcats still streaking to top conference finish

Davidson maintained its role
as Southern Conference pacesetters
this week, collecting wins over
Western Carolina Saturday (98-
85), VMI Wednesday (86-79), and
Georgia Southern Monday (71-46).

underneath, there is a good chance
you will battle with a hefty brown
or rainbow trout.

- At times of medium or high
generation, the rivers will provide
entirely new fishing situations.
Now, wading is not an option, and
many of the classic river fishing
techniques must be thrown out. If
you have access to a boat, travel to
the base of the dam and position
yourself near the edge of current
breaks. Many large fish hold in the
calm water and dart into the faster
water to grab helpless victims. In
fact, if big fish are your fancy,
there is no better place to tie into
one than right behind the dam.

The Wildcats secured six votes
in this week’s USA ,Today/CNN
Coaches’ Poll and were ranked as
high as 42 in the Sagarin computer
ratings.

Davidson also skyrocketed to

fourth in the nation in scoring mar-
gin (19.6) and 12th in scoring out-
put (86.4). But this busy week
served as a bona fide test for
Davidson. Western Carolina and
VMI proved worthy opponents
before ultimately stumbling late in
the second half, as smart play
coupled with superior free throw
shooting enabled Davidson to pre-
vail.
Small baitfish are sucked through
the top of the dam and shot out at
the bottom, so catfish, trout and
stripers lay at the bottom with
mouths open for an easy meal.
Stripers as large as thirty pounds
are caught regularly, and catfish as
big as Volkswagens have scared
many a scuba diver to the surface.
If you want to tangle with one of
these catfish, hook a piece of cut
‘bait to a stout rod and fish during
maximum generation.

‘Although some of the rivers
will never be seen in their natural
state again, we can still enjoy what
they have to offer. Dams can pro-
vide year round action for all types
of anglers because of the many
conditions and water levels. The
many different conditions also pro-
vide the opporitunity to catch a
mixed bag of fish as well..
guzzle beer, and lose vast amounts
of money? This realization might
explain why these festivities prac-

tically symbolize an American:

holiday.

Finally, I leave you with food
for thought. Davidson hoops bet-
tered UNC-Charlotte earlier this
year by 9 points. UNCC only lost
by 2 to Memphis who only lost by
3 to the aforementioned Minute-

men. Therefore, by way of a little’

quick math, Davidson is 4 points
better than the top-ranked team in
the country. Think about it. An
believe. ;

Before a crowd of 1,940 Sat-
urday in frigid Cullowhee, the Cata-
mounts held a 32-25 advantage
with 7:08 left in the first half and
were down only four with 10 min-
utes remaining. But a 17-8 spurt in
the final 6:24 and 82.4% free throw
proficiency on the evening gave
the Wildcats their seventh confer-
ence conquest in as many tries.

Narcisse Ewodo had perhaps
his finest all-around game at
Davidson, recording career bests
in points (21) and assists (6), while
grabbing eight rebounds. Brandon
Williams tallied 25 points and nine
boards, both game highs. Quinn
Harwood (10 points), Chris Alpert

(14), and Ray Minlend (11) also
reached double figures.

VMI gave Davidson its big-
gest conference scare thus far, hold-
ing a one-point lead with 4:51 left.
But a Minlend jam ignited an 11-3
game-ending run, and the Wild-
cats escaped with the 7-point tri-
umph over the Keydets.

(Tonight) showed that we can
execute in tough situations. And
that’s something we didn’t do well
last year, so we’re proud that we
did hang on and win this game.”
Williams said of the nailbiter.

(8), and Ewodo (7) all bolstered
the balanced Wildcat scoring as-
sault.

The Davidson-Georgia South-
ern matchup, pitting the
conference’ s bestand worst squads,
initially looked to be a stark mis-
match. Yet heavily favored
Davidson struggled during the first
20 minutes, and the Eagles held a
32-23 edge at intermission. But in
the second half the Wildcats over-
whelmed the Eagles, 48-14. Said
McKillop, “We had one half to-
night. I think Georgia Southern
had something todo with that. They
outfought us, outworked us. (To-
night) was a wakeup call.”
