SELECT OFFICERS

At a meeting of the Freshman class
Monday morning following a called
meeting of the student council, Jim
Hendrix, president of the Student
3ody, notified the Freshmen that soon
they would be allowed to select their
class officers,

Hendrix said that one morning this
week the Freshmen would vote for ,
their class president, vice-president,
secretary and treasurer, historian and
poet. He spoke of the importance oi
considering this matter before going
into it.

Several prominent leaders of the

student council for each office, but the

We are not discussing those students who

and at other times there are large crowds of
boys who yell at the: cars Durham bound.
One professor says that he was yelled at no
less than three times between the corner of
Columbia Avenue and the post office. He
was not going to Durham and had his car
filled with children, To hail a car that is
filled seems to us to be very illogical on the

Strangers or visitors to the community do
