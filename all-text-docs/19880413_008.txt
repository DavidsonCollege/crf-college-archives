Dry rush: another ridiculous idea

By BILL SCOUTEN

With fluff, triteness, and dia-
tribe, I return to uncover yet an-
other ridiculous idea in the mak
ing.

Dry-rush.

Let’s think about it for a mo-
ment.

What does this concept entail?
Is it workable? I think not. In fact,
the notion may be a ludicrous one
given the “self-selection” system
of Davidson.

Davidson distinguishes itself
from other colleges and universi-
ties, refusing to acknowledge the
Greek system of bid-giving. Self-
selection precludes the notion of
“rush.” The distinction of
Davidson’s “non-

gether an enjoy one another’s
company. Certainly parties help
to sway many to or away from
one’s house. But, as one who has
gone through the rushing process,
I feel qualified in saying that men
and women choose to join a house
not for its alcohol, but for its
people.

The human dimension of the
choice to join a house may, in fact,
be basic enough to undermine any
dry-rush advocate’s argument. A
final idea, however, which relates
to the former is the notion of alco-
hol as a “rush-tool.”

Alcohol is not used as a “rush-
tool,” per se but is used to facili-
tate enjoyment. If one does not

wish to drink, he need not. Noone
is forced to drink—and, if peer
pressure is the villain that scares
you, I suggest that it be overcome.
In many ‘ways, then, alcohol
helps one to develop an identity,
strengthen a person by allowing
him to say “No,” by allowing him
to learn to control his inhibitions.
Alcohol may be an evil, but evil
must be confronted and con-
trolled, not ignored.
- The idea of dry-rush, therefore,
may simply be a fabrication of
fluff and triteness designed to
distinguish Davidson College

from other schools, simply a tape °

and plaster job covering a policy
gone bad.

rush” | status, how-
ever, is another area
to be illumined.

Overlooking the
minor semantic diffi-
culty of “rush,” one
may define the rush
period of Davidson
as an extended pe-
riod of approxi-
mately ten weeks of
which the first four
see no freshmen on
Patterson Court.

During the first
four weeks, despite
the administrative
desire, rush undenia-
bly occurs.

Rush is a personal
interaction between
members of houses
and freshmen during
the first four weeks of
fall term. Such inter-
action takes place on
the hall, at Union
events, during flick-
erball tourneys, etc.
In such environ-
ments, the idea of
alcohol may or may
not exist. Usually,
though, hall visita-
tions and flickerball
games do not involve
any sort of alcohol
related activity.

Thus, the early
weeks of school see
many forms of stu-
dent interactions that
do not involve alco-
hol. Of course, this is
not to say that stu-
dents do not drink
during the first few
weeks of the term --..
certainly this is
naivete! However, it
is not wrong to say
that the personal
communication of
upperclassmen and
freshmen provides a

_ bond of friendship.

Rushing is not
complete. without the
party -- a time for
may to come to-
