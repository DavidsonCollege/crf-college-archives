The “¥" Committee on Christian
Activities reports an increase of 12
1-2 per cent in the total attendance
at the Sunday Schools last Sunday
afternoon, The 29 fellows who
went out to teach seem to enjoy
their work quite a bit and are anx-
ious to add to the total attendance
of their schools.

The following attendance was re-

Brawley's 42 present, 5 teachers.

Caldwell 65 present, 6 teachers.

Cornelius 76 present, 5 teachers.

Mill 40 present, 3 teachers.

Strike.”

The Chinese students have very
highly trained minds and they all
learn with extraordinary case and
swiftness... The Mission Schools are
very highly esteemed not only by
the students themselves, but by the

Chinese showed themselves even
more willing to co-operate than the

“China” said the speaker, “will
soon be one of the most important
nations on the globe. It is impera-
tive that we do everything in our
pewer to influence her for good
while the change is still going on.”
Many Davidson men, he said, should
“come out to this land of great op-|
portunity and help in the great
work.” ,
