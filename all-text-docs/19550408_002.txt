P. A.’s Platform

The week has seen Perrin Anderson,
most active in the group which originated
and hashed out the new constitution,
elected by the Student Body as its Presi-
dent. Certainly there is no one more
qualified by experience with student gov-
ernment than is Anderson, who has been
on the Student Council since his fresh-
man year, and who was Second Vice-
President of the student body this year.

Anderson’s campaign speech consisted
of four main points, all of which are ad-
mirable:

I. He promised to rend the veil of
secrecy which surrounded the Student
Council in the past by publishing, inso-
far as is allowable, reports of its activities
and trials. We hope that the qualification
will not prove to be a strict limitation. We
would like to make one suggestion that
he might ponder as he organizes his plans,
this being that the Davidsonian have a re-
porter, preferably a member of the Coun-
cil, present at each council meeting to re-
port procedure. Of course it should be
understood that this reporter cléar all
facts for publication through the Presi-
dent.

Il. He plans to remold the Council
from a purely judicial organization to an
organization actively participating in cam-
pus life, supporting such functions as
1) returning the Court of Control to
chapel, 2) renovating the Village so that
it may be used as apartment space for
married students, 3) giving the freshmen
the facts concerning exemptions and obli-
gations involved in ROTC before they get
hooked, and 4) investigating the attitudes
of some of the departments regarding
the principles of the new cut system.

We wholly support him in his efforts
to give the Student Council an active place
in constructive campus life. As to the
specifics mentioned, abolishing the Court
of Control] altogether wouldn’t be a bad
idea, but our traditional value pattern
would prohibit such heresy. Certainly
the Village needs to be renovated, or pre-
ferably, destroyed and replaced by some-
thing that looks and is permanent. The
ROTC situation should be explained fully
to incoming freshmen, but we suspect that
if it ever is, the Department will simply
remove all exemptions incurred by letters
from the parents. Anderson should con-
sider what his next step would be after
this. As for overcutting, the attitude of
the ROTC has been especially obnoxious
in interpreting the new system, since
whether or not they followed the princi-
ple involved in’the philosophy of the sys-
tem is questionable. But the student re-
action to the system so far—extreme
overcutting—is also questionable in light
of student responsibility. The new Presi-
dent may hit a snag here.

OI. Anderson came out against non-
subsidized athletics. We feel with the ad-
ministration that the money could be put
to better use, and that such use would not
increase the “femininity rate” at David-
son. Do you gotta be a football player to
be a man?

IV. He has stated that in student gov-
ernment he will strive to uphold the (new)
constitution. We hope so. That’s what it’s
for.

The new President would do well to
heed a point that Jason McManus brought
out in his campaign speech, that being
the necessity of better-student trustee
communication. If students and faculty
and students and trustees could meet on
equal levels to discuss college affairs, the
attitude of both sides would probably im-
prove. Anderson should consider ways—
limited student representatives to Trus-
tee or faculty meetings, ete—in which

this can be done. If he doesn’t he’s in for
trouble,

And he should consider also, in begin-
ning his tenure of office, the words of
Emerson as used by Hobby Cobb in his
campaign speech: “The thing done pre-
vails, not what is said about it.”

Y Deficit

A deficit from three to four hun-
dred dollars faces the YMCA this year
unless vesper offerings show a marked
upswing in the few weeks before com-
mencement. According to Treasurer Cor-
tez Cooper, the YMCA budget allowed for
$2600 from student donations this year
at vespers, this figure being determined
from last year’s actual net. To date, how-
ever, only about $1900 has been collected
at vespers, and the present rate of about
$55 a week will give us in the end at best
about $2300 of the $2600 needed in the
budget.

The ‘prolific pennies in the offering
plates each Sunday, and the student idio-
synerasy involved in passing the plates
upside down for the first few rows (until
some fool pre-min loosens up) show why
vesper offerings have been so poor lately.
But the deeper question involved in the
attitudes of the student in his refusal to
give in support of the YMCA shows an
unjust antagonism or lack of concern for
one of the most active organizations for
student welfare that Davidson possesses.

At Davidson the YMCA is primarily a
student organization and wholly an or-
ganization of service. It is the active
YMCA that brings forums, supports dis-
cussion and study groups, brings excellent
speakers to unrequired services, and does
numerous other things for the students.
And an active YMCA needs active student
participation. One of our greatest respon-
sibilities in student participation is to sup-
port it with the money we have. Steward-
ship is an important word to the Christian,
and a failure on the part of the Christian
to be a worthy steward is a failure on his
part to witness for his belief.

Other Deficits

In considering stewardship, it would
be interesting to compare the mountains
of gold spent by most students on such
things as cars and flicks with the amount
these same students clank into benevo-
lences such as Christmas Seals, the March
of Dimes, heart and cancer funds, etc.
All these things seem of little importance
to us now for no great number of stu-
dents are taken by cancer or heart at-
tacks, and few of us have had infantile
paralysis or contracted TB.

This seems to be a reflection of one of
the main attitudes on the part of our
student generation, however, a concen-
tration on the trivialities which make us
“big deals” in our crowd and socially ac-
ceptable to the whole of our limited
group, paralleling a deep unconcern for
everybody and everything outside of our
academic world. Nothing outside of our-
selves is really important anymore—is
it?

Thumbs Up To UCM

Preliminary reports on the UCM
evaluation program show that the great
majority of the students questioned in the
evaluation showed desire to have another
Mission next year. The reports also
showed that Harry Smith and Waldo
Beach were the most popular speakers
as chosen by a group of. something less
than 100 students questioned. In the
questions on the emphases of the week,
race relations, labor and politics, students
showed a narrow preference for integra-
tion, no labor union, and no governors
named Miller.

The reports so far are only prelimi-
nary, being a compilation of some two-
thirds of the total number returned. One
major trend has shown itself in students
who voiced their opinions as to what we
should have next year: they are asking
for a more evangelical approach, the
meaning of Christ in the individual's
search for his Maker, emphasis on a Chris-
tianity which we do not hear very much
anymore.

What ought we to do? Which way shall
we turn to save our lives and the future
of the world? It does not matter so much
to old people. They are going soon any-
way. But I find it poignant to look at
youth in all its activities and ardor, and
most of all to watch little children play-
ing their merry games, and wonder what
would lie before them if God wearied of
mankind.—Winston Churchill, March 2,
1955.

Platform Of Candidates For Davidsonian Editorship

e
Maurice Crouse
Editing a student newspaper is
both a great challenge and a great
responsibility — responsibility to
see that news is presented fully
and impartially and that editorial
policy is genuinely constructive,
and a challenge to live up to the
requirements of that responsi-
bility.

The brief outline given below
is a sketch of the general policy

which the Da-
- vidsenten would
;& " « follow during
" the next year,
; should the stu-
\ 1 dent body elect
me to the posi-

‘ tion of editor.
‘ A major criti-
cism of the De
Zz & A vidsonion in the
-_ past is thot it
Creuse has neglected
some areas of campus life and
activities. This is almost inevita-
ble on a campus with such varied
activities as ours, for the editors
cannot be fully informed of every-
thing that has happened or is

going to happen.

There is a solution, however.
Each organization on the campus
would be asked by the Davidsonian
to designate some person, proba-
bly the secretary, to notify the
newspaper of any important events
and perhaps be responsible for
contributing articles. Liason be-
tween the organizations and the
newspaper would be greatly sim-
plified, and such o system would
result in a wider coverage of
news.

No less important than contact
between students is communica-
tion between students and the col-
lege itself, including the faculty,
the administration, and the trus-
tees. Lack of adequate contact is
apparent, although this year has
been somewhat better than others.
One example is the spreading via
the grapevine of the increase in
tuition and college fees for some
time before the official announce-
ment. Occasionally we read ‘in
other newspapers of events at Da-
vidson of which students have not
been informed. The Oavidsonian
can be an important means of com-
munication in this respect, and it
would be its policy to promote bet-
ter relations and the flow of in-
formation.

In keeping with this policy, the
motto of the Davidsonien, “The
news and editorial voice of David-
son College” implies that not only
students but the faculty and ad-
ministration will be able to make
themselves heard. College officials
will be asked from time to time
to present their views on current
issues through the columns of the
newspaper.

The Davidsonian has a legitimate
function es a bulletin board for

coming events, and it will continue
to be used for that purpose. It
should be more than this, however:
important speeches and happen-
ings should be covered by follow-
up articles as well as announce-
ments.

Although polls are at best only
significant of the drift of student
opinion and by no means infalli-
ble, the student body will be polled
frequently on important issues,
such as the holiday question, in
order to provide the editor and
the faculty with some basis for
comment and action.

Davidson College has rather just.
ly been styled “provincial” by
thoughtful persons on this campus
and at other schools. We are prone
to think that our little problems
and inconveniences are the only
ones. It will be an important
function of the Oavidsonian to
present the students with varied
comments on issues which are
broader than this campus alone.
This would be done by campus con-
tributions and by clippings from
other newspapers, particularly the
collegiate ones.

It is an obvious obligation of
the student newspaper to strive to
improve the college as a whole,
Through its editorial columns, it
can examine both official and un-
official actions of the college fam-
tly and suggest relevant changes
or reconsiderations. Such examina-
tions would extend to the question
of modernization of the college
plant, especially the dormitories
and the library, revisions of and
additions to the curriculum to pro-
vide greater flexibility in the
choice of courses, and appraisal of
the athletic policy to see if it can
be brought into harmony with the
educational aims of the college.

If elected, 1 would strive to
achieve these goals. If another
candidate is chosen, I pledge him.
my full support in making a better
Davidsonian “for a better David-
son.”

Dick Morehead

Many will agree that this year’s
Davidsonien is the best published
here in their collegiate careers.
Great strides have been taken in
style, composition, and novel in-

novations. This

should bé only

l the beginning.

‘ Greater strides

must be made

to increase the

power, quality,

and _ inclusive.

ness of this, the

student voice. It

is with this in

mind that I pre-

sent the follow-

ing program for your inspegtion,
deliberation, and decision.

Complete and impartial campus
news coverage. To eliminate

Morehead

monopoly of columns by one as-
pect of campus life (Sgt. Sketches,
scholarship scrolls, Nosmo King,
etc.), represent each organization
with relative equality, and avoid
inclusion of the “leavings” of
other papers, there is a need for
complete and impartial news
coverage.

This can be done by an organ-
ized and expanded staff. Reporters
should come from two sources:
one, from the organizations of
which they are a part; and two,
from an enlarged group of write-
ers. Each organ of campus life
would thus be represented on the
paper.

Alert and influential channel of
expression for administration end
student body. There has been a
definite need for such an informa-
tive thoroughfare to get behind
the “Slick” curtain, reveal the
facts and contemplated actions,
and reduce articles based upon
assumed knowledge.

Progressive steps can be taken
in this direction by: 1) bi-monthly
meetings of the editorial staff with
Dean Spencer to discuss changes,
present student opinion, and
secure administrative information
and views;

2) a question and answer pro-
gram — students would submit
questions to be answered by quali-
fied faculty members, the re-
sults being printed weekly;

3) feature articles concerning
subjects such as college endow-
ment, rooming arrangements, and
tuition about which little is known
but much is spread;

4) alert and accurate coverage
of trustees and administrative
meetings on subjects of importance
to the student body.

A planned and directed editorial
policy. Improvements have been
made but much is needed on the
“voice” page to remove the trite,
and to project ideas with purpose,
practicality, and power. The fol-
lowing are proposed.

1) an editorial board meeting
each week to plan and organize
long range procedure, obtain.
qualified writers, and select the
best and most pertinent material
submitted.

2) to reduce columns controlled
by “galloping isms,” an enlarged
and rotated editorial group extend-
ing outside of the journalistic few
to include all factions in the stu-
dent body.

3) to widen our horizons, a single
weekly column devoted to intelli-
gent discussion of local, national,
or world events by students who
are qualified, capable, and_ in-
terested.

4) to improve hit-and-run edi-
torial procedure, the  editor’s
column devoted in part to con-
certed, recurrent articles on be-
half of student views as de-
termined by opinion polls and per-
sonal contacts.

A more dynamic end eppealing
front page presented through use
of imaginative pictures, double
headlines, and other media with
the emphasis upon flexibility and
orginality.

An activities directory. A brief
but inclusive schedule of the
week’s activities and events spread
through coordination with Hon-
orary Fraternity Council, sports
department, “the Hill,” and or-
ganizational leaders.

Complete end equal represente-
tion in sports through assigned re-
porters being responsible for a
sport during its season with the
emphasis upon school pride.

instillation of intended humer
through: one, reinstatement of a
weekly cartoon; and two, a bi-
monthly feature devoted to a com-
pletely humorous treatment of
various aspects of college life and
the student body.

Complete coordination with our
elected leaders. Through editorials
and a student government column
to back President Anderson and
Council on such proposals as sub-
sidization of athletics, open coun-
cil meetings, and corrected calen-
dar, with which this writer is in
complete agreement.

Tom Warlick

This is the time of year when
those who would aspire to*become
editor of the Davidsonien must
pause and consider what is the
function of a student newspaper in
a college society. Three areas
stand out which must be the con-
cern of the college newspaper, the
gathering and dissemination of
news, the analysis of the news
(editorials), and features.

The- first of these, implied by
the very name
newspaper, is
the most im.
portant.The edi-
tor must insure
through his
staff that news
of the sdminis-
tration, student
government, and

. other campus

organizations is

Warlick thoroughly,com-

pletely, and impartially reported
to the reader.

However, the editorial function
is of great importance. Every con-
troversial question, such as ath.
letic subsidization and segregation,
which is of concern to the David-
son family, should be thoroughly
analyzed, giving adequate opportu-
nity for the presentation of each
side. Nevertheless, the Davidsonien
must not be led, it must lead.

Features entertain and enlighten
the reader, holding a vital place in
the college newspaper. An espe-
claily valuable feature, polls con-
ducted periodically, helps to ascer-
tain the true feeling of the stu-

dent body.

The Davidsenien can be of in-
estimable value in improving two
areas of controversy on the campus
today. The first is in the student.
faculty and administration rela-
tionship which reached a peak of
hostility late last spring. Follow.
ing determined action by Dr. Cun-
ningham the situation has been
gradually improved. The Davidse.
alan can play a big part in improv-
ing this relationship. This
does not infer that the newspaper
should be a tool of the faculty,
for oftentimes criticism of faculty
decisions is justified, but that
through proper presentation of
student ideas to the faculty and
faculty proposals to the students,
policies may be adopted whose sup-
port the Davidsonisn can heartily
recommend. Indeed it would seem
wise to use again the motto which
the Davidsenien bore for 38 years,
“For a better Davidson.”

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

The second is the student-student
government relationship. The stu.
dent government should be made
acquainted with the feeling of the
student body and should be en-
couraged to act accordingly, and.
the student body should be made
to feef that their representatives
are working for their interests.

. This is the function of the David.

sonian.

I would co-operate wholehearted-
ly with the newly elected Presi-
dent of the Student Body in print-
ing Student Council activities as
far as was prudent to fulfill this
plank in his platform.

SPORTS COVERAGE

1 advocate reorganization and
integration of the Davidsonisn
staff,-This is especially true of the
sports department, which, due to
a lack of organization and a dearth
of sports writers, has become
jargely a one man operation, re-
sulting in a great strain on the
printing and circulation depart-
ments as well as the Sports Editor.
This is no reftection on the present
Sports Editor who has done a
splendid job under the circum.
stances. The minimum additions
needed by the sports staff are an
assignments man and several good
freshman writers. I favor increased
sports coverage, including the re-
turn of such interesting features
as “Wildcat of the Week.”

Your editor this year has
stressed layout, appearance, and
accuracy. I would strive to main-
tain the standards thus set and
to improve them if possible. 1
would put greater stress on news
evaluation and editorial selectivity.
- In closing I would like to say

‘that I would consider my election

the greatest honor I have ever re-
ceived, and that if elected I would
pledge whatever talents I may have
to making the Daevideenion the
most potent force for progress on
the Davidson campus.

Platform of Candidates for Quips and Cranks Editorship

DeWitt Helm, Jr.

A faculty member recently com-
mented that the Class of 1956 is
the most promising class to enter
Davidson in thirty years. Thus, a
twofold challenge is ours. The
1956 Quipe and Crenks must sur-
pass the high standards established
by preceding classes and provide

insurmountable challenge to
classes of the future.

“Anything to be different,” is
a poor mottot Retrogression,
whether by us or by our children,
can be ‘ facili-
tated by por-
traying events
of the 1956
school year in
chron ological
order with a par-
allelism in copy
and pictorial
re presentation.
Quality can be
attained through
originality, read-
ability, durability, attractiveness,
and thorough representation.

My personal feeling is that our
challenge can be met only through
efficient staff coordination.  Cll-
quishness must be evoided through
impartial staff representation irre-
spective of social affiliation. Now,
April, is the time to begin working
and last wfnute confusion that re-
sults in poor quality and inferior
workmanship can be alleviated.
The Student Body must be
thoroughly solicited to obtain ca-
pable, interested students, and the
quality of the Quips end Cranks
improved from a long range view
by a similar solicitation of incom-
ing students during Orientation
this fall. Staff spirit can be at-
tained through intercollegiate
competition. As the annual evolves
the Student Body can be kept in-

formed of progress “through the
Oavidsonian and student opinion
will be valued in periodic judg-
ment. Biweekly staff meetings will
promote coordination and facili-
tate a review of progress, imme-
diate requirements, and student
opinion.

“Breathing space” is a prerequi-
site for readability. Enlargement is
entailed, but quantity must be con-
sistent with quality. An efficient
business staff can obtain more ad-

.vertisements and thus quality can

be paralleled with quantity. Con-
sistency and accuracy in copy, an
equilibrium between copy and pic-
tures, and attractive print will as-
sure readability of our annual from
cover to cover.

A durable and original cover, 3
primary and secondary color
scheme, superior art work and
color photography will contribute
to the esthetic value and continu-
ity of our publication. The quality
of individual portraits must be im-
proved. If this can not be achieved
through the present studio, a
change is expedient.

Impartial student representation
ean be increased through informal
pictures portraying every aspect of
student life and careful selection
will assure there is no vain repeti-
tion of student demagogues or
members of any social organiza-
tion. The respective sections of
our annual must be thorough and
include al] the members of every
student group, social, honorary,
and independent.

The 1956 Quips and Cranks is
your annual. Vital decisions such
as the dedication should be de
termined by a ballot of the rising
Senior Class. You are further en-
titled to a competent and impartial
beauty judge and a Student Body
‘Directory giving the name, class
and address of every student.

Most of our non-academic time
is centered around our social or-
ganizations. This section merits
enlargement and improvement
through informal pictures and
copy dealing with our respective
activities rather than vague “mis-
cellaneous chit-chat.” Confusion
and discrepancy can be avoided by
selecting competent representa-
tives from each respective organ-
ization and making them responsi-
ble for the material in this section.

During three years on the Quips
and Cranks’ staff I have observed
that the quality of this publica-
tion is largely determined by the
time and effort the editor ex-
pends. If elected, I solemnly
promise to dedicate my. untiring
effort, dogged determination, and
unflinching critique to the pre-
sentation of an original, readable,
durable, attractive, and thorough-
ly representative portrayal of the
1955-1956 school year. Regardless
of your decision, I shall always
consider it an honor to have been
considered for this responsibility
and. my interest will be in helping
the Class of 1986 meet its twofold
challenge.

Jim Marshall

All aspiring young editors are
infested with changing the world
of publications with “their” crea-
tion. If and when elected, they
realize sooner or later that one
does not put out Fortune without
a fortune, and, unfortunately,
the Quips and Cranks won't have
a fortune at its disposal. There-
fore, I took a long look at the
budget to temper my dreams of
color photography, fold-out pages,
and other fantasies. The following.
represents what didn’t get re-
pressed or suppresed after realisti-

cally analyzing the budget.

To carry the analogy between
magazines and annuals a little
further, I conceive the perfect an-
nual to be a synthesis of Helidey-
like photography and New Yorker-
type prose. A legitimate question
is how can this be achieved.

The field of modern photography
offers us a wealth of techniques
which can and should be utilized
in our annual. Individual pictures
are admittedly as static as the blue
coats and ties which we wear for
these pictures. “Live” photography,
however, is the result of nothing
but good planning.

Each picture should be a study and

convey a defi-
f nite impression.
While each pic-
i ture must be
unique, every
- picture should
‘ contribute to
the dynamic or-
ganization of
_ the book. There-
fore, the editor
must conceive
of each pic
ture even before it is taken and
perceive its relationship to the en-
tire work. Because this is a role
of the editor, he of necessity sets
the limits within which the photog-
raphers work.

Planning and organization are
virtues which an editor must de-
velop. These are commodities
which no budget can buy. Rather
tehy are the commodities which
determine how well the budget is
used.

The copy in the annual is the
other vital area where this over-
all conception is essential. In the
past many of our annuals have suf-
fered from an anemic prose which
is as sterile as stainless steel. Most
editors recognize stilted and dull

Marshall

copy; they excuse it by saying that
no one reads it anyway. Yet,
eventually most of us do (or shall)
read some of the copy.

Ignoring the fact that as alumni
the copy as well as the pictures
will be a source of reminiscences,
the prose in the annual, and, -in-
cidentally, poetry isn’t taboo,
should be written in afresh and
casual style which give new in-

, sights into the Davidson scene.

This would necessitate attracting
the best writers on the campus to
contribute to the most permanent
publication. No longer would copy
be randomly handed out to staff
members with the only instructions
being a deadline.

As I intimated by the reference
to the New Yorker, I feel that this
style of writing would accent the
annual throughout with the
sophistication and exclusiveness
which is Davidson (at her best).
This writing would be highly en-
tertaining and rewarding: the
risque, but never the bawdy; the
humorous, but never the ludicrous.

I should try to biend the pic
tures and prose into subtle and
symbolic meanings. The end prod-
uct would have that “Tailored
Look”—an important quality in a
self-respecting person or annual.
True, the “Tailored Look” may be
expensive-looking, but I believe
that I am capable of achieving this
by utilizing campus resources
which ere available—intelligence,
discrimination, style, and origin-
tally. These qualities, often latent
or ignored in our past annuals, are
not dependent upon our budget.
By exploiting them we will replace
the classical annual with a classy
annual. With nothing less would J
be satisfied.
