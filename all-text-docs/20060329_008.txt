Theater department placed on academic probation

Last Sunday, the theater depart-
ment was placed on academic pro-
bation and kicked off campus until
the beginning of the Fall 2007
semester.

The suspension was
due to the depart-
ment’s failure to abide
by college rules regard-
ing the deadline for
play rehearsals. ~The
department held
rehearsals a full week
past the — school’s
imposed deadline.

“The school’s policy
regarding play
rehearsal is very clear,”
said Associate Dean of |
Students Lisa Mertz.
“Play rehearsal is not
to continue after the
designated play
rehearsal-week. Play
rehearsal’ is a time-
consuming event,
especially for new
freshmen and can sig-
nificantly hinder aca-
demic pursuits.”

The mother of one of
the freshman students
who joined the play
tipped off the adminis-
tration to the illegal rehearsals.

The student told his mother
about the many difficult and time-
consuming scenes he was forced to

rehearse for the play. The mother
was concerned that her son was
failing as a result.

The students were rehearsing

the play ‘Karma Alphabets’, which
explored themes of divine justice
and language. It involved several
stressful and time-consuming

scenes. One scene involved a long
swim in Lake Norman.’ Another
scene involved the forced drinking
of fraternity pledges.

“One of the
most _ stressful
scenes involved
several members
of the play hurl-
ing hard objects
at other play
members’
heads,” said cast
member’ Byron
Kingston ’07.

Although no
one from the the-
ater department
denied that
rehearsal went
, on after the
school-imposed
deadline, some
question the
stringency of the
school’s
response.

“IT don’t see
what the big deal
is,” said’ Ned
Branchwood ’08.
“So what if we
rehearsed after
the play was
over? Everyone wanted to keep
rehearsing. We were really starting
to bond, and no one cared that it
was such a big time commitment.”

HUMOR . WEDNESDAY, eae 29, 2006

Other members of the yheater
department have accused the
administration of using unethical
methods to extract information
about play rehearsals from newly
declared theater majors.

“All departments go beyond
school deadlines. Singling out the
theatre department like this is
ridiculous, and it’s unfair to all the
theatre majors who have put in so
much time,” said Theater
Professor Brent Carter.

“The real losers here, of course,

“Not only did the
students have to go.
through all that
extra play rehearsal,
but now they don’t
get credit for it.”

are the theater majors,” said Sarah
Ronk ’06. “Not only did the stu-
dents have to go through all that
extra play rehearsal, but now they
don’t even get credit for it. They'll
have to find a new major and
spend all that time to accrue
enough credits to complete that
major if they want to have a
degree.”

Sophomore to begin accepting roommate applications

With housing lottery just around
the corner, Danny Williams ’08
announced to inquiring friends
and acquaintances that he will be
accepting roommate applications
for next year.

Williams, who has the best lot-
tery number in the sophomore
class, is seeking a roommate based
on applicant traits like dorm pref-.
erence, lifestyle habits and the size
of his DVD collection.

Applicants with girlfriends or
who plan on going abroad will be
disqualified immediately.

“Basically, if you want the
chance to live in some of the most
desirable rooms on campus, you’re
going to have to go through me,”
said Williams. “I have the best lot-
tery number, and I am a pretty
cool guy to live with, so I knew that
competition for my roommate
services would be intense. I decid-
ed on an application process
because it should keep the process
orderly and avoid a mad rush.
Also, it preserves my right to pick
the best roommate available.”

Williams’ roommate application
is'a 49-page document that calls
for responses in true/false, multi-
ple choice and short essay formats.

Questions range from favorite
types of music and movies to more
personal queries regarding show-
ering habits and views on being

sexiled.

Williams believes the length of
the application will help to deter
less serious candidates.

“Right now I’m spending most
of my time grading DVD collec-
tions because I’ve really gotten sick
of most of my own movies,” said
Williams. “I’ve also asked appli-
cants to include a list of titles that
they promise to buy should they be
selected as my future roommate,
and I’ve found those lists to be
especially intriguing. But I’d say
the most important part of the
application is the peer evaluation
from current roommates.”

While Williams says that most of
his friends understand that his
application process is the most fair
and democratic way to decide
whom gets to live with him: next
year, current roommate Barry
Kent ’08 resents the fact that
Williams is forcing him to apply
along with the rest of the applicant
pool.

“I’ve lived with Danny for two
years, and I just assumed that we
would continue living together
next year, especially considering
neither of us are going abroad,”
said Kent. “But suddenly he got
this great lottery numberand he e-
mails me and about 60 other peo-
ple this enormous Word document
questionnaire. When I figured out

what it was, I just couldn’t believe
it > :

Despite his protest, Williams
has not yet disqualified Kent,
whose lottery number happens to
be one of the worst in his class, as
a candidate.

In fact, Williams says that their
prior relationship as roommates
would factor favorably into his
assessment of Kent’s application.
to the extent that status as a
Davidson College legacy would fac-
tor into admission.

As the deadline for applications
approaches, Williams expects to

- begin to make cuts and interview

prospective roommate finalists on
an individual basis.

“I’m looking forward to the
interviews,” said Williams. “It
gives me the opportunity to get a
more personal idea of who the
applicants are and, in. the event
that I am already. friends with the
applicant, the chance to hold the
power of my high lottery number
over ent.”
