To the Editor:

Or rather to Paul Flood, Dave Flem-
ing, Tom Schember, and Steve Stine:
I’m not about to discuss .the merits of
your letter to the editor or of the David-
Sonian.. But regarding your statement,
“As for the Literary Supplement. . . We
think it’s better to leave fine arts to the
fine parchment. . .”I might note that
throughout the nineteenth and into the
twentieth century American newspa-
pers regularly published short stories
and poems. Newspapers have ceased to
assist our nation’s best authors and have
increased,the space allotted to fashion,
cooking, sewing, gardening, home dec-
oration, and similar subjects. Such fea-
tures promote the products of advertis-

ers and influence the American lifestyle —

(sic). Shame on American newspapers.
And thanks to. the Davidsonian: for
bucking the commercial tide and pres-
enting stories and poems by our best lo-
cal authors. Contribute to a great Amer-
ican newspaper tradition and keep pub-
lishing the heey Supplement.’

To the Editor:

We the undersigned indignantly
protest a flagrant violation of the re-
vered Davidson Honor Code. In an at-
‘tempt to beautify our campus and re-
spond appropriately to the Phi Delt/
North Meck. lawn furniture, we last
week erected a Greco-Aqua-Mortico-
Romanesque monument on our front
lawn. Shortly thereafter, Cindy Faul-
kenberry’s cute little orange duckies
(ducus cutus orangatangus), two (2) in
number, were forcibly removed from

' the afore-mentioned garden sculpture.
_In addition, the surrounding protective

enclosure (fensus wimis) was irrepara-

ble mangled.

' These activities obviously consti-

tute a gross infraction of both the Honor

Code and the Code of Responsibility.
We of ATO will not forget!

Signed,
Lindsey Biddle ’83

To the Editor:

I just want to congratulate the group
of students who got together to present
the play Godspell. | think it’s great that
at a school as small as Davidson there is
still the interest and talent to produce so
moving a representation. These stu-
dents did it for pure enjoyment and are
donating the profits to the upcoming
drama Raleigh. Many thanks to them
for thoroughly entertaining us as well as

_reminding us of more important matters

than our usual mundane problems.

Sincerely,
Connie Terry

To the Editor:

Few people are prouder than myself
as to the progress of the Davidson Col-
lege Basketball team this year. Such a
fine effort from the players and coaches
should be rewarded by loyal fan sup-
port, student support and cheerleader
support. However, such was. sorely
lacking at the Davidson-Furman game
and especially the Southern Conference
Tournament.

My hearty congratulations to the
cheerleaders that did come to the David-

son-Furman game. They did a good job;
however, they were few in number. The
students that were there also did a fine
job. What was most embarrassing to the
school and alumni was the Saturday
telecast of the championship game of
the Southern Conference Tournament.
For the first time in many years, David-
son had a chance to win the Southern
Conference and go on to the NCAA Re-
gional play. You would think that
cheerleaders, whose rooms would be
paid for by the college, as I understand
it, would be excited and supportive of
the team in such-a situation. I realize
that the game occurred.at the end of the

spring break for the school; however, it .

seems to me that ‘Cheerleaders who are
really interested. in their school and its

athletics could take.a few days off from.

their. precious spring break and support
their school by being at the champion-
ship game. It was extremely embarrass-
ing to see the supporters, the band and
the cheerleaders who were there and
supporting the University of Tennessee
at Chattanooga; then the camera would
swing around the arena and the only Da-
vidson supporter that was there, other
than the fans, was the Wildcat..My con-
gratulations to him. At least he has the
right spirit. If the cheerleaders cannot
do the job that they are supposed to do
for Davidson College, then get some ~

_hew cheerleaders, or, if you want to, I'll

be glad to suit up and lead the cheering
section myself. The cheerleaders and
the pep band both have an obligation not
only to the school when they take such a
task as they have, but most importantly
to the basketball team. I hope something
is done about the cheerleading situation
before next year.

Sincerely,
John F. Cutchin

Letter to the Student Body:

Traditions come and traditions go.
This week, at Davidson College, anoth-
er institution has gone the way of man-
datory chapel, passing relatively unnot-
ed from the whirl of activity that propels
us from day to day. The institution
whereof I speak is the “Senior Candids”
section of the yearbook. Conceived in
1969, the section enjoyed a long and
happy life, but it seems to be an idea
whose time has come. Participation in
recent years has dwindled steadily, and
I have judged this year’s turn-out insuf-
fiscient to justify continuing the prac-
tice. On March 8, after three months of
extensions, letters, and warnings, only
half of the senior ‘class had submitted
candids. This just isn’t enough support
to warrant spending 20% of our meager
budget and 20% of the book’s pages on
the project. It’s not fair to the rest of the
college community, nor is it fair to the
staff, which has its own deadlines to
meet.

This letter does not purport to place
blame on those who declined ‘to take
part in this tradition. I merely wish to
announce my desire to produce a year-
book that in every way reflects the activ-
ities and attitudes of the Davidson Col-
lege student body. Your abstention indi-
cated to me that perhaps I can find a
more suitable use for those seventy-odd

pages.

Note: For those who did turn in candids,
‘please check announcement sheet for
instructions on claiming your photos. —
Thanks anyway!
