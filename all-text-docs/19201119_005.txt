DR. METCALF ENTERTAINED
BY SIGMA UPSILON.
— e
Informal Discussion Features Meet-
ing of Literary Fraternity.

The Blue Pencil Chapter of Sigma Up-
siton held an informal meeting last
Monday night in honor of Dr. J. Calvin
Metcalf, who was instrumental in found-
ing the Rotunda Chapter of Sigma Up-
silon at the University of Virginia. After
an informal talk by Dr. Metcalf, the
gathering adjourned to enjoy the re-
freshments which were provided.

During his talk, Dr. Metcalf reviewed
briefly the history of literary gtoups.
The first literary lights who combined
together were a group of men in the
middle of the seventeeth century. Au-
brey was the leading member, and the
orrganization was called the Sodality in
a Tavern. They met together in an ale
house in London, and combined good
fellowship with intellectual and literary
discussions.

In this country, the Saturday Night
Club of Boston was the first literary or-
ganization. In it were such men as
Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Later on, in New York, another band of
men met together to discuss literature
and literary problems. Of this group
James Fennimore Cooper was the most
noted member.

These different clubs served their pur-
pose well, for besides joining together
the brighest literary minds of the day,
they fostered and encouraged literary
effort and production: In the present
day there is no such outstanding club.
Its place has beep taken by the literary
groups, many of them local in character,
in the various colleges of the country.
These organizations aim, as a whole, to

™! foster the study and appreciation of lit-

erature on the part of its members, and
more especially to bring out and develop
the latent literary talent which so often
lies uncovered.

Practically the only national organiza-
tion of this kind in the United States is
the fraternity of Sigma Upsilon, which
has 21 or more chapters in different col-
leges and universities. This organiza-

B/ tion is honorary, but also social in char-
Hjacter. Its members are selected from
| the two upper classes, and aim to take in

those men on the campus: who have
shown especial ability in, or interest for,

ithe literary productions of the campus.

After Dr. Metcalf had ended his

- speech, hot cocoa, cake, and cigars were
#! passed around. The entertainment was

j thoroughly enjoyed by all, and was end-

B,ed only by the approach of the supper

hour.

the Kappa Alpha hall. The new men

Caskill, D. W. Roberts, R. L. Rogers, J.
B. Sizer and J. R. Walker.

There are chapters of this honorary

| southern colleges. The following David-

son students were already entitled to

S|! wear the O. D. K. key: Currie, Romefelt,
wi J. E. Cassell and L. B. Schenck.

Dr. Martin, Dr. Sentelle, Dr. McCon-
nell and Mr. Jackson compose the fac-

S\ulty membership of the fraternity.

&i|NO MORE HUNTING FOR

DAVIDSON STUDENTS.

Many of the students have been hunt-

S\ing around here lately, and there has

been some complaint. Many of thé
farmers have requested that students do
not hunt on their land until the season

B\is open. In past years the season has

coming in about November, but on ac-
count of game being so scarce this sea-
son will not open until December.
Furthermore, anyone outside of the
state of North Carolina cannot hunt here
without a North Carolina license, and
some counties require a county license
also. Anybody has the right to report
one for hunting out of season, or with-
out a license, and probably a fine will
be imposed accordingly. “A word to the

y| wise is sufficient.”

Later in the day C. K. openly ac-

day the eleventh for their first annual
Armistice Day banquet.

The banquet hall was tastefully dec-
orated with the national colors. The
cener-piece of each table was carefully
worked out with ,small flags and red,
white and blue ribbon. Small silk flags
were given as souvenirs. Sixty covers
were laid for the members of the post
and their friends.

The menu was carefilly prepared by
Mrs. Brady and her assistants, which
appealed to the tastes of the former
fighting men. And there is no doubt but
that it hit the spot. Instead of the erst-
while army beans and army bread, the

For Nearly a Century

Columbia Theological Seminary has been training men
for the Gospel Ministry. It is under the control of South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Florida, with a mem-
bership of 89,000 communicants. Its Faculty was
never more complete and efficient than at present.

Many improvements to the plant is contemplated for the
near future.

During the festivities A. P. Ormond
and Frank Law rendered the latest
melodies on piano and saxophone. Lt.
Col. J. W. MacConnell, M. C. R., post
commander acted as toastmaster and
made the principal address of the even-
ing. He told of the trials and privations
of the doughboys overseas in a humor-
ous way. '

Colonel MacConnell launched into a
more serious vein as he discussed the
needs and aims of the post. His, main
plea was that there ought to be es-
tablished at an early date a woman's
auxiliary of the post to be composed of
the relatives of the members. He stress-
ed the good that such an organization
could do in furthering the social activi-
ties of the post.

Everybody present voted a good time
and it is contemplated that .the banquet
be made an annual affair.
