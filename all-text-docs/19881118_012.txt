Volleyball

Wildcats end season
with 27-14 record

By MARY FAITH MOUNT

The Davidson volleyball team
ended a fine season with a thrill-
ing victory over UNC-Greens-
boro (13-15, 5-15, 15-11, 15-7,
15-3).

After two lackluster games, the
team found themselves down 6-
11 in the third game before rally-
ing to take the match.

Coach Rebecca Hawkins com-
mented that in the first game of
the season the team was behind 2-
14 against Winthrop College. The
Cats rallied to win that game and
the match.

According to Hawkins, the
team learned in that game that
they are “never out of it until the
final whistle is blown.”

As soon as the third game was
Davidson’s, UNC-G was totally
out of the last match.

Many players did not begin to
play well until the third game.
Two seniors, Maria Douglas and
Lavetta Dawkins, turned it on
midway through the game.

Hawkins attempted to alleviate

the anxiety both Douglas and
Dawkins felt about playing their
last match at Davidson. Their
play helped motivate the rest of
the team.

Mimi Plauche cranked up her
intensity and power. She was
unstoppable in the fourth and fifth
games. UNC-G failed to block her
high, hard hits. She provided the
offense for the team.

Ellen Ott added what Hawkins
called “terrific defense.” The
team as a whole had 115 digs.

The Cats ended their season
with a 27-14 record, by far the
best ever. The losses included two
to East Carolina, one to Georgia
Tech, two to Georgia, and two to
UNC-G.

Hawkins is concerned about the
voids that Douglas and Dawkins
will leave. Also, another void will
be created since Ott will spend her
junior year abroad.

Weight-training, limited prac-
tices, and some USVBA tourna-
ments on weekends will fill the
off-season for the Wildcats.

nity, Stoeckel says he will be
happy under current admis-
sions policies.

Also, Stoeckel feels he can
make certain budgetary sacri-
fices, if necessary. “I can get by
with what we have money-
wise.”

Addressing the recent exit
from the Southern Conference,
Stoeckel feels much like bas-
ketball coach Bobby Hussey.
Without a conference champi-
onship, it is very difficult for
his team to receive a bid to the
NCAA Regional Tournaments
at the end of the season.

“Tt hurts us not being in a
conference. We have a very un-
realistic chance of making an
NCAA Regional Tourna-
ment.”

In particular, independent
status has forced Stoeckel to set
high goals for his team just to
have hopes of receiving an at-
large bid. “As an independent
team, we have to schedule
close to sixty games to have a
chance to get into a regional,”
he says.

Furthermore, travel must in-
crease, as the team must reach
out geographically to find |
teams to play. As Stoeckel
says, “It causes us to have to go
farther to play good teams.”

Consequently, he has sched-
uled a spring-break trip to Flor-
ida for the 1989 season. This
will give Davidson players a
chance to travel and play good
teams and will also give

Stoeckel recruiting exposure.

Stoeckel believes that expan-
sions like this will increase the
difficulty of his schedule, but he
sees this trend as healthy. “One
good thing about not being in a
conference is that it has allowed
us to schedule a lot of good
teams.”

He points out that Davidson
will play only eight non-Division
I games this season, saying “this
year our schedule is much
tougher.”

Although independent status
has affected scheduling, it has not
really been a bane on recruiting.
According to Stoeckel, the oppor-
tunity to receive a quality educa-
tion eomes first in the minds of
recruits, who then look at the
baseball schedule and the oppor-
tunity for post-season play.

However, without the possibil-
ity for post-season play, no real
motivator exists. “It’s probably a
dead end, as far as baseball goes,
as an independent,” says
Stoeckel. “The health of our pro-
gram depends on us getting into a
conference.” ;

The new athletic complex,
while not directly aiding baseball
recruiting, does give an indication
of Davidson’s dedication. “It’s
nice to say to people, “Look at the
commitment that Davidson is
making to athletics,’” Stoeckel
says.

However, recent public discus-
sions about the football program
bother Stoeckel.

“Ata college like this, we need
to work our own internal prob-
lems out among ourselves and
make sure that our differences are

not viewed by the public.”

In particular, Stoeckel refers
to the recent article in The
Charlotte Observer investigat-
ing the different opinions on
the athletic policy. “I don’t
think that the article that came
out in The Observer was in the
best interest of Davidson.”

He calls such comments. in
the article as “‘bridge-burning”
and “not constructive.”

As someone who played two
sports at Harvard, Stoeckel
supports the efforts to get
Davidson football back on its
feet. “I’m pro-football,” he
says. “I think it’s a great game.
I would hate to see football
leave Davidson. |. think an
unhealthy Davidson football is ~
better than no Davidson foot-
ball.”

He believes that ending the
football program would’ re-
move an opportunity from
many people who could bene-
fit from both the academic and
athletic sides of Davidson.

Finally, Stoeckel applauds
the effective use of Davidson’s
resources in attracting high-
quality -student-athletes. “I
knew [when I came to.
Davidson that] I was going to
be working with some really
bright people who wanted an
opportunity to developas base-
ball players.” :

These student-athletes, ac-
cording to Stoeckel, contribute
to the life of the college and
receive a great education in the
process. To Stoeckel, that is
what a liberal arts education is
all about.
