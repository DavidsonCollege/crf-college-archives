Christian season of Easter was de+
serving of a vesper service of equal
quality. The church service of last
Sunday was at least a step in that
direction, The Glee Club was the
central feature of the program, sing-

ing the Crusaders Hymn; a dramatic.

‘anthem, The Creation; the Bach

chorale, Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring,
with oboe obbligato by Frank West;
and the old song, In.Josephs Lovely
Garden. A solo part was taken in
the last. by Miss Margie Bates of
Queens, who also sang the Mozart
Alleluia, The prelude was the Crea-
tion Hymn of Beethoven, played by
a brass choir, which also played
chorales as the postlude.

Hogson and Julien Cicandel, who
were pursued from England to Paris
by the irate father. The substitute

fusion. The cast was as follows:
Julien Cicandel, Frank Barr, Jr.,
Concord; Betty Hogson, Helen Da-
vis, Davidson; Interpreter, Timothy
Webb, Cambridge, England; James
Hogson, Middy Raynal, Statesville;
La Caissiere, Peggy McClelland,

tone, Department of Music, gave

several French solos,

As special guests there were pres-
ent the advanced French class of
Mitchell College, accompanied by
Professor Katherine N. Knox. Prin-
cipal Joseph W. Wheeler of States-
ville High School brought his French
students. Concord High School was
represented by Miss Elizabeth Till-
man and her French students. Mrs.
Louise Miller of Harrisburg School
was accompanied by her students,
as was Miss Maude Vinson of the
Davidson High School. After the
performance the visiting teachers
and their pupils, as well as the mem-
bers of the casts and the Davidson
College French students were the
guests of Dr. and Mrs. George B.
Watts at an informal reception,

On Friday evening, March 23, the
Davidson French students present-
ed the same program at Queens Col-
lege, Charlotte, and were the guests
at an informal reception.

Everyone is happy to see Dr.
Watts start producing these plays
after several years of silence. These
plays will bring life to the once dor-
mant French department.

faculty, however, is working with
students toward the end that smaller
groups may in the future be able
to conveniently hold their dances

on the campus.

The success of this S.P.E. - Beta
tamasha was equal to similar joint
affairs which the two fraternities
have held on past occasions, With
many of the dates staying in the
Guest House for the week-end, both
fraternities plan hay-rides or “feeds”
‘at their respective houses for to-

night.

office for all boys who were having
dates for the dances. This regis-
tration included all boys whose dates
were to stay in Duke, and also the
ones whasee dates had permission
from home to remain with friends

in town,

The same rules which wete used
at the last set of dances will be
applied to these dances also, Due
to the fact that there seemed to be
no unfavorable criticism of the rules
after the fast set of dances, the

faculty deemed it wise to leave
them as they are with the hope

that they will remain just as favor-
able at Spring Frolics.

Another important feature of the
dance week-end will be a student
body barbecue to be held on the
golf course on the night of the
first dance. This will be a supper
affair and the entire studeft body
is invited to attend. Also, the dates
of the boys attending the dance
are to be invited.

It is hoped that as many of the
students as possible will secure dates

rand attend these dances, so that

Spring Frolics will be as much of
a success as was Mid-Winters.

Dr, Clarence P. Shedd of the Yale
Divinity school was a recent visitor
on the campus. He met with the
faculty, and spoke at the ‘college
vesper service, and at, ychapel the
next morning.

Dr. Shedd had two conferences with
the faculty during his visit.Both of

these were held in the guest house
lounge, one on Sunday afternoon

at 4:00, and the other at the same
hour on Monday afternoon. The
subject of both these conferences
was the religious program of the
college,

Naturally known as an author and
Dr. Shedd’s ‘life
interest and study have made him an
outstanding authority on the religi-

Christian leader,

ous program on the college campus.
He has been the Stephen M. Cle-
Me-
thods and Director of Studies on
Religion in Higher

ment Professor of Christian

Education at
Yale University since 1939,

cessfully treated at Davidson: Re-
ligion on the University Campus.

“ Lhink On
These Things”

By Ed Golden

Continuing with the timely sub-
ject of ,“Thinking On These
Things,” I shall continue to give
the main points of religious em-
phases that have been voiced on
our campus recently.

On March 25, we had the pleasure
to hear the Rev. Neil R. McGeachy
of Statesville on “What Christian
Faith Means To Us”. Mf. McGeachy
touched upon a subject that is ex-
tremely vital to all of us, but one
in which we put very little faith.
That is the subject of faith. In all
of us faith seems to play such a
half-hearted part, yet we forget that
Christ wants us to put more faith
in Him and in the Christian religion.
In faith there is power to cope with
evil and in the Christian faith, there
alone, is found reality. Our lives are
spent in wishful thinking’ too much
in fact. We know hothing or little

at all about God. We have little
understanding about the apostles.
Prayer is the lost word among our
generation. So let’s make our busi-
ness to learn more about out faith
to practice our religion.

One of the religious organiza-
tions on the campus that has been
discussing and having programs,
which, by the way was recently
petitioned for in the Davidsonian,
is the Westminster Fellowship. Just
recently Prof. Fleagle féd an extre-
mely thought-provoking talk and
discussion on a recent article in the
Readers’s Digest. It dealt with the
isms that are covering the earth
with their emotionial tensions, “How
are we as Christians going to meet
the Japanese and others, when their
religion means so much to them,
and our religion has ceased to be
anything but a formal affair? I ask
‘you, how can we? Is it fair to
them? We have gone from the ex-
treme fanatisism of the early Christ-
jans to our luke warm attitude to-
ward God. Please, I beg of you to
“Think on these Things.” It is not
only for you alone, but for our
country and future Americans.

Just recently, Dr. P. H. Gwynn,
Jr., former professor of education
here, gave to the student body a
talk at chapel which, as. yet, has
not, from this reporter, received
any reprocussions, that is, has not
been one to lead into big bull ses-
sions. That is his timely talk on
“Peace Time Conscription.” It is one
that will prove in the future to
be a problem to-our, country,. so
lets get in the know. Witat are your
answers to the problem? Can you
prepare yourself in case you don’t
have any answers? Well, in casq
you can’t, how about being up to
it, and learn more about the sub-
ject. In quite a few recent maga-
zines there have been articles on this
subject. So let’s prepare ourselves.
