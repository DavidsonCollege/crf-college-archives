REV. T. COMP CONDUCTS

SPLENDID SERVICES

The Davidson Student Body has been
exceedingly fortunate during the pasty
week in having Rev. R.T. Coit (Bob)
(v2), back on the Hill, after six years
on the mission field in Korea. In addi-
tion to the regular ¥. M,C. A. meeting
last Thursday night, Mr, Coit conducted
short vesper services on Friday and Sat
urday, which were very helpiul and in-
spiring. ‘Thursday night Mr, Coit based
his talk on Hebrews 12: 129: “For our
God is a consuming fire.” Very clearly
he developed his theme, showing that
fire (1) reveals things, (2) consumes,
(3) purifies. “‘Vhus God reveals Him-
self to us—purifies us, and if we can
tinually refuse Him, consumes us. Mr.
Coit said: ‘“Vhere are hidden things in
our lives which Christ alone can show
us. We think we are in college getting
ready for life, but we are in the midst
of life now and God is here and wants
us. We are living our lives in miniature
here in college.

“We should come aionside of the
matchless hfe of the Master and have
the little hindering, impeding’ barnacles
brushed away:

“We might exert an influence here
now that will touch the uttermost ends
of the world.”

Mr. Coit declared that the great mes-
sage that he received from the Laymen’s
Convention in Charlotte was that “God
is willing to do with an average man
what He has never yet done with a bril-
liant mind.”

Mr. Coit's talks on Friday and Satur-
dav were just as practical and convine-
ing. Preaching both the sermons in the
church an last Sundav Mr. Cott gave a
rineing call to the students of Davidson
College—a call to service. very striking-
lv showin the need in Korea from an
educational, a medical and spiritual
standpoint, respectively.

DEBATING TEAMS
HARD AT WORK

Vhe Emory debate may be postponed,
because of the Easter holidays at. Agnes
Seo College, but ne definite plap has
been decided upon as vet.

Most of the judges have already been
decided upon for both debates. Last
Saturday Kamory held its finals in’ the
local debate, and chase its team to com
bat Davidson.

The four debaters who will represent

Davidson this spring are all rooming: on
one floar and hard at work. Any strang
er happening in either of their reans
would imagine himself in’ a Carnegie
Library and ask fer the fiction depart
ment. But he would be sadly disap
pointed .because nothing but facts and
cold reality are stored away in’ those
massive volumes.
