DR. EGBERT W. SMITH TO
VISIT OUR CONGO MISSION

An official visit will be paid to the
Congo mission of the Presbyterian
Church during the coming winter by the
Executive Secretary of Foreign Mis-
sions, Dr. Egbert’ W. Smith, ’82. Dr.
Smith will sail for Belguim on Novem-
ber 19th. In Brussels he will have a con-
ference with the colonial minister who
has supervision of the government of
the Belgian Congo. From Antwerp he
will sail with a party of missionaries re-
turning to Africa down the Atlantic to
the mouth of the great Congo river.
Two months will be required to make
the trip up the Congo, 1,200 miles, to the
heart of Western Central Africa, where
the Southern Presbyterian mission sta-
tions are located. The visitation of the
mission stations and the long hammock
trips between will require aboit three
menths. The return trip will take an-
other two months, making an absence
of seven months in all.

Dr. Smith will hold, at each of the
five stations, a conference of as many
missionaries as possible, which ‘con-
ference will continue its daily sessions
as long as may be necessary. A tenta-
tive schedule of topics for these con-
ferences has been sent in advance to
these missionaries who are asked to give
careful study to the topics and to make
such careful investigation of the facts
and_ figures. involved or asked for as
may be found practicable. Each con-
ference will last at least five or six days.
A similar plan was pursued by Dr. Smith
on his trip to the Orient a few years ago
with the very best of results.

DEATH OF PEE WEE RATCH-
FORD, ’21.

News of the death of Pee Wee Ratch-
ford, '21, was sent to Davidson last
Thursday evening and spread like wild-
fire over the campus. Some thought it
just a rumor but it quickly proved to be
true. ‘

Edwin Earle Ratchford, ex-’21, was
struck by the engine of the Carolina
Special about three o’clock Thursday
afternoon and died two hours later, with-
out regaining consciousness. The ac-
cident happened on a bad crossing about
a mile below Carlisle, S. C., Ratchford’s
home. It seems that Ratchford and a
Mr. Welch, a friend, were planning to
“go to Union, S. C.,, about 15 miles from
Carlisle on business. Mr. Welch wanted
to go to his home one mile and a half

. below Carlisle to get his coat. So they
‘both started to Mr. Welch’s home in
a Ford touring car with Ratchford driy-
ing.

It so happened that there had been
a freight wreck just below Carlisle and
the engine of the Carolina Special from
Charleston to Cincinnati was switching
up and down the track relaying passen-
gers over the wrecked zone. Coming at
a fast rate it struck the Ford right on
the crossing. The car was torn to pieces,
Mr. Welch was instantly killed and
Ratchford’s skull was crushed. The
engineer failed to notice the wreck and
it was some time before it was discover-
ed Ratchford was carried immediately
to a hospital in Union where he died
about five o'clock in the afternoon. His
body was interred in the family plot in
Union beside his twin brother who died
in infancy.

Ratchford had planned to.come up for
the Wake Forest game last Saturday and
later he intended going to the Univer-
sity of N. C. to study law. Pee Wee
was a good athlete, having played four
years on the baseball team. Though
smell in stature he had a large heart,
-and was one of the most friendly boys
on the campus. His death was a sad
blow for a host of friends both here in
college and in South Carolina where
he was well known.

PATHE NEWS AND A COMEDY
WAS FRIDAY’S MOVIE CARD

Owing to the game
weekly pictures were shown Friday
night. The attractions for the evening
were Pathe News and a comedy featur-
itig Harold Lloyd.

In the Pathe News reel were several
golf scenes, which appealed very much
to Dr. Arbuckle’s followers in this sport.

Although the pictures were short, they
were enjoyed greatly by the student
body. Also due appreciation should be
given to our orchestra, which furnishes
music for these occasions.

On next Saturday night, October 22d,

Saturday, the

“The City of Silent Men,” a Paramount
picture, will be shown.

COURSES IN SHORTHAND

.| TYPEWRITING STARTED HERE

A night class in shorthand and a class
in typewriting has been organized by
W. A. Gamble and O. J. Allison.

The class will meet three times a week
in room number one, Shearer Hall and
at present is meeting on Tuesday, Wed-
nesday and Friday nights, after supper.
However, the time of meeting has not
been definitely decided upon, but will
be determined later according to the
convenience of the majority of the class.

This course should prove very bene-
ficial to all taking it, as shorthand and
typewriting are useful to a man after he
has fyaished college in any occupation in
which he is engaged. It.will also be
very helpful while in college in class-
room, note-book work and in many col-
lege activities.

About twenty have joined the class,
and with application and a little work,
each one will have a fairly good knowl-
edge of shorthand by Christmas.

Allison and Gamble will make com-
petent and able instructors as both have
had a great deal of experience in this
work. :

These men will conduct another class
in the spring for those who can not take
it now.

Here’s why CAMELS are
oo ; e 6 ie
the quality cigarette
I aba we put the utmost quality into this
one brand. Camels are as good as it’s pos-
sible for skill, money and lifelong knowledge of
fine tobaccos to make a cigarette.
Nothing is too good for Camels. And bear this

in mind! Everything is done to make Camels the
best cigarette it’s possible to buy. Nothing is done

simply for,show.

Take the Camel package for instance. It’s the
most perfect packing science can devise to pro-
tect cigarettes and keep them fresh. Heavy paper
—secure foil wrapping—revenue stamp to seal
the fold and make the package air-tight. But
there’s nothing flashy about it. You'll’ find no
extra wrappers. No frills or furbelows.

Such things do not improve the smoke any more
than premiums or coupons. And remémber—you
must pay their extra cost or get lowered quality.

If you want the smoothest, mellowest, mildest
cigarette you can imagine—and one entirely free

from cigaretty aftertaste,

It’s Camels for you.
