ROTC field
training
exercises held
at Ft. Jackson

By Eythan Sontag

While most students spent
their fall break relaxing and study-
ing, Davidson’s ROTCcadets com-
pleted their most intensive training
event of the fall semester.

Davidson joined UNC Char-
lotte and Catawba College for the
annual Field Training Exercise
(FTX) in Fort Jackson, South Caro-

lina, where cadets were given the |

opportunity to hone military skills
such as land navigation, rifle
marksmanship, and repelling.

In addition to enhancing mili-
tary tasks proficiency, the training
was designed to acquaint cadets to
Army living and decorum and de-
velop the leadership skills of jun-
iors who will be going off to Ad-
vanced Camp next summer.

“Stay-
ing in the
barracks
and eating
at the mess
halls gave
us all good
insight into
how the
real Army
operates,” said junior David
Rozelle. He added, “Being in a
position of leadership while under
the stress of constant evaluation

teaches you discipline, time man-
agement, and problem analysis. I

* loved it.”

The weekend’s itinerary was
divided into competitions between
the eight squads of cadets. The
activities included a barracks in-
spection which required vigorous
cleaning Friday night and Satur-
day morning, rifle marksmanship,
obstacle courses that involved re-
pelling, climbing, and rope swings
and bridges; a 10 kilometer timed
road march, and finally a Drill and
Ceremony competition which
_ tested third-year ROTC cadets’
ability tocorrectly give commands
and march troops. Though compe-
tition was fierce, every event was
intended to build confidence and
teamwork.

Several Davidson cadets were

given awards at the end of the,
weekend for their exceptional dem- '

onstratién of leadership, motiva-
tion, and enthusiasm. They in-
cluded freshman Tom
Vanderbloemen, sophomore Mark
Wittschen, and junior G.A. “Red
Rooster” McClung.

The "Little Emperor," an es-
caped convict, and an opera singer
were all guests of honor at a
Davidson gourmet dinner.

One hundred and fifty stu-
dents, faculty and staff mingled in
Vail Commons Wednesday night
for the fall meeting of the Gourmet

Society dinner. Titled “An Evening
With Napoleon,” the evening fea-
tured French cuisine, as well as
music, some history, and a Special
guest appearance.

The purpose of the society,
which meets each fall and spring,
is to “develop an awareness and
appreciation of fine dining,” among

any member of the college com-
munity wishing to participate.

champagne and pate, guests found

mittee member Brian Tarr then

ics department, who honored
Napoleon’s love for the opera by

When the Gourmet Society hosts a dinner in the Commons, diners must compete for reservations.
The recent event focused on the food of Napoleonic France.

singing selections from two pieces,

Members of the society turned
their attention again to food, en-
joying a first course of scallops in
phyllo. This was followed by
tortellini soup, served with white
wine, for those of age.

After guests cleansed their
palate with sorbet, Tarr returned to
the podium to give the audience a
little biographical information
about Napoleon. He was joined by
“the Little Emperor” himself, and
the two revealed a little-known
story about Napoleon’s connec-
tion to Davidson College.

Itis suspected that Davidson’s
own Peter Stuart Ney, donor of the
chandelier found in Phi Hall, was
actually Napoleon aide Marshall
Ney, who eluded his executioners
in France and escaped to the United
States, ending upin Davidson. Tarr
proposed atoast to Ney, Davidson’s
only connection to the man who
once brought nearly all of Europe
under his control.

Guests then partook of the
meal’s main course, consisting of
grilled swordfish, green beans, and
polenta, along with french rolls
and a salad. The feast was con-
cluded with a pear custard tart.
Throughout the meal, dinner mu-

‘sic was provided by members of

Davidson’s string ensemble.

Currently the SGA is consid-
ering several new policies con-
cerning the academic aspects of
Davidson life.

“All of these proposals are
still in the embryonic stages,” says
Senior Class President Jennifer
Humphrey, “Nothing has been fi-
nalized.”:

Retaking Failed Classes -

The first proposal concerns
the option of retaking a class that a
student has failed. Currently, if
students fail a class, they can re-
take it at Davidson and both
grades—the passing and failing
grades—will count towards their
GPA.

The policy being considered

Project Life

approximately 360 volunteers, significantly.more than the
organizers original goal of 300. Although each typing costs —

by the Council on Academic Af-
fairs, chaired by Humphrey, would
allow students to retake classes
and count only the passing grades
on their GPAs. Although failed
courses would appear on students'
transcripts, it would not average in
the final GPAs.

“By doing this we hope to
encourage students to retake classes
here if need be, instead of taking
them in summer school,” said
Humphrey. According to
Humphrey, the proposed plan

would record classes retaken in

summer school as a pass or fail
course. Students would get credit
for passed classes. Failed classes
would average as regularly failed
courses. This would reward stu-
dents taking classes at Davidson.
Standards of Progress
Another proposal being re-
viewed by the council concerns

-* “standards of progress.” Currently,

there is a standard number of

_ courses that students must pass in

order to advance to the next class.
The council is considering incor-

’ porating a GPA requirement into

the standards of progress. There
would not be a required GPA for
‘graduation, but there would be one

|: -for advancement into the sopho-
* more, junior, and senior years.

“The requirement would not
besomething thatis unreasonable,”
says Humphrey, “It would just be
used to keep people from coming
into their senior year and having to
struggle.”

’ Thereis nota high chance that
this policy will put anyone at a
disadvantage. The average gradu-
ating GPA is around a 3.0. The

‘number of students graduating with
‘. under a 2.0 is usually in the single

digits. Another component of this
policy would be that only classes
taken at Davidson would count in
the standards of progress. Stu-

SGA council may challenge existing academic policies

dents could still take classes in
summer school, but only those
classes taken at Davidson would
count in their GPA required to
meet the standard of progress. The
goal of this policy would be to
prepare students and to make them
more viable candidates for the job
market.
Questions

As previously stated, these
policies are still in the planning
stages. The committee has many
questions that need solutions be-
fore the policies could be put into
effect. Some of the questions in-
clude where to draw the line for the
required GPA. Should the require-
ment be the same each year or
should it get harder? If it is not
met, should there be academic pro-
bation? For how long? How many
times can a student be put on pro-
bation before being suspended?
How. long should the probation
last? Asemester? A year? Assoon
as these problems are worked out,
the SGA will decide whether or
not to suggest to the administra-
tion to change the current policy.
