Prof. Fullbright Gives Royal
Entertainment in Eu. Society

Phi. Society Dispenses With Meet-
ing on Account of Cold Weather

In a ragged debate in the Eu-
menean Society Saturday night, the
affirmative, Heizer, Sorrells, Liston
and McKutchen, won the decision
from their opponents, Craig, Cooper,
Boyd and Gamble. The subject dis-
cussed was: Resolved, that the
Peace Treaty should be submitted
to the people at the coming presi-
dential election.

The speakers alt gave evidence of
a certain amount of preparation, but
the organization of the material in
hand was poor, and though here and
there a little real enthusiasm was
shown, the debate as a whole was
woefully lacking in ginger. The re-
viewer rendered his usual eulogy of
Liston’s debate, that it was the best
he had ever heard delivered by the
. aforesaid.

But the feature that converted a
dull and listless meeting into an oc-
casion of great glee, was the speech
of Professor Fullbright.
before a hall full of boys satiated
with listening, eager to get to the
picture show which was about to
start, he held, not only their atten-
tion, but their wholehearted and en-
thusiastic interest until after the
audience knew the picture show was
well under way. continuing so long
only because of the vociferous de-
mand from the entire hall that he
continue. He spoke at first of the
value of literary society work and
of the excellence of the work of Da-
vidson’s socictics. tle then told a
whole scries of humorous personal
anecdotes that produced an almost
continuous riot of laughter. Then,
after the recitation of several poems

STEALING TIME AND MONEY JUST
THE SAME.

«

The man who picks your pocket and
makes off with your money or your
watch is merely taking what he wants
without any regard to morals.

The man who steals from his em-
ployer the time for which he is paid is
doing exactly the same as the pick-
pocket.

Stealing time is just as much a sin as
stealing money.

The man who satisfies his. conscience
in stealing his employer's time would
have no difficulty in satisfying his con-
science in robbing the cash drawer after
he had done it two or three times, for
the spirit is exactly the same, the moral
turpitude is the same, for time is money

just as much as money is money. The,
only difference is that so many people |

steal time by working inefficiently or not
whole-heartedly that there is more com-
panionship in this kind of stealing than
there is robbing a cash drawer, and the
law punishes the latter and not the
former.

The time should come, however, when
the law takes cognizance of time steal-

_ing and places it on a par with money

stealing. When men come to a full
recognition of these truths there will
be a great change in the spirit of work.
Then men will see that if they want to
be honest they must work honestly. The

who would like to read them may
get them by asking the librarian
about them. They are very inter-

will find it well worth vour time to
read any one of them or all of them.

Phi Society

Owing to the inclemency of the
weather and other prevailing condi-
tions, the Phi Society had no de-
bate Saturday night.

The society met and had the roll
call and minutes read. At this junc-
ture the gentleman adjourner made
a motion that the society postpone
the whole program for one week.
This was seconded and passed by
the house. The committee appoint-
ed to look into the heating situation
promised to have some warmth by
next Saturday night. The full pro-

am that was due to come off on
the 17th will be carried out next Sat-
urday night, January 24.
