Kappa Sigma group seeks freshmen, charter

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Leaders of the Kappa Sigma
interest group say the organization
will need to attract at least 25-30
freshmen this year in order to gain
a Patterson Court House and a na-
tional fraternity charter.

Sophomore Drew Henderson,
who is an elected member of the
group’s- senior consulting com-
mittee, said the group currently
has about 35 active members and
needs approximately 60 members
for the college to grant it aneating
house.

Up until this weekend, the
Kappa Sigma interest group has
had to observe the Patterson Court
rule which prohibits freshmen
from entering Patterson Court
houses or attending rush events
during the first five weeks of
school. But the group has been
meeting weekly and planning sev- .
eral rush activities for homecom-
ing weekend, including a. semi-
formal party tonight at the former
ATO house and a mixer tomorrow
afternoon at the M & M Soda

Shop.

Sophomore member Lowell
Keller said the coHege’s granting
permission to the Kappa Sigma
group to use the former ATO
house “is an important step, be-
cause it shows some recognition
by the administration that we are a
real entity rather than just a
loosely-bound group of students.”
The Kappa Sigma group ‘has in-
vited the entire freshman class to
attend the semi-formal dance.

Additionally, the group has
invited all freshmen and active
Kappa Sigma alumni to attend to-
morrow’s party at the M & M.
Henderson said this party will be
“an opportunity for us to work as

broad a spectrum as possible, to _

get in contact with alumni, as well
as to show the freshmen who we
are and meet them individually
and get to know them.”

In addition to planning rush
activities, the group has been
making the necessary contacts
with the Kappa Sigma national or-
ganization and with Davidson.

Kappa Sigma alumni. Henderson
said that an official from the
Kappa Sigma national organiza-
tion had come down to visit last
spring and “was very enthusias-
tic” about getting a chapter started
here.

Keller noted that Davidson
Kappa Sigma alumni have been
very encouraging toward ‘the
group’s efforts. “From what J un-
derstand, the Kappa Sigma chap-
ter on campus here was very ac-
tive. It was.one of the best Kappa
Sigma chapters in the country,
and so the alumni is very strong.
We’ve had a lot of contact with the
alumni, and a lot of them have
been really supportive and en-
thusiastic.”

The group sent out 325 invita-
tions to active Kappa Sigma
alumni for this weekend’s
homecoming activities.

‘Peruvian addresses cocaine

International cooperation is
the key to ending the drug trade,
asserted former Peruvian drug
prosecutor Gabriella Sevillano in
her lecture “Cocaine: The Latin
American Connection” Wednes-
day in the 900 Room. “‘It is such a
big problem that Latin American
governments are incapacitated,”
she said.
Sevillano, who was speaking
as part of the Dean Rusk Program
for International Studies, will be

countries, Sevillano said. “The
drug smugglers have. drawn their
net around all Latin American
countries except Chile.”

Much of the problem is the
centuries-old poverty of the far-
mers forced to take up drug culti-
vation, she remarked. “There are
a large number of farmers in-
volved . . . the cocaine trade is a
very important employer” to
people in the region. Sevillano’s

“The people there cannot un-

wrong,” she continued. “It is their
life, it is their work,” it is the only
thing that can put bread on the
table for their families, she said.

' The real danger in the situa-
tion, she said, is.“just being in the
middle. You have your duties in

“All there is is land, land,

Sevillano explained. The drug

merely “‘an escape from poverty

The incident.that convinced
Sevillano to leave the country was
in October 1985, when a former
neighbor of hers disappeared.
Eight days later his body was

ter to conduct three community
Service projects, and the Davidson
group completed this requirement

_ during the past spring when it

sponsored projects for Cystic Fib-
rosis, the Special Olympics, the
Metrolina Food Bank, as well as
several other organizations. The
dance-a-thon for Cystic Fibrosis,
which the Kappa Sigma group
held jointly in April with Spencer.
House, netted over $1200 for the
Cystic Fibrosis foundation.

Dean of Students Will Terry,
who is chairman of the Council on
Campus and Religious’ Life
(CCRL) said.the Council is “fol-
lowing the same procedure with
Kappa Sigma that we followed
with Warner Hall, Spencer, and
Sigma Phi Epsilon.” The CCRL
must give final approval to an or-
ganization before it can obtain an
eating house.

Terry said, “We are saying
that you need 60 people to start a
new house — to give us reasona-
ble assurance that it’s going to
float. That’s the bottom line re-

quirement, and then we look at
how viable is the organization, be-
cause it costs some investment by
the college to start a house up. We
don’t want to spend the money if
we don’t think the house is going
to float.”

Terry said the college accepts
the responsibility of providing all
the kitchen equipment and dining
equipment for a new Patterson
Court house.

Both Dean Terry and Keller
said neither the Kappa Sigma
group nor the CCRL has yet ad-
dressed the issue of whether the
group will be allowed to partici-
pate in self-selection next Feb-
tuary. Terry said one ‘sticking
point” is that some students and
faculty “say we've already got
enough fratemities on campus.”
But he said the CCRL “will still
recommend to me and the presi-
dent that the Kappa Sigma interest
group be allowed to form a chap-
