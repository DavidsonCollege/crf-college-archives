D. P. HUTCHISON DIED RECENTLY.

—_

One of Davidson’s Noted Alumni and
Charlotte’s Pioneers Dead.

Mr. D. P. Hutchison, a prominent mem-
ber of the class of '74, died recently at
his home in Charlotte. After declining
health covering a period of six years,
he passed away on the morning of Tues-
day, April 25th; paralysis was the im-
mediate cause of his death.

Like many truly great men, he had
abounding hope and faith in the future
of his native city of Charlotte. His was
not only a dream, but much of his time
was devoted to public life. and he was
known throughout the city as a public-
spirited man.

Mr. Hutchison was a strong advocate
for anything he believed was for the
betterment of his town and country.
For 25 years he was the chairman of the
board of trustees for Charlotte town-
ship, this board having charge of all
the road and street building within the
limits of the township and outside the
city limits. Throughout this 25-year
period, he was closely associated with
C. H. Wolfe and Col. W. W. Phifer, and
this caused them to be known as the
“magisterial triumvirate.”

The following tribute has been paid
to him: “He was a firm believer in
progress and a champion of such meas-
ures and movements as he believed
were conducive to the progress of the
city. He was conservative in all his
views, a man of firm convictions and un-
movable when he took a stand for or
against a faction or an issue.

“His influence in political affairs was
great, and by reason of his following and
strength of his views, it was far-zreach-
ing. Any issue that he believed con-
ducive to a greater Charlotte, found his
loyal support.”

Though Mr. Hutchison was never a
seeker of public office, he repeatedly.
held various offices of responsibility and
importance while a citizen of Charlotte.

He was a member of the Second Pres-
byterian Church in Charlotte. He is
survived by two daughters and one
grandson.

Be Here for Commencement.

ATTENTION CLASS OF ’17.

Dear Classmates:

In the absence of a regulary elected
alumni presidént, I am taking it upon
myself to use the columns of The Da-
vidsonian to sound the clarion call for
a 100 per cent reunion when commence-
ment comes around May 28-31.

I have heard from a number of you
and if the enthusiasm of these compara-
tively few is any index, ours without a
doubt is going to be a record-breaker in
point of both attendance and interest
Now, let every man who-has not already
done so begin making arrangenients
right now to get off from his work-a-day
cares for at least a couple of days, so
that his face may not be missing when
the gang’s all there. Eb.Nesbit and. Bill
Neal will have plenty of room around
the festive board for all of us, and of
course the bullfests will continue indefi-
nitely as of old “on the hall.”

Truly “college ties can ne’er be
broken,” and there'll be a peculiar pleas-
ure in the hearty handshakes and re-
newal of the old friendships. Bring the
family, if you have any, or if, like my-
self, you haven’t any, don’t be ashamed
to come anyway.

Faithfully yours,
Bie I Keithen.

DELTA PI KAPPA INITIATES
SEVEN EMBRYO JOURNALISTS
The Delta Pi Kappa Journalistic Fra-
ternity held a very interesting meeting
on Friday night. The meeting was held
for the purpose of introducting seven
new members into the sacred rights of

L. D. Elkins, W. T. Elliott, W. P. Brown,
W. A. Gamble, E. H. Mauze, Aiken and
Dunbar Ogden. The meeting was inter-
esting in two respects, first in that it
furnished amusement for the members
in the performance of the initiation rites,
and secondly in that a copious feed was
furnished to the whole fraternity. The
feed consisted of three complete courses
and was thistoug tly enjoyed by evety-
one.

ful, but in every way befitting the oc-
casion on which she will speak.

In addition to this the‘ Laymen’s
Double Quartette, of Charlotte, will ren-
der special music, carrying out in song
the program in honor of our mothers.
This double quartette has visited a num-
ber of places in the State and has wona
place of high rank among other quar-
tettes. This feature of the program will
add much to its impressiveness and it
will be a rare treat to hear them sing.

his poem, the “Gypsies,” preceded by a
short talks on gypsies, in‘which he told
of their dress, independence and oc-
cupations, dwelling especially on their
fortune-telling, and their propensity for
roaming. His poem tells of the thoughts

that overtake one wien hearing a gypsy |

fiddler.

Another poem pictured the typical far-
mer-preacher of Indiania, “a citizen well-
nigh a king,” who read by night and
built his life by day; a statesman in the
ficld, and “a man who served a rigid
Christ. :

Probably his most interesting inter-
pretation was the one giving an old negro
preacher’s sermon on Simon Legree,
inspired by seeing “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”
Simon was a terrible character with ev-
ery fault possible and “he wore a snake-
skin tie.” Simon was soon “down there
with the de-vo-oo-ol” where all of his
kind go. Several other readings were
giving, including the “Building of Spring-
field,” the poet’s home town.

Mr. Lindsay came to Davidson from
Boston and Richmond under the auspices
of the Blue Pencil Club, of the College,
and the Book Lovers’ and Thelemites of
the village.

Presbyterian Church was a revelation to many who readit.

He sent the names of the heads of the families of his congregation

Theological Seminaries was a surprise to me.”’
