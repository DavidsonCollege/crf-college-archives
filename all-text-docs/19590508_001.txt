Indications are that Da-
vidson College will be asked
again next year to partici-
pate in the College Quiz

owl. A letter received by
President Martin from John
Cleary, Producer of the G.
E. College Bowl, seemed to
indicate that Davidson will
be invited to compete again
on the television contest.

“I feel that this letter is
quite a tribute to the col-
lege” commented President
Martin when asked his reac-
tion to the letter. “I don’t
think the board would have

sent it unless there were-

some real chance they
would invite us next year.
STRONG STATEMENT
“This is a strong state-
ment for the man who real-
ly selects the colleges. I be-
lieve that last statement in
the letter means more than

first paragraph. Mr.
Cleary’s remarks are high-
ly favorable to the college
and particularly to our
team.”

Q. Would the college
agree to compete again if
asked next year?

A. I think we would, and
with enthusiasm. I know of
no activity that has brought
more favorable national
publicity to the college. I
think this spring participa-
tion was stimulating not on-
ly to our faculty and stu-
dent body but to those of
us on the sidelines.

FAVORABLE PUBLICITY

Q. Did the program last
month provide the expect-
ed national publicity for
Davidson College?

A. There have been many
favorable comments both to
myself and to others con-
nected with the telecast.

Chr

cards were sent to alumni
and friends of the college
and we feel that there was
a large audience watching.
Television Station WBTV
ran a series of announce-
ments a few days before
and co-operated greatly by
publicizing the program.

Of course, we have not
had a sudden flood of ap-
plications from all over the
country. I feel that the im-
pact of the program will be
getting other boys interest-
ed in coming to Davidson.

WELL-DONE PROGRAM |

Q. In view of your rela-
tions with the program,
what do you think of it?

A. Although the time
limit imposes restrictions
and the questions often do
not test the panelists’ rea-
soning abilities, I feel that
the “College Bowl” is an ex-
ceptionally well-done pro-

told the DAVIDSONIAN, promise, but I think this

Dr. Paul Marrotte, who cate that we will be asked we will be considered next
coached this year’s team, back. I don’t consider it a year. I am ‘sure alumni and
faculty are interested in us
being given another try and
I think the students are, al-
so, from what I hear.

Q. What are the pro-
spects for a team next
year?

A. I'm sure we will be
ready. We could “recruit”
a very good team.

SPEED UP
PREPARATION

Q. Would you make any
changes in the way the
team went about preparing
for the quiz?

A. No. I don’t think we
would change the basic way
in which they prepared.
However, we could speed
up the process of prepara-
tion next year since we
know a little more about

COLLEGE BOWL QUIZ

Dear Dr. Martin:
I want to thank you for the wonderful team
you sent to Minneapolis to represent Davidson on

the G. E. COLLEGE BOWL. Believe me, the score
is no indication of the impression these boys made
on the people at the University and ourselves.

I suppose Dr. Marrotte told you how well the
boys did in the warm-up, and actually we all felt
we would be in North Carolina the following
week. They were real gentlemen and true sports-
men.

I hope that next year we may have the op-
portunity of entertaining a team from Davidson
again. Thank you for everything.

Sincerely,

G. E. COLLEGE BOWL

Business Office Issues
Report On Court Costs

Editor’s note: The following is a statement released by the business office in answer
to last week's editorial concerning the increase in the fraternity housing fée.

The editorial in the May Ist issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN about the Fraterni-

ty Housing Fee needs some clarification as to facts and inferences.
The fees charged to fraternity members for the first and second semesters of

the current year were based on the estimated

ability of final cost figures.

These fees were purposely

that students would not be overcharged.

There is no question of pro-
fits for the college in connec-
tion with this or any other pro-
ject because the charter of the
college prohibits the making of
a profit, and all income re-
ceived from any source is used
for the benefit of the educa-

‘

tional program. |

It is, however, required
that the endowment funds of
the college be invested to
produce a reasonable return
and to assure safety of the
investment.

The income from this source,

what we are trying to at-
tain. Having had some ex-
perience, we could achieve
results a lot more simply.

We would probabry have
more practice sessions be-
tween our team and out-
side panels. That might be
one improvement in the
preparation, but in the long
run it is difficult to say
whether we would change
our methods or not.

Q. What is your opinion
of the College Bowl Quiz?

A. Most schools which
participate are  well-pre-
pared and the choice of
questions is generally good.
I would say that in about
three out of five contests,
it's luck which causes the
team to win or lose.
