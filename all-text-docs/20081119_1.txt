Dorms on campus have been
competing in the third annual Envi-
ronmental Action Coalition (EAC)
Do it in the Dark competition dur-
ing the past two weeks.

In first place after the second
week of the competition are the
Down the Hill dorms, reducing
their energy consumption by 25.4
percent. Richardson, Cannon, Sen-
telle, Belk and Tomlinson have de-
creased energy usage as well.

Prizes, including a pizza party,
t-shirts and compact fluorescent
light bulbs, will go to students
living in the dorm that decreases
energy usage the most throughout
November. Students living in the
winning dorm will also have the
opportunity to compete for an iPod
and Klean Kanteen water bottles.

A meter on each dorm collects
energy use data in kilowatts per
hour. The EAC recorded the use in
October to create baseline data to
which November’s numbers can be
compared.

Dorms will be compared only to
their own October values to ensure
fair comparison. These compari-
sons, measured in percent change,
will be documented in a poster in
the Union that will show results
from each week in November.

The first week data showed that

EAC hopes that the competition
will encourage Davidson students
to build better energy-use habits.
The event runs throughout Novem-

Somalia: the new battle ground state

Mike ANDERSON
Staff Writer

Ken Menkhaus, a Davidson po-
litical science professor who Time
magazine calls the premier U.S. ex-
pert on Somalia, discussed the Af-
rican nation’s immense problems in
the 900 Room of the Alvarez Col-
lege Union Tuesday night.

He went as far to say “it [the
crisis in Somalia] is the worst in the
world — worse than Darfur.”

He later added, “This could be
one of the biggest policy crises in
the first term of the Obama admin-
istration.”

One of the country’s most press-
ing problems is that it has had no
central government for 18 years.

In addition, the nation has been
in an armed conflict with Ethiopia
since 2006. Piracy has become a
major problem on the coast and se-
curity threats are ever-present.

Menkhaus gave further context
to the nation’s current problems.
He said that historically Somalia
has been incredibly poor, is semi-
arid, is an Islamic society, is based
on a subsistence economy and has
tumultuous relations with Ethiopia.

He added that Somalia’s long-
time statelessness, since 1991, is

.. not a spontaneous occurrence.

From 1969 to 1990, the country
suffered under a military dictator-
ship, one of the most oppressive
ones in Africa, and the groups in
the clan-based liberation movement
that overthrew the dictatorship then
fought among themselves.

This strife led to two years of

civil war, ethnic cleansing, warlord-
ism and famine and then a U.N.-
intervention called United Nations
Operation in Somalia, in which
Menkhaus was involved, failed to
make significant progress.

Now, there are three distinct
regions, one of which has actually
been fairly stable.

The northern part of Somalia,
called Somaliland, is not recog-
nized as an independent state, but,
essentially, functions separately
from the rest of Somalia.

As a stable, democratic and
economically healthy region of So-
malia, it is a beacon of hope for the
rest of the country.

“They are the most democratic
area in the horn of Africa,” Men-
khaus said.

However, Menkhaus mentioned
that Somaliland’s good fortune
must be be short-lived since last
week the war in southern Somalia
spread up north into Somaliland.

The conflict in southern Soma-
lia has intensified ever since Ethio-
pia invaded two years ago.

The invasion, which was U.S.-
backed because of terrorist activity
in the country, toppled the govern-
ment forming under extreme Isla-
mists.

While Menkhaus resisted ac-
knowledging the idea that terrorism
is a real threat in Somalia, he said,
“More recent evidence is suggest-
ing that Al-Qaeda is looking at So-
malia as a base of operation.”

That is not to say that the U.S.
is anti-Somalia. The American gov-
ernment officially backs the Tran-

sitional Federal Government, or
TFG, but not the Muslim extrem-
ists who were vying for power.

The TFG, however, is just the
latest internationally recognized
authority in a line of many ineffec-
tive governments.

Now, the TFG is on the verge of
collapse — it cannot agree on issues
internally. Ethiopia is withdrawing,
too, and a combination of factors
makes the situation the most urgent
humanitarian crisis in the world,
according to Menkhaus.

Millions are displaced, there
has been a massive rise in prices,
widespread money counterfeiting
has led to hyperinflation that essen-
tially makes money worthless and
refugees are amounting in over-
whelming numbers.

While he recognized that So-
maila is in desperate need, Men-
khaus said, “This is today the most
dangerous place to be a humanitar-
ian worker.”

He added that one-third of hu-
manitarian-worker casualties are in
Somalia. Now, many organizations
are hesitant to send workers there.

While he made clear that the
crisis in Somalia is a dire one, he
added that there are “positive ener-
gies” present in the country.

The private sector is booming;
the nation has some of the best en-
trepreneurs in the world.

Also, the nation historically has
had an extraordinary adaptability at
the local level in having had “gov-
ermance but no government.”

ple to change behavior, the contest
will increase awareness about en-
ergy issues. These issues are par-
ticularly important for Davidson
because energy accounts for about
60 percent of the greenhouse gas
emissions from campus.

Commuter
rail rumors

ANDREW Evans
Staff Writer

A commuter rail line con-
necting the town of Davidson to
Charlotte as well as the interme-
diate towns could be operational
as soon as 2012. This rail, ac-
cording to Kris Krider, Planning
Director of the town, “increases
the options for mobility.” Of
course, this depends on the plans
actually getting off the ground.

According to Krider, most
of the details for the commuter
rail are worked out except for the
funding. Right now, engineers
are putting together a 90 percent
plan for the rail. This plan should
be done by early December.

There have been rumors of a
“light rail” coming to Davidson
for the past several years. This is
not entirely accurate because a
light rail and a commuter rail are
not the same thing. A commuter
rail is a diesel locomotive that
can travel faster and farther than
a light rail, which is an electrical
system intended for making mul-
tiple, fast stops.

Sara-Lynn Levine says that
the three towns north of Char-
lotte— namely Huntersville, Cor-
nelius and Davidson—are all in
favor of the rail,

The biggest problem is the
funding. According to Krider,
