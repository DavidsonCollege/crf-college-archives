REPAIR WORK AND BUILD-

From February 12 t4 a series of!
meetings was held at the Gniversity of fg
North Carolina conducted bv the preat
missionary leader, John R. Mott. Sev
eral of the traveling secretaries of the

YoM. Co. AL and one of the secretaries
of the Student Volunteer Movement ING DONE
were present and assisted in’ the cam

paizn.

The meetings had been well adver.
tised, and splendid ‘preparation made by
the students through prayer groups -held
in the dormitories and fraternity houses.
Tt was this preparation on the par of
the students and the earnest: desire «4 a
large number of the men fo get help for
themselves out of the meetings and to
help others which made — possible — the
success which atrended the campaign.

Dr. Mort spoke five times and held
numerous interviews? with | students.
Four of his addresses were on vital
nrohlems of student Ife. About seven
hundred men heard him each time and
they were very much moved by the
nower of his addresses. “The fifth speech
as an account of his recent trip) te
Kurope. in which he vividly impre:sed
his hearers: giving them a new concep-
tion of the motives and attitude of the
ocoole at war.

Besides Dr. Mort's addresces and in
‘erviews a number of short talks were
made and interviews held by the men
who were assisting him. Praver groups
met each night of the three days in’ che
different dormitories and fraternity hoalis
and were the means of bringing many
men to Christ. There were a ninaher
and over three
hundred men who had been professing
Christians took a new stand for Christ.
Tt was a wonderful meetin and one
that will mean much in the lives of the

men at Chanel Hill.
