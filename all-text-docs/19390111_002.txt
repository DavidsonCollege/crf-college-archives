To Be Done f° 1939

As the new year gets under way there are
several needs that come to our minds as
worthwhile objectives for students and ad-
ministration to try to achieve. Here they
are:

A definite athletic policy

Student conduct in assembly

An Alma Mater

Student dress in open meetings

. Cooperation with Court of Control
. Public speaking course

7. Student sentiment against breakage
The athletic policy goes at the head of the

QOuhwne

list because that decision is one of the most
important confronting Davidson at the mo-
ment—one which will affect the future of
the college in no small way. No matter what
decision is reached it will be unpopular with
many students, but the Athletic Council is
carefully considering the matter and we
have confidence in its ability.

Others to the contrary, we think that the
behavior in student body meetings has been

to be an insane asylum.

formal dress, the least we can do is extend
to him the courtesy of putting on a tie and
coat.

Since “time whereof the memory of-man
runneth not to the contrary” the Judge of
the Court of Control has been asking for the
help of the members of the three upper
classes in enforcing the Freshman Regula-
tions. And for the same length of time we
have done nothing about it but gripe be-
cause the Court hadn’t campused Freshman
Jones for not wearing his cap.

Most of the above-mentioned improve-
ments call for action on the part of the stu-
dents, but here’s something we would like
to see the administration do—put into the
curriculum a course on public speaking, One
of the greatest assets a man can have is the
ability to speak and to think on his feet be-
fore an audience and we do not believe that
one who lacks #his ability can be called well-
educated.

The “Question of the Week” in this is-
sue has to do with a return to the old dam-
age fee system of covering |the damage to
college property. We feel that this would
distinctly be a step backward and that the
only solution to the problem is to build up
a conscience in the student body, a senti-
ment against such wanton destruction, and
then there would be no damage to pay for.
It would take time, but could be accomplish-
ed by a concentrated effort. After all, is it
not childish to throw a tennis ball through

a window merely to see it break?

Campus Comments

“The consistent childishness of Davidson
students is amazing. It seems impossible
for them to realize that they are now col-
lege men, not ‘prep school lads, nor inmates
of some state sanitarium, but MEN, who
should be graduated from all infantile char-
acteristics,

“The particular act which inspires this
editorial is the ‘breaking of windows which
occurred before the holidays’. To any visi-
tor who might have seen the results, Da-
vidson would have appeared most unfavor-
ably, and the stranger would probably go
away wtih the impression that it is no place
for sensible men to pursue their education.
And so it reflects upon the entire student
body, whereas only a few of the boorish ele-
njyent is responsible.

“Had this been the first time such high
school practices expressed themselves, it
would not be quite so bad, but these things
occur several times every year, and even
once is enough to make a very undesirable
impression upon outsiders.

“It is, of course, perfectly clear that col-’
Jege men must have fun the same as any-
body else, but when it manifests itself in
such very crude ways as the ‘pre-Christmas’
affair, it falls into the category of what ab-
normal psychology would term an act of

regression; the opposite of progression.
Certainly we don’t want any Davidson stu-
dents getting back to the place where they
will have to be fed with a bottle and follow-
ed around by a nurse.

“So let this be an appeal to you as MEN
to discard all of these immature, unbecom-
ing practices and express your fun in more
_subtle fashion, and in a way that will not
cause disgraceful reflection upon yourselves
and your college.”

With the challenge of Ripley, I present
the dbove editorial which appeared in The
Davidsonian four years ago. The only alt-
eration is the change necessitated by the dif-
fering etiology of the incidents. Yet, how
well it fits the recent difficulty our student
body faced.

Turning again to the old paper, we read:
“The question then arises: ‘Who loves Da-
vidson most?’ he who rests content to swal-

SO LONG, FRED

Through the past years The Da-
vidsonian has had no more staunch
friend than our loyal Alumni Sec-
retary, Fred Smith. Himself ,an ex-
editor, he has many times given un-
selfishly of his time and advice, and
has been the main source of the
pictures which have brought about
such an immense improvement in
the paper in the last two years. His
shoes will’ be hard to fill and we
feel that Davidson has suffered a
great loss. Best of luck, Fred.

“Zaza,” Claudette Colbert, Her-

Zaza steps out of that immortal
book of Zola and comes to life
on the sereen. That Coquettish, vi-
vacious, toast of Paris, who could-
n't keep from loving a man, for-
bidden by the codes of ethics for
her to love him or he her. This mad
little girl (Claudette Colbert) of the
halls sets out to steal the heart of
the hnadsome, indiscreet, Dufresne
(Herbert Marshall) from another.
There is a lyric interlude of love
in a cottage (which may be cut out
by the time you get see the
film), and then the man goes off to
Paris. Zaza learns that Dufresne is
married. She follows in a burst of
anger, invades the home and is con-
fronted by the child of her lover
and his legal spouse. Can she break
up this home when the child looks
at her so. Of course Dufresne comes
back. What will Zaza do? Well, we

Back in school again for a rest
after the hustle and bustle of Yule-
tide find that the
omnious approach of semester ex-

festivities, we
aminations has not as yet dimmed
the exuberant spirits of many mem-
bers of the Student Body, But here
we ate getting ahead of ourselves
because quite a few tall stories have
trickled back to the campus
cerning nefarious activities among

con-

undergraduate celebraters.

Charlie Luther listened to the
yearnings of his heart and took a
trip up Greenville way which only
resulted in his becoming a confirm-
ed jitterbug; Jim Anderson was an
amused onlooker. * But this is mild
in comparison to the goings on of
ladies’ man Sam Hemphill who de-
serted the fair young ladies of Ma-
rion for a little wooing under the
Miami moon only to have the re-
his affection suffer a
nervous breakdown the following
day. It is rumored Sam is now pre-

cipient of

| paring to write his thesis in gradu-

ate school next year on the sub-
ject “The hand is quicker than the
eye.”

Also there are the many fellows
who forgot that it is supposed to be
in the Spring when a young man’s
fancy turns to love and visited the
objects of their affection or enter-
tained heart in their
homes. We nominate for supremacy
Dave King who stole a march by
both visiting and being visited by

these throbs

his “one and only” during the vaca-
tion period.

Some of the Christmas gusto was
carried back to school by several
especially of the
freshmen class who put on extem-
entertainment for the
rest of the Student. Body Saturday
night. We nominate for stardom El-

boys, members

mer Bishop who should certainly
make a great track man with his
speed. Other interesting sights of
the day included Bob Powell copy-
ing the headdress of the Maharajah
of India, Tom Mullen developing
good nursemaid technique although
he turned out to be a sore disap-
pointment, Dick Taylor a sandwich
hog personified, and Harry Hend-
rick becoming one of the boys.
Nothing would be complete with-
out a discussion of the debonair at-
titude of Greensboro’s gift to David-
son—Louis Hipp, who is not too
concerned with the public proceed-
ure prescribed by conventionalism.
Personally I Emily Post

In the Groove

By TOM PERRIN

TO PASS ON REVIEW ....
Somehow we had never thought the
lot of a student assistant, in his
official capacity at least, was a par-
ticularly hilarious one. Maybe we
were right at that, but, something
just turned up that makes things
seem rather brighter than we'd pic-
tured them. It was a review paper
handed in by one of Professor Lil-
ly’s superior sophs; and for sheer
artistic “bull’ the answer to the first
of the five questions is a master-
piece of its type. We cannot print
it all, since it runs for two full
pages, but the following extract
should give you an idea.

Q. Give a minute description of
the fight between Arthur and the
Giant.

A. “... Arthur knocked on the
door, interrupting the giant’s revery.
The Giant, who was an ex-priest,
now turned used-charger dealer,
said, ‘Invenite, et pax vobiscum.’

“Now Arthur’s mother had been
frightened by a priest, and when
he heard the blundering Latin, dash-
ed for the elevator. The giant trail-
ed him to where he caught the
‘West Peachtree, Oglethorpe’ car.
I think the car made that light at
Baker Street, and the Giant didn’t
and you know how long it takes to
change, so Arthur got away.

“The next Monday, the Boxing
Commission told Arthur he'd be
barred from the state, if he didn’t
fight the Giant. (You see, the con-
tract was signed way back in the
16th century, and definitely
iron-clad).

“But our hero had an ace down
his gauntlet...”

Don’t suppose we'd better name
thesauthor of this stuff, but if Edi-
tor Miller wants to sign him up
for “Scripts ’n Pranks,’ we might
arrange an introduction.

DEAN’S HERE AGAIN ....
Those Greek promoters of dancing
festivals were deep in the groove
when they signed Dean Hudson to
team with H. Kemp for the Mid-
Winter set, we think. In fact that
particular week-end looks like just
the thing we'll be needing to steady
our nerves after the college Dean’s
semi-annual purge.

was

NERVES ... Speaking of steady
nerves, we've just met a man who
certainly has 'em. His name is Her-
man L. Jahnke, and he is a steeple-
jack by trade. His home. is Mar-
shalltown, Iowa, but his work takes
him all around. He’s the man you
saw hanging to the top of the cam-
pus flagpole the first of the week,
painting.

Mr. Jahnke would probably im-
press you as one of the most de-
liberate men you ever saw—which,
possibly, is why he is still in busi-
ness after working on steeples, fac-
tory chimneys, flagpoles, and other
high places for twenty-seven years.
He is a rather short man, towards
middle age, slightly German in ap-
pearance, definitely so in accent,
and an amiable talker. The height
of the flagpole (130-feet or so, here,
we learned) doesn’t worry him at
all, unless somebody sets it jiggling
by pulling on a guy wire. That is
annoying—even dangerous
you're at the top.

Mr. Jahnke attaches himself to
the pole by a tricky arrangement
of “lassoes,” making the undertak-
ing fairly safe; and he progresses
up or down somewhat in the man-
ner of a careful measuring worm.
He has painted this pole befote—
the last time was about eight years
ago, when he put up the present
chain. Somebody else has painted
it since then. :

Incidently, his first act of resum-
ing contact with terra firma, Mon-
day, would have made any writer
of advertising happy. He lit a cig-
aret.
