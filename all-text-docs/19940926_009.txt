THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1994 9

Solitude
and
silence

Ive been thinking a great deal
recently about solitude and its role
in my life. I spend a great deal of
my time alone by choice, and I
wonder if I am strange by behav-
ing so.

Ihave seen people go through
stress-induced conniptions just try-
ing to find someone to go to the
Commons with them, calling up
even the slightest acquaintance.
Also, an awful lot of people genu-
inely don’t seem to mind sharing
space with someone else. But to
me, my time and space are exactly
that: mine.

Ihad vowed not to come back
to Davidson this year unless I could
live in a single. If asked:why I felt
so strongly about such an ultima-
tum, I can’t think of a simple an-
swer. Sure, sharing space with
another human being for a few
months can try anyone’s self-re-
straint, but I still can’t pinpoint
exactly why I felt my own airspace
was necessary to my mental well-
being.

I like to have control over
things, especially my environment.
Silence is very important to me.
’ With a collection of ambient mu-
sic at my disposal and the surpris-
ingly-comfortable glow of-Christ-
mas lights, my room functions as a
decompression chamber. A day’s
worth of tensions throwing a party
in my stiff neck get carded and
have to go away. (It is thus unfor-
tunate for me that my next-door
neighbors have recently purchased

a high-powered stereo system. I

fully support their right to enjoy
whatever they desire, but perhaps
the bass lines of the same two or
three songs repeatedly rattling any-
thing not bolted down—not to men-
tion my nerves—is somewhat in-
trusive.)

An environment of solitude
and silence is a semiprecious com-
modity, and must be experienced
with relish. With this in mind, I try
to remind myself every day that I
am extremely fortunate to a havea
place to go to where I can ask the
world to step outside and leave me
alone for a little while. And if I
want, I can exercise at any time my
. option to rejoin the kind and
friendly Davidson atmosphere.

I leave you with the recipe for
an experiment. If possible, wait
until your roommate has a class
and make yourself comfortable in
your room. :

Light some candles or even
some incense (be careful ... people
may think you’re doing drugs).
Turn off your telephone (there’s a
little button on the side of most
electronic models—don’t worry,
voice mail will doits job). Turn off
the TV and just ... breathe.

Meditate. Nap. Do a jigsaw

puzzle. Read a trashy novel. Talk
to yourself, Stare at the wall. Or,
ifhard pressed, study. Just be good
‘ to yourself and enjoy any quiet
moments you can squeeze out of
one of the few crazy days we have
left in life.

common thread is woven in
the fabric of every human life, en-
twined among the other colors and
designs, tying its tint toevery clash-
ing shade. We sense its acute sheen
most clearly in the clenching of a
fist, in the thorns-that wont leave
our side. This tie that binds us
together is a lack, a need, a hunger
in the center of the chest; the occa-
sional hunger pains we suffer are
only a fractional indication of a
greater, world-wide deprivation.

Like infants groping in the
night for the touch of a caring
hand, we scan the Earth for satia-
tion, only to find ourselves more
hungry than when we started. Our
aching, hollow hearts thirst for
water to quench the ethereal dry-
ness. Sometimes we taste imita-
tions, but we always choke on these
bitter substitutes. We are like run-
ners after a long race, needing water
but pouring vinegar down our blis-
tering throats. What will finally
quiet our growling appetites and
soothe dur tepid thirst?

By the time we have reached
college, all of us. have probably
learned that nothing in the world
makes us completely and eternally

happy, yet we still desire complete
satisfaction. No creation desires
after something that does not exist.
Satisfaction, therefore, must exist,
or we wouldn’t want it. We should
learn, then, from the facts that we
are spiritually hungry and that noth-

ing completely satisfies this hun- ©

ger—except God, greater than the
world, who can.

When we seek God, we will
find Him. Consider the example of
Job when he finds God after endur-
ing undue suffering. Hear in his
words the sound of victory: “My
ears had heard of you,” he says to
the Lord. “But now my eyes have
seen you.” If we are to become
imitators of Job, practicing faith,
patience, and endurance, how
should we also interpret the rest of
Chapter 42, “The Lord made him
prosperous again, and gave him
twice as much as he had before.”
The message here is one of joy in
the sight of God. Christ is the
living water, and we are empty
glasses, waiting to be filled. When

God a soothe us like cool,

‘running water on a sweltering day,

I wonder why we keep subjecting
ourselves to sour milk.

Another example is found in
Dante’s Purgatorio, in which the
Italian writer summarizes the Ro-
man Catholic belief in the seven
story mountain in Purgatory. Pur-
gatory reminds us of our our need
for spiritual cleansing, which is
believing in Christ’s atonement,
which is seeing God, which is com-
ing to grasps with Divine Love.
Traveling through Purgatory, the
soul encounters and absolves its
sin so that it may enter into the holy
place of Heaven. The soul achieves
victory to the extent that it has
faced its sin and is there able to
belhold the Beatific Vision of the
Divine. Like the characters who
share in this experience, we will
also see the glory of God when we
acknowledge our guilt and accept
forgiveness through Christ.

These two allegories, Dante’s
abit ila and the book of Job,

reveal the joy and grace that pour
into us when we come into the
presence of God. Knowing God’s
willingness to forgive and desire
to reveal Himself in us, how can
we have access to these gifts? Jesus
gives us an example in Mark 1:35:
“Very early in the morning, while
it was still dark, Jesus got up, left
the house, and went off to a soli-
tary place, where he prayed.” We
will then understand Thomas
Merton’s definition of contempla-
tion as “the perfection of love.”
In the quiet times, we will find
that to follow Christ is not to sup-
press our passions but to experi-
ence a greater passion than any
other imitation yields. We cannot,
however, always stay on the moun-
tain; we have lives to live here. In
fact, we would be incomplete to
arrive at God and not to let His:
compassion overflow into other
areas of our lives, or not to want to
carry to other people the joy found
in that place. For this reason, the
same God that we see in that holy
place, where we taste of the living
water, abides with us through the
Holy Spirit when we return to the
dryness of the valley below.

This country seems to thrive on making African-Americans angry.

Why from page 8

were the first civilized people on
Earth? ‘Why weren’t we told that
the pyramids in Egypt were built
by dark-skinned people? Why was
it never said that there is a distinct
possibility that Jesus Christ was
black, considering the fact that
ancient Hebrews were dark-
skinned? I guess that shows us just
how important we are in this coun-
try.

Why did it take a full-scale
riot to force the criminal justice
system to convict the officers in
the Rodney King beating, and why
did they get such light sentences?
‘Was it meant to suggest that A fri-

an-American life is somehow less
important? I often wonder: how

long it would have taken a jury to
convict if the four officers were
African-American and Rodney
King was white.

This country seems to thrive *
on making African-Americans an-
gry. Then it condemns them for
speaking out against the many
wrong doings. It seems that if we
don’t speak out about the wrongs
in this society we are killed off
slowly and collectively. And at the
same time, it we show any anger of
express our dislikes towards this
apparent oppression we are killed
off quickly and individually. But,
regardless of how you look at it, it
is pretty obvious that there is a
force trying to kill us off.

What seems simply amazing
if the fact that we are not yet de-

stroyed. It is amazing to realize
that of the African-Americans in
the work force, 65% are in mana-
, Serial, supervisory, or entrepre-
“ neurial positions. It is amazing
that the African-American middle-
class is growing at twice the rate of
the white middle-class. It is amaz-
ing that African-Americans have
over 500 billion hours of formal
education, even though they have
to get them in an educational sys-

‘tem which says nothing positive

about them. Isn’t it just amazing
that great writers such as Maya
Angelou and Ralph Ellison are
African-American? And it is al-
most inconceivable that an Afri-
can-American could be the num-
ber-one rated surgeon in this coun-
try, even though one is,

In a weird way, it all makes
sense. I was told that God never
gives anyone more than they can
handle. So, what we must realize
is that these people did not accom-
plish great things in spite of being
African-American, but because
they are African-American. What
other group could have endured
slavery, and lived to tell about it?
Whatother group could have turned
the worst part of the pig into a
delicacy? What other group could
turn their hard times into entertain-
ment as. powerful as “the blues”
and slave narratives? What other
groupcould take the word “nigger”
and use it as a call of affection
amongst their peers? Whether you
want to see it or not, success does
run in our race.

Attackers of the Confederate flag are often uninformed.

equal to the South in the Senate,
had some success in raising the
tariff and acquiring federally-
funded internal improvements in
the early 1800s, none of these suc-
cesses were of the magnitude it
desired. The only solution was for
it to achieve a superiority in the
Senate. Thus came the Northern
demand, in the 1840s and 50s, that
no new slave states be admitted to
the Union. “As many Northern
States and territories had laws pre-
venting blacks from settling within
their borders [As late as 1834, Mas-
sachusetts law prescribed a public
whipping for any black entering
and remaining in the state for two
months], it is unbelievable and
hypocritical to argue the North’s
motivation in keeping slave states
out of the Union was based on
moral principles (Kennedy).”
But the Northern scheme
worked, and by early 1860 the
North had achieved a majority of
three states in the Senate and was
about to admit seven other free
states, giving it an irresistable ma-
jority in both houses of Congress
(Bledsoe). Overwhelmed in Con-
gress, the Southern states began to

secede when Lincoln was elected
on a platform promising every-
thing they opposed: a higher tariff,
federally-funded internal improve-
ments, and the means to perpetuate
the South’s inability to resist such
legislation, namely the prohibition
of slavery from the territories, thus
preventing the formation of new
slave States.

Initially, many Northern news-
papers supported the South’s right
to secede. But then the Northern
economy, with its 18.8% tariff,
began to suffer against the low
10% tariff of the Confederacy.
Then Northern opinion began to
change and war was demanded,
not to free the slaves, but to save
the Northern economy.

On March 30, 1861, The New
York Times concluded an editorial
railing against the destruction that
surely faced the Northern economy
if it allowed the Confederate tariff
to remain in existence: “We were
divided and confused [as to what
to do with the seceded Southern
States] till our pockets were
touched’” (Kennedy).

Nor did Lincoln argue that the
abolishment of slavery was his rea-
son for attacking the South. When
asked why he didn’t just let the

South go, he replied, ““‘Let the
South go! Where, then shall we
get our revenue?’” (Bledsoe).
When asked by Virginia officials
to delay his attempt to resupply
Fort Sumter, the event that started
the War, Lincoln asked “‘What is
to become of my revenue in New
York if there is a ten percent tariff
at Charleston?’” (McGuire).

We will never know the an-
swer to Mr. Lincoln’s questions.
Under Lincoln, the Confederacy
was defeated, and the North suc-
ceeded in enacting its long desired
economic policies: the tariff was
raised from 18.8% to 47.5%, mas-
sive amounts of Federal money
were spent on internal improve-
ments, and the spirit of the national
bank enacted with the Legal Ten-
der and National Bank Acts.

I hope that this will inspire
Mr. Bailey and the majority of
Americans who share his view to
reconsider their belief that slavery
was the central issue of the Civil
War; historical fact will not sup-
port this view. Furthermore, Mr.
Bailey and others should consider
that both free and enslaved blacks
fought for the Confederacy and

spoke proudly of their service for

the rest of their lives.

Finally, Mr. Bailey should
consider that the man at the head of
the armies fighting under the Con-
federate flag, General Robert E.
Lee, was an enemy of slavery. The
men and women, black and white,
who sacrificed, suffered, and died
for the Confederacy did notrally to
the Confederate flag to preserve
slavery. Rather, they rallied to itin
defense of the principles of the
Constitution before it was perverted
by an avaricious, industrialized
North, in defense of state sover-
eignty and of their homes.

Itis the KKK and similar white
supremacist groups that use the
Confederate, flag for their mind-
less, hateful activities, that have
most fully adopted the myth that
the South fought to preserve sla-
very. These ignoramuses simply
do not know the true meaning and
history of the flag they use. To
decry the Confederate flag as rac-
ist because the dregs of society
have associated it with their hate-
ful cause, is not only to judge all
decent supporters of the flag by the
lowest common denominator, but
is also to display a disregard for
history nearly | as appalling as that
shown by the KKK when it waves
the Confederate flag.
