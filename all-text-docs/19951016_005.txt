Campaign for

Davidson exceeds goal

The Campaign for Davidson, the
celebration of which caused such
controversy during Convoca-
tion, has officially ended.

stands $160.3 million larger.

Mayoral and city

council candidates to
debate at Davidson
Candidates for Davidson town
mayor will be on campus Octo-
ber 30 for a debate. The SGA is
sponsoring the debate in an at-
tempt to bring the College and
town communities together. The
campaign has generated some
interest because the incumbent
mayor is being seriously chal-
lenged for the first time in sev-
eral years, said SGA Vice-Presi-
dent Warren Buford.

Money Watch

Head Independent senator Brian
Luskey successfully petitioned
the SGA for $500 for the Inde-
pendents’ Homecoming party
held at the BSC. Luskey said the
money would go toward refresh-
ments, a DJ, and other inciden-
tal fees. The money was allo-
cated without objection.

Dave Derrick requested $80 on
behalf of the Student Advisory
Committee to the Director of
Residence Life. The money will
cover the cost of folders, pens,

and copies of the survey. The
survey will ask students what
areas of residence life need most

stained from voting on the mo-
tion.

SGA suggests |
improvements for ’97-’98
The proposed academic calen-
dar for ’97-’98 was presented to
the SGA for symbolic approval
last Tuesday. While very much
resembling the current calendar,
some senators suggested
changes. SAE senator Will
Cowan argued that their ought
to be a Sunday examine period
in addition to the usual six days.
He motioned that the SGA ap-
prove the calendar with a sug-
gestion that a Sunday examine
period be added for the Fall and
Spring terms. The motion passed
with five objections and one
abstention. The SGA approved
the calendar in toto with nine
objections and one abstention.

On October 3rd, Congressman
Mel Watt spoke in the 900 room
about his plan for redistributing
the 12th district in North Carolina.
According to Watt, the new voting
system would more fairly repre-
sent the African-American popu-
lation.

The plan to redistribute the
12th voting district in North Caro-
lina is described by Congressman
Watt as a move to create a’ more
effective democratic process in a
diverse country. “Few countries in
history have had such a successful
democracy in such diversity” says

Watt. Watt feels that the basis of —

this democracy is that many di-
verse interests work together, and
emphasizes the need to see that all
perspectives are represented.

Although Watt feels that the
United States is a successful de-
mocracy, he does admit-that “we
are not a color blind society ...
There is still a percent of the popu-
lation that is racist.”

The redistribution act hopes
to solve that problem by re-align-
ing the voting districts and taking
into account that a certain percent
of the population will never vote
for an African-American represen-

tative. The new voting system will
allow African-Americans fairer
representation in government.
Watt points out that African-
Americans represent approxi-
mately twenty percent of the popu-
lation in the United States, and that
they deserve to be represented.
However, Watt also adds that this
representation should not take any-
thing away from other voters.
Many questions arose during
the speech, some by the audience
and some by Watt himself. Watt
asked the audience “If a black man
is elected by a white majority,
should he answer to the people
who elected him or should he still
represent the black population?”
Although this appears to pose
deep racial questions, it was gener-
ally accepted that as a congress-
man you should not represent a
race at all but rather the beliefs and
platform that got you elected.
Another question that was
raised was how large a minority
should be to be able to have its own
district. Watt.answered that there
is no real number requirement in
deciding who should have their
own district, but that the decision
is based more on whether or not
that group in society is discrimi-
nated against.

memories of Davidson, including
shining shoes in a barber shop
owned by his family. Segregation
was still practiced at this time, and
Watt’s greatest fear was “getting
shoe polish on the white socks of

the Davidson students.” Watt left
Davidson during Sth or 6th grade,
not because of segregation, but
because the relatives he was living
with “forced me to eat spinach at
dinner.”

on the way out,” he said.

Westol said students ought to
ask questions about hazing and
pledging activities during rush.
“Ask questions. Be specific,” he
said.

Of even more interest to the
PCC was Westol’s comments on
risk management. . Westol was
briefed on the recent changes in
the Court’s risk management
policy, and said, “I recognize that
you have made some progress.”
He also noted, however, “incon-
sistencies” in the plan.

In order to meet their insur-
ance policies and protect them-
selves from lawsuits, Westol said

all Davidson parties should be ~

BYO, identify twenty-one year olds
with wristbands or-in some other
way, and offer sufficient amounts
of quality food and non-alcoholic
drinks as alternatives.

Westol encouraged the Court
to stop “dishing out alcohol to ev-
eryone who comes in.”

Guest lists also ought to be
used and enforced by someone at
the door. If a person is not on the
guest list, he/she should not get in,
Westol said.

If houses wantto protect them-
selves in a lawsuit, “don’t provide

alcohol to others,” Westol urged.
Students ought not be allowed to
bring one six-pack of beer or four-
pack of wine coolers.

Patterson Court President
Steve Shames said he didn’t think
Westol’s advice shocked any of
the house presidents.

Shames essentially: agreed
with Westol’s assessment of where

Davidson’ s risk management is and
where it must get to.

“We made some really good
progress, but still we are not really
covered by our insurance policies.

‘ And the only way we are going to,

get covered is to do what he says,”
said Shames.

Shames said the PCC needs to
“start establishing long-range

goals.” The Court has to be
“proactive” to diffuse and prevent
possibly dangerous situations, he
said.

“Within five years, it will be
BYO and guest lists on the Court,”
said Shames. “I don’t think any-
one wants to do this. But when it
come down to it, it seems that this
is what we have to do.”
