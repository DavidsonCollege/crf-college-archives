For an unrivalled example of hel-

company shown forth as a bright
and luminous light by deploving in
the face of a supposedly deadly fire
opened from the crest of a hill some ;
700 yards south of the road. This
was the second attack of the Reds,
and occurred a parrassany or so
nearer in to the college. Instead of
forming his fighting line on the pro-,
tected side of the road, the com-
mander of the reserve of the ad-
vance guard valiantly deployed his:
men in plain view of the enemy and
raced across the cotton field in an-
ticipation of a hand-to-hand com-
bat with the upholders of the crim-
son hue. The attacking forces, how-
ever, in view of the fact that the
cartridges were loaded with paper |
bullets in licu of the usnal metal
jacketed affairs, were able to prog-
ress some distance across the open |
country before the battle was offi-'

We all recognize that an educated
and inspired ministry, a loyal and
efficient teaching force, and profes-
sional men who are Presbyterians in
deed and creed, are essential to the
continued prosperity and power of
the Southern Church.

The ranks of Church leadership
must receive continual reinforce-
ment; and the vision that guarantees
the adequate equipment and inspira-
tion of that reinforcement, must
command our every resource to
realize and perpetuate it for the
Church.

THE MOVEMENT TO AD-
EQUATELY EQUIP THE
SOUTHERN CHURCH'S GREAT
SCHOOL OF CHURCH METHODS
AT MONTREAT IS MERELY AN
EXTENSION OF THAT STATES.-
MANSHIP TO THE WHOLE
CHURCH.

The fact that we have long em-
phasized the need of higher educa-
tion for the ministry much to the |
neglect of those whose early educa-
tion was inadequate, and of the lay-
men in general, cannot be denied.
We must regain our place as ex-
« ponents of higher education, and we
must, with a new vision assure that
the knowledge and inspiration of
our Church’s history, creed, and
practice reach every Layman.
Montreat is the answer.
