Baskin warned against

Student confusion surrounds
mis-named Goals Committee

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
News Editor

The Davidson College Goals
Committee met for the last time
Wednesday. April 25. The com-
mittee still remains to be con-
vened on Mav ist. but that
meeting will consist only of a
report by the Goals Committee
to the Board of Trustees.

The May meeting will be a
culmination of four months of
work by the Goals Committee in
grouping college developmental
priorities.

““Now that we have had these
four meetings. the committee
has brought some clear direc-
tion and order out of what had
appeared to be a _ chaoticly
established committee.”’ said
Craven E. Williams, Vice
President of Development.

‘  “After.a long wrestling match

amined

5-0 that the college delay the
opening of classes next year so
students have Monday off
again.

Senators Gutherie, Roylance,
and Shewmake were absent.

with self identity, the com-
mittee has reached a feeling of
those who established it. Now
the drafting of a report for the
trustees is in order. The sub-
stance has been agreed upon
and the» narrative is being
prepared to present on May 1 at
8:30.’ continued Williams.

Williams indicated that
although the committee has
lived up entirely to the ex-
pectations of those that founded
it. that is to group college
priorities that had already been
discovered in_ hierarchical
form, many people do not un-
derstand this.

“The first mistake was in the
naming of the Goals Com-
mittee. To have called it a Goals
Committee stimulates images
and scopes of responsibility in
the minds of students. faculty.
and the committee itself which
the trustess who formed it did
not mean.” said Williams.

Williams suggested that an
actual discovery of ‘‘goals’’ to
be pursued bv the college would
require a minimum of 1% mon-
ths. The Goals Committee. for-
med only four months ago was
never supposed to define policy.
The Goals Committee is respon-
sible for the implementation of
solutions to problems and needs

that have already been defined.

The definition of these needs
came about before the Goals
Committee was formed. Ten
years of self-study provided the
material in the form of a self-
study report that the Goals
Committee has been working
from.

‘The intention was that they
would be an implementation
committee and not a goals com-
mittee. They were to deal with
previously established capital
requests that had been presen-
ted to the college and decide
which of these were to receive
the highest priority.”’ said
Williams.

‘“‘We are not. blue-skv-
prophetic committee. Our post
was far more narrowly con-
ceived in the minds of the
trustees and that. the only
mission of the Goals Committee
was to suggest priority

grounings.

“The Goals Committee will
advise the trustees on capital
priorities for Davidson College
on Mav ? The Development
Committee will thank it for its
advice at that time and dismiss
it. IT imagine.”’ concluded
Williams

Planning committee pledges
complete Union by September

By JOHN WOOD
Staff Writer

“The new union will be, in
business next September; that’s
the pledge,” asserted Directer
of the College Union C. Shaw
Smith.

And that seems: to be the
general feeling around the
college.

The union will be moved from
the cramped Carnegie building

to the remodeled and spacious |

quarters of the old library or
Grey building.

timistic for a September
opening. Smith plans to move
his own office into the new union
along with several other union
offices this coming summer.

Despite previous talk of
finishing the remodeling this
spring term it has now been
decided that the union will be
finished in ‘full fashion’’ for
next fall term, according to
Smith, so that the union will be
completed without any com-
promise of quality.

‘‘We did a smart thing
deciding to do it full fashion,”’
said Smith. ‘The delay will give
us a better union.’

‘All the big things are done,”
according to Meetze. Most of
the paint is there and the
painters have started work.

The new union will include a
snack bar and dining area,
several conference rooms, a
student lounge, a tavern or club
house area, a large game room,
arts and crafts facilities and a
number of other rooms and
offices.

Decision making power
concerning the new union has
been turned over to a union
planning committee by Collegé
aaa Samuel R. Spencer

fs

“I think Spencer has taken a
great deal of interest,” said
Wassen who is also a committee
member.

The committee’s interests at
this time include the color of the
various walls and kinds of
furniture and its arrangment.
Meetze, Smith, Wasgen, the
chairperson to the Art Com-
mittee of the Union Board and
Co-curricular Committee
representative Lucille wW.
Schneider sit on this committee.

‘We welcome any input

anyone wants to give,” said
Smith.

The college has hired an in-
terior designer from a firm in
Charlotte to make recom-
mendations to the committee.

The budget for the new union
remodeling is $440,000. Much of
that has already been spent,
according to Meetze. He said
that there will be enough to
complete the union project.

“T think a fair deal has been
done,’’ remarked Wassen. He
added that the offices are
almost finished.

The union © offices. or
‘backstage areas’’as Smith
puts it, will not be as osten-
tatious as the rest of the
sprawling and colorful union
will be, according to Smith and
Wassen.

“The workmen were ready
but we weren’t,’’ admitted
Smith, accounting for some of
the delay, but added, ‘I’m
pleased with the progress.’’

‘The main thing is to judge it
by whether it’s ready or not,”’
remarked Smith. He said that
the faculty and students should
wait and see the union finished;
that criticizing now would only
slow the process.

Smith called Meetze the ‘‘real
magician’’ because he finished
the student store in time for last
fall term in the face of college
staff scepticism. Smith added
that all of the new union is
Meetze’s design and that a
great deal of the budgeted
money was saved by college
Staff constructing their own
fixtures.

Much of the work on the new
union is contracted to the
Barger Construction Company
with some subscontracted to
other private’ companies.
