‘The remaining 139 felt that

Question number four caused
much comment: “I would like
to see an unlimited cut policy

after a holiday. The penalty for
cutting these classes should be
suspension of all cut privileges
for a specified length of time.”

critical vein: “Future Home-

proved by having an artist se-

mentioned Dave Brubeck and
Louis Armstrong.

The appeal of two attractions

were very much opposed to the
double cut policy before and
after holidays.

Several students included
statements explaining their
views. One explained: “I feel
that a college student of suf-
ficient -calibre to eriter this
school is mature enough to reg-
ulate his cuts according to
necessity. It has always been
difficult for me to function un-
der a rigid system of restrict-
ions. If a student. cannot regu-
late his cuts so as to retain his
scholarship, he should not be
a student of Davidson College.”

FACULTY POLL

There were 39 replies to the
facutly poll. Of these nine fav-
ored the present system; nine
favored a stricter policy; and
21 were in favor of, a more
liberal policy.

Fifteen of the professors who
favored a more liberal policy
felt that some sort of unlimited
cut system would be desirable.
The remaining six professors
thought that more cuts should
be granted to students, the
number of cuts being deter-
mined. by grades.

One professor who favored
a stricter policy stated, ‘“Stu-
dents show poor stewardship of
cuts.” Another professor, who
felt that the present system
is adequate, wrote, “I have

worked under a liberal cut
system. It is not satisfactory.”

Endowment Fund Sets
Higher Goal In 1959

“While contributions such as the Dana gift help
build the College, the Living Endowment Fund runs it,”
said Mr. Robert J. Sailstad, Assistant to the President

The Living Endowment Fund
is a program by which alumni,
parents, and friends give an-
nual monetary gifts to the Col-
lege to insure continued opera-
tion. ©

Slightly over one thousand
alumni have given $48,639 to
the 1959 Fund. This, in con-
junction with the $33,866 pres-
ently received from non-alumni
parents, friends, corporations,
and foundations brings the to-
tal on hand to $92,495, short
of the $175,000 goal set for this
year.

in College Development.

SALARIES RAISED

College. faculty salaries and
student-aid budgets have been
raised for this year with the
hope that this goal of $175,000
will be reached. “Last year?’
as stated by Robert M.- Vance,
Chairman of Regional Solicita-
tion, “about 3 out of 10 David-
son men gave. This year, we
ee hoping to make it 5 out of
10!"

Last year only 29.9 per cent
of college alumni contributed.
This -year over 7,000 alumni
have not yet given. All gifts
for the 1959 Fund must be re-

ceived and pledges paid by
December. A Century Club hon-
ors a donor’s gift of $100 or
more, and an Underwriter Club
recognizes a donor of $200 or
more,

LETTER TO PARENTS

In a letter to parents from
President Martin a statement
reads, “If past and present con-
tributors had mot generously
provided funds for buildings,
endowment, salaries and stu-
dent aid, every student at Da-
vidson would be required to
pay about $900 every year in
additional fees. Last year, gifts

from parents totaled aimost
$20,000 and were a key factor
in keeping the college budget
‘in the black’.”

“In increasing student aid
funds from $119,000 in 1956-57
to $186,000 for this year,” the |
letter continues, ‘and in voting
a five per cent salary increase
for our faculty and staff, it
was our’ belief that our total
‘Living Endowment’ gift fund
for current operating - purposes
could be boosted from $158,000
in. 1958 to at least $175,000 in
1959.”
