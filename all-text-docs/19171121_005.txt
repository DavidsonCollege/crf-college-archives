Wofford comes to Davidson “thursday

DR. McDOWELL DELIVERS
ADDRESS TO STUDENTS

Dr. McDowell, who spake to the stu-

to try conclusions with the victorious|dents last Thursday morning in behalf of
Red and Black Wild-Cats. This game,|the Y. M. C. A. War Fund, began by
the first on the Hill this season, should |saying that now is the time for a man

be a very interesting one.
seems to be pretty strong this year, but
all the dope points to a conclusive David-
son victory. .

Undoubtedly Wofford has been play-
ing good football this year, defeating
with little trouble Guilford. Erskine, a
team representing a N. Y. Ambulance
corps, and scoring twice on Coach Dono-
hue’s veterans from Clemson. Her game
Saturday, in which she defeated U. S. C.
20-0, showed up her team at its best and
put her quarteback, Ellerbe, in the lime-
light.

Davidson is ready to add Wofford to
her string of victories, but expects to
have to play real football. .

For Wofford, the work of Ellerbe and
Carmichael usually features and our
team mar well watch them.

KING.

Davidson will probably line-up as last
Saturday. The Wofford Terriers will
line-up about as follows: Earle, center ;
Flowers and Kinney, guards; Smith and
Pearsun, tackles; Hammond and Bur-
nett. ends; Ellerbe quarter; Boyle and
Carmichael, halves; Vaughn, fullback.

All the student body will be out to the
game, Sprunt Field. Thursday.

DO YOUR SHOPPING
AND SHIPPING EARLY

More of “Our Boys" will be away
from home and family this vear at
Christmas time than ever before in our
history.

On account of the enormous volume
of war materials and supplies. in addi-
tion to the usual large movement of holi-
day shipments, it will require from now
on every available baggage, mail and ex-
press car that can be put into service.

To help the situation and to insure
Christmas packages reaching their desti-
nation on time and thus avoid disappoint-
ment, the public is earnestly requested to
ship their Christmas packages (whether
by mail or express) at least ten (10)
days or two weeks before Christmas.

This action will not only be appreci-
ated by the Government, but by the rail-
roads, whose already heavy burdens they
are trying to carry with promptness and
dispatch.

Norrork SouTHERN RAILROAD,

J. F. Dalton. G. P. A.

Wofford |to stand up straight and help support his

government with both shoulders. It is a
time when it is necessary to think in
terms of empires and deal in millions.
We face one of the bluest moments in
the history of the war and we have prom-
ies of it lasting several years. When we
begin to make the supreme sacrifice, then
we will realize that war is upon us.
General Pershing says that the thing
that will help most in winning the war
is morale. The organization that con-
tributes most toward creating a high
morale among the soldiers is the Y. M.
C. A. To do their work the Y. M. C.
A. is asking for funds. We were shock-
ed at the beginning of the war when
$3,000,000 was asked for to carry on
the Y. M. C. A. work. Now $35,000,-
ooo is asked. The first request for
money was almost doubled and the sec-
ond request seems likely to be oversub-
scribed. Mr. McDowell continued by
telling how this huge sum would be dis-
tributed. It is to be divided among the
Y. M. C. A. organizations in all the
fghting nations. Fifty per cent of the
$1,000,000 to be raised among the col-
leges goes to the prisoners of the war.
Dr. McDowell said that many — will
suffer because of sacrifices in order to
give, but many more will suffer because
they can’t give all they desire to give.
The speaker then told of the Y work
in Camp Greene, which is typical of the
work all over the world.

SECOND LYCEUM NUMBER __.
1S WELL RECEIVED

“Ye Olde New England Choir,” the
second number of the Piedmont Lyceum,
gave a very entertaining performance in
Shearer Hall Friday night to a large
audience of students and townpeople.
The choir was composed of R. C.
Simond, tenor; Miss Hazel Henry, so-
prano: Miss Gertrude Greely. alto, and
F. LL. Perry, baritone; with Miss Leavitt
as reader and pianist.

‘The performance was divided into
four parts: Ye Pilgrim period, ye Colon-
ial period, ye Abolitionist period, and ye
Modern period. During the intermis-
sion Miss Leavitt gave several humorous
recitations. Some of these were unusu-
ally fine and caused roars of laughter.

“Peck's Bad Boy.” “One of Job’s Com- |B

forters” and “An Auto Ride.” were espe-

cially well received. Miss Leavitt is one}f
of the most entertaining readers that has{—

heen heard at Davidson in some years.
The choir gave several selections that
were used in those periods.
tionist period was especially well receiv-
ed. Such songs as “Dixie.” “Yankee
Doodle.” “Tenting Tonight,” and

“Polly Put the Kettle On” were among |i

the best numbers. The entertainment
closed with a few sedections of modern
times. Al! the periods were presented
with dress that illustrated those times.
