The Daily Texan reports over-
hearing a co.ed remark to a passing
couple, “It’s a shame, I understand
they HAD to get pinned.”

According to tae Hastings Col.
legian a student at that college
decided to see if professors actually
read all the term. papers required
in a course. He inserted a para-
graph in his term paper stating he
didn’t believe teachers read what
pupils write, and asking the pro-
fessor to underline that paragraph
if he read it. The paper was re-
turned—unmarked.

Akron Buchtelite, University of
Akron, reports a new way for mod-
ern educators to knock down form-
al barriers between profs and stu-
dents. Fashion experts, says the

‘paper, suggest the faculty dress
more casually. For instance, a prof
who has an eight o'clock. class
should show once in awhile attired
in a smoking jacket or a bathrobe.

Comments

From the Ursinus Weekly, Col-
Jegeville, Pa—

“Prognostication Shows Altera-
tion of Future Strife in College
Life.”

From the Hoya, Georgetown
University—

“Should the day-hops who find
it necessary to remain on the Hill.
top after dark for evening meetings
of student activities be allowed to
eat with the boarders?”

Ed. Note: Sure. Those day-hops
should be famished after that long

climb in the dark.

From the Idaho Bengal, Pocatel-
lo, Idaho— .

“Shakespeare will make a tri-
umphant entrance into ISC dramat-
ics Tuesday ... when the com.
bined efforts of Alpha Psi Omega
and the ISC Players’ Club will
bring the ‘Comedy of Errors’ to
Frazier stage.”

Or an anatomy instructor could
wear a tie with a digestive tract
painted on it.

Ed. Note: This Shakespeare guy
is nothing but a grandstander.

University and college enroll.
ment for the spring semester has
declined, but many schools report-
ed today that the draft so far has
had less effect than anticipated.

College registrars queried by Uni.
ted Press ‘said some decline in Feb-
ruary enrollment is normal.

Most schools reported this year's
decline greater than normal, and
attributed it mainly to the: draft
and to military enlistments by stu-
dents who wanted to join the ser.
vice of their preference instead of
being drafted with out a choice.
Another factor was the graduation
of World War II veterans.

Some of the decline was attribut-
ed to the greater availability of
jobs as a result of the defense pro.
gram.

Most schools reported no increase

jin tuition fees or reduction in

faculties or curriculums. Some
schools, however, planned tuition
increases next fall.

A spot check showed the fol-
lowing trends:

Duke—Officials said there was
“no effect at all so far,” and that
“the announced policy of letting
students stay to the end of the year
and still choose their branch of
military service has ‘calmed fears.”

Vanderbilt — No noticeable draft
effects were reported, although en-
roliment for the winter term was
2,974 compared with 3,229 for the
same period last year. A few in-
structors had left for military ser-
vice.

From the Eastern ‘State News,
Eastern IIlinois State College—

“One of the tragedies in this age
of unreason is the plight of the
4.F, the man who because of ‘some
physical defect finds it impossible
to become a member of one of the
armed forces,”

Young Americans. will have to
take a longer look at their career
plans these days, according to Carl
A. Sauer, assistant to the presi-
dent of the American Institute for
Foreign Trade.

“We Americans will have to come
to a personal philosophy and ad-
justment to possible eventualities
without losing sight of our indi-
vidual careers and life-plans,” he
said in a memorandum issued re-
cently to students. This can be
done, he added, pointing out that

moral, cultural, and economic prob-
lems.”

Sauer said that the  stidents’
“best (if not caly) attitude is a
realistic but not fatalistic one: to
pursue his career objective with
calm and be ready to accomodate in
his plans a period of service when,
where, and if he is needed. This is
not ‘business as usual’; it is a long-
‘term assurance for the continuous
development of the nation’s intel-
lectual, professional ,commercial,
industrial, and military manpower
resources.”

Sauer told students that “out of
the welter of discussion and con
fusion, a national manpower policy
is slowly being forged. Only the }|———
broad outlines are discernible now,
but the final plan will no doubt
include some of the following ele-
ments: apportionment of young men

Continued schooling Sauer said,
would give a young man that much
more “educational capital in his
personal career account.”

The individual student is best
advised when he decides to get all

now, particularly the kind of ca-
reer-preparation we offer at AIFT.”
