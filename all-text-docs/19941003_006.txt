This Week in Washington .
Clinton suffers defeat on health care

By Andrea Short

President and Mrs. Clinton’s
most visible issue, goverriment-
controlled health care, died this
week in Congress. Senate Major-
ity Leader George Mitchell, who
declined Clinton’s offer of a Su-
preme Court seat, expressed regret
over the stalemate. Health care
proponents are already planning
legislative strategy for the next
Congress.

Experts cite two major points
that hurt the legislation’s chances:

mandatory buying alliances and °

requiring employers to pay their
employees’ health insurance. The
strategy for passing health care
legislation in the next Congres-
sional session relies on paring down
the bill considerably. Hillary
Rodham Clinton met with advi-

sors this week to discuss how to
best package the legislation: Chil-
dren, rather than universal cover-
age, may headline the calls for
reform next year. Congressional
members and experts have also
indicated that a plan born within
Congress, rather than a “Clinton
Plan,” will have a better chance of
survival. Distancing himself from
any specific legislation would also
mitigate the political costs if re-
form fails to happen. Clinton has
already suffered in the polls, and
this defeat may-hurt Democrats
running for reelection this Novem-
ber.

Washington expects a more
conservative crowd will convene

‘for the next Congress, possibly

making health care reform even
more difficult. Proponents may

introduce health care as a fiscal,
rather than social welfare, issue;
this approach would garner more
support as a deficit-reducing issue
than as one proposing government
growth. The administration’s
agenda will include welfare re-
form, deficit reduction, and na-
tional investment as well as the
revised health care plan.

Health care reform sparked
heavily partisan politics in Con-
gress. Senator Minority Leader
Bob Dole led the Republican at-
tack, claiming that the American
people did not want Congress to
adopt legislation without thought-
ful debate and planning. Dole
butted heads with New England
Democratic Senators Mitchell and
Kennedy. Mitchell denounced
Republicans and interest groups
that opposed health care, saying
that they had selfishly failed the
American people. Even though
health care reform will return to
the table next year, the Democrats
will lose Mitchell, the Democratic
ring-leader, when he retires after
this term. Kennedy faces his tough-
est election yet this November,
prompting many to predict the
Democrats will lose the long-time
health care proponent.

As the curtain falls on health
care and this Congress, party bick-
ering continues. House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt pointed
his finger at the Republicans;
“With very few exceptions, Re-
publicans cannot look their con-
stituents in the eye and say they
made a good-faith effort to give
health security to every Ameri-
can.” However, they have been
quick to refute the Democrats who
are claiming this example epito-
mizes the selfish party politics that
causes gridlock. Haley Barbour,
Republican National Committee
Chairman, denied that his party
had failed the American people.
“This process made the public very
afraid of half-baked, poorly
thought-out proposals that may
well do more harm than good.”

The best indicator of which
party the people felt best repre-
sented them, however, will come
in November when they visit the

polls.

Bosnia headed for a cold

winter as West watches

By Graham Ernst

Last Tuesday, Bosnian Presi-
dent Alija Izetbetgovic agreed to
delay his request to the United
Nations for an end to the three-
year-old international arms em-
bargo on the former Yugoslavian
republics. Unfortunately for
Bosnia, this concession comes as
Serbian forces tighten their
stranglehold on Sarajevo by clos-
ing the capital’s only access road,
shutting off all running water and
electricity and threatening to shoot
down any relief planes.

Izetbetgovic’s lack of support
in the UN Security Council was
the primary-reason for the delay of
his proposal, which would supply
his government with arms to fight
back against the well-equipped
Serbs.

Great Britain and France, who
both have troops serving in Bosnia-
Herzegovina as UN peacekeepers,
refused to support lifting the arms
embargo fearing that such action
would escalate the conflict.

President Clinton, feeling
pressure from the Senate to lift the
embargo, and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, knowing that right-
wing factions in Russia are still
allied with Serbia, could not agree
on a future policy for Bosnia last
week during their summit in Wash-
ington.

Because Serbian President
Milosovic controlled the military
when the civil war broke out dur-
ing the summer of 1991,
Yugoslavia’s military resources
were allocated to Serb forces, giv-
ing them a great advantage over
their ethnic enemies. As a result,
lifting the arms embargo would
allow the Bosnians, Croats, and
Muslims to better defend them-
selves in this one-sided war.

To this point, the UN has

proven to be ineffective in bring-
ing about a settlement to this con-
flict. Resolution 46/242 called for
a peaceful resolution to the con-
flict in August of 1992, and Reso-
lution 1992/S-2/1 denounced and
called for an end to Serbian human
rights abuses and ethnic cleansing.
However, theses “calls” have fallen
upon deaf ears as UN troops have
made almost no progress to these
ends. Also, Sarajevo and Gorazde
had already been destroyed by the
time the UN designated “safe
zones” around these cities.

The West has also been less
than helpful in resolving this con-
flict. Despite NATO’s continued -
threats to take action against Serbs
if peace accords were not followed,
Serb forces have only lost a couple
of fighters and one unmanned tank
to skirmishes with NATO.

The conflict in former Yugo-
slavia has roots dating back to Nazi
and Communist factions in this
region prior to WWII. The Roman
Catholic Croats, Sunni Muslims,
and Eastern Orthodox Serbs differ
inreligion, language, tradition, and
culture. As the international com-
munity struggles to agree on a
policy for Bosnia-Herzegovina, it
becomes apparent that there will
not be peace until the warring fac-
tions come to a common agree-
ment based on their own interests
of self-determination and demo-
graphic sovereignty.
