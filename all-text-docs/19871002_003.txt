before congressional investigate
committees. Woodward, who had
enjoyed an unusual amount of per-
sonal access to Casey, is being
criticized for exposing CIA spy-
ing techniques and for publishing
false information in his book
VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA.
Woodward claims that on his
deathbed Casey nodded affirma-
tion of his knowledge of the diver-
sion of funds to the Contras.
