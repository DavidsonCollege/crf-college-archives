Trustees meet, discuss statement of purpose, trustee panicy

By Mary Clare Jalonick

Last week, in the second of
three meetings for the 1993-94
school year, the board of trustees
met to discuss important issues
facing the students, faculty, and
administration.

The trustees reviewed several
major issues at the final plenary
session on Friday, including the
new statement of purpose and the
mandatory requirement that board
members be active member of a
Christian church.

A revised statement of pur-
pose was proposed and put on the
table for consideration at the April
meeting.

According to SGA president
Alden Smith, the most important
part of the two-day session was the
presentation of a joint resolution
between the SGA and the faculty.
Theresolution encourages the trust-
ees to reconsider the requirement
for trustees to be active members
of the Christian church. Smith
says, “I think that Davidson is tak-
ing a big step forward with the first

joint faculty-student resolution.”

The visiting trustees had a full
schedule. After orientation for the
new trustees on Thursday, the board
broke up into committees. Each of
these individual groups then made
a presentation at the plenary ses-
sion on Friday.

The committees, which are
each made up of board members
and a faculty liaison, include Ad-
missions and Financial Aid, Cam-
pus and Religious Life; Academic
and Educational Policy, Institu-
tional Advancement, Buildings and
Grounds, Athletic Policy, and Fi-
nance and Budget.

Thursday night, the board had
a reception and a dinner to honor
Davidson scholarship winners.
Scholarship donors were also in-
vited so that recipients could meet
their sponsors. President Kuyken-
dall talked to the group, and around
20 students put on a skit.

Smith seems pleased with the
outcome of the two-day meeting.
“It made for some interesting is-
sues.”

Solidarity week to focus on diversity

By Phoebe Dean

A KKK march held on
Davidson’s Main Street in the mid
1980s inspired Davidson students
to start an annual Solidarity Week.
The week continues the effort to
heighten appreciation for cultural
diversity and to bring the college
community together through a
week-long series of informative
and entertaining programs.

The Solidarity Week Plan-
ning Committee has been working
since November to schedule a
wider range of events for Solidar-
ity Week 1994. In Vail Commons,
students will be able to try eating
with chopsticks.

Senior Suneya Gupta will host
Mexican and German cooking
workshops for students, faculty,
and staff February 13-15. The
theme of a third workshop is pend-
ing.

: In the Union Conversation Pit
on Monday, February 14, a doc-
toral candidate from the Univer-

sity of Virginia will share a user-
friendly computer program de-
signed to help people learn about
minority groups.

Other Solidarity Week events
include Imported Beer Night,
which will replace the usual 21-
Year-Old Night on Tuesday, Feb-
ruary 15.

‘The Women’s Issues Dinner
and a “Dating at Davidson” panel
discussion will be on Wednesday,
February 16; a wine and cheese
tasting and discussion of art cen-
sorship with Professor Shaw Smith
on Thursday, February 17; a South-
ern Traditions Friday Afternoon
Club on February 18.

The Jumpin’ Java
Coffeehousewill host a compact
disc exchange extravaganza in the
Union Outpost on Saturday, Feb-
ruary 19.

Cry Freedom will be shown
in the 900 Room at 9:00 p.m. on
February 18.

The culmination of the week’s

events will be International Night
1994, on Saturday, February 19, in
the 900 Room. International stu-
dents will share cultural and con-
temporary traditions from their
own countries in the forms of song
and dance.

Vincent Choo, co-chair of the
Solidarity Week Planning Com-

mittee, said: that the specific goal
of this year’s committee is to en-
courage “learning through fun” and
to replace formal lectures with
more creative events in order to
reach the greatest number of
people.

“We’re really pleased to have
such a wide range of events this
year,” said Sherry Malushizky,
Assistant Director of Programs for
the Union. “Thanks to all who are
making it possible.”

This year’s events are pre-
sented by the Solidarity Commit-
tee, the Davidson College Union,
Reach Out, and the Student Health
Center.

Baker opens,

Weight continued from page 1

open to all from 12-6 p.m. and 7-9
p.m. Monday-Thursday, 12-6 p.m.
Friday, and 2-5 p.m. Saturday and
Sunday.

The smaller room adjacent to
the downstairs weight room which
formerly housed the free weights
will now serve as a multi-use con-
ference room. The administration
believes that work study students
will be able to supervise more ef-
fectively if they have only one
room to watch.

The weight room on the up-
Stairs racquetball court is open to
all students and will be monitored
by the work study student at the
front desk.

The administration has de-
cided to keep the football weight
room open for those who are seri-
ous about free weights and enjoy
working with the coaches. Stu-
dents who are going to use this

responding to

room must continue to sign up for
a time slot between 2-6 p.m. and
demonstrate commitment.

Bo Bartholomew, football
player and sophomore class presi-
dent, expressed concern that the
football locker room rather than
the weight room is overcrowded.
The availability of two locations
for lifting free weights should alle-

controversy

viate this problem.

Morrow stressed the adminis-
tration's willingness to accept stu-
dent input, “we may not be able to
satisfy each individual student’s
needs, but we will listen to all
voices and the majority will rule.
We feel that if students will give us
a chance, we can get something
that works."

When students received fly-
ers announcing the semester’s
movies at the Union, they noticed
a change from past years. The
Union will show such recently
released movies as Sleepless in
Seattle and Much AdoAbout Noth-
ing. Previously, the Union fea-
tured movies that had been out of
theaters for months or years.

Explaining the sudden
change to newer movies, Union
Board film chair, sophomore
Lylen Ferris says, “I suppose we
always could have [had such mov-
ies]. It’s really just supply and
demand.” Her committee meets
with groups of students to deter-

Union Movie Preview

mine what movies will attract
viewers. The goal in choosing
films, Ferris says, is “to keep di-
versity in the films and work
within our budget.”

Very recent films like The
Piano usually cost around $300,
while older films likeApocalypse
Now run cheaper.

With the new choices in mov-
ies ranging from M. Butterfly to
Boyz N the Hood, students seem
excited about seeing movies in
the Union. Sophomore Mary
Gilreath keeps the film flyer
posted on her bulletin board. She
says, “A lot of these are movies I
didn’t have time to seeorcouldn’t
afford to see last semester.”
