SPORT MAKES BID FOR
PEACE AWARD

(Special—Sporting Life)

The first friendly relations be-
tween Jugo-Slavia and Bulgaria
since 1915 happened on August roth
with the visit of the Nish football
team to Sofia. A precedent in the
athletic relations between the
Balkan countries was set by Bul-
garia recently in the successful
visit of the Rumanian football
team, Tricoulour, to Sofia, and
there will be a return visit of the
3ulgarian team to Bucharest.

Recently the first country club
and baseball grounds were estab-
lished by Americans in the Balkan
States, the seat of European strife,
and the Socialist Resistance
League, of Yucatan, has imported
250 American baseball outfits and
translated and printed the baseball
rules in the native language, while
they have dispatched a physical di-
rector to the United States to
qualify himself to supervise base-
ball instruction in Yucatan.

At last there seems to be an
awakening to the fact that clean,
swholesome sgort competition may
prove the most potent factor in
establishing a universal peace.

COACHES

The coach is the man who moulds
a football team, physically and men-
tally, and keeps up its morale so that
it may have the best chance to win.

Too often, a coach is blamed for a
losing season when the fault dies in
some factors over which he has no
control. The fault may lie in the
player who is unable to learn the sig-
nals; in the lack of adequate material
from which to build a winning team;
or in the support it deserves—but, the
coach gets the blame.

Weight is not everything in football.

Brains are necessary; and it is the
business of the coach to develop foot-
ball brains in men of physical perfee-
tion.

On this page are the pictures of five
coaches of the Carolinas. All these
have been successful in their games
with the Wildcats this year.

WHY I BELIEVE IN
FOOTBALL
By Dr. John M. Thomas

President of the Pennsylvania
State College

| (Special—From Athletic World)

| I believe in football because it
fixes in every student the spirit of
fight and the will to win. It is all
a mistake to say that the men on
the bleachers get no benefit. They
receive incalculable benefit in the
spirit that surges through them in
support of the team—the spirit of
determination and irresistible at-
tack.

I believe in football
fuses the college into a unity,
fore the first big home game each
year, the college is only a mass of
individuals, but with the long yell
that greets the team for its first
big fight, a new and living entity
comes into being. In the game the
soul the awakened
anew, and he is no man at all into
whose heart ‘the thrills of the con-
test do not send currents of devo-
tion and loyalty which will flow
till his heart no longer beats.

For these reasons, I believe in
footbail—especially football led by
big - hearted men, hard, clean,
strictly by the rules, and with
every ounce in the fight to the last
whistle.

Finklea guards one of the Tiger's flanks
and is a power both on offense and defense.
The pass on which he scored Clemson’s
touchdown against the Gamecocks was one of
the prettiest scoring plays. seen this year.
