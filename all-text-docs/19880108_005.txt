The Godfather: Coppola’s formula works (for once)

By FRANK LORD

When I think of Francis Ford Coppola,
‘the word “epic” comes immediately to
mind. In cinematic terms, the term “epic”
has come to be used in relation to films that
have a whole host of major stars, tend
toward unusual lengths, and cost lots and
lots of money to make. Sometimes they
even turn a profit. Therefore, it seems the
only appropriate word to use to describe the
vision of the man who produced such films
as Apocolypse Now, The Cotton Club, and
this weeks’ offering from the Cinema Clas-
sics committee: the first of the two films in
the Godfather series. Luckily this particu-
lar film is, in my opinion, one of Coppola’s
better works. .

I would not want to suggest that Apoco-
lypse Now is a bad film. It is not. It is,
however, aclassic example of the problems
that Coppola’s films tend to have. Running
for about three hours and costing approxi-
mately forty million dollars to make, itdoes
have some of the most amazing footage to
come out of Hollywood in quite some time.
In fact, the first two hours of the film are
particular favorites of mine. Unfortu-

nately, it all begins to fall apart when

Martin Sheen meets up with Marlon Brando’
and Coppola mires us all in his metaphors.

In the end, one tends to leave the film with

a bit of a bad taste in one’s mouth. This

makes it difficult to remember the bril-

liance of the first two hours.

Put simply, Coppola’s successes have
been spotty at best. Most of his “big” films
are sprinkled with bits of genius, but they
seldom come together to make a satisfying
final product.

The Godfather films are the exception to
this rule. They show us a Coppola whose
talents are really working for him and who
has not let things get out of-his control. In
short, the cinematography by Gordon Wil-

lis is marvelous; the acting by all invloved .

parties is remarkable; and the editing is
excellent.
The Godfather is ostensibly the story of
the members of the Corleone family and
their business of organized crime. One
might expect it to be something of a mafia
gangster shoot-’em-up flick. To some ex-
tent it is, but it also tells a story of men.

Understanding P.M.S.

Dear Confidential Health:

- — get irritable and tearful several days
before my menstrual period. Is this P.M.S.?
Can anything be done about this?

-M.B.

Dear M.B.:

P.M.S., or “Premenstrual Syndrome,”
refers to a constellation of symptoms many.
‘women have during the week before their
period. P.M.S. isn’t a disease, but it is a
group of problems unique to women in
high-stress societies. The symptoms. in-
clude lethargy, fluid retention, headaches
and irritability. Your symptoms are proba-
bly indications of P.M.S.

The body undergoes numerous chemical
changes prior to menstruation. Estrogen
levels decrease, progesterone levels rise,
and glucose metabolism changes. It is
thought that some of the behavioral
changes may be due toswelling in the brain.

The mostcommonly used P.M.S. therapy
is the administration of vitamin B6, in doses
of 50 mg. daily. Fluid retention can be
minimized by avaoiding intake of salt dur-
ing the last 2 weeks of the cycle. Avoiding
the ingestion of simple sugars minimizes
the effect of the altered glucose metabo-
lism. Alcoholic drinks should be avoided.
Finally, regular exercise improves stress
tolerance in general and helps P.M.S. pa-
tients.

For women who do not respond to these
measures, the doctor can prescribe medica-

tion to help alleviate the most prominent ~

symptoms. Mild diuretics, anti-anxiety
agents, and hormones may be of some use.

Though irritablity, fatigue, and emo-
tional upset are all seen in P.MLS. patients,
these symptoms can signal depression if
they last more than a few days. Do not
hesitate to seek medical advice if your
P.M.S. symptoms seem to last all the time!

Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino)
is the youngest son of the “Godfather” of
the Corleone family. He has just come
home from World War II, where he was
decorated as a war hero. In the beginning he
stays clear of the “family business” --
gambling and unionized labor. Gradually,
as a lengthy gang war takes the life of his
older brother and nearly kills his father, he
moves into the violerit surroundings that
have been the life of his family.

I was particularly struck by twoexamples
of cross-cutting -- cutting back and forth
between two story lines that parallel each
other -- which I feel are perfect examples of
Coppola’s genius. The first came at the
very beginning of the film, during the
wedding of Michael’ s sister, and the second
took place at the very end of the film, as
Michael was made the the godfather of his
sister’s son. In retrospect, the contrast
between these sequences makes the shift in
Michael Corleone’s personality -- his de-
scent from innocence into corruption -- all
too clear.

As an unabashed fan of Marlon Brando,

French Professor Lauren Yoder chats with freshman
Sabrina Khan before hitting the slopes.

Because of Iv Acc,

I must say is that his preformance as the

,Godfather is stunning. More importantly,.

Al Pacino does an unusually good job with
his role. Each time I see this film I become
more and more disappointed with Diane
Keaton’ s performance, but as her part is not.
large, her less than wonderful performance
does little to damage the film’s integrity.
If you are one of those people who has
only recently moved in from the hinterlands
and has not, therefore, seen The Godfather,
Ihighly reccomend it to you.-Itis one of the
few films of ;which I know that offers
something for everyone. That is to say that
I think a blood-and-gore freak could get the
same amount of enjoyment out of this film
as a “cinema highbrow.” (I imagine, how-
ever, that the type of enjoyment would be
much different for the two individuals.)

The Godfather. Directed by Francis Ford
Coppola. Screenplay by Francis Ford

Coppola and Mario Puzo. Cinematogra-
phy by Gordon Willis. Starring Marlon
Brando, Al Pacino,and James Caan. Show-
ings on Saturday and Sunday at 8 p.m. in
Love Auditorium.
