C. E. TRAINING CLASS IS
RECOGNIZED AUTHORITY

The Christian Endeavor ‘Training Class
of Davidson Colllege contributed an import-
ant part to the material used in the compila-
tion of North Carolina Synod’s new 1923
“Handbook for Use in Sunday School and
Young Peoples’ Work.” All the copy used
in the Christian Endeavor Department of
this pamphlet, the editor of which is Dr.
J. G. Garth, of Charlotte, was prepared by
the Davidson class.

This recognition of the ability of the class,
and of its authority in Christian Endeavor
work, is a well deserved compliment to the
members, The class is in its second year
of work, and now consists of 29 men. It is
perhaps the only organization of its kind

in Christian Endeavor, or a sort of super-
Christian Endeavor Society.
held’ every Sunday afternoon, and at each
meeting special phases of Christian En-
deavor work are taken up. W. Arnett
Gamble, Jr., who has later been made editor
of the Young Peoples Department of The
Presbyterian Standard, is the leader.

This paper comments on the value of the
handbook to the church in carrying on young
peoples’ work, All of the different depart-
ments of the book have been prepared by
experts in their respective lines, and the fact
that the Christian Endeavor Training Class
of Davidson College has been given an im-
portant section of the work, shows the high
estimation that is placed upon the work and
ability of the Davidson organization.

The following are some of the topics dis-

in existence, being in a way, a round course

cussed in the handbook by the Davidson
“Qualities of Leadership,” “How to
Organize a Christian Endeavor Society,”
“Christian Endeavor Organization,” “Chris-
tion Endeavor Expert Classes,” “Tonic for a
