Once, not so LONG ago, among
the YOUNGBLOOD entering these

there appeared a picturesque neo-

However, time passed and LINK-

Dr. Lingle also said that al-
though he was utterly opposed to
liquor traffic and had voted for

prohibition every time he had an
opportunity to do so, he was not
willing to heap malediction on his
friends who might think there was
a better means of promoting tem-
perance in North Carolina.
This Advisory Committee,
which Dr. Lingle is a member, is
composed of well-known educators
and citizens of North Carolina.
Among other members of the com-
mittee besides Dr. Lingle are Gov-
ernor Clyde R. Hoey, Dr. Frank
Graham, Dr. W. P. Few, Dr. W. L.

Dr. Cunningham closed his speech

few words. The poem was called
“Faith.”

Criticism of composition and
lighting furnished a subject for Mr.
L. D. Phillips, professional pho-

tographer of Charlotte, as he ad-
dressed the Photographic Club on
Thursday, March 4.

Mr. Phillips exhibited several of
his own salon prints, pointing out
the artistic schemes and effects. He
also criticized several of the stu-
dents’ prints, giving pointers for
producing more pleasing results.
Following this criticism Mr. Phil-
lips answered numerous questions
on many phases of his work.

The prints Mr. Phillips produced
were all of two types: flowers and
portraits. From careful
to grouping, arranging and illum-
ination, he had been able to
velop pictures extremely life-like
and full depth. Although all
were 11x14 inches in size, he pointed

Mr. Phillips stated that he con-
sidered the best inexpensive camera
for the amateur to be some small
machine possessing a ground glass
for focusing. “Miniature cameras

negatives do have to be enlarged,

Davidson Marker Is
To Be Erected Soon

Dr. T. W. Lingle attended a
meeting of the recently created
Commission on Highway His-
torical Markers. This meeting
is one of a long series of meet-

ings the Commission has been

holding to consider proposed
markers and their locations.
The C ission has di d

and approved a marker which
is to commemorate the found-
ing of Davidson College. Dr.
Lingle announced that this
marker had now’ been molded
and cast and that he expected it
to reach here at an early date.
It is proposed that the marker be
placed near the highway adja-
cent to the old Eumenean Liter-
ary Hall.

There are already some seven-
ty-five markers erected all over
the state and many more are up
for approval.

RED AND GAY TEAMS
TIEIN SCRIMMAGE

In a scrimmage game Saturday
afternoon the Reds and Grays
fought to a scoreless tie, each team
holding the opposing eleven on its
own goal line once.

Dennis was the outstanding star
of the game, making several bril-
liant runs. Bailey Williams, at end,
was a stone wall.in the Red’s de-
fense mechanism. Lafferty also
made several nice gains on jaunts
through the gray’s lines. Bob Abell
looks like the prospective varsity
center for next season’s Wildcat
eleven. Hand, another sophomore,
made some long punt returns,

Nicholson looks good at end and
is likely to see some varsity play-
ing next year. Benfield is another
end who looks good. Among the
freshmen showing up well in prac-
tice are Rice at guard and Miller in
the tackle slot.

Two former big league baseball
stars, Lew Fonseca and Roger

Peckinpaugh, visited the Davidson
College campus this past Monday.
They are traveling on a_ tour
through the south, sponsored by the
American League, in which they
show a baseball motion picture and
give fectures on the art of playing
good baseball. 5

Monday after dinner they were
scheduled to give their picture and
lecture at the Davidson Theatre, but
for some unexplained reason, the
picture failed to get here.

Monday afternoon, Coach Flake
Laird persuaded Fonseca and Peck-
inpaugh to come’ out and watgeh our

baseball team practice and to give
them some advice on good playing.
After a lengthy batting practice, in
which the players received a few
valuable tips, they gathered the
group around first base and dem-
onstrated the right way to steal
bases. They advised the team to
try stealing more on the pitcher
rather than the catcher. Then both
of them showed how to hook-slide
on either side of the bag, and told
them which side jo slide on.

Tuesday they are to go to Caro-
lina, and to Wake Forest Wednes-
day. From there they swing north.

Fonseca was a former manager of
the White Sox and a star third
baseman. Peckinpaugh managed
Cleveland and was a classy short-
stop. Both wén the coveted “most
valuable” award once.
