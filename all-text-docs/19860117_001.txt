Halsted advocates ‘sane nuclear policy’

By JOHN ENGEL

“Oh no, another political ac-
tivist beating his drum in the 900
Room” may have been the reac-
tion of many this past week to ad-
vertising for “How to Kick the
Nuclear Habit,” a speech pre-
sented by Washington consultant/
lobbyist Tom Halsted on the nu-
clear arms race.

The Union Speakers Commit-
tee sponsored a joint forum Tues-
day afternoon with both Halsted
and Norris Frederick, executive
director for North Carolina
SANE, the Committee for a Sane
Nuclear Policy. They also sched-
uled a speech by Halsted on the
subject of nuclear arms addiction.

In the afternoon forum, Hals-
ted and Frederick said the new
SDI program is the technological
lure which appeals to the Ameri-
can public but is neither a practical
nor feasible solution to the nuclear
arms build-up. They made an
analogy to contraception, in
which a “leaky shield” is no shield
at all.

Halsted and Norris fielded
questions from faculty, students

and townspeople for ninety mi-
nutes mainly on the issue of a
“Star Wars” defense system.
Other questions focused on the
momentum of the nuclear freeze
movement, the impact of money
from industry on the politics of
nuclear arms, the extent to which
we could verify a limitations tre-
aty and the attitude of the Reagan
administration toward nuclear
weapons, negotiations, and the
Soviets.

In another speech that evening
in the 900 Room, Halsted outlined
seven steps the U.S. ought to take
toward reducing the threat of nu-
clear war.

Halsted termed this year’s
summit negotiations as “one of
last year’s major nonevents” as a
result of “arms control being al-
most dead in the water for the last
seven years.” Despite the lack of
efforts on the administration’s
part and the apparent decline of
the freeze movement, Halsted
claimed that the: “polls show
overwhelming public revulsion
for nuclear weapons. Being such
great sports fans, we [Americans]

have a tough time accepting that
there’s no number one in nuclear
weapons.”

Thus, a Star Wars program is
immensely appealing to a public
always “in search of yet another
magic bullet.” He conceded that
“we need to keep some level of re-
search going,” but a program of
the size the administration is talk-
ing about “promises to accelerate
the arms race almost beyond con-
trol.”

Halsted said “If, to quote
Churchill, ‘the stone age may re-
turn on the gleaming wings of sci-
ence,’ and we are truly like ‘two
men up to their waists in gasoline,
each looking for more matches to
make them feel more secure,’ then
we may as well pack up and go
home now, for the specter of nu-
clear arms will not elude us with
or without limitations and. test
bans.’”

According to Halsted, the at-
titudes of both Soviet and Ameri-
can leadership must undergo a sig-
nificant change in direction if we
are to breathe easier. We must re-
evaluate our present course.

Tom Halsted spoke in the 900 Room Tuesday.

Incoming Union President Kellam outlines plans

By ANDREA DIEDRICH

Sign-ups for Union Commit-
tee Chairmen begin on Monday
Jan. 20 in the Union lobby.

The sign-ups and the inter-
views for the chairmen will take
place on Wednesday Jan. 22 and
will be conducted in part by the
new Union officers: junior
Lucinda Kellam, president; junior
Sheryl Aikman, co-curricular
vice-president; and junior Bobby
Houck, social vice-president. The
new Officers will serve during the
spring term of the 1985-’86 school
year and the fall and winter terms
of the 1986-’87 school year.

Because the drinking age will
be raised to 21 in North Carolina
on Sept. 1, 1986 “the new Union
officers will have to do some crea-
tive thinking in order to develop a
program that will allow the Union
to participate in the social life of
the campus,” Union Director Wil-

nside:

liam Brown said.

Kellam said one of her main
goals is to “program well enough
so that people will come to the
Union without being able to
drink.”

Houck added: “The Union
will be a social place; it just won't
be a place to drink. Hopefully we
will be able to concentrate on
other programs such as speakers
and films.”

Brown anticipates significant
growth in video programming be-
cause the Union has recently ac-
quired new equipment, including
an editor, that will enable greater
creativity in that area. He said
there have been several sugges-
tions such as a campus soap opera,
Sunday night home movies and an
Around Davidson news program
that the new equipment will make
possible.

“I anticipate that the 900

Room will not open when prog-
ramming isn’t going on after the
drinking age changes,” Brown
said. “It will probably be open
three on four nights a week and
will not function just as a gather-
ing place.”

Kellam said, “We plan to con-
centrate on having a few good per-
formances rather than having fre-
quent programming.”

Brown also foresees develop-
ment of the Davidson Outdoors
Program.

The Strategic Planning Com-
mittee will also be important in
determining the future of the
Union this year, Brown said. The
committee will address the ques-
tion of the location of the Union
and the possibility of changing
Johnston gym into a new Union
building.

Brown said a primary chal-
lenge the new officers (particu-

larly Kellam) have to face is: “not
to be intimidated by current Union
President Rob Vaughn's vision,
but rather to build on it. I see no
problem in her meeting that chal-
lenge.

“The last two boards have
reached out to the total campus
and created more interest in the
Union. We will grow and build on
what these people have done.”

Because of Kellam’s experi-
ence with Union activities, “She is
in a position to capitalize on that
better than anyone I can imagine,”
Brown said.

Kellam said one of her goals is
to involve students in the process
of organizing events. She also
plans to re-examine programs; for
example, because of the low at-
tendance at the Midwinter’s

dances in the Commons, this year
there will be a party in the 900
Room Saturday afternoon from 1 -

4 p.m.

Spring Frolics will include a
Speidel, Goodrich, and Lille con-
cert in the stadium followed by a
“drive-in” movie that night in the
stadium. Also Thursday night dis-
cos have been dropped because of
poor attendance.

Brown said next year it will be
especially important to coordinate
activities with Patterson Court so
the Union and the Court will not
compete. He hopes open conver-
sations with the social chairmen
on the court will be possible partly
to plan scheduling and partly to
determine who will sponsor which
events.

Because the fourth
woman Union president (Mary JO
Clark was the first in 1978-1979),
Brown feels Lucinda has several
advantages. He has found that
women have been very enthusias-
