Action Rally Features

Two Native

Hungarians

Two native Hungarians, one only three weeks out of
Budapést, revealed the grim drama of Hungarian suffering to
the “Action for Hungary” Rally Wednesday morning in chapel.

Dr. Szentivanyi explained the
maneuvers which enabled him
along with other Hungarian gov-
ernment officials to escape from
their native lard with the national
treasury.

The former Hungarian bank of-
ficial explained how 36 tons.of gold
worth $360,000,000, in addition to
numerous bonds and _ securities,
were placed on the floor of a train
fleeing from Budapest. To conceal
the treasure, it was necessary for
the women and children on the
train to sit on this floor.

This flight to freedom led them
to an Austrian monastery where
they hid the valuables in cata-
combs, brushing ancient bones
aside to make room.

Dr. Szentivanyi expressed to the
student body his deep gratitude for

making possible the coming of a
Hungarian family to America. He
emphasized the fact that for such
a family this would be the first
time in fifteen years that they will
know peace and security.

The young architect, whose iden-
tity was withheld because of a wife
and relatives still in Hungary was
introduced to the assembly as
“Steve.” Szentivanyi interpreted
for the patriot who termed being
in America a “good dream.”

Jim Martin closed the rally with
the reading of a petition to the
President of the United States
from the Davidson student body
urging action to aid the Hungar-
ians struggle for freedom. Students
were asked to add their signatures
to this petition.

Perkinson Directs
Gift Fund Drive

Gift Fund solicitors met Tuesday
night in the College Union for a
briefing by chairman Bunny Per-
kinson.

The fund received its first big
boost from a contribution by Dr.
Zoltan Szentivanyi, featured speak-
er at Wednesday's “Action for
Free Hungary” rally.

This year’s student gifts will be
worked on a pledge card system
similar to that u3zed by the
Y.M.C.A. Payments may be made
immediately or can be deferred
as late as January 10. However,
the Gift Fund Committee urges
payment as soon as possible.

Perkinson is aided in this work
by Ed Stuart. Together they have
selected thirty-eight members of
the student body to act as solici-
tors in this drive. These men were
chosen on tb: basis of interest
as shown by heir Y membership
activity cards.

As solicitations closed tonight,
committee officials expressed
marked optimism at the results.

VESPERS CONDUCT
IN MONDAY MEETING

The Student Council in a meet-
ing Monday night expressed the
opinion that conduct in Vespers
has become steadily worse.

The Council discussed plans for
improving the conduct. President
Dan LaFar said, “It is the job of
the Student Council to do some-
thing about this.” He also said that
the Council would enforce the
first section of the Student Body
Regulations, that “No student
shall be guilty of conduct unbe-
coming a gentleman and student of
Davidson College.”

After some discussion as to what
conduct in Vespers would be “un-
becoming a Davidson gentleman",
the Council decided that conduct
which interferes with the worship
of others would be so considered.
Students found guilty of violating
this regulation shall be punished
according to the seriousness of the
offense.

Radio Free Davidson was also
a topic of discussion at. the meet-
ing. It was the general opinion
of the Council that Radio Free
Davidson is not breaking the dorm-
itory regulations. On the contrary,
they consider these broadcasts a
welcome break from studies and
have received no complaints about
them.

Councilman Sonny Ferguson pre-

sented a petition from the David-

son Safety Council requesting stu-
dent cooperation with their pro-
posed safety program. In an effort
to stop speeding on Concord Road,
the Safety Council has asked stu-
dents to cooperate in this matter,
although they realize that the
Majority of the speeders are not
students. They also plan to place
crosswalks on Concord Road and
requést that students use them.

IFC, Faculty Study
Fraternity Problems

The Interfraternity Council and
the Faculty Fraternity Committee
have appointed a committee to in-
vestigate current: and anticipated
fraternity problems on the David-
son campus.

This committee, composed of
two faculty members and six stu-
dents, was organized following an
earlier meeting of the fraternity
presidents and the Interfraternity
Council.

The Committee has been instruct-
ed to study particularly the effects
of increased enrollment on the
present fraternity system. In_ its
two meetings to date, the newly
formed group has established a
sub-committee to investigate cer-
tain national fraternities known to
be interested in establishing chap-
ters on the Davidson campus.

The committee has also given
much attention to the fraternity
housing situation.

Several suggestions,
the construction of an entirely new
‘fraternity court in the area be-
hind the gymnasium and the build-
ing of duplex boarding houses,
have been made, but thus far no
concrete action has been taken.

HUNGARIAN TREASURY HERO

Szentivanyi Holds Key
To Door Forever Closed

By GRIER DAVIS

Holding the key to a door in
Budapest which can never be re-
opened, Dr. Zoltan Szentivanyi still
breathes the defiance of the Hun-
garian people against Red domina-
tion.

His eyes flash as he recounts
stories of Russian barbarism against
his country. His intensity is that
of a dedicated patriot, who, though
twelve years absent from his home-
land, is a patriot still.

In relafing some of his personal
experiences, Dr. Szentivanyi told
how, as an official in the Hungarian
National Bank, he engineered a
plan to secure Hungary's gold re-
serve when the Russians were en-
tering his country.

He vividly described how he es-
caped from his country with thirty-
six tons of gold and bonds and
securities, together worth over
eight hundred million dollars.

GETS 400 SIGNATURES

Davidson Petition Advocates
Increased Support for Hungary

Increased United States sup-
port of the Hungerien people
wes called for in a petition
signed Wednesday by 400 Da
vidson students.

The petition, secompanied
by an explanatory letter, is to
be sent to President Eisen-
hower, the Department of
State, and the United Nations.

Jim Martin presented the
petition to the student body
during a Gift Fund-sponsored
“Action For Free Hungary”
rally. The text of the petition
reads:

To the President of the United

Second World War.

| As interested citizens, we realize
the intense nature of the dilemma
facing the United States, one aris-

tary support of the Hungarian peo-
ple by the United States could well
precipitate the total war of which
all humanity tives in dread; yet a
continuation of our present policy
can only serve to alienate those
peoples seeking a leader, to whom
our attitude must seem dishearten-
