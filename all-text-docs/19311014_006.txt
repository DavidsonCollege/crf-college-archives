THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 14, 1931

Book Review ; |

Leonardo Da Vinci, Dimitri Merejkowski. Ran-
dom House, New York.

Leonardo Da Vinci is a work that marks
Merejkowski as a master in the art of letters.
The reader need not be surprised at the finished
touch’ that prevails throughout the volume when
he takes into account the fact that during his
*teens Merejkowski’s mind was impregnated
with mysticism and even at such a tender age
he had already written much poetry.

Now as to the work itself. Space prohibits
the use of quotations, and therefore only a few
of the excellences of the book may be referred

to. It presents a vivid picture of the life, man- |

ners, and customs of the Middle Ages. Leonardo
is indeed a veritable pageant, full of pomp and
splendor. It is brimming over with sly, crisp,
humor, a quality rarely found in the historical
novel. The reader gets an intimate picture of
one of the most remarkable
began. A

You realize that you are finding out secrets
about the great, the wise, and the unusual peo-
ple of that era. Men of various stafipns in life
during this time come to life in your imagina-
tion and pass before your mind’s eye, causing
your fancy to run rampant. One comes to better
understand the Borgia, Michelangelo, and, the
princes, popes, and martyrs of this period.

Leonardo has many parts that are really
poems in prose—like Cassandra’s visit to the
deserted isle temple of an unknown god. An-
other high spot in Leonardo is the description
of Walpurgis. The translation was done by
Bernard Guilbert Guerney directly from the
original Russian and is the only English version
in existence, Undoubtedly Merejkowski’s novel
deserves a high place among the great historical
novels and it will be well worth your while to
read the delectable pages of this interesting
work,

Barboursville, W. Va.—A youth who came
off a farm to enroll as a student at Morris-
Harvey College and who brought a two-year-old
steer, five bushels of potatoes and 30 bushels
of apples along with him to pay his school
expenses, was a full fledged student today.

The steer was butchered and the potatoes
and apples were in the college storage bins for
use in the cafeteria.

Unusual Tribute to | -
Late Mr. Wilson

Washington—An unusual honor is paid to the
late Woodrow Wilson here. In memory of his
life in the capital city, BKO-Keith’s theatre un-
veiled and dedicated a memorial plaque mark-
ing the box occupied by him.

President Wilson, enjoyed .vaudeville presen-
tations and was a regular patron at Keith's
|theatre during later years of his failing health.
People familiar with conditions and public men
jot that day recall scenes about that show house
;on the nights Mr. Wilson appeared. Crowds
| stood in the streets and watched him go in and
;come out, while hundreds attended the perform-
ances ‘just to see and admire the great World
War statesman.

Where Lo once was he ain't,

DR. ROBERT W. MILES

(Continued from pgae 1)
Alabama Polytechnic Institute at Auburn, Ala.,
for three years after he left the Seminary.
From that place he went to his present pas-
torate”at Lynchburg.

His church is very popular with young peo-
ple and attracts large numbers of them at every
service. He is active in the civic life and af-
fairs of his {Gity, and last summer was accorded
the honor of being sent to.Europe as a delegate
to the convention of Rotary International.

A change has been made in the plans for con-
ducting the evangelistic services this year. In-
stead of starting on Sunday, the first meeting
of the series will be Tuesday morning at chapel.
They will continue twice a day, once at chapel
and once each evening, through Friday night.
Chapel periods will be léngthened to 55 minutes
during the time Dr. Miles is here to give him
time for his services.

There are seven other districts, making thirty-
two scholarships available.

of Porto Rico spent the past summer attend-

the matter with Davidson campus tonight?
Everyone gone somewhere. Why? He doesn't
know. For what? Just to turn around and turn
back. We just love to go. As St. Augustin said,
‘Our souls are made for God and are restless
until we rest in Him,’

“He was a dilemma that is common today.
He lacked a soul. And when he went away he
lost the greatest opportunity of his life. The
modern church would have welcomed him into
its midst. He would probably have been a
deacon or an elder-in a very short time. But
Christ could look through the man. He saw not
God, but gold on the throne of his heart. There
is nothing wrong in riches, they become ob-
jectionable only when we are overpowered with
a restless worship of them.

“This experience is the experience of every
young man sooner or later. It must be realized
that all discipleship is costly. Christ must have
first place in faith, love, service, conduct and
character. This experience is not unique, for
upon it depends success of discipleship in
Jesus.”

portraits on exhibition at the Metropolitan Mu-
