flash of lightning between two clouds is ex-

!two opposite electrical charges for each
other. The affinity of the infinite for the

ling for God, trying to find out what He is.

fields of art, religion and science, Conscience
is only explained when the spirituality out-

side ourselves is recognized.

701 is through a sense of
“

tionship with
beauty. It has been said that
beauty is a joy forever.”
English poet, said, “Truth is beauty and
beauty is truth.”

The fourth, and possibly the most effec-
tive means of experiencing relationship with
God is through direct communion and _ fel-
lowship. Moses talked with God; Paul talk-
ed with Christ on the road to Damascus and
again when his ship was tossed by a storm
in the Mediterranean Sea, and, as a result,
the ship was saved. David Livingstone, in
the heart of Africa, lived close to’ God and
had a consciousness of God's presence. The
man who has/communion and fellowship with
God has a relationship and experience that
the man who does not commune with God
can know nothing of. This may be illus-
\trated by the case of the man who goes to
|the top of a mountain and looks out over
\the country. Things are unfolded to him
|there that cannot be conceived by the man
| who stays at the foot of the mountain.
| The speaker concluded his. talk by saying

in whatever field—art, religion or science—
is the mind of God being expressed through
| the minds of men. Only through God can
'man accomplish anything lasting.

| The song service preceding the address was
led by Joe Garrison, and a special song was
furnished by the quartet, composed of Piggy
Martin, Woodrow Wilson, Malcolm Lock-
hart, and Lowrance.

Who Knows?

That, in the football season of 1918
| Davidson won from Auburn, 21-7; and
the Atlanta Constitution of that date in
giving an account of the game had the
following account of the playing of one
of the Davidson stars: “Flowers, the
17-year-old Davidson halfback is one of
\the South’s most brilliant players. De-
spite his light weight, 140 pounds, to be
exact, he is a fierce tackler, a good line
|smasher, a brilliant punter and broken
‘field runner. All in all he is one of the
best halves the South has seen in many,
a day.” This was none other than the
famous Buck Flowers who was picked by
| Walter Camp on his all-American team.
He came from the same place as Pat
Crawford of baseball fame. In the same
year the Davidson team frocked Clem-
son, 21-9; Wake Forest, 73-7; Wofford,
63-0; and V. M. I., 23-7.

That, manual labor was once in vogue
at Davidson but it was discontinued be-
cause the boys broke up the tools so fast
that it was too heavy a drain on the col-
lege to replace them.

That, back in the time when whiskey
was pléntiful a freight train with a solid
carload of the choicest liquors was de-
railed near Mt. Mourne. Some of the
students brought some of it back with
them, and came near allowing one of
the faculty members to catch them with
it in their possession. According to some
information part of the loot was thrown
into one of the columns of old Chambers.

That the Davidson College Monthly,
the forerunner of the present magazine,
was this paragraph on the evils of dor-
mitory life in regard to young boys: “He
| becomes indifferent to the requirements
of social life, his sensations are blunted,
his tastes become coarse and unrefined,
(his manners brusque and unpolished and
he not only becomes careless of his
own self-respect, but he loses to a great
extent that appreciation for woman and
her influences, which are so important
in the completely rounded character.”

That, Kenneth Joseph Foreman was
Editor-in-Chief of Davidson College
Magazine for the scholastic year 1910-11.

That, the prize oration, as printed in
the Magazine that year was on the sub-
ject of Islam, and was written by M.!
Mar Yosip. This oration treated of the

growth of Islam, the éarnestness of the |

Islamites in the spread of their religion,
and ended with a plea to supplant Mo-
hammedanism with Christ.

That, this is not the first student gen-

eration that has been accused of wasting |

time and opportunities. The November,

|tice of medicine in his native community
for sixty years.

That, the Magazine celebrated its
twenty-fifth anniversary in 1910-11, and
contained
letters from former editors of the Mag-
azine. Among those who wrote to the
editor at that time were Mr. C. E. Hod-
gin, the father of C. E. Hodgin, Jr., class

Rising Sap Ushers In
Barnyard Golfing Game

All Students Are Enthusiasic in Old-
Style Sport—Red McComb
Practices

With the arrival of spring the “barn-
yard golf” season has started with a
rush. Everywhere over the campus can
be heard the familiar clank of steel
against steel, and atts of the fans are
watching their favorites. Every avail-
able spot on the campus that is suitable
to the game is pressed into service. The
game is open to all contestants, the only
requirement being that one have the
patience to wait for his time to come
around after “calling the winner.”

Horse-shoe pitching is among the old-
est games on the Davidson campus, and |
there can be no better sign that spring is |
here than to see the first games of this |
age-old sport started. One of the ad-!
vantages of the game is the fact that it |
takes only a short time to play it, and
hence it fills up the time just before’
meals and classes and also runs on int)
the night. There is a rumor about the
campus that Red McComb, after van-
quishing all oncomers during the day re-
cently astonished his roommate, McCan-
ley, and nearly decapitated that indi-
vidual by attempting the game out on
him in his sleep. McCauley was rudely |
awakened about midnight by several of
Red’s shoes dropping about his head and |
when he turned on the light was aston-|
ished to see Red on*the opposite side of |
the room calmly tossing his shoes in
the general direction of Mac’s pillar!

FRESHMEN FINALLY PRESENT
SWEATERS

In accordance with their annual custom,
the Freshman class presented the football
letter men with their sweaters and these were
awarded to the men in chapel Tuesday morn-
ing, March 3. Prof. Carl Wachter made a
short and impressive preliminary speech in
which he called attention to the significance
of the black sweaters, as a background for
the red “D” thereon. John Foster, presi-
dent of the Freshman class, then came for-
ward and presented the sweaters to the fol-
lowing men: C. M. Davis, captain; R. FE.
Boggs, captain-clect; T. S. Baker, all-state
end; E. H. Bohannon, J. F. Pinkney, S. W.
Summers, G. F. Laird, J. W. Anderson, H.
L. Vance, W. A. McAuly, J. H. McConnell,
N. E. Sappenfield, J. P. Hendrix, W. M.

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS
ENJOY SUNDAY PROGRAM

The Christian Endeavor Training class, |

with C. G. Davis as leader, discussed IWin-|

ning Souls for Christ. In carrying out the |
program a series of questions on the topic!
were answered. D,. M. Calhoun told Jhy'|
We Should Save Souls for Christ. He
showed that it was the duty and privilege of |
every Christian to win souls for Christ. F. |
K. Forbes answered the question, What is |
| the Value of Knowing the Bible When Sav-
jing Souls for Christ. In doing this he com- |
pared a Christian to a fisherman, showing
| that he must know the way to approach a
person and to act with him so that he may |
jwin him. The Importance of Being a Real |

| Christian When Saving Souls for Christ was |

| discussed by C. F. McRae. He said that in|

| order to have power to save others one must

| live a Christian life himself; he must prac- '

| method Christ used in saving Nicodemus to
that which He used in saving the woman of
Samaria, Phillips showed that they were es-
| sentially alike. Copeland told the method
| Christ used in winning Matthew, showing
| what unusual and sinful persons Christ is
| able to save. ;

| The society discussed plans for the Chris-
| tian Endeavor conference that is to be held
|in Charlotte this month. At this conference

| the young people’s work will be discussed.

| GOOD SHOES

| The conference will last perhaps only one
|

| or two days and it is expected that several of
|the members of the Christian Endeavor

Training class will attend this valuable meet-
| ing.

| “Wood, I saw some of your people
over in Charlot the other day.

“How did you know they were my
people?”

“One of them tried to bum a match otf
of me.”
