All-American Rating

THE DAVIDSONIAN received All-American rating
by the Associated College Press during recent judging
of 1964-65 first semester issues.

Cited for excellence in news
and sports coverage, editorials,
headlines, and photography,
THE DAVIDSONIAN amassed
3800 points out of 4500 possible.
All-American is the highest hon-
or rating given by ACP judges.

Although the inside news
pages, which were new to the
paper last fall, were criticized
for “occasional weaknesses,”
ACP judge Frank Wright called
THE DAVIDSONIAN “‘A superb

product.”’ John Todd, managing
editor last semester, was pleas-
ed by the rating. According to

Todd, now editor-in-chief, this!
is the fifth year in a row that!
the paper has received this |
award.

The ACP, which has its head-
quarters at the University of
Minnesota in Minneapolis, judg-

from colleges and universities
across the country. THE DA-
VIDSONIAN is judged only in-
side its classification by school

enrollment and frequency of
publication. Detailed scores from
previous years are not avail-
able to judges.

L. Richardson Preyer, former
Superior Court and District
judge and ex-candidate for. gov-
ernor of North Carolina.

Preyer began by speaking of
his first lessons in leadership,
during his first year at Harvard

law school. He remembered his

first ‘day, when the dean ad-
dressed the new class. ‘‘One-
half of what you learn here will
be wrong. The problem is decid-
ing which half that is.”

This, reported Preyer, taught
him a lesson in humility, as he
recalled Mark Twain's words,
“It isn’t what you don't know,
but what you do that isn't so,
that hurts you.”

He then talked .of a testimoni-
al banquet for ‘a man named
Williston, about whom you'll
hear a lot if you go into Jaw.”
During the course of the eve-
ning, several. important people
sang the praises of Mr. Willis-
ton. Finally, the old man rose
and gave a short answer ‘‘Nev-
er be afraid,” he said, “‘to ac-
cept responsibility. It is the only
way to grow.”

Preyer then pondered the
question of what the world will
be like at the turn of the 21st
century. ‘“‘We must realize how
fast things have been changing
in this century and how fast

they will change in the future,”
he reminded.

He quoted from Fortune mag-
azine that this country is a half-
finished society. “‘We have de-
veloped an immense material
empire, but are lacking in qual-
ity.”

“The problem,"’ Preyer re-
marked, “will be the pollution
of water and scenery. We must
find some way to control the
waste of these resources.”

62 Percent For Repeal ©
In Thursday Balloting

The proposed amendment to remove the drinkin
Constitution failed to receive the necessary
endum on Thursday. The vote was 500-297

This action by the. students
culminated several weeks of ag-
itation led by Honor Court mem-
ber Arnie Goodstein, who had
obtained some 300 signatures on
a petition which termed the
drinking rule “anachronistic”
and called for its repeal.

Goodstein was disappointed
that the amendment did not

in favor of
pass, but was encouraged by
the fact that a majority of stu-
dents favored the amendment.
He termed the result evidence
of a “pocket of dissent.”

“I see it as a mandate.” he.

said, “to continue opposing this
rule. Having seen the wishes of
the students, it is now up to a
student organization."

Council Stands In Opposition
To Amendment; Opinion Varies

Student Council discussed
the Goodstein petition at its
Monday meeting and voted
12-5 to oppose that pro-
posal.

Discussion of this controvers-
jal issue began last week with
David Powell’s motion ‘to en-
dorse the Goodstein petition.”
The motion was tabled until
Monday night's meeting. Will
Jackson countered with his re-
minder that should the petition

Lilly Plans

By HEYWARD CARTER
Davidsonian Feature Editor

For 39 years Davidson has
been the home of a mind 60
full of names, references,
cross-references, and a my-
riad of literary facts that. it
at times seems to belong to
the reincarnation of Samuel
Taylor Coleridge. Needless
to say, this erudite mind be-
longs to Dr. Henry T. Lilly,
Professor of English.

AFTER 39 YEARS

Lilly has proven himself many
times to be not only a scholar
and an educator, but also a
man who can communicate with
his students by coming down
to their level and inspiring in
them at least a part of the keen
interest he feels in nearly any
subject.

Rather than teach something,
Lilly tries to explain as would
one student to another because,

DOR. HENRY T. LILLY
“We're All Learning Together”

“You know, boys, we're all

learning together.”

He has been learning since his
graduation from Davidson in
1918, prior to which he had at-
tended Vanderbilt for two years.
After an eighteen-month tour
of duty as a sergeant in Brit-
tany during WWI, Lilly return-
ed to America where he got his
MA from Princeton in 1920.

Having taught two years at
McCallie School, he again went
abroad where he studied at the
University of Vienna in 1922-
1923, and at Oxford in 1923-1924,

Finally, after two years teach-
ing at Presbyterian College,
Lilly returned to Davidson in
1926 where he has remained un-
til the present. Since 1926 he has
returned abroad in 1956 on a trip
to Great Britian, and in 1958
on sabbatical to the Near East
and Western Europe.

Now Lilly claims the time has
come for tim to retire ‘before
the school fires me." Actually
he is retiring because, ‘It will
give me more time to study and
to read. In trying to teach I

Retirement

haven't had time to do these
things."’ Lilly is not known to
have ever referred to himself
as teaching — ‘‘Boys, you know
I only try to teach — we're just
the hired help around here."

His opinion on the subject with
which he is so familiar, litera-
ture, is that it should ‘‘broaden
your tolerance, it should deep-
en your sympathies, and it

‘should heighten your apprecia-

tions. I really enjoy trying to
show — “Look, boys, this ma-
terial is really worthwhile!"

As to Davidson and the many
years he has spent here he says,
“I really love Davidson and I
love the college. I have loved
staying here and the college has
been tremendously good to me.
These 39 years have been very.
happy years in which I have
enjoyed trying to teach."

In parting, Lilly would like to
leave all of his students with
these lines which he has follow-
ed for many years:

“In essentials, unity

In non-essentials, liberty

In all things, charity."

be adopted, ‘‘the faculty would
no longer be bound by the pre-
sent trunk rule: thus, Jiquor
could not be Jegally (or safely)
kept in one’s trunk.”

During the discussion after
the motion was taken from the
table, President Bill Council
stated, ‘If this referendum eli-
minates all student enforcement
of the rule, the faculty and
President D. Grier Martin will
strongly enforce it.’

OPINION VARIES

“I’m not sure that the major-
ity of students want a wet camp-
us."" explained Lee Fanning.
Offering a slightly different in-
terpretation, Paul Marion said,
“Maybe some favor drinking in
the fraternity houses, but not,
in the dorms.’’

Opposing any such endorse-
ment, Chuck Matthews com-
mented, ‘‘Students will lose the
security of having a trunk stor-
age space if this petition is ap-
proved.”

In support of the petition
David Walker affirmed, ‘It's
our constitution; we can change
it... However, he went on to
say that many of the professors
he had talked to ‘“‘did not favor
a change.’ Even if passed by
the students, he foresaw ‘‘dis-
senting alumni pressure to make
this a safe place for their sons."

Also favoring the petition,
Powell added that the penalty
of “categorical suspension fort
drinking” should be altered.

NO ENDORSEMENT

By a vote of 4-12 (with one
abstention) the council failed to
endorse the measure.

Fred Sackett then offered a
motion to oppose the petition
and then to issue a report to
explain the council’s reason for
such action. He said, *‘The, rea-
son involved is not fear of facul-
ty, but concern for students.”

Council agreed with Sackett
and added, ‘‘The faculty is hon-

BACCALAUREATE SERMON

Caldwell Set To Speak

Dr. Frank H. Caldwell, execu-
tive director of the Presbyterian

| Foundation, Charlotte, will de-

liver the Baccalaureate sermon
at Davidson June 6. He will
speak at 11 a. m. in the David-
son College Presbyterian
Church.

Caldwell, a native of Corinth,
Miss., is a graduate of Centre
College and holds a PhD from
Univeristy of Edinburgh where
he was a Humphrey Fellow. He
was a Visiting Fellow at Yale
and holds honorary degrees

from Centre. Maryville and
Southwestren Colleges.

Caldwell has held pastorates
in Bradfordsville, Ky. and Mc-
Comb, Miss. He was ‘president
and professor of Homiletics at
Louisville Seminary.

He is past president of the
American Association of Homi-
letics Professors and of the
Presbyterian Educational As-
sociation of the South. He is
vice-chairman of the Council on
Theological Education of : the

and a member of the board of
trustees of Rose Ann Hughes

tre College.

Country, and The Church Faces

estly trying to co-operate with
us in this problem.”

Walker then replied strongly,
“We should admit that we're
just scared of faculty opposi-
tion.”

An amendment by Bob Bryan,
requiring the actual vote to be
included in the council's state-
ment of opposition, passed eas-
fly. After the 12-5 vote on Sack-
ett's motion Jackson was ap-
pointed as head of the commit-
tee to draw up the formal coun-
cil statement and issue it to the
student body before Wednesday.

’ FRESHMAN RULES

In other major business Powell
who is next year’s Freshman
Advisor presented a plan for
altering the Freshman Court and
freshman regulations. ‘Since
these institutions are a farce
now, let's make a lot of fun out
of it next fall; maybe the court
could have wigs and robes. Any-
way, the point is let's takes the
‘must’ out of freshman regula-
tions."

Powell's revamped statement,
‘Advice to Freshmen, or Initial
Steps to Becoming a Davidson
Gentleman,” included seven sug-
gested members for the Fresh-
man Court: Robert Lake, Hoyle
Rymer, Basil Hicks. Charles
Goodykoontz, B. <A. Aiken,
Johnny Walker, and Andy Clay.

Following a short general dis-
cussion, a consensus seemed to
agree on “compulsory beanies"
but left such things as name
cards and attendance at athletic
events on a voluntary basis. No
definite action was taken.

NSA REPORT

Matthews and John Thomas
reported on last weekend's Na-
tional Student Association as-

reed

sembly at thea University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
Goodstein. the third Davidson
representative, was elected trea-
surer for the Virginia-Carolinas
district.

Matthews also announced that
George Brown, a Davidson s0-
phomore, has won an NSA scho-
larship to attend a study pro-
gram in Japan this summer.
Brown is one of only six students
in the United States to win such
an honor.

ATHLETIC REPORT

David Meschan reported on
the recent meeting of the Ath-
letic Council. He described var-
jous improvements that might

be made, including all-weather |

tennis courts and more hand-
ball courts.

He also mentioned that Presi- '
dent Martin had voiced his opin-
ion that participation in profes-;

sional athletics was ‘‘detriment-
al to the image of the school’

and that it let down the baseball |
team. Furthermore, he- called;

for students to voice their opin-
ions on this subject in the near
future.

NOTICE

‘Next week’s will be the fast
issue of the 1964-65 DAVID-
SONIAN.

Because of limited space,
news items should be submit-
ted as early as possible dur-
ing the week.

We regret that Letters to
the Editor submitted after 12
noon on Tuesday, May 18, can-

g rule from the Student Body
two-thirds vote for passage in a refer-

repeal.

Goodstein formally presented
the petition to the Student Coun-
cil on May 3. At that time, a
date for the referendum was
tentatively set, but the council
postponed taking a stand on the
proposal until its Monday night
meeting when it voted 12-5 to
oppose the change.

CRITICAL

Goodstein was bitterly critical
of the council’s position at a vol-
untary chapel on Wednesday
where he appeared with Hugh
Allen, who opposed the amend-
| ment. Allen is the former Hon-
| or Court chairman.
| “To want to clear up a few
_points.”’ Goodstein told the 200
| students present. ‘‘The real is-
sue is not a dry or wet campus.
I'm concerned about the hypoc-
risy of the situation, Thirty peo-
ple (Honor Court members and
Student Council members) are
‘honor bound" while the rest of
you are only ‘duty bound’ to re-
port drinking violations.”

He termed the Student Council
statement, which explained its
opposition to the amendment,
“trash... the worst thing I've
ever seen in print. The Student
Council,’ he charged, ‘decided
this out of fear and hypocrisy."*

NOT THE ISSUE

Although the faculty regula-
tion against drinking would still
stand, Goodstein acknowledged
that a change in the student
body rules ‘‘could mean more
‘drinking, but that is not the
main issue." ,

“The only thing that can come
out of this (passage of the
amendment).”’ he concluded, ‘‘is
a stronger honor. system.”

Allen, who followed Goldstein,
said he didn't believe that all
the arguments advanced for
passage of the amendment were
valid.

OTHER SCHOOLS

In response to thdse who
pointed to other schools which
have wet campuses, Allen said,
“It is false to assume that a
wet campus is necessary to in-
tellectual achievement.”

“We cannot.’ he continued,
“ignore the possibility that a
| minority of the students will
abuse privileges’ which would
come with passage of the amend-
ment.

He explained that he did not
believe the proposed amend-
