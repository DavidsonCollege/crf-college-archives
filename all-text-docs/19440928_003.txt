TITH THE
ILDCATS

By JIM LOWRY

Perhaps the most important thing to Davidson stu-
dents in the realm of sports is the returning of the Cats to
the football wars. When Gene McEver left for Carolina
on, a leave of absense it seemed as if the Cats were not to
be represented on the gridiron for’the first
time in almost thirty years. However,
Coach Shepherd decided not to let the sport
die and hired Phil Hudson, former Appal-
achian star who coached at Tech High in
Charlotte last year to handle this year’s
edition of the gridiron Cats. Due to the
manpower shortage it was decided to make
this year’s varsity only a freshman team,
playing only high schools and prep schools.
Coach Hidson issued a call for candidates last Monday
and around forty boys answered ‘but that number has
dwindled down to about thirty in the last week.

Discarding the single wing which has been so preve-
lant in Davidson football systems for so long, Coach Hud-
sO initiated the more modern ‘T’ formation, which is
noted for its deception, using this deception to offset the
lack of power.which the Wildcats seemed to have. Running
in the first string backfield so far have been Phil Edwards,
Gabby Bryant, Jiny Parker and Pat Patterson but the other
backfield is so nearly on par with this one that it is hard
to call one the first string. Composed of Neill, Keesler,
Inscoe and Hagan this set of backs has showéd up well
in the only scrimmage Saturday afternoon. In the line
the Cats can field a team composed of beys who have all
had prep school or high school experience. With Allison
Pell, from Darlington and Van Covington, from River-
side at the ends, the Cats have two valuable men. White-
house and Strickland are running at the tackles right
now with Monroe and Manget at the guard and John Hay
at the center.

The Cats have carded five games so tar opening with
Woodberry Forest at Orange in two weeks on Oct. 7th
and playing Barium, Mooresville, Laurinburg, and Dar-
lington. There is a chance that they might play Central
and that will undoubtedly be homecoming, though hardly
anyone would come home to see that.

It seems that there are two former Davidson students
playing up at Carolina this fall. They are Tom Abell,
who is said to have played at Culver and Johnny Walker
who played a lot at guard for the Davidson frosh two
years ago. Sam Hay is said to be playing but he wasn't
in the lineup Saturday so I guess he had a lab.

Seems like the race in the southern conference this
year will be between Wake Forrest and Duke. Carolina
seems hardly strong enough or deep enough in reserves
or experience to knock off the Blue Devils. Wake had a
lot of bad breaks and could easily have beaten the Tar-
heels three or four touchdowns. The dark horses could
easily be Clemson’s Tigers who romped P. C. Saturday,
or Doc Newton’s South Carolina Gamecocks who really
seemed to be loaded for bear.

At Charlotte Saturday night everyone saw a bunch
of high school boys try to stop one of the outstanding ball
carriers in the south. Charlie Trippi stamped himself as
one of the best backs in the service and the Third Air
Force as one of the outstanding service teams also. He
turned sideways and the Coast Guard couldn’t quite see
him. They could beat Great Lakes when they meet in two
weeks.

Despite the fact that Coach Hud-

everything is going nicely and our
boys confidently expect to win the

be no doubt of the team’s deter-

school’s staunch support. The first
game is always tough on any team
however, and it. would be nice to
see some familiar faces at Orange,

We are all confident in Hudsqn’'s
coaching ability and are looking
forward to an excellent season.
