Foglemen To Host Field In SC Tourney

By DON SEWELL
Sports Writer

Davidson's soroer tteam will play
host to four other corference teams in
the first annual Southern Conference
Soccer Tournament. Squads from The
Citadel, George Washington, West Vir-
ginia, and Furman will gather here for
the championship tourney scheduled for
November 17-19. |

Athletic Director Dr. Tom Scott ex-
plained that even though a conference
tournament was played Jast year, this
will be the first sanctioned conference
championship event. .

Coach Harry Fogleman, whose Wild-
cat booters finished second in last year’s
tourney, said he recognizes varsity soc-
cer as a “full-fledged conference sport.”
The Foglemen will open the tournament
action Thursday afternoon against The

Citadel.

Pacing the ‘Cats will be Captain
George Brown, Jordie Lang, and Mac

ing 11 this year are sophomores. They

ienced squad has had some difficulty

“We've played a couple really good
games,” Fogleman said, “but we’ve been
hampered considerably by injuries. We

strength.” The ’Cats’ record stands at

4-6.
WEST VIRGINIA

Coach Greg Myers will bring his
strong West Virginia team to the tour-
ney after closing out his regular season
with a 9-1 slate. The Mountaineers were
able to defeat such powerful teams as
Pitt, Penn State and Ohio State. They
won last year’s tournament, edging the
‘Cats in the final game, 3-1.

Leading the attack for the Moun-
taineers will be Nick Ivahnenko, Ron
McEachen and Bill Lanza. Coach Myers’s
squad is being considered for a berth in
the NCAA tournament after the South-
ern Conference tourney. Coach Fogle-

man feels that this team will certainly
be “the team to beat.”
CITADEL

The Citadel, a newcomer to the
sport, will be led by Claude Saunders,
R. C. Scales, Boo Adams, and R. P. Pad-
gett. Coaching this new squad is Lt. Tom
Froelich, who hopes to be a contender
in the tournament, despite his team’s
lack of experience.

“We have a bunch of good individ-
uals, and we hope to whip them into a
team,” Froelich said. “We'll give any-
body a contest.’ The Bulldogs, who be-
gan their soccer program only last
month, have not played any official
games this year. Their team, whose de-
fense is considered the strong point, will
play its first inter-collegiate contest
against the Wildcats in the opening of
tournament action.

GEORGE WASHINGTON

The Colonials, now in their second
soccer season, will also participate in the
tournament. Posting a 1-5 record to

Coach Tom White commented on the
tournament field: “It is doubtless that
WVU will be the team to beat. They have
their best team in years.”

Carrying the Colonial hopes will be

Saab, with several promising sopho-

mores.
FURMAN

Rounding out the slate for the
tournament. will be the Furman Purple
Paladins, coached by Pete Ashton. Pres-
ently holding a 3-3 record, the Paladins
beat Davidson in their only conference
tilt so far. Their team leader is Doug
Sirinek, an all-conference player last
year. Also outstanding for Furman are
Dave Mitchell, Jim Elwood, and Lou
Tate.

Dr. Scott, the man in charge of the
event, remarked that he would like to
see a large following for the contests.

THE VERY LEAST

This won’t take long. There’s not too mucin one can
say about tutors for athletes. What has not been said is
that there is not a tutoring program open to each sport,
but rather each sport must ask for funds in its'’budget for
tutors, a request which has not been made outside of the
football and basketball offices.

The idea that the sports which make the money
should be allowed to have tutorial programs does not
make sense. The minor sports practice as much as the
major ones. They do not have the opportunity in some
cases to practice at night to avoid drill and lab conflicts.
Ask Coach Harry Fogleman how it affects your team to
lose three top players to studies. °

If Davidson is going to have tutorial programs for
athletes, it should be an Athletic Department project,
and enough money should be budgeted to allow any ath-
lete who needs help to get it.

Most of us agree that athletic grants-in-aid should be
limited to the sports that make the money: basketball and
football. But for the evidently small amount of money
being appropriated to this project. it-is the least David-
son can previde for all of its representatives in the vari-
ous sports to provide tutors for those who need them in
order to compete. Needing a tutor does not mean the Ad-
missions Office has lowered the standards to let a jock in.
" means he is as serious about his studies as the sport he
plays.

Establishment of a department-wide tutorial program

is not spreading the subsidization of athletes. It is a token
admission that the minor sports are important in the ath.
Getic picture at Davidson. It is the very least we can do.

DEGERNDORF, Germany —
The 1966.67 Davidson basketball
season exploded early when “Die
Wildkatzen von Goethe Institut"
defeated the German army base
here, 48-13.

Playing in the base gymnas-
um, which doubles as a soccer
field, the 10-man team from the
Institute included six Davidson
students, two Swiss, one Nic-
araguan and an Englishman.
The game ball was described as
“a pregnant soccer ball,’ by
one Davidson student.

Refereeing the game were a
German and a Japanese and the
result was the use of “‘interna-
tional rules." The game re-
sembled a European handball
match, as the Army narrowly
missed four drop-kick goals.

Only three fouls were called
because neither referee had a
good knowledge of the rules,

The play under the basket was
a ‘goal line stand,’ said Mason
Stephenson, American defense
specialist.

Leading the scoring for the
victors was Stan Guest with 12;
Holmes Eleazer and Bobby My-
ers with 10 apiece; Henry Wil-
mer. eight: and Mike Fitzpat-
rick with four points.

On hand for the game were
representatives of 30 different
countries, the teachers and di-

FABULOUS DINING

rector of the Institute and about
60 members of the German
Army. Cheering for the inter-
national squad was provided by
two red-haired Irish priests.
Cries of ‘Down with South Af-
rica and Rhodesia’ by two
Ghanians livened the game.
After the game, the director
of the Institute treated both
teams to a beer bust, in which
the Davidson students were a
poor second.
