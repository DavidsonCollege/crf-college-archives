Sting Lets

By Tom Bavis

I could tell almost immedi-
ately that Sting’s new album, Ten
Summoner’ s Tales, was not going
to be a continuation of his last
album, the tense and somber Soul
Cages. In Soul Cages, he spent the
better part of an hour trying to
come to grips with his father’s
death, and the result was music
that fit the woeful mood of the
lyrics. Judging from the title (which
appears to be a play on Sting’s real
name, Gordon Sumner) and the sly
grins from the pictures within, I
could tell that he had not made
Soul Cages II.

Thankfully this album, when
taken as a whole, does not repeat
the formulae of any of his previous
work. Yet for all the experimenta-
tion on Ten Summoner's Tales,
Sting does not hesitate to dip
shamelessly into his past, both as
the Police chief and a soloist. The

His Hair Down on Ten Summoner'’s Tales

opening song, like 1985’s “If You
Love Somebody Set Them Free,”
screams to be played on the radio,
as Casey Kasem is already finding
out. Plucking his bass to the simple
beat, Sting complains of his with-
ering faith in the pillars of society-
-the church,, the politicians, and
the military, among others. He
concludes in the chorus that “If I
ever lose my faith in you / There’d
be nothing left for me to lose.”
Whether he’s talking to God, a
significant other, or someone else,
I haven’t quite decided. His point
is intriguing either way.

Though love initsmany forms
is his favorite subject on the al-
bum, Sting tries to have each song
tackle something completely new.
In “Love is Stronger Than Jus-
tice,” a young Mexican man de-
tails his shameless decision to kill
his six brothers for the hand of a
woman to which all the brothers

were equally entitled. In “She’s
Too Good For Me,” a man com-
plains about all the traits he pos-
sesses that the woman of his ambi-
tion dislikes, before he realizes, “I
could distort myself to be the per-
fect man / She might prefer me as
Iam.” And in perhaps the most
personal song of them all, “Epi-
logue,” Sting declares, “Youdon’t
need to read no books on my his-
tory / I’m a simple man, it’s no
mystery.” Compared to Soul
Cages, these lyrics are quite di-
verse. Atthe same time there are a
few allusions to familiar Sting top-
ics. The most blatant references
are in “Seven Days,” a Caribbean
ditty that alludes to at least four

Police songs, including “Can’t
Stand Losing You” and “Every
Little Thing She Does is Magic.”

This album is also a musical
departure from the often dry Soul
Cages. Sting has fun this time. As
if to challenge his own prowess as
abreeder of styles, Sting combines
a funky jazz rhythm in the verses
with a country chorus--and suc-
ceeds! In “Fields of Gold,” he
brings in Celtic instruments and
adds a nostalgic touch to an other-
wise mundane song.

But like the lyrics, there is a
lot of familiar ground trodden on
this album. “Shape of My Heart”
sounds frighteningly like “Frag-
ile,” a standout on 1987’s ...Noth-

ing Like the Sun. “She’s Too Good
For Me” rocks so hard and fast, it
could easily fit on one of the
Police’s first albums.

Thus Sting’s fourth solo al-
bumisneither his best work nor his
most consistent. But it is worth
buying — whether or not you are a
Sting fan already. If you aren’t
one, Ten Summoner’s Tales is a
perfect introduction — eleven
tracks that dip into many of the
sources of Sting’s previous suc-
cesses: pop, jazz, funk, rock, po-
etry, and philosophy. If you are an
avid Sting fan already, you prob-
ably won’t be disappointed; Ten
Summoner’ s Tales is Sting being
himself and enjoying it.

away from the Supremes, and what
do you have? A country revolu-
tion without Garth Brooks.

-If Garth does relinquish the

title (via either retiring, inactivity, .

or a further move from the main-
stream), who will be his succes-
sor? Answer: (drum roll) NO-
BODY. It'll be like the heavy-
weight division of pro boxing be-
fore Mike Tyson came along. . .a
big vacuum of contenders, but no
one will be strong enough to hold
bragging rights. Face it, Garth set
a new standard for dominance in
country music. Randy Travis,
Hank Jr., and George Strait never
saw anything like it.

-Does Matt give the best bus
tours of Nashville, TN? You bet
yer hoss he does.

-What is the best all--around
country song ever? Uh... okay.
Well, I’liname only afew from the
past 15 or so years. “Friends in
Low Places” (Brooks), “He
Stopped Loving Her Today”
(George Jones), “Are the Good
Times Really Over” (Merle Hag-
gard), “Good Hearted Woman”
(Waylon/Willie), “Angel of the
Morning” (Juice Newton), “You
Never Even Called Me By My
Name” (David Allen Coe), “The
Devil Went Down to Georgia,”
“The Dance.” The firsttwo are my
favorites.

-What can you do to make
Charlotte radio stations better?
Easy. Complain. This whole ob-
session (96.9 WTDR especially)
with “NEW” country represents a
really bothersome trend. If these
stations only play the big names,

_ shot.

Inatown like Charlotte, radio

programmers don’ttakerisks. The |

result is tremendous overkill and a
totally one-sided look at what

‘ Nashville has to offer. Listeners

here and-at stations like these all
