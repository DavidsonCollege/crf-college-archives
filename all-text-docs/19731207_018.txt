Coed Lockers Raise P.E. Enrollment

A new policy for the locker
room facilities under Johnston
Gym was announced in a joint
statement by Athletic Direc-
tor Tom Scott, President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.,
Physical Education Director
Chip Stone and several key
student leaders.

The new policy makes the
facilities including showers
and training rooms, co-

educational for use by both

sexes at the same time.

Reaction to this move
across the campus was very
well received indeed.

Several of the freshman
girls expressed their ex-
citement at being able to use
the showers with their male
counterparts.

One said, ‘‘This_ is
probably the biggest step for-
ward in Davidson education. I
think it is fantastic that we are

sex-barrier. We will finally be
able to get it on together.’’
When asked why the college
adopted the new policy, Spen-
cer indicated that he thought it
was “time all this nonsense in

tere felt that they have been
discriminated against and we
just got tired of listening to
them gripe.’’

It is a giant leap forward for
the college, which has been
suffering from the lack of par-
ticipation in physical
education activities.

Stone commented that “‘the
enrollment in P.E. activities
has already doubled in just a
few hours. Several people
have asked me if we are going
to switch to some sort of night

program so that people will physical
have more opportunities to
participate in the fun and

There was also an indication
that the consensus of the
student body would favor an

requirements needed for
graduation.

All of the campus was not
favorable, however. One
freshman was quite dismayed
by the move.

“I hate girls,”’ he stated em-
phatically. ‘They are all im-
moral and we would be a lot
better off if we just expelled
ay all. They are corrupting

diy fair to the female
population of the college.
Generally, they are well liked
by the men here.

The new policy will not go
into effect until after the
Christmas recess for several
reasons.

situation,’ Spencer criticised.

summer that there would be

Trustees Announce Policy,

Bender Gets Deciding Vote

The trustee’s committee on
athletics announced several
sweeping changes in the
basketball program at David-
son earlier this week.

“In order to keep a
nationally prominent basket-
ball program within reach and
to facilitate an easier at-
tainment of this objective, cer-
tain modifications of the
existing program at Davidson

must be made,”’ stated the
trustees’ written an-
nouncement.

Grapplers Trip To Uraguay
For Goodwill Summer Fun

The State Department an-
nounced Tuesday that the
Davidson wrestling team will
go on a goodwill tour of
Uraguay this summer.

The trip will be conducted in
a similar manner as_ the
basketball team’s trip to
Australia was last summer.
The team will be gone for the
entire month of July and will
give wrestling exhibitions
throughout the country,
wrestling against some of the
better teams in Uraguay.

“Actually the entire trip
would only take a weekend

and a half but we’ll be
traveling by horseback during
their monsoon season so time
has to be allowed for traveling
problems.”’ commented coach
Charles Parker.

When questioned whether
Uraguay would reciprocate by
sending her national team to
theU.S. as the Australians did
with their basketball team,
Parker replied, ‘‘I hope not.”

Team members’ were
generally enthusiastic when
they heard the news.

‘“‘Where the hell is
Uraguay?”’ said Charlie Dor-

‘the Uraguay Republic will
host a state dinner for the
team upon their arrival.
Following the dinner, a recep-
tion will be held for the team

Parker stated that wrestling
interest has increased greatly
in Uraguay during the last few
years. As a result, the team
will face some very good com-
petition during the trip.

“Those little guys can be
awful slippery, especially
when they smear coconut in-
cense all over their bodies in
those aboriginal tribal get
togethers that they always
have,’’ Parker said.

The team will be allowed to
enjoy some sight seeing tours
during their visit. Included in
the itenerary will be a visit to
the world’s largest coffee
plantation, where the world’s
largest albino coffee bean is
kept.

Tom Scott will replace Jim
Larranaga as junior varsity
coach while Larranaga will
take up a position as full time
recruiter. Present plans call
for Larranaga to devote most
of his time to scouting high
school players in the New
York City area.

Among the schools that he
will concentrate on,
Larranaga mentioned Ar-
chbishop Malloy High School
in Queens as the most likely
source of future Wildcats.

‘‘After all, Mike Sorrentino,
Tom Verlin, and myself all at-
tended Malloy, so we should
have an inside track there,”
Larranaga said.

‘Besides, if I show up there
enough they might let me
graduate this time,”’
Larranaga added.

The top prospects,
cording to Larranaga, are
Fred ‘‘Toadstool” Pallacci, a

5’7” center, Adolph ‘‘Ralph”
Spinelli, a 6’ forward, and
Harvey Fartz, a6’9”’ rapist.

“‘All three are really super
prospects. Stool is a real jum-
per, he can touch the rim
sometimes, Ralph is one of the
dirtiest players in the country,
and I guess all you can say
about Harvey is that he’s a
real go getter,” Larranaga
stated.

Scott was also pleased with
his new status.

“First of all, I’ve always
wanted one of the upstairs of-
fices in the gym, and with the
prospects that has
lined up, it doesn't look like I'll
have much to do,’’ Scott said.

Head basketball coach

over the new changes. Holland

made by the trustees will be a
change in the coaching
mechanics of the team. The
team will now be coached
through a_ parliamentary
procedure system.

Under the system adopted
by the trustees, before any
type of change or substitution
can be made in a game, the
coaches will vote on the issue
All coaches will receive one
vote as well as a_ player
designated shortly before the
game.

“It was decided to give a
player a vote in order to
develop the fine leadership
potential of the team mem-
bers, ‘‘ said Holland.

In the eventuality of a 2-2
tie, Holland explained that
time out will be called and Cat
mascot Dave Bender will be
called upon to cast the
deciding vote.

“Dave has really done a
great job for us in the last
couple of years and this was
our only way to show him our
appreciation,” Holland stated.

Bender was very en-
thusiastic over the new policy,
saying, ‘It’s about time they
gave me something else to do
instead of just running around
in that tacky uniform all the
time.”

Several players were also in
favor of the move.

“It’s a great chance to
develop our fine leadership
potential,” said Jay Powell.

It was also hinted by the
trustees that in the future,
faculty and administration of-
ficials will be called on to
assist in coaching respon-
sibilities.

“I just can’t wait to try my
4-1-4 defense,’’ commented
John Bevan.

“I think this will present a
great opportunity for my son
Frank,’’ stated another
college employee.
