Dick Gammon, Senior:

Looking at this question candid-
ly, it seems that a few improve-
ments could be made. For example,
a more personal touch would help
a lot. If the name of the boy who
writes the story were printed along
with it, he would try harder to do
a good job instead. of handing in
something to which he would’ be
ashamed to have his name attached.
Then too, it would give him some
recognition for his labors. Another
point which could be improved on
is a better covering of the news on

the campus. Many times things
happen here that are never men-
tioned in the paper. And

1 think that some sports.should get

lastly,

more recognition than they do—
especially the minor sports, which
..are.usually crowded, in. some corn:
er of the sports page and on the

sixth page.

Winston Taylor, Junior:

TI would suggest that in the make-

up, all the latter portions of the
stories should-not be on the back
page but should be mixed up
throughout the paper. Also thére
should be one or possibly two fea-
ture stories on the last page. An-
other good point would be to re-
move the “Wa't A Minute” column,
or else change authors. In some

cases the dirt columns make state-

ments which are understood by par-

ents, as well as by the students
for whom they are ‘intended, and
the result has been known to be

embarrassing.

Pat Rudolph, Sophomore:

After looking through countless
issues of The Davidsonian, I can
find no really major faults with it.
This is evidenced by its ratings in
national competitions. But to get
down to what would appeal to the
local instead of national judges,
there could be a few minor changes
and additions. For one, I suggest
the development of an intercollegi-
ate exchange as a regular column.
Use the exchange papers to get in-
teresting facts about other nearby
schools; what they are doing and
how they are doing it. Many of us
try to keep up with what -is going
on at Carolina and Duke, et al., and
this would be an ideal way to keep

correspondence.

Eldridge Brown, Junior:

“The Davidsonian” does very well

compilation. It has done pretty well

dence inaccurate
in the past in giving both sides of

campus questions, but sometimes

it-is slightly partisan, and I do not
think it should be so.
Jack Abernasty, Senior:
Naturally the biggest improve-
ment that could be made would be
to eliminate this sheet from the
Davidson collegiate scene. How-
ever, since it seems to be one of
the necessary evils of the campus
that there must be a Davidsonian
editor to fill up room 32 Georgia, I

do have a few suggestions.

Why not have a full page cut of
Chambers Building on the front
page of every issue? By the time
the year is out every boy could
have supplied all his friends with
pictures suitable for framing, which
is certainly a valuable and unique
thing. The gossip column should be
expanded to fill the entire editorial
page—that’s all any body ever reads.
I think stories about the dances are
simple and should be on page six;
if at all, with write-ups of all the
wonderful lectures we have on the
