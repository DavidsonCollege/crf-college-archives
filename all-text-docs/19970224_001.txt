Burk proposes ways
to spend extra $3000

By Mary Care JALONICcK -
Editor Emerita

Last month the Student Gov-
ernment Association (SGA) voted
to give themselves an automatic 5%
of the Activities Tax Council (ATC)
. budget. After some debate, new
SGA President Buster Burk will not
move to alter this policy.

He will, however, take his pro-
posed budget to the ATC and ask
for approval. Because the ATC is
an SGA committee and the SGA
has authority over it, this approval
will be not much more than advice.

Last year, the SGA received
around 4% of the ATC budget. Af-
ter tuition rises (and the ATC bud-
getalong with it), the automatic 5%
gives the SGA a 30% increase from
last year, or around an extra $3000.

Burk will recommend that the
extra money be split up into three
parts: $1000 extra for the four
classes ($250 each), $1000 for “‘spe-
cial projects,” and $1000 for the
new Rides Program.

He is unspecific about the de-

tails of this plan. He says the extra
$250 will go to each class because
they are all currently out of money.
He hopes the $1000 for “special
projects” will go toward coordinat-
ing events with the town of
Davidson, possibly a barbeque.

The Rides Program, which is
currently in the works and sched-
uled to begin this semester, will use
the other $1000. They will use the
money to rent vans and coordinate
rides to Cornelius.

“This gives us some leeway to
do a lot of good things,” says Burk.

He would also like to see the
extra funds go toward organizations
who petition the SGA for small
amounts throughout the year.

In an interview on February
16, Burk had plans to propose
changes to the budget increase. At
that point, he suggested a sperate
fund for the, Rides Program and a
minimal increase for the SGA bud-
get each year.

“My problem is that we kind of

Applications up by 12 %this year, Admissions says

By STEPHEN CEFALU
Staff Writer .

A record number of admission
applications have been received by

the Office of Admissions so far this -

year. The applicant pool for
Davidson’s Class of 2001 currently
totals 3176 candidates, a 12% in-
crease over last year’s tally. Dean
of Admission and Financial Aid
Nancy Cable says the rise in num-
ber of applications for admission
can be attributed to a steadily in-
creasing public awareness of
Davidson’s preeminence among
institutions of higher learning. —

“The quality of the College and
the dedication of its faculty unques-
tionably account for a large part of
Davidson’s allure,” says Cable.
“Credit also our admissions staff
for working extremely hard to as-
semble an applicant pool of the very
highest quality.”

287 of.this year’s candidates
for admission applied early deci-
sion, and 66% have been offered a
place in Davidson’s Class of 2001.
230 foreign nationals and a record
202 African American students have
also applied for admission to
Davidson this year. “‘We’re very
encouraged by the numbers.

Achieving amore ethnically diverse
applicant pool has certainly been an
important goal forus,” says Associ-
ate Dean of Admission Wookie
Payne.

Part of the reason for the growth
of the applicant pool may stem from
the Office of Admission’s decision
to accept the Common Application
form from candidates for admis-
sion to the class of 2001. Over eight
years have passed since Davidson
last listed its name among those on
the Common Application.

According to Payne, the deci-
sion was in part driven by technol-
ogy. “The Common Application is

very accessible, both i in disk form
and on the World Wide Web. It also
eases the burden on teachers and
recommenders who now need only
fill out one form, instead of stacks
of different ones,” says Payne.
Lest the Admission Office’s
decision to accept the Common Ap-
plication appear too overly oblig-
ing, the College still mandates that
all admission candidates submit
supplementary documentation.
This additional material includes a
character recommendation, andtwo
personal essays, one concerning the
Davidson College Honor Code.
“What we’ re noticing with the Com-

mon Application” says Cable, “is
that the percentage of high caliber,
legitimate candidates for admission
is increasing, rather than dissipat-
ing.”

_ The Admissions Office hopes
tointroduce approximately 440 new
members to the Davidson commu-
nity as its Class of 2001. “We’re
really in an enviable position,” says
Payne. “Students from all over the
world, who have lots of talents,
interests, and abilities to offer
Davidson are represented within the
applicant pool. This means for us
the strongest freshman class ever to
enter the school.”

German symposium: It takes a city
Approaches to the city of Weimar

By J. ALISON BRYANT
Guest Writer

Theatre, sculpture, Goethe,
music, Schiller, Nazis, chocolates,
Goethe, democracy, landscape gar-
dening, Sturm und Drang, ahunch-
back, Goethe, Bauhaus, the gro-
tesque, hermeneutics, and Goethe:
what do all of these things have in
common?

According to this weekend’s

second annual Davidson German
Studies Symposium, the answer is
Weimar.

A relatively small city in the
former East Germany (one of the
speakers called it “podunk” off the
record), Weimar is the 1999
Kulturstadt Europas, Europe’ s City
of Culture.

Home to Germany’s favorite
sons, Goethe and Schiller, as well
as Gropius’ Bauhaus movement,

Weimar has long been considered
the heart of German culture.

This designation excludes other
parts of Weimar’s past, however,
including the Buchenwald concen-
tration camp and the failed Weimar
Republic, the constitution for which
was drafted and signed in Weimar’s
National Theatre.

Being a city of such paradox,
