HERE’S lots of good

sound logic in that
slogan, Many a man with
plenty of brains has made
a failure simply because
he neglected his clothes.
Men of prominence and
power, if you will note,
are those who take pride
in their personal appear-
ance. Let us again em-
phasize: “Dress Well and
Succeed,”

We’re giving a lot of
thought to young men’s
clothes this fall. There’s
anew drape to the coat—
more ease and comfort—
anew “hang” to the

The game with Wofford on October 11
will find Richardson Field one of the best
equipped college fields in the South, The
seatiife capacity will be increased by the ar-
rival of 3,000 more seats, while interest will
be added to the game by the addition of a
scoreboard.

tions were shipped from a branch warchouse
in Richmond, Va., about a month ago. A
tracer was sent out for them this past week.
The new seats will be here within the next
week or so.

The scoreboard is to be located at one end
of the field and will show accurately the
scores, the downs, yards to go, minutes to
play in that quarter, last points scored and
the game for the following week. If the
plans which are now being drawn up are ac-
ceptable, work will start within the next
few days. :

The scoreboard is to be entirely original
and there will not be one exactly like it in
the whole country.

The Kick-Off |

By Don Wharton

Richardson Field was christened with a
14-0 victory, though the fact that it was a
christening game was relatively unknown— |
the Citadel game last year was played on the
practice field.

Despite the mud and mire the game was
clean throughout—clean playing and clean
sportmanship on the part of both teams and!
spectators.

“That's the best game that I've ever seen,
Nappy play” was what one of the coaches |
said Saturday evening about Captain Davis.
In our estimation it was the best game that
several other Wildcats have put up.

And the team as a whole looked like a
different machine from last years. Coaches
Monk and Tilson have surely drilled hard
tackling, constant digging, and line inter-
ference into the Red and Black squad. And
after all has been said about the spectacular
runs and the driving power of this and that
Davidson back, don’t forget that the line was
right there every moment of the game. And
don't forget that it was line interference that
made those plays go and coming out of the
line was surely hard work in that sticky
mud,

The fourth quarter when the real
power of the Davidson offense was sown.
Starting from our 20-yard line with Sapp
and Black and Sappenfield carrying the bail
the time, the backfield
carried the ball right down the field through
holes made by the Davidson line without
losing possession of the ball for a total of
74 yards. Then came a good punt, better
head-work by Captain Nappy in stopping it
on the one-foot line, and a safety. on Elon’s
attempt to punt out.

Was

most of Davidson

With the ball in the possession of Red
Anderson, Davidson tackle, behind Elon’s
goal line, there were quite a number who
couldn't understand the safety decision. It
would haye been a touchdown, had not Ref-
eree Sampson ruled that when he blew his
whistle the ball was in the possession of the
Elon back, and thereby a safety.

Coach Monk showed plainly that he was
building a winning team, not running up
scores, when he repeatedly sent in  substi-
tute after substitute in place of men who
were going good. Twenty-four men played
on the Red and Black team, of whom 10
were letter men. It was the first varsity
game for nine of these, but more than one of
that nine will be wearing a red “D" before
the Christmas holidays.

The Wofford Terriers, who will be the
meat for the Wildcats here on October: 11,
opened the season Saturday for the South
Carolina teams when in a drizzling rain,
which later changed into almost a storm,
they were defeated by the V. M. I.- Cadets
33-0.

Sappenfield’s great run of 72 yards after
receiving the Elon punt brought many re-
membrances of Flake Laird’s run to fame
year before last against the powerful V. P.
I, team. That was the time, when doped to
lose by several touchdowns, the Wildcats up-
held the record of not losing on Sprunt Field
since 1913 by tieing the Gobblers 7-7.

This year the Red and Black squad will
have several hard games on Richardson
Field, and to uphold this record the team
will have to go some, especially against |
Carolina. All kinds of support and encour-
agement must come from the Davidson stu-
dent body to win this game from the Tar
Heels.

This seems to be getting a little ahead of
time, for the P. C. is next, and we're play-
ing one game.at a time this year. Not much
tannbe, discousced -2bout..the~-Bluestockings.
Charlotte sport writers said that the game
was the best they saw last autumn. We
want another like it at Asheville, with some-

Bluestockings To Fight
Wildcats In_ Mountains

Coaches Working Men fo rthe Game
at Asheville nA mala Run

Speci:

When the Wildcats trot out on MecCor-
mick Field in Asheville next Saturday ait-
ernoon they will be going up against a foe
of unknown ability but with plenty of fight.
Presbytetian College has lost a number of
her stars of last year’s team, but Coach John-
son has the power to put such fight into his
candidates, that their positions will be ably
filled. Scant news has come frem Clinton,
and since the Bluestockings will open their
season with the game Saturday, very little
concrete dope can be had.

Needless to say Coach Younger will put
as good a team in the field in Asheville as
he has at his command. The Elon game
broke the gang in for a new season ot col-
legiate football and also brought cut the
weaknesses in the “thin red line.” With
Vance, first string guard, back in the game.
and Summers, the 200-pound tackle, ready
for action, the line will be in top form, Laird
will still hold down center and Boggs the
other guard position, Fighting  Brassie
Baker will probably remain at tackle, while
Captain Davis and Bohannon or Pinkney
will guard the flanks. The backfield will be
harder to choose. Indications are that Sap-
penfield will start at quarter, with Leggvite
and Black at the halback and
Sapp at full. This line-up may be changed
as coach has some subs that are fighting
hard for regular berths.

There is very little definite news about the
South Carolina bunch. At present it would
seem that Wilson, Who was the field general
for P. C. in that memorable tie with Clem-
son in 1919, will run the team from quarter.
Hunter and Edmunds are also possibilities.

positions,

‘Warner, a triple-threat man from last year’s
eleven, at right halfback, and Robinson at !

full, seem to be fairly safe of their berths.
Copeland is the favorite for the other back-
field position, with Jones, Holland and Walk-
er also in the running.

Out of six candidates for the end places,
Walker and Moore seem to have the edge
on the others. Captain Bomar is sure as a
tackle, and Griffen, a star on the Fresh
team of last year, will be in that hole on
the other side of the line. The guard jobs
are being hotly contended for by Workman,
Sisler, Smith, H. C. and J. H. McLarin, all
about even. Kirvin, who has been out already
this season with a bed leg, is again back at
practice, but Ferguson, a second stringer,
may be called in. To date the only other
casualties are Wilson with a torn ligament,
and Copeland with a bad sprained ankle.
Both are expected to be in uniform Sat-
urday.

This game promises to be a battle royal
between two old rivals. It will be no loose
early season encounter as previous scores
will show. P. C. has won twice in five con-
tests, once in 1920, the score being 7-0, and
again in 1922 with a score of 8-7, Davidson
has won an equal number of times, in 1921,
7-0, and last year, 3-0. The first game, in
1919, resulted in a 0-0 tie-up.
decide the issue.
