Pope dominates population
conference, Washington frustrated

By Andrea Short

Most casual observers and the
Pope probably think that Cairo
hosted an abortion debate last week.
Actually, the week-long world
population conference that willend
tomorrow was designed to address
much broader humanitarian goals:
managing resources, nutrition and
health ‘concerns, improving
women’s lives, economic devel-
opment, and providing safe and
effective family planning meth-
ods.

Conference participants hope
that the final accord will effec-
tively allocate 17 billion dollars
into locally administered programs
by the year 2000. This year’s con-
ference pinpointed improving
women’s status as.a crucial step in
reducing the population growth in
developing nations.

The recently-released study
“The “Second India’ Revisited” il-
lustrates how vital a high quality of
life is to curbing the population.
South India boasts high literacy
rates for women, equality between
the sexes, and a high average age
for first marriages, all of which
contribute to the two children per
family average.

By contrast, North India suf-
fers from illiteracy among women,
gender inequality, and a low aver-
age age for first marriages, causing
the considerably higher rate of five
children per family. This research
supports the theory that economic
development, improved status of
women, and available family plan-
ning must all interact to effectively
reduce the population explosion.

Spotlighting women and ef-
fective family planning in Cairo
has produced two programs that
will aid population control efforts.
Ten nations with successful family
planning programs, an alliance
called “Partners in Population and
Development: A South-South Ini-
tiative,” will share their expertise
with other developing nations. The
allied nations that include Colom-
bia, Morocco, Kenya, and Popula-
tion Conference host Egypt have
all managed to lower birth rates
significantly in the past two de-
cades,

Two United States conference
delegates, U.S. Representatives Pat
Schroeder (D-CO) and Constance
Morella (R-MD), will create an
action plan to aid women world-
wide. The bipartisan program

would work with U.S. assistance
programs to expand educational
and financial aid to women
throughout the international com-
munity.

Despite its humanitarian aims,
the conference has included some
mud-slinging and tactical manipu-
lation overabortion. Surprisingly,
the Vatican allied itself with some
Muslim countries last week in an
attempt to stall the accord and pre-
vent any mention of abortion in the
document. The Vatican has re-
fused to sign the accords that re-
sulted from the 1974 conference in
Romania and the Mexico City con-
ference in 1984. Strong antago-
nism between the U.S. delegation,
led by Vice-President Al Gore,
and the Vatican has remained.

The European Union has mod-
erated between the two delega-
tions, specifically reworking the
language regarding abortion, to
reach some agreement. Last Tues-
day, however, the Vatican garnered
enough support from its allies to
confound the consensus vote on
one paragraph of the 113-page
document and stall progress for
two days.

The accord in no way advo-

‘LSEWHERE

cates abortion as a family planning
method; the language merely states
that where legalized abortion ex-
ists, the procedures should be safe.
Pope John Paul II has verbally
attacked Vice-President Gore and
denounced the accord’s plan as “a
project of systematic death.”
Frustration with the Vatican’s
delays has prompted many nations
to denounce the Pope’s position

‘and the delegation’s tactics. After

the Vatican anda small minority of
nations sent the accord back for
reworking again on Tuesday, many

‘delegations booed their efforts.

Defending the Pope’s position, a
Chief Vatican spokesman called
“an international document pre-
paring policies for governments
that deal with human beings” a
concept that is “completely unac-
ceptable.” Perhaps someone
should have better explained the
term “population conference” to
him. :

The Pope’s insistence has

_ alienated someCatholic countries

and groups such as Catholics for
Choice, splintering the Vatican’s
traditional sources of support.

Cuba: Another refugee crisis

By Graham Ernst

Since Fidel Castro announced
that he would not stop citizens
from leaving his country, more than
22,000 Cubans have started the
90-mile voyage across the Florida
straits in search of political asylum
in the United States. However,
most all of the make-shift rafts
were intercepted by U.S. Coast
Guard vessels, which escorted refu-
gees to the U.S. Naval Base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This base
isnow home to over 40,000 yen
and Hatian refugees.

While Cuban and American
officials discuss how many U.S.
visas will be issued, the conditions
at Guantanamo are deteriorating.
There are now daily accounts of
organized stone throwing against
U.S. soldiers. While moving some
of the refugees to Panama may
provide temporary relief at
Guantanamo, no solution is offered
for the cause of the problem: the
continuing flow of refugees.

Unfortunately, Cuba is only a
‘small-scale example of the grow-
ing global-refugee crisis. Today,
there are more than 23 million refu-
gees worldwide.

Sources of this increase in-
chide new ethnic conflicts in former
Yugoslavia, Somalia, Sudan,
Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and
Rwanda; old foes have continued
fighting in Afghanistan; former
Soviet republics Georgia,
Tajikistan, ~-Armenia, and
Azerbaijan have also fallen victim
to this trend of domestic violence.
Each of the preceding conflicts has
resulted in at least a half million
refugees, 25 times more people
than the Cuban exodus.

In comparison to other refu-
gee camps, the situation in Cuba is

tame. In late June, Rwandans were
crossing the border into Zaire at a
rate of 10,000 people per hour.
Adding to the problem, Zaire lacks
many of the same resources as the
US. to help their neighbors. The
international community must
work together to prevent this glo-
bal crisis from expanding. Unfor-
tunately, support has been weak.
Neighboring countries are re-
luctant to host refugees, Pakistan.
closed its borders to hundreds of
thousands when Muslims resumed
fighting in Afghanistan. Zaire tem-
porarily blocked off its bridges
when news spread of another mass
exodus from Rwanda in late Au-
gust. Even the United States, with
all of its resources, has been un-
willing to accept a mere 40,000
refugees from Cuba and Haiti.
Although the United Nations
appears equipped to handle the cri-
sis, memories of failed efforts in
Somalia and the continued fight-
ing in Bosnia-Herzegovina reflect
the poor results of U.N. involve-

ment.

The immediate problems of
overcrowding will grow worse if
the global community doesn’t co-
operate to stop the increased flow
of refugees across the globe.

Unfortunately, the driving
forces of the problem, civil wars,
and illegitimate governments are
not easy to solve. They involve
complex political issues and deep-
rooted hatred among races. Unless
we find a way to stop the flow of
international refugees atits source,
this predicament will continue to
plague us into the next century.

NOTES

Nicholaas Biegman, the vice chair-
man of the drafting committee,
expressed disgust at the narrow
aims of the Vatican. “We have just
a week and a half to attract the
attention of the world, and all we
read is abortion, abortion, abor-
tion,” Biegman said. “I deeply
regret.it. I think it’s a pity.”

Thursday did bring progress
on other issues of the conference.
Leaving the abortion debate aside,
nations neared agreement on the
spending levels needed to slow
population growth. These nego-
tiations will allow the conference
delegates to solidify the programs
that are expected to be in place by
the year 2000. Sources expect the
United States’ current contribu-
tion to the 17 billion dollar fund—
585 million—to reach 1.9 billion
by the year 2000.

5, 7, 8, and 9 issues of The New
York Times and the September
Si issue of Time.

Rap and the Corporate World

‘Recently, rap music has put work in a new light. Hip-hop
offers a way for a few in the ghetto to get a job and a ticket to the
outside. And they use a worker’s vocabulary. Rappers have 'skills,'
their subordinates are 'crews,' and they often sing about business
matters; record contracts, talent scouts and album sales.

While rappers sing about the skills that pay the bills, white
bohemians write songs denigrating work. The slacker mentality of
alternative rock today has. its roots in punk rock, where the Sex
Pistols boasted, 'I’m a lazy sod' and Black Flag confessed, "We’ ve

And Now for the Good News

“The only good news for the environment is bad news from
other perspectives: the economic problems that have beset the
nation since the Soviet Union died are so severe that rapacious
development has actually slowed. That has helped alleviate the
threat to Lake Baikal, which only a few years ago was starting to
feel the strong polluting effect of an enormous paper mill on its
