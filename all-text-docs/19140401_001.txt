College Matters Discussed With
Educational Experts

Despite the fact that President_Wil-
son is exceedingly busy at this time.
. owing to the critical situation in Mex-

ico and the question of the repeal ‘of

.the Canal Tolls, which among many
other important matters, are requiring
his close attention just now, President
Martin, through the kindness of Senator
Overman, succeeded in securing a short
interview with the President on last
Vhursday, March 26.

After waitieg for about thirty min-
utes, President Martin was cordially
greeted by Mr. Wilson, who laid aside
heavier matters of State to recall pleas-
antly tor a few moments his college days
at Davidson and to enquire. about the in-
stitution as it is at present. He spoke
of President Martin's father, whom he
familiarly called “Colonel” Martin and
of his two sons, showing ‘that he still
intimately recalled even the small mat-
ters of his college days. He also ex-
pressed regret that ill. health -had com-
pelled his withdrawal from Davidson
at the end of his freshman vear. This
is a clear explanation of the facts con-
nected with his leaving, which is a
matter that has not been fully under-
stood by every one before. After a
word about Mrs. Wilson's brother, Pro-
fessor Axson, of Princeton, who was
also a Davidson Freshman and a_.class-
mate of President. Martin. a hearts
handshake and a mutual. expression of
good wishes, the visit was over.

It Was only a short interview. but
characterized by directness, simplicity
and cordialitv. President Martin, ‘in
sneaking of Mr. Wilson, said: “Mr.
Wilson is to me better looking than his
pictures, though they are exceedingly
like him. He gives you the impression
of strength, with much of it held in

~ reserve.”

lutervicw With Vice-President
Marshall

By invitation, President Martin join-
ed the Charlotte delegation which called
upon Vice-President Marshall, and in-
vited him to speak at the celebration of
the one hundred and thirtv-ninth anni-
versary of the signing of the Mecklen-
burg Declaration of Independence, on
May 20. Among those /in the party
were United States Senator Overman,
Secretary of Navy Daniels, and Con-
gressman Webb. Mr. Marshall met
the delegation in the Vice-President’s
room in the Capitol, where in an infor-
mal way the invitation was extended,
first by Secretary Daniels, who stood
up for the Mecklenburg Declaration
and the 20th of May in great shape.
then by each of the party in turn, as it
was only by their combined efforts that
his acceptance was secured. But the
matter was finally clinched and one of
the arguments used by President Mar-
tin was that the Commencement Ex-
ercises of Davidson would close on the
night of May 19 and that the student
body and commencement visitors would
he present in Charlotte in large num-
bers to greet and hear him. After the
interview with the Vice-President, the
party accepted the invitation of Secre-
tary Daniels to Junch at the Army and

Navy Club, where they had both a fine
lunch and-a good time.

Hak-a-rak-a-hoom-adlack! ‘Phe base
hall season has been ushered in, and dur-
ing the past few davs the Varsity. has
been daily getting in berier shape, and
Coach Cook is. satisfied that the Red
and Black Machine will come out on-
top_ere the season has closed, “Vhe games
so far have shown that the only thing
lacking is good, consistent, timely hit-
ting, and Coach jhas been devoting
more time to this part of practice than
previously, “The fielding has been above
par, particularly that of the infield.

In the Oak Ridge: game Davidson
outplaved them at every stage of the
game, but simph had ne lick, Several
risky chances were taken on bases that
would have been sate if the feld had
not been wet. ft is tree chat Mavbern
certainly had a pood btinch of plavers.
and they all) had good) wings. ‘The
Buffalo Leaguers did not come up be
cause of inclement weather. “Poo bad
we didw't get a chance to defeat them.
The same is true at Gastanin game.

. Trinity Series,

By next Wednesday Davidson will
have plaved three games with the strong
Methodist team frond the “Ball” City.
From the: games they have already
plaved and the “dope” that can be path-
ered, they have a dar better team than
they had last vear. ‘Vhev have a fast
fielding and good hitting team. On
March 25, in their games with William
and: Marv, they simply walked over this
strong team té the tune of 10 too. On
the dav following the Universitv of
North Carolina only defeated this same
team ¢ too. “On the next day. March
26, ‘Trinity fost te the University of
Vermont 2 to 0, on poor base ‘running.
although outg&ying that team. On
March 28 ‘Vritity walloped the Baptist
Ig to 2.

Now. the team will have toe go some
to beat this strang bunch of plavers. But
Davidson can do it. Plenty Pep is the.
word! When playing them on the Hill
let every student come out and back up
the Red and Black Machine; ves, “root,
root, root, for the home team!” and they
can’t help but win.

The following men were taken to
Gastonia to play ‘Trinity: Stough, Cray-
ton, Watkins, Witherington, Somer-
ville, Osteen, Currie, Anderson, Pa-
nella, Kluttz, Keesler, Walker, Chris-
tenbury, Manager Roberson, Assistant
Manager Mallov and Coach Cook.

CAROLINA CANCELS.

The University of North Carolina
manager has just wired Manager Rob-
erson that the game that was to be
plaved in Charlotte on April 21 will
have to be cancelled, as they have too
many games off their Hill already. The
Davidson manager says that he is al-
most certain that he can arrange another
game with them fos some day in April.
