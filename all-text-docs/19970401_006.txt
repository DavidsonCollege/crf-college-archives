Smiling, she asks, “Would you like
a condom to take with you? You
never know what might happen
between the Student Health Center
and your car.”

On the other side of the coin,
the students who were not arrested
have a few things to say. An anony-
mous former member of IVCF’s
executive board says, “Yes, it’s true.
I haven’t fornicated or committed
any crimes against nature, nor do I
intend to.”

After a pause, he continues,
“Wait, does kissing count?” It does
not. “Okay, then I haven’t done
anything illegal. After we’d been
dating for a year, my girlfriend and
I kissed once, butit felt sinful, so we
didn’t do it again.”

He shrugs and says, “I guess

we’ re just saving ourselves for mar-
riage. When you belong to Jesus
Christ, you can’t go around sinning
and giving yourself away to other
people. Like the Savior said, “You
cannot serve both God and mam-
mon,’ and sex is mammon, plain
and simple. I don’t mind, though.
When I think of how God loves me
extra sinceI don’t practice pre-mari-
tal sex or pre-engagement kissing,
it makes me so happy that I can
wait. No problem.”

Junior Eric Sapp says, “No,
you don’t need to quote me as an
anonymous source. I’m proud of
every single public stand I take,
because I’m always right. What’s

that?Oh yeah, what doI think about

the arrests?”

- He nods his head sternly and
says, “It’s about time somebody
started cracking down on those un-
godly slouches. We can’t go around
having sex with whomever we want.
That’s anarchy, and that’s the first

step toward destroying our great
American democracy. I love
America. I’m an American. I’m
proud to be an American, and we
can’t have people going around
breaking the law just because they
don’t like it.”

He continues, “The fact of the
matter is, I’m better than all those
sinners. That’s the truth, and if you
don’t believe me, ask my close per-
sonal friend God, or just read the
Bible. That’s the only book you
ever really need to read. It’s the
only one ever written that is without
flaw, and you just have to look to
Sodom and Gommorah to see what
God thinks about immorality.”

Senior Stephanie Moses, one
of the former IVCF executive board
members who was not charged,
says, “Bless you.”
