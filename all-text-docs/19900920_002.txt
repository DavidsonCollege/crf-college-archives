NEWS

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20 , 1990

By MIKA NABESHIMA

On September 13th, Dr.
SusumuNagai, a biology profes-
sor at Kansai University of For-
cigtt Studies in Japan, received an
honorary degree in Philanthropic
Hall. “This is the happicst day in
my academic career in my life
today,” said Dr. Nagai as he re-
ceived his new hood, becoming an
alumnus of Davidson College.
Since 1962 he has helped reeruit
Japanese students to students to
study at Davidson.

Arcceptionat the Carolina Inn
followed the dignified ceremony.
In addition to faculty members and
administrators, some Japancse
businessmen and people related to
Japanese affairs were invited.
Governor and Mrs. Martin also
made their appearance.

At the dinner following the re-
ception, Governor Martin told a
story about the first Japancse ex-
change student they hosted. (He
was a chemistry professor at
Davidson at the time.)

He expressed his hope that

North Carolina would continue to .

maintain good relations with Japa-
nese business.

During their five-day visit, the
Nagais were especially impressed
by the beautiful campus. Dr. Nagai
was glad to sce the liberal arts
tradition alive at Davidson.

In Japan today students study
only in a narrow and specialized
ficld. He feels the need, and hopes
for a revival of the liberal arts tra-
dition in Japan.

He also noticed how Christi-
anity still plays a positive role at
Davidson. They felt that Davidson
students are very fortunate to have
a rclaxcd environment, in which
they can study effectively.

Davidson Gives
Dr. Susumu Nagai
Honorary Degree

Dr. Nagai himself has never
attended nor taught at Davidson.

His first encounter with
Davidson was in 1958 aboard a
ship on his way home to Japan
after teaching at Southern Illinois
University for two years.

On board, he and his wife,
Hidcko, met Davidson alumnus
Malcolm R. Williamson, Jr. (class
of 1955) who was on his way to

India on a Fulbright scholarship

program.

During the cighteen-day trip,
they became very good friends.
The ship made a stop in Kobe
before it procccded to India and
the Nagais invited Mr. Williams to
their home in ncarby Kyoto. His-
tory professor Bradley Thompson,
then the director of International
Programs, later wrote to the Nagais
about the newly established
Richardson Scholarship Program
for foreign students and asked the
Nagais for recommendations and
help in recruiting students.

The Nagais. took on the re-
sponsibility as volunteer recruiters
and dedicated much of their pri-
vate time looking for qualified
Japanese students as well as pre
paring these students for Davidson
with intensive language courses.

Between 1962 and 1982, the
Nagais scent twenty students to
Davidson, with whom thcy still
keep in touch.

Mrs. Nagai plans to send the
second edition of this album with
the most recent pictures of the
former students, most of them now
with wives and children.

Davidson currently has two
students from Japan. Mika Na-
beshima is a senior political sci-
ence major from Yokohama, and
Asako Yoshii isa sophomore from
Sendai.

Ethics and Community To Be
Discussed at Symposium of
Medical Humanities

By JENNY WHITTINGTON

On September 27 and 28, a
unique group of Charlotte are doc-
tors, Davidson College professors
and nationally recognized experts
on medical ethics will gather at
Davidson to discuss “Responsible
and Responsive Medicine in the
1990s.”

The third annual Frederick
Womble Speas Memorial Collo-
quium is co-sponsored by
Davidson College and the Char-
lotte Area Health Education Com-
mittee.

It will involve about 150 prac-
ticing physicians, nurscs, health-
care administrators, philosophers,
clergy and national experts on
questions of medical ethics.

The colloquium provides
continuing cducation for Charlotte
doctors, but it represents another
aspectin the comprehensive under-
graduate medical cducation of
several Davidson students who will
attend.

These students will be gradu-
ating this year as medical humani-
ties majors, prepared for medical
school witha thorough understand-

ing of the ethical aspects of their
chosen career. Davidson is one of
the few undergraduate institutions
in the nation offering a medical
humanities program.

According to Director of the
Medical Humanitics Program
Rosemarie Tong, the program’s
intention is broader than just
humanism in medical training.

“Health care is a community
project, and must be community
directed. All students-have a re-
sponsibility as future community
citizens to be informed on these
issucs. It’s especially important for
those who end up in leadership
positions where they must decide
public policy,” said Tong.

Many medical humanities
speaker’ visit the campus during
the ycar, but the Speas Colloquium
is the major effort for the program.

The invited speakers are con-
sidered to be experts in their fields.

Dr. Howard Brody, a practic-
ing physician, is past president of
the Society for Health and Human
Values.

He is associate professor of
family practice and philosophy
director of the Center for Ethics

and Humanities in Life Sciences at

.Michigan State University.

Frank H. Marsh is professor of
medical ethics and law and direc-
tor of the program in medical eth-
ics at the University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center.

Reinhard Priester is a research
fellow at the Center for Biomedi-
cal Ethics at the University of
Minnesota.

Dr. Abigail Zuger, one of the
country’s foremost AIDS experts,
works in the division of infectious
discases at Montefiore Medical
Center in the Bronx.

Tong said the colloquium is a
unique collaboration. “You.don’t
usually see undergraduate institu-
lions cooperating with a hospital.

However, the Charlotte com-
munity is unique in that.there are
so many enlightened people inter-
ested in medical humanities and
willing to take the creative risk of
dealing with a liberal arts college.
They usually; focus on medical
schools or.a major university.”

Attendance at the conference
is restricted.

campus. Students have been called
at all hours of the day and night by
someone whoclaims that there is a
package for them at the Union desk.
Students are advised to call the
Union to confirm the validity of

any such calls that they receive.

Ray Thrower, Davidson Col-
‘lege’s director of public safety,
warned of student complacency in
the face of possible crimes. “‘Lock
your dorm room while you’re
away,” he encouraged, stating that
the 20 minutesthatsomeone might
use to take a shower might be the
amount of time thata thief nceds to
go to work.

He also noted that exterior
doors of many dormitorics. were
being propped, Icaving open the
possibility that an undesirable in-

truder might gain access to the-

dorms. _

“Tts your community; its only
as safe as you wantitto be,” heem-
phasized.

Residence Life has placed
lighter restrictions on partics in
gencral, but Patterson Court has
sctnonew rules for fraternities and
their rush procedurcs.

_ Fraternity members have in-
vited freshmen to parties in the
dormitories, senior apartments or
off campus. “Nine out of ten par-
ties that happen in Belk before the
rush period are pre-rush parties,”
said Ford ShIDpEY aBelk resident
advisor,

“Unofficially all houses start
rush as soon as classes begin. No
matter what you do, you can’t stop
unofficial rush,” said Shippey.

“Belk is a good place-to have them

because freshmen can take three
steps and be on sophomore hall,
where they are allowed to drink.”

Violation |

Patterson Court made the de-
cision four years ago to bar fresh-
men from the Court. They wanted

- to give freshmen morc time to get

to know members of their class
and gcta good start academically.

Freshmen males who were
interviewed say pre-rush parties
have posed no problems for them,
and they haven’t felt pressured to
join any one group.

“It’s been kind of nice to have
things todo, especially when things

_getslow,” said Ward Davis, a fresh-

man from Winston Salem, N.C. “I

can see the point that it defeats the -

purpose of keeping freshmen off
the court, though. Whoever’s in
charge should try to limit it. There
shouldn’tbetoomany.”
Freshmen of the class of 1989
were the last to fy the Court”

during the first weeks of school.
That class watched their grades
plummet to the lowest freshmen
grade point average ever in
Davidson’s history.

One of the basic reasons for
the rule is to keep freshmen from
drinking so much that it hinders
their adjustment to college life.

Atpresent, freshmen may drink
in their rooms but may not carry
alcohol into common hall areas,
such as lounges, hallways and
bathrooms. Hall counselors must
report freshmen to the dean’s of-

fice ifthey violate thisruleorscem -

to have a problem with drinking.

“The policy has some gray.

areas,” said hall counselor Steve
Lilly, “and the administration
knows that. But I think the school
is taking the right altitude in deal-

ing with the behavior issue. In alot
of ways it’s left up to the freshmen
tomake decisions, and that’s right-
-they’re adults.”

As Patterson Court and the
administration look into possible
changes in the alcohol policy, they
will have to address the issue of
pre-rush parties and theircontribu-
tion to alcohol problems on cam-
pus. HS GAS
Dean Terry hopes the Court
will “have the ‘courage” to take
initiative on this issue as they did
four years ago. “At first the Court
applauded the move,” said Terry.
“They said it was good for them as
well. But then little by little organi-
zations have eroded that idca. It is
my opinion that when we dosome-
thing like this, some group cer
