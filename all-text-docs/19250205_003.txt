Because his racket is immense
And he doesn’t miss a Bawl.

No matter what they be;
Not because they're funny jokes,
But out of policy.

“Dear Mr. Converse:

“We are two little friends in Florida.
Our mothers have asked us to write and

Shorter Catechism, and we enjoy read-

who have. We are having a fine time
going in swimming and eating oranges
but we wish we could see some snow. |
Every morning we help our mamas wash

Last Wednesday morning when the call of

like the rest of the fellows, thought the ex-
‘panse of whiteness was snow, boldly
ventured fortly into great unknown, but only
for a step or two, as his feet quickly chang-
ed ends with his head, and he made a flying
tackle at a sycamore tree. (For. sliding
purposes, an inch of sleet is worth a foot of
snow).

After a careful census was made, it was
learned that the prize of a diamond-studded

in front of West, but only broke three teeth,
Bill Ramsey broke one of his wooden legs
while trying to skate on the frozen rainy and
