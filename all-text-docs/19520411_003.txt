RACQUETS BOOM

CLEMSON HERE FOR RETURN FRACAS

Wildcat of the Week .... Lacy Keesler Smith, Courts
Probable Hurlers With Bill Dole At Helm

By JACK EFIRD

an appearance on the field.for a couple of hours every Saturday | |

afternoon.

At the most, it was not an inspiring talk. It was, rather, a
short statement of policy from a man who knows what he wants
and is used to getting it. In three years at Eastern Carolina Col-
lege, the school he left in favor of D. C., Dole did an admirable
job of pulling ECC’s Pirates out of the doldrums. Before that,

‘he put in a three-year stint at Fayetteville High School, producing | |

some of the best prep teams ever to see action in the Tar Heel
state. Wake Forest’s Nub Smith was one of Dole’s proteges, as
were the recently departed Wildcat stalwarts Jim Fasul and Bill
Acker.
Though we hate to admit it, Dole’s prospects aren't
The brightest ever faced by a new coach. Only 25 men re-
sponded to the call made for the Monday afternoon meet-
ing, and not nearly all of these were lettermen. There will
have to be a lot of new material coming in from some-
where—the most probable source being next year's fresh-
man crop. :

Even with the frosh being permitted to play, Coach Dole
will soon find that sailing will be anything but smooth. Be-
cause of a sanity code which is rougher than anything the Con-
ference ever imposed on its member schools, Dole is likely to find
himself in the same position many another Wildcat mentor has
faced; it is comparable to that of a prize fighter entering the
ting with his hands handcuffed in front of him. Though he can
flail about mightily, he can’t be expected to compete with his
opponent on an equal basis.

The scholarly-appearing Dole, however, has the look of a
man who has been faced with tough problems before, and it’s a
good guess that the decision of whether to come to Davidson
was one of them. There is no doubt that Dole is aware of the
fact that the last three Cat grid mentors stepped from Davidson
out of the coaching profession entirely. Whatever inferences he
might have drawn from this is unknown, but it should be enough
for the present to say that Dole has enjoyed a successful career
as a coach and evidently plans to continue doing so. It'll be a
long, tough road, but Dole has a few plans to put Davidson back
into the win column.

He won't change Crowell Little's basic formation very
much. He describes his lineup as a cross between the Chicago
Bears’ type of T and Don Faurot’s Split-T. “I don’t split
the linemen too much, but I do have my quarterback mov-
ing out and back of the line,” Dole explains. ‘This, plus
passing. Don’t forget that.”

Before he begins the '52 season Dole will need at least one
more assistant to coach his line. The resignation of Dick Red-
ding and Buddy Chandler within a few days of each other
leaves Dole with only one remaining member of the ‘51 staff,
backfield coach Tom Fetzer, to orient him with the problems the
Davidson position involves. The addition of Chuck Clements
of Gastonia should give the new coach an adequate staff for the
Spring drills.

At best, no one will be expecting miracles from the new
Wildcat coach. If he can mold a team which can win half the
games it plays next fall, the Davidson faithful won't have any-
thing to complain about. Even that would be a great improve-
ment over the last couple of seasons, during which the Red and
Black won only four games in all.

The best thing that could happen to Dole right now would
be to receive a full vote of confidence from his squad, the student
body, the faculty, alumni. and the Wildcat Club. With the ap-
pearance of Dole on the Davidson sports scene it’s a new ball

* game, and should be looked upon by all concerned as such. If
he has the support of all the above-mentioned plus a few more
good ball players, Coach Dole may be able to pull the Wildcats
out of the slough which they have sunk into in the past few years.

We wish him a lot of luck.

Phi Gams Cop Volley Ball
Crown As Season Nears End

Although the intramural volley-
ball season is not quite over, the
top team has already been decided
for this year, The winners of the
intramural volleyball championship
are the Phi Gams with an 11-0 rec-
ord for the seaon. This year’s show-
ing marks the fourth straight year
that the Phi Gams have been in
the top four in volleyball, but is
the first year they have walked off
with first place.

The championship this year
wee in doubt until the final
game when the Phi Gams met
the Phi Delts, both teams being
undefeated. The Phi Gams
proved to be the stronger, and
thus best their opponents in
two games. The victory for the
Phi Gams wasn’t due to any
one member's outstanding
ability, bue was, quite natural-
ly, a team victory.

In second place at present we
find the Phi Delts, who have lost

only one game, but they still have
three games remaining and any-
thing can happen.

The Sigma Chis, with a 9-2 rec-
ord, are already assured of third
place, and the possibility of a second
place position if the Phi Delts
should lose any more games.

Rounding out the top five at
present are the KA’s and SPE’s
with three losses apiece.

In the springtime tennis is al-
ways a big sport on the campus,
and although Davidson last year
sank below the standards set by
Cobb and Roddey during the pre-
vious years, there are several fac-
tors that indicate that it won't be
long before the Cats are once again
in that No. 1 spot in the South-
ern Conference. One of these is a
powerful bunch of freshmen headed
by Lacy s.cesler who is our choice
for the Wildcat of the Week.

Lacy comes from a family in
which tennis seems to be second
nature. He was preceded by
three brothers who for the past
eight years have kept the name
of Keesler high on the starting
positions of some powerful Da-
vidson teams. This year his
brother Dewey is captain.

Lacy was literally born with a
tennis racket in his hand and his
accomplishments in this sport prior
to his coming to Davidson make a
pretty impressive record.. He won
the state high school champion-
ship two years’ running and last
year he was victor in the State Jr.
Men’s Tournament. In his home
town of Charlotte last year, he was
the junior singles champion and
‘was a member of the winning
doubles and in the preceding year
he was on the finalists in both of
these events.

Although Lacy is only a
freshman, he has slammed him-
eelf into the Number One posi-

Golfers Meet
Rollins Again

By BOB BRANNAN

A well-balanced Davidson links
team will play a return match with
Rollins College Saturday morning
at Myers Park Club. On their
Florida tour the Wildcats were de-
feated by the Rollins team by one
point, 14-13, in pouring rain. Coach
Elgin White is looking for the links-
men’s second victory of the season
with this match.

As to who will be put in the
number one position is yet to
be decided. This and the num-
ber two spot have been the
weak points in the line-up.
These two positions collected °
only a total of one and one-
half points out of a possible 16
in matches with Wake Forest
and N. C. State. The Wildcats
were defeated 1536-12% and
1§-12, respectively, in these
matches last weekend. So far
this year Mac McLean, Al Pitz-
gerald, Jim Sloan, and Graeme
Keith have been tried in the
top slot by Coach White.

The team was greatly crippled by
the loss of Tom Abel because of
scholastic deficiencies. He was the
team’s strongest man at the time of
his departure.

The Wildcats have matches with
Rollins, North Carolina, Clemson,
N. C. State and South Carolina
remaining on the schedule. All of
these are home watches.

tion and shows every sign of
being able to hold it for the
rest of the season. In the four
matches to date, Lacy has won
all of his matches. Possessing
unlimited potentialities, he gives
promise of becoming, under

Coach Barton's’ . tutelage, one

of Davidson's really great ten-

is etars.

Outlooks for this season look
bright and with a little luck it
should be quite successful with the
prospects for the coming years
looking even bettter:

Tomorrow afternoon the Wildcats of Coach Dave Poole
will go out on the diamond to oppose again the Tigers of Clem-
son. In the first meeting of these two ball clubs, the Cats were
trounced 21-6 in a game marked by high winds, hits and errors.

The starting battery for the
home teams will probably be
Andy Courts or Jim Smith and
Bill Glidewell. The infield will
stand with Southwell, Gray,
Guiton and Whisnant. The out-
field will probably be made up
of Gilley or McCall, Stowe and
Branch,

The Cats have a record of two
wins against Springfield and The
Citadel and four defeats at the
hands of .Springfield, Furman,
Clemson, and Ohio University. The
Tigers have a record of three wins
and six defeats. At the beginning

The Cats met Lehigh this after-
noon and the results were too late
for publication.

Bill Bradley scored the only
singles victory of the afternoon
when he defeated Allan Strand in
a long and gruelling match which
ended with Strand on the long end
of 6-3, 6-8, 6-2 score. It was just
wot Strand's day. The former Da-
vidson captain went down together
with Dewey Keesler, in straight
sets in the number one doubles
match, 6-4, 6-1, for Davidson's
second and last loss of the day, as
the Wildcats swept all the rest of
the matches. .Match scores were
as follows:

On Tuesday the Wildcats
lost an 8-3 decision to Ohio
University even though the
home club outhit the visitors
fifteen hite to ten. This marked
the first game in which the
Cats had really found their bat-
ting eyes, getting twice their
usual number of hits.

Poole is counting on this newly
found hitting strength to help the
tight fielding infield to capture this
second Clemson game.

Recently the hitters have been
led by Fred Stowe and Arnold
Whisnant. The ficlders have been
paced by Johnny Gray and Johnny
Guiton.

The pittching staff has been hav-
ing a rough time in the last three
games in allowing thirty-seven runs
to cross the plate. Thus far Jimmy
Smith has shown up as the leading
pitcher on the staff.

Spring practice for the Wildcat
footballers begins Wednesday aft-
ernoon with Head Coach Bill Dole
in the driver’s seat. The new Cat
mentor will have only about two
full teams of regulars to work
with, but he has expressed high
hopes that former high school ath-
letes at Davidson not out for the
gridiron sport will respond to his
call for more men.

In the twenty-day period that is
the duration of spring drills, Dole
will have a major task on his hands.
He'll have to learn the capabilities
of all his lettermen, determine the
possibilities of the new grid hope-
fuls, and orient himself with an en-
tirely new school and conference.

But the biggest job Dole will
face will be the one of install-
ing his T-formation, which, as
he describes it, appears not a
great deal . different from
Crowell Little's modified split-
T. Dole has his quarterback
moving out and back behind
the line, utilizes the box for-
mation, along with some fast,
tricky buck-lateral plays. He

plans.
