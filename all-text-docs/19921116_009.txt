Pithy Irreverence...

Ho, Ho, Ho? |

Dear Santa,

I realize the North Pole post
office is flooded with millions of
letters from kids all over the world
about this time of year, all ad-
dressed to “Mr. Claus.” But this
one’s different. This isn’t one of
the greedy “Gimme” letters you
usually get.

I’m concemed. This whole
“Xmas” deal has gotten way outof
hand.

The other night I saw Nippy
and Chilly and acouple other elves
putting up the fake pine wreaths
with accompanying electric
candles on the telephone poles on
Main Street. I shivered and tumed
my back tothe balmy wind sweep-
ing across the Piedmont.

“Seasons Greetings,” it says
on the banners they hung at the
plaza in Cornelius. Which season
would that be? Late fall?

I know the elves are getting a
little itchy this time of year, having
finished tacking together all the
toys and gotten them wrapped and
ready for The Big Eve.

I imagine there’s nothing
worse than idle, bored elves.
They’re probably into the eggnog
and flirting with Missus Claus, tie-
ing the reindeers’ antlers together,
and going for joyridesin the sleigh.

So it’s perfectly understand-
able that you’d try to occupy their
time by having them help with
publicity. I realize the need for
advertising. Without all the deco-

rations and reminders, people
might forget about Christmas en-
tirely. And those “Sorry I forgot
your Christmas...” cards are so hard
to find.

But here’s a-better idea: get
the delinquent elves to go around
andcollectall the ridiculous Christ-
mas crap. Away with the fiber-

Sean Lind

glass Frostys. Rip down all those
red, green, orange and purply lights
that garnish the neighborhood
houses, making our streets look
likerunways. Confiscate those big
plastic mechanized replicas of you
and the reindeer that adorn the
center of every mall.

All I’m asking is, hold the

kitsch. Tinsel sucks. Bring back
the real spirit of Christmas.

Now to the important part: .

whatI want (OK, Ilied. This is one
of those “gimme” letters after all.
Buthey, I want to do away withall
the cheesy stuff, not the gifts. I’m
a firm believer in the Season of
Getting.)Since:I already have my
two front teeth, I would like:

1. A little snow. Just enough

©. to cover the ground and make ev-
* erything

look all  winter-
wonderlandy. Of course, here at
our pristine college, any snow
would probably be collected im-
mediately and put with all the
leaves.

2. A babe

3. A well-researched, well-

- written Honors Thesis

4. My very own still

5. I’m not clear on this, but
can we defer presents? If so, I
could use a really great, interest-
ing, very high-paying job in about
six months.

Now, if you’ve been making a
listand checking it twice, you know
Ihaven’tbeena very good boy this
year. Can’tyoucut me some slack?
I can make up good excuses.

But if it must be coal, make it
the very old, crushed-under-ex-
treme-pressure kind that sparkles.

Thanks, Santa. The cookies’ Il

be on the end table near the La-Z-
Boy. {
Love,
Sean

Davidson In Belfast...

Bomb Explodes in South Belfast

By Rob Kelly

WhenIfirstcameto Davidson
three years ago, imagined a small,
regional liberal arts college where
I and those like me could study
literaturein relative seclusion from
the outside world. I did not expect
to be bothered.

Yet, before long I was bump-
ing into people who had travelled
to all the different parts of the
globe. Not only was Europe repre-
sented, but also Asia, South
America, Australia, and Africa. In
my first year I met one student
who’d just returned from Argen-
tina, another from Nepal, a third
from Australia, and a fourth from
Brazil. In the next year I watched
people depart for India and En-
gland, Russia and Greece. I began
to envy and also wonder what was
happening in these places?

Davidson’s students who
travel abroad are still Davidson
students; the places they travel to
simply become outposts for
Davidson. And why shouldn’t all
Davidson students know what’s
happening on their Spanish cam-
pus, thier French campus, their
Germaneiampus, and so on?

Soon I was dreaming of trav-
elling abroad myself (somewhere
innocuous, somewhere safe) and
maybe attempting correspondence
back home... .

Three years later, I am in
Belfast, North Ireland, concentrat-
ing on English and Irish Studies.

Iam due to spend a year here,
and through the course of this year
— if my tender editor allows it —
I will be updating youon the events
taking place on our Belfast cam-
pus (cut into the woods behind Phi
Delt, continue three thousand miles
— bring boots).

__ Inaddition tothe weekly news,
I also hope to provide some much-
neglected background information
on this region, including physical
geography, ethnography, and the
history which predates the situa-
tion of today.

Unfortunately, first things
first...

On September, 23 at 8:45
P.M., a massive 2000 Ib. bomb
exploded in South Belfast, devas-
tating an entire city block and send-
ing shock waves as far as ten miles
away. It effectively wrecked its
target, the Government Forensics
Science Labratory.

Although, killing no one, the
blast injured twenty-three people.
The bomb has been attributed to
the Irish Republican Army, an in-
dependent parliamentary organi-
zation opposed to British rule in
Ireland. The GFSL analyzed evi-
dence gathered for court cases.

The blast is the largest in the
recent history of Belfast and was
feltby most of the city. I was three
milesaway at the time, lounging in
the student: union, and I felt the
walls rumble around me. Another
student, located closer to the blast,

was thrown through the front door
of his dorm’s laundry shack.

The effects were greatest,
however, in Belvoir Park Estate,
the residential district adjacent to
the lab. There, multi-storied flats
had their front walls blown in.

One of the residents, Linda
Taylor, spoke to the Belfast Tele-
graph: “I was just sitting watching
television . .. and my twelve year
old daughter, Emma, was sitting at
my feet. The next thing all hell
seemed to break lose. The window
came in and I threw myself on top
of her...”

Patrick McAtter, anotherresi-
dent was amazed: “All the bed-
rooms in the flats faced toward the
bomb and they are full of lethal,
long slivers of glass.”

Josephine Smith, who is in
her 80’s, concurs. “My son Fred
who lives on the tenth floor had
just moved away from the window
where the pane of glass fell just
where his head had been.”

Rescue and repair teams
moved in quickly to aid those areas
worst hit, with representatives from
local churches helping out.

At last check, officials were
unsure of the damage to the FSL.

Although larger bombs have
been laid in the past, each was
found and dismantled before deto-
nation. The 2000 Ib. blast repre-
sents the largest to hit Belfast since
the new Troubles began.

delphia sticker on the back of acar
with Georgia plates. I don’t know
why anyone would admit to hav-
ing visited there, but it was cool to
see my hometown on a car. I’ve
also seen quite a few “Atlanta
Braves” stickers, and even one
“BlueJays.” Thereis truly asticker
for everyone.

The war of words will con-
tinue on my little Escort. In addi-
tion to the Davidson sticker I put

overmy “Buchanan for President,”
I have room for several more.
Bumper stickers are uniquely
American. You never see Itaqi’s
with “Saddan » Sexy” onthe back
of their cars. We are obnoxious
people, but proud and secure
enough to open ourselves up for
personal attack by advertising our
beliefs. Anyway, if someone
threatens me, I’ll honk at them,

book that listed how far 3.14 was
carried out. Of course, it never
stops so how did he decide when to

_ stop? Ican see him agonizing over

what to do. “Do I stop at
100,989,283 ,292 decimal places or
100,989,283,293 decimal places?”
God, what a horror. Well, actually
that’s not scary, it’s just a stupid

waste of time.

Anyway, I’m just trying to
say that people are afraid of ridicu-
lous things. Which is fine as long
as they remember to soak their ear
lobes in lemon juicefor six min-
utes every time something fright-
ens them.
