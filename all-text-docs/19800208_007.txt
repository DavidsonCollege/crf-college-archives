Eating Independently: Alternatives to overcrowding

By MELISSA MCKEITHEN
Staff Writer

In a few weeks, the members
of the freshman class - will
submit their eating house pre-
ferences for the upcoming year.
But this year’s freshman class
in larger than in the past, and
predictions are that approxi-
mately one-hundred to two-
hundred freshmen will not get’
into an eating house. As a
result, these freshmen will be
faced with a new challenge as
sophomores—eating indepen-
dently.

There are, of course, certain
options readily available to
those who do not end up on
Patterson. Court. Some may
choose to continue eating at
Richards and Bailey, the two
Slater-serviced houses, while
others may opt to prepare their
own meals. Fourth floor Belk
has a kitchen, as does Cannon,
and one can always purchase a
toaster ovenand an electric
frying pan. In addition, the off
campus student houses have
kitchens, opening up another
possibility to upperclassmen.
As freshmen face the possibi-
lity of self-inflicted ptomaine,
some upperclassman opinions
may prove helpful in selecting a
course of action.

the brainchild of junior Weezie
Mann who is responsible for
setting up and maintaining it.

Mann said the purpose of the
library is to provide first, a
variety of resources to aid in the
pursuit of and growth in a
Christian life; second, a source
for Bible study ideas; and third,
a place and opportunity for
“quiet time.” .,

who was unable to self-select

last year. He lives on fourth

Belk but chose to continue -

eating at Richards and Bailey
because he does not have access
to a refrigerator. As far as the
Slater service is concerned,
however, he feels that the food
has improved since last year.
Teague does not plan to con-
tinue eating independently. He
is on a waiting list for Fannie
and: Mabel’s and will eat there
next year.

In contrast, other upper-
classmen have chosen to avoid
Slater and cook on their own.
One such student is Jeannie
Newman, a senior living at
Grey House. She and eight
others living there eat indepen-
dently. Each person fixes her
own meals in the house kitchen,
some actually cooking and
others: staying more with quick
foods such as yogurt. Newman
ate on Patterson Court her
sophomore year, then after
spending her junior abroad
decided to become independent.
She does not regret the decision
because she is.a vegetarian and
feels. that it is virtually impos-
sible to continue that practice at
an eating house. ;

In addition, she is eating at a
cost of two to ten dollars per
week (considerably less than
that of an eating house) and she
enjoys being able to eat at her
convenience rather than at a set

Christian library provides variety

By SUSAN WOODIE

Staff Correspondent
There is a new library at
Davidson College and it’s well
worth checking out.-The Chris-——pooks, files, pamphlets, and

library is open 24 hours a day,
mene. it a convenient “drop-
in”’ place.

Available in the library are

cassette tapes. The books are -

divided into such categories as
Tough Questions; Study
Guidés/Meditational; Love,
Sex, and Marriage (not neces-
sarily in that order); and Espe-
cially for Women, to name a
few. Some have rather eye-
catching titles like “Help! I’m
in College!” and ‘Freedom from
Fat’’—a Christian approach to
weight loss!

In the cassette tape collec-
tion, there is a series on
Personalizing Theology, and a
series of lectures by Josh Mc-
Dowell, among others. The file
boxes contain a wealth of

hour. Having guests over for
meals and experimenting with
new recipes also make indepen-
dent eating enjoyable for her.
Seniors John Mottice, Scott
Goodwin, Margaret Bumgard-
ner, Ann Tutwiler, and David
Litaker have formed their own
mini eating club. They cook at
Cannon three nights a week and
at Martin Manor two nights a
week. Mottice, like Newman,

‘noted the fact that it.is cheaper

to eat independently and
pointed out the advantage of
being able to choose what one+
eats. Eating independently is
also a good alternative for those
who are dissatified (for what-
ever reasons) with the eating
houses.

On the negative side, one
misses out on. the social acti-
vities of the eating houses and
the opportunity they present for
meeting others. There are also
the problems of having to shop
and prepare every meal, both of
which can be time consuming.

Some students are forced into
eating independently, but more
have deliberately chosen to
prepare their own meals. Eating
on Patterson Court is not
crucial to survival at Davidson;
The various alternatives offered
under the heading of ‘‘Indepen-
dent Eating’ may appeal more
than those much-coveted spaces
on the court.

information on missions and
Christian projects (in the U.S.
and abroad), including ad-
dresses for more information.
The files also contain current
information on various Chris-
tian organizations and agencies,
in the form of periodicals and
newsletters. There are pamph-
lets addressing various aspects
of the Christian life and life in
general, and a bulletin board for
the same purpose.

All the materials in the
library have been donated,
loaned, or solicited by students.
Books, files, and cassettes may
be checked out for one week at a
time, by simply filling out a
card available at the library
desk. According to Mann, the
library is not “simply a DCF
function; is is open to the whole
campus.”
