How DO these new fasteners work?

I've always wanted to be a
diletante. I professed to-be one
until Cindy Grant asked me in a
fellowship interview, “What is
your definition of literature?’’ I
scratched my head and rambled
for five minutes, finally relin-
quishing my verbal struggle
with, “'That’s a good question.
I'm afraid I don't know. But if
I win the fellowship I promise to
write my dissertation on litera-
ture, what it means to twentieth
century man, the etymology of
the word.”

Obviously Cindy wasn't very
impressed because I had origi-
nally stated that I needed the
fellowship to pursue my studies
in British literature. And before
One can successfully pursue
anything he must first know
what it is so he might recognize
it if he found it.

_ During these last few months
‘at Davidson I have tried. des-
-Perately to overcome my ‘uade-
quacy. I-discovered that litera-
ture is a form.of.art. Now I am
stuck with trying to define art.
I will, of necessity, Heatrick this

discussion to the.literary arts
because, as. for my definition, a
look at painting and music
would only confuse it.

I have no palette or reper-
toire, I can't paint-by-number
or play a guitar. I couldn't draw
a straight line if there were no
such thing as crooked. I
couldn't carry a tune if I picked
one up and took it.

enough to perform a lobotomy,
to create an elephant from a
stick of mahogany, to trans-
form a rock into a pieta, or reuse
the stone chips to construct a
nice tessella.

Of poetry. Davidson has its
own school of poetry, so I've
discovered. It is called *‘The
Grabbin’ in the Grass School of
Poetry."’ Its members skillfully
combine the confessional with
imagism, resulting in ‘Much
can be/done in/a red wheel/
barrow/glazed with rain/water/
besides eating/chicken.”’

Some of the local favorites
have gained national recogni-
tion with profound works such
as: "We did it in iambic

Happy Centennial Birthday, D

‘This Shturday, May 5th, the
Town of Davidson is having a
birthday, celebrating 100 years
aS an. incorporated town.
Though Davidson was incor-
porated in 1879, ‘‘the town
actually grew up with the
college," explained Dr. . Mary
Beaty, Reference Coordinator
and Assistant Director of the
Library.

Davidson College was estab-
lished in 1836 as the Coricord
Presbytery Manual Labor Ins-
Litution. Students were required
to work on the campus about
three hours each day. Accord-
ing to Dr. Beaty, ‘‘students
despised the requirement” and
it was dropped three or four
years later.

There was a three member
faculty, including the Presi-
dent, when the college was first

chaic,” “*Anapest is best but a
move that's retractile is fun
done in dactyl,"’ ‘Confessions
of a heroic couplet." I might
add that some of the shaped
poetry is unusual.

I will say no more about this
school of poetry because I
flunked out when I read my
masterpiece, “‘Quoting Milton
while picking tulips beside the
post office.”

On to my definition of ART.
Let's look at the etymology of
the word: 1) Art and Artaxerxes
are not one and the same. The
Persian king, I am sure, did not
use a nick name. 2) Nor is it for
Artemis, the Grecian moon
goddess, the daughter of Leto
and famed virgin huntress. 3)
An -interpretation’ that I find
atrocious is to use «art to
abbreviate artereiosclerosis.
(Though I have to admit that
some things labeled art are
enough to thicken the blood and

clog up the heart.) 4) It is not
for arthritis, though I will make
the point that some things
called art are a pain in the joint.

5) It’s not for arthrospore —

{found in bacterium) though

May 4, 1979-— The Devideonian 6

ustablished. One of the first
buildings erected was the Presi-
dent’s Home built in 1836-37.

As enrollment. increased, the
town’s population did, too.
Boarding houses sprung up to
accommodate the new students.
Copeland House was one of the
earliest houses in Davidson
used for boarding students.

In 1879 there was a move-
ment among the people to break
with the college and become an
official town. Thus the town of
Davidson College was born 100
years ago.

It was not until 1891 that
College" was dropped from the
official town name. Dr. Beaty
pointed out that it was about
this time that the townspeople
also formed a church that was
not affiliated with the Davidson
College Chapel.

This weekend, College and
townspeople are coming to-
gether to celebrate’ Davidson’s

The

or

‘What
True Art
is Not’

some artists seem smitten by an
infectuous delirium. 6) It’s not
short for artichoke, yet the
comparison can work if you
consider that some .art seems
rooted in dirt. 7) Nor is it for
arthropod, though there is a

connection between segmented ,

bugs and poems written in
sections. (And some forms of
art are just as detestable as
balck creeping things and over-
cooked vegetables.) 8) Art is. for
artem, the only Latin word,
meaning beauty created, visual-
ized or heard. And I know most
would argue with this final
‘thought, ‘so that’s why I most
listed: What True Art is NOT.
As you can tell, I spent much
time and energy in my research.
I submitted by thesis to a
committee at Oxford and was
awarded a. Ph.D. (Philolagiae
diletante). As soon.as I: learn
enough Latin to decipher my
