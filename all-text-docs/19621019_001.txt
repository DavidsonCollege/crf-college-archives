Frosh Parents
To Annual

Though the fact is somewhat disturbing to the class
of '66, according to Dean Burts this year’s Freshmen |

Parent’s Day will not differ

ones.

“This is the fifth year of the
event,” Dean Burts explained,
“and really our only major
change has been the addition of
activities on Friday night.”

This change is intended to
provide for parents who have
come from long distances and
arrived early. This year the par-
ents have been invited to attend
the Friday night performance
of “The Man Who Came to
Dinner.”

This year’s Parent's Day is
occurring a few weeks earlier
than in previous years in or-
der to avoid conflict with var-
sity football games.

For this reason the Freshman
Council has been unable to con-
duct some of its business includ-
ing electing a president, and
David Meschan is serving as its
representative on the assembly
program.

The bulk of the operation
will begin Saturday, and the
preparations of the Dean of
Student's office and the Fresh-
man Council will at last have
tangible results. Registration
begins at 9 a.m. in the Union.
Approximately three hundred
and fifty parents are expected
to show up.

Tours will be conducted at
regular intervals. Chip Sanders
and his committee have drafted
about twenty freshmen to point
out the various places of inter-
est on the campus. Some depart-
ments, such as ROTC. will put

significantly from previous |

|
on demonstrations for the tours. |
Some parents will also attend
morning classes and the faculty
has been alerted to be ready for
visitors.

From 12 noon to 1:45 p.m.
a buffet luncheon will be serv-
ed in Chambers for the fresh-
men and their parents. Facul-
ty advisors are also invited to
attend. Dean Burts expects a
crowd of over six hundred.

At 2 p.m. an assembly pro-
gram will be held. The Chapel
Choir will sing, and Freshman
Bill Aitken will play the organ.
An opening welcome will be
given by President D. G. Mar-
tin, followed by an introduction

Flock

of various administrative heads.

Dean Burts will then give |
an orientation speech for the |

parents. “We will try to fill
them in on what is happening
around campus,” the Dean
said.

Following the assembly a cof-
fee organized by Mrs. Moore will
be served outside Chambers. The
rest of the afternoon there will
be no official program, but
seven fraternities are holding
open houses. Saturday night the
Union will serve a special op-
tional supper.

The day culminates with the
freshman football team’s game
with the Furman freshman
team. The game begins at 7:30
p.m., and according to Dean
Burts, “The gates of the stad-
ium are open to all.”

Random Poll Among Fros
Reveals Violation Of Rules

BY JIMMY DOWNEY

Davidsonian

A poll taken this week B.R. (Before the Riot) showed

Staff Writer

that some 37 per cent of the freshmen were violating one
or more of the Freshman Regulations.

The poll, taken on a random
day at a time when the fresh-
men were going to the Union
for dinner, covered a consecu-
tive one hundred freshmen. The
violations that the poll covered
were the failure to wear name
tags and the prescribed beanies.

With one freshman participat-
ing in taking it, the poll indicat-
ed that the most flagrant viola-
tion was a lack of name tags. Of
the 100 freshmen, only 76 had
their mame tags on—a 24 per
cent violation of the third regu-
lation.

Eight per cent of the total
number had neither a name
tag nor a beanie, thus violat-
ing two regulations. The other
five per cent of the violators

. did have their name tags but

were not wearing their
beanies.

Even if the percentages were.
only correct to one significant
figure, they would indicate a
wide-spread disrespect for the
Freshman Regulations.

One freshman commented
on the regulation system: “!
think it’s good at first, but it
gets pretty old after a while.”
When asked why he himself
was not wearing his nametag,
he replied, “! lost it this morn-
ing.”

He defended himself by say-
ing that he was not a repetitive
violator, but he seemed to feel
not at all uneasy about going
without it. What about greater

Student, Date Injured
In Weekend Accident

BY TOM LOFLIN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Jim Melton, a member of Phi Gamma Delta social fraternity, and his date, Miss
Nancy Duckworth of Glen Alpine, N. C., are in Memorial Hospital in Charlotte after
receiving injuries from an automobile accident at 6 a.m. Sunday.

Melton and his date were trav-
eling toward Charlotte on U.S.
21 following an _ after-dance
| party when the sophomore from
| Pea Ridge fell asleep at the
jwheel of his car. The vehicle
‘left the highway, ran over a
|culvert, and overturned against
a utility pole.

Both of the occupants were
removed unconscious through
the broken windshield. The

Competition Begins
For Scholarships —

The Davidson Committee on
Graduate Scholarships and Fel-
lowships has already nominated
twelve men to compete for
Woodrow Wilson National Fel-|
lowships. The fellowships are |
awarded to those interested in
teaching as a career and is valid
at the university of their choice.

Of interest to the candi-
dates and other students con-
sidering graduate work wiil
be the informal meeting with
Professor Fredson Bowers of
the University of Virginia at
4:30 p.m., Oct. 24 in the
Green Room of the Union.

Bowers was recently § the
chairman of the Wilson Founda-
tion for this region. He will ad-
vise students on any phase of
graduate work in the various
schools offering graduate study.

Several scholarship programs
similar to the Woodrow Wilson
fare also available at Davidson.
Among these is the Rhodes
Scholarship, one of the oldest
and best known scholarship pro
grams. Its recipients are fur-
nished adequate funds to com-
plete two or three years study
at Oxford.

A parallel plan is offered
by the Marshall Scholarships.
The participants in this pro-
gram study in Great Britain
at the university of their
choice under approximately
the same conditions as those
students under a Rhodes
Scholarship.

For men considering the min-
istry there is the Rockefeller
Brothers Foundation Scholar-
ships. It includes room, board,
tuition, and fees plus $600 to
cover the cost of books and per
sonal expenses for one year.

of the above programs is avail-
