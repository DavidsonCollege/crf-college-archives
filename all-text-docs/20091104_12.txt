After the women’s soccer team
allowed the tying goal in the 86th
minute, the "Cats downed Georgia
Southern in the closing moments to
advance to the SoCon tournament
this weekend.

Facing the one-win Georgia
Southern Eagles, the "Cats were
well aware of the stakes, and
nerves were in fall force. With Lor-
ing Ward ’10 between the pipes for
senior night, the home team took an
aggressive stance from the get-go.

By minute 10, the ’Cats had al-
ready launched five shots, and that
tally steadily climbed throughout
the first half to top out at 16. Their
opposition managed one attempt on
goal. But through the first 45 min-
utes, Davidson’s repeated rips at the
net refused to amount to a score.

It was obvious who controlled
the game, but the frustration still
set in the Wildcat offense. Blakely
Low ’10 and Kyri Bye-Nagel *10

The Davidson Wildcats played
a phenomenal match against Long-
wood to wrap up their regular sea-
son games Saturday afternoon on
the Belk Turf field. Goalkeepers,
Christa Goeke ’10 and Mary Clay
710, and midfielder, Liz Luckey
”10, were all recognized before the
competition for their commitment
to the team.

The Cats 4-2 defeat over Long-
wood and constant effort on the
field certainly made it an exciting
game to watch. As Coach Ginny
Sutton said, “All of their hard work
is paying off. We’re peaking at the
right time and put together a great
70 minutes today.”

The first half of the match start-
ed off with back-to-back goals, but
soon leveled off to a steady half
of offensive attacks and defensive
resistance from both sides. Off a
play from a penalty corner in the
13th minute of the game, Jennie
Mostellar ’11 scored the first goal
of the match.

Longwood rallied back quickly
with a penalty shot only two min-
utes later by Lauren van de Kamp.
The rest of the first half remained

combined 11 shots, but had noth-
ing to show for it. As the teams
retired for halftime, the score held
nil-nil. And a tie wouldn’t do it—a

win was a must for a chance at the
postseason.

Late surge propels Wildcats
to 4-2 victory over Longwood

the Longwood match commenced.
Longwood took the 2-1 lead when
Lauren van de Kamp scored her
second goal of the game.

The Wildcats, however, came
back with a vengeance. With a pass
from Ellie Szykowny ’11, Hannah
English ’12 scored off the next
penalty corner opportunity. With
barely any time left on the clock,
the game stood even at 2-2. An
unsatisfied Davidson rallied and
Goeke, the goalkeeper, held off the
Longwood offensive pressure, as
Szykowny scored with only 2:38
left in the second half from an assist
by English. In the final seconds of
the game, Davidson scored again,
when Mostellar tapped a shot from
Clare Perry ’11 across the goal line,
creating a 4-2 win.

The game was close with the
Wildcats outshooting Longwood
by only a 15-13 margin and leading
in penalty corners by 8-6.

“We had a great effort today,
and now we’re looking forward to
going out to California for the con-
ference tournament,” Sutton said.
The Cats now stand at 6-11 overall
and 2-4 in NorPac East.

ing in a pair of home matches over

25, 24-26, 25-16, 15-10) victory.

In the opening set of Friday’s

until the Terriers responded with a
5-0 run to take a 16-14 lead. The
"Cats won three of the next four
points to tie the game at 17-17 and
