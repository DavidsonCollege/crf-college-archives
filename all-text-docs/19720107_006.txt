The Ravidsantan

Proposes $50,000 For Dorms

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

Faced with the destruction
of the College Union, the Resi-
dence Hall Council (RHC),
spearheaded by president Bill
Alexander, has approached the
administration with proposals to
equip the dormitories with mas

sive kitchen and recreational
facilities.

“This has climaxed every
thing I've been working for in
RHC because I think dorm im
provement should be the main
objective of every RHA presi-
dent.” Alexander said.

The proposals were submit-

If the college were to rent

In addition, Lemza may bring
an extra movie for showing.

The special showings are an

by Robin Gray and Jewett.

ied in a general meeting of the
RHC with Director of Student
Housing Scotty Nicholls, Dean
of S:udents Will H. Terry, and
college Business Manager Rob-
ert A. Currie.

The recommendations include
the following: 1) A recreation
room in each residence hall
which would contain full kitch
cu facilities (stove, refrigerator,
cooking utensils), ironing facili-
ties, an ice machine (similar
to the one already in Belk
dorm), and such items as_ pin-
ball machines, ete.:

2) Carpeting for all dorms,
beginning this summer with
Belk. Little. and = one other

dorm (this includes roums even-
tually, but the halls are to be
carpeted first);

3) Bulletin boards for each
freshman hall for announce-
ments to be posted;

1) Ping pcnug tables tor each
dorm located in an adjacent
area outside each building (as
say, the patio of Belk).

Considering the cost of the
facilities (an ice machine alone
runs approximately $800) as
well as the space that must be
given up for the rooms, the loss
in revenue for the college will
be about $50,000.

Alexander emphasized that
the timing this year was per

fect in view of the demise ol
the union. “The administration
has felt that it had finished re-
novation of the dorms this year,
but its response to the proposals
has been particularly good be-
cause these new dorm facilities
wil! help take up the slack left
by the vanishing role of the
union.”

Both Terry and Nicholls ex-
p essed their support for the
“I'd like to see it
done.’ said Nicholls. “Our
dorms have always been defici
ent in common use area, and
nothing would improve resid
eoce hall life more than these
facilities.”

CAPRICORN,

and good taste.

Dec. 22-Jan. 19°

But just remember, you're shy. And the Bull isn't. So be wary when you take on
the Bull. it may take some adjusting, but you and Schlitz Malt Liquor

Nobody makes malt liquor like Schlitz. Nobody.

Capricorn, the Goat, never defies conventions. And that's why
you've got to take It easy with Schiitz Malt Liquor...
& Taurus, the Bull.

Because The Bull ain't conventional—it’s an unique drink with
Gynamic good taste.

Even though you present a no-nonsense, disciplined exterior to the world,
you've actually got a very gentle soul—romantic and poetic. But you keep
this submerged and only a chosen few know the real you.

You tend to be a social climber—you admire prestige and success. And when
you get together with these kinds of people, you ask for Schlitz Malt Liquor,
because you know they're bound to be impressed with your discrimination
