cultures and people not beauti-
ful? Which culture is better? If I
live in a “better” culture would
my life be more valid or justifi-
able than if I lived in a “worse”
culture? Must I choose! ?!
Celebrate! Dance! Sing! I love
them all!

They look at.me now with
wonder. I can see it in the awed
frost of their eyes. They don’t
know what to expect from me.
Something profound perhaps,

have I to offer? I have traipsed
across oceans and seas and cities.
What dark monsters have I slain,
during my year abroad?

Abroad. Alone. Culture
shock. What does that mean,
culture shock? It means that all
of a sudden you find yourself
stripped of all you are -- all your
definitions of yourself, all your
ways of comprehending the
world, all your ways of doing
things, all your moral systems.
There you stand, naked in front
of your own eyes, faced with the
tremendous task of establishing
your own lifestyle by yourself.

Wow! How quickly you come to
realize that most of what you
believe about yourself and the
cosmos and your place in society
is founded on the instruction of
your culture. Thought they were
inherent truths? -- wrong. From
where, then, do you find the
answers to your questions?

From yourself! You are alone.

Alone with everybody.
Transcendent of aloneness:
Who’s to say that your answers
are better than mine? Even God
looks different in Germany.
When you are alone, your
decisions are for yourself, not for

your parents, not for your peers,
and not for your society; if, at
least, you open your eyes. You -
-- find you. Who? You and you
and you and you! We all have
one Truth.

Respect is essential and goes
hand in hand with the disposal of
ignorance. There is no place for
individual pride.

Ethnocentricity is a blinder
we wear to create the illusion
that we are better, more valuable,
more important, more just, and
more powerful than others. How
liberating it is to throw off the

blinders, to strip ourselves of
illusion, to realize that all roses
are beautiful! Verily, the
perfume made from the essence
of roses is the sweetest smell
there is! The one who knows
this, is truly rich. He carries
bouquets to dead soldiers.

Little Prince, trans. Katherine
