College Record Broken.

An ideal day favored the Annual In-
ter-Class Track Meet on last Saturday.
The track was in good form, and a
large crowd was present to witness the
events. The competition was keen be-
tween the Juniors and Sophs, and en-
thusiasm ran high, among the Sophs
especially.

The meet was featured by the break-
ing’ of one college record. -Norman
Johnson stepped over 5 feet 10 inches,
the former high jump record being 5
feet 9 inches, made in 1894 by Brown.
Gilchrist broke the former record. on
the 220 yard dash, but did not come up
to his own record of 23 seconds, made
last vear.

Gilchrist was the main point-winner
for the Juniors, securing 18 out of the
total 54. Johnson and Anderson _fol-
lowed close. Currie, Dumas and Perry
“did good work for the Sophs. “Archie”
Young sprung the big surprise of the

day. winning both the mile arid half-|-

mile, and scoring 10 out of the 18 points
for the Freshmen.

The Seniors did not enter the events,
although DuBose vaulted and cleared
the har at 10 feet 2 inchés.

Reunions. --

1909 Already Making Definite
Arrangements.

Special efforts are being made to se-
cure a large number of alymni at com-
mencement. Some of the old classes are
already planning reunions. Georgia
Dormitory will be given over practically
to the returning Davidson men, and it
will no doubt be the scene of a hilarious
and happy renewal of old times and
memories. ‘he class of 1909 is mak-
ing definite arrangements and _reserva-
tions. Mr. H. A. Query, Senior Pres-
ident, is sending out letters on 1909
class stationery to every man. who grad-
uated that year, and is urging him to
join the big reunion on the Hill.

His letter is full of spirit and enthus-
iasm, and should rally every ‘oger:

“Do you realize that it has been five
years since ’09—the best that ever left
the “Hill’’—graduated from Davidson,
fifty-seven strong? Do you not think
that we should get together at the com-
ing Commencement for a big reunion?

¢ tried it two vears ago, but most of
the men could not come.

It seems by this time that the ‘og men
could arrange their affairs so as to be
present from May 16-19. There will
be a big Commencement at Davidson.
Can you not spare a few days and come
back tothe “Hill” for old times’ sake?
We are all wanting you and shall ex-
pect you. A copy of this letter is being
sent to every man in the class whose
address is available.

I sincerely hope that you will come;'

and, if you can, will you drop me a card
to that effect by May 1?”

North Carolina.

Tar Heels Ontclassed at Every
Stage in Fast Game.

Davidson has come into her own.
Yesterday she met the University ot
North Carolina team on Wearn Field,
in Charlotte, and came off victorious
with the big end of a §-0 score. ‘The
University team was outplayed from the
very start. Not a runner advanced be-
yond second base. ‘The Tar Heels were
powerless before “Bill’s” — breaking
curves, three scattered hits in as
many innings being all they could get
off of him. The infield was slow, four
errors being charged up to it. - The
Davidson infield, on the other hand, was
air tight. “Dutch” made two beauti-
ful stops in the seventh inning, and the
rest were a stone wall, “The Red and
Blacks secured five clean hits off the
two Carolina pitches, two uf these being
two-baggers, and one a drive for three

bases by Kluttz in the eighth inning,

bringing in two runs.

Davidson drew. blood first in the
third inning. . Kluttz made first on an
efror. Crayton sacrificed him to  sec-
ond. Stough was up and the Davidson
rooters roared for a hit. Stough doubled
over short, scoring Kluttz. Brown fol-
lowed with a two-bagger and Stough
came‘to third... Williams then tighten-
ed up and retired the next two batters.

Davidson scored again in the fifth.
“Pete” reached first on an error. Stough
got his second hit, putting Pete on sec-
ohd. Curry ran for Crayton and came
to third on Brown's sacrifice. Curry
made .a beautiful steal home. Stough
slid safe at home when “Dutch” hit a
grounder to the pitcher. Elliott follow-
ed and reached first. but died there
when Osteen hit to K. Bailev.

It was a safe lead, but the Davidson
Machine was not. satisfied. In the
eighth Elliott walked. “Then with two
out Christenbury took the sanie route.
Kluttz, followed and drove a slashing
three-bagger to right field, scoring FEI-
Crayton was
out to the pitcher. In the ninth Caro-
lina’s big end was retired in easy order.

The game was one of the fastest and
prettiest college games ever witnessed
in this vicinity. The “Red and Black
Machine” plaved errorless ball until
the last of ninth, when Somerville
stopped a hit, and being off his balance.
