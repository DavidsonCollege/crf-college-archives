Humanities: Students Express Opinions

By BOB HOWELL

Involving annually some 200
students. the Humanities
program evokes a range of
student opinions on its strengths
and weaknesses.

“It gives vou a nice broad sur-
vev of a lot of material. which is
what I want.” said Sophomore
John Randolph.

With emphasis on developing
written and oral expression, the
two-year sequence traces the
history of Western thought from
the beginnings of civilization to
the presert.

“That's part of my com-
plaint.” said Freshman John
Steelv, “Its forced to cover too
much material in too short a
time: it just whets vour appi-
tite.”

The program is statfed by 15
protessors divided between the
two vears. Freshman
Humanities covers material up
to the Renaissance: the
sophomore year continues
through the Renaissance to the
present.

A combination of lectures and
discussion groups. of about 15
students per  protessor.
provides the basic format of-the
course.

‘lt involves a_ lot ol
knowledge.” said Freshman
Tom Brenner. ‘but it takes a Jot
ot ume and a lot of reading .

Second vear Humanities
student Gray Lindsay con-
curred that the work load was
heavy. but supported the survey
aspect ot the program.

Time seems to be a problem
with many in the Humanities
sequence. Bob Mendenhall. a
lirst year student, points out
“Most of the material is
pretty interesting. but it takes a
lot of your time. and doesn't
leave much tor your other cour-
ses"

Pre-medical students may
have added difficulties if they
have lab courses. observed
Sophomore Woody Vam Meter.

“It's been a burden. so |
wouldn't recommend it for all

pre-meds. But I'm glad [ took
u— it's synthesized things I've
had betore and kept me from
being limited to the sciences.”
he explained.

David Boggs. a sophomore
who hopes to go to law school.
said that Humanities could be a
problem for anyone who plans
to enter graduate school.

“It just doesn't help your
grade point average at all.”
Boggs said.

A drawhack seen by some
treshmen is the amount of
student participation in
discussion groups.

“[t is the instructor who
brings out most of the im-
portant points.” noted Tom
Brenner. “It would be better if
students were more actively in-
volved.”

Sophomore students find a
change in this area. “In the
second vear we're given a freer
hand. but with more respon-
sibility.” said Craig
Crosswhite, “such as in leading
class discussions. ”

Other sophomores noted
changes trom the first year.
“Last year the emphasis was to
cover all the material in class.”
explained Randolph ‘Now it’s
mostly up to the student to get it
on his own. ©

“My grade poimt has sul-
fered.’ added Lindsay. “but |
wouldn't have passed up the

As the Humanities sequence
moves toward the end of tls
eleventh year, there seems to
be virtually no sentiment
among the taculty tor extensive
modification ot the program.

Most members ot the
program's staft express
satistaction with “Humes” and
enthusiasm tor its continuation.

“Its a very strong program.”
said Viee President for
Academic Attairs John M.
Bevan. “It speaks more to the
liberal arts theme than
anything else we have.”’

better. and I think it’s one of
those things vou appreciate
more when vou get out of it than
when you're in it.”

But freshmen noted a change.
too. “It's a tremendously big
step from high school to
Humanities.” stressed David
Gordon. “It will help me in the
other programs I'll take. The
readings have heen tremen-

dous.’

In evaluating the program.
many students would make tew
actual changes in the course
structure, although a common
suggestion is more reading
periods.

Sentiment was also voiced for
including Eastern thought.
“Somehow [ think vou should
include Eastern’ cultures.

because vou can't negate half of

‘TAGREE'

the world. | said Steely.

Some students were con-
cerned that the program did not
sutticrently emphasize the arts.
but concentrated too heavily on
history. religion and
philosophy.

“Youre not going to make
straight A‘s.” summarized
Crosswhite. “so vou almost
have to go into Humanities to
enjoy it.”

Humanities Professor Brown Patterson considers student contributions.

Professors Anticipate Few Alterations

Samuel D. Maloney. charr-
man ot the second vear team.
characterized the objectives ot
the program as being two-told

The tirst objective 1s to ae-
quaint the student with his
cultural heritage in the western
tradition. so that he might un-
derstand his contemporary
culture and institutions 1n light
ot their origins. The second is to
evaluate his thoughts and ex-
press and detend them both
orally and in writing.

The Humanities stati sees the
sequence as a survey ot western
thought and institutions. They
teel the general knowledge
gained trom the sequenee
allows a student to specialize
during his junior and senior
years while placing specitie
events in their general
historical context.

“Humanities allows those
who take it to feel at home
wherever they might drop in.”
said Daniel Rhodes. chairman
of the tirst year team

Rhodes said he telt that not
only does Humanities provide a
student’ with a broad
background upon which lo
draw. bul prepares students ior
upper level courses by toreing
them to contribute and par-
ticipate in a discussion group
setting.

However. even those who are
its most enthusiastie supporters
agree that the Humanities
program has some minor
problems.

One which is trequently men-
tioned is the small degree ot
communication between the tir-
st and second vear teams.
Members of both teams feel
that increased communication
between the two stafts would be
beneficial.

“Both staffs should get
together and discuss overall
phiidsophy.”’ said Bevan.

However. none of those
questioned felt that the methods
of approach should be identical.
“LT think it's great that they are

quite ditterent. said Rhodes.
“Students teel they are
tollowing a new course in the
second vear. rather than just a
continuation ot the tinst year

Rhodes added that he “would
hate to come to a point where
either vear is bound oy what the
other 1s doing.

The tremendous amount ot
material which 1s covered by
the sequence is seen by many as
one of the program's
drawbacks

While acknowledging that
there 1s a great deal ot reading
involyed, taculty members
generally teel that the
curriculum has already been
trimmed to the bone. ‘‘We are
tighting a battie ot what we can
include and do a decent job
with,’ observed Rhodes.

Not only has the number ot
class meetings been cut. but the
scope ot the program has been
expanded.

When the program was tirst
begun in the early 195us. the
second vear ended with Worid
War |. The program now con-
cludes with a survey ot the cold
war decades.

The question ot a Humanities
major has been periodically
raised, and is presently looked
upon with something less than
enthusiasm by many or those in-
volved with the program

Maloney said he would hike to
promote the . idea ot
Humanities major which would
involve adding a program of
non-Western study. and an ‘‘in-
tercultural experience” such as
Jumor Year Abroad. to the
present humanities core.

Many of the faculty do not »
such a program as practical. °
would hesitate to require a
student to take three vears of
Humanities.” said second vear
staff member W. Brown Pat-
terson. “It might unnecessarily
restrict him.”

Rhodes said he would want
such a program only if it could
“probe below the surtace. 1
don't think that just another

a

sunvey course would ustify a
major.

Virtualiy no one tavors in-
cluding non-Western study as a
part ot the present Humanities
program. “Its possible towater
down a program too much.’
said George Labban. a member
ot the tirst year team

Members of the Humanities
statt see no Major moditieation
in the immediate tuture. *'] like
it the way itis. said Patterson
“We should just’ keep
reevaluating it.”

The Humanites sequence is
evaluated periodically by its
statt. The second year team
meets every spring to discuss
the previous vear and to plan
the svilabus tor the coming
year.

Maloney estimates that ap-
proximately 10 pereent ot the
reading materials are changed
each vear. and attributes the
turnover to the tact that a great
amount of material ts available
tor the modern periods of
history. ot which the classics
are not yet clearly detined

In contrast to the turnover ot
men and material in the second
year. the first year has
remained virtually intaet since
it began in 1962. Rhodes does
not see this as evidence o1 a '‘a
sacred cow syndrome” as one
student charged but as a retlec-
tion that the possible choices
are more readily apparent for
the classical era.
