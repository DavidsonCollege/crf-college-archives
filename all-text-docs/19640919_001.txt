Freshmen
Camp Is
‘Best Yet’

One hundred freshmen and
nineteen upperclassmen  con-
fronted the subject, ‘“‘The Voca-
tion of a Student,” at the fourth
annual Davidson Freshman
Camp. Held at Camo Stewart,
a 60-acre tract 10 miles east
of Charlotte, the camp met dur-
ing the three-day period prior
to Freshman Orientation. ;

The keynote speaker was Dr.
John Oliver Nelson, formerly
at Yale University for 15 years.
Nelson has written a prayer
book for college students and
owns a retreat center for
church leaders and students.
His address empaasized the
unity that a student must make
of his life in the academic and
world-at-large communities.

Camp Director Alex Bern-
hardt assembled 19 campus
leaders for the enterprise. To-
gether they represented every
major activity at Davidson.
Some shared their ideas form-
ally with the freshmen, as when
Rick von Unwerth, Steve
Bunch, Rufus Halimark, Lewis
Norman, and Ed Haselden parti-
cipated in a pane! discussion of
“Social Life at Davidson.” This
subject was not directly treat-
ed during Orientation.

Professors also outlined
something of what the frehmen
would meet in the next four
year. Drs. W. O. Puckett, W.
G. McGavock, W. G. Workman
and F. W. Bliss tried to answer
the question, “What Do I Ex-
pect of My Students?”

Speaking of his impression of
the camp's effectiveness, Chap-
Jain Will H. Terry said, “I think
it was the best one of the. three
in the three years I've been
connected with it.”

the annual “Great Issue” series
in chanel on Tuesday, Septem-
ber 22. This year’s program jis
entitled ‘Political Campaign:
1964.” Speakers this year in-
clude peonle from diverse fields
of polities.

Dr. Triffin has been profes-
sor of economies at Yale since
1951. He has written a number
of articies and a book dealing
with the worid economy:
Hlusion of the Internationa!
Monetary System. Referred to
as a “world shaker.” Triffin
is an economic scientist and
one who has developed a re-
vo:utionary economic idea on
a global scale. He has served
in advisory capacties to many
countries and was a member of
President Kennedy's task force
on the balance of. payments
committee.

Political Campaign: 1964 is
designed to rresent and discuss
the issue of the coming elec-
tion rather than the personali-
ties of the political hopefuls.

It will open with a series of
talks by scholarly members of
the political field. such as
Davidson's Drs. Secor and
Patterson. Dr. Marshall Shul-
man Of Harvard, chairman of
the Russian Research Center,
will be on campus, in addition
to others as yet unannounced.

After this introduction to the
campaign it is hoped that an
inside. yiew of the political
arena.) may be afforded by
various holders of office and
others who are closely associat-
ed with the candidates. Gover-
nor George Wallace of Alabamz
and Senator Jennings Randolph
of West Virginia are two of
the speakers already committ-
ed to Davidson.

Fred Sackett, chairman of
the “Great Issues” comunittee,
hopes to have a current his-
torian, a well-known news com-
mentator, and an author (pos-
sibly Theodore White-Making
of the President: 1960) present
a resume of the election as the
conclusion of the program.

“203 Freshmen Pledge

Greek Chapters Today

73 Percent Of Class
Take Traditional Walk

Two hundred and three freshmen stolled down Patterson Fraternity Court this

afternoon as Greeks rushed out from their 12 doorways to greet them. This represents
approximately 73 percent of the Class of 1968. .
Cheers went up seconds after 3

e

. m. when the first freshman indicated his

choice and continued until pledging closed at 4:30. The pledging period was preceded
by a period of silence which went into effect last night at 10 o'clock. No rushee
could have further contact with any fraternity man until the close of pledging this

afternoon.

Today’s pledging brought to a close one of the most hectic Rush Weeks in re-
cent years as both semester classes and rush parties conflicted throughout part of the
week. The first series of parties ran through Wednesday night with two nights of re-

dates Thursday and Friday.

The 73 percent figure is slightly smaller than the comparable figure last fall
when 195 or roughly 75 percent pledged fraternities at the conclusion of Rush Week.
On the other hand, the figure is slightly larger than the 59 percent figure of two years
ago when 182 freshmen pledged on Pledge Saturday.

P. Nicholls Duo Sports
Marine Corps Savvy

By BOB STRAUSER

Davidsonian Feature Editor

’The 1964 edition of the college community reveals two new faces in the hus-
band-wife team of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Nicholls. Already known to many as the own-
er of a variety store on the lower end of Main Street, Nicholls now manages the com-
bined book store-student store in the new wing of the Union; his wife is the new sup-

ervisor of dormitories.

Nicholls, a reformed “damn
Yankee” by admission, has liv-
ed in Davidson a little over
a year and in Charlotte for
three and one-half years pre-
vious to that. His work in re-
tail salés with Franklin - Simon
department stores brought him
south from New Jersey, his
home state and place of res-
idence for most of his life.

“This is a new business for
me,” said Nicholls, “but I’m
catching on pretty fast.” He

went on to note that there have
been no basic changes in the
operations of activities in the
Union wing. “We want this to
be a place where students can
browse and congregate but at
the same time we want to show
a profit.”

From her office in Belk mean-
while, Mrs. Nicholls encounters
the Davidson student in a com-
pletely different capacity. Com-
menting on her approach to
what can be a very trying job,

MRS. P. NICHOLLS

she said, “I knew Mrs. Moore
and the sentiment she enjoyed
among the student body. It
would. be a difficult job filling
her shoes, so I brought my
own.”

Mrs. Nicholls is assisted in
her work by Mrs. Harmon Gil-
lespie, a Mooresville native
whose husband works for Caro-
lina Freight Company in Char-
lotte.

Washington, D. C., provided
the background against which
Nicholls met his future wife,
a native Pennsylvanian. They
were both serving in the Marine
Corps, she having just recent-
ly graduated from Park College
in Missouri with a language
degree. “The Marine Corps was
my only other experience work-
ing with men as I do here,”
said Mrs. Nicholls, “and it has
proven to be very enjoyable
work.”

In addition to memories, the
Nicholls family has accumulat-
ed over the years four children
— ranging in age from four to
sixteen.

Both husband and wife in-
dicated that they felt Davidson
to be an ideal place in which
to make their home. Nicholls
pointed out the growth poten-
tial of the area, the convenient
facilities and the recreational
opportunities, as deciding fac-
tors in his move here last year.
The latest additions to the
‘Davidson family” seem to feel

they have made a good choice.

Drama
Auditions
Will Begin

Tryouts for Shakespeare’s
Coriolanus, the first Drama
production of the season,
will be held in Hodson Hall
on Monday, Sept. 21, and
Tuesday, Sept. 22, begin-
ning at 7:30 p. m.

All students are eligible to
try out. Experience is not
necessary.

The cast is large, demand-
ing at least 30 men and five
women and the number
could easily grow to 50. Along
with about 12 major roles there
are many excellent character
parts. Also many extras will be
needed in the production.

Scheduled for the first. week
in November, it is a political
tragedy, the story of a com
pletely honest and courageous
man seeking public office. His
refusal to play the “politician”
and pacify the common people
leads him ultimately to the
tragic conclusion.

Neglected for many years,
Coriolanus has been making
a successful come-back in the
theatre recently with such
actors as Olivier, Burton and
Quayle in the title role.

Rehearsals will be conducted
on a scene basis, so that only
the people involved with the
scenes ‘will have to be at re-
hearsal.

The procedure for tryouts
will be different from the pat-
tern yreviously set in that only
certain scenes will be read.
These will be Act If Scenes i.

Program Is Effective

Advisor John Barrow Said

“These things have been left
to the hall counselors and to
the Activities Fair this year.
By doing this, we thought we'd
concentrate on a _ broader
theme.”

With Dean of Students. Rich-
ard C. Burts, Barrow settled
on “Davidson — A Statement
of Purpose” as the period's
central subject. The college's
statement of purpose provided
a working basis. For each of
the four sections in the Trus-
tee’s draft, a corresponding
address was delivered. .

The college sent information
sheets bearing a copy of the
document and a list: of suggest-
ed summer réading to all fresh-
men and to their group leaders
in preparation for the six-day
session.

Freshmen began checking in
at the College Union on Thurs-
day, September 10, receiving
their name tags and dormitory
assignments. On the same day,
those interested took special
exams in engineering, biology
and chemistry. These were used
in determining their future
courses of study.

In the evening the Fresh-
men attended a welcoming ban-
quet and heard remarks from
President of the College D.
Grier Martin and a speech on
“Davidsoniana” by history Pro-
fessor C. G. Davidson.

Dr. George C. Buttrick of
Garrett Seminary in Evanston,
Til., delivered an address the
next day on ‘Christian Com-
mitment.” A question and an-
swer period followed. “I've
been impressed by this fresh-
man class in several ways. espe-
cially by their intellectual capa-
cities as they demonstrated
them with Buttrick,” Advisor
Barrow said of this experience.

providing additional guidance.
The discussions did not work
out ideally in this first year.
One group leader Teported that
“nothing happened” in his
group, but another told of one
interested freshman who spark-
ed the others into participation.

Group discussions also fol-
lowed the three remaining talks.
Dr. D. D. Rhodes of the Bible
Department substituted for the
Scheduled speaker, Dr. W. Cc.
Archie of the N. C. State Board
of Higher Education. Rhodes
spoke Saturday on “A Com-
munity of Learning.”

On Monday Dr. Paul Clyde
of the Duke Endowment in Dur-
ham spoke on “Educational in
the Liberal Arts,” and on Tues-
day Dean of Faculty F, W.
Johnston completed the. quartet
of addresses with “Challenge.”

Dr. Philip B. Secor provided
a supplementary talk on “Poli-
ties: 1964.”

ACTIVITIES FAIR

Friday night in the Union.
various campus organizations
were represented with booths
in the Activities Fair. This was
the freshman's primary source
of information about the oppor-
tunities open tb him in such
things as the choral groups,
the campus publications, and
the honorary fraternities.

Saturday night was the
Queens-Davidson freshman mix-
er at Queens College in Char-
lotte.

As the Orientation period
drew to a close, Barrow had
words of praise for Dean Burts.
‘Earlier I thought this was go-
ing to be the kind of thing that
I would be glad to be over with.
but he has put the program
together so effectively and
worked out the details so
smoothly that I'll be sorry to be
finished with Orientation.”
