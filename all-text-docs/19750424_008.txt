Eastern vacation provides hectic relief

By JULIUS S. WINKLER
Professor of German

“More is worse,” Anthony
Burgess quotes Kingsley Amis
in an article published some
time ago in the New York Times
Magazine. I think it was the
same article in which Burgess
pleased more readers than one
by referring to Hermann Hesse
as ‘‘that dubious orientalist.”’

In the old days, motorists
abroad within a 200 mile radius
of Chattanooga were im-
portuned to See Rock City. It
was as if the See Rock City
people had hired 95 percent of
the commercial billboards in
any given area, along with sides
and roofs of barns.

Ruby Falls had the other 5
percent. There have been some
substantial changes. There are
a lot more rock cities in a lot
more places.

Ghost Town

If I had not been so slow-
witted back when they were
bulldozing that mountain top to
build Ghost Town I might have
written a song called Smoky
Mountain High and Julius
Waynesville would be at the top
of the record heap.

About ten years ago we made
a final flurry at summertime
camping in the Smokies. Turned
away at Smokemont and thus
deprived of our best chance to
find out whether Cherokee’s
hearlded Dancing Chicken
really was a gall--inaceous fowl
or just a twinkle-toed coward,
we were slowing suffocating in
the effluvium of an A&P diesel
carrying the good life to Bryson
City.

Suddenly beside the road
cropped up one of those hand-
lettered signs indigenous to the
area. ‘‘Where,”’ it queried, ‘‘will
you spend eternity?”’

“Not behind an A&P truck
halfway between Cherokee and
Bryson City,’”’ was the  in-
stantaneous consensus, and
back down the mountain we
came. Some years later, up in
Rolling Rock beer country, we
saw a chicken in a glass en-
closure.

Drop a nickel in the slot and,

bird did his routine, which was
to look exactly like a chicken
dancing. For his livelihood. A
pro.

The summer we discovered a
worse blot on humankind’s
escutcheon than Maggie Valley

began sylvanly enough near
Watkins Glen, in the Finger
Lakes Region.

The people in the site next to
ours had one of those trailers
that suggest a giant siver
watermelon, or perhaps a

steamed pudding pan. At any.

rate, they displayed a little
wooden notched-end sign, into
which had been carefully burned
the.information that these were
the Friendly Freemans, out of
King of Prussia, Pa.

Naturally we never

exchanged a word with them.

One day, having tired of wat-
ching the three inch rainbow
trout in Catherine Creek savage
my expensive dry flies, I retur-
ned to the campground to be
greeted by the middle child
with, ‘‘Guess what, Dad!”’

Lake George

I well knew by then that guess
what was shorthand for guess,
she continued, ‘‘Benno (our
Geman shepherd) bit a Frien-
dly Freeman.”’

I don’t even like to think about
what might have ensued if he
had biten a Pugnacious Putnam

or a Bellicose Ballew.
Now the town of Lake George,
New York, cannot perform

miracles. It canot, by com-
parison, make Maggie -Valley
look good in any sense of the
word. But it comes close.

A certain campground at
Lake George rated four stars in
a certain guidebook to camp-
grounds. Four start meant you
were the best you could be and
that, among other things, en-
tertainment was close by.

within walking distance.

Lured thither by those four
stars, what we saw from the car
was not all that enticing: your
basic flat field with a few scrub
firs scattered here and there.
Across the street from the en-

trance was, obviously, the en-
tertainment: something called
Gay Nineties Village.

I asked the attendant at a
nearby gas station if it was a
good palce to camp. It was all
right, he allowed, except on the
nights when Gay Nineties
Villagers got a little too much to
drink and walked over and set
the tents on fire.

Banks of the Hudson

This gave the concept of .en-
tertainment a new dimension,
granted but we camped
elsewhere, twenty miles
elsewhere, on the banks of the
Hudson above its first major
polluter.

But life will have its little
ironies: such a rain set in that
Ivar Kreuger would not have
had enough matches to ignite a
tent. ¢

George and Maggie have a
German cousin. His name it
Titisee and his abode is high in
the mountains of the Black
Forest. Here West and East

have married perfectly and
their issue is for sale: little
cuckoo clocks made in Hong
Kong.

They are called two day
clocks because that is about
how long they last after being
removed from the enchanted
atomsphere of Titisee.

Meanwhile, there we sat in
our costly motor--termed
variously a Travelawful or a
Travailall—in the rain at a Mc-
Donald’s or whatever in upstate
New York.

Parked facing us was a big
Buick plastered with Gay
Nineties Village and similar
bumperstickers. ‘‘Look, Dad,’’
said a seven year old voice,
“that car has been to six dif-
ferent crap towns.”’ Thus are
definitions born.

To get back to the beginning--
if it is true, what Anthony
Burgess said Kingsley Amis
said, then it is a good thing I
don’t have more time to spend
on this piece.
