Plant panaceas prove

toturn dorm into jungle “\,

By ANN GARNER
Staff Writer

Indoor plants are the source of
more agony and pain among freshmen
than almost any review, for to pack
off to school with an abundance of
exotic plants, only to watch them day
by day wither up and die is often more
traumatic than any college ‘‘adjust-
ment.’’ However, there are many
plants that can survive any college
experience and can do so quite
heartily.

To have a room with bright
sunlight is often to your advantage.
Plants do not often need direct
sunlight, yet many do require
“brightness” in order to do well.

Wandering Jew and Swedish Ivy
are both trailing plants and make
good hanging baskets. They tend to
thrive best in cooler places and best of

all, trailings from these plants can be

broken off and rooted in water,
making great spur-of-the moment
gifts.

Another good hanging plant that
does not require much light is the
spider plant, which has a runner that
not only blossoms but also. produces
infant plants.

Any plant that flowers is special
but usually needs an abundance of
light. Virtually impossible to kill, a

wax begonia needs light in order to
flower. However, it can do just as will
under a lamp as in a window.

Jerusalem Cherry and Pepper
Plants flower and then form small
(and nonedible) cherries and peppers.
Although tempermental at times,
they usually do best in lighted
windows ‘and in cooler temperatures.
These are most healthy during the
winter.

Even if you are not blessed with a
great amount of sunshine, there are
many plants that live best with a
minimum of light. Trailing Philoden-
dron is one that can make it quite well
in almost any obscure corner with a
nearby lamp.

Succulent plants can even be left
over Thanksgiving and probably
Christmas break without any atten-
tion.

Jade trees require little water and
grow and prosper in a cool place
without too much sun.

By putting an avacado seed in a jar
of water, broad side down, it will root
in four to six weeks, sprout, and can
be planted in another four weeks.

If not smothered with too much
attention, plants can be the envy of
every hallmate and the horror of every
parent, as you try to ship a veritable
jungle home for the summer.

Ailey Il begins Series

By DAVE KELLER
Features Editor

The Ailey II Dance Company, first
act of this year’s Artist Series, will
be performing in Love Auditorium
‘Thursday, October 21, at 8 pm.

These young dancers, protéges of
the Alvin Ailey City Center Dance
Theatre (many of whom will even-
tually join that company), have been
performing nationwide in schools,

prisons, and other settings which are
too small for the larger company;
recently they appeared on a CBS
television special entitled ‘‘Alvin Ail-
ey Celebrates Duke Ellington”.

Dance magazine said of the com-
pany: “‘exciting, ...it whips the
audience into a frenzy the way the
first company does.”

The performance will be free to
students with an ID.
