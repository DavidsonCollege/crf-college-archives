Expert On India
Warily Optimistic

Dr. Ed. B. Jones, coordina
tor of Asian-African studies
at Furman University, spoke
in assembly Tuesday on the
twenty years of Indian in-
dependence. :

Jones has been in India
twice. His studies were sub-
sidized by grants from the
Fulbright Foundatioh and
the American Institute of In
dian Studies.

Jones is optimistic about
India, Steps are being taken
towards controling popula-
tion and freeing agriculture,
from its dependence upon
monsoon rains, Jones said.
The average life expectancy
has risen from 32 years in
1947 to 50 years today. ac-
cording to Jones.

India has been described
as a land of ‘‘children with.

out bread. men without
work. and women without
hope.”’ Indians suffer from
malnutrition. disease. ‘the
world’s worst slums,"" and
little economic opportunity.
Jones said.

The annual per capita in-
come is less than eighty
dollars. _

According to Jones, great
population is ‘‘perhaps the
most crucial problem in In-
dia today.”

With a probable popula.
tion of 600 million, India con-
tains 14% of the world popu-
lation. Only 30% of these
people are literate. Gains
made in the areas of food
production and income are
always counted by an annual
increase of 13 million peo-
ple. Jones said.

Davidson’s Oldest
Finding New Life

By STEVE CROSS
Staff Writer

‘The Philanthropic and Eu
menean Literary Societies
are the two oldest organiza-
tions on th; Davidson Col-
lege campus 2hd two of the
least-known as well.

“The Phi Society. founded
in 1837, was a literary and
debating society. and a great
influence on campus life un
til the 1890s... said Robert
Bryan.

Bryan is the “agent” for
the Philanthropic Society.
“That means I'm program
chairman and _ jack.of-all
trades,"" he said

The Phi Society collabo.
rated with the Eu society to
publish the first yearbook
and the first literary maga-
zine. ana was the nearest
thing on campus to a stu.
dent government, according
to Bryan.

With the advent of student
government in the 1890s and
the introduction® of Greek
letter fraternities in the
1920s. the literary societies
fost so much power and ine-
fluence thet they nearly dis
disappeared. According to
Bryan, no records survive
of the Philanthropic Socie-
ty’s activities from the twen.
ties to the forties.

An unsuccessful attempt to
revive the Phi society five
years ago left it just as mori-

bund as before. Last year,
it had only two active mem.
bers: Heyward Whetsell and
Bill Sosaman. The Phi group
has inducted members twice
and now has_ twenty three
people.

Last Tuesday. Dr. T. A.
Williams of the French De.
partment lectured the group
on “The Elements of Para
psychology.’’ The Phi Socie-
ty is now preparing to in

PRAM's good standing with
the State Department.

Until last year Ehlers, a
former Davidson _ student.
was the head of the Latin
American arm of PRAM.
However, over the past year
he has become increasingly
involved in Ecuadorian poli-
tics, At present. Ehlers is
President of the Socialist
Party in Ecuador.

This, according to Parks.
has caused him to neglect
the PRAM_ organization,
limiting the exchange pro-
gram. Raul Bolanos, a Rich-
ardson Scholar here last
year, has carried on some
part-time work for PRAM in
Ehlers’ absence but has been
unable to carry the full load.

Ehlers has not formally se-
parated himself from PRAM.
Parks said his actions thus
could cause the State De
partment to blacklist PRAM.
Recently Ehlers hds begun
injecting anti - American
statements into his speeches.
according to Parks.

Ehlers’ statements and the
possibility that he is associ
ated with Ecuadorian gueril.
las is against the PRAM po.
licy of having no political af-
filations. According to PRAM
Director Blake Anderson,

itself.

Another possible course of

The Davidson College Li-

ber of volumes per student
among North Carolina col.
lege and universities. the
N. C. Leader of Raleigh re-

mission says. the quality of

ing universities .will decline
almost beyond _ retrieval:
and they will become unable
to open their doors to stu-
dents who cannot pay exor-
bitant tuition fees.

A major guilding premise
of the Commission report is
that as long as most of socie-
ty is going to regard diplo-
ma as a ticket to jobs an eco-
nomic security, higher edu-
cation must be made avai-
lable to many more poor
students.

Taking in all those stu.

sible solution, but not while
the colleges are organized as
they are today. ‘Letting
them in’’ and then flunking
them out because they don't
understand what is going on
there is not a solution.

Before this plan can be ad-
opted colleges will have to
develop programs to accli-
mate these students to col-
lege, to train them in some
skills they do not have. but
more important, to change
the college inio an institution
compatible with American
subcultures and minority
races.

DONT
LOOK
NOW

But you
may be about
to blow
your life

A. astonishing number of

people make a stupid and tragic
mistake. To put it simply, they
jump into careers without really
looking. The result—a dreary life
of frustration and anger.

Can this happen to you? Could
be—unless you can answer ques-
tions like these to your own satis-
faction before you make your move:

Are you really a Chief...or an
Indian?

Do you belong in a big organi-
zation? Or a small one? Or do you
belong by yourself?

Can you really stand pressure?

There are a great many serious
questions you must ask—and an-
swer—about a career. But the most
critical are the ones you ask your-
self about you. Unless you can an-
swer them honestly, it makes little
sense to ask, for cxatnple, ‘‘What’s
it really like to be an investment
banker?”

Careers Topay can tell you
what it’s like to be an investment
banker. More important, this
meaningful new magazine can help
you decide whether becoming an

investment banker is even a scn-

sible option for you in the first
place!

It’s a magazine about careers
that starts not with jobs, but with
peopie. And it's dedicated to the
proposition that you must do your
own thing...and that if you don't,
you run the grave risk of blowing
your life.

Careers Topay is relevant. For
people who are searching...from
people who have discovered how to
do their own thing.

How about you? Could you use
a lithe truth at this point in your
search?
