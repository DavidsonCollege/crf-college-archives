THE DAVIDSONIAN

Belek > PICKS OF

THE WEEK

Wildcat game of the

week:

Baseball vs. Duke .
Sunday at 2:00 p.m. at Belk Stadium

When these two teams met at Davidson
earlier in the season, Rob Wilson ’07 pitched
a gem of a game, recording the 3-2 victory.
Unfortunately, the ’Cats have not been play-
ing nearly as well lately, as they are in the
middle of a seven-game losing streak. Still,
this Sunday's game is the last home game of
the school year, so the "Cats would like to go

not to sit back and watch a little baseball on
the last lazy Sunday afternoon of the year.
Outside the Den:

Kings vs. Mavericks, Game 5
Thursday at 10:30 p.m. on TNT

With the Mavs down 3-1, Dirk, Steve, and
Michael cerainly have their backs against the
wall. Still, Sacramento’s offense seems stag-
nant at times, and the Kings are certainly
vulernable as the team continues to mix and
match rotations in an attempt to find ones
that work well together. Also, Dallas is no
stranger to this situation, as you can remem-
ber last year when they were up 3-0 against
the Blazers and then proceeded to lose three
hat did Nowitzki do in game
seven, in the face of adversity? He shot 52
percent from the field for 32 points to go
along with 11 rebounds. Can Dirk do it again
this year? We'll just have to wait and see.

SPORTS

It’s been a pretty good year for sports at
Davidson. The men’s soccer team made it all
the way to the NCAA tournament, taking
down top teams like Duke and South Caro-
lina along the way. Meanwhile, the field
hockey team won seven straight games — their
longest streak in over a decade — en route to
their first ever Norpac division title.
Speaking of streaks, men’s basketball
won all 13 of their games in Belk arena
on their way to a first place finish in
the South division of the SoCon.

The spring has seen some impres-
sive Wildcat performances as well.
Women’s tennis won a team-record
eight games in the Southern Confer-
ence this year. And baseball, their re-
cent losing streak aside, has beaten
some of the best teams in the country
this season.

Seeing Davidson take out teams like
Duke, Wake Forest, and no. 22 Col-

lege of Charleston on our home turf should ,
be enough to make any student here whip out

acell phone to call up any friends unfortunate
enough to attend these esteemed universities
and boast with pride.

That’s one of the best things about the sports
here. We might go to a “highly selective inde-
pendent liberal arts college for [only] 16,000
students,” but we take on some of the best —
and biggest — schools in the country. More
importantly, every once in a while we show
that we can and will take them out. It’s very
refreshing to anyone who’s ever fallen victim
to a “you go where?” or “that’s in Pennsylva-
nia (or Ohio), right?” to be able to say — even

for just a night —- The Blue Who? The Deacon

“What?

That’s right, we’re not Stu-Pid (what a sat-
isfying sore-loser salute), and our athletes can
hold their own against your juiced up jocks,

+ too — then go home and churn out a fifteen-

pager.

And the best is yet to come. Many of our
top players will be around for another year —
or two, or three. Four of the top five batting
averages on the baseball team belong to sopho-
mores; the other to a junior. Field hockey’s
top four scorers will be back next year. The
Fillnow twins (juniors) might be the best
doubles tandem to grace Covington Courts,
and they dominate in singles, too (a combined
35-19 on their own this year). Kate Levitt ’07
was SoCon player of the month in March. The
team will graduate just one player. So will la-
crosse.

The wrestling team has bounced back from
near extinction in the last two years, and it

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 28, 2004

now boasts two extremely strong classes of
sophomores and freshmen. By the time the
next two recruiting classes arrive, the team will
have made a complete turnaround.

Our best four golfers are freshmen and
sophomores. So are some of bur best runners
and swimmers. Et cetera. '

Men’s basketball will see all five
of its top scorers return to the floor
next season. Three of them are sopho-
mores — including all-conference se-
lection Brendan. Winters, who could
become the best player in the SoCon
by the time he’s a senior. They’ ll be
back in the NCAA tourney before I
graduate (in 2006).

I'll be there screaming as loud as I
can. I hope there will be a lot of you
there yelling with me. As the level of
play of the teams here increases, so
should the level of intensity in the
stands. The best part of beating all the
teams I just mentioned is gloating about it —
while it’s happening. And the best part of los-
ing is being sore about it. Make the other team
know you’re there. More importantly, make
the other people who go to school here — and
the athletes who are out playing even though
they have just as much work as you do — know
it too.

Get out of the library and to the games on
weeknights. Roll out of bed and to the field
on weekends. Tailgate. Get excited, and be
loud. Remember that pre-gaming implies that
you’re going to a game afterwards. So go.

Little Rascals of the Sports World: a vignette

Something a little different this week. If you
were hoping for more streakers I apologize.

I'd like to dedicate this to my editors Peter _

and Mike.

Little Rascals
(Three boys walk-
- ing home from
_ school)

Boy 1: What do
F ya'll want to do?

| Boy 2: Why don’t
/ you show us your
* new house?

Boy 3: Yeah. I
want to check out
that Playboy collec-
tion I’ve been hear-
ing about.

(They enter Boy
; 1’s house.)

Boy 2: Can I bring

hia,

these almonds with me?
Boy 1: Yeah, whatever.
(All three enter bedroom.)
Boy 3: This is tight, especially the big bed.

REY

Where those Playboys?

Boy 1: Check the bottom drawer.

Boy 3: Ooooh, I like this centerfold, all in
her nurse outfit. Delish!

Boy 2: Too bad you’ ll never marry a woman

that pretty unless you pay her. Baseball play-
ers like me get the best women. e

Boy 1: (To Boy 2) Silence your baby-voice
please. B-ball players get the finest women,
everyone knows this.

Boy 3: I’m keeping this issue, aight?

Boy 1: No way, my dad will find out.

Boy 3: It’s all right. ll never get caught.

(Boys enter new room.)

Boy 1:Check it, this room gots the big
screen, the bar, and my new squirt gun collec-
tion.

Boy 2: How’s this one work? (Points to
squirt gun.)

Boy 1: Like this, see. I’ll hit that window.
Bang.

Boy 3: Yeah, yeah, so cool. Can we play
ball now?

Boy 2: If ya’ll are gonna play ball then I’m
gonna bounce. My godfather and me are hit-

ting at the cages tonight.

Boy 1: Naw man, stick around, I thought
we were all having dinner here.

Boy 2: What you having?

Boy 1: | think the Beef, Tuna, and Chicken
casserole.

Boy 2: That sounds perfect, but lets keep
this a secret, | don’t want my folks knowing
that I’m eating all this meat.

Boy 3: Can we play already?

Boy 1: If you want to lose so badly, then
yeah, let’s play.

Boy 3: Oh no, my dad said that I am the
best 13-year-old he’s ever seen.

Boy 1: Big deal. I played with the
Globetrotters last weekend.

Boy 2: Yeah, I guess I'll just chill over here.

Boy 1: Play some pinball. See if you can
set a new record.

Boy 3: Check.

(Boys 1 and 3 begin to play basketball)

Boy 1: AHHHH! My leg! I think it is bro-
ken. .

Mom: (yells) Jayson, Barry, Kobe! Dinner
time! -

Ah, the sports section. It’s the first, and of-
ten times the only, part of the morning paper I
turn to. Judging by the piles of USA Today’s
and Observer’s littered about the Union on any
given day, it seems as though you people feel
the same way.

SportsCenter runs on repeat in my house to
the point where my daily life seems to be nar-
rated by Dan Patrick and Stuart Scott, and I’m
sure some of you share a similar problem. At
dinners and lunches, between classes and in
the car, my friends and I talk almost exclu-
sively about sports, girls, and food, and I
wouldn’t believe anyone who told me they
don’t talk about their team every single day.

Let’s face it, we’re a culture and school

Rat:
obsessed, perhaps unhealthily, with sports. For
its part, I think the Davidsonian does a fine
job putting together a sports section geared
specifi-
cally to-
wards
athletics
here at
Davidson,
but with
a little
national
flavor as

- well. Sure, some of you may complain that

the columnists tend to talk about Boston and
New York all too often, but practically the only
people who offer columns each week are from
the Northeast. (Speaking of which, the Red
Sox swept the Yankees in New York last week-

end.)

It’s not that we’ve monopolized this sec-
tion; it’s just that no one else seems to write.
Personally, I’d
like to hear
about how
other people
from other parts
of the country
feel about
sports, and if I
were you, I’d
probably be
sick of my pro-Boston crap too.

Columns are not hard to put together; this
one will take me maybe 30 minutes, and I’m
doing it while watching TV and eating a deli-
cious turkey sub from the Union. (By the way,
