current position,’’ Kaylor said.

As for Williamson's talk,
Kaylor thought that he iden-
tified the college and the church
too closely. ‘‘I think that he
would like to see a college like
Davidson become a church.

‘‘He speaks from a very con-
servative theological stand-

point which is not particularly
helpful in getting at the issues
of the college in the present
day,”’ added Kaylor.

“The value of both Speakers
was that they wanted us to take
seriously our Christian com-
mitment,’’ Kaylor observed.
“The question is what form it
should take.

“They said that the form
should remain constant, but I
feel that our form should
change even while our com-
mitment stays the same,”’ said
Kaylor.

“It was a disappointing day
for me,”’ he said. “‘I felt that
both speakers were telling us to
maintain the status quo they
supposed existed here.

“I'm afraid the only thing
they really did was to confirm
the idea a large number of
trustees hold. instead of
challenging us to see things in a
new perspective.

“I would hope. however. to
have more opportunities to
discuss this situation with the
trustees." Kaylor said.

Philosophy Professor Earl

was “‘very surprised to find

“I agree that if all faculty
members were non-Christian, it
would be just as much a
peetinition against discussing

Position advocating the
Christian faith as we have now
a prohibition against tenured
faculty members advocating an
alternative to the Christian
faith,’’ he said.

“Too often Davidson College
is viewed as if it were a chuch
rather than as a church-related
college where various points of
view can be debated,’’ Mac-
Cormac asserted.

‘I do not believe that sincere
Christians are so insecure that
they are unwilling to meet the
challenges of their critics and
opponents,”’ he concluded.

‘Dr. Williamson gave an im-
pressive deliverance of such an
unpopular viewpoint and did it
very forcibly,” wasthecomment
of Spanish Professor Thomas
Rogerson. ‘‘The man was
aware that he was making an
unpopular opinion, but he did it
magnificently.”

As to Dr. Fry's speech,

Rogerson felt that he “‘couldn’t
assimilate the man’s con-
clusions from his lecture.”

Economics Professor C.
Louise Nelson declined to com-
ment on either of the two
speakers, saying that it was a
‘controversial subject’’, but ad-
ded, ‘‘What we're trying to do is
come up with approximate
solutions to insoluable
problems."’
