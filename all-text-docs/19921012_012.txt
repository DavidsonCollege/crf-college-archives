Due to Fall Break, The

Movie Review: Singles

By Scott McLean
Finally, after a season of big

name features that turned out to be’

big name bombs, a feature film
with no, major stars manages to
come in and breath some life into
the movie industry that seems to
have gotten itself stuck in a rut as

* of late. ‘Writer/director Cameron

Crowe’s “Singles,” the story ofa
group of Seattle twenty-some-
things looking for love ina big city
has arrived just in time to remind
me that Hollywood is capable of
releasing a film that is funny, intel-

__ligent, and gives you enough gritty

realism to make you think about
your own place on this big ole ball
we call Earth while still entertain-
ing you - Thank the Lord for small
miracles.

As the movie opens, Linda
(Kyra Sedgewick; nothing comes
to mind right now that she was in
recently, but ‘you'll recognize her
from somewhere), an enviromental
task force worker, is excited about
finally moving into her own place
with its own private parking. Al-
though she is not looking for a
relationship, she gets connedintoa
relationship only to get her heart

broken causing her to swear off
men for good. Zip over to Steve
(Campbell Scott, that guy with Julia
Roberts in “Dying Young”) who
works with the Department of
Transportation and who finds him-
self floundering after just breaking
up with his longtime girlfriend.

Then, we have Janet (Bridget

Fonda) who is trying to figure out
why her musician boyfriend Cliff

(Matt Dillon) isn’t as crazy about

her as she is about him. Itis really
hard to give a summary here, but
sufficed to say that it is all about
the trials and tribulations ofa bunch
of young, ripe, single folks in their
prime on the lookout for love in a
big evil city with danger and heart-
break lurking ‘round every corner.
The film tells the story of how they
look after each other and draw
strength and inspiration from one
another - kind of like a“‘St. Elmo’s
Fire” meets the show that was on
MTV about all those people who
lived in that apartment together,
“The Real World,” except differ-
ent.

Anyway, what sets this flick
apart from others like itis the depth
of talent that it possesses.

Sedgewick, Scott, Fonda, and
Dillonare in primo form here, along
with two other main actors whose
names I don’t remember, but they
are still good too. Kudos to y’all!
Also give a pat on the back to
Cameron Crowe, who brought his
own story of the Seattle singles
scené to the screen without getting
too bogged down in topicality -
this could be an universal story
going on in any other big city inthe
country besides Seattle.

Atsome points I found myself
wondering whether the film was
too trendy even for itself with its
grunge rock soundtrack and the
“Cooler than thou” attitude of the
cheracters, butconsidering that the
movie has been finished for over a
year and a half before the “Seattle
sound” broke out from the under-
ground, I am willing to forgive
Crowe. What I was concerned
about was why Warner Brothers
waited so long before releasing the
film - but I guess it doesn’t relly
matter because with the pack of
losers (for the most part) out right
now, it makes me appreciate this
gem all the more.

new cut.

It is the five remaining songs
on this 37-plus minute project that
provide the real meat of the album
(apart from “We Shall... .”). The
two minute, rollicking two-step-
per“Mr. Right (or Mr. RightNow)”
provides a woman with her choice
of a one night stand or a beau, and
provides, the listener with a dyna-
mite swing that has to produce a
grin. “Every Now and Then”, with
an accompaniment that conjures
up images of Brooks’ “The River”,
is one of the album’s strongest and
most moving tunes; a song about
remembering an old love, it could
make a good single.

“Learning to Live Again” co-
written by country’s top songwriter
Don Schlitz, is a wonderfully bit-
tersweet and somewhat humorous
song about trying to get back on
one’s feet after a break-up; and
“That Summer” provides a new
twist as far as subjects go. The
song, which tells the story of a
farmhand who becomes the lover
of his boss, a widower, is a truly
great momenton the album (among
many). It has a steady beat paced
by asoleacoustic guitar, and should
make a great single, reminiscentof

THE Crossword

songs by great storytellers from
Billy Joel to Bruce Springsteen.

The second cut on the album
wins my immediate nod as per-
sonal favorite, but I’m a sucker for
the emotional ones. As if the mes-
sage and production of “Some-
where Other Than the Night” are
not strong enough tocarry thesong,
Garth Brooks finds a vocal dy-
namic and a beauty he has never
before produced. The open-
throated style is not one he has
mastered - it is not‘his; but his
efforts on this song are worth his
weight in gold. He records a tri-
umph, and one of his very finest
songs ever.

The Chase is entertaining and
engaging; but beware, for it is not
entirely like the Garth Brooks you
have heard before. It is different,
butitis unquestionably Garth. Pur-
ists will perhaps call into question
the song choices; the style is dif-
ferent - not as “country.” True, it
does lack (noticeably) a beltbuster
(the type of song of which he is
truly the master) like “Friends in
LowPlaces”, “Rodeo”, or“Shame-
less”; but it manages to extend
itself in so many other directions
that such a song had no place on
this album. Yes, the album is a
departure; but, in their own ways,
so were the last two. Garth Brooks
has earned the right to explore, to

challenge himself and us with new
subjects and new sounds.

But Garth still possesses the
voice of country, and it is that
voice that brings it all together. He
makes any song country, and he
charges every song he sings with
life. With each album, Garth’s
songs are less radio-oriented and:
more directed toward creativity and
integrity.

And, in thatlighthe has scored
his greatest victory. Give the al-
bum some time; give it several
listenings. This may not.be your
favorite; it isn’t mine. I, too, am
hoping that he will return to his
country roots. But Garth has al-
ready shown us the performer and
the country super-superstar. The
Chase is his effort to show us - in
every sense of the word - the artist.

Garth Brooks is still Garth
Brooks; if you don’t believe me,
go see him in concert (if you can
get tickets). And if The Chase
leaves you yearning for more...
he’ll be back . . . and he’ll be back
on top (although we’ll see what
affect Taylor has on his style and
song choice). The reason no one
can seem to take his place? No one
can match his vitality, his energy,
his creativity, his talent, and his
passion. There is only one king of
country; accept no substitutes.
