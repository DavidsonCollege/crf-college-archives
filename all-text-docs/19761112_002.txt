...covington serves on first board

[Continued from page 1]

because of this, Covington
should serve as the first media
representative.

“He has many great ideas
and much experience,’’ Wat-

ford said.
Watford doubted if the Me-

dia Board would be in effect
before the coming elections in
December, but he did feel it
would be in operation soon
after the “ -st of the year.

He explained that the board
had many pressing responsi-
bilities including drawing up
standards for responsible jour-
nalism.

“It’s not going to be a
radical board breathing down
the necks of the editors,’’
Watford said. .

The Media Board that is
selected will only serve until
May 31. The normal term of
office will be from June 1
through May 31.

The proposed budget is sent
to each trustee before the
February meeting, and the
Finance and Management
Committee of the trustees
reviews the budget for final
presentation to the group.

“The Finance and Manage-
ment Committee may make
some changes, but the trus-
tees seldom do,” according to
the Self-Study Report.

Davidson College’s opera-
tional budget is split down
into three departments: edu-
cational and general, in which
are included all academic ex-
penditures and athletics; aux-
iliary enterprises, those expec-
ted to break even like dormi-
tories and the food service;
and financial aid for students.

Actual expenditure for
1975-76 was $7,796,953.94,
broken down into’ $5,509,
845.22 for educational and
general, $1,664,899.76 for
auxiliary enterprises, and
