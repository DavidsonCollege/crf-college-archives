Davidson takes pride in at

‘fordability despite costly tuition

Merit scholarships and financial aid packages keep school competitive

By Beth Bacon

Inlight of the recent announce-
ment of the John M. Belk Scholar-
ship and the U.S. News & World
Report ranking of best college buys
(Davidson ranked Sth in price and
‘12th in discounts), many students
wonder exactly what merit schol-
arships are available to Davidson
students and how many students
recieve them. Investigative re-
porter Beth Bacon probes ihe ad-
missions office to find out.

Davidson College prides _it-

self on being “affordable to the
best students despite the high tu-
ition,” says Dean of Admission
and Financial Aid Nancy Cable
Wells. This is the made possible
through such scholarships as the
Belk Scholarship, the Cornwell
Prize in Writing, the First Union
Gift in Education, the Will Terry
Prize for Leadership, and the Baker
Scholarship, to name a few.

In the last five years, 35 mil-
lion dollars have been raised in the
campaign for Davidson in order to

help keep the school affordable.
“Davidson must remain accessible
tothe best and the brightest regard-
less of their material resourses,”
writes President John Kuykendall
in the introductory letter of-a book
describing the scholarships.

“Adequate financial aid is es-
sential to make the class we want
to make,” says Cable Wells. Ap-
proximately 15 to 20 percent of
each freshman class—60 to 80 stu-
dents—receives some sort of merit
based scholarship.

There are 500 scholarships in
existence at Davidson. Two of
them, the Baker and Belk Scholar-
ships, pay for full tuition, room,
and board. The Will Terry Prize
for Leadership is a $15,000 schol-
arship which is awarded to two
freshmen.

The John Belk Scholarship is
in the process of being developed.
Itisa ‘good, non-need-based schol-
arship to draw the very best to a
class.” The scholarship will be

plays strong academic, athletic, and
leadership performances. This
endowed scholarship will make the
scholarship program at Davidson,
“hopefully one of the most distin-
guished ... in the southeast,” says
Cable Wells.

The Office of Admissions uses
a need-blind approach to admis-
sion. This means that the decision
of whether or not a student is ac-
cepted at Davidson does not de-
pend on whether or not they can
afford the tuition.

Accelerated Learning
Program provides
practical study skills

By Mary Laura Moretz

Procrastinating Davidson stu-
dents can no longer use the excuse,
“But I just can’t study.” The Ac-
celerated Learning Program aims
to make sure students of all disci-
plines know the best ways to uti-
lize their study time.

Assistant to the Vice-Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs Marcia
Beck organizes the different semi-
nars each semester. She says that
“it’s important that people know
this is not a remedial program. At
Davidson, people are professional
students, and like any profession-
als they need seminars on how to,
keep up.”

The program includes a few
workshops each semester, focus-
ing on specific study skills in dif-
ferent areas. Junior Lillian Mont-
gomery attended sessions about
studying math and sciences this
semester and says, “It’s really help-
ful just to review the skills for
studying different types of things.”

SGA voting
poll moved
to Commons

By Courtauld McBryde

A low student voter turnout
during various elections prompted
the SGA to change the current vot-
ing procedures. The voting station
located in the Union will be relo-
cated to Vail Commons.

Previously, students voted in
Chambers and in the Union from 9
a.m. until 5 p.m. Due to the low
voting percentage, SGA passed this
proposal in an effort to increase
student participation.

The SGA by-laws concerning
voting procedures will now read:
“Allelections of the SGA are to be
secret written ballot at the polling
place located in Chambers from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. and at the Vail Com-
mons during dining hours, which
are 7:30a.m. to 10a.m, and 11 a.m.
to 1:45 p.m. Elections occur on the
day specified, with run-offs held
on the following days.”

SGA President ~ Eric

Beck explains that the pro-
gram is “Davidson-specific,”
meaning that the techniques dis-
cussed are targeted directly toward
the Davidson community and
lifestyles. Davidson faculty, staff,
and students give all the presenta-
tions.

Patterson Court has begun to
co-sponsor the workshops as well.
Lexy DeVane of Warner Hall, who
helped coordinate a recent semi-
nar, says “it’s a good way for the
eating houses to get involved in the
academic side of student life.”

Beck says she would like to
see more students attend the work-
shops and hopes the topics for next
semester attract bigger crowds.
Workshop topics for the winter
and spring include improving writ-
ing skills, forming and using study
groups within the Honor Code,
stress relief, and memorization and
concentration.

Rosenbach explained that the Com-
mons poll should draw more stu-
dents to vote than the Union poll.
In the past, the Union polls drew
only small numbers of voters.
