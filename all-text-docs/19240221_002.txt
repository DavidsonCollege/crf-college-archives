Wildcat Grapplers Beat
V. P.I. In Close Fight

Lindamood’s Men Win Over Tech
Men 16-11 in Hard-Fought Match

Captain Poots Lindamood’s mat men won
a decisive victory over V. P. I. on last Sat-
urday night. They defeated the Gobblers
16-11 in their own back yard, the meet being
staged in Blacksburg. The Gobblers fought
hard and when the last match began the
score was tied at 11-11.

Former Captain Cromartie was the star of
the meet. Wrestling in two matches, the 125-
pound class and the 135-pound class, he won
both matches, defeating Elsea by the referee's
decision and winning from Rouzie, in the last
match of the meet, by forcing his shoulders
to the mat.

V. P. I. scored their points in the follow-
ing manner: Sanders was given a decision
over Cox in the 145-pound class; Flory, in
the 158-pound class, threw Patterson in one
of the fastest matches of the entire meet,

and Miles was given a decision over Harry
Vance in the 175-pound class.

The Wildcats won their points through
Selser’s fall over Andrews in the 115-pound
class; Cromartie’s win from Elsea on time;
Lindamood’s’ time decision over Lineber in
the heavyweight class, and Cromartie’s de-
feat of Rouzie in the 135-pound class. The
last named match was won in the last two
minutes of time.

Archie Keels Announces

Fifteen Game Schedule

Red and Black Diamond Artists to
Play Teams of Two Carolinas

Davidson students will have the opportun-
ity of seeing the Wildcat nine in action on
her new field in seven games during the ap-
proaching baseball season. The following
schedule, as arranged by Manager Archie
Keels, shows that Captain Boushee and his
Wildcats will have a difficult program on
the diamond this spring:

March 28—Oak Ridge at Davidson.

March 29—Oak Ridge at Davidson.

April 2—Lenoir at Davidson.

April 5—Elon at Davidson.

April 8—Trinity at Greensboro.

April 11—Wake Forest at Davidson.

April 12—Guilford at Davidson. ¥

April 14—N. C. State at Davidson.

April 17—Wake Forest at Wake Forest.

April 18—N. C. State at Raleigh.

April 21—Carolina at Gastonia.

April 29—Wofford at Rock Hill.

April 30—U. of S. C. at Columbia, S. C.

May 1—Furman at Greenville, S. C.

May 3—Trinity at Gastonia.

Out of a total of 15 games 7 will be played
on the Hill, and no doubt a large part of
the student body will see the two games at
Gastonia and the one at Rock Hill,

Already the pitchers are oiling up their
gloves and limbering up their arms in prep-
aration for the workout which will begin in
a few weeks. Prospects are fine for a suc-
cessful season.

RAWSON’S YEARLING QUINT

(Continued from page 1)

they defeated: the N. C. State Fresh by a
34 to 16 score. The Farmers were com-
pletely outclassed “in all departments of the
game and were forced to bow to the scrap-
ping Kittens. At the end of the first half
they were trailing 18 to 5. No stars could
be pointed out for A. & E., though Waters
and Gusham played good games. Sapp and
Anderson were the Davidson _ stars. Sapp
found the basket for 14 markers while An-
derson was credited with 10. points. The
Freshmen put up the best game of the trip
against State. Coach Harry Hartsell, in
speaking for the team, said that it was, in
his opinion, the best Fresh team he had
seen on that court this year.

Those making the trip were Hewlitt, cap-
tain, Anderson, Beall, forwards; Hudgins
and Fawcett, centers; Sapp, Simpson, Goody-
koontz and Wynn, guards.

The season closes when the Wildcat “Rats”
play the Mooresville High team on the
Mooresville court. The M. H. S. boys are
bloodthirsty after their 21 to 20 defeat and
the game should be well contested. The date
has not been definitely set.

Student Body Votes To |
Increase Athletic Fee

Vote to Increase Fee From Two and
a Half to Five Dollars Each Term

Thursday morning at a meeting of the
Athletic Association, on motion of L. D, EI-

dent body voted unanimously to increase the
athletic fee for the coming year from two
dollars and a half to five dollars, President
Faison said in presenting the matter, “The
catalogue has been saying one thing and we
have been doing another.” He explained how
the catalogue had said that the athletic fee
covered admission to all the games on the
Hill and how the Athletic Association had
been compelled to charge the students for
many of the special games. By increasing
the fee to five dollars, less than at many
colleges, the students will be relieved of hav-
ing to pay at cach attraction and the Ath-
letic Association will be put on a firmer
foundation. Before the motion can go into
effect it will have to be passed on by the
faculty.

ANNUAL GOES TO PRESS FULL
OF GOOD MATERIAL

The faculty has recently passed favorably
on the Senior class petition for the collection
of three dollars additional annual fee along
with the regular dues. This will, in the
future, assure the securing of the money
necessary for the annual and will guard
against the incurring of another debt such as
was left over by last year's Senior class.
This debt has finally been paid largely
through the faithful and untiring efforts of
Editor D. J. Chipman and Business Manager
O. K. Allison,

All of the material for this year’s annual
was sent to the press Monday with the ex-
ception of the basketball writeup, which will
follow in a few days.

Aggtegate: advertising contracted to date
is already more than was in last year’s an-
nual. This at least points to the fact that
this year’s Senior class will not leave a trail

the class of last year. A good annual, com-
pletely paid for, will be something of an
innovation at Davidson College.

THREE RURAL SERVICES
CONDUCTED BY STUDENTS

On account of bad weather last Sunday
only three of the six rural Sunday Schools
were attended by students. . These were
Shearer, Mill Chapel, and the Convict Camp.

At Shearer there were 24 present. Those
present were divided into three classes. Aft-
er Sunday School, Rev. F. A. Barnes
preached on the subject, Jesus Saw the Mul-
titudes. He showed the need of the world
for Christian men and women who are will-
ing to give their money and themselves that
the Gospel might be preached to the heathen.

At the Mill Chapel there were 30 present.
Mr. Jackson conducted the service. Classes
were taught by Mr. Jackson, Marion Mur-
ray, and Hodgkin.

At the Convict Camp the Preachers’ Quar-
tet conducted the service. They gave sev-
eral selections and then had a_ testimony
meeting.

South Carolina says that they might as

Also McConnell breaks into the limelight,
with 10 points against Lenofr and 6 against
S. Carolina.

Capt. Low Pockets hasn’t decided when
to trot out the tank stallions. Well, no use
getting stale. .

We notice that “Buck” Shaw is going to
coach N. C. State on football. We didn't
know Buck was such a stud.

Trinity's Southern excursion resulted in
four wins and four losses. They lost to
South Carolina, Alabama, Birmingham A. C.
and Mercer, and won from Statesville A. C.,
Davidson, Howard and one other we don't
remember. '

“Biddle” Field is lending valuable assist-

Basketball Tournament

Schedule. In Raleigh

Tourney to Decide Ranking of
Teams in North Carolina

Plans have been laid and executed for a
state basketball tournament to be held in
Raleigh, N. C., on March 7th and 8th. Teams
representing the various universities and
colleges have been invited to participate in
the tournament. The dates have been set
so far ahead to allow teams entering the
S. I. C. tournament in Atlanta to take part
in the contest.

Coach Monk Younger, has entered his
fighting Red and Black machine, and he ex-
pects them to show up well. The dates set
work a hardship on the Wildcats, for there
is an interval of almost two weeks between
the last game of their regular schedule and
the first game of the tournament.

It is understood that Mr. Knight, of the
Durham “Y,” will referee the games. Teams
that have already been asked and have al-
ready accepted the invitation to take part
are: Carolina, Davidson, N. C. State, Trin-
ity and Wake Forest.

SEVERAL ADDITIONAL MEN
PLEDGED BY FRATERNITIES

Several additional fraternity pledges have
been announced during the last week. Kappa
Alpha, in addition to her other pledges, will
initiate W. K. Johnson and K. N. Jones;
Kappa Sigma has initiated R. A. Mitchell;
M. L. Carrol has been pledged by Pi Kappa
Alpha.
