Welcome to the Small Time

DAVID SCOTT '92

This article is biased. All bear-
ing Opposing opinions shall lic
eviscerated before the sword of
my vengeful apathy. Dare ye en-
croach upon my petty pulpit?

] just wanted to say that I’m
jubilant, joyous in fact to the core
of cach and every organ and/or
locus of spiritual dynamism in my
body and, in short, darn pleased
with the progress of Davidson
football since my freshman ycar at
this fine institution. (I know all the
other teams are kicking butt as
well. Consider your praises sung,
but I'd have to write a book to do
you Justice.)

In the fall of 1987 I moved
from Atlanta, where all teams lose,
to Davidson where all teams lost.
Conditioned to failure I listlessly
intuited some morbid connection
between these populational and
intellectual centers of the New
South and mind boggling medioc-
rity in sporting pursuits. Cursed
with an illogical addiction to the
athletic pursuits of others, I rued
my fate.

Now a moment please. I feel I
must break for an explicatory inter-
lude. To those sports anti-fans out
there whose version of hell in-
volves a 12-pack and the Falcons
on the tube, I willingly confess to
the sin of impertincnce. My sub-
ject matter docsn’t matter. Sports,
the passionate pursuit of perspi-
rant men and women for, usually,
some sort of ball, score poorly on
the meaning meter. To this I re-
spond; I don’t matter, you don’t
matter, the world rates an ink
smudgc on the jean pockctof obliv-

ion, and we may as well blow the
sucker up and tidy up the void. In
short, if you stand on “meaning”
you tread on trembling ground.
On to football. When I was a
freshman, we stank. Southern
Conference teams laughed, spat,
and broke our spiritand spent Sat-
urday evening picking fur out of
theircleats. That’s no fun. Further-
more, I got the feeling that many
players were here for 1) Division I
football and 2) Division I football.
Davidson created a sortof football
welfare system for players who
couldn’t play Divison I anywhere
else. (Earnest apologics tocx-play-
ers now playing elsewhere and to
those who remained at Davidson
butcould have Icftto break wedges
at Oklahoma. Thanks for staying,
but I’ve got a point to make.)
Basically, we had no_ business

Last Saturday’s game

playing Division I, and finally the
trustees admitted it. Last Satur-
day’s game demonstrates how
much umes have changed.
Davidson played a wonderful
game Icaving spectators hoarse and
Emory and Henry wondering how
this onc gotaway. Fumblcd punts,
big points, long bombs, and a last
minute drive engineered by afresh-
man scnsation. Excuse the scn-
tence fragment, but that’s how
football is supposed to be played
even if the offensive linc doesn’t

influence the orbit of passing sat-

ellites. What a change from fresh- |

man year when the likes of Appa-
lachian State and Marshall used
Wildcats to keep the weeds down.
Davidson belongs in Division III
and has for twenty years. Now
football can be an institutional
hobby rather than an embarrass-
ment, but certainly not something
not to get excited about.

Finally, I'd like to compare
Davidson’s situation to that of the
University of Alabama who last
year made a coaching change and
has, like Davidson, experienced
much recent trauma with their foot-
ball program.

On Saturday Alabama lost to
Georgia onalate field goal. They’ re
(0-3. Last year they fired Bill Curry,
a good man anda good coach, after
committing the crime of going 10-
3 with an overachieving team and
bringing Alabama to the Sugar
Bowl for the first time in some ten
years. But he didn’t play for a
certain ex-coach, and he lost to
Auburn, so they canned him. Ala-
bama comes out looking like a
home for wayward rednecks pos-
sessing between them perhaps the
brains of a flattened pigskin, and
they’re still losing.

Davidson also has anew coach
(he of the last name everyone
wonders whether they should make
fun of) and a new attitude. Leave
the big time to the big boys. We’ll
have big fun down in our little
corner of the Picdmont and damn
the rest! |

turned junior history major and
co-editor of the opinions section.

Women at Davidson

Not Safe From Assaults

I’mnotsurc if I’ve given some
Davidson men too much credit or
not cnough. A number of them
have felt compelled to treat every-
thing I write as the Feminist Gos-
pel, capable of finding and de-
stroying the (perccived) tenuous
malc hold on supcriority.. lam not
rcferring to Mr. Crystal’s clever
response to my dangcrous mcs-
sage of live and Ict live, but to the
man who was so threatencd he felt
it necessary to phone me and in-
form my answering machine of his
intcnt upon finding me alone one
night walking home from the li-
brary.

To this man I have one re-
sponse: I do not walk anywhere
alone on this campus. My friends
and I travel in pairs or use the
escortservice. Asone ofthe found-
ers of Davidson’s Rape Aware-
ness Committee, I have read
enough literature and had enough
friends cry as they told me in sobs
of an attack to know better than to
put myself in such an easily avoid-
able risky situation.

Womenhere are obviously not
safe from assaults, verbal or physi-

cal. Last year, Lucia Kendall,
another writcr for The
Davidsonian, reccived phonccalls
similar to my own. These charm-
ing messages arc not reserved
exclusively for women who take
public stands on issucs, though. I
know two first ycar students who
were telephoned, with no apparent

provocation, and informed of
equally revolting and tcrrifying
potential occurrenccs.

Davidson is an idealized, not
ideal, place. Women are consis-
tently relegated to object status by
an extremely small, but psycho-
logically powerful, minority of

Davidson men. These “men’s
men” arcnotthe voiccof the school,
but they make the most frightening
noise.

Luckily, the resources here for
dealing with such an attack are
extensive. Davidson security,
Davidson town police, and the
Dean of Students Office are all
extremcly supportive. If a person
reccives any harassment, sexual or
violent, these agencies arc quick to
respond and know the proper proto-

-col to most efficicntly help the

victim.

Virtually every student, pro-
fessor, or administrator I spoke
with following my attack was out-
raged that such a base display of
violent tendencies could occur at
an institution of higher leaming as
prestigious as ourown. Most were
ready to go outand throttle the man
whocalled. Most were prepared to
lend me their rooms or homes to
escape into if the desire arose. All
were supportive, and I thank each
of them for their concern, but I
pray that such an overwhelming
display-of concern will never be
necessary again.

BOB cou.ins IN HEY

Hey Bob,

Where's My Car?

I wonder sometimes about
many a pressing issue. Things
like; Why am I here? What is the
meaning of life? What is Bob
Collins’s purpose in life? Why is
he here? Does he have to be?

Actually, it’s really a good
thing he is here, otherwise, who
would keep us from committing
such unpardonabicsinsas...parking
in an empty space!!!!

Does this sound familiar? You
come back from some tiring jour-
ney,and you spy anempty space in
the lot across from the Pi Kappa
Alpha house. You rush to get in,
and you head off to bed, blissfully
unaware that youreally parked ina
visitor’s space, and, while you are
sleeping, somctime in the dark and
dirty hours of the morn, just before
the birds begin their joyous song of
autumn, a Cushman Cop and his
evil henchman, the Towing Dude,
are greedily devouring your car
and later regurgitating it
in...Satellite parking!!!1 or even
worse; The Texaco station down

Where do these creatures of
the night get their powers, and why
are they so much more ruthless this
year than last? I cornered the
Towing Dude at the Texaco sta-
tion down the street. (his powers
are at an ebb in the daytime, you
see, sol wasn’t as afraid as usual
to go near him) He said that the
sinister force behind these hcart-
less towings is... Bob Collins.

The Towing Dude told a lot of
really neat stuff. He told me how
Bob Collins is the man behind it
all, and how he has allegedly au-
thorized the towers to do unspeak-
able things to our cars. I talked to
one girl whose car door was dam-
aged a good deal by an overzeal-
ous cop who didn’t really know
how to use aslim-jim, but went for
itanyway. ( Getting to tow acar is
pretty exciting stuff, you see.) She

spots, then tow them.
That is only fair.

wasn’t even parked illegally.

The Director of Facilitics Plan-
ning and the Physical Plant (I
wonder who that is?) had desig-
nated the -spot for a new strect
lamp, and rather than doing some-
thing really crazy like calling her
and asking her to move her car,
they decided the best thing to do
would be tow it. Is damaging our
cars at all really necessary? I per-
sonally saw these guys ‘tow a-car~
despite the fact that they couldn’t
get the stecring column unlocked.
I’m sure that did wonders for the
car. A fricnd of mine saw them lift
up the cnd of a car on the towing
hitchand shake it until the steering
unlocked. Oh, and I’m sure that
the owner’s manual of the car
says,” If you ever can’t getthe sicer-
ing to unlock, gct some help from
your local friendly Towing Dude,
or Bob Collins, if he’s around, lift
itupand shake vigorously until the
stcering unlocks.”

Another thing that bugs me is
that the school maps denote lots
for visitors, faculty and staff, stu-
dents, and even a frec lot. Whena
student parks in a faculty space, he
gets towed, no matter what the
hour. That is Bob’s law. Whena
faculty member parks in a student
space, ‘Ol Bobbo Icts them have
the space. Now, maybe I’m being
Silly, but if we get towed for park-
ing in their spaces, why don’t they
gettowed for parking in ours? They
