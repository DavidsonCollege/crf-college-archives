Duke Dean Speaks

About Preparation
For Law Students

Miller Urges People of Country
to Prepare Leaders for
Coming Years

DAVIDSON IS PRAISED

Advises Law Candidates to Take
Full Arts Course

Dean Justin Miller, of the Duke Law
School, spoke in chapel Wednesday,
taking as his subject, “Type of Selec-
tion and Training in Preparation for
Law.”

Dr. J. M. McConnell, dean of faculty,
introduced the speaker, saying that Mr.
Duke, endower of Duke College, had
asked for schools of ministry, teaching,
medicine and law and that an institu-
tion stressing each of these desires was
to be founded in the state. McConnell
said‘that Duke is one of the most out-
standing law schools in the country
and that much credit is due to Dean
Miller in having a hand in making the
law‘school what it is today. In intro‘
ducing the speaker, Dr. McConnell said
that Miller was not only one of the
best known law teachers in the South,
but he was for years known as one
of the most outstanding lawyers in the
country.

Dean Miller in his introductory re-
marks said that the law school at Duke
had much appreciation of Davidson
men.’ “The men from Davidson who
have come to Duke have done well,”
said Miller.

The high points in Dean Miller's talk
follow: “The people of the country
should think seriously about preparing
leaders for coming eyars. Leaders are
produced by a great crisis; on the
other hand, if we had great leaders we
would not ‘have crises.” Miller contin-
ued by saying, “What-does-aawyer
do? The general idea that prevails
among the common-frun of people is
that a lawyer spends his time before
juries and judges stating his case in a
dramatic manner,. This impression is
entirely wrong, a twentieth century
lawyer spends most of his time in His
own study with a law book before
him.”

“Law is a jealous mistress,” Miller
said. Men who choose law must give
all of their time to the study of this
vast subject. When one prepares him-
self for law he is prepared for almost
any other occupation. Better lawyers
can be obtained only by the men who
come from the various law schools

over the country receiving better
preparation.

Spending the latter part of his
speech advising the “students what

courses to take in their undergraduate
work, Dean Miller said that there is a
widely varied opinion on the courses
that a student should take, but that
his advice was to take a full arts course
as it is more generally needed.

Psychology 2 Class
Goes To Morganton

Dr. Hood Takes Class Through
State Insane Asylum

Members of Dr. Frazer Hood’s psy-
chology 2 class made a trip last Tues-
day, April 24, to Morganton, N. C., to

visit the State Insane Asylum located,

there.

Leaving Davidson at 9:30, the party,
led by Dr. Hood, began its tour of the
clinic about 1:30 in the afternoon, The
clinic is directed by Drs. Whitaker and
Long, the former in charge of the
men’s and the latter in charge of the
women’s ward, Several of the patients
at the clinic were used to illustrate
simple cases of mental diseases, the
symptoms—which included waxy flex-
ibility, negativism, and mutism—being
shown. Poetic, manic depression, and
cephallitic cases were illustrated, all of
the patients examined being classed
under the head of “dementia praecox.”

Dr. Long stated that over half of the
hospital beds now in use are devoted
to cases of insanity and that over one-
fourth of these cases are “dementia
praecox” cases, which are incurable.

After talks and explanations by Drs.
Long and Whitaker, the Davidson stu-
dents were allowed to visit the wards
and study casés of mental deficiency
at first hand.

Phi Beta Kappa To
Hear Dr. Voorhees

Speaker Is National Historian of
Fraternity

Oscar M. Voorhees? national his-
torian of Phi Beta Kappa, will give
a lecture Friday evening, May 4, at
7:30 o'clock to the Davidson Gamma
chapter and alumni from surrounding
His talk will be based on the
history of this national fraternity.

Voorhees will talk on the four or-
ganization periods. The Virginia pe-
riod deals with the establishment and
carly history of the first Phi Beta Kap-
pa fraternity at William and Mary in
1776. Under the second period, 1780-
1845, the New England universities
formed chapters. The next period was
characterized by large expansion. Be-
tween 1845 and 1883 chapters were es-
tablished throughout the country, and
the First National Council was organ-
ized,

From 1883 to the present time the
Phi Beta Kappa fraternity has organ-
ized stronger nationally and increased
the chapters to a total of 119. There
are about 70,000 members today.

Voorhees has been connected with
the National Council since its early
times. He served as national secre-
tary for a time and is now national
historian, He has compiled some new
material on the history of Phi Beta
Kappa and is now making lectures
throughout the South on this new
compilation of data and old history.

The Gamma Chapter of North Car-
olina, Davidson, which is sponsoring
this lecture, is composed of ten mem-
bers, They are: J. T. Blair, Odi Casali,

dent Lanier Pratt stated that as usual
the annual occasion will be in true
French style swith French food and
French surroundings. i

As members of the club arrive at
Dr. Watts’ hon, an allotted amount
of imaginative French money will be
given each customer to use as purchas-
ing power when he is admitted to the

pointed time.

Pan-Hellenic Council

To Consist of Seniors

One definite change in the organiza-
tion of the Pan-Hellenic Council was
made when the members passed a rul-
ing that in the future only seniors
could be representatives on the Coun-
cil.

This will cause no great change in
the representation of the Council, how-
ever, as in past years the majority of
its members have been seniors, al-
though until now there have been no
requirements for this.

No changes have yet been made in
the rushing program to be carried on
by the social fraternities for the com-
ing year, as it is above the authority
of the present Council to make any
such changes, and the new Council,
whose duty this will be, has not been
installed.

Swarthmore College, American
Secretary of the Rhodes Scholar-
ships, urging early announcement
of the 1934 competition for the
Rhodes Scholarships, says: ‘I
know by my own experience how
vitally important it is that those
students who expect to try in the
autumn for Rhodes Scholarships
should begin to make their plans
some time before the end of the
spring term of their present col-
lege year.”

Those seniors and juniors who
are interested are urged to secure
from Dr. G. R. Vowles copies of
the “Memorandum,” which gives a
summary of the conditions and ‘de-
tails of the competition. “‘Oxford
of Today,” by Crosby and Ayde-

mild or lacking of zest. People are
hung, eaten by ants, and shot. It por-
trays the oppression of peons and lays
bare the roots of fevolt. Wallace
Beery’s acting is excellent. Fay Wray

Davidsonian Gives
Banquet To Staff

,

Casali, Johnson Preside Jointly as
Toastmas ters

The Davidsonian staff entertained its
members at a banquet last Friday eve-
ning in the Chambers banquet hall.
This was the first time in the history
of the paper that such an entertain-
ment has been undertaken. Odi Casali,
retiring editor, and W. T. Johnson, re-
tiring business manager, served jointly
in the capacity of toastmaster.

The purpose of the banquet was not
only to reward the members for their
successful work during the past year,
but also to bring about closer har-
mony between the editorial and busi-
ness staffs of the paper. There were
several guests, outstanding in campus
publications, present. These included
Professor Fleagle, faculty adviser of
the Publications Board; Bill Fugate,
editor of the Yowl, and Ben Wyche,
newly-elected business manager of the
Yowl,

aging: editors were called on for im-
promptu speeches, Professor Fleagle

ning and he took occasion to compli-
ment the retiring officers of the David-
sonian for their outstanditfg work of
the past year. He also discussed the
possibilities of adding a course in jour-
nalism to the college curricula.

At the close of the banquet the de-
sire was unanimously expressed that
the occasion be made an annual event.

National Vocational
Conference To Meet

Leaders in Business Fields to As-
semble in Newark

A large representation of men and
women prominent in all fields of activ-
ity, will assemble in Newark, N. J.,
next June 26, 27 and 28 in the first
Choosing-a-Career Conference for col-
lege men and women. This will be oné
of the greatest galaxies of “Who's
Who” personalities ever assembled for
an educational cause.

Bankers, railroad presidents, famous
dress designers, noted journalists—lead-
ers of 31 different fields, will speak
cn the career opportunities in their re-
spective branches of American affairs.
This series will enable college men and
women who are in doubt about which
field to enter to obtain clearer, more
definite conceptions of.the leading in-
dustrics and professions, and to see
and hear leaders at a time when it is
most imperative—following the close
of the college season,

A further aim is to eliminate the
floundering of the student starting out
in business, University officials believe
that if the business brains of the coun-
try can open forum with those seek-
ing a carecr, many years of man-
power wasted in a misfit field can be
eliminated, It is hoped that the con-
ference, an entirely new experiment,
will stimulate young men and women
to think beyond merely getting a job.

Among the speakers will be Leonor
I’, Loree, president of the Delaware
and Hudson Railroad, who will speak
on railroads; Percy Strauss, president
of Macy’s, who will speak on retail-
ing; “Roxy,” who will speak on the
entertainment field; Roy Chapman,
acting manager of the Museum of Nat-
ural History, who will tell of explor-
iug as a career, and many others, in-
cluding Amelia Earhart, Elizabeth
