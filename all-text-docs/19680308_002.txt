McLuhan’s Day

Marshall McLuhan made famous a
couple of years ago a phrase which has
since come to be distorted in its popu-
lar use. The phrase, “The medium is
the message,” and, loosely defined, it
meant that the method of communica-
tion is a very significant part of what
is communicated.

McLuhan’s phrase is a useful way to
approach an analysis of this week's
election of the first president of the
newly-constituted Student Govern-
ment Association. If there was any
significance to the elections other
than as a test of political machines, it
was that the students who turned out
to vote for Joe Murphy wanted a new
medium of communication. ,

Because no election is ever settled
on the basis of issues, it cannot be
said that this desire for a new way of
communicating was a factor in the
minds of all voters. It was the only
issue at stake, however. .

Student politics, as well as faculty
and administration-trustee politics, at
Davidson have been marked for the
last several years by a quiet, behind-
the-scenes, individualized approach.
Dirty wash is not waved in the open.
Issues are raised and agreements be-
tween college factions reached in kid-
glove conversations initiated by in-
dividuals. New ideas are couched in
terms that offend almost no one. The
approach was comparable to carefully
chipping away barnacles to get at
sunken treasure. A more explosive
approach has been avoided because of
the fear it might blow up the treasure
as well as the barnacles.

How successful has it been? Like

any method, its success has depended
on the abilities and energy of those
using it. During the past two years,
it produced a long-overdue curriculum
and calendar revision, incorporating
a couple of imaginative and excellent
major concepts. It now appears to be
on the verge of bringing about a new
attitude towards the ways in which
the college should guide the develop-
ment of maturity in conduct.

These successes do not, however,
mean that the proven approach is
necessarily the only nor the best ap-
proach. In a given set of circum-
stances, it probably is the best. Joe
Murphy’s supporters apparently felt
that the old method had either not
proven itself or that the situation now
favors his less than subtle, give-’em-
hell - and - don’t - take - any - bull-for-
an-answer approach.

In either case, the question was one
of approach. Joe Murphy’s specific
proposals differ little from those of
his run-off opponent and the current
student government administration.
At. stake was the concern about
how one should go about accomplish-
ing those goals.

Murphy’s election puts student gov-
ernment on a mountain ledge, from
which it can scale new heights or fall
into the valley of disrepute. The Mur-
phy approach has succeeded greatly
outside of the South at colleges and
universities where its advocates were
perceptive enough to realize that they
had to have more than just an ap-
proach to offer. By the same reason-
ing, the Murphy approach will fail
dismally if it offers nothing more than
distorted McLuhanesque vibrations.

A Blue Sky Code

Preambles traditionally rank along -

side editorials as primary depositories
for empty tripe. But there are excep-
tions.

One is the draft preamble to the
report of the Committee on Rules and
Punishments. Except for the fact that.
it is written with all of the literary
beauty and grace of a Japanese radio
instruction booklet, the preamble is a
fitting beginning for the revision of
rules and regulations governing stu-
dent conduct.

A new philosophy about the role of
conduct regulations is set forth in the
preamble, a philosophy that employs
some of the assumptions and advan-
tages of the Blue Sky curriculum.

It recognizes the absurdity of trying
to develop an individual capable of
making mature decisions by depriving
him of the opportunity to make such
decisions. Individual responsibility is
seen as a part of the learning process.

One assumption inherent in the pre-
amble is that students have already
developed some degrees of maturity
by the time they enter Davidson. The
same assumption was made by the
Board of Trustees when they approved
the Blue Sky curriculum, and it is
justified if even half of the praise
meted out to each new freshman class
can be believed.

But the philosophy of the pre-
amble does not assume that the col-
lege should therefore have no concern
for the way in which a member of the
college community decides to carry
out his daily activities.

Indeed, the whole basis for the
preamble’s philosophy would seem to
be that Davidson has not been taking
seriously enough this concern. Rules

have taken the place of thought in the
college’s attitude towards the role it
should play in helping the members of
its community lead responsible lives.

{t would be hard to make a case
that graduates of .Davidson College
are seriously lacking in the ability to
make mature decisions. However, as
Dr. John Kelton, psychology professor,
noted a month ago, it is likely that
these alumni would have been at least
as prepared to make such decisions
regardless of the college they attend-
ed. The credit for this ability goes to
the raw material received by the col-
lege rather than to what the college
did to that material.

No reason exists, however, for the
college to be satisfied with turning
out graduates who have only picked
some traits of maturity by chance en-
counter. The college should be inter-
ested in fostering this development
instead of restricting it by the use of
closely defined limits on the conduct
of community's members.

There is no reason for a man to
leave Davidson no more prepared to
accept responsibility for his actions
than he was when he entered the col-
lege. The responsibility given to stu-
dents along this line now consists of
the option to obey or not obey the
college’s rules. With regard to the
drinking rule at least, the most com-
mon decision is to break it. Civil dis-
obedience is one thing; breaking a
rule on the sly is another.

The CRAP report is off to a good
start in its preamble. It is now a
matter of waiting a couple of weeks
to see whether the rest of the code of
responsibility lives up to its begin-
ning.

A Doubting Nation

Perhaps the most shocking thing
about the entire U.S.S. Pueblo episode
was not the audacity of the North
Koreans in seizing the American ship
and its crew.

Nor was it the course of inaction
taken by the United States after it
had lost its first ship at sea since Civil
War days.

Nor was it the total lack of defense
for the American vessel when it went
cru‘sing in known dangerous waters.

The most shocking thing of all had
to be the reaction of the American
people .. . a3 typified right here in
Fart Atkinson.

Up and down our Main Street the
tremendous “credibility gap” that had
spread out of the White House in re-
cent years had left the people in doubt
... wondering which side actually was
telling the truth ... wondering
whether the vessel was in international
seas when captured or not.

They remembered the false reports
that came out of Washington after the
“spy plane” was shot down over Rus-
sia. They remembered the false re-

ports issued by the White House con-
cerning the missile situation in Cuba.

And they recalled other attemots
by the administration in Washington
to cover up the truth.

They remembered those things and
wondered. They were a bit hesitant
about coming to verbal defense of this
nation in this newest crisis because
they could not be sure that they had
been fed the right facts.

They were as pro-American as anv
citizens ever were, yet they did not
want to get caught off base again with
comments or opinions that might
prove to be rather silly in the light of
the truth.

Isn’t that the real shocking thing
about the U.S.S. Pueblo? Isn’t the
greatest tragedy the fact that Ameri-
cans now cannot trust their leader-
ship?

It’s time to close that “credibility
gap” forever ... and for the White
House to quit dishing out only what it
wants the American public to hear.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

McMillin Finishes Attack
On Lack Of Responsibility

(Continued From Last Week)

Yes, dear reader, I am
sure you are excusing your-
self at this moment by say
ing. “Why should I take the
blame? I never ‘tampered
with a fire extinguisher.”
Then, 1 ask you, who should
be to blame? You should.
You have done nothing to
prevent its happening in the
first place.

Surely you are familiar
with the statement that ‘‘free-
dom entails responsibility."
It seems that you feel it is
your right to take unlimited
freedom unto yourself while
delegating all the responsi-
bility to someone else. You
want the freedom to destroy
the fire protection devices
for your pleasure, but you
want the college to be re-
sponsible for your safety.

You want the freedom to
take your tests when you see
it for your convenience, but
you want the college to leave
its time open to administer
them.

You want the freedom to
drink whenever 4nd wherever
you please for your socializ
ing. but you want the college
to be responsible for main
taining law and order.

You want the freedom to
choose not to fight in a war
to protect your personal con-
science, but you want the

fron Mountain Report:

Fake But Still Disturbing

“The Report From tron
Mountain,” edited by Leon-
ard C. Lewin, Dial Press.
I was talking to Bill Smyth

a few weeks ago and he ask-
ed me if I had heard of this
book, “The Report From Ir-
on Mountain."

He said someone, I think
Westray Battle, had shown it
to him over Christmas be-
cause he was alarmed about
what it had in it.

Well, I thought that it was
some sort of shady pornogra-
phy that was distributed on
an alley to alley basis up in
Battleboro somewhere and
that made me forget for a
while.

But I have come across it
frequently lately and from all
the evidence I can gather, I
will come across it much

“more frequently in the fu-

ture.

Leonard C. Lewin brought
the book to light last sum
mer. He said that he had got
ten it from an old acquaint
ance who had just served on
a government-sponsored but-
not-recognized Special Study
Group which was given the
job of making a complete.

It was, according to Lew-
in, anticipated that, in the
event of a world peace, there
would be many unforeseen
problems encountered by na-
tions unprepared for such a
state of affairs, and this
group was organized to give
the government some idea of
what to expect.

There is a lot of folderol
about some secret mountain
and secret meetings and the
anooymity that one would ex-
pgct from such a group.

‘Fortune’ magazine's Jan-
uary issue carries a pretty
good refutation of this part of
the book and most people say
that it is not really a com-
mission report but a satire
written by some person high

less probable.

No matter who wrote it or
where it came from, it is
published and being distrib-
uted. And it is very convinc-
ing. I shall quote three sen-

pouring down, but, according’

to a survey I have made on

more than one occasion, -
nat one in 10 of you bothers

to close the door when you

enter the building.

Did no one ever teach you
such a simple responsibility
as closing a door after you, or
do you feel that you simply
shouldn't have to be bothered
with such things?

You want more and more
freedom when you can't han-
dle the freedoms you have,
because you refuse to be re-
sponsible for making those
freedoms work. If you want
protection in-case of fire. then—— school.
you will have to learn to say
to your hall mate, “Put that
fire extinguisher back on the
wall. You are endangering
my safety."

You must learn to say to
your fraternity brother,
“you're drunk; go home and
go to bed. You are endang
ering my freedom to drink."

When you learn to conduct
yourselves as Davidson men
as well as Davidson gentile
men (which you haven't ac
complished yet), maybe you
will have earned the right to
more freedom.

“It is an incorrect assump-
tion that war, as an institu-
tion, is subordinate to the so-
ciety which it serves.”

“Without it (war) no gov-
ernment has been able to ob-
tain acquiescence in its ‘legit-
imacy’ or right to rule its so-
ciety."

“In general, the war sys-
tem provides the basic mo-
tivation for primary social
organization."

The whole book is a thor-
ough examination of the
problem and its conclusion is
that, given the state of af-
fairs that reigns today, world
peace is neither possible nor
desirable and before the
world is ready to support
peace, there will have to be
some very -basic changes in
human endeavors.

One time this boy gave me
a book and said that it would
change my life so be careful
when you read it. Well, it was
the dullest thing I had ever
seen since Kant but I will
take the same chance he
did: it will change your life.

The Myth of Frustrated Leadership

One of the most often repeated and most believed
concepts of the Davidson student body is that it by
nature is a mass of frustrated leadership. Since nearly
everyone was Mr. Something in his high school days,
reasoning goes, nearly everyone must still have a good
bit of his former leadership ability and willingness,
but most have to remain a part of the crowd because
there are just not enough leadership positions in

A very few boys, when they get to Davidson,
quickly establish themselves as chiefs; the rest of us
are Indians either because the competition is too stiff,
or because after a hard four year stint in high school
we decide that we'd rather sit this one out. But after
one or two years of sitting it out, most of us get pretty
bored and we get the idea that just maybe there is
somewhere on campus where we can use all that talent
and leadership our high school annuals said we have.
Some say that this ‘search for usefulness” is the even-
tual redlization of the upperclassman of the waste of
doing nothing at college. Maybe, but I think it’s more
of a simple reaction to two or three of the most boring
years anyone could ever spend anywhere.

But what are we late bloomers supposed to .do
when we finally decide that a little action—not too
much—might be good for us? Well, supposedly we’re
doomed to futility and frustration because all the
campus offices and jobs have already been filled.

Maybe that was true at one time, but at Davidson
today there are almost too many committees, programs,
projects and clubs for the student body to run them
all. There are certainly too many for us to know what’s
going on in half of them- -or for us to care. The point
is, though, that they are there and if we want them we
can have them, and if we don’t want them we can make
our own.

A good example of this is the STEP program,
which was non-existent until a professor and a few
upper-class students decided it was needed as a means
for the college to help the town, in some ways. Or, on
a different level, the Blow-Up '68 program, started this
year, again by' upperclassmen, to bring the fraternity
more into college life as a whole.

The thing that stops most people before they
begin to start any sort of project is the idea that it
would just be too hard to carry out, even though they
may have the interest and the time. Money and ex- |
perience seem to be the two main barriers to getting
beyond the idea stage.

Money and experience are two things, however,
that we are starting to have a good deal of now at Da-
vidson. For almost any interest or idea a student might
have there is a faculty member who shares the interest
and who would be willing to advise. And with the es-
tablishment. of a fund through the student union to
finance student projects, any worthwhile program can
at least make a start without having to worry too much
about money.

Already in the past two or three years a number
of programs have developed, not prompted by the
administration, but by the students alone, and there
are plans for more next year. So perhaps in a year or
two, if not now, the myth of frustrated leadership at
Davidson will be as dead as the student body once was.

Student Blue Sky Group Needed

Having attended the National Stu-
dent Association Conference on Edu-
cation reform, we feel that Davidson
student government needs to do some
serious thinking and acting in the
area of its role in the life of the col-
lege, and in particular of the students
it says it represents and serves.

We have found the Davidson stu.
dent government unimaginative in
its actions, and in its aims: it is
badly in need of creativity.

We have also noted a general un-
willingness of the student government
to undertake to solve the problems it
obviously faces.

Although it has done more than in
the past, a union rug and new soft-

drink machines are a sorry show, es-
pecially when one thinks of the poss!-
bilities.

In the same manner that the faculty
embarked on the Blue Sky program.
we feel that the student government
should move into a thorough examina-
tion of its role and influence. With a
new constitution, we need to explore
the possibilities under it.

Although students may lack the ex
perience which faculty members have
usually gained through age and back.
ground, it is an invaluable experience
for those engaged in “liberal educa-
tion’ to participate in the shaping of
that education, Mistakes may be toler-
ated when in the long run they are for
the good.

Therefore, we recommend that a
special committee be established to
examine the role and influence of
student government at Davidson Col-
lege, and that this committee concen-
frate especially on ways the student
government can be of benefit to the
students, both in thelr education and
in thelr general welfare.

Recommendations which cen-
tered around proposing @ student
Blue Sky committee were pre-
sented fo the Student Council
this morning by the councli’s
delegates to the National Stu.
dent Association Conference on
Educational Reform in Atlante,
Ga., Feb. 22.25,

This is the text of the report,
which was presented by freshmen
Harrison Higgins and Steve Eng-
strom and sophomore Franklin
Anderson.

The scope of this committee should
be without limit, and the committee
should include the most creative stu-
dents on campus as well as the usual
political appointees which any com-
mittee receives.

The committee should be allowed a
budget that would allow it to consult
other schools and to carry out exten-
sive research into the feasibility and
advisibility of various innovations at
Davidson.

In particular we wish the committee
to consider the following proposals,
both for their intrinsic value and for
their ability to lead on to further
ideas: ,

— The student government budget
should be increased to about $10,000,
a figure commensurate with the role
the student government could play
in the life of the students. This could
be accomplished with a $9.00 per year
increase In the activities fee.

— An experimental college should be
established in order to allow students
to take courses not offered in the regu-
lar curriculum, to allow students to
share their knowledge of special areas

with others, and to keep the faculty
aware of student needs and talents in
the curriculum.

— The student government should
seek an endowment, or sources of in.
come separate from the college, for
use in its projects, with perhaps a paid
employee to raise funds. It is reason.
able to expect that foundations might
be willing to supply funds for imagina.
tive, creative, and experimental stu-
dent programs.

— The committee should check into
the possibility of incorporating the
SGA under non-profit corporate
status.

— A fund of about $1,500 should be
established for the purpose of bailing
students out of jail, and for defending
Students against unfair judicial action
by the college, should the occasion
ever arise to appeal a case to federal
court.

The major goals of this fund would be
to keep a student in school getting his
education -which is, after all, the
purpose of the college—and to make
the administration more careful to
observe a student's constitutional rights
to substantive and procedural due pro-
cess.

~— A radio station should be establish.
ed under the jurisdiction of the publi-
cations board. It. should be commercial.
but still cater to student needs.

- The possibility of establishing a
North Carolina federation of student
governments to serve the various col
leges should be investigated. Such a
federation would have substantial ad.
vantages in obtaining speakers and
concert groups.

— The student government should
examine its religious commitment,
asking if it is fulfilling it. and the role
of the YMCA, asking how the YMCA

contributes to the commitment.

— tf Davidson is really a Christian
school, and bans discrimination by
student organizations on the basis
of race or creed, why should the fac.
ulty continue to remain both racial-
ly and religiously segregated?

— The student planning program for
high school students, and student ef-
forts at recruiting should be revised
with the specific aim of obtaining more
Negro students, ‘both to end the token °
integration now present and to widen
the scope of the student body.

— Orientation should be an introduc-
tion to a liberal arts education and
NOT an indoctrination into adminis.
tration policy. Steps should be taken to
correct this situation before Septem-
ber, especially considering the already
extensive student influence (if not con-
trol) in orientation.

— The student government should
establish its own lectureships like the
Otts and Reynolds lectureships, more
exfensive than the Great Issues Pro.
gram, and should have a significant
voice in committees for the Otts and
Reynolds lectureships:

— The students should have equal
membership on all faculty committees.
but most important of all. those deal-
ing with faculty tenure and recruiting.
After all, it's our education.

— Somebody should do some serious
thinking on the theory of student legal
rights, and compile federa] decisions
in this area, to fill in .@ vast abense
of knowledge. (For instance. the court
decision establishing in loco parentis
was made by only a low-level state
court in Florida in the 1910's.)

Such information should be published
in the “Wildcat Handbook,” and stu-
dents should be thoroughly briefed on
their federal rights.
