ALUMNI N-

Davidson Alumnus Has
Been Elected President

ot Presb

Rev. John McSween, 08, Has
Already Started His Duties

HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE

He Has Accepted This Post, Rec-
ognizing a Monumental Task
Ahead—Humbleness is
Characteristic

Davidson College alumni have long
been renowned as leaders in educa-
tion, but in the past decade consider-
able reflection has been cast upon this
institution by the election of several
of its alumni to posts of prime impor-
tance—to the leadership of colleges,
universities and seminaries.

The latest addition to Davidson's
“hallof fame” in the educational world
is Rev, John McSween, ‘08, former pas-
tor of the Central Presbyterian Church
of Anderson, S. C., who has been elect-
ed as president of the Presbyterian
College of South Carolina. He has ac-
cepted this post and has started duties
incident to his new position,

Shortly after his election and ac-
ceptance, a full-page feature article was
devoted to the new president of P. C.,
extracts of which follow:

“The Rev. Mr. McSween finished
Davidson in the class of 1908, receiving
his B. S. degree, Upon his graduation,
he returned to Timmonsville and was
associated with his father in the mer-
cantile business for a period of two
years.

“He soon, however, heard the call
of the ministry, an urge which he felt
early in life. He attended Columbia
Theological Seminary in 913, and later
did special work at the University’ of
South, Carolina. An ardent lover of
athletics i‘nall of its forms, Mr. Mc-
Sween took part in several sports, but
was outstanding in baseball.

“After finishing his work at the Uni-
versity of South Carolina, he did post-
graduate work at a biblical seminary in
New York. His first ministerial as-
signment was in western North Caro-
lina in connection with the Lees-Mc-
Rag. Institute for Boys, and in addi-
tion to this work, served nine or ten
mountain churches as pastor.

“He later accepted a call to the
Presbyterian Church at Dillon, where
he served until 1916, when he was
called as chaplain of the United States
army and was sent to the Mexican
border, Upon his return and the out-
break of the World War and America’s
entry into it,
overseas,

he enlisted for service

He served in France for a
period of 22 months, returning in April,
1919, * * *

“Immediately following his  dis-
charge, Mr. McSween took up duties
as pastor of the Presbyterian Church
at Rowland, N. C., where he served
until he became pastor of the Presby-

_terian Church at Clemson College, is}
C. He remained there from 1923 until
1925, the year he came to Anderson as
pastor of the Central
Church.”

The feature article gave in full Mr.
McSween’s letter of acceptance. Per-
haps no better criterion to the true
character of the new Presbyterian
College pastor could be obtained than
by reading his letter to the board of
trustees. In it, re recognized the
monumental task ahead, pledged his
wholehearted efforts to the institution,
and throughout there was a prominent
strain of humility.

A personal, intimate insight can be
gained from the following tribute ap-
pearing in the article:

« ‘Parson’ John, as he is affection-
ately known to his very intimate
friends, and they are legion, is a man
of many attainments, including the
ability to ‘talk with crowds and
keep his virtue, or walk with kings
and not lose the common touch,’ He
has the ability to ‘know’ people. Al-
thogh he) meets hundreds he has never

in all of his endeavors. He is full of
thusiasm ‘for an enterprise if he be-
lieves init, but he possesses the cour-
