partment last June, an honor toward |
which every school in which there is a|
| military unit works. It was a signal dis-
tinction to the local organization, but
immediately the question arose in many
ininds if it were the proper thing to. have
a military unit at Davidson.

Several editorials were written during
the- summer months, notably those ap-
peaing The Camp McClelland Messenger,
published at Anniston, Ala., which is
cdited by Capt. John W. Wilkins, one |
of the officers stationed at Davidson Col-
lege. Under the. caption, “Military
Training and Religion,” Capt. Elkins cites
Davidson particularly and defends the
presence of this work in the Presbyterian
institution. His editorial along that line
is as follows:

“The individuals—sometimes known as
rabid pacifists—who would do away with
military training in our colleges and
schools, and thereby make this country
defenseless in another national emer-
gency, frequently hide behind the skirts
of the Church in setting forth their
theories. One of their strongest argu-
ments against military training appears
to be that it is irreligious and should be
condemned on this score.

“In this conection the awarding of dis-
tinguished college rating to Davidson
College by the war department is inter-
esting. The Presbyterian Church con-
trols the college and it is from this in-
stitution that a great many ministers of
that denomination come. Since the
founding of the school in 1837 over 750
of its graduates have entered the min-
istry. The whole atmosphere about the
college contains a religious element and
one of the largest clubs is known as the
Ministerial Band.

are put out and pick out one.

JUNIOR MINSTREL

The Junior class is planning to pull off
a big stunt to pep up _the boys on the
night before they go onan extended
tour of two weeks to eat Christmas tur-|
key. The class is very well stocked with
a number of comical characters, some of |
whom will endeavor to display their |
talent in a negro minstrel. |

Bud Guthery, a most talented fellow
of that class, plays; the role of manager,
while under him Mutt Stigler and Bobby |
Glenn will feature the foot-lights of the
affair, Another one of the outstanding
members of this minstrel is Jim McAI-
ister, who acquitted himself most cred-
ibly in the Junior stunt. Ed Wilson will |
also be an added attraction for the event.

From the display that the Junior class
made’in their play on Stunt Night, they
will probably be good.

They have several plans that they have |
not made public yet for securing the|
money to offset the expense of Junior}

‘Davidson Golfers
Down Statesville

The Davidson golfers journeyed to States-
ville last Saturday, November 20, for a
match, with a club of that city, which they
won by the decisive score of 13 to 5. The |

|

team making the trip from Davidson was |

| composed of the following men, who played |

in the order mentioned: Steve McGill, Bill |
| Wolfe, Ben Wilson, Boyce Martin, and Ar-|
thur Mills. |

The match was begun with the playing of | |
two foursomes. McGill and Wolfe, playing |
| first, won from DeArmond and Wagner, of |
| Statesville, six to five. Wilson and Martin |
won from Gillam and Harris by a very close |
| score. |

The method used in determining the score!
of each team was that the winning team of |
each nine holes was to receive one point and
also the winner of the entire eighteen holes, |
This gave each team an equal basis and sim- |
| plified the matters of keeping the score.

McGill won from DeArmond five and |
four; Wolfe defeated Wagner five to four;
Wil
and won the second and the match; Martin

lost to Harris three and two; while Mills
tied his match, losing his first and winning
the second from Cooper.

After bad weather the early part of the
week, the condition of the Statesville course
was not at its best, which was responsible
for the poor scores made by the players. The
Davidson boys stated that they were used to
that from their early practicings.

A return match will be played on the Da-
vidson course in about two weeks. It is not
yet known whether the date, December 4th,
will suit both teams.
