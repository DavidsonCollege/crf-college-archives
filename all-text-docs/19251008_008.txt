It was a game of: games. It was a great
battle because both teams were fighting every
minute. Both teams were playing heads-up
football. Both teams wanted a victory. Both
teams knew that a student body was behind
them, the Wildcats on the field, and the
Wake Forest students back on their own
grounds receiving the fracas play by play.

As for the Wildcats, they clawed and they
scratched, they snarled and they whooped,
they pushed and they plunged, they snagged
passes and kicked balls, they ran and they
stumbled, they clipped and they interfered;
in fact, they did everything that went toward
giving them a 7 to 7 tie, and though they
came from the field with drooping shoulders,
tired bodies and many bruises, behind it all
was an inner feeling of elation, for they
knew, as well as did every spectator, that
they had given their all;-and in so doing had

showered down honor and glory upon their

“Little Lucian Wells,” as several of the
papers called him after the game Saturday,
was the feature of the contest, and while
eleven Davidson players were stars, he per-'
the others, in his terrific
drives, his smashing end runs, and his deadly
tackles. Thrill after thrill followed his great
playing.

The combination, Grey and Hendrix,
brought tears to the eyes of Wake Forest !
supporters, and balm to the hearts of Wild-
cat supporters. Thrice they completed
passes; many times Grey carried the ball;
and throughout the game his toe kept the

Demon Deacons from lurking in Wildeat.
territory. It was Hendrix that. piloted the
team better than he has ever played, and to
his ability to:mix the plays, bewildering the
Baptists, is due a great deal of credit for
| ticing the tilt.

Black proved a pile driver. Time and
again he was called on to hit that mass of
flesh presented by Wake Forest, and aided |
by seven fighting men on the line he often-
times squirmed through for good gains. ony)
once or twice was he thrown for losses, and
for that matter is was seldom. that any play- |
er did not go beyond the line of scrimmage. |

Wake Forest played a great game of foot- |
ball, fighting every second of the game. The |
temperature of the afternoon was more in- |
clined to warrant baseball, and because of |
the size of the players they perhaps wilted |
| quicker. But even.then, they kept the Wild- |
cats busy, the men in the backfield being four |
lof the best backs that can be called together |
on any one team,

Then there was Riley in the line, which |
did more toward keeping down the. Wildcat |
score than any other man. On every punt he |
| was down the field in a jiffy, nailing the re- |
iccivers for short gains. ' It was also Riley |
who blocked the placement kick. |
| Wake Forest scored in the first five min- |
| utes of play. Only six plays were necessary
| for the counter, Greason skimming end for
| 25 yards and the touchdown, with Ellerbe
| kicking goal,
| Many hearts sank as the rapid march of
| the Wake Forest eleven was recorded, and
many though the prediction of a 21-point
| margin would be a reality. But undaunted
| by the terrific onslaught of the Baptists, the
| Scotchmen tightened, and from then on they
| had the upper hand.

In that intial quarter Davidson came
| within striking distance of the goal, but the
| brawn of the Baptists made them miss a first
ilo by one yard, the ball going over to

Wake Forest on their own 11-yard line. It
was like taking a touchdown away from
| Davidson,
| In the second quarter Davidson almost
| scored a safety. Laird kicked, and Backley,
| playing safety, received. The ball was on
| the four-yard line, under the goal posts, -with
Pinkney making an_ attempt to grab it.
Rackley, however, wanting to get out from
under the goal posts, picked up the ball,
circled the goal posts, and when finally
downed the ball was but a few yards in play-
ing territory. Arrowood had narrowly miss-
ed throwing him behind the goal lines, his
tackle being low and only slowing up Rack-
ley.

Garrity sent his fighting Demons back in
the third quarter, evidently determined to
trample the little Davidsonian team. But
after three first downs the tide changed, and
then Davidson began a march that finally
gave her a touchdown, Wells, the star of
the day, going across on a criss-cross play.
Laird tied the fray.

Once more Mank Younger’s team was
tripping down the field, but the ball was
lost when a placement kick was attempted
from the 48-yard line, Wake Forest block-

haps outshone

the Wildcats, for it was Wake Forests’ ball
on Davidson‘s 35-yard line, but Hendrix in-
tercepted a pass and the game soon ended.

| PLAY-BY-PLAY

(Continued from page 7)
Wells, like

through the air, made a beautiful tackle,

pace, darting an arrow

hitting him with such impact that Rack-
ley was carried back through the air for
five yards. Sykes failed to gain, and af-
|ter a pass, Rackley to Ober, was ground-
ed, Black intercepted one on his own 45-
yard line,

Black gained five, Grey failed, and for
the third time the combination, Grey and
Hendrix, completed a pass for 18 yards
and first down. Failure to gain on two
plays and an incomplete pass, Grey at-
tempted a placement kick from the 35-
yard line, said kick being blocked by

Wake Forest and recovered by the De- |
mon Deacon’s on -Davidson’s 32-yard line. |

The Baptists gained nine yards in three
plays, and then Hendrix intercepted a
pass on his own 18-yard line. Leggette
gained three. Black garnered two, and
at this point the referee’s whistle ended
the game, the ball in Davidson’s posses-
sion, on her 25-yard line, third down and
five to go. Final score: Wake Forest 7;
Davidson 7.

Wouldn't it be great to be state champions.
Fight ’em, Wildcats; fight ’em; and if the
undaunted spirit of the game last Saturday

continues, it will be hard to hold the sturdy |

little Presbyterians this season. It would be
great to go through without a single defeat,
but then there is P. C., and Furman ahead.
All in all, we know that we are going to
have some good games.
