Habitat still going strong

By Brooke BAGWELL

The Habitat for Humanity
project is progressing successfully
according to the group’s chief or-
ganizers. Since last week’s rally
the grand total of money raised has
risen to $19,181.96.

The house is scheduled to
break ground in January, and Co-
ordinator of Community Service
Catherine Turner expressed the
group’s desire to raise $20,000 by
Christmas. Habitat hoped to bring
in money through its involvement

in Sunday’s Alternative Gift Dair
and Christmas Vespers: service.
Proceeds from the Habitat booth at
the gift fair and the vespers offer-
ing will go toward fundraising ef-
forts.

Amy Hawfield, Chair of the
Fundraising Committee, expressed
her personal enthusiasm with
Habitat’s progress and noted that
“people are getting excited about
the project.” Indeed, the college
and community have responded
positively with approval and sup-
port.

Individual monetary contribu-

tions are still underway. Sharon
Leahy in the Residence Life Of-
fice can accept donations directly,
ormoney can be given to hall “ham-
merheads.”

In addition to raising money;
Habitat is now also focusing on
recruiting volunteers to help with
the actual construction of the
Davidson Habitat home. Volun-
teer sign-ups are located in the
Union pit, the Union basement,
and the library. An information
center and book display on Habitat
for Humanity is also located in the
library.

low formed a sea of flickering
flames toward which Santa made
his descent. As he dangled in mid-
air, Santa flung candy canes into

the darkness, causing many on-

_ lookers to jostle and reach for the

airborne treats, while trying not to
drip the hot wax of their candles on
the surrounding crowd.

hands were occupied with cider,
hot chocolate, and cookies, Santa’s

landing touched off a scattered

round of applause. Moments later,

Santa’s better half, Mrs. ‘Claus,

appeared atop Chambers and
rappelled down into Santa’s open
arms as countless elves pranced
through the crowd or clung for
dear life to the back of a speeding
golf cart.

The Claus’ appearance was
just one highlight of Davidson
College’s annual Christmas cel-
ebration, sponsored by the College
Union Board.

Freshman senator Jonathan
Sipling concurred: “TI think it is
great that Davidson is a place where
the festive and religious aspects of
the holiday can be enjoyed together.
The singing, hot chocolate, nifty
golf cart driving, and lighting of
the trees more than made up formy
belief, held ever since childhood,
that Santa always arrives by means

of flying reindeer.”

The Davidson College Cham-
ber Singers performed from Cham-

‘bers’ front steps, providing the fes-

tivities with musical leadership.
The Chamber Singers guided the
crowd through such well known
pieces as “Frosty the Snowman”
and “Hark the Herald Angels Sing.”
Senior Josh Wood, President of
the Chamber Singers, told the story
of Jesus’ birth, after which the Sing-
ers led onlookers in “Silent Night.”

The Union Christmas party
kicked off at 8 p.m. in the 900
Room, with a well attended back
to back screening of “The Grinch
Who Stole Christmas” and “A
Charlie Brown Christmas.”

The celebration then moved
outside, for Santa’s: visit and the
traditional Chambers tree-lighting
ceremony.

days with Christmas carols played
by a brass band on Chambers’ bal-
cony. Over the band members
heads, however, dangled not Santa
Claus or his wife, but a “beautiful
Moravian Star which was made in
Germany.”

Union Board President Mor-
gan Perry confirmed that an an-
nual outdoor celebration has long
been a part of Davidson holiday
tradition. However, she remarked,
it was not until “the creation of
Davidson Outdoors that someone
came up with the idea of Santa ,
Claus rappeling down the front of
Chambers.”

According to Davidson tradi-
tion, as Tuesday evening’ s festivi-
ties-drew to a close, and students’
candles began to melt into danger-
ously short stubs, the two trees on
either side of Chambers’ poset?
