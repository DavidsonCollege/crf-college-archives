‘Women's soccer endures game vs. Clemson, #7 in region

By Traci Cliett

The scoreboard may have said
4-1 last Tuesday night, but the
women’s.soccer team still felt like
victors after their trying match
against Clemson,

Clemson, ranked seventh in
the region, had just beaten nation-
ally-ranked Vanderbilt the week-
end before. However, the Wild-

- Cats put up a great fight against the

pumped-up Clemson team. Until
the final 15 minutes, it was 1-0
Clemson. After Clemson scored
their second goal, Davidson’s mo-
rale slipped, allowing Clemson to
put two more points on the board in
the last four minutes.

Head Coach Kevin Hundley
thought that Clemson was “the

more deserving team because they
outshot us.”
Buthe went onto say his team”

‘showed intensity and strength, es-

pecially the defense.”

Senior Ellen Sprinkle believes
Clemson is the best team they have
played. “We just got unluckly and
couldn’t score any goals. It was
definitely a team effort, though,

and everyone played really hard
and really well.”

The Wildcats are now 1-0 in
the conference, but 1-4 overall.
They were picked to be first in the
conference, and they remain in that
position. This women’s team is.a
good mix of ages and experience
but is relatively small with only 17
players: four freshmen, six sopho-

mores, three juniors, and four se-
niors. Nearly all of these players
have already started at some point
this season.

This weekend, the Wildcats
travel to the University of Virginia
to face Havard and Kentucky in
tournament play. They returnhome
on Wednesday to take on Wake
Forest.

Men's JV
Soccer

falls short

By Rich Glenn
The Davidson men’s J.V.soc-
cer team’s high Homecoming
hopes fell short on Saturday witha
5-2 loss to the Charlotte club team,
Mangione’s Azzuri. Azzuri, which
has four former Davison varsity
players, including J.V. coach Matt
Spear, is an older and more experi-
enced team. The ‘Cats looked as if
they were en route to an easy vic-
tory when Dennis Buck ‘97 scored
an early goal. However, the more
poised Azzuri team battled back to
. take a 2-1 halftime lead.

After intermission, “Junior”
Romanowski ‘98: mananged to
even the score on a pretty goal
early in the second half. Unfortu-
nately, due to several defensive
lapses, Azzuri poured in three late
goals for a 5-2 victory. The de-
fense was led by Matt Ellis ‘98
while teammates Bryce Jewett ‘97,
Dan Guill ‘98 and Ray Hill ‘97
‘kept the pressure on the Azurri
defense. The ‘Cats record now
stands at 1-2-1 and they hope to
avoid the injuries and red cards
that have plagued them thus far
this season. The Wildcats next
home'game is October 7th against
Catawba where they will try to

reach the .500 mark.

Senior and Rugby Club President MIke Kesslerstands at the front of the Davidson rugby line, leading the Wildcats in
preventing the UNC-Chapel Hill offense from moving the ball past Davidson defenders. Unfortunately, his efforts were not
-- enough to stop the Tarheels, who went on to defeat Davidson in the Wildcat's "rugby Homecoming” game last weekend. The
loss brought Davidson's record to 1-2 after splitting a double-header against UNC-Charlotte two weekends ago. Despite their
losses, however, the rugby team is much stronger this season due to the players’ commitments to their sport over the summer
~ and the nearly two weeks of practice they had prior to their first games earlier this month.

Soccer moves into
season with 3-1 record

home and we will have to play well
to win. They will be ready for us,”
said senior Alex Deegan.

Other than conference games,
the schools share two. common
opponents, UNC-Charlotte and
UCLA. Furman lost to both
schools, one a heartbreaker and the
other a blowout, but to the opposite
teams Davidson fell to. Furman
lost in overtime against the Bruins
two Friday’s ago on Richardson
Field and got whipped by UNC-
Charlotte 4-0 this past week.

“They play a lot of long ball
and havea short field. They are not
playing well, but they always get
up for us,” said senior Tommy
Suter.

So from the past games, there

is no real indication how the teams
match up, but one thing is for sure:
the two teams will wage war. They
don’t like each other and the Wild-
cats are tired of losing to their
conference foe. A win will help the
Cats improve their #10 ranking in
the Southern region.

“We are playing well right
now and it is a good time to play
[Furman]. We still have a ways to
go before wed reach our peak
form,” said head coach ‘Charlie
Slagle.

Fan support will be important
as the Paladins always bring fan
support on the road and especially
at home. Students who can make
the 4:00 game should go. The drive
takes just a couple of hours and this
game is very important to the
team’s success.
