Apathy undermines nationwide SGA‘s

(CPS) — ‘‘You mean there’s a
student senate here?”’

That’s how a Burlington
County College student an-
swered a survey measuring the
effectiveness of the student
government at the small eastern
school. The sentiments, how-
ever, are common to surprising-
ly large numbers of students
who are showing record a-
mounts of apathy towards their
student government.

The symptoms are national.
Voter turnouts for student go-
vernment elections are steadily
dropping. Surveys find most
students are totally uninformed
about student government wor-
kings. The senators themselves
are frequently lackadaisical a-
bout their responsibilities. Stu-
dent leaders running on ‘absur-
dist’ platforms are prolifera-
ting.

To wit:

e Although the average stu-
dent turnout for student elec-
tions has been charted at 20
percent, voting at most schools
is actually much lower. At the
University of Missouri-Kansas
City, voter turnout dropped
from nine percent in 1977 to 5.6
percent last year. Last fall, the
University of North Carolina-
Greensboro experienced an all-
time low in voter turnout —five
percent. A Fort Hays State
College recall election attracted
less than four percent of the
students.

© 965 percent of Florida In-
stitute of Technology students
didn’t know who their college
representative was. Less than
10 percent of the students at
New Mexico State University
knew.

¢ Two senators were axed
last winter at Towson State
College in Maryland for not
showing up for meetings. At
Appalachian State University,
one senator was impeached for
the same reason.

¢ The University of Georgia
student government president
won office last spring by posing
as the ‘‘unknown comedian,”’
and wearing a paper bag over
his head. The student govern-
ment heads at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison led,the Pail
and Shovel party this past
year through a series of self-
admitted foolish expenditures.
Last month, a University of
Missouri-Columbia candidate
won almost half of the student
vote with his ‘‘birthday party”
platform, and by campaigning
in clown suits and strait jack-
ets.

But most importantly, more
schools are finding student
government so worthless they
are abandoning it. Since last
Spring, at least seven schools
have considered abolishing their
Student governments. At two
schools, the effort was success=
ful. At the others, the votes
were very close.

Reasons for the disenchant-
‘ment with student government
. vary from school to school, but
observers point to some ¢om-
mon factors, including the lack
of “bread and butter” issues
dealt with by student govern-
ments, the political maneuver-

The University of North Ca-
rolina-Wilmington student gov-
ernment is currently opposing
efforts by administration to
strip the student legislature of
its allocation power. UNC’s
student government, which has
had problems meeting quorum
in the past semester, currently
controls $110,000 in student
fees. The administration favors
re-dividing the funding respon-
sibilities between the program
board, media and publications
board, and the student legisla-
ture.

Administration control of
student allocations was also an
issue at the University of
Georgia this year. The newly-

all intercollegiate sports.”

The most astonishing feature
of the 1977-78 athletic budget,
however, is the 66 percent drop
in basketball game revenues
since the 1968-69 season. The
basketball program then used
$303,892, but because game
income amounted to $291,463,
the net expense was only
$12,429. The expenditures for
basketball in 1977-78 totaled
$386,027, but because game
income was considerably re-
duced—to $76,137—the College
had to pick up $309,890 of the
total $386,027 basketball bud-
get.

The football program last
year gained $127,354 of its
$361,996 budget from Wildcat
Club contributions and game
income.

Spencer commented, ‘The
potential (gate receipts) is
greater for basketball than foot-
ball; therefore, the net cost
could be smaller—but not it’s
larger.”

“I don’t think football will
ever pay for itself. Basketball
could pay for itself and all the
minor sports,’’ said Cartmill.

Cartmill explained that Da-
vidson’s level of competition
“creates a difficult situation for
us to compete in.”’

“Our problem is that we are

Out-going president Billy
Key told the Red and Black that
SGA had “lost its main pur-

pose’’ when UG administrators _

re-assigned the task of club
allocations. The schools and
colleges now allocate money to
associated clubs, while funding
for the larger groups—such as
the school’s union—is decided
by an administration-appointed
committee,

money were the only real things
the Senate had to do,” com-
plained former vice-president
Debbie Barnes.

give grant-in-aids across the
board, whereas we only give
them in basketball,” he added.

‘This scheduling and level of
competition is not my decision,

*but that of the Trustees,” he
noted.

Recruiting costs in basketball
(included in a category along
with pre-season and film expen-
ses) increased from $23,414 in
1968-69 to $70,711 in 1977-78.

Davidson is to compete for
quality professors with univer-
sities like Duke, Chapel Hill,
and Vanderbilt.’’ Manning no-
ted that these universities are
drawing quality professors from
Davidson with higher salary
offers.

Classics Professor Mark Da-
vies said, ‘‘budget priorities
need to be reordered to protect
the financial future of younger
faculty members.’’ He noted
that professors are ‘‘rightly
expected to make a wider
service to the community as.a
whole and this lessens market-
ability in the long run.”’

Spencer urged faculty mem-
bers ‘‘not to construe this
meeting one way or another.”

“The basketball picture has changed
rapidly in the last six or seven years.
Before, money wasn’t such a problem.
There were very few scholarship pro-
grams. But now there are recruiting
wars. Perhaps certain institutions are
lowering their academic standards to al-

low in athletes.”

“Davidson’s athletic budget falls into
an intermediate category among colleges
and universities. But should the basket-
ball program become successful again it
could help pay for minor sports.”’

Whether or not the article is accurate
in its claims, it has given ammunition to
those who would like to see Davidson

modify its athletic program.

Classics professor Mark Davies, a
known critic of Davidson’s Athletic
Program, pointed out that ‘“‘we may need
basketball to participate in North Caro-
lina society, considering the basketball

mania here.”

‘five or ten years.

One of Richard Terry’s major
duties as Vice President will be
to head the recently restruc-
tured Residence Hall Council.

Terry noted that Jackson
restructured the Council so as
to include more student mem-
bers. He hopes that ‘‘in the
wake of the Honor Code furor,
perhaps this will add a little bite
to the Code of Responsibility.”
In other words, if a student sees
a violation he will feel more at
ease going to talk to another
student.

Jackson hopes to meet ano-
ther goal of his campaign by
always being at a designated
spot during Coffee and Cokes.

“Eventually it will evolve that
people will always expect us at
that spot. And if people want to
have any input, here’s one way
that would be a painless way of
doing it,”’ he conjectured.

Finally, Jackson and Terry
commented on the fact that

Terry was unopposed. Terry -
