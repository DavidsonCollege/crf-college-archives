IN SYMPATHY
the Davidsonian wishes to express deep-
est sympathy to James Hogg in his be-
reavement due to the loss of his father.

DR. LINGLE—

Davidson College has recently closed anoth-
er chapter of its history and has begun a new
one—a new president has been inaugurated.
With the cooperation of all connections of the
school he is expected to carry the college
through its next era with the continual pro-
gress that has preceeded. Our hearty wel-
come goes to him with best wishes for a suc-
cessful presidency.

He succeeds a man whose love of the col- |
lege is hard to excell. Perhaps the best ex- |
pression of the students’ feeling toward their
retiring president has been spoken by Hank
Bahnson, president of the Student Body. His
address which was delivered to Dr. Lingle and
the students is, printed below:

contact of the students with the man himself
speak more eloquently than any collection of
syllables I might compose. In the years that
we as students have known him we have come !
t6 recognize and appreciate his lofty character |
and ideals, his dignity without haughtiness, |
his ability to stand: solid on the principles
which he and we hold dear, his deep love and
appreciation of his fellow man, his joy in the
simple and true pleasures of life, and above all,

climaxed a brilliant college career.

At Davidson, Mr. Pritchett said that he en-
joyed philésophy more than any other subject
taken, From his “Y” secretary post at Da-
vidson, he entered Union Theological Sem-
inary in Richmond. So fine was his record at
Union that at the completion of his course he
was offered the Hogg Fellowship, and so re-
mained at Union for a year of research and to
receive his Bachelor of Theology degree.

(by this she meant he is unafraid to speak out
what he knows to be true and right), and his
sincerity. T look forward to Stinday for he is
a great comfort and inspiration even to us

When one drops in at the Presbyterian
manse just next to the college infirmary, he
receives a warm welcome from a° fine Chris-

receives a cordial welcome from Mrs. Prit-

Mary Anna, age three-and-a-half years, or
little Peggy Jane, just one-and-a-half years

Mrs. Pritchett, like her husband, is a native

Letters to

the Editor

From Chancellor of Vanderbilt:

Editor, the Davidsonian:

A visit to Davidson College
leaves the impression that it is one
of the really excellent liberal arts
colleges of the country. Its reputa-
tion for quality of scholarship and
of men in both the faculty and the
student body is fully confirmed.

Under the wise leadership of
President Lingle the institution has
achieved an enviable position of
leadership among American col-
leges. With the increased facilities
now being provided and with its
able new President, Dr. Cunning-
ham, a new era of progress seems
assured. I want to congratulate
the students of Davidson College
on the opportunity for real educa-
tion which is theirs. .

A considerable number of your
graduates enroll in the graduate or
professional schools of Vanderbilt
University each year. The faculties
of these schools refer* with en-
thusiasm to the quality of men who

From Senior Non-Fraternity
Dear Tony:
Well, there

discussion about a faction
between the fraternity and non-
fraternity groups on the campus, It
appears that the frat boys see no
dissention. or. feeling and therefore
no problem at all, while the non-
frats seem pretty certain that there
is a problem. There must have been
something real in this
though, or the question would not
have been so widely cussed and dis-
cussed,

It is probably true that there is
feeling among the frat
groups against the non-frats, but
only .an unconscious looking down
on those who may not be members
of the exclusive clique. Naturally,
then, these fraternity boys would
say that they didn’t see any feeling

was there at all. I think that it is
likewise true that the non-frats
have no enmity towards the frats,
only a little resentment of that
unconscious attitude of the frat
boys that makes him feel left out.
To the non-frat, the frat man ap-
pears tied up in his fraternity sec-
rets and undesirous of the company
of the non-frat because he 1$“hot

After several years of experience,
upperclassmen have found that the
best advice to give to freshmen
who have succumbed to that mys-
terious malady known international-
ly as “Spring Fever,” is the follow-
ing set of rules: To wit: (1) Never
accept rides from seniors. It is
best to decline even a ride from the
fraternity house to the boarding
house, this will ‘develop into
longer rides, possibly a Kentucky
Derby weekend. (2) If you must
take sunbaths, take a_ textbook
with you. Although it's bad on the
peepers, it waxes well-on the re-
port card. (3) Write your girl more
often. This will serve to keep any
local

as

romances. from blossoming
that would detract you from your

studies. (4) Stop drefming about

-|your plans for the. summer. June
