Alumnus to be new Dean of Admissions

By HEIDI HOOKER

College President John
Kuykendall announced last Friday
that James P. Hendrix, Jr., head-
master of Greensboro Day
School, has been named Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aid.

Hendrix, 44, of Greensboro,
will begin his duties July 1, 1986.
He replaces John Griffith, who
became Vice President for De-
velopment this fall after serving as
Dean of Admissions and Financial
Aid since 1979.

“Jim Hendrix’s decision to
join us is a source of genuine de-
light,” Kuykendall said. “He
knows the admissions picture
from a very helpful vantage. He
will bring remarkable personal
and professional strength to an

area of Davidson’s activity of
which we are already especially
proud.”

Hendrix has been headmaster
of Greensboro Day School since
1977. He previously served as
academic dean at Greenhill
School in Dallas, Texas, from
1976-77; head of the department
of history and social studies at
Greenhill from 1973-76; and as
associate professor of history at
Western Caretina from 1971-73.

Hendrix earned an A.B. de-
gree in history from Davidson in
1963, an M.A. from Louisiana
State University in 1968, and a
Ph.D. from Louisiana State in
1973.

He has chaired two accredita-
tion committees of the Southern

Association of Colleges and
Schools and has served as chair-
man of the North Carolina Associ-
ation of Independent Schools. He
has also served on the governor's
Advisory Council on Non-Public
Education and on the Board of
Trustees of St. Andrews College.

Mathematics Professor L.R.
King chaired the search commit-
tee which selected Hendrix. Psy-
chology Professor Ruth Ault, Di-
rector of Alumni Relations Jamie
May, Administrative — Intern
Hunter Roddey and Dana Lemon
also served on the committee. The
search began shortly after May
15, 1985, when the position open-
ing was announced in The Chroni-
cle of Higher Education.

King emphasized the many

Woods reviews “Purpose’

By DAVID BEARCE

Dr. Roger Woods met with
Davidson College’s Strategic
Planning Committee last week to
discuss ‘‘what it means to be Pre-
sbyterian” for Presbyterian-re-
lated schools.

Woods also addressed a group
in the 900 Room this past
Wednesday on whether or not the
college’s Statement of Purpose is
outdated.

In the committee meeting,
Woods said Davidson is now ina
“transition period” as it assumes a
closer relationship with the Pre-
sbyterian Church. Such a transi-
tion requires “open and vocal
dialogue” and “more church fig-
ures in college leadership posi-
tions.”

The greatest problem, Woods
said, concerns “the clarity” of the
Statement of Purpose. He said that
there are ‘‘a lot of things mixed up
together, all in the same para-
graph.” A clear Statement of Pur-
pose is essential because it “al-
lows institutions to focus in on
their priorities.”

“Colleges without a Statement
of Purpose try to become all things
to all people,” Woods added.

For the past three-and-a-half

years, Woods has been Associate
for Higher Education, assigned to
work with Presbyterian-related

schools on their role with the
church.
“The Presbyterian Church

does not own its colleges,” he
said. Instead these institutions are
‘independent colleges funded by
Presbyterians.”

Woods said the relationship
between the Presbyterian Church
and these colleges became
“strained” during the 1960s, and
the two groups are now in the pro-
cess of moving closer together.

He described two factors that
played a part in the strained re-
lationship. First, the colleges
needed federal assistance during
this time, and they “incorrectly
thought” that a looser relationship
with the Presbyterian Church
would lead to more federal
money.

Secondly, the Presbyterian

Church was willing to develop a
less formal relationship with the
colleges because it would thus
have to invest less money into its
affiliated schools.

Following his presentation on
Wednesday, he opened discussion
to the audience. Faculty and stu-
dents expressed the belief that
Davidson's Statement of Purpose
was deeply entrenched in the trad-
ition of the college, and some felt
any change would be very slow
and difficult.

Woods was pleased with his
visit and reported that Davidson is
an “excellent academic institution
and always has been... . The
students confirm that Davidson
has a good faculty.”

As aresult of this visit, Woods
hopes to learn from the “healthy
institutions,” like Davidson, in
order to help some of the “unheal-
thy Presbyterian-related — col-
leges.”

This year Woods has also visi-
ted Rhodes College in Memphis,
TN. and next plans to visit Pre-
sbyterian College in Clinton, S.C.

benefits that Hendrix brings to this
position. He commented that
“Hendrix’s leadership in secon-
dary level education is recognized
both state-wide and beyond... .
The Greensboro Day School flo-
wered under his leadership, and
he has guided the school to a posi-
tion of prominence among inde-
pendent’ schools __ state-wide.
We're very lucky to have him.”
King added that Hendrix is com-
mitted to the liberal arts and is a
person of the “highest integrity.”

Hendrix is committed to
Davidson College as a “faithful
alumnus,” King said. He has been
involved with the Davidson
Alumni Admissions Program,
which provides alumni chapters
that work with prospective stu-

dents.

Associate Dean of Admis-
sions Gardner Roller Ligo and As-
sociate Dean of Financial Aid
Kathleen Stevenson are currently
acting as directors of the office.
Stevenson expressed the staff's
sincere delight with the addition
of Hendrix to the office.

Hendrix is a_ native of
Durham, N.C. At Davidson he
held several positions and played
an active role in student life. He
was the second vice president of
Scabbard and Blade (an honorary
military society). He was member
of the Beaver Club, the Philan-
thropic Literary Society, and the
Young Republican's Club. He
participated in freshman basket-
ball and track.

Student ingenuity brings the true spirit of Halloween to
Davidson.
