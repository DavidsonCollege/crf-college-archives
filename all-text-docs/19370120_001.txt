AVON PLAYERS WILL
PERFORM HERE SOON

Red and Black Masquers Get
Shakespearian Troupe For
February 3

MAKING TOUR OF SOUTH

Will Give “Merchant of Ven-
ice” on Stop Here

On February 3.the Red and
Black Masquers are sponsor-
ing The Avon Players who will
present Shakespeare’s play
“The Merchant of Venice.”
Production is under the direc-
tion of Joseph Selman who
takes the part of Shylock.

Mr. Selman has for many years
been prominent in the casts of New
York successes and as stage direc-
tor he has been none the less prom-
inent. He accomplishes the blend-
ing of dynamic force, color and
magnetism in his directing and act-
ing.

Play At Colleges

The Avon Players have for the
past seven years, been conducting
a very successful tour of the south.
They have been enthusiastically re-
ceived by many of our southern
colleges and schools. Recently
they have played at the University
of Florida, at Agnes Scott, at Win-
throp, at Queens-Chicora, and at
Centre College—and at all these in-
stitutions the Players have played
to capacity houses.

The production has usually been
presented at the various colleges
in co-operation with the English
departments and it is very prob-
able that the English department
here will give credit for seeing the
production. It is hoped that this
commendable performance will be
well attended.

MOR APPROVES
PROPOSED MEASURE

Amendment Affecting Fresh-
man Adviser Passes
This Morning

The newly proposed amend-
ment to the constitution, per-
taining to the election of the
freshman adviser, was passed
by the student body in the vot-
ing held today in the chapel
period. The amendment was
passed by a vote of 371 to 13.

The former amendment to the
constitution, which was defeated by
the vote of the student body Jan-
uary 8, pertained to the election and
duties of the freshman adviser, and

to changing the name of the Court |

of Control.
that the student body would sup-
port the first part of the amend-
ment, headed a committee which
revised it and presented it to the
students as follows:

“Resolved: That the Student
Body Constitution be so amended
as to provide that:

“1. There shall be an adviser to
the Freshman Class, whose duties
shall be to serve as president of the
Freshman Class and to act in advis-
ory capacity in co-operation with
the Y. M. C. A. and the faculty.

“2. He shall be elected from the
rising Senior Class, his election tak-
ing place immediately after the elec-
tion of the Senior Class officers.
The Y. M. C. A. Cabinet, or a-com-
mittee of the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet,
shall submit a list of nominations
for the position. After this list is
submitted the floor shall be open
for further nominations from the
rising Senior Class.

“3. In case of absence or inca-
pacity of the Freshman Adviser, the
president of the Senior Class shall
serve in his position until that va-
cancy is filled. In case of perma-
nent vacancy, it shall be his duty
to cause the Senior Class to elect
a successor as soon as practical.”

The purpose of the above amend-
ment is to help devise a better sys-
tem of orientation and control
which would aidjeach freshman in
acclimating himself to college life.

The committee on health at Mt.
Holyoke College has issued this an-
nual warning to students: Drink
only cider that has been boiled or
pasteurized, and eat only fruit that
has been thoroughly washed.

LYRIC BY HAMILTON, ’19

Picture of Confederate Flags
Given By U. D. C.

The Davidson College Library
has recently come into possession
of several new protraits and pic-
tures pertaining to the history of
the college which should be of in-
terest to the students and faculty.

Composer and Facsimile of
“O Davidson”

B. Ernest Shields of the class
of 1920, composed the music of
“O Davidson” in 1917, while a stu-
dent. His photograph and a fac-
simile copy of the original comps-
sition have been secured by Pro-
fessor Davidson for the ‘proposed
Davidson College Room in the li-
brary. Mr. Shields is also the com-
poser of the S. A. T. C. Blues, the

| Dream Girl of Pi K.A. and other

popular pieces. The author of the
words for “O Davidson,” Mr. E. H.
Hamilton, '19, has not yet replied
to a request for a photograph.

Portrait of the Third President

The Reverend Drury Lacy, D.D.,
third president of Davidson College
has taken his place in the Library's
hall of presidents. This the
sixth oil painting of the College’s
chief executives which has been re-
ceived. The workmanship is of a
high order, being equalled, in the
opinion of many, only by that of the
portrait of President Martin. The
gift comes from President Ben Lacy
of Union Seminary, Mrs. F. W. Van
Wagener of New York, and Col.
Thomas Osborne of Hawaii.

An effort is being made to secure
portraits of all twelve of David-
son’s presidents.

Flags of the Confederacy

The General James ..H. Lane
Chapter of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy in Charlotte
presented the library with an in-
teresting picture in color of the
four flags of the Confederacy. This
was done through the instrumental-
ity of Mrs. N. T. Smith. This chap-
ter has previously given the Col-
lege a handsome Confederate flag
which is displayed in the library
on November 11 and on May 20,
The appropriateness of these things
to Davidson College is well sum-
marized by a member of the class
of '38 wh has written:

“With one hundred years’ ex-
perience Davidson College repre-
sents what seems to me to be the
cultural and educational background
of the real South.”

DR. JOHNSON PRESENT

The Davidson student body
had the privilege of hearing
the Reverend Dr. Albert G.
Barnhouse, pastor of Tenth
Presbyterian Church of Phila-
delphia, at.the chapel exercises
Friday morning. Dr. Albert
Sidney Johnson, pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of

Charlotte, introduced Dr.
Barnhouse who spoke on
“Standards of Religion.”

Dr. Barnhouse developed the
statement that God had made a
standard; but because man failed

to see it, he had created his own

He pointed out that in the eyes
of God our relative positions in sin
are so little separated that it is in-
finitesimal to him, No man is so low
that he cannot be saved, and none
good the
heavenly kingdom except that they
have faith in Jesus Christ. The en-
trance into Christianity not a
way to a better life but into a new
life—a life with God. Instead of
looking on character as a root to
salvation, look at the cross of
Christ and form a character on his.
In this and this alone lies salva-
tion.

Dr. Barnhouse is a graduate of
Princeton University and also the
Princeton Theological Seminary.

War, held a professorship at the
