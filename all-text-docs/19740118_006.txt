Impotent Honor Regulations

A new crop of posters hit the
Davidson campus over the
Christmas holidays. These
posters tell of all of the
benefits of our honor system.

There are two possible ex-
planations of who placed these
posters around the campus.

First. we could believe that
some sincere, yet terribly
Naive person (such as Will
Terry ) who still believes in the
honor system placed them on
the walls to inspire us. the
common herd.

Or. we could believe that
some great satirist placed
them on the walls so that he
could see how many stupid
people took them seriously.
We sincerely believe that the
latter is the case.

Only the most naive idiot
could believe that Davidson's
honor system is working.

Consider stealing. Each
year several thousand dollars’
worth of books di from
the library. We could believe
the optimists when they tell us
that these books are stolen by
outsiders.

Some people paint the pic-
ture of a huge truck driven by
10 blacks from ‘‘across the
tracks” backing up to the
library at night, breaking in
and hauling away books.

They take these books into
Charlotte to their favorite
pawn shop where they get
enough money for tomorrow’s
fix of heroin.

We have only two questions.

Why should these shady
characters steal books rather
than equipment from the
science buildings?

Who buys these books? It is
hard to imagine a large
market for books which have
‘Davidson College’ stamped
all over them. Yet the official
theory holds that a band of off-

campus hoodlums is respon-
sible for the theft.

Many more items on this
campus would be much easier
and much more profitable to
steal. But we _ shouldn't
suggest such things to the
hoodlums who will read this
column.

Petty theft. which is still
stealing, occurs in such
magnitude on this campus
that if every guilty person
were taken to trial the honor
court would be in session con-
stantly for the next 24 years
and seven months.

Students constantly steal
from the eating houses,
bookstore. union, each other,
professors and me.

Plagiarism is another
favorite topic of the honor
system. Considering that the
average Davidson professor
doesn’t read the current
literature in his field, your
get away with anything.

A student is caught
plagiarizing in one of two
cases.

If the student is so stupid as
to turn a plagiarized paper in
to one of the professors who
does read.

Or if the student has a
professor who fell and broke
his leg and had nothing to
waylay the boredom but a
scholarly journal.

A student gets caught
plagiarizing just often enough
to make the honor system ap-
pear to be working.

Move your consideration
from stealing to cheating.
There is not as much evidence
of cheating on this campus as
there is of stealing.

The amount of cheating can-
not be classified as easily as
the amount of goods stolen.

The Oratorio Singers of
Charlotte are planning a per-
formance on Jan. 26 at 8:15
p.m. in Ovens Auditorium.
The group, directed by Donald
Plott, will present ‘Sacred
Service’ by E. Bloch and
“Gloria’’ by F. Poulenc. These
two selections have been
hailed as two of the most ex-
citing pieces in contemporary
music.

UNCC has also scheduled a
number of events to take place
in January. Tomorrow night
at 8:15 UNCC will present the
Rowe Quartet in the Parquet
Room on their campus. The
quartet will perform
Beethoven, Ravel and Piston.
The following day, Jane
Morais will begin a one
woman show in Rowe Gallery
at UNCC. Her work to be
shown will be examples of
“mixed media.’’ She will be
showing from 9-5 p.m. Sunday.

Spoon River Anthology

Spoon River Anthology will be the second major drama
production of the 1973-74 season. It will be presented Wed-
nesday and Friday nights at 8:15 p.m., admission $1, and
Thursday afternoon at 2:15 p.m., admission 50¢.

Our sources tell us that
about 70 percent of the David-
son student body have cheated
in one way or another.
Perhaps this ‘70 percent’’ is
the infamous 70 percent who
go on to do graduate work?

Lying under oath is one of-
fense covered by the honor
code that is virtually never
committed. This statistic is
easily explained by the fact
that no more than 20 people a
year are called on to swear
(although more people volun-
tarily swear daily).

committing an honor
violation? When our sources
were asked about this, it took
20 minutes to get them to stop
laughing. Their only response
then was that they would

There has rarely been a film
as publicized as ‘‘Papillon.’’'
Likewise, there has rarely
been a film which ever deser-
ved such enormous publicity
once it was released.

‘Papillon’ is a good ‘‘B”
movie which suffers from its
own pretentiousness.

The film is extremely
uneven. Franklin J. Schaff-
ner’s direction is at times very
tight and ludicrous. Jerry
Galbraith’s score is a mass of
syrupy mush, while Dalton

they are sent on a mission to

thus bringing the country un-

The plot is simple and clear
in its outlines, but, except for
the divinely inspired ending,
the funniest routines usually
happen despite the plot rather
than because of it.

Other aspects of the movie
have been disciplined for the
sake of the whole. The film is
brief and to the point; the
editing is tight, and the comic
pacing sublime.

Some incidental political
satire almost takes the stature
of a theme, and the two
leading roles are nearly
characterizations. All of this is
very fine for a comedy in

Hoffman (Degas) play
alongside familiar character
actors Victor Joy, Anthony
Zerbe and Don Gordon.

The story is based on the
amazing true-life account of
Henri Charriere about his
escape from the penal colony
of French Guiana. The film
was made on location in
Jamaica and M. Charriere
was a technical advisor.

“Papillon” was intended to
be a classic. For many
reasons, it is not, but this is not
the fault of the stars Hoffman
and McQueen. Both are ex-
cellent and provide the only
bright spot in the film.

“Papillon” suffers from too
much money. The movie was
