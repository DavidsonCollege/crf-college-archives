LIFE CALLING

“The Young Man in Business” was the
subject of a most informative and interest-
ing address given by Mr. John R. Todd, a
prominent architect of New York City,
Tuesday night under the auspices of the
International Relations Club. Mr. Todd
showed a rare touch of sympathy and know-
ledge of the problems confronting the pre-
sent generation of young men in regard to
their vocation in life and his address, while
delivered in a somewhat novel manner, was
of a clearness and comprehension that made
it doubly of interest to all those ppresent.
The speaker was introduced by Rev. J. C.
Rowan, pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Concord, who was a_ former
classmate of Mr. Todd.

Four main points were stressed by Mr.
Todd in his address: Choosing one’s work,
Attitude toward work, Listening, and Fin-
ishing chosen work. These salient points
as Mr. Todd said determine the’ success or
the failure of an individual who seeks fame
and fortune through the channels of com-
mercial life. The choosing of the right
vocation and adhering to that, and a right
attitude toward the conditions of life were
stressed by the speaker, who drew largely
from his own experience.

Listening to the conversation of others
instead of. taking the leading part was also
given as advice to those who would forge
to the front. The finishing.of any chosen
task and perseverance in it through the ups
and downs that are certain to come was
slated by Mr. Todd as the biggest thing in
business life. Confidence in one’s self and
not too much forwardness in dealings with
others was emphasized.

A good sized portion of the student body
heard this splendid address irom such an
authority as Mr. Todd and all seemed to
deeply appreciate it. It was extremely help-
ful to all those contemplating business after
their college life and also to anyone who
desires to know how to meet the problems
of present day business life.

WARREN COX ELECTED
PRESIDENT PANDEINICS

The elections for the Pandeinic officers
of the coming year were held Tuesday,
March 27. The installation will be held at
the next meeting.

The officers elected are as follows: Pres-
ident, W. M. Cox; V. Pres., H. B. Price;
Secretary, F. S. Franklin; Critic, D. B.
Walthall; Second Critic, C. M. S. Mcll-
waine; Treasurer, A. P. Hudgins; Sergeant-
at-arms, L. L. Deck.

The program for the Pandeinic Literary
Society on April 3, though not as full as
usual, was a very good one, coming as it
did directly after the Easter holidays.

The debate was on the Fresh-Soph query;
Resolved, That the United States should
adopt the- Cabinet-parliamentary form of
government. There was one debater for
each side—Garrison for the affirmative and
Deck for the negative. Both speeches were
well prepared but the decision was awarded
to Deck.

The oration was omitted. The declama-
tion by L. B. Huie gave a vivid represen-
tation of 4 Battery Charge as a protest
against the horrors of war, picturing what
people call glorious in war in its naked, ter-
rible form. R. M. Carr brought the pro-
» gram to.a close by delivering his selections
of current events.

D
FRESH-SOPH DEBATERS’
CONTEST FOR PLACES

The old Eu and Phi halls have, in their
day, heard‘ much fiery debating and yet
the past two weeks have caused even their
accustomed ears to prick up with height;
ened interest. The Pandeinics and Philan-
thropics have run off their Fresh-Soph de-
bates. The Eumenean and Metrophilian
societies were also scheduled to have theirs
at this time but "have postponed them until
a later date of which more anon.

In the Philanthropic society there were
five men out. From these, three were to be
chosen with one as alternate. The men se-
lected were Holtshauser, J. E. of the Soph-
omore Class and Ratchford, B. U., White,
W. W._and Barrington, J. C., the last. 1

giving an inkling of the numberous bull-
sessions in which they have engaged.
There were only three men out for the
Pandeinic team from a scheduled eight.
Consequently all three men won “reps”.
These lucky would-be debaters are Harry
Price, A. H. Hollingsworth, Jr., and H. L.
Shaw, Jr. This team will represent the
Pandeinics in their inter-society debate with
the Metrophilian Society. At the same time
the Eumenean society will.debate the Phil-
anthropics. The winners of these two de-
hates will meet for We society Trophy.

SEVEN GOLDEN QUILLS
AWARDED REPORTERS

Golden quills for the past year have re-
cently been awarded to seven members of
the Reporters’ Club. The Golden Quill is
the highest honor in the gift of the Report-
ers’ Club, and is awarded each year to not
more than seven men on the reporter's staff
of the Davidsonian, who have proved most
valuable to the paper in length and nature
of ‘service.

Those receiving quills at this time were,
W. P. Brown, H. B. Price, M. P. Calhoun,
C. M. S. McIlwaine, W. H. Sharpe, D. B.
Walthall and W. F. Galloway.

All of these men have worked long and
faithfully.
the Reporters’ Club, and according to the
constitution of the club, receives a Golden
Quill for that alone. H. B. Price has writ-
ten a great deal in varied lines. M. P. Cal-
houn received this honor for his long and
faithful service. has C. M.S. Mellwaine
handled most of the athletic news. W. H.
Sharpe has managed the Town News for
the last year, one of the hardest jobs on
the paper. 1D. B. Walthall turned in several
big write-ups. W. T°. Galloway has writ-
ten many athletic news articles, and has
also worked on the Press Bureau Staff.

Junior Speaking Goes On

Record Most Brilliant Affair

Staged at Davidson College

(Continued from Page 1)

The Gymn was clothed in the most ap-
propriate attire, and it presented a won-
drously attractive scene to the several hun-
dred guests of the class of ’24. The over-
head and wall decorations were in college
and class colors. No detail was neglected
and the spectacle presented a regular Fifth
Avenue aspect. Myriads of balloons, paper
hats, ’fetti and numerous colored lights lent
tone to the sight.

Ushers in full dress to the music par ex-
cellence of the Simpson Syncopators, direct-
ed the visitors to attractively decorated tables
where they were served in true cabaret
style by the most formal cabaret waiters.

The evening's program was appropriately
begun with an overture, La Chasse Infer-
nal, by Moszkowski, played by the Simp-
son Symphony Orchestra, led by John Simp-
son himself. His musicians were Stewart
Buchanan, Frank Northrop, Johnnie Adams,
and Walter Scott.

Following them the Original Spanish Se-
renaders rendered the Serenata Espana and
numerous popular selections. This troupe
was composed of L. D. Elkins, J. R. Earn-
est, W. H. Crane and R. Q. M. Seago.

One of the most enthusiastically received
numbers of the program was La Dance
d’Aujourdhin’a la Ruth St. Denis and Ted
Shawn, presented by Tevick Bostwick, the
“dancingest man in seven states,” and Dick
Littlejohn, the woman in the case.

The following number was a lecture by
Prof. Rachmaninoff, M.A., Ph.D.,  L.L.D.,
4620 F., in the person of Bob McLeod. The
famous female educator took Everything as
his subject, using an historical background
in a very effective way during the presenta-
tion of his’ remarks.

Tubby and Piggy, Congo Comedians,
whose surnames are Woolfolk and Martin,
of Mr. Gallagher and Shean notoriety, were
applauded voiciferously and recalled to face
the spotlight full half a dozen times. Their
ventriloquist act and their Mean Hard Luck
skit, said to be the product of Tubby’s fer-
tile brain, were parallel to the Mr. Galla-
gher and Mr. Shean comedy in every re-
spect.

WwVOLTA EXPLAINING HIS :

CARD im

BATTERY

TO NAPOLEON oo

—.

How Electrical
Engineering began

T IS not enough to ex-
eriment and to observe
‘in scientific research,
There must also be in-
terpretation. Take the cases of
Galvani and Volta.

One day in 1786 Galvani touched
with his metal instruments the
nerves of a frog’s amputated hind
legs. The legs twitched in a
very life-like way. Even when the
frog’s legs were hung from an iron
railing by copper hooks, the phe-
nomenon persisted. Galvani
knew that he was dealing with
electricity but concluded that the
frog’s legs had in some way gen-
erated the current.

Then came Volta, a contempo-
rary, who said in effect: “ Your in-
terpretation is wrong. Two differ.
ent metals in contact with a moist
nerve set up currents of electricity.
I will prove it without the aid of
frog’s legs.”

e@ Volta piled disks of different
metals one. on top of another and

separated the disks with moist
pieces of cloth. Thus he gene-
rated a steady current. This was
the “ Voltaic pile”—the first bat-
tery, the first generator of
electricity.

Both Galvani and Volta were
careful experimenters, but Volta’s
correct interpretation of effects
gave us electrical engineering.

Napoleon was the outstanding
figure in the days of Galvani and
Volta. He too possessed an active
interest in science but only as an
aid to Napoleon.He little imagined
on examining Volta’s crude battery
that its effect on later civilization
would be fully as profound as that
of his own dynamic personality.

The effects of the work of Gal-
vani and Volta may be traced
through a hundred years of elec-
trical development even to the
Jatest discoveries maae in the Re-
search Laboratories of the Gen-
eral Electric Company.
