DAVIDSON GRIDDERS work extra

hard in practice this week after

losing to Delaware 63-0.

Captains leave Wildcats when gridder
program turns corner toward success

By BRUCE HOLLADAY
Sports Editor

Davidson’s football capt-
ains, Paul Andrews and Jay
Kopel, have seen their share of
difficult times. In their four
seasons with the Wildcats,
Davidson has lost all but a
handfull of games and has
never had a winning season.

Now with only two games
left in their careers, Kopel and
Andrews face the prospect of
leaving a program that is
starting to turn the corner
towards success.

They will both graduate just
when it seems that the Wild-
cats are ready to start winning
again.

During their four years,
Kopel and Andrews have also
seen a lot of changes. Coach
Dave Fagg was replaced by
Coach Ed Farrell their sopho-
more year and according to
Andrews some of the older
players were not content with
the transition.

‘‘The people that played
under Coach Fagg were dissa-
tisfied with the change. A lot
of them lost their starting
positions and instead of work-
ing to get them back they just
sat around and refused to do
anything.”

Kopel agrees that there was
initially an attitude problem

but now feels that Farrell’s —

program is starting to work.
‘‘The program has been
coming along since Coach
Farrell has been Here. It’s just
that it has only surfaced to the
public this year. But-even last
year when we were getting
annihilated we could see a

greater unity and a much

better attitude.”’

Davidson has also deemph-
asized its Division I football
program. Since Kopel and
Andrews first came in favor of
a more or less Division II
schedule. Kopel feels that the
change was necessary in Dav-
idson’s case.

“T never accepted the term
‘deemphasis’. I felt it was
more a matter-of being realis-

fr

tic. Davidson was absurdly
kidding itself when they were
trying to compete with teams
that gave away twice as many
scholarships.’’

Combining football with ac-
ademics has presented a sev-
ere problem for many players
and only six seniors remain
from the original freshmen
players that arrived in David-
son in the fall of 1973. Since
there are so few seniors,
Andrews and Kopel have an
added measure of responsibi-
lity for leading the squad.

“I don’t look at it as a
burden but it is a reality,’’
noted Andrews. ‘‘A lot of
times younger players haven’t
developed a field sense and
sometimes a play or two will

Delaware blasts gridders,

By DAVID HULL
Staff Writer

It was one of those days for
the Davidson football team as
they were annihilated 63-0 by
Delaware last Saturday.

The Wildcat offensive was
ineffective and the defense was
plagued by injuries and fat-
igue.

Coach Ed Farrell aptly des-
cribed the contest when he
commented, ‘“They were sim-
ply a better team. In fact, they
are the toughest team we have
played since I have been at
Davidson. I’m just glad it’s
over.”

The Davidson offense didn’t
show any sign of life until they

get them down. We have to
keep them going.”

For the first time since 1969
a Davidson team won two
games in a row this year and in
all games but Delaware the
Wildcats have been in conten-
tion. Kopel views the program
as getting consistently better.

“We have a lot of confidence
in ourselves this year and a lot
of respect for ourselves. We’re
never been satisfied with any-
thing less than winning and I
feel the program, without a
doubt, is snowballing right
now.”

Andrews has no regrets in
selecting Davidson over other
schools but is bothered by
people who feel that Davidson
football is not to be taken

managed a first down late in
the third quarter. In the first
half, the Wildcats had minus
three yards rushing, none
passing, and were generally
ineffective.

For the game, the Davidson
offense only had 90 yards and
five first downs.

Meanwhile, the Delaware
offense was running up a 28-0
first half lead, captalizing on
early injuries to two of David-
son’s key defensive backs, Jim
Nichols and Lee Wilder.

Nichols will be lost for the
remainder of the season.

Delaware substituted freely
in the second half, using fresh
players that were able to take

seriously.

“A lot of people think that
Davidson football is not real
college football. But the fact. is
that the people who play here
could also have played at
much larger schools. I think
the people at Davidson have a
misconception about the qual-
ity of people that come here to
play.”’

Andrews and Kopel have
been helping to build the
foundation for a winning foot-
ball program but they them-
selves will never play for those
teams. Still each is content
with his contribution to that
hoped-for future success.

“T’m thankful that Paul and
I have been here long enough
to see around the corner.
Those guys two years ago left
seeing nothing in the pro-
gram,’’ Kopel explained.

‘Tt would be nice to be on
the winning teams that we’re
going to have,’’ stated An-
drews, ‘‘but I’m going to get a
lot of satisfaction in knowing
that the program turned ar-
ound while I was here.”

wiping out winning streak

advantage of an exhausted
Davidson defense.

Delaware tallied 28 points in
the third quarter and added a
touchdown in the final quarter
to make the score 63-0.

Farrell cited linebackers
Paul Andrews and Cliff Hester
for an outstanding effort on
defense.

On offense, Farrell felt that
Eddie Setser turned in a solid
performance despite his invol-
vement in Davidson’s unluck-
iest play of the day.

As Delaware kicked off fol-
lowing a third quarter touch-
down, Setser and Virgil Fludd
were back to receive. The ball
was held up by the wind and
hit Setser on the helmet,
rolling into the end zone where
a Delaware player pounced on
it for a touchdown.

‘‘Eddie will probably be
remembered for the infamous
play, but he did make a
tremendous contribution to
our-kicking game. He carried
out his assignments well and
turned in a solid perform-
ance,”’ said Farrell.

Farrell feels that the Dela-
ware game was no indication
of the quality of the Davidson
team.

“Delaware is one of the best
Division II teams.in the
country and they were simply
out of our class. Of the 77
members of their varsity
team, none are freshmen.

Their offensive line consists
of six seniors and one junior. I
consider the game in light of
the specific day and not asa
measure of our overall pro-
gram. We have made tremen-
dous progress this season and
I feel we will continue the
progress.”

In preparation for next
week’s game, Farrell plans to
give the team a chance to
recuperate both physically and

mentally. |
Saturday, the Wildcats,

2-4-1, will play Lafayette, in
their last home game.
