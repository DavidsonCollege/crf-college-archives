“Tech Beats Furman Most Terribly.”
Headlines in The Observer. Furman’s
hopes have peen dashed headlong; for a
comparison of scores shows that David-
son is one touchdown better than Fur-
man. A man who saw the Tech-Furman
game said that the score could have been
“doubled, but that in the last part of the
game whenever Tech got the ball they,
booted it back to the Baptists and prac-
ticed defensive play.

—Wildcats—— :

Citadel seems to have a better team
than usual, for they beat P. C, 20-0, and
Wofford 28-0,

In games so far Tech has averaged 55

ADVANCE DOPE ON WOFFORD.

A battle royal is promised on Sprunt
Field Saturday when Davidson meets
the much touted Wofford football team.
This is the first time the ‘two colleges
have met since.1917 on the gridiron.

Wofford’s team is built up around their
left half, Gibson, a tower of strength on
the offensive. His stellar playing:made
possible their victory over Elon last
week.

Carmichael, right half, and Davis, left
end, have also been showing up well.

Wofford’s weak point this year is their
line. Elon was able to gain almost at
will through it,and the Wildcats can
be expected to pound this department

mercilessly if there is any sign of weak-

ening there.

No comparative scores are available,
but the following are the results from
Wofford’s games this year:

Wofford, 22; N. G. A. C., 0.

Wofford, 0; Citadel, 28,

Wofford, 20; Elon, 7.

Many out-of-town visitors are expect-
ed for the game Saturday. Charlotte
and Mooresville will probably turn out
the largest crowds and most of these
will be there to cheer the, Wildcats to
victory.

The probable line-ups which will face
each other on Sprunt Field Saturday

EU FRESHMAN SOCIETY

The Freshman Eumenean Literary So-
ciety held its weekly meeting Tuesday
night at 7:15. The society was called to
order by the president, after which Pres-
ident Bailey read the scripture and H.
H. Smith led ‘in prayer.

The roll was called and minutes read.
There being no objections to the min-
utes they were adopted as read.

The question of the debate was, “Re-
solved, That the West Virginia miners
were justified in their recent uprising.”
The speakers for the affirmative were
.N. G. Patterson, A. N. Moffatt, and T. F.
Staley; for the negative, H. M. Moss,
McGregor, and W. A. Hay. All the
speeches of the evening were good, and
were enjoyed by the entire society.
Moss’ speech was considered by: the
critic as the best of ‘the evening. The
house and also judges cast their vote in
favor of the negative. The question was

choose both the subject and judges for
the match and vice versa if it is staged
in Virginia,

Wake Forest has been trying to get a
triangular debate with Davidson and
Trinity. However, Trinity is undecided
about this triangle on account of the
triangle she had last year with northern
colleges. It is still hoped that these
three institutions may compose a tri-
angle. Of course, if the above triangle
is secured, each debate will be staged on
neutral ground.

thoroughly discussed by both sides, and
enjoyed very much by the society.

Following the excellent debate of the
evening, the society was favored by
three well delivered declamation by
Ramsey, White, R. G., and Steele, J. T.
The three declamations were good selec-
tions and the declaimers put plenty of
pep in their speeches.

The report of the critic was made. The
report of the vice-president was called
for. He having no report to make, and _
there being no further business to come
before the house, the society adjourned.

FREEMAN AND ROGER McGIRT
STAR IN PHI SOCIETY HALL

With the oratory of Freeman and the
eloquence of McGirt the meeting of the
Phi Society last Thursday night was a
complete success both in interest shown
by the audience and enthusiasm by all
on the program.

As Freeman had to leave early, he
gave his oratfon on the “Young Farm-
er” first. He told of the problems a
young farmer had to face in starting out
in life.

The subject for regular debate was
announced as, “Resolved, That the col-
leges of North Carolina should have
supervision of all high schools within
a hundred mile radius of them.” The
affirmative_defended_the—question with
these points: That this plan will fill
the need of the colleges; that the stand-
ards of the high schools will be raised
by this plan; that the state has not
sufficiently filled this need, and the col-’
elegs must fill it. The negative argued
the question on these grounds: That
the colleges have no time for this super-
vision; that this plan might wipe out
some of the vocational features in the
high schools; that with this system in
force high schools would ‘only prepare
men for the college in that particular
district. The decision was unanimous for
the affirmative. :

In the extemporaneous debate Brown
and Matheson debated long and “hard.
The subject was, “Resolved, That Da-
vidson should retain a maximum of five.
hundred men for a period of five years.”
The judges decided two for the negative.

Before closing, the society decided to
have the next meeting at 10 o’clock next
Thursday night, when there will be a
smoker and a discussion, upon the ad-
visability of dividing into two societies.
Every member of both the Junior and
of the Senior sections is urged to, be
present for this discussion. The regular
program will be carried out the follow-
ing week, ‘‘
