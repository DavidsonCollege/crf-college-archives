Majorities On Campus?
BOULDER, Colo. (CPS) -- A
first-ever projection of the ethnic
makeup of the nation’s public
schools reflects that by 1995, one-
third of U.S. students will be from
minority groups.

“This trend will continue to
grow,” predicts Robin Etter
Zuniga, author of the two-year
study sponsored by The College
Board and the Western Interstate
Commission for Higher Educa-
tion. “The white birth rate has
declined, so the younger the age
group, the more you'll see this
sortofthing. Many states have no
single minority any longer.”

The study says 1995 willalso
see ethnic minorities making upa
majority of students in four states.
In 1989, non-whites and Hispan-
ics made up a majority of high
school graduates in Hawaii, New

lumbia.

Feds Rescue
Ailing Medical School
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (CPS) -- The
U.S. Public Health Service re-
cently announced a $10-million
plan to assist Meharry Medical
College, a prestigious black
medical school that is having
financial problems.

Under an agreement with the
federal agency, the school will
add 10 physicians to the existing
faculty and will receive various
other services.

Meharry, founded in 1876,
didn’t have enough patients at the
campus hospital. In order to re-

Mexico and the District of Co-—
| some expenses were incorrectly

to merge with Nashville’s exist-
ing 200-bed county hospital,
Metro General.
“Meharry is a dynamic, his-
toric school -- they didn’t want us
to continue to have problems,”
says Mary Vowels, assistant vice
president for college relations.

Johns Hopkins

Responds To Charges
BALTIMORE (CPS) -- A pre-
liminary audit that showed sev-
eral expenses claimed by Johns
Hopkins University were inap-
propriate or unallowable for re-
imbursement by the federal gov-
ernment is only partially accu-
rate, officials say.

The school made the interim
response while awaiting a final
audit, said spokesman Dennis
O’ Shea. “We recognized that the
auditors did a good job and that

claimed ... but there were some
specific areas where we dis-
agreed.”

Because the school has its
overhead reimbursement costs
pre-determined by the govern-
ment each year based on money
received the previous year, the
misuse of federal money could
have an effect on reimbursement
from 1989 through 1991.

The funds allegedly misused
in 1987 totaled $89,119 and in-
volved a research trip to Europe’
by the school’s president and a
party fora retiring provost. Johns
Hopkins received $49 million
from the government in 1987.

On Saturday, Sept. 28, the
sounds of German waltzes and
smells of Spanish flan and Sri
Lancan curry will envelop the
Davidson College Union. All of
these treats, and many more, will
be partof Davidson’ s International
Festival.

According to Harin de Silva,
one of the chairmen of the Interna-
tional Committee, each room of
the union will represent one geo-
graphic area of the world. Each
country in that area will have its
own booth in which clothes, books,
jewelry, photographs and food
unique to that country will be dis-
played. World maps will be posted
to show visitors the location of
various countries.

Davidson's 65 international
students will staff the 21 booths
representing their countries. Ac-
cording to Prem Manjooran, who
also chairs the International Com-
mittee, the festival gives interna-
tional students the chance “to
express their diversity, and also
allows the American students and
community visitors to explore this
diversity.”

A new addition to the festival
this year will be the inclusion of an
American booth. Manjooran said
that he has been advocating an
American booth-for several years,
as the United States is just as im-
portant a part.of the international
community as any other country.

The festival will be held from
10:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m., and admis-
sion is free.
