THE DAVIDSONIAN,

OCTOBER 31, 1934

OERGEANT KIRBY
I) TRANOFERRED

Replacement For Staff
Sergeant

Sergeant Jasper Leroy Kirby, a mem-
ber of .the faculty of the Davidson unit
of the R. O. T. C., has been transferred
to Georgia Military Academy, at Col-
lege Park in Georgia. Sergeant Kirby,
who is a Staff Sergeant of the U. S.
Army, was in charge of the office and
clerical help while at Davidson.

Although the regular term is four
years, Sergeant Kirby had been at
Davidson for ten years, having come

here in 1924, During the War he was a
second lieutenant df infantry and served
with the First Division during its en-
tire stay in France. He was intensely
interested in civic affairs, being Com-
mander of the Cornelius and Davidson
posts of the American Legion and prom-
inent in Masonic circles, of which order
he had attained the 32nd degree.

Major John T. Rhett, When asked to
make a statement about Sergeant Kirby,
stated that his work both at
‘and in the community was excellent and
that he was sorry to lose him.

THE loss of Sergeant Kirby will be re-
gretted by the Military Department,
which receives no replacement for him,
and by the students; among whom he had
made many friends during his stay here.
He left Davidson October 27, going di-
rect to his new post at College Park.

Stars Meet Stars
In Touch Football

The greatest touch football stars that
have ever entered Davidson meet on a
green and red cast field just north of the
Chambers Building. An amalgamated
assembly of Phi Kappa, O.D.K.
and other less omnipotent students meet
in daily combat for stardom, ‘

their ruthless opponents.

Harmony is expressed in every move- |

made up entirely of upperclassmen, per-
formed in a manner which was quite
up to professional standards and much
credit is due them for their splendid
performance. The entire group, four-
teen in all, showed creditably and they
too may be complimented.

Plans for the future have been slightly
revised and it has been decided that a
mystery play, either a melodrama or a
comedy is to be given in November, and
if a suitable Christmas play can be work-
ed up, it will be produced shortly before
the holidays. ’

The Masquers have adopted a new
policy: that of inviting select members
of the audience to turn in written critical
opinions of the plays presented. This
will be done in an effort to gather in-
formation and opinions which will en-
able the Masquers to offer better drama
in the future. These criticisms will be
to more intelligent directing and acting
with the view of better dramatic inter-
pretation.

It must be said that the two plays were
well received, but due to unforeseet cir-
cumstances, the Red and Black Mas-
quers were not able to edify the third
play scheduled, GRANDMA PULLS A
STRING.

The Twentieth Century Club of
Davidson met Friday afternoon with
Mrs. J. V. Lore. Prof. Henry Lilly,
the guest speaker, gave an interesting
talk on Winston-Salem, Mrs. James C.

Fleagle Plans To Unite
Two Spanish Chapters

The Sigma Delta Pi held a meeting
on Wednesday night at nine o'clock, in
Shearer Hall. A program was mapped
ott whereby a Spanish topic is chosen
for discussion at one or more subsequent
meetings, in an effort to learn more
about Spain.

Professor Fleagle is trying to make
arrangements to unite the fraternity’s
chapter at the University of South Caro-
lina with the one at Davidson, these two
chapters being the only ones in this sec-
tion of the country. -

At the last meeting bids were issued
to the following: Woody Burns, Johnny
Mackorell, Enid Bowers, and J. W.
White.

All efforts are being made to make this
chapter a bigger and better one, under
the direction of Professors Mleagle and
Blythe, the principal advisors of the or-
ganization.

There ‘follows a list of the officers
elected last Spring to hold office during
the year 1934-35: Hugh Yelverton, pres-

ident; Ray* Richardson, vice-president;
Charles Fort, treasurer; and Tom
lyownie, secretary.

Dr. Lyons Lectures On
Photographic Methods

The Photographic Club held its week-
ly meeting on Wednesday, October 24th,
at four-thirty P.M., in the classroom of
Dr. Lyons.

Dr. Lyons, head of the Biology De-
partment, spoke on the types of back-
grounds which may be used in photo-
graphic procedures. He divided back-
grounds into two general types: the two-
phase typ¢ and the three-phase type of
background. The term “background” as
used has a rather particular meaning in
that it refers to the whole picture rather
than to any single portion. ‘The two-
phase type of picture consists of a main
subject and subordinate but harmonious
elements. In this there is no suggestion
of depth or distance, and is the sort of
general type that one finds in most por-
traits. The three-phase type
of one subject and two or®more groups
of subordinate elements which are har-
moniously related, and which in combi-
nation serve to suggest depth and dis-

consists

tance in the picture. This second type
is a much more artistic and difficult one
than the first. The ambitious photog-
rapher hopes to make successful pictures
of this second type and works toward
such a goal, as it is much more interest-
ing.

Dr. Lyons illustrated the lecture with
prints from his own personal collection
and also invented the classifications. as
presented here.

Divided Glee Club Will
Now Aid Chapel Singing

A division of the Davidsen Glee Club
into two individual groups during the
daily chapel hour was recently inaugu-
rated in order to distribute the volume
of singing more evenly throughout the
entire auditorium. One section of the glee
club, consisting of approximately twenty

Mr. James Christian Pfohl, director

voices so that the volume of singing of
each group would be approximately
equal.

J. H. Powell, of Navasota, Texas, is
an R. O. T. C. officer and a member of
the honorary Physics fraternity, Sigma
Pi Sigma, and is also a member of the
Sigma Phi Epsilon social fraternity.

These eight men are entering the
Gamma chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in
its eleventh anniversary. Davidson,
with the University of North Carolina
and Duke University, are the only in-
stitutions in the state possessing chap-
ters of the nationally known fraternity.
This is a great compliment to the scho-
lastic rating of the college. Davidson is
the smallest of the aforementioned
schools and has one of the highest scho-
lastic ratings in the South. ‘Twenty-four
members of the Davidson Faculty are
members of Phi Beta Kappa.

Dr. Price H. Gwynn, head of the De-
partment of Religious Education at
Davidson College, occupied the pulpit of

that is different from any

HESE Turkish tobaccos
are the only tobaccos of
foreign cultivation that are
used to any great extent in
making American cigarettes.
Turkish tobaccos are famous
for their spicy aroma, and a
blend of the right kinds of
Turkish tobacco with our own
home-grown tobaccos is better
than any one kind used alone.

In Chesterfield we balance
mild, ripe tobaccos grown
in this country with just the

right amounts of the right
kinds of Turkish.

It is by blending and cross-
blending these different tobac-
cos that we make Chesterfield
the cigarette that’s milder, the
cigarette that tastes better.
