The men’s cross country team completed
their 2008 season with a frustrating finish at
the Southern Conference Championship.

The 8k race was held on the rolling,
grassy trails of the Roger Milliken Research
Center in Spartanburg, S.C. Approximately
two months earlier, the Wildcats got the sea-
son kicked off in style with a third-place fin-
ish at the Eye Opener-USC Upstate, which
was held on the same course as Saturday’s
race.

On Saturday, the Wildcats couldn’t over-
come the injury bug, which hadn’t been
a problem, for the most part, in their 2008
campaign. Two of the Wildcats’ top perform-
ers did not finish the race and thus their time
could not count towards the team total.

When Coach Andrew was asked about the
difficult circumstances, he said, “Unfortunate
circumstances for both Alex [Hoyt ’09] and
Tom [Divinnie ’10] obviously hurt us. They
gave it their best. Alex collapsed about 100m
from the finish and was unable to finish. He
was just behind Lance at that point. Tom had
an ankle injury coming into the race and he
made it through almost four miles before be-
ing forced to drop [out].”

The race consisted of Davidson and the
other 10 teams in the Southern Conference.
The Wildcats finished in eighth place with
a score of 198 points, 148 points behind the
victorious team from Appalachian State Uni-
versity.

The other top-five team finishers behind
ASU were University of Tennessee-Chatta-
nooga (57 points), Furman University (70

points), Samford University (124 points) and’

University of North Carolina-Greensboro
(126 points).

The Wildcats were led by Lance Harden
09, who earned second Team All-Confer-
ence honors with his 11th-place finish. Hard-
en ran the race in 25:28. Following Harden
were Charlie Schmitt ’11 (33rd/ 26:24), Ryan

211 (67th/ 28:13).

There were a total of 88 runners who par-
ticipated in this year’s Southern Conference
Championship. Even though the season may
have ended on a sour note, Coach Andrew
was pleased with his team’s effort.

“Well, it didn’t turn out the way we had
hoped. Not for lack of effort, though. The
guys did [what] we wanted.”

The men’s cross country team will return
10 of this year’s 13 members next year.

The women’s cross country team ended
their 2008 season with a strong showing at
the Southern Conference Championship.
Last Saturday, the Wildcats finished in fifth
place in a 5K race in Spartanburg, S.C. This
race was against the other 11 teams that make
up the SoCon.

Caroline Sanker ’09 led the Wildcats
with an individual finish of eighth place with
a time of 18:13. That finish gave her All-So-
Con honors for the third consecutive season.

Other top finishers for the Wildcats were
Lauren Childs 711 (21st/ 18:50), Danielle
Ruggieri ’11 (22nd/ 18:50), Heather Conn-
aroe "11 (3ist/ 19:02) and Emily King ‘09
(45th/ 19:19).

Other finishers for the ’Cats included
Sarah Cline ’11 (64th/ 19:49), Brooke Sen-
ken 712 (69th/ 19:56) and Katy Swain 712
(77th/ 20:24).

There were a total of 98 women who ran
in the event. UT-Chattanooga claimed the
team title with 60 points while Davidson’s
127 points was good enough for fifth place.

Overall, The Wildcats had a very good
season which showed a combination of vet-
eran senior leadership and talented lower
classmen.

Next fall, the team will return 12 of the
16 runners from this year’s team and will
once again hope to compete for a Southern
Conference Championship.
