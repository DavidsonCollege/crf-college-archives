By STEVE MANK

The Alarm’s short American care-
er began with the sudden success of
their self-titled debut E.P. That was
followed soon with a supporting role in
U2’s tour last year. The attention the
tour brought them did no harm indeed,
and they soon became the critics’ pet,
labled “The Clash with accoustic
guitars.”

Their music — which was actually
far more than a new way of playing the
Clash — caught the ears of Pretenders’
1984 tour promoters and now the
band, unknown six months ago, is no
longer merely a supporting act but bil-
led as a “special guest*”

But 1984 is nota year of laurel rest-
ing or special guesting for the Alarm; it
is the year of their brilliant debut L.P.
Declaration.

The album is a powerful compila-
tion of twelve anthems of freedom and
glorious revolution that carry at once
the lulling intimacy of an accoustic
guitar and the pounding, force of a

snare drum.

The key to the art of the Alarm is
recognition. They choose from a wide
pool of influences, which they mesh
subtley into a style of their own. The
tone switches from a manic Bob Dylan
to a manic Grateful Dead to a manic
Queen — never the same, but always
manic.

The album opens with a frantic or-
chestra of accoustic guitars for the
two-line introductory title — track.
Guitar flourish, drum beat, and the
boys are off on a delicate, yet never
gentle, remake of “Marching On” off
the E.P.

The barrage continues with a string
of unrelenting marches long = on
dynamism that refuses to let up until
there's no disc left.

“Sixty Eight Guns” is probably the
best song on the album. It has an air of
forboding but does not stray too far
from a certain singalong quality. The
middle sequence features almost
frightening spartan instumentation that

a. aKwh few wan stun

is a guaranteed crowd pleaser even
when there is only a crowd of one.

“The Stand (A _ Prophesy),”
another outstanding track, is.an acous-
tic guitar and harmonica refrain and
follow-up to the band’s hit single off
The Alarm.

In spite of all the good qualities of
the L. P., the lyrics are, at times, lack-
ing. Where they could have made a

powerful statement the band often opts
for child-like idealism.

The musicianship, however, is ex-
cellent. Drummer Twist and bassist
Eddie MacDonald work in complete
cohesion while the rhythmic guitars of
Dave Sharp and Mike Peters (and oc-
casionally MacDonald) cut through
the air like a machete through under-
brush. Vocals, sung by all members,
but especially Peters, never falter in
expressiveness, intensity, or impor-
tance.

But importance is the source of the
band’s success. They’re not very good
looking. Neither are they material for
the world of pop teen idoldom. The
lyrics are sometimes imperfect. Yet
every minute of every cut doesn’t just
demand attention, it forcibly wrenches
it away from you. If The Clash are con-
cerned about a band that sometimes
sounds like them they shouldn’t be.
What The Clash should worry about is
having to relinquish their crown as
“the only band that matters.”
