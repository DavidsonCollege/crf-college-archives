A. G. SPALDING & BROS.
THE COMMISSARY

Davidscn this year will in all proba-
bility be represented by the best team
in her history. Our former Coach “Bill”
has said that Davidscn has the best ma-
terial and the best prospects this year
that she has ever had. Most of last
year’s team and reserves have returned,
as well as several men from the service,
and an abundance of guod new material.
‘Not only this but we believe that we
i haveyone of the very best coaches in the
countyy in Coach Crayton and one who
we afe glad to say is like Coach “Bill.”

Spann, our quarterback of the past
two seasons and captain of the Red and
| Black machine this year, is playing his
‘old position, Dick, of Clemson Col-
lege; Cassel and Ormand are all show-
ling up well in this important position.
“Jack” Black, an old Davidson player,
{well known throughout the South and a
tower of strength on former, teams, is
back in his old position in the Sack field.
. McAlister, of last year’s team; Martin,
‘of Auburn; Shepherd, of A. & E., and
i McFadden, of last year’s reserves, are
all showing up exceedingly well in the
ibackfield. Douglas, of last year’s team ;
| Harris, of the 1917 reserves; G. Miley,
of last year’s reserves, and RK. Black, of
A. & E., are running a close race for
the end pesitions. In the line Brady
and McMaster, veterans of former
teams; Hammett, a mainstay on Clem-
,sin’s team last year; Romefelt, a veter-
an of the 1917 reserves; LaFar, a re-
serve of last year, and Nimacks, who
returns from the service, are all work-
ing hard and will probably occupy
berths on the tcam. Besides these men
there is an abundance of good material
in the new men. “These men are work-
ing hard and will in all probability push
someone hard fer a place on the var-
sity.

Frank Hail, manager of the “Wild-
cats,” has arranged an excellent sched-
ule and as usual Davidson will meet
,some of the strongest teams in the
South. The first game will be played
with Guilford College at Winston-Sa-
lem, September 20. ‘The following
week, September 27, the Wildcats will
play Wake Forest ac Wake Forest.
Among the teams to be played are Clem-
son, Washington and Lee, U.S. C., V.
M. I., Georgia Tech, A. & E., U.N.
C., Presbyterian College of S. C., and
Furman. One game, that with Presby-
terian College, will be played on the
local field. The A. & FE. game will be
played in Charlotte and a special train
will probably take the student body
down to see the “Wildcats” play Coach
Fetzer’s team. The “Wildcats” are
working hard and Davidson stands sol-
idly behind them.

noon-day dispensation of hash vast
crowds began to gather around Sprunt.
initiation field to sce the annual battle’
royal. ‘The high stadium was crowded
to overflowing, and the anxious cries of
the restless mob showed that much pep
(and money) was up. At first the odds

were 3 to | against the sophs, but when 4,

these illustrious hot bloods came pranc-
ing out attired in garments of conflict
with war paint on their faces enthusi-
asm in the abilities of the infant class
began to dwindle. Amid great cheers
Birchie Romefelt climbed the mound
and prepared to descend upon the deli-.
cate young specimens of verdure without
any idea of even allowing them to meas-
ure the speed of those lightning balls..
For five thrilling innings he pitched air-
tight ball, allowing only two hits.
Birchie is beyond doubt a wonder, but
the best authorities say that the fresh
defeat was merely a piece of hard luck,
for the fresh had just picked out a pinch
hitter and Gunn was next up when the
whistle blew-—and loaded too. The
only thing that saved Dutch Henge-
veld's rep is the fact that he graduated
last year, for nine gritty fresh gave con-
clusive evidence that their batting aver-
age will push nine hundred close, Al-
though five men were employed to keep
score, it was impossible to tell errors
from hits, so cne hit has been ascribed‘
to cach side. No attempt was made to
keep a record of errors, but we hope that
when a later edition of calculus comes
from the press we shall be able to print
an approximate figure. Suffice it to say
that there was only glory enough for
all, and we predict that Coach Crayton
will have no trouble in picking out a
winning team next spring if only he re-
member these fresh.

“Have backbone enough to live as the
folks at home wish you to, You may
want to go back some time.” This quo-
tation is taken from the Kansas State
Collegian and it is given here because it
is good enough to repeat if it will cause
some one to think for a moment.

Are you now taking advantage of
every opportunity offered you? Do you
not often waste your time by getting
with “the crowd” during study hours?
Would you like for the folks at home
to know what you are doing right now? |
If so, would they welcome you back as’
they do? |

Some students may be able to pass the
above examination but in every student |
body there will be found those who can-!
not. ‘They may try to excuse themselves
by saying that they are ‘as good as the
others” in their classes but this excuse is
not valid. If those in their classes can-
not pass, it is time for them to make |
some change. ‘The days spent in school:
fare possibly of more importance to the!
fitudent than any others; for in later life’
fhe will have to build on the foundation’
laid here, and the foundation deter- ;

FORMING HABITS.

We are constantly reminded of the
fact that our college days are habit-
forming days. Whether we form good
or bad habits is left largely to the indi-
vidual. To the new men especially we
wish to drop this hint: You can form
no better or more profitable habit than
visiting the library regularly. Set aside
an hour each day for your “library
hour”’—put it on your schedule so that
you will not forget it while you are
forming this excellent habit, and soon
you will not have to refer to your sched-
uile—you will be looking forward to this
