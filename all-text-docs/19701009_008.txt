“It is up to us whether we
can sink or swim,” said
Steve Heckard in assessing
the Wildcat Club’s position in
funding the football program.

The Wildcat Club took
over: the funding of the foot-
ball program as a result of
the Spencer Commission and
a trustees meeting last wint-
er,

When the Spencer Com-
mission report recommended
that the football program
move toward desubsidization,
they were suggesting that
the amount of scholarship
money awarded to a foot-

ball player be based on fin-.

ancial need.

At the trustees winter meet-
ing last year, they decided
fo finance the football pro-
gram through a smaller a-
mount from the college gen-
eral fund, the remainder be-

BLOCKED PENALTY ATTEMPT

Last November the Spencer Commission
Report on athletics was made public, mak-
ing many recommendations on how the ath-
letic program should be altered.

One recommendation was that the football

program should move

toward desubsidiza-

tion. Progress on this phase will be explored
this week with other reports on recommend-
ations of the commission being carried in the
next three issues of THE DAVIDSONIAN.

ing made up through ear-
marked contributions.

Little progress toward the
raising of funds was made
last spring and summer.

In late August, Steve Heck-
ard was appointed by Presi-
dent Samuel Spencer as ex-
ecutive director of the Wild-
Cat Club and Wildcat Ath-
letic Fund with the purpose
of raising funds for football
scholarships.

Heckard, a 27-year-old na-
tive of Winston-Salem, —-play-
ed quarterback and end at
Davidson. from 1963 to 1965.

After three years with the
Los Angeles Rams he com-
pleted a tour of duty with the
army where he served as an
assistant football coach at
West Point.

“Presently we have raised
$35,000 toward our goal of
$150,000, which is supposed
to be met by January. $28,-

. 000 of the $35,000 was given

to the football program be-
fore Heckard’s job was creat-
ed.

The new -method-of funding
the football program will
take effect for the 1971. sea-

College general fund will be
given to each of the 52 foot-
ball .players on scholarship.

The $150,000 will be used
to implement these scholar-
ships and defray other foot-
ball expenses.

Last year, the total foot-
ball scholarship budget was
about $120,000. The new pro-
gram is expected to save the
college about $100,000 a year.

Heckard is optimistic about
reaching the goal and has
imade definite plans to meet
it.

On Oct. 16, the Friday be-
fore homecoming, a dinner is
scheduled at Myers Park
County Club for the Wild-
cat Club members. Many im-
portant members of the club
have been invited and here
outlines for the fund drive
will be presented.

Both Heckard and Coach
Dave Fagg will speak to the
Wildcat Club members on
the future of Davidson’s foot-
ball program. Heckard esti-
mated that between 75 to 100
members will be in attend-
HAC.C. :
~ Affer the banquet, Heckard
explained that it will be his
job ‘to identify groups of
people who can give to the
program.”

The two groups he stressed
that need to be_ located
and organized are former
football players and Wildcat
Club members.

Heckard related that from
mid-October to December
will be. his busiest period.
He expects to be traveling
across the country and _ at-
tempt to sell alumni on the
value of giving to the pro-
gram.

“This effort to fund the
football program has receiv-
ed good vocal support so
fat,” Heckard said. “What
we need to do now is con-
vert this vocal support into
tangible results.’’

‘Heckard is not on his own
in selling the new program.
His work is being coordinat-
ed with Howard Arbuckle,
‘Director of Alumni Affairs,
and Russell A. Strong, Di-
rector of Public Informa-
tion.

Davidson head-coach Dave
Fagg was elected and re-

~Keved at Heckard’s work.

“This is one of the best
things that has happened
since I became coach,”
Fagg said. ‘The fund rais-
ing has been on my mind a
lot. (Now I can concentrate
more on coaching the foot-
ball team.

Wildcats Tackle
Bisons At Home

By JOE EARLE
Sports Writer

‘Davidson's Wildcats will
take on Bucknell’s blue and
gold Bisons tomorrow at 2
p.m. on Richardson Field.

‘Bucknell will be defending
a 1-2 record after losses to
Baldwin-Wallace ‘College and
Temple University and a
homecoming victory over
Gettysburg College.

The Bisons feature a run-
ning attack led by Don Gia-
comelli at halfback and
Rick Diez at fullback. Both
gained over 100 yards carry-
ing the ball against Gettys-
burg last week.

Diez tis a sophomore who
did not start at the first of
“the season, but now—main-
tains the highest rushing
average on the Bucknell of-
fense.

Perhaps the biggest pro-
blem the Bisons will present
offensively is the passing of
a pair of quarterbacks. Both
Greg Doviak and . Howard
Burke fill the key slot and
both pass a great deal of.the
time.

‘Burke is another  sopho-
more surprise. He first saw
action against Baldwin-Wal-
lace late in the game and

almost turned the tide. The

Bisons came from under a
23-0 halftime deficit to lose
by 29-21. Burke hit a touch-
down pass, and then com-
pleted anofher
