Flames Destroy Interior of
Campus Rendezvous Dur-
ing Holidays

The new renovated Student
Store built up from the char-
red remains of the old store
will open tomorrow, Jan. 13,
according to Co - Manager

. Lawrence Reid.

On Tuesday night. Dec. 21, the

store caught fire and before it was’

discovered a sizeable blaze had be-
gun, which resulted in tle loss of
considerable goods and property.

As Jim Paltard was passing near ,
the store he noticed smoke around

it, and suspecting a fire, reported
it at once. The night watchman
,entered the building and found a
smouldering blaze. Soon the fire
department arrived and quickly had
the blaze under control, although
it had already destroyed the inter-
ior of the building and burned the
ceiling badly. ,
The stock in the main part of
the store was a coniplete-loss, «due
to the blaze itself and also the
water. The show cases and other
interior equipment were entirely
ruined. The total damage of the
fire amounted to approximately
$1,500. Insurance covered the
whole building and the stock. but
as is always the case, the store had
to lose about one-fourth the vatue
of the stock, as the insurance never
covers the entire value of it. ©

Artists Show
Modern Work

The Amereat Artists Group Ex-
hibition of original etchings, wood-
cuts, lithographs, and stencils was
on display in Chambers Building
last week, and attracted much at-
tention from students and the
public.

Ranging in vatiety from surreal-
istic and impressionistic to the ac-
curate and painstaking detail of the
better etchings «and lithographs.
this exhibition is composed of the
works of some of the mast famous
contemporary Ametican artists.
This is one of twemty like it which
are touring the country on regular
itineraries, and it iis estimated half
a million saw the exhibit in 760
places last year.

Included among the better artists
whose work is i the exhibit are:
Grant Wood and Paul Cadmus, to
whont “Life” has devoted some
space; and Rockwell Kent, acknow-
ledged as one of the best illustra-
tors of today.

Perhaps the most intriguing pic-
ture of the whole exhibit was a
stencil by Henry Billings, “Marine
Elements,” which was what _ the
name implies “a pleasing arrange-
ment of various sea-going appara-
tus, done in the surrealistic style.”

In a more easily uriderstood and
appreciated class were Agnes Tait's
two prints, “Felicity” and “Aristo-
erat.’ remarkably life-like portraits
“ol cats. “Then Joe Jones’ “Waste-
land” gave an unforgettable picture
of desolation. The peaceful Vir-
ginia countryside is captured by
the brush of J. J. Lankes in ‘Sun-
day Afternoon.”

The American Artists Group was
formed with the purpose of bring-
ing the graphic arts of today to the
average man and woman, and at as
low a cost as possible.

Criticism Given By Stu-

What's wrong with
“Davidsonian?” Aside from
Chubby King’s column, — the
topic of “Criticism and Sug-
gestions” proved to be the
most popular subject in the re-
cent poll of the student body.
Over 50 per cent of the baliois
cast had some suggestion as to the
good or the fault of the paper.
Some were humorous answer
some conscientious, some criticis-
ing, and others praising, but mest
of the answers covered topes of |
the foitowing: more letters to the
editor, a collegiate digest every
week, more pictures of Davidson
life and more controversal editor-
ials.. However, as a whole, the stu-
dent_body seemed to have a high
regard for the paper as it stands.
