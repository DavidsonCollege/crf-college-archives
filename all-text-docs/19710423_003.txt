Culprits Tell Own Story
On ROTC Smoke Bomb

the ROTC department. on

Thursday night, . April 19,
said in an interview Wednes-
day that the act was politi-
cally motivated.

The bomb was a World
Var II vintage U. S. Army
smoke bomb, they said., As
their reasons for planting
the bomb, the two outlined a
general objection to war and
to the aggressive military
defense stance employed by
the United States.

“We see no justification
for any part of the war ef-
fort to be located on the
Davidson campus. We_ wish
to make the ROTC depart-
ment feel unwanted,” they
said.

The bomb was filled. with
a magnesium compoud,
they said, but they did not
know. exactly what kind.
During the interview, they
produced the lid to the can-
ister. :

The two stated that they
had had the bomb for some
time. ‘‘We considered doing
it during the daytime. We
wanted the smoke to be
seen, and to attract a _ lot
of people.

“We had been planning for
some time to use the bomb.
But we hadn’t planned. to do
it that night until we saw

Sittler Ponders Theology
Of Man And Environment

By JOE SMITH
Associate Editor

Western man has strayed
from the original biblical un-
derstanding of his relation-
ship to nature and the result
ing ‘destruction of the envi-
ronment has endangered his
spiritual as well as physical
life. This was the line of ar-
gumentation taken by. Dr.
Joseph Sittler in a Pied
mont lecture entitled ‘‘The
ology and Ecology,” given
in the Morrison Room on
April 21.

Sittler, a professor at the
University of Chicago Divin-
ity School, began his discus
sion by declaring ‘“‘illusions”’

of Belk Dorm, was unlock.
ed and standing open. It was
wedged open and the lights
were on,” the student said.

The lights in the ROTC
department, located in the
basement section of Belk,

are normally left on = at
night.

“We went in and looked
around for nearly half an
hour first,” they said. ‘This
was at about 9:15 ‘p.m. Then
we went and got the smoke
bomb and came back.

“We placed the bomb so
that the smoke would be
seen. This was at about 9:45
p.m. Then we left.”

The two stated that they
did not remain to see the
crowd. According to George
Hampton, Davidson fire
chief, the fire department
received a call at 10:05 p.m.
By 10:30, a large crowd had
gathered, estimated at
around 300 people, though
many estimates varied.

Both students emphasized
the idea of protest against the
war as the motive for the act.
They said that they did not
wish to cause any injury, or
to steal anything while they
were there because ‘‘that
wasn't consistent with our
ideas of a protest.”

to be two beliefs which he
said were generally) accept-
ed as true: (1) that the prob-
lems of the environment can
be dealt with through legis-
lation; (2) that
adequate resources are sup-
plied, can solve the problems
which it has helped to make.

science, if

The professor then went on
to point outsthat the charg
es leveled at the Christian
church as a prime mover in
the destruction of the envi-
ronment were, to a great ex-
tent, valid.

He went on to point out
that biblical speech is ecol-
ogical, in that all things are
described in terms of the en-
Vironment in which they ex
ist.

Man is defined in this way
asa being for which. exist-
ence is thought of in terms

of subsistence, the relation-
ship to those beings around
him, and his relationship to
the ‘‘whole.rich and support-
ive earth.”

One problem in = modern
man's approach to nature,
according to Sittler, is the
interpretation of the doctrine
of dominium terri in terms
of domination of nature by
man. ®

He said that this interpre-
tation has been used as a
“heavenly apologia for Tex-
aco,” subverting its original
meaning: a charge to man to
take care of his sister, the
earth,

Sittler said that the impor-
tant question. that the theo-
logian must ask is: How can
the traditional view of man's
responsibility in caring for
the earth be restored?
