Science Students To Study
Subjects By Sound Movies

Chemistry, Physics Departments
Purchase Projector For Scien-
tific Films

Professor O. J. Thies of the Chemis-
try department has announced the pur-
chase of an R.C.A. portable projection
machine to be used by the combined
Physics and Chemistry departments as a
method of instruction and to illustrate
some of the practical applications of
these sciences, °

This projector is fitted for the show-
ing of standard 35-millimeter films. It
is complete with up-to-date sound equip-
ment that works by means of a photo-
electric cell, which picks up sound track
of film. Its 1000-watt projection lamp
furnishes brilliant iHumination.

Last Thursday night the machine was
demonstrated by the purchasing com-
mittee and it proved satisfactory in every
respect. The lens are of such nature
that a clear focus can be obtained at
any reasonable distance.

It is the plan of the science department
to borrow some of the educational films
that are available at the present time.
General Electric Co., The Bureau of
Mines, and several other agencies put
out a number of these films, which can
be secured by payment of the trans-
portation charges only. The Chemistry
department has in mind as its first pic-
ture, General Electric’s “Arrangement of
Atoms in Molecules.” The Chemistry
lecture hall will be adaptéd for a pro-
jection room and due to its limited seat-
ing capacity the pictures can be wit-
nessed only by students of the science de-
partments.

The machine was purchased for the
exclusive use of the Physics and Chem-
istry departments but the two depart-
ments plan to set up a nominal rental fee
by which other departments may secure
its services. In the near future an op
erator will be appointed and a set of
rules governing the use of the machine
will be drawn up.

Young Accompanist
Praised By Critics

Miss Southwick Obtains Success
In Recent Concert In
Greensboro

Those members of the Davidson stu-
dent body who were fortunate enough
to hear the piano program given last
spring in chapel by Miss Sue Kyle
Southwick will be interested to hear of
her brilliant success as accompanist for
Luigi Boccelli, blind tenor, in a recent
concert in Greensboro,

Miss Southwick is a member of Wom-
an’s College faculty, and is quite well
known throughout this section of the
country for her outstanding ability as
a pianist. x

In addition to her masterful accom-
paniments, Miss Southwick also played
the “Aeolian Harp” étude, by Chopin,
and the “Concert Waltz,’ by Delibes-
Dohananye on the Greensboro program.
Quoting the Greensboro paper: “Adding
immensely to the beauty of the concert
was the sympathy of the accompanist,
Miss Sue Kyle Southwick, pianist, of
the music faculty of Woman’s College,
whose understanding was lasting during
the entire concert.”

Luigi Boccelli, featured singer on the
program, has been hailed as “the second
Caruso,” and judging from comments
on the program in Greensboro, well
deserves the appellation. Mr. Boccelli
gave a program of well-known classics
to an audience numbering several hun-
dred.

The distinction of being chosen accom-
panist for a singer of Mr. Boccelli’s
ability bespeaks in itself Miss South-
wick’s extraordinary excellence at the
piano.

Mrs. W; O. Sample and her daughter,
Bessie, are spending several weeks with
relatives in. Roxboro.

Hand And Potter Will End

Grid Careers

“TUBBY” HAND

C. H. “Tubby” Hand, huge Wildcat
guard, will be.among those seniors who
climax their college gridiron careers
Thanksgiving against the Wake Forest
Deacons.

Hand’s career reflects a great deal of
glory on him for his _ outstanding
achievements in strengthening the light
Davidson line. His consistent hard fight-
ing has done much to bolster the team’s
spirits. His ~play has attracted the at-
tention and praise of many of David-
son’s opponents.

“Tubby” has played football during
his entire four years in college and
is one of the few Wildcats. who have
won their letter in their Sophomore
year. In high school he was a regular
at the fullback position. \He played
tackle for his first three years at Dav-
idson and this year he has been shifted
to running guard. Hand weighed 268
pounds when he, entered college and lost
10 pounds during the first day’s practice.
He still tips the scales at the same
weight that he registered on his second
day of freshman football—258 pounds.
In spite of his monstrous size “Tubby”
is incredibly fast. He has also taken
part in wrestling and has proven his
strength and skill in this sport.

Football is Hand’s favorite sport as
you might well imagine. He has also
secured a service letter in mathematics.
According to “Tubby” his favorite pas-
time is “beating on his roommate, Knox
Thompson.”

In regard to the approaching game,
“Tubby”. believes “that Wake Forest
will give us a good fight but we ought
to beat them. We have had a pretty
unsuccessful season this year, but most
of our reverses can be blamed on our

In Wake Game

A. J. POTTER

A. J. Potter, varsity, guard, will play
his last football game for the Red and
Black next Thursday when the Wildcats
meet the Deacons on Richardson Field.
Potter has been a reliable and hard tight-
ing player since he first walked on the
field in his freshman year. He was elect-
ed captain of the yearlings and the fol-
lowing year he won his letter in his first
season of varsity cmpetition.

In-addition to his prowess on the grid-
jron, Potter has made an enviable rec-
ord in other campus activities. He has
won his letter in wrestling, is a member
of the track squad, major of the R.O.T.C,
battalion, president of the student body
ciation and vice-president of student body
.in his junior year.

Potter belongs to several honorary fra-
ternities including O.D.K., Sigma Delta
Psi, Scabbard and Blade, and the D
Club. His favorite sport has always
been football, with track running a close
second.

In regard to the coming ‘Wake Forest
game Potter says, “I think we will win
alright. The spirit for this game has
been above par and we'll all be doing
our best. I hope that Mackorell will be
able to play against Wake Forest. 1
would rather have Mackorell on my team
than anybody I’ve played against. He
is a great leadér and a great player.”

Your reporter, then switched the dis-
cussion to a review of the past season.
The conversation reveals that Potter con-
siders “Army is the best team we have
played against. Barclay of North Caro-
lina has impressed me as being the smart-
est guard that I've seen this year. We
have run up against some mighty tough
opposition and have really been playing
teams out of our class most of the time.

“Among the
_ GREEKS

The past week-end has not seen a great |.

deal of activity on fraternity court.
Since there was nothing of special in-
terest going on here on the hill, quite
a few of the Greeks took this as a good
week-end to make a few long-promised
excursions around North Carolina and
the adjoining states.

Apparently those who remained here
turned their interests in other directions
than fraternity houses. In spite of the
lack of much activity a few items of in-
terest were gathered from the members.

Beta Theta Pi—The brothers enjoyed
a feed at the house Sunday night. Broth-
er Ward of the mother chapter of the
fraternity at Miami University was a
guest of the week-enda

Pi Kappa Alpha—The chapter enter-
tained with an informal on Sattirday
night featuring a nameless playlet given
by the pledges. This was the second
of a series of informals planned by the
chapter for this year. Following — the
play refreshments were served to the
members of the chapter and the follow-
ing guests:

Isabel White, Marian Cannon, “Baby”
Hoover, Gertrude Ross, Alice Cline,
Caddie Willis, Coralie Means, and
Francis Gibson of Concord; Ann Pur-
nell, Peggy Jones, Mary McBrayer,
Bonnye Cox, Martha Pettiway, and
Mary Durden, of Charlotte; Nelly Me-
Cubbins and Brownie, Rendleman, of
Salisbury; Frances Stough of Cornelius;
Jennie Thompson, of Davidson; James
Towery, Parks Lafferty, Jr., and Julius
Fisher, of Concord.

Kappa Alpha—After the usual Sun-
day evening feed the brothers of Sigma
chapter held a sing. This feed and get
together was enjoyed by all.

Sigma Alpha- Epsilon — Among the
travelers in the Theta chapter were La-
mont Brown, Harris Barkeedle and
Henry Eve, who were attracted to At-
lanta; Archie Shuford and George Ma-
this spent the week-end in Durham; and
Yates Faison and Billy Merchant went
to Raleigh. 3

Kappa Signa — The brothers were
present in large numbers at a feed Sun-
day night. The chapter is expecting
a number of visitors for the Thanks-
giving Day game, and are planning to
have a big day Thursday in their honor.

Pi Kappa Phi—The brothers of Ep-
silon are planning a~Phanksgiving party
to be given at the house on Thursday
night. Many girls have been invited
and a number of alumni brothers are
expected. Brother Everett Otey, pres-
ent head of the chapter, was operated
on early in the week for appendicitis.

Phi GammgDelta—The guest of hon-
or for the Fiji's his week was brother
Sam Nickey of Memphis, a graduate of
the class of °34. An unusually large
crowd attended the feed Sunday eve-
ning. Visitors during the day were:
Ralph Olson of Hartford, Conn.; and
Wayne Varnell of Cleveland, Tenn.,
both students at Emory and Henry, /At
a recent chapter meeting the brothers
decided to have a dinner between the
two Saturday dances of Sophomore
Week-End, and they have engaged the
S. and W. for the occasion.

Phi Delta Theta — The brothers of
Gamma chapter held their usual Sunday
night feed, but aside from this they
do not report any other chapter ac-
tivities.

Sigma Phi Epsilon — This chapter
spent a quiet week-end; however, most
of the brothers were present at the
weekly feed at the house Sunday eve-
ning.

“In regard to school spirit, I think
it has fallen quite a bit since my fresh-
man year but seems to be rising again
this year. The student body has backed
the team unusually wefl this year and
the freshman cheering section has been
good.” 5

IVEY-GRAM

ENTIRELY FORMAL
When the college man is making prep-
arations to attend formal affairs the
most exacting care for correct dress
must be exercised. For the truly formal

occasion he must wear the full-dress
tailcoat and not the “formal” dinner
jacket. It has been the custom for a

long time in various institutions that the
tuxedo is the correct dress for formal
functions. Fashion experts bave de-
creed that it is only to be worn at the
formal dinner and that “tails”

worn to formal dances.
BLACKER THAN BLACK

One of the latest innovations in eve-
ning clothes has come to us from Lon-
don. The new tailcoat is of fine basket-
weave fabric, in midnight blue instead
of the conventional black. Under artiti-
cial light it looks blacker than black
itself which has a tendency to look green-
ish under the bright lights of the eve-
ning. The stubby short lapels are ex-
tremely wide and are faced with a dull
ribbed silk grosgrain and the coat sleeves
have false cuffs.
A fine white lin-
en. shirt which
carries two
white pearl
studs should be
worn, as well
as a white
Waistcoat. The
latest design in
formal vests has no back and pointed
ends,

are to be’

The lapels are cut square across
the bottom, giving a “broadening” ef-
fect which is new and modern, ‘The vest
may be either single-breasted or double-
breasted but if the former, then black
buttons should be worn on it. One of
the distinguishing features of this new
tailcoat the an
breastpocket.

MORE WING-SPREAD
The days of the narrow, cutting wing
collars seem to be passing speedily be-

is absence of outside

cause all the latest designs in
weiring apparel are bringing in a collar
with more: wing-spread that should prove

much more comfortable. The collar
shown in the inset is one of the latest
aes and most authentic of
the new styles. A white

pique bow which is of
semi-butterfly shape and
tied with a small knot
makes this new collar look extremely
modernistic. Both of these articles may
be secured at JIHY’S as well the
white vest and midnight blue tails men-

as

tioned above.
ACCESSORIES

Care should be taken in the purchase
of accessories to select only those that
are ultra-modern in design.  /VHY’S
are showing apparel jewelry styled by
Hickock at very reasonable prices. These
sets, for evening wear, include cuff-links,

studs, and vest buttons. Another im-
portant article which adds just that nee-
essary dash and finesse to “tails” is a

red carnation worn as a boutonnier, As
yet this has not attained such great
popularity in the south but before the
winter season is over the red carnation
will be an indispensable part of your
formal outfit.
