WE'VE HEARD—and written—enough about how |
the loss of Charlie Benson has put the Davidson College |
football team on the shelf as far as this season goes.

There is not much doubt that Benson is, or was, the
most valuable player on this year’s team, which had the,
potential to be as good as any we've had here in the past
three or four years.

But Benson is only one man, and he would be the
first to protest that the ‘Cats are not a one-man team.
We think that the players realize that too. We don’t
think that they’ve called it a season with five games
left on the schedule.

BIG CHARLIE won’t play against V.M.L. tomorrow
and he'll be doing well to dress out for the Nomeconing:
game. He won’t be at full strength this year.

The load rests squarely on the shoulders of Tee
Redding and Duncan Morton. You won‘t see the op-
tion run much against V.M.I. because Redding can’t
run and Morton can‘t pass. This is bad because the
bread-and-butter play for the Cat’s has always been
the option.

It will be sorta strange to watch a Davidson team
struggle along without a good, ,all-around quarterback.
Dick Belton and Dyke Little held the fort for three years
up until 1957. When things looked bad then, one Char-,

lie Benson came along and pulled the ’Cats up by their,

boot straps.

The time is ripe for another saviour. No one really
expected Benson, who was merely a left-handed half-
back to become one of the best quarterbacks ever to
run a Davidson team.

THE SAVIOUR is not likely to come in the form of
Tee Redding, who can’t run, or in Duncan Morton, who
can’t pass—but then it wasn’t likely to come in the form
of a left-handed halfback.

We hope that Hart wifi take care of the short
yardage, that Sheffield or McRorie can break loose,
that Anderson, Crute, Porter, Bynum, Clark and all
the rest will do their jobs a little better than usual—
that they’ll forget that the most valuable player on
the team is sitting on the bench wearing a sport coat
instead of shoulder pads.

We hope that the team, without Benson, without
the option play, will save jtself.

. it sounds a little corny, but heck, it might

THE NEWEST light on ‘the Davidson sports horizon,

is a group known simply as The R.O.T.C. Bowling Team.
Operating mainly on elbow grease and horse liniment,
the military has only been able to achieve its mission
twice in five encounters with the enemy.

Making up the detail are Sgt. Gregory, team cuptiisi:
Sgt. McCurry, Sgt. Pendley, Sgt. Crump, Specialist Wil-
lie Hubbard and Col. Adams.

Considering the battle conditions, this dauntless sex-
tet has been fortunate to win two matches in the Moores-
ville League, their theatre of operations—for only two
members of the team had. bowled before this year.

The ‘Cats, looking for their Richmond 14-14 in their

conference win, will
throw an adjusted offense
against the Keydets. This
change was forced by the loss
of ace quarterback Charlie
Benson in Davidson's first
Virginia outing against Rich-
mond two weeks ago. The
new offense will be built
around the capabilities of
Benson's replacements, Tee
Redding and Duncan Morton.

that the possibility of a win
over Duke will depend on
the answers to two questions:
(1) Can the ‘Cats play against
the Blue Devils as they did
in the third quarter against
Pfeiffer earlier this week
(when they scored three
goals)? (2) Can the team con-
tinue to hold major injuries
to a minimum?

“Duke has the advantage of
playing on its home field, but
our boys definitely have the
desire to win,” Marrotte added.
The ‘Cats are now riding a four
game winning streak and a win
over ACC member Duke would
add to Davidson's. prestige.

Duke's style of play is dif-
ferent from Davidson's ‘ in
that the center halfback
plays on offense, instead of
defense. The Duke  sfyle,
therefore, lends itself to fast-
breaking by the wings.

Last Monday, the head-and-

5-0, with Tom Bruns ‘scoring
the first goal early in the
game. After. that, Pfeiffer ral-
lied and the ‘Cats had a let-
down, the first half ending
10. The second half was a
different story. The Wildcats
came back strong, scoring

three goals in the third quart-
er, two coming within less
than a minute of play.

Mike Laughlin scored the
first of these, with Glyn
Hughes punching through the
second. Laughlin then wot the

Tom Scott as basketball practice moved into its

week

Prospective _ Wildcat  cagers
began workouts Oct. 15. Coach
Scott tended’ to pass over the
loss of last year’s seniors. “Of
course we'll miss them, but we
have better depth this year.
Practically. all positions are
wide open, and it's too early
Ito tell who will fill them:”

SPIRIT, DEPTH

|}: Scott continually — talked
about the spirit of this year’s
squad. He also pointed out the
|'Cats will have more .speed, ¢
pecially at the guard positions,
|and indicated that he intended
ito take full advantage of it.
| “With the depth we have. this
iyear we'll be able to substitute
much more frecly than last
year.

“We'll use all kinds of de-
fenses, depending on the play-
ers who are in the game. When
players whose main value is on
offense are in, we will be more
likely to use the zone. With
others we can play man-to-man.
‘We should have a defense ready
ifor ev ry situation.”

SAME OFFENSE

Scott indicated that the of-
fense would be similar to last
year’s. “Of course you try to
get the best men open. I ex-
|pect our guards to add the real
impact to our offense.”

The two biggest question
marks, according to Scott, are
Jim Nuckol’s: and Ronnie An-

through, he, Joe Markee, and
Bob Moore may be able to han-

ing Eddie Stewart to move to

SHINN RETURNS
Scott was evidently counting
on high-scoring Bill Shinn for
one forward position, but ‘the
other berth seemed to be his
biggest worry. He. said that if

could use that height in there.
Also a lot depends on our sev-
en sophomores; last year they
werg the core of the best

freshman team in years.”

TOUGH SCHEDULE

Scott seemed pleased with
this year’s schedule. “We play
some of the top teams, and of
course, most people would give
us better than a fifty-fifty
chance of losing to Louisville.”
He noted that Tennessee and
Wake Forest would be real
challenges for the ‘Cats and
was pleased to have two games
with Clemson.

Scott gave evidence that he
was thinking less of going
down the. ladder in the South-
ern Conference than going up.

Looking at the season in gen-
eral, he said, “We should do
better this year, yes, I think
we will.”
