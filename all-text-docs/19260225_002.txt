FEBRUARY 25, 1926

One great regret of life for many people
will be the missing of the State-Carolina
cage game in Raleigh, in which the Techmen
held the Tar Heels to virtually a scoreless
half—at least but one point, and that a foul
shot.

Game Between Reds and
Blacks Results in Tie

After Bitter Struggle

Wells and Grey Star, But Neither is
Able to Penetrate Opposing
Defense

The first football game of the spring sea-
son last Saturday afternoon between the
Reds and the Blacks resulted in a scoreless
tie. Straight football was indulged in by’
practically both teams and thus failed to
provide the thrills hoped for by the spee-
tators. Only four varsity men were used
during the entire game, the subs being given
a chance to show their stuff.

Five Freshmen started off for the Blacks,
while the Reds used two only.

The -punting up to the second half was!
done by Leggette and McEachern, neither of
whom proved a shining light at the art. In
the last half both teams opened up with a
passing attack, the Blacks completing two
and the Reds three.

In the first quarter the Reds advanced the
ball into Black territory and with the aid of
Nesbit’s 20-yard dash, got within striking
distance the Black goal, but here the
Blacks stiffened and took the ball on downs.

The second period saw the Blacks wake up.
Kell snagged a 20-yard heave. Black slid
off tackle for two. Kell received a poor pass
from center and fumbled but recovered with-
out loss. Flinn then elected to pass, but W.
Black’s toss was incomplete. Then Flinn
ona fake kick smashed through the line, but
was downed on the 8-yard line. Leggette
kicked the Red out of danger. The half
ended with the Reds in possession of the ball
on their 5-yard line. :

Second Half

The Reds kicked off, and Grey, substituting
for Kell, ran the ball back ten yards. The
Blacks made first in ten and then were forced
to kick, The rest of the quarter passed
quietly except when Leggette busted right
tackle for ten yards.

The Reds started the last stanza off with
a snap. Wells received a long heave from
| Overton, putting the ball on the 10-yard line.
Overton fumbled and Riggs McConnell stop-
ped Wells for no gain. Overton then tried
ja place kick from the 22-yard line which
| barely missed going through the poles. Grey
| punted out of danger and Overton was down- |
jed in his tracks. Wells galloped through the
jline for about 20 yards. Overton threw a
| couple of passes to Wells for about six more
'and then lost the ball on downs. About this
time Coach Tex sent in a multitude of subs.
Grey tried a few passes which failed. He
then stepped through the line a bit and the
game ended with Overton breaking up an at-
tempted pass.

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

Buck Flowers, famous grid star of Da-
vidson and Georgia Tech, was instructed to
send scouts to North Carolina to look over
a trio. of football players. He did. The
{scouts came back. “They're three of the
best players anywhere in the South,” they
said. Weigh that: report for what it is
worth.

Two of the three players (we made refer-
ence a couple of weeks ago to them) want to
come to Davidson, What a recommendation
they would have if they came! Buck Flow-
ers also said there was no reason why Da-
vidson should not get them. Which sounds

interesting for at least some good players on:

the 1926 Freshman team, if they come. Like
many other men, their financial condition isn’t
the best in the world, but with initiative they
can get through Davidson largely working
their way through if they can tidy over the
first’ year.

Anyway, we would favor the borrowing of
money to come to a school like Davidson, be-
cause there is no gainsaying the fact that a

man’s respect is higher among his fellowmen |

if it is known that he is getting something

for something, and not getting something |

for nothing. When real life struggles be-
gin you won't have someone to hand over
several thousand and tell you to go to it.
Therefore, if a man learns what true econ-
omy is in college, nine times out of ten he
won't be the splurger and wishy-washy fel-
low that many people have come to regard
college graduates. 0

“Carolina wrestling team won the state
championship by the score of 19 to 13 over
the Duke mat team,” says the lead of a story
from Chapel Hill last Saturday night. This
immediately recalled the fact that glaring
headlines prematurely declared Wake Forest
the state grid champs after the first game of
the season. How anyone can honestly make
that declaration when many more mat
matches are to be held can not be under-
stood, Even if we knew absolutely that no
team could defeat Davidson we would not
declare we were state champions until the
last game or match had been completed.

While it is true that the Wildcat grap-|

plers do not meet Carolina this year, still we
do link up with Duke and State, and on a
comparative basis different conclusions may
be drawn. Such statements as that only
make teams work harder to disprove the
We certainly hope the
Davidson wrestlers will upset this uncalled-
for claim.

A local story appearing in The Observer
of Sunday says that the State grid team is
going to don white jerseys next season, and
that their tilt with the Wildcats are largely
responsible for this decision, The assertion
was made that “State blames her showing

partly responsible of the fact that both
teams were adorned in red jerseys.”

from a State man, but was largely a matter
of conjecture upon the part of the reporter
of that item. Can not Davidson properly
claim, upon the basis of the above assertion,
that the reason the Wildcats didn't pile up
a 30-0 score was because of the fact that
the red jerseys of the Techmen were re-
sponsible? -We do not claim anything like
that. The game was played and Davidson

‘Six Letter Men Report
‘For Practice on Diamond
Led by Captain Alford

|Many Promising Freshmen Try Out
For Berths on Varsity Squad

The first week of baseball practice is over
and with the beginning of the second week
more strenuous workouts and a tightening
down to a hard grind of practice has begun,
which will continue until the first game of
the year.

The first week of practice started off with
a rush under the supervision of Captain Al-
ford and besides the preliminary limbering-
up workouts, there was some real inficld and
batting practice indulged in by the players.

Coach Younger is still working with the
' basketball team, but practice in the spring
sport has been running smoothly under Cap-
tain Alford. The sore arms are beginning to
|get fewer and whereas some of the former
|heavy hitters were swinging wildly at the
| first batting practices, they are getting into
| form and the crack of the bats is again re-
sounding over Richardson Field with a re-
assuring crack,

Too Early

It is still early in the season to predict the
various chances of men playing certain po-,
sitions, The lineup that has been used more |
often by Coach-Captain Alford seems to be
developing into a real combination, He has
been working out behind the plate himself,
which position he will most likely play in
most of the games. Alford is a real hitter,
a steady catcher and should be able to better |
control his team from this position.

At the initial sack, Abe Kugler and Wood-
ham have been alternating, with Frank Al-|
ford also working out here at times. The
combination of John Kugler at second and
his brother Abe at short should work well. !
John played short on the Fresh team last
year but because of a slow peg to first he
has been shifted to second to fill the hole
left by the graduation of Simpson of last
year’s team.

At Short '

Abe Kugler is a steady fielder, has a good!
arm and he and Bobby Glenn will have a
royal battle for the  short-field

doubt be used against left-hand pitchers.
Johnny Dulin, of last year’s Freshmen, is
contending worthily against the elongated
Kimbrough, who is a utility man for third
base.

Picking an outfield will be a difficult mat-
ter for Coach Younger. No doubt Harry
