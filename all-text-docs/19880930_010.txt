Friday, September 30, 1988 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Wildcats win three matches -

By CHANDLER SHEPPARD

Led by the “Freshman Connection” of
Holt Hathaway and Mimi Plauche, the
Davidson Wildcats have played well as a
team, winning their last three matches and
improving their record to 6-6.

The Cats defeated Gardner-Webb Col-

lege last week in Boiling Springs and re-
turned home to defeat Coastal Carolina and
Campbell University decisively.
. Hathaway and Plauche have become
almost .unstoppablé around the net.
Plauche has led the team in hitting the last
two games and has been counted on for the
almost automatic point or side out.

Against Coastal the Wildcats were in
total control. Despite losing the third
game, the Wildcats played well, emerging
with a 15-12, 15-3, 10-15, 15-6 victory.

The Wildcats were sparked in the fourth
game with strong hitting from senior
Lavetta Dawkins.

Davidson began to play up to their poten-
tial in the match against Campbell, de-
stroying them 15-13, 15-0, 15-4. The Cats
dominated the entire game with an all-out
team effort and strong defensive plays be
Maria Douglas and Christy Knight.

Hathaway used the entire net in setting to
teammates Dawkins, Plauche, Peggy Ti-
etgen, Ellen Ott, Douglas, and Molly
Graver.

Following a weekend tournament at
Wingate, the squad will be back home
Tuesday Oct. 4 with matches against Win-
gate and Queens College at 6:00: On Oct.
6, the Cats will take on Belmont Abbey in
Belmont. ~

Lady Cats drop third straight, are 2-4-1.

By LARRY DAGENHART,
JR.

Tuesday afternoon the
Davidson field hockey team lost
its third straight game to Pfeiffer
College, 4-1, dropping the team
record to 2-4-1.

The Wildcats began the game
rather tentatively but seemed like
they would gain control after-
wards. Unfortunately, the Cats
were forced to play more defense
than offense and never got control
of the game.

Fourteen ‘minutes into the
game, Pfeiffer scored the first
goal on a seven-yard penalty hit
which was awarded after
Davidson goalie Alison Chapman
grabbed the ball during a ground
scuffle and failed to drop it on the
same spot that her grab was made.

This penalty hit situation con-
sists of a one-on-one matchup
between a player and the goalie
and is very difficult to defend.

With 3:30 left in the first half,
Pfeiffer struck again with a goal
from Kelly Clatterbuck: and
Davidson’s deficit stood 2-0 at
halftime.

Thirteen minutes into the sec-

ond half, Gigi Cooke got the
Wildcats’ first goal on another
seven yard penalty hit, similar to
the situation in the first half.

‘At the 17:50 mark, just as the
Cats seemed to be getting fired up
and ready to.tie the score, Pfeif-
fer’s Greta Demchak scored on a
beautifully executed corner hit.
The ball slipped right between
Chapman and the near left corner
of the goal cage.

About a minute later, the Cats
all but letthe game get away as the
defense overcommitted, allowing
Clatterbuck her second goal of thé
game for the 4-1 final:

Saturday, September 24,
Davidson suffered a disappoint-
ing 2-0 loss at Catawba College.
Coach Betsy Pryor felt that the
problems were “something we
can fix. We had lots of offensive
pressure but weren’t consistent
enough.”

According to Pryor, mental
mistakes were made, like the
sweeper’s commitment at the
wrong time, leaving three players
charging the goal.

“We have the ability, but we’ ve
just been mentally out of our last
two games,” she said.

NOTES: The October 1 home
game against Methodist College
has been cancelled because Meth-
odist was unable to field a team
this year. Also, midfielder Ma-
jorie Havighurst is back in the
starting lineup after having recu-
perated from a sprained ankle.

' Field Hockey Thought of the
Week: What the heck is

After this receiver stops the ball
dead, she, or another player, can
shoot the ball toward the goal.
Some teams set up corner hits
by having one player near the
ground to “stick-stop” the ball by
placing the entire stick on the
ground with the flat end facing the
ball. Then they have another
player shoot the ball after the
stickstopper gets out of the way.
The team defending corner hits
can only have five of its players

a corner hit? This is a
penalty hit awarded to
the offensive team as a
result of a foul against
the defense inside the
16-yard (radius) circle in
front of the goal. This
situation provides a good
chance for a score.

The ball is placed on
the endline at a hash-
mark 10 yard to the side
of the goal. To begin the
play, a player hits the
ball toa teammate who is
standing outside the
boundary of the circle.

corner hit situation must be be-

If the player shooting the ball
toward the goal. takes a
backswing, the ball must hit the
18-inch high board that lies inside
the cage in order to count. If no
backswing is taken, the ball
counts as a goal wherever it lands-
-as long as it goes in the goal.
