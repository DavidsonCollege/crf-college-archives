Twelve Seniors Deliver
Fine Set | of Orations

Oratory Flows Freely as Seniors
Hold Audiences Spellbound.

Senior Speaking was revived with
the old-time pep last Friday night at
8:00 o’clock when:Dr. Shewmake
led six brave Seniors on the stage}
in Shearer Hall. After Dr. Arbuckle
had opened with prayer, the  elo-|
quence of Bitzer, Taylor and Knight,
combined with the flowing oratory
of Miller, Summers and Clark, held
the audience spellbound.

QUEENS COLLEGE PRESIDENT
TO SPEAK AT “Y” SUNDAY

Dr. A.-M. Fraser, president
Queens College, will speak at the!
local “Y” services next Sunday at}
|6:15. Dr. Fraser came to Queens}
last August and his progressive}
spirit has already made its impres-|
sion on both Queens and the city of|
|Charlotte. |

While at Belhaven College, in Mis-

ppi, Dr. Fraser made a reputa- |
tion throughout the South as a}
speaker and Christian worker. Since}
coming to Charlotte he has been}
much in demand, having addressed |

|

Ralston Bitzer, in pleading for re-
newed interest in literary societies, |
showed the various ways in which|
a student is educated by being an
active member of cither one of the

“ |
the Rotary Cluls, several churches
and other gatherings; also he has
entertained several picnic parties.

was the stellar event of one of the
most successful Senior weeks in the
history of the college.

The gymnasium was very. beau

of these colors. were strung from the
center of the room to each side!
while various pennants completed
the scheme of decoration, There}
Was a space set apart for the or-!
chestra in the middle of the floor. |
This space was enclosed by purple}

to give the effect of a band pavillion. |

punch bowls and immediately op-|
