FOUGHT IN CIVIL WAR

Ten Confederate Veterans Attend
Funeral Services at Ansonville

General W. A. SMITH, ’65, of An-
sonville, Davidson’s oldest alumnus,
died at his ancestral home in Anson-
yille on April 16. He was ninety-two
years old at the time of his death,
Death was attributed to a heart attack.

Funeral services were held at An-
sonville, and he was buried at Wades-
boro. Ten comrades of the North Car-
olina Department of the United Con-
federate Veterans, of which he was
commander, attended the funeral. The
casket was covered with the stars and
bars of the Confederacy.

General Smith ‘was born January 11,
1842, on the Nelms homestead near An-
sonville, After attending a local acad-
emy he entered Davidson College,
where he remained until shortly after
the ‘war broke owt. He then joined
the Anson Guards, a company raised
by Captain R. T. Hall, which was later
consolidated with the Buncombe Rough
and Ready Guards, captained by Zeb-
ulon Baird Vance, who later became
North Carolnia’s war governor.

He served with this company until
1862, when he was seriously wounded
in the Malvern Hill engagement. When
the war was over he found that the
family fortune had been swept away,
and so as a young man, in 1866, he
entered the mercantile business.

He later organized two cotton mills,
and then retired to his farm near An-
sonville. He was quite active in the
organization of the United Confeder-
ate Veterans, having been commander
of the Anson camp of the organization,
inspector-general of the second brigade
of North Carolina, and later command-
er of the North Carolina Department.

He is survived by his widow, Mrs.
Nannie Flake Smith.
