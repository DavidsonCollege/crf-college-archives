EDUCATION

(By Dr. Henry Louis Smith, of
Washington and Lee University)

A young American educating himself
for future success in the complex civili-
zation of today has ten times as many
learned “professions” open to him as the
college student of fifty years ago, and the
rewards of conspicious leadership in any
one of them are more dazzling than the
rosiest dreams of the college students of
that far-off age.

Industry, commerce, manufacturing,
transportation, inter-communication have
all advanced with giant strides and all
offer most attractive careers to the able
and ambitious.

Yet of all the nation-wide epidemics
of contagious development that have
swept our republic nothing in American
history has approached the amazing de-
velopment of American Education since
the new century began. Never has Ameri-
ca invested so many millions and billions
in schools of every kind from the kinder-
garten to the university. Never has any
civilized nation attempted or even ima-
gined the enrollment of so many millions
in regular liome-study, in summer schools
of every type, and in correspondence

schools covering the whole nation.

Never have the professional teachers of
America or of any nation been so thor-
oughly organized, so aggresive, enthus-
iastic and influential, as the teaching pro-
fession of America today. Within
the past ten years the average salary of
the average teacher has been more than
doubled, while the remuneration of city
superintendents and institutional presi-
dents now often exceeds the salaries of
governors, judges, senators, and even U.
S. ambassadors.

is

American public opinion, so often shal-
low, warped, and misled, is slowly turn-
ing from its ancient childish idolatry of
the soldier, the politician, and the million-
aire to a deeper appreciation ‘of the crea-
tive power and the social and civic in-
fluence‘of the Teacher. In the wiser and
happier America of Tomorrow there is
no doubt in my mind that the City Su-
perintendent of Education who mauylds
and creates the citizenship of the future
will far outrank in public opinion the ma-
yor, the railroad president, and the mil-
lionaire money-lender.

“If, therefore, you are so fortunate as
to possess brains, character, personal mag-
netism, and ample steam-power, you will
find in American Education a fruitful field
of creative labor, open doors of opport-
unity, and steadily increasing rewards for
conspicious success.

J. T. CHRISTENBURY

Eight Men Receive Letters For
Service in Wrestling

At a meeting of the wrestling team
Tuesday John B. Christenbury was
chosen captain of the team for the
coming season. The manager has not

team are T. E. Hill, former captain,

Thad Brock; G. E. Herriott; W. H.

bury had already won their letters in
previous years, while Brock, Warren,
Marrow and Cowan were issued their
“D” for the first time in wrestling.
Captain-elect Christenbury, a mem-
ber of the junior class, is from Stony
Point, N. C. Winning his numeral in
wrestling on the freshman team his
first year, he has shown improvement
since then and figured in many of the
fresh and varsity victory, recovering
his varsity “D” his second year, Dur-
ing the past season Christenbury has
proved a mainstay on the team and it
expected that the coming season
will be a success under his leadership.

The Scriptural basis for the talk was
taken from Daniel 1:8: “Daniel. pur-
posed in his heart” that he would not
conform to the standard of morality and
life of the foreign court. Daniel, a prince
of the house of Judah, resolved to endure
slavery rather than forsake principles of
character which had been his since early
youth.

But Daniel, a man with a preat—brain
as well as a great firmness of purpose,
was not destined to sink to obscurity; on
the other hand, he became a leader of
the empire, and performed a great work.
Of may not
result in temporal power, but the latter
is not the ultimate consideration.

In studying the life of Daniel, there
