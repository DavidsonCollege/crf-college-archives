October promises
to be Artsy

By Tammy Tiska

The fall semster continues to
offer a wide variety of cultural
events. A few of this coming
month’s highlights include a
Davidson presentation of Richard
Wilbur’ s translation of the Moliere
comedy The Learned Ladies. The
show opens on Tuesday, October
18 at 8 p.m. in Hodson Hall and
runs through Saturday, October 22.

The music department is also
hosting some intersesting perfor-
mances. On Tuesday, October 25,
Vivian Montgomery, prize-win-
ning harpsichordist, will play in
the Visual Arts Center atrium at 8
p.m. Her music includes a piece by

her husband, composer John

Morrison ‘79.
The Orion String Quartet will

perform on November 7 and Phil
Hoffard, pianist, will be at Hodson
Hall on November 13.

Some upcoming speakers will
include Kev Kedem: on ‘Sunday,
October 30. Kedem was involved
in the filming of Steven Speilberg’s
movie Schindler’s List. On Thurs-
day, November 3, visiting writer
Susan Ludvigson will read from
her poetry at 7:30 in the Big Screen
Room.

The Visual Arts Center will
continue to host the Daniel

Sutherland exhibition “Resulting -

Empty Wish” and sculpture by
Glenn Dasher until November 18
when the Dale Kennington Exhi-
bition “Time and Place” opens in
the Edward M. Smith Gallery.

would agree. This album epito-
mizes one of the traits that Mr.
Moss himself attributes to poor
songwriting, namely the “verse-
chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-
chorus” format. Such challenging
song structure provides the band
members with the opportunity to
display their tremendous instru-

mental skill—an opportunity

unafforded by their most recent
album or by side projects like the
Ju Ju Hounds.

Mr. Moss closes his article
with the dubious assertion that
Appetite (in 1987) managed to
overthrow techno—a genre that
emerged in the early Nineties—
while influencing “the grunge
movement.” The term “grunge” is
itself a misnomer applied by the
media to any number of bands
which have little in common save

perhaps their style of clothing, geo-

graphic location (mainly Seattle), :

and use of distorted guitars.
Perhaps bands such as Pearl
Jam and Nirvana could be said to
borrow their spirit from the punk
rock movement and their musical
style from hard rock pioneers like

Led Zeppelin. It can be said with ©

much more certainty, however, that
their music reacts against the sort
of bombastic, primordial cock-rock
which G-n-R helped to popularize.

Perhaps the article might have
been more appropriately titled “My
personal favorite Rock albums,”
as opposed to “Best Rock albums
ever.” In the future, I would hope
that such subjective, unsubstanti-
ated criticism could at least be re-
served for a somewhat more ap-
propriate section of the newspa-
per, namely the Opinions section.

The Harmony Committee, |

the group responsible for planning the orientation book
discussion for the last three years, seeks suggestions for
next year's orientation activity. While most responses to —
the orientation book discussion have been enthusiasti-
cally positive, and the committee continues to welcome
suggestions for new novels, the committee also plans to
explore the possibilities of engaging incoming students
with a different kind of "text" (a play, a poem, essays,
film, visual arts, music, etc.) and in a different format
(participatory readings, dramatic presentation, writing

The Committee seeks suggestions and ideas from
all members of the college community, especially past
orientation participants and discussion leaders. All sub-
missions should present in no more than one page a de-
scription or summary of the text, how it might be pre-
sented or discussed, and a brief rationale for why this
text and method of interpretation and engagement would
work well for Davidson's orientation.

In the past, The Harmony Committee has under-
taken the orientation book discussion project with two
goals in mind: first, to welcome incoming Davidson stu-
dents-to "the life of the mind" at Davidson College, and
second, to encourage these new students not only to ac-
knowledge issues of power (in some of its many forms),
but to discuss and challenge them as well, in art and in
