Freddie Frosh says a fast night
maketh a slow day.

Congratulations to Carolina and

The Daily Tar Heel.

Most professors think they are
entitled to life, liberty, and the Pas

¢

suit of a golf ball. '

Where's the woman who having
had the last word isn’t just dying
to know what you are thinking
about ?

Just now it’s perfectly in order
to keep on praising and backing that
Wildcat bunch more than ever.

And the chance to win a five spot
will be gone after mid-night tonight
when the Delta Pi Kappa writing
coritest closes.

These seniors ought to back up
the Faculty now and do everything
they can to put this big week-end
show over as the feature entertain-
ment of the year. Watching you

FI-YO! FI-YO!

.
Resolutions recently passed un-
animously by the Senior Class in
which the common practice of whist-
ling, shouting, and cries of “Fire,”
“Fi-yo” and whatnot directed to-
ward visitors, and especially young
lady visitors, to the campus were
classed as being improper and alto-
gether unnecessary.

This custom of making unseem-
ly- noises when a boy escorts his
Girl Friend to a basketball game or
into the dining hall or anywhere on
the campus is embarrasing to both,
as well as being extremely discour-
teous to the visitor. Not only has
this barbaric manner been in evi-
dence regarding girls but lately
there has been some tendency ’to hiss
and boo at players at basketball
games—altogether new and out of
line with the conduct of Davidson-
ians of days past. Surely this must
be from a very few unthoughtful
ones and not representative of the
spirit of the mass.

The seniors have pledged to a
man to discontinue any such ungen-
tlemanly conduct, if any had prac-
ticed it before, and to use their in-
fluence to control and elminate the
tendency in the student body. Where

"are the other classes standing on the
proposition ?

Let’s throw this prep-schoolish
practice out because that’s not the
Davidson spirit, men.

the incorrect way that all will not
be well for those who follow.
President Wilbur of Stanford
University has this to say:

“The fact that a higher percent-
age of students is succeeding in the
University than ever before means
that our student body is more stable.
The floater, the idler, the drifter,
the bounder, and the boozer, are
running a shorter course each year.
Ninety per cent of our students are
attertding to their: business and suc-
ceeding with their work. A cer-
tain proportion of the time of these
is needed to keep the five or ten
per cent from making a nuisance of
themselves and to keep them from
hurting the good name of the Uni-
versity;

“Personally, | have fullest confi-

.|dence in our present group of stud-

ents. They are going ahead, chas-
ing some false gods, no doubt, but
on the whole, looking each situation
in the face, analyzing its strength
and its weakness, and making the
necessary decisions as to what they
shall do or not do. The great ma-
jority of them are acquiring those
steady habits of work which form
the basis of success and satisfaction
in life. The world forgives a great
deal in the man who is a worker and
who contributes to the general wel-
fare. The University overlooks
much when its work is well done
and when there is evidence that the
student is advancing and growing.’
Learning to live. ‘Advancing
and growing.” ‘Acquiring steady
habits of work ...” Thus does
President Wilbur indicate the true
education as he sees it—not only
‘n learning but in the practical use
of what one learns is there gained
success according to present stand-
ards. i)

THE BUILDING PROGRAM

As the dome of Chambers Build-
ing nears completion our thoughts
turn to the progress which the phy-
sical plant of Davidson College has
made in the past few years. The
students who are now in college
have been here during a period of
development which surpasses any
which the college has experienced
in many years. Of the classes which
will see more development the junior
and senior stand highest with the
junior class probably witnessing
more material additions to the col-
leg than any other.

It is the only class which will have
cbserved the ¢ompletion of the sta-
dium, the addition of the new tennis
courts, the building of Fraternity
Court, Chambers fully functioning,
and the changes which will probably
be made by the coming meeting of
the Board of Trustees in the uses of
Shearer Hall, the Armory, the “Y”
Halls and the Temporary, The al-
terations which the Board will make
in the functions of these buildings
is anticipated with interest.

One is almost tempted to look for-
ward to the completion of a build-
ing program,—a time when the col-
lege authorties can turn their at-
tention more fully to other lines of
development.
sideration

But on second con-
such a time does not
prove to be immanent. There are
more things todo. There is a dorm-
itory to be built to take the place
of Rumple, North, and South; there
is a new church to be built; there is
a vision of a swimming pool and a
“tin can,”

Where progress reigns, comple-
tion can never exist.

STOP THE CHAM?

Should publication of the “Cham-
cleon” be discontinued at the close
of this scholastic year? This ques-
tion—brought to a head by the bril-
liantly devastating arraignment of
it by the mysterious reviewer of the
last issue—is being pondeted by
more than a few students at present.

After this first question resolves
itself into two: can the Magazine
be run on a satisfactory basis? And,

is the” dak worth” ‘Publishng ?

Einstein, the great German scientist,
has now elaborated a theory identifying
gravitation with electrodynamic magne-
tism. In Minneapolis it is said that this
theory is something like love. No one
else can understand it.

At last a use for old razor blades has
been discovered. N. A. Zeigler of Pitts-
burgh has devised a method of getting
gas from steel and iron by ‘the use of
a high-frequency induction vacuum furn-
ace. The gas thus derived may be used
for gas stoves and possibly for automo-
biles. If} such a process should be put
into operation successfully, old razor
blades in the future will be hoarded to
furnish gas for trips to Charlotte and

| elsewhere.

A week ago last Sunday was the fifth
anniversary of the death of Woodrow
Wilson. One single wreath of jonquils
was received in memory of the great
man. However, such neglect of the oc-
casion is not quite so bad as it seems
when we consider’ that few men are re-
membered for their death, but rather for
their birth, as illustrated clearly by De-
cember 25 and February 22.

The famed White House electric horse
of the Coolidge regime was last week
crated for shipment to Northampton. The
President-elect seems to prefer steam-
ship fishing excursions to ‘indoor horse-
manship.

There were in India last year about
5,000 deaths from poisonous snake bites
as compared with 27 in the United States.
This large number of unnecessary deaths
could be cut down considerably by edu-
cating the people to steps to take after
being bitten. The principle things to do
are first to apply a tourniquet, then identi-
fy the kind of snake that caused the in-
conveniences and obtain a serum for it as
quickly as possible. If properly cared
for cure may be effected if the serum is
injected with twenty-four hours.

The Communist party, which is now
the official party of Soviet Russia, re-
cently arrested 150 followers of the now
exiled Leon Trotsky on the ground that
they were preparing to make war on the
government. Russia seems to be one
of the several countries which are now
undergoing major revolutions. But when
they finally get settled the Russians will
probably soon show themselves to be a
world power of no small importance.

Among the bills passed by Congress
one provides for the appropriation of

With the Charlotte merchants
agreeing as a body to advertise in
no school publications other than
year hooks, coupled to the honor of
being part host to the State Press
Association the present -staff has
undoubtedly had the hardest finan-
cial year in the existence of the mag-
azine. And yet the business mana-
ger hopes—atter publishing the
third and last issue—to end the year
completely out of debt.

To answer the second question
we must generalize a bit. College's
only excuse for existence is Learn-
ing. And only the few learn before
many trials. Every student body al-
ways contains some few who like
the idea of writing, either vaguely
or definitely, And the college mag-
azine is the sole outlet to such an
impulse; or impulse to such a lik-
ing,

But, the fatal question comes, do
students ever read the Magazine—
even when alone? And this of
course can never be answered defin-
itely. Having made a few inquiries
here and there, we believe that
enough of the body reads it to war-
rant the continuance of the ‘““Chame-
leon.” It may influence your opin-
ion to recall how many times you
have heard it said that the last re-
view of the magazine was too harsh.

If the Magazine is to be continu-
ed, certainly it must femain in its
present form rather than become a
supplementary edition of The Dav-
idsonian, Conditions probably war-
ranted such a change at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina; but it would
not be feasible at Davidson, for al-
most obvious reasons.

The time has come, in the poinion of
President Lowell of Harvard, when the
whole question of prohibition should be
reopened. He thinks that the established
facts, as known to moderate and sensible
man, call for a change of public policy
without prohibition. President Lowell
does not condone defiant and flaunting
violations of the law. But, in the Febru-
ary Atlantic, he writes words of truth
and soberness when he declares that “if
the prohibitionists insist that their prin-
ciple unabated shall remain the formal
law they will probably make enforcement
impossible, hamper the growth of tem-
perance and perpetuate violation of the
law and of good order. This last is the
most serious aspect of the matter.”

Man must face the fact that, while the
human species stands at the top of life
by virute only of its intelligence, the in-
sects stand at the top of a divergent race
far older, far better fitted for existence,
and endowed with what is called instinct
of the highest degree. For instance, a
single cabbage aphis, an insect weighing
litte more than a milligram, might have
in a year so many descendants that the
ponderous mass of the whole would weigh
more than 1,644,000,000,000 pounds. Esti-
mating the human population of the world
at 2,000,000,000 and the average weight
at the exaggerated figure of 150 pounds,
we have as the total of human weight
300,000,000,000 pounds. In other words,
the plant-lice descended from one in-
dividual of one species in one season
would weigh more than five times as
much as all the people of the world.
It is obvious that the intelligent type
will dominate eventually, but it is also
obvious that it will dominate only through
its intelligence.

Aleading journal has collected un-
conscious wit from eollege examination
papers. Several specimens deserve to
be reprinted. “Sir W. Scott was called
the Blizzard of the North. He tried to
reach the North Pole, but died in the at-
tempt.” A keen interest in politics is
shown by the statement that “Congress
assembled in November and dissembled
in December.” Asked to explain the use
of the imperfect tense in French, one
wrote that it is employed “to express
a future action in past time which does
not take place at all.” Asked to turn
into English, “Notre voisin est mort
d'une congestion pulmonaire,” be neatly
rendered it, “Our neighor died of a crush
in a Pullman car.” And another one
was, “What do you understand by the
Theory of Exchange? The Theory of
Exchange, as I understand it, is not very
well understood.”

Soph: “You want to keep your eyes
open around here today.”

Frosh: “Why?”

Soph: “Because people would think

you are crazy if you went around with
them shut.”

READY TO BATTLE
To the Editor:

What hot Boxers, and other pugilis-
tic expressions! The Senior Class is
rough-ready and rearing to go. Five
of the “hard boys” who will fight for
the honor of ’29 have had extensive, and
in each case successful, experience in the
amateur ring. Their identity will not
be dislocated until the evening of the big
fight. They are all fast, merciless, dark
horses and we marvel at the timerity
evidenced by the other classes in their
willingness to engage in fistic combat
with the boys of ’29.

But this is no extraordinary situation.
Should it not be so? Have not the boys
of '29 toiled through four long years of
college whatnot? Yea, even so. They
are without a doubt matured to a sur-
passing extent physically, mentally and
morally, over the underclassmen.

Therefore, Beware! There shall be
great weeping and wailing and gnashing
of teeth by the boys of '30, ’31, and ’32.

Editor’s Note. This letter comes in
answer to an editorial published last
week in which the practice of shouting
at opposing players in the act of shoot-
ing goals was questioned as to its fair-
ness to the opposition, its g oo d
sportsmanship; -and—its general prac-
tice. There was no intention of hold-
ing up either the team or the coaches
to criticism but merely to receive a
reply such as the following one which
might clarify the spirit of the ractice
for ‘ous kers at recent
games.

A VINDICATION
To the Editor:
Justice to our coaches and ‘basketball

e .
_|teams demands that an editorial printed

on this page last week be challenged
as unfair and incorrect. In this article
which appeared under the caption “Queer
Tactics,” the writer expressed regret
that our basketball teams have adopted
“the seemingly unsportsmanlike tactics”
of shouting at opposing players when they
are attempting to ring goals from the
field. This practice was decried as un-
fair to the opposition and as out of ac-
cord with the Daavidson code.

Though made with the best intent and
in a fine spirit of loyalty to those high
principles of sportsmanship of which Dav-
idson is so justly proud, this criticism
exhibits a considerable misunderstand-
ing of basketball tactics and methods of
coaching. It is my purpose in this article
to attempt to correct such mistaken ideas
and to remove from the mind of the wri-
ter of the editorial any of any others
who may be laboring under the same mis-
apprehensions all doubts concerning the
sportsmanship of the tactics employed
by our basketball teams.

No one thinks of suggesting that it is
unfair to the opposition for a player’ to
slap the ball from the hands of a man
who is in the act of shooting at the bas-
ket; undoubtedly this is very discon-
certing and inconvenient for the player
attempting to score the two points, but
it is accepted by all as fair, as sports-
manlike, as a natural and sane’ method
of defense. Though to the minds of
those unfamiliar with the game of bas-
ketball there may seem to be something
different in shouting at a player about to
take a shot at the basket, there is in
fact no real difference between the shout
and the slap of the hand. The shout is
as real and as fair a method of defense
as is the hand; it is a mental difficulty
to be played against by the opposition
just as truly as the man between the of-

nel

fensive player and the basket is a phy-
sical difficulty to be evaded, and both
are equally legitimate as a means of de-
fense.

The questioning editorial stated that in
using the shout, our teams had adopted
tactics which other teams have failed
to adopt. A long list could be given of
the names of outstanding coaches in this
country who teach their teams to use the
throat as well as the arms and hands
in breaking up shots. It will be suffi-
cient, however, to mention Coach Tebell
of N. C. State, Coach Ruby of Illinois,
Coach Meanwell of Wisconsin, and Dr.
Allen of the University of Kansas as a
few of those who not only sanction but
also use a good, lusty yell as an im-
portant defensive device.

On pages 137-138 of “My Basketball
Bible” Coach Forrest C. Allen of the
University of Kansas, in describing how
a guard should approach a threatening
player, says, “A guard while advancing
should use his head, mouth, and feet to
good -advantage. He should talk his
opponents out of all thrusts on tries at the
basket that he possibly can. A shout
combined with a smart slap of the foot on
the floor and a feint to leap into the
air will act as a deterrent to many play-
ers on the offensive.”

Is more authority needed to convince
even the most skeptical that the tactics
taught our basketball teams by our coach-
es are as fair, as sportsmanlike, as truly
in accord with the Davidson code as those
employed. by them in all other branches
of sport? Is it not rather the custom
of whistling and calling on the part of
the spectators a deplorable practice that
has been on the increase this year—the
thing which we should guard against

as unworthy of representatives of David-
son?
