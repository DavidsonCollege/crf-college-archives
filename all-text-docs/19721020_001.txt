Blacks Present Grievances To College

By DOUG BROWN
Managing Editor

Davidson will not have any
black students at the end of this
academic year if 10 proposals
presented to the college are not
met, according to the Black
Student Coalition (BSC).

In a meeting with the Faculty
Executive Committee Monday
afternoon Ron Gibson,
president of the BSC, explained
the proposals, and he gave the
college till Nov. 15 to reply in
writing.

The BSC is calling for an in-
crease in the black enrollment
to ‘‘at least 150 within two
years,’ an African Studies
Program patterned after the
South Asian Studies Program,
and ‘‘several black faculty
members within two years."

In addition the BSC is seeking
a better social life for Davidson
blacks, and the appointment of
at least two blacks to ad-
ministrative positions within
the year.

Monday night several mem-
bers of the Faculty Executive
Committee attended a meeting
of the BSC to hear the views of
individual blacks. During the
two hour meeting faculty mem-
bers and = administrators
listened attentively as the 15
blacks present held nothing
back as they gave their honest
views about Davidson.

The 10 proposals were first
given to College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. and Vice
President for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan last April. Gib-
son claims little was done over
the summer to implement the
proposals.

As a result, according to Gib-
son, the BSC decided to place a
deadline for the proposals to be
met. He said if the proposals
are not met all prospective
black students’ will be
discouraged from coming to
Davidson.

Director of Admissions and

Financial Aid H. Edmunds
White, when informed of the ac-
tion of the BSC, voiced his
regret.

‘‘We will give the college a
one month grace period during
which we will neither en-
courage nor discourage black
students from applying to
Davidson,’ said Gibson. He
said if the college does not act
favorably by Nov. 15, the BSC
will put its plan into effect.

Many blacks claim that
Davidson will not be able to
recruit any more blacks without
their help. Larry Barr, a black
recently hired as an admissions
officer, said he did not know
what effect the action of the
BSC would have on his recruit-
ment of black students.

According to Gibson it will be
an individual decision by each
black on whether to leave
Davidson at the end of this
academic year.

However, he said the 20 mem-
ber BSC had unanimously
decided on this course of action,
and he did not know anyone who
would stay if the proposals were
not met.

Doctor Crisis Apparent With Davis Loss

By ALAN FORD
Staff Writer

Davidson College, as well as
northern Mecklenburg County,
may be without a doctor in the
near future. At present there
are only two doctors between
Charlotte and Mooresville, and
both of these doctors are of
retirement age.

One of the doctors, James R.
Gudger, came out of retirement
to accept a temporary position
as College Physician. The
position was vacant after
William A. Davis Jr., the college
Physician last year, resigned to

take a position at the Univer-
Sity of North Carolina at
Charlotte.

The other of the two doctors,
Jasper B. Woods Jr., is presen-
tly maintaining his private
practice in Davidson.

A committee consisting of one
member from each of the com-
munities in North Mecklenburg
(Davidson, Cornelius, Hun-
tersville, Davidson College and
Huntersville Hospital) has been
formed to seek a solution to this
dilemma. Dean of Students Will

Terry is the college's represen-
tative to this committee.
Since most doctors no longer

Trustees Scheduled To Hear
Reports On College Progress

By BOB HOWELL
Asst. Managing Editor

Next week's meeting of the
Board of Trustees promises to
be one of much discussion and
little actual legislation, ac-
cording to College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

“This does not seem to be a
meeting where there will be
much action taken,” he said.
‘It's more informational.”

While the board's committees
will generally be occupied with
reports on recent progress in
various areas of the college's
operation, Spencer anticipates
some definite action concerning
future student housing.

“It's not too early to start
drawing up specific plans.” he
asserted. “The Campus and
Social Life Committee and the
Building and Grounds Com-
mittee will meet jointly on this
matter.

“The first step would be the

board's contracting with an ar-
chitect. There's a lot to be done
if new housing is to be available
by 1974,’ Spencer stated.

Student fees for 1973-74 will be
discussed by the Finance Com-
mittee, Spencer noted, regar-
ding how much fees will be
raised if an increase is
necessary.

“I presume that, since we're
not yet definite as to next year's
budget. the Trustee Executive
Committee will be given the
power, as it was last year. to ef-
fect a necessary increase,
within certain limits.” Spencer
explained.

Regarding recent discussion
on the requirement that any
faculty member granted tenure
be an active member of a
Christian church, Spencer said.
“IT will inform both the
Religious Life Committee and
the Education Committee of the
faculty's interest in this area.

“No action can be taken by
the board at this point; the

faculty itself hasn't taken ac-
tion on the question," he added.

A report on the progress of
coeducation will be presented.
he said, concerning not only the
women students now enrolled
but also the status of female ap-
plicants for next year.

A question which “cannot yet
be resolved but should be
discussec"’ as a facet of
coeducai n involves eating
facilities for the projected 500
additional students. Spencer
said.

*‘Where do you put more food
service? Should we build new
units, or incorporate it into a
new Union. or the new housing
plan, or what?

“The campus radio station,”
Spencer added, “wants to apply
for an FM license and has asked
the board to act on this.”

The board will also hear a
report on the security measures
implementied this year and will
consider choices for honorary
degrees to be conferred at
Spring Convocation.

want an individual practice, the
committee is working on plans
to build a clinic near Hun-
tersville Hospital. This will
enable the doctors at the clinic
to have ready access to the
hospital if they need it and allow
them to use the hospital's x-ray
equipment.

Although no estimate of the
cost of the proposed clinic has
been announced, four possible
ways of financing the clinic
have been suggested.

These four possibilities are:

(1) for the community to raise
the money by subscription;

(2) for a private investor to
build the clinic and then lease it
out;

(3) for the doctors in the clinic
to build it;

(4) for a government agency
to finance the project.

As of now the committee is
planning a fund drive which will
help to pay the cost of the clinic.
It will begin during the latter
part of October.

Terry said that one of the doc-
tors at the clinic will be hired to
provide medical service to the
students of Davidson College.
The doctor will hold sick call at
the infirmary, and one of the
clinic's doctors will be on call at
all times.

Exactly what should be in-
cluded in the student health ser-
vices provided by the college is
an open question. Student Body
President Ralph Peeples said
that the college should provide
several ‘basic services."

In addition to sick call, the
maintaining of the infirmary
and its beds, and referrals to
hospitals, he listed “‘drug coun-
seling without fear of
retribution, abortion coun-
seling, dispensation of birth
control information and
materials free of charge, and
venereal disease counseling
and treatment with full con-
fidentiality.”

Peeples said there was also a

need for pregnancy counseling
and gynecological referral,

Coed Ginny Andrews echoed
several of Peeple’s comments.
She said that ‘‘the girls want a
gynecologist."

Andrews added that birth
control service and information
should be provided. ‘‘After
all,’ she said, ‘‘what if your
family doctor is 300 miles
away?"

Andrews also said that the
college should at least refer
students to an abortion referral
service.

“It is so much better,"’ she ad-
ded, ‘‘for the college to have a
competent referral service than
for the girls to end up with some
quack."*

When asked if any of these
ideas were being considered by
the college, Terry replied that
abortion counseling is done and
added ‘“‘Dr. Davis and I have
made abortion referrals in the
past."

On the matter of con-
fidentiality, Terry remarked,
“The specific information.about
a student's personal case should
be treated with the same con-
fidentiality as any other patient
that a doctor would treat."
