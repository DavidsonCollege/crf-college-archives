Mullen Ponders Artist’s Role,
Conducts Happening In Stowe

A Review

By GARY GARVIN
Staff Writer

A nude girl whirls across the
paper. What else could it be. but
another Stowe Gallery exhibit?

This month's show features
drawings of Phillip Mullen.
Past professor of art at North
Dalata, Ohio, and South Caro-
lina Universities, he has ac-
cumulated an impressive array
of exhibitions and awards
across the nation.

Mullen’s drawings indicate a
unique relationship between the
artist and his environment.
Throughout the show appear
many protraits of himself.
where his identity as an artist in

Perhaps he best reveals his
feelings about his status as an
artist in his ‘Self Portrait with
Robe and Camera." Here he
stands ready to click a camera
while at the same time exposes
his privates-his way of saying
gotcha!"

He becomes a Myra
Breckinridge figure in his ‘Self
Portrait as Queen.’ where he
displays himself in a reverse
identity pose. Some of his works
are homemade newspapers
which feature. among other
things. more of his self por-
traits.

No longer a passive recorder
of the world. he now becomes an
object of historical interest.

Other works reflect the way

Nixon, Football Team Praised

To the Editor:

I have several objections to
Mike Ernst’s offensive letter of
Oct. 5. In it he characterizes
Nixon as a deceitful. in-
competent criminal, waving the
bloody shirt in place of the
American flag.

He conveniently forgets that

_George McGovern himself is
not the Messiah he claims to be.
Under the guise of ‘new
politics’ he has created a
political machine of such vast
proportions that Boss Tweed
would turn green.

By using the vouth vote as a
lever. McGovern forced an un-
workable platform through the
Democratie committee. The
party has been molded in
George McGovern's image so

as to exclude’ dissent.
Democrats who don't like it can
leave the party.

As for the war, he forgets that
two Democratic presidents
built it up over an eight year
period to an extent thal. even
though hundreds of Americans
died in Vietnam, America was
reaching full emplovment. In a
capitalist economic system, full
employment is invariably a
manifestation of a war
economy.

Mr. Ernst also refuses to
recall that George McGovern
voted for the Tonkin Resolution
in 1964. It was only after John-
son announced that he would
not seek a second term that
George McGovern, seeing the
strength of the Buck Johnson
movement, let himself be
known as an anti-war leader.

In his enthusiasm for
McGovern, Ernst also scorns
those who see a vote for Nixon
as a vote for America. Yet he
blithely condones George
McGovern’ for __ rallying
Americans to his own special
brand of populist demagoguing.
Chauvinism ill suits either
camp.

It is true that both sides are
guilty of propoganda excesses
in this campaign. However. Mr.
Ernst. with his use of
exaggeration, double entendre
and character assasination,
typifies the worst aspect of the
campaign.

McGovern...

For the people?

Think about it.

To the Editor:

As an upperclassman eating
on half a meal ticket, I would
like to make some observations
about the situation on the court.
Admittedly the first week I won-
dered where all the money had

one. With appropriate

rugality. I have now
discovered how to get a very
satisfying meal for my money.

If they aren't an adequate
college food service. at least the
Slater Houses make a darn good
restuarant.

It continued until King Kudzu
emerged from the shadows and
waved a vine for silence. From
out of the jungle of his form
moved the Senior Puppeteer. a
marionette dangling from his
hand.

**Have you seen them?” he
‘wheezed under his breath.
“They're ali over campus and
they walk and they talk and all
on command and now Numb
Elroy is at peace."

“Come together,’ sang Numb
Elroy as a heel plowed into his
midriff. “over me.”

The Senior Puppeteer
hovered over Numb Elroy and
suspended the marionette
above his foot-mashed nose.

“See, Numb Elroy, how it is
different from you. how it cur-
ves and flows and wiggles at a
twitch of my fingers. how it is
yours, all yours. See and be at
peace.”

“Come together oof.’ sang
Numb Elroy, ‘‘over me.”
“And for this prize." crooned
King Kudzu. “you will befog
your eyes and with your silence

**Be at peace,"' whispered the
Senior Puppeteer but as he said
it, wonder ot wonders, the
marionette squirmed contrary
to his fingers. Visibly shaken.

These men deserve our sup-
port and complete loyalty. and
their having a winning season
depends to a large extent on
knowing that they have our
backing all the way.

Let's show our confidence in
them and our appreciation of
their sacrifices in every way
possible. That could be the dif-
ference between a big win or
something less encouraging.

the Puppeteer gripped it around
the waist to hold it still.

“Come together.” croaked
Numb Elroy. a toe jammed in
his ribcage. ‘over me.”

“Shutup!*” shouted the Pup-
peteer as the marionette opened
its mouth to speak. He shoved a
finger into its mouth but it
brought down its wooden teeth
hard on his knuckles. With a
squeal. he let it go. and it
escaped, a hundred automatons
lunging for its trailing strings.

But it did not run far. It stop-
ped before a figure that ap-
peared as if from nowhere, a
corps of henchmen crowded
around him: Don Guappo
Lasagne.

“Awright,"" he said in
melodious Anglo-Italian,
“whatda linguini is all dis
hullagullaboo?*

“Have a care, Greaseball,”
threatened the Puppeteer.
“Stand not in the path of Kudzu,
neither covet his property."

“Well, Ise got news for ya,
Stringfingers, I gots my own
people and dis here marionette,
she's part of dis staff. Don't
mess wit my family!”

“We know your weakness,"

he perceives his environment.
His figures are portrayed in a
multi-perspective approach. An
image is repeated or blurred
across the surface only to be
brought to a point of sharp focus
and repose.

Thus multiple images of the
nude in ‘‘S 4 (Slide w-notes)”
overlap, build from faintness to
clarity, as she progresses, then
recedes in time. (Do we see
Duchamp descending a stair-
case? Maybe.). Mullen's
dramatic composition proves
best in another slide. S 2 (Icarus
Woman)."’

In another group of his works.
the figures are static. in a fixed
time. yet the validity of their
presence in space is uncertain.
“The nude in the silkscreen
‘Girl in Soft Space’ appears in
a cloud of dotted colors in which
the foreground cannot easily be
distinguished from the
background.

Mullen places art and the ar-
tist in a social-historica! context
in his newspeners-as-art. In
these, he supplied the layout
and pictures. but left the rest of
the page blank for his friends to
fill out. Words and events
become subject matter in these.

In ‘Newspaper ‘Columbia in
Action)’’ quite improbable
events are predicted by his
friends. such as Big Brother
getting busted in 1984 or the end
of the Viet Nam war in 1974.

Finally, Mullen treats real ac-
tions as subjects for his art in
his “happenings.”’ Previously.
he has sponsored such events as
wrapping people in tinfoil.

who, with a wave of his tripod.
melted the Instamatic in the
very hands of the enemy.

“Enough of dis convolution
stuff. Mott,’ said Don Guappo,
turning to me, “I wants you
should incorporations into my
fistful year an Annal Visitation
to da neglected cattlecombs of
Davoidson Femalitude.”

But before anyone could
move, King Kudzu shot out a
vine and entwined the left-hand
strings of the marionette. Not to
be outdone, Don Guappo snat-
ched the other strings and
began’a tug-of-war.

The outcome remained un-
certain, first King Kudzu win-
ning and then Don Guappo until
they had pulled their victim
over the prone figure of Numb
Elroy.

“Come together.’* wailed
Numb Elroy. pummeled by foot
and vine. **Come together. right
now, over me.”

And the strangest thing of all
was that as we watched the
Struggle. I realized that the
marionette alone among the
crowd remained silent.
