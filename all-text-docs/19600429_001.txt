announced in chapel Friday and
additional nominations may be

There has been much specule-

AED Gives Award
To Local Chapter

The Davidson chapter of the
Alpha Epsilon Delta Fraternity,
international pre-medical frat-
ernity, has received a trophy
for outstanding work over the
past two years. This trophy,
known as the National Achieve-
ment Award, was accepted by
Rick Aderhold of the Davidson
chapter at the National Conven-
ton held at the University of
Louisville in Louisville, Ken-
tucky in April.

This award is one of the three

gories. It is based on service to

dents. These

and to pre-medical students.

These special services con-
sist of informative programs
to freshmen during orienta-
tion period, open meetings,
first-aid, and films
and lectures. Other areas in-
clude high membership require-
ments, field trips, and publicity.

This National Achievement
Award was awarded following

tion of a report written by the

Anderson, Cole Quit,
Force New Election

By WARREN COLLINS

Staff Writer

The election of Scott Lacy and Harrison Wellford as

new Chairman and Secretary, respectively, of the Honor

Court was announced Thursday night by out-going

ation of internal aspects of stu
dent life.”

Newly-installed student body
President, Henry Shue, and new
Honor Court Chairman, Scott
Lacy, both agree on the effec-
tive function and succéss of the
Honor Court during its first
year. Neither favor its reabsorp-
tion by the Student Council.

BASIC PROGRAM

The policy and basic program
of Shue and Lacy for the Honor
Court’s coming year include
asking the Student Council to
appropriate money to buy tapes
and a recorder in order to make
a permanent record of each trial
and to standardize trial proce-
dure by constitutional amend-
ment (for example—there is at
present no stated quorum neces-
sary for the functioning of the
Honor Court.)

President Shue said. also, “I
think we need to. clarify the
question of whether or not an
Honor Court member must re-
sign permanently before run-
ning for another office—such as
a student body office, Also, the
Honor Court should have the
additional power of bringing im
peachment proceedings against
student body officers who act
out of accord with the constitu
tion..I would also say that the
objection of some that students
are not qualified and capable of
judging fellow students is not
a valid one as long as it is pos-
sible to appeal a student deci
sion to the faculty.”

DRINKING QUESTION
Lacy has also stated that
he would like a definite state-

ment of the drinking question
