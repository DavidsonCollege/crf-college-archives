Falcons. Hit ’Cats
In Diamond Debut

The Wildcat baseballers trav-
eled to Misenheimer Wednesday
to play the first of two exhibi-
tion games with Pfeiffer's Fal-
cons. The ‘Cats round out their
exhibition schedule here Satur-
day in what will be the first
game on the Wildcats’ new dia-
mond.

Buddy Durham, Gene Bennett
and Charlie Elliott saw mound
duty for the ‘Cats, as Coach
Tom Stevens decided to let his
senior moundsmen have the first
game of the season. Each team
will use three pitchers Saturday
in an effort to let everyone have
some game experience before
the season opens officially on
Monday.

The ‘Cats host Virginia Mon-
day and Tuesday.

The first conference games
are in a doubleheader here next
Friday against West Virginia.

Gene Bennett looked especially
sharp on the mound for the ‘Cats

in his three-inning stint. Most
of the few mistakes which were
made were the result of not hav-
ing played for a long time, and
nearly all would have to be
classified as mental rather than
physical errors.

Other bright spots for the
‘Cats, who vow, ‘We'll win our
share this year,"’ were Frank
Murphy, whose speed should be
a great asset; Jack Smith in
centerfield, who also has good
speed: big Hank Strickland, who
will be one of the finest catch-
ers around this year; and sev-
eral others. Once the team gains
some confidence, the ‘Cats could
be tough this year.

Stevens announced that the
new field would be equipped
with an electric scoreboard and
a public address system and
that the whole works would be
dedicated in a formal ceremony
on May 6.

SOLID FOES

Netmen Eye SC Replay ee" ”

By YATES FAISON
Assistant Sports Editor

In an effort to repeat last year’s Southern Conference championship, Coach Harry
Fogleman’s fun-loving netters set out to open a rugged schedule here.at 2 p.m. Tues.

day against Northwestern, one of the top Big 10 teams.

Fogleman was cautious in pre-
dicting the plight of this year's
squad, but he did concede that
‘we'll have another winning sea-
son. We are pretty strong all the
way down the line. and I think
that we can win the conference

‘jon our depth.”

Esmond Phelps will rate the

_|No. 1 slot in Fogleman’s tenta-
|tive two-game lineup. Playing

behind Phelps will be Sam

:|Hatcher, Dan Hearon, captain
“|Peter Parrott, Geordie Mueller
and Dave Jennings. ‘Hatcher.

and Phelps are playing better
than last year,"’ remarked Fo-
gleman. ‘I would say Hearon
and Jennings are the most im-
proved."

The most striking loss is the
absence of Steve and Woody
Faulk. Steve transferred to Tu-
lane, while Woody left for a year
in Germany. ‘‘Woody was play-

+|ing wonderfully,” said Fogle-
-}man. And referring to brother

Steve, he added, ‘‘Since tennis
is a non subsidized sport, we lost
one of our best potential play-
ers to a school that gave him a
scholarship.”

The consensus of the team is
that the season will be tough but
that they have the team to meet
it. ‘We've got a rough sched-
ule," said Hatcher, “but we have
the potential to do well with it.
We'll really have to play our
best in a few matches."

Parrott added that he expect-
ed a harder schedule than ever
before. “It's a long schedule.
We'll have to have a better bal.
anced team than in the past,
which I think we have. This year
we get a chance to play some
Big 10 schools and can get a
look at what tennis is like out-
side of the conference.

Phelps said he thought the sea-
son would be more challenging
but he was looking forward to
the lid-lifter. “The whole team."

Cannon I Racks
Freshman Field

Cannon I completely dominat-
ed the field events in the fresh-
men division of the IMAC track
meet to grab first place.

Pat Mullen and Steve Butler
both managed to win one event
and place in another, Mullen
winning the shot put and Butler
the discus. Tommy Norwood
gave the team some balance by
pulling out a victory in the
1,320-yard run. Another big man
for CannonI proved to be Scott
Davis, who placed second in
both the broad jump and the
high jump and third in the 440.

The greatest individual per-
formance was given by Whit
Morrow, who led Watts with
firsts in the 220 and. 440 plus a
second in the 100-yard dash.
Carl Salter added to the glory
of Watts by running first in the
100 ahead of Morrow and by
throwing the discus well enough
for fourth.

East IT lost second place to
Watts by a single point despite
the fact that Glenn Praay won
the broad jump and Ken Hill
the high jump. Hill also manag.
ed to place second in the 220
and third in the 100.

Mike Culbreth showed his
in the fiel
events, grabbing second, thir

and fourth-place finishes. He

and Steve Hayes, who finished

behind Norwood in the 1320 and
fourth in the high jump. led the
Cannon II aggregation to its

fourth place finish.

scoring in the shot put and
broad jump respectively gave

Runners Begin
In Double Meet

By DON SEWELL
Sports Writer

Davidson's varsity cindermen
get the outdoor track season un-
derway with a double meet
against High Point and Wofford
here Saturday. The meet be-
gins at 1:30 p.m. with the field
events, followed by the track
events at 2.

The meet will be scored as
two separate meets—not as a
triangular match. “‘I will be dis-
appointed if we do not. win both
meets,”’ said Coach Heath Whit-
tle. “I have a much stronger
and better balanced team this
year than last.”

Bili Randolph, Tom Baker,
Roane Cross and Tom Newberry
will throw the shot in Satur-
day's meet. Randolph placed
fourth in the Southern Confer-
ence indoor meet, and Whittle
expects him to win the event.
Bill Bryan, John Fagg. Phil
Ray, Cross and Randolph will
throw the discus, with Bryan the
top threat.

Bill Kendrick and Randolph
are entered in the javelin. As-
sistant coach Sterling Martin
commented that Kendrick is a
potential conference champion
in this event and that he should
do a strong job Saturday.

Greg Cox and Lou Hill are
Davidson's entrants in the broad
jump and the triple jump. Both
are good in the triple jump
event and they could provide a
one-two finish in the event.

George Rogister. Tony Orsbon
and Cox will be doing the high
jumping for the Wildcats. Bill
Blackstock is the only Davidson
contestant in the pole vault.

“Our team is especially strong
in the field events. We should
be able to win a great many
points in those events Satur.
day," added Whittle.

Tom Caldwell and Cox will
run the 100-yard dash for the
‘Cats. Caldwell has been doing
well in practice and has a good
chance to win the event. Cald-
well and Charles Cameron will
enter in the 220-yard dash.

Eddie Rice, Mike Moates,
John Flowers, and Bill Davis
will run the 440. Rice, the
strongest Davidson contender, is
expected to finish well in the
meet. Barry St. Clair, outstand-
ing cross-country runner last
fall, has a good chance to win
the 880.

Randy Philips will be carry-
ing the distance load alone Sat-
urday. Philips is entered in both
the mile and the two-mile runs.
Rogister will run the high hur-
dies and the 330 intermediate
hurdles. Cox will join him in the
330-yard event.

A team consisting of Caldwell,
Cameron, Rice and Cox will run
the 440 relay for Davidson.
Flowers, St. Clair and Moates,
Davis or Rice will compete in
the mile relay.

Whittle commented that he
does not know much about the
strength of either of Saturday's
opponents. He added that his
team should be in comparable
condition because this will be
the first outdoor meet for all
three schools. Neither High
Point nor Wofford has indoor fa-
cilities. Whittle concluded, ‘‘All
in all, I am expecting a good
performance to start off a good
season.”

cially liked the trips.

The Wildcats will face solid
roadblocks in addition to North-
western, Harvard, Clemson. Rol-
lins and Presbyterian offer the
toughest test outside the confer-
ence. The stiffest opposition
within the SC should come from
George Washington. The Citadel

“The Southern Conference

big boost to us. especially his
exemplary sportsmanship.”

Initial Match Runaways
Exhibit Golfers’ Strength

By GEORGE ROBINSON
Sports Writer

The Davidson linksters gave strong support to predictions of another top season
when they solidly trounced The Citadel, GW and Furman in a four-way match Mon-

day at Myrtle Beach, S. C.

The Wildcats enjoyed margins of 1742-% over The Citadel, 17-1 against GW
and 13%-4% over the Paladins in completing their conference requirement.

With all but three men return-
ing from last year’s Southern
Conference championship squad,

the Davidson golf team will be

a strong favorite to repeat their

‘ previous performance.

Senior captain Joe Jelks, jun-
iors Johnny Giles, George Leight
and Bruce Vanderbloemen. and
sophomores Cary Hite and Mike
Spann are expected to lead the
attack. Seniors Walter Daniel
and Tucker Laxton, junior Tuck-
er Dalton and sophomore K. D.
Weeks will add depth to the
squad.

Dr. Scott said, ‘‘We have a
better balanced team this year.
and we will be a strong contend-
er, favored {o-win the title
again.”

Last year the HinkSters domi
nated the tournament, sweeping
the first four places and drub-

bing second-placed William and
Mary by 21 strokes and third-
placed West Virginia by 32 in
the 36-hole medal play. The
above two teams will provide
the toughest competition this
season, Scott predicted.

During spring break the link-
sters will compete in the Cape
Coral Invitational Tournament
in Florida. This tourney features
such outstanding teams as de
fending champion Florida. Filor-
ida State. Louisiana State, Pur-
due, Columbia. Princeton, North
Carolina, Duke and Wake For

The Wildcats will play their
home matches at the Charlotte
Country Club and Quail Hollow
Country Club. Working under a
real handicap, the Jinksters have
