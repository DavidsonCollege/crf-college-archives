“The Davidsonian

.Zimmermann defends decision

Continued from page 1]

“Davidson is a finely tuned
operation,’’ said Zimmer-
mann. “If there is wild fluctu-
ation in the number of courses
taken or in the people present,
there are problems. We don’t
want to see irregularity and
fluctuation in enrollment.”’

For instance, the majority
of this year’s senior class has
enough credits to take reduced
londs. Some even have enough
to graduate in March. Zim-
mermann feels if too many
students took advantage of
their extra credits, more stu-

dents would graduate early. -

The school depends upon
these students’ continuing tui-
tion to maintain steady fiscal
management. Zimmermann
said, ‘‘With a 13:1 ratio of

students to faculty, the depar-:

ture of only 13 students would

undermine the salary of one

faculty member.”’
Zimmermann said, theoreti-

cally, all courses are equiva-

lent and, therefore, unless
there is a substantial reason
for taking a reduced load such

disability or certain types of

There is no news this week.
It has been said that no news is good news. The Davidsonian holds
a different maxim: no news is bad news.
When there are no issues on campus The Davidsonian had a difficult people who read the thing, not that
time filling up sixteen pages of blank paper.
But The Davidsonian worries more about seeing the campus

mind.

‘work, a student should take

the required load.
Furthermore a number of_

‘supporters feel that students

who take two courses are a
cause of demoralization on the
part of students taking three
courses, since the former have™
more time to spend on their
work, giving them unfair ad-
vantage grade-wise.

According to Zimmermann
there is a need for continuity
in a Davidson education. Da-
vidson is a full time institution
and many supporters agreed
that students who do not want
to go to Davidson College full
time are wasting both the time
and facilities available to them
when there are people who
wish to be full time students
and are not accepted.

Those who oppose the three

course requirement argue that -
so few people choose to take
two courses that the admini-
station should worry about
such petty matters.

The opponents feel that
the administration is taking a
paternalistic attitude towards
students.

“Students, if they are ahead
is their credits should be
mature enough to decide for
themselves if they should take
three courses or not,’’ said
junior Peggy Noel, a member
of the EPC, ‘‘I don't think
more outside interference is
necessary.”

According to some faculty
members the school is not only
taking a paternalistic attitude
towards students, but the
policy forces students to con-
form and leaves them no time

to think nonacademic prob--
lems out if they need to.

Another argument is that
since in practice not all courses
are equivalent in the amount
of work they give, a student
might need more time and not
be able to handle three courses
in one term.

Students will still be able to
submit requests to the CRC
for reduced loads. Simply
being ahead, though, will not
by itself be an adequate factor
for approval.

Eight students were given
approval to take two courses
winter term. Those who were
not approved can still appeal
to the Executive Committee.

‘‘The enforcement of this
policy may adversely affect
the number who will apply
next term,”’ concluded Burts.

There is news at Davidson, more than the student body want to

hear.

issues such as whether extra credits is a valid reason for taking two

courses instead of three in a term, whether the Trustees did not fulfill
their last spring promises when they drew up the enacting statement,
whether the College is raising money as successfully as other

_colleges, whether the curriculum is broad enough or not, whether the
Athletic budget is too high, whether the faculty moral is low, whether

a semester system is preferable, whether Davidson is a healthy
atmosphere when the main philosphy in hiring and firing faculty

seems to be “who fits in.”

On the Edge

Ralphy calls it quits

By KEVIN SHELLY
Staff Writer
“Well look, if Ellison can write one
book and quit, why can’t I quit
writing this tripe?’’ I responded to
Entwistle’s inquiry.
“Because of this,’’ countered Jim,

brandishing his fist. “And save the
literary illusions for the other two

anyone knows what the hell youre
talking about.”’

“Sticks and stone may break my
bones, but history majors don’t even

“Just go home and talk to Ralphy
and do whatever you two do toge-
ther.”

““Get drunk and wish we were
getting some.”

fe)

Well Ralphy and I kicked it around
and we couldn’t come up with much
for our swan song. Course Beetho-
ven’s 9th wasn’t his best either. I
mean how do you combine pathos and
profound insight without being
schmaltzy? Buy then, what's it all
about besides the struggle to do so on
your own terms?

— 1 -guess.if there’s anything to be
culled from the debris of earlier
columns that it would be to find your
own terms for contending with all the

tended with. And Ralphy adds not to
multiply your problems by being a
problem to yourself. Howard the
Duck has as much right to your
attention as Tolstoy--the trick is in
knowing when you need which, not
trying to categorize and compare
them and knowing how to leave them

and go_when_you’ve outgrown each

other. And I suppose the same goes
for people.

A none too understanding fellow
feared that Ralphy and me might use
the soapbox of a column to vent our
spleens, but there are more important
ways to fill space, which brings us
back to people. Almost everything
goes back to people if you trace it
along far enough, but usually we’re
content to label something an insti-
tution or a tradition and let it go.
What we need to do is push the
politics aside, (after all Abbie Hoff-
man was at least right about politics)

nd concentrate on the particulars of
human relationships.

There are some fine people here, but

!

then that is so most everywhere you
go. The particular appeal of the
people here‘ is the infinite potential
they have in them to grow, change,
and expand. The shame is just how
many have: channelized themselves,
cutting off so much of what it means
to be a complex and contradictory
human creature. What we need to do
is become more at home with our
natures and acknowledge what walk-
ing paradoxes each of us is, and will
continue to be, so tong as we're truly
human. | ee

- The best thing we could all do for
each other is to forego about ten hours
of tube time during mid year break
and read or reread Buber's I and
Thou and Between Man and Man.
Lest we be too gauzy about Buber’s
expectations, perhaps R.D. Laing’s
Politics of Experience will provide the
proper element of skepticism to
remind us just how difficult it is
gonna be. But if it were easy would it
be near so important? Ralphy and I
think not.

Well, Ralphy and me just been
chastised by two of the people who
made this place important for us
because._we're_skippin’ town.All the .
big bills have been paid, but the little
debts remain, which sorta makes us
feel like thieves makin’ off with the
family silver. A lot of life is the
unconscious: squaring of accounts of
human giving and we know we're
leaving with a lot of little debts that
may not seem like much on an-
individual basis but are bigger than

Getty’s millions when added up. So
tor those of you who gave so gener-

ously, we thank you, not knowing
what else to say that can be adequate.
And we appologize for leaving ‘things
up in the air, but if we waited around
till parity was reached, they might
just be burying us here.

Goodbye and thanks and keep in
mind that the woods are full of
wardens. If any of you need to collect
on our overdrawn accounts you can
write to us in care of the parents back
in Upper Darby, home of Jim Croce,
Todd Rundgren, John Cappelette,
and us. We'll be out somewhere
shooting dragons--they don’t move as
fast in the winter--at least that’s what
the other romantic warriors tell us.
