Overseas Experiences

Told By Lamp Light

“Bob” Miles Tells of American “Y”

in France.

Sunday night, even tho there were no
lights, the regular Y. M. C. A. service
was held as usual.

Mr. Miles gave a very interesting talk
in regard to his overseas service with the
“Y.”” The fact chat there were no lights
gave a very fit setting to Mr. Miles’
address, as he said his meetings overseas
were held by candle light.

From the time Mr. Miles left New
York for overseas duty he was actively
engaged in the “Y” service for the fel-
lows “over there.” He was attached to
the qth Machine Gun Batallion of the
and Division. Some very vivid incidents
were related by Mr. Miles showing the
intense interest the fellows, tho — they
were regular army men, had in the “Y.”
The “Y” huts served as a place of recre-
ation during the week and a place of
worship on Sunday. For a while Mr.
Miles was stationed at a detraining sta-
tion just back from the Verdun front.
Here he served hot chocolate to the boys
who were starting on their hike to the
front.

‘Tho these fellows were, to use a slang
expression, a little “hard” at times, deep
down in their hearts they were Chris-
tions.

Football Men to Get

Handsome Sweaters
Freshmen Abide By the Old Custom.

All the football men agree with Pitts
Douglas when he said “I'm glad I’m go-
ing to get a sweater, but | wish they’d
come before all the cold weather is over.”

Weill, the sweaters have been ordered
and ought to be here in a few days. ‘They
would have been ordered a good bit
sooner if it hadn't been that so many of
the Freshmen had not been “financially
embarrassed.” As it is there are still
about thirty who are holding their dol-
lar tight in their pucket.

‘The sweaters will be black, V-neck
style, with a big red D on the front of
them. ‘They are going to be of good
quality, so the football men will be am-
ply rewarded for waiting on them.

The tennis season, altho a little out of
place, is upon us. The woefully small
number of decent courts is again notice-
able.

Crack Brown, '21, spent the week-end

at his home in Cleveland.

Paul Brown, ex-21, was on the hill

last week for a short visit.

From the shots on the campus last Fri-
day vight a-visitor might have assumed
that the lacal association of the bolshe-
viki was in’ session,

* * *

Mr. Miles made-a trip to Westmin-
ster School at Rutherfordton on ‘Tues-
day of last week to help start off the Y.
M. C. A. work there.

The Rumpleites are progressing well
with their scheme for cutting up the
campus. Their path from their abode to
the Phi hall becomes plainer every day.

N.Y. Pharr, 19, broke all precedents

and did not spend Sunday in Charlotte.

Davidson was about a year late in-ob-
serving lightless nights. It was done on
last Saturday, however, under universal
protest:

Among those present at the basketball
game last Friday evening were Misses
Maude Dawson, Jean Bryan and Mil-
dred Smith, guests of the Bachelors.

Shearer Hall has successfully recover-
ed from the operation of ‘“reroofing.”
Its appearance has changed considerably.
Besides its new red roof it has three ven-
tilators like those on Georgia. Work on
Shearer Hall has been going on for some
time, and Dr. Martin is probably much
relieved that the hammering on the roof
during chapel has stopped.

day morning the following men were

and Doubles were the mainstays of the} w

Fresh team. Until this game. the Fresh-
men had high hopes of winning the
championship, but all their hopes were
shattered when the final whistle blew.
However, they put up a splendid fight as
the score shows. One of the prettiest
shots of the game was made by Denny
of the Fresh team during the second half;
when he tossed the ball into the basket
from the middle of the floor.
