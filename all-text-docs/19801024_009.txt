Soccer drops fifth of last six games

By STEVE SOUD
Staff Writer

The soccer team has lost five
of its last six games, and the
sweet victories of the beginning
of the season and hopes those
victories spawned are beginning
to look sour and premature.

In another key game last
Wednesday, the Cat kickers let
Furman walk all over them. At
the end of the first half, Furman
held a 1-0 edge, and the
Wildcats stood a very good
chance for a come-from-behind
win. Furman shelved that
chance in the second half,
scoring three unanswered goals
to put the game on ice.

The team had a good chance
to redeem itself and get back on
a. winning track Saturday
against UNC-Charlotte, but the
booters again came up short,
this time in front of the Home-
coming crowd. UNCC took a 1-0
lead after what Coach Charlie
Slagle considered ‘‘a lackluster”’
Davidson first half, but the
Wildcats started the second half
snortin’ and rarin’ to go. Right
from the opening tap, Chris
Roberts followed the ball in
through a surprised UNCC
team to tie a 1-1 knot in the
score.

The momentum was defin-
itely swinging in Davidson's

favor when UNCC gave the
Cats a penalty kick—a goal on a
silver platter. The ‘“‘goal that
could have won the game”’ w:
just inches shy of a score, and
the pipe shot gave the guests
new life while taking a little
steam from the hosts.

Forty-niner Tureh Doh inter-
cepted a throw-in and scored
the go-ahead goal one-on-one
for the Charlotte team. Minutes
later, they padded their lead,
3-1. With about two and a half
minutes left, Hamilton scored
to pull the Cats within one, 3-2,
and a possible tie. Then the
Wildcats again squandered a
golden opportunity when, with
:30 remaining, they missed an
open shot.

When a team as talented as
the Davidson starts losing con-
sistently to teams of lesser
caliber, ‘‘there are problems,’
admitted Slagle. ‘‘When you
lose the Southern Conference
Coach of the Year, there may be
an attitude problem,” contin-
ued the first year coach. He
pointed out, though, that thé
team of last year was similarly
1-5 across the same stretch last
year.

After the Furman loss, Slagle
called a team meeting, after
which play improved on Sat-
urday against UNCC even

. though one of our players was

ejected.

The team had another tough
game yesterday at Winthrop,
and Sunday they travel to
Western Carolina astroturf.
Next Wednesday they host
USC-Spartanburg in one of
their few remaining games.

The opening 6-0 record now
stands in a different light, but
with a couple of wins down the
stretch, the team can finish
with a very respectable record.

took impressive 1-2 spots, and
although Davidson finished
10th with 268 points, only 25
points separated the Wildcats
from 9th place St. Augustine’s
(257) and 8th place Wake Forest
(243(.

Davidson’s women fared
somewhat better with. fourth
place finish in a 11 team field.
Tamare Foreman led the squad
in 21:03.1 for a 26th place finish
in the 5,000 meter race. Only
seven and twelve seconds be-
hind her, in 29th and 32nd
places respectively, were team-
mates Marion Hill and Carrie
Nunn. Melissa Peacock
(21:46.9), Merris Hollingsworth
(21:46.9), and Jane Thompson
(22:28.3) also ran well, finishing
36th, 37th, and 39th.

Both the men and women
travel to Wilmington, N.C. this
weekend for a three-way meet
with UNC-Wilmington and The
Citadel. While the meet serves
as a final tune-up before the
Southern Conference Champ-
ionships for the men, it presents
the women with their last
competition of the 1980 season.
Most of the women will keep in
shape over the winter, however,
in anticipation of the spring
track and field season.

QB Brian Whitmire rolls out.

o With 14:02 remaining in the
first half, Yeager snagged a

58-yard pass for his third
touchdown.

Yeager, sixth among NCAA
I-AA receivers after five games,
singlehandedly put the game
out of reach for the Wildcats
with his seven receptions for
178 yards and three touch-
downs.

The Wildcats did get on the

‘board before the first half ended

when halfback Bob Miller
skirted down the field for a
34-yard score. The point-after
attempt failed.

Lehigh reciprocated by scoring
on its next possession, on a
3-yard run by Jim Evanko.

The third quarter brought a
bright moment for Davidson as
split end Gifford Piercy pulled
in a Whitmire pass at the 10
yard line and left Lehigh de-
fenders Charles Marck and
Keith Conley in their tracks
with two superb fakes. The
34-yard scoring pass and the
sucessful two-point conversion
were the last times that the
Cats were to put points on the
board.

Lehigh defensive back
Charles Marck intercepted a
Whitmire pass to Piercy and
took the ball into the endzone
for a 34-yard score. In the
fourth quarter, the Engineers
went on to score twice more,
once on a 6-yard Mickalski pass
to tight end Paul Anastasio
with 12:19 left and once on the
5-yard run of John Ashler at the
8:14 mark.

At the end of an overcast and
rainy day, the Lehigh squad
had covered 226 yards on the
ground and 288 yards in the air,
compared to Davidson’s 106
yards rushing and 162 yards
passing.

The powerful Lehigh team
beat Davidson in every statisti-
cal category.
