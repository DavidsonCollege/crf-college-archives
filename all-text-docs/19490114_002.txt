Changes In Stud que

Recent developments in the Student Store
issfle hiave caused many campus leaders to
wonder whetlier or not substantial changes
should be made in the way in ‘whieh the Stu-

dent Store is run. Two good reasons far ef-
fecting some sort of a change that will eut
stand out

over and bevond, perhaps, the consideration

out possibilities of future losses
of the actual money lost

In the tirst place, is it right to put tempta-
tons such as are involved in handling stu-
dent’ store funds before the students who do
the clerking. While the theory that a David-
son student will walk a mile to pay back a
‘amel that he bummed is all well and good,
it does not always work out——as we have
seen. The boys who ‘work in the store, for the-
most part, have a hard time making ends
meet, Sometimes as much as eight hundred
dollars a day in cash passes through the store.
Are we iustified in putting a temptation of
such dimensions in front of anybody? Should
honesty be facilitated?
be made difficult ?

Should dishonesty

In the seeonfl place, when losses have
cropped up, there is almost no way under
the present set-up of finding the cause of
losses. In the present case, part, at least, of
the total loss was attributed to student pil-
fering when the whole blame did not belong
there, No one, whether he be clerk, store
Manager, or just a student customer can be—
sure that he is entirely free of suspicion.

The Student Council is calling upon the
student body to consider these things, to
study the situation and decide whether
changes should be made. A-change that
would get rid of these situations-would be to
hire a full-time manager for the store and
make him responsible for losses. The catch
here is to find a man who can-and will do
the job. Almost certainly to secure a man

who would be willing to take the responsi-
bility involved, we would have to sacrifice
our open shelf-figure your own bill methods
and with it our precious honor system.

Just how precious is our honor system? Is
there any value in knowing that sou are
among people who cherish honesty and make
an effort to impress it upon those around
them? ‘

Is there anything good about having a
place like the Stud where you ean meet and
talk and shoot bull and feel like you are
trusted entirely? Is there something about a
plan that’s unbusiness-like, even foolishness,
and yet works (?) beeause this is Davyitlson.

Or, on the other hand, is it foolish to say
that the store can be governed by: the honor
system in the same way that an exam or re-
view is? Ts there any basis at all for thinking
that the honor system can. correct the Stud
situation?

It is those questions that the Student Coun-
cil is asking us to think about. They want
to the
students think. Let’s give them some opinions

some ideas—they want know what

to base their judgments on.

Blame It On Marshal

Why put out a paper this week? There's

not much news, Managing editors, like every-
body else are busy with last-minute pre-
exam catching up Term papers, and parallel
are beginning to get imperative and last-
minute reviews come around to our doors
just like everybody else's. Why..then a paper
this week?

[It’s a long story and it goes ‘way back to
the vear TSOL, A fellow named Adams who
at the time President of the United States
stayed up. late one night, as Davidson stu-
dents are wont to do at this time of year,

One of those ‘midnight oil” appointees
was a fellow named John Marshall whom he
appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme

Court, and who is indirectly responsible for
this issue. Por, two of the most famous cases

The cases were involved, as every student
of history or economies: knows, but the pre-
cedent set was that a contract is an invieleble
thing, sacred, not to be broken. Now, the
Davidsonian has a contract with a national
advertising firm that specifies the date on
which certain-ads are to be rn.

So, don’t feel like the news just couldn't
wait, and don't get the idea that managing
editors would have insomnia if they went

Becoming A Christian
Our Book of Church Order ‘states five

questions which are to be answered by those
who unite with the Church by profession of
faith. The first three questions have to do
specifically with accepting Christ as Saviour
and becoming followers of Him. They in-
clude:

First, the acknowledgment of sin in God’s
sight, for which we deserve His displeasure
have hope only in His meréy,

Second, faith inthe Lord Jesus Christ, as
the Bon of God and Saviour of sinners: ac-
ceping Him and trusting Him alone as a per-
sonal Saviour.

Third, a resolution and promise, not in our
Strength but with the help of the Holy Spirit,
to endeavor to live as the followers of Christ
should live.

Tifth, submission te government and dis-
cipline, and a promise to seek to preserve the

purity-and-mity-of the-Churete’sHte-and- fet

lawship. When these five questions have been
answered satisfactorily before the Session,

which is composed of the pastor and the.

ruling elders of. the congregation, we are re-
ceived into the membership of the Chureh,

We have made our profession of faith, we

‘have taken our stand for Christ, wwe have en-

tered openly and actively upon His service.

byterian Church, U. S.

Davidson was a small college in
1876 when Caleb Richmond Hard
ing came here as a stripling of 15.
Spry as a cricket then, even as
now, Richmond Harding was a fleet
runner by virtue of his light weight,
and: also a fine high jumper at
Davidson. Dr, Egbert W. Smith,
‘82, has always reminded Davidson
men that Dickie Harding was quite
an athlete in his own way, and how
much terrain he could cover in one
of his kangaroo hops. The youny
student tried hard to develop hi
| chest and bicepts by persistent use
jof the parallel bars at Davidson, and
later on at Johns Hopkins, but soon
had to give up even this slight
amount of exercise, and also tennis,
of which he was inordinately fond

“The men whom I knew in Col
leve that have made a name as men
of character and men of intellect, as
the winners of life’s honors, are the
men who early began to live in
earnest, who quickly learned™to
stand alone, to use their liberty ani
not to abuse it, and to set their
faces flint-like towards the dawning
of a new day,” said Dr, Harding,
when speaking of his college days.
“Those who fritter away their time
in college sometimes, but rarely
attain.”

Having been graduated fron:
Davidson in 1880, Dr. Harding did
post-graduate wark at Johns Hop-
kins University the next year,
taught in Charlotte two years an?
was professor of Greek at Hamp-
