MRS. M. J. FLOW IS
ACCIDENTALLY INJURED

Mrs. M. J. Flow was found in an
unconscious condition in her home on
Concord street one day last week. She
had suffered a severe fall, in which the
back of her head had struck. Although
the outer skull was unbroken, one of the
delicate interior bones was fractured,
which wounded the brain, and caused
the blood to clot on the spinal column.
Mrs. Flow was carried to Charlotte on
Friday, and an operation was performed.
There is very slight chance of her re-
covery.

Mrs. Flow’s children, Drs. William
and Frank Flow, of Kannapolis; Prof.
C. B. Flowe, of Fayette, Mo.; Lloyd
Flow, of Derita, and Mrs. Easley, of
Statesville, have been summoned to her
bedside.

Y. M. C. A. MEETING.

On last Thursday night Mr. H. F.
Beatty ('03) gave a very interesting
talk on Cuba, where he has served sev-
eral years as a missionary. He first de-
scribed the country, pointing out the
most important places and mountains.
He said, that they have been so crushed
down by the Roman Catholic Church
and Spain for centuries that there is
hardly a spark of‘manhood left in them.
And yet, although Cuba is called a Ro-
man Catholic country, only a very small
fraction of the people ever go to church
and a still smaller fraction know or un-
derstand anything that they do. He
compared the Christian with the non-
Christian and showed how Christianity
was uplifting the people and influencing
their lives for good.

He concluded with a plea for Cuba.
He said that this countrv had been piti-
fully neglected by the church, and that
additional aid was needed to carry on
the work that others had been forced to
drop.
