New RHC Policy
Coldly Rebuffed

By DOUG BROWN
Asst. Managing Editor

Academic Vice President
John M. Bevan called’ the
RHC’c open dorms resolu-
tion an ‘‘usurpation of pow-

er.” He said that ex-RHCwy

Chairman Cecil Burney did
not have the power to pro-
claim 24-hour open dorms.

“The hours defined for

dorms are basic regulations,
and there is a way we go
about changing these regula-
tions,”’ Bevan said.
' He added that if the RHC
wanted to change the pre-
sent dorm hours, it should
have brought the resolution
“before the faculty.

“By proclaiming open
dorms, Cecil is usurping
power which: he does not
possess, and from what I
understand of him, Cecil is
not one to usurp power,”
Bevan commented.

Asian Festi ‘val Fea tures India’ ’s Jha

The west will be exposed
to the east next week even
if the twain are
never to meet.

Frederick H. Gaige, in-
structor of Asian studies, has
organized Davidson's South
Asian Festival. ‘‘to concen-
trate some of the resources
that we had to make this a
major learning experience in
the field of Asian studies.”

Included in the
program, which runs from
Monday to Saturday, are
speeches by the _ Indian

Indian ambassador to the.

United States, Jakshmi Kant
Jha, and Professor Gerald
Graham, a program of In-
dian music and an exhibition
of Tibetan art.

Gaige explained that sev-
eral groups at Davidson
have combined to bring the

individual features of the
festival together.

“Ambassador Jha is a
Reynolds Lecturer and Dr.
Graham is sponsored by the
South Asian studies depart-
ment and the history depart-
ment. A film, ‘Shakespeare
Wallah,” is being shown ‘in
cooperation with the Fine
Films Committee.”

Gaige indicated that the
Davidson festival would be
one of the most ambitious of
‘its type in this region of the
country.

“The University of North
jCarolina at Greensboro had
a festival on the far east,
but -it-was less elaborate than
this, with two or three
events, ’ Gaige said.

In_addition to the public
events, the festival will in-

ed by the ‘| administrators

programs in South Asia.

dress the festival at 10 a.m.

Dean of Students William
H. Terry had no comment on
the RHC’s action. “I would
not like to make any com-
ments at this time,’’ he said.

Cecil “Burney said that
further action would be up
to the administration. He
felt that the RHC had made
its position clear, and that
it was willing to stand by
its decision,

SGA Vice Prestdent’Bill
Alexander, the new chair-
man ‘of the RHC, said, ‘I
intend to support the deci-
sion of the RHC."’ Alexand-
er is to have & meeting with
Dean Terry in the near fu-
ture to discuss the matter
of open dorms.

Jody Turner, a member
of the (RHC. and the Studerit
Senate, believes that the
RHC will not back down
from its stand. He also ex-
pressed the opinion that if
this matter is brought up
before the Student Senate,
it will give a vote of con-
fidence to the RHC.

On February 4, the RHC,
under the chairmanship of
oufgoing RHC President and
SGA Vice President Cecil
Burney, voted to declare the
dormitories open to visitors
around the clock.

Previously the policy of
the RHC had been to negect
enforcement of. dorm hours
and see how open dorms
would work on an unofficial
basis before making the
round-the-clock plan offici-
al.

Coed Program .

Fails To

The coeducational — ex-
change program is alive and
well, though not growing.

The number of girls who
listed Davidson as. their
first choice ‘on exchange ap-
plications has gone down,
from eleven last year to se-
ven this year. The applica-
tions have spaces for first,
second, and third choices
from the schools participat-
ing.

J. ‘H. Ostwalt, who heads
the exchange program at
Davidson, said more appli-
cations were expected: .

‘Last year there were five
applicants from Davidson to
go to other schools. This
year, eight Davidson  stu-
dents are applying, all to
g0 to Hollins. If accepted,
the eight will probably live
together.

The eight, all sophomores,

’ are Bill Endy, Hy Lankenau,

‘Mike Lippard, Robert Mil-
ler, David Mims, Dave Sen-
gel, Dal€ Smith, and John
Wackman.

When asked why fe wae.
ed to go to Holtins, Wack-

Grow

man’s first fesponse was,
“Chicks.’’ He also wants to
take courses in geology and
film-making not offered at

, Davidson.

“Their curriculum is so
much better than ours, it’s
ridiculous,"’ said 'Wackman.
All the prospective ex-
changees want to-take ad-
vantage of the Hollins cur-
riculum, as well as the pro-
spects for female compan-
ionship.

David Mims emphasized

opportunities for ‘female
companionship” as opposed
to simply sex. ‘‘The main

reason I’m going” he said,
“is that Davidson's pervert-
ed. Hollins is all women,
and that’s perverted, too,
but .the only real solution
for both is coeducation.”’
Dale Smith said he- wished
to take advantage of the

_ Progressive English depart-

inent at Hollins, and to take
courses offered» there in
fine arts, psychology, and
Political science. He~ also.
said, ‘I’m going there main-
ly for the same reason.
everybody else is, and if
they don't say it’s sex

they're, lying.”’
