Monday Section of Eu Society
The Monday night section of the
Fu Society held its first meeting this

week. The subject for debate was,
“Resolved, that the United States
Should Establish a Protectorate

Over Mexico.”

Dick, L. W.. and Patterson, who
upheld the negative, won the de-
cision over Phillips and Lowry,
champions of the affirmative. Phil-
lips brought out Amerfca’s respon-
sibility in developing the resources
of Mexico, while his colleague

_Lowry showed our moral obligation

THE
COMMISSARY

to establish a protectorate over this
disorganized country.

Patterson’s main speech dealt
with the unfavorable light in which
the United States would be placed
by the taking over of Mexican prob-
lems, and Dick argued that Mexican
freedom would be violated.

The declaimer of the evening was
Patrick, who bravely — struggled
through a part of “The Old Ken-
tucky Home.” The oration render-
ed by Hollandsworth was decidedly
the best number on the program.
When he arose to give his original
preduction the orator had not yet
decided what its title was to be, but
in spite of its nameless condition the
audience was greatly pleased, and
much applause followed Hollands-
worth’s description of his experi-
ences in Paris on the night of the
signing of the peace treaty.

The society adjourned after the
usual warning of the treasurer con-
cerning unpaid dues.

JUNIORS LABORING
MANFULLY IN SPITE
OF SHAKY NERVES

Complete List of Speakers to be
Published Next Week.

With Junior Speaking only three
weeks off, the watchword of the
Junior class has changed from
“Have you written your speech?”
to “Have you learned your speech ?”

There will be 66 speakers this
year, the largest number since be-
fore the war. We suppose there will
be five groups of speakers instead of
the usual four.

Most of the subjects have been
chosen and Jim McKeldin is going
to order the invitations this week.

There are as usual quite a variety
of subjects. They range from “Our
Next President” to “Spiritualism,”
and from “Verba in Ventos” to
“Yamata No Miria.” J. G. Barnette
answers D. R. Freeman's “Is There
a Fountain of Youth?” with “The
Value of Athletics.” In answer to
Burgesse’s question, “What Does
Davidson Need?” there are several
theories advanced. E. H. Brown
says it is “The Iron Mule ;” Gaither
‘claims it is “Diligence;” Gaston

maintains it is “The Master Key,;”
Hill is in favor of “White Coal;”
Hodgin wants “The New Dawn;”
King would like to have “Billy Sun-
day” pay us a_ visit, while G. E.
Miley thinks that “Perseverance”
would be betier than anything else.
{t is hoped Davidson will get some
of these, but a swimming pool and a
new dormitory would he _ better.
Ormand’s subject “The Queerest
Thing in the World” is questioned
by Mitchell, who asks “Is It?” M.
A. Tremain takes for his title
“China,” while Miller would like to
know “Can She Come Back ?”

A full list of the speakers and
their subjects will be published next
week,

EU. SOCIETY INITIATES
NEW MEN-—-HUNTER
URGES PHI’S TO WAKE UP

C. K. Brown Entertains With Ora-
tion—Eu’s Program Not Up
to Standard.

Phi Society.

The Phi Society met in regular
debate Saturday night. The ques-
tion under discussion was: “Re-.
solved. That the U. S. should estab-
lish a protectorate over Mexico.”

Query, Russell, and McClure, ar-
gued for the affirmative, while Long,
Wilson, and Smith, W. C.. defended
the negative. Russell, for the affiirm-
ative, showed that both the U. S.
and Mexico would be benefited by
this protectorate. McClure, follaw-
ing him on the same side, maintain-
ed that this was an opportunity and
obligation to the U.S. Query sum-
med up the arguments of his col-
leagues.

On the negative, Long argued that
Mexico isn’t ready fot this protec-
torate, and she doesn’t want it. He
opposed said question also because
this is legislation by and for the
capitalists, who have great oil in-
terests down there. Wilson thought
the cast of establishing this protec-
torate prohibitive, and Smith stuted
that the U. S. already had enough on
its hands. The affirmative won the
decision by a 2-1 vote.

C. Hunter appealed to the society
to get the old “Phi Spirit.” and get
to doing things. He reminded the
Phis that the Eus now have. the de-
bating cup—the first time it has ever
passed out of the possession of the
Phi.

C. K. Brown entertained the so-
ciety in an enlightening oration on
the poem “The Old North State.”
He gave as the author (or au-
thoress) Mrs. Leonore Martin, of
Louisville. Ky. For any other infor-
mation as to the date, etc.. of “The
Long Leaf Pine” see Mr. Brown.

The extemporaneous affair was
staged by Lacy and Hill. The ques-
tion (supposedly) under debate was:
“Resolved, that Sunday breakfast
should he abolished.” Lacy had the
affirmative, Fill the negative. As to
decision, debate, etc., little is known.
Probably Lacy lost tho, for he was
out bright and early Sunday morn-
ing “looking chow.”

Eu Society.

The first section of the Eumenean
Society held its regular meeting on
Saturday night. On account of the
large number of members, it was de-
cided some time ago to have two
sections of the society, one to meet
on Saturday night and one on Mon-
dav night,

The program as a whole was not
up to the standard. one reason being
that several of the debaters were
appointed on extemporaneously.

The most interesting feature of
the meeting was the initiation of the
fotiowing new members: Bradley.
S. H.; Calhoun, A. B.: Gentry, E. T.;
McCutchen, George, and McCutch-
en, W. It. After the initiates had
exhibited their literary talents in
various ways the society adjourned
to attend the movies.

PROF. FULLBRIGHT’S
INSTRUCTION GREATLY
BENEFITS STUDENTS

Professor Fullbright left David-
son Monday after completing his
month’s work here. He went from,
here to Erskine, where he will aa

a course similar to the one he gave
the Freshman, English and Public

. Speaking classes, |

The Public Speaking class, and es-
pecially those would-be-speakers,
report much benefit from his lec-
tures. The Freshmen, while they
will not admit it, show marked im-
provement under Professor Full-
bright’s tutorship.

Professor Fullbright, in his short
stay here, has won the respect- and
admiration of the entire student
body. The best wishes of all go
with him in his work.
