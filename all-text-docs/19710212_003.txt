Millet Foresees Change "pg 2.

From Patriarchal Society

AN ANALYSIS

By RUSS MERRITT
Co-Editor-In-Claet

It all seemed incongruous.
(Many of the women in the
audience had brought along
their boy-friends and pin-
mates. A large contingent
of Davidson (and therefore,
male) students was scatter-
ed. throughout the crowd.
At least one SAE jacket was
in evidence.

And in the wings of the
Stage, preparing to speak to
the assemblage, was Kate
Millet, one of the most mili-
tant and renowned advo-
cates of the women's liber-
ation movement.

The setting was the
Queens’ Symposium, which
was held Monday and Tues-
day on the Queens College
campus.

The symposium, | entitled
“The _ American Woman:
Feminism-Femininity,"’ feat-
ured (Millet, the author of
the best-seller ‘‘Sexual Poli-
tics,"’ and Elizabeth Konntz,
director of the Women's
Bureau of the U.S, Depart-
ment of Labor.

At, first, it appeared that
members of the audience
were confused as to what
their roles and relationships
should be,

The males . didn't know
whether or ‘not. they should
bother to open the door to
the auditorium for ihe wo-
men, and the. females
couldn't quite decide if it
would be appropriate to call

Church

-Theologically, the Church
of the West seems to be in
a ‘‘state of relative helpless-
ness,” for few theologians
today have as many answers
as they do questions.

That is the  opinion,, at
least, of Dr. Dietrich: Ritsch],
the first legitimate interna-
tional theologian to visit -Da-
vidson in several years.

Ritschl, who is presently
on the theology faculty at
Mainz University in Ger-
many, has been professor at
Austin and Pittsburgh Theo-
logical Seminaries as well.

Speaking to an informal
gathering of over 40 people
Monday night, Ritschl said
hat he has a love for
America, but that his ‘‘emo-
tional and psychic contact
with this country has been
disturbed’? due to the war
in Vietnam.

The theologian said that

he still had guilt feelings ~

over being a German be-
cause of ‘‘the great injustice
that Germany has done to
others” in the past. ‘‘And
now I find myself associat-
ed with another country (the
United States) which causes
me to have guilt feelings.”
Shifting to a discussion of
the ‘state of theology in the
world today, Ritschl said

that theologians are asking |

questions and _ confronting
problems which ‘are in-

yolyed- with central issues, -

not those at the periphery.
“The church is facing the

some of the men present
“mele chauvinist pigs.”

The appearance of Ms.
Miilet On the stage, however,
seemcd to dissipate every-
one’s tensions. For the wo-
man that many had expect-
ed to be a bitter, violent
and aggressive feminist
turned out to be a very
warm, gentle ‘and enlighten-
ing human.

“We are in the midst. of a

“revolution, the sexual revo-

lution,’ she bégan. ‘This
sexual revolution is primari-
ly a profound change in the
status of the sexes in rela-
tion to each other.

‘We presently exist in a
patriarchal society,” she
continued, ‘‘in which every
avenue of power is control-
led by men, and men alone.
To change this situation of
male dominion and female
subjugation and to reach a
true point’ of egalitarian
sharing would be profoundly
revolutionary."

Yet this,.she said, is the
goal of the women's lib
movement. ;

“Actually, the movement
for women's ,Jiberation  in-
volves the liberation of men
as well,” Ms. Millet explain-
ed. . :

‘For men are as ‘oppres-
sed by the social demands

mn are, Neither males nor
females are allowed to ex-
h.bit personalijy traits nor-
ney re-erved for the op-
pose sex without being

problem of Teconciling its
historical, exegetical  activi-
ty with «the whole com-
plex of credal  affirma:
tions and -confessional state-
ments, or ethics,” Ritschl
said. Because of historical,
linguisitc, political, and cul-
tural barriers, ‘‘the Church
is divided all over’ the
world.

‘‘However, the fragment-

“ation of the Church has pro-

duced some new areas of
contact and confidence, and
so has had a positive side-
effect.”

Ritschl said that he felt
“Christians actually are a
very small crowd in this
world, and when the going

. gets tough it will become

even smaller. However, this
group will be much more
alive.

“TI think many today would
not really fight for what
their Protestant fathers,
fought for,’ Ritschl contend-
ed. “Yet in 20 years, things

One member of the audi-
ence made the observation
that Ms. Millet sounded a
lot like Marx or Engles must
have sounded many. years
ago.

for much of her feminist
theory revolved around her

basic assumption that we.

are involved in a class strug-
gle. And in her opinion
these classes are’ determin-
ed by sex,

Thus, she contended, ‘
heaval at the very roots gi
our lives, coming in the
form of challenge and final
rejection of the roles of
masculinity and femininity
and the methods of ’incul-
cation into the young."’ This
is essentially the  revolu-
tion, she concluded.

Lester Strong, recently
elected President of the Col-
lege Union, said that he is
“greatly impressed with the
group I'll be working with
in the coming year." He ex-
pressed his hope that the
year to come will be ‘‘a
banner year for Davidson
College."’

Asked whether the tradi-
tional three big social week-

«ends will be eliminated next
‘year, Strong said they would

not because ‘‘students like
big weekends so they can
have dates down. We may,

Helpless

may be very different.”

When questioned about
the meaning of being a
Christian, Ritch] said that
the ‘‘task of the Christian is
distinct from that.of another.
He is involved in doing;
which is also true of many
non-Christians.

“The Christian also prays
and worships, which shapes
and influences his doing and
sets him apart from _ non-
Christians.”

Ritschl said that a ‘‘theo-
logy of hope seems to be
the most fruitful and appro-
priate way of expressing the
relationship between the
actual on-going work of the
Church and Him who the
Church chooses to call Lord.”’

In his concluding remarks,
Ritschl said that it is ‘‘ex-
citing to be alive in these
times, and men should wel-
come the challenge. Chris-
tians in these days should
serve both as brakes and in
a catalytic function.”

however,
next year.”’
He expressed the hope that
social activities could be
spread out over more week-
ends so that something
could be going on every
weekend. Homecoming would
probably, remain a_ major
social event in any case,
Duff Bruce, chairman of
the Union Social ‘Council,
will be in charge of book-
ings for the Hungry d, the
Union Coffee. House, and
this year’s Spring Frolics.
Strong, who appoints the
members of thé Union
Board, — mentioned
very significant changes"
which he plans to make in
the personnel of the board.
The -first change will be
the appointment. of Wally
Kernodle as chairman of
the CoCurricular Council.
He will be responsible for
“co-ordinating educational
activities, and integrating
educational activities into
social contexts.” ;
Kernodle will manage the
lunch films series and the
art rentals, and he will also
organize symposiums’ on
subjects of interest to stu-
dents.
He will also work closely
with the Fine Films Series,
which is represented on the

Co-Curricular Council. Ker-
nodle will appoint the other
members of thee CoCurricu-

The second innovation will
be the nomination of Ray
Mendenhall to head the
Open End program.

Strong expressed the hope
that there can be an Open
End every week, including
one Open End a= month
which the students can use
as a platfokm for their own
program. The conscientious
objectors meeting of — last
spring’ was pdvinted out as
an example.

The third appointment will
be ‘Howard Daniel as Trea-
surer-of the Union Board.
Strong said that Daniel's
work will touch on matters
outside finance. He praised
Daniel’s experience and
said, ‘I hope to draw on his
experience in the coming
year."'

The ‘Hungry. d program
will be under Howard Rama-
gli, who according to Strong
thas °‘‘new ideas for the Hi
gry<d’’. and will be “very
effective in this. capacity.’
