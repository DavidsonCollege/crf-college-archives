THE WHOLE SEASON,

‘Taken as a whole, the season just past
is one of the most successful that David-
son has ever had. It cannot be called a
brilliant season, although there were
flashes of superb form. Rather were the
games played characterized by steadi-
ness, coolness, and determined fight on
the part of the little Red and Black
Machine, which Coaches Fetzer and
Harris whipped, with hard work, into
form.

The narrow victory in Charlotte last
Thursday, when Wake Forest displayed
surprising strength, was a disappoint-
ment to some, but no Davidson man or
alumnus has aught bat unstinted praise
for the splendid team which has fought
through the season of nine games with
onty one defeat. “Vhis record has never
been bettered at Javidson. — In only
three seasons before this one, has David
son come through with oniy one defeat,
and it: remains vet for her so establish
the record of a defeatless season. In
1900, 1904 and 1907, the Red and
Blacks lost to Clemson, V. M. I. and
A. & M.. while winning in every orher
game. In the wonderful 1910 season,
when North Carolina was vanquished,
Davidson lost to V. P. 1. and Washing-
ton and Lee. So, barring perhaps 1907,
when Davelson tied Virginia and) de-
feated V. M. 1., Clemson, and V. P. 1.
and 1910, when the “VFarheels | went
down before us, the tgig season has
been as fine as any since intercollegiate
athletics were begun here.

Considering Davidson's records for
the past fourteen years with the colleges
which were plaved this year, the season
stands out all the better. Clemson was
held to a tie this year.

The games with Clemson now stand:
Davidson won 2, tied 2, tost g. North
Carolina's score against Davidson this
year was by no means the largest ever
rolled up. In 1902 Davidson was de-
feated by her 27-0, when her team was
not ever classed with the other univer-
sities. Since 1900 North Carolina has
won 6 games from Davidson, tied 3, add
lost 1. Davidson is far ahead in her
record with South Carolina, having won
8 games from the university, while only
2 have been lost. Wake Forest has been
defeated 5 times, and has never won.
The University of Georgia was not
played this year, but it is to be hoped
that athletic relations may be begun
again with them. Georgia has defeated
Davidson once, tied her twice, and lost
to her twice.

Davidson has come through this year
with a large margin of points, with the
satisfaction of having won every game
but one, and of having held North Caro-
lina’s powerful eleven to two touch-
downs. Clemson defeated Georgia, and
Davidson held Clemson to a tie. South

foot ball season.

CONSTITUTION AMENDED.

. ely .
At a meeting of the student body in
Shearer Hall last Saturday morning aft-
er chapel, an amendment to Article I,

Section 7, of the Constitution of the|

Student Body, relating to the oath of
office required of members of the Stu-
dent Council, was passed. ‘The section
ts amended now reads as follows:
“Before entering upon the duties of
their offices, the above officers — shall
each cach take and subscribe to the fol:
lowing oath or affirmation; but no one
shall be allowed to take the affirmation

in preference to the oath unless he can,

show what shall in the estimation of at
least two-thirds of the Student Council
be considered a valid wand sufficient
reason:

"PE do solemnly swear (or affirm, as
the case may be) that I will, to the best
of my ability, perform the duties of the
office to which [| have been elected; that
I will neither charge anyone nor so far
as | can know encourage anyone to be
charged or tried from envy, hatred or
malice, nor shall | suffer anyone — to

escape the proper judgment ‘of the stu-’

dents’ council or student body, for fear,
favor, affection, reward, or hope of re-
ward, so help me God.”

‘The section as it now stands thus al-
lows anyone not wishing to use the form
“swear” because of religious scruples, to
take the affirmation; but in cach case the
concluding words, which are essential to

an oath, and which invoke ‘the Divine;

aid, are the same.

PEACE CONTEST
SATURDAY NIGHT

Next Saturday at 7:55 p.m, in
Shearer Hall, a preliminary Peace Con-
test will be held for the purpose of
