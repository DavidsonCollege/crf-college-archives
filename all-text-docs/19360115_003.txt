HONOR ROLL

Leroy Blackwelder and Charles Parker Chosen as Var-
sity Wrestling Stars by Gordon Woodward

By HARRY KUYKENDALL

Frosh and varsity

basketball took it
on the chin last week-end in the form of
a defeat at the hands of N. C. State's
ferocious Wolves as local fans wit
nessed a full program with four) Wi
cat teams occupying the sportlite. Our
old standbys, the wrestlers, saved the
day by defeating High Point “Y" much
the same as the Kitten grapplers trounced
their opponents, Salisbury High, Friday.

The most gratifying and com-
mendable performance of the en-
tire card was that staged by David-
son’s gymnasts extraordinary—
Gordon Smith, Lloyd Feuchten-
berger, John Templeton, Bob Blue,
‘and Elmore Holt.
The strength and grace with which
these men performed afforded a
delightful surprise to spectators;

Jerry Harris,

a, surprise that proved a refreshing
interlude to a disappointing game.

"CATS CLAW.

Another opponent of our feline friend
was banished Saturday afternoon when
the local grapplers clawed their way
through the High Poiit “Y" which
boasts, as well it should, of the services
of Parks, for over three years a Stati
Champion grappler. Parks pulled the
“tron man” stunt by taking on both
Andy Davis and Johnny Allen” pinning
them both

However, there are always: two. sides
to an argument and although it is not
sportsminlike to alibi, the fact remains

that because of the empty places left by

Bob) Blue and Howard) Summerell, who

dropped out on the Doctor's advice,
Davis was called upon to qualify for
the 118-pound class* which necessitated a
loss of S&S pounds in a few days. Thus;
by dropping into anothér weight class,
his vacancy in the 126 class had: to “he
filled by Johnny Allen who though in
experienced, has given promise of be
coming a real asset to the team. Davis
termed Parl f High Point being
“plenty wood” at the wrestling game
Another shake-up in the local team tinds
Joe Gamble at the position formerly oc-
cupied hy Johnson. Joe, howe , Was not
called upon Saturday as [igh Point for

feited Uns match
Parker and Captain Blackwelder
are easily the outstanding members
of the

against a seemingly stockier oppo-

present team. Parker
nent gave the spectators the usual
thrill by the

right off and by the use of some

starting fireworks

spectacular bits of strategy.

Blackwelder, in his initial mateh as
Captain of the team, did not belay the
confidence placed in him and proceeded
to give Shipman of High Point, a typical
stocky built wrestler, a defeat by pin-
ning him carly in the mateh

McFadyen was hard put to eke
out a decision over his opponent
after getting off to a bad start.
However, his long legs and arms
enabled him to escape from many
a dangerous situation eventually
to win his scrap. Crabb, a junior
transfer, has plenty of courage and
toughness, and may prove a real
fighter after more experience.

All we can say to comfort the basket

ball team is that they were up against
the future state champs (with the pos-
sible exception of Duke). The local lads
who played such a heads-up game
against Carolina, were ¢ertainly off
form.

A survey of the 34, men who have
captained University of Vermont foot-

ball teams reveals most of them are out-
standing successes.

Arle Davis of Oklahoma kicked 23
extra points from placement in one game
—Oklahoma vs. Kingfisher, in 1917. Bal-
ance sheet: Oklahoma 179, Kk. I. 0.
