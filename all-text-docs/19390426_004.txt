Nine Goes On Rampage!

Davidson bounced back up from the depths of basebail’s
mire last week-end as the nine nosed out Wake Forest 5-3 and
then went on the next day to completely subdue State 9-3,
Whereas the Cats have been receiving good pitching with
poor support from the infield on this trip there was only one
error committed; the remainder of the time the infield was
airtight as were the outer gardens also. No pitcher can go on
hurling good baljswhen he is continually disheartened by his
teammates’ mistakes. Dave McLean gave up eight hits while
his mates backed him up in fine fashion, making everything
count. The next day J. D. Hicks allowed 14 hits, but only three
runs crossed the plate and eight men were left stranded on the
sacks, while others were caught at the plate or at other bases
by alert fielding, Sam Hemphill’s return to the lineup no doubt
helped revive the ailing Cats, as he continually hustles around
the hot corner and holds one of the leading batting averages.
Sam played errorless ball all the way, but managed to get
only one base lick, handicapped by his split finger, which is
now enclosed in,a speeial metal cap. Both games came as sweet
revenge for earlier defeats suffered by the Cat§ in other sports,

With The Track Stars

The track team reports a “fine time was had by all” at the
University of Virginia on their week-end trip there. Showing
true southern hospitality the school secured permission from
local theatre owners for all the members of the Wildcat team
to visit the show free at any time during their two-day sojourn
there. President Roosevelt’s presence on the campus added
another touch. Perhaps the gala affairs were too much for
the track stars, for they went down 94-31 before the Gentle-
men from Virginia. Seriously though, the Virginians boast a
crack team, and it was no disgrace to be beaten by them, Sev-
eral of Davidson’s top men lowered their times and length-
ened their distances as they put out plenty, but couldn’t quite
top the ace performances of their rivals. Charlie Sample clear-
ed 12 feet two inches in the pole vault, just two inches more
than the week before. Captain Boo Walker kept his record
clear in the 880 as he again come from behind to win in the
stretch for the fourth time this season, The crowd of 3,000 on
hand saw the unique shuttle hurdle race in which two mem-
bers of each team raced up.a flight of hurdles, touched their
teammates and sent them racing back down the same flight.
It was an exhibition match, and Davidson borrowed a man to
run in it, but they showed up well in this rarely-seen race.
Here And There

The netters and golfers relaxed during the week, only one
match being played by the court squad, and none by the links-
men, The tennis team barely managed to keep their record
unblemished further, after one earlier loss, as they nosed out
Furman 5-4. Golf interest centered in practice rounds in prep-
aration for the State tournament to be held at Greensboro on
Thursday. That same day the tennis men take off to Raleigh
for the State tennis tourney there,

run in a hot game. At the halfway mark they still appear to be
headed for the championship,

defeated Davidson 94 3-4 to 31 1-4

were the competition between Vir-

a scant second behind Fuller in the
mile, and Goodall trailed Walker
by only two or three seconds in the

880.
