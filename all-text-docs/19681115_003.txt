_ The People
i Who Are

Davidson

Faces.

These are the faces of people Davidson
students see everyday, every week or at
least sometimes.

Some of these faces have only first
names, some only last names. And sqme
are nameless faces.

These people are Davidson. They are,
in a sense, as much a part of Davidson Col-
lege tradition as required assemblies, black
uinbrellas, Mid Winters and Chalmers Da-.
vidson.

Take a walk down Main Street, drive
to thé service station, order a tall Bud.
Davidson students know these people.

Down Main Street, Murray Fleming
pontificates over his toaster and the egg
salad. Tal], thin, methodical. one “M” of
the M & M Soda Shop.

And Mary Potts, the other ‘‘M.” the -
Mary of “Mary’s,” that Davidson colloquial-_ —
ism. Queen of the large orange, a master of
the witty comment.

A collage of faces. Ralph Quackenbush,
black hair and pipe, with an uncanny
memory for names. Ralph, The Hub, the
slick magazines, a carton of Winstons.

Then it’s Tuesday morning. Get a

7 haircut. Sit and wait. The taciturn, rarely
smiling Ralph Johnson. “Next gentleman, ccqauasenn
please.”

And at the post office, Bill Mayhew

stands in the back, behind the counter.

White shirt, tie, no coat. He watches you,

mark your absentee ballot. Meanwhile,

Miss Louise Sloan rummages through the

‘asl post office trash cans, gathers up news-
ammaneee oe papers, goes over to the library to read
more newspapers. Her hats, her trademark.

Again on Main Street, there’s Parks
Todd. Built like a football player. See him
at the door of the Methodist Church on
Sundays. Shake his hand, he recognizes
the face and doesn't know the name. Mut-
ter something about the sock-it-to-’em
sermon.

Drive down Main Street. Bub Cashion
at the Gulf station. Fill it with “Good Gulf.”

Back on Main Street. The black man
with no legs in the wheel chair. Greeted,
health enquired about, greeting returned.

At the cleaners, W. L. Jackson Jr.
Bow tie. Hat. Verbal irrelevances.

Drive up the road to Hattie’s. Hattie
Morgan Bumgarner and Betty Jo. The
little man who shuffles by the booth, clear-
ing it of cans and bottles. 11:45. The smell
of beer. Play the game machines. A bag of
popcorn. Hattie’s corned beef on rye.

Some people, some things are
ephemeral. But not these, these Davidson
traditions, these people and faces.
