DURHAM — It took Duke ex-
actly 2:50 to squash the men’s basket-
ball team’s grandiose visions of pulling
off a nationally-televised upset Thurs-
day night.

With 13:11 to go, a Stephen

Blue Dev-

ils’ lead to
eight points. Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski
called a 20-second timeout.

Whatever the | 8th-year coach said,
it worked.

In the ensuing 170 seconds, his
squad ripped off a 13-1 run, practically
instantanéously turning a tight battle
into an absolute laugher.

And with the fabled Cameron
Crazies and Duke's pressure defense
having finally taken its toll, the pro-
Blue Devil margin continued to bal-
loon, getting as high as-38 points (94-
56 with 2:43 left) en route to the final
100-65 count.

“Forty minutes against Duke is 40
minutes against players with an inten-
sity level you can’t simulate in prac-
tice,” Wildcat coach Bob McKillop said
in ‘the postgame press conference.
“They’re an extraordinarly talented
team.”

“Davidson’s a great team,” said
Elton Brand, one of the Blue Devils’
four vaunted rookies.

“Tt seemed like they stuck around
forever. They just fought for every-
thing. They actually played harder and
better than us in the first half.”

So what the heck happened?

“It was a combination of us wear-
ing them down and us picking up the
defensive pressure,” said All-ACC two-
guard and’ All-American candidate
Trajan Langdon.

Indeed, Duke forced 32 Wildcat
turnovers, which it converted into a
whopping 48 points.

“We just totally lost our poise and
made stupid mistakes,” Wildcat cap-
tain Mark Donnelly said.

“We did some good things that we
wanted to do. Just not for the last 13

After the game, Duke coach Mike

Krzyzewski lauded both Davidson
coach Bob McKillop and the program,
claiming that Duke had beaten “a very
good team” in “ a real battle.”

“It feels good that we beat such a
good team pretty badly,” Duke guard
Steve Wojociechowski said after the
game. “They are definitely a NCAA
team.”

Somehow Duke’s praise isn’t
enough.

Football squad finishes season with loss to South Florida

By Jack Morse

TAMPA, Fla. — Saturday’s sea-
son finale against South Florida pre-

sented the

é football

Duke : 100 team with
Wildcats 65 an atmo-
sphere it

had never encountered before — in

front of over 27,000 fans.

But from the onset, the Wildcat

footballers let everyone know that they
were not phased at all.

In the first series of the game, the
host Bulls had the ball at the Davidson
4Oyard line, and it was fourth down and
one. USF, looking to establish its po-
tent offense, went for it.

But Davidson defender Ryan Gist
busted through the line and drove Bulls
running back Raphael Williams to the
ground, giving the Wildcats the ball on
downs.

and an incomplete pass, quarterback
Tommy Dugan — who finished the
game with 50 yards passing and 67
yards rushing — saw a hole and ripped
off a 40-yard run.

Davidson placekicker Brian Lan-
gley took advantage of Dugan’s scam-
per, kicking a 27-yard field goal, as the
Wildcats took an early 3-0 advantage.

But then the Bulls showed exactly
why they are so good.

Behind the arm of Chad Barnhardt,

a transfer from South Carolina, and the

legs of Williams, the Bulls roared back
with four straight touchdowns en route
to a 28-3 halftime lead.

And South Florida, looking to
close its inaugural season with a vic-
tory, never let up.

With most of their -starters still
playing in the fourth quarter, the Bulls
kept pounding the ball downfield and
won the game 48-3. The 45-point de-
feat represented the first time this sea-
son the Wildcats fell by more than 14
points.

“I can honestly say that we are the
only team with a Division II schedule
that will come into this stadium and
play these guys,” coach Tim Landis
said. “I thought it was a great effort by
our guys. We played hard and never
backed down. They hardly ever put
their subs in.”

“Coming into this game, I said we
had to do three things — not turn the
ball over, use the clock, and establish
the option. They just answered every-
thing we did,”
