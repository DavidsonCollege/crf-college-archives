Your Gay & Lesbian Friends
Welcome You Back to School

ollege is a place where people learn

to respect others who differ from
themselves. It is for opening hearts and
minds and becoming enlightened to a

large and diverse world.

By the time you graduate, there is a good
chance one of your friends will tell you he
or she is gay. Being gay is not a choice,
but you can choose to accept and support

your friends at a time when they need you

‘most. When a friend comes out to you it
~* means he or she trusts you. Coming out is -

simply a matter of honesty.

Friendship, respect and trust are among

the important lessons you will learn while

you are here.
