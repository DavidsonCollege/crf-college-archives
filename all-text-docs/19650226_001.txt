Annual Tournament Fever Strikes Campus

By BOB ST

RAUSER

Davidsonian Feature Writer

The blue Volkswagen circled the campus
in the familiar February drizzle; inside, Dave
Powell—his face half hidden by a portable
speaker—announced the imminent departure
of Davidson’s greatest athletic team ever for
the Southern Conference Tournament. That
was Wednesday afternoon.

Little more than a day later the ’Cats
held an 86-73 first round win over VMI, West
Virginia stood in the wings—looking as omi-

nous as Coach George

King and 6-8 sharp-

shooter, Bob Camp could manage by word

and act.

Even more menacing, VPI had emerged
from the first round with an impressive romp
over the Richmond Spiders.

PARA,

Pages 4&5

But Wednesday afternoon, those prelimi-
nary questions went unanswered. At the

corner of Main and Co

ncord a pep rally of

sorts had been planned to convene under the
year-old banner announcing Davidson's par-
ticipation in the tournament.

Committee Considers

Suggested

By WALT DRAKE
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Several proposals calling
for changes in the fraternity
system have been submitted
to the Student Council Fra-
ternity Evaluation Commit-
tee by interested parties and
have been receiving the con-
sideration of the committee.

No rush being held by any .

fraternity in 1965 and sopho-
more rush being initiated in
1966 are basic tenets of one
of those proposals. However,
eating clubs could be formed
which would conform to such
regulations as membership re-
quiring approval of not more
than one-half of the members,
no discrimination as to race
and religion, and a 70-mem-
ber quota. Also, eating clubs
could consider members of oth-
er clubs who wished to change
membership at the beginning
of each semester.

Lingle Manor would remain
in existence with the addition
of boarding facilities and there
would thus be offered “an open
membership eating club for
those not in the majority-mem-
bership eating clubs or the
fraternities.”

A college social council would
be established to regulate all
social activities, and the IFC
would be abolished. Freshman
having a 1.5 average or better
would be a‘lowed to keep cars
on campus after Thanksgiving.
Rush week would be held on
Friday, Saturday. and Sunday
of the first week of each semes-
ter.

ALTERNATE PROPOSAL

A second proposal being an-
alyzed by the comniittee would
eliminate formal rush week
and institute sophomore rush.
All freshman would eat in the
college unton for one year. No
later than Fall, 1966, an eat-
ing club would be established
with facilities fully comparable
to those of fraternities.

Each student would be charg-
ed a social fee which would be
allotted to a campus-wide
social committee and the col-
lege union. Freshman ciass
activities would be promoted.

No discrimination by frater-
nities on the basis of race or
religion would be tolerated.
Bach fraternity would be te
“quired to sign a nondiscriml-
nation agreement each year and
would be required to sudmit to
the college a written agreement
from national fraternities that
they will not reject a chapter's
nominees on the oasis of race
or relig:on. Fraternities not
conforming to those rules would
be abolished.

Clubs could be formed with
membership by random assign-
ment or some system allowing
choice on the part of the stu-
dent. Membership quotas would
be employed.

FROSH OUT

A third proposal cites the pre-  reation,

Changes

“in accord with the Christian,
humane, and educational as-
pirations of Davidson College.”
Therefore, it would propose
that there be no formal re-
lationship between freshmen
and upper class social organi-
zations.

A social program for the
freshman would be planned by
the Freshman Council, with ath-
letic competition organized a-
round dormitories. An admin-
istrative staff member would
be employed by the college to
help the freshman adjust to
college life and pursuits.

Clubs would replace the
social fraternities and occupy
the fraternity houses. The rec-
reation, esocial life and intra-
mural competition would be or-
ganized around the clubs. A
Social Council would plan all
campus-wide social events, and
all students would contribute
to the budget of the Council
through a social fee assessed
by the College.

‘Under this plan fraternities
could continue, but menibership
would be limited to juniors
and seniors. All Davidson stu-
dents would have to be official-
ly eligible for consideration.

The chilling wind blew through the holes
cut in the banner; by the appointed hour, half-
a-dozen people stood under Cashion’s awn-

ing trying unsuccessfully to look nonchalant.

Then came Shaw Smith

sponded by crossing the street to take the
ever-present portable speaker in hand.

Fred allowed that the team wanted this
one bad and forwarded the hope of the team
to have the title in hand on returning to
campus. Driesell followed Hetzel and noted
that he could add little to Fred’s remarks.
The team departed, somewhat ungloriously,
as Essex droned damply, “. . Give mea D.. .!”
Tonight at 7:30 the spectacle begun on
Concord continues as the ‘Cats face West
Virginia again under the familiar lights of the

Mountaineers promise a show and possibly
a tragedy for the wary ’Cats.

The complete report of the

North Carolina’s Senate

town of Mooresville to hold
a retail liquor store election.

The dill, introduced in the

that chamber on Friday.

It provides that the Moores-

may order a special election
on the liquor store proposi-
tion, and that an election
must be held if 15 per cent
of the town’s qualified voters
petition for the referendum.

If a special election is call-
ed, and the measure passes,
the establishment of a liquor
store would represent a Sav-

part of North Mecklenburg resi-
dents and provide a source
of revenue for the town of

| into some feasible recomtmenda-
tions.

Rick Von Unwerth, IFC Pres-
ident and committee member,
commented on the social situa-
tion at Davidson. ‘The problem
is three-fold.

“First, there is the vaunted
rejection of those outside the
system: secondly, a social dicho-
tomy exists on campus, with so-
cial facilities available to some
and denied to others by virtue
of the fact that they are outside
of the social system; and third-
ly, there is the insidious prob-
lem facing boys accepted by the
system who allow it to dictate
their attitude towards a David-
son education, the student body.

Wind Ensemble
To Play Tuesday

Davidson College's Wind En-
semble, under the direction of
Dr. Grier M. Williams, will pre-
sent a program in chapel Tues-
day.

The group will present selec-
tions used on its tour over the
semester break. Included are a
clarinet concerto by Dick Vines
and two selections on the
marimba by David Hoag.

Several tunes marches, and a
Spanish selection will also be
presented.

and the goals of the college.

“These three, I believe, are
inextricably interwoven and are
part and parcel of tbe present
fraternity situation.”

The committee’s decision in
von Unwerth's opinion is
“whether to direct efforts to-
ward ameliorating the situation
or to eliminating the problerh.”

Members of the committee
have claimed that the Davidson
system is a caste system, and
the question arises whether this
situation is healthy or permis-
sible. Records indicate that the
large proportion of the students
who drop out of Davidson are
independents or those outside
the social system.

“It is hard to deny that the;
campus. is divided by formal
lines of demarcation into ‘in’

RICK VON UNWERTH

and ‘out’ group relationships,
however vague the line may.
be.” said von Unwerth in speak-
ing of the social situation.

“Most men in fraternities,” he
continued, “realize a great deal
of good in belonging in a frater-
nity group and that the type
of association is beneficial. It
is also apparent that there are
a good many disadvantages to
those doth inside and outside the
sytem as well as to the college.
The problem then is whether
the social system can realize
its potential for good without
faling into an unhealthy caste-
type situation.”

Yon Unwerth stated, “Some
members of the committee feel
that with some modifications in
the current systema healthy
cond'tion could exist. Others feel
that the individual [raternity is
considerably detrimental, and
that the very existence of frater-
nities and the fraternity system
is the basis of the problem
without the elimination of the
fraternity system as we know
it now."
