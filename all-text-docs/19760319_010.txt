Energy discusse

change predicted

By ANNE PELFREY

Although energy reserves continue
to decrease with time, the growing
lack of reserves will not change our
life styles too much, according to
Richard Lilly, General Manager for
Marketing of Exxon Corporation.

“There will be no drastic change in
life style, but people will probably
spend a little more money on energy
consumption. Prices will go up at
about the same rate as inflation.

‘Automobiles will be made smaller
and lighter, but there will be no
extensive changes,”’ said Lilly in an
interview, Wednesday, March 10.

Yet Lilly pointed to the growing
problem of unavailable reserves.

‘In 1954, with price controls, there
were 23 years of reserves. Five years
later, there were 21 years of reserves.
In 1974, there were 11 years left of
reserves. You can see we've been
aware of the problem for some time,”’
he said. sek

It seems, however, that until fairly
recently, the public knew little about
this shortage. Why?

“It’s the politicians. The problem
hasn’t slipped up on them either.
They’re saying that you can’t con-
tinue to control energy prices. They’re

not uninformed. It’s a sheer case oI
political expediency.

‘‘In New England, for example,
people are not going to vote for a
higher gas price, when they know
they have enough gas for a few more
years.

“Politicians think solely about the
next election. We can only hope
public opinion will push elected repre-
sentatives where they will take more
informed positions,” Lilly said.

Still much distorted information
about energy is publicized, according
to Lilly.

“TI read somewhere that the U.S.
consumes 30 ‘percent of the world’s
energy, even though the U.S. has
only six percent of the world’s popula-
tion.

‘But the article failed to include the
fact that the U.S. makes 30 percent of
the world’s GNP. That’s what uses
the energy,” he said.

Many comparisons of the U.S. to
Europe in energy consumption are
invalid, according to Lilly.

‘Eastern Europe has a more stable

climate than the U.S. The highest ©

temperature is around 84 degrees in
England,” he said.

Lilly added that Eastern European
industry often uses more energy per
unit if it is government-owned.

Jackson chases Democratic nomination

“TAM |

By SCOTT REID
Senior News Editor

Presidential candidate Henry
(Scoop) Jackson considers himself to
be a ‘‘hardnosed’’ conservative on
issues concerning freedom and U.S.
foreign policy, and a liberal on most
domestic issues such as economics
and civil rights.

The grey-haired, short U.S. Sena-
tor from the state of Washington was
one of the very first of the Democratic
presidential hopefuls to declare his
candidacy, doing so at a luncheon in
Washington, D.C., nearly fourteen
months ago.

In this way Jackson has followed
the example of George McGovern four
years ago and, like McGovern, his
campaign organization has been firm-
ly established. Another consequence
of Jackson’s early start has been that
he is one of the financially=best-off
candidates in the race.

Jackson has been insisting that
detente is a one-way street far longer
than any of his fellow Democratic
contenders, and led the fight in the
Senate to bar the passage of the Fair
Trade agreement with Russia.

In 1974 Kissinger worked out the
Fair Trade serccment with the Rus-
sians, but when the bill came before
the Senate, Jackson had an amend-
ment added that prohibited the U.S.
from cooperating in the agreement if
the Russians did not ease immigra-
tion restrictions on Soviet Jews.

The agreement, which would have
given the Soviet Union a ‘“most-fav-
ored-nation’’ status when trading
with the U.S., failed when the Soviets
refused to cooperate with the so-called
‘Jackson Amendment’’.

Because of his strong stand for
freer immigration of Jews from Rus-
sia, Jackson did well in Florida’s

primary, especially among Miami-
area Jews who gave him over &0

perceive us enelr votes.

A large percentage of the $5 million
Jackson has raised in campaign funds
so far is estimated to|have come from
Jewish sources.

As acounter to the USSR, Jackson
proposes stronger relations with
China including the opening of an
embassy in Peking. He would also
reduce the embassy in Taiwan toa
liaison oftice.

Jackson believes the most impor-
tant issue in this election is the
economy. He has said that ‘‘jobs will
be the centerpiece of the Jackson
Administration’”’.

He supports public works programs

and other kinds of pump-priming to
ease unemployment. He is for lower-
ing interest rates and would ‘control
domestic oil prices. He also wants to
rebuild railroads using federal money.

Jackson is strongly supported by
labor because he is in favor of cutting
tax breaks presently given to multi-
nationals. Other tax reforms he would
make include a raising of the mini-
mum a person can be taxed and a
sliding scale of taxation of capital
gains, less taxes being levied the
longer the capital is invested.

In the area of energy, Jackson
believes that federal funds should be
loaned to companies exploring for
energy sources and believes the U.S.
Government should do drilling for oil

on the outer continental shelf.

The presidential candidates appear
to divide into two camps on en-
vironmental issues: those who see
present laws as overly restricting
economic activities (Ford, Wallace),
and those who think that present laws
must be strictly enforced and addi-
tional statutes should be enacted
(Carter, Jackson, Udall). An addi-
tional statute Jackson would like to.
see would restrict strip mining.

Jackson has clearly come out
against involuntary busing. In this
position he is probably second only to
Wallace. He has a bill before the
Senate now that would change the
busing situation in two ways.

The first thing the bill would do is
establish special three-judge courts to
decide all busing cases. The judges
would have to consider whether
busing would lead to a further flight
of whites, as it often has, and a
number of other criteria before order-
ing busing in any area.

The bill would also authorize $1
billion over the next two years for
alternative methods of ending schooi
segregation. With this bill Jackson
feels that he is ‘‘making it clear that !
am against busing and for integra-
tion.”

Jackson was known throughout the
Viet Nam War for his staunch
support of pro-war activities. This is a
position for which more liberal Demo-
crats have never forgiven him. Their
fear of his hawkishness on defense
and foreign policy may prove to be the
single largest obstacle to his getting
the Democratic nomination.

Jackson’s health is generally con-
sidered ‘“‘excellent’”. He does suffer
fromechronic nasal stuffiness, and is
allergic to adhesive tape, straw-
berries, eggs. wool, and plated gold.
