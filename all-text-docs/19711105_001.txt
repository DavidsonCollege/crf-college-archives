Clodfelter Questions Article
In New Trustee By-Laws

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

Student Body President Dan-
ny Clodfelter expressed concern
over the tone and some _ spe-
cifics of the newly-adopted trus-
tee by-laws in a letter written
this week to Board Chairman
Warner L. Hall.

Clodfelter referred — specific-
ally to the new section (Article
VI) of the by-laws which deals
with the chartering and opera-
tion of faculty and student or-
ganizations.

Concerning section 1, which
Says that all faculty and _ stu-
dent constitutional documents
must be approved by the trus-
tees, Clodfelter asked whether
such constitutions are now _ in-
valid, or does the constitution
remain in force pending Board
action of further recommenda-
tion from the governance com-
mittee.

He also expressed puzzlement
as to why this provision was
included when in no other _por-
tion of the by-laws or in any
other document does the board

recognize the SGA as an of-
ficial body with its own area
of delegate authority.

“Rather than clarifying the
status of the SGA on campus,
the provisions of section 1, only
serve to further confuse an al-
ready impossibly complex au-
thority structure,’ Clodfelter
said.

Concerning Section 2, which

allows the president to suspend
action of any student or faculty
organization, Clodfelter said he

* could not understand why the

president should have such au-
thority over a constituted group,
if their action is within the
powers granted to that group.

Or if this section is to be
taken to mean that all power
en campus centers in the pres-
ident or remains residual with
the president,
this ‘‘violates every notion of
shared authority on the campus
and creates potential dangers
against which there are pre-
sently no guarantees save good-
will.”

Speaking to the final section
in article VI which subjects in-
itial chartering of all campus
organizations to apprvoal of the
president, Clodfelter said, ‘‘this

. strikes me as particularly
abhorrent in giving the power
to open or close the campus to
an organization to one man
without further specifying the
conditions under which charters
are granted and the process
which must be follawed in sus-
pending such charters.”

“Particularly sensitive .. . is
the issue of the independence
and freedom of student publica-
tions,” Clodfelter said, “I know
that in the past there have
been expressions of disapproval
of THE DAVIDSONIAN in par-
ticular and while I’m not im-
puting any serious intentions
here, I can only be uneasy
about the absence of guaran-
tees which in extraordinary cir-
cumstances might prove neces-
sary.”

Clodfelter expressed fear of

the failure of campus constitu-
ences to understand the new

Clodfelter said:

by-laws in the midst of present
campus turmoil involving cam-
pus governance. ‘‘For this rea-
son alone I would question the
wisdom of passing the new by-
laws at this time,” he said.

“What I am really saying is
that more than anything else
the changes imbodied in Article
VI are inopportune and im-
politic,” ke said.

Clodfelter’s Statements are
the second blast which the trus-
tees have received this week
concerning the newly-adopted
by-laws. The faculty Tuesday ex-
pressed similar questions re-
garding the broad powers giv-
en to the president.

Building and Grounds Commit-
tee also failed to meet the
three-fourths requirement.

The first reading of a third
amendment which would have
allowed student attendance at
faculty meetings failed even to
get a majority vote.

However, Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M. Be-
van, who chaired the meeting
in the absence of the president,
indicated that faculty concern
over the appointment of two
professors to the governance
committee may have influenced
the previous votes.

‘‘When we came to these ap-
pointments on the agenda, I
made a statement of what I
understood to be the function
of the Governance Committee,
and I read the definition of the
committee as defined by the
trustees,” Bevan said.

‘Following my _ presentation,
Dr. Brinkley made a prepared
presentation,” Bevan continued.
‘After deliberation it was mov-
ed to table the motion to ap-
point the professors to the com-
mittee. This motion was adopt-
ed.

“It*was felt that the implica-
tions uf discussion of total col-
lege governance was a matter
of deliberation at a time when
the president is here,” Bevan
said.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. had left for India
Tuesday, where he will finalize
plans for the Baroda University
program.

‘‘Many faculty members also
felt that they should look at
the total academic governance
before they make individual
changes,”’ Bevan said.

consideration of the co-curricu-
lar board proposal, another
amendment to the constitution,
and without considering the re-
port from the honorary degrees
committee.

Bevan said he felt the meet-
ing was a “healthy airing of
points of view and differences,”
and he said the faculty will
consider the appointments when
the president returns later this
month.

Student Body President Dan-
ny Clodfelter expressed disap-
pointment over the faculty’s ac-
tions. ‘‘It is unfortunate that
our proposals had to be the
basis for their debate on cam-
pus governance,” he said.

“But I think we have got to
see the failure of these amend-
ments to pass in the context of
the question concerning the gov-
ernance committee.

“We will try to reach a re-
solution on some of the doubts
raised on campus governance
and then come back to these

specific concerns,” Clodfelter
Said.
During the debate on _ the

Governance Committee issue,
Associate Professor of Philoso-
phy Alan Brinkley presented a
report in which he declared that
“Davidson College has_ been
seized by a _ severe crisis of
confidence.”

“Recent events have made it
clear that the trustees of David-
son College do not have con-
fidence that the members of
the faculty are qualified to
Share responsibility in the gov-
ernment of the college,” Brink-
ley said.

EPC Changes Exam Period
To Wednesday-Saturday

By DON PARMAN
Editor-in-Chief

Don’t trust the Davdison Col-
lege Catalog.

At least don't trust the cal-
endar which is printed in this
years book. Actions taken by
the faculty’s Educational Policy
Committee have changed the
examination period from the
dates listed in the catalog.

Examinations are now set to
run from November 17, a Wed-
nesday, to November 20, a Sat-
urday. There will be no pre-
exam study day, although a
student may choose to take one
under the self scheduled exam-
ination policy.

Revelation of the change has
provoked considerable dissatis-
faction among the student body,
many of whom had planned on
the scheduled period which was

to run through Tuesday, Nov-
ember 23.

Among the complaints are
those that students with three
exams have little time for study
between their examinations and
the football game on Saturday.
The football players will not
be able to take exams on Sat-
urday, creating a three day
exam period for those involved.

Senior Jody Turner, student
member of the EPC, raised a
question over the examination
schedule at last week’s EPC
meeting. His motion for an ex-
tension to include November 22
in the period died from lack of
a second.

Sophomore Doug Brown, the
other student representative,
did not second the motion. ‘I
was not aware of any dissatis-
faction on the part of the stu-

dents with regard to the exam-
ination’ period. ['m sorry to
find that t&ese conditions exist,”
said Brown.

Turner stated, “I used the
football team as an example
of the sort of problem that
many students have with the
present schedule. The thinking
of the committee seemed to be
that the cost of keeping the
physical plant open and the
cost of conducting the exam-
inatiqns was too high for the
20 or 30 students who usually
take the exams the last day.”

With this issue, The
« Davidsonian ceases publi-
= cation for the fall term.
