KA’S recapture flickerball crown

By BAD BERNARD
AND HOGMAN

The week of November 14th
will be remembered for two
things. First, it was during
this that Huk Kim, a 4’ 11”
junior out of South Pago
Pago, Maryland, realized he
had a chance to produce a
record breaking 0.00 GPA for
fall term. ‘

In attempting to duplicate
the win percentage of the DC

in season’s first W.C. meet

By TOM NIBLOCK
Staff Writer

The Davidson Rifle Team
upped its record to 6-1.Nov. 5
with big wins over Clemson,
Wake Forest, South Carolina
State, Presbyterian, and Wof-
ford.

The scene was the season’s
first Western Carolina Confer-
ence meet, hosted by David-
son. The Cats only loss was to
the top ten ranked team from
Appalachain State.

High shooter for Davidson
was senior Tom Miller, post-
ing a 266 (out of a possible
300). Sophomore John Par-
ham was close behind with a
very solid 264.

Junior Katherine Whitney,
and sophomore Mike Pearson
posted 254 and 240 respective-
ly. Rounding out the top five
was junior Tom Niblock with a
231.

Other Davidson shooters
were sophomores Robbie Kirk-
endol and Louis Williams at
229 and 214.

Three freshman shooters,
Reed Ellis, Mancy Cornwell
and Ruth Ann Westervelt shot
212, 204, and 196, respective-

ly.

It was a day for surprises as :

the Cats registered their first

soccer team, Huk (Eugene)
said, ‘‘American people will
not appreciate just what I
have done.
difficult to make 3 F’s as to
make the 3 A’s.”

A Bad Bernard-Hogman tip
of the rice cap to Huk for that
record shattering perfor-
mance.

While records were being
smashed in the classroom,
heads were being smashed on

win over Clemson University
in several years, shooting
below their potential. David-
son is already well on the way
toward breaking last year’s
18-8 win-loss record.

The Rifle Team won its
traditional season opener a-
gainst N.C. A&T on October
29.

The Rifle Team has been
concentrating on developing

-

It is just as

the flickerball field. When the
dust and smoke had cleared,
the KAs had marched away
with their second straight
Flickerball crown.

The tournament epitomized
the gallant pageantry of flick-
erball: warm, beautiful au-
tumn afternoon, dazzling uni-
forms of the KAs, luscious
Queenie cheerleaders mutter-
ing incoherent cheers for their
SAF heroes, piss poor offici-
ating, sell-out crowds and
overall imcompetent manage-
ment from Graeme Thompson.
The SAE’s played the role of
the dynamic upsetters as they
gatored past the Bongs and
the KA’s into the finals.
Meanwhile, the Bongs, Mac-
Fleet, and the KA’s battled it
out in the loser’s bracket for
the right to meet the boys

from the beach.
The KAs emerged victori-

_ ous and faced the almost

impossible task of beating the
Es twice in the finals.

The KAs came out firing in
the first game and walked
away with a 30-13 victory.
Mike Schaefer, Kenny Bell,
Stuart Boswell and Fly Wil-
liams spearheaded a tough
defense that contained the
explosive E offense, headed by
tailback Jim Richards.

A dejected Richards reflec-
ted to Bernie the feelings of
the team after the game when
he said,

the depth of talent that is
essential to consistent success
in any sport. A strong field of
dedicated freshmen and soph-
omores assure Davidson con-
tinued success in the years to
come.

The Team's next match will
be the second Western Caro-
lina Conference meet, this
Saturday at South Carolina
State at Orangeburg, S.C.

The stage was thus set for
the final game of the season.
Behind the clever mind of Stan
Brown, the Es headed down to
the Barn to alter their offense
and defense so as to confuse
the regimented KA patterns.

The KAs, riding the experi-
ence of four flickerball finals in
a row, remained lackadaisical
in their attitude toward the
game and held a brief prayer
service to Robert E. Lee.

Playing before a packed
house (standing room only) of
34,354 on Field #1, the KAs
utilized a late-in-the-game
touchdown catch by Schaefer
and two key interceptions by
George Flowers and Stuart
Boswell to take the Champi-
onship, 19-13.

‘Hell, I hada term ie Teper

Shooters blast all comers

for their victory __

A Laurel and Hardy hand-
shake goes to the Needle Dix
for their sterling performance
in the three on three basket-
ball tournament. Bob “I Can
Durk”’ Lapple, Rob “I Was A
Davidson JV Reject” Murray,
and Tim ‘‘Big Red’’ Goodell
nipped a tough SAE team
composed of Adrian Wilson,
Stan Brown and Chip Bondu-
rant. The winning triplet uti-
lized a tough four corner
offense to take the champion-
‘ship 21-13.

The game wasjdelayed only
once when Tim Goodell was
beeped to go rescue Rush Otey
who had swallowed his tongue
during a Tuesday night
Thanksgiving service.

Don’t forget that next week
marks the appearance of the
first annual Bernie-Hogman

Basketball Yearbook. This
year’s edition contains all the

Until then, would somebody
please feed Butch? Later.
