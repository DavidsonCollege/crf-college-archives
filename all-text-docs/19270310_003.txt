proached ‘him and politely inquired: “Are
you a young farmer living near here?” |
Which proves the old adage: You can get |
the boy out of the country but you can’t
get the country out of the boy.”

Camel is the sateen smoke

CAMEL is always the friendly ciga-

tette.

In days of tense achieve-

anent, in moments of joy and
gaiety, a lighted Camel will spur
you to the stars’with its cool,
crisp fire. Camels understand your

every mood.

A purchase of Camels brings

you the choicest Turkish and
Domestic tobaccos. Blended by

skilful .experts into the. world’s

most popular smoke, and the best. :

Unfathomed quality is the distin-
guishing mark of Camel.

No matter what the price you
pay, you can buy no better ciga-
rettes than Camels. Smoke them
as frequently as you please. You
will never be left with a cigaretty
after-taste; Camels aren’t made
that way. That is why experienced
smokers everywhere demand them.
That is why millions thrill to three
short words: “Have a Camel!”
