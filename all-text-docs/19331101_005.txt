WATTS AND GEORGIA
IN ANNUAL CLASSIC

RA CASKIE NORVELL 32.

The ’Cats and the ’Pack gave
the crowd thrills last week when
they played to a 6-6 tie in the an-
nual)Dad’s Day game at N. C.
State. State came from behind to
tie when McQuage’s touchdown
cancelled Mackorell’s scoring gal-
lop. This column had picked a Da-
vidson victory, but is quite content
with the result, as State has one of
the most potentially great elevens
in the Southern Conference.
Orchids this week go to the entire

team, Captain Rives, McElrath, Pot-
ter, Morgan, Windham, Hand, Siewers,
Mackorell, Wingfield, Hutchins,» Will-
son, Cathey, Lee, Fort, Grant, and Le-
Gare. °

Davidson has no varsity or fresh-
man games this coming week-end,
so the gridiron interest centers on
the inter-dormitory imbroglio, on
the eve of which this column goes
to press. Watts is to play Georgia
in the annual classic Tuesday aft-
ernoon,

So much has been said in the papers
about Duke playing their second team
against Davidson, and that this was
what held them to a two-touchdown
victory. May we say at this time that
available statistics on the game showed
that the Wildcats also used their sec-
ond team, fourteen substitutions being
made by each team.

Wimpy Ravenel, Davidson reserve
quarterback, crashed the limelight
by placing a well-aimed boot into
the water pail on the field the other
day. He claims he aimed at the
bucket, and maybe he did. Any-
how, the question has been raised
by several North Carolina papers
as to whether or not you could say
“the kicked the bucket.” Let’s hope
not.

Special attention should be called to
the splendid punting of Johnny Mack-
orell, Wildcat field general, and potent
candidate for all-state honors. In the
Duke game Mackorell averaged 37.5
yards, one of his boots travelling over
60 yards.

There were some notable upsets
in the football world last Satur-
day, and the old prognosticator
suffered accordingly. His average
dropped from .842 to .761 as a re-
sult of four defeats in last week's
predictions, the ties being knocked
out, as is customary.

We picked some long shots, such as
Washington and Lee over Princeton,
and the Generals more than held their
own, and though beaten 6 to 0, dis-
played a better brand of ball than the
Tigers. The Pitt-Notre Dame fracas
went against us, as we again took a
chance on a long one.

A lot of games were ties, notably
the Vanderbilt-L. S. U. contest,
that between West Virginia and
Davis-Elkins, and the Furman-
Mercer game. Another heart-
breaking loss was Alabama's bow-
ing to the highly-touted Fordham
Rams, 2-0.

Two games the old boy picked in
direct opposition to other sports writ-
ers of the state came out as he pre-
dicted. We refer to the Catholic U.-
Wake Forest game and the V. P. L.-
South Carolina fray. The Gamecocks,
playing their second game within 50
hours, spanked the Gobblers, 12-0, and
went into a tie with Duke as leaders
of the conference.

The choices for this week are
listed below, with the Ed’s choice
in CAPITALS, and though we pick
some long shots, we don’t bet on
them and wouldn't advise you to
do so either. Here they are:

DUKE vs. Auburn.

N. C. STATE vs. North Carolina.

CLEMSON vs. Wake Forest.

CARNEGIE TECH vs. Purdue.

PRESBYTERIAN vs. The Cita-
del.

FURMAN vs. Wofford.

GEORGE WASHINGTON vs.

GEORGIA TECH vs. Vanderbilt.

OHIO STATE vs. Indiana.

GEORGIA vs. Florida.

PITTSBURGH vs. Centre.

L. S. U. vs. South Carolina.

Gullette Leads Harriers Over
Hard Course in Fast Time

FRAZIER UNABLE TO RUN

Davidson Places Six Men in First
Ten

A powerful cross-country team from
Davidson continued its thus far suc-
cessful season last Saturday when it
travelled to Raleigh and defeated the
State harriers on a hard 3.5-mile course
by the lopsided score of 19 to 39.

Led by Gullette, the Wildcats were
able to pldce six runners among the
first ten, this being the entire Davidson
team, since Frazier, the Davidson num-
ber one man, was unable to compete,
due to a bad cold..

The course was run in the clocked
time of 19 minutes, 40 seconds, which,
considering the extra length of the
course, is rather fast,

The State team is being coached
this year by Red Lewis, whom most
followers of track will recognize as
the member of the 1933 Duke team,
and who set such a fast pace in the
mile event during that season last year.

The order in which the runners fin-
ished, and the points scored was as
follows: Gullette (Davidson) 1, Oakes
(Davidson) 2, Merchant (Davidson) 3,
Fallon (State) 4, Smith (State) 5, Mc-
Fadyen (Davidson) 6, Glass (Davidson)
7, Morrow (Davidson) 8, (points did
not count in team scoring), Floyd
State) 9, Boonous (State) 10, and Hines
(State) 11.

The Davidson harriers present this
year the strongest team which has
represented the school in ° several
years, and gives fair promise of being
able to go through its season unde-
feated, since it tied the Duke team on
the Homecoming Day meet.
There will be a-meet held on Friday
the Davidson with the
strong Washington and Lee team, led
by Ralph Dunaj, furnishing the oppo-
sition to the Davidson runners. Later
in the season there will be meets with
the University of Virginia, the Win-
ston-Salem All-Stars, and possibly with
the University of North Carolina.

All-Americans to Play Hunters-

The Davidson “B” team, popularly
known as the All-Americans, is ex-
pected to meet the Huntersville All-
Stars next Friday afternoon on Rich-
ardson Field. The probable line-up is
as follows: Ends, Newton and Young;
tackles, McClung and Cathey; guards,
Hodgins and Blackwelder; center, Bar-
ringer. The backfield men are John-
son, Casali, Faison, and Slaughter.

Substitutes: Rachal, Rogers, Lay,
and Garrett. The average weight of
the line is 165 pounds; of the back-
field, 150.

On November 17th, the “B” team
meets Mountain Park Junior College,
also on this field. The All-Americans
have been practicing Citadel's plays in
order to run them against the varsity

ext week, and so will use them in the
pee Friday.

The “B” team has the distinction of
never having been beaten, and it is
hoped that these games will not mar

their record. |

Mackorell Scores for Davidson on
85-yard Gallop

The Davidson Wildeats battled North
Carolina State to a 6-6 tie at Raleigh
Saturday in a hard-fought game. With
the score deadlocked at the half, 0-0,
Davidson took the lead in the third
quarter when Johnny Mackorell inter-
cepted a pass on the Wildcat 15-yard
line and raced 85 yards for a touch-
down. The attempt for the extra
point failed.

The blocking on the play was al-
most perfect with Davidson men cut-
ting down two would-be tacklers on
the five-yard line, permitting Mack-
orell to complete his touchdown run,

In than four State
pushed over a touchdown to tie the
score, but Windham, Wildcat end,
broke through to block McQuage’s
place-kick, thus preventing State from
going into the lead,

Late in the third quarter State
threatened again. They advanced the
ball to Davidson's 26-yard line, and
McQuage cut back over right tackle
and crossed the goal. The ball was
called back, however, and a 15-yard
penalty imposed upon State for hold-
ing.
