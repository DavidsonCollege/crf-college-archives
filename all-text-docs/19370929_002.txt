The Sunday School...

Che remark has been made time and time

again Davidson men are all too inditter-
ous and spiritual matters.

relly
Phat need not be true.

On the Davidson College campus there
now exists the most active Sunday School
that has been in session during the last four
years, At the end of last year, under the
untiring leadership of Marion Bryant, of the

senior class, that organization was a thriv-

religious group and amoying power for
good, It can continue to be such if the stu-
dent body continues to co-operate,
Itreshman, just because you're away from
home and kave more freedom, don’t let your
religious Hie fade into the background. The
