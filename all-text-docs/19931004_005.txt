Fraternity evicted from house
TUSCON, AZ (CPS)- A Univer-
sity of Arizona fraternity was
evicted from its chapter house be-
cause the building was so badly
trashed it was uninhabitable, the
Arizona Daily Wildcat reported
in September.

The Theta Delta Chi frater-
nity was charged with criminal
damages in an amount of more
than $250,000, plus $18,000 in
unpaid bills.

Under the ‘chapter’s lease
agreement, the fraternity was re-
sponsible for maintaining the
house. Damage to the building,
which the fraternity had rented
since 1967, included 40 broken
windows, damaged furniture, bro-
ken toilets, gashes and holes inthe
walls, missing doors, and piles of
debris scattered throughout the
building, according to the paper.

Investigators discovered ex-
crement on the floors, fire extin-
guishers that had been discharged
and noted that the roof needed to
be replaced. Officials told the
newspaper that the university will
support criminal charges against
fraternity members.

Stanford moves to quick photos
STANFORD, CA _ (CPS)-
Stanford U’s bookstore has de-
cided to venture into one-hour
photo processing, the latest among
a handful of schools that are try-
ing to.adapt their services to stu-
dents’ changing needs and com-

pete with off-campus businesses.

The Stanford store, which
opened its Photo Express depart-
ment in March, offers processing
and sells cameras, film and acces-
sories in a 100 square-foot area.

The fast turnaround for de-
veloping photos is possible be-
cause of a micro-lab photo pro-
cessing machine that develops and
prints 35mm film in less than 11
square feet or floor space.

“We’re inundated with film
right after big events like spring
break and graduation,” said Ellen
Gilber, Stanford’s academic sup-
ply buyer.

Festival to focus on races
CLEMSON, SC (CPS)- Can art
help bridge differences between
the races?

That is the kind of question
that will be raised during Clemson
University’s first Festival of Afri-
can-American Literature and the
Arts to explore the role of race in
novels, films and other art forms.

The October 20-24 festival
will feature playwright Alice
Childers, novelist Dori Sanders,
and poet Nikki Giovanni, whowill
discuss their work, and an art ex-
hibit and jazz and gospel concerts.

Harvey Gantt, former mayor
of Charlotte, NC will deliver the
welcoming remarks. In 1963,
Clemson University was the first
college in the South to be inte-
grated peacefully by Gantt; then
an architecture student.

Alumnae celebrate 20 years of coeducation

By Kristin Garris

The celebration of twenty
years of coeducation at Davidson
was held this weekend. Sponsored
by the Alumni Association, the
celebration included receptions for
the various classes, a picnic din-
ner on Friday, a panel discussion
concerning coeducation, a lunch
and round table discussion for
women only, classroom experi-
ences with female faculty, tours of
the campus and Visual Arts Cen-
ter, cocktails and dinner on Satur-
day, and a worship service Sun-
day morning at Dogwood Dell.

At the picnic dinner on Fri-
day, Dr. Libby Mills’ talk “Obser-
vations of a Loyal Daughter”
prompted discussion that carried
over into Saturday’s forum. She
noted that there are still signs of a
male-dominated Davidson, an
example of whichis the alma mater
which states “Our Fathers.” Now
that Davidson has over two thou-
sand alumnae, it was argued, an
alma mater saying “Our Parents”
would more accurately describe
the Davidson community of
alumni and be more inclusive for
female students who now repre-
sent 45% of the student body.

The ratio of men and women
in the student body was discussed
at the forum Saturday morning.
Led by Dean Leslie Marsicano,
the panel members included
former President Sam Spencer ‘40,
staffperson Ruth Pittard, Ginny
Newell ‘78, Dana Lemon ‘86, True
Davis ‘83, and Amy Branch ‘93.
The paneldiscussion was well-
attended by alumnae, faculty, and

current students. Dr. Ruth Ault
and Gardner Roller Ligo ‘73, who
works in Admissions, pointed out
that even some members of the
Board of Trustees are reluctant in
making the student body equal in
terms of the female/male ratio. The
class of 1996 represents the first
class in the history of Davidson in
which there are more females than
males. In order to keep the ratio of
the student body at 55% male--a
figure set by the Board of Trust-
ees--less women were admitted in
the class of 1997. As more females
enter Davidson, the “host-guest”
system becomes less of a reality,
yet the existence of a set ratio of
women and men keeps firm the
idea of men as a majority.

Alumnae from the first classes
to include women spoke of the
challenges they faced as females
on a predominantly male campus.
They encountered hostility from
both male students and faculty who
felt “invaded” by the presence of
females. Ginny Newell ‘78 com-
mented on the lack of facilities--
including restrooms--which made
the early years of coeducation te-
dious. She and the audience
laughed when she stated: “It got
better each year...as one more class
of all males graduated.”

Concern was expressed dur-
ing the forum by some alumnae
who feel that the pressures exerted
on Davidson students to succeed
in the business and professional
world hinder women who are full-
time mothers, not full-time em-
ployees. Onealumnasaidshe feels

asked “what are you doing now?”
and she replies, “I’m a mother.” A
concern comrhon to many women
is how to balance career and fam-
ily, and for Davidson alumnae, the
pressure to succeed is especially
pervasive.

Dr. Sam Spencer ‘40, who was
president of Davidson in 1973
when women were first admitted
as freshmen, spoke of the actual
process in making Davidson co-
educational. He stated that “the
time was right” for the acceptance
of women; Spencer was applauded
Saturday night for his part in mak-
ing women feel welcome. at
Davidson.

Topics brought up during the
morning panel discussion were
continued during the lunch and
round table discussion held for
women only. Saturday afternoon,
four “classroom experiences” were
held for alumnae. Dr. Janet Shan-
non spoke on “Family Structure

and Freedom: Philadelphia in the
18th and, 19th Centuries,” Drs.
Sally McMillen and Mary
Thornberry discussed “Whén Race
is Relevant: From Jim Crow to
Mel Watt,” Dr. Maurya MacNeil
spoke of “The Under-Represefita-
tion of Women in the Sciences,”
and Dr. Ruth Ault talked about
“Gender Roles in Fairy Tales.”

During the dinner hosted by
Sherburne Laughlin ‘83 and Carol
Connor Willingham ‘77, for whom
Connor Eating House was named,
announced the organization by
alumnae of a scholarship to be
given to a female each year upon
her entrance to Davidson. The
keynote speaker for the dinner was
Elizabeth Kiss ‘83, the only fe-
male Rhodes Scholar from
Davidson, now Assistant Profes-
sor of Politics at Princeton Univer-
sity. Her address, entitled “Mea-
suring Our Success,” was power-
ful and moving. She spoke of
coeducation at Davidson in light
of the historical and continuing
fight by women for equality .

At the conclusion of the ad-
dress and dinner, alumnae and
presentstudents felta bond uniting
them in the tradition of women at
Davidson.

The celebration of coeduca-
tion at Davidson was a success;
alumnae saw the fruits of their
labors in the improvements of con-
ditions for women on campus, and
students both sensed the part they

‘play in long tradition of women at

Davidson and began to appreciate
the pioneering work of the women
who came before.
