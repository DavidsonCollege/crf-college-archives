Ethical questions fuel character clashes in Broadcast News

By BRUCE PLOURDE

Some go to a movie with a preconceived
notion of what constitutes a good movie.
Some. have a checklist, which they consult
from time to time as a bit of comedy or a
piece of superior acting appears on the
screen. Others have a checklist for the
number of nudity or figtit scenes. The
movie fares well or poorly in their opinion
according to the number of checks which
they place in each category. Some people
are bom critics.

On the other side of the canyon are those
who judgea movie asa whole, notjustas the
sum of its parts. For them a movie is a two-
hour experience, gratifying or disappoint-
ing as the case may be. They do not reason

really, really liked it,” or “Ihated it, Ireally,
really hated it.” They follow William
Hurt’s “Big Chill” School of Appreciation,
the basic tenet of which is, “Sometimes you
just have to let art flow over you:” Some
people are born patrons.

Fortunately for both groups the salient
features of Broadcast News are no real
mystery. Broadcast News is a latter-day
romance centered around the ethics of the
news industry. The love triangle surrounds
the ‘Mr. Clean of broadcasting, Tom
Grunick (William Hurt), the mildly psy-
chotic but wildly capable Jane Craig (Holly
Hunter), and the brilliant, albeit conceited
and anti-charming, Aaron Altman (Albert
Brooks).

use of logic. Instead they base their judg-
ment on intuition. As a result of their
persuasion, if someone. should ask them
about the movie they just stepped from ten
minutes before, the most profound com-
ment the intuitive spectator can possibly
make will come out as either “I liked it, I

Miss Craig and Mr. Altman have earned
their positions through a great deal of hard
work and ability. Mr. Grunick has riser to
fame gratis his good looks. He represents
everything that Jane and Aaron despise, in
the main because they envy hiseasy affabil-
ity, but also because he represents the worst
kind of irresponsible journalism, the sales-

manship approach to newscasting. Though
Alan easily maintains his jealous disdain of
Tom, Jane falls in love with him in spite of
herself. The unattainable person of this
romance, the one put on a pedestal, is not a
woman, but aman carved from ivory, Tom
Grunick.

The touchy, philosophical questions of '

ethics don’t dominate this film, but instead
actas fuel for the fierce clashing of colorful
characters. It is indeed a realistic look
behind the scenes of televised news shows
(Walter Cronkite even said so), but the
audience doesn’t care nearly as much for
the code of ethics as for Tom, Jane and

‘ Aaron. Thrown together by chance, their
__ sive become_permanently_revised_and__ mannerisms haven’t changed. They have
‘both codified and stagnated at the same

edited in the pursuit of their profession and
each other.

Tom Grunick had a penchant for pulling
the wool over people’s eyes even as a child
from Kansas City. As a handsome, whole-
some adult from the heart of America he has
perfected his art. Few bul-sh-t artists have
attained the status of this, the Picasso of

bovine feces. He has beauty and presence,
but he lacks (and he will readily admit it)
sufficient brain processes.

He goes on the air reading the news and
“selling” himself without any knowledge
of what he’s reading. He doesn’t need to
know; he has the teleprompter right before
his eyes. But he feels uneasy under the
weight of Jane’s opinion, which he aspires
to improve. William Hurt again puts in the
great performance that his audience ex-
pects from him. He plays the role of the -
handsome and irresponsible romantic,
which seems the only role he ever gets, with,
credibility.

But in all the movies.that he has done his

time. For instance, whenever someone
insults him and walks away, he looks after

them with a half-surprised, half-sarcastic

Stone’s persistence makes Platoon a cinematic experience

By JOHN HARRIS

Four, count ‘em, four Oscars!
Unless you’ ve locked yourself in
the ‘braire or been in an alcohol-
induced coma for the last 18
months (like me), you most cer-
tainly have seen or at least heard
about Oliver Stone’s phenome-
nally successful Oscar-winning
film Platoon ($138,000,000
grossed to date). The film, as well
as the story behind making it,
threw Hollywood on its ears.

Stone’s semi-autobiographical
film recounts his experiences in a
small Army detachment in Viet-
nam. More significantly, it is a
story about the loss of innocence.
Stone’s character, woodenly por-
trayed by Charlie Sheen, arrives in
Vietnam as an Ivy League drop-
out. Up to that moment he had
been sheltered from the harshness
of the real world, but through his
experiences he is ultimately bap-
tised into manhood by the horrors
of war. His innocence and naiveté
give way to the realizations of
mortality and the conflicts within
the human psyche. Oooh.

While the film itself is truly
captivating, the story of Stone’s
struggle to get the film made is
equally fascinating. Let’s talk
show-biz: Stone copped an Oscar
in 1978 for his screenplay for
Midnight Express (another must-
see for you culturally deprived
liberal arts droogs). That estab-
lished him as a minor force in
Tinseltown, until he hung himself
with his second directorial effort,
The Hand, afew years later. In the
meantime, Stone had been
shopping Platoon around from
studio exec to studio. exec, and
they all rejected it.

It wasn’t until the critical and
minor box-office success of Sal-
vador in 1985 that Stone received
the financial backing he needed
for Platoon, this time from a rela-
tively small independent film
company. Fifty-four days later
Stone, cast, and crew returned
from the Philippines (former
homeland to that lady with the

buttloads 0’ shoes) with the film,
on time and shot within the con-
fines of a paltry $5 million budget
(a veritable shoestring budget by
Hollywood standards).

All of Stone’s concerted efforts
are augmented by Platoon’s ex-
cellent cast, though few faces in
the film were recognizable to the
general public at the time of re-
lease. Sheen’s face is probably
new tomostaudiences, unless you
happened to catch a glimpse of
him in Red Dawn, or the obscure
release Thrée for the Road. Per-
haps you caught his cameos in
Ferris Beuller’s Day Off and in
brother Emilio Estevez’s film
bore, Wisdom. He can now be
séen in the new Oliver Stone film
Wall Street opposite Michael
Douglas and Daryl (yawn!) Han-
nah.

Other cast members of Platoon
include Tom Berenger (The Big
Chill, Fear City) and Willem
Dafoe (To Live and Die in LA.,
Streets of Fire) as the at-odds
sergeants who battle for posses-
sion of Chris’ (Sheen) soul. An-
other face in the film belongs to
Forest Whitaker, a fine young
black actor who is making the
jump from relative obscurity (a bit
part in Fast Times at Ridgemont
High) to solid career moves (The
Color of Money and Good Morn-
ing, Vietnam).

After the success of Platoon,
the box-office bonanza of Wall
Street, various co-screenwriting
credits to his name (including
Michael Cimino’s Year of the
Dragon), and after over a decade
in the business, it is safe to say that
Oliver Stone has arrived. As the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences will attest four-fold,
Platoon is a triumph of both style
and substance. Platoon is the
most commercially successful
movie since The Sting to win the
Best Picture Oscar, and every
frame of celluloid is all the proof
you'll need. The New Yorker and
Time magazines lauded the film
and Stone. USA Today wouldn’t

let it alone for weeks.

So my goal is not to give youa
rehashing of what scores of film
critics have been saying since the
movie was released. My goal is to
show you how a talented cast and
a gifted and persistent filmmaker
can blend together to bring you a
magical cinematic experience
(Frank Lord will argue that point,
but hey, it’s my computer).

Platoon willbe shown Wednes-
day night at 9:45 in dem 900
Zimmer, and again on Friday at
7:30 and 9:45. But even after
singing all these praises for this
tour-de-force film, I don’t even
get to see it (sob!). Like most of
my other 2nd year Humes buddies
I'll be holed up in my room
Wednesday night churning out a
disgustingly bad first draft of
Paper #2, and Friday I'll be in
Atlanta with Bill Giduz and a
veritable trainload of neo-hippies
at a juggler’s convention. So

You can’t get AIDS by giving blood

Dear Confidential Health,

There has been so much atten-
tion given to AIDS (Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome)
lately in the news. Can I get AIDS
from donating blood at school
blood drives?

AIDS is a serious disease and
one that does merit attention but
not great alarm. Your question is
extremely important since there is
a great need for blood donations.

No, absolutely not, never can an
individual contract AIDS from
donating blood. Each time a per-
son gives blood, sterile equipment
and disposable needles are used.
Blood is badly needed and it is
necessary to dispel this myth.

The confusion with AIDS and
blood is concerned with blood
transfusions. All blood that is
collected at donation drives is
screened for any virus, including

AIDS. This is aprocess thatis still
being perfected. If a virus is de-
tected ina donor’s blood, then that
blood is not used for transfusions.
The donor would also be con-
tacted if a virus was present. No
one should donate if they suspect
that they have been exposed to the
virus.

The Davidson College popula-

tion is an excellent donor group

because they are generally in very
good health.

AIDS is an infectious disease
but it is not spread through casual
contact. In fact, family members
other than sexual partners have
not developed the disease.

AIDS cannot be caught by sit-
ting next to a person with AIDS,
swimming in the same pool, eat-
ing from the same dishes, sharing
the same bathroom, or from
coughing or sneezing, to give a
few examples. Scientists agree

that AIDS is not highly conta-
gious.

We all need to be aware of how
to protect ourselves. In a future
“Confidential Health,” safe sex

.and AIDS protection will be dis-

cussed. What we all need to
remember is that AIDS can strike
men and women regardless of
their sexual orientation. Itdoesn’t
happen to us because of who we
are but because of what we do.

If you know of someone with.
AIDS, it is important that dis-
crimination and hysteria be
avoided. Please be supportive: of
gay and straight friends who are
concerned about AIDS.

If readers have questions about
AIDS, please call the Metrolina
AIDS Project at 333-2437, talk to
a doctor at the Davidson Infir-
mary, or write to “Confidential
Health,” Davidson College Infir-
mary, Davidson, NC 28036.
