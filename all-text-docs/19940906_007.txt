THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1994 4

; C hattesing assiduously from bal-
cony and orchestra, the crowd of

New Yorkers filed into the Phil-

harmonic auditorium and settled
among the crimson velveteen seats.
Unnoticed by the swarm, I sat qui-
etly in the center section of the
lower level and listened as the
heightening hum filled the empti-
ness of the cavernous room. Ca-
pable’of deciphering only neigh-
boring conversations, while most
melted together in the distance, I
considered how the current of
voices was amassing in an enor-
mity of sound as powerful as the
orchestral arrangment I had come
tohear. -

Then I saw the conductor ap-
proach his pedestal, and the
ruiduous assembly at once fell si-
lent. The erect tuxedo turned to
bow, and the wave of applause
engulfed my tiny space in the
crowd; it subsided as he faced his
subordinates again. In the silence
of anticipation, he lifted his hand
to instruct a flute, drawing a sound
out of the nothingness. The master

of music continued with a flow of
gestures that displayed evidence
of the power in his clenching fist,
and he was glorified by the obedi-
ence of his disciplined musical ser-
vants. At the end of a performance

you take the cyclical or linear ap-
proach to time. Ask yourself
whether you believe that the uni-

ous illustration that the symphony’s
music began at one point in time
and eventually, it ended. I also
believe in linear time because Gen-
esis, chapter one reads, “In the
beginning...” which is the founda-

cal performance, we were also de-
liberately called into being. Out of
the darkness, God created the world
and everything in it.

If you do not know if you
believe that last statement and have
not yet decided your religion, a
good place to begin your decision-
making process is with this doc-

ning and ending define our exist-
ence. os
My belief is that the world as
we know it began at one point in
time, ex nihil, and at some point it
will come to an end. I came to my
decision from observing the linear
motion of time in which we live.
For example, notice in my previ-

that someome created the world
because, as you have observed in
the world, when something manu-
factured exists, someone has cre-
ated it. In the same way, if you are
wondering who created that tree in
the yard or your new baby cousin,
the answer is that God created na-
ture, which is the point we are

discussing. Looking again to my
musical microcosmic illustration, -
notice that the conductor ordered
the music into existence,. and it
was. Basically, nothing spontane-
ously combusts. If we appeared
out of nothingness, someone cre-
ated us.

If you have agreed with me so
far, then you believe in God, be-
cause part of the definition of God
is “the one who created the world.”
Remember that you can support
your belief with Genesis, chapter
one, which continues to read, “In
the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth,” ¢

The belief that God i intention-
ally decided to create human life
delivers a message of love consis-
tent with other Christian beliefs.
The message is that God desires us
to exist, and therefore He must be
intimately concerned with our situ-
ation. An honest consideration of
this profound truth alone will shape
not only how we view ourselves,
but how we look at other people
and the world in which we live.

The day I became a big boy.

ike me, life is basically a con-
stant struggle to create more good
memories than bad. I want every
day to be filled with a purely raw,
“fun” memory—whatever that
means. So, I try. I try really hard
every day to “seize the day” and

live life for everything Ican. But

then I guess the question is—what
is “fun”. and what is “excitement?”

One of my friends was telling
me about a time when he became
so intoxicated that he passed out at
ten o’clock. .

“It was a great time,” he in-
formed me.

Another friend told me about
a day he spent at the beach when he
just slept in bed the whole day.

“Didn’t get up once except to
tinkle. Unbelievable time,” he
explained to me. “Ican’t wait to go
back this weekend. I’m really ex-
cited.”

These responses puzzled me.
I mean, I guess “fun” is a relative
term. .And don’t get me wrong,
staying in bed all day and urinating
sounds nice, but it doesn’t sound
that great. When I think of the true,
raw excitement that I have experi-
enced, I think of the time my: mom
told me I was a big boy for the first
time.

‘I don’t know about you, but
when I was younger I hated wear-
ing diapers. I must have been the
last kid on the block who had to
wear them. It was kind of like
having bragging rights I guess. We
wouldn’t really talk about it or
anything like that, but everyone
knew who was wearing what. It’s
not like you could hide it because
diapers always made so much noise
when you tried to run around and
stuff.

Anyway, I’ll never forget the
day that I made my first step in the
progression through the chain of
underwear. It was a Saturday or
Sunday—I know because my mom
was home from work. I had been
involved in intense toilet training
for a few months at the time (using
the “Just For Kids Jr. Toilet Ad-
venture Set’’), but I was still strug-
gling with it. I was never known

for having good aim, I guess. But
anyway, this one day I was sitting
on the J.F.K. Jr., concentrating,
when my mom walked in, as she

liked to do, to give me some help- .

ful hints. She was always so pa-
tient and encouraging.

Oni this day, however, I was
cruising,.and my mom took notice.
My aim was dead perfect and I
barely even looked down to check.
Iwas relaxed, calm, and even man-
aged to Collect a few thoughts. I
reached for the toilet paper and
only used half the roll this time. I
could tell my mom was impressed
with my new-found expertise. She
was a proud mother; she even
clapped a little.

“Oh, Holt, I’m so proud of
you. You’re becoming a big boy.”

-I swear, at the time, those
words were the closest thing to
poetry I had ever heard.

“And because you are a big
boy now, I think you’re ready for
big boy pants.”

She didn’t have to say any-
more. I was so excited that I
couldn’t control myself. I jumped
up and down, started dancing
around the room and singing every
song that came to mind. My pants
were still around my ankles, but I
didn’t care. I was so purely excited
that nothing else in the world mat-
tered. Not even my private parts
flying all over the place.

Perhaps it is a sign of the kind
of sheltered life I led, but that day
was one of the most exciting times
of my life. And it is that euphoric
feeling that I experienced on that
miraculous day of dancing and
singing that I strive to have every
moment of my life.

* And I guess you could say in
the vaguest of terms that that feel-
ing is my definition of true, raw
excitement. But the problem is, it
only happens every once ina while.
I mean, you never know when it
might happen. Sometimes it hap-
pens right before your eyes and
you don’t even know it until years

later. I guess that’s when you
realize that you might be trying too
hard.

My talent frightens even myself.

R is for rhyme scheme,

I feel really stupid;

this doesn't have one.

S is for soccer,

like watching paint dry;

it doesn't beat baseball, mom, or
apple pie.

T is for tobacco,

only one type is banned;

would the Cafe prefer if I spit in a

_ can? .
U is for ultimate,
of the frisbee sort;

many seem to like it but.it isn't a
sport.

V is for VAC,

its second year here; .

can anyone make the Rodin

disappear?

W is for workload,

it's often too steep;

don't be surprised to see this hall
counselor weep.

X is for x,

the math unknown;

even though I'll fail Calc, I'll feel I
have grown.

Y is for yearbook;
I'm not gonna pout,

‘but I just want to know why the hell

it ain't out.

Z is for Zoom,

the game has its warts;

which way is Parfigliano and which
way is Schwarz?

I hope you enjoyed this sam-
pling of my poetic wit and wis-
dom. Cracked Egg in the Nest, my
collection of poetry and short sto-
ries focusing on the ambiguity of
life, will be on shelves in October.

We as a society are a sick bunch.

May I? continued from page 6

gruesome murders and all. The
first few articles and interviews
were fine. But where does it all
stop? Why doesn’t the media just
back off and let the American legal
system work its magic? The rea-
son is because we want to hear
about it all. We have this primor-
dial need to indulge ourselves with

-horror and ill-will. I know you’re

all calling me a fool right about
now because you’ re sure you have
no part in the whole thing. But I

tell you, you are wrong.

We as a society are a sick
bunch. Ever watch the news or
read the paper? Nothing but mur-
ders, crashes, fires, wars, and crime.
Never anything good. And you
better believe it’s not the media’s
fault for giving us that junk. It’s
our fault for asking for it. In my
sincere opinion, America is in dire
need of a wake-up call. Let’s give
ourselves a slap in the face and
take a good look at how low we’ ve
sunk. It’s time to dig ourselves out
of this intellectual mire we’re in

and begin to think positive, healthy
thoughts. If we spent more time
focusing on the good in our lives,
maybe we’d all be better off.

So, the next time I (and you
too) walk through that food line
and hope to never hear from an-
other lawyer, I’ll remember much
of the problem lies in myself. And
by the way, if you ever get tired of
drinking O.J. like me, try a nice
cool glass of ice water. It’s really
much less sour and easier on the
stomach. But then again, that’s
only one man’s taste buds talking.
