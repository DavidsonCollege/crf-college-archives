The Lady at the Comer Drugstore -

She pulls the lever that sends the Coke

Gushing into a glass, and looks across the counter
To see if the nearby face has a story to offer.

She needs to laugh to relieve the boredom of

A 10 to 5 counter waitress.

She turns to the window to stare out on to the street,
To see if anything has changed

In the last ten minutes. But it is still full of

Empty clothes, pushing empty faces, into

Empty stores. It wouldn't take much

To relieve the boredom of

A 10 to 5 counter waitress.

And when she goes home she yanks the TV on,
To watch what she will not listen to,
And dials the friends she does not like,

- Only to feel the sound of her own words.
She must not stop to think of the boredom of
A 10 to 5 counter waitress.

And where has the time gone she wonders,
“Arthur's a character. The way he carries
On and all, and it’s a shame that
The old Sears Building has to dawn, and
Who would have guessed that
Jayne Miller is pregnant.” It doesn’t
Take much to relieve the boredom of
The 10 to 5 counter waitress.

Branches
Of a sycamore,
A matted
Tangled nest

From a three-month rest-- -
Shaking

Scented breeze \
