Hangchow Christian College
ihe product of the work and dreams
of many missionaries and Chinese
leaders as well as the generous gifts
of Presbyterians, both Chinese and
American.

A Northern Presbyteriah mis-}
sionary, Dr. Judson, high
schoo! for boys in Hangchow for
many years. This was taken over!
by Dr. George Fitch, another North- |
ern Presbyterian, whose dreams anid |
work pushed the school on up until
it was a college for boys. Southern
Presbyterians entered into the work
at this point and have carried al
share of the work ever since.

Dr. Fitch

Dr. Fitch had a great part in
the establishment of the campus
at its present location as it rests
hillside five miles south of |
Hangchow. This hill slopes down |
to form part of the banks of the |
Dzian Kiang river, giving a view |
from the front campus out across
the river to the rice fields of Che-
kidng province and the coastal] hills |
in the distance. |

As the student body slowly in-
creased toward the four hundred |
mark, the buildings increased, until |
before the war they included a large |
classroom_building, a school of en- |
gineering building, and a_labora- |
tory building. Two large and one |
small dormitory, a smail classroom |
building, a library, a shed for a
gymnasium, a chapel, and a num-
ber of faculty residences completed
the plant.

Chinese Gift

The small building
mentioned above was given as a
memorial to one of the students by
his family. As he was driving on
his way home, which was in Shang-
hai, the car was stopped by ban-
dits. One of his friends managed
to escape by a good piece of broken
field running which threw off the
aim of the bandits. Fhe others in
the car were killed and robbed. This
building, used by the Economics
Department, was erected by his par-
ents and contains a bronze statue
of him. '

Not too many years after the
founding of the new campus by the |
river, a small dormitory was built
and the college opened a co-ed de-
partment. Ever since then, co-eds
have been a part of the student
body of Hangchow Christian Col-
lege. At present they number about
one third of the whole student
body.!

Repairs ,

The story of the moving of the
colleges in China has been told
many times before. The move back
to the old campuses, which was just
as difficult to perform, was com-
pleted about a year ago. Hang-
chow is just beginning to recover
from this moving and is repairing
buildings and adding to her equip-
ment again,

The old campus contains six hun-
dred students in the freshman and
sophomore years, while two hun-
dred and fifty juniors and seniors
are attending the joint university
in Shanghai. The crowding is great
at the Hangchow campus, where six
are living in a roombuilt for two.
This is where the Davidson gift of
300 steel double decker beds will
help make life easier.

Books Added

Laboratories are just. beginning
to get in some equipment again and
the Library has a start on the job
of restocking the empty shelves.
Classrooms have makeshift’ furni-
ture. The chapel also has tempo-
rary furniture, as it was completely
stripped by looting. The small pipe
organ was wantonly demolished by
Japanese troops.

The religious life of the eampus
centers around the chapel building.
There Dr. Peter Shih, a recent
speaker at Davidson, held a special
series of meetings this past winter.
During this year forty members
of the student body and faculty
have joined the College Church
through baptism.

of inspirational services held at the

Davidson Unity Church from April|and the glorious sunlight not only|in establishing peace and under- |

18 to 26. Dr. Iverson is a widely
known minister and Bible teacher.

The purpose of the services was
to establish the members of the
church in their beliefs, yet Dr.
Iverson never failed to give the
outline of redemption through faith
in Jesus. Christ and to give non-
believers a chance to make an ac-
ceptance of grace. Speaking from
a wide experience in an evangelical
Christian Ministry, Dr. Iverson gave
many illustrations from his own
experiences in leading people to
Christ. Several of his sermons
taken from the following scripture
passages: John 1, Corinthians 3,
Isaiah 53, and the: most effective
was the last one from Joshua 24,
concerning the essentiality of

Bible Study
A second phase of Dr. Iverson’s
stay was his daily Bible study class

classes were primarily to give a
working knowledge of the Bible
