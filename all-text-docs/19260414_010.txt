Training,

Why do we have the Reserve Officers’

been much agitation against it. but be-

purpose behind it and see if that purpose

and logical reasoning rather than preju-
dices or sentiment.

tary protection. Do we grant that such

is needed? are some
who say that it is unnecessary because
in the future we can avoid all wars if we
so desire, but if we clearly and impar-
tially consider the teachings of history
and the Conditions that the
world today we must admit that such a
view is far too optimistic and is founded
on neither facts nor sound reasoning. We
hope and pray for peace, but at the same

time we must face the stern facts of the

forces, our jails, and the locks and bars
of our stores and banks, then we can say
no longer need military protection,
but not until then.

Since we must have military protection
and since the people of the United States
have always opposed a large standing
army, the only alternative is to have a

day is absurdly small for the protection
of such a country as this, and our safety

But it is asked, why is it necessary to
train these officers in peace time? Simply
because it is impossible to transform a
civilian into an efficient officer in a few
weeks or months when an emergency is
upon us. And just here it may be said
that there is nothing more costly than
an inexperienced and inefficient officer
leading troops into combat. In practical-
ly every other realm of human activity

the learner may learn by trial and érror, ,

but here he is dealing with human lives,
and one false move may destroy him and
his entire command. Here the cost of
mistakes is reckoned in terms of human
jlives, There is no better insurance for
| the lives of the coming generation of the

quate supply of well trained Reserve Of-
| ficers.
There are many other benefits of mil-

|

jitary training, but space will allow men- |

| tion of only two more—the physical and.

| mental benefits to the individual.

Every-
can appreciate the value of the reg-

| carriage of the body, and the habits of
| discipline and subjection to authority.
Later the individual is given the control
jof other men and gains valuable expe-

ing quickly and accurately, and in de-
| veloping qualities of leadership. This
experience is of the kind very valuable
in the outside world, and can be acquired
nowhere else in college so well or so
readily as in the R. O. T. C.

3ut the great objection to military
training that it creates a military
spirit and encourages war. Certainly any
one who has taken a thorough course of
military training knows’ that that is not
true, for a detailed study of the science
of war reveals it in all of its terror and
awfulness.

all its phases dreads it more than the

Also those oppose a
military policy are inconsistent. If they
are sure that in the future all wars can
be prevented, why not abolish our army
