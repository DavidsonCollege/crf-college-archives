NEW NEILAN FILM HAS
SPLENDID CAST

Two of the best known comedians on the
screen, three famous child actors, un-
usually handsome leading man, the
funniest farceurs on the speaking stage,
noted “heavy,” and an absolutely unknown
girl play the leading roles in Marshall Neil-
an’s production of “Mike,” which is the next
attraction at the Imperial Theatre, Charlotte.

The Charlie Murray and
Ford Sterling. The celebrated children are
Frankie Darro, Junior Coghlan and Muriel
Francis Dana. The stage comedian, who
came to Hollywood some time ago to take up
a film career, is New Sparks. The villain is
Sam De Grasse. The new girl, a recent “dis-
made by Neilan, who is noted for
developing many newcomers, is Sally O'Neill.

This exceptional company, under the direc-
tion of the expert young Irishman, undeniably
makes an extraordinarily funny and drama-
strong picture. The story, which
Neila wrote himself, is the kind of material
he does best. It was ascertained at previews

ot “Mike” that the picture has tremendous
