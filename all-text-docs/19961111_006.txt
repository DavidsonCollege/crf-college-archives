Russian President Boris Yeltsin recovers quickly
after bypass surgery

Russian President Boris Yeltsin is recovering faster than expected
from the quadruple bypass surgery he underwent last Tuesday. Yeltsin
reassumed presidential power from Viktor Chernomyrden, Russia's
Prime Minister, less than 24 hours after the surgergy. On Thursday,
Yeltsin, still in the hospital, announced that November 7, once known
as Revolution Day, will now be called Day of Accord and Reconcili-
ation. Rather than celebrating the proletariate dictatorship, the day
will now officially commemorate the victims of the revolution.

Bosnia accused of arms smuggling

Central intelligence agencies throughout Europe unofficially accused

Bosnia of smuggling serious weaponry, including 155-mm howitzers,
into the country. Such artillery shipment violates the Dayton Accord,
the Bosnian peaces agreement created in Dayton, Ohio, last year.
According to intelligence reports, guns are being shipped into Bosnia
by way of the southern Croatia port.
