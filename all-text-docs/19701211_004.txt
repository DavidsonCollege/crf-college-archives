Fraternities Kicking

One of the most widely recognized evils of the
old fraternity system was the institution by which it
renewed itself every year, namely, rush.

Unfortunately, the new rush, the informal rush,
“rush 1970” is no different. ;

The old rush was nefarious by virtue of its method.
It’ seems hard to believe, but even as late as last year
fraternities really did involve themselves in-desperate
efforts to out-stud each other. No matter how hard

the fraternities may deny it, talk of brotherhood al- -

ways entered the rush parties at some time.

As if the hypocritical facade of the parties was
not enough, the “brothers” then subjected them-
selves each night to several hours of cutthroat strug-
gles known to the outside as balling sessions. -

This year we are told things are different. Spon-
sors down at the SPE house stress the ‘informality

of the be seg They assure us that bidding pro-

cedures will be different. The president of the fresh-
man class, displaying ‘his expertise, only refers to
“rush” within quotation marks as if it really were
something different this year. ae

Unfortunately, the new rush only superficially
looks different from previous rushes. -It is still, pur-

the time honored (or should we say archaic?)
object of insuring the self-perpetuation of the frater-
nity system. ie

Before any freshman accepts a bid to join a
national fraternity we hope he will seriously consider
the possibility of accepting no bid at all.

Perhaps it would be best if the freshmen recon-
sider the Report of the. Blue Sky. Subcommittee on
Student Life (from 1967), the Report of the Social
Patterns Study Commission (majority report submit-
ted in 1969), and the Student Life Section of the Re-
port of the Academy for Educational Development
(also from 1969).

These reports as summarized in the Student Life
Committee recommendations of June 1970 call for
the elimination of the fraternity system.

It is true that the report of the ‘Committee of
18” allows for the continued existence of national frat-
ernities at Davidson provided they eliminate selective
membership requirements.

However, it is time for the student of 1970 to
decide whether the national fraternity is a necessary
or even desirable adjunct to a social existence. Is
the mystic word, secret Brip, or high initiation fee
vital to a sense of community?

While this year’s rush will supposedly prolong
the lives of Davidson’s national fraternities, perhaps

it would_be_more-realistic_to say that_it is-only pro-

longing: the process of their deaths.

Innocent Abroad

_ As a part of the incredible administrative shuf-
fle and creation of new positions which began early
in the fall term, the last week before Thanksgiving
saw three further staff changes.

Actually ‘the move was very slick indeed. Presi-
dent Spencer announced the changes from a dis-
tance of several thousand miles. during a week in
which students were already preoccupied with the
impending holiday and exam periods.

Yet perhaps the move was just a bit too slick.

For one thing students played only a passive role in .
le

the changes learning of them as they were announc-
ed. Not even in the selection of a new dean of stu-
dents did they have a voice although students had
been allowed icipation in the selection of Presi-
dent Spencer two years ago.

_.In an equally unfortunate situation there is real
evidence that the faculty were not properly consulted
in these major administrative changes. According to
some scources such a lack of confidence violated
properly established procedure.

While none of this argument is meant to condemn
the changes or the men involved, it cannot be: assum-
ed with absolute certainty that- the changes would
have occurred exactly as they did had more consulta-
tion been allowed. ;

~~ We -urge the committee now studying governance
to ‘establish procedures..which would. properly avoid
such problems. ,

Activists A Disappointment

‘(Now to humiliate these
activists, I thought, when
word: came from on high
that a column of my own
was in. the offing.

Oh, to stick them with
barbs of Right ‘Reason;
what fun. Gotcha Burney,
etc,

Tantalized by the possibi-
lities, | kept close by my
typewriter and waited. And
waited. And waited.

I have now waited for an
entire’ ten-week term for the
big issue to arise, as have,
I suppose, those members
of this community who can
muster the energy to follow
the activities of the student
government.

‘All of us have been disap-
pointed. Thanks to the sen-
ate, we now have self sche-
duled exams; but that has

‘been discussed for several

years. Not exactly an epic
political victory. .
\Thanks to the RHC; its
leadership in particular, we
now know that we should
not’ throw firecrackers in
the dorms. and that we
should seek, positive, crea-
tive relationships rather than

“ negative, destructive ones.

Besides this earthshaking
piece of information: little
activity of any kind can be
seen developing in the RHC.

‘A look at the roles of the
SGA legislative organiza-
tions reveals that a sizeable
number of students repre-
sent their peers in these
august bodies. Yet little or
nothing is being done,

All. of this suggests, that:
(1) The members of the sen-
ate. and RHC. cannot, as
present, conceive of any sub-
stantive action to improve
the life of the college, (2)
there is nothing wrong with
the. college, (3) tthe SGA
leadership finds meetings a
bore, and so has called as
few as possible, (4) all of
above.

Whatever. the case is, one
thing is certain: we have
460” much——_government— at
present..Why a campis: this
size should have two govern-
ing organizations is a mys-
tery.

The leadership of the col-
lege is apparently mystified
as well, for it has establish-
ed a Committee on Campus
Governance to review,
among other things, the sen-
ate and RHC. ,

‘Whether any student legis-

‘lature exists after the com-

mittee returns its findings
is questionable.
If it is decided that effec-

tive campus governance in- ~

cludes such a body, it is
hard to see why more than
one ‘is necessary,-i!and why
that organization should in-.
clude more than fifteen
members.

[By reducing the number
of student representatives
drastically,.. student — politics
and government would both
profit.

Student office would be.
more sought after in that
they would be much more

powerful. It is even possi- .

ble that the new prestige of
students offices would lead

“to energetic campaigns ‘to
-attain’ them based on™ sub-

stance.

Numbers

v

Football is just a numbers
game. ;

There are won-lost re-
cords, yardage _ totals,
scores, averages and retir-
ed jerseys. When I was in
junior high school, we even
had a game for boring class-
es in which won-lost records
were determined solely by
random number selection. .

Some football numbers—
by ‘far the largest ones —
are prefixed by dollar signs.

(Most of these have six or

seven figures, which is more
than O. J. gained, even in
inches.

‘My fellow columnist Paul
Rowland (rue though I may
that status) added up David-
son football numbers (the
large ones, not two-and-
eight, 16 or. 2,100-plus) and
came out with a negative
sum, from which he derived
his thumbs<down on _ the
Wildcat gladiators.

I can hardly quarrel with
(Paul's figures, but, in the
interest of better relations
between THE DAVIDSON-
TAN and.the campus meso-
morphs, I will disagree with

his conelusion.

Paul claims we spend too
much money at Davidson on
an: activity which brings no
positive benefit to the..col-
lege and indeed impedes
support of more worthwhile
academic endeavors.

Admittedly a team which
wins only two games is not
a major factor’ in college
life, the way a big winner
could be (and is in basket-.
ball). But I think nonethe-
less that the program in
fact does make real contri-
butions to the college.

Senior “Frank Rader, who
plays. offensive’ guard and
may justly be singled out
for the tremendous effort he
puts into the game, has said
that the real benefit of Da-
vidson’s football program is
in the people whom it brings
to the college, who could
not” have come without the
chance to play football here.

Rader also submits that
the football players provide
a link between Davidson in-
tellectuality and the chara-
cteristics of the world out:
side the campus; since ac-

cording ‘to him they more |

nearly resemble the non-col-
fege population than do the
academically oriented.

it °will involve numerous
meetings, reports, a consti-
tutional convention, (probab-
dy), and other obstacles yet
to be discovered.

It behooves all these in-
terested in the college to fol-
low the process closely and
to participate actively, when
possible.

Until the eschaton arrives,
however, the student legisla-
tures will be in need of pro-
blems to solve:

(May I suggest the revival
of the proposition that what
the Davidson College stu-
dent. body needs most is
more and better vending
machines.

Game

Yet Davidson is designed
(perhaps not very well) to
foster precisely this intel
lectual approach, not to re-
present.the attitudes of the
populace as a whole.

However, about-half of the
Davidson student body parti-
cipates in one or another. in-
ter-collegiate sport. Gince
these sports invariabjy re-
quire an expenditure of
time and energy, they ap-
parently provide something
for participants which other
college activities do not pro-
vide.

And since an undergradu-
ate college such as Davidson
exists only in the interests
of its students (at least it
ought not exist for the sake
of employment opportunities

ANDERSON

for paper-shufflers), it is a
proper function of the col-
lege _to support — activities
which are meaningful to
its students.

There is no reason to dis-
criminate against. football.

Admittedly football is
much more expensive than
most other sports. But if the
college is to support an in-
tercollegiate program, thep
it ought to give the partici-
pants the chance to compete
meaningfully. ’

Under present conditions,
it is impossible for a foot-
ball team to compete at the
majorculiege I¢vel without
subsidization.

This statement-is not true
of soccer, nor is it true of
wrestling or of the rifle
team.

But it is true of basketball
and football, and therefore
if the college can find the
money, it properly ought to
subsidize these sports to a
far greater degree than it~

does others, whether direct-

ly or through an alumni

‘fund arrangement such as
