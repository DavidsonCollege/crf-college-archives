Union Sets
Campus
Song Fest

Friday, May 12, at. 7:00, the
Student ‘Union will sponsor the
annual all-campus Sing on the
steps of the Union.

This year’s event will be a
marked departure form those
of the past, since three perma-
nent trophies will be awarded,
one for the best conductor and
one each for first and second
places.

J. B. Doss, supervisor of the
“ging” has also emphasized that
any group, with the exception
of one of the college choirs, is
eligible to compete. Each group,
however, must contain a mini-
mum of twenty-five men.

Ten minutes will be allotted

plans he has for next year’s IFC, in a DAVISONIAN interview after his election Mon-
day. They are bring back the formal dance for dance weekends, new areas for pledge
class activities, and the utilization of the IFC for publicity for other campus activities
(such as the Artist Series and the Vagabonds).

FORMAL DANCE

Waugh said he favored one
formal dance at Homecoming,
with Spring Frolics remaining
the same as this year. Midwint-
ers would be less formal than
Homecoming. Waugh _ stated
that he would like to see pledge
competition outside Greek Week
in such areas as sports or de-
bate.

He further stated that he
would like to see the pledge
classes participate in joint ser-
vice projects, such as some type
of civic projects, He explained
that these two proposals would
have to be worked out with the
pledge class. trainers.

When asked about his view of

the IFC’s role on campus,
Waugh stated that he and the

IFC were open for suggestions
as to new areas of activities,
but that he preferred not to
hold open meetings of the IFC.
1FC IS NOT AUTOCRATIC
“The IFC is not an autocratic
body,” Waugh said. “Every fra-
ternity member is technically a
member of the IFC.” Waugh be-.
lieves that the IFC should main-
tain a position between acting
completely independent of the

Council to the fraternity having
the ‘highest percentage of don-
ors. Over 310 pints of blood

with fraternities during the
year, especially during Greek

dall ‘an ideal man for the job.”

Judging will be based on se-

lection of numbers, quality and
richness of tone, interpretation,
and effectiveness of presenta-
tion. Judges have not yet been
announced, but are expected to
come from Charlotte for the

pressed hope that the IFC will
be able to meet with the Fac-
ulty Committee on Fraterni-
ties, Clubs and Social Life dur-
ing the coming year.

CONCERT SERIES

The concert series, which the
IFC began sponsoring this year,
will be voted on in two weeks
to see if it is to be continued.
If it is continued, Waugh said
that he expects it will feature
popular artists, perhaps an or-
chestra or a well-known come-
dian like Shelley Berman.

Waugh stated that the IFC
would try to arrange these con-

.certs so that they would coin-

cide with an attraction at the
Charlotte Coliseum.

RUSH WEEK

Rush Week will be essentially
the same this fall, with the same

hours for parties, Waugh an-
nounced. A committee will be

appointed next week to dfaw up
the regulations for next year's
Rush Week.

Waugh also announced that,
Greek Week will probably be
the first week of second semest-
er as it was this year.

Congolese Student

Will Visit Campus

Jean Calvin Mayimbu, a Con-
golése student presently study-
ing at Union Theological Semi-
nary in Richmond, Va., will be
on campus Monday to speak in
student assembly and confer
with faculty and students.

Mayimbu will be coming by
invitation of the Congolese Com-
mittee. The same group had
Mrs. David Miller and Dr. Hoyt
Miller, who have both served as
missionaries to the Congo, on
campus last Monday.

‘A special coffee hour will be
held for Mayimbu following
his talk in assembly. At all
times during his stay on campus,
he will be accompanied by a
student or faculty member who
speaks fluent French. Mayimbu,
like most Congolese, has a
stronger background in this lan-
guage than in English.

The Congolese Committee will
have a special luncheon and din-
ner for Mayimbu in the College
Union Monday. A limited num-
ber of the committee members
will attend the two meals.

IN VEREEN BELL CONTEST

Hastings Takes Top Place

“Reflections,” a poem by Richard Hastings took top honors in the annual Vereen

Bell writing contest. Judged second and third were “Closing of a House”

by Ben

Sparks and “Pieces From a Fragmentary Youth” by Pete Wyrick.

John Crowe Ransom, well
known poet, critic, and teacher
of creative writing, awarded the
$75 prize to Hastings in chapel
last Thursday. The work of
Hastings, who is presently a
freshman, was termed “re.
markable” by Ransom. “He’s
the most advanced.freshman that
I have ever encountered,” he
continued. The poetry of Sparks
and Wyrick was also praised
highly. Ransom studied ten man-
uscripts for two days before
making his final selecion of the
winner and runner-ups.

I noticed a grest preoceu-
pation with sex in the poetry
submitted,” stated Ransom.
"That disturbed me a iittle,
it’s a very powertul spiritual
experience as well ap an enl-
mai ene, but seme ef the

poetry represented if as an
animal experience only.”
However, Ransom commented
that all of the contributing
authors displayed a great deal
of talent.

Before announcing the con-
test winners on Thursday, Ran-
som gave an address entitled
“The Estate of Poetry,” and
later met with Sigma Upsilon,
honorary creative writing fra-
ternty, On Thursday evening
he read and discussed some of
his own poetry in the Morrison
Room of the College Union.

Ransom's achievements made

him uniquely qualifie to judge .

the creative writing contest. Dur-
ing his undergraduate studies
at Vanderbilt University, Ran-

distinguished literary person-
ages, of The Fugitive and later,
The Kenyon Review.

After graduating from Van-
derbilt and being elected to
Phi Beta Kapps, Ransom at-
tended Christ College, Oxford,
as @ Rhodes Scholar. In 1914
he returned to Vanderbilt as
professor of English where
he served until 1937, except
for a two-year period during
which he taught at the Sav-
mur Artillery School
France with the Army.

elected to succeed Scott Lacy
as chairman of the Honor Court.

He has served on the court

ago and held the position of
recorder this year, That post

John Rogers, a rising junior.
Wellford was instrumental in
the writing of the court’s recent
statement on pledged work pre-
sented to the faculty.

“The Honor Court will en-
deavor next year to clarify
the problems that challenge the

phere of student wareness in
which these problems can be
solved,” he said.

“This will be done through
intensified orientation partici-
pation in educating freshmen on
the honor system, assembly pro-
grams, and proposals, such as
the court's recent memorandum
for the faculty on pledged
work.”

Davidsonian Associate Editor

_ Four wallets containing a total of $41 and a high school
ring belonging to members of the VPI track team were
stolen from the visiting team’s locker room in the college
gymnasium here Tuesday afternoon. The thefts were re-
ported to members of the Honor Court shortly after the

track meet.

An estimated $30 was also re-
ported stolen from dormitory
rooms during the past five days,
THE DAVIDSONIAN was in-
formed today.

Honor Court members who
investigated the thefts said
phet all but four of the VPI
track men checked their wal-
lets and valuables in the bas-
ket room, and that those four
found their clothes diserrang-
ed and money missing after
the meet. They were John
Doulton, Bob Duggsen, Dave
Buskell, and Bob Mazaitis.
The dressing room wes not
locked.

Harrison Wellford, chairman
of the Honor Court, said con-
cerning the gym theft, “There
‘is good reason to believe that
this was not done by. a mem-
ber of the Davidson student
body.” He declined to make any
further comment.

Wellford stated that in the
future visiting teams will be urg-
ed to check their valu-
ables in the basket room and
to lock the door of their lock-
er room.

This week the Student
Council and Honor Court both
planned to send fetters of
apology for the incident to the
VPI team.

Dean of Students John C.
Bailey discussed the thefts with
Henry Shue, Scott Lacy, and
Wellford Wednesday. After the
conference, Shue expressed his
hope that some arrangement
could be made to replace the
stolen $41 by voluntary contrib-
utions from members of the
student body.

‘For as long as I can remem-

“If he has accomplished that
and still does not get elected he

said one town resident.

Abernathy feels that his vot-
ing strength lies in the indus-

because they have the most at
stake individually. They have
focused their attention on the
election with hope that new in-
dustry will be encouraged by
a new mayor. .

Students were once eligible
to vote in the town elections,
but they got a night watchman
to file for mayor and nearly
elected him. Since that time
students have been excluded
from voting by law.
