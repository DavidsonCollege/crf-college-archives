Tom Covington, fraternity liai-
son officer, said that although
nothing specific was suggested
at the meeting. those nationals
which had specific concerns
about the affiliation plan will
prepare briefs of those concerns
and submit them -to the college
for consideration.

Assistant to the President Fred
Sackett noted that communica-
tions between the faculty and
the national offices were greatly
improved by the meeting. He
said that the objections cited at
the meeting were not as strong!
as the administration had:
feared.

Covington described the meet-
ing as ‘‘very useful," saying that
it gave both sides an opportunity
to ‘air most of their differ-
ences.””

He added that although there
were some “honest differences’
between the views expressed,
everyone in attendance was
hopeful that these differences
could be resolved.

Ten of the 12 fraternities on
campus were represented. One
representative was forced by
illness to miss the meeting. The
other absent representative gave
no reason for his failure to at-
tend.

“There were several groups
which had real reservations,”
said Covington. “Most of these
differences centered around the
term ‘social affiliate.” In most
of the cases we were able to ex-
plain the unique nature of the
Davidson affiliate.”

According to Covington. four
attending officers strongly fav-
ored the proposed plan. He said
that these four ‘feel very se-

The union paid the first stu

The defense for the student

defendant did not know that he

The tactics of the company

Council Charters
Davidson SSOC

A Davidson Chapter of the
Southern Student Organizing
Committee (SSOC) was chart.
ered by the Student Activities
committee Wednesday.

The chartering had originally
been delayed, according to Tom
Earnhardt, student body presi-
dent and chairman of the com
mittee.

The delay, however, was due,
to lack of a definite statement
of purpose for the Davidson
campus. The group was chart-
ered unanimously by the facul-’
ty student group when a state
ment of goals at Davidson was
produced.

Junior Hi’s Get Tutors’ Aid

By ROBERT PYEATT

Assistant Managing Editor
. Approximately 15 disadvant-
aged Charlotte junior high
school students are coming to
Davidson every Saturday morn-
ing for tutoring by Davidson
students through Project Op-
portunity.

The students, from Irwin
Avenue High School. are taught
geometry, English. science,
geography and world affairs,
according to Roger Ward. Rich-
ardson Scholar and director of
the tutoring. Ned Kelly and Fhil
Jones are other tutors.

The purpose of the pro-
gram is to select disadvantag-

ed students with high acade-
mic potential and to prepare
them to enter college by the
time they graduate from high
school. Only one student out
of 100 that enter Irwin Avenue
High Schoo! will go to col-

tege.

Project Opportunity is financ
ed by the Ford Foundation and
sponsored by the Southern As-
sociation of Schools and Col
leges. It currently involves 11
schools and 17 colleges in eight
states.

“Participating colleges -- in
this case Davidson-—will event-
ually offer admission and scho
larship help to a small number
of Project stidents."’ ocplained
Chris Sanford. Charlotte direc.
tor of the Project. “‘Meanwhile,
they, their faculties and stu-
dent bodies, have accepted an
obligation to offer a variety of
assistance to Project students.”

Project Opportunily first be-
gan at Davidson last summer
by bringing the studsnts to
campus. for cultural events,
tiloring by faculty members
and faculty wives, and use
of the college facilities. His-
tory Professor Norman John-
sen Is chelrman of the facul-

ty committee.

This year Kelly began the tu-
toring part of the Project and
Ward later headed it. Jones
will direct the tutoring next
year.

“The students are very
sharp, believe me.” Ward said.
“Some of them are very well
informed. It’s been so popular
at Irwin Avenue School that for
the number of people who have
applied and can qualify we
would need a tutorial staff of
12 or 13."

The Project is planned to run
for the next 15 years. Bach
group of seventh graders who
are selected will be tutored
through high school and will
remain in the Project through
college. Project Opportunity
will continue until the sixth and
last group of seventh graders
selected has graduated from
college.

Johnsen explained that Pro-

ject Opportunity is a pilot
program to determine if dls-
advantaged children can be
taken as late as the seventh
grade and prepared for col-
lege.

According to Sanford, ‘lis
purpose is to selected academi
cally talented youngsters from
disadvantaged backgrounds. to
motivate them academically, to
strengthen them academically.
to improve. their cultural back.
ground, to offer extra guidance,
and ultimately to see them en
ter college and be successful
there.”

“Next year Project Oppor-
tunity and the Student Tutorial
Education Program will coordi-
nate activities, including a joint
recruiting drive,"’ said Jones.

Sanford emphasized the high

potential of the students in -

comparison with their poor ed-
ucational background.
