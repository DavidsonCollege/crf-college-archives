Changes ‘in Student Body Constitution

New Amendments Deal With Liquor
and Appeal

CHANGES ARE NEEDED

Court of Appeal Would Be Vested
in the Senior Class by
Amendment

Saturday morning at the student body
meeting two proposed amendments to the
Constitution were placed before the student
body. These proposed amendments were
read and explained to the students and now
will lie upon the table to be voted upon after
a period of ten days.

The first amendment was placed before the
students by Joe McConnell. This amendment
is in respect to Article 5, Section 2, which
reads as follows: No student shall be guilty
of drinking alcoholic liquors or having same
in his possession on the campus.

The amendment will change this section to
read as follows: No student shall be guilty
of drinking alcoholic liquors, being under the
influence of, or having same in his possession
on the campus.

The second proposed amendment was
placed before the students by Bill Christian.
This amendment is in respect to Article VJ,
Section 6. The only change that is made in
this section by the amendment is to place the
retrial of the accused, if the accuser or the
accused feels that he has not received justice
at the hands of the Student Council, in the
hands of the Senior Class instead the
hands of the Student Body.

This proposed amendment changes Article
VI, Section 6, to read as follows:

Should the accuser or the accused feel that
he has not derived.justice at the hands of the
Student Council, he may carry his case be-
fore the Senior Class. He shall first notify

Will be Played During Coming Week

The Davidson basketball team has three
very hard games next week. One of these
is at Salisbury, while the other two are staged
at the Davidson Gym. These games are with
Salisbury “Y”, January 1-3th;
Theological Seminary, on January 15th, and
Wofford, on January 18th. :

The Salisbury team is composed of former
college stars and among these are Flake
Laird, Davidson's great athlete; Jim Moore
and John Shanks, two more Wildeat stars,
are on the team. With this array of David-
son men, who will be aided by some of the
very best men in the state, Salisbury will
prove a team that will test the locals to the
limit.

On January 15th, the Ministers from
Union Theological Seminary will invade the
Wildcat stronghold. As yet, there have been
few reports concerning the strength of this
team, but what rumors have come indicate
that this quintet is a force that will bear
watching.

that the strain on the wind and morale of the
team will be great.

The Wofford Terriers meet the Wildcat
team on the 18th. It is reputed that this team
is taking all comers successfully in) South
Carolina and that they are in Bae for the
championship of the’ state. i

The team will have no rest be-

Of course, it ts
too early to predict with any degree of
curacy the result of this game, but the Da-
vidson team is going to give all they have to
win this contest, the first big game ot the
season. If the team shows up as well as it
has in the past few games, and continues to
develop, the Terriers will have a hard match.

The schedule of games for the rest of the
season is as follows:

Feb. 1—Elon, Davidson.

Feb. 2—N. C. State, Raleigh.
