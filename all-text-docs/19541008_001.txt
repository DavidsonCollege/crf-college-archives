Business-Economics Club To Hold |
Program Tuesday

“Three Ways Up the Ladder,”
the first of a series of programs

given by the Business Economics |
Club of Davidson, will be present- |

ed this coming Tuesday night in
the College Union at 8 o'clock.

This meeting, featuring three
outstanding Charlotte business-
men, will be the initial meeting
of the club this year, and all new
members and others interested in
joining the club are invited to at-
tend.

The theme of the meeting,
“Three Ways Up the Ladder,” was
chosen in order to let three Char-
lotte men give the members of the
club short talks on the subject
of opportunity and the way that
they found it.

Messrs. John Watlington, George
Dowdy, and Ed Burnside, Sr. are
to be the speakers. Mr. Watlington
is the Senior Vice-President of
Wachovia Bank and Trust Com-
pany and an active leader in Char-

lotte. Mr. Dowdy is the Vice-
President and General Manager
of Belk’s of Charlotte. He has long
been a leader in the Belk organi-
‘zation and was closely associated
with W. H. Belk, Senior. Mr. Burn-
side, Sr. is a former college pro-
fessor. He turned from this pro-
fession into the Home Finance
Group, Inec., of which he is now
President.

Officers of the club this year
are Gayle Averyt from Columbia,
S. C., President; Stebbins Ingram
from Winston-Salem, Vice-Presi-
dent; Roy Davis of Concord, Secre-
tary, and Cortez Cooper from
Thomasville, Georgia, Treasurer.

The Board of Directors of the
Club is composed of these four
men plus six more. This board
makes decisions as to programs,
members, and fees.

Bob Owens was President of the
Club in its organization last Janu-
ary and February. He and Prof.

ment took a large part in planning

LATE, LEARNS FAST

What was your greatest shock upon arriving in Ameri-

ca? This was the question. The

answer: ‘Not seeing any Amer-

ican girls at first.” What was your second greatest shock?

“Seeing them!” Thus —_
latest arrival—a very intelli
hails from Finland named
kainen.

Peter arrived in this country
just eight days ago; yet he has al-
ready formed some _ interesting
opinions on American life in gen-
eral. “The prosperity of your coun-
try and the way you use it are
amazing,” exclaimed the bespectac-
led good-looking Finn. Before com-
ing to America Peter had obtained
a very adequate picture of our
country as far as the governmen-
tal system and other related as-
pects are concerned. Throughout
his life he has been interested in
America and thus read as many
of the best books concerning the
American way of life that he could
find.

Peter's Background

Peter was born in Viiburi, a town
comparable in size to Charlotte,
and now under Russian control.
His mother and father are both
living, the latter being a sales-
man of leather goods in the mar-
ket town of Karkkila. Peter has
one brother who is seven years
old and in the elementary school
at Karkkila.

The educations system in Fin-
land is such that a student usual-
ly begins school when he is seven.
However, when Peter was only five
and a half, he secretly went to
school with some older friends one
day and liked it so well that he
determined to stay. His work was
of such a calibre that his teach-
ers were persuaded to let him re-
main, even though, as Peter says,
“I was a very lively student.”

Learns Of Scholarship

During a two-day leave of ab-
sence from the army for a visit to
his family in Karkkilan, Pertti's
mother told him about some avail-
able scholarships for education in
the United States. Preliminary ap-
plications were immediately sub-
mitted to a group called the Fin-
nish Committee on Study and
Training in the United States. Two
weeks from the date of submis-
sion of this application, he receiv-
ed an invitation to come to Hel-
sinki to take a series of tests. Ev-
en after passing these tests, a sec-
ond application was required by
the Committee, and, in the words
of Peter, “It was something ter-
rible; 80 pages of it.”

On September 1, 1954, Peter re-
ceived officially the news that he
had won a scholarship to the Unit-
ed States. “My first response to
this news was one of complete sur-
prise since I hadn’t heard any news
about my scholarship since last
January.” Sinee the Karkkainen
home has no telephone, Peter re-
ceived the good news on a neigh-
bor’s phone, and jumped on his
bicycle at once to head home to
spread the tidings.

The next problem that Peter
faced was that of arranging a loan
for his passage across the Atlantic.
“It was lots of trouble, but I ar-
ranged it, however — because I'm
here,” laughed my amiable room-
mate. The trip across thé ocean
was made on the U. S. S. Neptunia,
which incidentally ran into a ter-
rible storm. Peter had luckily be-
come used to the sea, and since
