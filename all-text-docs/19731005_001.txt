Christian Tenure Policy Unresolved

By HUGH MOORE
Contrjbuting Editor

(Ed. Note: This article is the
first in a two-part series on
Davidson's Christian com-
mitment. It focuses on the
faculty tenure requirement.
Next week's article will deal
with other expressions . this
commitment. )

According to the Trustee By-
laws, “‘Any faculty member
given tenure must be an active
member of a Christian church.”’
This sentence is possibly the
most controversial item in the
entire document.

At least since 1969 strong ef-
forts have been made to have
this requirement deleted. In
that year a commission was
established to study church-
college relations.

Its reported opinion was that
Davidson’s Christian com-
mitment should be maintained
by informal methods rather
than by By-laws such as the one
dealing with tenure.

Although there was a change
in the wording of the
requirement after the com-
mission’s report was received,
the restriction still remained in
the By-laws.

In November of last year the
issue was raised again when
Professor of Religion Alexan-
der J. McKelway submitted a
resolution to the faculty which
called for the deletion of the
sentence in the By-laws on
tenure.

His resolution was signed by
11 other members of the faculty
and staff, most of whom were

The student Senate endorsed
the resolution and sent their en-
dorsement to the Board of
Trustees. Plans were then
made for discussion of the
tenure matter by the officers of
the Board and the Faculty
Executive Committee (FAC).

But in order to put the issue

again before the faculty, the
Educational Policy Committee
presented another resolution in
May of this year which put the
tenure requirement in the
larger context of Davidson’s
Christian commitment. The
faculty passed this resolution
May 29.

The proposal stated that con-
scientious recruitment of
faculty members should ‘‘ob-
viate the necessity for the
present By-laws specifying a
religious requirement for
tenure, which, we feel, is likely
to inhibit the recruitment of the
best faculty and student body
that could be obtained by

suggesting that Davidson lacks
intellectual freedom and diver-
sity of opinion.”

In addition the resolution en-
couraged and broadened the
scope of discussions on
Christian commitment. Sub-
sequent meetings which have
included the Faculty Religious
Policy and Program Committee
as well as trustee members,
have largely dealt with areas of
Christian expression other than
the tenure requirement.

The upcoming October
meeting of the Joint Com-
mittees, though, will probably
address the tenure issue.

Even optimistic members of

the committees do not predict a
recommendation concerning
tenure until spring of next year.
Moreover, the final decision on
any proposal will be made by
the Board of Trustees and few
are willing to anticipate how
they will act.

It is generally believed that
the trustees are more opposed
than any other segment of the
college community to the
deletion of the requirement.
Board Chairman Warner L.
Hall’s opinion bears this out.

‘‘Davidson is a Christian
college and it is appropriate for
it to have a Christian faculty,”’
Hall said recently in a telephone

interview. ‘‘Davidson cannot be
all things to all people.”

Hall pointed out that David-
son should continue to be an
alternative to colleges and
universities which do not main-
tain a Christian commitment.

On campus, supporters of the
tenure requirement have not
been as vocal as their coun-
terparts. FEC member
Malcolm Lester, believed to be
in favor of retaining the restric-
tion in some form, declined to
make any comment.

Likewise, college President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. has
hesitated to make his sen-

Electronic Theft-Prevention Devices

To Be Considered For New Little Library

By ALEC HOON
Editor-in-Chief
It is now a distinct possibility
that the new E. H. Little
Library will operate on an elec-
tronic detection system to pre-
vent the theft of more library
books.

In a memo to members of the
Library Committee, Director of
the Library Chalmers G. David-
son included a report on two
electronic systems for the
prevention of book thefts which
might be utilized in the Little
Library.

The report, compiled by
Reference Coordinator for In-
dependent Study Mary Beaty,
related findings on the ‘‘Check-
point System’’ presently in

operation in the Charlotte
Public Library, and the ‘‘Tat-
cotaPes System” used at UNC-

In the memo, Davidson
stated, ‘‘It (an electronic
system) is worth our con-
sideration for possible use in the .
new E. H. Little Library”’.

According to Davidson, the
reason for even considering
such a system is the alarming
increase in the number of books
stolen last year as compared to
that of previous years.

“Previous to last year, we
would lose about 250 books
during the year, but we would
recover about 150. However, af-
ter a final tabulation last year,
we discovered we were still

Poll Shows Faculty Opinion
Regarding Governance Issues

AN ANALYSIS

By TOM BRUCE
TODD EADES
ALEC HOON

(Ed. note: This article, the
third in a continuing series
dealing with the governance
crisis at Davidson, focuses on
faculty feelings toward student
participation in governance.)

In an attempt to promote
discussion of college gover-
nance questions THE DAVID-
SONIAN conducted a poll of the
faculty regarding the extent of
student participation in each of
the two governance systems un-
der consideration and the
desirability of an office of chair-
man pro-tempore of the faculty.

‘and the fact that responses
were often dependent upon
which system will be im-
plemented inevitably

Senators

In Wednesday's SGA
runoff elections for fresh-
man class Senators-at-
Large, coed Julie Deck was
elected Senator and
President of the freshman
class, capturing 177 votes.
The other two Senators
selected were Bo Hunter and
John Swanson,

necessitated questions of a
general nature.

Yet the questions were
designed to be an entree to
discussion which would provide
a fuller understanding of the
context in which the responses
were given. Fifty-two members
of the faculty were interviewed
for this purpose.

Twenty-four members of the
faculty were asked ‘Should
students attend and participate
in faculty meetings except for
executive session?”’

Many of the professors an-
swering ‘‘no’’ took pains to ex-
plain that although student in-
put to faculty meetings was
desirable, faculty meetings
were not deemed the best
mechanism to achieve this.

Faculty integrity as a body of
professionals was often cited,
as was the fact that many
faculty concerns are of little in-
terest to students. (Faculty
committees were often men-
tioned to a means of securing
student participation. )

Others mentioned the un-
favorable repercussions of
regular student attendance and
pointed out that in the past
students have been invited to
discuss particular issues before
the faculty.

The same professors were
also asked ‘Should students
vote in faculty meetings except

in matters of faculty personnel
policy?’’ Five responded yes, 15
no, and four no comment.

Some said the number of
student votes would be _ in-
significant or indicated that
their response might be dif-
ferent if asked about a faculty
assembly system. Others
believed that only teaching
faculty should vote in faculty
meetings.

Twenty-eight professors were
asked, ‘‘In your opinion should
students attend faculty assem-
bly in a non-voting capacity?”
The question yielded a mixed
response: 14 were in favor of
student participation, while 11
opposed it. Three professors
had no comment.

Although the sample is not
conclusive, this finding appears
to flow logically from the coun-
ter-part response of the other

More faculty members are in
favor of student participation in
the ‘‘college assembly’’ context
than in the context of faculty
meetings as presently defined.

The reasons for this finding
are multiple and complex.
Some professors argued that
students have no place in
professional meetings. Others
said that students are the most
transient segment of the
population, and are therefore

“While some of these books
(notably rare Southern Im-
prints) were undoubtably taken
by professional book thieves.
others seem to have been taken
by amateurs.

professional thief as he would
want the whole set,’’ Davidson
explained.

Davidson said that he would
be “‘extremely reluctant’’ to in-
stitute any type of closed shelf
system for several reasons,
notably that skilled thieves
could probably beat it anyway,
and for the implications to the
Davidson Honor System.

“Both Bevan and Spencer
have expressed reluctance for
such a drastic step because it
would undermine the whole
Honor system here, and I con-
cur with their feelings; but if
this is what is necessary to
prevent the costly theft of more
books, then it may have to be

done as it is done at many other
libraries,’’ Davidson said.

means foolproof, and that
professional thieves could beat
them in several different ways.

Davidson indicated that
sometime in the future the
Library Committee will make a
decision on what kind of a
system will be instituted in the
Little Library.

LIBRARY CHECKOUT
Senior Todd Eades takes time to properly check out a library
book. If an electronic protection system is installed in the new Lit-
tle Library, the checkout procedures will be more complicated.
