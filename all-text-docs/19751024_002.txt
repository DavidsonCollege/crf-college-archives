Crime forces Hub into city suburbs

By THOMAS SADLER
City Editor

Citing the increasing crime
rate and growing competition,
Ralph Quackenbush §an-
nounced yesterday that he was
moving The HUB out of the
downtown area and into the
suburbs.

The move continues a
nationwide trend which has
seen both large and small
merchants flee from the inner
city for the more pleasant
atmosphere of suburbia.

‘‘Someone walked out the
other day without paying for
his hot dog and large root-
beer,’’ Quackenbush com-
mented. ‘‘The losses that
mount up in this way are too
great for the large business-
man to endure.”’

The growing crime rate, also
indicative of a national trend,
is attributed in part to the
negligence of the college stu-
cents who fail to pay for their
purchases.

“‘The honor system was
good while it lasted,’’ noted
another prominent merchant.
“But inflation and the reces-
sion ‘have hurt the college

student too. With tuition
costs as high as they are now,
the student has to cut back
somewhere.”’

Quackenbush also called the
competitive atmosphere in the
downtown area ‘‘too great for
the major food distributors.”’

He felt that moving should
serve to increase the business
for the remaining two busi-
nesses, while he hopes to
profit from the hungry mouths
located outside the thriving
megalopolis of Davidson-
Cornelius.

‘‘The coming area in the

suburban area of Davidson-
Cornelius is going to be the
Days Inn location at the
intersection of I-85 and N.v.
73,”’ Quackenbush explained,
with dollar signs flashing
wildly in his beady eyes:

“TI think the location is
desirable both from an eco-

nomic and safety standpoint.”
The downtown area has
been the scene of escape in
recent years. Most noticable
was the moving of the famed
Wildcat Den, which was rep-
laced by First Union National
Bank. It is expected that
several enterprises may follow
Quackenbush’s suit.

Piedmont Bank and Trust
may shift to a location on the
outskirts of Huntersville,
while Harris Teeter has exp-
ressed interest in bringing an
outlet into the Davidson
downtown area. Such a move
is contingent upon the ap-
proval of a parking lot to be
constructed on the Village
Green.

Regarding the increasing
crime rate, a spokesman for
the Davidson Police Force said
that every effort was being
made to apprehend the cri-
minals.

The spokesman said Quack-
enbush could not positively
identify the culprit, although
he has been eating at The

HUB for three yedts.

The police representative
cited the perfect record of the

Seven Eleven Food Store in
the Davidson-Cornelius area
as evidence of the fine work
being done by the force.

Campus security agents
have been alerted to beware of
any persons who look as
though they may have just
fled the scene of a meal
without paying.

Such persons are described
as being medium height and
weight, having a twinge of
onion on their breath, a slight
ring of mustard around their
lips, and a satisfied look on
their faces.

Quackenbush concluded by
saying that he would guaran-
tee a reward for any informa-
tion leading to the arrest and
conviction of any non-paying
eaters.

The monetary sum of the
reward consists of a weekly
milkshake for the rest of the
person’s academic career or-
four years, whichever comes
first.

‘“‘The results were orgas-

Gordon Widenhouse, com-
menting on the debate team’s
second-place finish in the

\North Mecklenburg High

School Invitational Debate
Tournament.

Widenhouse, with team
member Mark Gergen, bab-
bled his way into the finals
only to lose to Senior High
School in a split decision.

“Our record has improved

the Charlotte High School
circuit,’’ said Widenhouse,
“and since only freshmen and
transfer students debate on
our team, we had no trouble
convincing the Charlotte jud-
ges that we were as qualified
for this circuit as Johnson C.
Smith University.’’ The team
record has now improved to
8-5, with four new first place
trophies crowding the awards
cabinet, along with twelve
trophies for wins over Cat-
awba College.
