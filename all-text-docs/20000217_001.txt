Davidson constructs new residence hall

By Setu Davis
News Editor

A large wall, construction workers, and
the beginnings of the new dorm building
greet visitors to Davidson as they drive on
Glasgow Street, down past the Infirmary and
Richardson dorm.

Campus officials expect the construc-
tion costs to reach the four- to five-million
dollar mark. This figure, at present, is just an
estimate.

“We [don’t yet] know the firm estimate
for construction cost and debt service,” says
Kurt Holmes, Associate Dean of Students
and Director of Residence Life. Financing
for the project is coming from bonds and
residence life reserve funds.

The new residence halls is tentatively
scheduled for completion on August |. As of
last Friday, construction was one day behind
schedule due to a week of work lost during
the heavy snowfall last month.

The new residence hall will provide 128
new bed spaces on campus, helping to allevi-
ate a crowded campus that contained a record
1,602 students last spring.

The rooms

The new residence hall will be com-
prised of two distinct setups. Each hall will
include eight two-person suites, and sixteen
singles—eight on each end of the building.
Each suite consists of two bedrooms, a com-

mon area, and a bathroom shared
with the adjacent suite.

In addition to the suites, each of
the floors will feature eight single
rooms. The suites consist of two
bedrooms, a common area, and a
bathroom. The bedrooms in these
suites will be approximately 8’7” by
8°7”, while the common rooms in
these suites will be 13’ by 11°7”.

The suite design is based upon
the floor plan of dormitories at
Wofford College, but the size of
each room in Davidson’s version
will be notably larger. Nonetheless,
the suite bedrooms are not large
enough to contain a bed, desk, and
dresser—one of these pieces of fur-
niture will need to stay in the com-
mon area.

Many students have speculated
that this will pose an inconvenience.
“T really wish we could have both our desk
and our dresser in the bedroom,” said one
student.

On the ends of each hall, eight singles
will surround two common areas. Most of
these singles are generously apportioned,
measuring 12’5” by 9’.

The new residence hall has been de-
signed to carefully adhere to handicap acces-
sibility guidelines. The building will contain
an elevator that runs to every floor, and there
is a handicap-accessible suite on every floor.

The new dormitory will complement Belk as
the second fully-accessible residence hall on

~-carmipus:”

Other handicap amenities include a roll-
in-shower, a tub, and a transfer-shower in the
new dormitory. To date, two requests have
been made for handicap suites; but any handi-
capped-accessible rooms that are not required
for students with disabilities will roll over
into the general lottery pool.

Consistent with RLO’s efforts to en-
hance the community environment through-

out residence halls, each hall will contain
a hall-wide lounge.

While much of the design for the new
dorm is set in stone, certain features are
still up in the air. One of these features is

the furniture in the rooms. In order to
solicit student input, the Residence Life
Office set up a model room in Chambers
Gallery during January.
