Phillips Interviews For Nader
In Summer’s Congress Study

By HARRIETT HODGES
Staff Writer

Junior Bo Phillips got a close
look at the U. S._ political
process this summer.

Phillips worked as a member
of the Ralph Nader Congress
Project. an attempt to evaluate
the effectiveness of Congress as
a whole and Congressmen as in-
dividuals

As a member of the Foreign
Relations division. headed by
Davidson Political Science
Protessor Bill Jackson.
Phillips’ job was to interview
key members ot the
Congressional committees con-
cerning foreign policy

This was done in order to
learn the role of each man in the
committee.

Phillips spent much of his
time interviewing
Congressmen and members of
the congressional staff.

“Mostly. we went anywhere

Freshman Recess Changed

The Freshman Conference
Recess has been changed from
Oct, 26-27 to Nov. 6-7. Vice
President for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan has announced.

According to Bevan. fresh-
man faculty advisors during
this period will have the op-
portunity to discuss with their
freshmen any problems they
may have encountered during
their first six weeks at David-
son.
“I hope other faculty mem-
bers will be in their offices so
that upperclassmen can talk to
them about their programs.”
Bevan said.

In another matter. Bevan
said his office was launching a
campaign to interest Davidson
students in applying for un-

and everywhere for our in-
formation.” he said.

The Nader team ran into
many cases where people were
reluctant to be interviewed.
Phillips said. though only two
refused to cooperate at all and
“both of them were named
Barry Goldwater.”

On the other hand one Florida
Congressman gave a Nader
worker 12 hours ot his time

Phillips said that if the Nader
people “pressed hard enough
and showed that they) knew
somethin.” the Congressmen
showed respect. Bul. “whether
it Was respect or fear. vou never
really knew.

Phillips said that it took about
a month of encounters with the
people in Congress to “erase the
initial reaction that Nader was
releasing a bunch otf naive.
neophyte political scientists on
Capitol Hill.”

The treatment the group
received had nothing to do with
ideology. Phillips said. Whether
or not a Congressman was
liberal or conservative was not
an indicator of how he would
receive the Nader workers

Phillips said that Nader met
with the group about once every
two weeks. He tound Nader a
fascinating person

“One ot the things that im-
pressed me the most was his
sense of humor.” Phillips said.
“It’s hard to believe that
somebody can work that hard.
and have that much stamina

“Most of the people in the
project had an awtul lot. of
respect tor him.’ Phillips said

Phillips was told about the

dergraduate research grants.
According to him. no one has
applied for such a grant in
recent years.

Grants are awarded for
research done during the sum-
mer and during the academic
year. This year grants are
available to do research in
American art. anthropology.
physical sciences, the history of
science and_ technology.
American history. and the
humanities. Grants in other
fields are also available.

Deadlines for applications
vary. with some being Jan. 1.
Bevan said these grants were
“a tremendous opportunity.”
and he said departmental chair-
man could be contacted for fur-
ther information.

BRUCE MALOY
Asst. Managing Editor

Mike Grizzardistast earmnga
reputation as the handiest man
with a hammer in Belk Dor-
mitory due to the lofts or scaf-
folds he has been building for
his friends

One of the best examples of
his carpentry is a wooden plat-
form made of plywood and 2x4's
which holds the beds of Russell
Carter and John Williams about
eight feet off the floor leaving a
small room underneath.

Access is by a ladder which
goes through an opening in the
floor of the platform.

When asked why he wanted
the structure built. Carter said.
*‘We wanted to have the extra
space naturally. ‘We're getting
a couch for $3 and plan to make
a sort of den in the area under
the beds. Also, we're putting
one stereo upstairs and one
downstairs."

Grizzard said he plans to own
his own construction company
someday so he builds these
things to experiment

Referring to Bill Bales and
Bill Todd's room. which he also
renovated. Grizzard said,
“There's not a damn nail in the
wall or the tloor It took about
fifteen minutes to figure out the
lumber lengths that I would
need for the plans that I had in

my head.

“T had the wood cut at the
lumber yard and brought it
back here.” he said “It took
about. an hour and a halt to
assemble The only tool T used
Was a hammer.

Ronnie Hamilton and Henry
Barber are the proud owners of
another of Mike's creations
They have a sort of a bunk bed
arrangement with a water-
bed and frame on the bottom
and a double bed made from the
mattresses on top.

“We got it built to have a
frame for the waterbed and
room for an icebox and a
chair."’ Hamilton said. ‘This is
the perfect set-up for a water-
bed and it’s different from the
regular two-bed arrangement."

‘We put eight guys up on that
top bed.” said Grizzard. ‘and it
didn’t even creak.”

For his own room, Grizzard
has planned a three-level struc-
ture. The normal floor would
have a waterbed and trame.
Two higher levels reached by
steps would make up living and
study space.

Asked if he plans to keep on
building. Grizzard said. “So far
I've just built tor my triends.
but if someone else wanted
some work done I'd do it if I had
the time. These lotts only cost
about $35 to $40 and T really en-
joy building them ~

Short Drive Invites Adventure
In Picturesque Appalachians

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Staff Writer

Appalachia at its best is a lit-
tle over an hour's drive from
Davidson.

Picturesque 19th century
cabins and brick houses beside
one-acre corn patches.
dilapidated tobacco barns. and
local yokels abound.

The heavily forested moun—
tains are now nearing the peak
of their fall color

The circuit described below
can be made easily in a Satur-
day afternoon

Lenoir is at the foot ot the
mountain country. The eas—
‘lest way there is up I—77 to
Statesville. west on I—40 to
Hickory and up US 321 intotown

Turning right on NC 268
brings vou to an ordinary town
with the cliche name of HAP—
PY VALLEY. Farther up the
muddy Yadkin River you turn
lett on the road that runs by

Butfalo Creek

Rip Shin Mountain is on your
right. Earl Jones’ old bear
hound cut its leg on some
briers long ago to give the
mountain its name.

Buffalo Cove is further up
Buffalo Creek. Bear left. right,
and then left again at suc-
cessive junctions. Wrong tturns
invite hostile stares from the
locals, and lead by muddy trails
to stills way back in the forest.
or to the two house town of Dar-
by---the later not worth seeing.

The steep winding road looks
like intestines on a large scale
map. It soon levels off on Little
Dugger Mountain. The forest
here is composed of Maple.
Oak. Hickory. and some
Popular. Much of the area to the
east burned during the great
fire of 1943 of which the locals
still talk. These mountains are
reputed to swarm with deer and
bear. Be on the look out. ~

The dead end road which e-
xits right is well worth taking.
and gives views far over the
purple Globe Mountains from
the Mast Knob

After vou pass under the Blue
Ridge Parkway turn left at the
first paved raod and then left
again onto the dirt road back up
the ridge ‘under the parkway
again). This road comes out at
Bailey Camp on US 321. George
Bailey searched these moun-
tains for coal in the 1800's

Grandfather Mountain is the
prominent peak (5964) off to the
west. Grandmother-the small

Up NC 194 out of Boone a
paved road bears left and

Pleasant Valley and a “town”
named Meat Camp.

As you wind up along the

looms on your right. at 5547 feet
it is the highest in the area.
