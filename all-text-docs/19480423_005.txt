The idea of organizing the independents has been talked
out since fraternities were founded at Davidson about

ars ago, but it wasn’t until last year that any serious thinking
is done and not until this year that an organization was

actual inauguration of the club by
about two weeks.) In the talk he
did not mention that any concrete
plans were being made. He merely
stressed the need of an independent
organization which would extend to
all students the advantages of or-
ganized campus activity. His talk
was well received by everyone and
the group was encouraged to know
that the school would be in favor
of their project.

Then came the problem as
how to present the organization to
the independents. Following
Bailey's advice, the group decided
to start with a small nucleus which

would be officially underway. Im-

HOW TO JOIN

Any student of Davidson
College who is not a member
of a social fraternity is wel-
comed to join the Campus
Club.

The Club Constitution re-
quires that all candidates for
membership (1) read the con-
stitution, (2) write a brief let-
ter to the Executive Council
as application for membership.

Financially, the initiation fee
is $5.00, and the dues are $1.00
a month, Any student consider-
ing joining is invited to attend
one of our meetings any Thurs-
day at 6:30 p. m., in Carolina
Inn, or to contact the Secretary
of the Campus Club for in-
formation or copies of the con-
_stition in 305 Watts.
