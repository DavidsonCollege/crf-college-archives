Columnist speaks about technology,
government in 900 Room lecture

By ANDREW PRESTON
Staff Writer

Nationally syndicated colum-
nist and journalist Richard Reeves
spoke about “1996 Updates” in the
900 Room Tuesday night. Reeves
covered many topics in his speech,
including technology and the gov-
ernment.

One of the major topics
Reeves addressed was technology.
He pointed out that “90 percent of
the medicine today wasn’t avail-
able in.1950.” The problem with
this is that social security, medi-
care, and medicaid cannot handle
the cost to provide such techno-
logically-advanced medicine.

. Notonly does the cost of medi-
cine cause problems; so does the
fact that “people are living longer,
healthier lives, and these systems
can’t handle it.”

The U.S. Government was an-
other major topic. Reeves stated that
technology allows the government
to be more thorough in its polls and
has created a new breed of politi-
cians who rely on numbers. He
explained that the president has less
power than in previous years be-
cause technology allows the public
nearly as much information as the
president. “Sometimes the news

broadcasters know information be-
fore the FBI and the president,”
Reeves said.

As for Clinton’s presidency,
Reeves said he was “even less pre-
pared than most new presidents,
not that anyone really is prepared.”

Reeves believes that Clinton
needs a more organized plan or

format. Clinton is known to “go
to bed with one opinion and change
his mind in the morning,” he said.
Clinton has good instincts but is
vulnerable to criticism and believes
greatly in the polls. Despite his faults,
though, Reeves predicts that Clinton
will be re-elected because “he has
great political skill and is the least
objectionable alternative.”

A short question and answer
session followed the speech. One
member of the audience asked if
Colin Powell would run. Reeves
said he would not, simply because
it would be too difficult, not due to
race but because “he was raised in
New York City and still thinks like
a New York politician.”

A second question asked was
whether there would be any strong
third party candidates. Reeves said
that there probably would be, and
in fact that Clinton needs one of
these candidates to win because “‘it
is doubtful that he can get 50% of
the vote, but with a strong third
party he could get the most votes/’

Reeves graduated from
Stevens College with a degree in
engineering but says “less than
three years after I earned my de-
gree, Texas Instruments sold ev-
erything I knew for $10.” Reeves
added that he was offered a schol-
arship to Princeton, “but my girl-
friend wouldn’t let me go because
it Was too far away.” Reeves lived
40 miles from Princeton.

A prominent journalist,
Reeves has won an Emmy and
other awards for work in his field.
Currently, Reeves has two news-
paper columns in the New York
Herald Tribune.

Crop Walk raises over $3,000

By Anby, ARMSTRONG
Staff Writer.

Approximately 120 Davidson
students, faculty, and townspeople
came to together to walk to reduce
world hunger on Sunday, October
15.

The event was organized by
Kristina Taylor, with help from
Rachel Anderson and Smita
Donthamsetty. Though official
numbers are not available, the or-
ganizers speculate that the amount
raised was well over $3,000.

Registration began at | p.m.
on what many thought was a per-
fect afternoon, and though the

walkers were to begin at 1:30 p.m.,
many of the overzealous: walkers
began at 1:15 p.m.

The 10k walk began on the
Town Green, where it also ended.
Of the 120 people participating,
approximately half were Davidson
students, staff, and faculty. Sev-
eral area churches helped to recruit
volunteers from the community.

The turnout was higher than
organizers had expected. Those
walking ranged from the very
young to the very old.

The money raised serves two
purposes. Three-fourths of the
money raised will goto the Church

tion is a group comprised of 30 to
40 denominations around the world
which helps to provide food and

From there 83.9 cents per dol-
lar raised goes directly to aiding
Third World countries.

The remainder of the-money
raised will stay in Davidson and go
to the Senior Nutrition Center at
the Ada Jenkins Center.

Though the turnout was better
than expected, organizers are al-
ready thinking of ways to improve
next years event.

As one walker, senior Dave
Thompson, said, “It was an enjoy-
able time spent with friends for a
good cause.”

‘NEWS BRIEFS _

Seen and heard

“Being the cynic that 1 am, I don’t trust any administrators, and I don’t
think they should be trusted. I think they are running their own agenda
and not the students’ agenda,” the SGA Chancellor said in a rare
moment of candor in the SGA.

Admission statistics

There were more applicants for the Class of 99 than ever before, and
they brought with them the highest test scores ever. But all is not
necessarily well. The Office of Admission experienced a six percent
drop in yield last year. Yield represents the percentage of accepted
students who choose to enroll at Davidson. In the last 10 years the
yield has been between 45 and 48 percent. The Class of 99 enrolled

accepted off of the waiting list, compared to one for the Class of ’98.

Money watch

The SGA appropriated $560 to the Public Relations Committee which
is sponsoring the second SGA day on October 26. SGA Day events
will include a cookout on the Union patio from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., the
third town meeting of thé year covering academic affairs, a video
about the SGA to run on DCTV, and the distribution of an SGA
newsletter. The allocation was approved unanimously.

The SGA also approved unanimously $200 for the as-of-yet unsched-
uled Freshmen social.

The SGA allocated $150 for a reception after the candidates forum to
be held on October 30. The approval was unanimous.

CCRL appointments

Senior Peter Varney, Junior Seth Clippard, and Sophomore Humes
Franklin were appointed by the SGA to fill the three vacant spots on
the Council on Religious and Campus Life. The Council is composed
of faculty and students, some of whom are elected, others appointed,
and still others by virtue of their holding some other office . The three
were approved with two oppositions and nine abstentions.

Campus Police becoming more sensitive

In response to African-Americans being stopped on campus, a com-
mittee has been established to work with the Campus Police on the
situation. The Campus Police have begun sensitivity training as well.

Athletic Director search

The field of applicants to replace Terry Holland as Athletic Director
has shrunk from 90 to 10. The finalists will be on campus in the near
future for interviews.
