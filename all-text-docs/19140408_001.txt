resented by E. P. Yates and J. W.
Pritchard, with J. P. Mull as alternate.

A spectal train will leave Davidson
at 9:24 a. m. the day of the debate,
reaching Winston-Salem at noon. A
train will leave Winston-Salem the
same night just after the debate. The
rate for the round trip, good only on
the special trains, is $1.50. This will
give an opportunity to attend not only
the debate, but the base ball game be-
tween Davidson and Winston Salem
that afternoon.

The larger part of the student body
ought to be able to attend the debate,
with these low rates for the trip. Espe-
cially when the presence of a large stu-
dent backing will mean so much to
Davidson’s debaters. Each man should
use every effort to be there.
