Cabaret features '30s Kit Kat Club

By Laura Leibfreid

Cabaret. descended upon
Davidson with all of the spice and
splendor of a Broadway mainstage
production, The cast, belonging to
a company known as 3D II Inter-
national, Inc., played to a filled
Love Auditorium last Monday
night, as young and old gathered
together to enjoy the last of this
year’s spectacular Artists Series’
performances.

Bright red spotlights high-
lighted an exquisite backdrop,
adorned with classic ‘30s carica-
tures of sleazy men and buxom
broads. A small orchestra banged,
squeaked, and tooted the first re-
sounding tones ofthe evening, as
the audience waited restlessly for
the show to begin. Within mo-
ments, a curious mime-like char-
acter dressed in a tuxedo and top
hat, sprang forward with cane in
hand and identified himself as the
Master of Ceremonies.

He proceeded to welcome the
audience ina variety of languages,

his quirky gestures and facial ex-
pressions adding to the hilarity of
the song, “Wilkommen.” As the
tune progressed, singers and danc-
ers, clad in skimpy, voluptuous
attire, joined the emcee to end the
opener with an eruption of sound,
color, and movement.

Set in the late 1930s, Cabaret
celebrates the peak of Germany’s
popular nightclub decadence. Our
all-American hero, Clifford
Bradshaw, arrives in Berlin to write
a novel, not knowing he will soon

_ be swept into the clutches of the

carefree cabaret.

There, inasassy saloon called
the Kit Kat Club, Clifford meets
Miss Sally Bowles, a “wild and
unpredictable girl,” who promptly
decides to move in with “the Ameri-
can” in his newly acquired living
accommodations. As their unlikely
romance blossoms; another love
affair develops between the eld-
erly landlady, Fraulein Schneider,
and an admiring old gentleman,
Herr Schultz.

Tragically, the two pairs are
lost to one another with the coming
of the second world war. Fraulein
Schneider will not risk the pros-
perity of her inn by marrying Herr
Schultz, a Jew living within the
boundaries of Hitler’s Nazi Ger-
many.

Sally, too, cannot face the
unrest of the time; she ultimately
aborts the baby she and Clifford
were to have, refusing to escape
with him to America. In the midst
of political turmoil, she is deter-
mined to keep performing at the
Kit Kat Club while the rest of the
world crumbles at her feet.

Despite such an unlikely, re-
alistic ending, 3D II International,
Inc.’s performance was truly en-
joyable. The company’s showman-
ship and talent was quite impres-
sive. Each character, from the great
Clifford Bradshaw to the lowliest
of the Kit Kat Girls, played his or
her part to perfection. Cabaret
proved to be the culmination of a
wonderful year of entertainment.

This Davidson favorite has
maintained its status as the place to
go for the best environment and
the largest serving sizes. The out-
door seating and music give Caro-
lina Cones a competitive edge.
Also, the service is genuinely help-
ful. The vanilla ice cream was the
best we tested, with a luscious,
creamy texture. The chocolate has
no weakness, either; but CC is not
as chocolate-oriented as Baskin-
Robbins.

The flavors are not overly cre-
ative or exotic, as CC caters to old
favorites. Mint chocolate chip is
about as exciting as it gets. This
tradition carries over into their

movie selection, which includes
the classics, whether famous or
not. |

conversation and relaxation, and

The highly anticipated arrival
of this gourmet ice cream parlor

. last semester has not disappointed

anyone. After years of rumors,
Davidson’s wish finally came true.
The socially “cool” ice cream has
been a longtime favorite for
Davidson students mainly due to
the creative flavors like Chunky
Monkey, Cherry Garcia, and

_ Rainforest Crunch.

The variety offered in the store
is intriguing and brings out the
curiosity in any ice cream lover.

treats

However, the environment is
cramped and not very comfort-
able. While Ruskies may enjoy the
cow image, the company’s mascot
is overdone in the store’s decora-
tions and t-shirts.

The incredibly creamy texture
is one of the few which is literally
addictive. What other local ice
cream can you sit down and eat a
pint without remorse? You cannot
deny that B&J’s chocolate chip
cookie dough is the best around.

The vanilla was super, and the
chocolate was richer than most.
However, savor those bites, be-
cause you don’t get many in that
little cup, even with the exorbitant
prices. True B&J lovers will get a
unique chance to avoid the high
prices this Friday, when the store
holds a free ice cream day.

Musicians seduce audience

provided the highlights of the next
piece, “Take the A-Train.” Also
popular in the ‘30s and *40s, this
tune was one of Duke Ellington’s
signature works. The big finale for
the evening came from “Channel
One Suite,” one of Buddy Rich’s
best-known songs. This extremely
complex piece was divided into
“three sections with lots of time
changes.

The slow, pretty second sec-
tion featured great interplay be-
tween the guitar and tenor sax--

“Itis rather astounding to hear how
much talent sits up there for noth-
ing. It really is just for playing . .

. There is no reason for these
people to work as hard as they
work except for the fact that they

love to do it.” Lawing also pointed
out that the ensembles involved
more than just intense playing and
practicing. “We have a lot of fun,”
he said. “I’m very pleased with
how these groups have done this
year.”
