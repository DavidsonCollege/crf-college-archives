Thomas reduces cost and length of India program

By JIM GROWE
Staff Correspondent
South Asian Studies’ Profes-
sor Job Thomas has made the
Seminar in India Program
cheaper and more convenient
for Davidson students.

The revised Program, which
involves students from several
southeastern schools, will allow
students to study at Madras

-University from August
through November.

Formerly , the Program lasted
through December, forcing
Davidson students to miss two
terms.

Sewer bills to

By TIM WHALEN

One factor increasing David-
son’s comprehensive fee next
year will be a rise in water and
sewage bills, according to
Davidson Town Councilman

How much more the College
—and students—will pay de-
pends on the outcome of negoti-
ations between the town coun-
cils of Davidson, Huntersville,
Cornelius, and the Charlotte-
Mecklenburg Utilities Depart-
ment (CMUD). CMUD owns
the new regional sewage treat-
ment plant, located on McDow-
ell Creek.

Davidson will have to hook
into the new plant in July. On
July 1 the town’ will have to
stop using its local sewage
treatment plant because its
permit to do so expires then..

According to Kincaid, the
problem started when the towns
found out in 1978 that CMUD
charges county customers twice
city rates. In addition to paying
these rates, Davidson still had
to support its own collection
system.

Protesting the unfairness: of
this arrangement, the towns
suggested that CMUD buy the
collection systems so that
everyone paid city rates.

However, the Charlotte City
Council specified that. they
must approve any extensions
in the sewer system. In effect,
then, Charlotte could control
the towns’ development.

Davidson, Huntersville, and
Cornelius found so much out-
side control unacceptable.’ ~~

Later, according to The
Mecklenburg Gazette (Nov. 29,
1979), CMUD agreed to give
the towns some limited control
over extension policy.

Kincaid said, however, that
the talks are presently at an
impasse. The towns want both
city treatment rates and control
over their collection systems,
but Charlotte cannot afford to
. accommodate them.

All of this. means that the
College’s water and sewage bill
will rise. Kincaid said that
Davidson’s rates are ‘in line”
with CMUD’s city rates, but
the College is only charged
about 75 % as much as a regular
customer. If CMUD buys
Davidson’s system, the College
will :no longer get preferential
rates.

If Davidson ends up paying
twice city rates, the effect on
the College’s bill will be even
greater. According to Comp-

Under the revisions, Ameri-
can students will live at Madras
and take lectures and classes
with Indian students. Previous-
ly, students had been isolated
from university life. They lived
in ‘expensive hotels and took
special classes. Thomas feels
that greater contact with
Indian students and their cul-
ture will improve the American
students’ experience.

The switch to dorm life has
also allowed reduction in the
cost of the program from $4000
to $2500. In addition, the U.S.
government will provide sub-
sidies for use along with stud-

Thomas plans to use his
personal contacts with Madras
Christian College, rather than
depending upon the U. S. Edu-

an intermediary, as was neces-
sary in the old program. Mad-
ras Christian College, where
Thomas studied and later
served as director of public
relations, is a Scottish Presby-
terian school of 2000 students.
Thomas asserted that liberal
arts colleges like Davidson
must be more serious about
encouraging students to reach
beyond the Western tradition.
He said, ‘‘A Davidson student's
world is a small world.”
Thomas pointed to a lack of

Zoning‘laws force change in dorm
locations to behind Patterson Court

By ELIZABETH KISS
News Editor

The location of the two dorms
to be constructed by 1981 has
been changed to the hillside
behind Patterson Court across
from SAE and ATO.

Plans to build the dorms on
the site of Lingle Manor were
scrapped because of zoning
problems, according to Physical
Plant Director Grover Meetze.
The difficulty was that the
buildings would have been only
100 feet from the road, against
town zoning laws.

“Actually, the new site is the
best location in the whole area
for a dormitory,”’ said Meetze,
“it’s high, there are trees, and
the topography is good.’ The
site is now undergoing salt
tests.

Meetze said the dorms would
not be too far from the center of

campus, requiring at most. a
five minute walk to Chambers.

“Eighty-five percent of the
student body participates i in
intramural sports,’’ Meetze
pointed out, ‘‘A five minute’
walk shouldn't cause any prob-
lems.”’

The new location also fits in
with plans to eventually build
five dorms around the outside of
Patterson Court, enabling the
college to increase enrollment to
1600.

‘All of our planning is toward
1600 students,’ Meetze said.

However, College President
Samuel Spencer qualified the
statement. ‘There is no plan to
increase (enrollment) in the
forseeable future,’ he said,
‘These two dorms are needed to
alleviate the present housing
problem.’’

Additional housing, Spencer
said, is a long-range goal. “‘It’s

‘a question of 10-20-30 years.”
