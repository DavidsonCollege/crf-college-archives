Holland Points Cagers To Tournament |

By A. W. TURNER
Asst. Sports Editor

After a few early season
struggles plus one loss, the
Davidson, basketball team
seems to be off and running
to another fine season and
yet-to-be-knownm post season
honors.

“The team is at least as
far along as we expected,”
said head coach Terry Hol-
land, “Especially when you
take into account the loss of
Ron Stelzer.’ Despite the ab-
sence of ‘the small point man
in six of the team's eleven

games, the Wildcats have
run up an impressive 11-1
won-loss record. -

Holland added, “We didn't
get the breaks when we need-
them,"’ and Davidson return-
ed to the South smarting

night at the Palestra in Phil-

Despite McKinney's pessi-
mistie words, the Hawks re-
turned four of last year’s
starters and have compiled
a. winning mark, defeating
highly regarded teams such
as Cincinnati and Colorado
while falling to St. Bonaven-
ture.

Leading the Hawks are Dan
Kelly, a 5'll’’ guard, and
Mike Houer, a 6'4"’ forward.
Kelly has been hitting at a
21.2 point per game clip
while Houer has contributed
19 points and 12 rebounds.

Rounding out the starting
team are returnees John
Connolly and Jack Snyder
and 6'7"' center Bruce Marks.

Connolly is the number two
rebounder with eight a game.

The Hawks normally de-
ploy in a 2-1-2 offense with

Marks at the high post. They «

or else try to hit from the
outside with Kelly. St. Jo-
seph's likes to run when they
have the opportunity, but
have encountered troubles
on the defensive boards.

Houer is a big, strong re-
bounder on the lines of Doug
Cook, but is not an excep-
tional leaper. In fact ~Mc-
Kinney said that Houer can
not even dunk the ball.

chief weakness of the team
has been the disappointing
play of the other three start-
ers. The biggest strong point
has been the play of Kelly

IMAC Favorites
Roll In Openers

By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor

All the favorites won their
opening games as the IMAC
basketball league began ‘its
season on Wednesday night
with a slate of six games.

The preseason favorite Phi
Delts won their opener over
the Betas, 6041. Both teams
played poorly, but the Delts’
inside strength and defensive
play stopped the Betas.

The Delts played nearly
everyone who dressed out,
and John Porter, Ed Dobbs,
Gene Early, and Garth
Hampton tied for scoring
honors with ten points each.
John Baker was high for the
Betas, and also~ had ten
points.

The Pikas also won their
initial contest, over the In-
dependent A team, 75-55.
The Pikas pulled away to
a 17-point halftime margin,
over the highly improved In-
dependent team, then they
coasted to victory.

All five Pikas starters
scored in, double figures.
Floyd Strand led the way
with 21 points, followed by
Mark Affeldt with 19, Jack
Ballenger with 12, Joe Lan-
singer with 11, and Gary
Scibal with 10.

Jim May and Dave Was
serman were high for the
Independents with 14 and 12
points respectively.

night the ATO's edged the
KA's, 70-66. A last second

win. Montgomery and Bob

Starting team fouled out, as
the Wildcats won 91-76.

Davidson needed their foul
shots to hold off the Pirates
in the first half as East Caro-
lina hit on 57.6 percent of
their shots. The Pirates held
their last lead in the game
with 1:18 to go in the half.

For the Wildcats the story
of the game was once again
a balanced attack with four
players in double figures.
Doug Cook led the way with
26 followed by Brian Adrian
at 20, Mike Maloy with 19
and Jerry Kroll with 13.

point of our season,"’ said
Holland. He cited the great
improvement in defense that
was evident in this win.

Since then Davidson has
been untouchable. except
for the first half of the
George Washington game, the
‘Cats have appeared worthy
of their recent eighth place
national ranking.

“Playing together more
and more has effected a
great improvement in our de-
fense-as well as our offense,”
continued Holland. “*‘And I
still don't think we've reach
ed our peak. Of course, we
want to be at our peak at
the end of the season for the
post season tournaments.

“We-have not changed our
offense from the first of the
season. We still feel that the
most important thing is to
have our big men in good re-
bounding position. Bryan
(Adrian) is. such a great
free lance player that we
have not had to alter it to
give him more shots. We let
free lance within the struc
ture of the offenSe, and he'll
get the shots.’

Many fans do not feel that
All-American a A Maloy

is playing as well as he
should. ‘We feel that Mike
is more of an All-American
this year than he was last
year,’ commented Holland.
“Mike is not concentrating
quite enough, but he is a
very unselfish | player.”'
Holland noted Maloy's pef-
formance in the romp over
V. M. I. In the previous con
test, he had tallied a career
high of 36 pointsagainst
George Washington, but a-
gainst the Keydets, he scor-
ed only nine points, prefer-
ring to pass off to Adrian
and Doug Cook for easy bas-
kets. ‘‘Mike does not mind
passing up his own shots in
order to give teammates an
easier shot,’’ Holland went
on. ‘He is also a great lead-
er off the court. He really
worked to get the team up
for the game."

There is a__ possibility
that the team will have a

Now, the purpose of this hype is to get you to talk your folks into
financing a4ittle- getaway to the-mountains. Read_on,

Being from the South, when you think of skiing, you naturally think
of water skiing. Forget it. This is snow skiing. The best. Ah, but you
say that that means Vermont or Colorado or some other foreign
place like that? Nope.

We mean Beech Mountain, N.C. Yeah, North Carolina. Beech has
the highest slopes east of the Rockies, and that includes Vermont.
And Beech has ten different slopes, from beginner to advanced,
with lifts to service each one. There are cozy places where you can
get some good chow and something to drink, or maybe just sit
around and get warm.

Beech also has a lot of single people all over the mountain, all
winter long. If you are male, that means that there are a significant

vice versa, if you can dig it. If you don't know how to ski, we'll teach

you. If you don't have any equipment, we'll rent it to you, cheap. »
If you do have your own equipment, what are you waiting for?

*.

So here's the pitch: Beech Mountain features a gift certificate which
entitles you to two days of skiing. The package includes your lift
fees and complete equipment rental. All for under thirty dollars.

(A lot less if you have your own skis and stuff.) You'll also get a
jacket patch and a button which bears the catchy, ad game phrase

what's happening.
