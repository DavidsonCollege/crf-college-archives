been no such concern located here.

“CAPS AND BELLS” COMBINED TOWN IMPROVEMENTS MADE

on originality this year than in the
past. This they intend to make a
larger factor in the judgment of the

COACH YOUNGER’S MACHINE

(Continued from page 1)

Every flaw detected in the running
of the eleven against the Christians was
noted by, Coaches Younger and Tilson.
The afternoon practices this week haye
found the entire squad working over-
time to condition themselves for the
coming’ fight. The importance of the
game and the value of a win from
P. C. means much to Davidson. The
players and coaches, realizing this, have
been working, in earnest to prepare for

) the battle which promises to be a fight

to the finish.

P. C. will have another good ma-
chine, according to the dope from
Clinton. Coach Walter Johnson, looked
upon by the South Carolinians as the
“Miracle Man in Football,” is expected
to put out a strong eleven against the
Wildcats Friday at Rock Hill. The
game will be P. C.’s first of the season.
It will be Davidson's second. P. C.
has a coach who has been in the habit
of picking a team capable of ruining
the reputations of its opponents. The
material for a good eleven at that in-

‘stitution this fall is more than prom-

ising.

P. C. has lost five letter mén through
graduation. Williamson and Brown,
guards; Wade, tackle; Clowny, end,
and Wilson, backfield man, will don
the blue jerseys no more, Clinton and
Robertson, backs; Martin, Edwards,
Brown, Campbell, Bailey, Black, Fer-
guson, Holland, Rucker and Sistay are
being counted upon to uphold the repu-
tation of pep abuet Presbyterian .
team this year. ts

Scores of battles fought during the
past four years are: 1919, P. C., 0;
Davidson, 0; 1920, P. C., 7; David-
son 0; 1921, P. C. 0; Davidson, 7;
1922, P. C., 8; Davidson, 7. The last
game, accounted above, was bitter, too
bitter, for the Davidson student body.
With this disappointing battle in mind,
the Wildcats will be found scrapping
with all their efforts put forth Friday.
