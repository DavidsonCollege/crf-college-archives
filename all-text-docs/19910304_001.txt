Trustees Announce Tuition Increases

By Sean Lind

On February 25, the College
mailed letters to students and par-
ents announcing tuition increases
for the 1991-2 academic year.

The budget, approved by the
Board of Trustees last week, in-
cludes the following: Required
Charges (including tuition, laun-
dry and activity fees) are $13,600;
Room is $2060; and Meals are
$2100 (this charge applies only to
students taking the 19-meal plan
with the Commons.) This comes
to a grand total of $17,840.

The new budget is a $1546
increase over last year’s budget of
$16,294. This represents an over-
all increase of 9.5%, almost the
same rate of increase as the last
two years.

Associate Dean of Financial
Aid Gordon Peck sfated that “An
increase in financial aid will keep
pace with the increase in fees.”
According to Peck, 17-18% of
tuition revenue is returned to the
College for financial aid.

The one persistent problem
appears to be “middle-income

melt,” according to Peck. Those
families with. incomes. from
$35,000 to $70,000 are often hurt
by tuition hikes because they earn
just enough to make them ineli-
gible for financial aid, but not
enough to enable them to easily
absorb the increase in cost.
President Kuykendall stated
that the College is "making an effort

to discover a way to help these

families." In the future, Davidson
is considering a loan fund or a Col-
lege management fund to help
students with financial need.

Davidson Holds Post-War
Middle East Conference

By David Thompson
On Saturday, March 2, the
Student Government Association
of Davidson College hosted a
conference to discuss several as-

pects of the seemingly concluded -

war in the Middle East. Approxi-
mately 30 students, faculty mem-
bers, and Davidson residents at-
tended the round-table discussion
at 1:00pm in the 900 Room of the
College Union.

Sarah Sadowski opened the ~

discussion by asking the partici-
pants to express their thoughts
regarding the use and manipula-
tion of language throughout the
conflict.

Dr. Gail Gibson of the English
department spoke about the vari-
ous euphemisms employed by both
the military and the media. “We

find euphemisms as a matter of-

policy,” shesaid, “but it’s also part
of a psychic strategy. It’s very
difficult to face the horrors of war,

and these are ways of dealing with
it.” Dr. Ralph Levering, of the
History department, humorously
noted that “there’s nothing like a
group of academics for euphe-

‘Gibson went on to discuss the
metaphors which have character-
ized this war, and how they have
influenced civilian perception of
the events in the Middle East.

Pledge Wars Get Out Of Control

By Gary Wheeler

Fraternity pledge class rival-
ries are nothing new to Davidson.
This year, however, pranks and
retaliations, or “paybacks,” have
escalated to an unacceptable level,
says Dean of Students Will Terry.

Last weekend, a box of the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity’s
pledge manual, The Phoenix, was
taken from the Union Desk. Tues-
day morning, the SAE lion was
found buried and painted in front
of Chambers by the ground’s crew

On Sunday night, the Kappa
Alpha house received an unsolic-
ited paint job. The most visible
graffiti on the house reads, “SAE,
KA sucks,” and, on the roof, “Phi
Alpha”, a Sigma Alpha Epsilon
greeting phrase.

Terry warns that incidences
like these, while they may be infre-
quent, are nevertheless high-pro-
file. “There are a lot of people at
Davidson who don’t like fraterni-
ties, so this type of thing does not
play well for fraternities. It seems
thatthe peopleinvolveddon’tknow
when enough is enough.”

For the most part, however,
pledges of the fraternities seem to
enjoy their rivalries. John Allen
94, a KA pledge, says, “We have
fun. We love SAE, and we gotoall
their parties. The only thing bad i is
when fights break out.”

Allen also said that rivalries
are generally kept'in perspective.
“Friendship comes first, then fra-
ternity.”

He also feels that the special
rivalry KA and SAE have bring

their respective pledge classes
closer together. “Our pledging is
more difficult [than at other frater-
nities] and that makes us tighter,
maybe arrogant is another way of
putting it.”

Jim Vincent’94,aSAEpledge,
said that he did not take pledge
pranks personally. Vincent said that
if someone stole his Phoenix that
he would not consider it an Honor
Code violation. “I just take it with

a fraternity mind-set and get them
[the rival fraternity pledges] back.”

When asked where he would
draw the line between rivalry and
destruction, Vincent said, “Mess-
ing with fraternity symbols is ac-
ceptable, but I would never ruin
someone’s [another fraternity’s]
stereo or other expensive stuff.”

Terry, however, is apparently
fed up with the destruction that has
already taken place this pledge
season. “The word is out to the
parties involved: ifthey don’tclean
up their act they can expect to
cease pledge activities for the year,
and may even jeopardize their
ability to pledge students next
year,” Terry warned.

Some fraternities avoid intense
rivalries with other pledge classes.
Jason Phillips ’92, a pledge trainer
for Kappa Sigma, said that KS
does not want to getinvolved in the

“payback” routine. “If pledges start.

having rivalries, it [the division
caused by rivalries] carries into
brotherhood.

Rivalries may have an affect
on bonding, but overall they are
negative.”
