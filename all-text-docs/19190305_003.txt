Fellows, there is a Golf club at Da-
vidson! It belongs to the college and
the college has turned it over to the
students to make it a success, Up to
this time its success has been complete,
enjoyed both by the faculty and stu-
dents, and now stands as one of the
few courses in North Carolina that has
its head up in the financial line.

Why is. golf taste becoming the na-
tional pastime? Because old and young
can, alike partake of its pleasures, Every-
where it is taking its stand. “The game
can be learned easily, and has only to be
played once to bring the player over

among the horde of golf enthusiasts. If]

WILLIAM LOVE, EX-'20,
WRITES OF EXPERIENCES

Through the courtesy of one of the
students She Davidsonian is publishing
a few extracts from a letter received
frum William Love, ex-'20, who enlist-
ed in the Marines last May, and has
now been in France several months.

“AL EL F., A. P.O. 205,
“France, Jan. 26. 1919.

“We landed in Brest the latter part
of September, and remained in a ‘rest”
camp there for about a month. We
laid our blankets down on the ground.
in our little ‘pup’ tents, and that was
‘all the bloomin’ hole we could find.’
For rest and recreation we could. slip
up and down the hillside in the mud.

“Instead of going to the front though,
when we moved, we went to Bordeaux.
We rode in freight cars, bearing the
legend, ‘forty men, cight horses.’ Horses
are lucky over here—only eight of them
to a car, and forty of us. We were
about two days on the train, passing
through Nantes and LaRochelle. 1 saw
some pretty country along in there—that
is, when | was fortunate enough to look
out of the window. I hope to get to sce
more before | have to cross the raging
foam on my way back home. But if it
must be seen under such circumstances
as was the last—Oh, France, thy beau-
ties fade!

“Our cmpany was assigned to guard
the American docks at Bossons, six miles
down the river from Bordeaux. Here
we have been and continue ta be. We
are pretty well fixed up with big tents.

tan lot!

I've been doing lately:

Harry Lauder could not write a baok,
any more than he could give one of his
inimitable entertainments, without mak-
ing humor bubble all through it. Mans
times you will close the valume on your
fingers and sitting quietly, let the fun ot
the thing play all through your anatoon
with that pleasurable agitation — that
nothing but real humor can produce,
There is, however, far more than humor
here. ‘The deepest, tenderest pathos
(humor's tearful twin-sister) is met on
almost every page.

‘The book had its birth in the pang:
ofa father’s grief for a son fallen in ac
tion—it could not but register suffering
The marvelous way in which a suffering
heart opens itself to its like-suffering fel
lows as avery fountain of ‘sympathetic
comfort, makes the book a study in’ the
psychology both of sorrow and of com-
fort.

If you wish to see an artist's soul dis-
closed, read it. Hf you wish to see a
brave man with a breaking heart stand
up and make other men with agonizing
souls, for a little, forget their heart
breaks: if you wish to learn how fathers
love their sons, read it. 1) you wish an
insight to the life of soldiers in the
trenches; if you wish to have your faith
in man's immortality strengthened, then
read this book.
