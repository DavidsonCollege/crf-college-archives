England Year Abroad Delights J Y Aers

(Ed note: This story is the
first in a four-part series dealing
with the Junior Year Abroad
Experience. It focuses on the
experiences of three Davidson
students who spent the past
academic year in England.

Waking up in the morning
was always a fine way to start
the day on Tiree Isle,
Argylishire Scotland. One
knew the sun had risen because
that was the hour at which the
hordes of Highland Flies were
beginning to arouse them-
selves; one also knew when
10:00 had rolled around because
that was the hour at which the
winged pests worked up the
pluck to explore the state-bar
caverns of the morning-after
sleepers’ mouths.

So, unzip, and roll out of both
bag and tent to face the glare of
the cloudless sky and the wrath
of the rest of the isles’ 10,000,000
flies.

Cleanliness is next to
Godliness - even when roughing
it away from Mother and the
girl next door - so down the blue-
green North Atlantic, down

through the fields of clover,

down _ past dozing cows
(treading warily) to the sand
and salt and the suds.

And it was cold. But so real.
Breakfast then of Spaghet-

tio’s . . . with last night’s Irish
Stew in the corner of the pot.
And then, a little frisbee with
the flies - but blazing hell!

Time flies as well and only 30
minutes 'till closing time at the
Scarnish Pub 10 miles away.

Needless to say we made it -
one always makes it when a pint
of Tartan Special is at stake -
but barely for Hefty was tap-
ping the last draught, Donna
Reed picking up the last of the
foam-speckled glasses, Blondie
coaxing the last local into
leaving .

The Three Sisters, soon to be
immortalized at the Fifth An-
nual Tiree Isle ‘Queen of the
Island’ Dance and_all-local-
girls-welcome-no-experience-
necessary Beauty Pageant, to
be held that very eve at the
Crosspol Community Meeting
Hall.

And so it goes, the life of a day
and a day in the life of the foot-

loose and fancy-free Davidson
JYAers on summer vacation in

Britain. But the dream is over;
here we are back at Davidson
in October.

As always seems to be the
case in the autumn of the year,
one finds himself barraged by

an avalanche of information (or
bull? ).
Our concern is to acquaint you

with the vast potential of spen-
ding a year in England
(hopefully information, not
bull). So from our perspective
of a year in England, we would
like to add two bits.

Planning for and taking a
year away from Davidson is not
nearly so difficult a proposition
as you may think. Davidson
does not offer an organized JYA
program in England but such
can be a real benefit for the en-
terprising individual (all that

The Tacky Club’s Travelogue

By BOB HOWELL

(Ed Note: Former Managing,
Editor Bob Howell is studying
this yearin Montpelier, France.)

So it was beginning, a year in
France — dream come true and
all that. And if the best thing
about Davidson is the year you
spend away from it in Europe,
the second best thing would be
getting there by ship.

We sailed from New York,
some of us still dazed from a
first encounter with The City,
and soon found how easy it was
to get lost on that 900 foot puzzle
of decks, halls, and stairways.
The second thing we realized
was that it wasn’t French we
should've been studying all that
time, ...Yes, theS. S. Raffaello
is an Italian Lines ship.

On first night out several
decided it would be right to stay
up and watch the sun rise -—
which, due to considerable
haze, it never really did. The
feat became characteristic, a
sort of symbolic action, and the
Tacky Club was born.

Consisting of Hard-Core
Tackies and Soft-Core Tackies,
the T. C. was essentially part
ugly American and part Crazy
Davidsonian.

The T.C. in time enjoyed
numerous episodes, something
along the lines of the “‘Gidget”
series, and to some this article
represents the first installment
of a Tacky Travelogue. (Be on
the lookout for ‘“‘The Tacky
Club Gets Dysentery.”’)

A strong undercurrent of the
ship’s operation was an op-
pressive class system, and we
found ourselves on the bottom
end of the first Class/cabin
class/tourist class syndrome.

To right this wrong, an
authentic class movement
arose, under the fervent in-
spiration of David Ward and
Robin Atkinson. These
dedicated revolutionaries made
daily advances into first class
territory, walking through their
lounges and sitting in their deck
chairs. (Viva la_ classe
touristica! )

Part of the excitement of the

voyage was watching how
quickly rumors could grow and
spread. For example, it was in-
deed true that several areas of
Italy had reported cases of
cholera.

It was not true, however, that
the disease had increased to
epidemic’ proportions
throughout Europe. Nor was it
true that the S.S. Michelangelo,
carrying Professor E.F.
Jacobus and family, had been in-
fected and therefore could not
land at Cannes, leaving us com-
pletely alone in Europe and our
beloved advisor floating around
with a bunch of sick Italians.

But we had a lot of people
believing it was so.

Finally we landed in Cannes,
made our way safely through
customs and found the bus to
Montpellier, utterly amazed
that the French they teach in
American classrooms is ap-
proximately the same as the
French spoken in France.

University

By JIM JERNIGAN
(Ed Note: Davidson student
Jim Jernigan is presently at-
tending the University of Zam-
bedia in Lusaka. This story
deals with Zambia's developing
Nationalistic spirit, exemplified

in its educational growth.)

The University of Zambia

Lusaka reflects the nation’s ef-
fort to stand on its own feet af-
ter years of foreign political
domination. and continued

from Britain in 1964 there
existed only 100 Zambian
university graduates in a
tion of 4 million. Zaire,
by contrast, had 13 graduates
out of 13 million. The tremen-
dous manpower shortages
created by the vacating ex-
patriates necessitated a rapid
expansion of educational op-
portunities for all Zambians.

In a few hours we rolled into
Montpellier, trying not to gape
but gaping like the first tourists
Europe had ever seen, trying to
realized that this would be our
home for a year, trying not to
wonder exactly what it would be
like or whether we could make
it.

Soon we were more or less in-
to an intensive course of
language, literature and
civilization along with more
than a hundred other people
from all parts of the world,
most of whom, it seemed, spoke
pretty decent English.

So in between finding and

ment know we are here and

In 1965, the University of
Zambia was founded. Her first
students graduated in 1968 and
her first doctors graduated this
past July. The present
enrollment is 2500 and it con-
tinues to rise.

Naturally, the University
wishes to become African in
personnel, thought and actions.
Zambian Masters and Phd
degree holders are virtually
non-existent, however. Those
Africans that do possess ad-
vanced were educated
at Cambridge or the University
of London. The curriculum and
administrative structures are
consequently British in orien-
tation.

Goals are formulated to make
the University an African in-
stitution. Yet many students
wonder exactly what an
‘African Institution’’ really
means. Does it mean doing
away with the comprehensive
exams, rewriting textbooks or
establishing a free University?

From Abroad —

Means is: can you write a few
letters? ).

Send your letter (remember
to tell them you're an “‘oc-
casional”’ (visiting) student) to
the office of admissions. What’s
that . . . you’ve been through all
that just one year ago to David-
son? There is a difference; the
applications are short and there
is no clerical fee.

Financially speaking, the cost
of a year in England - including
getting there, traveling and an
occasional pint of beer (a
cultural necessity) - is sub-
stantially less than that of a
year here.

Especially if pints of beer are
consumed in moderation and if
Arthur Frommer es travel
economics are taken to heart.

Speaking from personal ex-

Mirrors Zambia’s Emergence

In reality the University is
striving quickly to replace
foreigners with Zambians, i.e.
Zambianization. Despite some
changes, the jobs today’s
students will fill are European
jobs needing European skills.
The curriculum is structured
accordingly.

The first and second year
students are either in the School
of Natural Science of the School
of Humanities. Except for a
mandatory African Studies
course, the two schools never
overlap.

Science students typically
take physics, chemistry,
biology and math for the entire
year. It is not uncommon to find
a student having four labs a
week. Many students even com-
plain about the African Studies
program because it is so dif-
ferent from their basic course
of study.

The School of Humanities is
quite comprehensive and
African in scope. Hard looks in-

perieuce, even the most ardent
pre-science major, assuming he
is of determined devotion and is
willing either to suffer
through the humid trauma of
summer school or double up on
a few lab courses, can achieve
the blessing of a Junior Year
Abroad.

Beware! Davidson’s
registration method of learning
is replaced in England by an
exam-free independent study
seminar approach. Seminars
replace lectures; discussions,
sleepy note taking ; wide outside
reading, yellow highlighting.

To say that our English ex-
perience was the greatest (most
influential, most enlightening -
even most eniovable) of our 21
years would be an_ un-

The Education department is
particularly stressed. The
quality of Zambian primary
and secondary education ac-
tually decreased after in-
dependence. Many more
schools were actually

Many more schools were built
than teachers provided to staff
them. Much of the huge
educational expenditures in
recent years has gone to hiring
expatriate teachers at high
European prices.

Zambia’s economy is almost
totally dominated by the copper
mining industry. The School of
Mines is therefore in top
demand by students who know
that their future will be secure
in the mines. At least half of the
