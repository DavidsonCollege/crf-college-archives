"Mideast Peace Talks: Land For Peace. .. NOT!"

By Rami El Amine

This article first appeared in
The Tongue, but because ofa mis-
understanding between the writer
and the editors it did not appear as
it should have. I also felt that I
needed to get the word out to more
people so that for once justice
rather than special interests would
be the decisive factor in Congress.

Back in November, Peter Jen-
nings came on the air following the
segment covering the last day of
the Middle East peace talks held in
Madrid and added, almost as a
footnote, that Israel had carried out
several air raids on the “suspected”
headquarters of guerilla organiza-
tions operating in southern Leba-
non. If you had not paid attention
for the mere three seconds in which
it was reported, you might have
missed it altogether (unless you
are an avid newspaper reader and
read about itin the New York Times
two days later).

The fact is, the bombings had .

been going on since day one of the
peace talks and, as with every raid
ona guerilla group, innocent civil-
ians were killed . Israel justified
the raids with the same backwards
logic; the raids were carried out in
retalliation to “terrorist” attacks on
Israeli military posts. What is
alwatys left out, however, is that
these military posts are in Leba-
hese territory occupied by Israel.
Therefore, these guerilla fighters
are fighting to regain land which
was illegally taken from them.
What is more important is that
while innocent people were being
killed, the Arab delegations at the
talks (of whom the Palestinians
were represented by a joint Jorda-
nian-Palestinian delegation rather
than their own because that is what
Israel wanted) were still arguing,
almost 45 years and thousands of

deaths later, that the land belonged
to them, rather than confronting
Israel on such concrete issues as:

-rejecting U.N resolutions 242
and 338, which calls for Israeli
withdraw] from the occupied terri-
tories in return for a pledge of
peace by the outlying Arab coun-
tries, after insisting on them for so
long.

-increasing settlements in the
West Bank, depriving the Pales-
tinian people of an education
(Palestinian Universities were
closed down in 1987 because Is-
rael felt that they were a breeding
ground for protest).

-deporting suspected leaders
of the intifada, holding others with-
out a trial and harassing, gasing,
beating, and killing the remaining
Palestinian population under oc-
cupation.

Needless tosay, the talks ended

with Israel not budging on its new

policy of no land for peace and the
Arab leadership making no real
effort on behalf of the Palestinians
who were “notreally” represented.
The parties couldn’teven agree on
where the next meeting would be
held.

The truth of the matter is that
Israel is not going to ever concede
any land, let alone grant the Pales-
tinian people autonomy until the
United States forces it to. One
must understand that Israel’s
change of heart with respect to
land for peace is not due to solely
to their right wing politics, but to
economic considerations as well.

Before citing these considera-
tions, it is important to note that, in
the past, Israel has used national
security as a justification of its
occupation of Palestine, Lebanon,
and Syria (sound familiar?).

unanimous view of the entire faculty, which creates a bitterness that I had
never experienced until this year. This is unnecesary.

I think acrucial step in truly rebuilding community would be a good
faith effort on the part of all members of the community to treateveryone
as an equal, and not as an intellectual, or moral, or social superior. I
would urge that instead of creating more regulations to govern student
life, administrators ought to reaffirm the policy of freedom and respon-
sibilty in student living--to concede, for example, that the dorms are the
students’ “homes,” and that we have the responsibility of treating our

neighbors with respect. I would urge that instead of appointing faculty- .

chaired committees to bring about change, allow the student body to
elect a commission with the authority to re-write the alcohol policy, for
example. I feel that at this point, anything is worth a shot: student
creativity could be the answer. As of now, the trend towards INLOCO
PARENTIS is propelling us backwards.

However, the Gulf War (Opera-
tion “Massacre” for all of you who
have forgotten) and statements by
retired Israeli Generals, who are
members of the Jewish Committe
on the Middle East (JCOME), have
refuted such a claim.

This leaves us to as the ques-
tion of why the Israeli government
insists on keeping the lands?

First of all, the influx of Soviet
Jews (around 200,000 in 1990) has
presented the Israeli government
with a land and housing crisis.
Where better to get land to build
houses than the West Bank, the
Gaza strip, and the Golan Heights
where there are already settlements,
but not nearly as many as we have
seen since the influx of Soviet
immigrants.

Secondly, Israel suffers from
water shortages. It has always
relied on desalinization plants to
meet this water shortage, but they
arecostly and inefficient. Water in
the West Bank is, on the other
hand, plentiful and accessible by
Middle Eastern standards. The
West Bank has, therefore, become
a major source of water for Israel.
_ §ince the 1982 invasion of
Lebanon and the consequent es-
tablishment of the so-called “secu-
rity zone” extending five miles into
southern Lebanon, Israel has ac-
quired a third source of water: the
Litany river. Enormous “sucking”
machines now draw water from
the Litany (which, consequently,
used to meet most of southern
Lebanon’s water needs) back to
Israel. (Its quite ironic that the
very same water which sustains us
goes to nourish the people who in
turn oppress us).

Finally, the Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza strip not only
provide Israel with a large market,
but also with a large pool of cheap

labor.

So it was no surprise to learn
that when the Arab delegations
showed up at the State Department
on December 4 to continue the
talks, the Israelis had decided not
toattend until next Monday. Their
explanation was that they refused
to be forced into negotiations by
the U.S.

In the end they did show up
but, as expected, nothing has be-
come of these talks which are
meeting again in Washington.
What has “become”, however, is
going on outside the talks and is
more crucial to peace than the talks
themselves. And here I ask you to
join me in doing something about
the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in-
stead of simply making a judge-
ment on the whole dilemma and
easing your burdened consciences.

What I am talking about is the

$10 billion loan guarantee which *

is pending approval in Congress
this month. The Bush administra-
tion has already made it clear that
it will not approve the guarantee
unless all illegal settlements are
stopped. Of course this says noth-
ing about 65% of the land in the
West Bank and 50% of the land in
Gaza which hasalready been seized
by the Israeli authorities, but it’s a
Start.

Your job is to write to your
Congressman, Senators, and the
President (orcall at 202-456-1111)
and ask that they not allow the loan
guarantee to be passed. Why? Here

‘are some reasons:

-the loan guarantees pay for the
occupation of land and, in turn,
impedes peace in the region.

-$4.1 billion, 30% of the foreign

aid bill, was earmarked for Israel, °

which makes up .001% of the
world’s population, in the 1991

fiscal year. This, I remind you, is

a grant.
-though the $10 billion is)a loan
guarantee and not a loan, the US
government would still have to set
aside an additional $800 million to
$1 billion from the foreign aid bill
to Israel.

This might seem irrelevant to
those of you who feel that the
American government will act in
our best interest, but if you con-
sider the economic problems we
are facing at home you will realize
where the need is greatest. If Israel
defaults on its payments, which is
very likely considering Israel’s
present budget deficit, it will be
coming out of our taxes

Finally, I do not want to come
across as saying that we should
stop giving aid to countries in need.
But that we to ensure that that aid
is used to nourish a people rather
than disposses them. 4

With this in mind, here are a
few more facts to think about
compliments of the Harper’s In-
dex in the December 1991 issue:

1. Acres of land on the West
Bank seized by the Israeli govern-
ment since the peace process be-
gan last March: 46,000.

2. Chances that an Israeli
“would consider trading territories
for peace”: 2 in 3. ‘

3. Percentage’of annual U.S
economic aid to Israel that is used
to pay debts to the United States:
99.

4. Number of the 6 Démo--
cratic presidential candidates who
say they support unconditional loan
guarantees for Israel: 5. ° (The
intention here is not to denounce’
the Democrats, but to question their”
foreign policy agenda’ which is
clearly détermined”by the cam-
paign contributions of the Pro-Is-

’ raeli political action committees.
