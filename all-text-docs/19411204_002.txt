New Telephone System
Definitely Needed

It has been called to our attention
that nothing has been done in the way
of improving the poor telephone system
that exists at Davidson. In this edi-
torial we follow up the suggestion which
appeared two weeks ago in a letter to
the editor,

If you don’t believe there is a reason
for improving the telephone set-up on
the campus, just try calling Georgia
dormitory from Charlotte some after-
noon, — At first you hear the patient
ringing of an ordinary telephone call
--- later you hear louder and longer
ringings with still no answer---finally a
continuous buzzing that bears an inten-
tion of cither making someone answer
or driving them crazy in the attempt.
“Hello,” finally comes answer that
sounds like it is an infringement. on the
hallowed grounds for telephones to even
exist.

“Could I speak with Donald Doe?”
the caller asks in a pleading, but more
than polite tone.

“Sorry as I can be, but he rooms in
East.” And you're lucky if you get
that-much information, ~

And the ring ceremony is repeated.
“Yes, that’s his name D-O-N-A-L-D
Doe, D-O-E.”

“Oh, Donald Doe---never heard of
him.”

“Hello, Operator, were cut off?”

“No, the receiver is still down, but I
think somebody just turned over the
telephone booth. I’ve never heard such
a racket.”

“Hello, Hello, Hello. Were we cut
off? No, just a bunch of boys came
down the steps sellifig concert tickets.
It’s all right. Here’s Donald now. He
was a freshmen you see, the reason I'd
never heard of him. New here and
everything.”

“Yes, yes---Is that you Donald ?.Wait
a minute; let me get on aspirin.”

Seriosuly, now let’s do away with all
this horseplay over. the telephones. A
central telephone system with an N. Y,
A. job paying students to operate it and

| telephones on all the floors of the dormi-
tories would eliminate a lot of wasted
time and effort.

If a telephone rang on your Hall, you
would -have-more*reason to answer it
promptly and too, there would be more

-, chance of -your-knowing something of
the whereabouts of persons wanted who
are not in their rooms,

These stock answers of, “He may be
in the library studying” or “I think he
went to the late show” are about as in-
formative as Peter Rabbit. This edi-
torial not only advocates more sensible
information over the phones, but. also
a new system with a central outlet so
persons can be immediately located for
the caller and the job of finding them can
be left up te a student rather than a tele-
phone einployee.

\ criticism in recent years to The David-
sonian has been that no one ever knows
what managing editor’ does what. Each
managing editor is responsible for the
make-up and the copy-reading of a page
cach week, with the exception of one who
acts as assignment editor.

from now on we will print.on the edi-
torial page the names of the managing’
editors and the page for which they are
responsible. Of course the editor-in-chief
is responsible for the entire contents of
the paper._Covering the news is the job
of the assignment editor.

tors, the sports editor is responsible for

The Staff Letters to the Editor

An Open

Dear Tony: 2

Faced with four classes in the
morning, I can’t settle down to
studying until I have given voice
to my ideas on the Queens-David-
son “controversey.”

Perhaps I ‘dm prejudiced, but I
have met a good many students of
our sister college, and I want to
say that Bill Lyman’s attack on the
institution was uncalled for and on
the whole a gross exaggeration.
Such outbursts may sometimes be
justified if well done. In my opin-
ion his attack was neither justified
nor well done. ;

For four years I have watched
what I (evidently mistakenly)
thought was an improving attitude
between otir schools.’ I admit we
have not doné all we might to help
the situation but I have seen an
increasing number of D. C. boys
in Queens date parlors and on her
“well-adapted” campus—at night. I
have watched our musical organi-
zations work together in a fine way

We did pull a beeach of etiquette
a\year or two ago when we failed
to return Queens’ gracious invita-
tion. We owe a real apology for
said conduct. However, the men-
tion of it in a recent issue of Quéens
Blues was anything but a_ step
toward better relations. Their ref-
erence to the air base and Ft.
Jackson (to say nothing of the
naive or frustated miss who hadn't
heard of Davidson) were hardly
efforts toward a better co-operation
between D. C. and Q. C.

Let's kiss and make-up! Why
should Queens take Lyman’s opinion
as that of the average Davidson’s
student? I hope we can assume
that the students quoted in the
Blues did not voice the feeljng of
the average Queens student.

Sam reached out. and Al was gone
with the draft. His exploits in

the section of the film which deals

Ronald Colman, Anna Lee, Charles
Winninger, Reginald Gardiner, and
Gilbert Roland.

Although this picture is a light
and amusing comedy in places, it’s
plot is rather weak. The cast is
excellent, but the story is spread
a little too thin. Anna Lee, in her
American debut, plays the fluttery,
attractive wife of Ronald Colman,
who is continuously falling for var-
ious men.
Patient husband, and the support-
ing cast, headed by Charles Win-
ninger, is fine.

I would like for Frank Lee to be
the guest of the theatre for any
feature this week.

The New York Story

Most of us here at Davidson
have had the opportunity at some
time to visit that boiling pot of
America, that seething, strangely
harmonious-mass of-humanity, steel,
stone, and neon that is New York—
wonder city of modern times. This
New York story will not be some-
thing new to
them, but to
those unfortu-
nates who have
not smelled the
Fulton Fish
Market, gaped
at the sings on
Times Square,
or crashed
through the
bowels of Man-
express sub-
Way -train, it will be just another
of the multitude of pieces they
have read about the wonder city
and wondered if it were true.

Rudolph
hattan on an I. R, T.

The -first-indication of the ma-
chine-like nature of the metropolis
is received by the motorist when
he approaches the contract bridge
belt of suburban New Jersey. It is
here that _he feels the tentacles of
Manhattan reaching out to grab its
worshippers. It is here that one
begins to feel as if he were a cog
in some great conyeyor belt. Cars
speeding through the dusk on great
super highways soon head over the
great Pulaski Skyway which spans
the outskirts of Newark and Joisey
City. Then you will see ramps to
the right of you, Tramps to the left
of you; and you will feel like that
Jewish rabbi in Maxwell Ander-
son's “Winterset,” who “knew not
what the fires mean to right or
left on this dark star.” But you
keep on—driven by the throngs—
and arrive at the Holland Tunnel, to
me one of the great wonders of the
world. While craft of all descrip-
tion plow through the Hudson River,
you are unconcernedly sitting in
an automobile, several fathoms be-
low, watching the white and yel-
low -tile walls whisk by—finally to

the Hudson and East rivers), on
the east by the East River, and on
the west by the Hudson River, may
he divided somehow into five re-
gions: the bustling financial dis-
trict that is commonly known as
“Down-town;” the great. territory
between “Down-town” and “Mid-
town” including Greenwich Village,
and the little merchants and inn-
keepers; “Mid-town,” which in-
cludes the “Gay White Way,” the
finer hotels and stores; the Cen-
tral Park region, stretching from
60th Street to 110th Street, a per-
fect maze of tree-framed apart-
ment house views; and finally, Har-
lem, with its ordors of cheap pow-
der and hair-straightener permeat-
ing the already quite dark atmos-
phere. Then, of course, you have
four other boroughs besides Man-
hattan-to contend with: Brooklyn
(home of “Dem Bums”), the Bronx
(a rabbi’s paradise), Queens (the
middle-class residential havea, and
Richmond (nothing but Staten
Island).

New York has probably been the
subject or’ background of more
Poems, songs, movies, and_ fiction
than any other place in the U. S.,
and rightly-so: -Where else would
you find two million Jews, and
innumerable other races and_na-

concentrated mob of people in the
