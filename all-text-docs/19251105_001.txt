Wildkitten Gal lea Shakes fi and
Wins From Duke University Yearlings

Kell and Black Star Star as Davidson
Fresh Defeat Duke Freshmen

The Davidson Witldkittens, cringing under
the knowledge of two defeats so far this
season and wins, went into the Duke
Freshman game last Friday, somewhat re-
juvenated despite the absence of a number of
regulars, and defeated the heavy Duke Fresh-
man team, 9 to 7, in a clash which can well
be described by the term hectic.

First the Wildkittens led, then the Duke
yearlings had the upper hand, and finally the
Wilcats won. Both teams were passing at
will, and the uncertainty of this policy kept
the few spectators who watched the game
in a somewhat expectant attitude.

The first scoring came in the initial period
after the Duke Freshmen had fumbled on
their own 34-yard line. In two first downs
the Freshmen placed the ball on Duke's five-
yard line, but after three attempts fo. only
two yards, James kicked a field goal from
placement, giving the Wildcats first points.

The little Blue Devils received a kick on

their own 45-yard line in the second quarter,
and in three successive passes went across
_for a touchdown, the last pass being com-
pleted for 28 yards, Godfrey taking it across.
McNinch kicked extra point, which then gave
Duke the lead. Previous to this touchdown
they had attempted a field goal from place-
ment.

In the third quarter neither team scored,
but when the quarter ended Davidson had
the ball on Duke's six-inch’ line.
