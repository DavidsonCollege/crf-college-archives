Paper in the South.

Society on the evening of April 8th dis-
played much oratory and heat but very
few real arguments, as was brought out
in the reviewer's speech. Jenkins, Or:
gain, J. P. Williams and Mullen upheld
the affirmative of the subject: ‘‘Resalv-
ed, That Germany is justified in using
her methods of warfare.” Their chief
argument seemed to be that as Gerniany
was hottled up on all sides and . was
fighting for her very life, she was justi-
fied in using any means to preserve her
existence. The negative was upheld by
Honeycutt, Potts, W. J. Morrison and
W. A. Johnson, who argued that Ger-
many is breaking the Hague treaty by
her actions, and cited many incidents of
Germany's cruelty. As the reviewer
said, only two arguments were hacked
up with proof, one by Potts and the
other by Mullen, and added that not
enough preparation had been given to
the dehate. The decision of the judges
was in favor of the negative.

In the meeting Mondav morning, F.
M. Mitchell and W. G. Morrison gave
orations, and C. B. Robson and E, A.
Woods gave declamations. The speeches
were good.

On Monday morning, April 17th, the
election of the last term officers will be
held in the Eumenean Socicty. Also the
new Magazine staff and the debating
council will be elected. All members
are urged to be presnt.

The first meeting in the Phi Society
far two wecks was held Saturday night.
The walls have received a fresh coat of
“flat coat.” which has greatly improved
the appearance of the hall. The meet-
ing was well attended and the dehate
was interesting. The query read: “Re-
solved, That Germany is justifiable in
her methods of warfare.” The affirma-
tive was upheld by C. W. Worth, Stone,
Cumming, Murray and Knox. Their
chief arguments were that Germany is
in a life and death struggle, and that the
atrocities of the soldiers are incidents not
methods of warfare. The negative was

son, D. Monroe, Nisbet and Reese.
They: argued that Germany had gone
back to the middle ages in her methods
of warfare. Vhey proved that the air
craft raids and submarine warfare were
atrocities and were Germany's methods
of warfare.  Altho the debate was
goad on both sides, the judges rendered
their decision in favor of the negative.

Monday morning declamations were
given by Currie and Faires. McIntire
gave a talk on Thomas Mote Osborn,
warden of Sing Sing. Carson talked
upon “Phe Significance of Villa’s Raid.”

D. Monroe upon “Steps ‘Voward Inter-
national Peace.” D. 1. McKeithen made
the last speech of the meeting, his subject
being “The Submarine.”

In each of the literary societies Mon.
dav morning there was presented a plan
for the improvement of the Davidson
College Magazine. ‘Vhe commnittee, aft-
er a consultation with Dr. Fulton, re-
ported the plan as follows: “The staff

shall consist of six members, the editor

in-chief with two assistants, and the busi-
ness manager with two assistants, instead
of twelve members as at present. “Phe
editor-in-chief will continue to be elected
alternately from the two societies, ‘Vhis
proposed change has necessitaed a change
in the constitution of the societies. — It
was passed in the Eumenean Society, but
according to the constitution of the Phil
anthropic it has to lie on the table for
two weeks. ‘The members of the staff
will be clected at the next clection in the
societies:
