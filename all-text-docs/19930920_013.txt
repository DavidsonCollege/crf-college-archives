Artist Series welcomes internationally acclaimed performers

By Jacob Abraham

Beginning this fall, members
of the Davidson community will
have a chance to enjoy the talents
of a host of world-class artists,
musicians, and performers, live on
stage. No, it’s nota trip to Broad-
way, or Washington, or even Char-
lotte; it’s the Davidson Artists Se-
ries. Four distinctive performances
in the Love Auditorium promise to
provide some outstanding enter-
tainment for everyone, while show-
casing some extraordinary talent.

On September 29th, the Art-
ists Series kicks off with the Broad-
way musical “Sunday in the Park
with George.” Stephen Sondheim
contributes music and lyrics to
James Lapine’s unconventional
story about how a work of art af-
fects both the artist and his audi-
ence. The show revolves around

George Seurat’s famous pointillist
creation, “A Sunday Afternoon on
the Island of La Grande Jatte.”
While the first half of the musical
delves into the life of Seurat him-
self during his workon “La Grande
Jatte,” the second half jumps into
the twentieth century to examine
the creation of a modern tribute to
Seurat’s work. The story begins
with Seurat, whose obsession with
his art has destructive conse-
quences for his personal relation-
ships.

In the second act, however,
the focus shifts to Seurat’s distant
grandson, also named George, who
manipulates technology to artistic
ends while making deals to build
his success. Sondheim and Lapine
reexamine perceptions of art,
whether neo-Impressionism or the
modern musical, while providing

the audience with a show the New
York Times called “audacious,
haunting, and touching.”

The Artists Series then turns
to a different sort of performance,
as internationally acclaimed pia-
nist Robert Taub comes to
Davidson on Novembertwentieth.
Taub is at the forefront of a new
generation of piano virtuosos, and
his listofaccomplishmentsis seem-
ingly endless. A Princeton gradu-
ate, he was presented the highest
award in piano from the Julliard
School, where he later taught. He
has performed everywhere from
New York to Los Angeles, from
Berlin to Hong Kong; he has played
with the Montreal Symphony Or-
chestra, the Philadelphia Orches-

tra, the BBC Philharmonic, and.

the San Francisco Symphony; he
has appeared at major music festi-
vals across the globe. His musical
repertoire runs from the Baroque
to modern, and he has premiered
music from various contemporary
composers, particularly American
composer Milton Babbitt. Taub
will bring his own interpretation of
Babbitt’s work to Davidson, where
the composer himself will be
among the audience members.

Further adding to the diver-
sity of the Artists Series is the
Urban Bush Women, a varied
group of performers who will come
to Davidson on March 8th. While
all of the talents of the Urban Bush
Women fall in the realm of theater,
their performances encompass
skills ranging from dance to a
capella singing to mime and spo-
ken word. Their purpose remains
to pay tribute to their African heri-
tage and religious traditions, but
the overwhelming theme of their
energetic performances is an affir-
mation of the various dimensions
of the human spirit — pushing the
boundaries of conventional stereo-
types of race, sex, and the body.
The Urban Bush Women have
taken their act across the U. S. and
into Europe, garnering critical ac-
claim through their shows while
encouraging cross-cultural com-
munication through workshops and
residencies.

Finally, closing the 1993-94
Artists Series with a bash, the
Broadway musical “Cabaret”
comes to Davidson. Set in Berlin
in the early 1930s, “Cabaret” cap-
tures the spirit of Germany just
prior to the rise of the Third Reich.

But rather than focusing on the
gloom and embitterment of the
period, the musical instead high-
lights the frivolity and frenzied
merriment with which the people
of Berlin reacted to the increas-
ingly tense atmosphere. Set in the
riotous Kit Kat Club, the show
revolves around the relationship
between Sally, who sings in the
nightclub, and her American lover
who wants to whisk her away to
the safety of the States. Light-
hearted and fun, “Cabaret” includes —
fifteen brilliant songs by Kander
and Ebb. At its opening in New
York, the multi-award winning
show was named Best Musical of
the Year. Life Magazine called it
“one of the best musicals in Broad-
way history.”

Clearly, the Artists Series
should have something of interest
even for those who do not follow
theater or consider themselves pa-
trons of the arts. Why run all the
way to the city when some of the
finest artists in the world will soon
be right on campus? The diversity
and skillfuiness of each of the per-
formances is sure to liven up the
arts at Davidson in the fall and

spring.

Country sticks with its drinking roots

Dixie continued from page 11

a love that went wrong...”
Willie Nelson’s “Whiskey

’ River” takes advantage of another

common theme in Country music:
Drinkin’ someone off your mind.
The subject matter, however, isn’t

what carries this song. It’s his
informal style that makes itso pow-
erful. One long harmonica and
guitar jam runs through the whole
thing.

I’d kill to watch these boys
play on a back porch in Kentucky
somewhere. It’s pure country.

“Friends in Low Places,” as
everyone knows, is one of Garth
Brooks biggest hits. It didn’t, how-
ever, reach the top of the charts
because of the musical ability of
the band. This song’s success lies
in it’s subject matter: Hating the
woman who left.you for some rich
dude and gettin’ drunk. In Country
music especially, the rich guy all
too often gets the girl.

If you watched The Muppet
Show, you'll probably remember
Kenny Rogers andthe little redneck
muppet with the mustache singing
“The Gambler.”

I think I cried when his little
muppet spirit went up to muppet
Heaven. The song, like much of
Country, is about life. “You got to
know when to hold ‘em, know
when to fold ‘em,” and know when
to pass the bottle.

The last song Ill mention is
an old George Jones tune. “Ten-
nessee Whiskey” reminds us all
that some things are better than
gettin’ drunk.

Awoman’s love is as “smooth
as Tennessee whiskey, as sweet as
strawberry wine.” As the Georgia
boy Alan Jackson would say,
George “don’t need the booze to
get a buzz on.”

Listen to these five songs. If
you don’t like any of them, I don’t
know what to tell you. If you do
like them (and you probably will)
I’m glad I could help you out.
When you go back home to New
Jersey, or wherever, play these five
for your friends.

Have them do the same for
their friends, and so on. Come on,
people, lets do our part to make
this world a better place for every-
one.
