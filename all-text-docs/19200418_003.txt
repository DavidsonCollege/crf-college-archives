THE DAVIDSONIAN, April 8, 1920.

MR. JACKSON LEADS EASTER

SERVICE OF Y. M. C. A.

Highly Practical Talk Given by Col-
lege Treasurer. of Chris-
tianity’s Relation to Accounting.

Mr. Jackson, who has for the last
two years been teaching the course
in Accounting, spoke to the- Y. M.
C. A. on the subject “Christianity
Related to Accounting.” The Bible
verse which expressed his main
thought was, “Be not slothful in
business, fervent in spirit, serving
the Lord.”

The first thought brought out
was that Jesus is our Capital Stock.
If our income is to increase, our as-
sets must be greater than our liabil-
ities, What are some of the assets
in the Christian life? First, there
is Christian influence. We are as
subject to influence of those about
us as the young plants are to the
sunshine and raig. So be sure that
your influence will be for good and
not for evil. Our lives are contin-
ually changing and are open to sug-
gestion and it is easy for sin to
creep in. Therefore, it is necessary
that we choose good companions as
we would choose a good man if go-
ing into business. Secondly, every
life has some great controlling fac-
tor. Every one has something to do
in this world and we should go to
God and seek His guidance for this.
The last asset is belief in prayer.

rayer is one of the greatest things
in the Christian life, for it is practi-
cally the same as drawing a check
on Christ, who is able to pay the
whole debt. All prayers are an-
swered to him ‘that believeth,
though not always in the affirm-
ative. “The effectual, fervent pray-
er ef a righteous man availeth
much.”

Then some of the liabilities in the
Christian life are: First, Indiffer-

At Next “Y” Meeting—Governor
Bickett to be Speaker of Evening.

The “Y” meeting next Sunday ;the campus enthusiasts is centered

evening is expected to be the best
of the whole year. Governor Bick-
ett will be here to address the stu-
dents and will doubtless yive one of
the most practicaly and inspiring
talks that has been heard on the
campus in quite a while. He is noted
not only in this state, but through-
out the whole country as a man of
sterling character and as a speaker
of no mean ability. There will be
| speciat music by the quartet and or-
chestra, so this is a meeting that no
one can afford to miss, and a 100
per cent attendance is expected. All
the townspeople are cordially invit-
‘ed to meet with the students and
it is hoped that many of them will
attend.

'VISIT OF MR. PARKER, OUR
MISSIONARY TO KOREA
BRINGS GREAT PLEASURE

' Mr. W. P. Parker, *11, spent four
days on the hill, from Saturday until
Wednesday of last week, visiting
among the students and_ telling
them of his work in Korea. This is
the first opportunity the students
have had to hear directly from their
own, representative in the foreign
mission field, as he has just return-
ed from his work on his first fur-
lough.

| Mr. Parker gave three talks Sun-

iday, one at the Sunday School in

;the afternoon to the town people,

lone at the “Y” service to the stu-
dent body, and another at the meet-

ting of the Student Volunteers just
after church.

CAMPUSSISMS.

There is a slight epidemic of
mumps in college. Last week Rich-
ards, W. J., Covington, Gamble and
Johnson, V. D., “went over” with it.

Freddie, the little son of Prof.
Macon Reed, is ill in a Charlotte
hospital. He was operated on Fri-
day for mastoditis and is getting
along as well as could be expected.
His mother is with him.

Dr. Martin will leave this week
for Pass Christian, Miss. It will be
remembered that Dr. and Mrs, Mar-
tin spent several weeks there carly
in the year; Mrs. Martin was so
pleased with the locality that she
decided to remain a while after Dr.
Martin found it necessary to return
to the Hill. Mrs. Martin expects to
return with him about the middie of
this week.

| Dr. Richards left Thursday for
| Greensboro to attend a_ special
meeting of one of the Synodical
jcommittees of which he is a mem-

ber.

Lack of space forbids the mention
of all the men who left the Hill to
spend Easter elsewhere—would be
easier to give a list of those who re-
mained.

great many think more of their
reputation than of their character.
If they can keep the people fooled,
they don’t think of God. The last
liability is the habit of sin.
course all people sin, but we should
strive to keep God’s command-
ments.

The last thought brought out by
Mr. Jackson was, be sure that your
assets outweigh your liabilities. If
we have love, peace, joy, longsuf-
fering and faith, we can be sure that
our assets outweigh the liabilities.

MINISTERIAL BAND

ENJOYS LECTURE
By Dr. Richards on “The History of

the Presbyterian Church.”

On Sunday afternoon before a
joint meeting of the Ministerial and
Volunteer Bands, Dr. Richards.made
a very interesting and timely talk.
Despite the bad weather and the
fact that a large number of men are
home spending Easter, one of the
biggest and most enthusiastic meet-
ings held this year heard Dr. Rich-
ards. It was noted that very few
of the men who became candidates
recently for the Home and Foreign
Fields were present. Come on, fel-
lows, fall in and get the right spirit.
The Band welcomes all students to
its meetings.

The subject of Dr. Richards’ talk
was “The History of the Presbyte-
rian Church.” The address was very
interesting and owing to the fact
that most people know very little
about Church History. Also at the

resent time, when so much is be-
ing done to bring together the two
branches of the Presbyterian
Church, it was most timely and in-
structive from that point of view.
None of us can afford to miss such
meetings as those held the past
weeks.

| INTERCOLLEGIATE

CONFERS WITH “Y” CABINET

Mr. Hall Watson, Traveling In-
(dustrial Secretary of the Y. M.
_A., was on the hill last Friday. At

y the cabinet meeting on Friday after-

noon Mr. Watson made suggestions
for the work of the “Y” on the
campus next year. He is very de-
/sirous that the “Y"” be made more
of a center for the social life of the
‘students and suggested plans for
carrying this into effect.

: As Mr. Watson is very much in-
terested in social work, he discussed

methods for carrying on the work:

in the mission Sunday Schools in a
more effective way. His talk was
jvery much enjoyed and it will show
results in the work of the Y. M. C.
| A. for next year.

DEBATERS SELECTED

the debate with the best speech of
the evening, in which he brought
out a great many forceful and well
organized arguments. His rebuttal
was also strong.

The honors were equally divided
between the two societies, as each
got two speakers and an alternate.
(Schenck and Liston were alter-
nates). An interesting feature of
the occasion ‘was the large number
of aspiring Fresh-Soph debaters
present. The Fresh-Soph contest
used the same subject, and it is ru-
mored that much of the same ma-
terial was used, verbatim.

The first debate will be with
