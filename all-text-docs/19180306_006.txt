JUNIOR ORATORICAL

(Continued from page ‘)

for awarding the Ds to those men who
won basketball letters this spring. Dr.
Harding awarded the letters, making
many humorous comments that rendered
the occasion quite enjoyable.

‘Those receiving letters were: Henge-
veld, “D” and three stars; (Captain)
King, “D” and two. stars; Flowers,
“D"; J. W. McAlister, “D”, and L. C.
McCaskill, “D”, and Angle, Manager’s
“D”". The following men received
“D Cs”: T. R. Alexander, W. M.
Hall, Romefelt, Schenck and H. W.
Davenport.

This war has brought on a good many
things, and not the least of these is the
gentle art of camouflage. We have al-
ready been told something about this by
our obliging Juniors, but it remained for
others to put the gentle art in practice.
There was a conspicuous addition to the
Fair Sex at the Concert and Reception,
due to the apt employment of the art of
camouflage. Camouflage has long been
recognized as one of the chief means of
power among the female sex, and one in
which they have all obtained high pro-
ficiency. But it remained tor a staid
Ministerial Candidate and others to
widen the art in its application to in-
clude specimens of masculinity. They
succeeded perfectly. Three young gen-
‘tlement whose mothers had confidently
looked forward to the day when they
would be President were suddenly trans-
formed into one of that class of beings
who, because they have to be assisted
down the street, and into theaters and
out of automobiles, have earned the title
of the weaker sex. In the twinkling of
an eye thev became as good a member of
the said class as if they had spent their
whole life on friendly terms with Resinal
Soap and Pompeian Vanishing Cream.
They possessed one of those “Skins You
Love to Touch.”

Their motto
Words.”
have been shocked by their conduct, and
several ladies believed that it was just

“Deeds, Not

was

awful to carry on like that in public.
But as for me and my house here’s three
good hearty cheers for the Camouflage
Company, Limited. Rah! Rah! Rah!
FACULTY RECEPTION.

One of the most attractive features of
Junior Speaking was the reception given
on Saturday evening by the members of
the Faculty in honor of the Junior class,
who had as their guests the Senior class,

the Orchestra and Glee Club, and their

friends.

Immediately following the concert in
Shearer hall the guests proceeded to the
new gymnasium building where they
were received by the members of the
Faculty and their wives. A most notice-
able feature of the occasion was the first
display of the college service flag con-
taining 340 stars, which hung from the
beams overhead in the center of the
room. At both ends of the spacious hall.
punch and cake was served by the Misses
Vinson, Steele, Baskerville and Grey.
‘The reception was attended by one of
the largest crowds ever present at. an
oratorical reception at Davidson.
erwards the fraternity halls were open
to visitors.
