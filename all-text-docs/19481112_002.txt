Probably GVeRy friend®of Davidson who
lives in North or South Carolina has heard
of the Convocation Cornerstone and the cam-
paign that was launched last Saturday. They
know that Davidson has need of money for
expansion and they are thinking now in
terms of wliat Davidson is and how Much she

merits support.

Just exactly how the people of North Caro-
lina, other than alumni, look at Davidson has
been brought out by editorials in many news-
papers throughout the State, since the recent
publicity concerning the ¢ ‘onvocation. Typical
of the drift of their feelings is the follow-
ing paragraph from an editorial in Winston-
Salem’s Twin City Sentinel of November 4.
‘Davidson College is to North Carolinians
the little institution that produces great and
* good men. Even to those whose first alle-
giance is to another college or university
Davidson has-a-unique hold on the imagina-
tion. Perhaps it is because of the men it has
educated and sent‘dut into the world. A
Davidson man is usually called ‘‘a fine fel-
low” and he’s a smart one. The Davidson
spirit is well known. The Davidson football
teams will fight better teams to a standstill.”
Another fine tribute to Davidson from the
editorial page of the Charlotte Observer of
November 10:
Davidson College is one of North Caro-
lina’s, the South’s, the nation’s greatest as-
sets. It does many things. But the greatest

thing it does is train young men, face them

the Galilean. If the world is to survive, it
must shortly tearn that there is no other way
save the path so long ago pointed out by
Jesus of Nazareth, a path never vet walked
by the nations, a path hardly investigated.

That is Davidson’ contribution through
her century of illustrious service. That is her
promise for the days to come. That has been

of Davidson College — to emphasize and

Davidson has been doing this consistently
and enthusiastically and with such suecess
that her graduates have become her’ most
resplendent monument. Now Davidson comes
to her alumni, her church, her friends ‘within
and without the Presbyterian denomination,
the of her community —
which has stretched out to wider and wider
limits of usefulness and service—and asks
merely that the necessary funds be provided
to assure her continued work at this same
tremendous and glorious task, the building
of the only really. important product, the
youth ‘of the land. Let Davidson—and the
other great institutions like her throughout

* Homecoming has come and gone. The
cornerstone has been laid, the convoeation
has been eonvocated and uneonvocated and
all with considerable success. The college

whole affair was carried off well, indeed,

game was played.

Also to be congratulated on their extra
dose of Davidson spirit are the boys ‘who,
iwith their dates, set out the game in the rain

goodly number of students, but also many
of the alumni set through two hours of
drenching rain to cheer the Wildeats on.

While we are handing out commendations,
let us not forget to voice a word of ‘disap-
pointment in the direction of those few pro-

By JIMMY HENRITZY

When asked what in the world
had gone wrong with the polls, Mr,
Roper replied, “Well, first of all,
we simply don't know.’ For Mr.
Roper at that moment, under the
terrific strain of one of the most
baffling campaigns in history, the
answer quite true, Sut
emerging from the mystery of just
why Mr. Truman was re-elected is
a number of very good reasons to
explain the result which shocked
the nation into a dazed of
acceptance early Wednesday. Here
are some of them. First of all, the
heavy farm vote, heretofore always
in the GOP bag, didn’t give the ex-
pected support to Dewey because
they were, to a large degree, satis-
fied with things as they are; the
farmer has never fared better than
now. The American people have
always had a feeling for the under-
dog and Truman's every action con-
vinced many people that here was
a man set upon, harried, and un-
justly, castigated, For this reason
many people voted for him out of
sympathy. The labor campaign for
‘Truman was unspectacular but im-
mensely effective. In many states
Truman rode in on the coattails of
highly popular local talent. There
was undoubtedly a protest vote
against the 80th Congress which,
admittedly, didn't slo as well as
it should or could have dones The
vote for Wallace, expected to be
indirectly a vote for Dewey, was
far lower thén expected, Arid final-
ly, the age-old techniques of propa-
ganda employed by Mr, Truman

{none of its irresistible momentum
in spite of the puerile machinations
of a blundering president whose
guiding, principle has seemed to be,
“I must? do something dramatic.’
And notable absent from the
reasons for this upset is even the
slightest hint that Truman was or
is a capable, intelligent, or judicious
man, in short, the best man run-
ning for the job.

The Democrats are once more in
full and complete control. No longet
can they point to any aspect of Re-
publican action as the cause for our
ills and troubles. The Republicans,
by losing, have been automatically
exonerated from future blame. The
responsibility is now squarely at
the feet of the Democrats under
Truman. We feel that an ironic mis-
take has been made, but, to quote
Dewey, we must “unite” behind
the man who beat him and behind
“every effort to keep our nation
strong and free and establish peace
in the world.” If we do otherwise,
Truman cannot succeed—he has
shown that only too clearly by his
past actions. Thus, we can do no
better than put into action the
‘theme of the high-minded, clean
campaign of Governor Dewey—
unity for a strong nation and for
peace. These “were no idle words
with Dewey and if the Republicans
are to justify their leaders sincerity,
they must practice it in the next
four years, We must sweep aside
all petty political motives. This na-
tion has never been, in a ° more
