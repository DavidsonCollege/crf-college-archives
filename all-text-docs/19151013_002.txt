EDITORIAL.

A WEEK OF SELF-EXAMINATION.

One of the greatest religious needs of
Davidson College is not that the college
directory shall be found, name by name,
on the church rolls throughout — the
South, though this is a goal to be reach-
ed, if it is at all possible. With very
few exceptions, every man is technically
a member of some church and a great
ery would be raised if the claim should
be made that the college was not a
Christian institution.

In perfect frankness, we niust say
that. church membership among a large
number of the men on the campus docs
not carry with it the duties and respon-
sibilities which should’ be a requisite of
church connection, A great number are
seemingly members simply because it is
considered the “proper” thing: and be-
cause parents made it understood that
church membership was expected.

And without minimizing the impart
ance and value of church membership
for everyone, vet from one point of or
ganization and-eflicieney in the work of
the church. we do sav that it would be
far better if those who are not willing te
properly wear the badee of Christianity,
should step aside and allow the work to
go ahead without their dead weight or
possibly their active negative influence.
Nothing is so discouraging as a great
body of drones who only block progress
and efficiency.

From the standpoint of the: individ-
ual, this passive indifference is an atti:
tude which, if cultivated, will be a men-
ace- throughout life.

A rare opportunity is offered. to every
man on the campus to show his calors
during this week. Davidson is extreme-
Iv fortunate in being able to secure Dr.
Chapman and his valuable co-workers.
who will bring a message which will
undoubtedly burn deep into our very
lives and compel a close self-examina-
tion, What will be the result of this
examination? Will we be willing to go
on with a “passive indifference” or ex-
erting a “negative influence.” or will we
show our true colors and offer ourselves
for that service which may come to hand
and determine to make our lives more
nearly what they should be?

“Todav” is a period of great events,
and small things have no place in our
lives. Nations are changing over night
and Christianity is being tested as never
before. Thinking heathen nations,
without realizing that Christianity is a
matter of personal decision and not na-
tional belief, are questioning why it is

sossible for so-called “Christian” na-
tions to engage in such a war as is now
‘n progress. Every student should
show his right to be called « “man” by
tanding squarely for the best and by be-
ing of service in the work to be done,
hus making it clearly evident that he is
a member of the organized church.

A spirit of loyalty to those who have
come to Davidson with this message, of
co-operation with those who are caring
for the details of the meetings and of
thorough — self-examination, with — the
hought of truly living by those stand-
ards which each church member has
promised to follow—these things should
characterize this most important week
in the religious life of the college.
