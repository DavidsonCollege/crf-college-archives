__year the objective ‘has been set at $1,000,

But the purpose which the “Y” hopes to ac-
complish is larger also.

An average contribution of $1.55'will meet
the amount which has been asked. And this
sum can be afforded by nearly every man on
the campus. When we realize the money we
spend monthly on useless things, a dollar or
two given to such a cause seems too little.
And it is. That is why the YMCA should
have no trouble at all in raising the money.
But it will. And the reason will be that a
great many will procrastinate—“I’ll have it

Benny Goodman's new band is
finally taking form. The King of

past It years has held down a chair

din Duke Ellington's brass ‘section.
Harry Jaeger replaces Dave Tough
as drummer with the unit. Carley
Christians, guitarist; Sam Dona-
huc, white tenor man. and
Bernstein on bass are others deh-
‘nitely set. The band wilt andoubt-

edly be doing some recording dates

for Columbia in the near future.

Will Bradley—Cotumbia 35707—
"Watk Me Down the Koad a Piece,”
“Celery Stalks at) Midnight.” Co-

Each of these records represents
typical Bradley mitsic. “Make You
Care" and “Once in a Love Time”
showing: off. the band’s sweet dance
music, and “Down the Road” and
“Celery Stalks” illustrating — the
“hoogie woogie” variety which has
recently become so popular. From

The Four Monitors
Sitting in the balcony at church one ob-
‘serves OMe very Interesling thing. There are
four monitors who check the roll Urelessiy
during the early part of .vespers, and eagie
cyes watch for late arrivals downstairs.
That is their yob and they do st well.;

But as we were brought up to know
church, and as we have observed chucch .
services for a good many years, monitors
have no part in it. Never before (or since,
we suppbsé) have we seen anything to com-
pare with four men paid to check on just
who is present at a service dedicated to the
worship of our God.

Of course we have been overt the reasons
for this time and again, and they seem good,
when looked at from one viewpoint. But
there is another viewpoint to be considered
also. However, this is not the time for a
discussion of that. 1

But those four monitors look -very-much
out of place at vespers! *
