Dear Sir:

In your issue of April 14th, the following limerick is
attributed to Herb Jackson:

"To tempt me toward limericks is mean
for I find my mind in-between
Obscene is uncouth
but truth remains truth
I know less than one that is clean."

In case Herb would like to add a limerick to his repertoire
which is clean, I contribute tne following, which was told
to me by my mother some fifty years ago.

"There was a young man from Japan
whose poetry no one could scan
When told this was so
He said, 'Yes, I know,
But I always try to get just as many words
in the last line as I possibly can.'"'

Sincerely,

Waiter L. Lingle, Jr.
WLL: eh

David Litaker. .
