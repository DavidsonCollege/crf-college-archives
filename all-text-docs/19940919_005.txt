Lunar Luau to fall
during Homecoming

By Beth Bacon

Traditionally, Lunar Luau pro-
vides freshmen’ s first introduction
to Patterson Court houses through
the booths each fraternity and eat-
ing house displays there. This year,
however, the Union-sponsored
event takes place the weekend fol-
lowing first night down, after fresh-
men already will have been ex-
posed to the court. Lunar Luau is
set for Friday, September 23, from
8 p.m. to 11 p.m.

David Rozelle, social chair of

SAE, says, “It’s unfortunate that —

Lunar Luau fell on Homecoming
weekend this year because it
doesn’t allow freshmen to get an
unbiased look at Patterson Court
before they’ re able tocome down.”
Because Lunar Luau will be
during Homecoming weekend,
there is the fear that the houses
won’t have enough time to put
together quality booths. To rem-
edy this problem, several of the
houses plan to join together with
one another in order to present
themselves to freshmen.
“Patterson Court looks for-
ward to working together to present
itself as Patterson Court, at the

Freshmen
welcomed
to Patterson
Court last
Friday

By Susan Warren

On Friday, freshman were
welcomed onto court with a num-
ber of parties.

The afternoon began with a
revival of the 3:01 Club. Both
Rusk and SAE had Friday After-
noon Clubs, with SAE sponsoring
a reggae band. Freshman. were
well represented on the court,
mostly coming down in large
groups from their halls.

Friday night consisted of a
band party at PiKA, a country
music band at Kappa Sig, a video-
DJ party at Phi Delt, and parties at
KA and Sig Ep.

Freshman were excited to be
down on the court after two weeks
of waiting. All freshmen had meet-
ings with their hall counselors ear-
lier in the week concerning first
night down.’ Hall counselors were
“on duty” throughout the evening,
with one hall counselor on each
hall and one on the court.

One freshman girl said about
the evening: “I had an awesome
time, I was sober [due to soccer] so
I now know in any kind of condi-
tion I can have.a good time.” __..

This was the freshman’s “first”
social interaction with upperclass-
men on campus. Most freshmen
were pleased with the “laid-back”
atmosphere of the court and are
excited about the rest of their first
year at Davidson.

same time showing each individual
house,” Rozelle says.

The date was chosen because
historically, Lunar Luau is
preceeded with a pep rally for the
first home football game. This
year, Homecoming happened to
fall on the first home football game.

When Rosie Molinary, Union
Board Social Vice President, con-
fronted the Athletic Department
about changing the date, “they were
really disappointed.” All things
considered, Molinary thinks Lu-
nar Luau should remain on the
same date in the future.

“You can’t divorce a tradition
that is founded in so much emo-
tion,” she says.

Rudell continues quest

for basketball courts
Back up site: field behind Martin F

By Jay Jennings

The outdoor basketball court
issue will continue this week in
Tuesday’s SGA meeting, but with
a new variable.

The SGA will not only vote on
the proposed location at the park-
ing lot above the tennis courts, but
also on a new site behind the new
senior apartments.

The new site would not take
away any parking, which might
reduce some student opposition to
the courts. The court would be

located in the grass area between

Martin Court building F and the
soccer practice field.
Potential problems with this

‘location are that the court would

not be as centrally located as the
tennis court parking lot and that
the noise might disturb some resi-

dents. Despite the fact that the
proposed location is near the se-
nior apartments, Senior Class Presi-
dent B.J. Rudell hopes the courts
would be used by all classes.
Rudell has not decided
whether to suggest only one or
both of the proposed sites at this
week’s SGA meeting. He hopes to
hear student opinions on the issue
before he decides, because he “‘rep-

resents the students.”
Erik McMichael, a resident in

the new apartment building, says
the new site would be a good loca-
tion and that the noise “would not
cause any more of a problem than
music.”

Students are urged again to
express opinions to their represen-
tatives before Tuesday’s SGA
meeting.

Kuykendall speculates about
what improved our rating

Why not 7? from page |

port considers the ratio of full-
time students to full-time faculty,
the percentage of full-time faculty
with doctorates, thespercentage of
part-time faculty, the average sal-
ary of a full-time faculty member,
and finally a class size measured
by the proportion of classes with
fewer than 20 students as com-
pared with the proportion that had
50 or more students.

What changes improved
Davidson’s ranking? Director of
Institutional Research Dr. John
Kelton emphasizes, that Davidson
has made significant efforts to im-
prove the quality of faculty re-
sources. Davidson has avoided
hiring part-time faculty and ac-
cording to Kelton, the student/fac-
ulty ratio remains “‘on the low side
of 12 to 1, more like 11.6 to 1.”

Do the rankings affect

admissions? |

Cable Wells does not consider
the rankings to be the central deci-
sive factor for people applying to
Davidson, though she acknowl-
edges that they are one consider-
ation. “A combination of factors,

including selectivity and quality,
are all significant when one takes a
look at a quality school,” says Cable
Wells.

Where do other schools stand?

Though Washington & Lee is
geographically Davidson’s clos-
est Southern liberal arts competi-
tor at #15, Cable Wells cites the
greatest competition as coming
from universities such as Duke,
Chapel Hill, and the University of
Virginia. Northeastern schools
provide competition, drawing from
a similiar applicant pool. .

SGA... President __ Eric
Rosenbach is pleased by the re-
sults of the survey: “It’s exciting
to see Davidson get the recogni-
tion it deserves. From now on it
seems that we can only build on the
reputation of the institution and
improve even more.”

In general, the Davidson com-
munity is taking the news of the
top ten ranking casually.
Kuykendall remarks that Davidson
has never been drastically affected
by the rankings: “It’s nice to have
others speak well of you, but nicer
to just continue doing your job.”
