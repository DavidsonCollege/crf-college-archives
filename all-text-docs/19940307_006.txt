Give us a bid.

This weekend the men’s basketball team lost a heartbreaker in the finals of
the Southern Conference tournament. Inthe énd we had our chances, but the shots
just wouldn’t fall. But amid the sorrow of losing a championship, Davidson
players and fans alike walked away having gained something. For the second time
in two years, Davidson sports went national, and, for a few glorious moments, we
all shot every three-pointer and felt every foul right along with the team.

Let us not forget whom to thank for getting us there. Over the last twelve
months, the coaches and players have made a commitment to succeed and aimed
to capture the Southern Conference bid to the NCAA tournament. Hard work paid
off as Davidson won 20 regular season games for the first time in 25 years. Coach
Bob McKillop was named Coach of the Year, and Janko Narat and Brandon
Williams were both selected to the All-Conference and All-Tournament teams.

Over the course of the season, Davidson students and faculty gradually could
not stop talking about “our team.” The look of devastation in the fans’ eyes
Sunday night shows how much we have grown to love this team. We want them
to win not just for ourselves, but for people like Coach McKillop and seniors Janko
Narat and Jason Zimmerman who have been through the tough times. The NCAA
selection committee has never sent two Southern Conference teams to the “Big
Dance,” the NCAA Tournament, but if there ever was a time, it ought to be now.

With a 22-7 record and decisive victories over ACC and Metro teams, despite
being the smallest Division I school in America, we deserve to be considered
seriously for an at-large bid. The players and coaches have worked so hard all
season long. We know the season is not over. Let’s savor the victories our team
has given us and hope our next game is in the NCAAs.

Where will the poor get an oven?

To the editors,

I was utterly incensed
when reading Bill Gullan’s
painfully callous and clearly
misinformed respose to Kim
Kreiling’s article in
theprevious issue.

It is not my intention to
defend Kreiling’s position
that our country must insti-
tute a broad system of so-
cialized housing as a simple
and definitive solution to the
problem of homelessness.
While homelessness is, in
its narrowest definition, a
lack of housing, it is the re-
sult of myriad social prob-
lems which would not be
erradicated by a subsidized
apartment. On this point, I
find myself reluctantly al-
lied with Gullan.

_However, Gullan’s ig-
norance as to the nature of
the problem and the realities
of poverty are a far greater
concern than any disagree-
ment with Kreiling’s ap-
proach. Gullan cries, “...why
complain about the gap?
Why, if both extremes are
benefiting, is this situation
intolerable?”

Is he suggessting that
there is some advantage to
being destitute? How is this
possible? Gullan later as-
serts that as long as the guy
playing the saxophone in the
subway makes a few bucksa
day, which apparently con-
stitutes progress for Gullan,
we need not worry, much
less complain, about the in-
credible gap between the rich
and the poor.

What Gullan has failed
to understand is that the
frightening aspect of this dis-
parity is neither its magni-
tude nor even the fact that
such a difference exists.
Rather, it is the miserable
condition in which some in-
dividuals in this country ex-
ist, a level which is deplor-
able regardless of its rela-
tionship to the wealth of oth-
ers.

True, many Americans

their fellow citizens spend
appalling, yet it is not their
opulence but the knowledge
that there are some who are
absolutely unable to meet
their basic needs, that is ulti-
mately so disturbing.

In the course of his last
two articles, Gullan has
called for the government to
stop interfering in the affairs
of its citizens and cites pub-
lic education and transpor-
tation as examples of gov-
ernment inefficiency and
incompetance. Perhaps Gul-
lan would prefer to abandon
all public assistance and in-
stitutions in order to be free
of that “New American Sla-
very” called government?

Think of it...we could
discontinue federal aid to
college students, leave
everyine to their respective
saxophones and mutual
funds to earn their educa-
tional dollars, and in the end,
everyone would get only
what they paid for. Isn't that
justice according to Gullan?
More importantly, the fed-
eral government would not
make Gullan pay for things
that do not benefit [him].

Perhaps I have miscon-
strued Gullan’s article for
my Own purposes. If that is
the case, my only retort is
that Gullan takes a similar
journalistic “privilege” in his
article. His outrageous ex-
ample of Homeless Joe mov-
ing from his cardboard box
to a Beverly Hills mansion
flatly ignores Kreiling’s
statement that her proposed
subsidies would “always” be
limited.

Gullan further reveals a
lack of comprehension in his
Statement that a homeless
person would not be in such
a position if they had a job.
Have you ever attempted to
get a job without your re-
spectable clothes, a full meal
in your tummy, a clean
shave, and a permanent ad-
dress?

Most reprehensibly,

“untrained and thus far un-
successful” individuals.
Where does he think home-
less people come from? Are
they born so?

It is my understanding
that a significant number of
homeless people were once
gainfully employed, hence
trained and at least
somehwhat successful,
when aseries of misfortunes,
which may or may not have
been their fault, caused a
drastic change in their posi-
tion.

Whatever the circum-
Stances leading up to a
person’s homelessness,
without some sortof aid from
either public or private
sources, be it in the form of
employment, housing, food,
health care, clothing or some
other benefit, how can any-
one reverse their situation?

While Gullan clearly
never expects to be in need
of federal assistance himself,
one would think he would
have taken the time to step
outside his comfortable ex-
istence to examine the situa-
tion a bit more extensively
before writing his little dia-
tribe.

Inhis attempt to tap into
the reader’s patriotism, Gul-
lan alludes to the idealistic
notion of American society
as a meritocracy, implying
that we have already
achieved this goal and equal
opportunity is guaranteed for
all. Does he honestly be-
lieve everyone in this coun-
try starts out on the same
footing, completely unaf-
fected by their family’s fi-
nancial and social situation,
their race, their religion, and
their gender? Surely he
could not be so naive.

Gullan closes with an
attempt at quotability with
the words: “We need not give
the poor bread, but teach
tham to bake.” What I want
to know is where are they
going to get the oven?

Sincerely,

find the amount of money Gullan calls homeless people Caroline Carpenter, '96
