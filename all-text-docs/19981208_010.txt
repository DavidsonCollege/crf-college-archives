THE DAVIDSONIAN

SPORTS

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1998

By Mike ANDERSON
Sports Editor

The first few weeks of the 1998-99
campaign proved to be adizzying roller-
| coaster of aride forthe Wildcat women.
Landmark victories against Wake
Forest University and the University of
North Carolina-Charlotte offered
glimpses of brilliant potential. But these
wins were accompanied by some early-
season struggles—namely, a disap-
pointing performance at the pre-season
NIT Tournament and a conference-
opening upset defeat at the hands of
Chattanooga, ateam expected to reside
near the basement of the Southern Con-
ference this season. Davidson entered
this weekend’s tournament with a 2-3
overall record and an 0-1 mark in South-
ern Conference play.

But head coach John Filar has
seen some promising signs in these
early-season competitions and is confi-
dent that the turbulence will subside,
giving way to smoother sailing and
perhaps even a fourth consecutive
record-breaking season. “If the way
we’ ve. responded after two big losses
means anything, then it’s going to be a
really good season. To bounce back
after the Southwest Missouri State game
to beat Wake, and then from the Chatta-
nooga game to beat Charlotte is prom-
ising.”

It looks like that glaring headline
in the Davidson College viewbook was
right: Character counts. Filar and his
‘Cats have capitalized upon the team’s
never-say-die attitude and consistent
diligence on the practice floor.

Jamie Brown described the team’s
ability to remain resilient through the
rocky beginning. “We were all very
upset about the SMS game, it was a

poor showing. But we knew that there
was a lot more we had to do, and it
didn’t seem hopeless. We still had a lot
of confidence in the players we have
and the things our team can do. We
weren’t about to give everything up
over one game.”

Davidson 82
Wake Forest 75

Senior captains Jen
O’Brien and Jamie
Brown led the way with
21 and 19 points, respec-
tively, as the Wildcats
rolled to a key victory over
an ACC opponent. Jess
Montrella added a double-
double (10 points and 11
rebounds). “It was huge,”
beamed Jamie Brown. “To
have a win over a team like
Wake Forest is such a great §
opportunity for us to show
that the Southern Conference
can play with teams in the
top conferences.” Filar }
agreed, “Wake was a huge
win. It was another key game
to pick ourselves up. It was
ahuge win forus onan ACC ,
floor against a team that
was much better than they
were last year.”

Davidson 70
Georgia Tech 88

The Lady ‘Cats hosted
Georgia Tech at Belk Arena
with a crack at delivering
the first-ever victory by a

Davidson basketball team over an ACC
opponent on that floor. But Kenya Wil-
liams scored 34 points and the Yellow
Jackets handed the ‘Cats their second
loss of the season. Jamie Brown paced
the team with 13 points, while Kerry
Brown, Katy Kamp, and Janna
Magette each added 11. Magette came
off the bench to knock down 3 of her 5

shots from béhind the three-point arc.

November 28
Davidson 84-
Chattanooga 86

The ‘Cats were expected to roll
over Chattanooga, taking their first step
toward a predicted first place finish in

the Southern Confer-
ence. But UT-C lit it
up, from the outside,
knocking down 11
three-pointers. Jamie
Brown again led all
scorers with 21, while
Jess Montrella
pitched in 14 points
and Magette came off
the bench with 12, all
from behind the arc.
Kerry Brown deliv-
ered a team-high 6 as-
sists and 4 steals along
with her 11 points.
- Sophomore Jessica
_ Heath continued to de-
| liver quality minutes in
the post. “Jessica Heath
has improved one hun-
| dred percent. And I
don’tthink you’ re even
seeing anything close
to how strong a player
she can be. She’s re-
ally committed herself
since we’ve started
practice. She can re-
ally bea force inside.”
But Davidson’s de-
fense was unable to
contain
Chattanooga’s out-
side shooting. “We
did a poor job of rec-

ognizing what we had to stop. We ran
into ateam that was just red hot from the
outside, and we did a poor job of de-
fending on the perimeter.” said Filar.
The coach reflected, “After that loss, I
thought we were in a very bad spot.”

Davidson 74
UNC Charlotte 64

The Lady ‘Cats hosted UNC-Char-
lotte one week ago and delivered a
crucial win at home against the 49ers.
Davidson jumped out to a first-half lead
and never looked back. Katy Kamp
had a season-high 18 points and Kerry
Brown tallied up 17. Montrella shot
70% from the floor on her way to 14
points. Filar was pleased with the per-
formance, “We knew that they were
going to come’ in here pretty hungry
because of what we did to them in their
place last year. We’re starting to de-
velop a really nice neighborhood ri-
valry, and it’s nice to be on the top end
of it right now.” The coach continued,
“This was a really big game for Katy
Kamp. She’s such a power player and
when she gets on a roll, she’s going to
be tough to stop.” The coach also had
high words of praise for the freshman
marksman: Janna Magette (conve-
niently, rhymes with: “nothing but net’’).
The 3-point specialist is shooting well
over 50% from the 3-point line this
season, averaging double-digits scor-
ing off the bench. “She came in tonight
and hit some shots from way down-
town. That’s the spark we need from
Janna off the bench. When people came
off the bench like that and give you a
spark, it really picks everybody up.”
