Beavers Plan
Second Salem
Davidson Day

Duke-Davidson Game, Picnic,
and Dance Will be Fea-
tures of the Day
The Davidson College Beaver
Club, Honorary undergraduate or-
ganization, will sponsor a second
Salem Day, similar to that held on
the Davidson campus two years ago,
in Winston-Salem Saturday,

September 26

The idea originated and has been
pushed from the Salem end by Lib
Johnson of Winston-Salem a
student at Salem and sister of Dr.
Frontis Johnson, professor of His-
tory at Davidson.

Davidson-Duke Game

Present plans call for the David-
son boys to take their Salem dates
to the Duke-Davidson football game
being held in Winston-Salem that
day. After the game, Salem College
will be hosts to the Davidson boys
at a picnic and an informal dance
to be given on the college grounds.
As far as was known at the time
the Davidsonian went to press, ad-
mission prices to the game will be
fifty cents each for boys and their
dates.

Transportation, the most ,perplex-
ing problem for the Beaver Club,
has been provided for in the form
of extra sections on the 10:49 A, M.
bus leaving-Davidson for Winston-
Salem. The bus company practic-
ally guarantees passage for all stu-
dents buying round-trip tickets to
the event, and tickets will be good
either for return on the midnight
bus leaving Winston-Salem Satur-
day ‘night, or students—may—-stay
over and return the next day. Carter
urged, however, that all students
who plan to go catch the 10:49 bus
from Davidson, as later buses
put tfiem in Winston-Salem
too late to see the game He also
urged that all Davidson students
who can, sign up for dates ac Saleim,
or if they already have them, to
report them to him so that arrange-
ments can be made.

Latest Addition to School Pro-
gram Features An Ob-
stacle Course

By JIM STIMSON
Last week in the midst of regis-
tration, re-examinations, rush-week,
and the beginning of classes David-
son inaugurated a physical educa-
tional program for all students
enrolled for the year 1942-43.

.

In spite of a good summer for
healthful exercise, many joints
were stiff and began to crack as
“Pete” Whittle and others counted

1,2— 1,2 in leading the calisthenics.

After a few minutes of light work-
out many: found that they were
sweating like horses. The unusu-
ally hot weather and the luxuries
of rush week made it hard, physio-
logically speaking.

Obstacle Course

The athletic department intro-
duced a new set of equipment to
the students. This was the obstacle
course which is located just beyon
the intramural field at the beginning
of the cake race course—and, speak-
ing of this, the obstacles might be
a good addition to the cake course.

The college authorities began this
program in an endeavor to prepare
Davidson for physical
strain through which many of them
shall need to go in future months
and years on account of the war
situation. Last winter a_ similiar
voluntary program began ‘The, at-
tendance was very good, but the
coaches found that more organiza-
tion was needed. The program last
year consisted of calisthenics and
football or soccer. ~

Graded

This year practical education has
become’ a regular part ofthe cur-
riculum. student is re-
quired to sign up for a class, which
meets three times a week, and will
receive absences and tardies and a
grade of “satisfactory” or “un-
satisfactory.” Only students en-
gaged in intercollegiate sports are
excused, from the physical exercise
during the time in which his par-
ticular sport is in season.

Mr. Whittle announced that six-
teen sections are now taking phy-
sical education. _When the-weather
changes more time will be spent in
