THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINI ONS MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1992

Who Is Lauch Faircloth &
Who Paid for His Victory?

By Tom Koonce

North Carolinians failed once
again. When given the chance to
re-elect a respected and honored
senator, the citizens of this state
chose an organization and its pup-
pet candidate.

Lauch Faircloth was a demo-
crat until last year, but when he
and the National Congressional
Club (a Raleigh political action
committee), realized that Senator
Terry Sanford was one of the more
vulnerable senators on Capitol
Hill, Faircloth switched his party
allegiance tothe Republican camp
and eventually became controlled
by the ultra-conservative, Jesse
Helms' led, Congressional Club.

The club completely man-
aged all aspects of Faircloth’s suc-
cessful campaign and took that
right-wing crusade to lower lev-
els than they had for Helms in
1984 or 1990. The majority of
North CarolinaRepublicansdidn’t
even rally around Faircloth. In
Raleigh, the GOP held their elec-
tion night party across town from
where Faircloth and the club were
celebrating. This showed thateven
Republicans in North Carolina

weren’t proud to call Faircloth one
of their own.

Senator Terry Sanford, a
former governor of this state and
Duke University president, exem-
plifies everything that is just and
pure in the Senate. Despite his
defeat, Sanford’s record of public

"even Republicans
in North Carolina
weren't proud to call
Faircloth one of their
own,"

service should make the people of
this state proud. In his years as a
senator Sanford performed well
for North Carolina and the coun-

He chaired the Senate Ethics
Committee and served on the For-
eign Relations Committee. In his
campaign this year Sanford
stressed his support for improved
health care, tax breaks for invest-
ments that create jobs, and fully
funding childhood programs such
as Head Start.

- But the majority of the people
in this state chose to ignore
Sanford’s fine history and agenda
and elected a man who has no real
credentials for the job. Faircloth
rarely spoke for himselfin his cam-
paign; instead herelied on the Con-
gressional Club to run the race for
him.

Theclub, an appropriatename
for a conservative organization
where upper-class senior white
males work to preserve their rights
atthe expense of limiting the rights
of minorities, bombarded North
Carolina with negative ads which
distorted Sanford’s record as a
senator.

Sanford’s campaign seemed
caught off guard by this kind of
dirty campaign and did not effec-
tively respond to the club’s false
charges until it was too late.

Sanford himself did not seem
motivated enough to organize and

lead the kind of campaignthatwas .

needed to shoot down the accusa-
tions made against him by theclub.

Maybe it was Sanford’s health
that persuaded many voters to

and racial pride is a big aspect of
that. If you’re a minority, and

Fortunately, the learned as-

agreed to explain the whole mess.
He spoke at length of angles of
solar whatchamacallits, Vernon’s
equinox, and some other indeci-
pherable stuff. He sketched some
diagrams on thechalkboard, with
explanatory formulas for my ref-
