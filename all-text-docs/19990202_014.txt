Wildcats drop key contest to ETSU

By Mike ANDERSON

Davidson continued their skid
down the Southern Conference stand-
ings on Saturday, dropping. their con-
test against East Tennessee State Uni-
versity to mark the ‘Cats’ third loss in

- four
Davidson 54 games.
ETSU 75 | With the

defeat,

Davidson fell to sixth place in the South-
ern Conference.

Thanks to a pair of upsets on the
day (Wofford defeated second-place
Georgia Southern and top-notched
UNC-Greensboro fell to Western Caro-
lina), the Wildcats are still but three
games out of first place. But they'll
have to leapfrog five teams over the
next few weeks in order to claim the
SoCon regular season championship.

Though that prospect is looking

increasingly distant, it is by no means
out of reach. Davidson has six games
remaining—with chances to hand losses
to the three top teams of the conference
(UNC-G, Georgia Southern, and
Furman) as well as opportunities to
rack up victories against the
conference’s basement dwellers (West-
ern Carolina, College of Charleston,
and Wofford).

“With everybody beating up on
each other,” head coach John Filar
pondered, “you just can’t tell. We're a
team that could go anywhere from sixth
place to first place, that’s an unbeliev-
able range.”

The teams played evenly to a 31-
31 half-time score, but then the bottom
fell out: Davidson shot a mere 33%
from the floor and 50% from the free
throw line in the second half. ETSU’s
Buccaneers outscored the ‘Cats 44-23
inthe latter twenty minutes on their way
to a 75-54 victory. The Wildcats’ point
total for the evening fell 25 points be-

for an open team-

low their season average.

Davidson was without the services
of leading-scorer Jamie Brown, whose
MRI last week confirmed she had in-
deed torn meniscus (cartilage) in her
knee. Brown had been playing on the
injury for approximately a month,
Arthroscopic surgery could repair the
tear, but would also pose a month-long
recovery period, jeopardizing the star’s
likelihood of returning to form in time
for the Southern Conference Tourna-
ment. .

“T’ ve decided to wait until after the
season for the surgery,” Brown said. “It
feels a lot better than it has recently. I’m
going to try to play this next weekend.”

A factor in the ‘Cats struggles
through this half of the season has been
a lack of scoring balance. In early-
season action, it wasn’t uncommon to
see five or six players scoring in double-
digits.

In Saturday’s loss, seniors Jessica
Montrella, Kerry Brown, and junior
Jen O’Brien scored 44 of the team’s 54
points. The remainder of the ‘Cats lineup
contributed only 10 points in 97 min-
utes of floor time on 4-22 shooting.

Freshman Leah Uhernik started
her first game of the season, filling in
for the injured Jamie Brown. Uhernik
pulled down six rebounds on the night,
but the freshman could not alone offset
the scoring deficiency created by Jamie
Brown’s absence—the senior captain
out of Pennsylvania leads the Wildcats
with almost 16 points per game.

“T think we can always make up
for points and rebounds if we're miss-
ing a player,” commented Brown. “But
jumbling up a lineup will always throw
any team for a loop. It was a tough
assignment for our freshmen to be
thrown into the mix and expecting them
to score points, but they’ ll be ready for
it (Monday).”

Davidson traveled to Charleston
last night, and will then visit Western
Carolina on Saturday before returning
home to take on league-leading UNC-
G on Monday night.

“With the way teams are winning
and losing,” said Jamie Brown,” we
still have a chance and we have to

‘remember that. We still have the ability

to come in first.”
