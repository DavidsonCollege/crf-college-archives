Walker and Judy hope for further growth in the EAC

Mary Lee of the Davidsonian recently

iat down with Amanda Walker and

Meredith Judy to talk about their roles
1s co-chairs of the Environmental Ac-
‘ion Coalition, a student-led organiza-
‘ion that formed last year as a result of
‘he merger of the environmental and
recycling groups.

The Davidsonian: How
ind when did you become
involved in environmen-
‘al action?

Walker: Environmen-
‘alism has always been
my thing. I have been
involved in environmen-
tal action at Davidson
since my freshman year,
when I signed up with the
environmental group at
the activities fair, Sopho-
more year I was co-chair,
and have been very ac-
tive since.

Judy: I originally joined as a member
of the recycling group that went to the
shed every week to sort the recyclables.
Last year the coalition formed, and I
have enjoyed working on lots of differ-
ent environmental issues.

D: Describe your recycling program.

W: Weare focused on recycling educa-
tion and are using Richardson as a model
dorm to show students how and what
can be recycled. We want to make
everyone well-informed, so that invest-
ing more money into the recycling pro-
gram will be worthwhile. Right now,
our biggest challenge is that everything

with Amanda Walker &
Meredith Judy

isn’t uniform.

Students should know two things
about recycling at Davidson. First, you
don’thave to sort your recyclables. Just
put them in blue plastic bags. Second,
you can’t recycle glass.

D: How has the environmental action
group
changed
since your
involve-
ment with
it began?

J: We
were both
members
of each or-
ganization
(recycling
and envi-
ronmental
action),
and now
we work at both. The coalition makes
recyclingymuch more widespread and
easier to do.

D: What other programs do you sup-
port?

W: We organize letter-writing, clean-
ups along Interstate-77 and in nature
preserves, the Davidson Earth Day cel-
ebration, paper padding (binding old
flyers into notepads), and speakers at
Davidson.

D: Do you have a wide-based student
and faculty involvement?

J: At every meeting we have about 20
people. Dr. Martin and Dr. Annie

Ingram serve as advisors, and the physi-
cal plant is really helpful with the recy-
cling aspect.

W: The freshmen were pretty excited
this year. Lots of them were already
active recyclers when they got to
Davidson and told us, “We need more
blue bins.” We now have about 80
people involved in some way with the
coalition.

D: How do you see the future of the
environmental group at Davidson?

W: Isee recycling becoming so com-
mon that ef-
forts can be
done to ad-
dress bigger
environmen-
tal problems,
through letter-
writing cam-
paigns. Pos-
sibly, environ-
mental action
could propel
Davidson stu-
dents to be
more political.

D: What are
your goals for
Davidson and
the environ-
ment?

J: I'd like to
see an Envi-
ronmental
Ethics take
hold here at

belief that expands throughout campus.
It would be great if the environment
were discussed in the classroom, in the
Commons, in the Union, I wish it were
just something we did.

W: I want environmental awareness to
expand toevery aspectof students’ lives,

D: What, if anything, do you ask fellow
students to do to make Davidson more
environmentally aware?

W: Think about it (the environment).
Look at signs on the-walls about what
you can and can’t recycle. Think about

ro

what your actions do and consider your
role as just one part of an ecosystem.
J: Our future depends on our protection
of resources now. We have the chance
to develop good habits now that will
carry beyond Davidson. If you are
concerned about an issue, talk to people.
Tell the physical plant or tell us. The
more people who speak out about an
issue, the better we all will be.
