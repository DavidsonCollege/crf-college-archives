and Chris Otrok, the men’s cross-
country team tied for 4th in the Big
South Conference Meet in Sum-
merville, SC this past Saturday.

In Davidson’s first ever Big
South championship competition,
the men made a strong showing
and tied with Campbell, finishing
behind Coastal Carolina, Baptist,
and champion Radford.

Davidson’s squad saw its top
tworunners receive all-conference
honors (by finishing in the top ten),
and placed their top five among the
first thirty runners.

‘Though the team’s place in the
Conference standings was a bit
disappointing, there has been vast

improvement in-depth from last.

ual performances were turned in.
Davidson was paced by an

sensational time of 26:24 for 5

Richardson’s steady improve-

In addition, Richardson and
Otrok now represent the tenth and
eleventh fastest Davidson men ever

The Wildcat’s top five included
Tan Stewart (27:13, 22nd), Pete
Hurtado (27:19, 24th), and Rich-
ard Wharton (27:39, 28th). This
depth, much improved in the last
year, was not enough to give
Davidson its first Championship.
Close behind were Cam Dauler

(28:24, 37th).

Beach, Marshall Shine
In Big South Meet

By PETER HURTADO

In Davidson’ s firstappearance
at the Big South Conference Cham-
pionship this weekend in Summer-
ville, S.C., the women’s cross-
country team made a deep impres-
sion, placing 3rdinan 8 team field.
———Fhe-Wildcats finished-just
points behind 2nd place Coastal
Carolina, and 18 points behind
champion Radford.

Davidson placed 3 runners in
the top eleven, and all seven in the
top 31 finishers.

The characteristic depth of this
season’s squad could not win a
championship, but with continued
improvement they should surely
challenge again next year.

Onceagain, the Lady Wildcats
were led by their “1-2” punch of
Kathy Beach and Karen Marshall,
Beach placed 2nd in.an outstand
ing time of 18:51.

Marshall finished just behind
in 3rd place (19:17).

Both women were named to
the All-Conference Team, and have
had outstanding seasons. Heather
Tarpley also ran well, placing elev-
enth (20:05).

The strong squad then placed a
string of runners, led by Senior
Laurie Reams (21st, 20:53), Jean

much improved Lisa Sitek (31st,
21:40).

The strong performance of all
seven women has been the team’s
trademark, and Saturday’srace was
no exception.

The presence of three strong
freshmen, and the return of fron-
trunner Beach should make
Davidson a contender again next
year.

Coach Gary Andrew was quite
pleased with this weekend’s cae
formance and, indeed, with
entire season. The women trave -

onships in two weeks at Furman.

Bro and Sis Rob and Jackie Ukrop exercise prowess in theft respective sport.

Ukrops Make It A Family Affair

By BRUCE PAGE

Athletics seem to come natu-
rally to the Ukrop family.
Rob.and Jackie Ukrop are
highly talented Davidson Wildcats,
and their father almost became one;
Bobby Ukrop was recruited for
Basketball in the 60°: Medion
toa‘standout career at Richmond.
Rob, a junior striker on the

"soccer team, ranks seventh nation-

ally in scoring and third in the Big
South Conference.

Thesenumbers have made him
an All-American candidate.

His sister Jacqueline has. -

been an important contributor to

the field hockey team, and has

haiped them to an 11-1-2:record. -
The Wildcats are on track to

finish with their best record ever.

Rob first became interested in
Davidson’ when his father and
grandfather told him stories about
his dad’s recruiting process here.

Jackie chose Davidson after
seeing the ‘school during her
brother’s freshman year.

Their coaches have ingy
but good things: to, say “about the ©
pair.

Even though Jacqueline tooka
year off from athletics to focus on
the academic side of Davidson, her
coach, Betsy Pryor, doesn’t feel
she missed a thing.

- “She has come in and made a
‘strong contribution right away,"
says Pryor. "She’s strong and up-
beat and has an abundance of en-
ergy. She’s:going for a goal every

timeout. It’ sa real tribute to her
athletic ability that she has done so
well after not playing last year.”
Soccer coach Charlie Slagle
voices similar sentiments about
Rob, citing his contributions as a
major factor in the soccer team’s
surge to a national ranking ¢ cartier
this season,
“Our players look for: Rob to
score," says Slagle, "he’s the great-
est scorer we’ve had at Davidson.
He’s improved his skills to the
point that I consider him a legiti-
mate All-American candidate.”
The Ukrops’ talent and_atti-
tude, and their impact on their
respective teams is making them a
most successful brother-sister
combination in Davidson athlet-
ics.
