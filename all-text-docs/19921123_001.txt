'Cats Win 6-5 On Penalty Kicks

Rob Ukrop draws a crowd of defenders in Sunday's win
over Coastal. The team now advances to a Final Eight
matchup with N.C. State Sunday.

Unlike last spring, unusual
current events have not drawn at-
tention tothe life of African Ameri-
can students at Davidson. How-
ever, this lack of visible tension
does not necessarily indicate that
the quality of life for minority stu-
dents has improved.

Students continue to express
serious concerns about the experi-
ence minorities and especially Af-
rican Americans have at Davidson.
These issues are repeatedly ad-
dressed at all levels in the college
in an attempt to understand what
might improve the situation.

Identifying the Problem

Only 85% of the black stu-
dents who entered their freshmen
year with the class of 1992 gradu-
ated from Davidson; 67% of those
who began with the class of 1991
graduated. Why is it that African
American students are generally
not satisfied with Davidson and
often decide to leas before gradu-
ation?

The high attrition rate has been
a problem at Davidson since the
first black students enrolled in the

1960’s. In the past ten years, the
college has analyzed the situation
and identified possibilities for im-
‘| proving the environment for the
entire campus.

In 1984 coll ege president,
John Kuykendall , established a
task force on racial and ethnic con-
cers in his first year as president
of the college. This report identi-
fied nine major concems, the back-
grounds of each concer, and rec-

African-American
Students Remain

Life at —

: ommendations for siiesible solu-
tions. The task force named social

stress as one. of the major factors
for-dissatisfaction. According to

the report, the social stress results

from the small number of black
students, the demographic make
up, attitudes of black and white
students, and the nature of the town
of Davidson.

After nearly four years at
Davidson, senior Anthony Foxx
continues to,battle the dissatisfac-
tion felt among black students. He
attributes the slow change in the
environmentoncampusto the com-
partmentalization of the problem
by the administration.

Foxx listed several areas
which have separated the concerns
of the African American students
from those of the students at large.
These include the curriculum, the
Deans’ Offices, the speakers, and

especially the social life.

The insufficient social life is a
direct result of the small popula-
tion of black students on campus,,
according to Travis Hinson, Presi-
dent of the Black Student Coali-
tion. Withonly 59 African Ameri-
can students on campus, it is diffi-
cult to find a niche of people with
not only the same cultural back-
ground, but also similar interests,

Hinson tells prospective stu-
dents truthfully about other diffi-
culties as well, including interac-
tion with professors and white stu-
dents who continually ask him to
speak as a resource representing

Unbelievable!

Penalty Kicks Again as 'Cats Top Coastal

By Bruce Balestier

Sometime around 5 p.m. Sun-
day afternoon, with darkness ap-
proaching, Davidson goalie Alex
Deegan finally earned a rest after
three and a half hours of
goalkeeping when he saved Coastal
Carolina’s Billy Johnstone’s pen-
alty kick. The save gave the #19
Wildcats, now 18-4-3, a 6-5 win in
a shootout, and earned them a spot
in the NCAA Tournament’s Final
Eight against #3 N.C. State next
weekend.

On the final save, Deegan
poked the ball up in the air and, in
his words, “just watched it float
over” the crossbar. He then was
mobbed in the corner of the field
by teammates and fans who had

stormed the field. Unbelievably, it
was-Deegan’s fifth save in the set
of ten penalty kicks, and not even
his most dramatic. Three times in
the shootout Deegan savéd shots
that would have won the game for
Coastal.

The Chanticleers took a 3-2
lead after the fourth set of kicks,
and needed only to hit their next
kick or stop the fifth Davidson shot
to win. But John Sampers, the hero
in last week’s victory over UNCC,
scored to the bottom left corner
and Deegan stopped Rob Williams
at the left post to knot the affair.

With the conclusion of the set
of five kicks, the match moved to
sudden death. When Coastal keeper
Bryan Hickey saved Cliff

Castelloe’s shot on the seventh set
of kicks, the.Chants stood to win
on the nextkick. But Deegan saved
Shane Gilstrap’s:shot to the right
post. In the same situation on the
ninth set of kicks, Deegan saved a
shot by Coastal’s Damon
Richvalski. Freshman Ryan
Northington scored with a left-
footed shot to the left corner before
Deegan stopped Johnstone’s shot.

The shootout followed 150
minutes of scoreless soccer (90
minutes of regulation time, two
15-minute overtimes and two 15-
minute sudden death overtimes)
marked mainly by the clutch play
of both team’s defenses and goal-

Davidson Considers Plans
{for New Student Union

Johnston Gym Seen as “Tdéal Location”

By Rachel Dunifon

Rumors about the possibility
of a new college union, after hav-
ing been circulated for years, may
soon be put to rest. According to
William Brown, Director of the
Union, plans for anew union “have
been under active consideration
since spring of ’85,” although it is
unclear when they will be imple-

‘mented.

Brown says that the key to
having a successful union is that it

be located in the center of commu-

nity life. “Going to the Union
should be something done without
even thinking,” Brown said. The

present Union location is not con-
ducive to this kind of traffic. “When
the infirmary was in its old loca-
tion, at least we had some sick
people dropping by,” said Brown.
Now the Union is out-of the-way
from almost everywhere on cam-
pus.

Brown, a ’70 graduate of
Davidson, says that the Union was
previously located where the li-
brary now is. Then, in 1975, a
planning committee decided that
spot would be the ideal location for
a new library, and the Union was
torn down. The director of the
Union: at that time said that the

only way that the Union could:re-
main viable if moved to its current
location would be if a student Post
Office was placed there to gener-
ate traffic. Because of community —
Opposition to that idea, however,
the Union now “is located on the
edge of campus with no major traf-
fic provider.”

No moves were made to
change the location of the Union
until 1985, when it became clear
that Johnston Gym would be va-
cated due to the construction of
Baker Sports Complex. Brown

Journalist Burnham Examines
Media's Affect on U.S. Electorate

By Christopher S. Edwards
On Wednesday, November
18, about 20 people gathered in the
900 room at 7:30 p.m. to hear David
Bumham, a former investigative
reporter for the New York Times,
speak about the media’s role in the
U.S. and how it affects the Ameri-
can electorate. Burnham was in-
vited to come to Davidson by his
friend Elizabeth Benedict, a visit-
ing professor of writing who grew
up in New York City reading

Bumham’s stories in the Times.
Burnham was a New York
Times reporter for fifteen years.
He aggressively coveréd such is-
suesas police corruption in the city
and federal regulations of such in-
dustries as nuclear power. He has
also worked for CBS and United
Press International. Having writ-
ten “The Rise of the Computer

State” in 1983 and “A Law Unto °
Itself” (dealing with the I.R.S.) in
1990. He is currently authoring a
book about the Justice Department.

Burnham believes that report-
ers are often “seduced” by news-
worthy or otherwise important fig-
ures who may influence how sto-

ries are written and may even cut
stories from publication. The me-
dia thus doesn’t provide the Ameri-
can people with a full, clear view
of what is going on in the U.S.
While there is no comprehensive
