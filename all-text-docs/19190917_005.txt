When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and Trust
Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to
“go to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then
a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in
touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen
his strong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good.
Drop us a line and ask us to give you full particulars.

Good morning.

“Why is the Davidsonian the livest

shocking news.”

We may put in a ‘political column

run the government.

We are thinking of running a far-

and give prizes amounting to $100 to
the winners. If 50,000 farmers sent us
an ear of corn each and if 100 ears
made a bushel, we ought to be able to
scll it for $1,000 and clear $900. High
finance, is it not?
