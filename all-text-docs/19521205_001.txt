LIFE SNUBBED D. C. CO-ED,
RETURNS TO PAY HER DUE

Mrs. Tom Daggy, secretary to
Dean Bailey, was rather pleasantly
surprised last Wednesday afternoon
when Judy Holden, a Life maga-
zine correspondent, called the
Dean’s office to get, some informa-
tion about Davidson's only co-ed,
Mary McGill, whose father is the
college Bursar.

It seems that upon reading Life's
story about the one coed among
some 900 boys at Colorado Mines,
several students wrote to Life, say-
ing in substance, “They ain't got
nothin’ on us.”

The call from Life’s headquarters
was due to these letters, Mrs.
Daggy supplied all the pertinent
information on Miss McGill's
status as.a Davidson coed, includ-
ing her courses, plans for a major,
etc.

No information was forthcom-
ing from Life as to how they plan.
ned to use thts information in a
story, but Mrs. Daggy surmised
from her conversation with Miss
Holden that it would be used in
the “Letters to Editor’ column.

These Are The Guys You're Helping

-

3rd ROKA Hospital: Dr. Torrey, the man 1 who is credited with
having begun the movement, with quadruple, bilateral leg and

bilateral arm amputee.

Contest: Tues.

Will the freshmen be able to
discard their crimson headgear for-
ever or will they be compelled to
wear the hated beanies until the
end of the first semester?

Freshman-Sophomore day will
answer the question.

On Tuesday, December 9,
at 3:45 p.m., the annual fresh.
man-sophomore competitive
games and festivities will get
under way on Richardson Field.
If :the freshman teams win two

out of the three events, then all
the freshmen are free to burn their
hats and go bareheaded as they
please.

But woe to the frosh if they
lose. Judge Barry of the
Court of Control stated that
he expected the freshmen to
show lots of spirit and that if
they didn’t “it will be too bad
for them.”

The first event will be a footbali
game played according to inter-
fraternity rules; the game will see
a determined freshman eleven cap-
tained by Moffet Ware and Joe
Billy Pharr pitted against the
forces of the sophomore crew.

From the numerous varsity
football players and the fra-
ternity ball handlers, the fresh-
man class should be able to col-
lect a potent team capable of
giving the sophomores a run
for their money.

During the half time, a 400-yard
relay track event will be staged.
Bill Morris, a junior class member,
is to be in charge of selecting four
speedy freshmen to run on the re-
lay team.

Immediately following the foot-

ball game, the battle of beef

and brawn—the tug of war—
will take place.

Big Bilt Taylor will lead a heavy

Amputees Need
Told By Tragic

Korean Reports

By CHARLIE HASSELL

There is a need.

“Tragic terrified eyes blinking to
restrain tears stared through the
mass of bandages. The lad. about
ten ‘years old, sat tensely by his
mother on a bench in the hall of
the Taegu Presbyterian Hospital.
What little could be seen of his
face through the bandages wa:
lacerated and streaked with ‘!ood
Vainly he tried to conceal his arm:
and their blood soaked wrappinks
The left hand was gone above the
wrist. Several fingers were imis+-
ing from the right hand. The an-
guish of those frightened suffering
eyes haunted me. Shock, agony, and
hopelessness were etched in the
lines of the child's face.

Then his eyes caught sight of the
hook at the end of my mechanical
arm as it opened and closed on a
note book. He was fascinated.
With. such a contraption maybe he
could do something. Maybe he
would be less of a burden to his
parents, Maybe — maybe — life
might be worth living after all.
This boy, who had picked up a
discarded missle in the fields, was
only one of the growing number
of Korean children being multilated
by forgotten land mines, t-end gre-
nades and unexploded shells that
infest the fields and hillsides of
Korea. .

Little bodies muittitated by high
explosives, pitiful, grotesque faces
resulting from napalm burns have
touched the hearts of the United
Nations soldiers. They have raised
a fund to help rehabilitate these
innocent victims of war. Your gifts
are needed too,”

The above was written by
Dr. Reuben A. Torrey, director
of the Korean Rehabilitation
Propect. This is just one ex-
ample of the pressing need for
a rehabilitation program in
Korea.

There are some 30,000 Korean
war amputees, filling hospitals and
crowding the streets of Korea's
cities and towns. “Little has been
done for them and they are. for-
tunate if their wounds heal and a
crutch or stick enables them to
hobble out to swell the host of beg-
gars,” says Dr. Torrey.

There are, unfortunately, ap-
palling numbers of child ampu-
tees, such as those shown in
the pictures, and scores even

Three Win Prizes
Shooting Turkeys

Members of the faculty, admin-
istration, and their families com.
peted in the annual Turkey Shoo:
on November 21, sponsored by, the
ROTC Department.

In the men’s division the hottest
competition was among Professors
Spencer, Morton, McCutchan and
McGavock. Professor McCutchan
edged out this competition to win
in the division.

The winner of the women’s
division was Mrs. A. Heath
Whittle. The winner of the
Turkey Mystery was also a
woman, Mrs. John R. Cun-
ningham.

The turkey Mystery consisted of
shooting at a picture of a turkey
whose heart has been misplaced.
The person hitting nearest the par!
where the turkey’s heart had been
placed won the conest.

When Elgin White shot at the
picture, his strategy, intentional or
unintentional, was to miss the
whole picture. Mr. White won no
prize since there were no booby
prizes.

Large Bequeath
Left To Davidson

Mr. W. Z. Stultz, the man for
whom the sanctuary af the College
Church is dedicated, has left the
college over one-fifth of his estate,
according to the terms of his will.

Mr. Stultz, a prominent Char-
lotte businessman and member of
the Myers Park Presbyterian
Church, divided his estate among
five institutions in this state of
which Davidson is one.

In the Development program,
Mr. and Mrs. Stultz were
credited with the largest single
donation to the college and in
their honor a plaque is soon to
be placed in the church.

His death in October, followed
closely that of his wife who died
early in the summer. Dr. Cun-
ningham assisted in the services
of the funeral for Mr, Stultz.

The other institutions to which
the estimated estate of one million
dollars will be divided are: Queens
Coltege, Myers Park Presbyterian
Church, Barium Springs Orphan.

Home in Winston-Salem.

Long connected with the Reyn-
olds Tobacco Co., Mr. Stultz was
an investment banker in the latter
part of his life.

Of Navy On Tour

Dr. J. R. Cunningham has re-
cently returned from spending three
days as a guest of the United States
Navy at the Naval air base at Pen-
sacola, Fla, and aboard the air-
craft carrier USS Monterey.

Traveling with fifteen men from
the Atlanta Naval. District, North
and South Carolina and Georgia.
the group joined some forty col-
lege presidents, bankers, publishers
and prominent business men from
all parts of the country to observe
the air training program of the
Navy.

Dr. Cunningham, in an interview,
mentioned many interesting events
on the tour and commented par-
ticularly on the efficiency of opera-
tions and training of the Navy. He
was somewhat amazed, however, at
the apparent. lack of concern over
the loss of expensive equipment in
training exercises on these particu-
lar demonstrations.

The Navy’s purpose for the tour
was a part of a current program
to better acquaint the American
public with the actual training and
service of the Navy. The Navy
has expressed a need for more col-
lege graduates to enter this naval
air program,
