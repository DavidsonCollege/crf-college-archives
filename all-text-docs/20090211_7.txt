Blackout Baroque

Deemed a Huge Success

Charlotte—Last weekend the
brothers of the Delta Upsilon Fra-
ternity held a successful pledge
education/date event at the Char-
lotte Opera House.

“Dude, The Magic Flute puts
the Carolina Cup to shame,” said
brother Chad Patrick ’09. “T have
never been so wasted in my entire
life.”

Charlotte resident Midge Went-
worth “scopes the party”

The opera, not tradition-
ally associated with fraternity
events, was “Hang Out Central”

on Friday. The brothers of Delta

Upsilon started their night at their
fraternity house with some heavy
pre-gaming and then rode char-

ter buses into Charlotte. The DU
brothers, pledges, and dates soon
found themselves surrounded by
the wealthiest and best-educated
art patrons in the greater Charlotte
area. Undeterred, they proceeded
to “bro out” and “frat hard” while
being serenaded by the sweet
sounds of Mozart’s The Magic
Flute.

“T have never been so
wasted in my entire

life.”

“We knew after the Tchaik-
ovsky rush event last semester we
had to go back to the opera house.
We got so many acceptances and
the staff was cool with us booz-
ing and smoking so we were all
down,” Patrick commented.

Rather than conform to the
Carolina Opera’s normal standards
of decorum and restraint, DU
overthrew the security and audi-
ence in a wave of smoke, swear-
ing, and distinctly Southern dress.
“T was dressed in a seersucker suit

Union Board Hires World
Renowned Jazz Pianist

Alvarez Student Union—In an
effort to increase student happi-
ness and foster an environment of
stimulation and culture, the Union
Board has hired a jazz pianist to
play in the Union most weekday
nights. George Doubtfire, a criti-
cally acclaimed jazz pianist, will
call the second floor of the student
union “home” for the next three
years. Af-
ter a tour
throughout
the North-
east which
cumulated
in a solo
perfor-
mance at
Carnegie
Hall, he
has decid-

Doubtfire tickles the edhe wants
ivories to get back
to his roots
and play for students.

“He graciously accepted a very
low paying position. In fact, all he
wanted was a couple of crackers, a
can of spray cheese, and the chance
to mingle with the Union Employ-
ees,” Union Board Vice President
Hilary Flute said. ““We are so lucky
to have him, the effect on the stu-
dents has been tremendous. He has

been called the Yo Yo Ma of the
keyboard.”

Doubtfire, originally hailing
from Kalamazoo, Michigan, re-
cently moved to Charlotte. Doubt-
fire started playing the piano after
a freak foosball accident kept him
out of contact sports. His love af-
fair with the black and whites be-
gan shortly after.

“The summer of 89 I did noth-
ing but sleep and play piano. I hada
bedpan rigged up and a tube to feed
me. It was heaven.”

Music Professor Larry Usaf was
ecstatic when hearing the news.

“The man is a genius: I would
argue he has done more for the
piano than Picasso has done for
painting. I wish our student body
was more appreciative of his gift.”
When asked to describe Doubt-
fire’s style Usaf said, “imagine Ray
Charles, baptized by Judas Priest in
a tower of Earth, Wind, and Fire. A
magical smorgasbord of sound is
created and we are not worthy to
hear it.”

- Doubtfire is excited to be play-
ing in front of a younger crowd and
looks forward to his time at David-
son. The sleepy town of Davidson
may not be able to handle the ex-
citement that follows Doubtfire.

DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

, February 11, 2009

Craig Gregory ’11, DU brother
and patron of the arts

and a bowtie. Everyone brought
out their frattiest clothing for this.
It’s a Southern tradition. My dad
told me about the crazy times he
had when he pledged DU and saw
King Roger,” freshman Ryan Bop-
kins commented.

“T had passed out by the first
act, it was just too much for me
to handle. The guys were doing
keg stands and shotgunning beers

on the stage. The conductor took

a shot of Jagermeister with me.
It was ridiculous,” said president
Dale “Dip” Roberts.

This annual event has been a
Delta Upsilon tradition for as long
as anyone can remember.

Roberts reminded students,
“you know if you want the crazi-
est time and the best party of the
year, you go with DU to the opera.
Nobody throws down like my boy
Tamino. Nobody, bro.”

Phelps’ Big Hit

Michael Phelps, 14-time Olym-
pic medalist and 23-year-old swim-
ming champion, was shown smok-

ing from a marijuana pipe in a

University of South Carolina photo
last week and is now immersed in
controversy.

The photo has prompted a wide
range of reactions. He has been
suspended from competition for
three months and has been dropped
by several of his sponsors. Many
health and fitness professionals,
however, are delighting in this new
find.

“Weedies: Breakfast
of champions”

“We were always aware of
marijuana’s stimulating, energiz-
ing and strengthening properties,”
World Anti-Doping Administration
president Robert Marley stated in
a press conference this morning.
“However, until Mike confessed
to lighting up, we had no idea just
how critical this drug actually is in
the healthy development and im-
provement of the world’s greatest
athletes.”

U.S. Olympic team doctor
Mary-Jane Davids has issued a
press release of the most recent
list of WADA-approved perfor-

mance enhancers, which includes
pineapple juice, Gatorade Fierce,
and Captain Morgan. “These new
discoveries will forever change
the face of Olympic sports for the
better,” she said. “They all include
important substances which, when
inhaled, injected or snorted appro-
priately before competition, allow
the athlete’s body to perform far
beyond its normal limits.”

New sponsorship deals have
arisen out of the controversy. High

gave Phelps is the creation of a

hunger for new General Mills
victory breakfast cereal in

his honor. Weedies:
the breakfast of champions, should
be in local grocery stores by 4/20.
Coach Bud Blaze sees no rea-
son for alarm. “The boy can still
swim fine,” he said between puffs.
He first suspected Phelps’ pot use
years ago, when “he had blood red
eyes, but it ain’t from chlorine!”
