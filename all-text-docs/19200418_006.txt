THE DAVIDSONIAN, April &, 1920.

HI SOCIETY HAS
P SPLENDID MEETING

New Officers Elected at Joint Meet-
ing of Sections of Eu Society.

. Phi Society. .

The Phi Society showed that it
was alive Saturday night by holding
one of the best programs of the
season. As soon as J. W. Baldwin
had finished devotional exercises,
Nichols led off in the discussion of
the Irish Home Rule question. He
showed that he had learned at least
one thing from “his” law course, in
the requisites of a state. He proved
to his own satisfaction that Ireland
was in a position to have freedom.
L. G. Calhoun came back strong for
the negative and gave to the hall
the main issues as found in Public
Speaking. Dunlap, for the affirma-
tive, according to T. H. Spence, pr
distinguished himself as a speaker
who says nothing. L. L. Wilson told
the society there were some Sinn-
Feiners in Ireland, And McKeithan
went a step farther and said that
Lloyd George came from Ireland.
“Rifle Rest” Clark brought up the
rear by giving a famous analogy he
had learned in that “old crip” class.
The judges saw fit to decide in fa-
vor of the affirmative.

To give the extemporaneous
speakers time to prepare, C. Hunter
gave a remarkable discourse on
“Why empty seats are’empty.” Po-
teat in extempore told the audience
that “The Queens girls should be
given a permanent invite to the an-
nual field day exercises.” “Bugs”
Robinson tried to prove it wasn’t for
the best. But quite naturally the
decision was in favor of the affirm-
ative Spence, the official adjourner,
made the motion,.and in the absence
of Booker, Dunlap seconded the
move to adjourn, and the assembly
stood dismissed.

Eu Society.

The two sections of the Eumen-
ean Society met together Saturday
night for the purpose of electing ot-
ficers for next year. Only one set
of officers was elected. As usual
there will be a Freshman Society
during the fall term, and only one
section of upperclassmen. The of-
ficers elected were: J. C. McCas-
kill, president ; J. M. Richards, vice-
president; E. E. Houghton, secre-
tary; A. R. Ormand, reviewer; A.
M. Mitchell, treasurer; J. P. Price,
member debating council.

Like any weil drilled organiza-

tion, the house executed an “at
ease” with a thoroughness that
would have been quite astounding
to an outsider unaccustomed to
election customs. Campaign
speeches and rejoinders were a very
pleasing and informing feature.
‘Messrs, Liston, Craig, Price and
White were in evidence constantly
and amused the hall greatly by the
“freshness” of the facts(?) as to
the past lives and present statuses
of their candidates; in fact the elec-
tion of J. M. Richards as secretary
is to be attributed to Liston’s in-
genious appeal to the sympathies of
fellow sufferers: in the military
world by characterizing him as “the
gentleman wearing the wrap leg-
gins.” The versatile Price made an
excellent stump oration when he
nominated J. C. McCaskill for pres-
ident. His eloquence was eclipsed
a moment later by Craig in his
nomination of Mitchell for the same
office. Despite the fact that Obe-
ron’s “What fools these mortals
be” would have been remarkably
appropriate, the meeting was a very
enjoyable affair.

TEAMS SELECTED FOR

FRESH-SOPH DEBATE | ©

Excellent Contests in Both Societies
Eu Society.

Ten men entered the perliminaries
to the Fresh-Soph Debate for the
Eumenean Literary Society. The
subject of the debate was: “Resolv-
ed, That the United States should
have some form of Compulsory
Military Training.” The speeches of
all the contestants were well work-
ed up and were delivered with such
force that the judges had a hard

time to decide whose arguments
were the best. The winners were
Bitzer, Houghton and Cooper, with
Richards as alternate.
The negative side of the debate
seemed the most popular, seven of
the 10 men choosing that side. The
arguments advanced by both sides
were well thought out and on the
rebuttals cach contestant showed
that he really believed in the side
which he had chosen by the force
with which he counteracted the ar-
gumenits of the opposite side.
The judges of the contest were
Dr. Harding, Dr. J. M. Douglas and
Professor Hunt.
Phi Society.

The Fresh-Soph preliminary de-
bate was held in the Phi Society
Friday night to determine the men
that will represent the society in
the inter-society contest debate this
month. The query was: ‘“Resolv-
ed, That some form of Universal
Compulsory Military Training
Should be Adopted in the U. S.”
The question was ably discussed
pro and con, after which the judges
selected D. P. McGeachy, Jr., LeRoy
P. Burney and Lloyd J. Bray, with
J. F. Clark as alternate.

VARIED SUBJECTS CON-
SIDERED BY POLITY CLUB

Professor Shewmake Discusses
Reading; Dr. J. M. McConnell
Tells of Political Situation in

On last Tuesday night the Polity
Club held its usual semi-monthly
meeting. The regular program was
postponed and the club had the
_ pleasure of hearing two of the most
linstructive talks of the year.
| Professor Shewmake chose as his
‘subject the general topic of “Read-
_ing.” His subject was well covered
jand it was pointed out that every
j reader should have a balanced ration
in the selection of his reading ma-
terial as well as in other activities.
Using the phraseology of Bacon, he
divided reading matter into three
parts and divided the purpose of
reading similarly. The divisons of
reading as pointed out were as fol-
lows: The material that should be
, tasted; the material that should be
swallowed whole; and the material
that should be chewed and digested.
The purpose of reading was shown
to be threefold also: First, for
amusement; second, for informa-
(tion; and third, for study, with the
lidea of putting the knowledge thus
‘gained to some practical use. Pro-

fessor Shewmake’s talk was very in-
structive and the audience greatly
enjoyed his remarks,

Dr. J. M. McConnell then gave a
short talk on the political situation
in Mexico. Tracing briefly the trend
of affairs in this country from the
administration of Diaz up to the
{present time, Dr. McConnell gave
{the gathering some very interesting
‘facts concerning the attitude of
Mexico towards the United States.
He attributed the more or less hos-
tile stand which that country has
taken in the past to three reasons:
First, because the Mexican is jeal-
ous of the power of the States; sec-
‘ond, because to the Mexican the
Monroe Doctrine appears as a pat-
ronizing article; and third, because
in a number of cases the leaders
have emphasized the above in or-
der to strengthen themselves, po-
litically. Under the present admin-
istration the country and the people
are promised better conditions and
to the outside world the Carranza
‘overnment promises to be effectual

|

in the carrying out of these meas-
ures. Dr. McConnell was listened
to with intense interest and the club
had a very instructive and enter-
taining evening.

Men speak the truth as they un-
understand it, and women as they
think men would like to understand
it, and then they all act lies which
would deceive Solomon, and the re-
sult is a heart-rending muddle which
a half dozen open words would put
straight.—Kipling. °

“THE AMERICAN SHAKES-
PEARE” DISCUSSED
BY PROFESSOR KOCH |

North Carolina University Profes-
sor Delights Audience With
Select Readings.

Among the several lectures made
here this spring by various speak-
ers, none have been more interest-
ing and elevating than that made
by Professor Koch, of the Univer-
sity of North Carolina, to the great-
er part of the student body in Shear-
er Hall on Monday night, March
29, on “The American Shakespeare.”

After being introduced by Profes- ,
sor Currié, Professor Koch asked
the question, “Where are we at
along literary lines today?” Then
he said the few Americans who
could answer this question were
ashamed to. In speaking of the low-
ness of our modern dramatic com-
edies, he said that we are only try-
ing to live up to these standards,
made and supported by Charlie
Chaplin. But, he said, the “brain-
less” Charlie Chaplin comedy is to-
morrow supplanted by the vulgar-
ity of “Fatty” Arbuckle; while
Shakespeare is the same yesterday,
today and forever.

Professor Koch said that for five
years he had seen audience after
audience watch and listen spell-
bound to “The Merchant of Venice”
while right across the street the
lower class thronged one night to
see John Barrymore’s latest produc-
tion and the next day it was forgot-
ten. “There is nothing really funny
about Charlie Chaplin,” he said,
“and without his crooked legs he
would be as any ordinary man.”
Also in our comedies of today
everything is planned in advance
and there is no place for any imagi-
nation.

Professor Koch spoke of the fact
that we fail to appreciate Shakes-

peare as we should, because many |

teachers of English fail to utilize
his life. In the future we should
study more thoroughly this great
comprehender and creator of char-|
acter. He also said that in the earl-
ier days when one entered a barber
shop or any other public place, he
was handed an elevating play or
periodical; but today it’s a choice
between the Police Gazette and the
Saturday Blade.

very minute of the talk was en-
joyed by all present and we only
hope that the student body may be
so fortunate as to get some other
speaker of Professor Koch’s type
in the near future.

TRUE LOVE.

Jest a sittin’ by th’ fireplace,

In th’ warm light’s cheery glow,
En a watchin’ dreams en visions
In th’ firelight, come en go.

Oh, th’ joy th’ dreams kin bring ye!
Oh th’ hopes we dare not name!

As we sit thru magic hours

Seeing pictures etched in flame.

When I’m feelin’ sorter weary,
Sorter pine for sympathy,

Then I see my truest friend

A lookin’ frum th’ flames at me.

Eyes so tender like en lovin’,
With a message pure en clear.
Send my worries all a humpin’
En plumb fill me up with cheer.
that’s kinder lined with
wrinkles
Caused by worries not her own;
Cause th’ care that tumble on me
Air never borne by me alone.

HERE’S A TRIUMPH
FOR PROHIBITION

How It Has Furnished the World With a
- Valuable Beverage.

While the forces of prohibition were
working to the end that alcohol should
be banished from the U. S., there was
one man who was working along a
different line from either side in the
question. For seven years this man
labored in Chicago, to the perfection
of an idea he had conceived, that
lager beer had never in the past been
properly made.

When war time prohibition became
a fact, this man was not yet ready
with the perfection of his ‘dex, hence
brewers began the making of a new
unfermented “near beer,” a crude, un-
digestible, unhealthful product, which
nevertheless sold in large quanti:ies
everywhere.

On July 19,/of this year, the U. 8
government issued letters patent to
this man, for a new plan of brewing
and finishing beer, which he claims
should have been in use years ago to
make beer a perfectly ideal beverage
for -verybody, and in fact superior to
any known drink for all the family.

A crude experiwenta!l plant was first
ere-ted in Chicago, which proved por
fect in working detail. Immediately
the Golden Grain Juice Company, of
Minneapolis, contracted for this pat-
ent plant, which the had in working
order Oct. 30th, at a cust of $350,000.

This new product, known as MIN-
NBHAHA, pale and special (light and
dark), goes back fifty years in brew-
ing to the good old rich brew of the
old country. Modern beer contained
but little barley, being made mostly
of corn, rice. grains, meals, etc. ‘ The
hew patent brew is made of only bar
ley and hops; it is thoroly fermented

nd aged for four months, It fe thus
rich in digestive properties and high
flavor.

Just before filtering and pasteuriza-
don, the patent process ts introduced,
which by vacuum, and without boll
ing, removes the high wines (alcohol)
but not one whit of the low wines
(eol-* and flavor). Taste alone would
not and could not detect that the
alcohol was absent. It proved :o be
exhilarating, however, because of the
hops and carbonic gas.

The Chicago scientist has proved
that alcohol was not necessary in
beer, that in fact it was a detriment,
and so prohibition had a use {t was
never designed to, for it perfected
brewing to a point never dreamed of
before.

Minnehaha, pale and special, will
be shipped to any part { .e United
States by the Golden Grain Juice Co.,
Minneapolis, U. 8. A.—Advertigomen..
