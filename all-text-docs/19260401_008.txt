A unique program was presented at the
weekly “Y" service Sunday evening by ten
Queens College students, composing a depu-

tation from the Y. W. C. A. of that institu-
tion. The general topic discussed was
“Christian Leadership,” which was developed
in three interesting and instructive talks. |

The subjects of these talks were, first, '
“What a Leader Is," by Miss Frances Steele;

Shrum, president-elect of the Y. W. C. A.,
and a prayer by the leader.

Miss Steel in her talk, “What a Leader | some time during the year to the Y. W. C. A. |
Is,” ably outlined the requisites of a true | This deputation was sent this year in the fall. |

leader. A leader, she said, either drives
with a big stick or with the still small voice.
She urged that the students do not use the
big stick but adopt the still small voice of

service as a ruling factor in their lives, thus
‘| becoming Christian leaders. !

All the people cannot be world and na-
tional leaders, said Miss Owen, in her talk,
“Rewards of Leadership,” but to everyone
there opens opportunities to lead in some
small way at least. Leadership is not without
recompense, and unselfish service in Chris-
tian leadership always bring satisfaction and
happiness.

In her talk, “Conditions Needing Lead-
ers,” Miss Trent gave a startling challenge
to students. She pointed out the wide fields
waiting for leaders of the right sort and
stressed the appalling need for Christian
leaders.

Many Deputations

The Y. M. C. A. of Davidson College has
| assumed a larger sphere of responsibility than
‘service to its immediate membership in the

student body, and in accordance with this
widened vision has been carrying on a series
{of deputations, undertaken by the student
members, with the object of helping and up-
lifting the people of the surrounding country.
Last week two such trips were taken. A.
H. Hollingsworth, president of the “Y,”
attended the Rutherford Older Boys’ Confer-
ence, which was sponsored by the County Ki- |
wanis clubs. There were approximately one
hundred and seventy-five registered delegates
present. Mr. Hollingsworth spoke at the

Such meetings as these give the Davidson
men an opportunity to be of real~service to
their fellow men and thus to the Master to
whose service Davidson is dedicated.

Also last week, W. K. Pritchett performed
a like service, occupying the pulpit of the
Prospect Church, near Mooresville, at the
Sunday morning service. This is the third |

Miss Lutie Trent was the leader of the
program and introduced to the Davidson

part of the program. This consisted in a

Bob Miles to Speak to
Boys at Sunday Service

of

| Special Junior Speaking Service to}
be Held on Campus Lawn |

Rev. Robert Miles, of Richmond, Va., will
conduct the “Y” meeting Sunday evening.
His subject has not been announced yet, but
| he can be depended on to give something in-
teresting. This meeting will be held in the
open air if the weather permits. Special
music will be afforded.

Bob Miles graduated with the Davidson |
|class of 1909. While here he was a campus
‘leader, being very prominent in athletics.
| For the two years following the war, he was
‘at Davidson in the capacity of Y. M. C. A.
|secretary. It was he who made the “Y” what
| it is today. Since he was here, Davidson has
| never been without a “Y” secretary. During

his two years here he acted as coach of bas-
ketball, turning out two very successful
teams. He was a gengral favorite among the
| students. One year the principal of the local
| high school became sick and was unable to
| finish out the year. Bob acted as principal
| for the remainder of the year, besides car-
| rying on his work as Y. M. C. A. secretary.
| Thus he became endeared to the people of
| the town as well as the students.

| For several years he was located at Auburn
!as pastor for the Alabama Polytechnic In-
| stitute. Last September he became the Gen-
jeral Assembly Evangelist, an office recently
|created by the Presbyterian Church. His
| work is primarily among college men. He
