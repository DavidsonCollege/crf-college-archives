Davidson horseback riding :
successful thanks to dedication

By TAINE ALISON
Asst. Features Editor

Hard work, determination
and lots of luck. . .that is how
the Davidson College Horse-
back Riding Program has be-
come more than just a far-
fetched dream.

It all began last year when
Mr. J.W. Howard of Atlanta
offered Davidson the use of his
property to begin a riding
program. He generously do-
nated the resources and the
capital necessary to get the
program off the ground. Mr.
Howard’s continued support a-
long with the dedication of
Sterling Martin, Director of
Physical Education, allowed
students to organize an instruc-
tional program last spring.

Under the leadership of Kath-

. erine Whitney, ’79 and Kathy
Woodward, ’79, students man-
aged to teach lessons, keep the
horses fed-and stalls clean.
Virginia Dummit, ’80, stayed in
Davidson over the summer,
teaching community children
and managing the barn.

Fall term, the college agreed
to hire Ms. Kathleen Case as a
part time employee to relieve
students of barn management
duties. ‘The program is opera-
ting on a three-year trial basis,
assuming that it is a self-sup-
porting program,’’ Sterling
Martin explained.

The barn manager’s salary as
well as all other operating costs
are generated from class fées,
contributions and the sale of
donated horses which the pro-
gram is unable to.use. In the
event that the program does not
make enough money to pay

~ Case, the College will guarantee

her salary, Martin said.

This year, Case has worked in
conjunction with a Student
Board to’ expand and improve
riding opportunities at David-
son. Rosie Whitesides, ’81,
Chairman of the Student Board,
defined the purpose of the
riding program: ‘‘The riding
program gives Davidson stu-
dents a unique opportunity to
have instruction in horseback
riding. It allows experienced
riders to share their knowledge
in a directed program. Weekend
activities such as trail rides also
provide opportunities for re-
creational riding.”

Fulfilling this purpose is far
from easy. Whitesides com-
ments: ‘‘We need time to get
details ironed out and to learn
more about how to run a riding
program.” She adds, “I think
we've made progress.”’

Since classes began last
spring, about 80 Davidson stu-
dents have been involved in the
program. At present there are
six studént instructors who
teach 8 classes of Davidson
students each week. There are -
also 4 classes per week of
community children. In addi-
tion, there is an instructor's
class of 4 students who are
preparing to teach next year.

Students pay $40.00‘per term
for 1 hour of instruction. each
“Week. On Saturdays: they can

This term the riding program
is also organizing weekend trail
rides, cookouts and overnight
rides for any interested stu-
dent—you do not have to take
lessons to be eligible to parti-
cipate in these recreational acti-
vities.

The response to the riding
program has been very positive.
Students from all skill levels
have expressed many reasons
why they enjoy riding at David-
son.

Belle Erdman, ’80, commen-
ted, ‘I enjoy teaching people
what I’ve had the opportunity
to learn before.’’ Teaching is not
a light responsibility, she no-
ted. “You've got to be dedi-
cated to work for the program.
You can’t let the Davidson
workload break that commit-
ment. Riding means enough to
me to make the work worth-
while.”

A member of the Advanced
class, Cordelia Crampton, '82,
said, “I enjoy riding at David-
son because I can continue

something I’ve done all my life,

and riding is a painless way of
getting a P.E. credit—except
when Kathleen (Case) is at the
other end of the lunge line!”
Ann Williams, ’82, is another
student who had riding experi-
ence before Davidson. She went

.through the instructor’s class

and is now teaching. ‘‘The
instructor’s class was rough
during the winter but it was
worth it to get out to the stables
because I had missed riding.”
She enjoys teaching her Ad-

vanced Beginners class because
‘the students are so enthu-

siastic. I just love it.”’

When asked what he likes
about riding, Jeff McArn, ’'79,
answered “Getting your hands
dirty...riding is something dif-
ferent, a good break from the
Davidson routine.”’ Virginia
Dummit, '80, expressed similar
feelings: ‘‘It’s good to get
totally away from campus. You
can forget all your social and
academic problems.’’ Dummit
currently teaches a class of
children ranging in age from 5th
grade to 16 years. ‘It’s fun to
get children and horses together
and enjoy their excitement.”

Although the riding program
‘has made encouraging progress,
there are still many. unsolved
problems. ‘‘When there is so
much money going to other
sports with less student partici-
pation, it is frustrating to have
to struggle for money just to
keep the horses fed,” commen-
ted Virginia Dummit.

Nevertheless, the students
involved, as- well us Kathleen
Case and Sterling Martin, are
hoping that with a little more
hard work, determination and
luck, the dreams of a Davidson
College Horseback Riding Pro-
gram will become a reality.

Football ends
Spring Practice
with Black team
vs. White team

intersquad game

By ROB GILLISON
Assistant Sports Editor

The Davidson Wildcat Foot-
ball team finished up their
spring football practice with an
intersquad game played last
Friday. The game pitted the
black against the white, with
the black team winning 17-7.

In the past the game had
been offense vs. defense but this
year the seam possesses enough
depth to fill two squads.

“We tried to split the team
evenly,” said Coach Ed Far-

- yell.” As a result we didn’t have

a real efficient game.” Farrell
did point out the outstanding
efforts of defensive tackle Mike

’ Sheridan and running back Ray
Sinclair, who-rushed for over

hundred yards.

“I want to finish the spring
on a high note,” said Farrell, ‘‘I
wanted good spirit and lots of
contact, and from that view-
point it was a successful exer-
