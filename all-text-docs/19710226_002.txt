The Ravidsantar

Faculty To Consider EPC
Proposal For Art Major

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor
The faculty at their meet-
ing Tuesday will consider a
proposal that will allow the
Fine Arts Department to of-
fer a major in art, accord-
ing to College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.
(Passed by the Educational
Policy Committee, the ma-
jor in art will include 36
hours with emphasis in stu-
dio and history as well as
extended studies three and
four.

“At present Davidson Col-
lege is a liberal arts college
without the arts,’’ said W.
Herbert Jackson, instructor
in art. ‘‘The world of the

visual arts has’ been ignor- |

ed.”

‘The purpose in offering a
‘major in art is not to turn
out artists, but to offer stu-

dents here an opportunity |

to open their eyes to -their.
surroundings and participate
in a non-verbal experience,”’
he said.

Jackson noted that the ma-
jor in art will be philosophi-

cally based: on the idea that
the student does not need
previous experience.

‘We will evalua each
work not on its objective
quality but on the involve:
ment of the student - his
trying and struggling to
complete the work,” said
Jackson.

Concerning the prospects
for the proposed major in
art, Jackson said that if the
faculty passes -it, ‘many
people will be surprised at
the number of people who
have been waiting in the

.wings.”’

Jackson said that there
will propably only be a few
students majoring in art the
first number of years; how-

and it was defeated. If this
matter came before the fa-
culty now, Epes believes it
would probably lose again.

“I don't know what would
cause the faculty to change
its mind, but self-righteous
pronouncements by the RHC
will not do it.’’ Epes sug-
gested the RHC bring the
issue before the Student Life
Committee, and he feels
that all parties concerned
will not get exactly whats
they want.

ever, he indiGated that the
number would probably in-
crease as the momentum of
the department increases.

There will be no major
outlay of funds in the near
future, according to Jack-
son. “We do not intend to
increase our budget more
that anyone else,’’ he said.

The number of course of-
ferings, however, will be in-
creased. Two additional
courses will be introuced in
studio, and the history
courses will be expanded.

The department will  in-
clude three professors: Jack-
son, Douglas C. Houchens,
associate professor of Fine
Arts, and Larry L; Ligo, in-
structor in Art.

Samuel Spencer Jr. and
Vice-president of Finances
and Development C. David
Cornell have agreed to hold
an Open End on coeduca-
tion at the beginning of the
Spring term.

The Open End “will be

held shortly before the joint
meeting of the Davidson and
Queens coeducation commit-

» tees.

Clodfelter announced that
he would write a letter to
each of the faculty commit-
‘ee chairmen urging them to
ask Spencer to approve stu-
dent members for their com-
mittees.

Spencer has stated that he
would let students. serve on
the faculty committees if the
committee chairmen ask for
student meribership.

In response’ .to criticism
from the SGA on his letter
on Rennie Davis, Spencer
wrote Clodfelter to explain
that he had writtem the poli-
cy statement to explain to
the alumni why he would not
overrule the SGA’s action
in inviting Davis.

Spencer wrote that the
statement was written be-
cause several alumni felt
that Davis’ presence on cam-
pus would’ be an affirmation
of what Davis advocates.

Only one’ alumni asked to
have Davis banned outright
from the campus, Spencer
added.

The Trustee Committee on
Campus Governance, Clod-
felter told the SGA, is in the
process of redoing the honor
code and the honor court in
order to bring them more

in line with English common
law. ey

Since the committee does
not feel that it has the«time
to hear from the students,
Walter L. Lingle, president
of the trustees, requested
that any views held by stu-
dents be dropped off at
Spencer's office to be. for-
warded to him.

If Peter Hobbie, assistant
to Dr. Spencer, could not
succeed in giving each trus-
tee a copy of the book by
Earl McGarth, “Should the

Student Share the Power?,”
then the SGA ought to look
into the possibility of giving
the trustees the book~ with
SGA founds, Junior Jody
Turner. suggested.

To* improve relations be-
tween the SGA and the: ad-
ministration, Spencer, © Cor-

nell, and Vice-president for ~

Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan offered to meet with
the SGA to answer any ques-
tions, Clodfelter announced.

Junior Cecil’ Burney was
opposed to the idea. ‘‘This’ll
give Spencer the chance tq)
go to the trustees and say,
‘Look and see what good stu-
dent-administration relations
we have here.’ ”’

Over Burney’s objections,
the senate’ passed a motion
by Junior Jody Turner ask-
ing Spencer to come to the
second meeting of every
month.

Clodfelter also announced
that he had a list of over
60 symposia»that Davidson
students would be eligible to
attend. Although no money

SGA To Sponsor Coed Discussion

ly, the SGA would tisten to
requests for funds, Clodfelter
added.

The majority of the meet-
ing was spent, however, on a
motion by Doug Sittler which
Stated that all student mem-
bers of faculty committees
be required to report to the
SGA every two weeks or be
impeached,

Sittler felt that the mo-
tion was needed because
‘otherwise, the student would
have more loyalty to the
committee than to the SGA.
This is one chance for the
SGA to assert itself.”

After changing the word:
“impeached” to “reviewed,”
the motion was passed.

Freshman President Bill
Ralston capped: off the meet-
ing by saying that he had
talked to Dean Burts about
the locking up of all-night
study rooms.

“Dean Burts told me that
he had not yet reached a de-
cision on the matter and that
he was_ still considering
whether to have them or
not,’’ Ralston stated.

ROTC Students To Visit

High schools in the lower
Piedmont of North Carolina
will be visited soon by Da-
vidson ROTC students striv-
ing to meet guidance coun-
selors and high school sen-
iors in an effort to tell. them
something about ROTC.

The program, part of a
nationwide, federally-funded
project, involves Davidson
with 93 secondary schools in
the general area.

It is designed to acquaint
people in a geographical
area with the principles, ob-
jectives, and advantages of
ROTC to allow the individual
student the opportunity ‘to
make a reasonable decision
whether or not to enroll in
military service courses in
college.

The program will also in-
form students in these high
schools .of ROTC scholar-
ships, which they‘ may be

eligible for but not aware
of.

Col. Virgil Foster,. who
commands Davidson's ROTC
Corps, said he felt the pro-
gram had two definite ad-
vantages.

First, he felt that through
such a program prospective
ROTC enrollees know what
the program involves. and
what they are getting into if
they decide to enter ROTC.

Foster also said that the
program could well serve to
advertise Davidson College
to students who may not

_ have been approached by

the college previously. ~<
