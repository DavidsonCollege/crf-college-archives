-Zionism t

To the Editor:

‘‘The Palestine problem is the
problem which has arisen from the
fulfillment of the Zionist ambition to
create a Jewish state in Palestine at
the cost of the forcible displacement
of the original inhabitants and the
usurpation~ oftheir national home-
land. It should be remarked at the
outset that the Palestine problem
does not involve a conflect between
the Arabs, be they Muslims or
Christians, and Judaism, for Arabs
and Jews have lived throughout
centuries in peace and harmony. The
conflict is between the Arabs and
Zionism, which from a humanitarian
concept seeking a place of refuge for
persecuted Jewry, has evolved into
what some consider, to be as racist,
nationalist and imperialist move-
ment."’ (Henry Cattan, The Middle
East: A Handbook).

I think it 1s common for one in this
country, because of the information
which one receives. to regard Zionism
as as movement with the empathy-
evolving goal of providing the iong
and terribly persecuted people of the
dewish faith with a homeland where.
they can live their lives in peaee, free
‘from Che hardships and fears imposed
upon them wherever they roam. If
this were true, there could be no more
noble and peace pursuing movement
in the history of mankind. However,
to the contrary, since the establish-
ment of Zionist forces in the Middle:
East, there has been nothing but
bloodshed and violence, climaxing in
four major Arab-Israeli wars -- in
in 1948, 1967, and 1973. It is hard for _
me to imagine all this hostility and
conflict resulting from simply esta-
blishing a place of refuge for a perse-
cuted people. Therefore I feel it is of
utmost importance to come to an
understanding of what Zionism really
is.
~~ Three main aspects of Zionism
which need to be sharply differenti-
ated from each other are Religion,
Economic and Political Zionism.

Religious Zionism is an integral
part of the orthodox Jewish faith, and
has to do with Jehovah gathering his
people from the ends of the earth and
reestablishing both the ancient Jew-
ish priesthood and the Jewish king-
dom. It is, however, a fulfillment of
divine prophesy by the hand of God
and hardly capable of being transla-
ted into an active political movement.

Economic Zionism can be described
as the effort on the part of the Jews in
the late 19th century to ‘‘secure a
home in some soil where they might
live safely and develop freely’’ with-
out the rpessure of the sinister and
despotic governments of Russia and
Rumania, which used the Jews as
scapegoats and subjected them to all
forms of persecution and oppression.
It was natural and not accidental that
the Zionist movement took its rise in
Russia, starting in 1881 with Dr. Leo
Pinsker's call to ‘‘Self-Emancipa-
tion.”” At first this emancipation of
the Jews took the form of mass
immigration out of Russia and Ruma-
nia and the establishing of colonies
mainly in North and South America,
but also a few in Palestine. The
immigration movement into Palestine
was then thought of as perhaps even a
good thing for the region, for many
thought that the economic conditions
of Palestine would improve with ‘the
influx of energetic and enthusiastic
groups."” ;

“ Seerentirety new diractinr, How-
ever, was given to the Zionist

movement through the introduction
of the political factor. This was the
work of the late Dr. Theodore Herzl,
who may be regarded as the founder
of political Zionism, which, quite
distinct from the religious and econo-
mic phases, has as its ultimate aim
the conversion of PaléStine into a
Jewish State. Since the first Zionistic
Congress held at Basel in 1897,
therefore, the political note has been
the dominant one in the Zionist
movement, attaching itself fo both
the religious and the economic aspects
in such a way as to secure a far more

import than the desirer...of the one to

that ancient land.”

The Ballfour declaration paved the
way for massive Jewish immigration
into Palestine, promoted and financed
by Zionist organizations with one
political objective: the ereation of a
demographic nucleus which would

general cooperation for the ultimate-
aim of political Zionism. As early as
1919, political Zionism, distinet from
Religious and Reonomie Zionism, had
been described as Involving ‘not only
difficulties. as the Zionists them.
selves recognize, but also dangers
which in the opinion of non- Zionists
are sufficiently serious to condemn
the entire movement as unfortunate.
and as threatening to peace through-
out the world.’’’ (Morris Jastrow,
Zionism and thé Future of Palestine;
the Fallacies and Dangers of Political.
Zionism.)

With 1919 also came the birth of
the Ballfour declaration, which has
been described as a document in
which ‘‘one nation solemnly promised
to a second nation the country of a
third.”’ It was made in complete
disregard of the rights and wishes of
the inhabitants of the country, in-
cluding those of the Jews of Palestine,
who also disapproved of the Zionist
plan of a Jewish controlled state. On
August 11, 1918, Arthur James
Ballfour himself wrote, ‘‘In Palestine
we do not propose even to go through
the form of consulting the wishes of
the present inhabitants of that count-

soon. If not, the primary concern of
the Academic Vice-President will not
be faculty evaluation, but finding
faculty members who will stay at
Davidson long enough to- even be
evaluated.

Any process in which a group of
people must evaluate a peer is
necessarily delicate and no perfect
system will ever by devised. Indeed, a
brief perusal of other college news-
papers shows that even at schools
with more clearly defined evaluation
procedures, controversies over re-
newal decision still occur. The imple-
mentation of a more cogent process
at Davidson will not forever eliminate
cries of “Foul!”, but it would at least
enable us to know the rules of the
game.

This is, in my opinion. a perfect
example of the pro-political Zionist
inffuence in Lhe mass media of our
country: for how many have ever
