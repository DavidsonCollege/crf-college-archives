Hears Dr. Sevier

Ministerial Band Hears Dr. Sevier

Dr. Joseph R. Sevier, president of the
Fassifern School at Hendersonville, ad-
dressed the Ministerial Band in Shearer
hall last Sunday. Mr. Johnson intro-
duced the speaker.

The topic of Dr. Sevier’s talk was:
“The Measure of a Man.” His scripture
reading was taken from Rev. 21-17. He
pointed out that man is not measured by
the linear system or. by money standards.
The ministerial candidate must top the
scales of manhood far greater than
other men. His standard should be un-
selfishness, vision, and high ideals.

The band will have the installation of
officers next Sunday. The following of-
ficers were elected: A. B. Williford, pres-
ident; D. H. Stewart, vice-president; L.
K. Pritchett, secretary. The same treas-
ured, Joe Garrison, will continue in office
until the end of the year. The old of-
ficers were: Bowie, Goodykoontz, and
Murchison.

Because a large number of the band
were in Mooresville, the attendance was
not up to the average. About twenty of
the boys went to Mooresville to hold a
religious census of the town, This was
done at the request of the pastor of the
Second Presbyterian Church of Moores-
ville.

| R. O. T. C. News

The student body of Davidson College
is greatly indebted to Sergeants Kirby
and Brittain for their tireless work at
the football games that have been on
the hill. These men have supervised the
ushering and guarding at all the games,
an dthe R. O. T. C. Department has co-
operated with the Athletic Association
in every way possible. Sergeant Kirby
has personally supervised the direction
of all the traffic, and is responsible for
the fine way in which it has been handled.
These men have worked out of their
own free will, without any recompense,
and the students of the college owe them
a vote of thanks.

The Davidson College Rifle Team has
always been fair, but has never before
been excellent. This year prospects look
very encouraging, and under the direc-
tion of Captain Daugherty a winning
team is confidently expected. The stu-
dents who make the rifle team have been
giving it a lot of extra time and hard
work. At N. C. State College the mem-
bers of the rifle team get the same rec-
ognition as in other minor sports. Here
they get no- recognition whatsoever.
Should not the Davidson Athletic Asso-
ciation adopt a policy of giving the rifle
team some form of recognition? If our
varsity rifle team comes out this year in
the first four of the southern colleges, |
surely they should have some form of |
athletic award or monogram.

Captain Weems, P. M. Sgt. has pur-
chased $50 worth of brass buttons, and
distributed them to the battalion. This ,

will make all the uniforms similar in
every detail, and will enable the bat- |
talion to make

a better showing in|
parades and reviews, |

The traveling repair man of the United
States Army has just inspected the equip-
ment of the local unit. His report was
very gratifying to the officials here. He
reports that the rifles and equipment |
were in better condition than any in
North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia.

The Military Department hopes very
much to get a distingijshed rating this
year. This of course is very difficult to
obtain, and would mean a lot to the col-
lege if it got it.

To get this rating, some college such
as Georgia Tech, Clemson, or Citadel,
would have to be displaced by Davidson.
Nevertheless, the battalion is looking very
good, and Captain Weems is confident
that our chances for obtaining distin-
guished rating are very good this year.

Formerly only one girl turned a man’s
head—now they all do.

Evidently the sidelines did also, as they
came to their fect with a cheer that resound-
ed throughout the village.

The stands were colorful with gay-hued
dress of men as well of women, The mili-
tary band led the assembled students in the
singing of “O! Davidson,” and yells and
cheers were hurled back from both sides of
the field. When the last whistle was blown,
every Davidson player was lifted to his feet
by admirers who flocked onto the field to
show their admiration for the little team
that has held its own with every foe met
on the football field this season.

Every man on the Red and Black team
played a valiant game. Hendrix, Wells and
Black, playing their last game, all added
their speed and might to the advancing of
the ball through the territory defended by
the heavy forwards of Duke. Little Dick
Grey twinkled his toes time after time to the
tune of the heavy thudding of the Blue
Devils’ feet which followed on his heels.
Arrowood, Baker and Vance more than did
their own work in the line. They were into
every play. For the Dukemen, Grigg,
Thompson, Culp and Finley were the out-
standing players.

Grey kicked off perfectly to within a yard
or two of the Methodists’ goal line. The
bal was returned only a few yards, and
when forced, the Blue Devils got off a short
punt. After one line plunge, Grey took the
ball on a trick pass and whirled it to Lucian
Wells, who was running at full speed. The
runner grabbed the ball out of mid-air and
thence over the line for a touchdown, Grey
kicked goal.

Both teams threatened during the re-
mainder of the first period, the Methodists
driving hard at times, the Wildcats having
to exert every bit of their strength to keep
the blue-jerseyed men from their territory.
Grey attempted a field goal from the 45-yard
line, but failed.

10 for the second touchdown of the game.
The try for goal was not successful. The
ball remained in the center of the field for a
while, neither side being able to get to the
other’s line.

The most sensational play of the game was
that of Grey when he grabbed the ball from
center and ran roughshod over the whole
opposition to the goal line, 30 yards away.
He had to crawl the last few feet, having
been knocked off his feet by a heavy tackle.

Black, captain of the Wildcats, drove the
ball over for a touchdown in the third quar-
ter, following a 65-yard advance up the field
from the kick-off. Neither team was able
to score or gain much ground in the final
period,

The Methodists missed the assistance of
Caldwell, their backfield star, but they played
a stiff game nevertheless. Davidson out-

played her opponents in every department of |

the game.

“Y” Sends Deputations
to Adjacent Localities

The Y. M. C. A. has, as usual, sent this
year several deputations to various points
in the state. The purpose, in general, of
these deputations is to bring before the
boys of the high schools and other or-
ganizations the right ideals concerning
the college man and college life, to let
them know the Christian college man’s
viewpoint of character building, right
living, and scholarship.

On October 30, Don Stuart attended an
Older Boys’ Conference at Shelby, N. C.
Next there were two deputations sent
from here, sponsored by Mr. Grady H.

Many a man has no peace of mind be-
cause his wife is constantly giving him a
piece of hers.
