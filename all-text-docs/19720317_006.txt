months was the final design

around the stores and three
large off-street parking lots.

National Art Show
Opening At Stowe

A PREVIEW
By FRANK SOOS
Staff Writer

Yes friends, Sunday in Stowe
Galleries you can finally get a
look at the show you've all been
waiting for—no doubt, you've
never heard of it, the Davidson
National Print and Drawing
Competition, It’s much more im-
portant than the NIT and it’s
happening right here on your
own Campus.

To offer some credibility for
you no-believers here are some
facts to satisfy any Davidson
man’s thirst for truth. The Da-
vidsca National is truly a na-
tional show, receiving entries
from 49 states (Hawaii didn’t
make it).

Over one thousand artists sub-
mitted 2,523 works for the initial

Meetze said that everyone in-
volved was optimistic about the
plan but were facing the reali-
ties of the situation. He describ-
ed the plan as a means to influ-
ence the quality of growth of
the town. He sees the plan as
developing and continuing a
unique community.

The plan was presented at an
open town meeting several
weeks ago and the town was
solidly behind it. Meetze pointed
out that this was a surprise,
since usually plans of this type
generate differing points of
view.

judging. That number makes
the Davidson National not only
the largest competition of this
year but also the largest com-
petition of its kind in recent
years.

Each entering artist was al-
lowed to enter as many as two
prints or drawings for the judg-
ing. From these our noble juror
had the not too envious task of
picking the very best of them.

Fearless Frank Getlein, critic
and columnist for the ‘‘Washing-
ton Star,” waded into the crowd.
ed Stowe Galleries with a criti-
cal eye, a strong heart and a
foul mouth to judge. After three
days, he emerged, a veritable
John Wayne come home from
fight:ng the Indians.

He selected 127 pieces of great
(as well as) representative, art
to make the Davidson National
Show.

You'll see just about any type
of art being made these days
within the realm of printing and
drawing. Works range from the
abstract to the surreal to the
real. Media range from pencil
and paper to the most complex
multiple plate printing.

Sunday, March 19, marks the
show’s opening. The reception
will be from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.
ami is open to the college com-
munity. However, the show will
be on display until April 29 for
your artful edification.

Getlein also judged the Pied-
mont University Center Student
art exhibit while passing through
the area with his all-seeing eye.
Of the 20 eligible colleges in the
Piedmont region, Davidson was
the standout.
