Lacrosse tops Mt. St. Mary’ Ss, pushes win streak to three

By Wit BrapsHAw

The women’s lacrosse team hit
the road this weekend, but the result
was the same. Mount St. Mary’s
was no match for the streaking Wild-
cats, who won their third straight

and seventh in the last eight.
“We played in spurts,” coach
Mary Schwartz
said. “It was an
up and down
game for
us.We didn’t play a full 60 min-
utes.”

Despite the spotty play, the
team opened a five-goal lead at the
half, and coasted through the sec-
ond half for the win. Goalkeeper
Lisa Benjamin was a veritable wall,
stopping 18 shots to help the Wild-
cats (7-4) to victory.

Allison Rhoads’ six goal per-

formance highlighted the Wildcat
offense, and Linda Rothemund
played table-setter, collecting five
assists.

“Those two (Rothemund and
Rhoads) were working with each
other really well,” Schwartz said.

Sarah Hogan and Amanda
Fleck each had three goals to round
out the offensive punch.

“Tt was a sloppy field, and we
looked a little tired at times,”

Schwartz said. “We had moments

of good play where we scored some
nice goals, and then we fell apart a
little bit. All in all, we outplayed
them and definitely were the better
team.”

They played at University of
Maryland-Baltimore County late
Sunday, and face off with Rich-
mond (Wednesday), Mercyhurst
(Saturday), and Ohio State (Sun-
day) later this week.

Anna Judy
Allison Rhoads, shown here scoring against Cornell, scored six goals in the Wildcats’ win Saturday.

Fantastic finish bodes well for next year’s squad

the Year honors for the first time
since 1993.

“Anytime you get that award,”
Frank said, “It means your kids are
playing great.”

Frank attributes that greatness
to his top player, Jon Pastel.

“He’s got the heart of a lion,
and the team sees that,” Frank said.
“He’s the one that gets the team
focused. I can’t do that. He de-
mands it of them.

“I won’t ever see another guy
like Jon Pastel in my coaching ca-
reer. Of course, I’ve got him for
another year, and I like that.”

In fact, almost all of this year’s
team will be back next season. Derek
Schulze is the only player set to
graduate.

He finished his Davidson ca-
reer with a 6-2, 6-2 win over An-
eh Ghseg of ne State fora third:

place finish in the fourth singles
flight.

Thatmeans the Wildcats should
be favored to win the league cham-
pionship behind the leadership of
Pastel and the dominance of their
doubles teams, all three of which
will return fully intact.

However, next year’s tourna-
ment will change from its flighted
format to dual competition, and the
winner will receive an automatic
bid into the NCAA tournament
draw.

These changes, combined with
the quest forrevenge after this year’s
heartbreaking finish, could make
next year even better for the Wild-
cats.

“We’re going to be in great
shape next year,” Pastel said.

“This is the most incredible
team I’ veevercoached,” said Frank.

“They just fight and they don’t give
up a ching ;

Sailing shocks competition, miraculous
run ends four points short of Nationals

By WILL BEASLEY
Staff Writer

The sailing team concluded its
eye-opening season on April 2 by
placing second in the North District
and fourth out of 23 schools in the
South Atlantic Conference cham-
pionships.

A late run left the Wildcats just
short of nationals, but that didn’t
dampen their accomplishments.

In earlier qualifying regattas,
the College of Charleston — cur-
rently ranked second in the world
— took first in the North.

But Davidson surpassed rivals
Vanderbilt, The Citadel, Duke, and
UNC-Wilmington to post a second
place finish, securing a bid to the
1997 Spring Championships.

Atthe tourney, held in Charles-
ton, S.C., the host Cougars again
won easily, and Davidson, Florida,
and Eckerd engaged in a dog fight
for the silver medal and an auto-
matic invitation to Nationals.

After trailing in the morning

races, over-achievers Brice Ivy,
Graham Ernst, Lindsay O’ Nell, and
Will Beasley put forth a surge in the
sixth and seventh rotation to re-
cover ten points off of second.

But ultimately, the Wildcats
were unable to sustain their mo-
mentum, and fell to both Florida
and Eckerd.

Despite the tease of what would
have been an unexpected bid to
nationals, Ernst was still content

- with the result.

“T’m just proud of the effort
and impressive performance the
team squeezed out under pressure,”
said the senior. “Especially consid-
ering we were the only non-varsity
team of the top six.

“Tt’s scary to consider the po-
tential success we might have had
with a respectable amount of ad-
ministrative support. At least we
had fun.”

The performance was a disap-
pointing finish to what was one of
the best seasons in years.

Furman captured the title by
edging perennial league power East
Tennessee St. on the second hole of
a sudden-death playoff.

The Paladins and Bucs, who
have combined to win the last 10
conference crowns and 18 of 19,
tied in regulation play, each with a
score of 931.

“We did not have a very good
overall tournament,” said coach Joe
Mark. “But, all things considered,
this team performed very well for
the entire 1996-97 season.”

Especially Jason Carlock, who
finished fifth individually at Stoney
Creek and earned one of the five
coveted spots on the all-conference
team, becoming the first Wildcat to
do so since Sollie Foy in 1979.

The senior co-captain, who
averaged a 75 over 21 competitive
rounds this year, posted a 78-73-
71=232, finishing ten strokes be-
hind tourney winner Jordan Byrd of
Furman.

The other four Wildcat golfers
placed within four strokes of each
other.

David Alexander logged a to-
tal of 248, Jason Lina and Daniel
Tedrick both finished at 249, and
Conner Eldridge at 252.

“We will be looking forward to
next year,” said Mark. “Hopefully
the team will improve as much as
this one did over the nreviane vear ”
