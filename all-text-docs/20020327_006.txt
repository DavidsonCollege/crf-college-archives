Her study includes travel through Northern
and Southern Europe, Asia, the Near East,
and the Pacific.

Dillard says she chose this project because
“T think physical beauty is something many
people struggle to accept.
Why does America have
such a high rate of anor-
exia and bulimia? Though
there is not one answer, I -
would like to perhaps find
some causes and maybe
one day, Ill be able to
help someone,” she ex-

‘plains.

“Simply winning means
that I must have been do-
ing something right while
here at Davidson,” she
said. “It also means a
chance to be an explorer-
not only because I’m go-
ing to many places, but
because I will be explor-
ing people’s hearts and
minds. A lot of my project
involves meeting and talk-
ing to people. I’m always
excited about meeting
someone new.”

Dillard credits Davidson for the role it
played in assisting her in her accomplish-
ment. “Davidson played a huge role. If [had
not been encouraged by the likes of Mrs.
Ortmayer in Study Abroad, Dr. Fox, Dean
Ernest Jeffries and many others, I may have
never traveled abroad during the summer of
2000. That one trip led me to go.abroad two

to be a traveler. That, in turn, was one reason
I applied for the Fellowship.”

“Essentially, I want to learn how people

explained Hartman. “Is there a requisite
framework that one must have in order to

Hollis, a political science major from Ham-
burg, N.Y., designed a project studying the
“new types of species preservation programs
for sea turtles and how they affect the rela-
tionships between the sea turtles and coastal
communities.”

“T created this project
because it blends a lot of
my interest together. I’m
interested in species pres-
ervation programs, com-
munity dynamics and how
people interact with endan-
gered species. I find sea

‘- turtles fascinating and I
really enjoy tropical

beaches.”

“IT heard about the
Watson my sophomore
year in Dr. Chasten’s
microeconomic class,”
said Hollis. “It seemed like such a great op-
portunity. I knew then I wanted to do some-
thing and had a few ideas; but, it wasn’t until
I spent some time in Thailand that I made the
mental connections between my interests and
this particular project started coming to-
gether.”

plained, is that “it gives me the chance to

devote time to a topic I find personally inter-
esting. The Fellowship also allows me to
spend an extended period of time in places I
might not otherwise get to.”

The best part of winning the award, he said,
was “discovering that all four of us had won.”

The final recipient of the Fellowship is
Adam Norris, an economics major form
McConnelsville, Ohio. He plans to study the
“differences in rural health care delivery in
Switzerland, New Zealand, Palau, and Costa
Rica.”

“Over the last year I have been planning a
journey that would take me to some of the
world’s finest health care systems to nations
that struggle, and are overcoming, some of
the health care problems that this nation faces,”
Norris explained.

“My interest in health care began while at
Davidson with Professor Kelly Chaston of
the Economics Department who helped to
develop and enrich my passion for the topic in
classes and research.”

College president Bobby Vagt was de-
lighted with Davidson’s “grand slam” of four
winners. “I think it is an accurate and won-
derful reflection of the quality of the students
here,” he said, adding that the Watson Foun-
dation director included a personal note con-
gratulating Davidson on its students’ achieve-
ments.

The Thomas J. Watson Foundation was
established by Mrs. Thomas J. Watson. in
1961 as a charitable trust in memory of her

‘ husband. In 1968 the Watson children de-

cided to expand the Watson Fellowship as the

totaling around $23 million. The foundation
selects annual winners from nominees sub-
mitted by 50 select institutions.
