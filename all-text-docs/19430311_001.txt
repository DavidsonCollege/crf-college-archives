Meets Students

Several different groups have met
with Dr. Mauze since his arrival
here. On Wednesday night, he at-
tended the regular Y.M.C.A. Cab-
inet meeting and he spoke to the
ministerial students. He also met
with the hall prayer group leaders
and attended one of the prayer
groups on Wednesday night. Many
of the students met with Dr. Mauze
in private conferences, during the
first two days and those who have
not done so and still wish to talk
with him may do so by arranging
a conference through Shaw Smith at
the Y.M.C.A.

As a student at Davidson in the
class of 1923 Dr. Mauze was a star
member of the basketball team,
playing on the varsity for two
years: His junior year he was all-
state center and in his Senior year
he was captain of the team. Bas-

—ketball—-was not his” only sport,
however. He was a mainstay on the
football team and a regular on the
Wildcat nine. Along with his ath-
letic ability, Dr. Mauze was Secre-
tary of the Student Body, a mem-
ber of the Bachelors Club, and a
First Lieutenant in R.O.T.C.

Dr. Mauze’s original home-was in
Huntington, W. Va. At present he
is pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church at Winston-Salem. He suc-
ceeded Dr. Cunningham in that po-
sition when Dr. Cunningham came
to Davidson as president.

Unstable Conditions

Because of the unstable conditions
this year it has been impossible to
schedule the four regular sets usu-
ally held at Davidson. For the same
reason. the councilhas— not been
able to make plans as far-in ad~-
vance as has been customary. Al-
though many men in the Enlisted
Reserve Corps may be called from
school before that week-end, the
council is planning definitely to go
ahead with the dances and asks the
