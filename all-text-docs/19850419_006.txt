Elvis Re-releases Go Back To True Rock And Roll

By MATT MORRIS

-Musically speaking, 1985 will
be remembered as the year of the
reissue. So far we’ve had 12 in-
credible tracks of North Carolina
rock on Steve Berger’s compila-
tion album Tobacco-A-Go-Go,
four Velvet Underground records
including the great Lost Velvet’s
LP, VV, and now RCA has kindly
brought three of Elvis’ early LPs
back into existence to celebrate
the “King’s” 50th birthday. And
what an event it is... Each
album captured the “true” Elvis
sound, pre-1960, pre-army, pre-
Hollywood, pre-Christian; in
other words pure rock ’n’ roll,
done the way only a true “king”
could.

The earliest reissue, Elvis Pre-
sley, dating from '956 contains
simply some of the best Western
music there is. “Money Honey”
jams with Elvis pushing his vocal
cords (and we can imagine, his
thighs) to an animalistic limit. No
one can slink through Blue Suede
Shoes better than Elvis—not even
Carl Perkins version can capture
Elvis’ effortless, utterly simple,
powerfully honest approach. With
a basic backing of bass, guitar,
drums and of course Elvis, great
music erupts from this LP. No
matter what mood you're in Elvis
Presley will seize your emotions.
With the sexually potent, hypno-
tic sound of Elvis bellowing

through the speakers as if from
some deep dark 1956 well, “I'll
Never Let You Go” another out-
Standing cut on this masterly LP,
seems almost psychedelic; dream-
like rock that makes you sway in
your shoes and in your head.

This first LP would be tough
for anyone to beat (the Clash tried
to mimic its power if only through
a cover imitation) but Elvis’ sec-
ond LP Elvis 1958, while not the
completely flawless experience
that Elvis Presley is, contains sev-

eral memorable tunes.
“Paralyzed,” a rocker of the first
degree, will leave you gasping.
With the simple “boy/girl oh, why
don’t you like me,” etc. glide,
Elvis creates a sound that rocks
and rolls, all in an unpretentious

way. Elvis probably didn’t even
know what he was doing himself,
but non-self-consciousness makes
for great.art and that’s what Elvis’
music (from this period anyway)
is.

Of course there’s an occa-
sional bug in every stew and Elvis
1958 is no exception/“When My
Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again”
wallows in Elvis’ bellowing and
hints at his later blunted sound.
But hey, Elvis 1958 gives you a
real goody worth the price of ad-
mission. The king’s first record-
ing ever, “Old Shep,” is a funny,
touchng tale in the “Old Yeller”
tradition where, in first person
Elvis relates to us the tragic tale of
the death of his true friend, his dog
Old Shep. On some strange level
(don’t ask me how) Elvis makes
me get a little teary-eyed when he
sings “If dogs have a heaven/Then
I know/Old Shep has a wonderful
home.”

Golden Hits, a great greatest
collection contains all the golden
oldies like ‘Hound Dog.” “All
Shook Up” “Heartbreak Hotel,”
“Jailhouse Rock” and the haunt-
ing “Love Me Tender” that really
raked in the bucks, and the truly
deserved all their rich rewards. If
you've every been a skeptic to-
wards Elvis and his explosive tal-
ent check out these LPs—blast
from the 50s—and see what you
think. Oh, and be sure to thank the
guys at RCA as you leave.
