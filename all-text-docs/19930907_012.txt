Southern man Young's music suits his image

Neil continued from page 10

Blind Melon and the Connells
were the two opening acts. Unfor-
tunately, I missed Blind Melon al-
though I heard they only played for
thirty minutes. The Connells
played second, but I just caught the
tailendof their performance. Never
mind that. Icamtosee Neil Young,
and I caught every note.

Neil strode confidently onto
the stage, clad in a black t-shirt
with an eagle design, Levi’s and
work-boots. He was backed up by
Booker T and the M.G.’s, and al-
though I had read in Rolling Stone
that their presence gave the evening
a soulful feel, I didn’t think any-
thing really detracted from Neil’s
characteristic style. The back-up
band was very good; they repro-
duced his songs with great accu-
racy.

I was glad that the music was
harder than his most recent acous-
tic efforts, Harvest Moon and Un-
plugged. He opened with the hard-
hitting classic “Mr. Soul” and went
straight into an intense rendition of
“The Loner.”

The North Carolina crowd
went wild at the opening strains of
“Southern Man,” as Neil carefully
enunciated the lyrics: “Southern
man better keep your head/ Don’t

ON THE SCENE

forget what your good book said/
Southern change gonna come at

last/ Now your crosses are burnin’ .
fast.” He then moved over to the

keyboard where he quietly played
a staple from his Crosby, Stills &
Nash days, the emotive “Helpless.”
A disturbing “Like A Hurricane”
was next, then “Motorcycle
Mama,” asomewhat amusing track
from the Comes A Time album.
The next song was a depressing
tune about lost love that nobody
around meseemedtoknow. “Love
to Burn” from the Ragged Glory
CD followed this.

At this point, my friends and I
were yelling for Neil to play
“Powderfinger,” one of my favor-
ite songs. Apparently he was tak-
ing requests, because he strummed
a powerful chord on his guitar and
began the first lines: “Look out
mama, there’ l a white boat comin’
up the river.”

We were in heaven. He fairly

galloped across the stage as he
pounded out the melody on his
guitar. There seemed no end to
Neil’s boundless energy but the
audience needed a rest. The next
few songs were softer and more
subdued. “Only Love Can Break
Your Heart,” a peaceful “Harvest
Moon” and “Unknown Legend”
from the most recent CD were his

I was very impressed by “The
Needle and the Damage Done,”
his ironic account of a battle with
drugs. But by far the highlight of
the evening was the last song be-
fore the encore, the dark and upset-
ting “Down By the River,” another
favorite of mine. “Be on my side,
or be on your side,” the back-up
singers sang over and over as Neil
struck furious notes on his guitar,

For the encore, Young played
“Sittin’ On the Dock Of the Bay,”
backed up expertly by Booker T.
and the M.G.’s. He finished witha
forceful version of Bob Dylan’s
“All Along the Watchtower,”
which was very impressive.

After the two-song encore, he
left the stage for the last time. I
can’t even describe how happy I
was with the whole performance. I
definitely enjoyed being in the 7th
row, and felt like seeing him up
close was so much better than
watching him on a screen from the
lawn.

His lyrics are so sensitive and
direct and he is quite a skillful
guitarist. I was also amazed by his
boundless energy. He didn’t seem
to tire but continued to stomp
around the stage like a young man
of twenty.

I can’t think of any concrete
reasons why Neil Young should be
cast in The Bridges of Madison
County. It’s just a feeling. Like
Robert Kincaid, “his silver-grey
hair hung well below his ears and
nearly always looked disheveled,
as if he had just come in from a
long sea voyage through a stiff
wind and had tried to brush it into
place with his hands.”

Appearancesare insignificant -

to Neil, who has more important
things to think about than his looks.

Something about his careless, ~

weatherbeaten appearance sug-
gests that Neil has seen-a lot and
could tell you plenty: of stories.

You can see yourself sitting
on a porch with Neil as he skill-
fully whittles a birch bark canoe
with his Swiss Army Knife and
shares some pearls. of wisdom.
Unlike a lot of his contemporaries,
he made itthrough a near devastat-
ing spiral into drug addiction.

But he survived, and is still
writing innovative music and de-
livering during performances. It
wasn’t a has-been concert full of
old, recycled hits. Young’s per-
formance was full of intensity and
creativity, and a fierce indepen-
dence that comes through in every
song. I feel lucky to have seen him
live. And maybe he won’t get the
role as Robert Kincaid, but that’s
alright.

The real Robert Kincaid
wouldn’t have been in a movie
either.

Rodin sculpture hits

the visual arts center

Rodin continued from page 10

completing a clothed version. It is
for this reason that Jean d’ Aire has
such an unusual stance. His out-
stretched fists are clenched to hold
the bonds he carried in surrender-
ing himself to the English army.
These and other elements not di-
rectly related to the body itself,
including sackcloth clothing, were
added in the later six-figure monu-
ment. While the piece is a study, it
should by no means be considered
a mere sketch. It is a complete
work in and of itself.

Rodin’s Burghers of Calais
represents a major innovation in
the history of sculpture. Previ-
ously, monuments had been placed
on high pedestals as a way of en-
hancing the importance and status
ofthe subject matter. Rodin elimi-

- nated this high pedestal and asked

that his work appear in the com-
mon marketplace rather than in the
center of town, thus destroying the
physical and psychological: dis-

tance between the viewer and the
men whosaved the town of Calais.

Also of interest is the “7/8”
symbol found on the base of the
sculpture between the figure’s feet.
This mark tells us that the piece is
the seventh in a series of eight
exactly like the one here in
Davidson. Rodin made his sculp-
tures from molds, from which he
then authorized a certain number
of originals to be made. This fact
explains why one might see the
same sculpture in more than one
place. For example, another Jean
d’Aire piece stands in the Rodin
Museum in Paris.

Albert Elsen, a prominent art
historian and authority on the work
of Rodin, will be giving a public
lecture here at Davidson on Thurs-
day, November 4 for those who
would like to know more about
Rodin. Those who are art majors

‘ will be given the opportunity to

attend a seminar with Elsen which
will focus on theJean d’Aire pet
in particular.
