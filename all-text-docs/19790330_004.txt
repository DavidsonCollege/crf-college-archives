_ Give Them More

By the time a professor has been at Davidson long enough to be
up for tenure, he has invariably been able to make enough friends
> to be sure there'll be quite a stir if he doesn't get tenure. Because of
this. and the general problems that arise in evlauating people,
almost everyone who gets a job teaching here winds up with a

life-long contract.

The only realistic way to build an excellent faculty is to make
sure that the people who are originally offered teaching jobs at
Davidson are the best in their fields. The only way to insure this is
to offer them more money than other schools. Offering them less
money would evéntually destroy Davidson.

A suggestion for the Trustees: give the proffesors their requested

‘10 percent pd¥'raise.

To the Editor:

I have not written to the
' Davidson in the seven years I
have been back at Davidson,
but two different items in this
past week's paper really have
caused me concern.

The first was: the article by
the four professors. criticizing
Athletics at Davidson. I have a
great deal of respect for these
men ‘in their areas of expertise,
but react with absolute amaze-
ment at their naivete and
ignorance in athletic matters. I
could answer several of their
charges succintly: 1) The of-
- fending football players have
been dealt with individually as
should be the case (surely these
professors are not comdemning
the mass- for the actions of a
few). 2) The new famous Sports
Illustrated article alleged no

NCAA infractions and was

recognized to be totally inane
by all knowledgeable people. 3)
the result of the computer and
professors. on’ sabbatical this
Spring term. (Will these four
professors admit that if each
professor would teach three
hours a day instead of two, that
everyone could get every course
he wanted?( I ‘really don’t
advocate this, but it sure would

can you de-emphasize athletics
any more at Davidson? Only

' The rest of us (minor sports)

take what we can get, and do
the best we can. How can you

_ de-emphasize that?

But the item that bothered
me most was the casual refe-
rence in the editorial column
mentioning that, “Both (SGA
candidates for president) said
that they want to see Athletic
Director Thomas  Cartmill
fired.” There was no further
explanation of their. reasons,
-but agian I must ask ‘‘Where do
they get their information to
call for such a move?”’

There have been instances
where I have not agreed with
Mr. Cartmill, notably in the
area of budgets. But I know he
is working with an inadequate
budget for intercollegiate pro-
grams himself. This one thing
must be realized: the mah is an
ethical, moral, sincere man who
has the best interests of David-
son College and its students at
heart. A great many things he

‘is blamed for can be directly

attributed to lack of funds for
facilities or coaches. And this is
an area he has no direct control
over.

In all my dalings with him,
whether they be in the areas of
facilities, physical education, or

been consistent: the best inte-

The Campus Forum

Tradition Reborn,

To the Editor:

About two years ago I wrote
a letter to both the Update and
The Davidsonian questioning
whether the total demise of
Davidson was as eminent as the
happenings (at that time) so
suggested.

At that time the football and
basketball programs were about

- as low as they could get, but my

real concern was in the. area of
the academic shortcomings,
based on the college’s perfor-
mance in the state ‘‘College
Bow!” competition.

At that time Davidson had
finished either last or next to
last in competition with East
Carolina, UNC, and N.C. State.
My questions concerning the
academic capabilities and stan-
dards may have been somewhat

' premature, for as Mr. Lloyd so

ably pointed out, the competi-
tion was hot only based on
depth and breadth of know-
ledge, but also on quickness of
response. My only question to
this would be based on whether
or not he was saying that
Davidson students were not
quick thinkers.

As fate would have it, in the
two years. since I wrote that
letter I have moved around
quite a bit, but a ‘few months
ago returned to North Carolina

_ to live and work.

Inthe past few months I have

been able to observe a rebirth of

surface, bringing ona ray of
hope and expectation for the
future.

In regard to the academic
standards, I can honestly say
that it looks as though things
are on the up side also: In the
Charlotte Observer I see where
the Davidson College Bowl
team has had outstanding suc-
cess at the recent regional
competition in Knoxville, Ten-
nessee, placing first and better-
ing competitors from 10 other
colleges and universities, in-
cluding UNC, N.C. State, and
East Carolina, and winning a
trip to Miami for the National
Finals.

While I admit that athletics
and College Bow! activities are
but a small part of what
Davidson College has to offer
its students, success or failure
in these types of activities are

what the majority of the public —

hear and see, and are the things
that come to mind when they
think of Davidson College.
While those of us who have
ever attended Davidson recog-
nize the quality of the teachings
and research, the everyday
newspaper reader does not and
cannot relate to or appreciate
the percentages of medical or

‘law school acceptances of Da-

vidson students, nor can they

know of all the ptiblic service

activities both students and

faculty perform day in and day

out in the Davidson communi.

- ty, the Charlotte area, and even

- of maintaining outwardly what |
“ we ‘as--involved members
know—that: Davidson is an‘

ride, and it io one that dos

not succeed in bringing you to
your knees, and I hope that you
continue to uphold the tradi-
tions which we all want to see
carried on.
