Bulb-changer gets rich in Vegas

Along the Strip
By GRAND MASTER MELLE MEL

Joe Westinghouse, a neon-light changer
for the 96x59 foot spectacular in front of
Club Jackpot, plans to retire after winning
five million at keno last night here in Las
Vegas.

Reached at his suburban home today,
Westinghouse greeted reporters in his back-
yard. Asked what he was going to do with
all that money, he said, “I’m moving back
to my hometown, Davidson, N.C. The

people are great there. I got started light-
changing when I worked for Bubba Cash-
ion’s filling station as a hose-jockey. He al-
ways made me climb up into the Gulf sign
and change the lights. I owe it all to him.”

When he gets back to Davidson, he
plans to install a guitar-shaped swimming
pool, which will be Westinghouse’s first
purchase with his winnings. “I’ve always
wanted one of these things, but I wonder if
it will fit in my backyard. Oh well, Pll just

“This cash means I'll go on to every
gambler’s dream city, Monte Carlo,” Wes-
tinghouse said. He also revealed plans for
an extended pilgrimage to singer Elvis Pre-
sley’s home, Graceland. “Now that I’m a
star, I hope Pricilla will see me.”

What a guy!” added Westinghouse.
“Yeah, when I was a kid, I used to play
on Davidson’s campus. I used to tease all
the dogs .. .is Wompus still around?”
Asked if he knew any of the professors, he
replied, “I met that real old guy Chalmers.

“Davidson used to be a real bore. Now I
hear they have chicks and all. Moving back
is great. I ain’t never gonna change another
light bulb,” Westinghouse said.

Blonde \eaves the viewer hanging.

In another one of his never en-
ding attempts to keep Union atten-
dance at a peak this year, Rob
Vaughn has finally o.k.’d what
this reviewer considers to be the
finest of the Fine Film series. In
conjunction with the recently con-
ceived Human Sexuality Week,
the series convincingly promises
to raise Davidson's level of bare-
ness awareness.

Blonde, is a penetrating docud-
rama, exposing a radically new
position on the changing relation-
ships between modern man and
woman. The action is fast paced
and driving while the often emo-
tive dialogue virtually oozes with
passion. Love Auditorium cer-
tainly was this week.
Concerning character de-
velopment; Well . . . everyone’s

veloped. Lotta Fish, the film's
leading lady was perhaps the most
developed, a veritable Canon of
Proportion. (Boy, would Henry
Fonda have died for a few frames
with this one. If he hadn’t died,
that is.) Her leading man, John
Homely, did his part as well,
never disappointing the audience
let alone Lotta.

Kudos also ge to the lone

stretched himself in order to cap-
ture all the intricacies and undula-
tions in the action which make this
film so viewable. His superlative
job of panning (panting?) the
shots added immensely to the
storyline, not to mention the
soundtrack. How did he do it? ’'m
guessing lots of practice and lots
of hours in the darkroom.

One criticism; On Golden

I was never actually sure where
the climax occurred, or if it oc-
curred at all. Perhaps this was be-
cause the screen kept fogging up.

In any case, aside from all the
ups and downs and ins and outs,
On Golden Blonde gets a definite
thumbs up. And hey! Powers that
Be at the Union, thanks for daring
to be daring. We love ya and Lotta
loves ya!

Genocide cranks out tough neo- nazi rock

Heinrich Von Werner

It is rare that a rock band can
combine musical expertise, fanat-
ical followers, warped political
and social views, and sheer bad
taste into a frightening, yet excit-
ing success formula. Genocide, a
new international rock band has
done just that. A thinly veiled
facade for the religious neo-Nazi
revisionist organization N.F.J.,
Genocide is anything but apoliti-
cal. No two members are from the
same country, with lead singer
Henry Eichman hailing from the
American mid-west, bassist Jo-Jo
Geobels from W. Germany,
guitarist Benito Antonio -from

Italy, and drummer Jose Mengele
(known to friénds only as ‘“Doc”)
claiming to be “from somewhere
in South America”.

Following a smashing tour of
the Middle East, which ended
with the band’s arrest in Tel Aviv,
the group went back to their studio
in Berchestgarten to record their
appalling new effort, Back to
Dachau. After various battles
with record censors (within their
record company), the album is fi-
nally here in the States.

For the band, the record is a
triumph, musically. From the
symphonic Wagner-influenced
“Triumph of the Will”, to the sub-

lime bluesy acoustic instrumental,
“Mass Grave Reinvention”, this
expansive album broadens
Genocide’s musical spectrum
from their early hard-core punk
days. But the points where this
musical maturity scores turn re-
viewers’ (like this one) opinions
from positve (black) to negative
(red) only after examing the ex-
tensive lyric sheet.

Until this year when the
P.M.R.C. made it necessary for
all bands to print their lyrics, no
one really knew what Eichman
was screaming behind Antonio's
screeching guitar attack. In fact, I
always thought their early hit,

“The Oven Still! Burns” was about
a firey, sordid affair (between two
lovers, I mean). But Genocide has
decided to come out of the closet
and declare their special brand of
prejudice to the world. The result
is some of the worst taste on vinyl
(without ketchup, I might add).
This tastelessness oozes most ap-
parently on the single, “Midnight
Train to Auschwitz”, a jangling
rockabilly number.

Almost as bad is “Treblinka
Sunrise”, a trashy, yet stirring bal-
lad of an SS trooper who defends
his post from the Red Army —
and pays dearly. ,

But the band has enough sen-

sibility to know how unrealisti-
cally extreme their own views are
and they make this clear in the
beautifully cascading cut “My
Baby’s a Lampshade”.

Racism aside, Back to Dachau
is a marvelous record. If not for its
musical breadth, then for its ex-
ploration jnto the dark recesses of
the human psyche. It is not a re-
cord to be taken seriously; nor is it
a record to be laughed at. It should
merely be accepted or rejected on
the basis of what it is or is not.
Genocide is so bad that they des-
erve a place in the souls of devoted
rock fans everywhere.
