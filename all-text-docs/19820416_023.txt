Nevertheless, two housing develop-
ments are under way at this time.

of Griffith Street has current approval to
build up to 39 patio-type townhouses,
although sewage facilities are currently
available for only 20 homes. Davidson’
Landing, near the entrance to Interstate
77, now may be developed to contain 19 .
houses. The Lake Norman Develop-
ment Corporation, which is a subsidiary
of the SYNCO holding company of
Charlotte, is responsible for this subde-
velopment. This company has strong
ties with Davidson College. The Col-
lege has money invested in the company
and it is partially run by alumni. Ulti-

along Laxe ‘vorman, could be devel-
oped by this company. -
