...Football Prospects

‘Continued from page 8)

Farrell is determined to
“ive or die’ with the kind of
football he believes in. He
stresses execution, efficiency
and simplicity. He sees David-
son running a balanced attack
next year

“‘A football team must do
three things offensively to
win. We must run between the
tackles, run around end and
throw the football. When the
defense adjusts to one thing,
you then switch to another,”
Farrell said

“The play action plays are
the best plays in football. Once
vou make the linebackers
commit, you are home free. If
you run well you pass well,
and vice versa. With our per-
sonnel we will use some
variation of the I formation
with two backs and a third in a
slot or on a wing for counters.
We want to be able to get three
wide receivers downfield,”’ he
added.

The team will use the defen-
se known as the Tennessee 5 or
bubble. It’s a variation of the
old 5-2 with a linebacker up in
the middle. The team will use
few stunts and a simple front.
Execution will be the key here
too.

“Gimmicks don't win foot-
ball games. We will have few
offensive and defensive plays.
Our goal will be to execute so
well that confusing the other

team is unnecessary ,”’ Farrell ©

said.

“Football is my _ life,”’
Farrell explained. ‘‘I would
not have taken the job if I
didn't feel we could win here,
for my job ultimately depends
on winning. ;

“I coach student athletes.

Studies come first. but as long
as football comes second and
not any further back, we can
bring the caliber of football
play up to the level of the other
parts of Davidson College.”

you know what kind of animal

is, you would probably
recognize one immediately if
you saw one. These computer

New
Faculty

The Davidson faculty will be
augmented by the addition of
two new members next year.
The philosophy and drama
departments will be utilizing
their talents.

Robert F. Maydole, now an
assistant professor of
philosophy at St. John's
University, will be working
here in the same capacity.
Maydole holds a B.S. in math
from St. Joseph's Coilege in
Philadelphia and a Ph. D. in
philosophy from _ Boston
University. He has taught at
St. John’s since 1969. His areas
of specialization include logic,
the philosophy of science, and
interdisciplinary studies.

The new instructor of
drama, Joseph Gardner. will
be a returning Davidson alum-
nus. A member of Omicron
Delta Kappa as well as of
Alpha Psi Omega, he won the
Davidson College Drama
Award in 1969. For a year af-
ter graduation, Gardner ser-
ved as designer and technical
director here. and _ then
enlisted in the Navy for two
years. He holds an M.A. in
theatre from Florida State
University, where he is
currently completing work on
his Ph.D. in theatre.

sheets have been used ex-
perimentally during the last
two examination periods as
student course evaluation
sheets.

Vice President of Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan
initiated the system in
coalition with William B.
Hight and the educational
testing department. The
results of the computerized
study of teachers and courses
will be completed by today.
The evaluations are part of the
administration's efforts to
comply with a faculty request
for periodic self evaluations.

Bevan said that the reports
will be available to three
groups. The professor himself
may use the reports to enhan-
ce “his own development as a
teacher and his own im-
provement.”

They will be available to

department chairmen so they
can use them in their talks
with professors and as input
for their yearly written re-
ports. Bevan will also have ac-
cess to the evaluations.

Finally, students who are
making up the manual for
faculty evaluations will be
able to use the reports. Bevan
hopes that these students will
examine the evaluations
before they start.

He believes that, although
data was published with this
year’s manual, in many cases
it was ignored when writing
the evaluation of a course and
teacher.

‘*Evaluation is only
valuable in relationship to
development.”" commented
Bevan. He hopes that the
Student Instructional Reports
will help teachers develop
more effective teaching
styles.
