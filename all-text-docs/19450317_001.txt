Two excellent artists, the duo-
Pianists Dorothy Bechtel and Edith
Steinmetz, were heard in concert
here, February 26, High-lights of
the well-received program were the
Schumann Andante and: Variations
an entertaining suite by Arensky,
and the Blue Danube Waltzes. The
performance was equal in quality
to those of the concert series of
past years and made up in part for
the lack of such a series.

Sut aes

Last Sunday, March 11, the
Queens- Davidson Symphony made
its debut on the campus. Miss Jane
Crecraft of the Queens’ faculty was
‘cello soloist in Elegie by Faure.
The orchestra, directed by Mk
Thomas Hibbard of Queens and Mr.
Pfohl, also played the overture.
Die Entfuehrung aus dem Serail, by
Mozart, an Orchestal Quartet by
Stamitz, and Schubert’s melodic 5th
Symphony, the number most en-
joyed by the large audience.

For the concerts of the orchestra
and band, the auditorium of Shearer

Hall has been cleaned and made,

presentable. The smaller hall is
well-suited to the decreased audien-
ces of war-time Davidson, and ‘its
acoustic quality makes it excellent
for the enjoyment of music.

Pan-Hell Plans
Spring Frolics

Dances Will Be Held April
27-28; Peddicord Expected
To Play Again

Plans are underway for the sec-
ond set of dances to be held in the
college gym this semester: Spring
Frolics which are to be held on
the week-end of April 27th and 28th.

The Pan-Hellenic Council is mak-
ing arrangements for the same
type of week-end as was witnessed
at Mid-Winters: A record dance
on Friday night, and a formal
orchestra dance on Saturday. The
council is attempting to secure the
services of John Peddicord and his
orchestra for the Saturday night
dance.

Using the Spring theme, the gym
will be attractively decorated in
pastel shades, and fixtures befitting
the season.

It is not known as yet whether
or not the faculty rules governing
this dance will remain the same as
they were for the last dance, but
they will be announced as soon as
they are released. The arrangements
for, keeping dates in Duke Dormitory
will probably remain as they were
at Mid-Winters. Later plans will be

announced as they are made official.

Dr. Hubert Poteat

SPEAKER

Speaks Here Twice

Chapel Talk On _ Intellectual
Maturity

On last Friday, Davidson was
host to Dr. Hubert McNeil Poteat,
Professor of Latin at Wake Forest
College, and prominent Southern
educator. Dr. Poteat delivered two
lectures during his stay: one at
chapel, and one at the Guest House
lounge Friday night. ‘

For the chapel address, Dr, Po-
teat used as his subject: “Intellec-
tual Maturity.” After commenting
upon the eee, i involved in the
attainment of i®ellectual maturity
due to the natural sloth and compla-
cency inherent in the human being
as well as to the lowered standards
of our ‘elementary schools, he out-
lined the following essential ingre-
dients to the attainment of mental
stability and maturity: (1) The deve-
lopment of the habit of feeding the
mind on good things. “That, he said
“encompasses our cultural attain-
ment.” (2) Habit of doing ones
own thinking and thus establishing
a position of mental independence,
(3)Achievement of tolerance through
cultivation of the habit of deferring
judgements until the evidence is all
in. (4) The habit of ministry, whose
ultimate objective ‘and motive is al-
truism, “Good deeds, said the spea-
ker, “are more vital to life than
creeds and the intricacies of labor-
ed theologies.’

At the Friday night lecture, Dr.
Poteat used as his subject: “The
Relationship of Christianity to the
Roman Government”, Beginning
with the observation that these rela-
tionships had been studied only from
the Christian viewpoint, he continu-
ed by giving the reasons for ‘the
persecution of the Christians. They
are as folldws: (1) They were con-
fused with the Jews. (2) They
preached the doctrine of the bro-
therhood of the slave. (3) They were
pacifists. (4) They were victims of
a vicious that
looked revolutionsts, they
were compelled to meet in secret,
which made them break the law of
secret meetings. (5) They were
fiercely intolerant, Dr. Roteat went
on to say that the ‘only interest
which the Romans had in the Christ-
ians was ‘to see whether or not they
were breaking the Roman law or
not. They did. not care what the
