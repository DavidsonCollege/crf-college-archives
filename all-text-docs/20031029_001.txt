Spooky tales bring past to life

Exploring the College archives
for haunted tales from the past

ing in 1921.

No dark, stormy night necessary: Davidson’s best-
known ghost story began on a crisp November morn-

A fire of unknown origin furiously consumed the
Chambers building, which then housed classrooms
and a residence wing. Before a fire company from
Mooresville could arrive, Chambers was demolished.

College President W.J. Martin summoned students
and faculty to the Old Well where they sang a school

victory song together. Behind them, in the smoke,
stood only a few hollow columns.

During years of dry weather, material from the
original’ Chambers foundation still rises through the
soil and leaves a distinct outline of the old building.

The ghost is now best visible from the third floor of
the new Chambers building which was erected behind
the ruins of the original. Any unbelievers may visit the
Davidson archives for photographs.

Another ghost story in the making

Jan Blodgett, College Archivist for nine years, has
been busy of late piecing together another Davidson
mystery that may prove frightening to many a pre-med

Among the highlights:

- The 492 members of the fresh-
man Class of 2007 comprise the
school’s largest class ever.

Beginning next year, Vagt said the
College would aim to decrease the

‘icials outline State of College

size of future classes until the popula-
tion returns closer to 1,600 students.

-The College will take a “breather”
from major construction projects af-
ter Patterson Court and Chambers
renovations are completed next year,
Vagt said.

- Tuition increased by 3.8 percent
last year compared to a national rate
of eight percent.

“We’re not particularly proud of
that, but it’s as low as wecan makeit,”
said Vagt, also pointing out that fi-
nancial aid increased by 14 percent.

Eight Richardson dorm

rooms robbed in break-in
Police seek four suspects for questioning

By SARAH-GRACE WESLEY
Staff Writer

A string of break-ins occurred on
three floors in Richardson Hall this
past Saturday night.

The intruders entered eight rooms
on all-male floors and stole a collec-
tive sum of $519 from 13 students.
While some residents were robbed of
$5 to $10, others had as much as $200
taken.

There are currently several sus-
pects, including three individuals
from outside of the College commu-
nity and an unidentified lone’ indi-
vidual. The police are now looking
for these individuals for questioning.

According to Director of Public
Safety Fountain Walker, even if a
perpetrator is now out of state, he or
she can still be extradited and tried in
North Carolina. Breaking-and-enter-
ing is a felony, andthe. person(s)
responsible are wanted on eight

counts, he said.

Hall Counselor Brad Lifford °05
had a few dollars taken but was an-
gered in light of the especially large
sums taken from his hall.

“I’m more upset about my resi-
dents being stolen from than myself,”
he said.

President Bobby Vagt expressed
the sentiments of many members of
the community regarding what he
calls ‘“‘a basic optimistic view of hu-
man nature” that is taught at
Davidson.

He said many students feel that
they do not have to lock their doors
and when “something like this hap-
pens, it comes as a slap in the face.”

Richard Shayegan ’07 had over
$50 taken and said that he will be
locking his door from now on. “I
can’t believe someone came in while
we were sleeping, and we didn’t wake

Since the beginning of the fall se-
mester, numerous acts of vandalism
have occurred throughout campus,
incurring over $12,000 in repair costs.

Intruders have broken into both
Warner Hall and Turner eating houses
and have smeared food on the walls
and floor. Additionally, Warner Hall
reported that trespassers have broken
windows and left on a gas stove over-
night.

Along with the destruction of the
houses, several lampposts on
Patterson Court as Well as Martin
Court have been damaged. Accord-
ing to Campus Safety Director Foun-
tain Walker, the total replacement
and partial repair of lampposts alone
has amounted to an estimated
$10,500.

In more extreme vandalism cases,

CoHo Eating House and the Kappa
Alpha Fraternity were both recent
sites of attempted arson. KKK graffiti
was also discovered four weeks ago
on a sidewalk outside of the laundry
facility and on a wall adjacent to the
Belk Computer Lab.

Furthermore, many students have
reported the destruction of personal
property by their peers. In one in-
stance, a student’s plastic lawn chairs
were taken and smashed against a
brick pillar.

dalism happens students who care
about this place are upset and an-
