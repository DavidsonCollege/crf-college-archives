Indications are that one of the larg-|
cst crowds in the history of the school |
will attend the annual Homecoming |
Day this Saturday, October 21st. Ap-
plications for tickets to the Davidson-
Duke game Saturday, and letters to the |
alumni secretary all point to a capacity
crowd for next Saturday.

Alumni from Ohio, from Florida,
from West Virginia, and .from many
other states in the East and South
have notified authorities here that they
will be present for the festivities Sat-
urday. |

A full program has been arranged |
for the returning former students. At
ten forty-five there will be a meet be-|
tween the Davidson Freshman cross-
country team and the Winston-Salem
harriers, to be followed closely by the}
varsity meet with Duke, which is¥
scheduled for eleven o'clock. At eleven

Radio Program

Due to the shifting of commer-
cial programs which necessarily
have their choice as to time, it
has been necessary to move the
time for the Davidson quarter-
hour again. The time has been
changed to 8:45 on Wednesday
nights, and this is expected to re-
main stationary for a while.

Station officials in Charlotte
say that the letting of winter
contracts causes the great num-
ber of changes. One of the men
there remarked, “If you want to
sell a spot, just give it to David-
son for a week.”

Plans are being developed for
broadcasting the program direct
from Davidson. It is planned to
lease a wire from the telephone
company and to relay the pro-
gram to WBT over this wire. In
this way all the facilities of the
college could be employed in the
programs.

Letters
from several alumni and friends
of the college saying that they
enjoyed the program.

have been received

forty-five there will be a short meet- |
ing of the alumni in the auditorium, at |
which time the president of: the col-
lege, Dr. Lingle, will make an address
of welcome to the returning alumni,
and Mr. James C. Pfohl will play on
the organ, The new alumni secretary,
Grier Martin, and the new director of
music, Mr. Pfohl, will be presented to
the assembled body. At 12:30 there
will be a luncheon served to the alumni
in the banquet hall of Chambers Build-
ing. All friends and relatives of alumni
are invited to attend, as this will not
be an exclusively alumni affair.

Then at 2:30 the main attraction of
the day will be presented when Da-)|
vidson meets Duke on the football |
field, The Blue Devils, conquerors of |
the great Tennessee, will be favored |
to win, but you never can tell what the
Wildcats will do on Homecoming Day.
In 1929 they upset the dope and de-|
feated a much more powerful Duke}
eleven, and again in 1931 they held the
Dukesters to a 0-0 tie, when they were
doped to lose by several touchdowns. |

Enoch, chief fortune telier ‘for the|
Wildcats, has said that the game will)
end in a tie, and the ancient janitor |
hasn’t missed one so far this season. |

A colorful Homecoming crowd will
watch the Duke-Davidson encounter.
Returning alumni, their wives and chil-
dren, girls, invited up for the week-
end house parties, and a student body
and faculty keyed to a high pitch. It
will be a great day!

V. M. I. Game Tickets

Reduced for Alumni

Many alumni took advantage of the
opportunity to.see the Davidson-V. M.|
I. game last Saturday at reduced rates |
offered by the Athletic Association.
Alumni were given seats for $1.00, and}
the regular price was $1.65.

Captain Norton G, Pritchett said that |
this was to be made an annual event,
and that at some game each year the
alumni would be admitted at a reduced
rate. This action was made possible

Dr. Miller Unable to
Speak at “Y” Vespers

Dr. W. L. Lingle received a message
last Saturday evening stating that Dr.
Julian S. Miller, the speaker for last
Sunday's Y. M. C. A. vesper services,
would be unable to speak at that par-
ticular time. Dr. Miller’s daughter had
