Ironing The Gridiron

Coack Bill Dole’s resignation
comes at a time when Davidson is
resting somewhat uncomfortably on
one of the bottom rungs of the Con-
ference football ladder. Many are
they who are convinced that a change
in the head coaching position will re-
sult in a miraculous change in the
record of our football team.

We hope they are right, but we
seriously doubt it. One change — even
one so significant as the position of
head coach — will not make a team
suddenly competitive. Our entire
football program needs overhauling.

In his recent Open End discussion
of the athletic situation, Dr. W. G.
McGavock pointed out three feasible
changes increase scholarships,
eliminate football scholarships, or
eliminate all subsidized athletics.

Coach Dole has emphasized the
need for an increaséd number of
scholarships. Moreover, a large num-
ber of alumni support a change in this
direction.

But does Davidson want to spend
more money here? The College is
spending more than ever before on
football; she offers more football
scholarships than at any time in the
past. Yet Davidson is far behind any
other school in Southern Conference
in the number of football scholarships
offered. ‘

And, even with an increase in
funds, would the College with her
high academic standard be able to re-
cruit the number of athletes necessary
to produce a team able to compete ef-
fectively in the Southern Conference?
We found interesting the announce-

Of Vows And Tests

Since the action almost two months
ago by the Board of Trustees on the
faculty vow, students have continued
to ask us why an essentially student
newspaper should be concerned with
a prescribed faculty religious oath.

If a student's concern for David-
son is limited to the present, if his
concern does not look into the years
ahead, then we say, “Forget about
the oath.”

But if a student is a part of that
vast group of men who do have an
interest in the future of Davidson
College, then for him to experience
anxiety when viewing the oath is nat-
ural.

In a very direct fashion, the oath
concerns the faculty. But in that the
composition of the taculty is vital to
Davidson College and her student
body, students likewise have a very
definite reason to become aroused.
And it is fitting and timely that they
do so.

Most members of our community
concur with the intentions of the
oath, namely to further Davidson's
Christian commitment. But they
wonder whether the oath is successful
in attaining its goal. Is the vow — or
the religious test proposed as a sub-
stitute — in actuality harmful to the
College and the College’s commit-
ment?

The proposed test is honest in
that it is given to all faculty members
and applicants for position on the fac-
ulty. The present vow is given only
to full professors.

Noted In Passing

Says one news item this week:
“Mayor F. L. Jackson of Davidson has
been advised that the Mecklenbur
County Department of Sanitation will
be making an inspection...

“According to Mayor Jackson, in-
spection in this general area will be-
gin shortly, or may already be in pro-
gress.”

We wonder what facilities are slat-
ed for a check.

ment this week that Davidson had
the most nominees for the Scholastic
All-Southern Conference Team while
Davidson’s actual playing record left
her near the conference cellar.

Professor McGavock advocated the
complete elimination of subsidized
athletics, a heresy at Davidson espe-
cially when pronounced on the eve of
basketball season. But Dr. Mc-
Gavock’s points are the result of con-
siderable study and thought. While
it is an unpopular position, the pro-
fessor’s stand nonetheless merits care-
ful consideration.

However, we look most. favorably
towards the middle ground — the de-
subsidization of football. We do not
think an increase in scholarships is
feasible or satisfactory. Likewise, we
find our present posture quite un-
comfortable.

We would like to see Davidson
eliminate her football scholarships
over the next four years. That there
would be problems — with the South-
ern Conference, with scheduling, with
finances — is obvious. But although
complex, these problems can be over-
come.

The final authority lies with the
Trustees. But any change in the over.
all athletic policy of the College would
probably originate or at least pass
through the Stees’ Athletic Com-
mittee. Serving on the three-man body
are Dr. Thomas Sparrow of Charlotte,
D. R. LaFar Jr. of Gastonia, and John
I. Smith of Travelers Rest, S.C.

These three gentlemen are in a
position to initiate a definite improve-
ment in Davidson's athletic picture.
We hope they do.

But in being honest such a test for
prospective faculty members would
present a false picture of Davidson to
the prospective faculty member. Un-
fortunately the questions of the test
would all too frequently be regarded
as indicative of the institution con-
cerned with indoctrination rather than
education. Davidson is not a dogmat-
ic institution, but such would tend
to be her unwarranted reputation in
future years.

Davidson is a church-related in-
stitution. But this does not mean that
she must administer a religious test
in order to assure her getting desir-
able faculty members.

We urge that a statement of stand-
ards. to be met by prospective faculty
members at Davidson should be is-
sued by the Trustees after consulta-
tion with members of the present
faculty and administration.

The standards would be followed
by the President and the Dean of
Faculty as a guide in personnel pro-
curement. Rather than the prospec-
tive faculty member being confronted
with a written religious test or a
formal oath, the President and Dean
of Faculty would be entrusted with
the responsibility of determining
whether prospective faculty members
measure up to prescribed standards.
The manner in which administrators
assure themselves that the require-
ments are met in prospective profes-
sors should and would vary according
to the individual under consideration.

each election back in the days before

On November 23 Student Council
set up a committee to study the role
and functions of fraternities at David-
son. Student Body President Will
Jackson was named chairman of the
group and was authorized to appoint
the other members of the committee.

We asked Chairman Jackson early
this week if he would have the com-
mittee selected by Wednesday. He
replied negatively.

There are many able men who
would gladly serve on the committee.
They only need to be asked. And
most of them could be contacted with-
in an hour.

It is imperative that study get
underway... But when, Mr. Jackson?

Soph Places Emphasis
On Manor Independence

Dear Editor:

In an earlier THE DAVID-
SONIAN, a letter from. Arthur
Ross appeared. While the letter
contained some statements with
which I agree, there are some
statements concerning Lingle
Manor with which I disagree.

Mr. Ross states that “Lingle
Manor needs a more effective
leadership and an understand-
ing of the problems confronting
those who try to operate a suc-
cessful social organization.”
Concerning the “understanding
of the problems confronting
those who try to operate a suc-
cessful social organization .. .”’.
I would like to say that in the
several years of the develop-
ment of Lingle Manor, problems
have indeed arisen.

However, I believe that these
problems have been met and
dealt with in such a way that
the members of the Manor do
have and are gaining still an
understanding of these problems,
It is true that we are a young.
struggling organization, but we
do have the leaders and the
understanding necessary “‘to
maintain a successful social or-
ganization.”

In this same statement by Mr.
Ross which I have been consid-
ering, the phrase ‘‘successful so-
eial organization” appears. I!
would like to know Mr. Ross’
definition of “successful.” If suc-
cessful may be taken to mean.
at least in part, successful in
the sense of planning expens'v2
parties or activities a month ant
a half in advance, the Mano: ‘s
truly a failure.

Lingle Manor cannot. plan de-
finite activities far in advance
due to the fact that it is an or-
ganization of voluntary partict-
pation, and this voluntary parti-
cipation lies at the very heart
of the organization. Due to this
voluntary _ participation, no
member is bound to pay for or

Young's terminology. were
“.... rejected by 73% of the
student body.” I maintain that
for most students not recelving
bids this rejection is a deep and
not momentary hurt. In time
this hurt heals, but it is never
forgotten.

I'm not sure that a majority
of the members of Lingle Man-
or would look with favor on the.
prospect of having an advisory
board of fraternity men who
would be offering ‘brotherly as-
sistance and who would be rep-
resentatives of that same sys-
tem which once denied its broth-
erhood to those whom they then
would seek to aid.

A PARADOXICAL SITUATION

To me. this proposed commit-
tee would be irreconcilably par-
adoxical in its very nature. First
the fraternity system would
deny its brotherhood to some
students but later would seek
to offer.some sort of brotherly
advice to a group whose mem-
bership. for the most part.
would be made up of those-who
had been denied the brotherhood
of the fraternities.

These feelings of tension and
mistrust are in no stretch of the
imagination good traits for an
organization to have, but I be-
lieve these traits would appear
if such a fraternity advisory
board to Lingle Manor were es-
tablished.

This is not to say that there
can be no co-operation between
the fraternity system and Lingle
Manor. Ths co-operation is in-
deed necessary, but the two or-
ganizat:‘ons must remain separ-
ate from cach other in their re-
spective governmental set-ups.

I must stress one fact here.
The views expressed above are
mine alone. and they are not
the official opinions of the Board
of Directors of Lingle Manor or
of any other members. I must
admit that my views are biased,

participate in any activity with -but I have tried to be as objec-

which he is at variance. Thus,
plans for definite activities can-
not be made until three weeks
in advance and sometimes
even later when members have
decided whether or not they
will participate in an activity

tive as I know how. I ask only
toleration of those biased opin-
ions which are present.

ADVISORY COMMITTEE

Mr. Ross proposed also that
to raise the respect for Lingle
Manor on campus, the I.F.C.
might appoint ‘‘a committee of
fraternity leaders to actually
join Lingle Manor and not take
it over, but work with the other
members .. .”

Dear Editor:

I just received my copy of
THE DAVIDSONIAN for the
week, and after reading of the
debate over fraternities. I de-
cided to throw in an opinion.
First, for those of you who do
not know me, I was a fraternity
man and graduated in 1964. I,

First of all. I should itke to like Rick von Unwerth and Bob
say that I, as a member of Lin- Young, was a member of a fra-
gle Manor, am not desirious of ternity:in*1960-61 when this ques-
having such a committee of tion was last seriously debated.
members who would be ap- The. present suggested chatiges
pointed to join. Lingle Manor to the fraternity system are
is an organization which, I be- even more ridiculous than those

one placed in it who might not
wish to be there.

Secondly, I believe that if a
committee of fraternity men
were established to aid the Man-
or in an advisory capacity,
there would be a tension with
this committee and also mis-
trust of it on the part of some!
of the members. This is a fair-
ly harsh statement. but I shall
try to show why I think it i
true,

Some who have joined Lingle Ms
Manor are those who received LEZ
bids. Yet it is true that a major. jeesagieeaee
ity of our membership consists
of those who, to use Mr. Robert

Granted. the fraternity system
is not perfect. But I maintain
that it is probably the best sys-
tem in an environment which
would be out of the question
without it. Davidson College
was good to me. The fraternity
was an important part of my
life there as a social outlet.

A fraternity, by nature in the
past, has been a mutually se-
lective group which organized
for social purposes. One hun-
dred percent bidding would ef-
fectively defeat this purpose
and bring the end of the fratern-
ity system. The end of fraterni-
ties would end organized socia!

life, intramural athletics, com-.

munity projects by the fra-
ternity, etc. It would also break
a strong tie which many alumni
have with the school. One hun-
dred percent bidding is out of
the question!

“BETTER TO REJECT”

The twenty-three percent are
not outcasts. as some have said.
With respect to their not having
been bid, I will say this. It is
better to reject someone who
would not fit. into a group than
to take him. It may be a shock
to be rejected, but it is easier
to readjust after the shock than
it is to be ostracized for four
years. This may sound like
crude law of the jungle, but it
is also a fact of society.

Sophomore rush is also out of
the question, for reasons which
I assume have already been
pointed out, such as no fresh-
man social life, fraternity fi-
nances, rush rules, etc. Delayed
rush solves some problems. It
eliminates the hasty decision
for both parties. It does allow
some adjustment time for fresh-
men. It also creates the prob-
lem of rush rules and their en-
forcement. It would probably
be feasible to delay rush for six
weeks; and allow only those who
hold a C average after five

_ weeks grades to be eligible.

“GOOD AND WORKABLE”

These arguments are not new.
The fraternity system has evolv-
‘ed down through the years,
much the same way that the
drinking rule has. Neither is
perfect, but both are good and
workable under any circum-
stances. I have yet to see a
workable suggestion for im-
provement.

I do hope that from this de-
bate the fraternities will redis-
cover some of their apparently
lost responsibilitties. This was
the net result four years ago,
and there is no reason why it
can not be so again. The fra-
ternity system is good. It just
needs a kick in the pants oc-
casionally.

Once More
With Feeling

‘By TIM KIMREY
Davideontan Associate Editor

Thanksgiving was never more than just a day. It
was always the sime at home. It seemed funny for my
father to be at home at ten o'clock in the morning — he
looked out of character wearing a sport-shirt on a week-
day morning. At breakfast he didn’t smell of Mennen;
he and my mother sat at the table and drank coffee after
we had gone to play football. He said he would join us
soon, but he never did

We would play football for a while, but it was never
a good game — nothing like the Saturday games. And
then too, it was that time of year when there was a temp-
tation to change over to basketball. But the court was
covered with pine-needles — which none felt like sweep-
ing away — so we couldn't get very excited about basket-
ball.

Soon all the kids drifted back to their various sec-
tions of the neighborhood. We would arrive to find my
father raking pine-needles in the front yard. My sister,
who was younger, and I would sort of involuntarily pick
up rakes and begin to languidly drag them across the
slick straw. My father would smile and thank us. Soon
a self-generating energy and enthusiasm would quietly
overtake us all; as the soft and shiny winter grass began
to appear beneath the brown blanket of needles. The
sun filtered down through the tall, slim pine-trees —
our efforts added color to the world and we were silently
proud of our thoroughness. -

Soon the pine-needles were all piled at the foot of
the drive-way. My sister was distressed that a rake
would not sweep the drive-way clean of pine-needles;
she went to the car-port and got a broom. My father
would take a single wooden match out of his pocket and
light the pile of needles. The smoke was very thick and
almost pure white; I enjoyed holding my hand in the
rising cloud and then pulling. it away — the smoke would
cling to my arm for several seconds.

We would leave the fire to burn itself into a tender
mass of charred filaments. On the way back to the house
my father would hum a Thanksgiving hymn: ‘We gather
together to ask the Lord’s blessing.” My mother would
greet us at the door and compliment us on the way the
yard looked. It was beautiful. My sister and I would
exchange smiles, and my father would pick her up around
the waist and fling her up on his shoulder. Gleeful
laughter.

In the kitchen, we could smell “The Bird,” as my
father called it. I would run to open the oven and smell
— every time the hot vapors would burn my face. On
the counter would be a dish of sweet potatoes with marsh-
mellows on top—ready for the oven. I would scramble
to get the bowl first when we got ready for dinner, so I
could have more toasted marshmellows than anyone else.

My mother would set a bowl of home-made soup
on the kitchen table — the kind with string beans and
chunks of roast beef and pieces of tomatoes and cabbage,
to tide us over until the Feast. “Hurry,” she would say,
“Your father doesn’t want to be late to the football
game.”

The football games were always the same. My fath-
er would smoke his pipe and say nothing; my mother
would alternately comment to my father and entertain
my little sister, who would dangle her feet and gaze at
the man drinking out of the brown paper bag in. front
of us. I wouid cheer for a while an then lose interest
and start to feel the cold.

It would be dark when we arrived at home again.
My sister and I would steal a glance at the front yard
to be sure it looked as neat as it had that morning. Short-
ly my grandparents would arrive — would interrupt the
harmony of the day. Now there would be talk of aunts
and second cousins and “She was a Jackson before she
married Gerald Shoaf's brother.” The Feast was always
the same and always good. Stuffed, my sister and I
would become bored after mince-meat pie and finish

the evening playing parchesi. I always ate too many
marshmellows.

And so it was every year, with minor variations, due,
I guess, to the fact that my sister and I grew older every
year. But somehow, Thanksgiving always seemed the
same — just another day, that was supposed to be special,
but whose meaning was somehow never clear. I learned
about Thanksgiving in the second grade, when Miss Holt
read to us about the Pilgrims and I made a turkey out

of red construction paper. And that’s all I really knew
or understood of Thanksgiving.

And then, this year, there was no football game . . .
no pine-needles . . . no grandparents . . . no parchesi.
Being away from home brought me to a realization of
what I think Thanksgiving really is. It is, in fact, just
another day. No more reason to give thanks here than
on any other day. Before, Thanksgiving had been sort
of forced upon me; now, I had to make my own in strange
surroundings.

And I found it useless to list blessings, as if they
were coins in my pocket. Somehow, this had always

led me to remember all the misfortunes which seemed
to counter-balance the gifts.

This year I was reduced to simply giving thanks for
Life, and the chance to live it in all the excitement it
offers. For a heart that beats and a mind that only
occasionally comprehends, for the peace and for the tur
moil, I was grateful.
