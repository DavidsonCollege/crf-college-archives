Wildcats Lose to Alabama, Come Back to
Humiliate Methodist in Season's First 100 Point Game

By Bruce Balestier
Alabama 76 Davidson 59

With a 76-59 loss to 17th-
ranked Alabama November 23,
Davidson’s basketball team proved
that it can compete evenly with a
top-20 team. ‘Bama’s lead was just
11 points with 1:51 remaining, and
Crimson Tide coach Wimp San-
derson was forced to play his start-
ing unit nearly the entire game.
The Wildcats frustrated Alabama
somewhat with stingy halfcourt
defense, but transition defense was
the difference; the Tide got easy
shots and easy baskets from the
fast break.

Davidson trailed by eight
points, 36-28, after a fairly even
first half. Senior tri-captain Paul
Denmond kept the Wildcats in the
game with eight first half points;
his jumper atthe 8:23 mark cut the
Alabama.lead to 22-21. Down by
6, the ‘Cats held the ball for the last
possession of the half, but a quick
shot by Janko Narat led to a fast-
break for the Tide. Center-Cedric
Moore’s leaning layup as time
expired in the half gave his team
the 8-point halftime cushion.

In the second half, Davidson
cut.“Bama’s lead to 5 (36-31) ona
three-pointer by Pat Holloway with
19:15 left, and again (42-37) ona
three by Narat with 15:53 to go
before Alabama made their deci-
sive run. Latrell Sprewell’s con-
secutive three-point shots were the
big blows in a 13-0'spurt that gave
the Tide a 55-37 advantage.

Still, Davidson continued to
hack methodically at the lead. A
three-pointer by freshman guard
Frank Harris cut the lead to 66-53
with 3:10 left, and Detlef Musch

scored off a lob pass with 2:38
remaining to make it 66-55. When
Scott Alford passed to Narat for a
fast-break reverse layup with 1:51
left, the lead was again 11 at 68-57.
Three late Alabama layups ac-
counted for the final margin.

Narat led Davidson with 12
points despitea 5-15 showing from
the field. Musch contributed 10
points and Harris 9 (on perfect 4-4
shooting from the floor) for the
‘Cats. Robert Horry paced Ala-
bama with 22 points. Davidson
outrebounded the Tide 34-30, in-
cluding 20-8 on the offensive
boards. The Wildcats did not shoot
a free throw.

After the game, Sanderson
complimented the Davidson per-
formance,
Davidson for the way they played
and the effort they gave,” he said.

Davidson coach Bob McKil-
lop was similarly impressed. “I
thought our guys gave a terrific
effort tonight,” praised McKillop.
“This is why our Dingess come
here.”

Beset by poor play during the.

first 11 minutes of the game,”

Davidson used a late first half run
to put away Division III Method-
ist, and cruised toa 102-73 victory.
The win was marked by the fine
offensive play of freshman guard
Frank Harris. Harris shot 10-13
from the field on the way to 21
points, passed for 6 assists and
collected 4 rebounds.

Having proved in the season
opener against Alabama that they
belonged on the floor with atop-20

“My hat’s off to*

team, the Wildcats set out to prove
in this game that they belonged on
the floor with a Division III team.
The Monarchs opened up a 16-9
advantage thanks to some hot
shooting and lackadaisical play on
both ends by Davidson.

Gradually, though, the ‘Cats
climbed back into the game, pull-
ing even at 17-17 ona pair of free
throws by senior tri-captain Ster-
ling Freeman, and vaulting toa21-
19 lead on.a Harris basket in the
paint with 11:35 left. From there, a
21-3 spurt turned a narrow 25-24
lead into a commanding 46-27
cushion with 3:44 to goin the half.
A layup by Freeman and atip-in by
Janko Narat in the final minute of
the half gave the ‘Cats a 60-39
edge at halftime, and they were
never again threatened.

The second stanza proceeded
in similar fashion; the ‘Cats
hounded the Monarchs with ag-
gressive man-to-man defense, and
utilized their size advantage to gain

easy shots on the offensive end.

Davidson finished with fourdunks,
three by center Detlef Musch and
one by 6’8" freshman George
Spain.

Musch scored 13 points and
Pat Holloway added 12 for
Davidson. The ‘Cats held a 48-31

rebounding advantage over the

undersized Monarchs. On a nega-
tive note, while the Wildcats forced
18 Methodist turnovers, they
committed 15 of their own.
While Methodisi certainly

_ didn’t provide the physical talent

or size of Alabam, Davidsoncoach
Bob McKillop saw the game as a
test of a different sort. Said McK-

Wrestling Matches Cancelled

Due to Outbreak of Staph Infections

Davidsonian Staff Reports

Wrestling Coach Tom Oddo
was forced to cancel his team’s
matches on Saturday due to an
outbreak of staphylococcus infec-
tions among members of the team.
Davidson had been scheduled to
wrestle Pensacola, Anderson and
the Southern Conference rival the
Citadel in separate dual matches.

The Wildcats picked up the
infection in Tuesday’s loss at Vir-
ginia State. Staph infections are
caused by wrestling on dirty mats.
Because the infections often recur

the sick wrestlers could be out for
a lengthy period of time.

The middle of the Wildcat
lineup took most of the damage.
Henry Neale (142. Ibs.), G.A.
McClung (150 1bs.),Sam Knowles
(1581bs.)and Scott Townsend (167
Ibs.) all contracted the illness.
These starters will likely be re-
placed with more inexperienced
freshmen. Inan unrelated incident
Russ Felker (118 Ibs.) broke his
harid and will be out for several
Onamore positvenote, Jimmy

Stewait (Heavyweight) and Craig
Wall (177 Ibs.) both placed fourth
at the James Madison Invitational
on Nov. 24. Wall and Stewart led
the Wildcats against a strong field
which included the University of
Virginia, William and Mary, Vir-
ginia Tech and American Univer-
sity.

Tampa on Dec. 29, They return to

Washington and Lee and Ander-
son.

our physical toughness, this game
challenged our mental toughness.”

In addition, McKillop praised
the performance of Harris. “Frank
Harris is doing the things we re-
cruited him to do,” he said. “He’s
got good instincts and courtsavvy.
Most importantly, he plays with-
out fear.”

Davidson 71 U. of the South 44

Solid defense was again the
constantas the Wildcats overcame
aterrible offensive first half to beat
the University of the South. Detlef
Musch had his way with the Ti-
gers, scoring 21 points on 9-11
shooting, and claiming 11 re-
bounds.

The ‘Catsheld Sewanee to28%
shooting and 19 points in the open-
ing half, but led by just 4 points
because of an anemic offensive
showing. Davidson committed 13
turnovers and shot just 40% from
the field in the first half. Coach
Bob McKillop felt that his players
“were trying to hit the home run
offensively.”

From the opening possession
of the second half, it was a differ-
entDavidson team offensively. The
‘Cats connected on 63% of their
shotsin the second half, and gradu-
ally built a more than twenty point
lead. Davidson took a 67-39 lead
with one minute left, when fresh-
man walk-on Linton Elliott buried
abaseline jumper for the first points
of his career.

Surprisingly, the improved
second half performance wasn’t
the productofa McKillop diatribe.
McKillop said that he “went into
the lockerroom and applauded their

defensive effort and told them to
relax.”

In addition to Musch’s 21
points, Scott Alford and Frank
Harris contributed 8 points. Thir-
teen men played and 11 scored for
Davidson. The ‘Cats owned a 46-
25 rebounding advantage.

McKillop. singled out his
team’s defensive effort as deserv-
ing of praise, and acknowledged
that the offense has not yet come
together. “I was delighted with the
defensive effort we gave tonight,”
he said. “We.need to maintain that
level of intensity on defense, and
translate that intensity to the of-
fense.”

It was impressive to see
Davidson players diving for loose
balls with anearly thirty point lead
late in the game. Said McKillop,
“If they give that kind of effort
night in and night out, they’ ll geta
lot of victories this year.”

In what is becoming an early
December tradition for William
and Mary fans, the Tribe defeated
Davidson by one point for the third
year inarow, After.a pairof missed
foul shots by William and Mary’s
Scott Smith, Davidson regained
possession for a last shot with six
seconds left. Sophomore Pat Hol-

_loway dribbled the length of the

court to the left corner, but could
not launch a shot before the final
buzzer sounded.

Swimmers Down
Salem & Pfeifer, Stand
With Even 2-2 Record

By Chris Hood

Davidson’s womens’ swimming
and diving squad earned its first
victories of the season at home on
December 4, crushing Salem 76-
11 and edging Pfeiffer 55-54. With
the triumphs, the “Cats break for
Christmas with a 2-2 mark.

The outcome of Pfeiffer contest
hinged on the final event, the.200
freestyle relay. Caroline Prioleau,
Audrey Schuetz, Kristie Moss and
Miche Baskett reigned, and the
‘Cats notched the win.

On November 23, the men trav-
eled to VMI and fell 121-107.
Hayler Osborn captured the
breaststroke, and the divers added
significantly to the ‘Cats pointtotal.

- With. the 1991 portion of their

schedule complete, the men stand

at 0-4,

Head Coach Ron Morrow re-
mains optimistic about this year’s
swimmers and divers. “We're
moving right along, he said.” Al-
though Davidson has suffered due
to numerous injuries, Morrow
stressed that “‘we’re going to do
our best with whomever shows
up.”

Looking forward to 1992, the
‘Cats future looks bright. With
several athletes returning from

_ semesters abroad and the prospect

of some injuries having time to
heal, Davidson swimming and
diving should be at its peak.

The ‘Cats open the second half
of their season at the University of
Tampa during the first week of the
new year. On January 11, Davidson
visits East Carolina, one of the -
strongest programs in the area,
