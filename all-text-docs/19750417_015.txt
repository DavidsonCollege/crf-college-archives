Across the marshflats
a swishing chuckle of crabs.

Chandeliers, azaleas smolder serenely
into night; when once your silhouette
at the turret window enticed

my sailing hands to the trellis,
honeysuckle forced by brine.

The dusking hours are empty-eyed.

Spiders bandage the nursery window
where lights of sportster and limousine
flash. Doorbells. . .jewelled voices

sashay down the grand foyer,

unhaunted heiresses of mosshung arcadies
which give onto our estuary.

A sarabande lends credence to the evening
promendade: from portico to summerhouse,
before mothers fraught with aigrettes

and aplomb, they dip white candles,
curtseying like daffodils

overendowed with pollen. How

seawind freshens this night. they coax
in whispers. From the headwaters, dim
innuendos of carnival; bumpkins
ply beach arcades and piers strung

with stuttering neon.

A clapper rail wheels
down behind the dunes, gabbling distress.

Before chaos, disarray: so I

used to say, and you caught us in your arms

long and small from fever. Before laughter
deserted you, cousin, blossoming,-I

named you sassafras. jessamine. your white throat
kissing my palms, and sun which drains

the cowrie shell of its intricate stripes

drank the color from your eye. . .

Afternoon, blue as the vein

of a phthisic breast. Where are the twelve
brothers promised me? The daughters

of revolution leach to my divans,

scribbling peevishly. Dried figs, trout aspic.
I have one hand for gin, one for rummy:
raising my glass to the trivial ante.

We shall retire to the outer balcony

to view waters a stray manta slaps

in sultry frolic, where sloops contend

over the honeybrown bones of blockade runners.

Crabcakes, pickled cauliflower served,

with twentyfour juleps to be drained ;

to my birth, my long health. The parched daughters
insist upon my signature.

All through the marsh
crabs deploy before the skirmishing tide.
