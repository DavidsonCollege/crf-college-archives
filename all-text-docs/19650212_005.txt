“THERE SHOULD BE A WAY”

Basketball Coach Lefty Driesell, Athletic Director
Tom Scott, and faculty athletic representative Paul Mar-
rotte are in agreement on two basic points concerning
the Southern Conference tournament: (1) it is not the
best way to determine a league champion (2) prospects
for changing the situation are dim.

The general consensus, especially of Scott and
Driesell, seems to be that the league members outside
the top three basketball powers of Davidson, West Vir-
ginia, and VPI would never support a change that would
give a greater advantage to the regular season champ.

Maybe so, but I'd like to see the issue brought up
at the conference meeting this spring and let the lesser
schools try to justify their rather groundless positions.

“There should be a way,” says Dr. Scott, for the
regular season champions to have another crack at the
championship if they are defeated in the tournament.”

Scott favors a playoff between the tournament cham-
pion and regular-season champion.

Dr. Marrotte proposes allowing the second-place
through ninth-place teams participate in a three-round
play-off, with the regular season champ winning a bye
to the championship fourth-round game. As Scott’s
proposal, this would retain the financial benefits of the
tournament and still provide the regular-season champ
with the advantage it has earned in regular-season play.

_ Although skeptical about the possibility of any
changes, Lefty suggests that a nine-man committee
composed of conference athletic directors could decide
the conference’s representative to the Eastern Regionals
on the basis of regular-season play and tournament ac-
tion. Thus, there at least would be a general consensus
that the team going to the regionals is the league’s best
representative.

The present championship-deciding system may be
here to stay for a while, but I'll bet there is’nt one con-
ference coach or athletic director who wouldn’t admit
privately that the system is unjustifiable.

NIT

Lefty also suggests that the Southern Conference at
least allow teams to go to the National Invitational
Tourney in New York, the nation’s most prestigeous
tourney other than that of the NCAA.

The NCAA opposes the NIT because they compete
for independent teams for their post-season matches
and because the NIT is a private money-making concern.

The first cause of NCAA opposition is really no val-|
id reason for the conference preventing teams from
going, as the NCAA allows teams to go, although it does-
n’t approve of members going. The second reason of
opposition is also weak: nobody opposes the football bowl
games because they are private enterprises. The Mis-
souri Valley and Western Athletic conferences have long
allowed their teams that aren’t conference champions
to go to the NIT, and the conference treasuries are the
‘richer for it.

A TOUGH ROW TO HOE

Anyway, Davidson will be in the NCAA tournament
this year, but it looks like the ’Cats haven’t any easy
row to hoe.

Two at-large teams will be chosen for the Eastern
Regionals and Davidson will have to play one of these in
the first round at Philadelphia, probably March 8. The
independents will be fourth-ranked Providence and
either Villanova, which would have a home court advant-
age, or St. John’s, formerly ranked conqueror of
Michigan. ;

The Ivy League champ plays the other independent
and the winner of that game plays the Atlantic Coast
conference representative in the semi-finals March 12
at College Park, Md.

The Middle Atlantic Conference winner, probably St.
Joe, will play the Yankee Conference representative,
probably Connecticut, and the winner of this match will
play the winner of the Davidson game in the semi-finals.

Thus, Davidson could have to play fourth-ranked
Providence, third-ranked St. Joe, an then sixth-ranked
Duke in the finals March 13.

Portland is a long way, but so was an eighteen-game
winning streak and a place among the nation’s top five.;

BODY CONTACT AGAINST COLONIALS
The Closest GW Came In ‘Cat Runaway

GW, W. VA., FURMAN

‘Cats Kill 3 Conference Foes

By SAM BOYTE

Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson's Wildcats picked up
their 19th consecutive win last
last night in a close 55-50 defeat
of Furman to close a week that
included victories over George
Washington University (119-83)
and West Virginia (103-80), as
their record is now 20-1 and their
winning streak is the longest
of any major college in the
nation.

Coach Lefty Dresell broke a
jinx that made him lose every
contest against Furman in
Greenville Memorial Auditorium
in his five years at Davidson.
The Paladins came close to
bringing about a major upset
as they held the lead for the
larger part of the game, a
sticky Furman defense and poor
Wildcat shooting prevented the
‘Cats from breaking the game
open.

Furman now has. a 6-15 record
and is 2-11 in the conference.

The Baptists took the lead at
12-11 with 9:53 remaining in
the first half on a jump shot
by Frank Saier and held it un-
til Dick Snyder put the ‘Cats
ahead 40-38 with 6:36 left in
the game.

‘Minus thelr top scorer Dan
Goolsby, the Paladins held the
unusually tight Davidson team
with a good defense forcing
them to commit 14 ball-losing
violations in the first half and
to take the bad shots. The ‘Cats
hit a miserable 37.2% for the
game.

Davidson played the last 15
minutes of the contest without

zel who fouled out with 11
points.

Catfish Cop 4 Firsts,
Fall 53-51 To Citadel

By MIKE MOOTY
Davidsonisn Sports Writer

Swimmers from The Citadel edged Davidson’s tankmen 53-51 in a nip and tuck
battle in Johnston Gynasium Tuesday.

Led by freestyler Mike Acker-
man, the Cadets jumped to an
early lead, copping first place
in the first three events.

Davidson’s fortunes changed,
however, as Randy Hughes and
Richard Holt took first and
second honors in the 400-yard
individual medley. Hughes put
on the finishing touches by lap-
ping the only Citadel swimmer.

In the diving event, Butch
Falligant and Bill Jacobs placed
one-two for the Wildcats. In the
200-yard - butterfly, Davidson
again took first and second
place, with Jim Stokes turning
in a winning time 2:22.8.

The Bulldogs then took the
100-yard freestyle, with Alex-
ander turning in a respectable
52.7, followed by two quick Cad-
et victories in the 200-yard back-
stroke and gruelling 500-yard

freestyle.
fn ‘Se most exciting event of

the afternoon, Davidson’s Lloyd
Davidson and Citadel’s Denny
Walker matched each other
stroke for stroke in the 200-yard
breaststroke before Walker won
out at the finish. The watches
showed Walker with a 2:39.3
and Davidson with a 2:39.4.

Davidson’s Hughes and Holt
then repeated their previous
performance with Holt taking
an easy win in the 200-yard in-
dividual medley, posting a 2:25-
3.
The meet'then hinged on the
outcome of the final event, the
400-yard freestyle relay. The
Cadet team, led by anchorman
Ackerman, edged the Davidson
quartet, and the Bulldogs took
home first-place honors for the
afternoon.

‘"The Bulldogs are well coach-
ed,” noted Coach Dwight. Shoe,
“and did very well this after-

noon.” He singled out the Cita-
del’s Ackerman as a “good
strong swimmer.”

When asked how he felt his
Wildcats had done, he simply
stated, “Terrific. Shoe quali-

fied his appraisal @ the team's |.
“You |i

performance, however:
know’ though, you don't really

feel like you did a good job if|f

you lose.”*

Shoe pointed out that the
school record in both relays had
been broken that afternoon, the
medley relay record by one sec-
ond and the freestyle mark by
two seconds. Neither of the new
times will replace the old re-
cords, however, because in both
cases Davidson lost the event.

He singled out Jim Stokes for
an especially fine showing in
the meet. Stokes won the 200-
yard butterfly and was a key
man on both relay teams.

Kenneth Blair were named as
assistants. Besides Tomey, one

earlier this season. In that game
Davidson's Fred Hetzel dumped
in 37 points as the hot Wildcats
connected on 60.9% of their field
goals to down a nervous Spider
squad.

Spider Tom Green, a 66
sophomore paced the visitors
with 18 points and 10 rebounds,
even though 6-4 Tenwick, a
somewhat seedy-looking senior,
was leading the team with a
20 point-10 rebound average.

Tenwick, called by Richmond
Coach Lewis Mills ‘ta complete
ball player", leads the Spiders
with 19.2 scoring average, in
rebounding, and jis bagging
48.55 of his ficld goal attempts.

Guards Spike Welsh and John-
ny Moates plus centers George
Alwell and Buster Batts pose

a combination offensive-defen-

sive punch that has since humb-

pumped in 34 points for game
scoring hondrs. All five starters
hit in double figures and boosted
the field goal percentage to
53.9%.

Davidson beat the tall Moun-
taineers 60-40 off the boards, as
Charlie Marcon was third high-
est rebounder behind Hetzel
and Snyder.

Snyder had 23 points; Marcon,
13; and. Davidson 11. Perhaps
more important to Driesell, a
defense man if one ever lived,
was the fact that his team had
a chance to get some game ex-
perience with some new zone de-
fences.

Lacking two of their starters,
thé. Colonials George Washing-
ton University were all but

blown off the court in the first:
, 15 minutes. With three quarters

of the first period elapsed, they
were in more trouble as their
two top substitutes, Dick Ballard
and Ed Rainey, had picked up
four fouls apiece in a vain at-
tempt to stop Hetzel.

Snyder gave Davidson a 2-0
lead on a jump shot after the
tap-off, and the ‘Cats never re-
linquished that lead as they

’ stretched it to a 20-point mar-
; gin in the first six minutes of

the runaway as, the
reached 22-2.

Hetzel made a strong start to-
ward his game-high 35 points
in this initial spurt with 7 points,
followed by Don Davidson,
whose twisting lay-ups continued
to amaze the ‘Cats’ 14th sellout
crowd of the season as the 6-5
senior scored a career high of
27 points.

Snyder took third among the
scorers with 26 points as four
of the five starters placed in
double figures.

Hetzel tossed in 19 of 20 free
throw opportunities, his high for
the season.

Little sophomore Joe Lalli,
a 5° 8" sharpshooter, entered
the game early and hit on sev-
eral long shots to keep the Col-
onials from being run off the
court completely and to con-
vince Coach Bill Reinhart's
group that it was possible to
score against the mighty Wild-
cats.

Richmond carries an 8-13 over-

slate into the match, the Vir-
ginians’ last. home contest. The
cumulative record between
Richmond and Davidson over
the last 12 years stands at 3
wins for the Spiders against 7
triumphs for the Wildcats.

Davidson's Hetzel carries a 27-
point scoring average and a 15-

Grapplers Win Once,

Lose Once

In Atlanta

By PAUL MARION
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson’s wrestling team returned from Atlan-
ta last weekend with a win and a loss, pushing the
season record to 2-3-1 as they downed Emory 26-7,
and fell to Georgia Tech 21-11.

In the Emory victory, Coach Parker’s chargers

won every match except a forfeit in the 177 pound
class and Joe Buffington’s draw in the 123-pound

weight class.

The winners were Martin Miller

(130), Mike Bizard (137), Jesse Sims (147), Terry
O’Hair (157), Eric Nichols (167), and heavyweight

Bobby Howard.

Although the Wildcat grapplers were tied 11-11
with Georgia Tech before the last two matches, How-
ard lost his match in the 177-pound class and the
heavyweight match was lost by forfeit. Coach Parker
regretted that, ‘We have not had a heavyweight all

year.”

Joe Buffington won his match to remain undefeat-

ed and Mike Bisard upped his season record to 6-0
by pinning his opponent. Eric Nichols won his match
by a decision.

Next week brings two important matches to
Johnston Gymnasium: The Citadel varsity and
freshmen teams arrive Monday for a 7 p.m. engage-
ment and the University of Georgia invades David-
son next Saturday for a 2 p.m. battle.

Parker expects both matches to be evenly match-
ed and hotly contested. The Citadel has beaten de-
fending Southern Conference champion West Vir-
ginia and features Mike Swanda who is conference
champion in the 147-lb. class.

Heavyweight Lowell Bryan is undefeated for the
Davidson frosh team.

Unbeaten Sigs Hand Delts

First IMAC Defeat, 87-64

By NEVILLE PATTERSON
Davidsonian Sports Writer

As IMAC basketball slow-
ly progresses into the sec-
ond half of its painfully-
long season, the perennial
question is again being
asked around Patterson
Court, “Who can stop the
Kappa Sigs and how?”

At this point in the season,
the Kappa Sigs stand 7-0 and
have soundly beaten the Phi
Delts, who are in second place
with a 7-1 record. The Sigma
Chis, in third place, at 7-2, are
well ahead of the fourth place
Independents, who stand at 5-2.

In the game that decided first
place, the Kappa Sigs blistered
the Phi Delts, 87-64. Raymond
Garrison led the winners’ of-
fense and all scorers with 18
points. Stu Burness and Pete
Ort held the boards and pumped
in 15 and 14 points respectively,
while Buddy Dubose added 11.

John Barrow led the Delts
with 16 and was assisted by
Buzzy Parker's 14 and Ronny
Hunt's 13.

The Sigma Chis pulled off a
close one with an upset-minded

Sigma Nu five and came away
with a 66-60 victory. Geordie
Mueller was everywhere and
had the range for 24 points. Joel
Williamson controlled the back-
boards and added 18 points.

Bill Barnette, who was all but
unstopable, led the Nu scoring
with 20 points, and was followed
by Arthur Clark with 17 and Bil!
Childress with 15.

The Pikas handed the high-fly-
ing Independents a decisive de-
feat, 57-46, as Tom White con-
nected for 18 points, Wayne
Mangum found the distance for
12 and Bob O'Kelly came
through with 11.

David Jennings led the Inde-
pendents with 10 points, Boyd
Scott had 9, George Brown 8
and Jim Fuller 7.

Two nights later the Inde-
pendents stormed back to take
the ATO's 75-31. Geoff Birkhead
had 13 points for the ATO’s,
with Rufus Adair adding 8.

The Indies furthered their re-
bound from the Pika loss by
beating the SAB’s 5536.

With a lop-sided 90-34 win
over the Betas, the KA’s proved
that they can shine when play-

ing the proper rival. Grey Win-
field gunned in 22 points, Rich
Harrell hit for 14 and~Robert
Johnson pumped in 10.

Dave Meschan found the bas-
ket for 16 points and Bill Woods
added 6 for the Betas.

The Pikas swept by the hap-
less Betas 44-27. White was up
on the boards and came through
with 14. Buford Norman con-
nected for 9 and O'Kelly added
8.
Sam Gibbs had 9 and Jack
Sherrill 8 for the Betas.

The Kappa Sigs rolled on with
a easy 67-52 victory over the
KA's. Dubose bombed in 16
points, Tommy Reams hit for
12 and Ort had 10.

Sam Grimes managed to mus-
cle in for 15 points, and Win-
field and Renn Gruber assisted
with 13 and 12 points for the
KA cause.

The ATO's started rolling
again with a decisive 63-30 win
over the Sigma Nus. Adair fired
in 26 points and Pat Hubbard
connected for 17 more. A grudg-
ing ATO defense managed to
hold Nu scoring ace Bill Bar-
nette to 6 points, a season low
for him.

Clark had 14 and Bill Child-
ress got 8 but they weren't able
to take up the slack.

A late Pi Kappa surge was un-
able to overtake the Sigma
Chis as the Crusaders went on
to their seventh win. The Sig
front wall acted professional as
Mueller hit for 21 with William-
son and Basil Hicks getting 19
apiece.

Tuck Jones led Pi Kapp scor-
ing with 16, Jim Robinson
gunned in 14, Hal Kernodle hit
for 12 and Charlie Taylor came
through with 10.
