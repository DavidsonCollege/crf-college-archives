MEETING SATURDAY, APRIL 13.

At the regular meeting of the Eu-
menean Society last Saturday night it
was voted to do away with the regular
program and to have the election of the
fall term officers. “he vote was close
for all the officers, particularly so for
the member of the debating council. The
following officers were declared elected:
President, Flinn; Vice-President, Win.
Love; Secretary, Boulware; Treas-
urer, Wm. Love; Debating Council,
McGirt; Reviewer, Potts.

Cousar read a letter from one of the
literary societies of the University of
Alabama, concerning the forming of a
literary union at a conference at  Bir-
mingham, Ala.. on the 29th of — this
month. It was decided to appoint a
committee to confer with the Phi Society
to make a more thorough investigation of
the matter before any definite action is
taken. “he committee as appointed is
composed of J. R. Woods, Cousar and
Bellingrath.

Announcement was made of the de-
bate with Roanoke, Friday, April 19. It
was urged that as many as possible be
present, and help the Davidson debaters
defeat the visitors.

The question ‘for debate in the Phi
Society Saturday was: “Resolved, ‘Vhat
the United States Government should
have control of the coal mines.” ‘The
affirmative was upheld by Stone and
Spence, who argued that government
control is necessary in order. to supply
the demand for the coming year and to
prevent a shortage in fuel, such as oc-
curred during the past winter. ‘he
negative was defended by Wilson and
MeKeithen, who contended that — the
shortage of coal during the past winter
was not due to lack of efficiency in man
agement of the mines but to a back of
cars to move the coal, ‘Phey contended
also that it would be a step toward so-
cialism. “Che judges decided in favor of
the negative.

Morton gave an oration on “The
Money God.” Morrison delivered a
declamation, “Fhe Beginning of Free
Masonry.”

The proposition of joining a union of
literary societies in the South ‘was dis-
cussed and the society finally decided to
leave it to a committee to take the
necessary action.

EUMENEAN SERVICE FLAG.

At a recent meeting, the Fumenean
Society decided to have a service flag
made in honor of her former members
who are now in active service. The flag
will contain a star for every old member
who took an active part in the society
for at least one year, whose dues and
fines were payed up in full at the time
of his entering the service.

The flag will contain some fifty odd
stars which will probably be arranged in
an approprite design. The order has
been given to a reputable concern in At-
lanta, and the flag is expected to be com-
pleted within the next two or three
