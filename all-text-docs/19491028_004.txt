During the past week, two players sustained painful injuries

only ones—just the most recent. Most of these injuries couldn't
be helped, but there have been many cases where unnecessary
roughness, slugging, ete., haven’t helped any.

Illegal blocks, clipping, and slugging and holding in the

injuries nevertheless, Football, even touch football, was meant
to be rough, but it was also meant to be played according to

WILDCAT OF TE

By CHERRY STRIBLING

Bright spot in an otherwise dark
and sad day for the Homecoming
fans Saturday was the brilliant de-
fensive play Henry Wilson.
Henry was all over the field and
must have been in on three-fourths

of

of the tackles. All the adjectives
could be used to describe his play
Saturday, such as “alert, rough,

superb, a real line backer.” Playing
the center slot in a 5-3-2-1, Henry
broke up a good many of the Rich-
running plays and brought
down the heavier Spider backs
time after time shoestring
tackles.

When it to
coming play, Henry seems to have

comes sizing up a
a sixth sense. Big blocking backs
of opposing clubs try to move him
out but somehow he
manages to be the man that bottles
up the potential gain. It’s also not
unusual io see No. 34 pull down a
runner who has tried an end sweep.

Henry not his man,
but when he gets him he usually
gets him way that the op-
posing player knows he's been got.
He’s a Wildeat with plenty of
fight and scrap.

Saturday’s game can doubt that
statement.

Henry keeps in shape during the

Freshman Harriers
Notch First Win

By DICK LILES

The Davidson College Freshman
broke into

cross country team
the win column last ‘week-end
when they, defeated the varsity

squad of Lees-McRae Junior Col-
lege, 22 to 33. The teams competed
over 2.3 miles and Staley of Da-
vidson dashed in first with a 12:23
mark, Sechler, of l.ees-McRae,
eame in second at 12:52. Henry
and Smith, both of Davidson, tied
for third with 13:15 each, and Hol-
lander clinched fifth -with 13:31.
Patterson, Epperson, Bill Smith,
Kepler, and Berry were respective-
ly sixth through tenth. Kepler is
the only Davidson man in the last
named. Davidson got in the first,
third, fourth, fifth and ninth man.

Coach Whittle was very im-
pressed with the team’s win. It was
the first time that the Davidson
frosh had beaten the Lees-McRae
squad, Freshman Kenneth Smith,
tied with Bob Henry for third
place, bested his older brother, Bill,
of Lees-McRae, a former cross
country letterman of Davidson.
Coach Whittle will depend on Tom
Staley, Bob Henry, Kenneth
Smith and Herman Hollander to
get in those first ten places when
the team meets Duke frosh on
November 9.

ence meet. The win makes two vic.
tories in a row for the Presbyterians
against an opening day defeat.

Again leading the Wildcats
the tape was Blake Bradley, who
took first place in the meet. Close
behind Bradley were Tom Stock-
ton, Dave Anderson and Dick
Stockton who finished third, fourth
fifth, For the
second straight the entire
Red and’ Black squad of eight men
had finished before’ Randolph-Ma-
con’s number five man could cross
the finish line, a hard feat made
harder by the absence of “honey-
mooning” Grube from the
team, and giving convincing proof
of the depth and all-around ability
of Coach Whittle’s '49 team.

Boys to be especially commended
for Saturday’s performance are
Bradley and Anderson. For Brad.
ley, it was his first tape-breaking
of the year, although he has been
running very fast times. For An-
derson, it marked the first time in
his career that he has covered the
four-mile course in less than 23
minutes. He finished in 22:55 Sat-
urday, again bettering his previous
efforts as he seems to do each new
trip around the track. Also to be
praised are the Stockton boys.

Washington and Lee might be

likened to the pursuit of the pro-

The picture for the Presbyterians
looms little brighter than it did one
week ago. C. L. Runyan, Hal Mapes
and Bob Sharpe are almost cer-
tainties to miss this one, too, and
the Davyjiglson attack considera-
bly crippled without these sterling
performers, It'll again be Ham
Wade and Rhea Adams at full
for Runyan with wingback Jimmy
Sifford doubling up for punting
chores. Jimmy Fasul is slated to fill
for Sharpe again, as he did credit-
ably all afternoon against the
Spiders, and Bob Turk, another
nice looker in his first appearance,
will hold down Mapes’ post.

At least Coach Charley and staff
can be thankful that Henry Wilson
and Jerry Kiser are not completely
out. Wilson is still suffering from
a back if he and big
Jerry live up to this past Saturday
afiernoon’s nothing
more could be asked.

Bright notes despite the fact that
tailbacks Auburn Lambeth and Cliff
Turner are on the injured list are
found in the fine play turned in by
Carnegie's filler, big Bill McNeely,
and back-from-the-injured-list Dick
