Financial Aid Affected By Budget Cuts

By TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor

President Richard Nixon has
not recommended funding for
several educational programs,
new and old, that bear on the
life of Davidson College.

Although the immediate ef-
fects of the President's cuts
could not be calculated, it was
feared that the college might
lose certain grants for new dor-
mitories, as well as some
federal financial aid for stu-
dents.

“The Higher Education
Facilities Act has been frozen,”
explained College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr., ‘‘and no
new funds will be available if
President Nixon's recom-
mendations are approved.

‘We also stand to lose the fun-
ding of Educational Op-
portunity Grants as well as the
National Direct Student Loans,
as they are in their present
form,’ Spencer stated.

Nixon's requests will not at-
fect the college's endowed
scholarships, but it will affect
students whose federal loans
and grants have already been
granted and maintained. The
telling effect will be on those
who are applying currently for
admission in the fall, since the
President's requests will go into
effect in the fiscal year that
begins July 1. 1973.

The money furnished by the
Work-study programs will not
be affected since the President
recommended that this
program be funded at the
present level.

The President's action has

prompted criticism and
backlash from some
educational lobbies in

Washington. The American
Council on Education, a rather
strong lobby, will work through
its Commission on Federal
Relations to effect a reversal or
at least a compromise.

‘The commission will work to
place highest priority on_ in-
creases totaling $454 million
over the President's budget for
higher education programs of
HEW’s Education Division for
fiscal year 1974. The com-
mission has proposed $286
million for direct student loans.
whereas the Administration
Budget calls for only $5 million.

The administration is trying
to counter the loss of the
Educational Opportunity Grants
by expanding the Basic Op-
portunity Grants. In the long
run the object of financial aid
will shift from middle-income
families to lower-income
families.

Some Davidson students who
now receive these grants would
then probably not qualify.
because a greater degree of
need would have to be demon-
strated.

The effect will be that more
people will qualify for federal

Trustees To Consider Budget
During Special Session Today

By BRUCE MALOY
Managing Editor

The Davidson College Board
of Trustees is breaking
tradition with today's meeting
to approve the budget for 1973-
74. In recent years the trustees
have met only in October and
May.

Vice President for Finance
and Development C. David Cor-
nell explained that “the budget
has never been ready for ap-
proval in October and May was
too late.”

A copy of the tentative budget
was sent to the trustees on Feb.
14 so that they would have a full
week to examine the budget in-
stead of the single night which
they have had in the past.

The Finance and
Management Committee met
with Cornell and Business
Manager Robert Currie yester-
day to discuss the budget and to
prepare the presentation which
will be given to the full mem-
bership of the board later today.
At that time, individual trustees
will have an opportunity to
question the budget and move
that it be changed.

Cornell called the Finance
and Management Committee.
“one of the finest I've ever
worked with.’ Charles F.
Myers Jr., chairman of the
committee is chairman of the
board of Burlington Industries.
Vice Chairman Walter L. Lingle
is the vice president of Proctor
and Gamble; Julien L. McCall
is president of the National City
Bank in Cleveland; and Frank
Matthews is general manager
of Belk-Matthews in Gastonia.
N.C. *I'm glad we've got men
with such experience," added
Cornell.

The budget. Buildings and
Grounds Committee which has
prepared this tentative budget.
held an open meeting earlier
this year to hear requests from
students and faculty for special
attention to certain areas of the
budget.

According to Cornell, “The
committee took into account
every priority that was brought
before it at the open meeting.”
He pointed out that once the
budget has been approved, it
will be changed only for ex-
traordinary reasons.

Davidson To Accept 51 Men,
13 Women On Early Decision

Fifty-one men and 13 women
have been accepted on ‘early
decision’ by Davidson College
for admission in the fall of 1973.

This is the largest group ac-
cepted on early decision by the
college, and the first to include
women since Davidson only
became coeducational a year
ago.
On the early decision plan,
students must complete ap-
plications by Nov. 1 and in-
dicate that they have not ap-
plied to any other colleges and
that they will attend Davidson if
accepted.

Similar plans are in effect at
many other educational in-
stitutions.

‘‘Early decision applicants do
not need exceptional creden-
tials,’ said H. Edmunds White,
director of admissions.

‘We are looking for qualified
students who are certain they
want to attend Davidson. In ad-
dition, there are a number of
prospective students whom we
did not accept for early decision
but who will be reconsidered af-
ter the regular admissions
deadline of March 1.*

Davidson is aiming for a

. freshman class of 360 next fail,

as one step in the college's plan
to increase enrollment from the
present 1100 to 1500 by 1980.

ters which will be brought
before the trustees during
today’s meeting. New trustees
Graeme Keith, Price Gwynn
and James McFarland will be
installed. College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. will
then give a general report and
preview.

The requests the Black
Student Coalition (BSC) presen-
ted to the administration last
October are facing both ob-
stacles and encouragement.

The BSC proposal included
requests for an African studies
program, the addition of a black
professor to the Davidson
faculty, implementation of an
exchange program with black
colleges, and increasing the
enrollment of black students to
150.

The only progress in meeting
these proposals so far has been
the establishment of an ex-
change program with
Morehouse College in Atlanta.
The Administration is also con-
sidering opening up other
colleges to the exchange
program.

“The Administration doesn't
seem as though it's in much of a
rush about the African studies
program,” said Steve Peck,
president of the BSC.

“We received a pile of stuff
from departments telling us
what they offered. Things like
parasitology in the Biology
Department. The Sociology
Department said they could
make a course on criminology
on the blacks.

‘*A lot of the departments just
seem to be making excuses,”
said Peck.

According to Vice President
for Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan Davidson has no in-
tention of implementing an

financial aid, but the individual
stipend will now be much less.
‘We are in a bind about what
to tell the freshmen we will be
admitting next fall.’ stated
William S. Miller, assistant

director of admissions and
financial aid.

**We hope that the federal fun-
ding will’ be maintained at

present level. but we think that
it will probably take on new
forms. The loss of the National
Direct Student loans and the
supplemental opportunity
grants will probably be com-
pensated for by increasing the
Basic Opportunity Grants,"’ he
said. °

African stuqaies program. *‘We
have a transcultural program in
the formulative stages, but it's
not ready to be presented for
approval of the Educational
Policy Committee.”

As seen by Bevan, the trans-
cultural studies would be cour-
ses ‘‘on how to study cultures in
a comparative way,"’ con-
centrating on non-Western
cultures, such as Southeast
Asia, the Middle East, Africa
and including Latin America.

“It’s a question of staffing
and what courses others around
us Offer. It takes time and
money to do it,"’ said Bevan.
“Black studies around the coun-
try are on the way out finan-
cially.”

As for progress in acquiring a
black professor, Davidson
currently has one professor
from Johnson C. Smith Univer-
sity teaching a communications
course.

‘‘We're trying desperately for
a black professor ,"’ said Bevan,
“particularly in the area of
political science and sociology
but we have not been suc-
cessful.

‘*Most of the black professors
are in the northeast and mid-
west. They're not likely to come
to rural North Carolina," he éx-
plained.

A goal of 30 has been set for
black student enrollment for
next year. Currently enrolled at
Davidson are 21 black students,
including two foreign students.

According to Admissions Of-
ficer Larry Barr, about 26-28
blacks have already applied.

‘‘We hope it will go around to
35-45 applicants. So far, ap-
plications from girls have
been running pretty evenly with
the boys,” said Barr.

““We're glad of the goal,”’ said
Peck, ‘‘but we're encouraging
them to go over to get to the one-
tenth of the student body goal
that had been set."

BSC has also presented some
programs and has some plan-
ned for the future.

“We were struck by the lack
of student response for the ‘Jour-
ney into Blackness’ program,
and the Martin Luther King
Day Memorial had very poor
response,’’ Peck said.

A gospel choir from UNCC
will perform March 1. Also
scheduled are films dealing
with black history and black
problems.
