News and Views of Wildcat
Events

By Raymond Lake

The Wildcats raised their percentage of
victories to 50 on their second trip as com-
pared with 40 on their first jaunt, but even
then the trip could hardly be called a success.
It is true that they ended the, season with a
victory, and thus did much better than they
might have done, but the decisive defeat they
suffered at the hands of the Duke Blue

Devils subtracted from the glory of this |

victory and pulled their percentage of vic-
tories on the trip down to 50.

That must have been some game last

Thursday night with the Guilford Quakers. | day after being delayed by inclement weather. |

At the end of the second half the score stood
‘26 to 26, and only in the five-minute extra

period were the Wildcats able to drop in the
two baskets that won the game. We pre- |

dicted inthis column last week that the Da-
vidson team would show some form in the
last game, and they must have shown some
to hold the Quakers down in the last period
on their own court. The Guilford team,
though of course inferior to the larger teams
of the state, is a fast-working and excellent
team for a school the-size of Guilford,

The 1928 baseball season was officially
opened last Friday when Manager Link call-
ed for the candidates to be out on the field
at 3:00 o'clock ready to start the regular
work-outs. A large squad of men turned
out and more are expected to report in the
next few days. Practice has been held every
clear afternoon for the last two weeks or
more under the direction of Captain Dulin.
Comparatively few were coming out until the
official call was issued last Friday, but ‘since
then the number has increased greatly and
regular and systematic work-outs have been
held each afternoon. Several more are ex-
pected to report when spring football is over
to raise the number still more.

When the baseball schedule was announced
some time ago, there were 22 games to be
played, but since then one of these, with
Furman, has been cancelled, leaving a total
of 21 games on the schedule. During the
fall, there was some fear expressed that
Captain Dulin would not be able to play this
year on account of having played some dur-
ing the past summer, However, he will be
able to play in 19 of the 21 games on sched-
ule, there being only two colleges out of the
21 that have rules which will bar him.

The track candidates have not yet been
able to begin their regular workouts on the
track. They have been working out in the
gym or on the field when the weather per-
mitted, under the direction of Captain Curry,
but they have not yet been able to begin their
regular practices. Coach Tex has been work-

Season, and as soon as the weather permits

It will be much better for the team when
practice can be held regularly out on the
field as was shown by the accident which oc-
curred during the work-out in the gym last
Thursday when one of the Freshmen fainted,
fell on the floor and knocked two front teeth
out. The stuffiness of the air in the gym is
said to have partially caused the trouble. *

The Freshmen were not able to end their
season as well as the varsity. After suffer-
ing four defeats on their trip, they returned
to the hill and lost their last game to the
Bingham team on their home floor. The
Freshmen were in the lead during a large
part of the game and it looked as if the
game would end with them in the lead, but
when the final whistle blew, the visitors were
several points ahead. The Wildkittens
fought hard and played well during most of
the game, but they were not able to keep
the lead when they got it. Several mistakes
near the first of the game cost them several
points and may have lost the game for them.
The, Freshman track season will be getting
under way in a few days and perhaps the
yearlings will uncover something in the way
of track material that will overbalance, or at
least counterbalance, their showing . in the

The Davidson College basketball team |

in which they chalked up nine wins and seven
defeats. The ’Cats started off the season by |

Prospects for a winning club are unusually
| bright. Seven members of the 1927 team will
be back in uniform when the Wildcats open
their season on March 23rd against Oak
Ridge. This does not include the twirlers
and receivers named above, and does not take
into consideration the new material that was
produced by the Freshman nine last season.

Ratchford and Johnson, outfielders; Kug-
ler, Dulin, Harrison, Littlejohn and Craw-
ford, infielders, are the varsity men who re-
ported for the initial practice Thursday aft-
ernoon. Among the members of last year’s
Freshman team who are seeking varsity po-
sitions this year are “Tuc” McConnell and
Miller, outfielders; and Parrish and Kugler,
infielders; Hugh Arrowood, gridiron per-
former for several years and one-time high
school diamond star, will be a candidate for
a position on the varsity this spring.

In the program Monday, the coach intro-
duced stiff batting practice. The team was
also put to some infield work.

Two games are slated to open the season

before the Northern trip into Virginia. Im-
mediately following this:trip, two big games
are scheduled: Carolina in Salisbury on
Easter Monday, and the University of Penn-
sylvania here on the following Tuesday.

Davidson Defeats State in Final
Match, Bringing Number of
Victories to Four

With their match at Raleigh Monday
night, the Davidson wrestling ' team
brought to a conclusion a successful sea-
son. Handicapped by the loss of captain
Frierson and the other stars of last year’s
team, the Wildcat grapplers began the
season with rather mediocre prospects.
Under the leadership of Captain “Jeff”
Garrison, however, the team has shown
considerable stamina and ‘ability, and the
results of the season have been much bet-
ter than initial prospects indicated.

Captain Garrison who graduates this
year, led his team to the close of a suc-
cessful season, and proved his ability as

class.
Beginning the season with a rush, the

defeat to the Concord “Y” team. Captain |
Garrison and his men won every, match
except one by falls, the other match being

of the Wildcats.

On January 31, Davidson swamped the
Concord “Y” team for the second time of
the season. The match was an interesting
one fro mthe spectators viewpoint, how-
ever, and furnished frequent thrills for
the fans. Concord did not register a}
fall or decision until the final match, in a
little over nine minutes.

In the third match of the season, on
February 4, the Davidson wrestlers gain-
ed a victory over the University of North
Carolina team by a-score of 13 I-2 to 7 1-2.
The Wildcats -won~—four—of—the-seven
matches and Carolina two, the other be-
ing a draw. All of the matches were won
by a decision, not a single fall being reg-
istered. The six bouts that were won by
one side or the. other required an extra
périod each to decide the match. The

Fresh Five Downed
by Bingham Cadets

Davidson’s Freshman basketeers have play-
ed their last game of a big season. The
last game was with Bingham, and was a
hard-fought battle, the Davidson Wildkittens
displaying their fighting ability but failing to
win at the last moment. The final score was
22-19. For Davidson, Goodson - made the
highest running score, while LePerr scored
the highest for Bingham. The number of
field goals for Davidson was 8, and for Bing-
ham 9.

Under the leadership of their captain, Dean
Rusk, the Wildkittens have won three games,
and most of the other games were lost by
close scores. They have fought hard in
every game and have shown that Wildcat

spirit. Following is a list of the games
played and the scores of each:

Davidson... 27 Oak Ridge ------------ 28
Davidson.. 42 American Trust Co. ---- 14
Davidson.- 50 Paw Creek High ------ 13
Davidson... 19 Wake Forest ---------- 31
Davidson_-. 25 Oak Ridge ----------- 33
Davidson... 24 N. C. State ---------- 37
Davidson_. 26 Wake Forest ---------- 40
Davidsonse+24 = Duke Joss cclec coc ccls 52
Davidson-.19 Bingham -------------- 22

most interesting match of the meet was
in the 145 pound class, when Captain. Gar-
rison of Davidson opposed Captain Ab-
bott of Carolina. Garrison barely missed
getting a decision over his opponent, aft-
er two extra periods had been fought,
missing a decision by only a few seconds.

In the next match February 1, David-
son lost to the Virginia Military Institute
grapplers by a score of 131-2 to 91-2.
The teams were evenly matched, and but
one fall was registered, that coming in the
unlimited class when Christenberry of
Davidson threw Haase of V. M. I. .Flytlie
won over his opponent with a time de-
cision while Captain Garrison’s match re-
sulted in a tie.

On February 25, Davidson met the
strong Duke team in Durham, and bowed
in defeat by a score of 20-3. Victory went
to the Blue Devils by reason of five time
decisions and one fall. Captain Jeff Gar-
rison, winning his» match over Jennings

; of Duke by a time decision, was the lone

scorer for the Wildcats.

In their final match of the season last
Monday night, Davidson won a decisive
victory over the North Carolina State
grapplers at Raleigh. The score, 17-8,
was_the result of time decisions in all
matches but two. Hill won over Day of
State by a fall, while Baker’s match was
forfeited when the Wildcat wrestler was
knocked out, after putting up. a game
fight. This match, the last of the season,
brings the total number of victories to
four, with two losses.
