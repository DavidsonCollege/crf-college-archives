Night Snack Bar Impresario
Tends To The Slater-Starved

BY MIKE HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Feature Writer

After two years the night manager of the snack bar for Slater Food Service, Paul
Black listed as the outstanding feature of all his services “the splendid co-operation
of the Davidson student body in all matters pertaining to the snack bar.”

Black is a veteran of many
years in the food preparation
business, including tours of
duty at the Mayflower, the Hotel
Charlotte, and other points. in
the Southeast. He has been liv-
ing in Charlotte for the past
five years. Married, with one

daughter (16), his home is in
Charlotte and he commutes in-
to Davidson.

Although Black emphasized
that there had been very few
problems—all of them minor—
in his work at Davidson, his
main concern was_ finding

Chess Club Planning
For Radio Tournament

The Chess Club is planning-a two-way radio tourna-

The club has also planned
tournaments with several other
colleges and universities, in-
cluding U.N.C. and Duke, as
well as the Charlotte and Con-
cord chess clubs. It hopes to
participate in an all-state tour-
nament sometime this year.

This is due in large part be-
cause all the equipment in the
kitchens of the Student Union
Cafeteria is owned by Davidson
College. The items, the snack
bar now offer, Black said, could
be changed or increased if
enough of the students felt
strongly enough about the sit-
uation to mention it to him.

Surprisingly enough, Black
commented that worst nights for
business at the snack bar were
during exams. He explained
that while the kitchen was pre-
pared to serve’ anywhere from
three to three hundred students
per night, the number served
food on exam nights is much
closer to three, although coffee
consumption was very high, he
added. :

Once again he came back to
emphasize that his menus were
dependent upon student  de-
sires. A little bit of food agita-
tion might be in order.

reer Carnival

Encourages Placement

BY GEORGE FAIN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

For the next two weeks the “mid-way” of the College Union lobby will be the
scene of Davidson’s First Career Carnival. The hours will be from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.,

Nov. 5-16.

The purpose of the Carnival is
to encourage more registration
for placement. A growing inter-
est in graduate schools, the num-
ber of men who go into family
enterprise, and service obliga-
tions leave few graduates each
year for immediate employment.

Last year, in -a class of ap-
proximately 200, less than 50
students registered for place-
ment, and only seven of these
‘were immediately available for
employment at graduation.

Cereer Carnival is designed
to help the Davidson student
become more aware of indus-
try’s needs and to answer
questions concerning grad-
uate work and service oblige-

tions. I¢ will give students a

chance to learn what oppor-

tunities the companies offer
and what they look for in
liberal arts graduates.

Plans First Issue

Scripts ‘n Pranks Editor Doug
Ackerman announced that the
first issue of the magazine will
be ready immediately after
Thanksgiving holidays,

The editor, in a DAVIDSON |
IAN interview, said that the
deadline for the freshman writ.
ing contest will be Dec. 12. The
award will be “Five dollars and
a coveted position on the staff.”

When asked about response to
the recent request for contribu-
tions, Ackerman replied that he
had received 35 articles. Of
these, he said that 17% were
short stories and 17%, poems.
“There is a very good balance
between the literary and humor-
ous contributions.”

In a reply to a question about
the aims of the magazine, Ack-
erman stated, “We shall contin-
ue our unsullied tradition as a
voice of dissent, truth. and
justice; never lowering our ban-
ners...

— “And though under-manned
at certain positions and usually
matched against tough oppon
ents. in spite of this, and very
often lack of student support.
we almost always manage to
come out with a good record.
And several times in the last
few years, we have pulled off
extraordinary upsets. The Wil-
liam and Mary game was almost
one of these.”

will be set up in the Union lob-
by where freshmen, sophomores,
juniors, and seniors are invited
to stop and talk with represen-
tatives from the various indus-
tries.
it is hoped that the repre-
sentatives will also eat lunch
st various fraternity houses
and thus give students an-
other chance for informal

“business talk.”

A tentative list has been pre-
pared for next week. On Mon-
day representatives from Travel-
ers Insurance Co. and the Geo-
logical Survey will be here.
Olin Matheson, North Carolina

National Bank, and Liberty Mu- |

tual Insurance Co. will be here
on Tuesday.

Southern Bell. Fieldcrest,
Citizens and Southern Bank,
Equitable Insurance Co., Insur-
ance of North America, and the
National Aeronautics and Space

j Administration are sending rep-

‘resentatives on Wednesday. On
Thursday. 1B.M., J. & G., Bur-
lincton, and Federal Reserve
representatives. will be present
while Friday will feature Bur-
roughs and Deering-Milliken.
Mr C. Shaw Smith, Placement
Director, has expressed high

hopes for this experiment, and
he is anxious for the Davidson
students to make full use of this
opportunity.

Todd Will Increase
‘Photos For Annual

Work on the 1962-63 Quips
and Cranks is ‘‘progressing very
well.” according to Editor Hal
| Todd.
' The color pictures have been
taken, retakes were made this
past Wednesday. and the cover
selection has also been made.
Todd cites as areas of special
mention the activities section
and the photographic work.

‘The activities section is shap-;

| ing up better than the other sec-
tions, primarily because the
areas éncompassed in it are
more organized." He also prais-
ed the photography, predicting
that “the quality will be great-
ly above the average.” Photo-
graphy Editor Ted Scarboro and
| Photographer Marty Lafferty
are primarily responsible for
this, says Todd.
The number of pictures, both
‘in black and white and in color,
will be increased this year.

Debate Team Splits
Dixie Tournament

. The Davidson Debating Team
broke even in the Dixie Debate
Tournament held at Drury Col-
lege October 27. About twenty
colleges were represented in-
cluding Duke, Wake Forest, Uni-
versity of Florida, Agnes Scott,
and Vanderbilt, whose team won
the tournament,

Bob Llewellyn and Harry
Daniels, arguing for the David-
son affirmative team, won three
rounds out of six; Skip Jones
and Bill Brown for the negative
had the same results giving the
team a fifty-fifty record for the
entire match.

These results, according to
Mrs. H. T. Lilley, assistant de-
bating coach, are actually very
good “considering the caliber
of the other teams represented.”
Mrs. Lilley also mentioned that
this season’s topic, “Resolved:
that the non-communist nations
of the world should form an
economic community,” is a
very difficult one requiring
much detailed study. “Further.
more,” she added, “there were
many schools whose teams won
only one or two out of twelve
rounds.”

This weekend will test the
skill of Davidson’s Freshman
Debating Team. As the plans
now stand the affirmative team
of Jim Curl and George Kuy-
kendall with Bill Pierce, Albert
Keizer, and Hank Taylor as the
negative team will represent
Davidson at the Annual Novicé
Debate Tournament at Wake
Forest.

everyone will play four matches.
Each of the 16 participants will
be ranked according to his posi-
tion in the tournament. One of
the puropses of the tournament
will be to set up ranks for com-
ing intercollegiate matches.

The results of the second
match are as follows: Bob Mill-
er, Jesse Lynn, and Chester

Wilkinson have not yet played
their second match.)

The championship game will
be held in the Union about three
weeks from now. It will be
open to the public.

President Bob Miller encour-
aged all who are interested in
chess to come to the meetings.
He said, “No expert knowledge
of chess is necessary, and we
feel that everyone can benefit
from the discussion.”

The meetings consist of stud-

techniques. The club will have
several: outside speakers and
some films at future meetings.
There is equipment at the Union
desk for both regular and five-
minute chess.

Ashlin White Bible Lectures in ‘memory of the ‘pastor who served the congregation

from 1921 to 1941. These lectures are designe

“to be non-denominational and are

for all who are interested in discussion of themes of the Bible.”

Staff Warren, chairman of the
Union Game Committee, said
that he hoped a regular sched-
ule could be arranged, with
tournaments either bi-monthly
or every three weeks.

The Union Game Committee
was also in charge of the fresh-
man ping-pong and _ billiards
tournaments held earlier this
year. Other ping-pong and bil-
liards tournaments will be held
inapproximately two weeks. The
entire student body will be
eligible. The list of winners will
be placed on a challenge board,
and challenge matches will be
held throughout the year.

think it should be stated in such
a way that there will. be no
question as to the meaning of

senior. .

“And I feel the students ought
to organize into a group .. . and
present our opinions on the
question,” added Carolyn Har-

One student cited the rules of
other southeastern women's col-
léges: “Hollins serves a limited
amount (of alcohol) at its social
functions like the Hollins Cotil-
lion.

Converse allows girls to drink
during off-campus weekends,
but not after sunrise on the day
they return to Concerse. Ran-
dolph-Macon allows drinking
outside a 20 mile radius from
the school.”

The current punishment for
the most recent violators of the
rule is a six-week period of no
dates on or off campus after
7 p.m. Council President Nisbet
emphasized that, presently, each
offender is considered as a sep-
erate case. Some campus penal-
ties have involved a length of
nine weeks.

EAT, SLEEP, AND MATRICULATE

The trouble with early morning classes is that you're too sleepy.
At late morning classes you're too hungry. At early afternoon
classes you're too logy. At late afternoon classes you're too
hungry again. The fact is—and we might as well face it—there
is no good time of day to take a class.

What shall we do then? Abandon our colleges to the ivy? I
say no! I say America did not become the hope of mankind and
the world’s largest producer of butterfate and tallow by running
away from a fight!

If you’re always too hungry or too sleepy for class, then Ict’s
hold claases when you’re not too hungry or sleepy: namely, when
you're eating or sleeping.

Classes while eating are a simple matter. Just have a lecturer
lecture while the eaters eat. But watch out for noisy food. I
mean who can hear a lecturer lecture when everybody is crunch-
ing celery or matzo or like that? Serve quiet stuff—like anchovy
paste on a doughnut, or steaming bowls of lamb fat.

And kindly observe silence while lighting your post-prandial
Marlboro Cigarette. Don’t be striking kitchen matches on yout

jeans. Instead carry an ember from the dormitory fireplace in
your purse or pocket. Place the Marlboro against the ember.
Light it quietly. Smoke it quietly. Oh, I know I ask a great
deal! I know that one’s natural instinct upon encountering
Marlboro’s fine flavor and filter is to throw back one’s head and
bellow great, rousing cries of joy. But you must not. You must
contain your ecstacy, lest you disturb the lecturing lecturer.
You can, if you like, permit yourself a few small shudders of
pleasure as you smoke, but take care not to wear garments
which will set up a clatter when you shudder—like taffeta, for
example, or knee cymbals.

let us turn now to the problem of learning while sleeping,
Tirat, can it be done?

Yes, it can. Psychologists have proved that the brain is
definitely able to assimilate information during sleep. Take, for
instance, a recent experiment conducted by a leading Eastern
university (Stanford). A small tape recorder was placed under
the pillow of the subject, a freshman named Glebe Sigafoos.
When Glebe was fast asleep, the recorder was turned on. Softly,
all through the night, it repeated three statements in Glebe’s
slumbering ear:

1. Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 109 and is called “The
Founder of English Eclectic Philosophy.”

2. The banana plant is not a tree but a large perennial herb.

3. The Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in 1914 at

Sarajevo by a young nationalist named Mjilas Cvetnic, who has.

been called “The Trigger of World War I.”

When Glebe awoke in the morning, the psychologists said to
him, ‘Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 109. What is he
enlled?”

Glebe promptly replied, “Perennial Herb.”

Next they asked him, “What has Mjilas Cvetnic been called?”

Replied Glebe, ‘Perennial Serb.”

Finally they said, “Is the banana plant a treo?”

But Glebe, exhausted from the long interrogation, had fallen
back asleep, where he is to this day. © 1002 Mas Shulman

° e e

Glebe sleeps, but you, we trust, are up and about, Why not .

improce each waking houf with our fine product—Marlboro
Cigarettes? You get a lot to like—Alter, flavor, pack or box.

Dr. Robshaw will visit David-
University of Edinburgh, Prince- son Thursday, Nov. 8 and will
ton Theological Seminary, and deliver the
Temple University in Philadel- Thursday morning.
