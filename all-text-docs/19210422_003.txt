He Who Laughs Last Laughs Best.

Don’t try to crawfish, you fellows who
cut Mitchell's mustache off. Today is
the day that you are expected to pay a
round $25 for the assault and battery.
However, don’t run around any more
like you have been doing for the past
week scared to death for fear you will

all be arrained in court. The joke is all!

‘on you, for the assaulted one never had
any intentions of suing you.

*And to think that “Crack” Brown
wrote home to get advice about paying
up. And “Red” Smith was only willing
to pay $1250 being as only half of it
was cut off. And now Romefelt, McFad-
den, and C. K. Brown will sleep well.

Hard luck, fellows.

MINISTERIAL BAND OFFICERS
FOR FOUR MONTHS ELE

The Ministerial Band held its regular
| meeting for the election of new officers
on last Sunday afternoon. J. I. Knight
‘22,,was chosen president; T. L. Frasef,
‘23, vice-president, and G. M. Moryéw,
‘24, secretary. The meeting w,
voted mainly to the elections; and the
program was dispensed with on this
account. The new officers are men
whose interest is in the task at hand,
and a very successful year’s work under
their direction is expected by all the
members.

INTERESTING SERVICE OF
VOLUNTEER BAND HELD

On last Tuesday evening the Volunteer
Band held a very impressive meeting in
the Sunday School room of the church.

Although only about two dozen members ;

and a half-dozen visitors were present,
there was plenty of interest in the
meeting and the singing was especially
good.

Harold Moss read as the Scripture les-
son the fifth chapter of Romans, begin-
ning with that famous verse: “Therefore
being justified by faith we have peace
with God through our Lord Jesus
Christ.” After the Scripture lesson and
prayer Wigs Bradford read a very in-
teresting and enlightening letter from
Plumer Smith, one of Davidson’s toyal
alumni, who is now working in Mutoto,
in the Congo Mission in Africa.

The Band then received the reports
from the two deputations sent out on
the preceding Sabbath:* Junebug Price
and P. D. Miller, from the First and
Second Churches of Salisbury, and Ted
Jones and Jap Cumming from Sharon
and Carmel Churches, near Charlotte.
The reports of this phase of the Band’s
work were extremely gratifying and en-
couraging.

After a circle of sentence prayers, the
meeting broke up with the usual friendly
handshake.

BIBLE CLASS ATTENDANCE
SHOWS MARKED INCREASE

The attendance at the dormitory Bible
Classes last Sunday morning was 138
with the mission study classes raising
this amount to about 175. This was
nearly 100 per cent increase over the
Sunday before, but there is stil! room
for improvement. The classes are not
long, only about 30 minutes, and this
time can easily be spared by every one.
The mission study classes, led by Major
Hearn and Dr. Arbuckle in the Library,
are especially beneficial. Every one is
cordially invited to come and take part.

INSTALLATION OF NEW “Y”

OFFICERS SUNDAY EVENING

Next Sunday evening, April 24th, at
(the regular meeting of the “Y,” the new
officers and cabinet for the coming year
will be formally installed. There will be
no elaborate ceremony, but the president
hopes to have every member of both the
old and the new organizations seated on
, the two front benches, and the old men
will at this time turn over their duties
and responsibilities to the new men.

Four short talks will make up the
main part of the program. Lewis
Schenck and Buck Curry will give a few
parting words of advice, while J.P.
Price and Pat Crawford will outline in
general the work that the “Y” hopes to
carry out next year. Special music will
be furnished for the service by Ed. Cun-
ningham.

MITCHELL COLLEGE
GLEE CLUB PRESENTS
PLEASING PROGRAM

Young Ladies and Director Render
Worth-while Entertainment.

“Enough to set a fellow wild.” That
was the universal verdict of the audience
at the close of the concert given by the
Glee Club of Mitchell College in Shearer
Hall on last Monday evening. The bevy
of beautiful girls, coupled with the har-
mony which they so successfully pro-

duced, rendered the occasion a tremen-
dous success,

One of the first as well.as the best of
the numbers was the solo of Miss Mar-
ion Moore, in “Thank God for a Gar-
den.” She certainly made one thank
God for her when she responded to the
applause in a successful encore, “Il Love
You.” .

The reading, “The Going of the White
Swan,” given by Miss Estelle Brown,
was very effective and the audience
could almost see the frozen land of
Labrador, and the little log cabin where
the scene was laid. Her encore was
“The Courtin’” a fanciful bit of humor.

The solo work as well as the charm-
ing appearance of Miss Aileen Terry
made her part of the program very en-
joyable and interesting, to say the least
of it. ; :

The whole Glee Club gave several
songs en masse of which the most ap-
pealing were “Ching-a-Ring,” “Feather
Your Nest,” “Irene” and “Margie.”

Mr. Adrian Wynnobell, the director of
the club, sang in his deep and powerful
voice a Rarrack-Room Ballad of Kip-
ling’s. He was repeatedly encored and
received the best hand of the evening.

In closing the club sang “Herc's* To
Our Alma Mater,” a Mitchell College
song, in such an effective way as to
bring regret to the minde of every one
that one of the most enjoyable occasions
of many moons was over.

PRE-EMINENT IMPORTANCE
OF SOUL

(Continued from page 1)
this problem: “What shall it profit a
man, if he gain the whole world and

‘lose his own soul?” The student finally

solved it by becoming a Christian and
leading many others into the path of
peace.

Dwight closed his talk by saying that
when we once realize the supreme im-
portance of the soul, we will need no
urging to cultivate it: that we will feed
it upon God’s Word, bring it into the
sunshine of God's presence, and exer-
cise it in deeds of kindness and good
will,

WAKE FOREST SECURES
CLOSE DECISION

(Continued from page 1)

found the Wake Forest men nice fel-
lows and had a pleasant fellowship with
them. The Meredith College girls, and
the others present at the debate, were
very generous with their applause to
both sides, and the Davidson men were
roundly congratulated for their fine de-
bate, quite a number of people coming
up on the platform to shake hands be-
fore the fellows had time to come down.
The fellows regretted that the dean of
Meredith could not let her girls stay
downstairs longer, for things were just
getting real interesting when the cur-
few rang.

A hearty word of appreciation for the
work of the alternates is due. Mr. Mon-
teith, of Wake Forest, and Dwight Mill-
er, of Davidson, left no detail unattend-
ed to that would make for the success of
the debate or for the comfort and satis-
faction of the debaters. P. D. Q. was
right there with the old pep and pulling
for old D C. with a hearty good will.
He did much to strengthen the team that
went against Wake Forest.
