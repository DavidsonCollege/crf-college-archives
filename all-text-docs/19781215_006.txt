Famed actress comes
here in early January

By DR JOSEPH GARDNER ~
Professor of Drama *
Every December I see a film
called Broken Blossoms. It was
directed by D.W. Griffith in
1919, and I select it for my film
course as an example of his best
work.

Every year, however, I am
more convinced of how much
this film depends upon the
sparkling performance of its
leading actress, a 19-year-old
girl named Lillian Gish.

Andrew Sarris, during his
recent visit to the cdmpus,
referred to Gish as one of the
five or six greatest screen
actresses of all time. Sad to
think that nowadays she is
more familiar to critics like Sar-
ris, students of film, and to
those who saw her films in the
Teens and Twenties. Not that
she hasn't remained active. She
still makes an occasional ap-
pearance, most recently in Rob-
ert Altman’s 1 Wedding. But

the silent film was her real

legendary proportion. The im-
age is unforgettable: golden
hair, shining with more rad-
iance than any studio lamp
could have provided, the slen-
der, girlish body, the pouting,
cupid’s-bow mouth, and most of
all the eyes, clear and wide and
bright and innocent.

And the real Miss Lillian is
even more beautiful than the
image. She was respectable yet
independent when actors were
placed somewhere. beneath
chimney-sweeps on the social
scale. She is an‘avid reader, and
still considers herself a ‘‘ear-
ner’. She is a woman of culture,
a truly civilized human being, a
lady. In short, Lillian Gish is an
American institution: .

I remember seeing her on the

Griffith's birth. She was instru-
mental in having a commemora-
tive postage stamp issued in his
honor. I was overwhelmed by
her energy, lucidity, charm, and
yes, her great beauty. It’s
almost unbelievable that in a
few short weeks she'll be here
among the mortals.

Shaw Smith and William
Brown deserve the credit for
making it possible with this
year’s exciting Artist Series.
Now it’s our turn. Miss Lillian
is unique. It’s rare enough to
see her on the screen, during
those moments of magic in
which life is created out of light
and shadow. Much rarer is the
opportunity to have her here in
person.
