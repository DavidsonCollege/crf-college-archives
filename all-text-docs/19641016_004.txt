said MacDonald. “You encoun-

Conservatives Elect
Campbell President

Davidson's Conservative Club,
reorganized this year with Dan
Campbell as its president, has
planned a year of intensive
study wifh panel discussions,
outside speakers and various
other programs to supplément
its activities.

Officers elected last week
at the club's first meeting of
the year were Campbell, presi-
dent; Billy Clark, vice-presi-
dent; Louis Lesesne, secretary;
and Butch Allison, treasurer.

According to Campbell, this
year’s projects will include
sponsoring panel discussions,
securing outside speakers, en-
couraging student awareness of
the political life of America
and possibly compiling a K-
brary of pertinent reference
materials.

The program for next Tues-
day’s meeting will be a panel

| discussion among several news-

papermen from Charlotte and
surrounding towns who will
discuss and analyze the role of
the press in political polling
and. reporting.

The Davidson Conservatives
belong to the Intercollegiate
Society of Individualists, which
supplies literature and speakers
to its members throughout the
year. As such, the local is not
permitted to engage in political
activism and will consequent-
ly not campaign as a club for
any candidate.

The purposes of the Con-
servative Club, as stated in
its charter, are to encourage
participation in politics, to
discuss and evaluate political
theories, to stimulate political
awareness on the campus, to

students, one from Drexel In-
stitute and the other doing a
field study for a degree in
social work for UNC.

The Davidson graduate had
to take the State Merit Exam
in making application for his
position.

‘Although the salary isn’t
great ($90 per week),” report-
ed MacDonald, “the agency
does have a program that will
send you to graduate school
in social work. The Charlotte
welfare program is among the
most advanced in the nation.”

Most of his case work is with
women from 25 to 30. Said
MacDonald, “The dependent
mothers with whom I work are
frequently surprised to speak
with a male social worker;
also’ they aren't used to any
of the social amenities — such
as being addressed as Mrs... .”

Donald by the welfare office
consists of the neighborhood

Populating the world of Walt
MacDonald are violence, pain
and the nebulous misery of
“hard core” poverty. He sees
the face of the pre-teenage
girl who has just been mistreat-
ed by her father; he sees the
untended burns of a young boy
who was assumed unhurt “be-
cause he didn't cry.”

But even this world is not
without its occasional dignity.
Reported MacDonald, “A wom-
an called the other day to tell
me her husband had just been
released from jail and that
I should cut off the welfare
checks. If she had said nothing,
she would probably have con-
tinued to receive the money
for two or three months.”

It has been written that “We
can always find the inner
strength to bear the misfor-
tunes of others.” Such easy
cynicism, MacDonald is. finding,
belongs to a world other than
his own.

HAPPY HOMECOMING!
