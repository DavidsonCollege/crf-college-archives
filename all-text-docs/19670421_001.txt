this was untrue. “They made nro
comment about our reputation.”

He said that they were only
apprehensive about Davidson's

‘Wires will wear out’’ was the
way Grover Meetze summarized
the power failure which occur-
red about 5 a.m. Saturday morn-
ing during Spring Frolics.

Meetze, director of the phys-
ical plant, said that the break
occurred behind Belk dorm in
an unshielded line about 12 years
old. He said that the voltage is
higher now than it was then,
and that due to electrical charg-
es, the insulation broke down
and shorted out the line.

This was ‘not uncommon.”
Meetze said. and that the col-
lege is in the process of replac-
ing older unshielded lines with
the shielded type.

Other than the power failure
the consensus of opinion was that
Frolics was a success. Speaking
of the power failure. Mrs. Peter

Nicholts, dormitory supervisor.
said that she was wondering
what the next disaster was go-
ing to be. but that they man-
aged well with candles.

Mrs. Nicholls said that things
“‘went quite well’ and that the
general decorum was good. ‘‘Stu-
dents and dates were in better
céntrol of themselves."’ She said
that Frolics attendance was
smaller than usual.

C. Shaw Smith. director of the
College Union, reported that at-
tendance for the concerts by The
Association and Dave Brubeck
was good.

Smith said the Union this year
had “found that a lot of people
are interested in programs on
campus if they are novel. and
top notch.”*

at Davidson is made up of pri-

Faculty,
Students
Listen

Students got a chance to listen
in on faculty discussion .on pro.
posals for an honors college and
a non-Western studies program
at an open faculty meeting Mon-
day.

Dean of the Faculty Frontis
W. Johnston. chairman of the
Blue Sky Committee, which has
been working on curriculum
changes, presented the commit-
tee's two proposals which were
discussed.

The first proposal was for the
establishment of an honors col-
lege. It was estimated that the
college would be comprised of
35-60 students and between four
and six faculty members.

Students with a high degree of
what Johnston called ‘“intellec-
tual ability and emotional ma-
turity’’ would be selected to par.
ticipate in the program.

‘They would participate on a
part-time or full-time basis. ac-
cording to their needs and abil-
ities. Under the direction of the
professors, they would pursue
independent study.

The report said. and Johnston
reiterated, that there would be
“no dishonor’ associated with
leaving the program at the end
of a year or a semester if it
would be in the best interests of
the student.

Participating students would
be “relieved of all normal aca-
demic requirements." .

The report stated that the pur

“ pose of the proposal was to

“challenge our best students and
. to attract top-flight stu-
dents” to the college.

Johnston said that the honors
college proposal was based on
the belief that ‘each year there
is a handful of students whose
needs go beyond our present pro-
gram.”

He. added that there are ‘‘dif
ferent requirements for different
students. This program will be
very flexible — tailored to the
needs of the individual student.”

Johnston also stated that ‘‘one
fourth or one-third or one-sixth
or all’ of a student's work could ,
be in honors, depending on his
‘*needs, ability and motivation.”

The report recommended rota-
tion of service for the faculty to
assure greater faculty partici:
pation.

The second proposa) dealt with
the establishment of a program
,of non Western studies.

Johnston said. “Some expo

Student Activity In Blue Sky
Considered To Be Successful

By BOB TRAVERS
Associate Editor

Student participation in Blue

very active and proved quite
successful, according to several
of those students who served on
such subcommittees.

In talking with THE DAVID

ideas which they would not have
been introduced to had the com
mittees been composed of fac-

bringing the will of the students
to the faculty.’’ explained Bob

ODK Taps 12 New Members

Twelve students and three fac-

morning for membership in Om-

‘Most students would find them-

He added that colleges must
