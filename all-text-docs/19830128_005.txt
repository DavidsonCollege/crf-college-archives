Rock and Roll Infested by Sin

(CPS)-Rock ’n’ roll is getting some
hard knocks on campuses from coast to
coast from Bible-waving, record-burn-
ing evangelists warning students of
what Anthony, for one, calls music’s
“Satanic influence.”

Almost out of the blue last term, the
preachers began showing up on cam-
puses everywhere.

Georgia evangelist Billy Adams,
for instance, has destroyed over
$200,000 in rock vinyl “because it
preaches the use of drugs, illicit sex, the
occult, and rebellion.”

Adams _ preaches on campuses
throughout the South, often playing
AC/DC, Kiss, and The Beatles to prove
his point.

Jed Smock, perhaps the dean of the
campus circuit riders, has recently
added rock ’n’ roll to his already-impas-
sioned anti-sex and drugs sermons at
schools from Virginia to Kentuckyto
new Mexico State.

None of the anti-rockers have
trouble drawing crowds. Some evange-
lists have even enjoyed bigger crowds
by specializing in the evils of rock.

Nick Pappis, a “Christian record

producer” from Florida, conducts col-
lege discussions about musicians using
symbolism and subliminalism to “brain-
wash” listeners.

Many album covers, pappis ex-
plains, show occult symbols like penta-
grams, pyramids, and broken crosses
that can coerce young people into evil

The Electric Light Orchestra, Black
Oak Arkansas and other groups, he
charges, use backward masking—te-
cording messages backward on a re-
cord—to convey demonic urges to un-
wary listerners.

“Another One Bites the Dust” bv

Queen, pappis says, actually says “Sa-
tan must have no limit” when portions
of it are played backwards.

Greg Anthony contends the Rolling
Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” and
“Dancin’ with Mr. D.,” in addition to
songs by Led Zeppelin and AC/DC, are
similar “tributes to Satan.”

“Stairway to Heaven” sounds like
“My sweet Satan, no other made a path,
for it makes me sad, whose power is Sa-
tan” when played in reverse, Anthony
claims.

“We’re concerned not only with the
lyrics and album covers, but also with
the lifestyles of the musicians and their
intentions,” says Dan Peters, who along

with his two brothers lectures students
about rock ’n’ roll.

“Many of the rock musicians today
enjoy singing about things that are im-
moral and illegal, such as drugs and sex.
The Village People, for instance, have
poublicly said that they want to make
gay people more acceptable through
their music.”

No one is precisely sure why the
anti-rock crusades have appeared now.

“I guess it’s an offshoot of the New
Right and various fundamentalist Chris-
tian movements that have become popu-
lar recently ,” says George Ward of Bo-
wling Green University’s Center for the
Study of Popular Culture.

“I can see where a lot of people-
—particularly fundamentalist Christi-
ans—might say rock ’n’ roll is offen-
sive, but it’s a long way to say that
there’s some kind of plot to convert peo-
ple to Satan through music.’

“And as far as little devils and de-
monic signs on the album jackets go,”
says Warner Records spokesman Bob
Merlis, “you can see them, so how
could they be secret attempots to brain-
wash people.”

The scholarship will allow students
to leave Davidson for private lessons,

study abroad, or participation in sum-

mer music programs.

“There will be as many different
ways of spending the money as there are

scholarship holders,” said Powers.
The money can be used to pay tui-

tion, and recipients will still be eligible

for financial aid.

A committee acting under the au-
thority of the Admissions and Music de-
partments will select the recipients and

make further clarifications concerning

the scholarship.

Powers feels that the Plott Scholar-
ship will give Davidson an “opportunity
to have a string orchestra.”

Although none of the money will be
used to improve the music department
itself, College Union Director Shaw
Smith believes that the Scholarship may
have.“‘secondary effects.”

He admits that “Davidson couldn’t
possibly afford a conservatorium” but
he thinks the scholarship will generate
more interest in music.

Davidson started promoting the
concert last September. The department
of development sent out brochures to
alumni, parents, friends of the college,
and business leaders.

The College also promoted the con-
cert at alumni meetings.

New York Philharmonic oboist Jo-
seph Robinson ’62 was also instrumen-
tal in raising funds for the scholarship.

big,” according to Smith.
Concert History

The Donald Plott Memorial Concert
was originally planned as an Artist Ser-
ies event but it “got to growing,” said
Smith. Mrs. Louise Martin, the widow
of former College President David Grier
Martin, chatted with Workman and Ro-
binson two years ago about the possibil-
ity of bringing them back to Davidson to
perform.

A year later the Trustees decided to
award honorary degrees to Robinson
and Workman. The concert organizers
then scheduled the event so that it coin-
cided with convocation.

Director of the Atlanta Symphony
Robert Shaw was supposed to conduct
the performance, but he backed out.
Smith says Robinson exclaimed, “Zub-
in will come!”

Robinson got Mehta to come as well
as co-workers Karl Haas and An-
nouncer for the New York Philharmonic
Martin Bookspan. He also promoted the
concert wherever he went.

“Joe was the moving spirit,”
Smith.

Robinson put together the orchestra
with aid from Concertmistress and
former Davidson music professor
Elaine Richey and William Lawing *73.

Besides Robinson and Workman,
Davidson Alumni Stephen B. Shipps
78, David Edwards ’61, and William
Lawing ’73 also performed in the con-
cert.

said

Steve Gray ’82 sang bass in Sun-
day’s convocation.

Davidson students also performed at
convocation. Jane Redd ’84 and Neal
Biggers ’83 played organ; Elizabeth
Herron °*83 performed on the horn;
Joyce Robinson ’83 sang mezzo-sopra-
no; and Hendrick van Deventer ’85
blew the trumpet. Laura McDonald
drew enthusiastic applause for interpre-
tation of a Brahms rhapsody.

The program for convocation also
featured pieces by Bach, Mozart, and
Beethoven.

The Plott Concert’s all-Bach pro-
gram included Cantatas 50, 56, and 82
and the Sinfonia for Oboe, Strings and
Continuo from the “Easter Oratorio.”

Mehta replaced Leonard Bernstein
as music director of the New York Phil-
harmonic five years ago, after 16 years
as music director of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic. He also serves as music
director of the Israel Philharmonic, and
he occasionally guest conducts such
world-class orchestras as the Berlin
Philharmonic, the Orchéstre de Paris
and the Philadelphia Orchestra.

Robinson joined the New York
Philharmonic as principal oboist in
1978 after six seasons as principal with
the Atlanta Symphony. He is a former
faculty member of the North Carolina
School of the Arts in Winston-Salem,
and he was also first oboist with the
Piedmont Chamber Orchestra and the
Clarion Wind Quartet.

He graduated from Davidson Phi
Beta Kappa with a major in English.

Workman, also an English major,
went on to earn a diploma in voice per-
formance from the Curtis Institute of
Music in Philadelphia. He joined the
Hamburg State Opera in 1965 and as-
sumed his present position in 1975.
Workman has sung with opera compan-
ies around the world.

Donald B. Plott died in 1981 while
serving in his thirtieth year on the Da-
vidson College faculty. He directed the
nationally recognized Davidson Col-
lege Male Chorus for 29 years and the
Oratorios Singers of Charlotte for 20
years, leaving behind him a legacy of
musicians as widely dispersed as David-
son’s alumni.
