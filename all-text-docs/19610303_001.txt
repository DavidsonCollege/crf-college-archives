_ What is next for the crumbling brick building that has housed slaves, a mis-
sionary-minded widow out to save sinful students, and presently laundry soap? The}
college is now searching for some new use “fitting” to the historic buildings past. |

This little house, which stands
next to the college laundry, was
built before the Civil War to
house servants for the “Spar-
row’s Nest.” A certain Mr.
Sparrow, one of the prominent
citizens of early Davidson, had
built his home on the lot next to
the present site of Richardson
Dorm.

FOUR DAUGHTERS

He had four attractive daugh-
ters who managed to charm a
goodly portion of the nearby
student body. It became the
fashion of the young men to
visit the Sparrow home. In time,
things got so cozy that the place
was fondly spoken of as the
“Sparrow's Nest.” All four of
the girls, incidently, managed to
marry Davidson men.

today at the back of Belk.

As time went on, the “Spar
row's Nest” slipped out of the
hands of the family. It became
ene of the cheapest boarding
houses in Davidson. A student
could eat there for $18 a month
many a student, finding
himself in a financial pinch
took his meals at the “Trough.”

RELIGION, BEER

Sparrow’s little brick house
continued to see several uses
during these years. Perhaps the

| strangest of all occurred when

the college somehow began
sponsoring a widow who took up
residence there. It became her
business to sleep there at night
and to sally forth in the daytime
giving out religious tracts to
the students.

Presently, it serves as a store-
room for the college laundry.

Davidsonian Feature Writer

It is filled with sacks of pow-
dered soap, machinery parts and

bottles of various shapes.

Although the building has
been redone several times since
the 1860's, it still apears to be
crumbling away. Huge cracks
are visible and new brick sup-

perts weak spots.

WHAT NOW?

The big question is what’s to
become of it now. Robert Currie,
college business manager, says
that the section between the
laundry and Richardson is due
for a beauty treatment this

this spring. Probably the oldthe old building.
