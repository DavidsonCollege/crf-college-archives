| Chet Brings Taste of France to Depot Street

By Yvette Pita

Henri Ducluzeau was only
eighteen years old when he won an
apprenticeship in Les Trois
Faisans, one of the top restaurants
in France in 1928. Now, at 77, he
is the head chef of his family-
operated restaurant with the same
name located on Depot Street
across from the Davidson College
computer center. He works sur-
rounded by his family: his wife,
Lusa, his 22 year-old son, Lionel,
and Lionel’s fiancee, Inga Rudin.

Entering the restaurant, it is
hard notto notice several honorary
culinary certificates that indicate
that he: has been a member of
Chevaliers du Tastevin (a brother-
hood of wine tasters), the French
Culinary Academy, and the
Commaderie des Cordons Bleu.
According to his son, Lionel, “He
has several others, but he doesn’t
want to put them up.” One senses
Hemri’s family connection as his
son sits next to him and helps him
with his English while he begins
the story of his life. Lusa contin-
ues to serve the customers. The
depth of Henri’s eyes reveal his
history and strong character.

His story begins in France with
his apprenticeship at Les Trois
Faisans. Henri later became the
youngest chef with twenty others
below him at another restaurant in
Besancon. By the age of twenty,

he was the head chef at the palace
in Chamonix located in the Alps.
In 1940, at the age of 22, Henri
was sent by the Culinary Society
of Paris to be the executive chef of
the Regina Hotel in Mont D’Or.
He chuckles as he says, “When I
arrived, the manager said, ‘You’re
not the chef! You’re a boy. We’ll
make you an assistant, and call the
Society tomorrow.’” As Henri sits
back in his seat, he continues, “He
gave me hard time, and tried to
make me prepare difficult desserts,
butI was able to dothem.” He then
adds, “And ‘we didn’t have those
frozen things we have today.”
During World War II, Henri
owned a restaurant-hotel called Le
Lion d’Or. “In 1942, I was ar-
rested by the Gestapo...” Lionel
adds, “...because he was amember
of the resistance.” Henri contin-
ues, “I was told not to talk or I
would be shot. I was also badly
beaten. You can still see some of
the marks on my left knee.” Henri
was under house arrest for 300 and
a half months before he sold his
restaurant ten days before General
Gavin stormed the beaches at
Normandy and freed France.

‘Shortly after he gained his ~

freedom his wife became ill. “She
developed breast cancer, and
passed away.” Lionel touched his
father’s arm. Henri paused a mo-
ment and continued.

After serving as the executive
chef at another hotel, Henri was
notified that he would be moving
to Washington D.C. to work at the
French Embassy during the Atlan-
tic Pact Treaty. At31, he left the
embassy to work at the Chevy
Chase Country Club where he
served 600 to 700 government of-
ficialsevery nightas the head chef.
“Can you believe it? My first

assistant was a 65 year-old Ger- °

man. And one night, I served Gen-
eral Gavin.” Henri and his son
laugh at the irony.

However, Henri was notsatis-
fied with the jobs in D.C. “I wanted
toknow New York, and further my
education.” So Henri worked in
New York fortwo years as the first
vice-president at The Vatel Club.
He then worked for the Campbell
Soup company in New Jersey for
six years. He was not getting paid
very much, but he was using the
opportunity to further his educa-
tion. Henri lifts his hand as if he

-were taking a pledge and smiles as

he says, “I promise, my English
used to be worse.”

When Henri was 44 yearsold,
he became the chief steward on a
French ship, the S.S. Independence,
for two years. He then became the
travelling food supervisor for the
InterContinental Hotel. He met
Lusa when he opened a restaurant
in a hotel in Montevideo, Urn-

guay. His son explains, “After he
left, one of his friends wrote to him
telling him that he wanted to ask
Lusa out, but she said she was
waiting for Henri Ducluzeau. So
my father started writing her, and
even proposed to her through the
mail.”

Henri then moved on to be the
food supervisor for the cruise line
Royal Caribbean. His son adds,
“Those were the years that Royal
Caribbean had the #1 food service
forcruise lines in the world.” These
were also the years that Lionel was
born in Miami. Years later, Henri
moved back to France and became
a wine consultant until he retired.

Bored with his retirement, he
decided to move back to the U.S.
and open upanewrestaurant. Why
did he choose Davidson? He likes
it. Henri says there is less pollu-
tion here, and “the water tastes
better.”

So Henri Ducluzeau opened a
restaurant in Davidson, NC where
he cooks all of the lunches and
dinners. Les Trois Faisans ties his
life together by binding his job and

committee is to locate the prob-
lems and then work with the Town
Manager, Mr. Brice, to set up
guidelines fornoise and alcohol. If
the complaints persist Rust feels
that the town could “pass really
strict ordinances and make living
off campus a pain in the ass.”

Matt Dormer, resident of
North Thompson Street, holds
Davidson College somewhat re-
sponsible. for the_recent.difficul-
ties. “The social scene at Davidson
is like a pressure cooker. Because
the school turned up the heat by
clamping down on alcohol use and
parties, more. steam, i.e. student
frustration, will inevitably spill into
the surrounding commuaity.”

Speaking about his residence
on behalf of his roommates, Dor-
mer offered assurances that any
and all unruly activity which could
disturb the other residents of North
Thompson will cease.

tradition and takes enormous pride
in his work. When he finishes
telling about all of the places he
has been and worked, Henri winks

the entire black population. Gen-
erally speaking, Hinson often feels
“isolated, angry, and a significant
burden” as one of the few black
students on campus.

John Eaves, the assistant Dean
of Students, believes that a major-
ity of the problem involves the
“lack of a critical mass” of black
students and faculty. These stu-
dents come from a large variety of
backgrounds and might not be-
come friends had they gone to pre-
dominantly black institutions. Yet
at Davidson, the black students
tend to seek each other out for a
sense of cultural identity.

Another large contributor to
the dissatisfaction follows from the
overall environment which does
not tend to be conducive to minor-
ity concerns. Eaves also sees the
small number of African Ameri-
cans on campus as a discouraging
factor for prospectives; this cre-
ates a cycle which hinders poten-
tial growth of minorities’ numbers
on campus.

Although the Admissions Of-
fice actively recruits black high
school students, there continues to
beadifficulty finding students who
are capable of benefitting from the
Davidson education, according to
Bob Douthit, Associate Dean of
Admissions.. Once the qualified
black students are identified,
Davidson must compete with other
highly selective schools for their
enrollment. When the prospective
student asks Dean Douthit about
life at Davidson for African Ameri-
cans, Douthit does not “‘sugarcoat”
the situation, rather he claims black
students are faced with a double
. challenge; they must face the ex-
ceptional workload, as well as the

lack of social outlets. Douthitreal-
izes thatmore black students would
attract more black prospectives but
that this creates a catch-22 situa-
tion where “the tiger is chasing its
own tail.”

“Time for actions, not
words.”

According to Hinson, the
black population at Davidson: has
dropped as many as 20 students
since he was a freshman and he
foresees the possibility of another
two African Americans leaving
after this semester. He has wit-
nessed occasional improvements
such as the creation of Alpha Phi
Alpha, a historically black frater-
nity. Hinson, though, still believes
that there are not enough black
students to fight the pervading ig-
noranceat Davidson; Hinson speci-
fies that by “black” he means “those
who can readily identify with the
black experience in America.” He
emphasized that “the BSC is not
closed. for black students only;

white students can attend events -

and be members if they feel they
can identify or want to identify.”

Anthony Foxx, SGA Presi-
dent, continues to promote amove-

than to continue to compartmen-
talize the problem. Foxx would
like to see African American is-
sues discussed in current courses
from history to psychology.. He
feels that the liberal arts education
would be most beneficial to all
students if it were applied to every-
day life. Demographic studies now
estimate that eventually African
Americans will be the majority of
the American population and Foxx
believes the Davidson education
should prepare students for inter-
action with all cultures. “Now is
the time for action, not for words,”
Foxx said he sees the changes made
as a result of past task forces ‘and
committee reports as “only deco-
rations, suchas the additional black
faculty, the ethnic studies concen-
tration, and BSC house.”

The development of relation-
ships between individuals from
different cultural backgrounds

might help people become more —

culturally sensitive, according to
Clark Ross, an economics profes-
sor who has been at Davidson for
twelve years. He plays a key role
in the Second Family program
which matches black Davidson stu-
dents with a professor to foster

Dean Eaves also encouraged
individual efforts beyond the su-
perficial. “How are your classes?”
He asked, “How many students
have genuine friendships with
black students?

“Davidson’s task at this point
requires conquering the compla-
cency of the majority,” said junior
Alden Smith, “but it is one thing to
recognize the problem and another
to be part of the solution.” Smith
regrets that Davidson still main-

tains a sense of exclusiveness that
does not allow African American
students to feel comfortable. The
solution involves all students mak-
ing a conscious effort to partici-
pate in events that might increase
their understanding of another cul-
ture. “It is a tragedy that black
Students often feel that they are
sacrificing four years at davidson,
so that they might succeed later,
when I value my college years as
four of the best of my life,” said
Smith.
