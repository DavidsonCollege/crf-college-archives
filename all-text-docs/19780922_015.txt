Davidson's Wildcats evened
their season record at 1-1 with a
Saturday afternoon victory over
Washington and Lee in Lexing-

ton, Va. The victory was a”

sweet one for Head Coach Ed.
Farrell, the staff, and the
Davidson players after having
dropped the season opener to
Fordham.

The Wildcats were leading
into the fourth quarter by seven
points, 14-7, before adding 20
more points in the final period,

The ’Cats went into the game
without the services of four
starters. Tackle Wyatt Alston
and fullback Page Walley will
return to the lineup for the
upcoming Wofford game. Quar-
terback Bob McCarthy and
linebacker Barry Cannon were
injured in the opening game,
however, and are out for the
remainder of the season.

The starting quarterback Al
’ Rhyne opened up the game with
a 46-yard touchdown strike to
, Craig Pyles, and freshman Mike
Bass converted the extra point.

In the second quarter, David-
son’s John Porter returned a
Washington and Lee punt for a
‘63-yard touchdown.

The fourth period was the

scored on a three yard run.
Most of the afternoon’s sta-
tistics were impressive for the

. ‘Cats. The team amassed a total

of 504 yards in the game. Rhyne
completed four of nine passgp
for 95 yards. Whitmire sparked
the final drive of the afternoon
wititwo completions out of two
passesfor44 yards.

Johnson, substituting for
Walley, was the leading rusher
in the game with 117 yards in 16

carries. Atkinson ran 16 times

for 95 yards. Pyles ran for 74
yards in 16 carries.

‘ Another aspect of the game
‘was ‘impressive but in a nega-
tive way. Davidson dropped the
ball eight times and lost five of
those fumbles. Rhyne threw one
interception. One of the punt
attempts was unsuccessful, and.
the Cats failed to convert on a
fourth and one situation at

the Generals’ 16 yard line. One’

of the five lost fumbles was at
the\Washington and Lee_seven
and another at the 22 yard line.
Farrelt commented, ‘We've
got to quit turning the bali over

to the opponents. We've done it"

10 times in two games.” He
added, however, that fumbles

were sometimes the result of .

extra effort and ‘‘you don’t
want anybody to stop giving
that."

for the Wildcats. Rhyne execu-
ted a 30- yard touchdown pass,

Cats drop well-played game

By ROB GILLISON
Staff Writer

Last weekend the Davidson
Wildcats’ soccer team played a
strong Duke Blue Devils squad
and fared better than the 3-0
score indicates. |

The game was primarily off-:
ense vs. defense; the Duke
offense again the Davidson
defense. Duke kept the ball on
the Wildcat half of the field with
a controleoriented style of
attack.
- The Davidson defense did,
however, rise to the occasion
and none of Duke’s scores Were
the result of detailed offensive
strategy.

The first of the Blue ils’
scores came on a oné-on-two
fast break when forward Rich-
ard Murray, who played with
the Jamaican national team,
beat a Davidson fullback and
left-footed a line drive that
bounced under the outstretched
arms of Wildcat goalie Mike
lordanou.

The second goal came min-
utes later on a Blue Devil
corner-kick that the Davidson
defense was unable to clear.
After seconds of desperate
scrambling in front of the goal,
the ball skidded into the corner
of the net.

The first half ‘ended with
Duke on top 2-0. Unfortunately
the two goal advantage was
increased to three early in the
second half on a beautiful cross
from Murray which was headed
into the goal.

' The remainder of the game

. Duke was content to use up the

clock by moving the ball around
the perimeter, just keeping the
ball away f from the Wildcats.

The Davidson offense was not
quiet even though they failed to
score. Throughout the contest
they had many opportunities
and kept the fans hopeful and
on their feet with a potentially

explosive fast-break offense.

The team plays away on
Wednesday and will not have
another home game until Octo-

Sing, O Muse, of the glorious

resurrection of our vaunted

cross-country team, which tri-
umphed so resoundingly last
Saturday on.the steep slopes of
Mt. Stone (that Mecca of all
God-fearing KA‘s) after five
miles of deadly combat-with the
awesome forces of Georgia
State University!

Tell, Divine One, of the-thani-
fold personal bests established
in that arduous conflict! Sanct-
ify our humble effort to des-
cribe, in 160 words or less, the
immortal prowess of 14 nylon
short-clad warriors nobly pur-
suing arete at a 5:25 pacel

An invocation, although at
first glance somewhat archaic,
is not in this instance
unwarranted, for although Troy
(unscheduled in °78) was not
sacked, GSU was thrashed very
thoroughly indeed (20-39); and
.80, duly invoked, we shall get
on with it.

Sophomore Bart Landess fin-

ished 26th in a field of 647 to

lead the Wildcats, who were
running a dual meet with GSU
within the greater context of
Atlanta’s annual Stone Moun-
tain Road Race. In so doing,

Landess sprinted the asphalt
course in a very quick 26:04 to

victory was the team’s first in dual competition this year.

Landess emerged as a veritable .

nip GSU’s number one runner.
by three seconds. Landess is
pushing the team in its work-
outs and should provide consis-
tent leadership in future meets.

And he has very tangible
support. George Strobel was
40th at 26:40, Doug Horn
coming off an injury surprised
everyone with a great run and
was 60th, John Davis was 5lst,
and Bob Sweet was 61st to
round out the top five.

Close behind were John.
Hoots (71st after a fall at the
starting line), Terry Morrow
(72), John Rees (82), Greg
Burnard (89), Vasili Carperos
(99), Jim Cheek (111), Danny
Armistead (112), Jeff Hamilton
(119), and Andy Umhau (132).

Everyone was under the 30-
minute mark, and the first
seven Davidson harriers were
honored with highly-coveted
**Stone Mountain Road Race
'78"" T-shirts, ‘fetchingly de-

ed in attractive black-on-
blue.

Meanwhile, the women’ 's
cross-country team competed
for the first time this year,
losing to Berry College as well
as GSU. ‘

The ladies did quite well, all
things considered, and senior |
Paula Kadison in particular
showed a considerable amount
of promise, running the course
in 34:44 to win a medal.

Susan Davidson, Sarah Todd
(she’s of cake-race fame}, Nancy
Wright, Lisa Shingler, and
Beth DuBose followed her ac-
ross. Also on the team are
Susan Robérts, Merideth Dur-
den, Elizabeth Dean, and Julie
Holding.

The Wildcats’ next meet is
Saturday, September 23, when
the team faces Berea College,
Warren Wilson, and King Col-
lege in Bristol, Tenn. The
women host Lynchburg College
at 11 am September 30.
