Elections °96

Vote for Bob Dole |

By DarissE BOWDEN

Before going to the Republi-
can National Convention in San
Diego, my interest in politics was
minimal, although I
knew the basics‘ of

voter involvement in history, with
1200 young adults in the Young
Voter and Page Programs.
We took an active role in the
Convention, and were able to dis-
cuss topics important to us with

adults to take an active part in the
Republican National Convention.
Another misconception about
Bob Dole is that his 15% tax cut
will lower our chances of recieving
student loans. On the contrary, his
ae balanced budget amend-

what this year’s can-
didates believed. I
knew that I disagreed
with most of Presi-
dent Clinton’s politi-

Bob Dole may be old enough to be
our grandfather, but he cares
about the youth of America.

ment (which Clinton ve-
toed) includes increas-
ing federal aid to stu-
dents by 50% overseven
years. Bob Dole’s pro-
gram, which limits gov-

cal ideas, and knew
that most everyone thought Bob
Dole was too old for the Presi-
dency.

Asa page at the Convention, I
learned that Bob Dole is honest,
strong (both physically and men-
tally), and that he cares about the
youth of America. The 1996 con-
vention included the largest young

congressmen, senators and other
government officials. We also led
floor rallies during the convention
to fire the delegates up for Dole/
Kemp, and ran errands for govern-
ment officials so the Convention
could run smoothly. Bob Dole
proved to me that he cared about
our generation by allowing young

ernment involvement,
will save $1.2 billion toward our
national debt, lowering the interest
rates we will pay. Bob Dole may
be old enough to be our grandfa-
ther, but he cares about the youth
of America. Dozens of testimo-
nies from both Republican and
Democrat leaders have proved that
