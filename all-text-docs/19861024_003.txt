‘Rusk speaker stresses Chinese lan guage as culture

By AARON LEVINE
Dr. Mao Miu Chu of the Uni-
versity of Nanjing in China spoke
in the Morrison Room Monday at
4:30. She is an expert on Chinese
culture and literature.

Beginning her often humorous
talk with the Dean Rusk Program
brochure, Chu mentioned how she
Particularly liked the stipulation
of “first-hand knowledge of a for-
eign culture through language
proficiency” mentioned in the
brochure. Cha maintained: “If

you want to know a foreign enl-
ture, you need to know the lan-
guage,”

With her talk entitled “The it-
portance of Chinese culure” Chu,
presently a Fulbright schotar at. the
University of North Carolina at
Asheville, mentioned the impor-
tance of knowing the Chinese lan-
guage in attempting to understand
Chinese culture. She mentioned
an old Chinese phrase, “follow the
mass:” Chinese is spoken by one
billion people, and with the in-

¢ereasing importance of China on
the work political and economic
scene il is becoming important to
understand Chinese. Not knowing
Chinese could bert, Cha men-

.tioned:; few Americans doing

business in China know Chinese.

‘Cha spent the greater part of
her talk in refuting common ob-
jections to the teaming of
Chinese. The first being that it is
difficult to lear, a recent Chinese
dictionary lists 47 O00 characters.
Yet a secent Chinese Language

Reform Committce found 7,000
characters in general use, 2,000
characters make up 90% of the ev-
eryday language, and knowing
700-800 characters is sufficient
for beginners. With 2,000 charac-
ters, ane can pretty much pel
around with the aid of a dictio-
nary.

Anothes complaint is that each
character entails too muny
strakes. Recently the characters
have been simplified for easier
leaming, in an effort to help wipe

out UWiteracy m China. Also,
many Chinese characters entail a
“radical” which indicates the gen-
eral category of the word, and thus
makes figuring, out the word
easier.

Chu also mentioned the “'pin-
yin" system of Chinese, which
uses a romanized alphabet and
also the four different tonal qual-
ities.

Finally, she maintained that
the best way to learn the language.

ot any language for that matter is

frough one stress at a time.

Coed dining alive but threatened

By DAVID WILLIAMS

While membership in co-ed
eating houses has declined over
the past four years and student in-
terest in fraternities and all-
women's eating houses has grown.
markedly, leaders of both Ema-
non and PAX say that co-ed eating
on Patterson Court is “thriving.”

“Tt’s aot the end of an era,”
PAX President junior Holly
Sparks said. “It seems that the
trend is toward single-sex dining,

but I[ think there will always be.

people who choose to eat in a co-
ed setting on Patterson Court, be-
cause it’s unlike anything the col-
lege offers."

Sparks said that while only
110 Davidson students participate
in co-ed eating houses, “the
people that are doing it enjoy it
immensely. They’re vey positive
about their experiences. This is
the choice that co-ed people have
made."

Both PAX and Emanon are
making strong efforts to encour-
age freshmen to join their houses.
Yet while PAX already has a rela-
tively strong membership of 65
men and women, Emanon faces a
formidable challenge to inerease
its current membership of 40 stu-
dents. But Emanon President
senior Chris Sullivan said that the
house is currently in excellent fi-

nancial condition. “As | see it
now, the house. can survive indefi-
nitely,” he said. Sullivan said
Emanon usually gains about 15
members between fall and winter
terms. “Emanon has always got-
ten a lot of transfers or people who
are dissatisfied with the houses
they eat in, who come to Emanon
in the middle of the year,” he said.

Still, Sullivan noted that re-
cruitment of freshmen this year “is
a definite area of improvement.”
He said; “In the past we haven't
handied self-selection as well as
we could have. This year, we have
been making a conscious effort to
let ourselves be known on Patter-
son Court and to the freshmen
especially.”

For the first time in three years
Emanon mesnbers Monday placed
a sign with the house's name on
the front of Emanon. Emanon
Vice President Mark Swift said,
“The idea of putting the name up
there is that we're trying our best
to let people know that we’re here,
and that we want people to come
by and get to know as, I think it’s
the attitude of the house in trying
to renew itself and show the rest of
the campus that we are trying our
best to be here and attract people
so we Can stay on the court.”

When the Vail Commons
opened in September, 1981,

Davidson students were given the
option to continue eating in the
Commons after their freshman
year rather than join a Patterson
Court fraternity. all-wamen's eat-
ing bouse, or co-ed eating house.
Within two years, co-ed eating
houses ETC and ATO folded be-
cause of a decline in membership.
Soon afterwards, in the spring of
1985, members of co-ed eating
house Fannie and Mable decided
to close their house for similar
reasons,

Al the time of ETC's closing,
ETC President Laura McDonald
"85 cited the arrival of the Com-
mons and of additional women’s
eating houses as the major factor
contributing to ETC's' demise.
But Sparks observed that co-ed
eating houses and other Patterson
Court houses offer “much more"
to the student than does the Com-
mons. “If you cat in the Com-
mons, obviously you'te ~ eating

with a mixture of male and female .

students like you are at a co-ed
house, but there are not the same
60 people at dinner all the time."
Sparks said, “The hours in the
Commons are more Mexible than
they can be at an eating house, but
the Commons doesn’t really offer
the sricial life that a coed house or
any Patterson Court house does.”.

1970's, after the College's Stu-
dent Life Committee. recom-
mended a major transformation in
Davidson's sacial system. Ac-
cording to a 1970 Davidsonian ar-
ticle the Committee recom-
mended the selective fratemity
system be transformed “into a sys-
tem of eating clubs, non-exclusive
in nature, which would gerve as
the basic social units for students
after the freshman year.”

This system soon came to be
known as “'seif-selection.” By the
spring of 1972. six fratermitics had
left the campus and two frater-
nities had moved to houses off
campus because their national
chapters would not allow them to
participate in self-selection.
Meanwhile, ATO, PAX, F & M,
Emanon, and Random House
were forined as non-selective eal-
ing houses. (Random House
folded during the following year.)
When the college began admitting
women, each. of these houses be-
came a co-cd cating house.

Assistant Director of College
Relations Bill Giduz.*74, who was
a founding member of Emanon,

. Suid that when the selective frater-
nity system was abolished, “it was
a time of ferious activism.” He
said: “Students were dead-set
against fratemities.”

Gidnz said that during the
same months when he and a group
of freshmen were working on
forming Emanon, “Students had a
big march on Washington. Some-
body threw a smoke-bomb in the.
ROTC department. There were
four studetits who conducted a
three-day fast for peace. So there
was just lots of protest about Idts
of things.”

Giduz, added: “The dissolution
ofthe previous social system was
all a part of that. Folks felt we
were breaking up the cliques and
doing away with the evils of the
fraternity system that had existed.
It was just a step toward the light,
away ftom the dark.”

Giduz. said, “The system just
didn't live. The students have re-
puted the system that was installed
during my time. It’s not a system
for the eighties. Apparently it was
just a system for the seventies.”

fraternities have increased their

selectivity since 1972, two co-ed_

still remain under the self-selec-
tion system as it was originally in-
tended, As Sullivan noted, Ema-
non members are “proud of our
house. We want to tell Davidson |
students to come on down and sce
what it’s like, and maybe you'll
find out that it’s for you. That’s
what self-selection is all about.’
