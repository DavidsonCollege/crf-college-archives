Students exhibit apathetic |
response in SGA elections |

By PHILIP DUNCAN
Staff Writer

Less than half the student
body voted in the recent
elections of SGA dorm sena-
tors and residence hall council
(RHC) members.

The September elections
have never drawn tremendous
voter interest, according to
some SGA officials, they felt
that the entire process this
year was quieter than ever
before.

One senatorial position went
uncontested, and there were,
only three RHC races. No one
filed for the RHC posts in the
other five dormitories.

Personal campaigning was
not extensive, and publicity
posters were scarce. Many
students admitted they did
not vote becalse they had not
seen or heard of the candi-
dates.

With only 30 minutes left
before the filing deadline, no
names had been submitted for
Cannon senator, so junior hall
counselor Marc Menchel filed
and was elected.

The Watts senatorial race
drew the largest turnout, as 70
percent of the freshman girls
voted. The race went into a
run-off, with Joanne Hull
winning a eMEN

Sophomore ‘Tenley -Shew-
make was elected senator for
Little. Carol Watkins canvas-
sed door-to-door for votes in
Sentelle, and her efforts won
her the racéthere. Guy De-
Cenzo was the sole candidate
from Richardson.

Steve Cuffe, Charlie
Strange, and Greg Kunkleman

were elected by the Belk
residents. Ed Sibley won a
run-off race to become senator
for Duke. In another run-off,
Chuck Weber and Victor
McMillan were selected off-
campus senators.

The results of the three
RHC Races were as follows:
Dean Copple was the winner in
Sentelle; Holt Foushee, Curt
Goho and Kim Kepchar were
chosen from Belk, and the
students in other college-
owned facilities picked Mark
Yow.

The SGA Senate will ap-
point members to the RHC
positions not filled in the
elections. These appointees
and the election winners will
serve through this academic
year.

Poll bearers: Students vote for dorm
senators and residence hall members.

Williams foresees financial pressure

By BILL BARNES

The next few years will
bring Davidson College a new
look, according to Vice Presi-
dent for Development, Craven

The Office of Development,
in conjunction with the Board
of Trustees, is currently
planning further physical and
financial development of the
college.

“Developmental _ offices,’’
said Williams, “are often
incorrectly considered synon-
ymous with fund-raising. I
prefer to define our purpose as
the development of under-
standing of the institution on
the part of various publics.”’

This he feels may be done
through publications and
meetings with alumni and
interested outside parties such
as foundations or corpora-
tions. Willaims’ goal is to
disseminate a knowledge of
the ways and means of David-
son which will aid in participa-
tion in it.

As a result of the Office’s
efforts, he hopes to gather an
amount of active support for
the college. “‘Once, you’ve de-
veloped an understanding,” he
commented, ‘‘you can acquire
support through means other
people can do.”

Admissions are one means
of support. Some 1500 appli-
cants were received for this
year’s freshman class, from
which 336 students were ac-
cepted. ‘‘But as costs increase
we're going to need a pool of
about 2000 applicants who'll
pay the price we'll be asking
and yet be academic enough to

maintain the standards of the
college.”’

Experiential programs pro-
vide openings for assistance
from various sources, notably
the 55 alumni chapters across
the country. “In order to plan
for experiential programs in
certain fields we need friends
who can offer things, especial-
ly in metropolitan areas.”

Support is also necessary in
order to implement the plans
the Goals Committee proposed
last spring--college improve-
ments to take place over the

next 12 years. ‘This year,”
said Williams, “the Goals
Committee enjoyed the luxury

of meeting and planning with-
out major financial worries.”
By 1987 the Committee feels
it should be able to expand
the endowment to the extent
which academic programs, fa-
culty development, financial
aid, and international educa-
tion should require.
Improvement of the physi-
cal plant will also begin, with

Senate report

Frustrated Union chairman

By STEPHEN BELL
Staff Writer

In a speech to the SGA
Senate, Marc Menchel an-
nounced hes resignation as
Chairman of the Social Council
of the College Union, and
asked that the Senate re-
organize the Union Board.

In accounting for his. frus-
trations in working with the
Union, Menchel was sharply

priority given to the chemis-
try facilities, Art department
and future student housing,
which will be planned with an
eye on conversion into .Jease-

able apartments should enroll-
ment drop drastically. Too,
new athletic facilities are being
considered, especially on the
IMAC level.

critical of Union Director C.
Shaw Smith and Union Presi-
dent Richard Wassen.

Menchel charged that under
their leadership, “the Union is

need for Union by-laws, and
said that he is in the process of
drafting some now. Smith was
net present at the-pipehing:

The SGA Senate dces have
some jurisdiction over the struc-
tures of the Union, but voted to
refer the issue of new Union
by-laws to one of its committees
to determine the extent of that
jurisdiction.

Both Menchel and Wassen
recommended to the Senate that
Robert Meyer be appointed to
replace Menchel on the Union
Board. The Senate accepted
Meyer’s nomination unani-

“All this is a long-term
project,” said Williams,
who cautions that the realiza-
tion of these plans is depend-
ent upon the economic stabili-
ty of the nation. The college
endowment gives the projects
a tinge of reality, he feels,
because it frees Davidson from
a dependence on student en-
rollment, which could fluctu-
ate drastically from year to

year.

Of the overall financial con-
dition of Davidson College,
Williams commented:- “‘Dav-
idson is not in a crisis. ‘A crisis
supposes a state of affairs
beyond control. The only
things that can happen after

‘one are undesirable, for in-

stance a fall in academic stan-
dards or being forced to join
the state system..

“Davidson has avoided cri-
sis because of the prophetic
planning of the Trustees and
administration, who operat-
ed cautiously during the boom
