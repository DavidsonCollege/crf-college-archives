By MIKE LINS

; Staff Writer

The Wildcat baseball team
may finally be in the winning
groove since they have won four
of five games this past week.
The team, now 11-18, had a big
win Wednesday afternoon over
Wake Forest 10-9.

Earlier in the week, the Cats
beat Wingate 12-8, split in a
doubleheader with the Citadel
by winning 1-0 and losing 3-1,
and beat local rival UNCC.

Davidson was trailing Wake
6-0 after five innings, but got on
track in the seventh. The Cats

chalked up ‘three runs in the
sixth and then struck for five in

the seventh. Joby Merton and.

Tim Goodell hit homeruns to
give Davidson an:8-7 lead.

Both teams added two runs
each, but Wake couldn't catch
up. Jonathan Young stayed on
the mound all afternoon for the
Cats.

In the Wingate game, senior
pitcher Ken Norwood pitched

nine strong innings to pick up -

his first win of the season. He
allowed only three earned runs
on four hits. Catcher Bob
Lapple was out with a leg
injury.

Frisbee golf is a growing
sport in America, and Davidson
frisbee enthusiasts had their
day last Saturday in the second
annual Davidson Golf Tour-
nament. :

David Huie, the instigator of
the tourney, almost won his
own tournament, but Chris
Friesinger was the victor on the
second playoff hole in a sudden-
death. Huie and Friesinger were
tied for the lead at 18 under par
after 36 holes of play. Bruce
Brown was a close third at 17
strokes below par. Professor
Bob Myers was the low scorer
-among the faculty members
that participated.

The original plans for this
year's tournament did not mat-
erialize, but Huie hopes to go

Davidson sophomore Greg
Burnard placed first out of a
field of 600 in the 10,000 meter
Charlotte road race this past
Saturday. Burnard ran the 6.2
miles in 32 minutes and 56
seconds, nearly a minute ahead
- of his closest rival. Margaret
Herman placed second in the
women’s division. Frizzle Wil-
lis, Bart Landess, and John
Hoots were the other Davidson
students running in the race.
Burnard said that he runs
approximately seven miles a,
day as a member of the track
team. A lot of the time goes into
- work worthwhile.
Burnard and the rest of the

Davidson track team would like
to do equally well in the South-
ern Conference championship
‘meet this.coming weekend at
Boone.

Burnard was proud of his
win, but a problem in the race
lessened his enthusiasm. Hoots
was trailing Burnard and
missed one of the turns in the
course that was not marked. As .
a result, much of the field ran
the wrong course. Burnard was
following the police car, but
Hoots was far enough back not
to know the right course. ‘I
would have liked to have won
