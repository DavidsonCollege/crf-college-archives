Why The Handbook Holdup?

By May Martin

Students, administrators, and
professors alike were left empty
handed this fall without the tradi-
tional Wildcat . Handbook. The
handbook is usually sent out to the
parents of incoming freshmen by
August, and is waiting for fresh-
men on their arrival to Davidson.
This year, however, the handbook
has yet to appear. According to
Dean of Students Will Terry, the
book will finally be on campus on
October 30.

The handbook, which contains
pictures of the freshman class and
a listing of their hometowns, also
includes pictures of hall counsel-
ors.and information newcomers to
Davidson find useful, from nearby
restaurants and churches to what
to expect from your roommate.

Last year’s handbook, edited
by Andrea Bond, refers to the book
as a freshman’s “bible and most

important reference tool for the

first few weeks of school.” It is
useful to freshmen as a way to get
to know the names and faces of
their classmates, and to the faculty
asa way to get to know their stu-
dents.

Assistant Dean of Students
Leslie Marsicano said that “every-
thing that could have gone wrong
with the publication of the hand-
book went wrong.” The bulk of the
work must be done over the sum-
mer, which is inconvenient for
students to do.

Terry noted that the handbook
ends up being more work than one
would expect.

Getting the pictures all together
is a task, especially when many
freshmen do not send their pic-
tures in.

After this year’s delayed and
difficult publication, Terry says that
next year’s handbook may be
handled in a different way. One
possibility is to contract with an

If You Happen To Be In Chambers Late At
Night... A Ghost Story

In honor of Halloween, I
searched the Archives. for a

| Davidson ghost story, butno luck.

The only mention I found of ghosts
were the ghost lines of Old Cham-
bers, a phenomenon that only
happens in hot dry weather.

Perhaps we are just lucky: no
grisly murders, no mysterious dis-
appearances, and only a few scary
looking faculty. Davidson just
doesn’t have any skeletons in her
closets.

But, she did have some in her
pillars.
It wasa dark and stormy night.
The students from the North Caro-
lina Medical Center, which was
located in Davidson [now out of
existence] and used the college’s
facilities, needed cadavers. Hear-
ing that a body had been recently
buried, a group of students crept
their way into a church cemetery.
Finding the grave, the students’
shovels picked away at the dead
body’snewhome. Steel ripped into
the ground again and again until
they struck wood. They scattered
the remaining dirt aside and lifted

Have you ever wondered what
thatshady smell mightbe that floats
over Davidson College every night
(excluding Saturday night) at 7:00
pm? Well, I have the answer.
Last month I was confronted

with a difficult project in Sociol-

ogy. My colleague, Taylor Smith,

applied for a job to assist a certain
slop collector for Patterson Court.

Since I was a freshman, I have
always been fascinated by the man
who drives that 1959 Ford truck
with barrels in the back. My good

and I entered a job search and™

up the coffin. Like one anxious to
open a birthday present but afraid
that he might not get what he wants,
the students hesitated at this thresh-
old of death then tore open the
coffin. There was the body.

Aware of the practice of grave-
theft, the deceased’s family dis-
covered the body missing a day or
two later. Since it contained the
dissecting room, Old Chambers
was the obvious place to start the
search.

Hearing that the law was
searching for the body, the stu-
dents had to act quickly. One of the
more unusual architectural char-
acteristics of Old Chambers was
that all four pillars were hollow. In
one of these holiow pillars, the
students dumped the body, added
some lime, and probably whistled
past the policeman. The body,
buried for the second time that day,
was never found. :

Well, never isa long time. The
rumor of this event haunted gen-
erations of Davidson students.
Groups of students would often
dare others to climb down the pil-

friend, Fran Vaughn, informed me
that this mysterious man was
Henry, “The Pigman”.

Actually Henry is apigman on
the side. Most students affiliate
him with the BP station on Main
Street where Henry is an auto-
mechanic.

I remember watching Henry
make his rounds on Patterson
Court. He would always hang out
in our kitchen during house meet-
ings. Every week I wondered what
the man dressed in green was doing
with the garbage cans.

In house meetings we discov-

outside company to produce a “face
book” which would be sold to
students and parents. He notes that
aproblem with this idea is that the
copy contained in past handbooks
which informs students of local
landmarks and lingo would not be
present in a book done by an out-
side company.

The second possibility is that
the college would set certain stan-
dards for the handbook, suchas the
deadline and the content standards,
and then let students take it over
from there, selling the book for
profit to students and parents.

Nevertheless, the Wildcat
Handbook willappear. Although
the campus has not had access to
the book during the time when itis

most wanted and needed, all will_,

lars to see the body, but those who
braved the pillar-tombs would be
smoke-bombed by their peers or
not have enough light to penetrate
the darkness.

At last, two friends, W. Dur-
mas and “Skinny” Campbell, de-
cided to end this mystery. While
the college was attending a foot-
ball game, these twoclimbed to the
top of Chambers. Like a ghoulish
Santa Claus, Durmas shimmied
down one of the pillars and un-
earthed a skull. Skinny climbed
down another pillar and discov-
ered the skeleton.

Some say that the legend of the
medical students was false; these
bones were just put in by a frater-
nity. Others claim that the pillars
were depositories for the Medical
School.

The trustees pointout that when
the pillars were torn down, nobones
were found. While others whisper
that if you’re in Chambers late at
night and you hear an odd howling
noise, it is the ghost of Archibald
looking for his bones.

My Adventures With The Pigman

ered that he collected “slop”, left-
overs from the dinners at the eating
houses and fraternities and fed it to
his pigs. However, there was one
question nagging in my mind. Did
this man really have pigs, or was it
a complete scam? The Sociology
project gave me an opportunity to
investigate the pigmanandhis truck
filled with slop.

Taylor and I met Henry at 6:05
on a Tuesday night to begin our
rounds. We dressed for the occa-

Gyn.Exam

- The regular gynecologic ex-
amination is an invaluable partof
preventive health care for women.
This annual visit to a: gynecolo-
gist helps ensure early detection
of life-threatening diseases, such
as breast, ovarian, and cervical
cancer, as well as STDs which
may lead to these conditions. The
routine exam also helps to deter-.
mine what “normal” functioning
of the body is for each individual
sothatabnormalities in this func-
tioning canbe more easily recog-
nized. 3

The first gynecologic exam
should take place at the, age of
eighteen or when a women first
becomes sexually active, which-
ever comes first. This first exam
usually includes education about
the body, discussion of specific
concems of the patient, and coun-
seling regarding health risk fac-
tors and lifestyle habits, as well
as the regular components of the
actual examination. oe

The examination itself gen-
erally consists of the following
