sonnel.

Tom Covington will leave his
position as Assisatnt Dean of
Students to become Assistant Di-
rector of the College Union. He
will retain his position as Fra-
ternity Liaison Ofiicer thereby
concentrating more of the stu-
dent activity around the basis of
the Union.

Faculty members who were
promoted from associate profes-
sor to full professor included
Frank W. Bliss, English: R.
Bruce Jackson, mathematics;
John D. Kelton, psychology: Jay
HH. Ostwald, education and psy-
chology: Ernest F. Patterson,
economies; and Max E. Polley,
Bible and religion.

Alan B. Brinkley and Philip
B. Secor were moved up to as-
sociate professor of philosophy
and political science respective-
ly.

Faculty members reappointed
on an indefinite basis were An-
thony S. Abbott, English; Alan
B. Brinkley, philosophy: R. Da-
vid Kaylor, Bible and reiigion:

selors to Richard C. Burts Jr.,

dean of students. The letter asks | “

for financial compensation equal
to full room ($220 for first-year
counselors, and an additional $40
per semester for second year
counselors, and outlines a pro-
gram to make the hall coun-
selors more effective and more
active.

According to Chris Hawk, a
hall counselor this year and
next, Robert Currie, college
treasurer, said that the proposed
salary for hall counselors is
submitted by Dean Burts.

Only four of the 14 junior
hall counselors of this year will
be returning to do the job next
year.

The hall counselors are re-
quired to be at a meeting in
September the day before the
freshmen arrive. This cuts off
a week from a job which may be
paying in that one week over
half of what a hall counselor
receives in an entire year, Hawk
commented.

As well as dealing in these fi-
nancial concerns. a program
consisting of meetings, written
reports, a Haison committee and
a change in the selection com-
mittee for hall counselors has
been suggested.

stated. “There :is an ever-in-

ing group who do produce.”

. According to Greene, Roose-
velt and now Johnson have led
the nation down the path to so-
cialism with their welfare pro-
grams. He reminded the audi-

pointed out that our national

combined. ‘Thirty-seven cents
of every dollar go to taxes, and
12 cents of every tax dollar are
paid as interest on the national
debt.

““RATIONAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL”

Dr. Harmon R. Holcomb, professor of Philosophical Theology,

has debated against the “death of God’ theology of Paul Van
Buren from a “rational and philosophical” basis. The new Death of
God Movement, said Holcomb, should be taken seriously. It is
a@ movement within the Christian church and not merely another
atheistic philosophy. Furthermore, he contended, the new theology
is completely seperate from the university intellectualism. its
internal question Is, “Can you have Christ without God?’ Hol-
comb appeared in chapel Monday. (Steff Photo by Olson).

“There are two main advant-
ages to Covington's proposals,”
McKnight continued. ‘‘These are
that the student no longer would
have to pay for fines, and it
would no longer be necessary
to show up for Friday traffic
court."

In the past, those who failed
to show on Friday had to pay
an additional three dollar fine.
“The new system is geared to be
more expedient for the student,"
McKnight concluded.

Final approval of the plan
was tabled for next Monday's
meeting at 5 p.m. so the Coun-
cil members could study the
new system further,

Alva Whitehead, Honor Court
chairman, received approval for
an increased budget to handle

his tradition of dissent as a so-

while doing a column for the
San Francisco Examiner, pub-

Playboy magazine says of
him: ‘‘Rexroth’s achievement is
that he has grown up. without
growing old, that in mellowing
