Those pugnacious Bulldogs from The

Cit: del more thoroughly contirmed their
reputation of being an extremely dithcult
team to defeat on its home Held by the
way in which. they fought themselves
into a 12-12 deadlock with the favored
Wildcat eleven in Charleston Saturday.

Evidently the ‘Cats suffered
from a tremendous let down after
their excellent showing against
the Dukes on the preceding week-
end, and that, coupled with the un-
expected strength of Coach Gres-
sette’s charges, was a little more
than they could overcome in one
afternoon.

The contest wasn't without its thrills,
however. Both Wildcat touchdowns
came after two lengthy jounts by Boody
,Wingtield Johnny Mackorell of 95
and Coach. Me-
Lver's two diminutive hacks “Joe” Wing-
field ando“Midget™ Verble furnished the
great thriller of the afternoon when
“Boody” took a Citadel kick-off in the
third quarter and raced 95 yards behind
Verble’s perfect interference for the sec-
end Wildcat score.

This same Wingfield gent had
thrown Johnny Mackorell a pass
in the first period, which the Wild-
cat Captain gathered in and sped
the remaining 35 yards to the
promised land.

Johnny, as usual, won the plaudits of
the mentors of the opposing aggregation.
Particularly did they compliment him
for his blocking, tackling and kicking:
He had somewhat of a punting duel with
E. Hall of The Citadel. Hall averaged
48 yards on his punts for the afternoon
and Mackorell had 45 on his. This was
the best pair of averages turned in by

and

35 yards, respectively.

any southern game played Saturday.

“Tubby” Hand, “Big- "Six’’
Johnston and Henry ‘“‘Flip’’ Cath-
ey get the laurels among the Wild-
cat linesmen: They all turned in
nice performances.

Johnny Siewers did a nice job
of going down under punts. He
was nailing the Bulldog safety
man in his tracks nearly every
time.

“Wimpy” Ravenel, one of the younger
members of Charleston's aristocracy, and
halfback candidate on the Wildcat squad,

took his mates to the city zoo in his
home town Saturday morning, where
they all had a big time getting the

monkeys stuck up in chewing gum and
throwing the ducks into the air and
letting them splash down on the pond.
Great entertainment for the boys. Some
of them, no-doubt, felt perfectly at home
among the wild creatures.

It will be Catawba this eae
and despite the fact that seven
members of Coach Kirkland’s reg-
ular Indian eleven are reported
on the injured list, it will be no
easy engagement for the Felines.
These gridsters from West Salis-
bury haven’t been scored on this
season, and they will be making
a gallant effort Saturday to main-
tain this unblemished record. I
forecast a victory for the 'Cats,
but it isn’t going to be a push-
over.

Paul Pittman, substitute triple threat
back sustained an ankle injury in the
Citadel affair, which will probably keep
him out of action for the remainder of
the season. This is a considerable loss
to the reserve strength of the Wildcats.

It is interesting to know that
every member of the varsity foot-
ball squad is well equipped with
brains as well as brawn. Not a
single candidate was ruled inelig-
ible for déficiency in his scholas-
tic pursuits, when the first month’s
grades were published last week.
Even though the first year men haven't

Phifer, won two-out of the first three

he played in the back court, seldom

tournament himself, being eliminated in
the third round by Tommy Phifer. The
fall tournament is held every year as
prelude to the regular tennis season for
the purpose of lining up material for
the varsity tennis team. It also serves
to give the players additional practice in
tournament competition.

and breaks.

The “All-Americans” kept Mars Hill
on the defensive practically all after-

noon, making two sustained drives for
nearly the length of the field, but when
they got within striking distance they
were not able to score because of sev-
eral penalties inflicted on them.

The Wildcats scored on a pass from
Peabody to Jim Johnston from the spread
formation which has been used by this
team so successfully in the past. Later
in the game, Tom Thurston intercepted
a Mars Hill pass on Davidson's thirty-
yard and raced to the goal line
seventy yards away for a touchdown, but
for reasons unknown to the Davidson
team, this play was called back, and
when Quick, Davidson's captain for the
game, objected to the play being called
back, the team was penalized 15 yards
for arguing with the referee.

Mars Hill scored their touchdown on
a sustained drive and kicked the goal for
the winning point on the second trial,
having been offsides on the first trial.

Jim Johnston and Jim Hodgin at ends

and Peabody, Quick, and ‘Thurston in
the backfield were the, outstanding
players for the “B” squad, while in

Wertz Mars Hill had a player of ex-
ceptional caliber, it being the boast of
the Mars Hill student body that this
halfback from Indiana has not failed to
make a gain on a punt return this sea-
son.

The “B” squad made,a total of nine
first downs compared to four for their
opponents. In ground gained the “All-
Americans” also had a marked advan-
tage, gaining 253 yards compared to the
77 made by the mountain -boys, however,
the Wildcats were set back 75 yards in

penalties while Mars’ Hill received only:

25 yards. The passing attack of the
reserves was functioning nearly as well
as that of the varsity, completing 8 out
of 14 tries.

This was the third game the “All-
Americans” have played. They beat
Wingate Junior College 13-0 in their
opener, and two weeks later they fought
to a 0-0 tie with Campbell College.

CATO TO PLAY
CATAWBA TEAM

Catawba Indians Replace William
And Mary On The David-
son Schedule

The Indians of Catawba College come
to town Saturday to meet the Wildcats
on Richardson field. Catawba replaces
William and Mary on the Davidson
schedule, the Virginians being forced to
cancel the game as they had previously
carded V. M. I. for November 3. The
Salisbury boys should give the ’Cats a
struggle despite the fact’ that injuries
were received by seven players in last
week’s scoreless tie with Presbyterian.

They have tallied 114 points and have
yet to suffer defeat or to see their own
goal line crossed. ‘The most crushing
blow to the Indians’ hopes came when
“Red” Meehan, third in the entire nation
in points scored, sustained a broken arm
in the P. C. game, which will keep him
on the sidelines for the remainder of the
season. Costly injuries were_ received
in Coach Kirkland’s line also, in the
persons of Captain Bob Pearson, ‘end;
Van Vaniewsky, all Little-Six conference
center; and Garland, 225-pound tackle.
It is possible that these casualties will
not prove as serious as they now appear,
and that these men, with the exception of
Meehan, will see service.

The Wildcats came, out of the Citadel
fracas in pretty good shape, except for
Paul Pittman, back. Pittman,
whose ability as a punter has proved a
great assef to the team, received an-ankle
injury, but he will probably see service.

The probable line-up is as follows: ‘

Feature For Cadets

‘Ably led by Captain Johnny Mackorell
and “Little Joe” Wingfield the David-
son Wildcats staved off the stubborn at-
tack of a fighting Citadel eleven Satur-
day and emerged with a 12-12 tie.

The game was packed with thrills and
kept the 2500 spectators standing on
their feet from beginning to end. The
Wildcats;—favared to. win before the
game, were slightly outplayed by their
Cadet opponents who offered unexpected
offense with their military shift and re-
verse spinners.

Davidson got off to a flying start
shortly after the game opened. Citadel
recoverd a fumble deep in her own ter-
ritory and punted out to Wingfield who
was downed on Citadel’s 45-yard. line.
On the first play Wingfield dropped back
and threw a 20-yard pass to Mackorell
who stepped the remaining distance for
a touchdown after eluding two would-be
tacklers. Mackorell’s try for extra

—| point was blocked by Andy Hall.

fighting spirit was now
aroused and—after the kick-off was
brought out to the 20-yard line, they
made two first downs and punted to
Davidson, the ball being downed on the
Wildcats’ 21-yard line. On the next
exchange of punts, Wingfield fumbled
and Yandell recovered for Citadel on
Davidson’s 26-yard lime. Then with a
beautifully executed off-tackle play Fer-
guson got away for a touchdown, tying
the score at 6 all. Faulkner attempted
to pass to Yandell for the extra point
but the ball was knocked down and in
a few minutes the half ended with the
score still even.

The second half opened with practical-
ly the same lineups that started with the
exception of Verble, who had replaced
Yarborough in the Davidson backfield.
Mackorell received Symmes kick-off
and returned it to the 18-yard line.
Wingfield picked up 16 yards and first
down on a short end run. On the first
down the Wildcats were penalized and
the ball now rested on the 21-yard line.
Two line plays failed and Mackorell
dropped back to punt, but as the ball
was snapped, Jenkins, alert Citadel
tackle, broke through and blocked Mac-
korell’s punt which bounded over the
Still dazed Jenkins dived for the
ball and missed it but Captain Billy
Symmes recovered, putting the Bull-
dogs in the lead 12-6, Hall's try for the
extra point was blocked by Big Six
Johnson.

However, Citadel was not to hold the
lead very long. Symmes kicked off to
Wingfield who gathered in the ball on
his own 5-yard line and did not put it
down until he had crossed the goal li e,
tying up the score again. This run’ was
without equal and gave the spectatdprs
a thrill long to be remembered.

Receiving the ball, Wingfield ran to
mid-field behind beautiful blocking where
he slowed his pace slightly, picked up
Midget Verble and cut over to the side-
lines where the Bulldogs were moving
in fast. Verble sprawled two Cadets on
the ground, leaving Boody on his own.
On the 5-yard line Tom Faulkner made
a desperate attempt to avoid the tie score
but Wingfield gave him that hip move-
ment for which he has become famous
in the past two games, and crossed the
goal standing up. Pittman was rushed
