Recent Campaigns Were Not Clean

Finally, after three weeks of
eight-track grins, computerized
balloting, paper posters, an au-
tumnfull of fliers umder your
door, and an Unopened End,
the elections are over, at least
until next year.

As far as my own campaign
was concerned, I have no com-
plaints whatsoever. Perhaps
more than anyone my opponent
is to be thanked for his admir-
able conduct during the entire
campaign. My feelings about
some of the other elections, how-
ever, are not so satisfactory.
During that first week I wit-
nesstd some of the’ most child-
ish and disgusting behavior by
students since the naughty days
of high school.

The week of the laurels, one
of our former con-editers de-
clared that everyone was to be
commended for such a clean
campaign. He may have been
moved to make this statement
because of the outcome, yet even
with this slight prejudice, his re-
mark struck me as an abject
lie. Fortunately the elections
got rid of him too.

To be specific, I turn my at-
tention to the election for SGA
president. Two candidates, dia-
metrically opposed, each back-
ed by his own ideological con-
stituency, sought the office. By
Tuesday morning the campus
was polarized by propaganda,
and armed with cliches and de-
lusions of moral supremacy, the
student body turned out in full
wool to vote.

Tuesday evening two letters
to the newspaper arrived in the
office of THE DAVIDSONIAN.
They were obvious endorse.
ments for Alexander, but there
was nothing profane or libellous
about their content, which meets
the only criteria of the newspa-
per for accepting a letter.

Since anybody with a little
journalistic discretion and three
years upstairs knows that he
should read anything under a
“Letters” heading with a meas-
ure of doubt, these two items
were included in that issue as

legitimate student opinion.

Subsequent to this decision,
however, one of the co-editors
attached a boldfaced little edi-
torial note in which he deplored
such letters. His motive for this
action was, if anything, more
Political than that of the let-
ters. Yet the editors decide pol-
icy.

The other co-editor, however,
felt left out of the campaign, so
he decided to endorse the other
candidate in the top editorial
on page 4 that week. This had
never been done before.

Of course, in the editorial he
dissociated himself mildly from
the staff, qualifying the unique-
ness of his opinion, which was
based no doubt on a Pauline
vision. This editorial, a prece-
dent, was in direct contradic-

tion to the tone of the editorial —

note attached to the letters on
the next page. On one hand, one
editor expressed his contempt
for cheap propaganda while the
other editor reserved the best
space on the editorial page far

ical cheesecloth opinion.

Fortunately, the present edi-
tor opposed the use of the pa-
per for such an unconsciable
purpose, and he has pledged not
to revoke such a dangerous
precedent in the future. It would
seem here that the judgment
of all the past editors of THE
DAVIDSONIAN and that of the
present editor is more compe-
tent than the precedent-setting
passion of a seminary student.

Leaving the newspaper, there
are some other umderhanded ac-
tivities which took place in the
dorms. Posters were every-
where, walls, water fountains,
and windows which is as it
should be.

But some did not take them
that. way. Instead they took
them down, en masse. Second
floor Watts serves as a good ex-
ample. On Sunday night, Alex-
ander supporters went through
that dorm slapping up posters
and platform sheets.

One of the supporters checked
by later that night on the hall.

something being ripped from
the wall, so he ran through the
door to see, not a freshman,
but lo amd behold, a hall coun-
selor walking away with a
poster in his hands.

An argument ensued _ with
both -of the hall counselors on
second Watts, and the follow-
ing morning one of their names
was reported to the office of
the dean of students. Will Terry
called in this person, a junior
alt Davidson College, and repri-
manded him for such childish
conduct, No other punishment
was issued.

So it goes. Take another ex-
ample. Alexander supporters de-
scended on Chambers also Sun-
day night putting up 20 thin
black posters ir. odd places
throughout the building. There
were four left the next morm-
ing. The custodian department
reported that they had been
forced to take down five of them
for maintenance reasons. Yet
the other 11 posters were torn
down, and the rest were gone
by that evening.

There were other lamentable
incidents. The retiring SGA pre-
sident, who thinks he is ‘“‘going
places,” also broke precedent
to endorse publicly his camndi-

date, another first at Davidson.

The Open End was another
brawl this year too, a farce to
the tune of audience participa-
tion. The only consolation was
that few people attended any-
how, and most of these had al-
ready made up their minds be-
forehand. Perhaps one way to
salvage the purpose of this gath-
ering would be to pick a mode-
rator from the faculty instead
of one from the Elections
Board. In this manner one im-
partial individual could serve
as a_ selective yet objective
mediator who might enforce the
rule of equal time among the
audience as well as the candi-
dates. If this fails, a sergeant-
at-arms might be more appro-
priate.

No, former con-editor, it was
not a clean election for SGA
president, not to mention the
Cooke County senatorial race
for rising juniors. It was not all
roses, but a sick rose, full of
invisible worms.

Maybe the Davidson gentle-
man is now a myth at this
campus, but the conduct of a
minority of students during the
past three weeks would have
been offensive to anyone under
30 as well as any child over ten.

PER Bt

Students To Test “800 Rule”

Two Clemson freshmen will challenge the constitution-
ality of the Atlantic Coast Conference’s Controversial ‘800
rule’ concerning the academic requirement that prospec-
tive athletes achieve a combined total of at least 800 on
the College Entrance Examination Board.

The students, Joey Beach of St. George and James Vick-
ery of Charleston, recently filed a suit requesting a pre-
liminary injunction to prohibit Clemson and the ACC from
enforcing the requirement. As of yet, no date has been set
for a formal hearing which is to take place in the US.
District Court in Anderson.

NCAA Concerned About Exclusion of Women
According to “The Chronicle of Higher Education,”
the National Collegiate Athletic Association recently dis-
covered that in trying to coordinate the nation’s sports, it
may have overlooked someone who does not wish to be
overlooked—the female. During the past year, Walter
Byers, the NCAA’s executive director, learned that wo.
men might have a legal case if they claim that the NCAA
discriminates against them in its all-male policies.

Faculty Council Discusses Department Head

Evaluation

In a recent meeting of the Faculty Affairs Committee
of Mississippi State University, it was recommended that
the department heads be evaluated every four years by full-
time faculty members with one year’s service. According
to the committee report, a decline in the “influx of fresh
ideas” by heads after several years of leadership has made
this evaluation nec .

The Faculty Evaluation Committee made a motion that
‘data collected on each faculty member participating in
the faculty evaluation be released to the Student Associ-

ation for publication purposes, if the Student Association
requests these data.’’ The motion was placed in committee
for further study.

U.N.C. Okays Limited Drinking for Union

Chancellor Carlyle Sitterson has approved the serving
and consumption of beer and wine at specific Student Union
functions at UNC. However, the alcoholic content must not
be greater than 14 percent, and the consumption of the
alcohol must be restricted to persons 18 or over..

C. O. Mathey, Dean of Students Affairs, explained that
selling of beer on other North Carolina campuses, such as
Duke or Davidson, is permitted by state law. State-owned
universities, such as U.N.C., may not apply for an ABC
license to sell beer or wine.
