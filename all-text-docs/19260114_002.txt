The campus of Davidson is not going to
jlack in sport this spring. The initial start
was made with the sport of snowball fights,
about which the Freshmen think that the
less said, the better. There may be several
more of these befére the beginners doff their
fresh caps.

In the 139 pound class, Davis, Hansel,
Alexander and Houk are showing real class
‘in their technique and strength. Both Cox
and Carrington are in the 139 pound class,
but it is expected that one-of them’ will be
shifted to the 158 pound class. Crinkley and
Christian are also working for a position in
this weight. The heavyweight material is
rather inexperienced but there is a large
supply of material, both in weight and in

'Coach Mattox’s Charges Will Make
State-Wide Tour in Late
February

Coach Monk Mattox has been working his
yearlings at a terrific rate since the holidays,
and they are fast rounding into a formidable
team. A number of Freshmen are out for
berths and most of the places are undecided
as yet. There is much more material out for
this team than was for the Fresh eleven, and
‘on the whole the team should have a more
successful season than did the football heroes.

However, exams will soon cut in on their
{practices and will impair seriously the prog-
ress that has been made. Manager Chris-
tenbury has been working hard on a sched-
ule, and has a very creditable one so far.
Several of the games are only tentative and
\have not been definitely decided as yet. It is
possible that even a few more games will be
added to complete the schedule, which will
be one of the best ever attempted by a Da-
vidson Freshman team.

One extensive trip through North Caro-
lina has been planned, playing Oak Ridge,
N. C, State Fresh, Wake Forest Fresh, Duke
Fresh, and a game pending with the Caro-}
lina Fresh. In return they play Duke Fresh, |
