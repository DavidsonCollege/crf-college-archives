On Biting The Hand That Protects You ©

We have long been unable to
understand the attitude most white
people in the Deep South hold toward
Martin Luther King. Some Southern
tabloid or politician is forevermore
cursing King as a “rabble-rouser and
troublemaker.” King has been accused
repeatedly of stirring up conflict
where none existed—his life has been
threatened countless times, his broth-
er’s house has been dynamited, a
friend of his was shot in the back, and
in general the Southern whites have
done everything possible to make his
life thoroughly miserable.

We think that Martin Luther King
is about the only thing standing be-
tween the Negroes of the South and
full-scale. violent retaliation against
their white tormentors.

Others holding such a view of
King include two of the primary lead-
ers of the present-day Negro revolt.
James Baldwin and. oddly enough.
Malcolm xX. Another man who
thoroughly believes in King’s deter-
rent power is a peace marcher_ who
was here this week named Ray Robin-
son.

Robinson, a big, powerfully built
Negro who was once a prize fighter.
has been engaged in non-violent dem-
onstrations for about the last six years.
For participating in civil rights pro-
tests he has been run out of towns.
beaten, shot at, had dogs and fire
hoses turned on him, and been thrown
in several jails. Robinson is no coward
and could obviously take care of him-
self, ‘and yet he has never hit back at
anyone. Asked to explain his attitude,
he stated that he believes in and lives
by Martin Luther King’s non-violent
method of protest.

Now Robinson has been in the
north enough to have been thorough-
ly exposed to the Black Muslim doc-
trine of black superiority, and to their
belief that militant force is the only
thing that will ever impress upon the
white man how much Negroes want
equal rights. As the big man put it.
“King teaches his people that if a
white man hits ‘em, to turn the other
cheek. Man. you walk up to one of
Malcolm X’s boys and look at him
hard, and you can just about count
on getting your throat cut.” But Ray
Robinson, because of his belief in Mar-
tin Luther King's principles, has re-

sisted the obvious temptation to join
the Black Muslims.

Someone asked Robinson if he
thought King’s influence over Negroes
in the South explained why racial
clashes in the North have consistently
been more violent than those in the
South, as Negroes attacked and
wounded policemen and whites in
several instances.

Robinson replied without hesita-
tion. “You better believe that. friend.
you better believe that. I'll tell you—
Martin Luther King is just about God
to Negroes in the South, but up North
he doesn’t mean a thing.”

Robinson paused. looked around.
and then pointed to the group around
him. “You might not believe this, be-
cause they’re 180 million of you and
just 20 million of us, but you better
believe we could buck. you, because
we got a cause—we're fighting for
our freedom. White fanatics may be
throwing dynamite at us right now,
but you. know-—we can buy dynamite
too. If anything ever happens to Mar-
tin Luther King, I guarantee you all
hell’s gonna break loose down here.
In fact it may break loose anyway if
white people keep messing around,
because pretty soon the Negroes may
get disillusioned in him.”

The big Neégro went on to tell
with no little emotion stories of inci-
dents he had seen or heard about in
which King or one of his followers had
averted an uprising and sure blood-
shed. He described one scene in par-
ticular that gave his listeners an idea
of what he was talking about.

Robinson told of snarling police-
men smashing and clubbing unarmed
demonstrators, of vicious police dogs
turned on women and children, and of
fire hoses shooting powerful jets of
water at human beings as if they were
trash to be washed from the street.
The infuriated victims of the brutal
outrage were subsequently told by
King’s men at a mass meeting to for-
give their ignorant oppressors and

under no circumstances to return the
violence. Thus another gigantic pow-
der keg was doused rather than ignit-
ed, and the white community could go
on smugly perpetuating its infamous
racial crimes.

But if Martin Luther King ever

During chapel last week the student body was sleepily confronted with the old,

known benefits of membership in the

It seems almost suspicious
that this organization should
still be submerged in the depths 1.
of obscurity. John Spratt seems
to think we ought to be mem-

to shed some provincialism.

It is perhaps even more un-

certain why no effort has ever 2

been made to introduce the

yet almost unheard of issue of the National Student Association (NSA), of which Dav-
idson has been a member for the last three years. A rather incomplete and informa-
tive account of the 1963 Congress was given.
Dave Hardeman said that he had a nice ti

me and had breakfast with a Marxist.

NSA Stands on Political fssues

The NSA has the reputation of being anti-fra-
ternity. This is, of course, a ramification of its
distinct stand on Civil Rights. The NSA does not
recognize the right of any organization, business,
etc., to discriminate for membership, service,
or so forth.

. The NSA recommends the abolition of the House
Committee on Un-American Activities.

But they were honest
themselves.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

J. G. Martin Upholds National Review

Dear Editor:

From all the tumult and re-
crimination over the current is-
sue of the National Review, one
might conclude that Davidson
would be better off had the sur-
vey of Student Beliefs chosen
Furman or P.C. or Wake Forest
as its Protestant-affiliated col-
lege. Then we could simply ig-
nore the whole thing.

It can still be dismissed if one
accepts the Patterson Hypothe-
sis* that it is all one dark
subversive plot to overthrow
the liberal faculties in a few
strategically chosen colleges,
ours included. What a dent thet
would make!

Assuming Dr. Patterson was
sincere, in spite of that busi-
ness about lying with statis-
ties (which is a revealing bit
of candidness for an econo-

mist), his charge of malicious
intent is not consistent with
the fact that all the data from
atl twelve colleges on alt 82
questions (105 actually) are
included.

For most of the colleges (Dav-
idson included) .many of the
data are complimentary from
the conservative viewpoint, just
as for most of them (Davidson
again included) there are many
data which should encourage
liberal confidence and optimism.
There are indeed many data
which reaffirm what many
would have assumed to be true
at Davidson anyway.

This was published for all. to
read and draw their own con-
clusions—hardly the practice of
subversive organizations. Isn't
it rather a practice that would
be worthy of any journal. Right

or Left. no less one which is
admittedly “A Journal of Fact
and Opinion”?

There was an unfortunatc
ambiguity in the survey’s ques-
tions about reaction against re-
ligion, which led to the superfi-
cial conclusion about the local
courses in religion having a
damaging effect on students’
faith.

This latter point would not
have seemed as important to the
Harvard CRIMSON in originally
preparing the questionnaire, as
Dr. Polley* and Mr. Ferris* have
correctly pointed out, other
questions indicate that the “re-
action” can be explained as a
maturation.

The 14 per cent (7 of the stud-
ents polled) who rejected their
earlier religious tradition is

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Simpson: Word-Eaters
Busy On Pupil ‘Apathy’

Dear Editor:

Those who've been proclaim:
ing Davidson students the most
apathetic creatures since Nero
fiddled while Rome burned have
had to do some word-eating
sinee last Thursday night.

It’s possible that some of us
think it's unsophisticated to get
enthusiast'e about anything, or
that we're daily exposed to so
much stimulation that it takes
a special occasion to produce
a visible change. At any rate,
when the Negro Revolution, the
Non-violence marchers, and the
Cuban anti-Castroites visited
campus, there were visible signs
that many were doing much in
the way of serious thinking.

But in this general clamor,
one voice was strangely still—
the voice of the faculty. This is

not to accuse the professors of
being apathetic; Davidson pro-
fessors are noted for their work-
loads, and there are only 24
hours in each day. However, it
seems unfortunate that more
were not present (and that those
who were remained largely
quiet) at the two discussions, to
lend their backgrounds to the
questions being raised: the his-
tory department in regard to
the fates of past non-violent
movements; economic, the
causes and effects in Cuba and
Birmingham; religion, the Chris-
tian aspect of the non-violent
and Negro movements; psychol-
ogy, the inherent mental pos-
sibilities of man’s accepting
complete integration and non-
violence as ways of life; mili-
tary, the possible consequences

of unilateral disarmament;
philosophy, almost everything.

Some professors may fee!
that the students are not in-
terested in what they have to
say outside of class; that they
would put e “quietus” on dis-
cussion If they spoke out. But
these were perfect opportuni-
ties for us to “get our money's
worth” out of our faculty by
hearing their questions end
comments. And we needed
their larger store of informa-
tlon.

It is unfortunate that those
two oppostunities have been
missed; but all is not lost. Many
have suggested inviting faculty
members from the various de-
partments and the two campe,

policies or attitudes of NSA
to the student body, or to re-
cord any impact that NSA has
made on Davidson.

]t seems to me that each year
the students have less and less
to say about the policies of the
College. It appears reasonable
that the students should have
some voice in the codification of
policy, at least in the area of
student government.

A logical place to start is with
the NSA, an organization that
few students know anything
about, which is here without the
consent of request of the stud-
ents, and which nevertheless
purports to represent their opin-
ions.

(See adjoining box for a
collection of NSA stands on
political issues.)

First of all, only 3868 of the
more than 2,000 institutions of
higher learning in the United
States are members of the NSA;
few delegates from these mem-
ber schools (usually about 500
attend the annual ten-day meet-
ing on a Midwestern campus)
are chosen in college-wide elec-
tions, the rest are selected by
the student government. David-
son sent only one delegate to
the 1963 Congress, he was not
elected, probably less than a
handful knew he was even go-
ing, fewer than that knew any-
thing about NSA at all, and even
fewer, maybe none, had any
recommendations to send along
for consideration.

This is true, and really nobody
disputes it: NSA is a confedera-
tion of student governments, not
of individual students. The peo-
ple who go to the Congresses,
where NSA policy is formed, are
not representative of their stud-
ent bodies.

The NSA, then, is brought un-
der question from two points:
its relevance at Davidson and its
prerogative to assert “represen-
tative student opinion.”

It seems obvious, first, that
the NSA has failed to signifi-
cantly contribute anything to
Davidson. Second, an examina-
tion of the attitudes and of the
policies of the NSA will go a

long way in pointing out the ex-
tent of agreement between the
Davidson student and the NSA.

One can say, with little fear
of successful contradiction, that
the NSA is a controversial or-
ganization, dabbling with radical
social and political philosophies,
and hardly representative of

3. The NSA opposes any loyalty oath (political or
otherwise) for students receiving federal loans

for education.

4. The NSA denounces any measures of the United
States to achieve nuclear superiority.

5. The NSA criticizes United States foreign aid to
Spain, Portugal, Republic of South Africa,
Nicaragua, Haiti, Peru, Paraguay, Guatemala
and Argentina, but does not mention aid to
Yugloslavia and Poland.

6. The NSA regrets the absence of contact with the
All China Student Federation, the Chinese Com-
munist Student Union.

7. The NSA defends the Japanese student riots
against former President Eisenhower.

8. The NSA opposes the Cunningham Amendment
which prohibits the distribution of Communist
Propaganda through the United States mail.

9. The NSA opposes the sections of the McCarren
Act (Internal Security Act) which: (a) prohibit
from entry into this country those persons who
at.any time have lent their support to a totalitar-
ian government, who have held membership in .
such an organization, and who have subscribed

lege.

Further, it has failed to pro-
duee any results which are tan-
gible and significant enough to
warrant the endorsement of
Davidson. Neither do 1 believe

provincialism.

able for one to stand up for
what he believes is right?

istory shows many other
great men who have stood up
for what they believed to be
right, despite powerful opposi-

up, we would never have had
the Protestant Reformation or
the American Revolution.

George Wallace and the other
segregationists know that “sep-
arate but equal” schools are in
the best interests of both races

quirement of providing equal

Fourteenth Amendment really
were legally ratified. :

Most anthropologists whose
minds have not been clouded
with equalitarian assumptions
agree that there are basic dif-
ferences among the races which
are deeper than physical fea-
tures.

The environmental condi-
tions which are said to have
caused physical differences to
evolve among the races could
just as easily have caused
mental differences to evolve.

Because these mental dif-
ferences are known to exist,
the education of elther e white
person or Negro is enhanced
when he studies at a school
with others of his race.

To improve the condition of
Negroes is a just cause, but the
manner in which integrationists
pursue their cause endangers
the level of educational insti-
tutions, the rights of states, and

Congress which purports to be
the voice of their opinions;

If other “reform groups” fol-

for the federal government; the
principle of limited government

Then we might all be equal—

Cuts von Unwerth

Dear Editor:

The article (Oct. 4) by Rick
von Unwerth attacking the ac-
tions of Governor Wallace seem-
ed to me to be very radical and
“explosive” coming from an in-
stitution such as Davidson.

However, I realize that such
individuals as the writer is (sic)
in a very minority group and
usually express themselves way
out of proportion to their num-
ber. This has been the exper-
ience in the northern colleges
because this type of individual
usually likes to be expressive
similar to the “soapbox” orators
in Hyde Park.

i am still happy that | sew
fit to send my boy, at en in-
creased expense, so far away
from home in order to get
away from similar associates
in the northern colleges.

Perhaps, if one knew more
concerning the writer’s history
and background, this vicious
type of expression might be ex-
plained.

T hope that your staff will see
fit to publish more articles typi-
cal of Davidson College.
