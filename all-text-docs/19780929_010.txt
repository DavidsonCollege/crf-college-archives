Harriers from Carson-New-
man and King College displayed
unexpected talents and stunned
Davidson’s cross-country team
last weekend. The oppositions’

strength and a lack-luster Dav-

1dson performance spelled doom
for the Wildcats.

There were scattered rays of
optimism in the oppressive
gloom, however. George Strobel
(7th) and Bart Landess (8th)
ran solidly while navigating
King’s 5.1 mile course in just
under 29 minutes. Freshman
John Hoots charged to a 30
yard lead at the start, although
he fell back after one and a half
miles to finish 12th. Freshman
Danny Armistead also ran well

and finished 22nd.
Other Wildcat finishers were

John. Davis (13th), Doug Horn
(14th), Terry Morrow (16th),
John Rees (21st), Bob Sweet
(25th), Greg Burnard (26th) and
Jeffries Hamilton (27th).

This weekend’s Homecoming
cross-country meet (an annual
affair this year followed by a
football game) pits Davidson
against Lynchburg College. The
Wildcats are bent on redeeming
themselves against the bitter
rivals from Lynchburg.

Senior Assistant Manager
Charles H. McDaniel scouted
the opposition last weekend,
and reports that the Lynchburg
ranks are somewhat sparse (6
men). Apparently all nine fresh-
men who joined the team at the
beginning of the season subse-
quently quit.

Also on Saturday, the David-
son women’s team, in its inau-
gural home meet, faces the
Lynchburg women. Paula Kad-
ison, Susan Davidson, and their
teammates have been toiling for
several weeks now and pro-
nounce themselves ready for the
contest.

Davidson’s women hope their
performance against Lynchburg
will impress skeptical coach,
Norm Koller. After a recent
time trial, the ladies excitedly
reported the best time of the
group to their .coach, believing
it worthy of his unqualified
approval. Koller frowned, stu-
died the ground for a moment,
and responded as tactfully as
possible, ‘‘Well, we'll have to
improve that.”

Starting time for the women
is 10 am. The starting gun for

the men’s race follows at 11 am..

away.

Fired-up Cats dump Wofford

_ by BERT MOBLEY
Staff Writer

The Davidson College players
and coaches realize that the
1978 Wildcat edition still has a
way to go before reaching the
team’s full potential. The first
three quarters of last week’s
31-27 win over Wofford, how-
ever, proved that the Wildcats
have the ability to beat a good
football team. The ’Cats will
have the same chance again this
week as the Cats enter David-
son College’s Homecoming
game with Bucknell.

The Bucknell Bisons have an
0-2 record -so far this season,
but those losses came to Divi-
sion I- opponents VMI and
Rutgers. The Bisons will be
coming to town seeking their
first victory of the season.

Homecoming is naturally a
festive occasion with visitors
coming to the campus and
parties going on all over town.
The ‘Cats want to add to that
festive atmosphere with a win
at Richardson Field Saturday
afternoon. Approximately 5,000
people are expected to view the

-Head Davidson Coach Ed
Farrell sees Saturday afternoon

as a significant point of the
season. He commented, ‘‘For
us, this game has the same kind
of significance as the Wofford
game. If we’re going to be
successful we’ve got to compete
with teams like Bucknell.”

The Wofford Terriers presen-
ted a formidable opponent for
the Wildcats, but Davidson
built up a 31-7 third quarter
lead before allowing Wofford to
score three second half touch-
downs.

The Wildcats had been
plagued in the first two games

with fumbles, but the ’Cats only
lost the ball once last weekend.

This fact, along with the 31—27
victory over the Terriers was a

significant morale builder for

the team.

Farrell said, ‘‘The win over
Wofford could be a major boost
for us in terms of confidence.
That is the biggest ingredient
that we need to become a good
football team.’’

The ‘‘upset’’ began early in
the game for Davidson. Quar-
terback Al Rhyne capped a
66-yard opening drive with a
touchdown boost from the one.
The kick failed, but Davidson

went on to score 15 points in the

second period. _Rhyne comple-

ted a nine-yard pass to Gifford
Piercy to give Davidson a 12-0
lead and Alvin Atkinson ga-
thered in a Rhyne pass for the

two —point conversion.
Wofford came back to within

a touchdown, 14-7, with only a
few minutes remaining in the
first half. The Rhyne to Piercy
combination struck for six
points again on a 56-yard pass
play. Freshman Mike Bass
kicked the ball through the
uprights for the extra point
with five seconds remaining.

In the third quarter, Bass
accomplished a rare feat in
college football. He made his
first collegiate field goal at-
tempt good for three points by
booting it from the 38 yard line.
The extra ten yards of the end
zone made Bass’ kick a 4%
yarder. Davidson's scoring was
completed with a-12-yard run
by Page Walley.

Then, however, Wofford
made a valiant effort for a
comeback win. The attempt
stopped four points shy. Wof-
ford Coach Buddy Sasser was
not pleased with the officials’
judgement concerning two fum-
bles late in the game when the
Terriers were closing the gap on
the ’Cats.

He is quoted “as saying, ‘‘We
recovered two fumbles and they
gave them to Davidson. It
sounds like you're making excu-
ses when you talk about. ‘he
officiating, but they would not
give us the ball.” ‘He did add to
his comment however, ‘We got
too far behind. Tt was a great

_ win for them and they out-

played us.”’

Farrell regarded the last few
minutes of the game as one of
the most important aspects of
the afternoon's’ plays He suid,
“Wofford had some:momentum.
and it was a necessity for us to
hold on to the. football. [t's a.
strong indication that we have
become a winner:"’ «
