Ostrowski details method and use of DNA profiling

By William Robert

Dr. Ron Ostrowski, Visiting
Associate Professor of Biology,
lectured on “Forensic Use of DNA
Profiling” to a crowd of students
and faculty Friday afternoon in
Dana science building.

DNA profiling, formerly
called DNA fingerprinting, is a
relatively new branch of genetics
which is growing increasingly
more important to forensic scien-
tists and lawyers involved in court
cases. aie oN

' from the blood of the accused to

DNA found at the crime scene, it
aims to either exclude or include
the defendant from those who could
have possibly committed the crime.

Ostrowski said exclusion
means that the DNA gathered as
evidence from the crimescene does
not match the accused’s DNA.
Exclusion is 100 percent accurate.
Inclusion occurs when the two ge-
netic samples match; however, this
does not prove that the accused is
the only possible perpetrator.

The science of DNA profiling
combines population genetics with
molecular genetics using anumber
of new experimental methods. In
DNA profiling, geneticists cut the
sample of DNA into pieces and
analyze the pieces using probes,
pieces whose genetic structures are
known, to find the pieces on the
DNA sample which match up with
the probes. .These processes use
methods known as variable num-
ber tandem repeats and polymerase
chain reaction, the latter of which

is a new technique.

Once the individual’s DNA
pattern is determined, scientists
look at population genetics data-
bases to see how many people of a
certain population in acertain area
have DNA profiles which match
the sample. These databases must
be fairly specific in order to get
accurate results.

Ostrowski related DNA pro-
filing to the O.J. Simpson trial. He
explained.how methods of DNA
profiling have been used to include

O.J. because his blood type alleles
matches the blood found at the
crime scene.

In addition to teaching at
Davidson, Ostrowski is Professor
of Biology at UNC-Charlotte,
where he has taught for over 20
years. He has also testified as an
expert witness in genetics and DNA
profiling inapproximately 25 court .
cases, including the trial of those
responsible for the World Trade
Center bombing in New York two
years ago.

SGA Supports dropping Presbyterian requirement for college president
Some feel this will undermine college’s ties to Presbyterian church

Church continued from page 4 '

today if it had not wisely shedded
discrimnatory policies.”

Intervarsity Planning Team
Leader Giorgio Hiatt states, “It
should not matter whether or not
the president is Presbyterian. The
most important characteristics of a
president should be a vibrant faith
and an ability to marry faith to the
rigorous academic ideals of the
college.”

Dean of Students Thomas
Shandley comments, “Davidson is
a remarkably successful and im-
portant institution not only to this
region but also to this country. We
should ask ourselves how much of
that importance is due to its guid-
ing principles, such as the affilia-
tion with the church, our Presbyte-
rian alumni, and people who are
not even necessarily Presbyterian
but belive in Christian values.
There is certainly a timeless qual-
ity about all that— we mustat least
pause before changing.”

Facts and Figures:
The Presbyterian Church and
Davidson

Members of the SGA re-

searched the issue. Freshman Sena-

tor Colin Kelly discovered that 429 _

students are Presbyterian, roughly
one fourth of the student body and
the largest religious denomination
on campus. Onkey found that ap-
proximately $20,000 per year is

received directly from the church. ©

Also, Onkey noted that eight out of
the top ten donors to Davidson are
Presbyterian.

Independent senator
Johnathan Orr indicated that one

out of eight Presbyterian-affiliated —

colleges requires the president to
bé Presbyterian.

There are approximately 1.5
million Presbyterians in America.

African-American population is

President Issue Sent to Trustees
While certain Senators wanted
a vote, Rosenbach suggested that a
letter be written articulating the
opinions of senators both for and
against the qualification. Most of
the SGA agreed that sending the
letter was an effective solution.
Junior Senator Nick Troiano
complains that the letter is indeci-
sive. “The SGA does things to send
a message, but not the right way.
The idea of the letter is a good one,
but the SGA acted too quickly. To
get a strong message takes time —
you can’t just sit and write down

the good and bad things about an
issue.’

Onkey feels strongly that the
SGA should have voted on the
issue. “By just representing op-
posing opinion, the SGA has not
done its job. We need to attach a
vote to the letter, something tan-
gible so the trustees will know and
listen.”

Ecumenical Council Chair
Lillian Montgomery feels that the
letter was an appropriate response,

“adequately representing both sides
and the variety of responses to the
issue,” but the Ecumenical Coun-
cil independently initiated a
peitition to estimate the number of
students opposed to changing the
presidential affiliation require-
. ment.

Montgomery reports that ap-
proximately 200 students signed
the petition, affirming their belief
that the Presbyterian heritage is a
unique aspect of Davidson. The
Ecumenical Council will use the
results of the petition in their own
communication with the trustees,
planning to present the petition
along with a letter stating their
position to President Kuykendall
and then to the trustees.

According ~ to’ “Larry
Dagenhart, Secretary to the Board
of Trustees, the trustees convene
in February for a meeting prima-
rily concerned with the budget and
college finances, but are expected
to address the issues at their spring
retreat.

Director of Institutional Re-

search and Assistant to the Presi-
dent Dr. John Kelton concurs:
“There is no doubt that the Trust-

ees will not delay unnecessarily in

‘addressing this issues. But as the

issue broadens, there is the chance
that the board may decide that in-
stead of looking at each issue sepa-
rately, it would be better to look at
the whole package; then they may
take a good bit of time to study
what it means to be church-related
and what Davidson’s practices and
policies actually should be.”
Underlying Concerns
Former Dean of Students Will
Terry comments, “All together
what these things say is that what
Davidson wants to do is be differ-
ent than it has been in the past and
be like every other first class col-
lege in the country. I worry about
two things, besides the integrity
and ‘the'continuity of the college:

first, attracting students. If we

beome like everyone else, I’m not
sure we can compete. The Ivy
League is sexier than we are. Our
ace in the hole is ‘our distinctive-
ness. Secondly, we cannot, through
our policies, tell the constituency
that has always supported us that
we do not care about them any-
more.”

Junior Matt Griffith agrees:

“What I like about Davidson is that
we are the only top 10 school that
has not yet sold its soul. I see
Davidson as a place that is nurtur-
ing to a Christian faith yet not
demeaning to other backgrounds,
and I think that is the way it should
remain.”
Role of the SGA
in Religion Debates

Rosenbach maintains that in-
troducing these issues is an impor-
tant responsibility of the SGA.
“When I gave my inagural speech,
the one thing that I asked SGA to
do was have a vison of a broader
picture of Davidson and
Davidson’s_ future,” says
Rosenbach. “So the things that I
have tried to do are meant to ‘imple.
ment that’ vision.” *

College Chaplain Rob soe
agrees, “I think it is wonderful that
the SGA has chosen to address
these issues, even if people don’t
agree over what the outcome should
be. Of course we wouldn’t want
evéryone to think the same way.
This SGA is fulfilling its role by
making suggestions and showing
foresight by raising important ‘is-
sues.”
