What about the
Presbyterian game? Are
we in shape to take it
home for the various
visitors, dates, and loyal
alumni? Elsewhere on
this page, you will find
a“ Bloodshed Boxscore”
of the casualties suf-
fered by the team in the
past few weeks, some of
them serious enough to
warrant loss of the
player for several games,
but others just for this
all-important tilt with
the Blue Hose.

The Cats have shown

By DICK LILES

that they have. the stuff against both VPI and the first half
against The Citadel. In both games the lack of reserves resulted
in the weakening of the team in the second half of each game.
Especially against Citadel with the weather more !ke the beach
type. did the team show a definite need of strong reserves.

However in the two mentioned games, the team
was without the services of several important links in
the starting eleven. Roy White was missing for the
VPI game and saw only limited action against The
Citadel. Arnold Whisnant was injured in practice and
missed the Bulldog scrap, and Johnny Guiton with two
bad knees saw only limited action in Saturday's tilt.
Bobby Turk. the Defenstue Demon and Pass-Snaqging
Friend for the Cats, has missed both tilts with iis
sprained ankle and perhaps left the biggest hole on
the team.

CITADEL TOOK THE BIGGEST TOLL

However it was the Charlestonian crew that took the
biggest toll. The most crippling loss was that of last week's
Wildcat of the Week. A. C. (Ace) Gregg for the rest of the
season. Gregg suffered a fractured thigh while making a tackle
late in the second quarter. A. C. was eighth in the Conference
rushing this year before his untimely injury.

The Bulldogs also inflicted an awful blow. when Dave
Williams came out with an injured knee (which is the most
frequent and numerous injury). Dave was most valuable for
his pass-nabbing ability and will be lost for at least this week.
He is very responsible for Jack Ruth's fifth position in passing
in the Southern Conference.

Also on the sick list for bum knees are Bill McNeely and
Dave Peeler. George Nickels sprained his ankle and there were
several cuts which required stitches on various members of the
team.

HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL

Several of the injured will be ready for the game, especially

the boys with the cuts. in addition to several others who have
been out for some time. Johnny Gray, out with separated ribs,
is a possibility at halfback, where the position is weak with re-
serve strength. Johnny Guiton and Roy White should be in the
best shape they've been in for the past. two weeks. Bobby Turk
is almost back to full speed and should fill in the big gap there.

And so the team with all its aches and pains does
have a chance and should put up a good fight. They
want to win this one for many and various reasons.
Ace certainly would be happy to see the boys rack up
a healthy score against the Blue Hose, not to speak
of the Wildcat Clubbers, families and dates. It shapes
up to be quite a fine time to even up‘our standings in
the win-loss column. The team has the stuff and bar-
cing unforseen further setbacks, PC could mean another
victory for the Cats. They haven't the finest team in
years, but are always a scrappy crew and would espe-
cially like to knock off their “big’’ cousins. A real scrap
is on tap for tomorrow with both teams needing a
victory badly. °

EARLY PRACTICES FOR TENNIS & BASKETBALL

“Coach Barton is holding informal practices for his rac-
queteers during the early fall days in preparation for perhaps
his best season since losing Bo Roddey and Whit Cobb two
years ago.

Coach Baird has called for candidates for his cage team on
the 15th of this month and expects the largest response in many
years. Only three men were lost by graduation and to the army,
these being Captains Tommy Haller, Dutch Hengeveld, and sub-
center Bill Proctor.

CRIPPL-

Gridsters Face Homecoming Tilt
Gregg, Nickels, Williams Out

By TAD CURRIE

As the crowd flows into Richardson Stadium Saturday aft-
ernoon, there will be but one question on the minds of the faith-
ful followers of the Wildcats who have once more descended
upon the oak-shaded campus of the old Alma Mater for what

is, “Can they win?”

To this many a senior will
answer, “They have to, after all,
they haven't won a Homecoming
game since I've been here.” It was,
or so it seems, back in the dark
ages when the Wildcats last won
on Homecoming, but the crowd that
will make the annual pilgrimage
on Saturday may be the lucky
viewers of a Homecoming victory.

There can be no minimiza-
tion of the fact that to pro-
duce a victory over always
tough Presbyterian College
with an injury ridden team will
be a tough job, but it can be
done. Coach Little is shifting
his personnel like a chess
player, trying to find replace-
ment for injured ends Dave
Williams and Bob Turk, cen-
ters George Nickles and Arnold
Whisnant; linebacker Dave
Peeler; tackle Bill McNeely;
backs Roy White, Johnny
Guiton and A. C. Gregg, whose
stellar playing in last Satur-
day's game against Citadel was
terminated by a broken leg in
the second quarter after which
the team fell apart.

It will be a Freshman-domi-
nated Davidson squad that goes
against Lonnie McMillian’s Blue
Hose Saturday. Although P, C,
hasn't racked up a terrime record
this year—losses being to Clemson
and Furman and a tie with Western
Carolina—the Blue Hose are al-
ways a tough caper for the Wild-
cats, for a P. C. victory would
make the season a success for the
South Carolina institution.

Top on Crowell Little’s list
to spark the attack Saturday is
freshman Jimmy Thacker who
has been called by many the
outstanding newcomer to
Southern Conference football.
If Jimmy continues to play the
way he has in: the past two
games he will be a hard man
to stop and could spark the
injury-riddled Wildcats to a
victory. Others who will see
plenty of action are Bobby
Amos and LeRoy Fargason.
With a team made up of un-

known qualities, it’s anyone’s guess
what the outcome will be, but a
win would be welcomed and some-

whose absence will be felt in more
ways than one. With a desire to
win and a non-defeatist attitude
the Wildcats could bring the ba-
con home on Saturday and really
make Homecoming a happy occa-
sion.

Greeks End Week
Of New Tag Game

The first week of Davidson Col-
lege’s experience with tag football,
whose only resemblance to actual
football is the ball, ended yester-
day with twelve victors for the
first two rounds, leaving practical-
ly all participants in the game in
complete bewilderment.

This combination football with
basketball rules, begun here this
year to ¢heck the number of in-
juries sustained by players of the
old touch game known in earlier
years, has been popular at Carolina
for some time.

Despite the confusion of this
first week of play, a number of
teams took to the win column.

Wildcat Of The Week

By WALLACE ABBOTT

In the third game of his college
Career, Jim Thacker was voted
Wildcat. of the Week for his Stel-
lar performance against Citadel.
The unusual thing about that state-
ment is the fact that Jim is just
a freshman this year.

Despite the fact that Davidson
went down to defeat last week, Jim
was So outstanding as to draw fa-
vorable comments from both sides
of the playing field. Even Coach
Crowell Little wmade the statement
that “Jimmy Thacker played his
best game for us today,” and this
is certainly a noteworthy com-
ment.

Jim came to Davidson this year
after having played bail for Darl-
ington for the last few years. It
was there that he also made quite
a name for himself in prep school
circles.

When you go out to the game
Saturday and spot Jim Thacker “on THACKER

Tennis Aspirants
Have Early Drills

By MOODY SMITH

Tt may be a long time until spring
and their first match, but David-
son’s varsity tennis team is already
staging daily practice on the local
courts. °

Three official practices are being
held cach week with voluntary sés-
sions on the two remaining week-
days. This practice schedule will
be followed throughout the fall
months.

At present prospects for the
1952 season look very good. Only
three lettermen from last year’s
team, which compiled a record of
10 wins against only six defeats,
have been lost through graduation.
Returning from last season's var-
sity are Captain Allen Strand and
Dewev Keesler, who played num-
bers one and two respectively, plus
Joe Dudley, Tom Staley, Bill
Hivins atid several others,

Up from the freshman team are
Sophomores - Johnny Bremer and
Corky Johnson. The key to the
Wildcat tennis prospects, however,
may lie in the hands of several
freshman candidates who could

‘Twell land top berths on the squad.

Most potent of these are Leighton
Green, former Texas state high
school champion; Lacy Keesler,
winner of many high school and
junior net laurels in this state;
Corky Clark and George Snead.

Long-Winded Cats
Tackle UNC. Today

By BO TYNES

Coach Pete Whittle’s charges, al-
though. displaying a decided im-
provement, will have to take the
underdog’s role as they meet the
highly-touted Tar Heel cross-
country teani this afternoon.

The general inference around the
track seems to be that the Red
and Black will lave to go a long
way to down the Chapel Hill ag-
gregate. The Carolina team is rated
on even terms with the N. C. State
Harriers who toppled the Wildcats
17-46 last Friday. The greatly im-
proved Tar Heel group sports a
freshman running in first position
while their last year's captain has
moved back to fifth position.

The Wihkdicats, Jed by Tom and
Dick Stockton, although facing a
tough: schedule, display strong
possibilities for the ensuing season.
The present Cat lineup by position
is a» follows: Stockton, T (co-
capt.), Stockton D (co-capt.), Ship-
ley,. Henry,.I.ce. Feeney, Charles,
Alexander and Caudell,

The Davidson harriers will next
face Richmond, Washington and
Lee and V.M.J. on the following
consecutive weekends, winding up
their schedule with the State and
Southern Conference meets.

Fresh out of Bivalve, N. J., he arrived on the campus all
bug-eyed and his big mouth hanging open. He was :*
immediately sucked into a “shell game” and found
himself making all the quick-trick cigarette tests.
But his native instinet told him that such an
important item as cigarette mildness couldn’t
be tossed off lightly. Millions of smokers
everywhere have discovered, too, that there’s but
one true test of mildness.

It’s the sensible test...the 30-Day Camel
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try Camels !
as your steady smoke...on a pack-after-pack
basis. No snap judgments! Once you’ve tried
Camels for 30 days in your “T-Zone” (T for
Throat, T for Taste), you’ll see why...
