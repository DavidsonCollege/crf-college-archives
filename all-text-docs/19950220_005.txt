University will
pay jobless grads

ROCHESTER, NY—It’s an
annual rite of spring: college
seniors lie awake at night an fret
they’ Il graduate witha huge debt,
100 resumes out, no job in sight,
and Mom and Dad as their new
landlords.

If only college came with
some sort of guarantee, say many
wistful college students.

Now at least one does. Be-
‘ginning next year, entering stu-
dents at St. John Fisher College
can qualify for a program that
will pay students $417 per month,
up to $5000, if they aren’t of-
fered a job that requires a college
degree within six months of their
graduation.

But the new program,
dubbed the Fisher Commitment,
is hardly a license to lie on the
sofa and take it easy. Before
students qualify for the payout,

Computerized GRE:

will controversy Get Really Extreme?

By Jay JENNINGS
Staff writer

An academic controversy is
brewing about the GRE test. The
Educational Testing Service is at-
tempting to phase out the paper-
and-pencil GRE in favor of the
newer computerized GRE. This
change has caused many problems
for students attempting to take the
GRE for graduate school next fall.

The issue of computerized test-
ing came up as early as November
1993, when The Princeton Review
discovered some flaws in the com-
puterized version that could allow
for cheating. The Princeton Re-
view went to court to try to make
the security flaws public to “level
the playing field for all students,”
according to John Katzman, Presi-
dent of The Princeton Review. Its
legal action was blocked and noth-
ing occurred until December, 1994.

On December 16, the Kaplan
Educational Centers exposed the
flaws in the test by getting test-
takers to memorize the test and
reproduce it. ETS then filed a
lawsuit against Kaplan for expos-
ing the flaws.

Publicist for The Princeton
Review Jeanne Krier said that the
ETS has a monopoly on this type
of testing. The Princeton Review
claims it is trying to protects the
rights of students which are being
infringed upon. Director of Re-
search Development Andy Lutz

says, “While ETS is turning the
clock ahead regarding technology,
they are turning the clock back on
the rights of students.” He be-
lieves that the computerized GREs
represent “technology not ready
for prime time.”

Krier said that the computer-
ized tests could discriminate
against people who do not have
access to a computer to practice.
The computerized test-taking pro-
cess is significantly different from
the usual method, and taking the
computerized test without com-
puter experience could be disas-
trous.

This exposure has forced ETS
to change its testing process. ETS
immediately canceled one week of
the computerized testing and re-
duced the number of these tests
from one a week-to one a month.
The computerized GRE is offered
at 75% fewer locations than the
paper-and-pencil GRE, which
means that many students have
been prevented from taking the
computerized tests.

The ETS has been scaling
down the number of paper-and-
pencil GRE’s in a three year pro-
cess to change to the computerized
version. In two years all tests will
be computerized. Director of Ca-
reer Services Carol Jordan believes
this change is a “positive. one.”

them to schools faster. Jordan also
mentioned that students can cancel
tests easier if they are unready.

Students seem to have a very
different opinion supporting The
Princeton Review’s position. One
strike against the computerize ver-
sion is that it costs $96, as opposed
to $56. Senior Steve Krause took
the computerized GRE and said
another problem was the structur-
ing of the test. Krause “felt that it
was more difficult because you
could not skip questions,” which is
different from the practice tests
that he took.

Also, because he could not
skip questions, he answered only
28 questions on the verbal section,
which he did not feel accurately
represented his skills. The com-
puterized GRE is an adaptive test,
meaning it changes according to
the test-taker’s answers. Most stu-
dents are not prepared to take these
types of tests after taking paper-
and-pencil tests for every other
standardized test.

Senior Matt Melton believed
that the computerized test was dif-
ficult because one cannot make
any marks on the reading passages
which appear on the computer
screen. He feels that this is a very
important study aid that students
are now unable to use.

Students can take the paper-
and-pencil,GRE..in-April, but,the
scores will not be. sent to graduate
schools in time for the fall of 1995.
