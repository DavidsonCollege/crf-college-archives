Davidsonians Attend

Fraternity

Wyche Fowler. a Phi Delt and
member of the IFC, and John
Kuykendall left for Boston yes-
terday morning to participate in
the annual National Interfra-
ternity Conference.

The conference will be direct-
ed toward the theoretical or
ideal fraternity situation rather
than a mere relating of frater-
nity affairs in U. S. colleges. Its.
purpose will be to teach rather
than to inform.

The national meeting will ap-
praise the general situation of
college fraternities and discuss
how fraternities can improve
relations with their own schools
and with the public in general.
Also, part of the conference
will concern the expansion of
national fraternities and meth-
ods for the promotion of this
expansion:

Earlier in the year the Na-
tional IFC wrote Davidson and
asked if the college would ac-
cept new fraternity chapters on
campus in the near future. Kuy-
kendall said that if a group of
students desired to establish a
new chapter and showed the
need for one, the college would
accept and provide for a fra-
ternity with good national stand.

uated from there with a B.A.
degree in speech. The newly-
initiated member of Phi Beta
Kappa continued his studies
with graduate work in music-
ology for which he received a
M.A. degree.

After three years in the U. S.
Navy during which time he
wrote music, Gordon accepted
his present post of chairman of
the Wilmington (Ohio) College
musie department. In addition
to his work as a college admin-
istrator, teacher, composer, and

FILTER CIOARETIES

Pranksters Strike Again:

Freshman Banner Waves

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonian Festure Writer

The outhouse that had graced the front of Chambers was scarcely a memory
when campus pranksters struck again. But this time they left an ID card, of sorts.

Nobody knows just what the
architects had in mind when
they put that pole on top of the
cupola of Belk dormitory, but
three freshmen decided to put
an end to the speculation. Ac-
cordingly, a cold, barely-begun
Monday two weeks ago found
these stalwarts, no doubt inspir-
ed by Vespers, converting a use-
less ornament into a very utili-
tarian flagpole.

FLAG DEFIANT RED

The flag was bright red with
two-foot black corduroy letters
that defiantly said '65, on both
sides yet. And it was on Belk
Dormitory, center of upper-
class agitation. And no one
could figure how it got there.
Or how to get it down.

Even when the story leaked
out how the flag was wired
securely to the pole, there were
a few people who still believed
that it just couldn’t be done.
Astonishing as it seems, the
jolly midnight crew from the
fourth floor of Cannon had
climbed out a bathroom window
on the top floor of Belk, then
scaled a roof with a slope that
would make a mountain goat

think twice.

Once on the ridge, the daring
pair clambered down the other
side where they dropped a rope
to their accomplice and used it
to haul up a ladder and the flag.
With the ladder, they gained
the narrow balcony of the
cupola, and then the most intre-
pid of the lot went up the ladder
again as it was perched pre-
eariously on the ledge, and tied
the flag to the pole.

CHARLOTTE NEWS LAUDS

Sound easy? No one was will-
ing to try the method, or any
other, again, and the flag flut-
tered merrily Monday and Tues-
day. The Charlotte News snap-
ped it and declared that the
“always lively Davidson cam-
pus” had seen the “stunt of the
year.” Freshman spirits soared.

But by Tuesday afternoon, the
banner was doomed. Upperclass-
men could no longer stand the
haughty looks and News editor-
ials. A decisive counter-attack
was launched.

SOPHOMORES IRKED

Less than forty-eight hours
after its folds first caught the
brisk wind, the pride and glory

of '65, the flag that was sup.
posed’ to fly “a long, long time,”
was down. Using the techniques
they had perfected while placing
a red parachute on the dome of
Chambers last year, three sopho-
mores assaulted the cupola
alpine fashion, captured the
booty, and descended to divide
the spoils, literally.

So as holidays came to Dav-
idson, all that remained of the
freshman class’ _ short-lived
triumph was the tin can and
stick they had used to affix
their colors. But if Belk was
once again an untainted symbol
of the upperclass, the fledgling
wildeats could at least take
heart that their side had been
neater.

Blood Drive

The annual blood drive
sponsored by the IFC will
take place Dec. 10-11, from

13 a.m. to 5 p.m.

A free drill cut and a free

If you think you're seeing more Marlboro men
lately, you're right. More than 25,000
smokers all over the country are switching
to Marlboro every month!
You'll know why when you try them.
Marlboro is the filter cigarette with the unfiltered
taste. The secret of the flavor is the famous
Marlboro recipe from Richmond, Virginia... and
the pure white Selectrate filter that goes with it.

Try Marlboro and judge for yourself. On or
off campus, you get a lot to like.
