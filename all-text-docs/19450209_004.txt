required to remain seated after
chapel until all upper-classmen have
left the auditorium.

In addition to these requirements

which all freshmen must observe
are:

1. Keep off the grass.

2. Carry laundry when requested
to do so by upper-classmen.

3: Speak to everyone on the cam-
pus. *

4. Show proper respect to upper-
classmen,

It is hoped that all students, both

new and old, will co-operate in
seeing that regulations are observed
and in reporting. promply any and
all violations. Only by co-operation
can the work of the Court be carried
out in proper manner, and the tradi-

tions of Davidson be perpetuated.

!'DANCES THIS WEEK-END
(Continued from Page 1)

The gymnasium is to be attractive-
ly decorated with red and white pa-
per Streamer, and lounges and. chat
rooms are to be provided fér both
the boys and their dates.

Arrangements have already been
made for the placing of dates in
Duke dormitory, which is under the
direction of Mrs. Caldwell, super-
visor of dormitories. Last Tuesday
afternoon and Wednesday morning,
registration was held inthe Alumni
office for all boys who are having
dates for the dances. The informa-
tion asked The
name of the date and her address;
the length of
she was

was as follows:

Davidson, and the name and room
number of the who

student was

registering,

The following regulations govern-
ing the dance were provided by the
social committee of the faculty: Fol-
lowing the Friday night dance, the
girls must be in the dormitory by
2:30, and following the Saturday

jnight dance, they must be in by

12:30. These regulations were. pro-
vided after much
and are

consideration,
with the idea
that the faculty does not trust the
student body, but with the idea of
helping the student body to conduct
a dance that is properly chaperoned
socially, In any other college in the

not given

country, rules similar to these are
invariably laid down, and there is
no reason why Davidson, which
ranks so high in other ways should
give dances year after year in which
the arrangements for a date’s room
is handled in such slipshod manner.

So if everyone is willing to try
these rules once and will attend the
dances with the idea that they were
given to help them instead of hin-
der them, I am sure that we will
be able to say that: “A good time
was had by all.”

say that teaching a class will not
