DR. COLLINS TALKS ON
PROSPECTS FOR MEDICINE

Doctor Collins, a successful young
doctor of Charlotte, spoke at the “Y”
service Sunday night, on the laymen’s
viewpoint of Christian work, He came
to Davidson as one of the series of
lecturers under the auspices of the Civi-
tan Club, of Charlotte.

Before going into his talk he gave
some startling facts and figures on sub-
jects of vital importance to young men.

Doctor Collins spoke of the choice of
a vocation, presenting it from the stand-
point of a doctor. He told of the num-
erous false medical cults that have
grown up in late years and pointed out
the dangers the public is exposed ‘to
through them. The need for good doc-
tors, he showed, was all the greater on
account of these false cults.

He then told of the exacting require-
ments that one has to meet in order to
become a doctor, telling of the years of
careful preparation and then the follow-
ing years of practical experience before
one is qualified to gamble with human
life.

Although there are many sacrifices
that have to be made and many great
services that the world never knows of
must be done in the profession of medi-
cine, Dr. Collins showed that the doctor
does not go unrewarded. The doctor is
not rewarded in a purely pecuniary way
but his is the reward that comes from a
great service well done.

Doctor Collins presented his appeal
from_the doctors standpoint in a clear
and forceful way and the close attention
given him by the entire audience bore
proof that they thoroughly enjoyed his
talk.

COLLEGIATE PRESS MEET
AT WAKE FOREST COLLEGE

The North Carolina Collegiate Press
Association ‘assembled in fourth semi-
annual convention as the guests of Wake
borest College last Friday and Saturday.

‘the convention ‘was opened Friday
night, ‘J. F. Hoge, of Wake Forest de-
livering the address of welcome. O. A
Coffin, Editor of the Raleigh Times, de-
livered the address of the evening, after

“which there was tendered a reception by
the staff of the Wake Forest Student.

The second meeting of the conference
was held Saturday morning, addresses
being delivered by President W. L.
Poteat, of Wake Forest and E, E. Folk,
former editor of the Old Gold and Black,
and C. S>Green, Editor of the Wake
Forest Student. The remainder of the
morning was devoted to reports, election
of officers, and other items of business.

The delegates were guests of the
Atheltic Council, Saturday afternoon, at
the Wake Forest-N. C. State baseball
game.

The crowning climax of the conven-
tion came Saturday night when the staff
of Old Gold and Black became host at a
brilliant banquet in the dining halls of
the-Wake Forest Hotel.

The convention this year may be re-
garded as the most decided step ever
taken for the advancement of the col-
lege publications of North Carolina. Col-
lege journalism was given an impetus
that will long remain and that will place
the collegiate journals of North Carolina
in the front ranks of National publica-
tions of this nature.

Officers elected to handle the execu-
tive affairs of the Association for the
coming yeat were: Alice Lowe, Mere-
dith College, president; Lois Rogers,
Queens College, first vice-president; R.
S. Pickens, Carolina, second vice-pres-
ident; Bertha Moore, Meredith College,
secretary; L. D, Elkins, Davidson, treas-
urer,

The convention next year will be held
at Meredith College in Raleigh. The
Meredith delegates left the impression
that nothing will be spared to make the
next convention a repitition of the Wake
Forest affair.

The Davidson delegates were R. F.
Davidson. and L. D, Elkins.

MINISTERIAL BAND ELECTS
OFFICERS FOR COMING YEAR

At the regular meeting of the Min-
isterial Band, *Sunday afternoon two
important business matters were dis-
posed of. After the devotional exercises,
which were led by T. H. Patterson, the
president, Gus Summers read the new
constitution, which has just been drawn
up by a committee.

The purpose of the Ministerial Band
as stated in the constitution is “To pro-
mote brotherhood and fellowship among
ministerial candidates and to help them
make their lives count more for Christ.”

There is also a clause in the constitu-
tion providing for the acceptance of “as-
sociate members,” comprising students
who are studying for missions other than
evangelistic and men who intend to do
“Y" work.

An election of officers followed this
very important presentation of the pro-
posed constitution. Those elected to
kold office in the Band for the coming
term are as follows: W. T. Baker, pres-
ident; J. Lee McLean, vice-president; A.
M. Martin, secretary; and H. K. Russell,
treasurer. :

date,

The officers for the coming year were
elected at this meeting and are as fol-
lows: president, W. M. Heston; vice-
president, W. F. Galloway; secretary, N.
R. Currie; treasurer, K. T. McCrary.
These new officers, who are very capable
of leading the club through another suc-
cessful year, will begin their duties next
September at the beginning of the fall
term of college.
