The Davidsonian

Cats Close Erratic Season With ECU

By DAVID MELTON
Staff Writer

The Davidson baseball team
closes out an “up and down”
season this weekend.

Wildcat Baseball Coach Tom
Stevens characterized this sea-
son as probably his ‘‘most frus-
trating year” as baseball coach
at Davidson.

He added that the team has
much more potential than it
thas shown this year.

Stevens said that this Wildcat
team is ‘‘the best assembly of

athletes” that he has had at Da-
vidson.

He feels the major weak
points of the team are defense
and hitting. In 28 games this
year, the Cats have committed
65 errors, and Stevens quickly
pointed out that ‘‘this is too
many errors to make and still
have a winning season.”

The other problem the team
has faced is the inability to
score runs.

The Wildcats are about the
second or third team in batting

averages but are about last in
the category of the number of
runs scored in the conference.

Tuesday, the team traveled to
Belmont Abbey where they lost
3-1. The Cats left 10 runners on
base.

Stevens pointed out that Da-
vidson had mamy more oppor-
tunities to score than Belmont
Abbey, but were unable to cash
In.

Meanwhile the Abbey made
the best of its opportunities, in-
cluding a two-run double.

Thinclads Split Dual Meet,
Close Season At SC Meet

By TOM SOOS
Staff Writer

Davidson track coach Heath
Whittle coached his last home
meet last weekend, but it is dif-
ficult to say whether his team
won or lost.

The thinchads competed in two
dual meets simultaneously Fri-
day, defeating the Keydets from
VMI, but falling to The Citadel.

The Citadel managed to over-

power the Cats by a score of
78-67. The main reason for the
Bulldogs’ victory was their su-
perior depth.

In the 17-event meet the Da-
vidson tracksters managed to
take seven fi!sts, vine seconds
and five thirds.

The Davidson runners, how-
ever, did do much better against
VMI. The score of that meet
was 81-57.

As usual the team was paced

Cat Netters Sweep
Tourney Openers

By PETE CELENTANO
Staff Writer

After a relatively poor show-
ing in a turbulent and incon-
clusive season, the Davidson
tennis team is starting to come
on strong.

Yesterday, the netters mov-
ed into a tie for first place
in Williamsburg, Va. Tied with
the Cats are William and Mary
and Furman.

The Davidson team won all
of their nine matches yester-
day, five singles, including a
bye and four doubles.

The team defeated challen-
gers from VMI, Richmond and
The Citadel.

“The team to beat in this
tournament is William and
Mary,” noted Harry Fogleman,
net coach for the Cats. ‘‘They
have the strongest and most
heavily subsidized team.”

Fogleman said chances were
good that the Furman team
could be knocked out of com-
petition in today’s matches.

“Furman plays William and
Mary cm the number one court,”
Fogleman said, ‘‘and if they
lose there, and if we win three,
they will be out.”

If the Furman team loses to-
day, the tournament will be set
up for a direct Davidson-William
and Mary clash.

Davidson meets William and
Mary in five matches tomorrow,

starting with Bill Allen’s sin-

gles at 9:30 a.m. and including
both doubles and singles action.

Fogleman would not make
awny predictions for the tourney,
but said, ‘‘the other teams are
scared of us.”

“I’ve just told the other coa-
ches that we'll show up on the
courts tomorow and be ready
to play,” he added.

The tournament will continue
today and tomorrow.

by Ray Swetenburg. This week
Swetenburg broke his own high
hurdle record with a time of
14.2.

Other records were broken by
Wceody VanMeter and David
Crumple:. VanMeter broke his
own record in the pole vault
and Crumpler set a new school
record in the discus.

He was more concerned with
the Southern Conference Meet
which is this weekend in Green-
ville, S. C.

Whittle felt that the Davidson
team should do relatively well.
“We should be at a peak and
we have a good chance to place
fifth,” he said.

The schools that he picks to
finish ahead of Davidson are
William and Mary, East Caro-
lina, Richmond and Furman.

Last Saturday, the Cats split
a doubleheader at The Citadel
10 and 12 in what Stevens
termed as “two well-pitched
games.”

Although the pitching has im-
proved, the team still ranks last
in the conference in earned-run
average.

Stevens also added that the
team has seemed to hit better
against the better pitchers.

Stevens has been well-pleased
with the performances of sev-
eral of the players.

Freshman George Weicker re-
eeived praise for his hitting,
which is third in the confer-
ence.

Stevens also pointed out that

Harold Wilkerson’s all-around
play and Mark Rodgman's RBI
production should be commend-
ed.

Pitchers Dwight Plemmons,
Mike Frye and Joe Duncan also
drew praise. Duncan, however,
has been sidelined for the rest
of the season by recurring ankle
injuries.

The Wildcats close out this
season with three home games
this week-end. Today, at 1:30

m. the Cats have a double-
header with Furman, and to
morrow a single game with East
Carolina at 2 p.m.

Stevens hopes that ‘‘we can
gain back self-respect in these
last three games.
