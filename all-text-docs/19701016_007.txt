Parachute Show
Will Open Game

A parachute team from
Fort Bragg, promising to be
as accurate as Davidson
quarterback Mark Thomp-
son's passes, will perform
prior to the Davidson-Fur-
man football game at Rich-
ardson Stadium Saturday
afternoon.

The parachute jumps —
four are scheduled — will
begin about 10 minutes prior
to the beginning of the foot-
ball game. The jumps. will
be made by four members
of the Sports
Club of Fort Bragg.

There will be four jumps.
In the first jump, the para-
chutist will open his main
chute; release it and then
continue the jump with his
reserve parachute.

The second and_ third
jumpers will begin with free
falls, using smoke, and will
6pen their chutes at about
3,000 feet. They will leave
their airplane at 10,000 feet.
- The jumper will deliver a
football to one of the game
captains at the 50-yard line
just prior to kickoff.

Barring unfavorable wind
conditions, all of the jumpers
should come with 10 yards
of their targets.

Wildkittens
Face Evans

Today marked the debut
of the 1970 freshman foot-
ball team under the guid-
ance ef Coach Gene McEver.

The Wildkittens tackled
Evans Junior College from
nearby Concord on the prac-
tice field beyond the soccer
field.

“This could be the best
froup in the three years I've
been working with the fresh-
men,’ McEver speculated.
Although the starting lineups
for today’s game were not
definite, McEver mentioned
several individuals who
should be standouts during
the season.

Halfback John Webel was
expected to carry most of
the rushing load along with
Alton McCallum and Steve
Keller. Quarterbacks Mike
Allport and Eddie Petitt
were included in, the blue
chip group, as were linemen
Jim Purcell and Paul
Brewn.

Both Brown and the ver-
Satile Petitt have been
troubled by’ injuries but Mc-
Ever expaciets then in action
soon. -

Commenting. on today’s
game, McEver noted that
Evans gave ,last year's
freshman team its  stiffest
competition: .‘‘I realize there
is a lot of change in players
at a junior. college, but I'm
expecting a tough game
from them,"’ he’ concluded.

Parachute .

have changed Furman Uni-
versity from the league's

weak sister into a conference
contender.

The four JC transfers have
bolstered: Coach’ Bob King's

_-hope for a title. One is, the

quarterback, Jim  ‘Deleo,
who found his ‘way to Fur-:
man from Wesley Junior
College.

The junior from Long: Is-
land, N. Y. has completed
22 of 50 passes for 244 yards. .
He's an adequate runner,
picking up 154 yards on 9
carries.

Two lineman picked up
from ,Chowan Junior College
have aided the Palladins in
improving over last year’s:
18-1 record.

The pair are Jim Fair and
Peyton Barber. Fair. is a
220 pound defensive tackle
while Barber plays offensive
tackle. A fourth JC transfer
Bernie Tosthoker is a sub-
stitute defensive back.
‘Deleo operates the pro set
offense, relying on Carroll

halfback and is currently
averaging 4.8 yards a carry.

Byron Trotter is Deleo’s
favorite recelver.. The 60,
184 pound senior has cayght
15 passes for 145 yards. Car-
roll and Phillip Howle are
other prime targets Deleo
often looks for. oa

The Purple Palladins favor
a 6-2-2-1 defense with the
defensive ends dropping off
for pass coverage. :

The rushing defense is one’
of the best in the conference.
In the 23-9 upset over Rich-
mond, the Patladins held the
Spiders to minus 35’ yards in
the first half.

“The victory over. Rich-
mond is a hig-one in some..
ways,'’ commented Coach
King. ‘‘It could have a great .
effect on the remainder .of
our season, especially... the
conference games.,'',

‘Furman began to jell after
their 42-34 win over Carson-
Newman, Prior to the CN
game, the Palladins had lost
to VMI and Wofford, win-—

/ ning only against Presby:

terian College.

Coach King batt nothing
but pratse. for .Davidson:..
‘This is an important. game
for us. Davidson is: big-and:
strong, possessing an excel-
lent passing game.”’ :

“Year in and, year out .
they have the best conceived:
passing attack we've seen."’ |
