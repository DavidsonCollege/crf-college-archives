Charlotte Prods Spanky To Action

i]
By S. GEOFFERY SPANK

In the April 10th issue of The Asheville Citizen was a
story on one Charlotte Young, a 105-year-old poet who
was just writing her sixth volume. Now granted, her
poems sounded like the work of a century-old biddy who
was badly in need of a supplement to her Social Security
check, but still, she sure was having a good time.

So I asked myself, “Geoffrey, ol’ Charlotte here
spends all her time in bed and can only move enough to

bring her tremorous hand across the page to write forget- .

able poetry, and you’ ve got your health, your future, and
a guaranteed monthly check from Dad. So how come
she’s so happy and you’ re not quite?”

I was stumped. For one thing I seldom pose ques-
tions to myself so intelligently. For another thing I had
no idea how she could be so happy. Then, in a frenzy of
indecision, the answer came to me: goals.

Charlotte, when she was 75, decided, “I’m going to
write whimsical pretentious poetry from now until I’m
105, and maybe if I get good enough they’Il write a story
on me in The Asheville Citizen.” Well, sure enough she
did, and sure enough they did.

I finally concluded that it was high time I write a list
of my goals. I had heard somewhere that it’s a good idea
to get five goals or so, achieve them, and then set more. |
really didn’t see how I could possibly be happy sitting
and achieving goals all my life. It seemed kind of a waste
to be all happy and mushy-like inside with yourself, only
to realize you’ve got more stuff you’ve got to do.
Wouldn't it be smarter to just set a whole lot of really big
goals at once and start achieving them en masse? So] sat
myself down and commenced writing:

I. to take up philately.

2. to learn to fly.

3.‘to learn to turn invisible.

4. to live forever.

5. to learn to read minds.

6. to see into the future.

That’s the hardest step — deciding what you most
want from life. But the next step was not much easier.
Now it was time to develop a regimen for achieving
these goals. The regimen should be a daily schedule,
with a specific time set aside each day strictly for the de-
velopment of goals. Such a schedule would be:

—wake up

—think very hard of ways to achieve one specific
goal

—eat breakfast

—go to class

—eat lunch -

—study

—eat dinner

—have fun

—go to bed

The next step is to begin execution nof the regimen. If
you are trying to achieve a whole lot of really difficult
goals at once, it is best to spend one day a week on each
individual goal, with Sunday as a day of rest. Progress
will be real slow, but consistent with all goals (so you
won’t do that annoying set, achieve, set, achieve, busi-
ness).

After you do your regimen for a while, at regular in-
tervals look back to see what kind of progress you’re
making. Looking back gives you a chance to appreciate
the progress you’ve made and to reassess your present
goals,

_ This is the stage where I am. So far I’ve lived
forever, I can see into the present, I can turn opaque, |
can guess minds, and 1 can jump. But I'm really not sure

_ about this stamp collecting .
