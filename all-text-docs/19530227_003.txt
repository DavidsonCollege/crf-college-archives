With Duke March 28

By BILL-MORRIS
- Candidates for Davidson's 1953 baseball team begin work-
outs Monday for a long, 18-game season, which opens March 28
with Duke. Coach Cluck Clements, who coached baseball and
football at Gastonia High School before coming to Davidson

last spring, will be assisted by

Cage Mentor Danny Miller in

night sessions in Johnston gym until winter football practice

is over.

Last year the Cats won one game
each from Springfield, The Citadel,
Clemson and Furman while losing
13.

Returning from the '52 team will
be Fred Stowe, who roamed the
outer gardens and batted .457 for
the season, high in Southern Con-
ference standings, Outfielder Jerry
Morrow, Arnold Whisnant at first
base, and pitchers “Ish” Bennett,
Jim Smith, Andy Courts and
Johnny Smith.

Freshman prospects appear to be
Catcher Ray Harding and Corky

Johnny Gray may be shifted from
shortstop to second base because
of the shoulder injury he sustained
in football and to fill the void creat-
ed by the graduation of Johnny
Guiton. The absence of Jack
Branch, who also graduated, will be
felt in the outfield.

Coach Clements remarked today
that since he is new to the squad
he considers each position “wide
open” and is looking for “nine hust-
ling ball players.”

Matmen At VPI For Last

Dual Meet Of

‘53 Season

By ANDY TURNER

strong grapplers at Blacksburg

tomorrow afternoon. Davidson

goes into the meet with an 0-8 record.

24-Match Slate
Set For Netmen
This Season

Davidson's 1953 tennis team will
be the most cosmopolitan group
on the campus by the time the com-
ing season is over. The Wildcat net-
men will travel all over the eastern
part of the country, playing
matches as far north as Dartmouth,
in New Hampshire, and Williams,

in Massachusetts, to Kalamazoo, in| ly.

Michigan, and as far South as Mia-
mi University in Florida.
The 24-match season gets under
way during spring vacation on
Metch 20, when the team will
play Alabama Teachers College at
Jacksonville, Fla.
The complete schedule is as fol-
lows:
Merch 20 — Alabama Teachers
College at Jacksonville, Ale.

March 21 — University of Ale-
bama et University of Ale-
bamea.

March 23 — U. S. Naval Air

Station at Pensacola.

VPI Ranks high in the Southern
Conference, right béhind Maryland
and West Virginia. They have a
good, fast team and will almost be
too much for Coach Charlie Park-
er’s boys. VPI has beat both Wash-
ington and Lee and Duke who
both have topped Davidson.

Coach Charlie Parker will be
minus the services of Gene Craven
and therefore the lineup won't
be as strong as usual. Capable Stan
Topple will replace Craven in the
147 pound class.

Bob Key will again handle the
123-pound class while Charlie Mur-
ray and Don Reid go in the 130
and 137-pound classes respective-

John Buxton and Bill Coe are
scheduled for the 157 and 167-
pound classes, and either Bill Mc-
Elveen or Nabby Armfield will go
in the 177-pound division.

Roger Wright will take his usual
place in the heavyweight competi-
tion.

The win-hungry wrestlers, with-
out Craven, will depend heavily
on John Buxton and Charlie Mur-
ray who have been coming along
very well. Both have just one de-
feat in conference play.

team journeys to Chapel Hill to see action there tomorrow.

For Hambright’s swimmers this
weekend’s tournament is the cli-
max of the season. After a disap-
pointing season during which they
won only one meet, the Catfish
hope to make a fine showing
against the best of the Southern
Conference.

The ‘fish will have to win what-
ever honors they can minus the
services of sprinter Bob Patten,
who is currently in the infirmary
with flu. Patten was one of the
big reasons for the team’s smash-
ing 55-29 win over Clemson here
last Thursday.

With Patten out, the Catfish will
rely primarily on high point man
Al Ormond, who will swim the
1500-meter, the 220 and 440 yard
freestyle events, and Captain Jim
Bryan, who will be the Davidson
entry in both the 100 and 200-yard
backstroke events. Bryan was also
set to handle the backstroke in the
300-yard medley relay.

George Crone will swim the
breast stroke lap of the medley re-
lay, and the regular 200-yard breast
stroke event. Jim Golding, step-
ping in for Patten, is the likely
choice for the 100-yard freestyle
and the 400-yard freestyle relay.

Paul Cole will handle the 220
and 440-yard freestyle events, while
Charlie Haigh will swim one lap of
the 400 freestyle relay and the 50-
yard freestyle dash.

Eleven Men To Run
Up in Chapel Hill, Coach Pete
Whittle will be counting on cleven
Wildcat trackmen to win honors for
Davidson tomorrow.

Frank Mitchener, Bill Morris,
Roy White and Van Julian will run
the 60-yard dash for Whittle’s team.
These boys have had the benefit
of no regular indoor track on which
to practice, so Whittle doesn’t ex-
pect great things of them. —

Whittle will enter no one in the
high hurdles event, but has Bill
Morris and Roy White in shape for
the low burdles.

John Regen, a freshman, and the
versatile White will be the Wild-
eat entries in the broad jump.

Steve Gooding, Andy Turner, and
Homer Sparks will run the strenu-

son the Wildcat of the Week is
the captain of the Davidson cagers,
Joe Dudley.

The Winston-Salem standout wins
this distinction largely by virtue
of his brilliant 28-point perform-
ances within the last week against
Furman and Clemson.

Dudley, as any devotee of David-
son basketball can tell you, is a
rather tall slender young man who

stands nearly 6’5" and weighs by}; -

than 150 and something less than
200. Actually the best guess is
about 170.

This season he has constituted
the only consistent scoring punch

that Davidson has been able to}:

present. Since the departure of
Jerry King he has carried the brunt
of the Wildcat offense.

KAs Edge Out Sigm

a Chis

For Intertrat Basketball Title

By BUCK REINHARDT

With a one-point verdict over a
strong Phi Delt team the KAs cli-
maxed a very successful season that
brought them the interfraternity
basketball championship for the
second straight year.

The KAs compiled 10 victories
against one defeat to clinch the
first place berth. Their nearest riv-
als, the Sigma Chis (9-2), got off
to a slow start at the beginning
of the season but improved greatly
and took second place while giving
the champs a real scare.

A strong Phi Delt team (8-3) had
to settle for third place in the
standings, due to being the victim
of upsets over the course of the
season.

In winning the championship the
KAs displayed a furious fast break
with exceptionally good shooting,
Their team unity and never flag-
ging spirit also contributed a great
deal to crowning them 1953 Inter-
fraternity Basketball Champs.

Sigme Chis 43; SAB 37

The Sigma Chis, who were far
down in the race earlier in the sea-
son climaxed a great comeback by
topping the SAE’s 43 to 37, and
ending in second place in the
standings.

Tom Shaw was the big gun for
the Sigma Chis with 12 points while
A. C. Gregg led the losers with 14.
Kappe Alpha 46; Phi Delta Thete 45

In a breath taking game the KAs
clinched the league championship
by nosing out a hard-fighting Phi
Delt five. The Phi Delts were trail-
ing by 5

ing the KA margin. Their rally,
however, fell short and the KAs
grabbed a one-point verdict and
the championship. The combined
efforts of Bowen (15) and King
(14) gave the KAs the. spark to take
the victory. Ted Oldenburg led
the Phi Delts and took scoring
honors for the night with 17 points.
Pi Keppa 55; ATO 45

The Pi Kapps turned in the big-
gest upset of the week by trip-
ping the ATO’s 55 to 45.

SPE 39; Kappa Sigs 34

With Horace Ball scoring 13
points, high for the game, the SPE’s
nosed out the Kappa Sigs 39 to 34

SPEs took the lead at the start
and were never headed although
their lead was threatened by a
surging Pika rally early in the
fourth quarter. Moffat Ware led
the SPEs to victory with 18 points.
Lindley Beardsley led the victory-
starved PiKas with 12 points.
Pht Gams 44; ATO 42

It was neck and neck to the last
whistle which found the ATOs on
the short end of a 44 to 42 score
as the Phi Gams won their final
game of the season. Once again it
was Larry Champion who led the
Phi Gams to victory with 23 points.
Page and Gilley were high for the
losers with 10 points each.

Campus Club 46; Betas 42

The Campus Club for the first
time this season out scored their
opponents but it made no differ-
ence as the Betas won the game
on forfeit.

Brown led the Clubmen to the
imaginary win with 16 points. Bill
McNair was high for the Betas
with 18 points.

ATOs 49; SPE 47

With a really late in the last
quarter the ATOs managed to nose
out the SPEs 49 to 47. Murray Page
led the ATO offense, scoring 10 of
his 15 point game total during the
fourth quarter’rally which decided
the closely contested game. Moffatt
Ware was high man for the SPEs
with 17 points.

JOE DUDLEY
Fourth best in the Conference.

With 4-17 Record

By JOHN HANDLEY
Coach Danny Miller’s Wildcat Cagers wind up their 1953

season’s activity tomorrow night in Blacksburg, Virginia, as
they tangle with a vastly improved Virginia Tech quintet.

The battle with Tech's Gobblers
will mark the close of one of the
Cats’ poorest seasons in several
i years. As they go into this encount-
er with the Techmen the Wildcats
hold a 4-17 record. VPI last week
‘was in 14th place in the Southern
Conference, while the Cats held
13th, so tomorrow's game would
appear to be a tossup.

i The VPI cagers haven't been!
‘world beaters either, however, and|/!

:they also own a very lopsided rec-
‘ord. The Gobblers got off to a very
poor start in this year’s campaign
as they lost to such teams as High
Point, Elon, and Marshall. They
went for eight straight games with-
out a win before taking the mea-
sure of Washington and Lee's last
place Generals.

However, thc young Cobblers,
who like Miller’s Cats are in a
building year, have improved as
the season progressed. On Monday
night they took the measure of
William and Mary’s Indians who
are coached by Boyd Baird, Wild-
cat coach for the three previous
years,

Gobblers Want Revenge

In taking three decisive pound-
ings in as many outings in the past
week the Cats will be out to wind
up the season’s activities on the
same winning note on which they
began way back in December. VPI
took a 67-58 pounding from last
year's Cats and they will be after
revenge.

Two Wildcat stalwarts will take
the floor for the last time in a
Davidson uniform against VPI to-
morrow sight in the persons of
Captain and center Joe Dudley and
forward J. V. “Horse” Howell. Both
these men have figured prominent-
[ly in Cat basketball this year. Dud-
‘ley sports the Cats’ highest individ-
‘wal scoring average with a healthy

. 17 points per game mark.

| This has been Coach Miller's
building season as was easily seen
in the Duke game last Tuesday. In
that game at times the lineup fea-
tured four freshmen and one junior
and other combinations of return-
ing material for next years team.

Broken Anchor Five
Plays At Morganton

Ten Davidson students are in
Morganton, N. C., this weekend to
participate in that city’s’ semi-pro
basketball tournament.

Sponsored by the “Broken Anch-
or,” local cafe, the Davidson ag-
gregation will compete against
teams from all over this area.

The Broken Anchor squad is com-
prised of Arnold Whisnant, Jim
Smith, Adrian Bowen, Don Lazenby,
Lindley Beardsley, Don Menzies,
and George King.

The team will play in the Mor
ganton High School Gymnasium.

The Horse bows out tomorrow.

Winter Practice
Seen Progressing
Satisfactorily

Winter football practice has been
progressing “satisfactorily,” Coach
Bill Dole said this week after the
squad had completed seven of its
20 planned sessions.

So far Dole has been running T-
formation plays only, while grad-
ually rounding his squad into
shape. There are now 36 men prac-
ticing.

Sophomore Henry Brown has
been working in the quarterback
spot vacated by the graduating
Jack Ruth, and seems to be taking
to his new job well. Also working
at the QB slot are Bobby Amos
and Johnny Gray.

Another important switch has
Harry Peterson working at offen-
sive center, moving in for Arnold
Whisnant, who graduates this
spring. Gene Davis, Bob Loy, Bill
Elliot, and Bill Taylor have also
been working in the pivot man’s
spot.

The complete squad for the win-
ter practice sessions is as follows:

Corky King, Jim Patterson, Jim-
my Davis, Harry Petersen, Bob
Loy, Ben Craig, Gene Davis, Neil
Graham, Chuck Mauney, Bob Stroz-
ier, Bill Taylor, Dick Jones, Dickie
Davis, Charlie Cousar, Tom Owen,
Bob Patten, Jim Moore, S. H. Wain-
right, Bo Abernathy, Harold Davis,
