Winston Taylor, Sophomore:

I am in favor of a small band
for Mid-Winters. After all, the suc-
cess of the dance depends upon the
presence of numerous young ladies,
not upon the size of the orchestra.
A large band is too expensive for
a school the size of Davidson.

Dr. Hillhouse Announces Pub-
lication Of Work

Dr. A. M. Hillhouse, recent ad-
dition to the Davidson College fac-
ulty, has just announced the pub
lication of “The Call
Municipal Bonds,”

Feature in

book
which he did much of the work.

a on

Hillhouse, an alumnus of David-

son who came here this year from

the University of Chicago, stated
that, “This booklet was prepared
by me (at least in large part) as

secretary of a committee set up

by the Municipal Finance Officers
Association, and published in Feb-
ruary, 1938.”

He added, “The purpose of the
study was to ascertain whether or
not municipal governments would
profit, as have private corpora-
tions, from inserting the call fea-
ture in their bonds. The cost of
including this feature, as reflected
in a higher interest cost on the

money borrowed, balanced

lagainst the savings that might aec-

| calling and retiring the bonds earl-

lier than their maturity date, or

by calling the bonds in a period

of low interest rates and refund-

ing the debt into bonds with a
lighter interest burden
