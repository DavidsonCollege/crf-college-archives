War Prods Retum
Of Old Speedup

For New Freshmen

Davidson, N. C., Feb. 17—Un.
der a war-accelerated program an-
nounced today by President John
R. Cunningham, new students at
Davidson College will be invited to
begin their work in June instead
of September. Degrees may be
won under the program in three
calendar years instead of four.

Although the acceleration pro-
gram begun in 1942 has continued
in operation since then, special em-
phasis is being placed this year
on the optional three-year course.
An expanded .summer session is

planned for this year to answer |

demand for accelerated education.

President Cunningham said that
no changes are being made either
in entrance requirements or in re-
quirements for graduation. “Stu.
dents must continue to pass the
same number of courses and there
will be no relaxation of standards,”
he said. The program simply offers
more: time for study by covering
12 months each year instead of the
usual nine.

The summer session in 1951 will
open in June with science courses
beginning June 4 and others on
June 12. The second term will co.
ver the period from July 23-Aug. 28

Sigma Delta Pi

At a recent meeting of Sigma
Delta Pi and the Spanish Club,
held at the A.T.O. House, Dr. H.

trip to Mexico and Central Amer.

local customs and characteristics of
the people whom he saw.

During a special meeting of Sig.

PHI Debates Calling
Marriage Conference

‘Sex Emphasis Week’

To get the second semester un-
derway the Philanthropic Literary
Society installed the spring officers
and elected new critics and super-
visors in their meeting Monday
evening, February 5.

Bill Harris was installed as pres-
ident, succeeding Irving Stubbs.
Jack Stevenson received the office of
vice-president from Bryan Robin.
son and Herman Bell was inducted
into the job of secretary, following
Mac Bulgin. Tony Tucker re.
mained as treasurer which is a two.
semester position. After Mr. Har-
ris’ inaugural address, Bill Buckey
and Howard Paul were elected as
supervisors, Henry Hansen and
Bryan Robinson as critics. New
members were voted in and a list
of them will be released at the next
meeting.

The question was raised as to
whether the Marriage Conference
should be called “Sex Emphasis
Week” or “Biological Emphasis
Week,” whereupon a long and ser-
ious debate arose. Mr. Harris, an-
xious to prove himself a model
president, took the stand for the
“Biological” title saying that no
Victorian would ever say the other
word anyway and positively never
allow it to be put in print so that
posterity might see it. The oppo.
sition argued that the term was
not just since biology took in both
animals and plants. It was de-
cided to call the conference “Sex
Emphasis Week’ in order to dis.
tinguish humans from plants.

Family Man Directs Students

In Mariage Lecture Series

By SHELLEY BEARD
For a man to be married sixteen years requires a great deal

of patience and self-assurance;

for that same man to be the

father of four children requires an even greater amount of faith
and endurance: but for that man to be a successful authority
on marriage requires either tremendous hypoeri isy or an alinost

miraculous trust in himself and his
ideas. The man of course is Dr.
Hill who recently concluded a mar-

riage conference on the campus.

He says that his children are
just about old enough to start
challenging his instructions and
asking if they are really what he
believes. This tends to cause minor
friction but seems to be a healthy
treatment of ideas and keeps him
on his toes.

Dr. Hill began his marriage dur-
ing the slump of the depression and
spent his honeymoon in graduate
school. At the time he had an ap-
pointment which paid $250 a year.
With this and what he had saved
from R.O.T.C. camp he managed
to survive. ~

As assistant director of the Union
at the University of Wisconsin Mr.
Reuben Hill began his career with
a background in psychology and
sociology. During this time he was
asked to draw up plans for a mar-
tiage conference similar to the Da.
vidson program which was to be
given on the Wisconsin campus.
Out of this conference caine a pe.
tition from eleven hundred students
asking that a permanent seat for a
marriage professor be set up. Pres-

NEWS ITEMS

Phi Mu Alpha, honorary music
fraternity, annouces that it will
present Miss Elynor Bryson, so-
prano, in a program for the student
body in chapel on Friday, February
23.

Miss Bryson was first place win-
ner of the Southern Symphony Au.
ditions for young soloists of the
south. Last year she also won the
auditions for an appearance with the
Charleston Symphony Orchestra.
She has appeared in concert with
these orchestras, and was a soloist
at the Transylvania Music Camp
in Brevard, N. C. this past summer.

At present, Miss Bryson is study.
ing at Erskine College in South Ca.
rolina. Phi Mu Alpha is very happy
to present her here, and hopes that
the student body will enjoy the
program next Friday.

ident Dykstra recommended that
the faculty submit a name of a
man to take this seat and Hill was
nominated, In order to hold the
position Dr. Hill had to study
psychiatry, anthropology and = ad-
vanced phases of psychology. Out
of this study came many papers
and the first of his books that have
labeled him as an cxpert,on marri.
age and family relations. At the
present time he and his staff are
working to find out: what effect the
removal of the father from the
home has had on the family.

The most rewarding aspect of
his work and perhaps the most
interesting is watching the growth
and change of students who come
to him with a full set of answers
to every question. It is necessary
to challenge these preconceived
ideas and start the student to think-
ang. Due to modern advertising,
popular literature and family no-
tions the task is somewhat diffi.
cult; but by taking advantage of
the pertinent parts of this material
and by weaving in other tested
theories a useful pattern of thought
can be cbtained.

In his trips all over the country
and to al! types of schools Dr.
Hill has found that response to his
lectures is universal. Coed. schools
do not seem to have any edge in
representation over otheg types of
colleges. The explanation seems to
be that the desire for information
on marriage is prevalent among
all young people regardless of the
circumstances.

The purpose of his visit like that
of his visits to other schools, is not
to present a one.shot course in
marriage and family relations; but
to leave a nucleus for, further
thought and action toward a per-
manent department devoted to pre.
paring students to face family prob-
lems, After all, Dr. Hill observed,
marriage requires a preparation
just as a profession and Davidson
students should realize this.

Banquet Will Mark

a j Campus Frat. Union

At 6:30 on Friday night in the
college dining hall Phi Delta Theta,
Beta Theta Pi and Sigma Chi will
join hands to observe the second
annual Miami Triad banquet to
be held on the Davidson campus.
Howard Paul, an affiliate of Sigma
Chi, wilt act as master of ceremon.
ies and the entertainment for the
evening will be furnished by repre.
sentatives from the three fraterni-
ties.

These three fraternities, founded
at Miami University in Ohio, are
generatly known as the Miami
Triad. Each of them has estab.
lished chapters in more than one
hundred colleges. Their system of
organization and administration has
been adopted and adapted by iiost
nationally recognized fraternities.

The Miami Triad became a real-
itv at Davidson in 1948 when the
present chapter of Sigma Chi was
founded here. Beta Theta Ui has
the distinction of being the first
fraternity to organize a chapter at
Davidson when they came to the
campus in 1858. In 1928 the first
representative chapter of Phi Delta
Theta was organized on our cam.
pus.

This banquet is a historical uc-
casion in the fact that-it is one of
the first such functions of the
joint members of the Triad to be
held at Davidson.

“If you want to watch an in.

just drop over: to the Commons

watch the would-be sorority gals
take out their Preference banquet
