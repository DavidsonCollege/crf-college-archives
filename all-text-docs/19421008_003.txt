THE DAVIDSONIAN

Frosh Preview

After watching a somewhat ragged intra-squad game last
Friday, we are interested to see how this year’s frosh eleven
will stack up in its first actual competMion of the season, when
they take the field) tomorrow against the Scotties of Ea LOT
Whether the junior college rivals will provide much real compe
tition is doubtful, but supporters of the Wittens should be able
to get a fair idea of how well the boys are going to play together
against the most formidable Opponents the Freshmen have
taken on im years,

Many are of the opinion that the schedule-arrang-

ers waited a year too late to tackle such yearling

teams as N. Carolina, S. Carolina, and N. C. State.

all of whom are consistently outstanding in conference

circles. They were pretty sure that last year’s fast,

powerful, and polished team would have fared well with

the best of ’em if given a chance.

Phere are several bright spots looming already in- this
years team, but as evidenced in last week's practice game,
they have noteyet developed the unfty ‘and poise necessary
to win tough ball games. There are plenty of talénted backs,
as usuak with Gwyn Pletcher (the biggest boy to come from
Barium vet) the chief standout. Ino the line it: will be the

same old Davidson story of not much weight, but plenty of

hight. Coach Shepard is working the players hard on funda
mentals and team spirit with the help of student assistants
“Lard” Royster and Ashby Dicks Since the frosh games are
the only games scheduled on the campus this year. and in view
of -the outstanding opposition they will-face, student interest
in Freshman football should be at a new high this season.
On To Blacksburg
Confused and disillusioned by~ their ° stinging
defeat at the hands of Rollins, it is hard for the Wild-
cats to muster the spirit to carry them through
against the strong V.P.I. Gobblers. ~ But they have

PONY BACKS

The above combination has born the brunt of the backfield duties for the Wildcats to date.
Davidson scat backs, they make up in speed, fine running and passing what they lack in weight.
