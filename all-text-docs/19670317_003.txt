Vassar, Yale Plan
As Hamilton Builds

By BOB TRAVERS
Managing Editor

The prospective move of
Vassar College to New Haven
so that it can be near Yale
is indicative of a trend be-
coming common in_ higher
education, especially at small
and non-coed schools.

Although Vassar’s proposed
move has received much pub-
licity in recent months, other
institutions have done far
more toward realizing some
sort of a coeducational system
on previously non-coed cam-
puses.

Hamilton College. a liberal
arts school with a student
body of about 840. is in the
process of establishing the
first of a series of coordinate
colleges which will share some
facilities, but maintain others
individually on separate cam-
puses.

The first of the coordinate
colleges, to be known as Kirk-
land College. will open’ to
about 600-650 women in the
fall of 1968. That will be seven
years after the plan was ori-
ginally agreed upon.

publicity director. It will have
its own campus, administra-
tion, trustees and to a large
extent its own faculty.

For upper level courses,
however, the two colleges will
share faculty, members to
some extent, according to the
Hamilton official, They will
also share facilities like the
library and science and re-
search facilities which Hamil-
ton has already.

Kirkland, similarly. will
have facilities which Hamil-
ton men will be able to uti-
lize. The two colleges will at-
tempt to complement each
other in that one will try to
emphasize
and areas in which the other
is weak or. as the Hamilton
official expressed it. ‘‘non-
existent.”

Hamilton has a faculty num-
bering about 85: Kirkland.
which will have a_ student
body about three fourths the
size of Hamilton's will have
about 65 faculty members. A
president: and other adminis-
trative officials have already
been hired.

Meanwhile, Vassar and Yale
continue to study the propos-
ed move. There are, despite
strong support from  Vas-

those disciplines -

sar’s students and faculty for
the move, many obstacles to
making such a move.

Vassar's 950 acre campus in
Poughkeepsie, N. Y.. a medi-
um-sized Hudson-river city,
must be sold—and necessar-

ily, according to the terms of |

a Vassar inheritance, it must
be sold to another college
which will use the facilities as
a campus.

There are other obstacles
also, such as Poughkeepsie’s
natural objection to the move
and the question of whether
or not the two schools can
maintain their basic goals and
objectives if the move is real-
ized.

The official positions of the
two schools are reserved.
Vassar’s President Simpson
has emphasized the problems
involved.

Yet the prospect of moving
Vassar is academic to neither
side of the proposed ‘mer

Girls At

(ED. NOTE: In the follow-
ing article, Stella Spencer,
Vassar English major, eval-

uates the Vassar woman’s at- |

titude toward a possible move
to New Haven.)

Most Vassar girls are en-
thusidetically ready to jump
into Yale’s opened arms. The
decision to establish the Yale-
Vassar study group seetns to
be a necessity in today's de-
manding era of education.

Students are no longer con
tented with the limitations im
posed by a small isolated col
lege. The fragmented exist-
ence of a separate education
is not a viable way of life—
if even for four btief years.

An automonous coordinate
school, operating within a uni-
versity environment, would be
an ideal solution to our prob
lem.

Should Vassar be relocated
in New Haven. it would not
lose its identity. Association
with Yale's diversity of schol-
astic and cultural offerings
would greatly enrich our cur-
riculum.

The obstacles in moving to
New Haven seem overwhelm-

MacCormac’s New Campus Concept Gives Girls Key Role

(ED. NOTE: THE DAVID:
SONIAN presents the fotlow-
ing interview with Professor
Earl MacCormac which was
conducted by Staffer Sam
Darby.)

THE DAVIDSONIAN: Dr.
MacCormac. it has become
known generally that you are
interested in making this cam-
pus co-educational sometime
in the next ten or twenty
‘years,

MacCORMAC: Well, I'm inter-
ested in more than a co educa-
tional campus. I'm thinking in
terms of enlarging the present
student body in several direc-
tions. Really, it does not make
an awful lot of sense to edu-
cate males alone or females
alone: it's much more normal
in a co educational context.
In other words. one of the
dimensions of education is the

social life as well as what we
now call the intellectual life. I
also think that on several other
levels it is a matter of enlarg-
ing the student body and pre-
serving the integral whole of
the small campus.

I want more students and
more faculty without destroy
ing the advantages of small
faculty - student relationships
and the way I propose doing
this is the following:

First I believe that all col-
leges like Davidson will not
persist as excellent education-
al institutions.

THE DAVIDSONIAN: Do you
think that Davidson is excel-
lent now?

MacCORMAC:’ I think it’s
close to being excellent, yes.
We're a very good institution
and with the right leadership
and the right work on the part
of the faculty and the students

-DONW'T TURN ROUND...

this could become one of the
most exciting institutions in
the United. States.

I hope that it will, But at
the same time twenty years
from now unless Davidson is
to change its present pattern
of education it will not persist.

Students will want to attend
institutions in which there is a
cosmopolitan atmosphere and
excitement in terms of ‘intel-
lectual vitality. For example.
things that a large university
takes for granted such as the
coming and going of speakers
weekly, political rallies. visi-
tors in professional and non-
professional fields we have to
work very hard to get at Da-
vidson.

I see in THE DAVIDSON-
IAN this year a lot of criti-
cism of the lack of Reynolds
lecturers. It takes a lot of hard
conscious effort on the part of

where a good education can
be obtained. However there
are very few good schools left
without women.

“Yale should remain male
so as to accommodate good
students who do not want to
go to a Harvard or a Brown
where young ladies (7) will be
in ‘their classes.’ he said.

On the other hand a sopho-
more Yalie remarked. ‘Yale's
system is not only unnatural
and undemocratic but also a
carry over from early monas-
tic education: ‘there just can’t
be a world of secular monks.”

Generally the faculty is re-
ceptive to the study. The move
would be to their advantage.
too: they would have the op
portunity of association with
others outstanding in their
fields. °

Cornell has absorbed its mi-
nority of women. Radcliffe.
once independent, is now. total-
ly swallowed by Harvard. Al-

though the “Cliffies': may like

it. it might just as well not
be a collicge.

Though most Vassar girls
have strong sentimental ties
to the 950 acre campus. the
general concensus of opinion
seems to be favorable:

the administration. the facul
ty, and the students to main
tain vitality in a smal! col
lege.

In a large university you
don’t have to worry about that
sort of thing because the uni-
versity is set up on so much
larger a base with so many
different departments; and on
a laissez-faire basis each .in
dividual block of interest is
bringing in faculty. visitors
from other institutions, from
other institutions. from the
government, from the church
to speak to their own little
group. :

For example. if vou have an
institution of 40,000 students
and you get two or three per
cent of the student body inter
ested in an issue then you have
a large crowd out to hear a
man,

At Davidson College if vou
get five per cent of the student
body interested in a political
issue or maybe a speaker you
have 50 students and we all
throw up our hands and say,
“Isn't that terrible?" or, you
know, ‘‘What a poor showing!”
but it's not any worse here
than anywhere else.

The difference is that we
don't have a large enough base
of students to insure some kind
of focus and enough size to
carry on interest in activities.

There is a physicist from
Stanford -his name is George
Pate — who keeps telling us
that there is a critical size of
a physics department. Well. I
believe that there is a critical
size of a student body in terms
of the number of students nec-
essary to maintain activities
on a voluntary basis.

If you're going to have
enouch faculty members to
staff departments, we've got
to teach more students. Our
present French department
with five or six men can only
cover a certain area of French
literature and interest in the

|NEW COORDINATE CAMPUS?

Coed Cost: $20 Million

By CARTER FUSSELL
Staff Writer

Dr. Earl R. MacCormac,
associate professor of philoso-
phy. -estimates that it would
cost the college $20 million to
establish a coordinate girls’
campus to the northeast of
the present campus.

MacCormac sees such a
campus as a possible solution
to a serious problem that may
face Davidson in the future:
being too small in a national
educational environment gear-
ed toward vast. complex learn-
centers with highly-integrat-
ed curricula.

MacCormac believes that
educational institutions the
size of Davidson College are
too small both for students
and facully to exist in the
future.

He says that many of the in-
adequacies faced by students
and faculty could be correct-
ed by a larger campus group
with which to work.

The percentage of students
who participate in political
clubs, drama productions, art-
ist series, and other campus-
related activities at Davidson
is no smaller than other col-
leges. The same percentage
on larger campuses just re-
sults in a larger turnout.

MacCormac estimates that
it would take 20 years or more
to build up an excellent col-
lege for girls adjacent to Da-
vidson. He points out that
many schools are able to take
advantage of other schools in
their area such as the Bryn
Mawr, Swarthmore. Haver-
ford systems of small colleges.

However, Davidson is not
able to do this as there is not
a girls’ school in the area that
would rank equally on an in
telleclual academic basis with
Davidson. .

In a discussion of a physical
plant to serve the needs of Da
vjdson and a “‘sister school.”
MacCormac said a targé re-
search library would be necd
ed. This would be supplement-
ed with reserve reading rooms
in residential halls.

“These residential halis
would not be the barracks like
dorms you presently have, but
would be living and learning
centers. Besides the reading
reserve rooms there would be
learning centers consisting of
classrooms. teaching ma-
chines, and a central. labora
tory {or computer learning.”

French language while with
eighteen you can begin to cov-
er many more areas in more
detail, you ean make provi-
sions for sabbaticals with rela-
tive ease. you can have great-
er professional competence
and you can begin to do some
very exciting things in depart-
ments.

Twenty years from now un-

less Davidson begins to grow:

in size it will not be able to
attract top flight faculty mem
bers. They will want to go to
the universities where there
are larger departments and
where they can count on re-
search with enough men in the
department to allow them to
take sabbaticals and Jeaves.
Now comes the issue of add
ing to the student body. There

ought to be one or two other:

small residential units within
half a mile of the central aca
demic facilities.

In this way you will enlarge
the institution, have enough
critical mass to support excit-
ing activities, have a larger
faculty with more competence
and still preserve a small col
lege atmosphere and relation
ship.

THE DAVIDSONIAN: You are
suggesting two other colleges?
MacCORMAC: Yes. this would
make three at least. perhaps
five in the future.

THE DAVIDSONIAN: Well,
isn't that a university?
MacCORMAC: No. it’s a fed-
erated group of colleges sim
ilar 1o the colleges, say. in
New England such as Smith,
Mount Holyoke, and Amherst
which are banding together in
a confederation of small col-
leges each of which preserves
the small liberal arts tradi-
tions but through cooperation
they draw upon the strength
of each other's faculties.

We have no institutions near-
by of comparable quality and
so it's impossible for us to co-
operate on that basis. There-

In order to put this idea in-
to reality the most difficult
task would be to secure en-
dowment funds for faculty.
The dormitories would pay for
themselves as they could be
financed through government
loan funds that would be re-
paid from student room fees.

student has suggested that the

dio center. In addition a new

DAVIDSONIAN

REPORT

THE DAVIDSONIAN REPORT this week presents a
study of the possibility of establishing a coordinate women’s
college near the Davidson campus. The Report considers
the problems and potentialities of such a plan and deals
with the mechanics of its implementation.

The report also includes a brief look at what other col-
leges—Hamilton, Vassar and Vale—have been doing in this
area, and features an analysis of the proposed Vassar-Yale

merger by a Vassar junior.

MacCormac estimates that
$12.5 million of the projected
$20 million cost would be
needed to enlarge the faculty
to 90. The remainder would go
to supplement the psysical
plant.

MacCormac noted that a
much larger cultural center
for the fine arts would be’
needed because girls tend to

fore. we should develop resi-
dential campuses with central
research and library facilities.

basis rather than’ on these

Others feel for example that

alistic?

ural.

THE DAVIDSONIAN: Well.
sir, it's easy to say you're go
ing to have two more ‘colleges
but what are you going to do
about it?

MacCORMAC: The first thing
1 would do is to urge the col-
lege faculty and administra
tion to set up a planning body
such that the needs of the col
lege would be assessed.

If they decided that it were
desirable to have two or three
more colleges they would set
up a timetable and try to fund
these. Funding is not awfully
difficult in this type of enter
prise.

What is necded of course are
dormitories (and 1-would hope
that these dormitories wouldn't
be like the present ones); they
otight to have lounges in them,
they ought to have recreation-
al facilities, educational facil-
ities such as classrooms, a vid
eo tape center perhaps.

There ought to be a variety
of things in the dormitories to
break down the idea that the
dormitories are apart from in-
tellectual, social and athletic
life.

For example, there ought to
be athletic facilities such as
handball courts or squash

lion.

A girls gymnasium would
be needed to provide athletic
facilities for the sister college.

In time other buildings would.

have to be constructed, but
th ese MacCormac lists as
completely necessary in the
beginning.

MacCormac states that now
is the time for planning to be

courts in order to overcome
the idea that, by geographical
location, the funetions of ath
‘tetics or the functions of. intel-
lectual life and the functions
of social life are all different
entities because they are not.
THE DAVIDSONIAN: Are you
the only person who has these
ideas?

MacCORMAC: I'm sure there
are others who feel as 1 do.
THE DAVIDSONIAN: Do you
know of any?

MacCORMAC: 1 know of one
trustee who does and there are
several faculty members who
have at least considered this
idea. But I don't say there's a
great, wild gold rush type of
activity on the part of either
students or faculty.

THE DAVIDSONIAN: Why
not?

MacCORMAC: Most people re
ally haven't considered it. Now
T don't know that this Jeremi
ah that I'm giving you is cor
rect; it’s just my hunch in
terms of what's happening
elsewhere in the United States.

The perfect example is the
Sloan Foundation grants of
which Davidson is a recipient.
Each was given to small col-
leges because small colleges
were no longer producing as
many students who went on to
get PhD degrees in the sci-
ences as they did in the past.

At one time the vast bulk of
those students who received a
PhD in the sciences came from
the small college. Recent stud-
ies show that many more now
come from the universities.

One of the purposes of the
grants was to try to stem this
tide. I think that this will hap-
pen all across the board and
that the small college will find
itself at a disadvantage.

It doesn’t have a large libra-
ry, it doesn't have enough re-
search facilities, and only with
ingenious planning in terms of
what we have and perhaps

SCHOLARS AROUND ?

lion. It should be in terms of
“a cost analysts study of need-
ed building a careful look at
current trends in higher educa-
tion, and even a crystal ball.”

The best location MacCor-
mas says would be one-fourth
mile from the present cam-
pus with bicycles as the prin-
cipal mode of transportation.

As far as administration is
concerned MacCormac recom-
mends one president and
Board of Trustees to govern
the two schools which would
go under the name Davidson
College, that is the girls would
graduate from Davidson and
not another-named college.
There should be two sub-offi-
cers, ‘a Dean of College A and
a Dean of College B.

MacCormac emphasizes that
this is not an attempt to in-
troduce graduate work but to
set up another school of equal
academic and cultural ability.
The two schools acting togeth,
er could aid in adding much to
this area and provide the need-
ed cultural opportunities that
are now Jacking.

It would take 6-8 or even 10
years, estimates MacCormac,
before this new school could
operate, but he says now is the
time to begin planning.

shifting our values to smaller
colleges in a federation will we
be able to compete.
THE DAVIDSONIAN: Look.
my assignment was to talk to
you about having girls here.
bul you seem to take girls for
granted.
MacCORMAC: No. I don’t take
girls for granted.
THE DAVIDSONIAN: What I
mean is that you don't think
there's any question of wheth-
er or not they should be here?
MacCORMAC: Well. I'm sure
there are questions. Personal-
ly I have very few. They're
going to create a lot of: prob-
lems such as normal relation-
ships between men and women
and for a dean of. students it
would be horribly complicated.
You would have to have a
dean of women. and incur all
kinds of social: and sexual
problems. but 1 think they
should be welcomed rather
than feared,

If you do this, it makes the
administrators’ and the facul-
ties’ and the students’ lives on
the whole more. complicated.
but the end result would be
that young men and. young
women learn to live together
on a quite normal and low
pressure basis.

These male students that we
now have will begin to learn
how ‘the feminine mind, works
in the classroom as well as on
the weekend.

THE DAVIDSONIAN: So, in
summary. what you really
want to do is expand the cam-
pus. and the natural step to-
ward a realistic atmosphere
would be a campus for women.
MacCORMAC: Well, I hope it
would be realistic. I recognize
it would bring lots of prob-
lems with it. but again I em-
phasize that these are prob-
lems which must be faced aft-
er college and so I think we
must learn to cope with them
now.
