While the Davidsonian Sports
staff had car troubles on I-77 and

couldn’t reach

Huntington,
W.Va., the Wildcats encountered
their own roadblocks on Monday
night, losing at Marshall, 76-70.

Witha win, the Wildcats would
have earned a tie with the Thunder-
ing Herd atop the North Division
standings.

Davidson (11-9, 5-4 SC) blew
an 11-point lead in the final 8:54; as
the Herd (15-5, 7-2) rallied behind
a rabid home crowd of 4,614 to put
together a 30-13 game-ending run.

“We rushed and forgot to do
the little things and the details,”
said coach Bob McKillop.

“That rushing happened be-
cause the crowd had emotionally
pressured us. Without a doubt, that
was the biggest impact any place

had on our performance this year.”

With the score knotted at 44
with 12:34 left, David Burns scored
seven points in the next two min-
utes, and Mark Donnelly and Davor
Halbauer added layups in the run to
give the Wildcats a game-high 57-
46 advantage.

But Marshall controlled play
from that point on, as Keith Veney
- the nation’s second-leading three-
point shooter - scored ten of his 16
points down the stretch. :

John Brannen (21 points) and
Sidney Coles (20 points, 7 assists)
each added six in the decisive late-
game spurt.

Mark Donnelly struggled all
night, missing all ten of his three-
pointers to finish with five points.

DAVIDSON, Feb. 6 - Cau-
tion. David Burns is flammable.
Coming off a career-high 18-

point performance at Marshall,
Burns continued his torrid shoot-
new personal
standard
19 points in a 73-64 Wildcat non-
conference victory over Siena.

“David continues to grow and

prosper,” said coach Bob
McKillop. “Tonight was a classic
example of someone taking an-
other step forward and I’m
thrilled.”

Narcisse Ewodo and Chadd
Holmes also played key roles in
the win. Ewodo led the Wildcats
‘with 21 points and Holmes notched
his first career double-double,
dropping in 16 points and grab-
bing a career-high 12 rebounds.

gave the Wildcats a 39-27 inter-
mission advantage.

In the second half, the out-
come of the game was never in
doubt. An Ewodo jumper at the
12:47 mark put Davidson up by
20 at 53-33. The final nine-point
margin marked the closest Siena
ever got.

The Wildcats’ presssure de-
fense seemed to confuse the Saints,
who were held to 35% shooting
from the floor.

“T didn’t like what happened
with our traps in the first half (in

which Siena shot 42%),” said
McKillop. “I thought our traps
were a little soft. We let people
out, we let passes out. I think in
the second half (30%), we be-
came much more agrressive.”
McKillop’s emphasis seems
to have rubbed off on Burns.
While his offensive numbers are

“I’ve never had problems
scoring, but my defense and re-
bounding have really been sus-

Scorebox from page 13:

Burns filled some of the scor-
ing void, pouring in a then career-
best 18 points in just 11 minutes.

The 6-7 offensive superstar
nailed 4-of-6 from beyond the arc
and also contributed a career high
four rebounds.

“What’s encouraging about
David is not his explosiveness or
his scoring ability,” McKillop
pointed out.

“We’ve always known that’s
been there. What’s encouraging is
he’s learning to rebound and de-
fend. He’s learning to focus on
things beyond the offensive end of
the basketball court.”

Narcisse Ewodo led Davidson
with 18 points and Landry
Kosmalski added a dozen.

He has been doing some vol-

“It’s not as competitive as it is
over here,” Alpert said Thursday

“Tt’s very different to play over
there for guards, but the enjoyment
I get out of basketball is still there.”
