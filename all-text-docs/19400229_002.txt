in school from Freshmen to Sen-

Given: you love a girl.

To prove: that she loves you.

Proof: —

2. Your girl is all the world’ to
you. (Evident).

3. Your girl loves a lover. (Sub-
stitute 2 in 1).

4. You are a lover, (Hypothesis),

Conclusion: Therefore your girl
loves you.

Now try and make your girl be-
lieve it. The only rub comes -in the
third pdint; maybe somebody else
is a lover too as it often proves the
case. You're being It, you can, and
