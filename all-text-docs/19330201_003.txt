& . ILLUSIO

KEPT FRESH
IN THE WELDED
HUMIDOR PACK

This very old illusion was invented by Indian
fakirs. The secret was unearthed in 1849 by the
great magician, Robert-Houdin. At that time, ether
had just been discovered, and little was known
about it. Houdin claimed that he had discovered
that this new anesthetic could make people light as
air. To prove it, he caused the subject to rise into
the air and float apparently suspended. He passed
a hoop around the body to show there were no
wires or supports.

EXPLANATION:

There are many, many explanations for this old
trick. One is that the girl wears a concealed harness,
which ends in a socket between her shoulder blades.
This is*attached to a piston below the stage. The
piston is pushed up from below, causing her to
rise in the air. The piston is invisible, because it
is covered with mirrors which reflect surrounding
draperies, similar to the background. The magi-
cian can pass the hoop over her body because it
is cut in one place. It can be pulled apart for a
second when it passes the piston.

TOBACCOS

IN A MATCHLESS BLEND

Copyright, 1933, B. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

—__— NO TRICKS
.- JUST COSTLIER

let's fun to be fooled —

...its more tun to KNOW

Another “magic show” is cigarette adver-
tising.

One of its greatest tricks is the é/lusion
that cigarettes can be made miraculously
“MILD” through manufacturing methods.

THE EXPLANATION: All popular cigarettes
today are made in modern sanitary factories
with up-to-date machinery. All are—heat
treated—some more intensively than others,
because raw, inferior tobaccos require

f

more intensive treatment than choice, ripe
tobaccos.

The real difference comes in the tobaccos
that are used. The better:the tobacco, the

milder it is.
7. It is a fact, well known by
leaf tobacco experts, that
Camels are made from finer, MORE
EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other
popular brand.

Thisis why Camels are so mild. Thisis why
Camels have given more pleasure to more
people than any other cigarette ever made.

It’s the secret of Camels’ rich ““bouquet”
...their cool flavor...their non-irritating
mildness.

All the natural, ripe goodness of Camel’s
tobacco is kept fresh for you by the famous
air-tight, welded Humidor Pack. Don’t
remove it.
