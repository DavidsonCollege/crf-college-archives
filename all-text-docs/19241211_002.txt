The wrestling match with Concord Y. M.

the center of the athletic stage at Davidson
this week,
be a fast, scrappy event, as Concord prom-
ises to bring a fast, experienced team to
grapple with Captain Weems’ huskies.

For some weeks past the squad has been

be picked to meet Concord, These will prob-

McCloud; 129 class, Piggy Martin, R. S,
Wilson, and Barrington; 139 class, Hansel,

Davis.

Middle Weights—149 class, Phil Cox and
Estridge; 158 class, N. Patterson, Sutton;

Vance will be out on account of his recent
football injury. This leaves a gap that will
be hard to fill because there are practically
no experienced men in this class.

Heavy Weight—Laws Brothers.

Statistics that are printed below show that

the Davidson team outplayed the opponents in
every department of the game—punting, pass-
ing, end runs, tackle plays, center thrusts
and even on intercepting passes.

In the latter phase of the game probably
Popsy Hunt led the entire team. Several
times he, grabbed the pigskin from the air
: With one hand and sailed out,
be remembered is the way he ran one back
from the Davidson goal line in the Trinity
game to about thé 30-yard line.

Especially to

One of the most oustanding features of the
season was the 14 consecutive try-for-points
that ended with the final one at ‘Trinity.

After failing in the first three atttmpts
the team started in Asheville on the second
touchdown and thereafter failed to
kick the goal.

“SOOK” BOGGS
1925 Football Captain

Black, Hunt and Laird did all the kicking
from then on. Several times this one point
mean either victory or defeat to the Davidson
team.

Especially dramatic was the final point at
Pinehurst when with the score 10-9 in favor
‘of State, Laird sent the ball sailing through
the uprights for the tieing point.

At Trinity, with the score 13-13 in the
{fourth quarter, Laird’s field goal brought
victory. The final touchdown would prob-
ably never have come had not Flake kicked
this field goal, for the Methodists would
have most likely played for a tie from then
on. $

However, equally essential to this machine-
like work was the passing of McConnel at
center. Without a doubt he is the best pass-
ing pivot man in the state.

Nor should Sappenfield’s placing the ball
be overlooked. It is about as hard a job as
| the kicking.

| In rating Stephens, of Trinity, tackle over.
| Richie, Taylor no’ doubt received a great
| amount of criticism from those that saw the
| Trinity-Davidson game and who have fol-
| lowed Richie through the 1924 season.

Wildcat Five To
Try Out Power In
| The Concord Fray

The Wildcat Five will ring up the curtain
on the basketball season when Captain Sook
Boggs leads his warriors against the Con-
cord “Y” quintet at the Alumni gymnasium
here next Monday night. This will be the
only game played until the opening of the
collegiate season after exams and the only
chance to get a line on the Red and Black
,goal-tossers before that time.

' Coach Monk has begun work on the ma-
chine with five letter men and a large num-
ber of class stars to build upon. Besides
Boggs, letter men Tom Staley, Red Laird.
Mac Beall, and Speck McConnell are back on
the court and are showing the best of pre-
season form, The entire team that won hon-
ors in the Freshman state race last year is
also out and is looming strong as reserve
mattrial if not better. Class basketball has
brought a number of good men forward and
the majority of these are of varsity calibre.

In the Concord game Red Laird, Staley
and Boggs are as sure of starting as any-
one; while Litch Huie looks good to fill
Nappy Davis’ place at center. Tom Ander-
son, Hewlett, McConnell and Cook have a
chance at the fifth place, with Hewlett pos-
sibly having the edge.

The Concord “Y” boys are well into their
season, having played some four games, and
are ready to take on the Davidson aggrega-
tion Monday. They will no doubt run Dick
and Morrison at forwards; Bell at center;
and Moore and Hance at guards. Ed Mor-
rison is a former Wildcat and was a mem-
ber of last year’s squad. ‘

The basketball schedule as arranged thus
far has been announced by Manager R. W.
Oeland to include the following games:

DAVIDSON PLACES FIFTH
AS CAROLINA WINS RACE

Fresh O’Neal Leads Wildcat Racers
as Bailey Wins First Place

The University of North Carolina won the
state cross-country race held at Wake For-
est, December 6th, and Davidson placed fifth,
State, Trinity and Wake Forest placing sec-
ond, third and fourth respectively.

Baily, of Wake Forest, finished first in
15:45, running the three-mile course in good
time. Williford, of Davidson, was leading
the field up to the half-way mark, when he
fell and was taken with a severe cramp in
the stomach, ‘Stigler was also among the
first few, but he also became sick due to the
food that they had for dinner.

O'Neal was the first to finish for David:
son, crossing the finish line in nineteentl
place, his time being 16:15 for the three anc
one-tenth miles. Webb, the next Davidson
man to finish, came in twenty-second place
Williford and Stitler finishing twenty-fourtk
and fifth respectively,

The members of the Wildcat team did not
show up nearly so well as was expected, bul
none of the members dropped out. Consid-
ering the fact that 40 men started and that
the Davidson men finished about the middle
of the crowd, the Wildcat supporters should
feel proud of the way that Williford and the
others stuck in to the last of the race though
under trying conditions,

, Dick Grey at left halfback, and Hugh Ar-
rowood at right end, were the Davidson men
to make a place on the mythical team.
