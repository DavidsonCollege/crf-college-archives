Wildcats Have Great Season in
the Old Game of Ringing Basket

Win Ten of Thirteen Games, Seven of Them Played on the Other Fellow’s
Court—Coach Hengeved Due Much Credit.

1

,
The victory over Wake Forest on Monday night rang down the curtain on
one of the most successful basketball seasons that Davidson has seen in many

years,

The Red and Black Quintet has a record to be proud of and one to be

long remembered. Ten victories out of thirteen games, seven of which were
played off the local floor-is a summary of the season’s work.

To Coach Hengeveld goes the lion’s
share of the credit and praise for the
string of victories. Taking an excep-
tionally light team, in the course of a
few weeks, he turned it into one to be
feared and dreaded throughout the en-
fire sfate. His superb coaching is an
asset any college should be proud of,
and Davidson is not slow to recognize
the source of her standing in State bas-
ketball circles this year. But the whole
team worked together as never before
to put Davidson on the basketball map.
“One of the flashiest teeams seen in this
neck of the woods this season,” was the
tribute paid them by a _ prominent
Spartanburg newspaper. Teamwork was
magnificient, the passing superb, and the
shooting uncanny. Especially noticeable
was the goal finding ability of Craw-
ford and Mauze. Crawford’s long shots
added many points to the season’s total
while at the same time his opponent
was practically unable to ever get away
from him for even a chance at the goal.
Mauze’s tips and ability to follow up
long shots proved the downfall of sev-
eral teams. Ormond, the lightweight
forward, was always on the job. His
short quick shots went almost always

true.. Davis and Price played steady
games at guard, Several Freshmen,
namely, Mallory, Beall, Boggs and

Staley, started on their way to athletic
fame and ably demonstrated their ability
in*college basketball.

Among those teams who fell before
the Wildcats slaughter were:

The Charlotte “Y,” Wofford (twice),
N. C. State (twice), Trinity, Elon, Wake
Forest (twice), and Clemson. However,
Trinity, Elon and Guilford managed to
turn the tables and emerged at the long
end of the final score. Guilford being
the only team to shoot more field goals
during a game than the Wildcats.

The game with Wake Forest on Mon-
day night gave a good demonstration of
the real Wildcat spirit which showed
itself throughout the season in the team’s
scores.

The season’s scores:

At Davidson, Charlotte “Y” 22; D. C.
44-
At Davidson, Wofford 21; D. C. 30.
At Davidson, State 22, D. C. 23.
At Durham, Trinity 22, D. C. 18.
At Raleigh, State 21, D. C. 25.

Student Volunteers Going
to N.C. C. W. for Meeting

Eleventh Annual Conference Begins
in Greensboro on Friday.

The eleventh annual conference of
the North Carolina Student Volunteer
Union will be held at Greensboro on
March 3d, 4th, and 5th.

A representative number from every
college in the state is expected to at-
tend the conference. The foreign stu-
dents in the various institutions are es-
pecially invited to be present. Besides
volunteers and foreign students there
are a great many students who are in-
terested in the volunteer work, or who
would become interested if they were
given the chance to hear more about
it. It is expected that many such stu-
cents will also attend the meetings.

This conference, though known as a
Student Volunteer Conference, is also a
conference for non-volunteers. » While
the volunteers will gain from it great
inspiration, strength, and renewal of
purpose, many non-volunteers will be
led to find God's plan for their lives.
The chief concern of the conference is
that every student possible be brought to
a serious consideration of the question,
“What is God’s plan for my life?”

The first meeting will be held in the
Adelphian Society Hall of N. C. C. W.,
Friday afternoon, - March 3d, at 5:30
o'clock. This meeting will be a prayer
service for the success of the conference.
AfterNthis, meetings will be held almost
cantingally until the following Sunday
night. There will be three regular ses-
sions each day, morning, afternoon, and
evening, and each delegate is invited to
attend each meeting.

It is the object of the Exhibit Com-
mittee to make this feature of the con-
ference the most interesting and help-
ful exhibit in the history of the union.
Each band will place many posters and
curios on exhibit. The committee has
prepared a series of printed posters giv-
ing a short concise history of the North
Czrolina Union, showing the time, place.
speakers, etc., of each former conference.

It is expected that one of the out-
standing features will be a pageant, “The
Two Masters,” which will be presented
by the Meredith Student Volunteer Band
on Saturday evening. .

Davidson js looking for the conference
to be one of the best that has ever been
held. The following men have signified
their intention of attending it: W. T.
Baker, R. Bitzer, W. Z. Bradford, W. P.
Prown, L P. Burney, V. C. Hoye, T. F.

TRUSTEES DECIDE TWO
NEW DORMITORIES
ARE NEEDED

Authorize Additional: Dormitory
and Plan to Rebuild Chambers.

On the 22d of February, the Board of
Trustees, 25 in all, gathered at David-
from all over the South to discuss
plans*and improvements for the coming
year. The trustees saw the college in
and favorable comments
made on all sides at the way in which
the work of the college has been carried
on since the loss of Chambers, Circum-
stances were such that this called meet-
ing of the board was necessary, but it
will not interfere with its annual meet-
ing at commencement.

The heartily endorsed the
plans which have made for the
coming year and decided that two dor-
mitories instead of one, should be erect-
ed by next September, These modern
buildings will be well-equipped in every
respect and will more than care for the
lost rooming space. They are to be
lecated néxt to Georgia and are to carry
out the general idea of Dormitory Row.
A new central heating plant is also to be
erected, which will call for another new
building and this will be placed just to
the rear of the new dormitory.

The above plans will use all available
funds and no definite decision in regard
to Chambers could be reached as money
will have to be raised before further
work can be done, A committee was ap-
pointed ‘to investigate the advisability
of a canpaign for the required amount

be the best in the history of the college.

PRESENTED BY LOCAL FOLK.

the musical comedy “The Microbe of
Love,” played and sang its way to a
happy and successful conclusion. last

cast, the first act opened with a meet-
ing of the Spinsters’ Club under the
presidency of Priscilla Prunes (Miss Wil-
lie Henderson). After singing the Spin-
sters’ hymn, reports were called for
from each of the members recounting
their various adventures in the field of
Cupid’s art, but few and despondent
were the replies given. ‘

After several songs by various mem-
bers of the club, Madame Cupid (Miss
Elizabeth Cranford), who was  intro-
duced, promised to inject a microbe of
love into these bachelors who would not
give their heart and hand to one of the
She guaranteed that this
microbe, late from Paris, would work
with telling effect on even the most
stony-hearted bachelor.

Act two opened with a meeting of the
Bachelors Club under the efficient lead-
ership of Billie Bachelor (Tubby Wool-
fork). They recounted tales delighting
in their bachelorhood and each took
the oath of “No Woman for Me.” Simon
Shy (A. C. Brown), was then voted in-
to membership after taking a heart-
rending oath. After this followed an ad-

SCANDINAVIAN ARTISTS
TOGIVE .
IBSEN’S PLAY HERE

Two famous Scandinavian players are
to appear here on March 13th or 14th in
Ibsen’s great play, “Ghosts.” Madame
sorgny Hamer, of the State ‘Theatre, of
Zergen, Norway, is one of ‘the ‘players;
and Herr Fjilde, of the Royal Theatre,
in Christiania, is the other.

They will be supported /by an able
cast of seven American artists. These
two special players come from Ibsen’s
own old theatre to interpret him to
America. The play, “Ghosts,” will be
presented under thé auspices of the
Dramatic Club.

The company carries with it a car-
load of its own scenery and stage set-
ting, and it is believed that they can be
well adapted to the stage in Shearer
Hall.

The team played excellent ball in all these games.

Clemson Game.

“The Wildcats presented one of the
flashiest teams seen in this neck of the
woods this season.” This tribute from
the Greenville News in the write-up of
the Tiger-Wildeat game shows exactly
what kind of a Dynamite Five the old
Ked and Black is boasting this year,

With two games on the slate for the
South Carolina trip, Captain Crawford
directed his huskies against the Clemson
Tigers for first blood. When the Tiger
met the Wildcat, the fur
flow but it was all from the back of the
older sister. The Clemsonites were un-
able to oppose the flashy floor work and
caging abilities of the Presbyterians.
Never had Tigertown seen such fast
work as was exhibited by their visitors.
They were bewildered, startled, amazed;

its sister,

unable to wake up to the realization
that they had hit the scrapping Wildcat
Quintet. The Tigers caged the first

basket but this was soon overcome and
the visitors surged steadily ahead. Es-
pecially in the second half was the lead
increased—not a single time was the vie-
tory in doubt.

Crawford and Mauze were the back-
hone of the Wildcat game. Their fast
floor work and basket abilities enabled
them to pile up a gotal of 20 tallies be-
tween them, Ormond, Price and Beall
played their usual fine game.

When the: whistle ‘finally blew the
Wildcats had double the score of the
Tigers, 32-16. >
