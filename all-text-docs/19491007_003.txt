There is no ques:
tion about it. P. C. had
the better team on the -
little-worn turf in
Richardson Field last
Saturday. Those of us
who have watched the
Cats in action for the
past several years, us-

Cz

men, and thus far this
Year know that David-
son has better stuff
than a 27-7 humbling
by Presbyterian would
indicate.

However, it appears
that this fact makes By GORDON SCOTT
little difference to some of Davidson's irate followers. Ever
since Saturday’s contest, the athletic and public relations of-
fices have been flooded with telegrams and letters, most of
them leaning heavily toward the sareastie side. The only
criteria by which most of these writers have to judge Davidson
is the score of the games in which the school participates. If
Davidson doesn’t win, they immediately raise a howl and want
to know how in the world a ‘‘weak sister’’ like P. C. could so
completely manhandle the Red and Black. That question re-
mains unanswered in the minds of many of us.

EVERYBODY HAS AN IDEA

_ Several letters have come in remarking that Davidson
looked little better than a high school team. One writer sug-
vested that P. I. C. be added to D. C.’s ‘schedule next year to
replace P. C. and that Wingate would have been a good bet in
place of the Army game. Another communication said that
Davidson might like to get into the North State Conference,
now that Catawba has failed to score for the first time in 90
games. The public relations office received a letter in which it
was asked if Davidson was ready to withdraw from the Pres-
byterian,Charch after Saturday night’s game. Here is an im-
portant thing .. . all these comments haven't come entirely
through the facilities of Uncle Sam’s mail service, but similar
comments have been voiced by students and faculty members
as well.

Alt of this is bound to affect the morale ‘of the team to
some extent. H’s true that the Cats had a bad night against
P. C. last week. Blocking and tackling were shoddy . . . costly
umbles were made in the backfield and numerous bull’s eye
passes were dropped by receivers. But ‘that game is behind
uow. More important ones lie ahead. This week's encounter
with State should prove conclusively the road that the Cats
will follow the rest of the season. There are no ‘‘breathers’’ on
the sthedule. Every game will be tough and the Davidsonians
Imow they will have to play good ball the rest of the year in
order to break jnto and add to the win column.

WOLFPACK MAY EXPECT A '‘BREATHER”’

Tomorrow night's game with State is the one game among
all the others that Davidson would like to salt away. Both
teams will take the field riding a two-game losing streak thus
far this vear. State will be heavily favored, but they may en-
counter the same kind of trouble that the Wildcats had against
P. C. A writer in a Raleigh paper stated that ‘‘State should
have a breather against Davidson Saturday night in Charlotte.”
Where has that sort of a line been heard before? For the past
two years, Davidson has always made a good showing against
strong teams in Memorial Stadium and we predict a repeat
performance tomorrow night.

PRICE GETS PRESS NOTICE

A -clipping ‘from a New York newspaper came into the
athletic office a day or so ago which is quite a tribute to Mott
Price, considering the source. This N. Y. sports writer wrote,
“Price gave a life-like imitation of Don Hutson in Michie
Stadium last Saturday ... nabbing passes nonchalantly from
Lambeth. Turner, and Sifford. Price picked ’em off his shoe
strings or Jeaped like a marlin to spear a high toss.’’ This only
backs up all the praise that was heaped on Mott’s shoulders for
his scintillating performance against the Cadets.

Interfrat Football In

Limelight Again

By JIM SMITH
Betas 36, - Campus Club 0
Monday, the 3rd of October,
marked the beginning of the inter-
fraternity football schedule. Two
games were played. Beta Theta Pi-
Campus Clab contest turned out to
be a rout for the Betas. After a
series of power plays and passes,
the Betas gained a 36 to 0 victery.
Earl Smith and Hankins accounted
for two tallies each, with Wooten
and Allen each getting one. The
Campus Club, however, had ‘the
edge in first downs, 3 to 2. Han-
kins, Cunningham, and Red Davis
stood out in the Beta defense,
K. A.'s 6 - Pikas 0
The tilt between Pi Kappa Alpha
and Kappa Alpha was dotted with
pass interceptions. The KA‘s inter-
cepted 6 Pika passes, one of these
setting up the KA score early in
the game. Bill. Bird scooted around
left end for ten yards and a TD,
after failing to find any of his
pass receivers open, After that it
was nothing but a see-saw battle.
The Pikas recovered a fumble on
the KA’s 18-yard line, but KA in-
tercepted a pass and stopped the
Pika's only scoring threat.
Kappa Sigs 24 - SPEs 0
The second day ran almost like
the first day in its scores. Kappa
Sig smothered the SPEs by a 24-0
score. “Bo” Roddey led the scoring
parade of Kappa Sig with two TDs.
Williams and Evans split the other
two. First downs were in favor: of
the SPEs, 2-1. “Lefty” Hunter,
SPE’s ace, became the year’s first
casualty with a shoulder injuty.
Phi Delts 6 - Sigma Chis 0
The 6-0 score of the Phi Delts
and Sigma Chi did not represent
the true score. It was the Phi Delts’
game all the way. They racked up
four first downs to the Sigma Chi’s
none. The Phi Delts couldn't seem
to click when they got near the
Sigma Chi’s goal. The only score
was an intercepted pass by Whit
Cobb which was good for 60 yards
and a TD.

SAE’s 12 . PHI GAMS 6

The third day brought on the
thrilling extra period game be-
tween Phi Gamma Delta and the
SAEs. After the regular game had
ended in a 6-6 tie with neither team
gaining a first down, the SAEs
came out victorious 12-6. Good-
pasture scored both of the SAE's
TDs, while Abbot scored the Phi
Gam’s only tally. Phi Gams fed one
first down to none for the SAE in
the extra period.

Pikas 24 - Campus Club 0

The Campus Club received an-
other trouncing when the Pikas
smashed them 24-0. Jones, Fanjoy,
Collins and Brown scored for the
Pikas. Three TDs were pass plays
and the other was an intercepted
pass on the first play of the game.
The Pikas had also a nice run-

Hting attack which partly accounted

for their five first downs. The
Campus Club had two. The game

was extremely rough.

JIM SIFFORD

Wildcat Of

By CHERRY

This week we salute little Jim-
my Sifford for his great petfor-
mance Saturday night in a losing
cause. Jimmy was the spark for
the Cats all night long, and he was
all over the field on the ‘offen.
sive plays. Running those wing-
back reverses for which the single-
wing of Charley Jamerson is fa-
mous, Sifford showed his blinding
speed, especially on one long run
which set up. the Davidson score.
Sifford was the lone big gun for
the Cats against the terrific speed
and deception of the PC scatbacks.

Jimmy has probably never
played as good a game as he played
Saturday night in his four years
of play on the Davidson varsity,
although he has been a standout
in almost every game. Sifford, not
very big for college football al-
though he is solidly built, was the
only consolation fortna crowd of
8,000 supporters who gathered to
see a supposedly much stronger
Davidson team rofl over PC. Stun.

ned by two lightning fast Presby-

terian touchdowns in the -first
period, the crowd was brought to
life when Jim took a reverse from
the right formation and escorted
by perfect blocking cut around Jeft
end and into the clear before he
was finally brought down by the
fast PC defender after a 46-yard

scamper. Then after two pass plays,
the stands went wild as Sifford
took another reverse for six yards
and the score.

The statistics from the National
Collegiate Athletic Bureau show
that Sifford was the star offen-
sively for the Wildcats and the

Harriers Hope to Repeat Last Year's Win;
Both Grid Teams Seeking First Victory

By DAN McKEITHAN

North Carolina State and David-
son clash for the y time in the
renewal of their football feud Sart-
urday ‘night in  Charlotte’> Me-

Both teams will be seeking its
first win the ’49 seasow after
two opening defeats. but it will
be the crew from Raleigh who hold
the favorite’s role in this contest.
Nat since 1936 have the Wildcats
beaten State and not since 1941—
six games ago—have they even
scored on them. State holds a lop-
sided 24-9 edge in the series which |
is one of the Southern Conference's
oldest football rivalries, and six
games have resulted in ties.

Undoubtedly the Wildcat attack
will center around tailback Auburn
