Give All You Can...

Something was said last week about
the lack of any real sacrifice in this war
by the present student generation at
Davidson, splendid opportunity for
real help for the war effort and even for
sacrifice now stares us right in the face.
That opportunity is in giving to the Red
Cross-War-Fund, which is now conduct-
ing a solicitation for ~gifts
campus.

Early receipts in the local drive show-

ed a fair response: Average gifts of one
dollar each, single contributions amount-
ing to as much as ten dollars. But the
need great! The one hundred
twenty-five million dollar goal for the
nation is only a drop in the bucket of
all that is needed.
* Think for a moment just what the
American Red Cross does during war
time. It cares for the wounded at the
hattle-front, feeds and cares for the
desolate and-hungry, maintains-contaet
between prisoners of war and their fam-
ilies, the only contact.

A number of Davidson men have al-
ready caught the spirit of the giving.

and that already allotted to pay for some

shoe repairs. He gladly turned it over’

to the Ked Cross, Several others have
practically emptied their wallets with-
out hesitation,

A\t a hall prayer meeting last week
the Red Cross became the topic of dis-
cussion. A leader of the conversation was
one who had seen the Red Cross at
work in tornado-stricken Gainesville,
Georgia, several years ago. Before the
group broke up twenty-seven dollars had
been contributed to the Red Cross War
Fund.

Appeals for money are numerous
these-days,-but- when -the-real-issuc-is
considered in this case there should be
more honest, self-denial giving like that
mentioned above,

Air Corps Efficiency .. .

Davidsonians will no doubt lear
many little lessons from their associa-
tions with the army-cadets now stationed
on the campus. One of the first to strike
us is the amazing’efficiency with which
they carry out their routines, A group of
the men was detailed to do some clean-up
work around the gym, and they obtained
startling results. Ditto down at the
YMCA. We see through the results ob-
tained the value of the strict discipline
maintained by our armed services. Colle-
gians (those that still remain such) are
unaccustomed to such regular habits. We
are not advocating by any means any
change for civilian students, but the con-
trast does make us feel rather slovenly.

Campus Forum

Dear Legh,

lLast week there appeared in the Open
forum column a letter from a student
asking the townspeople of Davidson not ‘
to bring or send their small children to
the more formal concerts, etc. in Cham-
bers Auditorium. That is without doubt
a pertinent idea, but ‘it seems to me that
the student body itself is in line for
some reprimand with regard to Cham-
bers concerts.

Attendance at the various concerts
in the current artist series has been ex-
tremely good, I think, and the audience
has always been appreciative, but the
support (or lack of it) that this stiudent
hody has given its own music depart-
ment has been very poor.

This criticism is not thrdwn out in a
holier-than-thou attitude at all; in fact,
it is not really intended as criticism ex-
actly. It’is more an attempt to bring to
the students’ attention the fact that there
is a Music Department here, and at that
avery good one, and one that frequently

goes to much trouble to prepare and ,

vive a really entertaining concert free
to any and all who will come.

\nvone who has attended one of these
concerts recently has probably gotten
the impression along with me that there
were more people on stage than in the
audience. This sad state seems partly
attributable to the lethargic attitude of
the students themselves, and. partly be-
cause the concerts are not as widely pub-
licized as they might be. It is certainly
not that the concerts are not good. That
they are, whether you feel any great
appreciation for the “finer things”
or not.

The prevalent belief seems to be that
anything to which there is no admission
charge is of necessity not worthwhile.
1f-the-students-can-rid-themselves-of this
idea long enough to take a chance on one
or two of the concerts that Mr. Pfohl
and the other members of his depart-
ment work so faithfully to present, I
feel sure thatsthey will not regret it.

By SHAW SMITH

The happiness of having such a
fine group in the air school here
was momentarily halted by a most
innocent remark by one of them
earlier this evening. “Ho,” he hied
me as I rode away via bicycle: “Are
you the Western Union boy?” Ac-
tually it was complimentary. Yes, I
Was wearing my hat hiding any
pointed resemblance to tell-tale bald
spots! ... But we are glad to have
these men on our campus. No kidd-
ing. I’ve yet to meet one without a
purpose that isn't much more than
a bit of pretty flag-waving. Officers
and men who are possible future of-
ficers seem alike in earnest purpose,
desire to do their job well; to co-
operate in every way possible, and
to be with an unmistakable quality
of being likeable, 'Tis rather late
to be welcoming them now, but. the
welcome is most sincere ...

The talent display last Saturday
night. was not bad at all for a
bunch of amateurs. Jim McCrary
surprised many with his gentle wit
which flows freely for those who
know him when time permits for the
lighter side, (Sunday after he was
preaching at Matthews at the morn-
ing service!) John Turner, a good
bet for any team for dependability,
listed following as good behind-the-
scenes men (carefully leaving out
himself who really ran all of it) as
follows: Skirrow, L. Wood, P.
Welch, B. Hamilton, J. Craven, J.
Ramsey, B. Ingram, among others.
P. Siegel (meaning Professor,

job, which is not unusual for him—
nor his attractive wife in her own
field of art and drama, as well as
playing hostess, which means I’m
ready for the Waffles again any time
you are, Mrs. S.—She plays in
forthcoming drama by R:&B. Mas-
quers which goes on the boards next
week I'm told. News is that it is
good, really good, but it comes from
Lt Spencer, who stars. Anyway it
just couldn’t be as good as some
this year, and all that, you know and
everything. You see? But I'm going
just. the same and hope you are
there too...
And even more important are the
Spring Services which close Thurs-
—day—night—(tonight,—as—you know)
with Friend Dr. G. Mauze leading
thinking and good. living. At a
prayer-group*last week one of the
men who is not particularly a four
letter man (YMCA) made © these
very Four Star remarks: “There's
no denying it, these may be the
last religious services for some of
- us, because we can’t all expect to
come back after the war. This is
no time to forget about death, but
a time to make sure you are pre-
pared and ready to die.” . . Hope
you were at the services,,that you
go tonight, and more than that—
that you are out under the stars
some night or quietly at your desk
or beside your bed following: up
the purpose of the services. Don’t
wait, fellows, the time is now, . .
Yours, Shaw Smith,

The best rumor of the week was
that the occupant of seat J-5 in the
Junior Section was responsible for

tate to print some of the tales that
have-drifted-back:

Hotel Hectics: The casino on the
9th floor, operated by ole grad All-
cott, was popular Saturday night.
Bill Hodgin, better known as Coun-
try to his cohorts, was in fine shape
celebrating his last week-end as a
Davidson stud—he’s dropping out of
school to work for his Rich Uncle.

What did Long Jim Davis mean
by hand signals across the
floor to someone? He kept holding
up ten fingers and clapping his
hands. Could it be that he planned
to go to bed at 10? Who knows?
George Peters and “Jim Crow”
Lowry walked in the Raleigh Post
Office and collected their “sugar
reports” which had been accumulat-
ing, awaiting their arrival. Long
John spent most of one afternoon
in a telephone booth trying to call
one of his cuties over at Duke.

Pitch-and-Toss

CHARLIE BROCKMAN

Discovering the Glammer Within
You; or, You Too Can Be the Life
of the Party!

Last Friday night there were be-
tween three and four thousand-ex-
cited spectators packed like”
many sardines into Memorial Audi-
torium in Raleigh the
round of the-tournament
there. Everybody seemed brimful of
thrills and expectations and all were
having a rousing good time—that
is, all except one nondescript little
individual who seemed not greatly
impressed by any of the hue and
cry all about him.On-the-contrary,
this person seemed preoccupied with
worries of his own which were far
removed from basketball. Occasion-
ally he would realize that the people
around,him might be wondering as
his him-
self to give out with a little squeal
or two, but the results of his ef-
forts to sound enthusiastic fell dis-
mally short of his expectations.

The person in question was ob-
viuosly a foreigner, possibly-a refu-
gee from Wake Forest, but he
nevertheles§ illustrates a case in
point. He was the typical example of
a downtrodden, restrained person-
ality. Why was he downtrodden?—
because he didn’t assert himself! He
was in terms of “advanced psycho-
logy, a Mouse-like Individual.

All of us have seen at one time
or another such sad cases of re-
pression. Many theories have been
offered as to the cause of this
malady—possibly the victim doesn’t
get his minimum daily requirements
of vitamin A; maybe he has delu-
sions of grandeur, or perhaps delir-
ium tremens or some glandular dis-
turbance. At any rate, the predica-
ment is a most unfortunate one.

Mouse-like Individuals are gen-
erally rather frustrated people.
They are usually quiet and unassum-
ing, and always are letting them-
selves be trod upon by other people
—in fact, they seem to encourage
other ‘people to stomp on them be-

so

to witness
second

to sanity, so he roused

cause-that is the-only way that they

can remain downtrodden and un-
happy for any great length of time,
thereby continuing to be Mouse-
like.

Ask yourself frankly—are you a
Mouse-like Individual? If there js
any doubt in your mind, ask your-
self these questions: |

(1) Are you afraid of professors,
generally speaking, that is? ‘

(2) Do you feel that everybody

else has more on the ball than you
do? Heide uci etaisied
(3) Are you left-handed, and if so,
do you dread the thought of getting
up for breakfast?

(4) .Do you usually have a run-
down,“ droopy feeling just after
finishing the cake course in 10:22?

(5) Dov you find it difficult to
pay attention to the sermon after
a weekend divided among Queens,
the Tavern, and Salem?

(6) Do you see purple spots just
after doing fifty extended pushups

in your Mondy morning Phys Ed .

class?

If you scored one or more “yes”
answers, your case is critical. You
should take steps at once to assert
yourself, for you show very definite
Mouse-like tendencies.

You may ask, “How can I assert
myself?” On this point there is a
wide variance of opinion. Let us of-
fer several sure methods from the
experience of others: First, begin
by cussing everybody around you.
If you miss a class, cuss your
roommate for not getting you up;
if you get a memorandum deploring
the condition of your room, cuss the
janitor; if you don’t like your
cotrses, cuss the profs; and if you
give out of people to cuss, call up
long distance and cuss the operator
After a week or so of this you
will have begun successfully
assert yourself.

Now you are ready for the second
and final phase of your self-asser-
tion. You have established a repu-
tation for having a nice vile humor,
which commands no end of stand-

to

offish respect from your associates, .

who no doubt think by this time
that there must surely be some cata-
clysmic disorder in the flow of your
bile juices. Take this opportunity
to vent your spleen _on everyone
around you. Insult people. Call them
names. Venture to disagree with
any opinions anyone else may have.
Complain loud and long about the
cut system, compulsory church, the
rooming situation, or most anything
else that comes to mind.

Go wherever there are people
and make your opinion heard, and
if this doesn’t pan out, write,a
seathing letter to the Editor of the
Davidsonian. ;

Now you are a full-fledged as-
sertee, known to psychologists as a
Rugged Individualist. Of course the
folks around you will have other
more uncouth terms for it, but what
do you care. Ain't you got fun?
