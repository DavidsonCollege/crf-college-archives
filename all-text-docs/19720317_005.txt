Career Service Depends On Student Overload

After waiting in the vicinity
of four years, Davidson has fi-
aally established the Career/
Service’ program. Having the
most potential for providing an
alternative to classroom learn-
ing, the Career/Service program
could become one of Davidson's
most exciting learning oppor.
tunities.

These opportunities are by nu
means rigid. In fact, Randall
Kincaid, the program’s direc-
tor, hopes that most students
will take the initiative to devel-
op their own opportunities.

There is also the possibility of
a sharing of opportunity con.
tacts between the North Caro-
lina -Fellows program and the
Career/Service program.
Charlotte Area College Consorti-
um provides additional possibil-
ities for contacts and coordina-
tion of activities to expand the
working base of the program.

The problem comes to mind
immediately of how many stu-
dents will actually take advan-
tage of this program. Students
appear to be interested in get-
ting away from campus for part
of their college years. But it
seems that the success of this
program will depend on how
much the student is willing to
overload his schedule or go to
summer schoo! to make up cred-
its lost in his participation in
this program.

The faculty, the Educational
Policy Committee (EPC), and
Kincaid have all agreed that
specific credit for Career/Ser-
vice participation is not pos-
sible. According to Kincaid, stu-
dents can pick up credit for
these experiences through ex-
tended studies, independent stud-
ies, and the various ‘‘wildcard”
courses, which each department

The

has.

There is an apparent paradox
to this question of credit which
needs to be examined more
closely. According to the article
published in THE DAVIDSON-
IAN last week (‘‘Career/Service
Inaugurated”), ‘‘Positions will
be sought for their educational
value.”

This statement is a bit unclear
when one looks for ‘positions
of educational value”, but does
not recognize these experiences
as valid educational experienc-
es in and of themselves. Learn-
ing from experience is much
more valuable for most people
than any amount of classroom
learning. Yet Davidson can not
seem to tear herself away from
a tradition of. learning that is
quite stale and for the most
part very distasteful.

For any experience to be val-
id as a learning experience,
there is a need for motivation
on the part of the students. Yet
education at Davidson seems to
make learning a lifeless process
of sheer nonsensical motions.

A student is bound to learn
and retain more of what he has
obtained by spending those
same 10 weeks in three vacu-
umatic courses. In fact, a sup-
portive reading program con-
sisting of material from three
courses ‘no an area would be
much more meaningful during
a field experience.

Perhaps going to the absurd
length of analyzing this field ex-
perience in terms of hours spent
working would enlighten us. The
student will spend 40 hours a
week in the field activity. That
iS an extremely conservative es-
timate. Then he spends two
hours a night reading. For a five
day week his total education

time is 50 hours, which is five
more hours than is projected
for education on this campus
under the present term system.

Now let’s suppose that the stu-
dent arranges a field experi-
ence to include an academic
term and a summer. He has
now done 100 hours or more of
educational time, and if he is
lucky, he may get two or three
courses credits for it.

The point is that if Career/
Service positions do have ‘‘edu-
cational value,” then the stu-
dent should be able to receive
credit, full credit, for participa-
tion in the program. This as-
sumes that the student will have
a supportive reading program
‘0 accompany his field experi-
ence.

The Career/Service program
can be the most exciting edu-

cational experience to appear
at Davidson. Students should
give the program serious con-
sideration if they want an al-
ternative to classroom learning.
Students must also help those
people who cannot get out of
the classroom frame-of-mind to
do so if the Career/Service pro-
gram is to be recognized as a
learning experience of ‘‘educa-
tional value.”

ROTC Divides. Roommates;

War For Peace Continues

To the Editor:

I recently heard some really
encouraging news: Davidson is
second in the nation! But what
we are second in is discourag-
ing. We have the second largest
percentage of students enrolled
in ROTC in the entire United
States.

This outstanding fact about
our school was well publicized
in several newspapers as well
as our own ‘Davidson Update’.
What a fine reputation we are
developing!

Senator B. Everett Jordan
even took time out to praise
Davidson on this ‘“‘latest of
many distinctions which make
Davidson College stand in so
many ways near the very top
amcng institutions of higher
learning in the nation.” Exactly
how this contributes to ‘higher
learning,” I'm not sure.

I was looking through our
catalogue the other day and this
is what I found in the state-
ment of purpose: ‘Davidson's
primary purpose is to develop

‘Clockwerk Orange’ Swirls

A PREVIEW
By BOB WRIGHT

At 43. Stanley Kubrick has
worked his way into the top
echelon of film making’s intel-
ligentsia. His enormous creativ-
ity, his technical brilliance, his
exquisite control of his work
have made him into not only
the best established director of
the 70’s but also the new super-
‘star of the film cult.

There’s a lot of irony in the
fact that this brilliant dropout,
chess player from the Bronx,
has become an ido) for the
ephemeral ‘‘youth culture.”

But it’s suprising in a good
way, for Stanley Kubrick de-
serves all the praise he has
been getting lately; the man is
above all a creative genius and
today is a hard man to find.

His newest film, “A Clock-
work Orange,” {!s a swirling me-
nage of images, both visual and
aural. The hero, Alex (Malcolm
McDowell), and his drooge, Pe-
tie, Georgie and Dim, open the.
film at the Korova milkbar,
drinking milk-plus to sharpen
themselves up for a little of the
old ultraviolence and perhaps
some quick in-out, in-out.

Alex basically gets high on
two things—violence and Lud-
wig (van Beethoven, that is.)
From the very beginning we
like Alex. He is in fact the only
likable character in the film.
His wit is engaging, his intelli-

gence high, his charm delight- -
ful. He is also brutal, decadent,
violent, sarcastic, cunning, cru
el, and inhuman.

He is a paradox (perhaps the
paradox) of modern man. He is
eventually caught by the police
after one particularly brutal es-
capade and “rehabilitated” by
the new ‘‘Ludovico technique.”
In the process, he loses the abil-
ity to act independently.

Violence, sex and music, the
three most assertive, personal
things he does, are denied him

through this new treatment, a.

behaviorist’s nightmare. He be-
comes a walking denial of hu-
manity, a clockwork orange.

Grim though it may be, we
are exhilerated at Alex’s tri-
umph over the machinist forces
of his society. We sympathize
and identify with him, for in
the end Alex is all of us as we
might find ourselves in our
most dark and secret thoughts.

Kubrick is showing us some-
thing darkly tmportant about
ourselves. It’s not pleasant to
admit {t, but we all are ready
for a little of the old ultravio-
lence and perhaps some quick
in-out, in-out, if we get down to
basics.

I am a firm believer in the
maxim that all movies should
not be made in color, but “A
Clockwork Orange” is definite-
ly a color film. The visual work
of the’ film is absolutely re-

markable. Kubrick can take
such over-used and trendy tech-
niques as slow and fast motion
and make them work in new
and exciting ways.

Every film maker can take
lessons from Kubrick as far as
camera technique goes. Kubrick
is a master of the basics of
filmmaking and these exquisite
camera angles and movements
are what make a Kublick film
so special, and they make “A
Clockwork Orange” a fun house
for your eyes as well as for
your ears.

No one uses music in film
more creatively than Stanley
Kubrick, and ‘‘A Clockwork Or-
ange” is more proof of this max-
im. He scores a speeded up se-
duction scene with Alex and two
un-loving young ladies with a
frenetic ‘‘William Tell Over-
ture”; Alex’s visions of violence
and brutality spring full grown
from the demonic strains of Bee-
thoven’s ninth. Alex and his
draogs battle Billyboy to the lift-
ing violence of Rosini’s Thiev
ing Magpie. The soundtrack rec-
ord is as much of a prize as the

film.

In short ‘“‘A Clockwork Or-
ange” is a brilliant tour de force
of superb filmmaking. See it at
all costg. its influence will be
important and widespread and,
perversely enough, you'll have a
hell of a good time, O my
droogs.

men of humane instincts, of dis-
ciplined and creative minds and
of Christian character for full
lives of leadership, of service.
and of self-fulfillment.”

It utterly escapes me how
ROTC aids in the development
of men of humane instincts and
of Christian character. It seems
to me that this department is
even very detrimental to this
purpose. Training men in effi-
cient methods of killing does not
seem very humane and even
less Christian. How can a man
develop humane instincts when
he is constantly being trained
to develop inhumane ones?

I de not propose that David-
son do away with the ROTC de.
partment. I believe each stu-
dent here should have the free-
dom to enter whatever field of
study he should choose. How-
ever, I do wish the students
themselves would take a good
look at what they are getting
into.

We should, be dedicating our-
Selves to attainment of peace in
today’s war-torn world. And
contrary to what many say,
war is not peace and cannot
bring about peace but only pain
and suffering.

I should hope that if the draft
is done away with the ROTC
department here would fade out
of existence due to lack of stu-
dent interest. I hope the stu-
dents of this college can truly
develop humane and Christian
instincts and will give up war.
War is hell and ROTC is part
of war. PEACE NOW!

To the Editor:

When I received my recent
issue of the ‘Davidson Update"’
I was pleased to read that Da-
vidson was second in the nation.
That is, among all other col-
leges and universities in the
US., Davidson College had the
second highest percentage of
male students enrolled in volun-
tary Army ROTC in 1971.

What is significant is that Da-
vidson is a small college. The
voluntary student participation
must be relatively high to merit
second in the nation in Army
ROTC enrollment.

ROTC is only one facet of the
college education. It has been
pointed out that Davidson Co)-
lege seeks to develop men. “of
humane instincts, of disciplined
and creative minds and of Chris-
tian. character for full lives of
leadership, of service, and of
self-fulfillment.”

ROTC is a system of officer
training designed to produce the
leadership necessary for the de-

fense of the United States; this
system is conducted in a civil-
ian atmosphere in which stu-
dents are also trained for the
‘advanced specializations of ci-
vilian life.”

It is a very common miscon-
ception that ROTC trains men
in “efficient methods of kill-
ing.” Any man can kill, but
those who elect to enroll in
ROTC do not do so to sharpen
their “skill.” They enroll, for
the most part, out of a desire
to serve the nation in time of
need. Kill they will and kill
they must during a war to pre-
serve and protect their sacred
ideals and freedom.

No one who enrolls in ROTC
who believes in the senseless
taking of life will change that
belief; he cannot be trained to
develop inhumane instincts
which are foreign to his human
nature.

One further point needs to be
looked at. ROTC has supplied
the leadership of the Regular
Army in the past and will con-
tinue to do so with the All-Vol-
unteer Army. ROTC students,
unlike those in the military
academies, are not trained to
be professional soldiers. They
are trained to be “civilian” sol-
diers, whose civilian ideas will
carry over into their military
experience. This reflects the
unque nature of the American
military system.

No one wants war. But there
is a certain level at which tol-
erance to attacks on the na-
tional honor and integrity will
cease. Until war is abolished
and/or abandoned, adequate de-
fensive measure must be em-
ployed for the security of the
nation.

ROTC is a source of (officer)
leadership or the armed forces
in military crises—these officers
do not rely on war for employ-
ment; they are also trained for
civilian jobs. As long as there
are students who are interested
in the security of their country
there will be a demand for
ROTC.

Consider a paralle) in modern
society. American industry has
produced many benefits for so-
ciety: automobiles and airplanes
to provide transportation be
tween distant places in a short
space of time, electrical power
to cook by and to run machines
by, ete. But pollution unfortu-
nately also results, the destruc-
tion of our natural resources
and beauty. Pollution is hell
and convenience is. part of po-
lution. Really?!
