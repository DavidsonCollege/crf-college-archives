The volleyball team continued its
impressive conference run, sweeping
Georgia Southern and knocking off
Wofford in four games.

But they lost 3-1 Sunday to
Furman, a team that always seems to
have Davidson’s number.

“It’s a disappointing loss,” said
coach Lisa Marston, “but I’m not disap-
pointed in our team’s play. We haven't
beaten Furman in at least five years.”

‘The Paladins took the first game

‘15-12 before dropping the second 15-6.

Then they muscled their way to wins of
15-10 and 15-11 to preserve the victory.

“We need to keep our heads up and
keep working hard,” Marston said. “We

know everyone is after us.”

Other results for the Wildcats in-
cluded a 3-0 loss to Wake Forest Oct. 8
and a 3-1 victory at Georgia State Oct.
12. Davidson is now 10-11 overall and
7-3 in league play.

ese

The field hockey team went on the
road for three tough out-of-conference
games over fall break. They defeated
Siena 6-1, lost to American 4-0, and
outlasted Virginia Commonwealth 3-2
in double overtime.

Davidson won in convincing fash-
ion over Siena University on Oct. 11.
Their six goals were the team’s highest
single-game total so far this season.

‘The Wildcats fell to a talented
American University squad two days
later, but then bounced back Sunday
with a thrilling double-overtime vic-
tory against VCU.

Attacker Lisa Holthaus had a big
day, scoring both of Davidson’s goals
in regulation.

With the score deadlocked at two,
the teams headed into overtime, where
Erin Smith came through with the game-

winner in the final minute of the second -

OT.

The cross country teams ran
through dreary weather at UNC Char-
lotte Saturday.

The men’s team finished 12th out
of 14 teams.

Of the 15 Davidson runners, 13
registered their best time of the season,
and five had their best time ever.

Brent Ferrell once again led the
team with his career best — 26:27.
Rookie phenom Neil Burt was second
in 26:43.

The women’s team shocked West-
ern Carolina in a meet that included
seventh-ranked N.C. State and top 25
teams Wake Forest and UNC.

All but one of Davidson’s female
runners recorded their best time of the
season.

Wildcat secondary poses primary problems

By Micuae J. KRUSE
Editor in Chief

After playing reasonably well in
the first two games of the season —
both resounding Wildcat wins —
Davidson’s secondary has had some

FOOTBALL
Notebook

problems in its last four outings.

Three weeks ago against Guilford
in Greensboro, the Quakers’ potent pass-
catching duo of Junior Lord and Wil-
liam Rochelle shredded the Wildcats’
defense for a combined 23 catches for
316 yards.

And things haven’t gotten much
better since.

Against Methodist Saturday, Mon-
arch quarterback Brian Turner made
good on 13 of 21 pass attempts for 264

yards, and connected with receivers
Leonard Bellamy, William Ray, and
David Foster for completions of 48,
41, and 24 yards.

Bellamy was Turner’ s favorite tar-
get, hauling in eight balls for an as-
tounding 153 yards.

The 6-foot senior wide receiver
caught the 26-yard touchdown pass with
1:16 to go that gave the Monarchs the
victory.

“We've got good guys back there
(in the secondary),”’ coach Tim Landis
said. “We gave up some big plays. I’m
sure we'll get better and we've got to
continue to work on it.

“They haven't really had to throw
against anybody they’ ve played against.
They just kind of ran the ball on people
and hadn't really been challenged. And
we made them throw the football —
that was our game plan. They threw it
and made some big plays. We just got
beat on a couple big plays.”

Parvin continues to impress
Jeremiah Parvin, a 6-foot, 185-

pound freshman, averaged 41 yards on

five punts Saturday against the Mon-

archs. The rookie with the big boot
provides something the Wildcats have
not had in recent seasons — a punter
with a consistently booming foot.
“Jeremiah’s been punting the ball
awful well,” Landis explained. “He
brings us something we haven’t had in
the past. We’re real excited about him.
He’s been playing good on defense as
well, and he’s running down and cover-
ing kickoffs. So he’s having a good
year.”’... Tailback Nate Hagerman had
his first real strong showing of the sea-
son. The 5-foot- 10 junior, whois pound-
for-pound one of the strongest players
on the Wildcat roster, compiled 44 yards
on 10 carries against Methodist, includ-
ing an 18-yarder...Quarterback Tommy
Dugan suffered what Landis called a
sprained ankle midway through the first
quarter. Before the injury, Dugan did
not complete a pass in seven tries and
threw an interception. “We'll just have
to see how itis,” the coach said. “Hope-
fully there’s nothing broken. I think
it'll be day-to-day this week.” Backup
Matt Strader saw his most significant
action of the season, going 8-for-15
through the air for 78 yards and running

nine times for minus-23 yards.

Henderson, Ariail lead tackle parade

Rookie standout defensive line-
man Bo Henderson and Shreve Ariail,
the Wildcats’ stalwart at middle line-
backer, shared the team lead in tackles
Saturday, each registering ‘11
takedowns. Freeman Belser, another
freshman, and Chris Frederick each
pitched in eight, while Chris Hess and
Marcus Williams had six apiece. Four
Wildcats had sacks — Henderson,
Belser, Andre Carelock, and Ben
Spivey. Henderson and Williams also
recovered fumbles...Brian Langley,
after thaking his first four field goal
attempts of the season, has missed his
last three. The junior placekicker, who
is still flawless on extra points this fall,
missed one last week at Washington &
Lee, and muffed 37- and 27-yard at-
tempts Saturday versus the Monarchs.
“Obviously, I think the wet turf played
into it a little bit,” Landis said. “But
knowing Brian, the way he is, he cer-
tainly wouldn’t want to use that as an
excuse. He’s had a tremendous season,
and I know he’ll bounce back.”

Wildcats’ upset bid falls short, as Methodist wins

trated by W&L

run at them because they are so big. But we feel like
we run the ball pretty well.”

But Methodist came right back with two touch-
downs to take a 13-9 lead on runs by DeCarlos West
and Marcus Reaves, and things weren’t looking good
for the Wildcats early in the fourth quarter.

Davidson trailed by three and Methodist had the
ball with five minutes remaining. A defensive stop
was needed to assure any chance at victory — and the
Wildcats rose to the occasion, holding the Monarchs
to three plays for seven yards and forcing a punt.

The punt was then blocked by Chad Wright and
recovered by rookie Ryan Crawford, who took it
seven yards for the dramatic go-ahead touchdown.

Four weeks in a row now, the Wildcats have
entered the fourth quarter with a good chance of
winning..And four weeks in a row, the ball hasn’t
bounced their way.

“These guys are working hard and getting after

it,” said coach Landis.

“] think today’s game will be a valuable lesson
for us, and that given this opportunity again we will
come out with the win.

“T thought it was a tremendous effort against a
good, solid football team who has aspirations for the
national playoffs.”

Davidson's

third straight loss after a promising 2-0
Start.

Generals quarterback Christian
Batcheller completed 18 of 28 passes
for 288 yards and four touchdowns,
tying a school record for scoring tosses
in a game. The sophomore signal-
caller, a high school teammate of
Davidson tight end Wes Jones at Patrick
(Va.) County, bombarded a soft Wild-
cat secondary with passes over the
middle.

That, in part, helped W&L over-
come a 14-3 deficit midway through
the second quarter and race to the upset.

For the Wildcats, Tommy Dugan
once again sparked the offense, rush-
ing for a touchdown and throwing for
another. Running what has often been
an unstoppable option attack so far this
season, Dugan led the squad with 101
yards on the ground. He added 185
aerial yards on 15-for-30 passing.

Fullback Eric Ferguson scored
two touchdowns and Eric Sapp paced
all receivers with eight catches for 103

yards. MicuacL J. KRUSE
