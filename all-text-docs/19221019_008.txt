BIDDLE QUINTETTE TO
SING HERE NOV. 12TH

At the Y. M. C. A. service Sunday,
November 12th, the Davidson students
will have a rare treat in store for them.
Every college boy likes to hear a good
male quartet, and this is what the “Y”
is bringing here, with one exception,
this is to be a quintette.

Biddle University, of Charlotte, is
sending its five best singers, who will
give not only religious Selections, but
will render all the far-famed negro
melodies, many of which are so dear to
Southern hearts.

The upper classmen, who heard this
same group of Biddle students when
they were here year before last, re-
member their fine music and splendid
harmony.

TO DAVIDSON MEN
(Continued from Page One)

dent body of Georgia is nearly three
times as large as that of Davidson, but
we feel sure the Davidson spirit is one
hundred per cent equal to that of any
other educational institution.

The campaign will begin on Wed-
nesday. On Thursday morning the
returns will be received at Chapel and
tabulated on an adding machine on the

platform.

The men of Davidson represent the
finiest speciments of young manhood
to be found in the whole of America.
They. come from our best and most
representative religious homes, We
are confident they will allow no
thought of failure to respond to this
magnificent privilege and opportinity
to manifest itself, even momentarily,
in this great student body. Up and at
’em, Wildcats! We are with you to
the finish in a glorious task to be
gloriously consummated.

Gentlemens:

It has started to rain = looks
like it doesn't intend to stop anytime

soon.

Rain means muddy walks and muddy
walks mean wet shoes.

The result, wet

feet and a real old-fashioned cold.

Prepare yourself:

Take my advice

and buy a heavy weight; the first cost
is slightly higher but it will wear

twice as long.

And while we are on the sub-

GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY
FLUNG TO THE WINDS

The budding young business giants
of the campus lost a wonderful oppor-
tunity last week when they failed to
notice the swarm of bees settled at the
top of the water tank.

There was a cance for real money!
Those bees if properly hived might
have been the foundation of one of the
world’s great fortunes,

It is not often that such a chance
It is not every man
who can start himself on the road to
wealth with such a slight expenditure
of effort. ‘True, there would have been
some risk attached to the undertaking:
Bees have a very emphatic way of sit-
ting down sometimes. But what are
a few stings to the true seeker after
fame ?

Suppose some one had been ob-
servant and adventurous enough to at-
tempt the capture of these fiery in-
Ascending the tank in his
proper accompaniments of veils and
gloves and with a tin pan in his hand
he would have found it easy to induce
these honey-machines to settle.
he would only have needed to properly
hive them and the job would have been
complete. He would have employes
who would supply their own raw ma-
terials, manufacture them, and his
share would simply be to sell the fin-
ished product.

Think of the possibilities in this ap-
parently unimportant incident! In a
brief space of time this daring youth
might have become the Honey King of
Davidson. The zip manufacturers
would have had no chance against him.
The students of Davidson would
revere his memory as long as the col-
lege shall last. His statue would have
been placed in the Hall of Fame right
along with that of the person who set
fire to Chambers and the slick brother
who swiped the platinum from ‘the
chemical laboratory.

But alas, foresighted men of daring
are scarce and this splendid oppor-
tunity was allowed to slip.
