Currently the residence of Jim Barber and six undergradute women, PAX may
become Davidson’s fourth women’s eating house.

Fourth house may

By Becky LATANICH
Staff Writer

The fliers posted in Chambers
asked, “A little ticked off that males at
Davidson have six choices on Patterson
Court and females only have three?
Want a new eating house?”

This basic question arises every

_ year, but this year there is a newfound

urgency behind those words.

With a record number of women
self-selecting this year, overcrowding
has become a serious problem in
women’s eating houses. One potential
solution is the establishment of a fourth
eating house — a popular alternative
judging by the amount of interest dem-
onstrated at last Monday’s informa-
tional meeting in the 900 Room.

Jim Barber, Patterson Court Ad-
viser and Residence Life Coordinator,
began the meeting by outlining the lo-
-gistics of establishing a new eating
house. He explained that if at least 40
women will commit to being new house
members next fall, then RLO will foot
the bill for the structural renovation of
PAX.

However, because of the enormity
of this project, the new house most
likely would not have a functional
kitchen first semester. Consequently,
the new house would be forced to either
share a cook with another house on the
Court or have its food locally catered.

Aside from this, Barber stated that
the house would be fully functional in
time for the fall term.

Following Barber’s introduction,

i provide more choices

a panel comprised of the members of
the preliminary new eating house com-
mittee proceeded to explain why afourth
eating house was the most viable and
desirable solution to the problem of
overcrowding.

According to the four panelists
(Mary Shell Brosche, Claire Sisco, Hope
Henry, and Tory Talbot), all of whom
are presently members of an eating
house, a fourth eating house will not
only provide for increased women’s
involvement on Patterson Court, but it
will eradicate the overcrowding prob-
lem and in the process save the unique
self-selection system:

After their personal statements, the
floor was.opened up for the students to
voice their questions and concerns re-
garding this potential addition to
Patterson Court.

Some concern was expressed re-
garding the impact of a fourth eating
house on Connor, whose numbers have
recently been rather low. In response to
this concern, Claire Sisco said that “by
adding a fourth house, we can only
strengthen the position of the other
three.”

Tory Talbot, a Connor member
and panelist, added that she believes
that most of the potential members

~ would come from Rusk and Warner

Hall. As she pointed out, and others
attested to, the sheer size of these houses
can make them somewhat impersonal.
Thus, for those seeking a more personal
atmosphere, the new house might be a

Vamanos Van improves to appease criticisms

By Erin MCKINLEY
Op-Ed Editor

Davidsonians need not “run for
the border.” Instead they can call 564-
7135.and catch a ride on the Vamanos
Van.

Although some have questioned
the Van’s reliability, the recent addition
of acellular phone should “help the Van
run a lot more efficiently by improving
communication between drivers and
riders,” said Travis Barton, Co-chair of
the SGA Rides Committee.

Funding for the new cell phone
was secured last December, when
Barton and former Co-chair of the Rides
Committee Chris Tuttle went before
the Student Activities Council with their
request. The SAC agreed to purchase
the cell phone and pay its monthly bill
for the first year.

The new phone represents just one
way coordinators of the Vamanos Van
are “working to make this service more
convenient,” said Tuttle. Plans for a
Frequent Rider Card are also being con-

sidered. If the’idea develops, students
would have the option of buying a card
for a flat price, which would allow
unlimited usage overa given time frame.
Barton added, “A card would be a lot

more handy because then (riders) ©

wouldn’t have to carry money around.”

Currently, passengers pay a dol-
lar-each-way fee.
“attempts to at least help cover some
costs.” Expenditures, largely paid for
through the SGA budget, include gas
and a $39-per-night van rental fee. Al-
though revenue from passenger fees
isn’t expected to meet expenses any
time soon, Tuttle and Barton have seen
“ridership go up” since the beginning of
the new semester.

While last semester an average of
$15-20 per weekend in passenger fees
was collected, an unprecedented sum of
$60 was brought in the first weekend
back from Christmas break, and Tuttle
expects that “things will continue to
grow.”

Tuttle attributes this increase in
ridership to the convenience of the new

This, said Tuttle, -

cell phone, an increase in advertising,
and the return of juniors from abroad.
In terms of promotion, fliers were “put
under every door” as well as posted all
around campus. Ads also have been
placed in The Davidsonian, publicizing
pick-up locations, operating hours, and
driving boundaries.

According to the numerous fliers,
this one-dollar fare will take students
“anywhere (they) want to go” between
the Moorseville exit to the north and the
Huntersville exit to the south. The Van,
available from 7 p.m. until | a.m. every
Thursday through Saturday, stops in
front of Rich on the hour before swing-
ing by the Martin Court Kiosk to pick
up students at ten after the hour. And
now with the cell phone, students can
call the driver to find out other times the
Van will be on campus for pick-ups as
well as informing the driver when they
are ready to be taken back.

“Everyone should ride. it,” said
freshman Andy Rhodes, who has used
the service to go out to dinner with
friends. Rhodes went on to say that “the

drivers are always really cool.”

So who are these drivers? Stu-
dents volunteer to get behind the wheel
of the Vamanos Van, but before they
can actually drive, they must complete
a training course that includes watching
a video about driving large motor ve-
hicles, completing a written exam, and
passing a driving test. Police officer
Ray Legory offers his time to teach the
course and thereby train the volunteers.

Once certified, students sign up
for atime slot. Each operating night is
divided into two three-hour shifts, and
generally “each volunteer only has to
work two shifts throughout the whole
semester.”

According to Barton, Van drivers
“do it out of the goodness of their heart.”
One driver in particular, Lindsay Vagt,
has “worked really hard,” said Tuttle.
Now that Tuttle has been elected Vice

‘President of SGA, Vagt will be filling

Tuttle’s shoes.

Drivers and coordinators alike of-
fer their time not only as a safety alter-
native to drunk driving, but simply be-

“I thought the Code of Responsibility would handle it. To say that I banged my head on the wall is ludicrous.”

cause they believe, a$ Barton said, “Itis
important to students who don’t have a
car.” Freshman Vamanos Van _ rider
Scott Geiger recognizes this understand-
ing. ‘(The Vamanos Van) represents
the SGA’s willingness to comply with
student needs.”

Although, Barton admitted, “we
are still working out the kinks,” she
claimed that Van is “in everyone’s best
interest.” Having already witnessed the
transportation program’s successes and
recognizing further potential for growth,
Barton said, “I would like to see the
whole Davidson campus really get be-
hind the Van.”
