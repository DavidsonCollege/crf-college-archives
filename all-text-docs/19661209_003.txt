Puffing regulatly on a ciga-
rette nt the evening session,
Whitchend explained his work
simply and clearly, making va-
rious comments on the writing
of his poetry.

The name Domains ia taken
[rom the Final puem of his buok.
He said that his poetry is writ:
ter in simple verse and is
limited in scope. ’

The subject matter of the
book Js of tensions between da-

ilttes with skin on il" and draws
both geod and bad conclusions
about Ife. The second domain
is love, or more specifically
“what goes on betiveen men ald
women,”

The title poem, “Domina”, is
free. in form, It tells of '*: poll-
tics and the rugged brotherhood
of man.”

Among the line of love poetry
ls “For the Lady at Her Mir-
ror’, which tells about a hus-
band who observes his wife's
distaste of sering herself grow

fs a poem of celebration that
tells of nis observing a woman's
buttocks while he was taking a
walk.

From his “regional or politi
cal poems” comes ‘'One for
The Road.’ This dramatic poem
felis of ‘“‘a truckdriver’s cele-
bration of his lady.” and so it
is alvo ‘‘a bit of 4 love poem al-
so. “Swimming” is a story of
middle class boys swimming In
a river when confronted with
“yeomen folk, rednecks,”

a politician's promise to pro-
vide alr conditioning units to

Both Karly and Regular De

White said that the reason for
this decline is “the drop {n the
number of college applicants
and the increase in openings in
new and enlarging institutions.”

White also stated that ‘com.

Davidson applicants in the past.
The goncral impression that we
get trom guidance counselors is
that, uniess a student is very,

virad not to apply to Davidson.

“To correct this decline in
applications,"’ White continued,
“we will hold four meetings on

Wednesdays and Fridays for the
next two weeks to get studonts

who are willing to talk to guld-
