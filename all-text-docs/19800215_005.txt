The Wildcats put together a
fine performance Wednesday
but clutch play in the closing
moments propelled Wake For-
est to a 61-53 victory. The score
was not indicative of the game’s
nature as Davidson was forced
to foul in the waning seconds.

Tough breaks down the
stretch, including a question-
able offensive foul whistled on
DiBenedetto with the score tied
at 51, proved fatal to the Cat
cause. Several Deacon misses
from the charity stripe were
rebounded by Wake Forest
players in the last minute and
driving dunks by Jim John-
stone and Alvis Rogers sealed
the verdict.

Todd Haynes paced the Wild-
cats with 18 points while Richie
D. powered home 13. Freshmen
Cliff Tribus drilled five of six
from the floor for 10 points.
Alvis Rogers led the Demon
Deacs with 22.

Davidson turned the tables
on their seasonal pattern a-
gainst South Carolina in the
Coliseum Saturday night. In-
stead of folding down the

stretch and conceding defeat,
and forced South Carolina to
overtime before succumbing 78-
77. Despite the loss, Wildcat
performance was most encour-
aging.

South Carolina built a nine
point halftime cushion on the
strength of its post players,
6’11” Jim Strickland and 6’8”
Cedrick Hodges, who combined
for 47 points on the evening.
The Cats, however, clawed back
in the second half with excellent
shooting (32 of 58 for the game)
and pressure defense. Todd
Haynes finally knotted the
score at 69 with 4:28 left in
regulation. With matters tied at
71, Davidson had an opportuni-
ty to win, but Rich DiBenedet-
to’s follow shot of an errant

Haynes jumper missed and time
expired.

The Cats jumped to a 75-71
lead in overtime but a Strick-
land dunk followed by a Hor-
dges bucket brought the Game-

cocks back. Davidson led again -

77-76 before Zam Frederick
canned one from the right
baseline with 24 seconds left.
Subsequent misses by. DiBene-~

dette and John Carroll pre-
served the Gamecock 7,

the Cats with 19 — rvhile
Haynes added 14. Freshman
Cliff Tribus also tall neers an
assortment of j
wing area and Peer sad aie
Rowan connected on 5 of 6 field
goal attempts and collected two
from the line for 12 points.

All in all, it was a solid
performance for the Cats, whose
overtime record on the year is
0-3. Coach Biedenbach com-
mented, ‘‘You can never be
satisfied with a loss, but there
wasn’t a lack of effort Saturday
night. Turnoverwise, it was our
best game of the year and
offensively we shot well and
exhibited good patience. Things
just didn’t go our way at the
end.”

Next Saturday the Cats tra-
vel to Boone for an all-impor-
tant Southern Conference con-

a. position in the upcoming
would relegate the Cats to the
ee
play.

Rich Perkey and Tim Bowker see future for Davidson basketball:

By BERT MOBLEY

Two of Davidson's three bas-
ketball seniors have not had
such an easy time of things over
their four years as Wildcats.

Besides their unimpressive sea-
sons, Rich Perkey and Tim

’ Bowker have had other areas of
their college life where changes
might ‘have been welcome.

Perkey sat on the bench for
his first. two years ‘‘playing”
without a scholarship. “I have

always enjoyed playing,’’ he
said, “and I thought I could
make the team. But after two
years, I had gotten to the point
where I didn’t know if I could
play or not. I had to find out
about myself.”

He got his chance in the first

game of his junior year; this -

was also the first game for new
head coach Eddie Biedenbach.

Perkey said he played.more in .

that game than he had ‘‘collec-
tively in the two years before.”
That was a good moment for

him and the point. guard. from
ie Va., earned a scho-

Bowker had a tough time,

also. “I don’t know that I have

a nm of regrets basketball-wise

except for not being able to play

more.” The ‘otherwise”’ is what
gave Bowker trouble.

“T was kind of blind to a lot of
things I would have to do
academically,”’ he said. ‘‘I had
to get things in perspective and
learn how to budget my time

wisely. Academics should come
first over basketball— acade-
mics is what is important.”

“It took me a while to get
used to the school, too,” he
said. ‘‘Davidson has such a
large majority of different kinds
of people; there’s such a dif-
ferent atmosphere from what I
was used to. If I could go back,
I'd try to be better prepared and
wouldn’t have looked strictly in
terms of basketball.”

Bowker was recruited by
Dave Pritchett and then played
his sophomore year under John
Kochan before Biedenbach
came last year. ‘I had to learn a
lot about adjusting with all the
coaching changes, but the ex-
perience will help me later.
Everybody has to learn how to
accept changes.”’

Both players will quickly
acknowledge the great amount

.of time required by basketball.
“The bad thing about playing
basketball,”” Perkey said, ‘“‘is
there’s not a lot of time for other
things. I'd love to do an
internship or go JYA: of some-
thing, but. with basketball,
there’s just not time for many

well as. physical time according
to’ Bowker. ‘It’s -hard to go

right from practice to studying

eventually go back to school,
like business school, but I've

’ had quite a. bit of it for now.”

They see a future for David-
son basketball, too. ‘‘Given
time, Coach Biedenbach will do
well here,” Bowker said. “The
program has a stabilizing factor
now, and they just have to keep
learning new things. You have
to let the system develop; the
upperclassmen need to have
confidence and a good attitude.
They need to know what’s
expected of them.”

Perkey concurred by saying,
“A basketball program is just
that—an established way of
doing things. Stability is the
key. Biedenbach has the ability .
to turn things around. It’s
getting to be his program
now—his players and not
Pritchett’s or Kochan’s—and
things will change.” A problem
of the past according to Perkey
has been too much satisfaction

. with ‘“‘close losses and good

“But the school needs to
change: its goals,”’ Perkey
added, ‘‘from gaining national.
prominence to winning the Sou-

_ thern Conference championship

and getting into the NCAA
tournament. There are are more
and more good teams in college.
