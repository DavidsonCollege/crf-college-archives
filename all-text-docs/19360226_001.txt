On Monday evening at 7:30
Reverend Herbert Johnson, of
Winston - Salem’s Moravian
Church, spoke to students and
faculty in the auditorium on
the subject-of tlie Scandinavian
countries, Denmark, Norway,
and Sweden. ‘
~ Dr. T. W. Lingie, in introducing
Dr. Johnson, mentioned that-he-was
of Norwegian parentage and not
Swedish, as was stated in The Dav-
last week. He told how
the minister had been educated at
the Moravian College in Bethlehem,

country in his youth, had filled pas-
