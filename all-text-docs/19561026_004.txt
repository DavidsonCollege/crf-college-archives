Davidson Filming Begins

Filming of the motion picture ‘The Davidson Story’’ be-
gan Thursday afternoon, at four o'clock.

film announced plans to do ex-
tensive filming during the Home.

nasium. Saturday afternoon sev-
eral shots will be made at.the foot-
ball game.

The script, which has just been
completed, calls for three main
characters and a girl. With the
exception of the lead, which wil!
be played by a professional actor,
all other roles will feature stu-
dents of the college.

Bill Lipton, a professional actor,
announcer and narrator from
Greenwich, Conn., has been desig-
nated to play the lead role in
which he will protray a Davidson
pre-med student. Lipton has been
seen in the Broadway productions
of “Life With Father” and “The
Family.” He has had television
experience with the program

ay

STARRING IN THE LEAD

“Robert Montgomery Presents.”

STUDENTS TAKE’ PARTS

Student parts will be played by
Reitzel Snider and Dan LaFar.
These two were selected after much
observation of the entire student
body. Gunn stated that each
of these selections was made after
a great déal of consideration and
narrowing down of those students
fitting characteristics set in the
script.

Much of the filming will take
place on the weekends when Lip.
ton is to be’ on campus. Snider
will represent the out-going, ath-
letic student who is active in the
R.O.T.C. department. LaFar,
contrast, illustrates the more con-
servative student interested in
campus political affairs and a mem-
ber of the Male Chorus.

COOPERATION NEEDED

The picture shows the story of
the Davidson students, therefore
many of the scenes will include
general shots of the students. Gunn
emphasized the need of student
cooperation, which he said is im-
perative if the success of this

‘|project is to be assured.

The Davidson student has been
variously described, Gunn has
said, as “sports-minded, and not
top heavy in relation to his acade-
mie pursuits.” The qualities he is
said to admire most include phy-
sical vigor, honesty, sincerity,
academic excellence and a sense

‘lof humor. These are the qualities

which Gunn and his staff of script
writers, photographers, and tech-
nicians are hoping to capture in
this film.

Last night, scenes of the College

Davidson College ranks with the top eight colleges and
universities in the United States in the number of. graduates
who have won fellowships from the Danforth Foundation.

An announcement received from
the Foundation by the eollege
states that only seven other insti-
tutions have graduated as many
Danforth Fellows as the six David-
son alumni who have been named.

Six FROM DC

The seven are Denison University
in Ohio, Duke, Harvard, Pomona,
Williams, Wooster and Yale. Po-
mona and Duke have seven, the
others six.

Danforth Graduate Fellowships
were established in 1951 “to bring
into higher education a_ larger
number of young men, thoroughly
trained according to highest scho-
lastic standards, who are aware of
the place for moral and religious
values in teaching and counseling.”

The appointments carry the
promise of fellowship in an annual
conference on college teaching, the
assurance of financial support as
needed during the years of grad-
uate study, and every possible en-

BECOME TEACHERS

Since the program began, 302
Fellows have been appointed. Its
basic purpose is to encourage ex-
ceptional students to become col-
lege teachers, and appointments
are made by a board of seven lead-
ing educators.

The Foundation has invited Da-
vidson students to apply once
again for the awards, which are
limited to 60 per year. Fifty-seven
were chosen last April. and two
were Davidson seniors, Joc] Conar-
roe of Bradenton. Fla, and Wil-
Ham H. F. Kuykendall of Char-
lotte.

New Drinking Pledge
(Continued from Page One)

liberal arts colleges and universi-
ties in the nation only two have
ancient language as a required
course for the A.B. degree. He also
noted that there were only 22 B.A.
degrees awarded at last spring's
graduation, as compared with over
150 B.S. degrees given at that time.

Kukura urged thé Council mem-
bers to generate student interest
on this subject in order for it to

spect the Davidson College ROTC] Pass through the faculty committee

Unit next Tuesday.

Col. Keithly, who took over his
current command on August 13,
will observe the physical facilities
of the local unit and also the
progress in organizing the 1956-
57 cadet regiment.

On the drill field he will per-
sonally inspect both the Honor
Platoon and the Band. After drill
the cadet regimental staff will
give him a complete briefing on
the functioning of the corps.

R.0.T.C.

Col. Keithly was commissioned
a second lieutenant in the field
artillery reserve after graduating
from the Reserve Officers Train-
ing Corps in 1927. The following

so it could be brought up at the
February meeting of the Board of
Trustees. Kukura said it was “ab-
surd” to have a B.S. degree in Eng-
lish and advocated that the lan-
guage requirement for the Arts de-
gree be lifted so that more B.A.
degrees would be awarded.

Th matter being discussed -fur-
ther, Tom Johnson moved that the
Council recommend to the faculty
a proposal of Kukura’s that the
.Arts degree be given to any grad-
uate not majoring in science, math,
or business administration. The
motion passed.

much-diseussed telephone project
of the Council. He stated that H. C.
Broyles, whose local printing firm
publishes The Davidsonian, wants
to hire a lawyer to investigate the
proposal of the Charlotte telephone
company to the Council. Broyles
also wants to put Davidson on the
Charlotte exchange.

The President said the Council
should participate in this project.
A motion to this effect by Vernon
Hunter, senior Council member,
was passed. The motion stated that
the Council should back Broyles’
move to hire a lawyer with moral
support and monetary assistance
to the tune of $15.

DISCUSS RIOTS

The last item of business on the
Council’s agenda concerned riots.
President LaFar hoped that the
Council would enforce the stopping
of firecracker shooting and the
prevention of damage done to dor-
mitory property at riots. He urged
the Council members to make a
concerted effort in this direction.

College Library Gets
NBC Wilson Tape

The College Library has acquired
a tape recording of the National
Broadcasting Company's fifty-
minute nation wide program on
Woodrow Wilson.

The recording was sent to Dr.
Cunningham in appreciation of his
recording, at NBC’s request, a
number of incidents concerning
Woodrow Wilson at Davidson. Dr.
Cunningham has turned the tape
over to Dr. Davidson to be includ-
ed in the Library’s Woodrow Wil-
son collection.

Taking note of Wilson’s rela-
tionship here. two incidents at
Davidson are included. One con-
cerns his academic record here,
and the other is a story told’ by
the late Dr. Lingle in which Wil-
son won a baseball game when
Governor Robert. Glenn was pilch-

-fing.

"War and Peace’

Approximately 20 students and
faculty attended the discussion of
the ‘movie and the book, Wer and
Peace. Dr. and Mrs. Cumming led
the. discussion, which included
good student: participation as well
as the Cummings’ professional
criticisms.

This was the first in a series
of informal coffee-hour discussions
of a literary nature to be
sponsored by the Bookshelf Com-
mittee of the College Union.

This group plans to hold discus-
sions recognizing Davidson faculty
members who have had books pub-
lished, as well as discussions of
other movie and book combina-
tions, such as Moby Dick and Don
Quixote.

Dr. Julian Lake fo
Speak at Vespers

Dr. Julian Lake, minister of the
First Presbyterian Church of Win-
ston-Salem, N. C., will be the Ves-
pers speaker this Sunday.

ological Seminary in Richmond.
He was for seveh years minister
of the Oakland Avenue Presbyte-
rian Church in Rock Hill, S. C.,
and during that time was minister
to Presbyterian girls at Winthrop
College.

The service will be an obser-
vance of Reformation Day, since
this falls nearest to that day in
1517 when Martin Luther posted
his 95 theses. Some of the music
used in the service will be com-
posed by Mr. Gehring especially
for the occasion.

you still keeping in shape?”

Gunn's radio career led him suc-
cessively from Gainesville to
Charleston, then to Washington and
on to New York.

Gunn's work in New York has
brought him in contact with many
of the big names in the entertain:
ment world including Kay Armand,
Felix Knight, and June Vallee.
Gunn likes to tell of his brief en-
counter with Walter Winchell.

It seems that he ran into Win-
chell in the broadcasting building
and they both had on identical
hats. Gunn’s hat was too big for
Winchell, and Winchell’s hat stood
like a can on Gunn's head. As they
returned their hats to each other,
Winchell asked Gunn where he got
his big head. Gunn replied that it
came from his father. Then Gunn
asked Winchell where he got HIS
big head. Winchell turned abruptly
and stomped back into his office.

Gunn, in response to questions,
answered in swift succession that
he “likes Ike” very much, doesn't
agree with Billy Graham's evange-
listic technique but ‘realizes that
Graham is doing an effective work,
and thinks that New York's great-
est preachers are Fosdick, Mc-
Cracken, Bonnell, and Dean Pike,
in that order.

When asked to give a comment
on the thing about Davidson that
impressed him most, he answered
by quoting a sentence from his
script of the “Davidson Story”:
“We learned that the term extra-
curricular referred not only to the
act of playing together, but also to
the art of learning to work to-
gether.”
