THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 12, 1922

2. ;
WEEKLY LETTER
Davidson, N.C.
October 9, 1922.
Dear Joe:

The Golden Tornado is once more
just plain Yellow Jackets to us Wild-
cats. Instead of sweeping over us 70
to 0 or 66 to 0 which as you will prob-
ably remember has been the scores in
the two seasons previous to the present,
they were only able to sting us to the
tune of three touchdowns.

The Davidson team has also turned
into Wildcats once again and instead
of being whipped before they saw the
smoky city as in the two aforesaid
years, they was busy sharpening their
claws on the journey southward and
while unable to inflict any serious dam-
age on the opposition they were all
there when it came to the fight and pep.
In fact, Joe, during the last two chuk-
kers the Techmen were held scoreless
which is the first time the Wildcats
‘have accomplished this feat of a score-
Jess half since before this big war
across the pond started, of which we
have all been hearing so much about.
Fight? why that’s what our team ain’t
got nuthin’ else but of !

You know, Joe, that I was betting
on a margin of 28 points but the team
goes me one better and holds Tech to
19 points which is even closer than in
the ’17 game when Flowers, Grey,
King & Co. held the Tornado to a 22-
point margin, but as you will see up
above this don’t quite come up to that
as the Tornado has changed back to
Yellow Jackets. The Jackets are also
somewhat smaller than they were five
years ago.

But Joe, don’t let these wise guys
kid you into believing that Red Barron

is tottering on the brink of the grave.
He looked like about one-half of the
Jacket backfield during the first half
and_16 and 18-yard runs are entirely
too long for any one quite so old and
decrepit. Of course the Wildcats
showed * him all the courtesy and
veneration due to any one of-his age
and from the yards ticked off it seems
like he took advantage of all that was
given and a good deal more added on.

Pup McWhorter, Red Murphy, etc.,
was pretty good, too, but when it come
to hitting a stone wall, there wasn’t
anything for them to do but hand the
old pigskin over and say, “Here Wild-
cats, we can’t gain nothing, see if
you're any good at the game.”

But Joseph, when the Red and Black
scrappers lost the ball on downs on
their 27-yard line it looked like ‘“‘Good-
night Wildcats.” But after Harris and
McWhorter failed to gain and that
“thin Red line” threw McWhorter for
a three-yard loss, a scoreless half was
sure as the field was too muddy to drop
kick accurately.

Speaking of mud, Joe, if mud was
water, then Grant Field was the Pacific
ocean last Saturday. Pup McWhorter
and Red Murphy both failed on drop
kicks during the last period and at one
time the ball was on the Wildcats two-
yard line before we came through it all.

Joe, I guess you've heard the song
entitled “I’m a Rambling Wreck From
Georgia Tech.” Well, in this game
which we are mentioning casually, sev-
eral Tech men had the feeling that they
were wrecks, In fact, Joe, they took
four times as much time out as the
above mentioned Presbyterians. Pres-
byterians may be blue but during the
contest they smeared a little blue over
the Jackets in the form of bruises. —I
imagine them birds didn’t feel any too
good whether it was 130-pound Spratt
or 193-pound Sam Summers which did
the dirty work. The Wildcats always
hit ’em pretty low and very hard. Sam
also did some snappy work when on
the one-yard line. He stopped two
plays which McDonough and Red Bar-
ron figured were supposed to go right
over him and the two gentlemen just
named were forced to lay thé ball
down in the precise location in which
it was resting the play before. As I
was starting to mention, however, the
Techmen had the delightful experience
of having their breath knocked out of
them on several entirely separate

= | occasions.

Well, Josephus, Cap’n Spratt and
this 190-pound Lyman that plays at
tackle for Tech used to play together
out in_li” ole Chattanooga on the
McCallie team and Saturday they was
trying to see which one could get in
the other’s way the most often’ while
Pup McWhorter and Red Murphy,
which used to indulge in a scrap every
chance they could get, out in the same
old burg, was working together like
brothers. Such is life!

You must of noticed also that in the
second period it took the Jackets six
‘downs to make seven yards to the last
chalk line and, three of thesé downs
was employed in carrying.it past the
jone-yard post. That’s the kind of a

ldown to nobody.

Well, Joe, .after the first three games
last season we was 91 points behind
our opponents in the matter of rolling
up the score whilst this fall after the
opening trio we are four points ahead
of our opponents. Quite a difference
over last year, eh what!

Well seeing that we've passed
through this contest with colors flying,
the next thing to look forward to is the
Wake Forest fracas Saturday. I’ll tell
the world that Charlotte gave us a
good time down there on Davidson
Day last week, The banquet was O.
K. Joe, and talk about generosity—
some of the fellows are still smoking
cigarettes which were passed out to
them in that Made-in-Carolinas affair.
they was having down there. Of
course every one went when a free pass
there and back was handed out, but if
you make it to the Queen City next
Saturday you'll see just as big a bunch
down there. Of course we ain’t
promising anything but I wouldn’t be
a-tall surprised if you didn’t see a
much more interesting parade that
night than the one which was held on
the morning of Davidson Day.

You know Joe, whether nobobdy
else goes or not we'll show ’em a team
that anybody’ll have a hard time beat-
ing. Since Fetzer’s team, which held
Yale to the same count as we did Tech,
whipped the Baptists, 62 to 3, we’ve
been feeling pretty cocky, but two
weeks ago and Saturday is two dif-
ferent matters and the Wake Forest
team is probably woke up considerable.
Our battle slogan is ‘Remember Octo-
ber, 15, 1921.” Of course, Joe, if you
remember that date, and you ought to,
you won't say a word. Just be on
hand at Wearn Field to see how many
points those four words will cost Wake
Forest!

While we were scrapping with the
Jackets, Heckman’s team with Heck-
man out was trampling gently on Elon
to the tune of 7-0. Well, Heckman
will probably be in Saturday, on the
job to try and make it two straight!
Well, Joe, you just know we'll be there
500 strong to sort of assist the team in
wrecking Heckman’s pet ambition.

If you could have seen when the
team left for Tech and when they come
back, not to mention when the plays
was coming in, you wouldn’t need to
ask whether there is such a thing as
the Wildcat spirit, Joe, but being: as
you've got some common sense, I don’t
think you'd ask a question like that to
any one of us anyhow. ‘As I have
aforesaid, Joe, we ain’t prophesying a
thing but if things pan out right we are
hoping for a chance to paint Charlotte
Red and Black sometime during the
coming week-end.

Well, Joe, come down and help us
and the alumni support our scrappers
Saturday. The more the merrier!
Everybody is figuring on, going down
and showing the team, C Charlotte and,
last but not least, Wake Forest, that

we mean business. Go get ’em Wild-
cats! As ever,

the fourth down was incomplete and
the ball went over to Tech on David-
son’s 27-yard line. Mallory stopped
Harris on a trip around end and Mc-
Whorter was held for no gain over
right tackle. Then on the third down
the Wildcats broke through and nailed
McWhorter for a three-yard loss.
When Murphy failed on a drop kick,
Tech’s chance to score during the half
was gone as Martin punted 38 yards
out of danger. In addition to the
stellar line work, one Tech pass was
intercepted and a Tech fumble recov-
ered. Brice played a great game at
center and Faison and Davis kept the
ends well guarded. Gig Shepherd,

who did some fire punting and pulled

down a Tech pass, was forced from
the game during the first of the second
period by an injured foot. Faison also
hurt his leg but no other casualties are
reported.

With Our Opponents

The Carolina-Davidson game bids
fair to be a Battle of the Giants this
year. Both teams are rounding into
form and if scores are any measure of
ability both are stronger than last year,
for in 1921 Yale beat Carolina, 34-0,
and this year but 18-0; while in the
same year the Wildcats brought Ga.
Tech’s margin of victory from 70 to
19.

What is more, 18 points doesn’t
spell the true difference between Yale
and Carolina. A punt that hit the goal
post gave Yale six while McDonald
scored on Yale only to have it an-
nulled for an offside play. Twelve to
six would be a better comparison of the
strength of the two teams.

The Wake Forest crew looks like a
one-man machine. They can’t win
without Heckman and perhaps that is
why Elon held the Baptists to seven
points. At any rate Heckman will be
back in shape Saturday. Wake Forest
beat us last year so it ought to be a
good game but—revenge is sweet and
three or four touchdowns won’t be
teo_many.

V. P. I, our next big opponent, is
rolling right along. William: and
Mary, their latest victim, fell before
the Engineers, 20-6. Penn State de-
feated William and Mary only 27-6
last week. V. P. I. beat their smaller
opponents, 14-0 last year, the same
margin of difference both years. Next
week Virginia Tech will be put to the
acid test when they meet Centre in
Richmond. Judging from the records
of the two teams it doesn’ .t look exactly
like all Centre.

There is no doubt about it, Trinity is
coming right along. In fact they ap-
pear to-be about as good as V. P. I.
The Methodists got a 28-0 decision
over Hampden-Sidney, while the Va.
Tech eleven turned ’em in at 38-0.
Trinity and Carolina meet Thursday
in a game that will go a long ways to-
wards showing just what Trinity will

be able to strut on the field at Greens-
boro.

The Wolfpack of N. C. State went
up to Virginia looking for prey, but
they were unsuccessful in their quest.
Washington and Lee won from the
Farmers, 16-6, though State had a lead
of six points at the end of the first
period. State and Washington and
Lee did not play last year.

EAS Her new combination came off
down in Gainesville where the Florida
and Furman elevens met in gladitorial

‘conflict. The ’Gators were pretty firm

on their feet, but the Purple Hurricane
lifted them aside long enough. to score
a touchdown and put over the point
that was the margin of a 7-6 victory.
The ’Gator team has always been
noted for weight, so probably the Fur-
man eleven fought against odds. If so
it was a better showing than they made
against Newberry ax Saturday.
