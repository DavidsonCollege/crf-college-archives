BLINDED BY SNOW

It always snows at Midwinters.

And it is a hard thing to feel like writing sports
after looking into the flood of pseudo-cool lines that
clash with hungry, warm hearts to make midwinter
snow.

The sweet wine taste of victory over NYU and
a near upset of St. Joseph's is good—-and could
evoke praise without a softening of my sordid
cynicism.

But for many the sweet wine has turned bitter,
and the deep red of perfection has been watered
to a rot-gut brown by a so-called ticket policy de-
signed to soak this passive student body for all they
can be drenched.

There are conventional sports to write of; there
are crusades whose cross demands a carrier and
there are the successful whose showing hollars for
much warranted praise.

But | am blinded by too much midwinter snow,
and its coldness covers me too deeply to allow at-
tention for ticket moneymongers or basketball
games. Instead | look through the eyes of a date
at the sport we play best this time of year . . .

THE MIDWINTERS GAME

It was so thrilling, such a heavenly honor to be
asked. I tell you if Barbara’s boyfriend’s fraternity
brother hadn’t needed a date Thursday night, I just
might never have met him. Now my whole life’s
changed—his too, of course.

I got there with Barbara early Friday afternoon.
Well I don’t mind telling you I was a little scared at
first. When I walked in I heard this terrible crash
and a thump, and some boy ran off the back porch
‘saying some. awful things. That really scared me.

I think he was a pledge, they make them do bad
things, you know. ;

Well, we didn’t meet until right before supper.
I'll tell you, when I first saw him I wasn't too im-
pressed. He said he’d gotten the cut and bruise on
his head playing football—he’s out for winter prac-
tice; he’s number one on the team—and he had a
huge bandage covering the place where he'd been
hurt.

But it sure didn’t take me long to learn that
first impressions can really fool you. We ate a per-
fectly gorgeous meal. 1 had turkey, ham, shrimp
creole, a double helping of mashed potatoes, peas
and carrots, rolls, tons of butter, ice cream (two
cups) and just all kinds of other food. He didn't
eat much. Football practice makes you lose your
appetite, you know.

Well, | could just go on and on. We saw Ram-
sey Lewis (he’s real famous, I'd never heard of him
before the weekend) that night. I'll tell you, we
could just have listened to him forever and ever.
I just love Ramsey. RL (that’s Ramsey Lewis, in case
you didn’t know) is fabulous, really too fabulous for
words.
But most fun of all was the party. Of course I
don’t drink and neither does he, still a lot of boys did
——and some of the other girls. We had just a won-
derful, exquisite time—for almost an hour. I twist-
ed the first dance with him and then some boy cut
in on us. And do you know I danced with every
pledge the next 45 minutes? _

Then we had to go; football practice on Satur-
day, you know. Nobody else was in the dormitory—
but I guess coming in early is the price you pay for
being the number one football player’s best girl.

i wouldn't trade all my life for Saturday of
Davidson’s Midwinters. It was a vision come true,
just like in the movies. It was too angelic for words.

Of course I didn’t see him until about supper-
time with football practice and all. Everybody just
sleeps through lunch there. . ;

Well, we went outside of Davidson to eat supper,
and it was too quaint for words. He called it Hattie’s,
and we ate supper there at 4:30 that afternoon—to
beat the crowd, wasn’t he clever to think of that?

1 had three cheesburgers, two packs of potato
chips, a bag of pop corn, four boiled eggs, a bologna
and a cheese sandwich, two burgers, a hot dog, some
other stuff and .. . one beer! I really did it! I wouldn’t
have except he ordered Hieerstiod§ all he had for
supper. Besides, everybody drinks beer. ;
PPY guess I shouldn’t say it, but I got drunk. Right
there; thank my lucky stars—and I do—no one was
around but he took me back to the soccer field near
the college to make sure no one would see me. He
was so nice. .

Well being drunk, I started talking a lot and I
told him how I thought I was a little overweight and
that some people felt. like I was simple. ,

“1 don’t know what makes you think you're over-
weight,” he assured me. “But I know, just from being
around you two days, there’s a lot to you!

Weil, I could have burst. I was so proud and
happy. I lost control then. I threw my arms around
him and started to kiss him square in the mouth. I
just had to thank him in my own little way.

Then be belehed. I think it was the beer he had.
Anyway we drove back to the fraternity.

He was scared. he would be too sick to go out
that night, but all his fraternity brothers and some of
their dates helped me convince him he’d feel better
at the party. So he said OK.

That night was celestial, | mean pure seventh
heaven. Lloyd Price, who’s been my very favorite,
number one singer for at least eight years, was there.
He sang them all, “Stagger Lee,” “Personality, and
my personal favorite—and so appropriate — “I'm
Gonna Get Married.” They were just fabuiously won-
derful-swell. Everybody loved them. ; ;

He got sicker at Lioyd Price. But I told him he d

1 better at the party.
fee Bid witet a aprtyl We just had more fun than I
can sav. Everybody was so nice. All the pledges twist-
ed with me again. All the brothers talked to me;
they’d.all heard a lot about me. That’s why I know
he had so much fun. He told all them about me.

Well, we both drank some. I probably had too
much, because the next thing I knew we were in the
b at of some car. ,

ack fer a while I looked him in the face and
said, “You think less of me for being drunk and all.

He looked at me and smiled, “I couldn't

you'r ever sa him Sunday—football practice—but

PUTS TEAM FIRST

Snyder Is More Than

By TOMMY COX
Davidsonian Sports Writer
Dick Snyder scored 22 points
in a hotly contested game and

ment authoritatively over their
10 o'clock coffee and doughtnuts
that the total was eight points
below the superhorse’s average.
A bad night for Snyder and the
Wildcats, who lost by four.
This is the fate of peing a sup
erstar, like Dick. Snyder, a candi
date for All-America. The people
who watched melodrama on the
other channel Tuesday night and
the other “experts” across the
nafion know only the final score.
These box-score pagans of
Wednesday morning know of the
heraldings of rival coaches, the

praise of sportswriters, and the
30 point average. They ‘form
opinions as to the magnitude of
Dick Snyder's performance
around gossiping secretaries and.
the typewriter of the copy desk.
Twenty two points he scored,
yet how many assists did he
have, how many. times did he
score over three men. and how
much morale does he give to
Lefiy Driesell's Wildcats?
Snyder. drives the foul lane ,
and pulls two defenders off their.
men. A quick pass under the

easy Jay-up. That makes 24
points, then 26 points, then 28

"Cats To Invade

Citadel

Domain

The Davidson Wildcats travel to The Citadel tomor-
row night for their last game of the regular season. The
‘Cats defeated The Citadel in their first meeting of the
season, 81 77, at Johnston Gym. However, the Bulldogs
have improved in the last few games, defeating Rich
mond and Furman in road games.

Said Coach Lefty Driesell.
“We realize it will be a tough
ball game and would like to end
the season with a win. We still
have hopes of winning 20 games
this season.”

The Southern Conference Tour-
nament starts Thursday with
eight teams in the running for
the conference crown. The only
first round game that has been
decided is the East Carolina
Richmond game. The other three
games in the first round will be
decided this weekend.

George Washington is the only

team definitely out of the turna-
ment because of the season re-
cord. Davidson, William and
Mary, and West Virginia are the
three top teams in the tourney.
The winner of the Conference
title will play the Yankee Con-
ference Champion.

“This is what we've been
pointing for all year and. the
boys want to win it very badly.
I think we are fully capable of

winning if the boys will produce ,

in those three games.” said
Driesell.

Grapplers Bow
To Tech, ECC

Today the Davidson varsity
wrestling team took on the North
Carolina State Wolfpack in John-
ston Gym at 12:30. The Wildcats
were seeking to get back in the
win column after defeats at the
hands of Georgia Tech and East
Carolina.

At. Greenville Monday the
team lost to the Pirates, 23-8.
Lowell Bryan pinned his oppon-
ent to run his record further as
he remains unbeaten, all of his
wins being on pins. Eric-Nichols,
the team captain. took a decision
to round out the Davidson scor-
ing.

The brightest spot of the day
came as the Pirates sent a 6-3,
215-pound heavyweight against

Davidson freshman Kerry Keith.
The difference in size was so ap
parent that the crowd began to
laugh.

The giant's record previously
had been perfect with all pins.
Keith proceeded to win the
match by a 10-2 margin, taking
the opponent down twice with
the same move and, as Coach
Dave Fagg said, ‘'. . . just mop
ped the guy up.”

Saturday the Wildcats hosted
Georgia Tech in a home meet.
Tech won, 22-11.

The Davidson scoring was ac-
cumulated by Joe Buffington.
Erie Nichols, and Lowell Bryan.

Bryan registered tlic only pin.

A Star

One writes a line about the
merits of Dick Snyder and at
once it is repetitious. Snyder is
today better than he was al the
beginning of the season when
Lefty Driesell called him the

“greatest player in the country.”

‘Of course, that. feeling was
Driesell's. but Snyder has since
given others. the same impres-

der receives from his basketball

The Wildcat swimmers splash-

pool with ECC, turning in a cre-
ditable performance despite los-
ing by 6642. Monday night.

The meet. was. fairly even
through the first few. events.
‘Tom Irons placed second in the
200'yard freestyle and. Bris Red-
gers captured first in the 50-
yard freestyle. However, the nar-
row gap was split wide open
when ECC registered 16 out of
the next 18 possible points in the
individual medley and diving.

From this midway point the
Pirates continued to widen their
margin. In the 200-yard back-
stroke Richard Holt lowered the
school record to 2:19.35, although
this time was good only for sec-
ond place. After this. a pair of
superbly conditioned Pirates
swam away with the 500-yard
freestyle, settling-the issue if not

the final score.

In the. final events Davidson
came on stronger. Though he al-
so placed second. Eddie Beach
lowered the. school mark in the
200 yard breaststroke to 2;35.5.
