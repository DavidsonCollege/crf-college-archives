Honor Chairman Warns of Food Foraging

_ the Honor Code. With these ideas

To Members of the
College Community,

A disturbing trend has spread
throughout Patterson Court in re-
cent weeks, escalating withalarm-
ing rapidity. It has become all too
common for students to drift into
houses of which they are not
members and take food from that
house’s facilities. The food ateach
Patterson Court house is paid for
by the members of that house and
is therefore their-property. Stu-
dents do not simply have the right
to take food from another Patter-
son Court house simply because it
is not under lock and key, and
attitudes reflecting such beliefs are
a far cry from being in the spirit of

in mind, I wish to alert you to some
specifications stemming from the

Honor Code that are effective im-
mediately:

-Taking food from the kitchen
or from a refrigerator outside the

kitchen of a Patterson Courthouse |

of which one is not a member
without permission from a mem-
ber of that house is stealing and
will therefore be considered a vio-
lation of the Honor Code.

Use your common sense. If it
isn’t yours, don’t take it. If you
don’t think it was made accessible
for you, find something else to eat.
Food on Patterson Court that you
did not pay for is still food that you

did not pay for and that does not
belong to you.

Students who take food from
the kitchen of their own house
against the rules of that house will
be dealt with by the executives of
the house; such actions will not be
considered Honor Code violations.

It seems that perhaps some
students have adopted the attitude
that stealing is acceptable as long
as itis notcovered under the stipu-
lations of the Honor Code. Such
attitudes reduce the Honor Code to
little more than a set of rules; sim-
ply going through the motions of
what the Code specifies, not tak-
ing to heart its ideals and prin-
ciples, completely subverts its

Insensitivity, Harassment and Assault

To the Editor:

After reading the
Davidsonian’s coverage of the
Select Committee’s Report on
Alleged Intolerance as well as the
report itself, Iam deeply disap-
pointed in the reactions of many of
my fellow students. While the
complaints regarding SAE-bash-
ing are in some cases justified, the
attitudes expressed by many stu-
dents indicate that toomany people
are missing the. big picture and
focusing instead on less signifi-
cant details.

The big picture is this: Insen-
sitivity, harassment, and outright
assault exist and must be stopped.

Men and women, whites and mi-
norities do not understand each
other as well as we could, and this
misunderstanding lies at the root
of many of our problems on cam-
pus. “Somemen believe that when
a woman says “NO!” she really
means, “Not yet.” Some women

_ naively think that wecan say “NO!”

‘

just once, and the message will
reach the man with whom she is
involved at the moment. Some
whites feel they can call someone

a “nigger” without intending to
seersiel that person’ srace. Some

“blacks intérprét racist actions ofa *-

few Whites as representative of all
light-skinned Americans. We don’t
understand each other’s feelings

and perceptions, and we don’t re-
spect what we don’t understand.
Respectis the key to treating people
like Human Beings.
Unfortunately, people notonly
have these perceptions in their
heads, but we also act on them
without thinking about the conse-
quences. WEare mostlikely toact
without thinking when we have
been drinking heavily. The social
abuse of alcohol is clearly sup-
ported at Davidson. Of course,
most people don’t say, “Hey dude,
it’s really uncool if you don’t get

Louria Sees Good in Fraternities

To the editor,

I have just recently had an
opportunity to read the report by
the Select Committee on Alleged
Intolerance, and it is quite disturb-
ing. lamastounded thatacommit-
tee that isin no way representative
of the feelings of the majority of
the student body can blithely go
around pointing fingers and con-
demning the fraternity system in
general and the Dean of Students
Office in specific as the root of all
evil on the Davidson Campus.
This committee would have you
believe that fire which will destroy
the Davidson community is being
actively disseminated from the

fraternities, and the Dean of Stu-
dents office is passively observing
while Davidson burns. Both these
perceptions are erroneous. :
Admittedly, the fraternity sys-
tem at Davidson is not perfect, and
it does have some problems that
need to be addressed, but as a
member of a fraternity, it is dis-
heartening and frustrating to be
subjected to. harassment (and |
choose this word deliberately) from
certain individuals in this commu-
nity who have not attempted to
understand exactly what Patterson

Court and the fraternity san is

all about.
Instead, these individuals

would rather go on rumor and
hearsay. . This is what forms the
contentof their “knowledge” about
fraternities. Last year, two profes-
sors came down toa party to expe-
rience the court for themselves.
No doubt they had heard the ru-
mors about what went on down at
the court, but they decided to do
their own research.

The fact that they had a good
time (which they did!) is not the
point. The point is the professors
were willing toexperience the court
for themselves, and then and only
then did they feel qualified to pass

McCulloh Corrects Error

To the editors:

Please allow me to correct an
inaccuracy in last week’s article
“Davidson to Welcome German
Professor” (The Davidsonian,
March 23, 1992). Thereference in
the article to the end of departmen-
tal “homogenity” is the result of a
misunderstanding. Reporter Will
Boye and I spoke very briefly last
week; and I obviously failed to
stress certain arene distin:
tions.

Women have in the past taught
(and one currently teaches) Ger-
man at Davidson; the regular, full-
time appointments. traditionally
have been held by men.., Dr. Eliza-

‘beth Waghall, who will join the

faculty in the fall, will be the first
woman to occupy .a full-time,
tenure-track position as a teacher
of German. However, it should
be pointed out that a woman al-
ready holds a full time position in

our Department, though she is not
a teacher of German. Professor
Bonnie. Marshall joined the De-
partment in 1987 as a teacher of
Russian, at which time the moni-
ker “German Department” for
“Department of German” became
obsolete, replaced by “Department
of German and Russian”.

C. Shaw Smith:
A Magician in
More Ways Than One

By Thomas Helland

C. Shaw Smith was a very
special person. He extended him-
self to others when they were down
and needed a-shoulder to Jean on.
His door was always open, and
when you entered, you immedi-
ately felt a good feeling in your
heart about this man. He was a
very warm, sharing man who ex-

tended himself towards you in all

circumstances. Even if it was just
abrief visitin the postoffice (where
I frequently encountered him) he
made you feel good about yourself
and others, and that made him feel
good.

My Senior year in high school
I signed a letter of intent to play
basketball af Davidson. A mutual
friend of ours called to congratu-
late me, and she told me that her
graduation present to mewas Shaw
Smith. I did not know what treas-

“ure this present would turn out to
. be. The day I flew up for freshman

orientation, Shaw greeted me at
the airport as if he had known me
for years.

He took me to lunch, helped
me move into my room, and helped
me establish a bank account. At
Thanksgiving, he invited my
mother and me to his home to share
Thanksgiving dinner with his wife

Nancy, and the rest of his family.
Our relationship took off from
there.

I ventured over to their house
every now and then to talk with
him. Every visit was'a special
visit, I always left there feeling
good about everything. My last
visit with Shaw was the day before
he passed away, and the conversa-
tion wentlike all the other ones did

-<-- relaxing, fun, resourceful, intui-

tive and inquisitive. When I went
over there, he would always ask
me how my parents were doing,
how my sister was, did she have a
job yet, did I have ajob yet. He was
very interested in myepursuit of
graduate school, and he wanted to
be informed whenever I heard,the
results.

Shaw didn’tneed to pulladove
out of a hat to put a‘smile on a
person’s face. He was indeed a
magician in more ways than one.
He could manage a smile out of a
child or an adult with the, same
ease. Shaw’s passing is not the
hard part. The hard part will be ad-
justing to life without such a won-
derful man. My hat is off to you,
Shaw.

‘take an extreme risk-- I decided to spy in-on a house meeting. All of my
darkest fears were realized. Pledges were being forced to placea pintof.
their blood in front of an altar that had the word “Beezelbub” engraved
below it. Pigs’ heads were on sticks throughout the house. Male
chauvinist chants rang throughout their den. Babies were being sacri-

-ficed. All of this I observed in just minutes-- for I feared being discov-

ered by a group of such “Sick boys.”

My evidence is overwhelming. SAE is Satan Incarnate. The
solution is obvious. SAE should be forever banished from our beloved
campus. I strongly feel that this would solve all of the problems that have
infested Davidson all year. Racial tension would become a thing of the
past. Homophobia would likewise be lifted. There would no longer be
hunger in the world. Natural disasters would cease tooccur. All damage
to the ozone layer would be nullified. Most importantly, world peace

would finally be realized.

But I suggest we do not stop here. SAE. is the most heinous of a
hellish group. The fraternity system must be replaced. In its place, I
support the simply brilliant plan to randomly assign students to eating
houses. This would weed out the students who wanted to lead a normal
life and would place a firmer emphasis on academics and social i inept-

ness.

There is a disturbing undercurrent of frivolity rippling through the
Davidson community. These undesirable trends will soon explode if the
SAE’s, and all supporters of the dastardly fraternity system, are not
stopped immediately. Once this is achieved, I firmly believe that
Davidson College will become the monastic haven thatall true Davidsoni-

ans hope and pray it can be.
