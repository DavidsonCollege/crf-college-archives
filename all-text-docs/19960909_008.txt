Burn the “Red Books.” Our
new Alcohol Policy doesn’t de-
serve to be printed in the same
book as the Honor Code. Where
the Honor Code is simple, con-
science-driven, and workable, the
Alcohol Policy is convoluted, over-
regulatory, and potentially destruc-
tive for Patterson Court. But per-
haps that’s exactly what’s intended.

The creators of this policy

began with a sound idea: kegs had .

to go. Kegs increase liability and

are prohibited at most schools. Fair

enough. But instead of replacing
the “keg rules” with a set of rea-
sonable new rules, the new policy
provides for a system with more
regulation and less rationale.

You would have thought it
was the coming of the second
flood. The way my mother talked,
strapping a small inflatable raft to
the bottom of my car seemed the
thing to do. She left a frantic
message on my voice mail Thurs-
day afternoon that would have sent
the west coast into hysterics. “Kay,
sweetheart, it’s Mama. Ijust talked
to your Aunt Marion in South
Carolina about this hurricane, and
she told me exactly what you need
to do.” She proceeded to repeat
one of 10 or 15 forecasts I had
heard circulating campus, then
listed the specific duties 1 must
complete in preparation for the
storm. I had remained fairly calm
all day through the many predic-
tions of a second Hugo

How many bureaucrats does
it take to run a Patterson Court
party? Enough to make the federal
government look efficient. Veri-
table armies now scout the houses
at party-time, the ranks of which
include House Presidents, Social
Chairs, “IDers,” Risk Managers,
Sober Monitors, Bartenders, Door,
Monitors, and Police Officers
armed with .9 mm handguns. Since
the new policy claims to support
North Carolina law, maybe each
party staffer should apply for a
permit to carry aconcealed weapon.

Asis consistent with past poli-
cies, houses may choose to pro-
vide beer or allow BYO. Under
the new policy, however, neither

outage meantno vending machines
in the dorms, so I snatched up a box
of Oatmeal Cream Pies and tucked
itsecurely into my basket. Istocked
up on cans of pineapple and tropical
fruit cocktail. (Wouldn’t want to
develop scurvy after being pinned
up without Vitamin C for so long.)
Salad green tuna. Apples and
canned chunk chicken. My usual
diet coke was hard to pass up, but
I realized that this was no time for
petty soft drinks. This was about
survival, and that meant water.
When I came to the bread and milk
shelves, my heart stopped. Milk
and bread were biggies, and there
were none to be had. Despair-
ingly, I moved to the pool of
shoppers in the checkout area and

option proves inviting. Instead of
providing incentive for BYO
events, the rules become more strin-
gent. Forms and paperwork bom-
bard the guest or member at the
front door. Students must deposit
their beer with the house, but the
house can’t return what individu-
als don’timbibe. The policy claims
to define BYO quantity limits in
“Section VIII, 3, b.” But,
surprise...no Section VIII, 3, b,
exists.
“Organization-supplied
events,” on the other hand, allow
for a total of 25 cases of beer. By
labeling these events “organiza-
tion supplied,” though, the rule
itself increases the house’s liabil-

mirror, I could see them bickering
over the pump. .
Afraid that Fran might for-

ward my mail, I stopped at the post ~

office on my way back to school,
then searched for a tree-free area to
park and left my fully-fueled car
for the safety of my dorm. I lugged
my groceries and mail up the stairs
and into my room, locking the door
behind me. My fortress woud be
impregnable. I passed several hur-
ricane-emergency fliers along the
way, and under my door was an-
other memo about hurricane pro-
cedure. I put away all the grocer-
ies, satin my armchair, and waited.
I waited and: waited and waited.
Finally, I went to bed, but with the
full expectation of being violently

and high winds and loss
of power, but something
about your mother’s
voice strikes acord. Sud- -
denly it was “Return of
Hugo” and Davidson

roused in the middle of
the night. But it never
happened. The next day,
after a solid sleep I was
surprised to discover it
had only rained and got-
ten a bit windy. Fran
never came. Fran stood
me up. Fran broke our

the rainbow, and in the
dark, no less. Needless to say, I
panicked. No sooner had I set the
receiver down than I set out to
fight Fran.

“Milk and bread! Milk and
bread!” That was my battle cry as
I stormed Harris Teeter. My pri-
mary concern, as always, was food.
Unfortunately, it was everyone
else’s too. I think all of Davidson
and Cornelius got calls:from their
mothers on Thursday afternoon.
It was the flood before the flood—
people everywhere charging down
the aisles with overflowing bug--
gies as if we really were in for
forty days and forty nights of Fran.
Grabbing the basket at the door, I
plunged into the sea of shoppers
and began raiding the shelves—
what was left on them. Despite
my extensive supply back at the
dorm, I grabbed more instant
oatmeal and grits, imagining my
magical microwave would still
operate after the power went out.
I did, however, realize that power

tacked myself onto one of the lines,
picking up a Three Muskateers as
I waited, just in case one of my
frequent chocolate cravings should
occur while Fran held me in my,
room.

My next stop was the gas sta-
tion. I had half a tank, but Mother
insisted I fill up because gas pumps
go with the power, and she didn’t
want me to be stranded. SoI pulled
into the Texaco, where vulture-
like vehicles were positioned to
pounce on vacated pumps. Twice
I circled the station in my shark of
acar, unable to snag a spot. I drove
to the campus and back and circled
the stationed twice before battling
a blue pick-up truck for a space. I
pumped and paid—picking up a
Moon Pie while inside (you never
know)—and got back into my car
and drove away. A mini-van anda
compact car were already inching
toward me from both ends, and
when I pulled out, they went head
to head. Looking in my rear-view

date, and I got stuck with
the bill.

Inretrospect I feel silly. “Milk
and bread! Milk and bread!”
Funny, here at school I don’t gen-
erally drink milk or eat bread, and
I’mnot big on water, either. [don’t
keep sweets or snacks in my room,
and I don’t drive my car very often.

So, I suppose my adventures
in hurricane preparation were un-
necessary, but can’tsay I’msorry.
Had I not prepared, Fran would’ ve
ripped through here with all her
might, and after seeing the incred-
ible images of destruction and hear-
ing the heart-wrenching horror sto-
ries of others, I realized that Fran
didn’t pass everyone by.

Talking to locals about the
devastation of Hugo a few years
back also puts the threat into per-
spective.

You can never take nature for
granted, and playing it safe is never
silly and it always pays to be pre-
pared, or at least to feel like you
are.

ity—no matter who purchases the
beer. Recognizing the problems
associated with these regulations,
several house officers have already
resigned.

Moststudents perceive the “25
case rule” as a restriction of the
previously allowable volume of
beer. As.aresult, pre-parties have
increased, and off-campus options
have become more attractive. More
drinking-and-driving will follow.
Sticking houses between a rock
and a hard place, the policy then
charges them to come up with a
way “‘to prevent drinking and driv-
ing even when the event is on cam-
pus.”

Davidson’s new alcohol

God Save the Court

policy doesn’t attack liability, and
it doesn’t attack alcohol. It attacks
Patterson Court and the social sys-
tem as we know them. In the end,
the policy’s practical problems pale
in comparison to the anti-Court
sentiment behind them.

The real issue here is the fu-
ture of the Court itself. If the
powers that be ultimately plan to
eliminate Patterson Court, let us
debate it openly. The Court is
about a lot more than alcohol: it’s
about, leadership, service, and
friendship. It helps produce well-
rounded Davidson undergraduates,
and that’s something many stu-
dents and alumni still care about.
God save Patterson Court.

Lest you think there was noth
ing tocomplain about this early in
the year— never fear; if you look
hard enough, you can always find
something (or maybe I have too
much free time).

If I park my car illegally in
Charlotte or Davidson (town of),
I get a ticket for five or eight
dollars. However, if I pull up in
frontof RUSK, put my hazards on
and run in for ten seconds to get a
bagel I get a ticket for fifty bucks.
Is thatajoke? Tickets at Davidson
are thirty and fifty dollars. Really
now. I mean, we fork out twenty-
four grand a year (give or take) to
go here and I cannot fathom what
possible explanation, justification
or necessity there could be for
these ticket prices. Now, if you
park in a handicapped parking
place and you get a ticket for
$100, you deserve it. If, however,
you have to pay fifty dollars torun
into house meeting at SAE or to
grab your sneakers out of your
room in Knox, that is just

ridiculous and unnecessary.

Beyond that... itcosts eighty
dollars to register your car here.
My freshman and sophomore
years it was $40, last year it was
$60 and this year it’s $80. Now,
Imay not be aneconomics major,
but I promise you that national
inflation rates were not quite that
steep. Where is this money go-
ing? AmI unaware of our recent
foray into the nuclear warhead
industry? Are we funding
Spielberg’s next picture?. Seri-
ously. If I find out that we’re
saving up to put an olympic pool
in front of apartment F, I'll feel
differently, but until then, it just
seems silly. It may appear to the
powers that be that we are a
campus of Beemers and
Hummers, but that does not mean
that we ‘all walk around with
wads of hundreds in our back
pockets. Basically, there’s just
no need.
