Mysteries of Chambers revealed

By Towner Blackstock

Never fear, Susan Beale; the
answers to your questions of last
week and more await you. Here’s
all you ever wanted to know about
Chambers Building and its statues,
roof, and bell:

The two statues above the en-
trance to Chambers are the Cham-
bermaids. If you look closely you
will notice that they are laughing at
us poor overworked students. In-
trospection stands on the left hold-
ing amirrorandabook. The statue
on the right, Expression, sports a
writing quill and another book. The
two women lean against a stylized
version of the college seal, which
symbolizes the tri-

President on the pediment. Appar-
ently, the College condoned, per-
haps even directed, that effort.
Students also could not stay
off the roof of New Chambers.
Photos show fraternity men of the
‘20s visiting the roof after their
initiations, held in what we now
call Perkins Auditorium. Back
then, it was an unfinished room of.
somber stone. With the remodel-
ing of 1961 and the subsequent
boarding up of the four great win-
dows, Perkins definitely lost its
grand charm. The roof, however,
still calls students. Some dare to
climb the tall trees flanking the

front columns; I have even seen .

bell (if we are not going.to ring it
anymore) might be on a memorial
platform on Richardson Plaza, or
even in front of Chambers.
Icannot helpbutmentionsome
pranks involving the bell. -In the
last century it was habit for stu-
dents to try to steal the College
Bell in hopes of not hearing its call
to wake up for classes. Others
would ring it at night and run away.
In one case, the night-time mis-
chief-makers continued to clang
the bell until the faculty arrived,
but then beat off the beleaguered
professors with rocks and sticks.
About ten years ago, a couple of
jokers found the switch inside
Chambers for the

umph of Provi-
dence and learn-
ing over evil. The
piece is huge, with
the Chamber-
maids: standing
larger than life.

notice that [the two statues]

‘poor overworked students

College Bell. Late
at night, they
would sit in the
basement with the
switch laughing,
while the police ran
around outside

People do indeed climb the
roof of Chambers. I’ve done it
myself a few times. I remember
sitting on the dome of Chambers
with a couple of friends one morn-
ing, waiting for the sun to finish
rising. Aman walking towards the
front entrance of Chambers from

the direction of the Guest House -

waved and called out, “Don’t fall!”
We then realized it was Dr. Kuyk-
endall.

People have climbed the roof _

of Chambers since the completion
of Old Chambers in 1858. The
open-aircupola on top gave folks a

spectacular view. One could even -

get onto the cornice of the massive
_ front pediment (the triangular gable
held up by columns) through a
small hatch which blended into the
pediment face. I have seen photos
of people wandering all-over the
roof. Apparently, no one minded.

Back in 1915 when Woodrow
Wilson visited Davidson, some-
one painted a large likeness of the

some folks using rappelling gear
to do that. I have always gone
through the attic, climbed one flight
of stairs, gone through the roof
hatch, and voila. Of course, to get
on the dome takes a little more
effort. A pair of climbing shoes
helps. The view is great, consider-
ing that once you get to the top of
the dome you stand fully six sto-
ries above some of the highest
ground in Mecklenburg county.
While on the roof, you might
walk around to the back of the
dome to see the College Bell. The
burning of Old Chambers in 1921
destroyed the old bell, so the next
year Brevard McDowell ‘69 do-
nated the present one. An impres-
sive inscription dedicates it to those
Davidson students who made the
ultimate sacrifice during World
War One. Its very place on the roof

‘has caused the community to all

but forget the dedication, and its
recent silence does not help. Per-
haps a more fitting place for the

with their flashlights pointing up
at the roof. In that year the Physi-
cal Plant was instructed to cut off
the power to the Bell during Com-
mencement in case the mysterious
“malfunctions” might start up dur-
ing the ceremonies. .

There you have it: the myster-
ies of Chambers revealed. I am
sorry I cannot tell you about the
double hinges or how many deaths
can be attributed to them. But

before we run out of space, here is —

another mystery revealed: Yes,
Susan, people really have been
locked in the library both by acci-
dent (silly freshmen) and for fun
(silly upperclassmen). I remem-
ber hearing about one couple who
hid after closing with the intention
of performing some amorous ac-
tivities between the stacks. They
had no problem getting locked in,
but they were surprised to encoun-
ter in the library twoother couples
that night who had the same ‘idea
they did.

Germany are returning.

The classes of ’49 and ‘50
will hold a joint reunion; each of
the other classes will hold separate
reunions. Several events, however,
will bring the entire group together.

Friday, Davidson graduates

‘Dean Will Terry ’54 and President -
John Kuykendall.’59 will address

their classmates on “Reflections
ona Quarter Century at Davidson”
and “Davidson College Today”
respectively.

Saturday morning will feature
a cake race with cakes donated by
faculty and staff. A reception will

“follow at Baker Sports Complex

sponsored by the Davidson Ath-
letic Foundation.

Alumni service awards and a
Distinguished Alumnus award will
be presented Saturday afternoon.

A band party will be held for
the ‘69 and ‘74 classes in the 900
Room of the Union on Saturday
night. Tony Orsbon, class of ’69,
says that those involved are really
excited about their 25th.reunion.

John Cook, assistant to the
director of Alumni Relations, says
that this year’s Alumni Weekend
will be smaller than last year’s
reunion of over 1100 alums be-
cause some classes opted to hold
their reunions on Homecoming
weekend this year.

Cook says that 25 to 30 stu-
dent volunteers will help staff the
various dinners and receptions.

The Alumni Relations staff,
including Nancy Blackwell, Denise
Allen, Linda Kunkle, Brian Tarr,
and Matt Terrell, has been work-
ing hard on the weekend

Quips & Cranks to be
published in fall

By Carrie Blackburn

Spring no longer means stu-
dents signing yearbooks to pro-
crastinate. Traditionally,Quipsand
Cranks has been issued in the
spring, but this year students will
have to wait until next fall.

Editor-in-Chief Angela Cap-
illary decided to switch to a fall
delivery date, which most colleges
have, because “too much was miss-
ing,” including spring sports, ac-
tivities, and graduation.

Capillary says, “It’s going to
be alittle bit later... but what’s in
it is good.”

Response to the late publica-
tion date has been generally favor-
able, especially since graduation
will be included. “At first,” says
Capillary, “people are surprised,
but when I explain, they think it’s
really cool. They want to have a
quality book.”

Senior Francis Mitchell
agrees: “Signing them is not really
abig deal like it was in highschool,
so it’s fine with me.”

During the last week in Au-

gust, yearbooks will be mailed to
seniors at their home addresses.
Quips and Cranks will use $1,000
of its $30,000 budget to cover the
shipping costs.

Previously, the yearbook staff
has had to complete the entire book
by. March. The additional sec-
tions, however, place a greater de-
mand on staff members. Capil-
lary, who stayed on campus until
Christmas Eve to meet.a deadline,
will remain on campus after gradu-
ation to continue work on the year-
book.

Capillary says the staff has
tried to make the yearbook more
representative of the entire student
body. They have made an attempt
to recruit pictures from a variety of
students, but when student response
is minimal staff members must rely
on their friends, creating an imbal-
ance of representation. Student
comments also have been added
throughout the yearbook, espe-
cially in academics.

Capillary says, “The quality
of the book will be a lot better.”
