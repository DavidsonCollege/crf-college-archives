Wildcat wins Charlotte’s mayoral race

Kesey LILLEY
News Editor

Monday night in Charlotte, Da-
vidson alumnus Anthony Foxx ’93
was installed as mayor amidst a
packed room, receiving a standing
ovation when called to the podium
to take the oath of office.

In a speech that received a sec-
ond standing ovation and numer-
ous outbursts of clapping, Foxx
detailed his plan to improve Char-
lotte, noting the need to diversify
the economy, accelerate job growth
and improve the public education
system.

In the mayoral bid for Char-
lotte, Foxx faced Republican John
Lassiter, seeking to replace incum-
bent Republican Pat McCrory, who
served for 14 years.

With a 3,239-vote margin,
Foxx was declared winner shortly
after Lassiter conceded the race.
Compared to previous years, the
2009 mayoral race saw a surpris-
ingly high voter turnout, with Foxx
sweeping many predominantly
black districts, as well as precincts
that went red in past elections.

Foxx is now the youngest and
second black mayor that Charlotte
has ever seen; he is also the first
Democrat in 22 years.

“The remarkable story of Char-
lotte is not over,” Foxx said. “A
new chapter is beginning.”

Foxx grew up and attended high
school in Charlotte before going on
to attend Davidson College, where
he was elected as the first black stu-
dent body president.

Popular tradition of Winter Fest

KELLY WILSON
Staff Writer

On Saturday, Jan. 23, students
are invited to a new campus event,
Winter Fest, where there will be
food, games and music to enjoy.

“Originally, the Union Board,
Student Government Association
(SGA) and the Patterson Court
Council (PCC) planned on hav-
ing an event in November with an
afternoon portion and an evening
portion,” Union Board President
Allison Ruhe 710 said. “However,
it became apparent that it was not
possible within time constraints to
organize the event, so we ended up
moving it to next semester, with the
result being we had to eliminate the
afternoon part.”

“In light of recent discussions
surrounding alcohol at Davidson as
well as uniting the Davidson com-
munity, [these organizations] will
host an event to celebrate Davidson,
promote healthy drinking habits
and foster a greater sense of com-
munity amongst all members of the

oral office, as well as the first Democrat in 22 years.

lotte had I not gotten involved
student government at Davidson,”
Foxx laughed, “no question about
that.”

Foxx majored in history be-
fore attending NYU school of law,
where he was awarded the Root-
Tilden-Snow Public Interest Law
Scholarship.

“My experience in the 20 or
So years ago was that I could lead
people, and I could lead a diverse
group—diverse in every sense in
which you can think of it—to find-
ing common ground on issues,”
Foxx said. “That skill was honed
over 4 years at Davidson...I’ve

college,” Student Government As-
sociation President Meikaela Zwie-
ryznski ’10 said. “Specifically, the
student organizations want to en-
courage further social interaction
between students who choose to
drink and those who choose not to
engage in drinking.”

“As we see a clear divide in
our student community, we want to
do all that we can to build a bridge
between these groups,” she contin-
ued. “We believe that such unity
will foster a healthier, safer and
more rewarding social climate at
Davidson.”

Ruhe was unable to disclose
specific details about the event,
but she noted, “Be on the lookout
for publicity about it as soon as we
get back for spring semester! I can
tell you there will be music, food,
games and a lot more! There will
be things to do throughout the en-
tire Union.”

While this is the first Winter
Fest, Davidson used to host an
event called Mid-Winters, which
continued until the late nineties.

never lost my taste for seeing a
community come together to solve
problems. And that’s what we did
at Davidson and that’s what I hope
to do in Charlotte.”

After law school, Foxx worked
in Washington as a judicial clerk on
the U.S. Sixth Circuit of Appeals,
an attorney for the Civil Rights Di-
vision of the United States Depart-
ment of Justice and a staff counsel
to the U.S. House of Representa-
tives Committee on the Judiciary.

Foxx then returned to Char-
lotte where he served as an at-large
member of Charlotte City Council,
in which he participated in initia-

which had been a tradition for over
thirty years.

“It was one of three ‘big’
weekends for many years,” said
William Brown, Director of the
Alvarez College Union. “I don’t
know when it started. It had been
around a while when I arrived as a
student in 1966. In the days before
co-education these three weekends
— Homecoming, Mid-Winters, and
Spring Frolics — all had the same
formula. Guys living in Belk and
Richardson moved out and stayed
on mattresses that were added to
the rooms in other dorms. The va-
cated rooms were used by dates
coming in for the weekend.

“We had concerts at 8 p.m. on
Friday and Saturday nights fol-
lowed by a campus party provided
by the Union and fraternity par-
ties at off-campus locations both
nights,” he continued. “Often the
Union provided all night activities
— at least until 4 or 5 a.m. This was
in the days when alcohol was not
permitted on campus. In 1968, or
so, alcohol was allowed on cam-

tives for job growth and better pub-
lic safety and transportation.

Regarding his politics, Foxx
seeks to strengthen Charlotte’s
economy, prevent capital flight,
fight homelessness and job loss,
and better the transportation sys-
tem. He also hopes to implement a
new Public Safety Plan for the city,
support after school programs and
increase youth employment.

“As an average person grow-
ing up in Charlotte, I expected to
succeed,” Foxx said. “I expected to
succeed because of my family.”

pus, so the fraternity parties moved
to the houses, but the formula was
the same. In the eighties and early
nineties Mid-Winters usually fea-
tured Friday afternoon parties in
the 900 Room and Saturday after-
noon in the Commons.”

When Davidson became co-ed,
all weekends became more impor-
tant than they had been, and the
need for “big weekends” was not
as important. Mid-Winters slowly
faded out of the social scene at Da-
vidson because “there was not the
need for the old tradition,” Brown
said.

This year’s Wimter Fest will
be open to the entire campus. “We
want as many people to come as
possible!” Ruhe said. “There will
be something for everyone.”

Although the event is already
completely planned, anyone inter-
ested in helping run the evening on
Jan. 23 should contact alruhe.

For those interested in planning
general campus events, the Union
Board welcomes new committee
members.
