Deegan to play professional soccer

By MICHAEL KrRusE
Staff writer

While many of his classmates
presently riddle their minds with
career options and fret over enter-
ing the real world, Alex Deegan
has solidified his immediate post-
graduation plans.

MEN'S SOCCER

Deegan, who played in goal
from the fall of 1992 until last
month, recently signed a two-year
professional contract through 1998
with the United States International
Soccer League’s Wilmington
Hammerheads.

Deegan hopes Wilmington
will serve as a beginning to his
career, saying he would like to
“possibly go abroad or go up to the
next level, the MLS (Major League

Soccer). Those are the ultimate
goals. I would love to go abroad
next year.”

Considering the caliber of his
college Career, these future ambi-
tions seem possible for Deegan.

Allowing 0.87 goals a game
as a freshman from Connecticut’s
Staples High in 1992, Deegan
helped the Wildcats to a 17-5-5
mark and their one and only NCAA
final four appearance, held at
Davidson that year.

Davidson’s 1992 preseason
media guide anticipated: “What
are the chances of the Wildcats
playing in soccer’s ‘Final Four’ on
their home turf? Well, since the
‘Cats have never made the 28-
team tournament field and have
never finished higher than 21st in
the national polls, a spot among
this season’s top four would be
stretching it.”

But Deegan demonstrated that
“stretching it’ is.the only way to
go. He proved all critics and disbe-

Action from weekend's Davidson Quad meet

Hooff swims to
personal best

at Nike Cup

-Staff report

Senior men’s swimming team
captain Churchill Hooff turned in
excellent performances at the Nike
Cup in Chapel Hill over the week-
end.

SWIMMING

He swam to three lifetime best
times during the three-day event.
His time of 4 minutes, 37.18 sec-
onds in the 500 freestyle was good
enough for 16th, while he earned
Oth in the 1650 with a 16:07.20.

He also turned in a 1:43.21
time in the 200 free, which earned

him 18th, and another personal
record in the 100 free with a time
of 49.02.

His lifetime bests were part of
a weekend competition that, ac-

’ cording to Hooff, was his best since

coming to Davidson.

The only time he has swum -

any of these races faster was in the
200 at the 1994 Southern States
championship meet.

The meet was “‘a great reward
for [Hooff], who has done every-
thing right” during his years at
Davidson, said head swimming and
diving coach Rich DeSelm.

It afforded him a midseason
opportunity to swim against the
“best competition in the East this
year,” DeSelm said.

get to enjoy it.”

Ferrucci said that Wofford
couldn’t play at the tempo
Davidson set in the game on
Wednesday and that they basically
ran Wofford into the ground.
Davidson had balanced scoring in

the game with four players in
double figures, led by Ferrucci with
22 and Carolyn Kirsch, who poured
in 20 and grabbed 16 rebounds,
and:11 different players scored.
Ferrucci also stressed the impor-
tance of the fan involvement in the
game. "There was tremendous sup-
port for our team [at the first home
game], and that means the world to
the team,” Ferrucci said. “We had
a lack of support so now we appre-
ciate what’s there.”

lievers, even his school’s own
media guide, wrong.

“The 1992 season was incred-
ible. That was a special time for

everyone involved and this cam-

pus in general,” remembered
Deegan. "I will never forget those
four games during November and
December.”

Deegan played 365 straight ©

minutes of shutout soccer during
the four-game stretch and stopped
8 of 15 Coastal Carolina and UNCC
penalty kicks.

Despite disappointing, injury-
marred 1993 and 1994 seasons,
Deegan received many individual
honors throughout his Davidson
career, including second team All-
Southern Conference as a fresh-
man and first team as a senior. He
earned a spot on the all-tourna-
ment squad both of those years and
was named tournament most valu-
able player this fall.

Deegan will now take his tal-
ents to the professional ranks.

Wrestling pins Apprentice,
opens season with 1-2 record

By WILL BRADSHAW
Staff writer

The Davidson wrestling team
opened its home-season on Satur-
day in a quad meet involving The
Citadel, Coppin State, and Appren-

- tice.

WRESTLING

The Wildcats faced The Cita-
del to open the day and were de-
feated 36-3, then they narrowly
lost to Coppin State 22-21, but
rebounded to hand rival Appren-
tice a 27-13 defeat, giving them a
1-2 record for the season thus far.

“Apprentice was a milestone
for us,” coach Tom Oddo said.
“We have never been able to beat
them the last couple of years no
matter how hard we tried, so this
time was pretty satisfying. It ac-
complishes one of the goals I have
for the year.”

Ben Wall was 2-1 on the day
and was the only Davidson wres-
tler to win against The Citadel.
Oddo said that Wall would have
been 3-0 if he hadn’t moved Wall
upaweightclass (from 177 to 190)
against Coppin State.

“This guy was too big for
him,” Oddo said, about Wall’s
match-up against Coppin State.
“From the score it looks like he got
beat up, but Ben was doing most of

the action. The guy was just too big —

and countered him.”

Oddo was also pleased with
the performance of Christian Baker
(134), a freshman, who lost “two
incredibly close matches,” and
Miller Cary, who won in the 158-
pound class against Apprentice,
but wrestled up at 167 against
Coppin State and lost..

“I was a little disappointed
with the outcome of The Citadel
match. It was our first of the day

and I thought we could have done
better, although we had a lot of

because of academic conflicts. In
addition, Tom Greene, Ben Wall,

close matches. I’ll compliment
Citadel on having a strong team,
but L also think it would have been
different if we had wrestled them

~ third inStead of in'thé first match,’ as

Oddo said.

Oddo also said the team will
get better once they have more
practice time, and some of the key

people missing have returned. Sean

Harvey is out for six weeks due to
knee surgery, and Aaron and Jesse
Kenner-have not been wrestling

and Seth Herman all had to lose 20
pounds inthe last week to get down
to weight, Andy Sterling has had
only one week of practice, and this
méet was Chip SteWwart’s ‘first at
heavyweight.

“When we get all the wres-
tlers back it will be different,” he
said. “After we have one month of
practice under our belts, as long as
we stay healthy, [Sean] Harvey
will be the only one out at that

point.”
