Arab relations specialist discusses terrorism

David E. Long °59. the Middle Eastern Area Officer for the Office of
Counter-Terrorism in the U.S. State Department. spoke on international ter-
ronsm at the Dean Rusk Forum on Thursday. October 24.

Long. a specialist in Arab relations, said that one of the main problems of
terrorism is to define it. “One man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter.”
he stated. adding that this ambiguity causes difficulty in isolating an enemy
other nations can work to counter.

Another problem. Long pointed out. 1s to determine who committed vanous
terronst acts. He said many countnes will openly oppose terronsm while sec-
retly they support it. for terronsm ts a relatively inexpensive form of violence in
comparison to the amount spent on open warfare.

One aspect of terronsm which Long has seen throughout the world ts that ter-
ronsts all seem to have a sense of hopelessness in solving the problems they
tace

Long serves on the Advisory Council for the Dean Rusk Program and also
helps with the Davidson in Washington Program.
