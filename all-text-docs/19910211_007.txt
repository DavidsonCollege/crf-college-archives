Support Troops,
Oppose Order to War

By James Pittard '87

U. S. troop are patriotically
and skillfully following orders in
the Gulf. We must personaly sup-
portthem in-whatever way-we can
and honor the sacrifices they make
on behalf of our country.

It is President Bush’s respon-
sibility to: ensure the historical
meaning of the troops’ sacrifices.
Their sacrifices will be great.

When the President gave the

united behind the troops now that
the war has begun, but the issues
that created the debate will not go
away.
-The troops. must force them-
selves totrust the Presidentin order
to faithfully continue in their duty,
but they will have their doubts --
now, when they return, or in their
dying thoughts.

We cannot look to censorship
tocontrol the thoughts of the troops.

At no point has the President given a satisfac-
tory explanation for going to war, and the
troops' morale suffers accordingly.

orders to wage war, he knew U.S.
troop casualties were estimated as
high as 45,000 - 125,000 and that
physical and psychological dis-
abilities resulting from the war
could be in the range of 300,000.

The President knew that V. A.
health care is not adequate for the
veterans of previous wars, and that
there will be little money with
which to care for the veterans of
this one.

President Bush knew that the
war would add at least
$80,000,000,000 directly to the
already huge federal deficit. He
knew that the veterans could re-
turn to. a failed economy which

would:not: suppoort: the: lifelong
education; rehabilitation, and job
preference benefits which they
deserve..

The sacrifice, he said, was
necessary.

Yet at no point has the Presi-
dent given a satisfactory explana-
tion for going to war, and the troops’
morale suffers accordingly.

Thertesolution authorizing the
President to go to war included
only 53% of the Senate. The Sen-
ate and much of the country have

They are many of the best and
brightest that our society produces.
In manipulating the media, more-
over, Our government robs the
servicepeople of a real history of
the war.

Nor can we blame those who
protest Bush’s order to war forlow
morale among the troops. Peace
demonstrators have given support
to the troops from the beginning,
and they continue to do so. Many
demonstrators are family of serv-

‘icemenand women. In many cases,

they actasa voice for soldiers who
have been threatened by their
commanders for saying what they
know to be true.

- Those protesting Bush’s war
offer ‘relief to servicemen and
women whoare beginning to doubt
their own sanity amid censored
informantion and the stress of war.
They offer the hope of anend tothe
madness and a safe return home.

Let us set the record straight,
and call an end to the sacrifice of
the heroes of this war.

Damn computers. I just lost
my entire column, “Ten Sugges-

kind of liked it, and I’m sorry it’s
gone, but I’m glad for the memo-
ries have of the good times we
shared, and it is from those fond
memories that I will forge a new
brace for myself and manage to
go on living. There are a few
complaints to which I must re-
spond, however, so I'll make this
brief.

Defining Feminism

From A Personal Perspective

By Sandra Smith '91

On March 29, 1989 Lused poor
judgement and went running after
dark, alone. As I approached the
overpass on Main Street in Cor-
nelius (near Carolina Cones), I was
assaulted. | The aggressor was a
male much larger than me. I
screamed. As I struggled to es-
cape his grip, he told me to shut up
or he would kill me. Just as my
walkman headphone cord was
tangling around us both, Isaw what
I thought at the time was a beam of
light shining down from my Crea-
tor, and Gabriel’s horn playing my
death tune. Quickly I realized that
it was the headlights of an Old-
smobile, driven by abearded Good
Samaritan blowing his hom toscare
the attacker away.

about feminism. I can no longer
feebly acquiesce to the assumed
notions andallegations made about
feminism on thiscampusandabout
the feminist movement in general.
While I will not be so pretentious
as to say that I will set this mis-
guided dispute straight, I may be of
some help. Remember, however,
that I can only speak for myself.
My favorite definition of a
feminist is: a) a person who be-
lieves that women should have
political, economic and _ social
rights equal to those of men; b) one
who believes the implementation
of feminist principles will create a
more equitable balance of justice
and power for all. I consider a
feminist as someone who resists

on equality. I do hope no female
thinks she. has to be “‘a man in a
man’s world” to be treated as an
equal. The feministmovement has
come along way, and is attempting
now to focus on a woman’ s choice
as the most important thing, based
on her equality of opportunity
(which, by the way does not exist
in its purest form, legally or so-
cially), Personally, (as you might
guess, I am a feminist), to avoid
two extremes, I would no more
want to propel myself along the
patriarchal, imperialistic corporate
ladder, than have my period and
wear a tampon every single day of
the month. But! am a woman, and

Iam glad I am a woman.

get the sound of my own voice
screaming from lungs with im-

haustible capacity for noise.

I am telling you about out this
incident, two years after the fact,
for several reasons, none of which
are to receive attention, or God
forbid, any sympathy. I do so
because peopleon this campusneed
tobe. awakened not only. to the
injustices of this society, and to be
aware that rape, sexual harassment
and abuse take place, but we need
to take responsibility for our own
actions and attitudes.

. Two fundamental feelings
arose from my attack. The first was
fear--fear for myself, my friends
and my sisters. I had a fear of
shadows, of strangers walking
behind me, of large trees behind
which aggressors may lurk, and
most of all laying awake at night
and ‘getting stuck in a negative
thought cycle. I have dealt with
these overwhelming emotionsand
am: quite secure now... However,
the feeling I will never get over
was fact that my privacy was vio-
lated in an extreme measure, not
for sexual reasons, but for violent
reasons. I was assaulted because I
was a woman.

_ What prompted me to write
this column was not recurring bad
dreams of the unfortunate incident
described above, but rather the
absurd, generalized, and oversim-

. plified debate in the Davidsonian

preassigned definitions of gender
which confine all people and limit
them from reaching their full
human potential. I believe that all
persons should be evaluated,
treated, and judged as individuals
based on her/his own merits, abili-
ties and interests. This includes
control of her/his own body, sex-
ual preference, reproductive rights.
T must respond to an article
which appeared by Stephen Hill,
“Feminism Reexamined.” Not
only did Mr. Hill assume that all
feminists “divorce themselves
from traditional feminine quali-
ties,” but “by embracing more
masculine qualities, many women
have found themselves propelled
along the corporate ladder.” Mr.
Hill says that “they are losing a
vital part of themselves.” He says
that this repression is unhealthy.
Mr. Hill seems to forget that these
stereotyped characteristiecs, he
refers to are socially construed
notions, and thata healthy balance
of feminine and masculine prin-
ciples, is not only possible, but
healthy. I agree we should not
repress any inherent qualities, but
we should let blossom those quali-
ties which society refuses to ac-
knowledge based on our sex. No,
Mr. Hill, women do not have to
“prove to society the value of these
feminine qualities.” We have tobe
WHO we are, make our own
choices, and refuse tocomply with
absurd conditions some people put

think weshouldall
respect what feminism stands for
and not only respect each other as
human beings, but respect our-
selves as well. One fourth of us
will be graduating from Davidson
College in May. That means good-
bye sweet utopia, its a harsh world
out there. But is this utopia I am
referring to the same haven where
assault, date rape and abusive rela-
tionships occur? Is this the same
place where women suffer from
eating disorders, suffer from low
self-esteem, indulge in dependent
or co-dependent relationships, do
hot speak up in class and abuse
substances which often lead to un-
healthy situations?

I think many women and men
on campus are confronting these
issues, and I think its fantastic. A
feminist movement is not. going
anywhere until we learn to raise
our own consciousness and foster
self respect. | However, Liz
Davidson, inherarticle “Davidson
Defends Male Sex,” printed last
week, refuses to be associated with
the “bitterness that campus femi-
nists espouse”. Well, I am not
bitter, Ms. Davidson (slap my hand,
call me crazy). And if I-get out of
line, if1 seem “bitchy orirrational,”
as Ms. Davidson describes some
feminists, then call me a meno-
pausal militant wench.
