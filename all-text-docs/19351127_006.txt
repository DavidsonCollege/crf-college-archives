In the second act, Porter divulges his
murder scheme to the thugs, who
frankly skeptical until the plan is demon-
strated. The plot is to place cyanide in
the Crime Commissioner's tooth paste,
thus making the death appear to be heart
failure. The commissioner will be on the
train at this time, and Charlie has already
obtained tickets to the berth opposite his.
Instead of giving Charlie real cyanide, as
the thugs suppose, Porter has handed him
the harmless sugar that he has obtained
from his dinner tray. Some time after
Charlie has left, the couple receive word
that he has lost the “sugar cyanide” and
obtained the “real stuff’ from Herman's
drugstore. Now, as the third act begins,
Porter has three lives in his hands, the
Crime Toby's, and his

As the curtains part, Wally enters the
stage and sits down at the table in the

foreground. At a casual glance around
the room, his attention is drawn to.the
torn telephone wires from which the tele-
phone has been snatched in an early
scene, Virst he tries Morse Code with
the two ends, but finds this unsuccessful.
Then, after various manipulations, he
contrives, with the use of the radio, a
device that will enable him to not only
hear “central” but to get word to her.
By means of the contraption, he calls for
help and notifies Mr. McFarren, the com-
missioner, to get off the train. In the end,
the gang is scattered, Dillon seized, and
Porter telephones his last message to
the commissioner: “Don't brush
teeth tonight, Mr. McFarren.”

The play was directed by Dave Her-
ring and W. F. Pierce, and under the
direction of Prof. E. J. Erwin. The stage
managers were Earl Clark and Dunlap

Later, he was taken to a concentration

camp in France, where were detained
ilmost’ every kind of person, engaged in
almost every trade imaginable. From

these he learned much, which he could
not have learned any other way. He also
served the concentration camp as physi-
cian, being the only one. Thus he turned

even his greatest misfortune into great
good.

The concentration camp, however, told
on his health, and when invited to go
to Sweden to deliver’ a number of lec-
tures he was very low in health. How-
ever, the climate was excellent, and he
improved rapidly, finally becoming strong
enough to return to Africa, where he
continued with his work.

Schweizer’s philosophy of life consists
in doing one’s very best for the further-
ance of the Kingdom of God. He con-
siders that every man has a part, whether
he is a religious worker all the time, or
only as a side issue with his main work
of earning a living. Schweizer believes
that modern Christianity has covered up
the original Jesus, and that the way to
really find Him, is to study Him unen-
cumbered by human Additions and tra-
ditions, Schweizer has certainly found
Jesus, and made Him a mighty power in
his life. The thing, he says, that has kept
him faithful to the religion of Jesus, has
been constant far
from raising doubts, has only served to
confirm the faith of this wonderful man,
one of the greatest foreign missionaries
of all time.
