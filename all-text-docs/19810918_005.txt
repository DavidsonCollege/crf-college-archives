DAVIDSONIAN

Food service director
talks about year ahead

Mr. Carleton Pritchard is the head
of the new College Dining Service. He
comes to Davidson from the University
of Virginia, where he also headed the
dining service. The following quota-
tions are excerpted from an interview
with the Davidsonian on 8 September.

DAVIDSONIAN: How long were you at
the University of Virginia?

PRITCHARD: About seven years, and
before that about eight years at the Uni-
versity of Tennessee—Knoxville. DAVID-

SONIAN: Do you think this. isa fair
analogy: that the head of a college din-
ing service is something like a restau-
rant owner in that he sets the menu, and
he sets the style and atmosphere where
he serves the food?

PRITCHARD: You. could say that. A di-
rector of a college food service is a little
different from a regular restaurant own-
er. Basically the reason I’m here is to
assure the College and the students that
the students get nutritious meals. And
meals that contribute to their welfare at

the College. I like to think that the food .

service is part of the whole growing ex-
perience at college. Therefore I think
that the food should be interesting to
complement your experience at college
so that it’s not just there, so that it’s part
of the whole living, growing expe-
rience.

DAVIDSONIAN: How do you keep the
food interesting?

PRITCHARD: I’d_ say with special
events, such as international dinners.

DAVIDSONIAN:. What other kinds of
special events do you have planned?

PRITCHARD: Well, are you asking me
to give away all my secrets now? I think
it’s necessary for me to take a look at the
students. I ‘think the students need to

-react to what we can do, too.

DAVIDSONIAN: What social activities
will there be for the first term?
PRITCHARD: Well, what we’re inter-
ested in doing is getting the thing started
right. We don’t want to start a whole
bunch of things right off the bat. We’re
not going to get a whole lot of pizzazz
the first term. I think we need to react to
one another, and if I think that you need
something, I’ll say, ‘Well, what would
you like?’

DAVIDSONIAN: Will you be on the floor
at mealtimes?

PRITCHARD: I have been every meal so
far! I guess I’ll have to continue. Yes.

DAVIDSONIAN: What makes yours a
top-notch service?

PRITCHARD: The thing that makes any
food service successful is is a certain
amount of dedication to the idea behind
the food service and the college. My
strongest desire is to make us the best
food service in the country.

 DAVIDSONIAN: Do you plan to increase

the number of students eating at the.
Commons? Or do you plan on staying
the same size?

PRITCHARD: I think that depends on
Patterson Court. I think that if Patterson
Court stays as a vibrant force, then the
present proportion is about right.

DAVIDSONIAN: Do you think Patterson
Court will remain strong?
PRITCHARD: I think it is a good idea.

dent interest. Caldwell’s bakery pro-

Mr. Pritchard also plans several
special events at the Commons, - de-
pending on student reactions and sug-
gestions. The Commons will have a
make-your-own-sunde-night - every

other week. The Dining Service is pre- --
paring special international meals once

a month, featuring Chinese and Italian
foods the first few months. Mr. Prit-
chard said he would break in his ideas
for special events slowly because “‘it’s
necessary for me to take a look at.the
students and what they want to do.” He
also expects that “it will take about a
month to get things squared away.”

Mr. Pritchard comes to Davidson
from the University of Virginia where
he ran many special events, such as
monthly zodiac birthday parties; Okto-

berfests, Spring Flings, and Food Ser- -

vice Olympics. He said, “everything we
did was a success.”

The Dining Service has an almost
completely new staff of 40 professional
employees working to get the program
going. Pritchard said he retained only
the “three very best” workers from the
old ARA service. Senior Eric Sorensen
manages the 30 work study and 20 high
school students who also work for the
Dining Service.

The Commons’ full 19-meal din-
ing plan costs $1090 per year, slightly
more than most Patterson Court (PC):
houses (see table on p. 5). The College
has not yet finished paying for the Com-

. mons, so the final bill is undetermined,

but the original cost estimate was $3.6
million, according ‘to Comptroller Ro-
bert Davidson. The Dining Service’s

operational budget comes only from

student board bills, income from cater-
ing, and walk-in sales. Walk-in custo-
mers pay $3.10 for dinner, $2.75 for

lunch, and $2.25 for breakfast. Satur-
day dinner is $4.50 and Sunday dinner’s -

price is undetermined.

All 360 freshmen (and 200 upper-
classmen) are presently eating at the
Commons regularly. Mr. Pritchard said

he was not sure if the number of stu-

dents eating at the Commons would
grow. “I think that depends on Patterson
Court. I think if Patterson Court stays as
a vibrant force on campus the propor-
tion is about right.” He added, “I think
Patterson Court is a good idea.”

Dean of Students Will Terry thinks

_ it’s is too early to tell what permanent

effect the Commons will have on the
rest of Patterson Court. He speculated
that there are three possible effects, all
of which would help court houses.

First , “fewer people will be joining
houses to escape poor eating.” The peo-
ple joining court houses “will be look-
ing for something additional socially.”
Dean Terry expects that because “‘peo-
ple have used Patterson Court houses as
troughs without any commitment to the
people or the house” in the past, having
only dedicated members will be a be-
nefit.

Second, Dean Terry thinks the fra-
ternities will benefit because the con-
trast of the popular Commons will ac-
cent the importance of their fraternal at-
mos; .
Finally, Dean Terry said “The

- Commons is going: to. force all the

houses on the court to run a better opera-
tion in terms of management and fi-
nance.” He added, “I think the College
has an obligation to help the houses op-
erate better in cost accounting, purchas-
ing jointly,,, and strengthening the Pat-
terson Court Council (PCC). He pre-
dicts the houses “will have to surrender
some autonomy to survive.’

Secretary Keith Hearle said the
Commons “will lead to the houses im-
proving food quality or they are going to
lose sutudents.” PCC President Joni
Seehorn said that in addition, PC house

_ members néed to work on the appear-

ance of their houses, and to maintain an
attitude of caring about their houses.
She said one of the main advantages of
the Patterson Court is “‘a real shy sopho-
more can go in and meet everyone in the
house.”

Joni said the PCC hopes to arrange
to buy: food in codperation with the
Commons. She said the PCC will meet
informally with Mr. Pritchard early in
the term to introduce themselves and to
discuss codéperative buying.
