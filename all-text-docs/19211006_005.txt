THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 6, 1921.

THE PEANUT PARCHER

An Eye Opener.
The day wore on.
What did it wear?
The close of day.

Bill Cooper to Bugs Robinson: “Bugs,
you are a math stud, eh?”

Bugs: “Yes.”

Bill: “Well, why won't a size 15 col-
lar go on over a size 7 hat?”

From appearances Sunday morning,
the Paper Hangers’ Union held meetings
in Georgia, Watts, and Rumple.

“Press Forward, Davidson,” was the
cry heard from a certain Sophomore at
a recent football game.”

White’s Studio representative trying
to sell Frank McLeod a dozen pictures:

Frank: “I haven't any use for a dozen
pictures.”

Rep.: “Well, you can put them up in
the stable and let the mule bray at
them.”

Corp. Hughes: “Jaybird, how do you
keep your hands so smooth?”

gloves.”

Corp: “Do you sleep in your hat,
too?” ef

‘John G.: “I’m looking for something
to do.”

Matt McC. (leaving the scene): “Well,
you can’t do me.”

“T have a fearful headache,” she com-
plained.

“T have heard of aching voids before,”
he cruelly remarked.

Foolish Questions.

What size collar does a neck of land
wear?

How long is a string?

How high is up?

Why is'a duck?

How far is near?
How many steps are there in the stairs?”

The following was heard at a certain
boarding house:

“What have we got for breakfast?”

“Hash.”

“Good, we haven’t had any since sup-
per.”
* As a closing number, Mr. Buster Lung
will render that little song, “It’s a mean
old-doggie that won't scratch his moth-
er’s fleas,”

Well Read.
Prof. Erwin: “Mr. Wright, have you
read Romeo and Juliet yet?”
Soc.: “No, sir; I haven’t read Romeo
yet but I have read Juliet twice.”

What happens when two Fords meet?
Dodge Bros.

The Greek III class gave Dr. Harding
a half-holiday Friday.

A book agent from Huntington, W.
Va., visited Mr. Harold Covington for
the week-end.

Rod: “Is that a player piano?”
She: “No, the pianist is so modest he
is hiding under the soft pedal.”

“Cab” Garrett was heard referring to
a.cash register as a Jew piano.

A young man in Charlotte was heard
to. say as a policeman entered, “Here
comes Little Boy Blue.”

We would like to know if:

You can call a Georgia undertaker a
Southern planter?

You can call a pillow a knap sack?

You can say that a young man who
marries an heiress, has a capital wife?

You can call a mail carrier’s uniform
a suit of mail?

On last, Saturday evening many of the
young people of Davidson spent a very
enjoyable evening in the home of Miss
Virginia Shoemaker at a birthday party
given by Miss Shoemaker, assisted by
Mr. P. D. Miller, of the Senior class.

A Gateway—Electrical

Y a forty-foot gateway bounded

by two brick pilasters and orna-

mental lamps, but ft is unlike any other
gateway in the entire world.

For back of it is the General Electric
Company’s main office building, accom-
modating 2300 employees. And just
next door is its main laboratory with the
best equipment for testing, standardiz-
ing and research at the command of ca-
pable engineers. Then down the street a
mile long—are other buildings where

electrical products. are

thousands of electrical workers who

made by the
transportation,

and electricity in the home.

Through this gate messages and repre-
sentatives from a score of other factories
and over fifty branch offices come and
go every hour—an endless chain of co-
ordinated activities carrying on and en-
larging the scope of over a quarter cen-
tury’s work for the betterment of

What a story this gate would tell, if it
could, of the leaders of the electrical in-
dustry and of ambassadors from other
industries and institutions—and from
foreign lands. The story would be the
history of electric lighting, electric
