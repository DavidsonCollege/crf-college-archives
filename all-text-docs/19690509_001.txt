THE RADAR

AN ANALYSIS
By BOB DUNHAM

Editor-in-Chief

Admittedly one of the most
difficult and futile tasks to-
day is the attempt to réget.-
erate for one’s contempo-
raries the excitement which
has been created by a sym-
posium or a conference.

It has certainly been true
of the conference held recent-
ly in Montreat by the Rich-
ardson Fellows for the dis-
cussion of admissions poli-
cies, the experimental college
and career studies.

Very few students have ac-
quired any impression of the
conference. Indeed, few even
know -it took place.

But those in attendance are
trying to recreate on campus.
a bit of the enthusiasm and
debate which was generated
by the students, faculty, ad-

ministrators and outside
guests who attended.

The spearheads of admis-
sions and the experimental
college from the Davidson
side were there and all spoke
their cases well, but the ex-
citement came from the out-
side speakers.

Edgar Whan, the director
of a program for unstructur-
ed education at Ohio Univer
sity. was the one who left
the greatest impression.

He spoke of the demands
of the black students af Ohio.
and their effect. He spoke of
grades and of liis changed
impressions of educational
aims.

He described the force with
which .the Negroes at Ohio
chtained their demands, and
he mixed humor and color
in noting that the deans met.
promptly at 8 a. m. the morn-

ing after the grievances were
presented, which was much
more. than white demands
had ever heen able to
achieve.

His analysis of the pro-
blem with the Negro today
or “the black thing.’ dealt
with regionalism.

“In the North the whites
say ‘I don't care how big
you get as long as you don't
get too close,”” Whan said.
“while in the South it’s. ‘!
don't care how close you
get as long as you don't get
too big.”

Whan told the conference
that Ohio used only A. B
and C in its grading scale.

“Grades are supposed to
show what you know.” he
said, “‘not what you don't
know.”

He spoke of an F on a stu

dent's record as ‘‘a big stink-
in’ albatross around his
neck,’ and said a professor
who gives F's is ‘power
mad."

An eloquent man with an
affinity for the colorful as
well as the course. Whan
fascinated the conference
with his description of his
educational conversation.

After describing his old
faith in the traditional uni-
versity, he then described his
somewhat apocalyptic view
of education when explaining
that “the world started blow-
in’ up. I got bored.”

“T used to say that the pur-
pose of a university was to
teach. and if you want to
learn about life. join the
Navy."’ Whan’ noted, but not-
ed that now he becomes “‘sus-
picious when ‘teach’ is used

Editor Joins
In Anti-War

By MARK. HODGES
News Editor
DAVIDSONLAN co-editor
Franklin Anderson has sign
ed a National Student Asso-
ciation resolution opposing
the Vietnam war and saying
that he will refuse induction
into the armed forces as tong

as the war continues.

Student Body President
Peter Hobbie and the other
N4AVITSONTAN co-edivor Bob
Dunham did not sign the
statement.

The NSA resolution, which
has heen siened by over 250
student bodv presidents and
collese newspaper editors, de-
clared opvosition to the Viet-
nam war because of its “tim
morality and  uniustness.”
The NSA sent a copy of the
statement to President Rich-
ard Nivon and also requested
a conference with him to dis-

cuss at greater length stu-,

dert ecaneern about the war
and the draft,

Andecvson said that he sign-
ed the resolution because “T
aesree with it fully and feel
thet to be honest with mv-
self T must sign. The noint
to me is that the United
States does not belong in the
Vietnamece war. It's a mis-
take beth politically and
morallv.”

“And also. my signine the
petition gets Davidson's
name on the list. and I think
that’s important,” he said.

Though he plans to be a
pre-ministerial student and
therefore may be exempt
from the draft. Anderson
said that he would refuse in-
duction if he should ever
become eligible for the draft
while the United States is
fighting in. Vietnam.

In connection with his sup-
port of the NSA association.
Anderson will go to Washing-
ton, D. C., this weekend to
take part in a conference un
campus disorders and pos-

sible campus reform as one
of 20 randomly-selected cam-
pus leaders who signed the
resolution.

Anderson said that the rea-
son for this conference is
that the Nixon administra-
tion has taken a potentially
repressive view toward cam-
pus disorders, and that the
NSA wanted to prepare a
positive statement on this
situation. based on this con
ference’s recommendation. A
copy of this new resolution
will be sent to President Nix
on.

Student Body President
Hobbie said that he agrecd
with the idea of the resolu-
tion ‘but that he didn’t sign
it because of his participation
in advanced ROTC and ‘his
“laek of strong commitment
to this ‘cause.”’

“Fm not really sure I
wouldn't go to Vietnam.
“Hobbie said. “You have to
feel very strongly before tak-
ing a step like this."

“The point to me is that
the motives of the United
States in Vietnam are not
wrong. I accept it as a mis-
take but not as immoral. If
I thought the United States
had gotten into Vietnam for
immoral reasons, I might re-
fuse to go.’ he said.

DAVIDSONIAN co - editor
Dunham agreed with’ the
principals of the resolution
but didn’t sign because his
signing might conflict with
another interest.

In a prepared statement on
the NSA resolution. Dun-
ham said:

“On the basis of very per
sonal considerations I have
decided not to sign the peti-
tion. My decision has come
after much evaluation and
consideration of the long-
term effect of my signing.”

“I whole-heartedly support

dormitories that do not al:
ready have new ones.

Creating three lounge
areas in the older residence
halls and improving existing
lounges.

General repair and paint-
ing work.

The college church this
summer will receive its first
major beauty treatment since
it was built 11 years ago.

Approximately: $200,000 has
been approved for this pro.
ject.

Effort

those persons who have elect-
ed to sign the statement, and
I will defend their stand to
the fullest of my capabili-
ties. I do not disagree with
the statement: 1 consider it
to be one‘of the best com.
ments yet made on the Vier
nam war.

‘However, if I were to sign
the statement. I would ser-
iously jeopardize the effec-
tiveness of another endeavor,
and the long-term § success
of that endeavor. I believe,
is too important to disre-
gard."

Trustee Committee Checks

Resolution
FACULTY RESOLUTION

“That Military Science at Davidson be made
elective, with the understanding that advanced
military science shall receive academic credit as
it does at the. present time, and with the fur-
ther recommendation that the Department of
Military Science at Davidson College, in cooper-
ation with the Dean of the Faculty ana Registrar,
attempt to modify the present form of its pro-
gram to permit entry into the full Military
Science program as late as possible.”

TRUSTEE ADDENDUM

“That the college affirm the importance of ~
the role of the ROTC in the life of many in-
dividual students, and affirm the importance of
the role of civilian, college-trained officers in
the military service of the country.

“One of the basic concepts of our country
has been the civilian army. The ROTC has been
a significant factor in maintaining this concept.
In a time when the military power of our nation
likely will be maintained at a high level, the of-
ficers produced by the ROTC constitutes a salu-
tary ingredient of ‘our national life.

“Therefore, the college should take appro-
priate steps to enable students to make a serious
and informal judgment concerning their partici-

pation in ROTC.

“Among the steps to be taken are: 1) a let-
ter be sent to the freshmen students and their
families in June prior to their enrollment: in
order that there may be family participation in
the decision; 2) a program be held in the orien-
tation period devoted to setting forth fully the
advantages and disadvantages to the student of
the ROTC program; 3) the student then be re-
quested to make his own decision as to his par
ticipation or non-participation in the ROTC.”

Student Opinion In Forum

By STEVE ROADY
Staff Writer

An overflow crowd cf stu-
dents, faculty members and
trustees participated in an
hour and a half ‘“‘Forum on
ROTC” last night in the
Morrison Room. ‘

Except for two brief state-
ments by faculty members
Dr. A. J. McKelway and
Col. Frederick B. Outlaw and
brief introductory and clos-
ing remarks by Dr. Warner
Hall, chairman of the trustee
Education Committee. tbe
forum consisted of a dialogue
among students concerning
the pros and cons of com-
pulsory ROTC.

Hall stated early in the
discussion that the trusive
Education Committee was
not present to debate the
ROTC issue but merely to
listen to various opinions on
the issue. A dialogue of sorts
then. developed between those
generally favoring the pre-
sent ROTC system anii those
who advocated a completely

voluntary program.

The arguments presented
fell into several broad
groups. Joe Norton and K.
D. Weeks. both seniors, tyni-
fied one group. which con-
tended that compulsory
ROTC is a good thing.

Junior Stagg Newman tovk
a moderate stand, saying
that he felt the present pro-
gram to be valuable, but
that he would support a vol-
untary program provided
that a period of objective
ROTC orientation be set up
for entering freshmen.

Those on the other side in-
cluded senior Sam Johnson
and junior Glenn Withrow,
Withrow stated ‘at 18 you are
mature enough to kill a man;
at 18 you ought to be ahle
to decide whether you are
going to take ROTC.”

In his talk. McKelway stat-
ed that ‘the faculty commit-

"tee dealing with ROTC estab.

lished -beyond question that
a voluntary program cou'd
survive at Davidson."’ He

On Program Participation

By DAVID SWEATT
Associate Editor

Davidson's Board of Trus
tees voted today to allow stu
dents to decide whether or
not they sill enroll in the
basic ROTC. ‘course.

The decision supplanted a
policy approved by the Board
little over. a year ago. That
policy, approved May 3. 1968.
restored a previous policy
which allowed a student ex
emption from the program
if requested by parents prior
to the student’s matricula
tion as a freshman.

The change passed to
day with an overwhelming
majority. ‘‘The best that |
could ‘heai."” commented
Board Chairman Walter L.
Lingle on ‘the voice vote,
“there was only one dissent-
ing vote.”

The trustees’ decision -re-
presented verbatim approval
of a faculty recommendation
voted on at the Tuesday
meeting of the faculty. The
trustees attached an addition
al statement, but its addition
in no way limits. the effect
of the policy .recommend ;
tion of the faculty.

The. new policy continues
the present policy of giving
academic credit for advanc
ed military science. The re
solution also calls on the De
partment of Military Science
to “‘atlempt to modify the
present form 0. its program
to permit entry ‘into the full
Military Science as late as
possible.”

Asked if the Board's de-
cision represented a change
in sentiment since last year,
Lingle responded, ‘I don’t
think the sentiment of the
Board was to keep compul-
sory ROTC. I think the senti-
ment of the: Board was to
have each family decide.
shall we say — the stu.
dent and the parents —
as to whether or not he
should, participate.

“Apparently it has turned
out to be unacceptable to the
students. That was the senti-
ment, in view, at the time.
The intent was one to estab-
lish permissiveness in this
respect, as opposed to a strict
policy.

“Actually.” concluded
Lingle,” I think there's been
a real element of surprise
on the part of the trustees

that more students didn’t
produce letters written by
parents."

The Board's action culmin-

ated a process of reconsider
ation that began in the fall
term when the SGA Senate
asked reconsideration of the

ROTC requirement. That
body resolved that ‘In rela
tion to the ideals of student
tnaturity and responsibility
as presented in the CRAP ‘re.
port, enrollment in the ROTC
program should be made vol.
untary.”"

The student committee for
voluntary ROTC presented
a resolution for voluntary
ROTC to the faculty's Edu-
cational Policy Committee
in January. The- EPC asked
the students to collect new
supporting information for
voluntary ROTC hefore re
turning to the EPC with their
resolution.

On March 14 the EPC con-
sented to student's requesis
that they be allowed to work
with interested faculty mem:
bers in collection of new in
formation, and EPC Chair-
man Dean. Frontis Johnston
was directed to bring the stu-
dent and faculty groups to
gether. $

This Student-Faculty Com:
mittee for Volunteer ROTC
presented its information to
the EPC in a two-hour meet-
ing on April 14. The informa-
tion included extract from
a survey of the American
Council on Education which
showed Davidson to be one
of sixteen private non Catho-
lic colleges and universities
in the nation still requiring
ROTC.

Trustees Raise
Catalogue Costs

A $300 increase in cata
logue costs, provision for us
ing endowment funds for op
erating expenses. and amend
ments to the Code of Respon
sibility were adopted by the
Board of Trustees today,
Trustee President Walter L.
Lingle Jr. dnnounced.

Possible change in struc-
ture of the Board was also
discussed, but no action was
taken pending report of the
Commission on Church Re-
lationship and the Academy.
for Educational Development,
Lingle said.

Dr, Spencer stated that
the five presidential com.
mission reports would be for
warded to the AED for eval.
uation and criticism soon as
they were completed, and he
hoped that they could be pre-
sented at the October trus-
tee meeting.

Total catalogue costs for
1969 70 will be $2685, Spen-
cer said. This includes a
$150 tuition increase from
$1540 to $1690. a $30 room
rent increase to $280. a $10
increase in laundry fees to
$110. and a $50 increase in
College Union board to $525.

Current total catalogue
costs are $2,385.

Spencer stated that there
would be an_ increase in
scholarships commensurate
with the increase in costs
and that athletic scholarship
funds would be increased in
order to maintain approxi-
mately the same number of
scholarships.

Spencer explained about a
rumor of scholarship reduc-
tion that future scholarships

rather than present scholar-
ships would be affected.

The College will have a
balanced budget for this
fiscal year, Spencer said in
his report'to the trustees.

A five-year ‘financial fore-
cast was also presented to
the Trustees, but Lingle em-
phasized that. the Trustees
felt the projections of future
expenditures were of limit.
ed value.

Spencer added. ‘‘These pro.
jections are not things to
which the College is com
mitted. but are simply an
attempt to look ahead and
say what it looks as if we're.
going to do and attempt to
plan in that direction.”

SGA President Peter Hob-
bie addressed the Trustees
this afternoon about adding

student members to the
Board.
The Trustees passed a

change in the by-laws en-
abling the Board to use en-
dowment capital for current
operating expenses. This wilt
enable the Gollege to invest
in growth ‘stocks with the
endowment rather than being
restricted to high-yield stocks,
Lingle explained.

However, expenditure of
endowment capital for cur-
rent expenses would have to
be approved by the Board in
each instance.

Action on two faculty ap-
pointments was postponed.

Approved changes in the
Code of Responsibility were
procedural ones recommend-
ed by the SGA and the facul-
ty.
