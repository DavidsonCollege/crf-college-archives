CLASS OF ‘67 FOOTBALLERS

Well, Bill Dole’s recruiting worries are over for
another year — he’s received confirmation from all of
his scholarship boys for next fall and from information
we've received the 1964 edition of the Davidson frosh
football squad should be a good one.

Speed and agility are the strong points in Dole’s
new crew. Most of his group of seventeen scholarship
boys were also sprinters in high school, and one of them,
Mickey Andrews from Greensboro, runs the 100 yard
dash in 10.2. Dole mentioned that Andrews and Johnny
Walker, a fullback from Laurens, S. C., were excellent

breakaway backs and should really help the squad in the
backfield.

One of the biggest catches for Dole this year was
the Hy of Jimmy Poole, North High's star quarter-
back. Dole considered Poole to have been “the best pass-
ing-running quarterback in Mecklenburg County last
year.” The only thing that may hurt Poole’s playing is
his size—he only weighs 155.

Another bright spot on the squad is punting, which
has plagued Dole in the past. Walker, George Jacobsen
from Greensboro, and Claude Owen from Danville, Va.,
should answer that problem, particularly Jacobsen, who’s
supposed to really be able to kill the pigskin.

The most noticeable difference between this and last
year’s frosh squad is the line size. There are no really big
boys this year, Gary Walman from Pittsburgh at 225, be-
ing the biggest. But Dole isn’t worried about this, saying,
"a — that the agility of the line will more than make up
for it.”

This year’s team also boasts no lack of backs which
hurt last year’s frosh. In all, it looks like a balanced and
speedy group, and they should turn in a good record at

Davidson.

“I don’t put too much stock
in the importance of that game
as an indicator of how we're
going to do,” said Coach Tom
Stevens. “I played it like an ex-
hibition game—I just wanted to
see what some of the new boys
could do and how sharp my re-
turnees were.”

“For instance. I could have
let Johnson go further (Sopho-
more Dave Johnson pitched two

New Fetzer Award
For Top Track Stars

Track Coach Heath Whittle
announced recently that a new
award, the Fetzer Award for
Excellence in Track, will be
given each year for the outstand-
ing performer on the track team.

Whittle explained that this
award will not be based on best
all-round performance in sev-
eral events, but will be awarded
to the boy who puts in the most
outstanding performances — in
any one event—like breaking
the school record or setting a
new conference record.

The winner of the award each
year will have his name en-
scribed on the trophy and will
also be presented with a plaque.
The trophy itself will be kept
in the trophy case outside of the
athletic office.

The trophy has been given in
honor of Robert A. and William
M. Fetzer, both outstanding ath-
letes and graduates of Davidson.
William Fetzer served as base-
ball coach here for years, and
Robert Fetzer was track coach
at the University of North Caro-
lina for many years and also
served as athletic director there.
He has retired from coaching
now and is head of the More-
head Scholarship Committee.

tial is here, but there hasn't
been time for it to come out.”

Despite the score there were
some bright spots in the David-
son nine. One was Johnson's
pitching. Another was the al-
most flawless fielding, especial-
ly by Tom Whitley, who handled
seven chances without an error,
and started a snappy double play

'Cat Netmen Face
U. of Michigan

This afternoon the Wildcat
netmen took on a strong Michi-
gan tennis squad in their third
match of the season. The ‘Cats
now have a 1-1 record.

as usual, professed to know lit-
tle about his opponents. “I think
that they finished third in the
big ten,” he said. Then he added,
“They have four indoor courts
and have been probably playing
all winter.”

On Monday the Cats opened
their season with a heartening
54 win over Kent State. Fogle-
man, happy over the win, said,
“You could almost call it an
upset.”

Although Kent State moved to
an early 2-0 lead the ’Cats mov-
ed back into contention and it
was anybody’s match down to
the final set of the last doubles
contest.

Following their victory over
Kent State, the netters suffered
a resounding 9-0 loss to George
Washington on Wednesday. The
match was never in doubt as the
overmatched ‘Cat netmen were
unable to chalk up a single vic-

tory.

Thinclads Open Season

In Meet Wednesday

The track team opens their spring season this com-
ing Wednesday with Catawba and Lenoir Rhyne. The
meet will be held at Richardson Stadium and will begin

at 3:30 p.m.

Alan Turner, a sophomore
from Greensboro, will lead the
‘Cats in the sprints. In the
Southern Conference Indoor
Track meet held earlier this
year, Turner finished second in
the 60-yard dash and was good
for a fourth in the 70-yard low
hurdles.

He will be ably assisted out-
doors by senior Bob Cordle in
the 100 and 220-yard dashes.

Sterling Martin will be out

to break his school record of
9:39 for the 2-mile run, which
he set in the ACC indoor meet
two weeks ago. Martin will be
backed up in the distance events
by Tommy Heffner, Denny Phil-
lips, and Ronnie Reese.

Lenoir Rhyne is supposed to
have a good team while Cataw-
ba is an unknown quantity. Ac-
cording to Whittle, the meet
will be a real battle.

and

Washington once again 17-10.
Low man for the team was Mims
Rogers, Senior from Florence,
Alabama, with a 77. Jim Cooper
took Ross's place in this match.

With this match, Davidson
closed out Southern Conference
action until May 7-8, when the
‘Cats will host the Conference
tournament at the Dunes.

The next match for the golfers
will be with N.C. State in Ra-

Tuesday. Bob Bost wil! join the
team on this trip.

With the fine play of four
sophomores, Ross, McClelland,
Romoda, and Cooper, the David-
son College Golf team is look-
ing forward to a successful sea-
son this year and a possible SC
title. Also, Senior Haywood
Evans will add strength to the
golfers when he joins the team
soon.
