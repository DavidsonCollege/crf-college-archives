Are You Shattered?

Jackie, SHABRAUSKI, Farewell

Davidson has this year suf-
fered a loss more terrible than
words can describe. Cosmetic
refinements such as improved
lighting, Baker Sports Complexes
and new police-dude uniforms fail

to hide the bitter emptiness that
pervades our tree-lined avenues
and red brick structures. Indeed,
blessed are the men and women of
the class of 1991, who will be
painfully aware of this loss for
only their final semester. But for
those few readers who know notof
the deprivation I lament, let me
explain.

Since my first year at Davidson,
the reeling athletic program here
has had but one solid pillar on
which to lean for support. ;

It’s not some crusty old trusty,
Nor is it even a charismatic leader
among students and avid sports
fans like myself.

No, friends, this one founda-
tion has been a mysterious figure
in Davidson lore, known to many
as “the shattered dude,” but lov-
ingly remembered by some of. us
as the Last American Sweatjam-
mer - Jackie.

Who among us has not heard
The Lingo, that beautiful exchange
of mutual concern and universal
harmony? Who has not been ex-
posed to the joys of real down-
home North Carolina sweatjam-
ming? Only the terribly unfortu-
nate who have failed tocross paths
with Him.

I can remember my first en-
counter with Jackie as though it

ABRAUSKI. That Means We’re
All Shattered.”

Okay. Shabrauski.

“Now You Know The Lingo.”

Cool. Thanks. GO CATS!!!

“Do You Know WhatIt Means
To Be Shattered?”

Uh... nope.

“Tt Means You’re Having A
Good Time.”

Okay, I get it. Thanks.

This one foundation has been a mysterious figure
in Davidson lore ... lovingly remembered by some
of us as the Last American Sweatjammer -Jackie.

were only yesterday. It was ata
soccer game in the fall of my

freshperson year, in the second half;

three minutes and forty seconds
left, with the Wildcats winning one
to nothing. I was wearing my new
Mickey Mouse boxers with some
old Duckheads, and had my well-
worn T-shirt wrapped around my
head. From out of nowhere he
appeared, and inquired of me: “Are
You Shattered?”

Huh, dude?

“Do You Know The Lingo?”

Uh, sure dude. Whatever. GO
CATS!!!

“Are You Shattered, Then?”

Yeah, sure.

“NO! You’ re Supposed To Say
SHADOOBEE.”...

What?

“If You’re Shattered, Then
You Say SHADOOBIE.”

Heh Heh. Okay buddy, you
first. '

“Are You Shattered?”

Shadoobie.

“KAYOBEE!”

What the hell .:.?

“That Means That I’m Shat-
tered Too.”

Ooohhhhhh.

“Now You Say: SH-

“Ym Going To Do Some
Sweatjamming Now.”

Okay dude. Later.

How young and foolish I was
then. How little Iknew. But fate
led me to meet Jackie again and
again.

Eventually I could speak The
Lingo like anative, leammed how to
Sweatjam, and had seen Jackie’s
book about the guy that made a
guitar out of a Mate’s Chair. I was
blessed.

But sadly enough, the coming
generations of Davidson students
won’t have Jackie to light their
paths for them. Jackie has moved
away. Some rumors say he’s gone
to Oregon; others, to Maine.
Wherever heis, I know he’s spread-
ing his message of hope to some
liberal arts students there, creating
a small bastion of sanity in this
crazy world.

Oh, Jackie, what a great life it
would be if Iraqis and Americans,
Armenians and Turks, Palestini-
ans and Jews, and even Queens
Women and Davidson Women
could gather together at a soccer
game, crank up their Walkmans,
and all shout in glorious harmony,
“SHABRAUSKI!!!”

this: that no peace without the
consent of the governed will last.
For part of the blame for the rise of
fascism in Germany should go to
the injustices imposed by the Al-
lies in the Treaty of Versailles.
After parcelling off its territories
and insisting that it demilitarize,
the Allies required Germany to
pay exorbitant reparations. Partly
as a result of these harsh terms,
German resentment against the rest
ofEurope grew, and Hitler’s power
fed on that resentment with ter-
rible repercussions for Europe.

That’ same Treaty of
Verasailles holds much of the
blame for the mess on our hands
today. In order to secure assis-
tance against the Ottoman Empire,
European leaders offered certain
things to an Arab army which
eventually captured an area stretch-
ing north from Aqaba almostas far
as Turkey and going inland from
the Mediterranean to Damascus.
They had promised complete Arab
independence in the captured area
and governmentby consentinother
regions once ruled by the Ottoman
Empire, and yet the peacemakers
ignored their promises and par-
celled the land between the two
imperial powers, Britain and
France.

Thus a newround of western
meddling in the Arab world began.

Outraged, the disposessed
army began to raid British and
French establishments; in Iraq,
Britain retaliated by burning vil-
lages, and ‘when a popular Arab
leader arose in Iraq, the British ab-
ducted him and sent him to Cey-
lon. -
Together the French and Brit-

ish established friendly govern-
ments in their territories and bought
off the rest of the region’s rulers.
In the end, the Arab world had
once more lost its sovreignty and
yetthe world once more ignored it.
So if George Bush wants to learn a
lesson from 1939 let him realize
this: in Germany the treaty of
Verailles helped spawn a dictator
who threatened all of Europe; in
the Mid-East the same treaty has
helped spawn more than one dicta-
tor as well as a smoldering resent-
ment the strength of which has in
the ‘past and will in the future
threaten the stability for which our
soldiers are fighting.

This, then, is the main reason I
oppose our war with Iraq: I doubt
that we can ever hope to create a
lasting peace while we maintain an
alien status quo. Because of this I
must advocate a peaceful solution
to this conflict rather than the vio-
lent one we have embarked upon.
Forour attempt to impose one more
new order from without can only
foster more resentment, spawn
more violence, and eventually
render futile the sacrifice of so
many Americans who have been
led to believe that their efforts will
create a lasting peace in the Middle
East. Yes, I think the war should
end as soon as possible, and I cer-
tainly hope for the troops’ sake we
end it quickly. Nevertheless, land
many other protesters also feel that
even a quick victory will only
prolong a far deeper conflict.

United States used its security
council veto 36 times; the Soviet
Union, by contrast, used its veto
only twice. In 1986, the Interna-
tional Court of Justice found the
United States guilty of aggression,

State terrorism, and other viola-
tions of international law in its
actions toward Nicaragua; the U.S.
responded by refusing to uphold
the Court’s decisions for the next
two years.

In recent years the U.S. has

continued to oppose a number of
nearly unanimous votesin the U.N.:

Opinions
You have them.
‘ We want them.

Read The Davidsonian, The South's Foremost College Weekly
and say, "The world is a really big place, I mean, look at how far
away that tree is," or,"Old MacDonald had a farm," or, "We
should have let sanctions work," or, "we should nuke everything
that is evil and not like us,” or, "Look, JC Penny's is having a
sale," or, "Jesus loves me this I know," or whatever, and write it
down ina letter and send the letter to The Davidsonian office and
french fries and a large coke and if you have any questions or

‘comments call Dave Scott at x6615. He wants to help you.

the United States vetoed a 14-1
Security council resolution con-
demning Israel for brutally sup-
pressing resistance in the Occu-
pied Territories in Palestine. In
December of the same year, the
U.S. and Israel were the only two
countries that opposed the General
Assembly’s vote to condemn the
U.S. embargo of Nicaragua.

This does not mean that I think
the United States is an evil coun-
try, or that we are wrong to oppose
Hussein. It does mean that the
United States, while quick to con-
demn others’ wrongdoing, is often
itself guilty of supporting violence
and injustice.

In this particular situation, the
international community stands
behind us. But when our own
interests conflict with world opin-

ion, we are perfectly willing to ©

defy it. When we ourselves do not
possess the maturity to respond to
unanimous world opinion, how can
we expectother countries to do the
same?

So what should we do? Iam not

Saying we should avoid world

politics altogether, or that we
should letactions like Hussein’ s
gounpunished. Iam saying that
we should intervene in world
affairs only to the extent that in-
tervention will be effective.
President Bush believes that
intervention in Iraq will lead to
a New World Order of peace
and prosperity, and that these
spectacular results justify ahuge
loss of dollars and lives. Yet it
seems unlikely that the war will
accomplish any of this. Would
itnothave been better simply to
let sanctions continue to work?

Bush has decided to go to
war, and it looks like he will not
stop the war now that it has
started. I doubt that the war
will, in the end, lead to any’
lasting peace or stability in the

region. Butour failure may lead

us tO reassess our policy in the
Middle East and elsewhere.
When the next crisis comes, we
may be more willing to address
the true issues of conflict, and
less willing to establish an arti-
ficial order through force. When

the United States begins to pursue
real and equitable solutions 10
worldconflict - then, and only then,
can a true New World Order be es-
tablished.
