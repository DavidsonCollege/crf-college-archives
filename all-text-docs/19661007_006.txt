RACISM CAUSES OPPOSITION
Maddox Nomination Upsets Georgia Students

r By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

“I think I'll move to North
Carolina if Lester Maddox is
elected governor of Georgia.”
commented Julian Prosser, a
junior from Gainesville, Ga.

Prosser, extremely opposed
to Maddox in next month's
Georgia gubernatorial election,
recently decided to start a pe-
tition among Davidson Georgi-
ans to support Jimmy Carter
as a write-in candidate for

Democratic primary, trailing
Ellis Arnall by 5,000 votes.

Prosser, however, has decid-
ed not to circulate this peti-
tion because Carter might get
the Democratic votes which
would be cast otherwise for the
Republican candidate, Howard
(Bo) Callaway.

A Democrat himself, Pros-
ser is opposed to Maddox be-
cause he jis ‘‘a racist and an
extremist. who doesn't project
an image of sanity. He would
bluff his way through the gov-

demands on the federal gov-
ernment," continued Prosser.
According to Prosser, Calla-
way “takes a middle-of-the.
road conservative view, makes
a good personal appearance.
is a good speaker, but has no
real positive proposals to im
prove the state of Georgia.”
“It seems a shame," sa.d
Prosser, “‘to have such poor
candidates after Georgia has
made so much progress in the
last four years under Gov.
Carl Sanders, who has made

state. He is a progressive lib-

eral who has made especially
great strides in the field of
education.”

Although Prosser realizes
that the Democrats in high po
sitions will have to support
Maddox, he feels that many in
dividual Democrats will vote
for Callaway. In fact, he plans
possibly to send a petition
signed by Georgia students
from Davidson to Callaway en.
dorsing him as “the most com.
petent candidate."

are in even worse’ shape than

politics are in shambles.”’ said

switched to the Republican
party during Goldwater's cam

According to. him, the term

party split into two factions,
one led by John Quincy Adams,
the other by Andrew Jackson,
which were known as the De-

National Republicans.

To avoid confusion, the Na-
