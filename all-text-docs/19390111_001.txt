The graduation exercises will take
place on Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday, June 3, 4, and 5 this year
instead Sunday, Monday, and
Tuesday as in the past. This alter-
ation, made swith the approval of
the Faculty, the Trustees, and the
Alumni Council, will probably be
received favorably by the seniors,
since in the past they have had to
spend Monday in idleness while
waiting for their diplomas to be
awarded on Tuesday. This means
that Alumni Day, formerly held on
Monday, will be on Saturday this
year.

The commencement program for
1939 is as follows: Friday, June 2,
10:00 a. m., Meeting of the Trus-
tees, 4 p. m., Exeéutive Committee,
Alumni Council; 8 p. Alumni

Beavers Wait
To Have Hunt

Wednesday morning after chapel,
the Beaver club held a brief meet-
ing and to the
planned ’possum hunt, which would
conflict with the basketball game
scheduled for Saturday night.

Much enthusiasm had been work-
ed up over the prospective hunt,
so Buck Powell states that it will
be held after the semester exami-
nations. The hunt will be held at
“the rocks,” and hay wagons will
be used as transportation to that
spot.

Club to Give Opera

The Red and Black Masquers,
in cooperation with the music
department, are making plans to
Reginald de Koven’s
comic opera “Robin Hood” as a

present

part of the commencement exer-
cises this year. As nothing de-
finite has been decided, no an-
nouncements as to the methods
of try-outs can be made but the
Masquers will announce more
definite plans later.

The opera is a popular one in
three acts and includes such well
“O!

Me.”

The Red and Back Masquers
also plan to give a three act play
in March. The one to be given
has not been selected and the
members of the organization are
anxious to get any suggestions
which students may have as to
some plays which they may par-
