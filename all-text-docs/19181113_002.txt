down for an OL VC.) we'll know the
reason why,

Ie's true, there have been cases where
men, who were pour students, have easily
received their commissions; and also
where men. who habitually knock dawn
erades close to the hundred mark. have
den repatedly turned dowa; yet that
daesi’t mean everyone can do the same.
It’s neither the “shark” nor the loater
who gets anvavhere: it's the | common

hard to study, but a litthe work now and

“AND YET THE

MALL KON VANDALS,

The present mail delivery system for
the campus is asplendid thing. It is not
any convenient, but keeps the fellows
from running down to the postoffice at
the whistle of every train, “The bos
with lettered pigeon hdles at the entranee
af Georgia is opencto all, and theretore
atthe mercy of anyone desiring te ran
sack: its contents. No letrers have been
tnissed, but newspapers and periodicals
are continually being remaved by non-
oweers, Hoa man is not on the spot
when the mail is put up. his Observer
vanishes, and no one knows a thing about
it, One fellow subscribing to this pa
per, hasn't been able to get his copy for
aoweek. Ot course these papers and
periodicals are aot “stolen” in that sense
of the word, but are removed thru thot
lessness and not returned to the bon.
Rat, fellows, in the eves of the law it is
a serious offense, the penalty a fine up in
fotir Higures or acrather uncomfortable
penitentiary term: so in addition to con-
sidering the fact that atman who sub-
scribes to x paper would dike to, see it
himself once ina while, let's think of
ourselves and take only our own mail
trom the box, unless we intend taking it
to the owner.

Are we going to get passes to Winston
Saturday? “hat remains to be seen.
Hfowever, we have only two alternatives:
if we pet passes, every man in the Da-
videan S.A. TT. C., who is not financially
detunct. should be at that field in Win-
ston and show Carolina a scrap that she
won't torget. Li we don't get passes,
we should give the team the kind of send

WAR IS OVER”

It ought not to be necessary to tell
some fellows that it is a most serious of-
fense to pot arifle at anyone,

Among the thousand and one rimors
roaming about the campus these davs.
seeing, alone is believing.

It’s lack of etiquette not to write on
hoth sides of VY. Mi. C. A. stationery
these days.

Some fellows persist in’ holding up
their hands on class. You're at college
now, not a prep school,

The United War Work Campaign—
are vou doing the square thing by it?

S. A.V. C. still stands for some of us:
“Stick Around ‘The Campus.”

Maybe our uniforms will be Uncle
Sam's Christmas presents to us.
———
No, Generals, it can't be “did.” We're
caldiers too, now.

“Whoever invests St.000 in War Sav
ings Stamps helps to win the war to the
extent that he sustains a soldier a vear
and five months, or he provides full per-
sonal equipment for nearly four soldiers.
or he transports cight men to France, or
he mects the expenses of over two men
in the army for a vear. Whoever buys
St.oco in War Savings Stamps provides
averseas clothing equipment for ten men
or fighting equipment such as rifles, baye-
nets, cartridges, etv.. tor fifteen men.
Whoever invests $1,000 in War Sav-
ings Stamps buys eight automatic rifles—
small Browning machine guns, or-20.000
rifle cartridges. or 2.000 hand grenades.
cr five cavalry horses, one field kitchen
one loaded sixteen-inch shell. cighty
three-inch high explosive shells, one smal!
wireless outfit. or maintain the whole

|war cost of the country for just two

seconds.”

Private Buck declares himselt a pyr-
manent bankrupt. He had but $15 com-
ing to him in October. out of which
$32.60 was deducted.
