A new shopping center will
open in Davidson in mid-De-
cember, according to Louis Fein
of Shamrock Realty. It will be
located off Griffith Street be-
tween Railroad and Watson
Streets.
Fein said that the opening of
six businesses in the center
“will hopefully take place before
the Christmas holidays.”
Three businesses— Lowe’s

‘Supermarket, Cornwell’s Drug- .

store, and Havelos’ Family

fle Restaurant—have already —

leases to occupy the

- shopping center. ‘According to

Fein, the other three vacancies 2

might be filled by a gift shop, a
record store, a hair styling
shop, or “anything that would
complement the college.”’

Will Terry decided to. suspend
the athlete for this fall term.
The athlete appealed to the
Review Board, however, and
was granted the’ postponement.

Had Terry's original sentence
stood, the athlete would have
missed his sport’s season for
this year.

Schuh said that the letter will
attempt to give the Review
Board's reasons for its decision
to postpone the sentence. He
' stressed that the letter will not
contain the specifics of the case,

violations. Also, the certainty
of long suspension could make
the Honor Council hesitant to
convict violators and make
violators hesitant to confess:

Terry said he will rework his
proposal. with the SCC if it

Fein unked that both the
supermarket and drug store are
parts of regional chains. The
restaurant, however,’ is a local
business owned by a Charlotte
family. Fein said that it will be
a “family style, sit-down res-
taurant with tablecloths, not at
all like a fast food place.’

Davidson Mayor Nancy Mac-
Cormac said that the communi-
ty reaction will not be known
until ‘‘the citizens have seen
what is’ on the shelves of the
stores."’ However, she added,
“There has been a desire and an
interest in having a grocery
store in town for quite a while.”

MacCormac added that Da-
vidson town leaders hopé the
shopping center will tie in with
proposed downtown devel-
opment.

Review Board———

including the athlete’s name.
He said,“We feel that this
issue must be brought out, but
we must respect the individual’ s
right to privacy.’

Schuh declined comment on
the original decision except to
say that the Review Board
“acted totally within the Code.”

Schuh said that althouhg he
could not be certain, “I think
the Executive Committee was
satisfied with our explanation of
the decision.” College

President Samuel Spencer, also —

Chairman of the Committee,
said only,” The Executive Com-
‘mittee took no action and has
no comment.”’All other faculty

. and administrators contacted
