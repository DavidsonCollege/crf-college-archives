John Munce was elected
SGA president, and 12 other
positions were filled in the
Tuesday SGA elections and
Wednesday run-offs according
to SGA Chancellor Brad
Swalwell.

Munce: won the presidency
by a margin of 111 votes over
contender Rick Roylance with
725 votes cast.

“My immediate concerns
will be to conclude work on the
bill of rights and student by-
laws, to organize the SGA, fill
positions on the SEC, organize
the Senate working com-
mittees, meet with the Y

president, Union Board
president, and DAVID-
SONIAN editor, and to

inaugurate new programs,
setting the tone for the whole
new year,” said Munce.

Lynne Keener won the race
for SGA vice-president by an
18 vote margin over Marc
Menchell in the Wednesday
run-offs.

“T look upon the real func-
tion of the vice-president as
chairing the Residence Hall
Council,” said Keener.

‘The main problem with the
residence Hall Council is that
the student body doesn’t un-
derstand. it’s there to help
them’’, Keener added.

She indicated that major im-
mediate concerns included the
dormitory mailboxes and
identification of campus dogs.

Randy Hunter was elected
Quips and Cranks editor by a
wide margin. Hunter in-
dicated that more special af-
fects and different forms of
photography would be used in
the 75-76 yearbook than have
been used in past years.

“The 73-74 effort wasn’t a
very exciting annual, but it
wasn’t that bad; it just wasn’t
impressive,” Hunter added.

“George may have gone a
little overboard with his
critical philosophy. It may
have been too much of his per-
sonal opinion; what we need is
more of an overview of the

year.”
Concerning censorship,
Hunter said, ‘‘What Jeff

but it was a mistake for the ad-
ministration to censor it, even
though it was in their pwer.’’

Sue Cunningham was elec-
ted YMWCA president with
64% of the vote. She stressed
the need for more student
volunteers in Y programs.

“I’m hoping to initiate new
programs including the star-
‘ting of a food co-op for the
churches in this area. What we
need are students to do the
footwork to set it up’’, said
Cunningham.

Recently elected Union
Board President ‘Richard
Wassen indicated his plans to
‘insure quick construction of
the new union while maintain—
ing a good program in the
present union facility.

predominance of jazz in the
Union programs.

“We need to remove the em-
phasis on the “big weekend,”
Activities must be planned so
there will be something every
weekend,’’ Menchel said.
However, he stressed that in-
creased entertainment should
be at the cost of big weekends.

Bob Earnest and John
McArthur were elected Wild-
cat Handbook editors, tallying
95 votes more than did their
opposition, John Swanson and
Bob Westmoreland.

“Our major goal is going to
be to get the Wildcat Hand-
book to the class of ’79 this
summer, before they arrive at
Davidson,”’ said McArthur.

comments were “conjectural
and tentative,’’ Williams said
that he may _ slightly
reorganize the Development
Office to include a department
concerned with corporations
and foundations which have
given or- might give to the
College.

He feels that a program to
elicit corporate support for
Davidson should be a major
concern of the Development
Office.

Williams does not feel that
the Development Office’s ef-
forts should be looked upon as
an isolated facet of the
College. He sees the office as
an integral part of the com-
munity, concerned with
‘‘development of un-
derstanding, _ participation,
and support for the college by
its various constituents.”

Former Vice-President for
Development C. David Cornell
made several gloomy predic-
tions about Davidson’s finan-
cial security over the next few
fiscal years when he left the
college. These included a war-
ning that the endowment must
be increased or expenses cut if
Davidson is to survive another
two years without ‘‘being
down by as much as $1,000,00
in ‘76.”’

Williams concurred for the
most part with Cornell, saying
that, as most of the major
economists predict “a third
consecutive year of -dquble-

digit inflation,” be saw. ng in-

dication that Davidson will hot **

need substantially greater
funds.

“If Davidson is to con-
tinue...offering the program it
has and the financial aid and
the faculty salaries it has it
will need to anticipate a 15
percent increase in operating
funds,”’ he said, adding that
this only applied to fiscal year
1975 and that the inflationary
trend boded no better times
further on.

Williams feels, like Cornell,
that an increased endowment-
building program will provide
an answer, along with in-
creased gifts. The trustees
have frozen tuition for the next
two years and he would like to
see ‘‘fee increase kept to a
minimum” so an increased
tuition probably will not
result.

Nevertheless, the Office of
Development must produce 15
percent more money this
fiscal year. If Williams finds
that his office cannot raise the
funds, he will look to cut ad-
ministration expenditures fir-
st.

Williams has been at Mary
Baldwin College for seven
years. He accepted his post at
Davidson because he felt the
position would be enjoyable
worthwhile. He indicated that
he looks forward to working
with a school which ‘has con-
tributed to higher education”
and has ‘‘the sense of purpose
and close, unembarrassed,
ties with the church that
