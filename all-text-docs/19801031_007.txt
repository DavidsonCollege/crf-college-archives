Wolfe's story in Look Homeward, Angel relevant to college students

By JEAN SORACCO

“She managed to take the
book, massive and sprawling,
and structure it into a fine
theater piece within the confines
of theater structure,”” commen-
ted Theatre Professor Rupert

Barber on Ketti Frings’ stage
version of Thomas Wolfe’s Look
Homeward, Angel.

Barber is directing the Col-
lege production of the play set
to open Thursday, October 30
at 7:30 in Hodson Hall.

The play focuses. more on the
Gant family than the novel
which focuses on both the
community and the family. The
theme of the play involves the
young man, Eugene, breaking
away from his family to go to
college.

“‘T have found the theme
exciting to work with because it
relates so closely with the
college age student,’’ Barber
said. ‘“‘So many plays are not
relevant to college students, but
this one is identifiable.’’

For those unfamiliar with the
novel, it follows Thomas
Wolfe’s life from childhood

through his college years. Bar--
ber feels that Look Homeward,

Angel is not ‘‘Completely auto-
biographical, but it is certainly
based on true characters and
events.”’

“The novel is good because of
the language and the charac-
ters,’ Barber said, ‘‘but this
does not hold on stage. Frings
has created a theater piece
capturing the essence of the
- novel. Wolfe initially viewed

Robert Postma sat in Cham-
bers gallery with his exhibit of
nine paintings representing a
span of his artistic career from
1969 to 1980. He began by
saying that he did not want to
talk in front of his work. The
voice, like the man, was timid
and quiet: one has to listen
carefully and Postma seemed to
like it that way.
The balding figure did not

possess the physical eccen-.

tricities of an artist, but appear-
ed more like a man whose face
you would not remember. He
wore a tie and leisure suit
jacket, part of his composed

middle American image. But

his tennis shoes didn’t fit that
image, hinting at his unique-

The venting (maybe too.
strong a word for a quiet man):
of that uniqueness is.this man’s
art. Postma, even under direct
questioning, would not discuss
his work or views in Chambers.
He did not exchange ideas, but
delivered a composed impene-
trable monologue about his life.

Postma was willing to talk
about how he came to be an
abstract artist. Even after a
mail order art course, he claim-
ed his artistic thoughts were
naive. He thought abstract

himself as a playwright and

studied to be one. I think that
he would be pleased with the
play.”’

Barber and Theater Professor
Joseph Gardner have designed
the play with memory as the
idea behind the play. ‘‘Memory
involves the pulling of bits and
pieces back into the mind,” said
Barber. Gardner feels that
“Wolfe was reflecting upon his
youth when he wrote his novel.”’.

Emphasizing memory pres-

ented a challenge to Dr. Gard-
ner in designing the set. The set
must correspond to the frag-
mentary nature of memory us-
ing ‘‘quite detailed parts that
are pieces of a whole.’’ Gardner
added, “It’s like a mosaic with
missing pieces.”’

The play covers the three
weeks before Eugene leaves for
college. Most of the scenes take
place at his mother’s boarding
house which is a large, elaborate

setting involving three bed-

rooms, a hall, the veranda and
backyard. There is also a scene
inside his father’s marble shop.

The lighting has several func-
tions: focus, mood and empha-
sis. All of the scene changes are
done with lighting. In conjunc-
tion with the memory idea, the
lighting will not be realistic.

Light will focus on the statue of .

the angel which will be onstage
throughout the entire perfor-
mance.

appearance belies abstract paintings

painting sleazy, quick, and -

superfical. His real education
began in the museum where he
found old masters, impresssion-
ists, and modern works. Now
not concerned with his con-
temporaries, he claimed the
museum artists as being those
with whom he would compete.

Postma finally found his art
form, abstract painting. He
dated his last image painting as
20 years ago this November.

The title of this exhibition,
Robert Postma: Large Paint-
ings 1969-1980, suggests a
transition over time. The first
painting, dating from 1969, is a
large canvas with vertical bands
of intense uniform color. This
work is clearly an uninspiring
beginning, a start from which to
judge Postma’s artistic trans-
ition. —

The next three canvases,
dating from 1975-77 (what he
painted in the preceeding six
years is unknown to us), pre-
sent a new format:arrange-
ments of precise sharp triangles
rendered in a range of color
extended to include toned
down, lighter hues. The tri-
angles.of which these pieces are
composed vary both in size and
acuteness of their angles. This
variety creates a total frag-
mentation of forms and a cas-

cading crystal sharpness in .,
composition

The space between the tri-

angles, no matter how minute,
is most important in these
paintings. The handling of that
space determines. the ‘effective-
ness of the transitions between
the triangles. Here, the forms
are delineated by the thin white
strips of unpainted canvas, the
result of the hard-edged tech-
nique. Postma has failed to deal
with this transition. In a few
places, he does add weak and
timid lines of color.

and color show the removal of
any evidence of the artist's
hand, which contributes greatly
to the works’ sharpness.

ing his creative process. He now:

necessary for theater,’’ Gardner
said. In Look Homeward, An-
gel the metaphor happens to be
given in the title. ‘The angel, a
very rich metaphor, helps pro-
vide focus for what is being
stated in the play,’’ he added.
“The angel symbolized the po-
tential, the possibility and the
hope that exists in the world
outside the boarding house.”
The cast represents a mixture
of newcomers and veterans to

. the stage, from freshmen to

seniors. The preparation of the
cast has been extensive. ‘‘I
encouraged each member of the
cast to read the sections of the
novel pertaining to the play,”
Barber said. “Some have read
the entire novel and others have
delved into their characters by
reading other Wolfe novels.”
‘The cast visited Asheville to

‘gee the actual boarding house—

{presently a Thomas Wolfe
memorial), Wolfe’s grave and
the site of the angel.-+ Dr.
William Cumming spoke with
the cast about a meeting that he
had with Wolfe’s mother and
sister.

Sue Ross, a Wolfe enthusiast,’
talked with some cast members
about the relationship between
the novel characters, the play
characters, and the real char-
acters. Barber feels that it
becomes ‘‘increasingly difficult
to separate the novel from the
play from the true story; the
three are blended so well to-
gether.”’

Eighty students are involved
in the production. The prop
committee has been particularly
challenged in finding 1916-type
props, Barber said. ‘‘Also, all of
the marble works inside the
shop had to be made.”

In addition to the student
opening Thursday night, there
will be two performances on
Friday at 5:00 and 8:30, and one -
on Saturday at 8:00. There will
be three performances next
week at 7:30 on Thursday,
November 6, and at 8:00 on
November 7 and 8.
