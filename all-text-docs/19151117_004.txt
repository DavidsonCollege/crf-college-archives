Varsity Basket Ball
Practice Begins

Good Material Among New Men—
Fresh Win From Seniors.

Goach Kluttz iss now holding basket
ball practice two or three nights a week
to work the kinks out of those men of
last vear’s squad who are not out for
foot ball and also to look over some of
the class players. Most of the State
quintettes have already begun limbering
up. Carolina and A. & M. began No-
vember 1, and Trinity, Guilford and
Elon, since they do not have foot ball,
practice all Fall. Tt is hoped that due to
this carly practice that about two games
can he scheduled before Christmas,
Trinity probably being Davidson's op-
ponent in one of these. With Henge-
veldt. Childs, Walker, Reese, Laird,
Wood and Carson, of last year’s squad,
together with the new material, some
of which is very promising, Davidson
should put out a very formidable team.

Tom Hill, manager, is working hard
on his schedule, but will not be able to
give anything out definitely for a week
or so.

CLASS GAMR.

Possihly the most exciting and cer-
tainly the most evenly contested game
of the season was played last Thursday
when the Freshmen defeated the Seniors
21-17. The scores went up evenly till
at the end of the second half they were
17-17. Five minutes longer was given
to plav off the tie when Williamson and
Nimocks each shot a goal for the Fresh-
men, and Dumas failed to. shoot a foul
for the Seniors.

For the Freshmen, Nimocks and Mc-
Askill, and for the Seniors, Perry and
Hovt, played especially well.

The line-up was as follows:

Seniors (17) Position Freshmen (21)

Perry.......-. Forward. .. . Nimocks
Hoyt.......... Forward... ....Hall
Dumas. .......- Center . . Williamson
Patton.......-- Guard ... . McAskill
Edgerton.......Guard ....... Potts

Y. M. C. A. MEETING.

Last Thursday night W. A. Dumas
spoke to the Y. M. C. A. on “The
College Hero.” An outline of his talk
follows: It is good for a man to have
heroes and examples and models. There
are collegiate heroes as well as national
heroes. All look up to great athletes,
but when a student becomes a Junior or
a Senior he realizes that the men work-
ing for the college in a literary way,
editing or managing the various publica-
tions of the colleges, are heroes as well
as the athletes. Another class of heroes
are those who stand out from the crowd
and oppose the crowd, if necessary, on a
question of right and wrong. Those
who do the right thing and live the
right kind of life in the face of ridicule
are truly great and are heroes. He
urged a life of positive Christianity that
would show its colors without the ask-
ing. In closing he pointed out Christ.
the greatest of all heroes, as the true pat-
tern for our lives.

(Concluded from page 1)

Donald and Parker were again called on
to carry the ball and made a total of 35
yards, the former going over for the
touchdown. ‘Tayloe kicked out to
Parker, who fumbled, and so no goal
was kicked. After Gray had kicked to
the Carolina 30-yard line and Tayloe
had failed to gain, Long punted 40
yards to Lawson, who was downed by
Cowell after 7 yards. On the next play
the ball was fumbled and Tayloe re-
covered. A pass, Long to Parker, was
grounded and Long punted 40 yards to
Lawson, who signalled for a_ fair
catch. Two passes, Lawson to Young-
er and Walker, were broken up and
after Black had gained 9 yards the ball
was punted 40 yards to Long, who ran
60 yards through a broken field for a
touchdown. Tandy kicked goal. After
an exchange of punts and gains by Laird
and Black. the latter went over the line
for Davidson’s only touchdown. A try
for goal failed. The score at this point
was 41-6, and very few gains were made
after this until the quarter ended with
the ball in Carolina’s possession on her
own 20-yard line.

At the conclusion of the game the
Davidson students, 200 strong, who had
gone up on a special train in the morn-
ing. though of course disheartened by
their defeat. marched back to the main
