Pan-Hellenic Petition Approv-|
ed By Committee In Meet-
ing Yesterday

ENDS PERTINENT ISSUE.

Two Sets To Be Given Each
Semester

The faculty committee, in a
meeting at 4:30_ yesterday,|
passed the petition presented
to them by the Pan-Hellenic,
Council. The granted petition
asked for four dance sets in-
cluding two night dances per
set during the coming year, in-
stead of two full sets and two.
one-night dancés.
ulty ruling marks the close of.
the dance question which has
been a most pertinent one on:
the campus for some time.

This petition was_passed_
the understanding that these dances '
shall constitute the complete dance
program of the year. This ruling
does not affect the previously made
rule about fraternity houwstparties.

Home-Coming Set

Since the petition was passed the~

Homecoming dances on November
5 and 6 will be the first of the two
set dances to be given this semes-
ter, The Midwinters set will be
the first two night set of the sec-
ond semester. The time for the:
other two has not yet been de-
cided definitely. —

The dance situation has been of
great. interest to the students and
faculty alike during the month;
that it had been undecided and the
decision is the culmination of this
much discussed question. The pe-
tition was compiled by the coun-
cil and presented to the exccutive
committee who referred it. to the
faculty committee who have passed
it. The council had in mind in
presenting the petition the obtain-
ing of a more lenient ruling on the
situation,

Fire! Fire! No it wasn't. femi-

College Inn, formerly the David-;
son Hotel, was partially damaged :
by fire carly last Saturday morn.,
ing. The meat market and the gro-
cery store adjoining the Inn were:
completely — demolished by the
flames while quick work by jire-
men and others limited the great-
est part of the Inn's detriment to.
the north side of the hotel.

The fire was discovered by an. transfer students, a problem which ¢

occupant of a northside room in the
Inn when he awoke to find flam-|
ing curtains blowing across his bed.,
The alarm was immediately given
and the local firefighters summon-,
ed. When the size of the blaze
was ascertained the Mooresville
Fire Department was also called in.
The cause of the flames is as yet
unknown, and it is thought that the
blaze was discovered some time
after it began.

The chief damage to the hotel
was the room which was burnt.
Other parts_of the_establishment
suffered loss from water and
smoke. The dining room, which
received quite a bit of injury, will
be remodeled, according to the
management. |

Professor Blythe, Dr. Foreman
and Professor Theis, of the David-
son College faculty, aided the fire-
men greatly by organizing bucket
brigades and removing property.
The College Inn is under the man-
agement ,of Mrs. Annye Strick-
land. I

The damage caused by the fire
necessitated suspension of business
at.the Inn for, several days, how-
ever, things were in full again at
the first of the week. Estimaters
from the company which held in-
surance for the structure were here
to make adjustments. —
