fldmissions Office forgets Class of 2009 — Senior stuck in

new records each year for both number
of applicants and
selectivity; this
year we_ have
been unable to
do so.”

Many had
been wondering
about the atypi-
cal silence from
Admissions this
year due to their
history of releas-
ing several state-
ments during the
first semester
regarding the
impending suc-
cess of the
recruiting year.

Several other
members of the
Admissions
team, however,
have more can-
explana-

tions. “Basically,
we just forgot
about the whole admissions thing this
year,” said Assistant Dean James Serfas.
“I mean, there was one hell of a party at

Juniors not shutting up about abroad

Juniors returning to Davidson from a
semester abroad often report feeling
alienated, depressed about coming
back, and disconnected from their
friends.

Said Peter Willis ’06, who recently
returned from a semester in Australia, “I
almost feel like I belong in Australia, not

here. It’s just that I can’t explain my
experience in Australia, like all those
cool bars, the skydiving, and the beauti-
ful sunset cruises. And, nobody under-
stands how I feel, because everyone else
studied in Melbourne, and I was in
Sydney. Plus, I miss all my friends who I
met in Australia, but then again, it’s easy
to visit them because most of them go to
Florida State.”

Alice Wilkins, the Assistant
Coordinator for Study Abroad,
explained, “the phenomenon ‘going nat-
ural’ happens to many who study
abroad. After the initital culture shock,
many students begin.to want to ‘fit in’
and express this wish through various
lifestyle changes. For example, I know of

Naomi Heldon ’06 in Segovia, Spain.

many students who studied in England
who, after a couple of weeks, began to
use an English accent as well as English
slang. I remember when one came back
and had a lot of trouble ardering ‘chips,’
or french fries, from the Union Cafe.”
Most commonly, though, students
returning from abroad express the

changes that they underwent abroad by
a new wardrobe, more subtle changes in
speech patterns, or a new hairstyle.

Explained Frank Sommers ’06, who
studied in Barcelona, Spain, “I’ve really
adapted a more ‘European’ style of
dress, which is definitely more fashion-
forward. I’ve also started wearing sever-
al necklaces, and I grew my hair long.”

Many students who did not go abroad
are somewhat annoyed by the changes
and new affects seen in their friends
who have come back from overseas.

Amanda Childs ’06, roommate of
returning junior Naomi Heldon, com-
plained of Heldon’s lengthy stories and
boring anecdotes from her fall semester
in Seville, Spain.

“When she first got back, I wanted
Naomi to tell me about her abroad expe-
rience,” Childs said, “but after an 18-
minute description of her favorite tapas
bar, my interest’ began to wane. And I
didn’t say this out loud, but who the hell
wants to hear an in-depth history of ‘la
Catedral de Sevilla’ or Madrid’s ‘Museo
del Prado’? I can’t stand how she always
uses that pretentious Spanish accent
when she says ‘Catedral’ or ‘Museo’.”

“| can’t stand
how she always
uses that preten-
tious Spanish
accent when she
says ‘Catedral’ or
“‘Museo’.”

SET
According to friend Tom Sherman

’05, Heldon not only bores him with her
stories but has changed her attitude
toward America.

“The other day she went on this self-
righteous rant about how wasteful
American are and how conscientious
Europeans are. All because I drove to
CVS instead of walking. She even had
the nerve to say ‘you Americans,’ as if
she isn’t one herself.

“And who does she think she is with
that ridiculous Real Madrid scarf and
Brasil soccer jersey?” he said.

Like many returning juniors, Heldon
is apparently unaware that her stories
are abysmally uninteresting and
extremely repetitive. “I love being back
at Davidson because I get to tell every-
one all about my semester. And there’s
so much more to tell! I could still talk for
hours about the impromptu flamenco
show, the breathtaking view of Granada,
and the diverse youth hostel in
Barcelona.”

Beth’s place in August the night before
we were supposed to start on sending
out this year’s materials. I don't really
remember the next morning, and from
what I can tell, neither does anyone
else.”

He continued, “I guess we totally for-
got to send out those course catalogs to
high schools. And, I knew that I was for-
getting something, but unfortunately, I
didn’t remember that it was school visits

“Unfortunately,
I didn’t remember
that it was school
visits in Florida
that | was
forgetting”

STAT
in Florida that I was forgetting. Oh well,

you can’t go up every year,”

Wilcox, while not making any state-
ment regarding causes, concurred that
materials were not sent out on time. “I
admit that we might have been tardy in
our recruiting. And, nobody showed up
to lead the info sessions. But, if we look
at the cost-benefit analysis, we can see
that with the money we save in not
sending out mailings, we can buy more
t-shirts for accepted students. Most of
those people think that they got a view-
book from Dickinson anyway.”

Admissions Counselor Andrew
Hartman ‘oo said, “It’s lucky that we
even are going to have a Class of 2009. I
happened to check the Admissions mail-
box before Winter Break, and apparent-
ly nobody had thought to do that all
year. It was stuffed with applications,
and there was another box inside the
mail room. If I hadn’t checked that, we
wouldn’t even know that people had
applied this year.”

Wilcox again refused to confirm or
deny this statement.

With the sudden realization of the
need for an admissions process, the
office sprang to work over the break,
hiring three new Senior Admissions
Fellows to help with the workload. One
of the new hireges, Dana Rickles ’05, was
available for comment. “I was there
when Andy [Hartmann] told Dean
Wilcox about the applications being in
the Admissions mailbox. The next thing
I knew, she had shoved about 20 appli-
cations and a $100 into my hands and
told me to start reading.” As of January
15, Wilcox reported that almost 300
applications had been successfully read
and another 400 skimmed.

“Thank goodness for the fieid hockey
team is all I have to say,” Admissions
Counselor Albert Young said. “Without
their recruiting, we would never have
come close to filling up the girls’ halls
next year.” All athletes have been con-
tacted with instructions to encourage
former high school teammates to apply
for the extended deadline, no longer
Jan. 2, but father March 2 for regular
decision.

And, claimed Wilcox, there might be
benefits to having a very small incoming
class. “Granted, our “US News” ranking
is probably going to get hurt a little bit.
But, at least RLO will finally shut up,
and stop breathing down our neck to let
fewer people in. Plus, our student to fac-
ulty ratio is way down, so we can use
that on tours. Ih no time, we'll be just
where we left off.”

6:30 a.m. class

The trials and_ tribulations of
drop/add and schedule adjustment are
well-known to most Davidson students
and faculty. For Robbie Bowd ‘os, the
frustrations of class scheduling went”
beyond the normal annoyance and
ended up costing him a large amount of
sleep.

Due to a computer glitch, Bowd was
accidentally placed among the freshmen
in the Web Tree lottery numbering sys-
tem. Since his numbers were so low, by
the time the registrar got to his Web
Tree, all of the classes Bowd had
requested were full, so the registrar
placed him in whichever classes still had
openings, most of which were freshmen
courses. Luckily, when Bowd got his
schedule, he was able to talk the profes-
sors of three of the classes he had origi-
nally wanted into raising the ceiling.
Unfortunately, one professor refused,
leaving him with only three classes.

“All of the professors were really nice
and understanding when I told them
about my predicament. They all said
that it was no problem to add me to their
rosters. But the professor for the litera-
ture course | wanted was totally unrea-
sonable and wouldn't take pity on me or
listen to my reasons why I would have
been a great addition to his class. It
wouldn't have been a big deal if it hadn't
have been for the fact that I still needed
my literature requirement in order to
graduate,” Bowd explained.

So he resorted to searching the
drop/add website to find his final
course. It came down to two classes: The
Literature of William Faulkner at 8:30
a.m. and the newly-added literature
course Contemporary Neo-Classical
Eastern European Literature.

After a brief discussion with his
adviser, Bowd decided to pick up the
class in “Contemporary Neo-Classical
Eastern European Literature.”

Said Bowd, “I thought about it for a
long time, weighed the pros and cons for
each class, and finally decided that the
6:30 a.m. class would be my best bet. If
I didn’t have such an extreme aversion
to William Faulkner, I might have gone
with the 8:30 a.m.”

He continued, “I mean, 6:30 a.m. is
extremely early, but at least I can grab
some breakfast afterwards and then go
back to sleep before my 1:30 p.m. class.
Plus, the Eastern European Lit class is
taught by a visiting professor, so hope-
fully it’ll be pretty easy.”
