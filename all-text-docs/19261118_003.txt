THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 18, 1926

VOLUNTEER BAND MEETS

Dr. K. J. Foreman of the faculty led the.
Volunteer Band in an open discussion on |

the “Religions of the World,” at their}

regular meeting, Sunday at ten o’clock.!

The president, J. A. McAlpine opened
the meeting by calling for a few songs,
after which a few minutes of de open
period were held.

Mr. Foreman ably discussed the reli-
gions of many nations. He called for the

ideas of many of the members, who!

responded with either a question or an
. 7 {
answer. Quite a féw visitors attended

the meeting and they also added their
ideas to those of the students on the
religions of other countries.

A short business session was presided
over by the president of the band, J. A.
McAlpine. Matters of interest and bus-
iness to the club were discussed in a brief
period ‘preceding the main talk.

The aim of the club, to stimulate a de-

; ; ‘ |
sire for going to the foreign fields or to

arouse interest in the foreign mission
work, is carried out in every program.
The topic for the next meeting will be
the “History of Missions in China.”
has not yet been decided as to who will
lead this meeting, but it is thought the

speakers will be chosen from the band.

Messrs. John Currie, Sam Currie, Neil
Currie, and Neil McMillan the

spent
week-end with Mr.

Daniel. Currie.

Dr. Charlie Attributes
Victory to Luck Omens

Negro Trainee Believes in His
Horseshoes and Rabbit Feet

| Various things have been attributed as
the reason, for the Wildcat victory over
Carolina here last Saturday, when the
Davidson team defeated the Tar Heels,
10 too. But it is the belief of one Charlie
Wilson, negro, who looks after the ail-
ments of the individual players, that
“Lady Luck” showed her face that day.

“Doctor” Charlie, as he is known to
students, was gloriously bedecked Satur-
day with two large rabbit feet dangling
from his white coat elaborately decora-
ted with a snarling Wildcat in front. Not
content with his public display in luck,
he had put a rabbit foot inside the foot-
ball, buried another under one of the
| goals, and not even satisfied with that
turned to another phase of luck, burying
a horseshoe under the other.

Nothing was known of the last three

silent emblems of luck, but the two feet }

upon his coat were noticeably prominent
}to spectators. After the game he took
| his spade and dug up the horseshoe and
rabbit foot, and claims them now as his
; most treasured Veryefew
jalumni were as proud as Charlie when
