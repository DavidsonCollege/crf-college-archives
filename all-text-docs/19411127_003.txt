Last year there was much talk in
the line of needed items for the
material part of the “Y.” Among
these was a pool table—remember?

Thoughtlessness usually produces
some kind of destruction and soon

rescue! This class of action
quickly mustered its forces and
made its first move\ together by
pooling their quarters and_ half
dollars for the benefit of the art

of pool playing. Monday the fin-
ishing touches were put on the new
cover and a host of undergraduates
descended upon the defenseless
four-legged flat-piece with a shout.

Wouldn't it be wonderful if that
enthusiasm would keep up through-
out the year and prevent the de-
struction of this new gift? Only last
year our table was with brand new
trimmings; this year fellows called
the cover shreds. Actually, there
were foot prints found on it last

least be gentleman enough to show
our gratefulness. Here's to the
