YMCA SUMMER PROGRAM
by Dolph Allen

During the sunimer the YMCA has
only a miniature program in operation.
It is hoped that the hall prayer meet-
ings, Sunday evening devotionals, and
chapel services will answer some of the
spiritual needs of the students. Soft
ball, tennis, and other activities, we
hope, will take care of the physical
requirements of our lives,

The work in the Negro community will
continue throughout the summer, This
program consists primarily of working
with the teen-age club which meets on
Thursday nights. At the same time,
movies are shown to the younger Negro
children.

Another area of community work in
which we need student help is in cone
ducting the Recreation Program for
180 Davidson youths,

The program of the "y" exists solely
for the students, and the success of it
depends entirely upon student support
and participation. e are open at all
times to your suggestions and ideas.
