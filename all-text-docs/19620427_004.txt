New Water-Based Era

Davidsonian Feature Writer

Lake Norman Promises

‘When the gates of the Cowans Ford Dam slammed shut earlier this year, a new
life began for Davidson. It is not yet clearly visible; but it has already started, as
witnessed by the visit of Duke Power’s Henry Cheney to the campus last week and
‘Dan Adams’ last cartoon in THE DAVIDSONIAN.

It is a life that. will be char- have to purchase or lease it; long and has an average width

acterized by water rather than
land, by a speed boat rather
than a hot rod. A new IFC
sports program will come into
effect to take advantage of the
water. And perhaps even a lake-
shore bar will replace Hattie’s
as the Davidson ' Gentleman's
favorite place of relaxation.
COLLEGE SITE

The college will. for a certain-
ty, have a spot on the lake. Busi-
ness Manager Robert Currie’s
official statement on the matter
reads, “The college plans to ac-
quire an adequate recreational
site on the lake at a reasonable
distance from the campus.”

This statement may not sound
like much to encourage water-
enthusiasts. But Currie hinted
at more when I questioned him.
It is safe to say that Davidson
will have a very sizable piece
of land at the lake, probably
more than five acres. Currie did
not care to comment where the
land would come from or where
it would be located. But, it ap-
pears that the collége will not

Conservative Club |

Chooses Voorhees

Dick Voorhees, a rising senior
from Winston-Salem, was elect-
ed president of the newly-form-
ed Conservative Club at the
group's meeting Wednesday
night.

Three rising sophomores were ,
selected to fill out the slate of |

rather it will be a gift, most
probably from the Duke Power
Company itself.

Currie stated that the plan-
ning for the development of the
land had not yet started. “The
college realizes the need for
bathing facilities and a spot to
launch boats, and these things
will be taken into consideration
in the planning,” Currie said.
“We will probably have a com-
mercial marina located near our
land. The college does not plan
to have a bodt launch on its
own land,” he added.

NO TO FRATERNITIES

And while Lake Norman has
been filling, President D. G.
Martin has been turning over
in his mind the question of fra-
ternity land on the lake.” For
water-lovers in a Greek organi-
zation, the outlook is not good.

“It has been the policy of the
college in the past to forbid the
ownership of‘ any land by a fra-
ternity,” Martin said. “Even
though the matter has not come
up officially, I personally am
opposed to fraternities securing
land on the lake.” President
Martin feels that the crux of
the thing.is that the fraternities
with lakeside facilities will have
an unfair advantage over other
fraternities in acquiring pledges.
“The very reason that the col-
lege built fraternity-row was to
keep competition at a minimum
between fraternities,” he said.

But even with no fraternity
lodges being permitted on Lake
Norman, Davidson students are

Cheney was a bit more in-

of 142 miles; the dam is 130
feet high, 90 feet thick at its
base, and built at total cost of
$62 million; and Lake Norman

will be the largest body of
water entirely within the state
of North Oarolina.

Upon completion, the power
plant. on the west side of the
dam will be the fourth largest
capacity privately owned hydro-
electric generating center.in the
country. Four turbine genera-
tors with capccities of 87,500
kilowatts can produce a total
capacity of 350,000 kilowatts if

necessary.

Cheney said that anyone in-
terested in leasing land on the
lake should send a letter to the
Real Estate Dept.; Duke Power
Co., lotte. All that would
be ne in the letter would
be to ask to get on the Lake
Norman Site List.

Unfinished construction con-

has begun on the plant. The
Catawba River has .already had
its flow interrupted, and Lake
Norman has begun to fill. Duke
Power will soon have a generat-

idson College will soon have a
new way of life with a water

FAF Literary Element

Has Owen,

Kennedy

BY BILL TROTTER
Davidsonian Fine Arts Critic

“Writing is the loneliest business in the world,” said

Guy Owen, sinking down into the humid Union easy chair.
It was a good way to bring that occupation into focus.
The perception of that focus increased as one listened to
Dr. Swen. For he is a writer, and he knows what that
strange sort of calling involves.

He is a part of what might be
termed the literary element of
the Fine Arts Festival| which
was climaxed on Thursday with
his presenting the Vereen\Bell
Award, and with the podty
reading by X. J. Kennedy. This
emphasis on writing was cer-
tainly made, more valuable by
Dr. Owen. For he brought out, in
his conversation the fascinating
and frustrating paradox that is
writing.

Writing blends art, craft,
luck probably more than any
other “art, and its greatest
peradox, as Mr. Owen seemed
to stress, is thet it has a
strong business side to it —
the daily drudgery of editing,
polishing, rewriting—all the
chores which stand fer re-
moved from the hot gush of
inspiration.

Dr. Owen considered his own
personal mission to be that of a
sensitive reflecting historian,
trying to suspend from time’ the
spirit of a certain region with
which he fells identified. The
elusive inspiration to write, he
defines as an internal itching,
a nagging persistence that sim-
ply will not leave the writer
until it has been put on paper.
He believes in the validity an
inspirational flash, but holds
firmly to the conviction that
ideas which do not ripen and
continue to mature and goad
after their initial impact, should
be ruthlessly weeded-out.

He is more fully aware of the
dangers imherent in regional
fiction than most authors. “Peo-
ple don’t mind being put into a
novel unless it’s the truth,” he
comments wrily, after relating
some of his own experiences a-
mong the people of the region
about which he wrote his first
novel, Season Of Feer.

A writer's primary training
should be to develop a love
and a respect for words, not
@ ponderous vocabulary neces-
sarily, but “good, masculine,
decisive Anglo-Saxon words.”
One criterion for the writer
to judge the success of a piece
of work by is when “his char-
acters suddenly begin to sur
prise him and tive of their
own accord.”

Also fine in a different way,
was the Thursday night poetry
reading by X. J. Kennedy. Mr.
Kennedy was a large, shambling
man, with a soft-spoken manner,
and a deceptively sharp wit that
soon had the audience delighted.
He began the program with a
Frost poem ("That way if you
think my stuff is bad, the eve-
ning won't be a total loss.”) and
followed it with what he termed
“the worst poem I have ever
read” (“So that my stuff won't
look so bad after all.”).

“His stuff” was certainly far

from bad. Hearing a poet read
his own works is somewhat
like hearing a composer con-
duct his own piece—there is
a ring of authority that is
uniquely individual. So it was
with Mr. Kennedy's voice—
it had a feathery magnetism
end precision that made you
listen closely. Though it may
be objectionable to pick o
poem apart, such a thing be-
comes truely justifiable when.
thé poet does the picking.

His poem displayed a joyous
eit and simplicity that was re-
markable. He won the audience
immediately and kept his pace
moving so that no part of his
reading dragged. The entire eve-
ning was one of the most relax-
ed and downright fun-filled that
Hodson Hall has seen this year.
Mr. Kennedy can come back any
time.

It remains only to make the
bald statement that his audience
consisted of less than thirty
people.

of Admissions.

Martin is an English major
and intends to attend a Presby-
terian Seminary following one

office. Next year his duties will
involve interviewing and _ visit-
ing the schools of prospective
students, as well as administra-
tive work.

At Davidson, he has been a

Literary Society and Le Cercle
Francais. In his junior year he
served as a feature writer for
THE DAVIDSONIAN and on the

Annual Editor Sets
Distribution Date

“The annuals will be here in
about ten days,” Rob Abernethy,
editor of the 1962 Quips and
Cranks, said today. “We'll have
notices in the chapel announce-
ment sheet and on the bulletin
boards around campus to let
everybody know when they can
pick them up.”

Abernethy said distribution
will be carried out in the same
way it was done last year, ex-
cept that more staff members
will be in the annual office to
speed up the process. Five days
after the distribution date,
books that have not been called
for will be sold to anyone who
wants an extra copy.

‘This year’s Quips and Cranks
will probably make some de.
mands on the reader,” he con-

September, they want something
more than a collection of com:
posite pictures and lists of
names.

“The book is more than a di-
rectory, and it is not a journa
listic or historical account of
this year at Davidson. We have
attempted a careful, systematic
study of the Davidson student.
This statement is vague but I
think you'll understand when
you read the book.

“If, you'll read the annual
from front to back, noticing that
many of our photographs have
an implied meaning which is
more significant than the ob-
vious content, 1 think you'll see
what we've tried to get across.”
