Weezer guides tour of a fetish

'Y JAMES BERRY
taff Writer

I suspect that Rivers Cuomo,
‘ad singer, rhythm guitarist, and
tinciple songwriter for Weezer,
as a thing for Japanese girls. Let
1e tell you why.

Looking over the band’s lat-
st album, Pinkerton, is like fol-
wing the dotted trails of a trea-
ire map to the elusive X. A farcry
‘om the baby blue portrait of the
and in all their alternative anti-
lory, Pinkerton’ s liner notes credit
lirishige’s “Kambara: Night
now” with this sophomore cover.
Vhat does this prove? Nothing.
tut if you check out the back cover
ou’ll notice the faint watermark
f an Japanese woman in what I
uess to be traditional clothing.

Open the jewel case and a
crap of an image peeks out from
he center of that black plastic panel
hat clamps the disc in place. Be-
tind it you’ ll find an old map of

apan with small drawings of
vooden seafaring ships (one of
which is the U.S.S. Pinkerton — I
hink I can guess where they got
he title).

If this isn’t enough, the song
“Across the Sea” is about an 18-
year-old girl from Japan who sent
a letter to Cuomo and, though he’s
intrigued, he admits “I could never
touch you/I. think it would be
wrong/I’ ve got your letter/You’ ve
got my song.” But the kicker is the
song “El Scorcho” when, over a
drunken acoustic riff, Cuomo belts
“God damn you half-Japanese
girls/You do it to me every time/
The red head said you shred the
cello/And I’m jello, baby.” Case
dismissed.

Like Weezer’s self-titled de-
but, Pinkerton bases its sound on a
blend of heavily distorted guitars,
asolid bass, some consistent drum-
ming, and a unique, three part vo-
cal delivery. The treats exclusive
to this album, besides Cuomo’s

‘sugary melodies, lie in the band’s
self-production.

They chose to throw in the
occasional synthesized guitar,
some distortion on the bass, and
even a dab of slide guitar while
holding back on the vocal har-
mony and acoustic overdubs. Also,
the.quieter parts of the songs don’t
commit to a strictly clean sound
(without distortion) but the benefit
is a highly organic quality to the
music.

Add to this a metered sloppi-
ness and result is a very live, very
real sound usually absent from
mainstream albums which tend to
crank up the reverb (the effect you
get when you’re singing in the
shower—the one that makes your
voice sound good even if youcan’t
carry a tune) at every available
opportunity.

Pinkerton’s lyrics revolve
around a few conspicuous themes.
And, since every song is written by
Rivers Cuomo, listening to the al-
bum is like listening to an internal

dialogue. Most of the songs fit -

comfortably into a category coined
by one of my friends as “chick
songs’——a form dedicated to the
unending pursuit of girls,

Though the form is conven-
tional, the obstacles in Cuomo’s
way are not. In “Tired of Sex,” he
explores meaningless physical en-
counters, narrating the events of
one week. “Monday night I’m
making Jen/Tuesday night I’m
making Lin/Wednesday night I’m
making Cathrine.” He sums up his

feelings about the situation in one
line: “So why can’t I be making
love come true.”

Another song, “Pink Tri-
angle,” finds Cuomo ready to tie
the knot with a. lesbian. It opens

with a guitar and xylophone duet
reminiscent of 50s Christmas bal-
lads before swan diving into the
Weezer brand of roaring guitars.
“T’mdumb she’s alesbian/I thought
I had found the one.”

. Cuomo often finds his own

" personality at fault for his failure

in love. In “Why Bother?” he
questions the benefits of a rela-

tionships over the inevitable pain -

of a break up. “Why bother?/It’s
gonna hurt me/It’s gonnakill when
you desert me/This happened to
me twice before/It won’t happen
any more.” Though recognizably
different, Pinkerton doesn’t mark

much of a departure from the es- .

tablished Weezer sound.

Chances are, if you liked “Un-
done (the sweater song)” and “Say
It Ain’t So,” you'll love this al-
bum. But if you, say, enjoy ridi-
culing your friends by calling the

band such names as “Sneezer,” ©

you’d be better off ignoring the
fact that there’s another album out
to annoy you.
