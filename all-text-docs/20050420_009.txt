The Davidsonian

The Davidson Collegé administra-
tion announced Friday that after a
string of recent controversies, The
Davidsonian will be taken over indefi-
nitely by the Office of College
Communications.

Within the past several months, ten-
sion had been growing between the
editors of the
newspaper and
the administra-

‘ot Davidson President Tom Cloris

66, “Unfortunately, we do not feel that
the current editorial board of The
Davidsonian newspaper is well repre-
senting Davidson College at this point.
They seem to have forgotten that the
newspaper is read by important alumni
and by people from outside who judge

The head of the Office of College”
Communications, Andrew Walker ’72,
echoed Cloris’ statements. “I have a
feeling that many Davidson students
are sick and tired of the consistently
anti-Davidson slant of The
Davidsonian. Davidson is a great place,
and the newspaper should show that. If

press involving
issues such as the

the controversy over the change in the
Trustee religious requirement and the
subsequent resignations. The adminis-
tration feared that not only had the
newspaper become too powerful, but
also that it was also causing unrest
among the students, and giving both
alumni as well as people from outside
the Davidson community a negative
view of the college.

this weekend really pissed me off. All
these little kids running around my
school just rubs me the wrong way,

especially because next year, they're
going to be annoying little freshmen. I

me off, because they don’t w how
Davidson used to be. And now, at the
end of second semester, all the fresh-
men think that they’re hot stuff, just
because they've almost been here for a

year.

This year’s freshmen have no ‘idea
how much Davidson has changed since
my freshman year. Take something like
the Union Café. Now they have pasta
specials. In the old days, they used to
have specials on all sorts of food, like
shrimp and stir-fry kind of stuff. But
this year’s freshmen don’t know any-
thing about that. I bet alot of freshmen
don’t even know that there was no such
thing as the Big Cat Burger last year.
And, I know that they don’t know that
before the new Union opened, there
was the Outpost, which was so much
better than the Union Café. Even
though I was never here for the
Outpost, I’ve heard a lot of good stuff
about it.

This year’s freshman weren’t even
here for the old Chambers. They prob-
ably think that it’s always looked like it
does now. Guess what: it didn’t.

Another thing that pisses me off is
when people call West by its new name,
“Tomlinson.” I always call it West,
because even though it was Tomlinson
last year, people still called it West.
And the freshmen should know that the
Kappa Sig house is called the Kappa Sig
house, no matter which frat or eating
house is using it.

I hate it when freshmen call the
Freshmen Olympics “Baker Night.”
Back in the day, we did the Freshmen
Olympics during orientation, and did
PE 101, not Davidson 101. I get so
annoyed when I hear some dumb
freshman saying that she’s got
“Davidson: 101.”

One time I told a freshman that I
wanted a red bike, and she had no idea
what I was talking about. I guess they
call them “community bikes” now.

Freshmen also have it a lot easier
this year. I mean, Belk looks like a
damn hotel now. It used to be a whole
lot less nice. This year’s freshmen have
no idea how the sinks used to look, and
how the urinals were before the reno-
vations. That old style Davidson stuff is
lost forever.

The cops used to be a whole lot less
strict too. I can tell you that some of the
stuff that used to go on would not fly

the school based on what they read in
The Davidsonian. It is extremely irre-
sponsible for them to publish these
extremely negative articles that show
the school in a bad light. Until the stu-
dent editors can learn to better edit
what they say, I feel that the Office of
College Communications will do a
capable job of publishing The
Davidsonian.”

anymore. These new kids have no idea
how crazy it used to be here. And, this
year’s seniors are so tame compared to
last year’s.

What’s even more annoying is that
all the changes that are going to hap-
pen for next year. Did you know that
the housing lottery is going to be done
over the Internet? Next year’s fresh-
men won't have any idea that it used to
be done in Chambers Gallery. And,
how about Commons? They will never
have eaten a meal in the old Commons,
and that just pisses me off.

“Even though |
was never
actually here for
the Outpost,
I've still heard a
lot of good things
about it.”

I think that as part of Orientation,
the freshmen should have a session on
Davidson history. They already do a lit-
tle bit on that, but it’s all about really
old stuff that doesn’t matter anymore,
like the ghost of Chambers.

But, I did learn some important stuff
during the Davidson history session.
For example, freshmen used to have to
wear funny hats to identify themselves.
I'll tell you what, I think that’s a good
idea. Freshmen just don’t respect their
elders anymore. We should bring back
some system of seniority, because as
someone who’s been here for a while, I
think I deserve a few more rights than
some freshman who’s been here for
most of a semester.

At least they should have parking by
class, because I can tell you that there
is nothing more annoying than seeing a
car with just one parking sticker taking

anything, I think that the new
Davidsonians will be more fair and bal-
anced.”

Student reactions to the announce-
ment were mixed. Some students, such
as Amy Eckerds ’07, felt that the
College Communications published

Davidsonian would not accurately
report the news. “The fact is,” said
Eckerds, “The Davidsonian is going to

read like a press release. If I wanted to
read some positive fluff about
Davidson, I’d check out the website.
The only people who should be happy
about this are the Libertas guys,
because now people might actually
read it.”

Other students, though, are happy
about the change. Peter Estos ’06,
“When I get back to my room on
Wednesday night, I don’t feel like get-
ting all depressed by reading The
Davidsonian. Now, I can just read
some cute, fun articles, rather than
stuff about how bad Davidson is.”

Ask

Once again, I answer real questions
about their true sex life that actual
Davidson students sent in to me, an
anonymous expert on sex.

From a male student: I really
have trouble putting on a con-
dom, but I don’t want my girl-
friend to get pregnant. We’ve
been trying a lot of stuff for
birth control that we’ve heard
about on the Internet and in my
fraternity house, for example,
Saran Wrap, “washing” with
vinegar, and spraying Lysol. I
was wondering if these ideas are
good, and if you have any other
good birth control tips.

First off, these are all good birth
control methods, especially Saran
Wrap, which is known as the “barrier
method.” There are some problems
with the barrier method and. break-
age, so always make sure that the
Saran Wrap is not stretched too thin.
Other barriers include tin foil,
wadded up newspaper, and home
insulation. A little known fact: tin foil
was originally introduced for birth
control!

For extra protection, try spreading
deli mustard on the saran wrap (make

are also a type of barrier method, but

always make sure that you test
the strength of the condom
that you are going to use by
filling it up with water before-
hand and looking for leaks and
breakage.

The other methods, known
as the “clean up method,”
while less reliable, also work
very well. Problems associated
with them include severe irri-
tation. Moreover, it is extreme-
ly important that you perform
them quickly, or else pregnan-
cy may ensue. Also, these
methods do not work against
STDs as well as the barrier
method.

From a female student:
I took your advice last
week about how best to
pleasure my boyfriend,
and after he came back
from Lake Norman
General Hospital, where
he was treated for severe
blood loss, he dumped me.
How can I win him back?

One word: whips and handcuffs.
For most guys, pain equals pleasure,
so the more you hurt him, the more
he'll like it. If I were you, I would tell
him that you just want to apologize to
him about the incident, and when he
comes to your room, turn off the
lights, slip on a little leather, and
turn on some European industrial
music (I recommend Rammstein).
See where it goes from there!

If I know your boyfriend, and I do
from the report I received about his
injuries, he actually enjoyed his hos-
pital trip. I wouldn't be surprised if
his “dumping you” was part of a role-

with you.

I have yet to meet a guy who does
not like to play role-playing games,
especially the one with the female
janitor and the office worker. You
might want to invest in a sanitation
worker’s uniform; do that, and wait
for your boyfriend to come to your
door, get down on his knees and
plead for sweet, sensual mercy.

Arousingly,
Dr. Sexpert!
