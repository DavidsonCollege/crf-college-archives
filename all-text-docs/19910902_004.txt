bring back a student-run FM sta-
tion. That is not an easy undertak-
ing. In order to make the FM sta-
tion a reality, the people at WALT
must obtain a license from the
Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC). First, usually before
even contacting the FCC, the pro-
spective station must pay fora fre-
quency search to determine if an
open frequency exists.

If there is one open, an applica-
tion must then be registered with
the FCC. The:application process
is so technical it usually requires
the services of a lawyer to guaran-
tee that the application has been
completed correctly. According to
Towle, if there are any problems
with applications, the FCC refuses
to consider the application.

New Rule

ways in thatit keeps freshman from
being divided and keeps houses
from over-rushing.

Powell Spears, president of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, thinks that
this regulation will be good in that

The FCC has also ‘gradually
eliminated smaller power levels at
whichstations can broadcast, says
Towle, and he fears the 500 watt
level, at whic WALT has found a
frequency, will be next to go.

Noteveryone believes the sta-
tion is such a grand idea, however.
Dean of Students Will Terry be-
lieves that there is not a strong
need for both the emerging
Davidson College Television
(DCTV) and a radio station.

Towle, on the other hand, be-
lieves that the students would
widely supportand listen toan FM
station on campus. “I think stu-
dentsupportis overwhelming. I’ve
just been inundated with throngs
of people that want to help in some
capacity and given our situation
I’ve been forced to say that until
the trustees give the go-ahead
there’s nothing to do but see if
they’ll sit and listen to our case.”

sophomores can interact more with
upperclassmen instead of worry-
ing aboutrushing freshmenas they
have in years past.

This new policy went int6
effect last Monday. The Patterson
Courtpresidents will handle house
violations of this regulation and
the Dean of Students will handle
penalties committed by freshmen.
