YOUNGER AND TILSON

Develop Wonder Machine From
Poor Material—Year’s Play
Shows Excellent Team-
Work

With the traditional Wildcat fight that
since the closing days of the nineteenth cen-
tury has characterized the Davidson teams
Coach Younger’s eleven came back in the
last quarter of the Thanksgiving Day game
to defeat Trinity and close one of the most
successful seasons in the history of the col-
lege. Winning seven games and ticing one
out of 10 starts, the Davidson team estab-
lished an enviable record among the colleges
of the state, besides marking up more games
won than ever before in the history of the
college,

After years and years of football despair,
the Red and Black team has come forth to
blaze in the glory of a hard-fought’ and well-
played season. Coming to Davidson in the
fall of 1923, Monk Younger and Tex Tilson
found the gridiron conditions at Davidson
even worse than they anticipated. From the
very start the two football stars started
building for the 1924 team, but withdrawals
of several stars, along with the scarcity of
line material at the close of a rather mediocre
season, found the fall of 1924 promising lit-
tle, if any, hopes of football success.

As throughout the two Carolinas the foot-
ball fans are talking of the great team that
the two hard-working coaches have built at
Davidson and as the pickers of the mythical
all-state team have almost
placed Baker and Vance on their Als, so the
watchers of the fighting machine are begin-
ning to talk of the two coaches who have
developed all this out of the most unhopeful
material,

unanimously

Christening Richardson Field in a game of
mud and water, the ‘Davidson team opened
the 1924 football season with a 14-0 victory
over the Elon squad. Despite the slippery
ground, Nick Sappenfield got off with the
longest run of the season, either for or
against Davidson, as he caught a Christian
punt and raced for 72 yards down the cast
side of the field. The playing of driving end
runs and off-tackle plays of Lucian Wells led
to the first touchdown, while Tom Baker and
Captain Davis starred on the defensive play
ofthe contest.

One week later the Davidson team staged
another great rally as led by Jim Hendrix's
sweeping end runs and smashing off-tackle
plays, Coach Younger’s men came back in
the last half to defeat Presbyterian College
by the most decisive score in the history of
the two schools, the South Carolinians going
down by a 15-3 count in-a thrilling game at
Asheville. :

After playing the first half of the Rich-
mond University game in Winston-Salem in
a rather spectacular nip-and-tuck fashion,
the Davidson team opened up an offense in
the third quarter that swept the Spiders down
the field for 54 yords, Sapp crossing theegoal
line on the winning play. The 7-0 victory
was again featured by the great playing of
Captain Davis and Baker, while Leggette’s
punting and return of punts was of great
value to the Red and Black team.

While the hottest sun of the season broil-
ed down upon Richardson Field, the Wofford

uy Terriers .put up a game fight against the Da-

vidson eleven only to lose in the last half

when Sook Boggs broke through the line into

an opposing punt and fell gn it for a 7-0

Their Membership

The public ceremonies of the Phi Beta
initiation will be held on Friday, December
Sth, in Shearer Hall, at 8:00 o'clock. The
Gamma Chapter considers itself very for-
tunate to have secured as the speaker of the
evening Dr. William Spenser Currell.

Dr. Currell is a very popular and distin-
guished speaker, and those who have heard
him before do not need to be urged to be
present to hear him again. Davidson men
will be more interested in him after noting
that he was a classmate of Dr. Harding at
Hampden-Sidney.

Glee Club Appears Here

Program of Unusual Merit to be

Boys

“Music, Melody ‘and Mirth” will reign su-

when “Piggy” Martin and his musical co-
horts, members of the glee club, appear for
the first time this season before a local au-
dience. The program will open promptly at
7:30 o'clock, and the rafters of old Shearer
Hall will resound with music for two ensu-
ing hours, while the youthful exponents of
melody test their abilities before home-town
listeners.

The program next Tuesday evening will
be very much the same as that to be staged
at the various stops on the annual Southern
tour of the club; and, with its super-abund-
ance of variety, it is sure to send the audi-
ence away well pleased. The club has prac-

Sterling-Reid Bill Will be Subject

Colleges

The Davidson College debating team, com-
posed of C. W. Williams, D. B: Wharton
and A, H. Hollingsworth, left this morning
for Atlanta, where they will meet a team
that represents Emory University there to-
morrow night. The subject under discussion
is, “Resolved, That the Sterling-Reid edu-
cational bill should he enacted into law by
the present Congress.” The Davidson rep-
resentatives in the forensic art will uphold
the affirmative side of the question, while
Emory will contend ‘for the negative.

Big Business the Theme _
of Dr. Foster at “Y”

Points Out Christ as Human Being
—Makes Fine Appeal to Listeners

Big Business was the theme of J. S. Fos-
ter, pastor of First Presbyterian Church of
Winston-Salem, in his address before the
Y. M. C. A., Sunday evening.

Doctor Foster, a graduate of Southwest-
ern University, was introduced by Dr. Frazer
Hood, who is also an alumnus of South-
western.

“The large things in life attract me,” said
the speaker in opening. “The fascination of
the big things is natural.”

The. question that comes to us then is
“What are the big things in life?” The in-
cident of Andrew calling his brother Simon
to Christ, as related in .the-first chagter, of
John, was cited as an example of a layman
engaged in the biggest thing in life, bringing
another man to Christ. “He first findeth
his brother Simon and saith unto him, we
