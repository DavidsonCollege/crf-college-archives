THE DAVIDSONIAN

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 23,1992

-Davidsonian Interview:Bob McKillop

D: The first and most obvious
thing that comes to mind with
this year’steam is the seven fresh-
men. What kind of role do you
expect each of the guys to play,
and what kind of contribution
do you expect.them to make?

M: Perhaps the great thing about
this mix of veterans and freshmen
is that the veterans that are in the
program are established veterans,
in terms of experience, minutes
they’ve played, and success they’ve
had. And when you throw three or
four freshmen into the fire without
thatsupport base of aveteran group,
itmakes it difficult. This is the first
time since I’ve been here that the
freshmen will be cast into roles,
supported by a veteran group that
is talented and experienced. So I
think that’s the first statement you
can make about the freshmen. It’s
not going to be on their shoulders
as it has been in the process of
trying to build the program. As far
as what role they will play, we’ve
gota terr?‘ic degree of athleticism,
very good size, and an energized
group. They really want to be here,
they’re proud to be here, they’re

‘honored to be here, and they’re
playing like they want to be here.
And you’ve got one or more at
each position, so it gives us great
versatility.

D: At what positions do you see
each of the freshmen?
M: I see Matt Grieser and Chris
Alpert as point guards. I see
Frantisek Babkaas having the abil-
ity to handle the point in certain
situtions, certainly be a shooting
guard, and maybe be in Janko
[Narat}s spot, the swing spot. I see
Jeff Anderson being able to play
the shooting guard as well as the
swing spot. I see Brandon Will-
iams being able to play the 3-spot
[swing forward] and the 4-spot [big
forward] and defensively even the
2-spot [off-guard]. I see Quinn
Harwood in the role of point for-
‘ ward, being able to play 1 [point
guard], 2, 3, or 4 offensively, and
defensively probably 4 and 5 [cen-
ter]. And I would say that Mark
[McGuire] would be primarily a5-
man but you never know. With
Detlef [Musch] or George [Spain]
in the game, he might be able to
play some 4.

D: Who do you see at the point
right now?

M: We’re committed to Jason
Zimmerman. Jason will start at the
point. We have confidence in him.
He’s been a great leader. He has

worked feverishly during the sum- “

mer. I think he’s got the confi-
dence. He certainly should feel the
confidence from us, and in my
mind he’s ready to take on that
role. And he’s not inexperienced
there. He played about six minutes
a game as a freshman at the point.
Last year he played about 10 min-
utes a game at the point. So you’re
putting a junior on the court with
two years starting experience, plus
16 minutes a game point guard
experience. :

D: Last year’s team had a style
that was predicated on aggres-

sive half-court defense and mo-
tion offense. With the influx of
athletic ability in this freshman
class, do you plan to expand that
to a full-court defense and more
fast breaking than you’ve done
in the past?

M: I don’t know that we’re as
athletic across the board, from the
1-spot to the 5-spot, as.we need to
be if we’re going to extend the
court.Sotoextend the court defen-
sively right now is not in our plan.
We will play a very
aggressive half-
court defense.
We'll try to mix it
up a little bit more
than we did in the
past. So we’re go-
ing to try to use in-
telligence as a fac-
tor, as our edge,
much more so than
athleticism on the
defensive end. We :
have reallybecome ~
very sensitive to the
need for us to be-
come aggressive
defensively. So ag-
gression and intel-
ligence will prob-
ably be the twohall-
marks of our de-
fense. At least,
that’s what we’re
working towards.
From an offensive
standpoint, we like
our ability to shoot
the three-pointer
and we like our abil-
ity to score on the .
blocks. What we’d
like to do is run the
break, the primary break, run the
secondary break, shoot the three-
pointer with license. We have
people who can slash to the basket
and we have people who can post
up, SO we’ re going to try to score in
an extraordinary number of ways.
And we hope that the aggressive
and intelligence factors carry over,
so that we’re. going to the foul line
more, we’re not hesitant about
shooting the three, we’re not hési-
tant about going to the hole.

D: One of the things that people
are going to notice first about
this team is that [last year’s start-
ing point guard] Frank Harris
isn’t here. What happened with
him and why is he not back?

M: Frank had a terrific freshman
year for us. He was successful as a
point guard, even though that was
not his position as a high school,
player. But he willingly accepted
that role and did a great job. Frank
and I spoke in March and April of
last year, and we talked about his
comfort at the point spot. He said
he’d like to play the 2-guard spot,
and I saic, ‘That’s fine with me
because that: would be ideal for
you since you are a scorer and you
have a scorer’s mentality.’ I said,
‘You just have to work on your
three-point shooting.’ He worked
extremely hard in March and April
and prior to exams on his three-
point shooting in the gym by him-
self, and seemed committed to re-
ally accepting thatrole, still under-
standing that I would call on him to

play some point as well, to make
him more of a combo guard. He
left here in May at the end of ex-
ams, talked about getting the mes-
sage about Davidson through the
streets of New York, and the vari-
ous playgrounds of New York, and
seemed very excited. I was at the
Southern Conference meetings at
the end of May, and got a call that
Frank had asked to be released
from_his scholarship. And it_was
pretty— not pretty, it was very,

very surprising. After a week or

ye of talking with Frank and try- ’

ng to find out the reasons for his
decision to leave— he didn’t even
say he wanted to leave, he said he

wanted to look around, to shop |

‘around, those were his words, ‘I
want to shop around.’ After two
weeks of this, we spoke almost
every day, Frank said, ‘Coach, I’ve
decided that Davidson is the best
place for me. I’m coming back.
You can trust me.’ I think that was
around June 2, 3, or 4. And we
spoke on a weekly basis from that
conversation in June through out
the whole month of June, and each
time he reassured me he was com-
ing back. Finally, on July 7 or 8
Frank decided he was going to
leave.'I believe the reason for it is
that Frank had a great year. Frank
believes he is a Big East-caliber
player, and Frank wants to get to
play at that level. And in order to
play at that level, it is perhaps his
belief that to concentrate on aca-
demics the way you must concen-
trate on academics here might in-
terfere with that mission— to be a
Big East and eventually NBA
player. And I don’t think he was
willing to sacrifice that, and that’s
why he decided to leave.

D: Does the attrition rate con-
cern you?

M: Obviously, when you lose play-
ers itconcerns you. When you lose
young men whoare very fine young
men itconcerns you. But Davidson
is a challenging’ place academi-

cally, athletically and socially. Not
everyone is custom-designed or fit
to come to Davidson. And when
you’re out recruiting, because of
the recruiting restrictions and limi-
tations, you don’t gettoknow those
players as well as you would like,
not only as players but as people

and as students. So when people -

come here and see the many chal-
lenges that Davidson presents,

“sometimes that, to them, becomes

frustrating. We can go down the
‘players that left.
Franco’ Ferroni
loved it here. That
was no fault of ours,
no decision of ours
that Franco left.
And Franco, to this
day, calls me every
two weeks to see
’ how things are and
tells me how much
he wishes he could
be here.. That was
the NCAA. James
Marsh left because
he was offered a
very attractive pro
contract, and felt
that he could still
continue his educa-
tion in Germany
and play pro bas-
ketball. So I don’t
see that we can re-
ally do anything
about that. That
happens every-
where. Scott Alford
left because he felt
that he was not tal-
ented enough to
play at this level,
and that’s why he’s
at a Division Ii school. And again,
with Scott, Scott felt that the aca-
demic challenges were something
that he was not interested in fol-
lowing through with. Pat Holloway
left because of the social situation
here. It was a very difficult experi-
ence foran urban kid from Denver,
Colorado, and that’s why he left.
And Frank Harris left because he
wanted to play at a higher level of
basketball. We have lost players,
and I suspect every institution goes
through this. Clifford Rozier and
someone else left [North] Carolina
two years ago. Duke lost Christian
Ast, Duke lost Billy McCaffrey,
Duke lost Crawford Palmer. So
schools that are in our neighbor-
hood have lost players as well. But
I think it’s a special kind of stuent
who can succeed here, and some-
times you can’t always gauge that
in a four-time evaluation which
the NCAA restricts us to.

D: What kind of roles do you see
the returning guys filling?

M: Well, every one of them has
had starting experience and min-
utes experience. The primary func-
tion of the veterans has to be to set
the standard defensively. I think
that’s the most difficult aspect of
the transition form high school
basketball to college basketball—
the adjustment to defense. And
however those guys have been able
toadjust has determined their play-
ing minutes. Janko has become a
better defender, Detlefhas become
a better defender, J.D. has become

a better defender, George and
Ronald have become better defend-
ers. They all can score, there’s no
doubt about that, but it’s going to
be primarily a function of how
well they can handle the defensive
responsibilities that will determine
what role they fill.

D: The schedule this year, with
the move to the Southern Con-
ference, is as hard as it’s been
since you’ve been here. You be-
gin with three games [St.
Joseph’s of Maine, Tennessee
Temple, and Lynchburg] that are
much easier than the rest. Give
me your philosophy on that and
your thoughts on the rest of the
schedule: ©

M: The NCAA has mandated that
we start November 1, which im-

_mediately knocks out two weeks

of practice time. So we’re con-
stricted now from a six-week pro-
gram toa four-week process. When
you bring seven new faces on
board, the learning process is some-

‘ what slow. You have to go slower,

you have to spend some time on
some things that the veterans have
already picked up. Our sense was
that we cannot afford to, on De-
cember 2, play a Big East team or
an ACC team, or a Southeastern
Conference team.. We needed to
get our veterans some confidence.
They’re coming off winning four
of their last five games, still ques-
tioning whether or not they can be
successful, but now having the
experience and perhaps the confi-
dence of maybe pushing them-
selves into that barrier where they
believe they can be winners. And
we had to get our freshmen as
much experience as possible. So
for the combination of confidence
and experience, we decided that,
let’s take those first two weeks of
December, and see if we could
provide an experience that’s going
to allow us to use freshmen plus
build our veterans’ confidence.
And that’s why we did not play the
Big East teams or the ACC teams,
the so-called marquee teams, early
in that December time period. It’s
a chance for us to experiment, to
get our feet wet, and to see if the
decision we’ve made with shoot-
ing the three-pointer is the one that
we’d. like to be able maintain
throughout the year.

D: The. consensus among pre-
season polls and magazines has
been that Davidson will finish
deep in the second division of the
conference, Obviously, the
Southern Conference is a step
up from the Big South. What do
you expect from the Southern
this year?

M: We welcome the opportunity
to be an underdog. I respond when
people tell me that we’re not good
enough or we can’t do it. I like that
challenge. The mediaand so-called
experts and even the coaches in the
conference that picked us ninth or
tenth in the various polls pick us
based upon our previous perfor-
mance, and our previous perfor-
mance indicates that we would
struggle in the Southern Confer-
ence. Yet, I think there are some
