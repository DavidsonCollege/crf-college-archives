On Monday hight, September 8, the Fresh-

tration, and other officers connected with the
college. Refreshments, which consisted of
cream, cake, and punch, were served by
young ladies of the town. The hall was
tastefully and adroitly decorated in red and
black.

his wholehearted work it was considered
a success. It is fitting that since the “Y”
first welcomed the new men to Davidson

that the same organization should give them
their first taste of social life on the campus.
Carl Pritchett was given assistance by Mrs!
F. W. Hengeveld and the “Y” Cabinet.
Mrs. Hengeveld has offered her services be-
fore for other receptions, and it is due large-
ly to her advice and work that this recep-
tion, as well as those in the past, ran smooth-

ly. The work of preparing this reception

Although the “Y” has falien this oppor-
tunity to get the class together, it
intended that this is the last time the class |
will meet. Periodically, small groups will |
meet in the “
each other and to learn the campus leaders

and outstanding men on the hill as well as |

others who are interested in them.

The Y. M. C. A. has always directed per-
sonal attention to Freshmen, and it has been
proven again this year that its services ac-
count for the friendly. feeling on the David-
son campus to a large extent.

Coaching Staff is
Enlarged This Year

J. W. Unger, of West Point, Miss.,
’ football star and heavyweight wrestler, has
been added this year to the Davidson coach-
ing staff. He comes to Davidson highly rec-
ommended by Z. G. Clevenger, head coach
of the University of Indiana. Unger first
went to the University of Mississippi, where
he played tackle on the varsity eleven and
was on the baseball nine as well.

Later on at the University of Indiana he
was considered one of the best heavyweight
wrestlers in the Western Conference. At
present most of Unger’s time here will be
Mevoted to coaching the linesmen of the
“Fresh football squad.

After the football season is over, he will
act in the position of head wrestling coach.

Having taken courses in physical educa-
tion at the University of Indiana, Unger is
well equipped to take over these duties as
well as offer valuable assistance in other
phases of athletics throughout the year. His
experience, “however, in the line of wrestling
and football will very probably warrant his

Student Directory

The Davidsonian, according to
its custom, plans to publish at an
early date a complete direcory of
all students. Because of the usual

as well as the late registration of a
few students, a correct directory

cannot be published in this issue.

Registration

Last Monday a report from the
registrar's office gave Davidson an
enrollment for the first semester of
610. A few more were expected to
register within a day or two. For
the first semester last year only 603
were enrolled. Although small, the
administration is pleased with the
increase, considering the economic
depression of a year’s duration. At
this early date no statistical reports,
such as number of state represented,
number in each class, etc., are avail-
able.
