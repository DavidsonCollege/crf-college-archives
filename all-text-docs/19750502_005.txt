Like most aspiring young scholars I
was deeply saddened to see Hatties
lying in the charcoaled ruins of a suc-
cessful arson. ;

Hatties: was to the thirsty Davidson
student as Berlin was to Jesse Owens.

_ and now that the tap has been tapped

and bought for-the last time. where does
the erudite guzzler go+on Thursday
nights? .Hatties. or Hattis (long i,
please), positioned itself into almost

_ evervone’s schedule.

I've known some who considered the
pilgrimage on Thursday night as a
fourth course.

Hatties let her hair down to Davidson
men for years, and when she changed
hands, the new owner, Larry, showed
and displayed the same _ hospitality.

enhanced by a remodeling job.

But now, God rest her soul, Hatties
has become just another piedmont
social legend, like fraternities. Her pin-
ball machines, bathrooms (7), pool
table, and juke box all lie asphyxiated.

There will be no more Thursday night
get-aways from E.H., no more innocent
gooses in a crowd of I don’t know how
many, no more losing count of your date
or pitchers drunk, no more acceptable
Friday morning 9:00 a.m. excuses, and
no more having your car towed from an
ecumenical fair ground parking lot.

Someone, I guess, had a gripe with
someone connected with Hatties.
Someone was too sensitive to take the in-
sults, the incidentals, the perjorative
kidding.

Revelation shows course of the future

I had a dream the other day. I was
down in my wine cellar gazing at the
stars on the fdbel of some vintage
cognac when a delegation knocked on
my door.

Now in my dream I am 86 years old
and it takes me a while to get up the
stairs. My wife had seated the
educators in the library.

“Old man, we are ready for you. We
want you to teach that course on the
future.”’

“But I_ proposed that course decades
ago in the 1970s.”’

‘“‘Well, we had to be sure you knew
what you were talking about.”’

I accepted and they left. Then I went
over to that okdest part of my home
which then was pushing toward the
beginning of its fourth century. In anold
desk I found a course outline written on
legal paper with a ballpoint.

“This is a course on the future but sin-
ce you live today your first concern will

be how do you get your grade. The Final
Exam will be worth 100 percent of your
grade. ,
“Our discussions. will cover many
areas and will get increasingly difficult.
Among the topics to be discussed are:
Investigating plant communism and the
philosophy of plants, Can existence be
inter-dimensional, Concerns related to
suicide when it is the only way to die,
How do we reduce our faith in
rationality by 25%, why most Christians
underestimate Christ’s intelligence or
would the insights in the sermon on the
mount have been had by anyone with an
1.Q. of 42, who are ‘‘they,”’ who am I,
how many feelings do I have at one
time?
“The Final Exam will be make up of
three questions, y6y will ‘supply the
three questions. No ‘answers are
. necessary. The easier the questions can
be answered the less valuable will the
questions be.”’

There was more but my eyes went to
the responses, written at the bottom,
from the universities and colleges to
whom I had submitted by proposal.

“We do not accept proposals which
are not typed.”’

“We are studying your proposal and
will contact you in the near future.”’

“‘We are sorry to reject your course.
Our goals are to develop intelligent.
well rounded individuals--you ‘have
perhaps confused wisdom with in-
telligence.”’

‘«.Under your cloak of academic
credentials lies a mystic. Mysticism
leaves flat spots on well rounded
people.’’

My dream revealed one thing I had
not thought about occuring in the future.
The people in the dream had no legs.
They were so well rounded they just
rolled along. You know, I think I could
have predicted that with a closer look at
the 1970s.

-Hatties’ fire emblazons memories

And who really buys this round? Well.
Larry will financially, but every David-
son student who went to Hatties. regar-
dless of the day or hour. to share in
something will buy it. But that’s just the
shortcomings of alcohol, not Hatties.
There will be. as time move on, other
“Hatties.”’

And as long as the Anchor Grill watch-
es its step, the F.A.C. will keep bombing
those trains with beer cans. Most
of our cozy get-aways are being pil-
laged. Davidson is unique; it has. its
own ‘‘domino theory.”

_ I wish, just wish, that a Davidson
student had burned Hatties, because
then, with the note he would have left,
we could pose the immortal. question:
‘“‘Why did you do it?”’

Some endobiotic slob will be cooling
his heels on Thursday night with a smug
of beer (sorry about that!).

My suggestion is a combination of
Harry Truman and an old Salem com-
mercial: ‘You can take the Davidson
student out of Hatties, but you can’t take
Hatties out of the Davidson student:

“See you all in front of Hatties, six
pack in hand, on Thursday night. Why
ruin a tradition, much less a foreign
policy?”’

Integrity shortage burdens leadership

This period of time is one of shortages.
There seems to have been a shortage of
everything from toilet paper to sugar.
Davidson College has not been spared,
either.

We have a housing shortage, a shor-
tage of eating facilities, of gym time and
of money to provide badly needed new
educational facilities.

More critically this college has one ad- '

ditional shortage; one of leadership in-
tegrity.

In the past weeks this shortage has
become abundantly clear. Take the
Goals Committee, for example. The
trustees’ presented the college com-
munity with a much needed committee
formed to set college priorities for the
next ten years.

Immediately, the appointments to the
Committee insured that the Committee
would have no independent rolé’ what-
soever. Sam Spencer, Craven Williams,
Will Terry, Grover Meetze, Jack Bevan
and Warner Hall were participating
members of the committee.

Silent committee

Mark Deaton and John Munce were
appointed. These people, by view of
position, have automatic input into any
decisions made at Davidson.

Why then; put them on the com-
mittee? Simple. Calling the in-crowd a
committee, especially a trustee-faculty-
administration-student committee, lent
credence to whatever actions these
people were planning to take.

With Spencer and Hall dominating the
committee, no chance was provided for,
real discussion. The weight of the boss’
statement tends to dominate that of the
workers’. That’s exactly what happened.

. First, Spencer gave the committee the
royal shaft. The members spent an en-
tire meeting discussing the Carnegie
Building. Spencer knew all the time that
a unilateral decision of his-had' already

Vark Wilensky

turned the building into a guest house.
He sat mute.

When faculty representative Kaylor
complained at the next meeting, Spen-
cer was his usual patronizing self. ‘‘No
Dave,”’ he explained, “‘there won’t be
another situation like this one. From
now on all such decisions will go through
the Goals Committee.”’

No explanation as to why he’d wasted
the committee’s time, other than ‘‘the
decision needed to be made im-
mediately”’ was given.

Unrealistic charge

Dr. Spencer, why weren’t you honest

‘with the committee? Why not have the ~

integrity to tell the truth from the
start? Why maké a behind-the-back
decision and then fail to present it to the
group analyzing the situation you just
decided?

At ‘last .week’s Open End, Craven

' Williams ‘explained that it. wasn’t the

* members’ fault that the Committee

hadn’t functioned in an intelligent man-
ner. He explained that the Committee
had to follow the trustee charge, even
though the members realized the charge
was an unrealistic one.

Integrity

Craven is a decent man in an indecent
situation. He was trying to be honest and
explain why ‘the committee hadn’t
worked. But he’d go no further.

I explained to him that the Goals Com-
mittee is still a committee, and in fact
the members could take its report
wherever they felt it should go. Craven
backed off.

Neither he nor anyone else at the Open
End was willing to take the step and say
‘‘we are suppossed to set goals, lets do it
the right way, not the Trustee way.”’
That kind of integrity wasn’t voiced.

Needless to say, this abdication of
responsibility of the Goals Committee
upset ‘me no little bit. I was walking
towards Chambers with the Mench, ex-
pressing my displeasure; loudly, as is
my cussed practice.

Spencer

“Tt’s all Spencer, Mench,” I ‘ex-

plained. ‘‘People like Craven are afraid

to think for themselves. The Craven’sand
the Bob Stephenson’ s show up and take
the rap, while he is in the background.

Everyone is afraid to think or act in-
dependently for fear that Spencer will
lower the boom. And Spencer would
lower the boom...’’

At that time I saw a look of terror
come 'to Mench’s face. I looked to the
left, and there, not ten feet away, in
white shorts. and orange tennis shirt,
leaving the library with his son, was the
subject of my tirade.

‘“‘Mench. there he is.”’ I velled.

“Dr. Spencer, could you please stop

. and talk a minute,’ I said.

Now as anyone who’s ever
caught talking behind someone’s ink
can attest, I was embarrassed.

Not for what I'd said, to the contrary;
I’ve expressed these views often in
public. I just felt that I should talk to his
face, not his back. So I lowered my voice
and explained my position.

“Dr. Spencer,” I began, ‘“‘I really hope
you’ll go over to the Open End. The
Goals Committee is saying that it has
given up, and questions are being asked
that only you can answer. People are
becoming upset.”’

Leadership crisis

“Oh yeah?”’ Spencer questioned.

“Yes,” I continued. ‘It’s a really bad
situation. The students. were told that
this committee was an important one
and are now being told it is a farce. I
really feel that you need to be there.”

“Well, that’s too bad,” Spencer said.
He turned on his heel and _ walked
straight to his white-fenced house. not
2h ie from the scene of the Open

n

It is too bad. Our leadership is not at
all responsive to anyone but themselves.
There’s nowhere else to go, either.

The Trustees explain that they are
rarely on campus, and depend on Spen-
cer to ‘keep them posted. How many em-
ployees give their boss a bad report on
themselves? Sam Spencer is a lot of
things, but dumb he is not.

It’s a vicious circle, with the students
trapped inside.
