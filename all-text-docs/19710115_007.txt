the Wildcat baseball pro-
“gram. Stevens, in his tenth
season at the Davidson
helm, went over the 100 win
plateau. last spring.

R. Winston Spikes, who
presented tthe keys, called
Stevens a ‘‘great sportsman,
an inspiration to all of: the
players he has coached. His
record speaks for itself. I
can't think of anyone who
has done more for Davidson
and, Southern Conference
baseball in general than this
man right here (Stevens).”

After expressing his
thanks, Stevens offered his
own comments. ‘‘We've ~al-
ways been real optimistic

about the program here. at
Davidson. With a little luck
we could go all the way this
year. If we can just put it
all together, we can have
a fine ballclub.

“We should be contenders.
But at Davidson we do have
a problem competing with
all of the subsidzed teams;
we don't have any scholar-
ships at all and it makes it
tough to compete.”

Immediately after the
meet Stevens was seen talk-
ing with Maryland officials.

Coach Terry Holland an-
nounced at a_press- confer-
ence Jan. 12 that the site of
the DavidsonSouth Carolina
basketball game has been
moved from the
Coliseum to Johnston Gym
here at Davidson,

The reason for the rash
change in the location was
due to a mix-up in bookings
for. the Coliseum, Holland
said,

“Somewhere the bookings
got. crossed up,’ he com
mented, “‘and we were
scheduled to play the same
hight the Ringling Brothers
Barnum and Bailey Circus
. Was to open.” /

Holland said he received
notice of the change from
the Coliseum Director Sun-
day afternoon.

“I’ve already conferred
with South Carolina's coach
frank MeGuire and we both
agree that there is nothing
else to do,” Holland smirk-
ed, “‘we will have to play it
out here.”’

Bo Brickets the
assistant

Wildcat's
coach, was elat-
ed over the location change.

“We haven't a game
in seven years in Johnston
Gyng, and I feel sufe that
no one will see this as any

start a prece-
stated,

lost

chance to
dent,”’ he

“There's: room for the en-

o Move,

May Take Green Bay Post

Former Davidson head

. football coach Homer Smith

is rumored to be on the
move again and the latest
move might be to the big-
gest post Smith has held.

The Green Bay Packers of
the National Conference of
the NFL are rumored to

-have marrowed the choice

for-a replacement for Phil
‘Bengston to three top col-
lege coaches, Smith, Joe
Paterno of Penn State and
Ohio State’s W. W. Hayes._

(Packer officials have indi-
cated that the announcement
of .a new coach is imminent
since the Green Bay club
wants to have the coach
briefed on his personnel be-
fore the ahnual draft of col-
lege football talent.

Packer brass have _ been
drawn to the three because
of. the success they have had
wth their offensive teams in
the past several seasons.

‘Although Hayes, Paterno
and Smith have different
theories on how to run a
successful offense and have
quite different concepts of
how the defensive~ team
shéuld ‘be organized, we feel
that all of them can enrich
the Packer team. and the
NFL in general,’ a Green
Bay spokesman commented.

“As far as Smith is con-
cerned, we have high opin-
ion of his talents. After his
experience’ at Davidson, we
are convinced that he can

_ speaking engagements,

. As’

recruit men who will meet
the entrance requirements
here. It sure%is exciting to
watch that ball fly through
the air.”

Although Smith ; was not
available for comment due
to a heavy’ schedule — of
Pat-
erno and ‘Hayes both made
statements to the press.

“As far as I’m concerned
Paterno and Smith can have
the job,"’ said Hayes. ‘‘Three
yards and a cloud of dust
is the only way I want to
play football. I wouldn't fit
in at Green Bay. It gets, so
cold there that the ground
freezes. Can't get any dust
at all that way.”

Paterno also seemed dis-
interested in the Packer

post.

“T like Penn State," stat-
ed the Niltany Lion chief.
“Green Bay isn't even cligi
ble for the Lambert trophy.
far as I'm concerned
Hayes and Smith can have

the job.”

Several Packer — players
have expressed the hope -
that Smith would be the

head man. ‘“The man really
impressed me when LI talk-
ed with him, he seemed to
be a swell guy."’ said one
man

Charlotte -

tire Davidson .student body
in Johnston Gym, and if the
students remember’ what
happened at Maryland, I'm
sure the game will be, uh,
exciting,’’ he snickered.

Brickles said this was a
chance for ‘worthwhile stu-
dent activity."

The Gamecocks of USC
dropped in the national rank-
ings after two quick upsets,
and. Holland foresees the
Davidson game as a ‘‘chance
to eliminate them as con-
tenders altogether."

“The place will be of tre-
mendous psychological ad-
vantage to the ‘Cats,"’ he
said.

In an effort to make up for
the loss of the Coliseum, the
Ringling Brothers Circus of-
fered to lend three elephants
and a tiger to the school for
the halftime show.

“We were forced to turn
down their kind offer,’ Brick-
els said, ‘because a_ show
like that would interfere
‘with the fine entertainment
we get from our cheerlead-
ers,”

Crowd control was fore-
seen as a problem for the
game, but the coaches feel
they have it well in hand.

According to. Holland,
seats will be held for David-
son students until 3 p.m.

“In case anyone can't get
in to see the game, we will
have closed circuit televi-
sion set up in Love Auditor
ium, ~ Perkins Auditorium,
and the Honors College,”
Brickels said.

Holland denied rumors
that fear of fighting led to
the changing of ithe location
of the game, but did say
that a ‘certified boxing ref"
will be employed for the
game.

All Davidson team mem-
bers will wear fencing
masks during the game.
