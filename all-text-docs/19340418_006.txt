THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 18, 1934

Davidson Trackmen In
V. P. I. Meets Saturday

The varsity and freshman track
teams will leave Friday morning to
participate in meets Saturday with V.
P. I. Fourteen freshmen and 22 var-
sity men will make the trip.

Coach Whittle stated that the V. P. I.
varsity tearh is very strong this year,
although they were defeated 66-61 by
the W. & L. cindermen. The V, P. I.
first-year team is the best they have
ever had, Whittle said. Ten of their
freshmen were entered in the Carolina
indoor meet, and they showed up un-
usually well in the sprints and the
hurdles. Y

The meet will be started as early as
possible Saturday so that the Wildcats
and 'Kittens will be back in Davidson
by twelve that night.

It is hoped that all the regulars will
be able to make this trip.

Beaver Club Abolished
By Leadership Society

The Beaver Club, honorary sopho-
more society and junior order of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, was abolished by
the latter organization at a meeting
of its members last Monday night.
The action taken by O. D. K. came as
no surprise, as this step has been con-
sidered for some time, Lack of func-
tion and purpose of the Beaver Club,
it was said, were the reasons for its
abolishment.

Formerly its members were chosen
from the rising Sophomore class on
merit of their participation in campus
activities, and its main function was
to promote good relations with visit-
ing athletic teams which come here
from time to time by assisting in ex-
tending them every possible courtesy.
As the “D” Club now functions in
that capacity and has been doing it
for some time, the Beaver Club was
left without any definite purpose of
activity,

The step taken by O. D. K. was
passed upon by a unanimous vote of
its members.

FURMAN PRESIDENT
MAKES CHIEF TALK

tional lives, homes, schools
churches.”

“However, I shall dare to say,” de-
clared Dr. Geer, “in these confusing
times that there has been nothing new
and terrifying, that we shall surely
and unerringly move into new and
higher fields of life. The trouble with
our nation is that our faith is in
eclipse, faith in divine institutions and
in divine intelligence.” Concluding his
talk, he stated: “With the return of
faith, justified confidence, we _ shall
again move forward.”

Dr. Geer, prominent in business 20
years before becoming a college presi-
dent, was introduced by Dr, Walter
L. Lingle, president of Davidson Col-
lege, who briefly discussed the plans
for'the enlargement of building facili-
ties and endowment by the time of
the centennial celebration, coming in
1937,

Dean J. M. MacConnell discussed the
early years of Davidson and told of
the founders, “whose lives and ideals
are still exemplified at Davidson.’
“The job of founding,” declared Dr.
MacConnell, “has been done. It now
remains for us, the builders, to carry
the ideals of the founders still further
and higher.”

and

Sharing the spotlight with the cele-
bration of first Founders’ Day at Da-
vidson was the publication of the first
Alumni Magazine, which included some
of the features mentioned in the
Founders’ Day program.

The glee club rendered “Let Every
Tongue Adore Thee,” by Bach, on the
morning program, and the Davidson
Concert Band gave a short concert in
the afternoon. Among the visitors of
the day was Col. E. L. Baxter David-
son, a descendant_of the-Davidsons_for

whom the college was named.

Grimes opposed Brown in the run-off

Brown received the majority.

ALPHA PHI EPSILON

bama in 1918, and Phi Chapter was

vidson: Dr. J. M. McConnell, Dr. T.

FIRING AT RANDOM

(Continued from page 4)
feat. Since school reopened these boys
have encountered four other foes and
their equal hasn’t been on the courts
with them yet. Captain Jimmy Hal-
verstadt, who has lost only one match
this season, and that to Billy Reese,
holder of several titles, now No. 1 at
Georgia Tech, is the best bet to. win
the singles title at the state tournament

which is to be staged on the Univer-

‘went to the Davidson team, this prov-’

sity of North Carolina courts at Chapel
Hill Thursday, Friday and Saturday of
this week. Halverstadt and Lafferty
as a doubles team will be pushing some
pair for that crown, too, This duet
won the southern prep school cham-
pionship in 4930, and it wouldn’t sur-
prise me to see them bring back a
cup apiece from the North Carolina
play-off this week-end. All of our boys
should do themselves credit in this
tourney, and, as has been said before,
“We'll be wishing for them good suc-
cess.”

The golf team opened.its season
last Thursday with Furman, who
in turn licked the ’Cats, but they
came through to outplay their op-
ponents from U. S. C. on the next
afternoon, defeating them without
great difficulty.

It will no doubt be of interest to
those who play a great deal of golf to
know that the local course is being
enlarged. Just how many holes are
being added I am unable to say, but
the ground across the road from the
fourth green is being graded, and it
looks as if three or four more fairways
could be gotten in there.

Pole vaulting in the Tennessee
meet at Knoxville Saturday, John
Lee, sophomore members of the
track team, cleared 12 feet on his
fourth try. This is six inches above
the present school record, and John
will no doubt make it officially be-
fore the season ends.

tonia’s five. Numerous errors on Da-
vidson’s part and failure to hit at the
right time allowed Gastonia to run up
a lead that cost them the game. Gracey
pitched the entire game for Davidson.

Shemwell and Arrowood hit well in

all three games and Quick stood out
in the Wingate game, the only game
in which he was able to play.
