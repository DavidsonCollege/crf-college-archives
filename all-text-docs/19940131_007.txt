New Union board includes 0

By Rachel Dunifon and
Mandy Curtis

After several candidates
dropped out of the election, Nat
May, Phoebe Dean and Rosie
Molinary will take over the col-
lege Union board.

Junior May will be the new
president, while junior Phoebe
Dean will be the co-curricular vice-
president and sophomore Rosie
Molinary will act as social vice-
president.

According to current Union
President Merrill Earnest, the
Union’s new leaders have the op-
portunity “to determine the direc-
tion of the Union.”

With a greater number of
Davidson students remaining so-
cially independent, Earnest says,
the Union must ensure that it con-
tinues to work to meet the needs of
Davidson’s changing student body.

The Union’s night manager,
Meg Jones, explains that the co-
curricular council of the Union
coordinates events such as solidar-
ity week, artist series, cultural
events, literary arts, and speakers.
The social council focuses on
Davidson’s big weekends, such as
Midwinters, as well as concerts
and other performances.

May, who ran uncontested for
the presidency, hopes to find a
board as good as the existing board
for the '93 year. "We want to get a
good diverse group of people," he
says.

As president, May plans to

WIRE

continue the many programs that
started this past year. May hopes
to also "bring the Union down the
hill" by creating an Outpost com-

_ mittee.

Says May: "I think people are
starting to see the Union as a more
visible aspect; as something en-
joyable. I hope we can use the
Union to bring faculty, staff and
students together in a place where
they can interact comfortably in a
non-academic setting."

‘ Phoebe Dean agrees with May
in that they are looking "to estab-
lish a really good Union board for
the coming year."

According to Dean, the Union
board would like to continue the
co-sponsored events with the SGA

‘and Patterson Court.

Dean says, "I'd like to make
the programs more accessible and
appealing to a larger percentage of
the student body." .

Other offices facing re-elec-
tion are those of defense advisor
and student solicitor. Candidates
for each of these offices are rising
seniors, must run as a pair, and are
not permitted to campaign for elec-
tion.

Candidates for defense advi-
sor are: Matt Hunoval and Lorie
Logan, Marty O’Brien and Malloy
Evans, Geoff Graham and Alan
Stump, Scott Hile and Catherine
Grimmell, Ashlyn Dannelly and
Andrea Short, and Phil Lisi and
Andrew Smitherman. Candidates
for student solicitor are: Arthur

Panel probes
academy cheating

ANNAPOLIS, MD (CPS)--
Three retired admirals will inves-
tigate a cheating scandal at. the
U.S. Naval Academy that could
involve a large number of disci-
plinary cases against graduating
seniors.

A year-long investigation
found that some midshipmen had
advance access to an electrical
engineering test that was admin-
istered to 700 students on De-
cember 14, 1992.

“We don’t know the num-
bers or how the exam was com-
prised,” said Naval Academy
spokeswoman Karen Myers. “We
expect there to be a significant
number of students. They are all
graduating seniors, and we are
working on a process to hear all
the cases to determine if indi-
viduals did commit a violation.”

Three retired flag officers are
on the review panel, and they will
examine files on all the cases and
recommend how they should be
handled. If violations are not too
serious, they can recommend
some punishment short of dis-
missal. In more serious cases,
students could face criminal
charges and expulsion.

The New YorkTimes reported
in early January that 125 mid-
shipmen will be implicated, but
Officials at the Naval Academy
could not verify that number. An
initial investigation last year listed
28 midshipmen who had access

to the exam, and all but six were
cleared. However, on May 3, a
student brought new information
to academy officials indicating the
“possibility of more honor code
violations in the compromise,” an
academy news release said.

Minorities majority
at Cal State

HAYWARD, CA (CPS)--A’
majority of minority students now
make up the student body at Cali-
fornia State Hayward, campus of-
ficials said.

For the first time, 51.4 per-
cent of the student body repre-
sents ethnic minorities, and 48.6
percent of the students are Cauca-
sian. The largest ethnic group is
Asian/Filipino/Pacific Islander at
25.3 percent, followed by African
American at 12.3 percent and
Chicano/Latino/Hispanic at 10}
percent. The remaining 3.8 per-
cent are Native American and
other minorities.

“It is gratifying to see the
efforts of the Affirmative Action
office resulting in increased re-
tention of minority students,” said]
Albert Camacho, assistant direc-
tor ofthe university’s Affirmative
Action office. “The college expe-
rience is greatly enhanced when
the student body is diverse.”

In 1984, 36.5 percent of the
total enrollment were minority stu-
dents. Women now make up 61
percent of the campus, and the
average age of students is 26, the
university reported.

According to Honor Council
Secretary Sally Stone, both the stu-
dent solicitors and defense advi-
sors “work together to uphold the
Honor Code.” The student solici-
tors do this by investigating pos-
sible Honor Code violations and

presenting their findings to the
Dean of Students, who determines |
whether or not a trial is necessary.
When a violation does lead to
a trial, the defense advisors work
with the defendant to uphold his or
her position and to ensure that a
fair trial occurs. The new Honor
Council chair and secretary will be

elected in April in a vote by the
entire Council.

Students may vote for SGA
president and vice president and
Honor Council members from 9
a.m.to3 p.m. on Tuesday in Cham-
bers or the Union.

Run-offs will be at the same
times on Wednesday.

“There is no reason we can’t move forward...”

beliefs should be believed, no one

person can make that decision. So
as president, it would be important
to hear all the voices on campus.
There is no reason why we can’t
move forward and embrace other
people, while at the same time cher-
ishing the very roots the school
was founded on.”

What is your stand on the pro-
posed changes of the Statement
of Purpose and the policy re-
quiring that Trustees be Chris-
tian? If elected how would you
address these issues?

“I cannot say how I would
address issues at this time, because
as we speak I’m going around to all
the students and asking them these
types of questions, asking what
concerns they have. This book
right here [he holds up notebook]
has several students all around the
dorms, their opinions on these types
of issues,

“That’s not to say that I’m
going to act as a robot and do what
51% of the students want. Again,
I know what I want, and that is a
more diverse student body, a more
diverse faculty which I think we
have, anda diverse Trustee organi-
zation because if the Trustees are
making policy that affects student
life but the student life and the
students do not directly reflect the
makeup ofthe Trustees, then I don’t
see how those decisions pertain to
those students.

“So if we’re looking at very
important decisions that the Trust-
ees are making, we have to take
into account all those students
whose voices may not be heard
because they are not Christian. I
believe that is very important that
if I’m going to take a compromis-

ing stand on this right now, this is
the stand I have. It’s that there
should be a minimum number of
Trustees who aren’t Christian, I
would say roughly 50% or 30%—
that number can be debated but I
feel there should be always ties to
the Christian church. I would not
like to see a total revamping of the
Trustees where the Christian stu-
dents and Christians all around

campus feel that their rights are

being infringed upon. At the same

time, there are many students

whose voices aren’t being heard,

whose religions may be embraced

in one sense, but are not particu-

larly recognized and understood in

another sense.

“There are many alumni
who’ve graduated who are non-
Christians and would probably
make very good Trustees and to
say otherwise would be close-
minded. In that sense, there should
be a movement toward making the
Trustees more diverse of a body
because it reflects the students and
there should be a need to address
the Statement of Purpose and find
a way to make it more embracing
of the structure we now have, rather
than the structure we once had
when it was created.”

What do you predict will be
Davidson’s biggest challenge in
1994?

“T’d say not only in 1994, but
for as long as we’re alive, it’s re-
spect among the administration and
faculty. Sometimes I feel we’re
being treated like children and not
like young adults. Some of us act
like children; I’m no exception.
Butsometimes there has to be more
communication and there has to be
more understanding. Faculty mem-
bers need to know where to draw
the line as faras getting involved in

student life. I’ve made an effort
this year to bring faculty members
down to my fraternity and have
them eat. They’ve been very sur-
prised that it wasn’t a beat up old
house with garbage everywhere
and rowdy students looking to
break things and act like animals.
Everyone was very civilized and
we had good food. I got a thank
you note from one of those faculty
members. It was the first time
she’d ever been invited down and
she had a better time than she ever
expected. Those types of contacts
that we make with the administra-
tors and the faculty members are
so essential for them to understand
what it is the students are and want.
Wecan’tentirely convey that mes-
sage in words; we have to do it
through deeds. There has to be a
lot more interaction on an equal
plain with these people so that next
time, when we come back from a
break and we find out that the
sports complex has done some
changing, that we don’t feel we’ve
been in the dark about it until our
lives have already been changed as
well. We have to be taken into
account whenever something in
this school happens.

“T don’t feel that’s been done
enough. I feel many times students
just go with the flow and follow
what they’ve been told to do, all
the while, knowing that it’s not
right, just not knowing how to
change it. Once we sit down it will
take time, but I hope that my ad-
ministration will be the first all out
effort to establish that commonal-
ity between the students and the
faculty, the Trustees, the adminis-
trators.

“So we all feel like, on some
level, on the level of moving this
school forward, that we’re all on
the same plain.”
