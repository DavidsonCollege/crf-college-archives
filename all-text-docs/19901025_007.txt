D.A. Thompson | Rude Notes & Random Scribblings
Suck Back a Cold One and
Raise Your Awareness

Yes, indeed, it’s that time of
year again. Thelcavesareturning,
a chill has come oyer the air, and
the Carolinian clay has started to
turn into that runny red mud that
won’t go away until sometime in
July. While these emblems of au-
tumn have always warmed my
heart, there is a new placard of the
period of which Iam even more
deeply fond, Alcohol Awareness
Week. I’ve been begging for some-
thing like this little fiesta to be
instituted since my freshman year:
an entire week dedicated solely to
the celebration of intoxicating
beverages.

Davidson College is in desper-
ate need of such an event. Sure we
-have plenty of alcohol on campus
already, but do we really appreci-
ate it? Are we truly aware of it’s
capabilities? Do we treat it with
the respect and honor it deserves?
I think riot. All too often we see
alcohol abused and mistreated on
Patterson Court.

How many times have I seen
careless and irresponsible 21 year
olds try to carry up too many beers
at once, and then sacrilegiously
spill them.all over the stairs? How
many times have I seen freshmen
struggle through the crowds to get
themselves.a cup of that delight-
fully warm Busch, only to drop it

latest hip hop rap ¢rap?
How ay times ey Isuffer-

red to hear people tell me that they
don’t-even-drink? -¢Alarmingly
enough, there are several students
at Davidson who actually use the
alternative beverages for some-
thing other than a mixer.) This
abstinence and ignorance is abso-
lutely absurd. We cannot permit
these atrocities to exist any longer
at our beloved institution of self
abuse.

That’s why we need Alcohol

Awareness Week, a fun filled se-
ries of seven days which all are
sure to enjoy. Just look at these
action packed events: Sunday - a
discussion of the finer things,
Makers Mark, Wild Turkey 101,
and Jagermiester. This forum will
be followed by a panel discussion

of the 1991 sports cars and which -

of these liquors best accompanies
these little crash and burn and die
too young deathtraps..

Monday - Pub Night! Steven
Lilly leads you into the Korner.
Don’t worry if you’re not old

~enougirto-enter; freshmen; some-_

body (?) is sure to get you a beer.
Tuesday -Will Keim speaks

on Balcony Urination Techniques
and will-answer-questions_about
his trip to the Grand Canyon.

Wednesday - Over the Hump
on Patterson Court. Forget your
work and bag that 8:15, come get
butt-wasted instead!

Thursday - The weekend ap-

proaches. Prepare for it properly at _

the “Puking With Grace” seminar,
hosted by Mark Swofford.

Friday through Sunday - No
need to bother with scheduled
events here. You’ ve had all week
to get ready and it’s time to fly
solo! We recommend, however,
continuous intoxication resulting
from the steady intake of undiluted
grainalcohol. Remember, too, not
to miss the Helms rallies while
you’re in this most inibriated state,
Jesse’s fans just love loudmouth
liberal college kids at their parties,
especially if they’re naked and rip
roarin’ hammered! (If you’ re gonna
go, why notin style, eh?)

Yes, I am most certainly look-
ing forward to Alcohol Awareness
Weck. I’m sure it'll be just as
successful as Greek Week was to
the promotion of mature and rea-
sonable consumption around here.
But let’s not forget about the fu-
ture, folks. Break out your bongs
and your bell bottoms because
rumor hasitthat there’s going to be
a Most Mellow’ and Meaningful
Marijuana Meeting Month some-
time in the spring.

nalism, and I almost learned too
late. Too late for a lot of people,
the least of which myself.l This
week, I was going to use my little
allotment of newsprint to rip the
Faculty Executive Committee to
shreds for the much debated aca-
demic calendar which has been
proposed forthe 1992-93 academic _
year.

BUT, at the last minute (and
I’m not kidding when I say that), I
learned that my sources were, in
fact, very much mistaken about —
some of the information they had
passed on to me. To whom did I
speak? Well, relax for a minute,
and I'll tell you.

Before I had read the S.G.A.
minutes regarding the goings on at
their most recent meetings, I had
been informed that the Faculty
Executive Committee had pro-
posed and passed the changes that
we are all so upset about. Campus

commentary about the subject has

“And 1, for one, ate up all the rheto-
ric blaming specific faculty mem-
bers and the committees behind
them. We all did.

The scary thing is my sources
were pretty credible. They were
(I’mnotgonnatell the names, silly,

that’s my whole point!!!) mem-
_ bers of the S.G.A. and people who

are pretty close to the organiza-

tion. I’m not blaming them, nor

am I calling them liars, They’re
not. They simply passed on misin-
formation. The problem is not that

they were just making stuff up,

‘cause they weren’t. They just
weren’t really aware of the entire
situation surrounding the Aca-

demic calendar changes, just parts -

of it. ;

So is there really any blame to
be placed? Yes. There are a great
deal of things wrong, I believe,
with acalendar that raises somuch
angst amongst the student body

that will bear the sei adh it. There

members of any organization, be it
the S.G.A. or any other, who pass
on half-truths and partial facts.
When someone is in a position of
respect, like the S.G.A., what they
say can have a great deal of effect.
However, when that respect is

misused, or the responsibility that -

accompanies respect is ignored,

“then what the S.G.A. member in ~

question says can be harmful, or
even destructive.

My advice? Scrap the pone
dar and give us our extra exam
days back. (This is the opinions
section, afterall.) All Davidsonian
writers should double, even triple-
check sources, And the people on
campus whose voices tend to be
heard and understood should be
aware of the fact that everyone
likes to repeat what they hear from
them. Therefore, what is heard
needs to be truth. So give us a

break, not just your version of the

facts.
