“Sieiiar tute

Still Whistlin' Dixie
8 seconds is too long

By Geoff Graham

Is Bigger than it Used to Be.” I’m

Afterthe enormous successof getting sick of artists writing pa-

the Pure Country soundtrack (due

not only to the exceptional music,
but also to George Strait’s phe-
nomenal performance), I expected
great things from the recently re-
leased original motion picture
soundtrack 8 Seconds. The album
touts such artists as Pam Tillis,
McBride & the Ride, Billy Dean,
and Mark Chesnutt, but despite the
heavyweight backing, stills fall far
short of my anticipations.

The best songs on the album
are admittedly, pretty good.
McBride & the Ride’s been on
CMT for quite a while with “No
More Cryin’” and hit the radio a
few weeks ago. An incredible base
line and catchy lyrics make this a

Pam Tillis hits the mark with
her rodeo/relationship analogy
“Pull- Your Hat Down Tight.” She
sings “Bound to be a hard. night
tonight /Baby pull your hat down
tight.” You can interpret that one
for yourself.

Surprisingly, Brooks & Dunn
produced the final good tune on
the album. “Ride ‘em High, Ride
‘em Low” is, yes, another rodeo
song (have you figured out what
the movie’s about, yet?) in the tra-
dition of “Boot Scootin’ Boogie.”
Think ofa gritty, upbeat “Amarillo
By Morning.”

As far as the rest of ‘em go,
Vince Gill sings a decent remake
of “When Will I Be Loved,” but
he’s got a long way to go to match
the original. Reba McEntire sings
just another Reba McEntirish song
in “If I Had Only Known.” Mark
Chesnutt let me down with “Texas

~~ Sxacily—pr

thetic songs about Texas. I’m sure
such songs do well in the Lone Star
State, but when they’re no good,
people just cringe and change the
station (that’s a message for all
those superstars out there who read
my article). Ican’t really condemn
Billy Dean’s “Once in a While.”
I’m sure the producers made a mis-
take. This song had to be written
for a Disney movie, and accidently
made it onto a country soundtrack.

I have to give John Anderson
an honorable mention. I really
don’t like most of his music, but if
Idid, I’d probably like “Burnin’ up
the Road.” It’s kind of like “Money
in the Bank,” but well written.

I know this review doesn’t

don’t let it turn you away. I’ve
seen the video for “No More
Cryin’” and I’ve seen the preview
on television. The movie will be
good. I really doubt it could be
anything as ground breaking as
Pure Country, but it will certainly
make headlines. Luke Perry stars
as rodeo legend Lane Frost with
Cynthia Geary (from “Northern
Exposure”) and Stephen Baldwin.
John Avildsen directs (Rocky, Ka-
rate Kid) and Michael Shamberg
(War of the Roses, A Fish Called
Wanda) and Tony Mark (The
Fisher King, Nowhere to Run) pro-
duce.
