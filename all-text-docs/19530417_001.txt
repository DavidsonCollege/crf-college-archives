JOHN MASON BROWN

World Telegram, Brown is at pre-
sent a contributing editor of the
Saturday Review, for which he
writes a weekly column of criti-
cism called “Seeing Things.” This
is also the title of his lecture.

To the chagrin of the lecture-
going public and of his booking
agent, Brown li:nits himself to
about seventy-five appearances an-
nually. “It would be no trouble at
all to line up John Mason Brown
for a talk every day in the year”,
said a spokesman for the agency
recently.

“We can’t begin to fill the re-
quests that pour in. Everyone
wants him back.”

A genius at establishing and
maintaining intimate communica-
tion with his audiences, Brown
pushes himself hard, emotionally

Voting Postponed
Until Next Week

Luke Scales, the chairman of the
Elections board, announced last
night that student body and other
elections would be resumed next
week.

Original plans had been for the
candidates for editor of the annual:
Bill Hood, Bill Moffett, and Win-
ston Wright, to speak in Chapel

plans already made for Thursday

Board of Directors. One senior anq! jageyminnions, and Anne Clark and

two Juniors will be elected to the

“D” FOOLIES OPEN BIG WEEKEND

D CLUB PRESENTS =|
VARIETY PROGRAM
TONIGHT AT 7:15

By TOM WARLICK

The big 1953 version of the “D
Club foolies” will be roaring down
the main line tonight at 7:15 in
Chambers Auditorium.

“This year's foolies will be the
biggest and best ever held. That's
all there is to it!!! * was the
only reply of the elusive producer-

Sunday at 4 o'clock in the
sanctuary of the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church with a recital

director, Dick Perkins, when he
was approached by reporters in his
apartment.

This is the same director who
brought the famous “big top” fool-
ies to this campus in 1952.

Setting the mood for this gala
performance will be Roy Palmer
and his Dixie-land combo, better
known locally as the “five cards
from hunger.”

Emphe-i.ng the theme of the
roaring twenties will be the fam-
ous song and dance routine of
Proctor and Mizelle, which is
slightly reminiscent of the flapper
girl era.

For only the fifty cent price of
admission, the entire audience will
serve as foils to the bum corp of
Ben Craig and Dan McCall.

Supporting this array of home-
grown talent will be professional
entertainment brought in from
New Orleans, La. Having just com-
pleted an engagement at the Roose-
velt Hotel, Peyton and Raye, long
a big-time vaudeville team, will
be the chief attraction for the
show.

This specialty number features
the voluptuous Miss Raye ably
assisted by her well trained cast
of canines. When asked about Miss
Raye by reporters, director Per-
kins immediately went off-the-rec-
ord with a curt “no comment.”

Also featured in the show along
with a great cast will be Bill Tay-
lor and Jim Bryan, who will per-
form great feats of musical ver-
satility, Al “Yogi” Ormond, who
will stun the audience during the

ist and head of the music depart-
ment at Lincoln Memorial Univer-
sity in Harrogate, Tennessee. The
recital will feature 16th century
compositions.

This year's Festival has for its
central theme “The Renaissance”,
with most of the programs being
devoted to that particular period
of endeavor in the various arts.
Continuing from April 19 through
May 12, the Festival will include a
variety of programs which should
appeal to all.

On April 22 John Mason Brown
will appear in Chambers Auditor-
ium in connection with the regular.
ly scheduled Artist Series. The
Davidson College Concert Band will
be heard on the 24th at 8:15 p. m.
in the David Ovens College Union.

A film entitled “ ‘The Eisen-
heim Altar Piece’ by Grunewald”,
accompanied by a recording of
“Matthias der Maler” by Hinde-
mith, a composition inspired by the
altar piece, along with a second
film, “Paintings by Rubens” will
be shown on April 27 in the Union
at 8:15 p.m. ~

PETE BROWN

Pete M. Brown, a graduate of
the 1950 class at Davidson was
killed in an accident which took
place at the United States Pre-

but also he was a track star. He
was a member of Phi Gamma Delta

Due to his prowess on the ath-
letic fields, he was a member of
the “D” Club. Phi Gamma Delta

several @f these years he was an
active participant on the Rifle

Team.

The Scabbard and Blade Spring
Tap Day took place at Regimental
Parade Tuesday afternoon at which
time two senior and sixteen juniors
were dubbed into the society.

The parade was in honor of Cor-
onel J. H. McGee, a member of
the G3 section of Third Army, who
was guest speaker for Scabbard
and Blade that evening. His very
informative address on guerrilla
warfare in Korea and the Philip-
pines was attended by seventy-five
students and members of Scabbard
and Blade.

ANTHONY T0 PLAY
CONCERT, DANCES

Perhaps the biggest dance
weekend in the history of
Davidson dances is on tap this
weekend, and the D Club
Foolies gets things started at
7:15 tonight.

Immediately afterward at 9:30
(which is a slight change from
earlier) the sweet strains from
“America’s Favorite Dance Band”
can be danced to in Johnston Gym-
nasium.

With his favorite “child”, the
Bunny Hop, as the theme, Ray An-
thony is expected to live up to
even the fondest dreams of anyone
in giving the campus the greatest
dance that he is capable of giving.

Mr. Anthony is not bringing
Marilyn Monroe, but he is bringing
two charming vocalists and the
best dance band in the world.

Ray has sent along his program
for the concert to be presented in
Chambers at 3:30 Saturday after-
noon and it contains the following
fine selections: Bugle Call Rag,
Harlem Nocturne, Idaho, Birth of
the Blues. Darktown Strutter’s
Ball, Perido, Blue Tango, Slaugh-
ter on Tenth Avenue, and When
the Saints Go Marching In (at
which time everyone turns it on).

About every third number Jo
Ann Greer; Tommy Mercer, ‘The
Skyliners, or The Anthony Choir
will sing a few selections thus
rounding out a program that will
be both popular and yet have some
of the old favorite boogie and jazz
pieces. It should be highly enter-
taining .and will last about two
hours.

The informal Saturday nite
dance will begin at eight o’clock
and will mark fhe close, officially,
of the dances. The weather is the
only question of the entire week-
end. The rest .is completely plan-
ned to be the best dance weekend
yet.
