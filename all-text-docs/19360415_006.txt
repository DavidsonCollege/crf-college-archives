ENATORS, representatives, states-
ae judges,doctors,lawyers,busi-
ness men and Jimmy the office boy...
they’re all out for the opening game.
Thrills never to be forgotten...

perhaps a home run... oran electri-
fying no-hit game.. . perhaps some
callow recruit, unheard of.in the big
time, smashing his way into the
hearts of the fans.

Basebal? brings pleasure to the
millions who watch it, and
rewards the stars who play it

At every game and wherever you go
you will find people enjoying Chesterfields.
Why... because Chesterfields are outstand-
ing for the pleasure they give... outstanding
for mildness ... outstanding for better taste.
More and more smokers, men and women
both, enjoy Chesterfield’s pleasing taste and
aroma...such popularity must be deserved.
