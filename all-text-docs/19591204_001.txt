Davidsonian Managing Editor
Thomas R. Waring, one of America’s most vocal
crusaders for segregation and states’ rights—“the Con-
servative southern viewpoint”—ended his Davidson Col-

Doug Clark's

floors, the varied program

p.m.

For the main feature of the
evening, George Kirkpatrick
has contracted Doug Clark's
combo, popularly known as the
“Hot Nuts”, which will make
its first formal appearance on
the campus. The popular com-
bo will entertain dancing in
the ballroom of the union un-
til 11:00 p.m.

In the cafeteria downstairs
checkered table cloths and can-
dies will set the scene for juke
box dancing in the area pro-
vided for those who favor mus-
ic of their own choosing.

Cave Counterpoint will pro-
vide a third dancing area
with Tom Colvin’s band fur-
nishing the beat and the bar
open for refreshments.

The first floor lobby will spe-

lege visit today.

Waring, after a full day's
round of debate and discussion
Thursday granted DAVIDSON-
IAN editors an interview con-
cerning his racial and political
views.

Explaining his mission as a
Southern editor, Waring said,
“What I try to do is this: ex-
press the conservative. South-
ern viewpoint, which I believe
is a majority viewpoint. I’ve
made an effort to present to
the best of my ability the ma-
jority opinion of the South. My
effort is to encourage tawful
and decent resistance to the
Supreme Court’s 1954 decision
in the hope that we can event-
ually get rid of this evil thing
(integration).”

Do you favor industrializa-
tion of the South, realizing
the possible social changes
which may come with it?

“I'm in favor of finding ad-

ditional ways to give employ-
ment to displaced farmers, to
replace some of the lost agricul-
tural income. I’m certainly in
favor of industrial develop-
ment. The South of course will
benefit from greater prosperity
of the Negro as a market for
its products. The more Negroes
who can be removed from re-
lief rolls, the less taxes the
white man will have to pay.”

What is your opinion on
the current dispute concern-
ing the required loyalty oath
for recipients of federal de-
fense scholarships?

“I'm not able to get excited
about it. I don’t see why any-
one would mind denying he was
a Communist. Most oaths anyway
are a sort of ritual thing like
taking off your hat in an ele-
vator or saluting the flag. Be-

sides, a banker asks you per-
sonal questions when you ap-
ply for a loan: you sacrifice)

money then. It’s the same thing

What is your opinion con-
cerning the integration of an

institution such as Davidson
College?

“T’d say this: you have a pret-
ty good college now, why
change it? You’d run the risk
of losing North and South Caro-
lina boys whose families op-
pose this thing, and contribu-
tors from Southern states would
surely fall away.”

In view of your support of
total school segregation, what
is your reaction to the failure
of “massive resistance” in
Virginia?

“I was disappointed to see
massive resistance fold up,
though I can’t say I was sur-
prised. Virginia got right up to
the sticking point there, then
backed down. Of course I feel
that any integration, token or
otherwise, is undesirable. Vir-
ginia was being watched by the
South for encouragement and
comfort, and she failed. Of
course we applauded the Prince
Edward County actior, where
they closed their schools, as a

On December 17, the Thursday before the holidays,

ning.

A free marshmallow roast
should attract couples to the
shuffleboard court on the south
side of the union adjacent to
the ballroom. In the private
dining room at the north side
of the ballroom, students are
invited to try their luck at
free bingo. Among the many
prizes offered at this attraction
will be a sport coat from Rush

As the ninth attraction,
Wyndell Merritt has contact-
ed over thirty girls from Wo-
man‘s College in Greensboro
and others from Queens as
hostesses for the night.
“These plans are not com-

ritt, “but if coordination is
made, we should have more

is toward bringing a date,

Woody Morcock, President of
the Union, commented, “We

CHAPEL ADDRESS

In his chapel address Mr.
Waring pointed out that science
has as yet failed to formulate
fully the differences among the
races.

Thus he contended that one
must look at the race question
without a sociological or politi-
cal slant, but must consider on-
ly the factors which are familiar
and which can be declared as
