Pat Carroll displays the human side of Gertrude Stein

Rain. A thunderclap. Rain.
Another thunderclap. Light.
Gertrude Stein.

‘Sometimes only in exile can
one truly represent one’s coun-
try.” A bold, confident chuckle.
“It was true of Dante and it is
true of me.”’

Without warning, almost
without mercy, Pat Carroll
unleashed upon her audience
the arrogant, indomitable and
aggressively self-glorifying per-
sonality of Gertrude Stein Ger-
trude Stein Gertrude Stem.

The play is set in Stein’s
Paris studio at 27 Rue de
Fleurus on the eve of Stein’s
eviction. Instead of packing
Stein spends the next two hours
rambling on about her life, with

fluent hands that dramatically .

mimed every memory, igniting
her small talk and personal
revelations into flaming pic-
tures. Her eyes gleamed, scorn-
ed, laughed, squinted, domin-
ated; her voice jumped octaves
with screeches of excitement,
anger, and fat, gaudy guffaws.
She spread before her the lives
of the legendary people who
frequented her Paris salon—
Matisse, Picasso, brother Leo,
Hemingway, Fitzgerald—and
let the praise and the criticism
fall where it would, always in
complete control. She talked a
lot about herself, too. A puff on
her cigar, a sip of iced tea and
another excited anecdote. And
another, and another, and an-
other...

Despite its one-and-a-half
year stint on the New York City
stage, Gertrude Stein Gertrude
Stein Gertrude Stein was orig-
inally intended for college cam-
puses and concert halls. ‘‘I felt

that this kind of arrogant
personality—this woman who
had a dominant personality —
would appeal to young people,
explained Pat_Carroll after her
performancesat Love: Auditor-
ium Monday'night. ”
Personality is the main ac-

‘cent of Carroll’s portrayal. of

Stein. Carroll recalled that in
1934, Gertrude Stein toured
American college campuses to
talk about her exploratory writ-
ing, in which she tried to adapt
the cubism of Picasso to literary
form. Although response to
Stein’s bizarre grammatical in-
novations was unethusiastic,
Carroll said that ‘‘somebody did
something right, because these
kids really learned...Maybe it
wasn’t the subject matter, but
her personality; but at least she
made them think!”’

The play explores relatively
little of Stein’s literary cubism.
Instead, it leaves no nook or
cranny of her personality un-
touched. In fact, Gertrude Stein
the person dominates every
aspect of her life. Consequently,
a thorough knowledge of her life
and times is not necessary to
grasp the message of the piece.

Even then, it deals not as
much with biographical por-
traiture as with the questions
that arose in Stein’s life, par-
ticularly questions having to do
with her own identity. Twice
she asks, ‘‘What happens to
identity and memory when they
are confronted with eternity?”
Throughout the play she strug-
gles with the question. After
accumulating a wall-full of mod-
ern (the latest by Matisse,
Picasso, Gaugin, and others)
she decides that she must
become a writer, to ‘‘do with
words what they did with
paint.’’ She considers why she

left America for Paris, and why
it was necessary to break her
close relations with her brother
Leo over intellectual disagree-
ments about art. At one point
she shakes an invisible Pablo
Picasso ‘‘by the lapels,” like a
stern mother, forcing him to
accept his identity as a painter
aand to give up attempts to
write poetry. ‘‘Words are not
his maticre,”’ she insists calmly.

Carroll stressed Stein's strug-
gle with identity in its relation
to the student audience: ‘‘Stud-
ents in this college are here
because of identity. They want

to find out who they are. And I
think, at least in this play, thut
is the most important thing...”
She further emphasized leaving
her audiences with the ques-
tions raised. ‘‘The most import-
ant thing,’’ says Stein, ‘‘is
coming up with the questions.
There are no answers—no an-
swers! —only questions.”’

And when Stein asks them,
the questions become chal-
lenges. Explained Carroll,
‘‘She’s a big picture. She allow-
ed herself to be human. She
allowed herself to be arrogant.
She allowed herself to be petty.

The Chortling Matriarch of 27 Rue de Fleurus.

She allowed herself to use her
brain and wasn’t ashamed to
say, ‘I want to be a genius!’
We're all afraid to do those
things today.”

English Professor Cynthia
Lewis commented, “The readi-
ness with which she accepted
new artistic movements..speaks
to us as members of a small
town in a traditional place and
urges us to look at our own lives
from a new perspective, in a
new light.”’

Added Carroll, ‘‘This allows
me...to say some things I think
are important about living — not
about art or about writing — but
about living.”

Student response to Stein
seemed enthusiastic if not uni-
form. Sophomore Elizabeth
Kiss, for example, emphasized
Stein’s ability to recognize her
limitations, overcome them and
affirm herself: ‘‘She just decid-
ed to say, ‘Well, I’m going to be
a genius.’ She decided that she
would be one!”’

In contrast, junior John
Hartman admitted, ‘‘I still feel
like the only reason Gertrude
Stein is famous is because she
knew a lot of famous people.” —

In any event, Carroll’s hope
‘that somebody gets hold of a
word or a thought’’ seemed
fulfilled when, after the perfor-
mance, a freshman girl mounted
the stage and approached Car-
roll for an autograph.

Carroll took the program
from her, and, writing, said,
“You'll notice how I sign all
these things now: Identity al-
ways! I started doing that
because of this play...it seemed
to me that’s what it’s all
asout.’’ She handed back the
program.

“Thank you, it’s really been
great,’’ said the girl, beaming
with admiration. Before turning
to leave, she said, ‘‘I know I'll
be reading about Gertrude
Stein.”

Carroll looked up at her and
answered, smiling, ‘‘Well good,
it won’t hurt ya!”
