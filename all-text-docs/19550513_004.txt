a conference, while 51.6% opposed

rit.

Ill. If you favor one of the
above programs, what policy
should Davidson follow in the in-
terim? (A) increased subsidization,
(B) present subsidization, (C) de-
creased subsidization? Of the stu-
dents fe oring a non-subsidized
conferem 1, 26% favored increased
subsidization in the interim, 57.67
‘favored the present amount, and
16.3% favored decreased subsidiza-
tion.

IV. If you do not favor a non-
subsidized conference, what level
of subsidization do you favor? (A)
Increase to $50,000, (B) present
$30,000, (C) Decreased subsidiza-
tion? 84.8% of the students favor-
ing subsidized athletics wanted in-
creased subsidization, 13.4% fa-
vored the present amount, and
21% desired decreased subsidiza-
tion.

V. Do you favor basketball and
other sports getting a larger share
of this money? 86.7% of. the stu-
dents polled answered this ques-
tion in the affirmative, while only
13.3% dissented.

VI. Have you read editorials,
statements of policy, and have you
attended the forums on athletic
subsidization? 81.2% of the stu-
dents polled had either read edi-
torials or attended forum(s) or
both.

VIII. Have these influenced
your opinion? Of the 81.2%
answering Yes to question 6, 42.6%
indicated that their opinion had
been influenced somewhat by the
discussion, while 57.4% were not
influenced at ail.

Perhaps the most significant
fact indicated by this poll is the
percentage of students who favor
larger subsidization to basketball
and to the “minor sports.” Real-
izing the greater expense involved
in producing a top-flight football
team, undoubtedly, they feel that
Davidson would be more success-
ful in building far-famed basket-
ball or tennis teams.

Taking part in the administra-
tion of this poll were: B. Sharp,
B. Fraley, C. Staton, C. Helms, C.
McGowan, J. Ballenger, N. Payne,
H. Wells, C. Patterson, B. Beall,
P. Woodward, B. Turner, S. Fer-
guson, R. Bates, L. Carter, J.
Trawick, and S. Wallece.
