RINGING IN THE NEW YEAR
Store Manager Peter Nicholls rings up another refund.

Governance Plan Creates
Residence Hall Manager

As a part of the new gover-
nance procedures, a new posi-
tion known as Residence Hall
Manager has been created for
the purpose of dormitory main-
tenance, security, and counsel-
ing.

According to Dean of Students
Will H. Terry, the residence
hall managership, which was
instituted this summer by the
Board of Trustees, will serve
the students in a number of
ways.

First and foremost, Terry
said, the residence hall .man-
agers will inform the Dean of
Students and housing author-
ities of physical problems in

the dorm buildings. Also, these ,

managers will have pass keys
to every room to let in students
who might get locked out.
Furthermore, the managers
will keep up with unauthorized
persons in the dorm whom they
suspect as security problems.
“The residence hall managers

will be resource people to
whom a student may go for
assistance in any problem,”
Terry said. ‘‘We feel that this
program speaks of a presence
and of our concern for the stu-
dents.”

Terry emphasized that the
managers will be “remifders,
not tattletales or snoopers —
that is, unless some stident is
totally obnoxious and deserves
to be reported, for the good of
all others.”

According to ithe letter sent
out by Terry to the new man-
agers, the students selected
have ‘‘tact, patience, and a
responsible style of life.””. Each
of the five managers will be
paid one hundred dollars a
term.

Each of the dorms housing
upperclassmen will have a resi-
dence hall manager, except for
Belk, which will have two.

The residence hall managers,
according to Terry, are Lee

Student Store Reduces
Prices On Textbooks

By DAVID FOERSTER
Staff Writer

Due to President Nixon's
wage and price freeze, the Dav-
idson Student Store closed on
Wednesday, October 8, to read-
just prices adding to the confu
sion that was created by the

opening day of classes.

The items effected in the
price reductions were only text
books used in academic
courses. According to Peter
Nicholls, manager of the store,
the confusion was principally
due to the fact that the books
had been ordered prior to the
President's August 15 procla.
mation and that the respective
printing houses had raised their

* prices.

The book store, following suit,
raised their prices correspond-

Farnell! (Richardson), Bill
Spencer (Little), Tom Ioanes
(Belk third and fourth), Tad
Porter (Belk first and second),
and Tom Sinks (Duke).

ing to the guide lines set
the publishers.

Nicholls, receiving word of
the ruling only Tuesday, Sept.
7 from the National Association
of College Stores, talked to rep-
resentatives of the Cost of Liv-
ing Council to verify the rul
ing. It was therefore necessary
to sell all text books for the
identical prices charged dur-
ing the 1970-1971 academic year
or the prices charged prior to
August 14 if the books were
used during the summer ses-
sion.

The store is making refunds
for all academic items pur
chased prior to the Sept. 8 price
reduction, Nicholls said.

If a student, professor, or
member of the community has
reason to question the price
charged for a text book, he may
check the list of affected items
which is posted in the book
store.

Another change in the David
son Student Store policy was
the addition of state sales tax
on all items, including all aca
demic materials. According to
Nicholls this was done by a
recent directive from the comp
troller’s office. The order was
issued, according to Robert A.

Curric, business manager, be-
cause of the increase in oper-
aling expenses.

The store is an auxiliary en-
terprise of the College which
is chartered as a non-profit or-
ganization. Therefore the store
is considered gs such.

The store is organized to
make a profit, the surplus go-
ing into the general fund of the
college. However, there has noi
been any appreciable profit dur
ing the past two fiscal years.
The store does its own account
ing, but expenses such as sal
aries and general operating ex-
penses including books, supplies,
heat, air conditioning, electric-
ity. and janitorial services, are
paid directly by the Comptrol
ler’s Office, according to Currie.

The store states in its basic
policy concerning profits ‘‘sup-
plies and books are marked as
low as feasible: gifts and other
items carry a normal retail
profit. The store is college own-
ed. the staff and management
are salaried and no commis-
sions are. paid. Any excess of
income over expenses is used
by the college for general op
crating expenses.”

The store grosses a little over
$150,000 a year.

Senate Begins Academic Year

By Creating Chancellor Post

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

The student Senate cranked
up its business this year by
creating a chancellorship posi-
tion to help handle the paper
work and other functions of the
student government.

Sophomore Rob Strand has
been offered the position for
the year, and his job will take
approximately two hours per
day for a five day week at
minimum wage.

As an SGA employee, the
chancellor will be in charge of
the minutes, functions, and
physical details of the senate
meetings. The  chancellorship
will also include all typing,
mimeographing, and secretarial
work of the senate.

In addition he will be in
charge of sifting solicitations
that come to the SGA and pub-
lishing ‘them for the student
body. Invitations to conferences
must also be culled.

Finally, the chancellor will
serve as coordinator for the
National Student Association, of
which Davidson is a member.
He will keep in touch with na-
tional headquarters for possible
speakers and other nationwide
campus information.

SGA President Danny Clod-
felter stated that ‘‘a chancel-
lor will be especially helpful
in keeping the SGA running
while newly-elected officers be-
come familiar with their du-

ties.”

The senate voted to give and
a $25 bonus at the end of the
year if his work proved satis-
factory. His yearly salary, tak-
en from SGA funds, will run

around $500.

In other business, the senate
discussed possible responses to
the college if the faculty re-
jected SGA _ proposals” which
will come before them in the
next month.

In former faculty voting, a
three-fourths majority has yet
to be obtained on proposals to
put students on the Admissions
and Budget, Building, and
Ground Committees.

The proposal for open faculty
meetings and the proposal to
combine social and cultural ac-
tivities on campus under one
umbrella committee will be
voted on in October.

A shortage of parking space
on campus this year also dis-

semqereee rowan etamanen

cussed. There have been more
permits issued than there are
available spaces.

Senior senato. Phil Dotts was
appointed to investigate legal
questions and to draft a traffic
proposal.

Fund-raising ideas were con-
sidered, including such _ pro-
grams as student cooperatives
on books and records.

Sophomore Doug Brown and
junior Reggie Kennedy were
appointed to the Senate Execu-
tive Committee and the vacan-
cy left by senator Doug Sittler,
now in France, will be filled in
the near future, pending con-
Stitutional details.
