Display Offers Optical

By Frank Soos

A veritable retinal riot! Yes,
that’s the current art work on
display in Stowe Galleries.
Stowe Galleries are located in
the Cunningham Fine Arts
Building, for the benefit of
those 85 per cent or so of you
who have never found your way
before.

The artist responsible for the
dazzling colors you'll see in
Stowe is Anne Kesler Shields
of WinstonSalem. She is a
graduate of Hollins College and
The Unijversity of North Caro-
lina at Greensboro.

Her work has been shown
nation-wide in such shows as
New Directions in Color Print-
Making, presented by Associ-
ated American Artists in New
York City. Internationally, she
has been represented in the
Musee d’ Art et d’ Historie in
Geneva, Switzerland as well as
in the U. S. Pavillion at Expo
20, Tokyo.

Mrs. Shields’ medium is silk
screen and her technique is
dots, nothing but dots. But those
dots can drive you wild. A
black and white print will ex-
pand and contract before your
eyes — dots grow larger and
smaller. Sometimes, the colors
change before your eyes.

Don't rush through the show;

TODD HOBBIE

Stare at each print from across
the room, watch it move. Don't
look too long, it’s like looking
into the sun, — turn away and
you'll find the print’s image is
etched on your retina.

After you've driven yourself
dizzy from afar, take a closer
look at each print. You'll see
that the two colors represented
interact with each other, fight
each other. Paintings throb be-
cause your eye cannot chose
between the two colors.

At other times. two colors
can interact to produce the ap-
pearance of a completely new
and different hue. Yet most of
those dots are white in prints
that your eye will be reading
as pale blue or grey.

For the scientific - minded,
this aspect of color theory,
quite a far cry from the good
ol’ jr. high science color wheel,
has been investigated mainly
by an artist named Josef Al-
bers. His work chiefly shows
that a color on a white back-
ground just isn't the same when
it’s thrown in with different
hues. Throw in some dots and
you've got instant confusion.

There's a print in the lobby
ofthe union for those of you
ivho may feel that a trip to
Cunningham is too risky right
off. There’s also an Anne Kes-
Jer Shiclds print available for

rental through the college art
rental program.

If you feel like you must
have one for your very own,
the prices are very reasonable
for an artist of Mrs. Shields’
Standing, ($15 tto $65). Check

HOWARD RAMAGLI

with Herb Jackson for prices
on any specific painting.
Drop by and see the show;
it'll be up until September 30.
Give your optic nerves a work-
out. When you leave, you'll
have a hard time remember-

ing which dots were yellow and
which were orange when you
came in the door.

Or maybe you can step into
a closet and take another look
at that image that keeps stick-
ing in your eye.

Blue Sky Report Brings

High Flying For Faculty

Recently in Raleigh I attend-
ed a meeting at which a mem-
ber of the Board of Higher Ed-
ucation made this observation.

“Two schools have just re-
cently revised their curricu-
lums. One was a private insti-
tution, the other public.

“The educational revisions of
both institutions consisted of
going from a semester system
to a quarter or trimester sys-
tem and instead of requiring
specific courses, requiring
courses in a particular disci-
pline, allowing the student to
elect the courses from that dis-
cipline.”

After a brief pause he con-

Academic Involvement:

No Excuse For Apathy

After two weeks back at
school the newness has worn
off even for freshmen, summer
has departed from most stu-
dents’ minds. Emphasis is now
placed upon either studying for
reviews, writing papers or up-
on plans for weekends to come.
In other words Davidson’s rou-
tine has begun and Davidson
mind patterns are set.

The first two sentences of
this column could begin a ser-
mon on any of a thousand dif-
ferent subjects. This column,
of course, will deal with the
most important one, that is the
unfair position that a. student
can take within his society.

Having spent last year in
France under Davidson’s JYA
program I can from experience
say that the students who can
most easily slip into this unfair
position are the Junior Year
Abroad students. They live in

a world unlike’ that of anyone
else.

They are Americans who can
pretend that they are not
Americans, They can sit in
their rooms in France, Ger-
many or Spain reading “Time”
or ‘‘Newsweek” and pass judg-
ment on the world, and in
particular their country, with-
out keeping in mind the fact
that they are a part of that
which they are judging. They
can even come home and con-
tinue exempting themselves
from their society’s problems.

However, although JYA stu-
dents may be more susceptible
to this trap of self-deception,
the students on the Davidson
campus are by no means im-
mune.

It is all too simple after re-
turning to campus to exempt
oneself from the world outside
the Davidson city limits and
sit in the judgement seat over-

Vulgarity In Allen Column
Offensive To. Workman

To The Editor:

I cannot help wondering why
the vulgarity was included in
the otherwise excellent, percep-
lve, instructive, and valuable
column by Bobby Allen in THE
WAVIDSONIAN of September

_E believe that the vulgarity
“as not only offensive to many
readers (as iit was to me) but
that it also detracted from the
bersuasiveness of the message.

I am not requesting that you
publish this letter, although you
certainly have my permission
to do so (or to publish only the
first paragraph, if you prefer).

I am writing because I wish
to urge you to consider includ-
ing in your editorial policy the
avoidance of unnecessary of-
fensiveness.

looking the world without real-
izing oneself to be a part of
all the mess that one reads
about in the paper or sees on
the evening news.

The fact is that being a stu-
dent on a campus in any nation
puts a person in a very de-
manding position. Rather than
only giving the right to stand
in judgment, the position of
student also demands that a
person strive to understand
what is going on around him,
associate himself with the prob-
lems as a member of a society
that produces such problems
and act in response to this
association.

The privilege of being a stu-
dent rather. than working for
$1.60 an hour in some ditch
demands a responsibility.

It is, of course, a fact that
while on the Davidson campus
there is relatively little oppor-
tunity for active involvement
to any great degree except in
infrequent circumstances. Aca-
demic involvement alone inhi-
bits activism to a degree.

But academic involvement
cannot be an acceptable ex-
cuse for stepping into the trap
of seeing onself as a_ being
aloof from his fellow humans
who with him make up a so-
ciety im which problems a-
bound.

Whether or not we are stu-
dents at Davidson, each one of
us is a member of a racist so-

‘ciety, a polluter in a polluted

environment and at least a sup-
porter of a warring nation. To
exempt oneself from it all is
a dream.

tinued with a chuckle and sar-
castically added, ‘‘And they
have called these changes ed-
ucational innovation.”

When questioning him after-
ward, I tried to draw out of
him the names of the schools he
had mentioned. I even went so
far as to suggest that Davidson
might be the guilty one. He
refused to confirm or deny my
charge, but I was left with sus-
picion that his chuckle may
have been directed at David-
son.

The Blue Sky Report was the
hopeful panacea for the ‘‘dull
and unimaginative’ education-
al program that the Visiting
Committee of the Southern As-
sociation of Colleges and
Schools found at Davidson.

Many felt that the Blue Sky
would give new direction to the
college’s educational system
and provide new and exciting
opportunities for students.

The major thrust of the Blue
Sky Report was to provide flex-

ibility in the student’s educa- -

tional program. The flexibility
was achieved through ‘‘a new
calendar, a provision for. area
requirements . . . a three-track
plan ...., and by the proposal
of an Honors College.”

Along with these devices were
proposals for a multi-media
learning center, an Asian study
program, and a career/service
program.

All of these pieces were to
mesh into a_ structure that
would give education at David-
son a new look, a look of in-
novation.

For the most part, the new
look is the old system with a
new name. Independent study
courses are nothing more than
a course with a free cut policy
and no lectures. Any course
with a free cut policy would
be an independent study course
for the student is still respon-
sible for the material covered
in the course.

The new 3-3-2 system means
that instead of covering the
material in a course, Say or-
ganic chemistry, in two semes-
ters or thirty-two weeks, the
student must master the same
amount of material in two quar-
ters or twenty weeks.

Fallen by the wayside are
the area examinations, which
were supposedly to provide the
student with incentive to do
outside reading in each of the
four areas. (More examinations
for the student, a truly “‘jn-
novative” idea.)

In the place of area examin-
ations, we now have Extended

Studies. This program has per-
haps the most potential for be-
ing an alternative to classroom
learning.

Extended studies gives the
Student an opportunity to de-
sign an educational experience
which is valid for him. Extend-
ed studies may be the closest
idea to educational innovation.
now in operation at Davidson.

Of the other programs men-
tioned above, we now have an
good Asian study program, an
operating Honors College, a ca-
reer/service program that is
just getting underway this year,
and a learning center which
probably has not even reached
the drawing board stage. So
what has Davidson really ac-.
complished with its ‘‘new’ Blue
Sky curriculum?

An indicator of the answer
to that question is found by
the length of discussion of ad-
vantages found in the Blue Sky
report.

The advantages to the stu-
dents needed only one-half a
page, but the advantages for
the faculty needed three pages.
The students received a_philo-
sophical brush-off on how the
new curriculum would make
“education more relevant to his
times.” The faculty received a
discussion on how this new pro-
gram would not add to their
work load.

The Blue Sky was nothing
more than an attempt to
smooth over the rough spots of
those whose pride had been
hurt by being called ‘“‘dull and
unimaginative.” The Blue Sky
provided very little innovation
and very little change in the
educational process at David-
son.

The student has not received
anything new and exciting in
education at Davidson. The stu-
dent may have flexibility, but
the flexibility lies in manipulat-
ing an old system with the new
name.

Perhaps the only comment
that can be made about educa-
tional innovation at Davidson
is a sacastic chuckle.
