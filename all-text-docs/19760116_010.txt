“WHAT NOW, COACH?”: girls’ cave aopaman
IMAC basketball, a rare treat,
indeed!

By KIRK COMBE and
THOM BLACKWOOD

Do you ever pause to won-

~ Davidson is on earth, or why

we write a report of meaning-

> less IMAC competition. If

you do, you’re a fool.

The board is up, the divi-
sions are set, and IMAC
basketball is underway. Bask-
etball, besides academics of

course, is the axle around
which the wheels, and spokes,

and rims of life here at Davi-
dson revolve. For this reason,
IMAC basketball has become
increasingly important these
last two years.

Not only is it important to
participate in IMAC basket-
ball, but winning is every-

thing. This season the IMAC

champion earns a berth in the
Southeastern Regionals of the
National IMAC tournament
(speaking of which, the young
looking Corey Mean will be
unable to aid his IFT team

College experience made real

by intramural basket ball

must miss the game for baby-
sitting duties; a twenty-five
dollar fine seems reasonable).

And speaking of fines, an
even stiffer fine awaits the
IMAC team that subs its first
string with two minutes left
while up by twenty points and
presses (right, High Point?).
Like three consecutive nights
with a rabid library rat.

And speaking of substi-
tuting, what is to be done with
a certain white-haired ego-
maniac (no, not Ed Farrell)
who is playing his subs while
sitting his players? (Right,
Bo?)

In regular game action not
much of anything has been
going on. All of the top ranked
teams have been mediocre,
while the lesser teams have
definitely been lesser teams.

Speaking of lesser teams,
the freshman-burdened Dav-
idson Mildcats are providing
an excellent example for all
B-league teams this season.
But, with no upperclassmen
players available to him, Mild
D. Catte has been forced to
use almost exclusively the
newcomers, thus providing an
excellent excuse and an addi-
tional year on his contract to
“work with my recruits.”

Nostalgia demands intelli- \
gent sports fans to recall when
a bad year for the Mildcats
was 18-9. But intelligence is at
ebb tide this year in old
Johnston Gym. The fans are
there. Enough players are
there. Where are the coaches?

Speaking of coaches, these
reporters have repeatedly seen
too many useless males
coaching at the girls’ games.
Beware of ulterior motives,
unless you are into that sort of
thing.

But now to the scores:
57-43, 49-40, 38-37 on a close
one and a partial score at the
half, 12. But that’s neither
here nor there, c’est la guerre.

And speaking of Harry
Krohn’s coaching credentials,
who cares if you were a two
handed, second string, set
shooting artist on Mr. Bric-
kles’ high school team in
Goof-Ball, Ohio? He does,
however, have an excellent
conception of navels which
qualifies him as the perfect
Mildcat “‘big man” coach.

Now that nothing is sacred,
we only want to say ‘Pick up
on this.”” James, it’s all up to
you.
