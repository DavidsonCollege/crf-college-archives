Redmen Next Opponent
For ’Cats In Regionals

Tomorrow afternoon the
Davidson Wildcats tackle the
St. John’s Redmen in Col
lege Park, Md., in the first
round of the NCAA cham
pionship basketball tourney.

The ‘Cats, newly crowned
Southern Conference Cham
pions and currently riding a
12-game winning streak, beat
St. John’s earlier this year
70-54 on the Redmen’s home
court.

The victor of this game
will advance to the East-
ern Regionals in Raleigh
March 15-16. The winner
there advances to the NC-
AA finals in Los Angetes
the next weekend.

In a game before the Da-
vidson-St. John’s game to-
morrow LaSalle faces Colum-
bia. It is the winner of that
game which will face the
winner of the Davidson game
in the first game of the East-
ern Regionals next week in
Raleigh.

Also playing at Raleigh
will be the winner of this

weekend's ACC tournament.
That team will play the win-
ner of the St. Bonaventure-
Boston College game.

Then the winner of that
game will face the other win-
ner for a trip to Los Angeles

for the national semi-finals.
For the Wildcats, the
Southern Conference Tourna-
ment was a time of triumph
in several ways. First, the
Cats were able to shatter an
alleged tournament jinx by
waltzing through all three
games without difficultv.

The victory also completed
revenge on West Virginia,
who had beaten the ‘Cats
earlier in the year and last
year in the tournament fi-
nals.

Also the ‘Cats were able
fo place all five starters on
either the first or second
All-Tournament teams. Al-
though sophomore Mike
Maloy was the only player
to make first team, Doug
Cook, Dave Moser, Jerry
Kroll and Wayne Heckel
were all named to the sec-
ond team, and Rod Knowles
was given honorable men-
lion.

Going into tomorrow's
game, the ‘Cats have five
men averaging in double fig
ures, four starters and sixth.

playmaker Dave Moser

West Virginia, Huckel, and Skins

West Virginia did win two contests Saturday night.
They had better looking cheerleaders than we did, and
their fans also put on a superior show, but I guess you
can’t blame Johnny Durham, head Davidson cheer-
leader. He doesn’t have too much to work with. Too
bad their basketball team didn’t follow their cheer.
leaders’ example. It might have been a better game.

West Virginia lost in rebounds, foul shots, shoot-
ing percentage, total points, sportsmanship. and just
about everything else. Oh, I forgot. They also won
“the team with the most obnoxious fans” award. When
we were warming up before the game on Saturday
night at the Mountaineer end of the court, the fans
were jeering us about everything from our basketball
ability to our haircuts. They even had some choice
words for those of us who are substitutes. It get's
pretty low when you have to jeer the skin team. Un-
believably, West Virginia put two players on the All
Tournament team, which is more than Davidson did.

The men who choose the All-Tournament team
must have been looking at the WVU cheerleaders or
something else during the game on Saturday because
Maloy was the only Davidson player to make the first
team. He was joined by WVU’s Ron Williams and
Carey Bailey, Richmond’s Kenny Foster. and Furman’s
Dick Esleeck. Of course, the. remaining four Davidson
starters were placed on the second tournament team,
but 1 think the Davidson five could have beaten any
all-star team assembled in the Southern Conference.

Individually, Wayne Huckel deserves the ‘hard
nose player” award for the tournament. Wayne was
on the floor most of the three games and after WVU’s
Wayne Porter pushed Huckel into the basket support,
he came out with only a sore cheek bone and a rope
burn. Porter would have won no popularity contests
that night. Even on the television in West Virginia, he
was denounced. Charlotte’s Bill Currie did his utmost
to please the Mountaineer fans during the game but
this incident was too much. After Huckel was pushed,
the West Virginia color man said, “I don’t think Porter
was really trying to hurt Huckel.” Currie immediately
replied, “No, I don't think he was trying to hurt Wayne,
I think he was trying to kill him.” Well anyway, dur-
ing the awards ceremony, Wayne went over and shook
Porter’s hand, which is more than I would have done.

Getting back to politics, I decided to get in the
tradition of choosing post season all-star teams by
putting out my all-conference skin team. I only chose
five players because to choose a second team would
have seemed ironic to those receiving the places. At the
guard positions, I put Ed “Possum” Harvard of WVU
and our own Tony “Big-O” Orsbon. The Possum played
in few games this year but was the spark plug on the
WVU's skin team. At times he would get confused as
to which basket to shoot at, but since he was a poor
shooter (a 19.2 field goal percentage last year) it didn’t
make much difference. Tony is probably the best
player on the all-conference skin team if there is such
a thing. He hasn’t shot 100% this season like he did
last year because he didn’t shoot as often. Tony said
he got rusty between shots this year.

As the forwards I picked Garland Pinkston of
George Washington and Kent Greenway of Richmond.
Pinkston was a starter for GW this year but he played
like a skin as did the rest of the GW starters. Pinkston
was chosen over his companions because he sported a
mustache for the entire season. Greenway earned his
position on the All-Skin team by being one of the few
players who fakes after he passes the ball. Also ] knew
he was a great skin when in our game he recovered a
ball going out of bounds and threw it back hitting a
Davidson player. The ball bounced out of bounds again
but typically Kent caught it as he stood outside the
Sideline.

Rounding out the team is Carl Erkenbrecker of
Furman. Carl averaged‘0.8 points last season ahd at
times this year it seems as though he catches better
with his feet than his hands. I know I have passed up
some real good skins.in my selections but a s

in player
isn’t made, he’s born that way. As acting skin coach,
(something skins don’t really need) I will accept any
challenges from any “B” league high school team in
the nation.

Improved Batcats To Begin
Schedule Against Pfeiffer

By BILL TRAXLER
Sports Writer

Wildcat baseball gets un-
derway next Friday when
Davidson hosts Pfeiffer Col-
lege at 2 p.m. Head Coach
Tom Stevens is hopeful that
this season's team will be
much stronger than last
year's,

Last season the ‘Cats were
able to muster only three
wins over a 23 game sched.
ule. That team was weak in
nearly all departments. The
‘Cats had only three pitch.
ers, inconsistent hitting and
poor field support.

This year the hitting is
greatly improved. Freshmen
will be permitted to play var
sity baseball for the first
time thi. year.

Coach Bob Brown has tak-
en over the coaching duties
during the spring workouts.
and he is shaping the team
into a solid one. The players
are conditioning more than
they have for past seasons.

The Wildcats will. be two
men deep at nearly every
position this year. Both Hank
Strickland and Mike Kelly
are talented catchers and
strong hitters. They are also
valuable to the team for their
ability to play several posi-

|

{

tions.

Strickland plays a good
first base position and it will
be easy for him to alternate
with Kelly behind the plate
in doubleheaders.

Freshmen Mark Baker and
Cliff Patterson are both quick
second basemen. Stu Brown
returns to shortstop. Gordon

Slade brings experience to
the third base slot.

Frank Murphy,
Smith, Cooper Brantley, Jack
Caldwell and Bob Niebauer
will compete for the outfield
positions. Ed Terry, Bob
Pickens and Mackey Reavis
will carry the pitching chores
this season.

If you don’t agree that
business destroys individuality,
maybe it's because you're an
individual.

There’s certain campus talk that claims
individuality is dead in the business world.
That big business is a big brother destroy-

ing initiative.

But freedom of thought and action. when
backed with reason and conviction’s cour-
age, will keep and nurture individuality
whatever the scene: in the arts, the sciences,

and in business.

Scoffers to the contrary, the red corpus-
cles of individuality pay off. No mistake.

Encouraging individuality rather than
suppressing it is policy in a business like
Western Electric—where we make and pro-

vide things Bell telephone companies need.
Because communications are changing fast,
these needs are great and diverse.

Being involved with a system that helps
keep people in touch, lets doctors send car-
diograms across country for quick analysis,
helps transmit news instantly, is demand-
ing. Demanding of individuals.

If your ambition is strong and your abili-

Cy

ties commensurate, you'll never be truly
happy with the status quo. You'll seek
ways to change it and—wonderful feeling!—
some of them will work.

Could be at Western Electric.
