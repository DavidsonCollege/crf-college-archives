THE DAVIDSONIAN

The “performance” on Thursday afternoon by Presby-
terian’s third base coach was one of the most flagrant
examples of bad sportsmanship that your scribe has ever
seen on any baseball diamond. Even the old “outlaw”
Carolina League and the rowdiest service team loops
were mild in comparison. Of course it’s easy for an athelet
to “lose his head” at times and to say and do things which
he later regrets but when one of those ‘‘spur of the mo-
ment” acts actually endangers the life and limb of his
opponent (as was the case last week when the P. C. base-
baller jumped into the group gathered at the plate with
the obvious intention of spiking: someone) it’s time for
the coach to send him to the showers for good. Tactics
like that just don’t go.

Bad feeling between the two strongholds of
Presbyteriansm is not something new. Back in
1926 when the two schools met on the gridiron
five fights broke out during the course of the
game, making it necessary for the officials to
forceably eject a number of both elevens’ starters.
The Wildcats finally came out on the top, 3-0
and then went on to roll over Duke 20-0, Caro-
lina 10-0, and State 3-0, (the Wake Forest game
ended in a 3-3 tie) winning the Big Five Crown for
the last time. However, after this struggle the
two colleges severd relations (as far as that parti-
cular sport was concerned) and since that: day
Davidson and Presbyterian have not faced each
other in football

Getting back to baseball, it seems that it’s about time
to doff our caps to Coach Charlie Jamerson and his rapid-
ly improving squad. After a very inauspicious beginning
the Cats have begun,to hit their stride and will without a
doubt collect some scalps on their current Northern road
trip which is carrying them into Virginia, Maryland, and
the District of Columbia. The locals, with a revamped
lineup, crashed into the winner's circle first on April: 16th
by blasting an erratic Uni. of Cincinnati nine, 9 to 7.
This was followed by a 5-2 loss to the powerful Tar Heels
of North Carolina. Dickie B¥anks drew his first starting
assignment in this tilt and went the route, allowing only
7 blows, but he was bested by the visitors ace, Vin Dilo-
renzo. Jamerson’s charges, behind some neat twirling by
Torrence and Earp, then unleased their heavy artillery
and swept to a pair. of victories at the expense of Presby-
terian and Wofford, Unless some rained out- games are
rescheduled the last chance to see the “47 squad in actjon
will be on May 10th when the Clemson Tigers invade the
local ballyard. This should be a scorcher because the Ben-
gals shaded the ’Cats 2 to 1 in an earlier meeting in South
Carolina.

e

The Class “D” North State League gets underway this
week, affording local fans ample opportunity to see good
baseball. without having to wander too far afield. Both
the preseason favorites, the Mooresville Moors’, and the
Concord Weavers’ parks are within range of the campus.
As an added attraction two gals pro teams will play a
pair of exhibition games in Charlotte’s Griffith Park on
May 15th and 16th.

The red hot race for the interfraternity cup is now
in the home stretch. If the Kappa Sigs finish ahead of
their closest rivals, the Phi Gams and the Phi Delts,
in the softball round robin the trophy should be theirs.
Judging from the games played to date that’s what'll hap-
pen in all probability.

The Clemson Tigers are still on top of the
heap in the mad scramble for the Southern Con-
ference baseball crown. Carolina and the upsurg-
ing Duke Blue Devils will battle for Big Five
honors. The third contender, Wake Forest, was
rudly dumped out of the pace setting group by
three resounding defeats — Altho the Tar Heels
copped first place in the annual Carolina OAU
track meet last Saturday Davidson’s “Torch”
Turnbull and “Gunder” Gray turned in highly
creditable performances in the discus and the 2
mile run respectively. Both men took second place
in their events. — A great big bouquet to the ’Cat
netters for their highly successful invasion of the
North. The locals have already applied the white
wash to Lehigh and Penn State and by the time
that this reaches the street will have upset Yale’s
high-flying Bulldogs. The crucial Carolina match
is just around the corner also.

Austin Sparks
White Victory

Last Friday night under the
lights of Richardson , Field an
out-weighed, supposedly outclassed
White team beat the Black team
14-12 in a Wildcat intra-squad grid-
iron tussle. Bill Austin, flashy
White wingback, turned ‘in some
beautiful broken field running and
made both touchdowns and one ex-
tra point for the winning under-
dogs.

Early in the first half the Blacks
scored on a sustained drive with
Pahl scoring from the two. The
attempted conversion was blocked.
Bouncing right’ back into the run-
ning, the Whites connected with a
pass good for 30 yards, then gave
the ball to Austin who carried it
55 yards on a left end sweep for the
tally. Austin accounted for
extra point by running it over.

Again in the second half Austin
got away around his own left end,
this time galloping 40 yards to
pay dirt. Adams’ pass in the flat

the

| was good for the extra point.

The remaining highlight of the
game was Black tailback Cliff
Turner’s 50-yard touchdown trek.
Again the Blacks failed to come
‘through with the extra point and
the score stood 14-12. Turner’s

-| passing also looked pretty good.

Black fullback Carl Pahl injured
his collar bone during the first half
and had to leave in the middle of
a stellar performance... Bud. Fowle,
who relieved him of that position,
also showed up well. Most of the
boys on the squad got to play a
good part of the game. :
| The team’s blocking shows im-
provement. The running was nice
and our passing attack has im-
proved some but can use the week’s
drill that has been put on it this
week in preparation for the wind-
up game tonight.

Sponsored by the “D” Club the
game will be held on Richardson
Field at 7:30 tonight. Everybody

is invited.

Reports from Yankeeland seem

press, the racketCors are taking on
Georgetown University..in Wash-

Those who made the trip are Bo

Williams, and Don Hatch. In their
first two matches they came away
with shutouts, winning over both
Lehigh and Penn State, 9-0. This
raises their record-to 11 wins and

Hight Lettermen To Return

Looking a little bit into the fu-
ture, it if the Wildeat
squad will be even stronger next
year. The only serious loss will
be the departure of Buck Archer
from the ranks. But with the show-
ing put.on by the freshman and
sophomore members this year, it
doesn’t look as if Bill Lufler has
too much to worry about. Although
he hasn’t played much in the sin-
gles, Whit Cobb ‘is good for a
slot in the individual tilts. Still
swinging their rackets will be Rod-
dey,’ the two Kesslers, Glenn Tur-
pin, Gerrly Robinson, Don Hatch,
and Mike Williams.

We don’t know what sort of
schedule will be up for next sea-
son, but a good guess would be
that one of about the same strength
will be carded. Possibly Luff will
even make the going a little harder.
But from where we sit, whatever
the gang has to-do will be done
well, and we can look for more vic-
tories in the future for Davidson.

SAE’s Surge Into
Interfrat Lead

Jumping from fifth into first
place, the SAE’s dominated the
second week of inter-fraternity

softball by slugging out 4 wins in 5
starts. Nipping at their heels are
the SPE’s and Kappa Sigs with 4
and 2 records.

The league leaders climbed on top
of the heap by beating the KA’s,
Pikas, Phi and Pi Kaps,
while losing to the second place
SPE’s.

Gams,

After losing their first two con-
tests, the Sigmas made a fast re-
covery by taking 4 straight at the
expense of the Independents, Phi
Gams, Phi Delts, and SPE’s.

Meanwhile the SPE’s were trim-
ming the front running” SAE’s; the
Pi Kaps, and Independents, and go-
ing down before the hard hitting
Betas and Sigmas.

Starting off ahead, the KA’s and
Betas found themselves still tied,
but this time for fourth instead of
first place. KA took their single
win of the week from the Betas
and the Betas got theirs from the
SPEH’s.

The Pi Kaps were busy trouncing
the Pikas and KA’s but lost a trio
to the Phi Delts, SPE’s and SAE’s.
Also standing at 3 and‘3 are the
Phi Delts with wins over the Betas,
Phi Gams, Pi Kaps, and losses to
the Independents and Kappa’ Sigs.

Nearing the bottom we find the
Phi Gams, 2 and 4; Independents,
1 and 4; and the cellar Pikas with
zevo and 5. Since this may be a
bit confusing the scoreboard will
clarify the matter:
