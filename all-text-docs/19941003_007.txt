Article misrepresents Independents

Lend us an ear

Friday morning, SGA President Eric Rosenbach will present to the trustees
a proposal that students be allowed to sit on trustee committees. As it stands now,
students have neither a vote nor a voice on these committees which address every
aspect of campus life from financial policies to campus planning.

But the SGA had an unpleasant surprise last week. The proposal met
outright disapproval from the faculty, our supposed allies in battles with the
administration.

We are perplexed that the faculty do not support the proposal. The faculty
themselves won the right to be represented on trustee committees aay three
years ago. How quickly they forget the little people.

Perhaps the college believes the faculty have more right to representation
because the college is their employer. Perhaps the college believes that the
students are merely consumers of the college’s resources and not valuable
contributors. Yes, the faculty are here longer.than any one student, but-without
the students, we could hardly call Davidson a college.

-Rosenbach’s idea makes perfect sense. He is not even asking that students
have a vote on the trustee committees. All we need is to have a consulting voice
in matters that affect our lives. We all know that the real decisions are not made
at SGA or CCRL meetings. Yes, these groups can pass proposals and put
pressure on groups that have power, but, no, students do not have direct influence
on important decisions.

If the faculty cannot support us in our endeavour for representation, we ask
that they do not hinder us. Until the faculty and the students are represented in
the chambers that host the most important and influential debates on this
campus—those that determine the future ideals and image of our college—we
cannot consider ourselves a full part of our own college.

To the editors,
I was both shocked and
appalled at the inaccuracy
and lack of information in
last week’s article Indepen-
dent Representative Didn’t
Make Ballot. It is unfortu-
nate that such an important
issue was so lackadaisically
reported and crucial infor-
mation was left out.

While it is the responsi-
bility of the Independent
Senators to have an Inde-:
pendent placed on the ballot
for Homecoming queen, this
was aresponsibility we were
made aware of only at the
last minute. Never. having
served in this capacity be-
fore, we were understand-
ably unfamiliar with this re-
sponsibility, and contrary to
what the article suggested,
we had not been informed a

week in advance. Inthe end,
we struck acompromise and
attempted a fair selection
process, but unfortunately,
time had run out.

It is an unfortunate fact
that SGA elections and
Homecoming elections were
too close in time (nearly a
month closer than last year)
to allow the Senators time to
select a candidate properly,
it is also unfortunate that
those who were aware of the
situation well inadvance did
not make better plans for
such an eventuality. Inde-
pendents, as the description
would suggest, are not a
united group who sit down
to regular meetings. Choos-
ing a Homecoming candi-
date is not as easy a process
as it is for an eating house

and requires more planning’

than a few days notice al-
lows. I hope the organizers
of the Homecoming event
their great degree of culpa-
bility in the failure to in-
clude and Independent in the
Homecoming Courtthis year
and will make necessary
changes for the future to in-
sure Independents are not left
out again. While Daniela
Welsh suggests in the article
that the failure to have an
Independent in Homecom-
ing shows what the college
thinks of Independents, I
think the scant attention paid
this year to having an Inde-
pendentselected gives atruer
measure of respect for those
not in a‘social house.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Orr, ’95
Independent Senator

I like Ike, but .

To the editors,

_ Ike, you’re a great guy
and I love you as a team-
mate, but in the spirit of the
liberal arts education I’m
going to have to say you’re
wrong. There was a lot of
validity in your article about
the Confederate flag and I
think that people need to take

that into consideration when

flying it or wearing it, but
some of the stuff you said
last week overlooks some
very important facts.
Slavery ended a hun-
dred years ago. Blacks are

-not treated like animals. No

matter how anyone tries to
twist'the facts you just sim-
ply cannot say that things
have not gotten better since
slavery. And you admitted
that although you used the
facts I am about to use in a
different light. The fact that
the black middle class is
growing at twice the rate of

‘the white middle class and -

that they get 500 billion
hours in formal education
and 65% percent of them
hold prestigious jobs and that
they can produce such great
writers and other experts
does not prove that blacks
are superhuman but simply
that the system is improving
and that more opportunities
are opening to the black
population. It is not “‘be-
cause they are African-
American,” but because they
are equal and are finally get-
ting treated that way.

I think it is important to
ask ourselves, is prejudice
dead? No, it is not, but it
does not only exist in the
form of white against black.
The reason I do not use the
“politically correct” term
African-American is be-
cause itis prejudice. Itleaves
out all of the blacks who
trace their ancestries back to

the Caribbean and, like Ike’

said Jesus might have, to the

Middle East. It groups them
all under African-American
because that is where the
most vocal group comes
from. That is pretty blatant
prejudice.

And to your question
“What group could have en-
dured slavery and live to tell
about it?” The Jews lived
through it, The Christians
lived through oppression
worse than slavery and sur-

_vived. The various British

and Northern European
(Aryan) tribes were enslaved
by the Romans.

The pointis slavery was
a horrible institution of the
past. It is over now and the

.only way we are going to fix

the things it has done is to
work together, not against
each other, toward brotherly
harmony between all races,
sexes, and creeds.

takentime toread thoroughly
this week’s paper.

' What a good decision!
Having just finished reading

Bobby Ramsay’s excellent
interview with Donna Pe-
ters ’89, I must tell you how
splendid this whole issue is.
I read every article, looked
at every ad, and studies ev-
ery opinion. TI feel better-
informed about what-:is hap-
pening oncampus, what will
happen, and what has hap-
pened. I especially appreci-

ate the even-handedness of
the news coverage and the
depth of reports on student
activities. I guess this quali-
fies as fan mail. Thanks for
helping me pass my lonely
office hours productively
and enjoyably.

Sincerely,

Sara Beasley
