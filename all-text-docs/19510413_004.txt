THE DAVIDSONIAN

Guest Ministers of Spring Services Provide
New Features As Individual Counselors

This year’s Spring Services bring
an innovation in religious empha-
sis new to the Davidson campus.
There will, of course,’ be the usual
chapel and evening services, led
this year by Dr. Harry M. Moffett
of Austin, Texas. In addition to
these regular services, however,
there will be a system of individual
hall counseling under the super-
vision of various ministers from

the University of Texas, and Union
Theological Seminary. During the
past war he served as an Army
chaplain in the South Pacific thea-
ter. His hobby is music; his class
honors consist of the ranking of
salutatorian in college and a fellow-
ship while in seminary. He has had
considerable experience as a youth-
counselor. (Cardboard Village.)

These counselors will live in the
dormitories, will help supervise in-
formal evening bull-sessions, and
will be available for individual
counseling. These bull-sessions will
supplement Dr. Moffett’s talks and
will furnish an opportunity for the
discussion of student religious prob-
lems. The counselors themselves
will be rooming in the dormitories
with YMCA committeemen as their
hosts. Evening bull sessions will
be held at 10:30 in the halls and
will be similar to our usual prayer
meetings, with worship and discus-
sion led by the counselors. Such
get-togethers are planned for Sun-
day, Monday, and Tuesday nights.
The counselors will be available at
other times for personal advice and
discussion.

Following is a list of the counse-
lors, with brief notes on their pas-
torates and backgrounds:

Rifle Team Completes Season;
Final Record Stands At 18-7

The Rifle Team last week com-

pleted a highly successful season,
in which 18 matches were won and
only 7 lost, In addition to these
matches, the team placed 4th among
28 competing teams in tHe 3rd
Army Intercollegiate match. It
fired in the National Inter-collegiate
and also in the Hearst Trophy
_ Matches, results of which have not
yet been announced. However, it
is felt that the scores which are
‘believed to have been fired by the
team in those matches will. com-
pare very favorably with the high-
ranking teams. The team also fired
in the Charlotte Rifle Club Match-
es, winning 6 of the 10 first place
medals offered

The regular season matches con-
sisted principally of postal matches:
however, there were 5 shoulder-to-
shoulder matches. In these, yictor-
ies were scored over N. C. State
and over Wofford, while 2 close
matches were lost to a strong VMI
team and a match to ‘Clemson by
the very slender margin of 1821 to
1827.

The Captain of this year’s shoot-
ing Wildcats was Aubrey Miree,
who was also high scorer, and the
team was coached by Captain
Hood, of the Military Department
staff, assisted by Sergeant Butts.
In addition to the team captain,
other members of the team were:

Wallace W. Abbott. John L,
Baker, George Bason, Shelby Brid-
ges, Vernon Clifton, E, H. Cole-
man, Robert C. Garrison, Alan
Groseclose, Raymond Lynch, Wil-
liam L. Morris, Frank McCutchan,
Kenneth Parks, Lincoln B. Scott,
L. Duncan Smith, John P. Thomp-
son, Hallet S. Ward.

As none of its members gra@uate
this year, it is expected that the
Rifle Team will have an even
stronger season next year.

MOFFETT EXPERIENCED ..
(Continued From Page One)

his ministry has been conspicuous
in its service to college students.

In 1940 he was called to Liberty,
Missouri where his pastorate among
college students was continued at
the William Jewell College.

In 1941 he became pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of Co-
lumbia, Missouri. This church
served the University of Missouri,
Stephens College and Christian
College.

Dr. Moffett left Columbia to be-
come.the pastor of the University
Presbyterian Church in Austin,
Texas. This church serves the Uni-
versity of Texas and it is the seat
of the largest concentration of
Presbyterian students in the South-
ern Church, Its student program is
outstanding in both its activity and

its scope and has been the model
for the programs at many univer-
sity churches.

Dr. Moffett’s interest in the
youth work of the church’ has been
made manifest in activity during
his entire ministry. He was the Sy-
nod’s chairman of Young People’s
Conferences for Appalachian Syn-
od, one of the leaders in the youth
conferences of the Synod of Mis-
souri and since coming to Texas
he has been director of Young
People's Conferences for the Synod
of Texas for three years. He is in
constant demand as a speaker for
youth conferences because of his
clean and challenging mode of
speaking. His sermons and his lec-
tures are spiced with a brilliant wit,
and he is well acquainted with the
problems of college students.

Atlantic and in the Pacific areas. A
member of the Army Reserves,

onel, he is a graduate of Davidson
and of Union Seminary. He has
taken special courses in counseling
and in psychology, and should be
quite well-fitted for his work with
us at Davidson, (Duke, third floor
and east side.)

Dr. William C. Neil’s hobbies are
tennis and gardening. He is pas-
tor of the Lowell Presbyterian
Church and has received degrtes
from Davidson, Union Seminary,

Washington and I.ee and from
Union Seminary. He has had con-
siderable * experience in youth-

dent Body, Captain of the basket-
ball team, and a member of ODK
and of the “D"” Club. He was the
Davidson YMCA Secretary for two
years following his graduation from
college and is a very competent
youth-counseter. (Watts, upper two
floors.)

The pastor of the Smithfield
Presbyterian Church, Mr. Joseph
Lansinger, is unique among our list
of counselors; for his early train-
ing was received at Catholic sem-
inaries in Maryland. However, in
1940 he left the Roman faith to take
up work at Union Seminary prep-
aratory to ordination as a Presby-
terian minister. Mr. Lansinger has
had a wide experience in youth
work, is interested in music and
church architecture as hobbies, and
has served as a chaplain during
the last war. (Duke, west side and
middle.)

A notoriously nagging wife re-
lented and bought her husband
two neckties for his birthday. The
husband finding them on his dres-
ser, donned one and made a grand
entrance to breakfast.

“Hummph!” snorted the nagger
when she saw him. “So you didn't
like the other one, eh?”

College Receives Valuable Material
From Collection of Dr. Lafferty

The family of the late Dr. Robert H. Lafferty, 1899, have
recently presented the College Library with a valuable collec-

tion of “Davidsoniana”. In the

collection are early magazines,

annuals, invitations, clippings, ete. relating to Davidson College.
Such material is particularly welcomed as there is no source

from which it may be purchased.
It is the Library’s policy to keep
duplicate copies of all college pub-
lications-~student, faculty and ad-
ministration.

Some years ago when the old
Lafferty house on North Main
Street in Davidson was purchased
by the College, the family gave the
library a number of rare publica-
tions which had accumulated in
its hands over the years. There is
no family more thoroughly identi-
fied with Davidson than the Laf-
fertys. Dr. Robert Lafferty’s fa-
ther was the Rev. James S. Laf-
ferty, class of 1876. In the genera-
tion before him, the Rev. R. H.
Lafferty was a trustee of the Col-
lege beginning in 1850. In the
present generation are the two sons
of Dr. Robert Lafferty: Robert H.,
Jr, Class of ,1937 and John O.,
Class of 1938.

It is from such long-standing
loyalty to the ivstitution that Da-
vidson College draws its warmest
support, and it is irom such loy-
alty that it must depend for the
preservation of its traditions and
ideals.

says Mr. White, “The boys in the
four, five, and six positions are be-
ginsing to come through, and that
should help us. Louis Barnes, who
has been a little shaky lately, is
coming through, although he has
one or two bad holes, around.” Mr.
White’s hopes are high for more
wins by the locals, especially with
the playing of Hill, McLean, and
Cecil Brandon which have been
“holding up” lately.

William and Mary and Kalamazoo,
the Wildcats have shown a lot of
promise and have been rapidly
gaining that much needed exper-

The big question for Saturday
is whether or not the Cats have
gathered enough experience to out-
play the veteran Blue Devils, who
look from all angles to be fully
“loaded.”
