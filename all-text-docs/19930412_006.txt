Quaint Shops Lining Main Street Tell of Davidson's Tradition.

Town continued from page I

old photos, the smell of shaving
cream, and Mr. Norton’s welcom-
ing smile immediately offer a feel-
ing of nostalgia. Mr. Kenneth
Norton, the present owner of
Norton’s Barber Shop, took over
the business from his father, Hood
Norton, who opened the barber’s
shopin 1913 along withhis brother,
Rutledge Norton.

At that time the shop was lo-
cated next to the Soda Shop, but
was moved to its present location
in 1927. Mr. Norton remembers
the days when there were many
little “mom and pop” stores along
main street. “I’ve seen Davidson
change from horse and buggy days
to automobile days” he com-
mented.

Mr. Norton noted that the busi-

est time he has ever seen was dur- ,

ing World War II, when the col-
lege had a large ROTC depart-
ment, and 500 Army Air Cadets
were stationed in Davidson.
Twelve barbers were needed to

keep up with the demands for the -

haircuts.

When the men were ready for
their shaves, Mr. Norton and the
other barbers did 50 in one hour, as
the men lined up and went on. Mr.
Norton has. planned to retire in
June of this year, but will continue
to live in Davidson.

NUMBERS

Where’ sthe only placein town
to grab a thick milkshake, a “Big
O”, freshly made egg salad or a
creme cheese and olive sandwich?
The Soda Shop, of course. Lo-
cated next to the post office, The
Soda Shop is a true Davidson land-
mark, First opened in 1951 as The
M & M Soda Shop the quaint res-
taurant with wooden booths and a
screen door has been serving col-
lege students and Davidson resi-
dents ever since.

“When Murray and Mary first
opened the shop they would stand
behind the counter all day, Murray
making the sandwiches; Mary
making the “Big O’s” and working
the cash register. They wouldn’t
take your order or anything. You
had to write itdown onalittle scrap
of paper before they would serve
you,” Said Jay Wade ’79 whose
wife, Cary, took over operation of
the shop in 1991.

The Soda Shop has virtually
remained the same except for the
addition of a larger kitchen, new
night hours and the addition of
beertothe menu. Lookat the walls
the next time you’re there grab-
bing a quick bite to eat.

Old pictures of Davidson ath-
letes in action, memorabilia,
awards, and penants adorning the
walls give The Soda Shop its obvi-
ous charm,

The view down Main Street is one of the many memories students will take with hen as they leave.

while a small newspaper, has
served Davidson/Cornelius since
1948. The first publications of the
newspaper were only four pages
long, and featured articles only per-
taining to the local area.

The office is not large—yet
the stack of papers outside the white
door reveal the busy work that
goes on inside. The Mecklenburg
Gazzette now servesas a local liai-
son with county governments, and
isread in Davidson, Cornelius, and
Huntersville.

Nearby, trinkets fill the walls
of the Village Store. Owned and
operated by Irene and Taylor
Blackwell, The Village Store
serves as a great place for students
and townspeople to purchase ev-

erything from.birthday to gradua-
tion gifts. While the store has been
apart of Davidson’s history for the
past 27 years, the building itself
has been around much longer.
Originally built in 1903, the struc-
ture first opened as a aie and
Dime store.

The Village Store has always
had a good relationship with the
college as Mr. Blackwell has
worked in the Office of College
Relations and now helps to keep
students informed as owner of The
Mecklenburg Gazette.

A few doors down, Ms. Joyce
Patch and Ms. Barbara Freund
manage Main Street Books. The
bookstore, itself only six yearsold,
is located on its original hardwood

floors and books line the original
shelves. Of course, in 1903 the
shelves held clothing of “Archie
Brown’s Dry Goods Store,” but
they remain as a type of shelf that
is not made anymore.The owners
of the bookstore will tell you that
there is one spot on the floor that
has been recovered since 1903,
and that is the place where the
wood stove used to sit, which
heated Archie Brown’s store in the
winter.

Does our town have tradition?
You could probably say that.
Davidson's Main Street adds a di-
mension to the college and town
by preserving a setting not found
many places. It’s nice that some
things remain the same.

Jenkins Center Brings in Community

By Grey Timberlake

Many Davidson College stu-
dents have visited the Ada Jenkins
Center at least once during their
Davidson careers for acommunity
dinner, service program, or other
activity. However, very few col-
lege students realize that the build-
ing is not just a community center,
but also a historic site with mean-
ing for Davidson’s African-Ameri-
can community. Located on
Gamble Street in Davidson, the
building served as the school for
Davidson’s black children before
integration.

Prior to the 1930's,
Davidson’s black children attended

a small, poorly-equipped elemen- -

tary school. After a fire which
partially destroyed this school
building, Ms. Ada Jenkins started
the movementto buildanew school
for black children in Davidson.
Many members of Davidson’s
African-American community
helped in the effort, raising money

for the new school by selling hot
dogs, hamburgers, ice cream, etc.
Ms. Ada Jenkins sought to get fi-
nancial assistance and other re-
sources from Davidson College and
local businesses. Bricks from
Davidson’s old Chambers build-
ing, which burned in 1921, were
used in the construction of the new

"Despite segregation, this
much-improved facility
opened many doors for

African-Americans in
Davidson"

school. Finally, in 1937, the result
was the Ada Jenkins School. De-
spite segregation, this much-im-
proved facility opened many doors
for African-Americans — in
Davidson. In the 1960’s, gradual
desegregation of area schools be-
gan. In 1966, the Ada Jenkins
School closed as a result of inte-

gration. Afterwards, Davidson’s
black elementary-aged children
attended Davidson Elementary
School.

The Charlotte Mecklenburg
Board of Education still owns the
school and rents it to the town of
Davidson for $1 a year. Since the
building was opened as a commu-
nity center, financial difficulties
due to the aging of the building
have been a primary concern to
townspeople who want the build-
ing to be preserved. During last
school year, Davidson College stu-
dents joined many members of the
community in helping to paint and
renovate the old building.

Currently, ReverendRobertL.
Shirley serves as the Director of
the Ada Jenkins Families and Ca-
reers Development Center. Lead-
ers in Davidson’s African-Ameri-
can community help to run various
programs for people of all ages,
