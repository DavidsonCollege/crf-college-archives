Construction plans call for a
two story concrete building con-
sisting of an assembly room and
kitchen on the first floor with
a library and six classrooms on
the second floor.

The proposed building is to
be employed as s Sunday
School in the winter and a
vacation Bible School in the
summer. At present the Sun-
day School of the church in-
cludes 65 members divided
into six classes which meet
in one main room. Better fa-
cilities are a must if the ed-
ucational aspect of the
church is to function proper-
ly. .

For the past three summers
there have been approximately
200 students from the three Ne-
gro churches in Davidson at-
tending: the Bible School. At
present these churches — Pres-
byterian, Mcthodist, and Bap-
tist—do not have any building
in which to hold the Bible
School.

Previously the elementary
school .t Moék Hill was usod
for this purpose. but last. sum-
mer the county sechogl board
passed a ruling which prohibits
the churches’ use of the ele-
mentary. school for a vacation
Bible School. Furthermore, the

Bi-annual Bleeding
Scheduled Monday

On April 27, Monday, the;
Red Cross Bloodmobile will!
begin operations at 11:00
a.m. and close its doors
promptly at 4:30 p.m:!
Those students donating’
will receive a free Physical
Education cut on Monday
and Tuesday, April 27 and
28. and a free ROTC drill
cut on May 12.

“We did not have a very good

to accommodate such a large
group. Consequently, last year
the churches were unable to
sponsor such a Bible School.

Dr. Steples, Davidson Col-
lege chaplain, is working on
the possibility of having the
Bible Schoo! in the element-
ary school again this year,
since next year the churches
will probably be able to man-
age the program themselves,
but no positive results have
been announced.

Last year the Negro Presby-
terian Church invested $1000 in
purchasing three lots located
on. Depot Street across from
the Carolina Asbestos Company.
This land is to be used for the
educational building.

This year the church has as
a project:that of making a down
payment on the building. Mem-
bership pledges to date total

$2000, all payable by Decem-,

ber 1959. The church officials
feel that $4000 will enable them
to begin construction. The Pres:
byterian Church, U.S.A. will
possibly finanee the remainder
of the building .if the individ-
ual church can show’ sufficient
interest unaided.

James W. Howard, operator
of the science stock room of
Davidson College, provided
the above information about
the project of the church in
which he is an elder and as-
sistant superintendent of the
Sunday School. He comment-
ed that the educational build-
ing will be a definite asset
not only to the specific mem-
bers of the church, but to
all members of the David-
son community. James How-
ard states with vunparaliel
conviction, “I believe that
this time next year we will
have an educational build-
ing.”

James has been associated
with Davidson College for ten
years, operating the science
stock room, receiving telephone

the table. He stares at the emp-
ty cigarette box, which he flips
constantly.)

Catherine: Don't you just
adore the Duke? I think he’s
the greatest!

Bill; (Looking up, smiling)
He’s great all right, but you
should have heard the King-
ston Trio. Now, there's a cool
bunch of guys! Smooth, man!

Catherine: Oh, YES, I saw
them when they were at Fancy
Dress. Remember the onc that
played the banjo—the middle-
sized one? (Bill mods, he re-
members) I think he’s the
cutest thing that I have ever
seen. (Bill smiles) He and Rock
Hudson could have me any-
time! (Bill laughs).

Bill: Did you see Hudson in
“Torrid.” (Shaking head in
amazement) Boy, he was sharp!

of it?

Bill: (Hesitantly) Well, 1 liked
it, but it was hard to under-
stand. I think Faulkner was try-
ing to say something in that
deaf-mute uncle, but I couldn't
catch it. (Grinning) I guess I
should have studied English
more than I did. (Obviously he
doesn't believe this)

The final issue of Scripts ‘n

‘given out in chapel today. |

“It's our greatest effort,”
said Editor Bob Cole as he

it had to make this the best is-,

sue ever.”

Cole went on to explain that
the fourth issue, usually en-
tirely composed of literary
works, had been dropped this
year. “Not many students read
it, so we decided to use the
money usually used to put out
the literary issue into the one
published this week,” Cole con-
tinued.

“We believe that most of the
students want a magazine with
a lot of humor in it. They also
want a local touch to it. That's
what we've tried to give them,”
Cole concluded.

UAR's A. Hassan: ‘We

Want To Be

Left Alone’

Mr. A. M. Hassan, a distinguished U.N. delegate,
spoke in chapel yesterday on the United Arab Republic
and the United Nations. Mr. Hassan is currently the di-

rector of the Press Bureau of the Permanent Mission of
the Arab Republic to the U.N.

Sponsored by the YMCA, Mr.
Hassan spoke to interested stu-
dents in the Union on Wednes-
day night and was avail:
day night and was available for
questions concerning his work.

“We don’t know how to
please you,” concluded . Mr.
Hassan. “Before the UAR
is formed, you agree that
Syria will become Communist
unless she joins with Egypt.

Catherine: Oh, Bill! Jayne| Now you decry and criticize

heard about her. She is sharp!

Mr. Hassan spoke at some
length about tho relation of
foreign aid to the young,
building nations of the world.
“The essential item determin-
ing and indicating the effec-
tiveness of aid is the appre-
ciation it reccives. If the Unit-
ed States had given aid to the
peoples of Asia and Africa
from the end of World War
\t rather than spend if upon
an ungrateful Franco, the
present results of your aid
might be more positive.

Russisa has extended help

‘of penetration: they have

achieved greater success be-
cause of a better defined poli-
cy, but have failed where they
expected a committing re-
sponse.”

The Israeli question was re-
current throughout the discus-
sion. “Israel lives on money
from your nation, receiving aid
equal to the help given to 10
Arab nations with a population
of 50 million. It cannot be a
growing concern since it is not
self-sufficient. It is only a sup-
position, and has failed to show
the elements of boundary.
homogeneity, government, and
productivity necessary to con-!
stitute ‘a state.”

When asked if he felt the
Arabs might ever compro-

mise, Hassan responded with
a quick and emphatic “No.
But we don’t need to drive
the Jews out of Israol; they’il
drive themselves out. With-
out aid, Israel will bury it-
self.”

Throughout the discussion
tan the spirit of nationalism of,
the Arab world, and Hassan im-!
pressed it once again upon the’
often stubborn and resistant
American and Davidson minds!
at the evening’s close. “We just
want to be left alone. People
want to be in their home, to
live with their history, their
heritage, their whole being.”
