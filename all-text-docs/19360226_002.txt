Davidson should have at least one man in this
yeat’s Flaming Five. There has been a Wiideat
on this seleet group ever since it began about six

_ years ago. so let's sendin our ballots and get
another or even several in 19306.

Hell Week...

In quite a number of colleges thronghoat the
South “lel! Week" is being abolished. _ Accor
ing to che newSpapers from these schools. this
sudden wiping out of such # nation wide and
age old tradition is due to, fundamentally. ‘the
rapidity with which the world is progressing and
to take “tme-out.”’ which is actually what happens
during “Heil Week.” for the unprofitable aetivi-
ties, resulting therefrom, is not just obviously
foolish, but actualty regressive.

After all what good can either an upperclass-
man ot freshman gain by humiliating a pledge,
to the extent that it reflects upon the saneness
of the members of the fraternity. Few of us
can plead ‘“not-guilty” of the charge, but all of
us, I believe, can readily perceive the utter fu-
tility of it 4) constructive institution in the
year's routine,

It would irrevocably be a step forward for the
fraternities at Davidson to cast into the junk
heap this worn out custom, and employ helpful
methods of disciplining the pledge groups,

Stop This “Sudden Death”

Along with many other constructive moves
that have emanated in recent months from the

students at the University of North Carolina is’

a “Safety Driving Campaign.” “And Sudden
Death" ihat amazing article which appeared in
Readers Digest just before Christmas, and has
been reprinted more than 3,000,000 times since,
has inspired a natidnwide interest in the need for
encouraged safer operation of motor vehicles.
Since North Carolina takes the lead among the
list of per-capith deaths from automobile acci-
dents, it is very appropriate that this state take
the initiative in blotting ‘out dts careless menace.
which makes us ride the highways with an agon-
izing_eye continually glowing ahead for - fear
“Sudden death” may be just around the gorner.

All Things Come...

So numerous are the tangible needs on the
Davidson campus that it seems almost like add-
ing insutt to injury when one of them is men-
tioned, but sotnetimes fiery insult heaped upon
equally painful injury brings action when noth-
ing else will. Therefore. we revive the hankering
for 4 new infirmary, a desire which seems to have
long satee passed the simple “needy stage” into
that of dire necessity. -

The building now being used to howse tem-
poranly disabled Davidson students was built
hack almost betore the ume when “man’s mem-
ory Tunneth not to the contrary.” It is out of
date in every respect. When the front door is
opened patients ere practically compelled to take
hold of the mattress so they will not roll from

| their tottering beds onto the floor.

Fireplaces in every room provide a very in-
conversemt and inadequate heating arrangement,
and .the windows which rattie with a “haunted
house” echo, keep out just enough cold air to
prevent the occupants from freezing.

‘This may sound somewhat jallacious, but ask
Mrs. A. DB. “Mother”. Rohson. who has for
twenty eight years ministered unseltishty and un-
tiringly to the physical ailments of Davidson
students. Through these nearly three decades
this same old building, that was somewhat anti-
quated in £908. has been used as the college in-
lirmary, but she goes ahead from day to day,
wishing that a new building could be provided
to take care of the sack students. but despite the
uncomfortable quarters, her continual cheerful-
ness, helpful service. and the willingness of her
assistants make the place bearable for the few
patients who can be aecommodated.

No plaee is available in the old structure for
the equipment of Dr, MacConnell. tlte College
physician. Therefore. he is unable to treat con-
rvemeéndly patients who require the use of special
medical appliances. Nevertheless. it is unneces-
sary to enumerate the many inadequacies of the
present bospital. The growing need for-a-new
one ts irrevocable.

Tt isn't a necessity that an extremely large one
he built, but a well equipped building with beds
for about forty patients cold comiortably take
care of the most illnesses Davidson would have
at any one time.

A new infirmary seems to be the most urgent
of our tremendously useable additions at David-
son, so we place it tirst in the tist witha new gym-
nasium, a new library, and a new social center.

How funds to ereet these buildings can he
secured is the main difficulty, but an awier yewage
promises that “all shings come to those bh Sait

However, practically a hundred years waiting
hast broagit Davidson a aew infirmary, 50 we
had better abide by the weil-known saying which
iclls as that: “The Lord helps those who help
themselves.”

Jetis talk up the needs wherever we go anc!
help ect a new infirmary and these other things
tor Davidson before the Centennial Cciehration
in 937.

In order to durther this very worthy measure,
pamphlets on the subject “Guides to Highway
Safety” have heen issued by the Institue of Gov-
ernment and he Duly Tar eel at Chapel Hill.
Several hundred copies of these very informative
booklets have heen sent to cach of 2 great number
of colleges and universities throughout the U. S..
and Rawdson has been included in this group.
There are not enough for every niember of the
Student Body to have one, but each man should
tard access to one and glean from it such start-
ling statistics as “motor accidents caused 36,000
deaths and almost one million injuries last year
alone.

“In all the wars of our history 244,357 Amer-
icans were killed. In automobile accidents which
took place in the U. S. between 1920 and 1935,
388,936 persons lost their lives.

“The National Highway death rate is 23.2 per
10,000,000 gallons of gasoline consumed.

“One out of every nine persons killed
child playing in the street.

“The week-end is the most dangerous part of
the week. On Sunday almost twice as many
people are killed as on Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday.

“One-third of-alt fatalities that occur on high-
ways take place during’ the five hours between
3 P. M.and $ P.M.

“Speeding and reckless driving cause one-third
of all fatalities that drivers are responsible for.”

Carelessness—don't give a hurrah—is char-
acteristic of each above stated fact, which clearly
shows that the abolition of this menace is possible
in a civilized country as the U. S. haughtily
claims to be. .

This woble work of North Carolina students if
highly commendable, and we invite your religiotis
scrutiay to the contents of this carefully pre-
pared booket, and urge your conscientious heed-
ing of the guiding advice it sets forth.

Copies will be placed in the various dormitories,
where the first-comers may secure them. How-
ever, after carefully reading it pass it on to some-
ane who hasn't had an opportunity to see it.

And Yet Once
More Into the Breach

A number of the boys captured
the front row and wormed into the
balcony to hear a magnificent
voice, Lawrence Tibbett. They saw
a, handsome six-footed personality :
at times Don Juan, in turn Emperor
Jones. John Highlandman = and
Tommy Atkins. They were well
satisfied, tho’-the program was a
bit unfamiliar. As_usual, we liked
the encores best. Tibbett even put
a new lacquer on the musical ban-
ality, “Shortnin’ Bread.” and de-
lighted his audience with modern
satirical notes. And we admire his
personality. The Great American
Tragedy is that culture is repre-
sented in funny haircuts, bewilder-
ing beards, and unfortunate man-
nerisms, —

Observations

Interesting it is to notesthe be-
haviour of the typical’ American
audience when favored with an en-
core, oasis in a classical desert. We
go wild. It is like eating spinach
blindfolded and finding a spoonful
of ice cream. Like mecting your
next door neighbor after a painful
drive through enemy territory. Like
looking through a geometry book
and finding an arithmetic problem
you can work. It is occasionally
irksome to see an -audience — sit
stotidly through an hour of splendid
and not difficult music and then
rise in paroxysms of applatise-over
the same hammered and hackneyed
street and radio songs.

Practica? Minds

For Managing Editors Hal Ov-
erton and John Winn, whose usual-
ly frolicsome minds and unbur-
dened souls are. bound in and clut-
icted by Fs Fonetrable figures, and
for all others whose cyes are en-
circled and whose holidays are non-
existent, we, have composed this
dirge, elegy or what-have-you:

IN MEMORIUM

Here lies Ezra Josephus Blue,

He survived pneumonia and the
flu.

Of sparkling youth he was the

fountain,
But it warnt no use,
He took Accounting.

And lest we be accused of being

frivolous (which added to the al-

ready accumulated accusations of
being a sour-faced cynic, a milk-
fed reformer. a rebellious iconoclast
etc. would make quite an indict-
ment), may we hasten to add that
Accounting and other — business
courses are praised by atumni as

being the most essential - and
worthwhile courses received in
college.

A psychology professor at Bos-

that such procedure substitutes the
hand for the brain and_ still- gives
a very poor reproduction of his
lectures. May his tribe increase!
‘The Tables Turned’—

The students at Catawba College
enjoyed a Leap Year Dance recent-
ly. The affair was carried out in
true leap year style. Some of the
girls even went to far as to send
corsages to their dates.

Logic—

A Carolina economies elass was
involved in discussion. centering
around the law of supply and de-
mand, “What,” rasped the — pro-
fessor.” is the result when prices

classroom spoke up: “Why uh-ub,”
he stammered, “things are, cheap-

Punch quotes a psychologist who

Paid in Full—

A certain Doctor of Randolph-
Macon College went into/a’ local
merchant's to pay a bill, Upon
inquiring the amount’ he owed, he
pulled out a moth-eaten checkbook
and proceded_to“write a check. His
errand over, the venerable Doctor
turned and’ crossed ‘the threshold
to freedom. Imagine the merchant's
surprise when he received a curt
note from his bank-demanding ex-
planation. It seems that the noble
Doctor had made the check out to
himself and signed the merchants
naine to it!

Around Washington

By ARNOLD SERWER

Washington, D. © — No ond ciat graduate coutses to be taken

thinks of Washington except as the
seat of the nation’s government,
yet-this city has another, although
lesser claim to distinction, and that
is its importance as a college town.
For Washington has four univer-
sities and a number of small col-
leges within the city limits, all of
them doing quite well from the
standpoint of student enrollment.

The. universities are Georgetown,
George Washington University,
Catholic University and American
University. Wilson Teachers Col-
lege, Columbia College of Law, and
the Washington Law School are a
few of the colleges. Probably the

efirst, three of the four universities

tained are the only ones known to
people outside the District of Co-
lumbia, mainly by virtue of what
publicity their athletics get from
time to time. The fourth, Ameri-
can University, although one of the
outstanding graduate schools in the
country, commands little or no na-
tional press mention.

The composition of. the student
bodies of these schools is rather
interesting. The sons and daugh-
ters of government employees and
officials of varying importance, of
legislators having semi-permanent
residence here, and of foreign dip-
lomats make up the greatest part of
their enrollments. Many an out
of-town student of a middle class
family casually bringing home the
son of an ambassador for the
Christmas holidays, has thrown his
friends and relations into a state
bordering on panic. How, they
wonder, did their William achieve
enough sangfroid to be capable not
only of taking an ambassador's son
calmly, but of referring to the
aforesaid ambassador as “Tubby's
old man?”

Hundreds of undergraduate stu-
dents here are completing courses
of study in night classes and work-
ing for the government during the
day. Those who are able to secure
government jobs and work © and
study under those --conditionsare
really fortunate, because their sal-
aries more than suffice to maintain
them. This arrangement has been
successfully managed by many law
students and those taking general
courses in letters and science.

Additional hundreds of persons
working for the government, al-
ready having degrees, enroll in spe-

fect, regretting Skinny Lowrance.

the Week.

at night. The graduate
ran by the Department of Agricul-
ture are extremely popular with
those making a career of govern-
ment service. Statistics, economics,
accounting, government administra-
tion, world affairs, and dozens of
other courses are offered by the de-
partment. These courses are ac-
credited by the country's leading
universities, particularly the courses
in statistics, a field in which the
department's instructors — excell
since manysof them are government
statisticians of national standing.

in a sense, students at cach of the
schools consider the whole town
their campus more than the few
acfes, about the college buildings.
They mingle readily and naturally
with the scores of young college
trained New Dealers who not
long ago were undergraduates
themselves at the leading universi-
ties of the country. You find them
at the same lectures, the same open
dances, the same concerts.
