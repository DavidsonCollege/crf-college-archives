The Honor System On Trial ?

An examination of the stories in this
week’s DAVIDSONIAN will reveal the
fact that this campus and its students
have become victims to the most
widespread rash of thievery that
Davidson has witnessed in recent
years.

Davidson has been in session scar-
cely a month, and already 26 bicycles
have been reported missing or stolen.
Even more alarming than this is the
fact that $2000 worth of cash and
valuables have been stolen from the
dorms, an amount greater than the
reported total for all of the past aca-
demic year.

As if this weren’t enough, Director of
the Slater Food Service Ron Scott has
charged that students are taking food
from the eating houses, and
not paying for it with meal tickets.
And in a memo to the Library Com-
mittee, Director of the Library
Chalmers Davidson has stated that
electronic detection devices might
have to be installed in the new Little
Library to attempt the halt the loss of
library books.

The implications of these events on
the whole atmosphere of trust and
honesty that in the past has been a
trademark of Davidson could be
far-reaching. Grumbles of discon-
tentment with the Honor System here
have been minimal in light of the
present seriousness of the problem, but
we wonder how much longer such
passive acceptance will prevail.

At this point, we do not feel that the
Honor System is itself seriously on
trial. Indications are that much of the
dorm, bicycle, and library book thefts
may be tracable to outsiders of the im-

mediate college community.

However, Davidson students cannot
escape scot-free as there is still the
Slater food problem and_ the
mysterious loss of ten odd bound
volumes of library periodicals among
other things to explain.

We would guess that the blame for
these thefts could probably be affixed
to a small handful of students, an in-
significant number in relation to the
community as a whole. Unfortunately,
the repercussions of their behavior is
far more serious than their number.

It would be unrealistic to expect that
college officials could apprehend all

those involved. Instead, the entire
community must act to stop this
problem.

Students must be more alert to the
dangers, and not tempt the sometime
thief by leaving their valuables out in
the open just daring him to take them.
By this, we are not advocating a full-
scale lockup of the campus, but rather
a more realistic approach to security

Furthermore, everyone must be
more self-appraising in his attitude

_toward the Slater people and the

library. The temporary elation of a
petty rip-off of some food or the illegal
borrowing of a book may be satisfying,
but in the long run the entire com-
munity will suffer expecially if Slater
clamps down with tighter surveillance,
and the library installs electronic
protection devices.

So to insure that the Honor System
does not become threatened by a
serious trial, everyone here must do
his or her part to promote personal in-
tegrity on the campus.

No Refund On Commitment

During the past week, 203 Davidson
College students requested and
received $3 refunds from the Davidson
chapter of the North Carolina Public
Interest Research Group (NC PIRG).

The $609 refund total left the David-
son chapter contributing only slightly
more than $2000 to the statewide fund
raising campaign.

The NC PIRG program at Davidson
allows individual students an excellent
educational opportunity beyond the
limits of the Chambers classrooms.

However, many Davidson students
have found a $3 refund preferable to
the potentially great benefits their
meager contributions could help to
bring about.

Last spring when the PIRG method
of funding was overwhelmingly ap-
proved by the the students, PIRG
agreed to refund on request each
student’s $3 contribution which is ad-
ded to the school comprehensive fee.

Many students this year decided to
take full advantage of the refund op-
tion. Whether the response to the
refund policy on the part of these 203
students was pro -— by negative at-
titudes toward NC PIRG or the in-
dividuals’ need for the return of $3, the

refunds have cost the students of
Davidson College and the people of
North Carolina a substantial price in
the lost potential to effect change in the
public interest.

Fine Arts Dilemma

While understanding the need to
establish priorities in accord with the
financial situation today, and the im-
plications of our own editorial position
that a new Union is a vital necessity to
the college, we feel that Davidson
must also make plans for improved
Fine Arts facilities.

For with the increased interest on
the part of the males in the Arts over
the last ten years, and with the in-
troduction of females who undoubtably
will express a strong vearning for
them too, it becomes doubly important
that the Arts also be awarded a high
priority for improvement

Davidson must respond to the wishes
of these students, and somehow tind
the money to improve these deplorable
conditions, too.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Rabil Relates Real
Governance Results

Tothe Editor:

1 would like to pop a few
idealistic bubbles in regard to
the directions Davidson is
headed in governance.

The new governance system
will perhap s be functional, but
it will not be a great step toward
community. This has been

by the com-
mittee on governance.

The governance committee is
praising itself for arriving at
the new system through “par-
ticipatory democracy”’ (refer to
“The Year in Prospect’’).

This very term is an ex-
pression of alienation. It denies
the assumed existence of com-
munity.

In regard to students, they
should not be allowed a role in
the decision-making process
because‘ _ their interests are
being affected’’ there.

They should have a role
because they are simply a
respected and integral part of
the Davidson Community, the
‘community of learners.”’

The governance committee
has failed to see that com-
munity is based on openness. If
openness is not present, com-
munity is extinguished. But if
no mutual respect is present on
everyone's part, openness will
tend not to be present either.

A committee of 50 percent

PICTURE TO THE EDITOR

students and 50 percent faculty
could arrive at a decision just
as closed and secretively as an
all-faculty committee.

Simply because a student is
involved does not mean that
students are involved when
that one student’s involvement
is confidential.

By i ting into our
ideals that ‘‘participatory
democracy is good and an end
in itself,’’ we are freezing the
existing states of alienation
rather than integrating mem-
bers of a community.

By creating the most
we are not creating either the
most efficient system or the
best system for an educational
institution.

Our present system is con-
venient, efficient, functional. If
we could just get it out of the
back rooms and into the open
we would solve 90 percent of our
problems without changing a
word in the present con-
stitutional documents.

The reform we need is a
behavioral one, not a _ con-
stitutional one. Any reform that
does not result in an increase in
efficiency or openness is no
reform at all.
