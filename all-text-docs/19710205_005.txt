What Do You Want To
Be When You Grow Up?

Last week we took: a look
at the farce called the
Placement Interview; it’s
neither a good way to get a
job nor a good way to decide
which job to get.

Concerned about the un-
certainties of graduate ad-
mission, the required high
finance, and the paucity of
the alternatives, 1 expressed
my frustrations to Suzie
Summers who heads the
placement service.

BETTER FACILITIES, CAMERA SPUR INTEREST ‘

Student Filmmaking On Increase

By GRAY WILSON
Managirig Editor
Student film-making is tlie
coming thing on campuses
all-over the nation, and an
improvement in facilities at
Davidson’ College may _ in-
crease the output of movies

here in the near future.

Although films are not a
novelty on campus, the new-
ly-purchased college movie
camera and efforts to offer
a film course at Davidson
are sure to encourage pro-
spective filmmakers,

The new camera, open to
general student use for a
nominal fee, has already
been rented for two films.
The first students to rent
the ¢amera Were George Al-
len, Dick Hinson, and Steve
Engstrom.

Hinson explained that - the
film, which will include one
major actor and several
minor parts, was undertaken
solely as ‘‘a learning ex-

perience,
“In the framework of a
documentary, we want to

capture the subjective. ex-
perience of an alienated in-
dividual who is trying to

- film Alan Baragona in‘ student-made movie “Dunn.

communicate to others,"’
The film may run up to
45 minutes ijn-Jength when
completed, ahd it will have
a sound track dubbed in
after the editing is finished.
According t6 Hinson: ‘The

film. in general is still re

garded as a form of super:
fluous entertainment, but we

‘think it is a valid art form.”

iLast weekend the school
camera “was used again for
the filming of *‘Dunn,” a 15.
20 minute sketch of a mind
burdened by feelings of sex-
ual guilt.

Sophomore Bill Rolland is
producing the film, and John
Davidson is operating the
camera, Most of the shoot-
ing takes place in a local
boarding house, and _ there
may be one scene taken in
the Union Bar, according to
one of the actors.

Dialogue will be added to
the movie, but there will be

no actual synchronization of

the sound with the lip move-
ments of. the actors.

A course in film is offered
presently -on independent
study by the Fine Arts de-
partment, which has an

identical camera to the one
recently purchased for’ gen-
eral student use.

Junior Frank Soos produc-
ed a film in the Fall term
under this program. He calls
it ‘a chain of thought film,
which drifts from a stream
of ¢onsciousness to isolated
events of reality in a per:
son’s mind.”

Soos said that the main
character was cast as a drug
user to put the movie in a
modern context. The film
will be accompanied by a
sound track taken from
‘Soft Parade’’ by The Doors,
but there will be no actual
dialogue because of a ‘‘lack
of facilities.”

Editing of the film is still
in progress, but the actual
length of the final product
will run about 10 minutes.
Soos pointed out certain
equipment problems and
added that “It takes about

‘five or six hours to get one

minute. of film."

During the Winter term of
last year, one studio class
produced a 10 minute movie
which received ‘‘honorable
menhtion’’ at the Mint Mu
seum Film Festival in Char:
lotte.

The movie was an animat-
ed cartoon (no title) drawn
with magic marker and _ In-
dia ink and captured on 16
mm film. The rock opera
“Tommy" provided the
soundtrack.

One member of the-class
said, ‘‘The movie had no
theme. It consisted of car-
toon images that went along
with the music.”

(Professor of Fine Arts
Herb Jackson, encourages
film-making through his de-
partment or with the new
college camera. ‘“‘The more
the merrier,”’ Jackson said.
“I'd be glad for every de-
partment en campus | to
sponsor anything visual,”

Jackson stated that there
was a request now before
the Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC) to introduce 4
film course into the curri-
culum for next year. if the
EPC clears the proposal,

ways of looking at the pro-

las Houchens, who is away
from campus this year.

On the national scene stu-
dent film-making has _in-
creased dramatically. Sixty-
eight colleges, are providing
degrees jin film this year,
and there are 75 movie com
petitions which may be en-
tered by . student filmmak-
ers.

Thomas Fensch, author of
a new book entitled ‘‘Films
on the Campus: Cinema Pro-
duction in Colleges and Uni-
versities,’’ states that in-
struction in movie-making
“is a phenomenon not easily
paralleled in the history of
American higher education.

“The demands for film
courses and financing for
equipment: have come from
students instead of from uni-
versity administrations."

iFensch, who teaches jour-
nalism’ at Shippensburg State
College, commented _ that
students ‘‘have forced  uni-
versity officials to hire pro:
fessors to teach film courses.

there is no room in the col

Festival, which drew 347 en-

everything from a 45-minute
documentary called ‘*Chica-
go’ to a 2%-minute com-
mentary on the nation today

Smith cautioned that he

The second point to pond-

Some of us don’t plan to
