Charlotte's Gallery Crawl:
Friday's Artistic Alternative

By Jim Carswell

Every weekend at Davidson
students are barraged with a myr-
iad of evening entertainment pos-
sibilities. One might immerse the
self in two of the greatest Ameri-
can forms of expression by visit-
ing Cathy’s and Little Caesar’s
and returning to the privacy of a
VCR-equipped dorm room. Orhow
about revelling in the Bacchana-
lian and sweaty delights of aCourt
or hall party? For the faint of heart,
there is always pleasure to be
gleaned from reading next week’s
assignment in that eerily engross-
ing History of Numerology course.
The list goes on...

But this Friday, and the first
Friday of every month, one can
very easily and inexpensively break
the routine by visiting Charlotte
for the Gallery Crawl at Spirit
Square. Held at six uptown Char-
lotte galleries surrouding the cor-
ner of Seventh and Tryon Streets,
the event proposes to promote the

Film Review:

visual arts in the Carolinas’ most
progressive city. The atmosphere
is cool, the art varied, and the price
free, sohead down there this week-
end.

All of the galleries are open,
and each presents its own particu-
lar offering. Wine is the accompa-
nimentto local artists’ works at the
Hodges Taylor and Grosse Galler-
ies, and Spirit Square serves hors
d’oerves with its exhibits of locals
and a changing featured artist,
Linda Kroft this week. Admirers
of Paul Rousso’s work will enjoy
his gallery, while devotees of New
York artists will want to visit the
Jerald Merberg Gallery. The Ar-
tesino usually presents an interest-
ing mix of local and various other
artists.

And the crowd often varies as
much as the art. But the wandering
college student blends just as well
with the uptown Charlotte yuppy
as with the long-haired and occa-
sionally nose-ringed member of

Dead Again:

Kenneth Branagh's Latest Film is
This Summer's "Must See" Thriller

By David Thompson

Kenneth Branagh’s latest
work, Dead Again, testifies to the
creativity and daring of this out-
standing young film maker. After
resounding critical and commer-
cial success with his film adapta-
tion of William Shakespeare’ s
Henry V, Branagh takes a brave
step into the realm of the mystery
thriller.

The story, by Scott Frank, is a
cunningly crafted tale of love,
money, deceit, musical composi-

tion, hypnotic suggestion, jealousy, ©

and reincarnation. As the film
opens, headlines cross the screen
touting the arrest, conviction and
execution of composer Roman
Strauss (Branagh), for the murder
of his wife, Margaret (Emma Th-
ompson). Only moments later,
however, the scene changes to an
orphanage in present day Los An-
‘geles where a mute, amnesiac
woman (Thompson, again) has
been found. To her. aid comes
private investigator Mike Church
(Branagh, again), who attempts to
help her discover who sheis. With
the help of a rather odd antique
dealer with a pe

tism (Derek Jacobi), the unknown
woman explores her sub-con-
scious. Strangely enough, the sub-
conscious she explores seems to
be that of Margaret Strauss, the
victim of the aforementioned mur-
der. Along with the characters on
screen, the audience spends the
remainder of the film wondering
who may or may not have killed
whom ina past life and who may or
may not wish to enact revenge in
this one.

It seems a confusing mixture,
and likely would be without Bran-
agh’s terse direction. With all the
bravado of Orson Welles’ Citizen
Kane, Dead Again invites the
audience to unfold the plot along
with the characters, rather than
listen as they tell the story. With
the same intensity that one follows
thei investigation conducted by the
reporter in Kane, a viewer of Dead
Again becomes actively engaged
in the character judgments and as-
sumptions which are central to this
film.

Branagh manipulates his audi-
ence with his deft manuevering of
the camera. A particularly well

the local “art scene.” And, while
the Gallery Crawl does at times
exude the air of a purely social
event, the feeling that these people
are simply there to enjoy art per-
vades as well. It truly is a break
from the atmosphere of a dorm
room or party.

So, if you are bored with the
regular scene around here, or just
want an intellectual and artistic
prelude to yournormal Friday night
festivities, try the Gallery Crawlin
Charlotte. To make it even easier,
the Union Gallery Committee runs
a bus service there and back. For
reservations, call Stewart Lathan
at -6813.

Or if you are on your own, go
south on I-77 until you reach the
Brookshire Freeway. Exit there and
head east, getting off at the Tryon
Street exit. Turn right and drive
until you hit Seventh Street. The
art is centered around that corner.
Parking is free on College Street,
and it lasts from 6 until 8 p.m.

handled episode depicts an eleva-
tor ride in a municipal mental in-
stitution. Branagh’s clinical and
unsympathetic photography of the
bizarre acts of the inmates reflects
the horrifying coldness with which
the guards handle the patients’
outbursts.

Branagh tends to shoot Th-—
ompson lovingly, yet without the

tiresome devices with which gentle |

heroinesare usually filmed suchas
the backlighting of Glenn Close in
The Natural.

In the final scene, Branagh’s
carefully choreographed melee fo-
ments the fear and anticipation of
the audience by injecting a con-
structed ambiguity regarding the
characters position onscreen. The
scene works brilliantly and should

prove jarring toeven the mostjaded |

audiences.

The film’s greatestassets, how-
ever, are the performances ren-
dered by its stars. With a pair of
much studied accents, Branagh

plays the German-born Romanand
Californian-bred Mike. His por-
