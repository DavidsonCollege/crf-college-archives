A Gothie Turn

All of a sudden, Davidson’s govern-
ment has taken a Gothic turn. How
late may the mysterious houses of
Patterson Court be occupied these
dark and stormy nights? The answer
remains hidden deep within the re-
cesses of Chambers’ first floor.

The issue of curfews on the frater-

nity court has been a Jive one for
years, each year bringing new pro-
posals for chan n the present sit-

uation. Whe IFC and the RHC both
decided, in the fall of this year, that
the situation had been batted around
long enough and proceeded to recom-
mend complete abolition of fratern-
ity court hours.

In light of the importance of stu-
dent. responsibility to those who pre-
sently attend this college and its clear
manifestation in the Code of Respon-
sibility, this action should have sur-
prised no one.

It now appears, however, that the
recommendation not only surprised
the Administration, but resulted in a
severe state of shock to that estate
of the realm which has brought with
it a total paralysis of the facilities of
rational thought.

This diagnosis is based on recent
statements by members ofthe Ad-
ministration which place fraternity
hours in “Limbo.” What does this
mean? Well, it means that the recom-
mendation has been made and’ that
the rules in question are now in “The
Twilight Zone.” Got that?

The reason for this obfuscation is
obvious. Confronted with the uncom-
fortable choice between accepting the
proposal, and thus drawing fire from
the various groups who oppose the
liberalization of campus regulations,
or rejecting it, thus mobilizing student
opinion, the Administration has creat-

ed a third option: ignoring the situa-
tion entirely, old rules included.

The matter is in the “Twlight Zone”’
and that’s definite.

What Davidson's students are con-
fronted with, then, is not a policy
but a non-policy, an antipolicy if you
will. Those who are responsible, in
the final analysis, for governing their
School refuse to take any position on
an issue related to student conduct.

The course, for students, in the
face of this purposeful obstructionism,
is clear. The Code of Responsibility
states that, save in cases where spe-
cific rules are in effect, the purposes
of the College are best served by al-
lowing the student to make his own
choices on conduct, free from unneces-
sary restrictions.

Since a non-policy can in no way
be a specific rule, it must be assumed
that the Code takes precedenée in this
case, and that, this being the case,
students are no longer bound by the
old regulations. It is our recommenda-
tion that students completely disre-
pe all past dictates concerning cur-
ews, ~

The entire case brings home points
valid for all. It should show that men

are ruled either by the dictates of ©

conscience or by the specific rules
established by their society or both,
but never by innocuous non-policies
or vague dictates from the “Twlight
Zone.”

It should also point out that a clear .

delineation of policy, even though
unpopular, is to be much preferred to
a hazy skirting of the issues, that
disagreement and respect are not
necessarily mutually exclusive.

Whatever the consequences, it is
to be hoped that this type of situation
does not recur at Davidson. It does
no credit to anyone involved.

The Faculty Side-step

The thoughts that come to mind
concerning the recent faculty meeting
are on the whole generally unpleas-
ant.

First there is the initial disappoint-
ment that the faculty did not act on
the plan of the RHA that would allow
students to establish open dorms ona
24-hour basis. We find the. proposal
entirely reasonable. The student plan
cites mo:
cal justification in the Code of Respon-
sibility and m the report of the Com-
mission on Coeducation.

THE DAVIDSONIAN supports the
RHA plan and it is our hope that the
faculty can act to approve the plan
before the trustee meeting to be held
April 24. A favorable position stated
publicly by the faculty would.do much
to indicate a positive campus attitude
to the trustees. The sooner such a
stand is taken, the more likely it is
that the trustees will realize the value
of the RHA plan.

A second’ disappointment comes
from a reading of the proposals, main-
ly concerning final examinations,
made by the Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC) and adopted by the
faculty.

It is true that the new rules con-
stitute a substantial liberalizing of
past faculty policy toward exams.
There is now an official sanction of
oral exams, take-home exams, and in-
dependent papers and research as
valid forms of a final ‘evaluation of a
student’s work in a course.

However, there is no recognition
that Such a final evaluation is not
necessary as a hard and fast policy.
Instead it is stated that the depart-
ment chairman must submit to the
Dean of the Faculty a definite state-
ment of the methods of evaluation
to be used in their departments.

It is further stated that ‘‘all faculty
members will turn into the Dean of
the Faculty a copy of their final ex-
amination in all courses.” This ruling
is simply onerous and nefarious.

The issue of self-scheduled exams
was also curiously and unfortunately
omitted from the proposals. Report-
edly the EPC had been told by various
members of the Honor Court that such
a system would put an unacceptable

- B.C.

than ‘adequate philosophi- |

strain on the Davidson honor system.

Not only do we question the valid-
ity of such testimony as being in any
sense representative of real student
situations, but we also seriously ques-
tion the charge itself. We do not be-
lieve Davidson students to be that in-
capable of self-regulation.

It seems that the EPC has just be-
gun its work. The abolishment of the
strict requirement of final examina-
tion and the institution of self-sched-
uled exams are two changes that must
not be ignored. We hope the faculty
does not consider itself sufficiently
reformed in the area of final exams.

Patient

Too Long

Mr. Bond’s Martin Lecture, while
lacking anything of real significance,
was nevertheless quite revealing of
the character of this youthful leader.
“It is quite surprising, then, that
some students expressed concern after
his speech over the bitterness *that
Mr. Bond displayed in the opening
moments of his presentation.

Given the fact that he is a Negro
and-making the safe assumption that
he is thinking seriously about the sit
uation of Blacks in America, we find
it surprising that he contained his
bitterness as well as he did.

Mr. Bond, and indeed every Black
in the United States today, has a per-
fect right to feel bitter, extremely
bitter, over the inane actions of white
Americans over the past two hundred
years.

So why were some students sur-
prised? We do not know. Did they
expect to hear some Uncle Tom spew-
ing back the pap that they have hand-
ed him and his ancesters for two hun-
dred years? We do not know.

As Mr. Bond pointed out, the spee-
ches he quoted were over a Ccen-
tury oldsand yet were frighteningly
contemporary. Blacks have been far
too patient in seeking their rights.
We should realize that and not make
them wait a second longer.

Thorton Labels Bond A
Champion Of Liberalism

To the Editor:

I note from your March
13th issue that Julian Bond
will lecture at Davidson on
March 31st and April Ist.

When a man spends most
of his time on the lecture
circuit, one naturally wond-
ers what he is ‘'‘selling.”’ It
has to be an idea, or ideas.

It shduld be a matter of

record before he speaks that
he keeps funny company.
One tries to figure what is
up when he is working so
assiduously on the universi-
ties and the churches.
Being a Baptist I hate to
admit, that liberals within
the Southern Baptist Chris-
tian Life Commission have

ruthlessly held a ‘‘seminar"’ +

tell you that | finally found a parking

on Sex Education in Atlanta
on March 16-18 at the Ameri-
can Motel.

Three invited speakers
(and by now they have al-
teady spoken so this isn't
rumor) are Anson Mount,
public affairs manager’ of
PLAYBOY magazine, Joseph
Fletcher, the father of the
“new Morality” or “situation
ethics” and Julian Bond.

Of Bond it is written that
he is one of the most con-

‘ troversial civil rights agita-

tors, and perhaps no one in
this country is loved and
cherished by the Left-Lib-
eral crowd more than he.
He has championed the civil
rights anarchists and the
Black Power militants from
the beginning.

Like the other denomina-
tions, the Baptists are be-
ginning to put on their ar-
mor against the onslaught of
the insidious new left that
is infiltrating and trying to
take over the seminaries
and in time the churches.

These three men_ repre-
sent a good example of their
strategy and their tactics.

Bond is a_ paid speaker
and is not due any ‘‘cover
up" as to his speaking ac-
tivities and associates.

Hatfield Against The Draft;

Calls For Volunteer Army -

ED NOTE: The following
speech by Senator Hatfield

was excerpted from the
‘Congressional Recoyd' of
April 3, 1969,

I have’ always been some-
what annoyed by people who
consistently look disaster in
the eye and announce that

“something good will come

of it in the end.’ I Ge neral

ly suspect that such people
either do not comprehend
the calamity
or are callous to tragedy. «

So it is with certain mis-
givings that I assert that
something positive may re-
sult from our involvement
in the senseless and unpop-
ular war in Vietnam.

Without the war |
that opposition

the mature of

doubt
fo our sy-

stem of conscription would |
have gained the momentum _

it has, momentum which
may eventually lead to the
abolition of the draft and the
establishment of a volunteer
military, the only system
that allows the maximum
rersonal liberty and elimin-
ates the major inequities in-
herent in conscription.

I feel strongly that each
man has a moral obligation
to serve his country, but he
must be granted the
dom to accept his responsi-

free-

bility and the right to de
termine the form” his ser
vice shall take. Individual
liberty is not a concession
that can be withdrawn or
that must be paid for by
military serivce. It is the
ultimate right in a de
mocracy,

The draft also fails to
meet the criterion of fair-
ness, for it is not equall¥
applied. There has been a
great deal. of resentment
because the Selective. Ser-
vice System is not adminis-
tered uniformly throughout
the country, because of the
many inequities of the de-
ferment system.

‘But the most basic in-
equity is the fact that a

smaller and smaller minor-'

ity of our young men is car-
rying the* burden of na-
tional defense. Even under
today’s crisis conditions the

that capriciously requisi-

allowing the majority their

An all-volunteer force is
usually first challenged on
the ground that it would
never proivde armed ser-
vicesy with the number of
men needed, The evidence
indicates otherwise.

In peacetime, accord-
ing to the economist Wal-
ter Oi, a volunteer mili
tary, with its reduced turn

only about 333,000 young
men into the enlisted ranks
each year. Statistically, this
comes ‘down to less than 2
por cent of the draft-eligible
pool--young men between
18 and 26. Even if this pool

were limited to men 18
through 20-—the ages at
which the majority of

youths are “thaking career

would need to recruit only

group into the entisted

taxpayers to re-
cognize the true cost of mil-
itary activity. If they would
be unwilling to pay this
cost, it must be because the
benefits from such activity
are less than its cost. In
such a case, the activity
should be curtailed and
not, as under a draft sy-
stem, merely have its cost
concealed. . .

“The volunteer army does
not increase this real cost
of national defense; if any-
thing, because it. is more
efficient, it reduces that
cost. What it does do, how-
ever, is make the cost ap-
parent while distributing it
more evenly.” :

A second common criti-
cism of the proposal for
volunteer military service
is that it would produce an
all-black army, (Sometimes
the charge is that it would
be a poor black army; the
fact that the draft system
produces a poor army is
overlooked.

It is the upper-lower class
that are drafted in dispro-
Portionate numbers, A. vol-
unteer army, because of
improved pay, status and
conditions, would be much
more a middle-class army.)

There is little reason to
believe that black men
would join the military in
great disporportion to the
number of white young men
who would be drawn to this
career. In fact, the national
advisory commission on the
draft stated in’ its report,
“Tn Pursuit of Equity,”’ that
qualified white and black
youths volunteer at rates

about equal to their over-
all proportion in society.
(Blacks between 18 and 26
represent about 12 per cent
of their age group and they
enter the service in ap-
proximately the same pro-
portion.)
Another
against

charge brought
ihe voluntary-mil+
tary proposal is just as fal-
lacious and emotional as
the predictions of a black
army. This is the argument
that a professional military
would be composéd of “‘mer-
cenaries’’—men who would
join the service only for the
money and whose loyalty
would therefore be ques-
tionable.

This line of reasoning
presupposes that young
men would choose military
careers solely because they
were well-paid. But young
people who pick careers as
teachers or carpenters cer-
tainly don't reach their de-
cisions purely on the basis
of economics, and there is
no reason to think that those
who enlist in the military
would be motivated entirely
by good pay and improved
benefits.

John Mitrisn, a former
research associate at the In-
stitute for Policy Studies,
recently pointed out
article in Current
“Monetary gain,
and veterans’ benefits are
not the only reasons men
join the armed forces; if
they were there would be
almost no true volunteers
today. Men join because of
patriotism, family, — tradi-
tion, the military’s image of
manliness and the chance

in an
History:

to travel. These attractions
are strong .. .’’
Frankly, I believe that

the method of recruiting en-
listed men is unrealistic to
the possibility of a rise in
militarism. Draftees who
are only in’ the} service for
two years and Neo are at
the very bottom of“the mili-
tary power structure, have
very little ability to exert
a “civilian” influence on

the military hierachy. The

danger of military elitism
comes primarily from the

officers, who are and
almost. always have been
volunteers or ‘“‘profession-

als.”

We should continue. our
tradition of drawing officers
from widely divergent so-
cial, economic and geo-
graphical backgrounds. We
should also continue our Con-
gressional selection of the

‘student bodies at our mili-

tary academy, maintain

puses and provide for ex-
panded opportunities for en-

The ~
Marburg View

By DICK ANDERSON

UTA MRS OSE NS TIS

Ere The Twain Shall Meet

VIENNA—The dominant impression left by this city
is of the colossal buildings of the old Empire, monu-
ments to one of the great motivating forces in Euro-
pean history. ‘

~ This force is the drive toward German unifica-
tion, which, was for a long time led by the old Austrian
state. Since 1866, however, the German people have
been permanently divided into two states, the one in
the North with its capital at Berlin and the Southern
state with its capital at Vienna.

This trend was partially reversed by the trey.'-up
of the Third Reich since the Second World War.

But now that north German state, sundered for
twenty-five years, is again discussing union, as yet
not on the official level but among the citizens of the
two parts. This discussion has been awakened by the
meeting of West German Bundeskanzler Willi Brandt
and his East German counterpart Willi Stoph at
Erfurt. -

The two are hardly met to discuss anything so
radical as reunification. The subjects of their contin-
uing meetings are a nox-agression pact, legal recogni-
tion of the DDR and regularization of relations be-
tween the two states. ; :

Despite the propaganda of right-wing groups in
West Germany, all of these topics are steps in the
general direction of reunification. It-has become ob-
vious that union will fot be brought about by force of
anyone’s arms, and it is also rather clear that the
DDR would not be interested in union until the West
Germans are willing to treat with it as an equal.

Far.more important at the moment are the at-
titudes of the superpowers and .of the various allies
in the two blocs towards union.

German federalists must face the fact that no-

‘body outside Germany really wants to see the two

halves come together. Especially in Eastern Europe
there is still fear of the Germans coupled with the
memory of more than 30 million casualties in the
Second World War.

Western nations are already hard pressed to keep
up with the powerful West German economy, None
of them desire to see East German industrial poten-
tial added to that of the West, and the same is true
of the Eastern bloc in relation to East Germany.

However, in the course of the next decade all
of these obstacles are likely to lose force. Russian
influence in East Germany is even more dependent
on the Soviet troops there than is Western influence
on the NATO troops in the Western half.

But the Russians are going fo be needing most of
those troops in Asia to defend their long border with

_China. Moreover, the East Germans dislike being

occupied, even by “allies,’’ as much as any other
country, and as the fear of the attack from the West
recedes they will pressure the Soviets to withdraw ’
their troops. : ey

East Germany’s own “economic miracle,” based
on the same qualities which made for West Germany’s
suécess, has already made them the Eastern bloc’s
second economic power. Indeed, in many fields \the
USSR is becoming merely a supplier of*raw materials
to more efficient East German factories; dependency
of the Warsaw Pact countries on East German indus-
try will increase with the accelerating growthof the
East German economy, which may rise as high: as
fifth in the world during the next 30 years, accord-
ing,.to projections made by Herman Kahn.

Partly from this economic dominance and partly
due to other factors, there has been an increasing
tendency for East Germany to assume the mantle
of political leadership in the East. The Russian desire
to avoid further widening of the breach between
themselves and some of the more nationalistic East-
ern European countries has led them to look for a
conservative to represent them in Eastern councils:
the obvious choice has been East Germany's Walter
Ulbricht. :

Ulbricht still fears West Germany, in my opinion
largely because of East Germany’s inferior position.
His part of the nation is far smaller, has had less
success economically and. has achieved much less in-
ternational. recognition as an independent actor in
world affairs. The combination of the new ‘Wirt-
schaftswunder” and increasing independence of the
Soviets will change this inferiority.

These factors are unlikely to change Ulbricht’s
psychological approach .to West Germany, for he is
an old man and inflexible. But old men die, and the
leaders who eventually succeed him may feel more
secure in their relations with West Germany, assum-
ing that much antipathy of the present leadership
toward the West is in fact based on such feelings.
This process will be helped along by decreasing West
German bellicosity toward the East.

In short, at some time in the reasonably near
future the stage will be set for German reunification
to depend almost exclusively on the wishes of the
German governments. The question will then be one
of desire, opportunity and method,

Still it is not at all clear that desires of the popu-
lace have ‘significant effects on the policies of the
East German rulers. And the stumbling block of Com-
munist capitalist rivalry stands in the way.

There is no-reason why the Eastern leaders should
have to make immediate changes in their system to
unite with the West, nor vice versa. A plausible method
would be to adopt a-confederal approach, with a
national capital in Berlin, regional. capitals in Bonn
and Pankow and each side continuing under the sys-
tem it presently has» ~~~" ~~ * i a

Confederations are inefficient; pressure for a
tighter union could arise purely from that circum-
stance. Once the first step of confederation is taken
further steps become easier.

Is this column only pure speculation? Maybe,
perhaps even probably. There are lots of objections
to such a theory. One of them is West Germany’s re-
lationship to the Common Market. Were the Six to be-
come a closer union, then the whole question of Ger-
man unification Would be swallowed up in that of
all Europe.

Almost any sort of sudden cooling in East-West
relations could severely hinder this program, perhaps
even destroy its chances. Evolution of the nation
state system could make the entire question meaning-
less. If the Chinese either are quickly defeated or for
other reasons led up on the Russians, there would
be less reason for the latter to relax their hold on
Rast Germany. Nonetheless, the scenario outlined
in this column is a possible path towards solution
of the problem of, the German division.
