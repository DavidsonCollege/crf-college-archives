Drugs: key to spiritual enlightenment

COMING SOON TO JOHNSTON GYM...
THE LIVE SHOW YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR

TERMINATOR XXX
"Hightower
Goes Nudie"

“Brahman is Atman; Atman
is Brahman” I uttered contempla-
tively as I passed the bong pipe to
Bill “Dr. Toke” Mahony.
“Grooooovy” he replied as two
curls of smoke streamed gently out
of his nostrils.

For years I have wrestled with

the subject of ultimate reality, but,

not until my four years at Davidson
have I loosened up enough to ex-
perience the true harmony of the
universe one experiences through
“altered states of consciousness.”
Ganja, Weed, Mary Joe, Reefer,
Pot. My experience with this five
leafed wonder has opened me to
new levels of spiritual awareness.
“The Buddhais a pile of shit sticks”
“What is the sound of one hand
clapping?” “What did my face
look like before my parents were
born?” “Why can’t Nathan Seay
and Rob KIng ever get a date?” All
of these koans suddenly became
perfectly clear to me for the first
time when I smoked ganja with my
study group the night before Dr.
Mahony’s final exam.

The use of drugs as a way of
reaching spiritual enlightenment
in Eastern religious traditions such
as Hinduism, Buddhism or Tao-
ism is obvious, but what about
Western religious traditions such
as Judaism or Christianity?

Speaking recently to fellow
religion major Amy Cohan I

learned about the “secret” ingredi- -

ent in passover matza which gives
Jewish people around the world
reason to celebrate. You guessed
it, hasheesh.

Chair of the Religion depart-
ment, Dr. Karl Plank added, “The
epistemological, hermeneutical,
ontological, teleological, peda-
gogical instances of chemically
induced altered states of conscious-
ness within the narrative tradition
of the Jewish people is unprec-
edented given the historical, cul-
tural, and socioeconomic context
in which the texts were written.”
Having heard this, I immediately
took another puff of my joint,
looked at him, warmly smiled and
said, “Heh, heh, yeah, cool, heh,
heh!”

I have also spoken recently to
co-leader of F.C.A., Bo
Bartholemew who informed me
that the letters of F.C.A. really
represent Fellowship of Cocaine
Addicts. Bo went on to say that
“We are currently implementing a
rigorous program of evangelical
outreach whereby every student
shall receive a free gram of F.C.A.
processed cocaine wrapped in a
Bible verse in their Good Stuff
boxes at the beginning of each
school year.” He closed by saying,
“We hope to have two hundred
new lives snorting their way. to
accepting the Lord by next fall!”

The next person I interviewed
was Giorgio “the Godfather” Hiatt,
current leader of Intravenous Chris-
tian Fellowship, who stressed
I.V.C.F.’s unique committment to
the use of heroin in its praise groups.
Hiatt states that “So many times
the intellectual farting characteris-
tic of Davidson students inhibits

the working of the Holy Spirit in
their lives. You should just see
those freshmen loosen up the sec-
ond the needles slide into their
veins.”

The last person I spoke to in
my drug-induced quest for spiri-
tual enlightenment was our col-
lege chaplain and resident expert
on the subject, Dr. Rob “the phar-
macist’” Spach. I first experienced
the constructive use of hallucino-
genic drugs when I attended my
first En Route meeting. “’Shrooms
are our drug of choice here at En
Route. We have recently collabo-
rated with the Biology department,
so we are able to grow our own in
the green house behind the senior
apartments.”. Of course, during
Holy seasons of the liturgical year
such as Lent or Advent, the
chaplain’s office picks up the tab
for L.S.D cartoon stickers to be
distributed through the Ecumeni-
cal Council to the various Chris-
tian groups on campus. Spach
concludes by saying, “It is won-
derful to see students take their
first “trip” and realize that walls
really do breathe or simply that we
have thousands of roaches craw]-
ing underneath our skin.”

I hope that I have offered a
unique and reinvigorating way of
helping you and your friends reach
eventual spiritual enlightenment.
As for me, it’s off to Duke Divinity
School. I hear the weed up their is
pretty good.

Shalom!
