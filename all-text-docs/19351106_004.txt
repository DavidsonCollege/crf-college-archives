BEAT DUKE!

By HARRY KUYKENDALL

The first team has had_ its
chance Saturday and it has lived up
to its fighting reputation, For even
tho’ it fought against odds, even
tho’ it appeared to be defeated
from the start—until the last min-
ute, those eleven men fought so
hard that last minute that
defeated Ohio State University—

reputed the strongest team in the

they

country.

Homecoming? Altogether?
FOR a great many folk—among them alumni, faculty,
friends—it won't be an altogether thorough homecoming

unless it includes a visit to Hotel Charlotte.

A meal in The Tavern, maybe; or a dance at dinner-time
in the Main Dining Room; or perhaps just a visit with a
friend in the Lobby—but the point is that it’s a sort of

incomplete “homecoming” unless Hotel  Charlotte’s some-

where in the picture.

We'd like Hotel Charlotte to be deemed important to
them by Davidsonians and their friends—for Davidsonians

and their friends are important to us!

Although Duke will be looking ahead#
to the important North Carolina game,
they will not neglect Davidson, A scrappy
prospect is indicated by the fact that
both teams were victorious over South
Carolina and Davidson held North Caro-
