BRST anaes THE DAVIDSONIAN

On the diamond in 2000 F

Wildcats count on depth to lead them back to playoffs

By SEAN BurRKE

Staff Writer

Coming offa subpar season that featured
only 11 wins in 49 games, the Davidson
baeball team looks to avenge old demons and
reappear in the Southern Conference tourna-
ment.

Pitching and defense should be the keys
this season, according to head coach Dick
Cooke, who enters his tenth season at David-
son. ;

With three of Davidson’s top four pitch-
ers returning, this staff should be in good
shape.

The men on the hill are led by Wes Self,
who won six games last year. Self shocked
Duke last year by limiting them to three runs
in six innings (two earned) in a game where
Davidson competed well, just falling short 6-
5 :

The pitchers complementing the staff

are Ryan Stroker, Jamie McDonald, and the
versatile Jeremiah Parvin, who inthree years
has seen action in the outfield, the infield, and
the pitcher’s mound.

The Davidson defense, likewise, has solid
returning players at every infield position,

“ including shortstop Ben Brown. Brown fin-

ished last year as the leader in batting average
(.344), hits (67), triples (4), and on-base per-
centage (.414).

Joining Brown around the bases are third
basemen Trae Fletcher and senior first
baseman power hitter Stu Sloan. Matt Torres
and Cassidy Lundin will share time at second
base. |

With depth and experience at every po-
sition and a chilly spring that will encourage
a constant player rotation to prevent early
arm injury, it will be interesting to see who
steps up this year for the baseball team.

“Few positions are set in stone,” said
Cooke.

The team’s depth can help it find that
special chemistry that will get this team back
into the conference playoffs.

The season started earlier tonight as
Davidson hosted High Point. A weekend
homestand follows against Mount Saint
Mary’s Feb. 11 and 12.

No WWE here, just class, de-
termination, and a headlock

Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock.

Ian Kaplan, They are all wrestlers, all tough
guys, but only one of them lives among us.

I spoke with Ian Kaplan yesterday and
was impressed by class act this guy is.
Whereas Stone Cold can’t be trusted, and is
just as likely to whack you with a chair as
shake your hand, Ian proved to me that real

wrestlers are respectful and dedicated ath- .

letes.

Ian, a senior ‘The Kaplan File

there is no arrogance there—only drive and
determination.

And don’t forget the national tourna-
ment, which rolls into St. Louis this year.
After two straight years of being a wild card
seed, [an says it is “not going to happen this
year.” Ian plans on going in there locked and
loaded folks.

[an and the other wrestlers currently prac-
tice around 15 hours a week and they watch a
lot of tape, which is a concern for Ian. Ian’s
favorite move is his deadly Front Headlock
and he thinks he’s going to have to change his
usage of it because he might be too predict-

arco . able. But didn’t

biology major .
from New York,
has a 22-7 career
record at David-
son. He wrestles
in the 157-pound
weight class. Ian’s
wrestling career
dates back to his
high school days,
when he finished second in the state in his
senior year.

That is mighty impressive—New York
is a big ol’ state.

Kaplan is coming off a big conference
win against UNC Greensboro and is looking
forward to some non-conference opponents
in the coming weeks. But he already has his
sights set on the conference championship,
scheduled for Feb. 28 in Chattanooga, Tenn.

“T fully plan on being the first seed in the
conference,” said Kaplan, who was seed third
in the tournament last year.

That might sound a little Deion Sanders-
ish, but when you look into this man’s eyes,

the Titans know
that Kurt
Warner was go-
ing to pass the
football and still
lost?
Seriously though,
Ian’s dedication to
wrestling is supe-
rior to anyone I’ve
ever seen. Honestly, I have never seen any-
one so determined to do well. Ian doesn’t
have any rituals he does before a match; he
just goes out, lays the smack down and gets
back off the mat.

And speaking of laying the smack down,
Jan’s really looking forward to wrestling a
particular Citadel Bulldog. Now, I'll tell you
what, I feel sorry for The Citadel folks on a
regular basis, but I feel EXTRA sorry for that
poor guy. I know that I'd hate to see Ian
across the mat planning to employ the Front
Headlock on me...and I even know how to do
the Stone Cold Stunner.

fine,
