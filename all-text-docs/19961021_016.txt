THE DAVIDSONIAN BACK PAGE INTERVIEW OCTOBER 21, 1996

Before speaking
at the US/China conference,
Richard Nixon’s chief interpreter

during his historic 1972 trip to China

offers views on Hong Kong’s
return to China, the Taiwan ©
Strait, and China’s changing
place as a new world power.

How would you characterize
Sino-American relations at the
moment?

Economic and cultural re-
lations are flourishing. Politi-
cal relations are troubled how-
ever. China and the United
States may be about to enter a
new phase. The principal issue
for contention is the Taiwan
Strait issue. Since both sides of
the Taiwan Strait no longer be-
lieve in the possibility of a
peaceful settlement, Beijing and
Taipei have essentially adopted
policies that are antagonistic and
could threaten to draw the U.S.
into 'the conflict, which Ameri-
cans don’t want to be involved
in.

Can you clarify the Taiwan
Strait dispute between Beijing
and Taipei?

Peace in the Taiwan Strait
has depended on the view by
both sides that there are only
two possible futures for Tai-
wan. One is the status quo and
the other is reunification. Poli-
tics in Taiwan are now centered
around the third option of inde-
pendence. Because that is the

. direction of politics in Taiwan
to change the status quo, Beijing
cannotrelax. Now that Taiwan

‘is trying to gain a separate iden-
tity internationally, Beijing feels
it has to treat the Taiwan ques-
tion as an urgent one. Beijing
thus feels the need to take strong
actions. I think Taiwan’s secu-
rity and prosperity requires
some form of working relation-
ship with Beijing. As an Ameri-
can, I don’t care what that rela-
tionship is and I hope they can
work out some form of under-
standing.

Is China a threat to its neigh-
bors with its growing military
capabilities? ‘

China’s military strength
certainly will continue to grow.
China will become a very pow-
erful country in the next cen-

_tury. This means the strategic
balance and correlation of forces
in the region is changing. That

means that every country in the
region needs to make adjust-

ments as Chinese power grows.

This does not mean China is
expansionist or militaristic.
Here’s the problem with China:
China is the only great power to
see its territory dismembered
by other great powers. It is the
only great power that does not
have secured and recognized
frontiers. Specifically from the
Sino-Indian border to the Ko-
rean seabed, virtually all
China’s border are unsettled.
That means in the South China
Sea, China disputes seabed re-
sources with Indonesia and con-
trol over reefs and small islands
with numerous Southeast Asian
countries. And there’s the un-
settled issue over Diaoyutai/
Senkaku islands with Japan
along with seabed dispute with
Korea. This
means that
from China’s
perspective,
China must
defend its
boundaries as
it sees them.
But from thew
perspective off
others, that
might be seen
as offensive and
threatening. China’s actions are
essentially defensive but are
seen by others as offensive. The
Taiwan question is a special
case because it is a dispute in-
side the Chinese family.

How will Hong Kong change
after being returned to China
in 1997?

All sides will try to pre-
serve the existing social and
economic status. Politically
there will be two changes. The
democratization of Hong Kong
by Britain violated the agree-
ment between Britain and
China. Thus the first change
will be to change whatever Brit-

ain has changed in Hong Kong -

politically. The second is this:
Beijing -will try hard to keep
Hong Kong the same as before
but the widespread of corrup-
tion in southern China will prob-

Chas Freeman is the
Chairman of the Board of
Projects International. He
spent 1989 through 1992 as
the Ambassador to Saudi
Arabia, but has dedicated
most of his career to China.

He has served as Deputy Director
of the Republic of China Desk in
1975-76, on the China Normaliza-
tion Working Group in the 1970s,

as Deputy Chief of Mission in’

Beijing from 1981 through 1984,
and as Assistant Secretary of De-

fense for International Secu-
rity Affairs from 1994-94.
Freeman gave theclos- —
ing address of the confernce
on Sino-American relations,
focusing on “Managing
U.S.-China Relations:”

ably flow over into Hong Kong
after a few years.

What are some ways by which
we can help dispose the mis-
conceptions and misunder-
standings between the U. S.
and China?

The short answer to that
would be to engage in dialogue
constructively and to restore
communication. National Se-
curity Advisor Lake’s recent
visit to China symbolized a
change in policy of hostility and
isolation for the past seven
years. It also began a dialogue
on how to bring China into in-
ternational organization and to
bring China into the consul of
the international society in a
way that would serve the inter-
est of the United States and the
international society. I think
the Americans have an over-

simplified and unrealistic view —

of China. China is a lot more
intricate and complex than what
the images
of the
Tiananmen
massacre
imply.
China also
has numer-
ous prob-
lems and dif-
ficulties,
which, when
you under-
stand them,
enables you to be a lot more
forgiving when you look at Chi-
nese government policies. I’m
not saying Chinese society has
alot of respect forhuman rights,
or is politically very open, but I
am saying it is evolving in the
right direction, and is a lot more
open that it was in 1989.

What would you like to
say to Davidson students?

US-Chinese relations dated
back to 1843 when President
Tyler first wrote to the Chinese
Emperor. 1843 is an important
date since China lost the title of
largest economic power in the
world to Britain around 1850.
That was also when China
started to fall for the next 150

years. In the same period, the
U.S. grew from tiny colonies to
the world’s strongest country
economically and militarily.
China will become strong and
take its rightful place in the
world in our lifetime. Just as
we have experienced difficul-
ties in adjusting to the rise of the
U. S. and the fall of China, we
are also having difficulties ad-
justing to the rise of China. If
you look at the next 35 to 40
years, that period will be domi-
nated by opportunities and prob-
lems from China. By the year
2000, over 50 percent of the
world’s economic growth will
come from Asia and the bulk of
that growth is from China. No -
student at Davidson or any
American can afford to ignore
the enormous shift in wealth
and power that is going on, and
which is revising Chinese stat-
ure in the world to something
approaching what is was his-
torically before China under-
went the last 150 years of diffi-
culty and collapse. The subject
of China in all dimensions is
something we should pay at-
tention to because the lives of
Davidson students will be af-
fected by how China rises and
how it uses its power.
