Unique lecture
progam planned

Visiting scholars will present
a series of eleven lectures here
March 16-April 6 on topics
ranging from ‘‘Philosophical
Problems of Genetic Engineer-
ing”’ to ‘‘The Politics of Ilusion
and the Illusion of Politics:
Dangers to Democracy.”

The philosophy lecture series —
is unique. “I don’t think any
college in the United States has
that many lectures in that much
time,’’ Philosophy Department
Chairman Earl MacCormac
said.

Co-sponsored by the Philo-
sophy department and the Cen-
ter for Special Studies, the lec-
ture series is funded in part by
the Franklin J. Machette Fou-
dation.

Speakers will include profes-
sors from universities across the
country and government offi-
cials such as U.S. District
James B. McMillan and former
Mecklenburg County Commis-
sion Chairman Liz Hair. The

- lectures adress political, bio-

ethical, and religious issues.

The series will end Monday,
April 6 with a film, Reflections,
by English mathematician Keth
Crichlow.

This is a tremendous oppor-
tunity to hear some great
contemporary thinkers. Check
the calendar for details.
