Frolics Weekend

By ANNE PELFREY
Asst. Features Editor

The Kinks will headline
Spring Frolics Weekend, April
25 and 26 according to Union
Board .President Richard
Wassen.

The movie ‘Lady Sings the
Blues’’ will be shown on Friday
night, April 25..A group will
also be performing in the
Rathskellar that evening.

“A beer party with games
will be featured outside on one
of the fields. There will
probably be a band to play
during these games on Satur-
day afternoon’”’, Wassen said.

“The Kinks, a British group,
will perform in _ Love
Auditorium Saturday night.
We’ll. also have a dance
following the concert,’’ he said.

An outside movie may be
shown on the back of Phi Hall,
according to Wassen.

‘‘We’d put sheets on the
building to make a screen and
show some movie like ‘Frank-
enstein and the Worm’,’” he
said.

The Union has an agreement
that the court does their heavy
partying on Friday night, while
the Union plans big for Satur-
day night. This way we get a lot
of participation,’’ Wassen said.

theme connecting the ac-
tivities.

“The term ‘central theme’ is
a misnomer. It’s best to
describe: the weekend as
unified. There’ll be a lot to do
and choices to make. For
example, if someone doesn’t
want to see a movie, they can
go to the Rathskellar,’’ he said.

This is the first major
weekend planned by the Union
Board under Wassen.

‘‘Midwinters had most of the
administrative details worked
out by the Union Board before
us. We learned how to carry
plans out that weekend,”’
Wassen said.

‘Putting on a concert is pret-
ty complicated-and you need
organization involving man-
power and detailed work,’’ he
said.

‘You have to unload for the
group, set up, entertain them,
and sell tickets.”

Spring Frolics will be ‘held

during a weekend when several
professional tests will be given.

‘“‘We had almost no choice in
planning the date for Spring
Frolics. All the other weekends
were taken. Alumni weekend
comes right before this,’”’ said
Wassen.

“I think those tests will in-
volve only 20 people and I
apologize to them,’’ he added.

A thriving village of more
than a thousand inhabitants,
called Davidson, has grown up

north, south, east, or west. It
has also local and long distance
telephones, express and
telegraph facilities, etc.

SAFEGUARDS

The location insures health,
being on the line of the highest
ground between the Yadkin and
the Catawba, nine hundred feet
above Sea level.

It is sufficiently remote from
larger cities or towns to escape
their temptations and ex-
citements. Few places are so
free from temptations to vice

_and extravagance.

SOCIAL ADVANTAGE

Few villages of the same size
furnish equal’ social ad-
vantages. The Faculty and the
villagers alike do all in their
power to give the students a
home-life.

CHARACTER OF
STUDENT BODY

THE

It is not too much to say that
the student body at Davidson is
unique among institutions of
learning: It is the enthusiastic
testimony of practically all
students coming to Davidson
from other institutions that the
moral atmosphere is strikingly
different from anything they
had known before. :

The habits and traditions of
the college are all in favor of
purity, sobriety, and gen-
tlemanly conduct..The students
are a picked body of men,
representing the finest home
training of the South.

Probably-two-thirds of them |

are the sons of church officials,
representing every State in the
South. On the ‘average, more
than nineteen out of every twen-
tv. are themselves professing

Christians, and one in every five
has chosen the ministry of the
Gospel as his life’s work.

It is not too much to'say, then,
that the Davidson student body
fairly represents the flower of.
Southern culture and home
training. To spend the four for-
mative years of college life
among such associates, to
select one’s lifelong circle of
college friends from such com-
panions, is an inestimable
privilege.

Those can best.appreciate it
who know from long college ex-
perience the _ irresistible
molding force of campus sen-
timent and tradition on the im-
mature, plastic, hero-
worshiping boy, exposed for the
first time to its contagious
fascination.

Let it be distinctly understood
that no claim is made that there
are no ad boys at Davidson. The

horities sorrowfully admit

‘that it seems impossible to

gather together five hundred
young men, all of whom should
be pure-minded, upright, and
honorable.

Even at Davidson, a yung
man, if he will, can find un-
desirable associates. Yet this
class is small, uninfluential,
and opposed by campus habits
and ideals. Its members are
rigorously eliminated by the
Faculty as soon as their true
character is discovered. ;

STUDENT
SELF-GOVERNMENT _

The honor. system began at
Davidson early in its history .
The students themselves are its
sternest guardians - and
executors. It is in these latter
times enforced through the
Student Council.
