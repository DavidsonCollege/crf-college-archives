Grange Funds Chemistry Renovations

By EARL W. LAWRIMORE
News Bureau Director

The Grange Foundation
awarded a $1.1 million grant to
Davidson College Wednesday to
renovate the Martin Chemistry
Building, according to Vice
President for Development
Craven Williams.

The. Grange Foundation
makes grants to ‘‘colleges
which make significant con-
tributions to scientific
education through innovative
teaching methods and faculty-
student research.”

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. accepted the award
on behalf of the college. ‘‘We
are very appreciative of the
work the Grange Foundation is
doing to promote higher
education in small private
liberal arts colleges and par-
ticularly for this generous con-
tribution to Davidson,’ said
Spencer.

“We have always had a
strong commitment toward the
sciences and have campaigned
hard to get this grant,’’ Spencer
said. “I only wish it could have
been more.”’

Williams stressed the com-
mitment the college has to the
Grange Foundation in ac-
cepting the grant. ‘“‘We must
remember that this money
must be matched by Davjdson
on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and
we will rename the building, of
course, for Dr. Donald
Grange.”’

Chemistry Department
,Chairman Nicholas Burnett ex-
pressed surprise and pleasure
at this announcement.

“T and the entire chemistry
department, which will occupy
the renovated project, are just
tickled pink. We're finally going
to have a structure Davidson
College can be proud of, and we.
can stop these piecemeal fix-it
jobs like worn’ wiring
replacement,” said Burnett.

Former Davidson Chemistry
Professor and 9th District
Congressman James G, Martin
will head up the campaign for
the matching funds.

“This will be a tough assign-
ment, but I’m confident in my
ability to sell anyone a bill of
goods,”’ said Martin. ‘‘I’ll be
working in Washington D.C. to
get D.C. funds,’’ he added.
“We're going to make the new
James Martin & Donald Grange
Memorial Chemistry facility
the finest building of its kind,”’
Martin pledged.

“Now that the administration
has made a commitment to
chemistry, we'll
tomorrow for the design of the
building,” said Burnett.

“Grover Meetze and I will
take the bus to Mary Baldwin
tomorrow to get ideas from
their chemistry facility,’ he ad-
ded.

“But tonight will be a night
for celebration. I’m going to
break open the ethyl alcohol
I’ve had improperly stored in

the building for the occasion,”
said Burnett.

“This is just too good to
believe. I can’t believe Dr.
Spencer finally got around to
raising money for us. When Dr.
Spencer told me about, the
grant, I almost dropped my
jaw. I’ve been turning in plans
for. .years, only to be
discouraged,”’ Burnett said.

“I can hardly wait for the
Nicholas’ Burnett-James Mar-
tin-Donald Grange building to
be completed,’’ he added.

Spencer emphasized that the

grant represented five years of
fund raising work.

“It’s been obvious to me for
some time now that something
had to be done. It’s been a long,
agonizing wait for the Grange
people to discover the problem
too and drop the money on our
doorstep,’’ said Spencer.

“I think this is a real in-
dication of the generosity of the
Grange Foundation. They gave
us the money without even
being asked,”’ Spencer said.

Faculty Considers Night Exam Proposal
Following Examination Of EPC Policy

By MICHAEL TANNER

The faculty passed a proposal
for implementation of night.

exams in the self-scheduled
exam period by a vote of 54 to 42
Tuesday.

The plan was passed as a trial
measure. The option of night
exams will be open for students
for the upcoming winter term

examinations, and the system.

will then be re-evaluated.

“The vote was a_ bit: sur-
prising to me,’’ said Vice
President for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan.

' Although the night exam
»plan is. a very reasonable
proposal, I believe the exam
periods ously scheduled
were sufficient, time for those
students who planned to take
two exams in one day.”’

" $GA Senator Martin Eakes
introduced the proposal at the
faculty meeting.

“T simply told them that the
number eight was not magic,
and. that seerned to do the
trick,’’ said Eakes.

EPC Members Richard R.
Bernard and Alexander J.
McKelway led the faculty mem-
bers voting in favor of the
proposal. |

Responding to LEakes’
remarks, Bernard said, ‘The
number eight, while not magic,
-is still a very interesting integer
and should not be discriminated
against. ~

“Yes, yes, yes indeedy. We
ran the. night exams proposal

through the-faculty. All we had
to do was plug it in and turn the
crank,’’ Bernard said.

Asked to comment on the
proposal, McKelway
ejaculated, “I shall take a
moment from my _ busy
schedule, (though it be only a
moment, it is far more valuable

than the hours of other men), to
express myself on the issue of
night exams.

“I don’t think you students
realize the degree of anguish we
professors face in waiting in our
offices from 7 to 10 p.m. to give
students answers to exam
questions,” said McKelway.

counts of violating federal
safety and health regulations,
including faulty wiring,
inadequate ventilation hoods,
and improper’ chemical
storage.

“T guess 55 wrongs don’t
make a right,”’ Spencer said. “I
think it’s a real tribute to our
news bureau that they have
kept the authorities from -lear-
ning about these conditions.
Buck has never blown a cover
for us yet,’’ Spencer added.

“T just draw the line, and the
Buck stops here.”

“To be frank, I’ve abhorred
looking at that building,’ said
Spencer. ‘‘In addition to being
the eyesore of the Davidson
campus, the fumes are
horrible,”’ he said. Bs

“After the remodelling, I’ll be
able to. see the library and the
new Samuel R. Spencer Jr.-

Building from my office win-
dow. It will be just like being

cack at Mary Baldwin,” he

said.

Fifteen Davidson freshmen
were selected as North Carolina
Fellows during the final selec-
tion procedures last weekend,
according to Program Director
John D. Kelton.

The North Carolina Fellows
Program attempts to identify
students with leadership poten-
tial and give them money for
summer internships to develop
a following.

‘“‘These 15 finalists had better

- be good,” said Kelton. ‘‘We only

had 15 places, so we passed|up a
lot of good people, some real
natural leaders,” said Kelton.

~ “Of course, the program
caters to students’ who have
potential for leadership, not the
ones who are already leaders,”’
said Kelton.

“‘We may have to change our

name before long,’’ Kelton ad-

“Six of the fellows are
pial this year. I feel kind of
dumb talking about women
fellows. The other nine are just
regular guys,’’ he said.

One of the big attractions to
the program is the possibility
for summer internships,’’ said
Kelton. ‘‘We’ve had past fellows
doing a lot of exciting things.
Several were working in gover-

nment internships in
Washington D.C. and got in-
volved in Watergate.

‘There is a certain amount of
prestige that goes along with

.being a fellow,” said Kelton. “A

lot of students resent the elitist
image of the programs, so we
try to pick a few duds each year
to counterbalance that.’’

Kelton announced that the
following freshmen were selec-
ted as North Carolina Fellows:
