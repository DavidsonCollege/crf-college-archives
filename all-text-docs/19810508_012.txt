Ex-political prisoner, editor

to speak on freedom Friday

Dr. Sandor Kiss, a foreign
service officer at The Voice of
America, will give a speech
entitled ‘‘Communism and Fas-
cism Then and Now: The Story
of the Hungarian Revolution
and Other Attempts at Free-
dom”’ this Friday at 10 am in
the Morrison Room.

As a legislator, activist, and
political prisoner, Dr. Kiss has
faced many threatening situ-
ations for his beliefs. He was
imprisoned and sentenced to
death by the Nazis during
World War II for his activities
as president of the Hungarian
student resistance movement.
Elected to Parliament following
the war, he was again im-

prisoned —this time for three
years—following the commun-
ist coup d’etat.

Dr. Kiss rose again to leader-
ship during the Hungarian Rev-
olution of 1956. The revolution
was crushed, and he and his
family were forced to flee their
country.

After serving as a key wit-
ness in United Nations and
U.S. Senate hearings about the
revolution, Dr. Kiss settled in
this country. Since then he has
served as an editor of East
Europe magazine. and now
broadcasts from Washington,
D.C. to Hungary with the Voice
of America radio.
