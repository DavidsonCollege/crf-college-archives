Tournament in Asheville

‘left the court tonight, I thought we
played our hearts out.”

The Wildcats, picked ninth by
the conference’s coaches before
the season, finished fifth witha 10-
8 league mark, and ended the year
with a 14-14 record, their best in
five years. Musch (15 ppg),
Zimmerman (13 ppg) and Narat
(13 ppg) finished 11th, 12th and
13th, respectively, in the balloting
for all-conference, thus failing to
make either the first or second All-
SC teams. Alpert was named to the
freshthan all-conference team.

In the quarterfinals Friday
night, Naratand Muscheach scored
19 points and Davidson overcame
truly horrendous foul shooting to

win 67-65 over fourth-seeded :

Marshall. Itwas the Wildcats’ third
win of the season over the Thun-

dering Herd.

The ‘Cats trailed 35-24 athalf-
time, but wiped out the deficit in
the first seven minutes of the sec-
ond half with a 20-4 run. Narat’s
three-pointer at 14:49 gave
Davidson a 40-39 lead and Ander-
son hit a baseline jumper to make
it 44-39 with 13:10 left.

The Wildcats led’ 66-59 with
3:10 to go, and needed only to
make their free throws to put the
game away. But Musch,
Zimmerman and Alpert combined
to shoot one for six at the line in the
final three minutes. Davidson was
8 of 21 (38%) for the game.

The Herd had possession with
a chance to win with :05 left, but
Frank Martin, who had hit six of 10
three-pointers and scored 23 points,

just missed a 30-footer at the

buzzer.

the season. Junior Chris Carrigan
pitched what coach Dick Cooke
described as “textbook pitching.”
The southpaw pitched a complete
game shutout while having to throw
only 76 pitches. This performance

season. He is the leading hitter for
the team, which now has 6 batters
with a .350 batting average or bet-
ter.

The following day the Cats
suffered their second one run loss
of the season to UNC-Wilmington,
8-7. After several lead changes the
Cats found themselves down by
one run in the bottom of the ninth
inning.

Davidson showed no signs of
letting this game end up a loss,
finding themselves with bases
loaded and only one out. Unfortu-
nately, the pitching staff for UNC-
W tightened up, striking out the
next two Davidson batters to end
the game.

The Cats offense was led by

- Paul Brannan (3 for 5) along with

Borretti and Clay Hall, who each
chipped in home runs.
