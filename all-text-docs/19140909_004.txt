ATHLETIC PROSPECTS UN-

USUALLY BRIGHT.

(Concluded from page 1)
the old-time Davidson ‘Pep’ reviving
and bursting forth again. Every man
on the Hill seems to have it. Every one
seems to be a booster. Let it continue
to be revived until it shall equal and
even surpass that old fighting spirit of
the days of 1903-1907. “The prospects
jor foot ball this fall are bright. The
base ball prospects look promising. Bas-
ket ball, track and tennis prospects look
pood. Let every ‘student do his part by
huving at once an Athletic Season T icket,
at only $5. oo. Let every Davidson man
be optimistic, revive the “Pep” and work
to make this the greatest year in Ath-
letics that Davidson has ever had.

ALUMNI ATHLETIC ASSOCIA-
TION FORMED.

‘The dream and hope of many a loyal
Davidsonian has at last been realized,
hecause the college now has a real active.
earnest, enthusiastic Alumni Athletic] f
Association. It has gone to work with
a determination and zeal to once more
place Davidson high in athletic circles
of the Sduth, where it once was, and
where it belongs, and where it will be
again shortly. ‘The chief aim of the As-
suciation since its formation has been to
sccure Competent coaches and assistants.
The committee in charge has surpassed
even its own aspiration in what has been
thus far accomplished.

The new association budded into ex-
istence during Commencement, at the
general Alumni meeting. After various
plans were suggested, it was decided to
elect a president, vice-president, secretary
and treasurer, and two others, these five
to compose a committee which should act
for the Alumni in all matters pertaining
to athletics during the coming year.
This committee is composed of the fol-
lowing loyal, enthusiastic alumni: F. L.
Blythe, of Concord; Dr. Luke Beall, of
Greensboro; H. W. McKay, of Char-

lotte: Charlie ‘Taylor, of | Winston-
Salem; C. B. Bailey, of Greenwood,

S.
Since commencement they have held
at least a half dozen meetings. and
finally succeeded in securing R. A. Fet-
zer as Athletic Director and head foot
ball coach, Nelson Harrts as assistant,
and have gotten many alumni foot ball
stars to come back to assist at intervals.
They have mailed out several thousand
letters to alume Hi, and are now raising
money to keep Up their good work.

FRESH-SOPH BASE BALL GAME.

In a game abounding in freak plays,
long hits and costly errors, the annual
Fresh-Soph baseball game was pulled off
Monday morning on the Sprunt Field at
10 o'clock, resulting in a victory of 12
to 2 for the Sophs. This exhibition
proved to be the first athletic contest of
the year, and several new pieces of prom-
ising material showed up to stop kinks in
the last season's Varsity, with a little
coaching.

Walker, Stough and Christenbury
starred for Sophs; Black and Pharr for
Fresh.

LITERARY SOCIETIES TO BE.
GIN WORK SATURDAY.

‘The Eumenean and Philanthropic So-
cieties will begin the year’s work with
the initiation of new men Saturday night.
Although many of the best men in both
societies have left college. there are fine
possibilities in the present members and
the new men to be initiated.

It is a matter of common remark that
the work of the societies has been im-
proving during the past two years, but it
must be confessed that it is far short of
what could well be expected of college
literary societies. By beginning the year
with a full realization of its possibili-
ties, and the proper earnestness and
“pep,” much will be accomplished
towards bringing the work up to the
highest standard.

Prof. F. L. Blythe attended his
twelfth consecutive Fresh reception last

Monday night.

fessors, but to the old men as well. “The
nicknames of the professors were clever-
ly brought out in various ways.

This concluded the program as laid
down, but no such meeting as this would
have been complete without a few words
from Coach Fetzer. He spoke of the
advantage of athletic training and of the
development which foot ball gives a
man, and said that while it took a man
to play the game, at the same time it
took a gentleman. He strongly urged
every one who possibly could to come
out, especially the freshmen, who he said
must surely win out in the end if they
would only keep going out and stick to
it. Then ‘he spoke of the responsibility
resting upon the students to show them-
selves worthy of the confidence that the
alumni have placed in them by giving
their money and their interest. The
continued applause which Mr. Fetzer
received was an excellent tribute to the
fact that he holds a warm place in the
heart of every man on the campus.

RECEPTION ON CAMPUS.

From Shearer Hall the meeting ad-
journed to that part of the campus ad-

freshments ‘were served. Among. those

much enjoyed by all.

NEW CONSTITPUTION
ADOPTED

At a full meeting of the student body
on’ Monday morning, a thoroughly re-
vised and remodeled Constitution of
Student Body Government was carefully
considered and adopted. Many cases
had shown the inefficiency and ambiguity
of the old Constitution, and a new one
was urged last spring. Alfred Scarbor-
ough, president of the Student Body,
was fortunately able to secure the able
assistance in framing it of a distinguished
Davidson alumnus, Associate Justice
Frasier, of the Supreme Court of South
Carolina, and the result has been a clear,
concise, well-worded Constitution upon
which to base the student government.
Many new ideas and suggestions have
been incorporated, viz., provision for the
mode of election of Students’ Council-
men, an oath to be taken by the Stu-
dents’ Councilmen before taking office. a
clear statement of the limtt of jurisdic-
tion of the Council, a provision allowing
accused to meet their witnesses face to
face and cross-examine them, a section
giving the Council freedom as to the de-
gree of penalty, and a clear, definite!
mode of procedure upon appeal of the
Council’s decision to the student body
Lastly comes the Moral Code. summed
up in four sentences, by which the coun.
cil is to act. Many of the old details a
to the working of the Student Govern.
ment are retained, but the present Con
stitution is essentially a new one, and :
great improvement. It has been adoptec
by the student body, and deserves now
such earnest support as will prove it"
efficiency and effectiveness. The revise”
Constitution will appear in the Y. M
C. A. Handbook, which will appear nex:
