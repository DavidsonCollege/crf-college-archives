With THE BEACHBALL

THE MAD THINKER

Once again there is a
gathering of facts from which
to choose, for us to expound
on. IMAC had about 18 games
this past’ week with the
headliner being the first all-

female flickerball game on the <

hitherto celibate lower soccer
field, between the Zoo and the
Sty.

Fifty slightly horny fans
crowded_the sidelines hoping
for a torn jersy or a heavy tog.
Both teams played well on
defense, expecially as their
squads were aided by a basic
inability of most the par-

ticipants to catch the ball, or .

throw it much theless...
In the Davidson tradition
the game was a fine defensive

struggle, Oh; yeah, the Zoo did

Cs

win the game 60 as Laurie
Dunn scampered around right
end for a five yard TD and ad-
ded a pike that would have
made Elmo Wright proud.
Maybe next year Sty, but both
teams are equally matched
and played hard in a fine con-
test.

SAE¥3 showed that the
Coach and Six should stay on
the tennis courts as_ they
‘picked up an 18-6 triumph that
Saw no team score an extra
point.

The Chocolate Speedway did
not show for their first game
with the Cleveland Indians
which only means they are
worthless, as people. Don’t
join the damn league if you’re
not going to show up or Bowie
will slap your buns.

In a tune-up for the big mat-
ch Tuesday the 8th, Watts 3&4,
the Sty, lost to Xmanon 26-7 as
the boys from Noname con-
trolled the game all over the

INVISIBLE TACKLE ~

field.

Tuesday’s action the Heavy
Metal kids nee Clap hurt aging
powerhouse Delt #1, 53-20, led

by Ronnie Powell. Krionce #l,

man and John Tatums led the
defense toa win.

Next Monday the Kids
followed up with an exciting
45-40 win over the KAs on the

last play of the game as Bill «

(Roids) Lloyd led a comeback
charge for the Kids.

We remember when the |

Pikas were great. Now they
have reached the lowest of

the ATOs. The ATOs clipped —

hapless zeroes.

Cat Ruggers Down Wofford,
Drop Duke Douable-Header

By BILL KELLY
Staff Writer

The Davidson Rugby Club
won the first home game
against Wofford, Sunday Sept.

* The speedy running of
;Davidson’s Chris Young and
Peter Alford kept Wofford in
constant trouble.

The first half of the game’

was spent mostly near the
Wofford Sah but a sur:
prising]: lense an
venalties kept Davidson from
putting the game out of reach.
‘However, Pete Alford found
a hole in the Wofford backfield
and used the cpportunity to
score. Jeff Heslop made the
conversion kick to make the

score 6-0.

Wofford made a rally when
they made a three point
penalty kick in Davidson

The rally didn’t last long
before Davidson’s Victor Mac-
Millan scored a try on a good
run. Unfortunately for the
Cats, the score was called
‘back because of a penalty.

The momentum was on
Davidson’s side, though, as
Chris Young dashed across
the goal near the end of the fir-
st half.

With the conversion kick by
Heslop, the score at half-time
was 12-3. ‘

The second half started in
Wofford’s favor as Davidson
was caught by surprise during
a 23-yard drop kick. A Wofford.
back made a long run and
scored. The kick was good,
and the score was 12-9.

Davidson broke the game
open soon after when wing
forward Jeff Heslop broke
through for a try. The David-
son scrum continued with very
aggressive play led by Jeff
Morrow. |

Morrow routed the Wofford
team as he scored three tries.
The conversion kicks were
good, two of which were made
by Fred Smith.

The game ended with a last
moment rally by Wofford with

a try, but to no avail as David-

son won 36-15. .
Last Sunday, Oct. 6; was a
double header against Duke

University here at Davidson.
The powerful Duke Blue
Devils ave the Wildcat
ruggers a tough time.

Both teams played equally
well in the first half of the
opener. A Duke back, after.
having the ball in their own
territory, broke lose on a long
run and advanced the ball to
the Davidson 10 before he was
stopped. Despite a tough ;
defensive effort by Davidson,
Duke-scored-soon after.

The conversion kick was
good, making the score 6-0 in
Duke's favor.

Before the half ended,
Davidson’s Henry Barber took
eee of a penalty again-

again as they belted R-II 32-13
