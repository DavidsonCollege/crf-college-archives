Faculty Housing

Set to Begin in October

By Tosh Crystal
As the size of the college
steadily expands, there has become
-an increased need to house the
expanded staff and faculty at
Davidson, The trick, however, is
to provide accommodations near
the school, rather than sacrifice the
community feeling by having fac-
ulty and staff in Cornelius or far-

ther away from Davidson.

In pursuit of this goal, the col-:

lege is going forward with plans to
develop faculty and staff housing
on.the McConnell Pond property,
a 198 acre area on Concord Road.
John Cameron Morrison, an em-
ployee at the Davidson College
Development Corporation volun-
teered information about the
project.

The college is going to use the

lard to construct small residences
aroundacentral parkon McConnell
pond itself. The actual construc-
tion is set to begin in October, and
the project is slated to be finished
in 5 to 7 years. Despite this long-
term completion date, occupancy.
is expected to begin by March of
1993. Although this occupancy
date may seem ambitious,
Morrison has no doubts about it.
“This is notambitious, this is abso-
lutely going to happen.”

With enthusiasm, like that, it
seems certain that the project is
going smoothly, and the Davidson
College Development Corporation
is leading the effort to bring the
Davidson College Community and
the whole town of Davidson closer
together by the 21st century.

people doing what they do.” He
asserts that his goal as a photog-

Princeton Review!

We know you guys like to party a lot. But still,
is anybody minding the store?

You failed to notice an important change in the LSAT.
The question format that you call Triple True/False,
which used to appear in all sections of the LSAT, has
not appeared on the LSAT since February 1991.
But you still prep your students to “crack” this
obsolete question format.

That's wasted cracking, guys. May we suggest that
you briefly disregard your margaritas, and
update your LSAT course materials? We know it's
work, but somebody's gotta do it.
