SIDELIGHTS

BY BILL PRIDGEN
SNYDER SETS NEW RECORD
Freshman Dick Snyder put in quite a performance at

the physical proficency tests this year. Not only did he
b the old total score record but he broke it by over 85
points. Snyder’s score of 633.8 tops Tom Ross’ old record
of 547.6, set in 1959.

Although Snyder did not break a event
record, he came very close in two of them. softball
throw of 288 feet was only two feet off the record, and
he missed the yard dash record by only .1 second.
(And he didn’t even run track in high school.)

Snyder is just another of the fine athletes brought to
this school through the efforts of Coach ‘Lefty’ Driesell.

The remainder of the freshman class failed to put
in such a fine performance. There were no other out-
standing individual performances and the class perform-
ance as a whole was below last year’s freshmen.

The Indians, always primed
for this game, are riding on a
new wave of school spirit
brought about by Harvey
Stratton, new Catawba head
coach. Pres Muller, formerly
head coach, resigned last year
to return to Lexington High

109 of the boys taking the test failed it, which
represents about forty percent of the class. In 1961, only
twenty-five percent of the freshmen failed to pass the

test.

TWO NEW TENNIS COURTS

Two new fast drying tennis courts are being added
to the upper courts by the gymnasium, which raises the
total number of courts on campus to eleven.

Future tennis matches will all be played on the upper
courts. This will come as good news to tennis players
who often can’t find a free court. We hope more courts
will be added in the future.

FALL PRACTICE FOR TENNIS TEAM

Tennis and soccer coach Harry Fogleman will be
taking on added duties this fall as he hopes to hold
regular fall practice for the netmen. This is a commenda-
ble effort and should show a positive effect on the team’s
performance this oeing.

Athletic Director Tom Scott also plans to keep his
golfers in practice during the off season.

Much activity is going on in Johnston ——
these days with the sanding and refinishing of the Basket-
ball court. It should be looking good by the time they’re

SALZER JOINS FOOTBALL STAFF

Bill Salzer, former tackle and co-captain of last year’s
’Cats squad is back here this fall helping out the coaching
staff as varsity line coach.

Salzer was a fine ballplayer and we are sure he will

do just as fine a job coaching.

Yearly Cake Race
Set For Freshmen

BY JIM HARDWICK
Sports Staff Writer

The Class of ’66 will vie for sixty homemade cakes in
the thirtieth annual freshman Cake Race Monday at 4
p.m.

The Cake Race is an annual
cross-country run for freshmen

initiated in 1933 by Coach Whit-
tle in order to arouse interest
in track among the freshmen
students.

The cakes are furnished by
the wives of the faculty and ad-
ministration.

The 1.7 mile contest is run
over a grueling course. Starting
over part of the cross-country,
the course then turns up a long

field cinder track.
All frosh are to report to the
soccer field at 3:45 p.m. wearing

School, where he had coached
| for many years before moving
to Catawba.

| Experience was the Indians
big weapon against the ‘Cat
eleven.-The team that Catawba
threw against the ‘Cats was es-
sentially the same team they had
| last season

| There are notable exceptions,
however. Gone from the Indian
lineup is George Worthington,
|a star halfback who “could have
starred for any team in the na-
tion,” according to Dole. Cataw-

ba also lacks Ray Oxendine who
sparked in the last meeting of
the two teams.

Dole carried two full units
into the game which are capa-
ble of going both ways, offen-
sively and defensively. Having
two teams is insurance against
any player becoming too tired
on the field, and should elim-
inate the fourth quarter drag
that plegued the ‘Cats in sev-
eral games last season.

“Dole is quick to point out that
neither of these teams should be
considered as first or second
string units, having divided his
talent evenly among both
groups.

Last spring Dole had plan-
ned to run an extra all defen-
sive unit, but the loss of some
key players forced him to
scratch this idea.

Experience, if it works for
Catawba, works against the 'Cats
in several positions, especially
at end and fullback.

Not one of the starting ends
on Dole’s two squads had any
varsity experience before to-
night.

Tonight’s Co-captains

The co-captains of tonight's game with Catawba are
Bob Cordle and Mike Owen, both senior footballers
from Charlotte.

Cordle, who uses his fine speed and agility well
in the halfback slot, is also a star sprinter for the
track team. He is a member of ODK, honorary lead-
a and he has served on the student
council.

Owen, a tackle for the Wildcats, has been chosen to
the Scholastic All-American football team. Besides foot-
ball, Owen is Chairman of the Honor Court and President
of ODK.

The co-captains for each week are chosen by
Coach Bill Dole from the seniors who he thinks are
peor | hard and who also possess leadership
potential.

At the end of the season the team will choose per-
manent co-captains by elections.

year’s squad include Tarby
Bryant, Walt Eckman, Don Mc-
Queen, Bob Meldrum, Mike
Nemir, Charlie Sassar, captain
of this year's team, Fred Schoen,
and Bill Wallace.

Fogleman has noticed a
“definite interest” in soccer
g the freshmen class, but
Davidson has no freshmen soc-
cer team.

The season opens October 4th

oalies, we should be as strong as last year’s team.”

ception that South Carolina will
not be played. Last year the
team wound up with a 54
record.

Fogleman pointed out that
many of the small college foes
have no football team, so that
soccer is their main fall sport.

Other boys expected to add
strength and depth to this year’s
team are Toby Bethea, Jan
Brake, Jim Bulla, Glen Hanes,
Dave Olin, Zack Smith, Bruce
Swain, Frank Tullock, and Ab-
bott Whitney. The big problem
is to find two men to fill the
key position of goalie.

Fogleman, besides coaching
soccer, intends to begin fall ten-
nis practice in about two weeks,
or as soon as the new tennis
courts are completed. Davidson
used to be a power house in
southern tennis, and Fogleman,
with a “half-dozen excellent
freshmen tennis players is try-
ing to regain lost glory.

About 34 boys have turned out for a freshman football team which Coach Threl-
keld seems to think is one of the best that Davidson will produce.

Even after a few days of con-
tact, the team seems to be shap-
ing up well, Threldkeld was
pleased and optimistic after the
team ran some Catawba plays
against the varsity.

Score
Last Year
21-1

There was some concern
last year about depth, but this
year, with twice the number
of boys, Threldkeld and Pierce
foresee @ great deel more
everall strength with depth,
particularly on the heavy line.

Lack of balance in past fresh-

|; man teams has usually been a
major problem, but the problem

is considerably less this year.

A combination of two fine
quarterbacks, who can run as
well as pass, Sydney Tompkins
and John Little, and a set of
good receiving ends should di-
versify the offense. Paul Am-
brose, a good swing end with
sure hands, has showed well and
seems to be moving well.

Phil Hightower can also be
described es aggressive and
sure, Stewart Perry hes been
moved from tackle to end end
is doing well.

The coaches have little to
worry about in the backfield
with Steve Smith, Phil Wells,
and Jerry Blackstock at half,
and Pack Hindsley at fullback.

ocasermuansn

Threldkeld anticipates quite a

a

few other boys to give help as
the season gets underway.

He is running two units this
year, offensive and defensive,
with several boys going both
ways. The Kittens have a four
game schedule, starting with
The Citadel on Oct, 11.

The only home game is with
Furman on Oct. 20. This sched-
ule should offer the class of
66 a chance to prove that they
are “mean as hell and tough as
bricks.”

Sophs Will Help
Cross-Country

Cross Country Coach Heath
Whittle is counting on sopho-
mores up from last year’s fine
freshman team to give him the
“strongest cross country team in
many years.”

The season opens October 3 at
Wake Forest.

Joining Sterling Martin, last
year’s number one man, and Tim
Spiro, whe was number three,
are sophomores Dennis Phillips,
Chester Davis, Tom Heffner, and
Ronnie Reese. These six boys
and lettermen Bob Leslie and
Charlie Rowe should form the
nucleus of the team.

Looking at the schedule,
Coach Whittle picked Wake For-
est, Furman and V.M.I. as the
tough meets, stating that these
teams are subsidized and that it
is difficult for an unsubsidized
team to beat them.

He also picked West Virginia,
V.M.1.,, and Furman as the teams
to beat in the Southern Confer- |
ence. }
