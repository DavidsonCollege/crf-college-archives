Questions Asked at Each Meet-

Vitally Concerned About
College Affairs

Four interesting and lively meetings
of local alumni associations, were held
during the Christmas holiday season at
Atlanta, Ga., Orlando, Fla., St. Petrs-
burg, Fla., and Jacksonville, Fla. The
widespread prevalence of influenza
and the absence of many men from
the various cities on short vacations
decidedly hampered the size of the
bodies meeting, but the keen interest
and loyalty displayed by the ones who
attended made the holiday gatherings
worth while.

Ernest Milton, alumni secretary, met
with each of the associations, and
brought to them current and perti-
nent facts about the college and its
affairs. An open forum discussion was
conducted after each talk he made,
and questions relating to the future
growth of Davidson, the fraternity sit-
uation here, the cost of an education
at Davidson, the athletic outlook, and
others occupied .a considerable
ton of the time.

Atlanta Meeting

Davidson alumni in Atlanta and De-
catur held their meeting at the Henry
Grady Hotel in Atlanta, the group
gathering for dinner at 6:30 p. m. Rev.
Wade H. Boggs, D.D., retiring presi-
dent of that organization, presided,
and carried through a program which
included a talk by Rev. D. P. Mc-
Geachey, D.D., of Decatur, on “The
Davidson of Yesterday ;” one by R. O.
Flinn, Jr., a senior at Davidson, on
“The Davidson of Today,” and another

Ss.

at 6. p.m. The meeting was informal,
many matters pertaining to Davidson
being discussed during the course of
the dinner, <A constitution and by-
laws for that association was adopted
and officers elected. It was vated that
the new secretary should send out to
alumni of that association a letter, tell-
ing them about the meeting. It was
also suggested that an alumni meeting
for the entire state of Florida be pro-
posed to the officers of all associa-
tions, Orlando being tentatively sug-

gested as the most logical point. After
dinner, the alumni adjourned for a
smoker.

Northeast Florida

The meeting of the Northeast Flori-
da Association at Jacksonville had
been planned originally to follow the
Atlanta meeting, but due to illness of
a number of men and absence from
the city of others, it was postponed un-
til the return trip of the alumni secre-
tary. He spent an hour and a half in
the city between trains and met with
an interested group of alumni at din-
ner at the George Washington Hotel.
John D. Baker, Sr., presided in the ab-
sence of the president, Dr. W. M.
Shaw, who was ill, and immediately
began an informal discussion of Da-
vidson, due to the brief time the sec-
retary would be in the city. A large
portion of the time was spent in talk-
ing about the situation of fraternities
at Davidson during the past several
years, followed by other channels of
thought. New officers had not been
elected when the secretary left, and no
report has been received as to further
action of the association.

by Rev. D. P. McGeachy, D.D., when

The frequency of queries from in-
dividuals about their friends and
classmates leads to the conclusion that
a new Alumni Catalogue, extensively
advertised and containing even more
data than the one published in 1924,
would receive a wide distribution, Even
though two of the alumni were told
that the present catalogue contained
addresses which had changed since its
issuance, these two men insisted that
they wanted a copy. The secretary
mailed them after his return to Da-
vidson, {

When the*-alumni secretary meets
with alumni he generally gets an ear-
ful of criticisms. One which has been
frequently encountered during the fall
was that in reference to the tuition
fees at Davidson College. Some should
be taken to clarify the minds of
alumni, giving .them statistical data
and information which the
justification of the increase.

shows

Dr. Oren Moore, ’o8, of Charlotte,
has been introduced over the radio in
Charlotte as the “Will Rogers of Da-
vidson.” Anyone who heard Dick
Flinn, senior at Davidson, talk to the
Atlanta alumni would rightly conclude
that Dr. Moore will have a successor,
Mr. Flinn discussed “The Davidson of
Today” and sandwiched many jokes
and anecdotes between his serious re-
marks, which kept his hearers in an
uproar,

Perhaps it would not be amiss for

ing. Some true facts and some ‘erron-
eous ones have come to the minds of
Davidson alumni, many of whom are
vitally interested in the institution,

Because of the questions propound-
ed during the various meetings held
during the Christmas holidays, it is
concluded that the alumni interest in
the college is keen. It is also believed
that some periodical containing in-

formation about the college and its
component parts would be a medium
of keeping them well-informed and
would give them up-to-date informa-
tion directly from the officials.

In addition to numerous new ad-
dresses or changes of address which
were obtained on the trip, information
was received about the marriage of
two alumni, and considerable data
about individual men, which affords
the secretary a personal contact with
alumni.
