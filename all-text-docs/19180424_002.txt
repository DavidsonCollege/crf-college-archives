Roanoke may well be proud of its de-
baters—excellent speakers, gentlemanly
and sportsmanlike in conduct. We hope
the best of relations may ever continue
between the two institutions.

This Flanders drive has a) sobering
effect. on everyone. We are perhaps
thinking just a little more seriously than
we-did before. Are the classes going to
buy Liberty Bonds again this spring?

Only thirty-one more days and we
“hop” that train for Home.

Did you ever realize. how fortunate
(or perhaps unfortunate) a collepe man
of today ‘is in living in the most lively
times the world has ever known?

We wonder how many of the. stu-
dents ever read anything besides — the
sporting news and Life in the reading
room.

Drill is a thermometer, Its pepless-
ness conclusively indicates a rise in tem-
perature.

NOTICE.
In last week's paper there appeared
under the head of Le Cercle Francais an

objectionable article in. French = which
should not have been published. “Phe

editors are not French students, and the
article was run in on faith, as previous
ones have been. We wish to beg the
pardon of those concerned, and will see
that it does not again occur.

Foon.

The following letter needs no explana-
tion. It was received recently by the
college authorities, whom we join in a
silent plea to the patriotism of the Da-
vidson student body, that you realize the
critical importance of — wheatless and
meatless days in the boarding houses.
The amount of wheat. saved at any one
place might not be much, but the wheat
saved by every place in the country to-
gether will feed our army to victory.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, April 24, 1918

Are we doing that little part? The
Director of the Collegiate Section of the
U. S. Food Administration writes:

“We are sending you a copy of a
speech made by Dr. Alonzo E. “Faylor.
of the Food Administration, at the mecet-
ing of hotel men in the New Willard
Hotel, Washington, D. C.. March 29.
1918.

“This speech is a powerful appeal and
should be read by every college man and
woman, Will you not bring up the
question before your students of abstain-
ing from wheat for the rest’ of the col-
lege year? “Doubtless many of them
would be willing to help induce others
to make the same sacrifice. Such action
would be a great service to our present
emergency.”

The portions of Dr. “Taylor's speech
which apply to us follow:

“We have got to reach the place. each
one of us, where we define every decision
in our lives as an act of war policy.
Everything that we do—plan, eat, wear
—imust be analyzed and measured from
one single point of view —will it con

tribute te the carrying on of the war,

or will it) contribute to its prolonga-
tion, “Uhere is no other thing in’ the
world for us but to define everything in
our lives as acts of military necessity or
policy.

“The first necessity for us is to get a
clear-conception of the relation of wheat
in the human diet and to divest ourselves
of all preconceptions that a life ot gen-
erations of case, indolence, and lusury
has bred in us.

“Our predilection for wheat is solely
a question of taste, comfort and conven-
ience; it is absolutely nothing — else.
Wheat makes the nicest bread, the light-
est bread, the bread that is transported
best, the bread that keeps moist and
sweet longest. Because it lends itself to
the convenience of a people, we want it
sent to Europe and not kept here, and
we ask and expect the American man
and woman in judging of every situation
as contrasted with that of our Allies,
men and women, to ask who has the
larger burden to bear, who has borne tt
the longest. who has wasted in’ resources
the most, who has lost the most by sacri-
fice, who has suffered the most in death
and destruction, we or our Allies? And
when we have a choice to decide as to
whether we or they should increase or
decrease our burden, it ought to be not
the duty, but the joyful privilege of every
American te lessen the burden of every
min, womansand child in the Allied
countries of Europe, by accepting the
heavier burden on this side. And be-
cause wheat is easier to prepare than
vats and rice and barley —that is the very
best reason in the world why we ought
to accept the oats and the rice and barley
and to give them the wheat that ts nec-
essary to maintain a normal ration.

“We have all to decide whether we
will serve the Allies. who need help the
most, or whether we will serve ourselves
who need it less. We had better begin
serving the Allies now,

“We have just sent over two of the
best food experts of the United States
to Furope, and what is the | striking
thing contained in their letters from Lon-
don and Paris? ‘Phe thing that struck
them the most was the scarcity of food
in the best hotels of those two cities.

“LE wish every man in this room could
vo to the battlefield of France, could ga
to the front, not merely to see what a
front looks like, with its trenches, its
men and all of the paraphenalia, but to
get the reaction of the French common
soldier toward the American _ visitor.
These men who have faced death for
three and a half years for you and me.
fighting a battle in which we have just
as much at stake as they have—these men
salute an American civilian with an ex-
pression of respect, reverence, and trust
that is absolutely past description by
human words.

“Why do these French soldiers. who
have struggled with death for freedom
for three and a half years. salute the
American? Because in that salute they
express their trust in America in the
war; they express the trust in our as-
suming our share of this struggle from
every point of view. not merely by gov-
ernmental participation in a.military pro-
gran, but also by the reconstruction of
our ‘entire lives from the point of view
of saving and. sacrifice, by supporting
them in the same sense that the American
boy who fights beside them, supports
them, and is supported by them.

“Now, we, gentlemen. must — be
worthy of this tritst. and when a French
coldier salutes an American civilian and
he knows that that American is merely
one typical of a hundred and five mil-
lion, he expects us to do our duty as
an ally, and he knows we will do it.
The people of France know that the
American people are being asked to un-
dergo food conservation and — they
know that the man who asks them to un
dergo it is the man best qualified in the
world to lay out a program—the Hoover
of Northern France and Belgium and
now the Hoover ofythe United States.”

NORMAN JOHNSON WILL SPEAK TOMOR-
" ROW EVENING.

13, will speak to rhe Yo M. C. A. in

dents know him) personally, while all
