Frank Price Speaks
To Undergraduates

Rey. Frank Price, a prominent Davidson
alumnus and an outstanding mission worker
in China, brought a challenging message
from the East to the youth of America dur-
ing his four-day stay here, April 4th to
7th. He spoke both to the classes concerned
especially with his work and at the chureh
and vesper services on Sunday.

Political
for China

In to the classes in.
Science he said that the outlook
politically was bright under the Nationalist
Government. He enumerated the im-
provements and reforms this party is organ
izing and bringing about for the good .of
China despite the disorganized condition of
the country within

At the Bible and Philosophy classes Mr.
Price spoke on Christianity’s great oppor-
tunity in China at this critical stage in her
history when she is laying aside from her
old religions and = searching after truth.
Along the line of philosophy he said that
China the of the Orient
and that she has many fine qualities in her
philosophical systems which may serve as
a splendid background for Chinese Chris-
tianity and many of which we would
well to take over. He called it to our atten-
tion that China at the present going

cial, and religious revolution all at the same

it is only natural that an upheaval should
result in China under the circumstances.

At the church service Sunday morning
he emphasized the challenge of the Far
East to America today to make our Nation
more Christian as they look to us as a
model. He vividly refuted the statement that
the romance and adventure of the mission
field in China was dying out. As he sees it
at present he said the object of the mis-
sionary is not to impose the ideas of his
particular denomination on them but to
awaken in them the need of God.

Sunday evening at the vesper service he
painted another challenging picture. ‘As I

“Quips and Cranks”
Almost Complete

The 1930 edition of Quips and Cranks is
almost for the according to
C. M. Pratt, editor. All of the engravings
have been in,

ready press,

sent and the proof is being
read on most of the copy. According to the
specifications of the printers, all of the copy
must be back to them by the tenth of April.
Only the athletic section remains to be com-
pleted, and prospects are that this will be
complete by the set date.

According to W. R. Hill, business man-
ager of the annual, the edition this year will
not be quite as large as the one last year,
but it will require a little more expense, due
to some new features which are in the new
book.

For many years the Davidson annual has
been considered one of the finest college
year books in the country. Not infrequently
it has won great distinction in contests with
other schools. The 1927 edition of the book
was voted the best year book in the United
States for colleges which have an enroll-
ment under 1,000.

According to the editors, the Quips and
Cranks will be issued about one or two
weeks before: the end of school.
