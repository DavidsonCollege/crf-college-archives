SGA to study Court space problems

By CHUCK KENNON
Managing Editor

The problem of over-
crowding and lack of additonal
space in eating houses on
Patterson Court is being
investigated by a committe for
the Student Government
Association. Sophomore Phil
Caine stated that the final
S.G.A. report would be
submitted for-study by the
Trustees during their .spring
meeting.

‘This year there wasn’t
enough space for everyone to
get in where they wanted, and
the niatter is going to be worse
in the fall because many
freshmen were unable to select
the house of their choice.
There is a long waiting list and
unless something is done it
will only get worse in the

coming years,”’ Caine
observed.
He then said, ‘‘Self-

selection will work but only if
there is enough space for
everyone. Without sufficient
room on the court people will
become dissatisfied with self-
selection. So we are telling the
Trustees that if they don’t
provide for a solution they will
lose self-selection.’’ He added
that he feel the Trustees are
still committed to self-
selection and will act to
preserve it.

“In our report we want to
examine every possible alter-
native, including remodeling
houses,’’ said Currie. He
continued, ‘‘I think the report
will lean toward ideas involv-
ing simple constuction to add
more seating space.

“We could take the apart-
ments from house mothers and
expand by knocking down a
wall or two,. A more expensive
way would be to roof in patios,
and the most expensive solu-
tion would be te ild a new
house.”’

Caine indicated that it was
unlikely Rusk houge would be
made into an eatirig house for
next year. ‘“‘Thg normal
proceedure, suck as was
followed by those: ho made

Etc., is to organize the house
before the self-selection
process occurs. It’s difficult to
make a viable house by just
gathering people who didn’t
get into a previous choice.
There wouldn’t be the feeling
of belonging and unity that
makes a house go.”

He then said that he under-
stood Ron Scott, director of
A.R.A. Slater, wanted to con-
tinue to have Rusk at his
disposal to serve as a banquet
and meeting site.

Caine concluded by stating
that ‘‘this report will only

point out short term solutions, .

but we believe that an
immediate handling of this
problem is necessary or the
self-selection program will be
jeopardized. We aren’t trying
to stir up argument or contro-
versy, but to just meet a
need.”

On Friday, the center of

dance at 2:00. Dancing will
continue all night with a
campus-wide dance running

Saturday’s highlights will
include a parade through the

that will halt at the baseball
field, where kegs of beer will
be tapped.

A miniconcert by the group
Rosewater Blue will begin at
2:00 pm. A recent review
characterized Rosewater
Blue’s music as ‘‘consisting of
a diverse blend of instru-
ments: six-string acoustic gui-
tar, electric bass; twelve-
string acoustic guitar, acous-
tic and electric pianos, mand-
olin, drums, pedal steel, and
harmonicas.

“Their vocals blend a well-
refined diversity and range,
assisting their lyrical content
by creating a unique air of
moods and feelings for their
listeners.”’

Mayer said that Sunday

One of Walter’s primary
objectives is to salvage as
much of the recruiting season
as possible. He said it would
require ‘‘a lot of work’’ and
said that he could not
predict how the season would
go, other than that he would
“strive for quality.”’

Walters said that he tends
to tavor the East coast, and
indicated that he was not too
familiar with the West. ‘‘With
a school as academically de-
manding as Davidson, how-
ever, you have to recruit
nationwide,’’ he said.

He said that one aim would
be ‘‘to recruit some quickness.

ick, able players give you a
lot of flexibility as a coach.”

Walters is pleased about
coming to Davidson. ‘‘I have a
great respect for the tradition
that was established by Lefty
Driesell,” he said. ‘‘I’m happy
coming to a school that main-
tains a solid basketball pro-
gram and at the same time has
excellent academics.”

“It’s a unique school from
that point,’’ he continued.

Walters sees no conflict
between academics and ath-
letics.

Cartmill indicated that the
college has no intention of
lowering its academic stand-
ards to provide for scholarship
athletes.

Walters will bring his Dart-
mouth assistants, Gary Dico-

head coach Bo Brickels, will
