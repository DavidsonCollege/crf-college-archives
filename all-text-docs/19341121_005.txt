THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 21,

1934

DAVIDSON TEAMS
AND PLAYERS OF
PROT RECALLED

Johnny Mackorell Included On
All-Time Davidson Team Se-
lected By Charlotte Paper

Spectacular spots in Davidson's foot-
ball history are the 38-6 victory, over
Georgia Tech in 1900, the 1906 champ-
ionship team, the 1926 State champions,
Joe McCall’s 55 yard run for a touch-
down against Army in 1930 and David-
son’s memorable 13-12 victory over Duke
in 1929,

It was, in the latter game that Thad
Brock ran 102 yards from behind his goal
line to be downed on the five yard line,
the play leading to a score. Brock, an
end, was one of the best kickers in the
State. Davidson had made gallant
stand on the seven yard line, holding the
Devils for four downs, and Brock was
called back to punt. Sceing a-hole, he
went through it for a run of 102 yards
before being pulled down.

a

Another speedy player in the days of
Brock was Joe McCall, the aforemen-
tioned player making a touchdown
against ‘Army. He was the leading
ground gainer for the Cats, honorable
mention for All-American and one of the
best broken field runners ever to per-
form in the Old North State.

In 1915 Monk Younger entered David-
son and although a freshman, was named
an All-South Atlantic end. -In 1923, he,
with Tex Tilson as backfield coach,
came back to begin the longest coaching
reign in Davidson's history. They both
left in 1931,

The reign of Younger and Tilson is
itself an era in Davidson's history.
Gloomy Monk, as he was called, never
made a happy prediction. They infused
in their teams much of the spirit that has
become a Davidson tradition. Their style
of play, as described by ‘Professor
Blythe, called for the line buck very
often. The quick kick and the forward
pass were also well developed.
men produced the 1926 State Champions.

Coaches Newton and McEver exper-
ienced their first season here in 1931 and
we run the risk of editorializing by say-
ing that they have continued Davidson's
reputation for clean, fast and hard-
fighting football. These coaches have-de-
veloped Johnny Mackorell and the pres-
ent edition of. Wildcats who have per
formed brilliantly against teams from in-
stitutions recently gone “big time”.

An All-Time Davidson football team
was selected by popular vote conducted
by the Charlotte News (in the spring of
1934), and the result consists of a sort
of “honor roll” of Davidson football.
Johnny Mackorell was elected quarter-
back on this mythical eleven. Buck
Flowers, Dick Grey and Jack Black
compose the rest of the backfield.

Thad Brock and DeWitt Kluttz, ends;
Lawrence Hammett and) ‘Tom Baker,
tackles; Hugh Grey, and Billy Sayad,
guards, and Buddy Gardner, center, com-
plete the roster of the immortal. John-
ny Mackorell is the youngest of the hon-
ored players and DeWitt Kluttz, '07, is
the oldest.
of Dr. and Mrs. Grey of Davidson, Hugh
playing in 1917 and Dick in 1927. Teams
coached by Bill Fetzer in 1916 and 1917
landed three berths on the first team and
Fetzer himself received the
third team.

Davidson's greatest victory came in
1905 over Oak Ridge, 75-0 and _ their
greatest loss was to Georgia Tech in
1920, 0-66. In 1927, the year that Geor-
gia Tech beat Cumberland Cdllege 222-0,
Davidson only was beaten 10-32, so had
Davidson gotten a crack at Cumberland
that year, we might boast of a 200-0
victory ...

From 1899 to 1933, opponents of David-
son on the gridiron have scored on the
Wildcats 2,207 points and the ’Cats have
roiled up a total of 3,050 points. David-
son’s high scoring year came in 1917
under Coach Bill Fetzer, scoring 254
points against their opponents 116, In
that year Wake Forest was beaten 73-7.
And if you doubt the authenticity of the
foregoing you may spend a pleasant af-
ternoon in the basement of the library
exploring the annuals and records left
by former classes.

After doing so, you will find that
you know much more about Davidson
than you did before. You will discover

All-Americans End
Season On Monday

Under Direction Of Unger, Team
Wins Three Games, Loses
One, And Ties One

Davidson's 1934 edition of its  tradi-
tional “All American”, under the direc-
tion of Coach Unger, wound up its play-
ing season last. Monday by trouncing a
scrapping Belmont Abbey team 8-6.

The-reserve team played five contests
this year, defeating Wingate Junior Col-

lege, Belmont Abbey, and the Charlotte
Bulldogs. They tied Campbell College
0-0, and lost a close decision to Mars
Hill.

Although it was a reserve team, the
AM American outfit was studded with
stars Such men as Van Patterson,
giant tackle, Bill Quick, brilliant quar-

terback, Jim Johnston, Heman Clark, and
Jim Hodgins were the oustanding per
formers, and for them Coach Unger had
special praise.

In a statement to the Davidsonian, the
mentor thanked the boys for the spirit
shown throughout the season,

“The have all

Unger said, “And some

boys worked hard,”
