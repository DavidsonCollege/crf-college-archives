Peace Corps’ Omo
Tells Of Turkish Life

By JIM COOLEY
Steff Writer

Peace Corps volunteer Larry
Omo, who served in Turkey for
two years, presented a back-
ground of the Peace Corps and
several personal experiences at
Monday's chapel.

In October, 1964, Omo arid his
wife were sent to Turkey, not
knowing what type of work they
would be doing. After an eight-
day orientation program in An-
kara, they were sent to a small
village and assigned to “rural
community development.”

Omo spent the first four
months in the community’s three
coffee houses until he was fluent
in the language. During this per-
iod and the remainder of his
service, Omo indicated that he
and his wife’s major accomplish-
ment was learning to appreciate
the viewpoint of the Turkish
people.

Omo used as examples two
projects which he and his wife
undertook to demonstrate how
easily cultural blunders can be
made.

In trying to start a kindergar-
ten, they failed to realize that
all of the villagers did not have
clocks. After announcing that
the kindergarten would meet at
9 a.m., the Omos found that the
children would arrive from 6:30
a.m. until past noon. The Omos
recognized their mistake and set
the time at the second prayer
call instead.

Another example of cultural
misunderstanding was their try-

Ensemble
Will Tour
Five States

The Wind Ensemble will begin
a week-long tour of five north-
ern states on Thursday.

The tour is the ensemble’s first
trip north and will range from
Alexandria, Va.. to Reading,
Mass. The group will also play
several concerts in New York
state, plus concerts in Maryland
and New Jersey.

The Wind Ensemble's program
varies from light to heavy —
from Grafulla’s “Washington
Grays March" to Giannini's
“Third Symphony."

Arnold Hinden, a sophomore
from Winter Park, Fla., and
David Hoag, a senior from Char-
lotte, will be featured soloists
this year. Hinden has the clari-
net solo in ‘Tico-Tico’’ which
has been arranged especially for
him by Dr. Williams.

This yeat’s ensemble piece,
Louis Spohr’s “Nocturno for
Turkish Band.’ features tri-
angles, cymbals, and a sarruso-
phone.

‘A sarrusophone,”” explained
Williams, ‘tis an obsolete band
instrument. It is one of the out-
growths of inventions made on
the saxophone. The Davidson
Music Department obtained this
instrument in payment of a debt
which a student had to ‘pay be-
fore graduating.”

ing to institute washboards for
washing clothes. The Turkish
women usually beat their clothes
clean at the village horse trough.
The Omos’ demonstration of the
practicality of the washboard
was well-received by the vil-
lagers, but no washboards were
requested because the horse
trough was an important place
of social contact among the vil-
lagers.

Before leaving for Turkey,
Omo had undergone a three-
month training program in the
language of the country. He
spent six hours a day, six days
a week in intensive study.

Other areas of emphasis in the .

training program were the his-
tory and culture of the area as-
signed, a brush-up course in
American history and a physi-
cal training program.

There are now about 14,000
Peace Corps volunteers in 55
countries of Latin America,
Africa, the Middle East and the
Far East. The newest program
is now underway in South Korea.

Foundation Instigates
Leadership Program

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer |

The Richardson Foundation
has recently chosen Davidson
College as the location for a
three-year experimental project
for-developing leadership among
members of the freshman class.

Davidson is the second college
at which the foundation has
started such a project. The first
was Ohio University. where it
created ‘a great deal of excite-
ment and interest among the
students and has worked effec-
tively,"’ according to Davidson
head football coach Homer
Smith, chairman of the focal
project. ‘

The keynote of the experiment
is leadership. ‘‘The Richardson
Foundation is vitally interested
in young people, especially col-
lege students,” said Kirk Reed,
one of the two student members
of the committee working on this
project.

‘The foundation wants to nur-
ture their leadership talents as
much and as early as possible.
They are trying to determine
whether future leaders can be
found in the freshman year, and
if so, how this can best be done."
Reed continued.

According to a letter which
has recently been sent to 67
members of the freshman class,
the students will be selected on
the basis of “their high school
activities; their success in aca-
demics; the impressions made
on fellow students and on faculty
members; and the judgment of
men trained and experienced in
the selection of young men for
leadership positions in business,
government, education and the
professions.”

Smith commented that there
are three key benefits which the
students will receive from this

8 Faculty Committees
To Have More Students

(ED. NOTE: This is the second
ina series of four articles by
Mike Bates on the proposed
faculty constitution. Last week
Bates discussed the constitution
draft in general. This week he
examines the new committee
system as set up in the proposed
constitution.)

By MIKE BATES
Editorial Correspondent

The new committee system is
the very heart of the proposed
draft for a faculty constitution.
Therefore, the student role in
these committees is of great
significance for students and the
whole college.

At present the student body
has representatives on three of
the 30 standing committees of
the faculty. These are the Aca-
demic Scheduling Committee,
the Fallout Preparedness Com-
mittee and the Religious Pro-
gram Committee. The last com-
mittee has three student mem-
bers and the other two commit-
lees have one each.

REPRESENTATION

The proposed draft ‘provides
for student representation on
eight of 18 standing committees.
The eight are the Educational
Policy Committee, the Student
Life Committee, the Religious
Policy Committee, the Foreign
Study Committee. the Counsel-
ling and Guidance Committee.
the Artist Series and Public
Lectures Committee. the Col
lege Union. Fraternities ar}
Clubs Committee and the Build.
ing and Grounds Committee.

Each of the above committees
would have one student member.
In addition ‘there would be three
students on the Religious Pro.
gram Committee. which reports
to the Religious Policy Com.
mittee. Two of these three would
be nominated by the other mem.
bers of that committec.

“Any com.

may when necessary vote to
meet in executive session, with
students not being present for
such session’ (Article IV, 1 g).

In a commentary sent to the
faculty, Dr. Alan B. Brinkley,
chairman of the Faculty Consti-
tution Committee, makes very
clear the understanding that any
executive session would be ‘“‘an
exceptional case for which rea-
sons would be given to student
members.”

This is definitely the under-
standing which students have
about this clause. and it would
be quite desirable to have a
simple sentence stating this un-
derstanding in the constitution
itself.

MODERATE
Brinkley is accurate in point-
ing out elsewhere in his com-
mentary that the suggested in-
crease in student representation
is a moderate proposal. There
are numerous good reasons why

violations during:

almost every, faculty committee
should have at least one student
member.

Students have information and
a perspective which makes their
contribution to committee dis-
cussions especially valuable. In
addition, giving students real
responsibilities certainly en-
courages greater maturity and
responsibility to the student
body.

Placing two students on the
Blue Sky Committee has made
a great difference in general
student interest in the affairs of
this important committee.

On the other hand. it is diffi-
cult for students to have con-
cern for the business of com-
mittees which do not formally
value their opinion, by having
student members.

Several additional committees
in the proposed draft should
have student representation. The
following four are definitely in
this calegory: the Committee on
the Library, the Committee on
Athletics, the Committee on Ad-
missions and Financial Aid and
the Committee on the Budget.
The affairs of these committees
are of great concern to the entire
college community. not only the
faculty,

The faculty certainly realizes
the scope of their committees.
for a majority of the present
committees have non-faculty
members. Students have a
special and valuable contribu-
tion to make to the four com-
mittees named above as well
the eight committees of the
proposed draft.
