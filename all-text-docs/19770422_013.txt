Cats Slug double-win against VMI

By MIKE LINS
Staff Writer

The Wildcat Baseball team
travelled to Lexington, Va.
this past weekend to play VMI
in a Southern Conference
double header.

The Cats previously had
fared only 2-6 in Conference
games and therefore wanted to
get two wins from VMI. And
indeed, they came home with
two wins.

The first game wasa “‘slug-
fest’’ for the Cats, who
soundly downed the Keydettes
12-1. The powerful hitting was
led by Stan Brown, Pete
Legler, and Rick Blinkhorn.
These three ‘“‘sluggers’” each
had three hits. Brown and
Legler each had two doubles.

Freshman catcher Bob Lap-
ple also ripped a two-run
homer for the Cats. Alto-
gether, the Cats pounded out
seventeen hits against the
Keydette pitchers in the first
game.

In the second game, the
Cats jumped out to an early
lead and it appeared that the
VMI team was in for another
sound beating.

Pete Legler again led the

team with three hits. Senior

Jim Nichols and Bob Lapple
both had two hits and Bruce
Bolinger ripped a homerun as
well.

This gave the Cats a 10-3
lead over VMI. However, the
VMI team fought back from
10-3 to tie the Cats in the sixth
inning at 10-10.

For seven more innings the
game was a stand-off, with
neither team being able to
score. Then, in the top of the
thirteenth inning Stan Brown
ripped a double with Pete
Legler on second base to’ score
the winning run.

Freshman Bruce Bolinger’s
homerun was his seventh for
the year and the twenty-fifth

On Tuesday, the Davidson
Lacrosse team lost a heart-
breaking game to Elon 13-12.

With 45 seconds left in the
game, Bill Mebane scored his
5th goal of the game to tie the
game up at 12-all then with
just 12 seconds remaining,
Elon scored what proved to
be the game winner.

Mebane said he was pleased
with the game, since ‘we,
finally have proved that we’
can play respectable lacrosse.
Teams are going to Have to'
work to beat us now.’

He pointed out that only six)
or seven players on the team
had any real game experience,
but enthusiasm and a willing-
ness to work is really helping.
this team to improve quickly.”’

Mebane also felt that the’
team’s main weakness is that
they lack proper strategy and
coaching. i

But Mebane pointed out
that despite being on its own.
the whole season, the team has
done well for being so inexper- ;
ienced. Marked improvements |
in individual players is’
helping to spur the team on.

“We're starting to move the
ball around a lot better now. |
We're even starting to score a
lot of goals.”’

Attackman Alex Evans was
also pleased with the team’s
efforts but felt ‘‘it was very
disappointing to lose such a
tough game, especially after
we had come so close against
Clemson (12-9).”’

for the team. This breaks the
past Cat team homerun re-
cord, set in 1975.

Behind Bolinger, Tim Mc-
Dowell and Bob Lapple each
have four homeruns. Stan
Brown and Tim Goodell each
have three homeruns, whie
Dave Patton has two. Sid
Osborne and Pete Legler have
each hit one homerun. This
impressive record shows that
the Cats have eight starters
who are capable of hitting
homeruns.

this weekend was done by Tim

Barr and Alan Alig. Barr

first game and then pitched
the first five innings of the
next game.

Alig then pitched the final
eight innings of the thirteen
inning second game.

Earlier this week, Barr
broke the strike out record for
all Wildcat pitchers. The re-

cord was set in 1971 with 72'

strikeouts. Barr at present has
struck out 89 opposing batters
and the Cats still have eight
games to play.

One other record that was
broken this week is that of
stolen bases. Stan Brown

Pritchett asserts, ‘‘his
leadership, creativity, scoring
ability, overall basketbal]
knowledge certainly gave him
the opportunity to be the
finest point guard ever to wear

a Davidson uniform.

Chris was our first choice

broke the record he set last
year with nine stolen bases.
He has ten at present and
since the Cats have eight
games left he’ll have a chance
to improve on that record.

Coach Muench has claimed
all season that the talent on
this Cat team is abundant. As
these records are broken, this
fact is made evident.

Muench says that he hopes
most that the vital record of
win-losses will also be im-
proved for the 11-21 Cats.
With these eight games left to
play, the ‘‘hot”’ Cats certainly
have a chance to do just that.
