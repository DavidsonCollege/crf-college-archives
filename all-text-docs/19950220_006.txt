Week if Washington
White House tries to recover
fumbled Foster nomination

By ANDREA SHORT
Washington Week correspondent

Once again, Washington is
gnashing its teeth on a cabinet
nominee: Dr. Henry Foster,
Clinton’ s top choice to replace Dr.
Jocelyn Elders as Surgeon Gen-
eral. Foster’s abortion record and
the administration’s lack of prepa-
ration have upset both sides of the
Senate aisle. Last week, Republi-
cans and Democrats alike ex-
pressed frustration with the White
House’s bungled handling of the
Foster nomination; Foster may
become a victim of the administra-
tion which supports him.

Head of Obstetrics and Gyne-
cology at Meharry Medical Col-
lege in Nashville, Foster has prac-
ticed medicine for 38 years. Com-
mended by former President Bush
in 1991, Foster heads a campaign
to end teenage pregnancy through
teaching teens abstinence. Foster
recently served as president of the
Association of Professors of Ob-
stetrics and Gynecology. He
strongly advocates providing more
health care to poor, rural areas.

The controversy that sur-
rounds Foster’s nomination began
when Health and Human Services
sources falsely told Republican
Senator Nancy Kassebaum that
Foster had only performed one
abortion during his career. The

false statement and_ the
administration’s apparent igno-
rance about its own nominee has
enraged even Clinton’s own party.
Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a
Louisiana Democrat, said of
Clinton on Wednesday, “What
people are saying about the Foster
thing is: ‘There he goes again.
Can’ the learn how to run his office
after two years?’”

Attempting to clarify his
record, Foster appeared on ABC’s
“Nightline.” He announced that
he had performed 39 abortions
while in private practice and su-
pervised the clinical trials of an
alternative to surgical abortion
which produced 55 abortions. A
recently discovered 1976 medical
journal article written by Foster
has also worsened his credibility.
In the article; Foster writes that he
performed hysterectomies on se-
verely mentally retarded women
who were not suffering from medi-
cal problems. Many doctors have
defended Foster’ s writings as main-
stream for the time, but the issue’s
obvious controversy has further
deteriorated Foster’s chances.

The White House had origi-
nally planned to abstain from the
abortion issue, but it now appears
as if Clinton has instructed his staff
toconfront the issue head-on. Chief
of Staff Leon Panetta described
Foster’s denouncers as “the ex-

treme right, who are basically say-
ing, ‘We want to make illégal a
woman’s right to choose.’” The
focus on abortion has angered doc-
tors as well as politicians, Dr. Irv-
ing Rust, Director of the Bronx
Planned Parenthood Clinic, said,
“The doctor has delivered thou-
sands of babies, but they’re not
asking him that. They’re asking
him how many abortions he’s
done.” He added, “What we’re
forgetting here is abortions are le-
gal.”
Neither party has embraced
Foster’s nomination; most sena-

tors report they have not yet de- ©

cided how they will vote if Foster
survives the Labor and Human
Services Committee hearing. Al-
though many Republican leaders
have called on Clinton to drop
Foster, Clinton cannot afford sim-
ply to drop another controversial
nominee with his questionable
treatment of Lani Guinier. Clinton
plans to postpone the hearing until
mid-March, ostensibly to give the
FBI time tocomplete a background
check. Most sources believe, how-
ever, that the administration hopes
that during the waiting period, the
current controversy will die down.

issue of Newsweek and the Febru-
ary 10, 13, 15, and 16 issues of The
New York Times.

U.N. Charges

Serbs with
genocide

By GRAHAM ERNST
Dean Rusk adjunct reporter

Last Tuesday, the United Na-
tions tribunal investigating war
crimes in the Balkans indicted
Commander Zeljko Meakic and
20 other Serbian soldiers stationed
at the Omarskaconcentration camp
for.“‘genocide and crimes against
humanity.”

While no exact death toll has
been determined, more than 10,000
Muslims and Croats were impris-
oned at Omarska, aconverted mine
complex, where executions took
place daily between May and Au-
gust 1992.

The charges mark aclear turn-
ing point in the U.N.’s will to re-
place politically safe euphemisms
like “ethnic cleansing” with the
hard truth: genocide. When Brit-
ish newspapers reported that
Omarska was being used as a con-
centration camp in early August
1992, the Bush administration
acted quickly to glaze the situation
over by claiming that none of the
information had been confirmed.

As a signer of the Prevention
of Genocide Treaty, the United
States is legally bound to support a
U.N. military effort to halt such
actions if they are proved to be
occurring. However, prospects of
a costly and entangling military
mission have. forced the Clinton

administration to
follow its predeces-
sor and turn its
shoulder to reports
of war crimes in the
former Yugoslavia.

Genocide is not
exclusive to Bosnia-
Herzegovina today.

and Ingush tradi-
tionalists and civil strife in the
Asian nations of Cambodia and
Burma offer cases of inhumane
actions that most politicians hope
never reach a CNN news camera.
However, at some point the
international community will have
to decide what its role will be in
fighting crimes against humanity.
More than 30,000 women have
been raped in Bosnia, and more
than 1.4 million Croats and Mus-
lims have been forced from their
homes as part of the Bosnian Serb
“ethnic cleansing” campaign.
This question of enforcing the
Genocide Prevention Treaty is
hardly a simple one to answer.
Should the U.S. aggressively in-
vestigate all nations where geno-
cide is suspected and intervene,
risking American lives? Or should
it continue to look the other way
any time an costly military mis-
sion presents itself? The issue is
further complicated in deciding

whether to act alone or to build a
coalition.

The truth of the Nazi concen-
tration camps at Auschwitz and
Dacheau did not present itself until
after WWII was over and more
than six million Jews had been
executed. Even now, Germany’s
version of the Holocaust is unspe-
cific.

Although a generation grew
out of WWII vowing “neveragain”
to allow mass atrocities like the
Holocaust to take place, it is clear
that the vision and clarity of that
“never again” phrase has been
clouded and almost forgotten. If
our vision of the world has changed
since the end of WWII, and we do
value political agendas and opin-
ion polls more than we value hu-
man rights, then admit that this is
the case with honorable regret. Let
us not paint over history by look-
ing the other way to avoid the
truth.

NOTES

Less drinking?

Even though abusive drinking has been the focus of
increased public attention and campus counseling because of
its links with hazing injuries and date rapes, college officials
and health experts who have studied student drinking agree
in several recent studies that the number of college age
drinkers has in fact been declining for two decades.

One in four students reported abstaining even from an
occasional beer in 1971; today it is nearly half, according to
a recent study of more than 300,000 students nationwide by
the University of California at Los Angeles.

The average consumption for those who do drink regu-
larly has dropped to about 13 drinks a week, down from 14.3
in 1982, according to another national study, with much of
the overall decline attributed to light to moderate drinkers,
who now have 6 drinks a week, down from 8.4.

Among the drinkers, however, binge drinking remains
intractable, all the studies suggest, but it is not clear whether
it is rising, declining, or staying the same. There is evidence
that binge:drinking (usually defined as five or more drinks at
One sitting) is up among women.

The main reason for the overall decline in drinking is a
change in attitudes, according to dozens of interviews on
campuses across the nation in the last two weeks.

Today’s freshman have grown up with the tougher drunk
driving laws and 21-year-old legal drinking ages laws en-
acted in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. More are health
conscious and they’re arranging alcohol-fee events on the
weekends.

“Tt’s just an increased awareness that drinking can be-
come something hazardousd not only to your health, but to
your academic life, your studies, your relationships,” said
John Sanchez a junior at New York University.

“Students in the Northeast tend to drink more heavily
than others, but drinking is reported down on campuses large
and small, urban and rural, residential and commuter.

Several states- including Georgia, Massachusettes, Ne-
braska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas-
have passed tougher laws that revoke driver’s licenses of
drinkers who fail or refuse to take an alcohol breath test,
according to the Century Council, a Los Angeles-based non-
profit organization that has campaigned for these stricter
laws.
