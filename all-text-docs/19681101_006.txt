He was a very angry man. ‘

it was a cold, gray day and a few
janitors and maintenance men were
still lingering behind Watts where
they always gather for their lunch
hour. Most of them had feft because
it was about 1:15 but some were emp-
tying trash in the garbage truck
parked by the ROTC Department.

He was wearing one of those gray
jackets that janitors wear with a
sweater underneath it to keep out the
cold. He was angry, shouting violently
at the black man standing on the side
of the garbage truck down below.

“I'm not no janitor, I’m a man.”

You knew how men get mad enough

One of the other janitors smiled and

BOUND IN RED TAPE
Senate Fails

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Maneging Editor

Like John Kennedy during
his first two years in office,
Joe Murphy is on the bad
side of a conservative coali-
tion that entangles him —
with varying degrees of suc-
cess — and manages to limit
the Senate's role.

Of the 12 members of the
Senate, five vote consistently
‘conservative, but three of the
group identify themselves as
the hard-line conservatives:
senior John Passmore and
sophomores Gary Cash and
Ed Dobbs.

Usually joining the coali-
tion are senior Covey Carter
and junior Richard Howard.

The ‘establishment’ with-
in the Senate is liberal, and
nearly always has backing
from President Murphy. Vice
President Peter Hobbie.
sophomore Rich Cowart and
junior Dan Herd.

Senior Frank Murphy, and
junior C. L. Cheshire usually
keep to the middle.

The effect of the conserva.
tive coalition becomes most
evident in the fairly consist-
ent conservative appoint-
ments of the Senate and the
lack of Senate action on new

issues since it was inaugur-
ated last spring.

The conservative coalition
capitalizes on sufficient in-
volvement of other senators
in special projects to pre-
vent any significant effort
in the Senate to pass non-
conservative legislation.

The only really successful
mobilization against the con-
servatives was the vote to
oust freshman regulations, a
move which reduced the
coalition to its three hard-
liners and produced a 9.3
vote.

Of. course, the result of
pending elections is unpredic-

ate will be new when the
group reconvenes Tuesday
night, and half of the 12 new
members will probably be
freshmen.

Sanford: National Government
Needs ‘Young People’s Energy’

The “‘new politics’’ and the
Tole young people can play
in it were described here
Tuesday by the national ex-
ecutive director of Citizens
for Humphrey-Muskie.

Former N. C. Governor
Terry Sanford. who is also

a member of the Davidson
Board of Visitors, told his
chapel audience that the
young possess a ‘‘vital en-
ergy’ which should be used
in government.

He said he would like to
see a young person ‘not long

... Spencer

(Continued From Page 1)

Spencer expressed hope
that the board commissions
could offer a more meaning-
ful definition of Davidson's
“Christian commitment.” He
felt that external aspects of
that commitment should be
de-emphasized. ‘‘Fundamen-
tal to the Christian religion
is a concern for people . . .
and the society in which we
live. This should be the major
focus of Davidson's com-
mitment.”’

In response to the ques-
tion of whether ROTC fit in
with that commitment, Spen-
cer said he saw no “‘particu-
lar conflict there . . . given
the realistic world in which
we live.”

Spencer added that in order
to maintain its Christian
commitment, Davidson must
have a Christian faculty. ‘If
it isn't in the people, where
is it?’ he asked.

He said further that non.
Christians could be hired on
a temporary basis despite
the ‘requirement that faculty
members be _ professing
Christians to qualify for
tenure.

Spencer maintained that
Davidson could have a diver-
sity of ideas without having
a faculty of widely differing
backgrounds. ‘‘For instance,
I don't think you have to
have a Fascist on your fac-
ulty to understand what Hit-
ler was about.”'

the President's cabinet as a
part of a broad effort to put
youthful ideas into govern-
ment.

This young person, Sanford
said,, would be responsible
“for placing additional young

Spencer described the Blue
Sky report as a ‘“‘good be-
ginning.’ but added that
some programs’ were ‘‘not
bold enough.”’ He said that
the foreign study program
should be expanded.

Spencer also called for a
re-evaluation of the number
of cuts allowed, as well as
compulsory assembly.

Spericer predicted that stu-
dents would be given a voice
in future contracts with the
food service, and that re-
novation of dorms would be
high on the list of priorities
in improvements in the phy-
sical plant.

As president of the college,
Spencer said he must “‘go to
every possible source’ for
funds to finance the Blue Sky
proposals, and he urged
students to help ‘“‘make this
a college worth helping.”

mental offices."

“The program I propose
would not only bring young
citizens to Washington but
important government activi.
will also send them where

.ties are taking place in the

50 states and our foreign mis-
sions."

Sanford's speech was the
first of a lecture series spon-
sored by Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon and named in honor of
former President D. Grier
Martin, an SAE. The pur-
pose of the Martin Lectures
will be to bring outstanding
speakers to Davidson.

Martin shared the plat-
form with ‘Sanford. along
with President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr., SAE President
Mike Johnson and SAE mem.
ber Weldon Schenck.

The “new politics,” San-
ford said, could bring “‘new
ideas into the solution of
old problems.

‘The benefit to the country,

I believe, is that talented
young citizens would learn
the problems, experience
the needs, see the defic-
iencies and recognize the op-
portunities of our working

said.

“Besides, without subsidiz-
ed athletics, we'd be losing
many top-notch guys who
make outstanding contribu-
tions to the Davidson com-
munity.”

Concerning social patterns,
Carter came out in support
of the present social struc-
ture including fraternities
but expressed concern for
the non-fraternity men who
might be offered a fuller
social life by the college.
Carter said he had no speci-
fic suggestions on the prob-
lem but. he did say that he

program had not provided
an answer to the problem.

On extra-campus respon.
sibilities, church relationship
and co-education Carter said
he did not know enough
about the questions involved
to express an opinion on each
matter.

When asked if he thought
he had fulfilled the promises
of his platform of last spring
which included a long list
of issues ranging from vol-
untary chapel to the aboli-
tion of the fraternity hous.

ing fee to self-scheduled ex-

ams, Carter at first said that
the 13 issues were not all
on his platform. Assured that
they were, he said the Senate
had not had enough time to
deal with such small issues
while big items were on the
agenda.

Carter said that he hoped
he might be able to provide
the ‘‘effective force’’ to push
such things as unlimited
cuts, open dorms, better off
campus housing and volun-
tary chapel once foot'all

A REVIEW
By JULE YOUNG

“To be successful, each
group must find its own bag:
We're in the midst of devel-
oping ours.”

A ‘commentator speaking
of the problems of the New
Left? Hardly. Rather, he is
Jim Donnery of Donnery and
Rudd, featured at this week's
Hungry d.

This young couple spectal-
izes in a Dylanesque style
appropriately termed ‘“‘urban
folk.’’ Donnery described the
style as ‘‘a synthesis of folk
music and contemporary
lyrics.

“Instead of traditional folk
themes, the lyrics are orient.
ed to the problems of the
city.” However, Donnery
added, ‘‘urban folk is not a
protest-song movement.”

And indeed, most of the
songs used at the d deal ex.
clusively with romantic and
lyrical themes.

Much of the urban em-
phasis was lost in the ebulli-
ent style of those songs con-
taining social comment. For
example, the enthusiasm with
which “Elevator Operator,
Going Down" is presented
overshadows its comment on
the drug scene (“she goes

up so very fast’’).

Well-suited vocally to
rambling, bouncy sounds,
Donnery and Rudd comple-
ment each other on lighter
melodies, periodically tossing
sounds to each other, then
weaving the sounds together
for a synthesis.

The group demonstrated
an inability to communicate
real feeling in some of their
more serious songs. Billed
as an answer to Bob Dylan's
“All Along the Watchtower,”
Donnery and Rudd's “In the
Fields of Mourning’ lacked
not potential but rather a
contagious arrangement.

any omen, near chaos will
soon result.

_For example, the Senate
three weeks ago appointed
two Independents to non.ex-
istent seats on the Social
Council, and Tuesday night
rode roughshod over explicit
constitutional provisions gov-
erning appointments.

So, despite what might
seem to be a change in the
making, little will happen
for several months as the
Senate flounders in its own
red tape—much to the con-
servatives’ delight.

Senate
Doubles

In Size

Elections completed this
week have added 12 mem-
bers to the Senate — six of
them freshmen — and creat-
ed the first joint regulations
court in the school’s history.

Whit Ayres, Jody Turner
and Steve Salyer were elect-
ed to the Senate from the
Freshman. Class at large.
with Salyer receiving the
most votes to become class
president.

Other freshmen elected
were Cecil Burney, Watts:
Lawrence Wilkinson, East;
and Stewart Rogers, Cannon.

Upperclassmen elected to
the Senate by dorms were
Harry Goldman, Richardson;
Floyd Strand, Belk ist and
4th floors: Roger Millis, Belk
2nd floor; Harlan Day, Belk
3rd floor; Frank Wise, Duke:
and Chip Clark, Little.

Clark's election was the
closest, 19-18.

On the Regulations Court,
the seniors elected Stew
Brown, Scott Cutting and
John Williams. Norman Hur-
witz and Stagg Newman were
chosen by the juniors, but
the sophomores have a run-
off today between George
Wagoner and Mike Elliott.

The six freshmen on the
Senate will be the largest
number on the student legis.
lature in recent years. Out
of the 15 members of the
old Student Council, fresh-
men had one member. who
had no vote first semester.

This election also marks
the first time the Senate
has had its maximum mem-
bership of 23.

Peace Recruiters Evicted

For Union Zoning Violation

Students at a peace table
were evicted from the Col-
lege Union lobby Wednesday
morning under threat of
“strong disciplinary action”
by Dean of Students Richard
Cc. Burts Jr.

“IT am officially ordering

you to leave the Union with.
in five minutes,” said Burts.
The group left after confer.

selves.

The peace group had set

from a Marine Corps recruit.

Voters Increase

In Mecklenburg

By NORWOOD POLAND
Statt Writer

Voter registration has
shown a marked increase in
Mecklenburg County as elec-
tion day draws near.

Although the books closed
officially two weeks ago, the
Elections Bureau in Char-
lotte has not yet compiled
final totals because of the
large number of registrants.

As of July this year, there
were 128,857 registered voters
in Mecklenburg, of whom
97.715 were Democrats, 28,701
Republicans, and 2,441 in-
dependents.

“We do estimate a total
of over 143,000 voters when
all reports are in,” a Char-
lotte Elections Bureau work-
er said.

Some of the new registrants
are Negroes, but in July
only 18,000 blacks -were
registered to vote in the.
county. This represents less
than 14 percent of the total,
significantly below the Negro
proportion of the population.

Davidson is located in De-

weese Box Number 1 pre-
cinct, comprising the north-
ern end of the county above
Cornelius. In this precinct
there were 962 voters regis-
tered in July, of whom 829
were Democrats.

Negro registration in De-
weese Box Number 1 is
negligible, the Elections
Bureau reported.

ing table.

After leaving the Union
lobby. the peace group's
table was set up on the porch
of the Union with the con-
sent of Union authorities.

“We feel that if the Marines
are able to recruit for war
and killing, we ought to be
able to recruit for peace,”
said senior Marvin Sparrow,
a member of the group.

“The full facilities of the
Union were available to you
yesterday, tomorrow, the day
after tomorrow,’ Burts told
the group. The dean said
that Union policy permitted
only one group in the Union
lobby at a time.

The eviction was “a ques-
tion of the legality accord.
ing to the zoning laws of the
Union,” said junior John
Reisner, a member of the
group.

APO To Hold Field Day
For 200 Local Children

Alpha Phi Omega will
sponsor a field day this
afternoon for some 200 child-
ren from Davidson Elemen-
tary School.

About 30 student members
of the national service frater-
nity will lead the youngs-
ters in various games and
contests and will treat them
to a weenie roast on the base-
ball field, according to APO
President Tim Bynum.

“Most of the money for the
field day comes from the

Davidson Lions Club," By-
num said.

APO members recently
distributed 2200 copies of the
Davidson College Directory
to students and faculty. The
group sold over $1,000 worth
of advertising in the direc-
tory, Bynum said, and pro.
fits will be used to finance
community projects later in
the year. ‘

“This is the earliest we've
gotten the directory out in
recent years,” Bynum said.
