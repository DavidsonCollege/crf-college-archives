granting of P.E. credit for
participation in intramural

would also support the of-

Psychology of Sport’’ for P.E.
credit.

Baseball Fans Register Protests
For Negligent,Cavalier Treatment

To the Editor:

This is a letter written to
protest the cavalier manner to
wnich Davidson baseball has

been subjected throughout
this current baseball season.

Coverage by THE DAVID-
SONIAN has been inconsistent
and uninformed at best and
downright insulting at its
worst.

A case in point is the April 12
edition of THE DAVID-
SONIAN. The baseball team,
though it had had a rough
season to that point, had just
won two very satisfying
ballgames against Southern
Conferences rivals Furman
and Catawba before dropping
a controversial game to Ap-
palachian State.

The team expected to see
some kind of write-up on the
games, particularly the ex-
citing, extra-inning win over
Furman, in which Davidson
came from behind three
times.

However, the only thing
remotely related to baseball
was a picture of a game which
took place three and a half
weeks before.

Not only THE DAVID-
SONIAN, but the Sports In-
formation department and the
Alumni office have con-
sistently denigrated Davidson
baseball through benign
neglect.

It was six weeks after the
season started before the
team brochures were issued
by the Sports Information
department. Scores of games
are rarely called in by the
department, resulting in little
if any publicity for the team.

Perhaps the most galling in-.
cident of all occurred in the
scheduling for Alumni
Weekend. There has been

/

scheduled an Alumni-Varsity
basketball game. This cannot
fail to lure people away from
going to the baseball team’s
scheduled doubleheader with
Southern Conference opponent
Richmond that same day
(April 20).

Why not schedule an “‘Old-
Timer’s Baseball Game”’ in-
stead? This is baseball season
everywhere else.

For too long, Davidson
baseball has had to remain in
the shadows as far as the
Athletic Department and

Sports Information depart-
ment are concerned.

Davidson may lose baseball
games now and then; but sin-
ce when has overwhelming
success been a pre-requisite
for recognition?

Davidson's baseball players
suffer the same pains as any
other athlete. Should they be
forced to also _ suffer
anonymity?
