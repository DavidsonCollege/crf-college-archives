Gaston supercharges 900 Room dance floor

By JAMES BERRY
Arts & Living Editor

Alas, the comedian expected
for Saturday ‘night sent only his
regards in his place and thus, those
who'd braved the gauntlet of ice
on the way to the 900 Room were
greeted instead by the early, though
not unwelcome, appearance of
Gaston. I soon discovered that

saying the name with a thick and
rather snooty French accent was
entirely the wrong approach when
they were announced as originat-

ing from Gastonia, SC. Accompa-
nying this realization was another
insisting that they weren’t very
creative in the name department.
Moments before powering up
the gear, one of the band members
slid by my group as he made his
way to the stage. One of my friends
could not help but whisper, “look,
awalking disco ball!” Sure enough,
the sequined vest shone with heav-
enly intensity and allowed us only
a short glimpse before we were
forced to turn away in bedazzled
amazement. It’s a wonder per-

formers don’t find that distracting
while they’re on stage. A thousand
flood lights rising from my chest
would only augment the deer-in
the-headlights effect.

Looking out into the surging
crowd of three or four, the
keyboardist made a mostly incom-
prehensible comment alluding to
the number of pretty girls in the
audience as the drums kicked in
and signaled the beginning of “La-
dies Night.” Not having much
listening experience in the R&B
quarter, I’m not sure how much of

the set list was original material.
One of the few songs I did recog-
nize was Prince’s “1999” which
was carried off pretty darn close
the original. At this point the dance
floor was beginning to look
crowded and the performers’ pat-
ter started to sound feasible.
Working from a fairly tradi-
tional palette of instruments in-
cluding guitar, drums (both acous-
tic and electronic), and keyboards
(which doubled as bass), the four
offered a full sound to go along
with their songs. They also mixed

in a trumpet here and there.

The most inspiring part of the
performance was the number of
vocal parts that were used. Each of
the four had a microphone and,
usually while playing an instru-
ment, they were able to kick out
some deadly harmonies or under-
cut one melody with a second.

Rarely do Davidson students
go out of their way to rock to-and-
fro with a band but Saturday night
was the exception. Gaston filled
the dance floor and kept it surging.

Whip up and eat up
“Famous Department
Store Cookies”

By Ros Kosicki & Jay SHULTz
Chefs-in-Residence

This week we decided to pro-
vide y’all with a dessert recipe,
and before break we happened upon
a great one (thanks Dawson). The
recipe, reputed to be worth $250,
was forwarded to me on e-mail
from a friend who will remain
anonymous, as will the famous
department store (with the initials
N. and M.) that has so graciously
provided this delicious concoction.

To make a long story short,
some guy was ripped off by said
department store and decided to
get revenge by putting the recipe
on e-mail. So here it is. You will
need:

2 cups butter

2 cups sugar

5 cups of blended oatmeal
1 tablespoon brown sugar

1 80z Hershey bar (grated)

2 teaspoon of baking powder
2 teaspoon of vanilla

4 cups flour

2 teaspoon baking soda
240z chocolate chips

1 teaspoon salt

4 eggs

3 cups chopped nuts

Cream butter and both sugars.
Add eggs and vanilla. In separate
bowl combine flour, oatmeal, salt,
baking powder and baking soda.
Then combine with mixture of
butter, sugars, eggs and vanilla.
Add chocolate chips, Hershey
shavings, and nuts. Roll into balls
and place two inches apart on non-
stick cookie sheet. Bake for 10
minutes at 375 degrees. Sorry to
those of you who already have this
recipe, and to those who don’t,
enjoy.

Andremember don’t thank us,
thank the poor guy who paid $250
for it.
