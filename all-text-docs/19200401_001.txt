MISS ADELE CROSS
HONORED AS FIELD DAY
QUEEN BY CAPT. MURRAY

The good old days when knights
were brave and chivalrous and when
the fair lady was crowned Queen of
The Tournament by the successful
Knight, were revived on Sprunt
Field last Saturday afternoon.

A large body of fair dames from
Queens College in Charlotte were
present to witness the contest be-
tween Davidson athletes for the hon-
or of selecting the Queen of The
Field Day. The individual winning
the greatest number of points in
the meet was rewarded by this
privilege. :

points, and selected a very pretty
and charming Queen in the person
of Miss Adele Cross, of Queens Col-
lege.

Miss Cross was supposed to
award the. ribbons to the victors,
but due to the late ending of the
meet this feature was omitted.

| The Greater Davidson Club Ban-
‘quet, held in the Alumni Gymnasium
Thursday night, was an epoch-mak-
‘ing event in the career of every Da-
-vidson student, and a few of her
ustrious alumni who returned for
this glorious occasion. Promptly at
7 o'clock the student body filed into
,the gym where scores .of tables
lereaked beneath an appetizing re-
past. After grace had been said by
Dr. J. M. Richards, eating was in
order, and the silence which fell
jover the vast assembly proclaimed
louder than words the enthusiasm of
the men as they went to work.

Mr. Miles was the able toastmas-
ter of the banquet. His remarks in
introducing the several speakers
were witty and in keeping with the
jovial spirit of the occasion. The
first speaker of the evening was Dr.
Archibald Currie. In a few well

sized how the spirit of Davidson
clings to her men who have gone
out. .

“Ifvery one admits Davidson’s
spirit .is superior spirit. It makes
the men who are here and the men
who have gone out like members of
a big family in this world. David-
son spirit is undying loyalty to this
‘old college!” declared Mr. Moore.

A rousing “skyrocket” was given
for Mr. Moore, and then the band
furnished entertainment. Dr. J. M.
‘McConnell was then introduced, and
opened his remarks with:

“I had expected to be over near
Dr. Lingle and Mr. Spence tonight
and be Hooverized.”

Hooverite and McAdooite took up
the challenge and vied with each
other in making himself heard. Then

Carrie and Miley—Heavy Hitting
Features Both Contests

The local baseball season was
ushered in with a rush last week
when the Wildcats took a brace of
games from the Oak Ridge nine. The
scores of the contests were 12 to 5,
and 5 to 4. Both teams put up a
good exhibition of the national past-
time and although many errors were
committeed, heavy hitting featured
the play.

In the opening game Cox for Oak
Ridge, and Currie for Davidson were
the opposing twirlers. The former
pitched a good brand of ball in the
opening innings but the strain be-
gan to tell and in the sixth stanza
the Wildcats got on to his delivery
for a total of four runs. Five more
were added in the eight when the
big southpaw got wild and hit a
couple. This was followed by an
avalanche of hits and poor judge-
ment on the part of his teammates
piled up the victor’s score.
very first inning the prep school lads
got on to Currie’s delivery before the
big boy had gotten warmed up and
before their atack was stemed three
runs had been sent across. “Buck”
settled down then and had the op-
posing batters eating out of his hand
the remainder of the route. The
hitting of Wrenn featured for the
-winners the hefty backstock getting
three singles in five attempts. The
hitting of Morris for the losers stood
out prominent for the Oak Ridge
lads, the outfielder getting two trip-
les in three times at bat.

With Miley in the box in the
second game and his teammates
spotting him four runs in the first
inning, the second game was a Wild-
cat victory from the start. The
local lads batted around on Morris’
delivery in this inning and three hits,
a walk and a hit batsman coupled
with errors on the part of Oak
Ridge, netted them a quartet of runs.
Richardson who replaced Morris on
the mound for Oak Ridge pitched a
fine brand of ball and had the Red
and Black batters puzzled during
the remainder of the game. Only in
the eighth did the locals score and
but for a couple of bonehead plays
would not have done this. The cen-
ter fielder got a single and a triple
out of four attempts.

Bob Miles Resigns as
0 Srey

Has Done a Great Work on the Cam-
pus—Loss Will be Keenly Felt

It was with very great regret that
the students of Davidson learned
that “Bob” Miles, the secretary of
the college “‘Y,” will not be with
us next year.

Mr. Miles has accepted the call to
be assistant pastor to Rev. Charles
yers, of the First Presbyterian
Church, Greensboro, N. C. He will
go to fill this position June 1, im-
mediately after the close of the pres-
ent session.

He is an old Davidson man, having
belonged to the class of 11. He was
popular among his fellow students
while here, and everyone learned to
love him because of his cheery smile
and friendly disposition. After fin-
ishing at Davidson he went to the
Seminary, where he became popu-
lar because of his winning person-
ality. He graduated from the Semi-
nary in 1917.

His work has been a great success
here, he having worked diligently
among us since December, 1918. He
is universally popular, and it was
with great pleasure that we first met
and learned to admire him. Mrs.
Miles is equally popular in the com-
munity, where she has been a leader
in church, social and _ educational
work.

It is with the deepest sorrow that
we give Mr. Miles and his wife up.
But we congratulate him on his new
position and wish him the best of

‘luck. And we sincerely hope that

he will come back to see us often.

Dr. Reed then spread joy with

The pledge was heartily given by
the students, and Dr, Martin gra-
ciously acknowledge it and pledged
himself to the same principles for‘a
better Davidson.

Then after another band number,
Dr, John Peter Monroe, of Char-
lotte, was introduced, and began to
speak on “Athletics.” This noted
Davidson alumnus has long been
connected with and interested in the
athletic side of Davidson’s life, and
on Thursday night he kept his au-
dience in an uproar with tales of his
adventures as a referee when he was
in college here.

“Davidson,” said Dr. Monroe,
puts out the best teams for a col-
lege of its size in the south.”
