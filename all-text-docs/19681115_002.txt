Abolish The Curfew

One of the chief gripes we’ve heard
around campus lately is the continued
existence of the fraternity house cur-
few. This outdated rule restricts
women from the fraternity houses
after midnight on week nights (in-
cluding Friday), 1:30 a.m. on Sunday
morning and somewhat later hours
on dance weekends.

When the Code of Responsibilitv
was adopted in October, this rule and
the other faculty regulations “not in
conflict with the Code” were adopted
as a temporary set of administrative
rules, until a permanent set could be
drawn up by the student life division
of the administration. Since then the
question of the curfew has been dis-
cussed rather unproductively by the
interfraternity Council.

Because the administrative officers
are in the process of drawing up the
permanent administrative rules. we
feel that now would be an excellent
time to abolish the curfew rule en-
tirely. We base our argument chiefly
on the principle involved. We feel that
the.rule is clearly in conflict with the
code, which assumes social maturity
on the part of the students.

The moral implications of the rule

are not very nice either. Although
administrative officers usually hedge
on this point, the rule clearly exists
in part to prevent some immoral act
by a Davidson student in the wee
hours of the morning.

In the first place this argument
illustrates the paternalistic attitude
which the college has held toward
students for so long.and. which the
code was trying to eliminate. In the
second place, the pragmatic aspects
of the argument would indicate that
such acts would rarely happen in
fraternity houses.

It is time the college stopped trying
to impose a moral code on its students.
It is very inconsistent for the college
to allow almost complete liberty in
most areas and not to allow the simple
privilege of entertaining women guests
in one’s fraternity house at one’s own
discretion.

If the college is worried about its
‘reputation, it has certainly exaggerat-
ed the importance of this rule in main-
taining it. We just hope the adminis-
tration will concur with us in this
opinion and deposit this rule in File

ROTC °Compromise’

You can cite advantage after advan-
tage of having ROTC at Davidson, and
we’ll probably agree with most of what
you say. But please don’t give us that
line about ROTC being non-compul-
sory now.

Don’t kid yourself. ROTC is still
very compulsory.

Any freshman who wants and who
can get both his parents to agree to
it before he leaves home, of course,
can get out of the program. That was
the deal the trustees worked out last
spring in a half-hearted effort to
pacify the Blue Sky Committee and
the faculty, both of whom had recom-
mended a voluntary program.

Most trustees still favor a required
program, and they said so last spring.
They therefore made darn sure it
Stayed that way.

The so-called “compromise” they

drew up is really no compromise at all.
It was in effect here some years ago,
according to Trustee Chairman Lingle,
and it hardly put a dent in the number
enrolled in basic. ROTC. Therefore it
didn’t bother the trustees to re-insti-
tute it. .
’ Only seven freshmen this year used
their option to get out of basic ROTC,
and we'll bet there are some trustees
surprised there were that many. Under
the present set-up, it’s not likely that
any more than that will get out. A
couple of letters and a few pages in
the Wildcat Handbook, buried in that
deluge of August mail to incoming
freshmen, can’t be very convincing.

The trustees have once again genu-
flected before the holy see of tradi-

on.

Bob Scott’s Debt

If Bob Scott and the rest of the
state’s Democrats would stop sighing
in relief long enough, they might look
again at that narrow victory they
eked out last week in the guberna-
torial race.

As everybody knows, the race was.
the closest in recent state history,
for Républican Jim Gardner came
within a whisker of winning it.

That it was so close is not really
surprising—most prognosticators had
it figured thus—and the way Scott
got his victory isn’t too surprising
either. Only tragically ironic.

Perhaps more than anv other fac-
tor, the Negro vote put Bob Scott in
the governor’s mansion—the same
Bob Scott who spent most of the cam-
paign acting as though he didn’t give
a hang about the blacks’ support.

This is the way Democrats in this
state have played it for years now. In
the first place, the Negro vote has
never been that important to them,
but on the -few occasions when it has
been, the Tar Heel Democrats have
been able to use the national party’s
accomplishments to get it. Consequent-
ly, they have never felt obliged to pay

off any political debts of gratitude,
and the Negro in North Carolina has
continued to rock along, riveted for
the most part to the slot of second-
class citizenship.

Occasionally a Democrat like Terry
Sanford comes along with at least a
tacit promise for change, but Sanford
backed down from the test of Sen.
Sam Ervin, citing fear of a racial hate
campaign. And if Reginald Hawkins
is any kind of indication, the state's
Negroes are hurting for leaders
among ‘themselves.

Just maybe Bob Scott will be the
man to help the Negro, despite the
way he ran his campaign. Before this
fall, he had been pegged as a racial
moderate with a measure of concern
for North Carolina's jblack people,
and undoubtedly many Negroes were
remembering this when they voted
for him.

Scott, unlike any North Carolina
governor in history, owes something
to the Negro community for its votes.
That much is undeniable. But it is far
more than a debt of gratitude that
Scott and the Democrats owe the
Negro.

Campus Melodrama

If it’s a little hypertension you
want, may we recommend the melo-
drama acted out by the peace pro-
testors and the administration over
the last couple of weeks?

The whole affair simply got way
out of hand, and one side is just as
gitltv as the other.

The administration is guilty of over-
reacting. Judging by their behavior at
least, two or three administrators ap-
parently feared some kind of image-
damaging disruption on the part of
the so-called “radical” students.

.But the kind of violent student
radicalism they fear is simply not at
Davidson, as any one of the veace
protestors will tell you. Their aim in
protesting armed forces recruiters
was not disruption, just a presenta-
tion of alternatives. And they tried to
make this clear.

By the same token, the protestors
are guilty of over-reaction, too. The
picture they somehow conjure up of
a hostile, inflexible, mired-in the-
status-quo administration is naive, to
sav the least. and the reaction of sev-
eral to President Spencer’s stand on
dissent was pretty juvenile.

Hopefully, both sides will see the
real intentions of the other more
clearly as the crisis subsides. In the
meantime, we conveniently divest
ourselves of the responsibility of pro-
posing a solution and merely counsel:
cool it, guys.

Praises

Ellison

To The Editor: ;

In response to the lead edi-
torial of the Nov. 1 issue of
THE DAVIDSONIAN, 1
should like to say two or
three things.

The formal lecture ‘is only
one part of the work of a
Reynolds Lecturer. While
you may speak of Ralph Elli
son's “pitiful performance in
chapel," you fail to acknow-
ledge that Mr. Ellison made
a number of other perfor.
mances, all of which to my
thinking were brilliant. His
reading from his new novel
on Wednesday night was
warmly appreciated by his
eudience, and his handling
of deep and complex issues
during the coffee hour on
Thursday after the chapel
talk was extraordinary.

In the five years that I
have been at Davidson I have
not met a wisitor who handl-
ed questions and answers’
with so much grace, patience
and sensitivity. In other
words, I think your editorial
implied that .Mr. Ellison's
visit was a failure, and that
the committee made a mis.
take in inviting him.

I would respond that those
who met Mr. Ellison and
heard him at times other
than his chapel talk were
deeply impressed with him
as a human being, and thank-
ful for his presence here.

Leaving Southern
Is “Absurd” - Boyd

To The Editor:

I would like to make a few
comments about Russ Mer-
ritt's article in the November
8 edition of THE DAVIDSON.
1AN. Davidson's football
team currently ranks better
than Furman and VMI, and
certainly would be capable
of giving any team in the
Southern Conference a good
game. Next year's team
should be improved.

Our tennis, soccer and golf
teams have all been success-
ful in the Southern and bene-
{it from good competition and
the goal of a conference
championship. Admittedly

Hamil Criticizes
Fogleman, Team

To The Editor:

Why did Davidson's soccer
team lose to The Citadel?
Coach Fogleman blamed
the loss only on the team. In
THE DAVIDSONIAN of Nov-
ember 8, he was quoted as
saying, “The players can't
party all night and expect
to play their best the next
morning. We: played like we
were dead.”

“It is interesting to note that
Fogleman's authority was
the fact that two players
came up to him after the
game and apologized for not
playing better because they
were out late the night be-
fore. Froia this Fogleman
decided that everyone was
out partying.

classed, but they still get the
benefits of a conference meet
and scheduling ease. _

In basketball, although we
do have to play 10 Rich
monds, Furmans and East
Carolinas, we still get 14
games versus top-flight com-
petition, and receive a vir-
tual automatic bid -to the
NCAA playoffs.

If Davidson should drop
out of the conference, foot-
ball would become a minor
sport here (keep in mind
that we beat Wofford 30-7
last year) and our minor
sports would be deprived of
conference competition and
championships. ,

Although basketball might
become more lucrative fin-
ancially, our record would
not be improved by playing
more teams like Duke and
fewer like The Citadel, and
competition among indepen-

clusion just won't hold water.
As for myself, I'd rather be
3.6 in the Southern than 8]

Olson:
Drink
Abuse?

To The Editor: -

I personally think that
drinking on campus has been
needed for a long time for
a varicty of reasons, none of
which have bcen expressed
before. However, now that on
campus drinking is a reality
I believe that too many stu.
dents are abusing their new
freedom.

I'm not knocking those stu.
dents who see the value of
alcohol as a means to escape
from reality into a world of
ublivious stupor, but I do feel
that they should show some
responsibility in the disposal
of their empty beer cans and
whiskey bottles.

After last weekend I was
disappointed in those who
littered the campus and the
town with the empty contain
ers of their spirit friends.
This is a small point, but it
needs correcting.

Soccer 1968 says, ‘His (Fog-
leman's) basic philosophy of
soccer is conditioning."

However, in the four years
I have been at Davidson, the
soccer team has never been
in shape. In fact the most
conditioning in any one prac-
tice has been 15 minutes and
that was spread over a two
hour practice. Lefty’s boys
wouldn't mind conditioning
if that were ail that it took.

Why did Davidson lose to
The Citadel?

Fogleman is a_ tennis
coach, not a soccer coach.
He is a good administrator,
but he knows practically
nothing about soccer. If a
boy doesn't know how to
play good soccer when he
comes to Davidson, he cer-
tainly won't learn here.

Soccer is a game of fund-
amentals — shooting, pass-
ing. heading, dribbling and
trapping — but our team
never practices them. It is
like a football team that
never practices tackling or a
baseball team that doesn't
have batting practice. All the
team does is strimmage.

Why did Davidson lose to
The Citadel?

Hite On ROTC;
Open The Gym?

To The Editor:

Last week I noticed that
THE DAVIDSONIAN, in
keeping with its unquestion-
able sense of priorities, gave
the headlines once again to
the ROTC question.

Two questions have always
bothered me about ROTC ob-
jections. Why do the same
trolls always raise the fuss,
and why does THE DAVID-
SONIAN always give them
the front page? It seems that
the decrease of reasons for
objection to ROTC is inverse-
ly proportional td the size of
THE DAVIDSONIAN’s head.
lines which advertise for
the objectors.

It might interest the Sen-
ate to know that there no
longer is any compulsory
ROTC. All that is required
to get out is a note from
home not really different
from the excused absences
that one’s parents had to
write in high school.

Now for my real beef. Why
are the objectors intent on
destroying a voluntary pro-
gram which, in itself, is the
main reason that most of the
graduating seniors are able
to be deferred to graduate
school? Why do the objectors
want to send every non.
conscientious objector over
to Vietnam as a private to
wade around in’ the rice
fields?

The way the program
stands now seems quite ac-
ceptable. With a note from

home you are out. It hurts
very little to march around
for an hour a week and make
fun of the sergeants. It's
keeping boys in school; it's
sending them to graduate
school.

This country demands the
body of every man: ROTC
may give them this body for
a couple of years, but in do-
ing so allows men to stay in
school and develop their
minds in any way they want.
It would be refreshing to see
objectors developing theirs’.

To The Editor:

Last Wednesday two other
members of STEP and my-
self were not permitted to
allow our tutees to play
basketball in the gym, which
was deserted at the time. We
were told the ‘'no outsiders
are permitted to use the
gym.":

I think that a college that
will not let a campus organ-
ization like STEP use gym
facilities is being a bit arbi-
trary and short-sighted. I
would think that a high
school basketball prospect
would be allowed to try out
the gym: I don’t see why
this privilege should be de
nied to guests of Davidson
students.

carry a long way at night.

But in 1958 .the chapters moved to Patterson
Court, where they remain a long way from sleepy
townspeople. But the curfew is still there.

Then, as we all know, the college began trusting
students (or at least acknowledging that they couldn't
control them) and the era of student responsibility be-
gan. As a result students can drink in their rooms, but
they cannot date in their houses after a certain hour.

Since there are no neighbors to complain about
noise, the principal reason for the curfews must be
one of morals. Bluntly, some people in the administra-
tion must be afraid there will be sex in the basements
of Patterson Court if the regulation is abolished.

Admittedly, the possibility of sex exists. Accord-
ing to a reliable source, a fraternity housemother dis-
covered such a situation several years ago. But for
that matter there will probably be gross infractions of
the drinking rule before Davidson goes out of business.

The question of violations is irrelevant in this

case. The curfews are against the spirit of student
responsibility. It is obvious to most people that it is
inconsistent to trust young men with alcohol and the
Honor Code and not with matters of personal morality.

_ In a day when the notion of in loco parentis is
going out of style, I do not understand why the college
maintains a paternalistic attitude on this matter.

_, One of the arguments for lifting the ban on campus
drinking was that students could get soused a few
miles from school anytime they wished. The same holds
true here. And most Davidson gentlemen would rather
spend the night in a soft bed at Tabor’s Inn than on
an aging couch in their basement. And at Tabor's

eople wouldn't have_to worry_about-a-security guard
interrupting an evening. Of course the problem of sex
is deeper than that, and a solution involves more prob-

ing.

s @ €@

Don’t expect Dr. Spencer’s commissions to announce
any startling proposals in the next few months. If they

do they didn’t do their jobs.
As everyone knows, th

@ problems to be tackled

by the commission can’t be grasped quickly. For in-
stance I wonder how the commission. on social life
can reach any conclusions until its counterpart on co-

education finishes its work.

Opening the college to women might drastically
affect patterns of social life at Davidson.

Coeducation might also alter the pattern for Da-
vidson’s future development. Money which might have
gone to raising salaries, building laboratories or buy-
ing books would have to be used to construct new dor-
mitories, hire a dean of women and renovate the gym
to accommodate girls’ physical education classes.

But. if Davidson increased the student body, it
would need new classrooms, laboratories and a dozen

other facilities.

In formulating its proposals the commission will
have to study these questions and determine answers
for them. The problem might boil down to a question
of whether or not Davidson is willing to suspend much
of its development in order to admit women.

The commission dealing with the role of the
church probably has the most ticklish assignment. For
one thing it may be hard for them to gather evidence.
____ The relationship of Davidson and the Presbyter-
ians is not something that can be measured by statis-
tics. True, Davidson receives little money from the
Church. But how many people contribute to the school
because of its religious affiliation? ;

_ In a sense Davidson might be called a closed edu-
cational system. These alumni came here in the days
when the Church played a major role in student life.

If that role were further diminished, would these

alumni desert the fold, and as a result, cost Davidson
its principal source of students? Could the college af-

ford this temporary loss?
Good Luck. id
