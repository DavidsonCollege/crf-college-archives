Kruse’s Cubby

I hate the
Panthers.

By MICHAEL KRUSE
Sports Editor

I had this Cubby all planned
out.

The 49ers were going to rav-
age the Panthers, and rape, pil-
lage, and plunder brand spanking
new Ericsson Stadium.

And I was going to sound
off.

I was going to tell the naive
and annoying Panthers fans to
shut up and sit down because
their team was nothing but a bunch
of visionary expansion
wannabees.

I was going to tell them not
to even compare their team to the
49ers, perennial NFC West kings.
I was going to tell the Ob-
server to shove its excessively
positive Panthers coverage up its
you know what. Because you
know, there’s more to the sports
world than the Panthers.

And I was going to rant and
rave about how the Panthers-49ers
so-called blockbuster was far
from the Game of the Century.
Sure, to the Panthers, yes, it
may indeed have been the Game
of the Century. But to the 49ers,
it was just another blip ‘on the
screen of conference domination.
But because of Carolina’s
stunning 23-7 victory, lam forced
to retreat.

I must admit. The Panthers
were rather impressive. Beating
Them of the Handful of Super
Bowl Rings is no small feat.

But I still hate the Panthers.
And even.-with the win over
the 49ers, 3-0 does not mean the
Panthers are on a crash course
with Super Bowl. destiny. Or
even headed to the playoffs. _
Even if the Panthers Times -
excuse me, the Observer - says
so.

Dammit, you people, get
cynical.

You see, 1am from Boston,
the cynicism capital of the world.

Home of the Red Sox, who
haven’t won a World Series since
1918, who were one out away in
1986 for batter after batter, who
were one strike away...

AndI’m not bitter. Just cyni-
cal.

The Panthers aren’t going to
win the Super Bowl in their sec-
ond season. Get that through
your heads.

In Boston, if the Patriots start
3-0 (and we usually don’t have to
worry about that), the media
doesn’t jump on the bandwagon
like it has here in the Queen City.

No sir. It wonders how this
freak of nature ever happened
and then reasons about when and
how the Pats will collapse. When
Bledsoe will fold. When Parcells
will gain that fatal pound.

Men’s soccer struggles as it
prepares for big dogs
Wildcats fall to App. St., slip by VMI

By DanieL Motz

What was supposed to be an
easy week for the men’s soccer
team nearly turned disastrous, as
the Wildcats fell to App. St., 1-0,
on Wednesday and-escaped with a
2-1 victory over VMI on Saturday.

Coming off a2-0loss at UNLV
two weekends ago where the Wild-
cats outshot the Runnin’ Rebels,

18-9, Davidson hoped to use the
Southern Conference foes as astep-
ping stone to the difficult portion
of its schedule.

But App. St. had other ideas.
Taking advantage of their Astroturf
surface, the Mountaineers played
a more up-tempo game than the
Wildcats had been used to. Keep-
ing the ball on the Davidson half of
the field for the majority of the
game, App. St. was finally able to
convert in the 86th minute for the
game-winning goal.

“App. St. played very, very
well,” coach Charlie Slagle said.
“They played well defensively and
were able to convert offensively,
and the one was all they needed.”

Slagle'also noted the home-

field prowess of App. St., citing
the Mountaineer victory over
Southern Conference power
Furman a year ago. But he also
mentioned Davidson’s lack of
preparation.

“On the road, we have to learn
to swallow our pride and play to
the conditions,” Slagle explained.
“The Astroturf was obviously an
advantage forthem. Butasateam,
we have to go out and adjust. We
just didn’t do that.” —

Perhaps searching for a spark,
Slagle shook up the starting line-
up Saturday, benching senior for-
wards Coley Dominiak and Rob-
ert Clarke in favor for Bryce Jewett
and Wes Roache. Slagle also gave
sophomore midfielder Drew
Lindsey the starting nod.

“T have been playing like (dog
doo),” Clarke reasoned. “I deserved
to.be benched.”

Davidson came out firing, but
was unable to convert. And fifteen
minutes into the game, it was VMI
taking a 1-O advantage ona goal by
Phillip Harper. The Wildcats con-
tinued to have a plethora of oppor-

tunities. and, despite outshooting
the Keydets, 9-5, VMI took the
one-goal lead into the lockerroom.
With 31:07 left in the game,
Phil Julien broke free and whipped
ashot past Keydet goalkeeper Tom
Butler to even the game.
Davidson continued to domi-
nate, but the game remained dead-
locked until Robert Clarke punched
in a deflected Dennis Buck shot
with 28 seconds left, giving the
Wildcats the 2-1 squeaker.
Davidson (6-3) was pleased
with the comeback win, but main-

tains their best soccer is yet to
come.

“It showed good character to
come back,” Clarke said. “But as
whole, I still don’t think we’re
playing well.” ;

Slagle also credited an im-
proved Keydet club.

“VMI showed that they really
have improved their talent over the
past few years,” he said. “We’re
still in a period of transition, but to
our credit, we came back and
fought. This team doesn’t give

up.

And let’s hope not: A home
loss against VMI would have im-
pounded an already dented ‘96
campaign. To prevent the whis-
pers of being apathetic under-
achievers, the Wildcats must step
up in the next couple of weeks, as
they face three top 25 powers in
UNC Greensboro, George Mason,
and Duke, and perennial Division
II force Florida Institute of Tech-
nology.

“This team is ready to play,”
Slagle said. “We know its time to
pick it up.”

Women harriers
run to third

By JONATHAN HAYES
Staff Writer

The women’s cross country
team faced Western Carolina and
App. St. on Saturday on a chal-
lenging course in Cullowhee, N.C.

Although Debra Williams,
Elizabeth Fischer, and Jennie Clark

’ bettered their times, the squad was

disappointed with its overall per-
formance and hopes that a return
of some of its injured to next

weekend’s roster will help.

As Suzy Burr, yesterday’s top
finisher, said, “I think it (next
week’s race) will be a lot better
because we will have a lot of the
people back.”

The team is now familiar with
the rough nature of the course in
Cullowhee, site of this year’s con-
ference meet and hopes to use that
increased knowledge in the No-
vember championships. |

Volleyball breaks
losing streak

By Drew WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

The Wildcats ended a nine-
game losing streak this week with
decisive victories over Winthrop
on Tuesday and N.C. A&T on Sat-
urday.

The Wildcats (4-9) had been
plagued with a “lack of finishing,”
but seemed to correct the problem.

“We came up on some tough

situations this time and we pushed
forward,” said head coach Lisa
Radford after the Winthrop vic-

‘tory. “I’m pleased that we finally

finished.”

Davidson swept Winthrop in
three games, 15-9, 15-7, 16-14.
L.A. Bumgarneragain led the team
in kills and digs, and Radford
praised the blocking efforts of Jamil
Sawyer and Janet Duncan, who
combined for 8 blocks on the
evening,

Davidson needed four games
to dispatch A&T, recording a 15-
13, 5-15, 15-13, 15-12 victory.
