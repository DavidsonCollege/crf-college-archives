WALT taking college radio to next level

Where independent and mainstream meet to
battle it out over the airwaves of Davidson

By JENNIFER MILLER
Staff Writer

Every day, WALT wages war on
mainstream culture with hard-to-find
new music, no dirty words, and the best
taste on AM radio. WALT is entirely
student run.

For WALT, every day is a Satur-
day: it starts at noon and plays late into
the night, usually until about 2
WALT sports specialty shows ranging
from Jazz to Chick-rock-according-to-
Sarah Hankins.

More than student radio, WALT is
college radio, the latest forum for alter-
native music. Music that critics once
called underground is now targeted at
college radio stations.

Promoters, record labels, and
bands send WALT about 10 to 15 new
CDs a week which all go through the
ears of Doug Meislahn, the music direc-
tor.

Meislahn compiles a rotation bin
of the promos and charts and decides

how often each one is played ina month.
Like other college radio stations across
the country, WALT sends this list to the
College Music Journal.

For many new bands, college ra-
dio is the proving ground, and record
labels are interested in student response.
WALT is significant as the only re-
porter to the CMJ in the Charlotte area.

WALT introduces new bands that
have either found no place on the main-
stream FM dial or groups that want to
target a more select audience.

WALT is also the only source of
hard-to-find tour information of bands
like Yo la Tengo, the Blue Rag, and the
Squirrel Nut Zippers.

Bands from REM to Beck have
made their premiers on college radio.
Listening to WALT continues a tradi-
tion of the college scene, and gives a

first crack at what could one day be the ©

next Superchunk. (“Man, like, I used to

listen to them on College Radio.”’)
WALT has no set forum, except

the unspoken avoidance of top 40 songs.

Its 91 disc jockeys have full creative
range as long as they avoid dirty words
and bad taste. °

Always open to suggestions, the
DJs take requests. If this sounds
appealing, some morning spots are
still open. (Call Jennifer Simmons
for DJ information.)

WALT hopes to start playing
at the Union at night, and wants to
expand its accurate reporting of fresh
music. (Matt,Staton wants the senior
class gift to be an FM antenna.)

As on the music scene, stagna-
tion is death. Student participation in
WALT has been on the rise since its
revival in the spring of 1995 from a
six-year hiatus.

Its hands-on experience with
equipment and mass communication. .
is hard to find elsewhere.

You only need open ears and an
AM antenna to join the fun.

ON SOUTH BRO AD

‘Virgo (August 23- September 22) — Ah, vestal virgos. This week, you

Libra (September 23- October 22) — An army of homunculi (riding on
eohippi— who knew?) lays seige to the Union. Actually, they’ re first-
year-students. Be careful, these little men have a bee in their collective
bonnet. Lucky Place: Davidson’s own Champs de Mars: Richardson
field.

Scorpio (October 23- November 21) — Mother Nature, Father Time, and
Old Men River and Winter converge upon you in a bevy of activity this
week. Fight the elements with an old fashioned roundelay.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) — You've got two turntables
(or lazy susans) and a microphone. And you thought that you were alone
in the world.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19) — Avoid Lake Norman, as a
flotilla of FCA-ers has been sighted in the area. These latter-day argo-
nauts are out to hang you by a yardarm. Sinners in the hands of an angry
god.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)— Canvass campus for all flags that
are un-illuminated. Couch them in heavenly mandorlas, or just steal
them. Are you ridiculous? Yes, yes you are.

Lucky Logic: false and/or skewed. Lucky Code: Honor.

Pisces (February 1 9-March 20) — People in the commons “literally walk
on water.” Wow, did you know that? Pulper fiction if I have ever heard
it. Lucky Place: Bethsaida.

Aries (March 21-April 19) —Young parvenus in your classes? Typique.
Tell those people in your cunniloquium to cool it now. Ooh watch out.
They’re going to lose control.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) — Toys of yore are a leitmotif this week.
Think of the ones with really utilitarian names like Baby Alive™ or
Simon™. Invoke the spirit of Xavier Roberts, but avoid that creepy thing
that made him sign his name on butts.

Gemini (May 21-June 20) — Esoteric, formulaic and often incompre-
hensible speech about the occult is no way to make friends, at least not
at Davy College. Un/lucky hocus pocus: channeling Polly Griffin and/or
pretending that Tom Shandley’s house is the temple of your familiar.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)— As usual for you, Cancer, life is so great that
you almost cannot sustain yourself. This week, your thesis writes itself,
your professors cancel class and members of your preferred sex fall at
your feet. Why? Because you are amazing.

Leo (July 23-August 22)— The putrescence of Patterson Court is
pervasive. Does “sorority” mean “identity subverter” or “stupid” in
Greek? Take your pick.

dream the impossible dream, whatever that may be. Lucky place:
Chambers dungeon.
