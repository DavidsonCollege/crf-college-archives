A Lunar New Year

Bianca MITCHELL
Staff Writer

Food, fun and fireworks lit up
the spirits of at least a hundred
people of the Davidson community
during this Sunday’s Lunar New
Year celebration held in the Alvarez
College Union. The events, which
were sponsored by the Davidson
College Asian Cultural Awareness
Association, drew members from
all over the community, bringing
many cultures together to celebrate
the holiday.

Kevin Green works at the Da-
vidson Community School and has
attended the events for the past four
years with his wife and daughter. “I
love to see the Asian community
come together. I have a Chinese
daughter so it’s always good for her
to be able to celebrate and also see
similar faces.”

The Lunar New Year, which is

also referred to as Chinese New
Year or Spring Festival, is the most
important of the traditional Asian
holidays. The festival begins on the
first day of the first lunar month on
the Asian lunar calendar, and ends
on the fifteenth day. ACAA secre-
tary, Pallavi Penumetcha ’11, loves
being involved in the club’s biggest
event of the year. “We really try and
incorporate many different aspects
of Asian culture,” she said.

Each year of the calendar is
represented by an animal, and 2009
is the year of the ox. Red is the tra-
ditional color of the celebration,
as it is believed to steer away bad
fortune and evil spirits that could
come in the New Year.

Sunday’s celebration included
many of the traditional Lunar New
Year elements. The night started off
at five o’clock with a free meal in

Students visit D.C. for inaugural pilgrimage

On January 20", 2009 members
of the Davidson community joined
more than 2 million people in front
of Capitol Hill to watch Barack
Obama take the oath of office and
assume the presidency of the Unit-
ed States of America. Summoned
by a sense of history and the “hope
for change” that marked the Presi-
dent’s campaign, the crowd was
one of the largest ever to gather for
the occasion.

The day began early for those
wishing to attend. The mass of peo-
ple heading to the mall clogged the
Metro system, making it challeng-
ing to move around the city. Due
to security measures, all the bridges
around the city were closed to traf-
fic and waiting lines to get onto
the Mall could be as long as 4 or
5 blocks.

Even at 8:00 am, hours before
the ceremony, visitors were already
incredibly exhausted, cold and
overwhelmed.

Nonetheless, excitement im-
bued the nation’s capital. For many

people, including Davidson Col-
lege’s own President Tom Ross, it
was the first presidential inaugu-
ration they had ever attended. “It
was a very cold day,” President
Ross said, “but very historic, very
rewarding. The history of it made
you happy to be there.”

“Tt always reminds me of the
real strength of our democracy,”
President Ross added, “that we
can transfer power in such a peace-
ful manner. It’s very rare in the
world.”

The composition of the crowds
reflected this same democratic
sentiment. The smiles and tears
Obama evoked during his 18-min-
ute long speech belonged to a col-
orful, multi-ethnic, multilingual,
bipartisan audience of all ages.
“An amazing number of young
people and African Americans
were around me,” Political Science
Professor Russell Crandall said, “it
was great.”

Amidst all the celebration,
however, there were some frustra-
tions. Despite holding tickets to en-
ter the secured area in front of the

that the students will really enjoy
it,” Union Board Concert Commit-
tee Chair Michael Mellody ’11 said
of the event.

the general public. On Wednesday
morning at nine thirty, students will
have the exciting opportunity to at-
tend a special ticket-release party
in the Alvarez College Union.

At the party, students will be
able to purchase tickets, as well as
enter their names into a raffle for a
chance to win special VIP tickets to
the show. Those lucky VIP ticket
holders will get their choice of seat-
ing, as well as the chance to meet
the bands before the show. Tickets
will go on sale to the general public
sometime in the following week.
This eagerly anticipated event will
be held April 9" in the College’s
Baker Sports Complex.
