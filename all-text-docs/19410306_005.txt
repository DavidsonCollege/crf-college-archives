a news analyst stated
radio that he thought the
United States was facing the big-
that it had in
its history, in the Lend-Lease Bill.

Every one does not hold the same

»pinion, but we know there is some
feeling among the’ students on this
subject, especially since we in the
past have been supporting a move-
ment to give aid to the British.

So we offer this question to the
students: Do you think that this
would be a wise move on the part
of the United States to give aid to
sritain in the form of this new bill?
Have you any opinion as to how it
would affect us as students?

Lawson Withers—Senior. To pro-
tect ourselves is the selfish motive
behind all our idealistic efforts to
aid Britain. Britain is stopping. Hit-
ler for a time. Accepting this —in-
terpretation, [ am for all aid possible
to Britain short of men.. However,
it would be chaotic to convoy sup-
ply ships with our navy. After all,
we want to protect ourselves from
war, and under modern interpreta-
tions of international law, Hitler
would have the right to sink any
American ship attempting to bring
supplies through the U-boat bloc-
kade.

Ed Scott—Junior. With the world

in its present stage of turmoil and
war, it seems to me that upon the
passage of the Lease-Lend bill stand

CLUB INITIATES

Davidson's first year football

Hector MacLean, Senior. Though

the question of whether or not the
United States is going to war can-
not be answered, the Lease-Lend
Bill is favorable in either event. To
defeat Germany, Britain needs the
help which we could give her

that this bill provides what might
be termed dictatorial powers to the
President but at the same time it
