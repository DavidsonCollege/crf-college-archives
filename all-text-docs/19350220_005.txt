THE DAVIDSONIAN,

FEBRUARY 20,

1935

PROF, CURRIE 19
RADIO SPEAKER

Band, Vocal Quartet, and Organ
Are Also Presented On
Weekly Program

A talk by Professor Archie Currie on
“Problems of Post-Graduate Study” was
the main feature of Davidson’s weekly
radio program last Friday night.

The program began promptly at nine,
“Philip’s Delicious Soup Time,” to the
strains of the theme song “O, Davidson,”
as rendered by the band.

Another high spot on the program was
“Rule, Brittannia,” the national anthem
of Great Britain and Ireland, which was
presented as the second of a series of
national anthems. ‘Le Marsellaise” was
played last week.

Professor Currie’s talk, lasting eight
minutes, was especially concerned with
the post-graduate problems of a strug-
gling young lawyer. He dealt with con-
ditions of the legal profession from the
young lawyer’s point. of view.

Other band selections on the program
were “Americans, We,” by Henry Fil-
more, and “Them Bases,” a solo for bari-
tones, trombones, and bass horns, accom-
panied by the band. The college quartet
presented “Fairest Lord Jesus,” a Silesian
folk song. An organ solo by Professor
Pfohl completed the program.

At nine-thirty, to the familiar words:
“Your announcer, Gordon Brown,” Da-
vidson College went off the air.

TRUSTEES ON DANCING IN 1931

Inasmuch as the ruling of the Trus-
tees of the college in reference to danc-
ing is under discussion, we feel that it
is well for us to know precisely what
the ruling is. We are, therefore, print-
ing the action of the Trustees as copied
from their official minutes.

We take the following from the min-
utes of the meeting of the Trustees on
February 18, 1931:

“C, H. Goodykoontz, President of the
Student Body; Dan LaFar, President of
the Senior Class, and Dean Rusk, Presi-
dent of the Y. M. C. A,, presented to
the Board a petition in which they asked
that the student body be allowed to hold
dances at the college. After hearing
the committee, the Board went ino ex-
ecutive session, and after considerable
discussion the following committee was
appointed, upon motion, to nominate a
committee whose duty shall be to study
the whole question and report to the
June meeting of the Board: R. H. Mc-
Caslin, W. S. Royster and A. R. Mc-
Queen.

“The following committee was nomi-
nated and the nominations were adopted :
I. P. Graham, chairman, J. A. Cannon,
W. C. Brown, J. P. Matheson and C. E.
Hodgin.”

We take the following from the min-
utes of the Trustees on June 2, 1931:

“The special committee appointed at
the February meeting of the Board to
study the question of granting the peti-
tion of the students of the college as to
allowing dances on the campus made a
report through its chairman, I. P. Gra-

ham, and the same was adopted as read:
“I, First of all; we recommend that

the following reply be made to the stu-
dents :

“‘The Trustees of Davidson College
wish to say to the students that after
having given full and respectful consid-
eration to their request they feel com-
pelled to decline it. Davidson College
was founded by the Presbyterian Church
and is now controlled by fifteen Pres-
byteries of that Church. The General
Assembly, which is the highest Court of
the Presbyterian Church, has from time
to time made deliverances calling upon
its members to refrain from dancing. A
number of the controlling Presbyteries
have expressed themselves as emphati-
cally opposed to having dances held at
the college. Those who have followed
the discussions of this subject in the
papers must bé convinced that there is
widespread opposition to having dances
at Davidson. We feel sure that the stu-
dents of the college would not want the
Trustees to take an action that would
seem to be out of harmony with the deliv-
erances of the highest Court of our
Church, or in opposition to the wishes of
the controlling Presbyteries.

“The committee of students that pre-
sented the request of the students to the
Trustees stated that there were often
serious evils connected with dances which
are from time to time held in other
places and attended by some of the Da-
vidson students, This statement has trou-
bled us very much, With this statement
before us we wish to call the attention
of our students to an unusually fine para-

graph in an appeal which our General
Assembly in 1930 made to the young
people of the Church:

The General Assembly recog-
nizes the subtle temptations present-
ed through the appeals of present-
day recreational and social life or-
ganized into forms which may read-
ily lend themselves to abuses of un-
questionably harmful character.
Therefore the Assembly calls Chris-
and old, to a
of heart and
training of tastes, under the sought
guidance of the Holy Spirit in these
matters touching so vitally the per-
sonal and social life of professed
Christians.

tian people, young

careful searching

‘Recognizing the supreme author-
ity of the voice that speaks, “Come
ye out from among them and_ be
ye separate... . Touch not the un-
clean thing,” we call upon our peo-
ple to face squarely the issues pre-
sented by the complex life of to-
day, investigate their true character,
measure their ‘power to quicken or
deaden spiritual life and arrive at
character-making decisions which
shall control personal attitude.’

“2. In the second place, we recom-
mend that the faculty, with the above
principles in view, take cognizance of
the fact that groups of Davidson stu-
dents do dance in other places, and that
the faculty make such restrictions and
throw such safeguards about them as
shall, in the judgment of the faculty, be
for the best interests of the students and
of the college.’”

FLAMING FIVE

Those of you who read the Charlotte
Observer are no doubt interested in the
outcome of the Flaming Five contest that
is being put on by Jake Wade, sports
editor of the Observer, but how many
of you have cast your ballots for those
two “Flaming Wildcats,” Johnny Mack-
orell and Jim Morgan?

It is our duty to support these
Davidson aces and with the whole
hearted backing of all the readers
of The Davidsonian, they should be
able to place among the first five.
Mackorell, at this writing, is leading

the field with 455 votes, but George Bar-
clay trails by only five. Don’t let a
Pennsylvanian get more votes than a
good old North Carolinian and Wildcat.

Furthermore let’s put two North

Carolina Wildcats on this select

group. Jim Morgan merits a posi-

tion among the five best athletes
in the Carolinas, I’m sure. He has
for three years been a star flank-
man on the Wildcat eleven, he
ranks as one of the best centers on
any cage outfit in the two states,
and his superb performances on
the diamond for the past two sea-
sons is irrevocable.

Mail your votes in today, and give Da-
vidson the distinction of being the first
school to have two men on this selection
at the same time.

Professor P. H. Gwynn
Speaks in Greensboro

Dr. P. H. Gwynn, professor of edu-
cation and sociology, spoke in Charlotte
to a group of workers gathered at the
First Presbyterian Church on last
Wednesday night. This address was fol-
lowed on Sunday by a talk before a
conclave of young people at the Church
of the Covenant, in Greensboro.
