“No Davidson team has ever been An-
nihilated.”

“North Carolina State’s Wolfpack had
no soft touch in Davidson's Wildcats.”

The above quotations, selected from the
South's leading papers, seem to express

everyone's sentiments about the State
game.
Any team as light as Davidson's, in

which each man was outweighed more
than 13-pounds, deserves “a big hand for

The Seniors and Sophs were engaged
in a torrid contest Monday: a game
which featured frequent verbal battles
besides the play of innumerable triple
threats.

Partridge, Bell, Loftin,
Lewis comprised the brunt of the Seniors
attack, while Cline, Gilks, -Fort, and
Ganier led some very nice running plays
which offset, to some extent, the Sophs’
comparatively weak pass attacks.

The Juniors have what appears to be
an up and coming eleven, bowling over
the frosh easily and displaying enough
power to argue well for their future suc-
cess. Ken Knorr, captain, has already
admitted that the Centennials are merely
biding their time for the trOphy.

’Cats To Play Deacons
On Wake Forest Field

It has

been announced that the an-
nual Thanksgiving game between Wake
Forest and Davidson will be played this
year at Wake Forest. This contest had
been scheduled tentatively for Charlotte.
The game has been set aside this year by
the Baptists as “home-coming day,” so
naturally they would want it to be played
on their own campus.

The Wake Forest stadium has been
greatly improved and is in far better
shape now than in the past. The playing
field is smoothet and more regular while
the seating capacity has been enlarged
and can offer more comfort to the large
crowd .which always attend this game.
We hope to have a large number of
representatives there to show them that
the “Wildcat Spirit” is undying.

Seniors Conquer Sophomores and
Freshmen As Current

Season Opens
The Seniors won a thrilling extra-
period game against the Sophomores

Monday afternoon, 6-0, and took undis-
puted possession of first place in the
inter-class touch football competition.

A long pass from Sam Milton to Hank
Loftin, who was waiting over the goal-
line, came late in the extra-period and
proved to be the margin of victory that
kept the Seniors’ record clean, The sec-
ond-year men threatened throughout the
game, but they were unable to muster
that final punch to push the ball across
the goal-line. After the Seniors had made
their marker, the Sophomores intercept-
ed a pass and had the ball on the Seniors’
two-yard line when the game ended. For
the victors Bill Bell, Hank Loftin, Car-
lyle Lewis, and John Partridge stood out,
while the outstanding players for the
losers were “Buddy” Rainey, E. J. Ga-
nier, Bill Harris, Leonard Fort, William
Dixon and Roy Gilks.

In the first game of the current com-
petition, the Seniors defeated the Fresh-
men by the same score, 6-0, In the first
half a pass from Carlyle Lewis, captain
tf the Seniors’ team, to Jim Cothran
from the Frosh 10 yard line ré8ulted in
the game's only score. The first year
men provided a stubborn defense for the
Seniors’ powerful passing attack, and
although their intricate laterals proved
as puzzling to themselves as to their op-
ponents, they constantly harrassed the

Seniors’ defense with an accurate-passing
pair of sonthpaws, Buddy Young and
George Johnson. This pair-proved to be
outstanding for the Freshmen, while Jim
Cothran, Carlyle Lewis, Hank ~ Loftin,
John Partridge, Bill Benfield, Sam Mil-
ton, and Bill Bell all’ proved to be im-
portant factors in the Seniors’ victory.

In the other game played so far, the
Juniors’ passing combination
of Knorr and Walter Dickson
proved too strong for the Sophomores,
and the Juniors won, 12-0, The first score
came as a result of a long pass from
Knorr to Dixon, who had circled behind
the Sophomore safety ‘man and caught
the ball on a dead run, The second score
came from a short pass, again from
Knorr to Dixon, who snaked his way
through a broken field for fifty yards.
This last play was good for ninety yards.
For the Sophomores, “Buddy” Rainey,
Henry Lyons, “Sky” Cline, Dan #er-
son, Leonard Fort, Bill Harris, Willard
Dixon, and Lawrence Reid stood out.

This week the schedule is as follows:
Tuesday, Juniors vs. Freshmen; Wed-
nesday, Seniors vs. Juniors; and Thurs-
day, Sophomores ys, Freshmen.

Coach

McEver stated that Wood
Burns, varsity center, would definitely
be out of the Virginia game this week.
Burns was injured early in the State tilt
the past week. Big Six Johnston will
probably be out also as his old injury
is still giving him trouble.

The remainder of the squad is in fine
shape. Doc Newton, Davidson head
coach, is improving and should be with

the Wildcats in a few days.

Freshmen Will Meet Five Teams
This Season

Rounding into form for thier opening
game with Darlington here, Oct. 4, the
Davidson Wildkitten footballers are
ready to show a skeptical campus just
what is on their clawlets. Coach “Red”
Laird has been in process of sharpening
these little weapons and dulling the
rough edges since the opening week of
school, and from a tiny squad of twenty-
eight will send out a light, but spirited,
team to face the invading Georgia prep-
sters.

This season's frosh team will be es-

jal

ville boys, Rudisill and Mauney, being
the only ones to pack any weight, out of
a group of backs which includes in ad-
dition: Steere, Staire, Hunt, Harrison,
Sample, Edgerton, Long, Brown, Plonk,
and Hand, The line hefts a bit more per
man, but lacks reserves. The only men
out for line positions are: Ends: Hicks,
Iverson, McClelland, and Benfield.
Tackles: Warden, Johnston, Edwards,
and McMullen. Guards: Gasteiger, Mil-
ler, Ellis, and Summerell. Centers: Abel,
McCall, Moore.

It is yet too early to determine any
outstanding players from this squad, and
unsafe to make any predictions about
comparative. team_.strength.._However,
Coach Laird reports that the boys are
really working hard, and that the out-
look is for a better team than last year’s
yearling outfit.

After the Darlington game Friday,
the following teams will be met on the
Wildkittens’ schedule :

Oct. 18—State freshmen at Davidson.

Oct. 25—V. P. I. freshmen at Blacks-
burg, Va.

IN FALL TOURNEY

Hornbeck, Morrow, and Kenney
Seeded Next As Tourney
Gets Under Way

The fall tennis tournament for upper-
classmen opened with twenty-cight en-
tfties last Monday, September 30.

The seeded players are: 1 Carlyle
Lewis, 2 George Hornbeck, 3 Jake Mor-
row, 4 Bronston Kenny. .

The first round matches are as fol-
lows: Lewis vs. bye; C. Moore vs. Bill
Bell; Herb Willis vs. L. Woodward;
C. Crane vs. J. Cothran; Hornbeck vs.
bye; Bill Crooks vs. ‘I. Cameran; G.

vs. C. Carlson; C, Elder vs. A. O. Cooke;
L. Reid vs. Walker Harper; Tom Mar-
chant vs. Wade Boggs; B. Kenny vs. bye.

The tournament this year promises to
be interesting with the coming up of
two of the stars of last year’s freshman
team, Bronston Kenny and Harry Framp-
ton. These boys have been offering keen
competition for some of the, better play-
ers of the school in practice matches this
fall. Carlyle Lewis, seeded number oné
and: first man on the varsity team last
spring, is slated to reach the finals. Car-
lyle triumphed in a number of tourna-
ments this summer and reached the fin-
als in several other important net events.
George Hornbeck also will probably play
in some ofthe matches near the finals.

In the tournament last year Tommy
Phifer and Dudly Elvery reached ‘the
finals with Elvery defeating Phifer in
the last match. Both of these boys grad-
uated last spring leaving the title open.

to buy balls for the matches. As a com-

At the end of this tournament another
one will be held for the freshmen class.
There seems to be a wealth of material
on hand in the first year class from ob-
servation on the courts.

men and the freshmen tournament are
being run off under the supervision of

In the freshman cake race this after-

honors at first place, while they both
broke the present record of 9:35.5, held
by Earl Frazier. Their time for the race
was nine minutes-thirty-four and eight-
tenths seconds.

and Wilson were close behind to gain
the remaining three places.

Earl Frazier, winner of the cake race
three _years ago, has held the course
record’ up to now but it was broken this
afternoon by a margin of two seconds.
Neither of these men have ever had dny
track experience before but proved them-
selves to be good endurance runners to
win over a field of ninety-three freshmen.
; Last year there were fifty-eight men
who entered the race and this year the
record for entries: was broken by a mar-
gin of thirty-five. This is the largest
number of freshmen that have ever tried
out for honors in the, cake race event.

The winners for the race last year
were Rick White, who finished first with
