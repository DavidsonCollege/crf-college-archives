The men’s basketball team
took its shots this week at the Top
25, but mostly fired blanks.

Tuesday, No. 21 Wake Forest
came into Belk Arena and took a
74-62 win against the Wildcats.
Friday, in the first round of the
Carrier Classic in Syracuse, N.Y..,
Davidson used a strong second half
to top Iona 88-77. In the final on
Saturday, the Wildcats were over-
whelmed by No. 22 Syracuse, 89-
66.

Davidson opened the season
on Nov. 25 with a 93-68 win over
Roanoke. In that game, center
George Spain scored a career-high
24 points and pulled down eight
rebounds in just 21 minutes.

But just as the Wildcats could
dominate Roanoke inside, the Dea-
cons were able to control the lane
Tuesday. Tim Duncan, a 6’10”
sophomore center, ripped down 15
rebounds and blocked six shots in
36 minutes. He added 17 points.

Several times when the Wild-
cats tried to drive inside, Duncan
just stood waiting and turned the
shot back. In addition, Davidson
had trouble generating good shots
and often wound up pressuring and
taking bad shots.

_ “We shot too quickly, and
weren’t able to get any rebounds,”
Coach Bob McKillop says. “They

got every loose pall, They’re guys
were ready to go.”

Spain tried to hold his own
against Duncan, but the Wildcats
were hurt by the absence of 6’10”
junior Mark McGuire, out four
weeks with a stress facture in his
ankle.

Atlantic Coast Conference
Player-of-the-Year candidate and
probable first-round NBA draft
pick Randolph Childress threw in
a game-high 27 points.

Davidson was led by 23 points
from Brandon Williams and 14
from Quinn Harwood.

The Wildcats hung right with
the Deacons for the first half, go-
ing into the break down by just 32-
25. The margin was four, but Wake
Forest scooped up a turnover in the
final seconds, and Childress
drained a three-pointer at the
buzzer. :

Inthe second period, Davidson
pulled to 41-37 after Williams hita
three-pointer that got the crowd
going. But Childress came right
back down to the other end of the
court and put in a layup to quiet the
crowd again.

That basket started a 24-9 run
for Wake Forest that put the Dea-
cons up by 21 points and effec-
tively finished the Wildcats,

Davidson then traveled to up-
state New York for the weekend

Carrier Classic in Syracuse. The
Orangemen have not lost a game in
the tournament since 1981.

The. Wildcats opened with a
Friday matchup with Iona and, af-
ter a sluggish first half, scored 63
points to pull out the 11-point win.
Harwood was the high scorer with
20 points. Williams and Chris
Alperteach had 17, and Spain threw
in 13.

The game was tied at 59 with
about 12 minutes remaining be-
fore Williams converted an ally-
oop pass from Harwood to start a
run. Spain hit four straight shots,
and Williams made two outside
shots to help the Wildcats bust out.

Saturday, Davidson lined up
against the Big East power in
Syracuse’s home arena with over
21,000 wild and cheering
Orangemen fans.

Syracuse used a 19-0 run in
the first half to break the game
open, led by 22 at the half and won
by 23. The Wildcats didn’t have
answers for All-American guard
Lawerence Moten or tournament
MVP John Wallace. Moten wound
up with 21 points on 9-for-18 shoot-
ing, while Wallace had 17 points,
eight rebounds, and six assists.

The Wildcats wanted to keep
the game a slow-paced affair, but

community will help out with the
tournament. Athletes from the
baseball, volleyball, soccer, bas-
ketball, and swimming teams will
be doing everything from passing
out programs to directing traffic,
and faculty and community mem-
bers will act as hosts on the shuttle
buses from the parking lots. Pro-
fessor Lawing from the music de-
partment will lead the national an-
them with his trumpet chorus.

But this year marks the last
time that Davidson will put on the
show. Next year the champion-
ship will be played at the Univer-
sity of Richmond. The NCAA de-
cided that the event was becoming
too big for the little town.

Both Sargent and Athletic
Director Terry Holland feel that
the decision to move was prema-
ture. “We knew that we would
lose it eventually,” says Holland,
“but I think that we could have
feasibly done it for another two
years.”

Holland says that the champi- ~

onship has had a substantial effect

on Davidson. “The original idea
was that it would help our own
soccer program. It seemed like it
would be a fun thing to do in which
we could bring the community to-
gether.”

Davidson soccer is now more
enthusiastic than ever, and recruits
instantly recognize Davidson as
the home of the soccer finals.
Admissions in general have found
the championships a positive thing.
Davidson has more name recogni-
tion than ever, and students across
the country are becoming increas-
ingly interested in the school. The
championship also led to

Davidson’s acquisition of the’

Wednesday night “Soccer Weekly”
games.

“When we first started, people
were hesitant, but most people have
been swept away with the excite-
ment,” says Holland, “it really
shows off our community. The
publicity may eventually affect the
growth of the area, but now it is
hard to tell.”

Visitors will also have a
chance to see the college in action.

Davidson has been preparing for the Final Four tournament by installing temporary
bleachers on Richardson Field to accomodate the crowds.

ing UNC-Wilmington on Satur-
day night, and visitors who show
their NCAA ticket stubs get $2 off
of their basketball tickets. Four
thousand people are expected to
attend the game.

With so many people expected
to be on campus, security poses a
problem. When teams play in such
highly publicized games, substan-
tial protection and security must
be provided. As a result, a “‘co-
coon” must be built around
Richardson Field. Sargent states
the problem: “parking is the a
hurdle.”

In the letter posted for the stu-

dents, faculty. and staff, Sargent
apologizes for the hassle but hopes
that “the fun and thrill associated
with hosting a national champion-
ship tournament will more than
make up for these inconveniences.”
Davidson first held the cham-
pionships in 1992, when
Davidson’s team competed in the
tournament. Eight thousand people
attended that year, and 10,000came
last year. This year, with just over
12,000 spectators expected to fill
the stands, the tournament has seen
growth that Sargent says can be
attributed to the Davidson spirit.
‘“The championship will move

on next year because we have made
it bigger and better than the NCAA
could have ever imagined and be-
cause Richmond had a 22,000 seat .
stadium near an interstate highway
exit. We want toremind the NCAA
and the city of Richmond that it did

not get better because it got bigger,

but it got bigger because it got
better,” says Sargent.

Sargent and Holland both
agree that the NCAA Soccer Tour-
nament brings out the best in
Davidson. “So many groups who
normally go their own ways work
together to put this on,” says Hol-
land.
