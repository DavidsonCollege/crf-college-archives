We are mighty glad to see the cur-
tain ring down on the football season
of 1928, not because we mind getting
licked as much as we hate to see the
Wildcats fight a -hopeless battle for
victory. Every game found them bat-
tling against far superior men, giving
all they had to stem an inevitable tide
of defeat. Never, it seems to us, has
Davidson had less football material,
less actual power to offer her foes.
Those latter games in the state were
heart-breaking ones, and for that rea-
son we are relieved now that they are
past.

———

For the first time in years, the
Wildcats failed to furnish an “up-
set” of the dope. True they held
some teams to close scores, but in
no instance did they really surprise
the sport world. To spring an up-
set, a team must have at least the
potential power, and Davidson
didn’t have that this year. Compar-
ing the material sent to Younger
and Tilson with that given any
other state school, we are moved
to pay more tribute than ever to
the marvelous ability of those two
Spartans of the Gridiron.

Another season will bring new hope.
If the freshmen gridders of this year
stay with us and benefit in a normal
way by the spring practice period,
then next fall’s eleven should be some
better than the one now making its
exit. That line has got to have some
“beef’—intelligent ‘“beef’—to swap
blows with the opposition—to be able
to run a sustained offensive instead
of being doomed to a defensive game
because of a lack of weight.

If the last two seasons of Davidson
football don’t serve to wake the al-
umni up then they are not even faintly
interested in their Alma Mater.

The Tiirkey Day clash at Dur-
ham was just a case of too much
brawn and experience against a
lighter and less adept team. The
first half was all Duke, and the
Cats were on their heels the whole
time, Murray and Godfrey showed
great drive as they ripped through
the Wildcat line, and Buie con-
tinued his passing tactics for good
gains. Davidson rallied in the
final period and kept the Blue
Devils worried, but it was too late
to do much damage. Duke un-
covered a neat aerial game, but it
did not appear to be as deceptive
as Carolina’s. This Buie can really
throw those things through, and
his receivers are no slouches.

Captain Baker, Leftwich, and Thad
Brock played best for the Cats.
Brock’s kicking is better every game.
Some of the ones he got off Thurs-
day were exceptional, because the
Devil line was rushing him to death,
and it seemed that every one would
smeared. That Duke line is the
hadest charging one we’ve seen this
year and they are going to give Caro-
lina a tough time of it.

be

In spite of Buie’s passing and the
forward line ahead of him, we look
for the Tar Heels to tame Duke
next week-end. It’s been many a
year since a team around'this neck
of the woods could come back and
win so consistently as do the Tar
Heels. When one drive fails, Col-
lins runs.in another téam and starts
all-over. The Davidson and Vir-
ginia games are evidence of that
wonderful reserve strength and
versatility of attack which are
Carolina’s. Then, too, that thirty-
five year winning streak of the Tar
Heels is going to inject a lot of
helpful psychology into the fray**
Anyway it goes, the game is sure
to be a thriller.

Cage practice is assuming a more
business-like attitude every day. It
sounds good to hear the swish of the
o'd leather again. Furman University
comes here on January ninth to open
the season. The Hurricane has blown
Davidson aside pretty thoroughly for
the last year or two, and the Cats are
out for a scalp this time. The schedule
this season is one of the best ever
given a Wildcat team. Calls for some
real playing to chalk up most of the
game®on the win side of the score-
book.

We are going to pick an all-state |
team next time. Want to wait and

Nucleus

In preparation for the heavy bas-
ketball schedule which the ‘Cats are
carrying this year, Capt. Carl Prit-
chett is putting the would-be squad
through the paces in a of
setting-up exercises each afternoon.

Coach Monk Younger announces
that regular practice for the varsity
will be held each afternoon up until
the Christmas holidays and the Fresh-
men each night. At the return to
school after the holidays regular prac-
tice will again be He also
that there a possibility of
having a game some time before the
20th. ‘ :

The material is looking good and
there is plenty té choose from. The
weeding out process will begin soon
and in view of this fact every man is
really ‘putting out in the practices.
There are about 18 good men out, in-
cluding Capt. Carl Pritchett, a ‘letter
man last year and one of the main-
stays of this year’s team, also R. G.
Calhoun, who made
years ago.

From last year’s squad we have:
Miller, Moore, Crawford, Smith, Kug-
ler, Baker, McGavock, Johnson, and
Heefer. Last year’s Fresh team also
donates some valuable material in:
Goodson, Proctor, Wilson, Overman,
McCall, Rusk, Hood and Shepard.

The main trip of the season will be
up through Virginia where they will
play such schools as V. M. I., V. P. I.

Princeton on the Map

Princeton, N. J. (by New Student
Service).—Milions who are denied the
privilege of dying for dear old Siwash
nevertheless have come to know our
colleges as intimately as if they had
attended one, Thanks to Hollywood's
many films of “college life,” the plain
people now recognize a tattooed slick-
er when they see it and are able to tell
you with some assurance that a college
is a place where men wear battered
headpieces, where rooms are decorated
with “Keep off the Grass” signs and
where football games invariably end
with fifty-yard dashes and last minute
scores for the home eleven.

The latest of these educational films
is called “Varsity” and some interest-
ing stories are told about it. It has
been the custom to make these films a’
the hospitable University of Southern
California but lately the tendency has
been to vary the scenery. “Varsity”
was to have been taken at Yale but
the authorities demurred, Princeton
was found willing, so the story was
fitted out with Princeton names

Only The Tiger, Princeton's comic
magazine, failed to sce the joke. The
issue of that magazine for last June

criticized the administration for turn-
ing the campus into a temporary Hol- |
lywood. Several telegrams were
secured from alumni. Mr. Struthers
