JONES, from page 10

Could to War and Peace. Again, the issue
is copy over images. The Davidsonian

deadlines when they do not see their ar-
ticles in print for another week. That was
the basic scenario last week as the Tuesday
5 PM deadline became a Monday issue.
Furthermore, with such mismanage-
ment, all the news/sports/features are ar-

chaic. Who wants to read a story about a>

football game that happened ten days ago
or a review of a film they already saw?

Secondly, the personal attacks made on
Mr. Ed Powell and Mr. Richard Jones were,
at least, unprofessional. They were, at
most, libel.

Not only did this newspaper openly ridi-
cule two writers, but it did so totally out of
context, especially in Mr. Jones’ case. As
a result of his showing interest enough to
write a letter to the editor, he received in
return an assault that he was unable to

people abuses journalistic license.

Also, it seems quite inconsistent to
complain about the dearth of writers, then
openly criticize those who do contribute.
Hence, last week’s editorial page was a
study in illogic.

before it goes into print, and he will be able
to take my arguments out of context as he
did Mr. Jones’. As a result, I am using the
spell-checker immediately after finishing
this letter. ,
I apologize to both Mr. Powell and Mr.
_ Jones for this newspaper’s unprofessional
actions.

Sincerely, 5

Hap Bryant, sports editor

Irealize that the editor will read my letter

ing my letter with spelling errors included
is a violation of The Davidsonian editorial
policy. Furthermore, it isa cheap shot.
The Davidsonian belongs to the people
of Davidson College. It is not the sole
property of the news staff. My first letter
intends not to libel any member of the news
staff, but it calls on students to submit

quality over quantity, prose over space-

filler to their Davidsonian. We, as.a whole,
are capable of a better publication. The
purpose of my first letter made clear, I will
contend with most of your remaining criti-
cisms. f

First, The Washington Post is an interna-

- tional daily of, roughly, 160 pages (double

that number on Sunday). Comparing The
Davidsonian to The Washington Post is
like comparing The Little Engine That

bathroom., Everyone should have learned

in kindergarten that if you make a mess,

then you should clean it up.

Obviously, this partier did not attend

‘kindergarten. Since the person was

unable to find the-toilet, he or she-was

clearly too sick to clean up the disgusting
mess. We understand this. But that

person could have respected the inhabi-

tants of the hall enough.to remove the
mess the following morning, before all
the inhabitants had the pleasure to.
experience it.

Instead, this person did not accept the
consequences of his or her actions. So
the rest of us had to talk in and smell

vomit for two days. And even-worse, the —

janitor, John Houston, had to clean up for
one partier's irresponsibility. Is this Fair?
Is it really in the jahitor's job description

oy

to clean up two-day-old vomit because
one of us was too good to clean it up?
If students do not inflict the conse-

"quences of this partying so blatantly, and

disgustingly, upon your fellow Davidson
community members. This is not the ~
first time it has happened her, and Watts
is not the only-dorm in which ithas ~
occurred. Lomiants it be the last time?

Doug Hicks and Flake Sherrill

‘ needs to be chock full of the best print

available.

Second, the quality of the prose found in
the Georgia State Signal surpasses. the
Davidsonian. Granted, Georgia State has a -
larger student body anda larger news staff.
But, if The Davidsonian is the product of a —
selective institution, then how does one
justify a far superior student paper from a
school where the median SAT is 950?

Third, Hunter $. Thompson is an icon,
someone with whom somebody can iden-
tify. Personal taste aside, evoking Th-
ompson corresponds with the first letter’s
call for controversial yet insightful journal-
ism. Perhaps, I should have made the
reference to George Will.

Nevertheless, the final paragraph of your -
reply, aside from the fact itis a bitter attack
on my personal integrity and is in bad taste
(you have anexcellentcareer ahead writing
for Bob Guccione), is well written. The
paragraph has a clear, even style with bril-
liant use of modifiers. Therefore, my task
moves to its fruition. —

Ihave enjoyed the challenge of retorting
and I hope we may continue the dialogue.

~on any subject of your choosing. Maybe, —

someday, with your gentle prodding, I will
count myself among. the virtually literate.
