“y” SERVICE. REMAI

Popular Physici Speaks of Some
Problems of College Life.

Speaking before a good crowd,
Sunday evening Dr. Wilson McCon-
nell took as his subject an old Greek
proverb running “It is good to be
tich, it is good to be strong, but it
is better to be loved by many
friends.” He showed that riches and
strength were good things and that
they should be sought by everyone,
but that in themselves they could
not bring lasting happiness unless
used for the benefit of others.

Dr. McConnell made several
practical applications of this prin-
cipal to college life, showing that
men should use their offices and
honors by relating a very touching
incident of a country doctor who
made everyone love him by his life
of unselfish service and who was
honored after death by the epitaph
“office upstairs.”

C. E. SOCIETY ENJOYS PICNIC.

All the students will be happy to
learn of the recent decision that Dr.
Richards has made in regard to his
remaining at Davidson. Since hear-
ing that he had recently received
several offers from large cities, the
boys have been watching and wait-
ing for his decision and earnestly
hoping that it would be as he has
made it.

Among other great churches that
have tried to secure Dr. Richards, is
the First Church of Savannah, one
of our leading Southern churches.
He has made a great sacrifice in
remaining with us on the small
salary that Davidson affords its

the time and service of as great a
servant of God; the students ap-
preciate the sacrifices our pastor

his great service among us.

CAMPUSISMS.

Dr. Thomas Lingle visited Gas-
tonia Sunday.

Last Saturday afternoon the C.
E. held its long anticipated picnic.
The picnicers left the Presbyterian
Church in the early afternoon, and
returned in the silver light of the
accommodating old moon. From
the games of the afternoon to the
songs around the camp fire—the
whole affair was a delightful suc-
cess. The supper, spread under a
group of spreading oaks, was by far
the most popular event of the out-
ing. As far as the eats go, it is
enough to say that every one was
“plum full,” and then some.

The tri-color contest, which has
been underway in the Society for
the yast five weeks, closed Sunday.
The Red team made a sensational
gain of points in the eleventh hour,
and took the first place away from
the Blues by a score of 548 to 531.
The two losing teams will enter-
tain the winners at a feed next Fri-
day night.

week.

Mr. F. L. Jackson is to be con-
gratulated upon the arrival at his
home on last Monday mornin

Those present at the movies this
week enjoyed an unusually good
picture, Dustin Farnum in Captain
Courtesy. The special features
were in good scenery and the ex-
pert riding. Of course the numer-
ous admirers of Mary Pickford
were disappointed at not seeing her
star acting as usual but even these
were appeased by the excellence uf
Dustin Farnum's well known play-
ing. The spectators were also treat-
ed to an excellent musical program
rendered by Jojo’s Jazz Band. These
skillful sons of Orpheus swayed tlic
audience at will moving them from
ecstasies of joy almost to tears.
This is one of the best shows we
have had this spring and we hope
the remaining ones will be even
better.

H. Smith, '20, had the misfortune
to sprain his leg one day last week.
