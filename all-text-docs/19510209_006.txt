DUKE MAGAZINE SATIRES ENDOWERS;
PRES. EDENS GROANS, EDITOR QUITS

The Duke and Duchess, student
humor magazine at Duke Univer.
sity has been suspended -by the
Publications Board under orders
from University officials because of
a satirical and off-color series of
articles on the Duke family, en-
dowers of the Durham institution.

Walt Wadlington of Biloxi,
Miss., editor of the magazine at
the time of its final effort, was
told personally by Duke President
Hollis Edens that “This is the
greatest crisis of my educational
career.”

Edens had good reason to be wor-
ried. First, the magazine not only
satirized ‘the Dukes but probably
libeled them, although that would
be up to a jury. Secondly, Edens
has been president of the school at
Methodist Flats for scarcely more
than a year.

Just five writers besides Wad-
lington worked on the issue of the
mag, which was devoted from co.
ver to cover to the Duke (alias
Littleworth) family.

The magazine, scheduled for pub-
lication prior to Christmas holidays
but not released until shortly after,
traces the Littleworth clan from
the first Duke and Duchess of
Littleworth Scurvey and Godiva,
across the Atlantic to colonial
America and up to Diane Little-
worthr(who makes not the feeblest
pretense at being anyone but Doris
Duke).

The magazine was completely
distributed on campus and through
the mail, but don’t go running to
Duke planning on picking up a
stray copy. As a Duke Chronicle

weak team and this year is no
exception. Clemson has one of the
smoothest-working offenses and
some of the best screening and
breaking in the business. Coach
Baird is confident, however, that
if the boys will continue in their
rejuvenated strain and sparkling
play, they will upset one of the
members of the top ranks sooner
or later. Sooner could be Clemson,
and later could be Dook Monday
night.

It is quite evident that the SAE’s
are not the same since the loss of
Bob Bennett at mid semester and
therefore haven't been too success-
ful so far this season. In gaining
a victory for his team Chuck EI-
liott garnered 12 points, but was
closely followed by several others.

for dear life.” And so is everyone
else.

Editor Wadlington was called into
Hollis Edens’ office when the ad-
ministration first took note of the
contents of the issue of The Duke
and Duchess.

Waddlington put on the squeeze,
and said he would blow the whole
mess sky-high in the press if he
or anyone else involved in the pub-
lication were tossed out of school.
His bluff wasn't called but he didn’t
keep his job long.

The Publications Board met on
Tuesday, January 23, voted to “ac-
cept his resignation,” then approved
the suspension of the magazine.

if not explicitly, it seems inevitable
that if we students don’t soon do
something about our conduct, the
administration and faculty will; and
it is almost certain that one thing
they will not do is forsake a tra-
ditional weekday group devotional
chapel for a rip-snorting, steam-
letting student-day chapel.

Certainly nothing constructive
can be done, outside of administra.
tion and faculty coercion, without
resourceful, forceful, student lead.
ership. This is primarily a Student
Council function and responsibility.
Lately, we have heard nothing
from them concerning this matter.
It could make a forceful and prob-
ably successful effort to improve
chapel conduct.

Where has our Student Chapel
Committee been all year? One would
think that it is related to the
Ursidae (bear) family, some of
whose members have the peculiar
habit of hibernating from Fall to
Spring. The responsibility for plan-
ning student programs, and, also
making suggestions to higher au-
thorities certainly rests partially
with them.

Part of the responsibility rests
with Dr. Cunningham in planning
interesting programs on his day.

The final part of the responsi-
bility rests with us students to be
co-operative with our leaders, sym-
pathetic for the tremendous respon.
sibility and difficulty involved in
providing good programs, and in.
itiative in making suggestions. for
program improvement, and, above
all, reverent during devotions and
religious talks, and courteous to
everybody on the platform. Then,
and only then, will we have even a
partially legitimate claim to the
now delusive term, “Davidson gen-
tlemen.”

If we do not initiate some con-
structive action among ourselves,
we had better be prepared to take
the consequence of any action the
administration and faculty may de-
cide to enforce!

The motivating factors of our
chapel conduct involve another as-
pect of this subject which does not
permit developing. However, it
might be suggested that a large
part of the motivation lies, per-
haps, in certain aspects of reactions
to student - faculty and student.
administration relations, which top-
ic will have to be saved for another
time —J. T. M.

Education Concept

In America Receives|

Much Modification

New York, N. Y.—(I.P.)—The
American concept of education and
its application are undergoing a
revolution which started a full cen.
tury ago and has reached its cli-
max in the past five years, accord-
ing to Dr. Oliver C. Carmichael,
president of the Carnegie Found.
ation for the Advancement of
Teaching.

Writing in the Foundation’s 45th
annual report, Dr. Carmichael
points out that “No consistent,
clear-cut philosophy of. American
higher education has yet béen for-
mulated. The British conception
which largely dominated up to 1850
has been rejected. The 19th cen.
tury German model in research and
graduate work has been generally
adopted, but the fundamental pur-
pose of . . . education as a social
enterprise has never been clearly
stated. That is the reason for the
current confusion.”

The trend toward a more flexible
curriculum, through the elective
system, promoted by Harvard’s
president, Charles W. Eliot, dur.
‘ing the last quarter of the nine-
teenth century, is regarded in the
report as a major educational re.
form.

But “this revolutionary idea” has
produced growing “confusion,” Dr.
Charmichael stresses. The expan-
sion of the-curriculum and the wid.
er freedom of choice for students
“opened the way for the prolifera-
tion of courses,” which attracted
“unprecedented numbers to col-
lege.”

Through the elective system, “the
intellectual tone of colleges and uni-
versities has undoubtedly suffered
losses, and the public has been
thoroughly confused by the lack
of distinction between education
and training.” But the questions it
raised, Dr. Charmichael concludes,
forced thoughtful educators after
decades of complacence, to “recon.
sider the aims and purposes of high-
er education and to revise the con.
tent and methods of instruction.”

its Pedagogical Department is

The Institute is making every

that arrangements had been com.| possible to students who have reg.

pleted with five famous European
universities to ease summer school
registration for American students.

In the past, Americans interested
in combining summer travel and
study abroad had either to write
to the universities for information
or trust to their luck and apply
for admission on arrival. As most
universities limit enrollment in
their summer schools, students
coming from the United States
were likely to be refused admis-
sion because quotas had been fil-
led. By facilitating advance reg.
istration, the Institute of Univer.
sity Studies Abroad guarantees
that much past confusion can now
be avoided.

In 1951 there are to be Summer
Schools at the Sorbonne (Paris),
Madrid, Fribourg, Oxford, and at
the University College, Dublin. Ox-
ford is holding a series of residen-
tial lectures under the general title
of “Arts in England in the Seven.

Together with a well-known tra-
vel agency, the Institute has pre.
pared a series of tours in connection
with the summer schools in Europe,
thus helping the students get a
background knowledge of Europe
and its current problems.

Portland University
Introduces Courses

In Eng. Composition

To design a course in freshman
composition that is of greatest val-
ue to incoming students with va-
ried interests and backgrounds, the

English department at the Univer-.

sity of Portland has undertaken the
following program this year, ac.
cording to Alexander Scharbach,
assistant professor in charge of
freshman English:

1. To learn from the heads of
all departments and schools of the
university what specific skills and
knowledge they want their stu-
dents to gain from freshman com-
position.

2. To give objective tests to en-
tering freshmen to determine how
well prepared each freshman is to
master the skills and knowledge
agreed upon by the responsible
heads and the English department.
At present, two standard tests are
given so that the student and his
advisers can learn how he com-
pares with students in other col-
leges and universities.

3. To discover through these
tests, the most. able students and
to give them instruction suited to
their capacities. The incoming
freshmen with poorer backgrounds
are also thus noted and from the
first week on their English instruc-
tors have an objective analysis of’
the strength and weakness of each
student.

4. To insure a degree of uniform.
ity in both learning and instruction
by giving departmental semester
examinations to all sections.

“With the assistance of the de-

partment of education,” Professor]

Scharbach said, “we are now mak-
ing two additional studies and sur-
veys: one to determine the effect.
iveness of instruction in freshman
composition, and the other to learn
the reading habits and tastes of all
the male students of the universi-
ty.”
