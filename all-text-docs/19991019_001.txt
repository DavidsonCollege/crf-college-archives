On Thursday, October 7, 1999, the Davidson
community celebrated the groundbreaking for the
new Knobloch Campus Center, a building that has
been talked about for the last 15 years. The new
center will take on most of the functions of the
currently overburdened Union. The Knobloch
Campus Center will be built using the existing

structure of Johnston Gym-will house the book-
store, the Union Café, WALT, the 900 Room, a
fitness room, student organization offices, a copy
center, and a fully functional post office.

Perhaps most exciting is a new 600-seat
Performing Arts Center that will be put to good
use by the Theatre and Music Departments.

In his opening remarks of the grounbreaking
celebration, President Bobby Vagt described the
cool fall afternoon as “a special day in the life of

large construction equipment, which enhanced the construction

decorated atmosphere.

. Whose generous gift to

Davidson College.” He con-
tinued by expressing his
pleasure that in building this
state-of-the-art facility,
Davidson would be able to
“restore a historic building,”
and displayed excitement at
the “limitless opportunities
for the future” provided by
the new campus center.
The new student cen-
ter was the dream of the
l6ngtime Union director C.
Shaw Smith, Vagt noted, as
he proceeded to recount
some of his own memories
of the man. Vagt’s speech
was followed by words from
Dean of Faculty, Dr. Clark
Ross, Dean of Students, Dr.
Thomas Shandley, Will Th-
ompson ’00, and Foster
Haselden ’00. Following
these opening statements,
the female a cappella group,
The Delilahs, and the male a
cappella group, The Gener-
als, entertained the crowd. «—

daughters who are alumni. Vagt characterized
him as a man who, without fail, does what he
sees as right. At this point, Mr. Knobloch took
the time to share a few words with the crowd on

New campus center gives hope

By RICHARD VINSON

Davidson's own WALT 1610 is undergoing
big changes this year in hopes of improving its
image and the quality of its programming. The
members of the executive board have been taking
great strides in many areas. Among these are a
new office in the Union, better equipment, and
more “listener friendly” programming.

The new broadcasting room in the Union
offers many advantages over the old one, accord-
ing to DJ Chas Willimon ‘02. Not only is the room
itself more comfortable and more organized, but it
is also closer to the center of campus and thus
more easily accessible.

WALT is also making improvements in its

equipment. The old antenna has finally been
repaired and is capable of producing a much stron-
ger signal, enabling clearer reception in the David-
son area. More- ‘
over, the station
willsoon receive
new remote
broadcasting
equipment. This
addition will al-
low WALT to
cover campus
events such ‘as
the choral con-
certs and home
sporting events.
Perhaps

most dramatic are the changes made in program-
ming. In years past, WALT DJs had more or less
free reign over what they played. Although that
