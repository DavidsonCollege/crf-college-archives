the “largest factor” in inflated
costs. Substantial increases in
the price of library books,
athletic and laboratory equip-
ment, oil, and electricity were
further cited as causes for the
rise in costs.

student fee of $4,510 includes

‘‘When you consider that
most of the other top indepen-

bargain,” the Comptroller no-

Marshall fears regression

By TRACY UPCHURCH
Staff Writer

Peyton Marshall, student
member of the Educational
Policy Committee, warned the
Senate to watch’ for a shift
toward a more conservative
curriculum.

Marshall spoke to the Sen-
ate at the invitation of Presi-
dent Thom Young. The talk
was part of Young’s efforts to
inform the Senate of college
policy.

There is an undercurrent. of
feeling to abolish certain
‘fringe areas’’, such as Ex-
tended Studies and non-West-
ern studies. He stated that
many of the curriculum inno-
vations which came about
several years ago are in danger
of being lost as the college
enters a more complacent per-
iod.

The committee expects to
re-evaluate having two stu-
dents as members. Roger

Brown now serves as the other.

student on the committee.

Marshall urged the Senate
to be very cautious in appoint-
ing the new student members
this spring because the com-
mittee’s actions are far-reach-
ing and affect all students.

To insure continuity and
expertise, he recommended
that at least one of the
members be no more than a
rising junior.

Much of. the committee's
work is done in secrecy and in
sub-committees. After the
committee votes on a report
there is @ five-day period
before it is acted on by the
faculty. Students have this
period to react to the commit-
tee’s report.

Although the committee
works in secrecy to protect the
free exchange of ideas, Mar-
shall said the group is open to
student input.

The Senate has begun its
process of appointing students
to the administration and
faculty councils and commit-
tees.

Parliamentarian Percy Bad-
ham explained the process,
which will divide the Senate
into four screening commit-
tees. Each group will nomin-
ate candidates to positions on
three committees.

Badham will head the first
group which will nominate
students to the Bookstore and
Alumni Activities Committees
as well as the Council on
Campus and Religious Life.
Interviews for the positions
will begin next week.

The full Senate will vote on
candidates on a rotating basis.
This will enable unsuccessful
candidates to seek positions
on other committees.

The Senate voted unani-
mously to allocate $150 to-
ward the purchase of two
portable black and white tele-
visions for the Infirmary. This
money is matched by the Dean
of Students Office.

In a unanimous vote, Taine
Allison and Charlie Strange
were appointed to the Club
Sports Council.

education for their sons and
daughters.”

“Jt is important to remem-
ber that student fees make up
less than half of our annual

operating income,’ said Vice-
President for Development
Duane Dittman.

“Earnings from our endow-
ment, gifts, grants, and trust
funds are expected to total
approximately $7.5 million in
1977-78. In effect, this is an
unseen subsidy of about
$1,900 per student toward the
$6,000 cost of a Davidson
education.”

The second item approved
by the Board of Trustees was
the decision for the college to
return to the Southern Con-
ference. This decision started
as a recommendation from the
Athletic Department, and was
based on four factors, accord-
ing to College President Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr.

One, it would be neither
possible nor practical for Dav-
idson to organize a separate
conference.

Two, Virginia Military In-
stitute’s decision to re-enter
the Conference represented a

rehensive fee

return of a school which is
comparable in size to David-
son and has been a long-time
associate of the college.

Three, the Conference urged
Davidson to remain despite
the fact that the college does
not intend to play football
with many Conference
schools.

Four, the basketball staff
felt that Davidson has a better
chance to play in post-season
tournaments through partici-
pation in the Conference.

The third decision reached
by the Board of Trustees was
the approval of the idea of a
College Commons.

Given Davidson’s overcrow-
ded dining facilities, the col-
lege had two options open to
it, according to Spencer. Eith-
er it could enlarge its present
facilities, expending a ‘‘good
deal of money”’ on a project
which ‘‘would probably not be
completely satisfactory’’, or it
could build another facility.

Rabil criticizes Council’s
Language House rejection

‘By STEPHANIE COOK
Staff Writer

“This rejection is a definite
setback for the language pro-
gram at Davidson.”

So spoke senior Mark Rabil,
evaluating a recent decision by
the Council on Campus and
Religious Life which turned
down a proposal to establish
language houses at Davidson.
_ Rabil submitted the propo-
sal, which would have allowed
students in each of three -
languages— Spanish, German,
and French—to live in three of -
the college’s perimeter sca
ing facilities.

While in the houses, stu- .

dents were to speak their
foreign language. Each house
was to serve as a cultural -
center, with the residents
‘sponsoring programs, films,
small parties, discussions, and
other. activities.

The Council's, three argu-
ments against the proposal
were: 1) it would be unfair to
take three of the eight avail-
able off-campus houses which
have traditionally been re-

served for seniors. 2) giving an
off-campus house to this spec-
ial-interest group might stim-
ulate an undesirable ‘‘snowball
effect’’ encouraging other
small groups to seek similar

Rabil

privileges. 3) Davidson main-
tains a liberal arts outlook
with emphasis on exposure to
many different interest areas,
and language houses would
not allow for sufficient inter-
action with these areas.

bil contests the Council’s
line of reaso: . “They said
they . rejected the proposal
acted it is not fair to give

one of the most desired places
to live to a specialized group of
students. I think that ‘fair-
ness’ argument is an overused
and ultimately detrimental cli-
che.

“The establishment of lan-
guage houses at Davidson
would be beneficial to several
aspects of the College com-
munity.” Not only would they
greatly improve the language
program, they would increase
extracurricular activities and
would be a good public rela-
tions stimulus, Rabil com-
mented.

“Recently, I was  exten-
sively involved with the deci-
sion to assign Rusk House to
the women’s group. The
Council felt that giving the
house to this group— which
caters to a special interest—
would be beneficial to the
social system at Davidson. |

“By rejecting the language
houses, the Council has acted
inconsistently with the Rusk
House decision. In the same
way that the women *s house is
