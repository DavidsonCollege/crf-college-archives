SAM BRADY

Sam Brady, probably the best
known man of Davidson to the
student body, died in a hos-
pital at Statesville, North Car-
olina, on June 29; 1923. Mr.
Brady had been taken to Dr.
Long's Sanitorium to undergo
an operation for appendicitis,
but far had the disease
taken its grip on him that he
died immediately following the

su)

operation,

While a student at Davidson,
he occupied a position in the
heart of every member of the
college, both students and fac-
ulty, which was none the less
equalled by those who knew

him after his graduation in
June of 1921, He was a mem-
ber of the Kappa Sigma frater-
nity, and played varsity cen-
ter on the Davidson football
squad for the four years he was
in school. Immediately follow-
ing his graduation he accepted
a position with the Southern
Cotton Oil Company and work-
ed with that concern until
about the first of December,
1922 when he returned to Da-
vidson to fill the position of
Cashier in the Bank of David-
son.

He is survived by his mother,
Mrs. L. R. Brady and a sister
Miss Susie Brady to whom are
extended the sincere sympathy
of their large circle of friends
and the entire student body of
Davidson College who-has lost /
a worthy friend, a sincere coun-
sellor and a deserving alumnus.
