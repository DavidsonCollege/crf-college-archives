SATURDAY

THE SPORTS PARADE

P. J.C. MEETS
FRESHMEN
HERE FRIDAY

When we were considering the chances
of the Wildcats for the year in last
week’s issue, we had high expectations
for them, but after listening to Coach
Newton’s opinion and noticing that sev-
eral of the state’s sports writers have
picked Davidson to take possession of
the cellar berth in the Big Five stand-
ings, we're almost afraid to even pre-
dict an outcome for the Duke-Davidson
game.

We were all ready to prophesy a 12-0 vic-

tory for Davidson over the Blue Devils, bas-
ing our opinion on several facts. Davidson's

varsity outplayed Wallace Wade's team here |

last year and, despite a 0-0 score, showed

that the Wildcats was the best team on the!

Coach Whittle is making plans for the
annual Freshman cake race, which will
| be’ run on a 1.7 mile course again’ this
| year. Prizes will be awarded to the 20
| Freshmen who run the distance in’ the
| shortest time. The race is held annually
to discover material among the Fresh-
men for distance running.

But Coach Doc Newton is of a different |

opinion, “First,” says Newton, “we're play- |
ing in Duke’s stadium, and then besides the!
0-0 tie which Davidson
year will make it all the harder to beat them|
this year.”. Newton also reminds us that |
Wallace Wade has had two years in which}
to install his system at Duke, while a new)
style of play is being used here for the Aret}
time this season.

And in addition to all this Wade has
been working with his squad two pe-
riods each day since Labor Day, and
will continue to hold two workouts until
September 22nd when the school opens.
Newton, on the other hand, has had to
be content with only one practice ses-
sion daily since September 8th. This
means that the Blue Devils will be bet-
ter drilled in fundamentals, will have a
smoother working offense, and will be
better on the defense than the Wild-
cats.

To put it in Newton’s own words, “David-
son’s squad is not mentally-equipped to fur-
nish any great opposition to a first-class ball
club.”

“If Davidson-holds Duke to two touch-
downs,” ‘says the Wildcat mentor, “we'll
be tickled to death. And.-if Duke does
not beat us by at least three touch-
downs, then the Blue Devils are a rotten
bunch of football players.”

No, personally, we do not think that Duke
will beat Davidson. We've heard about and
seen Wildcat elevens, far inferior to. this
year’s team, which have_defeated_teams-more
powerful than anything Wallace Wade will
be able to trot out this year. And we think
that Dayidson can beat Duke if the Wild-
cats can be aroused to that determination.

Davidson students will be able to see
just how well.Coaches Laird and Mathis

‘Davidson Wildcats Will
Wear Lighter Equipment

New and lighter football equipment will be
| worn by the Wildcats on the gridiron this
| fall. In fact, Coach Newton was so concerned
jin the weight of the uniforms that he had
| them tailored to measure for his best thirty-
five prospects.
| The pants will be made of windblown bal-
| loon cloth, the same kind of goods used in
| making air balloons. The color will be brown,
with a knitted strip of red cloth up the side
| of the legs.
| Jerseys will/be of knit cloth, red in color,
| with black numerals on the back. The same
| jerseys will be worn for all games which the
| Wildcats play>

by snappy Sophomores and reserves who are
exceptionally well drilled in the fundamentals
of the game. Just what Wade’s starting
lineup will be is not known, but he will pre-
sent a team which has already been picked
by Coach Collins of North Carolina Univer-
sity and several prominent sports writers
to win the state champianship.
Duke should put a better drilled eleven on
the field Saturday than should Davidson.
Practice opened at both schoolst on Labor
Day with each holding two practice sessions
a day. Davidson had to reduce its workouts
to one a day after September 8th, when the
Duke, the other hand,
has been able to continue with two sessions
a day, that university does not open
until September 22nd, In addition Coach
Wade has had his style of play installed at

is using for the first time.
