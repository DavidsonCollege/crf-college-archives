Looking for a penny in the sta
dium is a monotonous job. Your
flashlight detects all kinds of things,
yet no pennies. And if you found
one at last, it is bound to be the
3 wrong one and
you start all ov-
er again.

Well, it is fun
after all and it
leaves you a lot
of time to think
about things dif-

a ferent from a
oo penny and ex-
€: cept during ini.

Biedenkopf tiation time also
a littl more important. (Which
does not mean that I am not aware
of the great importance of the pen-
ny as the basic uniwof the Ameri-
can monetary system).

Newspapers at recent times have
been full of stories about the Eng-
lish scientist Dr. Fuchs who is sup-
posed to have given vital atomic
secrets to the Russians. When
questioned in court about his rea-
sons for these acts, that might be
called treason, he is said to have
answered that in his opinion he
had. done a right thing. He person-
ally believed that by enabling the
Russian government’ to build the
A-bomb and maybe even the H.-
bomb, he could help prevent a war
between Russia and America. Both
nations would have the destructive
weapon and thus not dare to at-
tack each other.

Even assuming the fact, that
these really were his motives, an
assumption which is very debatable,
Dr. Fuchs would by no means have
accomplished his purpose. He

Literary Society Dips
50 Years Into Past
To Present Program

Philanthropic Literary Society
meeting Tuesday night was held
amid all the pomp and splendor of
the past age which’ was character-
istic of this group in the year 1870.

The presiding officer and a num-
ber of members dressed sportily in
the costume of that reconstruction
period carried on the business of
the group using the exact style
and manner of speech and action
common in this emotionally aroused
period in the south. The honor and
integrity of two of the post-Civil
War members was threatened in
oratorical expressions which stir-
red the sargeant-at-arms to action.
The unique program, under the di-
rection of Don Shriver, brought to
mind maty interesting and enlight-
ening incidents not uncommon to
the time into which the program
carried the members. The firm foun-
dations of truthfulness, integrity,
and gentlemanly conduct upon
which the Society was founded
were made strikingly clear to all
present in a very interesting and
enjoyable manner.

As the light switch was thrown
by the order of President Dave
Miller, the candles were removed
‘ along with string bow ties and
Phi Society slipped quickly back
into 1950 for the important business
of electing new officers to serve
for the second semester. As the
meeting progressed the most hon-
est of all voting machines point-
ed out that the following members
were elected to the following posi-
tions:

Charles T. Davis—President.

Neil Leach — Vice President..

Tom Stockton — Secretary.

The faithful officers who direct-
ed the Society for the past semes-
ter are certainly to be congratulat-
ed for jobs well done. Pres. Dave
Miller presided in a style which
would make even the 1870 mem-
bers proud. Vice-President Don
Shriver, who served as program
chairman, is especially to be com.
mended for his energetic services.
To Bryan Robinson, who served
during the past few months as
secretary, also is given the Socie-
ty’s vote of gratitude.

The installment of officers will
take place ata called meeting
Tuesday night, Feb. 14, in Phi Hall.
Consideration of suggested men
for membership will be on the
adjenda of the next meeting.

TROTMAN NAMED DIRECTOR OF|F

MASQUERS DOUBLE FEATURE

The director for the forthcoming production of the Red and
Black masquers will be Bill Trotman, a member of the fresh-
man class from Winston-Salem. Bill will be remembered for his
brilliant performance in the role of Senator McKinley in the
Masquers first production of the season, ‘‘John Loves Mary.’’

He is also a member of Eumancan
Literary Society.
This is by no means Bill's first

experience in the field of play direc-|+

ting. While in his senior year at

Reynolds High School he wrote, ;

directed and played the leading
role ig “Bluebeard”, a play for
which he also composed the score.

The play was an outstanding suc- -
cess in Winston-Salem, In addition | ©.

twenty-three other plays
coming to Davidson.

This production, which will be
presented at Davidson on February
27.28, will consist of two one-act
plays, “Sunday Costs Five Pesos”,
and “The Valiant’. The former is
a comedy with a Mexican back-
ground; the latter is a tragedy. It
was the desire of the Masquers in
selecting this production to give
the students something a little bit
different from the regular light com-

edies that have predominated in
past Masquer history. Thus, these
two plays were selected. “The Va-
liant,” the tragedy, has taken its
stand among the classic one act

Ecumenical Meeting
Historical Occasion

The first Ecumenical conference
in the history of Southern Christi-
anity was held in the First Metho-
dist Church on Saturday, Feb. 4.

The conference which began at
10:00 a. m. progressed until 6:00
that evening. This conference was
an outgrowth of the first interna-
tional Ecumenical Conference held
in Lawrence, Kansas, in December,
1948. Curtis Harper of the senior
class represented Davidson at this
first conference. Curtis was the
instigator of creating enough inter-
est on the campus to persuade ten
students to make the trip to Chapel
Hill for the most interesting and
impressive program.

Please. see the Editorial page for
more information on this confer-
ence and the possibilities of such
meetings in our region today.

First Half Ends As Usual; Courses
Hammed, Exams Crammed, Buses Jammed

By PETE MILNER

According to the ancient proverb
of the ancient code of Taft-Ham-
murabi:

“The faculty has eaten sour ex-

am dates,

And the Davidson students’

nerves are set on edge.”

So was it then; so is it now.
Why? Let us project ourselves
back to January 17, 1950, Adjust-
ing the giant 3x2 screen on our
crystal television and time machine
set, let us peer into the last-year-
exam-filled dormitory hovel of any
pre-Exam (Davidson) student. Be-
fore him lies the insurmountable
task of cramming arithmetic 12 A,
Bobbsey Twins Reader 12, and

age:

“Out of sight, out of mind,” Dave
Idson quickly closes his books and
is off to the show to break the ennui
of 30 minutes of concentrated spot-
ting. Dave is now confident that
he is adequately prepared: “Come
hell or high grades.”

Eons drift by, evolutionary pro-
cesses evolute, and empires rise,

Variety Show Raises

Last Wednesday night, Feb. 8,
Chambers Auditorium was the scene
of a Variety Show sponsored by the
Mecklenburg Chapter of the March
of Dimes. Hugo Sapp. Davidson
drive chairman, with the aid of Mr.
Alonzo Squires, as master of cere-
monies “produced” the show for the
town residents and college students
in order to raisé funds for the cam-
paign. The amount of money raised,
being donated by those in the rel-
atively small audience at the show
was in excess of 50° dollars.

The Variety Show, conducted by
Mr. Squires, radio personality who
conducts the popular morning pro-
gram “Breakfast With Squires” .ov-
er station WAYS, in Charlotte, was
begun with Fletcher

of Jinks Jervey, also a freshman

rendering -his popular version of

“Moses and the Peazel Tree.” Mel-
vin Lipe, playing the violin and ac-
companied by Al Neumann follow-
ed next with a bit of h little serious
music — “Ces Czarcas,” by Monte.
As an encore Melvin, who also is
Ist violinist in the Charlotte Sym-
phony played one of his own compo-
sitions, a humorous ditty, “The
Rooster Takes A Stroll.”

The next performance was given
by the emcee Alonzo Squires. Being

dio stars, he gave forth with imita-
tions of such stars as Major Bowes,
Lowell Thomas, Boake Carter,
“Amos & Andy,” Alan (Fatso) Reed
and Fred Allen. He also voiced the
{Sth round of a boxing match be-
tween Joe Louis and Tommy Farr,
broadcast by Clem McCarthy and
Edwin C. Hill.

After this, Jerry Ball, piano vir-
turoso, who recently concluded a
statewide tour for the March of
Dimes, exhibited his pianistic abili-
ties by playing a few arrangements
of his own, biseclis conducting a
musical quiz. Four students, Harry
Hickey, Monty Hill, Grimes Thom-
as, and Jim Carr participated in
this little affair. .

Day after day, students enter class-
es 2 hours ahead of time, wear hea-
vy leather gloves, and carry demi-
johns of ink and myriad blotters
and pens (the latter of which are
guaranteed to write underneath vol-
canoes, in a perfect vacume or at
absolute zero.) Likewise, day af-
ter day, students never finish three-
hour exams in 5 hours, never fail
to raise at least two callouses on
their writing finger (Gad, I wish
I had a finger that could write),
never have enough ink and never
use a ball point pen because they
always fail to write under (6 sleep-

Trouble, however, developed be-

forces and those of the opposing
guerilla troops, and the Alexanders
left China. John attended high
school in Fayetteville and Decateur
and ‘finished’ his junior and. senior
year at Darlington Preparatory
School For Boys. He was saluta-
torian of his graduating class. At
Davidson John plans to major in
either chemistry or physics.

Campbell Steers Eu
For Coming Semester

The Eumanean Literary Society
had its first meeting of the new
semester on the evening of Feb-
ruary 6 at Ew Hall. The prime busi-
ness of the evening, was the seleéc-
tion of new officers for the second
semester. J. W. Campbell was clect-
ed president to succeed Chuck Kir-
by, Tommy Langford was clected
vice-president to succeed Ken
Goodpasture, and Bill Adams was
elected secretary to succeed Shelley
Bard. J. M. Campbell will continue -
to serve as treasurer for the re-
mainder of the scholastic year.

The new officers immediately
took charge of their duties and
proceeded to the next items of busi-
ness. The attendance at meetings
was discussed and plans were laid
to strive for better and more var-
ied programs for the coming year.
The Eumanean is a literary society
which tries to further good writing
and speaking in its members, The
new programs will give members
more active participation in these
in addition to offering them an op-
portunity to become familiar with
the best in literature, declamation,
and oration. The new programs
seem to have already achieved one
of their goals — that of improving
attendance at meetings — since on-
ly four members were absent from
this meeting.

The chapel program given by the
Society before Christmas was com-
mended and Pete Kologvidis was
given hearty approval for his com-
petent direction in helping to put
this program over.

Plans were also made for the se-
lection of new members. Members
are selected on their past achieve.
ments in composition and public
speaking and on their general in-
terest in literary matters, Bids wil
go out this week to those selected
and initiation for the incoming
members will take place at the next
meeting of the society.

The Eumanean has high hopes
of a very successful year under its
new officers and also great expecta-
tion of receiving the top literary
men of the Freshman class as new
members.
