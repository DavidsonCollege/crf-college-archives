Cats stomp all over Southwestern, 56-3

By VAN BECK
Staff Writer

A record rushing attack and
an impressive defense were the
key ingredients this past Satur-
day as Davidson easily defeated
Southwestern at Memphis to
improve its record to 2-1.
Juniors Ray Sinclair and Mick-
ey Dillon shredded the South-
western defense for 347 yards
between them and combined for
five touchdowns. Sinclair’s to-
tal of 222 yards rushing was a
school record as was the of-
fense’s game total of 487 yards.

Sinclair began the offensive
roll with a 68-yard touchdown
dash on the game’s initial play
from scrimmage. Freshman
Wesley Haynes’ successful
PAT made the Wildcat’s lead
7-0, which was as close as the
homestanding Lynxes would
come. Quaterback Brian Whit-
mire scored on a four-yard run
shortly thereafter and Sinclair’s
second score of the day, this one
coming on a 63-yard run, gave
the Cats a 20-0 lead as the first
quarter ended.

Southwestern notched its
only points of the afternoon on a
34-yard field goal early in the
second period but Davidson
quickly responded on a 17-yard
touchdown pass from Whitmire
to tight end James Jones.
Dillon picked up his first score
on a 40-yard pass late in the
quarter and the Wildcats tok a
35-3 lead to the locker room at
the half.

The second half brought more
of the same as the defense
continued its superb overall
showing. Final statistics show-
ed that the Davidson defense
limited Southwestern to a pal-
try eight yards rushing, recov-
ered two fumbles, and pulled in
five interceptions, two by fresh-

University of Alabama at Birm-
ingham, Lynchburg College,
and UNCC, the team upped its
dual-meet record to 6-2.

McManus and Davis took 4th
and 6th places overall with
respective times of 26:28 and
26:43 for the 5 mile course,
while newly-elected captain
Bart Landess secured the 14th
spot with a time of 27:26. Also
commended by coach Sterling
Martin were Jeff Morrow, Jack
Smith, John Rees, and Frank
Ivey.

The women runners lost in a
tough four-way meet to Georgia
State, the University of Ala-
bama, and Wake Forest last
weekend in Charlotte. First
among Davidsonians were

man Keith Ellis who started in
place of injured Kenin Hanna.

Southwestern’s only points

were set up by a ‘Cat fumble in
Davidson territory.

Mickey Dillon scored twice in
the final half, on runs of 70 and
12 yards and freshman Mike
Smith picked up the final
Davidson score of the afternoon
on a run from seven yards out.
For the game Dillon gained 125
yards on 12 carries and caught
two Whitmire passes for 50
yards, overall an outstanding
day for the Huntsville, Ala-
bama junior. Ray Sinclair
vaulted into the nation’s lead in
Division 1AA in rushing with
222 yards and maintained his
scoring lead with two touch-
downs. Brian Whitmire contin-
ued to lead the nation in passing
efficiency following a five for

eight performance against
Southwestern. It might also be
mentioned that Davidson play-
ed without Alvin Atkinson,
Gifford Piercy and Kevin Han-
na, all injured starters.

Coach Ed Farrell commented
on his team’s effort, ‘‘the thing
that pleased nie most last week
was that we had some long
drives with consistent offense.
That was missing in some other
games. We had a great defen-
sive effort. I have felt from the
beginning that we are consider-
ably improved on defense.”’

Next Saturday finds David-
son at home against the always-
tough Bucknell Bisons. Buck-
nell humbled Davidson at Lew-
isburg, Pa. a year ago, but
Saturday’s matchup figures to
be much more evenly matched.

Field hockey gets back
on track with 7-1 win

By ANNE HOCKETT
Staff Writer

The ‘Cats won their first
home game yesterday, annihila-
ting Wake Forest by a score of
7-1. Coach Dee Dee Mayes
called the game ‘‘a great all-
around effort by everyone.”’

Carol Heppner drove the first
goal home during the opening
minutes of the game. Lisa
Ballantyne quickly followed
suit, scoring three more goals to
bring the half-time score to 4-0.
The Wildcat offensive rush did
not lose momentum over the
half. Cathy Inabnet duplicated
Ballantyne’s feat by scoring
three goals during the second
half.

The win yesterday improved

Tamara Foreman(20:12) and
Marian Hill(20:42), followed
closely by Captain Merris Hol-
lingsworth, Melissa Peacock,
and Carrie Nunn. The team
faces Appalachian State this
weekend in Boone, N.C., hop-
ing to improve its 1-5 record.

The men’s team Will also
travel to Boone where they will
face not only the most rugged
course around, but also two
perennially troublesome oppo-
nents, Furman and Appalach-
ian State. The hindrances of
rainy workouts and nagging
injuries will be offset by the
return of Danny Armistead and
a general improving trend on
the part of the entire team,
which is stamping itself as one
of Davidson's best ever.

the Wildcat record to 1-3. The
season began on a disappoint-
ing note as the team dropped
games to Appalachian (1-0) and
James Madison (4-0) on Satur-
day. Those games were not,
however, ‘‘a clear reflection of
the level of play’’ of the team,
according to Mayes.

Regulation time ended in the
Appalachian game with a 0-0
stalemate. Appalachian scored
the winning goal with 2:35 left
to go in the second overtime.
Mayes said she was pleased
with the strong showing against
a Division I team.

Half-time of the Madison
game found both teams score-
less. Freshman wing player
Courtney Hall scored David-
son's only goal to open the
second half. Madison quickly
followed with a score of their
own, and proceeded to control
the rest of the game. Madison
scored three goals, one in the
seconds. Mayes con-
, ‘the last seven minutes
were all theirs.”’

Mayes looks to the rest of the
season with a new optimism.
Mayes noted that ‘‘endurance
has been no problem,” and said
that the offense is passing well
to the open space well and
rushing harder in order to
‘monopolize on goals.”

The defensive squad is com-
posed of new players, with the
exception of Amy Crittenberger
and Beth Davidson, two veter-
an members who played on the

‘offensive last year. But, Mayes

said, ‘‘the squad has pulled
together, playing at the level I
expected to see towards the end

‘of the season.”

Good goalie play has
strengthened the defensive
squad. Cathy Morell returned
to the cage with only one
game's experience. Mitzi Short,
the team trainer, joined the
team ranks during pre-season to
offer support in the goal. Morell
and Short have both worked
hard to learn the difficult skills
of goalkeeper.

Saturday, the ‘Cats play the
Charlotte Flickers at 8:30 and
the Carolina Club at 4:00.
