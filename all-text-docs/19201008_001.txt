Vol. VIII. - DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON. N. C.. OCTOBER 8. 1920. 5
BASKET OAT AKE THREE TRIPS — |Wildcats Hold Generals
~~ Tr to Two Field Goals

The schedule for the basketball
season of 1920-21 has not been com-
pleted, but Manager Miley states
that the Wildcat quintet will make
three trips, one through Virginia.
one through North Carolina, and
one through South Carolina. Ev-
erybody will be glad to hear that
there will probablly be at least eight
or nine games played on the home
floor. We have always had better
luck when playing at home and each
student will have a chance to help
win every one of these eight or nine
games by being present and by giv-
ing the team the utmost support.

Reporters’ Club Begins
Definite Work

Weekly Meeting to be Held—Entrance
Requirements Adopted

The Davidsonian Reporters’ Club
had an important called meeting
Saturday night after the pictures.
This club is composed of students
who have done especially good work
for The Davidsonian in the past.
There are other reporters, but mem-
bership in the Reporters’ club is an
honor given those doing the best
work.

In accordance with the recent re-
quest of the staff that there he a
representative of the club at the
staff meetings, Alex Mitchell, presi-
dent of the club, was chosen for (is
work. The staff is also to have a
representative at the meetings of
the club. This plan is calculated to
promote a fuller co-ordination of
work in the reportorial department
of The Davidsonian, in our determi-
nation to make ours “the best col-
lege weekly in the South.”

The club decided to meet cach
Friday evening at 7:15 in the presi-
dent’s room, for ‘discussion of the
best means of improving the report-
ing.

For the information of men who
are looking forward to membership
in the club, the entrance require-
ments recently adopted by the club
are published herewith. The grad-
ing of the literary quality of the
write-ups will be done by the staff
members, but definite requirements
as to faithfulness and punctuality in
submitting write-ups must be met or
the student will automatically elimi-
nate himself from recommendation
for membership.

“The members are to be chosen
by the club from two groups, as fol-
lows:

“a. A list submitted by The Da-
vidsonian staff. of such students
regularly reporting for The David-
sonian during the year drawing to a
close as have made a record of not
less than 95 per cent in faithfulness
in turning in write-ups on assign-
ments given and not less than 90
per cent in punctuality in turning in
write-ups by the time specified. (The
department editors shall show “on
time” or “late” or some other suit-
able designation on the check sheet
of assignments, with provision for
excuses being given by the depart-
ment editors for unavoidable de-
lays).

“b. A list composed of men regu-
larly reporting for The Davidsonian
during the year drawing to a close
as have made a record of not less
than 95 per cent in faithfulness in
turning in write-ups on assignments
given and not less than 90 per cent
in punctuality in turning in write-

Davidson Honored by Handsome

Visit of Major Mueller

Popular Ex-Commandant Returns to
See Former Charges

Last week the student body had a
pleasant surprise in the visit of no
less a personage than Captain, now
Major, A. H. Mueller, who for the
last two years was commandant and
Professor of Military Science and
Tactics of the R. O. T. C. on the Hill.
It was a familiar sight to the up-
per classmen to see the “Colonel,”
as he has always been called, back
once more on the campus, and ev-
eryone was more than glad to have
him with us again. His well-known
voice and figure have been missed
very much this year by the soldiers
of the local army, and his presence
again forcibly reminded them and
others of the many bloodless battles
and marches made during the cam-
paigns of last winter and spring.
Though making no talk to the bat-
talion as a whole, he received the
officers at headquarters and present-
ed his felicitations to them there.
During the course of the conversa-
tion he spoke of the present com-
mandant, Captain Hearn, in’ the
highest terms possible. Major Muel-
ler was en route from Henderson-
ville to Fort Oglethorpe, and as his
road lay through Charlotte, he could
not resist the trip here to see how
things were getting along this year.
He was a spectator on the parade
ground Wednesday morning and
watched with interest the efforts of
his former charges.

Captain Mueller was promoted to
the rank of major on the Ist of last
July. During the summer months
he was commanding officer of the
R. O. T. C. Cavalry Camp, Ethan
Allen, in New Hampshire. His regu-
lar station is now at Fort Ogle-

Memorial to!
Gen. Davidson at |
Hopewell

Grave of Revolutionary Hero at Last
’ Properly Marked

{

On the evening of September 29,!
at Hopewell Church, 11 miles from!
Charlotte on the Beatty’s Ford road, |
a large gathering attended the im-
pressive ceremonies at the dedica-
tion of a beautiful bronze memorial
tablet erected to the memory of
Gen, William Lee Davidson, by the
Mecklenburg Chapter of the Amer-
ican Daughters of the Revolution.

General Davidson served carly in
the Revolutionary War as major of
the Fourth Regiment of North Caro-
lina troops. He was later promated
to licutenant-colonel, and was se-
verely wounded at Calson’s Mill.
After recovery he was promoted for!
bravery to the rank of brigadier-
general. In the battle of Cowan's
Ford he, with 300 men, stood against
Cornwallis and his troops, and there
en February 1, 1781, he gave his life
for the cause of liberty and for his
country. His body was buried by
torchlight in Hopewell cemetery by
his friends, Richard Barry and David
Wilson, who also took part in the
skirmish with the enemy. Here in
the central part of the cemetery the
handsome granite monument, with
bronze tablet attached, has been
placed.

Up to this time the grave has been
unmarked, and the movement to
suitably honor the memory of Gen-
eral Davidson was started by the
Mecklenburg Declaration of Inde-
pendence Chapter. The North Caro-
lina Historical Commission con-
tributed liberally toward the ecrec-
tion of the monument, and with con-
tributions from individual members
of the family, a handsome monu-
ment was secured.

1921 Quips and Cranks

Placed on Firm Fi-
nancial Basis

Students Vote Appreciable Increase
for Best Annual Ever

Failing to obtain additional funds
for the 1921 Quips and Cranks by a
petition to the custodians of the
blanket fee, the Annual management
took things in their own hands and
called a meeting of the student body
last Tuesday morning to put their
proposition before the students. C.
Ht. Long, editor-in-chief of the 1921

| Quips and Cranks, and C. M. Mc-

Caskill, business manager, conduct-
ed the meeting. Mr. Long stated
the object of the meeting and told
the students of the plans whereby
the 1921 Quips and Cranks will be
the best Annual in the history of the
college. Mr. McCaskill then told
the students of the funds necessary
for the issuing of the proposed An-
nual. He stated that insufficient
funds were on hand to give David-
son College the Annual as outlined
by Mr. Long, and unless more funds
were subscribed, the students would
have to content themselves with an
inferior Annual. To provide the
funds necessary, Mr. McCaskill ask -
ed that each student pledge himself
tu pay $3 to the Annual management
at the opening of the spring term.
The students wére heartily in favor
of Mr. McCaskill’s plan and it was
adopted by a unanimous vote of the
student body.

Hitherto the policy has been that
each student pay a certain amount
through the blanket fee and then
pay an additional sum for each pic-
ture they had in the Annual. This
made the Annual cost some students
Under
the new arrangement each student
has an equal share in the Annual and
in its cost.

Both Teams Impregnable on Defensive
—Capt. Hammett Stars for Losers

Two field goals on the par: of
Silverstein sent the Wildcats down
in defeat at‘the hands of Washing-
ton and Lee. The game was hard
fought and although devoid of thrills
was featured by the spectacular de-
fensive work on both sides,

The Gencrals threatened to score
on several occasions, but. could not
break through the Wildcat defense.
Although never in a position to
score, the Wildcats experienced the
same difficulty in ground gaining.
The winners’ chance to score their
field goals was a result of superior
punting. On every exchange of
punts the Generals gained an ad-
vantage of 10 yards or more.

The work of Mattox, playing full-
back for the winners, featured. This
Roanoke lad penetrated the Red and
Black line for the only appreciable
gains made by the Generals. Al-
though he was used time and again,
he stood up well under the offensive
and rarely failed to deliver a gain.

Silverstien also played a star
‘ame for the winners. His punting
was of rare variety and his toe saved
the day. Two neatly laid field goals
from the 30 and 20 yard lines respec-
tively, gave Washington and Lee
enough to win.

For Davidson the superb playing |
of Captain Hannnett featured. The
big boy was in all the plays and suc-
ceeded in breaking up the Generals’
aerial attack: McFadden and Mas-
sev were the chief ground gainers
in the Red and Black back field. Cas-
sell had the misfortune of getting
his bad shoulder hurt again, and was
forced to retire from the game in
the first few nrinutes of play.

The game began with Cassell
kicking off and Washington and Lee
returned the ball about 10 yards. A
series of line plunges carried the
ball te the Wildcats’ 10 yard line.
Here the line stiffened, however, and
the ball was lost on downs. Navid-
son failed to gain, however, and
punted to mid-field. Washington and
Lee advanced to a position for a field

goal. Silverstein attempted and
failed. Davidson: lost the ball on
downs and Washington and Lee

again placed the ball in position for
a try for a field goal. Silverstien
sailed it true this time and the quar-
ter ended 3 to O in Washington and
Lee’s favor.

The second quarter was played in
mid-field, neither side being able to
gain ground through the line. Wash-
ington and Lee opened up‘an aerial
attack but abandoned it after Shep-
