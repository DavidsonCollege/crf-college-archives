Shearer Biblical Hall
Loses Status To Axe

By BILL MOSS

To ene‘not well versed in Davidson’s ivy-draped
traditions, it'might seem strange that amidst the great!
jubilation accompanying the announcement of plans for
the John R. Cunningham Fine Arts Center, there is a
decided note of sadness among many students.

“If we are ‘to achieve jhe
American Dream we ‘must pro-
vide for the future education
of all students that merit it.”

In regard to status on cam-
pus, Packard said that students
are not moved: to specific pat-
terns of actions or dress just
by the desire to conform, but
because they wish to copy those
that they emulate. .

On the campus, as in other
facets of life, Packard stressed
the ‘need of. an understanding
of ourselves and others so that
we may be able to live in our
society free from the anxieties
that are engendered by status
seeking.

of the room by a short, parti-

and a shelf suitable for a ra-
dio or phonograph have been
proposed for the area opposite
the lavatory. Final decision
concerning this area awaits
cost estimates; however, there
will probably be at least a
shelf.

Next to the lavatory arca
and on opposite sides of the
room will be placed two wall
units. Each unit will include
a wardrobe, four drawers, a
small cabinet and additional
storage area at the top.

The beds in each room will
fit between the wall unit and
the desks at the end of the
room, parallel to the wall. This
“built-in” effect is a major
change from the present dormi-
tories where beds project into
the middie of the room with
their heads at the walls. .

vided.

The desks will be formica-
topped and cach will have a
flourescent lamp. The area un-
der the desk will either be
wood or will be painted with a
seuff-resistant color.

Currie pointed out that the
main changes in room arrange-
ment from the patterns now
followed in Belk and Little
Dormitories will be in shelf
space and location of the beds.

The building will have four
levels as seen from the Belk
side and five as seen from the
Fraternity Court side. At pres-

.ent no rooms are scheduled

for the basement. This area will
be used for additional storage
space and to provide a bar-bell
room for student use.

REAL COLUMNS

There will be three en-
trances, each of which will be
sheltered by a portico. The
columns at the front of the
building will be real.

The lobby will be furnished
with natural-finish furniture in
a manner similar to that of
Belk. ;

Construction began in July
and the building is scheduled
for completion by next July.
