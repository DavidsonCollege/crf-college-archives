Stephen Curry °10 was off
crutches Tuesday, after an awk-
ward landing in Saturday’s vic-
tory over Furman left him with
a sprained left ankle. His status
is day-to-day, according to Head
Coach Bob McKillop in a press
release.

“I’m feeling better,”
told the Charlotte Observer.

While driving to the basket,
Curry stepped on the foot of Fur-
man’s Noah States and rolled
his ankle. Curry sat out the final
nine minutes of the game with ice
wrapped around his ankle.

X-rays on Sunday showed
that the injury was merely an

ankle-sprain, not something more
serious like a fracture or torn lig-
ament.

Curry did not practice on
Monday or Tuesday, though he
did take part in a workout on
Tuesday, the press release said.

It remains unclear whether the
nation’s leading scorer will play
in tonight’s game against The
Citadel at 7 p.m. The Bulldogs
have won nine straight games
including a road- victory over
College of Charleston, who re-
cently beat Davidson. The ’Cats
are also gearing up for Saturday’s
BracketBuster showdown. with
No. 21 Butler.

According to wee:

whether Curry plays will be *
game-time decision.”

If this season has been about
overcoming mental obstacles, the
’Cats jumped their tallest hurdle
last Saturday when they beat UT-
Chattanooga for the first time in as
long as anyone could remember.
After twenty minutes against UTC,
the home team led by 12, and even-
tually pulled out an 89-80 win in
overtime.

With the Pink Zone fund-
raiser for breast cancer research, a
pumped student section poured into
the stands. It would be the next to
last game for Mandy Halbersleben
709 and Mercedes Robinson °09.
Not to mention, the ’Cats were
hungry to avenge an earlier loss to
the Mocs.

Whatever the expectations, Da-
vidson came out on fire. Coming

The Davidson basketball team
collected a pair of conference victo-
ries last week, but may have paid a
severe price for their success as star
guard Stephen Curry ’10 sprained
his left ankle in the second half of
Saturday’s 75-60 victory over Fur-
man. Last Thursday, the Wildcats
knocked off Wofford 78-61.

Curry had 25 points in Satur-
day’s game before leaving midway
through the second half.

The Wildcats held a 60-55 lead
when Curry left the game. Despite
a ragged offensive performance in
which Davidson made only three
field goals and only eight of sixteen
foul shots over the game’s final
eight minutes, the Wildcat defense
held Furman to five points over the
same period to secure the victory.

Stephen Rossiter ’10 recorded
a double-double with 10 points
and 11 rebounds, while front court
mate Andrew. Lovedale 09 nar-
rowly missed equaling the accom-
plishment with 13 points and nine
rebounds. Brendan McKillop ’11
recorded 10 points, including sev-
en foul shots over the game’s final
minutes to salt away the victory.

to make the game more competi-
tive. In fact, Furman closed the first
half on a 9-0 run to claim a 36-35
lead at the intermission.

Davidson recaptured the lead
early in the second half and ex-
panded their lead to seven with ten
minutes to play.

After Curry left, defensive spe-
cialist Max Paulhus Gosselin ’09
nailed a huge three-pointer with
three minutes to play to give Da-
vidson a 68-57 lead and finally put
the pesky Paladins away.

Player of the Week 3

Sam O’Hair ‘o9
WRESTLING
ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA

The senior wrestler won all three of his matches over
the weekend including a 13-4. decision in the 184 division
while competing for the final time in Belk Arena as the
Wildcats fell to SoCon rival Citadel in their final home
match of the season Sunday. With his performance,
O’Hair earned Socon Wrestler of the Week honors.

Jordan Miller led Furman with
20 points, while Bryson Barnes
added 17.

Last Thursday’s win over Wof-
ford proved to be a tough’ chal-
lenge, in spite of the final score, as
Davidson sought to rebound from
its first conference defeat in nearly
two years.

With just under eight minutes to
play, a Tim Johnson lay-up pulled
Wofford within one at 60-59. With
a hostile crowd roaring for their
downfall, the Wildcats answered

the bell. Bryant Barr *10 drilled a
triple on the next trip down, Curry
followed with a three on the next
possession, and the ’Cats continued
the momentum for the remainder of
the game, finishing on an 18-2 run.

Curry led the charge for the
Wildcats, recording 39 points.
Lovedale tallied 10 points to go
with his nine rebounds, and Paul-
hus Gosselin added nine points.

The Terriers started the game
on fire, jumping out to an 11-2 lead.
After weathering a half-court three
by Jason Dawson, the Wildcats
managed to inch their way closer,
drawing within 41-36 at halftime.
Triples by Barr, Paulhus Gosselin
and Curry to begin the second half
sparked a 19-4 run.

Despite being down 55-45, the
Terriers refused to fold and respond-
ed with a 14-5 run of their own that
culminated with Johnson’s lay-up.
At this point, the Wildcats put the
throttle down and pulled away for
the hard-earned victory.

The twin victories improve Da-
vidson’s record to 22-4 and 15-1 in
the Southern Conference.

Wednesday’s game against The
Citadel will begin at 7 p.m., while
Saturday’s contest against Butler
will tip at noon and be broadcast
nationally on ESPN. Both contests
will take place in Belk Arena.

paint. On the back of her 50-percent
shooting from behind the arc, the
Wildcat offense could drive the ball
at will. Lob after lob inside to Rob-
inson and Julia Paquette ’10 stifled
the Mocs’ aggressive defense.

Where the ’Cats outplayed
UTC in the first half, they simply
outlasted them in the second. The
Mocs earned bonus free-throw
shooting with 12 minutes left in the
game. Alex Thompson 710 had to
sit nearly the rest of the half with
four fouls.

Slowed tremendously, the
game became a knock-down drag-
out grudge match. UTC hit 44 per-
cent of its shots, adding to 14 of
17 shooting from the free-throw
line. Yet every time the Mocs nar-
rowed the lead, even pulling ahead
at times, Davidson responded with
utmost composure. After a miracle
three with five seconds left, UTC’s
star shooter sent the game to over-
time.

The ’Cats shot a perfect six
for six in the final period. Includ-
ing stellar outside shooting from
Ashley Lax °10, Davidson landed
a stamina-fueled stomp against an
athletic Chattanooga squad. As the
Wildcat defense refused to make it
close, the home team pulled it out
89-80.

Though UTC held the upper
edge in athleticism and depth, Da-
vidson made up for it with pure
endurance. “We never really have
speed,” Halbersleben said. “But
we are in shape better than other
teams, so we can run with them.
Then on our offense, in transition,
we can wear them out.” In the end,
those extra sprints in practice gave
the ’Cats the edge needed to secure
