NC Republican

By HEYWARD CARTER

Davidsonian Feature Editor

State H ouse Minority
Leader James B. Holshous-
er presented Monday in
chapel what was perhaps
the only politically-oriented
speech of the entire year
which was not greeted at
some point by cheers, boos,
or cat-calls.

Perhaps the major reason for
the acceptance of, not indiffer-
ence to, Holshouser’s talk was
that it was not, in his words,
“part of any holy crusade’’ but
simply an outline and summary
of *‘politics in general and North
Carolina polities in particular.”

Obviously Holshouser did not
intend to be bipartisan, but he
also did not intend to engulf his
audience in the morass of per-
sonal opinion and sentimentality
which it has learned to expect
from politicians in general.

The major theme of Holshous-
er’s talk was suggested by Lt.
Gov. Robert Scott in a speech
delivered recently at Wake. For-
est College in which he stated
that the Republican party in
North Carolina was growing to
such an extent that it was, un-
der the right circumstances,
“able to give ‘em (the Demo-
crats) a fit. " ;

Holshouser maintains that
North Carolina is ‘‘now truly a
bi-party state,"’ as is evidenced
‘by the large number of “near
misses’ it encountered in the

Goldiere Services
Conducted Today

Funeral services were held
this morning for Dr. Augustin
Goldiere, retired Davidson pro-
fessor of French, at 11 a.m. in
the College Presbyterian Church. !

Goldiere died at his home
Wednesday morning.

Goldiere taught at Davidson
for 40 years. interrupted only by
two years during World War II.

A native of Massachusetts,
Goldiere received his AB from
Dartmouth College and his MA‘
and PhD from Yale University.

He was a member of Omicron
Delta Kappa. the American As-|
sociation of Teachers of French
and Spanish, the South Atlantic
Modern Language Association’
and the American Association of '
University Professors.

He is survived by his wife.

After Vespers Open House

The following professors will hold open house. for

1964 elections.

Although 1961 was an eNx-
tremely bad year for the Repub-
lican party nationally, ‘‘North
Carolina Republicans actually
gained ground over their show-
ing in 1960." Bob Gavin. Hol-
shouser pointed out, polled over
600,000 votes in the recent elec-
tion—over 200.000 more than any
other Republican candidate for
governor before him.

In addition, Jonas and Broy-
hill, North Carolina's two Re-
publican congressmen, had sur-
prisingly easy wins in 1964,
whereas in 1962 the majority for
each was slight. Besides these
major Republican victories, a
good number of agonizingly
close defeats were experienced
in many districts formerly solid-
ly Democratic.

According to Holshouser, *‘The
most significant result of the
1964 election in North Carolina
is also the most overlooked—the
substantial increase in the num-
ber of Republican county com-

missioners elected. When a par-
ty starts winning these (local)
races... it won't be long be-
fore that party has one of its

members occupying the gover- |

nor’s mansion. And at the grass
roots level North Carolina Re-
publicans came out stronger
than ever.”

The key to the Republican
gains in North Carolina are
thought by Holshouser to lie in
the changing face or image of
the North Carolina Republican
party. The party is now describ-
ed best “by adding the word
‘progressive’ in front of the word
‘conservatism’.

“Republicans in North Caro-
lina are becoming more and
more willing to suggest new
approaches to problems facing
our state, to no longer just sit
back and Iet sorneone else do it,
to be a party of doers.’ Ex-
amples of this are Republican
backing of North Carolina min-
imum wage laws and higher
education improvements.

HOLSHOUSER CRACKS A FUNNY ONE
Republican's Speech Not All Serious

CAMPUS SCENES f

Field Discusses Poetry,
Muses On Life As Poet

By TED GLUSMAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

- The last time a poet visit-
ed Davidson, he said this
was “the deadest place I’ve
been.” Either Davidson has
changed, or poets are a va-
ried breed, for Edward
Field, winner of the Lamont
Poetry Award for 1962,
spent three days here, and
commented. “This is the

‘most interesting college I've

visited recently.” By the
same token. Davidson’s re-
action to Field was propor-
tionately more excitement
and interest.

Friday night was -the only
chance most students had for
contact with Field. whose book
Stand Up, Friend, With Me had
been featured for several days
in the student store, and the
reading was very well-attended.

‘In fact. some fifty people
heard Field read from his own
work, including such poems as
“Mark Twain and Sholem Al-
eichem,”” “The. Bride of Frank-

| enstein” (based on the movie).

a Bo a.

and “An Ode Por Ookie.”” The
poet's Jewish accent and his in-
clusion of numerous personal
notes on the poems contributed
to an excellent reception of the
man by itis audience.

About thirty of the interested
listeners remained behind after
the formal reading to hear Field
comment on various aspects of
his life and work. He told pros-
ective poets, “The only way I
ever got anything published was
by pull!" He added that his book
had been turned down by no less
than twenty-two publishers.

Field told his eager audience
about his visit to Greece, which

he said had a tremendous effect .

on his poetry, and described his
own poetry as “different from
verse." Poetry, he said, is larg-
er than verse, and less restrict-
ed.

Unfortunately, Field was not
scheduled for another reading
here, but since he was not due
at his next engagement till Man-
day, he spent the week-end on
campus, taking long walks with
students and by himself, and
thinking. Commented one of his
“disciples,” “He spent a good

deal of his time alone.*' He was
described as a “complete indi-
vidualist.””

For instance, he eats flowers.
That’s right, eats Mowers. Mus-
ed a companion, “If a flower
looks good, he just eats it.”
Field spent the better part of
one of tliose long walks teach-
ing two of his fellow-travelers
which flowers are good and
which are not. Wildflowers are!
often very sweet, it seems, but!
dogwood is bitter. “It burns.”
complained Field, who express-

will be increased by $100 for the
incoming Freshman Class mak-
ing thei rtotal tuition’ $1,100. It
has beerr a policy of the college
for the last several years not to
increase the tuition of students
once they have enrolled. Thus
all uppercfassmen will continue
to pay their present tuition with
no increase.

In announcing the increase in
fees Currie pointed gut that it
has been three years since room

and laumdsy fees have Seen rals-
ed. Begimming with the school
year 1962-1963 they were raised
from $170 t $200 and from $65
to $75, respectively... The last
change in board was made four
years ago in 1961-1962.

AUXILIARY OPERATIONS

Currie explained the increased
rates in non-tuition fees by say-
ing that the cost of operating
“auxiliary operations”: rises ev-
ery’year. Rather than increase
the’ fees each year “at a $3.95
bargain rate’ the college peri-

odicailly adjusts the rates to
meet the increased costs.

The janitors have received a
raise im each of the eight years
that Currie has been at David-
son. It is to be expected that
room fees must be increased
regularly to meet the increased
cost of operation for the dormi-
tories.

The increased board fee re-
sults from an agreement be-
tween the college and Slater
Food Service. The college re-
ceives a proportiomal part of the
fees to cover college costs. Cur-
rie stated that “we furnish all
base stock equipment, all major
cleaning, lights, water, heat,
and gas, as well as take care of
all repair and replacement of
cafeteria equipment.”

SOCIAL FEE
No fee has been set for next

‘year as a social fee. Currie sur-

mised that it would be listed
separately rather than as a part
of the general fee. Since it is an
extra expense, for scholarship
purposes it should be considered
separate from the general fee.

When: asked about a possible
salary increase for student work-

ers Cunrie replied that student
salaries “are not considered in

light of what students pay in

fees of operation, but rather in
light of inflation and job rates
on campus, in town, and in the
area.”

Currie said that the college
wanted to be as fair as possible
in any and all increases, but
that costs do rise and the col-
lege has to meet expenses.
