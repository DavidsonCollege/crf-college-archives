Athletics dwarf Academics

By JASON NOBLES
Staff Writer

Frequently, complaints by
members of the student body
arise concerning the misdirec-
tion of funds by this schools
administration.

One of the more frequent
complaints concerns the ex-
penditures of the athletic de-
partment. In the public
budget for 1975-76, the
athletic department was listed
as $509,644. But $618,818 was
finally allocated to the depart-
ment and though this number
includes salaries, it does not
include game expenditures
chich can be estimated at
$250,000-$300,000. As for
figures concerning basketball
and football alone, the ad-
ministraiton did not disclose
these.

The 1975-76 expenses for
academic areas was listed
$123,723 (this figure encom-
passing those items listed as
departmental, _laboratories,
language lab, and music
department) or approximately
14.6 percent of the total
athletic department.

The reason given for this
direction of funds is in part
found in the minutes of the
trustees meeting in February
1976:

“Recognizing that a nation-
al level basketball program
has raised the Visibility of

Davidson College across the
nation, has promoted excellent
school spirit among the stu-
dent body, and has evoked
generous financial response
from alumni and friends, the
trustees of Davidson College
strongly reaffirm the commit-
ment of the college to a
national level intercollegiate
basketball program.”’

Carnegie guest house is
another sore spot. According
to comptroller Davidson, the
money used for renovating the
guest house could have been
directed to the academic areas
{rather than being funds speci-
fically given for renovation).
The reasoning behind the
guest house, accoding.to Dr.
Spencer, is that, as with other
cosmetic effects, it enhances
the general atmosphere.

Visitors would therefore feel
more comfortable with the
school and thus more apt to
fork over some green. As for
the brick sidewalks, in the
long run they cost less as they
need less repair work than
would asphalt.

Meanwhile the biology
department budget hasn't
risen in three years (though it
doubled over the past five)
while the number of majors
has tripled and inflation for
supplies is at a 25 percent rate.
In fairness to the administra-

tion it should be that a

list.

national science foundation
grant was matched by the
college which helped in pur-
chasing the mobile lab.
Looking at the other sciences,
chemistry has nearly tripled in
five years but it too has been
nearly leveled for three years.
Physics has been the most
neglected, basically unin-
creased over five years; this
year it still recieved $1300 less
than requested. The interna-
tional education funds were
cut by 33 percent.

Of the professors quest-
ioned, the majority mentioned
an obvious need for more
funds, money that could be
used for items such as outside

_ Speakers, and more A.V.

(especially for the languages),
to external examiners and
standardized tests. Several
raised doubts concerning the
direction of funds towards
athletics.

Martin science building is
another area of conflicting
views. While the school
spends money renovating
IMAC fields and installing 18
kw. radio station, Martin
remains in a relatively stag-
nant condition. The rationale
for this, as told to me by Dr.
Spencer, is that by waiting
until enough money has been

collected to as to fix it up in
one shot, it’s not worth the
effort as various construction
would elsewise have to be done
twice due to piecemenal reno-
vation.

As to why they can’t save
the money that was used for,

say, the IMAC fields is that

this is part of the operating
budget and therefore, ac-
cording to comptroller David-
son, if not used within the year
it must be listed as a profit.

I don’t believe it should be
thought that the administra-
tion is out to keep academics
at a minimum for the sake of
other areas. Mellon grants of
$150,000 and $230,000 have
been approved specifically. for
faculty and program develop-
ment. Various other grants
have also been directed to-
wards the academics. The
Booth Ferris grant helped in
creating the new gallery and
has also given the school its

system of computer terminals. —

However it does appear to
me that the academic areas do
not recieve an appropriate
share of the budget. Davidson
College is supposed to be a
learning institution and not a
sports camp or holiday inn
with a liberal arts education as
a fringe benefit.

know about that.”

The top priority major ex-
penditures are funded through
funds brought into the college

’ from gifts and fund raising.

“You take these (top). prior-
ities,’ said Spencer. “If the
money coming in were all

oi completely unrestricted you

would have to make a deter-
mination of where the money
would be spent.

“The realities of fund rais-
ing are that if you have

projects as diverse as those
that you try to identify pros-
pects interested in those and
you go out and try to revise
the money for that.

‘Priority as to which one
gets built first may well be
established by getting the
interest of somebody willing to
get the project on the road in a
big way,” he said.

The college tries to raise
money for all four areas at
once, according to Vice Presi-
dent for Development Duane
A. Dittman. ‘There isn’t one

of those projects we don’t have
proposals for,’’ he said.

By setting one specific top
priority the college would be
shutting off possible revenues,
according to Dittman. |

“If we said the Martin
Science Building is the only
priority we have we couldn't
look for money for the arts
building,’’ he said. ‘‘That’s
one reason we don’t have a
priority list.”

“Usually it doesn’t happen
that someone comes and takes
the initiative to come and give

money to (4 Specific: project) ,”’
said Spencer. ‘‘We take the
initiative to 80 to these people
and ask if they would be
willing to donate to these
projects.”

The college does not try to. |
get people who offer to finance
projects that are not top
priority to finance the more
important Projects because
‘people want to make their
biggest impact in their name
to things they love,” said
Dittman.
