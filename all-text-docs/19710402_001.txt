Halts ‘Groove Tube’ Show

The Executive Committee
‘of the union’ board decided
Monday to halt the showing
of the film ‘Groove Tube”
after its first run.

The decision caused some-
thing- of a stir in the union
building. According to junior
Mark Meza, a petition to
reverse the decision collected

over 150 signatures in 15
minutes. :
Lester Strong, president

of .the college union and
chairman of the executive
committee, said in‘ an inter-
view Tuesday that the com-
mittee had ‘‘misled itself’
as to the content of the
film, in deciding to book
the movie at Davidson. He
said that certain sexually
explicit scenes made the
movie ‘‘not the kind of thing
which the executive com-
mittee wanted to promote as
entertainment.

‘In other words,” he said,
‘the committee simply did
not want to associate itself

with gross movies by pro-
moting them “as. a_ union
function. Sex was not our
objection. But the sex hand-
led in this film does not
measure up to be shown as
‘entertainment’ according to
the aims and principles of
the college community.”
When questioned about the
role of C. Shaw Smith, di-
rector of the College Union,
in making the decision, both

Smith and Strong empha-
sized that the committee
made the, decision’ on _ its

own.

“Mr. Smith asked for a
meeting to discuss the
movie’, “said Strong, ‘‘but

the first to suggest cancelling

it was myself. ‘Mr. Smith
acts only in an advisory ca-
pacity to our board, and has
no veto EONer over our de-
cisions.”’

Smith confirmed these
statements, adding that he,
too, had misunderstood the
nature of the film, and was
originally very glad to be
able to book the film at the
union. Union films are not
ordinarily previewed before

' their showing.

As result of the meeting
Tuesday afternoon, the film
was cancelled. The meeting
was attended by Smith,

Senate Votes To Back
Off-Campus Eating ©

By ALEC HOON
News Editor

The student Senate in its -

meeting Monday night gave
a controversial. endorsement
to fraternity bid to -petition
the trustee social cdommit-
tee to revoke the section of
their decision on fraternities

, Sieh aly them tg operate

iving or dining facilities off
campus,

“The decision to support the
fraternities’ proposal passed
by a Senate vote of 11-6
after more than an hour of
heated debate.

But Senate President’ Dan-
ny« Clodfelter was quick to
add that ‘‘the senate’s ac-
tion in no way means that
student government intends
to abandon suppert for the
new social system.”

The ‘proposal is. now on

the agenda of the trustees -

cision. Strong, as chairman
of the union board, broke the
tie and cast thedeciding vote
in* favor of the executive
committee decision.

Campus and Social Life Com-
mittee meeting set for May
13,

The part of the decision in

~ question is section 7, which

States: ‘Any fraternity which
wishes to leave Patterson
Court and have its meetings
elsewhere may do so, so
long as_ its’ meeting place
does not include the opera-
tion of living or dining facili-
ties.”

Under the ieadership of
David Grissett, the sénate-
appointed Fraternity Mobili-
zation Committee, seeking
some solution for the frater-
nities who refused to accept
the college’s new plan, drew
up a four point compromise
proposal.

The ‘proposal would. give
the houses moving off cam-
pus the right to maintain
living and dining facilities,
be subject to no unnecessary
fees, and be able to partici-
pate in such student organi-
zations as the intramural
athletic program.

When Grissett brought the .

plan to the senate floor for
approval, he met vocal op-
position, mainly from sena-
tors Mark Meza, Jody Turn-
er, and Cecil Burney, who
felt that acceptance of the
proposal would be detriment:

al to the chances of the new
system.

Meza’ said, “It. defeats
everything we have been
working for ‘or the last ten
years, and especially the last
three.”

“It will be a thorn in: the -
side of the new social sy-
stem,”

The main point of conten-
tion was the clause stating
that fraternities “retain the,
use of college facilities, ex:
cluding that of the Patterson
Court house as a fraternity
house, as duly chartered stu-
dent organizations, and re-
main as participants in other

student organization _pro-
grams such as_ intramural
sports.”

After much debate, a mo-

“tion to “delete this section

passed by a vote of 9-5,

Debate continued on the
remainder of the plan with
Senate Vice President Bill
Alexander and_ freshman
senator Bill Ralston being
the most vocal proponents.

“This. bill only gives fra-
ternities the right to go off
Campus; theré are no new
rights involved,’ said Alex-
ander. ‘

“It gives all individuals

Financial Squeeze Is On

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

A critical financial squeeze
is primarily responsible for
the increases in tuition, room
and board for next year, ac-
cording to Vice President of
Finance and. Development C.
David Cornell.

Commenting on_ specific
reasons for the hike in costs,
Cornell said, ‘‘The budget
picture is so tight, we just
had to make certain in-
creases,”

Cornell cited a number of
reasons for ~the $235 in-

crease in tuition and fees. -

‘Some of this money will be
used to maintain faculty
salaries,” he said, ‘‘while
another part of this sum
will be used to absorb the
increased costs of general
materials.

‘Library costs have just
rocketed with 10 percent in-
creases a year. Since the
library is essential to the
operation of a good college,
a portion of this tuition in-
crease will be routed in this
direction,” he said.

Cornell also noted that Da-
vidson is ‘‘very dependant’

‘on revenue from its endow-

ment. Because of the general
economic situation, however,
the college is not longer re-
ceiving as much from its
endowment as it used to.

That the college will lose
approximately $30,000 on the
cafeteria service this year
is the reason for the $50
increase in the board fee,
according to Cornell.

Expenses for employment
of Slater Food Service -and
maintenance of kitchen faci-
lities total approximately
$195,000 a year. However, the
college only grossed $157,500
on the sale of meal tickets.
' “Obviously the college can-
not afford a $30,000 deficit;
consequently, the board in-
crease of $50 is an attempt
to break even on the food
service,” he said. ‘‘Com-
pounding the problem is the
terrific price of staple food
items. Wholesale costs have
gone out of sight.”

Cornell said the cafeteria
service was competitive in
price with other schools as
well as with local eating es-
tablishments.

Inflation, renovations and
wage increases account: for
the $50 increase in room
rent.

“We have not had an in-
crease in room rent for two
years, said Cornell. *‘With a

steady inflationary: factor of *

4-5 percent, $30 of the $50
increase will be eaten up by
inflation alone.

“The demand of recent
generation of students for
more of the amenities of

life is responsible for money
needed for dorm renovations.
The student emphasis on
dorm remodeling has been
more acute in the past four
years than was the case pre-
viously,

“‘We have, therefore, had
to increase the fund for re-
novation -and reburnishing
dormitories. A portion of
the $50 room rent increase.
will be added to this fund.

“The coming year will be
a critical one financially,”
Cornell said. '‘We will -have
to review our goals and ob-
jectives as well as look for
ways of increasing our ef-
ficiency.”
