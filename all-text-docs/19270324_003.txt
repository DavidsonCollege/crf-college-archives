Is their powder puff’s on the wrong end.

Camel is its own reason for success

THERE is just one reason why
Camel is the most popular smoke
in all the world—why it leads in
favor all cigarettes of all time.

It is the one cigarette that will
stand up all day and as far into the
night as you care to go. You can
smoke one or a niillion in daylight
or dark and Camels will never tire
your taste or leave a cicaretty
after-taste.

TOBACCO COMPANY,

R. J. REYNOLDS

©1927

Camels are rolled of such choice
tobaccos, are so skilfully blended
that there simply can be no better
cigarette made.

And that stands, regardless of
the price you pay.

If you want the choice of the
world’s experienced smokers, the
mellowest mildness that ever came

from a cigarette—
‘Have a Camel!’
