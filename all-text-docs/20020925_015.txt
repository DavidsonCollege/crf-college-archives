Men’ S Cross country fights
adversity to place third

By WALKER SAIK
Staff Writer

A victory would have been nice, but a
little racing as just good enough.

This weekend, the men’s cross-country team
took the great weather and flat courses at the
Winthrop Invitational and transformed them
into both a fun time and a third place finish out
of nine competing schools, just 12 points
behind second place UNC-Asheville.

The team had hoped to earn its first win
since 1999, but the arrival of High Point’s “A”
team, which dominated the field with a score
of 20 points, coupled with the absence of four
runners, including two of the Wildcats’ top
seven finishers in their last race, turned the
third place finish into a grand display of depth.

“Tf this meet shows nothing else, it dem-
onstrates our great sense of depth,” head coach
Gary Andrew explained. “With four runners
missing today, the other guys really stepped it
up.”

The Wildcats received a superb individual
performance from senior Brad Becken.

Becken garnered an eighth place finish out
of a field of 130 runners on an 8k course with
a time of 26:21.

More importantly, he displayed great lead-
ership by running hard from the start, as last
meet’s leading runner, senior captain Jimmy
Swansbrough, and top-seven finisher Ben
Gaspar, a junior, were forced to sit out with a
quadriceps injury and bronchitis.

They both hope to return for next weekend.

All eyes were on Becken from the start. He
held the lead until portions of the middle
miles, when a group of High Point runners was
able to surge past him.

“T was trying to hold them off one step at
a time, but, suddenly, they just took off,”
Becken explained. “ButI was happy with how
I raced. I took.a chance and went after it.”

Added coach Andrew, “Brad showed his
guts today. He knew what he wanted and was
aggressive from the gun.”

The rest of the squad finished shortly
after Becken, with junior Chris Schmader
running the course in 26: 40 to earn a 14" place
finish.

Impressive finishes followed from fresh-
men Austin Mercadante and Jonathon Baker,
who touched the finish line in ibis 07 and 27:18,
respectively.

‘Junior Greg Scott, who came down with a
cold the night before, still finished with a solid
time of 27:23. Junior Colby Broadwater and
freshman Joe Taylor rounded out the top seven.

“We didn’t get the pack of runners that we
wanted today,” Andrew said. “But we really
raced. We had some great performances, and
the guys went out and competed. We knew we
had to improve on that. I’m excited heading
into next week’s Great American race.”

Schmader credits the team’s improve-
ment to a change in focus. “The team as a
whole was more mentally focused than last
time,” he said.

“T think we really attacked the race today,
and it showed in the results. It bodes well for
future races.”

_ Heading into its largest meet of the year
this Friday in Charlotte, the Davidson team is
excited about what lies ahead. The team
believes they are ready to gather some mo-
mentum and run past ‘the opposition. Only
time, training, and racing will tell.

Charlie Slagle, ‘Sartorio has been impressed
by Davidson’s soccer program and reputation
for years.
- Sartorio’s chose to attend Davidson. over a
myriad of other schools such as UNC-Chapel
Hill, Princeton, and UNC-Wilmington.
Defending National Champions, UNC-
Chapel Hill, actively recruited Sartorio for its
roster, but did not give him as much as a
prominin future in their program as Davidson.
“T was hoping to be able to come here and
make an immediate impact,” Sartorio said,
'‘whereas at Carolina I would be on the roster,
but who knows if I would have ever been able
to see the field.”
A strong soccer reputation was not the sole
factor in choosing to play here.
“I chose Davidson because of the soccer
coach, Matt Spear, the great guys on the team,
dd Davidson’s academic reputation,” Sartorio
xplained. “Plus my parents were pushing it
ard. ”
Davidson’ s unique ability to compete at the
ivision I level and have such a small student
y makes its athletic program distinctive.
artorio, already thinking about his academic
ture, is considering majoring in Spanish. “I
ant to be a farmer in Bolivia with my brother,”
e joked.
Earning some points early in the season
ith a goal and an assist at the Army/adidas
lassic, Sartorio has proved that he can com-
ete at the Division I level. Coach Spear has

lot friendlier and warmer [than other col-
leges], impacting my decision to play
their team,” the North Carolina East-West
All-Star said. “I came out after having talked
to Coach Spear on my visit thinking ‘Hell
yeah, this could work out’.”

_ Thus far, it certainly has worked out.
The Wildcats, now 3-2-1 on the season, have
benefited from the play of Sartorio and sev-
eral other freshmen, including Matt Allen
and Nahum Navas

“T think we have the best freshman class
in the nation,” Sartorio boasted. “ I couldn’t
imagine going to any other soccer program
where I would be as excited to play with the
team, especially with my freshman team-
mates, as I would at Davidson.”

He also noted the experienced players’
guidance has allowed for such a promising
season. “I feel really close to all the guys on
the team. Older guys like Joe Bass and Bart
Creasman really knew how to make me feel
at home.”

Thé upset of UNC-Chapel Hill was the
highlight of the season so far, briefly elevat-
ing Davidson to 17" in the nation. “We got
two big wins over Charleston and Carolina,”
Sartorio commented. “We are the type of
team with players like David Peoples and
Soren Johnson in the backfield that we can
get big upsets like that.”

“T’m glad I’ m out there playing in front of
Nahum [on the field], because his mom is
always out there screaming for me. I like the
