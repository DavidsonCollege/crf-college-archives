Fewer Students Visiting
High Schools This Year

By BOB DUNHAM
News Edior

The Admissions Office is
continuing to use student rep-
resentatives for high school
college day programs, but to
a lesser degree.

According to Jon Regen.
assistant director of ad-
missions, there are two rea-
sons for the decrease in stu-
dent involvement in the pro-
grams.

The primary reason, he
said, is that most students
have not shown sufficient in-
terest and have been unwill-
ing to spend the time in prep-
aration.

“Earlier this year we had
two orientation meetings for
those interested in partici-
pating."" Regen added. “‘At
the first we had just 11 stu-
dents: only eight showed up
for the second.”

Length
Of Camp
Unchanged

Rumors that the 6-week
summer training camp for
advanced ROTC students was
about to be extended to eight
weeks were denied Wednes
day by Col. Frederick B. Out-
Jaw, professor of military
science.

Outlaw said that tentative
plans call for the training
program at Ft. Bragg to be
gin around June 15 and to
end about Aug. 1.

He said the rumors ‘might
have resulted from discussion
of a plan to stagger the 6-
week periods. with half of
the cadets arriving at two
weeks later than the other
balf.

Although the camp would
be ran for eight weeks, Out-
law said, students wonld re-
ceive only six weeks of train-
ing.

Outlaw emphasized, how-
ever, that the plan is only
under discussion, and has not
yet been adopted.

The reason for the plan
was the overcrowding of fa-
cilities at the camp which
are used mainly during the
first two weeks of summer
training. More than 3,000

cadets are expected at camp
this year.

“We just can’t send a stu.
dent who is totally unpre-
pared,”’ he said. ‘Those who
came to the programs and
those who worked in the pro-
gram last year have been
used, but they are the only
ones who have shown suffi-
cient interest."

This year the Admissions
Oftice staff has been increas-
ed by the appointment of one
of last year's graduating
seniors, John Gresham, as an
assistant. This, according to
Regen, is the second reason
for the decrease in student
participation.

“We have used students
most of the time.’ Regen
said. “‘but. if Gresham is
available. he goes.”

The program was initiated
last year by the Admissions
Office and the Student Coun-
cil, The program was head
ed last year by Tom Earn
hardt.

When Earnhardt was elect-
ed. president of the’ Stucent
Council, he appointed’ Ken.
Tarleton. now: a senior. to act
as the liaison officer heading
up the college day programs.

Due to a misunderstanding
about responsibilities of a
liaison officer, Tarelton re-
signed his post early this
year, Regen said. Since that

time. there has been no stu-
dent in charge of the pro-
gram.

“The job involves making
sure that there is a repre
sentative at each program.”
said Regen. “This means
that unless the liaison officer
can get someone to go to each
one. he must go himself. It
is a big responsibility.”

Regen added that once the
school committed itself to
sending representatives to
college day programs, it
must send a representative.
Two times this year, repre-
sentatives failed to show up,
he said.

“We need to be represent-
ed.’ he added, ‘‘but we also
need to send a qualified per-
son. one who is interested in
taking a positive attitude in
representing Davidson."

“I was pleased with the
program: last year."” he said.
“and the students who have
worked this year have done
a fine job. But next year we
are goirig to have to get start
ed sooner.”*

Regen. added. “I hope and
expect that the Student Coun-
cil will appoint a student who
can work with the program
before the end of the school
year so that we can make our
best effort in the program.”

THAT GREASY KID STUFF

Lawrence Kearns, Union custodian, washes oil
off the College Union terrace. The terrace
was oiled over the Thanksgiving holidays, for
some unknown reason. One Union Board mem-

ber theorized that some focal
spread the olly substance on the terrace to
slide across it on bicycles. It provided a slick

Five Refrigerators Found
During Holiday Search

A recent search of dormi-
tory rooms revealed five il-
legal refrigerators. accord-
ing to Mrs. .Peter Nichoils,
director of student housing.

The search was prompted
by the repeated blowing of
fuses-in Watts Dormitory due
to overloading electrical cir-
cuits, Mrs. Nicholls said.

Emphasizing that the
search did not involve looking
inside closets or under beds,
Mrs. Nicholls said that those
students who were fuund to
have refrigerators ‘‘would
only be required to remove
them.”

The rule forbidding refrig-
eratots was originally insert-
ed in the dormitory regula-

tions because of the overload- .

ing of electrical circuits that
would result, she said.

“Refrigerators are usually
discovered during Christmas
vacation.”” she continued.
“when the power is turned
off and the milk or cheese
which some students leave
begins to spoil."

The search, by members of
dormitory staffs, took place
during the holidays and on
Monday and turned up the
five illegal refrigerators.

Commenting on damage
within the dormitories since
classes began in September.
Mrs. Nicholls said that dam-
age was no worse than last
year at the same time. She
added that there is still the
problem of no judicial action
being’ taken by the student
government against those re-
sponsible for damage.

The Student Council took
steps to remedy the situation
by censuring .the Investigat-
ing Committee two weeks
ago. The chairman of the
committee, Buddy Newsom,
rebutted the charges at the
Student Council meeting
Tuesday.

The Investigating Commit-
tee is charged with investi-
gating all reports of viola-
tions of ‘the Student Body
Regulations or the Honor
System and presenting the
evidence to the proper court.

The problem had apparent-
ly been in lack of communi-
cations between the commit-
tee and the two courts, ac-
cording to a member of the
Student Council.

Mrs. Nicholls refrained
from criticism of the student
juliciary, but expressed a
strong desire that something

age.

3 From Faculty
On Committee

The Student Council Com.
mittee on Student Regula-
tions will be the first student
committee to have voting
members from the faculty.

According to committee
chairman Mike Carroll, facul-
ty representation makes the
Student Regulations Commit-
tee “unique” and is a recip-
rocal response to increases in
student representation on
faculty committees.

Dr. Alexander J. McKel-
way, assistant professor of
Bible and religion, has been
chosen as the voting member
from the faculty. Other mem-
bers are Will H. Terry. pastor
of the Davidson College Pres-
byterian Church and Thomas
O. Pinkerton, associate pro-
fessor of German.

Carroll indicated that the
committee is presently oper-
ating under the belief that
with the implementation of
the Blue Sky program. stu-
dents should have more re-
sponsibility for their social
atmosphere just as they will
have more responsibility for
their own education.

“We hope to make con-
crete suggestions for a more
realistic system.’ Carroll
stated. He expressed his
hope that a new system would
be a united body of student-
faculty regulations which
would replace the two separ-
ate systems now in use.

In reviewing the current
system of regulations and
punishments, its history, ef-
fects and justifications, the
committee will employ a stu-
dent opinion poll and views of
students not on the commit-
tee to aid them in reaching
a decision.

Handbook
Deadline
To Be Set

Tom Baker, newly elected
editor of the ‘Wildcat Hand-
book,”’ said Wednesday that
he plans to prevent any de-
lay in publication by includ-
ing copy and _ publication
deadlines in his printer's con-
tract.

Baker said that the con-
tract he makes with who-
ever prints the handbook will
include a provision that. the
copy must be submitted to
the printer by mid-June and
that the handbook must be
ready for distribution by
mid August.

The “Wildcat Handbook’’
was not ready this year un-
til after school had started.
Baker said he plans to re-
turn next year to the policy
of distributing it to the fresh-
men before they arrive at
school.

Vending Machine Action

By JOHN WILLIAM
Staft Writer

“When I speak, people act.” Junior
Joe Murphy said it, explaining the recent
acquisition of several new vending ma-
chines for the dormitories.

Murphy, on behalf of the Student
Council, has been seeking “bigger and
better vending machines,” and evidently
he has found some. Two cold-drink ma-
chines were installed Tuesday — one
each in Little and Duke dormitories.

Murphy made his way through admin-
istrative red tape that led him to see Mrs.
Peter Nicholls, director of student hous-
ing; Robert A. Currie, college business
manager; Currie’s secretary, Mrs. Robert
Bordeaux; and Gover Meetze, director of
the physical plant.

He said the problem was not to con-

We've got pizza, delicatessen sandwiches, hambur-

gers, cheese cake, and cider. Can't argue with c), but before you check

a) or b)—pencils up! There have been some
changes. Drastic changes in the business
scene. But changes in the vox populi attitude
tegarding business . .. especially on campus
... just haven't kept pace.

Take the belabored point that business
turns you into a jellyfish. The men who run
most of the nation’s successful firms didn’t
arrive by nepotism, by trusting an Ouija
board, or by agreeing with their bosses. Along
the way, a well-modulated “No” was said.
And backed up with the savvy and guts to-
day's business demands.

In short, individuality is highly prized in
much of the business world—the successful
much. Even when the business is big. Like
Western Electric, the manufacturing and sup-
ply unit of the Bell System.

_ We provide communications equipment for

vince the administration of the need for
the vending machines but to find the
right person to order the machines.

He said other machines have been
ordered but have not yet arrived. These
include a cigarette machine and a food
machine in Belk, a candy machine in
East, a cigarette machine in Duke, a
candv machine in Little and a cigarette
machine and a drink machine similar to
that in the gymnasium in Richardson.

Murphy said he was especially pleased
with the project “because it proves to the

went vouy that the Student Council
performs some tangible functions.” He
said he feels that too many students be-
lieve the Student Council does not do
anything directly for the students.

Murphy said his next project would
be “teiephones on every hall.”
