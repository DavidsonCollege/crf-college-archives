Karkpatrick speaks on recent visit to Soviet Union

By JIM DILLON

Jeane Kirkpatrick, former am-
bassador to the United Nations,
spoke last Friday to a standing
room only crowd in the Chambers
Gallery on her recent visit to the
Soviet Union during which she
and several other former govern-
ment officials met with Mikhail
Gorbachev.

Kirkpatrick’s speech focused
primarily on human rights viola-
tions in the Soviet Union and ex-
pressed hope that, under the
leadership of Gorbachev, the
quality of life in that nation will
improve. Kirkpatrick emphasized
Gorbachev’s “great energy, vital-
ity and charm” and distinguished
him from former Soviet heads of
State.

“Mikhail Gorbachev is very
different from his predecessors.
The first and most striking differ-
ence is just that he is thuroughly
alive,”
recent heads of state in the Soviet
Union who came into office at an
' old age and who died soon after
taking command. ;

Kirkpatrick stressed a com-
parison between Gorbachev and

former Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev.. Khrushchev, she
said, was a “genuine reformer” in
the area of human rights.

“He took dramatic steps to re-
lieve repression. He threw open
the gates of the Gulag and
thousands of prisoners streamed
out. He printed [Alexander] Sol-
zhenistyn and [Boris] Pasternak,
and he undertook a borad cam-

his downfall, saying that follow-
ing his efforts aimed at reform
with the Communist Party, he was
“quite unceremoniously
dumped.”
Kirkpatrick emphasized
though that Gorbachev is also like
Khruschev in that while internal
reform is promising, attitudes to-
ward foreign policy are not. She

“mean a less opressive foreign
policy.” Kirkpatrick said Soviet
foreign policy toward the United
States has changed little during

Gorbachev’s administration. She .

also said it is “clear that he is not a
great friend of ours: He does not

thing; nor that we know the ici
tions.”

says Gorbachev supports, of on
site inspections and reductions in
the number of intérmediate and
short range nuclear missles. She
emphasized that with the allow-
ance of inspections the Soviet
“desire for reduction may not only
be real but verifiable by real stan-
dards.”

Questions following Kirkpat-

rick’s speech centered around
U.S. - foreign policy toward
Nicaragua. Kirkpatrick agrees
with the Reagan administration's
support for the contra rebels in
their attempt to overthrow the
Sandinista regime in that country.
She said the U/S. government

supports those Nicaraguans “who

are fighting, I think, for their inde-
pendence.”

Kirkpatrick emphasized that
the U.S. financially supported the
Sandinista regime following the
overthrow of the Somoza govern-
ment. She said that the Sandinis-
tas promised free speech and reli-
gion and open elections when they
came to power but that “they did
not keep their promises.” She said
that the Sandinistas “came to
power by force and govern by
force” and that “it is appropriate
for the U.S. to support resistance
to that government.”

Emphasizing Soviet
weaponry in Nicaragua currently,
Kirkpatrick said that the Castro
government in Cuba is an impor-
tant force behind U.S. security in
Central America. Kirkpatrick said
prior to “what happened in Cuba”
that “nobody had ever though of it
(Central America) as a region of
strategic importance.”

Kirkpatrick further
phasized differences between
U.S. interests in Nicaragua and
those in the earlier Vietnam con-
flict. Kirkpatrick said the most

important difference is that no
“American ‘solideérs' aré fighting in
Nicaragua with the exception of
volunteers.

Shevchenko addresses Gorbachev and US/Soviet relations

By NELLE McCORKLE —
official ever to defect, Arkady
Shevchenko addressed the
“United States and the Soviet
Union under Gorbachev” hefore a
packed Chamber’s Gallery audi-
ence Wednsday night.

A five-year Under Secretary
General of the United Nations
until 1978, Shevchenko also
served as a top advisor to former
Soviet FOreighn Minister Andrei
Gromyko. __

“The Soviet Union is now in
new stage of its development.
Gorbachev cannot be compared
with the old invalids who ruled the
Soviet Union,” Shevchenko said.
Gorbachev indicates three major
goals for his country: glasnost,
economic restructuring, and
economic acceleration, according
to Shevchenko.

Glasnot, often translated as
“openness,” permits limited de-
bate within the Soviet media,
Shevchenko said. The govern-
ment continues to control all
‘newspapers and television and
radio stations, but glasnot repre-
sents an advance: “It’s definitely a
positive development in the
- Soviet Union,” Shevchenko said.

Gorbachev has instituted var-
ied reforms, but his permitting
free travel or free voting seems
unlikely, © Shevchenko © said.

“What Gorbachev is doing cannot
be called even a beginning.”
Reforms prompt comparisons

of Gorbachev to Peter the Great,

but Shevchenko called the anal-
ogy inappropriate. He noted Peter
the Great’s attempts to Westernize

the nation, as opposed to Gor-

bachev’s efforts at internal Soviet-
style development. :

Soviet foreign policy will re-
main substantially unchanged
under Gorbachev, Shevchenko
believes. Shevchenko instead em-
phasized Gorbachev’s internal
concerns: “His interests are essen-
tially domestic.”

Continued weapons build-up
appears inevitable, Shevchenko
said. “It’s too late now to talk
about the elimination of nuclear

weapons. I think it would be:

ideal . . . but unfortunately this
is the fantasy, and we have to be
realistic.” He added that current
Soviet military expenses exceed
U.S. costs by three times.
Shevchenko _ characterized
Gorbachev as cautious and realis-
tic. “Gorbachev is a true com-
munist. He is loyal to the Soviet
system . . . He believes in the
potential of the Soviet system.”
Additionally, Gorbachev's sup-
porters include the KGB and
much of the general population.

“In ‘a certain way, KGB are his al-

lies,” Shevchenko remarked.

Regardless of these barriers,

_ Shevchenko indicated hope for

heightened U.S/Soviet communi-
cation. “Recently . . . there is a

prospect ...of possible arms
control and a probability of a visit

~~ by Mr. Gorbachev,” he said.

Soviet defector Arkady Shevchenko

Despite broad popularity,
Gorbachev does not govern alone,
Shevchenko said. The Politburo,
of which Gorbachev is one of 11
members, leads collectively al-

though he posses greater appoint-

‘ment privileges. Shevchenko also

noted that the U.S. Constitution
grants greater Presidential powers
than the Soviet Union permits its
Secretary-General.

* "The Politburo elects its own
members without party accounta-
bility, but Gorbachev demonstra-
tes consistent communist views
Shevchenko said. “Gorbachev's
emergence was no accident, His

__ selection was, in my view, histori-

cally ie: ee

Gorbachev did not possess a
coherent program upon his 1985
election as Secretary-General,
Shevchenko said. “Gorbachev
came to office without a clear-cut
blueprint.” He added that this ini-
tial lack of definite direction con-
tributed to increased U.S. confu-
sion regarding Soviet policy.

Shevchenko felt that Ameri-
can/Soviet realtions will never be
untroubled. He attributed
negotiating difficulties to conflict-
ing media ‘reports, Soviet internal
disorder, and —_— incomplete
analysisby American Soviet ex-
perts.

A unified Western position
appears impossible, Shevchenko
said. “We cannot do much to in-
fluence what’s going on in the
Soviet Union.”

“Instead Shevchenko called for
joint Democratic and Republican
support of negotiations. “In gen-
eral, in dealing with the Soviet
Union, we need much more more
bipartisan support in this coun-
try,” he said.

He also stressed that Aier
cans must separate Soviet govern-
ment from Soviet citizens. “I
think we must make .. . a dis-
tinction between a regime which

one might not like and the Soviet
Union as a . . . great nation,” he
said.

Born in the Ukraine, Shev-
chenko became a diplomat in
1956 following graduation from
Moscow State Institute of Interna-
tional Relations. He is married to
a Wilmington, N.C. native.

Shevchenko’s lecture, spon-

_ sored by the Dean Rusk Program

in International Studies, also re-
ceived a grant from American

‘Telephone and Telegraph.
