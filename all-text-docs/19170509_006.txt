M1SS MAY HENDERSON
MARRIES MR. BOWEN

Quite unexpectedly to their friends,
and causing a pleasant surprise, was the
marriage at high noon, Tuesday, May
1st, of Miss Mary Henderson, the sec-
ond daughter of Mrs. M. A. Hender-
son, to Mr. W. Banks Bowen, now of
Richmond, Va., but recently of Durham,
N.C. The ceremony was performed by
Dr. C. M. Richards, at the home of the
bride’s mother, in the presence of the
immediate family and a_ few close
friends. ‘The bridal couple left immedi-
ately for Richmond. ‘The bride, who
has been teaching for the past session at
Mebane, N. C., had just returned to
Davidson and introduced her fiance to
her family and sisters living here. A
sudden change in their plans, agreeable
to all concerned, resulted in the mar-
raige taking place ‘Tuesday instead of at
a later date, as had heen expected.

The groom is a very successful and
prosperous business man, while his bride
is a young woman of popular gifts and
graces that make her welcome every-
where.

ALUMNI BANQUFT.

Plans are now under way for the
Alumni Banavet to be held in the Y. M.
C. A. building during Commencement.
The Alumni Banavet last year was such
a great success that it has proved the
need of such an occasion for the Alumni
to get together and show the “Old Dav-
idson Spirit” which they have kept since
leaving college. This will be one of the
most interesting events of Commence-
ment, and tho the cost of provisions is
high at this time. the price will only be
75 cents ner plate. Order yours as soon
as possible so as to get a seat.

DEFICIT IN PARKER FUND .

HAS BEEN MADE UP

Last Friday evening directly
supper, at a student body meeting, Dr.
H. B. Arbuckle made a stirring appeal
with reference to the Parker Fund, a
sum raised each year by the student
body to support W. P. Parker, ‘11,
M.A. ’12, missionary to Korea. The
generous response of the fellows. clearly
showed that the matter had only to be
placed squarely before them and the
amount lacking would be raised. With
what cai and pledges given at the
meeting and further payments, the short-
we was made up.

BOOKS ARF PRESENTED
TO SENIOR BIBLE CLASS

Dr. J. B. Shearer has presented each
of the members of the Senior Bible class

after

with a copy of the book “Prayer Meet-
ing Papers.” It was written by Mrs.
Lizzie Gessner Shearer, and edited by
her husband after her death. The book
contains a sketch of her life and is en-
hanced by several illustrations. It is a
memorial volume and has proved very
acceptable to all.

LARGE ENROLLMENT FOR
NEXT YEAR INDICATED

Altho it is too eariy to get definite in-
formation, the prospects seem to indicate
that Davidson will open next fall with
as large a registration as this year. The
number of applications and inquiries re-
ceived thus far is as large as usual, and
point to a large Freshman class. With
every student as a “canvasser” and rep-
resentative of Davidson, can there be any
uncertainty as to the size of the student
body next year?

ing.”
