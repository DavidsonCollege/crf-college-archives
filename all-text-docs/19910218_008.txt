Vote for Candidates,
Not Their Colored Paper

Six days: the amount of time that passes between the end of
election sign-ups and the beginning of elections. That means our
candidates have only six days to don their ubiquitous flyers, and
six days for the campus to see who can actually scotch-tape the
most colored paper to the walls and stalls of our institution. No
one seems to mind the superficial, platformless process of name-
recognition. .

For this reason, it was not unexpected when a Davidsonian
attempt to endorse the most qualified candidates--after listening
to the platforms of each and every person running for president
and vice-president--met with a rejection by the editorial board in
a 15-4 vote. It was as expected as the whining around campus that

rang throughout when the decision to endorse was announced in

the first place.

- And now the forum for the candidates to vocalize their views
has been cancelled, which is no surprise. Very few students
attended last year according to one member of last year’s SGA.
The forums seem inherently superfluous on this lackadaisical
campus.

Why not run the SGA presidency and vice-presidency as
Honor Council elections are run: allow no campaigning? Or at
least allow more time for true campaigning? Why doesn’t the
present SGA organize amandatory forum in which the candidates
are videoed during a question-and-answer period, after which the
video is featured in the Union pit for a week?

Why not do something besides count the votes after the
election is over? .

This week’s paper is replete with candidate information. There
are transcripts reprinted from the Davidsonian meeting held on
February 13 with the seven students running in the election. Itis
mere fancy to assume or hope that people will read them, but they
are there. The transcripts are near-verbatim, edited by the candi-
dates themselves.

There are flyers, but they are colored paper and large print.
Why not read the small print in black and white?

Isernia Finds Column Offensive

To the Editor:

Like most Davidson stu-
dents, I have read D.A. Th-
ompson’s articles in the
Davidsonianand never gave
them a second thought. I
just passed them off as opin-
ionated “journalism.” Noth-
ing more, nothing less.
However, two weeks ago,
Mr. Thompson attacked the
Davidson fight song, school
spirit, and athletic teams.
Instead he supported drunk-
enness, student apathy to-
ward athletics, and NCAA
tules violations. After the
column, Ican no longer hold
my tongue. It’s time] set the
record straight.

Five years ago, the
Davidson Football team was
in disarray. First year coach
Vic Gatto had inherited a
squad of only thirty players,
(including five seniors). He
and his staff worked hard to
recruit thirty freshmen that
year and another thirty the
next. Davidson was begin-
ning to revive their ailing
football program. - Then,
trustees and former athletic
director Kit Morris decided
to withdraw from. the divi-
sion 1AA Colonial League
and opt for independent
status. With this announce-

ment, thirty-five players
transferred schools. All that
took so long to build was de-
stroyed in one fell swoop.
The football team was again
forced to play inexperienced
underclassmen against sen-
iors.

Last year’s decision to
drop the football team to
Division III was, inmy eyes,
a cop-out on the part of the
trustees. They were unwill-
ing. to leave the team in
Division IAA and give us a
chance to mature and win.

Going into this past
football season, I was both
apprehensive and excited;
apprehensive about playing
Division III football under a
new head coach and excited

about playing Division III.

football under a new head
coach. Looking back on my
experiences, I would not
have changed a thing. Dave
Fagg, his staff and his
“family” attitude rekindled
an old fire and winning feel-
ing in Davidson football.
The beloved fight song was
played every day at practice

and on Saturdays after wins.

The fight song isa proud and
permanent part if my life that
I will cherish forever. By
the way, do. you know the

fight song? Ask any. foot-

ball player, and they will help
youout with the words, That
is if you aren’t too busy
“shooting the healthy”,
smoking yourcigarettes, and
drinking your beer.

Getting back to the ar-
ticle, I will address your at-
tack on the basketball team.
(I feel I can speak in their
defense because I have been
ina similar situation, Iknow
some of the players, I have
seen them practice, and I
have seen them in games.)
Are you suggesting chang-
ing leagues? Changing divi-
sions? I hope none of the
trustees read your article,
and, those who did, did noth-
ing more than line their bird
cages with your column. To
those of you who support
Mr. Thompsonand doubt the
team, listen to me and give
them achance. These guys
are underclassmen playing
their hearts out against sen-
iors. Look at the talent for
the upcoming years- Hol-
loway, Marsh, Zimmerman,
Chapin, Heuer, Denmond,
Musch, Drobnitch, Freeman,
etc. Don’t panic! Give
Coach Mcillop, his staff and
players time to get experi-
enced and win. Because they

Savona Missed Point of Article

Dear Mr. Savona:

Although we are spend-
ing a semester abroad in
Italy, we tooreceive and read
The. Davidsonian. Unlike
you, however, we do not feel
continuously subjected to

_ Sara Carlson “bitching” (to

use your terminology). Liv-
ing in-a different environ-
ment re-emphasizes to us

that destructive female and.

male relationships prevail
everywhere. And thus, it was
very disappointing to read
your article.

You were struck by
specifics in the article and
became offended by a sup-
posed attack on Davidson
men. Sara does no use her
article to attack the male
race--that is viewing the
women’s issues she writes
about on a shallow level. If
you had read the article care-
fully you would have read
Sara addressing women as
well as men. For instance,
she advises women, “If we
continue to allow ourselves
tobe objectified by men, and
continueto accept like judg-
ments of other women, we
perpetuate the role of women
as property of men, to be
_Manipulated and controlled
as he chooses.”

Sara does not use the
Davidson men as a “‘battle-
field” when she writesabout

such women’ $ concems as
| these, along with sexual

harassment and rape. We do
not feel that as a freshman
yourealize women face these
situations at Davidson. If you
did realize that these situ-
ations occur at Davidson,
then we do not think you
would feel Sara flippantly
writes about these issues.

Furthermore, an edu-
cated student should be able
to express oneself without
resorting to curse words and
slang expressions (i.e. “Get
a grip.”) You are correct;
however,
observation that Sara’s ar-
ticle pertained to sexual dis-
crimination. But you vo-
cabulary is reminiscent of
one who does not think be-
fore writing. You write to
Sara that “the subjugation of
women is not the result of
every social conflict. that
occurs on Davidson’s cam-
pus whether [she] wants to
believe it or not.”

The subjugation of

women to what? Youcannot |

just write “the subjugation
of women”--they must be
subjected to something.
Before your start to criticize
a woman writing about

women’s issues, you should

not only be articulate but

educated on them. Do not
write that Sara is “bitching”

because she is addressing

issues that many women at
Davidson are concerned

about. In order to educate

yourself, attend a Womén’s

missed it entire’ ‘andi chose:

Concerns meeting or talk to
the Committee’s Chairper-
son, Sandra Smith.

When we read Sara’s
article, we perceived that it
addressed various women’s
concerns through a familiar
lens--the Davidson/Queenie
controversy. Granted you
my havea problem with this
approach, but yowhinderthe

potential good of Sara’s ar-.

ticle with your reply.
Women’s issues are still in
an'amorphous stage. There-
fore, they need discussing
and probing as’ much as
possible--which is what she
is ‘doing. Men and women
together, as well as with their
respective sex, need to make
a more concerted effort at
communication and respect.
Sara states that detrimental
situationscan be avoided “‘so
easily by using common
sense and ‘treating every

individual as a thinking,’

sentient being.”
If you ‘are concerned
about rape and sexual dis-

crimination, this part of the

article mi
