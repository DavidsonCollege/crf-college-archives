Anonymous flyers

By TREEBY WILLIMASON

Early Tuesday morning, signs
urging freshmen males to “not be
misled” by joining Kappa Sigma
were hung in Belk dormitory. In
addition, flyers were placed under
each freshman room in Belk.

The poster, put up anonym-
ously, asks “How much do you re-
ally know about Kappa Sigma?”
and warns “Do not pass up a sure
thing for a misguided hopeless
idea. Play it safe and self-select
this week, take advantage of your

options.”

At Tuesday’s SGA meeting,
Freshman Class President Bill
Sutton brought up the issue as a
freshman concern. He said the
freshman class disapproved of the
fact that the posters were put up
and distributed.

SGA Vice-President Christie
Johnson said many houses and in-
dividuals have been accused, but
presently, these accusations are
unfounded. The SGA, according

to Johnson, “does not feel it’s our
place to reprimand; however, we
do act as a forum to air student
complaints. We would like the
person responsible to come for-
ward immediately.”

Sutton echoed Johnson’s
statements in stressing that he will
continue to pursue this issue in
order to determine the responsible
party or parties. He also plans to
heed the advice given by the SGA
to speak to Dean Terry and the

Patterson Court Council about the
incident. Sutton said he feels such
an act is “an attack on freshmen”
and said it may negatively affect
the self-selection process because
accused houses may lose people
who believe the rumors are true,
undermining the entire self-selec-
tion process.

co-chairman Andrew Henderson
defended the organization. “By no
means or method does anyone in

Armed robber threatens residents

By DAVID WILLIAMS

A man with a loaded gun rob-
bed a Davidson professor and a
bank custodian at the post office
last week, according to Davidson
Police Detective J.F. Ferrell.

On Sunday Jan. 25 at 7:30
p-m. Spanish Professor Lois
Kemp parked her car in front of
the Davidson post Office. “While
inside the post office, she noticed
a black male standing near the
table,” Ferrell said. Kemp re-
turned to her car and proceeded to
get in when the man showed her
the gun and demanded her money.

“I gave him no indication that
I would resist,” Kemp said. She
unlocked her car, removed her
purse, and gave it to the gunman.
The man looked through her purse
and was unable to locate her

Women’s

By DAVID WILLIAMS

A panel discussion Monday
on “Women in Poverty and De-
velopment” and a one-woman
play Tuesday night entitled Sister,
Sister highlighted a number of
programs sponsored for Women’s
Week by the Women’s Concerns
Committee. On Monday, Profes-
sors Janet Grigsby and Leslie Hill-
Davidson discussed the problems
of women in poverty in the United
States and in the intemational.
community. Grigsby talked about
the plight of poverty-stricken
women in the United States. She
said, “Female headed households
have a higher chance of being
poor.” Grigsby said that this fac-
tor has two causes — “the increase
in the divorce rate and the increase

money. Kemp showed the man
the location of approximately $70
in her purse. Kemp said later that
she asked the gunman if she could
have back her purse, as it con-
tained her credit cards and iden-
tification.

The man took the money,
gave Kemp back her purse, and
fled north down Jackson Street.

Kemp went immediately to the
Davidson police department and

. filed a°report. “A search of a ten-

block area revealed nothing at that
time,” Ferrell said.

On Thursday, Jan. 30 at 6:45
p.m. Davidson resident Margaret
Wylie, 25, on Saturday, Feb. 1,
while Wylie was in a vehicle.
Wylie was charged with two
counts of armed robbery, and was

taken to the Mecklenburg County
Jail and put under $15,000 bond
by Magistrate Wolf.

“At this time, we also found
11 other outstanding warrants
against Mr. Wylie — ten being
from another county,” Ferrell
said. Wylie could face a sentence
of anywhere from seven to 40
years for armed robbery, under
North Carolina state law.

Conceming her robbery, Pro-
fessor Kemp said: “It was all over
so fast. I thought he had a toy gun,
and this helped me keep my cool.”
Kemp said that the suspect later
testified that he was carrying a
loaded gun. She added: “I am glad
I had enough money to give him.
Thornburg was emptying trash in
the garbage dumpster behind the
post office when a black male with

a gun robbed her of her purse and
$300. Thornburg’s description of
the gunman “fit the same descrip-
tion as the one of the man that rob-
bed Ms. Kemp only days earlier,”
Ferrell said.

“Through further investiga-
tion by the Police Department, a
black male fitting the description
that she gave was picked up for an
investigation and an interview,”
Ferrell said. Ferrell arrested
Davidson resident Roy Antwan
At this point, I realized that
money is nothing more than
pieces of paper.”

Detective Ferrell encouraged
women to take measures to pre-
vent such incidents from occur-
ring. He said, “Our suggestion is

that any time a female goes any-
where at night, she should be
accompanied by someone else —
a male or female.”

Kemp also expressed her con-
cem that the members of the
Davidson Community discuss
what they can do to limit their vul-
nerability. “This can happen any
place. It has happened many
places before,” she said.

Kemp added: “We like to have
access to the post office ut any
time, but it’s easy for someone to
loiter there, waiting for the right
person to assail. It's important
that we know it can happen in
Davidson and to know how we in
the community can make ourse-
Ives less vulnerable.”

Week examines diverse lifestyles

in teenage pregnancy, coupled
with the increase in the number of
teenage mothers who start a
household.”

Grigsby said that upon becom-
ing divorced, “women generally
don’t get half of what they had
when they were married. Yet typi-
cally women get custody of the
children.” Grigsby noted that ex-
husbands typically do not pay the
necessary alimony and child sup-
port. She said: “One recent study
found that half the fathers ordered
to pay child support actually paid.
In our society, paid child support
is considered voluntary. It’s a cul-
tural, situation.”

“The other big issue,” Grigsby
added, “is what the woman is ac-

tually able to pull in the labor
force.” She said: “Women earn
less in their jobs than men do. The
figure used to be 59 percent, and
now it’s 64 percent. The major
reason they do earn less is that
women and men work in different
jobs. Women are much more con-
centrated in a particular set of
jobs. These are relatively low-
paying jobs.”

Hill-Davidson commented on
the problems of women in the de-
veloping world. She said that
while women comprise about fifty
percent of the world’s population,
“women do two-thirds of the
world’s work and provide sixty
percent of the world’s food.”
However, she added, “Women

own less than one percent of the
world’s property.”

On Tuesday night, actress
Vinie Burrows performed solo in
the play Sister, Sister! Burrows, a
Harlem native, portrayed the role
of the woman in a variety of lifes-
tyles and settings. In the invoca-
tion to the play, Burrows chanted:
“There are more than 2 billion
women on this earth. Will they
come together in friendship and in
peace — saying, ‘Sister, take your
sister's hand?’”

Burrows first acted out the
role of a pregnant woman in labor
and giving birth. She then por-
trayed “An Ole Hillbilly.” She
also performed as a daughter re-
belling against her mother and as

the victim of a horrible rape. Bur-
rows concluded her performance
with an appeal for women’s liber-
ation and reenacted a speech given
by South African dissident Win-
nie Mandela.

Melissa Jones, Chairperson of
the Women’s Concerns Commit-
tee, said that she has been plan-
ning Women’s Week since last
summer. The Week's purpose,
she said, is “to promote awareness
of women’s issues on campus.”
She added: “Women's Week is a
new tradition that was started sev-
eral years ago. We try to reach ev-
eryone we can through pictures
and publicity. We are trying to in-
volve as many students as we
