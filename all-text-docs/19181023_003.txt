“Dear : Iam now up where the Trade St. e on S N. C.
fun is... . Things have changed and

I am over here in the mud. The army
has been the very thing for me. I weigh
about eighteen pounds more than 1 did
when I enlisted and am as hard as a
rock. Believe 1 would go out for foot-
ball if I were back at college. I have
been on my job for a day and night at
the time without rest and can get away
with it. We have good food and very
good hours most of the time. We have
four heavy blankets and sleep well when
we get a chance.

“It is rather exciting to hear the shells
whistle thru the air.

“Don't talk about these little French
mademoisselles. I have seen them and I
believe you will like army life all right.

“We use French coinage altogether.
Remember me to all the boys.”
