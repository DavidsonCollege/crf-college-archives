THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 21, 1934

HALVERSTADT

TENNIS CHAMP

Around the Wildcat’s Lair |

BEAT CAROLINA
—__SATURDAY

Again the annual spring tennis tour-
nament ran true to form and for the
third successive time Jimmy Halver-

stadt was the winner. In the finals
last Saturday he was pited against Tee
Thompson and although a little off
form, he didn’t have much trouble in
disposing of Tee in straight sets. The
tournament was marked by very few
upsets. John Lafferty was beaten by
Tee Thompson in the semi-finals, and
Carlyle Lewis, the number one on last
year’s freshman team, lost a close bat-
tle to Barnett in the earlier stages of
the tourney. And there’s a boy that’s
going places; Martin, conceded little
chance at the outset, battled his way
into the semi-finals, only to be downed
by Halverstadt. Great things are ex-
pected of Jimmy this year. Last spring
he. gained the finals of the state inter-
collegiate tourney, losing to Wilmer
Hines in a thrilling battle, and this
year, once he gets started, he’s going
to be mighty hard to stop.

Congratulations to Charlie Fort on
his re-election as captain of the wrest-
ling team. Although this year’s team
met with little success, Charlie was in
there every minute, and went through
the season winning four out of five
matches. His re-election is the wrest-
ling team’s appreciation of the fine
spirit he has maintained throughout
the year. Coach Unger has been hold-
ing spring practice for the grapplers
during the past few weeks, and his
predictions point to a better team for
the 1935 edition.

Did you see Jake Wade's spring
football summary in the Sunday Ob-
server? He seems to think that the
brand of football that Big Five teams
display in the coming fall campaign
will be on an altogether higher level
than that-seen this past season. With
the new coaches, Hunk Anderson at
State and Carl Snavely at the Univer-
sity, improvements will certainly be
shown at these two institutions. Duke
will be about the same while Davidson
and Wake Forest should come forward
quite a bit. But those State boys are
going to be the surprise package next
year. With a vast abundance of beef
and brawn, and a new system installed,
they promise to present a much more
formidable outfit with the 1934 line-up.

The student body will get its first
chance to see the cinder path artists
in action this Saturday when the var-
sity squares off with North Carolina
University. A meet with Wofford was
originally scheduled for the attraction,
but this has been cancelled and the
better U. N. C. team engaged in its
place, Davidson, though sadly Jacking
in several events, should put up a stiff
fight. With a number of new men,
such as Evans, Lee, Frazier, Pittman,
and others up from last year’s fresh-
man squad, the track team should con-
tinue to hold its own against all comers,
The. University. has a well-rounded
outfit in every event, as they have al-
ready shown in winning the Southern
Conference indoor championship. It
will be a real treat to see such men
as Abernathy, Montgomery, LeGore,
and McRea in action. But let us not
be dismayed. The track team needs
the support of the students, so why
not let’s all turn out with our girl
friends Saturday and down those high
and mighty Tar Heels? :

With spring in the air, the golfers
are teeing off in hosts. Professor Ful-
cher, faculty advisor, has been doing
noble work in keeping the ball rolling,
and already a large number of men
have turned in their qualifying scores
for the golf team competition. At the
present, Bowman, Barnes, Hamrick,
Bunn, and Cochran are the best bets
for the four coveted positions.

Michigan, State College comes here
on the 27th to open the baseball sea-
son with Coach Laird’s proteges. In
the first scrimmage last week, the re-
serves gave the famed first team a
terrible drubbing, and Laird seems
none too pleased with the leavings of
last year’s champions, But with a little
more time and practice the boys should
be ready to swing into their state cam-
paign. Charlie Harris, «star right-
hander, already in training from the
basketball season, is rearing to go. The
results of many a battle will depend
on him. Morgan, Mackorell, Bumgar-
ner, and Mock are the other lettermen

Wildcat Trackmen
To Meet Carolina
Here On Saturday

Meet With Wofford Is Cancelled
Due to Easter Vacation

CANDIDATES NAMED

Local Cindermen Will Meet Win-
ners of Indoor Title

Due to a change in schedule, the
University of North Carolina will be
Davidson's first opponent in a dual
track meet which will take place Sat-
urday afternoon on Richardson Field.
Wofford was scheduled for this date,
but found it necessary to cancel the
engagement because it conflicts with
their spring vacation.

Dayidson recently competed in the
Southern Conference Indoor Meet in
which the Wildcats carried off second
place honors among the non-confer-
ence schools. At the same time the
University won the Southern Confer-
ence indoor title.

Captain Pritchett has announced a
tentative line-up of those who are to
participate in the various events.
Evans, Faison and Parker are the best
eandidates for the sprints. Evans won
the 60-yard dash at Chapel Hill and
tied the present record for non-con-
ference competitors, ‘om

Frazier, Grant and Johnson are listed
for the 440-yard dash and Oakes, Cor-
bin and Rose will enter the half-mile
race. Morrow will participate in the
mile, together with Earle Frazier, if
the latter does not enter the two-mile
race. In addition to Frazier, Gullette
and Glass have been named for the
two-mile course.

McPhail and Pratt are likely candi-

dates for the high hurdles. Pratt has
been suffering with a sprained ankle
and there is still some doubt as to
whether or not he will be in condition
by Saturday. There is little available
material for the low hurdles, but Mc-
Phail and Evans will probably be
called on to fill this post.
- John Lee, paired with Gammon, will
do the high jumping and he will also
team up with Paul Pittman in the pole
vault. Entrants in the broad jump are
Armistead and Grant; in the shot-put,
Cochran, McElrath and Potter; in the
discus, Cochran, Dill and Potter; and
in the javelin, Dill and Cochran. Coch-
tan has received quite a bit of recog-
nition this year in the shot-put.

North Carolina brings a champion-
ship team to Davidson with exceed-
ingly strong men in every event, Out-
standing members of their team are:
McRea, Southern Conference record
holder in the mile run; Montgomery,
Southern champion in the quarter-
mile; Abernathy, state champion in
the high hurdles; LeGore, who holds
the Southern Conference record in the
javelin event; Reid, holder of the
Southern Conference indoor record in
the high jump, and Jackson and Mc-
Donald, who are excellent pole vault-
ers.

Wildcats Prepare
For Michigan Tilt

Reserves Defeat Varsity in First
Practice Game

With less than a week to go before
the baseball game with Michigan State
here, Coach “Red” Laird is fast whip-
ping his men into shape for the open-
ing contest.

Saturday’s practice game between
the varsity and the second string
turned out to be a much-feared upset,
with the latter winning by a score of
7 to 0. In spite of Coach Laird’s ef-
forts, the varsity fell miserably short
of suceess in the hitting department.
Only two hits were made by the first
team during the whole game. How-
ever, the second string performed ad-
mirably and had little trouble in chalk-
ing up their runs.

The reserves started their scoring in
the second inning by gaining two runs,
but didn’t garner the major number
their scores until
fourth innings, giving a total of six
runs. Three doubles in the fourth in-
ning put the reserves far ahead of the
first team,

Coble pitched an excellent game for
the second string and kept the varsity
batters well in check, Loftin, Glad-
stone and Johnston also played nicely
for the reserves. Bumgarner and Rave-

The lack of left-handers in the prac-
tice game Saturday seriously handi-
capped both the hitting and pitching
departments. However, Coach Laird
hopes to make up for this and present
a hard-hitting outfit before the season
is over,

“How the squad will line up indi-
vidually will depend upon how the men
hit,” stated Laird. “Some men who
are not on the job will soon find them-
selves on the bench if they don’t get
busy.”

Frosh Cindermen To

Hold Meet Thursday

High Point High School Will Be
Initial Opponents

The freshman track team:has been
working hard in preparation for. its
first meet of the season with High
Point High School, which will be held
here tomorrow.

Although prospects this year are not

quite as bright as they were last sea-
son, the freshmen have proved their
ability by winning second place in the
inter-class track meet held last week.
The sophomores won first place with
56 points, leading the freshmen, who
gained a total of 47.
Dickson, a first-year man, was high
scorer of the meet with 10 points. He
will take part in several events, in-
cluding the 100-yard dash, the high
hurdles, the high jump, and the broad
jump.

Brock and Dyerly are outstanding
men, entering the low hurdles,

Fowler and D. P. Johnson will run
the 220; Gladden the 440; Cox and
Brown the 880, and Higgins and Clark
the mile,

In the field events there are several
outstanding performers. The services
of Peabody in the pole vault, Dick
Johnson in the discus and shot, and S.
Moffett and Harkins in the javelin are
being counted on by Coach Whittle.

Selected This Week

Five Men Will Be Selected Be-
fore Holidays

According to Charlie Hamrick, man-
ager, the golf tournament between the
students and faculty, which is being
held for the purpose of selecting eight
men to try for the varsity team, will
end today or tomorrow.

At the time this article was written
the men to be selected were doubtful,
the running being about even. Those
making a strong bid for the first eight
positions of this first elimination are:
Bowman, who turned in a low total
score of 153 for 36 holes; Hamrick,
Ben Barnes, Bunn, Powell, Cannon,
Cochran, and Hutaff. Others entered
in the tournament and well in the run-
ning are: Vaiden, Otey, Hellinger,
Price, Porter, Moore, Nickey, and J.
Morrow.

Beginning tomorrow and continuing
until the Easter holidays, the eight
men selected today will ring up a 36-
hole score (probably to be extended
over two or three days) at the Carolina
Golf “Club in Charlotte, the results of
these matches to determine the varsity
team of four men and one alternate.
Like the tennis team, the members of
the golf team will always be open to
challenge by means of the “ladder”
system. .That is, any member of the
team may challenge the man next
above himself and anyone may chal-
lenge the alternate, Thus, the team
is subject to constant change, and thd
best players will be assured positions.

Although there are no lettermen on
the squad, the new material has shown
much improvement since the beginning
of the year, and some of the scores
turned in indicate that stiff competi-
tion will be provided the opponents of
the Wildcat linkmen. Professor H. E,
Fulcher, of the physics department, is
coaching the candidates out for the
golf team this year.

Halverstadt Wins
Over T. Thompson
In Tennis Tourney

Halverstadt Defeats Barnett and
Thompson Defeats Lafferty
in Semi-Finals

TWO MAJOR UPSETS

Twenty-two Team Aspirants En-
ter Tournament

Jimmy Halverstadt, seeded number
one, won with little difficulty the finals
of the annual school tennis tournament
Saturday by virtue of a 6-0, 6-2, 6-3
win over W. T. Thompson in the final
round,

Twenty-two team aspirants entered
the tournament and many well-fought
matches were played. Upsets were nu-
merous throughout the play-off,

The second round found only six-
teen of the original twenty-two men
left in the running, with the eight
seeded players holding true to the
dope. A surprising upset was scored
in the second round by Martin Bar-
nett, Mississippi racquet-wielder, who
downed Lewis, fourth seeded player,
in a two-set match, 6-1, 7-5. Barnett’s
improved backhand and point-scoring
forehand proved too much for Lewis.

Six of the eight seeded players en-
tered the third round losing W. E.
Thompson, who was defeated, 4-6, 6-0,
G-3, by T. B. Gold, and Lewis.

There were no upsets in the quarter-
finals and no what might be called
hard matches, as none of the semi-
finalists dropped a set in gaining their
position, ;

Barnett, in a round which the seed-
ed list said he had small chance of
reaching, was defeated by Halverstadt,
6-1, 6-0, to place the number one player
in the finals.

A match distinguished by smashing
overheads and terrific drives was
fought between Lafferty and W. T.
Thompson to gain the final round from
the lower bracket. Playing a brainy
game of tennis, Thompson won the
match, 6-4, 7-5, 6-3. Real tennis was
exhibited in the match and the out-
come was in doubt till the last game
had been won.

Too much could not be said of the
final match. It was a battle between
two hard-hitting, tennis-thinking play-
ers. Halverstadt, using an effective
drop shot and a well-placed drive
which chopped holes in the court lines,
swept Thompson off his feet in the
first set, winning 6-0, ‘ ;

The second set, as the score indi-
cates, was well fought, but the much
greater experience and perfected shots
of the prospective state champion
Proved too much for the lower bracket
finalist as he dropped the second set,
6-3. Thompson won the first two
games, this being the only time he led
in game score throughout the match.
