A Lack Of Communication

Few people will deny that the pres-
ent phone facilities available to use
by the student body leave something
to be desired. It is not unusual during
the evenings to have three or four
students waiting outside a dorm
phone booth, or sitting around a fra-
ternitv phone, at all hours.

Such a situation is, granted. not
one that will radically affect David-
son’s academic stature, nor one that
will affect our athletic program. But
the shortage of available telephones
during rush hours does create incon-
venience and in a few cases, a hard-
ship, for the students wishing to use
a phone. Our location. plus the fact
that we have an all-male student body,
does make for a potentially jammed-
up situation on out-of-town. calls.

To alleviate the phone shortage we
suggest dorm room phones. It has
been suggested that in view of the
present needs of the college that this
request would involve investment of
college money that could better be

spent elsewhere. We are inclined to
agree with this point. This is why we
emphasize that this program could be
entirely self-supporting, with the ad-
ministration contributing no more
than is done now.

The article located elsewhere on
the page explains how this idea of a
phone-in-every-room would work and
be financed. A rental per month per
phone of from $4 to $8 does not seem
exhorbitant, particularly when one
considers that this cost would be split
probably between the two students
in the room. Small dial locks could
protect the student from unauthoriz-
ed calls.

We do not mean to suggest that in-
stalling the new system might not
bring up additional problems—stud-
ent switchboard operators were even
suggested. But it does seem that the
benefits involved make worthwhile
the risk. That is. room phones in place
of long lines in front of phone booths.

A Change Of Attitude

No body acting on behalf of USNSA shall participate in ‘sectarian religious activities or parti-
san political activities; they shall not take part in activity which does not affect students in their

role as students.

We were delighted to learn that
Davidson’s delegates to the recent
NSA regional conference successfully
initiated action which attempts to
shatter the “politically oriented”
image of the controversial national
Student group.

Davidson, represented by Student
Body President Will Jackson and
Senior Class President Fred Sackett,
strongly urged the Carolinas-Virginia
Regional NSA Conference to adopt
“A Resolution Interpreting the Clause
in the USNSA Constitution Regarding
Legislation Affecting Students in
Their Role as Students.”

Prompted by a recent ultimatum
from the Columbia University Stud-
ent Council to NSA to either pass
this resolution or lose Columbia’s poli-
tical participation, the regional group
defined its political realm as those
activities “that have a direct causal
relationship to matters of concern to
students and their educational or so-
cial milieu, by their virtue of being
students.”

‘With an ear to the student pulse
(Davidson had a noisy hassle last fall;
Wake Forest is currently in the midst
of an NSA dispute), one leading pro-
ponent of the legislation wisely de-
clared at the gathering, “The time
has come for regions to inform thé
national organization that we are not
satisfied with their past performance.
Colleges are leaving NSA because of
the broad interpretation of the ‘stud-
ents as students’ clause. It is time
that the Carolinas-Virginia Region ini-
tiate the steps that should in all prob-
ability define what and why this
clause be re-interpreted.

—Articte X (A), USNSA Constitution

“Division has not and never will
serve any practical purpose. USNSA
is just not in a position to represent
students as citizens, and as long as
this is true, political opinions have no
basis for endorsement by locals or
National NSA.”

As a result of the conference’s ac-
tion, official Carolinas-Virginia Re-
gional NSA policy now:

@urges all schools to mandate
their delegates to refrain from the
introduction of any resolution which
do not affect students in a_ direct
causal relationship in their role as
students,

@urges that delegates abstain at
the National Congress at Minnesota
University this summer whenever
such controversial legislation is offer-
ed on the floor, and

@ urges that delegates support leg-
islation applying the Carolinas-Vir-
ginia interpretation to all National
USNSA policy statements.

¢ *

The fate of NSA at Davidson is
again in guestion. In accordance with
the directive of the voters in last
year’s referendum, Davidson students
will again be, able to vote on NSA on
May 11.

If the move by the Carolinas-Vir.
ginia regional at the National Stud-
ent Congress this summer is success-
ful, we are confidant that NSA will at
last come into its own. Our support
of NSA is based on the liklihood of
this event.

We urge the student body in the
May 11 referendum to support the
continuation of Davidson’s member-
ship in NSA.

The Restraint Of Reality

Hisses from an otherwise courte-
ous audience arose Monday when
James Jackson Kilpatrick completed
his dissection of the Civil Rights bill
with the observation that “time is the
only solution” to the racial problem.
_ That the hisses were discourteous
is obvious. That they reveal a basic
misunderstanding on the -part of the
student body is not so clear.

Conservative newspaper editor Kil-
patrick was not advocating prolong-
ing America’s racial problem. Rather
his contention was that the difficul-
ties of the Negro race could not be
eliminated overnight. He expressed
no pleasure in this fact; neither does
the Davidson student. But here part
the typical student and Kilpatrick.

With cries of “Freedom now!” pelt-
ing him daily via the press and tele-
vision, the student seems inclined to
overlook reality in his emotional pur-
suit of the ideal. On the other hand,
Kilpatrick, although expressing sym-

athy for the goals of the Civil Rights

ill, nevertheless realized that these
goals would not be reached through
legislative shortcuts.

The editor denounced the Civil
Rights bili as unconstitutional, saying

that the only way to attempt legiti-
mately to legislate civil rights is by
constitutional amendment. But he
futher stated that he would oppose
most such amendments. His opposi-
tion again rested on his belief that
the racial strife could not be legislat-
ed away. Attempts at legislating civil
rights, contended the editor, would
produce few lasting benefits for the
Negro while dangerous precedents
would be set, precedents affecting all
citizens.

But Kilpatrick, while maintaining
that the solution would be slow in
coming, suggested positive steps to-
wards aiding the situation—improv-
ing employment opportunities, im-
proving housing and general living
conditions, and providing better edu-
cational programs. These suggestions
lack the glamor of a “march for
rights.” Nevertheless, if the every-
day needs of the Negro are more ade-
quately provided for, the problem of
rights would diminish considerably.
And yet the fact remains: the solu-
tion will take time. There are no
shortcuts.

_. - Le A Practical, Economical

End To Phone Tie-Ups

BY MICHAEL L. HARRINGTON

If one has ever tried to use any camp

us phone, dorm or fraternity, during an

ordinary afternoon and evening at Davidson, he will sympathize with the two char-
acters in the cartoon disgusted with waiting forever.

There is an alternative for
the phone shortage at David-
son—a phone for every room.
Economically a phone for

every room is not a ‘‘pie in the
sky, by and by” dream; it can
be done for a reasonable ex-
pense. Southern Bell Customer
Service Representative Charles
Hill supplied THE DAVIDSON-
IAN with cost estimates he
termed “pretty close to the ac-
tual amount."

Other schools of greater size
than Davidson have phones in-
stalled in every. room at student
option. In this area such schools
include Emory, Duke, and UNC
at Chapel. Hill. While figures on
the cost of their operations are
not available, .it can be safely
assumed that their college ad-
ministrations thought the pro-
ject economically sound.

’ For a school the size of Dav-
idson to undertake this enter-
prise may seem the height of
madness, but several considera-
tions make it necessary. We are

Good Performance Boosts
An Extremely Poor Play

BY PETE MYERS

Three blind mice,
Three blind mice,
See how they run...

But these mice did not run,
and there were only two — two
old ladies, Mrs. Letitia Turn-
bill, played by Lucy Johnston,
and Miss Crystal Hower (Nancy
Copeland).

These nice, old ladies were
government employees (in the
Office of Medicinal Herbs), un-
til Senator. Kruger — C. W.
Stacks — abolished the depart-
ment. But four and one-half
years later, they were still go-
ing strong, due to a slip-up in
Congress. Trouble came,
though, in the form of the State
Department. the Army, the
Navy, and the Air Force.

Enter our hero. Tommy
Thurston, played by Neal Bush-
oven, who, out of “compassion”
for his ex-wife's two old aunts,
decided to combat the evil
forces intruding upon the quiet
Georgetown mansion that. hous-
ed the O.M.H. ;

The stage is now set: all the
characters are there, except
the ex-wife. Karen Norwood
(Carol Barber) — and her new
fiance, Dr. Henry McGill, play-
ed by Woody Cleveland. Now
the action begins in a burst of
farce, directed against Govern-
ment bureaucracy, among other
things.

“Two Blind Mice’ is an enter-
taining play. Lucy Johnston and
Nancy Copeland do an excel-
lent job of playing the two
ladies running the O.M.H. Their
movements and expression were
very good. Especially after the
play warmed up a little, they
stole the hearts of all the au-
dience in their quiet, batty way!

Neal Bushoven and Carol Bar-
ber (yes, Mr. Barber's wife)
were great in their supporting
roles. Neal had good expression
and, of course, good timing.

In her debut on the Davidson

stage, Carol Barber showed
what acting ability she possess-
ed. The only thing lacking was
projection, She dropped a few
lines, but her timing and facial
expressions more than made up
for that!

These four roles carried the
play; the two old ladies with
their childish ways and senti-
mentality, Tommy in his exu-
berance, and Karen in her sav-
‘age animosity toward her ex-
husband.

In the minor roles were Alex
Bernhardt (Major John Groh,
USA): Richard Trudell as Wil-
bur F. Threadwaite, Depart-
ment of State: Bill Foster, Lt.
Col. Robbins, USAF; and Dick
Forrester,. Commander Thomas
-Jellico, USN. Outstanding
among these was Richard Tru-
dell, who again. convinced the
Davidson audience. that he is a
born comedian.

The bit parts were well-play-
ed. C. W. Stacks and Eddie
Craig, who played Ensign Jami-
son, courier for the OMH se-
curity force and nephew of
Senator Kruger, should be men-
tioned here. They did their parts
well, though, perhaps through
lack of experience, not as well
as possible.

Amidst this good acting, by
most of the actors, was a good
technical set-up. The set and
costumes were excellent. The
set was designed by Director
Rupert Barber, with the art
work being done by Preston
Faggart and Virginia Trudell,
who have already shown their
competence with the colorful
“Visit” sets.

In the sound department,
though, there was one innova-
tion that did not impress me at
all, The overture began with
the first four bars of our Na-
tional Anthem, and then just
stopped. By the time the au-
dience was on its feet, a little
voice came through the speak-
ers saying: ‘Thank you.” I
thought that this type of open-

ing. although original and per-
haps clever (not to mention un-
orthodox), was out of taste com-
pletely and never should have
been used.

Another fault in this produc-
tion, I thought was the choice
of the play itself. It was a de-
lightfully humorous production
of an extremely poor play. The
playwright, Samuel Spewack,
used a tremendous plot, but, to
get laughs, he used some of the
cheapest tricks known to
comedy writers~and he was
not the least bit subtle or apolo-
getic.

A question I asked myself as
the play ended was: Although
the play is entertaining, does it
really fit into the concept of
good, educational theater that
has. been expounded by the
Drama Department?

ldcated away from any nearby
metropolitan center with a
girls’ campus—our social life
from weekend-to-weekend is
mostly dependent on the tele-
phorie. Being located away from
any city also means a reduction
in the number of phones avail-
able for our use.

On this page is a box that
gives and compares costs be-
tween our present system and
the proposed new system. It
should be noted that the figure
charged per phone per month is
arbitrary; the college could ad-
just it to meet expenses.

The system of a phone in
every room would work like
this: each student or pair of
students would be given the op-
tion of a room phone. The col-
lege would be billed for the
phones and their use. In turn
the college would bill the stud-
ents having phones.

Each phone would be billed a
flat monthly rate for the use of
such a phone (this covers local
calls), extra for any long dis-
tance calls. The entire cost of
the operation could be subsidiz-
ed through student rentals, still
strictly optional.

At present the college is
charged at a flat $3.05 per
phone (tax-exempt) by South-
ern Bell. The probable cost
per room would not be more
than $8.00 per phone and more
likety closer to $4.00 per phone
per month. The increase cov-
ers rental cost of phone serv-
ice facilities (cable, etc.)

The installation cost would be
somewhat minor compared to
the cost of relocating oresent
facilities. Hill commented in re-
gard to this: “It would probably
cost more to put in Davidson's
existing facilities again than to
install a new switchboard and
hone-per-room facilities,"

There would be certain other:
operational costs besides nor-
mal monthly rental fees. The
college would have to pay for
an operator to work the switch-
board. Hill emphasized that this
job could be handled by trust-
worthy students who were prop-
erly trained.

In addition, the Business Of-
fice would have increased ad-
ministrative paper work, possi;
bly resulting in the hiring of
additional part-time help.

But the costs even here can
be supported by the individual
phone holders. The college
would go on paying for its
phones as usual; the cast of the
new phnnes would be met by
the student rentors.

This increase is mostly per
phone; even if only half the

rooms on campus had phones.
the cost would still be reason-
able for the student.

There is no loss of money in
this new operation for the col-
‘lege. Even the costs of instal-
lation could be defrayed by
, student phone rentals. There is
no financial loss for the college
and no prohibitive rental fee for
the student to have a phone in
every room.

Juilliard Quartet Presents
Concert Despite Difficulty

BY ROBERT MILLER

In spite of all the difficulties, the Juilliard Quartet presented an excellent con-
cert. Their plane was two hours late; the violist lost the last page of the Beethoven;
and the high humidity necessitated frequent tuning and extremely careful adjust-

ment during movements to

Nevertheless, none of these
obstacles was apparent in the
precise, incisive manner in
which they played.

The rhythmic and dynamic
structure of the Mozart K. 575
was well presented, but to the
detriment of the lyrical ele-
ments. The Andante, which
echoes the. composer’s song
Das Velilchen, suffered the most
in this respect; the quartet’s
tone is intense and ultra-refined
rather than warm and lyrical,
and the complete lack of rever-
beration in the auditorium only
increased the metallic sheen of
the performance.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Richardson’ Civil Rights

Demonstrators Condemned

GERRITSEN

Dear Editor:

As a former Richardson
Scholar (1962-1963) I still re-
ceive THE DAVIDSONIAN from
time to time and I almost spell
it now whereas I only used to
read the headlines while I was
in Davidson myself.

The college newspaper is my
only regular contact with Dav-
idson College and I am very an-
xious to keep up with current
events on campus.

The last copy I received con-
tained an account of the Char-
lotte march against racial seg-
regation. Now it is not in my

line to pronounce a judgment on
this kind of protest, but there is
something in connection with
this march that I want to com-
ment on, namely the participa-
tion of this year's Richardson
scholars.

The report in THE DAVID.
SONIAN said that almost all of
them took part which I suppose
to be correct.

What do these students think
gives them the right to show
open condemnation of a so-
clety into which they have
only recently been hospitably
accepted!

They have only been in North
Carolina a few months and I
would be greatly surprised if
all the Richardson participants

in this demonstration had ac-
quainted themselves thoroughly
on the origin and history of this
complicated problem prior to
their coming to the United
States.

Would it not be a much bet-
ter Hine of conduct for them
to read about the subject and
talk their views over with
American students and friends
outside the campus than to
Ansolently march in the streets
of Charlotte?

I think that what it boils down
to is that they believe that such
improper conduct will make
heroes out of them. Their action
has been an insult to Americans
and beneficial to nobody.

Robert H. Gerritsen

insure correct intonation.

a transitional work, showing
affinity for Mozart lyrically:
and for Haydn, formally; but
also having a harmonic tension
which far surpasses its prede-
cessors. The Juilliard Quartet
emphasized the latter quality,
and did quite a convincing job
of it.

The delicate use of rubato
(speed variation) and skillful
dynamic contrast also contri-
buted heavily to the perform-
ance.

It was in the Bartok, however,
that the New Yorkers shone:
the vicious attacks and cross
thythms of the outer move-
ments, and the haunting gypsy
melodies of the inner ones are
ideally suited to their formid-
able virtuosity and tonal quali-
ty.

The ensemble was flawless,
and the complex rhythms
were extremely well defined,
which added immensely to the

driving power of the work.

The encore, from a quartet
by von Dittersdorf, was witty
and charming.

This reviewer would have
preferred a concert which was
more suited to the Juilliard's
talents; there were several al-
ternate choices which would
have allowed them to put their
special feeling for modern music
into better use.

A possible suggestion for
the future: could not a cham-
ber music subscription series
be held in Hodson Hall? It
would provide enough variety
between programs to allow
more specialization within
concerts, and also utilize the
superior acoustics and air
conditioning of Hodson.
Nothing of this kind has been
attempted in Charlotte. and the
large audiences for the Komitas
and the Juilliard demonstrate
the evident interest in a series
of this nature.
