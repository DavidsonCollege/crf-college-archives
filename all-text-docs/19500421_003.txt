VECTOR HURLING PROFESSORS AND EVEN «+

RULESLIDING SAGES CAN BE HUMAN

By ROGER W. CLAPP, JR.

“If the vector v is the velocity of
a rotating fluid, the curl of v, v x v,
is twice the vector angular velocity
of rotation, and the divergence of
v, v-v, is zero.” (1?1).

Ordinarily the average advanced
physics and/or mathematics major
at Davidson is expected to swallow
doses of this kind under threat of
an “F” or because, if he fails to nod
his head sagely, his professor will
look upon him with withering con-
tempt.

But then, maybe the boys pictured
here are not just “average” or
“normal”, It has been mentioned
that they are math and physics
majors. Possibly, then, these suck-
ers, er, uh, geniuses, are a little out
of the ordinary, especially since
they learn such things as that glib
mouthing above without even be-
ing required to learn them.

It is hard to believe, but true.
Yes, pictured on this page you see
two of the scenes common to the
voluntary Math-Physics Seminar in
Vector Analysis that meets every
other Friday night at the home of
one of the professors. -

The idea of having such a group
meeting was conceived in the hope
that the Junior and Senior students
might have a chance at real self-
expression and also a chance to
commit a coup d’etat by conducting
a discussion with some of the pro-
fessors as their students. The give
and take is a man-to-man affair
and the professor-student relation-
ship is relegated to the background.
It is most refreshing to see one of
the boys tell one of the professors,
whose classes he attends during the
week, that the idea he has on that
27th problem is not so hot and here
is the way it ought to be done.

Drop in any time between 8:00
and 9:00 P. M., at your own risk,
and you will probably be hit square-
ly between the eyes with a sliding
vector or nearly scalped with a
diverging curl.

Maybe Bruce Jackson will be
trying to convince Bill Clapp that
he has the wrong slant on that
triple scalar product; or maybe Fro-
fessor Pietenpol will be defending
his point of view on the dynamics
of a system of particles against the
aggressive doubting of J. B. Stroud.

At any rate, the blackboard, set
up for the night on two antique
chairs for which a use has finally’
been found, will be covered time
and time again with symbols that
might appear to most people to be
something out of a Chinese secret
code.

And so the session goes on, with
students and professors presenting

problems in the vector notation,

sections from the vector analysis
text, and any unexpected idea which
might arise.

Now if you are just a social but-
terfly and are not capable of hold-
ing up beneath the burden of thick-
piled mathematical ideas, you had
better take in a movie and then
drop in about 9:30, By then, the
chalk is usually wearing thin, and
it is time for Warren Herron and
J. B. Stroud, who are head cooks
for the night (though often the pro-
fessor's wife very competently takes
things in hand), to hie off to the
kitchen to get the coffee: hot and
the pie and ice cream combined in
the proper proportions, Charles
Burrus, “Charlie Miller and Prof.
Martin waste no time relieving un-
due strain from the sagging refresh-
ment table.

In the meantime, a cut-throat
bridge game gets under way’ in the
front room with Prof. Pietenpol
and Alan Fanjoy bidding six spades
and daring Prof. Fulcher or. Bob
McLeod to double. Naturally they
double.

Prof. McGavock, of course, has
by this time set up a chess board
and has challenged one of those
who aspire to play the past-time of
kings to command the opposing
forces. Warren Herron, who boasts
a better-than-average chess game,
as well as being one of the top
bridge players in the college, ac-
cepts the challenge.

Prof. Mebane dubiously looks in
on the game and remarks that he
had rather be a checker champ than
a wood-pushing chess amateur.
This immediately brings a challenge
from Bill Clapp and out comes the
checker board. Prof. Peyton, or
rather part of him, momentarily dis-
tracts the attention of Prof. Sellars
and the rest of the peanut gallery
watching the checker game. Be-
hind the checker board, J. B.
Stroud grins as his horse, red,
romps home a full length ahead of
Otis Milner’s yellow.

Prof. Fulcher, with a black cigar
that proves. he is still a man who
can “take it,” has by now reached
the detailed description of the 8th

points not always straight line.

Excess Legal Talent

Forces Aspirants to
Seek New Fields

Law graduates seeking employ-
ment this year will meet exceed-
ingly stiff competition in most
areas, according to a study made
by the United States Department
of Labor's Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics. The legal profession was al-
ready overcrowded in 1949, when
twice as many lawyers passed the
bar examinations as in the years
just before the war. In view of the
unprecedented number of students
now in law school, the number of
new graduates will remain high for
the next 2 or 3 years at least. Many
young lawyers will probably be
forced to turn to other fields of
work in which their legal training
may be an asset. Top-ranking stu-
dents, however, will continue to
find openings with relative ease.

Over the long run, the legal pro-
fession will probably tend to ex-
pand slowly, as a result of popula-
tion growth and of numerous econ-
omic and social trends which tend
to increase the need for legal ser-
vices. Deaths and retirements of
lawyers — which are roughly esti-
mated at around 4,000 or 5,000 a
year — will also create openings.
The tendency toward overcrowding
in the profession is likely to con-
tinue, however, unless legal servic-
es are made available to greater
numbers of middle-and lower-in-
come people through the exten-
sion of such plans as the legal aid
society or the Jawyer reference
plan.

Opportunities for specialists are
often better than for lawyers in
general practice. However, such
positions are comparatively few in
number, and are usually found on-
ly with big law firms in the larger
cities. Specialties with relatively
good prospects in the long run are:

hole in yesterday's golf game with
Prof. Blythe. Prof. Pietenpol and
Alan Fanjoy at the bridge table
look extremely doubtful as Fulcher
explains how he played his 3rd shot
off a dandeloin where it had miracu-
lously come to rest.

About 11:00, as the last record
of Beethoven's Piano Concerto is
spinning to a conclusion, as the
coffee is drained to the dregs, and
as Prof. McGavock squeaks by with
a narrow victory (or, in a not at
all unlikely turn of events, Herron
turns the tables on his professor
and pulls a checkmate on him), the
group then begins to break up. —

McLeod cranks up ‘Old Betsy,’
those who put their faith in a more
conservative mode of travel pile
in with Prof. Martin, and the Ad-
vancement of Learning is halted
for another fortnight.

tax law (thorough knowledge of
accounting is necessary and govern-
ment experience helpful), patent
law (scientific or engineering train-
ing is often required), administra-
tive law, admiralty law, and. inter-
national law. Legal training is be-
coming increasingly useful for many
types of business, and for adminis-
trative positions in Government, it
is also a great asset to people seek-
ing public office.

Best opportunities usually lie in

medium-size and smaller cities, es-.

pecially those with prospects of
economic expansion. State capitals
and county seats may also offer rel-
atively good opportunities. The
profession is especially overcrowd-
ed in the very large cities and in
Washington, D, C.

Information on how several thou-
sand law’ school graduates of 1946
and 1947 obtained their first jobs is
available from a survey conducted
by the B'nai B’rith Vocational Ser-
vice Bureau. The survey shows that
about one-third of the 1947 grad-
uates applied to only one prospec-
tive employer and that approxi-
mately the same number applied to
6 or more prospective employers.
Veterans appeared to have only a
slight advantage over non-veterans
when it came to finding jobs. Half
the 1947 law graduates had obtain-
ed employment in less than 2
months after graduation; however,
18 percent had to wait 4 months or
longer for their first Iegal jobs. It
took women much longer than men
to obtain legal positions.

It should be noted that the grad-
uating classes of 1946 and 1947 were
looking for jobs at a time when the
employment situation was relative-
ly favorable. The small number of
law graduates during the war years
had brought about an unusually
large number of openings for new
entrants. Excellent business condi-
tions also contributed to the de-
mand. Since 1947, competition for
employment has greatly increased
and it will probably become keener
in the next year or two.

stayed on in the Far East until March of
1948—specializing in Air Intelligence.

Back home, after accepting a Regular Air
