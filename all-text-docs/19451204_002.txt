Our Gift Fund.....

This week many students will be crit-

the cause to which Davidson's
traditional Gift I*und is to be lent this

icizing

year. But before any of you condemn it,

let me say these few words to you.

of War in Germany; they have coribut-

given

Yes, Davidson has done some mighty_fine
services with these Christmas GiftTunds.
The Y.M.C.A. Cabinet this year has en-
deavored to place before you, the students,
faculty, and townspeople of Davidson
another worthy cause.

This cause is an excellent one. To aid
fellow-Christians the
places of the world appeals as one of the
finest, if not the finest, thoughts thé
could enter one’s mind. And this thought,
this dream, is being placed betore us and

in most remote

all we have to do is sign our name toa
couple of pledge cards and go on our mer-
ry way. Then, after the holidays, when
our money is stacked up high again, we
can give a part of it for some less for-
tunate Christian.

For some it will be easy, for others it
will not. But to each and all-students, fac-
ulty, townsfolk, Christians everywhere
I urge you to give and give freely of what
you have. Thanks will not be yours, only
peace with God and yourself.

There has been much talk about a
school dining room, but not much has been
said of the advantages of it... The school
has a dining room in the basement of
Chambers which could easily hold the stu-
dent body if arrangements could be made
for more chairs and tables. The present
system of having boarding houses is
found by the student, expensive. Now

when one goes off for the week-end he
still pays for his meals at-the boarding
house even though he #sn’t there. Also if
he wishes to miss breakfast he still has to
pay for it: Whereas in the dining room he
would only pay tor the meals which he
actually ate. At some boarding houses
fhere’are complaints about the condition
of the food, in other the help, and in still
others the surroundings, Alt ot these pro-=
blems could be solved with one main din-
ing room, The preparation of the food
could be supervised by an accredited dieti-
cian, the help could be handled easily by
the school, and the location is right in the
center of the campus, and when deco-
rated attractively it would be a great asset
to the school.

In the winter-time one has to rush
through the cold to the boarding house, in
some cases a great distance, gulp down a
breakfast and then rush back again for
the first period class. But how does this
sound? A short walk over to Chambers,
“a good breafast leisurely eaten, and then,
since you are already in Chambers, you
can go to your class quite comfortably.
It would be this way all around the clock.
This might also solve any bickering about
fraternity men, eating off by themselves.
In the dining hall the student body would
all be together. There would be no dis-
tinction, and it would create a sense of
unity among the students, This project
would—have to handled correctly,
though, for if it isn’t it will backfire and

be
be worse thas the present system.

Concert Series Petition...
Davidson College has for a long’ time
needed to include in its student activity
fee a small sum of money to be set aside
for the purpose of pramoting a better

concert series for the student body and in-

_terested friends living near the college

But only after the students’ affirmative
voice concerning this could it be brought
about.

The time has now arrived when we can
say that we want to have a better concert
series, and that each student will do his
part in providing for this. Probably you
have already read the petition that Phi
Mu Alpha is sponsoring, and if you hav-

The N. C. Theta chapter was en-
larged this past week by the formal
iniation of Bob Millar, David Gamb-

tion was enriched by the presence of
Mr. Harry Griswell, Province Arc-
hon, Mr. E. F. Lucus and Mr. M.
S. Hill of the Greensboré Alumni
Chapter.

the “Broken-Heart Club”, This puts
him in with Strickland, R. Gambrell,
and Dickey, who have long been
meinbers in good standing. Too bad,
Millar! Maybe you should consult
J. Mac or Richert. They seem to be
doing all right. Which tonight, J.
Mac—Charlotte or New York?

R. Strickland spent this week-end
in Atlanta. I wonder if Jeanetta W.
was home from college or if he
really went to see the Ga.—Ga, Tech.

Maybe we shouldn't talk though
for he does all right at Queens.

the Kappa Sigs for lending them
the famed record, “Lollypop’. Yes,

‘ sign that petition you are asking for what

we think will lead to an outstanding con-
cert series. It is psychologically bad to
have to approach students in the middle
of the school year requesting them to buy
tickets to the series. And if this amount
was already included in the student act-
ivity fee then we would have the privilege
of attending all the fine concerts free of
admission. It’s a thing that we’ve been
needing for a long time; and so won’t you

Last week Brother George Patrick,
now with the AAF, was on the cam-
pus making plans for reentering
Davidson next ,semester. Brother
Patrick and Brother Morrow were
stationed about ten miles from each
other in Italy last winter, but the
Army kept it a secret from both
of them until last week.

Pledge Brothers used the Wood-
bury Forest trip as’ an excuse to
spend a week at his home... , One
of the brothers arranged a typical
blind date for Brother Campbell the
other night, a stick of gum with

never forget who dated her.
