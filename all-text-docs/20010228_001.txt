Administration denies
allegations made in
mysterious e-mail

By Brent Byars
Staff Writer

Last Wednesday, Davidson students, re-
ceived a mysterious e-mail making serious
allegations about labor practices at the school.
The e-mail stated, among other things, that
staff members of have no labor union. It also
charged, more importantly, that staff mem-
bers had been discouraged in the past from
forming a union. It called upon students to
begin a campaign “to
rectify the problem.”
A second e-mail from
the same address pro-
vided a link to a web
page that provides
more information
about the campaign.
These e-mails and the
claims they made pro-
voked concerned re-
sponse from both stu-
dents and college ad-
ministrators, who cat-
egorically denied
most of the e-mail’s
allegations.

Headed by the sub-
ject “Davidson Col-
lege doesn’t want you
to know”, the e-mail
was signed “Anna Th-
ompson” and declared
the writer “Founder,
People’s Labor Advo-
cacy Organization.”
Students who followed the link to the web
page (which wasat press-time up and running
at http://www.geocities.com/laboraction/)
found an angry document attacking the labor
practices of the administration at Davidson.

The document, which is decorated with
wildcat paw prints, fails to provide any spe-
cific charges, but instead relies upon “sources
among the staff who do not feel comfortable
being named.” It, among other things, states
that “staff members were encouraged to re-
tire early, or be fired,” and that there have
“allegedly been cases where a staff member
has raised legitimate grievances, then be fired

reasons.”

A mass e-mail encouraged
labor protection for college

staff “have the right to a union that would
protect their rights.” It calls upon students to
e-mail President Bobby Vagt, make fliers and
involve the faculty to continue the campaign
to secure labor rights for college employees.

In response to an e-mail to the campaign,
Thompson provided more information about
the charges she made. She stated that she
knew of school labor practices because of her
connection to a relative, who is a staff mem-
ber. However, she failed to provide any

‘ specific details about
any attempts to orga-
nize a union, instead

allegations.

Because of
Thompson’s claims
and student concerns
over her mass e-mail,
Vagt stated that al-
though he could not
comment for past ad-
ministrations, “There
has been absolutely
no attempt on the part
of this administration
to stifle anything.”
Vagt rejected the idea
that administrators or
supervisors had at-
tempted to discourage
forming a union. He
emphasized that “the
effort here is to make
certain as best we are
able that our salary
levels, benefits, and general working envi-
ronmentare the very best we can afford for all
employees of Davidson, without regard to
whether or not there is some formal organiza-
tion.”

Vice President for Business and Finance
Robert Norfleet also defended the school’s
labor practices, saying that he “is not aware of
any attempts whatsoever to form a union at
Davidson in the last thirty years.” He added
that non-faculty staff members are repre-
sented by the Administrative Advisory Coun-
cil and by a smaller group of “Office Support
Staff” that meets from time to time. The AAC
is a “broadly representative, voluntary group

Former Defense Sect. will
visit school in spring

By Linpy BALDWIN
Staff Writer

The Wearn Endowment has made it pos-
sible for several prominent speakers to visit
Davidson’s campus. This spring, Davidson
prepares to welcome Joseph Wearn Lecturer
William Cohen, the former Secretary of De-
fense.

Cohen, a Maine native, served as an elected
official for over thirty years starting with his
1969 election to the Bangor city council. He
was elected to three terms as a Congressman
beginning in 1972 before moving up to the
Senate, where he was a member of the Senate
Armed Services, Senate Intelligence and
Governmental Affairs Committees.

During his time in Congress Cohen ac-
quired a reputation for his independent think-
ing. He was one of the first Republicans 'to
call for Richard Nixon’s impeachment, and
in 1987 he signed a paper placing the blame
for Iran-Contra on President Ronald Reagan.

In late 1996, Cohen was preparing to retire
after three Senate terms when President Bill
Clinton appointed him to the post of Secre-
tary of Defense. Despite Cohen’s Republi-
can affiliation and his statement that he might
disagree with Clinton on certain national
security issues, Clinton called Cohen “the
right ‘man to secure the bipartisan support
America’s armed forces must have and clearly
deserve.”

The Senate unanimously confirmed Cohen,
and the moderate Republican immediately
set to work by presenting the FY 1998 mili-

_tary budget to Congress. Cohen stressed the
need to improve military morale by increas-
ing pay and making more amenities such as
child care available to soldiers.

Cohen also emphasized modernization and
the need for American military superiority.

To that end, he recommended a round of base
closings in 2000-2001 to help the Pentagon
conserve funds for modernization.

In addition to financial issues, Cohen faced
controversies over peacekeeping missions in
volatile areas such as Bosnia. He was also
involved in talks with Russia about US plans

_for a missile defense system. Finally, Cohen

frequently had to deal with rising social ten-
sions in the military — racism, sexual harass-
ment, and homosexuality — in the face of
intense public interest.
