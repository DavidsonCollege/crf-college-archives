The Whitewater scandal continues

By Brett Marston

On Friday, independent coun-
sel Robert B. Fiske, Jr. ordered top
administration officials to appear
before a federal grand jury which
is investigating various criminal
charges in connection with the
failed Madison Guaranty Savings
and Loan.

Further, White House Coun-
sel Bernard Nussbaum resigned on
Saturday, denying that he had done
anything wrong, but claiming that
the burgeoning scandal makes it
impossible for him to fulfill the
duties of his job.

Nussbaum’s resignation
comes as a response to recent
charges that he violated ethical
standards by meeting with Trea-
sury Department officials to dis-
cuss a confidential federal investi-
gation into the Madison Guaranty
S&L.

After the suicide of Clinton’s
friend and White House aide
Vincent W. Foster, Jr. last July,
Nussbaum came under fire for
withholding Foster’s papers from
federal investigators.

Here are a few of the basics in
this confusing and complicated
story:

eIn 1978, Billand Hillary Clin-
ton and their friends James and
Susan McDougal created the
Whitewater Development Corpo-
ration and bought land along the

White River.

By all accounts a shady char-
acter, James McDougal is the
former owner of the Madison Guar-
anty S & L, which cost taxpayers
around $50 million when it went
bankrupt in 1989.,

*Critics charge that Clinton
used his political influence on
McDougal’s behalf and that
McDougal “paid” Clinton by loan-
ing him and Hillary money through
Madison and other banks which he
owned, as well as by paying her
law firm a $2,000 retainer.

In an interview with the Los
Angeles Times (quoted in the
American Spectator ), McDougal
claims, “I hired Hillary because
Bill came in whimpering they
needed [financial] help.” White
House aides have denied
McDougal’s claim.

* In 1985, Clinton appointed
Beverly Bassett, another of
McDougal’s lawyers, as Arkansas
securities commissioner, who,
among other things, is in charge of
keeping tabs on S & L’s. Appar-
ently, Bassett did not keep a close
watch on Madison, and she ap-
proved several Madison ventures
which upon closer investigation
appear questionable.

Further, Arkansas municipal
judge David Hale, himself facing
charges of financial wrongdoing,
contends that Clinton pressured

him in 1986 to make a loan of
$300,000 through his investment
firm to help out McDougal, who
was facing a federal audit.

“If Hale is telling the truth,”
writes Lynn Chu in the March edi-
tion of Commentary, “Fiske will
have to decide whether Clinton’s
request might constitute criminal
solicitation and extortion.”

¢ Allegations have also been
raised that McDougal took money
from Madison investors without
their consent and contributed it to
Clinton’s gubernatorial campaign
in 1985,

Other charges against the
Clintons include that they lied on
their tax returns by claiming larger
deductions than those to which oy
were entitled.

Fiske will need quite some
time to untangle this mess. In the
meantime, however, it is already
clear that Whitewater has hurt
Clinton’s reputation, and that it
provides some handy ammunition
for his political opponents.

Whining American children

What is missing from all of the bravado, brinkmanship, sound-
byting, and table-pounding emanating from Tokyo and Washington]
over trade imbalances is a sober look at the facts. . . .

When American car makers don’t even put the steering wheel o
the right side of the car for Japanese drivers and then complain that theid
automobiles are being blocked, one can see that, at times, to Japanese}
ears, it seems that Americans are acting like whining children.

In the interests of free trade and to protect the soaring yen, which]
would create long-term problems for Japan’s own exports, Japanese}
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should do all he can to let more
American cars in. The result will probably be that the American —_
get wiped out in the market and there will no longer be any reason for
American griping.

Cuffed and stuffed for ditching school
Those school officials in Philadelphia don’t mess around with}
anyone playing hooky. Undera new policy, police will pick up truants,
search them and put them in handcuffs before dragging them down to
one of wix truancy centers in schools around the city. . .

During the hours that classes are in session, authorities will try to
round up stray youths in public places and take them to truancy centers,
where school counselors will try to help find ways to keep them i
school. Authorities say handcuffing truants taken into custody i
standard procedure, but it is a practice that has generated understand
able protest.

Britons debate future of royal family

By Meredith Strong

The question of whether the
tradition of the British Royal Fam-
ily should corry on would have
been political heresy not that long
ago. However, the future of the
British monarchy is in debate
nowadays. The Royal Family has
been a symbol of Britain’s glori-
ous past and its present exception-
ality and today many Britons think
it should be abolished all together.

The reason for this question is
a result of the recent scandalous
activities involving membvers of
the royal family which have gretly
damaged their reputations. For the
first time, the scandals have opened
serious discussion of constitutional
issues centering on the rights and
perrpgatives of the monarch. Al-
though, there is little doube that the
media, and especialllyu the tab-
loids, have had something to do
with this disillusionment.

It isn’t worth it to the British
taxpayers to keep the Royal Fam-
ily going for a sum of ouver $15
million a year in revenue. The
queen onlyu just began to pay in-
come taxes in April of 1993. How-
ever, she is still one of the richest
women inthe world. Young people
today are realizing this so it is
likely that we will see some parlia-
mentary change in the near future.
Aeventeen percent of the popula-
tion of the United Kingdom be-
lieve thay would be better off
withou the Queen. Yet nothing
boosts newspaper slaes all over the
world more than a new scandal
invlolving the Princes and Prin-

cesses of the House of Windsor.
Not to mention the royal family
being one of England’s biggest
tourist attractions, especially for
Americans.

The question of whether or
not Price Charles, heir to the throne,
should become king is of. course a
favorite topic of debate. After all,
the King of Englandis the spiritual
head of the Church of England, the
face on currency and stamps, the
convener of Parliament and the
role model for families all over
Britain. The debate is whether
Charles, who has had an alleged
extramarital affair with miss
Camilla Parker Bowles, can pre-
side as “defender of the faith” when
he succeeds his mother to the
throne. And if he does this, will
Diana become queen? Should he
and Diana divorce, he can still at-
tain the throne. There is also the
question: whether the monarch is

disuniting the nation by being the
head of onlyu the Anlican denomi-
nation and none others in England’s
ecumenical society.

Many think the royal family
should skip a generation and put
Charles’ son, William, on the
throne when Elizabeth II ceases to
be queen. But even then William,
like many of us, is a product of
separated parents and this culd
possibley have and effect on his
ability to lead the nation.

The British are a strange lot.
Their newpapers andtelevision are
filled with gossip and assertions
about the Royal Familyu and thwy
give much less attention to their
Prime Minister, John Major. In
my opinion, five years debation
the monarchy would be five wasted
years. Finally, as their naitonal
anthem now goes, in the future
God may no longer be able to dave
the gracious noble queen.
