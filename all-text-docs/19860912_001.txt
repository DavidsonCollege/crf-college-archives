Sour second half spoils football opener

By SUSAN WILKINS

Despite losing to Lenoir-
Rhyne 31-14 on Saturday, David-
son’s football team is “approach-
ing the light at the end of the tun-
nel,” according to head football
coach Vic Gatto. «

Led by senior quarterback
Steve Bradley’s 213-yard aerial
assault, Davidson opened a 14-3
lead at halftime.

_ Lenoir-Rhyne scored first
with a field goal following a forty-
three yard drive in the first quar-
ter.

Davidson came back during
the second quarter, scoring twice
—once on a 18-yard pass from
Bradley to junior wide receiver
Aaron Edwards and then on a two-
yard run by sophomore running
back Bryan Overcash. Senior Jack
McCollum kicked both extra
points.

Unfortunately, the second half
was a different story altogether.
Lenoir-Rhyne scored once in the
third quarter to cut the Cat’s lead
to 14-10. ‘

Davidson then made their only

big mistake in the game, fumbling
the ball on their own 23-yard line
to set up a _ Lenoir-Rhyne
touchdown at the start of the final
quarter. Lenoir-Rhyne then ran
toughshod over the Cats, scoring

-on their'next two possessions, and

proceeded to win the game 31-14.
Bradley played well for the
Wildcats, completing 19 of 39 at-
tempted passes for 211 yards with
no interceptions. Freshman quar-
terback Peter Hughes, whom
Gatto calls “quick and exciting,”
played briefly, completeing three

of five for a total of 17 yards.

McCollum also plays at the quar-
terback position; he led the
Wildcats to last season’s win over
Wofford.

On the other end of Bradley’s:
_ passes were senior runriing back

Mike Jones and Edwards. Jones
caught five passes for 51 yards
and Edwards caught five for 53
yards. kdwards was aiso David-
son’s leading rusher, running for
41 yards in five attempts. Begin-
ning what will hopefully be a

sterling season for him, freshman

Senior Billy Waitsman nabs one

Eric Crowley returned three kic-

koffs for 75 yards.
Playing tough on defense for
the Wildcats was junior

linebacker Howard Humphries,
who had seven unassisted tackles
and five assists to lead the team
with twelve tackles during the
game. Senior Marcus Allen, who
played linebacker for Davidson
last year, is now playing on the de-
fensive line. He had a total of
eight tackles. Senior defensive
back Doug Neil and senior strong
safety Gary Stewart had nine tack-
les apiece. Freshman linebacker
Ken Nazametz showed promise
by pulling down seven Lenoir-
Rhyne players.

Another plus for the Wildcats
is the fact that they only lost one
fumble the entire game. This is a
big improvement over last year
when Davidson had nine fumbles
in a game against James Madison
University. Although not happy
with the loss, coach Gatto said
that “we (Davidson) didn’t play
ourselves out of the game.”

Gatto said the loss of junior
noseguard Emmanuel Burch (due
to academic ineligiblity) hurt the
team, But the quality of the
freshman recruits pleased him.
The freshman this year are his first
recruits and many are seeing play-

ing time. Four freshman start on |

the defensive line and four played
on offense. Although this year
may not be a winning one for the
Cats, Gatto thinks that with one
more goad recruiting year, David-
son’s football team could'be on its
way up.

Davidson’s next home game is
this Saturday against the Wofford
Terriers. Last season McCollum_—

Senior Steve Bradley

21-17 win over the Terriers and he
will probably start for Davidson
this year in hopes that he can again
lead the Cats to victory.

Wofford is a strong team and
is heavier down the line than
‘Davidson. However this is not an

unusual situation — most teams.

will be bigger than the Cats. Gatto
says that his team is in excellent
condition; with only Allen injured
(pulled hamstring), the team.
hopes: to repeat its 1985 win over
the Terriers.

Davidson starts its Southern
Conference schedule’ the follow-
ing Saturday (Sept. 27), playing at
East Tennesee State. The
Wildcats finished above ETSU
last year in Southern Conference
standings and if they’re going to

win any conference games, this

will be-the one. Their other con-
ference games are against Ap-
-palachian State, who was the pre-
season favorite in the Southern

I-AA, Marshall and Furman, last
year’s national runner-up. All of
these games ate on the road.
Other home games for the
Cats are Oct. 11 and 18 against
Bucknell and Lafayette. Both of
these teams are members of the
Colonial Léague which Davidson
will join in 1987. Hopefully this
league will be ne in which
Davidson can be Competitive.

The last game of the season for
the Wildcats is on Nov. 15 when
Davidson hosts Catawba. These
three games could go either way
for the Cats, depending on how
quickly the freshmen develope.

Although Gatto does not hold
high hopes for this season, he does
think that with a lot of work,
