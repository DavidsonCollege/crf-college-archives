funds for its operation from the
Activities Fee Committee.

Many members of the Activi
ties Fee Committee questioned
the value of a Wildcat Hand-
book because regulations con-
cerning student conduct are now
published by the College. In
past years this was the pri
mary functioning of the Wild-
cat Handbook, and the Publica
tions Board is debating whether
one will be published next year.

In the event that a Wildcat
Handbook is published the com-
mittee tentatively gave it $1.-
600 which was an increase from
$1,325 from last year.

The Residence Hall Associa-
tion had a surplus of $223 from
last year’s appropriation of
$985. It’s $1,177 request was cut
to $1,050.

The Black Student Coalition
had $483 left over from its $650
appropriation for last year. It
requested $316.50 and received
$300.

The total requested by or-
ganizations this year was $40,-
469 and $37,625 was appropriat-
ed. Each student will be contri-
buting $37.62 to these organi-

zations as opposed to $37.30 for

1970-1971.
