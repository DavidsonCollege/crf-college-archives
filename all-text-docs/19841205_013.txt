Some of our classrooms
arent classrooms.

An environment that chal-
lenges your physical and mental

skills will be your classroom in
Army ROTC.

River rafting. Rappelling.
Orienteering. Cross country ski-
ing. Water Survival. Mountain-
eering.

You'll find it to be an ex-
cellent course in leadership de-
velopment, as well as adventure
training.

Whatever the experience,
Amy ROTC will teach you to
think on your feet. To make im-
portant decisions quickly.

Add Army ROTC to your
college program and you auto-
matically add a new dimension
of excitement and adventure to
your campus life.
