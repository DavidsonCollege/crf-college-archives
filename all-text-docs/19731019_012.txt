derstatement of the saddest
sort.

The wise men of the ages
have called these your ‘golden
years’ and insofar as op-
portunities for a foreign ex-
perience are concerned, their
evaluation is beyond dispute.

It is most unlikely that you
will ever again have the chance-
especially for those pre-
professionals who will be
moving into graduate school - to
absorb another culture through
the osmatic process of living in,
rather than simply traveling
through, it for 10 to 12 months;
and with all due respect for the
wisdom one gains from travel,
there can be no substitute for
living, suffering, laughing

went to classes.

The last would have been
your average, pleasant cookout
had it not been for the
Generosity of the townspeople,

who dipped into their private
stores when the wine ran out,
and before long there was
singing and dancing in the
streets.

And before classes would
start we took off for our first
taste of real travel in Europe.
Braving the prospects of hitch-
hiking where you don’t know the
country and maybe not even the
language or riding the train in a
land where the national sport
seems to be railroad strikes, we
headed for Paris, Mont St.

Michel, Geneva, Zurich,
Heidelberg, Amsterdam... and
around.

We did find time to attend
weekly excursions into the
surrounding countryside -
medieval abbeys, Roman:
aqueducts, an authentic life-
and-death bullfight and a
mussel roast in one of those lit-
tle fishing villages where they
head for the sea during the
week and for the table on Sun-
day.

culture.

The sort of perspective one
can gain - not only about the
mother country and our own
‘colonial land’, but even more
significantly about other people
in general (with their hopes,
fears, aspirations) and about
himself, as a unique individual -
is simply incredible.

The British National Union of
Students - of which all ‘foreign’
students are members - con-
ducts a phenominal program of
excursions, planned holidays,
and extremely cheap student
transportation to cities all over
Europe and even to the Eastern

Hemisphere.

Travel aside, though, it is the
people one meets, the friends
one makes, and the insights one
gains into another culture and
into himself which makes the
experience so enriching.

A million and one other con-
siderations come to mind. The
overall nature of English
university life provides a

serves to be

Many an unaccomplished
American sports fan has
astonishingly blossomed into
the realm of ‘jockdom’ in
English volleyball or basketball
with only the most marginal
talent.

The ‘pint’, and the pubs in
which you drink those pints, are
most worthy institutions and
would merit your full con-
sideration any evening between
6:00 and 11:00.

The consideration, however,
which any interested freshman
or sophomore should take to
heart - and to mind - most
deeply is that he needs to begin
planning now, if he is to make
the above dreams his own ac-
tuality. The year is there; it
awaits you; make it count!

students are on mining scholar-
ships and come from the
wealthy Copperbelt Province.

In 1971 copper prices fell on
the world market and the entire
revenue base of the country was
effected. The University was
forced to cut back on the
already scarce staff, professors
and students.

General dissatisfaction by the
students led to a protest against
French arms sales to South
Africa in that same year. Zam-
bian President Kenneth Kaunda
had seemed to encourage the
protest. But when rocks were
thrown at the French embassy,
students were rounded up and
the University shut down.

Student dissenters of the only
national political party were
imprisoned and were only
released early this year. Since
then student opposition to
Government policies has been
mild, especially since the
Government personally finan-
ces many of the students.

Ugandans escaping General
Amin’s terrorizing tactics and
refugees from the Biafra-
Nigeria civil war are common.
Black residents of Lestho,
Swaziland, Botswana, Angola
and South Africa are also
noticeable.

Zambia's University reflects
the buffer situation the nation
as a whole endures between
white, racist southern Africa
and the independent black
nations to the north.

Professors come from the
U.S., Poland, Britain, Uganda,
USSR, Sweden,’ Nigeria,
Yugoslavia, India and Ceylon.
Their contracts are termed for
two or three years at the most.
The rapid faculty turnover rate
makes long term planning
nearly impossible.

Teaching theories and per-
sonalities often conflict. Studen-
ts have a saying that when two
elephants fight, it is the grass
that suffers. Besides confusion
on teaching objectives, students
have to contend with the
numerous attempts at English,
the national language.

... Management

(Continued from page 2)
John M. Bevan admitted the
pre-managerial speakers in the
Conference Schedule were a
sort of trial balloon, intended to
gauge student interest in

t.

Ratliff thought increased in-
terest in a formal pre-
managerial program might
also be due to difficulty of

ining admission to medical
and other professional schools.

Management is not just open
to majors in economics and
related fields, Ratliff em-
phasized. ‘*Most MBA
programs have almost no
course pre-requisites’’ he
added.

Nor is pre-managerial iden-
tical to pre-business. Ratliff ex-
plained that an administrator of
a foundation or private
educational institution is just as
much a manager of resources
as an executive involved in the
market sector of the economy.
mittee is set up, Ratliff said it
definitely should include faculty
from outside the economics

department.

Only two of every 1000
primary schoolers ever reach
the University level. Therefore,
the students are an elite within
the society. For obvious reasons
many of the students do not
wish to return to their village
homes.

Students desire further study
in the U.S., England, USSR or
China, and they often do not
return. This brain drain affects
all of Africa. In many instances
the villages raised money to
build the University but the
students do not return to im-

prove rural life.
There are 73 languages in
Zambia alone. ‘‘Tribal’’

associations are quite strong. It
is not uncommon to find the
Bemba sitting together in the
cafeteria or the Lozi joining
together to form a rock band.

University social life is quite
diversified as in any of our
universities. The main preoc-
cupation, especially with the
first years, is dating.Lusaka
night life is expensive so the
usual outing is for a beer and a
football match at the student
canteen.

Movies are frequent and
everyone knows of Steve
McQueen, John Wayne and
Sophia Loren. Black en-
tertainers from the States are
particularly followed. Nearly
everyone knows each Muham-
med Ali fight by heart. Black
poets and authors are also very
popular.

Writing, photography, music,
and dance associations provide
the cultural expression of the
nation as a whole.

Catholicism, Protestantism,
Hinduism, Islam and Existen-
tialism are all found on campus.
Because of their militancy, the
Watchtower sect of Jehova’s
Witness has been banned from
the country. All of the
denominations work in close
harmony to provide a spiritual
atmosphere and needed social
services.

Zambians have a great love of
all sports, especially soccer. If
Zambia can beat Morocco and
Zaire, she will represent Africa
in the world Cup tournement in
Munich, and the nation is
terribly excited.

Behind closed doors, many

- students smoke dagga, the local

marijuana. Harder drugs have
not found their way appreciably
into the country, but fears are
that this aspect of
Western culture will enter along
with the movies, dress, dance,
and magazines.

hair, short skirts and any~ pic-
tures depicting ‘‘the new
culture’. It is reported that a
visitor to Malawi has 30 minutes
to get a haircut above the ears
or else he will be placed on the
next plane out.

Sex in the dorms is
widespread. Increased student
pressure has been put on the ad-
ministration to relax visiting
hour regulations. Calls for
family planning services are
also called for in student
publications.

The University of Zambia is
much like any university in
America. Students are
struggling to gain a greater
voice in university affairs, and
the University is struggling to
become a major force in the
development of Zambia.

this way.

‘But you can look at flunking
a course two ways: either as a
punishment or a discipline to
the student. I prefer to look at it
the second way.

‘‘As our present system is set
up, the student has _ two
penalties for flunking a course,
namely a lower grade point
average and no course credit
given.

Our proposal just gets rid of
one penalty, since in making up
the flunked course the student
has to add on an extra course to
satisfy credit requirements,”
Canterbury pointed out.

Canterbury also indicated
that the failed grade would
remain on the student’s
academic record, but not
averaged into the GPA.

This type of program,
moreover, would only be of-
fered during the regular school
year.

‘“‘Our computer statistics
showed that most flunking
grades were made by Fresh-
men anyway, and that the in-
troductory courses are the most
frequently failed, indicating
that a lack of knowledge of the
course’s requirements, bad
study habits, and poor advising
are key factors involved in
failing grades,’’ Canterbury
said.

If successful in the Senate this
coming Tuesday, the proposal
will be sent to the Educational
Policy Committee for its ap-
proval, and finally to the faculty
at large to vote on pending the
EPC’s passage of it.

POETRY CIRCUIT

A new literary season is soon to blossom at Davidson as
John Fields is slated to grace Love Auditorium, Tuesday,

In an hour long presentation, Fields will portray American
poet Walt Whitman at three distinct junctures in life, youth,
puberty, and maturity. The representation will not want for
authenticity as Fields will affect outward semblence and

‘‘Leaves of Grass,”’ published in 1855, is Whitman’s main
work and has been acclaimed as probably the most in-
fluential single volume of verse in American literature. He is
known as the father of free verse.

The same week, Barry Spacks, a renowned writer of poetry
and fiction, will deliver a poetry reading in the Rathskeller,
Wednesday, Oct. 24 at 8 p.m. Spacks wil also entertain a few
classes Thursday at 9 a.m. in room 335 of Chambers. Spacks
is most noted for his novel ‘‘The Sophomore” and his collec-
tion of poems, ‘““‘The Company of Children.’’ He is currently a
teacher of literature and writing at M.I.T.
