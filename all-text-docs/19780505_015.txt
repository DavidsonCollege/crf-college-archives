Every year Bad Bernard and
Hogman take an in-depth look
at girl’s sports here at DC, and
then follow up with a full report
on which players and teams are
doing the best. We would like to

humbly apologize to all our
readers tor waiting so long to
complete this study, and we
want to especially thank the

Davidson girls—they have too
much class.

This has been pretty much of
an up and down year for Girl’s
IMAC sports at Davidson. The
flickerball season was particu-
larly exciting as a record num-
ber of teams forfeited out of the
league in the first week of the
season.

Basketball season was quyite
a shock. . . two teams actually
made it to the finals of the
tournament without forfeiting

iout or having hair appoint-
ments.

Softball season, unfortunate-
ly, has turned our similar to the
flickerball season with the old
problem of too many teams and
not enough players. It seems
that this has turned into a
serious problem and several
solutions have been proposed to
get the coeds out of the kitchens
and back to the IMAC fields.

According to nationally
known feminist Betty Freidan,

Everything clicked for the

Wildcats last weekend as Da-

placed 6th in the Southern

alternative other than to igno-
miniously clamber over the top,
slosh through the water, and
resume the race.

Meanwhile, Phil Gilbert’s
22-5 placed fourth in the long
jump and several Wildcats had
qualified in the sprint and
hurdle trials.

Friday ended with Davidson
in 5th place with 19 points, and
the squad, after an intensive
carbo-loading session (i.e. the
consumption of record quanti-
ties of pizza and ice cream,) haa
good reason to be optimistic
about its chances in the next
day’s events.

Saturday began with a sixth
place from the 440 yard relay
team of Gilbert, Robert Alston,
Terrazzo Wallace, and Dick
Jones.

Horn then blitzed the equiva-
lent of a 4:16 mile and finished
sixth in the 1500 in a school

record 3:59.03. Freshman Greg |

Bernard did not place but ran a
personal best of 4:12.

Alston’s 3rd place (11.02) in
the 100 meters must have been
an unpleasant surprise for op-
posing coaches, as none of them
could have even heard of him
before the meet. The short
powerful freshman joined the
team two weeks before the
championships and proceeded

offs, group sex, etc.

We think both of the solu-
tions are excellent ideas, and
think that they should be
incorporated immediately.

The IMAC tournament hast

gotten under way, and several
big upsets have already been
reported. The Old Men, our
number 5 team going into the
tournament, were rudely awa-
ken by The Cavenaugh Kids.
After the game The Old Men,
with their heads sadly down in
their hands, were seen heading
down to the welfare office to
collect their social security
checks.

Disco Dave Shi, one of the
youngsters of the team, looked

place 6th

to demolish nearly everyone he
faced. Alston placed 4th in the
200 in 21.77 shortly thereafter,
and Gilbert, who had qualified
for the finals by virtue of an
acrobatic lean at the tape in the

semi-finals, placed 6th in 22.35. @

Pinckney ran another superb
race in the 5000 and placed 3rd

impressive 55:12 to finish 4th in

and the mile

another season's best.

Overall; Coach Karl Krem-
ser’s team had a much improved
season, finishing 6-1 and set-
ting school records in 5 events.
The season is not entirely over,
however, as the Bill ‘‘Geek’’
Gaynor Invitational Mile Run is
slated for Friday afternoon at
4:00 p.m. The Geek has vowed
to break the elusive 5-minute
barrier in the mile, and a large
number of his teammates will be
pacing him. Coach Norm Kol-
ler, who will be attempting to
defeat the Geek, and M’tata,
the ridiculous team dog, are
also entered. Dr. David Grant
had been elected ‘“‘Miss Geek
Invitational’’ for 1978 and will
be timing the event. Refresh-
ments will be served immediate-
ly after the race, and everyone
is encouraged to come out to
help pace or cheer the Geek on.

forgets. He didn’t go to college,
he went to Furman.

Presto’s Grill continues to be
plagued by their inconsistent
play. Jack Griffeth, team cap-
tain mused after the game, ‘‘I

-just can’t understand it. Some-

times we go out and play well
and we win. Other times we go
out and play bad and we end up
losing.”’

Presto’s nipped the lads from
Dartus Tunic and then let it go
to their heads as they dropped a
game to the Whizz Kids in the
second round of the tourney.

Dartus Tunic, behind my
great play, continues to roll and
looks as if it won't lose until it
gets beaten again. We would
like to congratulate Dave Wil-
liams who was awarded Fly
Beta Kappa at a private cere-
mony last week. Also be sure
and vote for Phil G. for UMOC.

The SAEs set a new IMAC
record last week as .they scored
24 runs in one inning. A coed
was heard saying after the
game, ‘‘I don’t see what the big
deal is, I had 30 runs in one of
my stockings after a game.”

The E Baggers also sent 30
men to the plate in that famous
inning. Mike, I want a green

The Lizard Kickers have risen
from out of nowhere (maybe the
SPE house) to become a major
factor in the IMAC softball
tourney. Bernie and Hogman
feel that they could either win or
lose, but look for them to do one
of the two.

MacFleet and Stuff continues
to win despite their inadequate
talent and mediocre groupies.
John Ratliff is still one of the
wierdest looking people we have
ever seen, and we question just
how good a softball player he is.

In the volleyball world the
outspoken group of nerds that
call themselves Slauol have
added 14 more players to their
roster to bring them to the
grand total of 37 players. Team
spokesman Graeme Thompson
said that ‘this isa new strate-
gy. If there is no room for the
ball to land on our side of the
court, then we can never lose a
point.’’ Good Luck Graeme.

The Bong’s Last Chance is
still undefeated behind the
great play of ferocious Lou
Ortmayer. Rumor has it that
Clayton Rogers might get the
Most Improved Player trophy
at the upcoming volleyball ban-
quet.
