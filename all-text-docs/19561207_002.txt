‘Steve’ a Symbol to Free World

A young refugee straight from the
rubble-filled streets of Budapest stands
out in our mind in a week jam-packed
with an almost unbelievable array of color-
ful personalities visiting the campus.

Wearing pants torn from hitting the
ground to avoid being shot down by bor-
der guards during his flight into Austria,
his sadly quiet smile vanishes when
queried about his wife and family. They
remain in Budapest. His face is sober as
he explains that he has had no word since
his flight three weeks ago.

It is for them that he must conceal his
identity, and be only known as “Steve.”

Steve bears the air of a man who has
spent his young adulthood under. the
shadow of brutalism and atrocity, not
dance weekends and overdue term pa-
pers.

He tells of the blinding flash of rockets
landing around him one night three weeks
ago as he hurried through the darkness
toward the border and freedom. while we
studied for reviews.

He grimly speaks of the rape of grand-
mothers and five-year-old girls by the
Russian soldiers, and of the insane shell-
ing of empty Budapest homes.

Yet through it all, Steve's sense of.
humor has remained intact. When the
language barrier became too great, he of-
fered a Hungarian-German pocket dic-
tionary for assistance. Asked how he got
along with an all-female audience at
Queens, his comment was, “Ah, funf hun-
dert pretty girls!” in the first English
words he used all day.

His constant companion was a Vienna
version of the College Outline Series,
“Englisch in 30 Tagen.”.

And now Steve has returned to New
York to continue to speak for the people
of Hungary to the people of. the United
States. Then in the next few weeks he will
go to work for an architectural firm in
New York City.

Steve is an exception to the rule. Most
of his contemporaries still remain, if not
in Hungary, then on the Austrian side of
the border, ready to fight again.

His countryman, Dr. Szentivanyi, has
returned to Waynesville before beginning
a speaking tour up and down the Eastern
‘seaboard.

Here at Davidson, the Gift Fund is of-
ficially underway. No project has ever re-
ceived the impetus given this one. Never
has student interest run so sincerely deep.
Never before has the whole community
asked in on a student fund-raising pro-
ject.

The prospects of Christmas at home
with all the traditional food and fellow-
ship can't help but seem a little tainted at
the thought of young men like ourselves
living in the ruins of Budapest without
food or fellowship.

A Hungarian family here will be a
symbol of our belief in the dignity and
freedom of man. This is a chance to show
the stuff of which we like to think David-
son is made.

These people gave their lives for free-
dom. We should be able to spare a few
dollars.

RF.D. Must Realize Responsibility’

Don Oberdorfer, the Charlotte Obser-
ver’s chief political writer, came to David-
son Monday evening to cover a story, a
big story, Radio Free Davidson.

Reared in the deep South, Oberdorfer
attended Princeton University where he
was editor of the daily student paper. A
respected journalist, Oberdofer covers
top stories for the Observer. When he
heard about Radio Free Davidson, he
realized that it could be a powerful story,
and indeed it could have been just that.

Aided by a photographer, Oberdorfer

visited Davidson to interview the found- -

ers of the college’s first and only “radio”
station. Then he waited around for its
broadcast to begin. What he heard in fif-
teen minutes surprised and shocked him.

Oberdorfer, hardened to the facts of
life by his reporting experiences, and
himself not too far removed from college
life, was disillusioned and disappointed
by R.F.D.

Like so many others in the outside
world, Oberdorfer believed Davidson to
be what she says she is. Although this
might be debated in some respects, the
events of Monday night did not help her
reputation any.

What he heard from R.F.D. was fifteen
minutes of prejudice and off-color humor.
Had Oberdorfer written the story of
R.F.D. just as it happened, Davidson
would have received a smear that would
have taken it another one hundred and
twenty years to live down.

Such a story might have been picked
up by the wire services, and in a matter
of hours Davidson could have been front-
page news all over the country, but not
in a very favorable light.

Think of the ammunition that just
such a story would have provided North-
ern radicals who seek every opportunity
to crucify the South. Unfortunately Ober-
dorfer did not find at Davidson the kind
of story he thought he would.

Radio Free Davidson can be a good

thing. Already it has captured the fancy
of the student body. It is democracy in
action, the voice of the students. But
there are certain limits which the opera-
tors of R.F.D. must not So beyond. There
is a certain responsibility that goes with
Radio Free Davidson which its operators
must respect.

To those of us who are so intimately
tied up in the Davidson way of life R.F.D.
may seem like a harmless joke. To an im-
partial observer, however, R.F.D. is Da-
vidson at its worst, not its best.

To be funny does not require being at
the same time distasteful. Good clean
fun can be had without sinking to the
level of Monday night's broadcast.

Davidson may thank her lucky stars
that a man like Don Oberdorfer covered
the story,'a man who had enough decency
not to write what would of necessity been
a story of indecency. —A.W-F.B.

Pledges Bleed
For the Lady

Apparently pledges “bled for the
lady” at an unprecedented rate this week.

The Interfraternity Council is to be
commended for an unusually effective
handling of the whole affair. 365 pints is
considerably more than was donated in
both drives put together last year.

The drive was notable for the strong
support given by the individual fraternity
chapters, most of whom had active get-
out-the-blood campaigns.

R.O.T.C. and P.T. cuts, along with a
dollar reduction on Midwinters ducats
plus a plaque to go to the fraternity with
the highest percentage of donors, all
helped to spur enthusiasm and competi-
tion.

MAN WITH A MESSAGE

Evangelist Preaches Repentance

And Salvation to Whole World

By TOM CUTTING

Billy Graham has captured the
hearts of the American people as
no other Christian evangelist in
our history. There have been more
newspaper and magaziné articles
about this man and his work than
any other preacher in our country.

People from all across the
United States have flocked to hear
his message. His ministry has not
been confihed to a limited area.
In the last five years he has taken
his evangelistic crusades to impor-
tant places in Europe and Asia.

During the Korean, War, he
spent several weeks during the
heart of winter seeking to bring
encouragement and salvation to
the hearts of our fighting men.
Every place he goes, whether in a
large American metropolitan cen-
ter or an insignificant little village
in India, his message is the same.

PREACHES REPENTANCE

He preaches a gospel of repent-
ance and salvation. It is his con-
viction that Jesus Christ is the

PRESIDENT’S DESK |

DAN LaFAR

PRESIDENT OF THE
STUDENT BODY

In an attempt to make a sur-
vey of the actions of the Student
Government over the last few
weeks several things should be
noted. In the realm of old busi-
ness, the Council was pleased with
the manner in which the Court of
Control was handled this year both
from the standpoint of freshmen
and of upperclassmen.

Acknowledgement and apprecia-
tion were extended to’ the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities con-
cerning their having extended the
Friday night dance weekend cur-
few to 4:30.

Perhaps the most significant
facet in the form of things new
has been the monthly meeting of
the Student-Faculty Conference
Committee. This is a group, out-
lined in the Student Body Consitu-
tion, that is composed of five
members from the student body
and five from the faculty.

The students are represented by
the Davidsonian Editor, the Senior
Class President, and the Student
Body President and two Vice-pres-
idents. The Faculty representation
consists of the College President,
the two Deans, the College Treas-
urer, and an elected member of
the faculty.

Thus far this committee has been
very successful in discussing prob-

answer to our world problems. On
his coast to coast radio and tele-
vision program, his constant theme
is that our nation was founded up-
‘on Christianity and it can only re-
main strong as the American peo-
ple seek and do the will of God.

In our generation and those pre-
ceding us, there has been much
comment about the evangelist
who is in the- ministry for
monetary gain. It seems that the
most critized part of the evange-
list’s program is his handling’ of
offerings and expenses.

Iems of mutual interest, and it
is the hope of each member to be
able to contribute to the overall
good of Davidson through this op-
portunity for an exchange of
thoughts and ideas.
s e¢.h6©8 e e
The Student Council has taken
a definite stand by expressing its
intention to carry out the wishes
of the Student Body. By removing
three students from the dormi-
tories for the remainder of the
first semester for violations of
the Student Body Regulation re-
garding dormitory conduct, the
Council feels it is making evident
its intent to enforce the rules of
our Student Government.

Along this same line the Coun-
cil has made clear in Student Body
Meeting its interpretation of the
gentlemanly conduct section, and
its regard to vespers.

To say that a student who in-
terferes with the worship of an-
other constitutes ungentlemanly
conduct would seem unnecessary
but the definition is made for the
sake of clarity. I hope each mem-
ber of the Student Body will heed
this position the Council takes in
re-pledging itself to a conscienti-
ous enforcement of the Student
Body Constitution,

Billy Graham can not be censured
for his failure to use properly the
offerings given to him by the
American people. Two years ago
Time magazine published an arti-
ele which told of the excellent
manner in which the Billy Graham
Evangelistic Associ ation has
solved this problem. This is one
of the reasons for Billy Graham’s
success among our people.

NOT LACKING FOLLOW UP

Another fault of many revivals
in America has been the lack of
a sufficient follow up program

for the new converts. People have
said that they are forgotten when
the revivalist. leaves town.

Mr. Graham has devised a plan
which goes into effect after the
actual crusade has been completed.
This has proved successful in

counseling the new converts and.

helping them become active in a
church of their community..

Billy Graham comes to David-
son College as a man with a mes-
sage for our time. This message is
that Jesus Christ is the Saviour of
the world.

Last week “Steve The Visiting
Hungarian” was informed in his
second language, German, that his
audience at Queens College would
be composed solely of women.
Wildly  gesticulating he cried,
“Mein Gott!”

Ah, yes, true wisdom certainly
knows no nationality.

e s * Cd] e

Wednesday at dinner, the bilin-
gual Hungarian glanced through
Grier Davis’s First Year German
Text Book. He noted that the uni-
versal routine used in one of the
stories (“Miss, Is this the pencil
you left in Biology class? No, kind
sir, I don't take Biology, but would
you like to come up to my flat for
a cup of tea?") has survived even
in surpressed Hungary.

(Has anyone seen a “Bleistift”
with Eva Gabor’s name on it?)

The latest in “Stalinisms” mak-
ing the rounds in Budapest con-
cerns the large statue of Uncle
Joe that was seen in last week's
Life. The truth of the matter, ac-
cording to Steve, and he was there,
is that ropes, bulldozers, and cut-
ting torches could not phase the
bronze giant. Finally success was
achieved when one of the students
placed a U. S. dollar at the foot of
the colossus. You guessed it, kid-
dies! When old Joe bent to pick
it up, all of Budapest kicked Joe
you-know-where, and Mr. Stalin bit
the dust in an awesome fashion.

PROFESSOR DOUB KERR

Personalized Giving
Aids Creative Writing

By JOHN BERNHARDT

Davidson is proud to have on
its campus this week one of its
most loyal alumni, Professor Doub
Kerr of Glendale College, Cali-
fornia.

Prof. Kerr entered Davidson in
1911 and remained until 1913. At
that time he left to take a special
language course at the University
of North Carolina more in line
with his choice of specialization,
and in 1915 he graduated from
there with honors.

SHOWED LOYALTY

Unlike other of Davidson's dis-
tinguished alumni who did not re-
main for the full four years, Prof.
Kerr immediately showed his
loyalty to his part-time alma mater
by returning to institute some
changes he felt were needed.

Though he intended to teach
languages, he had an active in-'
terest in creative writing, and, hav-
ing profited at Carolina from mem-
bership in a society encouraging
creative writing, he felt his other
school should also benefit from
such a group.

Therefore, in the same year that
he graduated from Carolina he
helped found the Blue Pencil
chapter of Sigma Upsilon at David-
son.

Since 10929, Prof. Kerr has taught
Romance languages at Glendale
College in Caljfornia, in his spare
time writing much both for publi-
cation and for pleasure. Despite
this preoccupation at his new
school, he has always managed to
maintain his interest in David-
son.

The enthusiasm of the Student
Body over thé YMCA’s proposed
project for this year’s gift fund
is extremely encouraging to those
of us who hear so much cynicism
about “Christian Charity” being
bandied about in student conversa-
tions (a polite term for bull ses-
sions).

It is hoped, however, that the
‘members of the “Y" Council and
the college authorities will be able

Immediate Change
Would Be Unfair

Dear Sir:

I have been glad to note the pro-
gress of the agitation to change
the foreign language requirement
for the A.B. degree from four
years to only two. The present re-
quirement is obviously, I believe,
antiquated.

Some have suggested, however,
that the requirement change be
made in time for members of the
present senior class to receive an
‘A.B. degree with only two years
of foreign language. I feel that an
immediate change would be un-
fair to a minority of the present
senior and junior classes.

Some of us came to Davidson
seeking an A.B. degree. When we
discovered in the catalogue that
the school required four years of
foreign language, we planned our
schedules accordingly so that we
might meet the requirement.

In many cases the two extra
years of foreign language involved
a sacrifice of two electives which
the student would have preferred
to take but chose not to take in
order to earn the A.B. degree in
accordance with the printed re-
quirements.

As I said, the requirement
change is needed. But to allow the
change to benefit members of the
senior and junior classes who were
not willing to make the “sacrifice”
of taking the two extra years of
foreign language would be to do
8 real injustice to those who were
willing to do so.

The requirement change should
apply to the present sophomore
class and all succeeding classes
because the members of these
classes have not already begun
their third year of foreign langu-
age in order to meet the A.B. re-
quirement. .

He established the Willa Cather
award for creative writing, and
for many years has been giving
a valuable prize of books for the
outstanding work submitted to him
from Sigma Upsiton.

This year he established a new
award, the Woodrow’ Wilson, to
run in conjunction with the Willa
Cather and to be awarded for the
outstanding piece of creative re-
search. The value of this second
award should do much toward
stimulating interest in historical
and literary research at: Davidson.

This fall Prof. Kerr retired from
teaching, and for the purpose of
renewing his acquaintance with
the college as well as personally
encouraging its creative program.
He is here on the campus this week
for visits and lectures.

HAS MADE IMPRESSION

Every institution should be
proud of its traditions and should
seek to instill that pride in its
members. It is because of that
pride that we here at Davidson are
able to enjoy such .things as
scholarships, modern buildings,
and relatively low tuition.

However, there are other gifts
which, though on a less grandiose
scale, may involve even more con-
sideration, interest, and sacrifice.
It is in this type of giving that
Prof. Kerr has made such a deep
impression on Davidson. He feels
that creative writing should be en-
couraged, and in the strength of
that conviction he has materially
aided the broad educational pro-
gram of the school.

FROM THE TOP

of the

DOME

with
NAT DANIEL

to make the Hungarian family’s
presence in Davidson an _ educa-
tional and intellectual, as well as
a charitable project.

In view of this desire, it is sug.
gested that the family selected for
residence here be from higher
intellectual and cultural stratum
than a manual laborer.

He should be one who can, after
a period of language and environ-
mental adaptation, participate in
the intellectual life of the campus
in such a way that students and
faculty members alike may be able
to learn something from him.

We see very little of the college
maintenance force, local service

-Station attendants, etc., except in

a vague and impersonal sort of
way, and there is a real danger
that a Hungarian family of this
type might be pushed into this
same background after the novelty
wore off.

On the other hand, an educated,
intelligent businessman, universi-
ty professor, doctor, dentist, etc.,
would be more useful to the col-
lege and the community.

Such a person would be more
quickly assimilated into the com-
munity, he would be better able
to establish self-respect on the
basis of merit and achievement,
and he would be in a better posi-
tion to participate in a realistic
exchange of ideas between the
People of Eastern Europe and col-
lege students of Southern Ameri-

Davidson, 8s & preserver of
ancient (and sometimes obsolete)
traditions of Southern gentility,
has temporarily neglected one as-
pect of a tradition so prevalent
among private. endowed _institu-
tions of higher learning, with the
result that approximately ninety-
four students have become nonenti-
ties; they have a nameless home.

It looks as though it might be
a long wait, and although dorms
aren’t named in a day, the resi-
dents of “New” feel left out, sur-
rounded as they are with the many
memorials to Davidson’s benefac-
tors such as Watts, Shearer, Belk,
Grey, Chambers, Richardson,
Ovens, Martin, and Duke.

We protest this delay, and sug-
gest that the new dormitory be
named “Rumple”. This would pre-
serve tradition, give us a home
we could call by name, and return
to the campus the name of that
distinguished gentleman who made
no small contribution to David.
