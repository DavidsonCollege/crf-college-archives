Sunday

Burney, pastor of the

Creek Church, ad-
dressed attending the Sunday
night vespers on the subject of “ Loy-
alty to Self.”

After an organ prelude by A.
Wauchope, F. L. Smyre, who had
charge of the service, read the fif-
teenth Psalm as the scripture. L. W.
Pratt and F. H. Scott led in prayer.
W. Edwards rendered the beauti-

Mr. Burney is an alumnus of David-

and from there accepted the call to

* Traumerei”
at the

the pastorate of the Sugaw Creek
Church.
He began the discussion of his

theme, “Loyalty to Self,” by pointing
out that our loyalty has much to do
with’ our attitude toward life. He
showed that\the thing which we call
self is really Vastly more than the va-
rious physical sensations which we
know. Self goes back into the realm
of the intellectual, and further still into
the realm of the spiritual. We were
made in the image of God, so loyalty
to self is loyalty to God and to the
principles Christ, the great expo-
nent of true self.

The speaker showed that today we
long for freedom but are in complete
ignorance of its real meaning. True
freedom is a loyalty to the Master of
men; the striving to gain a Christ-
like self. As a criminal tries to hide,
so we try to hide our sins from the
light, not so much because we are
afraid of public opinion but because
our better selves are striving to tram-
ple under foot our lower nature.
.Mr. Burney stated that to be truly
loyal to self we must exercise ethical
constancy in the great issues of life.
He showed that to be truly loyal to
ourselves we must learn that God cares
for others. We need only to look at
the suffering in the world about us to
realize that we must strengthen our-
selves to live in a world with human-
ity.

He closed with the thought that we
need only to call on God to have the
Master Touch placed on our lives. He
illustrated this by the story. of an old
violin which was up for auction, but
because of its worn was
passing almost unnoticed. Then a man
came through the crowd and, taking
the violin in his hands, began to play.
The crowd was awed into silence and
after the man had ceased playing, large
bids were brought forward. The mas-
ter touch had been applied.

Announcement was made that Dr.
D. P. McGeachy, of Decatur, Ga., will
speak at the next vesper service on
the subject of World Peace.

At last the Baron Munchausen
comes to the screen, with Jack Pearl
and Jimmy Durante, Ted Healy and
his stooges, Zasu Pitts and Edna Mae
Oliver. The Baron, Jimmy, and Jack
Pearl are lost in the African jungle,
and the Baron gets away from the
party. When found, the people think
Jack Pearl is the Baron, and he goes
to America as a hero, with Jimmy as
his business manager. He speaks at
a girls’ school, and the Baron appears,
and the show gets funnier and funnier.
It should be very good.

A Correction

In last week's issue an article which
gave the enrollment of Davidson Col-
lege from different states listed West
Virginia as having one student here.
This should have been 26.

The mountain  state’s enrollment
gives it a tie with Florida for fifth
which also has 26.
