She Davidsonian

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Editor-in-Chief

Tuesday’s presidential election will be a three-way
race among a couple of junior senators who think and
vote alike and a 26-year-old ex Marine with virtually no
political experience.

The candidates are Phil Hazel, Dan Herd and Peter
Hobbie.

Both Herd and Hobbie have had extensive exposure
on the Davidson political scene; and their ‘‘me-too”
campaign for the presidency, predicted for weeks,
took on a new shape Tuesday night wheri Hazel, un-
tried and untested in campus political wars, took the
plunge.

Hazel is a self-proclaimed “conservative” on most
campus issues, while Herd and Hobbie are so-called
“liberals.” But on at least one important issue—fra-
ternities—all three stand together.

Hobbie, an Independent, and Hazel, an inactive fra
ternity member, both favor non-exclusive eating clubs.
Herd—an active fraternity member and called by some
“the court's candidate’’—ranks either a local system
with 100 percent bidding or eating clubs ahead of the
present social system.

On other matters, though, the three differ. On ROTC,
for instance, Hobbie and Herd, who voted together
on virtually every issue in this year’s Senate, favor a
voluntary program. Hazel wants ROTC required ‘‘for
at least the first. semester in the freshman year.”

Hobbie. a junior from Little Rock, Ark., has been

“Student recruiters from here have found it hard
to follow a professional recruiter from a place like
Harvard. We need one ourselves, and we should be
able to make the sacrifice financially for it.”

Freshmen Pledge
Despite Murphy

classmen,. 272 received fra-
ternity, bids. Another 19 have
joined fraternities through
the extended rush program.
Only nine freshmen did not
participate in rush this year.

Of the freshman class,
over 85 percent received
bids. According to IFC Pre.
sident Bobby Vagt. ‘‘There
was a higher percentage of
pledges than last year."

In the Tuesday chapel be.
fore rush began, SGA Presi.
dent Joe Murphy urged the
freshmen to look carefully
at the fraternity system.

He gave one after-rush
party to let freshmen meet
the inactives and Indepen
dents. On Sunday he sent a
letter to all freshmen urging
them to become social affili-
ates in the fraternities. Also,
the Independents published
a letter each day of rush.

Vagt said that ‘‘rush had
a more serious tone, A lot
more serious questions were
asked than in previous
years.’

Murphy, said it was ‘‘too
early to tell’ the effects of
his anti-fraternity move.

vice president of the student body and president of
the Residence Hall Association this year. He was a
sophomore representative on the old Student Council
and a Constitution Revision Committee member as a
freshman. He is secretary of the Spencer Commission
on Social Patterns.

His claim to fame rests with his reputation as a
champion of open dorms, through his RHA duties,
and as a critic of the fraternity system, manifested
in his leadership of the Independents during rush
last week.

Herd, a junior from Midland, Texas, is a senator
from the Junior Class and class president. He is Kappa
Alpha’s representative on the Interfraternity Council
and a freshman hall counselor.

This year he has also been in charge of the student
government’s student exchange program. He is a
political science major with intentions of going to law
school.

Hazel is a two-time Davidson flunk-out and ranks
last in his class. An economics major, he is an academic
junior and will graduate at the end of the second term
next year. Last term he had a “B” average.

Most of Hazel’s limited experience comes from his
presidency of the new Married Students’ Council, which
he, helped organize and make a respectable force on
campus. He works part time as a representative for
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company.

Hobbie is counting on four voting groups to carry
him to victory on Tuesday: the Independents, because
he is one; the freshman class, with whom he eats in
Union cafeteria; the junior class, which he led in last
year’s voting; and scattered support from fraternity
members.

Herd wil! be counting on the support of fraternity
men, despite his stand for an alternative social sys-
tem. He can also expect. considerable support from
freshmen, since he is a hall counselor, and from his
own’ class.

“My votes,” Hazel says, ‘‘ will come from the people
who know all three of us. I feel—and think others feel
—that Iam more capable of accomplishing what I set

out to do.”
HAZEL

“Compared to everybody else on this campus,”
Hazel says, “I’m what you’d call a conservative.”

“I see a stopping-point for changes, and I will never
believe that a student body singly or collectively can
be expected or should be expected to function as
administrators or administrative assistants.”

Hazel’s platform centers around his division of the’

college community into ‘three seperate but constantly
comingled groups”:

—Students and faculty: “they are both here to ed-
ucate and get educated.”

—Admir'‘strattion: “Its job is to establish and plan
and improve the environient.”

—tTrustees: who “ultimately decide what types of
policies will be acceptable for the college community.”

“Those are the groups,” Hazel says. “What we need
to do is to clearly define the roles they play, and to
make each group realize its primary responsibility.”

For the student-faculty group, for instance, there
should be a bigger voice in who “gets to join the col-
lege community,” Hazel says. Therefore, he proposes
to work for: student-faculty responsibility in the hiring
and firing of faculty members; student representation
on the Admission Committee and the trustees; .and
greater student participation in student recruiting.

About the organization of student government here,
Hazel says: “T’ll be perfectly honest with you—I don’t
know how many senators we've got right now.”

“J love it here, and it’s absolutely beyond me how.
students can come here and for four years agitate
for change. I'm for change—don’t get me wrong. I
just believe that students have neither the time nor
the ability nor the training nor the desire to be as good
as the people they're always bitching about, like Dean

Burts.”
HERD

The number one priority in Herd’s platform is in
admissions policy. “We need more diversity,” he says,
“but not at the risk of ruining our academic standards.”

Herd would do two things to boost diversity here—

The Candidates And The Issues-1969

The 1969 election is crucial.

The next student president will have to face a
student government long marked by inertia; an
electorate noted most for its apathy where drink-
ing is not concerned; a multiplicity of student
organizations determined that the student govern-
ment shall not meddle in their affairs; a college
administration attentive to students but seeming-
ly bent on getting its way in the end; an all-too-
often suspicious faculty; and, of course, a critical
DAVIDSONIAN.

The presidency will require time, at least twice
as much as the president can possibly give. It
will take political savvy, to the furthest limits
that that quality is known on this campus. And
it will take courage, a trait as scarce as women on
the campus and needed as badly.

With these things in mind, THE DAVIDSONIAN
presents The Candidates and The Issues—1969. . .

hire a professional recruiter and expand the student
recruiting program, “if that’s feasible.”

“Students recruiting from here have found it hard
to follow a professional recruiter from a place like
Harvard. We need one ourselves, and we should be
able to make the sacrifice financially for it.”

Two original planks in Herd’s platform call for a
cabinet to include virtually all the student body’s
leaders and a ‘‘campus confrontation committee” to
organize seminars and speaker programs.

The cabinet—“I call it my ‘think-tank’ "would be
designed to unify student leadership in an effort to
pool ideas and get something done. Theoretically, the
cabinet might include leaders such as the chairman
of the Social Council. a representative of the Five-Year
Fan Committee, editor of THE DAVIDSONIAN and
others.

In addition, among other planks, Herd is calling for:

—A juiced up Senate Executive Committee. “It has
been virtually neglected this year, and it should be
used.”

—More money for the student exchange program.
“The reason it’s been hurting is the lack of funds.
We can get the money if we submit the budget re-
quests early enough and make the demands.”

—Expansion of the role of student government.

HOBBIE

Hobbie’s platform doesn’t dip down into a lot of
specifics because “I don’t think it’s a good idea to list
point after point after point. When you do that, I think
you lose sight of what student government’s supposed

0 be.”

Instead, Hobbie offers a platform of two main-areas
~——a better organized and utilized government struc-
ture and a proper interpretation of the Code of Re-
sponsibility.

“All our good work in the Senate this year has been
hampered by a lack of organization,” Hobbie says,
“and it’s due mainly to the newness of the constitution.
Student government can be run more smoothly.”

The Code, he says, offers the best avenue to reform.
“If its pushed far enough, the idea of responsibility
can be used in itself. I like the phrase ‘responsibility
leads to reform.’

“Right now we're stuck with the idea that we're
responsible—yet we’re on the system that lets us cut
only a quarter of our classes and ‘The Memoirs of
Casanova’ is locked up in the library.”

_Although Hobbie'’s platform does not deal in spe-
cifics to any large extent, he has definite ideas none-
theless.

_ For instance, “you get the feeling that the admis-
sions program is doing nothing more than filling a
quota of Negro students. Three seems to be the num-

er.””

And on the matter of the campus social system,
he says he would like “to get all 12 fraternity presi-
dents together to ‘talk local.’ There is a place for
student government among the fraternity presidents,
and any change in the system should come from within,
not from the administration.”

. + Church And College

(Continued From Page 1)

son from the church.

William F. Mulliss, a Char-
lotte lawyer and a_ trustee
elected by the Mecklenburg
Presbytery, refused to com-
ment on any question con.
cerning Davidson and the
church.

He said “it would be pre-
mature to give any opinion"
until after the trustee-facul-
ty-student commission on
Church Relationship makes
its report.

Harllee Branch Jr. of At-
lanta. a trustee elected by
the Alumni Association and
chairman of the trustee
Committee on Campus and
Social life, was asked if he
felt that the ministers serv-
ing on the board were the
most liberal members.

“I have not detected at
any time nor on any ques-
tion an attitude that charac-
terize the ministers."’ Branch
said. The board can not be
split up and down any lines
of profession or vocation, he
said.

Asked to comment on the
college’s Self-Study Report
recommendation that the
Board of Trustees be reduc-
‘ed to about half of its pre-
sent size, Branch said:

“There is no magic in
numbers — it can be too
small or too large. I have
no opinion as to what is the
ideal size board.*

He pointed out that alumni
have not demanded a larger
voice in running the college.

When told that the. church
directly contributed about
$80.000 a year to the college.
and asked for his comments
on the disproportionate num-
ber of trustees elected in re-
lation to the amount, Branch

said that no church-related
school receives a large sum
from the institutional church.

But it would be impossi-
ble to say how much money
is given to Davidson simply
because itis either a Presby-
terian or church-related
school.

Charles F. Myers Jr. of
Greensboro. a trustee elect.
ed by Orange Presbytery and
chairman of the trustee
Committee on Finance, said
he had no particular com
ment on the recommenda
tion to reduce the size of the
board.

He said, “The smaller the
group, the better the action,”
but pointed out the advant-

age of a larger group for
public relations and com-
munication.

He said that he had found
the ministers currently serv.
ing on the board ‘extremely
flexible and liberal’ when
dealing with questions relat-
ing to Davidson and its stu-
dents, particularly in deal-
ing with questions of social
change on campus like the
Code of Responsibility.

He pointed out that the
President's Office does make
recommendations to each
presbytery as to the type of
men it would prefer to be
elected to the board.

Asked if he would ever
vote to sever the ties of the

college and the church,
Myers said that he would do
so if the situation ever arose
in which he felt that the
church was placing “unfair
and unrealistic pressure on
the college.”

The Rev. Albert B. Mc.
Clure of Statesville, a pres.
bytery trustee and member
of the Commission on
Church Relationship, said
that there was no stipulation
that trusteee representation
be commensurate with dol-
lar contributions.

When asked about the $60.,-
000 figure, McClure said that
Davidson's relationship with
the church was “‘not by any
sense a balance sheet."

Co-kditors Take Stand

“Print the news and raise
hell’’ has been the unprinted
motto of THE DAVIDSON.
IAN throughout recent years,
and this motto, combined
with a certain spirit of pro-
fessionalism among the staff,
has produced an excellent
newspaper, one which has
earned 13 straight All-Ameri-
can awards.

But that’s not enough.

Davidson's slow, deliberate
movement into the 20th cen-
tury is going to require that
the newspaper add both
depth and breadth to its
coverage. As the radio sta-
tion takes over the function
of providing immediacy,
THE DAVIDSONIAN will be
released and allowed to shift
some emphasis from straight
factual reporting to insight
articles and depth coverage,
but always maintaining a
careful accuracy and fair.
ness. Also, the scope of the

newspaper should be expand-
ed to include student-related
news from outside Davidson.
THE DAVIDSONIAN has
long been extremely cautions
not to compromise its edi-
torial independence, but it
has missed opportunities to
add to the effect of its own
editorials joining forces with
the student government.
Therefore, ‘although we ex-
plicity reserve and intend
to exercise our right to cri-
ticize the student govern.
ment and Senate as we see
fit, we will strive for more
coordination of effort in
areas of agreement.
Complaints over hapha-
zard_ circulation mounted
steadily throughout the last
term, until new. circulation
managers were appointed at
the start of the present term.
We will not let the situation
return to its state of last
term: THE DAVIDSONIAN

will be out and mailed on
time every week.

Since the quality of any
newspaper is dependent on
the qualifications and abili-
ties of its writers, we will
try to make available to as
many staff members as pos-
sible summer internships on
professional newspapers.
