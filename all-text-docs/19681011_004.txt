mittee,, and Director, of Ad-
missions H. Edmunds White.
Henschen _ said the pro-
gram has two main goals:
— To draw good students
to Davidson from diverse
economic and social back-
grounds — To publicize
Davidson more widely.
“Davidson has been criti-
cized as being too homo.
geneous,"’ said Henschen.
“The result of this situation
is the perpetuation of stand-
ard ideas and viewpbints.
This lack of diversity goes a
long way toward explaining
student apathy.”
He then pointed out the
procedures of the program.
A recruiter will deal with

several high schools near
his home.
During the Thanksgiving

break, he is to contact the
guidance counselors at these
schools to arrange for pre.
sentations about Davidson to
interested students during
the’ Christmas holidays.

Throughout his talk, Hen-
schen emphasized the im.
portance of recruiting stud-
ents with backgrounds dif.
ferent from that of the aver-
age Davidson student. The
search for qualified Negro
applicants was. given high
priority. .

Admissions Director H.
Edmunds White gave his own
outlook on the program. He
said that as far as educa-
tional and family back-
grounds are concerned, the
student body has a great,deal
of diversity already.

Davidson ts in no danger of a water shortage due to the
drought now affecting much of the state and threatening to
close the University of North Carolina at Chape! Hill. Davidson
Mayor F. L. Jackson explained that Oavidson’s

for 13 consecutive semesters.
“A beautiful job," said the
ACP judge. “What more can
one say?”

Tne judge singled out the
paper's news writing and
coverage and its headlines
for special praise, but noted
deficiencies in the technical
quality of its pictures and in

“We fully expect to win

toral College.” .

That was how Reid Stubbs.
state. chairman of Wallace
for President campaign. pre.
dicted the election results to
Davidson students at last
Monday's Open End.

Stubbs recounted what is
in his mind sweeping fed-
eral usurpation of state and
local powers, sellouts to for-
eign money interests, capi-
tulation to the enemy in Viet-
nam, and conspiratorial news
reporting by national news
media.

Although he was uncertain
whether Wallace was himself
a segregationist, Stubbs
claimed he did not know of
a single public statement in
which Wallace “reflected on
a man for his race or color.”

According to Stubbs, Wal-
lace sees the issue as a dis:
pute between federal and
local jurisdiction.

While admitting the civil
rights movement could have
made great progress with-
out Communist influence,
Stubbs maintained that there
is ample evidence of Com-
munist direction in the move-
ment. He asked the audi-

The committee attained
legal status last week wheh
the Town Council passed an
ordinance giving it authority
to take conciliatory action on
cases of discrimination in
Davidson.

Mrs. W. P. Cumming. a
new member of the commit-
tee, reported that so far al-
most $20,000 had been raised
of a projected $25.000 for the
Child Day Care Center to be
built adjoining the present
Child Development Center on
Jetton St.

“There are no really good
day care facilities for Negro
children’ now."" Mrs. Cum-
ming said. “The day care
center will provide more than
just.custodia) care ‘for child-
ren whose mothers’ work."

man of the committee, said

Balfour

By JIM BAILEY
Staff Writer

The leading dealer in high
school and college jewelry,
L. G. Balfour Co. of Attle-
boro, Mass., has been found
guilty of unfair competition
‘methods by the Federal
Trade Commission.

The Commission has issu-
ed a cease and desist order
designed ‘“‘to recreate the
competitive conditions which
the respondent's illegal mo-
nopolization eliminated."

Balfour is the sole dealer
for Davidson class rings and,
along with Burr, Patterson
and Auld, has most of the
sales for fraternity jewelry.

According to the commis-
sion’'s morning news release
of Aug. 28 Balfour has il-
legally used “‘official jewel-
er’s contracts’ to foreclose
most (86.9 percent) of the
market to competition.

Balfour has also employed
“active disparagement of
competitors and their pro-
ducts; the use of threats,
coercion and litigation to ef-
fect adherence to the ‘official
jeweler's contracts,’"’ the
commission said.

In addition, the commiss-
ion has found that Balfour
has deliberately tried to keep
secret its acquisition of Burr,
Patterson and Auld in order
“to preserve an aura of
extant competition.”

The Commission's news re-
lease concluded by stating
that evidence of Balfour's
“power to fix prices is clear-
ly shown by fraternities’ un-
questioned acceptance of
price and quality changes

instituted by Balfour."
