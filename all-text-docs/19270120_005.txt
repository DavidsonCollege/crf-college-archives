THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 20, 1927

Four Big Pictures |

to be Shown Soon

Again.the “Y"” has booked some of the
best pictures of the year for showing at the
college. On the 22nd, this coming Saturday,
“A Little Journey” will be here. The next
Saturday “The Scarlet Letter” will be shown.

On the following Saturdays will be shown |

two of the best films that could be booked,
namely, j
and “Tell It To the Marines.”

“A Little Journey,” with Wm. Haines and
Claire Windsor, is a very good comedy about

a boy and a girl and their love making on a |

trans-continental trip.

“The Scarlet Letter,” with Lillian Gish in
the lead, is one of the year’s biggest pictures.
It was taken from Nathaniel Hawthorne's

”

great novel of the same name and has all the |
drama, beauty, and tenderness of the book. |

In it Lillian Gish achieves her greatest emo-
tional triumph. Victor Seastrom, the direc-
tor, has made a film masterpiece, a picture
worthy in every sense of the beautiful Lil-
lian Gish. She is ably supported by Lars
Hanson, Henry B. Walthall, and Karl Dane.

Ronald Coleman and~Vilma Blanky, in
“The Winning of Barbara Worth,” presents

a great drama taken from the book by Harold |

Bell Wright. .‘‘Tell It To the Marines,” with

Lon Chaney, William Haines, and Eleanor |

Boardman, is a fine comedy. In this comedy |
Miss Boardman surpasses her fine work in
“Bardeleys the Magnificent.”

The “Y” now has a contract with the Da-
vidson Orchestra to play at every show.

Dramatic Club Broadens -
Plans for Future Work

be Make Trips to Neighboring
Cities Soon

Although the Dramatic Club has no defi- |
nite plans in mind yet, several things are be-
ing thought about. Plans for a program to
be given here later, the returns of which are
to be split with the “Y,” are being worked
out. ;

The club intends to take a trip later, and
to give programs in several nearby cities. A

- performance will in all probability be given
in Gastonia first, and if the trip works out
well, Lynchburg and several other cities will
be visited.

In the past the Dramatic Club has not
functioned very well, or rather it has not
functioned very extensively, giving programs |
only here on the campus. If present plans
are worked, out, however, the club will

broaden its field of work and will make sev- |

eral trips to various parts of the state and
to neighboring states. This will fill a great |
vacancy on the Davidson campus. The need
for an organization of this: kind has been
felt and has been spoken of by various per-
sons on the campus.

If the plans which are being put into effect
this year work out well, the club will be able
to expand still more next year, and in a few
years the Dramatic Club will take its place
as one the leading organizations on the |
campus.
students, and there will be little trouble in
getting a lively interest worked up.

Scopes to Appeal for Rehearing

Thomas H. Malone and Henry F. Colton,
attorneys of John T. Scopes, who was con-
victed of teaching evolution, have announced
that they are going to file a motion for re-
hearing at once and that another movement
was under way to repeal the famous statute.
This petition will point out that the court
handed out three opinions, each being contra-
dictory in their interpretation of the law, and
that due to this other instructors might be
drawn into court and given unnecessary no-
toriety.
