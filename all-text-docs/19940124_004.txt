Winter Wonderland

Snow and ice
wreck travel plans
before and after
the break.

By Ashlyn Dannelly
Hazardous travel conditions
threw a wrench in the plans of

many students both before and af- —

ter Christmas. On Wednesday,
December 22, Residence Life
posted flyers warning students of
impending icy weather. The fly-
ers, along with messages distrib-
uted through the voice mail sys-
tem, urged remaining students to
plan their driving routes carefully,
and to leave as soon as possible in
order to avoid accidents.

Jay Jennings, a junior from
Philadelphia, saw those warnings,
but could not leave on Wednesday
as he had a fourth exam to take on
Thursday, December 23. He left
immediately after his exam to avoid
travelling on Christmas Eve, but
had an accident in northern Vir-
ginia, five hours into his planned
nine hour drive.

Jennings says, “there might
have been ice on the road, but I
think I just fell asleep.” Although
his car was damaged beyond re-
pair, Jennings was fortunately not
injured. As a result of his wreck,
Jennings says “I really think they
should change the academicsched-
ule to avoid this type of thing.”

When returning to Davidson
after the Christmas holiday, nu-
merous students encountered icy

weather again, causing several
wrecks and stranding many people
at home. Junior Kathy Oakes ar-
rived in time for Wednesday
classes, but had to fly from
Charlottesville, Virginia, instead
of driving as she had planned.
She says, “I was lucky we had
one four-wheel-drive vehicle so I

could get to the airport and get here
by Wednesday. My car is still
stuck in my driveway.”

The bitter cold weather con-
tinues and ice still covers several
areas of the road and sidewalks on
campus. Fortunately, warmer
weather, possibly in the 50s, has
been predicted for this week.

Aid available to
Midwest students

WASHINGTON (CPS)--An
additional $20.9 million in aid has
been made available to 32,000 col-
lege students whose families suf-
fered financial hardship as a result
of last year’s flooding in the Mid-
west, Education Secretary Dick
Riley announced.

The funding supplements $30
million in emergency federal Pell
Grants that the department made
available to needy students in Au-
gust, 1993. Some of the money
may beused to let college students
assist in recovery and cleanup.
The $20.9 million will be
awarded through campus-based
programs, which include federal
work-study of $8.3 million,
Perkins Loans of $4.6 million, and
federal Supplemental Education
Opportunity Grants of $8 million.

Students interested in apply-
ing for funds should contact cam-

lives are better off today than they
were 30 years ago.

Taylor continued speaking
about the present situation for Af-
rican-Americans. He namesblack-
on-black crime as the most signifi-
cant threat to blacks today.

Ofthe 11,175 African-Ameri-
cans killed in the United States last
year, 94 percent were killed by
fellow African-Americans. Tay-
lor feels that there are too many
guns in the United States, and that
the number of murders could be
reduced if the number of guns were
reduced.

The speaker did not offer an-
swers to the problems in America
today. He believes in the power of
God and still hopes for equality
despite the racism he sometimes
faces.

Returning from abroad
brings culture shock

By Sally Stone

For most Davidson students,
returning from the one month
Christmas hiatus is a shock to their
systems. The students on leave or
abroad last semester returned to
Davidson last week following a
seven month separation. Many
rienced culture shock.
After spending last semester
in Oxford, England, junior Scott
Hile describes his homecoming as
an adjustment. Reintegrating him-
self to the academic schedule and
social system “takes a while to get
accustomed to,” Hile comments.

Davidson remains much the
same, however, Hile notes. He
remarked that while he was ex-
pecting Davidson to exhibit some
differences, it has not changed that
much.

Hile had expected to witness ,

changes in social regulations he
heard about, yet has not yet noticed
the difference. The many new
faces around campus, especially
the freshmen, were a new experi-
ence, Hile said.

T.K. Tibby, a junior, went on
the Davidson in Beaufort program
in the fall and comments on the
unfamiliar faces she has seen. She
“feels like a freshman again” as.
she meets these strangers.

Tibby’s renewed energy and
excitemen{upon returning to cam-
pus also remind her of freshman
year. She states that she feels
“charged” after spending a semes-
ter away from Davidson. She is
ready to tackle the courses which
were not available to her last se-
mester, such as Spanish.

Like Hile, Tibby expects to
find changes within the college
system, although she has yet to feel
the impact. For example, as a
Bonner scholar, she understands
that she will finds changes within
the program and must adjust.

For the most part, Davidson
life is found just as it was left by
these students in May. For return-
ing students, Davidson proves that
while subtle changes occur, its
foundation remains firmly rooted
in place.

Leaders trek to Rio Grande

was going to become ill. Accord-
ing to Ed Daugherty, co-director
of Davidson Outdoors, it was “good
foresight on the part of the trip

spring of over 100 degrees, the

They also worked hard to pre-
serve nature. After camping out
beside the river each night, the
group carefully packed up every-
thing. “We worked hard to make it
as untouched by us as possible,”
says sophomore Miles Mowry.

Sophomore Claudia Lombard

ing I’ve ever seen in my life. The
