Both men are already living in Davidson.

Terry said that Hunt in handling the infirmary
sick call during the week, between 3 and 5 p.m.
each day, and that Williams is relieving him at
least some of the time on weekends.

The Saturday sick call will be from 1 to 2 p.m.
and the Sunday will run from 7 to 8 p.m. These
times were carefully chosen on the basis of a
questionaire which was distributed just before the
end of the spring term.

Hunt said he was very pleased with the
questionaire response—he said over a hundred
students took the time to fill them out—and_

~~ hopes to take some of the suggestions to heart.

Hunt said that many women complained of a

Williams feel comfortable in this area, he said,
because of their experience with internal medicine
and will be able to help.

“One thing I really want to request from the
students is open communication. I'd be happy to
talk to any group,”’ said Hunt.

WDAV currently takes up a-
bout 83 percent of air time. This
past summer the WDAV Board
of Directors, a student/facul-
ty/administration group
charged with establishing poli-
cy for the station, agreed to
increase classical programming
to 50 percent of air time by this
November 15.

Thompson and his staff also
questioned a Department of
Communications document re-
leased this week which says
that in Spring 1977 the Board of
Directors agreed that WDAV
shall broadcast “‘a variety of

Changes proposed

CRC sets meeting

By SHERI GRAVETT
Asst. Editorial Editor
Among his recommendations
for changes in the Davidson
~ constitution; College President
Samuel R. Spencer, Jr. has
proposed that both the Council
of Campus and Religious Life
(CCRL) and the Council for
Finance, Personnel, and Deve-

lopment (CFPD) be divided:

into separate councils..
_ A Constitutional Review
Committee (CRM} composed of
Trustees Price Gywn, Walter
Lingle, and J. Dickson Phillips,
SGA President Bruce Brown,
Vice President Pro-Tempore of
the Faculty John Kelton, and
Vice President for Academic
Affairs Price Zimmermann will
“mset September 27 to discuss
Spencer’s proposals plus any
-..gubmitted by the faculty, staff,

or student body.

All proposals must be turned -
. in the President's office by Sep-

According to Spencer the
—spread of functions covered. by.

these councils is too great.
Therefore he has suggested that
the CCRL be split into the
Advisory council on Religious

Policy and the Advisory Coun-.-

cil on Campus Life while the
CFPD be divided into the
Advisory Council for Finance
and Personnel and the Advisory

would parallel those of the
Trustee’s thus providing more

cooperation and opportunity for.

joint service and involvement
by students and faculty.

After the meeting on Septem-
ber 27, the CRM. will decide
which suggestions should be
put in the form of recommended
amendments and put in motion
the suggested revisions.

These amendments will be
taken before the Board of
Trustees. After discussion and
comments solicited from the
faculty, staff, and student bo-
dy, a two-thirds vote of the
Board. is required to adopt an
amendment.

with a primary emphasis on
classical music.”

-manager Sid Barret said the

Board had never adopted such a
policy in the spring.
statement we (the Board) .a-
dopted never said anything
about a primarily classical em:
phasis,’’ stated Thompson.
Both hinted that the “primarily
classical” clause had been in-
serted during the summer with-
out Board approval. .

Roberts, author of the docu-
ment containing the disputed
policy statement, later acknow-
ledged her uncertainty that the
“primarily classical” clauge had
been approved by the Board.
When she was gathering infor-
mation on the radio station this
summer, “Don Lovell handed
me agsheet of papers that were a
revised policy and guidelines
sheet. It was my impression
that that had -been passed
through the Board.” She said
that she did not confirm that
impression and is now uncertain
of its accuracy.

The students also balked at a
statement in the Department of
Communications document
which holds that FCC approval
of the station’s recent switch to
18,500 watts was based on the
criteria that WDAV would be a
primarily classical music sta-
tion. WDAV Educational Di-
rector Mary Frances Leopold
reported that they had called
FCC officials and received assu-
rances that the Commission is
not concerned with a station's
particular type of program-
ming.

After the meeting, Roberts

said that she had received her .

information about the FCC
grant from News Director Buck
Lawrimore and wanted to check
further into the question of FCC
criteria.

After addressing these speci-
fic points, Thompson com-
plained of the administration's
negiect of student concerns in
radio station policymaking.
“We must have fair treatment

in theoperation of this station.
ors

“The.

Communication with regard to
honesty and straightforward-
ness has been a miserable
failure. It is important that

everyone be fully informed of ©

what's happening,” he said.

Board Member and staffer
Janet Coleman echoed Thomp-
son’s concerns that administra-
tive decisions about the radio
station are being made without
student input. “Maybe there is
an honest communications gap,
but I think we have tried to
close that gap. Someone is
certainly resisting closing this
gap. We are not part of deci-
sions, we are told what deci-
sions have been made. Since my
freshman year, we have worked
out compromises with Dr.
Parks, Buck Lawrimore, and
Mrs. Roberts (all Board mem-
bers) on many occasions, but
Dr. Spencer has constantly said
; no way,” Coleman said.

Director .of the Library Le-
land Park, who also attended
the meeting, said ‘I don’t really
believe anyone is out to deceive
or be dishonest with you. I
don’t want to leave the picture
that someone is out to screw
you. I would be very surprised
if you were required to go over
50 percent (classicgl).”’

At the conclusion of the
meeting Thompson asked Ro-
berts to obtain an official state-

AQ

°

ment from the administration
for today’s previously sche-
duled WDAV Board of Direc-
tors meeting to clarify the
amount of classical program-
ming that WDAV must sche-
dule by November 15. “Please
prepare us a statement saying
that until we have discussed the
matter with the Trustees, no
more that 50 percent of the
programming will be classical,”
Thompson said sternly.

tha Pompson also asked that

the administration’s statement

explain "Gaisicel ection of 80
percent programming
and clarify how the ‘primary
emphasis on classical music’
plirase came to be inserted in
the WDAV Statement of Pur-
pose and Policy.

‘Roberts said that she ‘will
ask Dr. Spencer to advise me
how he wants to respond.”

Thompson and other staff.
members plan to approach the
Trustees in their Homecoming
meeting regarding their vote
last spring to fund a primarily
classical station. He points out
“To serve our audience means
serving all rather than only
those who contributed the mo-
ney. We don’t want a predomi-
nance of any musical form. We
must meet the true, diverse
needs ofthe “community. ”
