A WEEK BEFORE the Catawba game, Coach Dole
posted a sign in the dressing room under the Richardson
|Field Grandstand. The sign read, BEAT CATAWBA,
| MOVE THE BALL. The day after the game, a couple of
! alterations had been penciled in. The sign now reads,
“we BEAT CATAWBA, we MOVEd THE BALL.”

THE CHEERLEADERS are due some congratulation
|for the response they got from the. Davidson section
iduring the Catawba thrashing. Several of the players
‘have commented about the stronger traces of school
spirit
} The cheering squad has a long way to go, however.
|Several years ago, when Wildcat fortunes were low but
| spirit: was high, the cheerleaders chugged out onto the
field atop a firetruck or on other occasions, an ancient
| jalopy.
Props and such help, but when you get right down
to it, the only thing that ean make a crisp fall afternoon
and a football game sound as it should is the roar of a
‘few hundred male voices raised in unison. The cheer-
leaders can’t do it all—we have to help out.

And a good time to start would be tomorrow after-
noon.

STATISTICS MAKE All-Conference baliplayers., If
Charlie Benson makes the grade this year, it will ‘be
largely because the members of the Southern Confer-
lence Sports Writers Association got together and figured
;out who was leading what department.

‘forward passing. Dick Longfellow, West Virginia, was
}second in total offense and first in passing. Sam Horner,
| the third man was first in rushing and punting. Ray Si-
/minski, All-S.C. end from Furman was first in pass catch-
ing while Carroll Dale, V.P.1., at the other terminal was
third.
| If individual statistics could be kept’ on linemen,
the results would be the same.
| Benson is due to move up in the statistic popularity
poll if he has a good year. He is hampered by the fact
that Davidson only plays nine games as opposed to the
10 contest slate played by most of the schools in the
conference. Benson, in spite of this handicap, was third
in both total offense and forward passing last fall.
His main rivals for the honor post this season are
|Furman’s Billy Baker, G.W.’s Ed Hino, Frank Gagliano
| of Richmond and Jerry Nettles of The Citadel.
The rugged ’Cat field general has already been get-
ting the press notices. The most effusive was from the
Charlotte Observer, which hailed him as a “passing
legend in the Carolinas.”

| pose about two-thirds of the
'squad. Forty percent of the
{team will never have play-
‘ed a game of soccer when
jwe play Carolina next Fri-
‘day.”’

After presenting this disturb-
ing picture, soccer coach Paul
Marrotte went on to predict
a break-even season for his
green team. But will the Wild-
cat head-and-toe men be as
good as last year’s team which
was only one win over the .500
mark?

“Frankly, no,” Marrotte
said. “Dr. McCutchan and |!
figure that in the nine play-
ers who graduated last year,
we lost 25 years total ex-

perience.
“We can’t measure up to the
A.C.C. teams this year. Last

year we played them to over-
time. Carolina and State are in
a class with the strong eastern
teams like Maryland.” They al-
ways have good material, they
are well coached and they go
in for soccer in a big way.”

Marrotte’s big problem. The
fact that the sophomores were
unable to schedule a match ag
freshmen last year has hurt.
Many of them have never play-
ed in a regulation match.

The foreign students, who
proved themselves invaluable
in 1958, have departed for
their homelands and their ‘59

have the same soccer know.

The ‘Cats open up with
U.N.C. a week- from today at
Chapel Hill and play their first
home game on Oct. 7, with Bel-
mont Abbey. Tom Johnson, who
was severely kicked in the
shin, is at present, the only
player not at full strength, His
loss will be costly against the
Tar Heels. a
