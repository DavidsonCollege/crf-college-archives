The main thing that we are after

for physiéal fitness, of course. In
addition, you take a new simplified
test to determine your ability to grasp
the training. A college man should
pass it easily.

duty will go into training as rapidly
as facilities permit. Aspan Aviation

care, uniforms, equipment.

cer’s commission as a bombardier,
