Trading Places: oh, my, we liked it

By CHARLES HOUTCH
andJOHN HUCKINSON

Trading Placesisa great movie.
Go see it. Five or six times.

Say, that was kind of short,
wasn’t it? Aren’t reviews sup-
posed to be longer? So what else
can be said about it? Well, it’s
going to be playing Friday at 7:30
& 9:45 in the 900 Room, and has
Eddie Murphy, Dan Aykroyd, and
Jamie Lee Curtis in it. And her
hooters, but we’re fot allowed to
talk about those.

There. Rats, it’s still too short.
' Well, all right. Trading Places
is a fine film that addresses.one of
the timeless questions of human
éxistence, whether it’s heredity or
environment that determines
human behavior. Sortof. Okay,so
it addresses it in a very superficial
way, but it doesn’t matter since
the movie doesn’t really try to
make a statement about anything.

What Trading Places does do is
to set Murphy and Aykroyd up as
_ guinea pigs in an experiment that

results in a very funny movie.
Their characters represent oppo-
site extremes of the social scale:
Murphy is Billy Ray Valentine, a
young streetwise black man from
the ghetto, whose history includes
a broken home and juvenile of-
fenses. Akroyd is Louis
Winthorp, a snobby Exeter and
Harvard graduate who is manag
ing director of Duke and Duke, a
Philadelphia brokerage house.
Enter the diabolical Duke

brothers, played by veteran actors -

Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche,
aging heads of Duke and Duke and
aspiring behavioral scientists. In
order to settle their personal ar-
guement over the nature vs. nur-
ture controversy, they make a bet

over our heros’ success or failure «

if their social positions are re-
versed. The amount at stake? One
dollar. For that measly sum they
proceed to wreck Winthorp’s life
while dragging Valentine from
the ghetto to the corporate
boardroom.

re-

_ Theensuing confusionand final
revenge on the evil Dukes pro-
vides, at the very least, good enter-
tainment for two hours.

How’s that? More? How much
more? O.K., fine.

But phat else is there?
...Oh yeah, it was directed
by John Landis, of Animal House
and /Twilight Zone fame. How-
, having learned his lesson,
is uses no helicopters in this
film,p successfully avoiding the
decapitation of any of his stars.
Despite the lack ‘of accidents,
Landis comes up with a well-
constructed film, using the two
former Saturday Night Live stars
to, if not their full potential, then
to adegree sufficienttomakeafun
movie and buttloads of money. °
The characters, if stereotypical in
some ways, play off of one an-

other in a very entertaining fash- ,

ion.

In short, Trading Places is a-
great movie. Go see it. And if you
don’t like it, you can pack sand.

Student-faculty relations studied

By Russell Booker
Fifteen Years Ago -- November
10, 1972 (LXII, 8)

The. problems of faculty-stu-
dent relations are being examined
at Davidson, where much is made
of the relationship between fac-
ulty and students. Problems cited
are a miniscule amount of social
contact between professirs and
students, inadequate advising of

- students regarding graduate
school, and an unwillingness

among many students to approach :

their professors, even for aca-
demic help, for fear of being seen
by their peers as “‘brown-nosers.”

Professors claim that students
do not take the initiative. Some
professors have said that the fac-
ulty open house died due mainly
to student indifference. Dean of
Students Will H. Terry adds that,
when itcomes torelations with the

_ faculty, students often “have been

careless to the point of being
rude.” Many students agree that
students should take more initia-
tivein thearea of faculty relations.
One junior observed that every
time he has seen a student take the

initiative, he has seen him develop
a good relationship with that fac-
ulty member.

The SGA is releasing a poll.

faculty-student relations -- advi-
sor/advisee relationship. Fresh-

‘man and graduate school advising

are the two major topics of the
survey, with which both students
as and faculty will present their
opinions on the quality of the
counsel given to students at the
college.
