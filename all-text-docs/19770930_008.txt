Thoughts on the Second Sunday

| have come to this place to stay

| have come to this place to pray

Head bowed or uplifted

To make the cross more than a geometric figure
The intersection of two terribly straight lines
Hung with acorpse ia ate
Hands folded or wrung with desperation

To make words more than conversation

The comic strip balloons must go.

+

| have come to look out a different window

Elizabeth Brailsford

Through the turning blades of the necessary fan

To the windows across the way

We seekers stare across space

But their faces are nameless, needless,
Unnecessary trivia

| have lost the fight with gravity
Although | live on the second floor.
