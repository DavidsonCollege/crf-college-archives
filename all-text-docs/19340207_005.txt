oa | Around the Wildcat’s Lair pes

Those fighting Davidson Wildcats
sort of took it on the chin in their
games played last week. First of all,
the varsity basketball team invaded
thtee Virginia colleges and bit the dust

in two of the three encounters. To
start things off, the ’Cats, led by the
lanky Jim Morgan, sank Monk Young-
er’s V. P. I. Gobblers to the tune of
32 to 28. Then came the setbacks
when the University of Virginia and
William and Mary quints gave the
Wildcats severe trouncings.

The two losses, however, are no re-
flection on the Davidson team because
those Virginians are really putting out
some splendid teams this year.

Although the scores on paper d& not
indicate the ability of the Wildcats,
those boys have a team not to be
sneered at. They are working hard
to produce a winning combination, but
old man hard luck seems to stick with
them.

The students who saw Davidson,
rated as underdogs, almost lick Duke
and State only to lose out in the last
few minutes of play, realize that those
Wildcats don’t have such a bad team
after all. All the teams’ in the Big
Five have excellent material this year
and it’s just too bad that Davidson has
to land in the cellar.

When Carolina’s White Phantoms
upset the Duke Blue Devils last week,
the sports fans were taken by surprise.
The Tar Heels’ victory gave their
brother team at State the Big Five
leadership. The Wolfpack has won
four and lost one, while both the Car-
olina and Duke fives have won three
and lost:one. Wake Forest has won
one and dropped four, and Davidson
has won exactly none and lost four.

The freshman basketeers will be
given a severe test when they meet
strong teams representing the two out-
standing prep schools in the South,
Darlington and McCallie, on Friday
and Saturday. Ramsay Potts, Darling-
ton’s ace forward who plays basket-
ball as superbly as he swings a racquet
to tennis championships, will be the
spotlight in the Romans’ attack. It
is remembered that it was this same
youth who ran circles around the
freshman team of last year. We will
be with you at these contests to see
the Centennials exhibit their power.

And speaking of Bruce Peabody’s
young aggregation, it looks like~ the
prospects for a varsity cage téam next
year are bright. Charlotte’s gift of
Peabody and Quick should prove an
asset to next year’s varsity-which will
have-three regulars back, Harris, Ross,
and Morgan. Porter, Knorr, and
Cathey should all see service next year,

While the varsity basketball team
goes on the state trip, meeting State,
Wake Forest, Duke, and Carolina, re-
spectively, the inter-fraternity basket-
ball tournament, spring football prac-
tice, tennis, wrestling, and boxing oc-
cupy the students’ interest here in our
own back yard.

The fraternity cage meet is in the

midst of its fury, with the Phi Delts
and K. A.’s leading the field so far by
reaching the semi-finals. To pick the
winner of the tourney would be a task,
and some hot battles will be played
before the champion is determined.
* Random Shots: Spring football prac-
tice continues. . . . Two gridsters keep
in trim by taking open-air calisthenics
without football togs (or anything
else!) . . . The varsity tennis team
should go places this year. It has the
prospects of being the best net team to
represent Davidson in a number of
years .. . Wade Ison’s contest of Da-
vidson All-Time football team is a
wonderful affair. It has attracted in-
terest of Davidson followers all over
the country... . It has been said of
the Wildcats that they always win
their games. Well, moral victories
anyway. ... The other members of
the Big Five are fortunate in securing
such remarkable new coaches, but Da-
vidson is doubly proud of its coaching
set-up of Newton and McEver. . ...
Earle Frazier and Ras Evans should
chalk up some track records this year
in their capacities.

GRAPPLERS LOSE
TO VIRGINIA TECH
IN UNEVEN MEET

Captain Fort and Jim Harris Only
Men to Score for ’Cat
Team

SCORE IS 2214 TO 91,

Duke and Carolina Are Next on
Schedule for Matmen

The Davidson College grapplers end-
ed a somewhat disappointing invasion
of Virginia last Saturday, when they
were turned back 22% to 9% by a
strong Virginia Tech wrestling team.

In. the match, which was held at
Blacksburg, the Gobblers took five of
the eight bouts and fought to a draw
in the 165-pound class. Three Tech-
men and one Davidsonian scored falls
in the exciting meet. Captain Fort in
the 165-pound class was the only ’Cat
wrestler to score a fall over his op-
ponent, although Jim Harris of Da-
vidson gained a time decision over Carl
Lungrin of V. P. I.

Russel Minter, Tech star, pinned
John Thompson in the 126-pound bout
and another Techman, Clete Broyles,
threw John Taylor in the 145-pound
event. Captain Nelson Waldrop, Tech
175-pounder and Southern Conference
champion in his weight, clinched the
meet for his team by pinning LeRoy
Blackwelder in short order.

In the coming contests with Duke,
Carolina, and State, the 'Cats intend
to avenge these defeats and carry on
a successful campaign in North Caro-
lina, at Teast.

In the Duke meet, which will be held
Saturday at Durham, Coach Unger
hopes to have the services of Potter
and Sprunt, who previously have been
unable to report for practice. With
these additions to, the team, the ’Cats
should put up a real fight.

The match with Carolina, which is
scheduled for the 16th; and=the match
with Duke on the 10th, will decide
whether Davidson is oiit of the state
contest or not. If the ’Cats should win,
they will meet State at Charlotte in
the finals; otherwise it will be held
here,

Pikas and anna ccivs to Play
Second Round Matches

The Kappa Alphas and Phi Delta
Thetas entered the semi-finals of the
inter-fraternity basketball tournament
by virtue of a win over the Phi Gam-
ma Deltas and Beta Theta Phis, re-
spectively.

Led by Captain E. IF. McPhail, the
kK. A.’s won their second round match
29-10, although being given much
stronger competition than the score in-
dicates. The superb passing attack
and the accurate goal tossing proved
too much of a handicap for the Phi
Gams,

The Beta Theta Phis and Phi Delta
Thetas met in the second round due to
a bye received in the first round by
both teams.

The Phi Delts oiled their attack and
shifting into high ran over the Betas,
29-6. Much spirit was shown by both
teams throughout the contest, but the
Phi Delts’ combination proved too
strong for Captain Richardson’s team.

The .Kappa Sigmas received the
right to play the Sigma Alpha Ep-
silons in the second round by virtue of
a first round forfeit from the Theta
Upsilon Omegas.

Led by Captain Kirkland, the Phi
Kappa Alphas defeated the Phi Kappa
Phis, 16-6, to enter the second round
and become the opponents of the Sig-
ma Phi Epsilons, who had gained the
second round due to a bye.

Teams still in the tournament will
play their matches off during this
week,

As the weather becomes more balmy
and clement, the lads from the Wild-

into their annual spring program, and
the plans of the Davidson coaches are
beginning to unfold in their entirety.

Since the majority of the candidates
for berths on the 1934 football squad
have been working out in the gym for
several weeks previous to the actual
start of practice, the task of the
coaches has been considerably light-
ened, and they have been able to start
almost immediately into
work.

After a period of lectures on funda-
mentals last week, when the weather
Was too cold to permit outside prac-

when two teams chosen by the coaches
fought it out for a good afternoon's
training.

On Monday and Tuesday they con-
tinued to work on fundamentals, as
the coaches intend to do until they be-
lieve they have a good enough basis
to proceed to a further degree. The
mentors intend to select the
two teams for practice until some time
later on this week.

During the second half the two teams
played on practically even terms, but
the Cadets were unable to overcome
