In Defense Of Liberty

The question of compulsory ROTC
is up for consideration again.

The faculty had it under study at
its meeting this afternoon, and the
trustees will probably get it again
when they meet here next weekend.

We only hope that both groups will

see fit to go along with what the Blue
Sky Committee has asked, and drop
required ROTC from the new curricu-
lum.
Some of those who want the change
base their conviction on a belief that
war is immoral and that a compulsory
program only lends support to the
militarism that is already too much a
part of our society.

A larger number rightfully argue
that required ROTC restricts freedom
in course selection, especially now
that a student is limited to eight
courses per year anyway.

Neither argument. however. is so
compelling as that offered by the Blue
Sky Committee. The argument, quite
simply, is that ROTC has no place in a
liberal arts curriculum.

Though a useful subject, military
science does not contribute to the
liberalization of the mind. It does not
produce more humane attitudes in

young men. It does not broaden their
perspective. nor does it prompt them
to seek knowledge purely for the sake
of learhing.

The motto of this institution was
purportedlv written by a French field
marshal: “Let learning be cherished
where liberty has arisen.”

That liberty must continue to be
protected is an unfortunate fact of
life in our world and will be as long
as there are those who continue to
‘violate it. But to confuse our duty of
protecting liberty with our charge to
continue to cherish learning is a mis-
take which need not be made.

ROTC has been, and can continue
to be, a valuable asset to this institu-
tion. Its “good deals’ cannot be de-
nied. - ,
But neither can it be denied that its
subject matter is outside the liberal
arts spectrum. If we truly cherish
learning, we cannot tolerate the com-
pulsory status: of the program or the
academic credit which goes with it.

The defense of liberty will not suf-
fer if ROTC is placed on a voluntary
basis; the commitment of this institu-
tion to providing a liberal education
will certainly be strengthened.

The Faculty’s New Role

A couple of remarks made by fac-
ulty members last week in a meeting
called to deal with the town’s civil
rights progress, or lack of it, indicate
that at least some professors are tak-
ing a somewhat less than openminded
attitude about the barber shop boy-
cott and other student efforts to erase
the town’s double standard.

The purpose of the meeting was to
consider a student proposed resolu-
tion to integrate all town facilities.
and before the faculty finally passed
a watered-down version of it, some of
its members made it pretty hot for the
student leaders invited to attend.

One professor, for instance, sarcas-
tically asked a senior if the boycott
would be the last cause he would
“champion” as a student here.

Another pointed out that most stu-
dents are here for only four years,
while “the rest of us have to live
here.”

Neither point was particularly well

put by the faculty members.

If there is anything Davidson needs,
it is more champions of worthy causes.
There are already too many problems
here and too few leaders to solve them.

Nor is a professor’s extended resi-
dence here any excuse for backing
away from the problems. Instead, he
Should be doubly concerned about
them, and more prone to action.

One of the hardest lessons people

have to learn is that just because
something has been done a certain
way before, it doesn’t have to remain
that way.
_ The faculty can be a key influence
in this regard. Our professors are our
most important sources of academic
knowledge, and there is no reason for
this enlightenment to be limited to the
classroom. °

There are lessons to be learned out-
side the ivory tower, too, lessons
which the faculty should be, but is
not, teaching us.

Is There No Justice?

Before the Mecklenburg County po-
lice make another arrest in Davidson,
they should buy a good dictionary and
check the meaning of a few terms—
like justice and order, for instance.

When Lew Homer was told he got a
“continuation of his trial” yesterday.
it sounded like a good thing. Fat
chance! It simply means his trial has
been postponed until the middle of
exams and an additional charge of as-
sdulting an officer has been added to
the other charge of disturbing the
peace.

Everyone knows that the Davidson
students who picketed Johnson's Bar-
ber Shop and the policemen who ar-
rested Homer disagree about. racial
integration of the barber shop. But
this discrepancy of beliefs is no reason
to make a scapegoat out of a Davidson
student—to make him suffer mentally,

academically and monetarily and to
leave a permanent scar upon him and
his family.

The students who picketed the bar-
ber shop were not breaking the law.
And from all the sources we've con-
sulted, neither was Lew Homer. If the
police want to claim that he was creat-
ing an inflamatory situation, they can
only blame themselves, for they added
the flames.

The time for redefinition of terms
has arrived. If the Mecklenburg police
are going to enforce the law, they must
first understand what it is.

If Homer is convicted, it will be a
complete miscarriage of justice. And
they can reasonably assume that the
Davidson students will again assert
their constitutional rights, this time
perhaps more vigorously and in great-
er number.

The Slumbering Leader

A Southern Presbyterian minister
visiting the campus the other day hit
on one of the things that is ailing Da-
vidson better than anyone we've heard
recently.

He was a ‘guest of a contemporary
religion class, and some of the stu-
dents, taking note of the Southern
Presbyterians’ conservative racial
policy, were giving him a pretty hard
time of it.

What, they demanded to know, is
the church doing about getting more
Negro members?

The minister could only shrug and
point to some not-so-very-forceful reso-
lutions, offering the guardedly opti-
mistic opinion that the day for com-
plete integration is caming.

Maybe, he said, it will come about
the time Davidson is integrated.

The barb struck home, for the em-
barrassed questioners hastily turned
to other matters. ; ;

The question the minister was rais-
ing, by implication, was this: what is
Davidson, the South's leading Presby-
terian college, doing for the Negro?

The answer in his mind, and every-
body else’s too, was abundantly clear:
practically nothing. -_

]t shouldn’t take a minister to tell

us what ails us, to point out that we
are not living up to our obligations, to
indicate we are letting opportunities
slip by.

Because it is obvious that we are.

Other schools are waking up to
reality. A survey of 12 leading Ameri-
can colleges and universities in this
week’s ‘Newsweek’ indicates that all
but one have this spring increased the
number of their Negro acceptances,
some significantly.

For instance, Amherst, our look-
alike up North, has accepted 28
Negroes for a freshman class of 300.
Pomono, another school with a com-
parable size, accepted 15. And Prince-
ton, the so-called Davidson of the
North,.took 77 Negroes for 810 places
—a whopping jump over last year’s
acceptance of 23.

Davidson, however, slumbers on,
with no signs of awakening. We are

not receiving any more Negro appli-

cations, and therefore we are not ac-
cepting any more. And worst of all,
we are not doing anything about it.

When Rip Van Winkle finally woke
up, he eventually eased his way back
into society. Davidson may not be so
lucky.

LETTERS

Senior Binds Reid
To ‘Whipping Post’

To The Editor:

T think the title of Bob
Reid's column. ‘Whipping
Post.’ is most appropriate,
because years ago it was at
the’ whipping post that in-
dividuals were humiliated in
public. Such punishment has
tong since been stopped on
the grounds that it is “cruel
and unusual.”’

Last week's column,. “Will
Chambers Become Lingle
Manor?”, did, I feel, border
on the cruel and unusual. In
articles which deal with opin-
ion based on facts, such as
last week's column was sup-
posedly based upon, it is im-
perative that the writer be
very certain that his facts
are correct. Freedom of opin-
ion. is necessary, but when
that opinion is based on poor-.
ly researched information.
great injustice and hurt can
be the result.

In his column Mr. Reid
asked the question, ‘Will Mr.
Lingle follow the steps of his
father who, while chairman
of the board in 1929. appoint-
ed himself president to suc-
ceed another President Mar-
tin?’’ Of the many things in
the article with which I dis-
agreed. this sentence con-
tained perhaps the most
grossly irresponsible misrep-
resentation of the facts.

Nothing could be more in-
correct than to say that Wal-
ter Lingle Sr: appointed him-
self president. In his book,
“Memories of Davidson.”’ Mr.
Lingle describes his selection
as president as ‘unexpected
and a bit unusual.”

When President William
Joseph Martin stepped down
in 1929. the Board of Trus-
tees appointed its chairman.
Walter Lingle, to chair a com-
mittee to nominate a new
president. Forty-six names
were submitted, of which Mr.
Lingle’s was one.

Because of his advanced
age (61), Chairman Lingle
would not allow his name on
the list. At the nominating
meeting in April, 1929, Mr.
Lingle was asked by his own
committee to accept the nom-
ination for the presidency, but
he refused on the grounds of
age and other reasons.

In spite of his refusal and
his insistence that he was
“greatly embarrased,"’ the
nominating committee asked
him to resign as chairman
and to reconsider for a week.
The following week he again
refused and it was sometime
later when he reluctantly ac-
cepted the nomination.

Although most of this in-

formation came from Mr.
Lingle‘s book. other reliable
sources have confirmed these
facts and the sequence of
events.

In view of these facts, the
great injustice done to the
former president is painfully
obvious. Almost equally bad
is the implication in the same
sentence that Walter Lingle
Jr., the present board chair-
man, might use his position
on the board and nominating
committee to get himself ap-
pointed president.

Not only does Mr. Reid
seem to be bringing to ques-
tion a man's motivation, but
also his character. And based
on what? In view of Mr.
Lingle’s present position as
executive vice-president of
Proctor and Gamble, one of
the nation’s largest corpora-
tions, and the many days of
company and personal time
spent on Davidson’s prob-
lems, I hope Mr. Reid will
agree that there is far more
sacrifice than gain in his
present position with David-
son.

We can all disagree with
some the decisions or the
board ard of Mr. Lingle. but
to imply personal motivation
on his part is entirely out of
reason. Mr. Reid's ‘‘Whipping
Post"’ has indeed dealt cruel
and unusual punishment to a
family dedicated to Davisdon
for many decades.

In the same article Mr.
Reid stated that once the stu-
dent advisory committee had
submitted its list of names to
Mr. Lingle’s committee, they

. were never consulted
or even informed concerning

the progress of the selection
process."

‘Again. Associate Editor
Reid has missed the boat.
The student committee has
consulted with trustees con-
cerning those names submit-
ted by students and has been
asked about student opinion
in a number of ureas. Al-
though each member would
like to see more use made of
it in the future, to say that
the committee hasn’t been
used is entirely incorrect.

Although there are other
things in the “Whipping Post”
with which I could quibble,
I think that my point has
been made. The privilege of
journalistic commentary car-
ries with it the responsibility
to blend opinion and specula-
ttion with well researched
facts. I hope that in the fu-
ture Mr. Reld will assume
this responsibility.

To The Editor:

In writing this letter, I
should first like to make pub-
lic my congratulations to
Bobby Lane and the other
students .who have miracu-
Jously replaced the lull in
effective student discussion,
which has been an estab-
lished part of THE DAVID-
SONIAN during this year,
with the debate of the issue
of the student boycott.

town, as a_ sociological grouping.
Then the college within the town.
And academic sub-circles within the

college.

Then social circles. Neat group-
ings of people, with various name-
tags. And still smaller social circles
—a student's cirele of close friends,
a clique that he gathers around him.

Then the smallest circle, the “I,”

the egg.

Davidson stresses smallness. Here
the small circles, not the large, are

aX)

most important, sometimes to the exclusion of any
considerations other than self, social and academic
circles, and the circle that is a small Southern college.

Take the circles in the reverse order, the Davidson
order, from the smallest circle of concern to the largest

circle of concern.

We are all self-oriented, sometimes so self-cen-
tered that we ride rough-shod over the feelings and
rights of everyone around us.

We get bogged down in the morass of narrow
social circles. It’s the same people within the same
narrow social structure, the same friends, every day,

every week, every weekend.

Academically, the problem is not so much a nar-
rowness of subject matter, but a narrowness and same-
ness of format and concern. Far too many professors
are more concerned with dip, the threads within the
fabric, than they are with broad patterns the fabric

of learning itself.

Students reflect and perpetuate this attitude. The
question is: not “what am I learning or what have I
learned?” but “what grade did you get?”

Davidson College is a circle continually doubling
on itself, inbred and inbreeding. Perhaps the real pur-
pose of Davidson is to train men who will teach here,
who will serve on the boards of Trustees and Visitors,
who will go out and encourage able, white, Protestant
young men of the next generation to come here to
school. Davidson is an incestuous institution.

There are signs of some revitalization, a concern
for larger circles. For instance, the Blue Sky report
and curriculum. Sections of the CRAP report. The bar-
bershop boycott. The concern for a more diverse stu-

dent body.

Even with these manifestations of change, David-
son students are still too self-concerned. and the col-
lege has encased itself within confines that are too

narrow.

Davidson College and Davidson students and grad-
uates have been damned good at maintaining the status
quo, the perpetuation of the existing small circles of

limited concern.

We have something to expiate: a pettiness.

Guest: Activists Add Luster
To A College, Student Body

But it is indeed sad to
think that such students who
picket and take part in the
Peace Vigil must not only
fight the’ prejudices of a
Southern public but must also
withstand the attacks of those
who would claim that the so-
cial work of these students
is destroying the ‘Davidson
image.” .

To try to refute such an
argument hardly merits one's

5 Go On Warpath, Urge
Scholarship For Indians

To The Editor:

It appears to us that while
much of the Davidson Col-
lege campus is intent on
raising a scholarship fund,
our entire recruiting or
“make Davidson more cos-
mopolitan” policy should be
analyzed.

One outstanding shortcom-
ing which comes to mind is
Davidson's lack of enrolling
American Indians. This is
certainly not due to any pre-
judice within the Admissions
Office but more likely be-
cause these true Americans
simply have not been attract-

believe that not only should
consideration be given to

In doing this, we, at this
college, would at least feel
as though we had not com-

ants of the first Americans.

It is my belief that David-

makes Davidson great.

And the role of students
