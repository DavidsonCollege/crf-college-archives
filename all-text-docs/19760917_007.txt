Davidson lost friend
in “Cop” Ray Sherrill

By JOE CRAIG
Staff Writer

This summer Davidson College lost
one of its best friends: Mr. Ray
Sherrill. I got to know ‘‘Cop”’ Sherrill
when I was a freshman working
Thursday night at the information
desk at the old College Union. Like
clockwork he would come in, pick up a
Davidsonian, and read it from begin-
ning to end. He just wanted to read
about “his boys and girls’ to make
sure that everything was all right
with them. _

Mr. Sherrill seemed to sense when
students needed some touch with
reality, when students were lost in
space with the causes of World War I
or biological metabolisms.

He brought them back to earth
with talk of some sweet little girl from

Watts he’d escorted across campus or
pick-up trucks or shotguns or farming
or fishing.

Studying for that crucial review
was more often than not pushed aside
for an hour as you ‘‘shot the breeze’’
with Mr. Sherrill. All nighters will be
lonely around here without him.

The college saw him as a good public
relations man, and then made sure he
was around for ‘‘big weekends’’ when
alumnior parents were visiting on
campus. But his late employers will
never understand fully his relation-
ship with students. He was an

integral part of the student’s life.

He was the first person I hoped to
see when I returned to campus this
year. I was looking forward to seeing

his slow shuffling gait, his quasi
police cap cocked crazily on his head,
and his big grin.

I knew he would tell me what had
really been going on at Davidson this
summer.

To write about Ray Sherrill and his
association with the students at
Davidson is a terribly difficult task.
One has to write with feeling while at
the same time refrain from becoming
overly maudlin.

Mr. Sherrill never seemed to get
overly emotional or upset; his expres-
sions of affection ranged from ‘‘he’s a
good ol’ boy”’ to ‘‘she’s a sweet 1’il
gal...” so I’ll just come out and say it
simply and quietly without much
fuss: he was my best friend.

Students rush to get in drop-add line on first day "

of classes. .

the Pyrenees along the Mediter-
ranean coast where they
stopped in Montpellier to visit Dav-
idson students on their junior year
abroad.

Up the coast they drove to Monaco
(where John Evans hit the jackpot on
a slot machine in the casino) and then
swung through the southern tip of the
French Alps.

From there the group cut over to
Germany and completed the circle in
Paris, home again to the Hotel Star.

After two weeks on the road the
group spent a week’s resting in Paris,
working on an independent third
course in the meantime. After that
the class toured the chateaux of the

Loire Valley, heading from there to
Mont-St.-Michel and through the
northern section of France. ~

They hit Rhiems during their Joan
of Arc festival and sat at a sidewalk
cafe to watch the parade. Their last
week was spent in Paris. The group
had to take exams but that did not
keep them from getting sentimental
about leaving.

The last night the group had
together a banquet was held at our
favorite restaurant, ‘‘Le Commerce’’,
with the friendliest waiters in town.

The group had grown especially
close but it was the perfect atmos-
phere for their studies. On May 15,
the seminar ended and each person
either continued travelling or headed
home the same way they came.

Second, the fraternities want to build
social selectivity into the system to
make social life better.

To the first point. In making this
argument, the opponent of self-selec-
tion is in no way making a comparison
between alternatives. He is merely
attacking one system because of its
imperfection. This is somewhat akin
to saying that the human condition is
abhorent because of original sin. Even
if the self-selection system is lousy or
the human condition is putrid, the
alternatives may be a whole lot worse.
Self-selection may still be the best
option.

The second argument is a bit
stronger. First, however, the magni-
tude of this advantage might be
questioned. How much will social life
improve? Second, the disadvantage
of institutionally sanctioned social
ostracization must be weighed again-
st whatever advantages can be
claimed. I admit that prejudices
between individuals and groups seem
rather natural these days. They will
probably continue whether or not
there is self-selection.

But to institutionalize petty social
fights is to crush some individuals

beneath the wheels of social bigotry.
Allowing fraternity selectivity would
probably result in increased isolation
of groups on campus and would
certainly hurt the excluded person

who wants to join.

Perhaps my political axiom needs
modification. People, including Poli-
ticians, Are Dumb, but only some of
the time. Maybe the time put into this

column constitutes a portion of that
“some of the time.”’

If it does not, however, self-sel-
ection just might be worth preserving
and affirming.
