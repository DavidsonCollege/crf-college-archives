Reoriented Orientation ....

Casual chats with members of the
Class of 1968—“the best yet,” we are
told—reveals a warm reception for
the revamped orientation program.

Regarded by most institutions as a
necessary evil, orientation has been
maligned at Davidson for years.

Last year the traditional faculty
reception for freshmen—lingering on
from the days when the faculty num-
bered three and the student body in-
cluded 65—was successfully overhaul-
ed. Dividing the faculty by depart-
ments, the new system allows for more
than a handshake and a mouthful of
social chit-chat.

Further improvements were made
in the Orientation program this year:

The reorganized orientation pro-
gram, directed by Freshman Adviser
John Barrow, turns its attention to a
higher level than programs in the
past. No longer is there a day-long
parade of speakers to tell the matri-
culating students when the Chess
Club meets, how a live wildcat streng-
thens school spirit, and where the
plumbing facilities are located in the
Union. Gone are the hours of “This
is your YMCA” and “Let me tell you
about the Eumanean Literary Soci-
ety.”

Rather, the new approach goes
beyond the day-by-day organizational
details of the college. Davidson as
a whole is viewed. The college’s goals.
The relation with the church. The
meaning of a liberal arts education.
Explained Dean of Students Richard
C. Burts beforehand: “We are taking
Davidson’s statement of purpose,
which neatly divides into four areas,
and planning our orientation program
around it.”

The four areas spotlighted included
“Christian Commitment,” “College—
A Community of Learning,” “Educa-
tion in the Liberal Arts,” and “The
Personal Challenge of a Davidson Ed-
ucation.”

The dean of students continued his
explanation: “We'll have a guest
speaker to highlight each area for the
entire entering class and then the
class will break into groups of 15 stu-
dents, each under the guidance of a
faculty member and a student group
leader from one of the upper classes
for extended discussion of the sub-
ject.” Dean Burts emphasized that in
the discussion sessions “all aspects of
the college’s program” were to be
touched” and related to the inspira-
tional talks presented by the keynote
speakers.”

Conversations with freshmen reveal
the discussion group as the best-liked
feature of the new orientation pro-
gram. Reports one: “I have always
thought of discussion groups and
seminars as perhaps the core of a
college education. I was glad to find
out what one was really like before
classes started. In this way you learn
not only from your professors but
also your fellow students.” Such re-
ports were especially frequent from
the students who enrolled in the
seminar-prone Humanities program.

‘And another: “I benefitted more
from the discussion group than any-
thing else. Lecturés get mighty dry,
but we had a good leader. And that
made a difference.”

Some groups experienced difficul-
ties: but these appear to have arisen
out of the ineptness of some group
leaders in provoking discussion.
Nevertheless, the overall picture is
one of change in the right direction.

But despite the changes, the usual
complaints remain: “This may be a
lot more condensed for us than it was
your year, but it’s still a rat race.”
He paused and then added his spark
of an idea: “You know, it would be a
really good program if they kept the
same program but added another day.
That would give a little more time to
spread. out orientation.”

To The Pledge Trainers....

As a large majority of the Fresh-
man Class wandered into the out-
stretched arms of fraternity men on
Patterson Court this afternoon, the
freshmen also were placing them-
selves in the hands of 12 pledge train-
ers. And it is here that our interests
lie:

If for no reason other than the posi-
tion you hold, you will command the
respect and admiration of a sizeable

art of the Class of 1968. Your in-

uence can be either used to your
fraternity’s and the college’s advant-
age—or disadvantage.

Certainly you have an obligation to
your house to assist your pledges in
the next six months. But you also
have an obligation to the college to
encourage full participation in all as-
pects of Davidson life. There should

e not contradiction in these objec-
tives. And if there is, then somethin
must give—the fraternity or the col-
lege.

Freshmen are currently being pro-
perly oriented into fraternity life by
pledge programs. Further, scholar-
ship receives proper emphasis in
pledge training. But Davidson College
encompasses more: In addition to a
wide range of extra-curricular acti-
vities, Davidson hosts a steady flow
of authorities in many fields and num-
erous talented artists. Many students
have left the college crediting these
extra-classroom activities with pro-
viding the larger part of their educa-
tional experience at Davidson. This is
not difficult to understand when one
considers the ease and excitement of
learning in an informal situation.

Several pledge trainers in recent
years have encouraged their pledges
to participate in a more diversified
manner in campus life and thereby

to understand better the complete
scope of a Davidson education. We en-
courage this year’s pledge trainers
not only to continue but .also to im-
prove this program of full participa-
ion.

We recommend that at the begin-
ning of the pledge program the ‘rain-
ers set certain minimum reoitlire-
ments to be met by the end of the
semester:

These should include attending at
least one Artist Series presentation,
several faculty open houses, one Rey-
nolds lecture, and a set number of
the many other programs on campus,
including a balanced number of
drama presentations, concerts, Great
Issues programs, sporting events,
Book-of-the-Semester, Open End, and
various club programs.

That there is an element of com-
pulsion in such a program is true, but
compulsion is not foreign to the
pledge program. Certainly the com-
pulsion is minimized in the wide selec-
tion of both times and events which
would be open to the pledges.

Some will say that a program such
as this is trying to make a student
into something he is not: “You’re try-
ing to mold him. He’s not that kind of
fellow.” This, however, is not true.
The pledge would have a great. deal
of freedom of selection.

Further, he is not being compelled
to take part on a fulltime basis; rath-
er, he is merely being exposed to a
facet of campus life that he might
otherwise overlook. Such a program
would provide opportunities not onl
for becoming better acquainted wit
Davidson and college, but also for de-
veloping new and broader interests.

THE SOUTHERN LINE-UP

Most political experts agree that Senator Barry Goldwater must carry the South to have any hope
winning the election. As of this month THE DAVIOSONIAN finds the once solid South shaken
by the Goldwater tide, but not enough to endanger yet the “Johnson steam-roller.”” Later issues
will make for definite predictions.

Richardson Scholar Takes
Hard Look At US Politics

By ALEXIS DOPP

1964-65 Richardson Scholar

Senator Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for the Presidency of the
United States, is not very popular in all Europe, as you perhaps know.

Our opinion about him is
mostly based on his fereign
policy, although there are
more reasons why he is not
our favorite candidate. It is
none of our business, however,
if the people of the United
States would prefer to have a
President who voted against
the Civil Rights Bill, wants to
re-establish some situations
which date back to the last
century, and who appeals to
extremism. .

I don’t intend either to con-
demn or praise any part of
the Republican platform con-
cerning the United States; 1
will merely point out why we
definitly don’t approve of his
foreign policy.

If Senator Goldwater be-
comes a President of the United
States he will follow the
foreign policy of Eisenhower
and Dulles. What the Senator
meant to say in this statement
is not quite clear.

However, if one considers
his statements about the
foreign policy he has in mind,
it becomes quite clear that he
intends to follow the “tough”
Dulies, the man of the “roll-
back” of communism, and the
man who intended to subject
the Western allies to an “‘agoniz-
ing reappraisal,” to get them
better in line.

There was, however, a dis-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

THE DAVIDSONIAN wel-
comes letters from any read-
er, either in support of or
differing from its polictes.
Letters should be typewrit-
ten, doubled-speced, and
should not exceed 250 words.

We also will receive longer
articles, but request thet
they be cleared with the edi-
tor.

tn order to be printed in
the following issue, letters
should be received not later
than 4 p. m. Wednesday. All

crepancy between the words
and the deed of Dulles, and
the question is, whether Sena-
tor Goldwater will do the

same, or will actually add deed

to word.

Goldwater thinks “Atlantic-
ly,”’ i. e., he doesn’t want Ameri-
ca and Europe to be separated,
but he sees the NATO ailiance
as a vital part of the Western
strategic. power. Thus the Wes-
tern aliies have become the
instrument of a neo roll-back
policy, in comparison with
which Dulles’ policy is weak.

For example: In his book
Conscience of a Conservative
Senator Goldwater wrote about
the possible reoccurrence of a
revolution in Eastern Europe
like in 1956 in Hungary. In
this case he plans to send an
ultimatum to the Kremlin,
prohibiting Russian  interfer-
ence, and if this is not accept-
ed, nucleac forces will be sent
to the troubled spot.

The purpose of this is con-
front Russia with a superior
force in immediate vicinity of
the place of the revolution. In
this way the Soviet troops
would be forced to retreat.
Especially the last phrase
sounds very simple. They just
Tetreat.

Do the Western Allies want
to be the instruments of such
a foreign policy? The answer
is a definite “no.”

The Western Allies have for

out armed power; they have put
up with the status quo of an
ideologically divided Europe,
hoping that sometime the situa-
tion would improve.

Above all the Western allies
have wanted to avoid that
change in the status quo which.
would result in a war, whose
first immediate result would
be a radioactive ruin on both
sides of the demarcation line.

Goldwater. will, or at least
he says he will, take risks with
his European allies. These al-
lies will probably be somewhat
less than eager to follow him.

We do not want the idea that
a somewhat wild President of
the United States of America
would improve in a nuclear
war.

That is perhaps the main rea-
son why we do not like the
idea of Senator Goldwater be-
coming a President.

Even To Davidson Campus
Come Political Folk Rites

BY MICHAEL L. HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Managing Editor
Once again a Presidential election is upon the
“Davidson” — dusty cliches floating lazily above short-
cropped haircuts in Chambers and emotive arguments
streaming from nearsighted minds in “bull sessions.’’
While doubtless the Presidential election of the

oe gp

} Year of Our Lord Nineteen Hundred and Sixty-four will

generate bursts of enthusiasm on many campuses, some
genuine, it is still safe to make the prediction that we at
Davidson will observe the hullabaloo with the same gen-
eral degree of interest we show our football team, Colum-
bus Day, and the Scripts ‘n Pranks.

Probably the Johnson-Goldwater battle at Davidson
will resemble a strange kind of twilight zone of gray
light where intellect and emotions. simmer but never
come to a boil.

Perhaps this is good. At any rate we won't be ac-
cused of letting our emotions run away with our heads.

Doubtless a general apathy on the part of the stu-
dent body shall prevail. This is not to say that it will.

Really, this is quite a shame. When else in history
shall we have a choice between Big-Bop Barry and Live-
It-Up Lyndon? The Davidsonian invites your comments.

A partisan study of American elections suggests that
God-Truth-Flag and Family generally reside in the party
out of power. This year the Republican Party is no ex-
ception—after all WASPS also need representation. And
after this election so will the Republicans.

The Democrats can take credit for Prosperity and
Poverty—Hubert Humphrey and Lyndon Johnson (one
is not certain that the order should be reversed), but not
for the incredible bungling of Republican political strate-
gy. This recently seems to have become a GOP tradition
at home and abroad.

Meanwhile, what a magnificent time we Davidson
intellectuals shall have this fall raving over the Demo-
Duo of Tweeddlededum and Tweeddlededee, shrieking
over every sophomoric aphorism from the owner of Her
and Him.

Or if we side with the cavemen, how we shall shake
our spears and howl when the man in the jetplane makes
his latest retraction! And how we will burn newspapers
and look for “pinko” professors!

From now until election day The Davidsonian
will be hanging breathlessly on the word uttered by the
Davidson Weejun. Like that of most old shoes, the aroma
will probably reflect the state of mind.

While no doubt we shall occasionally print the na-
tional predictions and observations compiled by our
editorial staff, the primary emphasis in the political field
for us will be the relevance of these rites of fall to the
Davidson student. To be relevant will be quite an ambi-
tious task.

The editorial columns, of course, will take a stand for
and/or against one of the two men on white horses. The
remainder of the editorial pages will continue coverage
of normal editorial features, plus periodic articles of
analysis and wit within the political field.

Contributors will be welcomed with open arms.

_ One closing comment: It has been long said that the
chief contribution of the average Davidson student is his
celebrated apathy. Perhaps this is the year of political
campaigns that his particular talent shall prove most

useful to the country.
