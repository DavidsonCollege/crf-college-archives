With nine starters returning
from last year’s 7-2 team, field
hockey coach Susan Roberts is
optimistic about the 1977 sea-
son.

Six freshman girls were
starters on last year’s young
team and are all back for the
current 15-game campaign,
which includes perennially
tough Duke and the Univer-

sity of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
“It will definitely be a

winning season,’ Roberts pre-
dicts.

Farrell uses same approach

By PAUL BANTA

What is Davidson’s football
team doing differently?

Only two games into the
1977 season, the Wildcats
have already matched their
victory total of last year, and
seem to be headed toward the
mythical winning season. It’s
not like it hasn’t been done
here—it’s just that it has been
so long.

Although the results have
been dramatically different,
Coach Ed Farrell is still using
the same approach he has used
to rebuild three previous pro-
grams and has stuck with
since arriving in Davidson in
early 1974.

“It’s evident progress has
been made,’’ Farrell said while
taking a break from prepara-
tion for Saturday's visit to
Bucknell, ‘‘But I think we’ve
improved each year. From the
outside, it might not have
looked like it, but we’ve been
improving.”

Farrell doesn’t like making
timetables for success of a
program and there wasn’t one
for the Wildcats.

“I never established a time-
table as far as producing a
winning team,” he said. ‘‘It’s
a mistake to do that. Certain
situations, such as injury and
the schedule, which you have
no control over, can affect it.

‘‘Prior to my arriving,’’
Farrell recalled, ‘it was like
asking the coach to play poker
for high stakes saying I'll give
you three cards and I’ll take
five.”’

But the silver-haired Far-
rell, who the players and
coaches affectionately call the
‘“Fox’’, came at a time when
the direction of the program
was changing from scholar-
ships to need grant-in-aids.
The school was not abandon-
ing football, as*some feared,
but was only moving it to a
more reasonable level.

‘Before coming to David- .

son, I looked at the program
and the opponents,” he said.

‘‘Some coaches think they can

outcoach other coaches. It's
more important to look at the
opponents’ programs instead
of the coaching. I wanted to be
at a place where there wes the
chance to be successful.

‘‘Recruiting was our first
major concern here,’’ he con-
tinued. ‘‘After a while, reten-
tion was just as important.
Last year we only lost three—
all freshmen—and this year
we've only lost one. Winning
will help.

“The think the fans are the
quickest to praise or criticize
the handling of the team on
the field, is not as important,”’
he pointed out. ‘“‘In winning a
particular game, it’s impor-
tant, but in building a winning
program it’s not. I learned a
long time ago, it’s better to
have the right player running
the wrong play than the wrong
player running the right

’ play.”

In reflecting back on his
first three teams at Davidson,
Farrell believes the difference
between those and the fourth
edition is the result of the
steady, if slow, improvement,

not just an overnight change. ~

‘‘On the field, we were
better the first year than the
second,”’ he said. ‘‘We still
had some good athletes such
as Dave Harper, George Wie-
cker and Eddie Womack who
were recruited after the 1969
bow! season. The other classes
were not as talented.

‘We showed some improve-
ment on the field last year,” he
continued. ‘‘I thought we had
an outside shot at being .500.

there was tremendous enthu-

siasm.”

That enthusiasm has carried
over to this fall and is one of
the major characteristics of
this year’s squad as it moves
to destroy the Wildcats’ losing

tradition.

“It's not done yet,” Farrell
admitted, ‘but we've got a leg
up on it.”

Sports note—When asked
last week before the Washing-
ton & Lee game whether his
son, Pete, a sophomore at
W&L, would be rooting for his
father or his school, Ed Farrell
replied, ‘He'll be pulling for
the one that pays his tuition.”

Hockey reopens

the team this year, including
five freshmen, all of whom
should see considerable play-
ing time.

Nancy Brown and Beth
Tanner, both seniors, and
Kirk Cameron, a junior and a
Deep-South Team pick in '76,
will lead the Wildcats into
their season opener against
Catawba College on Septem-
ber 27.

This game will be the Wild-
cats’ first under a new playing
system designed to generate a
stronger offensive attack and
increase the scoring output. In
1976 they found the goal
twenty-eight times while hold-
ing nine opponents to a total
of eight goals.

Roberts believes Davidson
will win their first two games
with ‘‘no problem’’.

A tough October schedule
follows, including the Duke
and Carolina contests and a
doubleheader with Appala-
chian State and a touring
British squad, but Roberts
feels confident.

‘‘I see no weak points,
except maybe a lack of exper-
ience using the new system,
but it should work out,’’ she
concluded.
