1970 Calendar Change
Appears Unlikely—Coble

Only a slight chance ap-
parently exists that the 1970
-71 academic calendar pdb-
lished in THE DAVIDSON-
IAN earlier this quarter will

be changed,

The calendar will be
brought up again before the
Faculty Executive Commit-

tee, but SGA President Ran
Coble is skeptical of the
chances for revision.

If the proposed calendar
were~altered, probably the
only schedule which could be
put in its place is the one
which the school is using
this year.

Another possible calendar,
which like the already pub-
lished one would include the
split winter term but would
allow for a late May gradu-
ation and would also have
the fall quarter finished be-
fore Thanksgiving, has al-
ready been rejected by the
Executive Committee

The. main reason
demise was a football schedu-
ling conflict with the fall ex-
am periad.

Coble talked with Dean of
Faculty Frontis W. Johnston
soon after the proposed 1970-
71 Calendar was released, in-
forming Him that many stu:

for its

dents had voiced displeasure
with it. ‘v

At that time, Johnston
stated that there was little
hope of changing what was
already public. Coble then
asked whether the calendar
might ‘be reconsidered if a
referendum were héld ‘and
the results showed obvious
student discontent with the
proposed schedule.

Johnston said that such an
event might prompt -recon-
sideration, so the Senate at
Coble’s suggestion conducted
a referendum on the calen-
dar Jan, 27.

The results of the referen-
dum showed student disen-
chantment with Executive
Committee’s calendar. Given
three schedule choices and
asked to list them in order
of preference, 44.8% of the
students who voted listed the
proposed calendar as their
last choice.

Only 20.9% listed it as their
first choice.

Confronted with these re-
sults, Johnston agreed to re-
introduce the calendar before
the Executive Committee.

But the relative lateness of
this school year, among othe®™®
factors, makes it rather un-

likely that the much-malign-
ed 1970-71 calendar will be

changed, said Coble.

The letter, which was pre

Sam Johnson, Tom Opie, and
Cary Tucker, stated that in
the belief of those who
pared the letter a miscar
riage of justice had occurred
in'a recent Honor Court case
and that the handling of the
case presented a dangerous
precedent. :

Sophomore Senator Danny
Clodfelter presented a criti-
que of the action involving
area studies, saving that he
felt that many of the prob-
lems ~currently confronting
the College on this subject
had arisen because current
problems and long range
plans had not been Considered

acted on area exams.

Currently, he said, the fac-
ulty is offering a number of
proposals. dealing with area
studies.

In conjunction with the ac-
tion of the faculty; he pro-
posed six criteria for the
planning of area studies and
asked that his list be endors-
ed by the Senate.

He suggested that the area

Action was proposed by the
SGA Committee on Educa-

placement of one student at

The proposal would involve

ment being selected by the

This person would sit in on

of making graduate school
recommendations and would
