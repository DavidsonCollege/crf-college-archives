Davidson’s endowment fell 28
percent from just over $500 million
in July 2008 to $362 million at the
end of December. The drop is un-
surprising given the rapid deterio-
ration of the stock market in the lat-
ter parts of 2008 and Davidson has
fared comparatively well, school
officials say.

The school has cut the operat-
ing budget by 2.5 percent for the
remainder of the fiscal year, which
ends in July, and is targeting a three
percent cut for the 2009-2010 fis-
cal year. Despite budget cuts, the
school aims to protect the current
student experience and avoid lay-
offs, according to President Ross in
an interview.

The school’s operating budget
relies on several sources of revenue
including tuition revenue, room
and board charges, and a payout
from the endowment. The yearly
payout equals five percent of the
endowment’s five-year rolling av-
erage. The value of the endowment
on Dec. 31 became the amount av-
eraged for this fiscal year, immedi-
ately creating a deficit.

While there was some concern
over spring enrollment, and there-
fore tuition revenue, fewer students
have withdrawn compared to recent
semesters, and more students have
returned to campus after studying
abroad during the fall semester.

President Ross addressed Da-
vidson’s financial position in a

Davidson community, reporting
losses to the endowment as well
as the school’s plan to weather the
economic downtum.

“This is a time of real uncer-
tainty,” Ross said. “We are con-
stantly monitoring and constantly
planning for different scenarios.”

Ross hopes to streamline the
school’s budget through reductions
in non-essential spending, such as
faculty travel. The school has also
enacted a hiring freeze, and Ross
expects salaries to remain constant

said. “To do everything we can not

Students face bleak job market

ANDREW EVANS
Staff Writer

Despite all of the gloomy re-
ports about the job market these
days, there appears to be a silver
lining for college students and re-
cent graduates.

The National Association of
Colleges and Employers (NACE)
projected, in its Job Outlook 2009
Special Report, a 1.3 percent in-
crease in job hirings for the class of
2009 relative to the class of 2008.

Unemployment is on the rise
nationally. According to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics, the unemploy-
ment rate in North Carolina rose
from 4.7 to 8.7 percent from Dec.
2007 to Dec. 2008, and the national
rate rose to 7.2 percent.

“This is the highest monthly
rate for at least the last 16 years,”
stated the Jan. 2009 issue of the
Parents Newsletter. The newsletter
is produced by the Office of Career
Services.

A Jan. 26 New York Times ar-
ticle entitled “Layoffs Spread to
More Sectors of the Economy,”
reported that many companies, in-

cluding such diverse businesses as
Home Depot, Microsoft and Sprint
Nextel, “are resorting to mass job
cuts.”

According to the NACE report,
the majority of industries are pro-
jecting a decrease in hiring of the
class of 2009. “Only government
as a sector saw a Significant in-
crease in hiring expectations, while
manufacturing and professional
services remain essentially flat,”
said the report.

While many companies are lay-
ing off many workers, John Adams,
the Director of the Office of Career
Services, indicated that he does not
know the proportionality of recent
college graduate layoffs to other
layoffs. “We don’t know which
people they’re laying off,” Adams
said.

Other indicators seem to suggest
that college students and graduates
may have an easier time landing a
job than others, Adams indicated.
He said that college graduate un-
employment rates are around one-
third of the general rate, and that
there is a vast difference between
experienced and new hires.

Adams said that new hires are
typically “less expensive,” making
them more attractive to businesses
looking to save money. Also, com-
panies have learned that they have
to keep “some people in the pipe-
line” of talent, he said.

Adams, however, did indicate
some concern about the stability
of the job market. Adams shared
that companies have announced
layoffs the day before interviewing
students for internships here at Da-
vidson, but there is “just a nagging
concern that [the job market] may
not sustain itself.”

General unease about the
market can impact individual job
searches, according to Adams. The
emotional impact of the reports,
such as the New York Times article
mentioned above, can simply sap
the motivation to search for jobs,
the reasoning being that the situa-
tion is so bad that it doesn’t make
any sense to even be looking for a
job.

However, Adams stressed the
importance of persistence. “If you

Whatever one’s take on cur-
rent environmental policy is, na-
tions around the world are turning
their attention to global energy
challenges.

Hoping to bring discussions
about this issue to the forefront
of Davidson’s international con-
sciousness, the Dean Rusk Pro-
gram Student Advisory Com-
mittee (SAC) chose “the Global
Energy Challenge” as the theme
for next year’s Bank of America
Lecture Series.

“The mission of the Dean
Rusk Bank of America Confer-
ence is to expand the Davidson
community’s exposure to salient
international issues, to encour-
age student academic innovation
and to forge relationships with
peer colleges and universities,”
reported Dean Rusk SAC and
Bank of America committee offi-
cers Caroline McDermott ’09 and
Christoph Pross ’10.

In the spirit of this mission,
next year’s lecture series will
have a classroom component — in
the form of independent research
studies or a seminar on energy
resources — so that students can
connect the topics of the lectures
to their academics. The topics to
be addressed will include “energy
security,” “energy in the develop-
ing* world” and “alternative en-

ergy sources.”

The goal of the classroom,
component is to complement
guest speakers’ presentations with
student-led research, writing,
collaboration with faculty and
presentations. At the end of the
2009-2010 academic year, stu-
dents whose research yields par-
ticularly insightful contributions
to the final multi-day conference
and related events will have the
opportunity to present their work.
This would either be in a formal
symposium or in a more interac-
tive format resembling a Model-
U.N. debate forum.

' “We want students to start
thinking about research topics
related to the energy crisis that
they’d like to tackle and to take
advantage of the college’s re-
sources, such as Dean Rusk and
Abernathy grants, research initia-
tive grants for lab projects and
collaboration with faculty. They
could later incorporate summer
research into an independent re-
search study to present during
the final conference,” Pross ex-
