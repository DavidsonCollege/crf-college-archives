From our correspondence and other

returning Davidsonians to come from
those in uniform stationed at camps in
the vicinity. Others, too far away to
revisit the campus for the fete, assure
us that nothing would be more to their
taste than to be present. and that they
will be thinking of us throughout the

We would like to assure citem in re-

are repaid with interest, and to tell them

reason, will be considered a special

Home-Coming ...

Home-Coming is here again. Perhaps
foc the same Tlome Coming it has been,
perhaps not the same it would have
been. And yet it has a number of fea
tures which should make it the best in
the history of the holiday.

The returning alumni. will miss the
annual tour around the campus to ob-

“serve, and criticise, the changes and
revel in tales of old times. They wiil
miss the alumni funcheon in the banquet
hall, for it could not possibly be the
same anywhere else, they maintain.

They will miss. the festive aumosphere
that the fraternity decorations always
provided. They will miss their annual
opportunity of ‘slipping’ a stifi and
rusted grip <o their old and de new

brothers within the memory-hallowed
halls of their particular lodges.

They will fecl a real sense of loss at
missing their only opportunity of resum-
ing. it only for a night. the carefree
tcllowship that was dormitory life, and
repeating the unforgettable experience
ol a collegiace “bull session”.

mr They will miss most of all faces of —

classmates, handshakes of friends cut
sori by the citeumstanees which mar the
celebration.
_ Hee tvaeancies in seats that have not
been empty at a Home-Coming since the
graduations of their respective years.
- The later generations witl see chairs
vacamt in tribute to their owners de-
tending the ideals of which the reunion
is an evidenee,_

Yet the celebration will -not lose its
most valuable aspects. It should not be
the environment, but the fellowship that
provides the spirit of the occasion.

Those who return for the weck-end
will be those who have a decp and real
interest in the college and in the friends
they expect to find in attendance. Those
who attend will have to make a material
effort to do so this year.

A_full program, although dif fering
somewhat from the customary one, has
been planned for the alumni, and no
disappointment is expected from any
quarter, The older ones will find their

Holidays ...

\We are glad that the Christinas holi-
day question was finally settled, and
without bloodshed. Already the rumor
machine had started circulating “‘defi-
nite” reports of decisions ranging from
six wecks to one day sandwiched be-
tween double cuts.

This rumor business, no matter how
strongly emphasized; continually, pops
out of hand. [f those who advertise
their speculations as unquestionable fact
would stop to consider some of the
damage they cause, we cannot believe
these wild tales would continue. Think

The sports department mentions the
valiant showing the team made in Lex-
ingion Saturday, but we consider it
time that there was some evidence that
everyone is interested in the boys.

Forgetting that it has faced one of —

the hardest sehedules in its history, and
ignoring the execllent showing the team
has been making all season, in spite of ~
some awtully hard “breaks” and long
\rips. some of us, we fear, have become
discouraged as to the oudlook for the
season as a whole.

The unmistakable victory last week
should be sutficient to arouse the inter-

. est:ol even the “fair weather friends”

and convinee them that if we, the stu-
deni body. back the."Cats, we can and
will BENT CAROLINA!

_.. By JOHN FAIRLY

No advice as to the things a man
at Davidson should seek to, accom.
plish is so valuable as that of those
nren who now took back upon their
college life here, realizing wherein
they succeeded and owherein they
failed ‘to take advantage of their
opportunities. This indisputable fact
makes Dr. MacGavock’s timely
chapel talk last Monday worthy
nNut_only of attention, but- also: of
eareful contemplation.
