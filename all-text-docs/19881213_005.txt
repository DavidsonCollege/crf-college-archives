Beyond Davidson: National Affairs

Business ‘
Last week, Kohlberg Kravis finally
pulled off their 25.07 billion dollar buyout
of R.J.R Nabisco and there appear to be few
losers in this historic deal. So far, the big-
gest winners are the investment banking

firms that financed: the deal as they are

guaranteed at least 10 million dollars even
if the agreement falls through. Of all the
firms, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
stands to gain the most, an estimated 227
million dollars if all goes well. Locally,
workers in Winston-Salem could stand to
lose their jobs if Kohlberg Kravis decides
to sell off the R.J.R. subsidiaries.

Atlantic Telephone and Telegraph
(AT&T) and U.S. Sprint were awarded 60
and 40 % respectively of the federal gov-
ernment’s telecommunication’s contract

on Wednesday. The ten year deal valued
between 3 and 10 billion dollars should
provide. a big financial boost for struggling
Sprint. Sprint, which had been running a
distant third in the: recent long distance
wars, edged out M.C.I. and Martin Mari-
etta to land their share of the contract.
The new system will be the largest of its
type in the world and will link over one
million government workers across 1,311
locations. It will handle approximately 1.6
million calls a day and roughly 220 million
a year. The new system is designed to save

an estimated 100 million dollars a year in.

phone bills.

Defense

Pentagon officials have announced a
delay in deployment of the newly designed
stealth bomber. In an effort to ease the

Defense department’s budget crunch, full
deployment will not occur until the 1990’s.
The Air Force had originally hoped that the
production of the Northrop Corporation’s
state of the art B-2 bomber would make it
operational within the next few years. The
stealth is believed to be able to fly great
distances, unnoticeable to radar.

Government

The Bush transition team continues to
move quickly in appointing anew Cabinet
by the first of the year. Already several
Reagan appointees have been asked to stay
on, most noticeably attorney General Rich-
ard Thornburg and Education Secretary
Lauro Cavazos. President-elect Bush has
been very loyal to his supporters naming
campaign director Lee Atwater to head the
R.N.C. and long time Bush supporter,

James Baker, as Secretary of State. .

New Hampshire Governor John Sununu
will be the new White House Chief of Staff
and Nicholas Brady will be the Secretary of
Treasury. The Bush transition team is ex-
pected to name the Secretary of Defense
later this week and. all indications are that
former Texas Senator John Tower will man
that post.

P.T.L.

- In the never ending saga that has sur-
rounded P.T.L. the past two years, de-
frocked minister Jim Bakker was indicted
on Tuesday by a federal grand jury. Bakker
and former P.T.L. executive vice president
Richard Dortch were charged with 24
counts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and con-
spiracy in the indictment returned by the
Charlotte grand jury.

Committee battles misperceptions of ‘‘date rape”’

“It’s amazing,” says Human Resources head. “Many women don't even know they've been raped.”

By HEATH HARDAGE

Rape is not a subject which is
often discussed at Davidson.
Rumors circulate from time to
time about assaults on campus,
but as one junior said, “‘I haven’t
been informed [of any rapes] that
occured.’’ Assistant Dean of Stu-

dents Harriette Fulton confirmed:

this, saying that to her knowledge,
in her four years at Davidson, no
“*stranger rapes’’ had been com-
mitted.

What - has become a growing.
concern at Davidson, however, is
the incidence of date or acquain-
tance rape. “‘I’d ‘say 25% of
Davidson women have been date-
raped,”’ said senior Karla deBeck,
who is head of the Human Re-
sources Committee. “‘It’s amaz-
ing: many women don’t even
know they’ve been raped.’’ She
defined date rape: ‘‘Even if you
were too tired and too drunk and
said no, but he did it [sexual inter-
course] fetbvta dp it’s still date
rape.”” ©
She aed ‘that sales _and
Queens. College imports’ are
more vulnerable to date rape. ‘‘I
had a friend from Salem who was —
date-raped,””’ she disclosed. *‘Inci-
dents [of date rape} are found out
more often when: they concem :
other schools. Their dean will call
Davidson.”’

Alcohol is a prevalent factor in
[approximately] 70-80%, of. the
date rape incidents, said deBeck.
‘‘Her resistance is.down, and his
adrenaline is going.”’ She also
sed hat alot of guys wiley

Alltoooten th victim msof such
rapes are afraid to tell anyone |
about their experience. _

The. primary. reason for their

‘is that ‘‘they feel lik

be “under the influence of some-

Thus, the victim _

thing”’ she
may feel like s
trol to begin with,-: Seceear
Davidson men, in | deBeck’ s
view, ‘‘are basically ‘clueless’’
about the sis “I don’t think ~

they’re going to be active [in pre-
vention] at all. They just don’t
think aboutit.”’

She stated that many other stu-
dents on-campus don’t get in-
volved in the issue because ‘‘a lot
of people at Davidson concentrate

on their work and think, ‘Oh, P’ll

29?

leave that to the police.

Fulton described her involve-
ment with the Human Resources
Committee. She said that the
Committee’s main goal is to
“educate: students bout acquain-
tance rape.”* She also said, “My
impression is that [the group] was
formed as a result ofacquaintance
rape. 7?

The Committee — to provide
a 24 hour rape hotline and coun-
seling service. However, these
services were hardly ever used.

As a result, the hotline was dis-_

continued, and the counseling
aspect has been taken over by the
Counseling Center here on cam-
pus.
Fulton said that the reason for
the lack of use of Human Re-

~ source facilities was dtie_to the

fact that ‘‘there is not much ano-
hymity in a small campus like
this.’’ Students were apparently
seeking help off campus for rea-

‘sons of confidentiality.

“It’s hard for someone who ex-

a peneness this to.come forward,”’
ulton: explained.

However, the Committee still
retains aroom in the Union which
contains resource materials on the
subject. The group gives out rape
pamphlets to freshmen each fall,
and this year, it has sponsored
both a forum on dating at
Davidson and a speaker on sexual

harassment.

Future. plans for the Human
Resources Committee include an
AIDS forum in January, a video
concerning rape to be shown on
the freshmen halls with a discus-
sion following, a program on self-
défense and a speaker on date rape
in the spring.

If .a woman has been date-
raped, Fulton said that she should
seek help at the dean’s office; the
infirmary or the Counseling Cen-
ter, ‘‘I’ve referréd'a few people
there [to the Counseling Center],”’
shejsaid. She also said that ‘‘it’s
not unheard of for this [a date rape
case] to goto the Honor Council.’’

Unlike deBeck, Fulton believes
that there is a “‘growing concern
among the men, especially hall
counselors, concerning date
rape.”” She did admit that the

Phonathon earns over $200,000.
