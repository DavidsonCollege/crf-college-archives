Davidsonian: This past

weekend, the Board of Trustees
met and discussed several impor-
tant issues — the school's invest-
ment policy, a new funds cam-

among other things. What, in your
opinion were some of the most
most crucial matters acted upon
by the Board in relation to the fu-

The decision to deny tenure to
Davidson English professor Dr.
John Engell, revealed to students
last week after the May 1 meeting
of the Board of Trustees approved
it, has aroused a storm of. con-
troversy, .especially from those
who have studied under him. A
denial of tenure means that Dr.
Engell will not be allowed to teach
at Davidson after next term, and it
will almost certainly affect ad-
versely his ability to find future
employment.

Many of his former students
have taken actions to try to per-
suade the administrators to re-
verse their decision; however, ac-
cording to Vice President Robert
C. Williams, the decision has al-
ready been made by the Board of
Trustees and is final. While the
Trustees approved tenure for Dr.
Cole Barton, Dr. Irwin Goldstein,
Dr. Ralph Levering and Dr. John
Heil; according to Dean Williams,
after reviewing Dr. Engell’s per-
formance at Davidson, he decided
for reasons that are strictly confi-
dential that Engell should not be
granted tenure.

_ In a statement released to
the student body, Williams
explained that “Teaching, profes-
sional development, and service
to the college and community all

stances represent culmination of a
lot of study and thought. We are
not through with discussion of the
Capital Funds drive as you know.
We did a kind of a dry run of what
we are calling a “Focus Meeting”
which is really a piece of a feasi-
bility study to see if the kinds of
projections we are making about
necessary funding as we see it are
reasonable:in terms of the giving
capacity of Davidson’s con-
stituents.

So that’s in process; it’s not re-

ally adecision but it’s another step-— .

along the way. We’ll come back
to the Board in October with a lit-
tle more information. I anticipate

either in October or February

being «able to say “O.K. folks,
here it is, it’s laid out — please

weigh in the tenure decision.”
“Professional development” re-
fers to ongoing scholarly activ-
ity — such as research and pub-
lishing. Many students have
speculated that it was in this area
that Dr. Engell was judged to have
fallen short, but there has been no
statement made to suggest this
conclusively; the faculty must re-
main silent on the subject, as must
Williams and Kuykendall.

The faculty has little part in
any tenure decisions; Williams
explains that, although other pro-
teseors offer aavice, Davidson is
unusual in that such decisions
have been allocated entirety to
hirn andr Kuykendall, and they
seek the approval of the Trustees.
He suggests that perhaps peer
evaluation is a better method for
the decision to releagy Qs. Engell
was certainly aot made in haste.
Fesfewing sormal procedure, ne
began wo cvatuate mose professors
whose six years of experience
made them eligible in the early
fall. '

His statement mentions that
tenure is “a decision which can
only be positive if and only if there

are absolutely no doubts about an -

individual’s past paerformance
and. possibilities for future con-
tribution to the life of the college.”

He explains that the matter has
been completely silenced because

- tenure is a “judgement call” and

that a grant of tenure constitutes a
permanent decision — perhaps a
permanent error. Thus, the tenure
decisions are a highly sensitive
topic which faculty members will '

not discuss with the student body.

gell’s have circulated a petition in
favor of reinstating Engell; signs
have been posted in Chambers.

The facuty voted 56 to 50 to
switch to a semester system with a
34 credit graduation requirement
to take effect the 1988-89 school
year. eso
The 34 course requirement is
an compromise between the origi-
nally proposed 32 course require-
ment and a 36 course proposal,
which was made during the course
of the two-hour meeting. The
extra courses were added to pro-
vide for broader educational op-
portunities. Furthermore, there
was some concern expressed that
students would be given more free
time that would not be used con-
structively. .
The new graduation require-
ments mean that students who

don’t have any advanced place-

eleven classes over a two year
period, meaning a teaching load
of three classes for three terms,
and two classes for one.

‘By switching to the semester
system, Davidson will have a
calendar that is consi with

According to Williams, the
new system will allow for easier
transfer of students and faculty

from other institutions. Also,

more time will be allowed for in-

courses and independent study.
Details still have to be worked
in the system concerning matters
such as core curriculum and the
impact upon students who are al-
ready enrolled when it takes ef-
fect. Williams said that the classes
of 1989 and 1990 should still ex-

The SGA and the Educational

new system. “There is going to be:
an active dialogue between the
student body and the EPC,” said
SGA President Conrad Doenges.
Doenges feels that a lot of stu-
dent input will mean that there
will be fewer kinks to be worked
out when the system takes effect.
