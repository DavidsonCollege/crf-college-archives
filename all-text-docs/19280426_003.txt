Track Team To Enter

Inter -

The State Intercollegiate Track
Meet will be held this year on the fourth
and fifth of May in Greensboro. To this
track meet, are invited teams from all the
colleges in North Carolina.

Last year Davidson sent ‘a track team
up to this meet, and came within an ace
of carrying off the honors. Currie easily
won the hundred and the two-twenty
yard dashes, setting new state records in
each case. The hundred was run in the
phenomenal time ‘of nine and six-tenths
seconds, just one-tenth of a point slower
than the world’s record in this event. The
relay team, composed of Currie, Pinkney,
Melton and Kell easily won the mile re-
lay, and were presented with a statue of
a relay runner as a trophy.

This year, with Currie back, and Whittle
from the last year fresh team in good
shape, the Davidson team should take
first and second places in both the hun-
dred and the 220. In the hurdles, Brown
and Whittle are in rare form and should
both win points. Bailey and Smith are
doing well in the pole vault, and Leftwich
is throwing the shot further than he has
ever done before. The half-mile relay
team can be counted on to push somebody
hard for first place in that event, with
Whittle, Currie, Flynn, and Kell running
on it.

The track team this year has several
exceptionally good sprinters, and runners,
and it is not in that. phase of the meet,
but rather in the field events that the
team is weakest. With the other teams
of the state splitting up on the events,
and the Davidson team securing points
in the hurdles, the hundred, the 220 and
the 440, the Wildcats have a very good

_ chance to win the meet. And the men on
the team realize this, and are putting
forth every effort to improve the team he-
fore the meet comes off.

“SCABBARD AND BLADE
EXTEND FORMAL BIDS

April 18th, public recognition was made of
the 13 cadets receiving bids from the local
Scabbard and Blade fraternity. At this
time a review was given in their honor. The
pledged cadets, three of whom were Seniors,
have previously been announced.

The national fraternity of Scabbard and
Blade will hold its sixteenth annual conven-

Wingate Defeated By
Davidson Freshmen

After struggling fifteen innings Tues-
day, April 17, only to end up in a 2-2 tie,
the Davidson Wildkittens hit their stride
and defeated Wingate in the second game
‘which was played at Davidson on Friday,
April 2oth.

Both teams were in fine shape and
played a very fast game. The Kittens
couldn’t get right at first and it wasn't
until the lucky seventh when “Pat” Mc-
Callum drove a hot liner through the
second-baseman scoring the two men that
were on the bases that things brightened
up for the Freshmen, They brought in
another run before the inning closed and
‘the game was apparently sewed up.

The Wingate team played nice ball but
was unable to put up with the fight that
the Kittens gave them. Marks and Gib-
son each obtained a three base hit off of
Efird. Thompson pitched a fine game for
the Kittens and his mates gave him their
best support. He struck out seven men
and allowed only eight hits.

McCallum led the Freshmen at the bat
and is entitled to the batting honors of the
game. Efird was on the mound for the
opponents and allowed only five hits. The
game was very close with a few spectacu-
lar plays.

Score by innings: R.H. E.
Wingate 100 ooo—1 8 2
Davidson Fresh ---000 000 300—3 5 I

Box score—Davidson vs. Wingate.

Davidson To Meet
Lenoir-Rhine Nine

The Davidson nine is scheduled to play
the Lenoir-Rhyne baseball team at Hick-
ory, tomorrow.

This marks one of the most important
epochs of the season. Both teams are
evenly matched and the honor for highest
score is an object for close contention.
Last year the Wildcats shut the Moun-
tain Bears out with a score of 11-3, and sd
far this season have shown up well in
their encounters.

The Hickory team bowed before Elon

Trabue was elected alternate delegate.
