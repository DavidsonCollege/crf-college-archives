‘Students Bring Great Expectations to Stage

By Whitney Jewett

The magic and splendor of
Charles Dickens’ fictionis brought
to life on stage in the sensational
production of Great Expectations.
Dickens evokes in his fiction a
spectrum of emotion so vast and
encompassing thatone might deem
it near impossible to recreate his
work on stage. The Davidson pro-
duction of Great Expectations
draws the audience into a world in
which the imagination takes flight
atop the looming London fog. One
experiences with Pip the exhilara-
tion and frustration of each con-

Flick Review ...
Untamed

Heart Should
Stop Beating

By Will Lazenby and
Mary McCrory

Some people liked this movie.
We don’t know why. We admit,
we too were enticed by names like
Marisa Tomei (who was so feisty
in “My Cousin Vinny”) and Chris-
tian Slater (“Pump up the Vol-
ume,” “Young Guns 2,” “Heath-
ers” — need we say more?).

Even ‘the previews looked

good. After all, they were set to”

“Tom’s Diner,” (Suzanne Vega)
and it was a movie about a diner.
How could they go wrong?

But they did. The movie is -

about Caroline (Marisa Tomei), a
waitress in Jim’s Diner, who never
follows through with anything.
That’s her big problem.

Christian Slater has a prob-
lem, too. For one, he can’t talk for
the first half hour of the movie, but
aside from that, he has a diseased
heart. Get it? “Untamed?”

So everyone has problems,
and Tomei and Slater’s characters
fall in love. After he saves her
from being raped, he decorates a
Christmas tree in a room without
waking her up and plays her some
pretty music.

There’s the plot (except for
the end —we’re nottelling!). Now
the acting. Yuck. Rosie Perez is
notas annoying as everyoneelse in
the film.

Marisa Tomei cannot seem to
stop making cute giggling noises.
If she isn’t doing that, she is mak-
ing doe eyes at Christian Slater.

Christian Slater can’t finish
any of his sentences, and spends a
lot of his time looking sheepish.
The only acting that is any good at
all is done by two very minor char-
acters, both named Bill.

In other words, don’t go see
this unless you wanttohear“‘Tom’s
Diner,” or meet Bill and Bill. You
will be able to predict almost ev-
erything thathappens. Thisis not
a prescription for a good night at
the movies. Avoid this one like the
plague. Hated it.

flict he must endure and overcome.
Indeed, this performance captures
the indescribable spirit of Charles
Dickens’ fiction.

The power of prose and per-
formance are joined successfully
through the character of Pip, played
by Bradley Griffin. Griffin does a
magnificent job of portraying both
the young and the older Pip. The
older Pip guides the audience
through some changes and transi-
tions, while the younger Pip expe-
riences, as if for the first time, the
conflicts set before him. His be-

Pip, played by Bradley Griffin, confesses his love to Estella (Allison Wright) in Thursday nights

wildered and boyish actions are
opposed by the overpowering and
frightening Magwitch, played by
Ed Cunningham.

Cunningham’s portrayal of
Dickens’ escaped adds life and sus-
pense tothe performance. Through
the fog, Magwitchis first seen shak-

- ing poor Pip over the grave of his
mother and father. Here, the fright
and the power evoked are a combi-
nation of superb acting, technique,
and sound effects.

Pip’s amiable and devoted
friend, play by Edwin Thomas,

serves as a constant reminder of
the values of true friendship and
innocence. His quiet authenticity
add charm and vitality to the play.
Allison Wright, the beautiful
and proud Estella, does a magnifi-
centjob portraying a shrunken soul
that has been smothered by a gilded
facade if finery and gems far too
long. Pip’s infatuation with the
celestial Estella is a source of iden-
tifiable pain and frustration. One
questions the value of social value
when true friends are at risk.
This frustration is also appar-

ent in the withered character of
Mrs. Havisham, played by Jenni-
fer Neale. Neale evokes the tre-
mendous suffering of the scarred
Miss Havisham with controlled vi-
brance and poise.

Jaggers, a pompous London
lawyer played by Scott Lenhart,
contributes humor and diversity to
the performance. Biddy (Amanda
Davis), the pure and devoted con-
fidante to Pip, sharply contrasts
the business-like formality of
Jaggers. Pumblechook (Jared
Floyd) and the Aged Parent (Patrick
Brown) are also humorous con-
trasts to the intensity of the other
characters.

The characters of Compeyson
(Robert Pascal), Clara (Catherine
Rivenbark), Herbert (Jonathan
Brooks), Wemmick (Glen Laird),
and Molly (Jessalyn Wynn), all
contribute to the magical vitality
of Great Expectations. The in-
tense devotion that each member
of the cast applies to the produc-
tion is evident by the immense
success in recreating the electric-
ity of Dickens’ fiction on stage.

Dr. Rupert Barber, director,
and Dr. Joseph Gardner, scene de-
signer, have created a performance
that exceeds the limits of Stage
production.

Indulge in the sensation pow-
ers of the imagination. Great Ex-

' peciations is a treasure unto itself

that should be enjoyed by all. Just
areminder before you go—be pre-
pared to be immersed in London
fog at its worst (the smoke blowers
do their job quite well)!

Short Story...

Two All Beef Patties, Special Sauce, Lettuce,
Cheese, Pickles, Onions on a Sesame Seed Gerund

By Jonathan Harris

The Burger Barn had two new
grammatical problems. One was
the way the customers ordered.
The other was Billy. Both had
been infused with proper syntax,
diction and even rare displays of
Style at the start. But billions and
billions had to be served, and rapid
ordering and dispatch soon over-
shadowed grammar-rooted conver-
sations and the importance of struc-
turally correct food preparation.
In fact, neither friendly conversa-
tion nor good food mattered to the
customers or employees anymore.
“Fries, burger, pie” replaced the
traditional but outdated “hello,”
and burgers were assembled with
so little attention that they were
often mistaken for ketchup-cov-
ered fries. Billy hadn’t always
produced the tangle of misplaced
condiments that were now accepted
occurrences at the Burger Barn,
however. In fact, he had come to
the job hoping to author his own
original burger-style.

On his first day at the Burger
Barn, Billy learned how to con-
struct a’burger. First, put on the
pickles, then the ketchup in three
rings, then some mustard, no, sorry,
onering of mustard, then heat iton
two in the microwave and slide it
out through slot five. “You're a
good man, Billy,” said his man-
ager. “Keep it up.” At first, Billy
did keep it up. He followed the
burger building laws of grammar
and style in crafting meals for the
billions and billions. But tomor-
row was Sunday.

Sunday lunchhadalwaysbeen
steady business because the Free
Will Baptist Church was across
the street. But recently the Burger
Bam had become especially popu-
lar to the time-conscious church-
goers. Christian children squeaked
in the swings of the newly con-
structed Farm Fantasyland while
their parents did the same in the
just finished drive-thru. That Sun-
day, Billy’s family went tochurch.

“Well, what did you think?”
he asked his parents.

“About what?” said his

mother.

"How was the food?” said
Billy.

“Oh, about the same, you
know,” said his mother.

“Yeah, you know,” said his
sister, “pickles and all that.”

“Yeah, I know,” said Billy.

That Monday at work, Billy
watched a woman pay foran onion
tongue-buster he had just made for
her. She zoomed away and ate it
with no complaints. Later, Billy
experimented with different com-

_binations of vegetables and

squeeze-bottle condiments, but
with the same result: no returns.
Next, Billy made burgers that
looked and tasted better than those
his manager had taught him to
make. He washed the vegetables
himself and took special care to
see that the meat was cooked per-
fectly. Still there was no response.
That Thursday, Billy began to be
truly ungrammatical about burgers.
On Thursday, he was making sand-
wiches during a funeral rush—
handing burger after
pickleketchupmustard burger af-

ter burger to his manager when he
realized that no one cared about
extraordinarily delicious or even
good sandwiches. The time-sav-
ing packaging and the familiarity
of the product were all that mat-
teredin the business of burger craft-
ing. The quality was gobbleddown
in a matter of seconds, but the
package and the idea were what
people wanted anyway. Billy real-
ized that he could have put just
about anything between the buns
and, as long as it was wrapped like
a burger, it would be accepted as
such, ~_

From then on, when he heard
“fry, burger, pie” over the drive-
thru microphone, Billy matched
the grammatical complexity of the
order with a product that skipped
Over personal attention, as the cus-
tomer had, and provided a pack-
aged idea ready to speed home to
the kids. Billy’s burgers-went-to
feed the world’s developing brains
with overpickley and too too .
ketchupy sandwiches, and the “you
are what you eat” theory hecame
heresy.
