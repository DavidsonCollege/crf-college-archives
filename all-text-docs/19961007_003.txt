Students complain about voice mail at Siete |

The effectiveness of Davidson
College’s 911 emergency phone
system has recently been called
into question by many students on
campus.

In the September 23rd
Davidsonian, sophomore Brent
Gilbert described in a letter to the
editor an experience in which he
activated an emergency callbox on
campus and was only able to reach
a voice mail system mailbox.

Director of Campus Police

Ray Thrower describes Gilbert’s

which was the result of.a momen-
tary technical malfunction within
the communication system set-up.

However, many students have

reached voice mail after dialing
extention 2178, the campus police
number. Callers can press #1 to
reach 911 in Charlotte, but cannot
talk directly to the campus police.

Some years ago, campus po-
lice cooperated with the Davidson
town police department in form-
ing a joint dispatch service.

Due toa variety of complaints
concerning the town dispatch’s
level of efficiency, however, the
campus police withdrew from the

Mecklenburg Police Department’s

dispatch service. Thrower says of .

this transition, “It was very cost-
effective, and also satisfying in
terms of the level of professional-
ism we encounte:

Currently, a student placing. a
“9-911” emergency call reaches
the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police
dispatcher who then uses radio re-
lay to immediately alert campus
police about the call.

While emergency situations

_ are the campus police force’s top

priority, Thrower says they are
quite aware of the growing con-

for ways to make students feel
more comfortable about contact-
ing us with non-emergency re-
quests.”

Thrower acknowledges that
students were generally more com-
fortable calling the former 892 pre-
fix non-emergency number — the

Davidson town police dispatch — -

than they are calling 911.

BTI Telecommunications
Services, contracted by
Davidson College for student
long-distance telephone sérvice
use, is just one of the companies
the College subscribes to in or-
der to provide students with bet-
ter campus living.

Because companies like
BTI seem to have a monopoly
over the services offered to the
student body, many students are
concerned about the lack of com-
petition which would hold prices
down and keep service high.

Toselect companies to pro-
vide specific services to students
living on campus, Davidson ad-
vertises and sends out applica-
tions which list the criteria of the
contracts under which compa-
nies will be hired; these compa-
nies, in turn, place bids on
Davidson’s contracts.

BTI, whose contracts are
now handled the by Information
Technology Services, has. ca-
tered to the long-distance needs
of Davidson College offices and
dormitories for nearly five years.

This summer, BTI signed a
new two-year contract with

ous six-year contract set to end
next year.

The new agreement was
reached when North Carolina’s
26 private colleges, including
Davidson, jointly negotiated
with several long-distance car-
riers for better rates.

According to BTI’s plan,
prices would fall as more col-
leges contracted with the com-
pany. The large number of col-
leges which contracted BTI led
to cuts in long-distance service
prices.

Contracts offered to com-
panies generally extended for
| three or four years. Recently,
however, shorter contracts, like
- | the one recently signed by’ BTI,

have been the trend.
Less than ten yearsago, stu-’
dents were not offered a pre-

and students arranged for long-
distance service individually.

campus addressing relations be-
tween the U.S. and China, orga-
nized by the Dean Rusk Program.

The conference, sponsored by
a NationsBank grant, will address
various issues involving China and
the U.S.

Ken Brown, Director of the
Dean Rusk Program, says, “we
chose to have the conference on
China because there are many cur-
rent issues involving China ... that
have implications for U.S. -China
relations.”

Browncites China’s rapid eco-
nomic growth rate and the current
situation in Hong Kong as two
major issues.

The Dean Rusk Program’s As-
sistant Director Eleanor Hatcher
adds that China was chosen be-

cause of “the fascinating differ-

ences between the mindset and his-
tory of the Chinese and that of the
U.S.”

The conference will be held
for four days, and will consist of
three key speakers and three panel
discussions. Brown explains, “we
have experts from all around the
country participating in the con-
ference, from local people to as far
away as California ... including

Chair of the Department of History
at Harvard, and Ambassador Chas
W. Freeman, former Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for International
Security Affairs.

The panel participants will
consist of other experts in the field,
including Political Science Profes-

Program, whose goal, according
to the Dean Rusk mission state-
ment, is “to increase understand-
ing of international issues at
Davidson and in the neighboring
community.” Eleanor Hatcher
describes the event as a way to
“concentrate all our energy on one

Brown and Hatcher note that
many people were involved in co-
ordinating the conference, includ-
ing Deputy to the Director Kathie
Faulkner, project coordinators
Mary Margaret Cochrane and
Yasar Ishaq, and Professor Shelley
Rigger.
