QVENG TALKS AT
VESPER SERVICE

Quartet Gives Special Music On
Program Presided Over
By Simpson

“Although business men may be losing
faith in the Blue Eagle, they are not
losing faith in the American flag or the
Cross”; this was the principal thought
in the talk given by Mr. David Ovens,
Prominent Charlotte business man, at the
Y. M. C. A. vespers last Sunday night.

Jimmy Simpson, of the senior class,
presided at the meeting and special music
was rendered by a quartet composed of
Hubert Morris, Charlie Ramseur, Frank
Tucker, and Donald Pfohl, Mr. Tom
Glasgow, who was a speaker at vespers
last fall, introduced Mr. Ovens, who has
held many important positions in the re-
tail organizations of the country.

Mr. Ovens stated that although many
have said that we are living in an in-
teresting age, this was always the case
with every age and that the only thing
that was different about this age was
that many of our old and time-honored
institutions, both economic and religious,
are under fire.

Ovens then switched to a brief dis-
cussion of the soundness of the govern-
ment. He said: ‘Although there are many
things about the government that I don’t
like, I believe that it is fundamentally
sound, and that President Roosevelt js
a sound Christian leader.”

The speaker then remarked that the
greatest thing the depression did for us
was to get us back to fundamentals,
much in the same way that Paul’s fail-
ure at Athens caused him to come down
to earth and have a great success at
Corinth. He went on to say about these
fundamentals: “The N. R. A. is no more
than an application of Christian ideals
to business. The first code was written
by Moses on ten tablets of Stone at Mt.
Sinai, and the first code of fair compe-
tition was given by Christ, when He
said, ‘Do unto others as you would have
them do to you’”

He concluded with the statement,
“Simple faith in the power of the Master
to forgive sins is all that is needed in
this age,”

The meeting was closed by a prayer
by Mr. F. L.. Jackson,

Editor McPhail Announces Origi-
nal Joke Contest To Last
Until March 1

A sign more sure than a Scotchman
throwing his Christmas tree out the win-
dow that spring is in the offing will be
revealed March 15, with the appearance
of that 24-page compound of Howlarious
dynamite, The Yowl, otherwise known
as “The Davidson Phoney Papers.”

he has engaged CWA Project No. 1006A
to construct aisles all over the campus
for innocent readers to roll in.

In a last desperate effort to evoke
stray bits of humor from a sedate cam-
pus, McPhail announces an original joke
contest. Best joke gets a carton of Life
Savers. Any Davidson student may en-

ter any number of original jokes.

Howell Overton, humorous young
sophomore, has been clevated to the po-
sition of art editor following the failure
of Collier Ellis to return, Other changes
will feature exchange cartoons as well
as exchange jokes. It is hoped, but rather
doubtfully so, that some humorous light
poetry will appear.

Spring sports will be covered, sighed
Editor MePhail, evidently thinking of
swimming, and it is a matter of conjec-
ture whether anything humorous will be
printed. However, it is certain that sport
will NO'T be defined as a sudden jump
nor will baseball be termed a howl of a
vulgar order, and anyone who says golf
is an inlet or track is a low deception
will be thrown off the staff.

Gordon Wood will print under an as-
sumed name “Gertrude’s Steins on the
Table,” and Richard Vowles and Gibson
Smith are expected to bolster up the
short story section so as to give Wood's
story company in misery.

suspecting reporter that “Anyone who
