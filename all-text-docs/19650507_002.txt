Davidsonian Associate Editor

Editor Todd argues above that stu-
dents will “see through the illusions
painted by (Arnie Goodstein)” and
“closely examine the question around
which next week’s referendum is
based.” Where these illusions come
from. we don’t know. Todd says the
question is that of a “wet” or “dry”
campus, a point which Goodstein made
clear to the Student Council Monday
night when petitioning for a referen-
dum.

The direct effect of the passage of
next week's referendum would be a
“wet” campus. Neither Goodstein
nor anyone else denies this. But the
insinuation that a “wet” or “dry”
campus is the only question at stake
is the only illusion which we find.

Davidson presently prohibits the
consumption, and even possession, of
alcoholic beverages on campus. This
prohibition either denies that David-
son students can possess responsibili-
ties such as the ‘freedom to drink
without turning the dorms into houses
of rampaging drunks. or assumes that
any consumption of alcohol is inher-
ently evil and thus the college should
use the powers it holds over its stu-
dents to prevent them from succumb-
ing to this evil.

We assume that those favoring the
retention of the present rule are, for
the most part, adherents to the first
position mentioned above, that of the
fear of the misuse of privileges re-
sulting from repeal of the prohibi-
tion.

Such a fear is totally unwarranted.
It has been proven to be v7founded
in other schools where drinking is
permitted and there is little reason to
doubt that such would be the case
here. Students can now go up the road
and get drunk every night if they so
choose. There is no reason to believe

Issue Is Responsibility:
Will It Be Rejected’

anachronism of the present clause in
the student body constitution.

The issue at stake should be made
plain to the entire student body: it is
the question of a “wet” or “dry” cam-
pus.

Several polls and questionnaires
have been taken in recent years of
student opinion on the question of al-
cohol being allowed on or off the
campus; however, next week is the
first time that a formal vote will have
been taken on the status of the cur-
rent liquor clause in the constitution.

The most recent sampling of stu-
dent body opinion on the question
was taken last fall. Nearly two-thirds
of those questioned at that time op-
posed the student body regulation
prohibiting alcohol on campus. |

However, the same poll indicated
that approximately three-fourths of
the student ‘body opposed liquor in
the dormitories and nearly one-half
opposed liquor in fraternity houses.

During the last two weeks of school
with term papers, reviews and exami-
inations building pressure ahead, we
are prone for a change to lightly re-
gard many matters. This question can-
not afford anything less than the full-
est attention of every voter next week.

The most ideal solution is not nec-
essarily the most practical. We hope
that voters can see through the illu-
sions painted by some supporters of
repeal and can closely examine ' the
question around which next week’s
referendum is based.

that student freedom to change the
location of their drinking will bring
any appreciable increase in drunks
and drunkeness.

Student Council Vice-President
Johnny Gresham will present to the
Student Council Monday a resolution

‘that the Council promise a new for-

mulation of rules against disorderly
drunkeness and strict enforcement
of these rules if the drinking clause
is repealed. Such rules, with punish-
ments comparable to the infractions,
should quash any fears anyone might
have of excessses of drinking free-
dom.

Yet, we hardly think that such fears
are a real concern. The real concern
is whether Davidson will allow its stu-
dents the freedom to drink or not to
drink in their own rooms, whether
Davidson students think themselves
capable of accepting responsibilities
or whether they think of themselves
as so immature as to require pater-
nalistic regulations to steer them on
the straight and narrow.

Rejection of the petition is next
week’s referendum will mean a rejec-
tion of students’ willingness to accept
responsibility. It will be acceptance of
the fact that they should be governed
by outmoded restrictions.

If students cannot responsibly as-
sume the right to drink when they
choose, then they can hardly ask to
be granted freedom in more impor-
tant areas, such as the freedom to vol-
untarily find their own religion and
relation to God without forced attend-
ance at Davidson churches.

The faculty and trustees will close-
ly consider student feeling as express-
ed in the referendum. Refusal to erase
the outmoded drinking restriction in
the Student Body Constitution will be
an enormous setback for any future
attempts to liberalize student rights

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Plowden Protests Linking
Honor To Drinking Rule

Dear Editor:

There is no good reason why
thirty men out of the whole
student body should be honor-
bound to report violations of the
no - drinking - on - campus rule.
Whether you like or don’t like
the idea of a wet campus, you
can at least agree that it’s un-
fair to make one out of every
thirty students be on his honor
to report students drinking on
campus.

Making men honor-bound to
enforce college conduct regula-
tions is misusing the Honor
System. There are some ‘things
that are matters of a man’s hon-
or — drinking ain‘t one of them.
Lying, cheating and. stealing
are. One man’s drinking is not
a matter of another man’s hon-
or.
Considering that a majority of
the members of the Honor Court
and Student Council probably
drink off-campus, making them
say that drinking in one par:
ticular place (i.e. Davidson Col
lege) is a matter of their own
personal honor seems not a little
foolish. For that matter, hav.ng
a regulation designed to pzo-
hibit completely a pretty gener-
al social custom (81% of the stu-
dents here indulging) is kinda
silly.

The strength of the Honor
System is in its collective en-
forcement by the entire student
body. If whether or not a man
drinks on campus is such a
matter of honor as to have at
least a few men honor-bound to
report, why not have everybody
honor-bound to go looking for
alcoholics?

But the big problem is this —
a dry campus is something that
the college administration wants

Goodstein’s proposal does
not mask anything. It sim-
ply follows the only positive
course for changing the
drinking restrictions that is
open to students. A liberali-
zation in faculty regulations
will hardly precede stu-
dents’ changes in their own
regulations.

We have a chance to gain
some and express our desire
for the basic responsibilities
and freedoms which coin-
cide with any institution
which would aspire to allow
its students to develop free-
ly rather than to cast them
into rigid molds. Now is our
chance—let’s not blow it.

Both The Evening Star and
The Washington Post offered
favorable comment on the per-
formance.

Charles Crowder of The Wash-
Ingion Post wrote, ‘‘The Richey
work was the last on the pro-
gram but was far and above
the real success of the evening
in both performance and music-
al qualities . . . it is an award-
winning piece through and
through. .

“Richey makes it clear from
the beginning that he under-
stands what sounds a quartet
can make and of what effects,
virtuosity and thematic projec-
tion is capable.

“The know-how of manipula-
tion can be heard at every turn
but over that comes the sound
of a composer who is imagina-
tive, sensitive, and writes music
that is, quite simply, moving
and beautiful."

to have, but doesn’t want to
have to enforce. So it’s quite
convenient to have students hon-
or-bound to do the college’s
dirty work. A dry campus isn’t
necessarily something that the
students want; but a dry campus
is something that some of us
are honor-bound to enforce.

If the college administration
wants a dry campus, let them
do the enforcing — and not mis-
use the honor system. There's
no excuse for making one man
honor bound to enforce another
man’s conduct.

Dear Editor:

Alter scanning the editorial
page of last week’s DAVIDSON-
1AN to see what new insights
were being offered on the cur-
rent problems of D. C., I thought
a few comments might be justi-
fied. It seems that-perhaps the
new Editor-in-Chief doesn't have
the same style as his fireball-
ing predecessor.

As the current editor heaved
his latest blasts at Harrington’s
column and the Student Coun-
cil's statement, it appeared that
we now have on the mound what
is poetically described in base-
ball terms as a “‘Junkinan,”

After the editor had ridiculed
his editorial colleague for wast-
ing 1150 words in diatribe, he
then proceeded to slide in 500
words of his own concerning
council action. I believe that
his criticisms need some rebut-
tal.

The first of these criticisms
is that the council's statement
fails to come to grips with all
the details of the social ques-
tion. Upon reading the council's
statement one finds that the
council’s statement recognizes
the scope of the problem, but
has tried to limit its considera-
tion to one area — that of de-
layed rush and pledging. This
action is not a failure to meet
the problem but an attempt to
clarify views on one important
area of it.

Next a question of semantics
arises as the council is taken to
task for misconstruing the facul-
ty’s action on rushing and pledg-
ing. It seems that the terms
rushing and pledging are in
question here. He states that the
faculty action mentions delayed
pledging not delayed rush, and
that total elimination of rush
from the next school year is not
proposed in the wording of the
faculty report.

However, if one reads Article
1 of the faculty action, which
recommends that “. . . no mem-
ber of the class of 1969 may
pledge a national Greek letter
social fraternity during the
academic year 1965-66", and
Article 6, section d, which states
that, ‘‘. . . the Social Life Eval-
uating Committee is specifically
requested to present a recom-
mendation to the faculty by the
February meeting of 1966 with
regard to the wisdom of sopho-

more rush in 1966-67,"
meaning is evident.

While the cry of ‘“‘undue finan-
cial burden’? may be dramatic,
it is also factual in that the
council was informed that three
houses would be affected, at
least one of these seriously.
This information came from the
data of the Faculty Commit-
tee on Fraternities, Clubs, and
Social Life.

The editor then adds a touch
of levity as he reasons that there
is something unusual about
council action since the presi-
dent of.the council (not a vot-
ing member) endorsed the im-
mediate recommendations of the
Fraternity Evaluation Commit-
tee which do favor sophomore
rush.

Since this action was taken
before the new president assum-
ed the duties of his office, and
was‘an action previous to the
Faculty Committee’s report,
there seems to be no foundation
to this argument.

It seems almost ironic that,
te closes his editorial with an
admonishment that, ‘*. . . all
groups and parties examine
each idea in this matter close-
ly and impartially. Ignorance of
the facts, whether intentional
or not, can serve no good.” If
you're going to throw a curve,
Mr. Editor, don’t hang it on the
corner,

Dear Editor:

According to The Comparative
Gulde of American Colleges and
Universities, Davidson ranks in
the highly selective category, a
group whcih includes such out-
standing educational institutions
as Haverford, Duke, Stanford,
and thirty-five other well known
colleges and universities
throughout the country.

Of these thirty-eight, only five
require students to participate
in an ROTC program. These are
Cornell, Lehigh, Middlebury,
Worcester Polytechnic Institute,
and, of course, Davidson.

None of the institutions in the
very selective category, the
group which ranks above David-
son, including Amherst, Har-
vard, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology etc., requires its
students to enter an ROTC pro-
gram.

In North Carolina there are
only two colleges which require
ROTC: these are Davidson and
North Carolina A. and T.

Evidently, required ROTC is
not a mark of academic excel-
lence. Indeed, if it were, it
would seem to me as though
those schools which are consid-
ered to be truly outstanding
(e.g. Harvard and Amherst)
would require it of their stud-
ents. Also, let's hope that David-
son doesn't rank on the same
plane with North Carolina A.
and T.

Once More
With Feeling

By TIM KIMREY
Davidsonian Associate Editer

Editor's note: This is the first of a two-part column relat-
ing to the broad topic, Davidson College. This week's
article will be concerned with viewing the college as St is
today. Two weeks from today we wili attempt to define
the college as if could be sometime in the future.)

Davidson College is a dying institution. It is dy-
ing for many specific reasons: glaring weaknesses in
the fields of sociology, political science; narrow-
minded attitude of protecting the student body
through required religious exercises and prohibition
of liquor on the campus; a completely inadequate
library; a social caste system which thrives upon
stereotypes; and a large number of other short-
comings which come to our attention daily.

But Davidson College is dying for a much more
general reason: the powers that control the direction
of this college have refused and continue to refuse
to gear the college to the sweeping sociological and
intellectual changes that are stirring all around us.
The College has simply given itself to the past—the
past decades that have brought it recognition as one
of the outstanding small colleges in the South.

In the first place, being even the best of the

small colleges in the South does not place Davidson
in very outstanding company. The simple fact is that
there are no outstanding small colleges in the South.
In fact, the University of North Carolina is the only
school we would consider to be outstanding. Perhaps
Duke, Virginia and Vanderbilt deserve some con-
sideration. But Davidson does not come close to

any of these schools, the fact that it is a small college
notwithstanding.

CONTENT

Davidson College is simply content. It is content
producing well-rounded men and sending them back
to church and community. It is content to pamper
and protect young minds for four years. It is content
to stay in the safe middle-of-the-road, and yet re-
main aloof and isolated from the confusing and fast-
moving world around it. Worst of all, Davidson Col-
lege is content with its tradition.

I had the unfortunate task of writing to a Na-
tional Merit Scholar and outstanding basketball play-
er from Indiana this week about Davidson. I had
been asked by a friend to encourage him to come to
Davidson. It seems the boy wanted to be a minister.
I could only tell him that he would probably regret
ever coming to Davidson. Here he would encounter
ity. and o_o which stifles intellectualism, creativ-

, and social concern.
distrust which kills incentive and administrative pe,
ternalism which simply prevents growing up. Pa

LIBERAL ARTS

_ That boy would have found at Davi
thing but a good liberal-arts college. For one tiny,
there are too many pre-medical students here for
this to be a liberal-arts-college.

Two hundred and twenty members of
dent body are “pre-med,” involved in extremely nie.
orous courses of memorization and vomiting facts
on reviews. Such a method of learning has had a
damnable effect on the rest of the curriculum. These
two hundred and twenty are, for the most part, not
liberally educated, simply because they spend three-
fourths of their time grinding through chemistry
and biology courses and filling in the gaps with crip
courses in sociology, political science, geography
and certain Bible offerings. Not that they are the
only ones who waste their time dabbling in the abun-
gant of inane courses at this college; we are all

SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE

The boy from Indiana would have also
social atmosphere at Davidson Colege ante, defies
description. It is such a poor system that exclusive.
intellect-numbing fraternities are the main attrac-
tion. He would find a social life that centers around
three pitiful dance-weekends; weeks are long and

DIRECTION

The most sickening thing about Davidso
no one seems to know just where it is we are eoing.
much. less how or when we are going to get there.
The illustrious trustees showed their astounding ig-
norance and lack of direction during their weekend
holiday here last Friday. They couldn’t decide where
to go, so they set off in both directions by dropping
the faculty vow on the one hand and affirming the
importance of fraternities on the other. Trustee Pat-
terson didn’t even know fraternity men drank liquor
with young ladies, and a member of the Trustee
Committee on Religious and Social Life, which was
considering Pe fraternity question, hadn’t even
0 find out what th i
Committee’s report said! © Fraternity Bvaluation

ADMINISTRATION

. This wandering-around-in-the-fog is most clear-
ly seen at the top of the administrative pyramid of
the college. In most places, one of two men is looked
to for direction in eading a college: the president
and the dean of the faculty. These posts at David-
son are filled by Davidson graduates, men who were
educated in the Gentleman Tradition. They are men
who, while obviously hampered by problems of rais-
ing money and placating various factions among
trustees and alumni, are instructed to keep things

running smoothly and continue in the Davidson tra-

Until new leadership is found, or until the
genuinely fine men can be released from the atric.
tures of preserving tradition and conserving exist-
ing structures and attitudes, Davidson College will
continue to die a slow and painful death.
