Children of the malt, part II:
Sampling some more unusual American brews

By JOHN HUTCHINSON

This week’s guest drinkers
were Russell Snapp, assistant
professor of history, Julie Gib-
ert, visiting assistant professor
of history and Humanities,and
David Devereux, English his-
torian and Gibert’s spouse. ~

I extend many thanks to
them for their input. I also
thank Charles Houck, the
Domino’s Pizza Guy, who
wandered in off the streets and
joined us half-way through the
evening, and Michele Miller,
campaign communications
specialist in the College Rela-
tions office, who provided
moral support.

Aftera long discussion about
whether or not to use minuses
when grading the beers, my
guest drinkers and I got down
to business.

good party beer that is a little
on the weak side. Sweet after-
taste “like honey” -Snapp. “I
could see sitting ina tavernand
knocking this back and not
noticing it.” -Devereux.

Dixie Beer (New Orleans,
LA): Standard, main-line beer
with a little more body. Weak,
tinny aftertaste. “I like it less
the more I drink it” -Devereux
and Snapp. “Tastes like it was
cut with soda water” -Gibert.

Anchor Steam (San Fran-
cisco, CA): Heavy, acrid flavor
smoothed out by the aftertaste.
Would go well with heavier
food that is not too hot. “Good
beer to nurse along—definitely
not a toss-it-down kind of
beer” -Gibert.

Genesee 12 Horse Ale

tive, no aftertaste whatsoever,
no aesthetic qualities. Smells
vaguely like a skunk or “a Pat-
terson court party” -Gibert. “It
is drinkable. You could sit
around and get totally blasted
on this. It was meant to be con-
sumed in a large plastic cup.” -
Devereux.

Sun Valley (Helena, MT):
[This was Sun Valley’s special
winter beer]. Smells like Eng-
lish ale. A good food beer not
made for drinking in quantity.
Made to sip, not gulp. Rich,
smooth taste. “Wonderful
beer” -Snapp. “Good for a
drink and achat witha friend.”
-Gibert.

Mickey’s Big Mouth Malt
Liquor (LaCrosse, WI): The
smell makes you not want to
drink it. No aesthetic qualities.

“You can taste the sharpness of
alcohol” -Snapp. “Smells like
the really musty room in your
house that you don’t want to
open. I couldn’t drink any
more than two tablespoons
full.” -Gibert. “I’m upgrading
this from an “F’ toa~D-’ on the
off chance that there may be
something worse” -Devereux.

Anchor Liberty Ale (San
Francisco, CA): Taste begins as
grapefruit and resolves itself
into lead. Unpleasant, sweet
smell. “I think this really is
gross. Itis the °F’ I was thinking
of when I gave Mickey a *D-’” -
Devereux. “If you like beer that
tastes like grapefruit, buy this
beer” -Houck. “Tastes like a
beer that sat in a can for five
years” -Hutchinson. “Oh my
God. This is the beer that par-

ents should give to their chil-
dren when they are in 9th grade
so they will think that all beer is
bad” -Gibert.

August Schell Weiss (New
Ulm, MN): Tastes like wine
and smells like glue. “Grows
on you” -Devereux. “I
wouldn’t choose it, but it is
drinkable. I would go well with
cheese” -Snapp. “It would go
better with fruit loops” -
Houck. “If I want wine, I’m
going to pay for wine, not beer”
-Hutchinson.

August Schell Pilsner (New
Ulm, MN): Yeasty smell,
cloudy appearance. Descrip-
tions of taste range from
“smooth” to “sweet” to
“sharp.” As farasa good beer is
concerned, it is ordinary” -
Houck. “It tastes like bread,

We judged the quality 12
American brews over the eve-
ning. Another five, including
Lone Star and Samuel Adams,
remain refrigerated until the
group can reconvene.

To keep my guest drinkers
on their toes during the blind
tasting session, I: threw in
Mickey’s Big Mouth Malt Liq-
uor, the worst malt liquor I
could find. They were not
fooled.

Significant Comments:

Maui Lager(Wailuku Maui,
HI): Not heavily: carbonated
(note thatitis not pasteurized),
would go easily with food. A

(Rochester, NY): Not distinc-

and I think it needs butter” -
Gibert.

Augsburger Dark (Monroe,
WI): Nice smell. No body,
which is very disappointing,
given the dark color. Very ordi-
nary. Smoky, metallic taste.
“Tastes like someone tried to
convert a foundry into a brew-
ery” -Houck.

St. Stan’s Alt:. Amber
(Modesto, CA): Smells like
strawberry jello. Distinctive
taste is there, but it goes away
quickly. “Better than average
by a little bit. The taste doesn’t
grabme.It’stoo bubbly, almost
like champagne” -Snapp.

Anchor Steam Porter (San
Francisco, CA): Chocolatety
smell, tastes similar.

AsI came outof the7 p.m. show of
Driving Miss Daisy, I noticed a jam-
packed lobby with crowdsof people
streaming out the door. These 9 p.m.
theater-goers all had the same look
on their faces: “Is this movie worth
waiting in line for an hour?” The
answer to thatquestionisa rerounet
ing “YES.”

Driving Miss Daisy is set ina
wealthy suburb of Atlanta in the
1940s. “Miss Daisy” Werthan,
played by Jessica Tandy, is a Jewish
widow in her late sixties. She
emerges from her huge red-brick
home one summer morning and
accidentally drives her car over her
garden wall.

The accident turns the neighbor-

bors all turn out (complete with maids
serving lemonade) to gossip and specu-
late about Miss Daisy’s driving ability.

Miss Daisy’s son, Boolie, played by
Dan Ackroyd, decides to hire a chauf-
feur to do her driving. Thus begins a
battle royal between Hoke (Morgan
Freeman), a black chauffeur, and the
petulantand ever-stubborn Miss Daisy.

The gentle ways and common sense _

of Hoke gradually win over the tart-
tongued Daisy. The trust and sense of.
companionship thateventually springs
up between the two characters sustains
them through both good and bad times.
They both experience discrimination
due to their minority status, and this
provides an unspoken but common
bond between the two.

Hoke and Miss Daisy are also bound
together by the loss of Adela, Daisy’s

{Miss Daisy is really worth the drive into Charlotte

maid. When Adela dies unexpectedly,
both Hoke and Miss Daisy are con-
fronted with their own mortality.

The aging process then starts to di-
minish Miss Daisy’s mental capacities.
Hoke helps to bring Miss Daisy back to

reality, and he gives her the strength to .

continue her life. “Hoke,” she declares,
“you are my best friend.

Excellent supporting performances
are given by both Dan Ackroyd as
Boolie and Esther Rollins as Adela.
However, center stage belongs to Mor-
gan Freeman as Hoke and to Jessica
Tandy as Miss Daisy. The chemistry be-
tween the cantankerous Daisy and the
laid-back, optimistic Hoke is perfect.
Both Freeman and Tandy manage to
shinein their own roles without upstag-
ing each other in the least.

All of the actors and actresses in this

flected through small but important

~

film display credible Southern ac-
cents, and the Atlanta setting is ren-
dered to perfection.

The changing times which Hoke
and Miss Daisy live through are re-

details such as old advertisements,
vintage cars, newsreels and radio
PROGTAMIS-

All these little touches lend an au-
thentic flavor to the decades in
which the story is played out.

Driving Miss Daisy originally be-
gan as an off-Broadway play. The
play is still attracting large groups of
theater buffs in New York.

However, if you want to see the
stage version of the play a little closer
to home, Ovens Auditorium in
Charlotte still has tickets available
for its own production.
