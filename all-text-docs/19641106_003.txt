YMCA Drive Brings
Little Student Support

Student response to the YMCA
drive has not increased apprec-
iably despite the. continued ef-
forts of volunteer canvassers
and an editorial plea in last
week's DAVIDSONIAN.

As sporadic contributions con-
tinue to come in very slowly,
the YMCA projected need of
$3,000 looms larger every day.
According to YMCA Vice Presi-
dent Eric Nichols, ‘‘We current-
ly have about $2,100, plus what
little is still to be turned in by
various hall solicitors.”

Nichols, who is in charge of
the drive, cannot explain the
apparent indifference of the
students. “In past years.’’ he
added. ‘there were usually
more thari enough contributions.
But this year we're far behind.”

The only two dormitories that
have completed their YMCA
Drive are Duke and East, the
latter having: given more than
any other dorm. Trailing far be-
hind in the contribution race.
Richardson Dormitory is run-
ning a poor sixth out of six.

Since voluntary donations
from the student body are sup.
posed to provide at least $3,000
of the $4,425 necessary for the
coming year's budget, there re-
mains a need for $900 more. If
the budget is not met, the
YMCA will be forced to make
cutbacks in its program. This
would probably mean a smaller
number of speakers for ‘‘Great
Issues’’ and forums.

Even though the drive is over
four weeks old. the YMCA Cab
inet still has hope for more do
nations. The cabinet members
themselves are trying to solicit
the faculty and administration.
while the various hall solicitors
are being urged to renew their
canvassing from room to room.

Nichols reminds. all students
that any contributions, regard-
less of the amount. would cer
tainly help at this late date. He
points out. “Since the YMCA
concerns every student in some
way or another, any donation
would in effect benefit the dop-
or.’

Herbie Mann and his jazz
sextet will headline the upcom-
ing Interfraternity Council fall
concert next Saturday night,
November 14, at 8 p. m. in
Chambers Auditorium.

This year's Fall Function will
be ‘‘a novel departure from the

sad-eyed, doom-forecasting folk,

singers’’ aaccording to IFC
president Rick von Unwerth.

Mann is a well-known figure
on many college campuses
where he. performing with five
other musicians. has present-
ed his unique jazz style.

tet, high-lighted by Chief Bey,

who looks like a refugee from

Overseas Programs

By MIKE BATES

Davidsonian

Staff Writer

As U.S. colleges enrolled record numbers of students
this year, over 6.000 undergraduate students (mostly

juniors) chose to spend at

least a portion of a school

year at foreign universities in 60 nations around the
globe. This exodus swells by an. average of 14 pre cent
annually, about twice the growth rate of U. S. colleges.

What motivates these young
people? .Much more important
than simple wanderlust and a
youthful yen for freedom, pro-
fessors say, is the challenge
today’s students find in dealing
with new problems. unfamiliar
languages. and strange. cultures.

Of course, the specialized
European style of teaching is
different from the American.
Therefore. the student needs
special guidance of the kind
now provided in many U. S.-

Fraternity Discussions
To Be Held Next Week

The fraternity system and its
current situation at Davidson
College will be the subject of
a series of discussions next
week. Chapel programs on Mon-
day and Tuesday and an Open
End program on Wednesday
night will feature this topic.

Bob Young. assistant direc-
tor of admissions, will speak
at Monday's chapel. Young
stated that he will express his
personal concern of the situa-
tion.- not necessarily the con-
cern of the faculty and adminis-
tration. However. his views will
reflect the ideas of an increas-
ing number of the faculty. ad-

ministration and student body
who have talked with: him con-
cerning the present fraternity
set-up.

On Tuesday, Rick von Un.,-
werth, president of ‘the Inter-
fraternity Council, will address
the student body at chapel.
Von Unwerth will analyze the
points that Young makes as
well as the recurrent faculty
and administration criticisms
of the fraternity set-up.

In this analysis he will con-
sider the uniqueness of David-
son's system and the problems
inherent in such a system. He
will evalute the problems in

view of the. value of the David
son fraternity system and the
progress it has made.

On Wednesday evening at the
Union. an Open End program
will continue the discussion. It
‘is hoped by both Young and
von Unwerth that the programs
will not become a debate. but
rather a fruitful discussion.

These programs are not an
official action by the adminis-
tration system as it now
stands. Rather. the purpose is
to got the current fraternity

situation in the open, and to.

get people talking and -discus-
sing the problems involved.

Student Lab Assistants
Relieve Biology Staff

By HEYWARD CARTER
Davidsonian Feature Writer
In a school as traditionally

stalic as Davidson, any reaction
acy move ‘is usually greeted
with surprise and wonder.
Going backwards is just not the
thing to do among the forward
looking ‘members of the student
body (or even among the. status-
quo boys), and when such a
step is taken by the ultra-libe-
[ral faculty, such extremism is
indeed to be marvelled at.

But Davidson has revived a
practice of the past and fs. this
year, making full use of it. The
practice is the policy of hav-
ing student laboratory assistanis

in the primary lab sciences.
This had not: been doné for. at
least thirty fiye years, until the
beginning of this: session, but
now that it has been ro-institut-
ed it seems to. be on ils way to
becoming a permanent fixture.

The students who have been
chosen for these positions in
clude Roger David. Dan Broad-
head. Barney’ Lewis. David

Pfohl,. Mac. Mayes. Vernon An-
derson. and Tommy Heffner.
All are members of the Senior
Class.

Briefly, the purpose of a
laboratory . assistant is to re
lease the professor from hours
of time-consunting aid in the
laboratory where he is scarcely
more than a supervisor. and to
enable more of his classes to

meet at the same time, For
| each of the professor's uwo labs
there is one assistant, thus

making the professor a sort of
“straw boss” who wanders be-
tween labs. answering . ques-
tions. or who hardly need ap

The office of DAVID-
SONIAN Managing Editor,
capably filled this year by
Michael L. Harrington, af-
fords a campus soapbox
from which one may speak
to vital issues and inflame
current opinion. Not one
to let such power go beg-
ging, Harrington has re-
cently focused his attention
on the national election.

Asa prognosticator he en-
joyed some success in his final
prediction of the election out-
come. “Goldwater - Miller. will
get’ about 40 per cent of the
popular vote and will carry
only seven States with 49 elec-
toral votes." mused Harring-
ton and the Christian - Science
Monltor on October 30.

TOTALS CORRECT

Those figures proved reason-
ably accurate; the Arizona Sena-
tor actually won in six states

with combined electoral vote
of 52. Of course. Florida. Wy-
oming and Nebraska failed to
take note that Harrington had
placed them in the GOP column
and all three went to Johnson
by slight margins.

Unfortunately the Managing
Editor's errors of omission were
not so easily explained. The
margin of Goldwater victory in
South Carolina and Georgia
far outstripped Harrington’s
fertile imagination, he placing
both states In the LBJ corral.

Only by tracing Harrington’s
predictions through the weeks
can the full extent of his pow-
ers be appreciated. On October
9, the hopeful young journalist
injected hope into the local GOP
contingent with three rather re:
markable forecasts.

On that date THE DAVID-
SONIAN carried the news that
Senator Keating was winning in
New York. Fortunately (or un-
fortunately—depending on view-
point), Mr. Kennedy overcame

this deficit and carried the
State by 800,000.

TERROR IN NEW ENGLAND

In Vermont and Maine, terror
gripped the collective Democra-
tic heart as Harrington an-
nounced the presidential race
even in those two states. The
final results gave Johnson a
2-1 margin in both states, and
no doubt many irate New Eng-
landers cancelled their subscrip-
tions.

The week of October 16, was
a bad one for the Managing
Editor. Not only did he an:
nounce Goldwater ahead and
gaining in Tennessee, he went
on to include the state twice
in his forecast for the week
(fortunately he said the same
thing both times). It ‘is anti-
climatic to note that Johnson
carried the state by 100.000 out
of one million votes cast.

“Ohio is a toss-up — watch
Illinois for changing tide (to
Goldwater)."" Johnson carried

both States rather handily and
it is to be hoped that few man-
hours were lost watching for
Harrington's “tide that wasn’t.”

Harrington went on to call
Oklahoma “‘undecided"’. to say
that Goldwater was ‘‘closing the
gap” in Missouri, and to award

Nebraska to the Arizona Sena-
tor. It is to be assumed that
both Senator Goldwater and
Michael L. Harrington would
prefer to forget such opti-
mism .. . and as noted before.
it was a bad week.

TOUGH BATTLE

To top off that week's ill-
advised remarks, Harrington
fought a tough battle with poli-
tical reality -in Indiana. In
awarding the state to Gold-
water. Mike noted, “If Repub-
licans don't carry this state.
they won't carry a single one.”’
Johnson’s comfortable margin
silences further comment.

In contrast the following week

was a relatively good one for
the Managing Editor. He now
rated Wyoming a “toss up"’ and
gave Idaho to Goldwater but.
others who might have known
better did likewise.

That brought. Harrington to
his final week’s predictions
mentioned earlier. Worthy of
note. the last national break-
down left. out Tennessee—only
fair considering the state had
been omitted two weeks earlier.
Also. Harrington insisted that
Alabama's unpledged electors

would vote for Goldwater—an
action forbidden by State law.

As Mike Harrington must
have sensed, American politics
can make fools of the most
learned of authorities. Indeed.
Harrington did better than many
other local ‘‘authoritics’ and
seemed to improve tremendous-
ly as the election approached.

preventing chaos and answer-

the applicants by reason of his
ability in the course when he
took it. and he must combine the
talents of teacher, monitor and

there are seven lab assistants,
six of whom are helping with
freshman biology, and one who
assists with comparative ana-
tomy.

PUCKETT COMMENTS

Dr. W. Olin Puckett. who
summed up the general opinion
of the faculty on the subject,
said. “It is certainly nat. the
best teaching in the world,”
but. admits that it takes a load
off the professor, while giving
the students as good instruction
as is needed for the laboratory.
“After all,” he says, “it is a
menial job for a teacher. so
it's hard {6 get.someone good."
Therefore students must suf-
fice.

Interestingly enough, Puckett
was himself a sort of lab. as-
sistant while at Davidson, for
hired by Prof. Martin for a
year to help out ‘in the labora-
tories. This. so Interested Puck-
elt in teaching that he gave up
‘his. ambitions in medicine and
turned to professional teach
ing.

The attitude among the stud-
ent assistants themselves is
generally that ‘it is a ‘good
deal.’ It takes only about seven
or eight hours a week. pays
| fairly well, and gives good
teaching experience. (Only one
of these boys will go on in teach
ing the rest will go to medi-
cal ‘school but they claim
it is still-a valuable experience.)

Sixty-five high school seniors have been notified of
their acceptance to the Class of 1969 on the Early De-
cision Plan, H. Edmunds White, associate director of

week.

the verbal section and 653 on

the mathematics. This figure

approximately equals that of

the freshman class.
DE-EMPHASIZES SAT

White, however. cautions
against putting too much faith
in these scores. He explained,
“We ordinarily play down these
scores because they are far
from the most important aspect
of admissions.”

“Also.” he continued. “‘any-
one interpreting these scores
should remember that they are
junior year scores and would
probably average thirty to
forty points beiter on the sec-
ond try during their senior
year.”

SAME AS OTHERS

In other aspects. this group
seems to be on about the same
level as previous Early Decis-
ion groups. The present fresh.
man class had sixty-eight ac-
ceptances. as opposed to sixty-
five for the Class of ‘69.

The quality of the high school
records of these future fresh-
men are generally comparable
with earlier groups: however.
no statistics are available on
this aspect.

Says White, ‘I don’t want to
give the impression that : this
group isn’t good. but I get tired
of hearing people saying every
year, ‘Theyre great!’ All the
classes here are good, and I
hesitate to single out any one
particular group.”’

NON- SOUTHERNERS

White was especially pleased
that this class is continuing
the trend toward greater geo-
graphical distribution which has
been noticeable in the past seve-
ral years. Of the sixtytfive
members of the group. thirteen
boys are from outside the
South.

An interesting note is that
there are five boys from Penn-
sylvania, as compared. to only
four in the entire Class of ‘68.
