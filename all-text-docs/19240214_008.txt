CHARLOTTE N. C. | Florida Game |
| In a slow, ragged game the Davidson |

| Wildcats defeated the University of Florida, |
| Wednesday, 34 to’ 22. The Jacksonville |
|paper had made a statement earlier in the |
| week that Davidson was the only place at |
which the ‘Gaters expected to register a win,
but they evidently counted the score before |
it was made.
| The University carried two All-Southern
football men with them, but football reps do |
jnot make basketball players. Fouls were |
| frequent, and the game was rough. Six |
|fouls were called on the Wildcats and eight |
on the 'Gaters.

In the first half the score ended 15 to 11,!
lovith Davidson on the upper end of the score. |
| Staley did some pretty work in this half, |
| looping three field goals and two foul throws. |

Lenoir Game

In a game that was throughout character-
ized by poor playing on both sides, Davidson
won over Lenoir by superior shooting and
came out with the long end of a 34-21 score.
The outcome was never much in doubt, but
Davidson missed many a chance to roll up
a smashing score.

The game was slow throughout, and there
were many fouls. The defense of both
teams was especially weak at times, and the
fouls were the results of efforts to bolster

N. C. State Game

Playing a flashy brand of basketball, bril-
liant in most respects, and only slightly
ragged at times, the Wildcat quintet turned
the N.C, State defenders back by the score
of 24 to 13, in a contest staged at the gym
last Monday night. ‘The game was fast, and
a good exhibition of the caging art. State
was expected to put up a stiffer battle, due
to strengthening since the first of the sea-
son, but they failed in the attempts at long
shots.

Boggs, R. De

for

State caged the first point on a foul and
the score was 4 to 0 before the Wildcats
sent their first point through the mesh. It
was a long shot from the floor by Staley,
who was without a doubt the star of the
game. During this half Staley was able
to send the inflated sphere through the bas-
ket twice mote from long distances, while
his colleagues added three points. The score
of the first half ended 9 to 4 in favor of
Davidson, the Techmen being unable to add
to the first points made early in the game.

In the second half, State displayed a
flashy streak, and in a few minutes were
neck and neck with the Wildcats, and one
point ahead. Then the Wildcats became
rampant and began rolling up their points,
the effective work of the guards preventing
State making more than two more count-
Staley caged four field goals in this
half, all from short distances, bringing his
total counters of the game to 14, one point
more than State made for the entire fracas.

and held him the remainder of the period for
a win on time.

Matheson, Carolina's 125-pound man, ex-

dered an exhibition of his usual brand of |

hibiting a superior brand of wrestling, forced

a fall from P. N. Patterson, but only after
six minutes and 40 seconds of fast work.

The 145-pound men, Waters, of Carolina,
and Houck, of Davidson, wrestled the full
10 minutes to a draw. Houck secured time

‘advantage of two minutes and 20 seconds,

but Waters succeeded in drawing the match
by technicality.

In the 160-pound class the situation was
reversed and Waters, of Carolina, secured a
two-minute and 20 second advantage over
N. G. Patterson, of Davidson.

The two heavyweight classes, in both of ©
which Poindexter, of Carolina, and Linda-

mood, of Davidson, were opponents, called

forth the most intense excitement of the
whole meet. Lindamood had only to win
one match to secure the victory for David-
son, while Poindexter had only to draw both
matches to clinch it for Carolina.

In the first match the whole 10 minutes
passed without cither wrestler being forced
to the mat. In the second, Lindamood suc-
ceeded in forcing Poindexter to the mat, but
was unable to hold him for time and the
match ended in a draw. The
