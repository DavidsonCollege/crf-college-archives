The Wildcat Pulse

Lacrosse wins first
game, beats Limestone

By ANNA STRINGFIELD
Staff Writer

The Wildcat women’s lacrosse team start-
ed its spring season last Wednesday with a
16-11 victory over Limestone but could not
carry this momentum into its Sunday contest
against Loyola (Md.), losing 20-9.

Pressure from the onset of Wednesday’s
game helped the Wildcats secure their open-
ing day win against Limestone. Jen
Crawford 710 set the tone for the Wildcats,
scoring a game-high five goals. To add to the
scoring frenzy, both Emily Diefendorf ’08
and Haley Cook ’10 contributed three goals
apiece to lead the Wildcats to victory. Other
scorers for Davidson included Emily Palmer
°08 and Callie Seymour ’09. On the defen-
sive side, Laura Johnson ’08 played impres-
sively in between the posts, boasting a game-
high 15 saves. The team’s all around per-
formance thus proved excellent.

“What a great way to start the season and
to carry the momentum from last year’s solid
finish into this season,” coach Betsy
Economou said. “T was very pleased with our
transition game today and very impressed
with our team’s composure when Limestone
started to come back late in the second half.
We never lost our focus and finished out the
game strong.”

Only four days later, the Wildcats returned
to the field for their first home game of the
season against Loyola. In the first meeting
between the two schools, Loyola came out
on top with a 20-9 decision over Davidson.

Diefendorf and Cook led the Wildcats with
three goals apiece. Crawford tallied another
two goals for the team, while Claire O’Shea
’09 added one goal for the Wildcats. On the
defensive side, goalkeepers Johnson and
Michelle Pav ’10 combined for a total of 11
saves for Davidson.

Some positives could be seen in the tough
loss. Even though Loyola won in the shots
category 40-21, Davidson led in ground-
shots, 16-15. Also, consistent pressure from
the Wildcats led to 13 Loyola turnovers;
unfortunately, these small victories could not
overcome Loyola.

The lacrosse team will take to the field
again at 1 p.m. on Feb. 23 against American.

Trebor Clavette ’08 won matches versus both Campbell and Anderson Saturday.

Wrestling drops away
meet at The Citadel

By KevIN BIRNEY
Staff Writer

Davidson wrestling came up with two big
wins this past Saturday night, taking down
Campbell and Anderson at Belk Arena.
Trebor Clavette °08, Sam O’Hair ’09, and
Ben Altman °10 all won two matches
apiece, leading the way in the 26-19 deci-
sion against Campbell and a 26-15 victory
over Anderson.

Things started off well for the ’Cats in the
opener against the Fighting Camels when
Altman earned a technical fall in the first
period of his match. Already, Davidson had
a 5-0 lead. Campbell won the next match,
but two Campbell forfeits increased
Davidson’s lead to 17-3. The Fighting
Camels came back, however, and through
six matches the score read 17-10.

Clavette responded with a technical fall
victory. He almost pinned his opponent in
the first round and had a few impressive
throws before piling up enough points in the
second round to secure the win. O’ Hair fol-
lowed with a major decision, sealing the
victory for the ’Cats.

The team, however, did not have much
time to savor the win. A few minutes later,
the Wildcats had to line up against
Anderson in the second half of the double-
header. Once again, Altman started the
match off well with a technical fall. The
Radsky twins followed with two more wins,
Alex ’11 at 133 and Vitaly ’11 at 141. After
these wins, the ’Cats led by an impressive
11-0 advantage.

Anderson answered with three straight
wins, which put the bad guys back within
striking distance and shrunk Davidson’s
lead to 11-9. Clavette stopped the bleeding
with a 10-0 decision, and O’Hair made it
two in a row with a 17-2 technical fall. The
teams then exchanged forfeits, cementing
the final score at 26-15 for the home team.
After tough losses in previous matches, the
’Cats did not give ground in their two home
matches.

“We got two much-needed wins,” O’ Hair
said. “We did what we were supposed to do.
We have one more match at home, and we
expect to get our third win in a row to carry
us into the Southern Conference tourna-
ment.”

Up next for the "Cats is a home match
against Duquesne on Friday. It will be the
last test before the season’s summit, the
SoCon tournament.
