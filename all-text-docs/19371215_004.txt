“If my boy was an outstanding
football player I wouldn't let him
go to Davidson where, under the
policy of little or no subsidizing, he
probably would be the lone target
for opposing teams to spot and to
gang up on.

I wouldn't want him to carry so
large a part of the burden as has
Lafferty, and probably leave the
school crippled and worn.

Davidson owes it to Lafferty and
Wingfield and Davis and such like
to protect them and to offer them
support — despite Joe Johnston's
nauseating statement that Lafferty
is crippled because of what he did
to Duke and not because of what

Duke did to Lafferty.
