Ann Harriott Fisher and Chris Tuttle are fired
up. The newly elected president and vice presi-

dent of the SGA (respec-
tively) are optimistic about
the school’s future and the
unfolding era of student gov-
ernment.

Their combined student
government experience un-
der both Warren Buford and
Buster Burk has taught Fisher
and Tuttle volumes about the
organization, and they are
undoubtedly prepared to take
it to a new level.

Since her freshman
year when “Warren and Bill
came walking down the hall”
recruiting bright young
freshmen to join the SGA,
Fisher has been involved.
She began as a freshman
senator under Bill Gullan’s
administration. Then she
won the sophomore class
presidential election and
worked under Warren
Buford’s administration.

Fisher was elected vice
president of the SGA her jun-

ior year and has worked with Buster Burk in the

latest chapter of SGA administration.

At the end of his freshman year, Tuttle was
urged by friends to support the independent cause
in student government. So, on more of a whim
than anything, he ran for the sophomore indepen-

dent senator posiften and won.

Realizing the excitement and visible progress
that student government provides, Tuttle has con-

Tuttle said that some unnecessary qualities
exist in committees that are in the bylaws. Some
of these committees have chairpersons, but they
might not actually meet the needs of the SGA —
or ever meet as a group, for that matter. Essen-
tially, Fisher and Tuttle would like to tighten and
strengthen the governing body, even meeting all
the requirements of the extensive SGA bylaws.

also want to improve fac-

istrative relations by balanc-
ing the involvement of each
group on different commit-
tees. Fisher said that stu-
dents sit on both trustee and
faculty committees, but that
there is a glaring lack of fac-
ulty on SGA committees.

Communication
between the respective
groups is the first step, ac-
cording to Tuttle and Fisher,
that will be taken to improve
relations. “We have such an

Tuttle, who pointed out po-

As the SGA, faculty, and administration gel,
Fisher and Tuttle would like to branch out from the
Davidson core and improve town-gown relations.

know and care about the recent tragedy,” said
Fisher, and both Fisher and Tuttle want the student
government and the school to help the community

Burk addresses college community

Outgoing student body president
Buster Burk delivered his State of the
School Address Tuesday night, urging
students to take some personal initia-
tive in creating Davidson today while
crafting its tomorrow.

 Acrowd of approximately 30 stu-
dents and administrators gathered in

the Morrison Room, as Burk — clad in .

a red and black bow tie and suit, “his
Davidson suit,” as he called it — gave
the first such speech in recent memory.

“We’re rising higher and higher,”

he said of Davidson. “Itjust takes some »

Burk’s 20-minute talk:

anytime soon.”

and things to come: “The issue of hav- °

ing an equal (to the fraternity system)
for women will not fall to the wayside.”

On the Honor Code and Council,
which tried three times the average
amount of cases last semester: “The
Honor Code needs to have a more pub-
lic presence oncampus. Students should
know about the Code and trials — when
they happen and what the verdicts are.”

student body: “Admissions is trying to
do all it can to get rid of the financial aid

of Davidson’s counterparts: “We have
to think about what we’ re spending and
where we’re spending now more than
any other time.”

On that note, he announced an
open forum with the Priorities Planning

The PPG, which has been meeting
for roughly a year now, examines what
Davidson wants to be — or should be—

Burk invited any and all students
to attend the meeting and voice their
opinions on “what they think Davidson
should be — how it should stay the
same and how it should change.”

Burk’s newly elected successor, Ann
Harriot Fisher, “It was very confident.
It kind of epitomized Buster’s term.”

“Tt was one more testimony that
students around here think more broadly
than what classes they have and what
they’re eating,” Vagt said at the infor-
mal reception following Burk’s speech.
“The (SGA) President offers thoughts
on the College and gives a challenge. I
think it’s great.”

The SGA met for the last time
under Burk Tuesday night and presented
him with a chair, a gift traditionally
given to SGA presidents at their last
meeting.

“He deserved it,” Haselden said.
“He served the school as a class presi-
dent, student body president, and hall
counselor.”

“TItwas Buster’s day today,” Fisher
said.

To learn stronger leadership
skills, students at Davidson can enroll
in the Emerging Leader Program.

Open to all first- and second-year
students, an in-depth overview of the
program will be presented tomorrow
at 5:00 p.m. in the Union. Program
requirements and attendance policy
will be among topics discussed.

Depending on the amount of in-
terest, students will be divided into
two groups, each with a ceiling of 25.
Groups will meetevery Wednesday or
Thursday from 7:00-8:30 p.m. for six
weeks. :

Each weekly leadership lab ses-
sion will cover a different topic and
will feature speakers such as Dean of
Students Tom Shandley, Sherry
Muloholland, and Emerging Leader
co-coordinators Ernest Jeffries and
Dee Jordan, Assistant Dean of Stu-
dents and Director of Minority Stu-
dent Affairs, and Assistant Director of
Residence Life, respectively.

Topics that will be discussed in-
clude time management, communica-
tion skills, diversity, stress manage-
ment, group dynamics, and conflict
resolution.

In its pilot year, the Emerging
Leader Program accounts for one of
the three Comprehensive Leadership
Programs created in response to
Davidson’s recently awarded Duke
Endowment. (The other two programs
are Leadership Davidson and Student
Leadership Retreat.)

According to Jordan, the Emerg-
ing Leader Program offers a “great
opportunity for students who don’t

have a lot of traditional leadership
experience.” y

Jeffries agreed, saying that the
program specifically targets “those stu-
dents who don’t necessarily consider
themselves leaders.”

Designed to teach basic leader-
ship skills-and principles, the program
will serve as a “building block,” and
moreover, a “foundation to move for-
ward,” said Jordan.

She went on to say that the prin-
ciples and topics taught will apply to
life skills in addition to those needed
“just to be a student here at Davidson.”

Jeffries added that the program |
will “hone some of those skills impor-
tant to functioning in the community.”

One of the program’s require-
ments concentrates on this last aspect,
community.

Tenhours of service must be com-
pleted on campus or in the Davidson
area as part of the program’s curricu-
lum, stressing the importance of lead-
ership in the community.

The program also consists of a
mentor component. Upperclassmen
nominated by the Davidson staff and
faculty will be-paired with each par-
ticipant in the Emerging Leader Pro-
gram. ;

Another aspect of the program
requires students to keep a reflective
journal, which will include what the
student learned at each lab session and
how they feel that information could
be applied in a leadership position.

According to Jeffries, the jour-
nals will “try to point out how (the
students) changed during the experi-
ence, and also give (the coordinators)
an indication” of the program’s effec-
tiveness.
