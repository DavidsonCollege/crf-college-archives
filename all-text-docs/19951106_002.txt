Celebrating the old Union, awaiting the new

By Sarau. TEACHWORTH

Though it may have gone un-
noticed by most Davidson students,
the Grey College Union turned
twenty years old this fall. Ironi-
cally, it’s birthday party was also
the setting for the unveiling of the
feasibility study for a new Union
in Johnston Gym.

Tocelebrate the Union’ s birth-
day, the Union Board, led by presi-
dent Morgan Perry, threw a party
last Monday, complete with deco-
rations, cake, and ice cream. The
organizers displayed relics from
Union activities of the past, such as
t-shirts, photographs, and contracts
with visiting bands, around the 900
Room.

Union Director William
Brown was quite excited about the
event. Noting the importance of
the Union to the student body, he
said, “We ought to celebrate the
Union every year.”

After being introduced by
Perry, Brown was the first speaker
of the evening. He began by speak-
ing about the importance of col-

lege unions in general. “A union
needs to be a place where, if you
come into, oreven come close toit,
you feel welcome,” he said.

He went on to describe what
the plans were for our present col-
lege union twenty years ago. At
the time, many people wanted to
have post office boxes in the Union.

This way, students would see
each other at the Union every day
and would be more likely to stay
and participate in other activities
or even just lounge around for a
while. However, because of suffi-
cient opposition, it was decided
not to deliver mail to the Union.

The bar in the 900 Room was
also a prominent social facility,
especially since the drinking age
was eighteen. With the change in
drinking age, though, students had
one less reason to come to the
Union. Also, there were some who
wanted the main food service fa-
cility to be joined to the building.
Because this plan fell through, stu-
dents continue to spend their meal-
times eating far away from the
Union.

Accounts of U.N.
Women’s Conference
offer hope for change

“In Chinese they call a daugh-
ter a ‘female son’,” noted Mary
Dawn Bailey, one of three speak-
ers at Thursday night’s presenta-
tion on the Fourth World Confer-
ence on Women.

Sponsored by the Dean Rusk
Program and part of Global
Women’s Awareness Week,
Thursday’s program, titled “Be-
yond Beijing”, featured three pan-
elists who had attended the Fourth
World Conference in Beijing,
China, in September.

Bailey, a writer for The Char-
lotte Observer, June Kimmel, Re-
gional Director of the North Caro-
lina Council For Women, and
Letitia Campbell, a senior at

Davidson, who travelled to Beijing

with the Presbyterian Church and
a grant from the Dean Rusk Pro-
gram, shared their recent experi-
ences and insights concerning the
conference.

Bailey began the presentation
with a slide show introduction to
the U. N. conference. While her
audience viewed ‘slides of the
conference’ s opening ceremonies,
famous attendees, and local activi-
ties, Bailey offered a brief history
of previous U. N. Women’s Con-
ferences, the first of which, held in
Mexico City twenty years ago,
drew 3,000 attendees.

Incontrast, Bailey pointed out
that Beijing’ s conference this Sep-
tember boasted an attendance of
approximately 30,000 people.

Describing the atmosphere of
determination and energy which
marked the conference, Bailey re-
counted several of the 300 work-
shops held each day in Beijing and
its neighboring city Huairou.

Campbell spoke next, focus-
ing on the role of young people at
the conference. Citing a statistic
that 50 percent of the world’s popu-
lation is currently under the age of
twenty-five, Campbell stressed her
belief that the world’s youth have
an immense responsibility and op-
portunity to change the lives of
many women all over the world.

Along with seventy other
young observers to the conference,
Campbell worked with a Youth
Caucus in the development of its
own document. Approximately
“ten percent of the conference at-
‘tendees were under the age of
thirty,” cited Campbell. “‘No other
U.N. conference has had so much
youth involvement.”

Concluding the panelists’ pre-
sentation, June Kimmel described
her interactions with the
Conference’ s international attend-
ees, most of whom, she said, “know
a lot more about [Americans] than
we know about them.”

She was asked more than once
by interested women from coun-
tries around the world when she
thought Hillary Clinton would run
for president.

Kimmel also discussed the
tension and conflict that arise
when a young organization like
the U. N. demands social changes
of anation with as long a history as
China, which, she noted, “was
building the Great Wall in 200
b.c.”

However, the panelists agreed
that their experiences at the U.N.’s
Fourth World Conference on
Women provided encouraging evi-
dence of the world’s realization
that, as Kimmel explained, “if you
don’t let [women] ’be a part of the
decision making process, you’ve
lost half the brains.”

important functions, the Union lost
much of the importance it was in-
tended to have. The construction
of dorms down the hill and of the
Senior Apartments aggravated the
problem by shifting the center of
campus activity away from the
Union.

One of the main problems
Brown sees with the present Union
is that there aren’t enough offices
for student organizations. The
building was constructed as a li-
brary, not as a meeting place. Asa
result, many organizational offices
are too small and not easily acces-
sible.

For these reasons, there has
been talk for years.of creating a
new Union. The idea was first
proposed back in 1985. The
amount of interest has fluctuated
over time.

Last summer, astudy was done
to see where the “heartbeat” of the
campus was. The answer was Duke
dormitory. This news was excit-
ing because Johnston Gym sits right
beside it.

Little and Associates was hired

old gym could be converted into a
Union which would provide for
the needs of the school. They said
it could be easily done.

After Brown’s speech, Dean
Shandley gave a brief explanation
of the procedure of the feasibility
study. He then unveiled Little and
Associates’ plan for a new Union.

According to the plans, the
Union would have to be three sto-
ries. Init would be adequate space
for all of the student organizations
currently in the Union as well as
more.

Among other things, there
would be a two-story cafe with
outdoor seating available, the book-
store, aticket office, two elevators,
a game room, exercise facilities,
and the laundry. Davidson Out-
doors would stay in basically the
same place it now occupies.

They would also build on to
Johnston Gym to add an outdoor
amphitheater on the side facing
Duke and a theater with a capacity
of 800 on the other side. Accord-
ing to the plans; there would be
enough room to put post office
boxes in if the post office requests

Davidson to move out or if there is
interest in having the boxes on
campus.

While these plans are excit-
ing, Shandley cautioned that a new
Union is not going to spring up
overnight. The school’s first fi-
nancial priority is a new life sci-
ences facility.

Until that project is underway,
fundraising for the Union cannot
begin. Also, the ideas Little and
Associates came up with are in no
way carved in stone. Chances are
that various changes will be made
in the next few years.

Shandley said that the school °
will probably have a design com-
petition before selecting an archi-
tect. There will also be planning
forums so students, faculty, and
staff can contribute their ideas.

The process is going to be
long. Brown admitted that it would
take a miracle for any current stu-
dent to see a new Union during
their Davidson career.

The future use of the Grey
College Union is still dubious.
Shandley says only, “Ithasn’t been
determined.”
