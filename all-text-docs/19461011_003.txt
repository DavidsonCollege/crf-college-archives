N. C. STATE
As a_ stepping stone in the test of strength, Saturday
night’s game with Wofford proved encouraging, but the real
test comes Saturday when the Cats meet N. C. State. State’s
strong Wolf pack, thus far, has lived up to its name, gang-
ing upon Clemson for a 14-7 victory. Led by Howard Turner,
All-Southern tailback from Rocky Mount, N. C., who scored
both T. D.’s for State, the Wolfpack netted 99 yards running
to Clemson’s 76. If the Wildcats can stop Turner and glue-
fingered end Oscar Boseman they may leave State singing
the blues.

CARDS-SOX

The highly. favored Boston Red Sox took the first
game of the Worlds Series.3-2 Sunday, but lost to the
Cards, 3-0 in the second game Monday, Sunday's game
turned into a thriller. Tied up at the end of the ninth,
2-2, Williams fouled out. With the count two balls and
no strikes York connected with a fast pitch and sent it
deep into the left field bleachers for a home run to give
the Red Sox the 3-2 win.

FOOTBALL IN THE CAROLINAS

Football over the week-end was varied. North Carolina beat
a strong Miami team 21-0; Wake Forest knocked over
Georgetown 19-6, while Duke lost 12-7 to Tennessee, and
South Carolina dropped a 14-6 contest to Alabama.

Speaking of football in the Carolina and in’ the Southern
Conference. particularly, I would like to put ina few words
concerning the Big Five of the Conference, of which David-
son is one. During the war when Davidson’s teams sagged
in strength - and finally..wilted out altogether, spectators
ceased to think of Davidson as anything to worry about. This
year, however, with the Cats back-in strength and power, we
are again taking place as a charter member of the Big
Five, Duke, Wake Forest, State, Carolina and Davidson.

‘SIDELIGHTS
In rolling over V.M.I. 32-6 Georgia Tech actually
played the football flat. A swarm of Tech players poured
in on Bob Thomason, V.M.I. halfback, and’ blocked his
punt in the fourth quarter.
When the referee unstacked the resulting pileup he tossed
the ball off the field. It was as flat as the proverbial pancake.

Lees McRae

In an afternoon game Friday the
Davidson Wildkittens defeated
Lees-McRae Junior College on
Richardson Field by an impressive
score of 37-0. Although Lees-Mc-
Rae did not offer strong resistance,
the Davidsonians showed a good
bit of promise. The vigorous of-
fensive sparked by the running of
Buck Troutman, Dave Erwin, W. G.
Ewart and Bob Walker completely
took the boys from Lees-McRae
who never neared the pay dirt area
but twice. This happened once
when a Davidson pass interference
penalty gave them the ball on the
eight, and once again when they
recovered a Davidson fumble on
the Davidson 21 yard line.

Kittens Show Strength

The Kittens unleashed a tricky
set of reverses that kept Lees-
McRae baffled, and kept them in
the pay dirt most of the time.

Lineman of the week was a sub-
stitute end, T. T.. Kirk, who kept
the stands cheering with his out-
standing play. However all the
Kitten linemen played a good game,
showing some fine blocking and
causing the visitors to have to take
to the air for most of their gains.

whole of his squad.

Start Slowly

Davidson kicked off to start the
things rolling, and Lees-McRae
brought the ball back to their own
thirty. After failing to make a
first down, the visitors kicked, but
then recovered the ball on a David-
son fumble. After gaining six
yards, Davidson in’ turn recovered
a fumble, but was forced to punt
from their .own forty-eight. After
another punt by Lees-McRae, the
Kittens engineered a drive led by
Troutman from his own forty-eight,
which ended with first tally for
Davidson. Jackson’s kick was un-
successful.

After taking Davidson’s kickoff,
the visitors were forced to kick
from their own thirty-nine. The
Kittens took the ball on their own
thirty-seven and Elkins and Dave
Erwin drove the ball down to the
sixteen where Erwin went over
tackle for the second marker. The
conversion was unsuccessful, and
the quarter ended 12-0. ;

Early in the second period, a
Davidson penalty gave Lees-McRae
the ball on the Kittens eight-yard
marker. But four downs failed to
produce any gain, and the ball
transferred hands. After a return
of punts and a Kitten recovery of
a Lees-McRae fumble, the Kittens
first string backfield began another
drive which ended with Troutman
going over tackle for the third tally.
The kick failed and the score stood
at 18-0. When the half ended, Da-,
vidson was again in scoring posi-
tion on the visitors two yard
stripe.

Dave Erwin opened the second
half with a beautiful 60. run-back
of the kickoff, but was called back
on a clipping penalty. After an
exchange of punts, the Kittens
marched back up the field, and cul-

| minated this eighty-yard drive with

a touchdown, making the score
stand at 24-0. Again the conver-
sion failed of completion.

Ewart Stars |

In the-final period, Earp, Foule,
and Ewart drove another one across
from the thirty, Ewart crossing the
line-on-a—reverse._Jackson’s kick
was good, and the score rose to

After a listless first half marred

by— frequent penalties, Davidson

struck with explosive fury in the

ing 54-0 victory over the Wofford
Terriers in an after dark clash at
Charlotte Memorial-Stadium.

Approximately 7,500 fans sat in

Wildcats cut loose in the third and
fourth stanzas, as they got set for
the crucial game with N. C. State’s
league leading Wolfpack Ra-
leigh this Saturday.

The Wildcat attack was shackled
and the tempo of the game slowed
considerably by the numerous pen-
alties incurred during the first and
second periods. In the course of
the evening, Davidson lost an even
100 yards, with one five yard set-
back nullifying Guy’s first quarter
scoring jaunt.

Gain 468 Yards

In trouncing the Terriers, Story’s
team rolled up nearly 400 yards
on the ground, and added 68 yards
through the air. The Cats played
a sterling defensive game, holding
Wofford to a net of minus 44 yards
rushing.

After receiving the opening kick-
off, Wofford made no headway and
was forced to punt. Sheppard re-
turned the ball 10 yards and the
first scoring drive was under way.
With Sheppard’and Erwin alternat-
ing, the Wildcats drove" down to
the 23. From that point Erwin
smashed through the middle on a
spinner and dashed over for David-
son's initial score. Mapes missed
his conversion, and the Cats had
a 6-0 lead.

Later in the period, Guy sprinted
off tackle for a touchdown, but one
of the Wildcats’ many
nullified the play.
