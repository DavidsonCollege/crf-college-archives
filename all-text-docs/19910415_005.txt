Perspectives on Sexual Violence

Rape Can Happen Anywhere, at Any Time, To Anyone
| \

By Heather Flint

I’m talking today to let you
know that rape does not discrimi-
nate. It affects any class, any race,
any age. Any of you are potential
victims of rape. You may have
been raped or have friends who
have been raped. To the men in this
audience - yes, you yourself can be
raped, although that is rather un-
common. However, many of you
may experience the rape of a sister
OR a girlfriend. Rape affects you
too.

Iam a freshman here this year,
and at age 17 I am one of the

youngest students oncampus. But ~

youth has not protected me from
rape. A year and a half ago, on
October 18th, 1989 I was raped. At
the time I was only 16. I was visit-
ing Princeton University as a pro-
spective on a weekend very simi-
lar to our SGA weekend here. I
was staying with my host, Deb,
from Thursday evening until Sat-
urday afternoon.

Thursday night I had a blast.
Debbie took me to a small party at
her boyfriend’s room. I danced and,
like most prospectives, I drank,
but nothing bad came of it. I al-
ready had a decent tolerance from
typical high school parties. and
experimentation with alcohol, sol
pretty well knew my-limit. I meta
lot of really nice people - and I had
my share of guys hit on me- typical
of SGA weekends. However, I

made it very clear that I had a
boyfriend, Jeff, who I had been
seeing for a few months, and that I
had no desire to fool around be-
hind his back. So Thursday night
came and went as usual. I had a

terrific time, sol was psyched when .

Debbie, my host, told me that her
boy friend was havinga larger party

talked for alittle bit when someone
handed me a drink - I don’t know
who - and since I was about done

‘with mine and knew two drinks

were well within my tolerance, I
took it. ;

The party began breaking up
soon after, since all the alcohol had
run out, so we were all leaving to

IF YOU ARE RAPED, NEVER TAKE A SHOWER, NO
MATTER HOW DIRTY YOU FEEL, UNTILYOU HAVE
THE PROPER TESTS DONE. IT WILL MAKE YOUR
CASE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF YOU SHOWER.

Friday night and that I was invited.

Friday Debbie and I ate lunch
with some other prospectives. At
the far end of the table was a pro-
spective named Chris who, ittumed
out, went to ahigh school down the
street from my own. We talked
very briefly and then Debbie and I
left.

That night Debbie and I went
to the party at her boyfriend Rob’s
room. It was packed. Rob saw me,
and since he was bartending he
mixed me a drink. He was on the
other side of the room, so he had it
passed over to me by a bunch of
people. I was dancing when Chris,
the other prospective, saw me and
came over to talk. He seemed like
a nice guy - very conservative,
clean cut, went to a very preppy
school, and lived near by me. We

go to the eating houses. Deb had
disappeared somewhere with Rob
- I think to his room - so Chris
offered to walk with me to one of
the eating houses where I was
supposed to meeta friend. I thought
that sounded like-a good idea - it
wouldn’t be wise to walk across
campus alone, and Chris seemed
like an.o.k. person. On the way I
decided I HAD to go to the batn-
room, sO we went into one of the
eating houses, where I was directed
tothe women’s bathroom upstairs.
It was one of those really fancy
bathrooms, with a lounge outside
the stalls to sit on. Chris waited
there-while*T used the facilities.
When I came out Chris decided he
had to go too, so I waited in the
lounge while he-went. While he
was in the bathroom I began to feel

Not Their Problem, Our Problem

By Peter Tavernise
Marty Klein: July ’85 Feeling
Great “Stopping Rape: Women,
Read This to Men”

“One million women were

raped last year. That’s like every

single woman in Detroit or Dallas.
How are we -- how am I -- sup-
posed to comprehend something
as monstrous as the entire popula-
tion of Dallas being ravaged?

“Men support the acceptabil-
ity of rape whenever they don’t
take women seriously. Men deny
women their feelings (“Don’t be
afraid”), their experience (“Those
stares shouldn’t bother you”’) and
their power (“You owe me
sex”;”,Yoy say no but you really
‘mean yes”). And men support the
existence of rape whenever they
suggest that women “really want
it.” A woman who takes herself
seriously. won’t allow a man to
ignore what matters to her. This
goes beyond the issue of rape; if
you can’t count on him to be pas-
sionately concerned with
something just because it’s im-
portant to you how can you trust
him about anything?”

sault Prevention Project Handbook

“When we were boys, we
didn’t have the power to stop lies
and violence. But now that we are
men, we do. We have the power to
tell the truth. We have the power to
stand with boys who are growing

up now and help them defend their —

caring. We have the power to stop
being “ordinary guys” and become
something much better: men with

ought to think about questioning
the roles I was taking for granted.

Over the last two and a half
years I have become conscious of
the problem of sexual violence
mainly through my friendships and
relationships with women. One by
one, as I became close to my
friends and lovers, there would
come. a time of trust in which I
would hear almost precisely the

I realized I hardly knew five women who had not been victimized by
male violence, or at least, had not said anything about it yet.

safe.”

For me, the issue of awareness
of sexual violence has become one
of self-respect and of mutual re-
spect in any relationship between
two people. For many years I had
been conducting my life as un-
questioningly as many of the men
we are now seeking to educate. I
feel now that I had been living irre-

sponsibly. I had bought the idea of ©
a “normal” way that men and

women conducted themselves in

relationships -- I think because I
was not aware of the options. I was .

unquestioning because I had never
had a reason to question -- and
indeed never had anyone, male or
female, old or ‘young, tell me I

same thing: “I haven’t really told
anyone about this but... . “
through the tears of women cher-
ished would come the personal
history of victimization and, I feel,
entirely inappropriate feelings of
guilt and shame. One woman told
te: ‘He raped me at gunpoint in
high-school. Not even my parents
know. I almost committed suicide
freshman year. I still have night-
mares every single night, oh but
you get used to them...” Another
said “A man once attacked me and

,tried to rape me on the baseball

fields. I can’t feel safe anywhere
now.” and another: “My own hus-
band, my own husband .. .”

I realized I hardly knew five
women who had not been victim-

and

extremely dizzy and realized some-
one had probably spiked my drink.
I sat down on a chair, passed out,
and the next thing I remember was
coming to on the bathroom floor,
with my head being pushed into
the wall under the sink with my
face bumping into the pipes under-
neath. I was unclothed and I saw
that I was being attacked, that I
was being raped - and my attacker
was Chris. I say SAW it happen-
ing because I couldn’t feel it - the
alcohol had numbed my body. I
tried to scream but I couldn’t make
my mouth work. I couldn’t move
my body. I could only sce that I
was being raped, and could do
nothing about it.

I must have passed out again,
for I woke up in this strange room
ona sofa, fully dressed. I realized
I must have passed out but had no
recollections of the rape. When I
got up I was kind of sore, but I
thought that I must have slept
wrong. Chris was lying on a sofa
nearby but for some weird reason I
could not remember his name. It
was late -- around 4 a.m., and I
realized that both of our hosts must
have been worried, so I woke him
up and we walked back to our
dorms together. The whole way
back I kept having these scary
thoughts go through my _ head,
images of being attacked. I saw
pictures of being raped by the guy
nexttome, The images were freak-
ing me out. I dismissed them as a

ized by male violence, or at least,
had not said anything about it yet.
Then I found out even one-of my
roommates had been sexually as-
saulted when he was a boy. I began
to despair. I felt powerless. Worst
of all to me at the time: I saw
myself and my own history as
having possibly.contributed to the
perpetuation of a society which
condones sexual violence.

I became involved in rape
awareness last year. I wanted to
see that it became a policy of this
college to educate women on this
campus of the existence of rape,
and the men on thiscampus of their
individual responsibilities and
potential. After all, I felt, the po-
tential rewards of an equal rela-
tionship -- one built on mutual
respect -- should obviously out-
weigh any small “loss of power”
men might risk from ending the
subjugation of women. Most men
do not know what it is to live in
fear, nor do they realize that for
women, living in fear is a fact of
life. Most men also do not realize

how much they contribute to that °

fear, and perpetuate it daily by
their unconsidered actions. ~
Many people who had been
victimized -- or who knew some-
one who had been victimized --
joined the rape awareness effort,
including quite.a few men, which!

bad dream I must have had while I
was passed out. ButI rarely dream,
and I certainly had never had such
awful dreams before. When he left
for his dorm (mine was further
away) I decided that Deb was
probably in Rob’s room yet, so I
went into his dorm and on the way
stopped at the bathroom. It was
there that I discovered my under-
wear was gone and then I KNEW
what had happened. I flew into
Rob’s room but Deb wasn’t there,
so Iran to Deb’s room, screaming
and crying the whole way. I
couldn’t believe it had ‘actually
happened. It wasanightmare come
true. :
* While I was crying Debbie
called the police. While we were
waiting I flew into the shower,
ripping off my clothing as I went.
I felt so dirty, so unclean. I stayed
in there, scrubbing and scrubbing,
trying to wash away the memory.
When I came out and got dressed
the police and representatives from
the rape crisis center were there.
They took me to the police station
first. 1 was scared to death. What
were they going to do? I had been
drinking. Wasn’tI going to get
into trouble? And what was I to do
about the rape? Ihad beena virgin,
and suddenly I was faced with
questions I had never had to deal
with before. Did I get pregnant?

found heartening. I was proud that
my sister was part of the effort, but
had not considered that she might
be involved not only because many
of our friends had been victimized,
but because she herself had.

This revelation has been a dif-
ficult one. Here is my sister I love
so dearly, telling me that she had
been victimized as a child -- when
we were little -- and again in high
school. As she spoke I feltso proud
of her for having the strength, de-
termination and caring for herself
to confront the violence done to
her and to attempt to heal it.

Men, know that your life and
the lives of those you love are
likely to be affected if this problem
isn’t addressed, By us. We are the
solution and we must strive to
educate our brothers as to their

.. personal responsibilities and true

potential. There is no excuse for
rape. Women and children will
continue to be victims until we
cease to be violent, assuming like
immature brats that we should get
whatever we want or that we can’t
really control our own impulses.

“Get serious. This is not their prob-

lem, it is our problem.

I cannot begin to tell what ef-
fectthis will have onme ultimately,
but I intend that the immediate
