Letter to the Editor

To the Editor:

Peggy Britt’s article “PCC
Studies Financial Woes” in last
week’s Davidsonian misin-
formed readers about the com-
mittee formed by the PCC and
the performance of the treasu-
rers on’ Patterson Court. As
‘treasurer of Emanon and 4
member of the PCC I am quali-
fied to clear up any misunder-
standings.

First,.the committee (called
the PCC Finance Committee in
the article) was formed for the
purpose of studying plans to
maintain a stable membership
_.in_the houses through three
terms of the school year. The
trend has been for all the houses
to be at maximum membership
Fall term, but_membership de-
clines Winter term and is dan-
gerously low Spring term.

To remedy this situation the
business office presented a plan
to the PCC last spring recom-
mending that a $50 deposit be
paid by each house member to
be refunded should the member
remain at the house all year.
The committee was formed to
examine this plan or provide al-

ternatives to help remedy the
membership problem.

My gripe is that the commit-
tee failed to deal with the pro-
blem for which%t was formed.
Several members of the com-
mittee, the chairman in particu-
lar, were opposed to the busi-
ness office’s proposal and rather
than come up with an alterna-
tive plan blamed the financial
problems of the houses on the

The Davidsonian ——--—-----——-

"The current treasurers on the
court are better regulated and
more informed as a group than
ever before. Financial reports
‘are turned in to the business
office each month, in addition to
term and year-end reports. All
tax returns are audited by a
CPA before submittal to the
IRS. The business office sup-
plies each treasurer a booklet
that outlines in detail the finan-

cial management of a house.

Obviously the financial pro-
blems most houses are experi-
encing are’ not a result of
‘inexperience of the treasu-
rers.””

Mr. Currie tried to point out
these facts about the treasurers
to Britt, but he said she did not

seem interested.

It is the opinion of many
members of the PCC, Mr.
Currie, and myself that the

current financial problems on
Patterson Court are caused by
the drastically reduced mem-
bership most houses experience
during spring term of each year.
I hope the PCC will again ad-
dress itself to the membership
problem and that this time the
committee will deal with the
probiem it is confronted with
instead of trying to hide it.

‘Fo the I Editor:

Regarding Peggy Britt’s
front page article, “‘PCC Stu-
dies Financial Woes,'’ I would
like to clarify some issues
raised.

Last spring the Patterson
Court Council passed a resolu-
tion to look into the problems
created by the unlimited mobili-
ty on the court. This resolution
was passed at a time when
many of the houses were in fi-
nancial trouble caused, not by
inexperienced treasurers who

Firestone decision

by STEVE AUSTIN
PIRG Columnist

During this summer, the
public learned that a potential
defect existed in one of the most
popular tires on the market; the
Firestone steel-belted radial.
Great publicity was given to the
number of accidents attribu-
table to this tire and the
economic effects of recalling
such a widespread item.

PIRG wrote the National
Highway Traffic Safety Admi-
nistration to find out the pre-
sent status of the Firestone
recall. The following is a res-
ponse to our questions by Mr.
Lynn L. Bradford, Acting As-
sociate Administrator for En-
forcement of NHTSA:

“On July 7, 1978, our Deputy
Administrator made an initial
determination that a safety-re-
lated defect exists in Firestone

tured by the Firestone Tire and
Rubber Company under other

pany dealers).

“On August 7 and 8, we con-
ducted a public meeting at
which Firestone and other inte-
rested parties presented their
views and-evidence an this

strators’ consideration of all.

and over 50 injuries alleged to
be caused by those tires.

to any obvious faults with these
tires such as bulges, tread

periodic inspection for tire .con-
dition and proper inflation to
minimize the potential for blow-

symptoms are noted, a consu-
mer should take the tire to a
Firestone dealer for adjustment
and retain all records of the
transaction or keep the tire for
possible free replacement in the
event of a final defect determi-

When the committee referred
to in the article was set up its
sole purpose was to find a way
for the court as a whole to battle
this problem. Obviously this
committee misunderstood its
intended, purpose. They came
up with some suggestions
which, although they are possi-
bly valid, still leave the original
question unariswered.

The deposit proposal men-
‘tioned has not been discounted
completely. The issue is still up
in the air and the PCC is

To the Editor: —_—

We feel that it is our duty to
the public to fulfill an unneces-
sary void in your journalism.

After the article on the Fresh-

lengthy litigation process is
completed. —

**We would also appreciate
consumer notification so that
our record of failures will be
more complete. Reports can be
made to our Auto Safety
Hotline (toll free number 800:
424-9398).

“The Firestone case will un-
doubtedly have an influence on
the tire industry in the United
States but the final influence
will only be determined. when
the issue is resolved.”

That determination should
come within the next few weeks.
PIRG appreciates the role that
ah agency such as the NHTSA
serves in the interest of the
public.

In next week's column. PIRG
will show what the nature of the
NHTSA is and how it is helping
the American citizen.

Therefore, we suggest that
the following be printed as an
update to the delinquent article:

To the Editor:

While walking across the
campus on my way to class one
morning, I noticed that some-
thing was missing. Since Fall
Term has begun, not once have
I had the pleasure of hearing the
bell on top of Chambers.

Although many of the fresh.
men may be purzled (“What
bell atop Chambers?"'), faculty
and studénts with whom I have
spoken all agreed that its sound
added a subtle flavor to life here

none other than the gentlamen

Another important deletion
was also discovered. Informa-
tion was provided that Will
Terry and Doug Horn had been
forcefully deposited in Lake
Norman. However, the identity.
of those responsible was once
again “accidentally” left out.
Proudly, we would respond that
it-was 3rd Watts who mastered
this sinister deed.

Thank you for bringing this

We didn't realize there were any
gentlemen on third Watts.

Granted, most Senior Clase

useful, for example, the Big
Screen television in the union.
But this bell represents a tradi-
tion which Davidson should not
allow to disappear, leaving a
rusting and useless bell atop
Chambers Building to represent
the Class of 1975.

- waiting on a report from. the
committee regarding mobility
with solutions and ideas: Hope-.
fully there will be action on this
by the end of the term.

Personally I think The Da-
vidsonian jumped the gun on
this issue in its never-ending
search for earth shaking contro-
versy. There are widespread
opinions among members of the
Patterson Court Council regar-
ding what actions to take but
there is nothing approaching
the hard line implied in Miss
Britt’s article.

This may be an issue in the
future and, if it is, I hope The
Davidsonian is more diligent in
its reporting.

To the Editor: .
To the Union Board and the
Davidson Student Body:

We, the students at UNCC,
are pleasantly suprised but
happy to hear of your recent
achievement on the gridiron.
Until this fall, we thought your
‘nickname, the Wildcats, was a a
description of the student envi-
ronment.

Of course your teams have
enjoyed a reputation for their
high degree of humility and
generosity. Certainly, UNCC
can expect no less competitively
from Davidson at our Caro-
winds Day.

With that in mind, UNCC
now looks forward to our play-
day with Davidson, Saturday,
October 14.
