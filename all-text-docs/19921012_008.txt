Deep Thoughts:

The Law According to Kirby

I have always had an.acute
interest in the law. I grew up with
the idea that laws descended from
some immutable source in the heav-
ens and that this being dictated
what was right and wrong behav-
ior. Slowly. I have come to the
realization that each society has its
own laws which are influenced by
a variety of things, and the end
result is not always a precept of
righteous behavior.

In American society, the law
is the Constitution. This document
is useless, however, without a ju-
dicial body to interpret it. These
interpretations can vary from jus-
tice to justice, and often they con-
tradict each other. Hence, what
the law is for a given situation is
determined by a majority or con-
sensus. We know from our his-
tory, though, that the majority is
not always right. Situational eth-
ics, expediency, and personal bias
all have ways of corrupting the
majority’s ability to determine
what behavior is right and what is
wrong.

The Jim Crow laws provide
an illustrative example of how far
the law of the majority can stray
from what is right. The irony of all
of this is that as members of soci-
ety, we are subject to the law of the
day despite our individual capac-
ity for seeing its shortcomings.
Thus, in certain situations, we are
forced to obey unjust laws and risk
punishment for behaving justly.
Such is the price of societal living.

This condition is not nearly so
frustrating as dealing with the agent

in society whose job itis to enforce
the law. Any institution or seg-
ment of society who upholds the
law fulfills this role. For most of
us, however, this agent is the po-
lice. Many in the Davidson com-

munity face frustration with the
police each time they go to
Patterson court.

The prospect that one might
be given a ticket by another think-
ing person for possessing an alco-
holic beverage, despite the absence
of any perceivable harm to anyone
in doing so, has angered many on
this campus at one time or another.
Even more frustrating is that the
police officers charged with carry-
ing out such a task so often purport
to be handing down justice.

What is Beautiful?

We’ ve decided, incase you’re
wondering, to reserve comment

Wouldn’t it be wonderful if more
police officers judged the weight
of infractions by their harm to oth-
ers, rather than carrying out their
duty from the mindset, “Rules is
rules.”

Let me give you an example
of how such behavior on the partof
the law enforcement community
would benefit the rest of us. Sup-
pose you are parked illegally. As-
sume you have put your change
into a meter, but your time has run
out. A police officer approaches
the scene and determines whether
your action is presently harming
society.

Now, if no other parking
places were to be found, and sev-
eral cars or fire trucks or ambu-
lances were circling the block look-
ing for somewhere to put them-
selves, perhaps you would be guilty
of a crime. If you were parked in
the only handicapped zone for
miles, let’s say on top of of a
handicapped person, then you
would be subject to severe cen-
sure. In the absence of these or
similar conditions, however, the
police officer would be forced to
continue on his merry way.

This whole scenario is pure
fantasy, of course. The reality is

“So, smart guy,” you ask,

It’s not just me. Think about
it. We all do.

“No,” Bobby said.

Bobby was wise beyond his

I was trying:to think up a real
stumper, and Bobby was gabbing
with a bush, when his mom and the
dog showed up.

Bobby broke off his talk with
the azalea, squealed with joy, and
jumped for the dog, who he can
torture with relative impunity.

“Thanks for watching him,”
said his mom.

“No problem,” I said.
