Speakers urge equal rights for
homosexuals in the church

By ANDREW PRESTON
Staff writer

Reverends Janie Spahr and
James Graves spoke in the 900
Room on their personal experi-
ences as homosexuals in organized
religion. Both speakers are or-
dained ministers in the Presbyte-
rian church, but neither are cur-
rently allowed to serve in acongre-
gation.

Rev. Spahr grew up in a very
religious family and absorbed the
Presbyterian atmosphere in her
hometown. Even as a child she
knew that she wanted to be a min-
ister,

In fact, Spahr: told the audi-
ence that before she could read she
“misinterpreted the ‘pedestrian
crossing’ signs for presbyterian
crossing.”

At that time, homosexuality
was seen as evil and wrong. Spahr
described the prevailing attitude
“as a phase that people grow out
of.”

Spahr did not realize her sexual
orientation for many years although
she felt frustrated in her relation-
ships with males.
involved in many organizations in
college, but as she explains, “I
looked happy on the outside, but I
was empty on the inside.”

Spahr finally recognized the
source of her discontent, but not
before the failure of a loving but
unhappy marriage and.the birth of

twosons. The adjustment was not
easy, but eventually she became
proud to be who she was. “It took
a long time to go from saying ‘Oh
my God’ to ‘Thank you, God,’”
Spahr said. :

“The church was not as ex-
cited about my sexuality as I was,”
she says. Although she was of-
fered a position as a minister in
Rochester, the hational Presbyte-
rian Court blocked her accepting
it.

Spahr explained that “it was
hard because I knew what I wanted
to do and I was taught to tell the
truth, but I was not accepted by the
church,”

She adds, “I don’t want spe-
cial rights — just my baptismal
rights.”

Currently, Rev. Spahr works
as 4 “lesbian evangelist” and is the
founder of the: organization en-

titled That All May Freely Serve. .

Spahr speaks in many different
areas of the country, hoping that
people will begin to understand
the trials of homosexuals.

Rev. James Graves grew up in
a similar religious background and
also knew that his calling was to be
a minister. He had trouble finding
a church after he admitted his
sexual orientation.

Although a church did finally
hire him, he was asked to resign by
members of the congregation after
only three weeks. Graves left-the
church after five weeks, not be-

cause he was forced to, but be-
cause “I felt like the church was on
shaky ground.”

Soon after leaving this church,
Graves gave up his ordination and
began working for the theater.
Graves then taught at North Da-
kota University, where he became
involved in religion once again,
this. time as a member of an Epis-
copal Church.

However, after his partner died
of AIDS, the church told him that
they had no place forhim. In 1991,
Graves joined a church in Roches-
ter.

Graves admits that “if I were
not openly gay, I could probably
be re-ordained — but not now.
Every once ina while I see a job for
a church minister that would be a
wonderful experience.”

During the question and an-
swer period, one person asked
about biblical or theological roots
for the conflict between homosexu-
als and the church.

Rev. Spahr said that the prob-
lemis the interpretation of the Bible
and explains that people must
“know the context in which the
Bible passages were written.”

For example, Spahr points out
that the Bible appears to condone
slavery, which is clearly immoral.

Spahr said that the church is
sinning against homosexuals by
acting so unjustly, and that “we are
daring to love the church through
its violence and its ignorance.”

Seniors vote
for financial aid

By Brap D. CHASE
Staff Writer

’ The Class of 1996’s Senior
Class-Gift will be a one-time, four-
year expendable, need-based schol-
arship to help subsidize financial
aid for one incoming freshman.
Seniors voted to hold off on the
much-discussed new entrance sign.

Sarah Brewer, Co-chair of the
Student Class Gift Committee, of-
fered an explanation for the vote:
“A lot of students can’t come to
Davidson because of the financial
aspect, and we felt that our gift

' should offer an opportunity for
- educational advancement rather

than a physical improvement on
the campus.”

Associate Dean of Admission
and Financial Aid Kathleen
Stevenson-McNeely was also
pleased with the decision to offer a
scholarship, commenting that the
scholarship will “enable Davidson
to continue socio-economic diver-
sity on campus.” :

Dave Thompson, Co-chair of

the Student Class Gift Committee,
added, “The majority of the com-
mittee felt that the general student
body would be behind a scholar-
ship. We were pleased with the
voting results.”

The scholarship will be paid
out over a four year period and will
be worked into one incoming
freshman’s need-based financial
aid package.

The amount of the scholar-
ship will depend on the pledges
given by currentseniors. The com-
mittee is currently working on rais-
ing money and naming the schol-
arship.

Presently, there will be only
one scholarship, but both Brewer
and Stevenson-McNeely are opti-
mistic that future classes may take
the initiative and continue with the
scholarship funding.

The fund raising kick-off party
for the senior class will be held at
Clarence Fosters in Charlotte on
November 2. Food, drinks, and a
lottery for prizes — including Hor-
nets tickets — will be offered.
