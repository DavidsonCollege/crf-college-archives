PRESIDENT - ELECT
HARDING ON RELIGION

When told of his nomination,

. Senator Harding said: “I can only

pray the Omnipotent God that I
may be worthy in service.”

Later he said: “I wish every
man in America would attend
church. I wish men would be as
interested in religion as they are
in their own business. If the Gold-
on Rule was applied to business
we'd get along with better under-
standing among the people.”

Again: “We ought to have a re-
consecration to morality in this
nation. We need a hardening of

_ our moral sonse.”

VOLUNTEER BAND SENDS
DEPUTATION TO CHARLOTTE

Buck Currie and Bill Crane \ spent
Sunday in Charlotte on deputation work
for the Student Volunteer Band. Sun-
day morning the Pegram Street Pres-
byterian congregation heard these Vol-
unteers on the “Call” and the “Per-
sonal Appeal of Missions.” In the aft-
ernoon they spoke to the Christian En-
deavor Sociegy of the Tenth Avenue
Presbyterian Church, and that night to
the regular congregation.

Nearly six hundred persons heard Cur-
rie and Crane on Sunday night, and
they report that there was much in-
terest shown among the young people
of both congregations.

Make your headquarters in the Davidson Church. There are 50
with us when in societies in the 12 counties of the dis-
Charlotte trict and a good number of delegates,

both young men and young women, will
be present. The convention will open
on Saturday afternoon and continue
through Sunday evening.

Rev. Chas. G. Lynch, of Charlotte,
state and district president, spent a day
recently in Davidson, conferring with
Dr. Richards and the Davidson conven-
tion committee. Matters relating to the
reception and entertainment of the
delegates and to the program of the con-
vention were thoroughly discussed. Be-
cause of the college being here, a strong
effort is being made to get more than
the usual array of speakers used at the
district conventions. These speakers,
a stereopticon lecture, and the snappy
conference, will make a program that
should prove interesting to the students
and all the young people of the town.

Arnett Gamble, ‘23, is serving as
chairman of the convention committee,
with O. J. Allison, ’24, as vice-chairman
and secretary. Miss Willie Hendgrson
is to direct the securing of homes, and
J. C. Wool, ’22, with some teams of the
intermediate boys will give the dele-
gates the proper reception. Miss Fran-
ces Johnson will look after program
matters, and Miss Eleanor Moore the
arrangements of meeting rooms and the

. | decorations.

Activities

LEADS PROFITABLE
MEETING OF Y. M. C. A.

Mr. Hemphill, in a very helpful talk
before the Y Sunday night, told his
hearers something of the joys of close
union with Christ and of the blessings
to be derived from it.

Many people, he said, are afraid of
“holiness,” but the holiness as taught
in the Bible is one of the greatest privi-
leges which we, as Christians, can en-
joy. It was God’s original plan to dwell
with His people, and it is still the ideal
toward which we should strive.

Union with God will make us pure.
When Christ completely fills our hearts
there is no place for sin there.

Union with God will also give us
power. Christ can give us mastery over
our sins and shield us from falling, in
our temptations.

Finally, the life lived entirely in Christ
brings peace, for we are sure that we
are doing His will and that we are pro-
tected by His guidance. It was because
Paul lived his life in such complete
union with Christ, that God was able to
guide him in his labors and bring him,
against his will, from Asia into Europe,
and into the field of greatest service.

A beautiful saxaphone duet, “Whisper-
ing Hope,” by Buchanan and Booth, add-
ed a great deal to the spirit and tone of
the meeting.

MORE STUDENTS URGED
TO ATTEND STATE
VOLUNTEER CONFERENCE

Say, fellows, had you rather be on the
inside looking out, or on the outside
looking in? Now, if we were speaking
of a state penitentiary or a lunatic asy-
lum, unquestionably you would prefer

the outside; however, the thing that we
are interested in now is the Student
Volunteer Conference which is to be
held in Durham, N. C., during this com-
ing week-end. Representative students
from practically all of the colleges of
the State will be there, and those who
are on the “inside” in this case will be
the ones to be envied.

Davidson is to have about 15 men in
her delegation, and the following names
have already been turned in:

Baba, N. P.; Beck, W. F.; Bitzer, R.;
Bradford, W. Z.; Buchanan, W. S.;
Cunningham, C. E.; Moore,. W. -W.;
Moss, H. O.; McIlwaine, R.R.; Price, J.
P.; Roberts, D. W.; Chalmers, D. M.

At this time three vacancies are still
open. The fellows are to leave at noon
Friday, as the meetings begin Friday
evening, and will get back to Davidson
Monday afternoon. Beck and Buchanan
are to help with the music, and from all
indications at present the corvention
should be a great success.

SUNDAY SCHOOLS

The attendance at most of the rural
Sunday Schools showed a noticeable
falling off in attendance due to rainy
weather, but this is to be expected as all
country roads are now in bad condition.

Special services were held at the
Brawley School with Dr. Shewmake as
the speaker. A good musical program
was also given in connection with his
tall.

The new school established at Cowan’s
is progressing nicely and gives every
indication of becoming one of the most
flourishing in the extension work of
the “Y.”

The following is the attendance:

School. Pupils. Teachers.
Caldwell -....------... 54 5

BLUFFING AND KNOCKING

HOLD ATTENTION
OF BIBLE CLASSES

There was a slight increase in the at-
tendance at the Bible classes last Sun-
day and practically all the class leaders
report marked interest in the discus-
sions. The topic of the last lesson, Bluff-
ing and Knocking, was one which seem-

a

ed to appeal to practically everyone, and
many lively debates were staged as to
the evils of these habits. With more
subjects such as these the number of
boys to give up that Sunday morning
nap to take part in the discussions
should show a steady gain.

GLEE CLUB ENJOYS

(Continued from page 1)
son had preceded the club on an
earlier train and had a sufficient num-
ber of cars to convey the club to the
hotel. There being nothing to do be-
fore the performance, the Musical Wild-
cats decided to visit the movie show. A
serial and a comedy made up the pro-
gram for the day, and now all the boys
are wanting to arrange to go back every

Wednesday to see how the hero evaded |

the villian’s murderous attempts on his
life.

The concert in Lexington was given
in the High School Auditorium, which
was crowded to the limits. The concert
was greatly enjoyed by the audience for
encores were required for all numbers.
A large number of the school children
were present, and the stunts by “Jap”
Cumming were greatly enjoyed by them,
as well as the older folks.

At the conclusion of the program here,
those who were fortunate enough to
secure “dates” with the’ young ladies
went on their way rejoicing, while the
less fortunate ones went to the hotel
immediately, and spent the night in the
arms of Morpheus.

Thursday morning found the troup:
on the train headed for the “Land of
the Sky.” Every one seemed to be full
of life and fun. Many amusing stunts
were pulled oft by the boys. McKeithan
gave a splendid interpretation of a blind
man, receiving sufficient compensation
for his labors to buy a stick of chew-
ing gum for every member of the club.
McGeachy caused great excitement when
it was learned he had found a lady who
had never been kissed. See him for
further particulars. The entire trip from
Lexington to Asheville was full of life,
ard although it was a long one it did not
become tiresome for this gay crowd of
music-makers.

On reaching Asheville the club found
a large number of the High School stu-
dents awaiting them with automobiles
which took them to the High School
building where each member was as-
signed to the home of one of the stu-
dents. Too much cannot be said of the
splendid treatment of the boys in this
city. The audience at the performance
was not as large as it might have been,
due to an attraction at the city auditor-
ium which drew the crowd.

Hendersonville was the place of the
last concert; the club arriving there on
Friday afternoon. Mr. Fred Justus, who
is well-known to the Davidson student
body met the club at the train and ac-
corded them a hearty welcome to the
City.

The members of the club agreed that
this last concert was the best of all. The
Town Hall, where the club held forth,
was filled, both the main floor and the
balcony. The boys say they couldn't

help doing their best when they had so
many pretty girls right in front of them
—these being the girls from Fassifern
School. At the conclusion of the per-
formance the members of the Glee Ciub
had the pleasure of meeting the mem-
bes of the senior class of Fassifern
School, under whose auspices the con-
cert was given.

After the girls had gone the boys dis-
persed in groups of twos and threes, go-
ing in various directions to spend their
time in different ways. A quiet night
was enjoyed by the entire crowd, ex-,
cept McKeithan, who said he couldn't’
sleep for the ravings of Heinie Myers
about the pretty girl he had met. :

The club returned home by way of!
Spartanburg, a private pullman being:
their's from Spartanburg to Charlotte. |
They arrived on the Hill late Saturday
evening. Every member of the troupe
expressed himself as having had a won-
derful time. From Spartanburg to Char-
lotte the boys enjoyed the private car
which the conductor so kindly furnished
them.

Those making the trip were: C H.
