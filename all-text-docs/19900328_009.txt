By BRUCE BALESTIER
It’s likely safe to assume that
by now you've been angered
by the fact that Johnston Gym
(now apparently known as

some of that financial burden is
being borne by the Athletic
Department. Itis for this reason
that Baker continues to operate
under abbreviated hours. As it

Johnston Building) will be
closed for the next five weeks
for the showing of an art ex-
hibit. If you think about it,
though, this is only logical, for
Johnston Gym has been mi-
raculously transformed into an
extension of the College Union.
Art exhibits, and the like, are
the stuff of which college un-
ions are made. That a problem
exists at all is simply because
Baker Sports Complex is not
fully operational. And itis a bit
alarming that there is not an
outlet for exercise at times (for
instance, most evenings after 6
p-m).

Nonetheless, it seems to mea
problem through which wecan
live, at least for a time. That a
college of our modest size pos-

-sesses an athletic complex of
the magnitude of Baker at all is
nothing short of incredible. At
the same time, it seems fairly
evident that the college as a
whole is navigating some diffi-
cult financial straits, and that

is, from what I can gather, the

weight room has been opened
with a considerable amount of
new weights for student use
during Baker’s open hours.
The still-undermanned staff at
Baker has done an admirable
job at keeping the main gym
floor open for basketball until
the upper courts are ready for
basketball (the necessary pad-
ding is due in any day now, I
am told), and IMAC volleyball
games have already taken
place on those upper courts. A
full. operating schedule, like
the one on which Johnston ran,
is definite for next semester,
and may even come to pass
before school’s end.
Meanwhile, the baseball
Wildcats are red-hot, notwith-
standing a 15-6. loss to the
Wolfpack of N.C. State Tues-
day at Wildcat Park. Entering
that game, senior second base-
man Mikio Aoki led the team
with a .353 batting average.

{In Good Health Says Goodbye

Prose

By MARK D, PUCKETT

Centuries ago when my

‘my famous cousin Leroy
Rochester Jones Puckett
began a health column
called Inn Goode Healthe for
unhealthy pilgrims. But Pil-
grims pouted over the con-
tent and lynched Leroy
Rochester with a stalk of
corn. The day of the lynch-
ing, though, Leroy spoke
the last impudent brazen
saucy words he would ever
speak again by captiously -
asserting, “Ha, the joke’s on
