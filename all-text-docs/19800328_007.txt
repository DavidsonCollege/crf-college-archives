Spirited entertainment in Charlotte

By ALISON LEWIS
Staff Writer

If nights spent in front of the
big screen in the Morrison
Room or intellectual conversa-
tions over Wildcat Specials in
the snack bar aren’t enough to
whet your cultural appetite, try
going a little further south.
Only twenty minutes from the
Davidson College microcosm
lies a whole season of entertain-
ment in Spirit Square nestled in
uptown Charlotte.

The initial concept of a cul-
tural arts center for Charlotte
sprung from a need to revitalize
the decaying business district in
1975. Stephen Crougar, a Da-
vidson alumnus and Spirit
Square Public Relations Direc-
tor explained that the area was
to serve as a ‘cultural hinge”
for Charlotte and Mecklenburg
County.

‘In addition to the Square
itself, the Discovery Museum
and the Charlotte Public Li-
brary are on the same block.
The activities and education
center of Spirit Square opened
in 1976. This year marks the
opening of the Performance
Place, an 800 seat theatre.
The theatre, according to Crou-
gar,.is ‘‘unique;in that it is so
intimate.” Located in the reno-
vated sanctuary of a neo-Byz-
antine Baptist Church which
was built in 1903, there is no
seat which is situated more than
70 feet from the stage.

This summer a new rehearsal
hall, the Rehearsal Place, will
open. The Square is funded by
the City of Charlotte and Meck-
lenberg County by a 2.5 million
dollar bond issue and $850,000

in additional donated funds.

The first season of Spirit
Square theatre will be ushered
in on April 16th with a special
performance by Joel Grey.
Other performers include Odet-
ta, (April 17), William Windom
Plays Thurber (April 25), Car-
los Montoya, guitarist (May
16), and Dizzy Gillespie, jazz
player (May 23).

In addition to this spectacu-
lar card of musical perform-
ances, Spirit Square is also
offering nine theatre perform-
ances as part of the Mecklen-
berg Theatre Festival. These
presentations range in diversity
from UNCC’s performance of
Peter Weiss’ bizarre Marat/
Sade (April 22) to a more
traditional performance of
Thornton Wilder’s The Match-
maker by Dr. Rupert Barber
and the Davidson College De-
partment of Theatre and Speech
(May 2).

Tickets to Spirit Square’s
concerts average $6 and tickets
for most theatrical perform-
ances are $4. Several season
ticket plans are also available
and their price depends on
various combinations of shows
and performances.

For more information on per-
formances and ticket prices, call
the Spirit Square Box Office
(376-8883) from 10:00 a.m. to
6:00 p.m. Monday through
Saturday and from noon to 6:00
p.m. on Sunday. To get to
Spirit Square take Interstate 77
South to the Brookshire Free-
way exit and go east. Exit onto
Tryon Street: going South and
the Square is located on the
corner of North Tryon and 7th.
