MacCormac Takes Post *'

As Honors Center Dean ..

By BETSY ALEXANDER
Contributing Editor

Professor of philosophy Earl
MacCormac announced the
establishment of a revamped
Honors College program at an
Open End meeting Tuesday
night.

On Wednesday afternoon
MacCormac accepted the
position as dean of the new Cen-
ter saying, ‘I want to build this
to be a first quality center of
departmental and in-
terdisciplinary honors for
special students.

The Honors College, renamed
the Center for Honors Studies,
will begin next year on a
program to increase interaction
among students and faculty
participating in the program as
well as the college in general.

Along with MacCormac going
into the Honors College will be
Professors John Kelton of the
psychology department; Frank
Bliss, English; David Grant,
biology ; and Ernest Patterson,
economics, the last of whom
will be on leave fall term of next
year.

MacCormac emphasized two
objectives for the Center: con-
tinue special projects as it has
had in the past, in one area or in
several interdisciplinary areas;
and to incorporate members of
departmental honors into the
Center for Honors Studies.

“‘One of the problems in the
past,”’ said MacCormac, ‘has
been that students tended to go
off on their own, with little
group interaction.”’

To correct this situation,
MacCormac proposes to have
group meetings consisting of
lectures, symposia, or lunches
at least once a week.

He also hopes to have films,
student performances and lec-

_ tures, open to the public, and a
small library at the Honors

students to participate in a joint
project ‘‘for no more than a
sixth of their time.

One project, in ecology, will
be a study of the Rocky River,
the history, economics, con-
tributions made by the different
pollutants, including Davidson
College, and how much it would
cost to clean it up.

Both faculty and students will
participate, each in_ his
preferred area, under. the
direction of Grant.

“We've applied for an EPA
(Environmental Protection
Agency) grant from the federal
government. The pilot project
will begin next spring,’’ added
MacCormac.

To increase the availability of
professors in the Center, each
professor will be in the Honors
College one afternoon a week, in
addition to his regular office
hours.

“I expect to be over there full-
time beginning this Sep-
tember ,"’ MacCormac said.

Congress

By TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor

William Miller, assistant
director of admissions,
expressed a mood of guarded
optimism this week in the
face of a move by the USS.
Congress to extend for one year
the National Direct Student
Loan (NDSL) and _ the
Educational Opportunity Grant
(EOG) programs.

The NDSL and EOG plans are
two federal programs by which
a student may presently finance

However they will be discon-
tinued if Nixon's plans for
higher education funding are
approved.

The award was given at a ceremony Wednesday afternoon.

Each professor will also offer
at some time during the year,
an introductory course in his
field for non-majors, in such a
way so as not to repeat the
regular courses offered by the
college.

Another change, making it
easier for students to move in
and out of the Center will be the
assignment of grades and

‘dummy numbers" to each
course offered.
MacCormac. wants to en-

courage participation of stu-
dents from all levels, including
freshmen and those students
who do not have a specific goal
in mind when they apply, the
purpose being to create the
skills a student needs to develop
a project.

Students interested in ap-
plying to the Center should stop
by the Carolina Inn between
8:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. and
and pick up guidelines and a
brochure describing the Cen-
ter's operation

May Continue Student Loans

blocked by the Administration
if it exceeds the ceiling which
has been placed on this area of
the budget,’’ Miller said.

“Still, I think that one way or
another, the NDSL and the EOG
will be extended, at least for
next year.

“The Basic Opportunity
Grant (BOG) was Nixon's plan
to replace the other funding.
The admissions office was sup-
posed to have the guidelines for
this funding no later than April,
but we still have not received
it,’ he said.

Miller said that the ad-
missions office had been gran-
ting aid on the assumption that
the NDSL funds would be
available next year. Students
are being asked to apply direc-
tly to banks for federal loans
first, and then appeal to David-
son if this avenue falls through.

‘“‘As for work study jobs, the
college will continue to offer
these,’’ said Miller, ‘‘since we
really need to have these jobs
done in any case.”

The status of financial aid at
Davidson has been clouded by
federal budget maneuvering
since January, when President
Nixon announced cutbacks in
financial aid for students to en-
courage a balanced federal
budget

Delays in working out the
mechanics of the BOG,
however, caused fears that: the
program could not possibly be
implemented before August or
September, or too late for next
year’s entering freshmen.

The Senate and House have
recommended that the BOG be
deferred for at least a year and
they have allocated funding for
it at a level too low for operation
in the fall.

This bill also provides that the
NDSL and the EOG programs
be extended for an additional
year.

The bill will now face the
possibility of a Presidential

Though the student aid ap-

propriations it makes are no
more than the amounts recom-
mended by Nixon, the bill is tied
to another measure offering
federal education to areas im-
pacted ,by government em-
ployees| which appropriates

more money than Nixon
requested.
The possibility of impounding

this money has been a con-
sistent threat of the Ad-
ministration. The federal finan-
cial aid packages were cut in

the same action that reduced

spending on poverty programs
such as the Office of Economic

Opportunity.

“We probably will not know
just how much money will be
available for us until this sum-
mer,” continued Miller.

‘Federal programs are never
fully funded, but we are plan-
ning on maintaining our
programs of financial aid at the
present level,"’ he said.

mal academic ceremony.

the honorary doctor of laws
degree.

Announcement of Omicron
Delta Kappa selections will also

ide Range Of Activities

with a little more zip than
National Honor Society has in
high school,’ Assistant to the
President Duff Bruce said.

Students are encouraged to
pick up their free tickets to the
convocation luncheon by Friday
morning in Dean of Students
Will Terry’s office. The lun-
cheon will be held in Chambers

Convocation will serve as the
opening activity of the alumni
weekend, according to
Associate Director of Alumni
Relations Zack Long.

‘Having Spring Convocation
and Alumni Weekend gives us a
very positive occasion on which
alumni can see the achievement
of our students and staff and be
here at Davidson when it is
recognized,” said Long.

All parents of students have
been invited to the ceremony,
according to Bruce.

‘“‘We don't want parents to
feel that they're just on the
periphery of Davidson College,
just bringing their sons and
daughters here once a year and
then taking them home," said

“We look at this as an op-
portunity to bring the whole
college family together." Long
indicated.
