Proposed Changes for |
Freshmen Advisor Elections

By Suzanne Davis'91 and
Bill Smith '91

The office of Freshman Advi-
sor at Davidson is one that has
been surrounded by an aura of
mystery for most of the student
body. After reading their hand-
books, freshmen wander around
campus feeling neglected by those
so called Freshman Advisors who
have yet to give them one ounce of
advice. And each year Patterson
Court suppers are interrupted by
candidates trying to explain the
job and to convince upperclass-
men that they would be most quali-
fied. We see millions of flyers and
spray-painted sheets decorating
dorm walls for a week in the Fall,
we vote (or according to the voter
turn-out, we don’t vote) and then
... nothing. Where did those Fresh-
man Advisors go?

In a few weeks the student
body will be asked to decide
whether ornotthe process forelect-
ing Fresman Advisors is appropri-
ate for the responsibilities involved.
And in order to make an educated.
decision, you should know exactly
what those responsibilties are.

Freshman Advisors work di-
| rectly with the Dean of Students

Office to interview, select, train,
and advise the Hall Counselors, a
| position that is not elected by the
entire stidentbody. With the Dean

Office, they plan Fall Orientation
for Hall Counselors and freshmen.
Their duties begin immediately
after the election in November and
continue until the next freshman
Advisors are elected.

We believe that the current
election process does not properly
choose the team that will assume

of Students and the Residence Life.

the responsibilities of Freshman
Advisor. Our reasons for a differ-
ent selection processare threefold.

One, the Freshman Advisors
do not work with the entire student
body and could not accurately
represent the student body’s wide
variety of opinions if required toas
the election suggests.

Two, both the Dean of Stu-
dents Office and the Residence
Life Office deserve input beyond
that of persuasion because the
Freshman Advisors, as we have

rent election process

sibilities of Freshman
Advisor.

mentioned, work directly with
these offices.

And third, because the Fresh-
man Advisorselection isconducted
by itself, it receives a small per-
centage of student participation and
wastes the. time and effort of the
Student Government Association
and the applicants. We recom-

mend the following selection pro¢-;

ess:

(1). The, Freshman Advisor’

team must consist of one male Hall
Counselor and one female Hall
Counselor.

(2) Submit an application by
teams no later than 8:00 a.m. two
Tuesdays prior to the Thanksgiv-
ing break. The application would
consist of their reasons for apply-
ing and their statement of goals.

(3) A closed forum will be
held at the Hall Counselor meeting
prior to the Thanksgiving break
where the candidates will have the
opportunity to discuss their goals
before an audience consisting of
current Hall Counselors, current
Freshman Advisors, and at least
four representatives from both the
Residence Life Office and the Dean
of Students Office.

(4) After all of the candidates
have answered questions posed by
the forum, a vote will be taken by
confidential ballot, and the votes
will be counted by amember of the
Student Government Association.
The team receiving the majority of
the votes will assume the
responsibilities of Freshman Ad-
visors upon notification by the
Student Government Association
representative.

(5) The term of the Freshman

. Advisors will extend from the

above vote until May of their sen-
ior year. Freshman Advisors will
be responsible for the Hall Coun-
selor team which they selected
throughout the ‘entire academic
year.

A final observation is worth
mentioning. The Freshman Advi-
sor applicants will be able to focus
their energies on the position which
they desire to assume throughout
the selection process rather. than
plastering the campus with unnec-
essary posters, sheets, or flyers..

Thank-you for reading: our
proposal. We: would appreciate
your vote in favor of this change in
the upcoming election. If you have
any questions or comments con-
cerning our proposal please talk
with either of us.

Well, here we are again. An-
other week has passed in this hyp-
notic hamlet we know and love as
Davidson. Not much has changed
in the past week around here, ex-
epting the topic-of the petty chat-
ter. Last week’s “how was your
fall break?” has been replaced by
the post homecoming niceties of:
“how was your weekend?” and
“who was your date again?” It’s
pretty pleasant around here,

In the world at large, we see
before usa planet of multitudinous
maladies: a staggering national
deficit, the unreasonably high age
of consent, the alarming possibil-
ity thatthe Helms menace could be
e-elected next month as aresultof
e fear many southerners have of
ational, open minded humanists,
¢ ugliness in the Middle East, our
lecaying environment and the
ppalling lack of high quality
urbon-flavored underwear, just
name a few.

In spite of this, beloved reader,
all is right with the world. While
the Cincinnati Reds spend this week
competing forthe rightto be known
as the best baseball team in the
entire-world, Pete Rose_will be
rotting away in jail, a broken and
hated man. Yes, life is rich.

It is a sign of America’s potential

You see, for me, and for sev-

the kid who played hard and played
fair for fun and for the love of the

Rose and his crotch-scratch-

bully with the intellectual skills of
your average walnut, the home

lunch money and then offered to

INCREASING ISOLATION OF

Stifled Free
Speech on Campus

By Jonathan D. Kar!

Free speech is under attack on
college campuses, and even its
traditionally staunchest defenders
have joined in the assault.

Student journalists and free
speech advocates are concerned
about a proliferation of college
speech codes so widespread that,
according to Time magazine,
“Nowhere is the First Amendment
more imperiled than on college
campuses.”’ As is often the case
with censorship, these codes have

_ been adopted with the best inten-

‘tions; Campus racism is on thé rise
and something has to be foneaent
it. So token measures are. taken
which exacerbate racial tensions
and ignore the First Amendment.
Speech codes drafted in re-
sponse to this important issue are
dividing the American Civil Lib-
erties Union, which was always
tended toward an “absolute” posi-
tion on free speech. While the
Wisconsin and Michigan ACLU
affiliates have sued their respec-
tive state universities over the
codes, the northern and southern
Californiaaffiliates adopted.areso-

_lution in July favoring narrowly —

drawn policies which prohibit
harassing speech.

John Powell, national legal
director of the ACLU, asserts: “My
concern is less with the strength of
the First Amendment than with the
wave of racial harassment that has
swept the country. The campus is
not under the threat of being si-
lenced.”

Defending their resolution, the
California affiliates cite the legal
need to balance the First Amend-
ment against “conduct that inter-
feres with the Fourteenth Amend-
ment right of students to an equal
education.” They argue thatthe
resolution only advocates aban on
speech which is clearly harassing
and that “hostile, even offensive
speech in classroom debates and
public discourse is something stu-
dents must endure or challenge
with speech of their own.”

Free speech proponents. such
as writer Nat Hentoff are not buy-

ing. Pointing out that cases brought
under the codes will be heard by
untrained college judicial panels,
not civil libertarians or ACLU at-
torneys, Mr. Hentoff decrics the
inevitably vague nature of speech
codes. “Most colleges whose ‘due
process’ hearing I’ve covered arc
unshakably fond of the British Star
Chamber model of the 17th cen-
tury,” he remarks sarcastically.
“Just the places to deal with these
broad and vague restrictions on
speech.”

Rules which limit speech are
only as good as those who enforce
them. Eleanor Holmes Norton,
President Carter’s chair of the fed-
eral Equal Employment Opportu-
nity Commission, explained this
bitter reality: “It is technically
impossible to write an anti-speech

code that cannot be twisted against

specch nobody means to bar. Ithas
been tried and tried and tried.”
Indeed, speech codes have
been defended by voices far less
moderate than those of the ACLU’s
California affiliates. At Stanford
University, law professors pro-
vided the philosophical rationale
for a new student conduct policy

’ that one student sponsor candidly

admitted, “is not entirely in line
with the First Amendment.” ABA
Journal, the publication of the
American Bar Association, quotes _

-Stanford Law Professor Mari
-Matsuda, who argues that tradi-

tional views of free speech actas a
self-serving cover for continued
domination by majority elites.

In Orwellian fashion, advo-
cates of the code argue that speech
limitations would actually increase
free speech and “‘vigorousdebate.”
Discriminatory speech, they rea-
son, is meant to silence the victim.
Such arguments are not only
clearly opposed to First Amend-
