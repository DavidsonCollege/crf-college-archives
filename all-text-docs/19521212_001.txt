resemble that of former years,
although some changes and va-

Honorary Council
Gets Constitution

At its last meeting the Honorary
Fraternity Council decided to draft
a definite constitution, which will
be drawn up by Bob Walker over
the Christmas holidays.

The council realized, that there
is a need for an interpretation of

its purposes as well as setting them
up in a forma: constitution.

The agency to interpret these
purposes is the Appraisal Com-
mittee composed of Bob Pos-
ton, chairman, A. K.. Garrison,
and Preston Chaney. This new
committee will investigate each
of the 22 organizations which
make up the Honorary Frater.

A general report plus a mem-

riations have been made of
necessity. and since the location
has been shifted from Cham-
bers Auditorium to the main

+ sanctuary of the new church.
Students will not be required to

attend the services because of the’

size of the crowd expected to at-
tend.

The music for this years’ service
is under the direction of Mr.
Donald Plott, head of the Music
Department, and Mr. Kenneth
Moore, band director.

Mr. Philip Gehring will be
at the organ. Taking part in
the service along with the
Male Chorug¢ will be the Chapel
Choir and the Davidson Col-
lege Brass Ensemble. Harriet
Boden Brask, voice instructor
at Newberry College, will again
be with us as mezzo soprano
soloist.

Instead of a small symphony
orchestra, this year a string quar-
tet, composed of members of the
music faculty and community, will
be heard.

Among those taking part in
the service will be Hubert
Cannon, Y President, who will
give the invocation and lead
the congregation in a special

Scripts 'n Pranks
To Publish Humor
Issue Thursday

The second issue of “Scripts ‘n
Pranks” for this year will be dis-
tributed to the student body after
chapel on Thursday, December 18.

As some students will be leav-
ing before that time, arrangements
have been made for mailing their
copy to them. These people should
give their address to Mike York
in 311 East dormitory and should
furnish a three-cent stamp.

A description of the remain-
ing three issues has also been
announced by Mike Myers,
editor. This issue once again
follows a humor theme, though
somewhat smaller than the first
issue.

This is being done to conserve

funds for the third issue. This
mammouth volume will be a
parody in the form of a take-

off on some national magazine.
The final issue will be complete-
ly literary.

Total To Rise

Give Later

With a whopping 53 per cent
of the student body contributing,
the Red Cross blood drive last
Wednesday and Thursday here on
the Davidson campus set an all-
time school record both for the
number of pints collected and the
percentage of students contributing.

Buddy Lamon, chairman of the
drive for the Scabbard and Blade,
the sponsoring organization, an-
nounced yesterday afternoon that
the 53 per cent does not include

‘those men who tried. to ‘contribute

and were turned down because of
age or other reasons. Neither docs
it include the members of the
basketball, wrestling, and swimming
teams who will contribute at a
later date. .

According to Lamon, a total of
433 pints of blood were donated by

Hassel Flays
Frosh, Sophs
For ‘Y' Drive

Charlie Hassell, publicity chair-
man for the drive, blasted the Y
Gift Fund home to the freshmen
and sophomores in a post--chapel
talk this morning.

Earnest Barry, after the talk,
emphasized what Hassell had said
by adding, “The freshmen and
sophomores seem not to under.
stand the importance of this drive.”

Saying that many students, espe-
cially the juniors and seniors who
have made contributions far ex-
ceeding, proportionate to numbers,
those of the lower two classes, were
disappointed in the response thus
far met.

“This is the main effort of the
student body toward benevolences
and the present apparent failure to
elicit the enthusiasm shown in
former years is not indicative of
the generosity that usually char-
actérizes the student body,” said
Barry.

$2,370.46 has been collected so fat
in the drive with 525 student re-
ports now in.

Moose’s Art Wins

Plaudits Of Critics

Philip ‘Moose, Pulitzer  prize-
winning artist and professor of fine
arts at, Davidson, has recently been
adding leaves to his laurels in the
field of art.

The soft-spoken, Newton, North
Carolina, native, was hesitant. in
mentioning to this reporter honors
which obviously show his worth.
but scem only to increase the
charm of his timidity.

His most recent achievement
and one that brought him men-
tion in the New York Herald
Tribune for Sunday, Dec. 7, is
the inclusion of a water color,
“Mayau Mystery. in a survey
of cutrent American art by the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
“Mayau Mystery” is a semi-ab-

Stract piece done in water color,
and this represents one of the
products. of Mr. Moose's study in
Aztec art. .

Not one to be retarding his
ever-productive talent, Mr.
Moose has been recognized by
the State Gallery in Raleigh.
where his “View of Cagnes”
in France, is now hung.

This picture was painted two
years ago while Mr. Moose was
in France.

Finishing a month’s showing
in Norfolk, Va., is a collection
of Mr. Mooce’s works that
cover a five-year period. All of
these were done after he won
the Pulitzer prize for painting
in 1948,

Mr. Moose has announced that
there will be a student show in
the lobby of Chambers in January.
This showing will display oil paint-
ings, water colors, and drawings
done in fine arts lab as well as in-
dependent works.

organization.

To give the occasion some his-
torical significance, the founders of
te society chose the new Student
Uriion as the place for the in-
auguaral meeting last Wednesday.

Kappa Delta Sigma is a local
organization. Several national hon-
orary societies in economics and
business were considered; but it
was decided a national organization
would be gnore expensive, inflexi-
ble to the desires and needs of the
local members, and would add no
more distinction to the members
and to the college than an efficient
locally formed organization. KIDS

express an interest and who prove
acceptable, “The society also in-

Kappa Delta Sigma. an honorary business fraternity. has
become the newest campus group after a year of discussion and

a

anti-trust suit, led by Bill..Bledsoe

Some of the reasons for and serv-
ices of Kappa Delta Sigma are
listed below. Tt should serve as an
incentive for students to strive for
higher scholarship in the Eco-
nomics and Business Departments.
as an honorary fraternity can re-
ward diligence, imterest, and pro-
ficiency. Second, it will provide a

means ‘for closer student-faculty
relationships by the formal mect-
ings and Sunday night get-to-

gethers which should bring together
the faculty members of the Eco-
nomics and Business departments
and students on a foundation of
common interest, aid; and under-
standing. KDS can be a medium
through which guest. speakers can
be invited and entertained on the
campus. This society should be able
to obtain prominent businessmen
and economists who are authorities
in their particular field for chapel
speakers. It is an opportunity for
students to obtain knowledge on
various subjects of current interest.
It should increase the students’ in.
terest. in their work as a result of
the interviews with businessmen,

movies on various industries, group
discussions, and talks on various
topics by faculty members and other

stuclents,

‘MALLOY GETS LIFE

Another Davidson man has found
fame in the national magazine
Life.

Neville Malloy, formerly of the
class of ‘52 now of Florida State
University, acliieved his present
notoriety by virtue of his being the
“boy friend” of the Florida State
homecoming queén, Warlies Gess-
ler.

Life thought. Warlies, a Polish
displaced person not fourteen
month ago, and her being elected
to the beauty spotlight. of such
importance to warrant a front page
spread. Neville didn’t make that.

He did rate a picture and com-
mont in one of the inner pages of
the story.

The popular blood. giant was ‘an
SAE while here. the Male
Chorus, was a cheerleader, on the

in

swimming team, and was majoring
in business,

Mr, C. Shaw Smith, director of
the Union and coordinator of stu-
tlent activities, had this: to say in
making the announcenient:

“Barring some unforeseen
emergency, the upper two floors
of the Ovens College Union will
be open and ready for use
when students return from the

Christmas holidays.”

Mr. Smith pointed out that the
weather and the scheduling of other
work by the asphalt contractor has

Cheers Favored;
Proctor Says No

There will bé no organized cheer-
leading at baskethall games. for
awhile this year. AHhough the vote
cast favored cheerleading, Howard
Proctor: felt that thecvote was not
representative. as only half of the:
students . voted.

tn order to find the. student
bodies’ opinion on cheerleading at
Winter and Spring games. cheér-
leaders last week conducted a. poll
in chapel...

In answering the question
concerning cheerleaders at the
games, 315 students voted
“yes,” while 288 voted “no.”
The vote on whether to have
a band or not was even closer:
281 voted “yes,” and 307 voted

+t ”

no.

There were muyy suggestions on
how to solve the problem. Typical
suggestions were, "Why not ask
the basektball players?” or “Leave
cheering at the games as it is.”

Coach Fetzer. when asked his
opinion, said, “I think that
cheering should be left up to
the students, but cheering defi-
nitely helps the team while
playing, especially when Da-
vidson is on the low end.”

Other benefits from having
cheerleaders .include more contro!
over the student cheering or jeering
when close decisions are made by
the referee, while on the other
hand many students seem to feel
that.our gym is too smali for or-
ganized cheering and a band,

Several basketball players were
asked theie opinion, and the gen-
eral concensus was that the team
favors as much cheering and. pep
as possible.

The final conclusion was,
however. not to have cheer-

The contractor has given as-

Stuart In Holy Land

A message has come from Ed
Stuart, who has interrupted his
work at Davidson for a trip to a
Religious Confereriee in India.

He was writing from the Holy
Land, from which place he says,’
“These three. short days in the
Holy Land have been our finest
yet in this recent interesting trip.
In spite of the political tensions,
commercialism and the relic wor-
ship. .we have found many of the
sacred spots very lovely and mov-
ing.
