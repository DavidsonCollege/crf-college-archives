Bookstore hosts
Angel Tree

By Sarah Teachworth

With finals rapidly approach-
ing, many students are finding
themselves with less time on their
hands to do good deeds. The
Davidson College Bookstore of-
fers an easy solution for those in a
crunch. For the first time ever, the
bookstore is the proud bearer of an
Angel Tree.

The concept

The purpose of an Angel Tree
is to provide children with Christ-
mas gifts. The children’s names
are written on paper angels and

hung on a Christmas tree. Cus-:

tomers choose a name and select a
gift to purchase. The gift is then
wrapped and given to the child.
Gwen Gardner, Manager of
the Bookstore, decided that she
wanted to have an Angel Tree in
the store after reading an article in
- the American Booksellers’ Asso-
ciation publication in September.
The article was about a similar
program at That Bookstore in
Blythville, Arkansas, which pro-
vided 1,038 needy children with
books last year. Gardner says, “I
liked the idea of the Angel Tree
initially because it offers everyone
— students, faculty, and staff —
an opportunity to share with the
community during the Christmas
season.” Student worker Leigh
Gaston added, “The Tree gives stu-
dents who are financially well-off

achance to help out less advantaged

children.”

Gardner contacted some of the
sponsors mentioned in the article
and was pleased to find that pub-
lishers were willing to help out,
Workman Publishing provided the
store with patterns for the angels,
and Harper Collins sent pre-cut.
stars for the tree.

In conjunction with Service
Coordinator Catherine Turner, she
arranged to receive the names of
approximately 120 first graders at
Davidson Elementary School. Bill
Giduz, Director of News and Pho-
tography, furthered the effort by
mentioning the project in the fac-
ulty and staff publication, the Cam-
pus Chronicle. It was the idea of
Campus Network Manager Linda
Campbell to include on the tree the
names of children at a local mis-
sion church. Gardner agreed that it
was an excellent idea, and about 20
more angels were added to the list.
Shortly before Thanksgiving
Break, student workers at the store
gladly trimmed the tree.

~ The process

It is not a difficult task to pro-
vide a child with a gift this holiday
season. The bookstore offers a
wide selection of children’s books
from’ such popular authors as Ri-
chard Scarry, Dr. Seuss, and Judy

RLO invites students to deck the halls

By Randy Hartwell

Though the Christmas spirit
may be the last thing on many
Davidson students’ minds this time
of year, RLO is encouraging them
to get into it with the third annual
Christmas Light-Up Nightcontest.
Students are invited to decorate
the inside and outside of their halls
as well as their entire buildings
with holiday themes,

Kurt Holmes of RLO expects
this year’s contest to be bigger

. than ever. “A lot of our staff [hall ..

counselors and RAs] were fresh-
men when we started it, and they
Teally enjoyed it and are now get-
ting their halls involved,” he says.

Basement Rich hall counselor
Heather Wineberg and her fresh-
men are getting into the spirit. “We
went shopping this morning, and
we're. really excited,” she says.
“It’s neat for us because we’re
doing what we did our freshman
year,” she adds.

Judging will take place on

December. Sth: at. i aces Sharon... --

Leahy of RLO, Annette Regan of
the Dean’s Office, Myrtle Knox of
the Union, and Larry Purcell of
Building Services will officiate,
handing out cash prizes (for hall
funds) to the campus’ biggest and
brightest.

Because much of the decora-
tion is inside and not as readily
visible, Holmes suggests that stu-
dents check out the competition of
other halls. “A lot of the inside
