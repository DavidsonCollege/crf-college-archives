In an exciting game on Wednesday,
May 4th, the Sophs won from the Fresh

seventh inning the Fresh had a big lead,
when the Sophs pulled up and won,
owing to their own heavy hitting and the
errors of the Fresh. Batteries: Sophs,
Fowle and King; Fresh, Nimocks and
Burns.

On Friday, May’ 5, the Fresh were
again defeated, this time by the Juniors,
by a 14-7 score. The game as a whole
was slow and accompanied with weak
fielding and batting. The Juniors hit
Nimock’s delivery pretty freely, while
the Fresh didn’t succeed in bunching
many hits off White. Batteries: Juniors,
White and White; Fresh: Nimocks and
Burns.

altho misplays were rather frequent.

Sophs was a feature. Batteries: . Jun-
iors, W. Keesler and B. White; Sophs,
McKeithen and King.

HIGH SCHOOL GIVES
COMMENCEMENT PLAY

On last Friday night the High School
commencement play was presented in
Shearer Hall, and proved interesting
to all.

First on the program was “A Tom
Thumb Wedding.” Among some of the
distinguished couples at the wedding
were Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, Mr. and
Mrs, Andrew Carnegie and Mr. and
Mrs. Vanderbilt. The bride was Miss
Mildred Hobbs, the groom Howerton
Alexander. The second number was
“A Quarrel,” and following this a selec-
tion from Miss Minerva and William
Green Hill, with characters William
Green Hill, Joe McConnell; Jimmie,
Hubert Mooney; Frances, Ruth Ervin.
Then Miss Dorothy Finlayson sang a
solo, taking the part of Geraldine Far-
rar. The last number of the evening
was “O You Teacher,” with Sam Brady
as teacher and Douglas Brown as assist-
ant teacher.

The whole exercise was a success, and
all the pupils went through their parts
in a creditable manner, due largely to
the careful coaching of the teachers.

LYCEUM ATTRACTION.

On last Saturday evening the last
number of the Lyceum course, that the

M. C, A. has been givine this year,
was presented in Shearer Hall. The en-
tertainment included a number of solos,
duets, impersonations, and concluded
with a one act play which embraced all
of the above parts: The impersonation
given by Mr. Bohannan, of the Trish
father with his little motherless child
was good. Another impressive feature
of the entertainment was the appeal
made in speech and song to the persons
in the audience to remember their moth-
ers and fathers. The form of the song
in each case was the acrostic of “mother”
and “father.” The songs and accompani-
ment of Mrs. Bohannan formed another
pleasing part of the program.

“The Palace.” Davidson’s moving
picture house, onened its doors to the
public on Thursday night with a large
attendance. Two nerformances will be
given each night of the week, at 7:15
and 8:00, with matinee on Saturday at
