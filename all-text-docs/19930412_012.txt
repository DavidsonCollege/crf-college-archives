Bon t Deny Presence of Racism in DCPD Policy

By George Spain

In the article “‘Isms at
Davidson” last week the question
was asked: “Why do African-
Americans get stopped so much
more frequently?” This question
refers toanincidentinvolving Chris
Leak, Cedric West, and DCPD of-
ficer Moore. This article is an
answer to that question.

The officer who stopped Chris
Leak and Cedric West insists that
this incident was motivated by
genuine suspicion and not racism.
He attempts to substantiate this
claim by retelling the events of that
night and by listing two primary
factors which he believes warranted
his legitimate suspicion of these
gentlemen. He does this ina letter
appearing in the April Sth issue of
The Davidsonian.

He maintains that he stopped

Integration

Inequity

First, Caucasians only associ-
ated with other Caucasians. And
African-Americans did the same,
only not by their own choice. In
fact, the only time Caucasians and
African-Americansconvened were
in the instances that African Ameri-
cans were being subservient to
Caucasians (e.g. housekeeping).
The division between the two races
meant that if any sharing was tc
occur, Caucasians would be ir
charge of the distribution anc
would remain with the best of ev-
erything. Then African-Americans
got angry and fought for the same
privileges. Hence, the conception
of integration. But does integra-
tion really exist, or is itjustanother
idealitsic term tactfully chosen to
keep African-Americans quietand
to help alleviate some guilt?

There are institutions all over
the country that claim to be inte-
grated but remain very segragated.
I like to call it “segregation within
integration.”

For example, Davidson is a
supposedly integrated institution,
right? But have you ever been to
the Commons, where almost ev-
eryday mostof the African-Ameri-
can students sit together and the
Caucasian students do the same.
What about at a game or on the
court—the very same thing oc-
curs. Hold it! Iknow whatsome of
you are about to say, “I have sat
with someone of a race different
than mine before.” Bologna! Be-
fore I move on, I suggest that you
think about that defensive state-
ment (above) and wake up.

The truthis, “integration” does
not work, ithas never worked, and
it never will work. Malcolm X
said it the best: “Integration is not
good for either side.”

Solongas African-Americans
continue to be used as examples or
“for the benefit of others,” instead
of appreciated and respected, the

these two gentlemen because they
were unrecognizable to him. and
because they hada bicycle in their
possession. In an earlier article in
the March 29th issue of The
Dayidsonian, an officer explained
that itis DCPD policy to question
and identify any person that they
cannot recognize. If these two
things--the inability of the officer
to recognize Cedric and Chris, and
their possession of a bicycle--were
the only things to be considered in
this incident, the officer would be

‘guilty only of doing his job. But

this is not the case; the element of
race-cannot be omitted or de-em-
phasized.

fis’ cinple anileasily proven
factthat more African-Americans,
African-American males in par-
ticular, are approached by the
DCPD than are whites or other

minorities. Based solely on this
reality, it is hard for me to believe
that two white students, or stu-
dents belonging to any other mi-
nority group, would have been
stopped under the exact same con-
ditions.

In the same article in which
the policy of questioning the iden-
tity of those who warrant suspi-
cion is explained hy the officer, he
also makes this statement: “There
are times that for some reason a
person just doesn’t look right and
you feel like you have to check
something out.” I cannot help but
believe that the color of Chris
Leak’s and Cedric West’s skin, if
only in an indirect and subtle way,
had something to do with their not
looking right.

' About one out of every four
African-American males (23%) is

either incarcerated, on parole, or
on probation (The Washington Post
Feb. 27, 1990: Pg. A3). The
imprisonment rate of African-
American males in the United
States is 3370 per 100,000 (The
Washington Post Aug. 8, 1992:
Pg. Al7). This number is astound-
ing when compared to the national
rate of 455 per 100,000 white males
(Christian Science Monitor Feb.
18, 1992: Pg. 20). It is estimated
that 80% of African-American
males will be imprisoned during
their lifetime (Christian Science
Monitor Feb. 18, 1992: Pg. 20).
Cedric West and Chris Leak
are nondescript African-American
males. They possess no particular
characteristics which would sepa-
rate them from these statistics.
They possess no particular charac-
teristics that would distinguish

them from any number of young
African-American males who
could have possibly been trespass-
ing on Davidsoncampusthatnight,
except one.

That characteristic, their en-
rollment at this college, is made
obselete when they are unrecog-
nizable. This is a key point. I do
not believe that 1 would have been
stopped under the same circum-
stances because I am an easily rec-
ognized physical presence on this
campus, and because I visibly par-
ticipate in a sport. This familiar-
izes me with the campus police
and, to some extent, deletes suspi-
cion. These gentlemen are not
afforded this luxury. I also do not
believe that a nondescript white:
student would have been stopped

failures of integration will con-
tinue. African-Americans must be
treated as equals in order to pre-
cipitate something positive fom the
foul solution of integration. Inmy
three years here in Davidson, too
many people have tried to make
me feel like a second-class citizen.
Very few days have gone by with-
out the subtle suggestion that I

here that Davidson lowers its aca-
demic standards when admitting
minorities. Thus, very rarely am I
treated as an equal on this campus.

Why is this so? My opinion is
that the cause of this is that there
are so few African-Americans and
other minorites at Davidson. In
other words, “token integration” is
the problem. Malcolm X said:
“Token integration takes the place
of the real thing."

Sadly, white America really
does not want trueintegration. She
does not want true integration be-

everything. There is privilege that
comes with being white that I fear
some Caucasians are not ready to
give up. All-Caucasian institu-
tions have better equipment than
all-Affican-American institutions.
Hence, products of all-Caucasian
institutions come out with the best.
When African-Americans go out
on the job market, they are made to
feel less qualified. The suggestion
is made that African-Americans
are inherently incapable of suc-
cess, while the fact that most are
graduates of a corrupt system goes
unnoticed. And this is how Afri-
can-Americans are kept “in con-
trol.” But if Caucasians let Afri-
can-Americans into “their” insti-
tutions, African-Americans would
be equally educated.

I submit that institutions by’

African-American students and
faculty but other minorities (e.g.

think some would have it no other

way.

Lighting Options Need to Be Examined .
& Enacted to Provide Peace of Mind

Light continued from page 11

from a major interstate highway
and a large metropolitan area.
Weare indeed lucky thatcrime
on the Davidson College Campus
is not more widespread than it is.
That is not to say, however, that
there is no fear of crime on cam-
pus, and fear can be as much a
menace as real crime.
Unfortunately, Davidson isnot
as well-prepared as it should be to
counter the threat of crime and the
very real fear of crime on campus.
One glaring example is the inad-

equate lighting on campus.

Good lighting is not the sole
solution to preventing crime—
careful habits are an important fac-
tor as well.

Nevertheless, darkness gives
crime a place to hide and a place
for fears to grow. We applaud the
recentupgrades of lighting oncam-
pus, but feel more is necessary.
There are still many well-traveled
areas on campus that are not lit,
and the potential of the existing
lighting is wasted through the use
of inadequately bright fixtures.

Luckily, better lighting is one

aspect of safety that can be easily

improved.

The number of unlit areas on
campus that require. wholly new
light sources is small, and the ex-
isting lighting (namely light posts)
could be better used by installing
sodium or mercury-vapor light
bulbs, fixtures which are far
brighter than the bulbs presently
used.

The cost of such improve-
ments would be minimal, and when
considering their value in deter-
ring both crime and fear, the costs
are most insignificant.

Davidson Collegestatesas one
of its responsiblities creating and
maintaining the best possible envi-
ronment for students in order to
achieve its educational goals.

In the present day, safety and
peace-of-mind are huge factors in
maintaining that proper environ-
ment.

We hope responsibility for
proper safety will be more fully
recognized and the matter of better
lighting in particular can be ad-
dressed and remedied.
