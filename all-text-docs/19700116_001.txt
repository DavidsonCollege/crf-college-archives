Symposium Asks ,
Man In Control?

Clinical
Counsel

Hired

Davidson College has _ hir-
ed Dr. Meredith Hall as
a part - time professional
clinical psychologist, accord
ing to Dr. W. G. Workman,
professor of psychology.

Hall is currently a clini-
cal psychologist at the Vet
erans Administration Hospi-
tal in Salisbury.

Hall will be available two
nights a week, or perhaps
ofie afternoon and one even-
ing a week, Workman said.
Appointments will be made
through Mrs. Catherine Mil-
son of the Student Counsel-
ing Office.

‘Hall received his A. B.
from the University of
Texas and his MS. from
Virginia Commonwealth Un
iversity. He received-his Ph.
D. from the University of
Maryland.

‘He taught for a short time
at Western Maryland Col-
lege, and came to the Salis-
bury Veterans Administra-
tion Hospital in 1967.

Hall has been a clinical
psychologist at Pfeiffer and
other colleges in the past,
Workman said.

He recently purchased the
old Maxwell Chambers home,
and is restoring it.

He has published a man-
ual and is a licensed prac
ticing psychologist.

Lapp, ’ nu
author, and

critic of national policies in-
volving armaments and
space exploration, will be
keynote speaker © at the
Queens College symposium
“\Man in Control?*’ to be
held 9 and 10.
The Symposium will gon-
sist of two days of speeches,
panel discussions, and _ in-
formal

February

sessions with speak-
ers focusing on several
aspects of man’s struggle to
control science and_ tech
nology. Dr. Lapp will speak
on arms control.

All sessions will be open
to the public. Other panel
topics will include Mass
‘Media and Propaganda; Air
and Water Pollution; The
‘Military - Industrial Com-
plex; The Space Race;
Genetic Control, Birth Con-
trol, and the Population Ex-
plosion; and Control in Po-
litics: Can Capitalism and
Democracy Survive?

Local experts and persons
interested in these problems
will be invited to partici
pate on the panels along
with nationally-known speak
ers.

Dr. Lapp has made news
recently by strongly oppos-
ing the ABM system. He
served as an informal. con-
sultant to ABM opponents in
the Senate, and prepared a
study challenging the ad-
ministration’s claim that the
system was necessary to
protect Minuteman missiles

against Russian SS-1 inter-
continental ballistic mis-
siles.

He ‘has been a
the nuclear arms race,
charging that competition
with Russia is pointless, and
a strong advocate of a mast-
er research plan for sciénti
fic projects of the govern-
ment,

critic of

the same as they were for
previous years.”

Referring to the campaign
sponsored by some Davidson
students to saturate the
freshman class with litera-
ture giving what SGA Presi-
dent Peter ‘Hobbie called
“an objective view with a
negative slant’’ on fraterni-
ties, Herd said that there
was not a way of measuring
any effects the effort may
have had.

“Statistically,
practically no
over last year,’ Herd said.
“There has been some ef-
fect on the minds of the peo
ple down at the court, and
many more people this year
seem to have taken serious
note of the position of  so-
cial affiliate.

Perhaps the major
ence this year has been an
increased overall ‘campus
trend that has certainly not
been pro-fraternity.”’

Hobbie said that in evual-
ating the campaign of rush
literature ‘‘it should be re
membered that our aim was
not to, make Independents.

“T have talked to fresh
men and fraternity men dur-
ing rush, and I am convinc-
ed that we succeeded | in
raising questions about the
system that wifl.° surface
again and again. The results
of our activities will__pro-
bably be really -félt~vhen
this year's freshmen get an
inside look at the fraterni-
ties.”

(Mentioning last year's
freshmen, the first class ex-
posed to a ‘‘look at the other
side of fraternities'’’ cam-
Ppaign, Hobbie pointed out,
“Last year everybody join-
ed, but since the class has
gotten a good look at the
system, ‘it has produced
some: of the most serious

there was

differ-

questioners of the system.”

Hobbie's contribution. to
the printed barrage aimed
at rush this vear was a
booklet entitled ‘‘A Fresh
man's Guide to Rush." He
maintains that the material
used throughout the booklet
was “correct as far as we

Coble,

knew.

“We chose to write it up
in a negative style, how-
ever, to make it more read
able. We knew that the
fraternities would provide
enough of their own slant.to
more than compensate for
anything we did.”

Music critic examines arts in America

Paul Hume Lectures About
U.S. Art’s Financial Crisis

By DAN GRAHAM
Staff Writer

Paul Hume, music critic
for the ‘‘Washington Post,”’
summed up his remarks at
the Wednesday night Rey-
nolds lecture by saying, ‘I
don't want us to miss what is
coming in art because we
can't pay for it.”

The extent of the crisis’in
art, indicated by the 7 mil-
lion dollar deficit of Ameri-
ca's 5 major symphony or-

chestras, is equalled only by
the excitement and the fer-
ment going on in art, he said.
An article Hume quoted
contended that the problem
confronting those working in
music, as well as the other
fine arts, is one of finance
and a rapidly changing cul-
ture: ‘‘the old longhairs don't
support it, and the young
longhairs don't dig it.”

carried out by two Princeton
researchers has pointed out

OPIE

PARRIGIN

pie & Parrigin
Plan Presidential Race

Fine, Rowland, Shoaf
Contend For Editorship

By RUSS MERRITT
Staff Writer

The role of fraternities at
Davidson, the revision of
present trends in student
government, and the office
of the SGA Presidency it-
self appear to be the focal
points in the campaign for
President of ‘the Student
Government Association.

At least this is the im-
pression given in the plat-
forms of each of the three
candidates for the position.

The platforms are as di-

" verse as‘the candidates them:

selves. The trio of candidates
are Tom Opie, a well-known
politician and Vice-President
of the. SGA; Ran Coble, a
crusader for campus re-
forms; and Lyman Parrigin,
a relative unknown’ and by
his own admission the dark
horse of the election.

Opie, ence considered the
protegee of “the out-going
SGA President, Peter Hobbie,
has recently come into his
own as a student leader. As
SGA Vice-President he has
been Resident Hall Council
President, chairman of the
Senate general affairs com-
mittee, and a member of the
executive, educational, and
finance committees.

According to Opie,
been “active in the succes-
ses and some of the mis-
takes of student government,”
and therefore has the ex-
perience that will enable
him to make a unique con-
tribution in the student gov-
ernment,

The theme of Opie’s cam-
paign is the ‘‘quiet
tion.’ According to Opie,
daily open—dorms, —athnight
study in Chambers, and the
new lounges and furniture
in the dorms manifest the
“quiet revolution.”’

“The college has been mud-
dling through long enough
in social and _ educational

he has

revolu-

_ the present

areas,’ Opie said,
impatient for change.”
Opie supports the elimi-
nation of disadvantages of
fraternity sys-
tem. “I feel the one hun-
dred percent bidding  sys-
tem and a_ stronger Union
will help alleviate the fra-
ternity problem.”
Concerning the — student
government and the office of
presidency Opie feels that
many activities that diverted
the president's time and en-
ergy this year, such as ex-

“and Um

“cessive concern with nation-

al issues, should be avoided.
“Student funds should be
used for relevant projects.’
he contended.

Parrigin has had no ex-
Davidson — stu-

perience in
dent politics, yet feels he has
as good a chance in the elec-
tion as either of his oppon-
ents, “fT consider myself the
Phil Hazel of this election,”
he has said. Hazel was the
darkhorse* of last year’s
election, and ran a suprising-
ly close second to Hobbie.

“IT support the fraternity
system at Davidson,’ Parri-
gin states in his platform.
“T am against the trend to-
wards making students feel
they need to excuse their
membership in fraternities.’
Parrigin is the only supporter
of the fraternity system
among the candidates.

Parrigin wants to end the
reign of ‘‘a small group of
students in the student body
who perpetuate only — the
point of view" to the detri-
ment of the majority of the
students.

“The office of SGA Presi-
dent has been inflated be-
yond its intended scope,”
Parrigin says. ‘‘The ‘SGA
President should not have the
power to indulge his per-
sonal—beliefs—unchecked.”*

The third candidate for the
presidency, Ran Coble, says
that the main «thrust of his
ideas are devoted to the

principal that too often stu-
dents are not properly rep-
resented in the student gov-
ernment.
' Coble calls for
resentation in more areas
including on the Board of
Trustees, on the Admissions
Committee, and in depart-
mental meetings.
’ Less academic rigidity is
another item in Coble’s plat-
form. He would like to see
more flexibility coming from
interdisciplinary courses sim-
ilar to Humanities and Uni-
fied Science, a system of self-
scheduled exams which he
has studied as head of the
Educational Reforms Com-
mittee and the establish-
ment of an Experimental
College. R

Another item in Coble’s
platform of concern for the
students is the establishment
of an Ombudsman Panel to
meet once a week and act
on student complaints or
questions.

Coble, currently a_ hall
counselor, has served as pres-
ident of the Belk RHC and
in the SGA Senate as a mem-
ber of the Senate Executive
Committee.

The general format of the
newspaper seems to be the
major concern of the three
candidates for editor of THE
DAVIDSONIAN.

Ed  Shoaf, presently the
managing editor in charge
of news for the paper, hopes
to turn THE DAVIDSONIAN
into an eight-page tabloid
both for news flexibility and
for financial savings.

His major concern is the
proposed radio station and
its impact on news report-
ing..'It_is_my-intention—that
the newspaper should meet
successfully the challenge the
radio station will present to
it,” Shoaf said.

Paul Rowland, an associate
editor for the paper, has
been writing professionally
