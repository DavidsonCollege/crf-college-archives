the first quarter with the score at 9-2, Beta, but, as you
know, that ‘wasn’t the end of the game. The Independents
held the scene for the last. three quarters and won the
game. It was their deterfmination and the Betas’ self-con-
fidence that won the game for them. The Independents
played together, the Betas played individually, and the
upset was the result. I think the Betas realize this so look
out boys they are out for the title. fl ffl fifa

Our game with Cannon “Y” was a great success. It was
our first game and it was our victory. The team did very
well in this starter and most of the student body turned
out for the game. Mayner, White, and Berry played well,
and pushed the team through to win.

But. . there is a great question in my mind. Is Art Hoach
really a good basketball player or was Mrs. Art at the
game? Art really played a wonderful game and it must
be a combination of both. Dagwood was practically the
whole team that night, and he was easily the best player on
the court. (This has been a paid advertisement by Mr.
Arthur Roach):

In the past week of intralmural basketball we have seen
several good games and a great display of skill. To men-
tion one player, Mr. G. Boren. Though the Kappa Sigs
have lost both their games, Gurney has played brilliantly
and has scored about 75 per cent of their points. Since
the first game (KA victory, dern it.) I am here to official-
ly state that to my best knowledge, Bill Wall has not
scored another point. In this game I played the best (only)
game I have played this season. My man, Son Spillman,
one of the greatest players ever to-appear on the court,
scored only two points. Speaking of Spillman, I hear he
went to Winthrop this past week-end. I hope you kept up
the old Davidson spirit, Son. :

Last Monday night I saw our team winits second game
in two starts. White led the attack this time with Berry
and Mayner also among the top scorers, in our 44-35 vic-
ory over Elon. It was a good game and the team won easi-
ly. I hope they keep it up, but Duke and Carolina seem to
be doing pretty well, too. One quote ‘““Watch your kick-
ing!” Tuffy.

This has probably become so monotonous that few are
still reading so thanks to you faithful souls who have
stuck it out. I hereby close.
