Davidson Debaters
Defeat LaFayette

Wins Four to One Decision Over
Pennsylvanians.

Last Friday evening, in the audito-
nfm of the State Normal, at Greens-
boro, Davidson College won a high
honor when her debating team met the
Lakayette team and came off victorious.
It was aclean victory from a worthy op-
ponent, and one of which Davidson is
justly. protid.

The subject for debate was, “Resolv-
cd, ‘Uhat the successful prosecution of
the war requires that all citizens of Ger-
many, Austria. Bulgaria and “Turkey,
now residing in this country, be interned
until peace is secured.”

Messrs. J. R. Woods, J. 1. Fowle and

J. A. Phames represented Davidson, and
debated the afirmative side of the ques-
tion. ‘“Vhe Lafayette team was com-
posed of Messrs. R. W. Chase, C.F.
Fryling and C. D. Smeltzer. ‘Uhis team
had just come from Washington, where
they triumphed over George Washing-
ton University, debating the same side of
the same question; but they were power-
less before the facts. oratory and team
work of our men.
_ The first. speaker ci the evening was
Mr. J. R. Woods, [fe cantended that
one of the most serious problems that
the war has brought to the United States
is that of the enemy alien, and he sought
to prove that it was entirely practical for
our government to effectively intern our
enemy aliens. He then outlined the ar-
guments of the affirmative.

Mr. Chase opened the argument for
the negative bs saving that it would vio-
late the promises of our government to
intern the aliens and that such a course
would mean the taking into custody of
many harmless men in order to get one
harmful man. He predicted that many
aliens, tho friendly before internment,
would seek revenge when liberated.

Mr. Fowle, in a fine speech, continued
the debate for Davidson. He showed the
great amount of damage that has been
done by aliens to property in this coun-
try, and the danger that arises from en
emy propaganda, making it necessary
that the aliens be interned.

Mr. Frvling’s argument was that it
would be very detrimental to our indus-
tries to intern the aliens. He showed
the great number of foreigners in our
industries and quoted authority for the
statement that without foreign labor the
Bethlehem Steel Works and the coal
mines would have to close.

The last speaker for Davidson, Mr.
Thames, argued that internment is just:
that the United States government has
the power to pass any law necessary for
the successful prosecution of the war;
that the use of alien Jabor was very detri-
mental to our industries, and that the
proposed plan was a remeds for the ex-
isting conditions. He closed with a
summary of the affirmative speeches.

Mr. Smeltver argued very forcefully
that the animosity towards aliens was
dve to the hysteria of the times and that
they were often blamed for damage done
by other nationalities, or which comes
in the natural course of events. He con-
tended that the secret service depart-

fantry team from.Camp Greene by ‘a 7

good ball, but their batting was weak
and the fast fielding ot the soldiers cut
down the number ot hits to a minimum.
Only a fair-sized crowd was aut to see

Has Gone to Press

Its Appearance Is Eagerly Awaited
By the Students.

Haste, thee, avmph. and bring with
thee Quips and Cranks.

So said Joho Milton several hundred
vears ago, Ti the grim old Puritan then
greatly desired Quips and Cranks, how
now must his heart rejoice when he
hears that the t918 Annual has gone to
press, Actually pone, and there but re-
mains the touch of the printer's art, and
the vearbook of Davidson will appear,
to spread a smile on the face and glad
nevs in the heart.

Vhe Annual this year promises several
new and interesting features, both in the
pictures and in the material. “Phe Sen
lor pictures are mounted with a new
style ot insert, and have characteristic
snapshots of all Seniors, and the Jumors
do not appear in the same mounting as
Sast vear.  ‘Vhis. deature of different
amounting is also to be seen in the toot
hall pictures. which are gotten out ina
pleasing stvle. Ciermany has caused the
appearance ot ‘the Davidson Batallion,
wich shines forth with all the resplend
ent plory of their grey shirts and wrin
kled puttees,

Not only. is there an abundance of the
photographer's art, but the zinc etchings
wed are more numerous and more clever.
Cartoons are present shawing college life,
and the calendar is illustrated with
drawings.

But it is in the literary departinent
that excellence shows itself. In the bine
oft mere literature the Annual presents
two oor three poems of high — literary
merit. ft also presents some of the best
humor that hag come ouc in the lact fit
teen years. Both in quality and quantity
will this humor appeal to the reader. No
pains have heen spared to make this An-
nual reflect student tfe and student ac-
tivities, even if sometimes it reflects on
both, ‘“Vhe members of the Staff have
furnished, the Quips, and the student
hodv has furnished the Cranks. “Take
the instance: of the Senior write-ups—

ctvle of “Behold the paragow of perfec-
tion” OLA it is true that a hit) student
howls, the Aanual will be a howling
“HECESS.

Much attention has been given. the
bawings. With ther pencils, the ac
tistey of the Annual have portrayed the
features of college life in a manner bath
clever and daughable. “Vhey have con
verted the sine of Grougha into the tan-
vent of “Pee Hee “Laugh and grow
fat." savs the old motto, and the artists
of the Annual, probably realizing that
in these meatless and wheatless days, the
body grows lean and dank, have fur-
nished us with humor in the hope that it
will maintain our corpulency,

Some of the features of the Annual
are: A novel and graphic write-up of
the famous Davidson-Auburn) game: a

given over to military features; a “Hall
of Fame.” where vou may or mav not

tory and writings of the charter chapter
