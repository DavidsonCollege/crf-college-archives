The Scholarship Finalists
Program entertained 37 of
Davidson's top applicants Sun-
day, Monday and Tuesday.

All of these applicants have
been accepted and are now
vying for competitive scholar-
ships, such as the McConnell,
which carry stipends deter-
mined on a need basis.

Each of the competitors, 26
men and 11 women, were in-
terviewed by a committee com-
prised of one member of the ad-

missions staff, two or three
faculty members, and one
student.

They also attended receptions
Sunday night at the Carolina
Inn and Monday morning at the
President's Home. A banquet
was given in their honor Mon-
day night.

The applicants stayed in the

psychology department.

The students will not only ob-
serve the workings of the
hospital—they'll actually work
on the wards for six weeks. in-
cluding two different programs.
such as admissions. general
chronic. geriatric. alcoholic.
token-economy. and adolescent.

They will be involved in a
therapy group and keep a jour-
nal. They will attend three 90-
minute classes per week and
conduct an individual research
project.

Tuition will cost $450
room and board. Each _ will
receive $300 for his ward work
to partially offset these costs.

“This is a strenuous ‘and
demanding program which will
entail some sacrifice of the
usual college amenities.’ said
Dr. Workman. *‘We believe that
the advantages make the hard

work and sacrifice worth-

while.”

“They were impressed by the
friendliness of the people and
the interest which the students
had in them,” Assistant Direc-
tor of Admissions and Financial
Aid William S. Miller said.

“Most of the students also
liked the campus and thought it
compared favorably to others
they had seen,"’ he added.

Miller admitted that the
program is not only a com-
petition but serves as a
“recruitment device” as well.

“These students are the best
of our applicants,” he said.
“They have been accepted at
places like Harvard, Dart-
mouth and Amherst.

‘We would like to enroll all of

we can get at least half.”

Barber Revamps Spring
Theatre Presentations

By FRAZIER MARSH
Staff Writer

This season on the Davidson
campus promises to be quite an
experience in theatre magic.
Rupert T. Barber has turned
the proscenium over to the
students of the Theatre Tutorial
and the Theatre Workshop.

A burgeoning student interest
in drama has caused a change
in format for Davidson drama
productions during the spring
term.

Instead of one major produc-
tion, energies will be diffused
into a steady series of one-act
plays. some original creations
of Davidson students.

“There s sO much interest in
drama now that I can't possibly
use all the available talent in
one production.” said drama
director Rupert T. Barber Jr

Last week the first theatre
workshop production, *‘The

Emigrants’ was presented as
part of the Scandinavian
Seminar.

On Tuesday, April 17 at 7:30
p.m. the second is a series of
five workshop productions will
be presented. The plays to be
given are original one acts writ-
ten by students of Davidson
College.

The plays are being directed
by the students from the Drama
Tutorial class.

“Chicken Soup”, written by
Mary Hobbie, is an_ ex-
perimental piece of drama
which should be quite in-
teresting. It is being directed by
Bob Wright. The cast also in-

-needed for both participants

cludes faces which are new tc
the Hodson stage.

The next production will be an
original written by John Scholer
entitled ‘‘Billv's Life in a Day.”
This play will be directed by
Sarah Hill.

A social comment on the
generation represented by our
own parents, this production ap-
pears to develop into an in-
teresting work.

The last of the plays will be
another experimental drama
piece. The play, *‘Of Trivial Im-
portance’, was written by Bill
Morris and will be directed by
Jeanne Ann Williams.

On April 27 and 28, an old
fashioned melodrama will be
presented several times during
the alumni-convocation
weekend. It will include songs
and dances and will encourage
hissing and booing, Barber
said. Hodson Hall will be
set up as “The Stage Wagon
Theatre” for the occasion.

May | 1s the time for twomore
original plays. “Columns” has
been written and will be direc-
ted by Caroll Ensley.

And “A Look at the Fifties’
will be the production of Frazier
Marsh. Starting time is 7:30
p.m. in Hodson Hall. Only fresh-
men and sophomores will be
performers.

“In all these productions, sets
and costumes will be minimal,”
Barber said. “Ingenuity and
creative imagination -will be

and audience.’

medium.

“The painting is going to be
one large room with different
objects. I don’t want to commit
myself further thanthat. ‘‘The
painting will change as I paint,
part of it will be destroyed by
the motion of the acrylic I paint
with. I do action painting,
where part of the canvas is
destroyed as the paint moves —
destruction-creation, nature of
action.

‘‘T haven't started work on it
since the canvas hasn't come in
yet. I'll have to stretch the can-
vas on the frames — I'll
probably start work on it this
weekend.

“Do you know when the Stu-
dent Art Show is?” Ken
asks a sudden question with a
faint smile. ‘‘Well, it’s toward
the end of the year and the large
one should be ready for it.

“I'm doing the painting for
two reasons. One of them is the
freedom of working with the
large canvas. It’s a
psychological thing working
with a large canvas...the other
is to leave something of me to
Davidson, to all the people who
have helped me here.

“One of the conditions of the
grant is that the painting is con-
nected with Davidson. At first I
thought that working on it here
with the students coming in and
watching would be enough, but
