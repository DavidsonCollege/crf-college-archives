Frolics Poll Shows
Dating Druthers

BY RICK VON UNWERTH
Davidsonian Assistant Editor

Stamina, physical appeal, personality, and at least a
passing interest in sex should set the tone for Frolics
dates, if Monday’s post-chapel poll is any indication.

At least onethird of David- deep-down motivation of a

son's Don Juans expect to imple-
ment the natural environment of
a pollinated Piedmont spring in
their weekend ventures. Sport-
ing romps at Lake Norman will
fill out the weekend for a ma-

majority of the group: “Be-

me well enough to let me
make out with her,” he writes,
expecting a weekend under
optimum conditions.

A good deal of boasting and
some rather ambitious pro-
grams were revealed in the
balloting. if even a minority
of the projected activities pan
out, student exploits could
keep the Executive Commit-
tee, the WCTU, and the Fed-
eral Courts hopping for weeks
to come.

portunity for tongue-in-cheek
drollery, enough incorruptible

The gamut of attitudes ex-

pressed ineluded almost insup-
portable cockiness and dismay-
ing pessimism. “I want a real

reply, “a girl who likes to dance,
swing, drink, grub.”

Some were less exacting,
however, resigning themselves
to insipidity. “She was easy
to contact and would be likely
to come,” said one.

Another equally unenthusias-

the luxury of a handful of edify-
ing generalizations. “Good physi-

nearly 70 per cent of the serious
answers, expressed in varying
forms.

received their bids for a variety
reasons, ranging from the
sublimely pure to the unmen-

the cautious reply on one ballot

Another student aimed for com-
patibility, inviting his date be- drinking

cause “she is fairly good-looking
and has a nasty, sarcastic, dirty
little mind.”
The most ingenious student
by far probably reveals the

cal note of optimism: “She is
very cute-looking, very intelli-
gent, and I did not know anyone
else to ask. (I hope she likes to
raise hell.)”’

Several erstwhile  balloters
called the collective values of
the Davidson student body into
serious question. In defense of
his own platonic approach, one
observer opined that “though I
feel that dance weekends afford
an excuse to get together, I feel
that more than pleasure is
quired to justify the time.’

This view received support in
another reply, accompanied by
an admonition in anticipation of
this survey's findings: ‘Don’t
think that all Davidson students
are looking forward to © this
weekend because there will be
or a possibility of
jibidinal gratification. Some re-
gard this as a good break from
studies and an opportunity for
good fellowship.”

A sobering thought... .

The black Rambler slowly wound its way up the steep ascent mile after curving mile. But finally we rounded the
last curve. Here we were at last, in the late afternoon on top of Grandfather Mountain.

It was the last Sunday in
March. Earlier in the week
Steve, my roommate, and I had
decided to go to the mountains
with dates. The girls had
brought the food: cookies, mints,
apples, marshmallows, and ham-
burgers. And here we were at
last — on the top, alone.

Two large rocks forming a

smoke-scented black hair fell
carelessly around her smooth
forehead and satin-soft cheeks.
Her slightly moistened lips glis-

fire.

“It's so peaceful up here, isn’t
it?” she whispered in a low
tone. “So peaceful. At times like
this it makes you wonder why
there has to be strife, war, de

struction. Why can’t people live
together without fighting?”

lightly on my shoulder. Above,
fleecy clouds tinted pink by the
setting sun slowly glided along
from one horizon to the other.
The silhouette of a blooming
dogwood swayed gently as the
perennial spring breezes con-
tinued their lonesome journey
from nowhere to nowhere. The
reddish-amber light of the fire
caused the barely visible objects
surrounding us to assume both
shape and form.

Paper plates splotched with
mustard and catsup lay scatter-
ed over a large flat rock which
we had used as a table. The

into the spring stiliness.

“Yes, I guess you're right,”
she replied softly. It was as if
we were suspended above the
world of strife, the world of
death, the world of destruction.
For the moment we had escaped
from that world. And a wonder-
ful moment it was. Her head
once again came to rest on my
shoulder. The murmur of the
wind, the barking of an old dog,
and the plaintive coo of a
mourning dove broke the peace-
ful calm.

after a while. “We have to be

to get started. She helped me
put out the fire. We kicked dirt

“Let's leave one coal burn-|:-

e The Fall

Disenchanted Frolies:
A ‘Flying-Horse Folly’

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Spring—the nameless primeval chant, the distant
stomp of a cleft foot, the dimly heard ery of lost revels;

April is the cruelest month.

And about inevitable cruelties
one may easily be maudlin or
bitter, or one may easily try
escape. The rising sap and libi-
do, the recurring and dutiful
cruelty of April we quench in a
flood of Frolics.

To the impartial and the un-
emotional Springless individ-
uals the whole pageant must
seem ridiculous, a gigantic farce,
a flamboyant flyinghorse folly.
The big circle of conventional
coolness moves slowly around,
up and down to the tinsel twang-
ing of Zodiacs and Turchords.
In a dirty corner life may go on,
without the benefit of conven-
tion or disguise, but that is not
important to those grasping af-
ter the elusive brass ring.

The street dance is over, the
after-parties are over, break-
fast and sleep and the Four
Saints are over, goodbye is over
on an intermindable Sunday af-
ternoon—but the madcap ride
continues, and each in his own
way conceals the rebirth of
Spring love-hate in the cruelest

It is time to meve again; so
we hide pillows from the jani-
tors and take down incriminat-
ing evidence from the bulletin
boards, grab a book and six
changes of clothes and leave.

During the frenzied changing
of costume, the room with four
or five people trying to shave at
the same mirror will become a
wild tapestry of T-shirts and
draped trousers.

Return is to an atmosphere of
perfume which may or may not
be recognizable, the re-conver-
sion of dressing table to desk,
and a lone bobbypin on the
window ledge.

But it was great hiding sn the
hot mornings behind window
shades, and groping over insen-
sate bodies to find a towel.
