Dr. J. M. McConnell Makes Ad-
dress at Last Meeting

Four new members were chosen by
the International Relations Club* at
the last meeting on December 6, These
men, who are W. B. McGuire, D. F.
Cannon, S. Y. Brown, and G, A. Fry,
were elected from a number of men
who had been selected to submit pa-
pers last fall. These new members
will be initiated at the next meeting.

The International Relations Club re-
cently secured a number of volumes
and pamphlets on South and Central
American countries. These will short-
ly be placed in'the Library for use of
the students, as they contain much
valuable information, especially on
present day topics.

At the last meeting, Dr. J. M. Mc-
Connell made a talk to the club on
the Kellog Peace Pact, and the Anglo-
French Secret Alliance. Dr. McCon-
nell gave the following facts concern-
ing these topics:

The Kellog Peace Pact is an agree-
ment among the nations of the world
to outlaw war. This pact has been
signed by many of the leading nations
and is being seriously considered by
several other important countries, in-
cluding the United States. The adop-
tion of this treaty will mark a dis-
tinct step towards international peace.
The situation at present is more prom-
ising than it has been any time within
the recent past.

Drama Is Presented
With Combined Cast
At Y. M.C. A. Vespers

Queens’ Y. W. C. A. Aids in Mis-
sionary Play Presented
Sunday

Representatives of the Y¥. W. C. A.
of Queens College and the Y. M. C. A.
of Davidson combined their histrionic
abilities last Sunday evening to pre-
sent to Davidson men the best vesper
program offered by the Y. M. C. A.
this year. Students filled Shearer Hall
to capacity to see them dramatize
“The Color Line,” a one-act playlet
studying the problem of the Chinese
Christian student in the American col-

lege.
The revolt of Chinese © students
against the social ostracism facing

them in America was vividly shown,
a revolt ending oftentimes in the re-
nouncement of Christianity and a re-
turn to the pagan worships of China.
The unfavorable impressions coming
from American indifference to Chris-
tian ideals of personal relationships

were clearly outlined.

‘Those who presented the play hand
led their parts, some of which were

Miss Nancy Vincent, taking. the part
of Barbara McKean, a missionary’s
daughter, and Fred Poag, as Dr, Law-
son, a college president were excep-
tionally good. Miss Elizabeth White

Beatty, as Wanda, a college flapper,
Alan Frew, as Stanley, and Zeb Long,
as Chun, a Chinese student, also took
part in the performance. Zeb Long's

had never appeared before. z

Beginning the trip Monday, Decem-
ber 3, when the Glee Club left, soon
after dinner for Troy, where they were
to give a concert that night, Due to
sickness, and other reasons, five mem-
bers of the Club were unable to maké
the trip, and so one bus and a Chev-
rolet sedan were all that
for transporation.

Immediately after the matinee given
at Flora MacDonald Tuesday, © the
Club left for Lumberton where they
gave a concert that night. Wednes-
day they gave a concert at Elizabeth-
town, and journeyed to Durham
Thursday for the State Contest.

In the State Contest, which was held
Thursday night, the only other col-
leges competing were Duke and Guil-
ford. Davidson’s Club was so small,
its ranks having been greatly depleted
by the flu, that it was only by special
permission that it was allowed to enter
the contest. While Duke and Guil-
ford each entered twenty-nine picked
men in the Contest, Davidson entered
just twenty. Each Club sang the Con-
test song.—F. S. Smith’s arrangement
of Dvorak's “Songs My Mother
Taught Me,” their coHege song, and a
song of their own choosing. David-
son’s Club was no mean oppanent.
They sang as one man for they showed
an almost absolute precision. This
they backed up with a skillful use of
contrast in dynamics and tempo. Guil-
ford’s Club- revealed a tone quality of

a superior type and tempered this
with very good expression.

Under its Student Director, P. B.

cause of its small number, found it
difficult to get the effects desired.

attained with the usual ease, they
seemed less able than usual to bring

hoped that in at least one issue Mr.
Hall would be able to tear himself
away from the gnarled oaks, the oys-

MINISTERIAL BAND
RALLIES MEMBERS

As a result ina recent drive for bet

ter attendance, and shifting of the
hour of meeting from 2:30 to 1:30,
the officers of the Ministerial Barid
were gratified with the largest at
tendance shown at the band during
the past three years. Over fifty mem
bers of the 81 ministerial students
were present at this meeting. It was
decide that officers be elected and
installed flor next semester at. the

meeting next Sunday afternoon, This
meeting will then be turned over to
the discussion of duties to be perform
ed by the band,

Prof. Fleagle spoke at the rally meet-
ing Sunday, advancing suggestions as
to some of the things the Band could
have as an objective towards which
to work, He suggested that the Min-
isterial band could have as its com-
prehensive end, the improvement
the spiritual life of the compus, As
the largest single organization save
the Y. M. C. A., the influence of the
members can be very great. One of the
first things that could be done towards
attaining this end is the encourage-
ment of the students to attend the mid-
week prayer service or to establish
such a meeting among the students.

Another way in which the Band
could be of service was that the mem-
bers could try to influence men who
had not yet decided on their life-
work to enter the ministry. “The cen-
sus of students in the registrar’s office
shows that 142 students have not yet
decided upon their life-work,” said the
speaker. He suggested that the Band
should try to bring these men into the
ministry by discussing it with them
and showing them the advantage of it.

Professor Fleagle suggested in clos-
ing that a study of the problems of the

“Y” Vesper Services

Will Feature Music

|Last Service Before Holidays to
| be Given Over to Christmas
Program

The “Y" Vespers will consist almost
entirely of music on Sunday, Decem-
ber 16. Every part of the service will
be-mtsicalexcept for the responsive
readings. This meeting will be the
Christmas program of the Y. M. C. A.

The Glee Club, Faculty and towns-
people will go together to compose
the program. Several members of the
Faculty and a number of the Davidson
residents will assist the College musi-
cians in their vocal selections. All of
the more popular Yuletide hymns will
be sung.

Camper O'Neal, “Y” Secretary, states
that one of the most interesting and
unusual parts of the Vespers will be the
reading of the Scriptures to music.
Naturally, the’ selection will be one
concerning the birth of Christ.

No definite program has been work-
ed out but one of the most interesting
meetings of the year has been plan-
ned, and everyone is urged to attend.
This will be the last meeting before
the holidays and also the final one in
the year 1928.
