Modest Stillness and Humility: D.A. Thompson
Mistah Kurtz--He Taking Statistics

“Edible Wild Plants!”

If the administration ever
shows the cajones to include me in
one of the brochures they send out
to the high schools, you’ll find
those’ three words under my pic-
ture. While the Pattons, Cunning-
hams, and Covingtons tell their
interviewers about Davidson’s
feeling of community, the oppor-
tunities for growth, and how just
plain neat this place is, I’1I look the
PR guy square in the eye and say,
“Edible Wild Plants!”

That one. phrase better ex-
presses my reasons for loving
Davidson College than could any
drippy speech about the Honor
Code, the Laundry Service, or the
tenured babysitters who help keep
things quiet. Thanks to Edible
Wild Plants, or, as I like to call it,
Foraging for Credit, I can still
graduate from this school without
knowing a damned thing about
science. Under the new curricu-
’ lum, each student must complete
three courses in math and science,
with at least one of those sciences
requiring a lab. Believe it or not,
tooling about the campus on a
sunny afternoon in search of undo-
mesticated tubers actually counts.
Color me pleased. I’ve had an-
other quest to pursue.

With my C+ in Biglogy, my
gifty D in Calculus, and my P in
Physics for Idiots tucked safely
away in my transcript, I have been
able to pursue unfettered my ca-

reer as an English major. I made °

my decision to achieve a degree in
letters at a rather early stage in my
development. My firstrun in with
fractions sealed the vault on my
ever following the life of a banker.
But it wasn’t just my own mathe-
matical ineptitude which kept my
fingers from the abacus, I needed a
spotlight.
Having all my life been cursed

with this terrible penchant for
running my mouth before any kind
of audience, I knew that no matter
how trippingly I said the phrase
“six and three fifths!’ I’d never get
alaugh. Such slings and arrows of
outrageous boredom | could not
suffer. Realizing so soon that my
chances of even landing a night-
job cleaning toilets at NASA were
about as slim as my playing power
forward for the Knicks, I saddled
up my attitude and mosied on over
to the right side of my brain.
There are, of course, those in
high schools across the heartland
who hold my likes in contempt.
They are those base and stupid
little peons who use such hack-
neyed lines as “funny, you don’t
look queer” when they learn of my
interests, or shout “have fun read-
ing!” Don’t worry, I will. But be
sure you enjoy your gym class
now, you wedgee-proffering, fu-
ture wife-beating, one day child-
molesting swine, for I hear chin-
ups and softball aren’t nearly as
much fun in the prison yard.
More pathetic, however, than the
types who hit home-runs and eth-
nics for fun are those who don’t
like English because they can find
no definable “use” for the training.
These Gradgrinds seem to think

that if it’s not useful it isn’t worth .

having. Under their logic, we’d
have to get rid of the SGA, and
who’d want to do that? As if these

folks never carried condoms in their |

wallets. All artis quite useless, but
it beats the hell out of leaning how
to keep track of other people’s
money. I will show you fear in a
handful of accountants.

The world hinges and depends
upon the skills with which every
English major worth his saltleaves
college: the ability to surmise a
situation, to think analytically, to
form a plausible solution, and to

Patterson Court:
The "Den of Sin and Iniquity"Doesn't Have to Be So Bad

By Kirby Shealy

I am sure most of you have
read the report to the President
from the Select Committee on
Alleged Intolerance entitled
~ “Rebuilding Community”. Those
of you reading this Davidsonian
are probably getting a healthy dose
of reaction to that report, specifi-
cally regarding its recommeénda-:
tions for the future of SAE. Well, I
don’t want to make a judgementon
its merits, but I would like to re-
spond toa disturbing undercurrent
of resentment toward Patterson
Court in general and fraternities in
particular that is apparent in its
overall tone.
_ Nowhereis this sentimentmor
"evident in the report than on page
20: “years of benign neglect by the
College authorities have trans-
formed Patterson Court from an
open community of student eating
~ houses into aclosed community of
fraternities and female eating
houses that encourages good
people to behave badly” (empha-
sis supplied). This sentence sug-

gests rather plainly that the exis-
tence of single-sex eating organi-

zations results in the corruption of .

otherwise well-meaning individu-
als. Other parts of the report focus
attention solely on the fraternities
of the Court, as they have been the
scenes of many, if not the majority
of instances of harassment, fight-
ing, alcohol abuse, and general
intolerance in the Davidson com-
munity.

What concerns me most is the
sax widely-held notion that
fraternities are fundamentally bad
organizations that foster attitudes
of exClusivity, intolerance to “‘out-
siders”, and abusive attitudes to-
ward women. This idea could not
be more fallacious. Every fraternal
organization of which I am famil-
iar was founded with the purpose
of upholding some set of lofty
ideals, usually Christian in nature,
none of which includes the afore-
mentioned. Traditionally, men who
join fraternities do so because the

_ ideals that the group espouses are

those that they would like to live

present your ideas with articula-
tion and maybe even a little grace.
In other words: listening fast and.
B.S.ing faster. We very well might
get richer than cheesecake with
these our marketable skills on hand,
but trust me ECO majors, you’ll
never get out of court with only a
fine for being a whiz at Quattro.

The best part about being an
English major, however, is that we
get to be snobs. We really are
terrible. We’re honestly worse
than what you’ ve ever overheard.
We look down on all of the rest of
you Language, Psych., Bio., and
Chem., majors with the mustiestof
tweed disdain, as if we were the
hardest working, most challenged
group on campus. We are, as a
matter of fact, laughing at you, not
with you, most of the time. Why
we think we have any right to such
atrocious behavior is beyond me,
‘cause we don’t really do diddley:

After telling everyone that 495
is difficult and demanding, I'll
admit here and now that we actu-
ally spent the term making fun of
the Political Science Department.
You’d be shocked if I listed all the
dirty words that rhyme with “Ort-
mayer.” Last year in seminar, I
think we spent maybe fifteen min-
utes cracking on Anthropology and
the rest of the time watching Oprah.
It rocked.

This reminds me: Matthew
Armold and Thomas Huxley got
themselves pretty worked up over
this Literature v. Science thing all
the time, and each made several
great points which I’m supposed
to have read for Dr. Holland.
Maybe tonight I’ll settle in with
these Victorians for a hot intellec-
tual debate. Ah, screw it, I’m a bit
tired, and besides, that leggy su-
permodel’s gonna be on Letter-
man.

by, as well (at least that’s how it’s
supposed to happen).

The Kappa Alpha Order, for
example, was founded in the spirit
that certain codes of gentility
should be followed by each mem-

berof the organization. Obligation ~

number IV of a KA brother, as
outlined in its pledge manual The
Varlet, mandates “‘thathe will atall
times conduct himself as a gentle-
man”. KA traces its definition of
genteel behavior back to Medieval
codes of chivalry “with its attrib-
utes of honor, faith, justice, regard
for truth, consideration of others,
reverence for pure womanhood,
and curtesy and good judgementin
everyday actions”. While thismay
sound a bit hokey to some, I think
it is fair to say that KAs are called
to look out for others and act in a
manner that reflects well on them-
selves and does not demean or
degrade those-around them (in-
cluding women, minorities, etc.).
SAE, the object of much of the
criticism contained in the Select
Committee’s report, has, in my

It's Time for

Freedom and
Responsibility (Again)

Last week, a friend who is
considering attending college here
visited--he’s already been ac-
cepted, and the decisionas to where
he will enroll is between Washing-
ton & Lee and Davidson. Answer-
ing his questions, all-the-while

factor which I think could contrib-
ute to the perception of student
displeasure. A friend recently told
me that in her opinion, certain
members of the administration and
faculty were simply hell-bent on
encroaching upon the logistics of

whole truth, and he seemed un-
daunted for the most part, which I
suppose I should have expected.
Davidson, from the outside look-
ing inward, apparently still seems
extremely attractive, for which
there is cause for rejoice in light of
the current goings-on. The rest of
us, though, ought to be seriously
disturbed by the fact that on the
inside, things are a bit more troub-
led as student disenfranchisement
seems to be felt more and more
pervasively.

In previous columns, I have
speculated as to why this trend
seems to be perpetuating itself.
Recently, I’ve noticed another

- opinion, an even better definition

of gentlemanly behavior. Page 23
of The Phoenix, SAE’s pledge
manual, is devoted solely to a
quotation by John Walter Way-
land:

The True Gentlemanis the man
whose conduct proceeds from good
will and an acute sense of propri-
ety, and whose self-control is equal
to all emergencies; who does not
make the poor man conscious of
his poverty, the obscure man of his
obscurity, or any man of his inferi-
ority or deformity; who is himself
humbled if necessity compels him
to humble another; who does not
flatter wealth, cringe before power,
or boast of his own possessions or
achievements; who speaks with
frankness but always with sincer-
ity and sympathy; whose deed
follows his word; who thinks of
the rights and feelings of others,
rather than his own; and who ap-
pears well in any company, a man
with whom honor is sacred and
virtue safe.

On the flip side, most people have
disagreed vehemently with meas-
ures that only a select group of in-
dividuals has mandated.

Terry noted in a recent report, stu-
dents often perceive the directives

contain many of the basic ingredi-

society. What I wish to show is
that fraternities, as institutions, are
not elitist, conformist, racist, nar-
row-minded bastions of masculin-
ity bent on subverting feminism,
authority, and adiversified college
community. In fact, most pledge
to combat these attitudes within
themselves and to serve as good
examples for others.

However, the lofty ideologies
that fraternities stand for on paper
mean: absolutely nothing if their
members do not take them seri-
ously. This, I believe, is a signifi-
cant problem hereat Davidson (and
not just at SAE), one that, if not
eradicated, could mean the end of
fraternities or Patterson Court al-
together. Those of you affiliated
with a house on the court need to
