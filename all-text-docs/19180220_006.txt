SERVICE FLAGS ARE
INCREASING IN NUMBER

A number of college organizations
have shown their patriotism by ‘getting
service flags. These flags have a star for
every former member of that organiza-
tion who is now in service.

The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity has a
flag which has twenty-four stars in it.
The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity has
one which contains thirty stars.

The Philanthropic Society at a recent
meeting voted to get a service flag. It
will contain fifty stars. More stars will
probably be added later, as the investiga-
tion of the records has not been entirely
completed. The flag will be made of
the best material obtainable.

The student body has also ordered a
service flag. It is uncertain how many
stars it will contain, as new names come
in every week. When it is ordered it
will have at least three hundred and
thirty-six stars.

Because of added information, the
name of J. R. Boulware, '21, has been
placed on the honor roll with a grade of

95.1.

REVIEW OF SECOND
ISSUE OF “MAGAZINE”

The second attempt of the “Davidson
College Magazine,” which appeared last
week, contained some very interesting
material. ‘This issue is especially full
of fiction, there being only one essay in
the whole table of contents, and that
inder the rather philosophical title of
“The Vindication of Selfishness,” makes
a strong plea for the Honor Rol] Man.
Of its poems we have two patriotic

poems and a well written ballad of the} ”

“time of de war.” In the cold winter
time a young man’s fancy turns lightly
to thoughts of summer, and two of the
poems bear evidence of that fact. In
fiction, there is Idealized Romance of the
Queen of the Spinning Room, Humor in
On the Road to Florida, Sentiment in
‘I'he Drama of the Ages, Philosophy in
Rose Bushes and Worms, Stirring Ad-
venture under foreign skies in A Tale of
Old Japan, Psychology, Pathology and
Physiology in ‘The Man With the Fuse.

Cumming’s story is a tale that has
held spellbound generations of Japanese
children, and the tale loses none of its
charm by his telling.

On the whole this issue of the ‘““Maga-
zine” is up to the standard both in quan-
tity and quality. It shows that more
students are taking an interest in its pub-
lications, and it shows that these stu-
dents do have to be those with whom we
usually associate the word “literary” in
order to turn out work both interesting
and excellent.

The “Magazine” has received many
favorable comments from its exchanges.
The Emery Phoenix gives it an especially
favorable write-up, while all the review-
ers find more to praise than to blame.
Stone’s article on the Modern Drama,
and Harrell’s story, “In the Past Tense,”
seem to be drawing the most favorable
comments.

Preparations for the Fresh-Soph issue
are well under way, and it is hoped to
put out a “Magazine” up to the stand-
ard. But contributions have not been as
prolific as might be hoped, and if you
see the lines of care furrowing the brows
of the editor, it is not because he has
been sitting up too late reading contribu-
tions. It is rather otherwise. Remem-
ber the good old motto, “It is never too
late to write a story,”’ and see if you
cannot expose your literary ability to the
public in our Fresh-Soph issue. Con-
tributions must be in by March 1,

LIEUT. W. W. MORTON ,

ON CAMPUS LAST WEEK

Accompanied by his mother and sister,
First Lieut. W. W. Morton, ’09, who is
chaplain in 322d Regiment at Camp
Jackson, was on the Hill last Thursday
visiting his brother, T. N. Morton, '18.
Lieutenant Morton reported that he was
pleasantly situated in his work and liked
the chaplainship exceedingly well. He
spoke of the great opportunity that the
chaplain had in being an actual member
of the body of soldiers. He also ex-
pressed himself in hoping that Congress
would immediately pass a bill providing
for three chaplains to a regiment as the
regiments were three times the ordinary
size. He spoke of his work as being di-
vided into four heads. He has one regu-
lar service a week required of him and
can speak as often as he wishes at other
services. He also spoke of hospital vis-
itation, classes for uneducated men in
the ranks, and personal work as falling
under his care. There was a time, he
said, when he was the only Protestant
chaplain at Camp Jackson, but that now
he has some company. He mentioned
W. P. McElroy, ex’t1, and G. W.
Gignilliat, Jr.. ‘15, as being connected
swith the Y. M. C. A. in the camp and
doing good work. Lieutenant Morton
returned to his work after a short leave
of absence on Friday.
