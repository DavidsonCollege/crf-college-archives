FAULK STRETCHES FOR POINT
Senior leads tennis team’s season hopes.

Army Coach Top Choice
As Holland, Conboy Quit

By RUSS MERRITT
Sports Editor

Several developments in
the naming of a head basket-
ball coach for Davidson oc:
curred over the past week as
certain names were dropped
from contention of the posi-
tion and otbers were added
to the list of possibilities.

Perhaps the biggest occur-
rence was the announcement
that both Davidson assist-
ant coaches, Terry Holland
and Jerry Conboy, would not
be available for the head
coaching position.

Holland, an assistant under
Lefty Driesell at Davidson
for the last five years, will
join Driesell at Maryland.

Holland made the decision
to go to Maryland only after
waiting as long as he possibly
could for the Davidson head
coach to be named. Driesell
had offered the position at
Maryland to Holland soon af-
ter he had accepted the Terp
head coaching job.

The only Davidson grad-
uate given a chance of being
named as Driesell’s replace-
ment, Holland was a mem
ber of the Davidson teams
during the Hetzel era. In his
senior year. he led the nation
in field goal percentage.

As a coach. Holland was
popular with both. the players
and the fans. Several of the
outstanding , Wildcat basket-
ballers came to Davidson as
a result of Holland's recruit-
ing.

Shortly before Holland an-
nounced his intention to go
to Maryland. the players on
the next year’s basketball
team said that they would
rather have Holland as head
coach than any other known
possibility. ;

Conboy. a Davidson assist
ant since 1967, decided early

this week to accept the posi:
tion as head coach of Point
Park College in Pittsburg.
Pa.

Considered by many to he
the “brains” of the success-
ful Davidson basketball pro-
gram. Conboy, like Holland,
could wait no longer for Da-
vidson officials to name their
head coach, so he decided to
join Park Point's expanding
program. .

Conboy graduated from
Duquesne University in Pitts-
burg. and as -the only North-
ener on the staff greatly aid-
ed Davidson's northern re-
cruiting.

Before coming to Davidson.
Conboy in nine seasons as a
high school coach had com-
piled a 189-40 record, includ
ing two state championships.

Besides acting as an assist.
ant coach, Conboy was coach
for the Wildkittens. the fresh-
man team.

Along with the two David-
son assistants. two head
coaches are no longer being
mentioned for the head
coaching job. Vanderbilt's
Roy Skinner and Bill Foster
of Rutgers were both consid
ered to have strong chances
for the position a week ago.
but now appear to be out of
the. runnihg.

It had been rumored for

some time that a profession-—

al coach had added his name
to the list of those interested

in the Davidson pesition. but:

until last week it had been
nothing more than rumor.

Over the past week. how-
ever it appeared that Cin-
cinnatti Royal head coach
Ed Jucker had applied for
the job. Jucker, however, re-
fused to verify or deny his
interest.

The most-publicized addi-
tion to the list of candidates

was Army head coach Eob
Knight, who now appears to
be. the top candidate for the
job.

Knight visited the campus
last weekesd and talked to
Davidson officials. A local
radio station learned of
Knight's visit and began to
report that the Army coach
had been offered Davidson's
vacant head coaching job.

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer Jr..
president of Davidson, denied
that any offer had been made
to anyone, including Knight.
Knight himself refused to
confirm or deny the report.

At Army, Knight has dis-
tinguished himself, despite
being limited to compara-
tively short ball players. His
teams have been successful,
playing a dcliberate offense
and tenacious defense.

' This past season the Cadets
under Knight won 20 regular
season games while losing
only five. and were ranked
first in major colleges’ in de-
dense. Army went all the
way to the NIT semifinals,
beating South Carolina in the
process.
