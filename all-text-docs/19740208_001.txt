Model Ill Constitution

Nears Finalization

By MICHAEL TANNER
Editor-in-Chief

The Trustee Governance
Committee is nearing com-
pletion of its deliberations on
the restructuring of the
college’s governance system.
They began in November 1971.

At their meeting Jan. 31, the
committee decided that Model
III as amended is a good
college constitution. They
hope to complete their final
draft within a month and then
submit it to the faculty and
students for their  con-
sideration.

If the faculty and students
have ro major objections and
exp”ess their approval of the
dre cument, it will be placed on
‘he trustee agenda in the
s .

During the January
meeting, the governance com-
mittee, composev. of students,
faculty, administrators and
trustees, resolved several
thorny issues that had held
back the committee’s

progress.

One such problem involved
the function of a
for the faculty. The committee
finally decided to give this in-
dividual the title ‘Vice Chair-
man of the Faculty Pro Tem’’.

His functions would include:
1) serving as tive
of the faculty at trustee
meetings;

2) serving as representative
of the faculty with the ad-
ministration;

3) serving a coordinating
function in the Faculty
Executive Committee;

4) chairing faculty meetings
in the absence of the president
and the academic vice
president or at such other
times as the the president
should designate.

A second involved
the formulation and im-

of six faculty and two studen-
ts, was established which
would advise the president on
general policy.

However, it was decided
that the actual academic
qualifications for admissions
would be set by the faculty.

The committee decided
against students reading ad-
missions folders because of
the time involved and because
of the issue of confidentiality.

The governance committee
has thus completed its line by
line evaluation of Model III
and has made the changes it
felt was necessary. At this
two parts of the
document are incomplete.

One __ section’ involves
academic freedom, and
faculty employment and
evaluation wich are current-
ly being considered by the
faculty and the trustees. The
governance committee ex-
pressed the hope that these
constituencies would come to

an agreement on these issues
as soon as possible so that this
section can be completed.
The second incomplete part
is an amendment procedure,
which a member of the com-
mittee is already drafting.
Unless any other major
disagreement should arise,
the committee will complete
the draft by correspondance
and will not meet again until
the faculty and students have
considered the document.
Governance Committee
Chairman Walter L. Lingle is
already making plans to come
to campus in March to in-
troduce faculty. and students

Model III is essentially a
combination of two earlier
models: the first a campus
assembly and the second a
bicameral system.

Model III defines the

Beer License Feasibility Undetermined

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Managing Editor

The Union can’t give beer
away, much less sell it,"’ com-
mented Assistant Director of
the Union Duff Bruce. He was
referring to the recent ABC
ruling which prohibits David-

son College Union from to

beer to students
during Union activities.

Last Friday, Bruce, Direc-
tor of the Union C. Shaw
Smith, sophomore’ Rick
Roylance, and junior Jud Cut-
tino made a trip into Charlotte
to discuss the matter with
Supervisor for district five of
the North Carolina Alcoholic
Beverage Control (ABC)
Board John Brooks.

Vote Postponed

In its meeting of Monday, Feb. 4, the Educational Policy

grades was discussed and postponed. This proposal would
allow the deletion of a failing grade from a student's
Grade Point Average once the course is repeated and in-

clude in the average only the grade of the repeated cour-

money which was used to buy
the beer came from student
fees. The fact that the Union
had been giving the beer away
during activities did not alter
the situation in the eyes of the
law.

Bruce said that the ABC is
anxious for the Davidson
Union to get a license
beer. He added that
ABC officials will check the
College periodically if they
get a license as they do all
establishments who have
licenses. “In that way we
have the police on our side,”’
Bruce concluded.

However, the Union is not
anxious to do anything about a
license until they move into
Grey Library, which will be
renovated sometime next fall.
Also, the trustees must agree
to acquiring a license, because
they have to sign for it and
must ultimately take respon-
sibility with the ABC board.

“‘Whatour policy willhave to
be until we see the trustees is
that no beer will be supplied
by the Union,’’ conceded
Bruce. He added thatthe Union
will continue to check beer

liquor consumed during Union
activities would probably
diminish. If beer is available
students are not likely to
bring their own beverages.
According to Bruce, it is of
the utmost importance to

a license would not
necessarily put the Union in
the beer business,’’ he said.
‘“‘What we have to do is to con-
vince the Board of Trustees
and the alumni that we're not

‘trying ‘to: get’ ‘imto' the: ‘beer:

business,” he added.

“Getting into the beer
business’’ means that beer
cannot be used as incentive to
attract students to Union ac-
tivities. For example, if a
folksinger is performing in the
Union bar, students should be
encouraged to come for the en-
tertainment and not for the
beer being served.

As an alternative solution,
the Trustees may ask ARA to
obtain a license to sell beer in-
stead of the Union. However,
ARA would sell the product at
a higher price than the Union,
because the Union will not
have to make any profit on the
