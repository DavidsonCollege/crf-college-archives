Wildcats Successful In -

Big Basketball Season

Davidson Basketeers Win Sixteen |

of Twenty-Two Games and Finish
in Second Place

The defeat of Wake Forest, Saturday
night, rang down the curtain of one of the
most successful basketball seasons ever ex-
perienced by a Wildcat basketball team, This
crtshing defeat provided an excellent climax
to so great a season. The quintet fought

and played hard the entire season and con- |
tinued in this fighting spirit until the final ,

whistles of the last game. In the 22 games
played against teams from Georgia to Vir-
ginia the Wildcats won 16, loosing six games,

The Wildcat squad reported at the first
of the season with only one letter-man miss-
ing, ex-Captain Nappy Davis failing to re-
turn. With practically the whole team re-
turning, the squad launched into vigorous
training and practice. The results of this
were shown in the decisive defeat of Con-
cord “Y,” and later. Charlotte “Y" also met
defeat. at the hands of the Wildcats.
games with Duke were annexed after this
and then the team journeyed to Carolina to
be defeated by the Southern champs by a
large score. Returning home the team won
from Elon and again defeated Concord “Y.”
A trip to Duke followed, the Methodists be-
ing defeated for the third time. Two de-
feats followed this victory, one at the hands
of Wake Forest, the other administered by
the Durham Elks. But in the return game
with the Elks the Wildcats defeated them.
A return game with Charlotte “Y” resulted
in defeat, but after this the team won four
straights, beginning with High Point at
Davidson.

In one of the high spots of the season, the
Davidson team defeated Georgia Tech in a
fast game at Charlotte.’ This was the first
time Davidson and Tech had met in an Ath-
letic contest in two years. Beginning the trip

through Virginia, the Wildcats, on their way |

up, turned back Guilford and ran up the
highest score of the season,
the next victim for the team. The Tech
boys were unable to stop the Wildcats’ flashy

pass-work,. Washington and Lee downed the |

Wildcats for their fifth defeat of the sea- |
son, but on recovering from this, they turned |
down Hampden-Sidney and Roanoke.
Returning from the Virginia trip to play |
Wake Forest in Charlotte, Davidson went
down in defeat for the last time of the sea-
son.

The good work of |

Sport Flashes

By DON WHARTON

Closing each athletic season in a blaze of |
glory has just about become a habit at Da- |
|vidson. Last fall the victory over Trinity

on the gridiron, then the victory over North |

Carolina on the wrestling mat, and finally a
decisive win over Wake Forest on the bas-
ketball court seems to be a good start toward
making this a tradition at Davidson.

Davidson truly had a five-man quintet. To
| pick out one man on it, and say that he is the
outstanding player would be unpardonable
favoritism.

Although Captain Boggs, playing at guard,
didn't do much scoring throughout the year,
his work was of highest order. He is recog-
nized throughout North Carolina as the
greatest standing guard of the State. His

ability to outguess the approaching forward,’

to break up the. passing attack of opponents,
his dribbling and pass work all combine to
create a guard of all-state calibre.

Spee McConnell, the other. Wildcat guard,
made an ideal running mate for Boggs. Time
after time and game after game it was Mc-
Connell who furnished the spectators with
glimpses of the prettiest form possible. He
scored over a hundred points.

Anderson's feat of scoring 219 points or
an average of 10 points per game, was one
of the biggest of the season.

Staley and Laird vied for second honors in
scoring, Staley nosing out with 177 to Laird’s
163 points. They made a great combination.

In spite of Wake Forest having defeated
the Wildcats two out of three games, it is
interesting to note that the Wildcats piled up
a total of 112 points in these thre encounters
to Wake Forest’s 109.

However, it’s not to any of the regulars
nor the substitutes that the greatest honor
lend appreciation is due—Coach Monk was
the man that developed the team that won 16
|out of 22 games and by a percentage rates
' second in the State.

|COX ELECTED TO CAPTAIN
WRESTLING TEAM IN 1925

Frierson Will Manage Matmen on
Big Schedule During Next Year

The Wildcat wrestlers will be led during
the 1925-26 season by W. D. Cox, and man-
jaged by Joe Frierson. These men were
elected at a meeting of the team held last
Saturday morning.

Cox, who wrestles in the 139-pound class,
has completed his second season on the team.
During the past season he has won three
matches, all of falls, and has lost twice on
time. In the Carolina meet-he won the only

man and seldom allowing him to shoot. |
“Speck” McConnell also played well at
guard.

FRIERSON SHOWS UP FINE IN
' FIRST SEASON ON MAT

Joe Frierson, who has gained a widespread
reputation as a
wrestling mat, made his debut in the Con-
cord “Y" match when he won his match by

_a fall in one minute 32 seconds, and he also
| won on a fall in the return match.
|N. C. State match he again won on a fall. |
In the next meets he won with large time |

advantages, the time in the V. P. I. match |
being five minutes and 46 seconds, and in the |
| Carolina match his time was five minutes

|Coach Tilson Busy With |

Cinder-Path Candidates.

| Wildcat Track Preepests Are Bright |
For Coming Season—Many Vet-
erans Report for Practice

|

This is the first year in three or four that |
we have had a coach to devote his attention |
to developing a real cinder path squad, and |
the following men, under the direction of |
Coach Tilson should prove strong contestants
|

In the 100, 220, and 440, are Brand, Gpody- |
koontz, Matthews, and George Smith. Brand

;and Goodykoontz are showing up fine in the
| .
early practice.

Matthews and Smith have
been on the squad in the past and are show- }
ing up well, and are likely to give someone
a tussle for a berth in the dashes,

Spec McConnell, in the mile race, holds
the college record and intends to uphold this
honor and defend his title against all comers.
McConnell will probably run the 880 also.

Parker is showing up well in the 440 and
880. Though lacking in experience, he |
shows promise, and the team will have a
valuable man in him with the proper training.

Buck Shaw is working and training hard
in the 880 and promises to give someone a}
good race in this event.

In the two-mile race aré Williford and
Webb, both doing good work. Williford,
who made his letter last year, shows good |
ability and has a good stride. He will prob-
ably prove a consistent winner on the team |
this year. /

Red Anderson, in the pole vault and high |
hurdles, made his letter last year for the first
time. He showed up well in these events
last year and ought to make things hum gai
any contestants this year.

Red McComb is the ex-record holder with
the javelin. He once held state record for a
moment, but it was snatched from him by his
formidable antagonist, Carter, of State. Mc-
Comb made his letter in this event in both
his Fresh and Soph years, and is expected
to give strong opposition this year both to
his opponents and his team-mates who seek
to win a letter in this event.

In the broad jump, C. C, McMillan is
working hard. He made a splendid showing
in the class meet last Easter, on the strength
of which he made the Virginia trip and the
State meet. McMillan showed marked abil-
ity, and with hard work and coaching may
prove a valuable man to the team.

Captain Gracy, in the high hurdles, jave-
lin, shot put, and high jump, is showing his
usual good form. Gracy is the mainstay of
the team and will be a hard man to beat. He
will probably pole vault also.

The neucleus around which the team will
be built are the following five letter men:
McConnell (2), Williford (1), McComb
(2), Anderson (1), and Gracy (3). The
team will enter five meets this year: Clem-
son, V. P. I., South Carolina, Wofford, and |
the State mect.

fall of the evening, defeating Vick, of Caro-
lina.

Frierson, although only a Sophomore, and |
on the team for the first year, has made quite |

. Ps . . |
a name for himself in wrestling circles. He |
has been hailed as the successor of Cro-|
martie, Davidson’s wrestler supreme. Of |

six starts Frierson won five, only losing to
Slaven, of Navy, by a margin of 10 seconds
when the match went into an extra period.
While the season was not as bright as in|
‘former years, the Wildcat grapplers showed |
up well. In the four collegiate meets held, | |
the Wildcats broke even, losing to Navy and |
V. P. I., and defeating Carolina and State. |
Cancord Y. M. C. A. was also defeated twice. |
