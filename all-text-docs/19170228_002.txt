“College ties can ne'er be broken,”
especially football ties.

More agony is wrought by speaking
than this world dreams of.

What is the difference between the
man who takes a light out of a Society
Hall, and any other thief?

It’s queer that some men will pay to
be taught in expression, and yet the
Freshmen who get the training for noth-
ing, dread it. Can that be an argument
for more optional work?

HEAR THE SPEAKING.

A Junior or Senior Speaking repre-
sents a lot of work, not only in writing
and learning the speeches, but in gather-
ing the necessary material and informa-
tion. Each of the sixty-seven speeches
lately composed bv Juniors speaks of
hours of research work and much
scratching of the head in order to put
the acquired material in logical and pre-
sentable form.

One‘of the main purposes of such an
occasion is that the speakers themselves
should receive the information which this
research brings, for each speaker becomes
almost an authority along the line of his
subject. If this is so, certainly it would
profit anybody to hear sixty-seven
authorities speak on about the same num-
her of different subjects, to hear concen-
trated into a few minutes the informa-
tion that has been hours in the getting.

So for ‘personal benefit and education,
if for no other reason, we hope a larger
number of students than has heen the
custom will attend the speaking.

PROF. WOOD RETURNS.

Prof. W. W. Wood is again on the
Hill at work. Professor Wood has been
recuperating at his home in Charlottes-
ville, Va., from a severe illness, which
forced him to give up his work here.

His many friends in the college and
town are very glad indeed to have him
hack again.

DR. MARTIN ATTENDS
LAYMEN'S CONVENTION

The Laymen’s Missionary Movement
held its fifth general convention in Lex-
ington, Ky., on the 2oth, 21st and 22nd
of February. Dr. Martin was elected as
presiding officer. “The hospitality of the
local committees, together with the good
weather, made the convention a great
success. Three conferences were held
each day, in the morning, afternoon and
evening.

The convention opened Tuesday aft-
ernoon, February 20th. Dr. Muller,
pastor of the First Church of Lexing-
ton, made the address of welcome. This
was followed by the response by Dr.
Martin. On Tuesday evening Dr.
Homer McMillan, an alumnus of Dav-
idson, made an address on “America’s
Duty to the Needv Home;” Rev. P.
Tames Bryant (colored), pastor of the
Wheat Street Baptist Church, of At-
lanta, which has a membership of 5,000,
made an address on “How Can_ the
Church of the South Help the Negro
Churches?” This was one of the best
addresses of the convention. Altho what
he said was verv keen, he softened it
with his wit and sense of humor. Rev.
R. O. Flynn, father of Emerv Fivnn,
"tg, made an address Wednesday after-
noon on “Did Tt Pay My Church to Do
Relief Work?”

The great topic. “The Work of the
Probation Court.” was discuseed on
‘Wednesday evening. Rev. G. R. Bu-
ford, who was killed in Atlanta Satur-
day. was to have delivered an address
Weinesday evening in “The Methods
T Am Emoloving to Take Advantage
of the Opportunities Afforded Mv
Church Thru Community Agencies.”
The incomplete notes of the message he
was to have delivered -to the convention

were found on his desk. Dr. Ogden.|.

nastor of the Central Presbyterian
Church of Atlanta, delivered a verv im-
nressive address from them and on the
historv of his life. W. S. Rovster, a
Davidson alumnus, now in Norfolk.
Vadelivered an address Thursday aft-
ernoon on “The Mateer of Consecrated
Means.” The convention closed on
Thursdav evening with an address bv
Rev. D. T. Burrell. pastor of the Marble
Presbyterian Church. of New York. on
the tonic, “The Leadership of the Holy
Spirie”.

The total number of registered dele-
gates at the convention was 1,150.

JOINT SERVICE HELD
SUNDAY EVENING

The Christian Endeavor Society,
Ministerial Band, and the Volunteer
Band met as one body last Sunday even-
ing. At this meeting J. R. Woods and
P. B. Price outlined the plans for the
coming meeting of the Volunteers of the
North Carolina colleges, to be held at
Greenshoro, March oth, roth and 11th.
They also spoke of the good that had
been derived from the meetings held the
last two vears and urged all who pos-
sibly could, to attend.

J. G. Patton, '16, next gave a very

interesting talk urging all students tol f
use their time to the best advantage] ¥

while in college. He showed from his

text, John 11:14, that we were all dead} &

in trespasses and sins, and the best way
to do the Lord’s work and to wake the
world to the realization of this sin, was
thru conscientious work at college.

NOTICE.

J. C. Paisley. 't7, has found it neces-
sary to resign from the position of cir-
culation manager of THe DavIpsoNnIAN.
owing to heaviness of class work. and
until the regular election, the assistant
managers will have charge of the office
work.
