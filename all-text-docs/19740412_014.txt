TIME OUT

MARK WILENSKY

No sooner do I sound off, than Jeff Frank signs
the top high school tennis player in Florida.

Nonetheless, the fact remains that shooting for a
top player without a scholarship to offer is like
climbing up a down escalator. You might even-
tually reach the top, but think how many people
glide easily by you as you Struggle.

As Frank said to a DAVIDSONIAWN staffer, ‘‘J
don't Know why he came here. Bondurant could
have gotten money most anyplace else.”’

Bondurant is a tremendous personal coup for
Frank and a great boost to his progam. Un-
fortunately, his signing could do as much harm as
good. College officials are liable to point to Bon-
durant and claim a revival of the old Davidson
mystique.

As long as I’m lobbying for a revamping of at-
titudes within the athletic department and on the
Davidson sports scene, let me take a swipe at the
Sports Information Office. It’s the middle of spring
and still the only press releases sent out concern
the signing of football and basketball prospects.

Wildcat teams are now competing in track, ten-
nis, baseball, sailing, rugby and golf. Let’s give the
people playing these sports some attention too.

Spring football practice is underway and the
players seem to be working at least as hard and en-
joying it more. Having a realistic chance to win will
do wonders for a team’s morale.

S i of football, the talk continues of
Charlotte landing a World Football League fran-
chise. Can anyone remember the last time there
was a new sports league and Charlotte wasn’t con-
sidered for a franchise?

If rumors were fact, Charlotte would be a

optimistic’’ about the coming
years for the tennis program
here.

‘“‘Brian has excellent tennis
credentials,’’ Frank praised,
‘and he is really going to help
our program in the next few
years.”’

In conference competition,
the Cats have three singles
players who are thus far un-
defeated. Quinby leads thetrio,
followed by Steve Holman at
the fifth singles and John Mit-
chell at number six. Allen and
Quinby are also unbeaten at
the top doubles slot.

Getting back to the Pfieffer
match, there was really very
little competition for the Cats,
as they won all the matches in
straight sets. Allen had some
problems at the top singles
spot. but came through with a
6-3, 7-6 victory.

Quinby totally anihilated his
opponent with a handy 6-0, 6-0
win, while Bressler took the
third slot, 6-1, 6-1.

Scoot Dimon won at four, 6-
2, 6-3, along with Holman and
Mitchell capturing the lower
two singles spots by identical
6-0, 6-0 romps.

Bressler and Dorsett won a
good match at the top doubles
position, when Frank pulled
Allen and Quinby out of the
match. Holman teamed with
Bill DuPont to capture the
second doubles, as Mitchell
and Dimon won at the final
doubles post.

The Cats will travel to
Virginia Tech on Friday and
move on to VMI Saturday for
their fourth conference en-
counter.

The two matches should ser-
ve mainly as warm-ups for the
big battles with Furman and
Appalachian.
