in Durban, South Africa to
end the black against black
fighting and to “take your
guns, your knives, and your
pangas and throw them into
the sea. Close down the death
factories. End this war now!”

In another speech in Johan-
nesburg, Mandela reopened
a debate about South A frica’s
economic policy. He claims
that the capitalist structure

poor, the black and the white

Once South Africa is rid of

Clement Radebe, a sopho-
more from South Africa,
Stated that his nation has en-
tered a new phase of the
struggle against apartheid
that represents a return to
oppositionist policies of the
1960's, which concentrated
on negotiation with the gov-
ernment and no use of ag-
gression.

. been released, and Clement
hopes that the government
will respond positively to his
efforts at starting
“negotiations with the ANC,
Radebe emphasized that the

In the end Chamorro won
with approximately 54 per-
centof the vote and Ortega ad-
mitted his defeat and relin-
quished his post to his rival. If
Ortega had refused to allow
Chamorro to become Presi-
dent, he would have further
jeopardized already strained
relations between the United
States and Nicaragua.

President Bush claimed
prior to the. elections that if
Ortega won, he would not
guarantee closer ties between
the two countries. Ortega, the
leader of the Sandinistas, had
been in power since 1979
when the Sandinista National
Liberation Front dismissed
US supported President So-
moza from power.

Asmanyas 90 percent of eli-
gible voters were expected to
cast ballots in the
election.Overall this creates a
volatile situation that could
result in violence.

Campus crime corner

False alarms, van-
dals infect campus

By GIRISH GVALANI

eA wallet was reported
missing from the room of
David Campbell on fourth Belk
two weeks ago. It contained
$20in cash, Campbell's driving
license and credit cards. It was
assumed that Campbell had
mislaid it but he said he was
pretty sure he had left it in his
room and later found it miss-
ing.

°A bicycle was reported sto-
len from in front of Richardson
during the same week. It is a
red mountain bike and is val-
ued at about $200. In addition,
about $70 was reported miss-
ing from a wallet in a coat left
hanging in Vail Commons
during lunchtime that day.
Police said that no one is under
suspicion as yet for all the
above incidents.

eOn Patterson Court, a 25"
television set was reported sto-
len from the BSC two week-

endsago. The policeas yet have

no leads.
°Two cases of vandalism by

students were reported on
Sunday. Some students broke
open the fire extinguisher box
and sprayed foam on West
fourth Belk, setting off the
smoke detectorsand fire alarm.
Another false alarm was set off
30 minutes later in Watts.
There wasa real alarm though,
set off in the senior apartments
by burning food.

Chief Jackie Hughes said that
the entire situation was “hard
on the voluntary Fire Depart-
ment” and that “they were get-
ting upset at the number of
false alarms.”

On a more positive note, he
stated that this year’s pledging
activities caused no “serious
problems” as compared to pre-
vious years.

There was a reported case of
vandalism on March 3 caused
by a fight between two stu-
dents. The windowpanes on
the front door of Cannon were
broken by one of the students.
The case has been reported to
Dean Will Terry.

Recycling tip
o’ the week

Intelligible, sensible; do-able and |
only slightly inconvenient ideas
for the Davidson College Student

STOP DRIVING EVERYWHERE! Does Davidson have
such a large campus that walking (or biking) to class
requires an exhaustive physical effort? Are we too weak
to carry our laundry on foot? Do we really not have time
to walk to the post office? Is it slightly irrational to drive
to the Baker Sports Complex so we can exercise?

It has been estimated that each gallon of gasoline we
burn in our car engine produces 18 pounds of atmos-
phere-damaging carbon dioxide plus other harmful
emissions. If 1 percent of American car owners left their
cars idle for one day each a week, 42 million gallons of
gas per year would be saved and 840 million pounds of
carbon dioxide would be kept from the atmosphere (The
Earth Works Group, 50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save

Let’s use the best technology available to us (our

intelligence, not our automobiles) to realize that driving
around Davidson is in most cases unnecessary, destruc-

After close call, Davidson JYA in Montpelier,
program remains intact

By GIRISH GVALANI

Due to problems in renewing the
contract Davidson has with the Univer-
sity of Montpelier, the future of the
junior year abroad program in France
appeared to be in jeopardy.

According to Homer Sutton, coordi-
nator of the study abroad program and
associate professor of French, French
universities had to admit over 100,000
students in excess of their capacity. Asa

result, most universities found them-
selves severely under-budgeted. One of
these universities was Montpelier.

Sutton said one measure adopted by
Montpelier to ease the strain on their
budget was to try tochange the terms of
the JYA contract it had with Davidson.
According to Sutton, if the new contract
had gone through, it would have cost
Davidson several times more per stu-
dent than it had cost previously. Sutton

said that attempts to negotiate with
university officials were not successful.

One possible solution was to shift the
center of the program to Tours. This
plan seemed feasible enough until Sut-
ton, who was in Tours trying to negoti-
ate the contract, ranintoan unexpected
snag. According to Sutton, a faculty
member at the University of Tours suc-
ceeded in convincing the administra-
tion that Tours should give priority to

French students: especially since
French universities were unable to
admit all deserving candidates at that
time. The JYA program seemed to have
reached a deadlock.

But Montpelier suddenly gave in and
agreed to renegotiate their terms. No
explanation was given for the change in
position. A new contract was drawn up
and the center for JY A in France remains
in Montpelier.
