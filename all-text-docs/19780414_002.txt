At the recommendation of the
Educational Policy Committee
(EPC), the faculty voted to
disallow transfer credits from
junior or community colleges
for juniors and seniors.

Vice-President for Academic
Affairs Price Zimmermann ex-
plained, “Junior colleges and
community colleges offer junior
level and introductory level
courses. There is equivalency
between the first two years, but
thereafter courses are not equi-
valent.

‘‘Why would a Davidsgn
student want to compromise on
his education and take a lower
level course?” :

Zimmermann added, ‘‘If
there are compelling reasons for
a junior to take courses at a
junior college, the Curriculum
Requirements Committee will
consider exemptions.”’

This action, taken on April -

11, is only one of five changes
approved by the faculty regar-
ding transfer credits. A revision
in the wording changed the
transferred grade from at least
‘‘comparable to a Davidson
grade of ‘C’”’ to ‘‘a ‘C’ or its
equivalent.’

Another addition stated
“that any courses completed in
the summer session of another
college or university must be
reported to Davidson on an
official transcript by the follo-
wing November 15.”’

The limit for the number of

transfer credits Davidson will
allow was specified to be ‘‘no
more than one-half of the cour-
ses used to satisfy major re-
quirements, and these must be
approved by the department of
the major.”’

Earlier policy had set no
specific maximum number.

One final alternation states,
‘‘No more than two courses
failed at Davidson may be
credited later by transfer from
other colleges or universities."

now being built behind the Center for Special Studies, he said that he was influenced by the
Center’s design. That's the reason for the widow's walk on top. Meetze hopes the building will be

finished by September.

“In an effort to get the PAC’s
approval for us to have a copy
of the document I sent Charles
Erwin (a staff news reporter) to
speak to Dr. Wolf.”

Erwin testifies that at a
meeting with Wolf on March 28
Wolf strongly stated that he
would not release the document
for publication that week. Er-
win acknowledged passing this
information to Duncan.

“I told Charles myself in the
phone conversation that I

would talk to Dr. Wolf myself’

and try to persuade him to let
us have a copy of the code.”’

attempts to call Wolf but he

“Since we could not reach Dr.
Wolf I talked to Brown Patter-
son (Professor of History) the
secretary of the PAC. From
that meeting I received the
impression that the PAC did
not mind us having a copy of
the code as long as it was not
identified in the article as
something they had voted on or
dealt officially with in any
way.”

Patterson testified that he |

told Duncan that the members
of the PAC would have to read
and discuss the document be-
fore it could be released.

“T thought that Zimmermann
and Spencer ree us to have
a copy of the céde and I thought
the PAC wanted us to have a
copy of the code so long as it
was not identified as their
document. Since both sides
seemed willing for us to have a
copy of the code but neither
wanted to release it to us, I
thought we could get a copy and
use it. That is why I did what I
did.”

In reference to this hesitancy
to release the document, Wolf
testified ‘I thought it would not

draft to appear in The Davidso-

Ronal Stenning, national di-
rector of CROP, will be the
featured speaker at this year’s
World Hunger Symposium on
Wednesday, April 19. The
Symposium will begin with a
share-it-with-your-neighbor
meal at 5:30 in the fellowship
hall of DCPC. "

At 6:30, Stenning will speak
in the 900 Room on problems
facing the fight of world hunger
and on CROP’s work in that

area.

Following his address, Sten-
ning will join other speakers in a
panel discussion on various
aspects of hunger. Panel mem-
bers include Professors of Eco-
nomics Ernest Patterson,
speaking on economic consider-
ations, and Coty Pinckney,
speaking on the feasibility of
meatless diets in a hungry
world.

Tuesday ie
“It would bé beneficial to get

a draft published at some point/

in The Davidsonian so the
community at large could dis-
cuss the issues....This was just
not. the time for publication.”’

Defense advisor Harry
Greyard summed up his argu-
ment by noting ‘‘There were
two completely different mind
sets surrounding the release of
the code. It was an unfortunate
series of misunderstandings by
which Phil was misled and
confused.”’

“I vehemently believe this
code should be brought out in
the open and Phil had an
obligation to get the code before
the campus as soon as possible.
I think I should say again that
we are pleading guilty. We are
not denying anything...There
are extenuating. circumstances
present that should be consi-
dered in levying a sanction.”

Greyard then called for the
imposition of Censure as a fair
penalty.

Watford, in closing the case
for the prosecution, felt a
stronger punishment was called
for. ‘‘I agree that a great deal of
the case before us was brought
about by confusion. Yet, it is
not the paper’s right to take
information. It would have been

On Thursday, April 20,
World Food Day, the campus is
asked to participate in a symbo-
lic fast to help in the fight
against hunger. Representa-
tives from Davidson CROP will
be canvassing and participating
students are urged to donate all
or some of the money they
normally would have spent on
meals that day.

All funds from the fast will go
to CROP, the community hun-
ger appeal of Church World
Service (CWS). CROP works
through community organiza-
tions nationwide to raise money
via canvassing, hunger walks,
fasts, bake sales, etc. and to
collect donations of clothing
and blankets.

CWS uses these funds world-
wide for direct relief, family
planning, technical assistance,
emergency relief, appropriate
technology. and other programs

different if the information had
been leaked...Journalistic moti-
vations and zeal should not
have overshadowed basic moral
issues.”’

‘Our reason for changing
from an Honor Code charge to a
Code of Responsibility charge
was that it was not Phil's
motive to steal. We wanted to
show that we were not out for
blood.”’

‘‘Above all, we wanted to
show that the Code of Responsi-
bility guards those faculty
boxes. There is no reason that a
document in there should ever
have to be sealed in an enve-
lope.”’

“The faculty as well as the
students are very concerned
with this case. Its. result will
have a strong influence on the
effectiveness of these two codes.
The degree of trust in them is
fragile and a mild decision
would be viewed by the entire
college as debilitating to the
codes.”’

CROP schedules Symposium

of hunger while alleviating its
symptoms.

CROP and CWS are non-de-
nominational and non-political
in their approach; last month,
for example, CROP sent a
shipload of grain to orphanages
and children’s hospitals in
South Vietnam.

At Davidson, CROP func-
tions as a fund- and con-
sciousness-raising organization:
its primary program is the
Tuesday CROP lunch, in which
simple food (beans, rice, corn-
bread, etc.), donated by ARA-
Slater, is served in return for a
75 cent donation. The annual
symposium is its other program
at Davidson, although it also
receives money from cups saved
through the Bring-your-own-
cup drive at Slater.

Davidson CROP is one of
several campus branches in
North Carolina, and is the most
successful in terms of money
collected.
