A NEW LOOK

Look for something different tonight when the Wild-
cats battle Catawba. Davidson’s football strategy has under-
gone a basic change since last season.

Last year Davidson boasted the number one and
number four passers in the Southern Conference, the
number one pass receiver, and the number one passing
offense. Even though the same throwing and receiving
combinations are intact, the Cats will not be striving to
set more aerial records. ;

Fred Russell, in a Saturday Evening Post article one
week ago, observed, ‘Foot soldiers are taking over football.
The college game of 1956 promises to glorify the hold-on-to-
the-ball infantry to a degree unparalleled in modern play.”
Davidson, in line with the national trend, is shifting more
emphasis to the overland attack.

However, unlike several of the major teams, the Cats
will not abandon passing but will search for a healthy com-
bination of the two types of offense.

BALANCE iS A MUST

Coach Dole, commenting on the change, said, “Last year
we were known as just a passing team because our running
attack was hampered by a lack of blocking. No team is good
unless balance is attained.

Dole added, “The running must complement the
passing and the aerial attack must compensate the
ground game. We are striving for a balance of attack,
and if we can develop a running offense we will be a
better team.”

Summing up the advantages of such a strategy, Dole
said, “The running draws the defense in and the passing
loosens the defense up. If we can instill in our opponents
indecision as to what to look for, we can play better foot-

ball.”
FOUR TOP LINEMEN LOST

Such a change in tactics might not be anticipated by
those who point to the fact that most of the players graduat-
ing last year came from the line. Owens, Davis, Llewellyn,
Abernethy—all mainstays of the '55 forward wall—will be
missing from this season’s roster.

The ‘56 line, though rather inexperienced, is
tough, primarily because of excellent conditioning.
Pride Ratteree, the new line mentor, has worked his boys
extremely hard.

In the backfield experience is abundant. Dole has two
complete sets of senior halfbacks and quarterbacks. At the
halves, all three of the “Dons’—Campbell, McRee and
Comer—have been running well.

McRee, the ‘55 leading ground gainer, broke away
for several long gains in last Saturday's scrimmage.
Conger, who was out last week with a knee injury, is
back in action. Quarterbacks Belton and Little look
good as ever.

Starting at fullback will be John G. Francis who gained
again and again Saturday by getting through the holes
quickly. Backing him up will be the much heralded fresh-
man, Dave Warden, whom Wildcat fans are anxious to see
in action. The 210-pound newcomer will add needed weight
and power to the backfield.

Catawba’s massive line should be a good test for David-

son’s New Look.

DAVIDSON, N. C.

‘ootball rushes in at 8:00 p.m.,
tonight in spacious Memorial Sta-
dium on the heels of Davidson's
fraternity rush program. In their
opening game, the Wildcats will
be hosts to the Catawba Indians,
whom they beat last year by a
score of 26-0. A much closer game
is expected tonight.

One reason is that from tackle
to tackle, Davidson will spot
Catawba an average of about 40
pounds per man. Davidson's start-
ing backfield will be light since
John Francis has replaced Warden
as starting fullback. The Cat back-
field, of Francis at full, McRee
and Conger at halves, and Belton
at Quarterback will average less
than 170 pounds.

Harold (Westy) Westerveldt,
the surprise of the year for
the Wildcats, will start at left
end. The scrappy sophomore
is the smallest end on David- |
son’s squad and undoubtedly
one of the smallest in the Con-
ference. |
David Fagg, who has been the|

outstanding lineman in scrimmage |
thus far, is at the left tackle post, |
and Charles James, a sophomore
will be the left guard |

Bill Price has been moved back
from end to center, the position
he played last year. Dale Gramley,
will start at the other guard slot
beside big Tom Lee at right tackle. |
Sophomore Craig Wall at right
end fills out the starting line up

Bill Gramley, brother of Dale,

is expected to see plenty of action
Bill led Southern Conference pass
receivers last year. Dave Warden,
freshman fullback, will be used to
add weight and power to the back
field.

Preps For Big Season

The Davidson cross-country team, |
outstanding representatives of the |
Wildcat spirit each season is once |
more getting ready for action un-|
der the capable guidance of veteran |
coach “Pete” Whittle. With most
of last year’s main-stays back, and |
with eleven freshmen at present |
trying out for the squad, prospects |
are bright for the six scheduled |

| contests.

Pete Ashcraft, Henry Brown, and |
Al Elder, top three from the 1955 |
team, are all looking good after
the first week of practice, accord-
ing to Coach Whittle, who has

especially strong confidence in|
Elder, a sophomore from Rich- |
mond, Va.

Other men from the suc-
cessful 1955 squad are John
Patterson, Steve Huntley,
Henry Griffin, and Ray Ant-
ley. Only one man was lost
by graduation, while three
other lettermen “retired” for
various other reasons. Miler
Angus McBride is out for his
first cross-country season.

In spite of the loss of four letter-
men, says Whittle, this year’s team
should be as good or better than
the '55 version. Among the fresh-
men who are working out, Char-
lotte’s Jim Alexander has unusual
potentialities. He proved himself
in the cake-race last week. An-
other frosh who will be right up
there is Graham George, whose
first contact with the sport was in
the same cake-battle.

The schedule is clear, and the
team will have only one home |
meet, against Richmond. There
are two triangular meets, and
towards the end of the season the
traditional State meet and the)

Southern Championship.

COACH BILL DOLE and his co-captains,
McRee look confident as they go Indian-fighting tonight. Belton and

McRee are the Cats’ big offensive

standing passer Dick Belton at
Quarterback, will give David-
son a two-pronged passing at-
tack. The Wildcats will be ex-
pected to do plenty of passing
tonight. Although Davidson
has a small squad (41 men),
Catawba is weaker in reserve,
with only 35 men.

The Cats are in pretty good phy
sical eondition. George Hart, out
standing Harding high athlete, has
an. infected hand. Tom. Cutting,
third string quarterback, and Ken

Conger have bruised muscles
The coaches indicate that team
spirit is good.

ONE CAKE RACER took a tumble and was almost trampled by
the thundering herd, as 230 freshmen took off on the annual cross-
country jaunt. Charlotte's Jim Alexander breezed to an easy win
and a homemade layer cake.

Ratterree,

Thompson

The Wildcat grid scene boasts two new faces on the coach-

the duties of line coach.

Coach Thompson is replacing
Chuck Clements who resigned to
undertake duties outside the coach-
ing. field.

PRO EXPERIENCE

Ratterree, former Wake Forest
guard who played on the power-
ful Deacon teams of ‘44 and ‘45

and with the 1946 Chicago Cardi-
nals, has a rich background of ex-|

perience both as player and coach.
The 33 year-old native of
Kings Mountain, in his eight-
year tenure in the coaching
profession, has served as line
coach at Lenior-Rhyne and
Wake Forest in addition to a
year as head coach at Staunton
Military Academy.
DOLE IMPRESSED
Head Coach Bill Dole feels the
addition of Ratterree will help
some of the forward wall

Wildcat Ath. | Ing staff with the addition of George Thompson, Davidson's
| new backfield coach, and Pride Ratterree, who will assume

problems. “Back in. the North
State Conference when we were
;on opposite sides of the field,

Coach Ratterree’s lines impressed
me. Now that we are on the same
team I am _ looking for that
| ruggedness up front that he de-
veloped at Lenior-Rhyne and
Wake Forest,” Dole said.

Coach George Thompson, a
35-year-old native of Raleigh,
joined Dole’s masterminding
forces in August.

Coach Dole is high in praise of
his new aide: “Ihave observed
Coach Thompson's work for the
past eight years. He is a real stu
dent of the game and. has com-
piled a fine record. I have looked

|forward for the past five years
to eventually having him on my
staff and feel extremely fortunate
jin obtaining his services.”

GEORGE THOMPSON and Pride Ratterree, recent additions to
the coaching staff, map pigskin strategy with Boss Dole. Thompson
is coaching the backfield, while Ratterree handles the forward Wall.
