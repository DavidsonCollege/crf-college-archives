YOUTH WANTS FREEDOM

True and False Freedom Con-
trasted By Minister

“There two. kinds
dom: true and false; false free-
dom, when wt are free to do as
we like, and true freedom, when
we are free to do as we ~ought.”
Thus did Dro W. TT.) Thompson
conclude and summarize his
mon last Sunday evening at Ves-
pers,

Taking “If the Sen therefore shalt
make you free, ye shall be free in-
deed.” John 8:36, as his text, Dr.
Thompson preached a very practi-
cal sermon on the subject of per-
sonal freedom. .

He said, “We are all thrown .to-
getner in ‘one crucible, life touching
life’ in’ order to emphasize the
second point that he made. That
point was there is no such thing as
absolute personal independence,
bit that we all exert some influ-
ence somewhere.

Beginning with an incident that
had occurred to him in connection
with another youth whose cry. “l
want to be free” echoed the cry
of many modern youths. he then
proceded to prove that just as we
are governed in our physical ac-

are of free-

sere

tions by the laws of science and na-

ture, so are we governed in our
mental and moral actions by laws.
There are many laws such as those
giyen us by nature, those made for
us by legislative bodies, and those
discovered by us, that
break without being punished for
it. However he stated that we are
punished by our sins and not for
them. . Such punishment. js ines-
capable,

Following several very apt illus-
trations which carried his point
directly to eke center of tke prob-

gem, Dr. Thompson brought his dis-

cussion of dhe relation of laws to
freedom by stating: “To be freewe
must be obedient to all laws.”

Dr. Thoinpson pursued the topic
of our influence, consciously or un-
conscionsiy exerted, on the lives
of. those close to of distant from
us, with more striking examples
from his own and other's’ exper-
ience. Cautioning us to always ren
member that somebody has taken us
for his ideal in life and that we
can never bury the influence for a
single moment, he told of a_letier
he had received ifom a man in the
Philippines who had taken him,
Dr. Thompson, as his ideal,.and how
‘he had been helped.

lu sharp contrast the story of
the down-trodden man pointing to
the picture of his cotlege chums on
the wall and saying, “That was the
man who taught me to drink! had
avery powerfut effect. Just so
there is influence for bad as there
is for good:

The story of the prodigal son was
retold very poignantly to illustrate
the effect of our apparently self-
related actions on “those to whom
we are dear. Disclased was the
truth that when every one else_was
gone there was still God the Father
to whom we are responsible for our
deeds,

The story of the American, at the
North Pole, who walked out into
the snow to save. his own life at
the sacrifice of his comrade's, as
contrasted with the story’ of the
Britisher, at che South Pole. who
walked out into the snow to save
the lives of his comrades at the
sacrifice of his own was used dra-
matically to drive home the con-

“ception of freedom with Félation to

a man’s desires. He left it to
tus to judge whether the man under
the command of his lower desires

or the man under the command of J.

his higher desires is the freer man.
Dr. Thompson. closed his sermon

“with this interpretation of the text:

“Tf man takes Christ as his ideal
then-he-shal-be-free indeed.”

fessor of religious education at the

Educators Request
Olympians Recalled

(BY rtstciated Caltegiate Press)

Newark, No. (ACP)—Forty
American educk&urs, presidents of
colleges in 27 states, have joined
in a request to the Amateur Ath-
letic Union of the United States
and the American Olympic com-
mittee for withdrawal of American
participation in the 1936 Olympic
games in Berlin.

Announcement of the educators’
stand was made by Frank King-
don—president of Dana College,
Newark. It was accompanied by a
statement setting forth reasons tor
reqdesting American  withdraweab
and signed by the forty. college
presidents.

“It is our considered judgment,”
the statement says, “based upon the
record of events tha: have trans-
pired in Germany for the past two
and a half years, that the inequal-
ities and discrimination practiced
against Jews, Catholics, Protestants,
labor, Masons and all independents
are perpetuated in the held of sports
and in the Olympic games.

“We believe further that these
games are being used by Nazi Ger-
many as an instrument for the
propagation of her ideals, which
represent the destruction of demo-
cratic and progressive society...

“We believe that the Ameficans
should refuse.to take part in the
games.” t
