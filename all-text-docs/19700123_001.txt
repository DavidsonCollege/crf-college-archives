In order to plan more ef-
fectively the future of the
Davidson community, a group
of men from, the town and
College have formed a Com-
mittee to study.the effects of
the growing Charlotte region.

In the summer of 1968,
some interested citizens start-
ed holding discussions about
the future -of Davidson.

They saw that ‘‘due to its
location within the greater
Charlotte area, the Town of
Davidson will become pro-
gressively more subject to ur-
ban influences. It is the con-
sensus of this group that
these influences will inevi-
tably lead to changes, many
of which might not be desire-
able.”

Board Receives

AED Proposals

The report of the Academy
for Educational Development
will provide the primary
stimulus for consideration of
changes‘at Davidson when the
Board of Trusteés meets Feb
3-4, according to~ President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

Rexford Moon, director of
the study and Vice-President
of AED, will present the. re-
port-at-a-— plenary session of
the Trustees at 10 a.m. Feb.
3. Dr. Chester Alter, chan-
cellor emeritus of the Univer-
sity of Denver anda member
of the AED panel will assist
in the presentation.

The afternoon session will
begin with the section of the
report concerned with cam
pus development, including
plans for the library and
other future construction.

Future development of the
campus will take place on
the North side, Spencer said,

The AED recommends that
the library be situated be-
tween the existing campus
and the area to be developed.

Displays of the recom-
mended construction _ sites

will be placed.on the grounds
after the meeting, he said.

Spencer stressed that the
AED report, like the Com-
mission reports, is not a man-
datory: blueprint, but an ad-
visory report to be used at
the discretion of the Trus-
tees

“It is a confidential re
port. to the trustees. They
will have to decide what
parts to release for pubii-
cation,” he said.

Before the trustees split
into their various standing
committees for consideration
of proposals within their area
of jurisdiction, Spencer will
summarize his position on
reforms. .

comment on the
questions that are in-
in both the Commis-
sion and AED reports,’ he
Said. “T intend to outline al
ternatives to the Board
include recommenda
judgments on
those matters.”

The Board will meet again
in plenary session on, Feb. 4
at 10:30 a.m; to consider the
recommendations of the
committees,

“Because of the complex-
ity and far reaching nature
of most of the questions in-
volved, there could hardly be

neat and final decisions on
all of these matters,’ Spen-
cer said.

“What they are more like-
ly to do at this meeting is
approve some things in. prin-
ciple. so that the
can be brought back and
worked over later,’’ he said.

Spencer said that the delay

in the submission of the
AED report occurred be-
cause the panel had_ not
completed the section on

campus development at the
time of the autumn deadline.

The first draft of the re-
port was submitted shortly
before Christmas for a rou-
tine check to see if all the
areas to be studied had been
treated, he said. 5:

Spencer indicated that
recommendations for admin-
istrative reorganization will
be included in the report, but
said that matters dealing
with personnel would not be
made public.

The Trustees dine with
members of the faculty Feb.
3 and attend a student recen;
tion at 10 p.m: in the

ketball game.

“It was Mr. Tate's . belief,
shared by the committee, that
rather than be subject to the
forces of urban sprawl, we
should attempt to plan the
growth of the community in
constructive ways, and there-
by make it an even more de-
sireable community in which
to live,"’ Spencer stated.

The original organizing
letter listed the basic pur-
poses of the committee as to
determine the ‘type of com-
munity best suited to serve
the residents of the Town of
Davidson and Davidson Col-
lege, and a practical and
orderly way to effect and con-
trol the development towards
an agreed Community. ob-

Some of the factors listed

to. be considered were the
Economic situation, such as
jobs and retail sales; the

population-growth rate and
makeup by age and econom
ic groups; the Character of
the Community its physical
appearance and atmosphere,
Facilities. along the residen

of the Committee is not the

body presidents has alienat-
ed many of the people.”

Projecting into the future,
Coble stated that his main
goal will be to encourage
interest in the SGA. “If
enough people are interested,
we will. get results," he said.
One of these may be that of
self-scheduled exams which
he ‘affirmed would be the first
order of business in his ad
ministration,

opposed for the  vice-presi-
dential office, voiced the
goals for which he will strive

Burney is also considering

e videa of painting the
rooms.in the residence halls
different colors as well as
improving the lighting.
“These rooms are terribly
drab," he said. ‘‘They must
be improved.”

The ‘sophomore slump”
is another question — with
which he is concerned. ‘This
condition may be avoided by
not breaking up the fresh-
men -haHs after the. first
year," he reasoned, “I be-
lieve the unity of the fresh-
men halls hould be main-
tained until the students are
fully adjusted to the school.

“Another solution may be
to place all the freshmen in
Belk Dormitory, thus achie-
ving class cohesiveness rather

e

than fostering the disjoint sys-
tem of spreading. the class
over three buildings.”

In addition to student gov-
ernment elections, YMCA of
ficers were elected — also.
