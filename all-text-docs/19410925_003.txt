Question of |
The Week

Since the new library has been
under construction much question |
has been raised as to what will be
done with the old library building. |
Now that the new building is nearly ,
ready for occupancy this question}
becomes particularly timely. So the |
rambling reporter for the Question
of the Week asked representative
members of the student body the
following question:

What do you think should be
done with the old library building?

Below are their answers.

Myron Sandifer, Junior:

The Y. M..C. A. has hopes of
an energetic expansion into new
fields this year. I believe that it
could profitably use the extra space
provided by a move into the old
library.

Julien McCall, Senior:

I think that the old library build-
ing should be used as a combina-
tion “Y” game and recreation room,
and a social center—mainly for the
use of non-fraternity men on dance
week-ends—and on other occasions.
The non-fraternity men have been
at a great disadvantage as far as
social life has been concerned, and
I hope that the old library can be}
used to their best advantage. |

Ren Junior:

It seems to me'the only thing to
do with the old library is to
it over*to'the Y. M. C. A. If they)
do this I hope they do a little plan-|

Jim Chapman, Junior:

Since the school does not have!
adequate space for its present en-|
rollment, why not convert the old |
ld@erary into a dormitory? This,
would enable Mrs. Smith to bring |
the boys in from town:

Bill Harrill, Sophomore:

As everyone has probably noticed,
present Y. M. C. A. building
is uot large enough to accommodate
the needs of our student body. I
think it would be a splendid idea
to make the “old” library the “new”

Dick Port, Sophomore:

Probably the school’s most glar-
ing present need (aside from a gym)
is increased Y. M. C. A. facilities.
With larger and more complete ac-
cemmodation would come a sub-
sequent rise in interest in the pro-
gram being carried by the “Y.” The
added space would permit more rec-
reational equipment, thus bringing
a larger number of boys in actual)
comtact with the work of the ey." |
This would tend_to develop an ac-|
tive rather than a passive. interest |

en the part of many who perhaps/ <ignally when she finishes her mu-|

Dan Hodges, Senior:

large and attractive social center.)
Davidsen needs a_ recreation hall
where students can entertain guests, |
and where they have ample facili-
ties for indoor recreation. Some of |
the upstairs rooms might be con-|
verted into offices for the Davidson-
ian, Scripts and Pranks, and Quips
and Cranks. These publications
are in dire need of adequate edi- |
staff facili-|
ties. |
Joe Sevier Eve, Junior: |
In my mind the best thing that |
could be done to the present library |
is to have it razed completely. The!
Davidson campus has too many old |
buildings of an umattractive archi- |
tecture already. This architecture |
is Vietorian and grotesque, and can}
mever attain a permanent beauty.|
Chambers will always be beautiful
because of the eternity of. its style’
of architecture. |
Deane Watson, Sophomore:
~f believe that the old
would make an excellent place in}
which to study. Its rooms could be}
converted to large-and small study |
rooms and one could be assured of |
peace and quiet there at all times.|
This is a vital need to Davidson |
College students. One would have |
none of the ordinary: disturbances |
such as water fights, yelling be-|
buildings, loud radios, bull |
etc.

Four Comely
Co-eds Grace
Local Campus

Misses Linker, Lassiter, Kerr,
Morrison Give Interview
To Reporter
By JOHN FAIRLEY

If you should meet a girl walk-
ing across the Davidson campus,
don't silently pass her, wondering
who she is and what in the world
she is doing on a man's grounds;
for it is one of Davidson's four
co-eds, and that’s exactly what they
don't want you to do. As one of
the girls put it, “The Davidson cus-
tom is to speak to everyone you
pass on the campus, but a lot of
boys walk by us without even nod-
ding.” Unbelievable, but true.

Who are these coeds? Upper
classmen recognize Isabel Linker,
Carolyn Lassiter, and Betty Kerr
gracing the walks and classrooms
again, while Lucy Morrison is an
important part of the class of ‘45.

Masculine Preferences

What do they think about the
Davidson boys? Their smiles and
glances at each other indicated
that this was a question at which
they would_like_to keep the lads
guessing. While neatly dodging

the issue with “The campus-is real-
}ly beautiful,” they seemed anxious

to get across the idea that they all
thought ~‘“different

finally admitted that the town was

Blondes and brunettes find equal}

favor in the eyes of Davidson's fair-

fer 1-170th, but the man who has
curly hair and dark eyes seems to
get the nod. They all prefer. a
tall man, at least six feet, with

broad shoulders which taper down,
while “ears that poke out” seem

to be a definite handicap. Anyone

|}who wants to impress two of the
fcoeds Should rush dowWn to the

“Stud” (free plug) and buy a pipe,
but another stated a preference to
the cigarette scuttlers.

Glenn Miller is “tops” with two
of the’ girls, but the usual dissent-
ing voice expressed a
Charlie Spivak. Although they like

football, the coeds’ claimed they
had no special admiration for the
gridiron warriors

Many grumblers who object to
having to study or sleep through
chapel every day might take note
of the fact that the coeds “usually”
go to chapel, ever though they are
not required to—just because they

like it.
