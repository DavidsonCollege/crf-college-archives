Baschall 3-3in conference after Furman series

By BOYD COGGINS

The Wildcats’ baseball team
completed a successful week of
play by winning two of three
games over Furman last weekend.
They upped their conference re-
cord to 3-3 and their overall record
to 9-4-1. For the week the Cats
were 4-3 as they won other games
over The Citadel and Husson Col-
lege.

The Cats got off to a shaky
start in their first three conference
games against The Citadel at
Charleston, S.C. They won the
first game of a doubleheader on
March 1Sth 11-3 as they pounded
out || hits, four of which were
home runs. However, the Cats
dropped a heart breaker in the sec-
ond game when they lost by the
score of 1-0. The next day, David-
son lost in a slugfest, 15- 8.

In the first game, sophomore
Alan Lewis was the hero as he
knocked in five runs with a three-
run home run and two run double.
His five RBIs came in his first two
at-bats as the Cats scored seven
runs in the first two innings. In the
first inning Davidson jumped to a
3-0 lead when Lewis hit his home
run after sophomore Bill Masse
and senior Keith Helfant had
walked. In the second inning
senior Tim Waters hit a solo home
run with one man out. Junior
David Depaul and Masse _fol-
lowed with walks. Depaul scored
when Helfant singled. Lewis then
brought home Masse and Helfant
with his two run double.

In the fifth inning the Cats
scored three more runs on a solo
home run by junior David Tur-
geon to lead off the inning and a
two run shot by Waters, his sec-
ond of the game, which brought in
sophomore Rob Zimmerman,
who had reached base on a single.
At this point Davidson had a com-
manding 10-3 lead. Turgeon
scored the Cats last run in the sixth
on an RBI double by Zimmerman.

In the second game of the
doubleheader the Cats could man-
age only five hits off pitcher Bill
Montei. Junior Billy Waitsman
pitched a superb game as he gave
up only one run on four hits.
Citadel's winning run came across

the plate in the fifth inning. The
Bulldogs’ Kevin Vickery, who
had walked after one out, was sac-
rificed to second by the next batter
and scored when Ken Vickery rip-
ped a solid hit to the outfield.

On the next day, The Citadel
took advantage of seven Wildcat
errors to defeat the Cats. The
Bulldogs pounded out 10 runs in
the seventh and eighth innings to
overcome a 6-5 Davidson lead to
win 15-8. Lewis and senior Scott
Weaver were the leading hitters
for the Cats. Lewis had three hits
including a double and two RBIs
and Weaver hit a two run home
run in the first inning.

The Cats redeemed them-
selves in their next game against
Husson College as they won 18-2.
The Cats pounded out 20 hits for
sophomore Dave Fitzgerald, who
pitched six strong innings in his
first appearance since joining the
team after basketball season. He
struck out 13 batters and allowed
only two hits as he pitched shutout
ball to record his first victory of
the season. Freshman Jeff Loser
completed the last three innings
by allowing only two runs on two
hits. The Cats leading hitter was
Depaul, who went four for five
with two doubles and two RBIs.
Davidson also got a three run
home run by Weaver in the first
inning.

Last Saturday, the Cats con-
tinued conference play at home as
they whipped Furman 15-0 in the
first game of a double-header.
Junior pitcher Steve Condon
raised his record to 5-0 by pitching
a no-hitter. The only Paladin to
reach base was the first batter of
the game, Jim Holloman, who
reached on an error. Condon then
retired 21 straight batters as he
struck out 10 and walked no one
while lowering his ERA to 1.51.

The Cats scored seven runs in
the first inning as they dominated
Furman early. Masse scored the
first run when Lewis hit into a fiel-
der’s choice. With two men out
Turgeon single and scored when
Weaver double to deep rightfield.
Weaver brought across the third
run when the Furman shortstop
booted a ball hit by junior catcher
Dan Simonds. The Cats continued
their two out rally when a double

by Zimmerman plated both
Simonds and sophomore Roy Vil-
ardi, who reached base on a walk.
Depaul capped the seven run out-
burst with a two-run home run.
The Cats scored three more runs in
the fourth inning and four in the
fifth inning to win going away.

In the second game David-
son’s bats went silent as they lost
3-0. The Cats could manage only
six hits with Simonds collecting
half of them on a double and two
singles. Fitzgerald was the hard
luck loser. He pitched seven in-
nings as he struck out five batters
and allowed only three runs, none
of which were earned. He has a re-
cord for the season of 1-1 witha
0.00 ERA in thirteen innings

pitched.

In Sunday’s final game of the
three game series the Cats mauled
the Paladins 13-6. Waitsman
raised his record to 2-1 on the year
as he pitched a complete game for
the Cats. He struck out four bat-
ters and lowered his ERA to 2.53.
At the plate the Cats were lead by
Masse and Turgeon who had three
hits apiece. Lewis, the team’s
leading hitter at .458, contributed
his third home run of the year to
the winning cause. The Cats broke
the game open in the fourth inning
when they scored nine runs on six
hits. Simonds, who walked twice
in the inning, scored both times he
reached base.

The bad the

news” from

1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

weekend series with Furman is
that Helfant, the Cats starting sec-
ond baseman, suffered a broken
cheekbone when he was hit by a
line drive during pre-game work-
outs. He is expected to be out of
action indefinitely. The Cats will
sorely miss both his offense and
defense until he returns to the
lineup.

This Easter weekend, the Cats
host a crucial three game series
with defending Southern Confer-
ence champion Western Carolina.
The Catamounts will bring good
starting pitching and solid hitting.
The Cats need to win this weekend
in order to be in first place at the
midway point of the conference
season.

‘Track teams strive to overcome small numbers

By MIKE ADAMS

The Davidson men’s and
women’s track teams are fighting
to build competitive programs.
They are hampered by inexperi-
ence, injuries, and a lack of per-
sonnel, but first-year coach Gary
Andrew says they have improved
through the indoor season and will
continue to do so during the out-
door season.

The women's track team is in-
hibited by a lack of performers.
There are only 14 people on the
team, and they are unable to field
participants in several events. In

the season's first outdoor meet,
the Lady Cats had no one in the
100 meters, the four by 110-yard
relay, the 5000 meters, the triple
jump, the long jump or the high
jump. Despite the holes in their
line-up, the women managed a
second place finish out of four
teams in their first outdoor meet.
Key performers for the Lady
Cats are senior Caroline Kelly in
the 800 and 1500 meters and
freshman Maureen Harris in the
discus.
Andrew says the women’s
team does not have a lot of experi-

ence, but he sees a lot of improve-
ment in store as the season prog-
resses,

The men’s track team is also
very small, with only 20 mem-
bers. They were unable to field
performers in the hammer and the
steeplechase in their first meet.
They came in last out of the four
teams entered in that meet.

The men_ are _ probably
strongest in the field events. The
Cats have strongman Lou Krem-
pel, a senior, putting the shot and

throwing the discus. Senior
Robert McLain and exchange stu-
dent Thomas Gebauer are also
solid performers in the discus
event. Senior Jay Braun, David-
son's jack-of-all-trades, anchors
the long jump and the pole vault.
He has also participated in two of
the relay teams and the 200 met-
ers.

Key performers in the track
events are Braun, sophomore
Robert Sickles in the 110 yard
dash and junior Emil Cekada in

the 800 meters and the four by
440-yard relay. Andrew sees a lot
of potential in an inexperienced
distance crew and expects them to
be strong by the end of the season.

Only the men will compete in
the Southern Conference outdoor
meet. They scored only one point
in the indoor meet, but Andrew
expects a much better perfor-
mance in the outdoor meet.

The teams have two remaining
home meets. They will be hosting
a meet on Mar. 29 and the David-

son Relays the following Satur-
day.
