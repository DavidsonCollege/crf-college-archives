A SOBERING EXPERIENCE

While waiting for homecoming weekend to get
started last Friday afternoon, 1 wandered over to the
soccer field which is beyond the gym. There I found
a sizable crowd watching or doing various other things
while the Wildcat soccer team (we do have one)
trampled that perennial kick-team powerhouse, North
Carolina Wesleyan, 6-1. No one seemed to know where
Wesleyan was located but they assured me it was

somewhere in the state.

Friday the crowd was unusually large. There were
probably 100 people sitting on the grassy bank over-
jooking the field. Most of the spectators had their
homecoming dates sitting on blankets next to them,
probably trying to get them warmed up for that night.

Still, there was a sizable group of onlookers who
seemed to know what was going on. In previous games
with Methodist and Pembroke College, our team tied
0-0 and lost 5-3, both real thrillers. So, Friday the fans
were going wild while our “scoreless wonders” un-
leashed their feet and kicked six shots into the netting.

For a person who knows little or nothing about the
sport, it can be very confusing. I heard one girl ask her
date why the fullback kicked the ball out-of-bounds
and over the bank everytime Wesleyan came down on
the offensive. It was a good question because it seemed
that when the ball came anywhere near either of the
two Davidson fullbacks, Rich Cowart and Joe Norton,
they proceeded to boot the ball out of reach of every-
one including the ball boy. I don’t know but it may be

one of the secret Davidson s

style of play.

It was unusual this year to not see any foreign

students playing in the game. There

years in the past when the best players on the team
were Richardson Scholars. This year it seems that two

foreigners came out for the sport but didn’t like prac- .

Fogleman says the record
thus far is actually ‘“‘deceiv-
ing.” Tuesday's match with
St. Andrew's was played in
the rain, with Davidson los-
ing 3-1, and the game with
Pembroke was played on a
cinder-and-sand field. Fogle-
man said the adverse play-
ing conditions hampered the
team's attack.

Fogleman blamed the
scoreless tie with Methodist
College on lack of condition-
ing time: “We just ran out
of gas.’’ he said. ‘We only
had eight days to get in
shape before the game.”

The greatest strength of the
Wildcat team is depth. The
team in past years has us-
ually numbered about 18, but
this year Fogleman has 28

on his roster.

“We have two units,”
Fogleman explained, ‘‘and
I can start either one. They
are all excellent soccer play-
ers.”

Although Fogleman is look-
ing forward to the confer-
ence matches, he is concern.
ed about some of the smaller
schools the team faces.

“A lot of these schools

don't have football teams, so
soccer is their major sport."
he said. ‘‘We will play’ in
several homecoming matches
this year."

The ‘Cats will look for a re-
peat of last Friday's 6-1 win
over Wesleyan in tomorrow's
game, and will rely on lead-
ing scorer Bill Horton and
an improving offense to top-
ple the Pirates.

Phi Delts Dominate IMAC

By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sporfs Editor
Freshman intramural flick.
erball began this week as the
Phi Delts continue to roll in
the fraternity competition.

The Delts have compiled
a perfect 7-0 record and
seem to be a sure bet to
eapture the flickerball tro-
phy, one of the few IMAC
championships that has elud-
ed them in recent years.

According to Delt coach
Dave Fernbach, the defen.
sive una@has been the major
reason for the undefeated
record. ‘‘The defensive unit
won the close games, the
ones with the Sigma Nus,
Kappa Sigs, and Sigma
Chis,"" Fernbach said.

The defense seems to be
growing even stronger, as
the victories over the last
two opponents, the KA’s and
SAE’s, were shutouts.

SC Sportswrifers
Pick Slade Again

The Southern Conference
press corps once again
signalled out Wildcat quarter-
back Gordon Slade this week,
picking him as the confer-
ence’s offensive player of the
week.

It was the second straight
week Slade has been honor-
ed by the award.

The 6-1, 190 pound junior
completed a record-tying 30
of 37 passes in the ‘Cats 30-
18 homecoming win over
Connecticut. The comple-
tions moved Slade to second
in the nation in passing, and
ninth in total offense.

Slade.threw to Mike Kelly
for seven completions in the
game, moving Kelly to fifth
in the nation in pass receiv-
ing, with 28 receptions.

Slade has 82 completions
in 138 tosses, for 912 yards
via the airways. He has 867
yards total offense.

The key to the defensive
unit has been the line, led
by rusher Bill Traxler and
sophomore ends Harlan Day
and John McCammon. They
have done a fine job of con-
tainment. Others perform.
ing well on defense have
been Frank Murphy and Cart
Salter at defensive halfback.

The offensive unit of the
Delts has not been impotent,
however. The offense has
been responsible for the
major portion of the 23 points
per game scoring average.

‘Sophomore tailback Jack
Caldwell is the main offen-
sive threat. “We seem to
move when he’s in there,”
says Fernbach of Caldwell.
George House is Caldwell's
main receiver and leads the
team in touchdowns.

gan this week with four
games on Tuesday.

Team 1 (East!), defeated
Team 5 (Cannan 2 and 4) 6-0
on the $5-yard return of an

interception by Trip Adams.
Team 1 selected Adams as
its offensive player of the
week for his performance.

Their defensive player of
the week is Sam ‘Robinson,

Improving Wildkittens Meet
Baby Spiders Here Today

The improving Wildcat
freshmen gridders, fresh
from a victory over Carolina
Military last week, meet the
Baby Spiders from the Uni-
versity of Richmond this af-
ternoon at 2 p.m. on Rich-
ardson Field.

The game is expected to
reveal the improved passing
attack of Ricky Kimmerlin,
who hit 11 of 18 passes
against the Cadets last week-
end.

Weakened Whittlemen
Face Rough Schedule

By STEVE WILLIAMS
Sports Writer

With the improving stren-
gth of other colleges and the
loss of Davidson's two top
cross country runners, it
looks like Coach Heath Whit-
tle’s 1968 harriers are in for
a rough time. The team has
not seen victory in three out-
ings this season.

The team’s top two runn-
ers from Jast year, Jim Mc-
Laughlin and John Puckett,
have left a serious gap to be
filled this fall. McLaughlin
has departed via graduation.
and Puckett is spending his
junior year abroad.

Whittle added that this sea-
son ‘will be rougher than
ever." This is particularly
true because many Wildcat
opponents are receiving sub-
sidation in this department.
Davidson doesn't.

The teams main hopes
center around their captain,
Randy Phillips, one of the
only two seniors on the
squad. Phillips, is listed as

one of the top six runners
and it is up to him, Whittle
said, to unify the team and
give it the needed leader-
ship.

James Puckett, a junior
with two years experience,
is probably the man with the
greatest potential of being
Davidson's top runner.

Whittle is also depending on
Stagg Newman, anot her
junior and a letterman, who
is considered by assistant
coach Sterling Martin to be
the team’s hardest worker.

letterman’ who missed part
of last season due to injury,
and Reaves Louthan are list-
ed as having good chances
of becoming a top runner.

As the list grows the squad
appears younger and young.
er and Coach Whittle points
out that there are many
promising freshmen partici-
pating this year.

Even with the tough sched-
ule ahead, Whittle and Mar-
tin expect a mych better
season this year. simply be-
cause of the team's better
balance and desire to win.

Also singled out was Har-

Both Slade and Morrow
heaped praise on fellow Wild-

ahother school mark by find-
ing the range on field goals
from 35, 24, and 31 yards

With the oncoming of this
