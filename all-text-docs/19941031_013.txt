Football suffers another tough loss on the road, 12-7

By Matt Pitzer

The road proved a rough path
to tread once again for the football
team Saturday.

Coming off a tough ion t the
week before at Methodist, the Wild-
cats hoped to rebound against
Hampden-Sydney. But the theme
of the game was missed opportuni-
ties, as Davidson fell 12-7.

Davidson (1-6) failed to con-
vert two fourth-down chances deep
in Tigers’ territory, including one
chance at the 10 with less than
three minutes to play.

The defense hung tough one
more time, holding Hampden-
Sydney to just over 200 total yards
and two touchdowns. It also set up
the Wildcats’ only touchdown on
Will Robinson’s third-quarter in-

terception.

Davidson’s offense put up
some impressive numbers, espe-
cially in the air, but they could not
get the ball intothe end zone. Kevin
Holzworth bounced back from a
couple rough games to complete
21 of 38 attempts for 226 yards.

Kirk Roberts was the leading

" receiver, hauling in ten passes for

109 yards. The running game was
led by converted linebacker Chris

*Leak, who churned out 66 yards on

24 carries.

Coach Tim Landis hoped that
the Wildcats could get its offense
going early and play well in the
first quarter. But it was the Tigers
(3-5) that got the early score on a
12-yard pass completion.

In the second quarter,

Men’s soccer finishes as
co-champions of So. Con.

By Will Cobb

With the regular season com-
pleted after yesterday’s game
against Vanderbilt, the men’s soc-
cer team now looks to postseason
competition beginning with this
weekend’s Southern Conference
Tournament in Greensboro. Any
hopes for the Wildcats to compete
in this year’s NCAA tournament
will begin on Friday atnoonagainst
the 7th seed.

Though the Wildcats finished
the season as co-champions of the
Southern Conference, Davidson
will enter the tournament as the

2nd seed, Furman shares the regu-
lar season title with Davidson with
amatching 5-1 record, but the Pala-
dins won the head-to-head match
earlier in the season, so they will
be the top seed.

The Wildcats will be led by
scoring leader sophomore Robert
Clarke, who has 11 goals on the
season.

The semifinals will be played
on Saturday with the champion-
ship game on Sunday afternoon.
The soccer team would like to see
as many fans as possible to make
the trip this weekend.

The field hockey team defeated Virginia Tech 4-0 Saturday.

Davidson marched from deep in

. its own territory down to the Ti-

gers’ 29, But on fourth down, they
couldn’t gain the one yard they
needed for the first down and turned
the ball over.

The Wildcats held defensively
until the third quarter when the

offense had a chance to respond.
They drove 43 yards on just three
plays, and Holzworth capped the
drive with a 6-yard toss to Ty
Crovetti on Davidson’s first sus-
tained third-quarter drive of the
season,

Field hockey rumbles
past VaTech, drives for
Deep South Tourney

By Dave Dwyer

The Virginia Tech women’s
field hockey team wandered into
Davidson on Saturday looking to
steal a win and spoil the final home
appearance of five Davidson se-
niors.

What they got, in fact, was a
shellacking by a fired-up Davidson
group that kept play in Va. Tech’s
half of the field all afternoon and
started the ignition for a run at the
Deep South tournament champi-
onship.

Before the match started
started, the five Davidson seniors—
Andrea Short, co-captain Robin
Pepper, co-captain Nancy Hilles,
Megan Snyder, and Mary
Ferguson—were honored for their
contributions to Davidson field
hockey over the past four years.
Junior midfielder Nicole Ficeto
opened the scoring, and the offen-

sive continued until halftime,

which found Davidson up 4-0. That

would be the final score, giving the
Wildcats a rebound victory from

‘last weekend’s 2-1 loss in sudden

death overtime to Virginia Com-
monwealth and double-overtime
tie with the Richmond Spiders. The

win raised the team’s record to 10- -

5-1 on the season.

Davidson travelled to Radford
Sunday for their final regular sea-
son match of the 1994 campaign.
A win against the Friars would
give Davidson two straight wins
heading into the Deep South Tour-
nament, which begins next Friday
and continues throughout the week-
end. The unselfishness and skill
level that Davidson’s field hockey
team possesses should provide
them with an opportunity to add
another championship to Davidson
athletics.

Volleyball continues to gain strength over season

By Traci Cliett
Although. the-overall_record
stands at 8-19 on the season, the
Davidson volleyball team is still
putting up tough fights in close
matches. Davidson fell to a strong
UNC-Greensboro last Thursday in

Baker. The loss was a result of
extremely .close..games...UNC-

Greensboro swept the Wildcats in

three straight games, but the scores
were 15-13, 15-13, 15-11.

This past weekend, Davidson
traveled to Tennessee to face the

Moccasins of UT-Chattanooga.
The. Wildcats. secured-a_long-
awaited conference victory over
Chattanooga in impressive fash-
ion. Davidson swept their oppo-
nent, needing only three games to
finish off their opponent (15-9,15-

10, 15-4).

The Wildcats will face the
Georgia Southern Eagles this Fri-
day in Belk Arena at 7:00 p.m.
followed by another home game
on Sunday against the Furman Pala-
dins at 2:00 p.m.

marched back with a 59-yard drive,
topped. by running back Robert
Thompson’ s 2-yard dive late in the
quarter.

The Wildcats were still resil-
ient, however, fighting back one
more time in an attempt to win.
Starting at their own 9-yard line,
Davidson zipped right down the
field to the Hampden-Sydney 10
on 15 plays. The Tigers’ defense
held tough again, and the Wildcats
turned the ball over.

The Wildcats come home this
week for their final home game of
the year against Centre at 1:30
p.m. After a game the following
week at Bridgewater, the Wildcats
make their long-awaited trip to
Bermuda to play the University of
the South:

Women's i
cross country
exceeds

expectations
in Southern

Conference
meet

By Erin Roach

When the cross country teams
arrived at Chattanooga, Tennessee
Friday night, the Davidson harri-
ers discovered they could not have
asked for a finer location for the
Southern Conference Champion-
ships. The course was a runner’s
dream come true.

The women were on a mis-
sion, having been picked in the
preseason coaches’ poll to finish
seventh out of the eight teams.

They were hoping to prove
themselves better than that predic-
tion; and they did so as nearly
everybody ran their best race of the
year.

The women eventually fin-
ished in fifth place out of eight
teams, and the men’s squad placed
ninth.

After a sloppy start, the Wild-
cats focused on the race and fought
through the middle part of the race,
which is traditionally the hardest
part of the run for them.

Senior co-captain Elizabeth
Bishop was in the spotlight this
weekend, finishing tenth overall to
become just the second runner ever
to make the all-conference team.
Her time of 18:41 was also the
second fastest in Davidson his-
tory.

Sallie Permar, Katie
McKelvie, Laura Jordan and Erin
Roach also each turned their best
performances of the season with
times of 21:22, 20:00, 19:46, and
19:07, respectively.

The women have one more
meet this year: the NCAA Region
II championships at Furman in
two weeks.
