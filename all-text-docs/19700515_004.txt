professor of English at Van-

Davidson opened the sym-
posium with an establish-
ment of the historical back-
ground of the aristocratic
South’s dedication to religion.
“The two facts which best
explain this dedication to
the Trinity in the South are
the inherent truth of Christ-
unflagging
among

professor of

ianity and. the
loyalty common
Southerners.” ‘
Next, Rhodes presented a
more detailed study of the re-
ligious history of the South.
While the North lived’ in
confidence the South: lived
a pride which was de-
discouraged,’ he

perienced the tragedy of de- .

feat, and the
ing humiliation.
The final address of the
evening was presented by
Sullivan and was _ entitled
“Death by Melancholy.”

accompany

The historical context of
Sullivan's © papers was the
period directly following

World War II in which the
Southern Renaissance of the
"30s ended rather abruptly.

His general thesis was,
“The artist reflects the so-
ciety in which he performs
his art.”

Sullivan’s approach is to
the new secularism follow-
ing World War I! and the
vacuum if left in the world
of letters.

He concluded that the
writer must now develop in
his own what
be inherent in

soul used to
society. He
must’ reclaim the religious
zeal. The divine
reality must be restored to
the artist for the art to
survive."

The two speakers for
Tuesday night were Lewis
Simpson, the editor of the
“Southern Review,” and
George Core,
vidson professor -and
director of the
of Georgia Press.

Thousands Gather
In Name Of Peace

A REACTION

By BILL POWELL
and SID MOODY

After some four days of
active protest at Davidson
against the expansion of
the Southeast Asian war and
the tragedy at Kent State,
several of us headed to-
ward the nation's capital to
participate in a massive
anti-war rally.

Full of possibly the most
radical spirit Davidson has
ever seen, five of us aimed
towards Washington in or-
der to express our feelings
about peace and Kent State.

However, our expectations

for the ‘protest rally “failed
to be realized.

We ‘were all. véterans of
the November Moratorium
and felt that the sincerity
of that rally seemed to be
lacking last

We were both impressed
by the large crowd estimat-

weekend.¢

world and the

movement.

ed at between 60,000.and
100,000 which assembled
on such short notice.

Yet, at the same time, the
frivolity of the crowd, as
evident by the “frolicking in
the reflection pool and by
the ‘‘grooving out’’ on the
rock bands, made us doubt
that everyone was there
solely for the peace protest.

Some, perhaps even a ma-
jority, were there just be-

cause it was the “in” thing
to” do.
And so they came with

their bells; the boys bare
chested, the liberated wo-
men braless (and some
times bare-chested). all in a
generally rebellious mood.
The speeches we heard
Friday night and Saturday
were repetitious and often
meaningless. Most of the
speakers emphasized revol-
ution more than peace.
We grew tired of a rhetor-
ic which was. dominated by
“right on,’ “power to the
people,”’ etc,

We do feel the
an ethical

need for
revolution in the

United States, but we be-
lieve that violent revolu
tion would only lead to an
archy.

Too many who chanted
for revolution’ had: not
thought thoroughly about
revolution and its conse-

quences, Fortunately, the
many threats of the revolu-
tionaries about violence did
not materalize.

We were favorably im-
pressed though by the man-
ner in which the D. C. po-

wesenirt . " wenen

lice conducted themselves.
With the aid of the New*
Mobe and its marshals the
police were able to avoid the
major confrontation with the
crowd.

The police brutality so
heralded in today’s head-
lines was not evident to

us last weekend.

We do not, however, deny
the existence of such bru-
tality in other cases. When
violence did come to the
surface, the New Mobe mar-
shals were there first to at-
tempt to head it off.

We returned to Davidson
last Sunday with our radical
spirit dampened. Current-
ly we are turned off (to
an expression) by
the hippie culture.

... Infirmary Procedures

(Continued From Page 1)

Program’ advises that stu-
dent records should not leave
the infirmary at all.

That information on those

records, the booklet added,
should not .be available to
anyone other than infirm-

ary personnel except where
the student gives written per-
mission otherwise.

Dean Burts observes in re-
ply that the booklet states
that “local conditions must
be taken into account” when
applying Association guide-
lines.

He maintains that the Da
vidson ‘‘close-knit” philoso-
phy is such a condition, and
that its application makes
the Association’s guideline
for ‘infirmary records inap-
propriate.

portions of the American

at Davidson?

As alternatives the social systems of Princeton
and Wake Forest serve as good examples of what
can be done. i

Princeton once had fraternities, but many years
ago abolished them through popular referendum. To
fill the social void, the school made available both a
stronger social calendar and eating clubs, operated
on-a-non-selective_basis.and open -to anyone and any.
number of interested students, For those students not
wanting to be tied down by a club, the university’s
administration made funds available for a very attrac-
tive campus student union.

Wake Forest is probably the closest to the David-
son situation. Wake still has fraternities, but. has
countered much of their attraction with an equally
attractive residence hall association program.

At Wake, where frats are residential, those who
choose not to join a fraternity are able to participate
in a very active residence hall program which sup-
plies its members with a full social life, athletic com-
petition, dating facilities, and all other benefits which
fraternities offer. Thus, the fraternity system at Wake
is not all encompassing socially as it is at Davidson,
but rather,is often outdone by independent dorm
residents. ?.

In conclusion, three points deserve to be reiter-
ated.

* First, the fraternity system as it presently exists
at Davidson needs drastically to be changed, both
because it is a bad system and because ‘it is dying
and its demise will leave Davidson with no social
system whatsoever.

Second, the new so¢ial system, whether it be
a more relevant and worthwhile fraternity system,
a more acceptable counter to the present fraternity

system through a stronger residence hall association
and-student-union,-or-a_totally. new-—social_institution,
must include all the. student body, and must give
meaning to the social endeavors of the entire David-

son community.

Third, an immediate change in Davidson’s social
system, presently based on ‘fraternities, is necessary.
