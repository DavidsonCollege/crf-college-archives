First Trip Monday
Five Games to be Played With
Leading Teams of This State

Three splendid trips are to be
taken by the Davidson quint this
;season. The first is a five-day tour
of North Carolina, beginning Mon-
day. The team will meet the fol-
lowing rivals in the order named:
_ Guilford, N. C. State, Wake Forest,
Carolina, and Elon. In the past two
1years the Wildcats have won only
one of the three games with Guil-
ford. N.C. State has not been on
the schedule and neither has Wake |
Forest. The University has won
games in ‘18 and '19, but dropped the
recent one Friday night. Jélon has
been successfully defeated in the
past two years. This will be a
hard trip as there. is much jumping
about to do on local trains.

The Virginia trip ought not prove
so tiresome on the team. The first
team of the Old Dominion will be
“Monk” Younger’s Hampden-Sidney
outfit, on the February 9, in Lynch-

-burg. Lynchburg club comes next.
Neither of these two teams have
been played in recent years. Jump-
ing to Lexington, the Wildcats meet
V. M. I. and Washington and Lee.
The former has lowered the local
colors for two successive years,
while it has been a split with Wash-
ington and Lee. The team should
be in fine shape for these games, two
in the Hill City, followed by two in

; Lexington.

The final trip will be through
South Carolina, beginning February |
23. The following colleges will be-
played: Wofford, Furman, Clem-.
son and University of S.C. The
first two and the last named have
not been met in the past two years.
Clemson was defeated in 718, but
was not scheduled last year. The
team will arrive back on the Fri-
day morning of Junior Speaking.

The three above trips are a trio
of extraordinary type and well
planned, so as to give the team every
possible chance for rest and the
Wildcats should be in first class
shape on all the trips. With any
luck at all, Davidson should win
more than the majority of the
‘games this year, but to bring the
‘hacon home the team and coach
;heed the wholchearted support of
; the student body. So get ready to
i send the team off with a boost Mon-
iday when it leaves for an invasion
of this State.

_R. O. T. C. to Aid in Recruiting for
Uncle Sam—Yellowstone Park
Trip Abandoned.

The War Department is desirous
of getting the R. O. T. C. to aid in
a recruiting campaign that is being
carried on throughout the United
States. The R. O. T. C. could give
_ exhibition drills, ceremonies, etec., |
that would mean trips to all nearby
towns. The band would of course,
ibe of much aid in this work. This
matter, however, must go before
ithe faculty to determine just how;
much the students will be allowed to
do. In the meantime all students:
are requested to make an effort to,
recruit for the army. This can be
done by making known the army/|
advantages, special stress to be.
placed on the vocational training
that is now given in all branches of’
| the service.

Due to the small number of stu-
dents who could go to the Yellow-
‘stone National Park for a summer
camp the matter has of necessity!
been abandoned. ;
| Students should begin to take,
‘steps to get ready for the summer
‘camp. The place of the camp has|
as yet not been determined, but will:
be announced later. |

The matter of taking the R. O. T.:
C. and Band to Winston for the

baseball game with Carolina is now

under consideration. This is one of
the big games of the season and Da-
vidson should be well represented.

It is hoped that as large or larger

crowd can go than was at the foot-

ball game last fall. The railroads

will be back in the hands of pri-

vate owners then and special rates
*|can in all probability be secured.
