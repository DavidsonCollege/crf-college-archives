OPINIONS _

MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1996

You know, in the past month
or so, a lot of people have said to
me, “Greg, your articles are al-
ways rude. Are you ever going to
write anything nice for a change?”

Now, it has never been my
intention to write anything mean-
spirited, spiteful, or hateful. I just
write a simple humor column that
tries to get us to laugh at ourselves
a little bit.

I can understand why some
people could take offense at my
sarcastic nature and ironic tone of
voice, and so this week I’ m writing
a nice article about my favorite
things.

If you’re a person who loves
feeling happy, you’re in fora treat.

I love going to Harris Teeter
and then getting in the express lane
with a 12 of Stroh’s and a package
of Hebrew National Kosher franks
— the absolute best on the market,
as far as this hot-dog connoisseur
is concerned — and then standing
in line behind a wo/man with 13 or
14 items, even though there’s a
sign which reads, “Ten Items or
Less,” hanging over his/her head,
as clear as day. r

I love the cashiers who are too

wimpy and soft-hearted to tell Mr.7

I love the fact that we’ve all
been ripped off by a Coke ma-
chine here at least once, but ifa
machine spits out two cans, we can

always ends up with a pocket full
of pennies.

I love’ most Davidson stu-
dents’ inability to dance, including
mine.

I love that they play “Sweet

at 1:30.

I love the way our director of
“public safety” can write off get-
ting drunk as an excuse for inex-
cusable behavior, even though al-
cohol merely lowers one’s inhibi-
tions and/or reveals what you’re

and that they won’t give a good

I love the fact
that we go to a Presby-

throw condoms off the
roof of the main aca-
demic building during
the big Christmas cel-

another student, stalking, rape, and
— as far as I know — murder are
not.

I love the fact that they don’t
sell cigarettes in the Outpost and
that they won’t give a good reason
for not doing so, even though sell-
ing them would please students,
make plenty of money for the
school, and radically reduce the
number of Davidson students
driving drunk to Cornelius on a’
Saturday night to pick up a pack
of Marlboros.

I love the way the Union café
has tax figured into its pricés, but
that all the prices end in a one,
two, three, four, six, seven, eight,

time in which you might

form some opinions.

Home Alabama,” which is an ut-
terly un-danceable tune, at every
Court party, but since none of us
can dance anyway, we don’t real-
ize that hopping up and down to
Lynyrd Skynyrd’s_ classic
redneck-rock anthem is anything
but dancing. :

I love the fact that we go toa

school which screams, “Celebrate .

Diversity,” fairly continuously and
which is situated in a town where
“the other side of the tracks” liter-
ally means the other side of the
tracks.

T love how parties’ just get
warmed up around 11 or 11:30,
and then how they shut the beer off

ebration, which is obviously not
tacky, inappropriate, or sacrile-
gious, seeing as how the birth of
Jesus Christ was all about keeping
casual sex safe, rather than recon-
ciling a sinful world to a loving
God, as Christians have claimed
for going on 2000 years.

I love liberals who hate con-
servatives because they’re nar-
row-minded and stupid, conserva-
tives who hate liberals because
they’re naive and stupid, religious
people who malign atheists be-
cause they’re going to hell, athe-
ists who malign religious people
because there’s no hell to go to,
teetotalers who are too morally

superior to hang out with drunks,
drunks who are too cool to hang
out with teetotalers, independents
who categorically dislike frater-
nity members, fraternity members
who categorically dislike inde-
pendents, people who think “get
involved” means “save the
whales,” people who think “get
involved” means “with some-
body,” and the fact that if I want to
hear The Dave Matthews Band, all
Ihave to do is set foot in a dorm.

I hope y’all have a great
holiday season away from this
lovely, happy,’ almost utopian
place, and while you’re celebrat-
ing Christmas, Hanukkah, and/or
New Year’s, remember three
things:

Regardless of how much
booze is in it, don’t drink egg nog
or anything so closely resembling
mucus, don’t eat the yellow snow,
and if Santa or Mrs. Claus drops
down your chimney and chucks a

- birth control device at you, don’t

whip out a shotgun and blow him/
her away.

Sure, you might be offended
as hell when a Trojan smacks you
inthe forehead, but you just haven’t
opened your- mind wide enough.
Mr. and Mrs. Claus are a man and
woman of the 90s, dammit.

I am writing to express my
disappointment at our recent
tree-lighting ceremony. We were
all dismayed by the fact that Santa
and Mrs. Claus didn’t rappel
down Chambers like they have in
the past. But what really

about sex. Telling people what
they want to hear so the AIDS
awareness movement will stay
popular won’t solve the problem.
It is a shame that the people in
that movement aren’t willing to
bite the bullet and ‘say

this Christmas, Santa
threw condoms, not
candy canes, from the top
of Chambers. That
seemed rather inappro-

the fact that many of the

would be resented). In-
stead, they have chosen
the easy way out, and
AIDS remains the sev-
enth most deadly dis-
ease in this country (ac-

That is all I wanted to
say. It was inappropri-

mood when while singing “It
Came Upon A Midnight Clear,”
condoms were floating down
from the sky. :

I assume that the reason
Santa’s bag was filled with con-
traceptives instead of toys and
candy is that this is AIDS Aware-
ness Week. Disregarding the in-
appropriateness of the whole
thing, in my opinion, the decision
to “deck the halls” with rubbers to
make us “aware of AIDS” was a
very poor one. “Safe sex” will
only work to a point. The best
condoms ‘fail about 1 out of 10
times. If we were really con-
cerned about solving the prob-

lem of AIDS, we need to get them
to stop having sex with partner
after partner. That is where the
emphasis should be.

It seems that whenever I hear
talks or see signs on AIDS, this
one vital’ solution is always
brushed over. Time and again, I’ll
see a comedian or someone with
his/her red ribbon on giving a
speech composed of jokes about
how many people they’ve slept
with or their last one night stand.
If we ever want to solve the AIDS
problem (and the many other soci-
etal problems that are caused by
promiscuity), we are going to have
to change the way society thinks

ate to have Santa pass out
condoms at an event celebrating
the birth of Christ. But what is
perhaps more upsetting is that this
was chosen as the focus for the
AIDS awareness activity that will
likely reach the largest audience.
All of us have heard from many
sources for a long time how im-
portant the use of condoms is in
slowing the spread of AIDS. Iam
simply proposing that if we are
really serious about working to-
wards a solution to this problem,
we should consider an alternative
measure that is clearly more ef-
fective than condoms. Think about
it.
