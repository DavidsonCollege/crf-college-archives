Westminster Group
Makes Church Study;
Seeks New Members

Believing that Christianity can
best be expressed through a de-
nomination, the members of the
Westminster Fellowship are try-
ing to learn how to be good mem-
bers of their own church.

They feel that there is a definite
need on the campus for specific
outlets for Christian faith, and that
being related to a denomination
gives them these outlets.

They have just completed a
series of programs on “What Is a
Christian?” and are embarking on
a study of the doctrines and gov-
ernmental structure of the Pres-
byterian Church.

The members are looking for-
ward to the convention of Presby-
terian students in Auburn, Ala-
bama, this coming December 29,
through January 1st. They are
studying books in preparation for
this gathering to which students
from all over the South will come
to study “The Christian’s Mission.”
All Presbyterian students are eli-
gible to attend the convention and
can enroll through their home
church.

President Leighton McCutchen
stressed that the organization has
a membership of participation and
that any student is welcome to at-
tend and take part in the work.
The membership of the organiza-
tion is divided into five areas of
concern: Faith, Witness, Outreach,
Citizenship, -and Fellowship.

The meetings are held on Sun-
day evenings at 6:30 in the Stu-
dent Lounge of the Davidson Col-
lege Presbyterian Church.

Maugham’s “Quartet”
Next Flick At Union

Somerset Maugham, master of
the short story, receives tribute in
the new Eagle Lion Films’ release,
“Quartet,” which makes one full-
length feature out of four of his
most famous short stories, and
which will have two showings Sat-
urday in the College Union at 7:00
p.m. and 9:00 p.m.

W. Somerset Maugham’s “Quar-
tet” was adapted for films because,
in the words of Sydney Box who
produced it for J. Arthur Rank, “1
have thought for a long time that
writers do not get sufficient prom-
inence on the screen.

Stars and directors—not to men-
tion producers—have so far cor-
nered most of the credit. ‘Quar-
tet’ tries to put the writer in prop-
er perspective as the most im-
portant single element in picture-
making; and what better example
could have been chosen than W.
Somerset Maugham?”

Many of his novels have been
brought to the screen, “Of Human
Bondage,” “The Razor’s Edge,”
“The Moon and Sixpence” to men-
tion a few—but until “Quartet,”
the writer himself has never ap-
peared in a picture. Here he de-
livers the prologue.

ISIG UPSILON TAPS:

HOLDS JOINT MEET

The Davidson Blue Pencil chap-
ter of Sigma Upsilon, honorary
literary fraternity, will hold a
joint meeting with the Queens Col-
lege Cakes and Ale chapter. This
joint meeting will begin at @ o’clock
tonight.

elected to membership in the or-
ganization at the October 29 meet-
ing in the Sigma Chi house. The

Ogden, Ed Stuart, Fred Myers,
Scott Ball, Bob Mims, Paul Pinck-
ney, Adolfo Cash, and Professor
Benjamin H. Wilson.

In addition to these new mem-
bers, Professor James Southall
Wilson, visiting professor of Eng-
lish, was extended associate mem-
bership in the chapter.

At an earlier meeting, October
15, held in the Green Room of the
College Union, Malcolm William-
son read his short story, “Exea-
vating on a Greek Ship.”

Sigma Upsilon projects include
another continued novel, in which
a different member of the frater-
nity writes each chapter. Also on
the project list is a booklet to be
entitled “Davidson Days of David-
son Greats.” This booklet will
describe the Davidson period in
the lives of famous graduates and
students.

“Father Damien,” a story of the
‘founding of Hawaii’s leper colony.

After his Navy discharge Wolfe

Michigan for his Master's degree

pearing as soloist with many of
the nation’s outstanding musical
organizations.

peared as soloist under James
Christian Pfohl at the music festi-
vals in Brevard and Asheville,

CONVERSE STORMED
AS BAND RETURNS
FROM FURMAN TILT

By WATT McCAIN

Even after the October 24 half-
time performance in Greenville
was done, the show went right on—
to Converse.

Davidson’s sixty sport-coated
bandsmen, returning through Spar-
tanburg from the Davidson-Fur-
man game, staged a surprise musi-
cal attack, glokenspiel and all, on
the serenity of Converse’s
autumned campus. And the Muses
themselves could not have made
more joyous serenades to the de-
lighted young ladies of the col-
lege.

Having assembled unusually
quietly outside their two Trailways
busses, the members blared out
with “O Davidson” and paraded
over the grounds, fronted by two
acting majorettes from Queens,
who were being hauled back to
Charlotte.

Director Kenneth Moore
tired to the shade of a tree.

The tooters noisily halted in
front of the main building where
a crowd of amazed females had
quickly gathered. With the band’s
playing their standard “Dixie,” the
girls’ amazement gave way to
sheer enjoyment.

After a few more marches, Ma-
son Field, Harry Orr, Dave Phaff,
Ed Price, John Shannon and Cur-
tis Ellison gathered round and
ad libbed “The Saints” in their
best Carnegie Halli Jazz Concert
style.

Although the band's repertoire
had been exhausted several times,
a suggestion that they leave met
with squeals of disapproval from
the audience. Dunbar Ogden final-
ly realized his wish and the musi-
cians were invited into the parlor
for an hour of fellowship.

DR. DEPP RETURNS
TO DAVIDSON FOR
SUNDAY SERVICE

Dr. Mark Depp is no stranger
to the Davidson campus. as he
has led special services similar to
those just completed as well as
regular preaching visits.

His extensive tormat education
culminated with an honorary Doc-
tor of Divinity degree from Al-
legheny College. Varied church
work in Virginia, Maryland, and
the District of Columbia was in-
terrupted by his service during
the First World War as an Army
chaplain. After the war, he served
in such large churches as St. Marks
in Baltimore, Calvary Church in
Washington, and Christ Church in
Pittsburg.

In October, 1945, Dr. Depp went
to Centenary Church, Winston.
Salem. Since then he has been
active in civic organizations, and
has been on several committees in
this community. The wideness of
his appeal is illustrated by the
fact that both pastor’s schools,
preaching missions, and summer
assemblies, such as Lake Juna-
luska, N.C... and  Massanetta
Springs., Va., have invited him as
guest speaker.

We welcome Dr. Depp to our

pulpit Sunday night.

CONTRACTORS PLAN
COMPLETION IN 1955

By HENRY BROCKMANN

Excavation for construction
of the $800,000 W. H. Belk
Hall began Wednesday morn-
ing of this week. Actual con-
struction is scheduled to begin
shortly, and Thompson and
Street, contractors, say that
the building should be com-
pleted in early 1955.

The huge edifice, scheduled to
house some 300 students, the
ROTC Department, and the rifle
range, will be located in the area
immediately behind Georgia Dorm- ©
itory. The area between it and
Chambers building will form a
quadrangle when Georgia has been
torn down.

ROTC Building Moves —

Before construction work can be-
gin, it -will be necessary to move
the present ROTC building and the
residence of C. W. Stacks, man-
ager of the laundry.

The ROTC building will be
moved to the present location of
the supply building, the supply
building being moved 60 feet to
the right. In the final plans these
two buildings will serve as shop
and storage building.

The Stack’s residence will be
moved across the road to the area
adjacent to the laundry.

During construction classes will
continue as usual in the ROTC
building. Treasurer Grier Martin
has announced that Crouch
Brothers of Mooresville, experts in
heavy moving, will move the
ROTC building with little inter-
ruption of activities therein.

The new dormitory will have -
four floors. The ROTC department |
will be located in the first base-
ment with the rifle range in the
sub-basement.

There will be a lounge on the
first floor, and Mrs. Little’s office
will be located on that floor.

In every dorm room there will
be a lavatory, built-in storage cab-
inets, two closets, and asphalt tile
floors.

The architect for Belk Dorm
was Raymond Weeks of Durham.
He was also the designer of the
gymnasium.

The contractor, Thompson and
Street, also built Duke Dormitory,
the Church, Ovens College Union,
Johnston Gymnasium, the Science
Building and the Library.

The structure is to be named
W. H. Belk Hall in consideration
of the long service of the late
Charlotte business executive as the
senior trustee of Davidson and of
the gifts of his family and business
associates.

More New Records

open for any suggestion that a
student might have about records,
so make your requests at the desk.

each time, but each suggestion will
be given due consideration.
