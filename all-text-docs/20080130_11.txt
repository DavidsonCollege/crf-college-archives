Brickhouse Adds Depth
to Davidson Bar Scene
Of the many fine local empori-

| ums licensed in the sale of spirits,

the sturdy yet modest
“Brickhouse” may be the best.
With the rustic atmosphere of an
abandoned warehouse, a staff of
busty maidens, and a richly provin-
cial clientele, this drinkery truly

| evokes the pastoral hoppiness of

the Carolinas.

These 21-year-old students kick it
in the 900 room, one of many
great local bars.

You’ll be charmed by
Mooresville swine, toothless vix-
ens, and lonely seniors so socially
nonexistent you thought they had
transferred years ago.

A mere stone’s throw from the
Brickhouse is the 900 Room, the
Union’s intimate conference center
by day, watering hole by night,
where the school’s more bibulous
seniors gather to indulge them-
selves in a few frothpuppies before
hitting the books, the sack or some
of the other great local bars. If you
feel like a night of pleasant conde-
scension, try the Korner Pub,
where you can survey an entirely
different milieu, one in which no
one knows half as much about
Alexis de Tocqueville as you do.

in 1997 to enslave Looney Tunes
as attendants for their outer space

competitively since they siphoned
the skills of NBA stars like Larry
Byrd and Patrick Ewing in the mid

Mississippi Freshman’s

Patriotism in Question

Regardless of your gender or
interest in news, sports and pop
culture, you've still probably heard
that the New England Patriots are
undefeated heading into this week-
end's Super Bow] match-up against
the New York Giants. You've also
probably noticed the increasing
number of Patriots jerseys, hats,
and other paraphernalia around
campus. The Pats bandwagon has
rolled through Davidson, and it's
swooped up quite a few students
along the way.

I happen to have a Psych class
with one of these “fanatics,” a
freshman who recently came to
class wearing a brand new, pewter
and blue Tedy Brushchi jersey.
Skeptical of his allegiance to New
England despite his Southern
accent, I approached him after
class last week.

I learned that he lives in
Mississippi, and when I pressed
him for the reason he follows the

, Patriots, he delivered an automated

response: “My aunt's ex-boyfriend
used to be a locker room attendant
for the team.”

Listen, buddy, whether or not
this far-fetched excuse is true, your
aunt probably goes through six to
seven boyfriends a year because
she's in her forties and seriously
desperate. I'm sure she started dat-
ing this guy in November, after the
Pats had crushed their first eight or
nine opponents and looked unbeat-
able.

You saw that as an excuse to join
the ranks of snobby New England
fans (since the closest teams to
your hometown are the 'Aints and
Falcons), and you bought the jer-
sey that is most popular among
teenage girls.

I don't care if you know the vitals
on each second-string offensive
lineman. So do eight year-olds in
Japan. Do us all a favor and take
off the jersey, soak it in kerosene,
and light it on fire. Better yet, keep
the jersey on.

been playing semi-pro in
Yugoslavia. Pound, the orange
heavyset Monstar who stole
Charles Barkley’s skills, has been
providing belligerent commentary
for local broadcasts of high school
games in the Charlotte area.

The Monstars got off to a great
start by draining Steph Curry’s
ability to shoot from three-point
range, as well as Jason Richard’s
court vision. Blanko, the moronic
blue Monstar, took Boris Meno’s
height, while his teammate Bang,
the towering green inferno with a
cleft chin and a flat top, took
Bryant Barr’s prized accolade of
Mr. Basketball. Even Mehmet
Civi’s break-dancing skills were
appropriated by Bukpus, the goofy
purple Monstar.

Blanko paced the Monstars with
42 points, while most of his team-
mates also reached double figures.
Pound, upset over a dubious dou-
ble-dribble call, ate the referee late
in the second half, at which point
the game was abandoned. Several
players of the pep-band, who
began taunting the Monstars with-
numbers from the Spacejam sound-
track, were also consumed.

A report from Officer Jaskson
cited the Monstars as drunk and
disorderly in the Outpost at 2:15
a.m. They responded by stealing
his police power and writing him
up.

At 87, Horace Adams finally
is too old for this shit enrolled in,
the biweek-

ly water polo class he needs in
order to graduate.

For years Adams had refused to
sign up for the last PE credit he
needed, purely based on principle.
As he indicated, “Didn’t need no
gulldurn water credit to storm the
beach at Normandy.”

The PE credit wasn’t all he need-
ed, however. Horace also lacks a
religion course, and he has enrolled
in Death, Dying and the Afterlife.
Students say his presence is a little
disconcerting, but they also say
that he adds an element of realism
and immediacy that otherwise
would be lacking.

“It would be especially profound
if he would die sometime this
semester,” Religion Instructor Trey
Fowler said. “His death would
provide some great food for
thought for the students’ reflection
papers.”
