CHINA AND JAPAN ARE
SUBJECTS OF DISCUSSION

Two foreign countries were dis-
cussed in the Volunteer Band meeting
last Sunday. First, M. P. Calhoun
spoke. China has one-fourth of the
population of the world, 93 per cent of
whom are illiterate, and seven-tenths
are in poverty, and only one out of
every 50 have any access to modern
medical treatment, he said. These peo-
ples, whose main religions are Con-
fucianism and Buddhsm, have had
their pride turned to humility, and now
are eager to learn.

Wallace Moore spoke with his char-
acteristic mingling of pride and au-
thoritativeness upon his native coun-
try, Japan. He told of their compul-
sory education, of their splendid medi-
cal profession, of their religions—
Confucianism, Buddhsm and_ Shin-
toism, and of their patriotism that lit-
erally makes a man want to die for his
country. The two parties-of Japan,
the military and peoples’ parties, form
about six per cent of the whole nation
of 70 millions of persons, Japan is
now in a crisis, as the peoples’ party
are striving to get the upper hand.
“Thus Japan needs immediate Chris-
tian attention lest she become a great
heathen power,” he sad.

Dr. Y. O. Chai, of Korea, was an-
nqunced to speak on Korea at the next
regular meeting.

ATTENDANCE AT BIBLE
CLASSES DECREASES

The Bible classes this week were
considerably broken up, both on ac-
count of the time of meeting being put
forward and because of the excitement
over the campus campaign being car-
ried on that night. The subject for
discussion was, “How Can Group-Life
Be Made Christian?” Doctor Currie,
in” addressing the leaders class,
brought out the fact that a group must
be touched through its individuals, for
the group is composed of indivduals,
and if all of them are reached then the
whole group will be.

A person’s success in Christianizing
a group cannot be estimated by his
progress with the group; David Liv-
-ingstone labored for 30 years among
the savages of Africa and at his death
had converted only two of them, yet
who would say that Livingstone was a
failure? Among the moral issues de-
pendent on group, settlement were dis-
cussed cheating and hazing. Although
the former was considered important
the latter was by far the most necessary
for group settlement on our campus,
Hazing was proven to be a moral issue
as it is against all laws, national, State
and college,

MINISTERIAL BAND
_ HEARS MR. LOCKHART

The members of the Ministerial
Band were fortunate in having Mal-
colm Lockhart, director of the Greater
Davidson Campaign, address them at
their regular. meeting last Sunday,
which was led by W. T. Baker, presi-
dent of the band. on

Mr. Lockhart first reviewed the
marvelous progress the world has re-
cently made, and then in contrast to
this showed that although the Bible has
not changed it still fulfills the needs of
every race of every age.

He read a passage from First Corin-
thians which showed that Paul, the
greatest writer of all ages, ranked

* teachers above miracle workers. The
world does not realize this fact, but it
is true that the greatest form of serv-
ice is that of serving as a spiritual
teacher.

The talk was concluded by briefly
commenting on the three Christian
graces, joy, peace and love. As verses
embodying these graces, Mr. Lockhart
quoted, “Thése things have I said unto
you that your joy might be full,” “My
peace leave I with you,” and “Love one
another.”

EVANGELISTIC MUSIC
IS LED BY ALLISON

As announced by Dr. Richards
some time ago, the Sunday night serv-
ices of the Presbyterian Church during
the fall months are being conducted as
evangelistic services. To help in this
work special song services of an
evangelistic nature are held prepara-
tory to each service. These services
are led by O, J. Allison, assisted by a
choir of eight or 10 selected voices.
Allison is well qualified to do this
work both by natural ability and ex-
perience. He has a voice well adapted
to the work and has had experience
both in the Glee Club and evangelistic
singing. These weekly services are
interesting and inspiring and are well
attended both by the town people and
the students.
