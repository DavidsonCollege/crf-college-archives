The President, in his proclamation,

says:
“Every day the great principles for
which we are fighting take fresh hold
upon our thought and purposes and make
it clearer what the end must be and
what we must do to achieve it.

“We now know more certainly than
we ever knew before why free men
brought the great Nation and Govern-
ment we love into existence, because it
grows clearer and clearer what supreme
service it is to be America’s privilege to
render to the world.”
