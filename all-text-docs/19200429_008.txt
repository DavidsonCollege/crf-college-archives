First Elon Game

In the final game of the trip the
Red and Black aggregation put
forth some classy work, backing
Currie splendidly, and the Wildcats
came out of the contest with the
long end of a 6 to 3 score.

“Buck” was in rare form, striking
out ten and walking two. Elon
gathered in six hits but they were
well scattered and at no time was
the result in doubt. Perry, for the

the “lucky seventh,” Trinity snatch-
ed an exciting contest from the
Wildcats by a 4 to 3 score. Brown,
on the mound for the Methodists,
pitched a masterful game, striking
out ten of the opposing batters.
The game started off like a big
leaguer and for the first three in-
nings no one was able to cross the
plate, although Trinity wasted a
chance to score in the first when
Salmon missed the hit and run play
and McCarther was run down be-
tween third and home. Davidson
scored two runs in the fourth on
two singles, a double and a sacri-
fice. Trinity got one in the fifth on
two singles and a sacrifice. David-

Elon 5.
cond Elon Game

Davidson trounced Elon for the
second time in the last three days
by a score of 3 to 0. This game
was a no-hit affair in which only 27
Elon batters faced Miley. Only one
of their men reached first and that
on error, but he was caught trying
to steal second.

The features of the game were the

pitching and hitting of Miley, who,
out of three times at bat connected
with a single, three-bagger, and
drew a walk, thereby making his
batting average for the afternoon
perfect. “Bill” had the visitors
guessing at all stages of the game
and the teamwork and support of
the other players was excellent. Al-
though the field was rather slow on
account of a light rain, the game
was full of thrills, fast, and cleanly
played.

The one-handed catch of Wrenn’s
liner behind third base by. Marlette,
the Elon shortstop, and the double
play following was the most sensa-
tional piece of fielding of the whole

game.

The Wildcats’ batting was hot and
heavy for of the six hits collected
two were three-baggers, two were
two-haggers and two were singles.
The Red and Black machine scored
as follows:

In the fifth inning McArn went to
first on his single and scored on
Miley’s three-bagger. Then the
squeeze play was worked by Cassell,
Miley scoring the second run. In
the eighth frame Crawford went
around to the hot corner on a three-
bagger and scored on Shepard’s
long hit to left. The box score:
