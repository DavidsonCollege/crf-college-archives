Revise Self- selection < -* ~«

By BILL BARNETT
Editorial Page Coeditor

At last week’s Interfraternity
Council meeting, an interesting pro-
posal was brought up. On the surface
it would seem to benefit only the
national fraternities; however, careful
consideration of the proposal will
reveal that it might be just the right
solution to cure the divisiveness in the
Davidson social system.

The proposal calls for several
changes in the self-selection system.
It would allow the national fraterni-
ties, as well as any eating house, to
give bids to freshmen, thereby invi-
ting them to become members in that
house. This may sound like a return
to the exclusiveness of the old
rush-bid fraternity system, but it’s
not because there is a Catch-22
written into this proposal.

The catch is the second part of the
proposal which says that bids can
only be extended to those freshmen
who have self-selected into the bid
system.

The new procedure, as put forth in
the proposal, would be as follows.
First, all of the houses on campus
would have the same informal rush
system which is in effect now. There
would be open houses and parties
until Christmas, and students would
be invited to eat at the various houses
all through winter term.

Then, about Jan. 15, the freshmen
would choose one of two options open
to them. They would either join the

bid system, or stay in the self-selec-
tion process. At this point the
fraternities would have a two week
period to extend bids to the freshmen
who had signed up with the bid
system. At the end of these two
weeks, about Feb. 1, the bid process
would be over, and all of the students
remaining on the bid list would revert
back to the self-selection process.

The self-selection process would
then be used to fill out the remaining
places in both fraternities and eating
houses.

The many merits of this system are
obvious. First, it wouldn’t force any
freshmen into the bid system unless
they wanted to be in it. Second, it
would give the fraternities a chance to
have some authority over who enters

their organizations. Not absolute |

control, but merely some authority.
These people, for the most part, are
proud of their houses and the people
in them. Thus, it seems only fair to let
them have some authority over who
should join a house which the
brothers have spent a lot of time and
money developing. Third, no house
would have to take part in the bid
process. If the eating houses, or the
fraternities, are happy with the
self-selection system, then they need
not even bother with the bid process.

The best part of the proposal
though, is that it would clarify the
whole self-selection mess. Instead of
whispered ‘‘encouragements’’ and
“‘discouragements’’ which leave the
freshmen confused and disheartened,
the whole process would be done out
in the open with a strong set of rules.
Everyone would know exactly where
they stood.

When the Council on Campus and
Religious Life begins its review of the
self-selection process, I hope it will
remember this proposal. Diversity
without division and hard feelings is a
hard thing to accomplish, but this
proposal would certainly be a giant
step towards that goal.

Letters to the Editor

Erwin article Superticial, putrid, bad

To the Editor:

As members of the Senate Course
Evaluation Committee we were dis-,
mayed last week to discover the
headline in The Davidsonian reading
“Return on Evaluations Disappoint-

ing: Students Fail to Assess
Courses.”

We were disturbed at the conc-
clusions left by the reporter, Charles
Erwin; in the mind of the reader. He
figst makes several misleading state-
ments, then, as a result of his
superficial investigation of the facts
his interpretation distorts both the
goals and the present state of the
SGA course evaluation effort.

First, students did not ‘‘fail’’ th
assess courses. Mr. Erwin fails in the

sense that he does not adequately

qualify his headline. The fact is that
for both fall and winter terms our
committee had roughly a 33 percent
response on course evaluations. Ad-
mittedly, we had hoped for a higher
percentage of responses the second
time around, but the fact that the
response was: almost equal for both
fall and winter term evaluations
certainly does not constitute a ‘“‘fail-
ure,’’ mean that the course evaluation
results were ‘‘totally meaningless’ or
place the future of the course evalua-
tion program ‘‘in jeopardy.”

The conclusion to be drawn from
this data is that the system of
distribution of the questionnaires
needs to be streamlined and made
more efficient. The fact that there was
a ‘‘low rate of return’’ cannot be
attributed solely to a lack of student
interest. If the committee sees any
area of ‘‘failure’’ it is in the limitations
of the present system which is wholly
dependent on student efforts.

Second, Thom Young is not the
person in charge of SGA course
evaluation, as the article implies.
That is obviously not his job. There
exists an active committee of the
senaté (made up of five persons: Jim

WDAV’s future??

DAVIDSON STUDENTS SRPEK

ACADEmic V.P,

FOR STUDENT

By PHIL IP’‘DUNCAN
nial Editor

Can the college administration
justify spending a considerable am-
ount of money to expand radio station
WDAV?

Yes, according to Buck Lawrimore,
Executive Director of WDAV and key
figure behind plans to expand WDAV
to 18,000 watts, because ‘‘we expect
the radio station will bring money to
the college.”

He told me that in February, Pres-
ident Spencer and other proponents of
the station agreed with Lawrimore.

I pondered the proponent’s ration-
ale: By investing in a radio station,
we send money in order to get money.
We spend x dollars on the radio
station, and the public relations
benefit of the station stimulates con-
tributions, bringing us the original x
dollars plus more money that could be
used in all areas of the college’s
development program.

After three months and numerous
interviews with Lawrimore, President
Spencer, Director for Development
Dittman, and student staffers of
WDAYV, I have found no one with
facts and figures to back up the
assertion that an expanded WDAV
will bring in more money than it
spends.

I have come to fear that the
proponents are considering operating
the station at a financial loss in
exchange for some nebulous ‘“‘image
improvement’.

Let us first consider how much the
radio station will cost the college.
Lawrimore drew up a proposal ex-
plaining the tentative plans to up-
grade WDAV and outlined a tentative
budget.

which is given the responsibility of
overseeing the distribution, col-
lection, and analysis of course evalu-
ation material and which understands
more fully the specifics of the course
evaluation effort. We are disap-
pointed that Mr. Erwin didn’t think it

necessary to seek out the committee’s
viewpoint on the issue.

Third, and most important, the
reporter confuses the goals of the
Senate Course Evaluation Committee
with the goals of the Professional
Affairs Committee. The immediate
goal of the senate committee’s work is
to publish a course evaluation hand-
book to aid students in the selection
of their courses. Along with this goal,
we hope to provide the faculty with
feedback on how students perceive
their professors’ effectiveness in
teaching a particular course.

On the other hnd, the PAC is
concerned with the use of student
course evaluations for administrative
purposes in relation to faculty tenure,
salary increases, etc. (among other
things.) This is an entirely different
issue. Mr. Erwin fails to make a

April 15, 1977

Its main points: The transmitter
and antenna system will cost $52,000
—this is essential to get on the air
with high power.

$21,000 will go for improvements in
the studio, considerable improve-
ments in ‘classical records and tapes,
testing equipment, miscellaneous el-
ectronic parts, and maintenance
equipment.

Cost of automated equipment—a
computer/tape deck system which
can store enough programs to operate
a station largely unattended for about
three days—would be $36,000.

Next, the yearly operating budget
—$28,000. That figure includes
$18,000 for salaries for a part-time
program coordinator, a part-time
broadcast engineer, and a part-time
secretary, as well as salaries for
students who stay on to broadcast
during holidays and summer months.
General operating expenses were lis-
ted at $10,000.

Lawrimore has since scaled down
this ‘‘improvements”’ figure to $5,000
-$20,000. To determine how much
should be spent over $52,000, he will
undertake ‘‘a careful evaluation of
existing equipment in the light of
whether or not it meets the high
quality level we want for the high
power station. The amount expended
on “‘improvements’’ will also depend
on available funds.

He has also scaled the general
operating expenses down to about
$7000 and the total yearly operating
budget to $25,000.

Let’s add the figures up to go to
high power. $52,000 is a ’’sine qua
non’’. But will that be all required to
get us on the air?

distinction between these two dif-
ferent uses of student evaluations and
the result is a misrepresentation of
both committee’s positions.

In the future, we hope Mr. Erwin
will be more thorough and responsible
in his journalistic endeavors. For the
present, we hope that we have been
able to clarify the nature of the senate
course evaluation committee’s work.

Note: The results for winter term
courses will be available by Wednes-
day, April 20. The committee has
acted upon the criticism of its last
evaluation and has worked to make
these results as accurate as possible.
