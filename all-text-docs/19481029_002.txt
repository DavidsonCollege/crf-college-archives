The pitiable plight of the peo-

fully to our attention in the film, ‘‘Seeds
of Destiny,’’ as, I think, all who saw it will
agree. Rather coincidental that the IRC
should. plan it for this date, but it certainly

was well timed.

The prevue of the ‘‘D’’ Club Foolies
served to help this very worthy cause and at
the same time provide a good entertainment
program for the student body.

In order for such a drive to be success-
ful, it must have the support of the entire
student body. This opportunity for aid to
Europe has passed, but there will be other
opportunities and we should see that. they
do not pass unrealized. These contributions
are our small, but important, way of mak-

little of its joys and comforts.

The results of this drive have not been
determined at.this writing, but we can re-
member that these conditions will not be
alleviated in the near future, and we can
see to it that future programs for furopean
aid receive our undivided support. Actually
little is asked of us, merely a small measure
of our abundant material wealth. If this
school and others like it would back drives
as the student body seems to have done this
one, conditions in Europe would be improved

immezrurably.

The discrepancy of justice lay
the minds of the Southerners
who had not yet learned to accept
the Negro as an equal, entitled to
equal protection of the law.

The Truman program would
guarantee to Negroes the right
vote. This privilege was granted
to them in the fifteenth amendment
to the Constitution of the United
Sates. The fact that they do not
vote freely in the Southern States

is due to prevention by the whites,
who have not yet learned to accept
the Negro as an equal, entitled to
equal suffrage.

We do not need laws to ‘bring

lem lies in education. We must edu-

cate the white Southerner to, look
upon the Negro as a political and

him as such. This does not mean
that black and white should mingle
together as one race. That is out
of the question. It means that the

Negro must be given an opportuni-

ty to go his own way in his own
society and among his own people,
to make good if he has it
within himself to de so. And if this
is to-come about, we must educate

the Negro to be an asset to
