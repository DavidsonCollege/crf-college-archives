Reform or revolution in the Soviet Union today?

Dean Rusk Program invites scholars to discuss changes in the U.S.S.R. under Gorbachev

By GEORGE LAFAYE

The Dean Rusk Program in Interna-
tional Studies will sponsor a confer-
ence entitled "Gorbachev's Soviet Un-
ion: Reform or Revolution” on October
10-12. Representatives from three
American administrations and several
colleges and universities will discuss
the extent of the current wave of
change in the political, economic and
social systems of the Soviet Union.

October 10 and 11 will each feature
two panel discussions with topics rang-

ing from “Soviet Foreign Policy” to
“Glasnost: The Impact on Society.”
Panelists include Tatyana Mamonova,
a Soviet expatriate from the Women’s
Research Institute at the Hartford Col-
lege for Women.

As the title suggests, the conference
aims to determine how radical a depar-
ture from past Soviet policies glasnost
and perestroika represent. In addition,
panelists will examine the role of the
West in a more open Soviet society by
examining prospects for increased

East-West trade.

Sessions run from a mid-morning
presentation on Soviet culture, after-
noon panel discussions and evening
speeches concerning different aspects
of changing Soviet society. These ses-
sions will be held mainly in Chambers
building with some panel discussions
in the Student Union. Davidson stu-
dents and the general public may at-
tend any of the presentations. A com-
plete list of activities and times is avail-
able from the Dean Rusk program.

For those wishing to learn more
about events in the Soviet Union before
the conference starts, the Dean Rusk
program will be hosting an open lunch-
eon September 27 featuring four mem-
bers of the Davidson community who
have recently visited the Soviet Union.
Jack Perry, director of the Dean Rusk
program, Dean of Faculty Robert Wil-
liams, professor of Russian Bonnie
Marshall and students Ramona Oliver
and Diedra.Moatague will share their
experiences with those interested.

The future for protesting
Chinese students is unsure

By MUADI MUKENGE

While in Washington,
D.C. this past summer, I met
with four Chinese students
who expressed anger and
disillusionment with the
turmoil in Tiananmen
Square. They have formed a
_protest organization and
thus have endangered their
lives. The following is their
story. |

Ping Li says that he and his
father often argue about poli-
tics- China’s politics. ‘His fa-

ther is a member of China’s..

- Communist Party. Li is pres-
ently in the United States pro-
testing the government which
ordered the June military
crackdown in Tiananmen
Square.

“We have a different ideol-
ogy,” stated Li, a Ph.D. candi-
date at George Washington

. University (GWU). “He
doesn’t want to see the crack-
down as a fact because he’s
been fighting for so many
years...fighting for an ideal
government.”

It is a conflict, of ideology
between the old and_ the
young, and Li is not alone in
expressing anger with his
homeland. He is a member of
the Alliance of Chinese Patri-
ots, an organization of Chinese
students enrolled in American

‘colleges and universities. The
group was formed following
the June 4 military crackdown
in Tiananmen Square which
claimed the lives ofan esti-
mated 5,000 students and civil-
ians.

According to their charter,
the Alliance seeks not to reject
communism, but to form a
more “democratic China”
one that tolerates freedom of
‘expression and of the press.

Through demonstrations,

seminars and conferences, the.
Alliance also-seeks to educate’

the American public about the
history being made in their
homeland.

Yet “home” is dangerous for
them now. Li and others inter-
viewed are afraid to return to
China for fear of imprison-
ment or even death. Their pro-

test activities in the United

Ai ey

States are being closely moni-
tored.

Since June 4, a total of 31
“counterrevolutionaries” --
those who played major roles
in the student protests--have
been executed by government
order. Hundreds more have
been detained for supporting
the pro- democracy move-
ment.

Said Gang Ke, “It’s almost
impossible for me to go back. I
have to stay here--I don’t want
to risk my personal life.”

Ke, a doctoral candidate at
the University of Maryland, is
married. He is trying to obtain
visas for his wife and son, who
are still in China.

Yaqin Zhang has a similar
dilemma. Also a student at
GWU, he was an associate
professor at the China Univer-
sity of Science and Technol-
ogy- One of his. friends is on
China’s “Most Wanted” list
and there is no word on his
present status.

Li feels that there is no doubt
he will be “wanted” as well in
the event that he returns home.

“If I go back,” he said, “I
doubt if I’ll be able to stay in
hiding. There are police every-
where. Friends might even
turn their backs on me.”

According to Li, fear has
even prompted some to turnin
family members to the police.

By the same token, people
are extremely reluctant to di-
vulge information to the press
or to family members abroad,
says Ke. When he called his
parents in Beijing, they hardly
talked to him, although he
knew from friends that they
had witnessed the massacre.

The Alliance managed to
obtain pictures of the massacre
which were smuggled out by
friends. To avoid China’s mail
censorship, they invested in a
fax machine to send reports of
the crackdown to contacts in
Beijing.

Says Li, “Chinese papers
don’t tell you anything. You
don’t see the tanks moving in
on people on television over
there. Some people outside of
Beijing don’t even know ex-
actly what's going, on,”

What is going on in China?
Why.did the June 4 military

- crackdown take place?

Zhang, Ke and Li conclude

that Deng Xiaoping, China’s
senior leader, is exercising his
power to reemphasize that the
economic freedom he initiated
in 1976 was not a precedent to
political freedom. He made
that point very strongly by
using tanks on “ordinary
people” for the first time in
modern Chinese history,
stated Li.

“Deng is the only controller
[of China],” said Ke, “and he
wants to keep it [that way].”
The Communist Party, prime
minister and commander of
the army are all subordinate to
Deng’s wishes, he added.

According to Zhang, Deng

has not always exhibited the _

narrow-minded: and ruthless

_ qualities which resulted in the

Tiananmen Square deaths. In
fact, as successor to Mao
Zedong in 1976, he initiated
the free enterprise system and
dissolved communes. He also
abolished a decree which had
forced one student's father, a
native Taiwanese, to do hard
labor because he was regarded
as a potential traitor to-China.

Zhang and Li thank Deng for
widening opportunities--such
as university admittance--to
all citizens, regardless of social
status.

“Deng was highly réepected
then,” says Li. “He was called
the “Savior.”

However, Deng is unwilling
to widen the political arena
beyond the gerontocracy of the
Communist Party. He has fur-
thermore ridden the party of
pro-reformists. Those who
watched with hope as Deng
made no move during months
of protest were shocked into
the reality of his resolve to ref-
use demands for greater politi-
cal freedom.

But while Deng wields an
iron hand, the future of about
75,000 Chinese students in the
United States is unclear. The
Bush Administration has ex-
tended their visas for one year=
-a year during which Deng can
be watched from afar. But
what will happen when that
time runs out? Li, Ke and
Zhang are afraid but will nev-
ertheless persist in their work.

Until the last decade, it was
an “honor” tojoin the Commu-
nist Party, acknowledged Li.

“Now it is a disgrace.”

_ without the use of theS.A.T.
_ “We conclude that we do
not make better decisions
without both S.A.T.s and
Achievement Tests, but

given the multiple lenses of
| a highly selective college
and the restriction of
range,” he wrote.

In its 1987 article “Some
Colleges Rethinking Value
of S.A.T.s,” the Washington
Post reported that College
Board officials acknowl-
edge that {grades area better
predictor of academic suc-
oe: than S.A.T.s. But they
sue that grades and
oie “combined

optional S.A.T.shas not had

“ones that can be as good,
' students with substantially

-caused the entire class

since the decision, with sig-
“nificant geographic diver-—

Hiss, however, is con-
vinced that the move to

a negative impact on the
quality of Bates’ applicant

“They [those students
who did not submit S.A.T.
scores] have performed al-~
most as well as submitting

higher scores, and have

grade-point average to rise
markedly,” he said.

Hiss also noted that Bates’
optional S.A.T. policy has
attracted a larger and more
diverse applicant pool.
“The pool has increased 17.3 -
percent in the two years

sity, minority applications
and as ney oors: 4“

up for what they believe in a
crowd, where they may now
be reluctant to do so.”

“Many times, all it takes is
moral courage on the part of
one person to prevent a situ-
ation from getting out of
hand,” he added.

The student reaction to the
program is mixed. Those par-
ticipating in Davidson Plus
seem less than enthusiastic,
mainly because they feel over-

eo o oe

whelmed by the time commit-
ment. Several students also
complained of a lack of organi-
zation and spoke of never
knowing when their next ses-
sion would meet.

To the other freshmen on
campus, Davidson Plus is —
thought of as an elite group
and the purpose of the pro-
gram is not clear to them. The
administration is confident,
however, that once the pro-
gram settles down into a rou-
tine, Davidson Plus will be a
positive experience for all.
