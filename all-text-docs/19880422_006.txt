My name is Fish
I talk real fast
I run real fast
My name is Fish

My name is Fish
I need some cash
It goes real fast

Help me get cash

My name is Fish
I sleep all day

I work all night
The papers rush

My name is Fish

I drive real fast

If a dog is

in the car be-ware.

-Will Mitchell ‘88

i Ode to Chocolate

Oh, my beloved, tempt me no more;
Ihave not the strength to resist your allure.

Enticed from attempts at my waistline's reduction

I succumb to delights of your sensual seduction.
Varieties surround me; the selection is vast

And each one inveigles me more than the last:
Curvy smooth frosting, the waves of thick goo;
Provocative warmth of a dripping fondue. .
Steaming hot cocoa with whipped cream on top
Comforting tenderness fills every drop.

Hot fudge, you’re my weakness, and I must confess,
Like ice cream Ill melt from your gentle caress.
Boxed candy delights epicurean tastes

Each morsel enveloped by chocolate embrace.

A mouthful of ice cream’s a sapor to savor,

A delectable delight in my favorite flavor.

For my lips enjoyment there’s no sweeter bliss

Than the moment when Hershey will give me a kiss.
Oh, glorious chocolate, voluptuous confection
Forever you'll have my impassioned affection.

The Bodhi Desk

There I was,
Sitting in a tree
that was my desk,
contemplating Buddha

in a pile of shit.

I saw myself
a fly, a thousand lenses,
seeing nothing, |
buzzing on in search
of Buddha, truth,
and shit.

From stagnant, stinking stupor,

The Denial

The knobby contorted grasping claw

Reaches out from beneath the thick dense mass

Of a formidable vast oceanic realm.

With the turbid, oozing, rich liquid streaming down
The monstrous, bulgingarm of its controller,

The beast strives to grasp the areas beyond its reach.

Nothing to grip, nothing to sustain, nothing, nothing,

The creeping salty concoction swarms up the

Limb's fleshy length, vessels bulging and screaming;

And the disturbed network of waves folds back in place,

Allowing the gates below to open, their hinges moaning, L
Their rocky monuments vibrating in disturbance,

Their stronghold awaiting the last of the hurled ones.
