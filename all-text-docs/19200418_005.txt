J. M. Dunlap, Editor.

If Charlie Vance and Joe Walker,
while communicating with their
spirit friends, would get some good
“spots” on our profs we would be
much obliged.

Host, to John Gaston (after pour-
ing him three glasses of water): “If
you were much drier you'd be
dusty.

“Trusting to luck” he went on class:
Oh my, but this story is sad—

He had his luck, but there alas,
The luck that he had was bad.

chance to be a hero at Saturday’s

fact that April 1 was well named.

When your girl “kicks” you, you

Military Life A La Fresh.

I. Bayonets, when not fixed, are
always carried in the watch-pocket.

II. Prompt obedience to com-
mands shows submergence of indi-
viduality. Assert your personality.

III. Keeping step is a very vi-
cious practice and should never be
engaged in.

IV. Always talk and glance
around when at attention, otherwise
you may get lost.

. My general orders are:

1. To take charge of this post
and immediately go to sleep.

2. To walk my post in almost
any manner so long as it does not’
run away from me.

3. To violate all orders I am in-
structed to enforce.

§. To quit my post whenever I!
feel like it.

6. To conceal, disobey and keep
all orders from everyone.

To talk to everyone at all
times, even if I find it necessary to
leave my post to find the second.
party. '

8. In case of ladies on the cam-
pus to give the alarm.

10. In cases not covered by in- |
structions to make instructions. |
11. To salute only when ordered

to do so.

12. To be especially careful at
night to always retire at an early |
hour and to allow no one to disturb |
my slumber. |

Say what you please, O love sick
friends
About only one called “dearest.” |
But facts point out that all depends
Upon which one is the nearest.

How to Win a Maiden’s Affection |

Op.

I. Tell her she is the only girl
you ever think of and at the same,
time imply that your affections cov- |

and the dew cover Dixie.

II. Give her the idea that you
have far more sense than you really

possess, otherwise your case is
opeless.

II. Take another girl out on
some occasion occasionally: a bas-
ketball game for instance. This is
productive of jealousy—that “sine
quo non” of all love affairs.

IV. Write to her sometimes and
do better along the line of spelling
than we are doing on this: also use
a less punk pen.

V. Make use of the paper of
every organization to which you, or
your friends, belong, or can steal.

VI. Try to tell the truth in your
letters. It inspires confidence.

VII. When calling take candy
when possible: also do not stick the
box in your pocket upon leaving.

VIIl Do not wear Hard Boy
shoes: also leave before 1 o’clock.

IX. If (1920) she should propose,
tell her to file her application to be
considered along with the rest.

Good News For Any Editor.
(Including Ours.)

The Editor died and went to,
Heaven.
But stood outside the gate,
Because he hadn’t the nerve to
knock.
And thought that he could wait
Till some other mortals came
along;
He'd see what they would do,
And if they entered the pearly
gate
He thought he might slip thru.
He watched the vast precession
pass
Up the portals wide ;
While Peter told some they were
up too high,
And others he took inside.
The editor, weary of waiting so
, long,
Finally got in line,
To see if Peter would accept him

ANATOMICAL QUERIES.

Where can a man buy a cap for his
knee?

Or a key to the lock of his hair?

Can his eyes be called academies,

Because there are pupils there?

In the crown of his head what
jewels are found?

|

Who travels the bridge of his nose? |

Can he use when shingling the roof
of his mouth,

The nails on the ends of his toes?

Can the crook of his elbow be sent
to jail?

If so, what could he do?

How does he sharpen his shoulder
blades?

Ill be hanged if 1 know, do you?

Can he sit in the shade of the palnts
of his hands?

Or beat the drum of his ears?

Does the calf of his legs eat the
corn on his toes?

If so. why not’ grow corn on his
ear? —The Log.

His eyes filled to the brim.
He shivered and shook in agony.

Why, certainly, you may come

For all you did was write.”—

You who dislike our humble verse
Try your hand—it might be worse.
“The Sling.”

It might be worse we must agree
But fail to see how that could be.

Most any school kid, over ten
Could better use the poet’s pen.

So take a bit of advice frank
And cease to “Sling” us verse so
rank,

The beauty of writing for the
Peanut Parcher is that you are not
expected to tell the truth. The big-
ger the lie the longer the laugh.

“They are putting new hoards in
the side of that old warehouse.”

“Yes and the rent will be made
worse.”

“Miss Smith, let me introduce Mr.
Hanrahan.”

“Glad to meet you Mr. Hand, and
do you know I have a brother named
Henry too.”

He sat beneath the full moon fair,
His darling in his arms ;
He loudy praised her purchased hair
And artificial charms.

But fake of fakes—a breeze arose,

The sky began to leak

The hair was blown from off her
head

The paint washed off her cheek.

cline.” | Except once ;

By a gentlemen, too,

He put me on

To a good thing;

It was an envelope—

Perfumed, pink, square.

I've been stuck on

That envelope

Ever since.

He dropped us—

The envelope and me—

Through a slot in a dark box;

But we were rescued

More’s the pity.

He hit me an awful

Smash with a hammer.

It left my face black and blue.

Then I went ona long

Journey

Of two days,

And when we arrived—

The pink envelope and me—

We were presented to

A perfect love

Of a girl,

With the stunningest pair

Of blue eyes

That ever blinked.

Say, she’s a dream!

Well, she mutilated

The pink envelope

And tore one corner

Of me oft

With a hair pin;

Then she read what

Was inside

The pink envelope.

I never saw a girl blush

So beautifully !

I would be stuck

On her if I could.

Well, she placed

The writing back

In the pink envelope,

She kissed me,

Oh, you little godlets!

Her lips were ripe

As cherries

And warm

As the summer sun.

We—

The pink envelope and me—

Are now

Nestling snugly

In her bosom!

We can hear

Her heart throb;

When it goes fastest

She takes us out

And kisses me.

Oh, say,

This is great!

I'm glad

I’m a stamp—

A two-center. :

CONSOLATION.

The world is so full of the wonder-
. ful ladies :
Who smile with the radiance,
known of the sun;
The world is so full of remarkable
ladies
Who wield the combined power of
heaven and hades
It’s really absurd to go daft about
one. |
t
If Fate hands the ardent admirer a’
twister
And “she” throws him down with
a dull, sick’ning thud,
He ought to forget her and go find
her sister—

For sisters she has by the millions,

oh! mister,
each is as charming and
pretty a bud.

And

Now some one has said, and there’s
quite a lot in it,
That women, like trolley cars,
keep going by ;
If one hides her heart so you really
can’t win it
Another will be right along in a
minute—
You only lose time when you
mope and you sigh.

So be not discouraged at her fare-
well letter,
Cheer up, saddened swain, there is
hope still for thee.
The one you went batty about when
you met her
You're probably lucky that you
didn’t get her,
And there are more girls than the
sands of the sea.

—trx.

As the bleachers would have it,
we may have a “Cop,” a “Caruso,”
a-“Vernon,” ete.. but we don’t boast
of a “Grandpa” as the Oak
Ridge nine. (Apologies to Mr, Cox).
