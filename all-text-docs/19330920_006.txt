Glee Club Holds

First Practices

New Director Begins Work With
Many Experienced Men
Reporting

Mr. Pfohl, director of music

at Davidson, has already held tryouts
for this year’s Glee Club and has
conducted two practices this week.

Sixty-six boys have had tryouts and,
from all appearances, it looks as if
the Glee Club, under Mr. Pfohl’s di-
rection, is going to be an unusually
good one. A goodly number of these
are old members who will form the
nucleus of the new club. They will
hold two practices a week, from five
to six o'clock on Monday and Wednes-
day. Several good trips have already
been arranged and others are being
worked on.

The officers for this year are as fol-
lows: J. T. Blair, president; D. P. Mc-
Lain and L. D. McPhail, vice-presi-
dents; Carlton Chapman, librarian, and
D. W. Hollingsworth, Jr., business
manager.
