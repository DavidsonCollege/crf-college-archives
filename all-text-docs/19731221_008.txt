MERRY CHRISTMAS
The Editors and staff of THE DAVIDSONIAN wish every-

one a happy holiday season.

... Union Violates

(Continued from page 1)

‘‘I think it’s been clear up until
now that the Trustees do not
want to get into the business of
selling beer.’’ Spencer
stressed the college position
that permits students to use
alcohol although not en-
couraging its use.

“When the college gets into
dispensing beer, you're taking
it a step beyond the individual.
The school now has a stake in
it. You’re in a position of
almost encouraging the use of
alcohol. I think this becomes
an institutional rather than an
individual decision at that
stage. ‘‘I don’t think that the
union has any obligation to run
an open bar,’’ Spencer said.

Bruce’ indicated the
desirability of having a license
when the Union moved to the
new facility in Grey Library.
“I think next year sometime
would be the best time for us
to seek a license,”’ he said.

He mentioned certain ad-
vantages of sale of beer at the
Union. He also felt that the
sale of beer was in effect, a
control measure.

to be a trial year, so to speak,
for the program's recruiting
status. We want to see what
results we can get and what it
costs to achieve them."’

He indicated that the college
is particularly interested in
seeing whether or not David-

recruit the talent necessary to
make it a major college
power.

“I have heard the rumors
that we are not spending
enough money to recruit on
the major college level,”
Spencer admitted. ‘But I
have not seen any figures or
results of a study concerning
the matter."’

The ‘‘rule of reason” ap-
proach that the college is
taking toward the program
this year will be carried out

under the close supervision
of Athletic Director-designate
Dr. Thomas Cartmill.

‘The amount of money that
basketball will be able to use
us by no means unlimited,”’
Spencer pointed out. ‘But
they are not bound by a fixed
budget, if they need more.”’

The preliminary policy ex-
pressed the hope that the
Wildcat Club would help in the
recruitment funding if the
team spends more than the
college has allotted.

‘‘People are a lot less likely
to bring liquor to a college
union function if we have free
beer or beer at little cost. We
have shown by our experiment
with the contribution system
that we're not in this to make
money. It’s a student ser-
vice,”’ said Bruce.

Bruce explained that the
College Union had lost better
than $300 in giving away beer
under the contribution plan.

“The ABC people were

really nice, but you get the
feeling you're really getting
checked up on all the time,”
Bruce explained.

“From now on, we’ll just be
giving beer away on special
occassions.”’

Spencer supported the con-
cept of giving away beer at
parties and other special func-
tions. “‘I think a party is a lit-
tle bit different from an open
bar situation,’’ he said.

Make this
a Christmas shared

Remember all the Christmases
You've shared throughout the years,
With friends and loved ones

It didn't matter where you were
As long as they were there,
And thinking of each other

If you've ever loved somebody

Or if you've ever cared,

Send a Hallmark card this Christmas
and make it a Christmas shared.
