Only Dinner Only at

Patterson Court Houses?

Dinner continued from page I

interaction that is being discussed
by the committee is establishing a
“dinner-only” system at the eating
houses and fraternities. In this
plan, only dinner would be served
at the houses, with students eating
breakfast and lunch elsewhere on
campus. According to Howard,
this would “break away from the
‘segregation’ of males and females
that results from the current eating
house and fraternity systems.”

Petty says that, although this
dinner-only plan is still in its
formulative stages, she has re-
ceived very positive feedback
about it from members of the
women’s eating houses. Petty be-
lieves that it is likely that some or
all of the women’s houses will
implement the plan next semester,
hoping that the fraternities would
follow suit in the upcoming se-
mesters.

Although she is unsure of the
fraternities’ reactions to this plan,
Petty says, “even if they don’t do
it, it will still be beneficial to the
women’s houses and will give us a
chance to interact with others,”
such as independents, BSC mem-

bers, freshmen, and athletes who.

eat in the Commons. House mem-
bers would retain the opportunity
to eat with their friends in their

respective houses at dinner each
night, Petty says.

The committee plans to dis-
cuss eating options with Carleton
Pritchard, and hopes to include,
along with the Commons, the
Union and the Outpost as places
where students can eat their meals.

The ultimate goal of the din-
ner-only plan, says Petty, is “to
provide a chance for males and
females to interact socially with-
outalcohol.” She, along with many
others, believes that this would help
alleviate tension between genders
that is often felt at Davidson.

Another action taken by the
Patterson Court Women’s com-
mittee is to begin monthly discus-
sions hosted by the women’s
houses, involving faculty, staff, and
students. Petty says that the goal
of these discussions is to “improve
faculty, staff and student relations,
and to provide a support system, as
well asan outlet for discussion, for
women at Davidson.”

The first event will be at
Connor this Thursday, March 4, at
7:00 p.m. The discussion, spon-
sored by all three eating houses,
will feature Dr. Susan Hooks of the
English Department. Her speech,
“Measuring Success: A Different
Standard for Women?” will be fol-

lowed by an open discussion, to _

which everyone is invited.

Female Admitted, Then
Rejected, by The Citadel
CHARLESTON(CPS) - Shannon
Richey Faulkner was accepted,
and then rejected by The Citadel
after it was determined her high
school transcripts had been al-
tered to delete all references toher
gender.

The Citadel, a state-run mili-
tary school in Charleston, allows
no women in its corps.

Faulkner, 18, of
Powdersville, SC, applied to The
Citadel and had officials at Wren
High School use correction fluid
to delete all gender references.
She was provisionally accepted
pending final transcripts, and then
Citadel officials realized
Faulkner’s transcripts had been
tampered with.

“We received a transcript in
connection with an application for
admission into the corps of cadets
that had been masterfully altered,”
said Maj. Rick Mill, a Citadel
spokesman. “The admissions poli-
cies of The Citadel are quite clear

and the applicant does not meet the
standards of admission.”

Use Your Amex,

Feed the Hungry

NEW YORK(CPS) - American
Express student members who use
their charge cards between March
and April will be helping to feed
the homeless, officials with the
financial and travel company said.

The program, Million Meals,
will last from March 15 to April
30. Every time college students
use their American Express charge
cards to purchase anything, the
company will donate a meal to
Share Our Strength, a Washing-
ton-based hunger relief organiza-
tion.

American Express hopes to
be able to donate enough money to
pay for 1 million meals, said Andy
Sibert, senior manager for the
American Express student card
division.

New SAT Exam Planned
NEW YORK(CPS) - The Scholas-

tic Aptitude Test may have anew
name when a redesigned form of
the test is introduced in the spring
of 1994,

Critics say that the word “‘ap-
titude” misleads high school stu-
dents and their parents into be-
lieving the test is analyzing some-
thing innate or immutable when
they take the college entrance ex-
amination, said Robert Seaver,
spokesman for The College Board.

Additionally, an academic
study recommended a new name
because the redesigned test won’t
include the antonyms section and
will have a longer reading section
that requires students to come up
with conclusions. In the ‘math
section, the students will have to
generate their own answers in-
stead of picking an answer.

Suggestions forthe new name
include the Scholastic Achieve-
ment Test, the Student Attainment
Test and the Student Assessments
for Transition. Seaver said no
decision has been made yet on
whether to rename the SAT.
