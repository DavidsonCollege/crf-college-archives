COMPULSORY MILITARY
TRAINING BANISHED

(Continued from page 1)
optional as soon as possible.”

“'The Synod, therefore, calls to the
attention’ of the Presbyteries the above
action of the General Assembly and
asks that appropriate action be taken
to carry out the intent of the Assem-
bly’s deliverance in reference to com-
pulsory military training at Davidson
College.’

“T have had no official report from
the Presbyteries, but I note in the Min-
utes that Fayetteville Presbytery passed
the following resolution at its fall
meeting: ‘The Fayetteville Presbytery
goes on record as opposed to military
training at Davidson College on the
ground that it does violence to the
spiritual function of the Church be-
cause it is contrary to the spirit and
teachings of Jesus Christ.’

“It is not my purpose to discuss
again the merits or demerits of mili-
tary training at Davidson. However,
I feel that it is my duty to call your
attention to these resolutions which
have been passed by these Church
Courts, and also to call your attention
to the fact that the question of ‘com-
pulsory military training in our schools
and colleges has become a subject of
sharp controversy in our Church
Courts and in the papers. Tle Gen-
eral Assembly, a number of Synods,
and quite a number of Presbyteries
have passed resolutions calling upon
Chtirch schools and,colleges to discon-

tinue compulsory military training, and
some of these resolutions, as indicated
above, are addressed specifically to
Davidson College.

“These discussions and controveries
are bound to affect the college if they
continue. Nor can we properly or
safely ignore the resolutions of these
Church Courts which represent the
constituencies from which Davidson
College draws her students. Davidson
College needs students and needs
friends. We cannot afford to close
our doors in the face of students who
would like to come to Davidson but
do not want military training. Nor
can we afford to alienate the friends
of the college who are opposed to
compulsory military training. We are
face to face with a condition and not
a theory. Some of the friends and
patrons of Davidson want their sons
to have military training, and some
are opposed to it. We should try, with
open minds, to find a solution for this
problem. I am making a recommenda-
tion which I think will partially solve
it. If a better solution can be found,
I shall welcome it.

“T therefore recommend that in the
future administration of R. O. T. C.
at Davidson those students be excused
from military training whose parents
or legal guardians so request. It is
understood that such requests must be
made in writing and filed with, the
registrar prior to the opening of the
college, and in no case later than ten
days after the opening of the session
of the college. It is also understood
that when a student enters upon the
course of military training he is under
obligation to take the course for the
first two years, unless he be excused
for physical reasons, or by the Mili-
tary Department of the United States
Government.”

Last_year_ the freshman team was
able to complete its season without
the loss of a single meet, and, while
it is a bit doubtful if this year’s yearl-
ing squad can equal this record, still
Coach Whittle is hoping for a good
showing from the first-year men.

FIRING AT RANDOM

DAVIDSON TRUSTEES HOLD

pleted without a deficit. This has been
accomplished by a reduction in the
budget of $40,000 under what it was
four years ago. After the treasurer’s
report, the trustees adjourned for
luncheon with the faculty.

James Christian Pfohl, who has been
acting as part-time director of music,
was elected as full-time director of
music and organist for the college.
The trustees also authorized the fac-
ulty to give such academic credit to
deserving work done in music as might
seem wise. No decision has been
which credit will be given.

Professors. A. V. Goldiere, of the

French Department, and J. T. Kim-
brough, of the Mathematics Depart-
ment, were granted one year leaves of
absence’ for graduate work.” The ad-
ministration was authorized to secure
suitable substitutes for these pro-
fessors.

It was decided that a comprehensive
program for the celebration of David-
son’s centennial anniversary should be
prepared, although no further plans
were made at the time. Founders’
Day was set for April 12, at which
time the whole of the contennial pro-
gram will be given publicity.
