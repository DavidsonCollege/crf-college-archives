Over a period of years these gifts
have been made for widely varied
purposes. Sometimes they have been
for causes close at home. In recent
years the gifts have been directed
toward our Negro Work, for the
Student Room in the contemplated
new church on our own, campus,
and other like causes.

“This year it seems highly ap-
propriate that it should be for one
of those much more needy
than our own. At a when

bless them that curse you; do good
to them that hate you, and pray
for them that despitefully use you
and persecute you,” is the injunc-
tion of Christ Himself. It is not
unlikely that a gift sent at this
time to restore a °Y.M.C.A.
destroyed in the recent war with
Japan will do more to testify to the
Christian gospel and to interna-
tional understanding and good will
than very much**more spent on
other objectives. It is appropriate
that ous Y.M.C.A. should build
another. Y.M.C.A. to become

thusiastic response and furnish us
the same inspiration as have pre-

Students Comment
Qn Appropriateness

Of ‘Y’ Gift Fund

“The YM¢

\’s annual gift fund

drive is, | believe, just another way
of de:

times

lonstrating what we some-

casually refer to as “David-

son spirit.” It would be difficult for
any individual student to explain to
any one person or group of people

just what_this spirit. we. speak of

is. Through this gift fund, how-
ever, in which all of us can par-
ticipate, at least to some extent,

the Student Body as a unit has an

opportunity to help rebuild_a needy
nation and to give them a working
example of what we mean by. the
Spirit of Davidson.”

“i'm glad the cabinet has chosen’

‘Y’ work in Japan because I feel
that this campaign will help to
strenthen the tie between our col=

lege and the colleges in Japan, be-

tween our ‘Y’ here at Davidson and

the Y.M.C.A. in the Far East
Being able to disseminate Chris-
tianity through the ‘Y’ makes this

project an especially desirable one’

ni iu

\s we stand on the threshold of

the Christmas season, the annual
Y.M.C.A. Gift. Fund . gives the
Davidson student an opportunity to
fill a greyioeus need in a land

a hollow

mockery. Through the medium of
the ‘Y’ Fund, we may bring tl
message of Christianity to Japan,

jan area suffering from material and

spirttual impoverishment

Using past years as a criterion,
there is every evidence to believe
that each student will contribute
generously, thus=assuring the sue-
cess of the 1947 Christmas Gift

Fund."

ie
The present certainl? seems to
be the most opportune moment for

the Christianization of Japan. The
tremendous influence which Shin-
toism once had on the Japanese

people has \been shattered, but as’

has been offered the
people of Japan to fill the spiritual
vacancy that is in their lives. They
are virtually without a god of any
kind, and it seems only natural to
believe that they will most readily
accept the religion of the Ameri-
cans who have given them a new

yet nothing

freedom. But if we wait conditions
may be quite different. As Bob
Wallace—weites—from the Foreign

Mission Headquarters in Nashville,
the harvest is ripe now. Surely the
place is Japan and the time is the
present.”

believe that

good will, not armies, is the best

“For those who
instrument for world concord, the
Christmas Gift Fund is an excellent
medium through which to express

this conviction, Although real suf-

fering is almost incomprehensible
to us pampered Americans, surely
the least we can do is to’ make
some sacrifice to show our con-
cern for Christian students less
fortunate than we. What will we
get out of it? That is an irrelevant
question, The Christian query is:
How can we do so little?”

tt While the past years have
witiessed™ cruelty and @x-

that the Y's men’s activities ,are

in overcoming the vicious cruelty
that has been drilled into the hearts
and minds of the Japanese people
... The influence of such organiza-
tions,as the Y’s Men's Club is an
essential in.these days

PASTOR SPEAKS

The “Y” Cabinet has again
offered to the Student Body a
very worthy and challenging
project for the Annual Gift
Fund. The ‘fact that the “Y”
Building is near a university
campus and located in Japan
will make a special appeal to
the customary generosity of
the students. It is one of those
acts of constructive good will
which are needed in the reha-
bilitation of Japan as a friendly
and peaceful nation, The nation
which felt the power of our
atomic bombs in warfare will
“welcome such an unmistakable
manifestation of the Christian
power to overcome evil with
good. I daresay many of the
students who were engaged in
active warfare with the Japa-
nese will find a particular zest
in contributing to the spiritual
reconstruction of this,nation.
