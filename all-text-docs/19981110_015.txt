Steve Shurina is entering his sev-
enth season as a staff member of the
Davidson Wildcats men’s basketball
team, and fourth season as Associate
Head Coach. Shurina graduated from
St. John’s University in 1988 with a
degree in Criminal Justice, and earned a
master’s degree in physical education /
sports management from Brooklyn
College in 1992. Shurina captained his
St. John’s University basketball team
as a senior, and was a member of the.
Redmen squad that advanced to the
NCAA Final Four in 1985. Brooklyn
College served as the starting point for
Shurina’s coaching career. Between
his time at St. John’s University and
Brooklyn College, Shurina played pro-
fessional basketball in the United Staes
Basketball League, World Basketball
League and Continental Basketball °
Association.

On Thursday November Sth,
Davidonian Sports Staff writer Stephen
Cefalu spoke with Shurina about his
past, present and future.

DSS: Can you describe what it felt
like to go to the Final Four while you
were playing at St. John’s?

SHURINA: I went (to the Final Four)
when I was a freshman and I don’t think
leverreally appreciated it. Eventhough
I didn’t play a lot, it was a lot of fun. I
just assumed that we were going to go
back every year, that it was that easy.
Every year removed from that (first
season), we got further and further away.
We never came close to going back
again. I wish I would’ve appreciated it
more and taken it in more at that time. It
means an awful lot to me now.

DSS: What was it like to play with
Chris Mullin (at St. John’s)?

SHURINA: He was unbelievable, but _

as you began to play with him more and
more you took it for granted. My sopho-
more year, I had to play the same posi-
tion he played. I went back and watched
films of old plays from the year before.
I would watch, and being a year re-
moved from playing with him, I was
amazed at the things he was able to do.
He was obviously a great shooter and
had great hands, but the intangibles he
brought to the table were incredible. He
saw the floor like not too many people
I’ve ever seen. He had a work ethic
second to none.

DSS: How valuable was the experi-
ence of playing under Coach Lou

Carnesecca (at St. John’s)?

SHURINA: He gave me a great base

THE DAVIDSONIAN —

for my playing career as well as my
coaching career. He was the tradi-
tional, fundamental-focused coach, He
was a great personality and dealt re-
markably well with the media and his
players. I learned a lot from him in that
respect.

DSS: After four years playing under
Carnesecca at St. John’s, how much
ofa transition was it to play for George
Karl while you were with the Albany
Patroons in the CBA?

SHURINA: The order that it went in
terms of playing for coaches couldn’t

With Coach Shurina

have been any better. George was a
great innovator. I already hada great
base with Coach Carnesecca, and
George taught me a whole different
way to look at the game. Both George
and Coach Carnesecca were successful
in their own right, but completely dif-
ferent. Coach Karl taught me that some-
times right was left, up was down, and
big was small.

DSS: Can you recount your initial
entry into coaching at Brooklyn Col-
lege?

SHURINA: My first year (at Brooklyn
College) I was the fourth assistant on
the number 301 Division I team in the
country out of 301 teams. I was a
graduate assistant. I worked midnight
to eight as a doorman in Manhattan. I’d
leave at eight o’clock in the morning
and drive to Brooklyn, gotoclass, handle
my coaching responsibilities, attend
practice, go back to class in the evening,
then go back to.work. For six months,
I literally did not sleep. I'd be sitting at
the desk in the building where I worked,
just constantly knocking out. My sec-
ond year I became:a full-time paid as-
sistant and finished up my master’s
degree that year, (Ialso coached cross-
country), I wore all hats a coach could
wear. I did everything. I learned that if

_ SPORTS _

In focus with Associate Head Coach Steve Shurina

I could recruit for Brooklyn College, I
could recruit anywhere.

DSS: What brought you to Davidson?

SHURINA: At the end of my second
year at Brooklyn College, they did away
with the entire athletic program. As
they were dropping it, I was very fortu-
nate to get a call from Coach McKillop
asking me if I’d be interested in coming
down (to Davidson). He flew me down
to see the campus just as if I were a
prospective student, then offered me
the job.

MB,

DSS: Where did you first make the
acquaintance of Coach McKillop?

SHURINA: When I was at St. Francis
Prep, we used to scrimmage Long Is-
land Lutheran, where Coach McKillop
was coaching, and I got to know him
that way. Freshman year (at St. John’s),
my road roommate was Bill
Wennington, who played for Coach
McKillop at Long Island Lutheran. The
next three years: my roommate was
Marco Baldi, whoalso played for Coach
McKillop in high school. Through him,
I had contact with McKillop at various
summer camps and clinics.

DSS: What stands out most in your
mind about the teams you’ ve coached
at Davidson?

SHURINA: Their toughness, resil-
iency, versatility. It’s so challenging at
Davidson because of the academic stan-
dards. We cannot go out and say these
are the types of players we want to
recruit, in terms of all slashers or shoot-
ers, and just throw them into our sys-
tem. We have to recruit the best players
we can who are the best kids and then
mold our system around them. We’ve
definitely changed through the years.
Versatility has undoubtedly been the
greatest challenge for us.

DSS: How would you describe the
character of the 1998-99 Wildcat
team?

SHURINA: What’s interesting is that
they’re all players recruited by me, or
while I’ve been here. That’s exciting.
This year’s team has tremendous junior
and senior leadership. It has the poten-
tial to be as good as any of the ones
before it. How we fit the pieces to-
gether is gonna determine that.

Dss: What has it meant to you to
coach alongside Bob McKillop?

SHURINA: I’ve
learned an awful lot
from him. His organi-
zational skills are sec-
ond to none. His moti-
vation of the team is in-
credible. His prepara-
tion, whether it be for
practices, games or re-
cruiting, is the best I’ ve
ever seen. (Being
around him), you learn
how totreat people, how
to be a good coach, how
to really care about the
players. He cares about
his team and his coaches
just like they were apart
of his family.

DSS: Do you have a favorite moment
while coaching at Davidson?

SHURINA: My favorite moment was
last year when we won the (Southern
Conference) tournament. Before that
moment, I tried to play it over in my
mind a million times as to what exactly
I was going to do, how I was going to
react to what had happened. We’d been
so close so many times before. That
was our goal. It was a tremendous
feeling of accomplishment and, in some
ways, of relief. Ican remember that my
wife was the first one out after it all
ended, and I gave her a big hug. (There
was) so much joy and emotion. I stood
up on one of the chairs and looked up to
my parents, who’ ve come to every con-
ference tournament and been so influ-
ential, and just raised my hands up
together saying, “Yeah. This is finally
it.” :

DSS: What do you define as the pri-
mary duties of your position?

SHURINA: My two biggest duties are
overseeing all scouting, and overseeing
all_recruiting. I’ve been fortunate to
have a lot of input in what we do. Iam

very respectful and appreciative of
Coach McKillop for that.

DSS: How has recruiting changed
over the course of your seven years at
Davidson?

SHURINA: We can get in some doors
we couldn’t get in before because of
name recognition, but we haven’t
changed that much in what we’ re look-
ing for. We look for the best players we
can get. We judge hard work and tough-
ness to be talents, just as much as shoot-
ing, running and jumping. We put a lot
of emphasis on the intangibles. We
look for kids who are coachable an

want to get better.

DSS: How many hours do you put in
per week?

SHURINA: Coaching is a goal and
result-oriented process. You want to
get the best possible product out on the
court. You don’ t look at hours at all;
you just get the job done. Ifit takes 150
hours in a week, then you do that. If it
takes 60 hours, you do that. I love the
job.

DSS: What has being Associate Head
Coach of the Wildcats since 1995
meant to you?

SHURINA: I’ m extremely proud of
the title. It shows to my peers and
people around the country that, yeah,
I’ve done a pretty good job and Caoch
McKillop has rewarded me for that.

DSS: Over the years, you’ve had
oppotunities to move on, but you’ve
stayed. Is there any sort of unwritten
agreement that should an enticing
enough offer come along, you could
part ways with Davidson without
hard feelings?

SHURINA: If you were to have told
me when I came down here that I'd be
here for seven years, I would’ v e prob-
ably told you that you were crazy, be-
cause I didn’t know much about
Davidson. The reason I’ve been here
for seven years is because of the school,
the people in the community, and the
players I deal with daily. I absolutely
love it. I’ve had offers (such as from
Furman and Coastal Carolina) to move
on to positions which people in our
profession may define as a move up.
But I have a family here. This is the
ideal place to raise a family. I don’t
think people outside Davidson realize
what it’s-all about. I love it: :

Outside shot reigns supreme in Men’s exhibition

By Bro Krirr
Staff Writer

The men’s basketball season
opened last Thursday in exhibition with
a solid 86-78 victory over Team Vasda
in Belk Arena.

Led by shooting guard Davor
Halbauer’s 21 points and Landry
Kosmalski’s 19 points and 12 rebounds,
Coach Bob McKillop’s club displayed
its offensive balance in a challenging
exhibition match-up.

Vasda, a touring club composed of
former college players, entered the game
20 with victories over Coastal Carolina
and the Big South conference preseason
favorite UNC-Asheville.

“This is the best exhibition game
the team has played since I have been
here,” McKillop said. ‘Vasda played
hard and was very athletic. All five on
the court could shot and handled the
ball well and they all attacked the bas-

ket aggressively.”

But the Wildcats never seemed
over-matched and successfully con-
trolled the game’s tempo with timely
three-point baskets and second chance
points. In fact, Kosmalski scored the
opening points rebounding Ben Ebong’s
missed jumper and banking in the short
two foot shot.

Early in the half, Halbauer and Jeff
Bergman successfully fired from long
range answering the early season ques-
tions on the Cats’ outside effectiveness.
Halbauer proved his marksmanship on
a perfect first half, connecting on all
three shots beyond the arc.

McKillop. never
Halbauer’s ability to shoot.

“Davor played like we thought he
could,” McKillop said. “He hasn’t
missed a beat from last spring. He
proved himself as one of the better
players on the roster. His hard work in
the preseason showed itself tonight.”

After Dayidson extended the lead

to 28-13 on a lay-up by Kosmalski,
Vasda called a quick time-out to re-
group with nine minutes remaining in
the first half. Following the break,
Vasda slowly chiseled away at
Davidson’s lead over the next eight
minutes.

With one minute remaining in the ©

first half, Vasda took the lead on Fred
Watson’s dunk off a Davidson turn-
over. Ending the first half, Ben Ebong
made two free throws and the Wildcats
entered the locker room tied at 40 all.

Any questions on Ali Ton’s health
and agility were answered after the in-
termission as he dished out eight assists
over nine second half minutes. Despite
the fantastic open court passes for easy
lay-ups, Ton never shot the ball.

But in Thursday night’ s game Ton
did more than anyone could anticipate
after his threatening foot injury.

“Ali had 18 minutes coming off
surgery,” McKillop said. “He played
very aggressively and choose not to

shoot. We were looking to get him
game experience, trying to get him up
to basketball speed.”

After Vasda took a 69-68 lead with
seven minutes left in the game, Davidson
rattled off eight straight points on three
point baskets by Bergman and

Kosmalski, and a lay-up by Emeka

Erege.

All three baskets resulted from a
Ton assist.

Vasda could never close this mar-
gin as Davidson seemed relaxed and
showed patience in their offensive
scheme. Over the last four minutes,
Davidson continued to pass to the open
man and knocked down their outside
jumpers. oe

extreme depth at all five positions,”
McKillop said. “Five guys made three-
pointers and eight took at least one.”

The outside shot spread the de-
fense, allowing Kosmalski and com-

“The game gave our fans a glimpse

pany to establish position down low
and control the boards. The Cats’ 11
offensive rebounds led to 18 second
chance points.

“We have nine to ten players who
can shoot from the outside,” McKillop
said. “This will be valuable to the
effectiveness of our interior game.”
