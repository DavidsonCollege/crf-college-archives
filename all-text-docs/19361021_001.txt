NINE STUDENTS ARE
RECIPIENTS OF BIDS
TO PHI BETA KAPPA

Straw Vote Returns

Are To Be Withheld

Because of the fact that many
of the faculty have not turned
in their votes in the canvass of
the presidential election, and be-
cause two speakers will address
the students and friends of Dav-
idson, the results of the straw
vote are being withheld until
next week.

At this time the returns from
colleges all over the United:
States will also be published and
a comparison will be made with

the results on the Davidson
campus.
Plans are being made for

prominent Demoeratic and Re-
publican speakers to address the
students here next week. Feeling
is running high in the local stu-
dent body and it is hoped that no
serious conflicts will result.
