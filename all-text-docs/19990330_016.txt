Davidson baseball took a mid-season break
from game play last week, attempting to regroup
and focus on a late season run for the coveted
Southern Conference tournament bid.

The five-day hiatus proved therapeutic as

Davidson ended their eight game winless streak
with an 11-8 come-from-behind victory over
Western Carolina University (17-9, 6-1). '
The Catamounts entered the weekend undefeated
and in sole possession of first place in conference.
The three game series marked the Wildcat’s third
consecutive weekend against the conference’s
current standings leader.

The Wildcats (4-23-1, 3-12) pounded out 12
hits and took advantage of seven base on balls for
the three run victory. In the contest, Davidson
twice equaled their highest run output of the sea-
son in a single inning (five).

In the Wildcat’s five-run third inning, Ben
Brown, Stuart Sloan, and Tim Frend all hit home
runs. Davidson has notachieved this feat since the
great career of Rick Bender. On April 12, 1992,
Bender, former assistant coach Brett Boretti, and
Paul Brannan all hit home runs, leading the Wild-

cats to a 7-6 victory in 10 innings.

Brown’s blast to deep left center ended his
464 at-bat homerless drought, which lasted nearly
two years. Sloan’s power surge was not finished.
The score was tied eight all in the seventh inning.
With two outs and two strikes against him, the
determined Sloan successfully connected on a
bases loaded double scoring Brown and pinch
runner Steven Aldrich.

His hit proved to be the game winner as

pitcher Wes Self shut down the Catamount hitters.

in the seventh inning. “Stu showed a lot of poise
on the game winning hit,” said Co-captain Kurt
Davis. Self (3-4) pitched seven innings for his
forth complete game of the season. He currently
leads the Wildcat staff in ERA (6.17), wins (three),
complete games (four), innings pitched (46.2),
and strikeouts (28).

“We showed a lot of fight,” said Davis. “We
have had some strong come backs, but we didn’t
come through and finish the job. This shows we
might get over the hill we have been climbing all
season and continue playing successfully.”

Western Carolina won the other two games
of the series, 9-3 and 15-7, however the losses
have not discouraged the Wildcats. Davis recog-

nizes what must be accomplished in the upcoming
weeks to earn a trip to the tournament in Charles-
ton.

“As we approach next weekend with College
of Charleston, we need to do a better job of
manufacturing runs, making defensive stops, and
controlling the opponents’ running game.”

Davidson will play at UNC-Chapel Hill on
Wednesday. The Tar Heels are currently ranked
second in the nation.

Nothing restores a team’s confidence after
four consecutive losses like a couple of key con-
ference victories.

Against Appalachian St., the ‘Cats came
within one doubles matches of a shutout as all six
singles players and two of the three doubles teams
claimed victories.

“It was our first sweep of singles all season,”
said senior #1 seed Dana Casner, “The win helped
bring us into the weekend. We played a really
solid match and everyone had a good day. Overall,
it was a solid conference win.”

The strength of the Appalachian St. lineup
was in the top three positions, as Davidson’s
seniors, # 1 Casner, #2: Amber Bradford, and #3
Claire Cheatwood were all pushed to three sets.

Casner dropped her first set 6-3 but came
back to claim the next two 6-4 and 6-1. Bradford
and Cheatwood lost their first sets by identical 6-
1 margins, but they both stormed back to win their
matches in three sets.

In the bottom half of the singles lineup, the
‘Cats had no trouble with the Appalachian St.
players, as freshmen Forbes Thompson and Eliza-
beth Moreno won their fourth and fifth seeded
matches by identi-

cal 6-0, 6-1 score’.
