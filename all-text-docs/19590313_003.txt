All That

C ) i By JIM HAMILTON

Periodically during the year and especially in the
last two weeks the IMAC (Intramural Athletic Council)
has received criticism from various sources on campus.
The most recent attack came as a result of their ruling
on the eligibility of a participant in the Interfraternity
track meet last week. This furor was heightened since
the individual under question was the main factor in
deciding the outcome of the meet.

The chief criticism directed at the Council is
that the interfraternity athletic program lacks a codi-
fied set of regulations to govern the various sports.
The rules used are vague, say the critics, and are full
of loopholes and ambiguities that allow situations |
such as the one last week to arise.

The present set of regulations do seem inade-
quate, but this is to be expected. The IMAC took over.
the reins of the sports program only last year and since!
then has been working with the old rules on a trial basis’
to see what works and what doesn’t.

Westy Captures Third Crown]
In Conference Tournament,

Last weekend, at the Southern Conference Wrestling Tournament in Charles-
“Westy” Westervelt captured his third conference title and the Davidson

ton, S. C.,
squad took fourth place in

The team championship was
won by West Virginia, who up-
set favored V.P.L, the runner-
up. V.M.I. finished third, with
Davidson fourth and the Cita-
del fifth. Of the five Davidson
wrestlers who participated,
four placed in the meet. Be-
sides Westervelt, who won the
177 lb. class, were Milton Gee,
runner-up at 147 Ibs., Cliff
Thompson, 4th place, and Alec
‘Porter, 4th place.

GEE HURT

Gee, who injured his knee on
the way to victory*in his semi-
final match Friday night. was

forced to default in the finals

Problems on eligibility and the like would have been
almost impossible to avoid.

The council, with a year’s experience under its
belt, is now ready to propose a codified set of regula-
tions that several of its members feel will greatly re-
duce the now-existing loopholes. President Ralph Wilson
and secretary George Ramsey have prepared a new set
of rules that will be presented to the council in several
weeks, and which, if passed by thé council, will subse-
quently be sent on to the fraternities for ratification.

Perhaps some criticism is due, but it seems to me

“When the meet was over, the V. M. I. coach (his

team won) walked up to me and said, ‘Your boys might' -.

“ "Dark horses, heck,’ I said. ‘We'll be contend-
ers.’ And with 18 boys instead of nine (the number we
took to the conference), we will be.”

Coach Parker was not so lucky with injuries.

Redhead Milton Gee, a solid favorite to win his
finals match in the 147 pound class, woke up Saturday
morning with a sore leg and ad to be carried down to
the training room. The whirlpool did no good, and Gee

Said Milt, “I never saw any bunch of guys so inter-

against the fellow from West Virginia, it would have
meant that V. P. I. won the tournament.”

It’s nice to find altruistic sentiments among com-

McKee stated that it was too
early to post anything but a
tentative lineup, but listed
Semi Mintz, Tom McCutchan
and John Poindexter as his top
three men, although he men-
tioned that Finley Lee was at
present looking good enough
to play as high as number two.
Harry Broome is working hard

Baseballers Initiate
Season Next Week

Davidson College formally
opened practice for the 1959

der the auspices of Coach Tom
Stevens.

Captain and catcher Harold
Reagan had been directing in-
formal workouts for pitchers
for almost a month prior to
this. Sophomore Jim Smith has
been throwing well in practice.
Coach Stevens noted this and
also pointed out that he has
three regular starters return-
ing this year: Dee Green, Dee
Lide, and Pat Henderson.

In the infield Don Killian,
shortstop; Harold Bynum, 2nd
base; and Jerry Cole, 1st base,
have been outstanding. Hurry

fielder, but there is a definite
lack of den’h in this position as
is po’nted out by Stevens.
