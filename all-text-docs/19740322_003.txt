Morgan Rebukes Duke Power Rates

By ANDY LAMAS
Senior News Editor

State Attorney General
Robert Morgan, Democratic
candidate for the U.S. Senate,
spoke here Monday on a wide
range of domestic issues.

Morgan’s most con-
troversial statement con-
cerned his opposition to Duke
Power's proposed 17 percent
rate increase.

“I am opposed to the rate
hike. Also, I do not think it’s
proper for a power company

to advertise its merits during
the course of a hearing before
the Public Utilities Com-
mission,’’ commented
Morgan.

The Attorney General also
showed concern about Duke
Power’s refusal to debate
representatives of the North
Carolina Public Interest

Research Group (NC PIRG)
on the Davidson campus.

He expressed support for
PIRG’s prescription drug
legislation which is now before
the state legislature.

“I think it would be helpful if
prescription drug prices were
posted in all pharmacies. The
current price discrepancies
are a tremendous burden on
the poor and aged,’’ remarked
Morgan.

The senatorial candidate
also criticized President
Nixon's handling of the
nation’s inflation problem.

“Four years ago President
Nixon introduced the first $200
billion budget in the nation’s
history and now the first $300

billion budget. It is amazing to
think that he campaigned on a
platform of a_ balanced

LET ME SAY THIS ABOUT THAT

Monday to talk with students and faculty.

budget,’’ declared Morgan.

“I’m tor a strong defense,
but I know the Defense Denar-
tment could be run more ef-
ficiently and less ex-
pensively,’’ he argued.

“One of the problems con-
cerning defense expenditures
involves the method of defense
contracting. I favor a plan of
competitive bidding for all
defense contracts.”

Morgan also believes that
reducing the number of
federal employees and depen-
ding more on military reser-
ves and the National Guard
can help to cut inflation.

He avoided taking firm
positions on the possibility of
President Nixon’s’ im-
peachment, health care, and
busing.

“I think the House must
move much more ex-
peditiously in its  im-
peachment proceedings, but I
do not feel it would be proper
for me to comment on how I
would vote on the im-
peachment matter’ con-
sidering my future position as
a possible juror in the
Senate,’ commented Morgan.

Complaining about the high
cost of medical care but of-
fering no health care plan of
his own, Morgan attacked
several current proposals.

‘“‘Nixon’s plan is too ex-
pensive; Senator Kennedy's
places too much burden on the
taxpayer; and, I am doubtful
about the AMA proposal,”
stated Morgan.

When asked what type of
national health care plan he
would support, Morgan said,
‘‘Thave no real ideas on it."’

Candidate Morgan posited
that every child ought to have
the right to go to the school in
his/her neighborhood but that
busing is a necessary evil until
school conditions in some
areas of the nation are im-
proved.

As Attorney General,
Morgan claimed that he spon-
sored much of Lee Bounds’s
(the former N.C. Corrections
chief) innovative prison re-

tics could be driven away from

“Generally I am opposed to
amnesty for men who were in-
volved in the Vietnam War,”
stated Morgan.

remarking that each amnesty

judiciary
Morgan stated that he has

based his campaign on his
past performance in govern-
ment. He said that his main
areas of work are consumer

affairs and law enforcement.

“I instituted a progam of
consumer advocacy in the At-
torney General’s office and
have improved and increased
the state’s law enforcement
agencies,’’ commented
Morgan.

Morgan plans to finance his
campaign for the Democratic
nomination on a budget of
$400,000.

He claimed that his op-
ponent, Henry Hall Wilson,
has violated the state’s cam-
paign spending laws.

FIND OUT IF YOUR FAMILY IS

Food stamps are for people who support a
big family on a small income. Or for
elderly people who earn little and live on
Social Security. Or for anybody with a
small income who is eligible. Depending
on your income, the government sells you
food stamps at a big discount or gives
them to you free.

AS GOOD AS MONEY.

Food stamps are like money. You use
them to buy food as if they were cash.
They stretch your food dollars and let you
feed your family better. With food stamps
you can get twice as much food for your
family without spending any more
money. 1%

GROCERY STORES

Almost all food stores take food stamps
for food purchases. It’s a good deal for
the store because it increases total
business when you use food stamps to buy
extra food.

YOU HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT TO
FOOD STAMPS

Your legal right to food stamps is protec-
ted by Federal Law. In addition, you have
a legal right to get food stamps as soon as
| you move to a new area. An you have a
