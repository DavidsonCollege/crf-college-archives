Reading and Game Rooms Have
Been Overhauled

Continuing its program of remodeling,
the Y. M. C. A. Board of Control, at a
meeting held Monday night, September
23, decided to repaint and refurnish the
Social Center. The plans of the Board
include sandpapering, varnishing, wax-
ing, and polishing the floors, painting the
woodwork a cream color instead of the
dingy brown that it is now, putting in
new curtains, and getting as much new
furniture as they can.

Albert McClure, General Secretary of
the Y. M. C. A. for the second year,
in discussing the work, said, “he Sociai
Center should serve not only as a place
fore receptions and gatherings of the
boys but laso as a sort of headquarters
for. any of the families and friends of
the students who may be visiting here.
At present it is entirely inadequate for
that.”

The “Y” itself has undergone quite
a change in the past month. The reading
room has been repapered, a new _ all-
wave radio and a table lamp have been
installed, and new curtains are planned.
In the game room, the pool table has
been re-conditioned, the improvements
totaling around fifty dollars. A ping-
pong tournament is to be held sometime
between Thanksgiving and Christmas,
though the date has not been definitely
set.

Directory" Reveals
Odd Nomenclature

Freshmen Are First and Last In
List of Names

By O. F. F. ANON

It’s an interesting list of names we
have in the Student Directory for this
year. The line-up is led off by two frosh,
Abbott and Abell. The same class also
has the honor of being last in the school
with a Young, and Yow. Yow almost, has
the shortest name in College, but we no-
tice other three-letter names: Cox, Eve,
Gaw, Orr, and Poe. There’s a Miss
Adams, too, if you're interested, Mr.
Eve.

Both Sophs and Frosh have continu-
ous of sibilant sounds in
their Squires, Stair, Steele, Steere, and
Stocks, Storey, Stowe, Street combina-
tions. The Frosh again take honours for
being the most patriotic class (or
Alma Matriotic the right word?) with
two Davidsons, this year. The Seniors of
course, have one, but that’s nothing new.

Speaking of those short names has
reminded me that Feuchtenberger still
has the longest name on the hill, with
Bill Kieswetter running second.

Really surprising is that; instead of
Smith-leading-the roll with the largest
number of names, Johnston is ahead with
eight. After Johnston are the Thomp-
sons and Browns, each clan with seven
members. The Smiths tie for third place
with the Moore and Clark tribes, each
having six collegians in their numbers.
Joneses, usually considered to rank next
to Smiths, are ‘way down the list with
only two.

Friend Quick must feel lonely, with no
other Q's to keep him company, but at
least he can himself with the
thought that he has an outstandfng place
in the eyes of his school-mates. We no-
tice he lives in the Eagle’s nest, and if
you will pardon us, Mr. Quick for our
reversion to the lowest form of humor,
we'd like to suggest that you've got to
be Quick to live in an Eagle’s nest! Bill
is almost in the same class as the Wiss
X’s, and Z's, on this list. If he were
not there, he would be—n'est-ce pas?

If names mean anything to a person's
destiny, as some people think, we would
like to suggest that the Arrowsmiths,
and the Archers would get along well
together; but the combination would
hardly be complete without an Arm-
strong and a Hand (to help Hunt). With
all those, the Hunter ought to be Abell
to Kellam, but here’s hoping he Winn-s,
and not the Bull. I also think that we
ought to put Goodrum in a Glass and
serve it to the King, for that’s the Best
we've got, and it ought to be good enough
for any Mann. Of Course, a Goodman
doesn’t drink or Smoak.

“Dade your Furness Smoak?” “Yow-
sir, and it Burns Dimm.”

“Chase yourself, Young Mann!”

Pfohl Plans Very Busy Year For

Band, Salon Orchestra, and
Glee Club

The Davidson Music Department, un-
der the direction of Prof. Jamés P¥Sh1,
with two additions to its faculty, has be-
gun work on what promises to be one of
the most successful years in its history.

Calls have been made for the Glee
Club, the Little Symphony Orchestra,
the Symphonic Band, the R.O.T.C. Band,
the Football, and the Second or Junior
Band, a new musical organization this
year. These groups have met, organized,
and begun their work. All these organiza-
tions have promise of a most successful
year, for almost all of last year's per-

sonnel has returned and some very tal-
ented freshmen have reported. A very
busy year is planned for these organi-
zations with the regular weekly pro-
grams, the vesper and church services,
home concerts, and several tours.

Two additions have been made to the
music department faculty this year. Mr.
Franklin Riker, of Statesville, will come
here two days each week to teach voice,
speech, and song. Mr. Riker is a very
talented musician and an excellent in-
structor. Mr. A. Moreland Cunningham.
a last year’s graduate from Davidson,
has returned this fall for graduate study
and to assist in the music department.
He will assist in the band work, having
charge of drilling the Football Band and

Despite the fact that the requirements
for those taking military drill have been
made much more lenient this year than
previously, and despite the fact that this
fact was made known prior to registra-

Of the number in classes required to
take military training, only 36 have been

It is reported, however, that at least a
small percentage of the remarkable class
of '39 has learned the difference between
the right and the left (though many are
still hazy on what is right and what is
wrong), and the “Why ?”
giving way to reasonable
query, “How?”

Rifles were issued to the neophytes at
the regular drill last Monday,
