CATALOGUE OF DAVIDSON
GRADUATES TO BE ae

Doctor Lingle Edits Revision. All,
Faculties and Student Bodies |
in History to be Listed |

In 1891 there was issued from the press |
a volume known as The Semi-Centennial |
Catalogue of Davidson College, edited)
by such distinguished alumni as W. A.|
Withers, ’83, now vice-president of North |
Carolina State College of Agriculture and |
Engineering; WW. W. Moore, '78, president
of Union Theological Seinthary: Henry
Louis Smith, ’81, president of Washington |
and ee University; J. H. Hill, °54, and)
W. S. Lacy, '59, both now deceased. This |
aia prepared by this distinguished
committee of alumni is the only volume
of its kind ever published. It contains a
list of all the trustees of Davidson Col-|
lege, beginning in 1836. A brief sketch
of the life of each man who has been on}!
the faculty is shown. A-short sketch of
all graduates is given, and those who |
matriculated but did not graduate are
mentioned, Those having received ad-|
vanced and honorary degrees are men-
tioned. The summary gives the class |
membership and annual attendance, the}
ages at graduation, occupations follow- |
ed, geographical distribution according |
to states, etc. At the end there is an al-|
phabetical list of all students ever at-
tending Davidson College.

This catalogue is now being revised
and brought up to date. Prof, T. W.}
Lingle is acting as editor and is obtain-
ing aid from various sources. This new!
catalogue ‘will probably come from the|
press sometime in December. It is to
contain a very brief account of the}
§.600 students who have studied at David- |
son, of all the faculties since 1837, a list |
of all trustees, and various summaries |
and tabulations which will be of interest. |
This volume will necessarily be com-|
paratively larger than the former one,!
there being 5,600 students to record,
whereas in the former one there were!
only 1,804 students recorded.

R. O. T. C. ORGANIZATION FOR |
YEAR COMPLETED

C. |

There are 352 men in the R. O. T.

this year. Two hundred and twenty |
Fresh, 180 Sophomores, 19 Juniors, and |
five Seniors. For these men, Capt. |

Hearn has a good many places, which are |
not yet ready for announcement. Among |
other things, however, it is intended to
hold squad and platoon. competitions
this fall.

In the past two years, Companies B
and C have won first place, while Com- |
pany D has come second on two occa-
sions. Company A has excelled in close-
order drill.

Capt. Hearn would caution all "gn,
new and old in the matter of saluting
the flags at all times. In this connection
it is worthy of note, that 15 per cent of
a man’s grade in R. O. T. C. depends up-
on his conduct record,

| EFFICIENT SYSTEM INSTALL-|
ED AT LIBRARY

ot orem |

This vear an entirely new system of '
keeping records of books taken out from!
| the library has been installed. Hereto-
fore when a student obtained a book he |
was given a page in a ledger in which |
the name of the book and necessary data |
concerning it was written down. This
system necessitated a great deal of work |
at the end of the year on the part of
the librarian, and it was very inefficient, |
there being no way to tell how many!
books had been lost until the final check- |
ing-up at the end of the year. |
However, the systein inaugurated this |

from a great deal of work and will enable
her to accurately check up each day on
every book that is overdue. When a
student obtains a book it takes a little
more of his time, but it is believed that |
he will not mind this when he considers
how much he is aiding the library—

|; sometmes himself, when he might for-
|} get to return a book and will find a sum

charged against him. |

Each student fills out a card for each |
book taken out. On the card is his
name, date, name of the book, its author
and the number. In the back of the,

| book he is taking out is a form on which
| is stamped the date the book is to be re-

turned, and this date is also recorded |
on his card, which is then indexed on
the date of expiration. At the end of
this time a check-up is easily obtained.

RAIN OF TERROR IN EAST AND
WEST DORMS

For the past several days a peculiar
and unique condition has existed in the
new East and West dormitories. They
have at intervals gushed forth streams
of water on the unwary visitor.

3ut these two unkind buildings even
emit fountains and showers of “aqua”
not only on visitors but on occupants of
the buildings themselves. Indeed, one
must keep a watchful eye toward the up-
per windows; and must have a good
pair of pedal extremities.

The Guard Dragon of this organiza-
tion is one of the tribe of McKinnon,
otherwise known as “Buffalo.” He
directs his cohorts on every unwary
traveler, so that no one is able to escape
his baptism of water. Usually, he con-
tents himself with directing his cohorts;
but when an especially choice victim

|approaches; he takes active part to the

temporary detriment of the victim,

In West Dorm, another devotee of
i this peculiar art, holds hourly sacrifice
to the same god. He hails from the

tribe of McCombs, but his name is “Red,”

because of his flaming thatch. This
young man often vies with the said
“Buffalo,” to see which can carry off

prime honors in the ever-drenching con-
test. The battle shifts as the moments,
ene time sturdy “Red” will claim more
victims, while in the next instant
“Avoirduois” Buffalo will have more
scalps dangling from his belt.

JOSEPH HENRY
1797-1878

Born at Albany, N. Y., where
he became teacher of mathe-
matics and physics in Albany
Academy. Leading American
physicist of his time. First
director of the Smithsonian
Institution.

The work that was begun
by pioneers like Joseph
Henry is being carried on
by the scientists in the Re-
search Laboratories of the
General Electric Company.

ing for fundamental prin-
ciples in order that electric-
ity may be of greater
service to mankind.

‘When Henry |
rang the bell

If any bell was ever heard around the
world, Joseph Henry rang it in his

famous experiment

at the Albany

Academy. The amazing development
of the electrical industry traces back

to this schoolmaster’s

coil of insulated

wire and his electro-magnet that lifted

a ton of iron.

Four years later when Morse used
Henry’s electro-magnet to invent the
telegraph, Henry congratulated him
warmly and unselfishly.

The principle of Henry’s coil of wire is
utilized by the General Electric Com-

pany in motors and

generators that
