Educational Stagnation

The current controversy concerning required
physical education has uncovered a much more per-
vasive problem at Davidson than that of compulsory
P. E. It involves not only the school’s curriculum
policy, but also the traditional Davidson attitude to-
wards education.

Despite the high reputation that Davidson has
maintained as an educational. institution, it seems
that the primary concern here has historically been
one of production, not education. The college has
dedicated itself to producing college graduates rather
than to educating human beings.

Education has been understood as that which is
needed to earn a diploma: The student has been con-
sidered ‘“‘educated” when he has completed the school’s
requirements for graduation. All too often at David-
son, the quality of the college product has been judg-
ed by his ability to adapt to certain meaningless class-
room experiences rather than by his willingness to
learn.

Such an educational philosophy still permeates
Davidson attitudes. It is evident in the administration
mentality, as C. David Cornell, vice-president of fin-
ance and development, demonstrated in a recent in-
terview when he stated that, to go coed, Davidson
must, improve such departments as music, art, and
sociology. The administration apparently has not real-
ized that the male students already at Davidson have
just as great a need for improvement in such areas
of study as any future female students.

The faculty is just as guilty of maintaining such
an attitude towards education as the administration.
Many of Davidson’s finest professors have allowed
themselves to become caught in a web of mediocrity
and boredom, not because of lack of ability or incen-
tive, but because they have not exerted the energy
which would allow them to break free of the tradition-
al academic syndrome at Davidson. It is ‘indeed un-
fortunate that such qualified teachers should become
c0-aorly acclimated to the pervading attitudes of the
college.

Most of the blame for the Davidson educational
philosophy, however, lies with the student body. It
is rare that a student interested«in genuine intellectual
activity'and pursuit survives four years of Davidson
without allowing himself to become apathetic and dis-
enchanted with learning. Graduation becomes the goal,
not education, grades become the concern, not know-
ledge. The students have allowed themselves to he-
come emasculated production units.

However, things. are beginning to look up. Re-

cent developments have given indications that, un-
der the evergrowing influence’ of Vice-president of
Academic Affairs John M. Bevan, education at David-
son is progressing very rapidly. The Junior Year
Abroad program is slated to be expanded and improv-
ed in the next few years. The Honors College, despite
its false start, has a great deal of potential, as does
the Eight-College Exchange program. Finally, there
is the Extended Studies program, probably the most
promising and exciting of educational’ opportunities
at Davidson. .

The most amazing and effective development,
however, has been the recent change in the attitude
of a number of students. Admittedly they are -still in
the minority in their efforts for progressive and mean-
ingful education, but they are an increasingly vocal
and influential minority. All of which gees to show
that the traditional Davidson attitude toward educa-
tion is improving.

This leads us back to the question
physical education.”Such a notion, it’seems to us,
smacks of the old attitudes and archaic prep school
concepts of “a sound mind in a sound body.” and does

nothing to promote new programs in education. There- . -

fore, we feel that in keeping with the present concern

with educational reform and in recognition of a new

‘understanding of education that is growing at-David-
son, compulsory P. E. should be “abolished.

College Church To Serve

Role In Brave New World

The Davidson College
Presbyterian Church build-
ing is ugly. It is also not
used much. The building is
massive, and because of its
size and. the fact that it was
the pet project of College
President John Cunningham,

it has been called ‘The
Cathedral of St. John the
Divine.”’

The structure is composed
of a large sanctuary (which
was supposed to seat all
1,000 students, but actually
only seats 800 because of an
architectural mistake), a
rarely used chapel, and a
large Sunday school build-
ing.

The Sunday school building
houses 12 classrooms, 4 of-
fices, 2 lounges, 7 bath
rooms, 1. library, 2 kitchens,
and a large dining room
with a stage.

‘Also located in the base-
ment is a fallout shelter
which I found locked upon

‘ my inspection, Perhaps that

- byterians

shelter is reserved for the
three first families of David-
son in case of attack: the
Sam _ Spencers, the Shaw
Smiths, and the Ed Whites.

Three years ago, Sam
Spencer signed a _ contract
which supposedly authorized
a total of $214,000 worth of
redecorating for the church.
The college must pay this
upkeep ‘because the Pres-
are’ using the
building for free’ since the
building actually belongs .to
the College.

For this amount, the Col-
lege repaired the roof and
ceiling, painted the interior,
dusted the pews, rebuilt the
organ, installed a long gold
carpet, and bought expen:
sive parquet material for
the chancel floor. (The par-
quet wood, incidentally,
does not match its own de-
sign in some places.)

The College church was
designed for a worshipping
community, which Davidson
now is not. It is quite distres-
sing to go to a service ‘in
that buliding now and to see
the place so empty. Main-
tenance is not worth tHe bf-
fort, and the College is wast-
ing badly needed space.

Therefore, I suggest the
following: .

1. Take out the church
pews, and turn the main
sanctuary into a_ free-form
theatre with moveable
stages and seats. This can
be used for plays (since
Hodson Hall is so inade-
quate), concerts, and other
creative ventures.

2. Turn the chapel into an
art gallery.

3. Use the large Sunday
school - building for David-
son’s first commune. Kitchen
facilities are already there,
and living quarters could be
easily provided.

(Make sure that this com-
mune is co-ed, and admit
large number of girls to the
College immediately.

4. Utilize the steeple as. an
-FM antenna for WDAV-FM.

(My critics will say that
we cannot do this because of
our tradition and history, be.

cause this building is es-'
sential to ‘‘the life of the
College,”” and because valu-
able financial support from
the Presbyterian Church
will be cut: off.

This sounds like an institu-
tionalized castration com-
plex..

(My own perceptions: tell
me that wherever truth is,
it is obviously not where the
members of this church look
for it. 5!

I know, too, that some
members of that hearty band
of Scotch Presbyterians who,
with compulsion, attend each
Sunday service at the church,
will suffer some deprivation
anxiety as their services (on
which their entire life de-
pends) are yanked from be-
neath them.

For them, I wffer. one or
more of the following sugges-
tions: wie

1. Stay home Sundays ‘at .
eleven and sleep like the .

rest of the world does,

2. Go. out into the real
world and relate to people
on meaningful levels like Je-
sus reportedly did. Specifical-
ly, get to know some stu-
dents and some of the very
poor people who live in this
community.

3. Donate your Sunday
clothes to your favorite char-
ity, or, if -you happen to
know people who need them
(which you probably don’t),

LETTERS

give the clothes to them per-
Sonally. ,

4. If the malady persists
and you can't get away from
a liturgical service, convert
to the Episcopalian religion,
join the ‘'Tinkertoy Cathe-
dral’’ (St. Alban’s), and at-
tend their services, which
are much more aesthetically
pleasing.

Or join churches near here
which are attended by blacks
and poor people who never
could afford the expensive
dress necessary to go to the
D.C.P.C.

Now I know that the idea
of using Davidson's resour-
ces to their best advantage
has never crossed the minds
of my favorite people: Sam

Spencer, Jack Bevan, Will
Terry, Dick Burts, Scott
Woodmansee, and Shaw
Smith.

But this is 4 serious. sug-
gestion, and the development
of a creative arts center and
commune (in addition to a
profitable eskimo pie factory)
or perhaps a good commun-
ity center for this entire
area,. . . for both blacks
and, whites « . . is certainly
worth considering. .

The use of this building
might bring co-education a
little closer, in spite of Mr.
Cornell’s inane comments in
last week’s THE DAVIDSON-
IAN about the subject.

Official Explains

Voting Procedure

To the Editors:

This is to clarify some
confusion as to the determin-
ation that a 2/3 vote of the
entire student body would
have been required to over-
turn the Senate’s invitation
to Rennie Davis.

This decision was not ar-
bitarily made nor intention
ally made so ag to render
the chances of reversing the
Senate’s action impossible.

The Constitution and By-
Laws Committee made its
interpertation of the ‘rele-
vant section of the SGA
Constitution in accordance
with .past precedent (last
year’s open dorm referen-
dum) and in keeping -with
the actual wording of the
Constitution, which does. re-
quire a 2/3 vote of the SGA.

That this requirement ef-
fectively stifles referenda,
as some have charged, is not
true; and the open dorm re-
ferendum passed overwhelm-
ingly despite the 2/3 require-
ment.

That it may need modifi-
cation is another matter.
The Constitution . and By-
Laws Committee is current-
ly considering revisions of
.our written _ operating pro-
cedure, and questions such
as these will certainly be
considered.

To the Editors:

’ Surely there is no one per-
son at this school who has
not recently become aware
of the latest campus vogue—
droping out for a term.

I write of course regard-
ing these ROTC students
who, becatise of low priority
draft numbers, feel as if they
may drop out of school for
one term in order to avoid
fulfilling their contract with
the, Army.

Thus they forfei t their
chance to serve their coun-
try in the way only (and in
the only way) a real pa-
triotic American should.

What has gone wrong?
Will no one stand up for
America? You dare desert
when your country needs
you ‘most? This country was
built on blood, and Ameri-
can blood shall continue to
be split-in order to pay for
and to preserve the precious
emancipation of their. plan-
et.

Therefore I urge these de-
serters and contractbreak-
ers (now numbering about
eight) to return and face up
‘o their moral duty as men.
And just maybe then all will
be well with the world!
