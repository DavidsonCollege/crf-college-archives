Sam Lowe Convicted Mark Bills
of Serious Offenses

Before ROTC Court

Court Martial Dismisses Lowe
From Services For Attack
On Officer

Lieut. Sam Lowe was found
guilty on two charges in a
mock court_martial on Mon-
day night, and as punishment
he will be dismissed from ser-
vice and will be confined with
two years hard labor.

He was guilty of the charges of
wilfully, disobeying the order of a
superior officer, Licut. H. H. Mc-
Fadyen, that he conduct himself in
a more military manner; al$o he
was guilty of striking, McFadyen on
the shin with his foot.

Other Charges Cleared

There were two other charges
brought against Lowe, but counsel
for the defense succeeded in prov-
ing him not guilty in these. They
were, mainly, that Lowe threatened
McFadyen with bodily hurt, and
that he attempted to draw his sabre
on him.

The prosecution was composed of
Henry Harkey, Bruce Parcell, and
Hector McGeachy. The defense
that ably defended the accused
consisted of Jim Wilson, Bill Man-
son, Leonard Fort, and Torrey Mc-
Lean. The witnesses that appeared
before the court were H. H. Me-;
Fadyen,_R. M. King, A, L. Skin-
ner, Elmore Holt, W. W. Lowrance,
Col. John Rhett. and Maj. C. M.
Steele. The court that convicted
Lowe was as follows: Euclid, Fant,
Git Palmer, Rufus Wallace, Springs
Pharr, Julian Helms, and ‘Bob
Miciling. The reporter was Tom!
Danicls; the president of the court
was Teeny Laffétty; and the law
member was Springs Pharr.

The offense_was supposedly com-
mitted on Nov. 29, and the prose-
cution proved that McFadyen-_had
corrected Lowe three times before
the offénse. However, a statement
from Mrs. Johnson, the school
nurse, stated that a cold ‘prevented

On Battle Eve

Spirit Runs High as Old Rivals
Prepare For Tilt

Spirit is running high in the halls
of Watts and Georgia Dormitories.

fonder why? Perhaps the annual
football classic that is to take place
on Richardson Field Thursday be-
tween the two dormitories is the
cause.

The Watts Tea Hounds, after los-
ing a close battle to the Georgia
Rats last year, are determined to
come_out on top of this yearly af-
fair. On the other hand the Rats
claim to have the best team in re-
cent years, including an “A»No. 1”
cheering section, led by the ever-
noisy Pete Marchant, who assumed
the duties left by the one and only
“Reddy” Sugg.

No pre-game antics will take
place this year as has been the cus-
tom in the past. Both sides have
decided that this procedure would
keep their players from getting the
desired rest that they need before
the- game. In past years, it was
nothing unusual to see members of
the two dormitories gather on the
night before the classic to stage a
“water fight,” or a “window burst-
ing” campaign. The administration,
however, has agreed to furnish uni-
forms for the “boys” this year if
the pranks are cut out.

Rats Plan Attack

Three great coaches have been
secured by the Rats to put their
boys through their paces. “Maes-
tra” King, “Twinkletoes” Lafferty,
and “Slug” Matthis have signed
coaching contracts, and with such
material_as Faison, Reid, Wilson,
Rader, Harrison, Pittman, Kiese-
wetter, Durham, the Ganiers, Bar-
tow and Brown, they promise to
pound out a winning combination.

The Tea Hounds were not to be
outdone and have selected such
stalwarts as “Iron Man” Dennis,
Fred Stair, and Bob Abell to round
out their abundance of material.

Begin Next Week

The first. stroke of the bell at
the lunch hour on Friday, Dec.
17, will mark the beginning of
thé Christmas vacation at Dav-
idson College. Until it rings
again at 8:25 on the morning of
Jan. 4, 1938, some 650 Davidson
students may exist blissfully un-
aware of its tolling and —thejr
toiling. )

This holiday period is four
days longer than that of last
year, which started on Tuesday,
Dec. 22, and ended January 5.

These ninety-six extra hours
of Christmas vacation will make
it possible for students who live
a long distance for Davidson to
have a reasonably long visit to
their homes. ’

Dances Are
Big Success

Jimmy Fuller’s Band Plays

For Gala Fall Frolics Last _

Week-End

On Friday night a small but
congenial crowd was present
to open Davidson's newest set
of dances. Jimmy Fuller and
his orchestra, from the Uni-
versity of North Carolina,
played at. the formal - Friday
night, at the tea dance Satur-
day afternoon, and at the in-
formal Saturday night. ¢

The Fall Frolies, as this mew set
was called, had tts biggest crowd

on Friday night. The grovp pres-+

ent at the danees echoed P. 11.
(Booby) Arrowsmith wo said
“This was the nieest set of dances
that E have ever attended while at
Davidson.” - -

This set was heldtin the Hotel
Charlotte ballroom, which was dec-
orated with an all-white motif, dis-
tinctly different from any previous
one used at Davidson dances.

Jimmy Fuller's orchestra — has
been featured throughout the Car-
olinas and Virginia. Among Fuller's
Most popular engagements were
those at the Tantilla> ballroom in
Richmond, Va, and the Pavilion at
Virginia Beach. The present head-
quarters of the band is the Univer-
sity of North Carolina, where the
boys in the band are students,

These dances ‘were also unique
in being the tirst sec under staclent
control of drinking. There was no
evidence ai any strong drink, cith-
er before or after the dance, ac-
cording to members of the super-
visory committee.

The Pan-Hellenic Council was
deeply: gratified at this and prom-
ises to renew efforts to get an ex-
ceptionally good band here for
Mid-winters. However as previous-
ly announced, no band has been
signed up yet.
