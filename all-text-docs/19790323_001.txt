3employes
reprimanded by
Grover Meetze

By KIRBY OWEN
Staff Writer

Director of the Physical Plant
Grover Meetze issued a repri-
mand to College employees Bill
Rolland, Ruben McIntosh, and
David Alexander on January
26, 1976, stating that ‘‘evidence
leaves no question that on
numerous occasions the normal
flow of work by other employees
has been interrupted to the
extent they have left their work
area because of loud com-
plaining, criticism of the super-
visor and operational policies of
the Physical Plant Depart-
ment.’’ The three men were
subsequently transferred for
jobs in which they were very
skilled to less demanding jobs.

The reprimand was issued
approximately two weeks after
. Rolland, a 1973 Davidson gra-
duate who had been working as
a mechanic in the Physical
Plant, drew up a petition critici-
zing certain job procedures that
were initiated on December 22,
1978.

These changes in job proce-
dures were that. paychecks
would be issued at 4 pm rather
that 9 am as before. Also that
the workers as of January 1,
1979, would be required to
punch their time cards at lunch
break as well as at the begin-
ning and end of the day.

The sixteen men who signed .
the grievance said they felt

that ‘‘because of the long lines

at the bank at 5 pm on Fridays |

and because of the distance
some of them would have to
travel from their work place to
the time clock, these changes in
policy would cause them some
significant inconvenience.

This petition was drawn up
on January 11, 1979 and on
January 12,.Rolland was put on
30 days probation. ‘‘I was put

Faculty approves evaluation procedures
ending year —long debate and revision

By BILL PEEPLES
Executive Editor

After a year and a half of gruelling debate and revision,
Academic Vice President Price Zimmermann’s first major task at
Davidson is complete,

Following a lengthy session Tuesday afternoon, the faculty
overwhelmingly approved the Code of Faculty Evaluation
Procedures. Professor of History Brown Patterson, chairman of the.
Professional Affairs Committee which fostered the Code, said ‘‘I
am delighted.”’

Many other topics were discussed at the Tuesday session, such
as self-scheduled examinations, so the final decision on the Code
did not receive major consideration.

Asked if the issue of self-scheduled exams was more pressing and
therefore caused a more hurried debate on the Code, Patterson
replied, ‘‘I think so. . . I surely do.”

“There had been so much revision and discussion among the
faculty for the last year and a half that no more debate was really
necessary, Patterson revealed.

Other factors contributed to the Code’s speedy passage. Both
Patterson and Zimmermann intimated that controversial sections
the Code were omitted, rendering it more palatable.

Originally, drafts of the Code called for an advisory committee to

evaluate the granting of tenure to a professor. This proposal
received too small a majority vote to be included in the Code.

Patterson believes that the PAC will not consider a tenure
advisory committee until the next academic year.

“On the docket now,’ but not spelled out in the Code, ‘‘is the
form in which students .will evaluate faculty members,” said
Patterson.

Though student evaluation may eventually become part of the
process in determining whether a faculty member shoud receive
tenure, Zimmermann said -he feels that for the present “‘we want

Faculty defeats Shi proposal

by overwhelming majority

8EPC recommendations still up in the air

By JIM GARRETT
News Editor
By at least a 2 to 1 margin, faculty members defeated a proposal -
that would allow professors the option of administering scheduled
exams, according to Academic Vice President Price Zimmermann.
After nearly two hours of discussion on Tuesday afternoon,

faculty members voted down,

istyry Professor David Shi’s

substitute to a Educational Policy Committee proposal.

Shi’s substitute, a faculty petition to establish a ‘dual system of
exams in which each professor had the option of either scheduling
or not scheduling a final exam, was circulated Febrary 2.

Shi’s argument to the faculty
focused on a professor’s ‘‘acade-
mic freedom”’ to schedule exams
“for whatever reason.”

Philosophy Professor Robert
Maydole, who opposed Shi’s
proposal, said ‘‘faculty mem-
bers are aware of an intricate
connection between self-schedu-
ling and Davidson’s Honor
Code.’’ He observed that fa-
culty members do not have an
inalienable right to deal with
suspicion of cheating by them-
selves when an Honor Code
exists.”’

SGA President Bruce Brown
said, “‘Shi’s proposal weakened
the Honor Code in the short
run’’ because students link self-
scheduling with the Honor
Code. _

Brown said he believes ‘“‘stu-
dent concern at Open Ends and
Forums served to deflate Shi’s
proposal among professors.”

“Davidson students demon-
strated their will, ” said May-
dole.

Shi said his efforts were “well
worthwhile’’ because ‘students
and faculty are now more aware
fo the many problems of self-
scheduling.’’ He said one reason
for circulating the proposal was
“professors assumed the right
to reaffirm self-scheduling
without communith input.”
Faculty members will vote A-
pril 10 on the Educational
Policy Committee’s recommen-
dation to maintain self-schedu-_
ling with minor alterations.

(Editor’s Note All eight EPC
recommendations were printed
on page 3 of the February 9,
1979 issue of The Davidsonian. }

English Professor Frank
Bliss observed three results of
Shi’s proposal. First, it increa-
sed awareness of the Honor
Code and its relation to self-
scheduling. Second, it magni-
fied the importance of a final
exam to a course and third, it
increased awareness of the “‘un-
settled” nature of self-schedu-
ling in the facutly.

Davidson students will have
to dig deeper into their pockets
in order to return here next
year.

College President Samuel
Spencer announced recently
that there will be an $452
increse in tuition and fees. .

The increase, as reported to
parents in a letter from Spencer,
stems from the. College
s effort to keep pace with
inflation and provide the cost of
living increases for the faculty
and staff.

Juniors John Jackson and

Andy Miller are actively seek-
ing the presidency of the 1979-
1980 Student Government _As-
sociation presidency. Sopho-

ex officio member of several
SGA committees and advisory
councils.

Jackson, a junior, served as
SGA Vice-President this year,

and was a senator last year. He E

said he feels his experience this
year as Vice-President would be
particularly helpful if elected
president. He said he does not
think, however, that his presi-
dency would be any less dyna-
mic because he would be taking
over ‘‘from the inside.”’

“Being vice President is valu-
able because I’ll know how to be
president," Jackson said. “At
