ROTC Students Form
Ranger Oriented Group

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Asst. Managing . Editor

About 20 ROTC students are
giving up free time and week-
ends to participate in a new
group called the Davidson
‘Ranger-Oriented Combat Sol-
diers (ROCS).

Junior Scott MaMichael,
the commanding officer of
the group, said that the pur-
pose of the ROCS is to ‘‘study
and acquire skills: and tech-
niques of field tactics.”’ Study
is concentrated in the area
of guerilla warfare—ambush-
es, escapes, and invasions.

The group meets once a _

week on Tuesday night to
study field tactics: Recently
the students have put what
they have learned to prac-
tical use in dummy drills.

The idea for ROCS was de-
veloped shortly after Christ-
mas by Capt. Theodore R.
Severn of the ROTC Depart-
ment. Severn talked to his
MS-I (freshman) classes
about his idea, and it caught
on with several freshmen.
Four juniors, including Mc-
Michael, heard about the
plan and involved themselves
with it, as did several soph-
omores.

The group was finally or-

ganized in late March,- when

leaders were named and two
groups formed. ‘Freshmen
Brad ‘Long and Tom Traxler
are leaders of the two groups.

The group is ‘‘strictly vol-
untary"’ according to Mce-
Michael, who said, ‘‘We plan
to be a separate part of the
ROTC Department next year,
with our own drill and class-

es.

McMichael said that the
group hoped to develop skills
that would be advantageous
to a person during his time
in military service.

Bill Emerson, who was ed-
itor of the now-defunct Sat-
urday Evening ‘Post when the
magazine,collapsed, will also
speak that morning.

Dr. Paul Crane, a_ medi-
cal. missionary to Korea, is
scheduled to conduct the Sun-
day morning worship servite
in the Presbyterian Church.

According to Zackery F.
Long, assistant dirgctor of
alumni affairs, ‘If the week-
end is to be a complete suc-
cess, then it is essential that
students take part, in the
festivities.

‘Alumni are interested in
what students at Davidson
are thinking today, and it is
important that students and
alumni become involved in
discussions about Davidson.”’

Long pointed té several ac-
tivities which have been
planned to make such dia-
logue between students and
alumni possible. On Satur-
day morning, ‘capsule cours-
es,’’ the college’s answer to
a continuing education pro-
gram, are planned, with stu-
dents invited to attend.

Also, there will be an alum-
ni reception for the senior
class following the alumni-
varsity football game, and on
Saturday.night Your Father's
Moustache will be in concert
for the whole college com-
munity.

to add something of South

Asia studies to their curric- -

ula since their faculty mem-
bers will also be involved in
the experience.’’

The seminar will begin with
an intensive two-week orien-
tation program on India at
Davidson. On July 11, the
group will leave the United
States and stop briefly in Is-
tanbul.

While in India, the seminar
will center in Delhi with trips
to Chandhigarh, Agra, Ba-
narus, Calcutta, and Darjeel-
ing, a hill town in the Hima-
layas.

The group Will also visit a
small village in South India
for a few days as guests of
Monroe Gimlour, a Peace
Corps volunteer who gradu-
ated from Davidson in 1968

and is the son of a Charlotte °

physician.

There will also be stops at
Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tai-
pei and Tokyo before they
return to the United States
on September 1:

Davidson faculty members
participating in the seminar
will be: Thomas F. Clark and
Samuel D. Maloney, religion
department; C. Earl Edmond-
son, history; James M. Fred-

rickson, chemistry; ® Dirk
