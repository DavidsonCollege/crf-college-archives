On Monday afternoon, Oc-
tober 4, junior Bob Feezor had
one of his best first times with a
hole-in-one on the shortest hole
at Davidson’s Covington Golf
Course. Feezor’s witness is his

never seen one before live.

The big golf fan hit the shot
with a seven iron at 3:47 PM. His
drive went high up and landed
only a foot and a half from the cup
before tolling back in for the

roommate Will Cobb, who had ©

Junior sinks hole-in-one

memorable shot. He useda Titleist
golf ball with plastic tees.
Feezor played barefoot,
while wearing navy blue
Duckhead shorts with a T-shirt.
The sky was clear witha 1-2 mile
per hour wind from the North-
west. The ball is in his room if
you would like to come by and
seeit. “Icouldn’t believe it,” said
Feezor “I?ll never play with that
ball again.”

-Home games in CAPS

When Davidson competed with Duke and Carolina

Holland continued from page 14

season on a controversial last-sec-
ond goaltending call against West
Virginia. They later missed a
chance at an NCAA tournament
bid by falling to VMI in the South-
ern Conference tournament, and
stayed home despite a finish among
the nation’s top ten with a 21-3
record.

There were future success sto-
ries under Coach Dreisell and his
assistant Holland, highlighted by

appearances in the 1968 and 1969.

Eastern Regional Finals against
Carolina. But the teams on which
Holland played were the precedent
setters: the first Davidson teams to
make a statement to the nation.
They cracked the top ten, knocked
off the big dogs and established
Johnston Gymnasium as a place
where Wildcats didn’t lose (unde-
feated from 1962-71). That 1964
team set a precedent that would

last well into the next decade.

It’s difficult to imagine how
different Davidson’s campus was
back then. All 900-plus students
here were white males, with many
more than today planning on going
into medicine or the ministry. An
even bigger difference from then
versus now was the size and spec-
trum of college basketball itself.
As the game exploded in popular-
ity and money-generating ability,
the College was unfortunately left
behind. Holland saw the changes
first-hand.

“The bigger schools upped the
ante by increasing recruiting bud-
gets,” Holland said. “We realized
that as the other schools decided to
play seriously they eventually
would bid us out ofthe game. That’s
essentially what happened.” The
result was that Davidson would
only visit the NCAA tournament
once in the almost twenty years
since Holland’s departure as head

coach. There have been some suc-
cess stories since then, though none
like the days of Lefty and Terry in
the 60s. Holland doesn’t see a re-
turn to glory as an impossibility,
however, for Coach Bob McKillop
and the Wildcats of the 1990s. “If
we.can get to the point where we
can win the conference and get
into the NCAA tournament, say,
two out of every three years, then
we’re talking possibly figuring out
a way to get back into that top 20
category on a regular basis. But
you take one step at a time.”

Butifwe never get back there,
Johnston Gymnasium still stands.
We can always dribble in, sink a
few buckets in the old steel rims,
and remember a day when
Davidson hoops stood among the
giants.
