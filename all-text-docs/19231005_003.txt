Some mighty funny things happened in |
Rock Hill on the day of the P. C. game. One

of these was the game.
about the rest.

Wonthrop girls at the
P. C. game reminded us of a slot machine

wonder if they were selling sandwiches for

a “knicker fund,” or some other such
worthy cause ?

P. C, Henderson was one of the most

| popular onlookers at the P. C. game—but

| Why shouldn't he be with such a famous
brace of initials?

Ignorance Is Bliss
We will admit that we are ignorant, but
how could we be expected to know that last
Friday was, ‘*Paint-Up Day” at Winthrop?

“Biddy” Curdts sure stood in with the

they gave him the icy stare.

‘appreciation to the authorities

Fresh—We_ had a@fairly good crowd of
girls yelling for us at the P. C. game.

Soph—Yes, real fair.

Howdy—Say,
in the Glee Club ?

Do—Oh, he is utility man.

Our latest definition of a dumb-bell—A
guy that sits up all night because his pajamas
are still down at the laundry. (See Mason
Field for particulars),

Dope Matheson started a train of thought
in his mind the other day but the engine
broke down. before he could accomplish any-
thing.

The inhabitants of the Barracks wish to
express through these columns their deep
for attach-
ing the new wooden braces to, the tank to
insure against its departure from upright
principles.

A recent improvement to the native habitat
of “Nicky” McAlpine ‘was the addition of a

| sawdust pile on the left side of the railroad
| track to match the one on the right side.

Besides adding to the symmetry of the busi- |

ness district of the town (?) it also enables

| Passengers to jump off from cither side of
the train.

A certain Freshman asked us the other day
when he was to be initiated into the student
body—the ultimate in pure boobery.

Vic Brown made so much money in his
clothing business last week that he was
heard consulting with a certain professor the
other day as to which stocks and bonds
would be safe ones for him to buy.

A girl is often pretty nice. But we wonder
| why it is that so often if she’s nice she’s not
pretty, and if she’s pe she’s not nice?

Ain’t It the Truth?

Dr. McConnell—Who were the parties to

Gracey—The Crooks and the Detectives.

Jim—What does Fresh Love

Al—He ought to sing bass.

Jim—Why ?

Al—Because he is such

FOUND—One stray cat loitering about
Shearer Hall the morning after the Glee

Club practice. (We reckon he got lost try-
ing to find his mate).

Ignorance—Why do they call a dogwood
tree ??

Bliss-—Beeause it has a bark.

Ignorance—Then can you tell me why an
old biscuit reminds one of an aged dog? ?

Bliss—No.

| Ignorance—Beeause it is covered with
_bites.

Senior—Say, Fresh, do you know Sam
Jones?

Fresh—No, sir. What's his name ?

Senior-—Who ?

KITTENS COPY VARSITY IN
LAST MINUTE WIN
Shelton Crosses Charlotte's Goal
Line in Final Period

Coach Rawson's Wildkittens opened their

football season Saturday with the heavy
‘Charlotte High School team, at Independ-
ence Park, in the Queen City. Like the

Varsity, the kittens won their game in the
final few minutes of the last quarter when

+a forward pass from Sapp to Shelton was
perfectly completed, resulting in a 6 to 0
score,

The teams were evenly matched, the

Freshmen making six first downs while the
Charlotte boys made seven. Forward passes
gave the Wildkittens four of their first |
downs. Punts were exchanged many times
during the game, sometimes for gain and
again for loss.

Charlotte High won the toss and chose to |
defend the cast goal. After the kick-off |
Coach Rawson’s boys held them for downs.
The teams ran up and down the field, and it
seemed almost an impossibility for either to |
be successful in their attempts to score. |
| Line plunging and passes were used to a!
|great extent. Some pretty football was dis- |
played and for a time it looked as though
the result would be a scoreless tie. For
| three quarters the tally was 0 to 0, but in the
|last six minutes of the final quarter, after |
| punts were exchanged, Shelton crossed the |
goal with a pass from Sapp. Hewlet failed |
| to perfect the drop kick for the extra point |
!and the score was 6 to 0. The few minutes |
|left soon passed with the Wildkittens in
Charlotte High’s territory at the finish.
| The game was featured by the playing of
| Sapp at full, and Shelton, who made the
| touchdown that spelled victory for Davidson.
| The work of Christian at right guard deserv-
led credit. His steady work at that post and
(his many tackles enabled the Wildkittens to
hold Charlotte for downs several times.

The line-up of the two teams follows:

Watt McCain announces as his latest
composition a little ditty entitled, “Her Maw
Named Her Petroleum Because She Was
So Refined.”

Fresh Ham-—E heard that Hilthouse trav-
eled over the mountains of Kentucky this
summer by mule-back. ;

Fresh Glenn—Yeah, that’s quite evident.

Just look at the daylight between his kn: es.

EFFICIENT SYSTEM INSTALL-
ED AT LIBRARY

Fil

This year an entirely. new system |

of keeping records of books taken |

out from the library has been install-
ed, Heretofore when a student ob-
tained a book he was given a page
in a ledger in which the name of the
book and necessary data concerning
it was written do) This system
!necessitated a at deal of work at
the-end of the year on the part of
the librarian{and it was very inetti-

cient, there being no w ay to tell how |

many books hi ud been lost until the
final checking-up at the end of the |
year,

However, the system inaugurated
this year is going to liberate the
librarian froma great deal of work |
and wil Jenable her to accurately
cheek up cach day on every book
that is overdue. When a student ob-
tains a bok it takes a little more of
his time, but it is befieved that he
will not mind this when he considers
how much he is aiding the libri ary
sometimes himself, when he might
forget to return a book and will tind
asum charged against him,

ach student fills out a ecard for
cach book taken out. On the card
is his name, date, name of the book,
its author and the number, In the
back of the book-he is taking out is
a from on which is stamped the date
the bok is tO be returned, and. this,
date is also reeorded on his card,
which is then indexed on the date of
expiration. At the end of this time
a check-up is casily obtained.
