RLUE RIDGE.

Among the six places scattered over
the United States where the Y. ML. C.
A. holds conferences for college men,
Blue Ridge in many ways surpasses them
all. High up in the “Land of the Sky”
away from the distraction of city and
sea shore, the students and professors of
the South will gather for recreation,
study and spiritual growth.

In past years Davidson has been con-
tented to stand aside while other South-
ern colleges stepped in and enjoyed the
many advantages which this delightful
place afforded. Georgia ‘Tech and
Clemson have been the leaders at former
conferences. “Vhey have built cottages
and have yearly sent large delegations to
represent them. Clemson has already
secured twenty-six delegates and Ga.
Tech has said that she will not be satis-
fied until her delegation reaches forty.
In the recent Western Conference, the
University of California sent ninety-
nine. If these colleges and institutions
can do this, Davidson certainly can send
at least twenty-five delegates this sum-
mer,

Here is an opportunity, Fellows, to
back up your Alma Mater. The con-
ference will last only ten days, June 13-
22, and every one who can should not
miss this splendid opportunity to back
his Alma Mater and at the same time
improve himself.

On to Blue Ridge with the Greater
Davidson spirit! You hae it!{ Don’t
let it die!
