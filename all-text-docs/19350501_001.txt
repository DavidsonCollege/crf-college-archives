The annual government inspection of
the R.O.T.C. unit held last Vriday,
April 26, was pronounced a success by
Captain Seifert, though he is unable, for
the time being, to give any indication
of the official report which will be made
concerning the work accomplished.

Captain Brand, representative from
the Fourth Corps Area headquarters in
Atlanta, seemed favorably impressed
with what he saw, and especially was
he pleased with the grades made on the
various examinations he gave. The aver-
ages on these examinations_are obtained
on a basis proportionate to the number
of hours spent on each subject, so that
the harder subjects, which are taken up

more fully, count for more than the
casier ones.

The battalion formed for roll call
at 2:10. Following this the compan-

ies moved to the stadium, where calis-
thenics were directed by Cadet Lieuten-
ant-Colonel Potter. Then there was an
alternate parade, after which the bat-
talion was inspected. Particular praise
