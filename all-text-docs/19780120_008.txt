O difficulties with program

What problems arise for the
international student at Da-
vidson? By questioning mem-
bers of the faculty and student
body who were close to some
of those students who left
Davidson, it is apparent that

regimented workloads are
rare. On beginning the ‘‘Da-
vidson Experience,’ foreign
student reaction ranges from
feeling swamped to dismay at
the ‘‘juvenile’’ system.

Director of Student Hou-
sing, Scotty Nicholls also ex-
pressed concern. ‘‘The unfor-
tunate thing is that we don’t

a small, academically -oriented
school in a small community.
A student coming from a
university with tens of thou-
sands of students in a large
city finds Davidson dull. A-

Ross says, ‘‘We’'ve realized
that the students abroad

there is no single answer,
although some broad pattern
are evident.

First, many people pointed
to the cukural difference.
There are the evident obsta-
cles caused by language bar-
riers, trying to make new
friends and being away from
families. Professor of Spanish,
Lois Kemp, points ‘out that
_ these are “‘usually first term
problems which are to be
expected, that are ironed oyt
with time.”

More fundamental is the
complete difference in aca-
demic objectives. Many for-
eign universities prepare the
student primarily for a final -
examination and a student
works at his own rate. Attend-
ance of lectures is optional and

have anything to offer the
older international student
whose academic interest can-
uot be satisfied at Davidson.”

Adding to the juvenile im-
age is the fact that foreign
students are generally restric-
ted to introductory courses, at
Davidson when often at their
home universities they have
finished the equivalent of 3 or
more years of college. And
some of the foreign students
resent having to eat with
freshmen when they are closer
in age to upperclassmen at the
eating houses.

Part of the culture shock
seems to have been in the
information the foreign stu-
dent receives before coming to
Davidson. Often students just
do not realize that Davidson is

they come.”’

Professor of Classics, Dirk
French points out that ‘‘in
many cases most [foreign stu-
dents] don’t stand to gain
anything tangible ‘‘because
academic credit is not granted

at home universities for Da-
vidson work. He further be-
lieves that the older foreign
student who comes to Da-
vidson is not faced with the
utter novelty of another uni-
versity, but is interested in
learning about American cul-
ture and travel.

The size of Davidson, the
non-existence of a true cross-
section of American life-styles
and values, and the lack of
cheap and available transpor-
tation, even to Charlotte, all

tact at least a segment of
American culture.

Another problem which
seems to affect many of the

eS

foreign students is money.
Although most foreign stu-
dents have full scholarships,
spending money seems to be
hard to get. Lacking spending
money limits everything from
an occasional movie to travel
during the holidays.

The problems concerning
the international student pro-
gram are far from simple. As
senior Ann _ Abernathy,
who spent her junior year in
Germany says, ‘There are two
sides to the coin. I’ve seen
both of them and I don’t have
any definitive answers.”’

Nicholls concluded, ‘‘It is
unfortunate that the majority
of the students do not make
the most of being exposed to
these really interesting peo-
ple.”

But the key is not to group
them all as international stu-
dents, but to consider each one
individual separately. They all
contribute something to cam-
pus life that we just don’t get
from any quarter.”

Zimmermann expresses views concern

By JOE CRAIG
Staff Writer
In an interview with The Davidso-
nian on Monday, T.C. Price Zimmer-
mann, Vice President for Academic
Affairs, offered his views as to why
the mternational student program
was currently faltering, as he listed

several specific problems.
Zimmermann readily agreed that
many of the international students’
complaints were valid. “Part of the
problem is that we thought we'd done
well by the students. But we had done
well in terms of what we thought their
needs are, and clearly had not been
paying attention to their concept of

. 5 = ee hes GT SONNE (Gree Ctrada

what their needs are,”’ he said.

When asked if Davidson’s bucolic
setting was part of the problem with
many students, Zimmermann con-
curred. “All or them want to learn
about the U.S. today, of course, and
they assumed that they would be in a
more cosmoolitan setting.

When they arrive at Davidson, it is

very confusing to many of them who.

have, say, attended«school in their
nation’s capitol,”’ he said.

‘Another problem, he stated, ‘‘oc-
curs when the international student
discovers a mismatch in age levels

when he or she reaches Davidson.
They complain that they are thrown
in with ‘raw’ eighteen year olds at the
eating houses, since many are already
graduates of their institutions in their
own country. They are disappointed
when they don’t find the Davidson
ae to be comparable in maturi-
y. ’

A third problem, stated Zimmer-
mann, is that the Davidson students
aren't going out of their way to meet-
the international students and make
them-comfortet!..

students here, there ought to be a
great deal more committment by al}
the College community. The interna-
tionei coordinator and the sponsoring
families can only do so much. A lot of
it’s up to the students themselves,”
he stated.

A final problem stems from the
different teaching methods and edu-
cational philosophies between Ameri-
ca and abroad, says Zimmermann.
~“The pace of foreign universities is
much more leisurely,’’ he said.

“Students lounge in cafes and talk

with other. students, etc. Then when
they get ready, they push hard in
their studies and take their exam.”
’ The reason their college experience
is more leisurely, he says, is due to
the rigorous curriculum they experi-
enced in high school; they are
mentally ready for a less-structured,
more independent course of study by
the time they reach college.

In contrast, the American educa-
tional system is deplorable, which
Zimmermann likens to ‘thirteen
years of intellectual kindergarden."'
