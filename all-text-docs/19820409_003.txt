Freedom of the Airwaves:
The Only Alternative

On May 3, WDAV will reduce its alternative music
service, currently the only student programmed shows,
from three hours a day to two hours a day. Reduction in
student broadcasting at WDAV is not unprecedented.
When WDAV began broadcasting as a carrier-current
station in 1969 it was entirely student run. By 1978 the
station was FM, had a broadcasting power of 18,542
watts, and was capable of reaching a possible

2,000,000. listeners. This new broadcasting power :

caused increasing concer by the trustees and adminis-
tration about the image of Davidson the station was
broadcasting. The minutes of an Oct. 27, 1977 Trus-
tees meeting state “that since by its nature a broadcast
station operated for the College will have an impact on
the institution’s public relations function, it is neces-
sary that the station and its programming be closely and
continuously supervised by the College administra-
tion.” With the increased broadcast power and admi-

nistrative concern about public relations came restric- |

tions on student programming. The students running
the station at the time, however, would accept none of
the restrictions. After:a term-long séries of conflicts
between the SGA, the student staff of WDAV, the me-
dia board, the WDAV board of directors and the trus-
tees. Most of the student staff left WDAV and the sta-
tion became basically what it is now, a professionally-
run classical station with three hours of jazz and rock
from’ 10 PM to 1 AM.

Most of the reasoning behind the recent cutbacks is
economics. The station, like-all organizations, is wor-
ried about supporting itself in the future. Alternative
broadcasting, .unlike ‘classical, brings little financial
support and even less trustee approval.

What the trustees of Davidson College should under-
stand is that WDAV, as a part of a liberal arts institu-
tion, adheres to its motto‘of being “your radio for the
arts.” In order not to become “your radio for the trus-

tees,” WDAV needs not only the trustees’ financial |

support but freedom of programming choice.
--With Wake Forest’s WFDD’s January 1 extinction,
WDAV bécanie the only rémaining alternative radio

station in the state. All other local stations are entirely

commerical and. automated. The public does not
