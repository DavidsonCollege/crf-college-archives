Eumenean and Philanthropic
Halls Scene of Willkie-
Roosevelt Debate

STUDENTS CAST VOTE

Local Plan Attracts Nation-
Wide Attention

sringing back to life the
former custom of debating be-
tween the society halls, the
Eumenean and Philanthropic
Literary. Societies will stage
a spectacular political rally on
the night of Tuesday, October
29, and will open the polls the
next day so students may reg-
ister their choice for Presi-
dent.

The Eus announced that their
speakers for the occasion will be
Bob Finley” for Roosevelt and
Drury Thompson for Willkie. The
Phis have chosen Frank Barker,
Paul S.. Crane and Jim Kerr.
Speeches will last about five min-
utes each, and two-minute rebut-
tals will be allowed.

Brass Band

The program, to be directed
from the porches of the halls by
the presidents of the literary so-
cieties, calls for numbers by an
old-time brass band between
speeches, and a glaring torchlight
parade afterward. During the ral-

ly, campaign leaflets, buttons,
cigars, stickers and posters will
flood prospective voters. State

posters for each state represent-
ed in the student body will be
made so students can rally around
their respective posters and try
to “carry” their states fof one can-
didate of the other. Topping off the
rally; students will report the next
day to vote for their favorite can-
didates.
Publicity °

Complete news coverage of the
rally is assured, for “Life” maga-
zine is considering carrying the
story, and pictures are to‘be sent
to “Collegiate Digest.” Newspa-
pers all over the state are to carry
full accounts of the event. A letter
received from the Republican Na-
tional Committee stated that com-
mittee headquarters will try to ar-
range to have telegrams sent here
from Willkie and McNary on the
night of the rally.

National Parties

The Republican National Head-
quarters» has sent considerable
campaign material, and the Demo-
cratic headquarters in Charlotte is
co-operating by supplying paper
bunting and streamers for decora-
tion, as well as buttons and cam-
paign material.

Presidents of the literary socie-
ties stated that besides having the
rally as a student get-together for
fun, it has been planned to awaken
interest in political issues and to
broaden the students’ viewpoints
on matters of national importance.

Cabinet Goes to Montreat to
Complete Plans for Fall
Services

Plans are still in the process
for the 19490 YMCA fall serv-
ices.

Shaw Smith stated that they
expecting very successful services
this fall. Letters are still being
passed between the “Y" and Rich-
mond. Sherrard Rice, last year’s
“Y” secretary, wrote that he had
talked with Dr. Thomas, the speak-
er, and was very enthusiastic over
his interview.

Youthful Appeal

Dr. ‘Thomas has“been very suc
cessful in the ministry yet he is
still a young man appealing more
to the students. Dr. Thomas was
Phi Beta Kappa at Washington
and Lee University. He was pastor
of the First Presbyterian Church
of Charleston, S. C., and Grace
Covenant Presbyterian Church of
Richmond, He was called this’
fall to the Union Theological Sem-
inary of Richmond, Va., to’ fill the
vacancy left, by the late Dr. Por-
ter Smith.

The YMCA Cabinet is looking
forward to the annual retreat held
at Montreat, N. C., the week-end
of November 9. They expect to
complete further plans for the fall
services and to map out future
plans for “Y” work and activities
coming later on in the year.

Last Year

“The fall services held last year
by Rev. S. S. Wiley of Thomas-
ville, N. C., were very successful
and‘very well attended by the stu-
dents. [t is hoped that they will
be as well attended- this year,”
Secretary Smith said.

The climax of the services will
be a communion service held the
last night for the entire student
body. The dates for the fall’ serv-
ices this year are November 12
through November 14.

Old ‘Glory, emblazoned in fire-
works, shone forth at the northern
end of the stadium Saturday night
as Davidson’s new arc lights were
extinguished to add impressiveness
to an unusual band display.

Spectators at the Davidson-Se-
wanee game thundered applause
and. sprang to their feet when a
large flag appeared in red, white
and blue flames. The band, formed
in a: large U. S., played the Star
Spangled Banner, outlining their
formation with sparklers and
