FORWARD STEPS.

This year will go down in the annals
of Davidson history as one in which a
remarkable record has been made by its
student body, a record at which future
generations may well look with pride.
Three great forward steps have been
taken in the abolition of all forms of
mild hazing, and in the passage of the
Blanket Fee and the Point Honor Sys-
tem.

The abolition of all hazing has taken
from Davidson the last trace of “prep-
schoolism” and has placed her along that
line on a footing with the few — best
schools in the South.

Since the Blanket Fee has been ap-
proved by the Faculty and heen passed
unanimously by the student body, there
is great hope that the Board of ‘Trustees
will think favorably of it. Should this
measure be put into practice its influence
for good could hardly be estimated. It
will insure the attendance of all the stu-
dents at the inter-collegiate athletic
games. Cheering will be better organ-
ized and the renowned Davidson spirit
will receive an additional impulse. More
victories will be won and consequently
Davidson’s influence be extended. The
Fee would place the Y. M. C. A. upon
a firm financial basis and insure better
programs and work. It‘ will mean_bet-
ter issues of the college publications and
life to the Magazine, the effect of which
will be felt far beyond the bounds of
the campus. The expense of each stu-
dent would to some extent be alleviated
and everything will be based on more
business-like methods.

The adoption of the Point Honor Sys
tem is a no less momentous victory. In
the future all the work of college activi-
ties will not be placed upon the willing
but overworked Senior, but distributed

among several, and result in more effi-
ciency a and training to more men.

Should this year’s record be equalled
each ne Davidson will stand ere long
first instead of second in the state ir
efficiency.

WEEKLY MEETINGS.

The debate last Saturday night in the
Eu Society was full of “pep” and was
very interesting, but sound argument
and authorities were almost entirely ab-
sent. The subject was: “Resolved,
That the ballot should be extended to
The following men upheld the
affirmative: Boggs, Matthews and John-
son. They contended that it would be
beneficial both to men and women for
women to vote, that women have proven
successful in other public work, and that
they should be granted the ballot be-
cause of the injustice of making them
pay taxes and not giving them the right
to vote.

On the riegative, Perry, Morrison and
Mallen argued that the suffrage should
not be extended to women because wo-
man’s place is in the home and not in
politics and that women secure their
returns for their taxes thru protection
by our laws. Maullen’s humor and sar-
casm worked well and was very effect-
ive. The judges decided in favor of the
negative.

All the orations and declamations on
Monday morning were very creditable.
Frierson, McCloy, Potts and Woods
gave declamations. Perry presented an
interesting discussion on the “Efficiency
of Germany in this War, and Why We
Should be Prepared.” Hoyt gave a
speech on the “Swiss Military System,”
and Morrison gave an oration on “In-
ternationalism,” discussing why all the
nations should combine into one gov-
ernment.

At the meeting of the Phi Society last
Saturday night the affirmative was rep-
resented by Berryhill, T. A. Finley,
Crisp and H. B, Craig; and the negative
by T. N. Morton, Overton. D, Monroe,
Pavne and Henderson. While good, the
debate was not what it should have been.
There was a tendency to repeat argu-
ments, and several good points were no!
touched. Crisp brought out some force:
ful arguments for the affirmative, and
Payne did welt for the negative. The
judges decided in favor of the negative.

At the Monday morning meeting the
regular exercises were omitted and the
meeting was taken up with the election
of officers. The following were elected
for the first term of next year:
Henderson, president ; W. C. Cumming,
vice-president; R. H. Ratchford. first
critic; C. F. Monroe, second critic; R.
D. Hall, secretary; W. T. Duntap, first
supervisor; W. C. Neel. second super-
visor. The following were chosen to
serve for the entire vear: J. A. Thames.
treasurer, and J. W. Mann, janitor.
W. H. Neal and W. C. Cumming were
elected to the Magazine staff. and J. W.
Clark and J. A. Thames to the debating

council.
