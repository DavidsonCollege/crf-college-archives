Rifle Team To Have
Many Veterans Back

Matches Are Being Sought With
Various Teams

A veteran team of sharpshooters will rep-

resent Davidson College on the Rifle Team

this year, as almost every man from last

year’s team returns for competition in the

gallery fhis“year. Those returning are:

Brock, J. L., Russell, R. D., Wiley, S. S.,|

Gregory, R. K., Graham,
H. W., Brohard, M. L.,

Av Js
with Curdts, F.

Burgess,

of men are those who shot in a shoulder-
to-shoulder match with Gastonia last spring.
The regular competitive season will not

open until after Christmas, but a call will |

be made soon for Freshmen and additional
upperclassmen interested in trying out for
the Rifle Team. After which practices will
be held in the ‘afternoon several times a week,
but not much shooting will be done until
after Christmas.

Shoulder-to-shoulder matches are being
sought with V. P. I., V. M. I., Clemson,
N. C. State, Gastonia, and possibly a few
others. Together with these, an average of
five correspondence matches a week make
up the routine of all the Rifle Team’s con-
quests.

Davidson was successful last year in both
shoulder-to-shoulder matches and winning
her share'of the matches. The Wildcat Rifle
Team was ranked ninth among teams in the
Fourth Corps Area, which is a creditable
showing considering the stamp of teams in
this section.

honored us with a visit while he was Presi-
