A STRANGE SEASON

Tomorrow afternoon about 4:15 while most of you
are on your way to see the taped instant replays and the
stop-action plays plus maybe a few straight plays for just
one time, fall sports at Davidson will quietly come to a
grinding halt.

Not that it is anything big. Most people are more
concerned with what unofficially begins at 7 tomorrow
night in that big building at the end of the track called
the Gym. Look to your left and see what we devoted to
basketball this week and then look to the right of this
and see what the stories say about the fall sports.

Our football team, victims of playing the best team
we have faced this year every week, has a tough way to
go to keep above the coveted .500 mark. The soccer team,
beset by more problems than Harry Fogleiman has tennis
racquets, is trying to finish strong in the tournament
down on their field, better known as the ROTC drill field.
Coach Heath Whittle drools at any mention of his cross-
country prospects for the next several years because of
the amazing record of his fledgling harriers, but has to go
call the roll for PE, even on Sunday, at the queries about
this season.

it has been a strange season. It started so good back
in September, but was tarnished by that journey to Char-
lotte where the Filthy Forty beat the Dirty Thirty. Then
football vanished for so long that it seemed we might
be listening to those hurting announcers on WBT-FM
forever between Rush Wilson commercials. (Do you think
they thought we would be listening?)

But the Alumni Office got on the stick and got the
football team booked to come home to see the alumni and
appear as part of the big weekend. They even brought
home that desire for fresh meat, Bulldog meat, that is.

And then off again. “He is on the 30, the five, he
scored,” drones the radio and interest wanes again. A
win means new records, a loss means disappointment.

Football at Davidson has improved despite a record
to the contrary. The football we play now is exciting, at
least when we are exposed to it in person. Football may
never, reach the stature of basketball, but with Homer
Smith continuing to build and improve the program, foot-
ball is going in the right direction. With a few improve-
ments and breaks, the other fall sports can do likewise.
The hope for success in all three fal! sports might not
be such a dream after all.

interest is really building for the varsity-freshman
basketball scrimmage tomorrow night at 7. The main
kindler of the flame of enthusiasm has been the continu-
ing reports that the frosh have been beating the Wildcats
in closed scrimmage rather frequently. Considering the

‘opposition we are meeting out here this year, this will
probably be the best game on campus this season.

As far as the Furman freshman football team was concerned, last Friday was

The 6-1, 180-pound quarterback
scored touchdowns on runs of
one, seven and 12 yards and two
touchdown passes, a 5l-yarder
to Mike Kelly and an 18-yarder
to George Hannen.

Hampton also completed 18 of
23 passes for 240 yards. Two of
his passes were dropped. He al-
so rushed for 74 yards giving
him 314 yards total offense for
the day.

Coach Bobby Brown said, “We
came from behind two times in

the first half. After that, we just -

kept building. The boys were de-
termined to win."

Other Wildkitten tallies came
on a one-yard blast by fullback
John Zaharov and a 30-yard
pass interception return by Ken
Crews. The interception came
with 34 seconds left in the game.

Fiddner Ruled Ineligible

By 80B REID
Assistant Sports Editor

Davidson’s on-again-off-again soccer
team must compete in the Southern Con-
ference Tournament without the ser-
vices of halfback Mac Fiddner. The
senior letterman from Kannapolis was
ruled ineligible for further competition
by conference commissioner Lloyd Jor-
dan last week for failing to earn enough
academic hours last year.

“] didn’t realize I was ineligible,”
said Fiddner, who passed 15 credit hours
in the regular session last year.” I didn’t
know the rule.”

Conference regulations state that a
player must pass at least 24 semester
hours during the year to be eligible for ‘
further competition.

“Last week the conference commis-
sioner sent the Athletic Department a
note saying that on an eligibility form
that the college submits, the number of
hours earned by one of the players was
listed as 15,’ soccer coach Harry Fogle-
man said. “The commissioner requested
we verify the number of hours.”

“As soon as the registrar's of- son’ to notify Davidson of the

He said. ‘The boys worked as

fo be run against the varsity.

fense and defense all their own,
one which was very much like
the one the varsity uses. We
think this will pay off-in the fu-

_ ture. We'll know for sure after

_Brown pointed out, “The backs
are working together, helping
each other out by making sug-
gestions. The quarterbacks and

They have gained confidence in
themselves and in each other.”

The Wildkittens ended the day
with 27 first downs and 433 yards

Wittenburg is coached by Bill
Edwards. who is the only man to
receive the Small College Coach
of the Year award twice in suc-
cession (1962, 1963). He has
coached 11 consecutive winning
seasons, led his team to six Ohio
Conference championships, and
has achieved the ranking of the
nation’s best small college foot-
ball team in 1962 and 1964 while
compiling a 76-15 4 record in. his
11 years as Wittenburg's head
coach. This week “the Tigers are
ranked eighth in the nation.

Standout offensive players for
Wittenburg are quarterback
Gene Laughman, fullback Octa-
vian Pechar and end Rod Miller.
Laughman is an accurate passer
and Pechar a powerful runner
while Miller needs only three
pass receptions to break the con-
ference record of 45.

Equaily noteworthy is captain
Larry Stockert who. leads the
defensive unit. In eight games
this season Wittenburg’s defcase
has given up only 32 points.

When asked to comment on
Wittenburg, Coach Homer Smith
said. “They are a great team.

The strong Wofford Terriers
charged from behind in a raz-
zle dazzle offensive display to
crush Davidson last Saturday,
40-28.

“Wolford was the biggest,

strongest team that we've play-
ed this year,”” said Coach Hom-
er Smith. “They were able to
control the offensive and defen-
sive line on us. They were also
able to move the ball inside on
us,”
“They were out to win and they
certainly weren't going to beat
themselves.’’ commented Smith.
The game Saturday was the
first game at home for Wof-
ford after five consecutive road
games. °

The Terriers used the smash-
ing inside running of Larry
Phelps and the passing of War-
ren Whittaker to beat the ‘Cats.
The first half saw both teams
move almost at will. Davidson
scored the first time it had the
ball with Johnny Walker getting
the TD on a one yard plunge.
