By Patrick MCARDLE
Sports Editor

The golf team shot a final round 322 to
finish 14th Tuesday afternoon at the second
annual Palisades Collegiate Classic. The 54-
hole event was played on the par-72, 6,797-
yard Palisades Country Club layout.

Chris Rollins °11 led all Wildcats by
shooting a 72 for the tournament. After sit-
ting tied atop the individual leaderboard fol-
lowing an opening round 67, Rollins scored
a lackluster 78 in round two Monday after-
noon.

Luckily, Rollins bounced back on
Tuesday to shoot a 72, his second round of
par or better in the tournament.

Despite his strong showing, Davidson
could not use his scores since he registered
in the tournament as an_ individual.
Co-hosting the event with Davidson, the
nationally-ranked Charlotte 49ers won the
team title with a final score of 856.
Davidson will tee off at the 2008 Southern
Conference Championship April 20-22 at
the Country Club of South Carolina in
