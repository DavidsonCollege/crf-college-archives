BLUE DEVILS INVADE CAMPUS TONIGHT

CAT TRAX

As They Follow the Red and
Black

By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

Ce ofp
Tonight’s clash with the Blue Devils

from Duke University should easily be

the outstanding thrill dispenser of the

season thus far. This is the Wildcat’s

year to howl in the great old court

game, and we won’t be at all taken
back if the dope bucket is spilled forty
different ways here tonight. Tle Duke
team is well balanced and is blessed
with plenty of able substitutes, but
they will play their best game of the
season if they cop that scrap tonight.
So we believe.

We hear that “Fesser Faul’s
Monograms” were about the most
surprised young men that ever
walked off the floor. That victory
in Charlotte was one of the greatest
in recent years. Glory to the Cats
for being the team to do the dirty
work. Looks like they are out to
make trouble from now on.

The varsity and freshmen combined
to make “Monk” and “Tex” enjoy the
past week-end tremendously. The
double: barrelled win over the old
hangout of the Davidson coaches didn’t
hurt any feelings around here. Lenoir-
Rhyne and Elon added to the general
merriment, helping the locals to salt
away one of the best basketball weeks
in history.

Rumors are going about to the
effect that John Currie is to re-
enter school here at an early date.
Great news if true, but we are not
disposed to put much stock in it
until we actually see those long
legs speeding around the track.
Johnnie is good for ten points in
any meet—his return would mean
a much greater track season.

Hardly know what to think about
this little love fest between the Bean-
eater from Boston and Young Stribling.
Sharkey is up to his usual tactics of
slinging a line of bull ten miles wide to
the eager public, but, for that matter,
so is Stribling. Sharkey looks the best
to us at present, though we would like
to be wrong in the matter.

The approaching trip of David-
son basketball teams through Vir-
ginia should plant the Red and
Black standard firmly in enemy
soil. Lynchburg College ought not
to give serious trouble, V. P. I. and
Virginia should succumb, with the
latter giving plenty of resistance,
and we are not so sure about V.
M. I. and W. and L., though we be-
lieve the former will be conquered.
The Generals are the boys likely to
spoil our little dream of a triumph
tour. To be sure, any one of the
above quints may turn out to be a
regular Wellington to Monk’s
Napoleonic hopes, but, just the same
we like to plan it all out now.

Dr. Charlie, every Wildcat’s right
hand man, is already talking football.
The sight of sixty hardy lads double-
teaming, punting and passing this past
week was a little too much for the
old boy, so he broke down and con-
fessed that next fall’s eleven would be
a good one. You're right, Charlie,
those Cats are coming back to tear
‘em down.

The four classes of the college
now have ‘a challenge that they
can’t afford to ignore in the inter-
class boxing tournament. Now is
the time for all good fighters to
vent their feelings for the h of
OLD '30 or what have you? Cap-
tain Pritchett deserves a world of
credit for the promotion of this
idea. We hope that it will lead to
inter-collegiate boxing at Davidson.

Every day brings the time a little
closer when horsehide will plump into
glove and willow will lean against it.
For the first time in a good many years
there istreally good material in sight

for baseball and you can trust. Monk |

to make the most of it. With a rea-
sonable amount of hitting the Wildcats
should ride high and far.

CALHOUN STARS

Virginia Tech is Beaten in Fast
Contest

The Wildcats went wild last Thursday
night and furnished one ofthe biggest
upsets of the present season by decisive-
ly trouncing the crack Charlotte Mono-
gram Club 41 to 27. The Monnies were
top heavy favorites to down the Cats but
the Davidson men entered the contest
with a determination that would not be
denied and soon had the game safely in
the bag.

For nine minutes the Charlotte boys
did not score, while the Wildcats were
piling up eight points. A rally gave the
Monnies a short-lived lead of 9-8, but
the Cats soon drew away never to be
headed again. The half ended with the
Davidson team leading 15-12, and as the
final period progressed, they steadily in-
creased their margin of victory.

Glenn Calhoun’s remarkable shooting
gave the Cats the game. This lanky
star amassed a total of nineteen points
to easily lead the entire field. He was
ably abetted by Captain Pritchett and
Johnson of Davidson: Goodson featured
the contest with his close guarding.

The Wildcat victory, though unex-
pected, was a triumph of the first water
and in no way was it a fluke. Superior
play and fight won for the adherents of
Younger’s system.

DAVIDSON 27, V. .P. I. 12

V. P. I. fell before the speeding Wild-
cat five in a thrilling and snappy court
encounter last Saturday night in Alumni
gymnasium. The score was 27-12, mark-
ing the fourth straight win for the local
basketeers. Throughout the contest, the
Davidson quint showed marked superior-
ity although the visitors sank two goals
before the local unit began to function.
The first half was featured yby the guard-
ing of both teams, and neither was able
to make the long ones count. Half time
however found the Cats resting on a 12-8
lead.

Davidson held the visitors to a lone
field goal in the final canto, while she
was piling up a good. number of points,
Calhoun leading the attack. Bill Good-
son, Captain of last year’s fresh team,
continued to prove his worth as a guard.
He was in every play, it seemed.

The Virginia lads were led in scoring
by Looney. Brown, center and captain,
played a sterling floor game.

All Athletic Teams
Conquer in Past Week

Eight Contests Won by Davidson
Men

Last week was a banner one for the
red and black., The Wildcats had eight
athletic contests, and all eight were chalk-
ed up in the “won” column, The var-
sity basketeers were in the limelight,
taking the’ measure of four strong op-
ponents in Lenoir-Rhyne, Elon, Virginia
Tech, and Charlotte's crack Monogram
tiv. The freshmen, not to be outdone,
added the names of Belmont Abbey,
Statesville High, and V. P. I. fresh to
their list of basketball victims, And
just to make the week a highly success-
ful one, the Wildcat wrestlers outpoint-
ed the matmen of Concord “Y” by the
1-2 to 1-12 in the latter's
own back yard.

score of 15

The outstanding contest of the week
was the encounter with the Monograms
in which the Wildcats triumphed by the
decisive score of 41 to 27, Although the
outcome was a ‘surprise to many, the
professionals were clearly outclassed from
the start. Only once during the game
was the score in their favor, when they
were leading 9 to 8 near the end of the
first half. The lead was short-lived and
at the half the count stood 15 to 12 in
favor of Davidson. In the second: half
the Cats continued to pull away from
their opponents, the final score being
Davidson 41, Monograms 27,

Calhoun, Wildcat forward, was the
high scorer for the week with a total of
54 points for the four games. Capt.
Pritchett and Johnson were next with
41 and 29 points respectively. Martin
was the big gun for the frosh with 27
points, followed by Milton with 19 and
Mathis with 17.

The following are the scores for the

Second Time

In the second wrestling bout of the sea-

plers over-came the Concord Y. M. C.
A team 15 1-2 to 1 1-2. The Davidson
team won one match by a fall and three
on time decisions, with Herriott and his
opponent fighting extra time to a draw.
On account of the Concord team’s failure
to have entries in the’ light-weight and
heavyweight classes these matches were
not held.

In the 118 pound class Cowan won his
match on time decision. Flythe in the
128 pound class was the only wrestler to
win his match with a fall. Brown and
Russell won their matches by time de-
cisions in the 138 pound and 148 pound
classes respectively. After the bout Cap-
tain Hill and Warren of the Davidson
team staged an exhibition match.

Grapplers to Meet
Strong Foes on Trip

V. M. I. and Carolina to be Met
on Trip

Saturday, Captain Tom Hill and the
Davidson wrestlers will meet the V. M.
I, team at Lexington. They are sched-
uled to leave here Friday and to wrestle
there Saturday. Monday, they will leave
Lexington and journey to Chapel Hill
where they will meet the Carolina grap-
plers on Tuesday. They will return to
the Davidson campus Wednesday.

Last year the Wildcats lost to the
V. M. I. aggregation due to an uninten--
tional but costly decision of the referee
who awarded the match to a V. M. I.
man after Herriott had pinned his shoul-
ders to the mat. The final count was
9 1-2 to 13 1-2 in favor of the cadets.
Christenbury jumped from the 155 pound
class to the unlimited and threw Hasse
for the only fall of the encounter. Flythe
got a time advantage on his opponent
while Jeff Garison, captain of the team,
tied a beautiful match to account for
Davidson's other points. The Wildcats
with six of last year’s men back in the
line are due to go well against the Cadets.
Hasse, Smith, Woodward, and others
are back for V. M. IT,

The Cats emerged on the long end of a
13 1-2 to 7 1-2 score after the Carolina
match last year. Brown, Christenbury,
and Hill all won their matches on time
advantages. Flythe and Garison dupli-
cated their performances against V. M. I.
Flythe winning on time and Garison ty-
ing Abbot in one of the most. thrilling
} matches ever held in the state.

The mén who will probably make the
trip for Davidson are: Cowan, Flythe,
Brown, Herriot, Brohard, Brock, Chris-
tenbury, Hill and Warren.

Currie Returns

John Currie, ex-Captain of the
Davidsonian Track Team and
now President of the Davidson
Athletic Association, re-entered
school on Wednesday morning
and is registered for the Spring
Semester.

Currie is the dash’ champion of
the Carolinas and his return
means much toward a success-
ful track season. He expects to
start work-outs immediately un-
der the supervision of Capt.
Norton G. Pritchett, varsity
track coach.

Though no final statement has been issued
as to the details of this event, the tenta-
tive plan is to have each of the four di-
visions of the student body represented
in classes ranging from one hundred and
fifteen pounds to heavy-weight. Those se-
lected to take part in the contest as re-
presentatives of their respective classes
will begin a period of intensive training
under the direction of Capt. Pritchett
which will last for about ten days or two
weeks. At the end of this time the tourn-
ament proper will begin. Scores will be
based on a system of points for placing;
ten points for first place, five for second,
three for third and one for fourth, the
class making the highest score to be de-
clared the winner.

Although as yet the only thing at
stake is the class championship. it is pos-

| sible that a cup for the winning class and

medals for winners in the different divi-
sions may be obtained.
