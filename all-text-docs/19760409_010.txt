The Davidson baseball team
split a doubleheader with
Richmond and lost ‘to the
Citadel in last week’s play.

On Saturday the Wildcats
hosted the Richmond Spiders
and were decimated in the first
game of the afternoon, 0-15.
Joel Tew started on the mound
but was forced to retire after
only 1% innings of play.

He was followed by a host of
relief pitchers including Tim
Purcell, Ken Norwood and
Mike Linz. No phase of the
Wildcat’s game was sharp as
Richmond hitters battered

Davidson pitchers and Wild-
cat hitters were unable to
create any offense.

In the second .game
Davidson came back to trim
the Spiders 2-1 behind the
strong pitching of Mike Hall.
Hall, who has been the Wild-
cats’ most consistent hurler
this season, limited Richmond
to three hits.

Ironically, pitcher Joel Tew
who has not been able to bring
his throwing game into form
yet, provided batting fire-
power as DH by hitting a
home run. Mark Swmewait
doubled, stole third then came
home on a wild pitch to give

the Wildcats the winning run.

On Monday Davidson
dropped a very close 2-4
decision to the Citadel. As
Coach Palmer Muench
phrased it, ‘‘We were within
six inches of winning the
game.”

The six inches Muench
referred to was a bases loaded
triple which fell just beyond
the reach of speedy center-
fielder Mitch Stone to score
three runs in the 5th inning.
Freshman pitcher Ron Cannon
went the distance, and aside
from the 5th inning, had a
solid performance on the
mound.

The Wildcats travel to
Wake Forest on Thursday for
an afternoon game and then to
William and Mary on Satur-
day for a doubleheader.

Head Baseball Coach
Palmer Muench was recently
honored by being named to
coach an all star team which
will travel to three South
American countries. this
summer.

The team, known as the
Sports» Ambassadors, will be
composed of several out-
standing collegiate baseball
players from all across the
United States. Its purpose will
be to carry a Christian
message to the people of
Ecuador, Nicaragua, and
Columbia.

When asked to comment
about the trip, Muench stated,
“‘T am really excited about
going. It will be a witnessing
experience. We will be gone for
about six weeks, from June 11
through the end of July.”’

Blue Devils

Davidson Ruggers upped
their spring season record to
2-2-1 with a 10-6 victory over
Duke Saturday. The loss was
the Blue Devil’s first of the
season.

Duke threatened early in the
game by keeping the ball close
to the Wildcat goal line. But
outstanding defensive play
from Davidson’s wing for-
wards, Bruce Wallis and Jeff
Morrow, thwarted all drives at
the Davidson end zone.

In spite of poor field posi-
tion in the early going
Davidson managed to score
first when all time Southern
Conference 440 yard champion
Mark Connors outraced Duke
defenders for a 74 yard try.
Dan Boggus made it 6-0 with
the extra point conversion.

The Blue Devils fought back
with a pair of field goals to tie
the match. But Joe Craig
managed to break through the
Duke scrum for a try which
put the Wildcats on top to
stay.

Next Saturday’s match will
be at Davidson at 2:00 against
the Marines from Camp
Lejeune.
