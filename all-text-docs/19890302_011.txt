“IMACtion ~——

Insatiables, Caroline’s
Dream and Wolfpack
emerge as champions

By LARRY SLEDGE

A great deal of publicity surrounded
last Saturday’s basketball game with~
Central Florida, a game that was billed
“the end of an era.” But another era
came to an end two days prior to that
game. As. public address announcer
Carter Garrett introduced the officials
for the A-league finals, the last of the
games in the championship series, the
final game of IMAC basketball in
Johnston Gym, was set to begin, intent
on determining the best team in the
league.

The women’s finals pitted the Insati-
ables against the Old Women. The In-
satiables had won both prior meetings
between the two teams, but this en-
counter opened on acontroversial note.
Volleyball coach Rebecca Hawkins
had scheduled an engagement for her
team and required all players, includ-
ing the Insatiables’ LaVetta Dawkins,
‘to attend. But mysteriously, as game
time approached, the Insatiables squad
included Dawkins, leaving the Old
Women without their top rebounder
Coach Hawkins, and the Insatiables at
full strength. _

The Insatiables dominated every as-
pect of the game. This fact was clearly
illustrated by the sight of Dawkins con-
tinuously rejecting shots by Judy Kren-
zer without even jumping. Dawkins
even managed to hit one for three:
three-point land. Leslie Urban added to
the slaughter by pouring in 26 points.
Salt was tossed into the wound by the
clock operator, who inadvertantly ran
20-minute halves instead of 18. When
the smoke had cleared, the Insatiables
had successfully defended their cham-
pionship with a 59-26 drubbing of the
Old Women.

Phi Delt’s (previously) Undefeated
Champs attempted to accomplish the
same feat in, their series with third
West’s Caroline’s Dream, a match-up
which featured a serious contrast of
styles. Some people refer tot he defend-
ing champs as. the ““wide-bodies,” as.
most of them play for the football team.
With three players over 250-pounds
and an average weight of about 210, the
Undefeated Defending Champs play a
very physical game, which usually
succeeds in intimidating the opponents

and even sometimes the referees. Caro-
line’s Dream, on the other hand, played
more of a finesse game, centered on the
fast break. Even though their offense
rested almost entirely on the shoulders
of their hall counselor Kevin Burns,
they got steady performances from
Kevin Grooms, John Beyer, and Andy
Hunt to aid them. IMAC’s decision to
have three referees for the game may
also have helped them, for the extra
man may well have allowed some fouls
to be seen that otherwise wouldn’t
have. Although the offensive contribu-
tions of the freshman members of the
team was minimal, Caroline’s Dream
came away with two victories over the
Undefeated Defending Champs (39-35
and 50-38), will eventually be wearing
the championship t-shirts, and dealt a
crushing blow to “wide-body” basket-
ball.

The feature presentation of this ex-

travaganza, though, was the A-league |

final, the best of the best. This year’s
final showcased two arch-rivals, SAE’s
Wolfpack and KA’s Really Nice Guys.
The two teams had met twice previ-

- ously and the series was tied at one

each. At stake this time was the title of
champion. The Wolfpack would have
to win twice, for they had been knocked
into the loser’s bracket by KA earlier in
tournament. In the first game, Greg
es scored 22 points as the Wolfpack
devoured the Really Nice Guys 59-42,

“setting the stage for a winner-take-all

final game.

The presence of nearly 200 fans illus-
trated the importance of the game. The
first half gave. the fans exactly what
they. came to see--IMAC excitement.

_The Wolfpack led through most of the

first half, but by halftime, the Really

_Nice Guys had evened the score to 22-

22. The second half featured more of
the same, but the difference in the game
may well have been the defensive per-
formance of the Wolfpack’s Charles
Bratton. The responsibility of guarding
A.J. Morgan throughout the game, and
held him to 14 points of his own. Be-
hind his stellar performance, the
Wolfpack left with 45-39. victory and

out another year of IMACtion basket-
ball and ending another.era.

In the CAA, Davidson would be
in a conference in which it could
hold its own in many sports such
as soccer, volleyball, basketball,
baseball, and: men’s and women’s
tennis. This conference would
also renew some old Southern
Conference ties with Richmond,
East Carolina, William and Mary,
and American. The CAA would
also. bring such schools as Navy
and James Madison with Lefty

tougher than the CAA and

Another problem is the distance
between the schools. The Sun

Virginia to Florida and across to
Alabama and Kentucky. It would
bea long drive for say the baseball
team to go to South Alabama or ~
South Florida for a series. An-

of a new conference. With UTC

bunch of schools together, if UTC
goes to the Metro Conference,
and forming a CAA North and

at least 6 other schools such as
some Southern Conference
schools and maybe University of
Maryland Baltimore County.

Although being an independent
is far from ideal, Davidson should
resist joining the Big South unless .
nothing else is possible in, say, the
year 2050.
