Is The Wildcat Lost?

Where's that vaunted Wildeat spirit these
days? It was very much in evidence at the
Carolina game in Charlotte Tuesday night.
But it hasn’t been too much in evidence
around the campus lately and especially in_
the student campaign quarters.

We can cheer and yell fora fighting David-
son basketball team=why ‘can’t we show a
little spirit for a fighting Davidson? Sure,
it’s a big goal. Forty thousand dollars ain’t
hay. It’s a challenge.

The William and Mary game ‘was a chal-
lenge, too, but we didn’t make with a funeral
dirge the night before it. The Wildeat spirit
has always risen to the oecasion before when
the student body weeded it. Is it going to
sit hissing in chapel this time?

Lecture Series

Every year the Faculty Lecture Commit-
tee presents three four authoritative
“outside’’ lecturers who speak on matters of
current world issues. Among the best in re-
cent years were Ellis Arnall, former gover-
nor of Georgia, who spoke on the political
problems of the South, and Dr. Clelland of

or

-Duke—who-speke-on-the-Palestine-situation—}

The committee attempts to get good lec-
turers, within the means of their disposal.
They try to pick open dates, as well as they
can judge from six months in advance.

This fall they presented Dr. No-Yong Park,
an authority on China, who presented the
Chinese point of view. Last Tuesday night,
Mr. Thomas Jefferson Hamilton, United Na-

tions correspondent for the New York Times, °

who spoke on the work of that organization
since its founding.

EDITORIALS...LETTERS...FEATURES

With the exception, of some compulsory
attendants, the students have not supported
the Lecture Series. It may geythat the stu-
dents are not interested in w Na events, Or
it may be that the particular speakers chosen
hold no interest fom the students. Or, again,
it may be that there are too many conflicts
on the lecture dates.

Whatever the case may be, the students
svould do well to make some expression of
their interest in the series, or some sugges-
tions for improving it. As the matter stands,
it is hardly worth the committee’s time plus
several hundred dollars to put on a lecture
that only a handful of the students show
an interest in.

Chapel Programs

Student Body President Carl Pahl is tak-
ing steps to add some zip to student day
chapel programs. fle is trying to qucourage

individual student

more participation and
organizational programs. Last Thursday's
band concert and a program by the: Male

Chorus this Thursday were the first ina
propected series of student programs.

Any organization interested in putting on
a program should get in touch with Carl. It
will be good publicity for the organization
and may make life at chapel more interest-
ing.

Of tell
your efforts will-be met bya volley of the

course, you never ean whether
paper products of amateur aeronautical en-
gineers, the crude inattention of those suf,
fering from third period writs, or the smirks
of connoisenrs of ambiguity——but it’s a good
experience and aiworthy effort.

Letter

Another tetter in the * A Student’ Bob
Johnson dispute was received by The David
sonian this week. Tlowever, it is not. being
printed for two reasons. In the first place,
it was addressed to Bob Johnson and not to
the editors.

The letters-to-the-editor column is a forum
of opinions, student and otherwise. directed
to the publie through the medinm of the
paper. Tt is not a column for publie corre:
spondence,

Tn the second place, the letter was signed
only.as ‘A Student.”? Although “A Student?’
is getting to be quite a personality in these
columns, it is not good newspaper technique
nor has it been the poliey of the Davidsonian
(recent exceptions not withstanding) to pub-
lish anonymous letters.

The Davidsoniam wants to print all printa-
ble student opinion, However, any opinion
that is worth to be worth a
signature. Any contributions made ‘to the
paper by staff members exeept straight news
is printed under the writer’s name. All edi-
torials may be assumed to be written by the
editor initialed otherwise, in ‘which
case an investigation of the masthead will
reveal the writer's identity.

Is it fair, then, that all letters be
signed? So please, no more anonymous let-
ters.

Paging The Professors

By NEIL LEACH

PROF. F. M. SINCLAIR
The call to graduates of Davidson
to return to their Alma Mater to
teach must be most compelling, for
a great number of our faculty has

accepted that call. One of this
group is Prof. Frank M. Sinclair.
Prof. Sinelair didn't enjoy the

life of a Davidson freshman for one
main reason; he went to State his
first two years of college. At the
end of his sophomore year there he
had heard such favorable
of Davidson that he enrolled here to
finish his college education. As an
major;

Prof. Sinclair graduated in the class
of 1937, Later he went to the Uni-
versity of North Carolina and there
erate his master’s degree.

Then along came the war. Prof.
Sinclair, then a member of the North
Carolina National Guard, iminediate-
ly went into the army as a private.
Fortunately, that rank didn't hold
him very long. It was Pvt. Sinclair
who went into the Officer's Candi-
date School at Camp Davis, N.C
but a very shiny gold bar bedecked

each shoulder as he left this camp
which produced wonders. Siice he
had always wanted to see the beau-
tiful coral strands of the Pacific,
our professor decided would
choose this theater—this was after
he got his orders, of course. At’the
University of Hawaii, Lt, Sinclair

he

studied the complication of radar as
part in anti-aircraft
tactics, afterwards his one
shoulder bar was replaced by two
silver ones.

It was Capt. Sinclair wKo was
in charge of all mobile anti-aircraft
groups in the Iwo Jima campaign.
His groups hit the beaches soon
after the Marines and set up their
protective positions. After Iwo Jima,
Capt. Sinclair covered almost the
whole.Pacific Theater and “wasted
lots of time,” so he says. It is bare-
ly possible to travel farther from
his native Wilmington, N.C. home
than he did-during his tour of duty.

In 1946, soon after turning in his
uniform, Prof. Sinclair went back
to the University of North Caro-
lina and did more graduate work

Sinclair taught accounting at Ca-
