Homecoming Revives Painful Memory

I have a homecoming
memory three years old. It
begins after about five weeks as
an alpha number, just long
enough to know what mixers
and blind dates could do to your
health, ego and welfare.

It begins with the realization
that maybe a little insurance,
such as the girl back home,
would be a good idea for three
days and then stand in a stair-
well 30 minutes waiting for a
busy signal in the phone booth
while the guys behind you in
line bang on the glass im-
patiently with their coins.

But she will be there on
Friday and the next five days
are a rice paddy inside from
waiting. Fortunately there are
no reviews that week; they all
come the Monday after.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Preparations are in panic by
Thursday night and work is
finally completed on an award-
winning freshman display of a
jerseyed opponent revolving
headfirst in a commode labelled
“Flush ‘Em, Cats.'' Other more
obscene banners with a cruder
ambiguity will be flying from
dorm windows by Saturday.

The real flush comes Friday
at noon when every three-term
whimp is evicted from Belk
Dorm to make room for in-
coming dates. But if you miss
all this and drive into Charlotte
to pick up your date at the
Station you still have to face a
z00.

You wait and stare at the wall
of schedules while a slice of
New York City streams around
you until a well-tuned diesel

pulls in from your home town.
You see her face first as she
shoves her way through
luggaged people and it is
smaller than you imagined the
past week, but nevertheless she
is there, a part of your next two
and half days.

You drive back to Davidson to
show her around the campus
like a war veteran and then
check her into Belk just to finda
third body already mattressed
into your room back in the
freshman dorm. There will be
time, though, and both of you
are ready to take in everything
on the schedule by six that
evening.

Culture before pleasure,
however, and an opera by
Strauss precedes the real party
later on that night featuring

Student And Reader Express
Diverse Views On Candidates

To the Editor:

I have several objections to
Peter Celentano’s scathing at-
tack on my alleged “offensive”
letter of Oct. 5. The difference
in our letters being that my ob-
jections are well-founded. Mr.
Celentano claims I have
characterized ‘‘Tricky’’ as a

‘deceitful, incompetent
criminal.”
This is an interesting ac-

cusation. If you would care to
reread my letter, Mr. Celen-
tano, you will realize that all I
have written is the typical pro-
Nixon propaganda rhetoric
responsible for our hallowed
President's support. Perhaps
Mr. Celentano has a guilty con-
science?

But now that YOU have men-
tioned it, how should we explain
the pilfering of $250,000.00 of
taxpayers’ money for eight
separate campaign purposes,
‘“‘forgetting’’ to list his
$240,000.00 San Clemente estate
with the $60,000.00 stucco wall
built with taxpayers’ money on
his financial statement, or the
extensive sabotage effort of the
Democratic campaign in-
cluding the Watergate
burglary, and illegal campaign
funding from corporations and
Mexico! (Sources: G.A.O.,
F.B.I., Mr. Kaneklides ex-
plains: *‘Boys will be boys."’ Do
we want “‘boys” running
America?)

Mr. Celentano claims that I
forgot ‘‘that George McGovern
allegedly used the youth vote to
force an unworkable platform
through the Democratic com-
mittee. Young people have the
highest percentage of
politically active citizens.
These people are also well-
informed. A true Democracy
requires an informed elec-
torate.

It is absurd to believe that the
sabotage efforts were solely the
ideas of bungling underlings.
Nixon has also achieved in-
ternational acclaim as a War
Criminal for continuing to pour
more bomb-tonnage in  anti-
personel bombs alone on Viet-
nam than the total tonnage of
WW II. as. well as the
widespread destruction of life
from napalm and the spraying
of herbicides.

There is no reason to believe
North Vietnam would not

release our POWs, if we stop
bombing them and pull out.
Nixon claimed 14,000 French
prisoners were detained by the
North Vietnamese after their
peace-treaty; the very next day
the French government denoun-
ced that as a blatant lie! All
prisoners were in fact released.

McGovern's program ac-
tually calls for a return to
traditional values and the ideals
of our Founding Fathers: a
Free Enterprise system with
social responsibility.

The economic reform consists
of the rich people paying the
same tax percentage as the fac-
tory worker--Is this unfair?
Taxes on wages and salaries
would not be increased one
cent.

Nixon's large following
reflects the carefree attitude of
Middle America to take the
political scene seriously. Why
won't America listen to Carl
Rowan, Dr. Galston, or Allen
Ginsberg?

Wake Up, America!
McGovern IS for the People.

To the Editor:

On November 7th American
voters will face a contrived
choice between two leftists.
Richard Nixon is (1) trading
with the enemy, (2) feeding our
wheat to the enemy to keep him
strong, (3) making disar-
mament agreements with an
enemy who has broken 24 out of
the last 25 agreements, (4) now
operating the country as a dic-
tator!

On the other hand, McGovern
is leading a pack of militant
street revolutionaries, in-
cluding Rennie Davis who has
spoken at Davidson, Abbie Hoff-
man, Ralph Abernathy and a
gaggle of socialist professors.
McGovern has the solid backing
of Americans for Democratic
Action, including Hubert Hum-
phrey, Ramsey Clark, John K.
Galbraith.

Our hope, it seems to me, is to
go ahead and elect Nixon, and
then wake up and begin to
pound on a new Congress and on
Nixon to head off the socialist
trend that goes on and on under’

Republicans or Democrats.

Wallace said it right: ‘‘There
isn't a dimes worth of dif-
ference between’ them.”
However, the public may be
waking up, and that could make
a difference.

Wallace got shot for arousing
us to our danger. You will not
get shot if you begin to write
your congressmen and the
President. Don't stop with
voting - make your voice heard.

I would suggest that every
student and professor in this
college write to President
Nixon, in your own words, and
ask him this: ‘‘You declared a
state of emergency on August
15th, 1971, fourteen months ago.
That gave you dictatorial
powers. The. emergencies have
passed. When will you
relinquish those powers?"

We get filled with trash like
Watergate, and are led away
from the real issues. We are
becoming a Socialist dic-
tatorship.

It is encouraging that Prof. E.
F. Patterson has come out for
Rennie Davis, Ralph Aber-
nathy, William Kunstler and
McGovern. In 1968, before the
present student body came to
Davidson, Prof. Patterson was
straining every nerve and fibre
rooting for that politically ex-
tinct Pied Piper poet. Eugene
McCarthy.

I think he has picked the
wrong horse again, in “‘let the
commies have it'’ McGovern. I
find it possible to hope so.

The extent of McGovern's
belief that college students are
utterly stupid and incredibly
naive is illustrated by quoting
from a speech he made to
students at the University of
Wisconsin on Friday evening,
March 5th, 1971.

Cravenly kissing the (shall
we say) feet of these young
people he said **No one under 30
can be drafted" and “In all
American combat operations,
each member of Congress and
each member of the President's
National Security Council and
joint Chief's of Staff shall
devote a period of time to front-
line combat duty.”

Proof of the above assinine
and boot-licking statements will
be sent by me on request.

Yak".

By midnight you feel the rack

tighten, but first a flick about
Mercutio, a friar, a sai] and
two kids in love. Even happy
hours seem long by the time you
finally catch winks after 4:00
a.m. A sophomore sleeps on the
floor in the middle of your
room.
Saturday comes so quickly
that taking a hot shower at noon
leaves you dizzy. You stagger
over to the stadium with your
date but find it difficult to see
the stands for the alumni.

While hunting a seat you
notice that the day is overcast
like somebody sat on the sun,
and rather than purge itself
with a few honest drops of rain
the mist just clings to you like
wet kleenex.

Before the kickoff you leave
your date under an umbrella
and go down to the field. There
you form two lines with the
other freshmen through which
the football team runs,
growling. Seeing this the
shelves of people leap to their
feet cheering, and the game
begins.

Davidson wins this time, and
the only losers are 13 girls at
halftime. There are 10 nice girls,
two pretty ones, and the winner,
Miss Queen Bee, and she is a
real loser. Only Hattie is truly

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

worthy.

Saturday night your big time
means waiting for a group two
hours late only to find out how
bad they are, but otherwise it is
like the night before except the
“‘goodnight"’ comes two hours
earlier.

Sunday morning the room is a
minefield of clothes and dead
bodies. The sophomore in the
middle of the room has an arm —
hanging out of the sheets like a
trip wire, and after stepping on
it once without any response
you realize that he is no longer
alive.

The electric razor sounds too
much like a fire drill to use this
morning so you take your date
to church with a rough, lean
look on your face.

Here Will Terry preaches a
sermon on sex, and you know
your date is really impressed
later on by the way she sits
thoughtfully over a lunch of
roast beef and milk.

All the way back to the
Charlotte bus station you begin
to think about those reviews
waiting for you on Monday. She
leaves as she came, and in a few
seconds the diesel zoo fades out
of sight and sound into nothing
more than a memory and all the
way back to Davidson you won-
der if that sophomore corpse is
still lying there in the middle of
your room.

Holshouser, Beatty
Get Student Praise

To the Editor;

There are a few things which
I believe the faculty and
especially the students at-
tending Davidson from North
Carolina should be aware of
concerning the gubernatorial
race.

Despite the fact that Bowles
has spent more than $1 million,
Holshouser has closed the gap
in the polls on an average of 2.5
percent every two weeks for the
last two months. Until now
Jim's campaign has spent
about $160,000.

Hargrove Bowles says he's
opposed to new taxes. So is
Holshouser. Yet Bowles has
voted for every single tax in-
crease to come before the
General Assembly since he's
been in it.

Jim Holshouser knows the
budget process. He's served
four terms on the House Ap-
propriations Committee and
three terms on the Joint House-
Senate Appropriations Sub-
committee.

After 72 years of the political
machine and one party
domination, it's time for a
change. Holshouser.is the man

‘we've all been waiting for to

give us that change. Jim
graduated from Davidson in
1956.

I hope as many of you as
possible can meet him and talk
to him and consider voting for
him in November. It's your
vote. Use it to send Holshouser
to Raleigh, for yourself and for
the state.

To the Editor:

Davidson students have a
rare chance this year to work in
a meaningful local political
campaign. It is quite unusual

for a progressive Democrat like
State Rep. Jim Beatty to have a
good chance for election to
Congress from North Carolina,
so I am hoping that a number of
students, regardless of their
permanent residence or past
political experience, will join in
the campaign to elect Jim Beat-
ty to the U.S.- House of
Representatives.

In 1971, when the legislature
ratified the Twenty-Sixth
Amendment, more than fifty
legislators had joined the
movement for the 18 year-old
vote, but only 4 of those men
could claim a 6 year record of
fighting for this extension of the
franchise. Jim Beatty was one
of these men.

&

Jim has worked for a new
system of drug abuse laws. In
1971, he sponsored the bills
which provided for (1) more
lenient penalties for the
possession of marijuana and (2)
a drug abuse education
program within the Depart-
ment of Public Instruction.

Finally, Jim has, as chair-
man of the N.C. House Ap-
propriations Education sub-
committee, worked diligently
for a higher quality of education
for North Carolina’s
schoolchildren. He refuses to
give in, as does his conservative
Republican opponent, to the
racist cries for an anti-busing
amendment to the Constitution.
but rather works for an
equitable system of public

education for all North
Carolinians.
Please consider this op-

portunity to do something for

Mecklenburg County. North
Carolina and the country.
