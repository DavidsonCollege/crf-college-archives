The Alpha chapter ‘of the Sigma Pi
Sigma at its fall ceremony last Monday
night initiated W. P. Creech and J. G.
Willis into membership. These men for
two years or, more have shown consid-
erable interest and made excellent grades
in Physics.

It is well known all
thinkers that science moves forward rap-
idly and itis difficult for one in his chosen
field to keep pace with the development.
Sigma Pi Sigma, in bringing together
faculty and students, not only encourages
research; but those

of students of common interests have de-

are our inheritance today. The growth

cess. In the thirty-eight chapters scat-
tered over the United States and into
the Philippines one finds a group of

students and faculty meeting in a com-
mon cause to report on things that have
impressed them concerning recent de-
velopments. i

Sigma Pi Sigma as a national organi-
zation has recently received more recog-
nition in initiating as honorary mem-
bers most of the outstanding physicists
of our country and several from the
European countries. The most recent
honorary members are: Dr. J. W. Beams,
of the University of Virginia, and Dr.
G. W. Stewart, of the University of
Iowa. Dr. Beams was a National Re
search Fellow for four years and served
research director at Yale Univer-
sity and is now Professor of Research
at the University of Virginia. Dr.
Beams with his electron and guns, to-
gether with his ultra-centrifuge
attracted much attention in the field of
Physics. Dr. Stewart is an author and
outstanding scholar and has been recog-

as

has

nized and honored hy all the Physical so-
cieties of America. Rather recently Sig-
ma’Pi Sigma was accepted as a member
of the Institute of Physics. This in-
stitute consists of all the scientific or-
ganizations of America.

Two outstanding things resulted from
the third national convention recently
held at Purdue University. These

‘he delegation and the officials felt that
the spirit of science through the ages
has been that of giving to the public
its findings without any reservations. So,
in order that Sigma Pi Sigma may be
in step with this spirit it too, makes
known and form of
ritual.

Sigma Pi Sigma publishes twice a year
a magazine which contains the recards
and reports of interest from the different
chapters. On the cover of one of these
magazines is a picture of Chambers

versity; the Alpha-Gamma chapter «at

Delta chapter at the University of Den-

vention states that several chapters will
