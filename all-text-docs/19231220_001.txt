Thoughtful Address at Vesper
Service

ABUNDANT LIFE IS THEME

Thought-Inspiring Address Heard
by Large Audience
“Tam come that they might have life,
and have it more abundantly,” was the
text upon which Rev. W. B. McIlwaine,
of Charlotte, based his remarks in speak-
ing before the Y. M. C. A. Sunday even-
ing.

During his talk the speaker stressed
the latter part his text, “More
abundantly.” He began by giving two
beautiful illustrations which brought out
the difference between life and more
abundant life.

“In the Pennsylvania mountains is a
small stream which supplies the water-
supply for a nearby town. But when the.
water was low, the stream became, only
a thread, and the town was threatened
with a water famine. They had some
water, but not enough, and could con-
sume the water only at stated intervals
during the day. Water not |
abundant. |

“A little higher in the mountains was |
another stream which was a continual
fountain, which bubbled up in all kinds
of weather. The town which this stream

Galpanios: Stina Namber
Piedmont Lyceum Course

Mr. and Mrs. <Galyano Perform on’
Harp and Steel Guitar—Mrs.
Galgano’s Readings Please
Audience -

The second entertainment of the Piedmont
Lyceum Course was presented in Shearer |
Hall on Friday night, December 14th, when |
Mr. and Mrs. Galgano gave a musical pro- |
gram, Mr. Galgano playing on the harp and |
Mrs. Galgano on the steel guitar. The Gal- |
ganos were heard by students and towns- |
people in an audience which although it was
small because of an unavoidable conflict with |
the Davidson-Washington and Lee debate,
was, nevertheless, an appreciative and en-
thusiastic one. |

The Galganos began their program with |
two duets on the harp and steel guitar. The
first of these was the “Barcarole” from T, ales |
of Hoffman, and O Sole Mio followed. The
blending of these two instruments as played|
by Mr. and Mrs, Galgano produced a most |
pleasing musical effect. A Hawaiian inter-:
pretation of the Rosary was given next by!
Mrs. Galgano on the steel guitar. As an en-|
core, Schumann's Traumerie was played.

Mr. Galgano, in a series of harp solos
which followed, displayed a remarkable mas-
tery of his instrument and perfect technique. |
The first three of the solos were Harp|
Rhapsody, La Paloma and Mother Maeree.
In response to the enthusiastic hand-clapping
of the audience, Mr. Galgano played two!
pieces as encores, one of which was a foot-
provoking jig called Whistling Rufus.

This part of the program was followed by
several entertaining readings given by Mrs. |
Galgano, which were appreciated by the au-|
dience. Mr. Galgano continued his} program |
on the harp with the following pieces : Grand |
Concert Watls, Annie Laurie, Mocking Bird, |
Happy Hours in Coon-Town, Dixie and
Turkey in the Straw. The pleasing and}
varied program of the evening was con-|

cluded with two duets, Love’s’ Old Sweet |
Song and Southern Melodies arranged by
Foster.

Davidson Debating Team Wins Annual Debate With
Washington and Lee By Three to Two Decision

Hollingsworth and Stith Win Hard-Fought Contest From Masinter and Lowry of Virginia Institution—
Immigration Problem Discussed From Every Angle by Speakers—Overflowing Audience Hears Well-

Davidson College won its annual for-
ensic encounter with Washington and
Lee University Shearer Hall, Friday
night, December 14th, and by the three
to two decision of the judges success-
fully upheld the negative of the query
Resolved: That the present Immigration
Law should be re-enacted. M. C. Smith
and A, H. Hollingsworth, Jr., brought
new honor to Davidson by evening the
count with the Virginia institution which
iast year out-debated the Wildcats. Both
men presented able arguments and made
a very interesting contest which the
close decision warrants. For Washing-
ton and Lee, Ralph Masinter and Charles
W. Lowry, Jr., held up again the worthy

in

| record of the Generals and went down to

an honorable defeat only by the closest
of decisions.

Opening the argument for the affirma-
tive, Masinter reviewed the progress of
immigration into the United States and
outlined the meaning of the present im-
migration law, passed in 1921 and to go

|out of effect in 1924, which states that

not more than three per cent of the
nationals of any country residing in the

present law unsatisfactory

Worked-Out Argument

permitted to enter the United States
each year,

The two main arguments advanced by
Masinter that the negative could
not without serious fallacy in their
reasoning argue total restriction of
immigration nor the
policy. So the affirmative
that some restriction
was necessary to the economic, political,
and social welfare of the nation and the
theoretical soundness of the present law
and its practicable solution of this prob-
lem was left to the
the affirmative to prove.

Stith, speaking first Davidson,
agreed with the affirmative that neither
total restriction the
policy was best, but pointed out that the
negative would attempt to prove the
and to pre-
sent a better law for solving this vexing
problem, The present law is too elastic,
he said, allowing too many immigrants
of the Balkin type with their lower code
of morals and social and political ideals
and allowing too few of the Anglo-Saxon
and North European types.~ Then the

subjected to any test by our government
before they The main objection
to the stand of the affirmative was that
this law is not selective as regards qual-
ity and method of choosing.

C. W. Lowry, Jr., continued the argu-
ments of the affirmative with two poings.
The law is theoretically sound
as it co-operates with all the past laws

undesirable and unassimable aliens. It
has been he claimed, fair to the United
States and fair to the aliens themselves.
It is based upon the principles of equity,
justice, and righteousness. The law was
thus also claimed to be flexible and selec-
tive by the arguments of the affirmative.

Closing the negative side, A. H. Hol-
ingsworth outlined the new plan of the
negative. It would limit the immigrants
to two per cent based on the 1890 cen-
sus, and this would automatically cut
down upon the numbers from the south
European countries and raise the num-
bers from .the Nordic nations. <A fur-
