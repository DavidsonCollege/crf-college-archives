Students, townspeople walk to fight hunger in the Crop Wa

By Jeff Fuller
For most Americans, not hav-
ing enough food is hardly ever a
concern. Davidson students most
likely have their meals at Vail
Commons or their houses without

thinking of what it must be like to
live in a country where hunger is a
definite problem. | However,
Davidson does have several op-
portunities for students to learn
about and fight against hunger.

CROP, Christian Rural Over-
seas Program, holds CROP lunches
every second and fourth Wednes-
day of the month in the 900 room
from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The
meal usually consists ofcorn bread,
beans, and rice to symbolize a meal
one might be fortunate enough to
eat in a famine-stricken country.

The meal is accompanied by a
video or discussion, and students
are-encouraged to donate two to
three dollars. The next CROP lunch
will be held on October 13.

On October 10, CROP is hold-
ing a CROP walk beginning at the
Village Green, at the corner of
Concord and Main, at 1:30 p.m..
Money will be raised by partici-

pants who will solicit pledges.

Twenty-five percent of this
money will go to help Mecklen-
burg County, especially the Senior
Center which will receive a con-
siderable portion of that money.
The rest of the money will go to
needy nations like Bangladesh,
India, and Somalia, anda gift-pack-
age will be sent to Midwest flood
victims.

The first CROP walk was held
in Bismarck, North Dakota in 1969,
and sincethen the numbet of walks
has grown to about 1,800 per year
involving 3.17 million people as
participants and sponsors.

¢Please stay off the referees’
backs during flickerball games. We
have witnessed some awful treat-
ment and these people deserve bet-
ter. Remember that exceptforJudy,
these referees are students. Maybe
you should criticize yourself as a
player before criticizing others
around you. We would also like to
see more campus wide involve-
ment. For the season, there have
been way too many forfeits.

*This upcoming Saturday
there is the annual 100 inning soft-
ball game at Moore’s field in
Mooresville. The game starts at six

in the morning and runs until eight
that night. We hope that professors
and students come to play about
twenty:innings. We plan to con-

‘tinue the tradition and play the full

100 innings.

*Weespecially like the climb-
ing wall in Johnston gym. If you
haven’t gone you need to visit dur-
ing the hours of seven until nine,
Monday through Thursday. Go bug
Charlie Blake.

Some real random thoughts:
*Las Vegasv. Duke in 1991 NCAA
basketball championship was defi-
nitely a fix. No question.
eLennox Lewis should be fighting
Riddick Bowe before Evander
Holyfield gets his rematch.

courage Davidson College students
to participate in the CROP walk or
sponsor a participant. “I would
like to see us raise over $500 and
get over 100 students [to walk],”
she said, describing her goals for
this year’s walk.

She also hopes people will
realize that participating in the
CROP walk is a short time com-
mitment and “it’s really not that
hard.” People are also needed to
work rest stops during the walk. If
interested in participating in the
CROP walk as a walker you can
pickupsponsor formson the Union
Pit desk or from a CROP walk
recruiter.
