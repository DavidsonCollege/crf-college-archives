War Is Subject
Of Peace Week

A planning committee of
faculty, clergy and students
met twice this week in order
to organize plans for a series
of lectures, films, and free
discussions on the subject of
war.

The program, to be entitled
“Why War?" will be pre-
sented during a week-and.a-
half period in mid-November.
Exact dates are not certain,
but the presentations will co-
incide with the showing of the
movie, ‘The War Game,”
and the Reynolds Lecture by
wians Morganthau.

several students, Professor
Samuel Maloney, and Will
Terry, minister of the David-
son College Presbyterian
Church.

The ‘Why War?" commit.
tee has set three purposes
for the program. They hope
to raise the question of the
necessity of war, to discuss
the concepts of war in gen.
eral, and primarily to serve
the purpose of the students
who aren't sure how they
feel about war.

The group had originally
considered a special program
on the war in Vietnam. but
decided that such a’ presen
tation would limit discus
sions.

Some of the topics suggest
ed included the psychological
effects of war, draft and the
law, a world without war, al-
ternatives to war, ethical
problems raised by war, the
economics of war and peace,
and others.

At the present time, sup-
port for the program has
been obtained from the Col-
lege Union and the YMCA.
Other sources are being
sought for financial support.

The committee, which met
Tuesday and Thursday of
this week, decided against a
Suggestion for an anti-war
presentation, and also against
a pacifist slant in the pro-
gram. The program will of
fer, according to the commit-
tee, ‘facts from which stu-
dents may derive their own
conclusions about war.

War P

Draws

About 15 Davidson students
participated in the march
protesting the United States’
policy in Vietnam last Satur-
day in Washington. D. C.

The march, ostensibly a
peace march, led to a con-
frontation between protestors
and police at the Pentagon.
More than.400 people were
arrested and some were in-
jured, according to a pro-
fessional news service.

Junior John Pancake, one
of the students attending the
march, said that the march
“may have accomplished
something. It might well
make the  arcministration
think twice before getting
into a similar war."

Sophomore Jimmy Withrow
said he was ‘‘disappointed™
because he did not feel that
many of the people at the
march were sincere in their
purpose.

Senior Bob Dewell describ
ed the march as “amazing.”
He said that the administra
tion must have been affected
by “the fact that there was

He also said that “the ef-
fect of the march was lessen-
ed by the papers."’ The press
portrayed the demonstrators

s ‘‘just a bunch of hippies,”
Dewell said. The papers fo
cused on violence, although
there was very little. he add-
ed.

The crowd estimates given
in newspapers were incor
rect, according to Dewell,
Pancake and Withrow, who
estimated the crowd at about
100,000. This was. in con-
trast. to estimates by the
press of about 30,000 to 50.
000 and to predictions by the
organizers of the march of
about 200,000.

Withrow stated that ‘there

Group Sets
Regular
Peace Vigil

Plans are underway for
forming a Davidson peace
vigil, patterned after similar
vigils at Duke and UNC, to
protest the war in Vietnam.

“The purpose of the peace
vigil is to enable people to
make some public form of
protest against the actions
of our government in Viet-
nam,’ said John Pancake,
spokesman for an impromptu
local peace group.

A preliminary vigil was
held Tuesday afternoon on the
baseball field. About a dozen
students attended.

Vigils will probably be
held regularly each Wednes-
day at chapel period. The
vigils will be silent.

Five other cities in North
Cerolina have had peace
vigils. One is held in front
of the Charlotte Post Office
each Wednesday at noon.
Winston Salem, Greensboro.
Durham and Chapel Hill also
have vigils.

“One of the reasons for
having a vigil at Davidson is
that it is. difficult to attend
vigils in Charlotte. and more
vigils wil! be more effect-
ive,”’’ Pancake said.

were generally three classes
of people at the march: the
hippies, the intellectuals and
the observers."’ Trouble.
makers came from each
group.

He described the intellect.
uals as the ones who “after
reading about the conflict de-
cided that the cause (the
peace march) really was
worthwhile."*

Pancake described the pro-
testers as a ‘diverse group
of people’’' and said that
“most of them were pretty
fesponsible."'

Withrow said that the part

of the march which occurred
before the crowd reached the
Pentagon was fairly peace-
ful, and that after reaching
the Pentagon, the march
turned into ‘‘a mass rally
where emotionalism takes
prerogative over reason.’’ He
added that when the pro
testors reached the Penta-
gon, many of them went ‘‘be-
serk" and tried to storm it.

Policemen and __ soldiers
surrounded the Pentagon and
were stationed about 15 feet
apart, Dewell said. “Reserves
were available to reinforce
trouble spots.

Final Report Soon

Dean of the Faculty Fron-
tis Johnston announced yes
terday that the Blue Sky
Committe will present its
final report to the faculty at
a special meeting on Nov. 15.

Faculty members will re-
ceive a copy of the commit
tee’s report welt ahead of
this date, according to a brief
statement issued to THE
DAVIDSONIAN.

Johnston added that an
open meeting will be held in
the College Union before the
Nov. 15 meeting for discuss-
ion of the comm.ttee’s pro
posals.

Johnston. who is acting as
chairman of the Blue Sky
Committee, emphasized, ‘‘A.
doption of this program, if it
is adopted. does not mean
that it will be totally imple-
mented next year. lt remains
to be seen what resources will
be available.”

Faculty approval on Nov.
15 will be only the first step
in making the Blue Sky cur.
riculum a réality. he said.
Resources for the program
and approval of the Board
of Trustees must also be se-
cured.

Johnston stated that he
hoped to know “‘by Thanks.
giving’’ what resources would
be available for 1968 to insti-
tute the program, at least in
part.

He said the Board of Trus
tes had expressed a willing
ness to meet in special ses
sion to hear the faculty's
recommendations on the pro
gram, if such recommenda
tions are forthcoming on Nov.
15.

If final approval is secur-
ed, the provisions of the pro
gram will be put into effect
“as resources become avail
able,"’ Johnston concluded.

The provisions contained in
the Biue Sky Committee's
preliminary report issued
last spring include a three
semester academic calendar,
the end of compulsory ROTC,

dents of exceptional ability.

Indian Scholar
Finally Arrives

After a delay of over a
month, Luigi Carlo Simonelli,
Richardson Scholar from In-
dia, has arrived at Davidson.

Simonelli was delayed in
his trip to the United States
because of financial prob-
lems involving the Indian
government. According to
him, India does not allow
Students to leave the country
for foreign education in
courses which can be taken
in India.

“Since [ was trying to
leave. in order to study the
courses I am taking, 1 found

it difficult to obtain the
necessary finances,"’ Simon
eli said.

An uncle who lives in Lon
don helped him solve his
problems. This uncle was
able to obtain financia! sup-
port from his bank and thus

Board To Decide Status
Of Literary Magazine

Proposed changes in the
status of The Miscellany and
the Wildcat Handbook will
be decided at a Monday
meeting of the Publications
Board during chape! period
in the Business Office.

The creation of a photogra
phy board to supervise the
publications’ darkroom will
also be considered. said Sam
Boyte, board chairman,

Wednesday the Student
Council submitted . to the
board a resolution calling for

changes designed to ensure
that the. handbook would be
completed in time to be sent
to incoming freshmen during
the summer and to ensure
that 4ll important informa.
tion is included.

Boyte said that it was like-
ly that the board would ap.
prove the request of The Mis-
cellany to rejoin the Publica
tions Board. The Miscellany
pulled out of the board last
year in order to gain more
internal control for its Board
of Advisers.
