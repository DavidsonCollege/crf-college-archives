“T think about the near future, say
up to 2 years down the road. I don’t
see myself married, with a house, or
anything like that yet.” ~

“The future is a topic that is obvi-
ously avoided among seniors. It is
conspicuously absent in conversa-

tion. No one wants to talk about it _

because they're afraid. What if I get
out and can’t find a job? Isn’t that a
fear with you?”

“This is a lot harder than coming
out of high school--there are a lot
more options. Too many.”

“You know. that you'll be some-
where next year. You're not going to
be in a desert. If you don’t like what

you’re doing you can quit.
There’s always something.”

“I haven’t heard anyone say -

that they are going toliveat home.
I’m going to Kansas to live with
my brother-to live off my
brother!”

“I’m hearing that there are a lot
of here. They talk as if ‘real life’ is
something not to be looked for-
ward to.”

* “I'm going to. take a year Off

before graduate school and do
something.”
. “Maybe I'll start a commune.”
“I took the GREinsummer, and
the NTE. I will take the GMAT
and the MAT this fall, so thatI will
have lots of options. I’m getting
my teaching certificate this

spring, and I want to travel
around the country this summer.
Then I want to teach for 1-2
years...or go to graduate
school...or I don’t know!”

Many people I spoke with have
applied for scholarships, or are in
the process of preparing for GREs
and LSATs.

Most seniors are discovering
the Careers; Office, some have
resumes finished, and a few are
interviewing and actively pursu-
ing certain jobs.

When lasked one senior where
he is in his search he said: “Well, I
did have anappointment with the
Careers Office, but the hurricane
blew it away.” I think he meant
the appointment.

Photography review

Scott's scenes
of the South

By PAUL BERRINGER

The colorful photography of Anderson Scott pro-
vides an interesting if not mentally challenging dis-
play in the College Union. Scott, a 1984 Davidson
graduate, never took a studio art course here, but he
did study at the School of Photography at Yale Univer-
sity, where he subsequently was rewarded his M.F.A.

While at Yale, Scott increased his knowledge of the
technical aspects in photography and learned how to
photograph in varied conditions.

The school was founded by Walker Evans, whoim-
bued the department with his artistic philosophy.
While Scott had begun working in theconceptual vein
of such nature photographers as Ansel Adams and
Eliot Porter, as he considered their formalist approach
to natural subject matter interesting, he came to find
Evans's sophistication more appealing.

Whereas Evans worked in black and white, Scott
works in color, and he. finds that this use of color
provides him with a new avenue to explore Evans's
philosophy. While Scott continues to be interested in

the basic geometry of form, reminiscent of Adamsand

Porter, the intensely southern quality of his work is
strongly suggestive of the later influence of Evans.

Scott photographs almost entirely in the South.He
finds the North less appealing aesthetically, and he
states that, because he often trespasses, he finds north-
erners more intimidating and threatening. ..

Scott’s southern subjects are frequently of lower- to
middle-class origins, yet not bereft of dignity. The
photographs of rustic southern sites reflect a visual
interest in the bizarre and a conceptual interest in
abstraction. More importantly, thematically these
photographs display a dignity similar to that foundin
his portrait work, which serves to remind one of the
South's tremendous beauty and its pride and pathos.

Fall means many different
things to many people. The
leaves are falling, the kids are
back in school and the newest
fall fashions are on the racks.

Each year the fashions are a
little different, maybe a little
more interesting. And_ this
year’s fall fashions look like
they won’t disappoint us on
either count.

The most. conspicuou
change from. previous years is
the reappearance of animal
prints. Once considered.a relic
from the ‘60s, the animal print

isshowing up everywhere

from the runways of Milan to
the local department store.

However, opinions on the
infamous print vary from store
tostore. April Morgan, a Belk’s
Stores associate, declared the
print “very hot.” .

“In our Serenade to Autumn
fashion show Adrienne Vitta-

_ dini(theguest designer) worea

leopard print outfit that every-
body now wants,” she said.

The prints are not contained to
just clothing either. According
to Morgan, “They run. the

whole gamut from purses and °

belts to earrings and shoes.” -
However, this predomi-
nance of prints doesn’t exist in
some other stores.
Hattie Massey, an associate

at Thalhimers’, noted only one:

print jacket among the entire
better sportswear collection.

Instead she noted herringbone —

and tweed were among the
preferred fabrics.
“The conservative and ex-

ecutive look is very popular.

Jones of New York (a sports-
wear manufacturer) produces
a lot of very popular two-piece
suits that are selling quite
well.”

~_ However, the “leopard look”
is no longer that popular--”We

had more during summer in
the safari motif butnot for fall,”
said Massey. A Limited associ-
ate, Allison Huffman, agreed,
“We dida lot for spring, but not
right now.”

Davidson reaction to the

. prints is varied. Sophomores

Jill Mathis andCarmen Dock-
ery expressed horror at the
idea. Said Mathis, “] think they
belong back in the jungle.”
Dockery, believes they should
be used for a_ better
purpose—"They belong on
dogs’ sweaters,” she said.

“Ithink they’re too kinky to
wear in the daytime,” echoed
senior Molly Young. However,
sophomore Heath Hardage
said, “I think a leopard mini-
skirt could enhance your social
life considerably.”

Besides the prints, there are
many other hallmarks to look
for in fall fashion. In addition to
prints, Belk’s Morgan has no-

ticed other tendencies.

“The clothes are going more
towards the Edwardian look,”
she stated. “Also, the Chanel-
type clothes are very popular.”

According to Limited’s
Huffman, “The tapestry vests
are a very big item this year.”
Other worthy items to note are
the “bubble” sweater worn
over tights and the predomi-
nance of suede in many outfits.

So, obviously, the women do
have a choice. One Davidson
woman, sophomore Liz
Murphy, just doesn’t worry
about fashion trends. “I don’t
shop actively,” she said, “my
boyfriendin Beverly Hills does
that for me.”

The guys’ opinionsare alittle —
simpler about all of this.

According tofreshman Matt
Dormer, “I like the mini-
skirts.” Sophomore Mike Mal-
loy answered unabashedly, “I
haven't even noticed.”
