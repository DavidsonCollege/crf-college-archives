~“BUCK” CURRIE SPEAKS
IN SPRING SERIES OF
SERVIGES HELD BY “Y”

Rev. A. L. Currie Delivers Six
Speeches From Tuesday
To Thursday

PREACHES AT VESPERS

Story of Nicodemus Given in
Dramatic Monologue

Rev, A. L. “Buck” Currie
completed his set of spring
services for the Y. M. C. A.
Thursday evening, March 18,
with an address on the subject
“The Lights of the World.”
That morning he had given a
dramatic monologue, present-
ing the story of Nicodemus;
and the evening before, he had
told “How We May Keep Our
Hearts.”

Throughout the entire series of
six seryices, morning and evening
from Tuesday through Thursday
of last week, Mr Currie tried to
show the student body how to live,
using as his pattern that master
of living, Jesus Christ.

Wednesday evening the speaker
showed that Christ shad always
been able to keep His heart through
all the temptations He had to en-
dure on this earth. Christ never
weakened. This was due, said Mr.
Currie, to two things, In the first
place, Christ never forgot that God
made all things, no matter how bad
they seemed, to work together for
good. He remembered that God
made “evils to become angels.”

Secondly, Christ was careful to
cultivate religious habits. He nev-
er “broke” His training for Chris-
tianity. Among the religious habits
of Christ were prayer, regular Bible
reading and study, and faithful
church attendance. In conclusion
Mr. Currie said: “The men who
crack are those who haven't kept
their souls in shape.”

By using the form of the dra-
matic ‘monologue and by filling in
missing parts of the story with his
imagination, Mr. Currie tried Thurs-
day morning to throw light upon
the story of the spiritual develop-
ment of Nicodemtis. This man, at
first an uninterested Pharisee, first
came to Jesus by night to learn
of His teachings. After a time he
was converted in his mind and
heart, but his faith was not strong
enough to lead him to risk his
standing among the Jews by an-

NUOGIAN TELLS
DF REVOLUTION

Countess Tolstoy, Daughter of
Author, Talks on Soviet

Regime
Countess * Alexandra Tolstoy,
daughter of the famous Russian

novelist, Count Leo Tolstoy, ad-
dressed one of the largest audiences
ever to attend a lecture in Cham-
bers auditorium last Monday eve-
ning. Countess Tolstoy chose as
her subject “Tolstoy and the Rus-
sian Revolution.”

The Countess began her lecture
by answering a question. which is
in many Russian hearts: “What
would Count Leo Tolstoy say about
the present Russian Government?”
Countess Tolstoy stated that she
firmly believed her father would
oppose the Soviet government. She
gave as her chief proof her fath-
er’s article on capital punishment
“T Cannot Decide.” In this article
Count Tolstoy gave his views on
several of the present problems.

Countess Tolstoy devoted the
main part of her speech in describ-
ing Russia as it was when she left
in 1921. She told many interesting
stories concerning the type of edu-
cation which existed at that time.
Before Countess Tolstoy came to
America she ran a private school
in Russia. The government forced
her to graduate peasant students re-
gardless of their ability and learn-
ing because they wanted their lead-
ers to be from the working class.
She stated that 25 per cent of the
students’ time had to be given to
military, training. She also stated
that a person who did not belong
to the “great union” could not get
a job and that if one was dismissed
from the union starvation was their
only alternative.

At the close of her lecture Coun-
tess Tolstoy gave the audience her
idea of Stalin. She feels that Stal-
in’s promises of better home life,
strict devorces, secret ballots, etc.,
are promises and nothing more.

Dr. Gwynn Serves On
Religious Committee

Dr. Price H. Gwynn, professor
of education, was in New York City
Friday and Saturday of last week,
serving as a member of the Fellow-
ship Committee of the Natiortal
Council on Religion in Higher Edu-
cation.

This committee awards  fellow-
ships for American and foreign
graduate study in fields of liberal
art to men who will later serve in
undergraduate institutions. A first
requirement for every applicant is
that he be deeply, interested in re-
ligion, so that, no matter what sub-
ject he may teach, his influence
may be in the cause of religion.

One of the five men chosen for
a fellowship was William Armis-
tead Christian, of the class of 1926
