Me And My All-American Family

By RUSS MERRITT
Editor-in-Chief

I am the eldest son of the
third place All - American
family, the second runner-
up in the All-American Fami-
ly Contest.

There you have it. My own
personal, deep dark secret,
confessed to the Davidson
public only out of journalis-
tic integrity, need for copy
and much arm-twisting by
my fellow editor.

Actually, the whole All
American Family experience
was not that bad. In fact,
there were some very good
moments, some very good
people, some very good en-
counters involved in the 12-
day pageant.

According to one official,
the contest, which has
been successfully establish-
ed for several years, attracts
over 10,000 family  appli-
cants across the country
each year.

The program,
“The All - American Family
Search,’ is managed by the
All - American Family In-
stitute (apparently a group
of rich Miami Hebrew-Amer-
icans) and is operated along
lines very similar to the Miss
America contest. Only we
didn't have bathing suit com-
petition.

Lehigh Acres, a retirement
community just outside Fort
Myers in Florida, serves as
host for the family pageant
for the same reason that At-
lantic City keeps the bath-
ing beauties — publicity,
which can easily be translat-
ed into money.

For the first time, the
pageant was televised this
year, with most ABC stations
across the country
up the festivities and mak-
ing the 90-minute finals
available to 86 per cent of
the nation’s TV viewers. This
was, from my perspective,
most regrettable. It has
never been my drean? to be
seen dancing with the Cow-
sills.

Neither, though, were the
actual happenings of the
event. I was pleasantly sur-
prised upon our arrival there
(after driving through four
states in a car with a bright
sign advertising us as ‘‘Vir-
ginia’'s All-American Fami-
ly’) to find 20 or 30 kids as
horrified by their presence
and participation in the pa-
geant as I was. An instant
camaraderie was formed, a
sort of fellowship of martyrs,
and the environs became
somewhat more tolerable.

The competition started al-

entitled

picking |

most immediately. Photo-
graphers met every family
as it drove into the parking
lot of the Country Club Mo-
tel, where all 51 (District of
Columbia included) families
were housed.

As we registered, officials
and judges sat back in their
chairs, smiling nicely and
noting such tangibles as hair
length, family bickering, etc.

Approximately 539 inter-
views with each family soon
followed, as the representa-
tives of all 51 areas were
paraded before a long list
of famous (Dr. Joyce Broth-
ers, for example) and not-
so-famous judges.

Each family was
tested as to its unity,
eration, community
ment, individual achieve-
ments, and ‘‘that unique
quality and spark which dis-
tinguishes great families
from the very good families.”

Besides the interviews, the
families were also judged on
their amiability and congen-
iality with the other partici-
pants in the contest, the cook-
ing of each individual mother
(in ‘“‘the world’s greatest
family meal,:') and general
participation and _personali-
ty demonstrated ‘during the
pageant.

Talent was also a part of
the pageant, if not the judg-
ing. Since participation in the
talent show was _ strongly
suggested, most mothers
climbed onto the stage to
sing the likes of ‘Some-

subtly
coop-
involve-

where’ and ‘“‘The Sound of
Music.”

This made for tedious
entertainment, since most

hadn't sung since the Junior
Choristers back in Sunday
School.

The Massachusetts father
(everyone was known by his
state and his position in the
family) won first in talent
with his impassioned ver-
sion of ‘Impossible Dream.”

Personally, I thought the
best entertainment of the
night came when the son of
the South Carolina family
rode his unicycle over the
emcee and off the side of
the stage into the audience,
quite by accident.

The meals were very good:
the preparation for the meals
was not. Not a single meal
went by without the 51 fam-
ilies rising en masse to re-
cite the pledge to the Amer-
ican flag.

By lunch of the first day
I had tired of such recita-
tions; and even the military
families were slurring the
lines as the pageant drew to

AN ALL-AMERICAN BOY. . .

a close.

The pageant officials did
their best to fill every day
with something fun and ex-

citing, without much = suc
cess. Forums’ on_ drugs
and sex, square. dancing,

and listening to the Cow-
sills grows monotonous after
awhile.

So, the 2l-and-under set
made our own entertainment,
consisting of the usual fun
sought out by bored and des-
perate ‘‘youth,”” as we were
labelled. Because steady
boy and girl friends were
far behind, new and exciting
relationships were formed.

Several kids quite naive
to the ‘‘ways of the world,”
(after all, they were mem-
bers of All-American fami-
lies), were initially shocked
by their peers, but soon
joined the games with the
rest of the crowd. In time.
the games got to be so mo-
notonous that I longed for
more forums on drugs and
sex.

By the time that the final
night rolled around, when
the TV's. started grinding
and the various winners were
announced, every participant
in the contest was _ shot,
nerves were on edge, and
cool heads were rare.

One family. realizing it
had no chance to take any of
the marbles, read a protest
statement at the final meal
before the contest. Another
followed by presenting a
statement praising the whole

pageant.

The show started with an
introduction of the 51 fami
lies done by the two emcees,
Peter Marshall of ‘‘Holly-
wood Squares’ fame and
Anita Bryant of Florida sun-
shine notoriety.

Then the crowd got tense
as Marshall turned to the il
families, all crushed _ to-
gether on three high school
bleachers, and announced
“the family that you your-
selves have picked, the Most
Popular Family. from Roan-
oke, Virginia, the William
Merritts."’

Embarrassment was as
much in order as gratitude.
so I hid from the cameras
as we accepted the coveted
trophy.

Unfortunately, I couldn't
hide minutes later when all
the members of the ‘‘youth’’
had to dance on stage with
that All-American family of
rock, the Cowsills. Cameras
followed my every move as I
ducked, turned, and ran from
“You On My Mind.”

The worst was vet to
come, though. It was only a
few seconds later when An-
ita, after singing “Do, a
Deer’ with all children. an-
nounced that among the
eight semifinalists was the
Virginia All-American fami-
lv.

As I stood there alone on
this?) and finally to exam-

the other seven lucky win-
ners, I glanced at the length
of my brother’s hair, and
smiled as I assured myself
that we didn’t have to go any
farther in the farce.

And indeed, as the first

four finalists were named
with baited breath, T almost
cheered, until iweet Anita

concluded, ‘‘And !ast, but not
least, the Merritt family
from Virginia.’ I was in a
state of disbelief and panic
as the five families were led.
from the stage into a sound-
proof booth, which until that
night had been a men’s bath-
room.

Following another orange
juice commercial ‘by Anita.
we were led back onstage
again one by one to answer
the question, “If you could
advise President Nixon on
any one thing. what would
you tell him?”

The family from Oklahoma
won the pageant then = and
there. when the father said
he’d tell Nixon to get out
of Vietnam as honorably as
possible. For our part, I
mumbled something about
economic manifestations.

So, we finished only third
in the contest, second runner-
up to the winners from Okla-
homa (and Muskogee at
that). But all wasn't lost.
After all. I was first run-
ner-up in the vote of all
the kids for ‘‘All-Ameri-
can Boy"

Pinkerton Men Guard
At College Registration

To college and university
administrators, student reg-
istrations are more of a con-
cern than young voter regis-
trations, despite the vast
amount of
the latter.

For the coming week to
ten days. local educational
administrators are confront-
ed with a serious security
challenge borne out of a se-
ries of 24-hour days of con-
trolled confusion mixed with
uncontrolled emotions as old
and new students swarm over
their campuses.

Add to this is the fact that
most registrants are carry-
ing tuition money, either in
cash or negotiable notes, and
the situation is potentially
volatile.

It is not unusual for a large
university's receipts to total
sizeable sums for tuition, ac-
tivity fees, text books, and
such incidentals as locker
rentals, student union fees,
and so on.

The registration fees desk
is usually the last desk in
the registration hall. It has
been Pinkerton's, Inc. expe-
rience that strategically post-
ed security guards, both male
and female, supported by
plainclothes personnel are an
effective security require-
ment.

“Students are quite apt to
set down a wallet, purse or
other valuables and wander

attention given

from it in the confu-
sion of registrations,’ Mr.
Willis, Vice President-Secur-
ity of the nation's oldest and
largest security firm said.
“It is our job to look after
their interests.

“While the main concern
and security challenge is
the amount of cash on hand
during registration,” Mr. Wil-
lis said, “Pinkerton’s guards
are trained to cope with such
other registration situations
as control of parking, main-
taining orderly registration
lines, first-aid, lost and found,
and general building security
and control.”

He said that guards were
on hand to provide student
guidance rather than _ per-
form traffic and or discip-
linary control. ‘‘A student's
first impressions of campus
security is vital to the long
term relationship,” he said.

“A little extra effort and
courtesy .on the part of the
security personnel during
registration is helpful and
condusive to student compli-
ance with the rules and reg-
ulations of the college or uni-
versity.”

Mr. Willis said that cam-
pus book stores present a
special security problem. Cit-
ing the small staff of most
text book ‘stores, the display
of books on counters and
shelves, and the high cost of
books ‘today all create a po-

away

tentially troublesome secur-
ity environment. In addition,
there is the ever present
threat of fire.

The Pinkerton’s executive
recommended that the most
successful deterrent is a prop-
er blend of guard and secur-
ity devices. ‘‘This is especial-
ly necessary during the reg-
istration period when students
are making their book pur-
chases for the coming term.”

Library theft and vandal-
ism also increase as the
school year begins. Mr. Wil-
lis mentioned that most cam-
plus libraries expect a cer-
tain amount of pilferage and
damage and have this struc-
tured into their budgets.
“However, the critical prob-
lem is the protection of ir-
replacable manuscripts, ref-
erence text books, and other
research documents.”

Modern electronic devices
have contributed significant-
ly to reducing library losses.
The Pinkerton’s executive re-
ferred to the use of electron-
ic transmitter bugs inserted
into book covers that are de-
tected electronically—‘bug-
ging the book,” you might
say.

Pinkerton’s, Inc. with head-
quarters in New York City
and offices in 95 cities
throughout the country has
Security contracts with hun-
dreds of schools of higher
learning.
