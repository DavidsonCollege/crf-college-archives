Last week THE DAVID-
SONIAN interviewed one of
Davidson's most loyal ad-
mirers — and by far her most
faithful sports fan — Oskee-
gan. His real name is Preston
Sloan — “Thass S-l-o-a-n.. .
Idn't it? I think ‘at's it...
Sump'm like ‘at.”

Oskeegan has attended ev-
ery athletic contest Davidson's
teams have played here for

the past thirty odd years. “I lem, and many of his student
don’ miss no game,” he says. “friends” felt that he could

the baseball team. “I use ta
with 'em," he mused.
“They give me a uniform —
red cap, pants — everything.”

Even before that, Oskeegan
was an outstanding. baseball
player in his own right. He
was shortstop for Negro teams
in Durham and Winston-Sa-

if given the chance. Unfortu-
nately, rules prohibiting Ne-
groes squelched his career,

Today Oskeegan is em-
ployed by Jackson Cleaners
— cleaning rugs after closing
time. We found him there last
Thursday.

KAPPA SIG MASCOT

“Oskeegan, how do you like
Davidson boys?”

“Fine boys,” he said. “Fine
boys.” He thought for a min-
ute.

“You Kappa Sig?” he asked.
“Why do you want to know
that, Oskeegan?”

“Kappa Sigs the best,” he
returned promptly. “I keep up
with the Kappa Sigs.”

“Why do you think they’re
the best?” we pressed.

“They been best for las’ 20
years. Yeah, an’ 35 years, too.”
“I'm a Kappa Sig,” he added as
an afterthought. He pointed
toward Oak Row and contin-
ued “See them old ‘houses?
Kappa Sigs use’ to be in that
one ‘ere. I was they mascot —
use’ to run get ’em cigarettes
and co-colas.”

out an’ shaved all my hair
off,” he chuckled shifting his
weight to the other worn-out
loafer. “They use’ to take you
up in the woods at Egg Rock:
“Yessuh.” He wouldn't tell us
anymore about his initiation.
“It was secret.” |

He told us how he got his
name, though. It was pretty
simple.

“Me’n some Kappa Sigs was
sittin’ up at the River under a
tree, jus’ smoking,” he said.
“When one of 'em turned and
said ‘We gotta give you a new
name.’ The other’n said ‘Le’s
call ’im Oskeegan.’ They sat
there for half hour trying to
figure out how to spell it, then
gave up and jus’ said ‘You be
Oskeegan."”’

This speech made him thirs-
ty and we bought him a
“Peps-cola.” He looked at us
for a few moments.

“¥"all drink beer?” he quer-
ied.

“Yeah.” .

“Uh. Oh.” Another pause.
“Tell you what. B’fore y’al! go
home .. . Le’s go up the road.”
We promised him we would,
then bade him goodbye and
started walking away.

“Hey.” We turned around.
“Y'all bring me some old
shirts, now, when you come.”

That’s Oskeegan.

Virginia to South Georgia with
350,000 kilowatts of electric
power.

The dam, which is presently
being constructed about ten
miles from Davidson, is a con-
crete and earth type structure
over 7,000 feet long. The max-
imum length of. the spillway
will be 465 feet with a height
of 130 feet.

Such a great quantity of
concrete is being used in the
dam, that if it were used in
another way, it would be
enough to build an eight-
lane highway to “Hattie’s.” .

Lake Norman will be. 33.6
miles long. It is being carved
out of farmland, residential
sections, and highways. Com-
mercial timber is removed,
then tractors clear away the
debris to be burned. The lake
will serve also as a reservoir
for Davidson, Mooresville, and
other small towns. The esti-
mated cost for the entire pro-
ject is between 60 and 65 mil-
lion dollars.

You're needed >< just as your father and grands
‘father were. It’s an obligation that a lot of qualified
college men have to meet...that of serving your coun-|
try, when and where you are needed.[

And the Air Force needa college-trained men aa’
officers. This is caused by the rapidly expanding tech
nology that goes with hypersonic air and space fligh
‘Your four years of college have equipped you to han-,
dle complex jobs. You have the potential to profit
from advanced training ..: then put it to work.”
There are several ways to become an officer:

First there is Air Force ROTC. Another program,
‘relatively new, is Officer Training School. Here the
Air Force commissions certain college graduates, both
‘men and women, after three months’ training. The’
navigator training program enables you to win a
flying rating and a commission. And, of course, there's
the Air Force Academy)

1 ‘An Air Force officer’s starting salary averages out
ito about what you could expect as a civilian. First
ithere’s your base pay. Then add on such things as
tax-free rations and quarters allowances, free medical!
and dental care, retirement provision, perhaps flight
spay, and 30 days’ vacation per year. It comes to an
‘attractive figure. One thing more. As an officer, you!
will become eligible for the Air Force Institute of
jTechnology. While on active duty many officers will
‘win graduate degrees at Air Force expense.’

_/ Why not contact your local Air-Force Recruiter:
Or write to Officer Career Information, Dept.
