By Greeks During Break

Fraternity Liaison Officer

day rumors that Davidson
had been notified that anv
local fraternity wil! lose ils
national charter if the col.

Covington said. “We have
had no official contact with
the representatives of the
fraternities as a group since
our meeting last May. We
have received no official no-
tice that any charter will be
withdrawn.”

College officials met with
représentatives of the nation.
al fraternities which main-
tain chapters on the campus
May .12 to discuss with them
the total affiliation plan
drawn up by the local chapter
presidents.

Covington said. ‘At that
time they agreed to submit

individual position reports to
the college which would out-
line their “concerns about the
affiliation program.

"We have received one of
the individual .reports from

national offices. The one re.”

sponse we have received was
specific in its concerns and
very helpful: we look forward

‘to receiving other responses

equally helpful.”

Under the affiliation plan
submitted by the fraternity
presidents at the direction of
the Interfraternity Council.
all freshmen would have a
chance to be affiliated with a
fraternity.

Two types of bids would be
offered by a fraternity to
freshmen. The first would of-
fer either traditional brother-
hood in the fraternity or so-
cial affiliation. The second
would offer only social affilia-

Computer Speeds Registration,
Stores Information On Students

By ROBERT PYEATT
Assistant Managing Editor

Computer registration is
the beginning of an eventual
completely computerized col-
lege information system.

The coniputer in Chambers
basement can be used to
speed information handling
and more efficiently determ-
fne averages, make out
grade reports, and a number
of other possible uses, said
Associate Dean of the Fac.
ulty Jay H. Ostwalt.

Using the computer in reg.
istration this year speeded
the process, he said. Those
who had no changes to make
from the courses they signed
up for at the end of last se-
mester moved quickly after
waiting through the lines.

Juniors. were finished by
10:30 a.m. Tuesday and
seniors by 4 p.m.

Under the new system fac
ulty advisers were available
for consultation in- Chambers
basement throughout the reg.
istration period.

“We hope it will make pos.
sible a great deal more per
sonal contact with students
who need help. It will speed
up the mechanical and ad-
ministrative aspects of reg-
istration.’" Ostwalt explained.

Changes made by students
have kept the registrar's of
fice busy until 3 a.m. Wed
nesday morning and until af-
ter midnight Wednesday.

Ostwalt estimated that over
30 per cent of the upperclass-

men made changes in their
previously arranged sched-
ules.

Even on Wednesday. the
first day of classes. 48
changes were made. Each
such change requires _re-
punching six to eight compu-
ter cards.

caused a number of schedul-

the restaurant could create
jobs ‘for a couple of stu-
dents” as well.

Driesell also pointed out
that in his experience with
basketball recruits. “If they
want something to eat at
night, you've got to take
them all. the way to Char
lotte.”*

Mrs. Margaret Pratt, the
present operator of the Col-
lege Restaurant. said that
negotiations for the sale had
been going on for the past
month.

She indicated -that Driesell
had made a ‘‘good offer’’ for
the building and gave that
as one of the reasons for her
wanting to sell the restaurant.

Mrs. Pratt also said that
her husband was nearing re-
tirement age. “I'd like to be
able to retire too,"’ she said.
Mrs. Pratt has worked atthe
College Restaurant for the
past five years.

ing problems was that I mis-
takenly failed to allow an
extra period. six days a
week, for Humanities 11 F,
which meets third period,”
Ostwalt said. The computer
engineered conflicts for the
16 members of the class.

“I'm not griping. 1 think
it moved fast and was well
done,” commented Ostwalt.
“There is room for a great
deal of improvement.”

All the changes made at
registration by sophomores
and juniors were completed
and the cards repunched and
reshuffled by noon Tuesday.
Then these were run through
the computer to check for
conflicts. .

One modification to permit
more than eight scheduling
entries is needed in the com-
puter program. Ostwalt said.
Labs, drill and physical edu-

cation also count as separate
entries in addition to courses.
Some students’ schedules re-
quired more than eight en-
tries.

On students’ changing
courses, O.‘walt pointed out
that Davidson has a very
liberal policy. ‘‘Most schools,
even small colleges, only al-
jow two or three days to
change courses while we al-
low two weeks,” he said.

‘Fantastic’ Student Life
Impresses Equadorian

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Assistant Managing Editor
“Fantastic the life of stu-

dents here—they enjoy ten

limes more than in Equa-
dor.’ according to Marcelo

Saa'm, ah Equadorian stu-

dent who is at Davidson un-

der the sponsorship of the

Proiect of the Americas

(PRAM).

“There is more to enjoy—
like girls."’ he explained, and
added that he was very much
in favor of more girls for
Davidson.

Commenting on his stay at
Davidson, Saa’m expressed
disillusionment with his ac-
commodations, a _ sleeping
bag in the basement of Rich-
ardson. ‘‘They promised me
I was going to find a room,”
he said, “but nothing!"

“The girls—I was most im-
pressed with the girls—fan-
tastic!’" he answered when
asked about what in the
United States most impressed
him.

“The girls here are more
sincere because we can talk
about everything. almost.”
he said. He explained that
they have no prejudice, that
he could talk to them like a
good friend.

In Equador, all dating is
serious, and a girl may be
lucky to have three dates be-
fore marriage.

MARCELO SAA’M
Equadorian Student Sponsored By PRAM

Nine Pramistas
Tour America

Nine students from Equa-
dor have just completed a
month-long tour of the east
ern United States under the
sponsorship of the Project of
the Americas (PRAM), which
is headquartered at David-
son.

The trip. which began in
Miami. Fla.. Aug. 10, includ.
ed visits to Atlanta. several
towns in North Carolina.
Washington. New York. and
the beach.

According to tour director
Chip Vogan, “This year's
group was more responsive
than such a group ever has
been in the past.”

All the students on the tour
were required to write term

papers on a subject dealing:

in some way with the United
States. but the topics ranged
from cybernetics to addict.
ing drugs and their use.
During the trip. the group
met with Georgia Gov. Lester
Maddox in Atlanta, Secretary
of State Dean Rusk in Wash
ington, several city officials
in Winston Salem. and var-

ious members of the U.S. De-
partment of State.

PRAM, which was founded
in 1964 at Davidson by Fred
Ehlers, a Richardson Scholar
from Equador, sponsors these
tours to improve communi-
cation and relations between
the people of South America
and the United States.

The tour was set up under
the supervision of Tom Ped-
dicord. a Davidson student
who is national director of
PRAM. Julian Prosser and
Macky Reavis. also David-
son students. arranged the
stays .in Atlanta and Win-
ston-Salem, respectively,

The group going on the tour
was selected from a list. of
about 200 applicants and was
originally limited to eight
members. However. the stu-
dent who was ninth on the
list. Marcelo Saa'm, decided
to pay his own way and ac.
company the group.

Saa‘m is still at Davidson.
where he is writing his paper,
and will remain until about
Oct. 10.

The remodeling caused sev-
eral changes in procedure.
Students were allowed to
complete summer _ school
work on other campuses due:
to the renovation work. Fac-
ulty and administration of
fices were scattered all over
campus while the construc.
tion continued.

Several academic depart-
ments have now been cluster-
ed together. The math de.
partment has moved to the
first three buildings on Jack-
son Court, with each building
housing two offices and a
classroom.

The psychology department
has moved all its classes to
the completely remodeled
north basement, and the
Bible Department is also
grouped together.

In addition to the normal

classroom changes. several
classes have been converted
to seminar rooms, and two
economics classrooms have
been redone in amphitheater
style.

The renovation of Cham-
bers Building is part of the
expansion and remodeling
Program made possible by
the Ford Challenge Grant
Program, through which the
college will eventually re.
celve $2.2 million in grants.
These grants have also

enabled the college to make
other changes in the campus.
The 100-year-old Philanthro-
pic and Eumanean halls are
being remodeled and air-
condiitoned, and the college
laundry is also changed. The
laundry entrance now faces
west and new equipment has
been added to speed up its
operations.
