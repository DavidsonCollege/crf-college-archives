Tuesday, December 1, that its
PAC-AIR Compression Divi-
sion had plans to construct a
new plant north of Davidson.
Davidson.

Construction has begun on
the 118-acre site located on a
peninsula of Lake Norman.
According to the company’s
presentation, it will be an
all-electric plant with planned
energy plans to maximize use
of natural topography.

The assembly plant will be
built first but engineering,
marketing, sales, and finance
departments will also be lo-
cated at the site. In fact, this
project--valued in excess of
five million dollars--will event-
usually be worldwide head-
quarters for Ingersoll-Rand’s
PAC-AIR Division.

“Not my business”

The arrival of such a large
corporation has caused con-
flict. ‘‘I do not have a great
deal of factual information
about it. It is none of my
nor anyone else’s business,”’
said Mayor Thomas Sadler. “I
think someone is just trying to
stir the pot.”

An article in the Wednes-
day, December 2, 1975 issue of
The Mecklenburg Gazette
touched off the debate. The
article, announcing the com-
pany’s construction, drew im-
mediate reaction from the
Assistant Minister of David-

son College Presbyterian Chu-
rch Rev. Rush Otey.

Otey reaised several ques-
tions: To what extent was the
town’s population involved in
the decision? Will public funds
be used to subsidize Ingersoll-
Rand’s demand for water and
sewage? If so, why Davidson,
since the plant is located in

Iredell County? Were environ-

mental impact studies made
by the town?

Duke Power

Is there any connection
between the sale of the town’s

power system to Duke Power ,

and the arrival of Ingersoll-
Rand? Otey said that ‘‘it is
intriguing that land for the
new plant was purchased from
Duke Power’s land subsid-

”

ery.

Sadler said that the first
talk of an Ingersoll-Rand divi-
sion came about two years
ago. Involved in the discus-
sion then were the Crescent
Land and Timber Company
(from whom the land was
purchased) and the Moores-
ville Chamber of Commerce.
Mooresville later contacted
Davidson College and town
authorities and Piedmont
Bank officials.

Sadler did not know when
the first public announcement
was made, saying that the
town was never in a position to
Say anything concrete until
the corporation gave permis-
sion for the operation.

The Gazette states that its
first article appeared in De-
cember, 1974. At that time the
exact location of the plant was

6338.

noted, but very little other

information was available. .

Commissioner of Davidson H.
Buckling Naramore said that
the Davidson Board of Com-
missioners met December 17,
1974 for the sole purpose of
discussing water and sewage
services to Ingersoll-Rand.
Subsequent action on the
subject took place at meeting
on June 16 and October 20,
1975. But according to the
article in the December 2, 1975
issue of The Gazette, ‘‘we
heard nothing more about the
plant until two weeks ago,
when we met with the project

, manager and were informed

that a lunch was planned for
December 2 to formally an-
nounce the company’s location
here.”’

Sewage service

The plant is to be located in
Iredell County but Davidson
is supplying water and sewage
services. According to Sadler,
the town will supply them
with a sewage system to the
extent of their purchase of
water services. Davidson’s
own facilities should not be
strained.

North Carolina’s Depart-
ment of Natural and Economic
Resources has, after examina-
tion, given approval to a
maximum input by Ingersoll-
Rand into Davidson’s sewer
system of 14,000 gallons per
day.

This arrangement will exist
over a five year period. By
then the North Mecklenburg
Wast Water Treatment Plant
should be in operation; under
Area 201 Plan, it will treat all
waste in North Mecklenburbg
County. Naramore said that
the town agreed to extend the
water and sewage lines a short
distance to the town limits.
The cost thereof will be offset
by the imposition of a mini-
mum monthly water charge to
Ingersoll-Rand and a billing

118 acres

Why is Davidson offering
these services to a plant
located in Iredell County? The
Iredell County line and David-
son City limits form a common
line. According to Mayor Sad-
ler there is nothing between
Davidson and Lake Norman
but those 118 acres. Under
existing laws, one cannot an-
nex undeveloped property into
municipal limits except at
express request of property
owners. Ingersoll-Rand has
declined such a request, pre-
ferring to first establish them-
selves financially. But accord-
ing to Sadler, the corporation
is. well aware that once it has
developed to the extend of 60
percent of its capacity, David-
son can annex and--if ap-
proved by. referendum--will.

Naramore stated that the
proposed location next to
Davidson was announced after
negotiations with Credit Land
and Timber Company had
been concluded and that the
Davidson Town Board took no
part in the proceedings. _

‘*Any implied connection
between this event and the
sale of the town’s electric
system to Duke Power has no
basis in fact,’’ said Sadler.
“There was nothing unusual
about the Piedmont Bank’s
knowledge and ‘‘wooing”’ of
Ingersoll-Rand. A bank courts
people with. interest--especial-
ly those who propose to spend
ten million dollars.”

Marine World

Three years ago a tourist
attraction on Lake Norman,
was proposed. This proposal
for a Marine World was de-
feated by many of the same
arguments used against the
coming of Ingersoll Rand.
Sadler, however, said the

are decidedly different. Marine
World had an expected inter-
mittent basis of 10 to 12
thousand people a day. The
Ingersoll-Rand plant will start
off with 100 people and plans
to eventually employ 750.

In contrast to the tourists of
Marine World, these people
are coming to stay and will
arrive piecemeal. Davidson
would have been asked to
serve the people of Marine
World 365 days a year. But in
Sadler’s opinion, _Ingersoll-
Rand will “bring rather than
take.”’

“By establishing permanent
homes, they will become a part
of the Davidson community.
And the ten million dollars
that Ingersoll-Rand proposes
to invest will broaded the tax
base and lead to reduced state
tax rates. The difference in
traffic caused by Marine
World and by the Ingersoll-
Rand are incomparable.

Water storage

The water situation three
years ago was not good. Since
then Davidson has elevated
storage by 5000 gallons. The
largest problem, however, was
the waste supply. Davidson
has a fixed population of about

3200. With Marine World one

was talking about 12,000 extra
people on a daily basis--par-
ticularly in the summer when
water usage is considered to be
at its highest. According to
Sadler, it was a physical im-
possibility. Also, the North
Mecklenburg 201 Plant was
only a concept then.

It would seem that nearly
all debate on Ingersoll-Rand
centers on what will be the
good for the town of David-
son. During the afternoon
luncheon announcing the cor-
poration’s arrival, Sadler call-
ed the event ‘‘the greatest day
in the town’s history.”

It is unusual that a town
with no particular industry
should attract two giant cor-
porations, and he eagerly
“‘Welcomed the area’s newest
corporate member, Duke Pow-
er Company, and its newest
corporate neighbor, Ingersoll-
Rand.”

Others, like Otey, are not so

happy.
