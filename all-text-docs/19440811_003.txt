The race seems to be between the Kappa
Sigs who tied with the Betas last time and
the Pi Kap-PiKa-K. A. team, which has
won three games to date and plays the
Sigmas Wednesday. This game should be
a pitcher's battle between Bill Medford of
the Sigmas and Phil Medford of the Tri-

team they will play only-high schools and prep schools and |

maybe a college freshman team. Nothing is certain about

this as yet but it is entirely possible that some schedule
can be worked out if there are enough boys who have had |
experience to enable the Cats to turn out a representative |
team. |

Word has been received that Jim Owens who played
a lot of shortstop for Davidson three years ago has been |
killed in action, and Joe McCoy who was manager ot the|
Cat basketball team two years ago has been wounded. This
war will probably take a lot of Davidson athletes before
it is over but all of them will in some way leave their mark

upon Davidson records and upon Davidson traditions, |
know Jim Owens did. .

Cat ‘football fans probably saw in the Sunday paper
that Dave Spencer, formerly Davidson football and basket
ball star and now Lt. He had
been missing for some time and now has turned up safe in

Spencer, has turned up.

England, Dave was the only Cat gridder ever to play in
the annual North-South game at Montgomery.

The

Kappa Sigs by the Independents.
The Independents, beaten soundly
by ‘the Betas and the Pi- Kaps,
played faultless ball and surprised
everyone by ‘coming out on top 6-2
allowing one run in the sixth and
fone in the seventh. The Kappa
Sigs played with very little snap
and spirit; and were in hot water all
the way. Medford pitched for the

Sigmas, but received very little sup
