DAFFY DITTIES

The Boarding House or the Hash |

Hound’s Lament

“What care I for swell cafes?” the hand-
sothe hash hound cried, “The boarding
house’s my only praise, my only hope and
pride. The restaurants don't interest me,
nor tea-rooms with their truck of rolls and
jam, denatured tea—with them I have no
luck. The hash house is my only chance to
sit awhile and blow; the only place I give
perchance my appetite a show. A waiter’s
check no more I dread, in peace I sit and
eat, my bank book forges right ahead and
living is a treat. Yet some will kick about
the feed served to them table d’hote while
I to worries pay no heed nor let them get my
goat.

“Time was when I did cuss, and fret, about
the hash house chow. Small wonder that
I’m peevish yet with wrinkles on my brow.
Three times a day in every way I’d test the
bill of are; to find some tid-bit I would
pray, but useless was my prayer. These
handouts did for other lads, and filled them
with delight, but hash and prunes toned down
my poise, my carcass looked a fright. Three
times a day on grits I fed, with syrup for
dessert; the flies and bugs dwelt in my
bread and made my inwards hurt. Some-
times for change they laid out prunes or
maybe moulded wheat. They got my palate
out of tune with what they had to eat. The
waiter kept his tongue in check, a lout he
was and slow. He spilt the gravy down my
neck and softly murmured ‘Oh.’ I’d turn my
head, my meat was gone, vamoosed into thin
air; in vain I’d moan and bellow on, in vain
I'd pull my hair. Week in, week out, the
constant fare it was my lot to learn while
I sat calmly in my lair, and for a change did
yearn of something save the spuds and grits
dished to us a la carte, that knocked us for
a good two bits until our ways did part.

“Yet, withal, they’re needed here till man
no longer feeds on products of this grand

old sphere that fills his inwards’ needs;

Is Davidson, Presbyterian or Zoroasterian?
Zoroaster was a pretty good old bird in
his day, and people made a big fuss over

him, but if he was running things now, I'll
swear I believe he would get a little more
system into things.

Fire No, 1 should not have been arranged
so far from the campus. Lots of people
were too far gone to enjoy it at all when
they arrived. The time was about right
though; it broke up the literary society meet-
ings. ;
As for No, 2, the chief thing wrong with
it, besides its lack of publicity, was that none
took advantage of the beautiful and charm-
ing apportunities to perform gallant rescues,
and become heroes in real romances.

No, 3 was simply a fizzle.

No. 4 was a complete success, Old Zoro,
himself, could have done no better. The
whole affair was perfect. The burning was
scientifically arranged, and the ruins were
magnificent. The timing of the ceremony
was also calculated to a nicety. It took place

when there was an abundance of spectators.
It was late enough to permit all who desired
such, a long night’s sleep before it was dis-
covered, and just early enough in the morn-
ing for the darkness of night to render the
lurid glare the more impressive. Excellent!

The plans for No. 5, wern’t much force.
The whole thing amounted to nothing more
than a pretty punk bush.

No, 6 was a little better. Zoroaster would
probably have had a good deal of praisé for
Mrs. Wagner. Of course, it being only an
oil stove in question, the thing could not
have been expected to burn up completely,
but during the two hours that she left it, it
blackened the room to such an extent that it
took two whole days to clean it. Pretty
durn good!

The plans for No. 7 were of course on a
modest scale also but the success was fair.
Strictly speaking, no more could have been
required of it, but it certainly missed an
opportunity when it left the Eu hall stand-
ing.

Nothing really extravagant can be said for
No. 8. The ignition was commendable, the
day of the week, and the time of day were
well chosen, but if the stunt had only been
pulled off when there was a strong wind

blowing either up or down dormitory row,
it would have heen quite a success,

No. 9 was sorry. It was simply punk.
In the first place the excitement caused by
it would have been completely overshadowed
by the other fire. Then, the plan was alto-
gether too hastily conceived and poorly exe-

THE REEL STUFF

The moving picture attraction for this
week will be “The Hottentot,” a First Na-
tional directed by Thomas H. Ince.

The latest big stage success to be adopted
by the movies is “The Hottentot,” Willie
Collier’s successful comedy that rocked the
entire country. A record run of two years,
playing Broadway and fouring the country,
was made by Willie Collier and his company
with this stage play, which has been adapted
for the screen by Thomas H. Ince. It tells
the hilariously funny story of a yachtsman,
terrified of horses who is mistaken for a
famous steeplechaser of the same name, and
finally forced to ride in a breakneck race.

The stars in this production are Douglas
MacLean, who made quite a reputation for
himself in “Twenty-three and a Half Hours
Leave,” and Madge Bellamy, who formerly
played on Broadway. In “The Hottentot,”
MacLean takes the role which was played
by William Collier on the stage.

In “When Knighthood Was In Flower,”
Henry VIII was always calling out the
guards. This calls to mind the S. A. T. C.
days. According to the story, the beautiful
English Princess, Mary Tudor, was received
with royal honors in Paris, but old Louis
soon discovered that while he had bargained
for a Queen, he had not gained a wife.
Mary leads him a merry chase and he soon
dies. Three thousand persons were required
for the filming of the wedding scene. .

asunder the charter of his own and his chil-
dren’s liberty—Abraham Lincoln.

DAVIDSON, N. C.

PHE alchemists wrote
% vaguely of “fluids” and
f ‘‘principles.’”” Copper
5S was potentially silver.
Rid it of its red color and the
“principle” of silver would: assert
itself, so that silver would remain.
With a certain amount of philos-
opher’s stone (itself a mysterious
“‘principle”) a base metal could be
converted into a quantity of gold
a million times as great.

This all sounded so “practical”
that Kings listened credulously,
but the only tangible result was
that they were enriched with much
bogus gold.

Scientific theorists like Robert
Boyle (1627-1691) proved more
“‘practical”’ by testing matter, dis-
covering its composition and then
drawing scientific conclusions that
could thereafter be usefully and
honestly applied. Alchemists con-
jecturedanddied;heexperimented
and lived.

Using the air pump Boyle un-
dertocke a “theoretical” but sci-

entific experimental study of the
atmosphere and discovered that
it had a “spring” in it, or in other
words that it could expand. He
also established the connection
between the boiling point of water
and atmospheric pressure, a very
“theoretical” discovery in his day
but one which every steam engi-
neer now applies.

He was the first to use the term
“analysis” in the modern chem-
ical sense, the first to define an
element as a body which cannot
be subdivided and from which
compounds can be reconstituted.

Boyle’s work has not ended.
Today in the Research Labora-
tories of the General Electric
Company it is being continued.
Much light has there been shed
on the chemical reactions that
occur in a vessel in which a nearly
perfect vacuum has been produced.
One practical result of this work
is the vacuum tube which plays an
essential in radio work and
roentgenology.
