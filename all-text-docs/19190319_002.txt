PHYSICAL EDUCATION.

The past 18 months of warfare have

been rich in national experience, and if
we will stop to analyze that experience
many valuable deductions may be made.
In turn, if we profit by our deductioas,
making practical application of wise rein
edies in future policy we may turn a pot:
tion of the experience of war to the per-
manent benefit of the Nation.

Among the foremost of these experi-
ences stands the fact that as a nation we
were not physically efficient. We have
gone on our way happy in the thought
thar we could meet the nations of the
world at the Olympic games with a team
of athletic specialists who have always
managed. to give a most excellent  ac-
count of themselves. We have patron-
ized with enthusiasm = the — gladiatorial
combat. We have paid our money gladly
to see a handful of men strive valiantly
on the athletic field while we, comfort-
ably seated, were not deriving any im-
proved digestion or reduced waistline.
‘Vo be sure, we have enjoyed ourselves,
and that is the main thing that justifies
this type of athletic competition, As a
system of physical education it does not
justify itself. As a recreational agency
it is of value in so far as the objection
able features are kept out and the whole-
some spirit of sportsmanship is culti-
vated.

The educational institutions of the
Nation can well afford to give time and
thought to more comprehensive systems
of physical education. ‘They should dig-
nify the department of physical educa-
tion, have very definite requirements and
give credit toward graduation for work
satisfactorily accomplished. A number
of institutions have done this already.
This will act as an incentive to the stu-
dent.

The object of all education being to
develop the latent possibilities of a man
and to give him an appreciation of the
higher values of life that will make him
a far more valuable member of society,
why not give him also a healthy, well
disciplined body? Surely if there is any
one thing that makes life worth iving, it
is the ability to face the tasks of the day
with the enthusiasm of good health and
the general feeling of physical well-being.

Started By Students
Davidson’s Fallen Heroes to be Re-

membered.

At the special meeting of the student
bedy on last ‘Thursday morning, it was
decided unanimously that a fund be rais-
ed by the students for a momerial to the
18 fallen heroes of the Davidson alumni
and student body. “This fund will be
raised by subscriptions from the fellows,
many of whom will soon be in possessign | «
of the $60 banus froin the War Depart-

ment. “This fact will help many make a
subscription who otherwise could not
de so.

Dr. McConnell presented the — plan
and made a short and very forceful talk,
which put the men to thinking seriously
about the matter. Some of the points
which Dr. McConnell stressed were:
‘That this memorial would not be in
honer of Davidson, but it would be a
tribute to those men who, because of
their ideals, gave their lives for the cause
of Justice. “That in doing honor to these
men of character, the students would
honor themselves by giving something
for a gift, even though small compared
with their gift to us and to humanity.
Short talks in a similar vein were made
by Mr. Jackson and Coach Fetzer, after
which the suggested plain was put before
the house and unanimously accepted.

Although no definite form of — me-
morial was decided upon, a committee
was appointed by the president, Mr.
Miller, to make some suggestions. The
two. memorials supgested, however, were
a large gate at the entrance to the
campus, and a swimming pool for the
evm. ‘The swimming pool seemed to
meet with more approval as it would not
only be more useful to the Davidson stu-
dents but it would complete the plans
which were made for the gymnasium,
which is an alumni building.

The subscription sheets were dis-
tributed through the hall and turned
over to Mr, Jackson, who was elected
treasurer of the campaign.

LIFE.

Man comes into this world without
his consent and leaves without his will.

During his stay on earth his time is
spent in one continuous round of misun-
derstandings. In his infancy he is an
angel; in his boyhood he is a devil; in
his. manhood he is everything from a
lizard up: in his duties he is a fool; i
he raises a family he is a chump; if he
raises a check he is a thief and the law
raises — with him: if he is a poor man
he is a poor manager and has no sense;

df he is rich he is dishonest but it con-

sidered smart: if he is in politics he is a
grafter and a crook; if he is out of poli-
tics you can't please him, as he is an “un-
desirable citizen,” if he goes to church
he is a hypocrite; if he stays away he is
a sinner; if he donates to foreign mis-
sions he does it for show; if he does not
he is stingy and a “‘tightwad.”

When he first comes into this world
everybody wants to kiss him—before he
goes out they all want to kick him; when
he is a little fellow the big girls all kiss
him; when he is a big fellow the little
girls all kiss him.

Tf he dies young there was a great
future before him; if he lives to a ripe
old age he is in the way, only living to
save funeral expenses,

Life’s a funny proposition after all.

As we grow older we learn that our
worst troubles are those that never hap-
pen.

Beware of the man who can’t stare
you in the face and the woman who can.

ODDS AND ENDS.

It seems that the Rumpleites persisted
in exercising the theorem that. “a
straight line is the shortest distance be-
tween two points” until more stringent
means than “appeals” had to be used.
We suppose now that they have been
sufficiently “horsed.”

Mr. Harvey Branscombe. a Y. ML. C.
A. secretary from the Atlanta offices.
was on the Hill last week from Thurs-
day until Saturday morning. Mr. Brans-
combe is making a tour of all the South-
érn colleges and his main objective is to
impress the importance of making the de-
cision for life-work, while in’ college.
During his short stay here he lectured at
the “Y" Forum meeting, and held con-
ferences with many of the fellows on
this subject. Mr. Branscombe’'s visit was
a very successful one, for there are, a
great number of students on the campus
who have no special’ work in which they
are interested and towards which they
are bending their efforts.

KE. G. Lilly was in Winston over the
week-end developing his social faculties.
His frequent trips and ardent ravings
indicate he is fast becoming a social lion.

“A-a-ha!” hisses the villian and the
“Y" movies are on. Save for a few
song books that rain continuously from
the gallery the house is silent. Harold.
the handsome hero, licks seven prototypes
of Jess Willard, and the picture is pro-
nounced a success.~-Ex.

The man who most deserves help
would die rather than acept it.
