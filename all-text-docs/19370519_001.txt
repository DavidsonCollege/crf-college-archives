Improvements Noted
The growth of Davidson in ‘the
past century has been accompanied

by numerous improvements on the

campus.

Only thirty years ago students
rented their’ rooms totally ynfur-
nished. A sewage system was 1n-
stalled in 1909, The grass of the
campus was cut just. twice a year.

Pride in the appearance of the
campus increased with the new
buildings. The grass was fertil-

ized and the trees pruned. Walks
have been paved in the last ten
years, as have the drives about the
campus. The construction the
athletic fields now used was a ma-

of

jor improvement.

Numerous class gifts have also

added to the beauty of the college.
