Basketballers High Hopes
Go To Conference Meet:

Carrying an 18-6 won-lost record, the best in Davidson's basketball history, into}
the Southern Conference tournament, the Davidson Wildcats met the Keydets of VMI
yesterday afternoon in the first round of tournament action.

nounced, and it turned out that he beat three-time All-
Conference team? That's the problem Fred Hetzel has had
(The voting is conducted among sportscasters, writers,
and coaches.)

This is one of the most spectacular achievements

ever accomplished in the history of Davidson athletics.

The only comparable honor in basketball that we can,

think of was won by Tommy Peters who was chosen to
the all-time All-Conference team even though he only
played one year of basketball at Davidson.

We are extremely proud of Hetzel for getting this |
honor, which he surely deserved, (conference leader in|
scoring and shooting percentage, and a top rebounder), |
and we know that it is only one of many he will receive.

Not meaning anv disrespect for Tommy Peters, Whit
Cobb, Hobby Cobb, or anv others, we think that ,
Hetzel is the greatest basketbaii player ever at Davidson. |

Rounding out the first five in the balloting were
Rod Thorn (W. Va.), Howard Pardue (VPI), Jerry Smith |
(Furman), and Gerald Glur (Furman). Noticeable in his |
absence was ’Cat senior Bill Jarman who led the second |
team voting. This is twice that Jarman has been put on
the second team when he should be on the first. We say,
there shouldn't be any doubt that he is better than Glur. |
At least Jarman is probably the best second string All-
Conference player they’ve ever had.

Now we come to the third member of the ’Cat front,
line who we also think got a bad deal. Junior Terry Hol. |
land wasn’t even chosen to the All-Conference second |
team and we feel that this is at least as great an injustice!
as done to Jarman. There’s still one way to show them j
the error of their ways and that’s the tournament. We

hope the ’Cats tear them up.

MOVE THE TOURNAMENT !

Mr. Lloyd Jordan, a representative of the Southern
Conference, who was at the Wake Forest game in the
Coliseum last week was noncommittal about his
purpose for being there. He was sent by the conference
to look over Charlotte and the coliseum as a prospective
site to hold the Southern Conference basketball tourna-
ment next year, but we couldn’t get that impression from
talking to him—he was completely closed-mouth about
it. In fact all he would talk about was the fine basketball
game that the ’Cats were playing. (We had to agree with

him there.)

Although Jordan re-
mained fairly closemouthed,
he did give certain impres-
sions that were favorable to §
getting the tourney to Char- }
lotte next year. First, he in-
dicated that the tourney
would probably not be held |
at Richmond next year, and
secondly, that he was very
impressed with the coliseum
and the crowds that we can
draw there.

Editor Warren Koon of the _ ++. Som
Charleston, S. C., News and Courier in a column “Time

at Richmond they make pitifully little, with no prospects

Jarman Hits 30
As Deacons Fall

BY FORREST ROLES
Sports Staff Writer

“It’s a good year to be a senior,” said a jubilant Bill
Jarman Wednesday a week ago. “Every year I’ve been
here we've beaten an A.C.C. team for Coach, and this year
we got two.” The 'Cats, led by Jarman, had just beaten
Wake Forest 90-75, and there was cause to be jubilant.

It was probably Jarman’s best (16.4 ppg.), field goal percent-
game of the season. He hit nine age (50%), foul throw percent-
of fourteen shots from the floor age (77.2%), and total rebound

It was announced this week
that sophomore star Fred Hetzel
has been chosen to head the
1963 edition of the All-Southern
Conference team. It was the
first time since 1958, when
Jerry West of West Virginia and
pro ball fame, that a sophomore
has led the balloting.

Hetzel nosed out three-time
All-Conference guard Rod Thorn
of West Virginia by 14 votes,
428 to 414. Other members of
the first team are Howard Par-
due of VPI, Jerry Smith of
Furman, and Gerald Glur of
Furman. This is the third year
on the team for Smith and
Thorn, the second for Pardue.

Baseball Practice

have a good season.”

are Juniors Eddie Earle and
Bob King. Earle was Kline's re-
placement last year but failed to
show a strong bat in the few
times he appeared at the plate.
King has no catching experience,
but appears to have the tools to
make a strong receiver.

man Tom Whitley, and pitchers
Jim Moore and Tommy Hamil-
ton are in line for a good deal
of action. Rick Smyre and Tony
McNay are battling for the
first base position and either
Ben Goldsmith, Steve Clark, or
Phil Squier should play short-
stop.

The outfield appears strong
with L. H. Hutchins, Earl Cole,
Alec Gibbs, and Car! Rust re-
turning. Smyre and Hamilton
also have outfield experience.

“I just hope the weather's
good,” said Stevens. “We don’t
have very long to get ready for
our first game.”

The ’Cats open their twenty-
seven game schedule against
local baseball talent Pfeiffer
here on March 18.

Despite all this, Jarman has
had to watch his name practical-
ly erased from Davidson's rec-
ord book. Sophomore Fred Het-

Now, Captain Bill Jarman is
leading the ’Cats on the tough-

Parker, who had hoped that

hope dimmed by injuries. He
still, however, believes his squad
has a chance for a second or
third spot in the conference.

The largest of Parker's woes
is the 147 lb. spot. This spot
was securely filled by sopho-
