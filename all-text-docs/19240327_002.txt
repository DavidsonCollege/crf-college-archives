Interclass Track Meet
Junior Week Feature

——_

Winning Class Entitled to Hold
Richardson Cup for One Year

As an added feature of Junior Week,
an Inter-Class Track Meet has been ar-
ranged for Saturday, April 19th. Until
recently this meet was held each year,
but for the past few years, for one rea-
son or another, has not been held. The
class winning the meet will be entitled to
the possession of the Richardson cup
for one year. This cup was last won by
the Class of ’21. All men not on the
varsity track will be eligible to represent
their own class. To the man winning the
highest number of points in the meet
will be given the honor of choosing the
queen of the day. Each class is urged
to put nito the field as strong a team as
is possible.

Other features of the entertainment
planned for Junior week are the per-
and the Dramatic Club. It is also rumor-
ed that Piggy Martin and his committee
have something else up their sleeves.

Captain Ellis Grooms

Team for V. P.I. Meet

Davidson Track Squad Works
Hard for Techmen

With the V. P. I. track meet only one
week distant, Captain Ellis was forced
to hold tryouts Tuesday and Wednesday
on a track which recent rains had left
in bad condition. The results of these
tryouts were not obtainable when the
Davidsonian went to press, and so a
summary of the material out for the
team is all that can be given here.

The Wildcats have been severely handi-

capped by weather conditions but in
spite of this the men are in good con-
dition, and it is believed that V. P. I, will
not be able to repeat her runaway of last
year. The Techmen are more seriously
handicapped than Davidson’s squad by
the inclement weather which has pre-
vailed in Virginia, and have been work-
ing out in the gymnasium. Reports have
it, however, that V. P. I. returned all of
her last year’s cinder squad, so the meet
on April 3rd will be a hotly contested
one,
The track at Richardson field has been
a scene of activity every afternoon for
two weeks, and neither coach nor spec-
tators could state with any degree of
certainty what men would nose out for
first places in the tryouts.

Captain Streibich has been laid up with
a sprained ankle, but hopes to be in
condition forthe initial meet. Holder of
the college record in the pole vault, he
should have no trouble in winning that
event. He will also run the high hurdles
and enter the broad jump event.

Gracey, is out for the same events as
Streibich, and in addition will probably
hurl the javelin apd try the high jump.
Last.. year Davidson could count on
Gracey for a number of markers on her
score in every meet; indications are that
he will sustain his record.

In the dashes, Koenig is on the track
again this season, after missing last sea-
son because of illness. Those who saw
Koenig sprint during his Freshman year
and those who have watched his work-
outs this spring are confident that he will
be a winner on the short races, up
through the 440. Hendrix will also be a
hard man to pass on the sprints. Smith
and Matthews are good bets in the hun-
dred and 220-yard runs. Bouvier and
Green are among others out for the 440.
The abundance of good material for the
quarter-mile has’ drawn from Coach Ellis
the statement that he would like to see
a mile relay team in action this year.

Nappy Davis will probably lead the
half-mile, but for the other position
there will be much. competition—Adams,
Shaw, Appleby, and Parker being in good
shape for this 880-yard race.

In the mile run, Spec McConnell is ex-
pected to win the majority of his meets
this year, while Gudger and P. M. Patter-
son will fight it out forthe other berth.
Angus McBryde still reels off the laps in
the two-mile, and the man who wins
over Ang will have to break a Davidson
track record. Williford and Selser are
in splendid shape for this event.

The weights will probably be divided
between Lindamood, Gracey, White, and
LL. P. Cox, and some of these men will
hurl the javelin.

“Red” Malloy, McPhaul, and Anderson
wre likely candidates forthe pole vault
position, besides Streibich and Gracey.
Gracey, Anderson, and White seem to
have the best form on the high jump,
while the two first-named will probably
take care ofthe high hurdles run with
Streibich.

The low hurdles race seems to lie be-
tween Mallery, Parrish, and Anderson,
all of these men having shown good
form. ,

The broad jump is still a matter of
conjecture, though Hendrix, Vance, Mat-
thews, or Miller could take care of this
event in good style.

The Dope Fiend

By W. F. Galloway

Track and baseball ready to open up.

The varsity got off to a good start with
a 17-2 victory over the freshmen.

Ang McBryde is back on the cinders
again. Ang was the feature of the outfit
his first year.

A bad side held him up a couple of
seasons but everything seems to be O. K.
this spring.

Frock Oak Ridge, varsity.

The Oak Ridge boys have split the
series for the last three years. How
about two straight this time.

The next year’s wrestling menu is
likely to include both Army and Navy.

That is a little something to work for.

Alford draws the first home run on
Richardson field. Let’s ditto that in a
scheduled game.

The new fence around the golf course
will be quite the stuff. Nothing like
something to keep the balls in.

some good representatives. Cox and EI-
kins have both occupied berths on de-
bating teams before, beirg members of
a team which defeated Trinity last year,
and Wharton was an Qlternate on the
Washington and Lee team last year.
While Story and Walthall have never
made the teams, they have always been
strong contenders. Little came to David-
son from Tulane University, and is
reputed to be a good speaker.

All of these men have been doing hard
work on the debate, and are reading
deeply on the subject. They will be ful-
ly prepared to uphold Davidson’s banner
on the platform against Emory and
Trinity,

Court Team Meets South
Atlantic Champions Here

Woods and Spence, Former Wild-
cats, Hold South Atlantic Doubles
Championship

The crack tennis team of Union Sem-
inary begins a two-days meet with the
Wildcat racketeers on Saturday, April
5th. The two members of the team,
Tom Spence and Edgar Woods, will each
play a singles match with Davidson’s
best solo men and then will combine to
meet the D, C. doubles team. Monday
three similar matches will be run off.

Spence and Woods showed their class
last spring by running through ‘to the
championship of the South Atlantic.
Dope has it that they are now better than
ever. The Wildcat four: Harry Price,
Tom Staley, Mac Beall and Jim Trotter,
although handicapped by a late start,
are working hard to keep the seminary
boys from having a walk-away.

After Union Seminary comes Colgate
University. The inclusion of Davidson
College in the Southern tour of this or-
ganization puts D. C.’s tennis men on a
par with Eastern teams. Colgate never
fails to put out its best for the tour
through the Carolinas, Georgia and Vir-
ginia, and Colgate’s best is well up in the
first flight. This meet, coming on April
14th, ends the Wildcat’s stay at home.

These two meets with the South’s
finest will put as keen an edge to the

Wildcat’s claws as a longer season of
play could. All four men are entered in
the State tournament.

After this state meet the Davidson men
invade the home of the Tarheels. Caro-
lina has the best prospects for a cham-
pionship team, but if Price, Staley, Beall
and Trotter improve at the rate they are
going now a real surprise will be sprung
and the Wildcats will bring back the
bacon.

Trinity, State, amd Wake Forest may
also be met by the Presbyterians on their
home courts. Although it is early for
definite dope, Davidson ought to do more
than break even on this tour as is shown
by the clean sweep over Wake Forest
last fall.

Davidson has a alumnus to be proud of
in this rangy lady from Huntington, Va.,
known so well to the men of the three
upper classes as Warhoss.

Warhoss set out at the beginning of
his freshman year, among other things,
to make a basketball player of himself.
Inexperienced at first, it took him three
years to find himself a berth on the Wild-
cat “Poison” squad. But when he did,
he made things hum. “Warhoss” worked
hard for three years on his class basket-
ball teams. When the ’22 cage season
came around he was ready to do his stuff
in a way that has seldom been equalled
and never surpassed at the center posi-
tion of a Wildcat quintet.

“Warhoss” played rings around all his
