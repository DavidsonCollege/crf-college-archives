The Newspaper Fund, supported
by grants from The Wall Street
Journal, will for the fourth
straight year make it possible
for college students to obtain
positions with leading news-
papers throughout the country.

The Fund, one of the few or-
ganizations of its .ype, provides
an opportunity for those inter-
ested in journalism to obtain
profitable jobs in a field in
which summer jobs are scarce.

The deadline for applications
is Jan. 15.

While the fund gives some
preference to college juniors,
the only real eligibility qualifi-
cation is that the applicant have
an interest in journalism. An-
other prerequisite is that the
applicant be willing to work for
ten weeks full time, and prob-
ably in some area other than his
home town.

A student working under this
program will work at “gather-
ing. writing, and editing the
news,” according to a memoran-
dum sent out by the Fund.

The. monetary benefits are
two-fold: first, the student will
be paid for his services by the
newspaper that employes him,

Salem Witch Hunt Tradition

BY CARL KLEIN
Freshman

Fearless action on the part of a few Davidson students recently foiled four
members of an international stationery-selling ring.

The quartet is believed to
have stolen onto the campus
during the last drill period be-
fore Christmas, under the guise
of ROTC cadets. They were not
completely undetected at this
time (one was given a demerit
for failure to learn his rifle
number), but they managed to
remain on campus, hiding out
on the cross-country course un-
til they saw their opportunity.
On Friday, Jan. 14, they struck.

They chose well. The campus
security officer was not yet back
from California, where he had
single-handedly supervised the
Tournament of Roses parade, so
the villains were unhindered
until late in the afternoon, when
one was captured by the super-
visor of dormitories, Mrs. J. B.
Moore (Heroine).

The replacement security of-
ficer was alerted and student
volunteers (posse) joined in the
manhunt. Within a few moments
one of the villains was spotted

ing for one of his comrades;
whom he described as wearing
pants. A quick search of the hall
revealed no one fitting that de-
scription, and the villain was
ejected by a group lead by
Decker Faw and Albert Keiser
(bouncers). Faw carried a six
iron and Keiser flung a few
withering remarks.

The villain made his fatal er-
ror in reappearing on that hall
later in the evening, claiming
to have been hired by the col-
lege to round up solicitors in

the wholesome, red-blooded oc-
cupants of that hall could stand.
As soon as the villain (sss!) de-
parted, those loyal sons of Dav-
idson formed a vigilante com-
mittee (posse), which sub-
sequently functioned about as
smoothly as a ROTC drill unit.

The villain (boo!) attempted
the back stairs but was prevent-
ed from making an early escape
by Arnie Goodstein (Hero), who
was soliciting funds for the
YMCA. When the villain finally
got to the door, he was stopped
by the group guarding it, and
was dragged, kicking and
screaming, to the gymnasium
parking lot. There a noose was
strung up to a telephone pole
by Mike Smith (another Hero).

By this time, however the vil-
lain had found protection be-
hind the replacement security
officer. The anger of the mob
vented itself instead on another
villain who had entered the

“Sneak-grifter!”, © and “Dirty

emitted an exclamation, “Oh,

A GUIDE FOR THE UNMONEYED

R. L. Signfoos was a keen, ambitious lad, and when he finished
high school he wished mightily to go on with his education. It
seemed, however, a forlorn hope. R. L.'s father could not send
the boy to college because a series of crop failures had brought
him to the brink of disaster. (R. L.’s father raised orchids which,
in North Dakota, is a form of agriculture fraught with risk.)
It was, therefore, squarely up to R. L. He could go to college
only if he worked his way through. This was a prospect that
dismayed him. He had a deep-seated fear that the task would
be too great, that he would never be able to carry on a full, busy.
college life and still find time to do odd jobs and make money.
Racked with misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pondering
his dilemma. One day, walking and brooding, he came upon a
park bench and sat down and lit a Marlboro cigarette. R. L.
always lit a Marlboro when he was low in his mind. R. L. also-
always lit a Marlboro when he was merry. The fact is there is
no occasion—happy or sad, pensive or exuberant, cheery or °
solemn—when Marlboro with its fine filter and fine flavor is
not entirely welcome, as you will discover when you go to your
favorite tobacconist and buy some, as we—the makers of
Marlboro and I and R. L. Sigafoos—hope you will do real soon.
Sitting and thinking and smoking a Marlboro on the park
bench, R. L. was suddenly interrupted by a small, quavering
voice which said, ‘‘My boy, you are troubled. Can I help?”

Seated beside R. L. was a tiny, gnarled man with wispy,
snow-white hair. His skin was almost transparent, showing 8
delicate tracery of fragile bones beneath. His back was bent,
and his hands trembled. But his eyes were bright and clear.
R. L. looked into those eyes, into the wrinkled face. He saw
wisdom there, and experience, and kindness. “Do you think,
sir,” said R. L., “that a boy can work his way through college
and stil enjoy a tich, full campus life?”

“Why, bless you, son,” replied the stranger with a rheum
chuckle, “of course you can. In fact, I did it myself.” y

“Was it very hard?” asked R. L.

“Yes, it was hard,” the stranger admitted. “But when one
is young, all things are possible. I, for example, used to get up
at five o’clock every morning to stoke the furnace at the SAE
house. At six I had to milk the ewes at the echool of animal
husbandry. At seven I gave a feacing lesson to the Dean of
Women. At eight I had a class in early Runic poete. At nine I
gave haircuts at the Gamma Phi Beta house. At ten I had dif-
ferential caloulus. At eleven I for a life class. At twelve
I watered soup at the Union. At one I had a class in Oriental
languages. At two 1 exercised the mioe in psych lab. At three
I gave the Dean of Women another fencing lesson. At four I
had qualitative analysis. At five I went clamming. At six I cut
meat for the football team. At seven I ushed at the movies. At
eight I had my ears pierced so that at nine I could tell fortunes
in 6 gypsy tearoom. At ten I had a class in astronomy. At
eleven I tucked in the football team. At twelve I studied and
at three I went to sleep.”

“Sir,” cried R. L., “I am moved and inspired by your shin-
ing example!”

“Tt was nothing,” said the stranger modestly, shaking his
frail white head. “It was just hard work, and hard work never
hurt anybody.”

“Would you mind telling me, sir,” said R. L., “how old you
are n

“Twenty-two,” said the stranger.
