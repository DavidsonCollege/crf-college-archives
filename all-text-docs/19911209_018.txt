Hockey Players Selected to
Southeast and National Tournaments

By Jennifer Roos

Inaddition to winning the Deep
South Tournament, nine Davidson
players were selected to represent
the Deep South at the Southeast
Tournament in Baltimore. The
Deep South sent three teams to the
tournament, a collegiate team, a
club team and a mixed team of
college and club players. For the
second consecutive year, more
players from Davidson were se-

lected than from any other school
or club team.

Emily Coleman, Fran Fierro,
Suzanne Hardesty, Simone
Plaisance, Jenny Plowright, Jen-
nifer Roos and Jacquelin Ukrop
represented Deep South I, and Jill
Bennett and Erin Lang represented
Deep South II. Coleman, Fierro,
Plaisance and Roos were chosen
for the Deep South All-Tourna-
ment Team.

a blowout..Detlef Musch twice dunked after catching lob passes as thi
Wildcats assumed a 15-6 lead. But the Tribe’s second unit brought then
ck, scoring 14 points in succession to take a 20-15 edge.

Davidson ended the half with a 13-6 spurt to regain the lead. Senio1
tri-captain Paul Drobnitch put in a pair of offensive rebound baskets in:
that span, and Frank Harris’ layup with :02 remaining in the half ‘gave the
Wildcats a 28-26 advantage at the half.

The second half was hardfought; after William and Mati took a
seven point lead with 13:40 to go, senior Sterling Freeman led the
Davidson comeback. In eightminutes of action, Freeman scored 5 points
and captured 7 rebounds, 6 of them offensive. His layup gave the ‘Cats
a 58-56 cushion with 3:36 left, and his free throw at the 1:39 mark sent
the game into overtime.

Inthe extrasession, Janko Narat gave the Wildcats their last lead, 63-
62, on a reverse layup with 3:37 left. In the next two minutes, though,
while the Tribe’s offense executed and scored, Davidson’s didnot. Scott
Smith’s fading jumper gave W&M a four point lead they would not re-
linquish. The Tribe missed several late free throws to give the ‘Cats a
chance, before Holloway’s bid for a game-winning shot went awry.

For Davidson coach Bob McKillop, the way in which the Tribe took ~

Musch out of the game in the second half was decisive to the outcome.
“They [W&M] came out in the second half and attacked us in the paint,”
he said. “That wore down Detlef. He got tired and moved off the block.”
Consistently in the second half, Musch was pushed outside his comfort-
able shooting range and his shots fell short. He finished 4-12 from the
field.
Another important factor in the loss was Davidson’ s 8-16 effort at
the free throw line. William and Mary was only a little better, at 10-19.
Holloway led the team with 16 points; Harris and Ron Fisron added 10.
