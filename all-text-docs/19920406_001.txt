Two Students Awarded
Watson Fellowship

By Jeff Oller

On March 17, Davidson sen-
iors John Patton and Tom Johnson
were awarded Watson Fellowship
awards. The Thomas J. Watson
Foundation, which awards the fel-
lowships, was founded in 1961 by
Mrs. Thomas J. Watson Sr., in
honor of her late husband.

In 1968 the Foundation intro-
duced a Fellowship program de-
signed to enable college graduates
of exceptional promise to engage
in a year of independent study and
travel abroad following graduation.
Since 1968, approximately 1600
Watson Fellowship awards have
been made with stipends totaling
over $15 million. )

The brochure, available in
Dean Terry’s office, stated, “The
Fellowship experience is intended
to provide Fellows an opportunity
to immerse themselves in cultures
other than their own for an entire

”

year.

They search for individuals |

who “demonstrate integrity, strong. }

ethical character, intelligence, thé
capacity for vision and leadership
and potential for humane and ef-
fective participation in the world
community.”

A candidate is to propose a
project that indicates concern and
personal commitments. The proj-
ect should not involve extended
Study at a foreign university and,
thus, should be a¢reative, feasible
and personally sibnificant project
that one can pursue with independ-
ence and adaptability.

Consideration for the Watson
Fellowship award is open to all
graduation seniors regardless of
sex, race, age, age nationality,
undergraduate program and previ-
ous foreign experience thatreceive
nominations from the participat-
ing institution they attend. Dean
