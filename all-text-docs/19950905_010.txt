POSTCARDS
FROM THE EDGE

We’re still
colonists
to them

By Mary STEPHENS

Guest Writer

. Pll offer one caveat to anyone
planning on traveling through En-
gland during the Fourth of July
weekend: we are still, and may
always be, the colonists to them.
There’s nothing quite like seeing a
group of 30 bungling Davidson
College students wandering the
streets of Cambridge all clad in
. Americana paraphernalia, one of
whom is trailing a stars ‘n stripes
windsock from his collar and an-
other who is passing out red, white,
and blue cocktail napkins to every-
one.

And there’s something egre-
giously wrong with downing large
amounts of Budweiser and taking
shots of Jack Daniels while in a
country that prides itself on its
very warm and very flat stouts and
lagers. You can dress us up, but
you can’t take us out and expect us
to remain inconspicuous. Perhaps
the least innocuous moment of the
evening occurred when one mem-
ber of the group decided it was
completely appropriate (it was the
4th) to break out in around of “The
Star Spangled Banner” while still
at the pub. Not unlike whistling
Dixie at a Black Panther gathering,
I imagine. Taking a martini to an
AA meeting might have been sub-
tler.

We had fun, though — more
fun in six weeks than I think most
of the Brits we met had had in a
lifetime of kidney pies and meat
pastries. Hot tea and scones with
clotted cream doth not a party
make! Now that’s something that
should probably stay in England:
scones with clotted cream. Ameri-
cans have enough trouble battling
the lures of Twinkies, Fritoes, and
Dunkin Doughnuts. They would
never be able to market it in the
States because no American has
the patience to go through the pro-
cess of actually making a proper
scone, anyway. If someone could
come up with a way to vacuum
pack a scone with a shelf life of 13
years and get Wal-Mart to sell it,
then maybe they would have a
chance.

The scone, for anyone unsure,
is a sweet, puck-like leaden biscuit
usually speckled with raisins or
nuts upon which one spreads heavy
coats of butter (margarine will not
do). Then a generous helping of
jam is applied, and mounds of the
famous clotted cream (thickly
whipped sweet cream not unlike
the consistency of cellulite itself)
are added creating a strangely de-
licious surprise which has a total

INNO REVERENCE IN GHAPPELL

Comedian leaves ne 900 Room rolling with laughter

‘By GEORDIE SCHIMMEL
Staff Writer

Comedian Katsy Chappell,
five-time-winner of “Star Search”
and actress from _ the
Schwartzenegger film True Lies,
performed in the 900 Room last
Saturday night. Her monologue
included biting social commentary
about appearance, gender queries
into the fundamental differences
between men and women, brief
excursions into various persona,
and a good deal of talk about her
posterior.

She spoke about 5-7-9 shops,
about a larger woman’s angst at
not being welcome in the smaller-
size clothing stores; she spoke
about renting a moped in Hawaii,
and the thin seat sliding deep into
her bowels — not exactly her word;
she spoke of the grotesques at the
DMV — so true, so true. She
touched on just about everything:
race, politics (her “lunar eclipse”
at the traffic light), aging. Even
her impromptu line in the recent
True Lies — “get some for me
while you’re at it.” Everything.

Actually, she dwelled very
much on aging, and specifically its
unpleasant effects on the human
figure — her grandmother’s ever-
lengthening eyebrows, her prob-
lems with gas, and certain other,
less mentionable affairs: “it’s not
from me, these aren’t my secre-
tions.” Of course a handful of her

words.

jokes failed, like the withered, ef-
fete, why-did-she-even-attempt-
this clapper joke, and one might
conclude by the silence following
it that the hen rap failed as well.
But her successes naturally far
outnumbered her flops. Ask any-
one.

Comedians are made or bro-
ken by their wits, by their ability to
handle crowds, and Chappell is no
exception. She denounced those
seated upstairs as freshmen — very
funny — and had no qualms about

deriding anyone within the reach
of her fierce tongue. (Katherine,
you were, of course, an innocent.)
Maybe Chappell’s finest moment
occurred when she dealt with a
sophomore whose name probably
ought to go unmentioned (though
we all know who “‘chakeem”’ is
anyway) Recalling the cunning,
lingual theme ribboning through
her performance, she took the
young man from the audience and
rode the back of his head like a
pony. (It left grease stains, she

complained.) She loved every

minute of it.

To her credit, it is impossible
to recreate Katsy Chappell’s hu-
mor on the page, and I challenge
anyone to do it. She is talented,
focused [focussed?], and undeni-
able. Also to her credit, she made
one unforgivable error early in the
night’s performance: comedy, she
said, is still a man’s game. Fortu-
nately she is wrong. Thanks to the
College Union and BSC for their
sponsorship of this event.

Freshmen find Kindred spirit at Davidson
Students identify with protagonist of freshmen book

By Katie MCALISTER
Staff Writer

In preparation for orientation
into “the Davidson experience,”
the freshman class was asked, as
freshman classes of old, to read a
novel during the summer. Many
greeted the package containing the
dreaded summer reading with
groans of disgust — and shoved it
somewhere in the great abyss un-
der the bed. But as the summer
came to a screeching halt, the in-
coming class of 1999 had to buckle
down and read.

This year’s novel is Kindred,
written by Octavia Butler. The
theme of the book is quite fitting
for the group of wide-eyed stu-
dents — thrown into independence
— to have tucked under their belts
as they enter their first semester of
college. Kindred is the story of
Dana, a young black woman living
in the 1970s, and her journey
through time and space to the ante-
bellum South. Dana, like Davidson
freshmen, is removed without
warning fromall that she has known
and placed without significant
preparation into a world in which
the ideals, customs, and way of life
are foreign to her eyes.

In the “new” world of the past,

Dana encounters Rufus Weylin, a

white plantation owner who is also
her ancestor. Throughout the
novel, the reader learns of Dana’s
feelings of being caught between
the two worlds. She no longer
feels at home in the present, and
she finds erie comfort in returning
to the horrific reality of life on a
plantation.

The theme of Kindred was
presented to the freshmen during
orientation through large and small
discussion groups as well as
through a dramatic interpretation.
Sophomore Adrienne Nixon and
junior Jared Govan brought Kin-
dred to life through a presentation
of two scenes from the novel (and
for those freshmen who did not
find time during the summer to
read the novel, the presentation
was a necessary addition to an un-
derstanding of the theme).

The scenes chosen for presen-
tation were representative of the
basic idea of the novel. Following
each scene, the house lights were
raised, and the freshmen were given
an opportunity to voice their feel-
ings about the novel, and their re-
actions to the dramatic presenta-
tion. Through the many chances

for discussion of the novel — in -

small and large groups — all were

afforded the chance to soak in the
opinions and interpretations of
peers, upperclassmen, and faculty
members.

Perhaps the scene in the novel
which freshman can best relate to
comes at the close of the novel.
Dana has made her final journey
through time to the antebellum
South and to the plantation of her
ancestors. After a dramatic termi-
nal confrontation with Rufus, Dana
is cast back into the twenty-first
century. In her own words, “I was

back at home — in my house, in
my own time. ButI was still caught
somehow, joined to the wall as
though my arm were growing out -
or growing in to it.”

Just as Dana, freshmen gaze
out into a new horizon, a world of
new experiences and opportuni-
ties. Yet we are caught between all
that we have come to know in the
past 18 years of life and all that we
are destined to learn in the next
four years as members of the

Davidson family.
