Davidson Approves Gender
Studies Concentration

By LIZ YAREMA

Students interested in “focus-
ing on the significance of sex as a
social construct” should be excited
about Davidson’s new concentra-
tion in Gender Studies. As its state-
ment of purpose touches upon, the
concentration expects that by rec-
ognizing gender as an empirical
reality it will stimulate fresh intel-

Our ultimate goal is to
have issues of gender
woven throughout the
curriculum and not just
in specially designated
courses.

Iectual curiosity and provide new
approaches in  interdisciplinary
rescarch.

The concentration is open to
all juniors, sophomores and first-
year students as well as to any
seniors who think they may beable
to qualify in time. Men especially
are encouraged to sign up. Profes-
sor of Political Science and chair
of the Gender Studies advisory
committee Mary C. Thornberry
says that a large part of the reason
the concentration is called Gender
Studies is to let men know that they
are welcome and that the courses
are appropriate for them as well.

Dr. Thornberry hopes the con-

centration will help people realize
that gender issues are a part of
every discipline--that they apply
to biology and physics as well as to
English and history, to political
science and economics as well as
to religion and anthropology.

“Our ultimate goal,” Dr.
Thornberry says, “is to have issues
of gender woven throughout the
curriculum and not just in spe-
cially designated courses.”

For now though, the concen-
tration offers students a wide vari-
ety of “specially designated” top-
ics from which to choose. “The
courses were already in the cur-
riculum,” professor of English
Elizabeth Mills says. “The con-
centration gives students credit for
work they already have been
doing.”

There are some new courses
which have been added as well.
The committee attributes these
additions and the existence of the
concentration itself to ever increas-
ing scholarship in the field, in text
materials, in student demands and,
most importantly, in faculty inter-
est and support.

The concentration is not solely
an academic endeavor, however.
Its. long term goal is to “help
Davidson men and women func-
tion freely and fairly in the world.”
As professor of History Sally
McMillen explains, “We want to
create a forum for and raise aware-
ness of related issues.” The com-
mittee hopes students, in true lib-
eral arts fashion, will then transfer
their heightened sensitivity to other
aspects and interests in their lives.

“I came to Davidson having
been involved with the planning of
the next campaign for Harvard
University,” Whisnant said, “and
as I have talked to the leaders of
the Campaign for Davidson, both

I have come to find out that from

New Dining Option:
Go Underground

COLLEGE RELATIONS

Davidson has unearthed a
new trend in light lunching -
going “underground” with the
Baker Underground in Baker
Sports Complex. Marked by a
blue-neon lighted sign, Under-
ground is amini-cafeteria serv-
ing a variety of healthy edibles
suchas sandwiches, fruitjuices,
fresh fruits and salads, sports
drinks and home-baked cook-
ies. .

The idea of dining in Baker
was the brainchild of Athletics
Director Terry Holland and his
assistant, Bob Price. They hope
to generate more traffic in the
complex, as well as accommo-
date the nearly 50 employees
who work in the building and
others who use the facilities
during the day. Baker Under-
ground is currently open from
noonto2 p.m., Monday through
Friday.

“So far things have been
really going well,” said Becky

Braddock, who is the Under- .

ground’s one- person work
force.

Every day the Underground
offers a different sandwich of
the day, such as_ barbecue,
chicken salad or turkey cheese
pita.

Bob brown, assistant foot-
ball coach, ‘said that the con-
venience of not having to walk
to the Commons or to the Cafe
for lunch should attract the
lunchtime workout crowd.

Professor Shaw Smith said as he
spoke in French with an exchange
student and munched on salad
greens, crispcut broccoli and fresh
melon.

Tom. Gattiker, manager. of
special projects for the dining serv-
ices, says he hope the hours will
later encompass breakfast. Other
upcoming changes include the
addition of the Cat Card Service.

activities offered at Davidson, the
local chapter of the North Carolina
Student Legislature is rarely dis-
cussed. This state-wide organiza-
tion has been active at Davidson
off and on since the 1940s. After a
recent period of dormancy, the
group reactivated in the spring of
1989,

The NCSL is often referred to
as the college’s debate club, but it
entails much more than just argu-
ment. Interested students experi-
ence first-hand the political and
legislative procedures of a model
General Assembly. More impor-
tantly, the members are offered a
forum for expressing theif con-
cerns and ideas about current is-
sues to state and national leaders.
Resolutions passed by NCSL are
passed along to state lawmakers

who then decide the best course of

“Students can really have an im-
pact.”

The NCSL meets once a ior
to discuss and debate the resolu-
tions they intend to pass on to the
North Carolina Legislature. This
month, the Davidson and Queens
Delegations will host a meeting at
Davidson during the weekend of
October 20-21 in Love Audito-
rium, Between 100 and 150 stu-
dents from 26 schools from the far
reaches of the state of North Caro-
lina will be in attendance. The
main debate sessions will be on

Saturday Oct. 20 from 1 p.m. to»

5:30 p.m.and Sunday Oct. 21 from
10:30 a.m to 4 p.m. Students are
welcome and are encouraged to
attend the debates. Hot topics of
dispute this month are: the ques-
tion of a state-wide lottery, the
repeal of the state’s spousal rape

in North Carolina, and a proposal
to sell $200 million worth of bonds
to finance an expansion of the North
Carolina prison system, There
should be plenty of hard-hitting
debate action.

Come out and show your sup-
port for the Davidson Delegation
this weekend. Or better yet, for
those of you interested in legisla-
tion or voicing your views, get
involved with NCSL. Besides the
fun of travel and having your opin-
ions heard by students all over the
state, NCSL can be a good step-
ping stone in starting a political
career--North Carolina Governor
