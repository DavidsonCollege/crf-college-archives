the davidsonian

Student symposium to view

national education problems

A bi-annual student sympo-
sium is being organized at

Davidson College which will ,

deal with specific national
educational problems.

Each symposium will bring
together fifteen college stu-
dents and fifteen college ad-
ministrators from
Southeastern states in a joint
effort to review, evaluate and
submit feasible solutions to
particular educational prob-
lems.

The symposium will
attempt to provide solutions
to a broad range of problems
that generally interest indivi-
dual students while also
giving educators, business-
men and government officials
a profile of specific collegiate
educational problems and
their possible solutions.

But the stress of the project
is on allowing college students
the opportunity to provide an

input into solving educational
problems which are of a vital
interest to members of this
peer group.

Two groups will be respon-
sible for the project. Collegiate
Publications, Inc., a non-pro-
fit corporation based in Lake
City, Florida, will be respon-
sible for acquiring and allo-
cating the funds for the pro-
ject and publicizing the results
of each symposium.

Collegiate Symposium, a
student organization to be
established at Davidson Col-
lege, will be responsible for
acquiring and allocating the
funds for the project and
publicizing the results of each
symposium.

Collegiate Symposium, a
student organization to be
established at Davidson Col-
lege, will organize and conduct
each symposium.

put to work the very first day
organizing Fall Convocation
and the Trustees’ Octover
meeting,” said Clark.

Spencer stressed that
Clark’s appointment is a ten
month internship. ‘‘I don’t
encourage people|to stay on
because I want someone close
to the students. I do not
believe the creation of a per-
manent job would serve this
purpose,”’ he said.

‘‘Also, the law of dimi-
nishing returns operates on
this job. There is a lot to learn
the first year, but after that a
person’s education could bet-
ter be continued doing some-
thing else,”’ said Spencer.

‘*Dr. Spencer is right in

\

Clark to assist

choosing someone new each
year for the job,” said Love.

“Tt is valuable to change
places from student to admini-
strator. I can appreciate Dav-
idson more after this year. But
the second time around many
of the duties would become
routine and tedious,’”’ he con-
cluded. ‘‘This job is purely
temporary,’’ said Clark. I
hope to defer my acceptance of
admission until September
1977 and enter Law school
then.

“I enjoy Davidson and the

people here, and believe that

without academic pressure
I'll have more time to contri-
bute to the school and take
advantage of many of its
opportunities,’’ he said.

Symposium will also meet
with the Education Commit-
tees of the U.S. Senate and the
House of Representatives and
other national educational
organizations following each
symposium to further the goal
of producing positive action
toward solving the educational
problems discussed.
Students interested in
working with Collegiate

fall term of 1976 should con-

Bernhardt said that while

many do not realize many of

“Then, when they get out and
the school needs their help,

“It’s really aggravating, be-

they could possibly be asked

many students do not realize
that their education is sup-
ported by alumni gifts.

‘‘When you are here, you
don’t realize there are alumni
out there, from people in their
late 70’s to people who grad-
uated last year, who contri-
bute to the college because
they believe so strongly in the
Davidson experience.

“When you get out, I think
it’s your responsibility to take
care of those people behind
you, just like you were taken
care of when you were here,”
said Bernhardt.

Guest house due
for May finishing

By BILL BARNES

The renovation of the Car-
negie building and its conver-
sion into a collegeguest house
will be completed by early
May.

Carnegie building will func-
tion primarily as a guest house
for visiting Trustees, Alumni,
and friends of the college,
indicated College Business
Manager Robert A. Currie.
The building’s basement,
however, will continued to be
used as a dormitory. The
entire building will not be
converted into a student living
space in the near future.

The renovation has included
building eight guest bedrooms
in Carnegie building, as well
as bathrooms for each of these
rooms, a modern kitchen, and
complete repainting and re-
carpeting.

The building has been
waterproofed and the outside
bricking has been cleaned in

- order to clean up its appear-—

ance.
According to Curry the

building will not provide com-
pletely for guest housing at
certain times during the year.

It will be supplemented by
the present VIP house and
possibly by a motel built on
college-owned property which
borders on I-77.

Currie indicates that no
offers have been received for
the land close to I-77, but he
hopes to have a “‘first-class’”’
motel there in the future. He
said that this would alleviate
any guest overflow consider-
ably and forestall any diffi-
culty guests might encounter
finding motels in Statesville or
Charlotte.

athletic programs. Many
alumni, when asked to contri-
bute, have responded only
with contributions to the
Wildcat Club, which is con-
nected with athletic funding.

“All they (the alumni) want
to talk about is the basketball
coach or the football program.
And you say, ‘wouldn’t you
like to make a contribution to
the Annual Fund?’

““Heck no,’ they say, ‘all I
want to contribute to is the
Wildcat Club. My interest is
athletics.’ It’s very frust-
rating, because I feel like they
are being very narrow-
minded,’’ said Bernhardt.

‘‘The school has got to be
more important than the
athletic program. It’s impor-
tant, but not more important
than any other part of the
school.

“And athletics, in my mind,
are less important than aca-
demics,” said Bernhardt.
