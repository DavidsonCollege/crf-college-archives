the debt.

cent of the student body were in fra-
ternities.

That the foundation and pillar stones
in the Old Chambers Building were
quarried at Mt*Mourne, at Lover’s Leap
on the Concord Road, and the Rocky
River community.

That one night a student climbed to
the comb of the south wing of Chamb-
ers, tied a wire to the bell, passed it over
the roof and fastened it to a limb of a
tree. The wire could not be seen and the
bell rang all night.

That immediately after the Civil War
there was a branch of the Ku Klux,Klan
in Davidson, made up of students and
the clerks in the village stores.

That for a long while there were a
large number of vacant rooms in Chamb-
ers and that the students would place a
light in these rooms. When the faculty
inspector knocked to see if the student
was studying, and received no answer,
he would naturally open the door and
enter. A carefully balanced bucket of
water would be his welcome.

The Moo Cow Quartet appeared in the ap- |

performers were spared.

“A Sophoclean Drama,” presented by Bob
Walker, J. H. Hall and M. L. Carrol was |
preceded by a wrestling match between Pat- |
terson and Lindamood. |

The evening ended with Caesar’s own |
queen, Cleopatra, dancing “The Dance of the
Seven Veils.” The Emperor himself was
carried away by the beauty of her movements
and called for his renowned fiddle. His
performance capped the evening frolic.
