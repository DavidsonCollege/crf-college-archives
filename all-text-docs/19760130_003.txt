Baskin presents programs,

seeks greater orie

By STEVEN BELL
Staff Writer

SGA President Bo Baskin
presented his ‘‘Winter Agen-
da,’’ the program of SGA
projects for the next few
months, at the Senate meeting
Tuesday night. On the list are
an evaluation of coeducation,
another attempt to initiate
night exams, establishment of
student exchange programs
with other colleges, and fund-
ing for five-days-a-week
psychological counseling.

“The main thing I’d like to
see is an orientation for pro-

jects in the Senate, with
specified goals and deadlines,’’
said Baskin. ‘‘I hope to see
more teamwork in the Senate,
with less factionalism. And I
also plan to pull in some
people from outside the Senate
to work on these things.’’

Baskin also reported that
it appears unlikely the pro-
posed student Bill of Rights

will be approved by the Trust- _

ees at their meeting in late
February. The section of the
Bill which guarantees a stu-
dent media free from censor-

ship has run into some opposi-.

tion among some of the trust-

ntation

ees, and a compromise has yet
to be reached. “

“TF would say it is unlikely
that we can work this out in
time for approval at the Trust-

ees’ meeting,’’ said Baskin.

‘‘Even if we. can reach a
compromise soon, there are
still a number of hurdles to be
crossed: Governance Commit-
tee approval, faculty appro-

‘val, and Senate approval.”

‘‘We could take it in a
piecemeal fashion, submitting
all of the Bill except for the
media section, to the Trustees
in February. But that is not
our inclination,’’ he pointed
out.

Ali suggests that the in-
crease in oil prices has come
about because the Organiza-
tion of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) of the Mid-
dle East supplies so much of
the world’s oil.

‘‘The Middle East has 76
percent of the existing oil
reserves in the non-communist
world and produces 46 percent
of the oil used. When they
control that big a source, they
are able to use it to gain
political and economic posi-
tion,’’ said Ali.

“The increases in 1973 were
for political reasons, the in-
creases more recently have
been to improve economic
situation.”

Ali pointed out that many
critics of American oil com-

“Nixon thought he could
get away with it.”

Miller, who is in the process
of writing a similar biography
of Lyndon B. Johnson, denied
that he had any plans to write
a Nixon biography.

“There isn’t the remotest
chance of me writing a Nixon

would like to, unléss you get

panies claim that the ‘‘oil
sovereignity’’ which the
OPEC nations now enjoy
could have been avoided if
American interests had looked
for oil in other places- during
the 1960’s.

“Many critics believe that
oil companies deliberately
manipulated and created the
oil crisis in 1974. They argued
that oil companies had failed
to develop oil resources all
over the world, as they are
doing now.

“Tf oil companies had looked
in the 50’s or 60’s they would
have found oil all over the
world. They concentrated on
Middle East oil because it was
so cheap in the 50’s, 15 or 16
cents a barrel,’ said Ali, who
believes that the powerful
OPEC may disentegrate soon.

Miller attended the Univer-
sity of Iowa, but never re-
ceived a degree due to ‘‘a
pronounced disinclination to
comply with the school’s re-
quirements for military train-
ing.” i

During the McCarthy era,
Miller was publicly blacklisted
for his outspoken social com-
ments.
