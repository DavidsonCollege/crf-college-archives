THE DAVIDSONIAN, April 22, 1920.

DEVOTIONAL

THE OLD GIVES WAY
TO THE NEW AT “Y”
VESPER SERVICE

Interesting Talks Made by Mr.
Miles, Chalmers and Schenck.

The meeting of the “Y” Sunday
evening marked the transition from
the old officers and cabinet to the
new ones.

Mr. Miles asked both the old and
new cabinets to sit near the front
that all might see them. He said
that the work of the “Y” depended
on the whole student body and not
merely on the president and his cabi-
net. The Davidson spirit is due to
the Christian men on the campus.

Chalmers, the retiring president,
reviewed the work of the “Y” for
the past year. He said the work of
the “Y” had been a success if orie
man had been brought into a more
devoted Christian. living. He ex-
-pressed his thanks to Mr. Miles and
the cabinet, “Buck” Currie and the
orchestra, and finally to the whole
student body for its co-operation. In
closing, Chalmers asked that the
new officers and cabinet carry to
completion the unfinished plans of
the retiring officers.

Schenck, the new president, said
it was useless to say anything about
the splendid work of Mr. Miles and
Chalmers because the work stood
out for them. He set for the goal
for the coming year “Every man to
know Christ intimately.”

Y. M. C. A. CABINETS HOLD
DELIGHTFUL LUNCHEON

Plans Discussed for Coming Year.
New Cabinet Announced.

One of the most pleasant social
events of the past week was the
luncheon given at Mrs. White’s on
Thursday evening to a joint meeting
of the old and new Y. M. C. A. cabi-
nets. Practically all of the members
of both the retiring and incoming
cabinets were present, and the
events of the evening proved very
profitable to both. Many valuable
suggestions were given the new
men concerning the various tasks
they are now about to enter upon. |

Short, forceful talks were then
made as follows:

Dwight Chalmers brought for-
ward a few suggestions from this
year’s president, and urged that the

new. cabinet interest every man on.

the campus in some form of “Y”
work.

Lewis Schenck then paid a splen-
did tribute to the record of the “Y”
this year, and to the work of Mr.
Miles and Chalmers, speaking also
of the goal of the “Y,” and of the
personal preparation of every man
for service.

Askew then reviewed the financial
condition of the “Y,” and also gave
valuable suggestions for the work
next year.

The trials, tribulations and oppor-
tunities of the Bible Study chair-
man was the subject very ably dis-
cussed by L. L. McAlister.

C. J. Matthews then told how he
had been able tq secure Governor
Bickett and other noted speakers
for this year, and how this work
could be carried even further next
year.

The program was concluded by a
short talk from Mr. Miles. he
plans of the new cabinet were out-
lined, and every man present was
urged to go to Blue Bidge. The
members o f the new cabinet are:

Dave Roberts, Devotional.

VOLUNTEER BAND.

The Volunteer Band is growing
rapidly. Sunday night the band held
one of its largest meetings since
outgrowing the former meeting
room in the library. If the rate of
the appearance of new faces con-
tinues as at present the band will
have to seek still larger quarters.

J. P. Price, who was one of North
Carolina’s delegates to the Student

Don't Forget to

met in New York City, made an in-
teresting and inspiring talk about
his trip.

The members of the band pledged
themselves to stand behind the na- |
tion-wide finance drive in the inter-
est of the Volunteer Movement.

S. W. Dick was then unanimously
elected treasurer of the band. Dur-
ing the absence of Dave Roberts, the
vice-president has taken charge and
is running things in fine shape.

After quite a bit of discussion,
next Friday night was the time set
at which a feed would be held at the
Gym. The committee in charge is
composed of Sullivan, Harrell and
Hunter. The time of the “feed” will
be 10 o'clock.

BIBLE CLASSES.

Despite the weakness of man to
crave “Yet a little sleep,” the Bible
classes were well attended last Sun-
day. It seems that Davidson stu-
dents especially are given to the
somber vice of wasting the glories
of early morning in restful sleep.
It is queer that Sunday morning
should be selected by all as the one
day to be given to such a practice.
Nevertheless everyone is to be high-
ly commended for assembling his
body at 10 o’clock—though his mind
remain quite sunken in the feathery
softness of five minutes ago.
