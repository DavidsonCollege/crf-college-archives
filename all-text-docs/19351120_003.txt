week in December, using as his general
subject, “What Christ Means to Me.”

The series will begin at the vesper
service, Sunday, December 1, when Dr.
Speer will talk on “What the Earthly
Life of Christ Means to Me.” He will
again address the student body during
chapel on Monday; his topic will be
“What the Death of Christ Means to
Me.” The third in this series of lectures,
to be at the hour
‘Tuesday, will have as its @tbject, “What
the Resurrection of Christ Means to
Me.” Dr. Speer will the Otts’
Foundation lectures with an address on
“What the Lordship of Christ
to Me.” This will be delivered in chapel
on Wednesday.

Dr. Speer has been secretary of the
Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions
since 1891. He graduated from
Princeton University, where he took an
active part in athletics. He received his
M.A. from Yale, his D.D. from the Uni-

from Rutgers University. In 1927 Dr.
Speer was Moderator of the Presbyte-

time a number of prominent Christians
have continued the addresses. Dr. Speer
follows the original purpose of the lec-
tures by presenting to the students some
