Fall Services

Smart’ Presented Six Sermons
During Series

Fall Services of 1943 came to a
close Thursday night, November 6,
with a communion service following
Dr. W. A. Smart’s final sermon.

Dr. Smart presented six sermons
during his three days on the David-
son campus, speakirfg at chapel each
morning and at 7:15 each evening.
He opened the series Tuesday morn-
ing by discussing the question of the
source of goodness in non-Christ-
ian people, making the point that
all goodness comes from God,- re-
gardless of where it is found. Tues-

day night Dr. Smart spoke on the},

laws of the spirit, giving three fun-
damental-rules necessary to spiritual
growth. In chapel Wednesday
morning he spoke on the relation-
ship of pleasure to religion, his
thought being that all impulses are
God-given and each has its place
in the balanced life. The topic of
sermon Wednesday night was
“Suffering”. In developing — this
theme Dr. Smart said that suffering
is. not always the consequence of
sin, nor is piety always rewarded
with —presperity, supporting this
view with Christ’s promise that all
who follow Him must suffer. The
text used Thursday morning was
“Seek ye first the Kingdom of God”.
The speaker interpreted the word
“first” to mean a place of prime im-
portance, and stated that God should
have such a place in every man’s
life. regardless of his occupation.

In his closing sermon Dr. Smart

Spoke on entering into the suffering
of Christ, and extolled the compas-
sionate heart that is sensative to the
pains of others and can sympathize
with them.

Edgar Patterson, - president of
the Y. M. C. A. said in a statement
to The Davidsonian, “Dr. Smart’s
series of messages served as an ex-
cellent mental and spiritual catalyst
for his hearers. He brought religion
down off the shelf and presented it
in practical terms.”

Church Opens
Building Fund

A campaign ‘for funds to build a
Wew. church on the Davidson Col-
lege campus has been authorized by
the trustees of the college and is
now under way.

The goal the drive
$250,000. Gifts amounting to $50,-
000 have already been received in
that direction. Mr. T. S. Morgan,
who assisted in the securing of funds

set for is

for the new gymnasium, is working
with the college this fall toward the
completion of the campaign.

This campaign will not be —con-
ducted like the gym fund drive last
year. During the latter drive gifts
were widely solicited among alumni
and friends of the college, whereas
the present goal is expected to be
met by large donations.

Dr. J. R. Cunningham, president,
states: “The prediction is that this
year will see an all-time high in the
record of American gifts to philan-
thropic_undertakings.._Many_of the

Jricuds, of Davidson are.anxious...to.

see her equipped in the best pos-
sible way for her service in the post-
war period, It would seem probable
that the providing of funds for the
new church can be secured within
the next few months. There is a
hearty agreement among the people
of the college and community as
well as among the ministers and
leaders of the Church that such a.
structure greatly needed and
should be provided.”

Mr. Jackson told The Davidsonian
that collections on the Gymnasium
Fund have been very satisfactory.
He said that almost $200,000 of the
pledged $260,000 has been collected
either in cash or Government bonds.
