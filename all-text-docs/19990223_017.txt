THE DAVIDSONIAN

By Mike ANDERSON
Sports Editor

The Class of 1999 played their
final game at Belk Arena on Satur-
day and Davidson obliterated
Wofford’s Lady Terriers in the
season’s last regular season contest.

The game offered a microcos-
mic glimpse at the growth of the
-women’s basketball program over
this season, in the context of the four
year careers of Jamie & Kerry Brown
and Jessica Montrella.

On January 18 of this year,
Wofford earned their first confer-
ence victory of the season, handing
Davidson an embarrassing team that
sent the Wildcats into a flat spin over
the ensuing weeks.

“Wofford had a little celebra-
tion after that game,” said Coach
John Filar. “They did nothing to
hide that celebration. That gave usa
little extra incentive, it was some-
thing we didn’t forget. When you
win you Win with class, when you
lose you lose'with class. We kind of
had it rubbed in our noses a little bit,
we had a point to prove today.”

“This is what you hope the last

game of the season is like: It’sa “W,”

your team plays well, your seniors —
play well, and your bench not only —

gets to play, but they get to contrib-
ute,” Filar exclaimed.

Jamie Brown led all scorers
with 16 points, while fellow seniors
Kerry Brown and Montrella added
10 and 7, respectively. Jen O’Brien
creeped to within 5 points of the
career 1000 mark, adding 10 along
with her 4 assists on the day.

Janna Magette came off the
bench to add 9 points, while fellow .
freshmen Kelly Copland and
Bethany Schott came through as big
contributors on the day, combining
for 10 points and 7 rebounds. “We
talked about before the game how
we've got to have a hunger,” said
Filar. “We have to get the boards in.
order to get out and run on them.
Bethany Schott came off and had
four boards in the first half, that was
great.”

High-level defensive intensity
forced 26 Terrier turnovers that
turned into 27 Wildcat points. “Our
defense so many times generates our
offense,” Filar proudly noted.

With the victory, Davidson im-
proved their final conference mark
to 11-7, earning 4" place in the regu-
lar season standings.
