DAVIDSON STUDENTS DO NOT
SELECT FATHERS’ VOCATIONS

“Like father, like son” may be a true
adage in most instances, but it is without
verity when applied to Davidson Col-
lege students, at least insofar as profes-
sions of students and parents are con-
cerned.

Statstics recently compiled by Fred W.
Hengeveld, registrar, show that only a
very small proportion of the students en-
rolled at Davidson College intend to fol-
low the vocations of their fathers, while
the great majority appear averse to
choosing the sameé field as that chosen by
their parents. There is no explanation
for this rather unusual situation con-
tained in the bulletin issued by Mr. Hen-
geveld.

It is known, however, that in a number
of instances, for example, the son of a
lawyer will choose medicine, teaching, or
the ministry for his profession; while the
doctor’s son will choose business, or en-
gineering, or accounting. This is not al-
ways the case, records showing that in

. Some instances the son selects the same
vocation as his parent. This is more oft-
en the case in business, where a student
chooses to prepare for the same enter-
prise as his father.

Authorities on eugenics may be able to
explain why there are 106 students pre-
paring themselves for medicine at David-
son, when there are only 32 parents in
this particular field; why 81 undergrad-
uates will follow the Ministry, when there
are only 60 fathers in this profession; why
there are 51 pre-legal students and only
20 lawyer parents; why 24 Davidson boys
are ambitious to be engineers when only
four parents are following this occupa-
tion,

Qther comparisons of this nature might
include: Ninety-nine students prepar-
ing themselves for business as com-
pared with 187 parents already in that
field; nine medical missionaries as com-
pared with two parents already following
that profession; seven embryo journal-
ists as compared with three parents who
are members of the “fourth estate;” and
only four students interested in farming

Rifle Team Matched
AgainstMooresville

Of the four shoots between the David-
son and Mooresville Rifle Teams, three
have been held, the third being encount-
ered on last Tuesday night. So far,
Freize, of the Mooresville team, holds
the honor of being the high scorer. He
scored 188 points out of a possible 200
from four different positions, prone, sit-
ting, kneeling and standing.

The members of the Rifle Team are
training vigorously for the final shoot to
be held on next Tuesday night, at which
time the Davidson Team hopes to surpass
the record made by Freize, at the last
shoot. This is merely a preliminary
match with Mooresville, held:as an open-
season practice match.

On December 5, a rifle match will be
open to all the members of the R. O. T.
C. battalion, Davidson. A trophy will be
awarded by the Scabbard and Blade Fra-
ternity. All the members of R. O, T, C.
are eligible to compete in the match.

althought there are 73 sons of farmers in
college.

As far as records are available, there
appears to be no sons of chemists at Da-
vidson, yet there are nine students in
the college who hope some day to make
their mark in chemical research, There
is not a single accountant ‘among the
listed parents of Davidson students, and
yet eight of the undergraduates will en-
ter this field of endeavor. .One hundred
and nine students failed to state the pro-
fessions of their fathers, and one hun-
dred and seventy-five failed to. express
any preference of vocation for them-
selves. It is generally believed that the
majority of the latter group will eventual-
ly drift into business.

Plumtree Bo
Scholarships

As was recently announced the money
;donated during this year’s mission cam-
,paign conducted by the local Y. M. C.
A., will be to the home mission institu-
tions at Banner Elk, N. C. This sum,
has, during the past years amounted to
about $1,000, will be used to give scholar-
ships to the boys at the Plumtrge Boys’
School.

Some of the more fortunate boys, it is
said, have been able to raise enough
money to defray expenses at the school,
but there are others who have not been
able to do this. The cost for one year at
this institution is $150 and the “Y” will
give to whatever boys may need help
the sum of $50 in order that they may
get the opportunity of an education. The
$1,000 will in this way enable about 20
boys, who, without help, would not be
able to go to school, to get an education.

The Plumtree institution already has a
very efficient and capable force of teach-
ers and a well-equipped plant, so that
all funds will be used for scholarships and
none will go for equipment.

The mission campaign, as announced
by “Y” officials will in all probability
get under way next week.

that it is the only one 6f its kind that is
known to exist anywhere in ‘the United
States.

An association of this sort, it is said, will
greatly facilitate news-gathering, but the
greatest benefit from it will come in the
form of the influence that the best thoughts
and ideas from one college will have on the

campuses of the others in the state.

Deputation Tells.
of Need in Orient

A deputation, composed of John Brad-
ley, John Preston, and Glenn Fry, was
sent to Blacksburg, S. C., last Sunday
by the Volunteer Group.

Their first meeting was held at the
Ramah Church during the regular morn-
ing service. Talks were made on the
history, the past conditions, and the
present needs of various countries in the
Orient. John Bradley talked about the
conditions in China; John Preston spoke
about those in Korea, and Glenn Fry told
about Japan. * As Bradley has lived in
China and Preston in Korea, they were
able to tell of conditions as they had seen
them,

As six o'clock in the evening, they held
a similar service at the meeting of the
