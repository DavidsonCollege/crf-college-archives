JOE BLACK

A Study: Burlap Sack
And Stick With Nail

By BOB PHILLIPS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

May be you know Joe. He is the colored man you
usually see with a burlap sack hung over his shoulder
and a stick with a nail in one end in his hand. Joe picks
up paper and trash off the college grounds.

One of the best ideas they
could do...

“Why?”

“I’m telling you the best I
know how. You know how a
fella who didn't finish school
can’t answer these questions
like somebody that has. I do my
best, and I think I get along
pretty well for a man who
didn’t finish school.”

Military Will Fele
Annual Winter Ball

The Second Annual Military
Ball, sponsored by Scabbard
and Blade, national honorary
military fraternity, will be held
on February 27. The Ball will
be at the Charlotte Women’s
Club from nine to midnight.

The feature of the evening
will be the selection of an Hon-
orary Cadet Colonel from the
dates of Scabbard and Blade
members. The Honorary Cadet
Colonel will then be presented
by -Lt. Col, W. A. Adams, Jr.,
Davidson College PMS&T, in a
special figure.

Col. Adams will- escort the
Honorary Cadet Colonel through
an archway formed by Scabbard
and” Blade members holding
Sabres, which were lent to the
Davidson College Scabbard and
Blade by Clemson College.

He was very cordial to me, and
he seems to get along well with
his colleagues. They appear to
like Joe.

He was working in the new
science building wearing his
usual blue demin coveralls and
untidy greenish shirt, but he
was without. his burlap sack

“How long have you been
working at Davidson, Joe?”

‘Well, I got my ten and fif-

my twenty year pin. They give
us pins every five years.”

“Have you lived in Davidson

“Pm for it,” I said.

Then he looked away. “Yeah,

gleam in his pink eye.

“How curious!"

tl. ALICE’S EVIDENCE

The next morning Alice|’
awoke to find herself upon the
wooded hil! again. She was
alone, and she felt terribly
queer.

“Oh!” she cried. “I feel as is
there’s not enough left of me
to make ONE respectable per-
son!” She sat up and looked
about curiously.

Soon her eye fell on a little
box that was lying nearby.
She picked it up and read
upon it the words, “EAT
ME”, and beneath, in smail-
er letters, “A combination of
ingredients. Will not upset
your stomach.”

“Well, I'll eat it,” said Alice.
“I scarcely care what happens,

I feel so queer.”

She opened the box, popped
the Httle pill inside into her
mouth.

Something curious began to
-happen.

“Curlouser and curiousert”
she cried, “Now | am opening
out like the largest telescope
that ever was! Good-bye,
feet!” For suddenly, when
she tooked she could not see
her feet at all. And still she
grew — more and more and
more.

Alice sat down. .

“How horrid!" she thought.
“Whatever could have happen-
ed?”

In the silence of the wood, no
answer came. . . only the chirp.
ing of occasional birds.

And then she heard it. A
muffled laugh rose from deep
in the brush, and the sound of
running feet.

That horrid rabbit.

Alice began to cry.
