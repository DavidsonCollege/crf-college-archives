Congratulations... .

The annual Y.M.C.A. Christmas Gift
Fund has been over-subscribed this year
and congratulations go to Bill Mclean
and Joe Stukes, chairman of the drive,
in the magnificient job they have done
this year in leading the drive to victory.

Not to be overlooked, however is the
cooperation extended by the members of
the student body. Through their genero-
sity, the fifteen hundred dollar goal was
met and over-subscribed by more than six
hundred dollars, ffl

Unique among college traditions, the
“Y” Gift Fund was established at David-
son many years ago and serves to bring
the students and faculty together at each
Christmas season in a cooperative effort
for some worthy cause. The fund this
year will be used to rebuild the Presbyter-
ian Mission at Suchowfu Province, China
which was totally destroyed by the Japa-
nese.

Dr. Frank A Brower Sr., a former
member of the Suchowfu Mission and
Peking and served more than 2000 na-
sion was bombed out early in the war and
temporarily pastor of a church in Norton,
Va., spoke in chapel last week on the
strategic importance of this facility which
is located midway between Shanghai and
Peking and served more htan 2000 na-
tives. Located at the intersection of two
main trunk lines only one hundred and
fifty miles from the Yellow Sea, the Mis-
sion was bombe dout early in the war and
had to be abandoned.

Cangratulations also go to the members
of the student bedy who reside on the
first floor of West dormitory, for theirs
was the larges tamount contributed by
any one floor in the college.

A glance at the Gift Funds of past
years shows increasing interest and sup-
port by the students from year to year.
In 1941 more than ~-1600.00 was con-
tributed for the purchase of Bibles for
members of our armed forces, and for
prisoners of war. In 1942 the studénts
gave $2000.00 for the Christian educa-
tion of southern negroes. Year before last
the $1400.00 donated went to medical re-
lief in China. Last year members of the

small student body radically reduced by
the war averaged $6.65 per student for
the furnishing of a Student Room in the
proposed new campus church, to be a

memorial to the 139 Davidson alumni

who have made the supreme sacrifice in

World War II.

The new thermometer which registered
1500 degrees prove insufficient in meet-
ing the heat wave which swept through
here last week, but no one cared about
that, for they realized where their small

funds contributd were going and what “

they would mean to some poor folk on
the other side of the world whom they
will probably never see.

Congratulations again, Joe, for a job
well done.

A Merry Christmas .. .

The Christmas season is here again,
and ina few days we will be going home
to spend the glorious holidays with our
parents and friends.

Christmas has been in the air at Dav-
idson for some time now. But only until
we began singingt-Christmas carols’ in
chapel and until the beautiful rendition
of the Messiah was performed here did
we really secure the sense of Christmas
in our hearts and minds. We hope every-
one heard the Messiah here last Mon-
day evening, and if you didn’t you have
missed hearing some of the most beau-
tiful music ever written. Handel certain-
ly must have been inspired when he set
the beautiful Hallellujah Chorus into
music writing, for that itself is enough
to arouse our inner heart to one of thanks-
giving and joyfulness.

For the first time in four years the
lights will go on again.
American home will be brighten by the re-
turn of service men everywhere. It will
be a happy one for them as they sit by
the big open fire on Christmas morning,
resting comfortably, the lighted tree in
all its glory in the corner of the room,
the presents underneath, but amidst all
of this let us not forget those who will
never.return ,those who have given their
lives, so that you and I might continue
to enjoy the freedom and democracy
which our forefathers fought and died
to give us.

During the Christmas season let us
not forget to pause and recall just exactly
what Christmas means and why we cele-
brate it. or it means exactly nothing for
those who fail to do that. It goes deeper
than merely the decorating of a cedar, or
the exchanging of gifts, or the eating of
a turkey dinner, Christmas means the
birth of our Lord and let’s not forget that
December 25.

Very shortly a new year will be here
and time for us to begin anew. Let us re-
dedicate ourselves and fulfil each an
every resolution.

This will be the last edition of the Da-
vidsonian betore the new year, ard so,
speaking for the editorial and business
staff, we bid you a very Merry Christ-
mas and a happy new year

And many an:

Beta Theta Pi

Beta “doings” before the holi-
days include the annual “Christmas
Tree” party Friday night—strickly
stag, and then on Saturday night
a dinner dance at the Guest House.
Several alumni and old brothers
are expected, Seven Betas attended
the Quarterback Club’s banquet at
Charlotte last, week. Rapp and Sher-
rill called their own signals after
the banquet.

With the Shrine Bowl game in
Charlotte most of the big operating
was done in the Queen City. al-
though Gunn ventured as far as
Salem.

Ist. Lt. Morton Church of Char-
lotte visited the chapter on Decem-
ber 5th, and on the “9th Brother
Jim McCrary was on the campus.

We understand that Joe McLean
has been beating “ Termite’s” time.

We join. all the other Greeks
and Davidsonians to wish one and
all a Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year.

Sigma Phi Epsilon

It seems as though a great major-
ity of the Sig Eps went to the
Shrine Bowl game in Charlotte.
During the first half, you could
have seen many of them standing
at the rear of the crowd. One said
the best show was behind the crowd.

What happened to ‘the Sig Ep
pledges last week end. Earl Myers,
Meredith Davison, Albert Correll,
and Andy Gullick stayed at David-
son.

Z. Holler is happy now. Kather-
ine wil be here from December 13
to December 18. Must be wonderful.

It must be true love for Dave
this time. It has been going on for
months and he goes home so often.

As this goes to press, plans are
under way for a gala Christmas
party with girls at the Sig Ep
house on December 15. The pledges
are to decorate for the affair.
There'll be a Christmas tree, holly,
and, of course, mistletoe.

On December 7, Sandy Shaw was
initiated into Sigma Phi Epsilon
Fraternity. Our only regret is that
we will probably lose him to the
armed forces eat the end of this
semester.

Pi Kappa Phi.

The Pi Kapps are certainly plan-
ning to pitch a big one Monday
evening, when they have their an-
nual Christmas party. You should
be there when they exchange gifts
—brother, what, gifts! (Hope there
aren't any girls there, but there will
be).

Happy to welcome Bill Robert-
son back to school, after two years
in the service. Kinda hard to get
back into the ole study groove,
isn't ity Bill. Incidently, who was
that gal in Texas, and what about
the one in Durham? (Also at W. C.
—what a man, that Bill!).

What did Palles go to Charlotte
for the other night? .. And where
does Pete go every-week-end? . .
Walker hasn’t been’ to Charlotte
lately. Hasn’t she gotten back from
Philidelphia yet, Walt? . . Why is
Jimmy Nisbet staying over here for
several days after holidays begin?
Counldn't be that a certain Kan-

napolis girl will be here too, or
could it, Jim? ... Mel can’t seem

‘to get up enough nerve to date a

certain lab partner. What’s wrong,
Mel? Off of ’em for life?

The Pi Kapps wish each and
every member of the student body
a very merry Christmas and a pro-
perous New Year.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon

Tonight is the big night for the
SAE's, It is then that we throw
function which will be the works.
If all you boys want to see a set
of good lookin’ women just drop
by. You may gét something to eat
also. i

Brother McAlister went to
Greensboto this past week end to
see his one (?) and only(?). It’s
lucky he got back for Monday’s
classes for he may have overcut.
How about it J. Mac?

As for love in the fraternity most
of it is fraternal. This is the score.

ther Strickland, uncertain,—Pledge
Richert, more uncertain—Brother
Miller, most uncertain,

Pi Kappa Alpha

Ted Sumner and Jeff-Wood went
to the show while Bill Cook ate
spaghetti at the Ship Ahoy for three
hours, “Sport” Lafferty and
“Preacher” had quite a week-end
in Concord. . . “Bubble Lips” Coble
stayed on the campus studying as
usual. . . Floyd Furr had a quiet
week-end at home,

Stiles went out toward the Caro-
lina Pines with one arm driving.
Better watch it. . . Dockery, every
girls pin up boy, went to Bitter-
weed for a brand.new T model
ford. . . “Croaner” Hadley went to
Statesville. You ought to see
Bill Neal's latest addition to his
picture gallery. It’s a view of a
firescape. . . “Modly” went for his
biweekly visit to Pat’s Tavern. . .
Page went to Salem. Oh, those
quiet shaded walks, . . Randy and
Lonnie are haying an eggnog party
at Allison's Lake during the Holi-
days, Everybody must bring his own
comfort. L

Kappa Alpha

The KA’s got off to a fine start
in intra-mural basketball by beat-
ing the SAE’S 23-22, Moan and
Choates were the high scorers, but
all would have been lost had it not
been for a sensational set shot
by Bill Wall in the closing second
of the game. Wall very modestly
says that he was saving his superior
qualities until they were needed.

The love-bug has finally smitten
Sam McDaniel, and I do mean smit-
ten. It was love at first sight for
Sam, and we hope the girl realizes
a good catch when she sees one.
By the way, her*name is “Winkie”
—Cute—Blonde—5’ 5"!

Pledge Spillman and Pledge Wall
got kicked out of Queens this past
week-end, and although they won't
give a reason, we believe they walk-
ed out because the girls would not
pay them enough attention.

Pledge Cunningham and Ham-
tick aren’t seen together by any
of the locals anymore. Could there
have been a tif? .
