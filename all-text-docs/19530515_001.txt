Sig Up Initiates;
Has Annual Picnic

Faculty members of Sigma Up-
silon, honorary literary fraternity,
gave their annual supper for all
student members Friday, May 8,
at 6:30 p. m.

The supper, prepared by le grand
chet Dr. Goldiere, consisted of ham-
burgers, cheeseburgers, coffee, and
ice cream; and the place of the
feast was the barbecue pit near
Erwin Lodge.

After the supper, a meeting was
held inside Erwin Lodge; and the
first business was the initiation of
six new members. Those who of-
ficially became members by kissing
the Scarab are Ronnie Wilson, Nor-
man Jobnson, Vereen Bell, Bob
Hayes, Moodie Smith, and Mac
Williamson.

Highlights of the program of
the meeting were two short stories
by John Ottley and Vereen Bell
and an ode to the American farmer,
Frank, who had just completed
a hard day's work, by Shaw Smith,
which was, and we quote, “Frank
stank!”

New officers were also elected,
with the following members win-
ning respective offices: Don Mahy
— President, Alden Williams —
Vice President, Norman Johnson
— Secretary and Treasurer, and at
present there is a struggle between
Moc Bulgin and Dr. Chalmers

is the fruit of his final tour of
duty with AP, at Rome, where he
covered major post-war news is-
sues. He has been writing on his
own since 1949.

The autobiography of Mary T
Martin Sloop, one of the first wom-
en alumnae of Davidson, was pub-
lished this spring. The life of the
famous doctor, who was American
Mother of the Year in 1951, has
been recorded in Miracie in the
Hills. LeGette Blythe, who holds a
D. Lit. from Davidson, assisted Dr.
Sloop in the writing of the book.
Dr. Sloop is the daughter of Col. W.
J. Martin, a former Chemistry Pro-
fessor at Davidson.

A book of poetry, Driftwood, un-
usual for a Davidson man, was re-
leased this year by Thomas Burnett
Swann of the Class of 1950. Born
in Tampa, Florida, Swann attended
Davidson and Duke in his un-
dergraduate work, and is now in
the United States Navy as a per-
sonnel specialist.

Philosophies Men Live Sy came
this year from the pen of Robert
F. Davidson, a Davidson graduate
who has also attended Oxford on
a Rhodes Scholarship and Yale
University, where he received his
Ph. D. in 1937.

Shelby T. McCloy, another
Rhodes Scholar, of the Class of
1918, has written French Inven-
tions of the 18th Century. He is
the author of a number of scholar-
ly works.

Mid-Point for “28, a history of
the Class of 1028 for its Silver An-
niversary which will be this Com-
mencement, was written this year
by Dr. Chalmers Davidson, member
of the present faculty and grad-
uate in the Class of '28.

Other books published during
the course of the year by Davidson
alumni are Double-Teik, a Korean-
English language book by James
Wilson Kerr; History of the Second
Presbyterian Church In Charlotte,

by Robert H. Lafferty of the Class
of 1878; John L. Lewis and the In-
ternational Union by Rex Walton

Herper Handbook of College Com-
position, by Harry Shaw of the
Class of 1926.

DAVIDSON’S PISTOLS

Recently, knowing of no better

them to General Davidson's name-

The two pistols, packed away in
their ancient holsters, now await
an adequate display case in the

that it is very unlikely that the
General wore them when he met

and Tories, after killing the Gen-

and left him naked on the banks
of the Catawba.

The pistols are interesting relics
of the Revolutionary days of the

holster was made to fit a horse
above the saddle, so that they
could easily be reached in emer-

The 1953 Quips and Cranks will
be available to students in the
Green Room of the College Union
beginning at one o'clock Friday

morning and Monday afternoon and
night.

Students and faculty members
are urged to pick up their copies
at these times.

Dedicated to Professor A. G.
Griffin, and with a theme that re-
calls the Davidson of fifty years
ago, the annual this year includes
a number of additional features
over past editions.

Junior’s fraternities are lisited
in that class section, and full names
are used in all class sections, with
the students’ usual names, not ini-
tials, being used in the other sec-
tions.

For the purpose of greater dis-
tinction in membership, no tresh-
men are included in the honoraries
section.

Individual names are stamped in
gold on the covers, and the annual
features an unusual treatment for
inclusion of Who's Who members.

By delaying for a late publica-
tion date, the staff was able to
include spring elections to mem-
bership in Phi Beta Kappa and 0.

Sponsors and beauty queens have

many students as possible in in-
formal pictures and to picture all
fraternities equally.

Sy HUNTER STRADER

The retirement of two of David-
son’s best loved professors, Dr.
Edwin F. Shewmake and Dr. Guy
R. Vowles, was announced to the
board of trustees in February.

The two educators have a com-
bined total of 59 years service to
the college.

Dr. Shewmake, although born in
Minto, North Dakota, has lived in
the South for all but a few weeks
of his childhood.

The ranking faculty member
from point of service, he joined
the English department in 1919
after some ten years experience in
secondary schools.

He received the B.A. degree from
William and Mary in 1908, took
his masters degree at Columbia in
1914, and was awarded the Ph.D.
degree from Virginia in 1920.

Dr. Shewmake's ten years of sec-
ondary teaching included positions
at Newport News High School, Nor-

of the local high school.

He is the author of numerous
books and articles including “Col-
lege English Composition”, “Eng-
lish Pronunciation in Eastern Vir-
ginia”, “Literature Notebook”,
“Standards and Tendencies in
American Speech”, “On Class”,
“Poetry in Pyblic Worship”, “The
Race Question and Southern
Youth”, and others.

Dr. Shewmake married the form-
er Cornelia Margaret Switzer in

Alpha Epsilon Delta, honorary
pre-medical fraternity, concluded
its yearly activities on Wednesday
night with the initiation of new
members, Jim Hamilton, Charlie
Hassell, Jim Faires, and Lee Scott.

These men, all rising seniors,
have attained an average of B or
better in their science courses as
well as in their aggragate average.

Under the leadership of presi-
dent Bob Poston, AED has pre-

favor of a plan to coincide with
orientation, the amount of opposi-
tion to the plan rendered it un-
wise at the present time.

As in the past, three rush dates
will be held each night beginning
at 7:00, 8:00, and 9:00 o’clock 1nd
lasting for one hour. In addition
to these, two one hour dates will
be held Wednesday afternoon be-
ginning at 3:30 and 4:30. Formal
pledging will take place Saturday

sented a number of series and lec-
tures which, although primarily of-
fered for pre-medical students,
have proved to be in some cases
of general interest to the entire
student body.

The film probably receiving the
largest attendance was a techni-
color production featuring the de-
but of four real babes, quadru-
plets by Caesarean section. On two
other occasions films were shown,
one on the functioning of the arti-
ficial kidney and the other on ul-
cers of the gastro-intestinal tract.

The latter film was accompanied
by a lecture by Dr. Gunn in which
he illustrated the manner in which
a physician could use knowledge
gained from pre-med courses in
diagnosing such cases.

One of the greatest aids to David-
son students who are interested in
entering medical schools is the an-
nual program sponsored by AED
through which the deans of ad-
mission of the three North Caro-
lina medical schools visit Davidson.

Students are thus afforded the
opportunity of meeting and talking
with the men who may later be
judging their ability to successful-
ly enter the field of medicine.

In addition such a program lends
ircite into the very nature of med-
ical schools, their similarities and
differences, their general require-
mepts, and the methods they use
in evaluating applicants. During

this semester Dr. J. E. Markee of

The Interfraternity Council ex-
pressed its appreciation to the fra-
ternities for considering at length
the proposals raised in the past -
week or ten days. A spokesman for
the Council also urged every fra-
ternity man on the campus to
familiarize himself with the rush-
ing regulations, to be published
soon, as there are a few changes of
a minor nature.

TOMMY DOVE GIVEN
TRAVELING GRANT

Thomas C. Dove, a member of
the present sophomore class, was
recently awarded a grant of $300
to use for a European tour this
summer. He was one of twenty-one
students in the nation to rective

only representative of the Caro-
linas,

The contest in which he won the
grant was the 16th Annual Scholar-
ship Contest sponsored by the Stu-
dents’ International Travel Associa-
