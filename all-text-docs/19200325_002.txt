Who will be the Queen of Love

What’s more, gentlemen, there are
;going to be plenty of “Queens” for
the victorious knight to pick the

‘be enough left for the vanquished
heroes. Saturday, with Queens Col-

DAVIDSON BATTALION
ACCEPTS CHALLENGE

FROM WOFFORD | call it, surely wrought wreckage in:

R. O. T. C. to Hold Gallery Contest
With Methodist Institution.

Davidson is soon to enter an in-
ter-collegiate contest of a nature
which for her at least is a decided
innovation. At the battalion forma-
tion on Tuesday of last week, Major
Hall read a letter from the com-
mandant of the R. O. T. C. unit at
Wofford, challenging the Davidson
cadets to a gallery match. By an al-
most unanimous vote it was decided
to accept this challenge, and the pre-
liminary contests for the selection of
D. C.’s riflemen are to begin at once.

The rules that Wofford proposes
are as follows: (1) Each team shall
consist of 18 men; (2) each man
shall fire two shots from each posi-
tion, rapid and slow fire; (3) the
ranges shall be 50 and 75 yards, the
rifle U. S. twenty-two calibre, model
1903 gallery rifle; (4) the target
shall be the ‘regulation 50 yar
American Rifle Association target.
The members of the teams will fire
independently and the targets and
scores will be mailed to the district
headquarters in Charleston to be
compared. Any time after April
5 wil be acceptable to Wofford.

As a further incentive tp active
endeavor, Captain Mueller announc-
ed that each afternoon’s firing squad
would receive credit for an extra
drill period. He hopes that every
member of thie R. O. T. C. will go
out to “win for the honor of Old
Davidson,” and help put the col-
lege’s name on the distinguished list.

HUNTERSVILLE TEAM
SWAMPED BY COACH
HENGEVELD’S CHARGES

Richards to Ratchford to McArn
was the route of the sensation of the
Huntersville-Davidson me of
Monday afternoon, and that sensa-
tion came in the form of a triple
play. That is unless piling up the
greatest string of errors ever wit-
nessed in these parts is considered a
sensation. The visiting aggregation
certainly did the featuring if the lat-

ter proposition be true. Stage
fright, field fright or whatever you

the camp of the high-schoolers.

The final score, like the number of
errors, is unknown. The official
tabulator ceased operations in the
early stages of the contest with
Coach Hengeveld’s proteges drag-
ging a 20 to O score after them. No-
bly aided by the visitors’ outfielders,
some half-dozen of the collegians
connected for four-sack smacks.

Currie, Miley, Sorrels, Justice and
Streibich occupied the mound in the
foregoing order. Wrenn and Cop
Johnson did the receiving, with Bar-
nette and Dug McArn making the
put-outs at first. Ratchford and the
two Cassells completed the infield.
Richards, Crawford and Shepherd
took care of the flies in the suburban
regions.

Immediately after Richards’ homer

in the first the right fielder of Hunt-|.

ersville could not be induced to roam
any nearer the plate than the outside
tim of the track somewhere in the
vicinity of Concord. The fence
which encloses Sprunt field prevent-
ed a number of circuit clouts by the
more enterprising of the local bat-
ters.

A Better Davidson is Our Goal.

GOLF TOURNAMENT WELL
UNDER WAY-—-GAME
SOON WITH GASTONIA

Davidson Golf club’s annual spring
tournament is well under way. It
is being played every afternoon of
this week, and a great deal of inter-
est is being taken in it by the faculty
members and students. A definite
prize has been set, four in all, giving
the greatest amount of chances for
honors. The entrance fee is one ball,
the winner taking 50 per cent and
the next three being divided accord-
ingly.

Another outcome of this tourna-
ment will be the selection of the
team to play various clubs round
about, the first game with Gastonia
County Club here on April 8. There
will be from four to six men, a good
chance for all. Get interested, fel-
lows, and give it a try. Get infor-
mation at No. 7 Georgia.

lege as visitors, there will be staged
one of the greatest track meets re-
corded in annals of the cinder path.

The highest individuat point get-
ter will pick the queen.

The prospects are exceptionally
good this year. Murray, Brice and
Denniston are showing up well in
the dashes. Sprunt, Covington, Rus-
sell and Dick are rounding into form.
lFor the hurdles, Dick, Davis and Mc-
Caskill are making fast time. In the
field sports Murray is showing up
to good advantage on the broad
jump; Green and McCaskill are step-
ping over the bar at the highest
notch thus far, while Garrett and
Carr are fighting it out between
themselves for the pole vaulting job.

In the weights McLeod and Rob-
erts are trying to beat the present
college record.

The men to make the U. of S. C.
trip and also participate in the Trin-
ity meet which will be held on the
“hill” April 14, will be picked Sat-
urday.

Everybody come out and root for
your class. They will need it, for
never has such a battle been prom-
ised before.

GOLF BECOMING MORE
POPULAR AT eave"

A visitor to the Davidson golf
course would immediately be im-|
pressed with the fact that the Red
and Black Athletic celebrities are
not confined to the student body
alone. Could he but witness the con-
tortions, twists, and swings indulged
in frequently by some of our tradi-
tionally dignified faculty members, |
and, least to say, capped by the cus-
tomary ejaculatory sequence to the
fundamental processes of the game,
he would at once perceive that the
game of golf is no less amusing than
interesting. 1s not the fact that so
many members of the faculty take
an interest in golf sufficient testi-
mony that it is worth while? Should
not more of our students striving to
emulate their happy example give
the game their endorsement and sup-,
port, thereby making it one of the
most lively sports on the hill? The
Golf club is open to all, and needs’
new members. The cost is negligible!
and every bit of money received is:
placed in the advancement of the
club itself. The club sincerely invites
all students to come out on the
course and try the game. Get into
the tournament this week, and if not
a player, back it up with your pres-
ence during the afternoons, and let’s
all make the club a greater asset to
the college. :
