Rodgman exhibits versatility

in baseball, intra-mural sports

Getting Wildcat catcher Mark
Rodgman to talk about himself
is no easy matter. But just ask
any Opposing baserunner who
has ever tried to steal second
base and he will probably be
able to say plenty about him.

The bearded catcher from
Winston-Salem has built up a
respectable reputation in the
Southern Conference as a smart
player with a cannon arm.

Probably no one is as
laudatory of Rodgman as is
Wildcat coach Junior Wade.
“Having played the position
myself I can see that Mark
plays catcher well,’’ com-

Weicker’s .478 leads nation
with superstitious beliefs

By LARRY T. MIMMS

George Weicker has been
swinging his 35“ aluminum bat
like a magic wand. Weicker
who was likened to a fictional
character with cape and large,S
engraved shirt, is leading all
college batters in hitting with a
batting average of .478. He has
blasted 9 home runs, one of
which was instrumental in the
Davidson victory over top-
ranked University of South
Carolina, and has 38 runs batted
in.

Weicker credits his success to
two factors, his concentration
and his bat.

“T began using an aluminum
bat last summer and I hit well
with it. It is a bigger bat than
most people use, 35 inches and
35 oz. I can’t swing as fast, but I
can get more weight behind the
ball.”’

Weicker is very protective of
this bat.

“He won’t let anyone else
touch it, except Alan Alig, who
owns the bat. Alan is the keeper
of the bat,’’ one teammate
stated.

Weicker admitted,‘‘We don’t
keep my bat with the other bats.
I cradled the bat gently on my
arms on the bus ride back from
Univ. of South Carolina.”

Weicker also cited con-
centration as the most im-
portant factor. ‘I have
everything together right now
and it wouldn’t matter what
kind of bat I was using. I’m not
seeing nearly as many good pit-
ches though. The pitchers are
brushing me back, giving me a
lot of outside stuff.’’

‘Last summer I participated
in the Shenandoah Valley
League where many of the top

- college baseball players work
out. I faced some of the best pit-
chers on the east coast, and
with that kind of competition
every night, it forces you to con-
centrate.”’

Weicker suggested that his ex-
perience in the Shenandoah
Valley League, and his attitude
while he played there, con-
tributed immensely to his
current season’s success. He
said that in the summer league
he learned to watch pitchers
and their mannerisms in order
to paick up the type of pitch.

“T can tell when a pitcher
releases the pitch basically
where the pitch will come and
what type of pitch: curve, fast-
ball. I’ve been able to pick up
the ball just as it leaves the pit-

cher’s hand.”’

Weicker claims to be very
superstitious. He goes through
the same routine each time in
the warm up circle.

“T wear the same socks, the
same undershirt, I adjust my
left shoe, and I swing the bat the

same number of times on the ©

warm up circle.”’

Weicker has- established a
ritual at the plate also. In 31
games, he has cranked out 45
hits.

Fans are often amazed at
Weicker’s cool, relaxed com-
posure on the field. One of the
few times that Weicker has ven-
ted his anger was in the South
Carolina game.

Weicker who plays first base

made a perfect stretch on a_

throw from Shortstop Gary

Pomeroy. The umpire called’
the runner safe at first, because -

Weicker, he said, did net:have
his foot on the base.

Weicker recalls the incident.

“This year the umps have -

blown critical calls. Tuesday
night was the worst I’ve seen.
After the call, I went up to the
first base umpire, nose to nose,
said, ‘Look me in the eye, and
tell me my foot was off the base,
ump: Ump, you blew it, and I
hope it doesn’t cost us the
game.’ The ump didn’t say
anything because he couldn’t

have seen my foot.’’

Weicker who has forearms
like Mickey Mantle, can get his
point across.

“There is no question that
George has been a real team
leader with his bat and play,”
‘said another Davidson player.

Weicker, was an all state
shortstop and second baseman
in high school, played outfield
his freshman year at Davidson,

and for the past two years has

held down first base.

“T definitely want to go into
pro baseball if at all possible’’,
Weicker stated. “I know a
couple of pro scouts out of
Baltimore, but they haaven’t
said anything to me about

_ possible contracts

mented Wade.

Rodgman is tough offensively
as well and is considered one of
the top hitters on the team, with
a midseason average of .338.

But behind the plate is where
he is at his best. Commented
one teamate, ‘‘Mark is a
thinking player. He can figure
out a batter’s weakness and
then go to work on it.”
Rodgman calls all of the pitches
for the Cats.

He can do it all, but most im-
portant he has the fun-
damentals down. For example,
he uses his body well in stopping
the wild pitches.

As a result of the mastering of
such techniques no runs have
been scored on the Cats this
year on wild or passed pitches.

Rodgman demonstrated his
versatility by starting at third
baseman for Davidson as a
freshman before taking over
the catcher slot the following
year.

Rodgman’s athletics are not
confined to the baseball
diamond however. As a mem-
ber of the infamous Cleveland
Indians he has helped to
establish them as ever-tough
competitors in IMAC basket-
ball. The Indians are always
found in the higher plateaus of
IMAC sports.

ete:

Rodgman seems to genuinely
enjoy playing baseball for
Davidson. “It’s a good sport
and it’s great to get outdoors in
the spring,”’ he said. fi

Rodgman is most pleased
with the success of the Wildcats'
this season. ‘‘The team’s base!
for the last three years are all
Seniors’ now, plus everyone
likes to. play for Coach Wade.
He really has a rapport with the
individual players,’’ concluded
Rodgman.

Rodgman is quick to mention
his fellow teammates when
discussing the Wildcats winning
season.

“Weicker is carrying the
team offensively and the pit-
ching has been great. Fresh-
man third baseman Dale Hor-
ner has done a lot to tighten up
the infield too,’’ explained
Rodgman.

Upon leaving Davidson,
Rodgman is undecided as to
what his plans are.

“Minor league baseball is a
possibility but I will have to see
what happens,’’ predicted
Rodgman.

If Rodgman’s determination
and performance for the Wild- -
cat Baseball team are any in-
dication of his future,.he should
do fine.
