Card - Carryin
Shuttle Into Elections

This year only card-carrying members of the Student Body will be allowed to
vote. Election LD. ‘ards and other elections changes will be presented to the Student
Body in Monday’s Assembly.

These LD. cards will be avail-
able on Monday at the tables on
Gtst floor of Chambers. After-
wards, they can be secured from
Pdul Duvall, the Chairman of
the Elections Board. A student
must have his card punched be-
fore he receives a ballot. The
ecards are being used in order
that two polling places may be
set up—on the first floor of
Chambers ahd in the Post Of-
fice.

To standardize the Student
Body elections, the Student
Council has expanded By-laws
2 and 3 to include the complete
set of rules and procedures.

Scholars Con

This change will allow the poli-
cies to continue from year to
year rather than have them
subjected to the whims of each
new Elections Board.

The changes are basically
these:

@The student body shall
elect the Student Body Officers,
nominated by the entire student
body: the editors of THE DAV-
IDSONIAN, SCRIPT’S AND
PRANKS, and THE WILDCAT
HANDBOOK, nominated by the

For Competetive Weekend

Yesterday 29 of the Class of ’67 arrived at Davidson
to begin competition for Freshman Scholarships.

Part of the 250 high school
seniors accepted for enrollment
at Davidson as of Wednesday,
feb. 20, the students come from
as far away as Boulder, Colo.
and as close as Statesville. North
Carolina claimed her share of
the scholars with a total of
seven, and Pennsylvania ran a
sclose second with five.

Today the competitors, all of
whom are in the top 7% of their
‘respective classes, attended
telasses with the student body
and began the all important in-
terviews which will determine
tow scholarships are awarded.

Tomorrow's schedule in-

eludes more classes, inter-

views, and a tour of the cam-
pus. This year, unlike prev-
ious years, only one group of

Scholarship Finalists was in-

vited to Davidson instead of

the usual two.

Selection of these and the
other 221 freshmen -has caused
many anxious moments on the
part of the Admissions Com-
mittee and the Office of Admis-
sions. Since late in December
they have been engaged in the
final processing of some 935
applications and 1250 CEEB
scores.

WF Continues Study
Of German Scholar

Dr. S. D. Maloney continues
leading a series of discussions
on Rudolf Bultmann for the
Westminster Fellowship at the
group’s meeting tonight.

Last week the group held a
general discussion of Bultmann’s
heliefs, while tonight they are
evaluating Bultmann's ideas. On

March 22, they will discuss
Baltmann’s successors.
Because of his efforts to

“demythologize” the New Testa-
..ment, Bultmann, a German
_§cholar and theologian, has long
been the object of controversial
discussions. Keith Brenner, vice
president of Westminster Fel-
‘lowship, believes that the dis-
cussions will be very valuable
, and should present “a possibility
.for those who try to square
_ faith with science.”

The Queens WF will meet
with the Davidson group March
29 for supper and a program on
the Roman Catholic Church's
Second Ecumenical Council.
Speaking will be Father Cuth-
bert Allen. Director of Public
Relations at Belmont Abbey
College.

While the number of total
applications is 100 fess than
those received by this date
last year, the two final fig
ures of total applications
should reach proximity as
more are being received each
day.

However, this deficit in ap-
plications has produced no
qualms. The average CEEB
scores are 10 points higher on
the verbal and 6 points higher
on the math than those of this
year’s freshman class.

Director of Admissions, H.
Edmunds White, commented
this week, ‘Today it is as hard,
or harder to get accepted at
Davidson as it was in previous
years.” White further stated’
that the decrease in applica-
tions at this time was almost
totally from the student that
would have been rejected had
he applied.

A list of those freshmen
who have already been accept-
ed for next year has been sent
to all the fraternities and
should be posted in Chambers
in the near future. Further
yecceptances will be mailed
out March 20.

* ¢ *

A film and companion docu-
mentary of Davidson are being
compiled and will be available
to high schools throughout the
country in the near future.

It is hoped that this film will
encourage a greater number of
superior students to apply to
Davidson, as well as. further es-
tablish Davidson's reputation as
an outstanding liberal arts col-
lege.

On Union Next Month

Plans for the new addition to the David Ovens Col-
lege Union are now being finished by the architect and
construction should be started in the near future, possi-
bly as soon as the middle of April.

Completion will depend on
the starting date, weather, and
other undeterminable factors,
but college officials hope that
the addition will be completed
early in the fall of this year.

The plans call for two phases
of construction. The first, which
will be started as soon as possi-
ble, will consist of a 6,500
square foot air-conditioned wing
to be added south of the present
dining room. This wing will pro-
vide a consolidated facility for

Machine Age In The Door

BY RICK von UNWERTH
Davidsonian Feature Writer

The Age of Speed has given the world an exciting way to do business, and some
Davidson students are moving with the times.

In the basement of Chambers
Building, a complex of machines
provides a fascinating challenge
and a very profitable oppor-
tunity for interested Davidson
personnel.

Professor Locke White pro
posed a program of study of
the new IBM computer in a

chapel program last semester,.

and several students undertook
a brief familiarization course
with the machine before the
Christmas holidays.

Five students have been is- |

sued “licenses” to operate the
complex device, and ere help-
ing White as assistants this
semester in aiding others be-
gin their orientation.

White calls his non-credit, ex-

tra-curricular lecture meetings:

a course in Computer Apprecia-
tion. Two groups gather on
Tuesdays during the third and
fourth periods to absorb infor-
mation and techniques in the
rudiments of.computer program-
ming and use.

The lectures are expected to

—— ee,

give students some insight into

the way computers in general
will influence society, as well
as practical knowledge of the
machines themselves.

The first part of the course,
according to White, will be
concemed primerily with the
capabilities and imptementa-
tion of the particular machine
with which the classes will
work, and the latter half wil!
deal with computers in gen-
eral. “We will study « wide
variety of problems for all
types of computers during the
last half of the course,” White
said.

The computer room will be
open Monday through Friday in
the evening between 7 and 9
for students to work with the
machine, and for anyone inter-
ested in observing or studying
it. Licensed assistants will be on
hand during those hours.

The administration will have
priority on scheduling the ma-
chine for chapel periods, but
reservations may be made by
qualified persons during most
other hours of the day.

Although Davidson College
is not currently using the com-
puter for its business com-

putations, several benefits to
the college ere expected to

come from it.

Some enormous computations
were made for the Registrar's
Office during the holidays,
White said. The figures comput-
ed were unnecessary in them-
selves, but information derived
from them proved helpful, and
could conceivably save the ad-
ministration a good deal of
labor.

crease in the laboratory meas-
urements students may make in
seience courses, because “com-
putation is painless now.”

Sinee the machine is designed
for expediency in calculations,
White expects the college to
profit from it in a variety of
ways. “I just may use the com-
puter,” he said, “to calculate my
Thermo course (Heat and Ther-
modynamics) grades.” He inti-
mated that the machine would

White also anticipates an in- be on the students’ side.

mpason that all men of good will are fond of Marlboros—because
Martboro is an honest cigarette. Those good Marlboro tobaccos
are honestly good, honestly aged to the peak of perfection, hon-
estly blended for the best of all possible flavors. Marlboro

dean the marriage seemed ill-advised, for Walter was only 18
years old and Emma was 91. Walter agreed with the dean, but
said he felt obligated to go through with it because Emma had
invested her life savings in a transparent rainhood to protect
her from the mist at Niagara Falls, where they planned to spend
their honeymoon. If Walter called off the wedding, what use
would the poor woman possibly have for a rainhood in Yutah?
The wise, kindly dean pondered briefly and came up with a
brilliant answer: let Walter punch holes in the back of Emmna’s
steam iron. With steam billowing back at the old lady, she
would find a rainhood very useful—poesibly even essential.

Whimpering with gratitude, Walter kissed the dean’s Phi
Beta Kappa key and hastened away to follow his advice—and
the results, I am pleased to report, were madly successful !

Today Emma is a happy woman—singing lustily, wearing
her rainhood, eating soft-center chocolates, and ironing clothes
—twice as happy, to be candid, than if she had married Walter
... And what of Walter? He is happy too. Freed from his un-
wanted liaison with Emma, he married a girl much nearer his
own age—Agnes Yucca, 72. Walter is now the proud father—
stepfather, to be perfectly accurate—of three fine, healthy
boys from Agnes’s first marriage—Everett, 38; Wilhelm, 43;
and Irving, 5—and when Walter puts the boys on a lead and
takes them for a stroll in the park on Sunday afternoon, you
may be sure there is not a dry eye in Yutab.

And Dean Sigafoos? He too is happy—happy to spend long,
tiring hours in his little office, giving counsel without stint and
without complaint, doing his bit to set the young, uncertain
feet of his charges on the path to a brighter tomorrow.
