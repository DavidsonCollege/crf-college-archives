CLASS BASEBALL.

The 1917 class baseball series will be-
gin within the next two weeks. Practice
has been going on steadily during the
past week. With good weather condi-
tions there has heen nothing to hinder
the candidate's getting in shape for the
annual tie-up.

The Seniors, under the leadership of
“Bill” Mattison, should put out a good
team. The four-year men will have the
advantage of better team work.

The Juniors, with George King look-
ing after their interests, will need noth-
ing but a fair degree of luck. The
champions of last spring are. expecting
to repeat the dose.

The Sophs, with “Yank"’ Boswell as
manager, can be counted on to put out a
fighting nine. Already they have shown
their athletic prowess in basketball and
football. The pitching staff is their
only stumblingblock at present.

The Fresh have not elected a manager
yet. However, practice has revealed a
good team in the making. With Garri-
son twirling they should make things
lively for the upper-classmen.

All indications scem to point out that
the series will be of special interest and
one that will cause the students to sit up
and take notice.

C. E. SOCIAL IS PLANNED.

The Christian Endeavor Society is
planning to give a social in Shearer Hall
on Saturday night, April 28th, to which
the whole student body is cordially in-
vited. A mock trial will be presented,
and while the jury is out deliberating on
the case some light refreshments will be
served to the audience.

Several members of the faculty have
given or intend to give commencement

liver the commencement address at the
Statesville Female Institute on the 16th
of May, and at Shopton on the 14th of
the same month. Professor Currie will
speak at Red Springs on the 8th of May.

ments will be made in the near future
with the faculty members.

DR. MARTIN MAKES
TWO ADDRESSES

Dr. W. J. Martin, accompanied by
his wife, has been in Wilmington dur-
ing the week attending the centennial of
the First Presbyterian Church of that
city. Dr. Martin had been invited to
speak during the weck’s exercises of the
church, and on Tuesday addressed the
congregation. His theme was “Com-
plete Surrender to Christ,” and the basis
of his address was the call of Christ,
“Follow me and I will make you fishers
of men.”

On Wednesday morning Dr. Martin
spoke to the Wilmington High School,
his subject being “Patriotism.” In this
talk he clearly set before the members
of the school the duty that the Amer-
ican citizen owes to his country.

The following clipping from a letter
written by Mr. Andrew Allison, of
Kiong-yin, China, addressed to the First
Presbyterian Church, Wilmington,
should be of interest to the student body
and many outside friends, reference be-
ing made to Dr. Geo, C, Worth, father
of W. C. and C. W. Worth, both of
‘19, who for twenty-two years has been
a missionary in China: “Dr. Worth
doesn’t know anything about it, but as
his fiftieth birthday approaches, the dis-
trict magistrate and the gentry of the
country are preparing a tremendous ova-
tion, to be carried out with true orental
splendor and display, and we hear that
the Board of Trade of Wusih, the big
city thirty miles away, where the Worths
settled first, are also invited to partici-
pate. And not to be behindhand, the
hospital staff have assessed themselves
at what looks to us a prodigious figure,
considering their incomes, and are going
to follow up the big affair with one all
their own, having the school, etc., to
help. There will be at least two days
of celebration, and our modest Doctor
will be overwhelmed when he learns of
it.”
