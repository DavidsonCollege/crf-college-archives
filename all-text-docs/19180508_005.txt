where he is having a big time. Pat
writes as follows:

“This is a wonderful country and |
am glad I am here. Men are in fine
spirits. Will have lots of funny things
to tell you when I get back to the U. S.

A. Best wishés to old D. C.”

In another part of the card we have
an evidence that ‘Pat’? has not gone
back on his training, and he will prob-
ably be quite famous with the ladies in
Wareham—Pat has been promoted to
the rank of Sergeant.

Below is given a copy of the card
which the Mayor of Wharem has gotten
out:

“Americans and comrades—in arms
for Liberty:

“We give you a hearty welcome to
this, one of the most ancient towns of
the realm, on your way to win a victory
for civilization. ‘

“You who share with us the glories of
Shakespeare and Milton, whose love of
liberty and righteousness has been nur-
tured by the same Bible in the same
tongue, do not come amongst us as
strangers, but as brothers.”

And so on.
Alas, for the horrors of war.

S. A. Robinson, 'oo, has recently been
elected to the position of trusteeship of

. MARKER FOR GRAVE OF,
GEN. DAVIDSON ASSURED

Dr. Charles-L. Summers, of Winston-
Salem, Professor of Clinical Pediatrics
and visiting pediatrician of the Univer-
sity Hospital by the faculty of Physics
of the University of Maryland School
of Medicine and has entered upon his
duties.

The North Carolina Historical So-
ciety offered to donate $100 for the
purpose of placing a marker at the grave
of the Revolutionary hero, who was
buried at Hopewell Church, and for
whom Davidson: College wis named,
Gen. William Lee Davidson.

The condition made was that $100
would be raised in the community, and
this condition has been generously met
by Mr. E. L. B. Davidson, of Charlotte,
who is not a relative of General David-
son, but is much interested int having his
grave properly marked.

The Mecklenburg Declaration of In
dependence Chapter of the Daughters
of the American Revolution has kindly
agreed to take charge of the matter, and
will if possible secure at least $200 more
in order that a worthy stone may be
placed on his grave. ‘The time limit
named by the Historical Society in which
the work must be completed is Novem:
ber 1, 1918.

Mr. J. D. Sargent, of Mt. Airy, has
offered a granite slab for the purpose, in
case that material is selected by the com
mittee having the matter in charge.

Rev. W. M. Baker, ‘10, who for a
number of years has been in Wilming-
ton, engaged in colored mission work,
has accepted a call and entered upon his
work as pastor of the Presbyterian

Church at Mount Olive.

Rev. J. C. Purcell, ’05, has accepted a
call to the First Presbyterian Church of

Chester, S. C.

Davidson is proud to be the alma
mater of nearly three hundred ministers
of the Gospel, three of these being in
other denominations than the Presby-
terian. This group is further classified
as having twenty-six on the foreign field
and twenty-nine in home mission work.
She is also proud of having trained thirty
colleges, university or theological semi-
nary presidents and eighty-three profes-
sors in similar institutions.

Consider the program that appears in
others columns of this paper and pre-
pare to arrive in time for the opening
exercises and expect to leave your busi-
ness long enough to stay to the end. The
date is May 26 to 29, three days of gen-
uine college life. As usual the alumni
are expected to play a large part in the
festivities, and the annual meeting of
the Alumni Association will be held.
Officers will be elected at this meeting
and other matters of business transact-
ed, and, as usual, a banquet will be held.

This is the year for the reunion of
classes 1893, 1898, 1903, 1908 and
1913. All members of these classes are
especially urged to make every effort
possible to be present. All members of
other classes are cordially invited.
Alumni will be interested to inspect the
new pymnasium that has been. erected

student and as a distinguished - visitor.
This was some while ago, May 20, 1916,
in fact. As he found an enthusiastic
student body then, so is it now. It is
estimated that at least fifty men who
would be in college, were it not for the
war, are now patriotically serving their
country, to say nothing of the new men
who did not enter in the fall because of
the war. The present Senior class will
give twenty-six more just after com-
mencement and altogether there are well
over four hundred known to be in serv-
ice from the ranks of Davidson alumni.

When some careful reader discovered
that the editor of the Hollins Magazine,
published by a girl’s school in Virginia,
was edited by “Leslie Patterson,” they
began to suspect that “Pat,” ex-'18, of
commissary and 118 page letter fame,
had not really gone to the war to make
the world safe for democracy. But all
these base insinuations have now been
laid in forgotten dust by the receipt of a
card from Pat himself. He is now in
the famous town of Wareham, England,

WILSON’S DAYS AT DAV&RSON.

William Bayard Hale in his book,
“Woodrow Wilson—the Story of His
Life,” gives some interesting informa-
tion about Davidson in 1873, the date
of Wilson’s entrance. ‘The following is
a brief summary.

Hale refers to Davidson at this time
as a “‘staunch school, an excellent col-
lege of stout Presbyterian proclivities.”
“Vhe central building,” he says, “stood
in the midst of an unkempt fig d was
a building of considerable nobility, with
a rotunda and dome and two side
wings.” He refers to the fact that the
“long corridor ran thru the length of
the building—much to the detriment of
discipline.”

“Primitive” living was the term used
to describe the daily life of the students,
the students looking after their own
rooms entirely. Reference is made to
the record held by ‘fom Wilson, namely,
chat of dressing and reaching chapel in
the minimum time. Davidson then was a
small village. ‘Fhe names of Squire Al-
tison and John Scofield were mentioned
as the keepers of two grocery stores.

“Instruction at Davidson was rather
better than was cummon at small col-
jeges in those days,” says the author.
“Still it can hardly be said that Wilson
received much intellectual impulse here,
altho he probably added something to his
stock of knowledge.” Ex-Gov. R. B.
Glenn was one of Wilson's classmates,
as was also ‘Vhornton Whaling of Co-
lumbia Seminary.

Wilson was described by his class-
mates as an open-faced student with
pleasing manners and was very generally
liked. He was never much in the ath-
letic of his day which consisted of base-
ball and “shinny.” He did aot make
the college nine, altho he impressed the
captain as being rather lazy. He was a
great walker and a great talker in con-
genial company. While at Davidson he
was a member of the Eumencan Literary
Society and received a vote of thanks
from that body for copying their consti-
tution for them. Wilson planted his
tree on the campus and this remains to-
day and is pointed out as Woodrow
Wilson’s tree.

Becoming sick just before examina-
tions it was necessary for him to with-
draw from college and he went to Wil-
mington, where his father had accepted
the pastorate of the First Presbyterian
Church: A year of recuperation fitted
him for Princeton, wliere he finished his
education, entering that institution in
1876. Woodrow Wilson attended Da-
vidson with the class of ’77, being here
during the year 1873-74. °

LETTER FROM CAMP GREENE.

Hearquarters Comp Greene,
Charlotte, N. C., April 27, 1918:
Miss Cornelia Shaw, Librarian,

Davidson College, Davidson, N. C.
My dear Miss Shaw:

The commanding general directs me
to acknowledge receipt of a gift of two
boxes of books received through you,
from Davidson. The books have been
turned over to the American Library
Association representatives at this camp,
and are available for use by this entire
command.

The commanding general wishes me
to express to you his personal thanks,
and the thanks of the many troops at
this station, for your thoughtfulness and
generosity in making this gift.

While a soldier’s life in these stren-
uous times, ts necessarily filled with hard
physical labor, we all appreciate the
great value of a diversion in the form of
good clean reading.

Hoping you will express the com-
manding general’s thanks and appreci-

ation to all the donors of Davidson, I am

Yours sincerely,
(Phelps Newberry),
Major, Signal Corps, Camp Adjt.
