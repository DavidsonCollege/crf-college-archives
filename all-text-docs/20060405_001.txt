Sophomores, juniors to live
in Martin Court next year

By EmiLy Kota
Senior Staff Writer

Of the 342 students living in
Martin Court, the “senior apart-
ments,” next year, 24 are rising
sophomores and 18 are rising jun-
iors.

“This has been a wacky year,”
said Leslie Marsicano, Associate
Dean of Students and Director of
Residence Life. “Every year, some
underclassmen apply to live in
Martin Court, but this year, the
long shots really paid off.”

Last year, there were no all-jun-
ior apartments in Martin Court,
although in previous years it has
been routine for several apartments
to house a combination of juniors
and seniors and several apartments
to house all juniors.

While some _ underclassmen
withdrew their applications for
Martin Court housing when they
realized the difference in cost, it
did not deter most interested under-
classmen.

According to RLO’s Lottery
Handbook online, the rate for a
Martin Court apartment is $5,675 a
year, while a double is $4,536 a
year.

Sophomores and juniors will be living in the senior apartments.

RLO took steps to give seniors
priority to Martin Court.

“I am under the impression that
all seniors who wanted apartments
and submitted applications got
them,” Marsicano said.

Elizabeth Books ’06, a Martin
Court building manger this year,
has some concerns about under-
classmen living in senior apart-
ments.

“T think it removes from the cul-
ture that is supposed to be in senior

apartments,” Books said. “As a
building manager, I expect that
most people living in senior apart-
ments are 21. Underclassmen liv-
ing there will make alcohol issues
harder to control.”

Some rising seniors are also con-
cerned.

“I’m irate,” Natalie Dennis ’07
said. “I think it’s a rite of passage
that sophomores should live in

The Office of Admission and

_ Financial Aid sent 955 Regular

Decision acceptance letters to
applicants last Friday, offering
them spots in the class of 2010.

This year’s acceptance rate is 29
percent, up from 25.8 percent last
year.

By May I, the acceptance dead-
line, admissions officers said they
hope to assemble a class of 460
freshmen. Already, 181 students
have been accepted to the class of
2010 via Early Decision Plans |
and H.

This year’s freshman class will
be the first to which a new student
loan cap will apply.

While students could accrue up
to $19,000 in student debt in the
past, the new policy allows stu-
dents to take out only $3,000 worth
of loans each year for a maximum
of $12,000 worth of student loan
debt upon graduation.

The new policy will apply to all
current students beginning next
year and will increase the amount

of grant money they receive by the
same amount that it decreases their
loans.

Although last year’s freshman
class exceeded the target number
of 460, the admissions office said it
is being cautious not to oversub-
scribe the class of 2010 because the
demand for on-campus housing is
increasing, and Duke dormitory
will be closed for renovations dur-
ing the 2006-2007 academic year.

Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid Chris Gruber said
that, while building a freshman
class, the Admissions staff must
consider a wide variety of factors,
the first of which is a candidate’s
potential to achieve success while
at Davidson.

“I want to admit a student,” he
said, “but, more importantly, I want
to graduate a student.”

After considering potential for
success, academic achievement,
talents and character, Admissions
looks to accept students from a
variety of ethnic, socioeconomic
and cultural backgrounds.

Keeley named VP
for College Relations

By SARAH BALEY
Staff Writer

Former Director of Development
Eileen Keeley ’89 was appointed
Davidson’s new Vice President for
College Relations on Mar. 13.

Keeley’s responsibilities as Vice
President for College Relations
include overseeing College
fundraising, College communica-
tions, the Office of Alumni
Relations, the College radio station
and donor relations and events.

“The mission broadly is to facil-
itate relationships with outside
constituencies - mainly alumni,
parents and friends of the College -
and do what we can to strengthen
the bonds that exist. between those
groups and [Davidson],” Keeley
said.

Several considerations encour-

aged Keeley to apply for the posi-
tion of Vice President.

“Partly, I was ready for another
challenge,” Keeley said, “but a lot
of it has to do with my affection for
Davidson.”

Keeley believes that her former
job in Alumni Relations will be
helpful as she takes on her new
responsibilities.

“One of the ways I think it will
help me is that, certainly on the
fundraising side, I know people’s
strengths and how talented they
are,” Keeley said. “I also have 16
years of relationships built with
alumni, parents and friends of the
College.”

Despite her familiarity with the
fundraising staff and outside con-
stituencies, Keeley acknowledges
