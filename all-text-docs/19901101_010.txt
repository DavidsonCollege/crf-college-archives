Standout in Red-
White Scrimmage

By BRUCE BALESTIER

Freshman guard Jason Zim-
merman’s gamewinning basket
gave the White team a 60-58
triumph over the Red team in the
annual intra-squad scrimmage
Saturday night, the viewing pub-

lic*sinitiaHookatthis year’s much—

improved. Davidson basketball
team.

Junior college transfer Jeff
Chapin extended a warm welcome
to the Parents’ Weekend crowd in
his first appearance as a Wildcat.

, The 6’9" forward buried one
baseline jump shot after another
for the White team, en route to 16
points on 8-10 shooting from the
field.

Sophomore forward J.D. Heuer
continued his bid for a spot in the
Starting. lineup,- contributing 15
points and 7 rebounds in. an

inmpressive performance. for. thes

White squad.

On the Red side, junior rebar
Paul Denmond announced to all in
attendance that his steady shot is
back to normal; his 14 point effort
included 3-4 accuracy from three-
point range. Freshman Ron Hor-

ton demonstrated his versatility at
the small forward slot. He handed
out 5 assists to go along with his 8
points, one of the assists a beauti-

‘ful pass to center Detlef Musch,

who cashed it in with athunderous
dunk.

Coach Bob McKillop made
clear-that-afreshman-may-possess
the starting point guard slot on this
year’s team, bestowing time at the
point mainly upon freshmen Pat
Holloway and Jason Zimmerman
for their respective Red and White
teams.

The two freshmen showed both
their inexperience and their boun-
tiful talent; Holloway finished 8
points and three assists, while
Zimmerman overcame arocky start
to dish out five assists and score
five points, including the winning
hoop as time expired.

The.best news of the evening
was that the two teams combined
shot over 50% from the floor, a
trick that last year’s Wildcats never
could learn.

Continued success in this area
should translate into marked im-
provement for the 1990-1991
Wildcats.

Men's Tennis

Men's Tennis Defeats UNC-C

By ROBERT GRUBB

The men’s tennis team put on
an impressive performance for par-
ents’ weekend, winning what
Coach Jeff Frank called the Wild-
cats most important match of the
fall season.

UNC-C had beaten Davidson
lastspring and came into the match
with few changes in their lineup.
“Weknew how tough UNC-C was,
so this victory is a good indication
that we are a stronger team,” said
Frank.

Led by Kurtis Zabell and John
Beyer in the number one slot, the
Cats responded to Frank’s con-
cerns about their doubles play
earlier this season, winning four of
the five doubles matches.

Frank called the team’s per-
formance its best of the season.
Zabell and Beyer defeated UNC-
C’snumberone player, Stan Cocke,
and his partner, John Meyer, 6-3,
6-1.

Davidson suffered its only loss

atthe number 2 position with Albie
Varoski and Dale Voeks falling to
David Maxwell and Stephen Mur-
dock after winning the first set.

“T think Maxwell and Mur-
dock were their best doubles team,
partially because they’ve played
together for three years,” said
Frank.

Frank also praiséd the play of
freshmen Russell Briggs and Ryan
Harper. Briggs and Harper won
their match at third doubles in three
sets.

They lost the second set 6-2,
after dominating the first set 6-1.
“They [Harper and Briggs] suf-
fered a letdown in the second set,”
said Frank. “I told them to close
down the netand play aggressively,
as they had in the first set.”

The singles play was not as
strong as the doubles. The Wild-
cats emerged from the singles
portion of the match with a 6-4
lead, with four of the victories
coming from the bottom four posi-
tions of the lineup.

The four losses in the top six
positions, which are normally.
scored in a match, concerned Za-
bell.

“If you only count the top six
singles and first three doubles, we
would have lost the match,” said

Zabell.““We’re happy with the win,
but we need to look forward to the
spring (where only nine matches
will be played).”

Frank echoed this concern,
noting that the rest of the fall sea-
son will consist mainly of playing
round-robin matches to determine
the final lineup. “I want to make
sure I have people playing where
they should be,” said Frank.

Overall Frank was pleased with
the match, and especially with the
play of Zabell. “Kurtis is playing
the best tennis I’ ve seen him play,”
said Frank. “He has a confidence
and poise on the court that make
him seem totally in control.”

The team has one remaining
match this fall, 2:00 p.m. Nov. 8 at
Queens College.
