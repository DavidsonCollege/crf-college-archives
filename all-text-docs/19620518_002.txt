THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

FRIDAY, MAY 18, 1962

‘To Educate All Youth .. .’

Neither the Charter of Davidson College nor the By-Laws of the Trustees
have ever stipulated that race, nationality, creed or class should be a condition
for admission to the student body of the institution. Indeed the first charter of
the Trustees of Davidson College expressed the earnest desire “to educate youth
of all classes without any regard to the distinction of religious denominations,
and thereby promote the more general diffusion of knowledge and virtue.” The
present Trustees of the College would reaffirm the spirit of that first charter, and
in so doing would advise the Faculty te consider carefully all applications received
from prospective students, and to approve for admission those whom they con-
sider properly qualified upon the basis of such general considerations as charac-
ter, intellectual and general ability, scholastic interest, loyalty to the: ideals of
the college, and promise of future usefulness.

“The vote was not close at. all.
The meeting concluded in fine spirits.
Tm very happy about the whole
thing.” These were the hurried words
from President of the Board Richards.
The twinkle in his eye at 4:30 p.m.
yesterday contrasted heavily with his
tenuous pessimism four hours-earlier.

To be the end of a long-waged,
intense battle on the part of THE
DAVIDSONIAN, the Trustee’s decis-
ion to abolish segregation by race
came simply and undramatically. Pres-
ent juniors and seniors remember the
Integration Special of spring 1960
and Henry Shue’s petition.

We express our hearty thanks to
the Trustees for what we consider
their wise and Christian decision. The
new policy of the college is a re-affir-
mation of the ideal and the spirit of
the college’s original Charter of. 1837.
it answers adequately the resolution
of the 1954 Southern Presbyterian
General Assembly. It reflects the an-
cienf liberalism of a forgotten past,
that of the oldest Old South. the South
that prior to 1840 sponsored the ‘first
abolitionist societies in the country.
And it echoes the spirit of Thomas Jef-
ferson’s early diatribes against the
mounting slave trade.

We express our gratitude to the

(A Statement of Policy, The Trustees
of Davidson College, May 17, 1962)

faculty for providing the recommen-
dation from which the Trustee’s action
evolved. And we thank students and
alumni who took time out from per-
sonally. more lucrative enterprises to
demand that the issue not be ignored.

And we thank those who opposed
the policy revision for the honest
spirit in which they spoke and acted.
(President Richards said there was a
great deal of “eloquence” and “ora-
tory.” “Every conceivable viewpoint
was expressed at length.”)

If there is anything to be said now
about the future, it could be couched
in the words of Dr. Frank W. Price
who said earlier this spring, “I look
forward to the day when Davidson will
offer scholarships to the most prom-
ising graduates of Negro high schools
-in this country and in Africa.

With Dr. Price, we see in the fu-
ture a Davidson whose alumni will in-
clude men serving the needs of the
whole South and the nation in many
different professional capacities. And
we see a Davidson whose student body
will include the challenging diversity
of many different cultural and eco-
nomic backgrounds, Indeed, we look
to a future when Davidson will be one
of the best colleges in the country for
1,000 men

A Worthy Suggestion

The pages of this paper haye been
used many times to underline poor
student attendance at lectures and
presentations in the fine arts. In faet
the almost complete lack of interest
here would tend to support the oft-
bandied prejudice that the. South is
just beginning to discover (or redis-
cover) culture.
™ For this reason we welcome the
recent suggestion made by Dr. Mac-
Cormac in the realm of required ves-
pers and chapel.

Under his plan certain on-campus
presentations, such as lectures or
musical programs, could be attended
in substitution for required ones. A
pledged statement or attendance card

could then be turned in to attest to-

this fact.

We would take the idea one step
fiirther and ask that, as in former
years. attendance at off-campus ves-
pers also be counted in the required
number.

The advantages to such a plan are
fairly obvious. On the one hand _it
would. allow the student more selec-
tivity in those programs which he feels
would widen his orizons most and pro-
vide the best entertainment. Certainly,
with two out of three chapels being of
a secular nature. anyway. some of the

EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

programs in Hodson Hall surpassed
the Chambers programs .in intellec-
tual content and just plain enjoyment.

The wider range of selections
would in turn raise the quality of the
required programs and would give
added support to such things as the
Artist Series which are missed because
of a “lack of time.” The prospect of a
sparse audience will, we hope, spur
planners to seek more of the better

speakers and vary the now-required °

assemblies to a greater degree.

The only possible objection we
can see to such a plan, except.the add-
ed bureaucratic paper work, would be
that'some students would “fudge.” We
think that this could be put in proper
perspective if it is realized that this
is just another word for “cheating.”
The administration has too often un-
consciously encouraged this misunder-
standing by not accepting pledged
Statements concerning behavior or at-
tendance when records show differ-
ently. The honor system should be
recognized as all-encompassing or not
at all.

We hope such extraneous and un-
related considerations will not cloud
the issue. We believe that this plan
deserves some real deliberation based
on its own merits.

Dr. Richards saic that the

with a feeling of joy and grati-

matter of personal likes and dis-:

likes (though this will determine
what a person chooses to en-

discovering what the artist is

Assistant Chaplain Calls For
A More Diverse Davidson

BY VAL FRAKES
Interim Assistant to the
Chaplain

One could say many flattering
things about Davidson and its
students, It attracts bright and
‘gifted applicants. Its projected
humanities course is a bold at-
tempt to restore unity to the
modern and fragmented mind.
While it is not comparable to
Dartmouth and Amherst, it has
the ambition to be so. What fol-
lows is not eulogy, however, be-
eause THE DAVIDSONIAN
asked me to record critical im-
pressions.

Homogeneity is one of David-
son’s greatest liabilities. As Jeff
Wampler noted in last. week's
DAVIDSONIAN, the vast ma-
jority of students here are
Southern, Anglo-Saxon white,
Protestant, and middle to upper
class—the latter meaning that
they are most likely economical-
ly and politically conservative
and unacquainted with the arts,
if not Philistine. Robert Rankin
of the Danforth Foundation
Foundation joked that “David-
son students even look alike”
when he visited the campus for
the first time last fall.

Homogeneity decreases the
rough and tumble of an aca.
demic community. For it is
the sometimes startling en-
counter with men of differ-
ent backgrounds that jars one
to examine his own values,
assumptions, and loyalties—to
ask the questions which make
history, philosophy, and litera-
ture of great concern. One is
never so apt to ask why he is
a Christian, and indeed wheth-
er he wishes to remain one,
as he is when he confronts the
hard-headed agnostic or the
soft-hearted humanist.

At Davidson more. than the
secular university the encounter
with different ideas must occur
through the medium of books.
While the value of books is not
to be discounted, neither is the
meeting of students from différ-
ent milieus in the dormitory as
well as the classroom.

Few bull sessions among
students seem to range be-
yond the exchange of sexual
fantasies. But then, how can
two sons of the bourgeoisie
discuss a concert? And why
should they, engage in lengthy
conversation about economics
or politics? Having assured
one another: that capitalism
made America great and hav-
ing lamented together that
welfare programs are killing
individual initiative, they have
little more to say fo each
other.

Suggestions? Integration be-
comes all the more attractive.
Although Negroes have inhabit-.
ed the same communities with
whites, their cultural exper-
iences have been extremely dif-

Letters
To The
Editor

Goodman

Dear Editor: *

As I look through this year’s
edition of Quips and Cranks, I
definitely feel that Rob Aber.
nethy and his staff deserve com-
mendation for publishing one of
the better annuals that has been
produced at Davidson for the
past several years.

However, this year’s Quips
and Cranks, as last year's, omit-
ted from its activities section
one of the more active campus
organizations, the Wildcat Pep
Band. It seems that the band’s
efforts toward promoting
“school spirit” at all home foot-
ball games and at the road
games at Furman and Richmond
last season merit some sort of
recognition in the yearbook.

I hope that next year’s Quips
and Cranks staff will not over-
look certain “young” campus
groups, such as the Band, which
are at least as active as some of
the “original” organizations.

Dear Editor:

In behalf of the international
students I want to express our
deep appreciation to the:

Richardson Foundation,

Faculty,

Fraternities,

Student Body,

THE DAVIDSONIAN, and

for offering us the opportunity
of studying at Davdson College
and for making our stay here

ferent. Negroes would bring
much-needed diverse perspec.
tives to the campus. Davidson
would do well to spend great
effort in attracting. more stud-
ents from the North and West.
At present Davidson is all but
unknown west of the Mississippi.

Even the faculty does not rep-
resent the diversity that it
might. So many from Davidson's
past broods have returned to the
roost after only short periods of
scratching elsewhere. The facul-
ty has no Jew, no Roman Catho.-
lic, no atheist, no Buddhist, and
as far as I know, no permanent
member who is foreign-born.
Would not the presence of a

few non-evangelical Christians—
there are many such creatures
who are gifted and conscien:
tious scholars—increase the in-
tellectual ferment of the cam-
pus?

Because | had two articulate
and informed Roman Catholic
laymen as professors in my
sophomore year, | was led to
wrestle seriously with the
claims of the Roman church
—even to consider instruction
for membership. Such an oc-
casion for examining church
loyalty seldom presents it-
self to a student at Davidson.

(A digressive word about the
ehurch-related college: For
years at Davidson discussion a-
bout the proper nature of a
church-related college has con-
cluded that the Jatter should
have an all evangelical-Christian
faculty. Hence the faculty oath.
This conclusion promotes homo-
geneity and robs the campus of
the scholastic ability and broad-
ening influence that a ‘non-
evangelical - Christian might
bring. ,

It seems to me that a. church-
related school may properly in-
sist that the Gospel be proclaim.
ed and taught with vitality and
scholarship within its walls.
However, the college, like the
state and the church, most

‘Serves and glorifies God by ful-

filling the peculiar function
which God assigned it as an in-
stitution in Creation. Neither
the state, nor the church, nor
the college really glorifies God
by assuming the peculiar func.
tions of other institutions.

The college’s peculiar task is
to be a seat of learning and a

market-place of ideas. If a. few
non-Christians can make a col-
lege a better market-place of
ideas, then they ought to be
hired—in order that the college
may glorify God to the fullest
extent. Presumably, a church-
related school seeks to do the
latter.)

Many Davidson students,
where, never seem excited by
knowledge, or indeed by any-
along with students else-
thing. Some of the “un-excit-
ed” study more frequently
than they admit, but they do
so—not that they may com-
mit themselves to, or do some-
thing about, whatever truth
they discover—but that they
may become passively know-
ledgeable, or that they may
receive a parchment, or that
they may gain admittance to
graduate school.

Several seniors with whom 1
have talked blame the fraterni-
ties for cajoling students into
the “cool” (I don’t get exicted
about truth, drama, music, God
or anything else.) approach. Bet-
ter to allow enthusiasm to carry
one on even to folly and mistake
than always to stand detached,
looking sophisticated! The cool
attitude robs the individual of
growth and stullifies the air for
others.

There are many students
running loose at Davidson
who seem not to have examin-
ed the politicai and social con-
victions they have brought
from home: labor unions are
evil and “socialistic,” Negroes
are inferior, the great battle
of the twentieth century is to
save the status from those
men in Washington, ete. The
problem is not that students
remain conservative, but that
convictions are often un-ex-
amined, the use of terms—
such as socialism—fuzzy, the
approach emotional rather
than analytical.

Since part of the information
for making intelligent decisions
about the gamut’ of socio-politi-
cal questions derives from the
social sciences, many students
may never submit their convic-
tions to critical evaluation. Dav-
idson offers few courses in the

social sciences—one in anthro-.

pology—and requires none of
what it does offer.

Exchange Student Defends
Belgian Activities In Congo

BY JEAN-PAUL DEFAUW
Richardson Scholar

In 1959, as the result of a billion dollar ten-year plan,
the Congo possessed the most advanced economic infra-
Structure of black Africa. Almost half of the ten-year plan
budget had been earmarked for the development and
modernization of the transportation system. Besides, the
ten-year plan gave new impetus to the exploration of
sources of energy and to agricultural development.

It expanded public utilities,
social progress and scientific re-
search. In the latter field, the
work of the “Institut de Re-
cherche Scientifique en Afrique
Centrale,” generally known as
IRSAC, an institute establish-
ed. in 1947 to coordinate, pro-
mote and prosecute scientific
work, both physical and social,
has been highly praised by
George Kimble in his book,
“Tropical Africa.”

These achievements in the
field of mining, manufactur-
ing, powen sources, agricul-
ture, commerce, economic in-
frastructure, public and social
welfare ond scientific re.
search, demanded money.
From 1949 to 1958, invest-
ments in the Congo amounted
to 2.81 billions of dollars of
which 1.4 billions were pub-
lic and 1.66 were private in-
vestment. More money is
needed to continue the work.
In order to obtein a 5%
growth per year of the Con-
golese economy during the
next five years, an average
annual investment of 400 mil-
lion dollars is needed, rough-
ty half of which is to be sup-
plied by re-investments.

But the economic develop-
ment of a country needs more
than just money. Capital needs
labor, and the development of a
country needs people. Our eco-
nomic achievements in the Con-
go are the products of men.
George Kimble states that from
the time the Belgian Govern-
ment took over the responsibili-.
ty for the Congo, it was fortun-
ate in the caliber of the men
guiding its development. ... ”

Such men are still needed
in the Congo, as are the an-
nual 400-million-dollar invest-
ments, not to organize, under
the label of technical assist-

ance, economic domination,
but to do the job as long as
the Congolese cannot do it
themselves,

In that respect, I want to
stress that the internationaliza-
tion of the development of the
Congo was already the desire
of the Belgian Government long
before independence. During the
Economic Round Table Confer-
ence in Brussels, in April, 1960,
the Belgian Minister of Econom-
ic Affairs of the Congo warned
the Congolese that in appealing
to foreign economists for the
setting-up of a Planning Bureau,
the Congolese Government
should. not limit its appeal to
Belgian economists, but should
seek economists of other nation-
alities in order to make certain .
that the proposed policy ‘would
not be inspired by Belgian in-
terests.

Men are needed and capital
is needed and both demand
guarantees based on interna.
tional law. Once peace is re-
stored in the Congo, those
elements: men, capital and
guarantees will not fail, and
ovr work will be taken up
again by Congolese and for-
eigners alike.

It is my deep conviction that
the countries’ which, as a.result
of the wealth of their soil, their
geographic situation or more
advanced technology, have
reached a higher degree of de-
velopment, have a real duty to
the less developed countries. In
the world of today, more than
ever before in the history of
humanity, all countries ‘and all
races are inter-dependent and-
the progress of one of them
should not mean a decline else-
where, but, on the contrary.
should benefit the others. Over
and above political differences,
a spirit of solidarity should
guide our action.
