THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 6, 1930

Freshman Victorious In
First Big Five Contest
By Overwhelming Score

Wake Forest’s Little Deacons Fall

Before Powerful Attack of

; Brilliant Wildkitten Five
Last Monday night the Davidson Fresh-
men smothered the Wake’ Forest Fresh-
men by the overwhelming score of 32-14.
The game was very rough throughout;
two guards of the Wildkittens, Peabody
and Wagner, were ejected from the game
on personal fouls, and one of Wake Fore
est’s men was taken out for the same
reason. The Wildkittens clearly outplayed
the “Deacon Freshmen. The score at the
, end of the first half was twenty-two to
five in fayor of the Wildkittens. During
the first half the Deacons only obtained

one field goal and three foul goals.

The wholé Wildkitten team played a
brilliant game and the Deacons did not
have mitch chance to score against them.
The guarding gf the Wildkittens was
beautiful to behold, but they were rather
rough at times. The two outstanding
stars for the Kittens were Captain “Skin-
ny” Pierce and Allen Rogers who scored
twelve and eleven points, respectively.
Both were towers of strength on the of-
fense and defense.

The stars for Wake Forest were Green
and Earp who shot six points apiece. Both
were menaces to the Wildkitten cause.
As a whole the Deacons played a brilliant
game against such a strong foe. The Kit-
tens by this victory won their sixth straight
game and their first conquest over a “Big
Five” foe. They went into Virginia with
high hopes as a result of their recent suc-
cesses. :

Whittle Expects To
Make Track Record

Track Captain Shows Form in
Hurdles

Heath Whittle, of Atlanta, Ga., captain
of the Davidson College track team and
hurdler de luxe, will probably break a
North Carolina record in the low hurdles
when the competitors gather in Greens-
boro next May, according to Capt. Norton
G. Pritchett, who has been drilling the
fleet-footed Davidson captain, This state-
ment was made with the reservation that
provided no’ unlooked-for injury occurs
to Whittle.

This Georgia youth is already holder of
the college records at Davidson in both
the high and low hurdles events; break-
ing them during the 1929 season. He
smashed one record that had been stand-
ing since 1901, and in all likelihood he will
lower his own marks in both of these
running events. He has been drilling at
Davidson since his return last September,
and could be seen on the track when
others were absent. Capt. Pritchett, how-
ever, will not let him overtrain, being
thoroughly familiar with the coaching
game.

Comptometers Beat

Lenoir-Rhyne Co-Eds

The Charlotte’ Comptometers staged a
comeback in the second half to defeat the
Lenoir-Rhyne Co-Eds 31 to 23 here last
Saturday night. At the end of the first
period, Lenoir-Rhyne had the advantage
of a close 14-13 score, but the Charlotte
sextet was not to be daunted, and, in the
second half, ran up a total of 16 points
while their opponents made only 9,

Lineberger cinched the game for the
Comptometers by shooting the large total
of 22 points. Long’s flashy floor game and
a total of 6 points were also largely re-
sponsible in determining the victory for
the Charlotte girls.

Rudisill and Whitner were the Lenoir-
Rhyne stars. The former garnered 12
points, and the fast game played by the
latter was a -feature. The game was
played in the Davidson gymnasium.

Wildkittens Defeat
Greensboro Quintet

Last Friday night the Wildkittens of
Davidson defeated the Greensboro High
School by the score of 25-21. This game
was probably the best game that the
| Freshmen have played this year. The fea-
ture of the game was the fast playing

jand the passing attack of both teams.
|

The whole Freshman team played a fine
game and clearly, outplayed the Greens-
boro Highs. Near the close of the game
the Greensboro team put on a rally that
came within four points of tying the
score, This rally started when the score
was Davidson Fresh 25, Greensboro High
15. The boys from Greensboro then
scored six points while they held the
Wildkittens scoreless. At this juncture,
however, the pistol sounded and thus the
game ended with the Wildkittens on the
long end of the score.

The Freshman team worked together
better than they have at any time this
season, No individual star could be picked
from the Wildkittens but the high scorer
for them and for the night was Captain
“Skinny” Pierce, who had twelve points
to his credit. Norman, of Greensboro, was
close ‘behind with a total of ten points.
The Wildkittens’ guarding was up to their
usual ‘standard, They showed the fans that
they should go» well on the trip to Vir-
ginia, where they play three games.

Greensboro offered probably the vest
opponent that the Freshmen ‘have had
this season. In their rally they proved
that they had a brilliant team and would
give any High School or Freshman team
a good battle. Norman, their forward and
high scorer, was the star for the Gate
City men.

Duke Game Changed
To Charlotte Court

Because of the inadequacy of the Alum-
ni Gymnasium at Davidson to accommo-
date large basketball crowds, athletic of-
ficials have switched the Duke Univer-
sity-Davidson game on February 10th
from Davidson to Charlotte. The game
will be played on the Central High court,
scene of the Carolina-Davidson tilt some
time ago.

Last winter it was necessary to turn
away many of the fans who flocked to
see the Wildcats and Blue Devils clash,
and early indications are that even a
greater throng will be anxious to see Duke
‘and Davidson meet this winter, The re-
markable team representing the Meth-
odists this season, and the fast outfit in
the Red and Black uniform will attract
state-wide attention, and a tremendous
crowd is expected to be in‘the seats to
see the struggle.

The Wildcats won from Duke when
they played at Davidson last year. The
Blue Devils have almost the same team
that succumbed to the onslaught of the
Davidson quintet. The Wildcats likewise
have almost the same five who conquered
the Blue Devils, and so the contest should
be worth seeing from several angles. This
is the second “Big Five” team that David-
son will encounter, having already defeat-
ed‘Carolina, and will thus have a record
of one victory and no defeats in the
state when the Wildcats trot upon the
floor, next Monday night.

How They Stand in

Intramural Compe-
tition
The Senior Class now boasts a
wide margin in the Intramural
sports competition on the campus.
They have thus far scored forty
points, and have neither lost or tied
a single event. The second place is
evenly tied by the Junior, Sopho-
more, and Freshman classes, each
having twenty points.

Wildcats Overcome
Maryville Quint By
Great Uphill Battle

Beaten in First Half, Wildcats
Stage Thrilling Rally

Lead by Pritchett, Rusk and Goodson,
the Davidson Wildcats staged a sensation-
al rally in the second half of their game
with Maryville College last Wednesday
night and came off on the long end of a
33 to 20 score. After being outplayed
throughout the entire first period by their
opponents the Wildcats’ came back in the
last stanza to overtake their opponents
and pile up a safe lead before the Tenn-
esseans were able to, score.

The Maryville man-for-man defense
gave Davidson plenty of trouble during the
early part of the game. The locals were
unable to fathom it, and could drop in
only two field goals. Three free shots ran
the total for the half up to seven points,
while Maryville was amassing twice as
many during the same period. However,
what Monk Younger said, or"didn’'t say,
had the desired effect on his pupils and
they came back looking like an entirely
different team. Soon the count had been
knotted, passed, and then the Wildcats
kept on going. Their defense which had
been looking like the well-known sieve,
tightened up effectively, and held their
opponents to two lone field goals.

Dean Rusk and Davis, of Maryville,
tied for high point honors, each getting
ten points. Rusk played one of the best
games he has turned in this year. Carl
Pritchett did not start the game but went
in during the first half and got eight
points in the second period. Bill Goodson
and Jimmy Proctor played their usual
good games at guard, and Frontis John-
ston gave his opponents plenty of trouble
when they tried to pierce the center of
the Wildcat defense.

Davidson proved to be the big gun of
his team’s offense. Besides getting half
the points made, he played a jam-up de-
fensive game. Woodard also turned in a
nice gaine,

Members Of Two Upper
| Classes Now Privileged
| To Choose Own Exercise

Captain Pritchett Urges All Men to
Take Part in Competitive
Gymnastic Exercises

| In view of the fact that the did Armory
lis too small to care for all the under-
graduates who wish to benefit from its
facilities, Capt. Norton G. Pritchett, ath-
letic director, has discontinued the bi-
weekly exercises which were held for
Juniors and Seniors during the first sem-
ester, chiefly because it interrupts the
gymnastic performances of other students
|as well as the boxing practices, which are
now under way.

This leaves it optional. for the members
of the two upper classes to choose the na-
ture of their exercises as well as the time
of their work, so long as they conform to
the two-hours-a-week. requirement.

Captain Pritchett had intended to have
a 20-minute period of calisthenics daily
but even this project was disrupted be-
cause it was found that the plan would
interfere with the work of others. The
athletic director also explained that much
of his time from now on will be spent on
the athletic field in the interest of the
track squad.

He emphasized that he would be glad to
arrange a suitable hour for men who are
unable to come out and exercise in the
afternoons, because of curricular or other
obstacles, if they will come to him with
their difficulties.

“Concerning the competitive gymnastic
exercises for the individual cup, | would
like te suggest that more men come out
and try to win the trophy. A great num-
ber of men who have the so-called “in-
feriority. complex,” should discard it en-
tirely and try to compete with therest.

“Not only will it give the prospective
candidate a chance for the cup, but will
increase the standing of his class at tne
end of the year, as well as the derivation
of physical benefit for the individual! him-
self,” Captain Pritchet appealed.

Neyer be satisfied with anything less. First,

Intramural Events

Halted By Weather

Due to exam week and the heavy snow
since that time, activity in® intramural
sports has come to a temporary halt.
However, ‘two events, campus football,
and basketball have been completed; the
Senior Class emerging with forty points,
and the Junior, Sophomore, and Fresh-
man Classes with twenty each. The re-
maining events in the intramural series
are: volley ball, track, baseball, gymnas-
tics, tennis, golf, boxing, and Sigma Delta
Psi competition,

Should the present bad weather con-
tinue much longer, according to Captain
Pritchett, a temporary court will be fixed
in the gymnasium for the volley ball
event, which is next in order. |

Several of the gymnastic events will be
run off this week, if possible. In this com-
petition, the twenty highest scores will be
taken, and the class percentages will be
determined by the proportion of their
respective men representing. The man
winning the highest number of points
will receive a handsome cup.

Competition in the Sigma Delta Psi
events will be run off in like manner. Be:
sides the presentation of a trophy to the
highest scorer, the second and third high-
est will receive keys and certificates to
Sigma Delta Psi, without having to pay
the ten dollar membership fee.

Further details may be had by refer-
ence to the bulletin board in the athletic
building. All men interested are urged to
get in shape before it is too late.
