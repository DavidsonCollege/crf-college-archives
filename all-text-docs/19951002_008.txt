The rankings plummet:
A parent’s perspective

Davidson College’s #21 rank-
ing in the U.S. News and. World
Report college poll has apparently
generated a lot of discussion on
campus. As the parent of an appli-
cant to the Class of 2000, I would
like to share my thoughts with the
Davidson community.

My daughter is looking closely
at four colleges: Amherst,
Dartmouth, Colgate, and of course,
Davidson. Two weekends ago,

Jen (my daughter). and I visited"

Davidson fora second time to learn
more about the .women’s soccer
program and to attend the Dis-
cover Davidson program.
Jen had an oppoftunity to at-
tend classes on Friday, observe
soccer practice, talk with coaches
Kevin Hundley and Brit Soderberg,
‘and meet a few of the players, in
addition to attending information
sessions on Sunday with profes-
sors representing the biology and
French departments.
Based purely on rankings, it’s
a no-brainer that Amherst or
Dartmouth should be her first
choice. However, several intan-

gible factors come into play which
cannot be measured by survey sta-
tistics: the openness and accessi-
bility of the faculty; the feel of the
campus; the fit of the soccef pro-
gram, including the teaching abil-
ity of the coaches; the friendliness
of the students; etc.

Amherst, Dartmouth, and Colgate.
Let’s assume there is no clear cut
“winner.”

Unfortunately, this is the rea-
son why college rankings are some-
what meaningful. If the potential
applicantis undecided, therankings

school students and top employ-
ers.

However, the more critical is-
sue is why the sharp drop from #8
to #21. Although I view the
rankings as an indicator versus a
precise measure, I am

David Grant were par-
ticularly impressive at the Sunday
biology information session. The
telephone calls and face-to-face

‘discussions we have had with

coaches Hundley and Soderberg
have been positive and honest. The
students are intelligent and friendly,
the campus is beautiful, and there
seems to be a strong sense of com-
munity with the town. From what
I’ve observed, Davidson is an out-
standing institution — but so are

may serve as a tie-breaker. As a
Colgate alumnus, I am speaking
from experience when [I say that
Davidson suffers from a recogni-
tion problem, as did Colgate (“‘Isn’t
that where they make tooth-
paste?’”’),

Many high school guidance
counselors and prospective em-
ployers outside the South do not
know the Davidson name. At #21
on the charts, the college may not

The above com-
ments are interesting but not all
that actionable. I have many sug-
gestions for you to consider but in
the ‘interest of space I will high-
light two:

1.) The endowments per stu-
dent at Amherst and Dartmouth
are huge when compared to
Davidson. Realistically, schools
like Colgate and Davidson cannot
compete in the arena of financial
aid and merit scholarships due to

financial constraints. The alumni
“giving rate” at Davidson needs to
increase, and I think current stu-
dents and alumni need to work on
this issue immediately to improve
the school’s ability to attract top
students and faculty. The #21 rank-
ing should serve as a call to action!

2.) The faculty is clearly
Davidson’s greatest resource, and
I believe they can make a major
difference in attracting first-rate
students from across the country. I
am convinced that if the professors
(on a volunteer basis) selectively
“recruit” high school guidance
counselors and top high school stu-
dents throughout the country,
Davidson’s national reputation will
improve.

In closing, view the college
rankings as an opportunity for im-
provement. Remember, whether
your college is ranked #8 or #21, I
doubt if anything of substance has
changed from one day to the next.

I would not trade my four years
at Colgate for anything in the world;
Ihope you feel the same way about
your Davidson experience.

Homecoming:

the date ritual

As part of a new series on the
mating rituals of Davidson stu-
dents, this week’s article focuses
on homecoming. For keen observ-
ers of Davidson student life, home-
coming is definitely the most fas-
cinating event of the year. Without
a doubt, the most interesting as-
pect of the homecoming festivities
occurs before the actual weekend
festivities: getting a date.

Basically, date-getting trans-
forms a large number of both sexes
on campus into complete idiots.
There’s no mincing words here.
There’s no way to get around it. If
you wanta date, you have to go out
a lot, make cocktail party conver-
sation to the right people, and avoid

unsavory members of the opposite
sex. In other words, it bares the
raw, Machiavellian social tactics
you haven’ t put into full force since
middle school.

If you’re a guy, you have to
time your approach so as not to ask
adate too early. Early asking equals
eagerness; jumping the gun could
give your prospective date, whom
you probably only sort-of-like, the
impression that you really like her.

That spells danger. Second of all,

you have to appear clean and pre-
sentable but not noticeably differ-
ent than prior weeks.

would get along with your friends
at dinner and who would get along
with your friends’ dates. For fresh-
man, you have to figure out if you
even know any members of the
opposite sex. This all takes some

_ thought and planning. .Of course,

if you’re PiKA you just ask some-
one Friday morning.

For the women students on
campus, the game is a little differ-
ent. (A discussion of why we only
have male-oriented schoolwide
date functions is another beast al-
together. Personally, I think both
sexes have it just as bad during
homecoming. However, as some
recourse, eating house members
do reverse homecoming roles at

other date functions later in the
fall.) While the guys have to ap-
pear to nonchalantly ask, we have
tononchalantly wait. This involves
going out to Court parties, going to
the library and sitting in a high
traffic area, wearing matching
clothes, saying hito selected people
in the halls, and making inane con-
versation in the Union Café. This
is all in the ridiculous attempt to
appear fun and laid back — the
perfect 48 hour date. However, in
our favor, women also have huge
veto power. Although this is rarely
exercised, it is a formidable scare
tactic. Of course, I won’t give out
any secrets of how it can be done,
but justremember, guys, never use

voice mail, and if she says she’ll
think about it, you’re in trouble.

This year, homecoming prom-
ises to be as entertaining as ever.
However, remember, it is compli-
cated by Fall Break. Because this
vacation essentially discounts the
week before homecoming, the date
asking period will most definitely
begin earlier. In fact, Ihave it from
a reliable source that it started on
Sunday night. Still, some guys
will inevitably forget to ask a date
before the break and realize this on
the Thursday before homecoming
during their 10:30 class. Don’t
worry, you still have hope; there’s
always Ladies Lock-In on Thurs-
day night!

The art of doing nothing

People at this school need to
relax. I realize this subject was
touched on earlier by my room-
mate, Jack “chill like a fan”
Slosson, but I do not feel people
have taken Mr. Chill like a fan’s
advice to heart. Obviously, the
academic climate here creates
enough stress for two or three life-
times. However, I feel the high
tension level stretches far beyond
the famed walls of chambers.
Davidson places an incredible pres-
sure on its students through the
Honor Code, the Code of Respon-

sibility, the renowned Davidson
workload, the pressure to succeed
after school, and the gung ho “work
hard, play hard” mentality. Com-
ing from Davidson you are sup-
posed to be perfect; the ideal
Davidson student never lies, never
damages things, always studies
when it is time for studying and
always blows off steam when it is
time to blow off steam.
Everything we do here is
strictly regimented in categories.
People feel that if they are not
doing one thing they must engage

in another. What’s wrong with
doing nothing every once and a
while?

Let’s be realistic. Nobody—
not even a Davidson student—is
perfect. Davidson’s rigorous
agenda has proven its worth in
creating ambitious, motivated
people who are ready to conquer
the world when they graduate. But
at the same time, students here
often get the impression that every
ounce of time is precious and must
not be wasted on idle activity. A
common Davidson student bears

an expression of discomfort and
anxiety when forced to sit and do
nothing.

Time is precious, very pre-
cious, but setting aside time to
lounge on a lawn during a pleasant
fall day or relax on a couch with no
particular goal are just as impor-

tant for mental health as studying °

for a test, practicing for a sport, or
working on an art project.

As one who has realized that I
will never get a job based on my
grades, chilling out and working
on my personalityis my only op-

tion. But for those of you who have
not worked out doing nothing to an
art form, I suggest you try it just a
little. Itclears your mind and makes
you a more enjoyable person to be
around.

Seriously, who do you think
members of the opposite sex would
be more likely to date, a regi-
mented, anal, study-crazy person,
or a suave, personable, relaxed |
person. If you answered the former °
then you need serious work. Just
try the nothing thing--if not for
yourself, then for the rest of us.
