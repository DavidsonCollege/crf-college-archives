Senior Gift
Is Subject
Of Smoker

Several Suggestions Are Dis-
cussed But No Decision Is
Reached

Members of the Senior Class dis-
cussed possible class gifts at their
smoker held last. Tuesday night.

One of the gifts suggested was
that of building a walk to the fra-
ternity court. Another suggestion,
one that came up as a possibility
for last year's senior class gift, was
to have a curb built around the
cinder path in the stadium. The
Davidsonian suggestion of begin-
ning an athletic scholarship fund
was brought up also.as well as the
possibility of creating a living en+
dowment fund. f

Another topic of the meeting was
whether to repeat the senior-facul-
ty day this year. On that day mem-
bers of the senior class have ath-
letic contests of various kinds in
competition with members of the
faculty. The day would end with a
barbecue. It was announced that
the annual senior-faculty discus-
sion smoker will probably be held
next month.

Last year the Senior’ class gave
as its gift a large clock which was
just recently installed on the south
end of Chambers building. It is an
exact duplicate of the clock which
faces dormitory row on the north
end of Chambers. Both ‘clocks are
illuminated at night.

The committee in charge of
blazers for the rising senior class
has made arrangements to have
several samples on display at the

The class of 1941 is the first
to buy blazers before the senior

Gales McClintock’s announcement in chapel last Tuesday morning
brought to light a situation which, if it is as widespread as the
facts would seem to indicate, is certainly a reflection on the general
honor of the Davidson student body.

While anyone must realize that. the practice of not fully paying
for purchases at the student store does not include everyone, it looks
as if it must include many. When McClintock and Richmond find
three men who are taking more than they pay for in a short time,
it indicates that this is done rather generally.

Our honor system is one of the strong points of the school. In
the past years, and this yaer, it is our sincere belief that it has been
a high point in Davaiion's system, but this incident tends to prove

However, in all fairness it must be said that while the facts
point to widespread “under-payment” at the student store, this may
not be so general as it now seems. On the other hand if it is a
common practice among the students, it is a vice that must be
stopped now. Perhaps some men don’t realize it, but taking more
than one pays for at the Student Store is just as much stealing
as if one took the money out of the cash register, for that is what
it amounts to, and as everyone knows stealing comes under our
Hence System, and can be punished by the Student Council as
such,

it is our hope that once the evil has been pointed out it will
not happen again in the future. To our mind the thing was started

by those who ate and left without paying, but with full intent to
return at some later time and pay in full. Technically this is also
stealing, and, as it leads to worse habits, should be stopped also.

Once the evil has been poi out it sh
