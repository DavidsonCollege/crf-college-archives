Farewell Address Was Made by Presi-
dent of Senior Class

On last Thursday evening at 6 o'clock, the
newly elected student body officers for 1932-33
were formally installed with Jack McKinnon,
president of the retiring Senior class, acting as
master of ceremonies. Bill Hart, organist, ren-
dered a short organ recital prior to the exer-
cises.

The student body sang “O Davidson,” after
which the invocation was given by Sam Wiley
of the Senior class. Following this, Don King
led the retiring council up the left side of the
stage, while Jerome Clark led the incoming
council up the right side. Both councils re-
mained standing while the oath was adminis-
tered to the new council. The following were
installed: Jerome Clark, Allan Mebane, Bruce
Peabody, Duncan McBryde, Gene Cannon, Bob
Glasgow, and John Howard, all of the rising
Senior class; Harold McMillan, Jim. McClin-
tock, Julian West, and Bill Johnson, of the ris-
ing Junior class; Gordon Brown, Duke Glas-
gow, and Fred McPhail, all of the rising Soph-
omore class.

Don King made a brief talk, thanking the
stydent body for their loyal support and co-
operation during the past year. Clark also made

a talk. The two councils then filed off the stage

leaving Clark, King and McKinnon.

John Howard, vice-president of the Y. M
C. A.; Buck Mills, vice-president of the Ath
letic Association; Grier Martin, editor of the
Davidsonian; Ned Dwelle, editor of the An-
nual, and Vereen Bell, editor of the Yowl, then
conferred their obligations and responsibilties
upon the following men, respectively: Paul
Brown, president-elect of the Y. M. C. A.;
Charlie Pearce, president-elect of the Athletic
Association; Ed Guerrant, editor-elect of the
Davidsonian; Bob McCallie, editor-elect of the
Quips and Cranks, and Rives Pope, editor-
elect of the Yowl. Each of the retiring officers
in their speeches made remarks to the effect
that they appreciated the manner in which= the

Allan Frew Gives Talk
At Vespers Last Sunday

Speaker Used “Steadfastness” as the
Theme of Evening Address

One of the most delightful speakers invited
to speak this year by the “Y” cabinet was Mr.
Allan Frew, minister of the “Church by the
Side of the Road.” He is a very forceful speak-
er, having won third place in the National
American Legion oratorical contest, and first
place in the state trials, while in school. He
is a graduate of Davidson College. Some of
his honors while here were membership in
O. D. K., president of the Freshman class, and
a member of the “Y” cabinet.

His complete message dwelt around the cen-
tral idea of ‘“Steadfastness.” He opened his
speech by saying that he felt at home and “was
most grateful to be allowed the privilege of
coming hereto think through a problem which
is confronting the youth of Christ today.” His
text was taken from the Gospel of Luke, ninth
chapter, “And when the days were well nigh
come, that he should be received up, he stead-
fastly set his face to go to Jerusalem.” Jesus
was steadfast throughout His whole life. When
at the age of twelve He was asked why He
stayed at the temple, and He answered, “Know
ye not that I must be about my Father's busi-
ness?’ Many men of today who have become
famous have worked steadily to gain their po-
sitions. In the great war, while Joffre, com-
mander-in-chief, was in the thick of the battle,
in one of his letters to a friend, remarked, ““We
must keep steadfastly pressing the army.” Pas-
teur, the great French. bacteriologist, had to
bé forced at first to attend school, but later be-
came very interested and worked steadfastly

After the business meeting, the new mem-
bers gave three skits. The first of these was
a graveyard scene by Rachal and Easton. There
followed a dialogue between Paul Brown and
Jack Williams, entitled “Brother Bill’ They
both did their parts well. The final presentation
was a deep tragedy, suggestively entitled,
“Pansy of Patagodia” or “Love Suffers.”

In this, Klooster and Hollingsworth were at-
tired as native Honolulu lovers. They suddenly
dashed into the room in an amorous, frenzied
dance. Hollingsworth, with a Greta Garbo ac-
cent, refused to marry Klooster until he was
sixty. The plot thickens when Hodgin enters
as an Americano. Klooster, returning, finds them
on the point of embarking for America. En-
raged, he stabs Greta Hollingsworth and is in
turn slain by Hodgin, who melodraniatically
stalks off the stage, smoking a Murad. :

This was the last official meeting of the year
for the Masquers.

Final Plans For Summer
Session Are Announced

Admission Requirements Are Same as
for Regular Session

Continuing the plan of last year, the trustees
of Davidson College have authorized a summer
session, beginning June 6 and ending July 15,
1932. The requirements for admission are the
same as those of the regular session; all the
courses offered are of college grade and char-
acter and are so recognized by the college.

College credits for summer school work are
given in terms of semester hours; a semester
hour is the equivalent of one recitation hour a
week for a college semester. Six semester hours
represent the maximum credit allowed a college
student for six weeks. AN courses given are
identical in content and credit with those de-
scribed in the regular catalogue of the college.

The daily assembly will be a vital part of
the devotional
exercises and instructive talks, it is one of the

summer session, consisting of
stimulating and unifying forces of the school.
Daily announcement reports are important, es-
pecially in a school with an intensive program
and with an organization in which any change
is likely to affect the work throughout the
school, Because of this vital relationship be-
tween the daily assembly and the other work of
the summer session, as well as because we plan
to make the assembly period worth while on
its own account, all students are required to
attend the assembly as in the regular session.

For recreation the gymnasium, the athletic
field, the tennis courts of the college, and the
golf links of the Davidson College Golf Club
are available. me 4 '
