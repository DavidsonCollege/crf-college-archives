“

Spencer, WDAV attempt to clear air

By PHILIP DUNCAN
News Editor

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. met this week with
the staff and Board of Direc-
tors of WDAV to ‘‘correct
some of the misconceptions
about the future of radio
broadcasting at Davidson.”

The college has already
applied to the FCC for permis-
sion to increase the station’s
power to 18,540 watts. Ap-
proval is expected by March 1.

Expansion and improve-
ment of the station’s technical
equipment will likely be neces-
sary when the wattage is in-
creased. Staffing and prog-
ramming changes are also
being considered.

Some WDAV staff members
felt that the administration
was neglecting students input
while formulating ideas for
WDAV’s future.

““We were apprehensive
simply because we were hear-
ing several different stories
about plans for WDAV,”’ said
Station Manager Sid Barrett.

“It is my understanding
that at this time there is no set
plan of what this 18,000 watt
station will be like,’ he con-
tinued.

Barrett and other represen-
tatives from WDAV ques-
tioned Spencer about several
matters—the college’s imme-:
diate and long-term plans for
funding the station, the degree
of student involvement on the
new high-power station, and
the type of programming the
station would broadcast.

‘The capital expenditure
according to the figures that
Buck (Lawrimore) has given
me would involve an initial
outlay of $52,000,” said Spen-
cer.

Director of Communications
Lawrimore commented: ‘‘Add
a little over $18,000 for im-
provements in the studio—
additional tape recorders, and
so forth—and that takes it up
to $70,000. Then automation
will cost $30-35,000 if we
decide to add it.

But $52,000— probably
even $50,000 is all we need to
go from where we are nowto
high power,” said Lawrimore.

‘‘And of course operating
costs figure in,’”’ said Spencer.
“They will depend upon what
we do with the station.

“In terms of ‘getting back’
the money, so to speak, we’re
not interested just in the
number of contributions we
might bring in.

‘‘We’re also interested in
providing a service to the
whole region which would
have an impact for Davidson
College,”’ said Spencer.

“Do you feel that for the
full-time operation of the sta-
tion you will draw as much as
you can from the students?”’
asked Barrett.

“That has been my assump-

tion all along,’’ Spencer re-
plied.

Operations Manager Bill
Burkholder pointed out that
WDAYV presently programs
classical, jazz, folk, rock, and
bluegrass music.

Barrett emphasized that
‘“‘with careful training and
programming, the students’
taste could provide the alter-
native that isn’t being played
right now in Charlotte.

‘“‘And as long as the stu-
dents. can program their mus-
ic, within a reasonable degree
of creativity, you can count on
their enthusiasm,’’ said Bar-
rett.

“Some difficult decisions

have to be made,”’ said past
Station Manager Jack Golden.

“What we really need to do
is make concrete proposals—
one from the students, one
from the administration —then
practice the good old Amer-
ican principle of give-and-
take.

Spencer reasserted that
Lawrimore would serve as his
liaison in all future dealings
with the board and students
regarding WDAV.

“T. will over-communicate,”’
promised Lawrimore.

‘“‘T have kept a low profile
with the understanding that
we wanted to do that. Part of
the problem came with the

turnover of staffs at election-
time.

“T never stopped. and
thought: ‘Well, now, we’ve
got a new station manager and
I need to tell Sid everything
that Jack knew.’©

“T'll accept responsibility
for that .communications

‘‘We will keep everybody
over-informed to make sure
there are no misunderstand-
ings,” said Lawrimore.

The station’s Board of Dir-
ectors agreed to meet at the
beginning of spring. term to
discuss and determine final
proposals for high-power
WDAV.

Arts and crafts center on creativity

By STEPHANIE COOK
Staff Writer

Tucked away in an alcove
above the TV Lounge in the
Union is Davidson’s Arts and
Crafts Center, providing ano-
ther dimension for student
activity.

Arts and Crafts Committee
Chairman John Trout dis-
cussed some of the goals of the
center.

‘‘We hope to provide a
varied, non-academic release-
type program for students...to
give them something to do
besides studying.

‘«...Perhaps the Arts and
Crafts Committee can bring
out some of the creativity in
students that school tends to
stifle.”’ :

At the present, the center’s
focus is on pottery and sculp-
ture. There are two kickwheels
and a kiln, purchased last year
with committee funds.

Tim Bonsack conducts in-
formal pottery lessons from 10
to 12 Monday nights, al-
though the center is always.
available for student use (the
key is at the Union desk). In
the area of sculpture}: John

Evans has been helping stu-
dents acquire the basic’skills,
and helps out with any prob-
lems they may have later on.

The Arts and Crafts Com-

mittee under the Co-Curricular
Council of the Union Board is
allocated an annual budget
which pays for innovations as
well as for maintaining sup-
plies.

“‘T would like to see the

committee expand into a new
area each year,” Trout said.
This'year, the addition to
the program will be copper
enameling, under the supervi-
sion of John Highsmith. Cop-
per enameling is done by
sifting ground glass (enamel)
onto a copper piece and then
firing it in the kiln, which

STUDENTS can turn to pottery to relieve pressure.

fuses the enamel. This feature
will begin in the spring.

In addition, Captain Kotula
of the Davidson ROTC De-
partment has expressed an
interest in teaching Raku a
couple of weekends in the

(Hunter Jennings)

spring.

Raku is an ancient Japanese
technique of pottery based on
a philosophy of peace and

happiness.

It is a spectacular event,
involving the firing of the
pieces outdoors. Pots are
made in the normal manner
and put in kilns. These kilns
can be made of oil drums, fire
bricks, and a gas burner.

However, instead of letting
the pot cool in the normal
eight-to-ten hour process,
Raku allows for it to be cooled
quickly (in five or ten minutes)
by putting it in water, leaves
or sawdust.

The $700 budget for this
year will provide for enough
chemicals to be bought to
make homemade glazes, and
will hopefully also cover the
charge of materials with which
to make a Raku kiln.

Student involvement is the
key.’ Money does not hamper
the progrdm as much as
finding students who have
time to teach and work with
other students.

The center was well used
last year, according to Trout,
and hopefully, the new ideas
for the future will help stimu-
late student interest as well as
awateriess of the program.
