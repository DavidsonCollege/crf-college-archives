Discrimination in the workplace: In defense of anti-discrimination laws

Ager reading Walt Barron’s ar-
ticle last week, which, in my opin-
ion, essentially justified discrimi-
nation in the workplace on the ba-
sis of an employer’s subjective
preferences, my first inclination
(and somehow I have the feeling

I’m not alone on this) was to’send '
him harassing mail. Instead, Ichose _

to write a response article.
Although I disagree so.

strongly with Mr. Barron’s-views -

that they won’t print the words in

this paper that would describe it, I.

am trying to advocate equal rights
for everyone. As amember of this
great nation, Mr. Barron is entitled
to speak his mind. Now that he’s
done that, however, it’s my turn.
First, then, I: would like to
address the lovely analogy Mr.
Barron made between being fired
for discriminatory reasons and be-
ing treated poorly by a sales clerk

Reality bites.

Hato, gentle readers. This week
I’m not in a very good mood, so
please forgive me if my razor sharp
wit is not up to its usual panache. I

suppose I should let you in on my"

sorrows. Perhaps it will cheer me
up a bit. It seems to work with
those people who constantly talk
about how much work they have.
Or perhaps that’s just an indication
of their small, insignificant lives.

Wow. I’m more bitter than I
thought. Perhaps I should be see-
ing an analyst or something. Let
me get to the point. This week I
have (or had, as you hold this gem
of a paper with your ink-stained
fingers) midterms on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday. I’m not
asking for any consolation for this.
I would trade one week of com-
plete and utter hell for the semester
I’ve had so far. As Tim Sobon
says, “I’d rather have good memo-
ties than good grades.”

My complaint is due to the
fact that my social schedule this
week is not at all what I’ve been
used to. What I am used to is this:
Tuesday night I go to 21-year-old
night at the Union; Wednesday I
pray for a party; Thursday I go to
Back Street; Friday and Saturday
are pretty much filled with wine,
women, and song. Well, not quite.

Perhaps beer, boys, and burps

would be more accurate.

The reason for my sour mood
is that now I have to finally face the
’ fact that my life is almost over. I
now have to go into the cold world
that I’m nowhere near prepared to
deal with. I have nothing to put on
aresume. I can’t get in to graduate
school. I would fail a course on
purpose if this place didn’t cost so
much just soI could put graduation
off for another semester.

With that said,, I’d like to
present a little dilemma following
with Mr. Barron’s logic. If you are

A scientific report came out
the other month showing that beer

Pollack, Peter O’Toole and I would
have to disagree with that one. All
I can think about this week is my
future, and who wants to read about
that? I couldn’t even think of an
original title for this article. I had
to steal one from a movie.

My exercising is going strong.
I’ve been at it for three or four
weeks now, and I look, well, I look
pretty much the same. But that’s
beside the point. I love the weight
room. It’s one of the best places in
the world where people expose
themselves for what they really
are. Most of the men walk around
pretending they’re incredibly
strong and that they’ve been lifting
weights since they were five years
old.

Stephen Faller
On taking a cane

I feel as though I have become the

answer to the great Theban riddle
of the sphinx. I have recently taken
up my cane and walked, much of
which I owe to the encouragement
of a good friend. On the whole, it
has been a good experience, but
more importantly, it has been an
experience.

There is a novelty to it all, I
must confess. It is almost adoles-
cent and boyish: the delight in
walking with a cane for this first
time. It is like gcquiring a new set
of ears to hear by, and you con-
stantly find yourself testing the
limits of the thing. And it is not
long before you’re snaring people
with the hook end or trying to twirl
it like a baton, perhaps as a way to
show off or impress someone. As
if cane proficiency was a high and
holy skill!

It takes a strange perspective
to walk somewhere these days. I
find myself in eternal need of re-
minding myself that there is a quali-
tative implication of old Ralph’s
self-reliance. There is a very real
difference between applying one-
self so directly to life that you are
deliberately savoring each moment
passionately and not applying
much to anything except getting as
much done as possible. Except

that the ability to walk can become
as much of a curse as it is a bless-
ing. Sosoon, one bitterly becomes

resentful of each step, just wishing

for the whole enterprise to come to
an end.

But the trees! The trees! And
the flowers!

The question of dignity is a
nebulous one. It might seem that I
am merely uncomfortable with my
role as a hyphenated person. Hy-
phenated people are not new, only
in my case it becomes something
like: wheelchair-student, or dis-
abled-person, or some other such
mauling of what it means to be
human. The role of the hyphen-
ated person is always, necessarily
so, a qualification of the human
experience. In all cases I can think
of, especially mine, the qualifica-
tion is a hobbling one, socially and
otherwise.

I believe it means something
to walk. There is poetry in it. And
if the gait is prompt, assertive, sexy,
or even three-legged, there is still
dignity in it. It may be a false
dignity, foolish and vain. Is there
a frivolity in uprightness? It might
be that walking is dignified be-
cause it lifts us above the earth, if

senior class? I sure don’t.

. Inaddition, Mr. Barron thinks
it is also okay to fire someone for
discriminatory reasons because,
after all, why would you want to
work for soméone whi didn’t like
you? ’ Well, I see we’re back to
square one.

Wake up. These days, people
take what they can get. The bulk of
this country’s population is out
there just trying to survive. The
eighties are over. No more yachts
and BMWs and Evian-on-tap. I’m
not saying the whole country is
broke, but I am saying that those
with the means are becoming fewer
and fewer as the years goby. These
days, it’s enough for most people
to be able to make rent and put food
on the table.

I don’t want everyone whose

Gull's Nest: Bill Gullan

Chalk one up
for Davidson.

“ey have fought a good fight, I
have finished my course, I have
kept the faith.” (II Timothy 4:7)
The faith was kept in the
lounges of residence halls, in off-
campus living rooms, in the seats

in Asheville, and everywhere else

a Davidson fan might have been
last Sunday night. Squabbles about
politics, tax forms, Christianity,
and callousness were put aside as
the Davidson world screeched to a
halt and just watched.

What did we all see? A group
of men, banded together in pursuit
of a goal, proving themselves to be
a success on the basketball court
and in the game of life.

Was Quinn fouled in the act of
shooting? Did those final two sec-
onds slip away after the whistle?
Where will the Wildcats be next
Sunday? Is Chad Copeland the
next Rogaine poster boy?

Regardless of the answers to
these questions, the Davidson
Wildcats were winners Sunday
night. They played great basket-
ball, displayed commendable
sportsmanship, and represented
themselves and this institution ex-
traordinarily well. The ESPN an-
nouncers knew nothing about our
school. There was no mention of
our small size. There was no men-
tion of our high academic stan-
dards and commitment to honor.

The only way an uninitiated
viewer might learn about Davidson
College—our mission and our es-
sence—was by watching our bas-
ketball team. And no glossy Ad-
missions Office brochure could
have possibly captured the spirit,
hopes, and dreams of Davidson
better than that group of twelve
men.

I remember the 1982-83
NCAA final where Georgetown
lost a tragic game to Chapel Hill.

ently threw the ball to the wrong
