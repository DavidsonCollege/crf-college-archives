Should the Stars and Bars Fly on Davidson Campus?

By Alex Crumbley

AsI walked down the hill from
my music class in Cunningham, I
noticed something hanging in a
window inLittle, something which
is notarare sight in dorm rooms at
-Davidson oranywhere in the South.
That something was a Confederate
battle flag, or, as many call it, the
rebel flag.

I thought immediately about
the controversy surrounding the
Confederate flags which two stu-
dents hung from their dorm win-
dows at Harvard in 1991, quickly
provoking a racial confrontation.
Their demonstration of the stars
and bars provoked protest marches,
sit-ins, forums and newspaper edi-
torials. The Harvard administra-
tion and most of the student body
condemned their display of the flag
and urged the students to remove

it, but the two students refused,
invoking the first amendment.

Then I considered the flag
which I beheld before me here at
Davidson, and I wondered why no
one seemed to care. When I asked
afriend this question, heresponded
matter-of-factly, “Because we’re
in the South.” Period.

One reason for the acceptance
of the Confederate flag at Davidson
is geography.. Unlike more liberal
schools up North, Davidson is ina
part of the country where the Con-
federate flag is more thanaccepted.
The Confederate flag flies over the
South Carolina state capitol in
Columbia, and it has been part of
the Georgia state flag since the
1950s. Obviously, state govern-
ments in the South not only con-
done the display of the flag but
consider ita partof Southern pride,

“Aw, dude, I’m sorry. I was

ishes from his face. He considers.
.. “OK man, justdon’t letithappen
again,” he says.

Just like that, you’re off the
hook. Why? Because everyone
has, at one time or another, done
something really, really stupid
when they were drunk.

So when you say, “Aw, dude
...”, their conscience pipes up and
says, “Remember that time you. .
. At least this guy didn’t sink that
low.” And the perpetrator is for-
given. Tocome clean here, I must
admit that I myself have, on occa-

I’msorry. I was drunk.” You pass.
(But be forewarned - the one
situation where you should never,
EVER use this excuse is after

you’ ve been pulled over for speed- -

ing.) So that’s the end of the ar-
ticle. I don’t mean to condone
drinking or drunkenness, just to
help out those who find themselves
in dire need of an excuse. But if I
offend, “Aw, dude...” You know
the rest.

a symbol for all to behold and
admire.

Presently, the governor of
Georgia, Zell Miller, is leading a
movement away from this view-
point, introducing a bill into the
Georgia assembly to change the
state flag from its Confederate vis-
age to a design which resembles
the white and red bars on the North
Carolina flag. Although many
people agree with Zell and show it
by such radical methods as bum-
ing the Georgia flag, his efforts
will probably fail. The legislature
will most likely vote the bill to
referendum, and the majority of
Georgia voters want to leave the
flag the way it is.

The debate about the Georgia
flag consists of two basic argu-
ments. Those who want to change
itsay thatitoffends African-Ameri-

cans sees the Confederacy
fought under this flag to keep their
ancestors enslaved. Those who
want to leave it say that one, the
“War of Northern Aggression” was
not fought over slavery, and two,
the flag is a symbol for Southern
pride, not a symbol for racism.

Of course, there are people
who do consider the Confederate
flag asymbol for racism and like it
for that reason. I hope that people
who have the rebel flag in their
rooms at Davidson do not fall into
this category.

One simple truth is the pri-
mary cause for tension over the
Confederate flag: two people can
look at the same object and see two
completely different things. Two
sides of the argument are justified.
So what do we do? In a system
such as ours, the majority decides

what to do. But that’s not neces-
sarily right.

Ihave a Georgia flag hanging
in my room. I put it up neither out
of Southern pride nor as a racial
affront. I put it up because I am
from Georgia. No one has ever
told me that it offended him, but if
someone did, I would take it down
and hope that Gov. Miller is suc-
cessful this spring in changing it.
.  Ifnoone has ever complained
to the person in Little about her
display of the rebel flag, that’s
fine. But if someone asks her to
remove it, I would urge her to
comply. In a small, intellectual
community like Davidson, it’s not
a matter of pride or prejudice, po-
litical correctness or the first
amendment. It’s a matter of per-
sonal respect, understanding, and
above all, courtesy.

Lazenby Responds
to Ambroise Article

By Will Lazenby

To answer your question, Miss
Ambroise, nobody. Nobody died
and left me the judge. The oppor-
tunity of judgment does not neces-
sitate a death. It simply requires a
set of values, an opinion, and a
place to voice that opinion, such as
anewspaper. That’s why I’m go-

ing to begin this response by tell-”

ing you that I am judging the ideas
in your article, not from a “high
chair,” but as a peer and fellow
Student.

First, I don’t think too many
Davidson students “worship the
devil.” Do we sin? Sure. Do we
drink? You bet— we’re college
students. Are we hypocrites?
Sometimes. Do we wear penta-
grams, sacrifice animals, and van-
dalize the church? Nope, not since
I’ve been here. C’mon, Marilyn.
Devil worshipers? You need to
rethink the “high chair” thing. Or
is the air up there too thin for clear
thinking?

Second, the validity of your
comparison of African-Americans
to homosexuals is questionable.
You say that homosexuals “don’t
just wake up and decide to be gay.”
But some do. Yes, some people
are involuntarily homosexual, but
there are other people who choose
tobe gay. As you pointed out, such

isnot the case with color. Soto say
that you “empathize with homo-
sexuals” because, as an African
American, you “know what it is
like to be discriminated against for
something” you “have no control
over” istomakean irrelevant point.

Lastly, your article is teeming
with hypocrisy. Youcriticize those
supposedly “good Christians” for
judging others. Isn’t that what
you’re doing? Aren’t you judging
them? Christians are instructed to
love everyone, but does that mean
that Christians should find no fault
in anyone? How can you say that
it’s alright for an atheist to speak
out against homosexuality and not
a Christian? People can still love
each other and disagree at the same
time. A Christian can love a ho-
mosexual and still find fault with
homosexuality.

You say that as “God’s chil-
dren” it’s “vital that we getalong.”
Do you think that calling people
Satan worshipers promotes good
relations? You come off as very
high and mighty in this piece.

Come down a little so you don’t

have to squint. -You might see
thingsa little better, and you might
realize that, according to yourown
reasoning, you have as little right

‘ to judge those “good Christians”

as they do to judge homosexuals.

The Green
Has Left
the Red

and Black

By Nathan Seay

I’m what may be considered a
lime green person. I like the idea
of saving the world and all, but my
laziness gets in the way of my good
intentions. Inwardly, I cringe when
I throw potentially recyclable
things away, but not quite bad
enough to walk down four flights
of stairs:and hunt all over campus
in the rain for a place to put my
empty Snapple bottle.

(Nostalgia time) Two years
ago, there were recycle bins strewn
all over every dorm; buckets just
begging for your recyclables. You
had to be a paralyzed sloth (or a
near comatose partier) if you
couldn’t throw all your empties in
one of those pink bins. And if you
were too lazy to walk five steps
down the hall, youcould even steal
one and put it in your room; there
were plenty of extras.

Now, I don’t have any idea
what to do with the pile of newspa-
pers rapidly taking overone corner
of my room. Does anybody know
where I can put this stuff? Some-
where close by, I hope. Is there
even a recycling committee any
more?

I was informed that the reason
for the removal of recycling bins
from the dorms was because of fire
precautions. That makes sense. I
read an article in Scientific Ameri-
can that said when aluminum cans
containing beer dregs and dip spit
are rubbed together with soggy
newspapers, spontaneous combus-
tion occurs.

I don’t think that I’m alone in
my limeness. You only must look
at the trash cans in the bathrooms
to understand the amount of recy-
clable material that goes straightto
the landfills from this campus.
Recycling at Davidson would in-
