Cat sailors breezetosecond,
expect championship berth.

By BRAD SWALWELL
Senior News Editor

The Davidson College Sail-
ing Team fought shifting
winds and breezed to an easy
second place finish at a confer-
ence eliminations regatta on
Lake Monticello last weekend.

Seven teams participated in
this the second in a series of
three conference elimination
regattas. Old Dominion Uni-
versity edged out Davidson
for first place, with the
University of Virginia trailing
Davidson by six points to
wind up in:third position.

The top three teams easily
handled the remaining four
schools, as Duke University,
North Carolina State Univer-
sity, the University of North
Carolina, and Christopher
Newport College all finished
far behind the leaders.

Team captain Dave Francis
commented on the difficulties
the team encountered with the
changing winds. ‘The weather
was nice and warm, but the
winds varied, running between
five and 15 miles an hour
during the day.

“The winds shifted due to
the size of the lake and its
irregular shape. The course
was easy to figure out, but the
wind strength made for a
rough day’s sailing,’’ said
Francis.

Francis sailed five of the six
A Division races, with Laurie
Bingaman as crew. Francis

picked up three second places
and two thirds in his five
races.

Greg Eason sailed the last A
Divison race for Davidson and
took third place. Dave Love
crewed for Eason in the race.

“Virginia walked away with
A Division,’’ commented
Francis. “Billy Ball, the Vir-
ginia skipper, sailed third in
the first race, but pulled five
straight firsts in the remaining
A Division races.

“By points, he pretty well
dominated everybody. But
during the races, we were all in
contention. He won a couple of
races when the breaks went
against us.’

“Christopher Newport, true
to form, finished last in every
single race,’’ he said.

Davidson’s B Division boat
was skippered. by Chuck
Barrineau, with Stuart Camp-
bell as crew. The B Division
team placed second, finishing
four points behind the winning
Old Dominion team.

“Old Dominion’s B skipper,
Bill Cofer, -sailed incredibly.
He sailed first in the first race,
had a bye in the second, and
won the third race,’’ said
Francis.

Barrineau ran into bad luck
in the fifth B Division race.
‘“‘Chuck was leading in the
fifth race by half of a leg. He
had just won the fourth race
by a full leg of the course.

“Then he sailed into a hole.

A hole is a spot on the lake
where there is absolutely no
wind. To top it off, he had a
leaky boat that race. The Old
Dominion skipper, who had
turned his boat over at the
very start of the race, caught
and passed Chuck at the
finish,’’ said Francis.

Francis expressed satis-
faction with the team’s
progress. ‘‘It was the best
regatta we’ve sailed in this
year. We are getting more
consistent. We are in second
place in our division, and it
looks like we’ve got a pretty
easy berth to the champion-
ships.”’

Rough play threatens IMAC

By the
THREE FAIRIES

In his first official decree,
new IMAC czar Rozelle
Brown has threatened to can-
cel the remainder of the volley-
ball season after one week of
totally inept play.

The blatant carries, spiking
techniques resembling a Julius
Erving slam-dunk and severe
beatings continually admini-
stered to the nets have given
rise to the fear that all-time,
all-rag, all-IMAC star Larry
Horowitz will be recalled to
referee, thereby guaranteeing
the end of the season.

On opening night, SPE #1
routed Der Schpile 15-9, 4-15,

15-6. Felix Japp’s perform-
ance improved considerably
after he was informed that
only three hits are allowed per
side.

The Jumpin’ Junkies, led by
stud Billy ‘‘Lips’’ McLean
shot down the Dungeon De-
mons 15-1, 13-15, 15-3. _

Another high-powered
squad, Emanon #1 mashed the
Fijis, 15-10, 16-14, as highly
regarded recruit Pat Hickert
proved no match for the
venerable Stretch. However,
earlier in the week Ockham’s
Razor knocked off Emanon in
three games.

#1 managed to defeat the
Beavers in a mutually lack-
luster performance, proving
that beauty and height aren’t
everything.

In girls action, the two jock
teams successfully switched
sports in midair as the Moby
Dicks aced the Sty and Hen-
derson House stuffed 4th
Watts, 15-9, 15-4. The Eaves
used the sound strategy of
getting their serves in to win
matches over 4th and lst
Watts. 4th Watts hurts.

Meanwhile, the bastard pro-
duct of an unnatural act, I
Felta Derby, used the un-
sound strategy of serving into
the net, failing to come from
behind against the powerful
Aintry Squealers, 15-6, 8-15,
15-13.

Finally, the Steamin’ Sea-
men, led by the, burning
thrusts of Blackwood and
Combe, had no problem with
the Wooley Greys, winning
15-7, 15-12. Seaman George
Loy was reportedly accosted
by the Transvestite after the
game: ‘‘Hey, sailor, wanna
drill?’’

The highlight of this week’s
softball action was a new
IMAC record established by
L’il Owslsy second baseman
Pete Johnson, who committed
nine errors in as many chan-
ces, leading his team to a 14-2
defeat against PIKA.

We must apologize for in-
correctly crediting the Wooley
Greys with a victory. over the
Aintry Squealers last week.
We must not apologize to
Mike Gibson, who certainly
had something to do with it.
The sheepish Greys did beat
ETC, 13-3, for sure, we think?
