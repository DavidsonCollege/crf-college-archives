Schaper Shines in
Goal in Loss to UNCG

By Jen Lake

The Davidson women’s soc-
cer team split a pair of games last
week with Coker (a 6-1 win) and
UNC-Greensboro (a 2-0 loss),
proving that itcan put lesser teams
intheir place soundly and also play
on even terms with stiff Division I
competition. The Wildcats hosted’
nationally-prominent UNCG Fri-
day afternoon and fell short in a
close match.

GoalieLiz Schanercontrolied
the box to keep Davidson in the
game, recording 14 saves, The
score was 1-0 for the majority of
the game, and the ‘Cats generated
several scoring opportunities that
were barely blocked by the Spar-
tan defense. UNCG scored in the
final minutes to seal the victory.

Earlier in the week Davidson
exhibited a more successful team
effort against Coker. The Wildcats
spread the scoring around in a 6-1
win. The game was 2-1 at halftime,

with the Coker goal scored by the
Davidson defense, but the ‘Cats
put the game away in the second
half. Claudia Lombard led the scor-
ing with two goals and Heather
Wineberg found the net on a pen-
alty kick. Sally Graham and Erin
Butcher came off the bench toscore
a goal apiece. Jenny Satterfield
made a.run down the field to de-
flect the ball in for the team’s sixth

~ goal. Courtney Robertson ran the

defense at goalkeeper for most of
the game. The win was a stabilizer
for Davidson in preparation for the
UNCG game.

The rest of the season will be
an uphill battle for the Wildcats (7-
4), as they face a string of tough
Division I opponents. They face
Elon Tuesday at home and travel
to Mercer Thursday. Over Fall
Break, the team will road trip to
Kentucky and Vanderbilt for week-
end games.

coaching career; this win today
was much sweeter.” After the
