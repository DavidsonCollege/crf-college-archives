Taus, Pikas Enter F inals
As IMAC Season

By HOWARD BOYD
Sports Writer

The Taus tand Pikas met
yesterday in ‘the finals of the
softball tournament, while
the Machis ‘and East | re-
mained the last two unbeat-
en teams iin IMAC tennis as
the intnamunall season comes
to a Close.

The Taus sprang upsets
over the SPEs and Sigs while
tthe Pikias whipped ithe Ma-
chis “and Delts, setting up
Thursday's dGhampion-
ship showdown.

The Tiaus railillied for three
runs in the seventh “inning
Mondiay to overcome the
SPEs 4-3.

Reeves Louthan and Ken
Moore rapped back-to-back
‘singles, \jand wafer two outs
and (a walk to Ken Jones,
Jim Roy belted ia ‘two-run
double to tie the score at

We also ‘have ia strong front
four.

“We ‘are going with only
three deep mien because nine
of ithe ‘ten teaimis we willl flace
next season willl be running
the ‘triple option, and we feel
that tan eight mian front is
ithe best way to defense that
type of offense.”

Mosketti thas worked ito
simplify ithe defense this
spring. ‘‘We willl be moving
and ‘slanting on defense in
reaction to tthe ball. It is
important: ito miake the de-
fenise simple enough ‘so that
our defensive men do not
have to think. They will just
react 'to ithe baill.’’

The new coach seemed ex-
tremely ‘pleased with the
progress: his defenisive team
is making. ‘‘I feel that we
have reached ‘the ulltimiate in
what we are trying to do,’’
he staited.

(Mosketti was equally as

optimistic labout 'the Wildcat

telam as ta whole. He siaid
that tthe team’s goal ‘this
year is ‘ito win ‘em. all.”

Mosketti ds) no stranger to
winning teams. He took
Mansfield High School from
a winless season in 1969 ‘to
an undefeated one in 1970.

3-3. Ted Woods followed
with 1a single, driving home
Roy with the winning run.

Tuesday the Taus over-

came an eight-run Sig third
with ‘a balanced attack ito
chalk up ia 13-10 triumph.
Woods homered for the vic-
tors, now 10-3.
‘ The Pikas, 10-2, exploded
for eighteen runs*in the third
to wipe out ian 8-0 deficit
and went .on tto “thump the
Machis 24-17 in ‘the year’s
biggest slugfest.

The next day they ousted
the Delts 8-1 behind sobid
pitching ‘and defense, while
the hitting of George Graff,
Tom Vandiver and Denniis
Watson

sparked, a six-run
second inning. The loss
avenged a  seasomopening

194 loss to the Delts.

The Deilts and Sigs finished
at 10-2 in ia tie for third (sec-
ond iif tthe Taus lost in the
finals), with the SPEs 9-2
and the Machiis 8-3.

In tennis, the Machis, led
by ‘smooth - stroking stylist
John Saunders, defeated the
Betas 2-0, the Sigs 2-1 and
the Delits 2-1 to gain ia berth
in the finals of the winners’
bracket Thursday.

Meanwhile, Bast I, behind
the play of power-hitting Jim
Dorsett, smiashed the Taus,

ing only one match to gain
the other spot.

alive in the double-elimina-
tion tourney. In losers’ briack-
et pllay, Ahe Sigs 3-1, faced
