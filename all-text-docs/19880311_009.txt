The American League East and the definitive picks

By ANTHONY MCCARRON

Which team will seize the op-
portunity and capture the flag this
season in the AL East? Who will
put it all together and walk away
with the divisional crown? What
players will have those “career
years” that will push their club to
the top of the heap? As Mars
Blackmon would ask, “Do you
know, do you know, do you
know?”

Well, Ido. As spring training
gets into full swing, anticipation
mounts. Pinstripers will point to
new-arrival Jack Clark as their
key to the pearly-gates of pennant
heaven. The Jays will laud the
talent of George Bell and a fine
pitching staff. Detroit will ride on
Alan Trammell’s coat-tails.
However, these giants will come
up disappointed. The team that
will represent the AL East in the
playoffs is none other than the
Boston Red Sox.

Don’t you curse me, Yankee
fans, nor you, loyal followers of
the Jays and Tigers, I intend to
convince you of Boston’s superi-
ority. They will repeat their 1986
conquest of the AL East, while
others are left with questions.
What follows is'a preview of all
seven Eastern teams, in order of
finish.

Boston Red Sox :

A surprise, you say? Perhaps.
Donot forget, however, that this is
a team that was only one strike
from witinit? thé 1986 ‘World
Series. The present Sox are better
than that team that lost a heart-
breaker. As pitching has often
been called 90% of the game, it is
necessary to start with the arms of
the 1988 AL East kings.

Roger Clemens. That is all that
needs to be said. Without a spring
training last year, Clemens was 4-
6 on June 12, he proceeded to
finish 20-9 on the year and cap-
tured his second successive Cy
Young Award as the premier
pitcher in his league. And that he
is. He and mate Bruce Hurst form
a deadly one-two punch.

In addition to this pair, the Sox
made what was perhaps the most
significant acquisition of the off-
season in Lee Smith. The burly
reliever solves their bullpen woes
and will help a staff that needs to
fill some holes after the top two.
“The Can” will be back and will

make a more significant impres-
sion than his 1-3, 5.89 mark of last
year did on American League
hitters.

As far as the Boston lineup
goes, they have one problem.
They need to find a place for Jim
Rice to play. He posted some
disappointing stats in 1987, but at
35 he is far from washed up. A
solid, young outfield consisting of
Ellis Burks, Mike Greenwell, and
Todd Benzinger will provide out-
standing punch at the plate as well
as solid defense. Greenwell is a
player to watch. The corners are
set with the incomparable Wade
Boggs (.363) at third and Dwight
Evans at first. Unheralded Marty
Barrett and Spike Owen are at

second and shortstop. Catcherisa .

position to note on the Red Sox.
Rich Gedman will get the nod, and
is backed up by solid youngster
John Marzano. Gedman had a
horrible year in 1987, but was
plagued by injuries and contract
problems. Look fot him to make
a significant impact on the whole
league with his bat, though, in
1988.

It is true thatthe Sox have some
question marks, mainly on the
mound, but they have an outstand-
ing blend of veterans and young-
sters. The youth and exuberance
of Burks and Greenwell fits nicely
with the experience and savvy of
vets such as Rice and Evans.
Gedman will be back strong and
the BoSox will win the race to the
fidg.
Toronto Blue Jays

It is widely believed that this is
the team with the most talent in
baseball. This assessment is very
close to the truth. They have a fine
lineup and a quality pitching staff.
Barfield, Bell, and Moseby form
an impressive outfield, and Tony
Fernandez and Nelson Liriano are
solid at the keystone. In fact, very
little question remains about the
Jays. Key, Flanagan, Clancy,
Cerutti, and Dave Steib make up
an able starting staff, and the bull-
pen is set with intimidator Tom
Henke and set-up man Mark
Eichorn. The Jays have a prob-
lem at third base, where Kelly
Gruber was a disappointment last
year, and a problem with their
mental situation. One part of this
is George Bell. There is spring
training talk of him being rele-
gated to the role of full-time DH.

Bell would rather play the field
and has said so. The Jays need to
find a way to keep the 1987 MVP
happy.

The second part is the fact that
the Jays must be questioning their
ability to win. In 1985, they blew
a 3-1 game lead to the Royals in
the ALCS, in 1987, they dropped
their last seven games to hand the
division title over to Detroit. Can
this team with the most talent win?
This is a question they seem un-
able to answer. .
Milwaukee Brewers

Those fans who were shocked
when the Brew-crew ran off 13
Straight wins to start 1987, felt
justified when they almost imme-
diately collapsed into a 12 game
losing skid. However, this team is
for real. They have top-notch,
young talent. The pitching staff is
anchored by Ted Higuera, Juan
Nieves, and Bill Wegman. Dan
Plesac is the stopper, and the open
spotson the staff could be filled by
the farm. Shortstop Dale S veum is
acontributor, both in the field and
at the plate, and Paul “The Igni-
tor” Molitor is an offensive threat.
Robin Yount seems to get better
with age, as his .312, 103 RBI’s in
1987 indicate. With him, Rob
Deer, and clutch B.J. Surhoff, the
Brewers, though no_ longer
Harvey’s Wallbangers, can still

‘hurt oppondats with their bats.

‘The problem here is inexperi-
ence. If the youngsters don’t
come through, the Brewers have
little to fall back on.

New York Yankees

Yanks fans will be disappointed
to find their beloved Bronx Bomb-
ers as low as fourth. Tough. The
Yanks have the lineup (Hender-
son, Randolph, Mattingly, Jack
Clark, Winfield, and Mike Paglia-
rulo as the top six), but little else.
The pitching is bad. Ron Guidry
will not return to his previous
form, nor will Richard Dotson.
Tommy John is 44 years old and
will not reproduce his 13-6 87
campaign, and various castoffs
will not help. Bright spots include
Rick Rhoden, who injury-free
could win a bundle, and stopper
Dave Righetti, who is one of the
leagues best out of the pen. The
Yanks have baseball’s best player
in Don Mattingly, and one of its’
fleetest of foot in Rickey Hender-

son. These two, as much as the
pitching staff, hold the key to
Yankee contention.
_ For the Yanks to be in the race,
Henderson cannot baby his minor
injuries. He was limited to 95
.games because of an injured
hamstring. Perhaps fiery Billy
Martin can get what is needed
from him. Mattingly must pro-
duce again as well for the Yanks to
bea force. He is the heart of their
lineup and will make the offense
go. .

Too many questions from the
mound, the question of whether
Clark’s injured ankle is healed (he
missed the last month; playoffs,
and series of ’87), and the New
-York spotlight leave the Yanks
behind the frontrunners.

Detroit Ti

Last year’s division champs
have a fine pitching staff, which
will keep them competitive. It
will not, however, keep them in
the race for long. They too are
plagued with questions. Morris,
Walt Terrell, and young reliever
Mike Henneman are quality
pitchers, but Frank Tanana and
Doyle Alexander offer uncer-
tainty. Alexander will not ap-
proach the 9-0, 1.53 ERA per-
formance he turned in for Detroit
at the end of last year, and Tanana
can’t get by on guts and wits for
too much longer.

The pitching is decent, yet the
lineup does not offer much other
than Alan Trammell and the bat of
Matt Nokes. Kirk Gibson is gone,
and the Tigers really have no suit-
able replacement. Darrell Evans
will turn 41 in May and the Tigers
have got to be wondering how
long he can go on producing.

Newly-acquired Gary Pettis is
an offensive zero in center-field,
and it is doubtful that Tom
Brookens, Chet Lemon, and oth-
ers can supply enough O to com-

plement Trammell and Nokes.

Nokes is a hitter playing catcher,
which hurts the Tigers oft-lauded
Strength up the middle. Morris
will enable the Tigers to compete
favorably every fifth day and they
will get some help from clutch
Alan Trammell, but gone are the
days when Willie Hernandez
could come in from the bullpen to
save the day. The Tigers pull in at
number five.

Why not

Cleveland Indians

The popular pick of 1987 turned
into a 101-loss disaster area. The
Indians do have some young tal-
ent. Too bad none of it is on the
mound. The Indians gave up more
runs than anybody in ’87 and it
won’t get any better in ’88.

Their staff is horrible and it is
still in doubt whether they can get
any outs this year. The bats of Joe
Carter, Mel Hall, and Cory Snyder
will have to hit home runs by the
millions in order for the Indians to
win at all. The offense is in good
shape, with Julio Franco, Brook
Jacoby, Pat Tabler, helping Car-
ter, Hall, and Snyder, but the
pitching is so terrible that the
Indians can only dream of a place
higher than sixth.

Baltimore Orioles

This is a team with close to
absolutely nothing going for it.
Cal Ripken and Eddie Murray are
the main attractions of the of-
fense, and they will get some help
from Larry Sheets and Fred Lynn.
After that, management should
start praying. Those fans excited
about the prospect of the brothers
Ripken as the double-play combo
ought to save their energy. Billy
will help afield, but good fielding
second basemen are a dime-a-
dozen at this level. In the minors
Big Bill was touted as a good-
field, no-hit player and so he will
remain in the majors. In all fair-
ness he did bat a cool .308 in 58
games last year but don’t look for
his name among the league lead-
ers this year.

The pitching is, in a word,
awful. The “ace” is Mike Bod-
dicker, who sparkled last year
with a 10-12, 4.18 performance.
After him, there is little worth
mention. The Orioles are in
trouble.

This year you can look for the
Sox, Jays, and Brewers to provide
us with a thrilling pennant race
that will keep our interest long
into September. The Yanks will
providesomecompetitionas well.
The Sox, however, will put it all
together to win it. Rice, Gedman,
Greenwell, Lee Smith will re-
spond with big years to carry the
Sox into the playoffs. Look for
Mattingly and Paul Molitor to
have big seasons to help their
clubs, as well.
