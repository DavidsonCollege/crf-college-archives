Casablanca and The Maltese Fal-
con are timeless film classics, virtually
unsurpassed within their genres for en-
semble acting, snappy dialogue, and
pure entertainment.

Featuring two of the most memora-
ble principle characters and perhaps
the most memorable distinctly Ameri-
can actor, Humphrey Bogart, Casab-
lanca and The Maltese Falcon are
must-see films for any serious
moviegoer or person who simply en-
joys being entertained. Rick Blaine,
owner of Rick’s American Café in
Casablanca, Morocco and Sam Spade,
private eye extraordinaire are tremend-
ous examples of the modern American
hero — tough, honest, and sly on the
outside, but faithful and romantic
under their exteriors. One identifies
with them because they do not betray
their own feelings or ethics.

Rick and Sam consistently follow
their moral and ideological codes,
something modern man strives for, but
usually fails to do. The integrity of

Bogart’s characters place him among
the most respected and revered Ameri-
can actors.

Casablanca is among the most
stirring, eloquent romantic films in
history. Set within the tense surround-
ings of World War II, Casablanca
centers on the past romancegof Rick
and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). Long after

Due to the overwhelming popular
response to last week’s column, BB
has decided to share with! the college
community at large the fruits of our
P.O. box. For those of you who trek
through the mud every morning only to
find “air mail” in your box, go back
and read last week’s abuse section and
find out what it takes to receive bags
and bags of mail. We know that the
rest of you are chomping at the bit to
find out what goodies are in store for
‘us, so let’s start ripping envelopes!

Dear BB:

What’s going on at the Davidso-
nian? We were all supposed to get
abused last week, but our names were
left out. Look, we only act the way we
do so that we can rate a mention in your
column.

Dear All You Fun Guys:

Look, we tried. However, the
editors told us that you guys get
laughed at enough anyway. We’ ve got
to spread the abuse around some, or
everyone else will feel slighted. Sorry.

Dear BB:

Do you know me? A couple of
years ago I was the hairy guy who sat at
the end of the bench and never got to
play. That’s why I carry this: the
American Express Card. With it, I get
all the recognition I deserve. American
Express — don’t buy your term paper
without it.

Is a VW really a car? Somebody
told me it stood for Vinegar & Water.
I’ve got to know.

Dear BB:

Just what in God’s name is going
on around here? First it’s Spencer.
Next it’s the DeSieno dude. Then
comes See-Saw, and now Beatty! Ev-
erybody’s leaving and we want to
know why.

Dear BB:
Was that supposed to be us in last
week’s School Daze cartoon?
; Ester and Will

their brief fling in pre-Vichy France,
they are reunited where everyone eve-
ntually ends up — in Casablanca.

Sly Claude Rains, greasy Peter
Lorre and rotund Sydney Greenstreet
are superb supporting players, but the
film is propelled by the personas of
Bergman and Bogart. They are truly
magic together. This movie is the

My God! Give it a rest, will you?
We're gonna have to start calling you

Okay, guys, that’s it. No more
reading our mail. Keep those letters
pouring in and we’ll do this again
sometime. Tune in again next week
when BB talks about God-knows-what
(or who). Until then, keep your feet on
the sidewalk and your mind in the gut-

source of classic lines like “Here's
looking at you kid,” “Play it Sam” (not
Play it again Sam), “We'll always
have Paris” and “This could be the be-
ginning of a beautiful friendship.”
Greatest of all may be Dooley Wil-
son’s rendition of “As Time Goes By.”
They simply don’t make ’em like this
anymore.

The Maltese Falcon is a landmark
film because of its faithfulness to the
spirit and atmosphere of true private
eye stories. Sam Spade, the creation of
Dashiell Hammett, is the quintessen-
tial hard boiled detective. Bogart com-
bines the right dose of cynicism and
sentimentality to make his character
work.

Noteworthy as John Huston’s di-
rectorial debut, The Maltese Falcon
revolves around the chase to obtain a

black bird. Although the bird is not
alive, the characters willing to kill for
it certainly are. Lorre as Joel Cairo and
Greenstreet as the Fat Man again pro-
vide a colorful backdrop for Bogey’s
classic performance. Elisha Cook, Jr.
is especially convincing as an innocent
eyed hired gun. Dialogue pacing and
viewer involvement in The Falcon are
as crisp and fresh as in Casablanca.

The viewer readily identifies with
Sam Spade’s efforts to uphold the
honor of his partner and expose the
hypocrisy and greed of all men. Come
find out with Bogey what “the stuff
dreams are made of” really is on
Wednesday night.

Dear BB:

We understand that a lot of people
were upset when we wrote those letters
about Bobby Sands, so we'd like to
take this opportunity to clear the air:
Dear D.C.:

Come on! So the joke wasn’t
funny! Don’t you realize the obvious?
We’ re Pikas, for God’s sake! How can
you take any 0: us seriously? Our cre-
dibility gets shot to hell every time that
football comes out! So please, every-
one, just bear with us in the future.
