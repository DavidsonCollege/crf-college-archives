Women's Tennis Begins Title Defense With Wildcat Doubles Classic

By Bruce Balestier

The Davidson women’s tennis
team, the reigning Big South Con-
ference champions, got their sea-
son underway recently with adual-
match loss at Campbell and an
encouraging, though inconsistent,
performance at their own Wildcat
Doubles Classic.

Against Campbell February 8,
the Wildcats encountered a team
witha distictly foreign flavor. The
Camels carried four foreign play-
ers on their roster, despite the loss
of their number one singles player
(who returned to Budapest): In
singles play, wins by Nicole Wilcox
(number 5) and Barbara Grooms
(number 6) brought Davidson into
a 2-2 tie, with number one Cyndi
Hess and number three Tasha Ruth
still on the court. But both Hess
and Ruth lost hard-fought, three-
set matches, and Campbell took a
4-2 lead. Only the team of Wilcox
*, and Jennifer Beahm could manag

a win for the Wildcats in the
doubles, and the Camels earned a
6-3 win. Still, since the loss was
competitive and came at the hands
of a contender for the conference
title, Davidson coach Caroline
Price was not displeased. “I was
very optimistic,” she said. “We
were competitive at every posi-
tion, whereas last year we were not
competitive atone, two and three.”

In the third annual Doubles
Classic, Davidson faced a talented
five-team field. The Wildcats cap-

high point of the tournament for
Davidson came in a 2-2 tie with
James Madison. The ‘Cats’ num-
ber one team of Hess and Kimber-
ley Nance upset the Dukes’ num-
ber one team, which was ranked
number seven in the Northeast
region.

Her team’s performance,
though erratic, left Price enthusi-
astic. Scholarship players now have
been in the program for a year and
ahalf, and Price says the improve-
ment is obvious. “There’s no

doubt,” she said, “that a year and a
half later we’ve reached a new
level of tennis.” According to Price,
this year’s team is special in that it
combines a high skill level and
depth.

But youth (four sophomores
and two freshmen make up the top
six players) and inconsistency,

especially in doubles, concern”

Price. At times thus far, passive
doubles play has hurt the Wildcats.
Said Price, “Anadjustment we need
to ~ake is to really close off the

”

net.

In addition to the Big South
schedule, the schedule contains
matches against Western Carolina,
Furman and Appalachian State of
the Southern Conference and
Louisville and UNCC of the Metro
Conference. A spring break excur-
sion to Hilton Head will include a
match against Georgetown. The
team plays next at home March 3
against Kenyon.

tured their only win of the three-

day tournament witha 3-1 triumph
over a composite team from An-
derson Junior College and Pearce
Junior College. Both Anderson and
Pearce are ranked in the top 10 in
the nation among junior college
teams. In a match Price called “a
disappointment,” the ‘Cats fell 3-1
to Virginia Tech; the team also
suffered 4-0 defeats to Virginia
Commonwealth and Furman. The
