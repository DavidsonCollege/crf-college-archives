A Little Blue Skying

The Union program book recently
developed by C. Shaw Smith is an in-
teresting dream of what he would like
to see in a new Union at Davidson and
for the most part it is a good attempt to
catalogue what might be included in an
ideal union.

Of course no Union at this college will
include all that Smith has outlined.
Money is too precious to Davidson to
pour into a building larger than Cham-
bers or the new library. But we don't
want to build a structure which will
shrink in utility as the college expands.

The program book does include
essentials which we feel are absolutely
necessary to a functional and com-
munal student center. Any Union
should try to accomodate all student
organizations within the confines of the
building. Such centralization will most
probably encourage participation in
these activities and create a spirit of
cooperation among them.

A large Morrison Room which could
accomodate some 800 people is also a
necessity. Not only will it provide a
flexibility of programming, but will
also allow for larger groups to
congregate.

Meeting rooms, TV rooms, a
rathskeller, a student store, game
rooms, a vending area, a movie
theater and listening room are also
necessary to the kind of Union we need
on this campus.

In addition to such necessities,
Smith's plan also includes some highly
desirable areas such as a campus-wide
photography lab, a snack bar, the in-
triguing Think Tank with aquarium
and a conversation pit.

But there are also several items
which appear a bit extravagent and
quite unrealistic tor the Davidson
situation. An arts and crafts shop
would be better placed in a fine arts
center where skilled advisors may
direct the creative energies of David-
son students.

A Senate Chambers for a Senate that
meets only once a week seems also to
be a bit much. A meeting room would
be more versatile and just as func-
tional.

Although a self-service area for
automobiles is an interesting idea. we
doubt that a Union is the place for it.
Similarly we believe the current post
office serves the needs of the students
adequately. As for the dome room, one
is enough at Davidson.

Aside from these specifics, the
program book for a Union raises some
general questions which will need to be
answered in the near future.

First, there involves the question of a
site. Clearly the old library is
inadequate. Not only would the
location be undesirable, but the actual
building itself could not provide the
needed and desired services men-
tioned above. Any administrator or
trustee who tries to put the Union in
that building will do a disservice to the

college no matter how much money it
will save.

An underground structure appears a
little unrealistic. as does the site in the
center of Patterson Court. Con-
sequently we feel the Lingle Manner
site or the laundry site to be two
Satisfying alternatives to build a new
Union. We prefer the latter to the for-
mer because of its proximaty to the
dorms. But the Lingle Manor site
would allow more room for expansion.

A second question involves the cost
of building such a structure. There is
absolutely no way this college can
raise Smith's projected $3 million for a
new Union. Student fees should be
poured into programming, not a new
building. It is unlikely that our alumni
will support such a venture when they
barely support the new library.

In order to get government loans, we
would have to include in the Union
profit making businesses such as a
food service or a student store in order
to pay off the loan.

This raises a third question where we
want to put the food service in the
future. Should we leave it on the court
or put it in the Union? A third alter-
native might be that the whole student
body will want to eat in a cafeteria in
the Union. To answer such a question
the Campus Planning Committee will
have to project what the social pat-
terns will be several years from now.
Such will not be an easy task.

A fourth general question involves
what role this Union building will play
in the life of this college. A building
alone will not provide a good social or
cultural life for students. Program-
ming is essential for a Union to fulfill
its function. While the Campus Plan-
ning Committee is sorting out the
physical aspects of the Union, we
suggest the Union staff use their
creative energies to build a_ better
program.

Davidson is a small school with a
communal tradition. Even with a
projected enrollment of 1500, we
believe this atmosphere will still
prevail. Consequently, Davidson does
not want a Union with expansive lob-
bies reminiscent of large university
unions that look like hospitals. In-
timacy will be the watch word in plan-
ning any Union facility here.

The questions of site, financing, food
service and Union roles however, are
only a few areas which will require in-
vestigation. Clearly the alternatives
mentioned here are not the only ones
available.

But these are just things which the
campus needs to think about. The
Campus Planning Committee has got-
ten a slow start in its deliberations, and
we doubt if it is big enough to handle all
the questions of future planning that
the President has assigned to it. We en-
courage them to do a little ‘blue
skying”’ and we hope they will take a
hard look at the needs of the students
here.

To regular readers of
‘Rolling Stone’ or some other
“youth periodical’ this article
may be superfluous. But I’m
snowbound, and the need to
write it is not superfluous.

1 envisaged a ‘‘Holiday Sam-
pler’’ article reviewing
albums I'd met over the term
break. However, a particular
phenomenon so struck me that

the previous non-article has.

succumbed.

The ostensible review here is
of a debut album by Good God --
roughly a fourth-generation
group out of Philadelphia.
Earlier Philadelphia groups of
this type are a memorial to non-
success: Elizabeth, American
Dream, Edison Electric, and
Sweet Stavin Chain.

Good God might pass that
way, but I think not owing to
three factors: Captain Beefhart
christened the group when they
called his Los Angeles residen-
ce for a name, the music is a
good bit more than listenable,

and they are an example of that
phenomenon I mentioned
earlier.

The music comes from five
men and shows three primary
influences: Frank Zappa, John
McLaughin and Weather
Report. But forget these, for af-
finities send one back to sources
and that's hardly my intention
here.

Good God are thorough
musicians; three having, the by
now ‘‘de rigeur’’, classical
training.

McLaughin’s ‘‘Dragon Song”
receives a rousing treatment
via solos by Gregg Scott on sax
and Zeno Sparkles on guitar.
Zappa's ‘‘King Kong’’ opens
quickly and lightly into a
somewhat gentler electric
piano by Cotton Kent.

This is gradually overtaken
by crying horns, very akin to a
Weather Report treatment.
Zeno's guitar leads back to
piano and alto sax in a nice
melange.

But the four pieces which
distinguish the group's style are
those written by Cotton Kent
and Zeno Sparkles. Zeno's
(Larry Cardarelli’s) pieces are
“Stone the Crows’’ and
Fisheye’’, while Kent con-
tributes ‘‘Galorna Gavorna"’
and ‘‘Zaragonza"’.

“Romeo and Juliet" by
Charles Francois Gounod will
be presented in English Sunday
at 2:30 p.m. and Monday at 8
p.m. in Ovens Auditorium by
the Charlotte Opera
Association. The opera is a con-
densation of the original
Shakespeare, retaining the
most lyric scenes and those

Shakespeare himself borrowed
from at least three earlier
by at least a dozen composers,
Gounod’s 1867 version is con-
sidered the most successful.

Tickets are $6.50, $4.50, $3.50
and $2.

The latter pieces are as
melodious as the titles suggest.
Kent's keyboards carry the
weight, allowing guitar to take
speculative solos. Vocals are
sparse but always harmonious.

*“‘Galorna Gavorna"’ has some
very tasteful piano with wah-
wah passages, reminiscent of
Mike Finnigan's work with the
Jerry Hahn Brotherhood, and
contains an appearance by
Johnny Almond. .

“Zaragoza"’ opens with a
piano rippling into a sax-led
passage which almost puts one
in mind of a 13 day journey on
camel across the Sahara,
replete with mirages and the
post-effects of motion sickness.

Zeno's “Fisheye” is perhaps
the premiere piece on the
album. I'll not say anymore
than that it defines a peculiar
romantic agony and that brings
us to the phenomenon.

From the lyrics of ‘‘Fisheye”
one may grasp what I'm on to:

How many people want to
try me?

Oh I ought to know;

How you do, you floating
by me.

Oh I shouldn't go.

Oh I'm back, back again.

Oh you move through the
deep and dank.

And don't you think I hear
you saying;

It's so, it's so: twice as bad.

I don't know who to thank.

There's nothing for it but

to go.

Oh I'm back, back, back
again.

It's a newly-opened closet.
Gone are the necessarily
shocking antics of an Alice
Cooper (as well as the alluring
brushes in the locker room),
replaced by the studied
shrillness of a David Bowie.

He's on his own now,
produced by David Bowie.
That's right, if our green litmus
can once measure the latency of
the American public, why not
twice? All enterprises finally go
public.

I've strayed from the music.
Good God is tight -- trilling
solos, looming crescendos, and
tension-filled transitions. A
spate of college talk may
dissipate the phenomenon in six
to nine months; the music Is
sure to outlast or grow with it.
