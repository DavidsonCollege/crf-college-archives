Structures for Peace Conference confronts partisanism

Davidson students attend international session

By JAY BARRON

A group of 21 Davidson stu-
dents and faculty were part of
over 1,200 people who attended
the Structures for Peace Convoca-
tion in Washington, D:C. in an
effort to propose measures for
international peace. The sessions,
even attended by several interna-
tional delegates, brought together
activists from many humanitarian
and environmental groups and
various political perspectives in
an attempt to cut through some of
the myths of war and militarism

and to find some common ground.
' “The big news of the day,”
proclaimed William Sloane Cof-
fin, a New York minister and a
SANE/FREEZE activist, “is that
the world must be managed as a
whole, and not just its parts.”

Davidson participants agreed
that the conference as a whole
presented a lot of good informa-
tion. Associate professor of his-
tory Ralph Levering stated that he
enjoyed the “intellectually stimu-
lating” environment of the week-
end.

“I was very pleased when
people discussed specifics, such
as the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and certain environmental
pollution issues. I didn’t like it
when the speakers became rhe-
torical, and I also saw that people
can become -narrow-minded and
self-serving [even with the best
intentions].”

One message which emerged
was that the words ‘ ‘peace. move-
ment,” which conjure “negative
images for many people--i.e. lib-
eralism and the perception of anti-
Americanism that dates from the
Vietnam era--must be redefined
as a non-partisan term. Many
speakers extended the application
of the term to nuclear disarma-
ment, human rights, the environ-
ment crisis and the “war mental-
ity,” stressing that they are not
simply Republican or Democratic
issues, but are global, and should
be confronted by every person on
earth in a unified effort, regard-
less of his or her political opin-
ions.

One of the groups represented

the World Federalists, an organi-
zation which works to strengthen
international structures such as
the United Nations and the World
Court. Vasily S. Safronchuk, a
high-ranking Soviet envoy to the
United Nations, reminded the
conference that U.N. General As-
sembly resolutions are not bind-
ing. Rather they are mere recom-
mendations to which nations of-
ten do not adhere.

The U.N. needs “teeth,” said
Safronchuk.

Terms such as like “global”,
“unified”, and “planethood” were
common at the conference, as
speaker after speaker reasserted
the increasingly vital role that
international organizations will
need to play in order to stave off

It’s disappointing, because a lot of
people are in it for the wrong
reasons. It was too much patting
ourselves on the back.”

Alex Hayden reiterated what
several of the speakers had said:
people must be realistic about
their goals and reduce them to a
workable size.

“If all you’re working on is the
big picture, it’s like beating your
head against a wall. Soon it’s
going to start to hurt, and you’ll
quit. You’ve got to work locally
and recognize the successes, or
people won’t stick with it,” said
Hayden.

_Many student conferees from
all over the country complained
about student apathy on social
issues, environmental concerns,

nuclear _escalation--
both its threats and its
costs--and environ-
mental destruction.
Some of _ the
Davidson participants
returned’ with very
positive feelings.
Service Coordinator
Caroline Craig said
that she “came away
feeling challenged to
find my own way to
build a_ bridge _be-
tween the way the
world is as I see it and
my vision of how it

could be.

Others saw the con-
ference as an eye-

“ opener. Kevin Dunn, a_

senior, stated that the
conference was full of
“self- righteousness.”

“It was like WE.

had all the answers,
and that we have some
sort of mission to edu-
cate,” he said. “It’s as
though we can’t learn

anything from the

young Republicans or
ROTC, which is abso-
lute B.S,” he contin-

* ued.

Clint Massengill
agreed. “I can see why
the peace movement
doesn’t get anywhere.

and militarism. Many felt that
educating fellow students about
the critical need for involvement
is key, and that nurturing under-
standing and involvement is sim-
ply going to be a gradual process.

Sophomore Gilbert Shaw
pointed out that fighting the tradi-
tionally conservative elements on
campus is not the way to involve
more students. “If we are really
going to lead, WE should get
involved with THOSE groups, so
we can discuss issues instead of
fighting over them.”

Freshman John Howell said
that, overall, he was very glad he
wentto Washington. “It was great
to hear Norman Cousins, and
some of the other noted authors
that spoke. Many of the speakers

Kaylor’s book centers on

Paul’s community concept

By SONYA STARNES

Religion professor R. David Kaylor re-
cently published a new book entitled
Paul’ s Covenant Community: Jew & Gen-
tile in Romans in which he proposes that
“the fundamental conviction underlying all
of Paul’s theological expression is that in
Christ God is acting to bring all human-
kind, Gentile and Jew, into one community
of the new covenant.”

This interpretation carries a number of
implications: it directs future study away
from the concept of individual sin and
salvation and towards that of the individ-
ual’s, place in the community of faith, it
puts forth Paul’s repeated use of the phrase
“no distinction” as the key to understand-
ing his letter, and it views the bringing
together of Jew and Gentile by God as
fundamental to Paul’s understanding of
“God’s saving event.”

Kaylor said that the class “Paul and the
Human Situation,” which he has taught for
the past 24 years, has been a very influen-
tial factor in the writing of his book. His
interest in Paul’s letter can be traced even
further; however--to a seminar he took
while doing graduate work at Duke Univer-
Sity.

Kaylor is currently researching the po-
litical aspect of Jesus’ life in relation to

On the other hand, John agreed
with those who felt that “peace
had been portrayed at the confer-
ence as a partisan issue, which it’s
not.”

Possibly the most poignant cri-
tique of the conference came from
an anonymous typist, who distrib-
uted a statement on the last day of
the conference which he or she
entitled A Message of Concern
about the Peace Movement. It
said: “The common pitch is
simple. Like it or not, and more
than ever before, we are all in the
same boat. The boat is becoming
more crowded, the weather is
changing faster, and unless we
can quickly learn to care, commu-
nicate and cooperate with each
other, we may not reach
our home port.”

In spite of all the hon-
est information and great
intentions, the Structures
for Peace Convocation
reflected how far the
peace movement must
still advance. Conferees
spoke of the invisible
forces and attitudes that
still hinder the search for
justice, human_ rights,
environment _ responsi-
bility and nuclear sanity
worldwide.

anew album and say, “What d’ ya
think of this great new song?” I
don’t ‘want to hear, “Um, It’s
very... interesting.” Flat-out tell
me that it stinks if you think so. If
you don’t want to hurt my feel-
ings, lié to me--albums aren’ t life-
threatening. Just please don’t in-
sult my intelligence by saying one
thing and meaning another.
When I losea game of chess, do
not say, “Gee, you’re such a good
sport.” I know I’m not a good
sport. I smile and act naturally
because society frowns on people
who turn over game boards and
throw knights and pawns against
the wall. I either have to let you in
on my little secret or thank you for

an embarrassing and inaccurate
compliment.

And what about deciding on
which movie to see? I. turn to
Entertainment in the newspaper,
my friend and I narrow it down to
Rain Man or Twins and then she
says, “Either one is fine with me.”
I dread that phrase. I always know
it’s coming and it means that I will
be responsible for the movie if it
tums outto bea flop. _

But my all-time hated phrase is
one that is meant to look like a slip
of the tongue, but I’m convinced
it’s intentional. Whether it’s a
friend’s kitchen, a care package
or an Easter basket, someone
always says, “Hey! Do you want
some... oh, I forgot you’re diet-
ing.”
