WEDNESDAY & THE WEEKEND

WEDNESDAY NIGHT=--
First Come, First Served

The Weekly Wednesday Interlude will
take place in various points of the Union
tonight at 9:00 p. m. THE CUISINE WILL
INCLUDE CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICHES, POTATOE
CHIPS, AND COKES. For the gourmet the
famous David Ovens College Union Roquefort
Sauce will be prepared for your potatoe
chips and taste buds.

By special arrangement PING PONG
AND BILLIARDS WILL BE FREE DURING THE.
BREAK. Socializing will include bridge,
shuffle board, and dancing. Girls have
been invited.

All commodities on a first come,
first served basis. Consequently, be
at the Union at nine sharp for some
unionized fun and food,

FRIDAY=~
Not such a Good Friday: Science Exams

FRIDAY & SATURDAY NIGHT—
"Tap Roots", Susan Hayward, Technicolor

TAP ROOTS is almost super-colossal
from any angles it's from the best-
selling novel by the late James Street;
the almost late Susan Hayward is adequate
from any angles the symbolism of the tap
roots; the technicolored picture of Antee
Bellum Dixie,

We might even suggest that TAP ROOTS
da a poor man's GONE WITH THE WIND, but
that phrase was used (and plagiarized by
the Union sign maker) last week by this
writer, and we can't be (come) trite,

TAP ROOTS is worth both your time
and your money, but leave the latter
behind, for it's FREE both Friday and
Saturday nights at 9:00 p. m.

SUNDAY--
"S' Raised to the Seventh Power

With exams for many this
following Wednesday, you may find
yourself on the hill this Sunday.
In case such an event should occur
you might heed the helpful hints
