Grapplers Faced
With Bleak Year

“Bleak—teal bleak” is what Coach Charles Parker
thinks of the prospects of the upcoming wrestling sea-
son, which opens Wednesday at Furman.

“It's not that we aren't good
enough,’ Coach Parker said.
“The boys we have are good
wrestlers, but we just do not
have enough. Right now we
don't have anyone in the 137, 145
and 152 pound weight classes,
and that’s going to be hard to
compensate for.”

As it looks right now, Joe
Buffington will open in the 123-
pound class, followed by Martin
Miller at 130 pounds. Both are
returning lettermen. Following
the three undecided classes will
be sophomore Ronnie Hunt at
160, and letterman Terry O’Hair
in the 167-pound class, Captain
Eric Nichols returns at 177, and
sophomore Lowell Bryan holds
heavyweight.

The big problem remains,
though, to come up with some
one to fill each of the other three
classes. ‘‘As it stands now,’
we'll be giving away. 15 points in
match in those three mid

Due to the big gap in his pres-
ent lineup, Coach Parker stated,
“We'll take anybody we can
get in those three weight classes.
Otherwise, we'll have to expect
to get beat. We can't spot any
one 15 points and hope to beat

had 16 rebounds.

Coach Terry Holland said of
the game, ‘We played poorly in
the first half but did real well
in the second period. I felt that
we could have gotten to them
sooner, but I was pleased with
the outcome. I was particularly
pleased with the second unit.
They played great for the small
amount of time they were in
there.”

The Deaclets were sparked by
Ed Montgomery and Jim Hay
nes, who scored 18 and 12
points, respectively.

Turning to individual play and
prospects for the season, the
Wildkittens are sparked by
Dave Moser and Wayne Huckle.
O'Neill, Crosswhite, Mike Dick
ens and Mike Spann also add
strength.

Moser, hampered by an in

ball well and scored eight points

that he is a good defensive play-

this year.

all have good potential and with
a little experience could mature

SEEK TO REBOUND AT HOME

’Cats To Host Three Foes

Davidson's Wildcats, who tip
ped-off their 1965-66 campaign
with a 87-86 loss to Wake Forest
two nights ago, will face three
“unknown” foes in the com
ing week. Coach Lefty Driesell
will be sending his legions into
frays with Bucknell, Furman,
ind Marquette.

While the Paladins are an old
conference opponent, Bucknell
and Marquette are new on the
‘Cat slate. According to Dries
ell, “At this time we know very
little about any of these teams,
other than what we have read
Our coaches will scout them,
and we will look at films, but
right now, we are not sure which
boys they will play against us.”

The successful Wildcat  piiot
emphasized the fact that Buck
nell would be an unknown quan
tity: “We can't evaluate them,
since it will be their first game
We are trying to talk to other
coaches in their area now.”

Last year’s. Bisons registered
11-13 mark, best in
seasons, and hope to raise that
record this year. They will ex
hibit a tough defense, one that
was tenth nationally last year.

an recent

A trio of 6-6 hoopsters, Matt
McMonigle, John Rodgers and
Frank Weirman, will support
two year starter Larry Kozella.

Furman comes to the David
son campus December 7 seeking

to improve last season's dismal
record. But despite occupying
the Southern Conference cellar,
the Paladins forced the ‘Cats
to the limit in one encounter be-
fore losing. Driesell commented,

“This will be a vital game, as |

it is our first conference test.

“We know that Dan Goolsby
and Bane Sarrett are tough
boys, while this Webster kid
played well against our fresh-
men last year.”’

“This kid" is 6-6 Don Webster,
who hit 27.2 as a freshman.
Goolsby tallied 17 a game for the
varsity.

Marquette’s Warriors will in-
vade Charlotte Coliseum Thurs-
day. Their main threat is 6-5

IMAC Basketball

The annual IMAC basketball
season tips off tonight at 7:00
p.m. as the Phi Delts meet the
Phi Gams and the Pikas go
against the Pi Kapps.

Although the basketball race
was scheduled to begin yester-
day, a last minute practice by
the freshmen roundballers
caused the postponement of
the Beta-ATO, game and the
Kappa Sig-KA contest,

The Kappa Sigs should be un-
beatable this year. Stu Burness
is back, and the addition of
varsity quitter Scott Sinnock will
make the Sigs a good match
for some of the teams on the
‘Cats schedule this year.

As for also-rans, there should
be a host of them. The ATO’s
loom as pre-season runners-up
choice. They will be closely fol-
lowed by the Sigma Chis and
possibly the Delts.

Generally, not counting the

battle for first, which is no bat-
tle at all, the league is bal-
anced. Second place is shaping
up to possibly a big fight.

Unless the Fraternity Evalua-
tion Committee changes their
ruling on freshmen eligibility, no
new faces will dot the fraternity
scene, and any chances of up-
sets or dark horses are there-
fore somewhat lessened.

Under the present rule fresh-
men, even pledges second se-
mester, will not be able to play
with their fraternities and must
play with their dorm teams if
they plan to participate in intra-
murals.

Handball is also beginning, to
the interest of practically no one.
Another long, boring season is
forecast. As to a favorite, the
SAE’s could have the inside
track, although the SPE’s and
Delts generally field strong
