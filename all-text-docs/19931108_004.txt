Workshops on interviewing skills may help students get jobs

By Scott Windham

To help students prepare ad-
equately for the round of job inter-
views which begins in late fall and
continues well into the spring, the
Office of Career Services offers a
series of programs designed to hone
students’ interview skills.

With the help of area profes-
sionals and Davidson faculty and
staff, Director Carol Jordan has

created a set of interviewing work-
shops, where students gather to
learn the finer points of successful
interviewing.

Among the “insider tips”
might be how to dress to look the
part of the job you are trying to
obtain, how to use positive body
language and avoid negative body
language, oreven what sort of pens
and paper to pane: Local business

Every tree on campus has an attached scientific label.

Campus is an arboretum

The vision of Davidson’s cam-
pus as an arboretum dates back to
1869 when the Board of Trustees
received a proposal from the fac-
ulty “to make the Campus in its
contents represent in time the for-
est growth of the State, and, if
possible, the general botany of the
region.”

After many years of hard work
and cooperation, the Physical Plant
and the Biology Department, who
together hope to “develop, main-
tain and display a major collection
of woody plants that will thrive in
the Piedmont of North Carolina,”
have achieved and even surpassed
these goals with the development
of the Davidson Arboretum.

Interest in the idea of the cam-
pus as an arboretum was renewed
in 1982 when the Director of the
National Arboretum in Washing-
ton D.C., Mr. Henry M. Cathey,
urged President Samuel R. Spen-
cer, Jr. touse the campus’ grounds
as a working arboretum. A subse-
quent $10,000 donation from the
estate of Mr. Edwin Latimer Dou-
glas, whose first loves were for-
estry and Davidson College, made
it possible to convert Davidson’s
collection of various trees and
shrubs into an official arboretum
by cataloging and labeling each
plant.

Good record keeping is one of
the important distinguishing char-

acteristics of an arboretum. The

arboretum’s caretakers, Superin-
tendent of Grounds Mr. Brawley
and the Physical Plant, were able
to improve their record keeping
methods in 1985 when a $5,000
donation from Martin Marietta Ag-
gregates funded an aerial survey.
These aerial photographs were used
to make topographical maps and to
identify over 1,650 major trees.
Today, the Physical Plant has
over 2,000 plants identified and
located on a grid map. Most of
these plants are labeled with metal
tags which indicate the plant’s fam-

ily name, scientific name, com-
mon name, location on the grid
map, assigned accession number,
hardiness zone, and native area.
Allofthis information is now stored
on a database computer which
makes it more readily accessible.

The number of trees has in-
creased from 1650 to 2000 during

the ten years since the initiation of
the project in 1982 due to a policy
which replaces each lost tree with
three new ones. Over 250 trees

ewere lost during Hurricane Hugo
in 1990 but they have all since
been replaced. The replacement of
trees is funded by the general Physi-
cal Plant budget. The arboretum
does have asmall budget ofitsown
which is used to buy labels and
cover other small costs.

The development of the arbo-
retum is an ongoing process in
which the Physical Plant and work
Study students are continually in-
volved. Their most recent project
has been the landscaping of the
Visual Arts Center. All of the
plants on the grounds of the center
have been assigned numbers and
are now being kept track of.

Mr. Brawley believes that
members of the community do take
advantage of the-arboretum.

Elementary and secondary
school teachers bring science
classes to the arboretum for field
trips.

Junior and senior high school
students make use of the arbore-
tum when collecting leaves for
projects.

Local garden clubs and other
organizations participate in guided
tours conducted by the Office of
College Relations several times a
year.

Mr. Brawley is pleased that
Davidson’s campus has “begun to
attract visitors for the sole purpose
of visiting the arboretum,” and
believes that the arboretum will
continue to provide positive pub-
licity for the college as well as a
beautiful sight for all those who
visit the campus.

professionals such as Mr. Bob
Wilson, Director of College Re-
cruiting at McGladrey & Pullen,
bring theirown unique viewpoints
to the workshops, adding a “real-
world” perspective to the sessions.

Each workshop is held on-
campus in the late afternoon or
evening, and lasts around one hour.

In response to requests from
past seniorclasses, Career Services
is also instituting a series of video-
taped mock interviews. Sign-up is
at the Office of Career Services on
Main Street. Students who partici-
pate will have the opportunity to
interview with a faculty or staff
volunteer in a realistic but “no-
risk” situation.

Anumber of different formats
will be offered, including mock
business, graduate school, and non-
profit type interviews. Recording
the sessions on videotape will al-
low the student and the interviewer
to define areas of strength and sug-
gest areas of improvement. This
idea is not new; according to vol-
unteer interviewer Dr. Leland Park,
ODK offered this same service a
number of years ago.

To supplement mock inter-
views and interview workshops,
Jordan emphasizes the importance
of informational interviews. Rela-
tively simple to arrange through
Davidson alumni and other con-
tacts, informational interviews al-
low students to do a “trial run,”
developing interview skills in a

“These interviews compel stu-

_ dents to research the company they

are interviewing with, and to de-
velop strong resumes and refer-
ences,” tasks necessary in a “real”
interview situation, Jordan adds.
Many seniors who have al-
ready begun interviews have no-
ticed the interview facilities at the
Office of Career Services. The
offices in the Julia Johnston House
include a spacious interviewers’
lounge, where many recruiters opt
to conduct interviews, and two
smaller, private interview rooms.
According to staff, these rooms are

a great improvement over past fa-
cilities and lend an air of profes-
sionalism to interviews, as well as
being comfortable enough to re-
duce first-time interview jitters.
Careers Library director Ann
Melton recommends that, in addi-
tion tointerview seminars, students

.browse through the large selection

of books. These resources include
101 Great Answers to the Tough-
est Interview Questions, and Mar-
tin Yate’s Knock ‘Em Dead with
GreatAnswers to ToughInterview
Questions. Reading space is pro-
vided in the library 8:30 to 5:00.

Arumoris spreading around
campus, which, if it proves to be
true, will catse numerous
Davidson women to swoon.

The ticket office will neither
confirm nor deny whether An-
drew Shue, star of “Melrose
Place,” has purchased tickets for
the NCAA Final Four, to be held
in Davidson on December 3 and
oI

Shue, who portrays Billy on
Fox-TV’s “Melrose Place,” is an
avid soccer fan who played for
Dartmouth’s varsity team during
his college days.

Lee Sargent, Manager for
Special Projects at Davidson says,

“What I’m suggesting is that most

Will Melrose's Andrew
Shue show for Final Four?

of the [celebrities] who come to
this type of thing will have some-
one call for them and put the tick-
ets under someone else’s name.”

He adds: “Also, people like
that will often ask us not to di-
vulge the information. Then, they
will call us a week or so before the
event, andask us to prepare for the
appropriate security measures.”

Sargent did admit that there
would be some notable sports fig-
ures in attendance for the Final
Four.

As for whether or not Shue
will visit the Davidson campus for
the tournament, Davidson females
will have to wait and see.
