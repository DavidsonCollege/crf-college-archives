SI's Jeopardizing, Journalistic Jinx

A few weeks ago Davidson basketball looked like
it was at an all-time high. The whole starting team was
coming back. It was a team which had done well last
season, and which looked like it would do even better
this year.

The front of the Davidson basketball folder for
this year proclaims “Number Eight in ’68; We'll Be
Fine in 69.” But all of this happened before the fatal
blow struck .. . before the web of uncontrollable fate
snared the Davidson team.

It happened just over
a week ago... when
Sports Mlustrated pin-
pointed Davidson Col-
lege for destruction and
announced that Mike
Maloy would be on the
cover of the college
basketball edition.

Now Coach Lefty
Driesell and the Wild-
cats will have to work
on a new defense. The
old one simply will not
do. At least this time
he is aware of the for-
midable foe and can
perhaps take steps to
escape the impending
doom.

it indeed sounds ab-
surd that something as
small and as flimsy as
a magazine could gener-
ate such a destructive
force, but numerous examples froth the past increase
the credibility of the idea.

Take 1964 for example. Most Davidson students
remember the fateful encounter with the menacing
magazine that year, but the story is worth repeating.

It was the annual basketball issue that year that
first attacked Davidson. It was in that issue that the
SI people picked Davidson as the number one team in
the nation.

It was that night that Davidson lost to St. Joseph’s
in Philadelphia’s Palestra, 77-64.

It was the next day that copies of Sports Illustrated
on the Davidson campus disappeared into waste cans,
fireplaces and oblivion.

What remained, besides the ashes of SI, was bitter
memory, a few harsh words and a unified request that
SI leave us alone the next year.

Sports Itlustrated kills with kindness. It did it in
1964 by using every favorable adjective it could find to
describe Davidson and its Wildcats.

The article noted how Driesell had removed the
Davidson tradition of the moral victory (quoting him
on, “A moral victory is like kissing your sister”), and
called the 1964 Wildcats the “fastest, fairest band of
educated ruffians around.”

Driesell came out with another quote the next
day, after the fall at the hands of the St. Jo squad. He
said Davidson lost because it -was “out-shot, out-re-
bounded, out-hustled and out-everythinged.” But the
fans knew better. They knew that Hetzel, Snyder,
Teague, Davidson and Marcon did not lose to the
Hawks. They saw it immediately as a case of the SI kiss
of death.

Fortunately, the antidote was found quickly, and
Davidson rebounded in its next game with a 113-82
humiliation of Furman, with Hetzel flipping in 53
points.

Davidson escaped the jinx after the initial shock
fairly well that year. Other teams have not done as
well. Hanratty and Seymour were never quite the
same after the SI feature on Notre Dame, and the
1964-65 Florida team lost two big ones immediately
after the Sports Illustrated story on the team’s poten-
tial. Last year, SI talked about Niagara’s slow start
and how the Calvin Murphians should have done well
for the remainder of the season. They didn’t.

So when it was announced that Maloy was going
to grace the cover of this year’s basketball issue, there
arose a unified groan from all segments of the David-
son campus. There was talk of the jinx. There was
mention of all of the evil things which might happen
to Maloy the day after the issue reaches the newstands.
And then there was a second thought.

Also on the cover will be Charlie Scott (you re-
member Charlie), of Carolina and talented. Mike Casey
of Kentucky. The article tied to the cover supposedly
will deal with the rising basketball prominence in the
South. The New York-based magazine apparently is
launching its own assault on the rise of the new South.
It is such a shame that they have to ruin such great
potential.

At least this year, Davidson doesn’t play St. Jo
on the night the b-ball issue comes out. But the Wild-
cats do play Vanderbilt during the same week, and
Vandy, being tough, can win with the help of SI.

Lefty would be wise to take precautions. He could
ask SI to print only two-thirds of its cover that week.
He could ask the Davidson Court of Appeals to issue
a restraining order against the printing of the maga-
zine. And if these fail, at least he could ask all of the
stores (“all of the’ sounds better than “the three’’) in
town to keep that issue of SI off the stands.

Somehow the jinx must be averted. And the jinx
seems to be coming unless some action is: taken. SI
can’t pick us as number one this year. But destroy our
season by generosity in column inches they can.

So pray. Cross your fingers. Find a four-leaf clover
(they can be found at full moon in front of Dana
Science Building). Do anything possible for good luck.
The jinx must be averted at all cost.

We made the mistake of impressing SI this year.
Maybe next year we can keep the team’s greatness
hush-hush. After all, ignorance is bliss . . . especially
if SI does the ignoring.

Due to this week's snow.
Davidson's soccer team goes
into today’s game against
North Carolina State with
one less game's experience
and one less starting player.

The. game with. Appalach-.

ian Tuesday was canceled,
but the two teams will play
here next year instead of at
Boone. ,

A much more serious prob
lem is the loss of junior wing
Roger Peterson. During the
Monday _—inight ~— snowfall,
Peterson slipped on the icy
grillwork in front of Belk.
He was taken to a hospital
with a badly-gashed right
leg, which took over 50 stit-
ches to sewback together.

Peterson started at right
wing for the ‘Cats and, ac-
cording to coach Harry Fog-
leman, made over a dozen
assists by crossing the ball in
front of the net, thereby al-
lowing the insides and for-
wards to score. He is credit-
ed with almost half the
team's assists. :

Fogleman was undecided
on who would start in place
of Peterson. He said either
freshman Brian Tarr or jun-
ior Randy Carter would pro-
bably fill the gap.

The team meets State a
week after its last game with
Emory, which ended in a
impressive 2-2 tie. In that
contest Davidson played one
of its best games of the
year, dominating play throu-
ghout most of the game.
Carter and Cam McNair
scored for the ‘Cats.

Davidson's record going
into today’s game is 4.5 2.

the meet and that wiped out
any Davidson chance to top
ple: the Spiders.

Whittle termed the meet a
“fine race on a very good
course." George Davis. of
ECU took first place with a
record time of .25:52.4. im
proving the former mark by
33.6 seconds.

Leading the way for the
Wildcats was freshman Chris
Sikes who ran “a beautiul
race’ according to Whittle.
Randy Phillips, senior cap-
tain of the team, took second.
while Roger Clark ran his
best race of the year for
third.

The team continued to
show improvement in the
final meet of the season. The
times at the five mile mark
of the 5.3 mile course were
the fastest of the year for
the Wildcats.

Commenting on the 4-7
record amassed by the team,
Whittle said the team was
not as strong as it had been
in the past: He corifidently
predicted a better season
next year with the return of
last year's top runner. John
Puckett. who is spending his
junior year abroad.

He also pointed to the ex-
perience gained by the under.
classmen this year and the
performance of Stagg New
man, Newman led the team
in most*’of the meets this year
and “improved much more
than we had expected.’ Whit-
tle said.

Led by tough defensive end
Bruce Johnson, the Wofford
line averages 6.2, 205 pounds.
Wildcat assistant coach Bob

gave minor -college power

is ‘fone of the best Davidson

potent offense into the game,
led by senior Ted Phelps
and junior Larry Forgacs.
