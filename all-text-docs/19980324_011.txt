THE DAVIDSONIAN

Press RELEASE
Van Every/Smith Galleries

Anexhibition of eleven sculptures
and two collotypes by Elizabeth
Newman opened at the Van Every/
Smith Galleries at Davidson College on
Mar. 19. The exhibition ‘“Recollec-

tions/Reconstructions,” curated by
Perry Nesbitt, Director, contains anum-
ber of pieces origi-
nally created in re-

sponse to specific
architectural
spaces, along with
pieces con-
structed in
Newman’ s studio.
Newman’s work
often relates to is-
sues of healing,
nurture and care-
giving. Inthe neu-
tral gallery space,
“the stark site is
transformed and
becomes in a
sense, a metaphor
for the mind, both
psychological and
emotional,” ac-
cording to
Newman. “The
memory materializes.” An undeniable
aid to this memory is Newman’s use of
such elemental and associative materi-
als as talcum powder, beeswax, honey
and milk. The olfactory senses sur-
round us, and we are drawn into a re-
flective state.

Elizabeth Newman will show
slides of her work on Thursday, Mar.
19, at 7 p.m. in the Visual Arts Center
auditorium. A reception will follow in
the atrium until 9 p.m. The exhibition
will remain on view through Apr. 26,
excluding Apr. 9 to 14, when it will be
closed for the Easter and Passover holi-
days. A brochure with an essay by
Eleanor Heartney is available from the

Van Every/Smith Galleries.

For Newman, architectural space
possesses a powerful inherent memory
based on its cultural and social history.
Informed by site and studio, her sculp-
tures are also transformed by their con-

text and the alterations and recombina-

tion of materials that she uses.
An 18th Century family home, the
Middleton-Pikney house in Charleston,

@ Elizabeth Newman at the Visual Arts Center

S.C., was the location of an early
Newman piece titled, “Honey in the
Rock (Got to Feed God Children).” It
celebrated the nurturing role of the Black
“dah,” or nursemaid in affluent white
households and was one in a series of
site-specific installations, “Places with
a Past,” held in conjunction with the
1991 Spoleto Festival U.S.A.
Newman also participated in a
similarly site-influenced installation in
1992, “Art at the Armory: Occupied
Territory,” commissioned by the Mu-
seum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.
It preceded the Armory’s demolition to
make way for the Museum’s new struc-
ture. Her piece, “Histories of Human

‘Recollections/Reconstructions” arrive at the VAC

Flesh,” responded to the building’s cold

. and impersonal status as the final home

for many young soldiers, the last of
whom were serving in the Gulf War.
Ideas of nurture, care-giving, and
healing come up repeatedly in the work
of Elizabeth Newman. Many of the

‘objects she employs resonate with as-

sociations from past lives. Held and
loved and needed by others, they are
reborn in
Newman’s hands.
Just as inanimate
objects can some-
times trigger
sense-memories,

, Newman creates
environments that
recall strong emo-
tional and physi-
cal experiences —
memories of
events both per-
sonal and global.
The hu-

-man connection
through touch,
Newman _be-
lieves, can pro-
vide a vehicle for
the transference
of energy or spirit.

It is this energy
that has the power to renew or heal. The

Bill Giduz

- empathic reach beyond the self to con-

nect with another is what invests us
with humanity. Newman reminds us of
the importance of these selfless acts.
Elizabeth Newman lives in Con-
necticut and hasa studio in Port Chester,
N.Y. She grew up in a close mid-
western family, along the shores of Lake
Michigan. She received an MFA from
the School of Art Institute of Chicago in
1984, and a BFA from Michigan State
University in 1978. In 1974-75 she
studied at the LudwigMaximillians
Universitat in Munich, and received
Illinois Arts Council Fellowship/Grants

“Primary Colors” entertains, disturbs

By WILSON BuUNTIN
Guest Writer

“Primary Colors,” based on the
best selling novel by Joe Klein, is based
heavily on Bill Clinton’s 1992 run for
the presidency. The only thing that is
different is the names. Instead of the

_ Clintons, it is the Stantons who are
slumming their way to the White House.
The movie is filled with A-list starts

joyed the movie.

Although it had moments of light-
hearted humor, “Primary Colors’’ is
truly, on a deeper level, a disturbing
film. Stanton’s slimy ways really hit
home on a personal, human level in the
film. Should we have to settle for such
a slimeball even if he may have some
good ideas? “Primary Colors” asks this
and many other difficult questions about
our political system. It is worth watch-

Health Advisors wanted
Inquire within

By Eric BorGsTROM

This week, we are writing to en-
courage our fellow students to apply
for one of the four Health Advisor
positions. Applications will be avail-
able in the next few weeks, and the
new Health Advisors will be meeting
together by the end of the semester.

This year was the first year for
the Health Advisor positions, so there
is still a large amount of flexibility in
the. job. As for duties, we are respon-
sible for freshman orientation, por-
tions of PE 101, hall programming,
and various other activities, usually
pertaining to the different health aware-
ness weeks.

Much of our work is behind the
scenes, helping out with health-ori-

Student Health Advisor

ented activities like National Smoke-
Out Day, Depression Awareness Day,
and Alcohol Awareness Week. Most
of all, our jobs are a lot of fun, and we
get to hang out with the sex lady,
Georgia Ringle.

Our most memorable experience
was probably the FLAG Fashion Show,
where we got to look like fools and
support tolerance and health aware-
ness all at the same time.

If you are interested at all, please
contact the Student Health Center,
Georgia Ringle, or one of the Health
Advisors. We welcome any questions
you have about the Health Advisor
positions and encourage everyone to

apply.
