The annual SGA Phonathon
was held in Chambers Gallery on
April 6-10.

Volunteer student callers so-
licited alumni, parents, and friends
of the College to raise support for
Davidson’s annual operating bud-
get to the tune of $63,326.

Funds raised help pay for stu-
dent scholarship aid, furniture for
the dorms, athletic equipment, elec-
tric bills, faculty compensation, and
more.

The Phonathon is structured to
create competition among the
houses of Patterson Court and inde-
pendents.

Besides the satisfaction of help-
ing maintain the excellent quality
ofa Davidson education, the houses
that raise the most money and gen-
erate the most participation receive
cash prizes.

Members of Kappa Sig showed
a lot of house and school spirit this
year, as 42 members volunteered to
make calls.

In respect to the size of their
houses, SAE and Fiji also showed a
lot of support with 18 and 14 mem-
bers participating.

Warner Hall raised the most

money this year: $6845. Sig Ep:

was second with $4995, and Rusk
was aclose third with $4980, Over-
all, callers raised $63,326 towards
the maintenance of the College.
“Many thanks to all the house
chairs for a job well done. Their
hard work paid off and is evident in
our results,” says Mary Tucker,
Assistant Director of the Annual
Fund. :
SGA President and Junior Class
Phonathon Chair Buster Burk says,
“I think the Phonathon rocked the
nation. It was well organized, but I
wish there was more participation.
Overall, I think it went well.”
Phonathon chairs had a great
time and were pleased with student
effort, but they encourage more stu-

dent support in the future, as the
turn out was not as great as it previ-
ously has been.

Former SGA President and
Senior Class Chair Warren Buford
has been involved with the
Phonathon for several years.

“I thought the Phonathon went
well this year. I was really encour-
aged by the people who did come,
but I hope that students will do
more in the future, because it’s
something that’s really important
to Davidson. It was lots of fun, and
I was happy to be involved in it.”

Lucia Plosser, Senior Class,

Phonathon Chair agrees.

She says, “In the beginning we
were a little nervous because not
that many people were showing up.
It was right after Spring Frolics, and
it probably wasn’t the best timing,
but the people who were there did a
great job. It was all a lot of fun.”

Foster Haselden, Freshman
Class President and Phonathon
Chair was excited about his first
Phonathon experience.

“Thad a really good time at the
Phonathon. The more people that
showed up, the more fun it was.
The first night I had a blast with
Rusk, Kappa Sig, and Fiji because
there were so many people there
and everybody was into it. Coach
Fagg was at his peak. It was just a
good time, but I had fun the whole
time,” he says.

The Annual Fund staff was
pleased with the students’ partici-
pation and dedication.

“The S. G. A. Phonathon re-
mains at the heart of our Annual
Fund effort every year. lam always
impressed by the dedication the
Davidson students make to our cause
to raise $3.8 million,” says Lanier
Brown ‘82, director of the Annual
Fund.

Associate Director Carolyn
Sherrill Fuller ‘92 says, “The stu-
dents make the Phonathon! Their
excitement and enthusiasm is con-
tagious and reaffirms why we do
the kind of work we do.”

On Saturday, a
memorial was dedicated to the
159 Davidson students and
alumni who gave their lives
during World War II.

The Classes of 1944,
1945, 1946, and 1947 conceived
and funded the granite
monument.

Due to mandatory
ROTC membership on
campus, Davidson men joined
the Navy and Air Force as well
as the infantry. Many went
directly into the infantry as
second lieutenants, who
suffered the highest attrition
rate in the war.

“That war had such an
impact on this school. Before

of all the names of the men
who died during World War
II. 159 is an awful lot of
people,” says Director of
Reunion Giving Brian Tarr.
The stone was cut and
polished by the James Burnette
Quarry in Elberton, Georgia.

Mill will soon bustle, but will
students be part of the crowd?

By Mary Care JALONICK
Editor Emerita

The old Davidson Mill on
Watson Street has long stood di-
lapidated and unoccupied.

Come September, however, -it
will become anew center of activity
in Davidson.

The new development will be
called
“Davidson
Village,”
and will
include
offices,
condo-
mini-
ums, re-
tail
stores,
and a
restaurant.

Construction will begin this
summer, and residents are sched-
uled to move in this September.

“It’s about 70% rented,” says
realtor Jim Ridle, who is in charge
of the project. So far, the Cotton
Mill is scheduled to house a furni-
ture store, art gallery, and medical
Offices. °

Ridle is currently negotiating
with a group that wants to turn one
part of the Mill into a brewery.

Even if that does not work out,
he says, there will definitely be a
restaurant.

“The old tin building that used
to be a staging area for cotton will
be moved to sit along the tracks,” he
“We are trying to save the
interior look.” The inside of this
building, though filled with trash, is
constructed with high ceilings and
open beaming.

The apartment/condos, de-
scribed in the Mill’s promotional
materials as “newly constructed vil-
las that will be home to a fortunate
few,” are clearly targeted at the fi-
nancially stable — they begin
around $130,000.

Ridle says he
expects most oc-
cupants to be re-
tirees who wantto
move into the
area. ;

A press re-
lease says that in
the condos,
named the Linden
Court Villas,
“floor to ceiling

terior, gracefully

combining mod-
ern amenities with the ageless
beauty of yesteryear, will be adapted
to the. individual requirements of
each tenant. Configuration and size
of every area will harmonize per-
fectly with the mood of the space.”

Ridle sees the area as an
extention of downtown Davidson.

Developers will construct a
brick walkway from Griffith Street
to serve as a continuation of Main
Street.

The Town of Davidson will
pave the dirt road behind the Mill-
(the road separates the Mill and
Career Services, Financial Aid, and
Admissions buildings).

The wooded area along that
road will be made into a parking lot.

“Davidson is promoting itself
as a safe place,” he says, “where
you don’t have to get in your car and
drive. We want it to be like the old
days, where everyone knew their
neighbors.”

Neighbors of the Davidson
Mill, however, are mostly older
Davidson residents who will not
necessarily match the buyer profile
of the Linden Court Villas.

Ridle says that developers are
trying to change that.

“All of the houses in this area
are becoming very valuable,” he
says.

“When any of them goes on

sale, developers are snatching them
up. The problem with Davidson is
there is no place [to develop]. If
you went into downtown and tore
down:a building, then God would
strike you down.”

When asked if there are any
businesses other than the brewery
that students would frequent, Ridle
seems unsure.

The building still has units to
sell, but so far most units are offices
or specialty stores.

“All of the developers are
Davidson residents,” he says. “We
are trying to make this as much of a
mixed-use [area] as possible.”
