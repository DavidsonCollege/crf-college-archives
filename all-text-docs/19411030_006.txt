Davidson had several forward pass

Says Many Students Deferred
From the Draft

On Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday of last week, Mr.
Hengeveld met with the fresh-
men in groups of about eighty
during chapel hour.

His purpose in talking to
the freshmen was to present a
few of the problems which they
face, During his talk Mr.
Hengeveld brought out four
main points,

First—He attempted to ex-
plain the purpose of the coun-
seling system) and what he
hoped it would mean to the
students.

Regulations

Second-—He gave a thorough
explanation of a few faculty
regulations which each year
seem to confuse freshmen.
One of the regulations which
was stressed was the cutting
of classes,

Third—Mr,. Hengeveld ad-
vised freshmen to be very
careful in selecting, the sub-
jects which they “take. He
stressed the fact that students
going into graduate schools
should be especially careful.

Fourth The last point
which was brought out was
about the Selective Service
Act and its relation to college
students.
