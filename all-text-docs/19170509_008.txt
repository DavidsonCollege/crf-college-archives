REV. C. F. MYERS
GIVES INSPIRING ADDRESS

Last ‘Thursday evening Rev. Charles
F. Myers, pastor of the First Church,
of Greensboro, spoke to the Y. M. C. A.
on the subject of “Remaking Marred
Men.’ He took his text from the 18th
chapter of Jeremiah, verses 3 and 4:
“Then I went down to the potter's
house, and, behold, he was making a
work on the wheels. And when the
-vessel that he made of the clay was
marred in the hands of the potter, he
made it again another vessel, as seemed
gead to the potter to make it.”

Aaron Burr gave up God, and for a
while he mounted rapidly the steps of
fame. He aspired to set up a republic
of his own, but the plot was discovered,
and he was convicted of treason. He
died a few years later on the Continent,
a shunned, despised man. Why? He
was a marred man, because he had given
up God, marred by the world, the flesh
and the devil. All sins cripple. One is
never the same man afterward, tho the
change is very gradual, and does not
come in a day. The human soul does
not realize the change, and compromises
here, and makes concessions there, and
hefore it knows it, winter sweeps down
on it, the awful winter of sin and de-
spair. All souls, tho slightly soiled, are
greatly reduced in value. But he made
it again another vessel, as seemed good
to the potter to make it. God can make
us mew vessels, but never the same one
as before. Let us go back to the source
of all being to keep us pure and as un-
marred as possible.

STUDENTS AND ALUMNI.

I am grateful for the college for your
past assistance and crave it in increased
measure for the future.

We found this year that 10 per cent
of the student body came to Davidson
principally because of the influence of a
current student. That is fine. And is
it not splendid that 42 per cent said they
came because of the influence of an
alumnus? Money cannot buy such an
asset and the college would not sell the
loyalty of its sons for any sum. Now
the war is on and we must all make
sacrifices. Davidson did it in the Civil
War, and she is sending a large number
of her young sons out into this war. We
shall lose a number from the upper
classes, fellows of the age our country is
calling to her defense, and they are go-
ing willingly. As I write this article 1
am constantly stopping to tell one and
another good-bye. God bless them and
keep them. I well know. they will be
true soldiers and do their duty as Dav-
idson men habitually do.

But this means we must have more
new men to fill the ranks—good men,
too—for we are giving our best to our
country. We need your help, student:
and alumni. Seek out good, well pre-
pared young men and sce that they reg-
ister for next fall. We will help you ir
any way we can, you may be sure. Wh:
shall it not be said that considerabl:
more than 10 per cent come next fall be-
cause of the influence of current  stu-
dents? Make it 20 per cent, fellows!
And let the Alumni, young and old, in-
crease their per cent at least to 60 per
cent.

We are facing the uncertainties of the
future unafraid. God has blessed the
college and will take care of it, and we
depend upon the loyalty of the sons of
Davidson without a moment of hesita-
tion. The ‘college will open as usual in
the fall with all professors on hand and
the work will go on with its accustomed
efficiency. So no prospective student need
hesitate to enrolled and to do so
promptly.
