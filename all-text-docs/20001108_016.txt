Imagine representing your country in an
athletic event in front of an international
audience. Imagine walking into Olympic
Stadium in Sydney in front of 120,000 cheer-
ing fans from across the globe. Imagine
walking through Sydney with fans clamoring
for your autograph because you just won
multiple medals.

For Davidson’s Kendra Berner, those seem-
ingly unrealistic dreams became reality. This
past month she represented the United States
of America as a swimmer on the national
Paralympic team and held her own winning
four silver medals.

The Paralympics are held about a month
after the Olympics in the same city. There-
fore, Sydney was in the spotlight yet again.

Berner was
born with a
congenital de-
formation of

ming she uses

fied to com-
pete in 7 events at the Championships.

The Paralympics are broken down into 10
different physical disability levels, with an
S1 being the most disabled and an S10 being
the least disabled. Berner qualified to com-
pete in the S10 classification of.the games.

Berner commented that other swimmers in
her classification “had partial hand amputa-
tions, and one had a leg that was four inches
shorter than her other leg.”

After the trials in'June, Berner headed to
Colorado Springs for the US Paralympic train-
ing camp in July. While there she was able to
meet several of her teammates, and she re-
calls, “I kept in touch and became friends

with one girl, who was from my home state of
Illinois.”

Then, in October, it was off to Sydney,
where Berner competed in 5 individual events
and 2 relays. .

During the first week in Sydney, Berner
remembered, “We were in training and wel-
come events all day.”’ She continued, “the
Paralympics is huge in Australia. Overall,
not many Americans have heard of the
Paralympic Games, and, actually, I did not
know much about the opportunity until [went
to the trials in June. However, fans were
everywhere in Australia. The Australian
Paralympians are big superstars, like national
heroes in some cases, and the Australians
really follow the games.”

When asked if Sydney hosted the

Paralympics as well as they had the Olym-
pics, Berner responded with an emphatic
“yes.”
_ “Adver-
_ tisements
| were all
- over bill-
boards,
! magazines,
and televi-
| sion for the
| games, and
| the Austra-
| lian people
_ were so
| friendly
| and sup-
- portive of
the ath-
 letes.”

Berner
continued,
— “So many
people
wanted au-’
. tographs,
and with as
much secu-
rity as there
was for the
athletes,
we really
felt impor-
: tant.”

After the week of training, the competition
began. Berner recalled, “Swimming lasted
the entire length of the Paralympics, so every
day we had preliminaries in the morning and
finals in the evenings.”

Basically, there wasn’t much free time for
Berner to site-see around the city. She com-
mented that she was able to tour some during
the final two days that she was in Australia
but the majority of her time was taken up by
swimming.

Berner commented that the overall excite-
ment, enthusiasm, and thrills surrounding the
games really didn’t sink in until she was
about to swim in her first race. “In my first

event, the 200 IM, everything really hit me
when I stepped up to get ready for the race
and the announcer said, ‘In lane

States of America, Kendra ©
Berner.’ Ihadonly beennervous |
about swimming a couple times
previously, but I have to admit I 7
felt the pressure.” pe

She finished fifth in the 200 7
IM, and then went right back out ©
for her second event, the 400
freestyle, and won a silver medal
with a time of 4:48.96.

Berner won her second silver
medal in the 100 freestyle with a
time of 1:02.78. She finished
only about a second behind the
gold medallist, who set a world
record in the event.

Bernercommented, “The meet
was really fast overall. The pool was fast to

swim in, and lots of world records were set

everyday.”

In her third individual event, the 100 Back-
stroke, Berner finished fifth, while a team-
mate set a world record in the event.

Berner won her third individual silver medal
on the final day of competition in the 50
freestyle, finishing with a time of 28.83 sec-
onds, which was only .39 seconds behind the
gold medallist who set a new world record.

Berner’s fourth silver medal came in the
400 Freestyle Relay.

“Overall, the American team swam well.
Lots of records were set and lots of medals
were won by our team.”

Berner then commented that the overall
atmosphere of the swimming events was “‘ab-
solutely amazing.”

“The swimming stadium held 17,500
people, and it was full every day. The people
were so loud and into the events, it made the
experience so incredible. Usually when we
swim in the United States, like at Davidson,
there are handfuls of fans in the crowd; how-
ever, at the games, the fanfare was amazing.”

The Paralympics were broadcast on na-
tional television throughout Australia, and
Berner remarked about how amazing it was
to turn on the TV and see herself swimming.
“Some of my teammates starting telling ev-
eryone there that I was on TV about to swim.
It was really cool watching myself swim, and
then having the close-up of me after finishing
second for the silver.”

Aside from the actual athletic competition,
Berner remarked about how amazing it was
to witness some of the paralympians partici-
pate in their events. “There was a wide range
of disabilities there, from having only one
arm to not having either leg. However, the
people don’t think of themselves as disabled.
They have amazing motivation, and they
don’t see themselves as having any physical
disadvantage.”

Even though Berner’s Paralympic experi-

ence is over, the celebrity status surrounding
her success and the American’s success is not
over yet. After

“Tcan’t wait to
go, it should bea

mented Berner.

Wrapping up
her Paralympic
experience,
Berner recalleda
particularly memorable moment.

“T’ll never forget the opening ceremonies,
marching in the arena with 120,000 people. I
was so amazed not only by the athletes, but
also the people. After winning one of my
silver medals, I rode the bus back to the hotel
with the coach and only acouple other people.
When I got off, there were people there with
sparklers and taking pictures of me. The
people truly.made the event a memorable
experience.”
