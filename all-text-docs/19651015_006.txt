Independents Again To Attempt
To Organize An Eating Club

Believing that an eating club
can be successful and attractive
at Davidson, a group of campus
Independents plan to attempt
again to start one here.

In this group are Andy Little.
Jesse Sims, George Brown, Joe
Obenshain, Bob Powell, Tommy
Ashford and others.

The college agreed last April
to build one or two houses for
eating clubs if there was the
demand for them. During the
last month of school last year,
many of these same students
tried and failed to get one estab-
lished. .

“We couldn't get enough peo-
ple to commit themselves for
the college to go ahead and build
a house,"' Obenshain explained.
*‘We had to have about 50 peo-
ple. and we didn’t have thai
many.’’

Twenty-three students agreed

to the Trustees.

Members of the committee are
Dr. J. McDowell Richards, presi-
dent of the board: D. R. LaF ar
Jr.. vice-president of the board:
and Dr. Thomas G. Thurston.
who represent the Trustees; and
Dr. J. G. Martin and Dr. -W.
G. Workman of the faculty.

“While there was thorough
discussion concerning proposed
amendments to the motion of
the joint committee, the faculty
endorsed the proposals of the
committee as amended." Martin
remarked. “The faculty discuss-
ed the proposals at length be.
fore adopting the regulations
which they considered to be best
for the college.” he continued.

The amendment also explicit-
ly permits the storing of alco-
holic beverages in the locked
trunks of student automobiles.
The ‘‘trunk rule’? was omitted
from the faculty regulations due
to a technicality arising from an
amendment to the student body
Grinking rule this spring.

Rules concerning possession
and consumption within the town

limits do not apply to a stu- °
dent while in the home of his —

immediate family. This portion
of the new rule directly affects
20 students—16 married students
who live in the town of David-
son and four whose families re-
side within the town limits.
_“The students owe a vote of
appreciation to the faculty for.
this indication of confidence in
the students’ maturity and sense
of responsibility.” remarked
Student Body President Bill
Council to THE DAVIDSONIAN.
“I am_ confident,’ Council
added, ‘‘that the students will
continue to be aware of their
duty to conduct themselves in a
manner deserving the faculty's
confidence and befitting a mem-

ber of the Davidson College:

Last year’s attempt failed be-
cause, according to Obenshain,
“We were so rushed. We didn’t
have time to be specific. and
people didn't want to commit
themselves to anything as gen-
eral as what we présented.
That's one fault we're going to
correct here.”

troversy were very emphatic in.
noting on their questionnaires
improvement in students’ work
and response during the first
week of classes.

There has not been, however,
any evaluation of the delayed
rush system as a whole.

Presently, the committee is in-
volved in trying to collect as
much pertinent information as
possible about social life at Dav-
idson so that they will be able
to make what Abbott terms
“valid. thorough and just de-
cisions’ about any further
changes in the fraternity situa-
tion.

Abbott also mentioned that
the questionnaire to be given to
the fraternities is further de-
signed to help the fraternities
decide on their objectives at a

time when they are rushing and
thinking about the type of men

they want to pledge.

Other members of the com-
mittee, which meets on the sec-
ond _and _fourth Monday eac
month, are Dr. S. D. Maloney,
Professor Hansford M. Epes, the
Rev. Will Terry, Paul Simpson,
Tom Earnhardt, John Burks and
George Kuykendall.

“We want to see if we can
ge* enough people interested this
year.” he stated, These Indepen-
dents planned to meet Wednes-
day night with Dr. McCormac
“to decide what kind of a course
to take.” ,

One of the questions facing
them is whether or not to estab-
lish a plan to present to the
freshmen when rush starts on
October 30.

“We may possibly jump into
rush at that time, or we may
wait until we get a more sub-
stantial program and organiza-
tion set up." Obenshain remark-
ed. .

“But we want the freshmen
to know.’ he particularly em-
phasized, “that there will be an
alternative to fraternities if
some of them find the fraterni-
ties aren't exactly what they
want.”

Whether or not these Indepen-
dents decide to offer something
to the freshmen during rush,
Obenshain pointed out, they are
starting much earlier than they
did last year, and will have a
more concrete plan to offer
the students this time. He espe-
cially mentioned that a constitu-
tion and basic prograrn might
be drawn up.

“We have a good group to
work with. We might have an
open meeting sometime next
week,’ he continued, “‘particu-
larly for those who did sign up
last year.”

As far as he knew, Obenshain
said. the college wouldn't have
to reapprove its plans concern-
ing the houses. ‘‘Anytime in the
future when we can get enough
people to commit themselves,
the college will go ahead and
build these houses. The college

Dr.
wood, editor of Punch and
Reynolds Lecturer, spoke in
chapel Tuesday on the his-
tory of his magazine and on
the differences between
British and American hu-
mor. ,

During the coffee hour which
followed in the Union, Hollo-
wood answered questions on po-

i‘ Htieal and social problems in
Great Britain.

According to Hollowood, Eng
lish humor is ‘family’’ humor.
which is the ‘‘best in the world.”,
Because England's population of.
53 million is crowded into an
area Jess than twice that of
North Carolina, with no great
differences in race or climate,
the British have a uniform sense
of humor, ’

Added to this is the fact that
the English have a, truly
‘national’ press in which any
single newspaper can be found
throughout the country. Be-
cause of all this, he explained,
humor plays a large part in
English life. Tt can be found in
almost every column of a
British newspaper.

“Even in the House of Com-
mons,"’ said Hollowood, ‘‘a
speech that. failed to produce

laughter would be considered a}:

failure.”
In concluding his chapel talk.
he advised all aspiring cartoon-

some other field at first. in or-
der to gain experiences that will
later provide material to draw
or write about. ‘

of the IFC Transportation Com-
mittee.

The fourth recommendation,
about a delegation from the IFC
attending a freshman Council
meeting, was fulfilled by the
presence of Jim Terry and two
other IFC representatives at the
meeting. Terry explained sev-
eral specific rush regulations,
particularly those concerning
rush parties.

For Homecoming the five
freshmen dormitory teams will
compete against each other in
the construction of projects. Ex-
penses for each project may not
exceed $25.

Other business included the
announcement that the election
of the president of the Fresh-
man Council would be held at

: the next meeting. Two fresh-

man representatives to the cam-
‘pus Social Council will also be
elected at that time.

Freshman Court Takes
Lenient Stand Thus Far

The Freshman Cou:t has
taken on a newly inactive role
this year in enforcing the not-
so-regulatory Freshman Regula-
tions.

According to Dave Powell,
frezhman advisor and chairman
of the court, “‘Almest every-
body seems to be satisfied with

{
iabk ‘

the way things have been go-
ing.”

Powell disclosed that the
Freshman Court has not met
once this year. But then he
added. ‘‘No reports of violations
have been turned in to me.”

Powell then pointed out that
the nature of the Freshman Reg-

ulations has been changed from
the compulsory nature of pre-
vious years to a more volun-
tary one:

For example, last year's rule
which stated that ‘freshmen
must speak respectfully to
everyone they meet on campus,”
has become this year’s advice,
“A friendly and respectful greet-
ing by freshmen to everyone

' they meet on campus is a habit

which continues Davidson's at-
mosphere of amiability.”

Probably the most obvious
change in the regulations is that
freshmen are now required to
wear their beanies only at ath-
letic events, rather than at just
any place out-of-doors.

The policy on name tags is
the same as ever, but many of
the ‘69ers seem reluctant to com-
ply with the last noticeable rem-
nant of the old regulaions.
(Freshmen are still required to
take a test on the Honor Code,
college yells, etc).

“Frankly, I haven't the desire

_ to enforce any of these rules

through the Freshman Court,"’
said Powell, “but I may have
to do so if people don’t start
wearing their name tags.”

Commenting on the effect of
this year’s regulations in build-
ing class spirit, Powell remark-
ed, “The freshman class has
shown more spirit than any that
I have seen in my experience
here.”

The inauguration of a sugges-
tion box, the filling of open posi-
tions on campus committees and
the backing of the retirement
of Fred Hetzel’s jersey high-
lighted the Student Council
meeting Monday night.

The Student Opinions Commit-
tee, under the auspices of the
Student Council, will install a
suggestion box in the College
Union for the purpose of poll-
taking on various issues.

“We hope that any students
with pertinent suggestions will
feel free to use it,” said Paul
Marion, chairman of the com-
mittee.

Polls will be taken on such
things as the spending of the
$25.000 Student Activities Fee,
Vesper and chapel regulations,
a free cut system, the parking
problem, fraternities. the- drink-
ing issue and other matters of
general student concern.

‘“‘We hope that the students
will take it seriously as it is a
good way to bring action to the
problem and get a general idea
of thoughts on the subject. by
the ‘students,"’ Marion stated.

Tom Rhodes attended the
meeting to report on the possi-
bility of opening the gym on a
regular basis. He announced
that the gym. will be open next
week on some kind of schedule
if it can be worked out with
Coach Lefty Driesell. He asked
that everyone check the bulletin
to find out when the gym will
be open.

Open positions on four of the
campus committees were filled
as the Council voted on the
nominees who had expressed in-

asked about the present political
situation in England. he stated
his belief that Prime Minister
Wilson will be defeated in the
next general election.

In his opinion, this will lead to
the birth of a new political party,
formed by Liberals, ex-Laborites
and some left-wing members of
the Conservative Party.

In response to a question on
Viet: Nam. he said that the ma-
jority of the English people are
in favor of their government's
support of the American position
there.

that the United States is trying
to impose a government on the
Vietnamese that is ‘too advanc-
ed" for them.

After a question on the effects
of the decline of the. British Em-
pire since World War II, Hollo-
wood stated that many Bmglish-
men feel ‘degraded’ by the loss.
but that he personally wads both
pleased and stimulated by it. He
agreed, however, that the Eng-

unfair burden on America in

making faculty committees.

Bill Council next asked for
coments on the question of re-
tiring Fred Hetzel’s number 44
from the basketball team. The
athletic department contends
that there is a shortage of num-
bers, but most students feel
that Hetzel’'s accomplishments

merit the retiring of his jersey

Council was all in favor of action
that would prevent the use of
the number this year.

Dave Powell suggested the dis-
