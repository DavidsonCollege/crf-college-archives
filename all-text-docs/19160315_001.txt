Morrow Brothers Quartet Renders
Good Entertainment.

One of the best Lyceum attractions
given at Davidson this year was render-
ed last night by the Morrow Brothers
Quartet. This quartet is composed of
four brothers, each possessing a rich, har-
monious voice, and the selections render-
ed showed ability and skill. The vocal
music consisted of ensemble singing and
solos, while very good - instrumental
music was also given by the quartet.

Possibly the part most enjoved was the
excellent readings and character imper-
sonations. Many times the audience was
moved to laughter by the clever cos-
tumes and excellent impersonations of
Mr. FE. M. Morrow.

The whole program was well ar-
ranged and rendered in fine style, caus-
ng everyone to enjoy the evening.

Their Values Discussed.

Saturday night Dr. J. DeR. Hamil-
ton, Professor of History at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, gave a lecture
on International Relations, in) Shearer
Hall. Dr.: Hamilton is working in the
interests of the American Association of
International Conciliatian, and his pres-
ence here was secured by the recently or-
ganized International Polity Club.

Dr. Hamilton stressed the fact that
the world’s answer to the question, peace
or war, is more freighted with possibili-
ties today than ever before. “Phen he
discussed’ the arguments of those who
believe war is inevitable and those who
believe it can and will) be abolished.
From the teaching of history he showed
the fallacy of the war myth. “No good
thing has ever been brought out by wai
which could not have been better secured
by peaceful action.
“Men must be
brought to realize that there is a higher
patriotism than the lust of the primitive
savage for blood.” He then outlined the
fundamental idea of the lately establish:
ed peace unions. Although they are only
a beginning and still grope in the dark.
they tend toward one ideal. “Vhis pro-
vides for the use of force against ane
member of the union that goes to war
without giving a chance for arbitration.
“Education has made the individual set
the his disputes in the courts, and educit
tion alone will make the nations pursue
the same course.”

Dr. Hamilton closed by stating his be
lief that it rests on the Caited States to
lead the world “through law to justice,
through justice to peace.”

After the lecture the locat Polity Club
gathered’ at the home of Professor Cur-
rie for discussion of club affairs and to
inect Dr. Hamilton. :
