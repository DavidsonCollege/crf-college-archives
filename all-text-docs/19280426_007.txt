The above young ladies are: Misses Lib Simpson, Ann Fayssoux Johnston Winnie Pegram, Lib “Anderson, Martha Erdman. These five are the girls who are the most in demand for Davideon
houseparties. This fact was ascertained by a thorough search made through Davidsonians, fraternity registers, and memory books to disclose which of the hundreds: of fair guests of the last four years
were most sought after. Doubtless the sources for discovering the most frequent visitors were inadequate, but from the material available the five girls, out of approximately one thousand, who have at-
tended the greatest number of Davidson house parties in the last four years are those above, Each of these have about a dozen bide to their credit, which when one takes into consideration the very wide
field from which selection may be made is a remarkably large number. Runners up in the contest, who might possibly have been winners had complete records been available, were Misses Char-

lotte Guy, Jean Craig, Craigie Pegram, Piggie Newell, and lIeabelle Pharr. ew
