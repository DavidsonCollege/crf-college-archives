Scholarship Grants Offer
Aid For Grad Students

By BILL LINEAWEAVER
Staff Writer

Each year millions of dol-
lars in scholarship funds are
made available to eligible
graduate students, but ac-
ademic achievement is only
one requirement: others are
persistance, knowing where
and when to apply. and luck.

About.70 percent of David-
son graduates go into grad-
uate or professional work of
some kind. Since most of the
grants given are in the form
of departmental aid from a
graduate school, a student
seeking a grant for advanc-
ed study should work closely

with a professor of the de-
partment containing the area
in which the student plans
to do graduate work.

The professor would be
most familiar with the nec-
essary information.

Many sizeable grants in
nntional fellowship competi-
tions, however. require in-
stitutional nomination of the
applicant by his college. At
Davidson, nominations are
made. by the Faculty Com-
mittee on Graduate Scholar-
ships, whose membership in-
cludes Professors George L.
Abernethy (chairman). R. D.
Bernard. Joe C. Embry.

STEP Expands Tutoring,

Stresses Creative Work

By REID SAMPSON
Staff Writer

Changes and innovations
are in line as Project STEP,
the Student Tutorial Educa-
tion Program, begins its third
year of tutoring culturally
deprived children
Davidson and Cornelius com-
munities.

Robert-Pyeatt, chairman of

Debaters Take
Four Out Of Six

The debate team. coached
by Ray McMillin, finished the
six-round University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill
tournament with a 4.2 record
last weekend. _

Fletcher Hartsell and Gray
Mason defeated Furman.
Richmond. North Carolina
and Hampton Institute while
losing to Emory and South
Carolina.

The topic was “Resolved:
That the executive control of
U. S. foreign policy should be
significantly curtailed.”

MeMillin said that the
team ‘“‘is in better shape
than ever."’ McMillin attri-
buted the improvement to the
fact that the team returned
to Davidson a week before
school started to work eight
hours a day on researching
the debate topic.

“Lack of background in.
formation and evidence has
been a weak point for us in

FABULOUS DINING

the past,” McMillin said.
**We have lots of talent this
year and are taking on the
toughest tournaments we can
find.’’ .

This week-end Davidson
will send Jim Cooley, Mason,
Hartsell and Jule Young to
Auburn to battle with several
other schools in an eight-
round tournament.

The most important tour-
nament for the team. this
year will be the one held at
Emory in the early part of
November. A good showing
here would bring in moré
invitations than the team
could handle, said McMillan.

The plans of the team in-
clude a novice tournament at
»>Wake Forrest, the sponsor-
ing of a high school tourney
at Davidson over the Thanks-
giving Holidays and matchs
with Alabama, Dartmouth,
Georgia, Miami, N. Y. U. and
Tulane.

the STEP committee, said
that there would be new
programs in addition to the
tutorial program. He said
STEP will sponser a student-
faculty seminar entitled
“Perspectives on Proverty”’
headed by Stagg Newman,
and possibly an after-school
study center and seminar
program for high school stud-
ents.

A daily recreational pro-
gram at the local school like
one presently run by Charlie
Baker in the Cornelius com-
munity will be instituted if
there is sufficient student
participation.

Randy Phillips, head of the
tutorial phase of STEP, men.
tioned changes that will pro-
mote a more tightly organiz-
ed tutorial program. “The
problem last year was that
the organization didn't give
support to tutors once they
began:

“This year there will be
two group sessions for new
tutors where they will be
introduced to tutoring tech-

niques and given manuals
and background reading. Re-
sults of our program were
impossible to determine in
the past, but this year we
will conduct comprehensive
evaluations of each student.
“More emphasis will be
placed on creative work this
year and less on academic
techniques,’ Phillips said.

A core of 15 tutors return
this year and additions will
be made from among 38
applicants. Tutors work with
the children on an individual
basis and devote an aver-
age of four hours a week.-
“Tutees” are selected from
the third through — sixth
grades by elementary teach-
ers for participation in the
program.

STEP is not geared for
thorough academic tutoring
but instead emphasizes the
personal relationship between
tutor and child. The express-
ed goal of the tutorial pro-
gram is to “improve the
tutee’s self image and de-
velop in him a better attitude
toward school.’
