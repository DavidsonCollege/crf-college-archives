- In Memorium
I used to call my girl “My Own.”
What'd you quit for? .
She thought I was horsin’ her.

Sam—Some people are born great,
others have greatness thrust——

Bo—And some people grate on my
nerves. Shut up!

Correct As Usual
Tom—You have a wonderful knowl-
edge of the English language. What are
three most popular words ?
Thumb—I don't know! ’
Tom—l've never known you to fail!

Placing the Blame

Teacher—Johnny, you know you didn't
write this composition. It is too replete
with errors. I must notify your mother
of your carelessness.

Johhny—I didn’t write it!

Teacher—Then who did.

Johnny—Maw.

Sportsman—Will they put me in jail
if I catch fish in this lake?

Guide—No, sir, they'll make you mayor
of the town, There ain’t no fish in the
pond,

If your man has gone and left you,
Don’t think that love is blind;

He may be gone in person, but
He'll have the presence of mind.

Cromwell—The cylinders of that car
j remind me of a command I learned to-
day.

Fenton—What’s that?
| Cromwell—Fire at random,

Another Essay
A tadpole’s a funny fish most likely. |
When he shakes his tale he wiggles and |
| when he wiggles he swims and when he}
| swims he shakes his self most vigorously. |
| When he gets water in his mouth he!
don’t drown because he ain’t that kind of |
a fish. Most generally he likes water|
anyway. He just swims all in it. Some- |
times he changes to frogs and when he|
does that ends his tail.

Little Boy—Gimmie a penny’s worth of
candy. :

Storekeeper—Can’t you make
nickle’s worth?

Little Boy—No, sir, my dad’s a college
professor.

A Tonic
No, Gwinevere, corn whiskey isn’t a
patent remedy for/ business.

Fire Water
Jack and Jill went up the hill
To get a bottle of water,
The revenug officers caught them—
Now, wasn’t that awful, daughter!

Pat—Shucks, no, IT ain’t ever been to
college. I got my polislivin a mop fac-
tory.

Ish you drunk?

I don't shink you did!

Strange! Sounds like T have, but may-

In Turkey, Mr. Skeyhill asked the young
with which he came in contact,
; Whether they were going to continue their
fighting, They replied that they did not |
want to fight any more but simply wanted
to be left in peace. The Turks have been |
fighting continuously for 12 years and now |
they have signed the treaty of peace. }

In Italy, the speaker saw the mobilizing of
the Fascisti forces for the overthrow of the}

revolution and have obtained peace.

The speaker found the same desire for
peace preventing a confligt between the Ger-
mans and the French in the Ruhr quarrel. |
The soldiers of both France: and Germany
are tired of war and will not let their re- |
spective governments draw them into another
fight. “In Britain the situation is the same,”
said Mr. Skeyhill,

Hand, he also believes that he was overthrown |
by the English people simply because he held |
to the idea of war too long. The English are |
tired of war, ;

Besides this desire for the young
men of Europe he found, want a religious
They are tired of the ritualism and
the formality of the religion which they have.
One young man referred to their present
religion as “theological theatricals.” In
intelligent group of university students, the
speaker heard a bright Hungarian say, “The
Htrouble with our churches in Hurope is that,

if Jesus Christ returned to earth, Ele would
not qualify as a member of the church.’ The
young men of. Europe want a simplified,
rationalistic religion, They want the church
to go back to the true religion as it was
given by Jesus Christ, ;

The third thought in the minds of the

young men of Europe is the establishment
of a system of cugenies. “Kugenies,” said
Mr, Skeyhill, “is not something: to theorize
about and not practice.”

[ply the rule of God for improving and puri-
fying the human race morally, spiritually, in-
jtellectually and physically.” He found that
this thought was uppermost in the minds of
ithinking young men wherever he conversed
| with them, In the universities: of Oxford
jand the Sorbonne he found it was the sub-
| ject upon which the students were thinking
| seriously.

things in the world. It is broadening of the

fis spiritual! How can this system of eu-
genics be applied? The people of.the world
|must first be educated to the value of eu-
genics, Then laws can be passed to carry
;out the rules of cugenics. The law requiring
ja clean bill of health before marriage is the
first one to enact. This would do away with
{many evils of our social life.”
