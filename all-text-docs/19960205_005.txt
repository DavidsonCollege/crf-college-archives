Students call for better darkroom facilities

By ANN HATFIELD
Staff Writer

Davidson’s Visual Arts Cen-
ter was designed with an unfin-
ished darkroom, Now, two years
after the building’s completion, still
no darkroom exists.

Davidson students have ex-
pressed concern that this other-
wise comprehensive and progres-
sive art center houses no photogra-
phy facilities.

Herb Jackson, Chairman of
the Art Department, explains that
completing the darkroom and en-
dowing a new professorship to
oversee a photography program
would cost in excess of $1 million.
He does, however, call it a future
goal of the college.

“If enough students demon-
strate interest in photography and
a darkroom, a more desirable loca-
tion might be the new student
Union,” says Jackson. A dark-
room in the Union could be used
for extracurricular as well as aca-

demic purposes; and thus would
not mandate hiring a new profes-
sor.

Seniors Brooke McCrae and
Rob Kosicki, two student photog-
raphers, applaud this plan.

“There is definitely interest in
photography on campus but the
facilities are so bad that they deter

students from cultivating talent,”

says McCrae. “The darkroom in
the basement of the Union is in-
fested with bugs, allows light to
infiltrate, has severe plumbing
problems, and houses chemicals
that have been there since the mid-
80s.”

The present facility is used
almost exclusively by the newspa-

New user- friendly system will give

erades by phone beginning this summer
Registrar’s Office offers prize to students who name it 3

Davidson can now join the
ranks of bigger, more efficient
schools. Students can now stop
running to the mailbox over Christ-
mas and summer breaks.

The Registrar’s Office re-
cently purchased a new telephone
voice response product through a
grant from the Mellon Foundation,
allowing students to call in and

receive grades and do schedule
adjustments by computer.

“What we want to do is be
more efficient and eliminate long
lines in the gallery for schedule
adjustments,” says Registrar Polly
Griffin.

The current option for tele-
phone schedule adjustments has
helped reduce these lines dramati-
cally, but the new system will al-
low more people to call at one time
and communicate their needs

through a computerized response
system.

“It’s very user-friendly,” she
adds, It will be available in the
spring for students to call in and
receive their grades.

Griffin is offering a prize of
$50 to the student or group of stu-
dents who name the new voice
response system.Those wanting to
submit a name can turn in their
responses to the registrar’s office
before March 1.

they are the only groups with a
photography budget.

Kosicki supports including a
student darkroom in the new union
and even suggests purchasing a

yearly membership to fund chemi-

cal and maintenance costs, which

would lower expenses.
“Davidson needs a new user-

friendly facility,” adds Kosicki.

day. Chancellor Dennis Seavers
calls the turnout “excellent” and
the election “efficient.”

Though she lost her first bid
for office in her sophomore year,
Freeman served as Warner Hall’s
representative to the SGA during
the Spring 1995 term. In April of
that year she went on to wina place
as president of the junior class.

Her goal is simple: “I’m a
talker,” she says. “So many people
don’t know the issues on campus
... | want to get them talking.”

‘The buzzword for her cam-
paign was “communication,” and
Freeman is excited about her role
as a liaison between the SGA, the
students, and the faculty.

“’ ve already had three or four
people approach me. ... That’s
great,” she says, “I’m glad people
already feel they can come to me.”

Freeman’s most recent work

in the SGA involved the move for’

minors at: Davidson. Though she

mustresign as co-chair of the Coun-
cil on Academic Affairs, which
has been the main organization
behind the proposal, Freeman in-
tends to keep pushing for their
approval.

She says that chances that
Davidson students will be allowed
to declare minors in the coming
years are “improving.”

“The faculty just need to hear
from students,” she adds.

Regarding her opponents
Freeman says, “All candidates
brought out issues I hope they’ll
help us address.” :

Saintsing and Dervan, tw
other candidates for Vice Presi-
dent, pledged to do so. “Just be-
cause [elections are] over doesn’t
mean [the issues] go away,” says
Saintsing.

Dervan agrees: “I’m going to
pursue them just as if I were Vice
President.”

Buford was confirmed by the

Senate at last Tuesday’s meeting. —

Both he and Freeman took the oath
of office at an inaugural reception
held Sunday evening.
