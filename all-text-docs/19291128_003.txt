Side Line Shots

At the Final Clash of the Season

By P. R. Alderman

Although an important Big Five game
remains on the Cats’ schedule in the form
of Duke, it is nevertheless true that this
season is already the best in three years.
The clash with Duke today will witness
the fifteenth game with other members
of the Big Five since 1926 and, whether
the Blue Devils are defeated or not, the
Davidson eleven will have the State win
of this yéar as one of the bright lights
of the ’29 seasons

Another Wildkitten team has played
its last game and, although their
season was ‘closed by a loss, things
seem to be more optimistic as to po-
tential varsity material in the first
year squad than in many years. The
season experienced was a 50-50 one,
with two wins, two losses and a tie.
It will have to be admitted at any rate
that they lost to better teams.

One of the main hindrances in the
past to developing a strong varsity from
good freshmen material has been the fail-
ure’ of the frosh to return after their
first year. If this can be remedied this
next year and the prospects pass the re-
quired amount of work. there is very lit-
tle to keep Monk and Tex from turning
a team that will make a strong bid for
* championship honors.

As usual, comparative scores can’t
be relied upon to any great extent to -
predict the outcome of the David-
Duke game today. The Blue Devils
defeated State 19-12 while the Wolf-
pack bowed to us to the tune of 13-0,
which is in favor of the Wildcats. On
the other hand, however, Duke
trounced Wake Forest 20-0 while the
Deacons licked Davidson 6-0.

One of the encouraging things about
this year’s fresh team is the possibility
they’ve shown of developing a passing
combination that will be able to compete
on practically an even basis with oppo-
nents in the future. With “Buck” Mills on
the heaving end and “Skinny” Pierce and
T. C. Barrier receiving there ‘will exist
an aerial machine that will need plenty of
watching.

Passes haven't played quite as large
a part in Wildcat losses this year as
last; especially in these last games
have the Cats shown a fairly success-

ful defense against an aerial atack.
Their hardest test will probably be
today when they buck up against the
heaves of Duke’s well-known half-
back, Sam Buie, whose passing abil-
ity is one of the main assets of the
Bltie Devils. e

If fair weather prevails this afternoon
there should be thrills aplenty for every-
one. Both elevens boast speedy backs,
whose running has been hampered in the
past couple of games by too much rain
and who will be ready to make up for
some of this ground loss. Unless the field
is muddy there will undoubtedly be some
aerial journeys in store for the old pig-
skin also.

The Wildcats will be fighting with
extra vigor today to balance up the
won and loss column for the season
while the Blue Devils will be striving
with double energy for a win to keep
their slate in the state clean. They
have downed State and Wake Forest
and should Davidson receive the same
treatment only Carolina would remain
to keep the championship away from
Duke, leaving the latter second-place
without question.

Kitten Eleven Bows

To Duke Frosh Team

The Duke Blue Imps handed out a 26
to 6 defeat to the Davidson Wildkittens
at Durham last Friday. The weather was
very cold and the play of both teams
handicapped by sleet and ice.

The ice did much to break up the pass-
ing of both teams, but it was by the over-
head route that the Kittens succeeded in
putting their tally. A long
heave from Buck Mills to Barrier was the

over lone
scoring play.

The Tips showed a strong team in ev-
of held the
Freshman running attack well in check
during most of the game. In the mean-

ery department play and

time, they succeeded in putting over four
touchdowns, one of which was the result
of avblocked punt,

DAVIDSON TO MEET DUKE

(Continued from Page 1)
Day. Furthermore both clubs have compara-
tively good records to date.

Davidson has defeated such representa-
tive teams as The Citadel and N. C. State.
Against a great Army team the Wildcats
made a most impressive showing in the eyes
of the nation by holding them to a compara-
tively small score. Despite the numerous de-
feats at the hands of powerful Eastern
teams, Duke has a record that is not to be
laughed at. Her timely defeat of L. S. U.
attracted much attention as well as upset
the dope bucket. In addition she has on her
belt the scalps of Wake Forest and N. C.
State. Despite the fact that the dope points
slightly to Duke, not one Wildcat follower
will admit the superiority of the Blue Devils.

In addition to the great rivalry between
the 'Cat and the Blue Devil, the contest
will have a decided bearing on the state title.
Should Davidson emerge victor, she would
be in an excellent position to tie for second
place with Duke, it being generally conceded
that they will be beaten by Carolina. A vic-
tory over the ’'Cats would put Duke into its
final game with the Tar Heels on an even
footing. In this case the Davidson-Duke game
would be the deciding factor in the title
chase.
