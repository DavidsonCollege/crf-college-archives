cats’ tracks

By LESTER ABERGER

In a secret vote, Davidson’s football players
made it clear that they did not want Bob Mosketti
to be their new head coach.

The varsity players exhibited an unheard of
sense of activism. The move shows that the
athletes are concerned about the future of their
sport at Davidson and that they are unwilling to ac-
cept a passive role.

The tradition here of players vs. coaches has
been rooted in apathy and secrecy. Objections were
spoken behind closed doors and out of the public
eye. The football players should be commended for
their concern and willingness to take action.

In the light of this, it is imperative for the college
to include an active varsity football representative
on the committee that will select the new head
coach.

A player who participates in the football
program here would undoubtedly be a most aware,
informed, and sensitive observer of the football
team. Such a person would be highly attuned to the
coaching needs of our football am.

As far as I know this would be unprecedented.
But by placing an active ball player on the selection
committee Davidson would show that it is aware of
and concerned with the needs of its athletes.

The new athletic policy as outlined in last week’s
DAVIDSONIAN evokes a few comments. The
athletic director is the key man in the new
program. He determines the football and basket-
ball budgets and administers funds to the minor
sports.

It is his job to prescribe the duties of the coaching
staff. Most important, he is called on to render a
complete study of the staff needs for all sports. In
short, Cartmill, the new athletic director, has a
great responsibility .

Obviously the administration and the Trustees
have great faith in Cartmill. It is good policy to
usher in a new athletic era at Davidson with a new
athletic director. We can be sure that Cartmill will
be under close scrutiny during the next few
months.

Advice? As he goes about completing his various
duties he should frequently consult the people par-
ticipating in the sports programs. A viable, ef-
fective athletic program at Davidson can work only
when it is designed to meet the needs of the par-
ticipants themselves.

When these things are so, then Davidson’s
athletic policy will really be ‘essential elements in
the life of the college.”’

JVs Use Defensive Tactics

En Route To Fine 8-2 Record

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Assistant Managing Editor

The Davidson Junior Var-
sity basketball team, curren.
tly 8 and 2, is plainly an exam-
ple of a good team that has
become an excellent one
through the virtues of a true
team play. The individual con-
tributions are of little con-
sequence as compared to the
over-all success of the team as
a unit.

Coach Jim  Larranaga
names defense as the team’s
strength. He emphasizes that
it is team defense, and good
team defense at that.

“We have learned a lot
about team defense,

especially in the last few
games. . . We held Lees-
McRae scoreless for six
minutes in the second half of
that game,”’ said Larranaga.
‘‘We played good defense
against Wake Forest too,
although we lost.

“Our main problem thusfar
has been inconsistancy at the
offensive end of the floor. We
either score or have a tur-
nover.’’ Larranaga said. “I
think our inexperience is at
least partially responsible for
these turnovers, which of
course we don’t want.”’

The team has been relying
heavily on the playmaking of
two freshmen, Marvin Lively,
and Jerry Stallworth, who had
never played in the guard
position before coming to
Davidson. Larranaga names
this kind of inexperience as
the reason behind mafiy of the

turnovers that have plagued —

the team during their first 10

games.

In the last six games, ap-
parently after it became
evident that the team was
good, the opponents have been

pressing the young Cats full
