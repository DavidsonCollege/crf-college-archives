Cats snap UNCG’s 33-game SoCon
unbeaten streak on Connor’s late goal

After a shaky September road
trip, the women’s soccer program
proved its full potential with some
October magic over the weekend.
By defeating perennial powerhouse
UNC-Greensboro on Friday night,
the team whipped up the confi-
dence to ice off a hot Elon team on
Sunday.

Before Friday night’s skirmish,
the UNC-Greensboro Spartans had
not lost a regular season confer-
ence matchup in 33 games. That
amounts to three years of domi-
nating the SoCon. The struggling
’Cats, on the other hand, were
coming off five road losses and an
0-2 conference start. Strutting into
Alumni Stadium, the Spartans must
have predicted quick work of Da-
vidson.

Their expectations were quick-
ly dashed. The first half descended
into a drudge match, the teams
were even in every column of the
stat sheet. While UNC-G may have
held the advantage in pure shoot-
ing ability, the "Cats made up for
it with smart possession and coor-
dinating team composure. Despite
a couple of scares, they concluded

the half drawn nil-nil.

Building confidence over the
course of the first half, the "Cats
were poised to strike in the second.
And they waged their attack with a
fury. Just two minutes in, an errant
ball found itself rolling around the
Spartans’ 18-yard box. After the
defense misread the clear, Court-

ney Hart ’10 snagged the ball and
pelted it toward the near post. A
baffled UNC-G defense could not
react.

Davidson slipped back into a
defensive slouch for the next 10
minutes, staking out positions deep

Davidson field hockey defeated
UC Davis Thursday night 4-2, end-
ing their seven game losing streak.
Coach Ginny Sutton commented,

| a

Christine Rua °12 was one of
four different Wildcats to score
in the 4-2 win over UC-Davis.

“Our offensive attack was great to-
night. They moved the ball around
very well its very good to have
four different goal scorers coming
through.” The first two goals in the
first half came from ’Cats’ Jennie
Mostellar *11 and Christine Rua
°12, with her fifth goal of the sea-
son.

Davidson took control of the
second half, scoring the next two
goals of the game a little after the
half-way point. Courtney Tobe

*11 scored the first point, followed

shortly by Brit Donaldson ’13 for
her first career goal.

UC Davis attempted a come-
back with two goals scored late in
the second half by Ashley Haight
and Nadia Namdari. Coach Sutton
was complementary of the team ef-
fort and hopes the win will give the
team added confidence in the up-
coming conference games.

With composure gained from
their win over UC Davis, the ’Cats
soundly defeated Catawba 7-0 on
Saturday, Oct. 3 at home on the

Belk Turf Field. Catawba was un-
able to make a single shot through-
out the match, while Davidson had
42 shots, 21 of which were on goal.
The win was a definite team effort
with 6 out of the 7 goals scored by
different team members.

Hannah English ’12 opened the
scoring in the 15th minute of the
match and then added a second goal
to the scoreboard only five minutes
later. Clare Perry *11 scored the
third goal, followed by a goal by
Finley Amato ”13 to close the first
half at 4-0. Donaldson scored the
first goal of the second half. The
final two goals of the match were
scored with under five minutes left
in the game by Gray Robinson ’12
and Donaldson.

With the victories, the Wildcats
improved their record to 4-8 and
1-2 in the NorPac. Next weekend
Davidson will travel to Richmond,
Virginia to play Saint Louis on Sat-
urday and then Virginia Common-
wealth on Sunday. Both games will
start at 1 p.m.

Wildcats rally past Charleston in
overtime, begin SoCon play 2-0

After an impressive start, Da-
vidson men’s soccer has not let up.
Last week, Davidson opened con-
ference play against the College of
Charleston on Wednesday night at
Alumni Stadium. Despite a slow
start, Davidson rallied back to win
their conference opener in overtime
by a score of 3-2.

Davidson continued conference
play on Saturday in Statesboro, GA
against Georgia Southern, blanking
them by a score of 3-0 to improve
to 8-1 on the season. This season,
Davidson has been nothing short
of incredible, extending their win
streak to six games and their record
to 8-1.

To kick things off on Wednes-
day night, College of Charles-
ton made an offensive statement,
showing Davidson early that win-
ning their conference opener would
be no easy task.

At the 18:24 mark, College of
Charleston took the lead. Zach
Prince slid the ball in to the far left
post when Chip Sanders ’12 came
out to challenge him to put CofC
up 1-0. The Cougars struck again
soon after when they fired a ball
in past Sanders right outside of the
18 yard box. Going into the half,
things looked grim for Davidson as

WEDNESDAY,

College of Charleston led 2-0.

Davidson needed to increase
the offensive pressure in the sec-
ond half if they wanted to beat C
of C. The tension mounted and
things did not look good for Da-
vidson until there were 20 minutes
remaining. Davidson finally capi-
talized on their fifth cu:ner kick of
the game when Charlie Reiter ’10
passed the ball from the far corner
to Allen Page ’12 who headed it in
to put Davidson on the board and
down by a score of 2-1.

Less than one minute later, Da-
vidson fiercely drove down the field
to score again and knot the match
up at 2-2. Yannick Pilgrim *11
drove the ball down the right side
of the field and crossed the ball to
a streaking Reiter who powered the
ball into the upper right corner of
the net. Regulation would end in a
tie, sending the match to overtime.

In overtime, Machel Turner °10
was fouled inside the box, giving
Alex Caskey ’11 a penalty kick
opportunity. Caskey fired the ball
in his usual clutch fashion, putting
Davidson up 3-2 and giving them
the come from behind win. This
was Caskey’s third penalty kick
conversion and second game win-
ner of the season.
