Democratic Government
This week’s Davidsonian carries an ac-

count of the new plan which has been adopt-
ed by the. student council, our governittg
body, to clean up dirty politics and to quiet
all the agitation that has come into_being
since the first of the year. Adopting in part
a suggestion made in the Davidsonian the
1940 elections will have locked ballot boxes
and registry of voters. The council also
goes on record in favor of continuing the
present system. Well, this is fine, but the
change falls far short of any successful
cleanup of illegal electoral activities at
Davidson.

Since January 1 our editorial pages have
beéiy taken up with comments on the politi-
cal situation here both pro and con. Your
editor has been accused of everything from
trying to fill up space to rabble rousing and
playing politics himself. The students have
asked why the paper doesn't put forward a
definite goal in this fight..Our answer this
week is simple: the Davidsonian wants ev-
ery fellow to have a chance, but an equal
chance, im seeing his candidate and his vote
through—and we won’t be satisfied and
won't stop fighting until we are sure that
this goal -has~been- achieved for 1940 and
every other year.

The students have ‘two alternatives, -as-
suming that they want to have minds of
their own instead of dictatorship by a small
clique. Davidson must either have closed
politics with a democratic representation
that permits no combines of any sort, or
we must_have open politics where every-
one can have the equal right to campaign.
If we-are to have the first system, our elec-
tion laws and definitions of combines, etc.,
must be in black and white.,The only other
course must be open politics with no holds
barred. There’s no middle road that is re-
spectable and above board. Take your
choice,

The Davidsonian’s Plan

We don't want to hurtanybody’s feelings,
but we truly feel from. observing the ‘past
few years that the student council is unable
to successfully cope with the situation and
attend to its other duties’ to the best ad-
yantage. Keeping politics clean is a full-
time job and a hard one. \WWe want a board
of elections to function the entire year.
This board will have equal representation,
one man.from each fraternity, and three
non-fraternity men, tavo student councilmen
and two, non-councilmen, Furthermore, these
men have got to be fully acquainted with
conditions as they are. It’s nicesto feel that
Davidson men are superior to any wrong-
doing, but-while looking up at the angels
we are quite likely to slip up on the slime
that’s oozing about. Our national laws de-
clare a man innocent until he is guilty, but
that can go*too far. Just because an act is
illegal is no sign it won’t be committed.
Let this board be on the alert to nip dirty
politics in the bud before they haye gone too
far for even the student council, with all its
powers, to correct:

This board will supervise elections, count-
ing the ballots, and will define on paper for
evéryone to ‘read just what sort of thing a
combine is. We don’t want a system where
whole groups of men get disfranchised be-
cause they cast a solid vote for one cardi%
date, but where on the other hand individ-
ual members of a small clique can go out
and influence enough of their personal
friends to swing an ‘election. The danger
from that sort of combine far exceeds the

resent defined idea of fraternity combines.

enalties for combinations must be so se-
vere that our budding politicians will look
twice before risking their necks. If a cli-
que knew that its candidate would be struck
from the ballot if their odorous activities
became known, dirty politics would be ‘at
a minimum,

Faults Of The Council Plan

To get back to this new plan set forth
by the council. Instead of forever destroying
the evil it opens a gap bigger than any loop-
holes we have ever had in the history of

student government at Davidson. True we
will have real ballot boxes, true that ‘we
will have student registration; but the
votes themselves will not be signed.. This
merely means that all evidence of future
combines will be destroyed. What a beauti-
ful setup! No matter how hard the council
tries to discover a combine, the accused
only have to demand concrete evidence that
suspected persons cast a solid vote for one
man; only a handwriting expert will be able
to save our rulers’ faces. Then too, the
votes should be counted by just such an im-
partial board as we advocate. When a new
student body president, a new Davidsonian
or Quips and Cranks editor is being elected,
the old president and editors should not be
present. If they are interested in their suc-
cessor, they must attend to this before the
actual balloting. After the votes have been
cast their hands are tied, and legally they
can do nothing about it. :

Things are in a bad shape when a group
of men begin to feel that it’s smart to be
crooked. Certain members-of-the-Davidson
studént body have adopted the old Spartan
code that anything is all right—the crime
is being caught. But remember, what we
are today is what we will be twenty. years
from now—only more so. The Davidsonian
doésn’t want a student government; it
wants a government of the students. We
appeal to the student body to make David-
son democratic!

The following letter was received
from the President of the Student Body
of the College of William and Mary.

Mr. Erle Austin, Associate Editor
The Davidsonian :
Davidson College, Davidson, N. C.

My Dear Erle,

Davidson is- evidently plagued with the
same problem of “dirty politics” with which
we are troubled here at William and Mary.
For a good many years a fraternity clique
won in all elections, Last year, however, the
fraternities “on the out” and the Independ-
ents, whom I led, managed to put up a good
fight, and this organization won a majority
of the offices by a narrow margin. Now if
this situation could be maintained, it would
work fine, because there would always be
enough rebels within each group to pre-
vent anyone from being certain of an of-
fice, and both sides would be compelled to
nominate their best men. However, this
cannot be counted on, and-a workable plan
would be as acceptable to those hete who
really desire student government as it would
be at many other schools in the country.

Our student government. at William and
Mary ts complicated by the necessity of a
separate Women’s Student Government As-
sociation apart from the regular class and
student body offices. We have a Student
Activities Committee composed of the Pres-
ident of the Men's Student Body, and the
President of the Women’s Student Body,
the editors of the three publications, the
presidents of the two debate councils, and
four faculty members. This body. must ap-
prove petitions for nomination to class and
student body offices, the elections for which
are then held under the supervision of the
President of the Men’s Student Body and
his committee 6n elections.

Besides having control of elections, the
S. A. Co has control of approving budgets for
all student funds, and general supervision of
the debate councils, publications, and stu-
dent government.

To be -truthful, however, real student
government at William and Mary does not
exist, or-at least is not as complete as it
might be. The officers of the administration
say that they are willing that the students
should govern, but the politics must be
cleaned up before more power is placed in
the hands of the officers. The fraternities
say that they are willing to reform just as
soon as sufficient power is placed in the
hands of the officers to necessitate reform.
Thus you have a rather hopeless. situation.
The coeds’ organization really has no power,
but-the elections are at least“clean-”

I imagine you have written to other
schools, and if you would send me a copy of
the Davidsonian in which the various replies
are publisied, I would appreciate it.

Very truly yours,
JOHN S. HUDSON, President,
Men’s. Student Body.

In Defense!!

There is and always has been a bit of
resentment among the students because of
the Annual assessments placed on the class-
es and various societies for their space in
the annual. An argument is always pre-
sented that when the student matriculates
he pays for his space in the annual. This is
true to a certain extent but this pays only
for his space in his class section. The
sponsor of the class had to be paid for and
who is to pay for that but the class itself.
The only income that the annual has is from
these campus fees and advertisements. This
is hardly an ample sum to pay for a $7,000
annual, figure it out for yourself. There is
much space in the annual for which there“is
no income at all to pay for it. For instance,
the athletic, «music, snapshot,’ and ROTC
sections. These sections run into great ex-
pense and from what source are they ‘to be
paid from but the student body. It is true
that these sections could be jeft out but
what would you have left then? They are

The faculty of business and law

by the opportunities for work in a
new field at a time when the estab-

The new bill is-aimed directly-at
the tendency to favor Harvard

is a mainstay on

a part of the life on the campus
and the idea of the annual is to
portray as vividly as possible the
life upon the campus.

Davidson has always produced an
annual that ranks among the best
for a college of its size. It seems
that a college annual is a necessary
evil, if it may be called that, and if
this evil is to be continued it must
be paid for. The question arises
here, do you want an annual that
is worthy of the college and the
students? The annual could be made
smaller, it could be cut down to a

cost of $5,000 or even $2,500. But
do you want an annual of this type?

I think that the majority of the
students would rather have the “an-
nual as it is,

Another argument presented is
that the burden of the expense is
placed on the senior class. Well,
why shouldn't this be? The annual
is the senior class book and they
take up the majority of the space
in the book. Why shouldn't they
pay more than the members of the
other three classes.

Still another argunient is brought
up. There is fraud in the annual,
the editor and business manager
make a killing every year. This is
one of the biggest misconceptions

that has ever been on this campus.
The annual has to keep strict books

.and every ‘cent that comes in and

goes out must be accounted for and
the books are audited by members
of the faculty. The accounting sys-
tem is air tight and there is no
chance for misappropriation of
funds. I wish that the student body
would take this matter into mind.

The average cost of each page.

in the annual is between $40 and
$50 and if every organization Seas
charged according to the spaccht
they occupy in the book, as is done
in many schools, there is no doubt

that there would be a different tune

sung.

The assessments this year were
raised a little-becauseofa-debt-of
last year’s annual which was ab-
sorbed by this’ year’s annual, for
there was no other fund frem which
this debt could be paid.

I sincerely hope that’ this will
help to clear up many of the ques-
tions in the students minds as to
theassessments..placed upon them
and if anyone ever desires to ex-
amine the annual’s books he is more
than welcome to.
