Davidson is known as that
little college down in North

Carolina. somewhere that
produces All American

Scholars. College Bowlers

and Secretaries of State, but

Yes. Virginia. Davidson

does have a baseball team.

which until recently could
be found buried in the debzis
of the Southern Conference
cellar. ,

This vear, however, the
Wildcats have actually been
threatening to have fome
control in the confetence
race, and behind a freshman-
oriented pitching staff, of all
things. they've been doing
it. .

all.

Davidson coach Tom Scott
termed the event ‘‘a fine
tournament on a tough, tra-
dition steeped course. Pine-
hurst is one of the nation’s
top courses.”

Lack of depth and an in-
jury to fourth man Danry
White doomed the ‘Cats’ title
hopes. White hurt his back
in the first round and took
an opening day 89 to prevent
him from playing for score.

_J2y EE ne,

We didn't have the depth
we had last year. Scott said.
“The top men did well but
the lower half of the team
wasn’t as tsrong as last
year's, and that made the
difference.

“East Carolina had the
same team this year but won
because: their balance was

better than ours. The Pirates |

and Furman didn't have one
of their seven scores higher
than 82 but we had three
over 84."

Scott was optimistic over
next season's chances. "East
Carolina will graduate a lot
of their team. We'll lose
Spann and K. D. Weeks, but
we have some good freshmen
on the way." ;

Spann may still get an in-
vitation to attend the NCAA
tournament if the competi-
tors are chosen individualiy
instead of by championship
team. according to Scott.

IMAC softball in a topsy-

Mary Baldwin Netters
To Challenge Fogleman

By DON PARMAN.
Asst. Sports Editar

Tennis coach Harry Fagle-
man, not. waiting for the
report of the coeducation
committee. has planned his
own coed weekend with the
Mary Baldwin tennis team.

Dr. Mary Donnalley “Mary
Baldwin athletic director and
tennis coach, will bring eight
members of the Mary Bald-
win team for two days of
tennis exhibitions against the
Wildcats May 16 and 17.

Fogleman called the Mary
Baldwin tennis program ‘‘as
good a girls’ program as
there is in the country. They
have several girls who are
highly ranked. not only high-
ly ranked but good looking.”

The exhibition has been in
the planning stages for sev-
eral years but “just never
got off the ground,"’ accord-
ing to Fogleman.

“It’s just a social weekend
of tennis."

Meanwhile the Wildcat
netters are in Charleston, S.
C., this weekend for a tess
social occasion, the Southern
Conference tournament.

Davidson is given virtual-
ly no charice to retain the
conference crown they have
held for the last four seasons.
The Citadel and Furman are
the early picks for new

Garner homered for the

SPE’s.

The Delts beat~the Indies
despite a seven run Indepen-
dent rally in the last inning
and ‘‘Aristotle’’ Anderson's
two runs batted in.

In a very important Tues-
day game the Phi Delts edg-
ed the Sig Eps, 8-3. The vic.
tory was largely a matter
of the Delts being able to
put their hits together, while
the SPE’s left numerous run-
ners stranded. The game was
close until the last inning.
when the Delts scored four
runs.

On Wednesday the KA’s
demolished the Beta's 23-2.
John Chalk had two doubles
and a triple and Romey Fish-
er hit two home runs.

There was a rash of for-
feits in this week’s games.
The Pi Kapps forfeited two
games, to the Sigma Nus
and SAE‘s. The other forfeits
were the Kappa Sigs to the
ATO’'s and the SAE’s to the
Kappa Sigs.

In one of the most impor-
tant games so far this sea-
son the Delts took over first
place with a hard-fought 8-4
over the Machis on Thurs.
day. Dave Fearnbach paced
the’ Delts by hitting two
home runs, one with the
bases loaded.

The win left the Deltc a
half game ahead of the ATO’s
and a full game ahead of the
faltering Sigma Chis.

in other action yesterday,
the Sig Eps continued their
bid for the title as they de-
feated the Betas, 18-6, des-
pite the absence of several
regulars. The KA‘’s won
again, handing the pre-sea-
son favorite Kappa Sigs an
18-9 loss.

The Sigma Nus edged the
Indies 14-13. while the Pikas
beat the Betas 186.

The championship could
possibly be decided’ next week
when the Delts meet the
ATO’s on Monday. However,
the Taus still have to play
the Machis next Tnursday.

The overall league balance

has been the best of amy
sport this year. There has al-
ways been the possibility of
an upset.
The reason for this phe
nomenon is the switch to
slow-pitch softball. No. long-
er can a pitcher dominate
the action and carry his team
virtually alone. The game is
now more interesting because
of the possibility of upsets.
and it seems that the switch
to slow-pitch has been a guod
one.

“William and Mary is de-
finitely favored,.’" comment-
ed coach Heath Whittle as
he prepared his Wildcat cind-
*rmen for the Southern Con-
ference Track Meet, which
begins this afternoon at Fort
Eustis.

Whittle noted that last year
William and = Mary _ Scored
over 60 points more than its
closest competitor, and most
of the members of that squad
are back. He feels that they
have the “top men in practi-
cally ail of the events.”

Even though the Wildcats
as a team have no chance
for a high finish in the mect,
there is the possibility of
some ‘strong individual per-
formances.

Twelve Wildcats are mai:

Stagg Newman, stitl botbered
