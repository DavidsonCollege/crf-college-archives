SPORTS

By Bill Godwin

Figures Misleading?

HOW DO you go about forecasting the winner of a
football game? One approach is comparative scores. For
Davidson and Presbyterian is goes something like this:

LENOIR-Rhyne 30, Wofford 6.

Wofford 6, Davidson 0.

Lenoir-Rhyne 8, Presbyterian 0. |

Presbyterian 21, Wofford 7.

THESE ARE the cold facts—and the Wildcats here
are shivering. But more often than not, cold facts do not
by themselves win a ballgame. Things like potential and
team attitude and partisan spirit count heavily. That's
why we hope to see you in Clinton, S. C., at 8 tomorrow
night. It’s only 96 miles from. here as the car flies.

AND WHO said: “A news reporter is one who writes
about subjects on which he can command no authority?”
Bear with us, please. And we'll take Pittsburgh in six.

IMAC To
Fix Rules

A pretest by the ATO fratern-
ity this week over a disputed
flickerball game last week was
thrown out by the Intramural
Athletic Council, but the pro-
test did produce an IMAC move
to revise the rules and regula-
tions of its constitution.

Meeting Wednesday night,
IMAC delegated a committee
of three to work out the revi-
sion: Chairman Worth William-
son, SAE; Buddy Brauch, Sig-
ma Nu; and Spud Stewart, ATO.

Williamson said Wednesday
the revision would be complet-
ed “in about three weeks.”

FORFEIT?

The question arose Monday,
a week ago, whether sopho-
mores who received freshman
football letters were eligible to
play Intramural flickerball and,
if not, was the game in ques-
tion—Beta vs. ATO—to be for-

booth calling every play. The relay went from Dole to
the bench, then to
hees or Usher. Finally, Tucker told his teammates what
to do. “You get a better view from up here,” said Dole.
He may try it again tomorrow night.

Out Of Sight, Breath

THE INDIANS from Pembroke were here last Friday
for a cross-country meet. It brought back memories of
two years ago when the Injuns left the starting line in a
cloud of dust and were out of sight before the Wildcat
harriers reached second gear. But the two teams
switched positions before long. Pembroke was out of
breath.

AND THE prettiest new face on campus belongs to
Marilyn (Mrs. Hub) Knox. Hub is a sophomore, Marilyn
the sports publicity secretary.

What Others Say About Us

IN A story headlined “No Inchee, No Tickee” two
weeks back, THE MECKLENBURG TIMES had this to
say: “Big game around these parts was Davidson's vic-
tory over Catawba last Saturday. Tee Redding, the Wild-
cats’ quarterback, tossed for one touchdown and threw
a pass to set up another touchdown. Tee, who was all-
conference when playing for Asheboro High School, is
playing his last year for Davidson. And then off to the
Army.” (Tee’s wife Connie works for the paper).

“DAVIDSON is a mighty ,fine school scholastically
but unfortunately—like Slippery Rock, Hofstra or Bates
—jit doesn’t rate much national mention except during
the football] season.

“NOW JF Dr. Tom Scott will measure the aforesaid
words into inches, we should rate a ticket or two to the
next Davidson football game.” (The article, we suspect,
was written out of spite. Two TIMES reporters had
called for 14 tickets to the Davidson-Catawba game. Dr.
Scott said he’d give them a ticket for each inch of type
they printed that week about the game. No inchee, no
tickee).

How To Make An Enemy

NO NATIONAL mention? That's not gonna sit very
well with a lot of Davidson coaches—Whittle, Driesell,
Stevens, Marrotte, Parker, Dole, Thrift, Hunt, Shoe, and
Scott.

A FEW days ago the sports publicity office received
a letter from a Mr. Walter Hebda of Los Angeles. It said
in part: I've been following the Wildcats for a long time,
and am writing to you to ask about this year’s team and
to wish vou lots of luck for a very successful season,

despite the Wofford game. The Catawba game must have

feited by the ATO’s?

The ATO's played two ‘such
sophomores on its team that
day.

IMAC ruled Wednesday that
the Betas had won the game
by forfeit.

day, results look like this:

The Citadel brought its Southern Conference foot-
ball record up to 1-1 Saturday with its 21-15 victory
over the Davidson Wildcats, who scored the final
touchdown after time had run out. The Wildcats’ con-
ference record stands at 0-1.

Whittle. It was a fulfillment of
the promise he showed as a
member of the freshman squad.

Further, Coach Whittle pre-
dicts that Sterling will be one
of the top six or seven runners
in Southern Conference cross-
country competition this year.

But Martin is reluctant about
any immediate praise, “It was
hardly a test,” he says. ‘Pem-

broke didn't push us very
hard.”
Coach Whittle agrees and

adds, “The team is not in top

shape yet. The real test will be /

the meets with Wake Forest

and The Citadel this week.”

Tomorrow a Davidson Wildcat football team that
has, in the words of head coach Bill Dole, “found out
they could do a job” meets the strong Presbyterian
Blue Hose at Johnson Field in Clinton, S. C.. Kickoff

time will be 8:00 p.m.

The Wildcats hope to put
damper on Presbyterian's
Homecoming festivities by re-
versing a heart-breaking 25-21
defeat at the hands of these

This series, which dates from
1919, has found Davidson as
winner in 18 of these contests

games have ended in ties.
COME OF AGE
Last Saturday, while the

Wildcats were ‘coming of age”
against a tough Citadel team,
the Blue Hose of Coach Frank
Jones rolled up an impressive
21-7 victory over the Wofford
Terriers

According to Coach Dole,
“Presbyterian will have as good
a team as we face all season
(with the exception of V.P.1).”

The Hose operate their team
from a Wing-T, which they
execute to perfection in a
strong wall of blockers headed
by Little All-American Tackle
Billy Ogden.

CRUCIAL TEST
This offensive unit will be a

}erucial test for the strong 'Cat

defenses.

Davidson's defensive unit will
be hurt Saturday by the loss
of their outstanding sophomore
line-backer, Joe Ansley, who
will not be able to play beeause
of a chest injury.
