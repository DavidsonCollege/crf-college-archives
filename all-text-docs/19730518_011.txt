CAPTAIN AMERICA

Well. CA. and Y.B will get
the worst out of the way right
away. The SPE’s gunned down
the Faimes unmererully 4-3 on
Tuesday throwing all the soft
ball leagues into total con
fusion

A three run rally in the sixth
by the SPE’s took the game as
they capitahzed on thr ee SIF
errors in the inning along with
some clutch hitting. Bill
Alexander continully had the
SIF’s popping into easy outs. A
tough break for a bunch of bad
competitors, the SIF's

In other games Q-12
acknowledged themselves as
the only undefeated team in
IMAC as the nipped KK’s 4-2
behind the Wop’s pitching. The
12 really nice guys are going to
goa long way.

Earlier Q-12 had crushed the
PKA’'s 16-1 as the Queen" Rob
Flame Benton and the human
Beach Ball powered the way.

League B is really wild these
days as each of the top teams
continue to knock each other
off.

These last few days saw
Emanon get clenched by the
Delt seniors, 9-1, led again by
the pitching of ‘‘Straight”’ Ernst.
Then Emanon got ragged
as they jumped on the Derbies
and upset them 8-6.

The Pope and His Court
picked up a forfeit and stayed
ahead of this mess at 7-1. PDT
seniors now follow at 6-1 while
the Derbies and Emanon are
both 6-2.

In League C, S-3 was crun-
ched by the KA's 14-3 to end
their unbeaten string. S-3 is now
a shade behind Q-12 at 8-1.
League A shows F & M #1

Softball finishes up this week
with the tournament taking

place next week involving the

top four teams from each
league. The track meet takes
place next Monday = and
Tuesday also.

Seeing how this is the last
issue, C.A.“and Young Buck
would like to hand out their
1972-73 awards and recall
sme of the more insane mo-
ments of the IMAC year.

- First and foremost ‘is our
most coveted award, the JIM-
MY PIERSALL AWARD. The
Jimmy Piersall Award is for
the athlete that most typifies
the ideals and actions of Jimmy
Piersall. (No, C.A. and Young
Buck did not give it to them-
selves.) The nominees were

and Dennis Cholak. But the win-
ner, from the Pika house was
that immortal umpire baiter
and goofball — Mike “Ding-
Dong" Deese

Our next award was indeed a
simple matter. The only
nominee was a hands down
choice who simply outclassed
the opposition.

Our ‘72-'73 recipient of the
RAG AWARD is a repeater
from last year, the man who is
permanently on the rag, Duke
Sims. Salutations are definitely
in order.

Simsby will get ragged at
anything no matter how useless
it may be. Sometimes he
doesn't need that much to get
him started

Probably this next award is a
serious award. or at least as
serious as YB. and CA can
make it. The prestigious MR
IMAC trophy donated by the
Bike Athletic Supporter Co.
commonly known as the Bike
Cup. is this vear presented to
D.C.'’s jock of jocks the im-
mortal James C. Brown and his
boys of renown (the Delts). Our
hats are off and our pants are
down to J.B.

The vear’s honoree for the
famed IRON GLOVE goes to
that medical wizard, the ever-
present malpracticing Tom
“Dr. Goose” Soos.

Son of Mother Goose made
the easy ones look hard and just
flopped as the hard ones went
by. Iron Glove was. given credit
for one putout this year when a
ground ball bouncing, in his
vicinity, killed a player that the
Goose had clumsily tripped.

The NO SHOW award is a
unanimous choice without a
doubt this year. The faculty
were outstanding in their ef-
forts to non-appear this year.
Consistency was their
trademark as the intellects did

not even have rumors that they

might show up An unfortunate
idea is circulating around cam-
pus that the Sam Spencer's
merely entered a faculty team
to pick up the fabled forfeit
trophy. We certainly hope that
this is not so. The forfeit award
will be placed in the stall of the
3rd Belk bathroom as none of
the professors showed to pick
up their trophy

The coveted ADAM'S APPLE
AWARD without a doubt goes
to those jokers of chokers the
infamous AT Zeroes. The
trophy consisting of a golden
noose reportedly was used in
the recent death of Steve Can-
terbury who died of suffocation
However. Canterbury's last
statement was something to the
effect that “I vow school will
end © Uh oh. could be a real
long spring term = Canterbury
hasn't been mghtin his lite How
could the turnovers lose six one
run games ina row

Some of the highlights of last
vear were obvious Dean Will

ring was broken up in early
January, but the Dean was

trial

The emergence of a new
power. 7?) in D.C emerged with
the promotion of the United
Wimpire of Watts I. Out-
standing wimps all, this crew
shall be reckoned with the next
few vears. Look for C.A. and
Y.B.’s new book this summer,
“The Rise and Fall of the 3rd
Wimpire.” To those of you
whose feats or mistakes we
may have missed. we say —
tough break

dahism while Young Buck 1s

study in the field of gasoline

Krishnas “Bhagavadgita’’, by

you always match and may you
never tilt.
