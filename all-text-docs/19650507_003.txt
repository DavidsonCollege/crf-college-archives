Turner Sets Record

Highlighting a track victory over Wake Forest, Alan
Turner ran the 100 yard: dash in 9.5 seconds last Satur-
day, eclipsing the old school record of 9.6 set in 1929 by
John Curry.

: Equally as impressive as Turner’s record was David-
son’s 72-69 victory over Wake Forest, a school which
subsidizes their track program.

Track coach Heath Whittle pointed out that David-
son has not lost a dual track meet this year, having lost
only to East Tennessee State in the Davidson Relays.

Their won-lost record now stands at 5-1.
Ronnie Reese lacked only .1 of a second to set an-

other school record, the 880.

He ran it in 1:57.3.

Denny Phillips ran his best mile of the year, finishing

first in a time of 4:23.3.

Lou Hill picked up two seconds and a third in the
hurdles and the triple jump, while Dave Brown garnered
thirds in the high jump and broad jump, and a second

in the pole vault.

Davidson journeys to St. Andrews this Saturday
where they will be running on a new grass-tex track.
Commenting on that meet, Coach Whittle said, “I would-
n't be surprised if Reese or Phillips set school records

down there.”

The Southern Conference track meet will be held
at Furman next Friday and Saturday.

and Phi Delts 17-14 to move into third.

In the Fiji-Phi Delt game, the
Gams were leading after 3 2-3
innings when the Delts explod-
ed. They knocked 7 men around
the bases with the help of 4 er-
rors by the Phi Gams before
the side was retired. The Phi
Delt lead held as the Phi Gams
could not close the gap, and the
final score stood 9-7.

“We lost because of our ‘tight
defense’ in the 3rd_ inning,”
quipped Phi Gam first base-
man Bengie Goodman somewhat
sarcastically.

ning to put the game on ice.

“Our all-round consistent hit-
ting rather than any outstand-
ing power hitter brought the
game around for us,"’ beamed
Sigma Chi right fielder, Bruce
Weihe.

In one of the more decisive
games of the week, the Pikas
rallied to edge the slightly-fa-
vored Phi Delts .17-14.. The
Pikas were behind 10-6 in the
fourth inning when they got hot
behind power hitting to score
eight runs and go ahead 14-10.

Larry Outlaw allowed the Phi
Delts to pick up three more
runs while the Pikas matched
them with three of their own.
Johnny Gresham upped his bat-
ting average with a grand-slam
and six RBI's while teammate
Tom White countered with a
three-run homer of his own.

Brady Dickson, manager of
the Pikas, in commenting on
their playing, said, “All in all
we played pretty good, and our
defense was better than usual.”

will get facts from campus information banks

For example, a question about Chinese 1
could be asked by dial or push buttons any

Students will also be able to telephone an

will send a diagrammed answer back to a

Or, a request for information will be
phoned into a repository —a library, for in-
