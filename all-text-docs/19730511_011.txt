Softball Excitement Continues, °
Showers Put Schedule Behind -

CAPTAIN AMERICA

This past week saw only two
days of games played due to
rain as the season bogged down
a little bit.

Last Wednesday saw the PDG
group up the ATO’s 11-10,
marking the third one run loss
in a row for the hapless AT
zeroes. Seems the turnovers
cannot get the big runs in the
late innings. Oh yes, Stevie Can-
terury vows and swears that
the ATO’s will win their next
game. CA and Bucky can only
say, after both taking probabi-
lity, that the law of averages
will catch up to the ATO’s
sometime.

Seeing as how last week was
‘Rank on a SPE Week,”’ we will
not say anything about the Big
Sig Eps. Final score SPE’s 17,
Cannoneers 5.

A powerhouse team has been
cruising steadily in League C.
Sentelle 3 led by Mark Firth has
compiled a 5-0 record as they
gunned down the previously un-
beaten PDA's 7-2 last week.

The League B_ basketball
champs have a well balanced
team whose strength is hitting.
Their only problem so far ac-
cording to coach Firth, is hiding
their most insignificant player,

Terrible Tommy Blackwood, a
marginal player on a good day.
The Delt seniors have been on

a recent rampage as they have

won their last five games. Last
week they ran past the Kirk-
wood Derbies 12-6. Led by
strong hitting and a fine pit-
ching performance by Drew
White, the Delt seniors are ob-
viously one of the most ex-
perienced teams in the league
in CA and Buck’s eyes.

F&M #1 has won four straight
since losing their opener to the
Cannoneers. Last week they
crushed the Errors 114 as
Harold Bailey split his pants in a
winning cause. Nice job Harold.

The world famous wimps of
W-1 are running on a softball
rampage. Their record stands
at an astounding, highly respec-
table 5-1. Last week they played
a fine game of ball in defeating
hapless C-1 (they showed folks),
4-1. Their defense and an out-
standing ‘“‘esprit de wimps”
have made the wimps what they
are today, wimpiest of wimps.

The PDG boys also played
another game Wednesday. In
the second game of their twi-

night doubleheader, the Gamms
made it a sweep by nipping
the PKA's 11-9. The Gamms are
now 4-1 in second place of the C

League.

Monday saw some exciting
contests one of which was a big
showdown. between the power-
ful Pope and His Court and the
mighty Kirkwood Derbies. The
Derbies defeated the Pope 11-9
as Mike Deese poked a key two
run double in a six run seventh
for the winners.

The Derbies used the short
right field woods on field #4 to
their advantage and this
seemed to be the turning point
as the Pope could not get his
bats working.

The San Juan Banana had a
bad day in the field as he could
not comprehend the Moultrie
Mad Dog's use of the English
lauguage on relay throws from
the outfield. When asked to

ing the Banana had this to say:

““La de da da da A-mer-i-ca!
Ariba!’’ Actually he didn’t say
anything cause he don’t know
no English.

The improving Errors clip-
ped the Cannoneers 10-4 as Rich
‘“‘Papa’’ Wilson knocked a bases
loaded triple to lead the way.

Watts 1 won two more games
Monday as they wimped a for-
feit out of the Lakers before
knocking off S-1 behind the
sparkling play of seldom seen
Jamie ‘‘Ace’’  Koloditch,
brought up from the minor
league team in Greenwich
Village. Kolodo handled six
fielding chances cleanly, ac-
tually showing vestiges of
athletic prowess.

Oh yes, the Cannon basement
boys then won a forfeit from S-1.
Obviously S-1 was too shaken by

of Cornelius

Ace Kolodo. Amazing how a
single player can destroy an en-
tire team.

F&M #1 continued their climb
to the top as they toppled SAE
15-7 behind 12 runs in the first
four innings. F&M is now 4-1.

SAE then dropped its second
game in a row as they lost to
powerful Dr. Pepper 7-5 on Tom
Tornee’s bases loaded grannie
in the seventh. The Peppers can
play with anybody when they
want to.

League A has the idle SIF’s at

4-0, and F&M #1 at 4-1. League B
is the biggest struggle as
Emanon is 3-0 while the Pope,
Wimps, and PDT seniors are all
at 5-1.

League C has S-3 at 5-0 and
Qand 12, the only team com-
prised totally of switch hitters,
at 4-0. PGD is 4-1 while the KA’s
are there too at 3-1.
