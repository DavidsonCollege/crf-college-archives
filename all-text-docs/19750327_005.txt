THRUST- Herbie Hancock
GET DOWN. WITH IT- Miles
Davis.
MYSTERIOUS TRAVELLER-
Weather Report — :

These three albums typify
the eclecticism of modern jazz.
Many of the musicians on these
records have played in the
various bands of Miles Davis,
and with other musicians. And
in the cases of these most
recent releases of these very
popular jazz groups, the
teacher takes a back seat to his
pupils. ...

With Thrust, Herbie Hancock
has put out another record that
can compete with the rock and
soul market. Head Hunters, his
earlier success, established
Hancock as one of the top
musicians reaching large
audiences with jazz.

able soul-rock rhythms. Han-
cock is not as showy with his

armada of electric keyboard in-

struments as on Head Hunters,
and the album benefits from
this fact.

The’ strongest performance
on the record comes from Ben-
nie Maupin: on the saxaphone.
He is featured in several solos,
where he accomplishes a
masterful blend = of post-
Coltrane technique while
keeping in line with Hancock’s
soul beat.

Hancock himself has learned
to. use the electric instruments

more lyrically, no longer using
the record for a show-piece of
his ability to change dials. But
at times the record still sounds
like an exhibition of bloops,
whines and burps.

Side one of the record is the
stronger, featuring Maupin on
long solos in Spank-a-Lee and
Butterfly. Hancock’s keyboards
furnish rhythm and texture
but little melodic line. He does
not blend acoustic with electric
piano like Chick Corea has

done. When he played in the old-

Miles Davis band Hancock

acoustic piano. His talent in
this field has been abandoned,
at least teniporarily, to other
fine. musicians like Corea and
McCoy Tyner.

Joe -Zawinul, founder and
keyboardist for Weather
Report, also rose’ to fame
through the ranks of the Miles
Davis career. Zawinul and
saxophonist Wayne Shorter
both played on Davis’. album
Bitches Brew, one of the first of
the experimental jazz records.

Weather Report’s latest
album, Mysterious Traveller,
redirects the ,avante garde
back to rock oriented sounds.
And does it very successfully.
Nubian Sundance and the title
song use atonality and multiple
rhythms: along with an
overiding continuity of beat to
make these songs danceable
while avoiding triteness.

This album uses the _in-
dividual textures of each in-
strument better than Hancock.

. Blackthorn Rose blends the

solo beauty of Shorter’s sax
with Zawinul on acoustic piano
to produce a ‘softness hard to
find in most of the new jazz.

As in Thrust, Weather
has combined the solo:
characteristic of jazz ' the
ensemble performance of rock.

Miles Davis needs to learn
from those he has taught in the
past. His new album carries the
atonality and arhythm of Bit-
ches Brew to its absurd end.
Most of the record lacks any
type of continuity for the
listener to grasp.

One song on the double
album, Honkey Tonk, sets up a
background beat with the
guitar, forming a basis for
Miles’ threadlike trumpet solo.
But the rest of the songs on
the record are not so suc-
cessful.

Miles plays the organ on this
album as well, but exhibits lit-
tle talent at this instrument.
Songs like He Loved Him Madly
consist of nothing more than
two or three chords sustained
for minutes at a time.

The unfortunate thing about
this record is that Davis plays
the trumpet very seldom. And
when he does the sound is only
an anemic echo of the horn on
Bitches Brew.

Herbie Hancock plays on this
album, as does Keith Jarrett
and John MacLaughlin. The
massing of such talents
destroys their individual skills
in this instance. Miles needs to
learn from his pupils and get

_ In the Christopher Miles film of
Jean Genet’s brilliant poetic one-act
play ‘‘The Maids” ‘some things are
clearly labeled reality-the scenes in-
volving Monsieur and the actions of the
maids, Solange and Claire, when they
are down from their fantasy pereches—
and others are clearly labled fantasy
or sham--Solange and Claire’s
ceremonies and Vivian Mer-
chant’s Madame.

Miles and his collaborators lend
their romantic approval to the fantasy
scenes and say to hell with the reality.

In casting actresses rather than
actors as the maids and interpreting
the “‘sisters’’ as lesbians rather than
as male lovers, Miles—and Minos
Volanskis, who directed the stage
production from which the film
derives-subordinate Genet’s appear-
ance -reality theme in favor of his
statements on maid and mistress love
and hate and good and evil.

I dare say these are enough themes
to keep any mortal play on its feet.
“The Maids,’- like some of
Shakespeare’s plays, is strong enough
to sustain many different in-
terpretations, and the Miles-Volakis
interpretation fits over it with a
minimum of chafing.

Genet’s understanding of the mail
homosexual psyche seems less
profound when applied to,the female’
homosexual psyche, but male roles
can be very exciting for the females.

“ ‘Think of Martha in ‘“‘Who's Afraid of

Virginia Woolf?’’ pale

Genet’s statement in reality-tiat it
isn’t really all that real--is no weak
thing in need of being hidden away ina
closet, but with Glenda Jackson in the

cast the play more than gains in
aesthetic conviction what it loses in
existentialism.

“The Maids” provides the occasion
for Jackson’s second great screen per-
formance. Like the first, her Nina in
Ken Russe’s ‘‘The Music Lovers,” her
Solange is an uneven accomplishment.

It starts off disgracefully as Jackson
indulges in an orgy of horribly .un-
controlled overacting, twisting her
face like a gargoyle and popping her
eyes.

At the beginning of the film she is
bearable only when her character has’
been knocked down from its fantasy
perch or when it is shading back and
forth on borderlines between fantasy
and reality.

She is very impressive in these more
restrained moments, dramatically
evoking,sometimes without any
dialogue, a characterization of a
woman whose soul has festered long
ago. One understands how Solange has
spent her life up until the time span of
the film, what she does between the
moments when we see her, what will
come of her later, that she seldom goes
outside, that she couldn’t care less for
children, that she is a lesbian, that she
masturbates a great deal, that her
faverite emotions are lust, envy and
spite.

One feels almost as though one knew
what she atefor supper atnight’

Jackson’s Solange is like a tragic
characterization stepped whole from
the pages of Faulkner. One shot of her

face, as she holds it in this film, is

enough tospeakatome. .
She plays the devil, the quin-
tessence of evil, yet she manages in the

‘The Maids’
Miles mixes reality, sham

scenes labeled. reality to ring a
touching vulnerablility to the role.
During the long monologue at the end,
when Solange is swept up in her fan-
tasies moré strongly than before and
-triumphantly exults in being what she
is not, Jackson’s ‘performance attains
true greatness.

Her performance is like a fluid, un-
derstated ballet in which the
movements of her body are ac-
companied by the cannonade of her
voice and the two work together to
suggest vast depths of emotion.

There are maleness, magic, demon-
ic possession and the Devil in her deli-
very and not a trace of the gargoyle.

Jackson is a great formalist but her
form in this scene is subdued to her
content. It is the content that sweeps
her performance along, as it was
dominantly the content that swept

Jason Robards through his long ©

monologue in ‘‘A Moon for the
Misbeggotten’’-the only instance I can
recall of a monologue delivered as well
as this one.

Jackson’s performance did to me
what all great art -- whether

_ melodramatic, serious or comic—does

to me when it is also greatly affective
(some great art is just plain boring,
but that is another matter).

Her performance made me cry. As
I left the theater afterwards, I was still
gasping for breath and swallowing
down sobs.

Jackson’s Solange does not have the

opportunity to interact with a major

mise-en-scene, as her Nina did,but
Miles’ direction is fine and subtle if
rather weak.

He made the mistake of showing
Monsieur and the outside world of

Virgin ‘and the Gypsy.”

back in the vanguard.

Paris—both only alluded to in the play—-
and they come off seeming like parts
of another movie, albeit an intriguing
one.

Like Mile’s “The Virgin and the
Gypsy,” “‘The Maids’”’ is lusciously ap-
pointed. The former movie, along with
Losey’s ‘‘The Go-Between’’ and:
Russel’s “‘Women in Love” and ‘‘The
Music. Lovers’’, is one of the
most beautiful expressions there are
of that quality in film which is unique-
ly British. :

Miles has lost the-quality in ‘‘The
Maids” and finds no adequate sub-
stitute—his direction is often no more
than a fechnical exercise—but he still
has a vibrant sense of color.

His interweaving of pastel, velvet
