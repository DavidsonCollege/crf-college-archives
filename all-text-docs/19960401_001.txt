Sophomore
dorms will

receive face-lift.

Rooms down the hill may have
cable, ethernet access in each room

While most students
will be sitting out in the sun,
traveling, or trying to make
a few bucks this summer,
major renovations will be
taking place in Knox, Irwin
and Akers dormitories.

Built in the mid 1970s,
the sophomore dorms were
designed to last only 20 or
25 years before needing
renovation. Unfortunately,
when the dorms were built,
long term use and efficiency
were not considered.

Director of Residence

Life Kurt Holmes outlined
the areas that students will
find more visible. “The
dorms will be re-carpeted
and re-painted this summer,”
Holmes says.

The dorms will also

‘undergo some structural

changes. Three rooms on
each floor are being turned
into what Holmes termed
“natural singles.” During
this process, these singles
will be made slightly smaller
in order to accommodate
built in closets in the double
rooms.

The upstairs lounge in
each of the buildings is also

being converted into two
double rooms. Holmes says,
“There just wasn’t a need to
have two lounges in each
building.”

Possibly the biggest
change affecting the dorms
is the wiring for cable and
ethernet. Each room will
have a cable and an ethernet
outlet. However, Holmes
says, “We are not sure that
the actual outlets will be
hooked up. It is a good prob-
ability that each room will

have these outlets, but that
they will be non-functional
next year. Until Trellis
Communications gets back
tous, we don’t know exactly
what will happen.”

The plans are also call-
ing for an added front porch
on each of the dorms which
would provide for covered
bike racks. Additional
changes include changing
the hot water system to gas
and replacing the existing
heating and cooling system

so that each room has an
individual thermostat. ‘In
the past, students have com-
plained about the climate
control system, so we are
trying to fix that,” Holmes
says.

In the process of fixing
the climate control systems,
an additional closet will have
to be made, and will result in
the loss of one toilet in each
of the bathrooms. Holmes

As committees meet
and higher- ups discuss al-
cohol issues, the campus
continues to wonder what
will happen if the ban on
kegs (proposed by the self-

_Study) is approved.

Several committees. of
students, faculty, and staff
exist to talk about the issue
at hand: will the campus go
BYOB, and if so, then how
will it work?

Faculty
vote on
minors
Tuesday

By KirsTEN RECKNAGEL

As the clock runs down on
Davidson’s latest academic issue —
the institution of minors — the
Council on Academic Affairs is
planning a campus-wide push for

awareness of minors’ last hurdle, °

the faculty vote. This vote, in which
all faculty will take part, is sched-
uled to be held this Tuesday.

Junior Liz Abernathy, Presi-
dent of the Council on Academic
Affairs, says, “If minors don’t pass,
it should be a while before our
committtee pursues them again
unless there is just overwhelming
student support forthem. But we’ re
trying to be positive and hope that
they pass.”

As of last week, the Council
on Academic Affairs had collected
almost 600 student signatures in
support of minors.

Even passage of the resolu-
tion. will not ensure that minors

According to aDavidsonian
telepoll, 69% of surveyed stu-
dents are not happy with the state
of gender relations on campus.
The poll was conducted by call-
ing a random sampling of 88 stu-
dents,

women’s issues for the Self Study

came a priority recommendation,
stating, “The campus should work
to promote an atmosphere that does
not promote the disparagement of
women.”

This semester has been no
exception to the debate. As seen by
the controversy surrounding
Patterson Court’s events from
“Hook Night,” “Ladies Night,” and
the proposed “Pimp and Ho” party
on Patterson Court, Davidson
males and females do not always
seem to be communicating on the
same wavelength.

Sophomore Vinod Thomas
says, “It seems that every semester
one of the biggest controversies
has to do with gender relations.”

Kappa Sigma President David
Wick says he does "not believe the

im...

problem is as big as itis made up to
be.” But, he also agrees, “The
school should provide moe op-
portunities to interact besides
Patterson Court.”

One poll respondent said,
“Even though I have no personal
problems [with the state of gender
relations], the atmosphere just
seems to be negative.” That theme
was echoed throughout the ‘poll-
ing.

As the numbers and recent
campus debate indicate, problems
between genders at Davidson will
not be easily resolved.

Even the Self Study is unchar-
acteristically vague on the how to

solve the problem. It does say that

“other areas of interaction between:
the sexes should exist other than
Patterson Court.” But, it does not
offer any specifics, besides pos-
sible events in the new Union, as to

how that can be possibly achieved

in the near future.

That does not mean answers
to helping the situation are not
available.

One possible solution, sug-
gested by self study coordinators,
could be sessions to promote “sen-
sitivity” between males and fe-
males. These efforts. would take
place during the freshman year. It
is hoped it will provide an alternate

guys to meet other than hall mix-
ers or the Court.

The designers of such meet-
ings do not want the sessions to
always deal with gender rela-
tions. Instead, they would sim-
ply provide a non-academic and
non-social forum to discuss any-
thing. .

Dean of Students Tom
Shandley says, “I would not use
the phrase ‘sensitivity training’,”
but does hope that “some aspects
of the program could be phased
into PE 101.”

Another group of students
are taking a more direct approach
tothe problem. Freshman Jordan
deBree is part of an effort to
establish a.coed eating house.
Davidson has had sucha house in
the past, but it fell apart in the
early 80s..

deBree says, “The house
would serve as an excellent way
for Patterson Court to bring girls
and guys together instead of drive
them apart. The Court is the one
thing that all Davidson students
can participate in and that is
unique to Davidson. However, it
seems as if most gender prob-
lems originate from the Court.
Our House will try to fix that.”
