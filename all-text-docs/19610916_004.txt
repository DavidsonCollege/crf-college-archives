Joins Union Desk Staff

By RICK VON UNWERTH
Davidsonian Feature Editor

The staff of the David Ovens
Student Union has made a rath-
er unique, though undeniably
valuable, addition to its staff.

« A bright yellow female squir-
rel monkey now occupies a

Position of state on the Union |

information desk. Her primary
function is, allegedly, to handle
the majority of student ques-
ions. Only the most difficult will
find their way to Mrs. Carol
Cooke.

The monkey was originally
rented to act as an organ-grind-
er’s flunky. She indicated how-
ever that this was beneath dig-
nity by snapping at the fingers
of several of her detractors.

C. Shaw Smith and the com-
mitteemen of the Union have
recently voted to retain the ma-
lodorous monster as mascot.
The Union employees agree
that “She has gotten more at-
tention than any other single
display we've had so far.”

The monkey, so far, has sus-
tained herself admirably on a
diet of Purina Monkey Chow,
interspersed with cigarette filt-
ers, jaw flies, lettuce, finger-
Mails, and a pencil eraser spot-
ted here and there for spice.

When the animal was  ap-
proached by the DAVID-

SONIAN, she was resting in
relative comfort atop her house
‘with one finger in her ear and
the other fondling her __ tail.
Throughout the interview,
the monkey remained exasper-
atingly aloof, changing her posi-
tion only occasionally to scratch
her nether regions.

No’ plans have been an-
nounced for the monkey after
the termination of her mascot-
ship. She will take temporary
lodging in the psychology labo-
ratory, and it is rumored that
She-will participate in some be-
havior experiments later this
year.

Parking Lots,
Buildings Appear

The Fine Arts Building, park-
ing areas, and faculty housing
were three areas in which work
was done to improve Davidson's
physical facilities this summer.

Yesterday a final inspection
of the building was planned to
be carried out by Mr. Currie,
Mr. Meetze, and Dr. Martin with
the contractors. Since all the
equipment for the building will
not arrive until after the 15th, it
will not be fully completed un-
til then. The sound and stage
equipment is now in the pro-
cess of being installed and
permanent seating in the audi-
torium will be put in starting
Monday. .

New parking lots were put in
and are being worked on across
from the Pi Kappa Phi house,
around and across from the Fine

Arts Building, and at the north
1end of Chambers. Also the road
opposite the Sigma Chi house
was widened. This road leads
‘to a parking lot for the new
golf range to be opened later
this month. .

Scott Announces New
PE Program Requirements

A new change in requirements of the Davidson Col:
lege physical education program exempting same 30 jun-
iors and seniors from extended participation in the pro-
gram was passed unanimously last Friday by the David-

son Faculty.

Dr. Tom Scott, athletic direc-
tor, requested the change “to
try to get the boys out by the
end of their sophomore year”
and Dean of the Faculty Frontis
W. Johnston recommended it at
Friday’s meeting.

Another provision passed by
the Faculty expands the quar-
ter-long fundamentals classes
for freshmen who fail to pass
the physical test to run the en-
tire first semester.

“It seems,” said Dr. Scott,
“that there has been a trend
recently to let those boys go
when they fail the swimming
and fundamentals tests repeat-
edly. They become disinteres-
ted in the work and tend to
overcut,”

PURPOSE

The changes are intended “to
help the fundamentals student a
little and let juniors and seniors
use that extra hour to study.”
However, if a physical education
student overcuts his classes, he
still is required to attend an
extra semester.

Dr. Scott said about 25 juniors
and two or three seniors are

excused from physical educa-
tion this year under the change.

Heretofore, a portion of the
fundamentals requirement
swimming — has been pursued
one day a week. A change last
year extends swimming practice
to three days a week.

OLD PROGRAM

—_—

Physical education at David-
son is a two-year requirement.
Until last week a student who
failed to fulfill the requirement
by the end of his sophomore
year was forced to attend classes
through his junior and senior
years, if necessary.

The previous rule establishing
the length. of fundamentals
training had been in effect for
six years.

Upon their arrival on campus,
freshmen undergo tests to de
termine their skills in several
fundamental athletic exercises
softball throw, obstacle
sprint, 100-yd. dash, football
kick and’ bar snaps, among
others — and those who fail
to accumulate the required
number of points must retake
the tests until they pass.

Some students never manage
to pass. The new change is di-
rected to their advantage.
