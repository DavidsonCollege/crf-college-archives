unfortunate incidents of in-
dividuals whose response to job
security is a slothful apathy is
anybody’s guess. But do the ad-
vantages outweigh this disad-
vantage?

The advantage of tenure as
recognized by the faculty is that
it provides for freedom of ex-
pression — social, political, and
economic--by _ professors
without fear of reprisal by
higher authorities.

Yet like Jacob laboring in the
wilderness those seven long
years for his bride, facult

members must earn their right
to speak and contribute. to the
effectiveness of this church-
related college.

Is it wise to ask that creative

thought be denied expression
for that large a part of one’s

career if such creativity con-
flicts with accepted in-
terpretations of exactly what a
“church-related college’ is?

Returning to the college’s
statement of purpose, it says
that in the selection of teachers,
the college ‘‘seeks men and
women of genuine spirituality.’’

The question then becomes
one of definition of that
spirituality.

From my perspective it is
hoped that the college will
forever encourage its
professors to speak out, and to
take seriously that portion of
the statement of purpose which.
asserts that. ‘‘Davidson is

Davidson must never allow it-
self t6 maintain a staff of
Christians of ‘‘spiritual charac-
ter,”’ who constantly defend
the status quo in the interest of
obtaining tenure.

Author James G. Branscome
says of such ‘colleges that,

Cub Critic Blasts
Trite Water Works

By VINCE RABIL
Contributing Editor

There comes a time in the life.

of every young art reviewer
when he or she is given the
golden opportunity to blast the
hell out of what one may call
downright bad art.

However, I question whether
or not this show (or whatever)
of watercolors by Ward Jackson
may even be considered art and
thus be categorically associated
with real art.

Jackson mentions in the
prospectus that these works are
a release from his ‘more
austere paintings done in the
winter months. in New York.”’ I

agree.

as I can tell, just a release. I
think I wish we could see those
“more austere paintings’ from
New York so that we here at
Davidson could more fully ap-
preciate Jackson’s release.

I hate to actually deal with
the works themselves, but if I
must say something, then let
me say that at least Jackson’s
work is consistent--consistently
trite, consistently the ‘same
size, consistently poor in han-
dling of the medium, and con-
sistently uninteresting.

If you would like to miss one
of the shows in this year’s
Davidson Exhibitions, then
seriously consider avoiding
Cunningham Fine Arts Building °
yntil February 20. That should
be long enough to miss this one.
