replaced by the 11:20-11:50 time

classes.

The motion Laura Cunning-
ham made last week to start a
Public Policy Committee was
passed this week. The commit-

“smoothly, but according to Kristi

Kessler the whole concept is going
to be reevaluated over the summer.
Research will be done on how
other colleges organize their re-
cruiting weekends, as well as how
effective the weekend is in draw-
ing students to Davidson.
The Patterson Court renova-
tions are scheduled to begin in the
next two weeks. Plans have been
greatly scaled down, and the work
has been contracted out. Each house
is expected to take approximately
four to five weeks to finish. Work
on the new Martin Court apart-
ment buildings has begun, and itis
expected that two will be finished
by next fall. One of the buildings
will have a basement that will
contain drink machines, washers
-and dryers, and a large meeting
room.

Cammie Covington spoke to the
SGA as the new president about
her expectations for the year. She
expressed the need for enthusiasm
onthe partof both the SGA and the

-. entire student body, not just at .

parties. or athletic events, but ip

- ham personally about their per-

everything. She éncouraged
people to get involved, and to
speak to her and Laura Cunning-

formance if anyone has any ques-
tions or comments.
‘Cammie then described the new
SGA/Punch Line card that will
be available around campus. Itis
a long fold-up card with ads and
discounts on one side and perti-
nent questions and information
about alcohol and alcoholism on
the other.

The final order of new busi-
ness was to approve a number of
appointments. Grey Timberlake
was approved as the new Chan-
cellor. The other appointments
were Mike Moriarty as Elections

Women's Issues Committee
Sponsors Feminist Forum

By Frances Morton

In celebration of National
Women’s History Month, the
Committe for Women’s Issues
sponsored many events in the Un-
ion last week, including a self-
assertiveness workshop with Missy
Kuykendall, and a discussion On
Women and Nutrition with Sue
Reade, the College Dietician. But
the activity which undoubtedly
gained the most interest on cam-
pus was a forum entitled “What it
Means to be a Feminist.”

Attended by a healthy amount of
both male and female students, as
well as several members of the
Davidson Community, the purpose
of this meeting was to raise con-
sciousness of what it really means
to be a feminist, and its implica-
tions for everyday life.

The forum began with an intro-
duction by Dr: Rosemary Tong,
whoteaches Introduction to Femi-
nist Thoughtat the college, and has
written several books on the sub-
ject. Tong asserted that the ulti-
mate belief ofall feminists is “the
conviction that the subordination
of women is wrong.” Their goals
are to articulate moral criticism,
come up with morally desirable
alternatives, and live with family
and friends in the best: possible
way while pursuing other feminist
goals.

Tong discussed the negative
image that .most people have of
feminists’ -- pictures of women
crusaders in the ‘60’s bumming bras
and storming the Miss America
pageant in protest. She assured the
audience that there are as many
types of feminists as there are any
types of human beings.

Types range from liberal femi-

nists, who are basically content

“with the structure of the society we

live in but simply want equal op-
portunity for women in the work
force, to post-modern feminists
who are worried that feminists of
today are falling into the trap of all
that they are against.

By declaring prerogatives for all
women, many feminists fail totake
into consideration inherent differ-
ences in women from different
cultures and backgrounds, thereby
becoming just as oppressive as the
males -who attempt to define
women in their own constrictive
views.

Other members of the panel in-
cluded Gilbert Shaw, a senior his-
tory major; Don Kimmel, profes-
sor of Biology; and Tania Tam-

. biah,an international student from

Sri Lanka.

The most potent issues raised
were why it is so offensive to de-
clare yourself a feminist, and the
idea of how far to goin standing up
for your beliefs.

Many people in the audience were
concerned with the stigma attached

to the concept of feminism. “Why
do people bristle when you happen
to mention that you are a femi-
nist?” asked one participant.

The panel’s answer was that
certain strategies employed by
some of the more radical feminists
to draw attention to the abuse of
women... .led: less. enlightened
members of society to misinterpret
all feminists as brutes who do not
care about their appearance and
would leave their families.

Because of this unfortunate mis-
conception, even famous authors
such as Margaret Atwood, who
visited the campus lastmonth, hesi-

tates to label her books as
“women’s literature” because it
would limit the number of people
reading her books.

A possible solution suggested
by a member of the audience was
toknow when to stop trying tocon-
vince people to subscribe to the
feminist philosophy. “Noone likes
a zealot,” he commented. “These
people may be feminists, but they
are also many other things.”

On the other side of the coin, it
was pointed out that a certain
amount of risk-taking and activ-
ism must be involved in the femi-
nist movement. Persuasion is good,
but it takes a long time and often
fails. The key for feminists is to
have patience.

Finally, discussion turned to the
situation at Davidson itself, Dr.
Kimmel expressed regret that not
more students were willing to talk
about feminism and other explo-
sive movements in his classes --
“It’s just not as fun to teach any-
more,” he said. The atmosphere at
the school seems to lead people to
be afraid of being different; no one
wants to be too confrontational.

Gilbert Shaw summed up the fu-
ture of feminism at Davidson with

his coment that it would be “de-

pendent on what the students
demand.” —

Ellen Crawford, a senior who at-
tended the forum, was pleased with
the outcome of the discussions and
believed the forum served its pur-
pose by “getting people talking.”
She believed it was successful in
“dispelling the bad connotations
of being a feminist. After all, it is
notan offensive thing, just women
wanting equal treatment as any
other human being would want.”

SGA co-sponsors Dis-
count/Drug and Alcohol
Awareness Cards

By Sean Lind

Punch Line Publications, in
association with the Student
Government Association and area
“Merchants Who Care” is offer-
ing to all Davidson students a
discountcard designed to increase
student awareness of drug and
alcohol problems. —_-

On one side, the cards display
discounts and advertising infor-
mation from local businesses. On
the other is a ten-question alcohol
/drug abuse test, and phone num-
bers and hotlines for people with
abuse problems, as well as factual
information about drunk driving
fatalities. The facts represented
on the card were obtained from
the Governor’s Council on Alco-
holism.

The discount cards are valid
for all Davidson students for the
entire year,

A letter from the Dean of
Students Office to local area
merchants states “Our hope is to
provide through Operation Punch

tial number, the Program is cur-
rently only able to satisfy 20-25%
of bone marrow transplant need.

Participation at Davidson last
Wednesday was high. 472 people
gave samples to be typed.

Gigi Cooke, a member of the
Bone Marrow Committee, was

pleased by the tum-out. “Itsaysa
lot for Davidson College,” she

Lindsay said he was “thrilled
Davidson students have proved
that Davidson is not an apathetic
campus, but are willing to give so
that others may live.”

will be,used to communicate drug
and alcohol abuse facts. We will
distribute 2000 cards without cost:
to every member of the Davidson
community.

“The concept is. very: simple.
You, the merchant will provide the
buying incentive and enable the
users to stretch their money thereby
giving the card value. The student
using the card will see your alco-
hol/drug abuse fact many, many
times during the coming year.”

Gloria Clevinger, the corpo-
rate marketing director of Punch
Line, sees the cards as interactive.
She says, “I would urge the stu-
dents to participate with the mer-
chants who sponsor the program.”

Bill Stuckey, Punch Line’s
National Sales Manager, reinforces
this idea, adding that students are
encouraged to give feedback, both
on the quality and effectiveness of
the drug and alcohol abuse infor-
mation and on which merchants
students would prefer on the card.

Cammie Covington, SGA
President, said she “agreed to sup-
port the cards because they were a
practical and effective way tomake
the student body aware of alcohol
and drug abuse problems.” She
added that the SGA intends to work
with Punch Line in the future,
giving feedback about the cards
and offering suggestions for im-
provement.
