Forum Set For February 9

condemn concepts of world gov-,our reply to the Marxian analysis

Ed Stuart, chairman of the
YMCA Forum Committee, an-
nounced today that plans for a
February 0th campus-wide forum
are being completed, and prepara-
tions sre well underway. The
one-day forum entitled “Power
Politics and Moral Responsibility”
will include a chapel program, aft-
ernoon discussion groups and an
evening forum patterned on the
“Town Hall’ radio series,

Mr. Ernest Lefever, associate ex-
ecutive director of the National
Council of Churches’ Department
of International Justice and Good
Will, will advocate the position
that morality has a vital role to
play in international politics. Op-
posing him, Dr, Paul H. Clyde, his-
torian and expert on internation-
al relations from Duke, will argue
the “realistic” viewpoint that
“power politics” is the predomi-
nant factor in foreign policy and
fnternational affairs. Two well-
known Davidson professors will
serve as seconds to the principal
speakers.

Is the wisest approach to policy
and politics that of expediency, of
the “national interest,” that posi-
tion advocated by such “new-
realists” as Dr. Hans Morgenthau
and Mr. George Kennan, men who
recognize pure power as the only
valid instrument for negotiation
and the only guide to policy and
action? Although there are diverse
points of view within the general
framework of the “power-politics”
position, many of its exponents

The George Washington Univer-
sity Law School invites applica-
tions for seven scholarships, each
of which will provide a full three
years’ tuition.

Candidates must rank in the up-
per fifth of their class, and have
demonstrated qualities of leader-
ship. Successful candidates will be
required to maintain a “B” aver-
age each year as a condition of
retention of the scholarship.

ernment under international law,
or guidance in foreign policy by
some criterion of supra-national
morality as the dangerous and
idealistic confusions of sentimen-
policy to be guided by the realists,
talists and dreamers. Is national
istic” approach to the more valid,
or the so-called ‘“legalistic-moral-
perhaps ultimately the more prac-
tical, the more “wise”? This posi-
tion is that of Dr. Abraham Feller,
perhaps that of Mr. John Foster
Dulles, and certainly that of many
churchmen. Is it not the position
in which are anchored the princi-
ples of the United Nations and
similar organizations?

Is principle a factor as well as
power? Can there exist, in oppo-
sition to Hobbes, law and morality
outside and above the state? Can
there be a reconciliation between
what Dr. Morgenthau calls the
“Hamiltonian” and “Wilsonian”
approaches to foreign policy, the
latter condemning a policy based
exclusively on the national in-
terest as short-sighted if not im-
moral?

In the student discussions, of
course, the issues will be brought
to specifics, A survey is being
taken in the fraternities and other
campus organizations to determine
particular topics for discussion in
the Forum framework—for  ex-
ample: “Should Red China be ad-
mitted to the U.N.?” “Is coex-
istence: between Democracy and
Communism possible?” “What is

of Ceylon and the Free University
of Berlin are described, as well as
other awards administered by the

Europe, Asia, and Latin America

can students for the 1954-55 acad-
emic year. More detailed informa-
tion on these grants is available
from the offices of the Institute.

Earliest deadline for applications
is January 15 for the two awards
at the University of Ceylon and
for four awards offered for ad-
vanced study in Brazil. Closing
dates of other competitions are in
February, March, April, and May.

Perhaps it is true, as I said ear-
lier, that we, as realistic observers,
of life, are twenty years behind our
times. Still the impression pushes
us on that our school is two or
more steps behind us—still un-
realistic. and still uncomprehend.

attended other sessions of the Jef-, junior classes are eligible to ap-

ferson School in 1051 and 10952.
He said he has had no contacts

his return to the school, that
security measures were much
more strict, He sald the class-
rooms were checked before each
meeting, and the stairs to Wilker-
son’s office were barred; it could
be reached only by elevator.

Clontz said Communist Party

he carried, as identification, a re-
ceipt signed “J. Scales” dated
March 3, 1961, He said he carried
it in his wallet from that time
until last Friday when he gave it
to Ralph J, Edsell, Jr., counsel
for the Justice Department in the
pending case, The receipt was en-
tered as an exhibit,

ply for the program.
To Get In
To become a Naval Reservist
(requisite to applying for ROC), a
man must be between the ages
of 17 and 18% and not classified

Another officer program open
its case against the Jefferson
School.
Surprise
Clontz said he was born at Char-
lotte and has lived at Wilming-
ton and Whiteville, N.C. His
parents, the Rev. and Mrs. Ralph
Clayton Clontz, Sr., live at David-
son, N. C. Clontz said he attended
the Darlington school for boys at

tion to serve in Europe during
World War II, and finished his
course at Davidson in 1947.

to college graduates is the Officer
Candidate School also at Newport,
Rhode Island. Commander Micken
also has information on this for
interested college students.

A ROC is paid not only for the
period of training itself but also
for the period of travel to New-
port, and back to his hometown.
Meals are as well paid for by the
Navy during travel time. Pay is
at the rate of his rate in the Navy
unless the man is a Seaman Re-
cruit, the lowest Navy rate, in
which case he is temporarily
upped in rate one grade to Sea-
man Apprentice.

In order to apply for the ROC
Program, a student must not only
be physically qualified by the

(3) a Dental degree, or prepara-
tion therefor.

A ROC graduate is obligated to
serve on active duty with the Navy
for a period not to exceed three
years, though the actual time to
be served will depend on the needs
of the Navy.

The Draft

There are certain draft advan-
tages which being a member of
the Naval Reserve and especially
ROC program that will be of par-
ticular interest to college students.

While membership in the Naval
Reserve itself does not exempt
men from selective service nor
does application to ROC training,
acceptance in the ROC program
insures exemption from the draft
so long as he remains in the pro-
gram. One may become disenrolled
from the program for Naval
reasons, fof not remaining in good
standing with his college, or for
falling below the physical re-
quirements of the Training.
