Forum Plan
Is Realized

State-wide Interest Is
Created; To Be At 5:35
Sunday Over WBT

Sunday night from 5:35 to 6:00
P. M., over station WBT, the De-
partment of World Evangelism, of
the Davidson College Y. M. C. A
will present an Intercollegiate Radio
Forum on the “Essential Elements
of A Just and Durable Peace.”

This forum will be of state-wide
interest because of the delegates at-
tending. ~The -Eniversity of North
Carolina will be represented on the
program by L. P. McClendon. From
Wake College will come
Bedford Black, and Hans Frei will

be

Forest

the, delegate from North Caro-
lina State College. Edward Hughes
will represent Centre College. The
local Studgnt body president, Al-
bert Winn, will represent Davidson.

Discuss World Ideas —

This forum is another step taken
by the collegiate youth of America
to show their interest and knowl-
edge concerning the relation of the
United States to the social and re-
ligious state of the world as a whole.

“It is hoped,” says Shaw Smith,
“that the supporg, which we have re-
ceived from these delegates will
make possible a stimulating series
of forums.”

Priestley
rector,

Conyers, program di-
the Spirit of the
Forum when he says, “We-Ameri-
cans must come to realize that the
winning of the war is not an end
in itself. It is a means to an end:
the establishment of a more just
and durable world order. So long
as we regard the winning of the
war as an end in itself there is little
hope for the peace.”

Arrangemente

This program has been arranged
through the close co-operation of
the Y. M.°C. A., the officials of
station WBT, and the college ad-
ministration.

From Monroe Bush, Y. M. C. A.
member and of the
program, the following statement is
given. “This effort arises from both
the Memphis Convention and the
C. P. U.-I. S. S. Conference which
was held at Chapel Hill last month.

By JOHN SHERRILL

hereby announced.
“The freshmen are improving

tween the three upperclasses and
the aforesaid group.

“As was said previously, those
men who were mentioned ‘in last
week's issue of The Davidsonian

will be placed on campus as soon
as snow is evaporated along with
“a corps of-others-and it will -be-ad-
visable for all first year men to
strictly adhere to the regulations
if embarassment is not desired.

“Arrangements have been made
with the program committee of
chapel to permit the culprits to do

Body.”
