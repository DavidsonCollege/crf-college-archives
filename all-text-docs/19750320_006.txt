Somehow the word ‘“‘pub’’
conjures visions of the revelry
of the English setting where ale
is king and the game is darts.
That’s hardly the case at this

Lured partly by its name, not
to mention its. advertised
specials (pizza and London
broil), we decided to pay our
regards the Saturday: night of

nually.

Another one of those Charlot-
te hot-spots (like the Rheinland
Haus) hidden in the enclosures
of a shopping mall, Ye Old Pub
projected a rather pleasing at-
mosphere to our senses upon
our entrance into its confines.
_.Ht‘had- none of the riotous
qualities of your run-of-the-mill
tavern, but rather a more

relaxed setting congenial to a
different type ot patron.

The latter seemed to be com-
posed mostly of a genteel-
looking second generation
crowd of former college
classmates; many with the ap-

pearance of having been frat-
oriented jocks. (How’s that for
a descriptive label?) We were
immediately impressed and
comforted by the appearance of
a sea of pro and college pen-
nants adorning the walls, which
indicated that this was ob-
viously a class joint.

Our pre-meal time was spent
trying to illumine the identity of
as many of these pennants as
possible. Impressed by the
quantity displayed, we were
dismayed to find none bearing
the colors of our beloved alma
mater, Davidson.

How could they ignore the
presence, in their own county

Ye Ole Pub Lacks Pennant

even, of the Princeton of the
South with its hallowed halls of
learning and ivy-draped walk-
ways, not to mention its athletic
prowess?

Our passivity overcoming our
pride (an act of pure sin), we
soon forgave this tragic over-
sight, at least until we went to
pay our bill and discovered
hanging over the cash register a
plaque bearing the inscription
UNC-C displayed in all its
shameful nakedness for the
world to see.

Oh, how quickly they forget!
Sure I realize that everybody
likes a winner, but one season
hardly negates a tradition.

A few words finally about the
food. The voracious appetites of
the conitgent members had in-
duced all of us to order the Lon-
don broil priced at $3.95 for the
complete dinner. We didn’t
have to wait long to be served,
an interim marked by con-
versation with our hospitable
waitress.

She sought to abate our anger
by explaining that all _the
athletic momentos were gifts of
customers and _ did _ not
represent the views of the
management.

This raised the challenging
problem: don’t Davidson
students patronize Ye Old Pub,
or are they embarrassed to ad-
mit their affiliation?

It sounded an awful lot to us
like a hint for.a pennant, which
we assured her would be
forthcoming on our next visit.
The London broil, incidentally,
was well worth the wait, ex-
ceeding -our expectations in
every regard.

German fried potatoes (try
them). plus salad, bread
basket, and tea came complete
with the meal. We left fully
satisfied, and determined to

pay a return visit to sample the
pizza.

NEXT WEEK- Sir George and
the Dragon

Lilian Cavani is evidently an admirer
on Luchino Visconti’s dreadfully un-

| pleasant masterpiece ‘‘The Damned.”’
Her “The Night Porter’? stars Dirk

Bogarde and Charlotte rampling and is

| costumed by Pieto Losi, all of whom did

| much more telling work for the Visconti
film.

I Like “The Damned,” “The Night Por-
ter’’ is an Italian fantasy at the expense

See a a Ee

yo Nazi Germany. Whether the Nazis:

were heterosexual or homosexual or both
or neither is often unclear, but that they
j were very decorative can hardly be
doubted.
A “The Night Porter’’ does not have a

] man dressed 48 a- woman, which I sup-_

i] pose is the next best thing.
Cavani has a light delicate touch for
i the cinema keyboard; where ‘‘The Dam-
j ned’? was Wagnerian, ‘‘The Night Por-
ter’’ is Mozartian, only glacial, not-so
alive a Mozart can be.
i The screenplay, a magnificently silly
J one by Cavani and Italo Moscati, is
b played solemnly instead of for comedy or
dramatic impact. Cavani cannot be ac-
: cused of romanticism or pandering or
J sensationalism or anything else much
worth accusing her of.
| Her understated mise-en-scene doesn’t
seem an ideal one for her subject matter,
_the tale of a sadomasochistic love affair

between a Nazi officer and a Jewish
prisoner which is renewed years later
when the Jewess blunders into a hotel
which houses a group of eccentric,
decaying Nazis-among them her old
lover.

The film is photographed in somber
tones, and one or two scenes are badly
acted in a heavy-breathing manner, but
otherwise all traces of melodrama are
carefully eschewed. Losi’s great sense of
the dramatic is not utilized; his costumes
are the most realistic I have seen by
him. fal:

If ‘The Nignt Porter’’ were ex-
travagant, then at least it might manage
to avoid creating the impression that
Cavani had purposely set out to make a
boring film. Self-consciously elegant
fims have a tendency to be unsuccessful--
that is, not involving—-and Cavani’s a
fairly mediocre attempt, is no excep-
tion. Cavani had good taste, some
understanding of what film is all about
and a mild degree of talent; she lacks
imagination and pity for her audience.

Dance scenes can be taken as the
ultimate trials of most directors’
abilities.

Instead of seeking dramatic equival-
ents of ballet, dance steps which would
seem to be ballet, she contents herself
with recording literal ballet movements.

; reel to reel
‘The Night Porter’

Cavani Produces Nazi Fantasies

Rampling’s Dietrich-like chanteuse
number give expression neither to the
characterization she is attempting nor to
any sort of acting technique, and this is
exactly the type of scene that a director
who was worth much ought to be able to
guide a star through even if she couldn’t
act. ~

Cavani’s instincts in casting Rampling
must be held extremely suspect. Ram-
pling does not so much play a fixated
person as give a childish performance.
There are a few moments when she is
photographed and costumed so well that
she seems about to break out into acting,
but these moments are illusory and
quickly shattered.

To cast Bogarde as a sexually neurotic
introvert should have been out of the
question. The first couple of tries an ac-
tor is type-cast can be eaciting both for
him and his audience. Later, however,

he begins to suffocate if he isn’t allowed -

enough variety.

. Bogarde, as Max, the night porter,
executes tightly controlled poses and
mannerisms that he seems to have
memorized by now. As of three years
ago, with Visconti’s ‘Death in Venice,”
Bogarde was still an accomplished actor,
but he has little chance+to show his
powers here. It’s as though acting were
not what he were called on to do.

Except for a couple of inspired line
deliveries, his performance is worthless.

There’s a lot of bad supporting acting in |
the film, too. |

Cavani’s only genuine talent seems to
be her responsiveness to physical tex- |
tures. Alfio Contini’s cinematography, |
Osvaldo Desideri’s sets and Losi’s |
costumes are all memorable and seem
perfectly under the director’s control. |

One imagines there must have been an |
exciting give and take between the direc- i
tor and these men. She has managed to
fit their work into her overall design i
(such as itis) without stifling them... I

While Loc‘’s great talent is not for what
he does here, his work is still very fine
and sensitive. Contini doesn’t find the
right shade for the men’s faces; other- |
wise his photography is consummate.

During the last half-hour of ‘“‘The Night i
Porter,’ the lovers slowly, lyrically
Starve to death in an apartment sur- |
roundedby one or two Nazis. Cavani has |
no interest in entertaining her audience,
which may be a kind of integrity. though
I doubt it. I respect her intellectually 1
rather than emotionally, which isa dam- |

ning thing to say about any dealer in the |
ants; Dara
