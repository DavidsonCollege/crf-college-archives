Ministerial Band

The Ministerial Band meeting on Sun-

day, November 8th, opened with a song

service led by Clancy Williams. .Presi-
dent C. Y. Bowie conducted the program.
Prayers were offered by different mem-
bers of the band.

Dr. J. M. McConnell spoke on the “In-
spirational Value of a Great Life.” His
scripture reading was taken from I Peter
EXPY,
siprational value of the lives of such
great leaders as George Washington,
Dwight L. Moody, Gladstone, Pitt and
Pasteur. The conduct of these men servy-
ed to guide those that followed after
them. George Washington filled the
presidential chair with such honor that
he has inspired those who succeeded with
an ambition to do high and noble deeds.
Pasteur by his life devoted to humanity,
added many converts to the cause of pre-
venting disease. The Christian people
should take as their inspiration the life
of Jesus Christ, and we should so model
our lives after His so as to be an inspira-
tion to others. We do not need to hold
a high position in order to do this, but
we may have a beneficial influence even
though we are in the humblest walk of
life. The meeting closed with

a prayer

LOCAL PROFESSOR SPEAKS

(Continued from page 1)
Italy, France, Russia and England combined
was more than four times as great as that of
Germany and Austria-Hungary.

The second class is composed of those
who think wars are inevitable and all efforts
Fools like the
poor are always with us, and as long as there
are fools there will be war. War is an
inevitable death and taxes. Although
death is inevitable, we put forth every pos-
sible effort to stave it off as long as possible,
and so it is with our efforts to prevent war,
at best they serve only to put off a little
while,

| Then there is a third class in the popu-
lation of the next war who know that war is

not eimpossible regardless of treaties and
armaments, but who nevertheless think it is
not inevitable. Most of us belong to this
class.

Prof. Foreman stressed his main
thought, “War ought to be prevented be-
cause it is a bad thing.” It is not wrong
because it uses force, because force is neither
right nor wrong and is very useful to society
Nor is it necessarily wrong
because it takes human life, because the
State under certain conditions permits the
taking of and even itself takes human life.

War is bad because of what is costs in
money, men and morals. The World War
cost in money nearly four hundred billion
dollars and about twenty-six million human
lives. These figures, said the speaker, cannot
portray to the human mind the magnitude
of such losses, for it is unable to conccive
of them. Prof. Foreman gave some very
interesting and graphic arithmetical compar-
isons in an effort to ‘get his audience to
realize the tremendous cost of the late war
in money and men. People cannot pay. for
war. We are still paying for the war of
1812. Eighty-five per cent of the Federal
taxes go for war purposes, while only fifteen
per cent goes for constructive purposes,

The damage of war to morals cannot be
estimated. War engenders hate and crime.
The first casualty of war is Truth, for it dies
first. The stories told in America about the
atrocities and inhuman acts of the Germans
have been proved untrue.

War, even though had, should be tolerated
if the results aré good. It gets territory,
but only by killing off population. The
unity of the United States was not because of
the Civil War, but in spite of it. In the
world war we fought to end war, but they
are planning a next war even worse than the
last. America cannot stay out of a great
conflict.

War is something that we ought to try
to prevent as long as possible and forever if
possible. It is a many-sided problem and
cannot be stopped by any one thing. The
Church alone cannot, but the Church is the
conscience of America and it is our business
to speak against war now, before the war
comes and it is too late.

War is no longer a reasonable or sensible

Town News

The town passed an unusually quiet
and uneventful week. Several of the
professors made brief trips during the
week, Dr. and Mrs. Harding spending
the week-end with relatives in Charlotte.

Mrs. Archibald Currie and daughter,
Lucy Martin, are in good health again
after a period of illness due to flu, and
their many friends among the students
and townfolks will be gratified at their
recovery.

The members of the Hampden-Sidney
football team were the guests of the
college on Friday and Saturday nights.
They’ expressed themselves as being
greatly pleased and were surprised at the
courtesics extended to them by the stu-
dents and faculty of Davidson. This
treatment they described as being su-
perior to any they had received else-
where.

Professors Fleagle and Porter are
building new homes out on Shelton
Heights. They will be ready for oc-

cupancy in the early spring.
Miss May Ellinwood has arrived from
home on N. Main Street.
