JUST ASK “IVEY’S.”

The following is a list of things no
modern bobbed hair girl need carry: Hair-
pins.

A GRAVE SITUATION.

‘Here’s an opening for a nice young man,”
said the grave digger, as he threw out an-
other spadeful of dirt.

A Joint Affair—Rheumatism.

“I’m all tired out today; too much exer-
cise at the dance last night.”

Here lies my wife

Here let her lie
Now she’s at rest

A GIFTED ONE.

I had a girl, a darling thing,
She used to treat me fine,

She gave me gifts, a tie, a ring,
A jug of home-made wine.

A woolen scarf she gave to me,
Which by herself she knit;

And cigarettes quite probably
‘The best [ ever lit.

She gave me fudge, she gave me cake
It seemed a mystery; ‘

How could she think of things to make,
Just things to give to me.

‘To give me things she seemed to live—

She'd bring me home to sup;

She gave me all she had to give,

And then she gave me up.

Here is a grading scheme for some of our
“brilliant” students. It is suggested that the
Prof. give him:

5 per cent for knowing what college he is
in.

15 per cent for originality.

15 per cent for arriving on time .

10 per cent for staying full hour.

15 per cent for inventive genius.

10 per cent for knowledge of subject.

Prof.—"“What are the names of the bones
in your land, Mr. Brackman?”

Mr. Brackman—"“Dice.”

The lives of great men all remind us,
That there are some other gumps
Whose only foot-prints, when they leave us,
Are upon our dancing pumps.

FRUITLESS.
Here lies the hody of Edward Jones

An actor by profession.

Some heartless brute threw rotten fruit

And ruined his expression!

The average woman argues about the

same way she eats green corn.

You can always tell how much a girl likes
to be kissed by how shocked she looks when
you talk about it.

Prof.—“Now, Mr. Gentry, we are study-
ing about the pastoral stage in the history of
economics. Can you tell us what, the Latin:
word ‘pastor’ means?”

Gentry (rudely awakened)—“Yes
preacher !”

Slips

Slips come on pillows, banana pells, icy
pavements, tongues, etc. Also once in a
while something slips a fellow’s mind. Then
again somebody slips something over on you,
or maybe somebody slips something over on
his boss, or slips something over on the com-
pany.

A pillowslip is alright, or a cowslip, or a
good slide on slippery ice if you keep stand-
ing up, but most of the other slips are bad.
Generally speaking, when a man is slipping
he is about to fall some place. He may hit
the pavement, or his bean, or the tobaggan
slide, but it’s a cinch he’s lost his footing,
and can’t stand the pace. If a fellow has to
“slip one over” on somebody to get by, the
chances are he’s playing a slick game and
not a sguare one,

There’s no slipping if you're keeping step
with Safety First. Be square, and don't
slip.

is easy fathomable but for others cannot be
detremined, except that they have heen used
for years.

The list of nick-names and some of the
reasons for them, include :

The Praying Colonels, Centre College,
Danville, Ky., because they pray before en-
tering contests and because they come from
Kentucky, where Colonels abound,

The Flying Cadets, Virginia Military In-
stitute, Lexington, Va. because they are
military cadets and have a fast team.

The Generals, Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, Lexington, Va., because their uni-
versity was named for Generals Washington
and Lee.

The Vighting Volunteers, University of
Tennessee, Knoxville, Tenn., because of the
title of The Volunteer State, carned by Ten-
nessce in the Mexican war. ;

The Commodores, Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, ‘Tenn., because their institution
was named after Commodore Vanderbilt.

The  Hatchetites, George Washington
University, Washington, D. C., because of
the little episode of George Washington with

popular story,

The Indians, William and Mary College,

was founded back in Indian times.
