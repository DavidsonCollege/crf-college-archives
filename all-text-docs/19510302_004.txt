N. C.-State Students Put On Trial/Band To Perform

THE DAVIDSONIAN

For Scalping Student Game Tickets|Next Wednesday

The Davidson. College Concert | with a gift from his team in appre.
Band, conducted by James Chris-| ciation of his working with them

Last week the Campus Govern-
ment of N. C. State College sche-
duled a trial for three students ac-
cused of scalping tickets at the
State-Duke basketball game and
postponed action in the case of
three other students charged> with
allowing non-students to use their

athletic books.

Seven Council members and two
faculty members were appointed to
a jury to try the scalping offenders
whose names were turned over to
college authorities after City, Coun-
ty and State plainclothesmen al.
legedly caught them in the act
of selling tickets above Athletic
Department prices.

Names of defendents in both ca-
ses will be pemanently withheld
fo their protection. ; .

Action in the cases of the own-
ers of the three athletic books was
postponed until the Investigations
Committee determines the exact
nature of the alleged violation. It
was not clear whether the students
were charged with selling their
athletic books or whether they only
allowed the nonstudents to use
them free of charge.

The Prosecuting Attorney and
two Jurors went on tecord as dis-
qualifying themselves for jury duty
if they were scheduled to try the
athletic book cases. The Prosectiting
Attorney declared that he would
be forced to withdraw because “i
always take my girl to basketball
games on student books.”

One Juror said that he could not
‘consciously convict a student for
transferring his athletic book be-
cause he thought the “students
have been given a raw deal on seat-
ing.” The second Juror stated he
would withdraw only if the trial
involved the use of a student’s book
by another student. He did not think
it would be fair to punish three
students without punishing “all
4,000 violators (the entire student
body).”

The. trial of the scalping de-
fendants which will be secret, is
set for Wednesday, February 21.
The Court will return the verdict
to the Campus Government Council
with recommended penalty. The
Council cannot change the verdict,
but in event a defendant is found.
guilty, it may alter his sentence.

President McCracken reports that
this is the first time a scalping
‘case has been presented to CG,

James R. Stone of Bailey was ar-
rested at the same time the three
students were turned over to col-
lege authorites. He was fined ten
dollars ant costs in City Court
Monday when he pleaded guilty to

“clling tickets above their marked
price.

Roy Clogston, Athletic Depart.
ment head, said that Stone had 16
tickets on his body when he was
arrested Saturday night.

350. The plant facilities and endow-
ment were doubled; the teaching
force was greatly increased; the
entrance requirements were stand-
ardized; and Davidson became one
of the teading denominational
schools in the South.

From 1912 ‘until 1930 Dr. Smith
was president of Washington and
Lee. During this period a gym,
museum, chemistry building,
several other buildings were con-
structed. Dr. Smith at one time
was president of the North Caro.
lina Teachers’ Assembly and presi-
dent of the Association of Virginia
Colleges. He wrote five books and
made extensive lecture trips.

Acclaimed as one of the great
heros of World War I by Presi-
dent Woodrow Wilson, Dr. Simith
devised a method whereby the Allies
could flood Germany with pamph-
lets that were destined to under-
mine the morale of the German
people, cause riots, and “shorten
the war by months.’ By the use of
reguiated gas balloons 27,000,000
leaflets were carried into the Reich.
In 1921 he headed an official mis-
sion to England to present a bronze
replica of Houdon’s statue of
George Washington .to the people
of Great Britain. The group was
received by the King, Queen, Prince
and various other dignitaries.

Dr. Smith was a distinguished
member of the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Sci-
ence, the American Academy of
Political and Social Science, Phi
Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa,
Kappa Phi Kappa, the Rotary
Club, and the Executive Club. He
was an Elder of the First Presby-
terian Church in Greensboro. ~

Dr. Smith’ married Julia Lorraine
Dupuy, daughter of a local physi-
cian in Davidson, on August 5,
1896. He is survived by Mrs. Smith

school in South Carolina for two
years. It has been said that Blythe
has attended more athletic events
than any one man in the vicinity,
and one can scarcely attend any
sort of athletic event without see-
ing him rooting for the home team.

When asked his plans for the
future, Blythe said that he desires
very much to buy a few acres of
land near Davidson, build a house
there, and settle down to peace and
comfort. He plans to spend the
majority of his time hunting, golf-
ing, and perhaps trying his hand
at some fishing. He breathed a
sigh of relief as he said; “tl won't
have to grade papers every jight.”
As to his feelings about leaving
Davidson, Blythe says: “lam look.
ing forward to the chance to rest,
although I hate to leave my friends.
f will never lose my love for Da-
