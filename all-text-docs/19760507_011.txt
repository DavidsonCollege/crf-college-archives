Farrell recruits 38 gridders .
to add size to Wildcat lineup

Two years ago Ed Farrell
and his staff came South to try
and to save Davidson’s de-
caying football program. The
past two seasons have seen
only three victories posted by
the Wildcats, and it would
appear the football program is
approaching a crucial cross-
roads.

No one believes rebuilding
the football program has been
or will be an easy task, but the
energetic coaching staff ap-
proach their difficult task with
determination.

In order to have a good
program a team needs good
players, and, although David-
son does not need All-Ameri-
cans, it does need to attract
solid quality players. Recrui-
ting is the only way to obtain
the needed players and in the
past months the football
office has been busily recrui-
ting players.

The coaches’ efforts have
resulted in the signing of
thirty eight recruits for the
76-77 season. ‘‘I am really
pleased with the recruiting
that has been done, and we
have successfully accomp-
lished our recruiting priori-
ties,” Farrell said.

The recruiting priorities
were to obtain big linemen,
offensive, and defensive
backs. These areas were Dav-
idson’s weakest spots last
season, according to Farrell.

Davidson has recruited six-

offensive and defensive
linemen, and they are behe-
moths. Six of the tackles that
were recruited average

between them a height of:

6’3”’

Two of the best prospects
. are Rich Aiello from Florida,
who turned down a full ride at
FSU, and Dylan Faircloth
who was a first team All-State
player in Georgia.

The Wildcats lacked speed,
size and depth in both the

offensive and defensive back-
fields last season, and Farrell
has recruited several outstan-
ding players to aid in these
spots.

Craig Pyles from Miami,
and a local standout Barry
Connon from Concord are
expected to help out tremen-
dously.

A lack of full scholarships
both helps and hurts the
Davidson program. ‘‘Top pro-
spects are lost right off be-
cause of lack of scholarships,”
said Farrell.

The lack of scholarships
helps, because it removes the
money side, in Farrell's esti-
mation. ‘‘If a player wants
academics, he will come to
Davidson, if he wants money
he will go elsewhere.”’

Farrell instructs his
coaches to stress academics

and future plans when recrui-
ting. He feels that this is
Davidson's biggest recruiting
asset.

Farrell’s goals for next sea-
son is for the team ‘‘to
approach and reach a level of «
respectability.” If this levébis
achieved, the coaches hope to
post some victories.

Looking over the upcoming
76-77 schedule, Farrell felt
there were no sure losses on it.
He feel the Wildcats will be
capable of winning any game
they play. '

Optimistically, he added ‘‘’if
we gain momentum and
confidence with a few early
wins, who knows what may
happen’?’’

On a more pessimistic note
the Wildcat coach commented
“there are no sure wins on the
schedule either.”

Ruggers capture win
in year’s final match

Davidson ruggers traveled

to Belmont Abbey Sunday to
pull in the final win of the
season.

The game opened as Jeff
Morrow tripped over the line
for a try. Dan Boggus, the
Club’s ‘‘golden mistletoe,”’
made the kick for the conver-
sion setting the Wildcats up
6-0.

But the overjoyed. ruggers
were caught off guard as
Belmont scored twice in rapid
succession.

The bold rugby expression
was portrayed on the savage
defensive tackling of Mark
Armstrong, John Lewis, and
Bucky Banks.

Davidson gained control of
the game again as Rad Diller,
in a series of ‘‘up and under”’
punting, crashed Belmont’s
goal line defensive for the
second try.

the line for a try and, together
with Boggus’ conversion kick,
brought the Cats up to the
final score of 17.

Belmont’s vain attempts in
the last minutes of the game
yielded them a final score of
16.

This closing game of the
season left the final Cat record
of 7 wins, 3 losses, and 1 tie.
