Davidson Harriers

Defeated by Duke

Preceding the Duke-Davidson football
game on Thanksgiving Day the cross
country teams of these institutions’ met
in a three-mile race. The run occurred
at 11:30 o’clock. The runners of David-

son were less successful than the football |

team and went down by a 31-24 score.

The coaches of Davidson had told the
team that if they won this meet that they
would be permitted to participate in the
State meet, but the Duke team was too
strong for them. Malbry came in first.
Penn of Davidson was close on his heels.
It was a close race between these men
from the beginning but Malbry held a
silght lead throughout the grind. Malbry
ran the full three miles in sixteen minutes
flat.

The Davidson entrants of the race were
Penn, Webb, Miller, Vance, Ely, Trever-
ton, and Wiliford. Duke took first, third
and fourth places. Penn took second
place and the next places taken by the
Wildcats were fifth and sixth. Malbry
was the best runner of the race but Penn
was in his class and had he had men to
back up his beginning, the score would
have been different. After he had taken
second place the majority of the David-
son men came in the last places.

The men who~have been outefor the
cross country team this year have work-
ed hard and deserve much consideration.
They have not been semingly successful
but have done all that they could to win.

The man who sometimes receives the
greatest praise is not the one who makes the
team, but the one who sticks it out until
the last day, and if at the end of his school
he still has not made the team, he has a
world of admirers for his determi:iation.
It’s a disappointment, it is true; but a glory
in another sense.

The Davidson College classes in Edu-
cation have been giving Intelligence Tests
in the local High School. The efficiency
of the High School will doubtlessly be in-
creased by the information obtained
through these tests.

With Coveted Position on Team
IS COMPOSITE PICK
Eight Wildcats Are Placed By

Writers on Various All-State
Teams

On the composite all-state pick, made
from the selection of all the sport writers in
the state, there were three Davidson men
selected, These were Tom Baker and Harry
Vance, in the line, and Jim Hendrix, in the
backfield. Vance and Baker were chosen as
the two guards on the mythical team, while
Hendrix was selected as one of the halves.
| Carolina placed four men on this composite
‘of the mythical outfits. Wake Forest had
three and Duke, one, while the other schools
| did not place any.

This final selection was arrived at by tak-
ing the votes of the all-state teams from the
sports writers of all the leading dailies and
also the picks of the feature writers for the
Charlotte News and Observer.
| Carolina, and Riley, Wake Forest, were the
players chosen to hold down the flank posi-
tions, At tackles, Robinson, Carolina, and
Emerson, Wake Forest, were selected. Da-
vidson had the guard positions sewed up
with Baker and Vance being selected. Mc-
Iver, Carolina, holds down the pivot posi-
tion. At quarter, Rackley, Wake Forest,
was selected almost unanimously. Hendrix,
Davidson, and Underwood, Carolina, as
halves, and Caldwell, Duke, fullback, fill
out the team.

Harry Vance was picked by many for his
regular place at guard and won a place
| easily at that position. Vance is unquestion-
ably the best guard in the two Carolinas, his
| great work having been noted for two years,
| gaining complete recognition this year. One
| paper even suggested him as all-Southern
material.
| “Brassie’ Baker was chosen by some for
his old place at tackle, and others placed
him at guard. The majority seemed to place
| him at guard as a running mate for Harry,
| by whom he had played all season. It is
remarkable to note that Tom was not: men-
tioned by any writer for an end position,

|

where he won an all-state berth last year. |

As one writer put it last year, “He’s too

light for a regular lineman, but he’s just too |

| darned good to be left off any team!”

Jim Hendrix is the third Wildcat on the
mytHical eleven. Jim was handicapped this
season,
| After the Elon ‘game he took Sappenfield’s
place at quarter. _But even under this burden,
he played a brilliant game and was on the
| pick of practically every writer.
| Several other Davidson players were men-
tioned on the first teams of some of the
sports writers. These were McConnell,
Black, Laird, Arrowood, and Pinckney.
Practically the entire Davidson varsity was
mentioned on some first or second all-state
team.

Machinery works: Man thinks

According to college tests, man develops one-eighth
horsepower for short periods and one-twentieth in
steady work. As a craftsman—a worker who uses
brains—he is well worth his daily wage. Butasa
common laborer, matching brawn against motor-
ized power, he is an expensive luxury.

GENER

With a fifty-horsepower motor, for instance, one
man can do the work of 400 common laborers. He
is paid far more for his brains than his brawn.

The great need of this and future generations is
for men who can plan and direct. There is ample
motorized machinery for all requirements of pro-
duction and construction. But motorized machinery,
no matter how ingenious, can never plan for

itself.

And that is precisely where the college man comes

in.

Highly trained brains are needed more and

more to think, plan, and direct tasks for the
never-ending application of .brawn-saving elec-

tricity.
