ago, and seems headed toward
rapid improvement in its second
season of varsity play.
Withaconvincing victory
over Lenoir-Rhyne Wednesday,
the Davidson baseball team im-
proved its record to 24-21-1, and
remains in quest of its fourth win-
ning season in the last five years.
With the win in that game, senior
ace Greg Wilcox moved his spar-
kling record to 11-2. A win by
Wilcox over the weekend against
UNCC would set a new school
record for victories ina season bya
pitcher. Much of the Wildcats’
_ success this season is due to solid
defense; Davidson presently ranks

11th in the nation with a fielding
percentage of .968. Senior second-
baseman Mikio Aoki was recently
named ECAC Player of the Week;
he leads the team with a batting
average of .372.

Athletic director-elect Terry
Holland was in town Sunday, serv-
ing as the keynote speaker at the
all-sports awards banquet. He of-
fered some fresh thought on the
future of the Wildcat athletic pro-
gram: “We want to be the best we
can be. But we want to do it right.
By that, I mean we want to do it
with dignity and integrity.” Mrs.
Holland has hinted that the Hol-
lands’ stay in Davidson may be a
brief one. I’d like to offer a personal
plea to Mr. Holland: say it ain’t so.

Rugby Wins Tournament

pola joined the team as a faculty
advisor/player. Hiscontributions
both on and off the field have
helped the team to grow consid-
erably. Unfortunately, he was
forced to limit his fervor to the
sideline when he was reminded of
his age by a torn pectoral muscle.

The progress which has taken
place over the course of the spring
season alone has been remarkable.
The self-proclaimed S+M Crew
emerged from a field of 28 teams
and walked away as the Bowl
Champions of the Steinlager North

Carolina State Rugby Tournament
with a convincing 14-0 pounding
of St. Andrews. UNCC handed the
‘Cats a narrow early season loss,
but were, nonetheless, impressed
by the team’s talent. Duke, too,
proved to be an insurmountable
foe; they won 17-9 at-a crowded
Spring Frolics game. But the Crew
was again victorious against St.
Andrews, winning 9-6 in a mid-
week home game.

With enthusiasm so high, and
close games a constant, the team
looks forward to an even stronger
season next year. New players have
quickly become addicted to the

game, and returning players areas
devoted as ever. New players have
discovered that the fun comes not
only from the game, but from the
post-game celebrations as well
(reg, s of the seore). Injuries
haveremained remarkably low this
year; no player has been injured
for more than a one or two week
period. The team thanks all of our
faithful supporters (over 100at the
Duke game) and encourages all
thatare interested tocomeout next
year either to play or watch. If you
have any questions about playing
next year, please contact Tim Har-
ris at -6194.
