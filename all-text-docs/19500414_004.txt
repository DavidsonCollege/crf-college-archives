ITALIAN PROTESTANTS

SEEK RELIGIOUS FREEDOM To Problems Of Job

Americans are called upon to ‘‘compel’’ the Italian govern-
ment to abide by the religious freedom clause of its peage treaty
in a resolution adopted recently by protestants in that country
and circulated in the United States by Dr. Frank B. Gigliotti of
Washington, D. C., author of the clause.

Gigliotti said he received the res-.

olution from the Rev. Anthony Ca-
liandro, director of the Evangeli-
cal Biblical Institute of Italy.

Gigliotti. is vice chairman of the
Commission on Religious Liberties
of the National Association of
Evangelicals. He helped write both
the Italian peace treaty and the
constitution of the Italian Repub.
lic,

The resolution was prompted by
press reports quoting the Italian
interior ministry as telling the Unit-
ed States embassy American pro-
testant activities in Italy often aid
Communism. These reports devel-
oped from difficulties of American
evangelists of the Church of Christ
headquartered at Frascati, near
Rome.

Addressed to the U. S. depart-
ment of state, the U. S. embassy
in Rome and to “the American pub-
lic' in general,” the resolution reads
as follows:

“Where The Associated Press re.
ports in THE DAILY AMERI-
CAN of Rome, of January 13, 1950.
that, the Italian Foreign Ministry
has told the United States Embas-
sy in Rome that American Protes-
tant activities in Italy often aid
Communism . . . and that a spokes-
man of said Ministry said that this
view has been expressed to offi-
cials in Washington;

“And whereas the same spokes.
man is quoted as stating that Com-
munists are about the only Italians
who join Protestant cults, and that
these cults acquire political ends
masking Communism with relig-
ion;

“Be it resolved that we, members
of several Protestsiét churches in
Naples and vicinity, assembled this
13th: day of January 1950, to hear
a lecture offered by the regular pro-
gram of The Evangelical Biblical
Institute of Italy, located at 162
Corso Garibaldi, Portici, Naples,
Italy, having taken time at the con-
clusion of the lecture to discuss
the accusations against Protestants
emanating from the Italian inter-

ior ministry, do hereby righteous.

false, and malicious accusations in-

tended to justify ill-treatment and |:

discriminatory laws against evan-
gelical ministers, missionaries and
Protestant churches in Italy;

as Protestants, proud of a glorious
heritage, which through the cen-
turies has been a leavening influ-
ence for righteousness and progress

Science Concerned
Over Sleeplessness

_ Hempstead, N. Y, — (ACP)—
A feature writer of the Hofstra
Chronicle asks, “Do you know of
the research that is constantly go-
ing on concerning ‘How to get a
good night's rest?”

A first conclusion reached by
scientists is that a certain amount
of tossing and turning is necessary
to healthful sleep. Therefore the
mattress should be large enough
so that you don’t land off-side.

Did you know that in an eight-
hour sleep your breathing lifts the
blankets seven thousand times? If
you use heavy blankets, that’s
work, brother. Back sleepers should
use a thin pillow, curlers and stom.
ach sleepers, a, V-shaped pillow.

Ear plugs made of synthetic wax
and cotton are safe and eliminate
much troublesome noise. Hunger
can keep you awake. A light snack
of hot milk, soup or broth may be
in order.

If you are a night worrier or are
beset with a feeling of guilt because
of incompleted day’s duty, count
sheep, relax, read something not
too stimulating—or do homework.

ing untold persecutions, massacres,
banishments, and social and econo-
mic boycotts, do call upon all Amer-
icans to compel the Italian govern-
meut to abide by, respect, and exe-
cute Article 15, Section I, Part I,
of the Peace Treaty signed in Paris
on February 10, 1947, and which
has since been ratified by the gov-
ernments concerned, which pro.
vides:

“Italy shall take all measures
necessary to secure to all persons
under Italian jurisdiction, without
distinction as to race, sex, language
or religion, the enjoyment of hu-
man rights and of the fundaniental
freedoms, including freedom of ex-
pression, of press and publication,
of religious worship, of political
opinion and of public meeting.”

“And be it further resolved that
we, as Protestants in Italy, do gall
upon the Italian people to see. that
the rights and duties of citizens as
provided by the Constitution of the
Italian Republic be enforced. We,
therefore, claim as our rights, the
guarantee which Article 19 of the
Italian Constitution provides, that:

ROTC Rifle Team
Completes Season

The Rifle Team recently com-
pleted a very successful season.
With a team comprised chiefly of
new men, 31 matches were fired
over the course of the season of 4
months. Of the 31 matches, 17 were
won. This included 5 victories in
6  shoulder-to-shoulder matches.
The remaining 25 matches were
postal. The schedule fired includ.
ed such institutions as Clemson,
Universities of Georgia, Alabama,
Tennessee, Florida, and Montana,
The Citadel, N. C. State, Wofford,
Syracuse, Mississippi State and the
University of Mississippi, High
upperclassmen during the year
were: W. W. Abbott, A. D. Grose-
close, J. W. Leaycraft, A. S. Mi
ree, C, D. Parker. High freshman
was G. F. Bason,

Two years ago last fall the Da-
vidson campus was blessed with
the appearance of the same timid,
mischievous grin that had come
to the Haynes family of Bristol,
Tenn., some 21 years ago. In both
cases this grin was worn by Hal
Haynes, along with it came several
accessories including a good hank
of dark hair, a set of pearly white
teeth, and long, seductive eyelash-
es, which Hal used to trim in gram-
mar school because the girls said
they were so pretty.

Back in Bristol Hal was quite
an athlete. He played football three
years, baseball two years, ran track
two years, and pole vaulted an
eleven foot six inch city record,
which still stands. Hat doesn’t
know when he started boxing ex-
actly, but when he was ten years old
he got plenty of practice when his
family moved two miles out in the
country. Walking into town to the
city school every day he had to
pass by the county school. Probably
there were at that school several
young athletes always eager for a
chance to engage in pugilistics, for
Hal got into a fight almost every
day. Later Hal's friends entered
him several times in Golden Gloves
contests, in which he has won the
middleweight championship in
Bristol more than once.

For the past two years “The
Brute” (the origin of ‘this nick-
name is one of the guarded secrets
of the Haynes’ security files which
cannot be released to the press) has
been a member of the varsity wrest-
ling team. Last year he was held

4back by injuries, but this year he

Early Search Answer SARACENIC OPTOMETRIST | Out Of The Crocodile’s Mouth

If you are one of the few people
who went to sleep last night, you
probably woke up this morning.
Then what happened? Worn out
from week end dating, football
practice or parallel reading, David-
son students customarily awake
(five minutes after their first per-
iod class starts) sans use of senses,
saving that of sight. Wonderful,
isn’t it, that these optic senses are
ready to serve you from the time
you sling your head into ice water
until you sit down in class, It’ is
only through these ophthalmic or-
gans that you can see the finer
things of life.

As the old saying goes: “You
don’t miss the water till the well
runs dry.” Therefore, in order to
more fully appreciate your optics,
you must hypothetically abolish
the eye and all of its facets-till the
well runs dry. Cast yourself into
a world of darkness,

Do you realize that no longer
could you use the obsolete expres-
sions: “Do you see the point,” “The
eyes have it,” “Look here, old
boy"? ete.

Braille you could ever master The

Hungry Graduates

Lawrence, Kan. — (ACP) —“If
you're the June graduate who, wor-
ries about the job hunt, you would
do well to organize a plan as to
where, how and when to look for
a job,” says a feature writer of
the University Daily Kansan.

Start right now. Make up a
resume sheet about your qualifica-
tions; including experience, inter-
ests, references, activities, skills,
education, what kind of job you
want, and when you could start
working. If you are an artist, writ-
er or designer or anyone with tal-
ent to display, make up a single
but attractive presentation book of
your work.

If you want to strike out on your
own and apply directly to a firm's
employment office, write a short
application letter to the personnel
head. Ask for an appointment if
the firm is near. Enclose a resume
sheet.

The public relations office can
furnish you with up to the minute
information on employment condi-
tions in your field. Private. employ-
ment agencies will pave the way
for an interview, give the employer
an honest picture of the employee's
qualifications and the job-secke:
an accurate account of the firm.
The private agency has the ad-
vantage over public agencies by
offering more professional jobs.
The fee for their services is usually
about one-half the first month’s
