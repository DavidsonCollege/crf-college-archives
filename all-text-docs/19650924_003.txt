THE DAVIDSONIAN

‘MODEST PARTICIPATION’

Clark Describes August Riots

(Editor's note: Associate Ed-
itor Johnny Clark, along with
Bill Briggs, DAVIDSONIAN
Sports Editor, and Sonny
Graves, was in usually placid
Los Angeles last month at the
time of that city’s turbulent
riots. Following is the first of
two accounts of his impres-
sions of the disorders.)

By JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Associate Editor
(First of two articles)

It was a routine occur-
rence. A California state
trooper stopped a Negro in
Los Angeles’ Watts district
and attempted to arrest him
for drunken driving, a vio-
lation of the law no matter
phat color a person might

e.

Yet this ‘brutal’ act by a
law officer set off the worst-riot
in the United State sinée ‘1932. a
riot which was to last for a week,
and in which 37 people were
eventually killed and 900 in-
jured.

Our vantage point during the
riots was the Pi Kappa Alpha
house at the University of South-
ern California. a campus de-
scribed to us as ‘a white dot on
a black map."' The school was
north of Watts, the center of the
tiot area, but was still well with-
in the National. Guard-occupied
riot zone.

However, our participation in
the disturbances themselves was
rather modest, as we contented
ourselves with sitting out on the
roof of the house at night, ‘‘de-

fending’ the place with shot-
guns, listening to police and fire
sirens around us, along with the
occasional sound of sniper fire
and watching the best L, A.’s TV
stations had to offer against the
brilliant background of an or-
ange sky. glowing from the fires
in the not-so-distant distance.
We were in some danger.
though, as one moron on the roof
with us let the gun in his lap go
off. missing Bill’s foot by about
a foot and scaring the heck out
of us all. We all decided to turn
in shortly after this bit of ex-
citement. figuring that with that
jdiot on the roof, the safest place
around was in bed.
* The radio and TV stations did
a thgrough job of reporting the
week-long event, with all dav
and night coverage which re-
minded me somewhat of the con-
tinuous coverage of the flights of

the third night of the riots. we
were stopped by a police block-
ade while returning to the fra-
ternity house.

Four Negroes were lined up
against a wall with their hands

over their heads. The police told
us of sniper fire ahead, said that
we could enter at our own risk,
and wished us luck. The riot
was now real to us.

The enormity of the violence
amazed me. The riot area cov-
ered 50 square miles. The L.A.
police department needed the
help of 15.000 national guards-
men, almost as many troops as
were sent to the Dominican Re-
public at the height of that cri-
sis, to get the violence under
reasonable control. Arrests to-
taled 4.000 as 1.000 businesses
were totally or partly destroved
and damage estimates reached
over $200 million.

Whole city blocks burned as
mobs turned away fire trucks
with rocks.. fists, bottles. and
gunfire. Police reinforcements

there, however, 45 ambulances
refused to enier the area after
thé rioters had begun to call in
false reports in order to lure
white ambulance workers into
the zone.

Tronically, over half of the
deaths were Negroes. Many of
these were apprehended rioters
who fired on police or fled ar-
rest. Others were more pitiable,
such as the small Negro child
who was killed by a sniper as he
sat on his front lawn with his
mother because it was too hot
inside.

yeent Negro),

One extremely ironic conse-
quence of the burning and loot-
ing was an acute food shortage,
hitting hardest those responsible
Negroes who had not participat-
ed in looting the food stores. The
stores in the area had been oot-
ed and burned, any that had pos-
sibly survived were not open.
and Negroes of the area could
not. get out to get food from oth-
er areas. The shortage was final-
ly alleviated by state welfare
handouts.

Still another irony was that the
same Negro mobs shouting ‘‘po-
lice brutality" on the first nights
of the riots were those who gent-
ly pulled unwary white motor-
ists from their cars and loving
‘ly pounded them into the pave

The racial aspects of the riots

On the third day of the riots a
radio announcer reported a tele-
gram that L.A. Police | Chief
Parker had received from the
head of the Alabama State Po-
lice, stating simply. “Now you
know the meaning of the Negro
rion-violent movement.”’ The vet-

Work And Study Space

Davidson’s library underwent
a far-reaching program of im-
provement and expansion over
the summer. Book space was
expanded, new workrooms were
added and study facilities were
improved, Dr. Chalfners David-
son, director of the library re-
ported.

Funds for this program were
provided mostly through annro-
priations and a $40,000 grant
from Duke Endowment. The
grant more than doubled the
funds appropriated by the col-
lege.

Three new offices and work-
rooms were constructed on the
First floor in the Babcock Wing
for the processing of books and
periodicals. One room is used

for preparing books ‘and maga-,

companies and assembling them
on return. Another is a new

Vespers Will Get
Terry's ‘New Look

A new look in the vespers
program will be forthcoming,
Cotlege Chaplain Will Terry
indicated recently. This new
look places a greater emphasis
on the educational experience
of vespers through the use of
worship services from various
traditions. For instance, Sun-
day Terry plans to take the
form of service from the An-
gilcan tradition.

In the future there will be

from the University of Oklahoma. In February
1962, he ser world class time-to-climb records in a

Is the YF-12A the world’s fastest manned aircraft?
It certainly is. On May 1.of this year the YF-12A
(formerly known as the A-11) reclaimed tho world
absolute speed record from the USSR. It was
clocked at 2,062 mph over Edwards Air Force Base.

How big is the YF-12A?___

The exact dimensions of the YF-12A have not bees
released yet. But it's approximately 100 feet long,
with abeut a $0-foot wingspan. That's half again

Can I keep up my studies while

The Air Force encourages its men and women to
