Discussed by Dr. Arbuckle

‘Fundamentals of Christianity Illus-
trated by Chemical Reaction
The most original service held in

Shearer Hall for several years was given
by Dr, Arbuckle last Sunday night on

jthe unique subject “Chemistry in Re-!

iligion.” which he illustrated with ac-
‘tual experiments. ‘The very nature of
‘the subject was so unusual and interest-
‘ing that a large percentage of the stu-
dent body turned out to hear Dr. Ar-
buckle. Two tables were loaded with
chemical apparatus, and made the ros-
trum look like a small laboratory.
Dr. Arbuckel was going to find any con-

: * fa t
nection between chemistry and religion.

and what kind of experiments he was
going to work kept everyone puzzled.
Dr. Arbuckle handled the difficult sub-
ject with ability, however, and made a
deep impression upon the minds of his
audience,

“Chemistry,” Dr. Arbuckle said, “is:

an interesting subject.” The world
could not have been made without chem-
ical actions. All living matter is de-
pendent upon chemicdi actions for ex-
istence. Jt was the purpose of Dr. Ar-
buckle to emphasize certain ‘moral and
religious facts by showing that they held
good in chemistry.

In chemistry as in religious life strong
personality and energy will make them-
selves vital forces into whatever they
enter. A college man endowed with such
characteristics can be depended upon to
strengthen and help college life around
him. He will be a leader. So it is ni
chemistry. For illustration Dr. Ar-
buckle took a small rod of iron, tipped
with lighted sulphur, and lowered it into
a bottle of oxygen. The powerful en-
ergy of the oxygen melted the iron bar,
molten drops of which dropped into the
water below.

On the other hand, the weak element
has as much effect as the strong element.
in many cases. It is the little weak-
nesses that underground a man's moral
character. Men of little influence in
college life have their weaknesses clearly
shown when anything they undertake
disintegrates.
certain substances which are so weak
that the touch of a feather renders them
powerless. Dr. Arbuckle touched sev-
eral combinations of chemicals and im-
mediately an explosion occurred. It was
a larger amount of this material which
'did so much injury to Spencer and Wy-
man a week ago. ‘The weakness in the
material became a powerful factor to do
evil.

The right choice of friends and co-
workers plays a large part in a man’s
life. ‘Many men who come to college
and accomplish nothing are kept from
success bv friends who hinder instead of
help. Many chemicals cannot act with-
out a helper.
without the great Helper to sustain and
‘direct us. As Dr. Arbuckle showed in a

ever we try to do. No one should ever
try to “carryon” in his own strength, re-
sisting Him who would aid and help
that individual.
should say. “I can do all things thru
Christ which strengtheneth me.”

|BAD WEATHER HAS NO TER-
RORS FOR COUNTRY SUNDAY

SCHOOLS—ALL SHOW GAINS. |
The Sunday Schools had a good day:

Sunday. All of those who held classes
showed at least a slight gain. Early in
‘the day it was doubtful if it would be
possible to hold the meetings. The day
‘cleared up. however, and all but one of
‘the schools were there in large num-
| bers.

Caldwell and Shearer Chapel showed
the largest increase. Caldwell added
six to their number of last Sunday, giv-

| ine a total of seventy, eight of which

were teachers. Shearer Chapel had fifty-;

ur, with eleven teachers.
Oak Grove and Cowan each gained
three. Cowan numbered thirteen and
Oak Grove thirty-nine, both school had
four teachers.

Cornelius reported sixty-nine present
with four teachers.

The Mill led with an attendance of
sixty-three.

THIS IS WHERE SOME FEL-
LOWS SPEND SUNDAY
AFTERNOON.

Probably the most interesting of the
seven Mission Sunday Schools of | the
Davidson Y. M. C. A. is the one which
is maintained at Brawley. This school
is located about five miles to the west
of Mooresville, in the southwestern cor-
ner of Iredell county.

The work at this point has been very
successful for several years past. In-
addition to the regular Sunday School,
,some outside speaker is secured as often
as possible. Rev. S. H. Hay, of Moores-
ville; Dr. Arbuckle, Dr. Richards, and
Mr. Miles have all taken an active in-
terest in this phase of the work, and,
have done much to help in building up
the school.

The people who attend the meetings |
‘are of three different denominations. In
spite of this fact, however, they have
worked faithfully and harmoniously to-"
gether. An organ has recently been pur-
chased for the school and paid for by the
‘contributions of the members

RELIGIOUS FORECAST FOR
COMING SUNDAY—WHY
NOT PREPARE A LESSON?

The Bible study groups are daily com-
ing, to the place where the problems dis-
cussed may be applied to the life on the
campus.

Last Sunday everyone attending
classes went away with a more concrete
idea of the Kingdgm of God. ‘Then too
that after all worrying does. not yet a
person anywhere.

Next Sunday the study will have to
do with the tasks of the Kingdom of
God.
tions of vital interest arise. In the first
place, how far is a person who pro-

duces nothing, of use to a community?

Again, where is the idler’s place in the
Kingdom of Ged? Furthermore, what
is the spiritual obligation of college men
to the Kingdom of God? Finally, can
an over-worked and under-paid work-
man feel that he is working for the
Kingdom of Ged?

What is your idea in regard to these
question? Tf you have an idea it is
worth bringing to class Sunday. Give
the class on your hall a trial. Will you?

THAT'S IT! KEEP UP ‘THE
GOOD WORK! BIBLE CLASSES
SHOW INCREASE.

‘The total number attending Bible
classes Sunday showed a slight increase.
Altho the number was far short of the
first Sunday it looks well to be on the
up grade. The count shows that two
hundred and = twenty were present,
which is not Davidson's best. by any
means. ,

Louisianz and third floor Watts both
had a perfect attendance.

Georgia and Watts were’ the other
dormitories who showed an increase be-
sides Louisiana. Georgia had thirty-one,
which is a little better than last Sun-
day. Watts gained four, having thirty-
nine present.

Rumple and Chambers again turned
in reports that are slightly under their
previous records. .Rumple _ reported
forty-six present and Chambers ecighty-
three. Since Rumple started with a
good record they still have a good regu-
lar attendance in total numbers,

Much life and “pep” is being instilled
into the classes, so a steady increase is
looked for. |

“y” SECRETARY FROM WIN-
STON-SALEM SOON TO AD-
DRESS LOCAL ORGANIZATION.

Mr. Allen M. Craig, General Secre-
tary of the Y. M. C. A. in Winston-
Salem, N. C., will speak to the college
1Y. M. C. A. next Sunday. When the
United States declared war, Mr. Craig
volunteered for “Y” service and was
sent to Russia. During his nincteen
months’ stay in Russia, Mr. Craig trav-
eled extensively, covering the greater
part of Russia, being in Moscow for a
.short time during the Russian revolu- |
‘tion. There is a possibility that Mr.
|Craig will be unable to get here next
Sunday, and in such case he will be with
us the following Sunday.

“wo to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then
a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in
touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen
his strong points. Asa result, our Training School men are making good.
