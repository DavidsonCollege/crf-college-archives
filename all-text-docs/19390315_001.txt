organization of the group, there-
fore involving the election of a
chairman and a secretary. The law
states’ that one of the members
shall be a resident of Charlotte,
and that the other two members
shall be rural residents of the
county.

The last appearance in public of
the county police problem was an
attempt to pass a bill in the Gen-
eral Assembly allowing the civil
commissioners to be named by the
county commissioners instead of
by the resident judge. But senti-
ment has registered so much
against it, that the proposed bill
was regarded as dead.

all Senior officers wore their R.

was regarded by a majority of the

Head Baseball Coach Is Not
Ready to Make Decision
on Matter

Flake (Red) Laird, David-
son's head baseball coach and

coach in other sports, has re-
ceived an offer from Virginia
Polytechnic Institute. for a
coaching position in that
school similar to the one
which he now occupies.

The Davidsonian has known for
some time of developments to this
effect, but, as the authorities re-
peatedly denied them, was not aus
thorized to make them — public.
Coach Laird has, however, serious-
ly discussed the matter with col-
lege officials.

; No Decision Yet

Coach Laird states that he has
not reached a decision as to wheth-
er he will accept or reject the of-
fer’ from V. P. I. and that it will
probably be some time until he
decides definitely. “I’ve been at
Davidson so long it would not be
easy to pick up and leave. How-
ever, the place at V. P. I. has its
advantages,” was his statement.

Laird, a former Davidson all-
round athlete, has many’ old pals
at V. P. I. Among them are Monk
Younger and Tex Tilson with
whom he worked fof many years
here at Davidson during the ten
years that he has been affiliated

with the school. Prior to his coach-

ing at Davidson, Laird coached for
two years at Catawba College.
