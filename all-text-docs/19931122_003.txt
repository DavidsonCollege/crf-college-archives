What does the P.O. do wi th all the junk mail we trash?

By Jay Jennings

Every week Davidson College
students can count onat least some-
thing in their mailbox because
stores like Roses and Bi-Lo send
out flyers without fail. Although it
is nice not to have an empty box,
the flyerscan bean annoying waste.
Most students take one look at the
flyers and throw them out.

The flyers are annoying not
only for students, but also for &e
workers at the Post Office. The
workers must put the flyers in the
boxes even though they know that
they will go right into the trash
cans. Then, someone else must
clean all of the trash on the days
after the flyers are delivered.

Elaine Connor, the Davidson
postmaster, says that she has to put
the flyers in the boxes because the
companies have paid forthem. The
companies generate money for the
Post Office, thus it makes no sense
to refuse the money.

She realizes that “most
Davidson students will not look at
flyers from Roses and Bi-Lo,” but
if the companies send 4,000 flyers
to the Post Office, they must be put

Oxfam fast
has lowest
turnout ever

Davidson. made.an_ effort to
participate in the Oxfam America
fast on Tuesday, November 16;
however, the turnout was seriously
lacking with a small number of
eight students for dinner.

Oxfam America, of the Ox-
ford Committee for Famine Re-
lief, was founded in England in
1942. Oxfam is celebrating its
50th anniversary. Oxfam works
with overseas organizations to as-
sess local needs, develop programs,
and monitor results.

in the corresponding boxes.
Connor has recommended to
some companies that they should
only send enough for the towns-
people and not the students. She

has been able to convince some
stores of this, but others continue
to send them.

The flyers do have a purpose
for some students. Some really use

them to find out about discounts
and available products at the vari-
ous stores.

Shelly Helms, the manager of
the Roses store in Cornelius, said

that the flyers are “Roses’ main
way of advertising” and thus Roses «
needs to send them out to as many
people as they cin. She feels that
if only a handful of people come to
the store because of the flyers, then
they have served their purpose.

Roses has done surveys about
their customers and use this infor-
mation to determine where the fly-
ers go. Contrary to popular belief,
there is some method to the mad-
ness of sending them to students.

Connor wants to set up some
sort of recycling program for the
flyers that are thrown away, but
she does not have the time nor the
money to do this.

She hopes that a Davidson
student will be interested in recy-
cling to help combat the excess
trash caused by the fliers.

Thad Reece thinks the flyers
“are like the consolation prize in
kindergarten. One kid wins the
game, but everyone gets a prize.”

If the flyers help someone find
a bargain, they serve a purpose for
those who advertise. Or maybe the
flyers can make some people feel
better about their mail box.

SGA proposes dorm resolution

Belk continued from page 1

ued to say that even if the resolu-
tion is not acted upon for next year,
“it makes a statement implying
what direction Davidson should
go.”

However, on the opposing

Stand point, vice president Alice
_ Spivey said that there wereenough .
’ people against the resolution within

the SGA that there is no way it
should be implemented next year.
Spivey claimed that there are other
ways to improve gender relations
without calling for cohabitation.

BJ Rudell, of course, “feels
pretty strongly about it.” He com-
mented that the senators who voted
down the proposal were’ those
“more traditional in values,”
whereas those who supported the
resolution want “to break down
the stereotypes of the sexes.”

As Smith noted, the council
was very split on the decision. The
sophomore representatives are
prime examples of this: Bo
Bartholomew voted it down; Kelly
Cunningham affirmed it; while
Nick Troiano abstained.

What happens now?

According to Richard Terry

- of Residence Life, the resolution is

exactly that: aresolution. Whether
or not the resolution will be acted

upon for next fall is seriously in

question.

Due to the “sensitive nature”
of the controversy, Tetry is hesi- |
tant to say that it will actually be
implemented asitis “firmly stated.” —
Lacking in options, the resolution
may force freshmen into a situa-
tion that might not be in their best —

However, Richard Terry com-
mented that this “starts the dia-

logue in a formal, 5 NSEY civilized
and efficient way.”

Inevitably, the fesclution will »
go to the Dean of Students for the |
final say in what will happen or not
happen. However, according to
Richard Terry, the Trustees may
even intervene in this matter due to
the major impact it would have on
the college from all perspectives.

Upon first glance at the reso-
lution, Dean Terry simply stated,
“I don’t agree with it.” He claimed
that freshmen have enough to deal
with when entering college that
they do not need another extra
added stress as would be there with
cohabitation.

Dean Terry also noted that the
maturity level of freshmen, par-
ticularly of men, “is not ready for it
yet.” He thinks that in the long run
there will be more friction between
the sexes as a result of coeduca-
tional housing for freshmen.

When asked, “Where will it
go now?” Dean Terry responded
that he did not know. Says Terry,
“When I am officially presented
with it, we will discuss it at the
CCRL meeting.”
