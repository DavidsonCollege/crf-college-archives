SURE THEY FIGHT.
THEY’RE WILDCATS!

With the dope against them
and sports writers so beneficent
in offering sympathy, Wildcat
teams have a way of springing
upsets that are startling. Not
only in the Clemson game last
Saturday did they fight against
tremendous odds but time after
time have they held on with a
stick-to-it-iveness and a tenacity
that resulted in a creditable nota-
tion on the ledger.

Scheduled to lose by three or
four touchdowns, they engaged:
the South Carolina boys with a
vengeance, holding a much heav-
ier team time and time again until
the opponent’s resort to the air
netted a lone touchdown.

Credit to Monk and Tex! They
are fine coaches and can do won-
ders with a veritable dearth of
material. And credit, too, to that
material! Maybe not so husky
and experienced¥as some teams
but they have that spirit — that
fighting Wildcat determination.
And that was what Official Harry
Hartsell was talking about when
he paid tribute last Monday “to
Davidson’s fighting spirit and the
youngsters’ ability to do what Da-
vidson coaches had taught them.”

DOES BUSINESS WANT

SCHOLARS?
College graduates with high
marks are more than twice as

likely to acquire a private office
and a five figure salary as those
who skin through down at the
foot of their class, according to a
nation-wide survey made hy the
American Telephone and Tele-
graph company and reported by

Walter S. Gifford, president, in
Harpers.
The investigation was made

among the 3,800 college-graduate
employees of that company and
covered a period of two vears.
1,600 were less than five vears out
of college and the remainder were
from five to thirty years out.
Their records were obtained from
104 colleges.

“It is clear,” says Mr. Gifford,
“that the Bell System, on the av-
erage, men who were good stu-
dents have done better than those
who were not. There are, of
‘course, exceptions — men who
were poor students who are suc-
ceeding well and the men who
were good students succeeding
less well — but on the whole
the evidence is very striking that
there is a direct relation between
high marks in college and salaries
afterward in the Bell System.

“Men in the first third of their
college classes are most likely to
,be found in the highest third of
their group in salary, those in the
middle third in scholarship to be
in the middle third in salary” and
so Ch.

“The longer the best students
are in business, the more rapidly
their earnings rise. The longer
the poorer students are in busi-
ness, the slower their earnings
rise.

“The big law firms seek the
high-mark .men from the law
schools. The profession believes
that the man who stands well in
his law studies will make a better

lawyer than one who does not.
“The hospitals take the same

attitude toward medical students.

But business, on the other hand,
does not as a rule select men on
the basis of their marks in col-
lege.

“Tf studies by others corrobor-
ate the results of this study in
the Bell System and it becomes
clear that the mind well trained
in youth has the best chance to
succeed .in any business it may
choose, then scholarship as a
measure of mental equipment is
of importance both to business
and business men.”

A HITCH IN HIKING

New Jersey has recently leg-
islated against the popular col-
legiate pastime of  “bumming,”
“hitch-hiking,” “highwaying,” or
what you will. Since September
1 it has been an offense for any-
one to ask for or to offer a ride
on the open highways of that
state.

Should this measure..prove val-
uable and be récommended by
New Jersey official$ as pi leg-
islation, then similar measures
might be effected in other sec-
tions. It is purely a protective
course from both viewpoints and
purposes to abolish the danger
frequently involved when motor-
ists are inclined to be hospitable.

This brings to mind certain
agitation in this state last spring
and the utter condemnation of
any who would seek rides in this
manner,

Gentlemen, be gentlemen as
you practice the art of “bum-
ming” or your style may be some-
what cramped.

SEA SONG

Up anchor, mates, the flooding tide

Is flowing full and free.

The sunrise path of yellow gold

Leads to the open sea.

The wind is rushing through the sheets

The swift sea by the keel,

The green tide swirls about the stern

And pulls the fast-lashed wheel.

The mainsail strains its halyards

And billows to be free,

For the merry crack of canvas sounds

The sea's wild liberty.

Up anchor, mates, and set her sails ;

lye, crowd on every inch

For « gallant craft have we, lads,

She'll never warp or flinch,

Now trim her true and right, lads,

Her mainmast boom swing wide,

Make fast that jib at the topmast

And ease her to the tide.

She's sailing fair and true, lads,

<1 gallant craft have we;

We'll set her course to the

And steer for the open sea.

Allowing that any religious book of
large proportions, teaching a certain

seven in the world which are admitted
to be greater than the others, Of
course, the Bible or Holy Scripture is
well known and the most widely read
book in print. Parts of the Bible, cer-
tainly the Pentateuch, are at least
three hundred years older than the
most ancient of other religious writ-
ings. Next to the Bible, the Vedas, or
books of the Hindus, are the oldest.

Cosmic Chaos

The “London Spectator” recently
had an article giving figures and facts
to prove that the men educated under
the Rhodes scheme amply justify
their place. Ill-informed carpers have
made ridiculous capital of the absence
of Rhodes scholars from the circle of
world leadership, without consider-
ing, as this journal points out, that
fully seventy-five per cent of them
are still in their thirties, and have
hardly had time to attain the seats of
the mighty.

Indeed, it is possible that the ma-
jority of Rhodes scholars will never
figure prominently in the more spec-
tacular affairs of life, for they have
chosen that broader and_ infinitely
more valuable field of service, educa-
tion. About forty per cent of the
Americans who have studied at Ox-
ford as Rhodes scholars are now
teaching, and are better equipped for
that work, doubtless, than most of
their associates who lacked Rhodes
training. Law has attracted the second
jhighest number while business has
proved a lure to only half the num-
ber who chose legal careers. Public
service, in the former sense of that
term, has not won many Rhodes stu-
dents, though many realms of public
service are represented in the list of
their vocations. Medicine, journalism,
farming, research work, diplomacy,
and chemical service all claim a por-
tion of them

Cecil Rhodes’ primary object in the
establishment of the scholarship was
to promote international fellowship,
and this purpose, the Spectator shows
has been conspicuously fulfilled. No-
where did he ever assign as one of his
intentions the training of young men
who could go out into the world and
accumulate money. Those who have
judged the success of his system by
that standard have erred grossly at
the start.

President Angell, of Yale, says a
political platform is nothing but hot
air. He forgets, however, that many

politicians can blow both hot and
cold,
The record of the last hundred

years, and especially of the last fifty,
has been the enormous multiplication
of one-man-power by newly discoverd

In the opening address at Columbia

University, Prof. D. G. Mason called

attention to the exasperating paradox
that, “with the greater amount of
leisure which science applied to in-

dustry puts at our disposal, the more
unleisurely, hurried, distracted, noisy
and feverish our actual life seems to
become.” The solitary side of our na-
ture demands leisure for reflection up-
on subjects on which the dash and
whirl of our daily life forbid the mind
to fasten itself,

THE BULL PEN
Now that the annual farce is over and the fraternity men have had a chance
to meet most of their pledges, we would like to ask, if you please, just what it’s all

about ?

Oh yes, the two weeks’ rushing season was much better than the longer

ones of previous years—cost is reduced and there is not as much time lost from
studies (and, incidentally, one can make the first show now that he is not obligated

to his fraternity’s rushing business).

But the thing remains a farce.

the future fraternity men and the future freshmen in the world.

We contend that

any fraternity wanting ten pledges should take ten pledge pins, meet the Rambler

at the station and pledge every third white man that steps off.

In this way hard

ANOTHER JOKE THAT’S NOT FUNNY
William Ingram sat comfortably asleep on his front porch in Camden, N. J.,
last Fourth of July, when, according to newspaper reports, a practical joker placed
a large firecracker between his teeth, lit the fuse and left hurriedly. When the
thing exploded, it blew all of Ingram’s front teeth out and left him in a serious

condition,

If that is a practical joke, then we hope that joker never gets mad at us.

You have mental strength, Bob; I’m
hoping you may grow in mental brav-

heart-and-brain friends—in like-mind-
ed fellows throughout the college—in
other fraternities or dormitories, and
even in professorial homes. Above all,
Bob, cultivate the art of grappling to
friends who keep you on your toes,
who leave you breathless now and
then, and perforce. make you some-
thing of a man. For half a dozen of
that breed are worth the hundreds we

know by name, and only by name.

There is another art, close-linked to

the art of making superlative friend-

ships. The fine art of the bull-session.

It is a demanding art, and like the
actor’s profession it cuts into one’s
evenings dreadfully. But by all means
become an adept therein. A bull ses-
sion, hotly contested, that leaves you
scowling pensively into the dark for
long before you drop off to sleep may
be bad for your health; but it builds
mental sinew. Z

You have a sense of humor, Bob, that
you must bring with you to college.
For sometimes you will swell over-
much with the vast import of new
ideas. And the sting of laughter is a
first-rate remedy for too much of that.

These, then, seek you, Bob: the habit
of eager) searching after the stuff to
build your own philosophy; the mental
bravery to defend your finished
temple; the knack of making price-
less friends; the gift of talking with
them when you find them; and a sav-
ing sense of humor. And all of these
to be found in four short but glorious
years!
