Lack of depth hurts Davidson at tournaments

By HOLME OLTROGGE

Wrestling captain Joe Binns led
the team in the Washington & Lee
and the Mid-South tournaments
over the past two weekends. In the
W2&L Invitational January 20 and
21, sophomore Binns lost the first
match but won the next three
handily to place third. But when
asked about his accomplish-
ments, he calmly waved off the
question and simply stated.that he
needed to lift and-run a lot more.

Wrestling

English or political science major

157 lbs (off season)

Binns started wrestling in ninth grade at Brookstone
High School in Columbus, Ga. In four years he became a
state champion with a 25-1 overall record. Currently the
captain of the Davidson team, he is the wrestler with the
most collegiate wrestling experience. At the January 20-21
Washington & Lee Invitational, Binns placed third, claim-
ing credit to 14 of the 18 team takedowns at that meet.
What made you wrestle in high school?

I made varsity as a freshman (in high school) since I was
the only one who could get down to 98 (pounds). I won the

first match but was pounded in the rest. I was one (win) and

ten (losses). You just couldn’t quit after that.

You appear to be a natural wrestler.

No. I’m not that strong, so I have to lift. I also have to run
a lot.

How has wrestling affected your academics?

It hasn’t. The daily practices and the weekend trips take
time, but I make it up.

At the W&L tournament, you had 14 out 18 takedowns.

I wrestle best on my feet. That’s just my style.

What is your favorite course at Davidson?

Music 101 with Swisher. He’s gotta be one of the best pro-
fessors here,

What are your hobbies?

1 like music. All music. I also like to waterski.

Whom do you most admire? :

Robert E. Lee. No really, it’s gotta be John Updike. Also,
I admire winners from schools like Davidson nt don’t
give scholarships.

What is your favorite movie?
“Clockwork Orange.” Ee read the book, but the movie
still beats it.

Who is your girlfriend?

I think I had better not say that...

How about a quote that you live by?

Peter Buss (142 pounds), Andy
Cook (167), Thomas Lane (190)
and Eric Farmer (Heavyweight)
did not fare as well. All lost both
matches of the double elimination
tournament. Buss was pinned bya
York wrestler who eventually
became the MVP of the tourna-
ment.

The fourth Davidson victory
was provided by freshman Chris
Clark (167), who went 1-2 for the
weekend.

The Mid-South Tournament on
January 27 and 28. proved a bit
more disheartening. The team
returned from Jefferson City,
Tenn. with only one team win.

The win again came from Binns °

who wrestled two weight classes
up from 134 pounds in the Wash-
ington and Lee tournament-to-150
at the Mid-South tournament. He
also lost a.0-1 match in overtime.

The team took only four wres-
tlers to the Mid-South meet. In

addition to Binns, the team con-
sisted of junior Pete Buss (142),
freshman Chris Clark (167) and
sophomore Eric Farmer (Heavy-
weight).

For the duration of the season,
the Cats will focus.on gaining
experience. “We will concentrate

on instructions and fun for the rest
of the meets,” said head coach

ing the squad’s last home match.

its sense as a male-only institution, citing
the football program’s relegation to Divi-
sion III as his prime example.

I doubt seriously that Davidson is “going
Ai. female.” Davidson may be considerably
Ai different today than it was in the 1950’s and
1960’s. But, then again, so is the world.

Traditionalism is not always a bad thing,
but when it causes such gross discrepancies
in treatment of individuals, it must be
condemned and the situation must be

Despite the belief that Davidson i is “‘ex-
ceptional,” the college must shirk its tradi-
tional image in the case of women’s athlet-

Davidson’ a binned panicies toatl be dis-
astrous for the college if the characteristic

Davidson lethargy prevents the admini-
stration from acting quickly.

Why, you ask? It seems that silly old
judicial system ruled that institutions must
give proportionate amounts in their budg-

"ets to women’s sports. That is, the amount
of money. spent per woman athlete must
equal the amount of money spent per male
athlete.

This is the infamous Title IX of the US
Civil Rights Act.

Now, if Davidson does not begin to act .
quickly on its athletic budget, an ugly
lawsuit will probably arise.

After all, if I were a woman athlete or -

coach at Davidson, I would have thought
long ago about suing the college for dis-
crimination. It looks like an open-and-shut

case, but then again I guess I am not look-

-ing at the “unique” nature-of Davidson.
Of course, neither will the courts.
