Clearing up rumors
about new eating houses

activities that do not “revolve
around the keg.” They too have
begun their rallying of student sup-
port.

“We have printed up pam-
phlets with information about our
house, have talked with various
groups regarding the proper proce-
dures, and have held several infor-
mal meetings,” said Hackett.

“The options for the Court are
so limited right now. We hope to
establish a house that caters to in-
dividuals who haven’t found their
niche on the court yet.

"We plan on having a stereo-
system dance floor as well as other
features that will make the house
attractive to members. It will also
be nice to have a place were both
sexes can eat together," Hackett
added. :

Holmes hopes that both houses

gain support among students.
Holmes stated, “Although neither
have been made official, I am op-
timistic that Patterson Court will
support the push for a new house.

"If it is possible, I would sup-
port both houses. However, this
would require 200 students, ex-
cluding freshmen, currently not
involved in the Court to express
interest,” Holmes explained.

Patterson Court President Julie
Petty said, “Patterson Court sup-
ports the concept of another eating
house, but not at the expense of
jeopardizing the existing houses.”

If anyone is interested in get-
ting involved with either of these
movements to provide more op-
tions for Patterson Court, call
Allison Sabel, for the women’s
house at 6030, or Jonathan Orr, for
the co-ed option, at 6353.

Students want earlier holidays

Break continued from page 1

The Faculty Executive Com-
mittee has been meeting with stu-
dent representatives to discuss the
problem.

Jennifer Humphrey, chair of
SGA’s Council on Academic Af-
fairs, asks “Where are the students
getting a fair shake in this?”

She says that the SGA asked
for another day in the exam sched-
ule; however, the dates in Decem-
ber were not what they envisioned.

Humphrey points out that the
week earlier in August this year
would have made the calender like
last year's. But she say faculty
would like a calendar that follows
moreclosely tothe Charlotte Meck-
lenburg schools, especially in light
of family vacation time. A later
start also allows for research pro-
grams and national conferences to
fall during summer break.

She sees two solutions. Either
we could have shorter semesters or
a definite cutoff date in December.
Accutoff date would push the start

of school back in August, but
Humphrey says that is preferable.
Students do not have the opportu-
nity to get jobs during the Christ-
mas rush and completely miss out
on the holiday build- up.
Although the faculty see the
extra exam day as optional, many
students do not have an option.
Honor council and SGA members
who have to pass out exams as well

as hall counselors and RA’s must
Stay at Davidson until the last day.

Humphrey is not hopeful:
“The Faculty Executive Commit-
tee is listening to student input, but
unfortunately nothing has
changed."

The faculty still seems unsure
of the opinion of the student body.
“Our feeling from all of these com-
plaints is that the student body
would rather start early,” says
McKelway. “It was unwise. We
thought that we were doing the
students a favor and we solved one
student problem by creating an-
other. To tell you the truth I have
no idea.”

FROM THE PCC

Whether or not a fourth eating house will participate in Self-
selection this January has been an important issue in the past several]
weeks. The Patterson Court Council feels it important to respond}
publicly to the issue and to clarify its role in the precess of Self-
selection and the addition of new Patterson Court houses:

As in previous years, freshwomen will list their first choice
affiliation and alternate houses in order of preference. These choices|
will be entered into a computer which places women in houses of their
preference until each house gains sixty members. At this point, waitin
lists will be started. In past years this:system has resulted in the vas
majority of freshwomen getting their first choice. Presently freshwome
will choose between the three existing houses: Connor, Rusk, and
Warner Hall.

In order for a new house to join the court, the interested persons}
must present forty signatures by upperclassmen who have committed!
to join as well as the group’s written by-laws to be submitted to PCC
for consideration. The Council votes and sends its recommendation to
the Council on Campus and Religious Life (CCRL) for further action,

At PCC’s November 7 meeting, a spokeswoman from a group
interested in starting a fourth women’s eating house presented ide.
for her proposed organization as well as evidence of some verbal
support from upperclasswomen. The PCC cannot make an officia
decision on the addition of a new house until it has received the
necessary materials (listed above), however, a preliminary vote 2

taken. PCC is not denying the possibility of a fourth house, but canno
give its support to the effort at this time. Until the Council has
determined the support for the organization, it cannot assess the
group’s impact on the existing court.

Bundy recalls mistakes of Vietnam

Vietnam continued from page 1

Foremost was

Vietnam’s determination, commit-
ment, and skill, which far surpassed
the United States’ expectations. In
short, Bundy stated, “The govern-
ment of North Vietnam cared
enough more, that they were bound
to win.”
Citing Dean Rusk, Bundy also
noted the administration’s overes-
timation of the American people,
both in terms of endurance and
conviction. Together, this imbal-
ance of determination was a cru-
cial factor in the war’s outcome.

Looking forward from the
early 1960s, many officials be-
lieved that U.S. support of the South
Vietnamese would work because
they had several unexpected suc-
cesses. Furthermore, critics and
proponents alike felt that Vietnam
was not a war from which the U.S.
could escape because a North Viet-
namese victory would produce a
“domino effect” of communist
takeovers, Bundy remembered.

. Consequently, the president’s
decisions involved how to repair
the growing problems within the
conflict, not about the U.S.’s pres-
ence. The picture both President
Kennedy and Johnson had was of
helping the South Vietnamese

le.

Ove Vietnam had been “placed
to one side” in 1964 because Presi-
dent Johnson focused his attention
on the election. By 1965 the ad-
ministration was forced to make
decisions because the U.S. had to
do more or lose, Bundy concluded.

After six months of increas-
ing difficulties in 1965, Johnson
decided to find a way of success-
fully remaining in Vietnam with-

North >

out interrupting the passage of his
Great Society legislation. So,
Bundy recalled, “ Johnson goes to
war without saying so.” Doing so,
he “makes unfortunate use of the
Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.”

This evasive measure cost the
President the Congress's and
people’s trust, and following the
disastrous Tet Offensive in 1967,
Johnson was voted out of office in
1968.
To analyze whether there was
a way to avoid such obstacles,
Bundy proposed how Kennedy
would have handled Vietnam had
he survived. Like Johnson,
Kennedy would have spent 1964
campaigning and not made Viet-
nam decisions until 1965.

Unlike Johnson however,
Kennedy would have stated,
“We're not going to desert these
people, but neither are we going to
take over their war.” While this
would have led tono different final
results, the United States would
have been spared the bulk of our
60,000 casualties, Bundy surmised.

Noting the Cold War attitude
which overestimated the “domino
effect” Vietnam would have had
on communist power, Bundy called
for today’s leftover Cold War hab-
its and attitudes to be “brushed
away so we can start afresh.”

Bundy also drew two major
lessons from the Vietnam experi-
ence: the President must always
inform Congress and the Ameri-
can public of his or her opinion on
foreign policy matters and beready
to explain it; and administrations
“have to not get caught in by suc-
tion” and instead examine each
situation se; ly, including the
foreign players’ commitment in
relation to the American

population’s attitude.

College.-talks
about next
Dean of
Students

By Rachel Dunifon

Last Wednesday, students,
faculty and staff gathered in Vail
Commons to discuss what they
want in a new Dean of Students.
The dinner was one of the SGA-
sponsored Roundtable Discus-
sions, held throughout the year and
open to everyone.

Dr. Bruce Jackson of the Math
Department heads the search com-
mittee commissioned to find anew
Dean of Students by this spring.
He informed the dinner group of
the progress that his committee
has made, which thus far has in-
volved writing a complete descrip-
tion of the Dean’s job. According
to Jackson, this is not a simple task,
as the Dean’s job encompasses
many more aspects of campus life
than just the realm of students.

As discussion turned to what
Davidson needs in a new Dean of
Students, several issues were
raised. While it was unanimous
that the person selected should be
a good administrator, as well as
able to relate to students, parents,
faculty and staff, other points saw
less agreement.

Debate among students re-

volved around whether it should
bea priority to ensure that the new.
Dean of Students is someone who
has had personal contact with
Davidson in the past.. Same stu-
dents feel that this is necessary to
guarantee that the person under-
stands Davidson’s tradition, in-
cluding the importance of the
Honor Code.

Others believe, as Davidson
has changed so drastically over the
last years, that a person who is
tied-down to an image of the
Davidson of the past would not
reflect the interests of current
Davidson students. Many students
feel that the appointment of a new
Dean of Students is a symbolic
move, and one that should reflect
the changing face of Davidson’s
student body.

Dr. Jackson and other mem-
bers of the committee emphasized
their focus on finding the best per-
son for the job, without conform-
ing to a preconceived image of
who this person should be. They
also encouraged students, faculty
and staff to give any input or opin-
ions that they might have about the
search to members of the commit-
tee, who will begin interviewing
next semester.

The committee members are:
Bruce Jackson, Julio Ramirez,
Vivien Dietz, Janet Shannon,
DeVane Tidwell, Eric Rosenbach,
Sarah Orsbon, Julie Petty, Jeff
Frank, and Lisa Combs.
