“Culture shock” is a term
used to describe what ha

— ripe Old World so-

diarrhea and _ disillusion-

the first week, but is never
completely eradicated.

In a state of culture shock,

A club, through which
Americans might meet
French students interested
in America, has been organ-

The Davidson group of 12
students forms the Ameri-

students in American civili-

at the University provide
the French nucleus,

and objective viewpoint, reports French professor Dr.
Joe O. Embry, chairman of Davidson’s foreign study
program.

Basic requirements include at least a “B’’ (2-0)
average through the second-year level in the lan-
guage of the country in which a student would ‘
to study and an overall average of at least 1.75.

Embry explains that in addition to these basic
requirements, each student must submit a written
recommendation from a faculty member to verify
that he is sufficiently motivated to study inde-
pendently.

Embry also notes that the Davidson plan is
rather unusual among foreign study programs, since
the American student leads virtually the same life
as that of a native European student.

The Davidson students live among people of
the country, either in dormitories or in private
homes, and thus would need at least a basic work-
ing knowledge of the language of the country. Da-
vidson students also attend the regularly scheduled
classes at the university and often do. independent
travel: on their own.

The accompanying Davidson professor has fre-
quent meetings with the students and conducts a
seminar course in the literature of the country that
makes up for the lack of personal contact among
students and professors in foreign universities.

The particular seminar course conducted by
the Davidson professor is the only one especially
planned for the Davidson group. All the other
courses that a student takes are chosen by the stu-
dent himself, in consultation with his faculty ad-
visor and the Davidson professor accompanying the
group.

Embry indicated that the Junior Year Abroad is
more than an academic experience—the total experi-
ence is intended to be one of life-long reward both
to the individual student and to Davidson College.
