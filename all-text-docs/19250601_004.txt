MEMORIES

ITH our college course safely behind |

us, we look in a sufter light on the

experiences through which we have
passed, on the events and happenings of our |
stay on the Davidson campus.

We see once more’in a golden light our
first introduction to Davidson, and to its |
traditions and customs. The sea of un-
known but kindly faces which greeted us at
the station, the bags and suitcases which we
carried to the campus for numerous upper-
classmen, the lost feeling, which soon wore
off as we grew accustomed to our new home, |
all come back to us fresh in memory. |

The paddlings which we received, the
errands which we ran, the fresh caps which
we wore lose their unpleasant side and seem
to make up a necessary part of our happi-
nes as Freshmen, for undoubtedly we were
happy. The first classes in the large bare
tooms in old Chambers, the chapel exercises
every morning, the Chambers bell which
woke us from our sleep every morning, are
all memories. :

The Chambers fire was the big event in
our first year, one of the big events of our
life. During the rest of that year we were
handicapped in our studies by overcrowding,
but in memory we see only the closer friend-
ships brought about, the joys of college life.

The Soph Banquet marked the passing of
our second year. As a toastmaster, Piggy
Martin was unbeatable, and to no event of
college days can we look back with more
pleasant feelings. It was the first under-
taking of the whole class, as a class, and it
drew us closer to each other.

The next year came Junior Week with its
festivities and happy times. Now Com-
mencement is with us and we are come to
the end of our four years together. We have
only a wealth of memories of the four years
but we have formed friendships which will
last through life.

Football, baseball, basketball, water fights,
bull sessions, and bumming have all come in
their season during these years and have left
pleasant memories. We have been defeated
in athletic contests, but we have won great
victories, and after all, the thing that counts
the most. Davidson teams have always
played the game.

We are leaving to enter the game of life.
If we play the game fairly and squarely, |
success awaits us. Wherever we go, we
have our college! friendships to help us, and
pleasant memories of four of the happiest
years of our lives, to strengthen us when
~-things seem to be going wrong.

- May we always keep fresh and green,
memories of Davidson, and of Twenty-five!

‘Eighty-three of the two hundred and four
iO. entered inthe fall of 1921 re-

“the recognition as- graduates of

CLASS SONG

Twenty-five, we rise to hail thee!
Sweet we hold thy name;
Deeply shall we ever love thee,
Loud thy praise proclaim.

Ever onward, Twenty-Five!
Falter not nar fail; ’
At the goal success awaits thee,
Hail to thee, all hail!

Twenty-five, to D. C. faithful
Through the passing years;
Stronger grow the ties that bind us
As our parting nears.

Twenty-five! O rise to greet her;
Rise, each loyal son!
Be for her your treasured trophies,
All your laurels won.

W. W. P. and J. M. W.

A MEMORIAL

In the campaign for the rebuilding of
Chambers, the class of ’25 subscribed over
seven and a quarter thousands of dollars.
At the time of the campaign, any man or
group who contributed five thousand to the
campaign, was given the right to dedicate a
room in the new building,

In the fall of ’21, Ralph Lancaster of our
class died, leaving an ache in the hearts of
his clasmates and friends. He is the only
member of our class who has been called in-
to the great beyond during our college life.
As a class, we should memoralize his mem-
ory in some way.

What could be more suitable than the
dedication of a class room in Chambers to
his memory? So far only a little over a
third of the ’25 subscriptions has heen paid.
Three years of the five during which sub-
scriptions were to be paid, have lapsed, and
only a third of the money has heen paid, But
the next two years will be different. We
will be making money instead of paying it
out for an education.

Can we not pay up our subscriptions and
leave a room, dedicated to the memory of
one of us, who has gone before us to his
reward?

The little three letter word, that the

one who provides us with the necessities of life,

means,

who sacrifices much that is dear to him, so as to
give us a few of luxuries and pleasures of the
world, who toils hard and worries over numerous
problems of which we are not aware, and who
looks to us to hold sacred the good name which
he has given us and has charged us to pass on
to future: generations.

But what does Dad mean to us: Do we mere-
ly use Dad as a good thing, a bank account
when we need money, as a judge when we need
council, as a support when we need aid? Or is
Dad our best friend, is he the one to whom we
tell our innermost secrets, with whom we’ con-
fide our greatest desires, whose advice we seck
and abide by.

Dad is the best Pal we have and one who will
encourage us on our voyage across the rocks of
the world.

Clip out the following verses fellows and send
them in your next letter to Dad. He’ll appreciate
it more than you think,

Move on, each one, to fill his place. The call
To serve will you not heed?

This exh6rtation o’er, a fond adieu

TO DAD

Old Pal, if you don’t understand
The things that I may do,

Be merciful in what you thnk,
For I but follow you.

And if I slip a step, mayhaps,
Or lose sight of your track,
Remember, Dad, I follow on,—O
It's only strength I lack.

Remember, now is just the chance
To cheer me on my trip;

I pray you, speak a helpful word,—
Don't watch with silent lip.

My road is long, my time is short—
Smile on me while you can,

As I tread the beaten ways,
And try to be a man.

And when IT walk the crowded streets,
So far away from home,
I'll always think of my Pal, Dad,
And know I'm not alone.
—C. B. W.

IN THE AFTERGLOW

Mother o’ mine, in the afterglow 6
Of mothering years, I love you so;

For loving me ere life I knew,

When next your heart a new life grew.

Loving me on into fair childhood,

When I so little understood

The long, hard way we all must go,

Mother o’ mine, I love you so.

Loving me, when life so sweet

Tempted my wayward childish feet

Away from paths of truth and right

To paths that lead to sin’s dark night;
Winning me back with loving tone

To ways that you had made your own,

By struggle and stress and pain and prayer;
By love’s own cords held me there.

Mother o‘ mine, 'tis mine to take

The burdensome load, the stress, the ache
That come in motherhood’s fair years

The joy, the pain, the love, the tears;

‘Tis mine to give you what you gave me.
Mother of mine, I would faithful be

To the highest note in the song you taught
My childish lips, the music fraught

With all the mother hopes and tears

That fill to brim the mothering years.

Mother o’ mine, in the afterglow

Of motherhood's years, I thank you so

For gifts to me from out your heart,

At thoughts that rise my hot tears start;
God give me-ways to make you know
How great is my love before you go
Away to rest from your mothering;

I would remove life’s every sting,

And give you rest in the afterglow,

For, mother o' mine, I love you so.

dial wishes for success along every line. We
