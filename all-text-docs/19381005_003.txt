Jack Holland, Junior:
For many years the Davidson

campus has been highly touted for
its Wildcat Spirit. To every fresh-
man about to enter Davidson this
so-called Wildcat Spirit sounds ex-
tremely attractive; the
period of orientation, he sees him-
self as part of this spirit. Then in
week with the arrival of |
the upperclassmen and rush week,
his interest in the Wildcat Spirit is
diverted and begins to wane.

Strange Levite Order
Has Debut On Campus

Mystic Society Advocates “No
Hair-Cut Till Thanks-

giving” Movement

IDEA SWEEPS COUNTRY

The ancient and honorable order
of Levi has at last become an ac-
tual fact upon this fair Davidson
campus. For many years the school
was mercifully free from the ac-

ms of this nefarious group, but
now we find it sweeping the cam-
pus like wild-fire under the foul
auspices of Marvin Sink, Harry
Suttonficld, and’ Bobby McClelland.

It is rumored that Levi Sutton-
field inaugurated the Wildcat chap-
ter with Old Mother Hubbard's
pretty daughter as his chief inspir-
ation, Although we have no actual
proot of Levi's many escapades, the
actress’ little sister did mention
in passing that one Levi Goldberg,
alias Handsome Harry Suttonfield,
had been trifling with her affec-
tions

Vo the society has not held
an official meeting, but several
men are in line for high positions.
Bob MeClelland, “Fireman Bob”
to his many admirers, will un-
doubtedly achieve the honor of
High Priest, while Handsome Har-
ry is content to be the power be-
hind the throne as Vice-Priest,
Seribe, and Chairman of the Ex-
chequer. “Hairless Joe” Shelton
seeilis a good prospect for the
synonymous offices of dog-catcher
and cook, with “Jiving Jim” Mce-
Donald announcing watery raiders
with his trumpet. Leviticus Sink
originated the only ideal of “No
hair-cut until Thanksgiving” when
the Levites will feast on the fruits
of “Hairless. Joe's” labors. %

Every. effective type face is a
potential salesman for work which
is not judged by its price alone.

Some people are. born great,
others make themselves great, and
the, rest of ‘em grate upon others.

utterly new kind of writing ink—called Quink—
