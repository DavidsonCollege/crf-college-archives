Goals Committee hears college needs

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Staff Writer

Davidson will celebrate its
150th birthday in 12 years. The
Trustee’s Development Com-
mittee establishedlast February
a committee composed of
students, faculty, ad-
ministrators, and. trustees to
project goals the college should
work toward meeting by 1987.

Trustee Fred Stair, chairman
of the Goals Committee,
suggested that the committee
work in three areas to ac-
complish its tasks. At the
beginning of a meeting Wed-
nesday evening, he said that
the committee should work to
develop a succinct theme for
1987, state the goals implicit
within this. theme, and finally,
set priorities in accomplishing
these goals.

Earlier Wednesday afternoon
the Goals Committee held a
public- hearing to gather in-
formation about the varied con-
cerns of the college com-
munity. The meeting was at-
tended by individuals represen-
ting diverse interests at David-
son, but most of their ex-
pressions of concern may be
classified’ into three in-
terlocking areas: the quality of
life at. Davidson, facilities at.
Davidson, and the college’s
academic program.

The putpose of the evening
meeting was to analyze com-
ments made by the individuals
at the hearing. Despite . this
stated objective and Stfair’s
opening statements, the Goals
Committee was unclear about
its purpose or usefulness: until
near the close of the meeting.

A discussion of quality of life
at Davidson ran intermittently
throughout the public hearing
and touched on the subjects of
lack of money for social func-
tions, student-faculty relation-
ships, and student services
such as construction .of an
adequate infirmary and im-
proved psychological coun-
seling for students.

Sophomore _ Marc Menchel |
explained that the Union does
not have adequate funds to
sponsor big-name en-
tertainment groups throughout
the year. Junior Dan Thorp ex-
presed concern over the

general quality of life at David- |

‘son, and specifically protested
the cancélation of funds for the

lecture series and the artist
series next year.

Concerning  student-faculty
relationships, Professor of
Philosophy George Abernethy

commented, ‘‘We ought to be -

reducing the student-faculty

ratio from one to 13 to one to 10
‘or one to 11...You’re basically

going to have to decide whether
you’re interested in expanding
or interested in improving the
quality you have.

Vice-President for Academic
Affairs John Bevan cautioned
that latching onto student-
facilty ratios is an inadequate
way to measure relationships.
‘Students should see in
professors the quality of life
that the liberal arts traditions
purports.’’ he added.

According to Junior Mark

Wilensky, many of the
buildings on campus do not
meet safety standards. He
cited the Martin Chemistry
Building and the lack of fire
doors in Love Auditorium as

-examples.

Both students and faculty
were concerned about
inadequate facilities, especially
for chemistry students, . art
students, and in athletics.

Professor of Art Herb Jackson
said: that the art department
cannot operate satisfactorily
within its present facilities.
“There will be no Davidson
National after next year under
present circumstances, ” he
added.

Director of Athletics Thomas

Cartmill said, ‘‘Johnston
am is for the entire student

body. We’re looking for a

.facility that could encompass

varsity, intramural, and
physical education activities.”
Others present advised that the
womens athletics program
especially needs improvement.
Professor of Chemistry
Ralph Gable advised that
Davidson should evaluate its
academic program. Gable said
that the college is moving

‘toward more individualized in-

struction and research and that

such methods of instruction are

“tremendously — expensive.”
Concerning the future, Gable
added that Davidson must ask
itself, ‘What will we be ex-
pecting from students and what
will they be expecting from
us?’’

Professor of English Gill

Holland proposed that in-
terdepartmental major
programs be formulated and
that the college seriously
should consider publishing a
literary journal comparable to
the Sewanee Review or Shenen-
doah.

Abernethy commented ~ that
Davidson has an “unparalleled
opportunity since 1940” to im-
prove the academic quality of
its faculty. He advised that a
full-time Dean of the Faculty
be appointed to seek out new
and promising faculty mem-
bers

Abernethy also suggested
that Davidson initiate an in-
tensive program to recruit
students from lower-class

Senate retains Kline for legal assistance,
Determines three general priority areas

By MARK GERGEN
Staff Writer

The Senate voted to retain
the law firm of Cannon -and
Kline to assist with the Bill of
Rights in Tuesday’s meeting.

Rick Kline was present at the
meeting to answer questions.
He stated, ‘It’s my -un-
derstanding that your principal
concern is with a student Bill of

Rights. It appears to me that —

you are loking for  draf-
tsmanship and a general legal

background.”
Kline added that he could

provide this. He stated that he

didn’t have any specific ex-
perience in this area, but he
could not see any difficulties.
Former SGA President Blain
Butner stated that there was a
need for outside legal assistan-

ce. He specifically mentioned

that the College’s lawyer,

vantages are that he is close
and available right now...His
problems are that he doesn’t
have that: much experience and
he is going to need student
help. ”

Other . firms studied were
Blum and Sheely, who were
turned down last week; Gasey
and Daley, and Louis Lesaine.

The resolution was passed 11-
2-0. The provisions were a $250
Salary plus expenses.

Steve Smith reported that a
recent student questionaire
distributed to 150 students at
random elicited only seven
responses. The Senate passed a
resolution stating the goals the
Senate thought were most im-
portant.

Improvements were called
for in three basic areas. First,
general endowment for
scholarships, faculty salaries
and research. Second,

Larry. J. Dagenhart was “adequate academic programs-

presently providing assistance.
He added, ‘‘When you consider
anything ‘like this it is impor-

tant to have input from more;

than one person.”

Butner went on to: state, .

“Larry Dagenhart is a very

good lawyer; but he is the
College’s-lawyer. Somebody '

like Rick (Kline) would
more to our leaning.”’

Bo Baskin reported on
alternative choices. Baskins
stated, ‘‘Mr. Kline’s

be

ad;

specifically in Art and
Chemistry. Third, an im-
provement in the quality of life

‘at Davidson, specifically in the

areas of the College Union,
adequate on-campus housing,
and athletics.

The Senate failed to pass a
budget request due to a loss of
quorum. This came beforé a
decision on counseling and
whether the Senate should hire

‘Amelia Dockery for one cid a

week.

Senators absent-Bill Clark,
Bill Green, John Guthrie, Tom
Iones, Bob Palmer, Patty
Phillips and Tony Snow. It was
the third meeting Clark has
missed and the second for
Green, Guthrie, Iones, and

Snow. Holt Foushee. was
present, but he has also missed
two.

In other actions Randy
‘Sherill .managed to become

SGA President John Munce —Scott Buell

Senator for Richardson Dorm.
There was no opposition.
Brad Swallwell reported on

.the Senate’s budget request

going to the Campus Tax Coun-
cil. The request is a decrease of
$330 from last year. The
elimination of the Course
Evaluation Handbook and a
large reduction in the Speaker
Fee were responsible for the
decrease.
