The SecondTimeAround

Anyone not thoroughly confused
over the status of Monday’s constitu-
tional referendum probably does not
understand what has happened. A
number of questions over the legality
of the vote on the student regulations
court has brought the Student Coun-
cil to hold a second referendum.

Elsewhere on this page. there ap-
pears a letter from Mr. Hugh J. Beard
Jr., alleging that the procedure used
for authorizing the court was out of
ordér and invalid.

We agree with Mr. Beard on one
point: The amendment. was very gen-
erally worded. so that the voter had
little idea, from merely reading the
ballot. of what the proposed court
wottld consist of or how it would func-
tion.

Paul Marion. who will head the
court next year. has explained that
to reproduce on the ballot all of the
changes the court will entail would
have necessitated reprinting a con-
siderable portion of the Student Body
Constitution, because of a number of
minor changes in wording.

Though we believe Monday's vote
to be legal, the ballot could have
been improved considerably by a
short explanation of the essential de-
tails of the makeup of the court, par-
ticularly something of how members

would be chosen, without necessitat- -

ing reproducing all of the cumber-
some details of slight word changes.

. Even if the voter had been fully
informed of the nature of the changes
prior to the voting, a point far from
certain, he deserved to be confronted
with more details than the mere blank
check to the Council to establish a
student regulations court.

Step Carefully

One of the foremost charges ban-
died around in the fraternity contro-
versy which has vexed Davidson with
varying amounts of intensity over the
past year has been the allegation that
there exists no realistic alternctive to
fraternities.

Such a charge is obviously true
and equally obviously undesirable;
yet, before last spring’s eruption little
had been done in this direction. True,
a group of Independents had organ-
ized Lingle Manor, but its organization
and facilities were such that it was not
an effective substitute for fraternities.

Since last spring, there has been
talk of establishing eating clubs hav-
ing virtually the same facilities as do
fraternities:. the college agreed last
spring to finance two such houses
should adequate interest be shown.
But the movement fell short and little
has been heard of the idea since.

But a small group of Independents
and faculty members have been-quiet-

In addition, the handling of the
voting procedure itself was far from
ideal. Ordinarily the procedure of
voting on constitutional questions has
previously been to open polls during
specified hours. The only previous
:ttempt to hold a referendum vote in
chape. ended up as a farce in which
a second vote was necessitated.

While the constitution admitted-
ly establishes no set voting procedure,
we. think it obvious that ballots being
handed out in chapel, with no record
kept of who has voted, opens the door
to the possibility of irregularities.

In addition, with no advance no-
tice of what procedure was to be
used, students absent from chapel
were systematically denied a right
to vote. With only four assemblies
remaining in the year, the number
absent constituted a considerable per-
centage of the student body.

The Council is now going to hold
a second referendum on the question,
in order to erase any doubt about the
validity of the new court.

’ Due to the fact that no chapels
remain after Monday and the Coun-
cil does not meet until Monday night,
a voluntary assembly of the student
body will be held Tuesday, for the
exact changes proposed in the Consti-
tution to be read, in toto. Then, a
vote will be held on the following
Monday, with the use of polling places
at certain definite times.

We regret the Council’s having to
go through such elaborate procedures
for a measure which is apparently op-

osed by few members of the student

ody. But the second vote will at
least clear the air and end all specu-
lation as to the court’s legality.

ly working all year to try to drum up
support. Up to now, they have been
hesitant to say anything concrete, for
fear of their pronouncement being
premature and ending in a replay of
last springs episode.
But the group has now decided
to appeal to the student body for sup-
port, in hopes of arriving at a firm
basis on which to begin the new year
in the fall. They have the ideas and
leadership, but without a substantial
number of students who are willing
to support the venture ‘financially,

they will not be able to gain college

backing for building a house.

A number of disgruntled students
have been quick to criticize the fra-
ternity system without being willing
to work for an alternative solution.
Now, thev have a readv-made situa
tion which merely needs their inter-
est and. financial support.

This is the chance for the David-
son. social system to take a giant step
forward—we hope it doesn’t stumble.

The New Look Revisited

Several weeks ago, on the occa-
sion of the completion of the evaiua-
tion of fraternity life by the Social
Life Evaluation Committee. we called
for a “new look” in Davidson's fra-
ternities.

One of the main points of the
committee’s report was found in its
pointing to the predominant role fra-
ternities play in campus social life.
Therefore, the committee said, in ex-
change for this virtual hegemony, fra-
ternities must be willing to assume
some responsibility for campus social
life until a viable substitute is found.

The fraternities made a signifi-
cant step in this direction with the
adoption of a policy this week of open-
ing afterparties to Independents.

No one argued that the on-cam-
pus combo affairs, sponsored by the
Social Council, approached being any-
thing like a substitute for off-cam-
pus fraternity parties. The spec-
tacle of less than 20 people attend-
ing a function costing several hun-

dred dollars is ridiculous and imprac-
tical.

And so long as faculty rules re-
main as they are, there is little pros-
pect for support for said Social Coun-
cil affairs improving. As a result, In-
dependents have been faced with a
distinct void in social life during
dance weekends. And at the same
time, the Social Council was spend-
ing money paid by the entire student
body for entertainment used by only
a small percentage of students. *

The old situation, due to cir-

-cumstances beyond the control of the

Social Council, satisfied no one. Hope-
fully, the new policy of the fraterni-
ties will help to alleviate the Indepen-
dents’ problem considerably and at
the same time improve the overall.
campus social life, by diverting more
money to programs which can be en-
joyed by the entire campus.

We commend the fraternities for
their forward looking action and hope
that it will open a new chapter in
fraternity life here.

Beard Questions Changes In Co

Dear Editor:

Last Monday, April 25, 1966,
the Davidson Student Council
submitted to the student body in
chapel a proposed amendment
to the Student Body Constitu-
tion. granting to the Student
Council ‘‘. . . authority to make
necessary constitutional changes
... in order to establish a Stu-
dent Body Regulations Court,
which amendment fundamental-
ly alters the structure of Student
Government at Davidson.

Previous to that Chapel. it
was assumed that the Student
Body at Davidson was sufficient-
ly intelligent and competent to
amend their own Constitution. I
shall not discuss the merits of
this assumption either in theory
or in practice, but rather I feel
it necessary to point out. that it
was embodied implicitly in Ar-
ticle 1—Purpose, and in Article
IlI—Authority, and explicitly in
Article XI, Section 2. Amend-
ments.

In submitting this amendment
to the Student Body. the Student
Council implicitly denied this as-
sumption. The establishment of
a Student Body Regulations
Court by constitutional means
would have required the amend-
ment of three sections of the
present constitution, and the ad-
dition of perhaps two articles,
concerning the Court itself and
the Summer Regulations Court.
I believe that this is not so com-
plicated: as not to permit its con-
sideration by the Student Body.

In any event, I do not see the
reason for this highly irregular
action by the Student Council.
Any student who would not be
able to comprehend the amend-
ment would probably accept the
recommendation of the Student

‘67, A Free Season

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Council.

Indeed, if the rejection of the
proposal is feared by the Student
Council, this procedure must be
considered to be even more ques-
tionable.

The amendment adopted Mon-
day, however, is not sufficient
to enable the Student Council to
amend in any way or for any
purpose the Student Body Con-
stitution. Article XI, Section 2.,
of the Student Body Constitution
provides that ‘A two-thirds vote
of those present and entitled to
vote shall be necessary for an
amendment to be adopted.”* This
section remains unrepealed and
also uneffected by the vote Jast
Monday.

1 would probably vote for the
adoption of the amendments
concerning the establishment of
the Regulations Court, but I shall
be damned if I do not get a
chance to judge for myself.

Explain Vote

Dear Editor:

In reply to any misunderstand-
ing concerning Monday's Stu-
dent Body vote on the Student
Body Regulations Court: the
manner in which it was conduct-
ed is perfectly legal and consti-
tutional. The Student Body has
the right to empower the Stu-
dent Council with the authority
to establish a Student Body Reg-
ulations Court.

The constitutional changes,

which the student council . ap-
proves, however, will not go in-
to effect until they are approved
by a two-thirds vote of the Stu-
dent Body, as the amendment

procedure requires.

Dear Editor:

1 am delighted to receive crit-
icism. hostile or friendly, and
praise, sincere or insincere, but
only when I deserve them. It
has been called to my attention
that-I am receiving criticism.
hostile. for the anonymous ob-
servations: about the effects of
the new factory on the Social
and economic life of Davidson,
carried in THE DAVIDSONIAN
two weeks ago. I wish to state
that I am not the anonymous
professor who made those state-
ments.

I am happy to make this an-
nouncement, for now the conver-

club affairs can turn from un-
important subjects like United
States involvement in Viet Nam,
civil rights in Davidson, et. al..
to the important matter of spec-
ulating on the identity of said
professor.

This letter does not even im-
ply criticism of the professor.
Anonymity is a matvelous thing
and its use must be defended
and protected, when such use
does not harm any individual,
for it frees one from restrictions
on freedom of speech, and, more
important, it protects one from
anonymous phone calls from the
mentally sick, who reside in ev-
ery community.

Smoot Big Hit AtHungry D

A Review

Fred Smoot came home this
week.

Smoot, star of the latest and
most daring venture of the Hun-
gry D Restaurant, which inciden-
tally now boasts a. capital ‘‘D”
in its name. won the hearts of
students and townspeople alike
in his latest appearance at Da-
vidson.

Introduced by Union President
Peter Parrott ‘as Davidson's
“resident comedian,’ Smoot im-
mediately established rapport
with his audience with his ren-
dition of ‘Joe Cool when the
Tab Arrives.”

Monday’s audience, composed
of a surprisingly large number
of faculty and administration and
relatively few students, could
identify with Joe Cool's reaction
of blowing his cool when he looks
at the check—most of the audi-
ence had just finished their own
meal, Hungry D style.

The inimitable Smoot. stand-
ing about 5 feet 4. went into a
series of imitations of heroes
with a selection wide enough to
please the most demanding au-
dience. From Douglas Fair-
banks Sr., complete with silent
movies for the oldsters, he went
to a rendition of modern west-
erns, including a takeoff on
The Winning of the West, com-
plete with the Hippy Indians,
who accuse the white man, hol-
ed up in his circled wagons, of
being ‘‘White Finks.”

In the same act, Smoot, using
his wide repertoire of voices.
portrays “History's Greatest
Shootout.”’ pitting the rough.and-
tumble gunfighter Tumbleweed
against a sweet-talking dude
who wears pink boots, winks at
Tumbleweed and accuses him of
stealing his lambs and _ chick-
ens.”

The old master of the facial
expression and sound effect al-
so threw in, just for good meas-

ure. a couple of routines that the
Davidson student may recog-
nize, but is not likely to.tire
of—'‘Paul Revere’s Ride’’ and
the “Roller Coaster.”

Finally, near the end of his
second show, he pulled his audi-
ence into the act and called for

requests. His hilarious rendi-
tions of a toothbrush and birth
control pills, the type that work
and the type that don’t, brought
the house down, to top off a re-
ally professional-type night club
in the New Look of the Morrison
Room.

Davidson Fraternities

Imitate One

Editor’s Note: In the ex-
cerpted letter below, William
E. Le Clere, a national offi-
clal of Chi Psi Fraternity and
guest speaker at Davidson's
annual pledge banquet on
April 4,. comments on David-
son’s Social Life Evaluation
Committee Report. Fraternity
Maison officer Tom Covington
sent him the report several
weeks ago.

**. . Page four of the report
seems to hit at the problem in
rather neat terms. There the
committee speaks of the diffi-
culty for the man who does not
‘fit in’ as evidenced by his re-
jection by the fraternity system.
This is the nub of the matter,
and it suggests several short-
comings at Davidson, both with-
in and without the system. To a
great extent, there is oniy one
slot to ‘fit into’ at Davidson.

“It is my impression that the
fraternities there tend:to imitate,
to a'marked degree, one anoth-
er. This points up one potential
way in which some aspects of
the problem may be alleviated,
if my assumption of chapter im-
itation is a correct one. That
would be for several chapters at
Davidson to consciously begin to
establish a distinctive character
which would break out of the
‘old molds.’

os

Under the section en-

Another’

titled The Role of Fraternities,
I would have wished that the
committee. could have altered its
terminology concerning the re-
linquishing of fraternities ‘long-'
standing rights of selection.’ I
continue to be persuaded that
the immediate device of total so-
cial membership for all who de-
sire it at Davidson is mierely a
temporary expedient to buy some
time for the college community
there to develop some better al-
ternatives. I had hoped that the
committee would spell this out,
Otherwise, it will be all too easy,
four or five years from now,
when the total social opportunity
device has had some tough sail-
ing. to chalk up another ‘frater-
nity failure’ to this system. This
is precisely what happened at
Williams, (among other things).

“The more I look back upon
my impressions of fraternities
at Davidson, the more con-
vinced I become that one of the
basic problems there is that the
college has been entirely too gen-
érous in its support of fraterni-
ties, through the building of the
fraternity court. This, coupled
with such an obvious total de-
pendence upon the fraternities
to provide the social life for
the community makes it rather
remarkable, in a way, that the
fraternity men are as respon-
sible, and responsive, as they
seem to be today... .”

Co-eds Praise
D.C. Gentlemen

Dear Editor:

After reading reports of Spring
Frolics Weekend in THE DA-
VIDSONIAN, we have come to
the conclusion that. Davidson is
high camp.

The parties, entertainment,
concerts, alcoho! consumption
and free. flow of coins make Da-
vidson the jdeal attraction for a
weekend away.

Since “Virginia Gentlemen” no
longer prove to meet the stand-
ards set forth by that venerable
Mr. Jefferson, we, as students
of Mary Washington College of

nstitution

the University of Virginia. have
found ourselves faced with the
dilemma (sic) of seeking the
true symbol of southern male
hospitality.

Realizing that this honor no
longer rests with our brother
school. we would like to extend
our hospitality to the gentlemen
of Davidson College.

Please don't misunderstand
our intentions — we love our
home state of Virginia, but be.
ing the globetrotters that we are
we wish to extend our horizons.

we are both suitcase colleges,

SAYONARA: Part |!

Seniors always know how things should have
been done. We have the great gift of hindsight. Be-
fore we came in September of 1962, Davidson was a
solid white group of students; the old fraternity sys-
tem reigned unchallenged so that the fraternities
ran the world outside the classroom. Everything was
pretty well homogeneous. Now we are about to leave
a school in these ways drastically changed. Most
changes have been for the better—there are a few
more important ones we need to make, all of us at

Davidson.
e s s

A SMALL BAND unique to Davidson will largely
ass with our class. Our own little versions of Berk-
ley and the Village—our small band of campus rad-
icals. Most of them rather shallow intellectually and
proud of it, seemingly preferring the flamboyant to
the more practical, short on tolerance and long on
real concern in spite of themselves—but we owe a
lot to these men, long hair and all.

These concerned men brought many needed
shocks to our complacency. Their arrogance often
shocked or stung many of us into rebuttal and with
that comes the dawn of thought, hopefully. And
wasn’t it disconcerting to conclude that often they
were right in spite of themselves!

I salute these men. If nothing else (and there
was much more than this) they taught us all toler-
ance. Davidson needs a circle of campus radicals,
complete with long hair and beards.

OUR SOCIAL STRUCTURE’S MAIN PROBLEM
probably is not the problem of exclusion and rejec-
tion and whether fraternities should exist or domi-
nate or be intellectually oriented and whatnot. Our ©
social structure’s chief concern is the integration of
our Negro classmates into our social lives. At the
present time I could not honestly say to Charlie Scott
or any Negro that he should choose Davidson over
most larger colleges and universities.

A Negro student seriously concerned about his
education can get a good one here—or just about
anywhere else he goes. What the Negro student can-
not get here is the benefit of what is traditionally
called the “college experience.” Most of the students
will neat keep him completely out of the so-
