pointed out that only by the cohesion of
the younger Democrats could the national
party be held together in the future. He
also made clear that this is not an unique
club but is similar to many others being
formed or already formed throughout the
colleges of the United States,

The president continued and urged all
the members present to enroll as many
men as they possibly could. He stated
that if a man is a Democrat it is not
necessary for him to be approached by
one of the members of the club—all he
has to do is to seek out one of the mem-
bership committee as given above and re-
quest him to give to him a membership
card. This card, furnished by the Na-
tional Democratic Headquarters, reads as
follows:

In connection with the formation of this
club it is noted that the students of the
college have twice given their support to
Governor Smith, once in the straw vote
held last spring and the second time in the
straw vote held this fall, both of the con-
tests being supported by “The David-
sonian.””

DR. THOMPSON TO SPEAK
TO MINISTERIAL BAND
Dr. Taliaferro Thompson is

scheduled to speak to the Min-

isterial Band Sunday afternoon,

2:30, in Shearer Hall. _A double

purpose can be fulfifield in this

meeting. The ministerial stu-
dents will have an opportunity
to get in closer touch with Dr.

Thompson than would other-

wise be possible; have advantage

of practical advice of one who

has had much experience in
training ministers; and it can
help the student in his choice of

seminaries. The officers of the
ministerial organization urge
that every member be present.

The Sad Widow Speaks Up

An Altamont man died the other
day and the preacher was dispensing
the salve that is usually spread during
a funeral sermon. In the course of the
sermon he said, “the deceased was
torn from the arms of his loving wife,
who thus is left a lonely, disconsolate
widow at the darly age of 25 years”—
“Twenty-two if you please,” sobbed

SENIORS HOLD
FORTH AT.
FIRST “SMOKER”

Social Function Held by Lenoir
Class in Maxwell-Chambers

Hotel

Last week the Senior class gathered at
the Maxwell-Chambers Hotel for the first
of a series of smokers held for, by, and of
the Senior class. At present it is planned
to have several smokers and social events
for the Senior class.

At first when the seniors began to ar-
rive each member was filled with food,
and according to the seniors this was the
most enjoyable part of the smoker. Fol-
lowing the feed, smokes of various kinds
were provided. Dick Flinn had prepared
a program which was then presented.

The program opened with the rendition
of several songs. Paul Fry presided at
the piano, while the songs were given by
the members of the Senior class present,
A Senior quartet, composed of Sid Aber-
nethy, Bill Archie, Knox Poole, and Chat
Clarke, gave several numbers,

The feature of the evening, however,
was a political discussion revolving about
the respective merits of the two leading
nominees. Hub Knox was the floor leader
for the Democrats and Smith, while Law-
rence Dumas was the Hooverite leader.
Several drastic changes in the personnel
of the class officers were suggested, also
in the number of titles of the various of-

“Y” BULLETIN BOARD
OF SERVICE TO ALL

On any campus there is a great need
for a general bulletin-board to which all
the student's have access. Tis the purpose
of the boards at the Y. M. C. A. to fill
this need on the Davidson campus. The
“Y" is an ideal place for it because of its
convenient location, and because so many
of the students use it every day.

No Official Announcement Made
as to Type of Organ Which
Will be Installed

Although it .has not beew officially
announced it is almost certain that the
auditorium of New Chambers will be

equipped with a pipe organ ‘of about

$20,000 value. The type of organ has
not as yet been selected although it is
thought that it will be of special con-
struction,

Dr. Ninniss, pipe organ director at
Queens College, Charlotte, N. C., who
helped install the organ at the new
Methodist church in Charlotte, will di-
rect the installation of the organ in

It is probable that an instructor in

new organ being used for practice.
