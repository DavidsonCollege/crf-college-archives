Nation of Islam: Are th

ese ideals we should promote?

Wren I heard that a member of
the Nation of Islam was coming to
Davidson College, I was quite dis-
turbed. After all, the Nation of
Islam, a black separatist movement
led by Louis Farrakhan, teaches
that the white man is the enemy
and incapable of love.

Their then-spokesman Khalid
Abdul Muhammed said, accord-
ing to Fred Bruning’s Macleans
article, “Nothing Produces Hate
Like Hatred,” that after blacks take
control of South Africa, they should
kill whites who do not leave in one
day.

"We kill the women, we kill
the babies, we kill the blind. We
kill the cripples. We kill the fag-
got. Wekill the lesbian. When you
get through killing them all go to
the Goddamned graveyard and dig
up the grave and kill them a-God-
damn-gain because they didn’t die

hard enough.”

Anti-white, anti-homosexual,
and anti-Semitic. Louis Farrakhan
has suggested that the Holocaust
never happened, has called Hitler a
“great man,” and has generally
blamed Jews for the problems of
the black race.

An employee of Davidson
College who was there told me that
it was for “minority students only.”
I was told that because my skin
was the wrong color, I could not
enter. I’m sorry, but this is wrong.
Exclud’ng me on the basis of my

Islam is not the place to look. But

boy who doesn’t understand, right?

Well, I understand this: on
Friday night a group of hate was
welcomed to our campus. A group
of racism and intolerance. If any

So, when I heard
that the Nation of
Islam was com-

BSC, I was, need-
less to. say,

I decided to go to see this

exactly what his message was. But
I was not allowed to hear his mes-

Not seeing a large crowd, I asked if
they were still having a speaker.

And so Lask those of you who
invited the Nation of Islam here to
Davidson College, what are your
goals? What do you hope to ac-

you were manipulated.

Any sense of self-worth or
self-esteem which is the result of
putting down others is worthless.
Skinheads may feel really good
about themselves because they are
not black or not Jewish. But this is
a false sense of worth.

Blacks should have a sense of
worth for the same. reason as ev-

eryone else should — because they
are people, humans. Genuine self
worth cannot flow from hate and
contempt for others.

Late Friday night I began to
wonder what would have happened
if it was a white supremacist group
who visited Davidson. Can you
imagine the uproar if a group of
whites invited the KKK and then
excluded non-whites from the
meeting? There would likely be
calls for action against whatever
group would do such a thing.

Personally I feel that if the
BSC is going to be a place where
exclusion and hate are accepted,
then it has no place on our campus.
It is doubtful that the majority of
BSC members advocate hate and
exclusion, but the events of this
past Friday night might suggest
otherwise.

Dahmer’s murder and the slowly cooking frog

The murder of Jeffrey Dahmer in
a Wisconsin prison last week not
only represents yet another unfor-
givable breach of duty by the State,
but also a breakdown of our demo-
cratic system. The glee and laugh-
ter l’ ve heard from members of the
Davidson community on this mat-
ter is unfortunate.

The citizens of Wisconsin,
through theirelected and appointed
officials, have decreed that there
shall be no death sentence in their
fine state. However, the regret-
table decision to place Mr. Dahmer
ina normal prison was tantamount
to the death penalty, which the
citizens of Wisconsin defeated at
the ballot box. There were reports
of inmates in Mr. Dahmer’s
cellblock contacting the families
-of his victims with cryptic mes-
sages of how they would “take
care of him.” Nobody can tell me
that his murder was not predict-
able, and one cannot help but shiver

when the prosecuting attorney in
the case was quoted after Dahmer’s
death, saying with sardonic mean-
spiritedness, “Now, the Dahmer
family will have toexperience what
his victim’ s families experienced..”
Where is the respect for Wisconsin
law one deserves to expect from a
paid state official? The decision to
expose Jeffrey Dahmer to such a
situation as would cause his death
represents a deplorable lack of re-
spect for Wisconsin voters and their
commitment to the maintenance of
human life.

If the state of Wisconsin has
no death penalty sentence on the
books, it is the sacrosanct duty of
the State, no matter how awful his
crime might have been, to assure
that he lives. This apparent break-
down (whether conspiratorial or
not) is grounds for an enormous
civil lawsuit on behalf of the
Dahmer family. The inmates who
murdered him, the state officials

Rosie
Molinary

who sanctioned his return to a nor-
mal prison, and the guards on duty
at the time of the slaying should be
aggressively prosecuted to the full-
est extent of the law; the first for
murder, the others for negligence.

Economist Walter Williams,
in his speech at Davidson last year,
likened the present encroachment
by the government on our rights
(and even the rights of prisoners)
to cooking a frog. The water is
reaching its boiling point so gradu-
ally that we don’t notice in time to
jump out of the pot. Soon, if we do
nothing, our government will con-
tinue to advance, and our status as
a free society will be further en-
dangered. In this case, govern-
ment abdicated its legal responsi-
bility to protect the life of a human
being. What’s next?

Jeffrey Dahmer deserved the
death penalty. But for those of us
who value democracy, he must not
have died in vain.

To be a dreamcatcher

Ww ¢ talked last year about
dreams. He and I, sitting in some
foreign room, talking about things
that very well may have been im-
possible, but we were dedicated to
the idea, nonetheless.

Ilearned something that after-
noon. He was sixteen, from the
projects, and had already lost a
child. He was a pathetic welfare
fatality and he had dreams.

“I'd like to open a home for
needy children one day. If Icould
just let kids have a place that made
sense for awhile. Make them feel
loved and safe.”

I have kept that conversation
with me for months. Every now
and again when I want to yell and
scream about life, I think of him
saying, “I want to help children,”
instead of, “Why hasn’t anyone
ever helped me?”

And I bite my tongue knowing that

I really don’t have it bad.

His dreams, however, have
ceased, I visited him the other day
by sheer chance. As he talked, I
asked what was going on, what he
was looking forward to, how his
life was going.

His eyes held some distinct
rage [had never witnessed. And in
a voice that was choked with so
much emotion that it pained me to
even listen, he said, “I want to get
out of the projects without being in
a body bag.”

I reminded him of what his
dreams had been, what happened
to the children’s home. He stared
out at nothing, away from me.

“T don’t know about all that.
I’m pretty skeptical about a person
making a difference. A person
can’t do anything anymore; can’t
make a difference. I’m lost. This
whole generation is lost. All you

hear is talk. Talk is cheap. There’s
nothing changing out there. Idon’t
know about dreams.”

I didn’t show much emotion

then. I left the school, got in the.

car, and drove back to Davidson
shaking. All day, I could only
hear, “I want to get out of the
projects without being in a body
bag.” I called Habitat for Human-
ity that day to see if I could get his
family out of the projects.
The process, however, will be slow.

I don’t know how to bring his
dreams back but I know that he
deserves them as much as Ido. For
once, he deserves to laugh. He
deserves to feel like he is seven-
teen and not forty-five. He de-
serves to feel wanted arid appreci-
ated.

Helping him will make a dif-
ference, hopefully. He is right,
however, it is not just him that is

lost. There are countless kids in
schools in Charlotte who are lost.
They need more than just someone
to tutor them, they need more than
just someone to drive them around.
They need someone to step in and
pull all of their resources and con-
tacts together to make some small
difference, to make life alittle more
fair. These kids didn’t choose to

live the way they do. And they do
not think they can ever live life
another way.

There is something vital about
dreams. An incredible motiva-
tional rush that dreams give you.
When you lose your dreams; you
lose part of your soul. Does any-
body want to be a dreamcatcher?

Case continued rom page 7

These boys repaid people out of
their own sense of. honesty, and
they had no idea that they were in
any sort of trouble.

The case has been appealed,
and the Review Board has sent it to
the Honor Council. The sanctions
are pending the completion of the
judicial process.

Davidson is a wonderful and
special place, and the Honor Code

is alarge part of that, but asituation
like this shakes one’s confidence
in our ability to expedite fairness
and makes one question the defini-
tion of “Honor” that the school
subscribes to. I believe this deci-
sion should be reversed, their
records cleared, the punishment be
lessened and we should all use it to
take a good look at the place and
meaning of truth and honor in our
lives.

Sincerely,

Nina Blount '97
