and to go through an orienta-
tion session.

Media Board member Buck
Lawrimore said, ‘‘these miea-
sures are intended to increase
responsibility and awareness
among candidates for student
media offices.’’ pa ga

The proposed “statement of
intent,’’ according to Lawri-
more, is ‘“‘a signed statement
setting forth standards of res-
ponsibility adopted by the
Media Board.”

“The statement of intent is
not a statement of prior re-
straint in any shape or form,”
Greyard said.

The proposed orientation ses-
sion is a measure designed ‘‘to
familiarize student editor with
the dangers of libel, the impor-
tance of good taste, and the
necessity to uphold the high

The orientation tentatively
includes discussions with pro-
fessional journalists in Char-
lotte, with lawyers familiar with
_ libel suits, and ‘with Media
Board members.

Greyard is planning to pre-
sent the proposal to the Trus-
tees May 10 for their endorse-
ment.

Lawrimore said, ‘‘The propo-
sal will increase the helping role
of the Media Board and it will
increase interaction between the
Board and student media or-
ganizations. Thé),Media Board
will serve more as a counselor
and less as a policeman.”

He caught an 8:30 a.m. flight
to Boston from Charlotte, Terry
said.

Sophomore Merle Miller, who
attended the dinner, thought
“The fact she (Okomba) was
serving added to the earlier
insult that she was not included
in the greeting activities.”

Miller said, ‘‘It’s hard for us

(Americans) to understand the
gravity of the situation -- we
cannot really understand the

respect other cultures place in

their customs.”

Secretary of the All African
Conference of Churches. A na-
tive of Liberia, he received his
Masters of Theology at Har-

Was the nuclear accident a blessing?

(CPS) -- Some public utilities
and industry suppliers are ac-
tually viewing the recent acci-
dent at Harrisburg’s Three Mile
Island nuclear power plant as a
“blessing in disguise,’’ accor-
ding to a report in Advertising
Age. ‘If we come out of this
thing without an injury, it
would be a boost for the
industry,’’ said David Jones,
head of advertising for General
Electric’s Power.Systems divi-
sion.

A spokesman for the Edison
Electric Institute, which has
advertised on behalf of the
power-generating industry in
the past, doesn’t think the
incident has ruffled that many
feathers. ‘‘Our sense is that
support for the nuclear industry
hasn’t changed very much since
Three Mile Island,” said Jack
Young of the Institute.

Young feels that people out-
side the affected area aren’t that
concerned. ‘‘The media bom-
bardment in the East was
somewhat stronger than in the

rest of the country. That causes
people to think that the reaction
in the Midwest is as strong as it
is here in New York. It isn’t,”
he told a trade journal.

Meanwhile the utility which
oversaw the Pennsylvania
plant, General Public Utilities
Service Corp. of New Jersey, is
not only keeping quiet, but is
axeing most of its $500,000
advertising budget.

‘What happened will cut into
our earnings. Cost will have to
be trimmed somewhere,”’ a
spokesman said.

Most of the companies asso-
ciated with nuclear power, how-
ever, are planning some sort of
response to Three Mile Island,
either through advertising or a
public relations effort. Said
Richard Thorsen, advertising
director for Chicago’s Common-
wealth Edison, the largest nu-
clear power generator among
public utilities, ‘‘We hope to be
saying something, but we don’t
know the particulars yet.”
