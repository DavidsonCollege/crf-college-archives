First Half

Flake Laird started the scoring when he
tossed in a snowbird after a long scrimmage.
Dick, for Concord, came back and tied the
score in the next minute. Laird tossed in
another and after both clubs had failed on
free throws, Staley rang up a counter, mak-
ing the For minutes the
score remained stationary, due to poor pass-
ing by both teams, and then Faggart shoo a
field goal.

This stirred the Wildeats to action, and
with Staley, Laird, Hewlett and Davis tig-
uring in the scoring, they ran up 11 points.

levery angle and was largely responsible for
lthe Charlotte team’s victory.

For the Wildcats, Flake Laird collected 8
points and played a consistent game. He was
the only Davidson man to score from the
free throw line.

Davidson's inability to convert their op
ponents’ fouls into points was, noticeable.
Only 2 out of 10 fonl throws were made
good and Laird garnered these. The “Y"
team made 4 out of 10 shots good.

Leeper’s work at center was noticeable.
Several times he made shots count.
John Schenck, old Davidson player, held
down guard position on the Charlotte
team. Aleck MeMillan, another Davidson
boy, substituted for him near the end of the

long

game.

Sapp and Boges, at guard, played good
for the Wildeats. Staley was  off-
form and could not find the basket.

Saved is a piaster Made, and that more En-
joyment can be secured by preening the
Feathers on a silver eagle than any chicken
that dots the Knecking Parties.

We walked his’ hands to) save his
shoes and turned his necktie Inside out On

on

His only foolish expenditure was
the Purchase of Dri Hokum's Toothsome
Tooth pase, for which he had a passion, or

jas the vulgar would say, he liked it. His

paternal father trained him up like a bean
vine to Observe thrift and not to talk much

for fear of stretching his collar. He he-

icame so stingy that he could squeeze a nickle

so hard, six pennies would drop from His
Fist. The Rattle of Filthy Lucre pleased
him more than the Knocking of a High
Powered Flivver or the klink of koke bot-

tles,

As his pathway was a Shining example of
Success to all who strived to have their
fingers in the Dough, he was the idol of
Mother’s Eyes when he Appeared on the
streets of ye Native village.

The call of the Big -City came over him
so he Sallied Forth. He even bought a
change of tooth paste with his trusty Black-
brush. The bright lights of the
metropolis dazzled his Optics for a while,
but not so much that his rustic vision could
not observe all the calves and chickens. He
had not slipped behind the barn and perused
the Pink pages of the Police Gazetter for
naught.

He met with a pretty stenographer who
really used a Typewriter. She vamped and
r¢-vamped him. He fell for her like an
Ethiopean does for the well-known Marsu-
pial. He even got so bold as to get himself

_some chewing gum on Sunday nights to dis-

pel the Onions of the Day. However, the
Vamping Person lured him away from his
Cherished Piasters. She wheedled him into
saying yes every time she opened her fly-
trap. The poor Rustic felt his Jack slipping
like a Sprig of Okra down a fat Man's
Esophagus.

No more than a Month had passed until
his bank account was laying low. The Fair
One Simply devoured his Money and he
couldn’t catch on. He just wondered. Be-
fore long he was broke, Dead Broke.

The Old Man sent him a registered letter
saying for hi mto come home as ‘he had
struck oil. He had busted his Cranium over
a Kerosene Can when he stumbled over a
Feline, Slumbering on the Floor. So the
poor Lad traveled home, disgusted with
Women in general. After he had thought
for several days, he came to the conclusion
that all they want is your Money.
