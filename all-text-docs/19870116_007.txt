Wrestlers drop four tough matches in rough week

By SUSAN WILKINS

Davidson’s_ wrestling team
has had a busy week, wrestling at
home last Saturday in a quad meet
against Elon, Georgia Tech and
The Citadel, and wrestling away
on Wednesday against Furman.
Unfortunately, the Cats dropped
all four matches.

In Saturday’s first match,
Davidson was up against Southern
Conference rival Citadel. The
Citadel has several scholarship
wrestlers and one All-American,
so the Wildcats expected a tough
match.

At 118, freshman Holme Ol-
trogge dropped his match 3-0,
despite wrestling well in both the
second and third periods. Ol-
trogge’s man scored a takedown
to begin the match and could do
nothing else thereafter. He upped
the score by winning the
time point.

Senior Michael Adams, the
126-pounder for the Cats, lost by
decision to one of Citadel’s schol-
arship athletes. Adams was taken
down and turned to his back re-
peatedly as Citadel’s man domi-
nated the match.

Wrestling at 134 for Davidson
was freshman Bruce Newsome.
Newsome went down 9-0 before
managing to give the Cats some
hope by scoring on a reversal.
Hope died fast, however, as

riding ~

Newsome was reversed and pin-
_ ned a few seconds later.

Sophomore Matt Merrill lost
his match by decision in the 142-
pound weight class. Merrill re-
versed his man and scored an es-
cape before going down.

At 150, senior captain John T.
Lay won the first match for David-
son against Citadel’s usual 158-
pounder. Lay was awarded two
points when his opponent was
caught stalling, and then Lay took
him down to finish the match. Lay
won the riding time point and
thus, won the match 5-0.

Sophomore Sherb Sentell had
the misfortune to wrestle Citadel’s
All-American at 158. The All-
American lived up to his ranking,
pinning Sentell with 2:24 left to go
in the first period. The Citadel led
Davidson 27-3. ~

Davidson had to forfeit the
167-pound weight class. Junior

—Doug Batchelor was hurt the pre-

vious Thursday and is expected to
be out for the season due to shoul-
der injuries.

Junior captain Tim Heinze
beat his man by taking him down,
letting him escape and taking him
down again. Heinze worked for
the pin, but could not stick the
Citadel man: He won 15-3.

Despite getting off to a slow
start, junior 190-pounder Doug
Saintsing wrestled well. Saintsing

was down 9-0 before he made his
move. He came back to within
two points with a minute remain-
ing. The Citadel wrestler then got
lucky and scored two escapes and
the match ended. The Bulldog
wrestler had riding time, and so
Saintsing lost 17-13.

Senior heavyweight Gary
Branch finished off the match for
the Wildcats by pinning his man.
Branch was up by 12 before he
stuck his man, scoring most of his
points off his opponent’s back.

* The final team score for the
match was Citadel 36, Davidson
14.

The Wildcats then wrestled
Georgia Tech. —

In the 118 class, Oltrogge was
down by seven before the Yellow
Jacket stung him in the third
period. Georgia Tech led by six.

At 126, Adams lost another by
decision. His opponent took him
down and then turned him to his
back to score.

Davidson's first points came”

at the 134-pound weight class.
Newsome stepped onto the mat to
receive the Tech forfeit.

At 142, Merrell reversed his
man once to make the match score
5-2. He then was taken down and

~turned to his back. The score was

13-2 when Tech’s man pinned
him. Beat
Lay again provided David-

son’s first win of the afternoon,
beating his 150-pound weakling
9-6. ‘

At 158, Sentell looked better
than he did against The Citadel’s
All-American, but still was pin-
ned, this time in the second
period. Georgia Tech led David-
son 21-9.

At 177-pounds, Heinze wres-
tled the match of the day. Heinze
had the match won (the score was
6-6 but Heinze had riding time)
until the last two seconds, when
the Georgia Tech wrestler _re-
veresed to score the two points he
needed to win 8-7.

At 190, Saintsing was on the
defensive for all of the match; he
ended up losing 19-8.

At heavyweight, Branch met
his match and was pinned in the
first period. Davidson lost to Geo-
rgia Tech 39-9.

Davidson wrestled Elon in the
final match of the day.

Oltrogge lost a close match at
118, 5-2. In the final period, Ol-
trogge had control, but could not
turn the Elon wrestler to his back
to score the needed three points.

At 126, Adams excited the
crowd by scoring his first point of
the day, but ended by losing 17-1.
His opponent used the double
chicken wing on him successfully
and the match had to be stopped
twice as the move injured Adams.

Newsome, at 134, was pinned
for the second time. His opponent

- led 2-0 when he pinned him.
Merrell’s opponent followed .-

his teammate’s example and pin-
ned Merrell in the 142-pound
weight class. Merrell was down 6-
2 when he was pinned.

At 158, Lay was happy to ac-
cept a forfeit from Elon. At 167,
Elon was happy to accept a forfeit
from Davidson.

Elon forfeited again at 177,
and the team score was now
Davidson 12, Elon 27.

At 190, Saintsing won‘for the
Cats 9-5, scoring most of his
points on takedowns and’ rever-
sals. :

Branch came back at the
heavyweight position to pin his
man, marking up his team-leading
fourth pin of the year.

Davidson lost to Elon 27-21.

Wednesday night the Cats
travelled to Furman to wrestle
their second Southern Conference
match of the year. The score fluc-
tuated before the Paladins finally
won the match 33-21. Winners for
