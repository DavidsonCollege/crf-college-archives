Lili St. Cyr to appear
in D. C. Artist Series

The Davidson College Artist
Series Commitee has successfully
completed its quest of the spring
semester by clinching the coup of
its career, Lili St. Cyr. The com-
mittee has expressed tremendous
optimism concerning the attention
that Miss St. Cyr will receive at
Davidson and is anticipating a
large sale of tickets to the public

of the nearby cultural centers of |:

Cornelius and Mooresville.

Miss St. Cyr is scheduled to dis-
play her abilities in Chambers
Auditorium on April 8, beginning
ut 8:15 a.m. An overwhelming ma-
jority of the faculty has expressed
its consent to the suspension of
clusses for the day so that Miss
St. Cyr will be able to exhibit her
entire repetoire rather than try
to squeeze herself into anything
as short as the usual two-hour per-
formances of the Artist Series.

The Committee has some reser-
vations that a number of students,
porticularly underclassmen and
the unenlightened of the upper
classes, will not fully comprehend
nor appreciate Miss St. Cyr’s
artistry. Nevertheless they hope
the esthetic value derived from
performance by the sophisticates
will be such that the expense in-
volved in securing this engagement
will be justified.

Professors Peak, Purcell and Lil.
ly form a small but staunch
minority declaiming the appear-
ance of a “vulgar show” which
should not be allowed to “dese-
erate these halls made sacred by
the memory of Woodrow Wilson.”
Most of the remaining professors
concur with this analysis of the
act,

and liberal education of the stu-
dents.

Miss St. Cyr has revealed her
talents before unrestrained audi-
ences at such educational institu-
tions as Julliard School of Music,
Union Theological Seminary and
Ciro’s. Her most recent and highly
publicized appearance before a ses-
sion of the Beverly Hills Justice
Court wos hailed as “a symbol of
initiative and ambition which has
become synonymous with Ameri-
can free enterprise.”

The feature exhibition of Miss
Cyr’s production is entitled “Inter-
lude Before Evening” and adhibits
ebullient thermae. Coffee will be
served in the Union Ballroom fol-

but decry any attempt to lowing the performance. Men are

FATHER DIVINE

Bargeron, Cooper,
and Hayes flunk out

The administration announced
today that the following students,
Robert Hayes, Eugene Bargeron,
and Cortez Cooper, have been dis-
missed from college for failure to
meet academic requirements.

Upon being pressed by David-
sonian reporters an official who
preferred to remain anonymous
elaborated further on the dis-
missals. In regard to Bargeron, the
official said, “When the Davidson
standards fall so low that we can
allow students with grades so dis-
gracefully and pitifully low to re-
main in attendance here, then we
will frankly admit that PC ranks
highest in liberal arts.”

A search of files containing high
school transcripts revealed ‘that
Bob Hayes did not have .a high
school average which is acceptable
for entrance into Davidson College.
This had been overlooked at the
time of Hayes’ application. Con-
siderate officials immediately no-
tified Hayes that he was no longer
a member of the greater Davidson
family.

The Cooper dismissal resulted
from the rapid rise of this student
in the ranks of a widely known
communist front organization
(number 69 on the Justice Depart-
ment’s list of subversive organiza-
tions), the Reserve Officers Train-
ing Corps. As soon as this affilia-
tion became known to college of-
ficials, who desired to protect Da-
vidson from McCarthy criticism,
Cooper was dismissed under the
pretense of unsatisfactory scholar-
ship.

Library adds two
popular magazines

Among the recent additions to
the College Library are the popu-
lur magazines Sunshine and Health
and Pleyboy. Dr. Chalmers David-
son, director of the library, termed
the acquisitions “a great step for-
ward in our cultural advance.”

Continuing he added, “You know,
of course, that the editor of Sun-
shine and Health was a Davidson
graduate. We have tried for years
to get Mr. Boone to send us a free
subscription, but he is so chinchy
that he wouldn't even consider it.
After careful study, we decided to
cancel our subscription to The
Presbyterian Outtook and apply the
money to the new subscription.”

Pleyboy was added as 2 result
of numerous faculty and adminis-
tration requests. Dr. Davidson ex-
pressed the opinion that the con-
tent of the magazine might be
“above the heads of most Davidson
students. ,

Dr. James S. Purcell of the Eng-
lish Department called attention to
the subtle humor and famous
classics printed monthly, and fine
arts professor Douglas Houchens
praised the superb art work. Him-
self a child-care expert, he was
very pleased that a Playmate sec-
tion had been added especially for
the kiddies.

“To tell the truth,” said Dr.
Davidson, “I had expected op-
position from the trustees.
we made the announcement of our
subscriptions at 3 ‘o’clock and at
3:03 not a single trustee had regis-
tered a protest. I think that’s a
very encouraging sign.”

But

Talmadge, Divine,
Middleton slated

Dr. John R. Cunningham, Presi-
dent of Davidson College, today
announced the complete program
for Davidson's 115th Commence-
ment Exercises. The long weekend
of events will begin Friday, June
10, and conclude with the gradua-
tion exercises on June 13.

The commencement season. will
be officially, opened on Friday
night with a concert by the interna-
tionally known coloratura soprano
Velma Middleton. Miss Middleton
is currently enjoying an unsur-
passed season with the Metropoli-
tan Opera Company in New York
where she is literally overwhelm-
ing her gaping admirers by her
very physical size.

She has recently: returned from
a very, successful European tour.
The only mishap on this trip was
the sinking of the Ile de France as
Miss Middleton boarded in La
Harve harbor.

In her concert here the artist
will sing the “Cafe' Song” from
“Carmen Jones,” the “Sextette’|
from “Lucia de Lammourmour,”
and “I ain't go nobody” from the
smash Broadway musical of the
same name. Her accompanist for
the concert will be the noted
French pianist Louis de Strong-
arm.

The baccalaureate sermon will
be delivered Sunday morning,
June 12, by the _ interna-
tionally known religious figure
Father Divine. This deeply sun-
burned self-styled diety is a resi-
dent of Philadelphia. He has or-
ganized several very promising
“heavens” in Atlantic City, Pitts-
burg, and other Eastern cities.
However, he is most well known
as a inter-racial marital expert,
Divine will also be awarded an
honorary DD degree from the col-
lege in closing ceremonies.

High spot of the entire week-
end will be the graduation address.
It will be delivered this year by
the well known arch-liberal gov-
ernor of Georgia, Herman Tal-
madge. Governor Talmadge, who
has just returned from weeping on
the grave of Walter White, indi-
cated to Dr. Cunningham today
that he would be able to be here
for the services. It is understood
from usually reliable sources high
in the administration that Tal-
madge will stress in hid talk one
of his favorite projects, the ad-
mission of Negroes to Davidson.

Governor Talmadge has been ac-
credited with the famous state-
ment, “There are only two things
I hate, niggers and prejudice.”

It is understood that 69 seniors
will be awarded degrees in the
final exercise, I BS!, 2 BA2s, 1 BA1

(you fool!!!), and 65 BS2s.
Among those who will receive
honorary LLD degrees in the exer-
cises are Hugh F. (Hugo) Sapp, Da-
vidson sundriest, and former mayor
of Davidson, who overwhelmingly
defeated former mayor Ernest
Beaty in the 1949 election (see
Davidsonien, Friday, April 1, 1949);
and Clyde Moore, well-known com-
poser of Davidson and Mooresville;
and Mary Potts, for her devoted

service to Davidson students and |’

faculty.

In addition to Father Divine, an
honorary DD degree will be
awarded to Daddy Grace of the
Charlotte House of Prayer.

As the climax of the activities,
a large plaque (value $20,000) will
be dedicated. This plaque, located
in the natrix of the college church,
commemorates those who con-
tributed up to 50 cents for the
1954 Gift Fund Drive.

Floyd Feeney and Leighton Green, the two principals in the recent government shakeup, are
seen respectively st the depth of degradation and the height of victorious confidence. Feeney,
trapped by Green’s Geurillas as he tries to detonate the local armory, futilly commands his former
troops to lay down their arms. Green stands in front of his capitol after proudly affirming that “lf—
Feeney tries to make « comeback, I'll wash him clear to Cornelius.”—(Staff photos by Daniel.)

ROTC dept. is abolished

Washington—As a result of its
showing in the Federal inspection
of March 15, the Davidson College
ROTC has been abolished. The
move, officially proclaimed by the
Defense Department, will, it is
feared by college authorities, con-
demn that’ small monastic institu-
tion to oblivion as an educational
center.

Reason for the removal, as cor-
roborated by the Pentagon’s higher
echelon, is rumored to the failure
of the regiment to meet the speci-
fications of efficiency prescribed
by the Department of the Army.
This deficiency was detected
during the annual Federal inspec-
fon conducted 15 March 1955.

This latest revelation from Wash-
ington partially exposes the occa-
sion for the evacuation maneuvers
being ‘enacted by the campus
ROTC corps. Rumors have been
rife among the student body since
the dismal inspection of said con-

tingent on March 15 bared its in-
efficiency and disorganization.
The authorities that be were
deeply impressed by the unusual
intelligence displayed by the ca-
dets during classroom inspection.
‘They were particularly affected by
replies received in answer to such
complex intellectual queries as
“Who is Commander-in-Chief of

the United States military forces?”

(David Schine, Mick Cannon, Nick:
olai Bulganin) and “What is the
prepuratory command given to
form a platoan?” (Gung Hot;
Stand Up!’ Gravitate Inwardly!),

An especially sparkling drill
performance introduced _ novel
executions of orders undoubtedly
created for the occasion by the
adroit corps commander Colonel
Cooper. Noteworthy was the ex-
temporaneous rendition of the Na-
tional Anthem while peon Gragg
was expostulating on the merits of
Tolstoyian  pacificism. Also  im-
pressive were Colonel Sapp’s white

Following this exhibition there

that their concentrated endeavors

THE EDITORS.

Wednesday, March 30, the new
Charlotte-Mount Mourne Freeway
in ceremonies con-
ducted by Governor Luther B.
Hodges and John Heath of the
Davidson College Administration.
The freeway, which has been under
construction for over a yeur, is an
integral part in the Davidson
building campaign, “Cloud over
Davidson,” initiated by Dr. J. Rood
Cunningham in 1941.

Governor Hodges listed the free-
way as “the greatest achievement
in Carolina highways sinee Kerr
Scott built the Haw River-Washing-
ton turnpike upon his victory in
the Senate race last year.” In a
statement to the citizens of North
Carolina delivered during the cere-
monies atop the porch of historic
Eumanean Hall, Governor Hodges
was happy to announce that “with
the support of your tax money and
the Davidson College Christmas
Gift Fund we were able to put
through one of the vital links in
our economic system. Mount
Mourne, seat of nearly half the
state’s whammy revenue, is now
connected directly with the Queen

City of the Carolinas, and strate-
gically located between them
stands historic old Davidson Col-
lege, alma mater of LL Polk and
Woodrow Wilson, to mention only
a few.”

Said John Heath, who was Da-
vidson's official representative to
the opening, “Toot, toot.”

Dr. Cunningham, whose tireless
efforts to have an erection of the
road during the past years have
roused the admiration of all con-
cerned, spoke for the student body
of the college when he said that
“Now at last, after so many tedious
years of bumming on Highway 21,
the Davidson student will have
only to leave his dormitory to take
advantage. of the magnificent out-
door opportunity of ‘thumbing on
the freeway’.” “The only regret,”
said Cunningham, “is now that we
will have to dig up our little white
signs on the outdated highway
which say ‘Approaching Davidson
College, A Libel Arts College for
Men’ and call our magnificent yard
force to replant them on the new

highway ”

MORNING EDITION

dministration ousted in campus revolution

“ J
, val

Christian-Socialists
seize government!

DP - Christian Socialist leader
Leighton Green led a coup yester-
day which unseated army-backed
Floyd Fulton Feeney dictatorship
in Davidson. Latest authoritative
resources indicate that the Green
forces have all but mopped up the
last remaining Feeney holdouts.

Late last night, according to
Col. Alonzo Cooper, military at-
tache for the Feeney regime, only
one small stronghold of the Feeney
adherents held out stubbornly ‘in
Hattie’s. The dictator himself,
trapped finally in the upper story
of the library, was flushed down
by Green’s guerillas and trapped in
front of his’ army headquarters
while trying to blow up the arsenul.
He awaits trail.

M. Alfred Crouse, Davidsonian
war correspondent in the battle
zone, released the following com-
mentary on conditions at the front
during the late evening:

Leighton Green, head of the
Christian-Socialist party on the
campus,. appears to have been
completely successful in his revo-
lution against the Floyd Feeney
regime, which he termed “reaction-
ary to the nth plus one degree.”
Only a few Loyalists are reported
holding out in such remote spots
as the third floor of Rumple and
the back room of Hattie’s.

After 18 hours of bitter fighting.
Green’s troops hoisted their flag
over Georgia dormitory, headquar-
ters and armory of Feeney’s re-
gime. Blake Brinkerhoff, Green's
right-hand man, estimated that
some- 20 Christian-Socialists had
been killed in the struggle and
hundreds wounded, but he added ~
“No price is too high to pay for
our cause.”

Blond, well-tanned Green from
El Paso, Texas, set up his revolu-
tionary government’s offices in the
lobby of the College Union. Shaw
Smith, director of the Union, re-
portedly was hostile to the new
government but withdrew his oppo-
sition when offered an undisclosed
position in the cabinet.

Although tension had been
building up between the two fac-
tions for several weeks, the major
cause of the revolution was the
revelation by Pat Ward (testifying
in New York) that members of the
Feeney. regime had been among
her best customers. The Christian-
Socialists immediately began agi-
tation for a vote of confidence,
hoping to take over the student
government by legal means.

Armed fighting broke out yester-
day after demaogogue Feeney read
in chapel a notice banning Green
from Davidson on the grounds that
he was a “potential enemy to our
tradition.”

Apporently Green had been ex-
pecting the ban, because Feeney
had hardly finished speaking when
a machinegun opened fire from
the batcony. Peeney was wounted
in the left little toe and toppled
from the platform into the lap of
Herb Russell, organist.

Reactionary faculty members
tried to take over the machinegun
position, but the Green forces
quickly mowed them down with
automatic rifle and grenade fire.
“I didn’t take ROTC for four years
for nothing,” commented Green, “I
used the tactics of reaction to
destroy reaction.” '

Green was formerly an officer in
the Student Army, but he repu-
diated his commission several days
before the coup. His reason: “You
can’t expect progress from a back-
ward organization.”

Feeny could not be contacted by
the press, Rumor has it that he
retreated into the impenetrable
barricades of the library on the
theory that the Christian-Socialists
would not attack and destroy the
storehouse of knowledge. “He will
have to come out for food soon,”
said Dr. W. O. Puckett of the
biology department, “he can’t live
an cellulose.”

Fuehrer Green said that al-
though they were still alive.
Feeney and his cohorts were
thoroughly discredited. “Feeney
has shown us nothing except pro-
crastination and a do-nothing pol-
icy since he fooled the gullible in
last year’s election. I'm glad J had
the guts to throw him out of of-
tice.”
