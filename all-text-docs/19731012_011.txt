IMAC Sifts ‘The Good From The’ Bad’

By CAPTAIN AMERICA
And

NO BUCKY
The IMAC flickerball league,
acting like a flour sifter, has
just about finished the
good from the bad from the

y.

The ugly in this case being the
squads that have forfeited
themselves into oblivion. I am
talking to you Em #2.

In Wednesday’s action, the
Pikas behind the Fran Tarken-
ton - Gene Washington com-
bination of the IMAC defeated
the Tennis Bums’ eratic squad
34-18.

QB Jimmy Boyd hit Lester
Abberrger for most of the af-
ternoon, through the pourous
Bum’s defense.

The Bums may be old but
they more than make up for it
by not being in shape

PGD nipped R-I 9-3 i in the an-
nual Safety Bowl. (A safety is 3
points in flickerball).

No, folks, there were no field
goals between pine trees’ just
tough defense.

In one of the first biggies of
the year, the rambunctious
Cleveland Indians fell before
the onslaught of Peyton
Prospere’s SAE #1 squad, 33-
18.

Rumor has it that the Tribe
was just ‘‘one toke over the
line’’.

On Thursday a prophecy was
fulfilled.

as the “‘Turkeys of the year”

Durham, is also one of the
returning veterans from last
year’s squad. Frank has been
pleased with the work he has
done and mentioned that he
played a t the number five spot
two years ago and won the con-
ference title.

Frank feels that Scott Dimon
has had a very good fall prac-
tice and is playing well as a
steady performer. Jim Dorsett,
who saw some doubles action
last season, is also back for the
Cats.

Two freshmen have also
made the team for the coming
year. They are Edward Patton
and Steve Holman. Frank ex-
pects both of them to see some
action and gain some ex-
perience which will be
especially helpful next year.

“They have a lot of poten-
tial,’’ he commented. ‘‘But they
lack experience.”

Frank also thinks that the
doubles competition does not
look nearly as strong this
season as in past years.

“(We may not be able to win
the doubles as much as we
would like,’’ Frank explained.
“As of now there is really no
way to tell who will even be
playing these positions.”

The Cats appear to have lost
their top-heavy look from last
season, when they had tremen-
dous strength in the top portion
of the order.

Frank instead sees that they
will be deep in the three through
six spots with quite a few
players who could play in this

along with their sister hall C-IV,
held true to form by getting
mulched by powerful EM #1 60-0
in the biggest fiasco of the
young season.

Oh yes, C-IV also happens to
be 0-4. Ta-da.

I can’t seem to pick the win-
ners around here but the loser’s
sure are easy to find.

The SPE’s, on the rebound,
buoyed by their forfeit win over
SAE #2 decided to reek havoc
upon the mangy Altoona Aard-
varks (AA’s) as they rained
TD’s on Randy Wag’s boy 46-0.

Oh the ATO’s have graced the
column once more. And once
more it is because they got
kicked.

The Main Gozinyas are the
perpetrators of this chemical
assault as they mugged the wor-
se than useless O's 55-0.

ATO’s spokesman Bob Milks
had this to say: “They must
have had a hundred cans of beer
out there!’’ Keep pounding that
Bud, Gozinyas.

In other Thursday action

skidding Delts 19-14. Although
Pete Celantano’s prediction of a
shut out did not hold true, the
MG's did play a fine game.

Monday’s action was rained
out due to a premature ap-
pearance of the Davidson mon-
soons.

The rain either thought it was
winter or came in late for the
weekly weekend rainstorm.

Anyhow, Tuesday the power-
ful KA’s took a forfeit win over
R-I.

In other Tuesday action, SAE
No. 1 finished on top of League
IV at 4-0 as they crushed the
Wimpettes Plus, 54-12. How the
WP’s managed to score is a
mystery toponder. -

The appearance of the ‘‘Clin-
ton” Flash was 4lso noted, as
the Tennis Bums picked up a
strange looking tall fellow and
Howard Arbuckle.

The Bums then proceeded to
shred C-IV, 63-19. Of course the
Bums thought they were getting
close to Thanksgiving a little
early as they plucked the C-IV
turkeys.
