GYMNASIUM ‘TEAM GIVES
EXCELLENT EXHIBITION

Saturday afternoon an éxhibition was
given in Shearer Hall by the Gym
‘Team. ‘The entertainment began at 4
o'clock, when the ten athletes walked
out on the stage and formed a large
semi-circle pyramid. Just as they retired
a crash and clatter was heard at the
rear of the building, and three clowns,
so painted and disguised that they were
unrecognizable, ran down the aisle and
climbed upon the stage. During the
whole program they, by their humorous
action and words, drew many peals of
laughter from the audience.

Then the team began the exhibition.
First the several athletes vaulted, dived
and turned hand-springs over the
“horse” in rapid succession and bewild-
ering variety. Following this came the
“elephant.” On this the “stunts” were
of the same kind as on the horse except
they were greater and) more difficult.
Then there were several graceful, indi-
vidual “stunts” on the parallel bars.
The team next skillfully and rapidly
formed graceful human pvramids. In
the tumbling and diving that followed
the team showed the results of the hard
training they had undergone. The
work on the horizontal bar was vers
good. “Then with a squash pyramid
by the team and a last bow and grimace
by the clowns the exhibition ended.

‘The members of the team were: Ben:
nett, Gilchrist. Hawkins. J. R. Tones
Porter P. B. Price. McKeithan, ‘Thack-

er, Winn wand Young. ‘The clowns
were: A. M. Fairley, King, and R.
Minter.

The features of the exhibition were
the work by Thacker and the acting by
Minter. Phil Price astonished the audi-
ence by some fancy Chinese rope jump
inser,

The entertainment was attended bv
a large, appreciative crowd. All could
sce that the men were greatly hampered
bv lack of space and poor apparatus, but
felt that despite these handicaps, the
team had given a good exhibit.

MENTAL AND PHYSICAT.
COLLEGE S’FANDARDS

The following article appeared in a
recent: newspaper, and is) well) worth
consideration:

That Virginia colleges have organized
a union of their own, one object of
which is that no youth ignorant of the
rudiments of learning shall contend with
studies beyond the range of his compre-
hension, is as it should be. If college
education is to stand for anything, it
must mean that certain definite tasks
have been accomplished, and this ideal
will be advanced by fixing a uniform
standard for college entrance.

A hope may be ventured that the as-
sociation, while it is adopting rules and
regulations, may go a step further and
take over an idea which Dr. Henry L.
Smith, its president, has introduced at
Washington and Lee. He has laid down
the law that no student shall receive a
degree from his college who is physically
unfit and cannot swim. However puny
the products of other institutions may be.
the Lexington graduate must be a puis-
sant knight, prepared for the battle of
life.

Washington and L.ce’s rule is one of
the best conditions ever required in’ an
educational establishment. Our schools
have been cursed in the past by indif-
ference to the physical welfare of stu-
dents. Gymnasiums have been main-
tained, but as a ‘purely optional form of
amusement. Both in this country and
obroad the toll of study has been a heavy
one. Birmarck once said that one-third
of the German university men ruined
themselves by dissipation, one-third bv
over-study, and the remaining — third
ruled the empire.

That so large a percentage of stu-
dents were incapacitated bv study was
the fault of the svstem. Tf more im-
portance is attached to the general well-
being of the student than to the passing
of an examination, and if no degrees are
given unless the candidates can swim
box or otherwise acauit themselves mus:
cularly, there will be fewer college
graduate failures than at present.

LYCEUM ATTRACTION
NEXT SATURDAY NIGHT

A Lyceum attraction, “The Treble
Clef Club,” will be presented in Shear-
er Hall next Saturday night. It is com-
posed of four young ladies of more than
local renown. ‘The program consists of
vocal quartets, vocal solos and duets,
and humorous costume selections espe-
cially written for their performance.

It is desired that the students and all
others who can possibly do so, should
patronize this concert, because the
chance of securing an additional attrac-
tion this Spring depends upon the de-
gree of success with which this one
meets.

The manager of the Orchestra and
Glee Club reports that its concert was
attended by one of the largest audiences
that it has had in several years at Dav-
idson.

University of N. C.—The University
of N. C. Dramatic Club, starting on
March 28, will take an extended trip
through the State. The play which will
he given by them is “Arms and the
Man.”
