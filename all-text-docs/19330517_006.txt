Pearce Comes to Close of Flaming
Athletic Career

By GEORGE GULLETTE

Paul Brown « .

Paul Brown, of Atlanta, Ga., is an excel-
lent example of “sana mens in sano corpore.”
Not only has he been president of the Da-
vidson Y. M. C. A., but he has also been
in front in other fields.

He was born in Atlanta on July 2, 1911,
and has resided there ever since. He had
both his grammar school and high school
training in Atlanta.

In high school, he received many high
honors, several of which have been paralleled
in college. He was president of the High
“Y” in the Boys’ School. While there he
was consistently on the honor roll. In his
senior year, he and Edward McNair were
two of the nine boys awarded gold “B’s”
for excellence in scholarship.

He was business manager of both his
school annual and school paper, but he did
not continue his publications work at David-
son. In high school he earned his letter
in track, in the high jump, and has also
been a regular on the Davidson track team.
In high school he was a lieutenant-colonel
in R. O. T. C, and in the Davidson R. O.
T. C. he has advanced to the rank of cap-
tain. :

The fact that he won the cup awarded
annually by the Atlanta Journal ta.the best
all-around senior would sum up all his hon-
ors received in high school. He has spent
most of his summers in travelling. Two
summers he was ia Connecticut, and one
summer he got his taste of Canada.

During his freshman year he was on the
baseball squad and gained his numeral in
track. He won the alumni medal offered
annually to the freshman having the high-
est scholastic average. :
. His physical ability was best shown when
in his junior year he won the gymnastic
trophy, offered each year by the college to
the one excelling in several specific lines of
gymnastic stunts.

At present Paul is leading the Senior class
in scholarship, and is, of course, a member
of the national scholarship honorary fra-
ternity, Phi Beta Kappa. He was president
of Delta Phi Alpha, honorary German fra-
ternity, and has membership in Gamma Sig-
ma Epsilon and Pi Delta Alpha.

For the past year Paul has been president
of the Davidson Y. M. C. A., a very impor-
tant factor in Davidson life.

Charlie Pearce

From the time when as a baby his father
taught him to be a southpaw, until the pres-
ent day, Charlie Pearce has been an athlete
of the first calibre. Judging both from his
past life and his excellent services as presi-
dent of the Athletic Association for the past
year, Davidson has never had a more suit-
able man for this position.

He was born in Plant City, Florida, in
February of 1912, and his home has been
there ever since. He received his first pub-
licity there, when at the age of 12 he was
the hero of a 7-6 victory against the Hope-
well' Football Midgets. In spite of the fact
that he is only of average size (ht, 5’ 8%”;
wt. 168 lbs.), for many years he has been
a stellar athlete.

In high school Charlie did not bother much
about studying and never took school se-
riously, but managed to~always get by. ~ He
seems to have taken his athletics seriously,
though, for in his junior year he was the
first man in the history of the school to
make four letters.

Charlie spent most of his summers in a
cottage overlooking the Gulf of Mexico. His
chief hobbies were swimming and Boy
Scout work, in which he achieved the high
rank of Eagle.

He had never heard of Davidson until our
football team licked Florida University sev-

eral years ago, 12-0. Having been in Flor-
ida all his life, he wanted to go a good dis-
tance away.to college, and finally decided
on Davidson..- Since his entrance he has
liked Davidson better each year.

As a 145-pound freshman, Charlie showed
up well in football, basketball and baseball.
In his. sophomore year, however, he broke
an ankle early in the football season. This
put him out of athletics for the school year,
until the last three baseball games, which
enabled him to make his first letter.

In his junior year he played in 39 of 40
quarters in football and last fall he was in
38 of 40. Besides being a flashy runner, he
has been rated by sports writers as one of
the best punters in the state. He also passes,
making him a triple-threat man. Not only
was he picked on the All-State team, but
was selected on the All-South Atlantic elev-
en by sports writers, and one of the five

fall. His memorable run against Wake For-
est last fall will be Davidson history.

Charlie has also been a stellar baseball
pitcher. He handed the Wake Forest state
champions a licking in our only Big, Five
victory last year, allowing the Deacons only
two hits. By the time this paper is pub-
lished, Charlie will have played his last col-
lege game in an endeavor to help win the
state championship for the Wildcats.

After leading an athletic life, most men go
ahead with it after leaving college, but al-
though Charlie has had coaching offers, he
does not expect to continue his athletic ca-
reer. This summer he will study typing and
commercial law in preparation for entering
the insurance business.

The
Wildcats came right back in their half, when
Morris opened with Davidson’s first hit off
Barnes. Morrison advanced the big first
baseman to second with a sacrifice and
Whitley sent him across the plate with a
screaming single over short.

Pearce closed his college baseball career
in glory,. bringing his total of victories for
the season to six, as against no defeats, for
a perfect record. He shut out the Deacons
last year.

It was little Bruce Peabody who furnished
the thrill. In the fifth inning with the sacks
loaded and two away, Bunting sent a line
drive to left center, but Peabody made a
diving catch, of it to retire the side.
