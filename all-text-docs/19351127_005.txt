Efficient Cleaning Department
Employs Six Men

“Hey Freshman! Carry this down to
th’ laundry! Thanks!” with a scowl upon
his dainty face, he picks the bundle up
wearily and trudges to the laundry door
where it is tossed carelessly inside.

This could possibly go on as a story
about the freshman, one Julius B. Goo-
fink, but no—it’s about the Davidson
College laundry, an efficient organization.

Approximately 180 bundles of clothes
are laundered each day, being run in
five “lots” with thirty-six bundles making
up each lot. A bundle is first taken by
two women in the checking department
where each unmarked piece is marked
and a careful list made of all articles.
Shirts, socks, underwear, etc., are sorted
into separate piles and then taken
the washing machines, one for tlatkork
another for shirts, a third for underwear,
and the last for dark things.

different types of ‘straight

Escolite; a: “sour bin;”’ and
starch. The first soap, green in color,
has an olive oil base and is used in all
fuselage work or anything with colors
and fast. ‘he second with a tallow base,
is mixed with alkali; and the third is
known as “break powder” for the loos-
ening of dirt on the clothes. The

fleuride and 15% sodium acid fleuride,
and this is used to neutralize the clothes
between an acid and an alkali.

This last one is used for sheets, etc. ‘To
put the finishing touches on all ironing
there are four hand irons used.

The flatwork being still damp aiter
running through the extractor, is taken
to a large drying machine or “tumbler.”
After all the laundry has been washed,
dryed, and ironed, the different lots are
sorted out into bundles again, according
to respective numbers, rechecked,
wrapped, and are ready to go out.

The Davidson College Laundry owned
and operated by the college employs
twenty-four people, and over 15,000 pieces

of laundry are handled each week. All

ready within the same week.

what similar to the laundering of clothes.
A suit is first taken where it is cleaned.
This equipment consists of two cleaning
machines, and a pressure filter. The suit
is run fifteen minutes on the first clean-
ing fluid and at the end of this time it is
run fifteen more minutes on a second
cleaning fluid or a fresh solvent. This
fluid is kept clean all the time by being
constantly forced through the pressure
filter, which takes out all foreign mat-
ter that the ‘solvent picks up with the
exception of fatty acids and grease com-

From the cleaning machine the suit
passes to the extractor, to the tumbler,
is inspected and assembled, thence to be
pressed. There are four pressing ma-

The total capacity of cleaning for one
day is approximately 200 suits.

last Tuesday, November 19, but

and belted back, and on the breast
are the letter “D’’ and the class

The purchase was handled by a
committee consisting of Bill Mer-
chant, Bud Okey, Mal Grimes, Bill
