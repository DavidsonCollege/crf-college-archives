Blatant propaganda smears Update

he last issue of the Davidson Up-
ii date claims on page one, ‘‘We’re .
No. 1 in Art.’’ The headline on page four
retreats a little: ‘‘We’re Number One in
Prints and Drawings.”’

In the text, the hyperbole is relieved:
we have the largest print and drawing
competition in the country.

The point I hope to make concerns the
Update, but first I want to digress into
the question of Davidson and Art. As far
as I can tell, art has always been a step-
child of the Davidson tradition, largely
tolerated when not ignored. The art
department and art major are relatively
quite young.

Art has very little to do with the
traditional formation of a Davidson
man. Art challenges values, it is not
systematic or reducible, it can be anar-
chic, it is non-discursive, it does not im-
prove GRE scores or medical school ac-
ceptances.

It is painful to think of how far from
Number One in art Davidson is. David-

son makes Bob Jones University look
like Florence, Italy.
j 0 ona S art program is as
good as it is because people like
Herb Jackson have forced it to be, in
spite of the hostile environment. I am
sure that Professor Jackson apprecia-
ted the administration’s pat on the back
for his hard work and for the success of
the National, but I imagine that he
would prefer that they give him a place
to display Davidson’s permanent collec-
tion--Chamber’s Banquet Hall, for in-
stance. To my knowledge, the ad-
ministration has simply allowed that
urgent plea to die from neglect. .
The Update treatment of art is only
one instance of a general tendency to ac-
centuate the positive and to wish the
negative out of existence. In other
words, to ignore the real.
This is not necessarily a failing,
because the Update, ‘The Official
Newspaper of Davidson College,”’ is not

- intended to be an objective reporter. It

Diligent Senators deserve attention

There are a number of Senators
who do not receive headlines, but
who work hard and enjoy ‘their
present positions. In 1944, one of

_ these senators was a fellow named
Harry Truman.

Truman felt he had found a
Satisfying position in the Senate and
looked no higher. His obtaining the
Vice Presidency and the Presidency
was not completed by his desires and
efforts.

The quiet senators are not all har-
dworking, but a hardworking fairly
low profile senator should receive at-
tention. No one is building a cam-
paign base for William Proxmire (D-
Wis.), one of the hardest working
members of the Senate.

Proxmire is an individual who jogs
miles to work, foils hold-up men who
have tried to rob him on two oc-
casions, gets hair transplants, fights

Carol Watkins

for frugality in government spen-
ding, and praises the Pentagon when
it does cut costs.

He is an alert, intelligent, and
energetic person. No one is beating
the drum for Proxmire.

n the other hand, Senator
O Lloyd Bentson (D-Tex.) was
being touted for President the first
day of his election as a senator. Most
of us are uninvolved enough not to
consider how a millionaire in-
surance-real estate man becomes a
Presidential contender so quickly.
Perhaps the key ingredient is am-
bition.

Lloyd Bentson served in Congress
for a while and tired of it. His life
does not show an involvement with
national or international issues (with
the exception of banking).

While election*laws may regulate

the amount of spending in a cam-
paign they do not control money
spent on a recognized campaign. In-
terviews, television appearances,
press conferences, etc., etc., have not
served to educate Senator Bentson on
our problems, but they have given us
exposure to him.

Senator Bentson has never exuded
charisma, never appeared com-
«mitted to any philosophy, and yet af-
ter a brief stay in the Senate, he of-
fers himself as a presidential can-
didate.

A man should not be refused office
because he is ambitious, but it should
not be his main quality.

t may be extremely difficult to

I get into the United States

Senate without being ambitious.

However, there are levels of am-.
bitiousness.

ARA ticket system burdens

ecently the ARA Slater Food
R' Service, prompted by financial
reverses due to rising prices,
looking-for a way torecoup losses.
Food Service ‘Director Ron Scott
called together a group of students to
discuss the problem. Several alter-
natives were explained by Scott, and the
students left with the impression that he
planned to close Rusk House for the
remainder of spring term.

During the course of the meeting, one
issue came up which was of interest to
me-- the fate of freshmen women under
the meal ticket system. Looking at any
announcement sheet under the For Sale
category you will never fail to notice,
‘Meal Tickets: Very Cheap. Call Watts
155 and ask for Mary.”

Freshmen with smaller appetites,
many but not all of them women, are
forced to pay for many more meal
tickets than they could possibly use.
This can be quite a financial burden on
some parents.

In order to find out what the freshmen
inhabitants of Watts really felt about the
meal ticket system and the closing of
Rusk House, I took a poll last Monday.
Forty-two girls, almost half of the num-
ber in Watts responded.

The closing of Rusk House would not
change their eating habits substantially.

was

They eat an average of 1.3 times per.

week at Rusk, and more than half vir-
tually never eat there. However, the
majority objected to the closing of Rusk
House, many citing the overcrowding of
the other two houses.

When asked if they would prefer the
closing of Rusk to a hike in price of 10%
at all, houses, the vast majority
preferred the closing of Rusk.

hen asked about the selling of
Weal tickets, many women ex-
pressed discontentment with the current
syStem.° They have sold an average of
eight méal tickets per person this year,

but many people said that they would .

have.sold more if they could have gotten
a higher price for them.

Several people on financial aid felt
that the meal tickets placed a hardship
on them.

is pe to get people to give their
money to us, a worthy enough end, I sup-
pose, because we undoubtedly need a lot
of money.

My quarrel is with the means, rather
than the end. I shall soon be a Davidson
alumnus, God willing. This will make
me prey to those PR fellows who will be
after my money.

Every couple of months I shall receive
an Update and read of Davidson’s
“position as one of the country’s leading
art colleges,”’ of its brilliant professors
and brilliant students. I shall admire the
photos of Davidson’s comeliest co-eds,
and I ‘shall be invited to Alumni
Weekend, Homecoming, etc., ‘‘for lots
of back-slapping reunions, and a potful
of fun and entertainment.”’

In short, I shall be reassured con-
stantly that Daivdson is everything it
claims to be, and mors

do not anticipate having any cash
I to give Davidson for a number of
years, if ever. If I ever do give to David-
son, it will be in spite of their propagan-
da, not because of it. At least I hope that
I shall still have enough critical in-
telligence left at that time to remember
the discrepancy between the Davidson I
read about and the one that I know.

I genuinely like the real Davidson,
with all of its peculiarities and sins, but
it has little jin common with the image
the Alumni Office creates.

I can speak only for myself, and
perhaps eventually I shall end up
romanticizing my experience of David-
son to the point of accepting the Up-
date’s picture of things.

I would, suggest, -however, that a
publication which attempted to be more
realistic and down-to-earth, and less the
journalistic back-slapping variety,
would come closer to eliciting my sym-
pathy and funds. Perhaps they could at
least be a little more subtle in their
nremotion

I concede that I may be entirely wrong
on the effectiveness of more or less
blatant propaganda. In any case, David-
son is not number one in art, and I resent
such a claim by the organ of an admin-
istration which will not respond to
a desperate need for gallery space.

appetite could opt to buy fewer meal
tickets. A large majority of the women
said that they would have liked to be
able to do this.

When asked if they approved of the
overall performance of the Slater meal
system, the majority replied that they
did not like it.

his survey dealt with the fresh-

man women who are a rela-

tively.new phenomenon on the Davidson

campus. They felt that the meal ser-
vices were geared toward the men.

They could not pay for only the
amount of food they wanted and could
not eat the foods they wanted. I believe
that Ron Scott could make an accurate
approximation of the number of fresh-
men who would want the mini-plan.

Next year, due to the large number of
upper classmen who will be _ in-
dependent, the ARA houses will be
crowded anyway, so I doubt that the
mini-plan would cause ARA to lose any
money.

Upperclassmen can go to a cash basis
or simply pay more for their meal
tickets. it 1s ulllair Lu Turce tne freshmen
to subsidize the upperclassmen. .

In addition, this system would lead to
less waste. Some freshmen buy more
food than they really want simply
because they have so many extra:
tickets. /

Even if larger, long range changes are
not made, it would be relatively easy to
give us some of the food we want. A com-:
plete salad bar at a reasonable cost
would be a good start.

The women at Davidson aren’t asking
for preferential treatment, and we don’t
want it. What we want is a chance for

' equal treatment. It is time that ARA

realized that this is now a-eoed school. .
