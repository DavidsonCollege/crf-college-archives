EDITORIAL

Due to the continued absence of Dave, Roberts on account of sickness
Dwight Chalmers has been elected Editor-in-Chief Pro Tem.

Hurry back, Dave, and put the “Dave” in Davidsonian.

“Secret practice,” like secret diplomacy, doesn’t get you to the goal.

WE RESOLVE:

To know every man on the campus

by Thanksgiving. Do you?

Men of Rumple, why follow in the paths of your elders who have gone

wrong across the campus? '

?

A BURNING QUESTION. ;
Is there any fundamental difference between stealing information from an-
other fellow's paper and stealing light from a whole dormitory hall?

We've heard that Tigers are hard to beat, but something tells us that
t

Wildcats can do the job.

WE WONDER

If there was music in the air when the Fresh picked cotton for the Band.

The unanswerable argument in favor of making Davidson a co-ed college
is that we would then get shower baths in Chambers. May they soon come!

Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.

S

OME MEN are interested in their room-mate and they are bigger men for
that interest. Some men are working for the welfare of a college organi-
zation and they inevitably become the leaders of that organization. Some

men carry a whole college on their hearts, and their names are written on every
page of its history. Some men are interested only in themselves and their fives
are as barren as the desert.

A man is no bigger than the thing he is interested in. He who looks only
after Number One soon becomes all the numeral implies—one horse, one-sided,
one friend (himself). Have we ever stopped and analyzed our activities for
one day? How many of them are directed for our sole benefit? How many
include our room-mate? How many our whole college? Does the fact that
our room-mate finds Math hard affect our conduct? Does it matter to us that
“The Davidsonian” needs our help? Do we care how soon the Band becomes a
reality? Are we interested to know that our literary societies are below the
standard ?

Is there anything more pitiful than a college man who .measures every
action by its utility to himself alone? Is not.such a man more useless than a
tramp or criminal? The law of conduct is as inexorable as the law of gravita-
tion, and applies even in college circles, “He that would be chiefest among

you, let him be servant of all.”

MAJ. A. L. JAMES RETURNS
FROM OVERSEAS.

Major A. L. James, ex-'o6, has re-
turned from overseas, where his services
gained great distinction for him in Eng-
land, France and Belgium, as well as
in America. Of him the Dubuque
(Iowa) Daily News said recently:

“Dubuque is being honored this sum-
mer by a visit of a gallant and distin-
guished soldier, one whose services in
the great war were noticed by com-
manders and kings, one who was high
in the councils of the American army.
Major Alexander Long James, who is
spending a leave of absence at ‘Four
Mounds,’ the home of his father-in-
law, Mr. George A. Burden, was chief
of the Fourth Division of the Intelli-
gence Section of the General Staff in
France. ‘The Stars and Stripes,’ the
official newspaper of the A. E. F., was
published by his division. This paper
reached

was chief military censor of the A. E.
F. and all the press, postal, telegraph
and cable censorship was conducted un-
der his direction. The propaganda con-
ducted against the enemy was likewise
one of the functions of his division. He
also controlled sub-divisions which were
charged with the entertainment and
management of all visitors to the A. E.
F., with securing and producing photo-
graphic and pictorial records of the
war, and with the necessary co-opera-
tion with the committee an public infor-
mation and its work in Europe.
“Major James has been conspicuous-
ly honored, having received the order
‘of officers of the Crown from the King
of the Belgians, the order of the chev-
alied de la legion l’honneur from the
French government and a citation from
the American commander-in-chief, Gen.
John J. Pershing, for especially conspic-
uous and meritorious services rendered.
“Major James married Miss Viola

OPEN FORUM

H. A. Hill, Acting Editor.

The Forum is the department in our
paper which is open to everybody for
discussion of any topic pertaining to
student life. Opinions, ideas, and \Sug-
gestions—cither constructive or de-
structive —-on campus improvements,
college activities, student body policies
or any other subject are welcomed by
the Forum editor. By putting up to
the public any problem of student life,
thought on that problem is encouraged,
and very likely right conclusions will
soon be reached. The alumni are also
urged to keep the old college in mind,
and to send us any advice or suggestions
they believe helpful to Davidson. All
communications to the Forum must of
course bear the signature of the author,
though it will not be published if he so
desires.

Comparative Impressions.

(Editor's note: There are at David-
son a number of men who came here
after two or three years spent at other
colleges. It is our purpose to have them
tell us through the “Forum” how Da-
vidson’s customs and ideals compare
with those of the colleges they have for-
saken).

“PEP” 1S THE TEST.

A man who goes to college naturally
has some kind of an ideal, in his mind,
of what that college ought to be. These
ideals of course vary with different types
of fellows, but I feel safe in saying that
the majority of college men want a col-
lege that has a strong atmosphere of
real, live, wide-awake interest in both
work and every form of college life.

In other words, a college should have
an outstanding spirit of “push,” and not
merely an atmosphere of tolerance for
study, athletics, and other college activi-
ties. If the “other fellow” means busi-
ness, and you see it by his actions, then
you soon realize that it's up to you to
“get busy” if you want company. The
fellow who is busy, and is interested in
his business, hasn’t any time to waste on
the one who has no business, or who
doesn’t want ‘anything to do. This very
characteristic of “pep” in both studies
and athletics, is, perhaps, the most satis-
fying characteristic that I have found
at Davidson in the few weeks that I
have been here.

After all, it takes “pep” in everything
to make a college what it ought to be
and Davidson has it.

“BILL.”

TRUE DAVIDSON.

Let's see what Davidson really means.
First of all, Davidson is indeed very for-
tunate in being located in the wonder-
ful Piedmont section of North Carolina,
She is only a little way from Charlotte,
resting peacefully among the large oaks
and on the beautiful campus which has
been instrumental in making her fa-
mous.

Let’s not attempt to compare David-
son with other colleges, for there is not
any comparison. She is the home of that
sterling quality of “Brotherhood and
Christian spirit’ that means so much to
every college. So many times colleges
lack this oné step in its curriculum of
preparing men for the best there is in
life. Often jealousy, envy and strife is
acquired in college that follows through-
out life, always leaving a blot or scar
on character. Davidson’s watchword is
“Help someone.”

Davidson College stands for the best
there is in man. This can be verified
by anyone coming on the campus for just
five minutes. Speak to a man from Da-
vidson and you will at once realize the
fact. This is quite evident from the fact
that the student body has grown to such
an enormous extent in the last few
years.

With the splendid record of the past
and the glorious future watch Davidson

grow.

ORGANIZED READING.

“Reading makes the full man,” said
one of the greatest essayists. “But what
shall I read?” is the question that con-
fronts every man who wshes to make a
selection from the twenty-seven thou-

' Here one may find volumes of ancient
| and modern history, all branches of
‘science, poetry and the best works of
imodern novelists. A student should
plan a course of reading and should try
to read at least one book every two
weeks, Select the books that fit in best
with the course you are pursuing in col-
lege but by no means confine yourself to
one particular line of reading. Try to
become acquainted with all accepted
| standard works and writers.

The reading room contains the best
standard periodicals and every student
should make it a part of his daily sched-
ule to visit the reading room and famil-
iarize himself with current topics.

READ “THE OLD MADHOUSE.”
WILLIAM DE MORGAN.

Vinson,

Wood,

To those who have reveled in the de-
lightful originality of plot, the remark-
able character portrayal and amusing
dialogue of “Alice for Short,” “Some-
how Good” and “It Never Can Happen
Again,”’ comes another treat from that
beloved author—the last work of his pen
before his death. The Old Madhouse
was published by Mrs. De Morgan and
is fresh from the press this month. Read-
ers of De Morgan will find in this novel
no weakening of the author's grasp of
plot, no dimming of his keen insight into
human nature, whether he is telling us
of Grewbeer, the drunken caretaker of
the mysterious and creepy old place, or
of the beautiful Lucy Hinchliffe, who
came there to live. He uses his same
original and entertaining method of
describing places in the language of the
people who dwell there. If he has oc-
casion to write of a London slum he

does so in the Cockney vocabulary and,

accent of the London slum dweller.
There is something irresistably refresh-

OUT OF LUCK.

Afraid to breathe, almost, the returned
reveller crept quietly into his bedcham-
ber as the gray dawn was breaking. Sit-
ting on the edge of the bed, he cautious-
ly undid his boots. But, with all his
care, his wife stirred in bed, and he pres-
ently was all too well aware of a pair,
of sleepy eyes regarding him over the
edge of the sheet.

“Why, Tom,” yawned the little wo-
man, “how early you are this morning!”

“Yes, mv dear,” replied Tom, stifling
a groan, “I’ve got to go to Montreal for
the firm today.”

And replacing his footgear the wretch-
ed man dragged his aching limbs out
again into the cold and heartless streets.

Duke's life.”

“How is that, Cindy,” queried her
employer.

“I dunno how they done it. Only he
wrote me a postal card sayin’ if he
hadn't got ten days in one of 'em he'd ‘a

A HARD LIFE.

“Arabella,” Kenneth softly whisper-
ed to her, “I am going to tell you some-
thing. I do not know just how you
will receive it, but hope for the best.
For some time it has been in my heart
to tell you of it, but I had not the cour-
age. Arabellla—”

“Yes, yes, go on,” the girl murmur-
ed, the third finger of her left hand
itching perceptibly.

“It's this, then: The last buss leaves
