EX-GOVERNAR GLENN
FOUND DEAD IN BED
IN CANADA, SUNDAY, MAY 16

Ex-Governor R. B. Glenn of the
class of was found dead in bed
at the Royal Alexandria hotel, Win-
nepeg, Canada. Death was due to
heart disease. Governor Glenn had
gone to Canada as a member of the
International Boundary Commis-
sion. The funeral service was
conducted in Winston-Salem at the
Presbyterian church by Dr. D. Clay
Lilly, the pastor and Dr. Neal Ander-
‘son. Governor Bickett, Secretary
Lacy and many other notables were
present at the funeral.

The death of Mr. Glenn came as a
severe shock to his many friends
throughout the state and the nation.
He had been in ill health for some
time and a trained nurse who had
been attending him for the past year
was the only one present when
death came.

On two occasions within the last
few years he had been very close to
death's door, his doctor having
warned him of the danger of over-
exertion.

While Governor of North Caro-
lina the Tar Hee! state enjoyed one

of the best administrations of its|N

history. Davidson College numbers
him among the first of its greatest
alumni. The heart of the college
goes out to the family in Winston-

Salem and we with them feel our|C.

loss keenly.

JOHN ALLEN THAMES
HONORED.

John Allen Thames, 18, now a
student at the Georgetown Univer-
sity Law School, Washington, D. C.,
was awarded the prize of $50 for
being the best debater in the recent

rize contest. The University week-
ly paper in commenting on this said

the contest each year.

CLASS OF °15 FULL OF “PEP.”

There were about 20 members of
the class of 1915 present during
commencement. They were meet-
ing in their first annual meeting
and were full of “pep.” Fifteen put
out some fine men in the different
branches of college activity. F. W.
Price was the first editor-in-chief
| of The Davidsonian and associated
himself efficiently with almost every
organization not only in the college,
but the town, being principal of the
City high school during his Senior
year. “Pete” Crayton, our ex-coach,
was one of the best athletes here
during his stay. J. E. Harper was
editor of the Magazine. The class
as a whole is an excellent one and
their spirit and interest offers won-
derful support to the college.

ALUMNI RECEPTION
VERY SUCCESSFUL

Library Beautifully Decorated for
the jon.

The reception for the Alumni,
Trustees, and visiting friends by the
President and Faculty Tuesday
afternoon was a delighttul occasion.
The Library was tastefully arrang-
ed and showed an even more won-
derful exhibition of beauty, com-
bined with neatness, than usual. Ice
cream and cake was served and
rapidly disappeared in spite of the
cool weather. This reception fur-
nished an admirable opportunity for
the Alumni and others to meet to-
gether as they did in former days.

Devotional News

SAD
FAREWELL

Has Served the Institution Faith-
fully During Last Eighteen
Months.

Every Davidson man grieves at
Bob Miles’ leaving Davidson. For
a year and a half he has been our Y.
M. C. A. super-secretary. Coming’
just at the end of the S. A. T. C. in
the fall of 1918, he has since that
time endeared himself to every man
on the campus. And as he goes to
be assistant pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church in Greensboro,
he takes with him the prayers of us
all that his work there may he as
happily successful as has been his
service here. He leaves a hole that
will be hard to fill.

A devoted piety that goes all
through his daily life is one of the
reasons why Bob Miles has been so
potent a power for good. Yet he is
“hail fellow well met’ with every
man on the campus. His gift of be-
ing a friend is little short of mar-
velous. As the chief executive of
religious work among the students
he has shown an efficiency far from
ordinary; he has put a vivid life in-
to the “Y” organization which it
never had before. To-every man on
the campus he has been a friend
whose ready sympathy has been
ever a source of help and comfort.

the Phi Hall and at the Y. M. C. A.| THE COLLEGE BIDS BOB
MILES A

Davidson's first coach for basket-.

ball was Bob Miles. Always inter-
ested in athletics, an old basketball
star, having been captain of the
team, he took charge of basketball
and did some splendid work, though
lack of material was a great hind-
rance and prevented the successful
season that would undoubtedly
otherwise have resulted from his
painstaking and skillful efforts.
Regret at Bob Miles’ leaving is
a feeling confined to a circle of his
particular friends. This, however,
simply means that every Davidson
man is a friend of his. From a
selfish standpoint we view with the
utmost regret his departure. But,
great as is his services here we be-
lieve that he goes to a greater.

EXCELLENT WORK OF “y.”

Put _Sunday Schools and Bible
Classes on Fne Basis Last Year.
Also Secured Many Prominent

Speakers.

The record of the Davidson Y.
M. C. A. for the spring term of the
year 1919-20 shows that the Asso-
ciation must redouble its efforts if
it is to give in the way of regular
work in Bible classes and Sunday

Schools anything like as much as It,

has received in the way of inspira-
tion from the messages that have
been brought to it by others.

During the twenty Sundays of
the year, it has had eight messages
by prominent ministers and mis-
sionaries ; four talks by its own be-
loved general secretary; three ad-
dresses by members of the faculty ;
two meetings led by its members,
one for the report of its delegates
to the great Des Moins Volunteer
Convention and one for the inau-
guration of its 1920-1921 officers;
one wonderful Sunday with the
State Volunteer Conference; and
certainly its greatest meeting led by
W. G. Summerville, 16, and J. L.
Fowle, ’18 (both from Union Sem-
inary) when at least a dozen fellows
accepted the challenge of the Gospel
ministry.

The Bible classes have meant a
great deal to those who have taken
an active interest in them. But the
great shame of the year is that so
few of the fellows have really gone
to work, the average recorded at-
tendance being only 27 per cent of
the student body.

There is room for a great im-
provement in the country Sunday

chool work, especially in the mat-
ter of regularity, though of course
the influenza quarantine necessarily
broke up the work to a certain ex-
tent. The average recorded attend-

ance of regular members is 205, of

The “Y” has also done a fine
social work through the recreation
room and movies. Far greater than
what has already been accomplished
is the work which the Association
has been prepared to do with the
undivided attention of a permanent
general secretary and the unquali-
fied support of every member.

THE BEST PATH
LEADS TO
BLUE RIDGE

Davidson Wants You to Take it

Fellows, don’t stop thinking about
the Blue Ridge Conference, June 15,
at Black Mountain. It is not too
late yet to register, and Davidson
should have its full quota. If you
decide to go, after reaching home,
write Mr, Miles here at Davidson.
Talk it over with your parents.
Those ten days at Blue Ridge will
be the best you have ever spent. It
is a duty to yourself to go there, for
the high ideal it will set before you.
It is a duty to the other fellows
around you, for it will better enable
you to serve humanity.

Don’t forget Blue Ridge!

SENIORS PRESENT
COLLEGE WITH SUN-DIAL

Class Day Exercises Held in Front
of Library.

On Monday afternoon the twenty-
fourth of May the Senior class, amid
the loud reports of pistols and amid
the music furnished by the David-
son Band, marched from beneath
the shadows of Shearer Hall for
their Class Day Exercises. The line
of fifty Seniors wearing caps and
gowns and led by the president of
the class, W. F. Hall and the little
curly haired mascot, Frank Jackson,
Jr., who also wore a tiny cap and
gown, marched over to the flag pole
and formed a large circle about it
while a huge white banner bearing
the numerals 1920 was hoisted. The
line then proceeded to the Library
and the Seniors seated themselves
on the steps facing the audience
who stood on the grass directly in
front.

After a few opening remarks by
W. F. Hall the Satutatorian of the:
class, W. B. Sullivan, was announc-
ed. He made an excellent speech
of invitation and welcome to the
visitors, This was followed by the
class history by the historian, T. H.
Spence. He followed up in a de-
lightfully humorous way the four
years of college life even to the
midnight raids on Dr. Harding's
strawberry patch, and ended up with
the prophesy, “Look out old world
after next Wednesday.” H. C. Ham-
ilton then recited the class poem
which was followed by the class
oration by C. A. McGirt. McGirt
well upheld the honor bestowed on
him of class orator. The sundial, the
class gift, was then presented by
R. T. L. Liston with appropriate
words, hoping that the future
classes of Davidson would have
many hours filled with sunshine and
happiness. The Book of the Classes
containing the autograph of each
Senior was then presented to the
Junior class by the president of the
Senior class, and J. R. Boulware in
behalf of the junior class excepted
it with a brief word of thanks. R.
R. Craig then made the Salutatory
address. He expressed the classes’
deep appreciation to the Faculty for
their ceaseless efforts and hoped
that the future students would ever
keep before them the old Davidson
spirit.

W. F. Hall then made a few re-
marks expressing the class’ ap-
preciation of the good attendance
and the Class Day Exercises of the
class of ’20 was brought to a close.
