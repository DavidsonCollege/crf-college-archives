Examinations Can Become
A. Sporting Proposition

The littl man with the horn-
rimmed glasses drew deeply from
his pipe, then added to the already
smoke-filled room. Around the
room the other four men looked
silently at him waiting patiently
for his next words. From his over-
stuffed chair he spoke precisely and
clearly, choosing his words care-

other three men who were casually
leaning against the wall. “Be sensi-
ble and think this matter over. We
all come from different walks of
life but we have this thing in com-
mon. We each have a group of men
working under us. Why should we
try to get rid of these men when
they are our bread and life? It
would be hurting ourselves to cause
their downfall.”

“Now gentlemen.” It was the
one with the horn-rimmed glasses
who spoke again. “Surely our friend
here is getting unnecessarily ex-
cited, All I'm asking is are there
any of you here sporting enough to
accept my little wager. And here's

my proposition—take it or leave

bled half aloud. But the beady-
eyed man was not convinced, He
shifted his gaze to the other men
as he shot up from his chair and
eagerly spoke to them.

and admit defeat the $50 is yours.”

“I'll take it,” said the tallest of
the group. “It may take me all
night to think up a method for
winning, but I accept your wager.”

Then one by one the other men
slapped their $50 down over the
original $50 of the man with the
horn-rimmed glasses. The beady-
eyed one was the last to accept, but
finally even he entered the game.

The religionist feels satisfied if
every man has some sort of god.
The Christian’s one concern—which
he feels is God's concern too—is
that men ‘should not worship false
gods but should know their real
sonship in their belief and accept-
ance of Christ Himself—not just
His teachings alone.

When you say Christianity is
better, what do you mean? How
do’ you know that your yardstick
for the measurement is valid? In
most instances, your choice in mat-
ters is made in the light of certain
ideals or principles you have already
accepted. Each time you make a
choice, you only affirm once more
your loyalty to these ideals. If you
say you choose to believe in God
because that belief is more reason-
able, are you not professing a faith
in your reason rather than in God?

“What right have we to preach
our religion to those who have their
own?” But to ask this question is
actually to, ask, “What right has
God to love man?” or “By what
right does God dare to offer us any
rescue from sin?” But we are not
dealing with anybody's right, but
Love.

No, it is not a question of “force,”
or the claim of “better” for the
person captured by Christ and His
Love. He naturally desires to
serve God and obey His command-

ment to preach to the whole world.
The Christian realizes that the com-
pletion of the evangelistic task by
those who are already members of
the new humanity is a part of God’s
purpose for mankind. Is any other
task more challenging and liberat-

European Travel
Offered In Autos
At Student Rate

Students interested in touring
Europe at a low-cost student rate
in Ford automobiles should con-
tact John Lindmarker who is stu-
dent agent for the Scandinavian
Student Travel Service.

The tour has a new angle in
that the tourist can specify
what type of activity in Europe
he would like to observe and
the auto in which he travels
can be routed that way.

All drivers are picked by the
travel service and are trained in
handling the varying languages and
currencies.

The plan was devised to open
travel opportunities to students and
young teachers whose resources
were limited both as to time and
finances.

of getting a new catalogue out.

Another matter under considera-
tion is the listing of the professors.
In the current issue they are listed.

has been given to listing them in
alphabetical order and possibly
shifting the place of the list to a
different location in the catalogue.

the new book was due. to be in the Shows Start at 3 p.m.

duction is “a little behind sched-/f MON.-TUE., JAN. 21-2

Extensive Research og

In preparation for the revising,
Dr. Spencer has done extensive re-
search and comparison of other
college ¢atalogues. It was found
that Davidson’s was somewhat
smaller than those published by
most other institutions.

Dean Brown pointed out that a
catalogue has three principle func-
tions. They are to advertise the
college to prospective students, to
provide a handbook to those con-
nected with Davidson and to serve
as a permanent record of the in-
formation contained in ifs pages.

Members of the committee for
revision are Dean Brown, chair-
