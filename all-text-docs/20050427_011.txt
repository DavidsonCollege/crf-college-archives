_ Dear Sarah,

We are so proud of your accomplishments over
the past four years. You tackled challenging
classes, the rigors of dorm life, assorted injuries,

, Numerous trips to the emergency room for
yourself and your friends and even a close
encounter with a fire extinguisher head on. You
managed to fit the contents of an apartment into
a small dorm room with amazing results. Along the
way you had some great times and developed
wonderful friendships. All of these
accomplishments will be invaluable as you move
ahead. Happy Graduation!

Love Mom, Dad, Matthew, Seth, Sam, Ebony, Ariel,
Maddie, Max, and Bella

Congratulations, Jeffrey Kuykendall
