It’s a wonderful field they have down in
the millionaire’s playground. However, the
Davidson squad got a little accustomed to
ithat treatment in the Battery Park at Ashe-

Trinity's two touchdown margin over the
Richmond Spiders raised the standing of
Jones’ club somewhat.

The standing of the North Carolina foot-

First-year Men Encounter Best

The Wildkittens, their appetites only par-
tially appeased by the blood of Monroe,
Wingate and P. C., are ready and eager for
their battle with the Clemson Tiger Cubs
next Friday. The game will be played
either here (or in Charlotte).

The Fresh have given undeniable evidence |
that they are a bloodthirsty crew. Their |

rated as the best in South Carolina, proved
Following the examp!e
set by their big brothers, the future Wild-
cats have, in the three games already played,
kept their goal uncrossed.

The Clemson Yearlings are also credited
with having a lively team. With a 170-pound
line, a very fast backfield and an abundance
of new plays and shifts, they present a very
formidable appearance. In their game with
the South Carolina Freshmen Saturday, they
sprung a surprise in the last quarter when,
after trailing for three periods, they un-
corked a series of plays and shifts that
swept the offense completely off their feet.
Making 14 first downs in 10 minutes, they

those that showed up well. .

finished the game on the long end of a
13-6 score.

Their new “Crap Shooter’s Shift” com-
pletely bewildered the South Carolina Bid-
dies, who were unable to solve it.

The Davidson team goes into action with
virtually the same team that they met P. C.
last week. Grey and Melton suffered severe
charley-horses and Gibson and Nesbit were
slightly injured. All four are expected to
be in the game Friday, however.

The probable line-up will be:

The officials will be: Van Sant (N. C.

N. C. State, and Carolina), head linesman.

It seems that the P. C. crowd came forth
with the pre-game dope that the margin that
the P. C. Freshmen beat the Davidson
Freshmen would be the margin that the P. C.
Varsity would beat the Davidson Varsity in
1925. Davidson won, 14-6. That statement
sounds good!

Wick Black has made good his last six
try-for-point trials. Popsy has sent over
four straight placements also.
