LAST WORDS OF THE
DEPARTING EDITORS

* * *

If you spent thirty

Hours each week, col-

Lecting material for

‘The paper, and editing

It, trying to keep in

Mind the caution of some
Kindly souls who admonished
You to “Make it a literary
Success,” and of some

Others to run lots of

Silly jokes, and yet others

‘To be sure to side

In with the

Faculty; and at the

Same time to agree

With students that the

Members of that

August body are a

Lot of dead ones;

Trying to keep enough bas-
Ketball news to sat-

Isfy the team and boost
Orchestra, glee club and
Literary societies ; clamor-

Ing for student

Articles and then having to refuse
To print many of them be-
Cause of their “unprintableness’—
Then, ves then, we say

If, after this, the

Issue does

Come forth, and

You bethink you of the hour left
Wherein to study for

‘The cighteen hours’ work

You carry,

And find that you must spend them in
The office

In endeavor to explain

To some why

You must print the

Trash that others

Shouted for, or

Wait with loaded gun

Till you've explained to

Some irate con-

Tributor just why

His article does not

Appear on the

Front page, or

Why a Student Forum

DO YOU WANT A SPRING
