Cats look for third straight win at USC;

meet the UNCC Green Machine

The surging Davidson Wild-
cats face two stern tests this
week in South Carolina and
UNCC, following two straight
impressive victories over confe-
rence opponents.

Last Monday night, the Cats
knocked off the Moccassins of
UT-Chattanooga by a 70-64
score. A crowd of approximate-
ly 3,000 turned out for the final
Johnston Gym appearance of
seniors John Gerdy and Pat
Hickert. Gerdy treated the
crowd to one of his finest
performances by scoring 36
points (his highest total ever at
Johnston Gym) and grabbing
seven rebounds.

The Cats trailed 36-33 at
halftime, as Chattanooga’s Nor-
man Anchrum penetrated the
Davidson defense for several
easy baskets. With 15:32 left in
the second half, UT-C led 44-40.
From that point on, however, it
was all Davidson.

An aggressive defensive ef- .

fort by the Cats held Chatta-
nooga without a field goal for
eight minutes, and the lead
changed hands.. With 7:57 left,
Davidson moved ahead by se-
ven. Chattanooga’s hopes for a
rally were dashed by another
drought of 3:20 without a field

Meanwhile, Gerdy hit his last
nine shots from the floor to ice
the game for the Cats. In
addition to Gerdy’s perfor-
mance, Todd Haynes had 22
points and eight rebounds, as
he and Gerdy combined for 31 of
Davidson’s 37 second half
points. The Cats finished their
Southern Conference season
with. a 3-7 record.

The Chattanooga game fol-
dowed a devastating Davidson
triumph over VMI in a regional-
ly televised game last Saturday.
The Cats picked up their first
road win of the season by

featuring a balanced offensive

‘attack. Gerdy, Haynes, and

Brian Rowan combined for 46
points, and Jamie Hall domina-
ted the boards with 14 re-
bounds. The final score was
81-54.

On Saturday Davidson will
again play. in a regionally
televised game, facing the
Gamecocks of South Carolina in
Columbia. USC features 6’9”’
forward Cedric Hordges, guard
Zam Frederick, and Furman
transfer Jim Strickland, who
have led the Gamecocks to yet
another winning season. USC

will be out to avenge last
season’s loss to Davidson in
Charlotte.

Monday night, the Cats take
on ‘cross-town rival UNC-Char-
lotte at the Coliseum. The 49ers
are 12-9 for the season, led by

guard Chad Kinch and forward —

Phil Scott.

A sellout crowd is expected
for the first meeting ever be-
tween the two teams. Over
4,000 UNC-Charlotte students
are expected to attend, so a
good student turnout by David-
son will be important.

Cattes lose to Gardner-Webb and
Duke; to play UNC-G at home

By ROB GILLISON
Asst. Sports Editor

The Lady Cagers suffered
two losses this week, lowering
their record to 3-16.

The first game was a 70-48
loss to Gardner-Webb. Trailing
47-14 at the half, the girls
played an impressive second
half by using the running game
to outscore their opponents.

Unfortunately, it was not e-
nough.

Monday, the girls traveled to
Duke. The final score was 78-25
in favor of the Blue Devils.
Sarah Womack had: 12 points
and Donna Ferren added 8
more.

The girls close the regular
season with a home game
against UNC-Greensboro on
Friday, Fébruary 16.

From the looks of things, this shot did not become two of John
(ierdy's 36 points against UT-Chattanooga.

Swim team takes 12-3 record to S.C. championships

Devotion. It’s that one ele-
ment in the Sportsworld that
makes men out of boys, makes
the shins of swimmers bleed.

In what might seem an ex-
treme sign of devotion to some,
the Davidson swim team is
carefully shaving down in pre-
paration. for the Conference
meet at Furman this weekend.
Shaving down eliminates drag
(friction) in the water. Swim-
mers are willing to sacrifice
their body hair, along with a
few knicks and cuts, to the
Swim God who lives in the
depths of Lake Norman. Iii this

way; the Wildcats will be
granted faster times. What
higher force motivates these
Davidson gentlemen to aspire
to such a routine? Devotion.

By far her most devoted team
in her five years as coach, Pat

Miller’s swimmers closed out -

the regular season with a-12-3
record. In their best season yet,
the Wildcats ‘‘didn’t get beaten
badly at any time;”’ a total of
only 21 points accounted for
their three losses.

The Catfishs’ biggest loss
came last weekend against
Georgia State. With a 42-37
lead, “all hell broke loose” and

the last three events. It is not
that they were swimming poor-
ly, Georgia State happened to
be particularly strong in those
events.

Mike Shremmer took first

place in the thousand free,
breaking the school record with
a time of 10;13.38. Mark Tom-
merdahl placed second in that
event and first in the 200 fly.
Paul Voight and Craig Allen
finished first and second in the
100 free. Freshman Warren

Beck broke the school record in’

the 200 backstroke (2:06.6).
Mrs. Miller’s Killers defeated

Emory and Georgia Tech last

weekend with little trouble.

Against Emory they took 11 of
13 first places to win 79-34.
Against Georgia Tech they took
10 of 13 first places and de-
feated the Yellow Jackets 76-37.

Coach Miller is hoping for the
“best finish we’ve ever had” at
Conference this Thursday.
Clearly, if the Catfish can
outswim archrivals Appalach-
ian and Citadel, a second place
finish seems imminent. Mar-
shall University is the only
team that stands between the
Wildcats and the Southern: Con-
ference title.

Will Pat shave her head if her
boys win Conference? She re-
fused to comment.

Any average guy will tell you that
the intellectual value of sports is
negligible. He’ll tell you how sports are
pretty much devoid of social impor-
tance. He’ll-also say that sporting
activity is just an outlet,’and that it is

far removed from the stark realities -

of life like politics, war, and pestilence.
But; I:must contend, there is a
- lurking cerebral aspect of sports that is
hidden from all but the most avid of
enthusiasts. In a word, it is trivia.

trivia in any other field. There are lists,
lineups, numbers, nicknames, myriads.
of statistics, hometowns, colleges,
broken records - so many things with
which to make questions. Sure movies
and popular music can give you a great
many obscure things to talk about; but
only in sports can so much be done with
the reams of information. The idle mind
can really havea field day

Trivia is not a truly integral part in
all sports. Basketball and football, for
instance, are fast-paced sports, with-

’ out'much idle time, and the individuals

don’t stand out quite so much because
of the team-oriented nature of the
sports. Sure, there are plenty of areas

for questions: ‘like scoring averages,

or who has committed the most fouls in

an NBA season; ‘nevertheless, trivia —
isn't really a major part of these sports.

In sports like swimming, tennis or

‘ track, trivia has also failed to become

an essential part, probably because no
one really cares about those sports

anyway.

There’s plenty of spare time between

when the manager or catcher confers
