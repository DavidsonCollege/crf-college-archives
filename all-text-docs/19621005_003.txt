BACK IN ‘26...

Time was when P.C.-Davidson games were as:much
agitated turmoil as athletic trial. In fact, back. in °26
Presbyterian officials agreed with their Davidson breth-
ren that the annual football game was predestined to
trouble.

And it didn’t take a John Calvin.
prophets in the administrative office realized the
would have to be played on neutral ground.

in characteristic (chronic) cautiousness, the pacifist
Presbyterians chose what was really neutral territory
Winthrop College in Rock Hill, South Carolina.

Rock Hill was a good gridiron community. Only the
year before, their high schoo! football team had massed
a powerhouse that walloped, among others, the UNC
freshmen, 31-0. And the local citizenry turned out a good
crowd, along with 1,800 Winthrop girls clad in blue
uniforms, and ample P.C. and Davidson contingents. (Dr.
Puckett claims attendance.)

Officials lined off the hockey field, roped the side-
lines, and the game began.

But somebody had failed to read the terms of the
peace treaty. Neutrality was forgotten and pacifism was
soon disregarded.

Dick Grey, one of the best ballplayers who ever

as

game

played for the Wildcats, put a drop kick between the}

crossbars early in the game to put Davidson out in front,
3-0.

As the game progressed, neither team seemed to
be able to score again and feeling was running high.
Penalties by the refrees were hotly contested.

Finally, about midway in the game, one of the P.C.
tackles, an all round bruiser, protested an official's call.
by silencing the official with a smashing blow, and then |

lowered the boom on his opponent.

It took the local National Guard unit, at the game in
full color in case of trouble, to separate the two teams.
When the dust had lifted, however, Grey’s field goal
proved to be the deciding factor, and the ’Cats took a
3-0 victory.

It took Davidson and P.C. twenty-three years to re-
cover from the repercussions of the riot that followed.

Recent years have been more peaceful, but not with-'
out color. It hasn’t been too long ago since freshman
Charlie Sasser chased a P.C. beanie-thief across Richard-
son Field and dumped him from behind on. the cinder
track.

Tomorrow is homecoming for P.C. It is also a big
game for the Cats. Who knows, maybe some more color.

THE CRYSTAL BALL STRIKES AGAIN

It looks like buying that old crystal ball last week
paid off even though we did miss pretty far on the Rich-
mond-VPI game. With last week’s prediction record,
which was 5-1, our overall results are now 5-3 which is a
far cry from the 0-2 record we had week before last.

It’s hard to tell who the Presbyterian God pre-
ordains to win in a clash of two Presbyterian schools, but |
in this case we feel that the Wildcats have got too much
for little P.C. The Blue Hose will go the way of Wofford.

Prediction: Davidson 20, P.C. 14.

The Furman-Richmond game will be a close one, and
both teams possess the winning potential. Furman should
come out on top, however.

Prediction: Furman 14, George Washington 7.

The Citadel was able to come out on the long end
of a 10-8 score against William & Mary last fall. This
year William & Mary, with a potentially stronger team
will be shooting for revenge.

Prediction: William & Mary 28, The Citadel 16.

VPI faces a much —, Virginia team than the
one that it spilled to a 20-0 last year. They have a

P.C. Seeks First Win
In Homecoming Tilt

Tomorrow night in Clinton, S. C., Davidson’s Wild-
cats meet the Blue Hose from Presbyterian College in

the twenty-first round of a
over forty years ago.

The first Davidson-Presbyter-
ian game was played in 1919
and since that time feelings

have been built up in this series
unrivaled by any other with the
exception of the Davidson-Wake
Forest series which ended in the
thirties.

Frequent instances of full-
scale brawls involving both
fans and players after hard-
fought contests between the
‘Cats and the Blue Hose have
been recorded. In fact, at one
time the feelings between the
two schools became so intense
that the series was dropped
for over twenty years, and was
only resumed in 1949.

The Wildeats hold an edge in
the series although neither team

has securely dominated thef”
rivalry. The Wildcats have won
10 of the contests, the Blue Hose
9, and 1 game has ended in
a tie.

Saturday night's affair with
Presbyterian should be a tough,
close game if the past is any
indication. Although the Blue
Hose haven't won a game so far
this season, “they're looking
better all the time.” according
to Coach Tom Stevens who
scouted them against The Cita
del, a game that the Blue Hose
dropped 28-8 last week

In meeting P.C. the ‘Cats

will be running up against an
entirely different kind of of
fense than they faced against
Wofford last week. The Blue
Hose run out of a wing T for-
mation, and they make good
use of their hard-hitting
squad with trapping and
power plays.

Ronnie Hampton, a
halfback, will be one the
Blue Hose’s rugning threats to
morrow. Bampton was the man
who went 75. yards against the
Cats last year to chalk up Pres
byterians only score as they lost
21-7

At quarterback the Blue Hose
will be considerably weaker
than in years past. Bobby Wat- |
ers and Bobby Joyner have mov- |
ed into pro ball, leaving the
position to relatively inexper-
ienced Bill Tyson, who has been
out the last couple of games |
because of an injury, and sopho- |
more Layton Granton, who has |
been shouldering the position
in Tyson's absence.

The defensive interior line
is a strong spot on the Blue
Hose squad with Dewey Mc-
Renolds, a guard, and Alvin
Coley, a linebacker, offering
added toughness.

“Greatest defensive effort ever.’

’ This is the way

Coach Bill Dole sized up Davidson’s performance in last
Saturday's contest with the Terriers from Wofford.

Whether or not it really was
the best defensive effort ever
coached by Dole at Davidson.

no one wil! ever know, but the
"Cats were certainly very con-
vincing in their role. Every

Wofford offensive drive came to
a “sereeching halt,” as the de
termined 'Cats dug in whenever
the ball reached Davidson terri
tory.

Particularly outstanding in
the defensive performance
put on by the ‘Cats was Tom
Ross, a senior linebacker, who
was “making tackles all over
the field.”

Davidson's offense, which
off to a shaky start in the

half, finally came to. life late
in the period when Bob Cordle
intercepted a Wofford pass and
ran it back 52 vards to the Ter-
rier 28.

A pass from Kent Tucker to
Steve Davidson put it on the one
yard line, and two plays later
Bill Dole, Jr. booted a field goal
as time ran out.

Early in the fourth quarter
the ‘Cats were finally able to
send Pat Fisher over from the
five to climax a 71 yard scor-
ing drive. Joe Jones account-
ed for the other ‘Cat tally
