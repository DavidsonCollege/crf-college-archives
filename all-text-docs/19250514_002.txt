Wake Forest Yearlings Win 3-1
Here Saturday as Joyner
Tightens in Pinches

The Davidson Freshman baseball team
closed a fairly successful season here Satur-

closed with ‘eight victories out of- fourteen |
contests.

Joyner and Poole engaged in a mound bat- |
tle during the entire nine innings, Joyner be- |
ing unusually cool-headed in the pinches, and
pitched a brand of ball that won the game |
for Wake Forest when apparently the David- |

son Wildkittens were going to score.

Several times Davidson had a chance to
tie the score and win the game. In the
fourth a man was on third and one on first,
with no outs, but the side was retired with- |
out a tally. Again, in the eighth with the |
bases full-and one out Joyner was able to re-
tire the side without a score. Both pitchers |
allowed but eight hits during the afternoon, |
one home run being garnered off each,

The closing game was one of the best |
played by any team’ on Richardson field this |
season. Box score:

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

Well, athletics are all over for the year,
and so is this the last issue of The David-
sonian. The first thing attention will be
called to in the fall will naturally be football,
and that is something that is going to require
some. writing about this next school year.

For with so many good men coming back,
and with a good supply of material coming up
rom the Freshman class, Coach Monk will
have another chance to put out the football
team he did this past year.

We hope it is going to be still better. The
team attracted south-wide attention this year,
and we want it to attract even greater atten-
tion next year.

There would be great rejoicing at David-
son if the Wildcats could defeat Wake For-
est in Charlotte next year, State here and
Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Those -would appear to be the biggest
games of the season, though the ones with
Duke here and Furman at,an unknown place
will require an expenditure of, brains and
brawn.

The baseball season ended last week with
two good games, perhaps the best of the
And Davidson almost won both of
them.

When a team plays a 11-inning game one
day, and a 13-inning battle the next day, it
speaks well for them.

Laird did some good pitching both days.
Had he been given better support in the
game with Wake Forest he would have won.
Then he pitched six innings of the Duke
game at Monroe the following day.

Vance closed the season with a batting

| average well over .400, and has brought in

many of the Davidson runs this season by
his singles, doubles, triples and home runs.

Though the baseball season was not suc-
cessful this year, it is expected that Coach
Monk will have a better supply of material
to work with next season.

The Freshmen will send several pitchers
up for Coach Monk to use. At least some
of them have been showing fairly well this
season. It remains to be seen what they
will do when they face bigger and better
teams than the Freshmen have played.

When the Wildkittens lost to Wake Forest

| Freshmen, 3 to 1, last Saturday, they lost

after a hard battle, and their season ended
then with eight victories and six defeats out
of 14 starts.

We'd like very much to see Price and

| McCutchen meet the Tulane winners of the

Southern tennis title. Somehow we were
pulling for Carolina hard in that match, for
had the Tar Heels won the doubles, then
technically Davidson Would-have been South-
ern title holders. -—™“———

Of course we cannot get into associations
whenever we want to, but we do wish that
Davidson was connected with some associa-
tion to compete each year.

Currie evidently stepped out while in
Greensboro last Saturday when he ran with
Scholtz in the 100-yard dash and 220-yard
dash. It was a great showing for him, and
Davidson is glad that she has him here.

It is said that Currie has a tendency to
break training. That being true, we believe
that with good consistent training he will
make a name for himself and Davidson that

will be eovied. by many cinderpath men over

the state and south,

Price and McCutchen proved a good com-
bination in the state tennis meet, and we
congratulate them upon bringing back the
“double crown” from Chapel Hill. Mc-
Cutchen will be here for two more years,
and according to our way of thinking he is

~ 18 East Trade Street

going to give someone a run for state singles
honors in the next two years he has to play.

Baptists Win Thriller
8-7, in Eleventh Inning

Davidson Weakens in Final Innings
After Piling up Big Lead in
First Two

In the. most exciting game of the season
Davidson was defeated last Friday by Wake
Forest to the tune of 8-7, the winning mark-
er being made in the last frame of the 11-
inning game.
| The Demon Deacons managed to push two
| runs over the plate in their half of the
| initial frame but this was overshadowed, for
when the Wildcats took the field at the begin-
ning of the second, they had placed four
counters on the right side of the ledger.
Davidson’s lead was further increased in
the second inning when Laird and Coving-
ton scampered home. In the meantime the
visitors were being held scoreless by the mas-
terful pitching of Red Laird.

Sorrels, replacing Brewton, who had been
pounded out of the box before Wake Forest
was able to put but one Davidson man out,
hurled a beautiful game of ball. He caused
an even dozen Wildcats to miss the, third
strike and was practically invincible when
men were on the paths. In addition to this
he garnered thre hits and scored a_ run.
Greason, the Deacon's second sacker, secured
three hits also and made two counters.

Laird pitched fine ball but was given poor
support when men occupied the sacks, which
kept him in a hole most of the time. He
was probably the outstanding Davidson man
of the day, since he made three hingles and
placed one run in the Davidson column. Kug-
ler, playing his first full home game at the
initial sack, put up a neat game in the field,
handling 12 chances without a miscue, and
solved Sorrell’s delivery twice. He made
a double play unassisted, the play saving the
day for Davidson for the time being.

Wake Forest tied the score and went one
run ahead in her half of the ninth, but Da-
vidson quickly knotted the score when Davis,
pinch-hitting for Glenn, secured a blow and
crossed the plate a few minutes later fol-
lowing a hit by Captain Covington.

All this was in vain for the Wake county
boys pushed a run over in the eleventh and
the home nine failed to rally sufficiently to

Davidson Golfers
Shut Out Concord

Last Wednesday afternoon the golf team
added another scalp to their strin of vic-
tories by taking the Concord Country Club
into camp. The match was featured by the
steady play of the entire team with the ulti-
mate outcome of a 9-0 victory. Canon and
Dr. Wadsworth, opposing Jones and Trotter,
were the most formidable of the foe. In the
second round they forced the latter to exert
considerably to win.

Milhous and Reeves had a thirty-six for
the day’s low score which was two below par
for the course. Malloy turned a par score
for the first seven holes of his match. The
Country Club team as a whole were playing
a much more inferior game than was their
custom, as can be seen by their former
scores. Cannon in particular was exceed-
ingly unlucky, turning in a fifty which was
his worst score of the season. Following are
the results of the match:

Milhous. and Reeves, of Davidson, beat
Furr and Sherrill, of Concord, one up on the
first round and two up on the second. Score,
$ points.

Malloy and Grey, of Davidson, beat Bell
and Irving, of Concord, seven up on the
