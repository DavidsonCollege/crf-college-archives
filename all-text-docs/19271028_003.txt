Wildcats uncasing a surprise air attack,

The program for the day started at
10:45 a. m, with a dress parade by the R.
O. T. C. battalion; immediately following
this, the formal presentation of the Rich-
ardson stadium: and athletic field was
made. The presentation program was
opened by music by the R. O. T. C. band.
The invocation led Rev, J. GC
Rowan, D.D., President of the Alumni
Association, ollowing the invocation
was the introduction of Mr. J. Max Hen-
drix, '14,.0f Greensboro, who represent-
ed Messrs. H, S, and L. Richardson,
donors of the field and stadium, who were

Chameleon to Increase
Number of Publications
During Present Session

Material Should be Submitted to
Department Heads

FOUR ISSUES
First Issue Before Christmas Will be
Published the Middle of

November

Readers of the Chameleon will be glad
to know that there will be four editions
of the magazine this year instead of the
three.as has been the regular number of
issues ‘in the past.

The first issue wil
appear during the. middle of November,
and this will be the only one befar: the
the Chrstmas holidays. Old students will
remember that the time of publication of
the Chameleon is not exactly in accord-
ance with that of the past years, How-
ever the staff this year feels that the
spring is a more fitting time for the puh-
lication ofthe magazine than is the fall,
due in part to the fact that the students
are more occupied with college activities
than in the spring. It has also been feit
that the present system will more eveniy
divide the college year than has the for-
mer plan.

As usual there will be the four prin-
cipal constituents, namely, Poetry, Fic-
tion, Essays, and Book Reviews, New
plans and improvements are now being
worked on, and will soon be made public.

The Chameleon, as the college magazine
has been called for the past three years,
will be, it is felt sure, as good this year
as it has been in the, past. The present
staff with J. G, Wisston as the editor-in-

chief, and Val Guthery as the business |:

manager, has had a great deal of expe-
rience and has shown no mean talent in
the past.

Anyone wishing to submit anything for
publication in the magazine this year
should turn his material in to Brdwn Mc-
Queen, who is editor of the Short ‘Story
Department, Bayce Martin, the editor of
the Poetry department, Caldwell Withers,
the editor of the Book Review depart-
