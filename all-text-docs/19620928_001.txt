Council Requests Decision
On Holiday Cut Regulations

BY CHARLES RAMBERG
Davidsonian Assignments Editor

The Student Council has requested the Faculty
Executive Committee to clarify its position on the holiday |
clause of the absence regulations now in effect.

In a letter to President D.
Grier Martin, chairman of the
committee, Student Body Presi-
dent Danny Carrell emphasized
the council’s concern over the
as-yet undefined penalty for
cuts taken two days before or
after holiday periods.

Immediately after the new
cut system was approved by the
faculty last spring, the council
requested that the holiday
clause, Section 11-E of the reg-
ulations, be deleted. The request
failed to receive favorable action
by the faculty committee.

Carrell’s letter, unanimous-

ly approved in the Student |

Council meeting Monday eve-
ning, suggests possible alter-
natives to the present void.
The letter states, “The Council
feels that it is only fair that the

student body be informed of the |
Further- |

Committee's feelings.
more, the Council suggests that
the use of a double or perhaps a
triple cut penalty be consider-
ed.”

After the Monday meeting,
Carrell told THE DAVIDSON-
IAN that the council plans to
study during the year the
problems of off-campus drink-
ing and the statement all fra-
ternity presidents are requir-
ed to sign after each dance
weekend with regard to drink-
ing violations they have wit-
nessed.

rt Keeping
Violations

An unusually high number of students have been

hauled into Traffic Court so

According to Assistant Dean
of Students, D. G. Martin, the
number has been averaging 75
per week. In a normal week
only about 25 violations are re-
ported. Martin noted that the
cause seems to be the confusion
due to the first weeks of school
and the general ignorance of the
traffic regulations.

The system of handling traf-
fic violations remains basically
the same as it was last year.
The vehicle is registered
through the purchase of a per-
mit. This year the window stick-
ers used in the past for identi-
fication have been replaced by
bumper stickers for the con-
venience of Mr. Linker, the

security officer.

Fines are paid at the bur-
sar’s office. An additional fee
of one dollar is charged to
students who must be “track-
ed down” by their license
numbers.

The Traffic Court presently

consists of a representative of
the treasurer, the bursar, and
the dean of students. A repre-

sentative of the Student Council, ,

John Soratt, also is on the court.

The traffic violator must ap-
pear before the court, which
meets every Friday afternoon.

Davidson. College owns this
tract of land and some of the
woods that stand fast by it And
soon the face of the earth will
show no more, soon there will
be no gully and no fields—only
water. Lake Normah, which has
already crept into the gully, will
continue to rise until it has
completely conquered the spot.

The surrounding woods will
also undergo change, change
that is even now being planned
by an expert landscape architect.
Beginning next summer, the
alteration will affect every
watery-brained Davidson stud-
ent and faculty member. Where
once a man could tread, he will
be able to swim in a spot laid
out especially for that purpose.

even more change will ‘take
place.

Grover C. Meetze, director
of the physical plant, plans to
put pit rock on the roadbed
soon and in January sink
pilings off the marina and
swimming area.

The college also hopes that
toilet facilities and bath houses
can be installed before the sum-
mer. “In fact,” business man-
ager Robert Currie stated, “we

hope to have all essential ele-

ments necessary to the use of

the lake completed by the time
it has finished filling.”

“The unfortunate thing at
this time,” said Currie, “is
that we don‘t know exactly
how much land Duke Power
will give us behind our shore-
line.” He said that the college
has hired Charles F. Gillette
of Richmond, Va., to do the
planning of the landscaping
once the boundary of the land
is known.

Currie added that it will take
some time to develop the whole
area “as we would like it to
look finally.” Money, of course,
is the chief factor. Besides the
priority objects mentioned, the
college plans to have hiking
trails and picnic areas.

Other considerations are be-

ing made for a games area

that could include tennis and Davidson’s watery playground within a year.
