MAKING GOOD.

—--

Some years ago, at a Northern uni-
versity, it was discovered that a man
who was considered a member of the
Senior class had done no work there
himself, but was, receiving credit for

by defraying the other man’s expenses.
This emphasized the fact. that the great
difficulty today is not in obtaining an
opportunity to get an education but in
getting the education itself. The pa-
rents plus the college furnishes the op-
portunity to the student to receive an
education. No one but the student can
use the opportunity, and the opportunity
is worthless unless it is used. Are you
making good use of your opportunity ?
The facts in the case show that “rf
per cent of all mid-term grades were
unsatisfactory, and it is pathetic to set
students allowing their opportunities ir
life to do something to glide from their
rasp. Here is a man who says that he
is going to be a doctor. When his re-
port comes in he is down on this subjec’
and down on that. It is an easy matter
to see that he will never be a doctor al-
tho he may be a M. D.—Maule Driver
Here is another man who is planning
to be a, lawyer, but the omens indicate
that he will work at a ground-saw-mill.
Here is a prospective teacher, but the
oracle is saying that he will never pre-
nare: his students for complete living.
but they are going to take each other’s
opinions hefore they will take his. Here
is a man who expects to preach, but it
would not take a prophet to predict that
the sheep will look up and not he fed.
These are not typical types of the whole
student body, but the minority who pre-
fer to drift just anvwhere rather than
row into the harhor of success. These
are the men who are not making good.
There is some excuse to be offered for
these men, because, as stated pefore, it is
not an easy thing to make good. Grind-
ing out the same schedule ench dav, and
taking in dry subject matter are fre-

quently. unattractive; but the difference | .

in making good and not making gond is
so great that every sun which comes
round ought to find you bucking the line
no less easily than right well —Fx.

A well-known judge went into a
butcher shop one morning. After a brief

give me a little legal advice? Suppose
a dog should come into your shop and

“Sue the dog’s owner,” said the judge.
“Was it a valuable piece of meat?”

“It was a fine roast, worth five dol-
lars.”

“Well,” said the judge, “I should sue
the owner, then, for five dollars.”

“Good!” said the butcher, with a
grin; “it was vour dog, judge.”

The judge smilingly paid the butcher
and left. .

Soon afterward the butcher met the
judge. “Judge,” he said, “T have here
a bill from vou for five dollars. What
is that for?” '

The judge smiled again. “That,” he
said, “is for the legal advice I gave you
