TWO-GOCD
DEBATES SECURED.

‘Two debating contracts — tor
Spring have been recently signed,
preparations will begin immediately att
er Christmas for the preliminaries to de
termine the members of the two teams
which will represent Davidson.

Both of the debates, the one with
Clemson College, and the one with
Emory College. in Georgia, will be held
on Easter Monday night. ‘Vhe Emory-
Davidson debate will be staged at Agnes
Scort College. in Decatur, Ga.
debate with Clemson, at Winthrop, it is
hoped.

Intercollegiate debating is fast assuny
ing great prominence in the American
colleges, and there has been much inter
est in the contests which Davidsen has
engayved in. Davidson has been excep
tionally successful in this Tine. Year
before last she won bot debates, with
Wake Forest and the University — of
South Carolina, by unanimous decisions.
Last vear the Davidson team. lost — to
South Carolina. but won the series cup
from Wake Forest.

Great interest is already being shown!
in the coming debates, and it is to be
hoped that a large number of men from
both societies will enter the prelimi
naries. Davidson has alreadsy proposed
subjects to both Clemson and Emory
and answers as to the sides chosen are ¢x-
pected within a week. The subjects
will be posted in the reference room of
the library. where material for study of
them will also be collected.

The debate with Emory is a single de-
bate, the one with Clemson the first of
a series of three.

“Tennessee is putting up a strong claim
this. vear for. the foot ball championship
of the South. Neither Auburn nor Ten-
nessee has been defeated this season, but
Auburn was recently held to a scoreless
tie by Georgia, while Tennessee has won
every game she has played this season.
Auburn, however, claims that it con le.
belongs to her as her goal line has not
been crossed during the entire season.
There has been some talk of arranging a
game between Tennessee and Auburn,
but nothing has been done as yet.
