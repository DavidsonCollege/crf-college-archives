Jonathan Sings [ronic Lyrics

By STEPHEN MANK

Irony is one of the long lost devices
of rock and roll. In the sixties Country
Joe McDonald could safely sing,
“Whoopee, we're all gonna die” in his
Vietnam rag without fear of being mis-
understood.

Jonathan Richman and the Modern
Lovers are even more ironic than
Country Joe and the Fish. Instead of
making light of serious things,
Richman transforms routine activities
into major social issues. His well-
crafted lyrics are at first childlike and
winsome, but after a few listenings
they become bizarre, leading one to
believe Mr. Richman is a. little
touched.

The album, Jonathan Sings would
seem to be a concept album based on
trying to turn the listener on to any-
thing from Paris to walking to conga
drums.

Known perhaps best for his song
off a former LP, “Ice Cream Man,”
Richman has a wonderful capacity for
self parody. His song “This Kind of
Music” is actually an almost derogat-
ory description of the style in which
the song is played. “The saxophone
sounds like the cat dragged it in/ But I
want it in my life / ‘Cause this kind of

music is the kind I like.”
His strange lyrics are both lulling

and disturbing. “Stop This Car” sings
of being trapped in a renegade auto-
mobile. Pleads Richman, “I’m not
gonna wait till we drop in a brook /
When the little fishies stop and take a
look.”

Probably the most enchanting song
on the album is “Not Yet Three,” the
lament of a two year old who has the
whole world figured out.

One of the few faults of the album
is that Richman really cannot sing,
despite the LP’s name. His flat voice
does sometimes let you know that he is
singing a gentle parody when nothing

else will. The Modern Lovers are ex-
cellent musicians; the two female voc-
alists sing in cherubic lilting voices
that add a pleasant complement to
Richman.

The music tends towards boogie-
woogie and slow easy listening with a
tinge of a four-four bombastic drum-
beat. Some songs, such as “Conga
Drums” are imitations of certain
styles, in this case surf music.

Jonathan’ Sings is not the kind of
album you will like on the first listen,
but soon you will find yourself dancing
for no apparent reason to “Well, boom
boom boom / and thrum thrum/I kinda
like those conga drums.”

Quick pan: After hearing Pat Be-
natar’s new, creatively titled LP, Be-

natar, | have decided that there can

only be two reasons why people buy |

her albums: (1) pity that this is the only
thing she can do; or (2) fear that any-
thing else she can do is dangerous to
life and limb. Benatar may by bought
at a record store near you for a mere
$8.99, so please support this poor girl.
One additional note: representatives
from the Civil Defense Administration
will be happy to disengage any Pat Be-
natar album and destroy it immediately
thereafter if you will call them.

Road Warrior Continues

Mad Max's Trip

By MATT MORRIS

The Road Warrior (1982; Australian)
Produced by Byron Kennedy. Directed
by George Miller. Written by James
McCausland and George Miller. Starring
the fine Mel Gibson. RATING: ****
Viewer’s Guide: Raiders of the Lost Ark
about 30 times faster and with a parade of
graphic violence

Ever heard of Mad Max? A police-
man by profession, turned “road war-
rior” after a nuclear holocaust, this Geo-
rge Miller creation may be the biggest
reason that you're listening to Men at
Work, analyzing Peter Weir's hypnotic
films, and of course, enjoying the talents
of one of the few 80's actors with a
superstar quality, Mel Gibson.

Set in the ominously near future, The
Road Warrior, a sequel to Mad Max,
continues the film’s fuel-injected high
speed derring-do with an even greater in-
density. Thematically the “Max” films
add up to zilch, yet technically they are
- marvels, of the hand-held camera.and are
“unpretentious enough’ to generate a
charm (among all the car stunts): that
even the biggest film cynic could not
deny. After all, what other movie do you
know of thathas a villain (and a dastardly
villain he is) named Humungus? Or how
about a gun-slinging dog? Or how about
an almost 45-minute chase sequence in-
volving a gas truck, a gyrocoptor, about
20 motorcycles, and the nine-year-old
feral kid? Eventually, The Road Warrior

takes on a world-of-its-own look that
many fantasy films strive for but few
achieve. Throughout it remains as unpre-
dictable as it is. exhilarating? Just when
you think Miller has slipped into a com-
fortably clichéd situation, he kills off a
character, throws in a plot twist, or
sometimes just does nothing. In fact,
Miller does so many things right with
The Road Warrior that you would be
making a mistake missing it. Step into
your nitrogen-powered V-8 engine car
and cruise over to Love. It’ $ a trip worth
making.
