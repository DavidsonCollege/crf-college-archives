NEW OFFICERS ARE '
ELECTED BY GOLF CLUB

A meeting of the Davidson Golf Club
was held February 16, at which the fol-
lowing officers were elected: Dr. H.
B. Arbuckle, president ; Dr. G. H. Cart-
ledge, treasurer; J. W. Clark, secretary ;
A. E. Wood, chairman of greens com-
mittee. A resolution was passed that
caddies should not receive more than 15
cents for nine holes; this includes car-
rying clubs. Another resolution was
passed that none should pay over 10
cents for any ball which has been found.
As has been brought out before, the Golf
Club is not a college but a town organi-
zation, the privileges of which are ex-
tended to the students if they desire to
become members.
