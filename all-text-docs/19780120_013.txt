Htead basketball coach Dave
Pritchett. requested and was
yranted a medical leave of
absence Friday, January 13,
and Davidson is now seeking
its fourth coach in two years.

Immediate prospects for the
hiring of a new coach are not
bright, for those few who are -
available fer the job in mid-
January are generally those
who have recently been fired
‘ from a similar position.

Athletie Director ‘Fhomas
Cartmill is not without ¢andi-
dates, but there is no man
particularly outstanding at
this point, and certainly Cart-
mill's percentages are more
favorable in waiting until after
the season to get a qualified
coach.

“Hf we can locate the right
person immediately.”’ he com-
mented, “we might make the

going to panic.”

The reason for Cartmill's
relative calm lies in the person

who has been’an assistant for
the past two years and is
presently serving as interim
head coach.

retention as head coach is a
definite possibility.

Pritchett's illness remains
something of an enigma. De-
scribed as suffering ‘mental
and physical exhaustion,"’ he
is presently under the care of a
neurologist and a psychiatrist.

In the recurrent examina-
tion and. treatment he has
undergone since June. no tan-
gible physical infirmity has

The mysterious character of
the ailment ‘as well as Pritch-
ett's celebrated ‘‘disappear-
ance’ from Chapel Hill's N.C.
Memorial Hospital on January
3 has prompted a substantial
amount of journalistic com-
mentary.

The Observer, in a some-
what farcieal tone, remarked
that “the school: seemed un-
sure how to handle the situa-
tion and how-to make the fact
public.” — sae

that ‘we have been on top of

Young wrestlers fall prey
to early Seasoninexperience

By J.A.H.
Staff Writer

Since | experienced in high
school, almost all the varsity
sports participated in at Da-
vidson, I feel I can say that
wrestling is one of the most
physically demanding and in-
dividualistic sports.

A match contains three
periods totalling eight minutes
of wrestling. When a wrestler
enters a match, there is: little
help to be had from either the
coach or teammates other than
screams of encouragement or
instructions.

Charley Parker and his
wrestlers hosted Elon College
and The Citadel on January
14. The first contest of the
afternoon was Davidson vs.
The Citadel.

Although there was little to
cheer about concerning the
score, The Citadel 47-David-
son 4, there were several]
exciting matches.

Pat McKinsey wrestling in
the 134 Ibs. class was pinned
in the second period. Yet,
McKinsey is only a freshman,
and with a good portion of the
season remaining as well as
three more years at Davijson,
he should develop into a fine
wrestler.

Team captain Glenn Ballard
was leading 2-0 after the first
period, but lost 13-10 on
points in a match in which the
lead changed several times.

Scott Phillips in the 177 Ibs.
class provided the most exci-
ting match of the first contest
as well as Davidson's onlv
Victory. Phillips led 11-4 after
the first two periods which

were filled with fast paced
reversals and near-pins (most-
lv by Phillips).

Action slowed in the third
period, and Phillips held on
to win 13-6 on points.

In the second contest of the
afternoon, The Citadel defea-
ted Elon College by a score of
45-9. Elon College then com-
peted with Davidson in the
third and final contest of the
afternoon.

Richard Reich in the 126
lbs. class started Davidson off
with an 8-3 victory. Pat
McKinsey at 134 Ibs. and
Glenn Ballard at 142 lbs. won
by forfeit.

Pat Dulaney, a loser in his
first match, represented Da-
vidson in the 150 Ibs. class.
Dulaney opened aggressively
and dominated his man both
technically and physically.
Leading 16-4 in the secona
period, he went on to win 24-7.

Scott Phillips, unable to
match his earlier performance,
lost on points.

Heavyweight class wrestler
Rob King found his second
opponent more to his liking;
he lost his first match against
The Citadel by a fall (pin).
King won his second match by
a fall in the third period.

Unfortunately these victo-
ries were unable to overcome
the higher scoring Elon wrest-
lers. The contest ended Elon
27-Davidson 26.

After the match,
Ballard was able to offer these
comments on une veam: ““Uur
biggest problem is lack of
experience and maturity.”

Ballard feels it is a matter of
time before the team will
mature mentally. Perhaps this
will happen this weekend when
the team journeys to The
Citadel to compete in their
annual tournament.

Glenn

the manifold medical and legal
ramifications necessitated
caution in dealing with the
affair.

There was some hope that a
prolonged rest over the Christ-
mas holidays would enable
Pritchett to resume his duties,
but the illness is of an
indefinite length.

Accordingly, when Pritch-
ett submitted his request for
medical leave of absence, the
college decided it. was best for
all concerned to grant it and to
begin the search for a replace-
ment as quickly as possible.
Pritchett has been offered a_
position other than head coach
with the college upon his full
recovery.

Concern has arisen over the
possible departure of some of
this vear’s freshmen and par-
ticularly that of guard Chris
Dodds. Pritchett was a factor
of significance importance in
Dodd's decision to attend Da-
vidson, and to him “the loss
was a real blow.”’

He describes his former
coach as sincere, extremely
dedicated, and a gifted moti-
vator. ‘I trust him more than
anyone I've ever met,”’. Dodds
remarked.

Nevertheless, Dodds em-
phasizes that he has no plans
to leave now) and would not
relish the compulsory one-
year ineligibility which would
ensue should he transfer.

The entire situation is cer-
tainly unfortunate, and one
must empathize with the play-
ers, who are the central figures
in this disconcerting whirl of
transient leadership. They are
to be admired for their perser-
verance.

The college has received a
blow to its professed aspira-
tion to become a national
basketball power, but Cartmill
retains confidence in the ul-
timate realization of this goal,
and promises that ‘‘we're
yoing ahead with it,’’ for there
remain a great many interes-
ted people behind him.
