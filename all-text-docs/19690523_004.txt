Stevens Optimistic
About Next Year

For the past two years, the
baseball team has been
simply described as ‘fielding
and Slade, but the pitching
is frayed.”

This year, however. the
Davidson batsmen added a
pitching staff to Gordon
Slade's hitting and the Wild-
cat fielding, and recorded
one of the most successful

baseball records in recent
years. .
Three freshmen hurlers,

Mike Frye. Rick Pipan and
Marshal! Case, joined the
Wildcats this year and won
seven of Davidson's eight
victories. Pipan also led the
team in strikeouts. fanning
59 while walking only eight.

Slade was his usual swing-
ing self, finishing fourth in

By A. W. TURNER JR.
Asst.. Sports Editor

The recruiting program of
basketball coaches Larry
Brown and Bo Brickles con-
tinues to progress, as another
new addition to the David-
son hardwood, John Pecorak,
signed a cage scholarship
yesterday.

Pecorak, a 66" post man
from Fairfax. Virginia. last
year led his Woodson High
School team to a 19-2 record.
He was the leading rebound-
er on the team, averaging
13 stray shots a game. and
was the second leading
scorer behind his younger
brother. with a 17-point aver-

age.

‘We are really excited
about getting Pecorak.”
Brown said. ‘‘We feel we are

very fortunate to get him.
He is an aggressive ball
player and a team leader.”

coaching staff.

“It should be a_ very
good game,” Smith said
after Wednesday's practice,
in which the two teams prac-
ticed against each other.
“It's the old story of num-
ber two trying to beat num-
ber one.’

The contest, which begins
at 2. will be a full game,
complete with officials,
clock and kick-offs.

"We'll have the wraps on
the game for obvious rea-
sons,” Smith said. “We won't
show all that. we can do
so that we’ll have some sur-
prises left for next year.

“I expect to see a lot of
running, since we have been
working hard on our ground
game this year. Also, there.
may be a few other new
twists."

One of the many interest:-
ing aspects of the game will
be the appearance of ex-
basketballer Ricky Snipes as
a starting defensive lineman.
Smith has been pleased with
Snipes’ development so far
this spring.

The ‘whites’ will be quart-
erbacked in the -first half
by Mark Thompson, while
all-conference Gordon Slade
will lead the ‘‘reds.”’ Many
of the starters from last sea-
son‘s varsity line wil! anchor
the forward wall for the
“reds,” while the ‘‘whites’
will have almost an entirely
freshman line.

“It may be a little one-
sided, but it will give the
team a good chance to plav
under game _ conditions,”
Smith said. ‘Besides, num-
ber two tries harder, and
that could make the game
very interesting.”

pitcher for the Wildcat base-
ball squad, went to Jeffer-
son High Schoo! in Alexan-
dria, Va., and played against
Pecorak.

“He's a husky guy,”’ Case
commented, ‘and is real
strong inside. Pecorak is a lot
like Doug Cook, very ag-
gressive and a good rebound
er. He charges the boards
real well. Despite being an
aggressive player, he seems
to avoid foul trouble.”

Pecorak was sought by
schools all over the country,
but narrowed his choice
down to Tennessee. Columbia.
Rutgers and Davidson.

Pecorak's younger brother
is considered to be one. of
the top future prospects after
finishing as one of the top-
ranked players in Virginia
this year.

“Im satisfied with this

Stevens said. ‘‘We've done a
good job. and I’m proud of
eur eight wins."

Stevens singled out Mur-
phy and Stew Brown for be:
ing “real leaders for the
team this year. They were
able to give a lot of the
freshmen help and to spark
enthusiasm in the team.”

Stevens was also pleased
with the play of Bruce Weid-
ner. a senior playing his first
year of baseball for David-
son. ‘Bruce did a fine job,
considering that this was
the first time that he'd play-
ed college ball. He was one
of our leading hitters and
fielders." Weidner finished
behind Slade among the reg-
ulars, hitting .268.

Stevens is very optimistic
about next year. particularly
because of the returning
freshmen. Besides the three
pitchers. outfielders H 1!
Mapes. John Calhoun and
Gene Williams. infielder Jack
Latimer and catcher Har-
old Wilkerson will be back
-after their first season.

“Wilkerson did a good job
behind the plate as our start.
ing catcher this year. parti-
cularly in handling the
young pitching staff, and
Latimer should be a_ sure
starter next season some.
where in the infield after
playing well this year,”
Stevens said. :
Also, several new faces
will be among the base.
ballers next year, faces that
Stevens feels will bolster the
Wildcat baseball program.

Davis Beaston. a pitching
star from High Point, leads
the list of incoming base-
baliers. Beaston was an all-
state pick last year and
could add much-needed depth
to the Wildcat: staff.

Four other prep mound
standouts will also join the
Wildeat team. Andy Davis,
who is coming to Davidson
on a football scholarship
from Pennsylvania, Felix
Mitchel! from Jacksonville.
Fla., Fred Ourt of Wilming-
ton. and New Jersey's Bruce
Batten all promise to lend
support to the Wildcats.

All in all, it looks like im-
provement in Davidson base-
ball is not just a one year
thing. As Stevens said. “T
think that we're on the rise.”
