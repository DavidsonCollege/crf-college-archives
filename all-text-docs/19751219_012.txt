Cats embarrassed in Atlanta

By PAUL BANTA
Staff Writer

Sliding quickly into medio-
crity, the Davidson Wildcats
were defeated Tuesday night
by the Yellow Jackets of
Georgia Tech, 85-60.

The Wildcats appeared to be
uninspired from the very start
as they allowed the slow, but
steady, Yellow Jackets to
jump to an early 10-4 lead in
the first five minutes of play.
The two teams just traded

and from John Gerdy’s lay-up

a single point. Georgia Tech

The second half brought no

percent in the first half, did

on only 14 of 32 shots, and
although they managed to

to ten points at the 12:59

senior guard Mike Bottorff,

Swimmers triumph

Remain unbeaten

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
: Staff Writer

Davidson’s swimming team
remained unbeaten with a
close 50-45 victory over UNC-
Asheville last Thursday.

After losing the initial
event, Davidson trailed UNC-
A throughout the meet and
was behind 43-45 going into
the final event.

At that point Jim Wood,
Tim Bode, John Frederick and
Jonathan Washburn combined
for an 18 second victory in the
400 yard relay giving the meet
to Davidson.

Despite the loss UNC-A
picked up seven first place
finishes in the eleven events;
Davidson, though, kept pace
by consistently placing in each
event.

“It was a funny meet be-
cause we won on the strength
of second and third place
finishes,’’ commented Coach
Pat Drake.

Once again Washburn led
the team with two individual
victories; he also swam the
anchor leg of the final relay.

In the 200 yard individual
medley Washburn set a new
school record going the dis-

tance in 2:11.7. John Frede-
rick picked up the only other
individual Davidson victory as
he captured the 100 yard
freestyle event while Bode and
Wood contributed two second
place finishes apiece.

Strategy played an impor-
tant part in the competition as
UNC-A agreed to compete
against Davidson strictly on
the swimming level and not
accept the 16 points that
Davidson must forfeit for not
having any team members. in
the diving competition. Those
16 points would have negated
Davidson’s final winning mar-
gin of five points and given the
victory to UNC-A.

In addition, UNC-A com-
mitted their best swimmers
early in the competition while
Coach Pat Drake saved her
strongest swimmers for the
final relay (which proved to be
the winning margin).

“TI knew it would be close
and I felt it depended on where
she (the UNC-A_ coach)
entered her swimmers,’’ Drake
explained. ‘“‘By throwing all
their good swimmers in the
first relay they didn’t have
any strong swimmers left for
the last event.”

Jimmy the Freak

Freak rates
bowl games

Yes, the famous or infamous
as this year’s’ patrons know
) Jimmy the Freek has been
red out of retirement.
Because of my immense
ccess in predicting last
ear’s bowl games, this year’s
es will be dealt with equal
prognosticating ability.
« My credentials should be
well known school-wide in
making spreads on college and
pro football games a la Jimmy
the Greek.

There is at least one impor-
tant difference, however, be-
tween these two ‘‘celebrities’’.
Where the Greek totally ab-
stains from gambling, this
seer tries to exploit his exper-
tise to steal ‘‘nickels and
dimes” away from all students
bar none.

Tangerine Bowl, December
20, Miami [Ohio]. and South
Carolina. This is Mi-
ami’s permanent bowl game.
They own an invitation to it
like that other Ohio team does
to the Rose Bowl.

Jim Carlen has done a
superb job with the Game-
cocks and he could get them
really psyched for Grantz’ last
game. I’ll have to rate this one
even.

Liberty Bowl, December 22,
Texas A&M and Southern
Cal. This minor(?) game could
be the second best bowl game
next to the Orange.

It’s a classic match-up of
Ricky Bell against A&M’s
defense, which’ suddenly be-
came porous against Arkan-
sas. Even though it’s Mc-
Kay’s last USC game, A&M
has to prove they deserve top
five mention. A&M by 6.

Fiesta Bowl, December 26,
Arizona State and Nebraska.
In mid-season it looked as
though the Cornhuskers might
find the #1 rating by season’s
end. After a defeat by a great
Oklahoma team, they were
shoved into this relatively
minor game by Bear Bryant.

When one is asked to name
two unbeaten teams this year,
one immediately thinks of
Ohio State then will stutter
before throwing out something
like San Diego state.

Believe it or not, Arizona
State has not lost. It won’t
matter though in this high-
‘scoring contest as Nebraska
will show Bear where to Zo.

If one has a chance to watch
any bowl game besides the

major four, watch this one--
‘there'll be lots of action. Final

will be something like Nebras-
ka 41, Arizona State 35.
Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl,De-
cember 27, Texas and Colora-
do. This is one of the four
bowl games in which both
teams are rated in the top 10.
