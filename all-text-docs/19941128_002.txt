SGA articulates debate about Presbyterian
requirement for college president in letter to trustees

By Sarah Teachworth

The Davidson campus has re-
cently been abuzz with the contro-
versy over whether the college’s
By-Laws should continue to require
the president of the college to be an
active Presbyterian. An important
step in the resolution of the dispute
was taken at the November 15 SGA
meeting when the senators voted to
submit a letter to the trustees pre-
senting both sides of the issue.

The origin of the argument

The matter was first brought
up by SGA President Eric
Rosenbach six weeks ago. His

main concern with the current by-
law was that the requirement criti-
cally limited the pool of presiden-
tial applicants. Freshman Senator
Lucian Dervan says, “There are
very few African-Americans who
are Presbyterian, and the current
rule almost assures that there will

‘never be a president of Davidson

College from a minority group.
The current debate
The interim SGA meetings
have found division among the
senators and a large amount of

indecisiveness. Opponents of the

change point out that if a resolu-

tion was passed, some alumni may
become angry with the school.
According to the SGA Min-
utes from November 1, Senator
Rick Onkey found that “eight out
of the top 10 donors to Davidson
were Presbyterian” and that “ap-
proximately $20,000 per year is
received directly from the Church.”
Because of this financial tie, some
senators feel that the school owes
it to the Presbyterian Church to
remain affiliated in more than just
a traditional sense.
The SGA acts, sending letter to
trustees

* However, the importance of
the Presbyterian tradition at
Davidson brought the greatest
amount of division among the
SGA. Because of their lack of
cohesion, the SGA decided at their
November 8 meeting that in the
place and stead of a resolution, a
letter explaining the controversy
to the trustees would be drawn up
and voted on at the following meet-
ing.

Rosenbach says, “A letter ef-
fectively articulates the concerns
of the students. The Senate should
not feel it has to pass a resolution to

make a statement. The letter will
be a more valuable tool for the
trustees when they discuss the is-
sue in the spring.”

Dervan comments, “The let-
ter which passed the SGA and will
be sent fo the trustees is the most
viable solution, giving both sides
of the issue the chance to lobby the
final decision makers.”

Last Tuesday, the first draft of
the letter was circulated among
those present at the SGA meeting.

Martin Court F after negotiations end.

Where are sports courts?
RLO, physical plant, A.D. and others negotiating

By Mary Laura Moretz

Senior Class President B. J.
Rudell says, “It looks like we have
most of what we need” to finance
the building of new basketball and
volleyball courts behind Martin
Court Building F.

Director of Residence Life
Richard Terry says RLO is pre-
pared to commit about $4,000 of
the estimated $6,000 cost of build-
ing the courts.

’ Terry adds, “Of course,
should we discover it creates noise
problems for the nearby residents,
we would propose to do some land-
scaping or a wall of some kind.”
Additions would raise the price of
the new courts significantly.

Executive Assistant to the
President and Director of Institu-
tional Research Dr. John Kelton
says, “I think we can definitely say
‘when’ and not ‘if’ they will be

built now. We’re looking for the
funds and making some progress.”

Rudell is still pushing to get
the project moving before the win-
ter break. “The charity drive is just
such a good incentive to get it done
before exams.”

Progress, however, must wait
on further consultation among
Kelton, Residence Life Office,
physical plant, and the athletic de-
partment.

African-Americans dissatisfied?

According to SERCH (Stu-
dents for the Establishment of Ra-
ial and Cultural Harmony) Presi-
dent Jo Burrows, her organization
attempts to educate people to dif-
ferences in culture. “We want to
help students understand that Afri-
can-Americans are not and should
not be like everyone else. They
don’t have to ‘act white’ to be
accepted,” said Burrows.

COMA:

The Council for Minority Af-
fairs (COMA) “encourages stu-
dents to take initiative in policy,”
says student’ Co-Chair Tasha
Jenkins. She advocates changes in
the faculty, either for more Afri-

can-American professors or for
professors “sensitive to diversity.”
A Call for Change

Despite a growing awareness
of minority issues, most African-
Americans at Davidson feel that
the changes are only on the sur-
face. The social scene often leads
some students to transfer. Senior
Nikki Liverman argues, “Davidson
social life is hard, but for African-
Americans, itis even harder.” Still,
she believes that she has found her
niche and feels satisfied with
Davidson.

Students feel that change lies
in the power of the trustees and the
faculty. One senior says, “Until
the faculty includes more African-
American professors, and people
see blacks in the classroom more

than in the Commons, African-
Americans will feel isolated here.”

Another senior agrees that
“nothing has changed. Two years
ago, people organized a black fra-
ternity, and Anthony Foxx (1991-
92 SGA President) called for
changes, but everything stays the
same.”

Whenasked about the changes
in students, that senior says, “On
paper, they have changed. Other-
wise, everything is the same.”

The current curriculum needs
revision, say some. Junior Debbie
Liverman says, “They don’t have
any courses on African-Americans
other than history or English. We
need all professors to include mi-
nority concerns in the scopes of
their courses.”

Ecumenical Council
Starts petition to

reaf:

‘irm presidential ties

to Presbyterian Church

By Mary Clare Jalonick

People all over campus are
currently debating whether the
president of the college should be
required to be Prebyterian, and the
Ecumenical Council wants the
trustees to know how they feel.

Students signed a petition writ-
ten by the Council last Wednesday
and Thursday in Chambers. The
petition stated the position of the
Council concerning the question
of the President’s religion.

Lilian Montgomery, President
of the Ecumenical Council, says
“It is important for the president as
a figurehead of the college to reaf-

firm Davidson’s tiestothe Presby- .
- terian Church.”

The petition states, “Recog-
nizing the important role of the
Presbyterian Church (USA) in the
life of Davidson College, we the
undersigned affirm the school’s
relationship with the Presbyterian

Church and support these signifi-
cant ties in the future, including
that the requirement that the presi-
dent be an active member of the
Presbyterian Church.” :

“There seems to be a general
trend that SGA is trying to cut the
ties, and this is a reaction to that,”
says Samantha Hackett, a member
of the Council,

Matt Rich, a sophomore on
the Council, says that the Council
feels that “the church has shaped
the identity of Davidson. The lead-
ers of the college, specifically the

_ president, should remain Presby-

terian to hold that identity.”

The Council will present the
petition to President Kuykendall,
and they hope that he will show it
to the Board of Trustees on their
next retreat. The SGA plans to
presenta separate letter to the trust-
ees which presents both sides of
the issue. 3
