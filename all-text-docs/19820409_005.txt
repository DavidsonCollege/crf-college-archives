N.Y. Times Removes Its Name From Best-Selling Guide to Colleges

Under criticism for irreverently grad-
ing 265 campuses,The New York Times
has withdrawn its name from future edi-
tions of what was The New York Times
Selective Guide to Colleges and Univer-
sities, and has offered to meet with ag-
grieved administrators to correct factual
errors in the book.

The Times, however, is not the only
would-be guide to colleges to take its
lumps recently for poking fun at bad ca-
feteria food, dull communities and rah-
rah campuses. Even Yale’s irreverent
Insider’ s Guide to Colleges, a ten-year-
old veteran of the wisecrack rating ge-
nre, is thinking about getting a little
more serious. |

The reason, says one editor, is that
the jokes’ targets are too worried about
survival to do much laughing.

“I think universities are more sensi-
tive to criticism, especially with the en-

rollment picture the way it is now,” says
Charles. Straughn, editor of Lovejoy’s
Guide to Colleges and Universities, a
traditionally objective, comprehensive
study of 3500 colleges published annu-
ally since, 1945.

Lovejoy’ s has “looked at the others,
and it’s a tough act to follow. You leave
yourself wide open for all kinds of criti-
cism whatever you do (with a lighter
look). I think we’ ll stick to our objective
approach.”

The Times did apparently leave it-

‘self wide open for criticisms from ad-

ministrators who' complained the book

- was little more than a “restaurant guide

approach” riddled with factual errors
and unfair, superficial judgments.
What hurts most, many say, is that
even though the tone is consciously ir-
reverent, The Times’ lofty status gives
the book a certain aura of objectivity.

“You just expect more from The
New York Times,” says Koy Floyd, uni-
versity relations director at the Univer-
sity of Tulsa.

“It’s a very serious matter for us.
Here they are trying to rate an entire aca-
demic program, and they use a sarcas-
tic, flippant attitude.”

Among the other schools to object to
their evaluations in the book were Ken-
tucky, Colby College, Rhode Island,
Dartmouth, Baylor, Syracuse, Bard

College, Carnegie-Mellon, Rochester’

and Auburn.

“If you notice, most of the criticism
has come from second- and third-ranked
private colleges,” Times Education Edi-
tor Edward B. Fiske says. “All of the
objective criticism—in the Christian
Science Monitor and the Wall Street
Journal—has been positive. Most of the
critical mail has come from schools in

very competitive markets.”

Fiske concedes “in a project as com-
plex as this there will be some factual er-
rors,” and is ready to correct them. He
defends the book’s light tone by saying,
“We tried to say, ‘What questions
would a student ask when he is looking
at universities?’ and answer them. The
bulk of the book is what students said
about their campuses.”

He says The Times is withdrawing
its name from the book—which was and
will continue to be published by Times
Books—because “the book wasn’t writ-
ten like a newspaper. Some people
might say the food at Dartmouth is terri-
ble. Some might say it’s good. It’s not
the way it would be written in a newspa-
