Married Life In Davidson

Unglamorous, But Amusing

By TODD HOSBIE
Staff Writer

Little glamour is {o be
found in the history of mar
ried students at Davidsan,
but there are some interest:
ing stories and facts.

During Davidson’s first
hundred years married stp-
dents were rare. Ocasionally
there were one or iwo mar
ried students, but they were
not typical. A married stu-
dent. for example. up to the
1930's: might be a man who
at_a late age had decided
to go into the. ministry and
needed (o take some extra
courses.

This rare breed of married
students took a drastic de-
cline toward the end of World
War II. Many students re-
turned from. the war married
and accomodations’ had to
be provided.

Prefabricated structures
were erected in the area
which is now the parking, lot
across Main Street from the
Cunningham Fine Arts: Build
ing. and quickly got the name
“Cardboard Village’’. A few
of these structures are still
in existence today.

According to Scripts ‘N
Pranks’ 1947, summer edi-

‘tion. life was a real challenge

in “Cardboard Village.” It

M.S. A. Working
Toward Housing

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

Last month's chartering of.
the Married Students. As-
sociation (M. S. A.) marked
.a new era.in married life at
Davidson.

Prompted by a desire for.
social ‘contact with other
married students. the organ-
ization should also make the
growing number of married
students a more potent force
in the college community.

The charter represents the
culmination of a process
started last May. when the
{dea for an organization was
brought up at a married
Students’ supper at, the col-
lege church.

It was decided at that time
that the organization would

This summer a_ steering

if they would donate ‘gifts

Charles and Martha also
published a directory con
taining information about
living expenses.. where to

The M. S. A. became a
reality when the married
students met in October and
adopted a constitution. The
group elected Phil Hazel

with Dr. Spencer to discuss

The Dautasontan

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Associate Editor

I was greeted at the door
by Martha Eakes, attractive
wife of Davidson senior
Charles Eakes. She was
flanked by one very energe-
tic young lad on a tricycle
and a female toddler known

s “the baby.”

We were soon joined in the
living room by father Eakes,
who was recovering from a
rather vigorous football game
“with the boys.” ‘‘Very few
people really understand the
situation of the married stu-
dents.’’ said Eakes philoso.
phiically.

“The administration treats

under the apartments, ac-
cording to the stories of the
day.

Several years after the
war the number of married
students declined. But the
presence of married stud-
ents did not return to a
state of rarity. There have
been. a substantial number
of married students and ser-
eral married students’ organ
izations since the war.

us as if we did not really
exist, the students have very
little contact with us and the
townspeople consider us part
of the college.”

The Eakes live in a house
which is owned by the col-
lege, “Yes,
satisfied with our house,’’
said his wife, ‘“‘but this does
not mean it could not be
improved greatly. There is
no heat in our bedroom: and
the kitchen leaks when it
rains, but I guess we can-
not expect the college to
undertake major repairs on
such an old house. We just
wish the college would take
strides to remedy the entire
situation of married student
housing.”

Eakes expanded on this
somewhat: ‘‘We want the ad.
ministration to quit being
indifferent to the married
students,” he said, ‘‘and be
objective about the situation.
Either they encourage stu-
dents to get married, at the
Students’ own expense. or
they. discourage it. It's as
simple as that. They should
make a decision, and take
appropriate steps from that
point.”

In geaeral the Eakes’ at-
titude is typical of that of
most married students at
Davidson. According to Phil
Hazel, 26-year-old Davidson
senior, the married students

we are fairly,

are in ‘‘a state of limbo.”

Davidson men_ consider
them a part of the town be-
cause they live over there,
and townspeople consider
them a part of the college
because they are still in
school.

Students are quick to point
out the advantages of being
married, though. “Lifé is
simply more natural,” said
John Roe, recently married
senior. ‘You don’t have to
live for the weekend, from
one expectation to the next.
Life is more balanced and
enjoyable. Besides that, be-
ing married gives us a
chance to do more things to-
gether, like camping, sail-
ing, going to fraternity par-
ties and attending events at
the college, which we could
not do previously because of
infrequent time spent to-
gether.”

The chief handicap for
some is children. ‘It is hard
to, get babysitters at prices
we can afford,’ said Martha
Eakes. ‘‘Although we attend
all the football and basket-
ball games, we otherwise
limit ourselves to two or
three big outings a year.’’

Mr. and Mrs. Tom Cot-
tingham have found a good
solution to this problem dur-
ing the daytime. ‘We take
our son to the Mt. Zion Nur-
sery during the day,"’ said
Cottingharn. “He seems to
enjoy it immensely, and this
gives my wife the opportun-
ity to hold a full-time job in
Charlotte and me some quiet
study time in the afternoon."

The number of married
students at Davidson is un.
known to most. At the end
of last year there were 41
married students. There are
presently 21 in the student
body, seven of whom have
children. Three more will
get married during Christ-
mas vacation.

Finding something to oc-
cupy. the wives seems to
bother several students.
About half of the wives have
regular jobs. One is a social
worker, another is an ele-

More Americans Marry Younger

Almost Any Other Culture

Than In

By DAVID SWEATT
Managing Editor
A greater proportion of
Americans marry at earlier
ages today than do the peo-
ple of almost any other cul-
ture of the world.

The average age of mar-"

riage in. the United States
has been on the decline since
before the turn of the cen-
tury.

Part of this. gradual move
to younger marriages has in-
cluded college and univer-
sity students across the
country.

The tendency for college
students to get married be-
came noticeable about the
time of World War II and
increased greatly in the wake
of the hostilities.

The Korean War brought
another resurgence of the

tendency with the part-time
jobs of post-war prosperity
playing a large part. par-
ticularly among the urban,
commuter colleges.

It was prosperity continu-
ing into the Sixties that has
sustained the level of stu-
dent marriages. In addition.
middle class and upper class
parents have shown them-
selves more willing to sup-
port married children in col-
lege in recent years.

Sociological surveys have
turned up some consensus
among college marrieds re-
garding their situation. Most
look on marriage as a stabi-
lizing influence. They believe
that marriage combined with
college encourages coopera-
tive adjustment to eact
others’ roles.

But there are negatives

Housing: What Is The

By CHARLES McEWEN
Associate Editor

If Sam Spencer. Robert
Currie and Phil Hazel agree
on one thing, it’s the need
for better housing for mar-
ried students. ;

Each, however, approaches
the problem in a different
way.

Hazel seems fo be asking
the question, how many units
is the college or a private
investor willing to build?
Spencer's question: What
should the college's philo-
sophy and approach to the
problem be? And Currie's:
What is it going to cost and
who will pay?

President of the Married
Students Association, Hazel
is proposing a minimum of
20 apartment units to be
built by the college or by
a private
some control by the college.

He points out that after

investor under

Christmas, there will be 24
married students at David-
son, that the college has only
eight apartment or housing
units available for rent, and

1

that these units are. inade-
quate from several stand-
points.

Hazel said that the actual
building of the apartments

it

was “‘two years off at best.
If we can present the college
with our proposal by the
end of the school year, we
will have done what we

also. Most .married college
students experience financial
hardships: most feel they
are unduly, pressed for time
in their day to day lives.
The arrival of children be-
fore they were desired is not
unusual.

After all the ‘pro's and
woe’s have been said, how-
ever, it appears that campus
marriages are to be a per-
manent part of most college
campuses.

Supporting the rationale of
this trend is evidence brought
to light recently regarding
satisfaction with housing,
economic conditions, and the
study situation. The married
students came out better on
ali three factors than did
their single classmates.

The whole student mar-
riage trend is not surpris-

meant to do.”

Hazel said that he and
other members of the Mar-
ried Students’ Association
will submit a written report
detailing the number, size,
floor plan and location sug-
gested for the proposed
apartments. He added that
this report would be sub-
mitted about the same time
as the report from the five
study commissions.

Proposals for future hous-
ing aside, the main problem
with present housing is
“maintenance,” Hazel said.
He said that those married
students who rent privately
owned real estate find it
“difficult to get landlords to
move.”

But for those eight who
rent from the college, ‘‘the
college does a great job on
maintenance.” he said —
that is, if you know whom
to call, the college sends a

ing in light of recent physio-
logical and psychological evi-
dence in support of the claim
that ‘today’s 18-year-dlds
mature more rapidly than
those of earlier generations.

Physically, today’s young
men and women mature al-
most two years earlier than
in 1900,

More important, perhaps,
“is the evidence which sug-
gests that this earlier physi-
cal maturity is matched by
emotional and intellectual de-
velopment.

So, relatively speaking, to-
day's young man of 18 is
two years older than his: 18-
year-old counterpert of sixty-
eight years ago.

Maybe those early mar-
riages aren't as early as they
statistically appear.

repairman.

Hazel said that in college
housing — the four units in
Jackson Heights or “Card.
board Village,’’ located on
Griffin Street; the two-family
duplex where Hazel lives on
Main Street; and the two-
family apartment house on
Concord Road — the prob-
lem is heating.

Cost of housing rented
privately or from the college
runs from a low of around
$45 a month for un-furnished
apartment to a high of
around $90 for a furnished
apartment.

Apparently, housing is
available for married stud-
ents, since all but three coup-
les now live in the town of
Davidson. But in the con-
text of Hazel’s remarks,
availability should not be
equated with desirability nor
adequacy.

At the end of last year,
however, when Davidson had

mentary school teacher and
several have secretarial posi-
tions.

Under the present rules a
student wife can take one
course a term at Davidsen,
at an expense of $160 per
course.

While many praised the
cultural advantages of the
college, they said the town
was relatively dull, and the
townspeople made little ef.
fort to incorporate them into
the community. Finances
are a limiting factor for
activites, but no one saw
this as a major problem of
being married at Davidson.

as little as $150 per month,”
said Cottingham, “but the

son makes life a little easier
too.

Eakes expressed the real
advantage of being a married
student. “If a couple is ex-
tremely unhappy when they
are apart.” he said, “it is ~
a tremendous psychological
advantage for them to be
together. Our years at David-
son are probably the best of
our lives and we want to
experience them together.”

By AL JASPER
Staff Writer

Jay Schimmel, the true
symbol of the class of ‘69
and son of John and Karen
Schimmel, was found at his
usual seat in. the library re-
cently and consented to an
interview for THE DAVID-
SONIAN.

“Jay, do you like living
off campus?”

“Oh, yes. IT find I'm close
to the library, Union and
Chambers. After all, I credit
living off campus with
John and Karen (I always
call my parents John and
Karen) with the improve-
ment in my speech and phy-
sical growth. That’s a pretty
good answer for a three-year-
old, eh?”

“Not bad. What about
girls?”
“Well, I don't exactly go

for the Playboy set. but as
John once said, you're never
too young to start.”

“What plans do vou have
for next year?’

“I plan to, continue my.

education at either Baylor or
Vanderbilt Med School. Of
course I'll take John and
Karen along to take care of
the house.”

“Has the change in the
drinking rule affected you
at all?"

“No, I can’t say it has.
Karen put her foot down on
that one and won't let me
drink anything but beer .'til
I'm five.”

College’s Responsibility?

experience in the area he
could make no judgment yet
on the economic soundness
of the proposal.

In dealing with the prob-
lem of married student hous-
ing, “the fundamental ques-
tton is the extent to which
the college has responsibil.
ity,” Spencer said.

“This could be answered
in three ways.’’ he said:
That the college has no re-
sponsibility and discourages
student marriages: that the
college recognizes the con-
tinued existence of a group
of married students as a
stable part of the social and
economic pattern of the col-
lege community; that stu-
dent marriages are too few
and the college should en-
courage more of them.

“From each of these would
flow different answers to the
practical questions,’ Spencer
said, ‘“‘but I think we can
eliminate the third one.”
