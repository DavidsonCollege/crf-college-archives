Committee Alters
Reeent Decision

On ‘Cut’

By JOHN McLEAN
Managing Editor

The Faculty Executive
Committee Monday revoked
its announcement of the pre-
vious Friday that students
who had cut more than five
chapels during the term
would be called before the
Faculty Executive Commit
tee to “justify (their) con-
tinuing at Davidson.”

The announcement had
been made in a letter to ali
students who had exhausted
their Quota of three cuts be-
fore the first week in Feb
ruary. .

It had warned these stu-
dents that they would be
campused for 30 days upon
taking their fifth cut, and
would be called before the
Faculty Executive Commit
tee after the sixth cut.

New Rules
Still Being
Debated

Administrative approval is
all that is lacking for a new
set of administrative rules
which were put into final
form at a meeting of the
Dean's Council Wednesday.
according to Richard C.
Burts Jr., dean of students.

The present fraternity cur-
few rules are not included in

this new set in effect,
abolishing this: rule.
However, before this

change — and any of the new
rules — becomes effective
it must be approved by all
members of the administra-
tion, said Burts. Those who
must approve the rules are
Burts, Dean of Faculty
Frontis W. Johnston, Presi-
dent Samuel._R. Spencer Jr.
and Business Manager Ro-
bert A. Currie.

Approval is expected at a
meeting of the administra-
tion early next week. The
meeting was delayed be-
cause Spencer was out of
town this week.”

The rules were drawn up
by the Dean's. Council at the
request of Spencer. The
council is composed of
Burts: James J. Terry, as-
sistant dean of students:
Scott Woodmansee, college
chaplain: Mrs. Peter  Ni-
cholls, director of student
housing: C. Shaw Smith. di-
rector of the College Union:
and Samuel F. Boyte, assis-
tant director of the union.

Policy

The announcement was
withdrawn after protesting
students swamped the dean
of students’ office Monday.

Members of the Execu-
tive Committee were reluc-
tant to say whether their ac-
tion was in response to stu
dent agitation. But Dean of
Students Ricahrd C. Burts
Jr. stressed that the faculty
group had rescinded its rul
ing because of widespread
misunderstanding and mis-
interpretation on the part of
both students and faculty. —

The chapel cut policy now
remains unchanged. A stu
dent losses half of his chape}
euts for the next term ‘if he
overcuts once. If a student
cuts chapel after that. he is
campused for 30 days.

Burts said that he hoped
the move would relax ten.
sion caused by compulsory
chapel controversy and the
walk:out of about 75 students
at chapel last Thursday.

Both student leaders and
members of the Faculty
Executive Committee ex.
‘presed hope that no further
actions would be taken by
students or faculty to ag
gravate the situation.

Burts pointed out the com-
mittee -might view further
walk outs as ‘‘protest for
protest’s sake,’* rather than
as legitimate means of cal-
ling attention to a problem.
The whole matter of chapel
cuts and compulsory chapel
is now under study by a joint.
student-faculty committee.

The current wave of stu-
dent protest against compul-
sory chapel began on No
vember 5, 1968. when the

Absent Members
Stall Convention

By BIFF FINE
Copy Editor
The Constitutionai Conven.
lion continued to flounder in

procedure Wednesday night .

as the necessary one third of
the delegates required to
pass revisions was lacking
for the third time in four
meetings.

Although at least 25 voters
ate hecessary to pass re
visions and only 17 members
were present, Chairman
Dick Allison held the conven
tion in session for discussion
of amendments and tentative
votes on reforms.

The two meetings previ-
ously convened without the
requisite members were. al-
so devoted to discussion and
straw votes. The convention
has now expressed its
opinions and position on most
of the amendments three
times, but no action has been
taken to bring the measures
any nearer to a referendum
than they were when the con
vention first convened.

Franklin Anderson, vice
chairman of the Court of
Appeals, .presented a printed
copy of a proposal for a
College Council to each of
the members present.

The College Council pro
posed would. consist of six
students and six faculty mem.
bers with the president of

3 Fraternities ‘Thinking Local’;
ATO’s May Take The Plunge

At least three campus fra
ternities have taken their

national affiliation under
study, and one of them —
Alpha Tau. Omega — an-

nounced this week that it
was “seriously considering”
going local.

ATO Vice President Greg
Simmons told representa-
tives of nine fraternities.
meeting Tuesday at the ATO
house, that his house was
pondering a local move -
“but that is not to say that
we will do it.”

A special evaluation com
mittee headed by Simmons
has been studying the mat-
ter, Simmons said, and the
ATO’s ‘‘wanted to see what
other fraternities are ‘think-
ing and doing, too.”

The other two fraternities
with committees are Sigma
Chi and Sigma Phi Epsilon.

The Sig Ep committee is
studying its membership
selection process and related
matters as well as the na-
tional-local issue. President
Randy Phillips said. The

Negro Counselor Presents
Black Students’ Problems

By DICK ANDERSON
Staff Writer

Joseph C. Champion is the
counselor at the predomin-
antly Negro West Charlotte
High School. He is a mode-
rate man, but he has strong
feelings about the duties of
a college to its community
and particularly to the cul-
turally deprived students of
the area.

“The first thing you've got
to do is decide how to de.
fine the expression ‘cultur-
ally deprived,’ Champion
told Davidson College's Com-
mission on Extra Campus
Responsibilities last week.
“Some of our students are
from ghetto backgrounds
while others are from what
we blacks would call affluent
backgrounds. Which ones
are culturally deprived?”

Champion also stresses the
difficulty which white ad-
missions officers have in
communicating with black
ghetto youths.

“Many of our students
don’ do well on WAS?.ori-
entec admissions tests made
up by white Anglo Saxon,
Protéstant ed :cators,”
Champion told the commis-
sion, “‘but they could still
handle higher level work.”

Champion said that fre.
quently black students do not

care how they do on admis.

think they will go to college
anyway.

Champion believes that
‘Davidson needs to seek out
and recruit these students.
To the commission he sug
gested’ that they obtain
copies of .recruiting reports
put out by such institutions
as Columbia, the University
of Wisconsin and Harvard,

“Harvard sends recruiters
down here fairly often,”
Champion said. ‘Davidson

anybody that year, and gave

might be able to find one or
two or three out of 1700 who
could go to Davidson."

Champion feels that Da-
vidson’s only real disad-
vantage is that it is an all.
male school, and _ that
prospective Negro students
might be put off by the re.
sulting lack of social life.

On the other hand, he says
that there is no question
about the college's academic
strength, although ‘“‘you need
black professors to prepare
students for integrated life
after graduation, and you
need an Afro-American stu-
dies program. How are you
going to understand the
black man unless you know
his history? A lot of white
students would agree with
me on that.”*

The Sigma Chi's will be

set-up, the concept of frater.
nities here and possible fa

tion, New said.

ATO representatives said
at Tuesday's meeting that
any local move would be
prompted by the desire to

“If we went local, we
could decide how we wanted
to spend our money. re.
write our ritual and possibly
change our membership
selection procedures,” senior
Jim Cooley said.

Curfews
Suspended

The Dean's Council decided
Thursday to suspend the fra-
ternity house curfew rule to-
night and Saturday night
during Midwinters weekend.

According to a letter cir.
culated from the Dean of
Students’ office to all frater-
nity presiderts, ‘Your friend.
ly administration announces
that for the coming weekend
during Midwinters, on an ex-
perimental basis. a curfew
will not be enforced."

The letter said the Union
would remain open through
out the weekend at all times.

James J. Terry, assistant
dean of students, emphasized
that the rule is only experi-
mental! and the regular cur-
few will be in effect Sunday
night.

“Mystic goodies are for
high school — they'ré kid's
stuff,"" Simmons said.

Representatives of | other
fraternities at Tuesday's
meeting, however, pointed
to a number of benefits af.
forded fraternities by their
national offices.

Pi Kappa Alpha President
Sam Tallman cited the
“financial discipline’ that
nationals provide, and he
said that arguments against
the blackball and ritual were
“trivial, since actually you
can circumvent those.”

Tallman said. however.
that he is ‘‘personally, pro
local.”’

He and the other
fraternities’ representatives
agreed that the ATO's ‘‘are
in some respects a special
case."’ The ATO representa
tives told the group that their
fraternity's ties with alumni
are weak, since it is a re
fatively new chapter, and
that they do not count heavi-
ly on financial assistance
from their national organi-
zation.

Policy Problem
Snares Senate

By DANNY WHITE
Associate Editor

The SGA Senate shuddered
through a change in leader
ship Wednesday as new SGA
President Peter Hobbie pre.
sided over his first Senate,
a meeting highlighted by a
debate over the appointive
powers of the president and
the Senate Executive Com
mittee (SEC).

Before the debate, which
-was sparked by the SEC nu
minations. for Senate appoint.
ed committees, the. Senate
heard a report from John
Williams on the affairs of
the Educational Policy Com
mittee.

Williams told the Senate
that he felt students had
been “badly burned” by the
faculty’s negative vote on the
question of self scheduled
exams.

The proposal has since
been referred back to the
Educational Policy Commit-
tee,, of which Williams is a
member. for further study.
Williams also told the sena
tors that their proposal on
voluntary ROTC had been
sent to the Educational Po
licy Committee from the of
fice of the dean of faculty.

The senators managed to
appoint the Senate Execu-
tive Committee before they
broke into debate over other
SEC nominations. The SEC
will include Peter Hobbie,
Tom Opie, Todd Hobbie, Ce
cil Burney. Sterling Aber
nathy,. Dan Herd and Rich
Cowart.

A coalition of senators
headed by Jim Hinshaw.
Cecil Burney and Gary Cash

opposed the remaining nomi-
nations on the basis that
they in effect gave the SEC
legislative power and also
the Senate too little power
over appointments. Burney
said that the SEC meeting
had been rather superficial
and had not really measured
the merits of those that
signed up.

Hobbie argued that the.
SGA Constitution allocated
all nominating power to the
SEC and gave the Senate
only the power of confirma-
tion. He also expressed his
disappointment in a Senate
that would be involved in
minor legal hassles and neg.
lect. the real duties of its
representative institution.

Hobbie’s. argument failed
to carry and the Senate de.
cided to send the nomina-
tions back to the SEC for
further study.

Jewett

Heads
Study

An eight-member commit:
tee working toward a pos
sible experimental coeduca-
tion week here in May got’
an endorsement from the
.studént Senate this week
and a unanimous pledge of
support from the Residence
Hall Council.

The committee, organized
and chaired hy freshman
Jonny Jewett. was also in-
stalled. as an official SGA
committee.

Tentative plans,  contin-
gent upon the. approval of
the faculty and administra-
tion, call for. some 200-250
girls to visit here in early
May. Jewett said.

The week. is being planned
on an exchange basis, he
added, whereby an equal
number of Davidson students |
will visit the campuses from
which the girls come.

He said feelers had already
been sent to Agnes Scott.
Converse. Hollins. Mary
Baldwin, Randolph Macon
and Sweetbriar.

The visitation idea has
been tried by a number of
schools, particularly in the
East. Last year. Yale, which
recently, decided to admit
female students on a regu-
lar basis. hosted several
hundred girls for a week.
Princeton did the same this

Coffee Cup Still

Divided

By NORWOOD POLAND
Staff Writer

The Coffee Cup restaurant
in Davidson may no longer
be strictly segregated, but
the barrier that still separ
ates the two sides of the es
tablishment remains some
thing of an enigma.

Mrs. Bryant Sigmon. whose
husband operates the rest
aurant, said the partition is
just a coat rack. However,
the rack effectively divides
the dining room into. two
separate parts.

have tried to sit on the ‘‘col-
ored’’. side of the room, but
have been refused service -
there. Mike Roth and Jim
Blair. who have tried to eat
there. several times, said
they have usually had to.
move to the ‘‘white’’ side
to be served.

“Mrs. Sigmon gives a dif-
ferent reason for making us
move each. time.'' Roth said.
“Several students have been
served on the ‘black’ side.
only after long. delays and
after repeatedly asking to be
waited on."

Negroes apparently are
served on either side of the
partition, however. Tony
Knox of Johnson's Barber
Shop said he has been served
with no trouble on both sides.

Mrs. Emma Payne, a wait-
ress in the Wildcat Den, said
that local Negroes know
they're not welcome on the
“white’’ side, though.

With reference to white
students being refused ser-
vice on the “black” side.
she said, “You just paint
your face next time you go
in there. and they'll serve
you on that side,, all right.”

Ken Norton. proprietor of
Norton's Barber Shop. said
that he too has eaten on both
sides of the partition. but
that he does not feel ‘unwel-
come there. ‘I don't believe
the Sigmons are]trying to
discriminate,’ Norton said.
“The coat rack stays there
because there is no other:
place to put it.”
