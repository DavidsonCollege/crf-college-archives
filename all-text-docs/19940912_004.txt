Students receive high room damage bills over summer

By Mary Clare Jalonick

In the middle of summer va-
cation, many students opened their
mailboxes to find unexpected bills
from the Davidson College
Controller’s office. For some, the
large amount of money: charged
for room damages was an unpleas-
ant surprise.

“Tt ate up a big chunk of my
summer’s earnings,” says one
sophomore with an unusually high
bill, “and I thought that the room
was in good condition.”

Many students were sur-
prised to find that the bills were
much higher than in previous years.
Some had wittingly caused minor
damage to their rooms, expecting

RLOassessments to be the same as
in the past.
Why are charges higher?

Richard Terry, Dean of Resi-
dence Life, explains that the higher
charges were necessary. “In past
years, the rooms have been in-
spected by students hired by our
office. The amounts charged never
quite covered the amount spent on
repair, so the Physical Plant in-
spected the rooms themselves this
year.”

The Physical Plant’ s estimates
were reportedly much more accu-
rate than those of RLO employees.
Terry calls the charges “more ob-
jective than ever before.”

Before last year, RLO com-

pensated for the cost that was not
paid by students. Since RLO is no
longer responsible for this com-
pensation, the office has extra
funds. However, Terry says, “It’s
all the same ball of wax’”’; student
tuition money pays for all RLO
funds.
Alternative billing proposals
Some students have suggested
putting a surcharge on the tuition
bill so that damages would already

be paid for by each student when

the end of the year comes.

Terry opposes this proposal
for two reasons. First, students
who keep good care of their rooms
should not have to pay anything.
Second, since damages would al-

Abscences weaken history department for fall

By Beth Lindsey

Students searching for history
courses during the scheduling pro-
cess this semester were dismayed
to discover a smaller number of
classes being offered than usual.

Junior Jenny Reinhoehl says,
“It was extremely frustrating for
history majors not to be able to
receive the classes they wanted.”
Other students were merely disap-
pointed with the lack of variety
represented in the courses. Emily
Davis, ajunior history major, could
not get a course that she needed
and was interested in for her major.
“There simply were not enough
options—especially in the 300-
level courses,” says Davis.

Six of the history department's
15 professors are away this semster.
While Dr. Price Zimmerman is on
his regular sabbatical (every seven
years), Dr. Job Thomas is leading
the Davidson semester trip to In-
dia. Dr. Sally McMillan has taken
a leave of absence to complete her
current book. Dr. Vivian Dietz is
taking advantage of time provided
by the college for professors on the
tenure track to complete necessary
research. Afterreceiving the honor
of being “elected to membership”
in the Institute for Advanced Stud-
ies, Dr. Jonathan Berkey is at
Princeton. Dr. Barbara Ballard
received notice during the summer
that she had received a post-doc-
toral research grant.

The department did attempt to

replace Professor Ballard; how-
ever, due to the late notification of
her absence, a replacement could
not be found. History Department
Head Dr. Malcolm Partin says, “We
held interviews for the position but
didn’t feel the candidates could do
the job we wanted done. There-
fore, no offers were made.”

Partin agrees that the number
of classes offered this fall is smaller
than usual, but he feels that the
department has by no means been
depleted this semester. Professor
David Munsick has been hired as a
visiting professor and is teaching
two classes this fall and three in the
spring. Partin also points out that
two of the six professors gone this
semester would not have been
teaching a full load of history
courses this fall due to their par-
ticipation in the Humanities pro-
gram and Thomas’ involvement in
the art department.

Most importantly, Partin re-
ports, “There was no great flood of
majors who didn’t find something
during drop/add this semester.”
While all senior majors had spots
in the mandatory Senior
Colloquium, the regular number
of senior seminars was also of-
fered. Ceilings were also raised in
cases where it was deemed neces-
sary.

While the 300-level courses
were the hardest hit, “the only real
complication occurred when Pro-
fessor Ballard’s 240 class was listed

in the spring but then could not be
offered,” says Partin. Firmly be-
lieving the position would be filled,
the class was left on the course
listing; however, when the replace-
ment was not found, the class sim-
ply could not be staffed.

Partin says it comes down toa
balance between an excess of “‘stu-
dent inconveniences” and provid-
ing the staff with enough opportu-
nities for “professional scholar-
ship.” The department was hit
with more needed absences than
usual.

As far as the remaining staff is
concerned, there is no added strain
on other history professors. Partin
says, “Some ceilings are higher,
but this has been done before.” A
regularly-scheduled departmental
study will begin despite all the
absences, but it does not necessar-
ily need to be completed this year.

So where does this leave stu-
dents searching forhistory courses?
Partin says to look to the spring for
more history courses than usual.
According to the current schedule
for the spring, seven seminars will
be offered, along with seven 300-
level courses with European,
American, and even Mexican his-
tory well-represented. With many
staff members returning well-
rested and more knowledgeable
than ever, students will find no
shortage in the number or variety

of history classes offered this

spring.

ready be paid, students might be
more careless with their rooms.
Where do damage charges go?
The money paid by each student
goes toward labor and material.
Many rooms must be spackled and
replastered, and each room is re-
painted every five years.

If a room looks like it will
have to be repainted in less than
five years, then a student may be
charged for a percentage of the
painting that will be done. For
example, if a room will have to be
repainted after four years (20%
earlier than normal), the student
might be charged 20% of the cost
to repaint.

How can students avoid charges?

Terry advises students to steer
away from foam adhesive tape and
large nails. Herecommends scotch
tape, smaller nails and tacks. He
also says that it is important to
remove the nails in such a way that
will remove as little plaster as pos-
sible from the walls.

Pleased with the outcome of
the new system, Terry welcomes
any student to come by and review
their check-out forms with him.
He can explain the costs and re-
evaluate them if there is a discrep-
ancy.

In general, he expects most
charges to be accurate: “I have
great faith in their (the Physical
Plant’s) assessments.”
