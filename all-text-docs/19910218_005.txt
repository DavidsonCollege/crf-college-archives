1991 Student Government Association Elections: Questions & Answer

Covington: We have the Trustee
Contact Committee, but we have a
problem right now jin that not
enough senators realize how great
their role can be with the trustees.
My relationship with Mr. Wall is
very good. I received a letter from
him last night, and he wants me to
check on his schedule to see when
we could talk to me about the ath-
letics policy, specifically the ques-
tions surrounding Division I and
Division III status.

The senators can be more in-
strumental with the trustees if they
take the initiative to do so, and that
is something I am going to encour-
age. Students can influence the
trustees more than they think.

Davidsonian: How would you see
yourself differing from this year’s
president?

Covington: In my three years on -

the senate, I have seen the presi-
dents take on many different roles,
from Harrison Murray to Tripp
Helms to Doug Jobe. I think-that
assertivenessand visibility are two
important characteristics of the
president. We are part of a larger
community than just Davidson
College, especially with Charlotte
so close, so an SGA president re-
ally needs to make their name
known everywhere. I consider
myself to be very outgoing an
strong in this regard, :

Davidsonian: What do you think
separates you from the other presi-

- dential candidates?

Covington: I think the character-
istics I have stated earlier, using
my name as an anacronym, espe-
cially my experience and articula-
tion, set me apart from the other
candidates. I feel that lam uniquely
qualified for the office. In other
words, it just feels right.

Prem Manjooran

Most of you here know me. My
name is Prem Manjooran, and I’m
running for SGA president. The
decision to run was nota hasty one
atall. The idea has been in the back
of my mind for two years. In fact,
the genesis of the decision was
formed during my tenure as Inde-
pendent Senator my sophomore
year. ‘It has suited me to work
within the SGA. I have realized
that there is so much to be done,
that could be done, and so much
that has been left undone because
of situations in which senators felt
that they were being compromised,
I genuinely believe that in the
past couple of years or so, the SGA
president has run for reasons other
than to serve the college commu-
nity - additional material on the
résumé being one of those factors.
It’s just that I have seen, in my
years on the SGA, numerous in-
stances when the officers of the
student government have backed
down, or refused to take a hard
enough stance on something as
critical as minus grades, extended
semesters, or other faculty-intro-
duced changes. aed
It’s all very well to say that the
students should have a voice in the
collegecommunity. What hasbeen
forgotten, I think, is that without

the students, there would be no
faculty, noadministration. Itis the
students that determine the neces-
sity of having a faculty and ad-
ministration. Therefore, I genu-
inely believe that the studénts
should have a greater say in the
affairs of the college.

I’m not here tonight in order to
make any dramatic speeches, dra-
matic promises, or to offer any

statement of purpose. All I’m here
to offer youis my accessibility, my
commitment, and my experience.
Ihave learned alotin my two years
on the SGA tobe able tohandle the
situations required of an SGA presi-

fied. The three of tis are all expe-
rienced and committed, but what I
think sets me apart is my diverse
involvement with various aspects
of campus life. Since my freshman
year, I have worked in various
places on campus, inthe Com-
mons, in the Union, with the Inter-
national Committee as well as
many other committees.

The decision is not going to be
an easy one. Thank you.

Davidsonian: You are running
against twocandidates who, as you
say, are also very qualified for the
office of SGA president. What is
the one thing that sets you apart
from your competition?

Manjooran: 1 would have to say
that it is my unquestioning, un-
swerving devotion and commit-
ment to the school.

Davidsonian: You mentioned
‘taking a stand’. Would youelabo-
rate?

Manjooran: My primary point of
contention is that the faculty and
administration seem to give us a
second-rate status in terms of evalu-
ating policy decisions.

An example of this is the minus
grades situation. When minus
grades came about, they were pre-
sented without any forewarning at
all. When they decided to change
the length of semesters, we, again,
had.no forewarning at all. These
decisions were made behind closed
doors.

I would definitely like to think
that, as SGA president, I will be
fully included in the decision mak-
ing process. I believe that the stu-
dents need a representative on
every one of these faculty com-
missions. That will be my strong-
est stand.”

I'm here to offer you my accessibility, my commit-
ment, and my experience. I have learned a lot in
my two years on the SGA to be able to handle the
situations required of an SGA president.

dent,

I also think that my commit-
ment to the school is something to
be glad about. Davidson has given
mealot, and that’s not justin terms
of the money that’s been given to
me to go to school here. It’s given
mealotin terms of the friendships
I have been able to establish and
the relationships I have been able
to build. That includes my rela-
tionships with faculty and admini-
stration as well as students.

I see the presidency as an op-
portunity to pay back the commu-
nity for something it’s given me.
My experience this year as a Hall
Counselor has taught me, if noth-
ing else, there’s much to be given
to this community, and the com-

' munity can give that much more
back in return. That is the main
reason that I am prepared to com-
mit myself entirely to this commu-
nity.

It’s not been an easy decision to
run, and I guess that all three can-
didates are extremely well quali-

Davidsonian: Alcohol has, obvi-
ously, beenaproblem at Davidson
this year. What projects do you see
the SGA undertaking with the Trus-
tees towards either changing the
alcohol policy or keeping the status
quo?

Manjooran: From my personal
experience, especially as a Hall
Counselor this year, I have en-
countered varying stages of drunk-
enness around the college. I do
firmly believe that banning alco-
hol from the campus will not keep
people from drinking.

I would much rather see stu-
dents stagger back from a court
party than have them driving back

. tocampus drunk. I believe that the

school has to take ‘a stand on the
alcohol policy. If Davidson has
the most liberal alcohol policy of
any of the schools around us, I
believe thatis for the better. I think
that half the purpose is to teach
students to drink responsibly, not
to tell them notto drink. I think the

faculty can make the students re-
alize that it is their responsibility.
I think the Trustees are full aware
of that as well, that alcohol is
something you have to deal with
on campus.

Vice Presidential
Candidates

Vashist Worah

I’m Vashisht Worah, I’m from
Calcutta, and’ m ajunior Physics
major here at Davidson. The pri-
mary reason why I want to run for
SGA vice president is because I
would like to be directly involved
with the committees thatthe SGA
sponsors. The committees are
how the SGA functions. Most of
the decisions the SGA makes are
based on the information provided
by committee chairs. The pri-
mary role of the vice president is
to look over the activities of the
standing committees.

As an analogy, I could say that

the role of SGA president
is like that of the CPU of a com-

even acknowledged by the rest of
the campus.

In the past, we have had numer-
ouscommittees which have worked
on this problem, and have heard
numerous suggestions including a
Minority Affairs Office. The of-
fice would deal with concerns of
minority students. There should
be; in-my opinion,-more- direct
contact or more direct coordina-
tion between the BSC and the
Solidarity committee. The events
they plan should be planned to-
gether, they should be campus
wide.

Security also takes up a lot of
discussion on the SGA. Fall se-
mester there was a great deal of
talk, but in the spring the topic has
been somewhat glazed over. Ray
Thrower has become a little bit
less accessible than he was last
semester. Onc of the things I would
like to initiate is a bit more regular
contact with Ray Thrower.

As an RA I have good contact
with the Residence Life Office,
whichI can bring to the SGA. The
biggest project they have for next
year is the new apartment build-
ing, which, if I’m elected vice
president, I hope to follow up onin
close detail. Thankyou.”

Davidsonian: How exactly would
you keep the RLO on their sched- -
ule towards the construction of the
apartment building?

Worah: Well, there’s nothing that
I or even the Senate can do to
facilitate the building of the thing
itself, but what we can do is keep
them on their toes. Given that | am
inthe RLO almost every day, Ican
keep asking about it and have in-
formation flowing back and forth
between the RLO and the SGA.
That way the student body will be
aware of what’s going on.

Davidsonian:.1n your opinion, to
what extent does the SGA influ-
ence the adoption of college pol-
icy?

Worah: | think it all depends on
the way the matter is pursued.
There are just some issues about
which the faculty are open for input
but aren’t really going to change
their stance because of the SGA.

The primary concern which I would like to ad-
dress, and which I would like to influence as SGA
vice president is that of the minority situation at

Davidson.

puter, whereas the role of the vice
president is like that-of the lines
which carry the information to the

CPU and back from the CPU toall -

the other parts of the computer.
The primary concern which I
would like to address, and which I

would like to influence as SGA -

vice president is that of the minor-
ity situation at Davidson. In my
opinion, having been a Love of
Learning Counselor/Mentor this
past summer, the minorities who
come to Davidson do face a great
many difficulties which are most
often ignored, looked over, or not

Davidsonian: You mentioned
minority concerns. Whatsteps will
you take to pursue this issue?

Worah: There is never really any
integration of minority students on
the campus. If minorities and
members of the BSC want a tradi-
tionally black fraternity, that’s fine
with me. I would also suggest a
cultural festival like the kind the
international students have.

Davidsonian: What changes do
you see coming to the alcohol
policy?
