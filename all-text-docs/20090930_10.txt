An upsetting weekend for NCAA’s ranked teams

This weekend was a subtle reminder that
college football is a game played by young
men on a field, not on paper by expert ana-
lysts. After a multitude of upsets, 15 teams
have moved at least three spots in the Asso-
ciated Press Poll, while Florida, Texas and
Alabama retained their top rankings. This
wild weekend certainly captivated football
fans everywhere, but considering the past
few weeks, it’s not that surprising.

In week one, the country saw last year’s
Heisman Trophy winner Sam Bradford go
down in the second quarter with a fairly seri-
ous shoulder injury. Consequently, his third-
ranked Oklahoma Sooners opened the season
with a 14-13 loss at the hands of the BYU
Cougars, threatening Oklahoma’s hope for a
chance at a national title.

The following week, unranked Houston,
behind a potent offensive attack, outscored
fifth-ranked Oklahoma State 45-35. Hous-
ton, of Conference USA, beat a top five team
for the first time since they took down third-
ranked Texas in 1984.

Last weekend, two unranked teams cut
down top-10 teams, setting the college foot-
ball world aflame.

Third-ranked USC, coming off an im-
pressive victory over eighth-ranked Ohio
State, fell to Washington (winless in 2008)
16-13, as Washington’s Erik Folk kicked a
22-yard field goal with just three seconds re-

maining to give the Huskies the lead. BYU,
ranked seventh, disappointed its fans and all
of those hoping to see a non-BCS conference
team in the national title game when it laid
an egg against unranked Florida State, losing
54-28.

All of those games were just preparing us
for what happened this weekend. Unranked
squads unexpectedly knocked off the fourth,
fifth and sixth teams in the AP Poll.

On Thursday night, the Ole Miss Reb-
els ventured into Columbia, SC, looking to
prove themselves worthy of their No. 4 rank-
ing. They failed miserably, losing to the
Gamecocks 16-10 while the Rebels’ Jevan
Snead crumbled under the pressure, complet-
ing only seven of his 21 passes.

Following suit on Saturday, No. 5 Penn
State lost to Iowa 21-10. Iowa has now de-
feated Penn State seven out of their last eight
meetings. Penn State came into this week-
end with a national title on its mind, now it
has to be hoping to get by Ohio State just to
have a chance at the Big Ten title.

No. 6 California completed the trifecta,
as Oregon destroyed them 42-3. Next week,
Cal will square off with USC, hoping to
bounce back from this devastating defeat.

No. 7 LSU avoided an upset at Mississip-
pi State as the Tigers’ defense stood strong,
stopping the Bulldogs just inches short of the
goal line in the waning minutes of the game,
escaping with a 30-26 victory.

After the pollsters have voted, the rank-
ings for this week have LSU at fourth and

The Wildcat offense compiled 351 yards of total offense in the team’s 24-7 win over
Campbell and hope to put together a similar performance Saturday at Jacksonville.

a

Boise State at fifth, while Virginia Tech,
USC, Oklahoma, Ohio State and Cincinnati
round out the top 10. No. 11 TCU and No. 12
Houston lurk just outside of the top 10.

Only five of the teams that were ranked
in the top 10 in week one are still there now.
These malleable rankings paint an interesting
picture of the young college football season,
at least until this point anyway.

First, no team outside of the top three
have proved themselves invincible. More
important, smaller teams from non-BCS con-
ferences such as Boise State, TCU and Hous-
ton are holding their own against respectable
competition.

With a fifth place ranking and no big tests
looming on their schedule, Boise State has a
legitimate shot at going undefeated. If they
accomplish that task, will they play for the
national championship in Pasadena? Abso-
lutely.

I can only imagine Florida going unde-
feated in the most competitive conference in
the country, the SEC. I think Texas will lose
to Oklahoma after Bradford returns. That’s
right, if Boise State can win the remainder
of its regular season games, it will face-off
against Tim Tebow and the Florida Gators
for the national title.

Remember, it’s early and, if we have
learned anything, nothing is for sure. Boi-
se State still has to win its games and other
teams have to lose, but this could be the year
that a non-BCS team gets a chance to play in
the national championship game.

Football, from page 12

The Dolphin offense is led by Josh
McGregor, who has thrown for 677 yards on
41-85 passing and seven touchdowns. Rudell
Small anchors the ground game with 58 car-
ries for 242 yards and two touchdowns. Josh
Philpart has been McGregor’s favorite target,
hauling in 19 passes for 336 yards and two
touchdowns.

Davidson dealt the Dolphins their only
league loss last season, winning 38-35 after
rallying from a 21-point deficit to win at last
year’s Homecoming. The Wildcats overcame
217 rushing yards from Small to claim the
victory.

Faced with a 35-14 hole, Ryan Alexander
’09 hit Myles Potter 09 for an 80-yard scor-
ing strike. Mantuo scored from one yard out
before Alexander hit Kirk Konert 09 for a
three-yard score to tie the game at 35. The
comeback was complete when Ben Behrendt
"11 drilled a 23-yard field goal in the game’s
final minute.

This year’s Davidson team will look to
win its second in a row against the Dolphins
in its conference road opener. The team is
hopeful that it can “maintain the intensity we
had against Campbell,” defensive back Bran-
don Sykes ’11 said.
