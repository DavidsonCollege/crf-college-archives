Construction will

According to Registrar and
graduation planner Polly Griffin,
thecollege “plan[s] to break ground
on the Life Sciences Building dur-
ing early Spring [1997], so it can

be open for classes by fall 1998.” -

This means that the school
will most likely not hold gradua-
tion in the shaded area in front of

Dana Science Building, as it has
every year in the recent past. This
ground breaking is dependent upon
the college reaching a certain per-
centage of its goal of $12 million
for the project. Griffin says “We
think that it is likely [that we will
realize that goal in time to break
ground.]”

At one point this goal seemed
far-reaching, but a $2 million do-
nation from Frances and Lenox

Baker earlier this semester helped
the project move forward faster
than expected.

Seniors Charlotte Seigler and
Brian Woodward will sit on the
Commencement Planning Com-
mittee as co-chairs of the senior
class committee. Seigler says,
“Their goal is not to disrupt our
graduation, but if they don't break
ground before graduation then they
can’t reach their goal of having the

building open by fall of 1998.”

Griffin says, “If we begin con-
struction in early Spring, we will
adjust the location of the gradua-
tion ceremony to another site on
the front campus. Commencement
over the years has been on at least
three other sites in front of Cham-
bers, and that history will be useful
in our planning.”

She and other administrators
have already taken walking tours

most likely move graduation

of campus to look at prospective
graduation sites. As of now, Grif-
fin says that administrators have a
few ideas in mind. She cites the
areas in front of Cunningham and
near the well as two that “come to
mind right away.”

She says they are looking for
a location where 5,000 people can
sit. in the shade. “There is a lot of
land out there,” she says. “We have
a lot of good options.”

Snowflakes hanging from the flourescent
lights, freshman halls prepared for Christmas.

Cutting and pasting with “Rudolph the Red-

Transcripts
to list labs

A recommendation that the
laboratory components of sci-
ence department courses be
listed separately on academic
transcripts was put forth at a
meeting of the Educational
Policy Committee last Tuesday.

Registrar Polly Griffin, the
EPC member chiefly responsible
for the proposal, says the’ sepa-
rate listing of labs is part of a

you’ re using your mind and creativity and for just
a few hours you’re a child again.”

“And it’s much more fun than flickerball,”
said Melanie Dodd, class of ‘00.

“Everyone was together into the wee hours of
the morning gluing, glittering, and cutting. Then
we all went out for pizza when it was done.”

Although it was difficult to cut out the 105th
star, the spirit of the holidays was evident in any
freshman hall.

The halls were judged by Professor John
Swallow and others on Sunday night. The win-
ners will be announced on Monday.

reports and student transcripts.

Griffin says the issue is one
she has discussed with both sci-
ence department faculty mem-
bers and members of the Student
Government Association’s
Council on Academic Affairs.

Set for implementation in
the fall of 1997, the standard
separate listing for science de-
partment course labs will read as
follows: “LA Laboratory-un-
graded.”

Griffin notes that the regis-
tration procedure for science
courses with labs will remain
unchanged as will denotation of
the student’s overall course grade

_on the transcript.

Says Griffin, “We’ve re-
ceived several calls from vari-
ous graduate schools, and be-
lieve that the new listing change
will ultimately lend them more
descriptive student transcripts.”

According to Chemistry De-
partment Chair, Dr. Felix Carroll,
“Listing labs separately on de-
partment enrollmentreports will
provide more clarity in instances
where one professor teaches the
lecture component of the course,
and another the lab.”

Carroll predicts the lab list-
ing change will make for an easier

“evaluation of Davidson tran-

scripts by employers, as well as
graduate and professional
schools.
