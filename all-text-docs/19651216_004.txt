Dean Praises Leaders

In Tapping

Ceremony

Dean of Faculty Frontis Johnston delivered the
address for Omicron Delta Kappa’s fall tapping
ceremony in chapel Monday.

Replacing on short notice Davidson Alumni As-
sociation President William A. White, who was taken
ill the night before, Dean Johnston rose to the oc-
casion with a speech that drew upon his 30 years’
experience. He complimented the student body for
its current leaders, and he pointed out that the col-
lege enjoyed its periods of excellence. growth and
enrichment only when there was strong student ©

leadership.

He advised those who would aspire to be leaders
to learn above all else “simplicity in its best sense.”
Leaders need not possess mysterious qualities; rather
they must have the “time-tested virtues” in extra-

ordinary degree.

In all things, the dean advised, be yourself.
Although a leader need not be different, he must
be sincere, for “the pattern of your life is but a mir-

ror of your soul.”

Upon completion of Dean Johnston’s remarks,
Billy Clark presided over the tapping of students, as-

cil.

Davidsonian Staff Writer

The first effort of Davidson's
Project of the Americas to ex-
pand across the state was a
“tremendous success.’"’ accord-
ing to Glenn Withrow, chapter
coordinator.

Last weekend Davidson repre-
sentatives visited six other North
Carolina colleges to introduce
their year-old program. They
talked to administrators, student
leaders and student organiza-
tions at Carolina. N. C. State.
Duke. Wake Forest, UNC-G and
A&T College.

“‘As a result. two chapters are
already established — at UNC-G
and A&T,” said Withrow, ‘‘and
they're holding meetings at the
other places this week.”

Project of.the Americas, a
Davidson-oriented organization
“‘to improve the relations within
our hemisphere through better
cultural understanding.” was
started by Fred Ehlers, a 1964-
65 Richardson Scholar from.
Quito, Ecuador.

Originally a type of Ecuador-
ian Peace Corps for Davidson
students, the group hopes to
send students from all over
North Carolina to Peru, Colom-
bia. Bolivia and possibly Pan-
ama. as well as Ecuador, this
summer.

“The way in which we were
received around the state was
very good.” said Withrow.
“People just couldn't believe
that a group of students could
put something like this together
in one year. They were very im-
pressed and very enthused.”

Project of the Americas calls
its expansion program “'Opera-
tion Explosion,” and Withrow

President To Hear
Oratorio Singers

The Oratorio Singers of Char-
lotte, led by Donald B. Plott.
mus'‘c director, will be the fea-
tured chorus when President
Lyndon B. Johnson lights the
National Christmas Tree tomor-
row.

The ceremony will take place
in the President’s Park behind
the White House in Washington
and will be televised live on al!
national networks at 5 p.m.

The chorus, which is composed
of 150 singers. will perform the
“Hallelujah Chorus’ from the
Messiah at the time President
Johnson lights the tree. The cho-
Tus will alternately present mus-
ical selections with the United
States Marine Band.

The Oratorio Singers will also
present a half-hour concert in
the Rotunda of the Senate O°-
fice Building tomorrow at 1 p.m.
Officials in Washington estimate
that this will be the largest cho-

rus ever to sing in the Rotunda,
which traditionally has choral
concerts during the Yuletide
season. .

Donald B. Plott, director of
the Oratorio Singers for six sea-
sons, is chairman of the Music
Department.

about it.”

Self-Study

By MIKE HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Associate Editor
(An Analysis)

The average Davidson profes-
sor is overworked and under-
paid in comparison to his coun-
terpart in superior colleges out-
side the South, according to the
Self-Study Faculty Committee.

Improvement in the formal
teaching load, from 15 semester
hours per week to 12 semester
hours per week, was noted. But
the large sizes of many courses
in the core curriculum seemed
to off-set the gains in more di-
rect instructor-student confront-
ation.

Trustees, Bureaucracy
Need Full Revamping

By JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Associate Editor

(An Analysis)

A revamping of the Board of
Trustees with respect to its size
and composition is the major re-
commendation put forth by the
recent Self-Study’s Committee
on Organization and Administra-
tion.

The committee's report also
recommended a sweeping reor-
ganization of the college admin-
istration with respect to its chan-
nels of responsibility.

Recommending that the Board
of Trustees be reduced to ap-
proximately one-half its present
size, the committee noted that
**some members of the Board of
Trustees might take a more per-
sonal interest in the work of that
body and might feel a greater
sense of responsibility if the
size of the Board were reduced
to a point where each individual
on it would be able to engage
actively in committee work.”

“The idea here.’ notes corm-
mittee chairman Dr. John C.
Bailey. “is that all of the Board
members could have active
work assignments and thus they
would get to know the college
better, take a greater interest
‘n their work on the Board and
perhaps make greater contribu-
tions in the service of the col-
lege.”

The Self Study group further
favored representation on the
Board from the General As-
sembly of the Presbyterian
Church, U. S. and from “‘one or
two members-at-large from
among persons with outstanding
training and experience in the
field of higher education” in ad-
dition to the present representa-
tion from the supporting pres-
byteries in North Carolina and
Florida and from the Alumni
Association.

It also sugg sted that ‘‘the col-
lege wuld probably benefit by
the presence of more men on
the Board who are graduates of
institutions other than David-
son.”

The Organization and Admin-
istration group emphasized to a
great extent the excess of re-
sponsibilities and duties, both
formal and informal, which bur-
den the president of the college,
and proposed as partial solution
a reorganization of the lines of

responsibility in the college ad-
ministration. with only four per-
sons reporting directly to the
president: the dean of the facul-
ty... the dean of students, the
director of Public relations and
the treasurer and business man-
ager.

The major changes in the pro-
posed. reorganization would: be
that the director of Admissions.
the director of the library, the
director of athletics and the
registrar would report directly
to the dean of the faculty instead
of. to the president, and the di-
rector of student counseling and
the director of the College Union
would report to the dean of stu-
dents instead of directly report-
ing to the president.

Particular emphasis was plac-
ed on the need for removing
from the president the burden
of dealing directly with many of
the numerous departmental and
personal problems of the faculty,
such as salary and promotional
problems.

The recommendation was
made. ‘‘that members of the
facuity discuss with the dean of
faculty all matters having to do
with personal status and with the
work of individual departments
of the college; that if a satisfac-
tory conclusion cannot be reach-
ed in this manner, the matters
may be taken to the president
of the college by either or both
parties involved.”

A further recommendation
was that the dean of students
impose penalties on students for
violation of the faculty rules,
with the student having the right
of appeal to the faculty Execu-
tive Committee, rather than the
Executive Committee being the
original court of jurisdiction in
such matters.

Comments Bailey, ‘‘Here we
are just trying to reduce the
time demands on the nine mem-

bers of the committee in cases
where specific punishments for
violations have been designated
by the faculty. This recommend-
ation would in no way infringe
upon a student’s right of appeal
to the Executive Committee if he
were djssatisfied with the deci-
sion of the dean of students,”

A reorganization of the office
of treasurer and business man-
ager was recommended, includ-
ing suggestions for the addition
of a new officer, the associate
treasurer and business manager,
and for delineation of areas of
responsibility among personnei
within the office.

The Self-Study Committee
pointed out the weakness of the
faculty's present operations as a
deliberative body in faculty
meetings and recommended that
“serious study be given the sug-
gestion for the creation of a
‘Faculty Council to assume the
responsibilities, make the de-
cisions and exercise the legisla-
tive authority now invested in
the faculty as a whole.”

Further recommendations in-
cluded suggestions that the dean
of students be responsible for as-
signment of rooms and room-
mates to incoming freshmen and
for the selection of hall counsel-
ors.

A further suggestion was that
either the college or private
capital construct in the town
suitable lodging for visitors, and
that provision be made for wom-
en’s toilet facilities in fraternity
houses, separate from the house-
mothers’ apartments.

Overall, the body of the report
seems to present reasons ade-
quate to substantiate the re-
commendations for changes in
addition to providing an ade-
quate description of the present
organization and administration
of the college.

LUDWIG VON MISES
Still Keen-Minded At 90

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1965

Von Mises Discusses
: ‘Inflation, Price Rise

Forced to remain seated .dur-
ing his Tuesday chapel talk be-
cause of his advanced age,
economist Ludwig von Mises
talked candidly with the student
body about the problem of in-
flation.

One of the foremost neo-
classical economists in America
today, with teaching experience
at the Institute of International
Studies in Geneva, the Univer-
sity of Mexico and New York
University, the 90-year-old didn’t
say anything particularly new
or controversial, probably be-
cause of his realization that
many would not understand him
if he did.

The still keen-minded profes-
sor said inflation was “an in-
crease in the quantity of money.
resulting in a rise in prices.”
Today, the term is used to de-
scribe a general increase in

prices.

This is misleading, he said in
his heavy Austrian accent, for
it fostered the use of the phrase
‘inflationary pressures.’ There
are no such things, he held,

since spending will increase only
if money in the pockets does.

Von Mises described the two
ways the government has of
combating deficit spending: tax-
ation and an increase. in the
quantity of money. “Taxation
will not cause inflation but will
restrict expenditures.”

The second alternative will
cause inflation, since it will
“raise the income of some of the
people, causing a lift in their
buying power, which means a
lift in prices.” This hurts the
buyers who were not included
in the rise in income, and who
before were the market for. the
commodities.

Von Mises had a warning.
however: inflation was not fatal
to the United States in 1781.
he said, because the nation was
largely agricultural and could
provide for its own subsistance.

“Today, relations between men

are based on money, and any
breakdown in the currency sys-
tem could mean disaster for
all.”

ALSO OVERWORKED

fering with effective teaching
was the “hidden duties” of each
professor. These ‘‘hidden dut-
ies’ included clerical work (due
to a lack of secretarial help),
committee work -for the college,
handling material and equip-
ment (especially in the science
areas).

This work was sald to be tak-
ing too much time from the pre-
paration and research needed to
give the highest caliber instruc-
tion.

SALARIES

The area of faculty compensa-
tion includes both faculty sala-
ries and fringe benefits. The re-
cent salary increases of 1957-64
were commended for improving
the relative position of the
Davidson professor. But these
increases were termed insuffi-
cient because of very small in-
creases between 1951 and 1958.

Data released from the AAUP
for 1964-65 (824 institutions re-
porting) showed that Davidson
ranked ninth in the South among
all educational institutions in
average faculty salary and sixth
among liberal arts colleges.

The Self-Study Report conclud-
ed that Davidson. showed up
quite well in. faculty salaries in
the South, but could not. ‘‘com-
pete on even terms with the best
colleges . . . in the Northeast
and in the West.”

*eOcas

The average salary of the full
professor in 1964 was $11,500; as-
sociate professor, $9,663; assist-
ant professor, $8,032; instructor,
$6,625.

The.average salary for the en-
tire faculty was $9,730; this .is
nine-months salary and does not
include summer school salary
(which the committee deemed
inadequate).

FRINGE BENEFITS

The fringe benefits that David-
son offered to the average facul-
ty member, said the report, en-
abled the College to compare
favorably with any school in any
section of the country.

These fringe benefits include
retirement-annuity, hospital in-
surance, major medical insur-
ance, tuition exchange for facul-

.ty children, death benefits, sab-

batical leaves with full-or half-
salary and free admission to
athletic events at the college.

For all insurancé policies of
any kind sponsored in part by
the college, Davidson pays any-.
where from 10 per cent to 100
per cent of the premiums for
the professor and his family.
Most of this. coverage by the col-
lege is continued when the pro-
fessor or faculty member is on
sabbatical.

eligible for sabbatical leaves re-

absence.

The relatively small number
of men involved in sabbatical
leaves each year was in part at-
tributed to the inadequate salary
compensation for full-year
leaves of absence. The commit-
tee report recommended that
full salary be given to men on
one-year sabbaticals.

sor or associate professor has a

came from either Duke or Caro-

lina) and got his undergraduate.

degree from Davidson. The com-
mittee implies that this should
be changed in the not-too-distant
future by hiring men with more
varied backgrounds.

MODIFY THE OATH
The question of faculty quali-

Says Faculty Underpaid

fications are set out in the sec-
tion on faculty recruitment. The
report suggests that it would be
better to continue to modify the
faculty oath so that men with
more varied intellectual beliefs
could attain tenure at Davidson.

One of the proposals is that
a program of visiting professors
with non-Christian backgrounds
be established along with a pro-
gram of research instructorship.

This last program would help
acquaint Davidson student's
planning to go on to graduate
school with the nature and
methods of graduate level re-
search.
