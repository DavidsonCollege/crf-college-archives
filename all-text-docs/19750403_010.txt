Terry Howard gets off bench

as varied odds handed down

Thank you Terry Howard
wherever you are today, if you
haven’t committed suicide yet.
People reading this are
probably wondering who in the
hell is Terry Howard? How
soon they forget stars.

Terry Howard is hard to miss
on Louisville’s bench: Being the
only white on the squad, all
Terry did was to miss a free
throw that cost Louisville the
game with UCLA. He
definitely snatched defeat out
of the jaws of victory... °

Oh come on. Terry, cheer up;
it’s only the national cham-
pionship. Don’t worry, you'll
have another chance someday
to visit the championship,
although I’ve heard tickets are
hard to find.

Granted, Terry was thrown
under an inescapable spell’ by

_the greatest jinxster of all

time, Curt Gowdy, who said
“UCLA definitely fouled the
wrong guy there in Terry
Howard. Terry has made 28
consecutive free throws and is
shooting 100% at the line this
year.”’ i

Brick-gark, as Terry Howard
goes into the Gark Hall of
Fame along with other notables
such as Jim Marshall, Willie
Davis, and Mike Andrews.

Once again I say thank you,

My pre-season baseball
predictions have survived the
usual onslaught by Davidson’s
experts. I thought before cer-
tain players comeback or
retire, I ought to name my
over-rated all pro Baseball
Team: Wilbur Wood, Earl
Wiliams, Joe Torre, Ted
Sizemore, Chris Spier, Buddy
Bell, Willie Horton, Greg Luzin-
ski, and Rusty Staub.

(This last name takes the
cake as the Phillies are serious
about giving up Wayne Twit-
chell and Eddie Watt for the
Galloping Gourmet.)

AS baseball starts and all
other sports come to an end, I
may as well give the Freek’s fa-
vorites in the upcoming spring
classics. Pro Hockey sees all of
the following as legitimate con-
tenders for the Cup:
Philadelphia, Boston, Mon-
treal, and Buffalo.

Pro Basketball sees Boston
emerging over any and all op-
ponents. In the Masters, Jack
Nicklaus’ and Johnny Miller
should battle for the green coat
all the way. Longshots here are
Hale Irwin, John Mahaffey,
Tom Kite, and Bruce -Cramp-
ton.

An early Kentucky Derby
look sees Prince Thou Art as a
strong challenge to upset
Secretariat-compared Foolish
Pleasure. If Baeza rides, I like
the Prince coming on _ strong
in the stretch.

LATE BULLETIN

Longshot Ken ‘‘Salizar’’ Sch-
mader, with a_ beautiful
“chula” off the lower Cannon
wall, has narrowly won the
$25,000 Belk Handicap in
Frisbee-Jai-Lai over Rob
“‘Joie’’ Canning. Joie, on match
point, attempted a ‘“‘cordata”’
off the Watts wall, but failed as
the crowd of 72,307 cheered for
Salizar’s victory , the first in 13
years.

tickets may be cashed at win-
dows one and two. Off-track

ning tickets Mr. Slagle had?

Odds-on favorite Kirk
“Rufino” Combe couldn’t get
his game together, although he
slipped into third on a nice
“‘rebound”’ off the bushes. Here
