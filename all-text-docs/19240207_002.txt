Let's keep going.

The Wildkittens, playing their second cage
game of the season, and their first encounter
with a college quintet, swamped the Trinity
contenders in a game played at the gym last
Monday night. The final score was 28 to 14.

The Wildcats trimmed them then 45-26.

It was more football than basketball at |
times. Romefelt and Madison had a regular |
boxing bout in the bargain.

The Jax. papers say the Davidson game is
Florida's best chance for a victory. Some-
times we wonder,

IN FAVOR
THIS FALL

Short, threebutton,
half-belted ulsters

are to be greatly
favored this fall.
You’ll see many
of them; but none
like the Society

The difference is in
the cut. There’s an air
about this overcoat that
you will find nowhere
else; it’s smartly cut;
every detail—the roll of+
the lapel, the spacing of
the buttons, the placing
ofthe pockets-isexactly
right.

Carolina was a little off on her shots in
ithe Davidson game, but they made up for
lit by floor work and guarding.

A Carolina man after the game said: “We
\have met the enemy and they are ours.” We
jimagine they were rather glad it was over

If Ang. Lad can it means a big help in the

Dual meets with V. P. [L, V. M. 1, W. &

a chance for a go at Furman, with a couple
of state meets and you have a mouthful for
any team.

V. P. I. and probably Carolina will show
their speed on Richardson Field.

That new oval out there just looks like a
good track team on the sutface of things.

Coach Tilson is back to give the Wildcats
a taste of spring football.

Must be getting ready for that Lenoir

game next year.

Carolina beat V. M. I. State beat Clem-
son, Furman and Wofford, but lost to Geor-
gia and Mercer.

Elon beats V. P. I. and Carolina beat Elon
60-13. I imagine the Gobblers would like
to have Coach Monk back again.

Trinity licked State 35-23.
Carolina licked Trinity 31-20.
Trinity beat Wake Forest 26-22.

When Flake Laird got’ started against
Guilford he tied the old game up all by
himself. Keep up the good work, Flake.

It took Boggs and Sapp to stop the Fraz-

WRESTLING TEAM MEETS
CAROLINA SATURDAY |

Davidson will have its first intercollegiate |
wrestling match of this season Saturday |
night when Coach Weems’ grapplers meet
the Carolina squad on the home square. This
week has seen extra training for the Red |
and Black grapplers and everything is set to
give Carolina a trimming.

This will be Davidson’s second meet,
whereas the Carolina wrestlers will have the
advantage of what they have learned in a
number of matches. They have just re-
turned from a Virginia trip, where they de-
feated the University, tied V. P. L., lost to
Washington and Lee on one point, and were
beaten by V. M. I. 13 to 5. They will come
to Davidson after meeting the Concord “Y,”
which Davidson swamped 21 te 0, in Con-
cord, the night before.

used the five-man defense, the Davidson team
working it to better advantage. The Trinity '
team ineffectively tried the long route to the |
basket, while the Wildcats used passes in |
getting it under the goal for short shots.

For Trinity, Bagg registered half of their |
points, while Anderson, with 11 counters to|
his credit, and Sapp, with 10, accounted for
the larger part of Davidson’s total.

A good bit of interest is being developed
