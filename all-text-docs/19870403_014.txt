Board of Trustees divulges large real estate holdings

By TOOM UCHLAND

Media Distortion Czar Bob
Page, of the college’s Office of
Propaganda, says that inquiries
have been flowing in “fast and
furious” since Tuesday's David-
son College Trustee disclosure of
many previously secret college
realestate holdings. —_

Last week’s . Mecklenburg
County circuit court decision
forced the Trustees to make the
statement. Many college officials
are frankly astonished at the ex-
tent of the properties involved.
“Frankly, I’m astonished at the
extent of the properties involved,”
said Vice President for Develop-
ment John Griffith. “No, really, I
am.” '

Perhaps one of the most inter-

esting parcels of land in the hold-
ings is the Malibu home of actor
William Shatner of TV’s “Star
Trek.” The 120-acre estate was
purchased in early 1985 for $3.5
million as a retirement perk for
Davidson President John Kuyken-
dall, who had been considering
leaving the college for a second
career in television evangelism.
Kuykendall proved hostile
when approached for comment.
“Don’t think I’ve just got this

thing set on ‘stun,’ boy,” he-

shrieked early Thursday morning
in his office while perched on his
desk. “Dammit, Missy, beam me

‘up!” he added, snarling into one of

the two staplers he held.
Another item on the 534-page
list is a plot of land adjacent to

Lenin’s Tomb in Moscow. “This
parcel was due for disclosure,
anyway,” noted friendly and out-
going Trustee John Belk. “The
Trustees have decided it is in the
best interest of the college to
develop: it as a college-owned
franchise of Spencer's Gifts. They
make a lot of money,” he
explained, “arid we needed an out-
let to dispose of the Khrushchev
dartboards,” thousands of which
were produced for an ill-fated
1960s college fundraiser. “Not to
mention the need to tap the grow-
ing market for Chernobyl table
cigarette lighters and Gorbachev
signature edible panties.”

The Soviet Embassy in
Washington could not be reached

Divestment investigation

By DEE BATE
To deal with the issue of South
African investments, the David-
son College Board of Trustees re-
leased a 15-year plan earlier today
during which specifically as-

signed committees will investi- °

gate all possibilities.

“We felt that, uh, as things
stand, the college is, uh, torn
apart, uh, on this issue,” one
board member said. “Maybe in 15
years, uh, the whole thing will,
uh, be resolved.”

The board outlined the duties
for 15 committees, all of which
will be studying different aspects
ofthe issue. Each year, the board
said, trustees will participate in a
show-and-tell period in which that
year’s committee can relate its
findings.

“I think the show-and-tell idea

is ingenious,” one member said..
“We get really bored just talking
and listening to everyone else dur-
ing those meetings, and having
pictures and visual demonstra-
tions will just be really neat.”

The board related that the gen-
eral consensus amongst its mem-
bers is one of horror at the system
of apartheid currently in place in
South Africa. ,

“My wife is just aghast at the
news every night,” one member
said.

“It’s bad. It’s just really bad,”
said another.

“I bet there are pinko commies
involved,” said a third.

The board has anticipated the
return of shanties to the grounds

‘between the Martin Chemistry

Building and the Grey Student

Union and expects them to remain
on campus for the | 5year period.
“The housing office was

called in on this problem,” one

_member said, “and we decided

that in the room lottery during the
spring, we’re going to have a spe-
cial section for mega-liberals who
will participate in the lottery to
live in the shanties the following
year. We’re hoping this will solve
the problem with a shortage in
housing.”

One member, who asked to re-
main anonymous, said he vehe-
mently disagrees with the propo-
sal that was accepted.

“T thought we should start in-
vesting exclusively in South Afri-
can companies, just to get back at
those crudball liberals, and plus,
that’s, uh, jin the best interest of
the college, I think, yeah.”

cials were also unavailable, as
they were occupied with digging
out a bunker in the White House
front yard. “A bunker? Gee, I
think it’s actually a new garden,”
lied President Reagan through an
interpreter.

The most valuable item in the
report was the courtyard of the
Pentagon building in Virginia.
Valued at $34.5 million and
leased by the ROTC department to
the Cuban government, it was the
site of the 1985 spring break trip
for Davidson ROTC cadets.

During their three-day stay,
cadets painted a series of alternat-
ing black and white concentric cir-

cles onto the property at the re-

quest of the Cubans. When
pressed for an explanation, ROTC

student commander and Charlotte
Observer coverboy John McNeill
said, “Hey, I don’t know why they
asked us to do that. What I do
know is that we do as we're told.”

Student reaction. to the once-
secret holdings was overwhelm-
ingly one-sided. A Davidphonian
survey shows that a whopping 85
percent of students agree that the
Trustees should have made the
disclosures sooner. Of those who
do not whop, 95 percent agreed.

Few students were willing to
be quoted directly, perhaps in
reaction to last week’s disclosure
of Dean of Students Will Terry’s
well-armed secret police force.
“I'll take a, I mean the, fifth,
thank you,” said one freshman as
he reached for his flask.

Militaristic fanfare heralds Trustee’s descision to study

South African investments further
