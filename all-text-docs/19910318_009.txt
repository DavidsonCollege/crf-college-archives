5:00 P.M. SPRING BREAK BEGINS!!!

The staff of The Davidsonian, tired and in desperate
need of a rest from this nonsense, is taking a little break.
We'll be back on April 8, so get all those letters you've
been meaning to write ready for that issue. We'll be
putting out our last serious issue on the 15th, and then
The Davidphonian will be released on April 29, just in
time for exams. Have a great Spring Break!

Use Your Smarts Under The Sun

By Jennie Wagner

Spring Break is just around the
comer and next week most of us
will be headed for the beach in
search of that “deep, dark, tropical
tan”. Despite all the warnings of
skin cancer, everyone usually goes
out on the first day and gets fried.
Even if you try to achieve that
“healthy” tan by gradually tanning
without burning, itcan still be dan-
gerous. |

According to MacLean’s
magazine, doctors say that people
who go outdoors for short periods
of intense sun exposure on the
weekends or during vacations in-
crease their risk of melanoma.
Malignant melanoma appears as
irregular shaped moles, and if it
goes unchecked it can spread to

other organs.

‘Because fair-skinned people
have smaller amounts of melanin
in their skin they stand a greater
risk of developing skin cancer and
wrinkles than do those individuals
with darker complexions. Melanin
is the skin’s natural protector

against ultraviolet rays; and, when
we tan, the pigment melanin ab-
sorbs UV rays and darkens the
skin.

The safest way to protect your
skin this spring break is to invest in
a bottle of sunscreen that blocks
out UV-A and UV-B radiation.
Most ‘sunscreens block out the
shorter wavelength UV-B rays that
cause sunburn and some forms of
cancer. UV-A rays, which were at
one time thought to be harmless,
are longer and penetrate deeper
into the skin promoting wrinkled,
splotchy skin as well as cancer.

Business Week magazine
warns the consumer not to be
misled by skin-care products that
advertise UV-A protection because
the FDA has not yet set a standard
for measuring those products. The
only product that has been ap-
proved by the FDA for coverage
against UV-A rays is “Photoplex”,
from Allergan Inc.Some products
lead the consumer to believe that
they arereceiving a greater amount
of UV-A protection than they ac-

NC Dance Theater Offers

By Cecily Craighill
‘The North Carolina Dance
Theatre performed in Love Audi-
torium on Wednesday, March 13,
as the last offering of this year’s

’ Artists Series. For those of you

who were there, congratulations,
and for those of you who were not,
I’m sorry.

You missed an exquisite eve-

- ning of music, lights costumes,

and extremely creative ballet.
Those who joined me in watching
the performance will agree, I’m

sure, that this regional ballet com-
pany based in Winston-Salem is
first-rate.

I say thisiwith some authority,
too, having seen some of the best
dance companies that America has
to offer. Perhaps the Joffrey or the
American Ballet Theatre have more
money and more stars, but the only
other company I have seen that had
theenergy, humor, and athleticism
of the NC Dance Theatre was
Twyla Tharp:

' The simplicity of the sets and the

costumes, the creative lighting
design, and the,variety of music all
served to frame and highlight the
talentofthe dancers. The first piece,

. Brandenburg Concerto #3 ,wasa
_ group of three dances that incorpo-

rated balloons and the backdrop of
doors into them.

The precise and athletic move-
ments of the dancers provided an
interesting counterpoint to the for-

- mality of Bach’s music. It is re-

freshing to see dancers approach
traditional forms with wit and
modernity. .

The second piece was the weak-
est from my point of view. Glinka
Pas de Trois_had two women and
one man performing a more tradi-
tional ballet dance.

The man, Patrick Badua, had
some impressive solos, and the
overall impression was good, es-
pecially the technical aspects, but I
just didn’t feel that it was as excit-
ing as the other pieces they did.

The third piece they performed
was The Afternoon of a Faun, with

- music by Debussy. I remember

most vividly from the company’s

last visit here two years ago anther *
|. Debussy piece they did - La Mer.
In that production they made water

and the sea, mimicked by the fluid-

‘ity and grace of the dancers. That

grace and fluidity was apparent
once again, but with an added

The faun was danced by Mel A.
Tomlinson, a man who had not an
ounce of body-faton him, and who

tually are.

Another thing the consumer
needs to keep in mind is that der-
matologists have determined thata
sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 is
enough protection for a day in the
sun.

Don’t get enticed into buying
sunscreens higher than SPF-15
thinking that you are receiving
maximum protection. Although the

" productis blocking out UV-B rays

which cause sunbum, you may be
getting burned by the deeper pene-
trating UV-A rays.

Protect your skin this spring
break because the effects of the
sun are lethal and irreversible. It
would not be realistic to stay
completely out of the sun; how-
ever, use your head and take the

‘ appropriate precautions when out

on the beach,

This has been a friendly re-
minder on behalf of the SHOC
(Student Health Options and Con-
cerns) committee.

Have a good spring break!

Performance Of Grace And Fluidity

also had some of the most amaz-
ingly controlled movements I have
ever seen. The contrast or his height
and dark skin against the four:
maidens dressed in diaphanous —
white helped to emphasize the
innocence|and sexual awakening
taking place in the woods that af-
ternoon. It was brilliantly per-
formed, I thought, not something
that could be surpassed that eve-
ning.

The final piece, Clowns and Oth-
ers, may not have surpassed it, but
it certainly managed to equal it, if
in a different style. The entire
ensemble was dressed in white
clown suits with metallic accents.
The company made the best use of .
creative lighting in this piece, rely-
ing on color to create certain ef-
fects.

There was more acting in this
piece than the others, and some
very funny moments, such as the
short man trying to kiss the tall
woman and just hitting her cleav-
age, or the bratty little girl licking
her lollipop and sticking it to the
face of another clown. The clown
walking on the tightrope, half in
purple light, half in green, was
especially effective.

I would heartily recommend that
anyone who has notseen this dance
company or who has never seen a
dance company at all attend one of
their performances. the energy in
the dancers is infectious, and their
dancing is very accessible to people
of all ages and backgrounds.

It seemed to me that a large por-
tion of the audience was older or.
from off-campus, and this saddens

We are getting top-quality
cultural events here oncampus (and

_ tickets at a bargain price), yet very

few people seem to take advantage
of it.

Once again, to those people
who didn’t go, I’m sorry, you
missed a great show. I hope you
have the opportunity to see them
sometime.
