A series of four speakers on the conflicts in
the Middle East features the Rev. Dr. Fahed
Abu-Akel, the first native Arab moderator of
the Presbyterian Church, USA (PCUSA), this
Monday evening in Tyler-Tallman Hall at 7:30.

Rev. Abu-Akel’s visit and this week’s series,
sponsored jointly by Davidson College Pres-
byterian Church and Davidson College, begin
an extended look on campus at the perennial
conflicts grounded in the Middle East.

However the series identifies social groups
usually unnoticed by the media who are in-
volved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in-
cluding Palestinian Christians and members of
the Israeli military against the occupation of
Palestinian territories.

Last night Rabbi Jeremy Barrias, adjunct
Davidson chaplain and Associate Rabbi of
Temple Bethel, spoke about the Israeli-Pales-
tinian conflict from the perspective of a Re-
formed Jewish-American. .

Tonight Major Stav Adivi of the Israeli mili-
tary will share his views on Israeli treatment of
the Palestinians.

Adivi grew up in Israel, has served in the
Israeli army for the last 27 years (since 18 years
of age), and is a self-identified Zionist.

He is also one of the highest ranking officers
among over 500 Israeli soldiers who have re-
fused to serve in the occupied territories and
have joined the organization Ometz L’Sarev
(Courage to Refuse).

Next Wednesday former Ambassador Jack

Perry will sift through the major issues in the
broader context of the entire Middle East. Am-
bassador Perry was the first director of
Davidson’s Dean Rusk programs.

The series highlights Rev. Dr. Fahed Abu=
Akel, a Palestinian Christian and former mod-
erator of the
PCUSA.

Born in Palestine
in 1944, before the
declaration of Israeli
statehood, Fahed
Abu-Akel’s family
(except his mother)
left their home to
avoid harm during
the Israeli war of in-
dependence.

He came to the
United States at age
22 for formal educa-
tion, attending col-
lege and seminary
and eventually get-
ting his Doctorate of
Ministry from
McCormick Theo-
logical seminary.

Church USA is the DCPC services.
