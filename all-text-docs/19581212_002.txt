Curriculum Enrichment Needed

Approximately one-half of the 124
semester hours required for a David-
son bachelor’s degree is taken up by
required courses, with eight hours for
ROTC and the remaining forty-five
per cent for academic subjects. The
purpose of these heavy requirements
is to provide the basic rudiments of
a liberal education: as the Catalogue
puts it, the educational aim of the
school is “‘to impart to its students a
knowledge of the forces which have
determined the pattern of our civili-
zation."

It is obvious that any plan for gen-
eral education which seeks to fulfill
such a sweeping purpose can never
be perfect or final, and that changes
will be necessary from time to time.
in order to keep pace with new de-
velopments in the disciplines taught
and to embody new methods of teach-
ing them. Several such changes —
definitely for the better — have been
made at Davidson in the last three

years — in the departments of Bible.
mathematics and English.

All the departments and individ-
uals responsible for these changes de-
serve a good deal of praise. The new
offerings have helped to make the
first two years at Davidson more
meaningful for those who have been
able to benefit by them. On the nega-
live side, they have eliminated fea-
tures of the old required courses in
these departments which, for some
individuals at least, have proved to
be quite dull and deadening. These
changes were motivated by a realistic
appraisal of the bad features of the
old system, along with a willingness
to experiment with improvements.
Such an attitude must be shared by
the entire faculty if very much can
be done about improving the quality
of education here.

Much, however, remains to be
done. We would like to sketch brief-
ly what we consider to be a feasible
program of tightening up the required
curriculum.

The present basic requirements in
mathematics, history, and sophomore
English would be retained. In other
departments the following changes
would be made:

The Bible requirement would be
reduced to six hours, which could
be satisfied by the present courses or
by new courses in comparative re-
ligion.

The present humanities course
would be expanded to include a much
larger percentage of the freshman
class, perhaps as high as one-fourth
or one-third, instead of the single
small section now taught.

The language requirement would
be changed from the present one of
twelve hours (beginning at the 11-12
level or higher). Instead, each stu-
dent would have to have a reading
knowledge of a foreign language, to
be satisfied in one of the following
ways. three years of a language, be-
ginning at the 11-12 level; two years,
beginning at the 21-22 level; one year
at the 31-32 level; or a satisfactory
score on a reading test given by the
department. ,

A Social science requirement
would be added, consisting of six
hours in political science, economics,
psychology, or seciology.

The natural science requirement
would be changed from the present
eight-hour survey course at the 11-12
level in physics, biology, or chemistry.
In its place would be put a “liberal
arts” science course designed for non-
science students. Such a course would
include work in the laboratory, but
its scope would not be limited to any
one of the sciences, and its purpose
would be to lead to an understand-
ing of the basic methods of science,
rather than to prepare for further
technical training.

The DAVIDSONIAN feels that
changes along these lines are feasible
for the immediate future.

We Must Re-study Bidding Change

IFC President Vernon Anderson.
in last week's DAVIDSONIAN staff in-
terview, expressed his intention of
bringing the matter of preferential
bidding before the student body again
this winter.

The main purpose of a preferen-
tial bidding system is limiting the
size of individual fraternities. This
limitation has both tangible benefits
“nd intangible ones. It would be fool-
ity to let houses On oui new iraternity

I.M.4%.C. Reforms

An organization that has taken
great strides but has received little
recognition this year is now due for
a word of. commendation. The Intra-
mural Athletic Council. under the

leadership of President Ralph Wilson,

has perhaps benefited from relative
lack of publicity. As an infant organi-
zation, it has encountered its share of
difficulties and is just now beginning
to settle into a concrete framework.
Briefly, the Council as a group
representing all sides of fraternity
and Independent life on the campus
has taken over the man-sized task of
supervising the interfraternity sports
program, a_ responsibility formerly
shouldered singly by Coach Whittle.
By virtue of its varied representation
the Council at once can view a prob-

its charter.

The subject was widely discussed’
and debated last year. A majority of
upperclassmen today probably under-
Stand the basic changes such a plan
would necessitate and realize the ad-
vantages it holds over the present sys-
tem and yet rejected preferential bid-
ding mainly because it was an inno-
vation.

Certainly this is the most :import-
ant issue confronting our fraternity
system today. one with whieh all
"should be seriously concerned. There-
fore..we hope that under the leader-
ship of the IFC, all misunderstandings
cl how z preferential bidding system
works witl be clarified and that the
prooosal will reach onactment in the.
near future.—S.B.L.

lem as it affects all the fraternities.

In. the. line of accomplishment, to
name a few, the Council has intro-
duecd much-needed reforms in the
refereeing situation; it has stream-
lined the sports calendar by dropping
table tennis, a sport which attracted
little interest in interfraternity com-
petition, and by elevating volleyball,
definitely a team sport, to major
status; the council is, in general,
studying and updating all intramural
rules.

Although there are still a number
of knofty problems to be ironed out,
the 1958-1959 IMAC is to be com-
mended for the sure foundation it is
laying for future Councils, and for
action lending to a better interfratern-
ity athletic program.—G.W.R.

COMMITTEEMAN WRITES

Responsibility Of Student Elections Committee Lies
Bsyord Mere Study; Leadership And Action Needed

By ERVIN DUGGAN

The Student Council in com-
missioning an elections commit-
tee to “study elections proce-
dures as they presently exist at
Davidson College” dropped into
the committee’s lap a bundle of
problems both challenging and
bewildering.

Committee deliberations have
centered consistently on three
major problems: (1) slow. inef-
ficient, and bulky election pro-
cedure; (2) lack of a free at-
mosphere for exchange of opin-
ions between candidates and
students-at-large. and (3) stu-
dent indifference,: probably
born of the first two problems.

GROUPING

Apparently the most attrac-
tive alternative discussed by the
group concerning the first issue
is that of “blocking” elections
into groups. YMCA offices.
cheerleader, athletic council
and publications, for instance,
might be grouped.

Class officers might be chos-
en in the election of student
council: representatives. with
highest vote-getters receiving
highest class offices — a not-

streamlining elections
dure.
OPEN POLITICS?

The second difficulty — lack
of opportunity for presentation
of ideas—has brought forth a
variety of opinions.

The “radical reformers" of
the committee advocate a wide-
open elections system with fre-
quent. debate and discussion
from candidates. Campaigning
would be sanctioned within cer-
tain bounds and a system more
closely resembling a university
political apparatus would be in-
stituted.

Others support the present
practice of prohibiting open
campaigning, advocating freer
use of campus newspaper
space, union forums, and
chapel addresses to open the
“idea-atmosphere.” The open
atmosphere can be created,
they feol, without risking the
abuses of machine politics,
bloc voting and “ballyhoo”’
campaigning now prohibited
at Davidson.

A solution to these first two
problems, members feel, would
best solve the third — that of

proce-

too-radical change from present student indifference. A stream-

procedure.
Less sweeping
such as relocating and rescher-

lining of procedure and more
alterations student-candidate
ideas should revive student con-

interplay of

OBSERVATIONS

Two observations at this point
are perhaps appropriate:

First of all, it seems clear
that, while change is certainly
needed, complete reorganization
is neither needed or desired.
The defeat year before last of
the Peden amendment, which
called for wide-open elections
with unrestrained campaigning
and bloc voting (if such would
occur), offers a pertinent re-
minder that students value in-
telligent concern over excite-
ment, quiet consideration of
fact over loud and unrestrained
electioneering.

The committee can play its
most effective role in improv-
ing procedure based on the
present recognition that  indi-
vidual campaigning, bloc voting
and political expenditure invite
abuse.

The problem as seen by
this writer is to minimize the
difficulties of the present
system and to encourage a
more intelligent approach to
elections; it is not to usher
in a new order where diffi-
culties are more tikely and
the chance for an intelligent
approach all but negated by
sound and fury.

Secondly, there is danger of

Dear Editor: <-

We quite agrée with the dis-
taste "oF CIC. for censorship
al books and periodicals on con.

troversial «questions, whether
they be conc’rned with cg¢o-
nomics. rel’ion. sex or soci-
ology.

That was never the purpose
f the Permanent Reserve. The
trutn is that the Permanent Re-
serve was established for the
opposite purpose: in order that
controversial material could be
available.

The sad truth is that many
of the items in this section were
put there after three or four
copies of the same had disap-
peared from the_ reguar
shelves. According to our rec-
ords five copies of Helena
Wright “Sex in Marriage”
walked out of the library before
we put the title on Permanent
Reserve. Roberts “Rules of Or-
der” is in this section for the
same reason. It could hardly be
considered subversive.

As C.H.C. observed some of
the very old volumes are there
as a matter of preservation. We
hope eventually to have a Treas-
ure Room where these can be

kept. They will, of course, be

Dear Editor:

Because of athletic scholar-
ships many fine young men are
able to get an education who
otherwise couldn't afford it.
This. is the sentimental palaver
we hear in defense of the sacred
squandrance often falsely catled
“athletic scholarships.”

Did anyone else notice in a
previous DAVIDSONIAN that
we give away (or spend) more
money for athletic grants than
we allocate for either grant-in-
aids or for regular genuine
scholarships, Did anyone notice
further that this type of grant
is one of the two which are
not based on. financial need?
The other, to Presbyterian
ministers’ sons, is obviously a
social obligation (not given for
ethical or religious reasons).

So -"c excuse. ourselves by

why de we do that? In order to
establish our i:eputation, as a
colicge? Bevause:we necd recog-
nition in the fletd of athletics
because we cannot earn it in
other areas?

I should hope these are not
rensons that apply to Davidson.
Ilias anyone considered follow-
ing the intelligent example set
by a school similar in many
ways, Washington and Lee, and
withdras int from the Southern
Conference?

The sentimentalists drone on:
Shouldn't a person be recog-
nized for excellence in any
ability other than book-learn-
ing? I agree; it's an excellent
idea, but why pick athletics ex-
clusively, even to the point of
buying players with fixed sums?

Shouldn't a musician, drama-
tist. debater. creative writer. or
so on also receive financial aid
when needed? Ambitious stu-
dents are active in these areas
already but some of the bless-
ings the Trustees have seen fit
to shower on sports wouldn't
hurt such organizations or the
reputation Davidson likes to re-
vei in. Tim Ray

of student indifference.
course it is important to make
the polls accessible and to
stress vital issues so that i

est will be quickened.

But with changes in s
must come a change in
student attitude.

Perhaps the committee 1 -
{ind it desirable to go beyond
recommending that elections
procedures be made merely con-
venient. The group, after its
report is submitted and its de-
liberative work completed,
could be an instrument for. en-
couraging and actively promot-
ing interest.

The Elections Board serves no
such function, busy as it is with

mechanics: the elections com:
mittee might exert positive
leadership beyond the bounds
-f olanning; it could and should
actively to ensure that im-
ments in clection proce-
would result in increased
icipation by students.
CHANGE AND ACTION
Change is not enough; energy
and activity to make change ef-
fective are of great importance.
If the student council and the
student body accept the recom-
mendations of the committee,
the committee’s work is not
complete. The task remains to
see that not only mechanical
changes but changes in attitude
and action are made.

What's So Funny? °
Nothing At All...

By JOHN TOUMARAS
“What's so damn funny?” Nothing. Nothing at all,
really. Nothing at all.

Monday night we’ll feed the children, entertain them,
and then present them with gifts. There'll be carol sing-
ing, story-telling, and the usual oooh’s and ah’s at the
lighting of the Christmas tree and at Santa’s arrival. Of
course we'll have to help them unwrap their presents and
make preliminary inspections and tests. And when it’s
ali over, we'll feel a warm glow in our tweed-covered
hearts, and we'll remember that surely it’s much better

to give than to receive.

Wednesday’s Observer carried a news story relating
the “mixed reaction” to a report made by a field repre-,’
sentative of the National Student Association that Wo-
man’s College, a part of the University of North Caro-
lina, was “intellectually dead.” Franklin McNutt, Dean
Emeritus of the Graduate School, replied that the charge
was “nonsense.” The report also went on fo state that
“there is a lack of interest in major topics” and that the
students “don’t dare discuss race relations.” Could we,
too, make an answer of “nonsense” to such a charge?

All of you who have opinions concerning the elections
system, please come te the meetings of the Elections Com-
mittee and air your views. And if you find that you can’t
attend, talk with one of the committee members. Here -
is your opportunity to make a practical. personal, intel-
lectual, non-monetary contribution to Davidson.

Next Wednesday night there will be a public read-
ing by students of Archibald McLiesh’s “J. B.” at the
Union. A serious religious drama about Job, the play
contains relevant thoughts about our contemporary cul-
ture. Let’s fill up the ballroom.

Don’t forget. Make an effort. Give to the Gift Fund.

success in the past, upon the
relative need of ‘the recipient

on the possibility of sacri-
ficing a week’s stud, on the
benoficial effects of tithing.
There may be a further
thought.

Two thousand years ago a
Jewish widow softly stole to
the Church treasury with two
lowly mites, and herself, to
give, Her substance was not
great, unless one includes her
person in her substance; and
her lack of substance limited
her freedom, unless she were
free to contribute herself. The
grandeur of her action was the
result of her inclusion of her-
self within it.

She did not consider herself
the possessor of anything, and
felt constrained to do what she
did; she would have said that
none was good but God alone,
and that she could thus do no
other. Hers was the greatest,
the only real, stewardship.

The gift without the giver is
bare. The blessedness of giv-
ing refers more to the giver
than the gift unless the gift be
the giver.
