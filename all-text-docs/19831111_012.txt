SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 13

WDAV RADIOTHON: All Day. Looks like this is the
only thing at all today. Morrison Room.
FLASHDANCE UPDATE:
SGA PRE-EXAM SUICIDE PARTY: Commons. 9-
IL p.m. Freshmen and hall counselors only. We're not
sure what this actually entails, but they'll probably block
off the balconies and refuse to serve food in order to
guarantee safety. Who knows, they may even
flashdance at this thing.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 14
CLASSES END: 5 p.m.
JUGGLING: All of them, victims of their own pro-
vocative beauty. Morrison Room. 7 p.m.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15
READING DAY: With a day like this, it’s easier to dis-
card the entire concept of reading in favor of an inexpen-
sive novel and BHA & BHT-filled chocolate-flavored
dessert items. We’re talking Harlequins and Hostess.
TURKEY SHOOT: Come blast away with the ROTC’s
in the basement Belk rifle range. Blam! There goes one
under the ice machine. Zowie/ Get that one in the corner!
Take a study break and bring a turkey home to Mom, or
Dad even. 9:00 to 3:00. ¢75.

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16
EXAMS BEGIN: 9 a.m. Good luck with exams! And
have a safe but fun Thanksgiving break!

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 17

EXAMS: Sounds suspiciously like exhumes.

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 18
MORE EXAMS. EXAMS GALORE.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER
LAST CHANCE TO TAKE THOSE EXAMS
PERFECT ATTENDANCE: Gold stars to everyone
attending exams! (afterall, you’re students!).

SHORT CALENDAR: But that doesn’t mean we aren't
doing anything!
