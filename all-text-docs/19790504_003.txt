To the Editor: -

Everything is peachy-keen
here at Davidson College, no?
Spring is in the air, graduation
is right around the corner; here
in this quaint community stu-
dents are gleefully rushing a-
round, happy about life, classes
and the beginnings of their sun
tans, big dates and summer
flings. Right?

Wrong! In the past few
weeks, this campus has been
rocked by rather interesting
events. This is only one adjec-
tive I could utilize... The others
range in degree from cute, to
downright obscene.

,, As you have guessed, I am
referring to the publishing. of
the unique ‘‘Guide to Courses”
and the brief and bewildering
visit by Canon Carr. But I am
not sitting down at this ma-
chine to make more comments
about the above incidents, or
add my own kindling to the fires
which will probably be burning
for several months.

No, I prefer to offer some
outside comments about the
community that has been
through these events and offer
you all some insight about what
is making you all tick. I choose
this time for two reasons. The
first is that the mood has been a
bit tense in the past few weeks,
and a lot of people have been
going around questioning them-
selves and many aspects of this
school. I realize that this
sounds like I am too sensitive to
the situation, but this leads up
to my second point. This is my
first term at Davidson. I feel I
have been here long enough to
pick up a basic understanding;
yet, I am still a bit new to the
scene.

So, I shall speak my piece,
but before I get to the glamour,
glitter, and backslapping, let
me tell you where I am coming
from.

I transferred here from two
institutions, more or less. The
first was the University of
Vermont, where I studied (?)
1% years. The second was a

Spanish university I attended
through an American program,
until January of this year. I
faund out about Davidson when
I was on your spring term in
Spain just one year ago.

The fact that I am here says
that I wasn't too happy with
my earlier situations: Well, yes
and: no... of course, I loved
Vermont, and Spanish wine
cannot be beaten. But I per-
ceived that Davidson was a

to finish my education there.
And just what do I mean by

dynamic community? Well, for

starters, let’s talk about the

the ones sitting there reading
this. You are one incredible
group of people. Intelligent,
motivated, friendly, and a good
mixture of opposites. This is to
say that there are enough book
worms to keep the library full,
and enough party people to
keep the beer flowing. An
exaggeration? I think not.

Yes, I know that northerners
are different, and yet I know it

is spring term, but this has been »

my impression. (Try striking up
a casual conversation in Ver-
mont when it is -40, as you walk
to class.)

Ay yes, the faculty... My,
they certainly have been in the
press recently... But, look,
guys, there is an esprit de corps
here that doesn’t exist any-
where. Try going over to a
Spanish teacher’s house for a
cup of coffee or asking for extra
help. You'll get a long stare (or
for that matter, try finding a
teacher's house in Vermont). I
don’t mean to say that they're
all ogres, but the teachers here
take great pride in their work
and have a much greater inter-
est in you, students. Heck, I
can remember one poor guy who
lost credit in a course because
his teacher swore he hadn’t
turned in the computer print
out card with 16 different I.D.
numbers and therefore wasn't in
the class.

As for the staff: gee, but its
nice to have a maid on your
floor who doesn’t greet you with
a stony stare, or a librarian who
doesn’t look TOO bored with
your research topic. And there
are actually administrators who
will help with crises, like ar-
ranging your schedule so you
have lots of beach time, or
making payments in time for
last year just in time to start
over for the following one. We
are surrounded here by people
who want to help you and their
enthusiasm rubs off.

There are obviously some

. exceptions. People tend to steal

at times, even though we have
an honor code, and there’s
always a teacher who looks like
he'll bite your head off. And no
student is friendly and receptive
when you have your stereo on at
4 a.m. But we are only human
Therefore, we make mistakes,
and the things we run or have

‘created tend. to follow us in our

downward slide sometimes.
Final point about the physi-

cal plant... Your dorm.room

may be way too small for a

roomie, pot plant and 116 |

albums but has a bed, and
there is hot water for showers
and waterfights. Dana may
have miserable desks, but at
least you -have a place to sit,
and don’t have to stand through
a physics lecture: And thank
the Lord you don't have to ride
a small city bus for twenty
minutes to get to classes or
walk twenty minutes from dorm
to class room.

Still not convinced? Take a

look at the basic commodity,
T.P. (Bathroom tissue}. This is
a nicety that doesn’t exist in a
spanish public restroom, and
what you have in your home is

note... To all students, faculty,
staff and even the Chamber-
maids: you deserve every word
of praise that I have given you
in this and a lot more. Now, you
can finish this issue, go off into
your little life, and complain
about Dr. So and So’s class, the
mess at registration, the room-
ie’s stereo, or the honor code
that won't let you cry with a
friend about an exam. Or you
can look at the whole scene
through the eyes of a student,
who is still trying to remember
her English and forget 12 ft.
snow drifts. If you can do that,
you will see some very positive
aspects to this community.

This perspective will show
you my. whole purpose for
writing this letter, and perhaps
you'll come to appreciate even
more what I have just come to
know. ;

To the Editor:

Davidson has recently re=
ceived much publicity regarding
the incident concerning Burgess
Carr. An editorial in the
Charlotte Observer expressed
the view that hopefully we could
all learn something from a
mistake such as this. Apparent-
ly, Davidson has_ learned
nothing.

This weekend, one week after
Carr walked off this campus,
because of the lack of sensi-
tivity exhibited here, a large
number of students will be
celebrating Old South.

They will be celebrating a
time in our past which closely
resembles the present day con-
ditions of apartheid in South
Africa.

_Granted, for some, Old South
means the days of chivalry,
gentility, charm, grace, and
luxury; but for others it signi-
fies only poverty, oppression,
and exploitation.

Just as the former conditions
of the old South could not exist
without the latter, so a celebra-
tion of these former conditions
cannot exist without inherently
comprehending a celebration of
the latter.

The time has come to stop
lying to ourselves. Ignorance
and lack of awareness can no
longer be used as excuses for
bigotry.

We, as students, as youth, as
the new generation, have the
choice of continuing to commit
the same errors as those around
us, or of learning from their
mistakes and thereby making
ourselves a little more under-
standing and a little more
human.

‘For any generation of any era
—past, present, or future—
the celebration and consequent
perpetuation of .a way of life
that promotes inequality and
injustice is inexcusable.

False Security?

The girls who were ac-
costed last Wednesday
night should be commend-
ed for reporting the inci-
dent to the police. This is
not the first time Davidson
students have been harass-
ed. Since no such disturb-
ance had previously been
reported, the attitude de-
veloped that everything
was secure. Girls have
almost no fear of. being
attacked on the Davidson
campus, especially when
compared to girls at larger
colleges. Perhaps we
Should be a little more
cautious from now on.

The. police are under fire
for being too nonchalant
about the reports, but it is
easy to see how they too
can develop a feeling of
false security. Davidson is
a relaxed and relatively
crimeless community. The
attitude that nothing bad
ever happens here can per-
meate thé police depart-
ment also. Since nothing is

mishandling
of the incident last week. it

is the responsiblity of the
dispatcher to ascertain the

details of the attack by

questioning the caiter.

that she is being harassed

ware of the seriousness of
the disturbance and pro-
bably acted properly under
such circumstances. -

The community should
be careful, however, not to
overreact to this incident.
The police are on the job,
and the attack should serve ‘
well to increase their vigi-
lance. The more disturb-
ances that are reported, the
fewer that will occur. It is
hoped that any further at-
tacks can be prevented.
