Dr. Ogden Speaks On
“A High Way and a Low”

On Monday evening Dr. Ogden spoke to
the students on the subject, “A High Way
and a Low.”

“Every man must make the choicé,”
said,

he
In every man’s life there comes a time

in which he must choose the road which he _

will follow. There is a high road and a low.
Some men follow the high one, others follow
the low one, and in the misty plains between
the crowds float around, drifting to and fro.

The speaker chose his text from the 13th
chapter of Deuteronomy, “Therefore choose
life.”

A great physician once said that he
thought the Bible was a good book, because
it showed that man was feeling after God.
“That's just what it isn’t,” said the speaker.
“This Book is God’s feeling after man.”

There is one great way. In one direction
it points toward the heights of heaven and
light. In the other it points to the depths of
hell and darkness. The main question is
Which way is your face turned? The man
who in God many be no better
morally than the one who does not. But he
is pointed toward the light while the other
one is pointed toward the darkness, and no
one can stand still.

helieves

Everyone must move in
one direction or the other. So the speaker
again asked, “Which your
turned?”

Way is face

There is a time in the morning and in the
evening when the light is the same. But they
point in different ways. In the morning, the
dawn is a forerunner of the day while in
the evening the twilight is a forerunner of
darkness and the light. The main thing is
which way is the man headed,

Some people have the idea that they are
rottening only when they are going to pieces.
That is not The finer things go first:
The strings in the piano will break before
the walls crumble. The

sO,

flower in the pot
will die before the pot crumbles. So in hu-
man life the finer things go first. Those
spiritual things, the belief in the finer

touches of religion, will go before the rest of
the body.

Dr. Ogden told of how he had been so
proud of some new boots when he was a boy.
But should-boots always be the first aim of a
man’s life? Progress is the aim of life.
One must look toward the sters. Aud the
question is not only “Which way are you
looking, but which way are you leading the
world? Upward or downward 2"

“Christianity is
speaker,

not a theory,” said the
“It is a life, a way toward God.”

Mr. Munsey died not long ago and left his
millions to the world, A great banquet was
held in his honor just before his death and
in the course of the event, the crowd passed
the window. He asked the question, “What
does it all mean?” He was living worthily,
but he did not keep in touch with the younger
generation, A mother stakes in
future, so she meets it with courage.

During a drive to make Atlanta a better
city, a millionaire spent thousands of dollars
trying to help in the work.

A trained nurse freely flung her body into
the service of God for humanity until she
contracted a dreadful disease which wasted
her body. On her tombstone are these words,
“Greater love hath no man than this, that he
lay down his life for his friends.”

A minister of the Gospel spent his life
trying to live as God would have him live,
and trying to show Jesus to the world. He
helped in the work of making Atlanta a bet-
ter place to live in. One day he lost his life
in answering a call from a woman in a tene-
ment house in the city.

All three of these had stakes in the future.
They wanted to help the world to know
Christ. They had a love for humanity and
a desire to lead the world along the road of
light.

“The question for a man to face,” said
Dr. Ogden, “is ‘What can I do to make the
world a better world?’”

“Don't drift,” he urged.
life-work called of God.”

He closed with an appeal for the men to
study the question and to choose life.

quartet, led the singing.

Last Lyceum Gives
Humorous Program

The fourth and last number of the Lyceum
course, conducted by the Junior class, will
be presented tonight in Shearer Hall at 7:30,
“The Frazers,’ humorist entertainers, as this

number of the Lyceum is called, promises

to be the best of the series of shows that have
heen showed from time to time during the
past fall and winter.

The Frazers have built their program about
the idea that variety is the spice of life—
songs, sketches, impersonations, comic dia-
logues and readings contribute to the rich
store of variety upon which this versatile
company makes limitless demand... These
character entertainers and musicians, without
leaving the platform, can costume as a feeble
old man, an Trish paddy, an Ttalian, an In-
dian, a Jew, a Chinaman, an Englishman and
several other world famous character types.

This number of the Lyceum was secured
through the Piedmont Bureau of Asheville.
The admission charge will be 50 cents.

Charles Norfleet
Will Speak Sunday

Mr. Charles M. Norfleet, of Winston-
Salem, will be the speaker at next Sun-
day's vespers. Mr. Norfleet is a
teresting speaker, and is intimately con-
nected with the life of a church. He is
a big laymen in the Presbyterian Church,
being the Stewardship Commititee.
As a member ofthe State Committe
the Young Men's Christian Association,
he has done active work along that line.
In business life he the most

president and treasurer of the firm of
Froeber and Norfleet, a large wholesale
merchandise establishment,

Probably Mr. Norfleet’s most
Christian work has been done in connec-
tion with the Men's Evangelistic Club of
Winston-Salem, This club is one of the
Billy Sunday Clubs of the South, having
been formed after the Billy Sunday mect-
ings there last spring. It is divided into
ten teams, scattered over the city, cach
having at its head a president, vice-pres-
ident, and a secretary and treasurer. Mr.
Norfleet, as president of the club, holds

teams. Each team, composed on the
average of eighty-five men, sends out

representatives each Sunday to nearby
places where Sunday School and Church
is held, and at any other specified times.
One ofthe most successful revivals any
of the teams had occurred in the moun-
tains last summer, where a deputation
had been sent, at which time over one
hundred people were converted. The
club, as a whole, under Mr. Norfleet's
leadership, has accomplished great good
in Christian work, and still greater re-
sults are expected. |

Mr. Norfleet is a very good friend of
Davidson College, and has helped it in
many ways. It is earnestly desired that |
all the students on the Hill for this week-
end will be inattendance, as the speaker
is sure to come with a real message.

There has been a erying need for a center
of the social life at Davidson for many years.

The parlors of East, West and Watts have |

a place to entertain guests.

has furnished the hall formerly oecupied by
the Phi Gamma Deita fraternity. The loca-

purpose of this hall is to give all Davidson
men a place to entertain guests. It has been
rightly named the “Y" Social Hall and all
Davidson men are expected to take advantage
of the opportunity atforded by this hall as a
place to loaf and entertain their friends.
This hall will contain several periodicals and
magazines that are not to be found in the
library, but is not to be a reading room,

a center for the social life at Davidson,

During Junior Speaking the committee on
entertainment is planning to make this the

center of the social life. Many boys have

asked girls up and others are going to do

the same as this hall will solve the problem

has been fixed for the students and the “Y”
is hoping that the boys will make use of it.
