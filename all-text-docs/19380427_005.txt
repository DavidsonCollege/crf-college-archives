ceding the “exhibition” many stu-

who epposed tt, One boy (a junior)
declared that if the seniors insist-
ed upon, opening his room, the visi-
gor. would really get a Truc eduea-
tion Gy’ the subject of “housckeep-

the occasion is behind us. the re-:

hgllious attitude is not ta be found.

The question ist Ate” you

Here are a few of the thoughts
which this question evoked:
Hector McGeachy, Senior:

“|
ing an “Open House”
is an excellent idea.
It gives the schoot

friends of Davidson
to. inspect the com-
iertable and modern equipment of
the college. dt is afso one of the
‘iew chanees whieh the boys have
that enables them to entertain the
iacylty and residents of Davidson
who have done so much for them
during their stay at the college.”
Rufus Plonk, Junior:

our equipment should be made.
John McQueen, Senior:

_ “The idew of open
