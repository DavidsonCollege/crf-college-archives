Coach Hengeveld Accorded
Warm Welcome by His
Alma Mater

To Coach Basketball and Baseball
Teams This Spring

Davidson is indeed fortunate in
having secured Mr. Fred Henge-
veld, better known to the student
body as “Dutch,” to take charge of
her basketball and baseball teams
for this spring.

Dutch entered Davidson in the fall
of 1914 and for four years made
good his position on the basketball
and baseball teams. In his last year
he served as captain of the nine.

As Varsity center Dutch has had
few equals and no superiors in the
history of basketball at Davidson.
Not only was his jumping unusual-
ly good, but in his shooting of goals
he won a name for himself through-
out the Carolinas and Virginia.

In baseball his pitching was one
of the main factors in Davidson's
success during the four years which
he remained. A heavy hitter, as
well as a remarkably fine twirler.
Captain Hengeveld was hailed dur-
ing his last year at Davidson as the
premier college pitcher of the South.

Since graduating in ’18, Dutch has
been one of the regulars of the Lit-
tle Rock Club of the Southern
League, and he has made an enviable
reputation for himself there.

It was with a sence of sincere
regret that the student body learned
of Pete Crayton’s decision to resign
his position as coach, but it is with
real pleasure that it sees Coach
Hengeveld take his place. Dutch
can feel assured that every man in
college is backing him to the limit
as he takes up his new duties among
us.

Shenck and Chalmers, both of whom
are good players, but it seems that
several other fellows want their
place and they are going to have to
work to hold them. Prep. Hall, the
other varsity man is right in the
game and doing good work and will
no doubt be a great factor in bring-
ing success to the Red and Black
quintet. There are only two last
year’s subs, Brice and Doubles. They
are both handling the ball wit
great skill. Roberts, King, Price,
Oltman and Crawford, all of which
were stars in the class games last
fall. It seems that at least one of
these men will get a place on the
team. Romefelt, Johnson, Shep-
herd and McAlister were good in
football and now they come to seek
fame in the basketball world. They
are going good and no doubt about
two of these men are going to find
a place on the team before the year
is out. Coach Hengeveld is having
to rush as he has to have his team
in shape by Friday night at which
time they will meet the University
of N.C. A New Year’s wish to the
basketball quintet, “Success in every
game.”
