However, not many Pi Kapps
stayed on ‘campus, and several
long details were pulled. One of

the more noted ones was Goudy’s

to see the Duke-Tech game, as well
as a certain Jean Anronstein.,

Brother Raymond was operated
on for appendicitis Sunday after-
noon. Any visitors would be great-
ly appreciated.

PHI GAMS LUNCH
When the Fijis sat down to lunch

Saturday, the conditions outside
did not seem exactly ideal for
traveling. A count revealed that

many Phi Gams planned to remain
on the campus for supper, but when
the clouds lifted and the sun came
out, the wander lust got the better
of most of them.

Brothers Tony Darby and Jesse
Wooten were at Lynchburg doing
their part toward boosting the Wild-
cats in their fight against V.M.I.
