For the second year in a
row the IMAC overall cham-
pionship has narrowed down
to a race between the Delts
and the Pikas with only
tennis remaining.

Also for the second year

in a row the Pikas have
been elimniated and have
to watch the Delts try to
progress far enough in the
tennis. to overcome the
Pikas’ narrow lead. The
Delts need a second place
‘finish in tennis in order to
win the overall title.
,» The Pikas protected their
narrow 19 point lead in the
softball competition when
they nipped the SPE’s to
tie the Delts for first place
with a 10-2 mark. The Delts
dropped their apparent
championship with losses in

because “we're a lot deep-
er this year and there isn’t
as much difference between
the first and second teams.”

According to assistant
coach Turnley Todd the new
offense is beginning to fall
into place. “This is the new-
est theory in running an of-
fense. It promises to be
very effective with our. per-
sonnel, : |

“Offenses keep changing
in order to be effective.
First it was the single wing,
then the T, then the option
and now we're to the point
of the triple option.”

The new offense will bring
changes for Todd's charges,
the offensive linemen.
“There will be some changes
with the new offense as far
as blocking assignments go.
We'll be doing more trap
ping, more, double teaming
and more pulling than we
did in the past. There is a
great deal of pressure to do
more than pass protection.”

The flexibility of the of-
fense which is one of its
strong points also works
somewhat of a hardship on
the offensive line. ‘‘We’ll
have a greater number of
assignments to carry out.
In setting up the offense we
looked at differeni, blocking
systems and tried to de-
cide which would work best
for what we had in mind.

“It helps to have the ex-

+ perienced boys that we do

have this year, but in some
ways it might be best with

a newer group. The line we
have this year has played
for three years under
system and now they are
trying to master a new one.
But I think both the offense
and .the defense are begin-

one

‘ning to grasp the new sy-

stem

Todd continued, “It re
mains to see just how well
the new plays work, the
only way to decide that is in
games. It has possibilities
of being better for us.

The wishbone formation is
