Year Record

Announcement was made in New
York Monday that the late Robert F.
Phifer, an alumnus 6f Davidson Col-
lege in the class of 1869, an account of
whose death was given in last week’s
Davidsonian, had bequeathed to this
institution the sum of $30,000, which is
to be paid the college upon the death
of a sister, This
with elation by officials of Davidson,
since they -had no intimation that this

news was received

alumnus had placed Davidson in his
will.
The estate of Mr. Phifer is valued

around $200,000, and most of his for-
tune is to go to education and other
worthy institutions, The testator,
painter of admitted abilities, bequeath
ed all of his paintings, etchings and en-
gravings to the North Carolina State
Art Society, designated $30,009 to the
public library at Concord at the death
of four cousins at Montreat, N. C., and
the Concord cemetery is to be beauti-
fied by the erection of a memorial gate
and chapel through the will of Mr.
Phifer.

For the
officials

past
have

several years college
maintained that former
students of the college are more and
more remembering their Alma Mater
in wills. The of Mr.
Phifer’s gifts bears out this contention.
In the last five years approximately a
quarter of a million dollars has been
left tothe college upon the death of in-
dividuals, and the greater. portion of
this has ‘come from alumni.

One of the principal objectives of the
alumni office at Davidson is to influence
alumni to place Davidson College in
their wills, setting aside five per cent
of the estate as a minimum. This idea
is being carried through in the, local
alumni association meetings, and in a
proposed alumni bulletin this thought
will be presented to the entire alumni
constituency through an editorial.
