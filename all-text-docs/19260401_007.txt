only a sophomore, and J, A. Simpson is a
junior. Both will be back next year, and
Davidson should have a banner year in bas-
ketball.

In wrestling, W. D. Cox, captain, and J.
C. Frierson, captain-elect, were mentioned on
the all-Southern team. Neither of these men
were defeated, and Frierson holds a decision
over the captain of the Navy team, consid-
ered by some as the best wrestler in the
southeast. Harry Vance, considered by some
as the leading athlete at Davidson, was
awarded his third letter in the sport. This
gives Harry cight letters, and he should re-
ceive one in baseball. J. C. Barrington was
awarded his letter for the second time and
is one of the best wrestlers in his class in the
South.

Crinkley, Maulden, Davis and Estridge
were awarded their letters for the first time
and as all will be back next year the wrest-
ling team of Davidson should be among the
leading of the country. Among the meets
being planned for next year is one with the
Army at West Point. Captain Weems, the
coach of the team, is due much praise as the
record of the. wrestling team has placed us at
the front in wrestling this year.

“The Barrier” to be the
Biggest Film of Season

Lionel Barrymore and Henry Walt-
hall Star in This Pictre

The next picture show will be April 10th,
no picture being shown this week. At this
time “The Barrier” will be presented. Marce-
line Day and Norman Berry play the leading
roles in this very thrilling and fascinating
picture of the great northwest. Lionel Bar-
rymore Stack Bennett, and Henry B.
Walthall as Gale, bring out vividly the rug-
ged life of Alaska. One of the
most realistic fights ever staged before a
camera is said to have been staged by these
men for “The Barrier.”

A synopsis of the picture is as follows: A
baby girl is rescued from her brutal father,
an American ship captain trading in Alaskan
waters, by a kindly seaman, when her mother,
a full-blooded Indian, dies aboard the ship.
She is brought up in ignorance of her half-
Indian parentage and does not learn of it
until the eve of her marriage to an American
army officer. She determines to give him
up and returns to her father, from whose
brutality she is once more rescued, this time
by her lover, whose loyalty finally persuades
her to marry him.

College Raises Sum to
Equal Board's s Donation

$125,000 Given to Davidson to Match
$75,000 Donated by General
Board

Announcement has been made hy [. L.
Jackson, treasurer of Davidson College, that
$125,000 has recently been raised for the
endowment fund of that institution to match
$75,000 offered by the General Iéducation
Board of New York. This amount was raised
with the assistance of $70,000 that was not
included in pledges made in the $600,060
campaign.

When this campaign was launched several
years ago, the college had a two-fold pur-
pose: to increase the endowment and to add
to the building equipment. The first step
was toward the erection of a wing of Cham-
bers building, which need was paramount.
Efforts were then turned to the endowment,
which culminated in the raising of the $125,-
000 by March 15th, and now the cfficia!s
going to double their efforts to raise moticy
enough to complete Chambers oiuiding.

The present wing is only one-third of the
planned building. Approximately $200,000
has been spent on the south wing, and it is
estimated that by the time ‘he remaining
two-thirds is completed $600,000 will have
been spent.

Colleges of State Give
Comments On Ideal Girl

“The Carolinian” Quo Quotes The David-
sonian as Other Papers Follow
Suit

When the girls of Converse initiated the
search for an ideal man, the students of Da-
vidson came back with their conception of
an ideal girl. This does not quite end the
story, for now the other school papers in the
state are following up with their idea of a
feminine masculine perfection. “The
Carolinian.” of N, C. C. W.,. printed
Davidsonian’s composite,
attached: “We wonder
1,700 girls measure/up to the ideal of The
Davidsonian?~ It’s too bad that the dream
girl should have such little understanding,
since she is wearing a number four shoe and
is five feet, five inches tall.” The students
probably thought that a smaller shoe would
cramp her style.

P. A. throws
pipe-peeves
for a loss

AND the bigger they are, the harder they fall,
as Shakespeare or somebody said. You can
prove this beyond question with a jimmy-pipe
and a tidy red tin of Prince Albert. Any time.
Anywhere. As a matter of fact, tackling pipe-
grouches is P. A.’s regular business.

Cool and sweet and fragrant, P. A.’s wonder-
ful smoke comes curling up the pipe-stem,
filling your system with a new brand of pipe-
pleasure. You smoke—and smile! For.the first
time in your life, you’ve found the one tobacco
that scales to your blueprint of bliss.

Slow or fast, no matter how you feed it, P. A.
never bites your tongue or parches your throat.
Those important items were taken care of in
the original plans by the Prince Albert process.
Get yourself a tidy red tin of this friendly tobacco

| PRINGE,

—no other tobacco is like it!

P. A. is sold everywhere in
tidy ie tina pound and half-
pound tin midors, and
pound crystal-glass humidors
with sponge-moistener top.
And always with every bit of
bite and parch removed by
the Prince Albert process.
