Davidson’s Wildcats dropped
their fifteenth game of the
season in Charleston against
the Citadel Monday night by a
79-70 score. The Cats eleventh
straight road loss of the season
continued an almost unbeliev-
able draught away from home in
recent years. In fact, this year’s
Seniors have seen but two road
victories since they came to
Davidson.

During the first half, the Cats
trailed by as many as 13 points.
Two straight buckets pulled
them to within 9 points at the
intermission, 40-31.

In the second half, John
Gerdy warmed up and slowly
brought the Cats back into the
ballgame. A Gerdy jumper with

12:14 remaining tied the game
at 52 all. The final 10 minutes,”
though, were filled with frustra-
tion for Davidson.

After tying the game two
more times, the Cats ran into
foul and turnover troubles.
Gerdy, Brian Rowan and Todd
Haynes fouled out, crippling
any chance for a late Davidson
rally. The Cats were guilty of 23
turnovers for the game. Closing
minute free throws iced the
Bulldog victory.

John Gerdy’s 27 points lifted
him into second place on the
all-time Southern Conference
scoring list, with 2,325 career
points. Jamie Hail contributed
a game-high 10 rebounds for the
Cats. The Citadel was led by
Tommy Slawson’s 21 points. ©

Last Saturday night, David-
son traveled to Western Caroli-
na and fell by a 87-74 score.

The Wildcat swimmers made
duck soup out of the undefeated
William & Mary Dudley’s Mo-
ther Duckers (that’s their name)
last Friday (59-54) in a swim
meet that proved.to be “‘one of
the greatest of all time.’ It was
neck and neck the whole meet;

_the final event found the catfish

down by four points.

Shattering the previous
school record by two seconds
the team of Beck, Alon, Finger,
and Voight won the 400 free
relay, and gave the Wildcats
their ninth victory.

“‘We lucked out, we won three
races by one tenth of a second,”
remarked Coach Pat Miller. She
went on to say ‘This is the first
time the team gave one hundred
percent effort, and it payed

mer was a double winner, while
Voight. took three first places
and broke his. own school record
in the 50 yard free-style (22.1
seconds).

The catfish continued their
sweet success the following day
by humiliating VMI by the
score 64-47. Keith Riddle and
Warren Beck each took two first
places, and Craig Finger won
the 200 butterfly.

The Wildcats record stood at
10-1, yet Coach Miller refused
to be overly optimistic. She has,
however, expressed high expec-
tations for the conference meet
coming up this month.

On Tuesday, the Wildcats
were edged out by conference
rivals Appalachian State (59-
54). “We lost a lot of close races
that we should have won,’’
commented Miller. The Moun-
taineer divers’ really hurt our
chances by capturing 14 points.

One bright spot of the meet
was Freshman Warren Beck; he
broke the school record for the
200 yard free style by 1.2
seconds and won the race.
Shremmer captured the 500 and
1000 yard free style while
Voight took the 100 free style.
Coach Miller hopes to even the
score with Appalachian at con-
ference. The Catfish take on
three tough teams this week-
end. They travel to Atlanta to
meet Emory, Georgia State,
and Georgia Tech.
