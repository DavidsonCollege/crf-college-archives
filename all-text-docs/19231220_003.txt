Our Weekly Fable

Once there were two Yokel Lads who
|lived in the tall Timber, back where
| taxicabs are Conspicious by their Ab-
|sence. Where they lived was so far
|back that used Walnut logs for fire-
wood and Blackgum for tooth brushes.
| These boys had the Same father and
| mother, or as the vulgar would say, they
were brothers. The older son was one
of Earl e. leiderman’s own. He was so
hard that he took a cool Shower as often
as-once a month and rubbed down with
barbed Wire.. His name was Zeke.

His younger side-kick had a visage
like a Peeled Onion topped off with
Deralax. He looked like He had been
Melted and poured in His Clothes and

on their cedar chests and hollered
“Eureka.”
Then these two twains meandered

homeward to pull the Bell, Rope on a
Mule and Feed the Chickens once more.

Do You See the Point |

After Reid Maxwell left Shorter Col- |
lege at Rome, he raved for three days |
about what a fine place Shorter is. Well, |
we once heard a girl contend that David- |

|son was lots better than Yale or Oxford, |
fand she

had never been here and the
only person she knew who comes here is
Bill MeClain.

After the Glee Club left Brenau, Tootie
Crayton’s watch was 20 minutes fast, but
he decided that it didn’t matter, since he |
was in Gainesville.

Watt MeCain discovered that the long-
er you linger at Shorter the longer you
want to linger.
