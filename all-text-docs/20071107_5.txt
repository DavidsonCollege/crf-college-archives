Pen Stealer on the Loose

Campus Safety has issued a
school-wide safety alert following
the disappearance of several Bic
ballpoint pens and a Uniball felt-
tip.

Victims report his pick-up line is
most frequently: “Hey, 1 forget a
writing utenstil...mind if I borrow
one and give it back at the end of
class?”

But for this crook, borrow is a
synonym of steal. He fancies
clicky pens, chews on caps and like
to a savage shark about to attack,
he is especially attracted to foun-
tain pens with shiny metallic parts.

Guy Abuses Car-Locking Privileges

Filmore Jenkins has an inferiori-
ty complex. An ex-high school
football player who didn’t quite
make it, he feels the need to make
up for his lack of self-esteem by
repeatedly locking his car so that
the light flashes and the horn honks
can be heard by anyone within a
50-foot radius of his 1984 Mazda
Miata. Sometimes he presses the
lock button on his electronic key
four or five times, just so people
know that he is legit because he

“It makes me feel pretty good
about myself because then people
know that I don’t just ride a bike or
something...More street cred, ya
know...,” he said.

Jenkins has been seen by friends
and neighbors occasionally using
the “behind the back” or even the
“through the legs” locking tech-
nique with his keys, imitating a

“I’ve never actually played bas-

press the lock button once on his
electronic keys, but, when his per-
formance at work began to wane,
he decided he needed to be taken
more seriously.

After an intense two-week lock-
ing spree, sources close to Jenkins
reported that he was distraught
over his friends’ ignorance of his
“unlocking skills.”

Jenkins felt like he was only half
the man he could be when he could
not hear a horn honk upon unlock-
ing his vehicle.

“The lights would flash and all,
but after a while’ it got sort of old
without the horn honk. So IT took
my car back to the dealership and
now my car honks anytime I lock
it, unlock it or recline my seat. 1am

Mediocre Sporting
Facilities Continued

Davidson enhanced its reputa-
tion as the home of the most
mediocre collegiate sporting facili-
ty in the South last Tuesday when
the Board of Trustees announced
plans to break ground on a 50-
meter cinder track and a two-lane,
above-ground swimming pool.
Those projects were given prece-
dence over the construction of a
tetherbal! pole, which is tentatively
scheduled for completion in late
2011.

These projects are very much in
keeping with the standard set by
the landscaping of Davidson's Par
9, three-hole golf course, on which
four-year-olds regularly shoot par
with Fisher Price Clubs. “A three-
hole course is ridiculous,”
Davidson Men's Golf Team captian
Jonathon Koo said. “It's like ask-
ing the swim team to practice in a
kiddy pool.”

“Some students think our golf
course is a little sub-par,” Athletic
Director Michael Ditka chuckled,
“but what they don't realize is the
premium we place on academics.”

The track team, however, is very
much excited about the construc-
tion of the new cinder facility,
which is also to include a pole

vault pit, a high jump mat, and an
area for the long- and triple-
jumps.

A student plays on one of the run-
down tetherall courts outside
Baker Sports Complex.

“We're really pysched about
this track, even if the surface was
last used in the late 1950s and
runs roughly 10 to 15 seconds
slower per mile, on average,”
Davidson Men's Track and Field
captian Jan Bialos said. “It's also
great because our long-jumpers
no longer have to practice in the
sandbox of the kids my girlfriend
babysits on Davidson Concord.”
