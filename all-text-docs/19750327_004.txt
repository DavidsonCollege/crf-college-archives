Student bill of rights

The SGA Senate decision this week
to put Mr. Kline on retainer for legal
services was a positive move for in-
suring the rights of Davidson students.
The revised bill of rights, now being
drafted in committee after initial
rejection by the Board of Trustees,
demands the legal expertise of a
lawyer representing student interests.

At first glance, the hiring of a
lawyer to protect basic student rights

may seem unnecessary. Yet basic

rights students have as American
citizens such as freedom of the press,
freedom of assembly, and others once
considered inalienable are now being

challenged. We must assert that
students do not give up their con-
stitutional. rights by attending a
private college such as Davidson.

Recognition of students as adult
members of this community, respon-
sible for their actions, guaranteed
their freedoms, stands at the basis of
any improved relationships between
students, faculty, administration, and
other members of the college com-
munity.

We commend the Senate for this ac-
tion, and we look ahead with con-
fidence to the acceptance of the
student bill of rights by all groups in
the community.

Watchu.z our P.D.Q.’s

During the past several years, the
college has granted $9,000 annually
towards the funding of the Artist
Series, the Public Lectures Series, and
other related programming.

With this supplemental money, the
College Union has been able to bring
to Davidson such attractions as Mar-
cel Marceau, Indian Ambassador T.N.
Kaul, Ralph Nader, William F. Buck-
ley Jr., Senator Fred Harris, Dick
Gregory and Buckminster Fuller.

Such high quality programming is
threatened however, in the 1975-76 en-
tertainment schedule because the Ad-
ministration has decided to discon-

tinue its funding of artist and lectures
series.

The Administration states that it is
committed to improving the ex-
tracurricular life of Davidson studen-
ts.

Yet, in its decision to withdraw
$9,000 from the Union budget, the ad-
ministration has denied the college
community the exciting entertainment
that it has enjoyed in the past.

We urge the administration to rever-
se its budgetary decision concerning
artist and lectures series funding and
thereby help to sustain an acceptable
level of entertainment programming
for the Davidson temmulnity.

Balancing the social life

The programming of social ac-
tivities on campus last weekend
typifies the need for closer coor-
dination of Patterson Court and
College Union entertainment plans.
With no fewer than three parties on
Patterson Court, one concert, and one
dance, each activity had to compete
with several others for an audience.

Although we appreciate the alter-
natives offered students during one
small block. of time, subsequent dry
spells in the Davidson social life argue
for better coordination of such ac-

tivities.

Further cooperation between these
two major programming groups can
only lead to a more balanced social
life and better value for students
paying for professional entertainment.
We strongly urge Patterson Court to
send a representative to all meetings
of the College Union Roard and vice
versa. We look for each group to com-
plement the unique programs of the
other rather than continue programs
which compete._with each other for
student time and attention.

CROP support

At a time when. most Davidson
students are simply concerned with
the quality of their three-meals-a-day
plan at ARA Slater, the Good Friday
fast and fund raising activities for
CROP offer opportunities for raised
consciousness of hunger outside of the
immediate Davidson College com-
munity.

We commend Bob Mooty, Bill Bond,

and other members of the Eumenean -

Society for sponsoring these moves to
help alleviate world hunger. We are
also particularly appreciative of the
gestures of support from ARA Food
Director Ron Scott and Davidson
College Presbyterian Church mem-
bers.

We strongly urge members of the
college community to contribute
financially to CROP and also to go
without food for one day.

I hope those it may concern

This is obviously the issue of

November

Last night I had a dream. I
dreamed I heard a voice say
unto me, ‘“‘Go thee into Lub-
berland and there make unto
thee a new college.

And the money shall run,
yeah even unto the art depart-
ment, the mighty shall be hum-
ble ad the humble shall be had
by the graduate schools. And
the balances of education shall
be adjusted. Amen.”

rousing speeches have no effect
