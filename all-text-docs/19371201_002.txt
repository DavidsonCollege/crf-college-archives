Red Cross...

Jn chapel last week an inconspicuous notice
concerning the current Red Cross drive was -
read, 1 cause such as the Red Cross deserves
more than an inconspicuous notice.

_ In the past. Davidson sudents have not
“joined the Ked Cross in as large numbers as
might be the case. Profiably this has been duc
to the Christmas Seal iund and the local “Y"
fund both being raised the same time of te
year. «As. Prof. Beaty, head of the Davidson
branch of the campaign stated,.“It seems as if
more hoys would be willing to give up four
shows."!| And that is ali of “material” nature.
that is reauired tor membership.

Quoting irom the American Red Cross
pamphlet: “Flood waters of greater magnitude

ing to two million people in the Chio and
Afississippt valleys in 1937, —

The Atmeriean Ked Cross. meeting the
greatest disaster reliei needs in its history, res-
cued, ied, shcltered, clothed and gave medical
aid to victims in cities, towns. villages and
darms in 320 counties in twelve states. Five
hundred lives were iost and the Red Cross hos-
pitalized 6.700 sick and injured. Flowses were
rebnilt, repaired, reiurnished, live stock re-
placed and means of livelihood restored for
more than a quarter million families.”

There is a-conerete examp'z of the Rec. Cross
work during the past year. The Red Cross
always stands by waiting for an opportunity to
aid in any phase of life. At some time it
touches the life of every one of America’s
one hundred twenty million citizens.

Gullible’s Travels...

“There's one born every minute.” said Bar-
num and the weil known circus magnate knew
what he was talking about.

In his lecture Monday night. Dr. Howard
lliggins, Dean-of Emerson. interestingly and
iascinatingly curnished further evidenee of the
truth in the mighty Barnum's statement. Dr.
{hggins material was not altogether new to
the average person. Spirit mediums have
created some stiz at various times. Flowever,
—~-his prasentation of the fake methods of mied-
iums and the revelation of the wicks of their
trade offered a new approach to the subject and
a biting Lat deserving attack upon the “spirit.
medium rackez.”

We feel, howeyer, that such a man as Dr.
‘Rhine, of Duke University, who is carrying
out experiments in extra-sensory perception
(ESP). is honest in his work. Dr. Higgins
- also expressed his belief that Dr. Rhine's work

is thoroughly conscientious, although he ad-

mitted he disagreed with some of his work and
felt that: other methods would be more reveal-
ing :
There has been so much evidence presented
that we cannot help but feel that there is some-
thing to this “mental telepathy” business.

appealing note to men and women today.

[ With The Staff |

Complaining about things is ai! too pre-
valent a pastime hereabouss. ycodness knows,
but there is something that we'd like briefly
to call to your attention, The remedy is in your
own hands, too. and wondt require a single
peuivon,

It is this matter of chapel services, Manners
there. as vou may have noticed, are most con-
spicwously absent. From ithe ovcasional whis-
tled accompaniment given the organ during
the prelude. to the flock of paper airplanes
during the student announcements, thete isn't
much to indicate that the student. body is the
gentlemanly group it is assumed to be.

As someone remarked to us recently, often
the iaeulty member conducting the service fails
to get anything like the attention or even respect
to which the is entitled. Studying in chapel is
rade, to say the least, and in our meager ex-
perience, it never does much good, anyway.

Prohahly the most obnoxious of these bar-
barisms, though. is the hindering of students
trying to make announcements. Often. the
etiect is that the announcement is torally un-
intelligible to many to whom it is addressed ; it
might almost as well have never been mace.
This heckling is sometimes unintentional and
is always good natured, of course. but the re-
sults are the same, ~ Virtually everyone who
stands in chapel has something to say of a
real izaportance to a number of the audience,
and it is only right that they be permitted to
hear. [laving a little fun at the expense of a
irientdd may be all right. but the thing is mighty
easily carned too fan .

What with the danees this week-end, we
think it only appropriate to pass on to vou a
litle dope on the present state of the “big
apple.” Our Prineeton correspondent intorms
us that this danee, which with the “little apple”
was so neat the beart of true Southerners last
summicr, still survives—nay, even flourishes—
in the frozen North. ft hives, however, only in
a warped and twisted form. In Yankee hands
it has lost its pristine grace.

As might have been expected, the ching has
been terribly commercialized. Now dancing
masters like Arthur Murray will teach you
their version .-for a price, Anyway one of Mur-
tay's troupes of professional applers enter-
tained at a big party at Princeton the other
night. According to our friend. the best they
could do was a disreputable sort of “shag.”

Being something of an appler himself, our
man felt perhaps he had better look into the.
matter. Cornering one of the performers, a
girl trom Brooklyn, he asked if she knew how
to apple Southern-fashion.

“That way,” she retorted, “is not dancing.”

““The educational spoon in America is hand-

do the feeding themselves,” quoted Dr. Alexis

MATTHIS ATTACKS
LAST WEEK'S
LETTER ...

To The Davidsonian:

1 wonld Vike to take this op-
portunity to reply to a letter
published in last weck'’s Dav-
idsonian in its “J.etters to the
Editor” column. The David-
son student who. didn’t fave
the backbone or the strength
ot his convictions to enable
him to sign his name obvious-
ly didn’t know what he was
talking about. A few narrow-
minded under-dogs lke this,
who never miss a ¢hance to
kick their superiors in the
back, have kept us from Guad-
ing that complete unity among
the student. body which we
want.

The men referred to in his
letter are the most outstand-
ing, the most popular men on
our campus, Why this un-
known considers himself cap-
able of passing judgment on
such men as these, | can't
quite sée. w

These men did not give their
approval to or sanction‘ the
cause of the “disagreeable cir-
cumstances of a few weeks
ago.” But when thev saw
they oouid help two of their
fellow students who were ob-
viously the victims of circum-
stance, they immediately did
all in their power to aid them,

LINGLE DISCUSSES
SCHOLARSHIPS...

(Continued from Page 1)

scholarships are not larger.
Nearly every scholarship the
College has is based upon an
endowment af $1,000 which
somebody in the past has giv-
en Davidson for scholarship
purposes. In other words, a
scholarship is the annual in-
come on $1,000. It takes some
mighty good financing at this
particular time to make.Sl,000
vicld $50 a vear. Incidentally,
ri may say that we always have

more applicants than we have,

scholarships. With this in
mind, the catalogue says: “It
is earnestly hoped that only
those who are in absolute need
will appl® for scholarships.”
Let me say again that the
College has no music scholar-
ships and never has had any.

Very Sincerely ‘yours,

WALTER bk. LINGLE,
President.
