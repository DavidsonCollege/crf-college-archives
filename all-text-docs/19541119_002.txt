Take Ten Giant Steps

When a Johannesburg delegate from
the Dutch Reformed churches of South
Africa to the Second Assembly of the
World Council of Churches announced
that he would not vote against the Report
of Group V, Intergroup Relations—The
Church Amid Racial and Ethnic Tensions
(which included among other stirring
statements: “The church of Christ cannot
approve of any law which discriminates
on grounds of race, which restricts the op-
portunity of any man to acquire education
to prepare himself for his vocation . . . or
in any other way curtails his exercise of
the full rights and responsibilities of citi-
zenship . . .”) The Christian Century (Sept.
22, 1954) commented, “Evanston may have
known no more Christian moment.”

One wonders what a Davidson under-
graduate, whose Southern segregation sit-
uation is not nearly so severe as that of
the South African student, would have
said and how he would have voted. And
what would have been the commentary of
a Christian contemporary in the twen-
tieth century? Could it be said that David-
son had not known a more Christian mo-
ment? In an institution that is avowedly
Christian, and although not “narrowly sec-
tarian,” officially controlled by the Synods
of a Christian denomination and in a stu-
dent body that is 97 percent “pure” as re-
gards professing membership in Chris-
tian churches, there is surprising evi-
dence (see other columns on today’s edi-
torial page) that we are not all even start-
ing at the same point in our segregation
discussion.

This was made embarrassingly clear at
Wednesday night’s Segregation Forum as
well. We are still raising such questions
as Should the Supreme Court have ruled
segregation unconstitutional? Does the
majority of the population of the South
want the end of segregation? Are most of
the members of the Davidson community
willing to admit Negroes to Davidson? To
the exclusion of the questions: The Su-
preme Court has ruled; how can we best
implement its decision? World and local
movement indicates that the end of seg-
regation is imminent; what can we do to
facilitate adjustment? The highest court

of the denomination which founded and
fosters Davidson College has recommend-
ed the admission of Negro students;
should we not be studying the practicality
of accomplishing that end?

Do not fear. The cause of segregation
is being loudly sounded. There are those
who are representing the right of the
states to determine the constitutionality
of segregation in public schools. There are
those who are raising the very real social
problems which will surely result from
the end of segregation. There are those
who would seek peace by begging the
question. There are many even in our
midst who just do not think it’s worth it.
These opinions are essential to our Amer-
ican idea of free exchange of opinion. And
they are being well represented. How-
ever, that is not the contribution which
the Christian community has to make.
Nor do we believe it is the witness that
the Christian college has to bear.

We believe that the approach of the
leaders of the YMCA is sound. In the
chapel presentation and open forum this
week they emphasized time and again
that we should not be engaged in a de-
bate on segregation; the Christian ap-
proaches the problem not as a debator
but as a mediator. His aim is to be in-
formed; his advice is to adjust; his hope
is to accomplish the fulfillment of the
Christian principle of brotherhood involv-
ed. It is unthinkable that Davidson has a
choice to make. We are several steps be-
hind. The choice about segregation in the
public schools has been made. The choice
about whether Davidson should admit
Negroes has been implied. The choice
about separating individuals solely on the
grounds of race in any situation has been
eternally devided if not universally un-
derstood.

We have a job to do as citizens. But we
have a special task to do as members of a
Christian church, living in a Christian
community, attending a Christian col-
lege. Some of us have some catching up
to do. Some of us have some steps to

take—forward.

A Thanksgiving Litany

We thank thee, O Lord that we are
white and not yellow or red or brown or
black. The Bible does teach that “while
men looketh on the outward appearance,
God looketh on the heart’ but the out-
ward appearance counts for a great deal
below the Mason-
Dixon line!

We thank
thee, O Lord, that
we ere North
Americans and
not South Ameri-
cans, for there is
a vast difference
as everybody

knows; and that

ML

iteme, St

we were born in these favored United
States and not among the gringoes of
Mexico or the Canucks of Canada.

We thank thee, O Lord, that we are
Cecidentals and not Orientals—‘“one of
those lesser breeds without the law.” Yes,
it is true that Confucius, Buddha, Abra-
ham, Moses, Ghandi, and Kagawa were
great men, but we never liked slanting
eyes or the wrong shape of noses.

We thank thee, O Lord, that we are
Gentiles end not Jews. Of course, Jesus
was a Jew and many others of that race
were princes of Israel when our ancestors
were Nordic Barbarians, but that was a
long time ago and should not be brought
up now.

We thank thee, O Lord, that we are
Protestants and not Roman Catholics. Yes,
it is a fact that for hundreds of years the

Roman Catholics preserved the Church,
long before anyone ever thought of Prot-
estantism, and our denomination no long-
er brands the Pope as that “anti-Christ
and son of perdition,” but anyway put it
to our credit that we are Protestants.

We thank thee, O Lord, that we are
Southern Presbyterians and have remain-
ed aloof from those “unsound” Yankees.
Yes, it is true that there is “. . . one Lord,
one faith, one baptism, one God and
Father of us all. . .” but everyone knows
we just take literally the parts of the
Scripture which confirm our prejudices.

We thank thee, O Lord, that we have
been blessed with minds and resources
to come to s college of the calibre of
Davidson instead of to merely o state
school. We rejoice that our alma mater
tops even the Ivy League schools.

We thank thee, O Lord, that we shall
sit down to a delectable Thanksgiving
dinner in a comfortable home and dressed
in the latest fashions. Yes it is true that
two-thirds of the world is starving, but
there must always be poor people. Any-
way, we have shown our noble character
by attending church on Thanksgiving
morning and singing contentedly: “O
Jesus I My Cross Have Taken, All to leave
and follow thee—destitute, despised, for-
saken .. .” in dedicating ourselves anew
to a sacrificial suffering Christianity. ,

SEGREGATION: SYMPOSIUM OF A SOUTHERN COLLEGE

INTEGRATION:

Not Elsewhere: Here

BY RONALD WILSON

Segregation, to understate the
ease, has become an issue. The
question which relevantly affects
the Davidson College community
is this: Should we admit Negroes
to Davidson as students? What fol-
lows is a brief evaluation of the
pro and con arguments, especially
as they tie in with the functions
of the governing body of Davidson:
the trustees.

With the decision of the Gen
eral Assembly lest spring fev-
oring integration, the Board of
Teustees must decide whether
they ere willing to abide by the
dictum of the governing body of
the church, or whether their
affiliation with the Presbyter- .
ian Church, U. S. is binding on-
ly on matters which meet with
the trustees’ approval. The trus-
tees meet in February, and it is
es yet unknown whether this
matter will even appear on the
order of business.

Secondly: Can Davidson, consid-
ering itself a Christian college, al-
low itself to fall behind other se-
culer universities which have al-
ready admitted Negroes (i.e. the
law schools of UNC, Tulane, and
University of Va.) It would seem
that the church is among the last,
rather than the first, actively to
secure equal rights for the Negro.

Thirdly: What is the sentl-
ment among those people whom
it will most divectly effect—
the administration, the faculty
and the student body? Some
members of the administration
and faculty have entertained
Negroes in their homes, end
many students have worked with
colored people. Dr. Cunningham
hes publicly ennounced that he
felt the Supreme Court made
the only decision which could
be morally justified.

Reliable opinion indicates that
more members of the student body
and faculty are in favor of inte-
gration than are opposed to it;
however, there is no significant
majority. Those opposed to it are
more vehement than those in fa-
vor of it.

Arguments opposing integra
tion have more of an emotional
foundation than a rational one.
Blological inferiority of the Ne
gro is quickly refuted by any
competent physiologist. Lack of
morel cheracter, intelligence,
ambition, and all the other per-
sonal shortcomings which have
stigmatized the Negro may in
many ceases be true, but the evi-
dence seems to point to his en-
vironment as precipitating such
behavior, rather than eny here-
ditary shortcoming. Many whites
manifest the same type of per-
sonal shortcomings.

The “coup de grace” of the seg-
regationists maintains that if you
are willing to admit him to school,
then you must be willing to have
him marry your daughter, sister,
etc. This does not necessarily fol-
low. The Armed Forces accom-
plished integration which affected
over 4 million men; yet there has
been no hue and cry that miscege-
nation has arisén from such inte-
gration. .

Thus the problem for Davidson:
To admit, or not to admit, Negroes.
Certainly it is one which requires
ethical and personal consideration
on both sides.

SEGREGATION:
Why Force The End?

BY CORTY COOPER

The nature of man is seldom
changed suddenly by a legal de-
cree. Changes in any social order
must come slowly and laboriously,
and instantaneous revision of a
way of life cannot be wrought by
an edict of law alone. Yet many
individuals throughout the nation
are convinced that the recent Su-
preme Court decision is all that is
necessary to destroy the whole
pattern of segregation, and to es-
tablish an integrated social order
in which there will be no distinc.
tion made in this country on the
basis of race, religion, color or
nationality.

This objective is altogether
laudable end certainty Christian.
However, the methodology being
pursued and the attitude exhi-
bited by integrationists In both
North and South seems anything
but laudable.

Those in favor of the Supreme
Court ruling favor immediate in-
tegration of schools and universi-
ties in the South. The Davidson
student should realize that this
will soon entail admission of Ne-
gro students to D. C. Those in fa-
vor of integration are approach-
ing the problem with fervent emo-

tional zeal, convinced that theirs
is the absolute righteous view-
point. But do they stop to ponder
the tremendous problems involv-
ed? If they do, I have heard lit-
tle of it.

Lew ts lew, and fect is fact,
but a way must be worked out
to resolve the great problems
imposed by the decision. For
example, the stetes of Georgie
and Mississippi alone employ ap-
proximately 14,000 Negre teach-
ers. When integration comes,
meny of these will no longer
hold teaching pesitions. Many
Negro principals will also find
themselves out of their fob.
Will the policy now being pur-
sued benefit these? it seems that
it may only serve to deprive cer-
tain effective, dynamic citizens
of the joy of engaging in their
chosen vocation. This eppears te
be a valid consideration.

Davis Lee, Negro publisher of
the Newark (N.J.) Telegram says:
“Right now the Southern Negro is
in a better spot educationally, po-
litically, and economically than the
Negroes anyplace else in the
world.” He feels that the southern
Negro is very much respected by
southerners, and that the Negro
himself can do more about im-
proving conditions than can courts,
legislation, or pressure groups.

Perhaps many Davidson students
feel likewise, but have been label-
led “Segregationist” and placed on

often realizes that expectation. I
see, however, no evidence of in-
nate (used here as biological or psy-
siological) inferiority used to jus-
tify an unequal status.

On the other hand I have seen
myself to be both functionally and
inately inferior to Ultimate Re-
ality — God. This inferiority is
what many call sin. Beginning to
apprehend God, a person begins
to apprehend his and all men’s
basic inferiority.

But isn’t the “good news” the
fact that God has totally accepted
all of us—inferior though we are?
And doesn’t the Cross at least
mean that He now releases those
who accept his love from the bonds
of inferiority, and begins to make
real men out of them?

How can anyone who realizes this
call another inferior to himself?
He can appraise variation in indi-
vidual talent, but can he call dif-
ferences indices of basic inferiori-
ty when all men are equal in the
most genuine experience of all—
living worship?

Total Acceptance Leads To

Easy Integration

If men are not basically unequal,
then segregation seems out of
place. If the power to release men
from “social inferiority” is in the
hand of man need we stop with
a@ separate but equal view? Can
you realize and express to others
the acceptance you have found in
this limited way? This seems to

a shelf with no respect paid their
views. It seems to me that all of
us must consider these views if
we all have: the interests of the
southern Negro at heart; and I be-
lieve that we do.

As an observer of debates and
bull sessions here at Davidson con-
cerning how the decision applies
to us, I have been impressed by
the fact that there is as much pre-
judice and blind assurance of be-
ing right on the part of those in fa-
vor of integration as has been
shown by those against integra-
tion. Yet the hue and cry of those
favoring integration has been that
all emotionality and prejudice lie
with those not in favor. If any
resolution is to be achieved, both
sides must recognize the merits of
the other’s stand. Christian under-
standing is never fostered by blind
self-assurance on the part of eith-
er faction.

INTEGRATION: —
Do We Veto God?

BY LEIGHTON MeCUTCHEN

Herein I am approaching pos-
sible integration from a religious
viewpoint. I have had to condense
the ideas below, so I welcome fur.
ther chance to discuss their mean-
ing. My motive is simply to aid
you in rationally coming to a con
viction on this question.

What is A Man Basically?

First, I clearly see a functional
inferiority in many Negroes in our
Southland. Our society expects men
of color to play inferior roles and

lead to total integration, especial-
ly here at Davidson. Being gen-
uinely interested in others growth
more than our own, we can now
include boys with potential col-
lege ability into Davidson.

If intermarriage should occur in
some instances, why does that
frighten those realizing their ac-
ceptance. The individual’s deter-
mination of his marriage partner
will not be snatched from- him;
rather it will be put more secure-
ly into his hands as legal and cus-
tomary prohibitions against his
picking a partner from another
race will begin to drop out.

If we have really understood
how Ultimate Reality has totally
accepted man as His son, then I
fail to see how we can deny total
acceptance to others.

SEGREGATION:

A Southern Problem

BY JIM BRICE ©

T have been asked to write an ar-
ticle defending racial segregation.
I would not go to the Bible and
find verses of scripture to prove
that segregation was instituted by
God, as many men would do; 'm
not that much of a fundamentalist.
Nevertheless, I don't believe that
anyone can prove from the Bible
that segregation is opposed to the
will of God, As I see it, segrega-
tion is a social problem and should
be looked upon as such.

The recent Supreme Court de-
cision has forced upon the south-
ern states the greatest social prob-

lem they have faced since Recon-
struction. It is a problem which
cannot be solved in a short period
of time, and it is a problem which
must and will be solved by the peo-
ple of the South, not by rulings
from Washington.

1 would venture to say that be-
fore last May 17, race relations in
the South were better than they
had ever been. Segregation was
dying, slowly but surely. For ex-
ample, Negroes have voted in my
state during the past five or six
years and have had a relatively
free choice of train seats, both
with tittle white opposition. From
my own experience, I can tell that
the attitude has changed in the
past six months. The white people
have taken a more belligerent at-
titude toward the Negro, even be-
fore the ruling has been imple-
mented.

To those who hold the view
that segregation is unChristian

and should be abolished imme-
dietely, « wish to pose the fol-
lowing questions: ts It Christian
to implement a ruling which
will tend to pit white egainst
Negro, and the relations
between the two have been
improving so greatly in past
yeers? Is it Christien to take o
drastic step which stands a bet-
ter-than-average chance of lead-
ing to actual ermed conflict and
violence? Is it Christian to take
a step which will deprive thou-
sands of Negro school teachers
of thelr jobs? Think seriously
about these things.

Immediate integration would
tremendously lower the standard
of education in the public schools
of the South. It is a fact that the
1.Q. of the average Negro is around
13 points’ below that of the aver-
age white man; I would guess that
in the southern states, the differ-
ence is even greater. I think it is
evident that an influx of Negroes
into the white schools could not
help but lower the standard of edu-
cation. For example, what would
happen to the academic standing
of Davidson College, or any other
school, if half the student body
were replaced with students who
had 1.Q.’s 13 points lower?

Racial Pride

I think it must be admitted that
the end of segregation will lead to
miscegenation, thereby eventually
destroying racial characteristics
and racial pride. Though there are
those here at Davidson who are
diametrically opposed to this next
view, I believe that racial pride
has been one of the greatest stim-
uli for the ambitions of most great
Negroes. Is it right to take away
that pride? .

After all is said and done, I ad-
mit that racial segregation is doom-
ed to die in the future, though it
might be the distant future. I con-
tend, however, that it will end just
as soon (maybe sooner), and with
a thousand times better feeling
between the races, if the matter of
integration is not pushed and shov-
ed by outsiders and radical south-
erners. .

You will find that the people of
the South, independent as they
are, have never accepted peaceably
anything which was rammed down
their throats, and there is no rea-
son to believe that their attitude
toward facial integretion will be
any different.

INTEGRATION:

Miscegenation? Ha!

BY BILL GALLIER
Since the Supreme Court issued
its decision against the constitu.
tionality of racial segregation as
maintained by twenty state school
systems, multitudinous opponents
to such a relaxation of one of our

‘most venerated social barriers

have arisen to damn the ruling
with all the vigor of one who feels
the intrinsi¢e standards of his so-
ciety to be destroyed.

Among the contentions of these
assailants are the illegality of the
Court's decision, Scriptural refer-
ences supporting segregation, and
the lowering of educational stan-
dards in regions most immediately
affected by the ruling. It is not
this observer’s purpose to uphold
the legal validity of the decree, to
refute perverted Biblical interpre-
tations, nor to disparage popular
misconceptions concerning inher.
ent physiological and intellectual
deficiencies of the Negro, though
they be wholly environmental.

Another tenet, and probably that
to which these social reactionaries
cling with most tenacity and emo-
tion, is that the dread specter of
miscegenation will be transformed
from an innocuous literary term
for amalgamation of the races into
hideous and brutal reality. Logic
would have it that small white
boys, growing to handsome Cau-
casian manhood in desks beside
small black girls, in turn develop-

ing attractive colorful maturity,
would come into intimate social
contact with Negroes in his scho-
lastic environment, become emo-
tionally attracted to one of them,
and marry her, in time producing
children of mixed blood. But this
is mere speculation; let the exper.
jences of those areas long having
had integrated educational systems
be viewed. Is intermarriage there
an accepted and frequent social
practice?

At present there are being pro-
duced in American Negroes, at the
rate of 3.6 percent per generation,
genes which are essentially Cau.
casian hereditary factors, This fig.
ure is undoubtedly lower than that
of a century ago at which time the
aristocratic progenitors of those
who now most fear miscegenation
were indulging themselves with
their female slaves who might ex.
hibit no will in the matter. Furth.
ermore it would appear that those
modern mulatto offspring are pro-
ducts also of illicit. sex relations,
for the Caucasian-Negroid marriage
rate is simply not of proportions
to produce the rapid transfer of
genetic characteristics that is now
taking place.

To illustrate the interracial mar-
riage rate, Los Angeles (Cal.)
County may be taken as a case in
point. This county is approximate
ly ten percent Negro as is the Unit-
ed States as a whole. In 1938 the
state of California declared its
anti-miscegenation statute uncon-
stitutional. Since that time the rate
of marriages between whites and
Negroes has been little more than
one tenth of one percent.

If it may be assumed that Cali-
fornians are no less inhibited than
are those residents of other states,
it may also be assumed that their
miscegenation rate may be fairly
accurately projected to encompass
the nation, if this includes a South
in which miscegenation is possible,
i. e. where integrated school sys-
tems exist. In the light of such a
minute interracial marriage rate,
need we be alarmed by the pros-
pect of the immediate defilement
of our race should the day of in-
tegrated educational institutions
be upon us?

No Social Chaos Now

BY BOB JONES

Reared, as I have been, in the
atmosphere of a very conservative
home, I have naturally always con-
sidered segregation to be the only
way of life. Indeed, I think that ir-
reparable damage would be done
to the people of the South if this
institution were abolished. Not that
I have anything personally against
the Negro .. . On the contrary, I
have many close friends among
the members of the colored race.
My stand is merely that both the
white and the colored races are
much better off in being segre-
gated.

In regard to the religious as-
pects of segregation, I have found
no conclusive evidence as to the
un-Christian like characteristics of
this institution. To be true, we
should respect and love our color-
ed friends, But why can't this be
done without throwing down all so-
cial barriers? In my opinion this
could only lead to miscegenation.
Of course, one is reminded that
this would not be the case in the
South. I realize that at first it
would not be a problem but even-
tually it would, and I would not
like to see our country populated
by a mongrelized, “tan” race.

In considering the Supreme

Court decision, I am reminded of
an editorial by a Negro editor of
a Trenton, New Jersey newspaper.
In the article he pointed out the
detrimental aspects of “desegre-
gation” of the southern schools.
One of his main points was the
fact that many Negro schoolteach-
ers and principals would be thrown
out of jobs by this action. Statis-
tics were quoted showing the in-
comes of the southern Negro tea-
chers . . . they far surpassed those
of the northern teachers.
. T also think it wrong for this de-
cision to be forced on us. To be
true there is a definite trend tow-
ard abolishing segregation. (Al-
though I think this is very unfor-
tunate, it seems to be true). Why
can’t we be allowed to solve this
ourselves?

In the long run it wuuld save
much violence and also help to
preserve the close relationship
which exists between the southern
white and the Negro. Instead, we
are constantly being invaded by
the modern carpetbaggers who ac-
tually have no use for the Negro,
but whose main desire, evidently,
is to stir up the southern Negro
and destroy the existing relations

. between our races,
