Lockhart and three lasses from the land

Lockhart’s Scotch

company composed

of plaid and thistle, entertained on the
second number of the Junior Lyceum pro-

last Thursday evening. The Shearer

Hall audience was made up from the
major part of students.

The Lockhart group was Scotch in all
but one respect. Although they boasted
Scotch names, wore Scotch plaid and
kilties, and offered Scotch songs and
humor, they were distinctly un-Scotch in
their willingness to grant liberal encores.
The students appeared to reccive espe-
cially well the ballads, humorous songs,
and instrumental solos. For the better
part of two hours the audience was
granted the privilege of hearing a
choicely balanced and highly entertain-
ing lyceum program of music and read-
ings.

Miss Ilene Redds played several selec-
tions of modern saxaphonic jazz, Miss
Mary Gorham showed fine skill with the

violin, and Miss Lucile Mylchreest join-
ed Mr, Lockhart in a number of Scottish
and classical vocal duets. Each of the
ladies played accompaniments on the
piano, and Mr. Lockhart appeared in a
number of recitations and clever inter-

pretations of the dramatic solos that
have made Harry Lauder famous. The
decidedly Scottish twang maintained

throughout the evening in all depart-
ments of the entertainment was unique
and the quality of the music discredited
the popular belicf that nothing good in
the way of music comes from Scotland.
The first part of the program was
opened with “Lest We Forget” and the
last with “Blue Bells of Scotland.” Violin,

piano, and saxaphone combined in a
medley ranging classical numbers and
Scottish ballads to such modern jazz as
“Brown Eyes.” Judging from the ap-
plause the “eyes” won out although the
entire offering seemed to be enjoyed.

vorite songs of McCormick, Kreisler

the repertoire of Mr. Lockhart and his
Scotch Lassies.

In order to give all Prospective shicks in
college an idea of what it costs to be so popu-
lar with the weaker sex, Mr. Rosy “Straw-
berry” McMillan has kindly permitted us to
Teprint this letter which he received some
time ago from Miss Gloria Swanson, of Hol-
lywood, Cal. It s only one among many, but
It serves to give some idea of the kind of
mail Mr. McMillan gets every day.
“Dear Mr. McMillan:

“No doubt you think I am very bold in
writing to you, but really I am in earnest,
You won't get mad? Promise? Well, that’s
that.

“Maybe you would care to know just what
I look like. So I am sending you under sep-
arate cover a life-size photograph of myself,
and I sincerely hope that it will mect with
your approval. Before I heard of you [

devoted my days to thinking of you and my
nights to dreaming of you. Are you a col-
legian? Well, any way, I am. I attended

way he parts his hair, but I have been spend-

I don’t know about that since I have heard
of you.
“Yours and yours only,

Flake Laird spent one

holidays. He reports that he had a fine
vacation but it wasn’t so very success-
ful, as he only brought back three new
pictures for his table, and he had to
swipe two of them.

Mr. Forrest T. Franklin spent the holi-
days with his girl, Miss Somebody's
Darling, of Greenville, N. C.

Mr. Lucius Linton Deck drove to and,
from school in a U-Push-It. Just drop
around to his room, he will tell you all
about the trip free of charge. Plenty of
sleeping space without cost if you will
only keep your hands out of your ears.

New York City had as its guest for
the holidays, Mr. Cornfed Derrick Smith,
formerly of Trenton, Tenn., now of New
York. The key to the city jail was turn-
ed over in the lock after he entered its
walls. Reports from all New York pa-
pers state that he vamped allthe nurses
in four hospitals and ate peanuts in ev-
ery showhouse in the big city. He re-
turned to school last week, after-letting
a gold digger swipe all of his jack ex-
cept two cents. She even slipped a note
in his coat pocket saying that she left the
two cents so that he would be able to
write home.

Mr. Harry Lee Vance spent the holi-

days in Mount Mourne. His attorneys

have advised him to make no statement
until a later date.

Mr. John Fowler, of Statesville, N. C.,
spent the Yuletide in his home city. He
will be able to return to his work next
week.

As his Christmas gifts, Mr. Harllee
Bordeaux received three quarts of gin
and a copy ofthe well-sung old song,
“Show Me the Way to Go Home.”

Sister Sloan entertained at his room
last Saturday evening. There were about
two present. Among them were, Roland

Watts, the basement of Shearer, and oth-
ers, too inferior to mention. Several hot
