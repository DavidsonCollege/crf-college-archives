Administration, Council
Rap Student Misconduct

The administration and facu!
ty, and-the Student Council in
separate action took steps to
curb misconduct in chapel and
in vespers. The action by the
two groups climaxed discuss-
ion which began last spring

President D. Grier Martin in
his address to the student body
‘Bhursday morning announced
the new policy. regarding chap-
e], and a mimeographed sheet
was distributed to all students
explaining tha new rules.

ALTERED SCHEDULE

The chapel schedule has been
altered, with Monday, Tuesday
and Thursday designated as
assembly days. The responsi-
bility of securing speakers and
programs for the Monday as-
semblies was assigned to the
‘Student Council. The Tuesday
assembly was designated for
non-religious programs and the
Thursday chapel was set aside
jor religious programs.

In another new policy,
students not in their assigned
seats by 16:20 will be consider-
ed absent and tardies have been
abolished. To compensate. for
the discontinuance of all tard-
ies, free cuts in chapel will be
increased to eight for freshmen
and sophomores and to 12 for
juniors and seniors.

BEHAVIOR RULES

The new rules announced by
Dr. Martin .also state that
students whose behavior inter
feres with chapel program
will be subject to disciplinary
action up to and including re-
quired withdrawal from the
college

There will be no announce
ments made at chapel with the
exception of emergency § an-
nouncements approved by the
president. Instead, mimeograph-
ed sheets containing announce-
ments will be distributed at the
doors of the auditorium follow-
ing the Monday and Thursday
assemblies.

He said that the new policy
is the product of a long period
of discussion,

TRUSTEE RESOLUTION

Last May the Trustees adop-
ted a resolution stating their
stand on required assemblies:

= . the Trustees havé re-
affirmed their conviction that
required religious exercises are
a vital and necessary part of the
program of Davidson as a Chris-
tian college, and that we ex-
pect the full cooperation of the
administration, faculty and stu-
dents in making this program
effective. This recommendation
envisions the taking of any dis-
ciplinary measures which. may
be necessary to see that stu-
dent behavior at prescribed re-
ligious services is in keeping
with proper standards of cour-

teous ard orderliness at all
times.
“This applies also to student

behavior at other prescribed
exercises not of a religious na-
ture.”

In an interview with the
DAVIDSONIAN, President Mar-
tin said, “I have thought about
this problem more than any
other because I am so ashamed
of what some people have had
to put up with.”

Shue Reads Riot Act
To Freshman Upstarts

As a result of the freshman

riot Sunday night, the Student

Council in special session Monday morning, passed a recom-
mendation to the Executive Committee of the faculty stating
that any future rioting be automatically followed by a cancella-

tion of all cut privilidges of the entire freshman class.

This

This would include classes, student assemblies and chapels, and

Vespers.

The Student Counci! further
recommended that the penalty
for any cutting of these activi-
ties after such action has been
taken be the same as for over-
cutting—i.e., campusing or loss
of quality points of the indivi-
dual student. Judgment as to
what constitutes a riot would be
made. by the Student Council.

The riot occurred Sunday
night, September 11, on the lawn
in front of Belk Dormitory for

issued the following statement:
“The Executive Committee is
opposed to student riots as a
matter of principle and will
give serious consideration to
the recommendation of the
Student Council concerning any
student or group of students in-
volved in a riot. The Commit-
tee will not hesitate te restrict
cut privileges or to impose
heavier penalties if the situa-
tion should warrant it.”

The modified chapel schedule
was adopted last spring shortly
after the meeting ef the Trus
tees by the Religious Life Com
mittee. Other parts of the new
policy were developed during
the summer Dr. Martin said

The recommendations for the
new policy were presented at
the faculty meeting Monday and
were approved.

NO OBJECTION

President Martin added that
he has no objection to other
persons holding different views
on compulsory exercises. How-
ever, he said that he would not
defend anyone guilty of mis-
conduct because the new policy
