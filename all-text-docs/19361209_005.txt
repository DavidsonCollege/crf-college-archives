Believes Monarch Will Abdi-

Dr. Frazer Hood, professor
of psychology, when he
quizzed the current love
tangle between King Edward
VII of. England and «Mrs
Wallis Simpson, the American
horn woman on whom the
King now lavishes his affee-
tions to the extent of endan
gering his position on the
throne of the British Empire,
had the following remarks to
make last, Monday morning:

“It is significant that in all ngws

“Nasty Dilemma”

To the question, “What dy you
think King Edward should do, fol-
low the alleged royal duty or listen
to the dictates of his own personal

feelings?” Dr. Hood had this to
say:
“It is a nasty dilemma. If I were

an Englishman I would unqutestion-

ably say that duty to empire came
first. As an American and com-
moner it leaves me in a quandary,
not knowing which ‘horn’ of the
dilemma to seize.
