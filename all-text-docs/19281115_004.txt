PLANS ARE COMPLETED

Alumni Office Has Plan Placing
Considerable Emphasis on
Home-Coming Occasion for

Past Six Months

If the advance sale of reserved
tickets are any indication, then the
number of Davidson College alumni
who will return for the annual Home-
Coming celebration will exceed the
number of any previous year, a wider
territory will also be covered, and a
greater number of classes will be rep-

resented. Since the State-Davidson
game in Greensboro last Saturday,
when the Wildcats played the best
game of the season, requests have

been pouring in, for the alumni know
the manner of fight exhibited by the
Wildcats when they play Carolina at
home, and are expecting them to nobly
perform next Saturday.

During the summer and early tall
the alumni office here has been placing
emphasis upon this event, and have
either enclosed a card indicating the
exercises of the day or extended an in-
vitation to each alumnus who was
written a personal letter. In addition
to this seventeen men in as many dif-
ferent classes wrote a letter about
Home-Coming Day, which was mailed
to each of his classmates, and added to
this was an invitation from the presi-
dent and alumni secretary of the as-
sociation, and a_ specially prepared
alumni newspaper with the thought of
Home-Coming as the principal theme
of it. A radio program was also given
last Tuesday night, outlining the ex-
ercises of the day.

Considerable preparations have been
made for the entertainment of the vis-
itors, and the secretary has been en-
deavoring to systematize his office to
facilitate matters . Many students have
been asked to assist in giving informa-
tion to the alumni and in directing
them about the campus, and several
organizations have offered their co-op-
eration for the day. It iS-an occasion
when students, faculty and all others
around Davidson are hosts to the men
who were former students at the col-
lege.

Elsewhere in this issue of The Da-
vidsonian is a detailed account of the
events of the day, starting with the
R. O. T. C. parade at 11:15 in the morn-
ing, and ending with the stunt night
performance in Shearer Hall Saturday
evening around 10 o'clock,

Alumni Marriages

Rankin-McCaskill

Newspapers throughout the’ state
carried an announcement Sunday, No-
vember 3rd, of the marriage of Miss
Coma McCaskill to. Thomas William
Rankin, both of Fayetteville, which
was solemnized at the First Baptist
Church in that city.

Mr. Rankin is a member of the class
of 1909, and is connected with the
hardware firm of A. E. Rankin & Co.,
of Fayetteville. He is among the most
popular sportsmen of North Carolina,
being a past president of the North
Carolina Fox Hunters’ Association.

Quite a stir was created recently in
England when the Prime Minister of
England, Mr. Stanley Baldwin, was elect-
ed Lord Rector of Glasgow University.
The students, according to time-honored
custom, voted, but they went much fur-
ther, to the extent of fighting over the
po'ls. When the Baldwin supporters ob-
tained a strategic position over the polls
they were vigorously attacked by a bar-
rage of some five thousand dozen ripe
eggs, not to speak of countless codfish
heads ‘and soft, rotten fruit. When the
aroma of battle cleared the result was
found to be 1,044 for Baldwin, as com-
pared with 978 for his nearest competitor.
