alumni that “if the system is put through
as I favor it, some of the best lecturers
will give courses two or three times a
week for which there will be no examina-
tion and for which half credit will be
given. ‘I think that this will serve to
acquaint the students with the subject
matter without having them bother to an
unnecessary degree about preparing for
examinations.

“Snap courses have often worked out
very well. A course at Harvard which
was reputed to be very easy turned out
many very good geologists. The faculty,
however, did not approve of the existence
of any course as easy as this one, with
the result that there have been no good
geologists produced since the abolition of
the course.”—The New Student.

ANY way you figure it, P. A. is better tobacco.
Take fragrance, for instance. Your well-known
olfactory organ will tell you. And taste—who
can describe that? And mildness—you couldn’t
ask for anything, milder.

Yes, Sir, P. A. is cool and comfortable and
mellow and mild. Long-burning, with a good
clean ash. You never tire of P.A. It’s always the
same old friendly smoke. Get yourself a tidy

red tin and check everything I’m telling you!
