Recurring Themes Echo
As Spencer Views Year

AN ANALYSIS

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

Recurring themes of evol
ution, appeasement and opti
mism echoed from the Love
Auditorium rostrum yester
day as College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. ad
dressed the academic com
munity in his state-of-the
college speech, “Overview
‘71 & °72.°

No devastating bomb
shells. No revolutionary pre
dictions. Just a quiet look at
the yvear ahead. That was
the tone of his remarks.

While last year's speech
was marked by revolution in
the social system as well as
in academics, the _ presi-
dent's speech this year call-
ed for a rational evolution.

Coeducation, predicted to
be a hot issue on the campus
this year, was handled de
licately. The president di-
rected the Educational Po
licy Committee (EPC) to de
termine during the year,
“the educational and eco
nomic feasibility of coeduca
tion.”

The president further di
rected the EPC to elicit
opinions of all the college's
constituencies: students, fac-
ulty, staff and alumni.

Concerning intercollegiate
athletics. Spencer steered a
cautious course between
those students critical of sub
sidized athletics and pen-

Laundry
Decision

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

A laundry poll released this
week by the Student Senaite
reinforces the administrative
decision to cut laundry serv-
ices rather than increase the
present laundry fee.

The poll conducted last
year asked students to list,
in order of preference four
laundry alternatives.

Most of the students re-
sponding to the poll said that
they would rather have serv-
ices cut.

He said that Davidson will ~
continue the present subsid
ization of lootball until the
college can determine wheth
er the Wildcat Fund = can
raise sufficient funds to con
tinue the present football
program.

Davidson will also support
a recommendation to the
NCAA that all athletic grants
at member colleges and un-
iversities be awarded on the
basis of financial need only.

The president calied for
continued evolution of stu
dent participation in college
affairs. He mentioned that
the proposal for student re
presentation on the Admis
sions Committee and on
the Budget, Building and
Grounds Committee will be
brought before the faculty
at its first meeting.

Spencer also gave his sup
port to opening faculty meet
ings to elected representa
tives of the student body and
to college administrative of-
ficers.

“Both groups are involved
in the educational process.
Both have something to give
as well as something to get
from participation. I hope
that we faculty will
seriously consider modifying
the present procedures to al
low attendance’ of — these
groups.’ he said.

Evolution in the academic
program was also emphasiz
ed by the president. He en

coureged the development of
independant study programs
as well as those in foreign
study. He also urged that
junior year abroad students,
who return to the college
their senior year,  partici-
pate in a special program
which would take directly in
to account the junior year
experience.

Spencer also asked for
suggestions concerning sum
mer activities at the col
lege. He mentioned institutes
in management and = South
Asian Studies as well as en-
richment programs for sec
ondary school juniors and
seniors.

To soothe the wounds
suffered Jast year by the
various college constituencies
Spencer in his speech also
indulged in a form of ap-
peasement.

placed second in preference.

The third most popular al-

directed Mr. Stacks to do
something that would put the
service on a break-even prop-
osition,” said Robert Currie,
treasurer.

Currie said that the laun-
dry fee has remained the
same for ‘three consecutive
years which were character
ized by extreme inflation.
“We finally had to do some-
thing about the deficit,’ he
said.

“‘Last year no more than
20 per cent of the student
body used the pant pressing
service,” said Director of the
Laundry C. W. Stacks. *‘Con-
sequently we retired the girl
that pressed the pants and
we retired the girl that han-
dled the administrative de-
tails of the pant service.”

Stacks said he hoped that
in thé future an arrange-
ment could be worked out
whereby the student would
decide what laundry services
he wants and thus the stu-
dent would pay only for those
services. ,

LOOKING DOWN FROM AN OVERVIEW

Spencer looks to Davidson’‘s future.

students Bo Phillips and Don
Parman and William E,
Jackson, assistant professor
of political science, is that
“home is where you find it.”

Both Phillips and Parman
were denied registration by
the Mecklenburg County
Board of Elections on their
first visits. At a Wednesday
morning appeal of Executive
Secretary William Culp’s de-
cision in the two cases, the
board of elections upheld the
decision not to permit regis-
tration.

Speaking for the board,
Mrs. Samuel C. Hair stated
“Ty think that the board's posi-
tion on this. issue must be
very clear. We must uphold
the law as it is written and
interpreted for us by the
state elections board. How-
ever much we may disagree
with this position philosoph-
ically, we are not in a posi-
tion to change tthe law. That
must be done on a state or
federal level.”

Phillips indicated that the
two had expected to be re-
fused by the elections board
at their appeal. “‘We want to
ge the issue into the courts
where the legality of the res-
idency requirements for stu-
dents may be decided. Our
statement was written to
demonstrate that it is not our
intention to be residents of
Mecklenburg County after
graduation. We want to vote
as students who spend four
years in Davidson.”

In their prepared state-
ment Phillips and Parman
called the required oath of
intent ‘‘discriminatory” and

refused to sign it.

The next step is the courts
where Common Cause, a
populist lobby, will under-
write court costs. The David-
son case will be one of sev-
eral in the state of North
Carolina. Other key tests are
being pressed in Greenville,
Chapel Hill and Raleigh.

Jackson had earlier involv-
ed Jerry Dean, a 1971 gradu-
ate in a similar test last
spring, but the case was
dropped when no money for

legal fees was available.

If the case is decided in
favor of the students, it can
have heavy repercussions in
areas like Davidson and
Chapel Hill where a signifi-
cant proportion of the eligi-
ble voters would be students.

Quips & Cranks
To Arrive Oct. 10

ROBERT TOUCHTON
Asst. Managing Editor

Last year's Quips and
Cranks, the Davidson year-
book that never came, should
be available about Oct. 10,
according to Ronnie Conoley,
last year's business manager.

The publishers, the Ameri-
can Yearbook Company, plan
to ship the volume on Oct. 2.
Copies will be mailed direct-
ly to graduated seniors.

Conoley explained that he
had been working all sum-
mer ‘to get the yearbook, but
that about 60 pages had been
lost in the mail late last
spring, necessitating their re-
doing.
