Mountaineers Defeat Wil

AN ANALYSIS
By CHARLIE TERRELL

Asst. Sports Editor
When Jim Brakefield came to
Appalachian State University as
head football coach, his first
plan was to move flanker Clay-
ton Deskins to running back.
Brakefield knew what he was

doing.

Although Deskins carried the
ball only eight times during the
Apps’ 35-10 victory over the
Wildcats last Saturday, he was
a thorn in the 'Cats paws all
afternoon and Coach Dave Fagg

was unable to find a mouse to
remove him.

Deskins, who sent the Moun-
taineer fans into hysterics when-

bled for 66 yards, including two
touchdowns.

‘Cats Finish Fall Baseball

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

The Davidson Wildcat base-
ball team finished their season
yesterday afternoon with a
game at Belmont-Abbey.

This may sound unusual in
the first week of October, but
the team did indeed finish its
fall season yesterday. _

The fall season is designed
to allow coaches to see how
well their new crop of players,
both freshmen and sophomores
who saw little action in the pre-

vious season, play, and to al-
low veterans to begin to get back
into the swing of the game.

Davidson’s fall season consists
of four games, two each with
Pfeiffer and Belmont-Abbey.

The 'Cats did not fare espe-
cially well in the win-lost fig-
ures, winning only one game
prior to yesterday's contest, but
Coach Tom Stevens were not
perturbed.

“You don’t really play base-
ball in the off-season expecting
to win,” he said, ‘‘the season is
set up so inexperienced play-

Freshmen Improve
In Western Meet

By JIM HANNA
Copy Editor

The Davidson cross-country
team suffered its first dual-
meet defeat of the season Mon-
day, when the harriers of Coach
Sterling Martin were outrun by
Western Carolina.

Western, which last year
placed eleven men ahead of
Davidson’s first man, this time
put only five runners in front
of the number one Wildcat,
freshman Ricky Bell, for a per-
fect score of fifteen to David-
son’s forty-seven.

Bell finished the five-mile race
in twenty-nine minutes and one-
half second, one minute and
forty-one seconds behind the
winners, Terry Helms and Ben
Bailey.

“I was regal pleased with

Ricky’s race,’ said Martin, ‘He
should come on strong for us
now.”

Bell had run a poor race two
week-ends ago in Stone Moun-
tain, Ga. due to cramps  suf-
fered during the race.

Following Bell for the ’Cats
were freshman surprise Paul
Mitchell in 29:50, team captain
Howard Boyd in 30:39, Joe Shi-
bley in 30:58, and another sur-
prise, freshman Bob Lauten-
sack, who was timed in 31:01.

The Wildcats’ next meet will
be Monday, when they will run
Wake Forest here.

“The Wake Forest meet will
be a good one for us,” said
Martin.

“They have a good team, but
if we run well and have some
respectable times, we have an
even chance of beating them.”

ers can get some game exper-
ience and the team can try out
new strategy.”

Other schools, he indicated,
may not agree with this inter-
pretation of the fall season.

The Davidson team that play-
ed these four games differs
greatly from the team that will
take the field in the spring.

Most of the varsity players
that will be returning to the
team in the Spring do not play
in the fall.

Jack Lattimer is recovering
from a knee injury from last
year. Harold Wilkerson, lead-
ing homerun hitter for last
year’s Wildcats is playing foot-
ball, and Rick Pipan and Bill
Barnhill did not participate in
the fall season either.

‘Most of the upperclassmen
schedule their rough courses in
the fall so they will have more
freedom in the Spring,” Stevens
said, “and, besides, I know how
well they can play.”

Stevens said that game stra-
tegy can also be very different
in the off-season contests.

“We can often run through
five or six pitchers in a game,”
he said, “just to see how they
play.”

Stevens was excited about
several of the freshmen that
have come out for the team,
particularly Mark Riseman, a
catcher, and Bill Todd. He said
both are good hitters.

He also complimented the
playing of Bobby Clayton, a
second baseman.

“A couple of freshman pitch-
ers might develop, too,” he
said, “but now they need a lot
of work.”

fenders expecting a run, as Aglc
was considerably behind his
closést man.

Deskins was not the only of-
fensive star for the Mountain-
eers. In last week’s pre-game
story, we noted that Apps quar-
terback Steve Loflin was not a
feared runner.

Steve Loflin is a feared run-
ner. While the 'Cats line was
preoccupied with Deskins, Lof-
lin executed the triple option
plays beautifully and gained 51
yards on 18 rushes.

Had his passing been more
on target, the score might have
been worse. Loflin overthrew
several wide-open receviers.

It seemed that whenever Lof-
lin stuck the ball into the belly
of halfback Mike Horton, the
‘Cat defense did not know who
would emerge with the ball.
Horton shared the brunt of the
Apps running load, lugging the
ball 15 times for 96 yards.

We also pointed out that the
Mounties defense had a ques-
tionable secondary.

The Mounties no longer have
a questionable secondary.

Cornerback Roger Hinshaw
proved to be the ringleader of
the Apps pass defense as he
intercepted two passes and
broke up several others.

The excellent coverage of the
secondary was complemented
by a fierce pass rush, led by
ends Eddic Biggs and Steve
Chapman.

On many occasions Wildcat
quarterbacks Rick Kemmerlin
and Scotty Shipp were forced
to unload their passes too quick-
ly, or to hold the ball and suf-
fer a loss.

The 'Cat offense sputtered in
the opening quarter, but took
advantage of two breaks to re-
gister their ten points in the
second stanza.

Defensive end Jim Purcell re-
covered a fumbled pitchout at
the Mounties’ 25, and the ’Cats

deats 35-10

moved in from there. Johnny
Ribet cracked over ‘from the
two for the ‘Cats touchdown.

Things went right for the
‘Cats on the ensuing kickoff as
John Barbee .recovered an on-
side kick at the Apps 49. A fum-
ble gave the ball back to the
Mounties, who proceeded to
give it back to the ‘Cats as
Steve Fleming blocked a punt
which was. recovered at the
Apps 34.

Shipp passed to Randy Parker
for fifteen yards and following
a loss and an incompletion, he
connected with Ribet for 15
more. From there Harold Wilk-
erson split the uprights and the
‘Cats trailed 21-10.

After a-halftime which saw
two marching bands, a chorus
line, a Highland fling, and
cheers by the many Boy Scouts,
the third quarter began.

Deskins boosted the Apps
margins to 28-10 with a one-
yard sweep around right end,
and the ’Cats began an ill-
fated march toward the goal.

A penalty put the ball on the
Apps 30, and Shipp passed to
Parker for eleven yards. Shipp's
next. throw was incomplete, but
pass interference gave the ’Cats
a golden opportunity at the once.

Two runs by Bill Bracken, one
by Ribet and an incomplete
pass failed to push the ball
over, and chances of a come-
back were thwarted.

Ribet was shaken up in that
series, and his replacement
John Webe! scooted for 51 yards
in only four carries.

Another sophomore, Dave In-
gold, was a forlorn figure as
he attempted to return punts
for the ‘Cats. The Mounties line-
men who frequently stormed in
on him must have thought he
was a revenuer who had dis-
covered their moonshine still
deep in the Watauga County
hills.
