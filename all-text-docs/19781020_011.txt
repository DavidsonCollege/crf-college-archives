Prepare for tough week

Cats top Catawba

By ROB GILLISON
Staff Writer

It was a genuinely pleasant
experience to watch a Davidson
soccer team completely domin-
ate an opponent—well, for a
half anyway.

With two tough games at the
end of this week, The Citadel on
Thursday and Baptist College
on Saturday, it seemed that
Catawba was going to be a
confidence builder in prepara-
tion for the Cats’ tougher
opponents.

Through most of the first half
Davidson dominated the game,
passing, defending and scoring
(three goals) with ease. But
toward the end of the half,
control of the game seemed to
be slipping away.

“I warned them rather stern-
ly at the half,”’ said Coach Karl
~ Kremeer, “that they could turn
this game into a rout, but if
they gave Catawba a goal it
would be an entirely different

oMiautes into the half they
gave Catawba a goal and it was
an entirely different game. ~
While the Wildcats fought to
regain control Catawba just
fought, kicking the ball when-
ever it came within reach.

“Our problem seems to ‘be
something that I just never
expected from these kids—men-
tal,” explained Kremser.

“They don’t get completely
involved in the game. You have
to be mentally prepared for each

‘game. We just seemed to fall

asleep at the end of the first
half,”’ “ . ; _—
To the squad’s credit, they
were able to pull off a lopsided —
3-1 victory with nearly 40 shots
on goal. But all the easy games
that Kremser feels they should
have won are behind them.

“The remainder of the sea-
son is the hardest part,”” muses
Kremser. “I just don’t know
what to expect.”
