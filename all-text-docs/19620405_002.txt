At The Beginning

At an enthusiastic pe ges, Ma
oy en Body voted for

SONIAN makes its initial bow.

In the inauguration of such a
newspaper, many questions no doubt
arise. “Why a coll weekly? Does
it have a real value? t will it stand
for?”

The newspaper is largely what its

name implies, of news. It
should be in close touch with every
of college life and the life of

e community about it. Even in a
small college, life becomes more and
more complex, and as the students

are broken up into an increasing num-

feeling of mutual interest and en-

nt. In addition, there are
the which vitally concern every
student, and yet which are not well
known or misunderstood.

But the boundaries of a college
are not the limits of its campus.
close contact with it every day is a
community which is certain to in-
fluence and be influenced by the
student. The town column _ should
make every man feel he has friends in
the town, and their interest in the
—_ should be increased by the
weekly items and topics about it.

The old Davidson spirit which
has held sway at Davidson in tradition
and fact for years upon years goes
with the graduate that leaves her. He
scans the daily paper for any stray
paragraph of Davidson news, and

ps with a loyal c the hand of a
vidson man. THE DAVIDSONIAN
should go to the home of every
alumnus, let him know what is
on every week at his alma mater an
unite undergraduate and alumnus,
alumnus and alumnus in one common

lege and concern colle: ’
the paper must not follow blindly. It
should lead, not lag. It should mould,
not be moulded by the sway of campus
opinion. It should stand for the best
things in every line. This may neces-
sitate occasionally a firm but kind
criticism, which, however, often re-
moves an obstruction and clears the
way for more concerted and faithful
effort.

The Annual is the yearly mirror
of college life as it is, a large edition
of “Life” in student language. The
Magazine is the monthly expression of
the literary talent of the college. The
weekl ee will not encroach
on either of them; rather it will strive
to advertise and strengthen them. But
it needs exactly what the other pub-
lications must rely upon, the support
of the students and of the frignds of
Davidson. With your constant and real
help, it can be made newsy and strong.
It can bring to you all the latest hap-
penings of interest in the college and
town. It can increase the spirit in
athletic, literary, social and religious
life here; it can be a link between col-
lege and community, alumni and alma
mater, THE DAVIDSONIAN asks for
your earnest cooperation.

FACULTY ONCE GAVE CENSORSHIP RULES

Paper Assumes Right Of Self-Criticism
After Half-Century Struggle Of Freedom

BY DON SAUNDERS

Davidsonian Associate Editor

What is the function of the
editorial page of a college news-
paper? Since 1914 THE DAVID-
SONIAN editorial column ‘has
widened its coverage and con-
cern to include all issues of
academic life. The freedom of
DAVIDSONIAN editors has
grown in proportion to the de-
velopment of mature criticism
which characterizes a thinking
community.

In a 1916 editorial P. B. Price
defended an editorial stand
condemning church misconduct
by noting that “THE DAVID-
SONIAN is not to set forth only
the glories ‘and virtues of the
college, and hide that which is
unlovely.”

This right of free criticism is
a heritage proudly guarded by
American newspapermen, but

has not always been a part of
collegiate tradition. At a 1925
conclave of N.C. college news-
papers DAVIDSONIAN editors

joined in “begging that the pub-
lications be allowed to express
within their columns the true
thoughts and ideals held by the
mass of students.” Harlee
Branch, Jr.., then

editor, asked, “Is THE DAVID-
SONIAN _ allowed to exercise
freedom of the press?”

His question was not answer-
ed publicly, When the editor of
the Davidson College Magazine
was removed from office by the
faculty for a story exhibiting
“low moral tone,” the paper
made no protest.

In 1930 DAVIDSONIAN edi-
tor J. Wilson McCutchan said
that the function of a college
newspaper is to expose “the
candles that are being hidden
under blankets.” We can find
shaded criticism of Davidson's
way of life in the 1930's. Wheth-
er from indirect pressure or
from the editors’ super-sensitive
feelings of propriety, however,
the editorial column remained
silent on administration and

faculty policy.

There was miid protest when
the college abolished the music
and fine arts department in
1931. There was a demand for a
new college church.

The amount of space given to
these issues made an Open
Letter to Censors, Oct. 24, 1934,
even more dramatic. It was
made clear that “THE DAVID-
SONIAN assumes no responsi-
bility for any sentiments em-
bodied in this article.

“We have an undeniable right
to decide for ourselves in the
pages of this paper whether or
not we shall subscribe to the
accredited conventions of a con-
temporary culture,” said the
1934 article.

The next week, editor K. D.
Weeks acknowledged that “ad-
verse criticism” was not pub-
lished in THE DAVIDSONIAN
since “there are .. . limitations
placed upon freedom of expres-
sion in the. columns of this

paper.”

Is Newspaper Tradition

BY B. MILLNER
Editer, 1960-41
This newspaper is burden-

ed with a motto.

Since 1956, THE DAVID-
SONIAN has been published
with the legend, “The News
and Editorial Voice of Da
vidson College” printed un-
der its nameplate. And at
least once every year since

minority stand which oppon-
ents have denounced as in-
consistent with the motto of
the paper.

“The majority of Davidson
stuylents don’t agree with
you, so you're not really be-
ing the editorial voice of
Davidson College,” they pro-
test. Po ek
NO IMPLICATION

There is nothing in the
motto that concretely implies
any obligation to print the
majority opinion of those
connected with Davidson Col-
lege.

Instead, the phrase states
only that this newspaper is
the publication issued by the
college that concerns itself
with news and editorial mat-
ter. After all, is there any
other publication on the
campus whose purpose is to
present current news and
editorial opinion?

In grammatical terms, the
word of is the trouble maker.
Of, upon superficial exami-
nation, may be taken to mean
representation. A preposition
more indicative of the real
implication of the motto is
in. An ideal expression of the
precise meaning, therefore,
is “The News and Editorial
Voice in Davidson College.”
This implies location rather
than representation — but

First, THE DAVIDSONIAN
is not a polling service. It
would be ludicrous for us to
seek a mandate from the stu-
dent body each week before
we write our editorials. Pol-
ling is expensive and time-
consuming.

Second, as an editor of the
Wake Forest Old Geld and
Bleck once put it, the news-
paper is not a corporation.
Just because a portion of the
expenses for THE DAVID-
SONIAN are paid out of the
general activity fee doesn't
entitle every student to be
an editor. We welcome any-
one’s opinion and his criti-
cism, but beyond that he can
mind his own business. He
pays only for the right to
read the paper, not for the
right to determine what goes
into it.

OPEN TO ALL .

Third, THE DAVIDSON.
IAN doesn't print just one
side of an issue. We have a
considerable amount of space
on the editorial page open to
anyone who would like to
disagree with us. If he is
literate enough, we will even
let our opponent write a
column in disagreement. This
latter offer is an oppurtunity
offered by few newspapers,
but few people here have

other . . . But to say that the
editorial page is slanted is
an. inane observation. It's
supposed to be slanted. And
the clearer the position the
better.”

This is our stand. We are
entrusted with the responsi-
bility to report the news as

» we see and hear it and to

comment on the news as we
see fit. If we can prick com-
placency’s balloon or take
a swipe at blind predudice,
we hope we'll have the cour-
age to do it.

If we are wrong, we take
full responsibility. In 20
years, we may look back and
marvel at how we jousted at
windmills. But for the pres-
ent, we think we're right and
we'll put it in print.

In the Oct. 20, 1937 issue, the
staff made public the faculty
censorship rules of the campus
paper. There were five:

1. There must be no deroga-
tory or embarrassing reference
to members of the faculty or
student body in jest, cartoon, or
otherwise.

2. No profanity or obscenity
or anything bordering on the
profane or obscene will be per-
mitted.

3. Vices that may at any time
be prevalent in the student body
must not be advertised or parad-
ed before the public by direct
or indirect reference thereto.

4. Nothing can enter any pub-
lication that the faculty com-
mittee in charge does not con-
sider to be for the best interest
of the college. If there is any
item criticizing the college, its
policies, or administration, such
items must be submitted to the
chairman of the faculty commit-
tee in charge.

5. The Editor-in-Chief and the
Business Manager will be held
directly responsible for all ma-
terial published and for the en-
forcement of the above regu-
lations.

We can only infer that the
student body accepted these
regulations.

In July, 1944, a box on the
editorial page proclaimed, ‘‘This
paper is the official history of
college life and is a medium of
student and faculty opinion. As
such it welcomes any contribu-
tion to it, provided such does

not contain derogatory -refer.
ence to faculty or students, pro.
fanity, obscenity, or destructive
criticism.”

This note ran until Sept. 1947,
when printing the paper became
a local operation.

The gradual growth ‘toward
greater student expression has
been reflected in THE DAVID.
SONIAN. By 1952 John Ottley
could write of the editor's re.
sponsibility under a free press.
However, he noted, “It is con.
ceivable how in an isolated case
an administrative veto might it-
self approach the state of being
license while ostensibly devoted
to the purpose of preventing the
school paper's freedom from
exceeding its bounds.”

The issue in 1952 was the
creation of a Student-Faculty
Conference Committee, which

not solved then, nor, probably,
will it ever be.

By 1954 THE DAVIDSONIAN
had assumed most of its modern
characteristics. Editor Henry
Brockmann, indignant over fai)-
ure of the trustees to increase
athletic subsidization in the face
of student demand, wrote:

“THE DAVIDSONIAN, ‘the
news and editorial voice of the
college,’ is recognized by those
who work for it as a free press,
independent of close supervision
and able to support anything
that is within the bounds of
good taste and reason.”

Every Editor's Albatross:

}, Chasing Campus Pidgeons

Davidsonian Associate Editor

“A pidgeon is a bird of dignity and of beauty, to be
treated with respect and even reverence.” In this earth-
moving editorial of 1943 and the furor it raised is continu-
ed all the dilemma and anxiety of effort and even, alas,

the pathos of occasional failure in t

possible chair behind THE DAVIDSONIAN editor’s desk.
