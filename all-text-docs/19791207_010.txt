10— The Davidsonian— December 7, 1979

Fido, etc. tops IMAC's top 10list

By BONEHEAD and
THE BRICK BROTHERS

Welcome to another week of
Bonehead and the Brick Bro-
thers. This week’s feature is a
tribute to a group of athletes
that have received so ‘little print
from The Davidsonian. The
team is the Florida State Semi-
noles. This college football team
powerhouse is 11-0 and headed
to the Orange Bowl.‘Coached by
Bobby Bowden ad led on
offense by several ‘Leon High
School standouts, thé tribe has
a passing attack that can strike
faster than a pack of Muslims in
front of ‘an American embassy.
By the way, Bonehead’s from
Florida

Ron’ Simmons asked that B
and BB mention his name. Ron
is a 6'2”, 230-pound noseman
from Warner Robbins, Georgia,
who can benchpress 550 pounds
and run the 40 in 4.4. Not at the
same time of course. Brett
Storm, a temptuous young
Jewish boy who worships Billy
Sims, says the the Oklahoma
Sooners will be in trouble on
New Year’s Day. You are so
right Brett!

In conclusion, we would like
to point out that Florida State
beat Oklahoma in the 1965
Gator Bowl. There are many
new faces on the present teams,
but this really doesn’t matter.

Now for the B& BB Preseason
Top Ten:

1. Fido and the Rearentries.
This team has a, disgusting
name that is appropriate for
their fraternity. Although the
name is bad,
stacked with talent. Andy
ImacDonald has recovered from
an early bout with disease that
kept him from lettering on

_ Coach Eddie’s team this year.

Forward Danny Hock chews
bubble gum and hits from the
corner while occasionally drop-
ping shorts to the delight of the
fans. At guard is senior star
Locke White, a fantastic shoot-
er and a perapatetic passer.
Susan Casper will replace grad-
uated starter Adrian Pantley.
Fido should be the best this
year unless they get too cocky.
One warning to opponents: this
team loves to go backdoor.

2. Cool Breeze. Last Year’s
champions have a name that
reminds Bonehead of the last
time he forgot to zip up. The
Breeze-is led by, laconic James
‘**Windex"’ McLain who snatch-
es rebounds with the same
voraciousness as that which he
eats children. By adding token
whites Craig Finger and Jimmy
Matson, it is clear that if this
team is taken hostage these two

guys will be among the last’

released. Alvin ‘Atkinson. and
Micky Dillon: are the best salt
and 93:96 combination in the

This team “is probably growaly ”

overrated butdue to a flip of the
coin in Réth’s Med. Soc. class
the writers decided to put them
here. The starting seven listed
alphabetically are: J. Riser, B.

the team is:

Hatcher, A, Smith, Stork, R.
Hull, S. Reuning, and M.
Schaeter. Ask Andy MacDon-
ald about his brother Stork and
you will be impressed with the
young freshmints credentials.
Many of these players can be
seen in morning volleyball ses-
sions. Thank you.

4. Hurtin 4 Certin. Another
strong contender that is head-
quartered at the Booty Palace.
They are led by shooting guard

* Minor Sinclair who has recently

participated in a Cincinnati
ritual in which :the natives
indulge in mass quantities of
alcohol followed by wrestling
and the ceremonial giving up of
the grits.

New members Joe “‘brick ass
’. Ford and Sandy Donald have
been added to the roster but did
not make the team photograph.
Other members who might help
are Richard, Eddie, Joby, and
Vince who were last seen at a
rompin, stompin, Who concert
in Cincy. This last sentence was
sick, but we included it for the
mentally ill who read our col-
umn.

5. Old Men. These guys never
get the ink that they deserve.

6. Brick Layers. Thought
that we might be attracted to
their name, but they were
wrong. This should be a great
team. The only problem is that
star Rand Malone roomed with
Turly Howard freshman year.
Turly’s that short-haired hall
counselor on First Belk. He is a
psychology major and someday
hopes to be a shrink. He likes
lots of freshmen girls and a few
like him. He’ll like you, too, if
you like him back. Turly let-
tered in flickerball this year
with Longitudinal Forces. He’s
a real good guy and he is not a
homosexual like many of the
people in California: You can
visit Turly on holidays in
Memphis, Tennessee.

7. We Know We’re Pathetic.
May be underrated but they
haven’t proven themselves in
any games yet. Hill Stockton,
Ricky Dominick, and Kevin
Wheeelak form the heme group
of this structure. The big ques-
tion rests in a player who was

recruited from the local com-
munity. His name is Derek the
Janitor. Hill says, ‘Derek can
jam.” We have scouted Derek
and know that if team members
can convinee him when he is hot
and when he is not then they
should do OK. Better name for
this team would be the ‘Peri-
patetics.”’

8. ICEF. Name resembles the
third line of the eye chart at
Charlotte Eye, Ear, Nose,
Throat, Arm, Leg‘ Foot Hospi-
tal. A freshmint team with
promise. Phil Gordon got 16
rebounds on the outdoor courts
Saturday afternoon.

9. True Grits. Another neo-
phyte team. Ken Craig is from
the Buckeye State which is
better than being from Alaba-
ma. A guy named Hall is a lot
better than older brother Bill

Barnett. Hall’s last name is.

Barnett, too. Neither can talk.
Their sister is beautiful but in
France. Ed Whitesides reminds
many observers of Wes Unseld
even though he is not big,
black, or good. Hall counselor
Dave Waddill will anchor the
team.

10. Guns Of Navarone. With
Zurbruegg, Porter, and Griffen
in the lineup, the supply of
basketballs may not be able to
keep up with the demand. Have
a guy named Marvin Webster
but he is not related to the
Human Eraser. Women’s bas-
ketball coach Palmer ‘‘Bull-
winkle’’ Muench may get a
rebound or two. by Christmas.
Rusty ‘‘Wop”’ Colechia is look-
ing forward to a big season but
still needs to work on his
English. Cora Nelson missed
the first three practices and
has been axed from the lineup.

That concludes our Top Ten
A-League teams. We wish that
we could do a sketch of the top
B-League and Women League
teams but there is not enough
space. If you are on a really
good B-League team please do
not come to us begging for print
because you should be playing
A-League. In the Women’s
League the team to watch is the
Ka-o-las coached by W.H.
Later.
