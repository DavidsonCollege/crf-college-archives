Hood Addresses
Ministerial Band

The Ministerial Band held a very inter-
esting and informative meeting last Sun-
day at the usual hour. Dr. Frazer Hood
was the speaker of the evening and made
a fine talk, taking as his subject “The
Practical Side of being a Preacher.” He
discussed his subject under three heads
which included (1) the necessity of dress-
ing appropriately, (2) the necessity of
knowing how to outline Scripture, and (3)
the necessity of knowing how to select
appropriate hymns for all occasions. Dr.
Hood’s discussion was enjoyed very much
by the large-number of members and vis-
itors present. ‘

Davidson Spanish Club
Has Important Meeting

Be
i

Tuesday night at 8:30, the Spanish Club
held a very important meeting in Shear-
er Hall. After all business had been set-
tled, delightful refreshments were served
to the members. W. L. Hart,
over the meeting.

Most important among the matters dis-

ganization with a similar society of na-
tional standing. Despite the fact that no|
definite move has been made to this end, |
it is very probable that such an affiliation
will take place. It is highly desired by
most of the members and would surely
mean much to the college in general,

In the very near future a new set of
officers will be elected for the coming
term, The present officers are: W. L.
Hart, President; J. K. Pepper, Vice-Pres-
ident; and A. G. Randolph, Secretary-
Treasurer.

Varsity Basketeers
Not Unusually Tall

None of the players on the varsity bas-
ketball team are endowed with unusual
heights, the tallest man being “Boots”
Wilson, center, who is 6 feet 3 inches tall,
but he is not one of the regular first
stringers. Captain Johnston is the only
starter in games, who is over 6 feet, and
he is 6 feet 1 inch, which fact has proved
itself to be a great help in the recent con-
tests. Gilbert, who is frequently substi-
tuted, is of a similar height to John-
ston, while the only other 6-foot members
are Rusk and Milton. These’ two men al-
ternate as regular center for the Wild-
cats.

Pritchett, high scorer so far this season,
and top-notcher in the scoring column
last winter, when he was captain, is the
smallest man on the squad. Several of the

Wills Francis T. Hunter, United

French Mixed Doubles—Eileen Bennett,

National Intercollegiate Singles—Berk-
ley Bell, University of Texas.

jamin Gorchakoff and Arthur Kussman,

Wildcat Cagers Win
Over Wofford Quint

Wednesday, January 8, 1930, saw the
Davidson Wildcats sweep the Wofford
Terriers aside in a 29 to 15 victory. The
game was played in the new Andrews
| Memorial field house at Wofford College,
land was witnessed by a large crowd—
this game being the dedication of the
field house. Davidson took an early lead
in the game and kept ahead throughout
the remainder of the contest.

Although Wofford played an extraor-
dinarily good defensive game, the Wild-
cats were not to be stopped. The battle
was featured throughout by well-timed
and well-directed shots from Pritchett,
who piled up a total score of fifteen points.
On the whole, Wofford showed up best

i lin defensive tactics, while Davidson was
presided |

undoubtedly at her best in the offensive.
Neither team was able to break through

the opposing defense with any consistency

cussed was the affiliation of the local or- and the marksmen of ‘both teams were

|forced to depend upon long shots for a
| good part of their scoring. The floor and
defensive play of Captain Jeffries of Wof-
ford, and Proctor of Davidson, featured.

aspirants hover around the 6-foot height,
such as Goodson, Proctor, and Martin,
but the remaining number are well under
that. Mathis is another small-man on
the team, being approximately the same
height as Pritchett, white Moore and
Shepherd come in between these men.

Lingle Reports To
Board of Trustess

At a meeting of the executive commit-
tee of the board of trustees held last ‘
Thursday in Charlotte at the office of
Mr. R. A. Dunn, Dr. W. L. Lingle gave a
“very satisfactory” report of the year’s
work,

Only “routine” matters were discussed.
The meeting was called earlier than is
customary in order to attend to matters
of business.

Plans for the mid-winter meeting of
the board of trustees were made at the
gathering. The board is due to meet here
February 19, The executive committee
usually meets the day before the trustees
meet, but it was held more than a month
earlier thi§ year in order to discuss finan-
cial matters and to hear Doctor Lingle’s
report.

Plans for a new athletic building and
training house for the college were dis-
cussed, but nothing definite about it was
made public.

Old Gold Features
New Series of Ads

John Held, Jr., Wields a Wicked Pen
For Old Gold Cigarettes

Those of our so-called student body who
fancy themselves in the roles of Lotharios,
handsome ne’er-do-wells and old-fash-
ioned heroes of romance, will do well to
study the helps and hints contained in
Mr. John Held, Jr.’s series of Old Gold
advertisements now appearing this paper.

. The inimitable Held object lessons in

successful courtship are among the fun-
niest things we have ever seen in print.
That they should appear as sales per-
suaders for Old Golds subtracts nothing
whatever from their funniness.

We make no bones about the fact that
any advertisement in our columns gives
us something of a thrill. Business is busi-
ness even to a college newspaper—but
when an advertiser gives us his money
and a hearty laugh to boot, we feel like .
we are playing the game on the velvet.

Long may John Held continue to por-
tray his melodramatic villains and touch-
me-not maidens of long ago. And may his
heroes and heroines never find a cough
in a carload!

Rastus: “Here is a telegram from de
boss in Africa. He says he is sending us
some lions’ tails.”

Circus Owner’s Wife: “Lions’ tails,
Rastus? What are you talking about?”

Rastus: “Well, read it yourself. It say
plain: “Just captured two lions. Sending
details by mail.”
