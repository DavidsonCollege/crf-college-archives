Clapton oscillates between

By RUSELL CARTER

By looking objectively at Eric
Clapton’s music and career, one
could generalize that it is
characterized by two essential
styles, one being calm and
spiritual; the other flashy and
dynamic. In his best music
these elements are in harmony,
complementing each other.

A good example of one of his
successful songs is ‘‘Presence
of the Lord” first recorded for
the Blind Faith album and later
released on the live Derek and
the Dominoes and Rainbow con-
cert albums.

The song begins with mellow
chords and the words “I have
finally found a way to live, in
the presence of the Lord.””

Spiritual peak
The song builds slowly
reaching a musical and

spiritual peak at which point
Clapton unleashes a classic,
power-packed, wah-wah lead
which eventually unwinds down
to a peaceful refrain.

When either of the important
elements in Clapton’s style
becomes’ excessive, the
resultant music suffers.

In his early days, when he
played with the Yardbirds,
Mayall’s Blues Breakers, and
Cream, (when fans scribbled
“Clapton is God’’ on walls
thorughout Europe), Clapton
established a reputation as an

obsessive and flashy,

technically flawless rock and

He was, at times, however,

criticized for playing endless in-
strumental riffs which were at
first impressive, but became
boring. They lacked spirit and
inspiration.

A heartbreaking affair with
George Harrison’s ex-wife ap-
parently provided the
necessary inspiration for Clap-
ton’s true masterpiece: the
double set “‘Layla’’ album. In
addition, the highly talented
session men (including Duane
Allman) sparked Eric to cook
like he had never done before.

Hard-core rock

The album is a brilliant com-
bination of hard-core rocking
(such as ‘‘Tell the Truth’) and
subtle mood music (like
‘*Thorn-tree in the Garden’’).

The title song “‘Layla’’ em-
bodies all that is good about the
album and the musician in
general. Thie first half is a

Clapton suffered through a dif-
ficult period in his life. Ap-
parently he could not solve his

personal _ problems, and
i ironically his tour with Derek
and the Dominoes did not stir

the enthusiasm which it was
certainly due

At this point Clapton disap-
peared from public view and
turned to the sometimes
pleasant distraction of heroin.

This phase in his life lasted
for three years, being brought
to an end by dwindling funds
and electro-acupuncture.

flashy, calm

released two.new albums, ‘‘46)
Ocean Boulevard”’ and
‘“‘There’s one in every crowd.”’

The abums are similar in that
they both represent. Clapton's
spiritual and mellow style, and
they are both very inconsistent

“There’s one in every crowd’’
was just released last month.

The first two songs on the
album ‘‘We’ve been told (Jesus
Coming Soon)’’ and “Swing
Low Sweet Chariot,’’ are
disasters. They are both
traditional religious songs
played with basic chordal ac-
companiment.

One can’t avoid wondering
why Clapton has __ stooped to
these songs, when he was once
able to write an original
religious song like ‘‘Presence of
the Lord.”

Two blues tunes, (an Elmore
James and a Jim Byfield) are
contained on side one as well. If
Clapton is intent on curbing his
famous flashy leads; he should
certainly avoid old blues
classics. He never plays more
than basic chords on these.

‘Little Rachael”’

At the beginning of “‘Little
Rachael’’ Clapton sings ‘If
your down here’s’ what to
do/hear my guitar sing to you.”
For the remainder of the song,
one is left wondering when the
old ’57 Strat is going to come
blistering in. It never does.

The other song on the side is
“‘Don’t Blame Me” which is a
sequel to ‘“‘I Shot the Sheriff.’’ If
you liked the up-tempo song
from ‘‘461’’ -you’ll like this as
well. The songs are similar.

The second side of ‘‘There’s
one in every crowd”’ is an im-
provement over side one. The
last four tunes are all new Clap-
ton compositions and they are
all emotionally performed
songs.

There is a_ discernable
Beatles influence in this new
music. ‘‘Better Make it

\ Through the Day’’ sounds very
imilar to Harrison’s ‘‘Far East
Man.”’

‘Pretty, Blue Eyes” contains
beautiful Beatle-like
background vocal harmonies,
and ‘High’? and ‘Opposites’
have ‘slide guitar parts which
sound exactly like Harrison’s
slide work since “All Things
Must Pass.”’

Flashy Clapton

On the back cover of the new
album an exuberant Clapton is
pictured raising his hands in
triumph to what must have
been an appreciative crowd
response. It’s the flashy Clapton
whose presence is missing in
his last two releases.

On the front of the abum is a
picture of an incredible wasted
looking dog with classic junkie
eyes.

If this is how Clapton feels
as of late, we can expect more
laid-back music from him (if he
continues to survive in his post
addiction days).

Clapton has always played
best with musicians who
challenge him. I don’t think his
low-key music will improve un-
til he gets together with top-
notch musicians who play
music of this type.

The studio guitarist «George
Terry) and pianist (Dick Sim-
ms) on the last two albums play
insignificant roles. Replace
them with, say Harrison and
Bobby Whitlock, and I think
Clapton could once again be at
the top of the rock guitar scene.
