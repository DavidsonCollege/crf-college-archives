DCPC ‘prank’ in fact big
corporate marketing deal

“We just love
Gordon, ”’ say
church leaders

DCPC—Wanting to dispel all myths that it
might have been a student prank, the
leaders of DCPC confirmed yesterday that
the placement of a NASCAR logo on the
northern face of the church clock repre-
sents a contractual agreement of corpo-
rate sponsorship. Davidson College Pres-
byterian Church is now a proud NASCAR
bankroller. :

“Everyone’s got this all wrong,” said
head church elder Joseph Kennedy. “This
was not some kid’s prank. DCPC is now
an official NASCAR sponsor, just like
Budweiser or Wheaties or whatever. We
have a need for speed. Why is this so hard
for people to accept?”

The events leading to the decision to
financially underwrite the National Asso-
ciation for Stock Car Auto Racing were set
into place early this year, when church
leaders witnessed a slow but steady de-
cline in attendance at Sunday services.
After taking a vote, the DCPC governing
counsel concluded that funding NASCAR
and endorsing a racing team would be the
best way to “get our name out there.”

Other suggestions included having the
organist take requests, encouraging even
more insincere smiling, and improving
the weather on Sundays.

With church elders in full support of
the sponsorship, the new plan was an-
nounced to parishioners at the 11:00 Sun-
day service on January 18, whereupon ev-
eryone stared giving high fives and yelling
“Boogity, Boogity, Boogity!” The congre-
gation then retreated to the church hall to

Inspired by the excitement, Kennedy
went to Wal-Mart later that afternoon and
bought a NASCAR racing flag to hang
behind the bell tower clock face. Recent
attempts to blame the idea on ‘some kid’
have come as a disappointment to the
tenured church leader. “I put that thing
up there myself,” said Kennedy, a retired
real estate agent and life-long Davidson

The recent display of a NASCAR
racing flag behind the northern

many as a student prank. It was in
fact nothing of the sort.

resident. “Damn near broke my back. Just
ask my wife Ethel, she was holding the
ladder and yelling at me the whole time I
was doing it.”

Unfortunately, the omen would not be
long lived. “Yeah, the administration said
we had to take it down,” said Kennedy,
referring to the college’s protestations
that the logo was “cheapening our image.”
“Man, those poopers never let anyone
have any fun.”

Despite the disappointment over hav-
ing to take down their neat flag, DCPC
remains deeply dedicated to the NASCAR
advertising venture. In addition to putting
up nearly $15 million of parishioners’
money, the church has also offered a
number of auxiliary ecclesiastical ser-
vices, such as helping out with weddings
at nearby Lowe’s Motor Speedway.

For the moment, Kennedy just can’t
wait to get team DCPC off to the races.
“Winning’s about more than just knowing
how to get the maximum horsepower out
of an engine starved by restrictor plates,”
said Kennedy. “It’s also about faith—and
faith is what we at DCPC are all about.
That and roof flaps. We'll see you punks at
Daytona.”

Dear Online Personal Ad:

My roommate is driving me nuts! She
must have lied on that roommate profile
or something because we are nothing
alike. She sleeps during the day and won’t
let me play music or type on the com-
puter, but at night invites friends over
while I’m trying to get some rest. I’m be-
ginning to think she may be a vampire. Is
it time to test my theory by hammering a
stake through her heart?

Dear Online Personal Ad:

I’ma second semester junior and I just
discovered that I hate my major! I
thought I wanted to go to med school, but
if I have to dissect one more piece of
roadkill I think I might just jump in front
of a car myself. How can I break it to my
parents that I’m switching to Philosophy
and becoming an unemployed deep
thinker instead?
