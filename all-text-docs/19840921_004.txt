New Faculty Members Come To Davidson

Professors Stott
And Stough

By CHRIS FISHER

Professor Mary F. Stough, a part-
time professor in the English Department
this year, was born in Davidson and has
kept close ties with the college and facul-
ty for many years.

Stough will teach one course of En-
glish Composition I, which she also
teaches at UNC-Charlotte. She worked
at Davidson in the early 1960s as an Ad-
ministrative Assistant to Shaw Smith,
former Director of the Union.

Stough has taught freshman English

since 1963. Before arriving at UNCC in -

1978 she taught at Atlanta Christian Col-
lege and UNC-Chapel Hill.

Stough received her A.B. and
Ph. D. at the University of South
Carolina, and earned her M. A. at Ap-
palachian State. Her major interest is

18th century British literature, and she
plays bridge and reads murder mysteries
in her spare time.

She said she is glad to be teaching at
Davidson and appreciates the college’s
friendliness toward new faculty. She is,
however, disappointed that Davidson re-
quires only one unit of English for gradu-
ation. “Since Davidson is a noted liberal
arts school, I think every student would
want to take at least two courses in En-
glish,” she said.

After one week of teaching, Stough is
impressed by her students: “The students
are interesting and stimulating and lazy

at times,” she said.
Professor Douglass Stott

Although this is Professor Douglass
Stott’s first year of teaching at Davidson,
he has taught Davison students for the
past three years.

Stott was the professor coordinating
Davidson’s junior year abroad program
in Marburg, Germany. This year he will
teach Introduction to German Literature
— 19th century — and Elementary Ger-
man I. Professor Mark McCulloh is now
the JY A coordinator in Marburg.

Stott said the years in Germany were
a unique teaching experience. “Directing
JYA in Marburg and teaching at David-
son are two different ballgames. The
JY A experience is more intense and con-

centrated. There’s more to distract [stu-
dents] here,” he said.

At Marburg, Stott taught a class on
German civilization and held a seminar
on the German philosopher Nietzsche,
which he particularly enjoyed. “It was
one of the most enjoyable teaching and
learning experiences I’ve ever had,” he
said.

Stott graduated from Davidson in
1970 and feels that the character of the
college has changed little. “Davidson has

pretty much the same atmosphere of
friendliness. One gets the same feeling
walking around campus,” he said.

Stott has an M. A. and Ph. D. from
Northwestern and an M.T.S. from
Emory University. He has worked as a
copy editor for the John Knox Press and
as a freelance translator for various
theological presses. Stott also taught
evening German classes at Emory. His
hobbies include swimming and playing
the piano.

Professors Hart
And Frietag

By SHANE MEEKS

Professor Thomas Hart is a new
member of the Economics department.
Hart came to Davidson because of its size
and academic reputation. :

Hart earned his B. A. from Ameri-
can University in 1970, his M. A. from
Duke in 1982, and is now completing his
Ph. D. at Duke. Before coming to
Davidson, Hart taught part time at Amer-
cian University. He also worked in the
forestry service at Duke.

Hart considers Davidson “the ideal
school to be at.” He also said he enjoys
the town because it reminds him of the
town he grew up in. Hart, who is en-
gaged to be married, enjoys bass fishing,
fly fishing, and flying gliders.

Professor Ruth Frietag

Professor Ruth Frietag begins her
first year in the Chemistry department
this fall.

Frietag has been particularly im-
pressed with the level of the students she
has met and with the responsibilities
Davidson places on its students.

She presently teaches a three-term

course in experimental methods. The
course has never had a professor to teach
it throughout the whole year. Frietag said
she wants to use this opportunity to inte-
grate the course more than was possible
in the past. She would also like to set up
her own research program in the near fu-
ture.

Outside of the lab, Frietag, who plans
to marry soon, enjoys photography,
clogging, folk music, hiking, cross-
country skiing, and her two dogs.

She obtained her B.S. degree -in
chemistry from Bucknell, and her Ph. D.
in Inorganic chemistry from the Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Frietag completed three semesters of
graduate school work as a teaching assis-
tant while at Chapel Hill.

Professors Foley
And DeLaura

By CHANDAN SINHA

“It’s really incredible. I’ve never
seen an Honor System of this kind work-
ing so well anywhere. It is a model pro-
gram,” new art Professor Pamela De-
Laura said. She finds Davidson a refresh-
ing change. According to DeLaura, the
various departments are well-integrated
and there is a great deal of exchange of
information among them.

DeLaura feels that the warmth of the
people makes Davidson unique. “People
from-passing cars wave at you.”

Originally from Eirie, Pa., DeLaura
majored in fine arts at Buffalo State Col-
lege and got her M. A. in Print Making
from the Tyler School of Art at Temple
University. Attracted by its “strong” art
faculty and high academic standards,

DeLaura came to Davidson via the Col-
lege Art Convention. Though she finds
her students receptive and industrious,
she said, “they appear to be more worried
about their grades than art. They seem to
be nervous when they walk into a studio
class.”

Apart from her work and teaching,
DeLaura finds time to pursue many inter-
ests. She enjoys reading, and considers
J. D. Salinger and Flannery O’Connor
her favorite authors. She is interested in
Mexican Retablos and in the study of
family relationships, which she says is
the motivating factor in her work.

In February she plans to give an
exhibition of her works in the Chamber
Art Gallery.

Professor Trent Foley

Professor Trent Foley, the latest ad-
dition to the Religion Department, has a
variety of interests, including computer
mathematics, bridge, and simply “wast-
ing time.”

Foley has a B. A. in Mathematics
from Kalamazoo College in Michigan.
His change in interests from mathematics
to religion occurred in England, where
he spent his junior year studying com-
puter mathematics at Reading Univer-
sity. He realized he did not particularly
enjoy concentrating on mathematics.
However, he did enjoy visiting cathed-
rals. After earning his B. A., he joined
the University of Chicago and earned his
Ph. D. in the History of Christianity
from the Divinity School.

He likes Davidson. very much and
likes the students even more. “‘They are
very bright and receptive and even inter-
ested,” he said. Foley is particularly im-
pressed by the Honor Code which, he
said makes for an “open, trustful atmos-
phere” not only on campus but also in the
town of Davidson.

Come Christmas there will be a new
voice among Davidson’s choral singers;
singing is one, of Foley’s favorite inter-
ests.
