A few facts about tanning and the
sun in general from a Californian
beach bum who has finally learned
her lesson:

1) Asunburn does not look good.
People say, “Look atthatidiot who
fried herself.” The color purple
does not become human skin.

2) If you burn so badly that you:

-blister

-feel like every part of your
body has an intense fever

-can’t sleep at night because
you’re in so much pain

-illicit sympathy from every-
one who sees you,
then DO NOT SUNBATHE. It
takes one bad sunburn to get mela-
noma (a serious form of skin can-
cer) later in life. If you burn easily
and have to spend time in the sun,
use sunblock. For very fair people,
the highest SPF is the best. You
won’t get tan anyway and the
sunblock will save you fromabum.

3) When you’re out in the sun and
someone says, “You look like
you're getting burnt”, GET OUT
OF THE SUN. At this point,
you’re in trouble. Sunburns don’t
usually appear until a couple of

hours after you’ve finished tan-
ning. If you are already getting
burnt and you continue to sun-
bathe, the sun has probably infil-
trated your brain as

well.

tissues than the UVB light that
causes burns. Salons stake their
claims regarding a “safe tan” upon
the fact that you won’t burn or
peel. Meanwhile, the
rays are weakening

not normally get

extra lotion on
these places.

your immune. sys-
tem. People on birth
control or antibiot-
ics such as tetracy-
cline are in particu-
lar danger of thisand
burns from their time
in the bed.

Also, contrary to
popular belief, a
tanning bed tan does
not protect you from
the sun. The type of
tan that provides a
protective layer
against overexpo-
sure is derived from

melanoma, dehy-

dration. The summer before last, a
girl in Arizona laid out so long in
hundred degree weather that she
literally fried to death.

6) If you have any further ques-
tions or concerns, see a dermatolo-
gist. He or she can give you advice
about tanning and skin care in
general.

fake bake. The tanning bed has

been with us for little more than a

decade, so long term effects can
only be speculated about at this
point. _
However, the medical commu-
nity isn’t exactly waving banners
about the short term effects of the
hot box. Today T-beds utilize light
bulbs emitting UVA lights. These
waves penetrate deeper into the

UVB exposure, not

UVA exposure.
However, if you do find your-
self addicted to the scan tan, be
aware of the most important dan-
ger: your eyes. Wear the goggles.
Closing your eyes is not sufficient
protection against the rays. Cata-
ract formation in the eyes of those
who utilize tanning beds is a sig-
nificant danger, with results not
showing up until perhaps a decade

later; that’ s cataracts at thirty.
Also, if you are going to tan in
the bed, don’t double up with out-
door exposure. A guy in Alabama
wentoutin the sun foranhourorso _
after having gone to the tanning
bed and suffered severe epidermal
damage--the entire outer layer of

_his skin peeled off, threatening his

life.

Since the tan is so much a part
of what we view as a healthy, vital
look, I don’t foresee our genera-
tion evolving to the point where
we don’t desire one. Toaccommo-
date this craving, perhaps the best
option these days is the bottle o’
tan. Unlike the tanning pills you
ingest that dye your skin (and have
been dubbed a possible carcino-
gen), tanning creams react with
your skin to give the appearance of
a tan by working with your mela-
nin, not by dying the surface.

Estee Lauder has three different
shades that will free you forever
from sun-damage. But whatever
route you decide to take, throw on
some protection, get out to the lake
campus, and enjoy these last lin-
gering daysof indian summer while
you can--the sun is still good for
the psyche. |
