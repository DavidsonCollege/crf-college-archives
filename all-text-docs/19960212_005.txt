This past week, Davidson
joined other colleges and institu-
tions nationwide to promote
awareness of eating disorders.

Organized by the Student
Counseling Center, National Eat-
ing Disorders Week consisted of
two organized gatherings and free
screening at the counseling cen-
ter throughout the week.

Monday night, students and
faculty joined together in the
Carolina Inn this seminar to hear
three students’ personal accounts
of past experiences with eating
disorders. Many attended to gain
a larger understanding of the is-
sue and to learn how tohelp friends
and loved ones who suffer from

sions.

National Eating Awareness Week
Professors and students speak about healthy
leating, media images, and increasing your
self-esteem in today's look- conscious world

trayal of women in advertising.

“The Very Skinny Woman in
the Very Expensive Clothes: Im-
ages of Women in Advertising”
review a series of slides of adver-
tisements in popular magazines,
from People to Glamour, that ex-
emplify the media’s enforcement
and exploitation of women’s bod-
ies.

“Tt’s about the thin body that
sells expensive clothes .:. Sex sells
clothes, there’s no question about
it,” said Serebrennikov.

According to Serebrennikov,
suggestive advertisements glori-
fying thin, androgenous trimlines
pose dangerous threats to the es-
teem and self-image of a predomi-
nately female audience.

She emphasized the univer-
sality of the effects of such adver-
tising as targeting all age groups
“to the grave.”

Handouts were available at
both presentations giving guide-
lines for preventing bad eating de-
cisions and confronting those who
struggle with them.

Health Educator Georgia
Ringle, coordinator of the week,
is excited and encouraged by the
response to the programs of the
week: “I was really pleased with
the response.”

A task group has been orga-
nized to further deal with the is-
sue of eating choices made by
Davidson students. “The more
this issue is brought to the fore-
front, the more people will seek
help,” says Ringle.

Dr. Dewitt Crosby, Psycholo-
gist at the Counseling Center, is
equally encouraged: “I think it’s
a testimony to how much this is
on people’s minds and how much
of a concern this issue is, and it’s
a testament to how much support
is there is on campus for people
who are struggling with this is-
sue.”

“T just hope the week touched
someone's life who was suffering
and will give them courage to
seek help,” says senior Morgan
Perry.

and he has “no regrets.”

Like Barton, Professor of
Physics and Humanities .Robert
Manning met his wife on a blind
date and immediately had strong
positive feelings about her. He
was a graduate student at the Uni-
versity of Virginia when he met his
wife-to-be.

One of his friends was dating
an instructor of nursing at UVA.
The friend and his girlfriend set
Manning up with one of her friends
(also an instructor of nursing) on a
blind date toa cookout. By the end
of the evening, Manning says, “I
was convinced that if I didn’t marry
her, I was a fool.”

They were married one year
later and have resided in Davidson
ever since. Manning says of his
marriage, “We have three wonder-
ful children and have been in love
for a whole bunch of years.”

Amore recent marriage is that
of Annie and Randy Ingram, both
of the English department. They
met in 1989 at a graduate school
potluck at Emory, but they were
friends for years before they dated.
This was “mostly because Randy
was always occupied by some other
woman,” according to Annie, but
Randy says, “that’s not true at all.”

In the summer of 1993 they
were reacquainted at a party. Annie
returned from a backpacking ex-
pedition tofind Randy a “free man.”
She says he had “wizened up,” but
he says he always thought she was
“too pretty and too smart and way
out of my league.” However, of
the night of the party, he says, “She
was flirting with me BIG time.”

But rather than asking her out

“like any normal person,” Annie
says, Randy decided to invite Annie
and a few friends over to make ice
cream and watch a movie,

“It was alla pretense,” he
says; he had to “lay low.” The
group got together the following
evening to watch another movie,
and the next day Annie found a
thank you note and a “little piece of
candy” in her mailbox.

She was so excited, until she
learned that-her friend Marsha re-
ceived the same.

Then there was what Annie
calls “the ill-fated birthday movie.”
Randy left another note in Annie’s
mailbox, this time asking her to a
movie for her birthday since he
could not attend her party. She
never got the note. Days later,
upon discovering Annie had not
received the invitation, Randy told
her of the note and invited her to
another movie.

They then went on what Annie
considers their first date, but what
Randy considers a friendly movie
outing. Afterwards, they went to
Annie’s house and talked for hours.
Of when he left, Annie says, “I
didn’t even getahug. I was hoping
for a goodnight kiss, but I got no
hug, no nothing.”

She thought he wasn’t inter-
ested. Until she woke up the next
morning and found a “major crush
note” taped to her front door. Randy
wrote it thinking that he would tell
herhow he felt and then they would
“deal with being friends.” Little
did he know, that less than two
years later they would be married.

Without a doubt, the story

- most resembling a fairy tale ro-

mance is that of Dr. Whitton, of the
mathematics department. He re-
members the exact date he met his
wife — Friday, September 8, 1978.
“Tt was late in the afternoon,” he
says, “and I was out riding my

horse when I noticed two guys in
an argument with a woman.”

He rode overto themand asked
if there was a problem. Whitton

only problem around here is you,
buddy,’ and at that moment the
light flashed off my armor and
blinded them. It was then that I
picked my wife up off the ground,
lifted her onto my horse, and we
rode off together into the sunset.”

Open forum addresses
new zero tolerance laws

By KirsTEN RECKNAGEL
Assistant News Editor

“T’m not here to give a lecture
[about the dangers of drinking and
driving],” Sergeant R. E. Medlin
of the North Carolina Highway
Patrol told his audience Wednes-

-day evening, “but to let you know

where you stand, what the laws
are, and how they affect you.”
Joined by Davidson’s Sub-
stance Abuse Counselor, Dr. Art
Flagg, and Sergeant David Harding
of the Campus Police in Chambers
Gallery Wednesday evening,
Medlin lead an open forum de-
signed to inform students about
North Carolina’s new state laws
concerning drinking and driving.
Medlin explained that under
the state’s recently passed legisla-

says, “Oni of the men repliéd,*The’ - tion, dubbed:the “Zero ‘Tolerance “af

Laws”, drivers who are under 21

years of age and are found to have

any trace of alcohol in their bodies
automatically lose their drivers li-
censes for a full year, with the
possibility of a DWI charge and
increased insurance premiums.
Any presence of open con-

tainers of alcohol in the passenger
areas of cars is illegal, regardless
of the age of the driver.
According to Medlin, most
fatalities resulting from alcohol
related car accidents are young
people. “What these laws are try-
ing to do is protect you,” he said.
State law not only attempts to
curb the problem of underage
drinking and driving by targeting
those drinkers under the age of 21
who are caught behind the wheel,
but by focusing on all age drinkers.
The consequences are steep if
individuals under 21 years are
caught attempting to purchase al-
cohol.
The offense may result in fines
of up to $500 and/or imprisonment

up to six months.
Individuals of legal drinking

hol for underage drinkers face even.
greater penalties, fines as high as
$2,000 and a prison term of up to
two years.

After summarizing the new
laws, Medlin answered a forum of
general questions from the audi-
ence.
