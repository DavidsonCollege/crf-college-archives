PREMIER IN WASHINGTON

Dr. T. W. Lingle to Address Club at
Regular Meeting Friday

On October 7 a telegram was wired to the
British Prime Minister James Ramsay Mac-
Donald from the International Relations
Club by S. R. Coker, President of the club.
This telegram was written in collaboration
with Dr. J. M. CeConnell, professor of his-
tory, and H. E. Russell, vice-president of
the club. The plan to send a telegram of
welcome to the British Prime Minister was
approved by the club in a meeting after
chapel on last Monday morning. The pur-
poses of the International Relations Club
in wiring Premier MacDonald were: (1)
To voice their deep interest in the efforts
now being made towards world peace by the
leaders in International Affairs. (2) To send
a warm and courteous greeting to the dis-
tinguished British visitor. (3) To extend
an invitation to this great man to visit
Davidson and to address the student hody
and friends of the college.

The telegram follows:

Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald,
The British Embassy,
Washington, D. C.

The International Relations Cluls of Dav-
idson College sincerely welcomes you to our
country.
World Brotherhood and Peace will come
neafer to realization. Human life sacrificed
to war must be saved and billions of money
wasted in strife should be used for internal
social and economic construction. May God
direct you and others to accomplish your
high purpose.

Excellent Prospect
For New Rifle Team

With only two members of last year's rifle
team absent from college this year, the pros-
pects for the team seem unusually good. One
hundred and one men turned out Monday

good material should be available.

Eighty correspondence matches are
duled for the season among these, contests
with the Gastonia Rifle Club, the team from
Kemper military school, and the Wall Street

Brown Analyzes State’s
Present Labor Problem

Professor of Economics Speaks Be-
fore Kiwanis Club of
Meoresvil)e

“Have done with Paternalism,” the
exhortation of Dr, Cecil K. Brown of David-
son’s Economics Department to a group of
leading business men of Mooresville who
gathered Friday night at the Kiwanis Club
of that city for their weekly dinner. Doctor
Brown was called upon for an almost im-
promptu address to the club, and he chose
to comment upon the tense labor problem of
North Carolina:

His speech on the whole was a clear-head-

was

ed observation of the labor uprisings in this
state, particularly in Gastonia and in Marion.
Doctor Brown had, occasion to parallel the
present outbreak of the laboring classes with
similar revolts in the North fifty years ago
and in England a year ago. He affirmed that
the situation is not new to the world, but new
to the capitalists and people of North Caro-
lina only,

“The communists of this section,”
Brown remarked, “are in no wise to be com-
pared with those in Russia’ Furthermore the
people of this state,” he continued, “would
hot want real communism if they saw it.
They seek merely a champion of their rights,
anyone: who will open the way to higher
wages. And therefore there is no real cause
for alarm in the persons of the communists.”

In the course of his talk, Doctor Brown
endeavored to accentuate four points. First
of all “the paternalistic attitude will never
solve the problem.” Doctor Brown cited the
case of Mr. Pullman, the sleeping-car mag-
nate, who furnished his émployees with all
possible comforts and needs. His disinterested
action, Doctor Brown said, was not appreci-
ated. The employees grumbled and com-
plained that their whole life was Pullman:
they slept in Pullman beds, ate in Pullman
dining-houses, went to Pullman churches, and
when they died, were buried in Pullman
graves. Doctor Brown observed that it was
quite evident, therefore, that the. paternal-

heen brightened by the news that Dan Goody-

able to play. Tom Brohard, fullback, will be
in condition for Saturday’s encounter, also.
The Clemson ‘Tiger contest left Brohard
with an injured leg, and he did not appear
in uniform for the Wofford game. “Borneo”
Baker, last year’s captain, and tackle,
also kept out of the Wofford game, in order
to be in good condition for the Army clash.

Extensive arrangements are being made
for the entertainment of the Red and Black
Machine after its battle with the Soldiers.
The members of the team will be guests of
honor at a dinner given by Dr. A. B. Reese,
who graduated from Davidson in 1917, Dr.
Reese, whose home was formerly in Char-
lotte, is one of the leaders in the medica!

Point.

As the team takes field against the Cadets,
the Davidson student body will be following
the game over the Play-O-Graph in the

A committee consisting of Bilt McGuire,
