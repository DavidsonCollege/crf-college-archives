A Break in the Case

After three years of deadlock, the
Curriculum Committee has brought forth
a concrete proposal for changing the out-
moded requirements for the AB and BS
degrees. The faculty will decide its fate
on Monday afternoon.

The Committee’s proposal goes, it
seems to us, straight to the heart of the
matter. Majors in mathematics and natur-
al sciences will receive the bachelor of
science degree: all others would receive
the arts degree.

What could be more logical and na-
tural? This proposition cuts through the
wrangling over the classical language re-
quirement, around which much of the
previous argument has revolved. Al-
though the basic- proposal is in fact un-
changed, the Committee’s approach adds
clarification and common sense to an
often confusing and garbled situation.

The other alternative which the faculty
will consider seems to us to be much less
desirable. While not as outlandish as the
present situation. a blanket AB degree to
every Davidson graduate, regardless of
field of study. is a mite foolish itself.

Most liberal arts colleges generally

recognize two degrees, one in the sciences,
and one in the arts or humanities. These
distinctions are accurate and meaning-
ful, and it would be unfortunate for the
Davidson degree to continue to carry an
inaceurate connotation, whether it be
with practically everyone getting a BS,
or with everyone receiving an AB.

In additon, .it seems safe to say that
in many cases, an AB degree would have
as little appeal for a chemistry major as
a BS degree has for a philosophy major
under the present system.

Both degrees will be made more mean-
ingful with the elimination of those who
do not logically fall into the respective
categories.

At any rate, it is heartening to see
action in the making. It is this very type
of response to student opinion that has
pulled student-faculty relations out of the
low-tide doldrums of a few years ago.

A decisive affirmative vote by the
faculty Monday on this proposal would
be, among other things, a vote of confi-
dence for the continual strengthening of
the warm and cordial rapport which now
exists.

Box Office Thwarts iTry{for Culture

Just when we were cultivating a happy
glow about the ever-increasing doses of
culture and entertainment available at
Charlotte’s out-of-this-world Coliseum-

Auditorium, we sustained a real kick in-

the teeth.

The Boston Pops’ appearances tomor-
row sounded like an ideal way to clear
the decks for impending exams, ‘so we
investigated’ the ticket situation.

Three long-distance phone calls over
a two-day period to the Coliseum box of-
fice netted the following assorted bits of
information:

1. The Charlotte Clippers would be
at the Coliseum Wednesday and Thurs-
day, and “The Pajama Game” would be
next door. the same nights. They had
never heard of the Boston Pops.

Undeterred, we tried again.

2. There would be no night per-

formance, only a 4 o’clock matinee, and
tickets would be available at the door.

Having seen an 8:15 performance ad-
vertised for weeks, we decided on one
last gasping try.

3. The night performance was only
for Community Concert ticket-holders. We
don’t belong, so we inquired about
matinee possibilities. ‘Well, yes, we have
tickets, but that’s a children’s _per-
formance.” A_ children’s performance?
“Yes, only people with children will be
admitted.”

We tried to think of how we could
become “people with children” for the
afternoon, but soon gave it up.

We should have been content with a
commonplace old movie anyhow.

Maybe “Giant” will still be on at the
Carolina.

Season of Sadness for the College

In many respects, the Christmas
season just past was a sad one for the
Davidson family. Within one week came
the death of Dr. C. K. Brown, long-time
Dean of the Faculty and Professor of
Economics, and the news of the drowning
of Swain Loy, a member of the class of
1955 and one of the most outstanding
~ men Davidson has produced in recent
years.

Dr. Brown’s passing had a_ very
visible effect on the College. Last Thurs-
day’s memorial service in chapel was a
fitting tribute to this man who had won
the respect and admiration of hundreds
of students who jammed his perennially
packed classrooms since 1923.

Never in our memory had chapel
grown more quickly silent, and this
silence was a tribute in itself. Professors
quietly spoke to their classes of this
gentleman with the surpassingly brilliant
mind, and warm, extremely human per-
sonality to match.

Dr. Brown was a man of strong con-
victions. A staunch and unapologizing
conservative, he refused to compromise
the truth as he saw it. Davidson can ill
afford to lose a man of the stature of
Dr. C. K. Brown. He will be sorely missed.

* ¢ #® ¢ 8
The tragedy of the loss of Swain Loy
with his younger sister in a boating mis-
hap in the eastern part of the state came
as 9 terrible shock to all who knew him.
At Davidson, Swain had a brilliant
record, comparable to many campus

leaders who come and go with the years.
He was president of his fraternity, a
member of Omicron Delta Kappa, and
editor-in-chief of the 1956 Quips and

Cranks, to mention only the high spots —

of an unusually versatile career.

He was generally regarded as one of
the most truly promising young men to
emerge from Davidson in some time.

But a mere recounting of the record
of four short years here falls woefully
short, and is completely inadequate in
telling the story of Swain Loy.

His dedication to the Christian minis-
try, his chosen life-work, was a robust,
manly sort of thing; invigorating and re-
freshing to those with whom he came in
contact.

Alert, keen, enthusiastic, intellectually
able, and full of potential, his untimely
death seems a tragedy in the fullest
sense of the word. And yet, the fullness
and meaning of his life, though cut sud-
denly short, is not dimmed by death.

Brats

Our youth now love luxury. They have
bad manners, contempt for authority, they
show disrespect for elders and love to
chatter in places of exercise. Children
are now tyrants, not the servants of their
households. They no longer rise when
elders enter the room. They contradict
their parents, chatter before company,
gobble up their food and tyrannize their
teachers—Socrates, 400 B.C. —

LAFAR ON THE STATE OF STUDENT GOVERNMENT

President Recalls First Semester
Of Council Accomplishments

By DAN LAFAR

I would like to think that Stu-
dent Government here at Davidson
during the first semester has at-

tempted to put in etrect the wishes
of the group they represent—you,
the Student Body.

Whether or not your representa-
tives have been able to accomplish
their purpose is clearly an individ-
ual determination to be made by
each student. The best way to de-
termine this is to analyze the

Recently involved in a press
furor claiming that basketball was

pulling by controversial “Sunny

over old times with Dr. Tom Scott,
whom he succeeded at Chapel Hill.

Left-over Christmas goodies

this week as the red hordes
ruined fruit cakes and Whit-

Even aristocratic Duke fell

Reports early this morning in-

But it doesn’t make any differ-

Attraction of the week in the

happily sitting on the floor operat-
ing a complicated model electric

Mr. Martin's claim is that

actions and stands your govern-
ment has taken.

FRATERNITY CURFEW

Certainly faculty and student
relations bear witness to a deter-
mined effort on the part of both
students and administrative of-
ficials to reach mutual understand-
ings on all issues whether they
be complex or minute. Exemplary
of this have been the lift of the
fraternity house curfew, the week-
end campus parking freedom, and
the discussions of the Student-
Faculty Conference committee.

Though not in direct relation-
ship to student faculty activities,
the voice of student members on
the religious exercises committee
resulted in a well-rounded Chapel
and Vesper schedule this past se-
mester. This effect will continue to
evidence itself as the year goes on.

UPHOLD REGULATIONS

In its function to uphold the
Constitution of the Student Gov-

ernment, the Student Council has
dismissed two students for Honor
System violations. It has made a
vigorous stand to uphold Student
Body Regulations especially in the
realms of Gentlemanly conduct at
religious exercises and Dormitory
conduct.

COURT OF CONTROL

In the minds of the student
council! members, the Court of
Control of 1956 was a success in
its purpose to be both constructive
and beneficial to Davidson stu-
dents and the college as a whole.

We are assured of a Charlotte
telephone in the College Union
no later than April 1. Though not
the goal of past student leaders,
it is a solution and an answer to
the need.

COLLEGE MAIL SERVICER

One of the things that has not
been fulfilled has been the plan
for a college mail service. It still
remains a pet personal desire to
see Davidson with its own con-
venient and efficient mail service.
We shall continue to work toward
this.

Here are some of the things Stu-
dent Government is doing—only
a small part of what could be done.
We invite your thought and your
criticism. It is our hope that the
tradition of strong student govern-
ment will continue to grow in the
tradition of being an authoritative,
accurate, and unified expression of
student opinion.

Dear Dr. Cunningham:

We are deeply grateful to you,
Dean Sam Spencer, Grier Martin,
and the other members of your
staff for the many kindnesses
which you extended to us during
our recent conference at Davidson.
We know that this put an extra
burden on you during your normal
holiday season, but we feel that
all of the inconvenience and extra
work was more than paid for
through a great conference ex-
perience for over 300 students,
representing 15 denominations and
126 colleges. I sincerely hope that
we have not embarrassed Davidson

College in any way by following
through with our conference plans.

On behalf of the Planning Com-
mittee, Dr. Cunningham, I want to
thank you for being present for
our opening session and for the
cordial words of greeting you ex-
tended to the conference. We felt
completely at home on the David-
son campus. and we were treated
royally in every way.

All the members of the staff of
the Department of Campus Chris-
tian Life join me in sending sin-
cere new year greetings to you
and all the members of your staff.

DR. C. K. BROWN

Scholar and Gentleman

Dr. Cecil Kenneth Brown of Da-
vidson, who died in Charlotte Tues-
day night after a long period of
declining health, was a professor
who never gave up his belief in
the necessity for basic liberal edu-
cation.

His insistence upon the funda-
mentals did not make him imprac-
tical, for his life as a professor
of economics was anything but
cloistered. He enjoyed the confi-
dence of businessmen, and often
they came to him for advice.

It was because of his devotion to
the fundamentals that he was
never led astray by the theorists,
of whom economics has more than
its share. It is, in fact, a happy
hunting ground for theorists for
the very reason that it is not one
of the exact sciences.

Dr. Brown was familiar with
them and their theories. But with
his unfailing logic and an almost
biblical talent for homely illustra-

tion, he could find the loopholes in
the theories and tear them to
shreds.

Dr. Brown was, as a result, much
in demand as a speaker. As such
he was almost as well known
in Charlotte as in Davidson. Until
his health began to fail, he ap-
peared on most of the public and
private forums of this city.

He was devoted to Davidson Col-
lege, for almost the whole of
his professional life had been giv-
en to it. There the man and the
college, both demanding thorough-
ness, found their affinities.

As a churchman he: was equally
dedicated and worked as hard for
the Presbyterian Church as he did
for Davidson College.

The term “scholar and gentile-
man” is rarely heard in these
brash and hurried days, but inso-
far as it survives it can be used
to describe Cecil Kenneth Brown.

Distinguished Son

Quite apart from the pride it
may or may not take in its stay-
at-home natives, Salisbury is re-
minded from time to time of the
great distinctions attained by many
to whom this community has given
birth but has not been able to
maintain as Salisburians.

The reminder of the moment is
an untimely one, and one of be-
reavement in the death of Dr. C.
K. Brown, distinguished scholar

and church leader of the Davidson
College faculty.

Teacher, lecturer; and author of
a wide and enviable reputation,

One of the most significant man-
ifestations of “Collegeitis” pervad-
ing the campus is the glorious cult
of Non-conformity, which, because
of its thorough penetration of the
campus customs of the Davidson
student, has become to be con-
formity to a marked degree. It con-
tradicts itself so flagrantly that it
is reduced to the ridiculous.

The true non-conformist
does not carry on a normal
conversation during the chapel
worship service, but sits quiet-
ly in his seat, demonstrating
by his actions his respect for
the ritual which preceeds the
program.

The true non-conformist makes
no disparaging remarks concern-
ing campus cultural opportunities,
but attends concerts, lectures, and
seminars within the limitations of
his time and interests.

The true non-conformist makes
careful critical judgements con-
cerning life at Davidson. He
recognizes both the gocd and the
bad, instead of condemning every-
thing as being bad.

The true nonconformist
makes on effort to become
friendly with his professors.
He doesn’t shy sway from
them in dread fear of being
labeled 2 “brownnoser.”

These are cases in point; there
are many other examples. It usual-
ly isn't a permanent thing, since
most of us rid ourselves of it
after we have been away-from the
campus for a year or so. However,
we may do well to remember
that some psychologists point to
similar attitudes in teen-agers,
such as duck-tails, Elvis, and
Pegged trousers, as examples of
emothional immaturity. Are we col-
lege boys or college men?

Just prior to the basketball game
Saturday night, a William and
Mary basketball player gazed with
amazement at the fifty or so spec-
tators at the game and said, “Good
Grief! This is ridiculous!”

Fortunately the number in-
cressed as the game pro-
eressed, but we can safely sey

that the stands were never
crowded.

this Salisburian had won his Ph.D.
degree at the age of 25 years, and
had steadily added lustre to his -
name through the years until his
death on New Year’s night at the
age of 56.

The enrichment of mind, soul,
and citizenship he contributed to
his students at Davidson is be-
yond estimate. He was among the
keenest and most lucid socio-eco-
nomic analysts of modern North
Carolina. Personable and engaging
of manner and attitude, he has left
a notable and deep-etched record
of achievement safe from erasure.

Students and faculty alike have
been curious as to the whereabouts
of the Hungarian family the YMCA
gift fund has been donated to sup-
port, and it would seem that even
though the number of suitable
families might not be great, some-
thing should be done in the very
near future.

All over America, Hungarian
familles ere being settled in
communities, and more sre
coming in as time goes by.
We realize that the type end
nature of the family requested
necessitates careful screening,
but surely something could be
done to speed up the process.

If a family cannot be found
soon, there is a very grave and
very real danger that the interest
which reached a high pitch prior
to the holidays will be dissipated
by the passage of time.
