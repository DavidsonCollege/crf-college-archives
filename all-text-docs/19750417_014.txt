Caught in a fiery torrent,
Drowning in his own foolishness,
Seeking salvation from the â€˜
Rock that will

Shatter his skull.

He reaches for that sister of mercy
And meets her too firmly.

Now he resembles the tree broken by lightning,
The butterfly torn by a child yet ignorant of suffering,

The three-pawed fox escaped from the trapper.

he finds sudden peace in this communion
