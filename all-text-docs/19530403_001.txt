scriptures of the Easter Story, the
singing of appropriate hymns, and
prayers.

In case of rain Sunday morning,
the service will be held in Lingle
Chapel of the church. Since the
service will be of some duration,

phere of worship and praise. Dress

His death came only twenty-four
days after he risked his life to re-
cover a fallen comrade’s body and
got this taunting Red warning:

“Get wise .. . Don’t die for big
shot. Get out of this war the best
way you can.”

That Ash Wednesday rescue of a
battle-slain sergeant’s body had
been hailed as one of the most
dramatic incidents of the war. The
Feb. 28 edition of the Washington

Rating Plan

In a meeting on Thursday, March
26, the faculty overwhelmingly
voted in favor of the recommenda-
tion of the committee on frater-
nities to the effect that all fresh-
men would be required to eat in
the cafeteria of the College Union
during the first semester.

Lawrence Erwin, president of
the IFC, along with Dave Robin-
son and Mitchell Patton appeared
before the faculty to restate stu-
dent arguments as well as to an-
swer faculty questions concerning
student feelings and opinions on
the matter. Dr. Cunningham com-
mended the student committee on
the excellent spirit and manner in
which it had undertaken the task
of representing the student body.

The recommendation of the com-
mittee on fraternities was stated
as follows:

“That all members of the Fresh-
man Class shall be required to eat
in the cafeteria of the College
Union during the first semester.
This regulation shall go into ef-
fect in September of 1953.

‘Furthermore, it is understood
that this arrangement is an experi-
mental one to see if such a plan
will bring sbout the desired re-
sults, and that the faculty retains
the right to alter the plan if after

~

{a year or more, it is found that

these results are not being satis-
factorily accomplished.”

The results referred to above
are mainly (1) satisfactory financial
support of the Union, (2) a bolster-
ing of class and college spirit and
unity, and (3) a lessening of the
distinction between fraternity and
non-fraternity men.

the mission.
Reported the Times-Herald:
“Into the bristling valley of Com-

munist rifles the six men wriggled
on their bellies, along the winding
route of a stagnant canal...
“To the rear of that pathetic pro-
cession, their buddies waited for
the hills to fall in on them with
all the thunder that accompanies
a barrage. Three and one-half hours
of deathly silence later, McKeithen
and his men reached the sergeant.”
McKeithen cut the barbed wire
surroupding the body, lifted it

gently on a litter, and the proces-

sion began the slow trek back to
the American lines.

It was later that Lt. McKeithen
found the scrawled Communist
warning on white cloth attached to
the sergeant’s body. The dead
man’s money and valuables were
untouched, but his pockets were
filled with Red propaganda leaf-
lets.

That was February 18. On March
14 Lt. McKeithen died.

He is survived by his parents,

members of Scabbard and Blade,
who thus may be college juniors
or seniors. Each company may sub-

orkman Speaks
To Campus Club

Dr. Workman as guest speaker
at the Campus Club last Thursday

night, gave a discussion type talk

of psychology in general.

He was, as he stated, “out drum-
ming up business.” He recounted
the weak beginning and slow ac-
ceptance of the psychology de-
partment at Davidson. He remark-
ed that it would be desirable to
have a three or four man depart-
ment.

As his main theme, Dr. Work-
man presented some of the needs
and some of the purposes of psy-

ish prose. The play was a dramat-
ie production of the story from
which Shakespeare drew his idea
for “The Taming of the Shrew”.

The characters represented were
played by Mrs. Daggy, Mrs. Geh-
ring, Miss Della Shore, Tommy
Douglass, Bill Hardin, and Jinks
Jervey, with stage direction by
Professor P. N. Trakas. Following
