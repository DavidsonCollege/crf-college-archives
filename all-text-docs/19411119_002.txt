Letters to The Editor

Dear Tony:

With the announcement of the remodeling of
the old Library into a Guest House and “Y” Office,
other ways in which this “College Lounge” can be
used to fulfill campus needs present themselves. -Chief
of these needs which haven't yet been incorporated
into the new building is the problem of the telephone
arrangements in the college dormitories. Some of
the disadvantages of the present system should be
noted first, to show the improvements that a new

plan would make.

These decentralized telephone exchanges that in-
habit the main entrance of each dormitory in the form
of booths have been bothering first floor roomers and
other conscientious students with their ringing de-
mands for years. These years of evidence give all
this time in proof that the present system is unsat-

isfactory and outmoded.

Many times, boys are disturbed needlessly by calls

for boys who live in a distant dormitory, or for a
boy who lives four floors up and ten rooms down the

hall, or by local persons who’ merely “wonder” if a

certain fellow is in his room. Then, at numerous
times, calls aren't answered or the boy isn’t even

Even aside for this lack of responsibility. for tele-
phone calls, there is the frequent urgent ringing of
the telephone bell, which distracts the attention of
half the students in the dormitory, and which par-
ticularly annoys those who room nearby. Answering
the telephone involves time and trouble in trying to
locate the fortunate one, while everyone else wonders
if it was for him.. This altruistic answering, and the
jangling noise to all other persons greatly hinders
studying in a college where it is demanded.

Tomorrow, most of the people of our
great nation will celebrate the three hun-
dred and twentieth Thanksgiving day...
and truly, we have much to be thankful
for.

But yet, let us not be thankful because
other people are cold and hungry and we
are not, because others are sick and naked
and we are not, because others are impri-
soned or enslaved and we are not, because
hellish murder rides through the skies of
Europe and not our own. Yes, let us truly
be thankful, but not in this spirit, for
thankfulness that needs. the savor of an-
other person’s misery can surely not be ac-
ceptable to the Giver of all good and per-
fect gifts. ———

But rather, let us be thankful with the
thankfulness of those few who cannot
feast until they have fed the hungry; can-
not enjoy warmth until they. have warmed
the cold; cannot*enjoy comradeship until
they have visited the bereaved and dis-
heartened; cannot be: content with their
own freedom if they have taken no stand
for the freedom of others.

Let us be thankful that the earth gives

and will give, an abundance to her children,
but let us not be thankful that this abund-
ance is wickedly used so that our cities are
still filled with needless poverty and suf-
fering. Let us be thankful in the hope that
war and tyrannies, the sin and madness of
human maniacs,-have-their-term and will be
ended . ... and that we can have a share
in writing this ending.
- Let us be thankful because we can be-
lieve that those who hunger, those who
sorrow, who suffer, who die while we feast,
are earning for this heartbroken today,
a happier tomorrow.

Let us accept our own slight deprivations
with humble and contrite hearts. Let us
be thankful because we cannot doubt that
in this nation, there resides courage, the
willingness to give if giving will suffice;
to suffer if that is required of us, to face
the powers of hell if only by so doing we
may keep freedom here . . . or anywhere.

Let us be thankful’... yes. But not

complacent.

have it, so it seems to have proved successful else-
where. This telephone exchange will be connected
to small phones on each floor of the dormitories,
preferably near the middle rooms on each hall, where
they will be reached more easily by more students.
The ringing noises of the telephones can be lowered

.greatly in proportion to the radius it serves.

The central exchange can handle all calls and con-

nect the person to the proper hall; then, if the person
is not there, and no information can be gathered as

to his whereabouts, the message can be recorded at
the exchange. When the wanderer returns, he can
learn easily from the exchange where the call-camo

from or the message left.

It can be arranged so that outgoing calls can be
made from each hall telephone if pay-stations are
set up, or from the “Seeial Center” Building, where

privacy can be obtained.

Students can attend to the exchange switchboard
such as those working in the College Library, being
on duty for most of the day and some of the night,
possibly on N. Y. A. time.. For the rest of the
time (a minority), the proposed hostess for the Guest
Building will always be available to attend to the

urgent calls.

For all the reasons herein given, and from the pro-
posed plan, I ask for an investigation im this matter,
as to the expense of installation. A faculty comit-

ED TAYLOR.

This week's letter to the editor expresses a method
in which Davidson's present telephone system may be
improved. The author’s opinion is sound and the need
for such improvement is obvious.

As evidenced by the Extra. Edition Tuesday, the
Davidsonian backs the Gift Fund Project one hundred
per cent.

Will someone please inform sports writers that
Davidson tied Rollins this season instead of Hollins?

There's some difference!
