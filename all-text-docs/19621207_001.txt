NUMBER TWELVE

Pupils Voice Disapproval
Of Compulsory Religion

BY JIMMY DOWNEY

Davidsonian Assistant News Editor

An overwhelming ee
vespers and chapel assemblies

Only 35 students indicated
their endorsement of vespers
and 101 endorsed chapel in the
YMCA poll conducted Oct. 25
concerning the Davidson relig-
ious program.

Opposed to that number were
177 and 226 students who want-
ed to abolish the required ves-
pers and chapels, respectively.
The number of students who
felt that only some kind of im-
provement is needed in vespers
was 226; in chapel, 232.

However a number of stud-
ents not only marked an en-
dorsement of one of the two
services, but also indicated
that the required attendance
at the service be abolished.

These facts were indicated in
the YMCA report to the Faculty
Committee on Religious Life
Tuesday, which will take the re-
sults of the poll under consid-
eration to study the students’

opinions on the religious pro-
gram.

The purpose of the survey
was explained by the YMCA
spokesman, Bill Ferris. ‘This
poll is a student effort to bear
part of our responsibility with
constructive criticism of the
religious life program,” he
wrote.

“This poll is the result of
several students’ concern for
the religious program at Dav-
idson. We submit it realizing
that each of us as a students
is responsible for the relig-
ious program at Davidson. If
the services are not meaning-
ful the fault is, in part, our
own.”

One result of the report that
the committee will consider is
that 69 per cent (224 students)
of those who answered the poll
said that vespers was not mean-
ingful to their life. as students.

y either abolishing or improving the present programs.

But an even greater number—
per cent (319)—indicated that
the Thursday chapel periods
were likewise not useful to
them.

Each answer on the student
survey had to be qualified with
a reason in order to be accepted.

In the YMCA's report to the
faculty committee was includ-
ed a list of students’ sugges-
tions and some random com-
ments on chapel or vespers.

The most frequent comment
by students—143  times—was
that required services cannot be
religious.

One popular idea to im-
prove vespers was to permit
substituting off-campus and
morning services for the regu-
lar Sunday evening vespers
(56 students suggested this);
or attendance at a “cultural
event” instead of vespers (32
votes). Twelve students sug-
gested a greater variety in the
ministers’ denominations, and
a few called for more familiar
hymns in the services.

The improvement ideas for

It is paradoxical that Odetta
had never given a thdught to
folk singing. Her first profes-

field of classics when she was

tion of “Finian’s Rainbow.”

Since this was Odetta’s first
time away from home she _ be-

this trying time she found com-
