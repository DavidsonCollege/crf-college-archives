Wildcats Post Even Record
As Toughest Season Opens

By A. W. TURNER
Davidson's baseball team
has now launched into its
toughest schedule in recent
history, but early season re-

Sults indicate that this year’s °

squad may be one of the
strongest in several years.

Through eight games, the
Wildcats had posted a 44
record despite a number of
injuries due to-early season
cold weather and a number
of games on the road.

The team went on a six-
- game road trip over the
spring break, and returned
with a 3-3 mark.

‘After splitting a couple of
one-run decisions with Bap-
tist College, the ‘Cats won

. two slugfests over Armstrong, ~

22-5 and 13-12. te

Davidson then traveled to
_Wilmington and dropped two
good games to UNC-Wilming-
ton, 1-0..and 5-2.

Since the trip, the team has
split, beating Baldwin-Wal-
lace 9-2 and losing to Pfeif-
fer 1-0.

Coach Tom Stevens was
very optimistic about the
baseball team this year. ‘‘We
have a team that. thinks ‘it
can ‘win,”’-he said, ‘‘We’re
hustling a lot, and we're
Playing aggressive ball.’’

‘Stevens was pleased with
some aspects of the team,
especially praising the hit-
ting, which he called more
consistant than last year. He
~was also happy with the
, pitching performances so far
with, the exception of the two
..games with Armstrong,

' Stevens has a larger and
more balanced club this year
than he has had in the past.
Except for.» his seasoned
_ players such as Bill Barnill,
Harold Wilkerson, Jack Lat-
imer, and Lynn Wagner, Ste-

*vens has platooned frequent-

ly.

“We have enough good tal-
ent this.year to beable to
' put in right handers against
_ left-handed pitchers and vice

versa, to pinch hit more of-
. ten without losing defensive
strength, and to be able to
make defensive changes in

&

‘the late innings,” he skid.

The team is so well stocked
that some very good-looking

prospects such as ‘Larry Gra-

ham, the first black baseball
player in Davidson history,
are finding it hard to find a
place in the line-up. e
Tomorrow the Wildcats be:
gin their Southern Confer-
ence schedule by ‘playing a
double-header with. ViMI.
Besides the usual Southern

Conference foes, Davidson
plays Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill,
Virginia and many other non-
conference opponents ‘ this
year, ;

“It’s the toughest schedule
we've had since I’ve been
here.” Stevens commented,
“but were a more aggressive
team this year, and we've
got a team that thinks it can
do the job.”

Skippers Place Fourth
In First Spring Regatta

By JIM HANNA
Copy Editor

Spring season, as the Wild-
cats finished fourth out of
five teams in a regatta held
at the University of South
Carolina, March 6.

Sophomore Jim Hunter, the
team’s senior skipper, ex-
pressed optimism for the sea-
son,

“This was our first regat-
ta,”’ said Hunters ‘‘and we
just weren't ready. We only
practiced one day, and this
regatta was sort of squeezed
in just before finals.”’ ~

Hunter said that, ‘‘As far
as we're concerned, the real
racing starts Saturday,”
when Davidson hosts six

. teams in a regatta to be held

on Lake Norman.

Tennessee, Duke, North

Carolina, Citadel, South Caro-

lina, and Clemson are sched-
uled to participate along with
Davidson in the re gatta,
Slated to begin At 10:00 am.

“I think we will do: well
Saturday,’’ said Hunter, “I
optimistic as far as

gy Spring goes. This should be

a good season for us.”

Clemson, The Citadel and
South Carolina all placed
ahead of Davidson in the
March regatta, but Hunter
discounted this factor in the
upcoming event.

“In the first regatta those
three schools had the advan-
tage of more practice since
they’ve got
down there. We have a good
chance against them this
time.”’

The season regattas are in
preparation for the confer-
ence championships May 24
at Clemson. All the teams to
be here ‘Saturday are mem-
bers of the South Atlantic
Interscholastic Sailing Asso-
ciation.

Hallam Walker's team will

Sidelines
with
JOE EARLE

Little can be said about the So
Tournament now outside of it turned out to be the
circus everyone predicted. 4

Prior to the tournament, from all corners of the
conference, coaches.and writers were f pherssahe some
team would come out of the pack and beat Davidson.
The only problem was that nobody, particularly those
of us from Davidson, belieyéd them. ,

We went expecting to ’see a good circus and . ex-
pecting to win. e

We got the show. Joe Williams was_there in his
flashy new clothes upstaging. anyone he saw. Lou
Mills was there, grinning for the press after leading

“his Spyders to the finals.

We got the show, but we lost.

How can a team that had only lost one game-in
the conference, and consistently outplayed most of
the same teams it was competing against lose?

“We just got the heck beat out of us,’ was all
Coach Terry Holland could say.

Furman, or rather Jerry Martin, ran the Wild-
cats off the court. Martin and Don Jackson led
an outside attack for the Paladins that dissolved the
Wildcat defense.

But Furman’s outside shooting, disastrous as it-
was ‘for the ’Cats was not the whole story.

_ They just, as coaches are wont to say, out-quick-
ed us.

“They were running over us on the outside and
pushing us around under the basket,” Holland said.
“During the first half we expected the referees to
stop it. When they digat, we did.”

Yet, it seems odd ‘for Furman to be able to push
the Wildcats around. After all, we had what most
coaches called the most physical team in the confer-
ence.

Steve Kirley, Earl Minkin, and Jahn Pecorak
were the same players that knocked around the big-
ger guys in our conference and some of those cele-
brated brutes in the A.C.C.

But, maybe the good guys do win in the end.

‘Davidson managed to rake in the majority of the
post-season honors that can be won.

Terry Holland was elected Coach of the Year for
‘the Conference after the tournament. Holland manag-
ed to beat out Furman’s Joe Williams by a.healthy
margin.

In fact, the hero. of the ice-cream suit. dame in a
poor third behind Warren Mitchell, the coach from
William and Mary, another team eliminated in the.
semi-finals.

The Wildcats had three men to receive confer-
énce honors.

Joe Sutter was the only ’Cat to make first team.
Sutter was lead scorer for the Wildcats, averaging
15.9 points a game.

Steve Kirley was elected to second team all-con-
sReotice and Eric Minkin teceived an honorable men-
ion.

Sutter received a further honor, an honorable
mention for the Associated Press all-American team.

Sutter was the only conference player to be elect-
ed to an all-American team.

Maybe Lou Mills and Joe Williams got to put on

their show, but the Wildcats got the recognition in
_the end.
