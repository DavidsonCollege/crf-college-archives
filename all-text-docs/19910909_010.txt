Charlotte Symphony Faces Troubling Contract Dealings

By Susan Sheffield

Over the past month, The Char-
lotte Observer has reported exten-
sively on the difficulties that the
Charlotte Symphony is having.
Negotiations between management
and musicians have ground to a
halt: originally, the contract play-
ers wanted to negotiate a six per-
cent raise. The board of directors
suggested a thirty percent cut.

“The orchestra’s demands are
wishful thinking,” Leo Driehuys,
Conductor and Music Director,
said, ‘‘and what the management
proposes is an insult to the music
profession.”

September's Gallery

By Will Montgomery

Before I went to the Gallery
Crawl last Friday night I stuffed
my face with spanikopita, bougatza
and retsina wine at the Charlotte
Greek festival. Several of the
Classics abroad seminar °90
members and my bloated self
reminisced about the sights and
tastes of that magical country.
That’s why I missed half of this
season’s first Crawl. Yet I don’t
regret staying so long since I
thought mostof the stuff in Spirit’s
Square was not worth seeing any-
how.

Of the bad art at Spirit Square
I found the overbearing “messages”
being pounded into my visual field
most annoying. I guess all art is
inherently political and message
laden. But throughout the evening
instead of being subtly aestheti-
cally encountered, artists and their
semantics were bleeding on me,
hammering me on the forehead,
tugging on my heartstrings, and
just trying too hard.

in 1977, the symphony has built
itself into an organization ranked
sixth among the thirty-six regional
orchestras in the country. “We were
happy that they didn’t fall off the
stage in 1976,” he said. Granted,
it is not a major orchestra like the
New York Philharmonic or the
Chicago Symphony, but then
Charlotte is not quite the cultural
mecca that large cities are. It also
cannot offer a comparable finan-
cial base.

While the budget has expanded
from $600,000 fourteen years ago
to $3.4 million now, there is cur-
rently an $800,000 deficit. This is
due partly to the 1987 European

I will give Threads, an exhibit
by Ann Rowles, a break, a review
even. To start with, I'll get the
hammer in the forehead out of the
way. Maybe viewing art with a
concussion makes it look cooler
and more startling. Threads was
both cool and startling for that
matter. Her Artistic Statement
reads as follows: My work deals
with the female body. For per-
sonal and political reasons I am
interested in the natural form of
female bodies which is unfortu-
nately considered flawed by stan-
dards of contemporary American
culture. Iamacutely aware of how
deeply those standards are inter-
nalized by women in our
society...Clothing forms are inher-
ently figurative.

Fortunately, her art does not
bog down in her persona or poli-
tics. Unlike the structure of this
article, I read that statement only
after attending each of her nine
pieces, and although I smelled

tour, which occurred just as its
sponsor fell into bankruptcy. This
was only $160,000 of unexpected
expense, however, so the resulting
discrepancy may be attributed to
mismanagement.

Unfortunately, attempts to
remedy this sort of situation are
often counterproductive to musi-
cal quality. According to Driehuys,
a symphony of this size should
have about 77 permanent players,
with extra musicians being hired
for performances. of works by
Beethoven or Mahler, forexample,
which require a larger orchestra.
One management proposal sug-
gests a reduction of contract play-

ers with a concomitant increase in
part-time players. That should at-
tract the cream of the crop. .

“The board of directors 1s
trying to compromise, for finan-
cial reasons of course, but still say,
look what kind of an orchestra we
have. It is ludicrous to try to bal-
ance this budget in one year at the
expense of the musicians,”
Driehyus said.

The conductor takes no part in
the negotiations other than to wait
and see if he can maintain the same
consistent quality to which he is
accustomed. As for the Charlotte’s
aspirations to become a great cos-
mopolitan center, he says:

“If Charlotte is going to pre-
tend to be a world-class city, they
cannot have only basketball, foot-
ball and baseball. They need to
offer ballet, opera, and the sym-
phony as well. To try to do this
without cultural events is too silly
even to mention. Can you imagine
New York without the Philhar-
monic or the Metropolitan Opera?
Would they say, ‘We have the
Empire State Building and the
World Trade Center, they’re nice
enough’? Maybe they can start a
professional bowling team to add
to the city’s prestige,” Driehyus
said.

Armored Vest-Reversible was
another vest. It was covered on the
outside with what appeared to be
tin can bottoms, like atunacan, cut
into triangles of about an inch wide
and two inches long. On the in-
side, long plastic glow worms the
kind used for fishing were sewn
beneath a transparent silken fab-
ric. It had an aggressive, very
porcupined look and might per-
haps still smell like tuna.

I-40 Corridor was an ankle
length dress with a pointedly eco-
logical message. The front was

covered in a lush, deep green col-
lage of fabric while around the side
and down from the neck crept the
invading splotches of black and
grey. The piece captured a sense
of slow paranoia and violation.

I felt the strongest piece was

of claustrophobia with orange fi-
