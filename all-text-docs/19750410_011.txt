Thi’s beat rest in softball,
Bongs top newcomer ranks

Before the volleyball season
gets under way, Brian ‘“‘Bowie”’
Andrews has ordered all op-
ponents of Sid Witz to wear face
masks as the Surgeon General
said recently that his spikes are
hazardous to the recipient’s
health.

It’s not as funny as it sounds
because rumor has_ him
knocking out a poor guy a
couple years ago!, It’s only fair
to build him up in volleyball af-
ter Stiefel did it last week for
softball.

With him and anybody setting
him up, we see the Thi’s as a
strong contender to the
established Staten Island
Fairies.

Speaking of the SIF’s, you
will notice that their illustrious
superstars, C.A. and Y.B., are
no longer writing this often ob-

scene column
Whereas you used to read

C.A. and Y.B.’s column for the
scores and the Freek’s column
for the picks, this serves as a
composite of the two. Even
though it’s mid-season, we still
feel the softball races are wide
open!

Division I

As of the first of this week, the

Thi’s gained undisputed
possession of first place thanks
to the SPE’s 6-5 squeaker over
the Chris Ely-led Chakras. The
SPE’s changed their image by
playing the role of the spoiler in-
stead. of the spoiled.

Right now, the Thi’s average
winning margin is nine runs
while the Chakras and the
SPE’s are deadlocked for
second.

Meanwhile, PIKA is only 4
games back in the all important
loss column.

Division II

Defending champions KA
remained undefeated at 5-0, Phi
Delt B dominated the
dominable Captain Boxwood‘
(who doesn’t? ) 3-0,

After that impressive win, the
Delts fell to Cannon III 14-10.
This latter team tried to sign up
in a B league, but were disap-
pointed that they couldn’t domi-
nate softball the way they had
basketball.

The Kerwood Derbies beat
the Cleveland Browns 13-5 as
walk-on Brian Coffey shows
promise this spring. They later
fell to the Chocolate Speedway
in a defensive battle 18-17. (as
Alan Duncan’s still tender foot
couldn’t come through with a
clutch field goal)

Other noteworthies in this

800 schools and the Army
are making college a reality
for more young people.

About eighteen months ago, the Army
began to develop a bold, new concept in cooperative

education. Project Ahead.

The program began at one university in
the Midwest. Interest was so great the Army
decided to expand it across the country. Today,
the program involves more than 800 colleges
and universities. And it’s still growing.

Project Ahead’s structure is basically
simple. But its benefits to young people
and their parents are enormous. :

First of all, it is a unique individualized
education plan. One that allows you to choose, if
you qualify, an “alma mater” before you enlist.
(Normally a participating school in your home area.)
So no matter which college or colleges you attend
while in the Army, you'll know beforehand the
courses you'll need for credit at the school you want

to graduate from. °

Secondly, the Army provides financial aid.
College courses are available'to you while you’re
in the Army. And the Army will pay up to 75% of
the tuition for these courses. (After your enlist-
ment’s over, you'll be eligible for 36 months of
financial assistance under the G.I. Bill.)

For more information, call your Army .

pointment.

Division III

Top to bottom this looks like
the strongest division. How
could you avoid good records
when two teams forfeited out of
the division?

Without a doubt, Richardson
Ill or the Bongs, are ‘high’
with a 6-0 slate as they
“‘bowled’”’ over KA#2 4-3. This
team looks like the ‘‘cream of
the crop” for all freshmen to ad-
mire.

Baseball-reject Dan Heder-
son led the 5-0 Delt A team past
Richardson II (SPE’s of the
future) , 3-0.

The 5-0 Beavers led by Butch
Beard’s two shutouts show
definite likenesses to the
Oakland A’s. (most notably the
green and gold uniforms) As
soon as Tenafly can grow a
mustache, they will win it all.

Also -hanging tough is Pen-
thouse at 4-1.

Summing up, we see the final
four as IFT, KA#1, PDT A, and
Jerry Mathers as the Beavers!

Volleyball leaders

Here are the division leaders
as volleyball gets under way: I-
PDT #2, II- Emanon A and Der-
bies A, III- Emanon Z and SIF
(SPE’s are leading here too, but
we decided not to mention
them), IV- IFT, V- FIJI (what a
weak division).

wins with Weicker bat

By BOB HAYMAN
Staff Writer

Outstanding hitting, led by
George Weicker, whose
average continues to hover near
the .500 mark, effective pitching
by the entire staff, and a
steadily improving defense
highlighted a 3-2 week that
boosted the Davidson’ baseball
team’s overall record to 13-8.

Thursday saw the Widcats
hosting Brockport (N. Y.
State). Pitcher Tim Barr held
the Brockport batters to four
scattered hits while the David-

son nine pounded out ‘11 hits in

an impressive 9-1 victory.

Dale Horner went 2 for 5 and
scored twice and Mitch Stone
scored twice ina 1 for 4 day, but
the big guns for Davidson were
rightfielder Ed Willingham and
first baseman Weicker.

Willingham went 3 for 4 with
two RBI’s and a run scored
while Weicker doubled and
singled in three at bats. The big
first baseman also scored twice
and knocked in three runs.

Friday’s effort was less suc-
cessful as Davidson dropped a
tough 6-5 decision to Wake
Forest.

Davidson outhit the visitors
11-8 but surrendered two runs
on costly errors.

Shortstop Gary Pomeroy,
designated hitter Bill Todd, and
second baseman Dave Year-
wood each had two hits while
Weicker contributed three to
the losing cause.

On Sunday, Davidson
traveled to Boone for an im-
portant game with Southern
Conference foe Appalachian
State. The ride»home was a
happy one as the Wildcats won
9-5 and boosted their conference
record to 5 and 1, good enough
for first place.

Horner picked up two hits,
two walks, and three runs while
left fielder Billy Lynn collected
two hits,
loaded triple in the eighth in-
ning. Weicker went 3 for 4 while
senior, in two more runs.

Joel Tew picked up the victory
for Davidson, his fourth in six
decisions.

The week’s final action took
place on Tuesday, April 8, when
Davidson hosted William and

’ Mary in a Southern Conference

doubleheader. Davidson won
the first game, a 3-2 thriller, but
‘dropped the second, in a disap-
pointing 2-0 loss.

The first game wasn’t
decided until the bottom half of
the seventh and final inning.
Third baseman Horner led off
the inning with a single, was
sacrificed_to second by Stone,
went to third on Pomeroy’s
groundout, and then scored ona
two out single by Weicker.

Barr lifted his record to 4-1 by
allowing just four hits, and was
given fine support by a defense
that committed no errors and
pulled off two double-plays.

The second game_ was
disastrous for Davidson batting
averages as William and Mary
pitcher Mark Kelliher allowed
just one hit. Stone broke up
Kelliher’s bid for a no-hitter
with a lead off double in the
seventh.

The Wildcats loaded the bases
in that inning but couldn’t score
and Dwight Plemmons fine
five-hit pitching was wasted ina
losing cause. Weicker, in-
cidentally walked twice and
was hit by a pitch.

The split pleased neither the
players nor first-year coach
Junior Wade, but stll main-
tained Davidson’s lead in the
conference. Their conference
record now is an impressive 6
and 2.

Much of the team’s success is
certainly attributable to Coach
Wade, who is on his way to

i the first winning
baseball team at Davidson in
the past two decades.

Catcher Mark ‘Rodgman of-
fered a simple explanation for:
the surprising achievements:
‘““We’re studs.”’

Davidson will defend its hold
on first place this week’ with a
conference game at the Citadel
on April 9, a home game against
Pfeiffer on Friday at 3 p.m., a
game with Guilford at 2 p.m. ‘on
Saturday and a big
doubleheader at Richmond on
Monday, April 14.
