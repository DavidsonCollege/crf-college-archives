LOST AT SEA: The annual regatta at Lake Norman was the last event
in Freshman Orientation Week.

Orientation Week scores success

By TONY SNOW

There are some things that
are unavoidable in the
freshman’s life. The first of
these is orientation.

Freshman orientation began
for 370 new students Septem-
ber 6.

We all have memories of the
day we came to school to live.
Emotional or unemotional
goodbyes...fear...joy at being
on our own..or whatever.
Probably the strongest most
pervasive feeling was one of
confusion.

Confusion and chaos, in fact,

ruled the first few days of life at
Davidson for.the new students.

Some began orientation by
trying to find their roomates,

others dragged foot lockers,
stereos, or posters. At one

point no less than 15 cars were

parked illegally in front of
Richardson dorm, including one

\10 ton van bearing Garden

State license plates.

The van caused a great upset
at Davidson’s precinct two as
the police tried to haul the
awesome vehicle away with a
wrecker only half its size. The
van’s owner showed up in time
to avert the crisis.

Disorganization again took
over at the president's recep-
tion Saturday night. The recep-
tion was moved from the pres-
ident’s house to Cunningham
Fine Arts Center and back
again three times, oweing to
intermittant rain.

Activities for the freshman

continued throughout the or-
ientation week, succeeding in
being interesting enough to
keep student’s minds away
from home and informativie
enough to be important. Many
upperclassmen saw fit to return
in time to enjoy some of the
fun.

A talent show was held in
Love auditorium. This year’s
talent was assisted by Marc
Menchel in the role of ‘Johnny’
(Carson) and assistant director
of the union Russ Kushigan as
‘Ed’. The talent ranged from
skits involving entire floors in a
reinactment of a hall meeting,
about sex to some really fine
music played on classical
guitar.

The people hunt was one
event designed to be fun and

informative. Students ran
among themselves trying to
match people with information
about them gleaned from ap-
plications. Success ranged from
fourth Richardson’s winning
tally of 22 correct answers to a
dismal seven.

The cake race proved to be
an interesting activity, pitting
all the freshmen against each
other and a clock on a one mile
cross-country type run. Cakes
were given to the top 46 men
and top 10 women.

Doug Horn, who won the
race, established a new record
for the 1.7 mile course. Horn
ran the distance in 8:33.8
minutes beating Pete
Ashcraft’s record of 8:45.5 set
in 1952. The second place
finisher this year also went
under the time of the old
record, running an 8:34.

For the girls, first-place
finisher Paula Kadison dest-
royed the old female record.
Her time of 11:43.4 was a full

minute and 54 seconds better
than the previous best by

Margaret Hunter.

The week of orientation
ended with the day at the lake
campus. The annual freshman
hall regatta was the highlight of
the day which incl:ded an egg
toss, swimming, and relay
races.

The regatta was the sole
property of first Richardson.
Their entry beat all of the
others by fifty yards. One
winner makes many losers and
there were halls who felt as if
they were racing in the
Burmuda Triangle.

The egg toss, a competition
between hall counselors was
captured by the duo of Gary
Barnes and Lee Grogan.

The orientation week turned
out to be a_ success. New
students became acquainted
with their school and with each
other. They had fun and earned
a sense of belonging in
Davidson.
