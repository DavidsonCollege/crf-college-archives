sons are invited,

Summer C.

The summer camp fof advanced
ROTC students which is held at
Fort Benning each year promises
to be one of the largest ever this
year. The infantry is sending one-
third of its advanced ROTC stu-
dents to Fort Benning’ this year.
This is a new plan by the army.
An expected 5,000 men are due
to participate in the exercises held
this year. The program in Georgia
will begin June 20 and las until
August 1. Forty-seven Davidson
men are planning to take the trip.

The Oratorio Singers of Char-

F. Berg, will perform Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart's “Requiem” at
the Myers Park Methodist Church
in Charlotte on Sunday afternoon,
May 11, at 3:00 p.m.

In addition to the oratorio, the
group will also sing two shorter
contemporary works by Gustav
Holst—the short festival, “Te
Deum,” for chorus and orchestra,
and “Psalm 148” for chorus, string
orchestra and organ. The public is
invited to attend; there is no admis-

word: Freshmen. Dole has been looking around the Caro-
linas and vicinity for new talent ever since he signed a
Davidson contract. and thinks he has eight or ten really
good ballplayers lined up. Quality rather than numbers is
what Dole *s looking for, and it is a pretty sure bet that
his frosh recruits will be capable of helping the Red and
Black win ball games.

It merely remains now to see what the new Wildcat coach
can come up with in the way of a team. If the next couple seasons
see his team steamrollered over in the manner of previous years,
he may eventually go the way of previous Cat coaches. He won't
make any predictions as to his team’s chances next fall. but as
far as we know he hasn't signed up for any business classes yet.
All we can do now is to give him our support, cross our fingers

and hope that he turns out to be the medicine man that Davidson:

The forum on Courtship and Mar-

ler Nash has been one of the most
successful of the Y forums this
year.

Many students, after hearing
Mrs. Nash in chapel this morning
and in the discussion in the YMCA
lounge, remarked that they were
greatly aided by her frank and un-
derstanding discussion of courtship
and marriage problems.

Mrs. Nash, wife of a University
of North Carolina Bible professor,
Arnold Nash, is chairman of The
Parenthood Division and Family
Council, Incorporated, of Chapel
Hill. She is the author of several
pamphlets on marriage problems..

Being very popular with the stu-

The third and final point is the

that the three governing factors

The golf competition will be fol-

Davidson's attitude toward cen-

what is a major flaw in the Ameri-

of the administration who have

it is. And also I have written in
