Shingle belles, shingle belles,
Shingle all your hair ;
Don't forget to wash your neck,
Or else don't leave it bare.
Shingle be'les, shingle belles,
Right up to the dome,
Ain't it fun, the more you cut
The less you have to comb.

Camel

'

CAREFUL observation will reveal
that men of quality demand quality
in a cigarette—smoke Camels. A
Carne! smoker goes straight to the
point in cigarettes and demands
enjoyment.

For there are no better tobaccos
or blending than you get in Camels.
There is no other cigarette taste
and fragrance that can compare
with Camels, because they are

rolled of the choicest Turkish and

attracts the quality smoker

Domestic tobaccos grown. In a ciga-
rette, as in the smoker, there is noth-

ing that can substitute for quality.

If you want to know what ex-
perienced smokers like, just try
Camels. Each year new millions try
them all and find in Camels enjoy-
ment realized. Camels never tire
the taste. To test the quality of
Camels, compare them with any
cigarette made regardless of price.
