BLYTHE WRITES ABOUT

(Concluded from page 1)
thousand dollars for the Aiumni Ath-
letic fund. ‘The executive committee of
the Davidson Alumni Athletic Associa-
tion has been devoting its energy, time
and its money in securing coaches for
Davidson and her Alumni and in trying
to arouse the interest of old Davidson
men. [Eyerybody connected in any way
with the college is delighted with the suc-
cess of the two coaches who were secured
by the Alumni Association and who have
revolutionized foot ball at the college,
and have aroused a high degree of clean,
wholesume, college spirit and loyalty
among the students so that the college
will be benefited for years to come.

‘“lhe committee is now trying to close
a contract with an excellent base ball
coach, a loyal Davidsonian, to assist Mr.
Fetzer in giving us a winning base ‘ball
team for the coming season. Through
ack of the necessary funds the hands of
the committee are tied, nor have they
any assurance that the Alumni will hack
them. Where is that boasted Davidson
loyalty? Where are those men who se
enthusiastically originated this meve-
ment? Where are the funds to dis-
charge the obligations assumed by the
Alumni through their committee? “Fhese
questions are serious ones to the com-
mittee. Kither there will be a heavy
burden laid upon the committee or a
privilege and a light duty for each in-
dividual alumnus who has any claim of
loyalty to the college that did so much
for him. Which shall it be? T assure
you that this moncy will go to pay the
salaries and expenses of the coaches, and.
tot to pay men to play on the teams.
statement of expenditures will be pub-
lished in Tre Davinsontan.

“We beg that every Davidson alum-
nus respond to this call’ by sending his
subscription or cash to Mr. C. B. Bailey,
who is Secretary and ‘Treasurer of the
committee, at Davidson, or hand them to
Mr. KO. Pharr when he comes to sce
you. Mr. Pharr is employed by the
Alumni Association committee to collect
funds from the Alumni. Let us all prove
our college spirit and loyalty by helping
with this fund. F. L. Bryrite,

Pres. A. A. Assn.”

phone. in the hope that they could be
induced to come, they said that it was
absolutely impossible for them to come,
and that they must cancel.
