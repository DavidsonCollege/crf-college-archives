M.L.K. and a ‘Dream Deferred’

By Cunt SMITH
Staff Writer

“People need to hear the truth,
not the pretty truth, but the ugly
truth that makes people get up and
do something.”

This quote by Huey Freeman
from the television cartoon “The
Boondocks” embodies the forth-
right nature of the riveting sympo-
sium, “The Return of the King: A
Montage of a Dream Deferred.”

Conducted by Darrel Scott-’10
and Solvig Pittenger °06, the
Monday afternoon event addressed
the portrayal of African-Americans
in our country after attendees
watched an episode “The
Boondocks.”

The cartoon, an animated televi-
sion series on the Cartoon
Network’s “Adult Swim,” satirizes
the racial tensions and cultural
Stereotypes that exist within the
social fabric of American society
today.

The episode aired during the
seminar, titled “Return of the
King,” focused on a hypothetical
scenario in which Martin Luther
King, Jr. wakes from a coma only

to find American, and particularly
African-American, culture com-
pletely different than he left it 32
years earlier. King experiences a
resurgence in popularity and subse-
quently signs a book deal, receives
massive media coverage and is
even appears on television talk
shows.

On one such show, King is asked
how he believes America should
react to the 9/11 terrorism attacks.
King responds that America should
turn the other cheek. In the
episode, the public is shocked that
King would act so passively in the
wake of such an attack. The nega-
tive reaction he gets ultimately
leads “Time Magazine” to put him
on the front cover with the headline
“Traitor?”

At this point Scott paused the
film and asked the crowd for opin-
ions thus far.

Many students agreed that while
comedy is an effective means of
dealing with important issues, it is
unfortunate that such important
issues should have to be coated
with humor to be discussed.

Next fall, the Class of 2012 will
be able to participate in a new pro-
gram called Cats Connect. Cats
Connect is a mentorship program
linking newly arrived freshmen to
upperclassmen in an effort to
strengthen the community of
Davidson.

Freshmen that sign up for the
program will be matched with a
same-sex mentor, and each mentor-
mentee pair will be organized into
four-person “families.” These fam-
ilies will be required to participate
in a service project for a minimum
of one weekend per semester.
However, they may choose to meet

more frequently.

The program was the brainchild
of three students: Neely Meeks
709, Heath Pelham 710, and Abi
Johnson ’10 during a leadership
retreat last year. At the retreat,
groups of students participated in
an activity where they were invited
to design a program in response to
an editorial written in response to
the Virginia Tech tragedy.

Meeks, Pelham and Johnson
came up with Cats Connect and
were so excited about it that they
decided to work on the project
beyond the retreat. The students
consulted Dean of students Tom
Shandley and worked together on
the project over the summer.

“We had a great vibe about it—

said. Cats Connect is now a char-

tive board, advisory board and
plans to implement the program
next year.

Each incoming freshman will be
mailed a letter about the program
in the fall and given the option to
sign up for it. It will also be publi-
cized —_—_ during Freshman
Orientation. There is no limit to
the number of freshman that may
participate.

After committing to the pro-

‘Four’ highlights risk

By ALISSA CURRAN
News Editor

On Tuesday, Jan. 15, many fra-
ternity and eating house members
attended a sex-specific presenta-
tion on. sexual assault in Duke
Auditorium.

The presentation was given by
the non-profit organization “One in
Four,” a name that represents one
in four college women survive rape
or attempted rape. The organiza-
tion was founded by a group of col-
lege friends upon their graduation,
and “One in Four’ now travels to
many colleges and universities
annually to raise awareness about
sexual assault.

On a sleepy college campus such
as Davidson’s, where most stu-
dents can recognize a stranger
immediately because it is not a
familiar face from around campus,
this presentation seemed absurd.
Most popular notions of rape

include strangers confronting
women walking alone in dark
alleys.

However, Davidson’s intimate
and trusting environment does not
exempt it from incidents of sexual
assault. The “One in Four” presen-
tation stated that nearly four out of
five times a woman is raped it is by

if.

someone she knows, a scary reality
on a campus where the comforta-
bility of ieveryone knowing every-
onei does not provide protection
from this scary statistic.

“There is no perfect solution to
tape: when people choose to do it,
it often happens,” one of the “One
in Four” presenters said.
“However, you can help yourself
and your friends by learning to
identify high-risk situations and
how to help someone if you know
he or she is a victim of sexual
assault.”

As an introduction, the presenta-.

tion provided the audience with a
basic definition of rape and
explained that the definition varies
from campus to campus and state
to state. Mental capacity plays an
important role in determining rape,
because it specifies whether some-
one can understand the conse-
quences of the sexual action at the
time it occurs.

The second part of the presenta-
tion included a video in which a
doctor was shown interviewing a
male who had committed an act of
sexual assault on a woman -- who
never reported the incident.

The incident occurred at a frater-
nity .party, before which brothers

girl- conceptualized as easy- and
making a “special punch” for them
with copious amounts of alcohol .
After this particular individual
coerced a younger girl into drink-
ing too much punch, he ignores her
attempts to stop him and rapes her.

The presenters highlighted the
attitude and rhetoric of this particu-
lar rapist as common amongst sex-
ual predators.

“In using words like ‘targets,’
‘prey,’ and ‘stake out,’ he is dehu-
manizing his victims,” one of the
presenters noted.

Another influence that encour-
aged this individual was the group
mentality of his fraternity. Due to
the fact that all the other brothers
were engaging in the same acts in
the same manner, he felt what he
did was justifiable.

The last segment of the presenta-
tion helped the audience learn how
to help a friend who is a victim of
sexual assault.

“Only five percent of all rapes
are reported,” one presenter noted.
“The best thing you can do for a
friend who is a victim of sexual
assault is to talk less and listen
more. It’s natural to be curious and
to want to ask questions, but it will
help your friend a lot more if you
just listen.”
