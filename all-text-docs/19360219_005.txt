THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 19, 1936

Two Davidson Boys
Arrest Themselves

Handcuffs, Accidentally Lock-}
ed, Must Be Taken to Court
To Be Unloosed.

NEGRO’S TRIAL HALTED

Drunken Witness Testifies,
But Accused Is Absent

On last Monday night, the
local court, just ready to be-
gin the hearing of a trespass-
ing case, was rudely interrupt-
ed by the entrance’ of two Dav-

idson College students hand-
cuffed together.
These students (whom we. shall

call Jim White and Richard Jones)
had

slipped

loops and had accidentally locked
the handcuffs
The boys looked around for a

key, but not being able to find one,
decided to go to the court and get
a policeman to free them, Arriving
at the court just as Tt was ready
to open, they pushed up to the front

through a crowd of negroes, and
got to the policeman to free them.
After these boys had left,, the

trial of a negro (we shall call him
Amos Lowe for convenience), who
was charged with trespassing on
the property Mary Aiken (to
use a fictitious name) was begun.
But since Lowe, the accused, did
not feel in the mood to attend court
and hence did not appear, the trial
was not very successful.

The judge found that Lowe had,
without permission, entered Mary’s
house in order to escape some local

ot

“Dillingers” who were planning to
mob and possibly kidnap him,
After asking many questions
which received only insensible an-
swers, the judge told one of the
witnesses to retake the stand.

“Is you going to swear me in
again, suh?” asked the witness.
“What, Swear you in again?” said
the judge. “I have sworn you in

twice already! All right, put your
hand on the Bible. Do you hope to
tell the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth?” “Yas, sth,”
replied the. witness,

“Why were you going to this
girl's house?” the judge asked.,
“Suh, why was I going? I don’t
know, suh, I was just going to be
coming,” replied the

frightened
negro,

“Was Amos drunk when you went
to the house?

" “Yas, suh,” was the
answer; “he was ‘sorta sailing kinda
high.” I was helping him along on
my arm.”
“Were you drunk?”
“Who, me? Nor, suh, I
drunk,” replied the negro.

“What! Do you mean to say that
you can stand up here in the court

of the-law-and Say you weren't
drunk on a Sunday night?” de-
manded the judge, “Yas, suh. I sho

“AIL right, get down,” ordered the

justice.

The sermon, directed especially to
the young people of the congrega-

Glass discussed two religions: a
Passive, or non-working religion,
and an active religion which may
really be put into practice.

The relative cost of living a
Christian life as compared to the
rewards which it will bring were

emphasized,

The quartet, composed of Paul

Hudson, J. D. Allen, C. M. Ram-

that expressed in a letter from Dean
Herman Schneider of the Univer-
sity of Cincinnati College of »En-
gineering and Commerce. He writes
in part:

“We have a number of young

pacity for college work who would
have been denied seeing the inside

is the large number of youngsters
who have been unable to get posi-

Among the jobs being done by
college and ggaduate students are
working: upon the golf course, as-
sistingy in the laboratories, working
