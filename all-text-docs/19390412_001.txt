Flake “Red” Laird, Davidson
Coach For Ten Years, Leaves

For Position With V. P. IL.

Laird Pondered for Several
Weeks Before Acceptance
Saturday

WILL BE FROSH COACH

To Be Among Friends, Young-
er and Tilson

' Flake (Red) Laird, one of
Davidson’s best-liked coaches,
sent in his resignation last
Saturday in accepting an offer
from Virginia Polytechnic In-
stitute’ that will make him
head coach of that institutton’s
freshman teams.

Coach Laird, during his ten years
of coaching at Davidson, has been
head baseball coach and freshman
coach in basketball and football.
He had pondered his decision of
V. P. L's offer for several weeks
before he resigned.

Great Athlete

An alumnus graduating in 1927
from Davidson, Laird was one of
the best all-around athletes the col-

lege has produced. He attended
Davidson when freshmen were al-
lowed to participate in varsity

competition and he piled the amaz-
ing total of 12 letters—four from
each of basketball, football, and
baseball. In addition he captained
the basketball team.

After finishing school here the
affable mentor coached two years
at Catawba College before taking
up his present duties.

Among Friends

The selection of Laird by the
Virginia technical school was un-
doubtedly influenced by the fact
that he won while here at David-
son the esteem of all who worked
with him. At°V. P. I. he has several
old pals who knew him at David-
son, among whom Wias
(Monk) Younger, director of ath-
letics, and Tex Tilson.

Campaign

Former Davidsonian Leads
Membership Drive

Howard Arbuckle, of Pro-
fessor Emeritus Howard Bell Ar-
buckle and member of the class of
28, been acting general
chairman of the annual Y. M. C.
A. membership round-up during the
week of May 1-5.

This campaign drive for mem-
headed by Mr. Arbuckle,
is the largest ever to be held in
Charlotte. 213 men, sponsored by
the publicity committee of the Jun-
ior Chamber of Commerce, will
take part in the drive. No mem-
bership campaign was held last
year because of the renovation
campaign which completely mod-
ernized the facilities of the Y. M.
C. A. building.

Good Co-operation

Mr. Arbuckle made the follow-
ing statement in regard to the
campaign: “The people of Char&
lotte made it possible by their gen-
erous co-operation in the building
program to give Charlotte a com-
pletely modernized Y. M. C. A.
building. I feel honored by the
privilege of being chairman of the
drive to be» held May 1-5 which
will extend to the people of the
community a chance to utilize to
a full extent the modern facilities
there afforded. In perfecting the
organization for the campaign, I
encountered on all sides such en-
thusiastic co-operation that the
success of the drive seems assured.”

Mr. Howard Arbuckle announced
that E. ‘R. Bucher and James J.
Harris will serve in the capacity of
co-chairmen of the campaign. Each
will have under him five generals
who will have under him five cap-
tains and each captain, three work-
ers, making a total of 213 workers
in all.

This campaign is expected to fill
a real need, as it will give the
