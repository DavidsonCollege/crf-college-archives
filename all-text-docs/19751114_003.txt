Women criticize Cartmill
claim slow athletic buildup

By JAMIE KOLODITCH
Staff Writer

Davidson College Director
of Athletics Thomas A. Cart-
mill denies charges that the
athletic department has been
dragging its feet in building
the women’s athletic program.

The major controversy con-
cerns the women’s basketball
program. Members of the
women’s basketball squad
have complained that the ath-
letic department made little
effort to find a suitable coach
for the coed squad.

“We asked Mr. Cartmill to
find us a coach immediately
after the state tournament last
year, and were assured that
they would do their best.”

Rosa Lee Janaro was ap-
pointed last week as tempor-
ary head coach of the girls’
basketball team. She has
played college basketball, but
she has had no coaching
experience,

The players question the
wisdom of this temporary
appointment.

“This (the temporary ap-
pointment) means that the
team will have played under
four different coaches in four
years. It seems wrong to have
to adjust to a coach now, only
to have to adjust to a new
coach next year, especially
since we now have a winning
team.”

Cartmill explained that it
was a matter of expediency.
‘‘Tt was necessary to find a
temporary coach in order to
satisfy the requirements of the
women’s athletic association.
We could not hire a permanent
coach because the administra-
tion had not programmed one
for the purpose.

“We did our best to find a
suitable coach. We had located
a highly qualified temporary
coach during the summer, but

she was then offered a perma-
nent position at another insti-
tution.”

Cartmill realized the girls’
concern at having a different

year, but pointed out that
hiring is a perogative of the
administration.

“‘No one wants a fulltime
coach as much as I do. We
have done everything possible
in this regard.”

As to practicing time for the
team, Cartmill said that the
women’s team had second
priority in gym time.

In regard to the women’s
athletic program as a whole,
Mr. Cartmill feels that every-
thing possible is being done to
build a sound program, __

‘A lot of times people don’t
realize that we want these
things as much as the stu-
dents. The budget for wo-
men’s basketball has been

quadrupled from that of last
year, and the tennis budget
has been doubled.

‘“‘In addition, we .1ave ac-
quired thegequipment for the
establishment of a field hockey
team, which is now at the club
level.”

The appropriations for the
building of the women’s pro-
gram hinges on student inter-
est in such matters. An appro-
priation cannot be made until
such appropriation has been
requested by the department
involved.

Patricia Drake, head of

women’s athletics, expressed
satisfaction with the respons-
iveness of the athletic depart-
ment to the needs.and desires
of the coeds.

_.. Annual Fund

(Continued from page 1)

“It is difficult to do a fund
each year in this fashion
without sounding repetitious.
In raising money for some-
thing new like the Little
Library you can focus atten-
tion and excitement on the
facility. But before we have
even raised the Annual Fund
money, the college has already
budgeted and spent the mo-
ney.

“T interviewed a great num-
ber of people for this position
since last May,’’ continued
Williams, ‘‘and Tom was one
of the youngest ones. I found
that he has an unusual dedi-
caton and commitment to the
college.

»“‘He can write clearly and
concisely and is a very orderly
type person. He designed and
implemented a central \pur-
chasing system for the city of
Lenoir. He knows hows to deal
with people and can speak
well.”’

Speaking on the jump in.

this year’s Annual Fund goal,
Bernhardt said, ‘‘I think it’s a
very realistic goal and.I don’t

and hopefully exceeding it.
It’s just a matter of long
hours and saying the right
things to the right people.

‘I think it’s important that
Zack Long and I make all of
the alumni feel that they are a
part of this campus. so much
of Davidson’s reputation is
based on what alumni have
done.

“This year I want to put
special emphasis on the recent
grads, say within the last ten
years. I also want to work
with seniors so that instead of
thinking of us as just wanting
money from them when they
leave, they can still feel that
they are a part of the school.

“T know that I scoffed at the
Update when I was a student,
but as an alumni it is some-

thing you look forward to qs:

reading--cover to cover. In it
are the names you recognize,
the places you remember. It’s
a very important part of
alumni relatons.”’

Exam procedure

The college calender calls for exams to be taken
Nov. 21, 22, 24, 25. Not all professors use the self-
scheduled procedures described here, so each student
should determine definitely the exam arrangements for
each course. If self-scheduled procedures are used then
the following instructions apply.

The examination envelopes turned in earlier in the week
will be available to vou during each examination session
onNov. 21, 22, 24, 25You do not need to specify in ad-
vance when you will write a particular exam.

Go to Chambers Banquet Hall between 8:40 and 9:15 for
morning sessions and 1:40 and 2:15 for afternoon sessions
and ask for the envelope containing the exam you want to
take at that time. The envelopes will be arranged
alphabetically by the student’s name. The yellow bor-
dered card will be detached and retained by the
examination staff.

Go to any class room in Chambers Building and write
the exam; please note that room 310 in Chambers is to be
used exclusively by students authorized by the professor
to use tables, charts, etc.

The envelope, with red bordered card still attached and
containing the questions and your answers, may be retur-
ned to the examination center as early as 9:45 for the mor-
ning and 2:45 for the afternoon and must be returned
before the deadline of 12:15 for the morning: and 5:15 for
the afternoon. The honor plege must be signed at the
examination center table as you turn in the exam envelope.

The yellow bordered card, now receipted by the
examination center, will be given you; hold that card until
a grade for the course is received; in case of any
irregularity it is your evidence that you turned in the
exam envelope containing exam materials.

The college will continue to use the Student Instruction

Report as an instrument of course evaluation. You wilk’

receive one from each of your professors. Please com-
plete it and remember that you must turn it in when you
get your exam envelope at the Examination Center in
Chambers Banquet Hall (or at the Registrar’s Office if
you have a professor-administered exam).

in the past a good many evaluations have been invalid
because of inadequate course identification.. To aid there
you are requested to see to it that full identification of
department, course number, and section are entered on
the upper right corner of each sheet. Professor’s name
and student’s name are not needed.

Registrar Richard C. Burts said,‘‘Our continuing con-
cern for the Honor System and the attendant strains on it
occasioned by self-scheduled exams __ justify
our...soliciting continuing student support for the Honor
System.”’
