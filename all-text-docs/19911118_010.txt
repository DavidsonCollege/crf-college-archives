Coach Bob McKillop Promotes Experienced Squad

By Chris Hood

Optimism runs rampant among
Davidson basketball faithful as the
1991-92 season approaches. With
fourreturning starters, experienced
reserves and a talented freshman
class, the Wildcats appear prepared
to tackle a challenging schedule.

Davidson is regardedas one of
the top teams in the Big South
Conference, and a post-season
tournament bid is a definite possi-
bility.

In this interview with the
Davidsonian, third-year coach Bob
McKillop shares his expectations
for the season, Davidson’s oppo-
nents, the Big South’s automatic
bid in the NCAA Tournameni and
the future of Wildcat basketball.

Davidsonian: Many of the prog-
nosticators who expected Davidson
to finish near the. bottom of the
conference last year are predicting
the ‘Cats to be near the top of the

your explanation for this quick turn-
around?

McKillop: Undoubtedly the expe-
rience factor, because the fresh-
men that played sucha vital part of
our team last year are
now a year older.

hope to learn from

McKillop: The sea-

an obligation, a respon-

sibility and a desire to paddle to-

we’re more concerned witha sense
of the team as a whole than this
concept of the ‘sophomore jinx’.

Davidsonian:Y ou have broughtin
another good recruiting class this
season. How will this year’s fresh-
men fit into your mold?

McKillop: Franco [Ferroni],
George [Spain] and Frank [Harris]
came in here knowing they could
make contributions as freshmen.
George has been particularly
impressive in pre-season scrim-
mages. He has shown us a tough-
ness and an aggressive nature we
didn’ tsee very frequently last year.
The athletic skills he has are what
we recruited him for; his tough-

one more number to our list of
three-point shooters plus a good
size at 6-8 to play inside. The three
of them give us a great deal of ver-
satility and ingredients that we defi-

. hitely need.

Davidsonian: How will you ac-
count for the loss of forward James
Marsh?

McKillop: Marsh was perhaps our
quickest and best front-court de-
fender. He was tough, aggressive
and experienced.

If he came back, he would still
be challenged for playing time this
year by Franco, by the maturity of
Paul Drobnitch, by the maturity of
J.D. Heuer, by the recovery to
health of Scott Alford and Ron

Horton, ‘and by the addition of

George.

a bonus.

Davidsonian: You received criti-
cism for not starting Darry Strick- .

How do yourespond to these judg-
ments?

McKillop: In the aftermath of the
experience, I contacted a number .
of people on campus who person-
ally called me or wrote to me to
express their disappointment at my
decision not to start them.

My first task upon clearly get-
ting that message was to talk to”
Darry and Turner themselves and
to let them know that if I did make
a mistake that I apologize for it. I
did not realize that it had sucha big
impact upon them.

Iapologized to them because it
did obviously have an impact and
