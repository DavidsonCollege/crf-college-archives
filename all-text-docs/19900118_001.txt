Repairs, permits and money
delay sports complex opening

Martin says problems extend beyond athletic department

By JAY CHAUDHURI

Minor repairs and budgetary
problems have delayed the
opening of most of the athletic
facilities in the Baker Sports
Complex, according to Athletic
Director Sterling
Martin. Cur-
rently, the new
gym is open pri-
marily for use by
varsity athletes,

As a result, this area is now
being recarpeted. Further-
more, equipment for the courts

rently, the pool is pending a
permanent permit from health
authorities.

While the upper level rac-
quetball courts are playable,
water has seeped into the area
around the lower level courts.

Until then, the courts remain a
safety hazard.

Another area of the new gym
that needs attention is the
weight room, which currently
has no weights. The athletic de-
partment is attempting to or-

expect to use the Johnston Gym

Students may enjoy cable services
soon if the costs of acquiring them is
not overly expensive.

Anad hoc SGA committee was es-
tablished last year to look into the
possibility of installing cable televi-
sion in the dorm lounges and Patter-
son Court houses. This year the com-
mittee, chaired by Brooks Geer, con-

a Richard Terry, Director of Resi-
dence Life stressed that cable would

be “a luxury as opposed to a neces-
sity.”

Terry said that when he got to
Davidson, there was a file on cable
TV and that investigations had been
done. Nothing was decided, how-
ever, and Terry said that he wasa
little “gun shy” about the project.
“There is no guarantee that it will
happen. "

Lakeside will be giving the college
an estimate on the cost of laying the
ground cable; and if a proposal is
