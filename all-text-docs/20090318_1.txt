Last week, Associate Profes-
sor of Political Science Russell
Crandall accepted a position as
ptincipal director for the Western
Hemisphere at the Department of
Defense (DoD).

Professor Crandall’s work at the
DoD begins in late April. His job
will focus on three critical areas:

to oversee the U.S.’s military pres-_

ence in the Western Hemisphere; to
cultivate strong relationships with
our counterparts in the hemisphere;
and to represent the DoD in the
interagency process, in which the
State Department, National Secu-
rity Council (NSC) and DoD meet
to determine policy formulation.

No stranger to governmental
policymaking, Crandall worked for
the NSC in 2004 and 2005. There
he learned a humble take on policy
development.

“Policy is the realm of the pos-
sible,” he said. “It leads to a more
pragmatic and empathetic ap-
proach. But it’s not easy.”

Crandall says his experience
with policymaking at the NSC in-
formed his outlook on teaching as a
Davidson College professor.

“It’s one thing to identify a so-
lution,” Crandall said. “But it’s an-
other thing to get it implemented.
Here, the consequences of what I
say and think are pretty low. But in
policy, they can be tremendous.

“When you’re right you’re
right, when you’re wrong you’re
wrong.”

When asked how he felt about
returning to the arena of policy-
making, Crandall admitted to feel-
ings of excitement, honor and ap-
prehension.

“It’s a tremendous honor to
serve my country, and it’s also very
exciting. But at the same time, giv-
en the portfolio and given the task
at-hand, it’s very daunting,” Cran-
dall said.

“Unlike academia, we have real
consequences there. Just because |
have the job doesn’t mean I’m go-

Consultants to assess energy practices

Will advise College on inefficiencies and prospects for solar installations

BriaN Moran
Editor-in-Chief

Davidson has hired two inde-
pendent consultants to conduct
evaluations. of the College’s energy
use and assess opportunities for so-
lar. energy installations. Advanced
Energy Corporation (AEC), a Ra-
leigh-based non-profit corporation
that conducts clean energy research,
began a campus-wide audit of en-
ergy consumption in February and
will report corrigible inefficiencies
by the end of the semester. Steven
Strong of Solar Design Associates
(SDA) , a renewable energy design
firm based in Harvard, Mass., will
appraise prospects for solar ther-
mal and photovoltaic (PV) panels
later this spring. Both projects are
funded by commitments from The
Duke Endowment and take place in
the context of the school’s “Year of
Sustainability.”

“Generally, energy efficiency
is the most cost effective way to
reduce your electricity use” Sus-
tainability Fellow Kealy Devoy ’08
said. Devoy hopes the audit will

find inefficiencies that the school
can easily rectify.

“There may be inefficiencies
that we’ve overlooked and could
address as early as this summer,”
she said. “There may also be some
long term things that are more capi-
tal intensive and we’ll have to fig-
ure out how to fund those.”

Solar Design Associates has not
yet begun its analysis of potential
solar options on Davidson’s cam-
pus. When founder Steven Strong
begins the evaluation he will as-
sess possibilities for two types of
technologies: solar thermal water
heating and solar photovoltaic, or
the capture of electricity from solar
energy.

“Solar thermal currently has
more energy potential and experi-
ence than solar photovoltaic does,”
David Holthouser, director of engi-
neering and facilities management,
said in an email. “Our strategy is to
use our rooftops for solar thermal
because because the thermal use
will sit directly underneath.”

Davidson would likely face
somewhat of a challenge in retro-

fitting buildings with solar-capture
devices, as the majority of cam-
pus structures have roofs that face
east-west, and the greatest amount
of solar energy is captured from
southern facing exposure. The so-
lar thermal option is particularly at-
tractive because of new technology
known as “Thin-film” which can
function with only indirect solar
exposure. Furthermore, Thin-film
comes in the form of roof tiles and
many of Davidson’s buildings use
tiled roofs.

Through satisfying water-heat-
ing demands, a solar thermal instal-
lation would help reduce David-
son’s consumptions of natural gas.
While natural gas has a relatively
low emission rate, it is one of the
more expensive forms of energy.

“We’re looking at solar thermal
not only because its more efficient,
but its more cost-effective and the
payoff time is much shorter,” Hol-
thouser said.

Holthouser is hopeful that Da-
vidson could undertake a cost-ef-

” Last Friday, Laura Bergner”09
was awarded the Watson Fellow-
ship for the 2009-2010 fellowship
year. “It still feels surreal, but I’m
really excited,” Bergner said of
her reaction to winning this pres-
tigious fellowship which offers
up to 50 graduating college se-
niors a one year grant of $28,000
for independent study and travel

outside of the United States.

This year only forty fellows
were chosen, so the Thomas J.
Watson Foundation’s selection
process was even more competi-
tive. The foundation’s mission is
“to offer college graduates of un-
usual promise a year of indepen-
dent, purposeful exploration and
travel outside of the United States
in order to enhance their capacity
for resourcefulness, imagination,
openness and leadership and to
foster their humane and effective
participation in the world com-
munity.”

Dr. Malcolm Campbell, as-
sociate professor of Biology and
director of Davidson’s James G.
Martin Genomics Program, was 2
Watson Fellow in 1984 and now
helps Davidson to select its nomi-
nees.

Campbell said, “My Watson
year was the 6th most influential
event in’ my life: my birth, my
parents’ divorce, my matrriage,
daughter number 1, daughter
number 2, Watson year. I am cer-
tain Laura will continue to reap.
the benefits of her wanderjahr for
decades.”

No Davidson students were
awarded the fellowship last year,
but 2007-2008 fellows were Omer
Hashmi, who studied Muslim im-
migrant communities, and Amy
Reid, who studied multi-racial
identity,

Bergner’s fellowship will
depart from her Davidsonian
predecessors’ focus on human
relationships to investigate some
particularly controversial. crea-
tures—bats. Her proposal is en-
titled “Chasing Bats and Their
Shadows,” and she plans to travel
to Costa Rica, China, Thailand,
the Philippines, Madagascar and
Fiji to study these “ecologically
important and misunderstood ani-
mals.”

A Biology major, Bergner has
conducted research in both labo-
ratory and field settings at David-
