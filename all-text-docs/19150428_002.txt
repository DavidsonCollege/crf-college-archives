P. B. Price........ Assignment Editor| will be heard with sorrow throughout

the State. She was a woman of excep-
tionally fine character; a woman of high
refinement, broad culture and broader
charity; a woman whose mission was to

‘Help Somebody Today’ and to help
them in the sweetest. kindest and most
generous way.”

Tt will be remembered that Mr.
Watts has given to Davidson the Watts
Dormitory, and he also made the largest
single gift toward. the building of the
Martin Chemical Laboratory.

Dr. Martin will attend the funeral of
Mrs. Watts in Durham today.

DR. WUNDER TC LEAVE.

Prof. Charles N. Wunder. who has
heen Associate Professor of Applied
Mathematics for. the past two years,
leaves Davidson at the end of the pres-
ent session. Professor Wunder has en-
deared himself to all by his eentlemanly
aualities and ‘interest in student activi-
ties. He has served the college well,
and his host of friends here wish him
every success in his future work.

Dr. Wunder came only for two years.
He could not accept a permanent posi-
tion on account of the fact that he was
not a Preshvterian. Davidson is grate-
‘ul to the Methodists for lending him
for this short period.

Charlottesville, Va.. a graduate of the
University of Virginia of three years’
standing, cames ta Davidson next Fall
eo fill the place left vacant by Professor
Wunder.

ace and unmarried. He has been in the
field for the past three vears as a civil
engineer, and is caw with the DuPont

OUR GUESTS.

With a talk straight from the should-
er, Coach Fetzer brought clearly before
us last weck our duty in the way of the
treatment of the visiting teams. At the
same time he spoke a word as to the way
in which we should regard athletics—
not allowing our desire for victory to
overcome the real end of true sport.

It is only a team which represents a
college, which is able to fully understand
the varietv of treatment which is offered
by the different colfyges. ‘They carry
away with them a distinct impression of
the character of the students, from the
spirit in which they are received. There-
fore for purely selfish’ reasons, if we have
no other, we should accord them the best

treatment possible. But. when we con-
sider that far more important fact, that
they come to us as our guests, and as
such, should be received with the utmost
cordiality, we need dwell no longer upon
this point. We then begin to realize the
full force of the cemarks made by Coach
Fetzer. We will make no mistake in
following him in this matter, as in other
things which he mav advocate.
