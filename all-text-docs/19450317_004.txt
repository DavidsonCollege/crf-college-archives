“Think On
These Things”

By Ed Golden

Psychologists tell us that the vi-
vidness of our memory depends on
the stress of attention. Therefore,
says St. Paul, “if there be any vir-
tue, if there be any praise, think
on these these
of St. Paul, in »
mind, I shall endeavor to make this

things!’ Keeping

immortal words

column of interest to all by supply-
ing food for thought that we often
hear, but seldom take into consi-

deration.

One of the most thought provok-

ing sermons that the student body
has had the privilege to hear Was
delivered by the Rev. George Mau-
ze on.Feb. 18. Dr. Mauze began
by telling us that the philosophy
of life of most Americans is to
travel through life with the wind
at our backs. To travel hither and
yon, nonchalantly, regardless of the
rights of others. He compared. the
four winds to the different types of
students. Which are you like? There
is the east wind, the wind of ignor-
ance. The east wind breeds corryp-
tion in political. circles, permeates
our literature in the various pulp
magazines. Then the south winds,
not quite as dangerous, but the
wind of selfish indulgence. The west
wind ‘fails to’ meet the challenge
of simplicity and purpose. If we con-
tinue to ride with these winds,
we will reap the harvest of sin,
corruption, and all ‘manner of evil.
Lets face the north wind, which is
a token of Strong moral courage.
It was the wind our forefatheré
faced when they were developing
our country. Let’s nof* let
down.

them

Last Sunday evening Dr, J. R.
Cunningham gave another of his
unusually fine messages. It con-
cerned the attitudes essential to
peace. Dr. Cunningham began» by
giving several instances of the pre-
vailing interest that young people
have for the coming peace. Peace
is a positive thing, not negative. It
must be dealt with intelligently.
America has never gone all out
for peace, as it has for war. It seems
foolish to pay such a price in men,
material and moral resources, We
should endeavor in the future to
make it 2 subject of deepest in-
terest, Four attitudes are essential
to everlasting peace. First of all is
the attitude about war, the price of
war is too great tobe constantly
waging war. Second‘is the attitude
toward money. The material cost
of war. The inflation of Many our
countries economic systems. Third:
our attitude toward the people of
the world? Last is our attitude to-
ward Jesus Christ. Are we going to
continue in our complacent manner.
Thinking of the things of this world.
Think of these things !
