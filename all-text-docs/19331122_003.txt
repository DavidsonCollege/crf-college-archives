THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 22, 1933

Dr. Gwynn Directs
Devotional Group

Subject of “Seeing Across Social
Barriers” Discussed in an
Informal Meeting

At the first of a series of Y. M.
C. A. devotinoal study groups, held at
9 o'clock last Friday night in the So-
cial Center, Dr. P. H. Gwynn discussed
with the group of about thirty fresh-
men gathered there the subject, “See-
ing Across Social Barriers.”

“Duck” Powell introduced Dr.
Gwynn, who opened the meeting with
a short prayer, followed by the read-
ing of. several portions of St. Luke’s
Gospel dealing with the topic of the
evening. These Bible verses gave a
picture of the social barriers during
Christ's ministry and the manner in
which they conflicted with His teach-
ings.

Dr. Gwynn did not attempt to lec-
ture on the subject, but left the dis-
cussion and development of the ques-
to the members of the group
themselves. Several practical, thought-
provoking questions were offered for
comment by Dr. Gwynn in relation to
the application of Christ’s teachings in
our modern social life «with its barriers,
and various opinions were offered and

tion

commented upon by the group.

This was the first of a series of
eight religious topics to be discussed
at the regular 7 o’clock weekly devo-
tional study group meetings at the So-
cial Center. It is planned to have a
faculty member or upperclassman lead
these study groups each Friday night,
at least until those attending the meet-
ings feel capable of carrying on the
discussion among themselves.

Sam Wiley and “Duck” Powell,
originators and leaders of the idea, ex-
pressed favorable comments on the

success of the first meeting and cor-
dially urge all freshmen interested in
the plan to attend the next discussion
group.

New Instruments Will
Improve Davidson Band

The Davidson Band is to have two
new instruments added to its ranks
this week. This addition came about
through the purchase of an Alto clari-
net bysMarshall Sanford, and a string
bass by James Crooks. Both these in-
struments have been greatly needed
by the band,

There are very few bands that can
boast of these instruments. This marks
a start toward a symphonic instru-
mentation for the Davidson Band. It
was stated that additional instruments
of unusual character will be secured
soon,

Reported This Week

Last Thursday night, three thieves
stole sixty-three chickens and six tur-
keys from the chicken house of Cald-
well Bradford, a farmer who lives a
short distance from here on Concord
Road.

The leader among the robbers was
Jim Morrison, white. He and his two
negro accomplices, Al Sloan and Tom
Allison, each received eighteen months
on the road when they were convicted
Monday in local court.

On Thursday and Friday nights, Dr.
P. H. Gwynn had his brief case, cur-
tains, tools, and money he had left in
his car stolen while he was at supper.
Ed Linker, the Davidson marshal, has
found no clues as yet, but he believes

by the same group or individual.

DR. LACY CONCLUDES
ANNUAL “Y” SERVICES

(Continued from page 1)

“The next characteristic which
makes a man is courage,” Dr. Lacy
continued, “God needs men who have
backbones and courage enough to
withstand temptation. It takes bold-
ness to become a Christian.
“Another phase which goes into the
making a a man is thought. We must
think things out for ourselves. If
problems of our life are to be solved,
they must be thought out.”

Dr. Lacy concluded this discussion
by bringing out the point that men
cannot build themselves without hav-
ing influence on the life of others with
whom they come in contact.

The chapel exercises on Monday
morning were conducted by Dr. Lacy,
at which time he developed further
the topic, “Being a Man.” The main
point which the speaker emphasized
was that we must have strong bodies
to become strong men. Quoting from
Paul, Dr. Lacy said, “Our bodies are
the temples of God.” The speaker
added, “We should have ideals and
our chief ideal should be God. The
Bible reads that Jesus grew in stature.
Through our bodies we transmit life
to others and therefore we should keep
our bodies-clean-and pure.” Dr. Lacy
in conclusion spoke of the things which
keep us from having strong bodies, and
emphasized the necessity of getting a
sufficient amount of sleep, being care-
ful to guard over-eating, and with-
standing the alcoholic and sexual
temptations.

Dr. Lacy spoke to the students again
on Monday night and explained fur-
ther the necessity of thought in the
building of a man, “We must in-
crease in wisdom, and in order to do
this we must acquire knowledge,” the
speaker declared. “Today is the time
when our minds are expanding. Don’t
wait until? you finish college before
you increase your knowledge, but do
it now!”

Dr. Lacy stressed in conclusion that
after you have increased in wisdom,
do not keep it for yourself, but make
use’ of it to benefit oth¢rs and thus
increase the Kingdom of God.

What are the best ten years of a
wottan’s life ?

Between 28 and 30.
