The Dean Rusk Program
What is next for Hussein and Iraq?

By Graham Ernst

Five years ago, Baghdad was
one of the most prosperous capi-
tals inthe Middle East. City streets
flourished with trade and economic
development. Today, those same
streets are scattered with flea mar-
kets where families sell everything
they have to avoid hunger. Sewers
overflow onto cracked streets, and
thousands of children face malnu-

‘trition without adequate medicine
‘or health facilities.

Since the United Nations Se-
curity Council placed sanctions on
Iraq barring all international trade,
Iraq has been unable to cash in on
its $15 billion a year oil resources.
Because Iraq’s economy is based
solely on its oil exports and foreign
imports, the entire economy has
collapsed under the weight of the
trade embargo.

While the UN sanctions have
been effective in dismantling Iraq’s
chemical and nuclear weapons pro-
gram as well as their SCUD mis-
sile capabilities, the source of the
problem, President Saddam
Hussein, remains strongly en-
trenched in his position. As a re-
sult, several nations who backed
former President Bush’s coalition
for sanctions and subsequent inva-
sion of Kuwait in 1991 have shown
that they are willing to lift the

sanctions against Iraq.

President Clinton and the |

U.S. remain steadfast in their
opposition to lifting the sanc-
tions. However, Russia, China,
and France—all of whom hold
permanent seats on the UN Se-
curity Council with the U.S.—
would benefit from renewing
arms and oil trade with Iraq. In
fact, Russia offered a plan fol-
lowing Hussein’s latest build-up
and withdrawal near the Kuwaiti
border that would lift the trade

embargo. The U.S. refused to,

support the plan as it poured
more than 40,000 troops into
Kuwait.

Russia, France, and China
cite Iraq’s compliance with UN
requirements in the sanctions as
a basis for discontinuing the
embargo. Foremost, Iraq has
recognized Kuwait’s borders as
legitimate. Second, the Moscow
News reports that Iraq has de-
stroyed its long range missile
capabilities along with its nuclear
and chemical weapons programs.
Also, Iraq made its first compen-
sation payment of $2.75 million
this past July.

By contrast, the U.S. cites
Hussein’s harsh treatment of
northern Kurds and southern
Shiites as evidence of Iraq’s dis-

regard for human rights. Also,
Hussein showed heis still a threat
to international peace with his
troop build-up near the Kuwaiti
border three weeks ago. Fi-
nally, 600 Kuwaitis are still miss-
ing from Iraq’s initial invasion
in August of 1990.

However, there is much
doubt that the sanctions still
serve a justifiable purpoSe in the
future. Hussein is not going
anywhere. As one Iraqi govern-
ment official put it, “You are
looking at people whose energy
is drained simply looking for
the next meal.” Therefore, many
are asking who the sanctions are
really hurting.

Atsome point, the U.S. will
have toconvince its partners that
the threat which Hussein poses
to the international community
is greater than the benefits that
would come from reopening his
trade doors. So far, the U.S. has
been successful in this task.
