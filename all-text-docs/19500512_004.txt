Wilson Talks on
“England Today”

The International Relations Club
held their last meeting of the year,
and -their first under the guidance
of new President Gray Hampton,
at the Sigma Chi house Tuesday
night.

The guest speaker for the eve-
ning was Professor Wilson of the
Bible department, who spoke on
“England As It Is Today.” Pro-
fessor Wilson, who is originally
from Scotland and has spent much
of his life working among the labor-
ing classes in England, put special
emphasis upon the life and geo-
graphy of England as it relates to
the difference between the urban
and agrarian classes of people. He
also spoke on the possibilities of
war and the effects it would have
on English society and basiness,
in addition to England’s chances of
surviving another war.

During the business part of the
meeting, the club voted to extend
an honorary bid of membership to
Professor Pinkney, head of the po-
litical science department here at
the college, to become an active
member of the club. This action

closed out the year’s activities.

COMMENCEMENT .

specializing in liasion work.

Mr. Rush left the army in 1946
as a colonel, and entered the State
Department as a United Nations
expert. Then came a 10-month’s
stay in the War Department, fol-

lowed in 1947 by his return to the|

State Department, where his rise
was phenomenal. Although he had
no diplomatic experience, his liber-
al arts background, keen, imagina-
tive mind, and indefatigable capa-
city for work stamped him as a
“broad-gauge outsider with a fresh
approach.” In February, 1949, he
was appointed assistant secretary
for U. N. affairs, and later became
a Deputy Undersecretary, assisting
in coordinating all the department's
work. From this important post he
was called in March of this year
