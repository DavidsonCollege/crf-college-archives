by his own choice.

Then there is the -considera-

had not been compulsory, we
would not have some of the top
cadets that we do.

Q. Do you anticipate any
further changes in the depart-

A. Well, of course there's the
flight detachment we're work-

the new green uniform for the
basic students in 1961, maybe
in ‘60.

Q. What do you think about
the band this year?

A. I think it’s one of the best
bands I've heard this year.
We've done everything we
could to make it attractive, and
I thing a real esprit-de-corps is
developing. The Honor Platoon
is also tops this year.
