Coley Windham and Dick Johnson selected by Grier

Every entry is allowed to enter as many

time or distance is better than that set as
a minimum, more points are allotted to
him, the number according to his excel-

SHOW PROMISE

Coaches Predict Wildkitten Team
To Overshadow Last
Year’s Eleven

The outlook for freshmen football this
season is very promising, the team should
really go places this year. Coach Laird
and Parks Harrison have been working
the men every afternoon, sizing up the
players, teaching them plays and stressing
blocking and tackling. The boys are
slowly rounding shape for their
opening game to be played here against
Darlington.

Prospects for the team are as fol-
lows: Ends—Hicks, Iverson and McClel-
land. Tackles—Warden, Edwards, Me-
Mullen and Moore. Guards—Miller, Gas-
tiger, Ellis. Centers—Able and McCall.
Backtield—Steere, Stair, Harrison, Rudi-
sell, Mauney,. Hand, Plonk, Edgerton,
Brown and Hunt.

The backfield has plenty of speed ‘but
are short in weight, while the line is
fairly heavy. In_ practice, and
Stair have proved themselves capable
punters, while Harrison and Stair (a
southpaw) have been doing some nice
passing. It is our belief that when these
boys have played more together that a
smooth team will be formed.

The Kittens will miss Rudisell, Hand
and Mauney in the first game as these
boys were members of the Gaston County
baseball team which won the little world
series and will attend the big series the
week of the initial game. Injuries have
retarded hard practice, so therefore little
positive information is available,

A number of games have been carded
for the Freshmen this year including’
contests with the State and Duke [‘rosh,
V. P. I. Frosh, Darlington Prep, and
one or two other teams.

The games with Duke and V, P. I.
will be played at Durham and Blacks-
burg, respectively, while State will meet
the Kittens here.

Fred Koury, former All-State end for
High School last year,
worked out with the local team for sev-
eral days but had some difficulty making
up his mind about where to attend school.
After leaving here Fred went to Elon
and played as an end against Davidson
here Saturday.

FIRST GAME OF SEASON
OVER HEAVY ELON TEAM

Varsity Game

FIRST GAME ENDS 7-0

“Teeny” Lafferty Scores Winning
Touchdown For Davidson

The 1935 version of the Davidson
Wildcats took the gridiron on a blister-
ing hot Saturday afternoon and showed
their heavier Elon
eleven to the tune of a 7-0 victory for the
"Cats.

With less than a minute to play in
the first half, “Teeny” Lafferty, flashy
sophomore back, swept wide around left
end behind a perfect interference to the
ten yard marker, where he left his block-
ers, shook off four would-be tacklers,
and crossed the double for the
only touchdown of the afternoon, Pitt-
man kicked the extra point. Lafferty,
playing his first varsity game as an un-
derstudy for “Midge” Verble, was sent in
about two minutes before the half time.
On the tenth play after he was sent in,
he scored.”

The lines of the two tédms were pretty
evenly balanced in weight, but the Wild-
cat linemen showed greater strength in
the latter part of the game, when they
opened enormoys holes in the Elon wall.
In the Christian line, Hartsell and Taus-
ett caused the Red and Black machine
the. most trouble, Dick Johnson
and Morris Freeman threw the Elon
backs for numerous losses. Newsome and
Abbitt furnished Elon’s offensive drive,
and Jack Stallings shone brilliantly on
defense. The best 'Cat backfield combina-
tion seemed to be that composed of Fred
Dennis and “Teeny” Lafferty,
mores from Concord, and Paul Pittman
of Barium Springs.

Coach “Peahead” Walker’s
touted passing attack was so well checked
by Coach Doc. Newton's 6-2-2-1 defense
that the Christians completed only three
out of fourteen attempted passes, and
those for only twenty-two yards. In the
meantime, Davidson completed two passes
out of eight for a total gain of thirty-
six yards.

Elon’s real threat of the game came
