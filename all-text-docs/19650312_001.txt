gton.

His topic Wednesday night
was “‘A Liberal View of Sex,”
but the discussion proved to be
only a preview. since sex was
not discussed all evening. Good-
man did air many liberal views
on other topics, however. He be-
gan by discussing his involve-
ment in the recent ‘Free
Speech’’ movement at Berkley,
including his views on student
government.

He felt that student govern-

‘{ment in this country is almost

powerless. He did cite one in-
stance in which students, by
striking, were able to oust an
undesirable president. He com-
mented, however, that ‘‘these
things are must better when
they have faculty support!"
On the fraternity question,
Goodman stated that he saw no
sense to national fraternities,
but was in favor of cooperative
student living arrangements.

But all this was really pre-
liminary to Goodman's discus-
sion of ‘Sexual Ethics.’’ which
came in Thursday chapel and
the customary coffee after-
wards. Goodman, who has been
a contributor to the Playboy
“Forum, launched his discus-
sion with the categorical state-
ment, “Moral rules are not the
way to teach sexual responsibil-
ity.”

In fact, he accepts only three
rules for sexual behavior:
“Don't exploit another person's
feelings, see to it that you don’t
have an unwanted child, and
make sure that you're being
true to yourself in your sexual
relationships.”

the “Playboy style relationship"
and stick to sexual involvement
only where there is also emo-
tional involvement.

On the subject of unwanted
children Goodman commented,
“If my daughter came home
pregnant from college, I would
be furious . . . because we'd
have to baby-sit!’ Goodman's
final warning was against sex-
ual relationships as ‘‘conquests”’
for boys and ‘‘popularity-build-
ers” for girls.

Goodman then identified him-
self with Thomas Aquinas’ three
reasons for sexual behavior:
“natural instincts, getting to
know another person, and pleas-
ure.’’ Pleasure, as Goodman de-
fined it, involves commitment,
personal engagement. Stated
Goodman, “If an activity is
pleasurable, by and large it is

Report of the Commitee on Review of Fraternity
Questions, Wiillams College, May 5, 1962

In Davidson's fraternities the mem-
bers have for years found an adequate
social program. And within his fra-
ternity’s membership, the fraternity
man usually has found that small
group which included his closest
friends.

Further, the fraternities have help-
ed their freshman members adjust
to college Hfe in general, and to
Davidson in particular. By emphasiz-
ing grade-point averages, the fraterni-
ties have succeeded in bolstering their
members academically.

Consequently, we have no difficulty
understanding those who say that
Davidson’s approach of eat-in-the-
houses-but-live-in-the-dorms has led to

Harrington, Todd Run For Editorship

A philosophy major from
Winston-Salem, Harrington
served this year as manag-
ing editor of THE DAVID-
SONIAN. Last year he serv-
ed as editor of The Epslion-
ian for Pi Kappa Phi; his
freshman year he belonged
to the freshman debate
team and was a feature writ-
er for THE DAVIDSONIAN.
Harrington has also been
head football manager for
two years and is a member
of the “D” Club.

THE DAVIDSONIAN can and
should more effectively stimu-
late comment on campus and
national issues and assert stu-
dent opinion. If elected editor
I will do my best to make this
newspaper a more effective
voice of the Davidsen student
body.

Student opinion, properly or-
ganized and presented, can be
made into an effective political
and intellectual force at David-
son College. To achieve this end
and to increase its news cover-
age of campus events, THE
DAVIDSONIAN needs _ several
changes:

First, comprehensive cover-
age of all campus news events
and appropriate editorial! action
requires that THE DAVIDSON-
ION be gotten out on time, at a
regular time each week. I would
reorganize the newspaper staff
and make certain procedural
changes to insure that a 6 page
(budget permitting) THE DA-

VIDSONIAN is delivered to each
student by midnight Friday.
Second, an efficient voice of
student action and opinion must
establish closer contacts with
the Student Council, IFC and
College Union so that student
activity and thought might be
co-ordinated to their most effec-
tive use. In addition to improv-
ed news coverage of these or-
ganizations, I would allot space
regularly to their presidents
that they might explain their ac-
tivities directly to the students
through the newspaper.

The independent editorial com-
ment and news coverage would
not be impaired by these chang-
es. I think that my three years
on newspaper staffs quali-
fies me for the editorship and
shows that the changes are prac-
tical.

1 favor expansion of the or-
ganized social program of the
entire student body witheut un-
fair penalties being placed on
the fraternity system. I believe
that aay changes in the fnater-
nity system should be first ap-
proved by a. majority of stu-
dents—and I will oppose with ev-
ery means possible any changes
in the fraternity system that are
not first approved in a referen-
dum of the entire student body.

Finally, if I am elected edi-
tor, I will do everything within
my power to make THE DAVID-
SONIAN, this “‘editorial voice of
the Davidson student body’’, the «
outstanding college newspaper.

Todd, a history major
from Gastonia considering
a career in journalism, has
been managing editor of
THE DAVIDSONIAN for the
past year. During his fresh-
man year, Todd won the D.
G. Martin Award for Out-
standing Reporting. He re-
cently received a Wall

mer’s internship with a dai-

move to respectable journalism
on campus.

I would continue this six-page
weekly format: however, some
problems which have arisen
need to be eliminated:

—Late deliveries are plainly
an inconvenience to all con-
cerned. Furthermore, a day-old
newspaper loses much of its
newsworthiness. Deliveries in
the dorms should be restored to
a reasonable Friday night hour.

~—Perhaps the weakest part of
this year's newspaper has been
the extra editorial page. I would

Substitute a feature page, along
the lines of a Sunday “feature
front’ in many daily newspa-
pers, to alternate every other
week with the second sports
page.

-—Many extra hours are spent
correcting the articles of repert-
ers who know only the beginning
points about journalism. This
can be avoided and the readabil-
ity of the newspaper improved
by simply making an effort to
help these writers improve their
journalistic style.

There should be a more equit-
able arrangement among cam-
pus publications concerning the
use of the Union darkroom. A
more satisfactory pooling of
equipment and supplies must be
made for the sake of time and
expenses.
