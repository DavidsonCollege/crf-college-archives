lege has asked its friends “‘to stretch
its support” for the college. Con-
tributions have ranged from a few
dollars to almost 7 million dollars.
He explained, that the campaign
hasalready had“‘more benefits than
just the money,” because the effort
has “involved more people i in the
college and its mission.”

Bethea also said that the stu-
dent advisory committee has been

formed to gather student input and
Bethea said that their contributions
have been valuable.

ever catch up with places like
