JACKSON LEADS DISCUSSION
Explains ABM to interested students.

Lunch-Table Talk Collects
20 For ABM Diseussion

By STEVE ROADY
Staff Weiter

The first of the “hinch-ta-
ble talks" organized by Chap:
lain Septt Woodmansee. a
discussion of the .antl-ballfs-
tie missile question led by
Dr. Willian BE. Jackson, was
well recolved by students
Wednesday.

The 20 or so students clus.
tered around Jackson's cafe-
teria table heard him say a
more basic question underlies
the debate as to whether or
ar not even a limited’ ABM
aystem should be Installed in
the United States.

The real issue hinges on
whether or not one accepts
the “rough parity’ hypothe-
sig concerning an arms race
or whether one believes that
a certain military superiority
can he estublished by ane
side or the other, said Jack-
son.

When one student suggest-
ed that the purpose of the
ABM systsem might be to
develop in defense ugainst av-
cluar attack, Jackson stated

that he feels it te be Impos-
sible to construct such a de:
fense against Russian
ICBM's. The ABM systom
might possibly prove effec:
tive against an attack by the
ICRM’'s which Chiaa will have
in the mid 1970's, he said, but
such an attack would amount
tn suicide for the Chinese,
and he therefore docs not
Ice! that they are prepared to
do that.

Jn rogard to China, Jack-
son sees a real danger in that
the threat of Chinese limited-
strike capability might push
the United States and the So:
viet Union into an ever-esca-

history — received thorough attention in the interview.

The reasons, sccording to the blacks themselves,
were mainly psychological or economic in nature.

“But black children,” Brown spoke first, “that
grow up in this country: you can take a black child
three years old and you can give that child a group
of clothes — some clothes for janitors, and business
executives. You give him a white doll and a black
doll and tell him to dress those dolls, and that black
child will dress that black man in the janitor's clothes
and... the white man in business man’s clothes.

“Now there’s something wrong somewhere. You
look at the families.

‘If 1 were to sit there and say something about
your parents and talk about your mother and call
her everything but a child of God, and (if) I talked
about your father and called him everything but a
child of God, you'd probably get more angry with
me if I said more about your father.

“Pat it's different among black people.

“If you ever want to get into a fight with a black
ian, say something about his mother. And if you ever
want to get into a fight with a white man, you talk
dbout his father.”

“The reason for that,” Williams said, “is that the
black father has never known his role iv this society,
and it's because of the white man's inculeation: Th
white man has taught everybody, even the blac
man himself, that he has nothing.

“But the women always told the black man what
to do. and this is the reason why there is so much
unrest in the black home today. ;

‘I'm talking about the white race in general:
they’re really going to look at themselves and see what
they've done. [ mean those deep down things that they
have really done, And they're going to, have Co bea
that brunt. That's their burden.”

“And if you ask yourself, why did this actually
come about?" Parks asked. “There's only one reason,
and it’s obvious to me: pure greed. the desire for
profit.

“Why was slavery in the United Stales the ulti-
mate cruelty, whereas in Latin America the slaves
were just working for the guy and had all rights of a
citizen-and everything else?

“In the United States it was completely differant:
it was total, complete domination. And the reason for
it was that the white inan in this country found out
that he could make great profits in the plantation
system with totally subservient slaves.

“In order to do this he’s got to awe the slave
with his power and his money and his knowledge of
things foreign to the slave.

“He’s got to downgrade the slave’s background.
his ideas, everything. You've got to tell him that he
has no heritage and that what little heritage he does
have is bad.

“He’s got to separate the family, he’s got to
make the man a nothing. Becatise so long as the man
is wayne his logical role, then you have no slave
really.’ .

“The church has played a beautiful role in that
the church first of all didn't say anything about slav-:
ery, and then it recognized the institution of slavery
and considered it to be a means of instilling civiliza-
tion into the slaves,”

Williams interrupted. “Then the white man has
then the audacity to say: ‘Why won't this Negro man
get up and take some gumption himself and get a
joh?’ 7.

_ “TI think one good thing in the black revolution
is that the black man is finally coming into his own,”
Parks added.
