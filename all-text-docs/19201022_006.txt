will and do it. A moment's consid-
cration will show us at once that
the last-named is the only natural
and normal being, and that we are
under gréat obligations to get the
others in line.

In its final analysis we see that re-
ligion is merely right relationship
to God and man, living under the
knowledge that God is our Father
and all men-our brothers, and acting
accordingly.

The second service of the cam-
paign, held at the regular vesper
service hour, was an inspiration to
these who were present. The prob-
lem of how we, the students of Da-
vidson College, could, in our daily
lives, become abler leaders of the
great cause, was discussed.

The beauty, the influence, and the
power of a strong Christian char-
acter was shown by apt illustrations.

Fine theories are all very good. but
they fade away into insignificance
when compared with the value of a‘
‘true Christian character inspiring
others to a deeper and more conse-
crated Christian life.

The way of the reformer and
Christian leader is hard, but there.
will be no real reform until Chris-
tian leaders dominate the life of the
community. Three ways by which
the spiritual life of a community.
may be uplifted were given: (1)
We may set higher moral standards
than most of the fellows have been
‘living by: something higher, nobler ;
and better than we already have.
Men are needed who can set such
examples and stand by them; (2)|

We can help men believe in God::
show -them that God’s influence
makes a great difference practically
as well as theoretically; (3) We can:
convince the whole world of the vi-
tality of Christianity by the vicari-

llive.
| Many people do not believe in,
Christianity just because we who
‘are professed Christians often fall
so far short of our ideals, and seem-
ingly try to do no better. We must
let the Spirit of Christ live in and
through us if we expect to influence
others for good.
