spoke on South Africa in Chambers Gal-

His address focused on “how. South
assert es thats Mellen pred

actually is [today].” Kahn also spoke on
“Education in Black South Africa” at the
Open Lunch in the 900 Room October 26.
Kahn says that South Africa’s racial
problem is deeply rooted in history: “Race
reared its ugly head... when the Dutch”
arrived and “came in contact with the na-
tives.” Since then everyone has had a
“racial tag” he says. These tags are perma-
nent, and dictate the structure of every-
one’s life.
Racial tags were not the only source of
friction in South African,-history. Kahn

' cited the division of Europeans in South

Africa, a split between the English speak-
ing settlers and the Afrikaaners or Boers-
settlers from France, Germany, and other

,, areas of Europe.

Kahn says “The Boers resented British
authority enormously” and in the Anglo/
Boer war, the Afrikaaners “gave the British
a good run for their money.”

Eventually British strength ‘was too

much for the Afrikaaners, and in 1910 a
Union was es-
tablished in

South Africa. As a result, restrictions were
placed on blacks, Kahn says. One example
is that “eighty percent of the population
[the blacks] were restricted to thirteen per-
cent of the land.”

When the Nationalist Party took power
in 1948, much of the segregation that had
already existed became formalized. Kahn
says, “a whole range of laws” formalized
segregation in education, hospital care, and
services “from cradle to grave.”

Today, as a result of this segregation,
Kahn says that the revolt in South Africa
has taken its toll on the educational system.
The present group of students grades kin-
dergarten through 12th “hias seen nothing
but disruption,” he says.

Kahn expressed a reserved optimism for
the future of South Africa. Kahn holds an
mental image of South Africa as acanoe on
a river, eventually making it through the

Soviet veteran finds that glasnost
has reached Davidson ROTC

By DAVID SCOTT.

This past weekend, members of
the Davidson ROTC department
took part in a ropes course exer-
cise in Statesville. The somewhat
routine outing took an interesting
turn when one of the spaces not
filled by ROTC. personnel was
filled: by Sasha Kon , eX-
change student from the Soviet
Union who has served his re-
quired two year stint in the Rus-
sian army.

Though somewhat unaccus-
tomed to Soviet citizens taking
part in the drills of the U.S. Army,
Lt. Colonel William Diehl, head
of the Davidson ROTC program,
granted Sasha permission to par-
ticipate just as he would any other
Davidson student. :

Taking into account possible
anti-Russian bias or problems
with army regulations, Sasha was
required to wear a uniform bear-
ing no official U.S. army insignia.

_ Sasha, who stated that he does
“not much like the military
spirit,” still felt it quite interesting
to note the similarity between the
American army and the one he
served at home.

It is difficult to imagine such
tolerance in the America, which
was until fairly recently domi-
nated by the opinions expressed in
early Reagan anti-Sovietrhetoric.

-To many Americans conditioned

to an automatic antagonism
against anything Russian, a So-
viet citizen anywhere near United
States soldiers should serve as
nothing more than a possible tar-
get.
The fact that Sasha is able to
attgnd Davidson, much less par-
ticipate in an ROTC exercise,
represents on a small scale some
of the greater understanding that
may be developing between two
competing superpowers.

Questions of political ideals or
international conflicts did not,
however, disrupt the Davidson
group in any way. By functioning
together, the team “handled all
obstacles of the ropes course
smoothly,” according to senior
John Black.

This course. consists of a low
ropes and a high ropes section.
The low ropes involve obstacles

mostly near to the ground includ-'

ing a twelve foot wall which each

member must scale. These serve
as preparation for the high ropes

which involve obstacles at near

tree top level.

This course is designed to re-
veal to the soldier the necessity of
subjecting his individuality to the
will and purpose of the group.

As Black noted, “In this situ-
ation you’re not thinking about
large scale conflicts or ideals but
about group cooperation and
helping your companions.”

Having served his two year stint
in the Soviet military, the rigors
and stern discipline of military
exercise were nothing new to

~ Sasha. However, the novel setting

left him, as he put it, “a little bit
uncomfortable,” thus guarantee-
ing himself the understatement of
the month award.

It must' have been strange to
line up, take orders, do push-ups
and work with the very people
who represent the power posing

‘the greatest military threat to his

own homeland. Yet for the most
part, Sasha and the other partici-
