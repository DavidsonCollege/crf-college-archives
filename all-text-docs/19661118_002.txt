Immaturity Showing

But as soon as mankind have attained the capacity of
being guided to their own improvement by conviction or
perception (a period fong since reached in all nations with
whom we need here concern ourselves), compulsion,
either in the direct form or in that of pains and penalties
for non-compliance, is no jonger admissable as a means
to their own good, and justifiable only for the security of

others.

Either John Stuart Mill was overly
optimistic about the levels mankind
has reached, or he would not have con-
sidered that Davidson need be consid-
ered in his thinking, for some students
have recently been showing an amaz-
ing incapacity to reach self-improve-
ment.

Senseless destruction of property in
the dormitories has resulted not only
in additional operating costs for the
college, but the very safety of dorm
residents has been endangered. The
most conspicuous example is that of
discharging fire extinguishers placed
on every hall. During Homecoming,
there were more than 400 girls stay-
ing in Belk Dormitory. As per usual
dance weekend procedure, there were
only two exits open. With less than
half of the extinguishers operable, the
building could have become literally
a fire trap.

THE DAVIDSONIAN has been vocal
in its advocacy of a stepped-up student
role in policy making of the college, as
well as greater freedom and less pa-
ternalism from the administration.
Doubtless the student body shares
these sentiments and would welcome
any evidence of increased administra-
tion confidence in student maturity.

But why should such concessions be
granted when such immature behavior
as setting fires in the dorms and dis-
charging fire extinguishers is going
on? It’s an old saw that freedom and
responsibility go hand-in-hand, and
the student body must show itself will-
ing and able to shoulder responsibility
by acting like adults.

True, it’s only a relative few who
indulge in such childlike antics, but
the entire student body, who, by silent-
ly observing such games, condones the
actions and therefore shares the blame
for endangering the health and safety
of other students, as well as college
property.

Last spring. the student body voted
to maintain and enforce certain Stu-
dent Body Regulations, and a Regula-
tions Court was established to carry
the regulations out. Since its inception,
though, the court has failed to try a
Single case, a pitiful testimony to stu-
dent reluctance to become involved in

J. S. Mill, On Liberty

what they consider none of their busi-
ness.

But the Regulations Court is not the
sole avenue of maintaining decorum
in the dorms. Informal pressures by
the students on a hall will often serve
as a more effective curb on destruc-
tive tendencies. But the odium is that
this means is apparently being used
just as little as is the court, if the rash
of destruction is any indication.

Students can continue to gripe about
the Victorian standards imposed on
them, but there often appears to be
justification for such paternalism. The
choice is there: Students can assume
responsibility for enforcing their con-
duct or expect the administration to
do it for them.

To have a security officer added to
the college staff to check dorms for
destruction would be doubly harmful
to student interests. Not only would it
be a humiliating blow to be treated as
children, but it would be financially
painful, in the form of increased room
rent. ,

Fight On

While U.S. Army men are dying in
Viet Nam “for democracy,” the US.
Army at Davidson seems somewhat
opposed to the principle of majority
rule, commonly associated with the
democratic ideal.

We're going to give you an alterna-
tive, the ROTC people told students in
the Advanced Program. Either you
can have two hour-and-a-half drills
and not have one on the Tuesday be-
fore Thanksgiving, or you can have
the regular three one-hour drills, in-
cluding the one scheduled for next
Tuesday.

The juniors and seniors voted al-
most unanimously to go with the two-
drill plan. So far, so good. But just
to make things official, the plan was
submitted to several freshman and
sophomore classes, where approxi-
mately 40 per cent of the people in
the classes voted to have the regular
three’ drills.

Result, ROTC students will be
marching Tuesday, as planned. And
the war goes on.

Student Role Important

Davidson College has taken a major
step forward in recognizing the true
concept of a liberal arts education,
even as the Blue Sky Committee be-
gins its undertaking of exploring the
entire question of an education.

The committee’s willingness to al-
low two non-voting student members
to participate in committee meetings
acknowledges the fact that students do
indeed have a role to play in deciding
what the liberal man consists of and
what direction the college should take
in aiming toward that goal.

The concession to student requests
is no benign capitulation; the commit-
tee was shrewd enough to invoke the
right of executive session should the
occasion demand it. Such a provision
could conceivably, though not likely,
be used to exclude the student mem-
bers from any meaningful discussion.
But THE DAVIDSONIAN is confident

that student participation will be of a
mature and thoughtful nature that
will make student exclusion unthink-
able by the committee.

A second limitation on student par-
ticipation is the provision limiting the
Student Council, and ultimately, the
student body, from having exclusive
decision of who will sit on the com-
mittee. Instead of concentrating on
finding the two most capable students,
the council is forced to find six stu-
dents of approximately equal abilities
from which the committee can choose.

This in turn reinforces the need for
students with a commitment to David-
son to make known their willingness
to work on the faculty committee, in-
stead of waiting to be sought out by
Student Council members or members
of the council’s own curriculum com-
mittee.

Growth Of A Magazine

Until Spring 1965 there was annu-
ally elected an editor of a campus
ublication known as the Seripts ‘n
Pranks, an irregularly, infrequently
appearing campus magazine that
claimed to serve as the outlet for stu-
dent creative writings, as well as being
the medium for dissemination of cam-
pus humor.

In practice, S’nP had no creative-
writings and its “humor” consisted of
crude cartoons stolen from university
humor publications and an innocuous
character known as Ches R. Cat, whose
escapades were invariably chronicled
the night preceding the copy deadline.

In the past year-and-a-half, Charlie
Vick has revitalized the entire concept
of a campus literary magazine and has
made The Miscellany, successor to
$’nP, a publication in which the entire
community can take pride.

Gone are the stolen or esoteric hu-
mor, the informal or non-existent or-
ganization and that: darned cat. In
their place is a forum for short stories,
poetry, criticism and other original
efforts.

Admittedly, the charge of irregu--

larity and infrequency can still be
levied at the magazine’s staff, but a
great deal of the blame can be laid at
the feet of students themselves, who
have failed to give The Miscellany the
support it needs and deserves to make
it a predominantly student’ publica-
ion.

Mr. Vick has handed over the reins
of his publication to two capable jun-
iors with a solid format for the future.
New editors Buddy Newsom and Ted
Winter have a sterling op ortunity to
increase even more significantly The
Miscellany’s standing not only at Da-
vidson, but in the world of letters.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Campus Rises To Defense Of Gnomes

Dear Editor:

Mister (the title is used
loosely here) Kendrick's Jet-
ter to THE DAVIDSONIAN of
last week seemed to be the in-
vective and somewnal eccen-
tric mud-slinging of a social
maniac who cannot realize
that some people get their
kicks in other ways than him-
self.

The writer possibly had
some valid, though perverted,
advice for a fuller life, but
his style and random cries of

“witch” completely negated
this.

Who among us emerged un-
scathed? Who is pure? Who?
Indeed. who is in Mr. Ken.
drick’s circle of friends if he
uses those rantings as a cri-
terion. Poor Mr. Kendrick.

The paragraph I decry most
was the finger-pointing, almost
public naming. of specific
gnomic creatures on campus.

Old George Shaw and his
frisbee flinging five (or how-
ever many) are to be hence
forth ostracized. Wait a min-
ute! The gentleman = said
stamped out, didn’t he? Oh,
my God, George! Run! We'll
all be with you soon.

What raked up his verbiage
of that non-love letter is hard
to guess, Possibly some gnome
beat him out of his position on
a ‘grad school’ team. Maybe
he wanted to tell us that he
dislikes all ‘“‘intellectual”
term-users. Or, could it be
verbal tears over his inability
to grow a beard? I would sug-
gest, then, a mustache, Mr.
Kendrick.

Letter Points Out
Educational Lack

Dear Editor:

I consider the stupidity of
Mr. Kendrick’s letter to be
obvious, but the important and
pathetic aspect of the letter is
what it indicates about the
potency of the Davidson edu-
cational process.

Unfortunately, Mr, Ken-
drick’s views appear at the
very time some: students are
trying to demonstrate student
maturity and responsibility.

We must. repudiate Ken-
drick’s letter, but we should
not ignore what it clearly in-
dicates.

Campus ‘Giant’ Is
Gnome Counterpart

Dear Editor:

A caprice has come to the
Davidson College campus —
a caprice that is often attack.
ed, but because of its devotees.
is still electrically alive.

This song unfortunately en-

compasses the periphery of
humanity, the paragons 0°
mankind, the epitomes of
knowledgability, the  ultra-
cool, the lions, the cream:
these are none other than (and
may God eternally bless them)
the giants.

Now some of you, particu-
larly lower classmen, are prob-
ably wondering what manner
of man (aye, and more than
a man) this is. I will do my
best to explain their mode of
existence in the following list
of giant characteristics:

FEW HOURS

1.) A giant studies as few
hours as possible, devoting
another three to six to sleep.
The rest of his day is devoted
to loafing, goofing off, and
occasionally going to classes,
to which he carries as little as
is necessary and sometimes
less,

2.) The typical giant does all

in his power to remain incon-
spicuous in class and unknown
to his professors so he will not
be called on.

He often succeeds; after all,
why should an educated, in-
telligent teacher go out of his
way to recognize a student
who neither has interest nor
‘has prepared his lesson?

ALL NIGHTERS

3.) The giant may stay up
all night. often making noise
to bother the people who are

in bed by 2:30 a.m.

4.) The giant dates often —
at least every weekend and
many times during the week.
He realizes, of course, that no
girl can possibly be as great
or as cool as he, but he likes
to humor the female sex
mevertheless. He has no trou-
ble talking to them: he knows
how to handle women.

5.) The giant may or may
not be athletic, but he invari-
ably thinks that he is. If he
is, he spends so much time
improving his body that his
mind must be pushed along by
a tutor. .

INCENSED

6.) When a term paper is
assigned, he waits until two
days before it is due to start
writing it. then becomes in-
censed when all the books have
not been returned. to the li-
brary for his benefit.

7.) The giant is always short
on notes because he cuts so
many classes. He expects those
who do attend class regularly
to lay their notes at his feet.

8.) His mid-week entertain-
ment consists of a trip or
three up the road. while on
weekends he attends parties
with great bands where he
stands around smoking an oc-
casional cigarette, trying to
out-cool everyone else there.

FRATERNITY ONLY

9.) The giant's activities
(extracurricular and  other-
wise) consist of fraternity.

He would not be caught dead
attending Open End, growing
a beard, smoking a pipe. or
throwing a Frisbee — all of
which are uncool. (This is not
to imply that all fraternity
men are giants; most of them
are men.)

10.) He neither approves nor
disapproves of chapel speak-
ers; he cuts 12 (or 13) chap-
els and sleeps through the
rest.

11.) He is not upset by noise
from.the stadium or concert
which filters into the library
because he spends so little
time there.

HIGHLY ANNOYED

He is highly annoyed, how-
ever, by strains of Bach, Han-
del, or Mozart heard quietly
in the dorm.

12.) The giant becomes. very
upset when he realizes as a
sen:or that he has not worked
for three years and cannot get
into graduate school. He will
think of a dozen other excuses
for his failure, though.

13.) His voting record is sol-
idly against all that the trus-
tees and administration en-
dorse, be it good, bad, or in-
different.

14.) He stays with the “in”
crowd by senselessly cutting
classes and overcutting chapel
and by getting at least one
parking ticket a month.

15.) No one knows if he ever
showers because he is never in
his room.

UNDERCLASSMEN

Underclassmen, hear me out.
(sorry, upperclassmen — too
late): if you see any of the
above characteristics in your-
self, cut it out.

The trouble is that both
gnomes and giants are so self-
centered that they fail to see
themselves as they are.

I'm not trying to stamp out
either giants or gnomes on
this campus—a few of each

are needed to keep life inter-
esting. But there are already
a few of each here; let’s stop
the spread.

Junior Proposes
Gnome Affairs Post

Dear Editor:

In reference to Mr. Ken-
drick's gnome letter in last
week's issue of THE DAVID-
SONIAN, I would like to sug-
gest that an official campus
Office of Gnome Affairs be set
up with Mr. Kendrick as Head
Gnome Designator.

No organizational plans have
been formulated yet, but I
think that one important job
of this new office would be to
protect ‘“normal’’ Davidson
students from gnomes by re-
quiring that all students offi-
cially designated as gnomes
by Kendrick be required to
wear a scarlet ‘“‘G’’ emblaz-
oned upon their chest.

This, I think, would be a sig-
nificant initial step in helping
to remove the gnome menace
‘from the Davidson campus.

Gnomes Backbone’
Of Campus: Slade

Dear Editor:

The Gnome is the intellec-
tual backbone of a notoriously
anti-intellectual campus. It is
his academic reputation that
gets us, the hangers-on, into
the best graduate schools.

I'm afraid that I cannot ac-
cept criticism of someone be-
cause his study habits are
better than my own, and I am
quite frankly shocked at the
awful narrowness of Mr. Ken-
drick’s mind.

Rhea Sees Eleazer
Opposite Kendrick

Dear Editor:

I hope there's enough beer in
Marburg to pacify the ecstatic
fit that will seize Holmes El.
eazer after he reads Bill Ken-
drick’s denunciation of ‘the
dirge”’ that supposedly has in-
fected the Davidson Campus,
the gnome.

One gets the impression from

Kendrick’s article that the next
desired step is the formation
of the G.G.G. (the Glu Glux
Glan) a society whose main
function will be the declara-
tion of and execution of all
‘such Davidson students. The
execution would probably be
carried out in at least two
ways.

If a gnome is ugly and gno-
my -enough to make Kendrick
or any other G.G.G. member
sick enough when he happens
to pass him on campus, he
would be murdered right there
on the spot.

OBSERVATION

If the gnome is not quite
this gnomy, then he and other
accused gnomes would be tak-
en out in the middle of Lake
Norman and thrown over the
side of the boat. If they sink
they're definite gnomes, if not
they would be put under ob-
servation for a two-month peri-
od.

Switching the scene of this
discussion somewhat drastic-
ally, I read in the Nov. 11 issue
of THE DAVIDSONIAN that
Mr. Eleazer has been playing
for his Goethe Institute bas-
ketball team.

Now I'm sure that he found
this game played in a very
different manner from that in
which a Davidson game is con-

ducted, but I'm sure it remind-
ed him in some fashion of Da-
vidson which I thought he
wanted to obliterate from his
memory.

REMINISCENCE

How he could have time for
reminiscence of the “little
world,” when he and his col-
leagues are so completely tak-
en up with the disruption of
West Germany’s coalition gov-
ernment and Germany's Fran-
cophile foreign policy is be-
yond me.

Mr. Eleazer writes of the
students in Marburg: “Their
concern for themselves, their
goals and their world is bred
from their freedom, and it is
genuine, serious concern.”

1 would like to ask Mr. Ele-
azer to take a count of the
number of different faces he
sees enter any departmental
library in Marburg in any
regularly repeated fashion dur-
ing the course of one semes-
ter there. If his count exceeds
25 I would be startled, and of
those 25 1 would say that 75
per cent of them would be
nine and 10 semester students
who are working on their doc-
toral thesis.

, OWN LIBRARIES ~*

If he argues that most of
the students study ‘n_ their
apartments, then I would ask
him how many students are
able to buy their own libraries.

Many people at this Point
might fail to see the relation
between the preceding para.
graphs. Of all those who
should know the answer to
such a question, I would hope
that Dan Mombrea could an
swer it.

The fact is that he cant or
has not demonstrated his
ability to do so. Even if, one
takes up the solution to the
conflict depicted by these two
letters, just how does he speci.
fically define the conflict and
deal with it.

WELL-ROUNDED

Let me make one point cer.
tain. The solution does not lie
in “the well roundedness
theory” of past Davidson tra
ditions. But it also cannot be
found in the idealistic intel.
lectualism that, according to
Mr. Eleazer, pervades the
contemporary academic scene
in Marburg.

At his trial Socrates was
asked to choose between
Athens and the search for
truth. In an analogous way,
cue might ask the two extrem.
ists above to choose between
Davidson and the search for.
truth. Mr. Kendrick would
certainly choose Davidsca. Mr.
Eleazer would choose his new-
ly found truth, but not the
search of it.

On Concern and Responsibility

AT VARIOUS TIMES I have held forth at length
upon the subject of apathy among today’s students. |
have spoken from my experience at Davidson to try to
dispel the idea that there is true apathy among our stu-
dent body.

Now, when I am almost out of school I find my
attitude regressing, and I have begun to wonder if | -
haven’t been under certain delusions as to the merit of
our student body in this area. There are-times when I.
am encouraged by interest shown, but there are also
many times when I have felt that nothing in the world
could stir anyone from his personal niche into some
kind of action. |

I think it important to emphasize that activist pro-
cedures for their own sake do not.serve as any answer.
I do not feel that one must parade down main street .
Davidson, blocking the two or three cars, to prove the
need for a by-pass. Nor do I approve of activist measures
which may tend to bring personal insult or injury to
someone (the case with effigy burnings). Such things
are as little a part of an attempt to do something con-
structive as are Davidson's “friendly” jibes and hisses
in Chapel and other meetings.

I THINK IT IS TIME that someone stated that there
are some things that just “aren’t done” by people old
enough to be in college. College doesn’t give one a
license to be rude. There isn’t a man here who doesn’t
know the rules of common courtesy. For this reason
there is simply no excuse for not observing them no
matter how bad the speaker, program, or entertainment
may be. -

It is just that simple; there is nothing “sharp” about
making anyone feel uncomfortable, and anyone who
Says differently is way out of line. If you have a com-
plaint, either keep it to yourself or make it through the
proper channels; [ have never seen a time when it was
the right thing to do to interfere with the person(s) com-
plained of while they are speaking before the student

ody.

But I wish to carry this thing of exemplifications of
apathy further. How many of us have stood by and
watched wanton destruction be carried out in the dormi-
tories or around campus by our fellow students? What
do we think about when we see people breaking out
windows on the hall or writing on the walls or destroy-
ing light bulbs?

THIS SORT OF THING is every bit as bad as going
out and stealing the article which one destroys. And we
stand around and watch these things happening, never
Saying a word for fear we will be frowned upon for be-
ing “zeroes.”

There are other areas in which the kind of apathy
I am dealing with shows itself. One of the most promi-
nent of these is in the classroom. How often do we sit
and listen to a professor or a fellow student espouse a
point of view with which we are in total disagreement
and never make any response, even when we actually
believe what was said was in error?

Aren’t we too easy on other people? Don’t we just
go along with our own little cares and ideas and in our
silence give tacit approval to whatever passes through
our sphere of existence?

IN SHORT, the antidote to apathy is constructive
concern. If we believe in something we are obligated to
make it known to others when we feel they are stepping
out of line. This is a part of our social responsibility. At
Davidson we are in a community, and because of the
interest we are bound to have in the community from
our ties to it we are responsible as individuals to try to
do everything we can to make this an improved place
to get an education.

Thus are we responsible to the institution and the
community in which we live. At the same time we are
responsible to ourselves. Only by standing up for what
we believe can we retain any degree of the integrity and
self respect implied in the kinds of standards and goals
by which most of us must direct ourselves.

This problem is one which demands solution; it is
one which each one of us ean solve personally; no “book-
burning,” witch-hunt, or demonstration is required. All

.we have to do is look at ourselves and decide that we

are ready

to accept the re ibi
maturity. ep sponsibility demanded by our
