Student orientation for
the Board of Trustees

The candidacy of graduating senior and former SGA. President
Blain Butner for a position on the Board of Trustees ig cause to
reexamine the composition of the present Davidson College
Board.

At present. various members of the trustees are elected by the
supporting presbyteries, the Alumni Association, and the trustees
themselves. The composition of the board reflects the interests of
these groups.

Unfortunately, there is no provision for student membership on
the board.

The individual members of the present board have directed
many of their talents toward Davidson. Virtually all are leaders in
business, education, church or community. However. we remain
uneasy at the minimal contact the majority of the trustees have
with the campus community.

_ The most recent graduate of Davidson serving on the board was
last a student here over 15 years ago. No member of the board has
witnessed as a student the very fundamental changes in
academics. athlecics. and social life which have occured on cam-
pus in recent years. With the great majority of the information
communicated to the trustees coming from the administration, a
student perspective on life at Davidson and student evaluation of
the current programs can be all too easily overlooked.

Although the trustees have been for the most part fairly respon-
sive to students. we feel that communication there would be bet-
ter facilitated if there were a place on the Board of Trustees for
younger members who have very recently graduated from David-
son.

As Davidson continues to face major decisions in the areas of
campus planning. student life. and academic programming, the
Board of Trustees needs to be as fully informed as possible about
contemporary Davidson.

We believe that & graduating student would be an asset to the
Board of Trustees in dealing with these areas of concern in the
1970’s. We further believe that Blain Butner would serve the
Board with enthusiasm and dedication.

His tenure as Student Body President, his service on the Trustee
Governance Committee. his chairing of the Self-Study Committee
of Students and a variety of other activities certainly sub-
stantiates his interest in and his concern for Davidson. We believe
that the capable leadership he has exhibited as a student is in-
dicative of the service he would continue to provide as a trustee.

We wholeheartedly support his candidacy.

Pragmatism obstructs
y
vision for tomorrow

Pragmatism is the watchword of
today’s politicians. Even those who
detest Richard Nixon seem thoroughly
impressed with the virute of “being
realistic and practical”. —

This seems to me. to be another
situation where human beings do not ac-
curately rasp a process they appreciate
and wish to imitate.

The 1940’s and 1950’s abounded with
pragmatic leaders. Men like General
George Marshall and Sam Ravburn
were able to get things done. They
helped lead the country through very
trving tirftes.

In doing so they were admired by men
like Lyndon . Johnson and Richard
Nixon. But it is not true that Sam
Rayburn and Franklin Roosevelt were
born pragmatists. They were not always
More concerned with how vou get
something passed rather than what

ed.

A subtle change has come. Lyndon
Johnson made his reputation in the
United States Senate as a ‘‘can do”
leader. Richard Nixon seems to have
never developed a steady self image or
set of ideals.

Leadership became a rather narrow
enterprise with him. He was pragmatic
to the point of blindness.

Many politicians decrv the stvle of the
last years of leadership. But they main-
tain pride in their pragmatism. My fear
is that thev are too concerned with todav
to have vision for tomorrow.

They do not seem to sense that
pragmatism must be fueled and diree-
ted from the energy of idealism.

Todavs imitators of pragmatic
politics see the beauty and necessitv of
being realistic but thev have not har-
nessed this approach to the dreams that
stirred men like Ravburn. Jefferson.
and’Truman.

Our befuddlement over Vietnam
seems to demonstrate this. We sup-
ported and efficiently (U. S. stvle:
developed as army. to fight against
people who believed in what they were
fighting for.

The South Vietnamese were. fighting
against something and the Viet Cong for
something. Our present brand of
pragmatism does not have the flavor of
being for something.

Sam Ravburn’s pragmatism grew
from the life experience of a verv sen-
sitive idealistic person. It was a stvle
that was individual not imitative.
