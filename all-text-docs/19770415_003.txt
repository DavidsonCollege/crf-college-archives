Cartmill quells golf course rumors

By HAROLD HINTON
Staff Writer

Students and faculty mem-
bers who have been eagerly
awaiting the opportunity to
condemn the proposed golf
facility as an example of fiscal
irresponsibility may be disap-
pointed: the only outlay, the
seeding of a tee area, will
possibly total twenty dollars.

There are no plans at pre-
sent to spend any additional
funds, according to Athletic
Director Thomas A. Cartmill.
In recent weeks, rumors had
indicated that the athletic
department was preparing to
build a three, nine or eighteen-
hole gold course east of the
baseball diamond.

However, Cartmill said the
department was simply pre-
paring a fairway as a practice
area for the golf team and
physical education classes.
The athletic director outlined
the events which apparently
sparked the rumors:

New intramural fields are
being built now on the hill
directly north of the baseball
field. There will be four fields.
This action was initiated by
college officials months ago
because of the obvious lack of
intramural facilities and be-
cause of the need for field
hockey and club sport areas.

After dirt had been hauled
in for the new fields, there was
some excess fillage. ‘Because
there are no practice facilities
for the golf team except for
congested IMAC fields, the
athletic department decided
that the excess dirt could be
used to create a fairway.

The dirt was moved to the
west end of the two IMAC
fields beside the cemetary. A
hedge between the two fields

was removed. After the seed-
ing process has been com-
pleted, there will be a fairway
and tee.

Cartmill noted that those
two EMAC fields were the
smallest on campus and that
the four new fields will allevi-
ate any pressure caused by the
creation of the fairway.

Moving the excess dirt did
cost $2,000. Nevertheless, it
was necessary to move the dirt

somewhere so work on the new
fields could progress; and it
would have probably cost at
least $2,000 to put the dirt
anywhere.

Cartmill said there are no
plans to seek funds for a green
on the fairway in the im-
mediate future.

All departments have sub-
mitted plans for improvement

and expansion for the coming
decades. o

Eventually, the athletic
department does hope to have
a multi-hele golf course, com-
plete with greens, but that is a
goal for the very distant
future. .

Upon completion of the new
IMAC fields, Cartmill proudly
noted that the baseball dia-
mond, the fairway, and the
new fields would be in close
proximity to each other with a
central parking lot.

systems and help alleviate
some of the problems with
self-selection. It would be
more fair to the nationals
while removing some pressure
from those involved in self-sel-
ection.”’

Anders, in an earlier inter-
view, argued for the increased
autonomy of each national and
the right of each house to
handle their own affairs.

Russ Martin, Secretary of
Emanon, pointed out at the
meeting that ‘‘the non-frater-
nity houses would be at a dis-
advantage.’ He argued that
those freshmen who entered
the bid system would have
access to the whole court while
the independents would have

the option of only self-selec-
tion.

Ed Crosland, representing
Fannie and Mabel’s, said that
the Anders proposal would not
change the abuses of the
present system in. that it
would stimulate an early fall
rush.

The Fiji's and SPE’s, two
fraternities who moved off-
campus in the early "70’s in
order to preserve their inde-
pendence, expressed varying
positions.

The Fiji’s said they could
not support the proposal with-
out a guarantee of regaining a
house on the Court in the near
future. This would alleviate a

financial and potential rush
problem for the Phi Gamms.
Sig Ep President Stacey
Johnson issued the following
statement: ‘Since Sigma Phi
Epsilon is not a voting mem-
ber of PCC and since the
proposal being considered
does not directly affect off-
campus fraternities it would
be counter-productive for us to
come out either for or against
it. However, we have consis-

’ tently maintained that nation-

al fraternities have a right to
regulate their own affairs. Our
move off campus served to
protect that right. Therefore,
we lend our moral support to
the on-campus fraternities in
whatever measures they feel

necessary to preserve their

rights.”

Proposals passed by the
PCC will then be recommen-
ded to the Sub-Committee of
the Council on Campus and
Religious Life. Kathryn Brid-
ges, President of PCC said
that it is likely that all these
proposals will eventually end
up before that sub-committee.

‘We're going to go through
it all and vote on it Sunday,”
said Bridges in conclusion.

The matters of procedure
voted on by the Council were
that the President was to vote
only in the case of a tie, and
Rusk House was given the
right to vote since it conducts
regular meetings and holds
social functions on the Court.

‘‘T just don’t want another SIR
form where the students fill it out and
don’t get anything in return. My
concern and my commitment is that
the students get a voice,’’ Young
said.

Spencer stated that the two-parts
plan is ‘‘possible’”’, but that it is only
one of many alternatives.

Spencer-sees this statistical form
issue as only one of the faculty eval-
uation difficulties which must be

worked out when Dr. Zimmerman,
the new Academic Vice-President,
arrives next summer.

Zimmerman will be confronted with
the responsibility of drafting a ‘‘Code
of Faculty Evaluation Procedures” to
fulfill the directives of the 1976
College Constitution.

Although the Constitution only
specifically states that the ‘‘President
or his delegate’’ should work in
conjunction with the faculty to draft

SGA course
evaluation
informs students

The SGA Committee on Student
Course Evaluations announced yes-
terday that the winter term statistics
have been tabulated and will be ready
for distribution at the end of this
week.

Although actually 62 fewer forms
were turned in for winter. evaluation
than for fall, the committee considers
both returns as being approximately
equivalent.

Ralph Yielding, who supervised the
assimilation of winter term results,
said, ‘‘I had hoped for a much larger
return. But the fact that we didn’t get
it doesn’t mean the results are
inaccurate.”’

The winter statistics will actually
be more accurate than those in the
fall, according to committee advisor
Dana English.

‘‘We were much more careful in
going back over the last computer
printout to check for errors,’’ she
said.

The winter results did meet the
SGA’s two statistical requirements of
at least a 25 percent overall return
and three forms filled out for each

course to be included in the printed
pamphlet.

The new statistics will be rounded
off to the nearest decimal in another
SGA attempt to achieve greater
accuracy. The fall results were roun-'
ded to the nearest whole number.

The SGA plans to publish both the
fall and winter results in an evalua-
tion handbook, together with subjec-
tive evaluations by area majors.

Each professor will be given the
opportunity to unite his own concept
of the courses he teaches.

The handbook, edited by Jim
Clark, will be published over the

-summer and will be ready for distri-

bution to students next fall.

The SGA originally wanted to mail
each incoming freshman a copy
during the summer to help in their
course selection, but postage costs
proved prohibitive.

Similar handbooks came out in the
fall of 1970 and 1973. No statistical
information was published last year
due to a mix-up with the computer
office.

According to English, the commit-
tee thought that the evaluation
handbooks were very valuable to
students and decided to put out a new
version. ‘‘We’d like to see a handbook
come out every year,” she said.

English said that the short range
goal of the committee is to ‘‘provide
information to students to aid in the
selection of courses. In no way are we
trying to evaluate professors for such
things as pay raises and tenures.”’

SGA President Thom Young said,
‘‘Within the limited scope of the
committee, its members are accom-
plishing everything they’ve set out to
do. I think the committee is doing one
hell of a job right now.”
