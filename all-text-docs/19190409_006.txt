Dr. Clayberg Delivers
Instructive Address

The Talk Greatly Enjoyed by Aescu-
lapian Club.

On last Thursday night the Aescula-
pian Club had the pleasure of hearing
an address from Dr, Harold D. Clay-
berg. The subject of Dr. Clayberg’s ex-
position was that of Heredity and Ge-
netics. He began by differentiating be-
tween the soma and the germ-plasm and
reminding the club of the well-known
principle of the continuity of the afore-
said germ-plasm, From this he drew the
deduction that every one of us has a bit
of old Adam in him, He then went on
to explain the metamorphosis of the ova,
bringing out the maturation of the zy-
gote, cell mitdsis, and the fertilization
of the zygote by the spermatozoa. He
told of the division of the chromatin in
the nucleus and stated that scientists
have shown these chromatic reds to be
the seat of all our inherited characteris-
tics. His talk was concluded by a short
elaboration of the: Mendelian laws and
the dominant and recessive genes. A
concrete illustration of these laws shows
that twenty-five per cent of the daugh-
ters of a bald-headed man will be bald-
headed also.

The club enjoyed the lecture very
much and all got a much clearer concep-
tion of the need for eugenics.

two main objects in view. First of all,
it tries to bring to every student the
knowledge of the living Christ, and to
imbue him with the ideals of this Christ.
Second, the Y. M. C, A. offers an op-
portunity to every one to serve. What-
ever may be your sphere of ability—so-
cial, literary,.or musical, the Y. M. C.
A. offers you a chance to develop it.
Which, would give’ you more pleasure,
the honor roll -or leading someone to
Christ? the debating team, or being the
successful leader of an) earnest Bible
class? winning a “D," or making the
mill children happy? Of course the
honor roll and the debating team and
making the “D" are part of a normal
Christian's life. But put first things
first. “Seck ye first the kingdom of
God and His righteousness, and all
these things will be added unto you.”

COOTIE DIRGE,

They Go Wild, Simply Wild
Over Me).

They go wild, simply wild over me,

Every nite how they crawl all over me,

They're thin and gray and flat,

And no matter where I’m at,

The small ones, the tall ones,

They crawl right up my back.

And the seams of my shirt seems to be

Just the place where they like the best

to be.

Every nite they come to dine,

In an undershirt of mine.

They go wild, simply wild, over me.
