One Was The

Loneliest Number

It may seem to the casual obser-
ver that all the king’s horses and all
the king’s men couldnt put the
Machi House back together again. It
may scem that way, bul the truth is
that all those horses and men were.
not trying to help the Machi House.

Unfortunate indeed is the truth
that no powers rushed to the aid of
the local fraternity group that, tried
to replace the Sigma Chi fraternity
here. Instead the group faltered and
then fell as the national fraternity
was reinstated in its former house.

The point that seems to have been
missed by all parties in the dispute
is that 12 is not a magic number.
There is no reason in the universe
that there should be 12 and only 12

social organizations on the campus. .

The fact is that the people who
tried tq, form a local fraternity could
still make that effort. They could be
joined by others with the same as-
pirations.-.And if such a coalitions
could be formed it would be impera-
tive that it have official college sup-
port— - ———— ;

It is generally agreed that Davidson
needs: groups to organize social life.
At present there are only twelve
such groups (neglecting the Union
which at best is poorly run as an
only nominal alternative to the sys-
tem). These twelve groups, however,
cannot in our opinion be the best
solution to the problem because they |
are based on anachronisms, and an
atavistic exclusionism that should
have. no place at Davidson.

Power And

Dean Rusk’s 1962 visit to Davidson
was hailed in THE DAVIDSONIAN
as one of Davidson's finest hours. In
1970. however. we cannot in good
conscience make the same claim,

There is no doubt that Rusk is a
visitor whose presence can distinguish
any campus. Even so we have to
agree with the students, and there
are many of them, who expressed real
disappointment at what Rusk had to
say. ,

It may be that Rusk’s cautious non-
committal was a result of his years
in positions of great power: It may
be that he is only another victim of
the ‘‘say-nothing” syndrome which
afflicts so many Davidson speakers.

Whatever His motivation Rusk did
make at least one statement« with
which we disagree heartily. Tuesday
night Rusk quoted Lord Acton as hav-
ing said, “Power corrupts and abso-
lute power corrupts absolutely.” Rusk
said that he did not think that the
United States of America had been
corrupted by its position of. power.
—It is frightening to think. that a
man «who has wielded-as much power
as Rusk has could make such a state-
ment. In his lecture Rusk purported
to be speaking to students in an effort
to bridge the age gap between ‘those
students and himself. Yet he missed

~The Silence-Con spirac’

Perhaps the greatest’ injustice in
the recent faculty- dismissal of the
RHC 24-hour open dorms proposal
_Wwas the way students were treated in
the maneuverings.

First it is a fact that although the
faculty meeting was called the Thurs-
day before. no students were inform-
ed of the upcoming consideration.
The three students who were to pre-
sent the proposal.to the faculty found
out about the meeting quite by acci-
dent on the day it was to take place.
One of the students overheard a mem-
ber of the} administration mention
the mecting. and another was noti-
fied only five minutes before he was
to begin ROTC drill.

Is this any way to treat the stu--
dents? a

Second the faculty acted only to
defeat (crush) the plan without lea’v-
ing any recourse to the students. The
vote was taken, but no official recom-
mendations or suggestions were giv-
en to the RHC as to what they might
do fhext. Such hints would have been
invaluable to the students since there
is--no official course of action left
open to ther in the present system.

Is this any way to treat the stu-
dents? .

Third, it seems from unofficial re-
ports leaking from the faculty mem-
bers toj/the students that much of
the debate in the meeting concerned
issues on which students could have

Unfortunately these twelve frater-
nities are maintained by the college
in that they and only they have ac-
cess to ihe “goods,” i.e. the houses.

Such a situation should not be al-
lowed to continue.

It is time the college and the ad-
ministration made the open pledge
of significant assistance for groups
which might provide alternatives to
the present national fraternities.

The organization for such groups
could very-well arise from the RIIC.
At Wakt. Forest for instance, the
Men's Residence Council has initiated
and maintained a highly successful
alternative to fraternities in its non-
exclusive “house” system. he RHC
could do the same here.

We should not look to the Union
for leadership. Its ultimate organiza:
tion is not under student control and
such control is fundamental to meet-
ing student needs. The Union has ex-
isted for decades and still students
complain about it. It is obviously too
stodgy to cope with the situation.

"T——The RHG on the other hand has

not yet begun to test the limits of its
powers. It seems cntirely feasable
for that group to be able to organize
a new system right down to the last:
cocktail hour or beach. trip.

Still the vital issue is official. sup-
port. Without giving that support the
college is merely endorsing the pre-
sent system. Giving that support
might be the first step toward re-

‘viving that rare -bread, the salisfied

Davidson stuclent.

The Nation

one of the major concerns of ‘ihose
very students.

” We look at the colossal shame of
involvement in Vietnam and. there -
is just no way that we cannot say
that_power has corrupted the U. S.
of A.

We can look at uncalled-for mili-
taristic bullying in the Bay of Pigs
and in the Dominican Republic. and
there is no way to deny the arrogance
of power. :

We can turn inward to strife that
has—erupted- because -the -people of-
this nation, orat least too many of
them. have been denied their hasic
civil and hysical rights, and it be
comes very hard lo say that power
has not corrupted something of the
national character.

N6, .we_do_not_agree with Rusk’s—

assessment of the effect of power on
the U.S. We cannot hold his cautious
view of the forces that we are involy-
ed with today. We cannot join_Rusk
in his seal on the top of an exceed-
ingly established and comfortable
fence. .

~Rather -we wauld hope to come
down off that fence and meet our
problems with a conviction and in-
novation too long absent from the
U. S. of A.-

shed invaluable light. :

The problem in this case is that
there is a great conspiraey .of silence
surrounding faculty deliberation. Stu-
dents with presentations for the facul-
ty may only stay until debate by the
faculty begins. They may not respond
to issues raised in that dehate:

Further the faculty constitution
does not permit members to freely
discuss. the meetings once they have
ended. and interested students must
glean their information as ‘they can
-from. unofficial and off-the-record.
sources. ‘

Is this any way to treat the stu-

dents?
_.We think not. It is extremely un-
fortunate that the proposal was de-
feated in such. a high-handed man
ner. We hope that the RHC may find
ways to continue their efforts in spite
of the faculty's move.

It is also our hope that the faculty
will see fit to begin: to move in the
direction of greater student partici-
pation in faculty decisions. Not only
would student testimony be valuable
to the faculty, but such participation
might help erase current ‘bad feelings
between the students and faculty.

Opening faculty meetings to stu-
dents would be a bold step for a

By PAUL E. ROWLAND

Those Upstanding Davidson Men

An eminent authority on almost everything re-
ceived riotous applause from the 1200 Davidson stu-
dents filling Loathe Auditorium the other night when
he announced, “I hate bigots.”

The eminent authority delivered an eloquent ad-
dress to the students defending his assertion “al-
most everything is inevitable despite anyone's willing-
ness. to contemplate whatever is happening.”

“There are no absolutes,” declared the tall beard-
ed gentleman. When a few students snickered at his
espousal of situational ethics, he made a derogatory
gesture with his left hand and continued his address.

Despite the pessimistic outlook and his status as
the greatest living authority on the subject, the short.
black man spoke out strongly against suicide calling
for legislation which would make stiffer the penalties
for attenypted suicide. He suggested a mandatory
death sentence. ,

With respect to outside instigators of campus.
agitation and other troublemakers, the young. long-
haired speaker counseled. “don't take amy advice.”

The aging gentleman then ended his talk. with a
lecturn-pounding shouting calt-for a return to reason.

Following the politely responsive applause a few
students sitting-in the front of the auditorium jump-
ed up in their anxiety to return to their studies.

Those who had dozed during the address weré
apparently awakened by the ruckus and joined ifi the
Standing applause wondering what they had missed.
_ Soon the -entire audience was giving the grin-
ning speaker a standing ovation, with the exception
of some faculty members whose fect had gone to
steep. Following the speech, students were allowed
questions from the floor.

When one smartaleck accused the speaker of
“gross. generalizations’ he was told. “Nonsense! 12
qualify everything I say.”

_ When the chainsmoking spzaker was asked. about
the evidence that cancer and: cigarette smoking are:
related, he dismissed the notion adding that “nine
out of ten statistics are very_misleading.” - _

Turning to national’ matters. students asked
about the Senate’s haggling over the Carswéll nomi-
nation. Calling the Senate “unqualified to judge the
man,” ‘the speaker observed “The Republicans let
Nixon choose Agnew, didn't they? Just think what
another choice like that could do for the Supreme
Court!” .

In a special interview laier the speaker confided
that he would have preferred Julius Hoffman to, Cars-
well but that both are equally qualified.

; The father of five is no mean figure himself
“having recently been appointed to head the adminis
tration’s stully of population control. .

Commenting on cultural trends, the. speaker not-
ed that, “from the theater of the absurd to non-novels -
to plo:less cinema etc., it is only logical that we pro-
ceed to absurd public speaking.”

* _ Apparentiy unwilling to tackle any -more yues-
lions, the speaker offered one last thought:

tency is the hobgoblin of little minds.’ ”
