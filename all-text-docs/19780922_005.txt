IV. NEW APPOINTMENTS

Basic responsibility for the
determination of staffing needs
and for initiating new faculty
appointments rests with the
President. Normally the Presi-
dent will delegate responsibility
for the actual conduct of the
search and recruitment process
to the VPAA, who will in turn
work with the appropriate de-
partment chairman. In addition
to listing the nature of the.
position, the anticipated rank,
the experience and fields desi-
red, notices of an intended
appointment sent to professio-
nal journals, associations, etc.,
will contain a standard descrip-
tion of Davidson’s nature as a
church-related college.

The VPAA may, and ordi-
narily will, delegate the initial
screening of applicants to the

work of the College through
stimulating teaching, intellec-
tual leadership, and fruitful
personal relationships with stu-
dents and colleagues.

Candidates may be invited
during their visit to the campus

‘to make a public presentation in

their field or to teach a class.
However, too much must not
rest on a single performance. In
the case of candidates without
prior teaching experience, gene-
ral promise, and in the case of
experienced .teacher, long-term
performance in prior positions

‘must be the principal basis for

judgement.

After the chairman has solici-
ted the opinion of members of
the department and received the

opinion of other interested fa--- -

culty members, he will discuss
the candidates with the VPAA.
The VPAA. will communicate
b’s judgements, along with the
supporting information,

as many potential candidates as
possible at an appropriate pro-
fessional meeting or other occa-
sion. He will then review with
the VPAA the dozen or so most
promising candidates with a
view to choosing the most likely
ones for campus interviews: The. —
VPAA will invite the leading
candidate or candidates to the
College for a visit.

Along with an invitation,
candidates for a position will
receive a copy of the college’s
Statement of Purpose. During

The chairman may be asked
to meet with the President and
the VPAA before the President .
reaches his decision. Letters of
appointment will emanate from
the President’s Office. The let-
ter of appointment will set

‘forth the terms and conditions —

with the College Constitution,
Article IV, Section 5, of the
Trustee By-Laws, and this code

res.

ordinarily arrange to attend one
or more of the instructor’s
classes. As much as for evalua-.
tion, the purpose of these visits
is to help the instructor with the
process of adjustment to Da-
vidson and to assist in the
attainment of his or her maxi-
mum potential as a teacher. The
department chairman may
likewise visit the new appoin-
tee’s classes for the same pur-
pose.

During the fall term of the
second year the VPAA will
meet with the department
chairman to discuss the perfor-
mance of the instructor. Letters
will be solicited.by the VPAA
from colleagues who have come
to know the new member
through such means as commit-
tee assignments, and from
members of the staff of courses
and programs in which the
instructor has participated.

such material as he or she
believes will be helpful to a
consideration of his or her
performance. After studying
this evidence and conducting
further interviews if deemed
necessary, the VPAA will re-
view the instructor’s perfor-
mance with the President.

By December 15 of the second
year the instructor will. receive
from the President a letter
either renewing the contract or
communicating a decision not
to renew it:

The criteria for evaluation
shall be those described in
Section II. In applying them
the President and the VPAA
will normally be looking for
evidence of recent and potential
growth in teaching ability, par-
ticularly in the case of instruc-

tors who are just beginning»

their teaching careers and’ who
lack teaching experience.

In making their decision, the
President and the VPAA will
weigh the prospects for growth

against the greater mobility ,

which faculty members enjoy in
their early years of teaching,
keeping in mind the fact that
where prospects for tenure are
slim, an early seperation may
be more to an instructor's
advantege than renewal of con-
tract.

President's decision, the VPAA

tor to discuss, insofar as confi-

such decisions will be conducted
during winter term.

Visiting appointments, one-
year terminal appointments, or
part-time appointments are not
considered probationary and do
not require notification of ter-
mination. In the case of such
appointments, a review would
be conducted only at the Presi-
dent’s disrretion.
VIE:-FACULTY MEMBERS
ON SUBSEQUENT TERM

APPOINTMENTS

As with members of the
faculty in their first contract
period, review will take place in
the fall of the second year of the
contract, and by December 15th
the instructor will either be
informed _of the termination of
his or her contract, or offered a
renewal.

As stipulated by the College
Constitution, in the event of
termination at this point, the
instructor will be entitled to a
terminal year. In reaching their
decision the President and the
VPAA will pay particular’ at-
tention to evidence of growth
since the last review. Normally,

— with each successive review_the__"
expectation regarding perfor-
mance will be increased, as the
instructor gains experience as a
teacher and scholar.

VII: THE TENURE
DECISION

The decision to grant conti-
nuous tenure must be made
only after a searching examina-

_ tion and with the greatest care,
since usually it will represent a
lifetime commitment. Continu-
ous tenure entails not only an
increased responsibility of the
institution to the faculty mem-
ber, but an increased responsi-
bility of the faculty member
toward the institution and its
long-term welfare.

At the point of the tenure
decision, the evidence gathered
should demonstrate convincing-
ly that the candidate holds
promise of making a continued
contribution of the highest qua-
lity to the intellectual and moral
life of the institution. If at this
‘point any serious doubts remain
regarding the prospects for
long-term high performance,
the institution, in order to carry
out its responsibility to its
students, must render a nega-
tive decision.

_ Preliminary to the tenure
decision there Will be a review of
the faculty member’s whole
career at the College. As stated
in Article X of the College
Constitution, conferral of ten-
ure by the Trustees requires not
only evidence of demonstrated
‘professional competence but of
service to the academic commu-

nity and commitment to the
welfare of the College.

The tenure evaluation will be
made during the sixth year of
full-time ‘teaching at the Col-—
lege. Credit of up to three years
will be given for full-time teach-
ing at the assistant professor
level or ‘higher at an accredited
four-year institution.

The review preceding the
tenure decision is normally con-
ducted by the VPAA on behalf
ofthe President. It begins with
an interview between the candi-
date and the VPAA during
which the latter further explains
the process, including the sche-
dule to be followed.

Either at this point or subse-
quently the candidate will sub-
mit and updated curriculum
vitae and all such materials as .
may be deemed helpful to a
favorable consideration. The

.VPAA will usually arrange

interviews between the candi-
date and the Education Com-
mittee of the Board of Trustees.

He will also request of the
candidate’s department chair-
man a full written evaluation
according to the criteria set
forth in Section II.

In preparing his report the
chairman will consider all rele-
vant evidence, including course
syllabi, tests, grades awarded,
research in progress, publica-
tions, professional meetings at-
tended, papers presented, co-
operation in the development of
library holdings, the records of
former students and the contri-
butions the candidate has made
to their development.

In addition to requesting a
report from the chairman, the
VPAA will request written,
~~~evaluations from members of
the candidate’s department and
may also request evaluations
from members of the candi-
date’s division, or other depart-
ments and divisions. He will
review student evaluations,
with particular attention to
long-term trends.

At his discretion the VPAA
may, in addition to letters,
request interviews-with persons _
who, in his estimation, are in a
position to contribute to the
evaluation process.

The information and judge-
ments resulting from all of the
foregoing procedures will be
shared with the President,
whose recommendation will be
communicated to the Trustees.
The candidate will be informed
of the Trustees’ decision prior to
September 1st. In accordance
with their decision the ensuing
academic year will constitute
either the first year of continu-
ous tenure or else a terminal
year.

- IX:EVALUATION OF
TENURED MEMBERS OF
THE FACULTY

The standards for evaluation
of tenured members of the
faculty will be the same as those
used in making the tenure
decision itself, namely, evidence
of continued superior teaching
performance and of sustained
personal impact on the life of
