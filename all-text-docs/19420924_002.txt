To The Freshmen

We of the DAVIDSONIAN staff

would like to follow everyone else with
a belated greeting to the class of 1946,
You have been processed by orienta-
tion, thoroughly lubricated by the sooth-
ing oils of Rush Week, and now you
consider yourselves ready to embark on
your career at Davidson.

If you concur with the pattern laid

out by the classes of 105 other years,
however, you will find the rosy schedule
ofthe past two weeks to be a dangerous
illusion. Many social-minded young-
sters attempt to stretch these weeks in-
to a four year party, but few of them
remain to see the warm spring: sunlight
streaming through the April leaves.

In short, it’s been-fun,-but-tt is cer-
tainly not the routine. Taking its place,
though, are many items which, along
with those interruptions designated in
the catalogue as classes, are aggregated
under the term “college life.” These ac-
tivities furnish a valuabl part of the
type of education for which Davidson
College has become famous. This pro-
vided, as we have hinted, the all-impor-
tant books are not neglected.

at Davidson. Let us make a few sug-
gestions as to the selection of your chan-
nels of collegiate expression.

First, examine your interests. You
should know whether you would like to
concentrate publications, _or
YMCA work, or on athletics. Keep
your schedule: well-rounded, but don’t
scatter your interests indiscriminately.

on on

Remember that although publications
take time_all four years, and that if you
plan to try out for them you should ap-
ply. immediately, such organizaations
as the various honorary fraternities are
open principally to the Junior and
Senior Classes, All of these_groups
offer valuable training in almost every
field.

A second general suggestion is to
talk to the person in charge of. the
activity in which you feel. particularly
interested and determine whether you

can really find time for it and if it off-
ers the kind of outlet you expected.
Do not by all means be “high pressured”’
into spending a lot of valuable time
doing someone else’s job. ;

Third, if you find yourself involved
too deeply in too many activities don’t
hesitate to drop the least valuable. The
adage that whatever is worth doing is
worth doing right is as true here as
anywhere.

‘Fo The Upper Classes

We of the present student generation
of Davidson College, of the. upper
classes, that is, are faced with a responsi-
hilitv, the scope.of which, we fear, few
suspect.

It has become our lot to set the ex-
ample and in large measure to furnish
the training of Davidson’s largest Fresh-
mat Class... In the past years this has
been left largely to orientation, to the
Court of Control, and to the written
and unwritten traditions of the college.
This, however, can no longer be.

The present first year group enjoys
little prospect of four full years of Dav-
idson’s quiet but engulfing influence.
The presence of gas rationing and short-
age of tires, as well as the crowded con-
dition of the-regular- instruments of
transportation willawithout doubt curtail
the week-end traveling which has char-
acterized Davidson since the ““T” model
lord first appeared.

Consequently, we will see a lot more

there will crop up in the student body
Petty dissensions and bad feelings which
could wreck that Davidson spirit of
which we are proud,

be one of two results.

Actually, we have no teal fear of the
latter taking place. However, we should
like +6 charge every student at Davidson
to make it his personal responsibility
to see that the crisis outside, instead of
tearing. our relations among ourselves
down in any respect, will draw us more
closely together in the bonds of a better
Davidson.

We would like to suggest as a project
for the Sophomore closs that they take
it upon themselves to_aet as leaders in

just such a movement. ‘There is no

reason that, instead of the uncertain, —

mangled school year that many pre
dicted, Davidson's 106th year should

A tradition such as the Wildcat

for the duration of your college
career, This year I advocate a
rejuvenation of this Spirit for every
student, regardless of class. Pep
