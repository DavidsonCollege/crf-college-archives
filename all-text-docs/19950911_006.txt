Week in Washington
Packwood resigns from Senate

By Davip SANTSCHI
Washington correspondent

In an emotional speech to the
Senate last Thursday, Senator Bob
Packwood (R-OR), 62, announced
that he would resign from office
rather than face expulsion proceed-
ings for sexual misconduct and
obstruction of justice. The charges
stem from a three-year investiga-
tion by the Senate Ethics Commit-
tee, which last Wednesday voted
6-0 to recommend Packwood’s
expulsion from the Senate. He is
only the second senator since the
Civil War to resign his office fac-
ing expulsion.

The Ethics Committee inves-
tigation began in 1992 when 17
women formerly employed by
Packwood alleged that he made
unwanted sexual advances toward
them. The harassment, which oc-
curred from 1969 to 1990, included
fondling, “aggressive, blatantly
sexual advances,” and “physical
coercion,” according to Mitch
McConnell (R-KY), who serves
on the committee. Packwood’s
diaries, included in the committee’s
10,145 page compilation of evi-
dence against him, reveal lurid,
sexual details of a man obsessed
with the women he employed. He
praises one woman for “brighteyes
and hair and that ability to shift her
hips.” He recalls drinking wine
until he blacked out and boasts that
he “made love to” 22 women.

The committee also learned
that Packwood and Senator Phil
Gramm (R-TX), now a presiden-
tial candidate, tried to avoid cam-
paign finance laws to funnel money
to Packwood’s 1992 re-election
campaign. Packwood was also

accused of obstructing justice by
altering and deleting diary entries
before he turned them over to the
committee.

At first, the Senate voted
against holding public hearings on
the matter. However, a month ago
Packwood demanded hearings.
After its investigation, the Ethics
Committee reported that Packwood
made “uninvited and unwelcome
sexual advances” on women, wors-
ened by his “significant problems”
with alcohol. The committee ac-
cused Packwood of using his posi-
tion “to obtain employment for his
estranged spouse in an attempt to
reduce any future alimony pay-
ments.” The committee found that
“Sen. Packwood purposefully se-
lected and changed entries in his
diary tapes . . . that could be in-
criminating to him.” It then rec-
ommended his expulsion.

After the unanimous vote for
expulsion, the toughest censure
possible, pressure mounted for
Packwood to resign and avoid
embarrassing hearings. It requires
a two-thirds vote of senators to
expel a member. But Packwood
defiantly attacked the ruling as “‘to-
tally and absolutely outrageous”
and accused the Ethics Committee
of defaming him for “stolen kisses.”

As late as noon Thursday,
Packwood told his staff that he
would fight the sexual harassment
charges. But after consulting with
several Republican senators who
urged him to resign, including
Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS),
Packwood realized that he would
only degrade the Senate further by
remaining. At 4:30 p.m. Thurs-
day, Packwood began a resigna-
tion speech to a somber Senate.

“It is my duty to resign,”
Packwood said in a tearful fare-
well to the institution in which he
served for 26 years. “It is the
honorable thing to do for the coun-
try, for this Senate.” He recalled
the major issues for which he
fought, including abortion rights
and the tax overhaul of 1986. Af-
terward, a few senators eulogized
Packwood’s career, some hugging
him and weeping openly.

Dole wanted Packwood to re-
main in the Senate for “some rea-
sonable time,” probably 60 days,
to ensure an orderly transition.
However, Democratic senators
were outraged that Packwood was
still managing bills on the floor
after his resignation. Packwood
agreed to leave the Senate by Oc-
tober 1.

Packwood’s resignation will
have significant consequences. As
chairman of the powerful Finance
Committee, his “unparalleled mas-
tery” of arcane tax codes and com-
plex Medicare, Medicaid, and wel-
fare legislation will be missed when
the Senate struggles with these is-
sues this fall. Packwood was also
the floor leader for the Republican
effort to overhaul welfare.

The responsibility for guiding
this legislation now falls to Dole,
who is both majority leader and a
presidential contender. William
Roth, Jr. (R-DE), not known for
his command of legislative detail,
will replace Packwood as chair of
the Finance Committee. A special
election in Oregon will determine
Packwood’s successor.

First hope for Bosnian peace

follows NATO intervention

It all started on the 28th of
August when Serbs sent mortar
shells crashing into the streets of a
market in Sarajevo. The result of
this action was that 43 people were
killed, 80 wounded; and with
graphic pictures of the carnage
flooding the media, American of-
ficials finally decided that they had
to act.
tions, NATO launched its largest
attack yet against the Serbs on
August 30.

At two in the morning (local
time), the first of many American
planes took off to join up with
European radar suppression and
attack planes. As the first NATO

~ bombs plummeted to their targets
early on that Wednesday morning,
the whole character of the war in
Bosnia changed. After several
years of threats and brief periods
of action, interspersed with extreme
embarrassment, a UN-backed
NATO finally took action and set

fourth to move their artillery out of
the mountains surrounding

agreed to move the guns, but have

From a military point of view,
the raids were “disappointing.”

Wendy’s manager
in hot water for
upbraiding workers

RICHMOND, VA — Three students have won the right to
wear braids to work at Wendy’s Old Fashioned Hamburgers
after a manager briefly banned the hairstyle as “prone to bugs
and lice.”

On their side, the students had the corporate logo, featur-
ing a red-haired girl with braids, and Virginia health regula-
tions, which recommend braids as a hair restraint for food
handlers.

The students, all black women, have shoulder-length
hair braided into more than 100 stiff strands in a style popular
among black youths. The three called the ban racist, kept
their hairdos and said they were willing to be dismissed.

The women said the manager of the store told them last
month that their hair was unsanitary, although they all wore
the required caps or visors.

“He said we were prone to bugs and lice because we don't
wash our hair,” said one of the young women, Nikitia Grant,
17, a freshman biology student at Virginia Commonwealth
University in Richmond. “It was so messed up, it was sad.”

The hairdos, which take about nine hours, cost about
$85, including two or three washings and a monthly scalp
cleaning. After two months, the hair must be rebraided.

Dr. Andrea J. Nicolls, a curator of African art at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, said the comments
by the manager, who is white, showed “ignorance of African
culture.” She said the style was meant to keep hair clean and
out of the way in a hot, dusty climate.

Another of the students, Aleeta Dunn, 17, a high school
senior and National Honor Society member, said: “There’s a
white girl who works here with hair all the way down her
back. But the manager said, ‘I know she washes it.’”

The president of the fanchise, which operates seven
Wendy’s restaurants in the Richmond area, reversed the
manager’s policy after an account of the dispute appeared
Thursday afternoon on the fron page of The Richmond Free
Press, ablack-oriented weekly. “We realized we had goofed
up,” said the president, Edward P. Anderson.

ing contributed to the less than 50
percent kill rate of the missions.
Many times a second and third
mission had to be flown to destroy
asingle target. There was also one
fighter shot down, a French Mi-
rage 2000. The pilots of this plane
are known to be alive, but there is
debate as to whether they are being
held captive or not.

While NATO’s generals may
be upset about the results of the
bombing, NATO statesmen are not.
The bombing received a quick and
sincere response from the Bosnian
Serbs who returned to the bargain-
ing table. The most encouraging
change in events occurred on Fri-
day when the two opposing sides
agreed to the terms of a prelimi-
nary peace arrangement. The deal
would not divide Bosnia
Herzegovina into two separate

countries, but would give the Serbs
and Muslim-Croat federation their
own territories inside the republic.
The agreement would cut the Serb
held territory from 70 percent of
Bosnia (which they currently con-
trol) to 49 percent. Even though
the Serbs would be loosing sub-
stantial territory, they would not
be giving up any land which they
consider vital and would be gain-
ing some important regions that
they had not been able to control
through military means.

The war is definitely not over.
NATO continues to bomb, and the
armies in Bosnia are still fighting.
But for the first time in the 41-
month-old war, there is hope of an
end and leaders around the world
are beginning to prepare for how
their countries will interact and
help a postwar Bosnia.
