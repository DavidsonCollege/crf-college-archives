Right On! Rocks On in 900 Room

Funky 70s band gives Class of 2001 something to shout about

By WESLEY GOLDSBERRY

It’s a ripening tradition at
Davidson College Orientation:
throw the impending year’s fresh-
man class into a big room with a
raucous musical group and see how
they all get along.

Another year ~later,'the trick
still works.

Put every prominent 1970s -

musical ensemble you can think of
into a large metzyhorical blender,
click on “puree,”’ and shazam, you
have Right On!, a colorful, charis-
matic nine-member cover band from,
New York City, who performed
Thursday night in the 900 Room.
The band played for over two
and a half hours amidst a stage
adorned with colorful moving lights
and asmoke machine, which supple-
mented the hazy atmosphere inevi-
tably created by the mass of sultry,
energetic teenagers facing the stage.
Many students helped supple-
ment the atmosphere by dressing in

whatever 70s garb they could scrape
together.

At least two aspiring Village
People impersonators were sighted
wearing the proverbial aviator

shades and. backwards plastic

firefighter helmets.

Before the first bass notes of
Stevie'Wonder’s “Superstition” had
shaken the floor, a myriad of for-

merly apprehensive first-year stu- °

dents sent their limbs flailing as
they let the funky vibes flow.
They exhibited a commendable
amount of cultural literacy with re-
gards to Right On!’s repertoire, as
nearly every female in the crowd
shouted effortlessly along with “I
Will Survive” word for word.
Most students were even able

to avoid mistaking Rick James’ °

“Superfreak” for Hammer’s “U
Can’t Touch This.”
The band, consisting of drums,.

‘keyboard, bass guitar, lead guitar,

tenor, and bass saxophones, and
several vocalists, was a very eclec-
tic, talented group of soulful indi-

viduals.
They had a man who could

sing like James Brown, and another .

who could scream like James
Brown.

The former fooled at least one
audience member by performing
the intro to “Sex Machine” only to
proceed into “I Feel Good,” which
was nonetheless oneof the evening’s
biggest hits.

Arrangements of hits by The
Jackson Five (with the lead singer
pulling off an outstanding Michael-
esque falsetto) and even Metallica
were also well performed and re-
ceived.

Although the temperature in
the 900 Room continued its rise
into sweltering proportions, a solid
contingent of both first-year and
older students continued to get down
with their bad selves. Right On!’s
improvised encore concluded after
160 copacetic minutes of funk,
R&B, and disco, managing to spare
us of any insipid rendition of
“YMCA.”

The band itself claims that they
may be returning to campus in the
spring or even sooner.

Davidson
managed to
put itself on
the band’s
“good list”
as Union
Board mem-
bers ‘helped
them dis-

mantle their

elaborate set

(an act of

magnanim-
ity » rarely
seen at other
colleges, ac-
cording to
one band
member).
Right
On! offered
a nostalgic
retreat from
the formali-

Gran Torino to drive home the
‘“‘Welcome Back’’ message

By WESLEY GOLDSBERRY

Perhaps Davidson’s biggest
concert event of the year will occur
Thursday evening at Richardson
Field.

Gran Torino, not to be con-
fused with the Ford automobile of
the same ‘name, will perform this
year’s “welcome back” concert at
8:00 p.m.

According to music critic Luke
Robinson, Gran Torino’s sound falls
under the “ebullient funk” category,
with their instrumentation includ-
ing guitars, drums, and a host of
brass.

Although occasionally the band
slips into a slow R&B mode, they
have a tendency to turn even their
most naturally inhibited spectators
into dancing fools. “If you like
‘Jungle Boogie,’ you’ll love Gran
Torino,” Robinson said.

Admission is free with your
ID, $7.00 without it.

The concert promises to be as a
massive event as last year’s corre-
sponding show —Jump, Little Chil-

ba — which appeared to draw a

ajority of the student body.

Gran Torino wails away at a South Carolina gig in November 1996. They
will play at Richardson Field Thursday night.
