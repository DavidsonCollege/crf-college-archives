Whereas, last week’s tragedies in
New York, Virginia, and Pennsylva-
nia sent Davidson College students,
faculty, and staff into shock, sadness,
and devastation;

Whereas, for a period of time, we, as
a campus, were not able to concen-
trate on anything but last week’s hor-
rific events;

Whereas, the administration made
a choice not to cancel classes and
relieve faculty and staff after the at-
tack of the World Trade Center, the
attack of the Pentagon, and the plane
crash in Pennsylvania;

Whereas, the students might dis-
agree with each other on what actions

our_government should take in re-
sponse to the attacks in New York,
Virginia, and Pennsylvania, but stand
united as acommunity on three strong
issues;

Therefore, let it be known that the
Student Government Association here
assembled on this day, the twentieth of

eptember in the year two thousand
and one, proclaims that this campus is
united through caring for each other
in these hard times, united in our
disagreement with the administration
in their reluctance to cancel classes
and relieve faculty and staff, and stands
united in our love for the United States
of America and other freedom-loving
countries of the world.
