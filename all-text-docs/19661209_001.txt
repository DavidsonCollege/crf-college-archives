hew Wheary of cumpus, one of
the question, Jeft unanswered
has been that of where to build
it, 1f ond when it is decided to
bulld one,

This thas been the object of
much discussion from the outset
of the new Hbrary idea. Recent-
ly it was the port of an evalua-
en by several oxperts an the
subject, who worked with the
college administration in ape
praising several proposed loca:
tons.

About a month ago the college
ealled upon Charles F. Gilletre,
landscape architect for the Da-
yidson campus, to evaluate ench

of the proposed sites. Gillette,
who wow yes in Richmond, Vi...
spent a day on campus talking
with President D, Grier Martin
and Director of the Library Chal-
mers G. Davidson. After dis-
cussing the feasibility of the
sevartal possible locations, Gil-
letie selected the area of the

present guest house and the
president's tome as the bese
site.

The college then invited Keyes

For Drinking Violations

Strict Enforcement —
Implied In Latitude Open House Opposition

Penalties for violaton of the drinking rule were
reduced by action al the regular faculty meeting

Tuesday.

The original rule. which read, “A student will

ordinarily be suspended .

.” for a drinking viola-

tion, was changed hy the faculty to. ‘A student will
be subject to disciptinary action up to and including
suspension if he is found gullly of violating any of
the following regulations . . .

The motion was introduced by Dr. Max Polley
and was carried without opposition or debate Tues-
day. The change poes into effect immediately.

According to Richard C. Burts, dean of students,
the rute will have the effect “of easing up the situa-
tion in that the executive committee will have avail-
able to it a wider range of penalties. and we think
and hope this will be an improvement in the situa-

tion.”

“We hope that the rule will be a meaningful
guide rather than a contest of what you can get by

with,” said Burts.

‘However, one faculty member said he thought
that stricter enforcement would produce a worse situ-

ation. “I mean,” he sald, “alll|

ing."
