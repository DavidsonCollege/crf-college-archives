APPRECIATION WEEK

THE DAVIDSONIAN

| As someone once wisely observed, it is during the spring

that the more sensible types of young men’s fancies lightly
(?) turn to thoughts of love. Unfortunately, such a plea-
|sant fate is not the lot of sports-writers, alleged or other-
wise. Regardless of past experiences March seems to
kindle in the breast of each the desire to go on record with
their predictions of the outcome of the year’s major league
pennant fights. Therefore, not wishing to be different,
(nor expecting to be right) here’s the way that we see
them in the American league.

The red hot three-way race for the junior loop flag
which failed to materialize in 1946 should occur this year.
|The Tigers and the Indians have done some swapping and
have brought the usual aspirants up from the minors in
an effort to increase their,chances of dethroning the de-
}fending champions. The final outcome may well be deter-
mined by the breaks that the three contenders get.
BOSTON TO WIN

The Boston Red Sox have done little to
change the makeup of the squad which breezed
to victory in the ’46 chase. Altho most of the
credit was given to a trio to capable chunkers,
Mickey Harris, Tex Hughson, and Dave “Bo”
Ferriss, the Beantowners batting punch actually
made the triumph possible. It is true that Mana-
ger Joe Cronin’s top hurlers won 68 games be-

tween them, but their earned run averages clear-
ly show that they weren’t as stingy with runs
as were quite a few of the other pitchers in the
circuit. However, again in ’47, the cream of the-
American League’s mound corps will not be able
to muffle the big bats of Williams, York, Pesky,

\ Di Maggio, and Company. With some assistance
| from their own hill staff the Bosox will be able
to return the bunting to its position atop spacious

Fenway Park when September rolls around.

What. effect.the loss of. dank-Greenberg.will have-on
\the Detroit Tigers will not be known until the curtain
| Soes down on the coming campaign. However, even with-
out the home-run hitting first sacker, the Bengals can
field a potent team, one which will push Boston all the
way to the wire. The Motor City nine’s trump card is its
pitching staff, led- by Hal Newhouser, (who is, in the
opinion of many, the outstanding twirler in the loop) ably
assisted by Paul ‘‘Dizzy’” Trout and Virgil “Fire” Trucks.
Only Roy Cullenbine and George Kell hit well last season
and unless Steve O’Neills’s men display more batting pow-
er they'll have to be content with the second slot. With the
present cast this added punch won't be forthcoming.

The Cleveland Indians should be firmly in-
stalled in third place when the season ends, Bill
Veeck, the Tribe’s new owner, isn’t the kind to be
satisfied with an also ran club and his efforts to
| build for the future will be apparent even in 1947.
| The Indians have in Manager Lou Boudreau
and Joe Gordon, the best double-play combine
in the business, and one of the better third sack-
ers in dependable Ken Keltner. If a capable
first baseman turns up the inner works will be
the envy of the league. Add to this the strong
arm of “Rapid Robert” Feller and look out for
trouble. The outfield, bolstered by the purchase
of Stan Spence, will furnish the needed batting
punch but Feller’s mound colleagues don’t have
the ability to bring home the bacon frequently
enough

The ’47 version Of the once mighty Bronx Bombers can
e summed up by a large question mark. With the veteran
3ucky Harris at the helni? the Yankees could win the pen-
ant if their big guns regain their old time form. A pre-
€dson operation will again handicap Joe DiMaggio and
Itho Keller and Henrich should show improvement the
est of the regulars don’t have it in thdm. Watch Bill
ohnson, the New Yorker’s hot corner man. He may well
evelop into one of the best in Yankee history.

NATS HEAD SECOND DIVISION

The Senator’s changes also rest on the abilities ot
everal old timers.to stage comebacks. If the ever-popular
ecil Travis hits his stride the Nats will have a crack in-
leld, offensively and defensively. The outfield cannot
leasure up to the inner works, however; nor can the hill
Orps compare with those of the other front running con-
enders. Veterans Buck Newson, Sid Hudson, and Early

ynn will win their share but their fellow hurlers will not

e able to carry the rest of the load successfully.
; The St. Louis Browns and the Chicago White Sox will
ight it out for sixth place with the latter club coming out
n top as the result of superior hitting. Muddy Ruel, the
rown’s new pilot, may, as the result of his years with the
ale Hose, be able to'upset the dope bucket, however.

The cellar slot as usual will be the sole property. of the
hiladelphia Athletics. Connie Mack has some capable per-
ormers in Sam Chapman, Phil Marchildon, Jesse Flores,
and Elmer Valo but the crafty “A” skipper just doesn’t
fae the talent to lift his club out of the league basement.

Delts Lead Cup Race

PhiGams Are Second

With the running of the interfraternity track meet two weeks

ago, the fight for the cup was suspended for a short’ period.

This

break seems to afford the best opportunity to take a quick glance
at the fraternity standings, and to attempt to explain Pete Whittle’s

method of scoring. Two events h
