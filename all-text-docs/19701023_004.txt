- A Challenge

With the profraternity rally on the football field
Saturday, protest suddenly became a highly respectable
Davidson institution. It became something to bring a
date to, something to which one could wear his frater-
nity pin. :

" Yet in spite of all the seriousness and respecta-
bility of the pregame rally, one could not help but get
the feeling that the marchers were all quite seriously
misguided. ‘ :

They were faced with a fact, a given, and incon-

trovertible change in the Davidson social system. Yet
their action seemed designed in complete disregard of
the finality of the trustees’ decision. :
It would seem wise of the present fraternity mem-
bers, if they are at all really concerned with Davidson’s
social system, to try to work within that trustee decis-
ion to insure that the transition is made as smoothly
and as equitably as possible.

As was pointed out by several trustees and mem-
»bers of the administration, after the changes were
made, the new system is a “challenge to the fraterni-
ties and all Davidsoh students to learn to develop and
think in terms of new social arrangements. ;

It is nonsense for a fraternity member to moan,
as some did, that the old + just will, not | be.a fra-

ternity anymore. =

To think that the social Conceptions of Davidson
students can only be expressed in such narrowly limit-
ed terms is frightening. Perhaps the trustee action
came too late for these men of concrete minds.

Yet for those who still can think in other than tra-
ditional terms and for those freshmen who will be
working entirely within the new system a big chal-
lenge lies ahead.

It is a challenge to realize that social systems
need not be the anachronistic, exclusive, mystic goodie
monopolies Davidson has seen in the past.

It is a challenge to read the trustee decisions with

open minds and to realize that the petty objections

of coercion and college control are really avoiding the
issues entirely.

It is a challenge to the fraternities to forget their °

pasts and to look to their futures.

A Real ‘Big Weekend’

Davidson. students have never been known as
ones with the capacity to avoid bandwagons and we
fear that the*Ad Hoc Committee to End Big Week-
ends may ‘be suffering from such’ an inability.

. To be sure there are many things wrong with
“big weekends” as they currently exist. Many of the
circus side shows are not in congruence with the Dav-
idson student’s better qualities. There is too much of
an attempt to cram every minute with activity even
if much of it is admittedly meaningless.

But “off weekends” do not seem to be the real
issue that they were last year. The fall term schedule
is fairly complete, and we assume the pace will be
maintained all year.

The real problem is the grossly undue emphasis

on “big weekends” as the cure all for Davidson’s mas-
sive social ills (for an excellent statement of this pro-
blem the reader is referred to the PERcept columns
of Oct. 16 and 23).
_ Yet the solution to this unrealistic situation is the
immediate institution of coeducation on a massive scale
(a solution which the trustees have said is worthy but
impossible), not the abolishment of “big weekends.”

The petition of the ad. hoc committee asks that
the ee weekends” be scrapped to free money for
the hiring of more and better big name entertain-
ment. Yet to have this big entertainment on some
weekend would naturally make that weekend bigger
than all the rest and thus a “big weekend.” |

A. different approach must be taken to correct
the evils‘of ‘the. system. First the paternalistic
attitudes of the social controllers at Davidson, who
shuddér at the thought of any ‘change in the present
institutions besides proliferating them, must be broken.

Then perhaps a “big weekend” could be seen for
what ‘it is—a weekend. for which a more expensive
arom and a larger array of parties have been sched-
uled. ;

Once this more realistic attitude is approached,

perbene those in power here can be convinced that
: y must begin immediately. to. work for. coeduca-
tion. It-is ga? to-sit-back-as“the=trustees did
last winter and affirm the principle. of coeducation
without establishing the machinery to implement it.

Making A Joyful Noise

“Gimme that good old-time
religion,

Gimme that good old-irite
religion,

Gimme that good old-time
religion,

It's good enough for me.”

(Rock groups, a minister
with a blue turtleneck, slide
projections on the walls and
a movie collage are not pre-
cisely what’s ‘‘good for me,”’
but the ‘‘Celebration’’ Tues-
day night partook of the old-
time, revivalist flavor.

Joy is not characteristic
to typical American Protest-
ant church services; more
frequent is a sleepy bore-
dom. But the attitude striven
far in Dr. Don M. Wardiaw’s ©
presentation matches the
feeling | remember from my
aunt’s tent revivals, in rural
Tennessee.

Answered

ED. NOTE

Several points with re-
gard to the letter from Ray-
mond Lassiter ’73 need to
be made now which could
not be made last week be-
cause the editor was off
campus for several days.

Lassister’s main complaint
seemed to be that John Mc-

Lean wrote a story attribut- 5

ed to Steve Cross. It must
be noted that McLean was
working on the copy desk
that night and chose to re-
write the article by Cross
when it ‘revealed several
ambiguities.

Crossthen approved the
story on the basis of his
interview with Richard C.
Burts Jr. and did agree to
run his byline on. the story
which contained information
he .had gathered. . This pro-
cedure is customary.

We regret: that Lassister

“misunderstood the informa-
story to have —

uninhibitedly—or even being
uninhitbited. Too often the

bread or wine was refused, -

too many were only making
motions, too few forgot them-
selves in frenzy.

To make such a celebra-
tion work, participants have
fo forget their notions of
hygiene; for it is not time
when the bread is offered to
worry about catching hali-
tosis from the giver.

PAUL ROWLAND

The- people sang the Apo-
stles’.Creed, which as every
freshman Bible student
knows was a set of specific
answers to Second Century
heresies. To affirm belief in
specific; resurrection of the
body was incongruous in the
context of amorphous wor-
ship.

There was a feeling of joy
and group identity, albeit
occasionally rudely shatter-
ed by halitosophobes, but |
am not certain that this did
not come solely from the
music, the sitting in a dark-
ened room and the dancing.

Divinity was unto those
who committed themselves
to the celebration and to
their fellows. But fear that
unto the greater’ part was
only a party without enough

Getting Coeds
Beats Weekend

Dear C. Shaw Smith, -,
She thoroughly enjoyed it
(the -Homcoming extrava-
ganza, that is) but she didn’t
understand you at all.
When we ran into you
during halftime at the ‘foot-
ball fiasco, I mean game,
she knew you meant I was
undeserving, not she, when

you said, ‘He doesn’t de-
serve « you; he deserves
somebody else.”

On our way to the Kenny
Rogers and the First Edition
concert where. you called
down the hall ‘Let his date
in but no big weekends for
Rowland” she saw that you
were smiling as if you didn't
mean it,

And she managed to ig-
nore your remark before
ous visit to the Union Bar.

She listened attentively as
you and I talked before our
return to the Freeway
dance,

Remember? You said you
had two things to tell me.

The first was a very seri-
ous word: ‘‘money.’’ She
asked you to repeat it be-
cause you hadn't said it
very seriously.

The second was that there
are activities planned for
every weekend until Thanks-

giving. (How about after-
wards?)
Then she pondered the

Wailing Wall as I reminded
you that in addition to the

_column you found irksome,

I had written a favorable

“review of Steve Baron's
Hungry D.
As I pointed out your

numerous negative com-
ments on the column. and
silence on the complimen-
tary review, she was shock
ed at your loss for words
when I asked, “Why don’t
you people.be positive for a
change?”

You: see, Mr. Smith, like
you she had read the column
you found offensive, but un-
like you, she understood my
point. °

It’ was not an attack on

Big Weekends as such. Got
that?
I was merely dramatiz-
ing the already bizzarre.
Although many see the
concert format as outworn
and view the sideshows as

ROWLAND

absurd additions and the ex-
penditures as excessive:
that wasn’t’ the main point.

» Presently, the painful
truth is that many students
spend considerable time, ef-
fort and money on arrang-
ing for and _ recuperating
from weekend binges.

ft seems clear enough that
the goal of all this activity
is something pitifully ab-
sent ‘most of the week: fe-
male companionship.

What I said last week and
am now -repeating is that
coeducation is a more vi-
able solution to the pro-
blem.

Currently the main barrier
may summed up in one
serious word: money.

Now, it seems that David-
son wastes piles of green on
football, big weekends and
other follies and that these
funds could be spent more
effectively.

Football on this campus
is needed and appreciated
about..as much as _ prophy:
lactics'on a geriatric ward.

And big weekends do as
much for social starvation
‘as cotton candy for malnu-
trition.

(My- Houston friend was
here less than two days and
realized that: why can’t
you?

-Sincerely,
PJE.R.
