MORE LIBRARY CHANGES!

By SUE DONIM

From his office in New York today, Donald Trump announced a series

of changes to be made in the E. H. Little Library at Davidson College.
The announcement is the latest in a series which have issued from Trump’s headquarters

since his hostile takeover of the college last week.
The mostnoticeable immediate change will be the library’s name. Trump was quoted as saying “the damn
name’s just not right for a Trump-owned concern.”

Thenew name will be “The E.
H. Extremely Large and Opulent
Library.” The name will be added
above the front door of the library
in large platinum letters. Beneath
the name will be a long gold bar
with a “$” symbol incised just
below the “E” in “Extremely.”

Some staff changes will also
take place. Leland Park, Director
of the Library since 1976, has been
fired, and will be replaced by Mrs.
Imelda Marcos.

When questioned about her
qualifications as head of a major
college library, Trump replied,
“Meldie is a dear friend of mine. I
feel that her past experience in
acquiring vast numbers of things
will be useful as we try to triple the
number of books acquired each
year for the library.”

Dr. Chalmers Davidson. has
been named “College Archivist in
Perpetuity,” and has been
commissioned to oversee
preparations for events celebrating
the upcoming Bicentennial of the
College in 2037.

Dr. Davidson has already
decided that the centerpiece of the
celebration will be a vast pageant
and masque featuring all the alumni
whose families have attended
Davidson for three or more
generations and Contributed three
or more thousand dollars to the
endowment fund.

At the time of the takeover,
the library was in the process of
automating the card catalog and
various other functions. The very
expensive process will hopefully
be completed within the next two

days, thanks to Trump money.

Edward Proctor has been
promoted within the library to
Computer Czar, which will be
added to his duties as Assistant
Cataloguer, Assistant Head of
Reference Services, Assistant in
Circulation, Assistant to the Vice-
Head of Acquisitions, Assistant to
the Head of Assistants and General
Factotum.

Mary Beaty has been named
“author in residence” and has been
commissioned to do a thorough
revisionof her History ofDavidson
College, to reflect the benefits of
the Trump takeover.

But the most sweeping
changes will be architectural ones.
Trump has already hired architects
to completely renovate the library
within the next year, which, he
says, will make the facility “‘a real
doozy.”

The renovations are patterned
after the famous Trump Tower in
Manhattan. The current color
scheme, which Trump and others
have described as “nauseating
variations on a 1970’s puke

avocado green,” will be abandoned.

in favor of rose marble, grey carpet,
and black ceilings.

The, grand. staircase. will
become “The Dicky Harding
Memorial Cascade,” featuring a
gentle cascade of water from the

nd to the ground floor, lit at
night with rotating colored lights.
A glass elevator will take students
through the middle of the cascade
to the different floors.

Outside, the monumental

columns will be gilded and topped
with fresh acanthus leaves, which
will be changed daily. Gilded cages
and miniature gilded “pooper
scoopers” will be provided for the
pigeons.

The smoking room will
become a lounge featuring free
mixed drinks, caviar, and smoked
salmon. The entire library will be
fitted with a high-tech sound
system tied into WALT.

The reference collection will
be removed for a computerized
dance floor. Trump commented,
“we felt that the library as it was
did not reflect the interests and
desires of the students. This is what
those crazy kids want, and dammit,
we want to be a good neighbor.” |

Stack space and luxury
condominiums will begprovided in
a twenty story ultra-i#fodern tower
to be built on top of the current
building. While Chalmers
Davidson was speechless withrage
about this addition to the Davidson
skyline, Larry Ligo reacted
strangely by sticking his tongue
out at Dr. Davidson and saying
“nyah, nyah.”

While these many changes will
certainly make the library unique
among the schools with which it
likes to compare itself (Harvard,
Yale, Dartmouth, etc.), Trump
hopes that the renovated library

- will be the model for the future

college library:“‘A good place with
a lot of class. And big, too. I like
thinking big. If you’re going to
think anyway, you might as well
think big.”

LEAVES
LURID
ESTATE!

By CATHY
The Trump University campus was
rocked today as word leaked out from
lawyers on the estate of Bob the Carrot,
who killed himself last week in a last, fatal

fit of activism.

Bob’s brother, Robert the Republican Banana—
who is temporarily a kiwi fruit—flew in from the
coast late last week to settle the estate as its executor.
What he found, much to his astonishment, was a
bedroom full of pornography and, worse, a gory,
shockingly terrible basement strewn with the remains
of hundreds of Bob’s victims!

“It’s terrible,” Robert said. “We founda bloody Cuisinart in
the tool shed and piles and piles of cabbage, carrots and onions

in a compost heap in the
basement. The bedroom was
full of pornography and books
of cole slaw recipes.

“The funny thing is,”
Robert mused, “I had always
figured ol’ Bob out tobe gay.”

Early reports -from
lawyers indicate that Bob’s
investments ranged from
Romanian treasury bonds to
DeBeers stock. “It’s just
shocking,” said a spokesman
for Smith, Helms, Mulliss &
Moore, Bob’s attorneys. “We

thought he was gay, too.”
Bob left no note behind,
buthe was found withBartlett’ s

| Familiar Quotations on the

floor beneath his feet. The
bookmark was engraved “To
Bob—from Ivana” and had
been slipped into the book. On
that page—highlighted—was
a single quotation: “I like
thinking big. If you’re going to
be thinking anyway, you might
as well think big.—Donald
Trump”

Leland, Park, former director of the
library (1), and Will Terry, former dean
of students (r), have been reassigned by
the new Trump regime to T.U.’s newly
relocated Heritage USA, where they will
work as George and Astro Jetson.
