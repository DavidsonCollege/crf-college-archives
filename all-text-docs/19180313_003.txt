SCHEDULE.

Saturday, March 16—Eumenean—
Affirmative: Harrell. Heizer, W. J.
Huneycutt. Negative: Carwile, Brand.
McCutcheon. Declamations: McGirt,
Mc Pheeters.

Philanthropic—Affirmative: W. M.
Currie, R. R. Deaver. Negative: R.
D. Hall, J. A. Poteat. Oration: W. T.
Dunlap, Jr. Declamation: M. FE. Ed-

wards, Extemporaneous Debate: Affirm-
ative, W. F. Hall; negative, J. B. Cald-
well.

Owing to the fact that the regular
debaters were not present, both debates
in the Phi Society were extemporaneous.
The query for the regular extemporan-
cous debate was, “Resolved. ‘Vhat Da-
vidson should have a baseball team this
spring.” Boney was on the affirmative
and L. L. Wilson was on the negative.
The query for the regular debate was,
“Resolved, That the Presidential can-
didate should be nominated by a direct
primary instead of a National Conven-
tion.”

R. D. Hall and M. A. Fiske were ap-
pointed on the affirmative. R. D. Free-
man and ‘TV. N. Morton upheld the
negative side of the question.

The debate, because of the short no-
tice given the debaters, showed lack of
preparation and .the debaters tried to
make up in near-oratory and superheat-
ed atmosphere what they lacked of facts.

The orations were both on the pro-
gress of our country in preparing for
the war and they were decidedly opti-
mistic in their outlook. §. M. Davis

spoke on “The Expansion of Our
Armies.” He showed how that our na-

tional army had increased from a negli-
gible factor to a great fighting machine.
In speaking of “Some Phases of Our
‘Acroplane Program,” E.G. Lilly show-
ed how we have not only fulfilled but
have excelled our aeroplane program.

In the Eumenean Society the debate
each

was excellent. The debaters
brought out several good points and put
some real old-time “pep” in their
speeches.

The debaters on the affirmative side
were Potts, Good and Brand. Those
opposing were Love, Liston and Or-
gain.

Following the debate two declama-
tions were given. L.. Mahood gave
“The Star-Spangled Banner” and W.
P. Cumming rendered “The Immortal-
ity of the Soul.”
