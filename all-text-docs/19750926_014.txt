Several games rained out —

Freshmen pull upsets in flickerball

If, and only if, this were the
best of all possible worlds,
IMAC sports would indeed be
enjoyable.

A ref would be more relaxed
and able to make more correct
calls, as players would not have
their teeth sunk into his back.

Play would be spontaneous.

Losses would provide no
dissappointment or frustration
(a thing which abounds here on

campus due to a lack of
regression).
And, of course, it would
never rain.

However, seeing how the
opening day provided two rain-
outs and two victories for
freshman teams, we are faced
with the startling conclusion
that this is not the best of all
possible worlds. And, there-
fore, the IMAC situation is
nothing as described above.

Basically, an IMAC player is
like a Puritan-one who lives
with the haunting fear that
someone, somewhere is happy.

Likewise, IMAC players live
in the constant fear that some
game, somewhere is being
played fairly and for pleasure.

They can’t take that chance,
though, because playoff time
is always looming ahead, as are
those prestigious Patterson
Court points.

SAE’s and KA’s practice
early with vigorous ball hand-
ling drills. SPE’s have a secret
playbook written in blood
(punishable by death upon its
loss).

And freshmen don’t seem to
be able to get it out of their
heads that a high school football
coach is no longer looking over
them to insure the proper
amount of salivation and knee-
crushing blocks.

Therefore, an IMAC player
tends generally to be a frust-
rated jock who may also be a
nerd, a spaz, a pigeon-eyes, or
any other name you care to
think of.

Fellas, let’s have a good year.

to work with on and off the
field. Let’s be kind, generous
and get “whack-oed” before

every game.

Now some of you cretans out
there might quote the late
Vince Lombardi (no doubt part
of your poly-sci reading list) in
asking, “If they don’t care who
wins, why do they keep the
score?” We don’t know. Why do
chickens have lips?

Now down to IMAC.There
were two unbeievable upsets
on Monday as freshmen teams
from 4th and basement of
Richardson scored victories
over wily veteran teams.

The top of the dorm beat
Emanon, 13-6. The bottom
tumbled PIKA’s empire hopes
by the same score.

When freshmen win its
either because they practiced
or the other team was in
wheelchairs. Either way, it is a

pity.

But don’t take this too hard,
Freshmen, for no matter how
much of a turkey you are, there
at least three upperclassmen
who have got you beat.

In rain-out action, Joe
Banana and His Bunch (who list
a mysterious blond figure
resembling Bjorn Borg) never
saw the men of ETC. show.

Rumor, however, surrounds
the SPE game against the
Borgs. We have heard that the
SPE’s came up short by one
touchdown (alright, who lost
the playbook?) due to the
overpowering talents of former
hall counselor John Mitchell.

Commissioner Bowie,
however, had no. score card
turned into IMAC Central. The
affair seems to be hushed-up.

Still, the OPE house is in
darkness tonight as the search
continues for evidence of a
match in ashes amid the vast
expanse of the flickerball fields.

As predictions seem to be
inevitable, we have carefully
studied the rosters and are
prepared to list those teams
who should be outrageously

mediocre’ this flickerball

season.

“Pat’s Dirty Old Men” has
shown great promise of flound-
ering around .500 in pre-season
work-outs. Headed by Pat
“Looker” Drake, the squad also
sports stand-outs such as Chip
“Turd”’Stone, “the. Sterling”
Jeff Frank, “the frank” sterling
Martin, and the powerful Leo
Valiente.

But as listless as “Pat’s Dirty
Old Men,may be, the Kerwood
Derbies are our unquestionable
choice for the team most likely
not to distinguish themselves in
any way. A glance at their
roster reveals several ghost
players such as Sam Upchurch
74, T. Jay Pecorak '74 (you
freshmen better pray that he
doesn’t show up), Sam Spencer
‘40 (who had no comment to
make on anything) and Laura
Lortz "78 (they can’t be that
big!).

Along with their combined
running and passing skills, the
Derbies. will be _ highly
mediocre.

All other teams will either be
better or worse.
