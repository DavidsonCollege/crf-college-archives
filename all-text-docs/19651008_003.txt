discouraging hardships, David-
son's four good-will ambassa-
dors to Ecuador and their three

female co-workers from Queens,

Charlotte College, and Sacred

Heart managed to safely com-.

plete their two-month visit for
PRAM with the feeling, accord-
ing to PRAM leader Erskine
Sproul, of having “lessened the
immensity of misunderstanding
by the Ecuadorians concerning
the U. S., while ‘‘gaining a
great deal of insight’ which
they hope to share with as many
people as possible in this coun-
try.

The trip began for the seven
wayfarers on June 12 at Miami's
airport, where they boarded one
of the two liners owned by
Ecuatorians de Aviacion and
headed for Quito. thé Andean
mountain city which. is almost
exactly on the equator and is
capital of the Nevada-sized coun-
try of Ecuador.

Action began as soon as they
arrived. as Richardson Scholar
Fred Ehlers met them and in-
formed them of a radio inter.
view scheduled for the group
that night, the first of numer-
ous such programs staged by
PRAM and the Voice of Youth
(the sister organization in Ecua-
dor) for the benefit of Ecuador:
ian audiences.

The programs generally con-
sisted of interviews or talks with
members of the group alternat-
ing with American and Latin
folk music, played and sung by
the duo of Seroul and Doug
Pratt. Running from fifteen to
thirty minutes, these programs
were the chief means of com-
munication from PRAM to the
masses.

The “‘gringos'“ initial place
of residence in Quito was the
brand-new dormitory at the
Central University of Ecuador.
featuring completely unsound-
proofed rooms, littie water, no
heat, and co-ed living. Notes
Pratt, ‘That last item sort of
made up for the other odd fea-
tures.”

Three days after their arrival,
the seven made their ill-fated
first appearance before a live
audience. the student body of a
middle class high school. After
members. had _ presented
PRAM's program. and ideas to
the students, the floor was open-
ed for discussion.

Comments PRAM's president,
“We got wiped out. Several
young Communists took the floor
and went off on a barrage of
accusations and criticisms of the
U. S. and democracy for over
an hour. We were completely
unprepared for such an encoun-
ter and the meeting was only
ended when the rector of the
school finally turned the Com-
munists off."

The experience did serve the
purpose of preparing the group
for discussions in the future,
insuring that they would not go
anywhere else without being
prepared to counter such argu-
ments. .

The next several days were
filled with more radio programs,
tours of medical facilities (‘‘un-
believably filthy and antiquat-
ed’), graduation parties, fight-
ing the traffic of Quito (host
Cesar Andrade, now a Richard-
son Scholar, wasn’t too lucky
and ran the group’s car into a
monastery wall), a meeting with
the personnel of the U. S. em-
bassy (‘we were not very im-

pressed’), an anonymous threat
to bomb the group’s dorm, more
meetings with students, and
sightseeing.

Most informative to the group

‘was a four-hour, non-heated dis.

cussion with the leaders of the
national student organization.
the Federation of University Stu-
dents of Ecuador (F.E.U.E.).,
most of whose leaders are Com-
munists.

Also interesting was an inter-
view with former President Galo
Plaza.

Next on the agenda was a six-
teen-hour bus trip to Cuenca,
Ecuador's third largest city, }o-
cated in the mountains of the
southern part of the country.

Here the now-weary seven
talked to the mayor and several
government officials, and were
interviewed by the city’s daily
newspaper.

Among those the group talked
to was Cueva Tamariz, leader
of the Socialist Party and a

-leading candidate for President

in the tentative spring elections.

They also visited, among other
things. the Ecuadorian-owned
and operated General Tire Fac-
tory, one of the few well-run
and efficient industries in Ecua-
dor.

‘*Ecuador’s economy is almost
entirely agrarian,” says Sproul,
“with most of the nation's in-
come being derived from the ba-
nana plantations of the coastal
plains. They produce 25 per
cent of the world's bananas, but
dependence on this single item
is risky because of increasing
plant disease increasing com-
petition from Central America,
and a widely fluctuating mar-
ket.

“The great need in Ecuador
is for more industry: such as
the tire industry in Cuenca.’

Returning to Quito on the day
scheduled for a riot by certain
political groups. the North Amer-
ican visitors moved out of the
University’s dorm, which now
appeared not to be the safest
place around, and into private
homes of the members of the
Voice of Youth.

Concerning the riots, Sproul
notes that ‘Most Americans
don't realize that Ecuador is
ruled by a military junta which
overthrew an incompetent presi-
dent in 1963. The people now
tired of a dictatorship, are get-
ting impatient for the junta to
make definite plans concerning
long awaited elections which will
return the nation to democratic
rule. Thus political disturbances
such as this are becoming in-
creasingly frequent.”

The students of the F.E.U.E,
incensed about four of their
leaders who had been exiled.
had their own riot a couple of
davs ‘later.

“However”, Sproul points out.
“they stayed at the edge of the
university campus, where they
were immune from police ac-
tion. The American Cultural
Center, with its big glass win-
dows, was conveniently located
across the street and soon had
no windows.”

“Unfortunately for the riot-
ers, their leader momentarily
stepped over the campus boun-
dary line and was quickly grab-
bed by police and shipped out of
the country also.”

More tours, interviews, and
radio programs followed, in-
cluding inspections of a Cath-
olic. school for the deaf and
dumb (‘‘very impressive’) and
of the local prison and a talk
with chief of police.

The PRAM delegates also vis-
ited the Alliance for Progress of-
tice, where they discovered that
“there are about ten guys in the
office for every one. ont in the
tield.”

“Still,” says Sproul, “the Al-
Nance has done an awful lot of

good in Ecuador. Yet they re-
ceive a tremendous amount of
criticism and their motives are
greatly misunderstood by the
people.”

Near the end of July, the
group traveled down to Quaya-
quil on the coast, Ecuador's
largest city and its major port.
Besides taping more radio pro-
grams here, they also conduct-
ed an hour-long prime-time tele-
vision show about PRAM.

In addition to another hospital
tour, the seven stalwarts also
tdlked to the editors of Guaya-
quil’s two leading newspapers
and interviewed several business
and political figures, including
Carlos Arroyo del Rio, a past
Ecuadorian president, and Raul
Clemente Huerta. a narrowly-de-
feated liberal] presidential can-
didate.

The Peace Corps personnel
they met in Guayaquil as in all
Ecuador were particularly note-
worthy to Sproul, who was im-
pressed with the enthusiasm for
and acceptance of the Peace
Corps by the Ecuadorians.

“The Peace Corps,” says
Sproul, ‘‘is the best ambassador
the U. S. has.”

A series of parties and meet-
ings where the PRAM program
was evaluated and policy formu-
lated concluded the group's ‘stay
in Ecuador after their return to
Quito.

Although helping Ecuadorians
to understand the United States
and its “gringos’’ was a prime
objective of the PRAM trip..an
almost equally important result
by PRAM's envoys was the in-
creased understanding of Ecua-
dor, its people, and its prob-
lems.

part of the future plans of
PRAM. Spokesman Erskine

Sprou) outlined the new plans ing to projects such as this. This

for PRAM’s development in the
next year, emphasizing the need
for expansion in financial re-
sources,

Of the $8,000 collected Jast
year, $5,000 was spent in the
program this summer, and the
other $3,000 has already been al-
located for other projects this
year.

The projects on hand include
$1,000 to be spent in Ecuador
for further organization, and
$1,000 to be spent for operations
in this country. Another $1,000
is to be spent for a magazine
intended to attract new financial
support.

Sproul stated that there will
be anether fund drive later this
year to raise funds for next sum-
mer’s exchange, but expressed
hope that a trust fund could be
arranged through a donation by
one of the large foundations,
possibly the Ford Foundation or
the Rockefeller Foundation, thus
providing the necessary funds
without an annual fund drive to
provide the money. The fund
could insure the needed funds
and could be enlarged as new
contributions were added. He
pointed out that it would take
around $800,000 in the trust fund
to provide the necessary funds.

The Project of the Americas’
most precious ideals are fixed in
something which has seemed a
dream of a long time, but which
has now begun to become a
great. reality. At the price of
many headaches and sleepless
nights, we have proven that it
is not an impossible goal we
havé chosen, and that the road
is open to the future.

In PRAM we are trying to
give youths a real opportunity
to make of the Americas a Jand
where people are occupied in
building truths without having to
combat. lies, a place where so-
ciety is ‘truly devoted to the
well-being of each of its mem.
bers.

Our belief is in the inevitable
necessity of knowing each other,
in the necessity of doing some-
thing which really helps us work
together, in other words, in a
strong bond, not an easily-dis-
solved shallow acquaintance.

“None of us will ever be the
same,"' one of PRAM's students
said. ‘It was like looking into
a mirror and seeing the good
and bad things about my coun-
try. The trip may change my
life I think I'd like to go back
to South America for a career.
With an education and some
capital, I could help in my small
way to raise their standard of

living.”

This is more than an article,
it is a mesasge addressed to

.

the conscience of the youth who
realizes that he and others his
age will shape the realities of
the future. It is addressed to
those who want to give a mo.

ment of their lives to better un- °

derstanding among humans. It
is addressed to those who wish
to face. the problems of the un-
der-developed world: at a time
when their help.is vitally need:
ed.

One of our aims is to create
a new Amefican conscience. I
think that this has already be-
gun. The first seven United
States students who went to
Ecuador last summer all have
now a new understanding and
knowledge of their South Ameri-
ean neighbors, and likewise. the
South Americans they met have
a new understanding of them.

I like to look at our world as
a nest in which we have placed
many hopes. It is a world in
which we. are making our own

destiny, and one in which Ameri-
can youth can be the rising sun
of the promised dawn of inter-
American understanding and
friendship.

There is a place and an op-
portunity in PRAM for everyone

tering the misconceptions North
and South Americans have of
each other. I welcome any in-
quiries from the Davidson stu-
dent body.

Student Affairs, and is concern-
ed with inter-American’ ex-
change.

At the same time Simpson will
contact various firms in the
Gulf Coast ‘area who are close-
ly connected with Latin America
and South America both finan-
cially and culturally.

Plans were made this summer
for enlarging the number of
local chapters both in the United
States and in South America.
The national organization would
consist of a president, vice-presi-
dent, secretary, treasurer, and
a coordinator. Each local chap-
ter would be organized on this
same structure.

As soon as it {s feasible, na.
tional elections will be held
without the stipulation that the
center of the organization re-
main at Davidson, although the
national secretary and the treas-

the Davidson office of

“Student-conceived, student-controll-
ed, student-operated”’ reads a

urer would remain at Davidson

‘to be immediately accessible to

the records and the finances.
The coordinator will keep in
touch with the local chapters
and distribute any information.

Money collected by the locals
would be divided with a per-
centage going to the national
and the rest being used to de-
fray the expenses of the Jocal.

Glenn Withrow is in charge of
ail expansion, and hopes to add
Carolina, Duke, State, Tulane.
LSU, and the University. of Hous-
fon to the already existing chap-
ters. Those already established
include Queens, Sacred Heart,
UNC-Charlotte, and Trinity Uni-
versity of Texas.

Fred Ehlers, from a new
PRAM office in Quito, is pres-
ently working on expansion, and
plans to enlarge the scope to
include chapters in Peru, Pana-
ma, and Colombia in 1966.

There are plans for expanding
the exchange program to fif-
teen students, an increase of
eight, from this country visit-
ing Latin America and fifteen
Latin American students visit-.

An excursion into the jungles
of Ecuador and a trip to Peru
were additional highlights of the
summer for several of PRAM's
travelers following their work
in Ecuador.

Glenn Withrow. Doug Pratt.
David Walker and an Ecuador-
ian PRAM member left Quito,
capital of Ecuador, and headed
toward the Ecuador jungle on
August 5. Travelling at first by
bus, they were equipped with a
tent, cooking utensils and a shot-
gun.

During the trip the bus was
stopped by a landslide, and all
of the passengers had to walk
around the obstructed road to
catch another bus on the other
side. Once they had to run to
avoid falling rocks.

On the following day the
PRAM contingent was stopped
by the army at a checkpoint
and told by a colonel that they
could proceed no further with-
out additional papers from the
director of the armed forces in
Quito.

However, the boys explained
their predicament to a mission-
ary, who in turn spoke to a
friendly army captain. After the
colonel left, the boys were a)-
lowed to proceed past the check-
point, leaving their passports as
security.

That night the group met two
Americans working in Ecuador
who recognized them and said,
“Oh, you're the gringoes the
army is looking for.’’ The boys
sneaked through the next check-
point.

After crossing a river by cable
car. the boys arrived at Tena. a
town in the jungle ten miles
from the site where five mis-
slonaries were killed by the
Acua Indians in 1960.

Guided by a Peace Corps
worker, the boys travelled five
miles deeper into the jungle by
dugout canoe. Twenty-five per-
sons had drowned in the river
during the previous two days
when their boats had been
caught in rapids.

Finally arriving at a small
village in the jungle, the group
found what appeared to Withrow
as a Utopia. ‘Everything was
quiet and peaceful. Every now
and then you'd hear a baby cry
or a dog bark. You could hear
the noise of the river 100 feet
away,” he sald.

On the hill surrounding the
village were plots of land where
crops were grown. The houses
in the village were made of
bamboo and kept very clean.
The PRAM crew learned from
thelr guide that the village had

all of the heavy work.

The villagers were very peace-
ful. Few could read or write,
and they had no concept of the
United States or Russia. When
asked if they needed anything
the villagers smiled and replied,
“No. we have everything.”

‘We felt strange inside when
we left the village.” Withrow
commented.

After leaving the jungle and
returning to Quito, Withrow left
the group and traveled alone to
Peru on August 12. While there
he visited a Peruvian boy from
Charlotte who attended UNC-
Charlotte. Withrow also jour-
neyed throughout the country in-
vestigating the possibilities for
introducing PRAM’s programs
to Peru next summer.

Visiting the cities of Lima,
Arequipa, Cuzco (the capital of
the Inca empire 2000 years ago).
and Puno, Withrow talked with
university students, Peace Corp
workers, city officials and busi-
nessmen. Almost all of them
liked the idea behind PRAM and
offered assistance to the pro-
gram.

At the universities, Withrow
talked PRAM with the students,
a large number of them being
Communists. Most of them had
