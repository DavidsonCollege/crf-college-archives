Davidson Town Board ponders housing development

By ELIZABETH KISS
News Editor

A proposed housing project may add
150 new houses to the town of Davidson
in the next three to five years. In the
long run, the project could even be large
enough to double the town’s population.

Synco, Inc., a Charlotte-based de-
veloper, has applied to the town for a
Special Use permit to build 150 houses in
a 35 acre tract off of Griffith Street, the
road leading to I-77.

While Synco has no definite construc-
tion plans beyond the initial 150 units,

Laundry service attacked

some town residents are concerned that
such a housing development could
destroy Davidson’s small-town identity
and create too great a demand for the use
of the small lake adjoining the develop-
ment site.

The Davidson Planning Board re-
viewed Synco’s proposal and recom-

mended that the Town Board grant the‘

Special Use permit. However, its report
emphasized that granting a permit
‘‘constitutes approval of the overall
concept’’ and not of the details of
Synco’s plan.

At its meeting last Tuesday the Town
Board voted to refer some of the special
considerations raised by the Planning
Board to an ad hoc committee. This
committe will meet with Synco repre-
sentatives this week. Once the commit-
tee resolves these considerations, the
Town Board will consider issuing a
permit.

The Special Use permit is necessary
because the proposed development
would include townhouses, which are not
covered by Davidson zoning laws,
according to Synco Project Officer John

Yelverton.
_ If a Special Use permit were issued,
Synco would then have to develop
detailed engineering plans which meet
the town subdivision ordinances, accord-
ing to Mayor Nancy MacCormac.
The major areas of concern identified
by the Planning Board included:
—Synco’s request for a variance in the
zoning laws allowing them to build a 20
foot wide roadway without a curb. Town
ordinance requires residential roads
without curbs and gutters to be 24 feet

MasterCharge

By SCOTT EBLIN
Staff Writer

Piedmont Bank is becoming
stricter with students who have
MasterCharge cards.

The bank has recently had
problems with students’ exceed-
ing the $300 credit limit and
missing payments. Vice-Presi-
dent Donald Howie said Pied-
mont was faced with either
ending its MasterCharge pro-
gram with Davidson students
or trying to correct abuses. He
described the bank’s attitude in
this way: ‘Instead of killing the
whole program, let’s attack it
where the problems are.”

Howie said the bank mailed
letters to student cardholders
this week detailing its Master-
Charge policy. The letters speci-
fied the following guidelines:

—Students can use Master-
Charge only while they are
enrolled in Davidson. As soon
as they graduate or leave, their
cards are void.

—Cards will expire one year
after issue. The bank will decide
to reissue cards on the basis of
how reponsible students were
in using them.

—The bank will strictly en-
force the $300 MasterCharge
credit limit. The first time a
student goes over his limit, the
bank will take his card away
and not return it until the
student’s balance is $150 or
less. The second time a student
does so, the bank will revoke
the card permanently.

—The bank will also be less
tolerant of delinquent pay-
ments. The first time a student
misses a payment, the bank will
send him a warning letter. The

The cost of service in the
College owned and operated
laundry has been included in the
student Comprehensive Fee
since the 1920’s. This year the
cost was $200. The students
complained that the mandatory
fee was unfair to those who did
their own laundry since they
had to pay for a service they did
not use.

Senior Karen Hester suggest-
ed that laundry service be made
optional to allow students to
save money. The laundry could
also offer differing degrees of
service so that students would
pay for only what they used.

Because of the College’s and
town’s small size and the lack of
summer business, Currie said,
the College has not been able to
find a firm to run the laundry.
“To continue the laundry, we
must continue to pro-rate the
cost to all students,’’ Currie
said.

The students argued that an
optional service system would
not harm the laundry’s business
since few students would choose
not to use the full service.

Currie did express interest in
the option of offering differing
degrees of service. At his re-

Trustees, faculty agree on computer needs

By ANNE GOODWIN
Staff Correspondent
Both the Board of Trustees
and the Davidson faculty have
given a vote of confidence to the
expansion of Davidson’s com-
puter services.
Computer Services Director
Robert DeSieno said he spoke
-before the Board of Trustees
two weeks ago about the Col-

ein, Gertrude Stein, te Love

lege’s need for a new computer
system. In his report DeSieno
emphasized that Davidson
must modernize so that it will
not fall behind other liberal arts
colleges.

According to DeSieno, the
Trustees reacted affirmatively
in an informal ‘‘declaration of
sentiment”’ and said that they
will work with College President,

Samuel Spencer in raising the
necessary funds.

Spencer reported that in their
October 7 meeting the faculty
passed a motion expressing
their support for DeSieno and
for an expanded computer ser-
vice. Such a show of faculty
support could aid in obtaining a
National Science Foundation
grant for the computer center
Spencer said.

DeSieno said that although
no firm decisions have been
made about the manufacturer or
cost of the new system, the
plans call for an ‘interactive,
time-sharing”’ system. An in-
teractive system'uses video
screens and typewriter termin-
als instead of punch cards.
Time-sharing is a process by
which the computer can handle
several programs at the same
time. :

One of the goals of the
Computer Services Center, De-
Sieno said, is to encourage
student participation. Student
access to the computers is
limited now because students
must use punch cards to run

_ programs.

The new system will include
about forty terminals located all
around campus, including in
dormitories. The terminals will
be clustered in groups of four to
encourage an exchange of ideas
