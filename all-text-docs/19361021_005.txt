COMPLETE ORIENTATION

As one of the last phases of

the orientation period for|
freshmen, the Y. M,C. A has, |
for the last several weeks, |

been inviting groups of fresh
men, along with their ‘faculty
and student advisers, to meet
at the Social Center for an in
formal “get acquainted” hour.

About thirty freshmen are invited
each time, and for every fifteen
freshmen there is one faculty mem-
ber, serving as adviser. Also, a
member of the “Y” cabinet is as-
signed to each fifteen boys, as stu-
dent adviser. The purpose of the

socials is to give the boys a chance
to meet the faculty and their wives,
and vice. versa

This work is being conducted by
Wade Boggs, who is in’ charge of
Work on the Y. M. C
A. cabinet, and “Mac” McClure,
General Secretary of the “Y.” The

first of these meetings was held on

One has been held every Tuesday
since that time and thus far, ap

In about two or three weeks more

the work will have been completed

Besides informal conversation,
there are usually several talks, hum
orous and otherwise, which are

given. Mac McClure has one that,
in the words of Boggs “has become
as necessary a part on the program
as the refreshments that are served
toward the close.”
