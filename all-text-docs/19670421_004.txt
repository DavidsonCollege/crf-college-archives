UNIQUE CENTER FOR KIDS

-Year-Olds Enjoy Education,-

By JIM COOLEY
Staff Writer

Scarcely a half mile from Da-
vidson's campus a unique ex-
periment in learning is under-
way.

Many of the members of the
newly-formed faculty at the
Child Development Center have
familiar names—Ostwalt. Kel-
ton, Woodfin, Sailstad. The cur-
riculum is almost wholly inter-
disciplinary.

Tuition is free. and there exists
a student-faculty ratio of about
eight to one. Best of all. this is
a school where learning should
be a pleasure: there are no
grades.

The site of this project is what
used to be Ada Jenkins School.
but it is now known as a Child
Development Center.

FOCAL POINT

The center opened its doors in
February through funds provid-
ed by Title I of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act
(ESEA), and it now has become
the focal point in the lives of
166 five-year-olds who are pres-
ently enrolled. ;

Mrs. J. H. Ostwalt. principal
of the center, states that its
main purpose is ‘to help a five-
year-old have as many exper-
iences as he can take.” Getting
the children ready for school is
not the purpose, she emphasized.
but rather development of the
child “where he is right now.”

The need for the school--and
the forthcoming federal aid is
the result. of the fact that so
many families in the area have
an annual income of less. than
$2000.

MISCONCEPTION

Many parents kept their chil.
dren away at first because they
were given the false impression
that. the kindergarten was for
children of low income families
only. Mrs. Ostwalt was quick to
point out that. ‘‘once the need
was. established. anyone could
come.” .

A bulletin board outside the
principal's office emphasizes the
five main areas of development
which the center promotes —
mental, social, physical. emo-
tional and spiritual.

This type of development is
achieved when aspects of lan.
guage arts. social studies, phy
sical education. manipulative
arts, music. number concepts
and natural sciences .are inter.
related into a single program.

SUMMER.

The school will run through
Aug. 24 due to the fact that
federal funds were not available

until! February. More children
continue to join the program
each week. and registration is
already underway for the next
term, which will begin in Sep-
tember.

The staff of nine teachers,
nine assistant teachers, three
aids. a full-time social worker.
a full-time nurse and a full
time nutritionist is, like the
school itself, fully integrated.

At present 45 per cent of the
students are white. and 55 per
cent are Negro. In each class,
if the teacher is white then the
assistant teacher is Negro and
vice-versa.

BUS RIDE

A typical day at the school be-
gins with a ride on the bus. A
period of free time follows and
then the students are served
breakfast.

After breakfast they go to
their rooms to plan the morn-
ing’s' work period with the teach-
er. The school day is ended with
lunch and an afternoon rest
period.

But many days are not at all
typical and may include a visit
to the fire station, the dentist's
office or to the Davidson Col-
lege library.

DISCRETION

Activity during the morning
work period is left. for the most
part. to the students’ own dis-
cretion. But. the guiding influ-
ence of the teachers usually
-channels these activities into a ,;

variety of areas.
id ;

_If a student is interested in
only one area to the neglect of
all others. the teacher will as-
sign him to some of the other
activities in order to give him
the variety of experiences which
it is the center's purpose to pro-
vide.

Many of the activities in which
the children are participating
how are geared to give them a
fuller appreciation of the beauty
of spring. Almost all the classes
have planted grass and other
plants in window boxes for ob
servation.

Abernethy To Study
Re'igions, History

Dr. George L. Abernethy. pro
fessor of philosophy, has been
awarded a fellowship for next
year in the Cooperative Human-
ities Program of Duke Univer-
sity and the University of North
Carolina.

Raymond Martin. a doctoral
candidate in philosophy at the
University of Rochester, will
take Abernethy's place next
year.

As a part of the program sup.
ported by the Ford Foundation,
Abernethy will be in residence
next year at Duce where he will
do further research in Asian re-
ligions and Muslim history.

Abernethy and Dr. Thomas A.
Langford, Chairman of the De-
partment of Religion at Duke
University, have recently com-
pleted a revision of their Phitos-
ophy of Religion.

The Macmillan Co. expects to:

publish this second edition in
January, 1968.

ture traffic signs were set up to
test the students’ skill in maneu-
vering their vehicles, but. most
preferred the open ‘‘road" and
getting the most speed out of
their machines.

Outdoor equipment is just now
arriving for the‘school. and, at
present, the most popular out-
door activity appears to be
climbing over and hiding in
empty wooden crates in which
other material has arrived.

The school contains 12 rooms
which are used by the students.

CARE

The most noticeable aspect of
each room is the care with
which all equipment has been
handled. The rooms stay neat
because the students are requir-
ed to clean up their classrooms
after each work period.

There are no chairs in the
room except for those in which
the teacher and her assistant
are seated. The children sit on
the carpet in a semicircle at
their teacher's feet in a manner
reminiscent of the ancient Greek
students. During rest periods
they lie on their own mats on
the floor.

When the.students are not lis-
tening to the teacher in this
manner, they are busily engag-
ed in one of the corners of the
very large, well lighted and well.
ventilated rooms.

EQUIPMENT

A large variety of equipment

from a miniature kitchen to

i goldfish bowls is available to

keep them from becoming bored
with any set routine. Miniature
carpenter equipment will soon
be available to further strength.

tivity. ‘

The students’ work is attrac-
tively displayed on bulletin
boards around the room. The
students of one class drew
sketches of the members of
their families, others tried shap.
ing their houses out of cardboard
boxes and still others were in-
troduced to the art, of finger
painting.

No Desmond, No Sign
Plague Brubeck Group

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

It took a homemade highway
sign and a lot of luck to reunite
the Dave Brubeck Quartet for
last Saturday's concert.

For:a while it was the Dave
Brubeck Quartet Minus One as
alto sax player Paul Desmond
tried to locate Davidson. Con-
struction workers had removed
the sign marking the Davidson
turn-off on Highway 21. and that
is when the trouble started.

Brubeck, traveling with drum-
mer Joe Morello and bassist Eu-
gene Wright. missed the turn
earlier in the evening. but they
reversed themselves and found
it the next time around.

But they feared that Desmond.
who was traveling by himself.
would not be so lucky. They

‘were right, for Desmond did not

show up at concert time.

Meanwhile, out on the high-
way, Tony DeBruyn, freshman
member of the. Union Board.
was positioning a handmade sign
that read, **Paul Desmond, Da
vidson Next Right.”

‘‘We didn't have enough large
‘D's’,”’*DeBruyn later said, ‘*so
we left one off the.end of ‘Des-
mond.’ and one out of ‘David-
son’."

The sign paid off. Desmond
arrived 10 minutes before inter-
mission. During intermission, he
told his story:

“It was late when I passed
the sign."’ Desmond said, ‘‘so I
saw it out of the corner of my
eye. F saw the words ‘Desmon’
and ‘Davidson.’ ‘but 1 thought
that there was a town named

as sauerkraut and cole slaw.

The health room under the di-

at first a very unpopular spot
for students. But Mrs. Ostwalt.
notes that the students now go
there for the most minute ail-

The health of the entire cen-

ing good health and nutritional

that all students get enough to

dent is not properly fed at.home,

“I wasn't expecting to see a
sign addressed to me. So I kept
on going. The next sign of civil-
ization I came to was the Ben-
evolent and Protective Order of
Elks restaurant. I went inside
to ask directions, but all the
waitresses were busy,’’ Desmond
continued.

‘When I asked where David-

thing like. ‘Oh, I don’t know.
Ask the girl over there.’ Fortu-
nately, there was a Davidson
