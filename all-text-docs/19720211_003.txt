Cornell Discusses
Bookstore Location

By ALAN FORD

Although no definite site has
yet been selected for the book-
store for next year, several sites
are under consideration, accord-
ing to Vice President for Fi-
nance and Development C. Da-
vid Cornell.

There are about 12 sites under
consideration by the college.
Some four to six sites are locat-
ed uptown and were not listed
specifically, but grouped togeth-
er.

Cornell said that they were
not named for fear that such a
declaration of interest would
drive up prices if the college
decided to pursue a plan involv-
ing one of these sites.

*‘Now,” he said, ‘‘the college’s
lawyers are checking into the
question of whether or not such
a move would affect Davidson's
tax free status for the book-
store.”

Another possibility would in-
volve moving the present per-
manent building housing the
bookstore over to a location near
Jaekson Court. This would be
the most expensive plan, but the
building could be put to good use
if and when the bookstore is
included in a new Union Build-
ing, Cornell stated.

Another alternative is to put
the bookstore in what is now the
supply room of the ROTC de-
partment in the basement of
Belk dorm. Cornell said that all
ROTC supplies have been clear-
ed from this area and that the
room now stands vacant.

The final alternative voiced by
Cornell was to erect a tempo-
rary building, such as a ‘‘But-
ler” building, to house the book-
store. Such a_ building would
probably be built near Patter-
son Court.

If this plan is used, the tem-
porary building will be moved
to another location and used for
storage after the bookstore is
moved to a permanent site. Cor-
nell said that the college is des-
perately in need of storage
space.

Cornell said that a final deci-

sion on placement of the book-
store is expected in about a
month. The determining factors
in picking a site are cost, acces-
sibility to the students, and long-
range usage (if the present
building is moved), he said.

Peter Nicholls said that of the
possible sites he thought the
most likely would be the base-
ment of Belk. ‘‘This place is
available, and availability is an
important factor,” he stated.

When asked about an uptown
move, he had this to say: ‘I’m
against a central location up-
town because of competition be-
tween the college store and up-
town merchants. It also would
be pretty far for students to
walk. I am in favor of a fringe
location, such as the site of the
old Davidson College medical
building.”

Davidson explorers triumph over Gilley Cave.

As Spelunkers Enter

By BILL GIDUZ

Speaking only from the experi-
ence incurred in a single ven-
ture, I have concluded that cav-
ing can easily be explained in
Freudian terms. Your superego
tells you that everything is fine
and everything will be all right,
while your id harbors pure, raw
terror.

My somewhat limited experi-
ence with the sport occurred
last weekend on a trip with
eight other members of the Da-
vidson College Outing Club. Gil-
ley Cave in Pennington Gap,
Virginia, was chosen as the ob-
ject of our endeavor, and it
turned out to be an excellent
choice.

After arriving in Pennington
Gap we begam our search for
the uncommercialized cave. One
local housewife told us quite
emphatically, ‘‘Ya’ll goin’ in
thar? I went in thar once with

my husband when we'z courtin’
but I shore _ wouldn’t do it
again!”

Our confidence having been
sufficiently bolstered, we finally
located the cave halfway up a
steep hillside.

At a home near the bottom of
the hill we all had to sign in
and tell the inhabitants when
we were planning to emerge, so
they could call the rescue squad
if we didn’t happen to find our
way out.

Those of us who were virgins
at the sport were introduced to
its finer points quickly. We had
to crawl on our stomachs
through mud for the first 10
feet or so.

Once inside we consulted our
map, but reading a map of a
dark, three dimensional cave is
not nearly so easy as finding
our way from Poughkeepsie to

Plattsburg on I-87.

Every comer brings some-
thing new, though. A_ two-foot
passageway often breaks out in-
to a 50-foot room and a rocky
tunnel can lead to a sandy one.
Gilley was noticeably deficient
in. stalacites and stalagmites,
but I was informed that the ease
of passage made up for the lack
of scenery. I took their word
for it.

According to the veterans in
the group, Gilley is one of the
easiest caves around. Most of
your time is spent walking, not
crawling. Even from my unen-
lightened viewpoint I could see
that it was a big cave. Several
rooms were close to 100 feet
high and equally as wide.

Cavers are a rather morbid
lot: you can tell that by noticing
the names of formations on their
maps. Gilley has its Morgue
Room, Slab Room and Sloth of

Competition Kéen For Med School Seats

By JOHN CASSELS

This year 35,000 students will
compete for 13,000 spaces avail-
able in U. S. med schools, and
about 50 Davidson students will
be among the applicants.

According to ‘“‘The Chronicle
of Higher Education,” these 35,-
000 applicants represent an in-
crease of 6,000 applicants over
last year.

The current rise portends an
even greater future demand.
During the last few years there
has been a significant rise in
the number of freshmen and
sophomores enrolled in under-
graduate pre-med programs.

In the last ten years the num-
ber of applications med schools
handle has increased four times,
from 59,054 in 1962-63 to an es-
timated 245,000 this year. Over
this same time period the num-
ber of places in med schools
has increased by only 4500
seats, from 8,642 in 1962-63 to
13,000 im 1972-73.

Davidson continues, however,

to send a majority of its med
school aspirants on to graduate
work. James M. Frederickson,
director of Davidson's pre-med
program, estimates. that 75 per
cent of the college’s applicants
will fill med school seats each
year and that.most of them par-
ticipated in the pre-med pro-
gram at Davidson.

“That percentage would prob-
ably rank us: as number one in
the south and number four in
the country,” Frederickson said.

‘‘We do very well here in the
state medical schools: Duke,
North Carolina, and Bowman-
Gray,” he said. Students also at-
tend state schools throughout
the south and at Pennsylvania,
Baylor, Tulane, Emory, and
Vanderbilt.

“The med schools are looking
for the best student they can
get,” he said. Most any major
can be accepted, as long as the
student has his required sci-
ence. The minimum require-
ments in science for all 108

med schools in the country in-
clude four courses in chemistry
through organic, two courses in
physics, two courses in biology,
and one in math. The Davidson
program is built around this
core, with four additional sci-
ence electives required for a pre-
med major. “‘The pre-med ma-
jor is probably one of the first
inter-disciplinary programs we
(Davidson) have offered,’ Fred-
ericksen said.

The Medical College Admis-
sion Test (Med CAT) is admin-
istered to students applying to
med schools. Frederickson, how-
ever, said that the schools say
it is not the major factor in ad-
mittance. The test covers four
general areas, verbal, quantita-
tive, science, and general knowl-
edge. Davidson students have
done best on the general knowl-
edge section of the test over the
years.

The student who has the bet-
ter background in science might
have some advantage, but extra-

curricular activities and moti-
vation weigh heavily in the
school’s decision.

“Today, it’s not so much the
major you've had, but your po-
tential to be a good physician,”
Frederickson said.

Fewer than a thousand addi-
tional spaces will be available
in first year medical classes.
Although schools in the U. S. are
trying to expand, their rate can-
not keep up with the burgeon-
ing demand for places. More
than 3,000 medical students are
thought to be studying in uni-
versities overseas.

Much of the increase in de-
mand for med school places re-
lates to the demand throughout
the country for more doctors.
Many of the applicants are un-
employed M.A. andPh.D. hold-
ers. Other students with scien-
tific backgrounds have started
going imto medicine since they
feel the field will be more se-
cure in the future than the aero-
space industry.

Crawl On Stomachs
Cave

Despair while other caves are
Man's Torture, No Exit and Pit
noted for such names as Thin
of the Pendulum.

Also, cavers never tell stories
about the outside world, but
they are full of reassuring tales
about doused lights :ad caved
in passages.

Light is definitely the most
important thing to a caver. Car-
bide lamps are treated with the
tenderest of care and we took
enough carbide to last for a
whole day at least.

There is ample justification
for being scared of the dark
when you're 200 feet under-
ground. Once you get into a
cave, you have to get back out,
and to do that you have to have
either light or a whole lot of
luck.

Spelunkers can seldom count
on the latter because of the in-
tricacies of passageways ,so
they make sure they have plen-
ty of the former.

It is really difficult to de-
scribe the feeling you get when
you start out of a cave. Few
structures look the same_ as
they did when you came in.
Therefore, each recognized room
or formation brings a feeling of
relief and each unrecognized
structure brings the id a little
closer to the surface.

It’s a sort of uneasy, anxious
feeling that maybe you'll get
lost. Maybe you'll turn into a
story for other cavers to tell.
But, I guess that's part of the
attraction caving holds: every
time you go in, you don't know
if you’re coming out.

A cloudy, cold, and wet Vir-
ginia sky has never been one of
my favorite sights, but it did
look better than ever Saturday
afternoon. I had been the first
one in, and I was also the first
one out.

Caving is quite an experience,
there’s no question about it, and
{ think I may be ready for an-
other trip in a year or so. Until
then, I ‘think I'll leave caves to
the’bats and bears.
