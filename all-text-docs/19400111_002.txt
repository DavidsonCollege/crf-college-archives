Mthough not many students admit it to
outsiders, there is a bi-semester publica-

tion on the campus that has been

(by those in charge of it) as a humor maga-—{

zine even if te-most—of us—its content is

about as funny as a funeral procession, |
It seems also, that this publication whose |
name is not worthy of type in the David-
sonian, out with sarcastic remarks

about the Davidsonian and then defies us

to uphold them.

comes

Firstly (although we hate to admit it),
the*so-called editor of this humorous maga-
zine is assistant editor of the Davidsonian.
Since he has failed to realize it, we might
mention that his duties are to proof-read
copy for the Davidsonian. He is supposed
to catch the mistakes yet he comes out and
accuses the Davidsonian of having an edi-
torial with four grammatical errors in it. |
It seems to me that the fault is his, net ours, |
that his accusations reflect back to him-

self.

Secondly (sinee the magazine is the only
place where this bard could have his trash
printed), a poem appeared in whicha goat

This poem could very well tell the story
of .the magazine and Davidsonian=if the
magazine doesn’t quit biting off more than
it can chew, it’ll soon be in the same shape
as the goat.

Finally, since the magazine has so un-
justly accused us as it has in the past, let’s
look at the other of the situation

Clemson Did It,
Why Can’t We?

Time has come for the Class of 1940 to
choose a gift which they will present to
the college that their name may not be lost
in the memory of those who shall after-
wards come and go on the Davidson campus.
Clocks, gates,-and fountains dot the campus
today as monuments to the classes who
have passed this way before us. Fine enough
are these things in their’ own monumental
way. And many of them serve well desery-
ed needs, as they should. However, for the
Class of ’40 our ambitions are higher and
greater.

The Davitsontanr——

Thusly, as we cast—about today for a
worthwhile gift to make Davidson’s ath-
letie situation, more specifically football,
attractive opportunity. We
don’t propose, by any means, to say that
we haven't had good, well coached, fight-
ing teams in the past several-years. Da-
vidson has merely been playing football out
of its class. Nevertheless, the Wildcats have
ball and in a
league in which the student body and: the

team: would prefer to compete. However,
the trend today seems to be away from this
league and ffito a lower, order of football.
Therefore, a gift for the Class of 1940 has
been suggested which possibly would slow
down this movement and give us a more
equal footing in the big-time.

The idea brought forward would ask every
member of the class to give ten dollars—
approximately one thousand dollars for the
class—to the formation of a scholarship
fund to be offered to worthy athletes, And

say “worthy athletes” we mean
boys who would ordinarily come to David-
son, pass: their work, and live up to stand-

ships can be done in one of two ways. Either
a committee made up of members of the
class and advised by the Athletic Director
and Head Coach of Football éan make the
choice or it can be left entirely ‘up to the
members_of the coaching staff.

Ten dollars-may sound’a bit stiff, at first
mention, but by the use of various funds on
hand such as the Senior fund collected at
registration andthe damage fee rebates
(if there are any after Monday) the entire
ten will not have to be paid this year. And
who can tell but what some member of oftr
class who may become suddenly rich in the
next several years can contribute enough
to make up for those who cannot pay in
those lean years.

Others may contend that a thousand dol-
lars is not much to offer if it is divided in
many parts, Little that it is, it’s some-
thing and classes after ours may follow the
lead toward building a greater band of fight-
ing Wildcats.

Clemson went to the Cotton Bowl on a
plan similar to this, but on a much ‘larger
scale. Maybe, Davidson could, at least,
beat Carolina.

With such an amposing array of

ion would be that this is a wonder-
ful picture, especially after “Four

going ga-ga. Well, that, surmise
would be correct, but the dope is
that this is not as good as either

It is reported that a small mem-

a mystery story as a good way to
the mind under strain, and

~ternity—chiques;~combines;~or—combinations of
swapping votes. This evil has existed regard-
less. The difference now is that it is done in
an underhand method and it is being tolerated
by the good-natured students of Davidson.

Under the present system, the qualifications
of a man are not brought to the eyes and
ears of the voter. Any “good-fellow” might
be put on the slate by an ambitious fraternity
brother, but his qualifications have to go by
the way of the grapevine. Yet these very
harnessed politicos cause a situation that makes
unfriendliness and hate steam up in the stu-_

| dent. made _ which

Accusations are

n

infractions of the rules, and the sad and dif-
ficult accusations are usually true. It is a
period when feeling and emotions run rampant.
Most of us become poor sports. This is not
typical of Davidson or its students.

In order to make an earnest and sincere at-
tempt to eliminate the situation caused by the
Present system, we heartily endorse ‘the plan,
of “open” politics.

True—combines will be made, fraternity cli-
ques will get a foothold, votes will be solicit-
ed, campaign managers will make speeches,
issue posters, etc.; but IT WILL BE LEGAL.
We will cease to be hypocrits and fools.

Furthermore, for the first time since “closed”
politics gripped the campus, a keen interest
will be aroused in the students. Instdad of
the movies, students will attend open political
meetings for fun and entertainment. Pent
up feelings can be voiced without a summons
before the council. What formerly existed in
the darkened room can be freely discussed in
front of Georgia.

It is not too early to bring the subject up,
because in a very short time the election period
will commence. We must rid ourselves of this
cloak of hypocrisy before it is too late.

Some of the statements made above may
seem daring and untrue. However, the evils
cited are fact and can be proven.

No doubt all of you are wonder-

unusual name of this movie; well,
Balalaika was the name of a cafe
Russia in 1914, and Hona Mas-
sey’s father owns it. Which brings
us to Ilona, who is more interest-
ing to talk about anyway, being as
how she is so stunning and has
such a swell voice. She is teamed

so he disguises himself to get her

year since the advent of big-time,

question

=+-highlypiublicized pigskin _encount-

ers.

It all began with the disastrous
point-a-minute losses-of- the-Chica-
go team, a team that took beating
after beating in Big Ten competi-
tion, much to the chagrin of Ma-

roon fans. The fans, aided and
abetted by sports writers in all
sections of the nation, began the
clamour for alumni funds to aid
in securing hot-shot gridmen. °
Then came the bombshell an-
nouncement of the Chicago board
of trustees, which said in part:
“The university believes /in ath-

letics and in a comprehensive pro-
gram of physical education for all
students. It ‘believes its particular
interests and conditions are such
that its students now derive no
special benefit from intercollegi-
ate football. The university looks
upon all sports as games which
are conducted under its auspices
for the recreation of the students.
The university will continue to pro-
mote intramural sports and will en-
courage all students to participate
in them,” —

With this announcement, Chica-
go authorities cancelled all football
games scheduled for the future and
asked Big Ten authorities to allow
it_to. continue intercollegiate parti-
cipation in the 11 other sports

football so that the “large sums of _
money spent annually on football
can be spent on educational expan-
sion.”

On other fronts, too, subsidiza-_
tion was a large topic of discussion. ~
At a meeting of the College Physi-
cal Education Association, Prof, L.
C. Boles of College of Wooster
urged his colleagues not to allow
coltegiate physical education to be-
come a field for men of “very limit-
ed mental capacity” to continue in
college-forthe sole-purpose-of play-—
ing on teams.

At the University of Pittsburgh,
famed for its great-football-teams
and for its recurring subsidization
debates, Pres. John G. Bowman
asserted that recent sports staff
upheavals at Pitt were made be-
cause “we want most of ‘all that
football be a game for students.
I want to keep the game on a
truly amateur basis here.”

However, simon-pure football is
not receiving the support of all stu-
dents, for at many colleges under-
graduates have begun movements
to subsidize players so that losing
Streaks may be stopped. At the
University of Buffalo, the student
newspaper’ asked the college to
give ten tuition scholarships a year
to men who would be the nucleus”
for winning grid teams. At the
University of Rochester, Pres. Alan
Valentine rejected student demands
for paid players.

There you have the summary of
the great football debate of ’39-’40,
Collegians everywhere are watch-
ing with interest the proposals and
moves intended to solve the prob- ial
lem—and you can bet that the de-
bate is far from settled at the
Present time. You are bound to see
startling developments on the sub-
ject during this year.
