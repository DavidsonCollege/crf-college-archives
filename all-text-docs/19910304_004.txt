Diplomats Address Soviet
Economic and Political Issues

By Laura Malenas

Last Thursday and Friday, Feb.
28 and 29, two Soviet diplomats
visited Davidson to speak on po-
litical and economic issues facing
the Soviet Union. Mr. Andrey
Vasilyev, an attache at the Soviet
Mission to the United Nations spe-
cializing in economic and environ-
mental issues, and Mr. ‘Rashid
Khalikov, the First Secretary at the
Soviet Mission to the UN, ad-
dressed students and faculty on
two different occasions. The first
session was devoted to Soviet
economic reforms. The following
day, Khalikov and Vasilyev spoke
on current political issues in the
Soviet Union.

The two diplomats spoke freely
about the difficult challenges that
their country must face and they
were anxious to answer students’
questions about the deteriorating
Soviet economy.

Vasilyev explained that the
difficulties of transition are somuch
more apparent now because the
whole idea of perestroika is no
longer just a political slogan.
Putting perestrioka into practice is
a painful process. The Soviet par-
liament is now debating how to
promote entrepreneurship in a
country totally unaccustomed to
private ownership and consumer-
goods production. Soviet citizens
have never had to take any eco-
nomic initiative and now the popu-
Jation is resistant to the difficult
changes that perestroika will cause.
Vasilyev even joked that most
Soviets picture fatmen surrounded

tinually made clear that civilians
were not their targets. Maydole
cites the “disputed case” of a
“bunker which housed many civil-
ians, but which the Allies con-
tended was a command and con-
trol facility,” as insufficient evi-
dence to suggest that the Allies
engaged in “indiscriminate” bomb-
ing.
Maydole concludes the argu-
ment documented in his list by
saying that the war in the gulf was
legitimate because its primary end
was to achieve justice.

These points inspired discus-
sion as to the nature of justice as it
relates to one’s perception of

events. Ambassador Jack Perry, .

Director of Davidson’s Dean Rusk
Program in International Studies
added, that in the eyes of most
Americans, “‘the just wars are the
wars we’ve won.” Perry said that
the coaltition forces “went too far
along the way” regarding the

magnitude of force employed. “I .

think we bombed more than we
had to in order to decimate Iraq
instead of protecting our troops,”
he said. :

In regard to post-war relations
with the Arab world, Ellen Ott
pointed to the growth of racistatti-
tudes among Americans as aresult
of the hostilities. She cited, spe-

by bags of money when the ideas
of capitalism and private owner-
ship are mentioned. Resistant or
not, Vasilyev said that even the
most conservative elements of the
populace acknowledge that the old
system of a centralized command
economy does not work. The real
debate is how reforms should be
implemented and how they can be
most effectively reinforced by
political legislation.

To achieve a socialized mar-
ket economy, Vasilyev outlined
some basic principles of economic
reform. These included that all
forms of ownership be protected
through legislation, freedom of
individual and industrial economic
must be encouraged and direct
government ownership must end.
Vasilyev also explained the need
for the Soviet economy to be inte-
grated into the global economy.

During Friday’s discussion of
political issues, Mr. Khalikov
addressed the most urgent issue
facing his country: the future of the
Union. Khalikov explained that
the relationship between the re-
publics, and the central govern-
ment must be defined.

Khalikov expressed his feel-
ing that any republic which wants
to become independent should be
allowed to do so. However, eco-
nomic ties between the republics
and the center make a quick sepa-
ration impossible.

_ ‘Khalikov felt that a civilized
way of divorce should take place
gradually, keeping the interests of
the center and the republic in mind.

warzkopf’s statement that the
people who tortured the Kuwaitis
were notof the same human race as
the rest of us as detrimental to
racial harmony. Anjali Sharma
added that several friends of hers
of Indian descent at other schools
have been mistaken for Iraqis and
harassed.

Economics professor, Dennis
R. Appleyard noted that the United
States was in for a long term com-
mitment towards the rebuilding of
Kuwait which will have a substan-
tial effect upon economic activity
in the US.

Near the end of the discussion,
Dr. William K. Mahony of the
Religion department stated that
Saddam Hussein may very well be
viewed in the Arab world in the
same way that Americans re-
sponded to the protagonist of the
original Rocky film. Mahony stated
that Americans absolutely loved
the Rocky character because, even
though he lost the title fight, he
gambled everything he had inorder
to challenge the world champion.
Saddam, Mahony claimed, may be
seen in a similar light by the Iraqi
people. .

The discussion closed with a
expression of hope on the part of
many participants that the actions
in the Gulf will help to promote a
lasting peace. Of particular sig-
nificance to the group was the
United Nations’ approval of the

To avoid civil war, Khalikov
stressed peaceful, constructive
dialogue to achieve some type of
union or toachieve separation, with
all negative consequences mini-
mized.

Khalikov felt that Lithuania
and Georgia, the states with the
strongest independence move-
ments, were heading towardsacon-
frontation that could only develop
into civil war. Khalikov expressed
his feeling that the militant push
for independence by these two
republics was not helping their
cause. The Soviets believe that
still more time is needed to work
out an adequate compromise.

Khalikov was also confident
that Mikhail Gorbachev will be
leading the transition of the coun-
try from the old Soviet Union to a
newly defined federation.
Khalikov explained that Gor-
bachev’s potential has not been
exhausted and that he has no rival
that equals his leadership ability.
Gorbachev still seems the best
choice for the future.

The excellent relationship be-
tween Gorbachev and President
Bush also adds to Gorbachev’s
power. The war in the Persian
Gulf only strengthened the rela-
tionship between the two leaders
and increased their confidence in
each other. Khalikov pointed out
how now our two countries can
work harmoniously toward com-
mon goals. ‘Together the Soviets
and the Americans can create and
preserve a peaceful new world
order.

this consultation of the U.N. will
set a positive historical precedent.
After the discussion, keynote
speaker Khaled Al Koor, a 1987
Davidson alumnus, told the group
about his experiences in Kuwait at
the time of the original Iraqi inva-
sion last August. In his remarks he
touched on several issues raised
during theconference, specifically
the position of Palestinians in
Kuwait. His comments added a
more realistic dimension to the
conference, as he depicted, first
hand, the events of the invasion.
