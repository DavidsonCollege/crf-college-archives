Dean Polls
Students
On Booze

Eighty-six percent of the
student body favors en-
forcement of a systemtic
modification of the present
campus drinking rules, ac-
cording to a survey taken
by the Dean of Students Of-
fice.

The survey. which had a re-
sponse from 139 of the 198 stu-
dents polled, sought reliable in-
formation on student opinion.
according to Robert Jones, as-
sistant dean of students.

This survey, Jones said. is
more accurate than an earlier
one administered by the Stu-
dent Council at the fraternity
houses, because it has a more
random sample.

“The basic objection of stu-
dents to the drinking rule of
the student body regulations,"
Jones commented, as he inter-
preted the statistics and addi-
tional student comments. ‘‘was
the nature of enforcement. The
feeling was that enforcement
has been arbitrary in the past.”

Lax enforcement, Jones con-
tinued, “has in reality encour-
aged the possession of alcohol
on campus and this was gener-
ally known among the student
body." He also indicated that
the students would be ‘more
comfortable’ if the rules and
common practice were recon-
ciled.

Response to the questionnaire
came from 27 seniors, 30 jun-
iors, 39 sophomores, 42 fresh-
men and one “other” student.
Fraternity membership of the
sample totaled 78 per cent.

Out of an average of 62 per
cent of students drinking. 45
per cent of freshmen. 65 per
cent of sophomores, 70 per cent
of juniors. and 74 per cent of
seniors indicated that they drink.
Fifty per cent had drunk be-
fore entering Davidson.

While 68 per cent did not op-
pose drinking or possession of
alcohol on campus, 72 per cent,
opposed the drinking or posses-
sion of alcoholic liquors by stu-
dents in the dorms. Only 19 per
cent opposed the use of alco-
hol by Davidson students ‘‘as a
matter of principle.”

Although 48 per cent did not
favor the possession or use of
alcohol in the fraternity houses.
72 per cent opposed a complete-
ly “dry” campis. Fifty-four per
cent admitted that their parents,
51 per cent of whom drink. fa-
vored a completely ‘‘dry’’ cam-
pus, in their opinion.

Regarding enforcement of the
drinking rules. 57 per cent felt
the Student Council and Honor
Court have ‘‘the main responsi-
bility for enforcing the student
regulations." However, 74 per
cent preferred that “the stu-
dent body not have regulations
on drinking and leave enforce-
ment of college policy up to the
faculty and administration.”

Trunk Rule Change
Proposed By Students

Regulations on the search of automobiles were modified by the faculty Tuesday
after several weeks of study on the campus drinking problem.

The new rule, which replaces
item 12 of the faculty regula-
tiens on the use of motor ve-
hicles, states im part that
“trunks of vehicles on campus
will not be searched nor juris-
diction claimed without prior
authorization for the search of
a specified vehicle by the Honor
Court, the Student Council. or
the Executive Committee of the
Faculty.”

Acting to bring the student
body regulations into agreement
with the revised faculty stand,
the student council on Wednes-

day night voted to propose to

the student body an amendment
to the Student Body Constitution.

The proposed amendment is
the same as the new rule the

faculty passed on Tuesday, ex-
cept on Tusday, except that the
words, “for a specified viola-
tion,” are inserted after the
phrase. ‘‘search of a. specified
vehicle,” and before the phrase,
“by the Honor Court... .”

The council also passed a
declaration of policy which em-
phasized its intention to ‘‘earn-
estly support and enforce the
provisions of Section 2. Article
VIII of the Student Body Con-
stitution.”

Student Body President Will
Jackson explained that the
policy declaration “isin line
with the Student Council's be-
lief that the student body does
not want to allow liquor in the

Committee Appointed
For Fraternity Study

By JAMIE BRYANT
Davidsonian Staff Writer
The Student Council com-

mittee drawn up to study
the fraternity system as
well as the total social life
at Davidson is “not stacked
for the status quo,” and will
approach the matter with
an open mind and a con-
structive attitude, according
to Student Body President

Will Jackson.
The inclusion of Bob Young.

Bob Jones. and Will Terry on
the committee will not neces-
sarily be a negative influence
in the committee’s report. The
committee {s composed of Jack-
son, as chairman; Rick Von Un-
werth, Bill Council. Ed Hasel-
den and Art Ross with frater-
nity affiliations; Pat Fisher and
Rufus Hallmark for the Inde-
pendents; Young. Jones. and
Terry representing the faculty
and administration.

At Its first meeting Thursday,
deferred rush. 100 per cent bid-
ding. and the school’s responsi-
bility to the Independents with
regard to social facilities on
campus were specific subjects
assigned to the committee's
three ‘subcommittees. The sub-
committees will report back to
the entire committee which will

then submit its final report to
the Student Council. The Coun-
cil will then make recommen-
dations to the Faculty Commit-
tee on Fraternities, Clubs, and
Social Life.

The subcommittees will com-
pile their information through
correspondence with other
schools—including Southwestern.
Sewanee. Florida Presbyterian,
Amherst, and Princeton—as well
as through the NSA _ Student
Government Information Serv-
ice and personal contacts.

The committee's initial meet-
ing on Thursday was an organi-
zational meeting, to make plans
for and to outline objectives of
the study which must meet a
March 1 deadline. The study
will have the same effect is any
regular committee report. and
will be available for reference.
Council will limit its actiong to
making recommendations to the
faculty. Jackson said.

The study is an evaluation of
the social life at Davidson at-
tempted on a broad scale to
point out deficiencies and pos-
sible corrective action. The
composition of the .committee
itself is planned to afford an
unbiased, open-minded apprais-
al.

NSA Representatives
Review Recent Meeting

“Since the stuff was run by larger schools, very. little of the program was really
relevant at Davidson,” began Bill Council as he presented his report on the NSA
regional to the Student Council Monday night.

Council's fellow delegate.
Chuck Matthews, expressed a
similar opinion, remarking that
the material presented at vari-
ous seminars during the con-
vention would “be of more help
to the Davidson YMCA than
the student government.”

When asked after their report
if they could point to any par-
ticular benefits that Davidson
might derive from such a meet-
ing, Matthews pointed to the
NSA’s reduced-rate student trav-
el program. remarking that sev-
eral “good déals’ were avail-
able to all students through this
program. He said that under
this plan a student might fly to
Europe for as little as $250, or
stay in any Hilton Hotel in the
country for $4 a night.

In response to the same ques-
tion. Council observed that “ne
can really get a lot out of such
a meeting. through associations
with other delegates and such.”
He termed it a “very valuable
experience.”

During his report, Matt} 2ws
told of a motion made by nc
State delegates which suggest-
ed the removal of 2 reference

to God found in the preamble of
the new constitution. “The mo-
tion was defeated 17 to four,”
he continued. ‘those four votes
coming from the State dele-
gates. Upon defeat of their mo-
tion. the State delegates walked
out of the meeting.”

In an amusing climax to the
meeting, David Walker moved
that the council support the
regional NSA's vote to keep
“God” in the preamble of their
constitution. Johnny Gresham
seconded the motion. After a
brief discussion, the council de-
feated the proposal supporting
God with only two assenting
votes.

In other business. Bill Coun-
cil reported that Dr. Tom Scott,
athletic director at Davidson.
“was surprisingly receptive to
the idea of keeping the gym
open of evenings for student
use.”

In a report to the Student
Council on his efforts to secure
permission for this plan, Coun-
cil said that the gym would be
open every evening possible for
four and one-half hours for all
sports except swimming. Scott

eral Charlotte clothing stores

ing to David Meschan.

In his report to the council
on his project he said that little
interest had been shown in the
plan by most of the Stores ap-
proached thus far, but he ex-
pressed the hope that he might
find success in obtaining dis-
counts at movie theaters.

David Powell told the council
that the parking area behind
Chambers Building was now

available to students during the

hours posted. He further. ex-
pressed concern over the lack
of a signal at the railroad cross-
ing on Griffith Street, saying
that he nearly had an accident
there late one night. as he was
unable to see a train moving
across the road.

Johnny Gresham volunteered
to look into the possibility of

dormitories or the fraternity
houses, or drinking anywhere
on the campus itself. .

“We are willing to actively
enforce a drinking rule with
respect to these areas where it
is—and should be—both realistic
and enforceable.”

Commenting on the’ revision
of the faculty regulations, Presi-
dent D. Grier Martin stated, “It
is my belief that (the jurisdic-
tion of the new rule) will not be
used to. search for alcoho) in
trunks of cars, but this is the
only exemption from search on
campus.

“It is not intended that it will
be used indiscriminately to
check on whatever a student has
in his trunk,’ explained Mar-
tin, ‘but this prevents it from
being impossible for the three
bodies. named in the rule, to
examine trunks of cars in situ-
ations which are serious or
dangerous to the college com-
munity.

The actions by the faculty and
the council came following dis-
cussions of the drinking issue
which began jin October. A pe-
tition for changes in.the drink-
ing regulations was presented to
the council then after an incl-
dent involving these regulations,
and thereafter the council work-
ed actively to change them.

The Student-Faculty Confer-
ence Committee discussed the
apparent increase in the amount
of drinking on campus and pos-
sible solutions to the problem.

Embry Will
PushStudy
Overseas

Prof. Joe O. Embry, chair-
man of the Faculty Foreign
Study Committee. will- address
the student body during Mon-
day’s chapel period. Embry
hopes “‘to make Davidson stu-
dents aware of the opportuni-
ties available for foreign study
and travel.

“Often students wait too long
before beginning to make plans.
and early preparation is essen-
tial for many of these pro-
grams.”'

“There are numerous pro-
grams available in addition to
the Davidson Foreign Plan,”
commented Embry. He pointed
out that the College is a mem-
ber of the Council on Student
Travel, which. offers students
unusually economical means for
summer travel overseas.

The possibilities for expan-
sion of Davidson's own program
appear to be great. With suffi-
cient student interest. a year
of study in Latin America may
be made available.

Looking further into the fu-
ture, Embry spoke of the possi-
bility of a study program in
Asia.

WILL
JACKSON

19, student leaders Will Jack-
son. Fred Sackett. and Charlie
Dibble presented a proposal
for changing the drinking regula-
tions so that the trunks of auto-
moblies would not be considered
‘on campus’. They felt that
this would allow for a more
“systematic” enforcement of the
rule.

Action on this proposal, as
well as an alternative one pre-
sented by the Executive Com-
mittee of the faculty, was de-
layed until the monthly faculty
meeting Tuesday, when the
faculty adopted their new rule in

Jackson Aims To Kill
Council’s Proposal

By BOB VANCE
Davidsonian Statf Writer
Student Body President Will

Jackson has decided to call for
the rejection of the present
amendment to the drinking rule
which is pending before the stu
dent body in order that a clear.
er and more precisely-worded
clause with a new definition of
‘tcampus” be adopted.

The new, tentatively pro-
posed amendment would be
added at the end of Section 2,
Article VII of the Student
Body Constitution and would
read as follows: ‘‘For the pur-
pose of enforcing this regu-
lation with specific regard to
the possession of alcoholic 1i-
quors, the trunks of automo-

the term ‘campus’.”

The decision to ask the. stu-
dent body to reject the amend-
ment presented in assembly
Thursday was made as a result
of its apparent ambiguity and
possible misinterpretation.

At the special meeting of -the
Student Council Wednesday eve-
ning, Fred Sackett, president of
the Senior Class, moved that
the following clause be proposed
to the student VWody as an
amendment to the Student Body
Constitution:

“Trunks of vehicles on cam-
pus will not be searched nor
jurisdiction claimed without pri-
or authorization for the search
of a specified vehicle by the
Honor Court, the Student Coun-

biles shall not be covered by cil. or the Executive Committee

JEFFERSONIAN EDUCATION

Malone TalksinChapel

By BOB STRAUSER
Davidsonian Feature Editor

Dr. Dumas Malonc. professor
of history at the University of
Virginia, appeared on campus
the latter half of this week. Phi
Beta Kappa Lecturer for 1964,
Dr. Malone delivered several
addresses in his two-day stay.

In Thursday assembly, the vis-
iting lecturer, who is writing a
five-volume biography of Thom-
as Jefferson. spoke on ‘Mr.
Jefferson’s Education.”

Malone noted that he had
never been asked to appear at
Davidson before and “would
make the most” of his oppor-
tunity. With telling authority,
he proceeded. “Jefferson didn’t
come to Davidson either; .. .
of course, he died 12 years ‘be-
fore the college was founded.”
’ Jefferson. the biographer not-
ed, attended William and Mary

| when that institution had 50-100

students. ‘In his lifetimefi” said
Malone, ‘‘he had six teachers
and three of those were remark-
able men.”

As a young student. Jefferson
had a love of the classics and
of language study instilled in
him. Aside from the classical
languages, he could read end

ish.

Said the visilor, ‘“Jefferson’s
career, as much as any man’s,
was based on his ability to
write. He would be remembered
for this alone.”

At William and Mary, William
Small introduced the future
President to science. Malone
noted, ‘There was no conflict
for Jefferson between humanism
and science; that’s the way it
ought t» be."" The speaker ven-
tured further, “I won't say
more since I don't understand
science.''

“The pursuit of knowledge,”
Jefferson was quoted as saying.
“is an infinite delight.’

Malone was asked in coffee
hour about his personal pursuit
of knowledge: .

“My work in. biography.” he
replied. ‘‘gives the reader the
opportunity to enlarge his ex-
to profit from
the mistakes and successes of
others."

Questioned about the place of
the intellectual in modern poli-
tics, he noted that it was not
always helpful. as in the case
of Adlai Stevenson. Particularly
at. the local level, an intellect
is often distrusted in politics.

On a related subject .Malone
pointed out that Harry Truman
and John Kennedy were good
historians; Roosevelt, Eisenhow-
er and Hoover were not. *‘Cal
Coolidge did not kriow it ex-
isted.”

In summary, Malone was ask-
ed to rank Jefferson as a Presi-
dent.

He replied. ‘Jefferson was
trying to make democratic self-
government work at a_ time
when no such thing existed any-
where else in the world. and he
succeeded. For this he must be
ranked high.”

The motion was amended to
read ‘*. . . for the search of a
specified vehicle for a speci-
fied violation...”

Lengthy discussion followed
concerning the ‘‘ambiguities” in
the wording of the motion. Stu-
dent Body President Will Jack-
son supported the Sackett mo-
tion as amended.

Charles Dibble. editor of THE
DAVIDSONIAN, took issue. (Al-
though not a member of Coun-
cil, Dibble along with Jackson
and Sackett had appeared be-
fore the Faculty to request that
the Faculty alter its concept of
trunks.) He contended that. if
the motion as worded were plac-
ed in the Student Body Consti-
tution. Council and Honor Court
members would still be honor-
bound to enforce the prohibition
against alcoholic beverages in
trunks.

He asked that,the Sackett
motion be defeated and that the

‘DEADEST PLACE I’VE BEEN’

——

Dugan Blasts Davidson Mood

By CHARLES VICK
Davidsonian Reviewer

Pulitzer Prize winner Al-
an Dugan was quite percep-
tive. “This is the deadest
place I've been on_ this
tour.” His poetry was good
too. The people who came
to hear him were few, but
that is not too unusual. Per-

haps it is the greatest com-.

pliment the student can be-

stow.
Dugan talked about attitudes

toward poetry after he had read
certain of his poems. Dugan is

tall, lanky and friendly. He did .

not seem to really mind the
poor reception.

“A lot of people are just
ashamed of poetry: they think
it is fairy.’ One professor’s wife
commented that there was a lot
of interest in poetry on campus,
but that it just had no point of
expression. no outlet. Writing
might be a nice outlet.

The thing that Dugan is prais- -

ed for is being an American
poet. He writes in the language
Americans speak and he well
presents its beauty.

In commenting on his use of
obscenities, Dugan noted that
some used it to shock readers,
to seem contemporary. “I use
obscenities in poems as they’re
used. It is part of our language.”

‘Perhaps the most appealing
thing about Dugan was his ex-
planation of method. He did not
become concerned with iam-
bics or metrics. “I just write

and let: the line fall into place.”

This is not just easy talent.
He keeps poems in his note-
books up to 10 years. revising
and rewriting. To another ques-
tion he said that this falling of
line into place is a process of
the poet's own particular syn-
tax. .

Asked what his poems are

about he simuly said. ‘‘the way

it is." He writes ‘about back
yards and city bums and war
buddies and masturbation. He
just says. ‘‘this is the way it
is’. There are books of his po-
etry available in the book store
and. they are worth the money.

Before the evening was over
a story was related about Carl
Sandberg’s one word distinction
between prose and poetry, ‘‘wat-
tage.” This was explained as

meaning that a poem gives off
heat and light because of its
unique construction.

Dugan was asked to agree or
disagree, and he said, ‘‘the dif-
ference is verse.’ And that is
the way it is.

Dugan was not wild or beat or
communistic. He was simply ex-
traordinary without the aid of
affectation and that is an un-
usual thing.
