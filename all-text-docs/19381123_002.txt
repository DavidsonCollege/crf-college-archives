Friday, November 18, should surely be

marked as.aégreat day in the history of
Davidson, for on that day a new spirit of

Dr. Lingle began the day by appealing to

Then the student body met to hear. the

composed of both faculty and student lead-

place on the Davidson campus, for through
its operation may come recommendations
for modification of and addition to the pres-

claim as ourcalma mater and to which our
cherished sons may come in due time.
Strangely, the proposal comes as an answer
of approval to Dr. Lingle’s appeal.

There comes with such things an obliga-

men—will hardly fail to meet. That is the
obligation to hold the good of Davidson—

Editorial “We”

There is an old expression among news-
paper men that the fondness for the ex-
pression “we” in editorial use arises from
a need of intimidating irate readers who
might be afraid of tackling more than one
editor.

The editor reads and.talks and listens

to countless expressions of ideas. He may
seam a dozen exchanges commenting upon
some news of the day, and talk to a dozen
more persons about it. He gets letters and
hears radio commentators. And then when
he gets around to writing a piece of his own
hisemind is a jumble of many contributions.
Very little of what he produces is his own,
except the arrangement.

Consequently when the editor writes “we,”

also he may be paying unconscious homage

Because if we become too impressed with
our own brilliance, we may cease to place
