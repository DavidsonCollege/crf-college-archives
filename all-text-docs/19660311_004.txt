Vespers
Changes
Proposed

A number of sweeping changes
in the Vespers program will be
presented to the Religious Life
Committee Monday.

The changes include proposals
that Vespers be held every other
week, that Vespers and chapel
cuts be combined and that no
credit be given for morning wor-
ship attendance.

Smith. student members of the
committee, are sponsoring the

describe what. seems to be going
on next year—mostly with photo-
graphs and few words,

We aren't just now anti-any-
thing and deny the idea of a
metaphysic for an annual, which
here means that we don’t even
try to know why there should be
an annual publication anyway.

There will be pictures of
cracks in walls and bald heads
and people getting brownie
points, if we can manage.

cess, but it will be about David

on having local speakers, rather
than outside preachers.

“There are several advantages,
to this.’ Smith told THE DAVID.
SONIAN. ‘Having only local
speakers gives more control over
the speakers’ topics. and a uni-
fied theme for a year can be!
worked out.”

, The proposals have been en-
dorsed by the YMCA Cabinet.

‘We are real optimistic about
the chances for this proposal.”
Smith said. ‘We've talked to all
the faculty members on the com-.
mittee. and they were generally
pretty receptive to the idea.”

Smith emphasized that the so-
lution was by :no means per-.
fect, but urged students to re-
member that ‘we're working
within certain limitations and
we've got to work in: these boun-
daries.”

“We feel that this is better
than the present solution.’ he!
said.

composed of the pastor of the
College Church, a representative
of the Department of Bible and
Religion and a representative of
students chosen from the Y
Cabinet.

Services would be conducted
by students and faculty together.

One of the recommended po-
licies encourages ‘faculty mem-
bers to include college Vespers
in their regular schedule of wor-
ship."

“This is one of the important
aspects of the change.’’ Smith
said. ‘We're trying to get back
to the idea of corporate wor-
ship.”

John Sousa Concert

The Davidson College Wind
Ensemble will present a John

in Hodson Hall next Friday night
to raise funds for the Sousa sec-
tion of the new National Cultural
Center in Washington, D.C.

Beginning at 8:15 p.m., the
concett will feature many of
Sousa’s immortal works includ-
ing the ever popular ‘Stars and
Stripes Forever.” Other works
to be heard will be Tchaikov-
sky's ‘Finale’ to the Fourth
Symphony, ‘Pictures at an Ex-

A highlight of the concert,
directed by Grier M. Williams,
will be duets featuring the En-

quality as a vehicle for the pub-
lication of work by students and
persons related to this college.
The second issue of the Miscel-
lany is to be out late this month.
In accord with the stated prin-
ciple, it will contain three of four
short stories, several essays,
poetry, an interview with Steph-
en Spender, two reviews and
color prints of Herb Jackson's
paintings along with several of
his poems. This will amount to
clase to one hundred pages.

, Two criticisms haye  been-
raised: (1) shortage of student
contributions, and (2) no humor.
| First our policy is that the stu-
dents contribute and that the
staff edit. More and more stu-
dents are contributing. and we
are beginning to develop the
backlog of material which is es-
sential to consistent quality.
Secondly, no humor has been
contributed. The magazine which
the Miscellany replaced assigned
assigned staff members to write
humor and borrow cartoons, pro-
ducing a publication of doubtful
value. The staff, if it is to do

it's primary job properly, can-|

not be burdened with writing as-
signments. Even beyond that

good humor is difficult to write.
as Puneh’s editor pointed out.
The Miscellany would print good
humor if it were to be contri-
buted.

In running for re-election as
editor, I can only say that liter-

‘MISCELLANY’

ary quality and flexibility of for-
mat would remain the central
tenets of the editorial policy. Stu-
denis contributions would still
constitute the matter of the mag-
azine. I feel that it is this policy
coupled with the editorial elec-
tion that definitely makes the
Miscellany the student’s mag-
azine. The material would not
be limited to staff assignments
or to specific literary or pictor-
ial forms. This magazine is do-
ing a job for the college and for
the students. It is important that
this, Davidson’s only literary
outlet, grow and develop. The
Miscellany has already been a
participant in two national ex-
hibits and has received favorable
critical comments from _ these
and other soutces, magazines,
professors, and students from
this and other colleges. I would
certainly appreciate the chance
to continue with the growth and
development of the Miscellany
this one more year.

Th Davidson debate team was
defeated in two tournaments this
past weekend, a varsity meet at
Duke and a novice meet at

Davidson sent two teams to
each tournament, with Greg
Haynes, Tom Rhodes, Mike
Mooty and Tom Earnhardt com-
posing: the varsity teams and
Fletcher Hartsell, Charles Eakes
Jim Cooley and Shep Johnston
constituting the novice teams.

At Duke, the team of Rhodes
and Haynes finished ‘with a re-
cord of 3-3, as did the team of
Mooty and Earnhardt. However,
both teams lost speaker points
and failed to place.

We feel that the present maga-
zine does not properly represent
the Davidson Student Body. Stu-
dent contributions have been too
few, and have not been of the
quality of which Davidson stu-
dents are capable. The material
in The Miscellany has been too
“arty’’ and definitely does not
teflect campus interests.

We feel that students find it
hard to identify with Jiterature

faculty members and _ transla-
tions of foreign poetry. Literary

Debate Team Defeated

Johnston were 3-3, while Hartsell
and Eakes were 5-1. The score
equalled that of the winners, but
the team again lost speaker
points and failed to qualify.
Coach Ray McMillin cites lack
of experience as the main rea-
son that Davidson has won only
one trophy this year, a third
place at the University of Geor-
gia Tournament. He also pointed
to limited library facilities as a
factor in the lack of success.

talent, both serious and satirical,
is present on campus, but it has
not been represented in the pre-
sent magazine.

At a liberal arts college such
talent should be provided with a
proper outlet other than English
assignments. Thus, we need .a
student-oriented publication, and
the present magazine is not
meeting this need.

We would propose a re-em-
phasis on student literary effort
and on student satire. The pub-
lication should be expanded to
three issues, two of which re-
present good original humor and
the other serving as a review
of serious literary works, such
as poetry and short stories.

To facilitate the collection and
assembling of material, we
would set up a permanent writ-
ing staff given definite writing
assignments. This staff would be
divided into literary and satirical
departments, each headed by an
assistant editor and responsible
for its respective issues.

Each issue would contain re-
views of items of student interest
such as books, plays, music,
comic books. [licks at the Fox,
the ‘World 500," etc. The crea-
tive effort of any student would
be welcomed. This, coupled with
the assigned work. of the writing
staff, would provide the neces-
sary material for three good is-
sues.

We intend to produce a pub-
lication by members of the
Davidson academic community
and reflective of its tastes and
interests.

WAKE ME WHEN IT’S OVER

The trouble with early morning classes is that you're too

sleepy. At late morning classes you're too hungry. At early
afternoon classes you’re too logy. At late afternoon classes
you're too hungry again. The fact is—and we might as well
face it—there is no good time of day to take a class.

What shall we do then? Abandon our colleges to the ivy?
I say no! I say America did not become the hope of man-
kind and the world’s largest producer of butterfats and tal-
low by running away froma fight!

If you’re always too hungry or too sleepy for class, then
let’s hold classes when you're not too hungry or sleepy:
namely, while you're eating or sleeping.

Classes while eating are a simple matter. Just have a lec-
turer lecture while the eaters eat. But watch out for noisy
foods. I mean who can hear a lecturer lecture when every-
body is crunching celery or matzo or like that? Serve quiet
stuff—like anchovy paste on a doughnut, or steaming bowls
of lamb fat. b

ow let us turn to the problem of learning while slee
ing. First, can it be done? 8 a
es, it can. Psychologists have proved that the brain is
definitely able to assimilate information during sleep. Take,
for instance, a recent experiment conducted by a leading
Eastern university (Stanford). A small tape recorder was
laced under the pillow of the subject, a freshman named
robert Wright. When Wrobert was fast asleep, the re-
corder was turned on. Softly, all through the night, it re-

peated three statements in Wrobert’s slumbering ear:

1. Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 109 and is called
“The Founder of English Eclectic Philosophy.”

h 2. The banana plant is not a tree but a large perennial

erb.

8. The Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in 1914 at
Sarajevo by a young nationalist named Miilas Cvetnic,
who

been ealled “The Trigger of World War I.”

’ the morning, the psychologists
said to him, “Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 109. t
is he called?”

Wrobert promptly answered, ‘‘Perennial Herb.”

Next, they asked him, “What has Miilas Cvetnik been
calle

Wrobert replied, “Perennial Serb.”

Finally they said, “Is the banana plant a tree?”

“To be honest,” said Wrobert, “I don’t know too much
about bananas. But if you gents want any information
about razor blades, I'm a tron '

“Well,” said the psycholo » “can you tell us a blade
that shaves closely and cleanly without nicking, pricking,
scratching, scraping, scoring, gouging, grinding, flaying or

i

“Yes, I can,” said Wrobert. “Personna® Stainless Steel
Blades. Not only does Personna give you a true luxury
shave, but it gives you heaps and gobs and bushels and
barrels of true luxury shaves—each one nearly as truly lux-
urious as the first.”

“‘Land’s sake!” said the psychologists.

“Moreover,” said Wrobert, ‘‘Personna is available not
only in the Double Edge style blade, but also in the Injec-
tor style blade.”

“Great balls of fire!’ said the psychologists.

“So why don’t you rush to your dealer and get some
Personnas at once?” said Wrobert.

_ “We will,” said the psychologists, twinkling, “but there
is something we have to do first.”

Whereupon they awarded Wrobert an honorary L.L.B.
{Lover of Luxury Blades) degree, and then, linking arms,
they sang and danced and bobbed for apples till the camp-
fire had turned to embers.

*@ @ 1006, Afex Shuiman
if you’re looking for an honorary degree yourself, we recome
mend B.S. (Burma Shave®)—from the makers of Personna,
it soaks rings around any other lather; it comes in regular or
menthol.
