tual and moral values are
concerned, his dedication and
commitment to the ideals of
Davidson have often been an
inspiration to each of us. He is a
man you can go to with both
your academic and personal
problems. He has been a point
of sensibility and strength in an
otherwise fluctuating situation
for Sociology majors. His inter-
est and dedication to-the com-
munity at large are well known.
He has devoted an enormous
amount of time to the. cross-
country team, as well as to the
Lion's Club and the Wildcat
Club. He has also been involved
in numerous campus activities
and has always been, available

or groups. One sort of wonders
what we'll do without him.

We do not pretend to be able

to assess the relative merits of a
professor’s professional attain-
ments, but we do know that Dr.
Koller, along with Dr. Retzer,
presented a paper at a profes-
sional meeting earlier this year
which was very well received,
and that he has submitted
papers to the faculty research
group,-in which he was an
active member. —

. Another point which may be
best treated under professional
attainments is the importance
of Dr. Koller to the Sociology
department. The department
has been in a constant state of
flux during our time here, with
Dr. Koller the only real point of
stability. For much of the time
we have not had a full depart-
ment chairman, and the con-

stant hope of finding new
personnel has kept. us all in a
sort of confusion about what
will happen to our majors. The
explanation given to us of
working for the good of the

department in the long run is.

not satisfactory. Furthermore,
we feel that in the short run it is
a virtual disaster. Dr. Koller is
the principle reason many of us
joined the department in the
first place, as evidenced by the
low number of junior majors,
who unlike the senior majors,
had time to get out of the major
after hearing about the deci-
four junior majors, counting
one in the fourth year of a five
year program. Dr. Koller’s im-
portance is further underscored
by the current head of the
department, who has assured us
of his vehement protests.
Though we are not attempting
to derogate any new faculty
which has been or may be hired
to replace Dr. Koller, we feel
that it will be almost impossible
to find a single individual to fill
this enormous gap.

Beyond the incorrectness of

‘the decision in Dr. Koller’s case,

we would like to address our-
selves to the broader problem of
the evaluation procedure itself.
The situation has become so
unclear as to give those with
paranoid tendencies. a belief in
an evil conspiracy. Though we
are certainly not subscribing to
this notion, there do seem to be
some very disconcerting discre-
pancies.

Foremost is the question of
periodic evaluations. You have

stated that there was no system
of evaluation in service for those
considered for tenure in 1979. In
fact, you have stated that these
evaluations ‘*...have not been
considered essential. ” Yet the
coliege supposedly subscribes
to the American Association of
University Professors’ guide-
lines which plainly state the
decision ‘*...must be based on a
continuous evaluation process,
during which the probationary
candidate is regularly informed
formance and his prospects.”
We applaud the institution of
regular faculty evaluations by
Dean Zimmerman, but they
were simply not supplied to the
aforementioned candidates of
last year. Admittedly, the

shifts in the Dean of the

Faculty position in the last few

years havecaused some confu-
sion, but rather than a reason
for denying tenure, this should
have been cause for the gran-
ting of grater consideration to
those who were not able to
benefit from a consistent and
stable policy. If Davidson’s
commitments have changed,
then that should be stated,
nevertheless one should not
**,..change the rules in the
middle of the game,’ as Dr.
Retzer said. It is patently
unjust to evaluate someone
under criteria of which he or she
has no knowledge.

In the absence of any struc-
tured evaluation procedure, the
professors involved had to at-
tempt to diagnose their position
by the means they had avail-
able. The fact that they were

given contract renewals and
substantial raises contributed
to their feelings of security.
There seems to be some confu-
sion over this. issue. You re-
cently stated that “A contract
renewal isnot a tenure deci-
sion.” ’ Yet when it was noted
that the last tenure refusal was

in 1973 you pointed out that a
number of people had been

refused contract renewal and
at an earlier .”" Some

problem is that there was

nothing else for these people to
feed- .

utilize as
back for personal evaluation.
All of the feedback Dr. Koller
received from students and
faculty was appasnlly peaiti

The degree of student support

was evidenced by: iast year's
petitions, in which approxi
mately 700 student evinced

their displeasure with the deci-.

son onl Weer
on one petition, and ‘nearly

500 signed their direct support —

of Dr. Koller on another. This
was in spite of the timing of the
issue of the Davidsonian and
during the week before exams.

Another point: of contention
is the explanation of the deci-
sion to the professors involved.
You have said that those who

question their decision would be

granted a chance to discuss the
case with the Dean of the
Faculty. However, Dr. Zimmer-
man, in speaking of these
impending meetings, stated

ian and the halls of Cham-
bers. Something must be done.
We-come to you as Sociology
majors because we feel that this
gives us some measure of extra
insight into the situation. Thus,
on the basis of the above-
mentioned facts, we respect-
fully submit our request for
reconsideration of tenure denial
to Dr. Koller, as well as
clarification of the tenure proce-
dures, both as they have been
and will be followed.
