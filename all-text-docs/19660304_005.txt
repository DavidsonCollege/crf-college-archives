THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE FIVE

AN INTERVIEW WITH DRIESELL

The burgundy and biack speckled carpet was
littered with letters and newspaper clippings singing
praises to as yet unknown high school stars.

Coach Lefty Driesell was on his hands and knees
poring over the press releases, papers and hastily
penned letters that praised prospective players

Slowly he pulled himself up and prepared
umpteenth interview since his Wildcats van
quished West Virginia to take the Southern Conter
Tournament.

Resigned to his fate. Driesell began answering
ques rn he’ d heard for a week with a slight edge
in his voice that revealed both the pressure he felt
from the coming NCAA tournament and his impa-
tience with a necessary evil, the press.

“Why this year? Well there were several f
We didn’t have the pressure of being national ty r ilk:
ed. We were in better psychological condition. You
know, all those things I’ve said before.”

Still on edge, Driesell refused to compare this
year’s team with past years’ squads. “I don’t compare
teams. I've had great teams in the past; this is a great
team.

“I’ve never coached a team with dissension
among the players; last year I had a team—I mean
they played as a team, not individuals.

“And this year we’ve got a team with five men
on the court. We aren’t a one-man team by any
means.”

It is this year’ s team that deserves the spotlight.
It is this year’s team that has earned Driese]] one of
the sweetest victories he has had.

“This was a big win; maybe not the biggest, but
it was good for the boys, for Davidson.

“I’m real proud of these boys. They worked hard
for this victory, and they got it with six sophomores
on the team. They couldn’t have done what they did
without 100 per cent effort.”

After his practiced tournament remarks, Drie-
sell began a series of observations on the NCAA East
ern Regionals, the mountain of pressure he faces be-
ginning next week. Ironically he was more relaxed.

“Coach Mitchell and I both went up to see the
Rhode Island-Connecticut game. Both have good
teams. Rhode Island is a run and shoot team, explo
sive. Connecticut isn’t like this, but they’ve won
something like 10 of the last 11 Yankee Conference
crowns. I think, I don’t know for sure.”

Tonight Rhode Island travels to Connecticut's
home court to play-off with the UConns for the Yan
kee title. Connecticut got the home court by the flip
of a coin after they beat Rhode Island earlier this
week (on the same home court) to force a title play
off.

Once past their Philadelphia opponent the ‘Cats
would travel to Raleigh where they meet the Syra-
cuse-Pennsylvania winner.

“Pennsylvania might not play. We just called
them, and they don’t know what they’re going to do
yet.

“We've been scouting Syracuse some. We can’t
look ahead of Monday night’s game with Rhode Is
land or Connecticut.”

While the future foes of Davidson's eager, young
team square off tonight, Driesell will be holding an
open scrimmage with his ’Cats in Johnston gymna-
sium.

Driesell beamed a smile when he heard his team
compared with last year’s Princeton squad — both
with a senior superstar and a strong crop of sopho-
mores.

“T don’t know what they were like, I never saw
Princeton play last year,” Driesell grinned. “But if
we do as well as they did, it would please me.”

Less keyed up, Driesell admitted he planned to
try to win one game at a time. “Come back and talk
mae week,” he beamed proudly. “We’re planning
on it.”
