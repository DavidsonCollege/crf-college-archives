IMMORTALITY IS THEME OF
DISCUSSION BY DR. RICHARDS

Last Sunday Dr. CM. Richards gave
an excellent sermon on _ immortality,
using as his text: “If thesLord were

pleased to kill us, He would tet have
shown us all these things,” from Jtidges
13:23. He tok up each of the two books
of revelation which God has given—our
own constitution and the book of Revela-
tion in the Bible. Showing how, inborn
in our constitutions there is a belief in
and a longing for immortality, since al- |
most all religions hold forth that hope |
and even those who deny it, give as a
substitute, which at
foundation, immortality, he asked,
“Would God have given us this desire
if He were pleased to kill us?" ‘Then
briefly going through the whole Bible,
he pointed out that in the Old Testament
was a shadow of it, while in the New
Testament it is brought forth clearly in
the argument of Jesus that God said
to Moses: “Lam the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob.” He is not God of the
dead but of the living, .

something is its

Dr. Richards ended his sermon with
the question: “Would Jesus have died
for us if we had been nothing more than
beasts?” and witha plea that the men
of Davidson cling closer to their only
hope—Jesus. :

relief which administered food to the starv-
ing people. ‘This condition,” he said, “drew
the economic life blood of the population,
and people sold all their personal property in
order to buy food.”

Then, dealing with the educational side of

the question, he showed that the condition
among the students was even worse than in

The conditions in central Europe are tem-
porarily much the same. Conditions should

| become better because of the fact that stu-

dents in many countries are giving money in
an effort to remedy the situation. This

|money is used directly to give the students

food, clothing and medical attention. Its
indirect use is of greater advantage be-
cause it is used for the active promotion of
student self-help. In concluding his address
he told how the students of the college could

‘Billy Sunday Meetings in

Week

Davidson Students Hear Many of
Night Sermons

The Billy Sunday campaign, which has
been the greatest series of religious
meetings ever held in Charlotte, was
brought to a close with the night serv-
ices last Sunday evening, after six weeks
of daily meetings in which the taber-
nacle was crowded to overflowing at each
meeting.

The campaign was opened on Sunday,
December 30th, and not once during the
entire campaign has interest
During the opening weeks of his cam-
paign, Mr. Sunday flayed the Christians
for their inconsistences and then turn-
ed his voice to the non-Christians, using
all the powers at his command to win
them to Christ.

From the opening day of the meeting,
seats in the tabernacle were at a
mium. Especially during the services on
the Sabbath, hundreds were turned away
long before the time for the services to
begin.

Two meetings during the campaign
which were of special to the
Davidson students were the college night
in which about Wildcats

service held in the local chureh during

“Some folks think that they can go to
college four years, come out with a little
piece of a diploma, and then feel that all is
over. Why, they have just begun, and that
beginning is often very, very small. All that

the mark with a forceful description of how
