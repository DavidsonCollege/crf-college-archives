THE DAVIDSONIAN O PINI ONS MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1993

Pithy Irreverence...

Editor’s Note: Due to Mr.
Groundhog's recent prominence
in the news, The Davidsonian
thought it would be pertinent and
informative to talk with him. The
following interview took place in
the middle of a prairie somewhere
in Nebraska on February 2.
Davidsonian: Mr. Groundhog,
you’ ve been all over the news re-
cently, having features on all the
major networks, your name in all
the major newspapers. How can
you explain your celebrity status?
Mr. Groundhog: It’s publicity, kid!
Publicity! Do you know what
groundhogs do?
Davidsonian:
don’t.

Mr. Groundhog: That’s the way
we like it. You see, nobody really
‘knows what groundhogs naturally
do. Before we came up with the ad
campaign, we were just generic
rodents.

But through publicity, we
groundhogs created a whole in-
dustry. Thishas gotten way bigger
than meteorology. I have a day
named after me. How many hu-
mans do you know with days
named after them? Even Wash-
ington and Lincoln have had to
consolidate into“President’s Day.”

I have a great life. I have to
work one day a year. One. Actu-
ally, it’s more like fifteen seconds.
I pop up, look for my shadow,
smile for the cameras, and go back

No, I’m sorry, I

inside. Of course, this increases
the pressure a lot. But, hey, I’m a
groundhog. That’s my job.

Davidsonian: About this “seeing
your shadow” business - how could
you possibly see your shadow with

Sean Lind

all the TV camera high beams
trained on you? ;
Mr. Groundhog: Well, you see,
that’s a rather delicate matter. It’s
related to instinctand the like. Very
complicated to explain.
Davidsonian: Basically, then, it’s
a sham (or scam or whatever).
Mr. Groundhog: Not really. No
more than professional wrestling.

That’s the peculiar thing about you
humans - you’ ll believe most any-
thing, especially if it’s cute and
innocuous.

Davidsonian: Ona different note,
what do you think about all the
environmental devastation going
on? Doyou see yourself becoming
extinct?

Mr. Groundhog: Ithink it’s tragic,
what’s happening to our animal
brothers. But looking at it realisti-
Cally, it’s their own fault. Species
die off because they aren’t able to
adaptin this fast-changing modern
world. Know how to avoid extinc-
tion? Marketing. Advertising.
Give people a reason to want you
around. Groundhogs will never be
extinct, because all of America
looks to us at the beginning of
every February to determine the
course of Winter. The Bald Eagle
may soon bea thing of the past, but

-we’ll still be here.

Davidsonian: Any advice for the
little Groundhogs out there?
Groundhog: Well,I guessit would
be this: you have to find your
nitch. Everybody’s got something
to offer. Look at me. I started out
as an insignificant little rodent,
rather low on the food chain, and
now I’m one of the more important
mammals in America. Just goes to
show you - you can make of your-
self really whatever you like.

Good Advice for Underclassmen

By Alex Crumbley

Second semester, sophomore
year. Time to choose a major.

When we chose to come to
Davidson, we made a decision that
we knew would determine much
about the rest of our lives. Then,
many of us felt the stress that ac-
companies a life-changing deci-
sion. Two years later, Davidson
underclassmen feel a similar ulti-
matum approaching. If you’re not
stressed about it, good for you. If
you are, listen.

Ata time when we are at the
jumping off point forthe real world,
itseems thatourevery action some-
how will influence our success as
adults. Our summer plans, our
internships, the classes we take,
the grades we make, everything
secms so important because its
consequences may win or lose our

jobs or our graduate school accep-
tances; one blown test or missed
interview may mar our pretty re-
sumes and follow us for the rest of
our lives. Is it any wonder we
drink, put a comfortable fog in our
brains,-and forget about the pres-
sure of our potent college years?

“My God,” you say, “I didn’t
realize how much everything mat-
ters until Alex told me. My liveli-
hood hangs in the balance, and I
still can’t decide between ‘The
Simpsons’ and ‘Wings.’ What
about grad school, making money,
supporting a family? What if I
blow my test tomorrow? Will my
salary decrease? WhatifI blow an
exam? Will I work in the Outpost
all my life?”

Pub, finish reading. A few words
of wisdom may ease your troubled

Nelson’s face, it’s unfair to as-
sume that no white people can
dance or that no black people like
Willie Nelson. What is even more
unfair is make assumptions about

a person’s attitudes, capabilities,

and preferences based on his race,
or to make judgments about him
when these assumptions don’t fit
the so-called norm. We all have
expectations based on race, but the
difference between expectations

and assumptions is that you treat
someone ina certain way based on
your assumptions, whereas expec-
tations reflect merely the way you

Union in the mostly-white
group is not less than black
or more than black..."

expect someone to act, not how
you act towards him.

Being black is more than just
skin colorand racial identity. While
many black people share a general
culture, many also enjoy aspects of

minds. This sounds ludicrous, but
something I read on the wall of a
bathroom in Atlanta really makes
sense, and it didn’t have any bad
words or a telephone number with
it. It said:

“One can understand the de-
sire of today’s undergraduates to
leave college with a readily mar-
ketable skill. There is nothing
wrong in this. But if our colleges
and universities begin to turn out
graduates with little else but this
training, where will be found the
statesmen, the philosophers, the
moralists, and the thinkers, with-
out whom no society can hope for
greatness?”

I found out later that Alan
Pifer, whoever that is, wrote this in
a book. Why someone chose to

white culture. The black personin .

the Union in the mostly-white
group isnotless than black ormore
than black because of his friends;
you can hardly tell what he’s like
just by the company he keeps.
There’s nothing wrong people en-
joying aspects of other cultures.
What is wrong is treating differ-
ently those who cross the lines.
While it is important never to for-
get your culture and your past,
there’s nothing wrong with hang-
ing out with people from a differ-
ent race or culture.

An Interview with Mr. Groundhog Mascots are Silly ~

When one chooses a college,
he usually docsn’t select based on
mascots. However, team names
and mascots are extremely impor-
tant. Many schools are known
because of their mascots. In pro
sports, team names are also a rea-
son to root for a team. We've
reached a crossroads in sports.
Many college team names are po-
litically incorrect, and many are
just horribly boring. New profes-
sional franchises are struggling also
with naming their teams.

While the Florida St. Semi-
noles still have a mounted brave
who starts each game with a chal-
lenging spear thrust into the ground,
and Illinios still retains its “Chief
Illini” mascot, colleges from
Dartmouth to Stanford have cho-
sen to abandon their American In-
dian symbolism. This is because
many activists claim that Indian
names are somchow insulting and
degrade Native Americans (itnever
occured to them that “brave is a
compliment.”

In the Stanford case, the ad-
ministration made the mistake of
holding a contest. While “Robber
Barons” won (in honor of the
school’s founder, Leland Stanford),
they chickened out, of course, and
opted for an innocuous “Cardinal”
(are plural. nicknames too
politicially incorrect?).

Pro teams, however, can more
easily resist the urge to conform
because they must answer only to
the fans, who generally aren’t as
hyper-sensitive as college admin-
istrators and Indian activists. The
Atlanta Braves’ fans chop away,
as do Ted Turner and his lively
new bride Jane “I’m Fonda com-

_Munism.” Those (formerly) fear-

some Washington Redskinsare still
the only NFL team to employ a
full-time band, whose chubbily
feathered musicians are a true in-
sult to the fitness of most Native
Americans.

But let us get away from poli-
tics and speak about quality. The

best college mascots, the Syracuse
Orangemen and the Richmond
Spiders, are those uniquely identi-
fied with a specific school, espe-
cially if itis relevant such as in the
case of the Virginia Cavaliers. This
does result in comical oxymorons
occasionally as in the case of the
“Demon Deacons,” or the “Fight- ¢
ing Quakers” of Penn, or Notre
Dame (which means “Our Lady”
inFrench), whoseathletesare urged
to kill in her name.

Professional teams are best
advised, on the other hand, to stay
generic because they move around
too much. Hence “Athletics” is
just as appropriate to Oakland as it
was to Philadelphia, but “Jazz” is
not found in Utah. When they
moved from New Orleans, there
wasn’t enough room on the uni-
forms to write “Mormon Taber-
nacle Choir,” so they kept the name
“Jazz.”

. . No offense, but the problem
with the Davidson “Wildcats” is
that it is too commonplace for a
school so distinctive. There are
simply too many, from Arizona to
Villanova. “Wildcats” could work
ifourmascotdid something unique,
like the St. Joseph’s “Hawk,” who
flaps his wings slowly for the cn-
tire game without a respite. There
actually are some real Wildcats in
the farthest reaches of North Caro-
lina (I don’t mean BackStreet),
while authentic “Tar Heels” are
difficult to find, and, true, “Blue
Devils” are probably limited to the
hills of West Virginia.

However, there are many more ;
distinctive names we could use.
We could use animal names like
the “Opossums” or the “Spider
Monkeys.” Wecould use uniquely
Davidson names like the
“Courtsmen” (as in Patterson), or
the “Ruskies.” I will leave the rest
to you, but wouldn’t you love to
see a team come trotting out onto
the basketball court with “the
Davidson CHAL’s” on their uni-
forms? | didn’t think so.

Rude Notes &
Random Scribblings

Every once in a while I get an
urge to write about something.
Problem is, I’m not very good at it.
Actually, that’s not a problem for
me, because no matter what I write,
I can fit it in The Davidsonian.
However, it is a problem for you,
because you have to read it. Well,
actually, you don’t have to read it,
you can just admire the sexy pic-
ture in the middle of my text.

Anyway, this is going to be
the last thing I can slip into the
paper for about a year, so enjoy it.
(If you haven’t read Andrew
Spainhour’s column yet you prob-
ably don’t know that there’s some
type of change going on at The
Davidsonian. In fact, I bet An-
drew talks about change at
Davidson, not just the paper, over
the past four years of his career.
But, Ihaven’t read it, yet. I’ve just

heard about it.)

Have you ever noticed there
are a good deal of things going on
at Davidson that you simply donot
understand. Well, I have, but that
may be just because I’m an idiot.

For example, VAX. What the
hell is this? I mean I know how to
get my mail and look at this thing
called Notes where you can write
neat little messages to the whole
campus and people can read ‘em,
But what about these people who
use it to call other people in places
like Jerusalem. And why don’t
they just use a phone?

As for the rest of the VAX,
forget it. Did you know there is a
manual for the thing that is about
three feetthick downstairs in cham-
bers. (This place isevidently called
