Handbook. . “Guys and girls are
involved in different activities
and they have a different out-
look.” ;

Iles and Kelley cited “new
ideas, enthusiasm, dedication .
and different backgrounds” as
their major strengths as candi-
dates. Iles was editor of her
high school’s literary magazine
for two years. Kelley was
co-editor of her high school
yearbook and worked on her
high school newspaper. She has
also helped with newspaper
layout in the College alumni
office. —

Iles is a hall counselor and
Kelley has contact with fresh-
men through her work at ARA
Slater and with the Big Sister
program. They said they are
running together because they
have worked well together in
the past on Y Student Service
Corps and hall projects. Kelley
added that since she is not a hall
counselor, she could put a
maximum amount of tinle into
the Handbook.

Carter and Long said they
would improve on last year’s
Handbook by including direc-
tions to favorite student destin-
ations, a map of Charlotte, tips
on such things as where to get
your hair cut and where to eat,
as well as information on Col-
lege activities.

Iles and Kelley said they
would condense the articles on
College activities and include
information on restaurants,
good places to study, and
people to see in various situa-
tions. They plan to seek addi-
tional ideas from this year’s

Most importantly, Iles and
Kelley said, ‘our goal is to have
everything completed by sum-
mer break.’’ Carter and Long
also emphasized completing the
Handbook early.

Warren Beck paces swimmers to win over J.C. Smith

By JIM CROWE

The Davidson swimming
team began the 1980-81 season
on a positive stroke Monday as
they soundly defeated J.C.
Smith, 82-29. _

Davidson swimmers captured
all first places in the meet.

Junior Warren Beck showed
well with firsts in the 100
yard freestyle, 50 yard free-
style, and 400 yard medly
style, and 400 yard medley
relay. Junior Keith Riddle cap-

tured firsts in the 200 yard
breaststroke and the 1000 yard
freestyle. Sophomore Frank
Bright won first in one meter
diving.

Others winning individual
firsts were Mike Schremmer,
Rick Williams, Mark Ham-
mond, and John Edwards. Dav-
idson won both the 400 yard
medley and the 400 yard free-
style medley

had to take over the bankrupt
school, recruit first year stu-
dents, organize the construction
of a dormitory, buy books, hire
teachers, arrange for national
exams—and teach science and
agricultural biology.

Is it effective? Davidson vol-
unteers are not saving the
world, obviously. But a recent
letter from Andy Miller ’80,
headmaster of Shikokho School,
testifies to what can be done.
“I’m getting deeper and deeper
into my work and the com-
munity,” he wrote. ‘It is so
wonderful to see your efforts
make such a tangible difference
in people’s lives and possibi-
lities. . .I’m breaking ground
for our own classroom building
next week, just trusting we'll
find money to complete it. . .
Also ordering books and furni-
ture as we anticipate going from
70 students to 150-200 next
year.”

The volunteers do make
changes; even more, they are
changed themselves. ‘tI don’t
think I heard anybody who
came back from Kenya who
didn’t say that it was, bar none,
the peak experience of their
lives,’” Wood said.

“The experience is very re-

8-6 finish last year, began con-

a lot better now than they
did last year at this time.
Our starts and turns also are
a lot more polished.’

warding,’”’ Glen Darbyshire ’79
wrote from Kenya, ‘‘The un-
structured nature of Davidson’s
‘program’ is challenging in that
each of us must explore, adjust,
then choose the vision he de-
sires to achieve in the time he
has.”’

The experience ‘‘exorcised
some useless idealism,” Keller
said, but also taught that ‘“‘a
few people can change a lot.’’ In
a position of responsibility the
volunteer learns to ‘‘find stren-
gth in himself, to find his own
talents, failings, shortcom-

Working in Kenya taught
him that one can “sustain a
service activity in which there is
little acknowledgement,’’ Dar-
byshire said, ‘‘and that it takes
no ideological basis to serve—
you do it for its own sake.”

Darbyshire’s year in Kenya
also demonstrated how little it
takes to be happy, he added,
citing the essentials as ‘‘health,
nourishment, and a channel for
creativity.”’

“*You’re not changing the
culture,” he added, but in a
densely populated, poor region,
“‘you give a few students hope.”’

And of course, it is not all
service. There is the joy of
exploring a new culture, of
living in a changing and beauti-

ful land, of going to big game
parks, climbing 14,000 foot Mt.
Elgon, and swimming in the
Indian Ocean. Over and over,
the volunteers spoke with love
of the strange, rich juxtaposi-
tions which abound in Kenya.

“It’s not primitive National
Geographic country,’’ Darby-
shire said. ‘‘You see mud huts
with Olivia Newton-John blar-
ing from the radios inside.’’
While people wash clothes in
the river and preserve some
tribal superstitions, they also
collect photographs, discuss
politics and books, and dream
of moving to the capital city.
The local secondary schools are
very poorly equipped, but their
curricula is only about one year
behind ours at the same gra
Darbyshire said.

There are the matatus— small
pickup trucks which literally go
anywhere and always too fast —
and ugali, corn meal paste, the
staple food—and students who
gather their animals into their
hut for the night before begin-
ing to read their physics.

Miller wrote enthusiastically
this fall, ‘‘So far, I am a Head-
master /Farmer/Contractor/
Teacher and am afraid to find
out what comes next!”

(See Kenya, page 9)

Frank Bright, bring back pro-
ven strength to the team.

Miller said that swimmers
in the freshman class bring
greatly needed depth and ver-
satility to the squad. Fresh-
man team members are Bill
Vline, Roy Martin, and John
Lyday.

The junior class is by far
the strongest class of swim-
mers, with eight team mem-
bers. Beside Schremmer, Fin
ger and Beck, the third year
class includes Rick Williams,
Keith Riddle, Tony Smith,
Craig Allen, and Mark Ham-
mond.

Miller explained that the
large number of junior swim-
mers is due to changing re-
cruiting procedures. ‘‘Four
years ago the swim team had a
recruiting budget of $665, so we
were able to do some recruit-
ing. Now, our recruiting budget
has been cut to $91.33, and
there is really no serious recrut-
ing.”’ Miller said that even bro-
cure mailings are no longer fin-
ancially feasible.

Other team members are
seniors Don Matthews. Ralph
Mosca, and Ed Imbrogno, and
sophomores John Edwards and
Bill Michel.

The team will face stiff com-
petition in the conference this
year, including the strong Ap-
palaachian, Citadel, and Fur-
man teams which have increas-
ed their scholarship spending
this year.

Miller said that the Davidson
team could finish anywhere
from second to fifth in the con-
ference.

During the Christmas break,
the team will travel to Florida
for workouts.

The next meet is Friday, Jan-
uary 16, against the College
of Charleston and S.C. State
in Charleston. The Cats face
the Citadel in Charleston the
following day.
