Renovation Era Transposes

Pinball Machine For Carrel

She was the first real
relationship I had at David-

college first began to appear,
it was to her that I ran.

I learned to turn to her with
my academic problems, and it
was with her that I sat and
forged dreams about my
future into decisions and

We spent many hours
together, she and I. It reached
the point where if I neglected
her a single day I felt pangs of
guilt.

Upon returning from a
weekend away, I rushed to her
side many late Sunday nights,
knowing that I couldn’t face

my professors on Monday
without first spending time
with her.

I came to know her every
peculiarity, her secret
places, the way she felt, and
her musky aroma. She was so
much my life that I never ex-
pected us to part while I
remained at Davidson. But it
is over.

No more will family and
friends call me only to hear a
roommate say, ‘Sorry, he is
with Carrel tonight.” She is no
more, Grey memorial is soon
to be a Union, and the new
library has no carrels to
replace her.

Forgive my nostalgia. As I

Doodling Dumfounds Prof. a

Recently, a professor in

England allowed his students .

either to doodle or to take
notes in his classes. A year
later, the doodle group had
retained more than the note
takers.

Whereas this was a notewor-
thy discovery, there is still the
question of whether - the
drawing triggered a recall of
the subject or whether the
doodle itself was memorable.

Harold, a student who at-
tended a progressive college,
was similarly allowed to
choose between traditional

note taking and doodling.

years of § college
somewhere, between the First
and Second World Wars, a-pic-
ture of the Mole-Faced Sheik
of Araby surfaced in his
history doodles.

Actually, there was no
logical explanation for the
drawing, as the middle
Eastern situation had never
been particularly stressed in
his classes. Yet Harold could
not think of either war without
visualizing the Mole-Faced
Sheik of Araby as the central
theme, for the Mole-Faced
Sheik of Araby symbolized 18
classroom hours of notes and
had virtually become both
World War I and World War II.
to Harold.

When on his final exam
Harold was asked to compare
the world wars, he eagerly
sketched two portraits of the
Mole-Faced Sheik’ of Araby,
the Sheik of the First World
War somewhat thinner than
the Sheik of the Second World
War. Harold knew that men in
World War II were fatter, due

to the influence of candy bars

and Scotch.

Professor . Tittletoft,
Harold’s history mentor, con-
fronted by the Mole-Faced
Sheik of Araby -on the first
page of Harold’s bluebook,
saw three possibilities.

1) Harold was joking.

2) Harold knew something
he didn’t know.

3) Harold was crazy.

Professor Tittleoft discar-
ded his first hypothesis
because of the lack of levity in
modern students. No one who
used recycled paper would

‘ Tittletoft created a

fool around with the world
wars.

Now he was torn between
the possibility of Harold’s
superior knowledge and the
notion of insanity.

Professor  Tittletoft
scoured the library and found

tably, no mention of his

theory em-
ploying the Mole-Faced Sheik
of Araby as the pivotal link in
the connection between the
two wars.

Mentioning sag de per-
ceptive grasp portraying
the girth of the two sheiks,
praising his refreshing
brevity, Professor Tittletoft
passed Harold with. an A-.

Letter To The Editor.

(The second drawing was
somewhat smudged. )

Professor Tittletoft had not
forgotten the possibility of
Harold’s probable insanity ; he
had just pushed it into his sub-
conscious. _

For somehow. there
something distinctively un-
comfortable in the possibility
of having had a madman grin-
ning at you in an 8 o’clock
class all year.

The professor gently urged

Harold to see a trist,
and while no light was shed on
the Mole-Fac Sheik of

Araby, an intricate complex
concerning rubber bands
‘came to light which had
Harold tied up in knots for
years.

Directly after passing

became obsessed with the
Mole-Faced Sheik of Araby.

way through decaying tomes,
searching for information on
the Sheik.

As this behavior continued,
Professor Tittletaft became
more and more emaciated and
wild-eyed, until the college
had to bar him from his
classes. This action served
only to increase his maniacal
drive.

The professor was last seen
slipping silently between the
stacks, wearing an. Arabian
turban and robe.

Professor Tittletoft’s disin-
tegration proves once more
what experienced teachers
have always known and bud-
ding pedants suspected:

Doodling may not be
detrimental to students, but it
can drive a teacher crazy.

, pus controversy. on which to
“issue a scathing editorial, I
was reminded that this week
the college community
gathers to baptize the newest
addition to Mother Davidson’s
family.

Friday we are all invited to
express our gratitude to Mr.
E. H. Little for his support, not
to mention his millions, in
modernizing Davidson.

Situated between two homes
of frequent Davidson mistakes
and failures, the new struc-
ture’s stylistic synthesis of
neoclassical, Jeffersonian,
and what some have described
as ‘contemporary ugly,’’ of-
fers us concrete evidence that

‘ cynicism is unfounded; David-

son College does indeed make
progress.

Yes, one cannot deny that
those of us who have been here
for three or four years have
seen the ushering in of a new
era in Davidsoniana. Though
there was much to be said for
the old days of dungeon-like
libraries and involuntarily im-
posed celibacy on campus,
few will mourn the passing of
those days.

Memories will remain with
us to provide, succor as we
pass into a alumni status and
return only infrequently to
grumble at the changes God
and Time hath wrought.

And so for the present and
the new image of Davidson’
College, let us rejoice and be
glad. After all, as soon as
renovation is completed we
can all gather to pass the time
at pinball where Chalmers on-
ce lurked and join other Union
dwellers in writing mom and
dad to tell them that we spend
12 hours a day in the (Grey)
library.

State Law Forces Police To Tote Guns

To the Editor:

The editorial “Sticking To
Their Gups or Making Things
Uniform”’ in the Sept. 13 issue
lacked a thorough search into
the situation before it was
written.

Returning students did meet
Davidson policmen on the
other side of the Davidson
College ID camera in an effort
for the students to get to know
them as part of an i

security system°at Davidson

College.
As Davidson policemen,
however, they are not cee
officers,

required to enforce state and
local laws, and because of the
state laws, they must carry
certain weapons while in
uniform and certain equip-

» ment in any patrol car used.

Last year, Davidson College
chose to contract the Town of
Davidson police to aid in the
college security system.

forcement of the laws by the

sidered citizens of the town
and are expected to share the
responsibilities. of such
citizenship.
Precinct Two of the Town of
Davidson __ police was
established to make the town
police more able to do their in-
creased job. Any criminal ac-
tivity on the Davidson College
campus ‘whether committed
by (and hopefully only by)
persons outside of the David--
son College community or by
students and people in town
would have to be investigated
by the , even if the
college had a completely
separate security system. _

The town police were not.
contracted by the college to
harass students, but to help
when students call for them.

However, Precinct Two is

not exclusively for problems -

that occur on the college cam-
pus but must respond as well
to calls involving other’ parts
of the town:

Lieutenant Hughes is in
direct charge of Precinct Two.
He is responsive to student
ideas and observations and
will meet with anyone about
any problem that person may
have, especially a problem of
a security-related nature.

The other police officers in
Precinct Two are men ‘who
know the campus and students
well. They are more than
willing to listen to students, to
talk with them, and to be of
help while performing their
jobs as town police.

With Davidson College a
