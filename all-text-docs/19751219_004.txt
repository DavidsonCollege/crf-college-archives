Male chorus exploresorigins,growth

By BILL CROSLAND

The Davidson College Male
Chorus had its origins in a
quartet which sang at com-
mencement exercises. Stimu-
lated by the interest of stu-
dents, the group doubled in
size to an amateur octet.

The group during its in-
fancy was directed by stu-
dents and accompanied by a
faculty secretary. New impe-
tus to a choral organization
was given with the hiring of
James C. Pfohl as Director of
Music and his efforts to organ-
ize a Music Department at
Davidson.

Through the directorship
and leadership of Thane Mc-
Donald (1933-1940), Earl Berg
(1940-1951) and Donald B.
Plott,,who assumed director-
ship in 1952, the Davidson
College Male Chorus has
grown over the past 75 years
to 31 voices and a reputation
as one of the finest male
choral organizations in the
nation.

Originally, the group was
called a glee club, but upon

Berg’s arrival the title was
changed: to that of a male
chorus. This change was a
reaction to the connotations
which surrounded the name
“glee club”’.

Cree clubs, at that time,
existed at major universities
where they combined with

women’s voices to form a.

choir, but more importantly
they traveled to sing at alumni
functions. The glee club per-
formance with this became
associated with merriment and
frivolous music.

The title of Male Chorus
gave performances an air of
seriousness and. projected the
type of music that was to be
performed.

The Male Chorus vocally
consists of first tenor, second
tenor, baritone and bass. With
this vocal structure, the chor-
us is limited in its repertoire
because much mixed chorus
music is not conducive to an
effective male chorus perform-
ance, but the door is wide open
to male chorus music of tre-
mendous quality.

inconvenience,’ said Beaver.
“The College laundry saves
students the time and trouble
of hovering over machines
waiting for their clothes. Par-
ents don’t send their kids to
college to wash clothes,”
said Beaver.
“By paying a set laundry
fee, students are not bothered

through the year with needs
for ‘laundry money’. And
since we also provide linen
service, sheets and pillowcases
are simply two less items that
must be bought and packed off
to College,” continued Beaver.
_ “The laundry fee is very
reasonable. I don’t believe any
outside operation could pro-

‘vide our services at the same

cost. And despite the increase
of utilities’ bills, the fee has
remained stable for three
years. As long as all the
students pay the fee, we can
hold it down to a reasonable
figure,’’ said Beaver.

Beaver thinks that only a

why the Male Chorus in its
annual Christmas Vespers
Service does not do many of
the traditional carols.

The reason is that many
carols are not properly ar-
ranged for a male chorus, that
not being their original inten-
tion. However, if the group
was to do them, other Christ-
mas music written for and
unique to male chorus per-

‘formanc2 would go undone.

The Male Chorus repertoire
and concert programs consist
of some of the best male
chorus music available, thus it
seeks to present music which
only a group of its kind can
perform effectively. Many
audiences have enjoyed the
uniqueness of the Male Chor-
us’ programs and the sonority,
timbre and finesse a group of
its kind gives to music.

The Davidson College Male

Chorus, directed by Plott, has
appeared in principal cities
from Miami to New York City
to Detroit to New Orleans and
the ‘four corners” of Texas
and has in the past presented
coast-to-coast radio broad-
casts over all the major net-
works.

The Chorus also has to its
credit several records. Last
year ; Chorus logged 2,500
mes in a ten-day Spring Tour
through the Southwest with
major stops in Nashville,
Memphis, Dallas, Houston,
New Orleans, and Atlanta.
The group is now preparing for
and ar.ticipating its 40th
Avnial Spring Tour through
western and central Florida.

Plott, affectionately known
as the ‘‘Silver Fox’’, ‘Pappa
Plott”, ‘Daddy Don’ and
“DBP”~is.a graduate. of the
University of Michigan, where

he also received a master’s
degree in music. In addition to
being director of the Davidson
Chorus, Plott is head of the
music department and _ins-
tructor in voice. He also serves
as director of the Oratorio
Singers of Charlotte while also
serving as choir director at the
Steele Creek Presbyterian
Church in Charlotte.

Plott is in constant demand
as a lecturer and conductor at
music festivals and camps. He
is a former president of the
Intercollegiate Musical Coun-
cil and has served on the
Advisory Council on Church
Music for the Presbyterian
Church, U.S.

The Male Chorus’ next
scheduled performance at
Davidson College will be its
Spring Concert on March 12,

the college and the Chief of
Police at Precinct One.

Under the new structure,
Hughes was promoted to Cap-
tain, the same rank as the
Chief of Police. Hughes now
reports to Meetze on daily
operating procedures. Both
precincts report to the Town
Commissioners on matters
such as the hiring and firing of
members of the force.

“What this amounts to is a
separation of the two depart-
ments. There are now two
distinct departments,” said
Hughes.

“Precinct One serves the
Town of Davidson and Pre-

laundry

small minority of the students
want to do their own laundry
and consequently favor a vo-
luntary set-up.

“There is certainly no indi-
cation that student use of the
laundry is declining. We have
more clothes to clean than ever
before. And if any student
does wish to wash and dry his
own clothing, we now provide
machines for that purpose at
no cost,”’ said Beaver.

“Davidson is unique in that
we are one of the few schools
left that operates its own
laundry system. I believe it
offers many advantages to the

student,’’ concluded Beaver.

cinct Two serves the college. I
don’t work through a chief of
police anymore. Both the
Chief and myself report to a
police commissioner: the
Chief to Mr. Naramore and
myself to Mr. Meetze at the
college,’’ he said.

Meetze commented on the
purpose of the change. ‘“‘What
I’ve tried to do with this
change,” explained Meetze,
‘is bring Precinct Two up to

the same level as Precinct
One. By strengthening Pre-
cinct Two, it will be able to do
a better job on campus.

“Of course, Precinct Two is
still a part of the police force.
This gives our campus secur-
ity force a good rapport with
the local police before any-
thing happens. It also means

we can call in reinforcements if
they’re needed,’ said Meetze.

zations.

“The SGA is a_hodge-
podge,” said Baskin. ‘We
have councils; boards, auton-
omous boards and non-auton-
omous boards that we deal
with. We need to define these
relationships,’ he added.

“We have a very vague
relationship with the College
Union. The whole idea of a
college union needs a defini-
tion. What is a college
union?,’’ asked Baskin.

“We need to find out what
certain groups really are, and

what they do. What is a
YM/YWCA? The SGA holds
elections for these groups, but
is that all? The Senate has the
right to change the by-laws of
an organization, but we don’t
have a clear idea of what a lot
of organizations do,” said
Baskin.

‘‘The Interorganizational
Forum is designed to organize
between organizations but I
still have the question that I
had when it was started. I
believe the IOF is just a club
of clubs. The relationships
between them are not de-
fined,’’ commented Baskin.

it, everyone at the meeting
was in agreement that the
strays should be picked up,”’
said Currie. The meeting was
held primarily for communica-
tion, so both town and College
would know what the other
was doing. :

“IT really think it’s the
town’s dogs that are the

problem, so it’s the town’s job
to control them,” said Carol
Connor. Because the dogs

don’t belong to the students,
the question was raised of
whose responsibility they are.

According to Currie, the
town and the college will work
closely on the problem. ‘‘The ~
town will do its fair share in

keeping away strays,” he said.
