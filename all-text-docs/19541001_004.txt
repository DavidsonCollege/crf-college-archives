Charleston Contest Is
Rated As Toss-Up Scrap

BY BUNNY PERKINSON

First V.M.I, then Stetson, and tomorrow the Citadel.
That’s the hope of the coaches, the team, and the large num-
ber of students making the trip to Charleston for the game at

the Citadel tomorrow night.
sight that has been ve

hree games won in a row is a
seldom seen around the old D.C. cam-

pus lately, but no doubt, many boys would like to witness it

tomorrow.

The jinx on Davidson football
captains is running true to form
this year, with Dickie Davis now
sidelined with a knee injury and
unable to see any action against
the Bulldogs. He will be sorely
missed, but the spirit displayed in
the first two games should pull the
"Cats through. The game is rated a
toss-up by many observers, but
Wildcat followers have been pleas-
ed to note the effort the Bulldogs
had to exert to conquer little Elon
last week in their first game of the
season. However, one should never
underestimate the ferocity of the
Bulldogs in their back yard, so the
game should be a good one from:
the initial whistle to the final horn. -

Oavidson’s 1954 football Captain,
Dickie Davis, will be out of the
Wildcat line-up for tomorrow
night's invasion of The Citadel.
Davis was injured in the first
quarter of last week's contest
against Stetson. His sparkling
pley in the line will be missed
egainst the Bulldogs.

Thus far, Coach Dole has enjoyed
much success in his use of the two-
team system, in which one team
plays the first and third Quarters
and another plays the second and
fourth quarters; so he will un-

To Close Win Over Stetson, 19-13) 5 /

downs to the good at the end of the first half and apparently off to the races, the Wildcats

stand, Stetson attack, featuring something of the Southwest's famed “spread formation.”

sophomore who has been looking

Before a “Homecoming - like”
crowd, excited by the first-game
win over V. M. L, Davidson ‘ex-
ploded to grab two touchdowns in
the first period and add a third in
the second period. Leading this
onslaught as far as touchdowns
were concerned, were halfback Har-
ley Smith with two and halfback
Barney Poole with a single one.

Smith, running the ball only
occasionally due to his right half-
back position, gained well with
each of five or six carries. Poole,
fecently recovered from a pre-sea-
son injury, could easily be credited
with sparking Davidson’s running
attack. His frequent breaks into

‘lthe Stetson secondary allowed the

Hatters few moments of peace. |

Although the Wildcats’ second
half play was hampered by numer-
ous rule infractions, Stetson manu-
factured its comeback with an im-
proved brand of play. Their fourth
period score, which struck fear in-
to the hearts of Davidson rooters,
came on a 78-yard pass-and-run
eombination. Stetson halfback Ste-
phenson gathered in the pass from
fullback Singletary, neatly revers-
ed his field, and literally out-raced
the Davidson secondary to the goal.

According to rushing yardage
and first downs, the Wildcats held
a definite edge over Stetson, due in
a large measure to the plunging
strikes of fullbacks Brown and
| Conger. and the front-line work of
Tom Newton, Bill Gramley, Jim
Fasul, and Bill Price.

October 4, at 2:30 P. M.

TERESA WRIGHT says: “Up to 16, my knowledge of acting
had been gleaned from seeing movies. When I saw my first
professional play, that was it: I only wanted to act. I got into
high school plays, wrestled props at Provincetown, understudied,

sat for months in producers’

Geek Schedule Sel
By Sports Managers

Coach “Pete” Whittle met Tues-
day night at 7 o'clock in the Trophy
Room of the gymnasium with the
fraternity sports managers to plan
the ‘5455 intramural sports sea-
son. Competition for the coveted in-
ter-fraternity trophy will be in four
major activities — tag football, bas-
ketball, softball, and varsity compe-
tition—four intermediate activities
—vwrestling, volléyball, track, and
swimming — and three minor ac-
tivities: — handball, horseshoes,
and tennis. These activities are
grouped according to the number
of points a fraternity can possibly
receive by entering in the various
sports. A greater amount can be
scored in the major activities than
in the minor.

The managers decided to award
the good sportsmanship trophy
again this year and to change the
tennis program.

Tennis Changed

In the past, a round-robin tennis
tournament was held during a per-
iod of about two weeks, but this
slow system proved ineffective. Un-
der the new rules, a regular tennis
tournament with elimination and
consolation will be held, lasting
about three days. Each fraternity
will enter two contestants who will
receive points according to how far
they progress in the meet; the men
advancing the farthest will score
the greatest number of points.
Coach Whittle and the sports man-
agers hope that this new method,
which is similar to the way in
which the wrestling tournament is
conducted, will prove more effec-
tive than the former system and
will increase the interest in the
tennis competition.

The intermural sports program
begins Monday, October 4, when the
first tag football series takes place.

The managers selected by the
various fraternities are listed be-
low:

S. P. E. — Charles Brown.

Phi Delts — Dan Leach.

Kappa Sig — Corky Clark.

Beta — Tom Lambe.

A. T. O. — Cliff Deal.

Phi Gam. — Jack Bolen and Bob-
by Joe Key.

S. A. E. — Steve Norton.

Sigma Chi — Curtis Cates.

Pikas — Joe Billy Pharr.

Pi Kapps — G. N. Henson.

Dick McKee Is New
Veep Of SC Writers

Davidson's Athletic Department
proudly announced this week that
Coach Dick McKee has been ap-
pointed Vice-President of The Sou-
thern Conference Sportswriters As-
sociation. McKee has won this hon-
or as a “rookie,” having only taken
over the reins of the Davidson Ath-
letic Publicity Department on Sep-
tember 1.

In his new position, McKee will
work with the two other top execu-
tives of the Association. President
of the group is Bill Evans, of the
“Fairmont Times,” in Fairmont,
West Virginia. Mickey Furfari is
Executive Secretary.

The purpose of the Association
is to keep the Southern Conference
activities in the public eye. This
has become increasingly important
since 1953, when the old confer-
ence split, and the Atlantic Coast
Conference was formed.

The rival conference has strong-
er teams, with a few exceptions,
and until the SC can get on its
feet (as it is doing) the sportswrit-
ers must keep it in the headlines.

The three football coaches behind the Davidson team that
is doing things this year that haven’t happened in years sa
that work is still needed if this is to continue. Head coach Bi
Dole refused to comment on last week’s game with Stetson but
talked a little about the game this week. He remarked, ‘Citadel
will be a severe test, and it will require a combined V.M.L ef-
fort along with our share of the breaks. That's all I have to say.”

Coach “Chuck” Clements, who
scouted Citadel's game, last Satur-
day, didn't get to watch the Wild-
cats play. However, he did say, “the
defense has got to be better before
Saturday.” When asked about his
trip to Charleston, he stated, “The
Citadel club is big and fast. In oth-
er words, it is a good, all-around
team.”

Line Coach Carroll Hambright
was more detailed in his remarks
concerning the past victory. When
asked about the contest, a serious
look came over his face, and he
said, “The blocking must improve.
Believe it or not, I don’t remember
a single man in the secondary be-
ing knocked off his feet. If our
backs are to make long runs, our
other men must fulfill their assign-
ments until the whistle blows. The
downfield blocking must get vi-
cious. In general, Davidson didn't
function as a well-oiled machine, ex-
cept in spurts. We have the mak-
ings of a great club if all the men
are willing to pay the price of
building into strength any weakness
that we may have.” With this he
smiled and walked away, as if to
say, “Just wait until Saturday for
the rest of the story.”

WILDCAT GOLFERS
TO BEGIN WORKOUTS

Coach Danny Miller, after a
meeting of upper-classmen who are
candidates for Davidson's Varsity
Golf Team, has announced that sev-
eral fall matches are being arrang-
ed in order that the team may get
into actual competition before win-
ter sets in.

About twenty-five men showed
up at a meeting held last week, and
the potential for the team looks
very good. Several members of last
year’s Southern Conference Cham-
Pionship club are back, though
Captain Graeme Keith was lost via
the graduation route.

Coach Miller has asked that ail
freshmen interested in going out
for the team meet in the lobby of
the gym next Monday at 2:30 p. m.
There should be a large turn-out
since several members of the fresh-
man class are already quite talent.

is Pat Brady, last year's North Car.

Our heartiest congratulations to
Coach McKee who has been doing
a fine job in our Sports Depart-
ment.

Most of the teams, however, in-
cluding pre-season favorite West
Virginia, have not begun confer.
ence action yet.

West Virginia, on the basis of |
last year’s record and the number
and quality of returning lettermen,
is an odds-on choice to cop the con-
ference title again this year. They
open the season this Saturday
against a non-conference foe, South
Carolina, last week’s upset-winner
over powerful Army.

Davidson will try to increase
their lead this week when they tra-
vel to Citadel for a Saturday night
tussle. Citadel beat Elon in a
squeaker last week, scoring two
touchdowns in the last three min-
utes of play to win, 21-13, Coach
Bill Dole is expecting plenty of
trouble from a team that last year
soundly trounced the Cats.

The week’s schedule:

Saturday—William and Mary at
Pennsylvania, George Washington
at Virginia, West Virginia at South
Carolina, Virginia Tech at Clem-
son,

Saturday night—Virginia Mili-
tary at Richmond, Davidson at The
Citadel.
