W. Georgia Takes Relays

As Wildcats Finish

In a day of records West
Georgia held off Davidson
and Appalachian to win the
Davidson Relays in the final
event. On other fronts the
baseball and golf teams
both played well but couldn't
cash their play into wins.

Going into the two-mile
relay, Davidson held a
two - point edge over West

Georgia, and Appalachian
trailed by 6% points. How-
eyer, the host Wildcats fail-
ed to tally in the last event,
while West Georgia came
home third to sew up the
championship with 51 points.
‘Appalachian finished sec-
ond with 48% points on the

strength of a second in the
two-mile relay, while Da-
vidson had to settle for third
with 47. points, Pre-meet
favorite. Western Carolina
was a disappointing fourth,
well back with 394% points.
West Georgia established
new meet standards in the
880-yard relay (1:28.6) and
the one-mile relay (3:19.3)
and also captured the 440
yard relay in compiling their
winning total.
' Other records were set in
the shot put by Dave Tay-
lor of Catawba (51'9%"'),

year from Davidson as they

New ‘Y’ Offense, Personnel

Focus Of Spring Workouts

Even a_ championship
team can make changes and
the Wildcat football — staff
is planning to make several
changes in their plans for
Davidson's defense of their
first football title,

Davidson head coach Dave

Fagg pointed to several
changes which he and the
staff will be implementing

in spring drills which  be-
gin tomorrow.

With the departure’ of
three starting offensive
backs and the two regular
split receivers. Fagg is bas
ng his new offensive forma
tions ‘'to best suit the play
ers which we have."’

_The ‘Cats will be working
to replace last year's
Straight “'T'’ formation with
two split ends with the
“Texas Y."' The idea of two
split ends will be retained,
although Fagg ‘also indicat-
ed that he intended to use
a tight end upon occasion.

“We are going to the ‘‘Y"
because it has offensive po-
tential to put great pres-
sure on the defensive front
line. Our people fit a forma-
tion like that best. We saw
it used very effectively by
Wofford, for example."

The, key men in the Da-
vidson “Y’’ will be rising
seniors Mark Thompson and
(Mike (Mikolayunas.. ‘Mark

the perimeter of the de-
fense. The quarterback will

deal of the itme and Mark
can do that. He's a tough,
hard-nosed runner.

“Mark will step right in
Where Gordon Slade left off
and do a real good job for
us.

Plans now call for Miko
layunas to play both his
fullback position of last

year and at times the slot-
back position he filled as a
sophomore. ‘‘Mike is. as
good as anyone in the South-
ern Conference. We haven't
seen anyone better in the
entire state."

The arrival of Evans
Brown on the scene as an
assistant coach will mean
some changes in the Wild-
cat defensive sets this fall.
“Coach Brown has had a
lot of odd front experience
and has convinced me that
some of his ideas will work

best for us here,’ Fagg
said,
In addition to the odd

fronts, the defensive units
will switch back and fourth
from the college 43 to the
pro-type 4-3.

“Spring drills are a time
we really check fundament-
als."' Fagg added. ‘1970 is
not unlike 1960 or 1950, you
still have to
tackle to win ballgames.’!

“We want to get our of-
fense and our defense in for
the first game next fall.”
said Fagg. ‘‘We're going to
