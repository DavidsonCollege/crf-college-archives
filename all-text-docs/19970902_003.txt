U.S. News rankings too arbitrary to take seriously

The “Davidson — The Eighth
Wonder of the World” T-shirts can
once again be worn with confidence
in the accuracy of the statement.

After a two-year leave of ab-
sence, Davidson re-ascended to its
previous high of eighth place in the
most recent U.S. News and World
Report college rankings.

After falling to 21st two years
ago and then rising to 1 1th last year,
Davidson has again risen to No. 8.

At face value, our roller-coaster
ride through the rankings would
indicate that much has changed on
campus for the schdol to re-enter
the company of the liberal arts elite.

But Davidson’s recent yo-
yoing exposes the inherent flaws of
the U.S. News & World Report’s
system of ranking.

Most students would tell you

there hasn’t been much of a differ-
ence in the quality of education on
campus during the last four years..

Classes were just as well-taught
and demanding in 1995-96 — when
Davidson was pegged 21st — as in
the year before, when the school
was dubbed the nation’s eighth-best.

tors to academics, they should not
go totally unaccounted for in a
rankings-system-that-says it-can
differentiate between and choose
which colleges are the “best.”
Such an adjective is too broad
for rankings that significantly
weight its calculations toward a

Similarly,
the rankings do

= school’s finan-
‘<j cial resources
—/ and attempt to

not even take
into account quality of life — a
factor many students consider in
choosing a college. While
Swathmore might have better aca-
demics and a higher average SAT,
they also get maybe two months of
moderate weather ina typical school
year.

Why is such a possible deter-
minant not factored into the equa-
tion? Is that not a disadvantage?

- Eventhough the weather and school

location should be secondary fac-

judge the rather ambiguous category
of “academic reputation.”

The rankings do, though, help
indicate a few areas in which
Davidson can and should improve.
The college ranks 28th in faculty
resources — a number that com-
pares professors’ salaries, student-
to-faculty ratio, and class size.

Itis here where Davidson devi-
ates most significantly from its fi-
nal ranking. Many people would
agree that an improvement in this
area would lead to a better quality

of education. Higher professor sala- :
ries would attract and retain the best
talent: Smaller class sizes and lower
student to faculty ratio — in other
words, more professors — would
undoubtedly lead to a better, more
thorough academic environment.
The rankings’ saving grace is
that it judges all schools the same
way and is therefore fair and consis-
tent in that respect. Still, that only
means it succeeds in accurately com-

paring schools based on its ques-
tionable standards of what makes a
college the so-called best. ~

If anything, revisiting this mile-
stone should teach students and fac-
ulty that the second time is not so
much of a charm.

Given the school’s recent ex-
perience with the magazine, it is
doubtful that Davidson’s pride will ,
swell too much because of this year’s
particular number.
