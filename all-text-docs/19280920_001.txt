SPEAKS SEPTEMBER 12
Dr. Martin Clearly States That |

College is g No
Candidate or Party

Before an audience which filled and
overflowed Shearer Hall, Senator Joseph
T. Robinson, Democratic Vice-presiden- |
tial nominee, spoke to the=students and |
citizens of the. territory surrounding Da- |
vidson College, on Wednesday, Septem-
ber 12. Senator Rabinson came to Da-
vidson as a tribute to the greatest alum-
nus and Democratic leaden pVoodro
Wilson, r

Dr. Martin, president of the college in
introducing Chairman Jones, of the Coun-
ty Democratic Committee, stated definite-
ly that the college as an institution was
non-partisan but that the individuals of
the college would vote accotding to their
own sentiments.

In opening his address the Aviat
Senator took time to pay a tribute to the
service of this institution, and to give the
members of the student body some sound
philosophical advice,

Senator Robinson took as’ the task of
his speech the defense of his fellow can-
didate against three charges which he felt
were entertained against Alfred E. Smith
in the South. Paying a magnificent trib-
ute to the personality of the Democraic
candidate, the Senator, after establishing

-an axiomatic truth, defended charges
made against Smith as a Catholic. Going
back to the foundations of the American
government, he urged that religious dis-
tinctions should not be made in the goy-
ernment of the land,

The second charge against which he de-
fended Al Smith was that of his supposed
antagonism to the public school system.
For his proof in this line he went back
over the development of the public school
system in the State of New York during
the eight years of Smith's: administration,
showing the remarkable improvements
made in schools, teachers’ salaries, and
methods. At this point in his speech he
scored an applause-evoking hit against
the Hoover-Democrat.

The Senator then turned to the defense
of Smith’s connection with Tammany
Hall. Going through the history of Tam-
many he presented the institution as one
of Democratic and noble principles. He
maintained that he would rather have in
power in the United States a man who
could dominate Tammany Hall rather
than a man who would be dominated by
thieves such as corrupted the Harding
administration,

In closing the Arkansan asserted that
one could not look back over the past
eight ‘years of national corruption and
repudiate Smith in the name of honest
government.

SPLENDID MEN TO

REV. WOODS IS FIRST
“y” SPEAKER OF YEAR

“The Fighting Instinct” was the theme
of the address delivered by the Rev. Ed-
gar A. Woods, pastor of the First Pres-
byterian Church of Salisbury, Sunday at
the first Y. M. C, A; of
the year.

Taking as his text a portion of the
seventh verse of the fourth chapter
Second Timothy, “I have fought a ood
fight,” he stressed the importance of the
combative tendency in real life. Every
healthy person has within his being this
instinct to fight ;. therefore it is not strange
that Paul, the apostle of love, should take
many of his figures of speech from the
field of warfare,

When Paul was speaking of his strug-
gle with life he spoke of it as a good fight
and not as a disorderly brawl. His fight
had been lifted from the low plane of
physical controversy to the high plane of
spiritual conflict and victory. Starting
with the cravings of greed actuating his
action he ended with a high moral pur-
pose.

There are two great fields where Chris-
tian men must fight if they would attain
real character. A man’s personal life is a
constant strugglé against temptation, for
the type of goodness that comes without
effort is spineless and of no avail in fac-
ing real problems. Many men need this
fighting instinct in facing moral questions
which have constantly kept their lives in
the shadow of indecision and unrest. The
moral coward may be a physical giant
and with all the daring necessary for ath-
letic prowess yet he lacks the courage to
face the facts of his past lifé and settle
them through the aid of Jesus Christ.

The fighting instinct is needed in the
world at large as well as in personal ‘life,
The business man who conducts his busi-
ness enterprise on higher standards than
those of his competitors has a real fight
on his hands. The young man who de-
termines to hold onto his ideals regardless
of. what others may say has a harder
Struggle on his hands than if he were
asked to face an enemy battle line.

There are three attitudes which are
taken toward this good fight of which
Paul speaks, according to Mr. Woods.
The cynical, destructive, Menckenesque
attitude may be one of these, yet a person
of this type never offers anything con-
structive to take the place of what, he has
ridiculed. The second attitude, to ignore
the existence of any struggle, does not ap-
peal to any red-blooded man; and thus
only the third is left. This is that of the
young Christian who contends willingly
and eagerly for his ideals and who can
say with Paul at the end of life that he

has kept the faith.

COLLEGE RE-OPENS
FOR NINETY-THIRD
SESSION, SEPT. 12

Five Hundred and Ninety-Seven
Men Matriculated to Date

\, LARGE FRESHMEN CLASS

Large Senior Class of Last Year
Leaves Great Number of Va-

cancies for New Men

One week ago today Davidson College
entered upon its ninety-third year of active
to the youth the Southland.
In the Freshman class there ate register-
ed 258 students, the largest number in the
history of the college since 1923, at which
time. the enrollment was 260. Of the 258
registered for the present session only 226
have matriculated, The larger portion of
the remaining 32 is expected on the cam-
pus in a few days. The reason given for
so large a Freshman class is that a large
number of Seniors were graduated last
spring, leaving room for a larger number
of new men.

Of the total number matriculated, which
is 597, besides the

service of

226 which are Fresh-
there are 118 Seniors, 114 Juniors,
134 Sophomores. There are four special
students, and one graduate student work-
ing toward a M.A. degree.

The total number enrolled smaller
due to the fact that a greater number of
upper-classmen who had registered failed
to matriculate than had been calculated.

Because ofthe high interest in the No-
vember election of the President, College
Humor and all the American college
journals have planned a nation-wide straw
vote to determine the voting preference
on the two candidates.

All college students, regardless of age,
are asked to vote. The complete student
opinion is of much more interest than just
the votes of those students who are of
voting_age, because it can then be deter-
mined what the college world thinks. of
the two candidates.

Herbert Hoover, the Republican can-
didate, was born in West Branch, Iowa.
He received his degree in engineering at
Leland Stanford University in 1895 and
has since been honored by 27 other uni-
versities. He held the position of Food
Conservator during President Wilson's

term.
Alfred E. Smith, the Democraic candi-
date, was born in New York City. He

started his varied and successful career
as newsboy and became one of New
York's leading men. He has been elected
Governor of New York State four times,
and has a personality that is rare.

The ballots will be distributed Friday
night and it is hoped by those in charge
that all. students will register their vote
and leave the ballot in a conspicuous place
in their rooms for collection the next day.

Many Changes Made
In The Davidsonian

As The Davidsonian makes its first ap-
pearance of the year today several strik-
ing changes will be noticed in the general
make-up of the paper. In an attempt to
improve the style and smartness of David-
son’s weekly student publication, the edi-
tor and staff have decided to make con-
siderable change from previous issues.

In the physical set-up of The David-
sonian it will be noticed that six pages of
six columns each are being used instead of
eight pages of five columns each as last
year. The standard newspaper columns
of 13 picas has been adopted to facilitate
the composition of headlines and advertis-
ing. A vital change in the outside ap-
pearance of the publication has
brought about by the replacement of the
old title cut by straight type.

The news gathering agencies of the
paper will be highly departmentalized this
year, Sport? features, society, and alumni
news will each be handled through sep-
