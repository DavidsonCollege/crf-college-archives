On the sports front

By JOHN BURNS

Before you read this column
please read the letter to the editor
sent by Coach Boettcher. Now, if
you're ready, I will let loose a tirade
unrivaled in human history.

Just kidding. But really, since
this is the second letter sent to this
paper dealing with this issue, I
thought you would really just love
to hear what I had to say about it.

First of all, what’s the big deal? I
have always read and in some in-
stances referred to women’s teams
as The Lady Raiders or The Lady
Wildcats. I was under the assump-
tion that female athletes were glad
not to be confused with their male
counterparts. Go ahead, call one of
them a guy and sce what happens.
Also, I’m proud that we are able to.
refer to our women athletes as la-
dies; go. to Queens and sce what |
mean. This paper has made a con-
scious effort to be egalitarian in its
headlines; last week’s soccer article
said “men’s soccer stomps one then
tics one,” rather than just plain
“soccer,” as though only men play
the real sport.

Second, and this is more in re-
sponse to Lucia Kendall’s letter, is it
really desirable for us to havea sexu-
ally homogeneous society? If so,
then I take issue with Ms. Kendall's
treatment of men as sex objects in
her latest Ietter (sce the opinions
page). | would much rather live ina
world where women and men knew
that they were different and treated
each other as such. PLEASE NOTE:
] am in no way condoning sexual
discrimination, I am merely saying
that life is nicer in a world where
people can be different and equal at
the same time.

I see no correlation between
calling a female a girl and referring
toa black male as “boy.” To me, the
attitude behind the language is what
is important. The term “boy” re-

Tired of the gender deal

‘over to the Baker Complex and

flected a hatred and a warped view
of humanity which should be
fought wherever it is found. Refer-
ring to women as “girls” is the
modern equivalent of “guys”. I am
sorry Lucia, but “gals” went out
with poodle skirts and sock-hops.
This is why children are referred to
aslittle girls. Again, the intention of
the speaker is what is important; if
the guy who wrote the “Freshman
girl’s Bible study” poster didn’t
mean to insult females, why should
any offense be taken?

Finally, with the possible ex-
ception of jousting, it is easy to run
out of termsinanarticle. Especially
one written by é an amateur reporter
like myself or a member of my staff.
There is a cardinal rule in journal-
ism: avoid redundancy. If attitudes
such as Coach Boettcher’s prevent
me from using a certain termin one
of my articles, that article willbe; __
come redundant. Try inserting the
term “team” for every reference to
that team, and see how the article
flows, it just doesn’t.

I know that I may not survive
the weck, but that’s the breaks.
Meanwhile, afew more thou ghts....

AmItheonly one who wonders
why we build a gymnasium with
4,500 more seats than wecan filland
then regulate how many students
(the only fans thatregularly come to
games) can get good seats?

I admire Coach McKillop’s de-
sire for rabid fans, but that rabidity

‘will be redticed if'you have to'watk ‘©

faa

stand in line for tickets the day be-
fore the game. If the ticket policy is
a first come, first serve policy, why
can’t they just give the good seats to
those who show their ID first at the
game?

I hope that Davidson students
get up in arms about this stupid de-
cision. Come on, let’ s make this the
Football Controversy of 1990.

Cross-country performs
well at N.C. meet

By CARTER PAYNE

The Davidson cross-country team
ranin Wilmington last Thursday in The
North Carolina Collegiate State Meet.
All of the Wildcat runners turned in
good performances, allowing
Davidson to place sixth out of a total of
12 teams.

Sophomore Chris Otrok led all
Davidson runners in the five mile race
by placing 23rd out of more than 100
runners with a time of 27:04.

Ian Stewart was second best for the

Wildcats, coming in at 45th with a time
of 28:01. Ted Richardson was third for
Davidson, and he was followed by Jay
Clugston. ae

The exceptional effort turned in by
the entire team was good enough to
overcome tough foes such as East Caro-
lina and Wake Forest's B team, both
opponents which the Wildcats ‘had
never beaten.

Congratulations to all members of
the team fora fantastic effortand a good
showing against North Carolina’s best.
