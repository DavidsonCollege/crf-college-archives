Every word of God is pure: He is a shield unto

them that put their trust in Him. Prov. 30:5.

. We mourn the passing of Dr. T. W. Lingle. In
his life at Davidson he has made many student
and faculty friends. His place will be hard to
fill. THE DAVIDSONIAN joins in extending
sincerest sympathy to his family and more inti-
mate friends.

of Omicron Delta Kappa.

MASQUERS CO-OPERATE ... There is no
stofy in this issue of “The Davidsonian” con-
cerning the Masquers’ prospective play, “The
Bishop Misbehaves,” and for good reason.
Dunny Covington, president of the players,
v says that the play has been given up for good.
Due to the fact that the local dramatists are
needed so greatly both by Miss Palmer and
Mr. Viehman in their respective pageants,
they will give their whole-hearted co-oper-
ation toward these enterprises.

Push Pageant ....

Most of us rather unconsciously associate
the word “pageant” with those grammar
school productions replete with milling chil-
dren, nervous teachers, proud parents and
yards cheese-cloth. Therefore we were
pleasantly surprised to hear Mr, Viehman’s
plans for our Centennial production.

He made it apparent that a pageant IS
something worthy of adult efforts, that it can
be made a_real contribution, a worthy pres-

of

entation of our history. A great deal of
credit is due Mr. Viehman and the members
of the FACULTY COMMITTEE for the

amount of work already done. The script
alone must have involved endless research and
careful inquiry into the past. Other details
have been as carefully arranged.

From time to time’in the past.we have
urged student co-operation in this effort. The
time has come—no one who heard the talk
Monday night can fail to be interested. And
interest will certainly be cumulative. Success
or failure is dependent upon student help.
There is a job for everyone. None of us should
be bashful about offering our services. For

The college freshman sez: and
the co-ed replies:

He—Honey, what pretty eyes you

She—The better to see you with.

Counting sheep has long been a
highly touted method usedxby con-
firmed somnambulists for dropping
off to sleep Now law students at
Ohio State University count words
of lectures for the opposite reason
—to stay awake.

The driest lectures have the stu-
dents closest attention—all because
they make bets on how many times
the professor will use certain com-

mon words such as “the,” “or” and
“however.”

Apologies to Tennyson—

All over their insteps stumbled and

Another Famous Poem—
Drink to me only with thine eyes,

Now that we're all more or less
rested up from the holidays, we still
have a little left to look forward to
before vacation rolls around, name-
ly fraternity houseparties and the
Bowery Ball. Don’t know’ just why
they call it “Bowery” Ball; that’s
almost as far-fetched as Junior
“Speaking.” Nobody wears clothes
reminiscent of the bowery; Bed-
lam Ball would come nearer to hit-
ting it. Or Morganton Merrymak-
ing. Anyway, we predict that there
will be at least three boys in red
flannel underwear, six with suits on
backwards, and several dozen with
hats too small for them. It never
fails.

They tell me that men are con-
sidered brave and fine if they are
willing merely to die for the land
of their birth. With a rueful glance
at a useless limb, I laugh at such a
trifling sacrifice. The real heroes,
my friends, are the ones who
cheerfully submit to a typhoid shot
to make the world safe for democ-
racy. Take a look at that left arm.
See that big red spot that looks’
like a map of Ohio? That’s patri-
otism for you! Next time I think
I'll just take the fever and let the
serum go. Rather be shot with a
gun than a needle any day. You

Too bad the only good local fire
in five years had to happen while
most of the student body was away
from the campus. Funny how these
things go in groups.. Seems the
local fire department was over on
Mill Hill trying to put out another
fire when the main one. started,
and that while the Mooresville de-
partment was on its way over to
lend a helping hand, a fire broke
out in that neighboring metropolis.
And, while this is a bit too much
for my suspicious mind, that while
the Salisbury truck was on its way
to help out in Mooresville, a fire
broke out in Salisbury too. States-
