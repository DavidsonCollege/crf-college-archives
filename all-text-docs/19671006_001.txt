Student Ideas

By BILL SEIGLER
Associate Editor

Complete representation of
all legitimate opinions, es
pecially student views, con
cerning the fraternity pro
posals was requested today
by the man who will lead
trustee discussion on the is
sue at their fall meeting next
weekend.

Harllee Branch, Jr.. a
member of the Class of ‘27
who became a trustee in
1961, is chairman of the
Trustee Campus and Social
Life Committee which will
make recommendations to the
full board about the frater
nity question.

“We're going to try to get
as much of a cross section of
viewpoints as possible before
making recommendations,”
he said. Once these views are
presented, ‘‘we will grapple
with the question as objec-
tively as we can. I hope that
no constructive view fails to
reach us."

Branch said that although
the members of his commit-
tee last spring ‘“‘generally
favored the proposed affilia-
tion plan,” several questions
were raised as to whether it
was the best possible plan.

They questioned whether
‘a program that compulsarily
provided affiliation wouldn't
be even worse than the pres-
ent system,” he said.

It was finally decided to
delay action until fall, Branch
explained, so ‘‘all interested
groups on campus could give
us the benefit of their views."

Several members of ihe
college administration have
expressed confidence in
Branch. Tom Covington, as-
sistant director of the Col-
lege Union and fraternity
liaison officer, commented on
Branch's broadmindedness
on college issues.

“He takes a global ap-
proach to student activities,”
Covington said. ‘‘He's inter-
ested in the whole of campus
life, from the campus frater-
nity situation to the Union
and dormitories.’

A Presbyterian elder,
Branch received his law de-
gree from Emory in 1931 and
is currently president of the

Southern Company. He is al
so a member of the board of
directors of General Motors,
U. S. Steel and several other
major companies.

While at Davidson, Branch
was a member of Beta Theta
Pi and was interested in ac
tivities ranging from the
Student Council to basketball.
He was editor of THE DA
VIDSONIAN and member of
Omicron Delta Kappa.

Faculty To Get
Plan On Tuesday

By JIM COOLEY
Staff Writer

A compromise solution to Davidson's fraternity
affiliation dilemmashas been drafted by the presidents
of the college's 12' national fraternities and will be
submitted to the faculty at its Tuesday afternoon

meeting.

The new proposal calls for an extended rush pro-
gram for those not receiving bids during the formal

rushing period.

Trustees To Study
Fraternity Proposal

By BOB TRAVERS
Associate Editor

The Board of Trustees is
scheduled to consider the
total fraternity affiliation
question and the curriculum
revision question at their fall
meetings next Thursday and
Friday.

*‘Just what they will decide
nobody can say,"’ said an ad-
ministration spokesman.

The curriculum revision
question has grown out of the
work of the Blue Sky Com-
mittee and its various sub-

committees which
formed last fall.

The committee as a whole
issued a preliminary report
on its work last spring.

The Education Committee
of the trustees met. with the
Blue Sky Committee two
weeks ago so that the Edu-
cation Committee will be able
to brief the rest of the trus-
tees when the question comes

tee will make recommenda-

New Handbooks
To Be Delivered

The Student Organization
Handbook should be distribut-
ed by the end of the week,
according to Bruce Weihe,
chairman of the Student
Council ‘subcommittee _ re-
sponsible for its publication.

Weihe said that he had
given the manuscript of the
handbook to Russell A.
Strong, director of public in-
formation, on Sept. 27 and
had hoped to have it out by
Oct. 3. No explanation was
offered by Strong's office for
the delay.

Weihe described the hand-
book as being “primarily for

the freshman."’ The book con-

tains information on all of the
student organizations on cam
pus, as well as the Student
Bedy Constitution.

The book contains informa.
tion pertaining to all 12 fra-
ternities, the student govern.
ment groups such as the IFC
and the Social Council, the
various honorary _ societies
and the special interest
groups.

A Student Council sub
committee of Weihe, Peter
Hobbie and Ben Cannon was
responsible for writing the
handbook, while the Public
Information Office handled
the printing.

tions for the consideration of
the full board. No such rec
ommendations have been
made public, however.

Action on the fraternity
question was delayed at the
last meeting of the board—in
the spring—because the trus
tees wanted more time to
consider the question.

According to the original
plan submitted by the fra.
ternity” ~ presidents, each
rushee would receive one of
two types of invitations to
social affiliation.

With a type “A” bid, the
rushee might become a per
manent social affiliate or
he might pledge the frater
hity.

The type “B"’ bid would of
fer social affiliation—but not
necessarily on a permanent
basis or at the fraternity of
the rushee’s choice.

At the end of two-month
intervals, the holder of a
type ‘“B"' bid would have. the
option of requesting another
fraternity.

The national secretaries of
10 Davidson fraternities drew
up an alternate plan and pre
sented it to the administra
tion two weeks ago. This plan
proposes an extended rush
for rushees who do not re
ceive regular bids.

This week the fraternity
presidents offered a com
promise between their old
plan and the nationals’ plan.

The proposal was submitted
to the faculty committee on
the College Union, Fraterni
ties and Social Life last Tues
day for their consideration
before its presentation to the
faculty as a whole.

All 12 of the fraternities
voted on and approved the
proposal this week, several
by a unanimous vote.

Under the proposed solu
tion, formal rush will take
place the first week of sec
ond semester and will be
basically like the February.
1967 rush.

Every rushee will receive
six suggested date cards and
will receive redates with at
least two fraternities. Stu-
dents who do not receive two
redates will be provided with

The idea of type ‘‘A’’ and
“B" bids has been dropped.
A rushee may accept either
a bid to enter the fraternity
as a pledge or an invitation to
enter the program of extend
ed rush, the crux of the new
proposal.

Only those rushees who do
not receive a bid are to be
eligible for entrance into the
extended rush program.
Those remaining unbid and
expressing a desire to enter
the extended rush program
will be divided up among the
fraternities by matching as
closely as possible the pref
erences of the rushees with
the preferences of the fra
ternity presidents,

The invitations for extend
ed rush are then to be issued
at the same time as bids, and
acceptance of the invitations
are to be made in the same
manner as acceptance of
bids

Those rushees entering the
extended rush program have

Student Council To Poll
Marrieds About Housing

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

The Student Council decid
ed Tuesday to send question
naires to all married students
at Davidson College to deter
mine if there is a demand
for the college to furnish them
with more adequate housing.

The questions concerned
such things as living condi-
tions, rent, difficulty of lo
cating housing, convenience
and desirability of having
new housing, possibly similar
to the recently constructed
faculty duplex.

The questionnaire also
asked if the student wives
felt that enough campus ac
tivities were provided for
them to eccupy their spare
time.

Senior council member
Mike May reported his con

Scholar
Is Detained
In India

Luigi Carlo Simonelli, the
Richardson Scholar from In
dia who has not yet arrived
at Davidson, apparently will
not come to the school this
semester, according to group
adviser Dr. John Kelton.

Kelton said that Simonelli
was having trouble in obtain
ing permission to take the
funds necessary for the trip
out of the country. Kelton
said that his last letter be
fore school started had ex
pressed hope for obtaining
the necessary permission

According to Kelton, Simon
elli will apparently not ar
rive on campus this semes
ter. However Kelton is hope
ful that he will be able to
come for the second semes

versation with several mar
ried students and said the
consensus of these students
was that the housing was
“livable, but not very good.”

Bill Watson told the coun
cil he had arranged the first
of a series of ‘practical sym
posia.”’ It will be held Nov.
1, with Dr. Randall R. Kin
caid, assistant professor of
economics, leading a discus
sion on investments.

Bruce, Weihe was named
chairman of a five-man com
mittee which will conduct an
investigation of the possibili
ty of allowing girls in the
dormitories during special
weekends and possibly at
other times.

President Tom Earnhardt
volunteered to head a com
mittee to investigate the pos-

as ressan,

sibility of providing a better
lighting system on campus.

The council elected Danny
Layman to the Library Com
mittee.

Revision Group
Pares Constitution

The Constitution Revision
Committee moved toward a
decisively shorter and more
general student constitution
in its meeting Thursday night.

The committee agreed that
major sections of the sum
mer draft of the new consti
tution should be transferred
to the by-laws, in order to
leave the new student govern
ment more room for adapta
tion.

Support, Approval | Nesded

For Residence Hall Council

The proposed Residence
Hall Council is in an appar
ent state of limbo.

Faculty appreval and for
mal Student Council approv
al are necessary before the
council can be elected. The
Board of Trustees, however,
gave the constitution of the
council an informal approval
last spring.

Mrs. Peter Nicholls, super
visor of dormitories, said
Wednesday she hoped that
approval would be forthcom-
ing and that the council
would be organized shortly.

The purpose of the council
is to strengthen or replace
the Student Regulations
Board of the Student Coun-

cil and to provide more ef
fective dromitory govern
ment.

If the council is created in
fact, it will be composed of
nine or 10 students. A presi
dent and a vice president
will be elected along with
representatives from each
dorm

Belk, the largest dormi
tory on campus, will be al
lotted two representatives.

Under the Residence Hall
Council constitution, each
floor of each dorm will elect
a member to serve on special
dorm committees.

As an example, one com-
mittee might plan special
activities for its dorm, such

as discussion groups. In ad-
dition, elected representa-
tives will serve as an advi-
sory board from matters in-
volving violations of house
regulations.

The council might consi-
der and lobby for the con-
struction of study rooms and
dorm reception rooms. At
present only Belk, Richard-
son and Little. dorms have
any sort of rooms where
dates or visitors may enter.

There has been speculation
that the Residence Hall
Council might formulate
plans for having open dorms
at specified times at which
women might be entertained
in dorm rooms.
