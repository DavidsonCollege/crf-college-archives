REPLIES EVASIVE

POW Alumnug’ Plight Uncertain

By DICK ANDERSON
Associate Editor

Davidson graduates have
had varied post - commence-
ment lives: one published a
nudie magazine, one became
Secretary of State and one
has been a prisoner of war
for the past five years.

Porter Halyburton, °63,

married a Queens College co-
ed and became a Navy pilot.
While flying a reconnaissance
mission over North Vietnam
in October, 1965, he was shot
down. j

“I received the first in-
formation that he was still
alive in February, 1967, a
year and four months after
he was shot down,” said

his wife, Mrs. Marty Haly-
burton.

Mrs. Halyburton is small
and blonde and appears fra-
gile, her eyebrows arching
in a china-doll face. She has
a five-year-old daughter nam-
ed Dabney, whom her hus-
band saw only shortly before
he went with his ship to the
Tonkin Gulf.

Danforth Lecturer Will
Deal With Conservation

John J. A. McLaughlin, an

eminent oceanologist and .

ecologist, will deliver three
lectures as a Danforth Visit-
ing Lecturer next week.

His presentations are ‘‘Con-
servation and Pollution” at
10 a. m. Monday and ‘‘The
Ecology of the Future” at
10 a.m. Tuesday, both in the
Morrison Room, and ‘‘Con-
temporary Conservation: The
Marine and Fresh ‘Water En-

vironment” at 7:30 p.m. in
Chambers 228.

McLaughlin is chairman of
the Department of Biological
Sciences and director of the
Louis Calder Conservation

and Ecology Center at Ford-
ham University.

He has received important
research and facilities grants
from the U..S. Public Health
Service and the National
Science Foundation and has
written over 55 publications
in Marine ’ phytoplanktology
and ecology.

‘The. visiting lecture pro-
gram is sponsored by the
Danforth Foundation to assist
colleges in strengthening lib-
eral education, Each year
several people of high intel-
lectual statute from both the
U.S. and abroad are made
available to colleges through
the program.

ent collection of the Mint
‘Museum in Charlotte, where
it will be shown, along with
other new art recently ac-

quired by the museum,
starting Oct. 25.

“Birth 4," a charcoal
piece, was among ten en-

tries, out of 500 total works
submitted, which were given
“purchase awards’’ by the
museum. Judging was done
by an independent profes-
sional art critic.

Freed's art is no stranger
to Davidson students and fa-
culty: “I had about twenty
Paintings in last year's stu-
dent art show in Cham-
bers,"’ said Ken, ‘‘Several of
of them were purchased."

He will have a personal
showing in the ‘Chambers
foyer ‘sometime the end of
this month.”’

Freed also painted the
wall mural in the dining
room of the Sigma Phi Epsi-
lon fraternity house,

Ken, who calls his work
“abstract expressionist,’’ is
currently working on a ‘‘se-
ries of paintings involved in
abstract landscapes.’ He
presently works in acrylics,
woodcuts, and ‘‘all kinds of
drawing media.’*

His paintings, Ken says,
“have evolved from when I
was younger—from impres-
sionism to more abstract
forms."’ They have had
plently of time and chance
for__evolution:. Ken did his
first oil painting at the age
of 13; wat 17 he was the
youngest antist to ever have
a personal exhibit at the Ci-
vic Art Center in his home-
town of Battle Creek, Michi-
gan.

Ken's plans for the im-
mediate future include ex-
‘hibits “at Southeastern” Gal-
lery of Contemporary Art in
Winston-Salem, until the end
of this month, and next
spring at the Spring Art
(Contest and Show in Lan-
caster, S. C,

(He also hopes to have a

‘painting in the’ North Caro-

lina Annual Art Show in Ra-
leigh in December and Jan-
uary, although he says that
“it’s not a_ sure thing,’!
since the works to be shown
are chosen by a judge, much
the same as the Mint Mu-
seum competition.

“One of the biggest things”
—she would not say ‘‘worst”
in describing her reaction to
her husband's captivity—'‘is
not knowing for so long
whether he is well, not know-
ing anything about his con-
dition.”

Three letters have come
from .North Vietnam; short
and bland, they tell only that
he is well and ask about her
and the daughter he barely
knows. According to returh-
ed prisoners with whom Mrs.
Halyburton has_ spoken, so
much is all their captors~al-
low the prisoners to write.

“I just sont of live each

day at a time,” she explain-

ed, ‘because I have no idea
when to expect him back.”

Yet Mrs. Halyburton would
not @ay much about how she
felt “I have a small child
and hobbies to keep me
busy.” Instead she stressed
the isolation and hardship
which her husband ‘under-
goes.

“The only medical treat-
ment they get is what’s ab-
solutely necessary to keep
them alive,” she said of the
prisoners. ‘‘Their diet is poor,
and they’re constantly sub-
ject to mental and physical
tortures,

“I’ve had a way to occupy
my time, but Porter has had
virtually nothing. He’s been
deprived of everything.”

One of the chief ways Mrs.

Halyburton has occupied her-
self has been activity in the
National League of Families
of American Prisoners and
Missing in Southeast Asia.

‘We got started a year and
a half ago,” she said, ‘‘when
President Nixon and Defense
Secretary Laird gave us the
go-ahead. Before it was felt
that there might be reper-

.Cussions against our hus-

bands, but now that seems
unlikely.”

Mrs. Halyburton said the
group had two main pur-
poses, to put pressure on the
North Vietnamese to release
the prisoners and to get them
to observe the Geneva Con-
vention on treatment. of
prisoners of war.

“IT came to Davidson to get
Students to write letters to
the North Vietnamese gov-
ernment. and negotiators in
Paris, te show there was
concern in this country about
the prisofiers,” she said.

“This isa strictly humani-

tarian concern; we feel that
it transcends the issue of the
war,”
