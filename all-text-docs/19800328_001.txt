Dave Waddill was the victor in Wednesday’s runoff for the SGA

votes discovered

A discrepancy of 234 ballots
in yesterday’s SGA presidential
election aroused in some stu-
dents ‘‘serious doubts of the
credibility of the election (pro-
cess),’’ said SGA President
John Jackson.

Jackson decided not to hold
another election because he saw
the election process as ‘‘fair”
and in no way different from
any previous elections held here
at Davidson.

The problem arose Tuesday
evening when two supporters of
Robert Bowie, Steve Austin
and Harold Lloyd asked that
the ballot total be compared
with the names crossed out in
the election directories. Their
results found 745 crossed-out
names in the directories but 979
total ballots cast.

Austin and Lloyd said they
investigated the results because
they had heard during the day
that Bowie had been running
ahead of second place finisher
Richard Terry.

Jobs, careers, up inthe air

The entire Davidson athletic
department is being quietly
reorganized, and no one, not
even the people directly affec-
ted, really knows about it.

There will be no Athletic
Director next year, according to
Vice President for Academic
Affairs Price Zimmermann. In-
stead, the department will be
split in twocand headed by a
Intercollegiate Athletics Direc-
tor and a Physical Education
Director both responsible direc-
tly to the Vice President for
Academic Affairs.

. Present Athletic Tom Cart-
mill, who resigned two weeks
ago, will become Physical Edu-
cation Director, responsible for
' “fall physical education and
intramural athletics,”’ said Zim-
mermann.

Sterling Martin, who is now
Director of Physical Education
and Intramurals, will become
head cross country coach and
direct lake campus operations.

Zimmermann said the college
is now looking for the new

Presidency.

Waddill received 478 votes to Richard Terry’s 304. The runoff
was held because Waddill failed to reach a majority in Tuesday’s
elections. He gained 482 votes, while Richard Terry received 270

and Robert Bowie 227.

Waddill, a junior history
major, based his campaign
largely on student involvement
in the SGA, citing the Trustee
Contact Committee and the
Student Admissions Team as
examples of a working student
government. —

Waddill said he plans:to work
for more student participation
in Davidson’s Development
Programs as well as in the
Trustee letter writing cam-
paign.

He also wants to improve job
opportunities for students
through increased internship
programs and an improved
corporate relationship for Da-
vidson.

running for office this year

By JOHN SIMAN

Séveral soccer players claim
that Assistant Football Coach
Tom Miller ordered»the club
soccer team off a practice field
Friday in an ‘‘extremely con-
descending and rude manner.”

“T just asked some people to
leave the football field,” Miller
said, later adding, ‘‘very pol-
litely.”’

Immediately after Miller told
them to leave, ‘‘a bunch of
isolated shouting matches star-
ted,’’ between soccer players
and three assistant football
coaches, according to John
Jackson, club soccer player.

Jackson emphasized that
neither Head Coach Ed Farrell
nor any football players were
involved in the incident.

The soccer players had been
playing on the field by the
entrance to the cross. country
course for about an hour and a
half Friday afternoon. The field
is designated for football prac-
tice, according to Farrell. How-
ever, ‘Intramural Director Ster-
ling Martin said he had given

a the soccer players permission to

use the field, though the foot-
ball team had “‘priority use.”

Minor sports in a squeeze

By MARVIN OVERBY

Minor sports budgets for
next year will not be cut as part
of the $85,000 athletic budget
reduction, according to Vice
President for Academic Affairs,
Price Zimmerman.

However, inflation and alrea-
dy inadequate funding may
cancel the significance of this
degision for many minor sports
coaches.

Zimmerman said sports bud-
gets will remain as they were
this year. | cuts will be
made in ‘‘administration and
maintenance,” and the ‘“‘consol-

idation of personnel,” including
a freeze on purchases of auto-
mobiles and office equipment, a
new insurance policy which
ends duplication of existing
family policies, a $5,000 cut in
football recruting, and ‘‘over-
lap” in coaching positions.

“No college of our size can
afford one-sport coaches,’’ Zim-
merman said. “Coaches will be
told of any new responsibilities
as soon as possible.’’'

“I don’t anticipate any signi-
ficant effect on minor sports,”

Zimmerman said, ‘‘The present
minor sports budgets are ade-
quate.”

Even if money is taken from
the sports budgets, inflation

coaches have revealed a “wait
