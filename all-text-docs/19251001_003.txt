Bill Woods—“Have you seen the new

| Heber—“What’s it called?”

Bill—“The automobile flop.”

Heber—“What is it, a sort of tango?”

Bill—“No. Just an old-fashioned break-
down.”

FIRE!

Mag—"I broke my engagement with

him because he wouldn't give up to-
bacco.”
Hag—"“Then he’s an old flame of

yours?”
Mag—"Yes, and he’s still smoking.”

Judge—‘Now why did you permit this
man to rob a bank on your beat?”

Cop—“Well, yer honor, I asked the
man what he was doing in the neighbor-
hod and he said he was going to open a
bank a little later, and Judge, he may be
a thief, but he was no liar.”

| “You know,” said the lady whose motor
jear had run down a man, “you must
‘have been driving very carelessly. I am
}a very careful driver, I have been driv-
| ing a car for seven years.’

“Lady, you've got nothing on me.

Doctor—“Did you open both windows
_ before going to bed as I specified?”
| Fresh Flinn—“No sir. There was only
| one window, so I opened it twice.”

Daughter—“Papa, what is your birth-
stone?”

Father of seven—“My dear, I’m not
sure, but I think it is a grindstone.”

Hebe McIlwaine says he spent the
summer way back in the country, and
was supposed to work hard, but luck
seemed to come his way. He had some
trees to cut down, and the day before he
was to do it a cyclone came along and
blew them all down, then the lightning
set fire to the brush pile after he had
rcorded the wood. After all this work
was done for him he got lazy and sat
around for two weeks waiting for an
earthquake to come along and shake the
potatoes out of the ground.

“Hello, Brown, how are you?”

“I am very well, thank you, but I want
you to know that my name is not Brown.
It is Green.”

“Green? Oh yes, pardon me. I

SPITS OR SPITZ

New York, “but may I inquire what kind
of a dog that is?”

“Certainly,” replied the Boston maid.
“He is an expectorator.”

“Indeed!” exclaimed the young man.
“IT don’t think I ever heard of the breed.”

“No doubt,” rejoined the fair owner.
He is what you would call a Spitz.”

AND A HAIRCUT

“Mamma,” said little Elsie, “do college
men ever go to Heaven?” |

“Why, of course, my dear. What makes |
you ask?” |

“Because I never sce any pictures of
angels with whiskers.”

“Well, said the mother, thoughtfully,
some of them do go to Heaven, but they
get there by a close shave.”

Of course we don’t mean to give any |
names, but a certain Junior called Nor-
wood fell in love this past summer, Just

NICE AND COLD
They went riding after the party,
And the night was very cold;
He didn’t attempt to keep her warm
For fear she'd think him bold.
“Are you nice and warm?”
The laddie asked her twice.
And with chattering teeth
She said, “At least I’m nice!”

JAYBIRDSVILLE

A traveling salesman, being compelled
to stay over night in Davidson, accosted |
the Cop Johnson and put him to query: |

“Can you tell me when the theatre |
opens?”

“No,” replied the officer, “we have no |
thentre? |

“Well, the music hall, then?” continued |
the traveler.

“No, no, there’s nothing of the kind |
here,” was the policeman’s retort.

His questioner gave vent to an
‘| astonished gasp. |

“Goodness me!” he exclaimed |
“Haven’t you any amusement at all in
this town?”

“Yes,” replied the policeman, “if you
wait. up until eight o'clock you'll see them
‘switching trains.”

Abie—“Fader, dere iss a customer in der

Father—“Does it fit heem?”

Abie—“No, it iss too large.”

Father—“Vell, it vill shrink.”
