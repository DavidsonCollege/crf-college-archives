THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1991

Beyond Birkenstock:

Another Offering of B.S. (Birk Sagicity, that is)

Hey, we’ve been up on Mt.
Sinai getting column topics from
God (Moses took the new picture)
and guess what? (Rhetorical ques-
tion; Do Not Answer) This was
Numero Uno on the Really Top
Ten Humor Columns for this
millenium. (Hey, we thought it
was dumb too, but like Jake and
Elwood, “we’re ona mission from
Gahhd.”)

In the tradition of great pla-
garists such as Sen. Joe Biden,
Vanilla Ice, and those shadowy
figures the Honor Council is al-
ways shipping home, we bring you
this column. Now this isn’t that
petty stealing of words or bass
lines; we are instead co-opting an
idea (just like what we did with our
Top Fifteen last year). The differ-
ence, of course, is honesty. We’re
honestly going to “steal” aconcept
from a major publication without
the expressed written consent of
Major League Baseball. We never
claimed to be original, but hey ...
you already knew that.

Anyway, in case one or two of
you Nintendo-Heads_ reads
Newsweck, you should recognize
this immediately. But rather than
call itCW (Conventional Wisdom),
we’ ll alter it slightly to reflect how
much we think of ourselves and
call it BS (Birk Sagacity). And for
the comedians among you, that
last phrase is notan oxymoron. So,

enjoy.

Khrushchev: Nick has taken
a serious turn for the nether re-
gions of BS. He sure does look
silly for telling our grandparents
that we’d grow up Commies. On
second thought, some of you are .
.. he’s holding steady.

Lenin: You would think that
Lenin’s BS rating would

is looking old and tired. Perhaps
some pastels would help his im-
age, or maybe what he needs is a
coup. You think? Fidel would
plummet if he weren’t in Hell al-
ready.

Charlotte: The devastating
effects of the coup having passed,
for the most part, the Queen City

cerned.

Davidson College: The little
Black Boxes are cute but just a
teeny bit fascist. You think? The
College holds steady, however, for
letting in some cute freshmen babes
(womyn, gender neutral “‘y’’).

Terry Holland: Clinch Val-
ley? ‘Nuff said. He plummets.
Atlanta: The

plunge this week but, in
fact, he is on a slight
upswing mostly because
it was announced that
his old preserved corpse
would be removed from
Moscow. Moscow offi-
cials were quoted as
saying “He justcast such
a gloomy pall over eve-
rything. We’rere-doing
the whole place in teal,
just like the Hornets!” It
turns out thatall this ime
he just wanted to be
buried next to his
mother. Just ;another

Olympics and_ the
Braves? A serious up-
swing from the days of
Carter and Billy Beer.
Dean Terry:
We can’t blame him for
wanting to entertain all
the new freshmen him-
self (and keep them away
from the sinful upper-
classmen). The only
problem here is: he’s not
that entertaining! Defi-
nite downswing.
Gorbachev:
Bad suits. Bad friends.
Bad BS rating. He sure

Mama’s boy gone bad.

Coup Plotters: Can you say
firing squad? These guys dropped
about six feet deep in BS.

Baltic States: Recognized by
almost every country in the world
except Cuba and the lost city of
Atlantis, the Estonians, Lithuani-
ans, and Latvians are on their way
up. Maybe now they’ll get cable.

Fidel Castro: That wardrobe

can once again set its sights on be-
coming amajor-league town. Keep
at itCharlotte, you’re almost there!
(Not.)

Davidson: That gun turret on
top of the town hall may help out in
the event ofan attack by our Native
American friends, but it’s damn
ugly. The town loses some charm
and drops as far as BS is con-

knows how to pick ‘em.

Raisa: Get well soon. Who
else could live with the big lug.
Good BS potential.

Boris Yeltsin: Good BS, but
needs tocontact Lasorda about that
gut.

Crown Heights: Just not a
good place to take the kids any-
more. Try Kennebunkport. It’s

gota lot of BS but it’s not Kosher.

AlSharpton: Geta life anda
haircut. Full of the other kind of
BS, so there’s no room for ours.

Jeff Dahmer: We're giving
him the cold shoulder this week.
No rating.

Pee Wee: Give him a break.
Some moviescan be really boring.
Medium BS.

Bush: Listen to him ramble
sometimes; this guy wentto Yale?
The prepared speeches are fine (but
they’re written by a Davidson
grad). Bush should stick to ‘em.
Otherwise, New World order going
fine; good BS. Deficit, what defi-
cit? We don’t need no stinkin’
deficit (if you’re going to borrow,
at least be obvious). >

Sununu: We hear there’s a
good opening down at the unem-
ployment line; check into it.
Almost out of BS.

John Tower:. God said he’s
one hell of a party animal.) Must
have been a Pika. No BS, he’s ,
dead!

God: Good.

Us: Always full of BS (that’s
a good thing).

You: What doesn’t kill you
makes you stronger. Remember
that during your shortened exam
period this year. Sorry, you’re
always less sagacious ‘than us,
we’re the columnists.

Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes?!

Like a lot of people, I have a
tendency to resistchange. Since at
least the third grade, I have worn
the same sorts of clothes, have had
the same basic haircut, and have
listened to.the same types of mu-
sic. Now, Ido not mean to suggest
that I sit around all day in red cour-
doroy overalls listening toold Cap-
tain & Tennille albums, I promise,
but changing is not somedung Ial-
ways do well.

Always.

At Davidson, most of resist »

1400 octogenarians might. We
don’t really like Patterson Court’s
new look, because we all know it’s

I’ve heard a lot of people say this
week that the new rushing edict is
for the birds, because, after all, the
language is ambiguous, and “‘en-
tertain” can mean so many, many

In a lot of
ways, we are all
resistant tochange,

on the surface,

tial. One aspect of
changing requires }.

for us, we know we must move on,
only that’s notalwayssuch an easy
thing to do, no matter how i insigni-

Giving up something that is valu-
able only because it seems like a

changes are made for us, well, the
