sae?”
Corner...

By Newt Spencer
“Why should we call ourselves men,

unless it be to succeed in everything,
everywhere? Say of nothing, ‘This is
beneath me,’ nor feel that anything

.| is beyond’ our powers, Nothing is im-
-| possible to.the man who can will.”

These are the wise words of Mirabeau.

At Davidson we have failed to suc-
ceed in one thing: clean speech! If this
was an Army Camp it would be a dif-
ferent situation—but this is Davidson,

. | and we have no place on our “honor-

roll” for disgusting “cussing” and
swearing. It cheapens you—and dis-
appoints those who respect you—to go
around swearing at everything, and
everywhere. You can cheapen your-
selves without coming to Davidson.
Raise yourselves while you have the
chance, “Silence is golden’. “Speak
not unless you have something worth-
while to say.” Do your part in making
Davidson—DAVIDSON—and put a
stop to your foolish—filthy talk.

Mr. E, A. Cutler in his book‘ Stu-
dent Standards of Action” says: “Real
regard for others, just as true self-
respect, involves restraint on one’s own
part from mean, disreputable or un-
worthy speech or conduct. The chival-
rous student finds no place in con-
versation for shady stories, no satis-
faction in sentimental spooning, no
delight in gossip, or anything which
cheapens himself or others. More than
this, such a student, for the sake of a
moment’s pleasure, will never wreck

his own life or the life of another
person, nor deaden the possibilities of
that joy of life found only in those
who are pure and true.”

“A Time For Greainess”—The mag-
netic challenge of our time was dyna-
mically,.and superbly presented to us
by the Members of the Christian Cam-
pus Mission Team which visited with
us November 6, 7, and 8. Dr. B. Frank
Hall of St. Louis, Missouri—empha-
sized the fact— that our only hope in
the new era of the Atomic Age is
Christianity, We must practice Chris-

tian ethics—and-make~the, Christian

principles of life vital in°our own
lives and actions,

.

Dr. Dwight Chalmers of Durham,

North Carolina—presented “The Lab-
oratory method in. Religion.” He
sincerely invited us to “try” Christ-
janity out for ourselves. Perform an
experiment of our own in Christian
action.
’ Finally, ‘Dr. J. J. Murray of Lex-
ington, Virginia—asked one import-
ant question: “Can God Trust Us?”
A's Christians we have many privil-
eges. But, as Christian—we have re-
sponsibilities that must not be neg-
lected.

Davidson stepped into the leading
light of the Westminster Fellowship
Retreat that was on campus Noy. 2-4.
Lamar Williamson of the class of 1946
of Davidson was elected President of
the Westminster Fellowship Organi-
zation of the Synod of North Carolina.
Lamar ° Williamson departed from

| Dayidsoh last. year to join the Army

Air Carps—and fias recently been dis-
charged from active service. He will
return-to campus’ in February to take
up where heé,Jeft off.

I would like to take this opportunity
to thank everybody on campus for co-
operating with the “Y”-Cabinet in en-
ertaining the Retreaters. There's noth-
ing like Westminster Fellowship.

In closing let me leave you with a
good thought: “Be ashamed to die—
unless you have attained some great

victory for humanity.”
