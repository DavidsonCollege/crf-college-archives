Davidson Admissions
Find Qualified Students

By BOB BRADFORD
Davidsonian Feature Writer

The problem of determining whom to accept into Davidson College has become

a major concern to all in administrative capacities of the college. This problem was pe submitted, but they must not/ and Tuesday, April 20-21,}:

plications.

I hesitate to use the word
“sought,” as there is always a
search for applicants who are
very well qualified. However,
even as late as 1953 only 64
applications for admission were
rejected. In 1958 Davidson re-
jected 307 applications for ad-
mission, and all trends seem to
indicate an even greater num-
ber of applications in the fu-
ture,

This problem is by no means
limited to Davidson. Every good
school throughout the country
has experienced the same up-
turn in number of applications.
Davidson has déveloped a very
detailed system for evaiuating
each perspective student. This
system witnesses alterations
every year and is relatively ac-
curate in estimating a boy’s
ability to do Davidson work.

The admissions committee,
composed of Mr. Hengeveld,

Dean Bailey, Mr. White, and

Professors Labban, Reid, Ost-
waid, and Workman, base

their selection of incoming
freshmen on both tangible

end intangible qualifications.

The tangible qualifications
involve a student’s high school
record, the recommendations
he receives from his principal
and teachers, and the results of
his college boards. Last sum-
mer Mr. White and Dr. Ostwald
devised an intricate system for
evaluating what a boy would do
scholastically at Davidson based
on his high school record and
college board scores..

This predicted average is by
no means infallible as shown

. by the first semester grades of
the present freshman class, but
there is a striking correlation
between the predicted averages
and the actual averages. The
two are particularly accurate in
predicting the averages at the
middle of the grade scale.

This raw score is by no
mesns interpreted literally,
as the score of two equally
qualified boys will vary from
high school to high school

mendations of the perspective

freshmen.

Ali recommendations are
kept strictly confidential, and
the teachers and principals are
very reliable in giving an ac-
curate account of a student's
qualifications. The admissions
office keeps records on the
reliability of various schools
concerning recommendations.
The rank of a student in his
class is véry indicative of what
he will do at Davidson.

Generally, more gravity is
placed on the high school rec-
ords and recommendations than
the college boards, as the col-
lege boards can vary as much
as fifty to one hundred points
when taken more than once,
and the college boards in no
way’ indicate a student's initia-
tive and desire to learn. They
only indicate raw ability, which
is by no means the only re-
quirement for success both in
college and the business world.

The intangible qualifica-
tions also weigh heavily in
considering a boy. These in-
clude whether or not he is
well-rounded, is emotionally
stable, shows characteristics
of leadership, and is qualified
in other ways to carry a Da-
vidson course of study. Also

extra consideration is given

to sons of alumni and boys
contemplating the ministry
as their life work.

All boys considered for ad-
missior under the athletic pro-
gram of the college must con-
form to the same academic re-
quirements as the other appli-
cants, The admissions commit-
tee does attempt in the process
of selection to consider these
boys as early as possible.

In 1958 there were approxi-
mately 950 applications for ad-
mission to Davidson, and this

will show an increase for 1959.
Of the 950 applications approxi-
mately 150 were incomplete,

meaning 800 completed applica- |

tions were considered. Of these
300 were rejected, and 500 were
accepted. Approximately one
half of these five hundred with-
drew their applications after
having been accepted, and the
other half entered the fresh-
man class.

Because of students’ applying
to more than one institution. it
fs necessary among all of the
first rate colleges of the coun-
try to accept approximately
twice as many students as there
are places. This appears to be
a very dangerous process, but.
it can not be helped, and it is
amazing how closely the num-'
ber of actual withdrawals cor-
responds to the number of pre-
dicted withdrawals.

A certain number of appli-

cations which obviously in-
volve students who should do
Davidson work satisfactorily
are accepted by Mr. Henge-
veld around the middle of
January. Others, which need
further consideration by both
Mr. Hengeveld and the ad-
missions committee, are with-
held, @ final decision made
known the latter part of
March.

As one can readily see, pro-
cessing the applications for ad-
mission is no easy task and be-
comes more involved each year.
1958 was the first year any ef-
fort was made to mathematical-
ly calculate a cold correlation
of college boards and high
school record against the actual
accomplishments of students
here in the past, and, even
though this s¥stem is by no
means flawless, it is a definite
aid in determining what a stu-
dent will produce at Davidson.

Westminster Talks
"Ethics And War"

The Davidson College West-
minster Fellowship elected of-
ficers and plannea for a joint
meeting with the Queens Fel-
lowship at its recent meeting
on April 8. Dave Mullen was
elected President; Henry Shue,
Vice-President and Program
Chairman; and Bert Keller, Sec-
retary:Treasurer.

The group will discuss the
topic “Christian Ethies and
Atomic War’ at its meeting
with the Queens Westminster
Fellowship on Saturday, April
18. The discussion will be held
at Myers Park Presbyterian
Church and the Davidson group
will leave from behind the Col-
lege Church at four o'clock.

A panel of three Davidson
and two Queens students will
be moderated by Lt. Col. Wil-
liam L. Adams, PMS&T of Da-
vidson College ROTC Depart-
ment. A meal prepared by the
Queens girls and a period of
fellowship will preceed the dis-
cussion.

The importance attached to
the Cabinet previously will be
replaced by the spiritual core
of the Voluntary Chapels. The
Cabinet’s duty will now be to
meet monthly to co-ordinate
YMCA activities and to make
decisions on policy. The total
work will be done on a more
personal and voluntary basis
than before.

The Cabinet will be com-
posed of the four executive
officers, the Area Chairmen,
representatives from denomi-

The Membership Drive will
be conducted by Wesley Weeks
and a committee of five
throughout the year in an ef-
fort to relate the interests of
individuals to the total pre-
gram. The emphasis of the cam-
paign will be to place members
in areas of work in which they
are interested rather than on-
ly to solicit funds.

YMCA programs planned for
the coming year include a panel
discussion by Davidson’s inter-
national students, a speaker
from the United Nations on an
issue of political importance, a
clothing drive among the stu-
dent body, and a retreat on the
weekend of May 9 for both the
old and new cabinets.
