Moderate Majority. Must End Violence

Campus Unrest Disgusts

ED. NOTE: The following
text was sent in the form of
an open letter by U.S. Sen-
ator Charles H. ‘Percy to all
college and university stu-
dents, faculty, and admin-
isstrators in Illinois. It was
printed in the Congressional
Record on September 14,
1970.

As a new academic year
opens, I want to share with
you some of my thoughts on
why I believe the next few
months will be crucial ones
in determining the future
course of higher education
in our country. ‘

1 do not have to tell you
that many campuses are in
ferment. That would belabor
the obvious. Nor would |
presume to prescribe speci-
fic remedies for the situation
on your own campus.

I realize, that different sit-
uations require different re-
sponses, and despite my
service on the Senate com-
mittee investigating campus
disorders, I do not presume
to be imbued with any speci-
al insight that has eluded’
educational experts from
New York to California.

‘Moreover, I am confident
that the overwhelming ma-
jority of the approximately
80 college and _ university
campuses in TIllinois § will
adapt themselves ‘to a
changing society within the
fexible framework of the
Constitution.

Only a comparatively
small number is likely to at-
tract the headlines through
their excesses, but this po-
tentially explosive minority
has become a major source
of concern throughout the
state and the nation.

As a United States Senator
from your state, I believe
I have a good grasp of the
sentiment of the public at
large in Illinois and of the
federal government toward
campus unrest.

Without debating the mer-
its of ‘the prevailing atti-
tudes, let me concisely and
candidly summarize them.
In my view, both the gen-
eral public and public offi-
cials are, in words ! have
heard a _ thousand times,
“fed-up.”” Their patience is
exhausted.

The majority wants order
restored to’ our campuses,
by whatever means, and it
is no longer interested in
what it considers to be eso-
terft debates over’ ‘‘respon-
‘siveness,’’ or ‘‘relevance’’ or

*‘social consciousness.'’ Per-
haps you sensed this during
the summer recess,
may be telling you some-
thing you already know.

I am presergting the situa-
tion to you very bluntly,
however, because, as I as-
sess it, the non-violent ele-
ments on college and uni-
versity campuses have two
choices open to them.

They can permit relative-
ly few radicals, bent on
challenging the overall tem-
per of the country, to con-
trol their destinies. By their
mute approval, they will in
many instances be responsi-
ble for the transforming
of campuses into armed
Camps.

Or, they can decide, as

‘ the Jargest component in the

academic community, that
their institutions will remain

‘ open. They can choose to

shape their own futures,
rather than having them de-
termined by external forces.

It is an indisputable fact
that no free society can
ever deploy sufficient num-
bers of policemen or guards-
men to put down an irre-
sponsible citizenry without
resorting to repressive mea-
sures and sacrificing individ-
ual liberty and freedom.

The majority of our citi-
zens must be committed to
the preservation of order or

there will be chaos. That is,

as true of the campus socie-
ty as it is of society at
large.

Quite properly, I believe,
institutions of higher learn-
ing resent outside involve-
ment in their affairs. They
believe that self-government
can work if allowed to flou-
rish in an atmosphere of to-
lerance and reason.

But on many campuses to-
day, intolerance and irra-
tionality have grown to
alarming proportions. Hisses
and obscene chants bury
the words of a speaker re-
presenting a different point
of view. Meaningless slogans
camouflage an absence of
independent thought.

Non - negotibale demands
destroy. any effort at nego-
tiation. Civility is a lost
art. Acts of terrorism-bomb-
ings, snippings, burnings—

are regraded as acceptable

expressions of free speech.
Perhaps most  disillusion-
ing of all, few voices within

the academic population are

raised in protest. Most of
those who do not condone

such behavior—a majority,
I would surmise albeit a
shrinking one—acquiesce in
it. Rarely does one hear a
distinction made between
laudable ends ‘and deplor-
able—or criminal—means.

Some moderates
despairingly of their inabili-
ty to influence the direction
of American institutions, and
especially government, by
working ‘‘within the | sys-
tem." I take strong excep-
tion to this attitude.

As evidence that such de-
featism is unwarranted, |

‘ would point to voter registra-

tion In the South, the im-
pact of the McCarthy cam-
paign in New Hampshire,
the present policy of @ stea-
dy withdrawal of American
troops from Southeast Asia,
the new willingness in the
Congress to thoroughly stru-
tinize military expenditures
and an Increasing “national
commitment’ to preservation
of our environment. |

The academic community
has played a major role in
bringing about each of. these
historic developments, and
similar examples
could be found.

Yet, let me concede, for
the sake of argument, that
campus
quickly and drastically alter
the course of a complex so-
ciety consisting of more
than 200 million people.

The fact remains that the
nonviolent elements can—
and must—be instruments
of orderly, appropriate
change in their campus; so-
cieties. To argue t hat a
numerical majority must sit
idly by and watch its insti-
tutions disappear in. flames,
clubs, and bullets, is. wholly
illogical.

If radicals—on the left or
the right, Weathermen or
Minutemen—gain control of
life on a campus, responsi-
bility for such a takeover is
not theirs alone. It ‘must be
shared by those members of
the academic community
who retreat in silence, and
thereby give their tact au-
thorization to the most de-
structive element in their
society.

Both the extreme left and
right employ violence for a
single purpose—to encourage
repressive measures by go-
vernment. The radical right
wants repression as an end

‘in itself because of its dis-

trust of the democratic pro-
cess, civil liberties and

speak _

established 1a w
ment processes.
The radical left wants’ re-
pression. as a means of en-
couraging a_ revolution of
class warfare that will des-

enforce-

‘tory society as we know it.

To stand up. against those
who would substitute force
for reason on our campuses
will mean inconvenience and
may require courage. But
moderates must join _ to-
gether to stem the tide of

_ campus violence by firmly

stating that’

they will not
permit it. :

If they abdicate their re-

sponsibility, ir all likelihood
they will invite swift and
unwelcome. intrusion into
their affairs by the heavy
hand of government.

Make no mistake about it,
given the choice between an-
archy and repression, gov-
ernment. will always choose
repression. And even a free
people will support such
measures, abhorrent as
they might be.

(My plea, then, is not for
less involvement in matters
of public policy. We in go
vernment .desperately need
the contributions of young
people and academicians.

Nor do I urge anyone to
refrain from expressing
himself on the obligations
and the functioning of his

Public

institution. College and uni-
versities., are. not exempt
from the flaws Wat scar the
other segments of our socic-
ty, ;

But I am earnestly. sug-
gesting that all members of
the academic community in
Tlinois dedicate themselves
to insuring peace on their
campuses in this academic
year.

With a strong commit-
ment to non-violence, you
can rescue your institutions
from an obstreperous min-
ority who would sacrifice
your right to teach and to
learn to further their own
ultimate interests—interests
that you do not share no
matter how they are dis-
guised. ~

The future of this nation
is inextricably tinked to the
future of its colleges and
universities. With the stakes
so high, Americans will not
and cannot permit these in-
stitutions to cease their
Operations. 3

The key question is wheth-
er the campuses will func
tion as centers: of free _in-
quiry, governed by the will
of the majority, ‘or as
strongholds of -anarchy,
marked by riot and repres-
sion, In darge measure, the
moderate majority holds
the answer—and it must be
decisive.

Up Pariscope

ED. NOTE: Emerson Bell
foured France during his
senior term last spring.
Herein some of his impres-
sions of Paris.

We live near the Eiffel
Tower and every now and
then, when I think this is
all a dream, I ‘walk over

to take a look. The Eiffel
Tower is. real - sometimes
very ugly and sometimes

very beautiful.

It's an appropriate symbol
for Paris, the City of Light.
At times, Paris is dirty and
ugly - with people shoving
in the subway, cars bluffing
one another for right-of-way.

At, times Paris is just a
big city where no one has
time to care about anything
but himself. But the coin

has another side.

(My French landlady has
ironed my_shirts when I was
in a big hurry to catch a
train. One Parisian family I
met while

hitchhiking _ in-

vited me into their small
apartment for a drink. An-
other family has had me
over for supper more than
once,

I could go on - these are
only a few of my memories
of my French friends. An
odd mixture of efficiency-
inefficiency, aloofness and
warmth, these people have
made a deep impression on
me.

I shall be forever grate-
ful to those at Davidson who
encouraged and helped me

} plan this quarter in Paris.

‘My experiences here cannot
be translated into quality
points.

Complemented by my
Paris experiences, my Da-
vidson education has _be-
come a rounded unity. I
can’t express it any better
than that. I don't yet fully
understand all that I've
learned - at Davidsoh or in
Paris...
