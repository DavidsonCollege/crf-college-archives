The Stone Wall

It may be a waste of editorial space and energy
to continue to knock our heads against the stone wall
of closed faculty meetings. For we are convinced that
any proposals to open these meetings to students are
inevitably doomed to failure.

Some comments are necessary, however, if just
to keep the professorial ranks honest in their deliber-
ations and communications with the students.

Faculty members have complained for years
about the irresponsibility of the Davidson — student.
Many professors are convinced that students here
are, on the whole, indolent, apathetic, unmotivated
and immature. And their insights are not very far
from the truth.

What these members of the faculty have fail-
/ed to realize, however, is that the irresponsible na-
ture of the students here is built upon the fact that
they have never been allowed. to act responsi-
bly while at Davidson. The students have their token
government, their token leaders and their token re-
presentation, but when it comes down to the nitty-
gritty of making the basic decisions affecting their
life and lifestyle at Davidson, they have absolutely
no authority. ond

Therefore, it seems to us that students should
be allowed to attend faculty meetings. Opening fac-
ulty meetings would offer this campus the -oppor-
tunity for educational relationships that it has never
before seen. It would offer both the students and the
professors for the first time a chance to honestly ex-
change ideas outside of the sterile confines of the

classroom and the academic situation. It could servé

to show students that professors are human, and
it might demonstrate ‘to the faculty that students,
when given a position requiring responsible action,
can respond quite intelligently and maturely.

Even though we do realize that the faculty will
destroy any proposals to open its meetings, we can
still hope for a miracle. For perhaps some day the
Davidson professors will realize that honest communi-
cation isn’t really painful, that change isn’t really
that difficult, and that students aren’t really second-
rate citizens.

Words Arid Deeds

Community talk is fine, it sounds good to hear

it from students and administrators. It’s just unfortun-
ate that performance does not follow from the words.

Again the college has deciced that in times of

financial stress that cuts will be made in an area

* which concerns primarily students and the business
office, the position of clinical psychologist.

The failure to renew Dr. Hall’s contract is diffi-
cult to accept. We have confidence that Dr. Werk-
man is competent to handle the position but question
whether or not he can be as effective as a man from
outside the continuing community. He is still connect-
ed with the regular college, students will still have
him for course work, he will still be listed in the
catalog.

The clinical psychologist is here for the bene-
fit of the students. Davidson can be a trying and
exasperating place. It would only seem reasonable
for the students to have a role in the decision on the
clinical psychologist.

Unfortunately this was not the case. The students
have shown a desire to have a psychologist from out-
side the continuing community, a man with whom
they have only their personal contact. The senate
clearly voiced this sentiment at Monday’s meeting.

Yet the students were not in on the decision and
their ideas seem to have been pushed by no one in
the case.

Davidson students need a clinical psychologist.
In asking. Dr. Workman to accept the position the
administration has declined to ask student advice
and has put Dr. Workman at a disadvantage’ before
he begins his work.

Stanton Kaye: ‘A Biggie’

Stanton Kaye reminded
me of the-movie ‘‘Exodus”

‘the first time I saw him.

Or maybe he reminded me
of Sal Mineo in ‘‘Exodus.”
If Sal Mineo had a fat kid
brother with bushy hair who
couldn’t hack the kibbutz
scene and decided to go
back to Brooklyn and open
a deli, it would be Stan-
ton Kaye.

Stanton Kaye does not run
a deli, he’s a filmmaker. I
met him at the USA Film
Festival last month in Dal-
las. It was between screen-
ings; and we were in the
lobby of the Bob Hope
Theatre at SMU. He was
wearing his khaki shirt and
smoking ‘a cigarette, and
just came up and _ started
talking to me and some kids
from SMU who were man-
ning the ticket table.

The conversation was a
series of non sequiturs about
the weather, places to go
in Dallas, going to Six Flags

over Texas—everything but .

fidmmaking. I thought he
was some freak grad _ stu-
dent attending the festival.
After he went outside with
some guys to throw a fris-
bee, Kit Carson, co-director
of the festival, came up to
me and said, ‘‘Oh, I see you
were talking with Stanton.
He's quite a guy, eh?” For
all I knew, Stanton could
have been a potted plant.

So I gave Kit a what-are

LETTER

Trio Cry
For Foresight

To the Editor:

We have found it.

Davidson College  enter-
tainment is no longer a
mystery. It is all very clear
now. Yesterday, while stroll-
ing through the College. Un-
ion, I came upon an open
briefcase. Being a curious
soul, I bent down to examine

it, when lo and behold, a -

folder fell out, of it.

It plopped open before my
eyes and there, in black,
brown, and white was a con-
tract. Breathing rapidly over
my find, I summoned two
friends who were nearby. We
were astonished..by what we
discovered.

The contract was with
an, entertainment booking a-
gency, Whoarsesheeitt Pro-
ductions. Emblazoned in
brown at the top of the docu-
ment was a motto: ‘‘A Pile
of, Entertainment for your
money.”

“It appeared that this was
an exclusive contract, limit-
ing all our concerts and
other entertainment to that
which would be supplied by
Whoarsesheeitt. At the bot-
tom of the document, I found
the signatures of several
high union officials and J.
Edgar Whoarsesheeitt,  di-

. rector,

Our curiosity was only
heightened by this find, so
we eagerly looked into the
Another contract
was found, this one for

you-talking-about look, and
he proceeded to explain that
Sal Mineo’s brother was in
reality a filmmaker — not
only a filmmaker, but the
filmmaker whose | film
“Brandy in The Wilderness”
had been chosen as Critics’
Choice for the festival. That
ain’t half bad when the cri-
tics are guys like Jonas
Mekas, P. Sitney Adams,
Andrew Sarris, Dwight Mac-
Donald, and Paul Schrader.

After I saw ‘‘Brandy”’ that
afternoon, I could see why
it was Critics’ Choice. The
film is about a young film-
maker (Stanton) who makes
a film of, and gets involved
with a girl (Brandy). Simple
enough.

Stanton called it his ‘‘glori-
fied home movie.” That’s like

Burney

To the Editor:

I want ‘to express my
deepest sympathy to Cecil
Burney on the occasion of
his deep loss. It is evident
from his harangues on the
college and especially on the
chureh recently that he has
suffered a great loss. :

Apparently ne has nothing
really positive in his life.
Apparently hee has nothing
that he really prizes at Da-
vidson—perhaps he’s’ even
jealous of the fact that others
might have—or do have.

H uzzah

a particular booking by
Whoarsesheeitt. The date on
it was for®the next concert
weekend at Davidson.

The name of the group
was ‘The Goose Creek
Dreaming Illustrated Poco-
Byrd Jazz, Steam and Bana-
na Barimba Band.” Shivers
of anticipation ran through
our bodies at the prospect
of having ‘‘The Goose Creek
Dreaming Illustrated . Poco-
Byrd Jazz, Steam and Bana-
na Barimba Band’ in con-
cert.

But perhaps the greatest
find of the afternoon was a
list of the groups from
Whoarseheeitt. We studied it
and discovered that- JUDY
COLLINS WAS NOT ON IT!

Employing our lightning
fast, analytical minds, we
instantly realized why she
did not appear, why we were
saved from such garbage.
Whoarsesheeitt stopped her.
The exclusive contract would
prevent her from appearing
here. Yes, it is now very
clear.

We iooked back at the ini-
tial contract and breathed a
sigh of relief, for it was in
no danger of lapsing. The
expiration date on it was
1985. Huzzah for the far-
sighted social council! Huz-
zah for Whoarsesheeitt!

Faulkner saying he was “just
a country boy telling stories.”

But what this home movie
is really ‘‘about” is the na-
ture of the film experience,
the camera used to record
pyschological and emotional
history, the conflict between
the illusion we. see on the
screen. and the reality we at-

‘tach to that illusion. It is

expression of Stanton Kaye’s
whole theory of film aesthe-
tics. arte

With half a chance, Stan-
cton Kaye is going to be a
biggie. He’s one of a half-
dézen .American ‘filmmakers
who ten years: from now

_ critics are going to call the

molders of the NEW AMER-
CAN CINEMA. And te think
J knew him when he was
Sal Mineo’s brother.

Blasted

.To assume that anyone
over 30 (make that 21 or 22)
has no capacity for compas-
sion, tolerance, the aware-
ness of human need, liberal
thinking, etc, is to pronounce
him (Burney) not only ignor-
ant (perhaps not by board
scores’ but my better ways
of judging) but’ himself in-
tolerant and gauche.

How: many people does he
know in the ‘‘Real World’’?
How much -has’ he done for
the poor? Where is he look-
ing for the ‘Truth’? What
does communal living add
to the betterment of society?

And so to him—our deep-
est sympathy and_ sincere
condolences in his bereave-
ment. :

ED. NOTE: This letter was
sent to College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.; how-
ever THE DAVIDSONIAN
was asked to print it in this
issue.

To the Editor: a

I am presently .a_ sopho-
more here at Davidson. The
matter to which I call your
attention is the absence of
blacks from Davidson's fac-
ulty and the upper echelons
of its administration.

This is a situation which
IT feel should be rectified as
rapidly as specifics will al-
low. It is hypocritical on Da-
vidson’s part to support the
recruitment of black stu-
dents into such a lily-white
situation. The absence of
black professionals must be
interpreted by prospective
black enrollees as a lack
of commitment to the crea-
tion of a campus environ-
ment which reflects the rac-
ial dignity of all.

Primarily, I would like to
know what your thoughts
are on the situation and what
attempts at rectification have
been made in the past. In
addition, I have sent copies
of -this letter to the Dean
of the Faculty and depart-
ment chairmen, in the hope
that the discussion on this
point may be intensified on
an. effectual, campuswide
basis.

A response at your earliest
convenience will be great-
ly appreciated.
