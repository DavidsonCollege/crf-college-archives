CAT-TALES

By TONI CASALI |

WEDNESDAY, NOV. 16, 1938

‘Paul Shu certainly lived up to advance dope last Saturday against
Davidson's “‘never-say-quits” Wildcats. He is probably the most out-
standing back to perform on Richardson Field this season and if he has
played in all the other games on the V. M. I. schedule as he did against
our ‘Cats, he undoubtedly will run off with All-Southern honors again
this year. Shu was the difference between the two teams—without him,
V. M. I. would have had a hard time beating Davidson. They would
have had a tough time scoring the three touchdowns—he scored all
three and the thing about it was that he set all three of them up. V. M.
I.’s first score came soon after the kick-off, following Davidson's lone
marker, Shu carried the ball seven straight times from the 45-yard
stripe. Three of these times he made better than ten yards

Then after he scored Davidson received the kick-off deep in
'Cat territory. Davis kicked to the 50-yard line, where the ball began
bounding and bounced to the V. M. I. 48, where Shu scooped it up
and skirted 62 yards to score. It was a beautiful run, excelling any-
thing that has been seen on the 'Cat field to date. Not satisfied
with these two quick scores, he took a pass from Trzeciak late in
the final quarter to end the scoring for the day. Now if that per-
formance isn’t worthy of some mention on all-star teams, there
never was one. Of course, while you were busily watching the shin-
ing Shu, Andy Trzeciak, the Cadet captain and fullback, was prob-
ably overlooked. He played a fine game—60 minutes in all—and
much credit is due him. V. M. I. presented the best all-around
backfield that the ’Cats have faced this year. All four of the start-
ing back were tripple-threats and could pass, punt, run and block
with the best of them.

Davidson has game left on the 1938 annual
Turkey Day clash with Wake Forest’s Demon Deacons. There prob-
ably isn’t an uppef clavaman around who has forgotten last year’s game
and Davidson out for revenge. Wake Forest, however, with its
flaming sophs led by Tony Gallovitch and Red Mayberry, is strongest
in years. They have risen to heights against Duke and Carolina. They
beat South Carolina, the team that tied: Villanova who beat Auburn,
25-12. Yes, it looks bad for the ’Cats.

Wake Forest, a few years back, held a jinx over the 'Cats. Re-
cently that. jinx has been broken and we don’t want to see it started
again. The thing about this game is that Davidson would rather
lick the Deacs than any other ten teams, including Duke and Caro-
lina. If Davidson licks them they can say that they have had a suc-
cessful season. Coach McEver will be giving his squad some tough
workouts in preparation for those Deacs and before the game is
over there will be plenty of football exhibited. The former Tennes-
see All-American will use every trick available against the Deacs
and if the 'Cats are right—watch out Wake Forest.

Well the 1938 season is almost at a close and already the question
of what kind of prospects Davidson will have for next year has come
up. Right now things look pretty good with plenty of material coming
up from the B team and more from the frosh eleven. This year frosh
eleven is undoubtedly the best in recent years. There are fine
running backs on hand. Spencer, Hackney, and Simonds can carry
the mail pretty fair for first year men and also do a good job kicking
and passing. Big Stan Yoder, with his 185 pounds, should give some-
body a merry race for one of the back positions. He can take punish-
ment and can block and “back up the lines as well.
Don Bell and Etmer Knoeller, both of whom tip the scales better than
the 190 pound mark, have shown excellent abilities at their tagkle posts.

With some experience behind these two rugged boys they will “go places.
Frank Caldwell is the heaviest center to play on a frosh team in many
a year and will come in handy as will George Marsh, who has been
playing a neat game at guard so far this season.

Varsity basketball practice is now in full swing and from all in-
dications Davidson will have a winning team this year. They will
give Southern Conference teams plenty of trouble before the season
finishes as the ’Cats have more returning lettermen than any other

The race for the other starting positions will be between Bill
Boyd, a smooth ball handler, Swede Johnston, Benny Harrison
and Jim Thomas, who all saw plenty of service last year. ;
It looks like there will be plenty of reserve strength on hand, too.
Several members of last year’s fine frosh quint are groomed to see

action, along with some of the reserves from last year’s varsity. Some
of the boys who are out are: Jim Hogg, Apie Means, George Ficklen,
Tommy Glenn, Bob Phipps, Winston Taylor, and Bobby Williams.

Maybe if a B.team could be made up of some of these boys so that
they might get some experience, they would come in handy in future
seasons.

Interfraternity football season is drawing to a close with several
teams still fighting it out for first place. honors. The Kappa Sigs
lead the pack with no defeats chalked up against them to date.
These games are among the most popular on the campus today and
the proverbial bunch of posies should be given to Pete Whittle for
the fine way in which he has conducted his intramural program.

P. S. I request someone—ANYBODY—to write this column

The Kappa Sigs came through

at the same time kept the Kappa
