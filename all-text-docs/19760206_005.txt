brewing disillusion

{Continued from page 4]

studying moving from social stigma
to academic vogue. People running
scared. Big brothers out of jobs.
Security. ‘‘Yes sir, I have always
wanted to be a doctor.”

He thought back on his freshman
year. What did he remember? Chem-
istry 31 and 41 were just about gone.
Acid and base? Even Humanities was
slipping. Gilgamesh, arete, and Plu-
tarch’s Lives. But remember that
herd date to Salem? Remember the
‘‘Great Streak’’? Remember the
South Carolina game? Whatever hap-
pened to Steve Morris? How about
Fireman or even Krishna? What did I
take Spring term?

An article in a magazine. At the
University of Denver, Michael Rock,
an economics professor, walked into
class one day near the end of the term
and announced that he would auction
off gradee in the class--for money.
The results?

“Although a few students pro-
tested, Mr. Rock took in almost
$2000, getting an average of $85 for
an A, $55 for a B, and $35 for aC. One
student, noticing that several others
were absent, bought up all the extra
C’s and D’s and tried to sell them for
inflated prices. Mr. Rock...took pro-
missory notes from most of the
students, but one gave him $80 in
cash. A few students said they
destroyed term papers and stopped

studying for final exams after the
auction.”

“College, he had said, ‘‘is essent-
ially four years in which to grow up.”

His major had changed as many
times as his sheets. His ideas of
himself had varied even more. He had
felt a need for limited fame. He had
felt a need for immediate service. He

had often seen himself through a

career. He had often pictured himself
by means of his friends. Occasion-
ally, he felt the thrill of unforseen
discoveries. Occasionally, he had felt
the dross of unmitigated boredom.
More often, he had been entirely
unsure of what, or if, he felt.

He was now considered an upper-
classman. He didn’t feel it. He knew
time was slipping by. He refused to
believe it. He felt things were quieter.
He knew people were changing. He
even thought, at times, he was
included. But most of the time, he
truly wondered if he had grown at all.

He had a year to go.

[This is, admittedly, neither a
definitive statement or a clearcut
solution. It is also more an amalga-
mation than a personal testimony.
But this article is meant to raise
questions. Perhaps stir up contro-
versy. This is your paper. These
editorial pages are even more so. Why
not let yourselves be heard? [Specific

... belief and tenure

{Continued from page 4]

luke-warm in their religion and the
process of erosion followed.

Apathy toward religion rather than
challenge and debate ensued and only
much later did the hypocrisy become
apparent. Exposing the anomaly 6f
having professed believers with only
nominal commitments brought the
abolition of religious requirements for
tenure.

I believe that religious questions
are of supreme importance to modern
man, and I yearn for vigorous debate
of them by faculty and students. And
this can only occur in a free atmo-
sphere where challenges to religion
are voiced by opponents. The church-
related college can legitimately build
the institutional structure where
these questions are seriously consi-
dered.

Doctrinal requirements in oaths,
creeds, and professions are the pro-
vince of a church not a college. The
church-related college is not a church;
it exists as a college dedicated to the
education of youth and the pursuit of
truth.

Religious restrictions upon tenure
can also become a weapon in the
hands of administrators to eliminate
teachers whom they dislike from the
permanent ranks of their institutions.

If some of those who receive tenure
in a college with such restrictions do
not fulfill the religious requirements
and others with the same beliefs are
dismissed, then at least in some cases
of nonrenewal, religion may be a veil
for the reasons behind dismissal.

During the last two decades, many
colleges, both Protestant and Cath-

olic, have eliminated all such restric-

tions upon tenure without giving up
their claims to be institutions of
higher learning affiliated with eccles-
iastical bodies.

Many Presbyterian colleices place
no religious conditions upon tenure.

Perhaps they believe that any doct-
rinal qualification upon tenure vio-
lates the nature of academic freedom.
Or perhaps they have come to realize
that theological assertions rest upon
their own-merits and need no institu-

tional defense in an arena of free

inquiry.

Those who claim to have found the
religious Truth do not fear that their
position will be undermined by chal-
lenges from opponents. They believe
that their doctrines can stand the test
of time through continuous scrutiny.
And those who hold more tenuous
beliefs are equally willing to examine
alternative positions in their quest for
religious understanding.

Davidson College can eliminate its
requirement that tenured faculty
members be active members of Chris-
tian churches without jeopardizing its
position as a church-related college.

By doing so, we will affirm that
tenure protects academic freedom and
not primarily a denominational set of
religious standards. If we wish to
pursue the truth, let us do so ina

spirit of open inquiry. Religious.

questions ought to be debated upon
this and every other campus and,
related to the Presbyterian Church,
this college can take institutional
steps to insure discussion of these
issues.

Davidson has moved i in this direc-
tion by allowing some tenured faculty
members to be exceptions to the
religious standard as ‘‘reverent seek-
ers of the truth” instead of qualifying
as active members of churches. Let us
complete the step with a full affirma-
tion of academic freedom through un-
restricted tenure.

Let us also affirm the ecclesiastical
relation of the college through vigor-
ous debate of religious questions, a
strong chapel program, a strong
counseling program emphasizing the
worth of the individual, and through

humane teaching and administration.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

S

To the Editor:

Last week I received a letter from a
friend who transferred from Davidson
after Fall Term this year, it being his
sophomore year. Most of the letter
was a contrast between Davidson and
McGill College to which he trans-
ferred. Although he did overplay
some of the facts I felt he made some
valid points. I’m not saying I totally
agree or disagree with what he said,
but a few of the statements struck
home. I hereby submit it for the
Davidson student body and faculty to
mull over.

Jarry Taylor ’78
Davidson College

Dear Jarry,

I started yesterday and have
finished today’s classes, so I’ve been
to all my classes except one. All I can
say is I know I’m going to love it. I
don’t know where to begin in the ways
it tops Davidson because in my eyes
there’s just so many. I’ll just try to
list them as they come to me, not
necessarily in order of importance.

First, the class sizes, Out of the
four I’ve been in, two are what you’d
have to call large (150) and the other
two are'around 50. I’ll tell you, Jarry,
that’s the way I like it and I’ll tell you
why. No more brown nosing! With
150 people in a class you know that no
Joe Blow is going to put up his hand.

]| to tell the professor what a wonderful

human being he is. But if you have a
serious question you can go ahead and
ask it.

I thought. because of the number of
people it would be embarrassing but
it’s not because you realize they’re
just students like yourself. But you
would be amazed how few questions
there are once you get rid of the b.s.
The class runs much more smoothly
than one at Davidson where everyone

the teacher.

Next, the campus. Jarry, you really
feel like you’re somewhere when you
are here. Instead of walking around
Chambers all day staring at the same
smiling faces and trying to remember
you’re not still in high school, at
McGill you know you’re in a univer-
sity; you’re constantly meeting new
and different people and that makes it
exciting.

You don’t stumble out of your loft
every morning, throw on the same
dirty clothes, stumble down to Ri-
chard’s for some powdered eggs
before dragging youself over to
Chambers to listen to some boring
professor try to describe medieval

just not like that here Jarry. I can’t:
explain why, it’s just something you

thing; anyone that ever said big
universities suck’’ never went to.

_trying to study humanity with a 1000

times the size of Davidson’s plus
separate libraries for most of the
departments. Also, there is the
“plus” of having professors that are
in. touch with the ‘‘Real World” rathei
than back-woods teachers who teach
out of 40 year-old books they used at
Chapel Hill; or brand new ones they
can’t begin to understand.

I’m not ‘saying the professors here
are more intelligent than the teachers
at D.C.; I’m saying you can’t live in
the hillbilly country of North Carolina
and comprehend the intricacies of
urban affairs or anything that re-
quires some personal involvement on
the student’s or teacher’s part, and of
course that includes all the social
sciences.

Sure if you take pre-med at McGill |:
University or Davidson there’s no
difference (except. the facilities here
are far superior) because a fetal pig is
a fetal pig no matter where it’s
dissected. But when you attempt to
delve into the human condition, you
can’t hope to get any understanding
of it when you’re separated from the
rest of humanity with 1200 solid
presbyterians and a hundred 67 86
ancient teachers, totally segregated
from reality and with little or no
desire to get back in touch with it.

McGill and D.C. are worlds apart
and the longer I’m away from
Davidson the more I realize this.
When I think back at last year and
the first part of this one, it astonishes
me that I stayed at D.C. as long as I
did. But, I’ll tell you one thing, I
thank the Lord (operating: under the
premise that there is one) that I got
out of there before it was too late.
Jarry, for me at least, it was a total
waste of time. Yet, I suppose I would }.
never recognize the advantages of this
place if I’d never been to Davidson.

People at D.C. are close-minded,
they come to Davidson thinking they |.
know everything, and go through four

years trying to prove it. There’ s no
hang

Right there you have the difference
between McGill and Davidson. At
McGill you've got people who came to
find out answers, studied, and
reached conclusions. At Davidson:
there was a bunch of kids whose faith
was based on.the Sunday School class
they attended when they were five or]
six, saw something was missing in
their lives and found it in Jesus at an
FCA meeting with Bart Star. And
there you have the difference.

When I was at Davidson I was

kids who already knew the answers.
It mattered little what Freud or Plato
said in the books they read, they
didn‘t want to learn, they wanted to
get good grades on the next exam.
And this had a detrimental effect on
me. I got bored and apathetic. Tha.
grades didn’t mean much to me and}

that was going on and neither did
‘course content.

Well fortunately that has all
changed; I’m where I should’ve been

the answers and I want to try to find

them out..Oh, I know I'll never

undérstand everything but at least}
I’m going to try. -

‘Love y’ all,
