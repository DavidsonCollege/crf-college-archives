Students relieve major blues at Center for Special Studies

By TOBY TRUOG

WANTED: Bright, motivated students
who do not find solace in the curriculum at
Davidson College. Come sell the group of
participating faculty on your own idea of a
major. The Center for Special Studies can
satisfy you because you design your own
program.

Since 1970 the Center for Special Stud-
ies has offered an exciting alternative to the
traditional liberal arts curricular major.
Eighteen years ago the Center was actually
a college within a college. It was consid-
ered the Honors College, a separate entity
from the college proper.

“The Center now exists as a unique aca-
demic structure, offering many interdisci-
plinary courses,” said Director John Brock-
way; and courses are not restricted to Cen-
ter majors. Terrorism in Peru, “the mid-

western mind,” rural Indian health care,
and the biology and conservation of sea
turtles at Sri Lanka are examples of the
most recent majors. Six seniors are cur-
rently pursuing self-designed studies, anda
number of junior applications are pending.

“A student can pull together a number of
courses to form a concentration of sorts,
thus not limiting his Center major to one
area of curriculum,” said Brockway.

The goal of the Center is to give
Davidson students a choice. “We are here
to support the student and his ability to
design his own major.” Brockway ener-
gizes undecided students, showing them
that the College has much more to offer
than is readily visible. The Center often
helps students to reach untapped potential
in fields that interest them most. The Dean
Rusk and Sloan Technical programs work

in conjunction with the Center to further
maximize opportunities.

In order to design a major, a student fills
out an application with an outline of pro-
posed studies. Before the Center accepts an
application, it verifies resources the stu-
dent used and has a faculty committee
review the student’s plan. To complete a

Center major, a student must write thesis.
“The senior thesis is the culmination of all
the student’s work,” said Brockway.

If motivation is in your back pocket and
an out-of-the-ordinary major of your own
genius is bouncing around in your head,
then the Center for Special Studies is-worth
checking into.

CATALOGUES, from page 6

Specialist Bill Ligas said that Spiegle has
been aware of the college market for quite
a while. “It’s a different kind of effort to
attract students. We want to attract them
when they’re beginning to make purchases,
because if we do a good job with service
and they get used to taking advantage of
mail order, they might be customers for

life.”

Whether they, order from them or not,
students enjoy finding favorite catalogues
in their p.o. boxes each month. Perusing the
latest fashions has become a popular way to
take a break from studying. “My whole life
seems to revolve around the campus,”
Bastian commented, “that’s why I was so
excited when I got my first catalogue the
other day. The prospect of getting new
clothes is always exciting.”
