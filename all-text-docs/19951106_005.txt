400 students

support

By Apa HIckEy

Frustrated by a lack of ad-
equate facilities and the disunity
this promotes, ISA and Dean Rusk
sought student support for the idea
of bringing international interests
under one roof.

The ISA is circulating a peti-
tion which roughly 400 students
have signed, and the number is
growing.

Students who sign the petition
are agreeing to the statement at the
top, which in part states, “I [the
signer] would make use of [an in-
ternational house].”

Yet Dennis Seavers, co-chair
of the International House Com-
mittee, a division of the Interna-
tional Students Association con-
cedes that not all the signers are
aware of the fact the house will be
formed for non-international
Davidson students as well.

“It will be a difficult job to
convince students it’s for all stu-
dents, not just internationals, but I
think it can be done,” he said.

Dr. Shelly Rigger, a faculty
advisor of the ISA, stated, “There
are too many populations involved
to justify [that misconception].”

Dennis Seavers, co-chairman
of the International House Com-
mittee, a division of the, Interna-
tional Students Association, stated
the group wants “a place where
there can be a. . . particularly
international social atmosphere.”

“Right now there’s no unity
for internationally concerned pro-
grams,” he says. “No real place
where students can hang out on
campus. The Union is program
oriented. . . . International pro-
grams are spread out, and that en-
courages separation.”

The ISA and the Student .Ad-
visory Council to the Dean Rusk
Program are collaborating on a
proposal which would devote one
of the college properties located
on Main Street to the two pro-
grams. The house would be for
social and program use, as well as
contain office space.

Ambassador Ken Brown, Di-
rector of the Dean Rusk program,

I House

initiated the efforts earlier this year
with a memo he sent to Dean of
Faculty Robert Williams. The ISA
joined forces with Dean Rusk
shortly thereafter.

Besides ISA and Dean Rusk,
she feels the house will benefit
students who plan on going abroad,
students who are taking a foreign
language and desire more expo-
sure, and all other internationally
concerned students.

A formal proposal has not yet
been submitted to the Facilities
and Planning Committee, the group
that would have final say on the
proposition.

Dr. John Kelton, Committee
Chairman, stated that while it has
not yet become official business,
“we are aware it’s coming.”

Though no official statement
on the idea can be made at this
point, said Kelton, “My sense is
that it will be considered with a
positive view about it.”

He stresses, however, that
other suggestions have been made
for the use of the house in question,
and they will be weighed as well.

Cost is a major factor. Giving
the house to an organization would
leave the College with one less
residence for faculty use and would
result in a loss of revenue.

Moving the house, which is
currently located on Main Street
near the Exxon station, would be
an expensive project, and so would
connecting the computer and phone
access needed for the offices in-
volved.

A date for submitting the final
proposal has not yet been set. In
addition to the petition, supporters
plan on gathering letters from fac-
ulty in support of the idea, along
with other indications of student
support.

Estimated cost and approval

' from Deans who supervise both

programs are other items Kelton
would like to see in any proposal
that reaches his Committee.

Despite the complexities in-
volved, Rigger summarized the
overriding goal, “We’d really like
students to have some place where
they’d be comfortable vegging out
for about half an hour.”

Administrative exchange
was learning experience

Sheryl McGinnis-enjoyed her
stay at Davidson last week. Dr.
David Staton enjoyed his trip to
Spelman College two weeks ago.
The two participated in a pilot ad-
ministrative exchange program
between the two schools.

Former Assistant Dean of Stu-
dents John Eaves “really set this
up,” says Dean of Students Tom
Shandley. According to Shandley,
Davidson approached Spelman, a
historically black, all-female col-
lege, because it was “looking to
establish a relationship with a his-
torically black college.”

While stressing that this ex-
change was only evaluative, “a pi-
lot’, to see how productive such a
program could be, Shandley says,
“We'd like to do it again.”

McGinnis is the Assistant Di-
rector of Career Planning and
Placement at Spelman and was on

Seniors Nick Troiano and Pete
Boylan will spend a weekend on
an all-expenses-paid trip to New
York City, where they will talk to
some of the top business execu-
tives in the world.

Troiano and Boylan will be
among 200 students from all over
the world will gather from No-
vember 19 through 21 to discuss

the changing business world.
Business Tomorrow Interna-

tional will host the students plus

100 major business executives.
The Foundation for Student

Communications, an organization _

originally started at Princeton, read
the applications and selected
Troiano and Boylan to attend.
Executives will speak talk
about subjects, including “Evolv-
ing Management Styles,” “Chang-
ing Corporate Culture,” and “Di-

Big Apple
versity and Innovation.” After the
speeches, the students and execu-
tives will divide into groups and
discuss these issues.

Of the opportunity Troiano
says, “I’mthinking about pursuing
a job in New York, and this is just
something I’m interested in.”

Associate Director of Career
Services Bill Felty adds, “This is
going to be great for their careers,
but also a great opportunity to get
their opinions into the mix.”

ous. differences”. between t

schools, she also spoke of the goals ?

common to both institutions.
“There is a commitment to aca-
demic excellence and a commit-
ment to developing the entire stu-
dent,” she said. “‘The total product
is a good one.”

McGinnis appreciated the dif-
ference of leaving a place in which
she was in the majority to one
where she was in the minority. “It
keeps us open to learning new
things,” she said.

Director of the Student Health
Center David Staton visited
Spelman from October 15 through
18. He was impressed with the
“real sense of history” and “real
sense of family” he found on cam-
pus.

He noted the good “team-
work” and “good connection” be-
tween student life and academic
life. Professors were really in-
volved in the extra-curricular lives
of their students, according to

Staton. “There was interaction

While she noted “some, obyi- or : Sanaa ; ;

ment is happening [at Davidson]
but I thought it was awfully good
there.”

Staton admired Spelman’s —
Convocation Credits which he
compares in some ways to
Davidson’s PE 101 program. Con-
vocation Credits are programs and
events which students are required
to attend in order to graduate.

According to. Staton, the pro-
grams offer information which will
prove important and valuable in
the long run, even though they cut
into equally important study-time.

Spelman students were also
very interested in Davidson’s
Honor Code and in creating simi-
lar code in their community, ac-
cording to Staton.

On a personal level Staton
appreciated the acceptance he
found at Spelman. “To go to a
place that is historically black and
to make connections was a very
gratifying thing,” he says.
