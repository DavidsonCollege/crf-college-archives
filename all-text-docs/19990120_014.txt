Tuesday, December 8th @ 7:30 PM
Belk Arena (Davidson, NC)
L 71- 62

This year’s annual battle for the
Hornets’. Nest Trophy gave the 4,243
fans that packed Belk Arena their
money’s worth. Unfortunately, the
Wildcats fell just a little short against
the talented UNCC 49ers. With the
score tied at 50 and under. seven min-
utes remaining in the game, UNCC
senior forward Galen Young took over,
scoring the 49ers’ next nine points.
Young’s outburst pushed UNCC out to
a 59-52 lead with 3:58 to play, and they
never looked back holding on for a 71-
62 victory. The Wildcats had plenty of
opportunities to put the game away but
shot only 30% from the field for the
night. The ‘Cats were led by Ali Ton’s
16 points and six assists. Emeka Erege
was also very impressive scoring a ca-
reer high 14 points and grabbing nine
rebounds. UNCC later defeated #3 Cin-
cinnati.

Belk Arena (Davidson, NC)

W 94-58

In the middle of exam week, the
Davidson Wildcats dominated Division
Ill Bowdoin College in every aspect of
the game, leading to a 36 point victory.
The outcome of the game was never in
doubt as the Wildcats built a 20 point
halftime lead. All of the ‘Cats scored in
the game, led by Ben Ebong’s 19 points
and nine rebounds. Chadd Holmes
and Davor Halbauer each scored 14
points. Ali Ton moved closer to the
Davidson career assist record with nine
assists in the game. Ebong brought the
crowd to life with two thunderous dunks,
one of them coming ona fast break from
an Ali Ton pass off of the backboard.

Davidson vs. Washington College
Saturday December 19th @ 3:00 PM
Belk Arena (Davidson, NC)

W 104-64

After a slow start, the Wildcats
exploded in the second half for a 40
point thrashing of Division III Wash-
ington College. The ‘Cats trailed by as
many as five in the first half before
closing out the last six minutes of the
half on a 15-7 run to go into the locker
room with a 41-35 lead.

Whatever coach Bob McKillop
told his players at halftime worked.

The ‘Cats came out of the locker room
on fire, outscoring Washington 40-13
over the first 11 minutes of the second
half.

Emeka Erege
led Davidson with
a career high 17
points. Landry
Kosmalski had 16
points and Ben
Ebong scored 14.
Michael Bree had
a great game off the
bench, scoring 10
points and tallying
four assists.

All 12 David-
son players on the
roster scored, and
the Wildcats con-
tinued to dominate
on the boards.

Mullins Center (Amherst, MA)

W 75-66 (OT)

Stunning. Des-
tined to be remem-
bered as one of the
most significant vic-
tories inthe McKillop
era, the Wildcats dem-
onstrated character
and poise in coming
from behind to shock
Bruiser Flint’s Min-
utemen, an Atlantic
10 powerhouse, in
overtime. Down 15
at the half (52-37) and
then 10 (58-48) with
just 5:56 to go, there
seemed no real possi-
bility for resuscita- °
tion. But then David-
son staged an epic
rally, highlighted by
Al? 'L6H'S "COast-to-
coast drives, Ben
Ebong's thunderous
baseline jam, and
high-flying Emeka
Erege’s critical of-
fensive tip in. The
‘Cats. outscored
UMASS 16-6 down
the stretch to send the
game to overtime.
Had Ali Ton’s last second bomb been
on the mark, there might not even have
been a need. Ton, dubbed “King of the
World,” by Davidson Wildcat radio
broadcaster Frank Santore, finished
with 14 points, 7 assists and 4 steals.

The Minutemen were no match
for the ‘Cats in the bonus period. De-
spite having two top players fouled out
(Stephen Marshall and Landry
Kosmalski), Davidson still outscored
UMASS 11-2 in the added frame. Hav-
ing lost all their momentum in regula-
tion, thanks in no small part to Lari
(with an “T’) Ketner’s abysmal 6-15
free throw shooting performance,
UMASS turned stone cold from the
field in overtime, going 0-9. :

Ebongled the ‘Cats with 17 points
and also collected 7 rebounds. Prior to
fouling out, Landry Kosmalski hauled
ina game high 12 boards. When all was
said and done in the post-game press
conference, Bruiser Flint, his players,
and all the UMASS fans had indeed
received an education: “It’s in North
Carolina, about 20 minutes north of
Charlotte, a small liberal arts school.”

Belk Arena (Davidson, NC)
W 82-73

In its nationally televised confer-
ence opener, a rematch of last year’s
Southern Conference tournament cham-
pionship, Davidson built an impressive
first-half lead, stretching to 21 points at
one time, and then successfully man-
aged to hold on for the win despite the
Mountaineers vaunted second half rally.

Ali Ton reeled off 11 straight
points out of the gate for Davidson,
leaving 3608 Belk Arena fans ecstatic
and App. St. uncertain as to their where-
abouts. App. St. gradually chipped
away, though, at Davidson’s 46-29 half-
time lead throughout the second half
until the ‘Cats led only 78-73 with thirty
two seconds remaining. Davidson was
able to seal the victory by scoring the
game’s final four points from the foul
line.

The Mountaineers’ Marshall
Phillips led all scorers with 23 points.
He also had 12 rebounds. Landry
“Special K” Kosmalski paced the ‘Cats
with 18 points and 14 boards, his sec-
ond straight double-double. Ali Ton
had 16 points, 4 assists and 2 steals.
Davor Halbauer poured in 14 points,
and Stephen Marshall contributed 13.

Davidson Wildcats vs. VMI
Monday January 4th @ 7:00PM
‘Cameron Hall (Lexington, VA)
W 85-64

Davidson opened up a three game
road trip in Lexington, Virginia with an
85-64 victory over VMI, stretching their
win streak to five. The Wildcats showed
their superior depth and balance with
four players scoring in double figures
and 11 players scoring in all. Ben
Ebong and Landry Kosmalski led the
‘Cats with 14 points each. Emeka
Erege and Davor Halbauer also con-
tributed 12.and 11 points, respectively.
Ebong also had 10 rebounds, rounding
out the double-double. Ali Ton contin-
ued his great all around play with six

points, 10 assists, five rebounds, and .

two steals. VMI was led by Jason
Bell’s 36 points, but the ‘Cats more
than made up for Bell’s performance
with their shooting andrebounding. The
‘Cats outrebounded the Keydets 47-21
and outshot them 54.5% to 35.4%. The
only negative to come out of the game
for the Wildcats was a late-game injury
to Jeff Bergmann. Bergmann went up

Saturday January 9th @ 7:30 PM
Memorial Center (Johnson City, TN)
L 82-75

The ‘Cats arrived at Memorial
Center in Johnson City on January 9th
with continuity on their minds. The
plan was simple enough: They would
conquer ETSU for the eighth straight
time, and bolster their current winning
streak to six games in a row on the
season and seventeen straight in the
Southern Conference. It would all be
quick and easy. Only someone forgot
to tell ETSU’s senior forward Greg
Stephens.

In “the zone” from the moment he
stepped on the floor, Stephens scorched
the ‘Cats until the final buzzer. He
finished with 31 points, shooting 11-17
from the field. To call him prolific
would be an understatement. “He made
some extraordinary shots. I tip my hat
to him. There aren’t too many college
players who have nights like that,” said
Davidson skipper Bob McKillop.

Which is not to say that Davidson

. Was never close in the game. The ‘Cats

in fact went to the locker room up a
point, 42-41. The lead came .thanks
mainly to “Big Dog”
Ben Ebong’s mon-
strous 17 point first
half scoring perfor-
mance. ButETSU’s
halftime chalk ses-
sion seemingly
worked wonders as
Ebong was held to
just two points inthe
second half, finish-
ing with 19 in total,
along with 11 re-
bounds (his second
consecutive double-
double).

If Ebong’s offen-
sive proficiency dis-
appeared in the sec-
ond half, he was not
alone among the
‘Cats. Tied 48-48
early in the second
frame, the ‘Cats
watched ETSU reel
off 13 straight unan-
swered points.
McKillop could
only shake his head
in, frustration and
utter disbelief as
ETSU connected on
nearly everything
they threw up down the stretch.

The ‘Bucs finished 57% from the
field (53% from
behind the 3point
arc), and 68%
from the line.

Down 73-63
with approxi-
mately three anda
half minutes left
in regulation,
McKillop and his
troops had all but
packed their bags

lead to a mere bucket. But it was not to
be.

A low-post entry pass got lost
somewhere in the Johnson City night,
and 3475 rowdy ETSU ‘Bucs fans
climbed to their feet for a hearty, long
awaited shout of triumph. Davidson
could only play out an ineffectual score
and foul strategy until the final buzzer
sounded and confirmed the end to their
Johnson City win streak.

Davidon’s Landry Kosmalski fin-
ished with 14 points and 6 rebounds.
Emeka Erege fouled out late in the
game after contributing 10 points and 6
rebounds. Chadd Homes chipped in 10
points in just 15 minutes of action. Ali
Ton handed out 7 assists on the night,
leaving him just one shy of the all-time
Davidson Wildcat record. ETSU’s
Reggie Todd had 13 points and 6 re-
bounds to complement Stephens’s ef-
forts.

Monday January 11th, 1999.7:30 PM
Fleming Gym (Greensboro, NC)
L 73-67

The ‘Cats ran into’ fits trying to
dismantle UNCG’s solid zone defense,
and ultimately proved incapable. David-
son led only once in the game, 26-25.
The Spartans bolstered their 32-30 half-
time lead with a 16-5 run over the first
five and a half minutes of the second
half. Davidson staged a number of late
rallies, bombing away from 3-pt. land
at a clip of 10 for 29 on the night, but
came up short. The ‘Cats shot only 43%
from the line, while the Spartans shot
85%. Emeka Erege, due to early foul
trouble, was limited to only sixteen
minutes of action, finishing with 0 points
and just | rebound.

In humbling Davidson, UNCG
eamed its first Southern Conference
victory of the season. Sophomore guard
Nathan Jameson led the Spartans with
23 points. For Davidson, Ben Ebong
earned his third straight double-double
with a 14 point, 10 rebound perfor-
mance. Landry Kosmalski had a
double-double of his own, scoring 13
points and hauling in 14 rebounds.
Davor Halbauer chipped in 12 points
and Michael Bree finished with a ca-
reer high 11.

Seemingly lost amidst the ‘Cats
dismal performance was the celebra-
tion of Ali Ton’s breaking the all-time
Davidson Wildcats assist record, previ-
ously held by Chris Alpert ‘96. Enter-
ing the game against UNCG, Ton needed
only two assists to break the record.
The Turkish born senior point guard
finished with 11, along with 9 points
and 5 steals.
