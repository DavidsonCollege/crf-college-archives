The Davidsonian

At the Southern Conference
Championship swim meet, the
Davidson College swim team
made a good showing, finishing
sixth out of eight teams in the
strong 8s conference.

Better yet, Davidson's
overall improvement this year
helped bring Coach Pat Miller
coach of the year honors.

Coach Miller was humble
about her title. ‘‘Becoming
coach of the year was a tribute
to the hard work of the team.”

But more than one swim-
mer, including Captain Mike
Knowles, had plenty of praise.
“She did a super job all year.
That’s all there is to it.”

Davidson’s sixth place
finish is a bit deceiving, as the
team doubled the number of
points of previous years.

“Everyone did real well. A real
team performance, just like all
year,” said Coach Miller..
Outstanding swimmers in
the meet included Mark
Tommerdahl, who broke the
conference record in winning

the 200 butterfly, as well as a
sixth in the 400 IM and ‘seventh
in the 100 butterfly.

Jonathan Washburn
grabbed a second, a third, and a
fourth in the 200 breaststroke,
the 400 IM and the 200 IM

respectively. All were school
records, as were Tommerdahl’s
finishes. Coach Miller quickly
pointed out, “‘I have to point out
one or two swimmers. Just
about everyone placed in their
events.”’

For the year, the team was
outstanding in finishing 11-4,
one of Davidson’s few winning
teams, they broke 15 school
records (out of 20 events) and
set eight pool records. “We
should have had them all,’’ said
Coach Miller, ‘‘We’ll get them
next year,”

The future.. The swim
team loses only one swimmer to
graduation, and prospects from
the class of 1981 look good. The
team is already into weight
training the same program as
the football team.

The club water polo season
will begin soon. Coach Miller
urges anyone interested to
come out.

to happen because of financial
questions,’ Cartmill said, and
then suggested that Davidson
may find itself in a favorable
situation. He stressed that the
federal government has not
finalized Title IX regulations,
but it is possible that schools
may have to fund the athletics
of men and women equally.

Presently, Davidson has
grants-in-aid for basketball
only. If Title IX eventually
requires equal funding, only the
women’s basketball program
would be affected. No other
program, men’s or women’s,
gives grants, so no other sport
would be affected. Thus, there
would be a need only for a
minimal amount of additional
funds.

However, a school which
presently has grants in many
sports would either have to
sharply increase its athletic
budget or decrease the number
of scholarship sports if Title IX
requires equal funding of
grants. Cartmill believes that
many small schools could not
support the increased financial
burden and ‘“‘may have to go to
a program similar to David-
son’s.”’

Cartmill indicated that
some schools have already
begun to examine the Davidson
program.

If other schools, par-’
ticularly those in the Southeast,
alter their programs, Davidson
would once again evaluate its
membership in the Southern
Conference. Many colleges and
universities in the country are
expected to examine the
relationship with their

ve conference. If the
financial situation radically
changes, possibly causing a
major shake-up in the league
system .as it presently exists.
