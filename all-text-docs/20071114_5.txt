Shampoo Disguised as
Conditioner, Body Wash

A recent investigation of the hair
product industry has rocked the
nation, according to Cosmo and
other reliable sources.

Shampoo giants Pert Plus,
Tresemme and Loreal have all been
indicted by DEA _ inspectors.
Conclusive evidence shows that
these companies’ alleged sham-
poos, conditioners, and body wash-
es all come from the same vat of
warm liquid goo.

Lather-gate, as the scandal has
been termed, came to light last
Friday off of an insider tip.

The other major finding of the
investigation is that Irish Spring
Sport, reputed to be the natural
Celtic cleanser, actually contains
highly diluted Elmer’s glue, bottles
its products in Hackensack and
bears no legitimate connection to
the Republic of Ireland. It was also
found to exacerbate dandruff.

Study Shows Friday Actually the

Ironic Play of the Week:

Camouflage Conspicuous

William Jahnes III '09 was
forced to wake up after only two
hours of sleep in order to go to his
8:30a.m.
class last
Thursday.

This
was due,
quite sim-
ply, to his
outfit. A
member

r= of ROTC,
Will Jahnes’s uniform Jahnes is

makes him an easy required
target for professors. tg wear
his unique camouflage uniform
every Tuesday and Thursday.

The garish green and black
fatigues render him extremely con-
spicuous, making it impossible not
to notice his absence in his early
morning class, The Vietnam
Experience.

Letters to the Editors

From a broad

Hey everyone at Davidson! I'm
a broad in Paris, France. I like

baguettes, sleeping with artists and
strolling by the Capitole de
Toulouse at night. My lovers
include Gerard Depardien, Laurent
Blanc, Nick Carter and the milk-
boy, Pierre.

The lovely Ms. Claudine Cargot, a
broad and well on the Left Bank.

I listen to Euro-pop and love that
new hit, “I'll never break your
heart” by le Backstreet Boys. I
have pin-ups of them all over my
loft on the Boulevard san Michelle,
just off the Latin Quarter, where
one can score un peau la " sniffer.”

Anyway, I'm writing because
I'm actually always going to be a
broad, and I wanted to know if any
eligible bachelor from Davidson
wanted to come over and get to
know me, a broad, for a semester
or maybe even a year!

Write me back if interested. But
I don’t want any of these platonic
pen pals, okay? Au revior!

Not from a broad

Hey guys. I want to clear some-
thing up. I'm not a broad. Don't
even think that I am a broad. I live
in Ryburn with all my boys and we
throw down every weekend here at
Davidson.

This dude is definately not a broad.

I really don’t know how people
could think I’m a broad. You peo-
pla are clearly confused. Broads
are into cosmetics and money and
stuff. What do I do for fun? Oh,
the usual. I bowl. Drive around.
The occasional acid flashback. I’m
fairly into white Russians.
Sometimes we play North-South,
which is like the Civil War but with
kegs instead of cannons. Same
amount of casualties though. I
digress.

I’ve had a rough month. I'd real-
ly appreciate it if people would
stop mistaking me for being a
broad. And if whoever pissed on
my couch would get me some
money, that would be great. Later,

guys.

Greatest Day to be a Wildcat

Numerous campus organizations
will be forced to make some criti-
cal changes to the literature that
has been produced stating, “It's a
great day to be a Wildcat!”

According to a new study con-

“Mondays, contrary to
Admissions’ reports, are not great
days to be a Wildcat,” Dirk
Chuzlewit said.

ducted by the Sociology
Department, many days, but not all
days, are great days to be a
Wildcat.

The study, which involved near-
ly two-thirds of the student body,
reported, for example, that Monday
is not necessarily a great day to be
a Wildcat. —

One participant in the study, sen-
ior History Major Chris Hoffens,
commented, “False: Mondays are
not a great day to be a Wildcat.
Mondays are a great day to be a
hermit and go to the library and

think about your lack of time man-
agement skills concerning working
over the weekend. Go put that in a
brochure.”

Head of the Sociology
Department Dr. Michael Cook
reported that Friday is actually the
greatest day to be a Wildcat.

“Friday is really when the magic
happens. Throughout the week the
students are more like little tame
kittens. But then, all the studying
stops for the big night and every-
one turns into the wildest of wild-
cats all over campus. It's truly
something special to watch them
evolve.”

Dr. Cook then let out an awk-
ward and unsuccessful growl.

Many students expressed frustra-
tion at being patronized by such
Admissions Office catchphrases.

“What are we, like, six-years-
old?” Economics major Dirk
Chuzlewit ‘08 said. “No matter
what day of the week it is, ’'m
going to fail my econometrics
problem set, lose a recently bought
pen and suffer from _post-
Commons indigestion, if I don’t
have my: lunch money stolen by
those Phi Delts.”

“Tn fact, I’ve never felt paricular-
ly thirlled to be a Wildcat. I prefer
to dwell on the futility of true love,
the absence of a god in this existen-
tialist void and the certainty that
we will all die alone.”

Mary Baldwin Obliterated

by Men’s

ee

A pre-game shot of the Mary aldwin team, which was losing 164-5 to

Basketball Team

the Davidson College Men’s Basketball team when the game was aban-

doned late in the second half.

In the largest margin of victory «
of any sporting event in NCAA his-
tory, the Davidson College Men’s
Basketball Team trounced the
Mary Baldwin Women’s team by
over 150 points last Monday night.

The game was a scheduling mis-
take, Mary Baldwin Coach Edward

Hillmore said. He had curiously
outfitted his team in Victorian era
frocks with the intention to com-
pete against Hollins College.

It is the first time in any basket-
ball competition that a team
would still have lost were its score
raised to the third power.
