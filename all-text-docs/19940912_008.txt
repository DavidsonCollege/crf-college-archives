‘he most tragic lesson is one

Sstirdays were my favorite.
We'd sit in the game room of his
house, and I’d watch college foot-
ball while he put together model

-airplanes. Later, we would learn
that airplanes weren’t as magical as
we once thought.

I was 16 then—an age where
teenage girls are difficult, ifnotclose
to impossible. I was no different.
My parents seemed incredibly pro-
tective and strict and I felt incred-
ibly grown-up and mature. My sav-
ing grace in those years was
Michael’s house. His parent’s be-
came my own, and soon I was the
third child, joining in on family va-
cations, dinners, and church ser-
vices.

I knew the family stories as
well as the boys. The parents were
young loves; they married, moved
into atrailer, and struggled to make
ends meet. He hitchhiked to work
and school and she skipped lunch
because they couldn’ t afford it. Ev-
ery few weeks, the typewriter would
be pawned for groceries until they
could afford to buy it back. Years

passed by, and still madly in love,
they began a family and eventually
moved up in the world. He became
the chief of the Internal Revenue
Service’s Criminal Intelligence Di-
vision in Columbia and she became
the executive secretary to the presi-
dent of the premier bank. After his
retirement, he became a contractor

from both him and his parents.

In the following years, I keptin
touch with them—never to the ex-
tent of my high school years when I
so desperately appreciated their
parenting of me, but what I felt was
enough: cards atanniversaries, birth-
days, and holidays, and an occa-
sional phone call when I was feeling

from the evening news; they were
only flying away forthe night. The
funeral would be near the end of the
week; the investigators needed time
to identify the bodies.

I walked around the next few
days ina strange trance. My parents
called and asked me to come home,
and all I could do was mumble that

hard work and love as the strongest
ingredients to their success.

I learned in those years that
simply being a good person had its
merit; people who were kind and.
compassionate did not always re-
ceive an ugly piece of life. I learned
that love could be an incredible force
and that happiness was a state of
mind rather than a state of life. And
when the time came for Michael
and Ito move on, as many first loves
must do, I did so knowing that I had
been blessed with valuable lessons

especially reminiscent.

It was a Saturday that it hap-
pened. Saturdays were still my fa-
vorite days. On Sunday, the phone
rang and my sister whispered to me
that they had died in the plane crash
in Charlotte, Flight 1016. [hung up,
abruptly. I wandered aimlessly,
struggling to understand what had
happened, how these two people,
my other parents, could have died.

The phone call that followed
was out of some distorted night-
mare. He told me how he found out

Dating and

the ideal

Dating used to be quite simpler
in the old days. At seven, [had my
first date on the bus when Laura
Veighte and her pig-tailed auburn
hair sat down next to me and pro-
ceeded to gross me out by smiling
at me. We were alone (in the seat
at least), in close proximity to each
other (bus seats are small), and
made trivial banter (Move over!
No, make me!). And then, she was
my girlfriend for the next 27 min-
utes, or at least that’s what my
friends told me.

Here at Davidson, dating and
relationships are significantly
trickier. A comment about rela-
tionships I remember hearing as a
freshman was that “most people at
Davidson are either married or ter-

ribly single,” to which I shrugged °

and proceeded to repress that
thought into the back of my mind.
I had envisioned a dating pattern

similar to those I had seen on T.V.
shows like the now-defunct “Class
of °96”:

GUY: Could you tell
me where my Advanced Polymer-
ization Techniques freshman
colloquium is? :

GAL #1: Oooh, are youin
that class? I think a guy who
knows something about advanced
polymerization techniques is terri-
bly sexy.

GAL #2: Me too. | espe-
cially love men who know their
Bohr’s Theorem.

GUY: Ladies, please.
I’m gonna be late.

I think my misconception
about college dating comes from
my cousin Tom, who once told me,
“Tony, there comes a time where a
woman wants a man not for his
body, but rather for his mind.”
Little did I realize that Tom, as

successful as he is as a biochemist,
is a situational bachelor (not by
choice), owns several fish, and has
an affinity for the telecommunica-
tions industries.

I think that the problem that
people have at Davidson is their
inability to strike up conversation
with members of the opposite sex.
Perhaps they lack that clever intro-
duction that can possibly lead to
more conversation, an exchange
of dorm locations, and a small pri-
vate ceremony on an island. off
Uganda. Here are some sugges-
tions: ;

At the library, a guy can walk
up toa girl reading Tolstoy and say
“Hey, whatcha doing? You read-
ing that crazy Tolstoy guy?” Per-
haps in the classroom, a guy can
approach a girl reviewing her notes

The funeral was on a perfect
summer day. “Amazing Grace”
and two hearses riding through the
streets of Columbia side by side still
flash in my memory. There was a
hitchhiker on the road, and I re-
member wondering if his tale was
like theirs. I rode home afterwards,
my parent’s grown child suddenly
young again, and gently thanked
them forall they had done and apolo-
gized for all that I had failed to do.
The sunset that night was beautiful

as I drove back to North Carolina;
two birds flying side by side moved
me to tears.

Months later, I still do not un-
derstand why two young men were
abruptty left as orphans. I don’t
understand why it took a tragedy to
make me apologize to my parents
for my difficulttimes or why Ididn’t
express my love toall four of them—
his parents and my own—more

_ openly. I don’t understand why I

haven’tstopped shaking whenThear .
the mention of an airplane or why I
can’t go home to Columbia without
feeling a wave of melancholy, nau-
sea, or fear overwhelm me.

What! dounderstandis simple.
When you love, you express it.
When you are thankful, you ac-
knowledge it. When you appreci-
ate, you identify it. When you are
wrong, you admit it. When you are
fortunate, you remember it. When
you are kind, solely for the worth of
compassion—as they both were—
you shall prosper in the most appro-
priate and beautiful way. Itshouldn’t
take a tragedy to learn.

The Amputation Diet Plan

Forcing a community to act like one does not foster solidarity

B, the time this article is pub-
lished, we will have experienced
our first “Fall Festival.” I suppose
that the ideals behind this wild and
crazy event may appear fairly noble.
The approach to and eventual goal
of this event, however, remain im-
practical and unfair. ;
Sure, it would be great if everyone
on campus got along like one, big,
happy family, but why should this
goal take precedentoverevery other
social organization already in place?
What makes this little shindig so
special that it should prevent other
organizations fromcarrying on their
normal activities?

This type of dictation is not

only unfair, but unrealistic. You
cannot force people into complete,
undivided social harmony. People
naturally form themselves into
groups so they can focus their free
time on the people whose company
they enjoy the most.

These divisions do not mean that
we are intolerant but merely that we
show preferences in whom wechoose™
as friends, You cannot simply throw
everyone into a room and say, “Get
along now; this is an all-campus festi-
val.” What do they expect, the entire
student body of Davidson standing on
topofahill somewhere, holding hands
and singing “T’d like to buy the world
a Coke!?” ‘

Perhaps the reason I am most
upset about this weekend lies in that
there will be no KA parties. Ihad no
ideauntil Nick Troiano’s comments
in last week’s Davidsonian that KA
“provides much of the total social
activity for the entire school.” I
cannot imagine what I have been
doing for the last two years that] am
just now finding that out.

Unfortunately, these social
goliaths will be shut down this week-
end, along with every other fraternity
and eating house because of the “Fall
Festival.” Without a KA fiesta this
weekend, what will we do for fun?

To greatly improve the “Fall
Festival,” Isuggest that the SGA co-

sponsor it with KA. This way,
every last student will be dying to
attend. We could still enjoy the

‘regatta and the day atthe lake. Then,

at night, there could be an all-cam-
pus/KA blowout where the band is
instructed only to play “YMCA,”

’ “ABC,” and “Macho Man” (plus a

few assorted trendy dance tunes),
and all the beer runs out by 10:15
p.m. Wait, I forgot: the “Fall Fes-
tival” is a non-alcoholic event. Oh
well, I doubt the KA crowd would

want to drink milkshakes all night,”

so I guess that plan will not work.
That is too bad.

Nobody can possibly lump an
entire student body as diverse as

Davidson’s into a huge, homog-
enous group: not the SGA, not the
Union, and certainly not any one
fraternity or eating house. People
are different. People have different
interests and concepts of entertain-
ment. This diversity is precisely the
reason Davidson has seven distinct
fraternities, three seperate eating
houses, and countless clubs and or-
ganizations. Let us not stifle indi-
viduality and assorted interests for
some distant and unlikely ideal.
After all, solidarity is not fostered
by lumping everyonetogetherintoa
dull, milkshake-drinking mass, min-
gling merely because there is noth-
ing else to do.
