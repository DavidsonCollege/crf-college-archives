Panel to examine
media's role in society

Courtesy of College Relations
This Friday, education and
media leaders from North Caro-
lina and across the country will
take part in two different panel
discussions on the role of the me-
dia in modern society. Part of the
program of the-38th annual meet-
ing of Davidson’s Board of Visi-
tors, the discussions will be open
to interested members of the stu-
dent body, faculty, and staff. They
will be held in the Multipurpose

Room of Chambers on April 15.
During the first panel discus-
sion, “The Media and Children,”
panelists will discuss the role of
the media as educator, entertainer,
and vendor, specifically in its im-
pact on three different age groups:
preschoolers, elementary school
students, and teenagers. The panel

will run from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

Court houses disregard sanitation regulations

Court continued from page 1

der the category of "hand
dishwashing facilities." In such
facilities, the law mandates “an
approved three-compartment sink
of sufficient size and depth fo sub-
merge, wash, rinse and sanitize
utensils and shall have splash back
protection and drain boards that
are an integral part of a continuous

with the sink.” These drain boards —

must be of sufficient size to ac-
commodate the drying of all the
washed eating utensils. .

This scenario is not a reality at
the houses on Patterson Court.
While their sinks are of sufficient
size and depth to perform the nec-

essary dishwashing functions,
some sinks have only two basins
instead of the required three. In
addition, most of the houses, in-
cluding Kappa Sigma and Connor
House, do not even have drain
boards or their equivalents on
which to dry washed dishes. Kappa
Alpha and Pi Kappa Alpha have
drying racks, but they are not nearly
large enough to handle all of the
dishes and utensils used in a single
meal. .

The actual washing of the
plates, cups, and silverware must,
according to Section 2619 of the
Statute include sanitizing after
cleaning and rinsing. They must
either be immersed “for at least

ling to what you really need to
know.” She points to the books
that Kaplan gives its students as
the most beneficial part of the
course,

Suter believes that no real dif-
ference exists between the two:
“They both havea lotto offer. You
get out of it what you put into it.”

The Law Suit

Recently, the two companies
have locked horns over an ad that
Kaplan placed in U.S. News
& World Report .

The Kaplan ad claims that a
free refresher course will be of-
tered to any student whose scores
do not improve by an established
amount after taking the Kaplan
course. Princeton Review sees this
declaration as a direct violation of
the agreement that the two compa-
nies made in 1993 stating that nei-
ther would report score improve-
ments without substantial verifi-
cation.

Kaplan defends its claims with
documentation from a major ac-
ounting firm and says Princeton

Review's accusations are misdi- .

ected. Melissa Mack, public rela-
ions director for Princeton Re-
‘lew, says that the data published

derstood.
Should you even take a course?

As lawyers argue over logis-
tics and fine print, students just
want advice on the best path to
take.

Carol Jordan, director of Ca-
teer Services at Davidson, does
not see a need for all students to
spend money on intense prepara-
tory courses like Kaplan and
Princeton Review. According to
Jordan, Davidson students who
have a good GPA, who do not have
high test-taking anxiety, and who
scored fairly well on the SAT
should be able to prepare for gradu-
ate entrance exams with a store-
bought study guide.

Jordan recommends prep
courses only for those students who
do not have a strong GPA or who
are not confident test takers, She
recommends both Kaplan and
Princeton Review but also. sug-
gests that students look into shorter,
less expensive courses offered at
most colleges. Jordan hopes that
all juniors are beginning to think
about entrance exams because the
best time to take them is the sum-
mer before the senior year. Her
advice to those who want to take a
prep course before. the exam is:
“Be wary of high prices, for these

are.allcompetitivebusinesses. Try ‘

to come up with many options.”

one minute . . . in clean hot water at
a temperature of at least 170° F” or
held “for at least two minutes... in
achemical bactericide of astrength
approved by the Department.”
None of these sanitizing measures
are practiced by the dish-washers
at the eating houses. Even when
steps are taken to sanitize plates
and utensils, such as Connor’s add-
ing of chlorine tablets to the rinse

water or Pi Kappa Alpha’s final
dipping of washed dishesintociean
water, they are notstringent enough

.to comply with the law’s require-

ments.
General Statute 130A-249 als also

contains guidelines regarding the
kitchen floors and counters. Only
Rusk and Sigma Phi Epsilon had
floors and counters that were both
visibly clean and dirt-free to the
touch.

Most of the counters. were
fairly clean, but the majority of the
floors were not sanitary enough to
pass an inspection based on these
regulations.

At Kappa Sigma, for example,
there’ was ‘food "encrusted on" the
Stove top, and the floor was so
dirty that students walking from
the kitchen to the dining room no-

cosy tracked dirt on the floor.

The Rusk kitchen, the only house that passed the sanitation
guidelines, is kept cleaner than the rest.

The Board of Visitors is not a
part of the governance system of
the college, but itenables Davidson
to develop ties outside the normal
circlé of alumni and current stu-
dent families. An annual meeting
at the college acquaints members
with what is going on at Davidson
and in higher education in general.
This year, the general topic for the
meeting will be “Set free the in-
quiring mind, the expressive
spirit!”
