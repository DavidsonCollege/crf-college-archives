ments of these two men the general manager of WCNT, John Wood-
stock, said that he had not heard about the statements made during the
interview with Mitchell.. He did not appear surprised at McGuffin and
Clarke’s comments and explained that he has talked with them several
times about past remarks. Woodstock said, “They’re not destined to stay
on the air too long.”

Woodstock also said that the comments of McGuffin and Clarke do
notnecessarily represent the station’s views. He commented on how the
two hosts sometimes present their opinions in the wrong light.

Mitchell was obviously upset about how these two men acted during
the interview. “The D¥’s were ignorant about the issue,” said Mitchell,
“Into the Streets is not to go out and change the world, but to make
students aware.”

Mitchell said, “I hope that something, at least awareness has come
out of this.”

Mary Faith Mount, Président of Habitat for Humanity said, “Their
(McGuffin and Clarke) comments about Davidson students were wrong,
and the people who slept out were not who they were talking about.” She
added that their views on homelessness were “unfounded and wrong.”

Around forty people attended the midnight vigil in front of Cham-
bers and about twenty-two stayed and slept on the wet lawn last
Wednesday night. Newsreporters from channel nine interviewed Reach
Out President Kathy Beach about the sleep out and channel three filmed
part of the midnight vigil.

the old Warner Hall house. Sarah
Way explained that they would
like to have sixty committed
members before self-selection
night, butreally wanta strong group
of first-year students to set Connor
rolling.

Way carefully explained
that if freshwomen self-select
Connor and the roll totalled only
fifty-nine members, then the com-
puter would restart the process from
scratch.

The computer would revert the
Connor names back to the other
three houses. So no risk would be
involved as far as choosing a house
that may not yet exist.

House meetings are Mon-
day’s at 6:45 in the old Warner
Hall house and are open to all
potential members.

problems occur and then treats
them.

The result is a more environ-
mentally safe campus, but the lack
of pesticides means that the cam-
pus may not always look “shiny
and bright,” Brawley said. He
believes that the “intelligent aca-
demicicommunity understands the
need to be protective of the envi-
ronment.” Random spraying of
pesticides can eventually lead to
contamination of water supplies
and other problems.

Davidson’s concern for the
environment hasn’t raised the cost
of caring for the campus, but proba=
bly hasn’t reduced the expense
either. The biggest tradeoff for
using the environmentally safe
methods is in the reaction time of
the fertilizers. Chemically based
fertilizers have much quicker reac-
tion times, while natural fertilizers
are slower acting.

The natural fertilizer that has
been so noticeable this past week
is “composted turkey litter.”
Brawley says that the material is a

combination of turkey manure and
shavings which is high in Nitro-
gen, Potassium, and Phosphorous.
Brawley added that the grounds
crew did not expect the fertilizer to
be as odorous as it has been.

Brawley made the point that
Davidson’s maintenance methods
could not be considered strictly
“organic.” Rather, the grounds
crew always tries to do what will
be least damaging to the environ-
ment. Sometimes herbicides are
used, which are not organic, to
treat certain types of disease and
weeds.

Brawley’s commitment to the
environmentled to national televi-
sion coverage on “Good Moming
America” last summmer. At the
time of the segment, Congress was
discussing a bill which would re-
strict pesticide use. The Davidson
campus was used to show that pes-
ticides were not necessary for
maintaining an attractive land-
scape.

George Morris, the Supervisor
of Grounds, oversees a mainte-
nance crew of 13 full-time em-
ployees. They are responsible for
overseeing all 85 acres of the front
campus.
