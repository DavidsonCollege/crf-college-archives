In the fifties and early sixties the
EP was the most popular form of vinyl.
Back then people hardly ever bought
albums, so if they wanted more songs
than a 45 had to offer, they turned to
the four- to six-song extended play.

But during the late sixties and
seventies individual songs got longer
and longer, until eventually bands like
Iron Butterfly could fill entire album
sides with only one song.

Ironically, that embarassingly
popular music, disco, contributed to
the EP’s revival with “disco versions.”
These “extended length dance ver-
sions” touted the length of an album
with only one song; the search for a
middle ground was inevitable.

As the eighties neared, labels such
as I.R.S. and Columbia decided that
the masses wanted to hear new bands
again. So instead of spending a lot of
money on albums, EPs became a
means of “testing” a band.

Guadalcanal Diary

There are many hot EPs out now.
Guadalcanal Diary’s Watusi Radio
seems to be a harmless investigation of
the shape of things to come. As if to ac-
knowledge the good idea punk had (al-
though unlistenable and depressingly
simple), and the too-popular swing in
the other direction — new wave (also

unlistenable and depressingly simple),
GD has hit upon a pleasant com-
promise.

“Michael Rockefeller,” the disc’s
highlight, is a mixture of sturdy, qual-
ity drumming, and harsh yet adeptly
played guitar and bass, providing a
complementary background to Murray
Attaway’s lulling vocals.

“John Wayne,” another marvelous
piece, is the lament of one tough
hombre who was the king of the hill
until said Mr. Wayne arrived on the
scene. The rolling refrains of “I wish I
killed John Wayne” offer shades of
hardcore punk, but the instrumentali-
zation and wit offer a happy alterna-
tive.

The Method Actors
Athens, Georgia is slowly garner-

ing for itself a reputation for producing
insanely popular bands. The town that
brought us Love Tractor, Pylon, the B-
52’s, and R.E.M. has a new local to-
mato made good — The Method Ac-
tors.

Their new EP, “Live In a Room,”
is an exciting piece of funk-punk-
avant-garde. Consisting of nothing but
a drum/bass rhythm section and a
saxophone, their music explores the
distant realms of experimentalism.

Songs such as “Eye” rest on a
happy medium that somehow com-
bines minimalism with a lushness re-
miniscent of the Psychedelic Furs or
the Talking Heads. The deliberate yet
musical bass and drum act as an anchor
straining to hold the playful saxophone
in check. The cheesy, cheapo, spy, B-
movie genre of theme music 1s per-
fectly epitomized and satirized on
another noteworthy song, “Detec-
tive.”

Although good, the music is not
the best the Method Actors have
played. It will most likely achieve
popularity among the true lovers of un-
usual music.

Jason and Co.

Jason and the Nashville Scorchers
combine all the best qualities of
straightforward rock, southern rock,
and country. Fervor is testament.

Extended Play Albums Test New Bands

Electric guitar played with uncom-
promising precision and lucidity can
be heard on “Both Sides of the Line”

(co-written by front man Jason
Richenberg and R.E.M.’s Michael
Stipe — hmm) along with the twangy
guitar and characteristic voice cracks
of country.

“Pray for Me Momma (I’m a
Gypsy Now),” on the other hand, is
unaltered country that would find ap-
proval only with the most ardent fan.
But the best juxtaposition of musical
styles can be found on “Help There’s a
Fire,” with its pedal steel guitar and
undaunted ravings “Every time I look
at you I yell, ‘Help, there’s a fire.’”

If Jason’s new style finds any kind
of favor, he and his band will be just as
their name implies, scorchers.
