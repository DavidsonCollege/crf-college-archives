Student Body to Spend One Day In|Social and Personal Items About| Davidson Five Meets “Green Ma-

Charlotte.

Though all arrangements have not
been completed. extensive plans are be-
ing made to have the entire Davidson
student body attend the Laymen's Con-
vention which is to be held in Charlotte,
February 16, 17 and 18.

Since the theme chosen for the second
day of the convention, Wednesday, the
17th, is one that will be of particular
interest to students, that date has been
selected by President Martin and the
Faculty as the one on which the student
body will be urged to attend en masse.

Special rates and a special train will
be secured for the trip. The train will
leave early on the morning of the 17th,
probably at 7:30 a. m., and will return
that night after the conclusion of the
services of the day. Dr. Martin an-
nounces also that any of the students
who desire to attend the other exercises
on Tuesday and ‘Vhursday will, upon
application, have permission granted
them to do so.

In order to pay necessary expenses
a fee of one dollar will be charged those
attending the convention, but an effort
will be made to have the student body
exempted from this fee, and it is prac-
tically certain that they will not have to
pay it.

Ample arrangements have been made
for the entertainment of the great num-
ber of visitors who will attend the con-
vention from all sections of the country,
and an interesting and highly beneficial
program has been arranged. :

The Laymen’s Movement, which ha:
become of world-wide importance as a
factor in Christian work, is, as its namc
indicates, an organization of the jay
members of the Church and has on its
roll men in all walks of life who are
taking an intense interest in its work
and aims and are deriving great and
lasting benefit from it.

Since its conventions are held only
every two vears, the opportunity to at-
tend should be taken advantage of by
every student who can do so and all are
urged to make ,plans to be present at
some of the meetings at least,( if not at
all of them.

NEW PLAN FOR MEETING
OF Y. M. C..A. CABINETS

A new plan was started last Sundav
by which the Y. M. C. A. cabinets will
meet at certain times ar the home of
each. member of the faculty advisory
board in turn. The meeting last Sun-
day night was at the home of Dr. Sen-
telle, and was thoroughly enjoyed by
each member of the cabinet.

A report was given by the chairman
of each department. of the work done
up to the present time, and new plans
and aims were discussed.

The help given by Dr. Sentelle is
much appreciated by each member of the
cabinet. and the new plan is heartily
endorsed.

ALUMNI BANQUET

On February 17. the second day of
the Laymen’s Convention, a Davidson

The sport lovers of Davidson will be
interested to learn that the management
of the basket ball team has completed ar-
rangements for the staging of a contest
with the Charlotte Y. M. C. A. in the
Gymnasium ‘Vhursday afternoon, This
is a new era for Davidson, an awakening
of “pep” along a new line, for it: has
been many vears since so much interest
has been taken in’ basket hall here, and
this will be the first game played on the
Hill in vears.

Vhe Charlotte team comes here high
ly recommended as a fast, clean aggrega-
tion, and when the “Red and Black”
quintet meets the “Green Machine,” a
tast and exciting game is promised.

Charlotte has met both A. & ML. and
‘Trinity this  vear, and) each time has
come out with the big end of the score in
their favor. Stuart, who has made such
a record for himself at forward — tor
Charlotte, will be seen in action on the
local floor, and he is considered one ot
the fastest and surest men in the State.
Davenport, at center, is the pivot on
which the “Green Machine” works, and
his playing will be watched with much
interest.

The game here ‘Vhursday is a trial for
Davidson basket ball. and the interest
taken by the student hody body will de-
termine the life of the great indoor sport.

‘The team returned from a short trip
last week, and, considering the amount
of practice up to that time, and the
handicap of inferior equipment in th:
gymnasium, the trip was very successful.
The loss of Sominerville at forward for
the locals was very keenly felt, he being
unable to make the trip. Since last
week the team has been getting in some
hard practice and is fast rounding into
shane.

Davidson has always been a contender
for State championship in foot ball and
base ball, but little interest has been
taken in basket ball. All the schools in
the State are putting out strong teams,
and Davidson must not be outdone, The
team deserves hearty encouragement
from the student body.

Class Championship
Game Results in Tie

Juniors and Sophs Scrap Fiercely
to 0-6 Score.

Last Saturday afternoon at 3:45 the
Juniors and Sophs lined up to fight out
the class foot ball championship, and
truly it was a fight from beginning to
end. ‘There were very few long runs
and forward passes executed, straight
line plunges seeming to be the mainstay
ot both teams. The Juniors were pen-
alized almost the length of the field for
being off-side continually. Both teams
fought like demons on the defence, but
neither showed up much on the offence.
The fact that the game ended in a tie
goes to prove that it was a battle royal.

McKeithan and Pair played the best
game for the Juniors. Porter was de-

Feidedly the Sophs’ best ground gainer,

while Ratchford plaved the best offen-
sive game for them.

Firse Quarter: “The Sophs won the
toss and chase to defend the southern
goal, Alford kicked off to their five-yard
line, and Keesler failed to return. “The
Juniors held for a series of line plunges
avhich were directed against it, and then
Sparrow blocked a punt and fell on the
ball on the Sophs’ ten-yard line. But
now that a touchdown was fairly in
sight, the Juniors seemed unable to push
the ball over. The Sophs were fighting
like fury and held the Juniors for four
downs; the ball) went over, and the
Sophs punted out of danger.

Second Quarter: ‘Phe ball see-sawed
up and down the field. neither side gain-
ing enough ground to make the _ first
down. When the Sophs did make it, it
was due to the fact that the Juniors were
penalized, Both sides punted most of
the time.

Third Quarter: Juniors received the
kick at the northern end of the field, and
the Sophs were penalized five vards for
off side. On the second kick Crawford
returned fifteen yards. The Saphs tight-
ened up and forced the Juniors to punt.
Pair and Sparrow downed Shane in his
tracks. The Sophs were again unable
to make first down, so they punted, and
Perry returned eight vards.

Fourth Quarter: Porter started the
quarter with a forty-vard run, advancing
the ball to the Juniors’ ten-vard line, but
the referee had blown his whistle. so he
was called back. “The Juniors held tight
Then Alford
came near (o repeating Porter's perform-
ance, when he raced around the Sophs’
tight end for thirty yards. ‘Neisler then
tare through the line for ten more vards,
but the time was up,.and the game over.
