Coleridge classed Ben
. Jonson’s “The Ajchemist,”’
Sophocle’s- “Oedipus Rex’
and Fielding’s ‘‘Tom Jones”

as “the three most, perfect ~

plots ever planned.’’ In mo-
dern times this -perfection
of plot has been one of “The
Alchemist's"”” great assets in
performance. Such is the
case with Davidson's Drama
Department production, their
first of the season.

The oniy possible criticism

of the acting that I could_

register is the difficulty I,
as well as other members
of the audience at Wednes-
day night's performance, ex-
perienced in hearing during
the first few minutes of the
first scene. A mad, care-
fully choreographed, battle
takes place between Subtle,
Face and Dol in the open-
ing scene. The dialogue that
follows maintains the fren-
zied pace of the fight, to the

The play seems to have
been directed with an effort

If you don't see “The
Alchemist"’ this weekend,
you will be slighting your-
self, for it is a superb play
that is being very well per-
formed. My only regret is
that the powers that be did
not permit Jonson to stand
alone on his own merits, as
they did so successfully last
sbason with Shakespeare.
