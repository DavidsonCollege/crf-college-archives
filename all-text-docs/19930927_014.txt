Davidson ends Charlie's Invitational with win vs. Wake

By Will Cobb

The Davidson soccer team
started their six game stint versus
top 25 teams last Wednesday
against the 9th ranked Duke Blue
Devils. After 90 minutes of regu-
lation, the two teams found them-
selves tied at 1 a piece and headed
into overtime. Scenting a huge
upset, Davidson had its chances to
score but Duke grabbed the lead
and never let go with 5 minutes and
16 seconds left in the second over-
time on a beautiful cross to Jason

Field hockey
takes three
Straight games

By Nancy Hilles

Last week the Davidson field
hockey team went 3-0 as they de-
feated Catawba College, Appala-
chian State, and Louisville. The
Wildcats bounced back from their
loss to Wake Forest, playing three
strong games and bringing their
overall record to 6-3.

The Cats began their streak
last afternoon when they defeated
Catawba 3-0. Davidson dominated
from the whistle, out-hustling and
out-smarting the Catawba Indians
with quick, accurate passing. The
Cats defense was solid as usual,
and the team’s offensive pressure
was especially strong.

Senior co-captain Erin Lang
scored the first goal off a penalty
stroke, whisking the ball by the
Catawba goalie to the upper right
corner of the cage. The second
goal was scored by Andrea Short,
who was fresh off the injury list
and playing with her usual piz-

.zazz. The Wildcats kept up the
intensity throughout the game, with
Nicole Ficetoscoring the third goal
toward the end of the second half.
Overall, the victory was a success-
ful group effort; every player con-
tributed to the win.

The Cats got another notch in
the win column when they defeated
ASU 2-0on Friday. In the firsthalf
sophomore Holly Kledis got her
third goal of the season when she
pushed the ball right by the Appa-
lachian goal keeper. The Wildcats'
second goal was scored off a flaw-
less corner play when Nicole Ficeto
passed co-captain Suzanne
Hardesty the ball at the top of the
circle. Hardesty hit a perfectly
placed drive into the corner of the

As the Wildcats successfully
put pressure on the ASU goal cage,
Davidson’s defense completely
shut down Appalachian’s offen-
sive efforts. Senior Jill Bennett
played especially well as she
marked ASU’s top forward player,
denying her the ball at all times.
Junior Robin Pepper had a strong
defensive game, and goalies Emily
Coleman and Mary Ferguson were
both consistent, making key saves
when necessary. _

Davidson’s third game was

Kreis who headed the ball into the
corner of the net.

After a scoreless first half,
Duke took the lead early in the
second half after only 2 minutes
and 45 seconds of play when Brian
Kelly took’ a crossed ball and
headed it in for a 1-0 lead. The
score held until 4:16 left to play
when senior Andy Haile punched
in his second goal of the year.
About. two minutes before
Davidson’s goal brought the re-
turn appearance of goalie Alex

Deegan. Coach Slagle decided to
make this move to generate mo-
mentum and it worked, but
Deegan’s playing time was kept ,
short as Neal Andrews returned —
following the goal. Davidson’s
defense played excellently, sacri-
ficing every part of their bodies to
block the 26 shots Duke generated.
Though the loss was tough, the
Cats looked strong, playing toe to
toe with one of the nation’s most
respected programs from start to
finish. The Cats took this strong

performance into this past
weekend’s Verbatim Charlie’s In-
vitational tournament here at
Davidson.

- On Friday night, Davidson
matched up against Southern Con-
ference rival Furman. The 18th
ranked Paladins jumped on the
Wildcats quick, scoring lessthan 6
minutes into the game, and then
took a 2-0 lead five minutes later
when a rebounded ball was
pounded intothenet. But Davidson
answered early in the second half.

Charlotte's s

By Jason Byassee

Man, professional sports are
changing. It wasn’t long ago that
the Braves couldn’t beat anybody,
the Hornets’ stars were Kelly
Tripucka and Kurt Rambis, and
the closest thing we had to a pro-
fessional football team in the Caro-
linas was the Clemson Tigers.

But darnedif those days aren’t
gone. People with power in pro
sports have realized the shame in
leaving television markets un-
tapped and tickets unsold, and have
become dedicated to restructure
and expansion.

The resulting growth origi-
nally impacted Charlotte with the
arrival of the Hornets a few years
back, and that franchise’s success
has made owners itch to invest
anew in the Tarheel State.

Imagine a Charlotte with pro-
fessional franchises competing
year-round. The Hornets could
spend the winter making a run at
the NBA title, a major league base-
ball team couldentertain usinsum-
mer by competing with the Braves
in the new-and-improved National
League East, and the Carolina Pan-
thers could pass fall afternoons
cracking helmets with the likes of
the 49ers and the ‘Skins.

The idea isn’t all that far-
fetched. The crew that’s seeking to
bring the NFL to the Queen City

has assembled an impressive ros- .

ter of owners and financial plan-
ners, has sold enough ticket rights
in advance to pack their proposed
stadium, and has the Homets’ popu-
larity to point out as evidence of

area por

Jerry Richardson and his co-
owners have picked a cool name,
the team colors of black and blue,
and the great college stadium in
Death Valley at Clemson in which
to play their first few seasons.

More importantly, they have
the financial backing of area pow-
erhouses like Wachovia and
NationsBank on their side, a fact
the Richardsons had kept secret
until their presentation to the NFL
last week in Chicago.

Knock on wood with me here,
butit looks like the Panthers are on
their way to the gridiron. Soon the
real dreaming will begin, such as
trying to lure Joe Gibbs back to the
sideline from his NFL retirement
as our first head man.

And though it might take the
Panthers a heckuva lot longer to
Start winning than it took the Hor-
nets, itll be football. And that’ll be
enough.

Continuing our: look at the
future of Charlotte sports, the ‘93-
94 Hornets are a tough bunch to
analyze.

They lost a tough, accom-
plished athlete in the form of
Kendall Gill, one who was being
described as one of the “NBA’s
next great guards” only afew years
back.

Maybe an even greater prob-
lem is that fans will remember all
those wins last year (44), with the
expectation of greater things than
ever. Remember that the Hornets
beat a Boston Celtics team that
was without the late Reggie Lewis,

orts future grows

their captain and best player.
Enough pessimism though.
Hersey Hawkins, for all Charlotte
had to give up to get him (Gill and
then some) should bring more of-
fensive consistency toa unit that at
times forgot how toscore last year.
Andallthesellouts atthe Hive
again this year will continue to
inspire owner George Shinn to-
wards his next great project.
Shinn wants to bring a Major
League Baseball team to Charlotte.
And despite the addition of two
new teams already this year,
baseball’s owners are anxious to
add even more to the financial pay-
off that comes from expansion.
Look for a few years of Pan-
ther attendance success, coupled
with Shinn’s sales ability, to con-
vince baseball that it needs to visit
the Carolinas as well. Our little
metropolis will be a bonafide sports
town, believe it or not.
Now, I could conclude from
this analysis of Charlotte’s profes-
sional sports future that the local

‘economy will be enhanced (it cer-

tainly will), or that expansion will
contribute the city’s growth in over-
all size and national standing (most
likely), but I won’t.

Instead, Pll ask you tosit back,
sigh a sigh of contentment, and
think again of having real sports
year round.

Peanuts and cracker jacks on
summer afternoons, angry 300-
pound men hitting each other in
fall, and the Hive’s customary elec-
tricity in winter. Let’s get ready to
rumble.

Ian O’Brienscored his first goal of
the year when he took a pass from
freshman Fernando Campos and
finished perfectly. Unfortunately,
Davidson could get no closer as
Furman pulled away with 30 min-
utes left to capture a 3-1 lead that
would never change. Davidson’s
record dropped to (3-4, 1-1) on the
year while Furman moved to (6-0,
3-0), including a 5-2 victory over
South Carolina.

Rugby
competes
with Div. I

top teams

By Dack Stackhouse

The Davidson College Rugby
Football Club has had a tough
schedule in its first season as a
Division I rugby team. The first
two matches were against UNC-
Chapel Hill and Appalachian State
University, the number two and
number one ranked teams respec-
tively.

Davidson, fielding ateam with
many first year players, played
aggressively and on an equal level
with the Tarheels. Despite intense
play, the Wildcats still came up
short in the 24-10 loss. In the B
game at UNC, however, the Wild-
cats won 6-3,

Returning from a long road
trip, the team worked hard last
week in preparation for the match
with the top ranked ASU side.
Again, the Wildcats played very
well, but ASU won 30-8, a score
which does not reflect the game
itself. In the B game ASU won
again, 9-3.

Davidson has played better
than ever in its first two Division I
matches. With about 15-20 brand
new players, the team has a prom-
ising future. There has never been
so much raw talent on the team at
one time. With some practice and
experience, this team in the near
future may reclaim the state cham-
pionship status that it enjoyed in
the early 1980s.

Obviously it is a disadvantage
to play away from home, so the
team looks forward to hosting this
week the number three ranked
Guilford College. Scouting re-
ports indicate that ASU beat
Guilford with ease, so the Davidson
squad has an excellent chance to
win this match and perhaps earn a
top-five ranking in North Caro-
lina. :

The first ever home game as a
Division I team will be next Satur-
day, October 2, against Guilford
College. It will Be played on the -
IMAC fields at 1:00 p.m. The B
game will follow immediately,
probably ending around 4:30.
Please come out and support the
Davidson Rugby Club in their ef-
fort to break into the top five in
North Carolina. As always, the
team can use more players. Call
Edwin Thomas at x-6621.
