If You Don't Know,
You'd Better Ask Somebody

By Tina Smith

If this piece is pnnted it will
probably appear in the opinion,
section but it will be news to some
Yes, it’s finally ume for me to
write to the Davidsonian. It's my
senior year and I have sat and
watched issues rise and fall on the
pages of “The South’s Foremost
College Weekly.” Until now Thad
only donned the soapbox for my
lucky roommates and/or good
friends at the dinner table. But the
last issue of the Davidsonian
(October 28, 1991) enraged me so
much that I just couldn't help but
write in with my $1.50 --- that is
putin more than my “2 cents worth.”
It all started with the story on
Nikki Giovanni. Notonly was the
grammar poor but the structure
and content of the piece was less
than what I would expect from a
news editor. For those who may
not have known who Nikki Gio-
vanni is (and judging from
Davidson’s curriculum that
wouldn’t be unusual), the “article”
~~ and I use the term loosely --- was
notenlightening. Among the first
things I was told as a work study
student for Bill Giduz (News Di-
rector, College Relations) was that
every news story should have a
thorough account of who, what,
when, where and why. The Gio-
vanni piece had only her name and
current occupation as the who,
Thursday night as the when, anda

lot of misquoted statements from
her speech as the what. Perhaps,
the author of the article should
have read the story on Major Gen-
eral Buster C. Glosson for some
guidelines as to the proper form
and format for an informational
article on a prominent figure. Or
he could have found someone who
did know about Ms Giovanni and
had gone to the tlk to help him
with the article, because, in the
words of somebody's mama, “If
you don’t know, you'd better ask
somebody!” My deepest disap-
pointment, however, lies in the fact
that the editor of the newspaper
allowed such a poorly written story
to go to press.

Tt was almost by accident that
Tread the article “To Hell With It.”
The tle caught my eye because it
expressed my mood after reading
the articles on the electric jello
fliers and multiculturalism. I was
feeling “to hell with Davidson”
and wondering for the 50th time
why I didn’t go to State or Caro-
lina with the restofmy high school
class, or better yet to Howard, so I
could at least have a decent social
life. But that's a different story.

I was totally shocked by the
paragraph which read “Recently,
fans of the Adanta Braves were
chastised for their tendency to do
the Tomahawk Chop for hours on
end as their team defied the odds
on the playing field. That anyone

would find so benign a gesture
offensive to Native Americans is
ridiculous as far as I can tell.” The
author could have at least said “I
understand why Native Americans
are upset, but I don’t agree with
that reaction, because the Braves
fans mean no harm,” But instead,
he wrote the whole sentiment off
as “ridiculous”. If the Adanta
Braves were called the Adanta
Homeboys and fans dressed up in
Afro wigs and went around with
chicken bones shouting
“Yo! Yo! Yo!" youcan besi believe
I would be offended. Not based on
whether or not the fans meant me
any harm, but more because it is a
misrepresentation of black people.
As Nikki Giovanni said, “no people
should have to be a mascot.” If I
patted the back of someone with a
sunburn, the gesture is benign, but
it, still inflicts pain. So, if an
American Indian ‘says to me, “Tt
offends me to be called a ‘brave*
and for people to do tomahawk
gestures,” I would notbe so imma-
ture or insensitive as to call his
feelings “ridiculous.” One per-
son's benign is another person's
pain, and if you can’t understand
that person's pain, “you'd better
ask somebody!”

“multiplicity of cultures” on this
campus. But how much interac-
tion is spurred between these
groups? How much of that inter-
action makes us really consider
how we govern ourselves as we
relate? Mostof us have little basis
for relating closely with people
who fall outside ourcomfortzones,
and one of the most comfortless
zones is our collective perception
ofrace, particularly, between white
and black people.

Interestingly, multicultural-
ism, according to our understand-
ing, offers a novel response to the

idea of race and itsrole in our lives.
Tt says simply that race is a non-
factor in social relationships; cul-
tural similarities and differences
are what really bind and separate
us. We can debate the merits of
this argument for days, but suffice
it to say that it gives our organiza-
tion a model to channel honestand
thoughtful discussion.

I apologize if I was respon-
sible for the misconceptions of Mr.
Atchison and others. For us, mul-
ticulturalism is a tool, not a move-
ment. SERCH searches for com-
mon ground and understanding
between people who otherwise
might not have interacted. On that
level, I think SERCH is right on
target.

Sincerely,

We also never intended to
imply a familiarity with bisexual
forays into necrophilia with ani-
mals This was merely a satirical
way of showing the ridiculous na-
ture of some of Ms Blaise’s ar-
ticles. We apologize for inadver-
tently poking fun at any of Jessica
Reinertsen’s fetishes.

Finally, and most truthfully,
any “intelligent sexually active
female” will see our letter for what
it was: anattempttorile up the anal

Giovanni represents? “I suggest

I feel that since you are the editor

myopic morality on campus,

Yes, the law gives us the right
to call anyone a wop, kike, dike,
fag, nigger, skirt, bag, broad, or
chink. It also gives us the right to
draw posters of swastikas, women
in bondage, slaves being lynched,
Tape scenes, and other degrada-
tions of our fellow human beings.
T call on Davidson students to add
caring to mere law. I propose that
we all consider being responsible
for our ethics-to take the stand of
going further than the law and to
form a morality that respects and
cares for others.

Sincerely,

piece. Obviously, Mr Koonce
needs to learn to write his reviews
in such a way that the reader can
understand the contextand signifi-
cance of a speech. He uses the
word “moving” in his article but
the only thing we are moved to do
is throw away this piece of trash.
We will attempt to address
some of the discrepancies in his
article:
~~ Ms Giovanni said that if society
feels that changes should be made
it is not our place to ask, “Why
now? Why wasn’t this brought up
earlier?” These questions are not
important, society should just make
the appropriate changes. She went
on to comment about racism and
this issue of change. Her correct
quote should be, “It's foolish that
in 1991 we have so much racism.”
Regarding the issue of white
America, she said, “No one wants
to be named by white America
anymore.” She expressed frustra-
tion regarding how white America
feels that it has the right to name
everything, no matter who they
hurt, degrade or humiliate in the
process.
--Contrary to Mr Koonce’ belief,
Ms Giovanni is not an advocate of

a Senior Citizens NASA program.
Her basic reason for mentioning
space was to stress the point of
how our society expects to live
with others on another planet, yet
we cannot live with each other on
this planet. (Unfortunately, the
reader is never able to grasp this
concept because it is haphazardly
placed at the end of two nonsense /
paragraphs.)

--The idea that aliens should land
in the black community because
“we're indifferent” must be ad-
dressed in context. Ms Giovanni
was merely saying that the black
community is such a multicultural
entity that we would be less biased
and more accepting than other cul-
tures.

Before we are taken out of
context, this article is not meant to
spark any controversy. Our only
intention is to clarify the injustice
given to our black poet laureate,
Ms Nikki Giovanni. But the ques-
tion still remains whether Mr
Koonce really understands Ms
Giovanni's concept of people, one
dealing with coherence and unity.
However, if these themes cannot
be found within elementary para-
graphs, how can we expect any-
thing more? No wonder he didn’t
get it right.

actually accompanies the song they
performed, many spectators
thought the young men were reen-
acting a gang rape or a sick sexual
fantasy for the “enjoyment” of the
viewing audience. Asmembersof
Phi Delt, we believe thateveryone
inattendance deserves an apology,
for we in no way wish to promote
gang rape and find no humor with
anyone who does. Although per-
sonally we wereunable to attend
Air Band this year, we can think of
nO situation where such actions
would be acceptable. Davidson's
campus is a microcosm of the
society in which we are expected
to participate asa intelligentadults,
and ifsuch acts are glorified on the
national scale the way they were
that night, we all struggle with the
curse of living inone of the world’s
most barbaric and perverted coun-
tries.

This letter is not simply writ-
tentoaselect group of women who
disagreed with theactions of one
particular act, It is aimed at those

_ people who have faced the horrors

Tis

of rape and had to deal with its
ramifications. It also speaks to a
dying breed of people who have
good morals anda sense of the idea
of what “clean fun” is all about.
Granted it is often more difficult
for a man to sympathize with a
female victim of rape than it is for
a woman, but men should imagine
how they would feel if they were
informed that their mother or sister
had been gang raped or sexually
abused. Although we are sure that
the participants did not intend for
theactto be seen in the fashion that
ithas been perceived, we can only
apologize for ourselves as mem-
bers of Phi Delt and insure con-
cerned students that such actions
will not be allowed as long as we
remain members. The purpose of
AirBandisnotto offend people by
glorifying society's most vicious
crimes, but unfortunately such as
thecase in this year’s competition.

From the accounts that we have
heard, the performance was not

“well accepted by the audience

which does indeed give usa good
deal of respect for those onlookers
who refused to support such a
ludicrous act.
