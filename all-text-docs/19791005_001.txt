Two Davidson students, one alumnus arrested at Barnwell protest

By JOHN BOSWELL
Staff Writer

Two Davidson students and a recent
graduate were arrested Monday for
trespassing at a nuclear power installa-
tion in Barnwell County, South Caro-
lina.

The students were taking part in a
series of anti-nuclear’ demonstrations
last weekend. Barnwell County is the
site of three nuclear power installations:
Allied-General Nuclear Services (AGNS)
reprocessing plant, Chem-Nuclear Sys-
tems low-level radioactive waste burial
ground, and the federal government’s
Savannah River plant.

Junior Geoff Little, freshman Brian
McMaster, and Brian Jacobs’79 were all
arrested at-the AGNS plant site. More

than 150 other protestors were arrested

Tenure topic

awaits Trustees

The tenure decisions of last

on Monday at all three sites.

Little and Jacobs spent two nights in
the Barnwell jail before being released
early Wednesday morning. McMaster
was taken to the Walterboro jail,
approximately fifty miles away. He was
released about noon Wednesday. About
sixty of those arrested were still in jail
Wednesday.

Six other Davidson atuitatite protested
at Barnwell but were not arrested.

Most protestors who were arrested,
including Little, Jacobs, and McMaster,
elected to stay in jail rather than pay bail
because. of a disagreement with the
South Carolina Attorney General's off-
ice. Those arrested expected bond to be
minimal as the result of a supposed
agreement between protest group law-
yers and law enforcement officials.

“They supposedly had a deal with the
courts that it would be $10,’’ said
sophomore Susan Marynowski, one of
the protestors. Speaking over the phone

- from Barnwell, Little said the lawyers

had not really arranged an agreement,

but that a $10 or $15 bond had been .

expected. The protestors had planned to
stay in jail if the bond exceeded $15,
Little said. The bond was $25.

A spokesman for the Attorney Gen-
eral’s office in Columbia, South Caro-
lina, said there was no agreement with
the protestor’s lawyers because no such
agreement could legally be made. “Set-
ting bond is the prerogative of the
magistrate,” said the spokesman. He
said the Attorney General’s office would
not have objected to a $10. bond;
however, they would not have a,

to a $100 bond either.

Fifteen dollars was the bond set for
those arrested in a similar protest last
year in Barnwell. According to the
Attorney General’s office, $25 is the
average bail for trespassing.

Sponsored by the Southeastern Na-
tural Guard, the weekend of protests
included an alternative energy fair on
Saturday, a protest march Sunday along-
Highway 64 to the three nuclear installa-

‘ tions, and mass civil disobedience Mon-

day at the three sites.

The demonstrations were carefully
planned out and arranged, according to
Marynowski. “Affinity groups” led the
protests. Such groups had beeli trained
in how to run non-violent protests and in
how to act when arrested. Other groups

Cartmill plans new athletic complex

By TIM WHALEN

Staff Correspondent
Athletic Director Thomas Cartmill is now drawing up tentative
plans for a new athletic complex to relieve overcrowding in

‘ May will be a major topic of
discussion when the Board of
Trustees meets Thursday and
Friday, according to Senior
Cathy Ansheles.

Sociology Professor Norm
Koller, Political Science Pro-
fessor Joseph Retzer, and Eng-
lish Professor Georgianna Zieg-
ler were all denied tenure last
spring by the Trustees. The
decisions made on the Adminis-
tration’s recommendation met
with displeasure among stu-
dents and faculty.

Thursday morning, Anshe-
les, Senior Tommy Thompson
and Junior Eric Christensen
along with a group of professors
will meet with several trustees
to discuss the tenure decisions.
The professors are Religion
Professor David Kaylor, Philos-
ophy Professor Earl MacCor-
mac, and Philosophy Professor
Robert Maydole. The group has
been allotted a half-hour for the
meeting. According to May-
dole, the professors were re-
quested to accompany the stu-

- dents because the students
lacked official channels to meet
with the Trustees. Also, May-

Decision faces one more vote

Student Conduct Council votes in new honor pledge

By MEBANE ATWOOD

The Student Conduct Council
(SCC) voted unanimously last
Tuesday to require students to
write outa: new form of the

classwork, to Dean of
Students Will Terry. (Exam
envelopes ‘already include a

copy of the pledge).

The new honor pledge reads:
“I pledge that I have neither
given nor received help on this
(review, paper, etc.), nor have I

observed any violation on the
part of others.”’

According to Terry, the SCC :

will vote again on the proposal
in October so the members will
have two weeks to re-examine
their decision. The Proposal

Since the vote was unani-
mous, the chance of the pro-
posal's being rejected are very
slim, Terry said.

Terry ‘made the tila at

the SCC meeting Tuesday. Ori-

ginally, the proposal was devel- -

oped and recommended to Terry
on September 16 during the
Judicial Retreat; a meeting of
faculty and students involved
with Honor Code policy.

Johnston Gym and the football parking lots.

The complex would include a new intramural gym, more parking
spaces, and more outdoor athletic fields.

Cartmill said he will present his plans this weekend to the
Trustees. Development Director Duane Dittman said he does not
expect final approval of the plans before May, if at all. ;

According to Cartmill, the gym would probably stand where the
football practice field is now, and the parking lots would be added

near the football stadium.

Cartmill said the new complex is needed largely because the
number of students has increased while facilities have not been

expanded. '

ihe new athletic fields are
planned merely to replace those
over which the new gym would
be built.

Cartmill feels the new facili-
ties will make the College more
attractive to prospective stu-
dents interested in recreational
athletics.

Dittman said the cost of the
complex could not be estimated

~ because it is still in the very

early stages of planning, but he
guesses a price of several mil-
lion dollars. He added that all
money for the project will come

from alumni and friends of the .

College. Cartmill said that there
are “‘no plans to take anything
out of the operational budget.”

The idea of such a complex
was approved in 1976 by the
Trustees as part of the David-
son 1987 program. Cartmill said
his proposal describes what
would ideally be includéd in the
complex. He said he expects the
Trustees to scale down these
plans in light | of financial consi-
derations.

The new gym would ideally
contain three basketball courts,
six raquetball courts, two
squash courts, six.indoor tennis
courts, anindoor track, and
NGAA regulation swimming
and diving pools and might
have a sliding roof, Cartmill

An architect should be selec-
ted within three months, Ditt-
man said. No administrators
contacted would estimate when

construction might begin.

Erwin starts

magazine

One-time editor of The David-
sonian Charles Erwin is now

.making plans-to publish a

magazine of ‘‘short stories,
poetry, and satire.”

The magazine, called The
Albatross, will appear monthly
beginning October 16, accord-
ing to Managing Editor Ted
Jones. Erwin will be Editor-in
chief and Publisher.

Jones said The Albatross was
designed as a “creative writing
outlet’’ for its four member
staff, and the student body as a
whole.

“We didn’t plan The Alba-
tross as an attempt to compete
with Hobart’s Park. This is just
something we wanted to do,”
