Workmen Begin
On Erwin Lodge

By Lonnie Tufther

I have heard a great deal about
Edwin Lodge and about the general
vicinity in which it>was going to be
built but I wanted to know more
about it as other students do. So
I went over to the library and found
Mrs. Erwin and asked her -if she
would mind telling me a little more
about it. She began by saying that
plans were coming right along but
that the construction had been stop
ped by an inability to obtain good
umber. She was so enthusiastic
that I couldn't help feeling the same
way. |
IT asked exactly where the iorikege
was to be located and she replied
that it would be just off the golf
course near the fifth hole. There
is a road which turns off Concord
Road leading almast—to—the—lodge
and the remainder of the distance
will be covered by a road flanked
by Oak trees which will be planted
each year.

The location has an_ interesting
history. Abaqut fifteen years ago it
was an old muddy hill traversed by
