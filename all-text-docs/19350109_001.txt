FOUR DAVIDSON
PROFESSORS ON
RADIO PROGRAM

Dr. Vowles and Prof. Pfohl Pre-
sent First Holiday Broadcast

PRES. WILSON HONORED

Dr. W. L. Lingle And Dr. J. M.
McConnell Speak On Second

The Student Body following its fes-
tive inclinations for the holidays, mem-
bers of the faculty went before the mi-
crophone December 21 and 28 to present
the regular Friday evening
College radio program.

Davidson

Dr. G. R. Vowles, professor of Ger-
man, and Professor J. C. Pfohl, of the
,,music department, combined to present
. pre-Christmas program, and the next

Week, Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of

the college, and Dr. J. M. McConnell,
of the department of History, divided
thirty minutes between them, speaking
on Woodrow Wilson.

“The first record we have of the ob-
servation of Christmas,” Dr. Vowles told
his radio audience, “comes two centuries
after the birth and that tells of the
byrning of a building of Christmas wor-
ship by Diocletian.” In spite of this
inauspicious beginning Christmas has
come to be perhaps the most widely
celebrated holiday in the Western world.

Very little is certain about the date of
the first Christmas, pointed out Vowles.
At first it was celebrated in the spring
but in 350 A.D. the present time of the
year was adopted. The leaders of the
Church wished to supplant the pagan
festivals by Christian observances and
the present time of Christmas coincides
with the lengthy pagan celebration of
the winter solstice.

Other pagan contributions to our
Christmas clebration are the holly, mis-
tletoe and .the Christmas tree. Even
after heathen festivals had been dis-
placed, remarked Vowles, abuses and ex-
cesses still clung to the Christmas cele-
bration so that in 1644 English Puritans
forbade any merrimént whatever.

Vowles then told of the development
of Christmas-carols, and the rest of the
program consisted of a dozen selected
Carols played on the organ by J. C.
Pfohl, with introductory sketches by
Vowles. Another musical highlight of
the same program was Pfohl’s cornet
solo, “Nazareth,” by Gounod.

On the next program, Dr. W. Tf.
Lingle chose as his topic, “Woodrow
Wilson at Davidson” and gave several
interesting sidelights his life
Davidson.

In answer to the question, “Was He
Expelled from Davidson?” he stated in
the negative and pointed out that his rec-
ord for deportment was 100, His grades
were excellent with the exception of
mathematics.

FRESHMEN HOLD
ANNUAL SMOKER

Prof. Williams, Skip Brown And
Bob Smith Address First
Year Men

The Freshman class of ’38 had their
spiritual sendoff for the Christmas holi-
days by a smoker which was held in the
Chambers building banquet hall on De-
cember 17, 1934, at 10 P.M.

The principal speakers for the occasion
were Bob Smith, Skip Brown, and Prof.
Williams. The talks were mainly
Christmas messages and very short.
While the boys were getting together in
individual bull sssions, Bronston Kenney
gave a few selections on the accordion
which were enjoyed by all. Punch,
cakes, cigars and cigarettes were served
during the evening and were served by

“several volunteering freshmen.

There were approximately sixty at-
tendants at the function. After the meet-
ing was over the boys gathered together
outside of Chambers and gave a yell for
the class of ’38.

These smokers are annual events of
each freshman class and are to bring
each boy in closer contact with his fel-
low classmen. It brings a unity to the
class as a whole and makes each boy
seem more friendly to the other. The
smoker was such a big success that an-
other is being planned as soon as pos-
sible.

The Modern Language Association,
meeting during the Christmas holidays,

French Department.

The Association met in Philadelphia,
December 27-29, at the invitation of
Swarthmore College. According to Dr.

Cumming the meeting was unusually well

attended this year.

The general opinion of the delegates
was that the teaching profession seems
to have rounded the corner and is steadily
improving. They that

Pan-Hellenic Council Offers
Kay Kyser For Mid-Winters

In an effort to bring a truly outstand-
ing orchestra to Davidson the Pan-Hel-
lenic Council has contracted with Kay
Kyser and his nationally known band to
play for the Mid-winter dance set, the
gala event of the Davidson social calen-
dar.

Kay Kyser has a band already well
known to Davidson students. At present
he is located at the famous Blackhawk
Restaurant in Chicago, but next month
he is going to make a southern tour for
the purpose of playing at several college
dances. He has engagements to play at
eight southern schools, including the Uni-
versity of ‘Tennessee, Sewanee, Alabama,
Auburn, Georgia Tech, North Carolina,
Washington and Lee, and Davidson. At
present he broadcasts nightly over WGN
and associated broacasting stations.

The date for the set of dances has
been set for Friday and Saturday, Feb-
ruary 15 and 16. The usual procedure
will be followed, with a formal dance
on Friday night, a tea dance on Saturday
afternoon, and an informal dance on
Saturday night. All three dances will
take place in the Charlotte Armory.
Plans are being made for some type of

figure for one of the dances. A price

for the dances has not been set.

Since Kay Kyser himself is a North
Carolinian from Rocky Mount, and since
eight members of his orcbestra are also
from this state, the band is in great de-
mand among the colleges of the state.
It is possible that a conflict in dates will
arise between Davidson and two other
schools. In case of such a conflict,
Davidson would have the prior claim,
having signed their contract before either
of the others.

In the event that Kay Kyser fails to
fulfill his part of the contract,.the Pan-
Hellenic Council assures the student
body that another orchestra of equal rank
and fame will be secured. The Council
issued this statement in order to clear
up rumors and to forewarn the students
concerning the orchestra set-up for mid-
winters.

“We want the student body to realize
that the council is not trying to make any
money out of these dances,” said Mims
Rogers, president of the Pan-Hellenic
Council. “We believe that the students
are willing to support big time dancing,
and we are making an effort to bring it
to them. This is their chance to show
whether they want it or not.”

THREE CHARGES BROUGHT

Rumors of a Military Court-Martial
on the campus were fully contirmed late
today by a report from Headquarters of
the Offi-
cers Training Corps.

Davidson Battalion, Reserve

With the reports came a copy of the
charges and an extract of a special or-
der from Atlanta authorizing the trial.
The name of the accused, a second lieu-
tenant of ID company, has not yet been
made public.

\lthough a court-martial has been in
the offing since early December when a
pistol was stolen from ‘the armory, offi-
cials have kept their actions shrouded in
secrecy, and it was not until this after-
noon that the details were made public.

Members of the prosecution, having
done a good job of sleuthing, have
brought three charges against the ac-
cused lieutenant. They are as follows:
Charge [T: Violation of the Ninety-
