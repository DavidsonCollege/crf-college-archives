Sophs 47; Juniors 24.

The Sophomores became the class
basketball champions Saturday aft-
ernoon by defeating the Junior
team ~ .o 24 in the last game of the
series. This victory gives the
Sophomore team a perfect record.
The game was fast and free from
fouls. Both teams were handicip-
ped by the absence of one reguiar,
and their places were filled by sub-
stitutes. From the beginning the
Sophomores led and at no stage of
the game were they in danger of
being overtaken in scoring.

For the Sophomores, Streibich
and Roberts were the chief point
gatherers, while Brice and Oltman
played stellar ball for the Juniors.

Juniors 38; Seniors 28.

In one of the hardest fought
games this year the Juniors defeat-
ed their old rivals, the Seniors, to
the tune of 38 to 28. The game was
fast and interesting throughout.
After a few minutes of play the Ju-
niors tossed in the first basket and
soon led their opponents by what
seemed to be a safe margin, but the
Seniors overtook them by showing
marvelous teamwork and pretty
shooting. The half ended with the
juniors leading by one field goal.

n the second half the Juniors came
back strong and outclassed the Se-
niors in every department of the
game. Their team work was excel-
lent in this period. Brice and Olt-
man were the Juniors’ best bets,
while Hawkins and Askew were the
mainstays of the Seniors.

Davidson wound up its 1919 foot-
ball season last Thursday by trim-
ming Furman 41 to 14 in the’
Thanksgiving game. The game
ended a season which could hardly
be called successful from a stand-
point of games won, and yet with a,
couple exceptions a season’s result
satisfactory to Davidson supporters.

ith two or three exceptions, all
the teams played are rated in higher
football circles than college football
and against these teams the Wild-
cats have shown their best work.

Opening the season with a rush,
the Red and Black machine trounc-
ed Guilford and Wake Forest. The
next two games were dropped to
Clemson and Washington and Lee
by 7 to 0 scores. As an outcome of
these two games, the Wildcats lost
the services of Jack Black, who suf-
fered a broken hand. LaFar de-
veloped a bad leg and Johnny John-
son sprained an ankle. Coming back
strong, however, with a line-up con-
spicuous with subs, University of S. .
C. was beaten on a muddy field by
one touchdown. The Wildcats then
lost to the flying Cadets from V. M.
I. 14 to 7, Tech administered a 33 to
0 defeat and N. C. State triumphed
over the Presbyterians 36 to 6. Fac-
ing Carolina in the championship
game, with Jack Black still on the
side-lines, the plucky Wildcats held
the White and Blue to 10 to 0, The
disappointment of the season came
on November 22, when the Red and
Black were held to a scoreless tie
by Presbyterian College of S.C. To
offset this, however, Davidson took
Furman in camp Thanksgiving and ,
administered a good drubbing to the
tune of 41 to 14. A summary of the
scores follows:

Davidson___.- 33 Guilford -... 0
Davidson... 21 Wake Forest 0

Davidson... 0 P.C. .-W-... 0,
Davidson____- 41 Furman -_-.. 14

_ The result in games won and lost
is: Won 4, lost 6, tied 1. Only 115
points were scored against 121 for,
her opponents. The Wildcats scor-:
ed 17 touchdowns and were humili-
ated themselves only 16 times.
Thirteen goals of the 17 tries were
successful. No field goals were at-
tempted, while opponents scored
two by this method.

_The team ‘will be well shot to
pieces for next year by the loss of
several old D. C. stars. Jack Black
will never be seen in action in Red
and Black football classics. Never
before in its history has a man
brought Davidson more“honor in
the athletic world than this grid-
iron warrior. Henry Spann will also
be lost and the big .question is,

pene will pilot the Wildcats now?”

football seasons in its history, and

GOOD.

Greenwood, S C., Nov. 27, ’19.
To Davidson’s :Grand Football

Team:

Accept by warmest congratula-
tions jor this glorious victory over
Furman. It is wonderful, and loyal
alumni all over the ‘country are
proud, beamingly proud of you.
I wouldn't take a hundred dollars
for that score of 42-14. I knew you
could do it; I was looking for it. I
knew the grand old Davidson fight-
ing spirit that has no equal could
not always stay down. That
Scotch-Irish Presbyterian determi-
nation, confidence and superiority
could not but exert itself. That is
the pep, the fight, and the spirit that
has always made Davidson famous,
and that makes us all proud of our
alma mater.

We forgive you now for merely
tying P. C. and for not beating some
oi the other teams. You have
climaxed the season; you have done
what others couldn't; you have
trounced—trounced. You have run
over, around, and through, tram-
pled upon, subdued and buried all

7| the pride, spirit, and aspiring hopes

of Furman, her alumni and friends
for miles around.

I am prouder of your achieve-
ment today than of any former vic-
tory a Davidson team ever won.

" Here’s to you, to the college, and
to the Davidson spirit that always
wins and can never die.
Cordially and always yours,
F. L. B., ’07.

BAND HAS PLEASANT TRIP
TO ROCK HILL.

Davidson's R. O. T. C. Band had a
most delightful trip to Rock Hill, S.
C. last week, to assist in their Com-
munity Thanksgiving Service.

The Band arrived in Rock Hill at
6 p.m., on Wednesday, the 16th, and
were entertained while in the homes of
the good people of that place. Mr. W.
J. Roddey, Jr., was in charge of their
entertainment,

On Thursday at 10 am, the Band,
|directed by Mr. Robert Mell, lead the
lsinging for the services. There were
‘over 3,000 people present. ;
| At 3:30 that afternoon the Band,
gave a concert on the campus of Win-
| throp College. The girls greatly as-
sisted the Band by their singing in the
choruses of several numbers, and there
were miles and miles of “smiles.” After
the concert the fellows enjoyed the
time—until 6— socially.

At 7:30 p.m. another concert was
igiven at one of the Community Houses
in one of the mill districts, under the
direction of Mr. Mell’s “Y“ work.

In returning, the Band. left Rock
Hill at 11:35 a.m. Friday.

| James Watson Says, “I'll Never For-
get When Father's Hogs Got
Cholera.

“One morning he found 20 hogs dead
and several sick. He called in the Vet.
who after dissecting a rat caught on the
premises, decided that the rodents had
conveyed the germs. Since then I am
never without RAT-SNAP. It’s the
surest, quickest rat destroyer I know.”
