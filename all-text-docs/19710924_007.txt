employ the veer offense.

William and Mary has re-
cently adopted the veer, and
has made good use of the new
style thus far in their season.

Kill Cat Attack

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

If a prize were given for the
most snake-bitten football team
in America, the Davidson Wild-
cats would win easily.

After suffering a disastrous
combination of fumbles, inter-
ceptions, leaky defense and
genuine bad breaks last season,
coaches and players alike were
confident that things had to
improve.

Against Wake Forest the un-
derdog ’Cats fought admirably
and showed signs that perhaps
the tables would turn for them
soon.

The VMI game was probably
looked upon by many fans as
a breather on the schedule.

The usually hapless Keydets
presented somewhat of an un-
known quantity before Satur-
day’s contest, and new Coach
Bob Thalman’s charges were
at least nine-point underdogs to
the ’Cats.

What took place in Lexing-
ton would make a_ good item
for Ripley’s. The Wildcat of-
fense, spearheaded by quarter-
backs Scotty Shipp and Rick
Kemmerlin and runner Johnny
Ribet, amassed 403 total yards.
However, it forgot to do one
thing: score touchdowns.

Harold Wilkerson’s thirty-
yard field goal seemed small
compared ot the 27 points scor-
ed by the Keydets.

Moving the football was no
problem for the offense, as it
mounted four drives of over
sixty yards. The old nemeses,
two interceptions and four fum- -
bles, thwarted these scoring op-
portunities.

On one occasion, Ribet smash-
ed his way down near the goal
line and apparently thrust the
ball across for a score. Officials
ruled differently, however, and
on a subsequent play Shipp
fumbled on the Keydet one-
yard line.

The ’Cats defense relaxed on
only a few plays, but these
proved to be costly. A seventy-
six yard gallop by Keydet back
Mac Bowman put the ’Cats in
a hole 14-3, and they could not
recover.

Several young players turned
in outstanding games on of-
fense for the ’Cats. Junior end
Andy Davis caught five passes
and seemed to have recovered
from his leg injury. Sophomores
Mike Harding and Dave Ingold
also snagged several passes.

The Wildcats at this stage of
the schedule have proven that
the defense can perform bril-
liantly and that the offense can
produce awesome statistics.
However, the right mixture of

each in the same game is need-
ed.

Against such a formidable foe
as Wake-Forest, the ‘Cats look-
ed like world beaters. Against
a greatly improved, but not ex-
actly terrifying VMI team, bad
luck and mistakes led to their
downfall.

Carolina.

They defeated both teams by
large margins on the road and
return to Williamsburg _ this
week for their first home game
against the Wildcats.

The Indian’s veer will not be
as new to Davidson as it was
lo the other Southern Confer-
ence teams, for they faced one
of the best executed veers at
Wake Forest.

The Davidson defense held
its own for over three quarters,
maintaining a Wildcat lead, but
finally succumbed late in the
game to a torrent of Deacon
scoring.

“We have improved,” David-
son head coach Dave Fagg says,
“and we are working on over-
coming the mistakes that have
cost us past games.”

The Indians will be one of
the toughest opponents the ‘Cats

will face. Last year they barely
eked out a fourth quarter vic-
tory over Davidson, but they
began the year with almost the
same team returning, including
the entire backfield.

Todd Bushnell, the Indians
second leading rusher for last
year, broke his collar bone in
their match with The Citadel,
and is out for the season.

But the key to the William
and Mary offense is their run-
ning back Phil Mosser.

Mosser racked up 1286 yards
rushing last year and
pected to repeat or improve
that figure this year. He scored
over 50 points last season.

The greatest advantage the
Wildcats will have is in atti-
tude.

William and Mary considers
the tough pait of their season
to be over after their first two

is ex-

wins, while Davidson thinks of
the season as just beginning.

Harriers fo Open
At Stone Mountain

The Davidson’ cross-country

team travels to Atlanta tomor-

row to open its season against
what coach Sterling Martin
terms ‘‘an outstanding field.”

Twelve Wildcat runners: will
compete with over two hundred
other runners for fifteen individ-
ual trophies and a team trophy
in the Stone Mountain Road
Race.

Three of Martin’s runners
have competed at Stone Moun-
tain before. Last year, team
captain Howard Boyd placed
27th, Joe Shibley got 48th place,
and Richard Fort took 57th.
