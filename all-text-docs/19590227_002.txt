Better Planning For Last Two Years

Dr. John Bevan has been granted
a rare privilege among educators: to
help. build a new college from the
ground up. His ideas concerning cur-
riculum and educational policy are,
to say the least, exciting.

They. are based on a recent per-
sonal survey of several outstanding
small liberal arts colleges, plus sev-
eral years of personal teaching ex-
perience. The result is a set of plans
for the new Florida Presbyterian Col-
lege that seems almost too good to
be true, and certainly will appear
Utopian to many.

Nevertheless, the policies they
contain have ‘proved to be feasible in
practice and highly satisfying in the
way they contribute to the realization
of iiberal education in its ideal form.
And not only are such “Utopian’’ poli-
cies important in planning’a new col-

lege. They may also be used to ad-
vantage in re-examining an institu-
tion whose concept of iliderai: educa-
tion has of late gone stale: namely,
Davidson.

Previous remarks on Davidson's
educational plan made in this: column
have mainly been ‘concerned with ap-
parently more “basic” aspects of the
educational program, principally the
required courses of the first two
years.

At least of equal importance, how-
ever, are the student’s last two years,
consisting of the major and minor
program. plus whatever electives he
may choose to take. Here, of course,
some departments are better off than
others, with - well-developed major
programs in some subjects, and quite
rudimentary ones in others.

As a general rule, it is safe to
say that Davidson is failing to take
advantage of the cumulative effect of
the courses her students:take during
their first two years. For example,
students often find advanced courses

little different in method, aim, or
purpose from freshman or _ intro-
ductory courses in the same subject.
In a university this situation does not
usually arise, since advanced courses
at a high school level for both grad-
uates and undergraduates are avail-
able, but small colleges must guard
against making the last two years a
mere repetition of the first two.

The key to the last two years is

the major program, and with regard |

to it there are two main problems:
inadequate course offerings in cer-

tain departments, and a general fail-

ure to take advantage of the ability,
interest, and previous training of
Students majoriiig in a subject. The
only remedy for the first is to hire
more professors to bolster up under-
staffed departments, and to replace

incompetent teachers whenever pos- |
sible (this, of course, is very diffi- |

cult to do).,

For the second aspect of the: prob-
lem, some changes can be made
which, at least for a good percentage
of the. student body, are both prac-
tical in the long run and feasible: in
the near future. Certain features of
the planned curriculum of the new
Florida Presbyterian College could
profitably be duplicated or even ex-
tended at Davidson: comprehensive

examinations in a student's major and |

minor fields, enlarged honors pro-
gram and seminar courses in all de-
partments, and the requirement of a
senior thesis in the student’s major.
Administrative difficulties would
be many, and the inertia that is part
of the Davidson atmosphere would

Freshman Class Satisfied With
Most Aspects Of Campus Routine

up, to the label.of “one of the twenty-

thinking about changing things a. lit-

What Do They Know --
Your Name Or Their Jobs?

During the next week the Student
Body is to be faced with its annual
duty of selecting a man to serve in
the office of Student Body President.

Three men, Dee Green, Bobby Liv-
ingston, and John Huie will present
their cases to the Student Body at
Chapel on Tuesday. Students will do
well to listen and judge with care
as they choose between the three
men.

Next year will find the Student
Council in an entirely new situation
as the Honor Court is organized and
becomes the campus’s judicial body.
Without forceful and dynamic lead-
ership the Student Council will be in
danger of becoming a high class de-
bating club, and its President could
become Davidson’s chief figurehead.

A man who feature’s a good smile
and a name catching memory, but
little real leadership ability could
very well bury the Council with a
year of presidential inertia. In past
years too many Council Presidents
have been the last men on campus
willing to do original thinking about
student problems. Such men were

able to slip by on the strength of the )

proved these tests accurate.
Their high school records
proved them well qualified for
leadership on the college level
and. their record has again

| spoken well for them.

But they were exceptional in
another way; for just a few
weeks after they entered Da-
vidson, they showed a dislike
for certain “established” tradi-
tions by overtly rebelling
against the Court of Control.

The: DAVIDSONIAN thought
it would be interesting to find
out how these same freshmen
feel about -some of the insti-
tutions and custotns that have
constituted. their environment

|‘ for the past semester.

- Pat Rush, speaking of the

| sehool in general, said, “I am

Council’s reputation, but this will not |

be the case in the years to come as
thinking students ask the old ques-
tion, “Just what is the Student Coun-
cil doing?” with new meaning.

Current President John Kuyken-
dall can not be put in this category.
He has proved himself to be a leader
willing to consider any solution to
problems of the College and its stu-
dents. Though success has not al-
ways been as full as the DAVIDSON-
IAN might have hoped for, President
John has been more than willing to
try, a statement which cannot be
made for many of his predecessors.

The DAVIDSONIAN hopes. all

three candidates will make as clear.

as possible in their @ampaign speech-
es just where they stand on the press-
ing campus issues. We especially
hope that they will express an opin-
ion as to the future role of the Coun-
cil as it ceases to be a judicial body
and turns its efforts to the legislative
field.

In short, we're not half as interest-
ed in whether the candidates know
our names as we are in what they
know about the Council.

well satisfied with my choice
of Davidson. Compared to some
other schools which my friends

| attend it may fall short in some

ways, but overall the good
points far overshadow the bad
ones.” Pat continued, “I favor
very much the liberal arts pro-
gram. It is most important to
have a basic knowledge of all
things rather than a, specialized

class entered. Davidson

one.”

When asked about the value
of chapel, Bill Moss disagreed
with school policy, saying, “It's
pretty useless except for an-
nouncements and student busi-
ness. If the speakers were good
enough chapel wouldn't have to
be compulsory, That would be
better. Making chapel compul-
sory. is to admit that it has lit-
tle appeal to the individual stu-
dent.”

Ran Shaffner, looking up
from a desk piled high with
books, disagreed. by saying, “I
think chanel is worth while and
that the speakers are good; and
it’s not such a. long period that
it will hurt anybody.”

' CLASS LECTURES

Bob McFarland, taking time
out from the post-semester task
of cleaning out his desk drawer,
commented on the class lee-
tures he was receiving. “Some
lectures seem to be really well
prepared. In others the profes-
sor seems to be relying on past
knowledge entirely, not on a
prepared lesson for the hour.”

Interrupted while typing a
story for the DAVIDSONIAN,
feature writer Bob Bradford
paused to give his views on the
courses required. of freshmen.
“I don’t think much of them at
all,” he said. “I think the new
Bible program is a great im-
provement. While I don’t like
required ROTC at all, I think
some math is necessary.”

INTEREST SHOULD SHIFT

One of the most pertinent
questions that will face the new
Student Council will be that of
, expanding its field of interest
and functions to replace those
that will be absorbed by the
Honor Court. The answer to
this question may be divided
into two parts: 1) a more
thorough examination and ex-
ploitation of ideas that, for lack
of time, past Student Councils
have been forced to skip over
lightly with little or no
thought; and 2) the expansion
into entirely different fields in
addition to those already hand-
led by the Council.

TIME ON HANDS
No one will deny that the ab-

the problem of how and into
what the Council will expand.

The present Council, with fi-
nal run-offs less than a week
off, is evidently having trouble
seeing itself in this jive.
At their meeting Monday night
(see article on page one) the
question of World University
Service, a new. challenge in the
Davidson circle of participa-
tion, was treated entirely in the
light of the old Council sys-
tem. Obviously for such a pro-
ject to get off the ground, it

ty interesting,” said Mark Hud-
son. “It is hard to study here,
but I usually study in the li-
brary. The hall prayer meet-
ings and having close friends
in the dorms made the adjust-
ment to college life a lot
easier.”

Jimmy Giles and Bill Patter-
son were listening to records,
but took time out to comment
on the DAVIDSONIAN. “We
really like for the DAVIDSON.
IAN to take a stand on issues,”
they agreed. “We think it
should represent the student
body and its opinion, and when
it does, it impresses us. Also,”
they added, “we would like to
see more comment on. events
outside of Davidson, both. do-
mestie and international, in re-
local. situation.”

COURT OF CONTROL

John Thomas, an. admit-
ted rebel against the Court of
Control last fall, turned his at-
tention from a hand of. bridge
to say, “Although the Court of
Control is a bluff, we still ought
to have it. Our class gained a
great deal of spirit from defy-
ing the Court. I think the
school will regret it if the
Court is abolished.”

So these are some of the im-
pressions of freshmen after one
semester. They seem to have
adjusted well to new situations
and have some sound sugges-
ions for improvements _ that
they mey well institute during
their stay here.

This week general campus elections began, and to-

day a vote was taken on certain amendments whose pass-
age will expedite the elections procedure. Last year this
column advocated certain fundamental changes in the
elections system. Apparently the Word was heard by
some for an Elections Committee was organized to make
definite proposals for changes in the present system.

POPULARITY CONTESTS

Most criticism has been aimed mainly at the fact
that elections are mere popularity contests, that candi-
dates promise much but do little or nothing when once
in office, that the Student Council does not always re-
flect the wishes of its constitutents, and that there are
no means within the Constitution by which inefficient
officers may be removed from office.

The long-lost “Peden Amendment” provided a so-
lution to the first problem by way of an “open” elec-
tions system, but did nothing more and was thus defeated.

“OPEN” ELECTIONS SYSTEM

Perhaps the Davidson elections system can be made
more fluid, freer, and energetic by the passage of two
amendments to our Constitution — one providing for
an “open” elections system and the other, for a recaii
of inefficient office-holders. The former would call for
an elections board composed of a member from each fra-
ternity and independent social organization which would
govern all elections independent of the Student Council.

Combines,

combinations,

conspiracies and_ rallies

would be legalized. Candidates would sign a pledge that
neither they nor any member of their political organiza-
tion violated any elections regulation. Penalties for in-
fractions of the rules would consist of disqualification
of candidates — or removal from office.

RECALL BY PLEBISCITE

The recall amendment would provide the means for
removal of an office-holder. Upon the presentation of a pe-
tition signed by at least one-third of the student body to
the elections board, a plebiscite would be held for the re-
moval of the officer. Passage of the plebiscite would re-
quire a three-fourths margin of the total votes cast.

These. proposals are not necessarily what should be,
but are in essense what ought to be. A new Student Coun-
cil is being elected. Will they take the lead in offering

a new way?”

' THE PH'LOSOPHES

Buttrick

We were quite fortunate in
having the opportunity to feel
the dynamic freshness of
George Buttrick. Davidson
would do well to strive in her
total program for what is rep-
resented in the person of Dr.
Butirick, namely the whole
Spectrum of experience inter-
preted from the foci of Chris-
tian commitment and human
freedom. “The earth is the
Lord’s;" pay your. money and
take your choice,” there'll be
no apologies today.

He revealed his Integrity
most fully in small, impromptu
discussions; the fact that we
cannot capture his personality
by recording several of his re-
marks does not preclude the
use of these remarks as aids to
our memories.
