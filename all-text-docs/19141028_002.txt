THE NORTH CAROLINA GAME.

The North Carolina game is in’ the
air this week, and furnishes the subject
at conversation on every occasion. Day:
idson men are stirred up as they have not
been ior years over the splendid showing
which the team has made, “The Red
and Black Electric. Machine has shawn
itself superior to every cleven that it has
met. ‘This is due to the high-class
coaching’ of Ferzer and Harris, and in
the games to the cheering and backing
jrom the sidelines. Vhe men on the
team feel that they have the support of
every manin the student body, and vof
the hast of alumni. and these in’ turn
have the utmost confidence in the Team.
The result is a stronger unity: between.
the plavers and the hundreds of David
son men who are watching them than
there has been since the tamous divs ot
1903-1907.

Next Saturday Davidson will fight
out its hardest hattle of the whole season
with the mighty Varhecls. All the tol-
lowing games Davidson’ is confident of
winning, Will we win this one? Faw
years ago, when Davidson mer Carolina,
every odd, as it is this vear, was against
her. Carolina had a powerful cleven,
and was aspiring toward the Southern
championship. At 32300 one Saturday
afternoon, the ‘Tarheels were marching
into the game, confident of victory, “Tywo
hours fater, the: proud warriors were
leaving the field, bowed and crushed by
a 6-0 defeat at the hands of the fighting
and furious Electric Machine put out by
Simpson.

Last Saturday great Vale “Vieers of
the Foot Ball World, were humbled in
the’ dust by Washington and Jefferson,
a college of three hundred. And yet
thou savest. “What are. we against so
many 2” a

The Charlotte News predicts a 21-?
victery for Carolina, We are not pre-
dicting. We know that it) Davidson
fiights hard, tights hard tike it has in
games past, and if every loval Davidson
man will stand behind this team with
might and power next Saturday after-
noon, foot ball fandom will be furnish:
ed a big surprise, and Davidson men the
world over will rise up in pride.

There will be two Pep-rally meetings
this week on Wednesday and Friday
nights, Every student, whether he eoes
to Winston or not, should attend these
meetines, to contribute his share to them
And when, on Saturday, the north-bound
train berins to pull out, it should carry
on board and it will. a force in enthus-
jasm, and determination, and spirit, that
will help the team to stop short of noth-
ing but its very best.

THE COTTAGE CAMPAIGN.

It is heartily agreed by all college
leaders that one of the wreatest moulding
forces in Southern studert life today is
the summer rathering at Robert E. Lee
Hall, in the Blue Ridge of North Caro-
lina. Any man ought to consider it a
privilese to have part in the building un
of so far-reaching and = powerful an
agency. A campaign is now  beine
launched: here whereby Davidson will

raise half the cost of one of the ten cot-
rages which are to be built on the Blue;
by ten Southern colleges.
“cone hundred dollars,
but evers man who feels the value of
such a dynamic moral and religious force
among Southern students, whether he is
ever able to go to one of the conferences
or not, will always be glad if he has a
part, no matter how small, in) giving
Davidson a permanent home at Blue
Ridge.

THANKS.

Every student and alumni of David-
son appreciates the support that they
have been given in athletics in the promi-
nent papers of the State, especially in the
Charlotte News. “This paper has cer
tainly given us their support and praised
our athletics very much. In writing to
authorities here the News said: “We
consider that Charlotte is Davidson's
town and that Davidson is, more or less.
Charlorte’s college, therefore this town
and its papers should faver Davidson in
the way of news as much as possible.”

We feel sure that we express the sen-
timents of every Davidsonian in thank-:
ing this paper for what they have said!
and done for us. J. H.C.

the interests of the Alumni Athletic As-'
sociation, “This organization, which was’

formed here last Commencement, has!

already done much for the athletics of
the college both in a financial way and

lin securing. an eficient coaching staff.

Vhat their efforts have been of some
avail is shawn by the increased pep in
both the team and the student bods. and
in the manner that the team has handled
itself. “The athletic prospects here are
brighter than thev have been for several
years past, and if those alumni who are
already interested will continue — their
