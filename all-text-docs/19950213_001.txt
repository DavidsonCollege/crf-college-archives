Trustees discuss new science center

Rosenbach, Gullan express SGA concerns

By Jay JENNINGS
Staff writer

The Board of Trustees held their tradi-
tional February meeting to discuss the bud-
get for 1995-96 and the new Life Science
Center last week.

The trustees usually discuss the budget
at the February meeting, but the new Life
Science Center added something new for
them to consider. A group of faculty and
staff, called the Life Science Center Plan-
ning Committee, has worked with Jenkins-
Peer Architects of Charlotte to formulate a
plan to linka free-standing life science build-
ing with an atrium to Dana Science building.

The trustees announced a fund raising

team and had the architects desplay the
design.

This new structure will bring Biology
and Psychology offices, classroom, and labs
together in the new Life Science Center.
This will also combine the facilities for lab
animals that currently are maintained sepa-
rately by each department.

Eddie Gordon, a junior biology major,
believes that this expansion is “long over-
due” because of the great demand for biol-
ogy resources at Davidson.

Former SGA President Eric Rosenbach
also talked to the trustees about the religious

Triples
again
in ’95?

By JENNIFER KERNS"
Staff writer

Accoranng tothe Adinissions
Office, more than 3,000 students
have applied to Davidson this year.
Of these applicants, Davidson in-
tends to accept around 1,000, ex-
pecting 430 to enter the Class of
1999.

The Enrollment Committee,
consisting of RLO Director Rich-
ard Terry, Registrar Polly Griffin,
Executive Assistant to the Presi-
dent John Kelton, and Controller
Ed Kania, dictates the target figure
for acceptances. Admissions re-
sponds to the committee by focus-
ing on specific areas and only re-
cruiting a set amount of students.
The committee examines the re-
sources of housing, classroom
space, and class availability to de-
termine a target number.

Although the class of 1998’s
30 person increase from the target
number of 430 does not seem dras-
tic, the results are long-reaching.

_ VALENTINES
Will you be mine?

By Betu LINDSEY
Staff writer

As yet another Valentine’s

Day approaches,..many. students.

across the Davidson campus with-
out sweethearts express a cynical
attstude toward the holiday. Yet

1 for others, this Valentine’s Day is

an extra-special one, for that spe-
cial person with whom they cel-
ebrate is also the one with whom
they plan to spend the rest of their
life.

Senior Creigh Wheeler has

| been engaged to Davidson alum

Jamie Brown for 14 months now.
After spending a semester abroad
in Australia, Creigh arrived in the
airport at 6:30 a.m. on a Saturday
morning only to find her boyfriend

| holding an engagement ring.

Says Wheeler, “I have to ad-
mit the idea of a such a big commit-
ment was a bit overwhelming at
first, buthe has graduated and been
out of school for two years now.
He is certainly ready, and as for the
commitment, I feel like lam ready
to handle it.”

Creigh and Jamie first met

when Creigh was a prospective
visiting Davidson. They then be-
gan dating during the fall of her
freshman year. Says Wheeler, “I
certainly did not. expect. ]
dating someone seriously during
my freshman year, nor did I ex-
pect to get married so early. I am
a firm believer, though, that when
you find someone with whom you
want to spend the rest of your life,
you just cannot let it slip by you.”

Creigh and Jamie plan a June
1995 wedding and then plan to
move to either Oregon or Mon-
tana. There they plan to pursue
further schooling and ultimately
careers in wildlife management.

Mark Ruby took the big
plunge last December when he
proposed to his longtime girl-
friend, 1994 Davidson graduate
Anna Atkinson.

Says Ruby, “To be honest,
I’ ve-been itching to do it for a long
while. Her birthday was Decem-
ber 15, and it seemed like a good
time; The year before Anna’s
mother had found out what I was

Recycling campaign demanding support

By Mary CLareE JALONICK

Concerned students want
change. A petition drawn up by
Maria Whitehead has called for
the institutionalization of recycling
on the Davidson Campus, which
would strengthen the college's re-
cycling program. In addition,

Davidson, NC 28036 -

Warren Buford and Bob Bailey
have redefined the goals of the
Campus Services and Facilities
Committee and will make the reju-
venation of campus recycling one
of their top priorities.

Along with empty aluminum
cans, plastic bottles (without caps),
and white office paper, low-grade

- paper products and cardboard can

currently be recycled. The college
cannot recycle glass, paper clips,
paper cups, or envelopes with plas-
tic windows.

As of now, the program is
mostly run by students. Physical
Plant collects the bagged
recyclables and takes them to the
shed. Then once a week, students
go the shed, located across the

tracks near Admissions, and sepa-
rate the recyclables so they can be
picked up.

Many problems exist within
the recycling program. There is
not much money allocated for re-
cycling, and as aresult the students
who volunteer are burdened with
much of the sorting. This creates a
problem on holidays and during

exam times, for the students are
the backbone of the program.
Whitehead, in conjunction
with the On-campus Service Com-
mittee, the Environmental Action
Committee, and the Recycling
Committee, wrote a petition that
was signed by at least 950 students
