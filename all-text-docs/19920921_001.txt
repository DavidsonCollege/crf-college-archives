‘ Report's sixth annual survey of
America’s best colleges, Davidson

leges in the country. Davidson

Moves Up Three in U.S. News Survey

followed by Amherst (MA),
Swarthmore (PA), Wellesley
(MA), and Pomona (CA).
Davidson was the highest ranked
southern college followed by
Washington & Lee, which came in
twenty-second.

Dean of Admissions Nancy
Cable Wells said of the ranking, “It
clearly gives us good name recog-
nition for the strength of our aca-
demics and value for the money.”

U.S. News and World Report
determines a school’s overall rank
by combining statistical data pro-
vided by the schools with the re-
sults of an exclusive survey, con-
ducted by the magazine, of aca-
demic reputations among 2,527
responding college presidents,

deans, and admissions directors.

The schools provide statistics
which measure the selectivity of
the student body, the degree to
which the school financially sup-
ports a high-quality full-time fac-
ulty, the school’s overall financial
resources as determined by the to-
tal 1991 expenditure for its educa-
tion program divided by its total
enrollment plus all other 1991
spending per student, the level of
student satisfaction, and the per-
centage of the school’s living
alumni who contributed to their
alma mater’s fund drives.

The education program figure

to provide higher educational opportunities for Charlotte area African-American students

Love of Learning Program
Strives to Break Down Barriers

By Xatrice Shuler

Members of the Davidson
community who tuned into Charles
Kuralt on August 23rd were sur-
prised to see Davidson College on
national television.

Why do we deserve such rec-
ognition? Two women, 180 Afri-
can-American students, their par-
ents, numerous college counselor- °
mentors, teachers and other indi-
viduals devoted to education: the
Love of Learning program.

Love of Learning, a five-year
sequential program for both stu-
dents and their parents, recognizes
that African-American students
face barriers in pursuing higher
education including too few text
books, gang violence and drug use.
LOL’s Director Brenda Tapia and
Assistant Director Joan Miller in
conjuction with. Charlotte-
Mecklenburg Schools attempt to
counter such obstacles.

Each year LOL selects 30 ris-

ing~African-American freshmen
from CMS to attend Davidson for
four grueling weeks of summer
classes. A unique aspect of this
program is the composition of each
class of 30.

When Tapia began the pro-
gram in 1987 she decided to focus
on the students who may “fall be-
tween the cracks.” 5 students are
selected from the top and 5 from

SGA Elections Experience Difficulties

By Tom Price

The latest Student Govern-
ment Association elections were
forced to be redone after candi-
dates for the Honor Council were
twice left off of the ballots. SGA
President Anthony Foxx described
the error as an “honest mistake.”
Foxx expressed sorrow. that the
elections had to be redone because
redoing the elections meant more

work for members of the SGA and
resulted in less students voting on
the “make-up” election day.

Elections are run by an SGA
committee called the Elections
Council. Foxx said that group has
met and discussed ways of avoid-
ing future problems. In the future,
he said, they will concentrate more
onaccuracy and less on getting the
job done quickly.

Inaseparate development, the
SGA decided to elect new mem-
bers to the Honor Council from
each of the sophomore, junior, and
senior classes. In accordance with
a vote of the Student Conduct
Council last:Spring, the elections
were to increase the number of
members on the Honor Council to

Mater as Dean of Faculty

By Meg Davis

Imagine returning to Davidson
in nineteen years to be the boss of
your past professors! This is the
situation David Shi will face when
he- returns to Furman University
on June Ist as vice president of
academic affairs and dean of fac-
ulty.

president for academic affairs has
come from outside its own facutly.
Shi, the Frontis W. Johnston Pro-
fessor of History, has been at
Davidson since he received his
Ph.D. from the University of Vir-
ginia in 1976.

Davidson and Furman have
been battling for Shi’s allegiance
since his high school days when
his college choices were narrowed
to the two schools. Even during
college Davidson gained notoriety
with Shi, as he charmed his future
wife away from a Davidson foot-

ball player. Itseems Davidson was
in the lead with Shi, former chair
of the history department, in his
seventeenth year.

Furman, with only four years
to their credit, will win Shi back on
June Ist. The evolution of Shi
from professor to administrator was
not a process he even considered

unique circumstances” began wi
acall from the president of Furman
nine months ago. President John
E. Johns asked if Shi would be
willing to become a candidate for
the position of vice president of
academic affairs and dean of fac-
ulty.

Although Shi would not have
accepted an offer like this from
any other school, his allegiance to
his alma mater motivated him to
accept. In addition, both Shi’s and
his wife’s parents now reside in the
