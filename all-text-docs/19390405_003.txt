THE DAVIDSONIAN

Question

of the Week

Accusations, by the Student Coun-

cil, toward various fraternities of
forming combines in Campus Elec-
tions, have prompted this week’s
question. It is a vital question, one
which can be decided only by stu-
dent opinion. For this reason, we
have chosen the following for the
Question of the Week: “Are you in
favor of open elections on the Da-
vidson Campus?” From the stu-
dents’-here questioned, the opinion
seems to run highly in favor of open
politics and elections.

Scotty Raynal, Senior:

“The way I look at it, it seems
hypocritical to try to have elections
on the campus without some poli-
ticing. We will either have to have
open politics or some active steps
taken by the Student Council to
curb all politics. I am not in favor
of absolutely open politics as they
have in some Universities, but I
think they should recognize the
fact that there are politics going on
and should take steps to keep them
at a minimum.”

Hector McLean, Ss ophomore:

“Even though the system of open
politics is what we will have to con-
tend with in later life, it seems to
me that Davidson, as a school, is
much too small to enable such a
System to be successful. The David-
son College political system has its
evils, but at the same time, we can
say that in the majority of cases
the most capable men are usually
elected to fill the offices. If a policy
of open politics were adopted, I
think that it would tend to jeopard-
ize the operation of what should be,
with a little more cooperation from
the students, a fair and satisfactory
system as we have it now, and
cause strife among the students in
that it would allow practically any-
one to be elected to fill positions
which actually demand the best
material that Davidson College has
‘to offer.”

Charles MacArthur, Sophomore:

“Yes, I am in favor of open poli-
tics on the Davidson campus, be-
cause by such a practice each can-
didate’s qualifications will be
brought to light, whereas, under the
Present conditions a-large majority
that vote, vote for a name and not
what the person has done. Then,
too, I do not believe that so-called
combines can be done away with,
so why not bring it all out in the
form of open politics?” f

Archer Torrey, Senior:

“I think open politics will have
several advantages: (1) Frankness
will be substituted for hypocrisy,
(2) Men will be provided with train-
ing in politics and everybody will
take a more active interest in Stu-
dent Government, (3) Officers will
be more evenly distributed among
Fraternities, (4) On the whole, bet-
ter men will be elected; at least,
they will be just as good, and (5)
It will be a lot more fun.”

Pete Marchant, Junior:

“I certainly am in favor of open
politics. We need something around
here to liven up things and cam-
paign speeches, and other parts of
true politics should wake the place
up a bit.”

Bill Diehl, Senior:

“In view of the present impoten-
cy of the body that runs elections
on the Davidson Campus, we should
indeed, have open politics. This will
promote fair play in our student
elections. Open politics will enable
us to elect men more for qualifica-
tions than reward. Furthermore,
open politics is the will of the stu-
dent body.”

Tom Mullen, Senior:

“No, I am not in favor of open
politics or elections on the David-
son campus. To my mind, the main
consideration for this viewpoint is
the college itself, its size, and its
type. I mean by this, Davidson's
difference from a large state uni-
versity, with its many separate
schools such as Medicine, Engineer-
ing, etc. In such an institution there
is no close contact between all the
students as there is at Davidson.
Consequently, in a large university
there is really a need for a politi-
cal organization to find candidates
and bring them forward. However,
at Davidson, I believe I can truth-
fully say that any candidate for

, any office is personally known by a
\ majority of his fellow students. So,
Nex this reason I am sure that the
ost capable man will almost in-
\tiably be chosen.

Of probable interest to David-

quotation frdm the Charlotte Ob-

server of March thirty-first. T. D.
Kemp in his interesting feature
“Time” says: “that splendid re-

porter John P. McKnight, describ-
ing the surrender of Madrid tells
how happy the people were to get
decent food after all these months.”

The cheering, singing, sobbing
multitude of men, women, and chil-
dren danced through the
yelling ‘Viva Franco’.

One little girl told Mr. McKnight
that they had eating
dogs, and cats—and liked it
That is the reason why you don't
see any dogs or cats on the streets.
When cats were gone the city was
full of big rats. At the end the peo-
ple were selling them for food.

Mr. McKnight was graduated
from Davidson in 1928. He was very
prominent on the campus, some of
his outstanding activities were: Phi
Beta Kappa, Sigma Upsilon, Inter-
national relations club, President
of the Spanish Club, Omega Phi
Alpha, Reporter’s club, Class _his-
torian, winner of oratorical medal,
Chameleon staff, Quips and Cranks
staff, Debating, Spanish
class poet.

Mr. McKnight has been for some
months in Spain getting an inside
view of the Spanish Civil War for
a New York Syndicate.

Riflers Take
Tight Contest

Jay Bolin Shoots High With
181 Out Of 200

The Davidson rifle team nosed
out the Kannapolis Rifle and Pistol
Club by the close score of 878 to
874 in a thrilling, hotly-contested
match fired here on the gallery
range last Friday night.

Jay Bolin, leading the local sharp-
shooters, chalked up a new school
record for  shoulder-to-shoulder
competition with the amazing score
of 181 out of a possible 200.

Five men from each team fired
for a possible 200 making the high-
est possible team score 1,000.

R. O. T. C. officers said that they
felt that this victory was particu-
larly significant, because the Kan-
napolic club has a very high rating
throughout the state and ranked
very well at the national matches
at Camp Perry, Ohio.

“We are particularly gratified ov-
er this improvement,” said Major J.
L. Ballard, “because the same team
defeated us by a margin of 73
points on February 25. “We feel
quite proud of this evident im-
provement.”

The will en-
counter the same team once more
on Wednesday, April 12, and will
end the season with a match with
Clemson here on April 15.

Seniors Vote
On Class Gift

At a smoker to be held at 8:00
P. M. Tuesday night, April 11, the
Senior class will probably take the
final vote on the type of gift it is
to leave with Davidson as a memo-
rial.

John Reisner, chairman of the
Senior Gift Committee, stated that
any new suggestions will be gladly
received by either Locke White,
Charlie Sample, or himself. The
latest suggestion an apparent dark
horse in the bunch is that a large
bench or a row of bleachers be
set up on the bumming corner. This
has been ‘suggested from year to
year but has always missed out by
a narrow margin. Someone suggest-
ed building a new gym.

Among other screwy suggestions
from the fanciful seniors is a
sprinkling system to be _ installed
over the Armory to make R. O.
T. C. officers think it is raining on
drill days. A ring around the cind-
er track on Richardson field, a
project for improving the center
of the fraternity court and install-
ing a fish pool there, and a light-
ing system for Chambers audito-
rium have also been considered.

Schoolmate of Woodrow Wil-
son Makes Special Trip
To See Campus

“Davidson is. charming!”
This was the opinion of the
college expressed last week by
Dr. John Howell Westcott,
professor emeritus. of Latin
and Roman Law at Princeton
and for over forty years a
friend of Woodrow Wilson.

The retired professor, who knew
Davidson's greatest alumnus first
as a student at™Princeton, then as
a colleague on that faculty, and fia-
ally as president of the United Stat-
es, made a special trip here last
Friday to see for himself the first
campus that Wilson knew. The gen-
eral layout, he observed, with its
old brick buildings and simple quad-
rangle is very similar to hundreds
of colleges throughout the country
which grew up the
teenth century.

One thing which highly interested
the Princeton professor, however,
was the lack of femininity at David-
son, Dr. Westcott was puzzled when

during nine-

he saw no girls on the campus dur-
ing his stay here. This, he explain-
ed, placed Davidson in an entirely
original class. Chapel Hill,
is like Davidson in many respects,

which

has its co-eds, and several schools
Florida “look like the
kind with so many girls.”
Dr. Westcott, who graduated from
in 1877, first knew the
future president when he entered
that school in September, 1875. At
this time, he explained, Wilson was

almost as mature as he was in later

life. When Woodrow returned to
“Old Nassau” as professor of law
and jurisprudence, he and Profes-

sor Westcott, already an establish-
ed member of this famous faculty,
were again thrown into an intimate
contact. Later Wilson rose to the
presidency of Princeton, and here
he demonstrated the crusading spir-
it against engulfing odds which the
world later felt during and after the
World War. Dr. Westcott
visited the White House, but when

Locke White announced today
that all the Honorary fraterni-

shortly after May 10th he is go-

Allegory of Climbing ‘Ladder |
to Heaven is Considered
In Address

Taking his text from the
twenty-eighth chapter of Gen-
esis, the passage on Jacob’s
vision at Bethel, Rev. Watt M.
Cooper of the Presbyterian
Church .of North Wilkesboro,
addressed Vespers last Sunday
evening on the climb to heaven
and heaven on earth.

Prior to his assuming his post at
North Wilkesboro, he was affiliated
with the church at
Chapel Hill as student pastor over

Presbyterian

a period of three years.
