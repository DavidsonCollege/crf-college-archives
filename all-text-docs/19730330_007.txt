Throughout the interviews,
several common thoughts
emerged wich were strikingly
similar in tone and content,
most notably that there was a
need at Davidson for a program
like the Honors College

“The college needs a
program tor students that have
the maturity to do independent
study outside of the highly
structured rules of the college.”
said Thom Nicoll.

Ralph Peeples agreed saying.
“The Honors College still offers
a degree of flexibility not often
found in the curriculum.”

An almost unanimous
agreement among the six was
that the committee's con-

“The report) was oin-

“The tirst 29 pages had valid

Independence Or Elitism?
Student Opinions Vary Widely

By JIM PAULSEN
Contributing Editor

Student opinion concerning
the Honors College ts varied en-
compassing both those who teel
that the Honors College
provides new avenues tor in-
dependent study and those who
are bothered by the taint of
elitism and separateness ot the
Honors College program

“There are things that I like
and that I don't like I like the
chance to be able to pursue an
accelerated course ot study,
free trom the — normal
requirements and using all the
resources available.” said Eric
Walker

“Tam opposed to vanking oul

having them teach only a tew

College. he continued

Many students agree with the
Hexibihty and mereased: scope
of activities that the Honors
College offers. however. there
IS a fechny among some stu
dents that the Honors College is
too disassociated trom: the col

‘TD thnk ina was the Honors

College has set up a kind ot elite
group and needs to be brought
iveloser contact with the rest of
the college.” said Tad Barnes

Concurring in this view, Bill
Crosland said. “The Honors
College doesn't relate to the
whole college Some people
think of it only as a place to
study. Because it is separated
from the college community.

or effect. from the Honors

Some students suggest that
the program should be
reworked — or completely
changed “He the college as
taking the steps to do away with
the Honors College. then T think
they should take the important
step of making the whole school
an honors college. and do away

With petty requirements.” said
Steve Canterbury

Several students who were
questioned opposed the

elinnnation oof the Honors
College program “TE think itis
quite a worthwhile program but
itis difficult ot run at Davidson
College because the school is
small Tt takes time. money and

professors.” said Mary Turner

“I dont think they should
abolish it. because in the lonp
run the Honors’College may be
beneficial to the school. It
hasn't been given an adequate
trial period.” said Turner

“The Honors College should
not be abolished because it is
untair to those who have set up
programs which would not
otherwise be offered.” said
Shaul Saddick
