Crosses still create controversy

Jennifer Solberg

Still searching for diversity

G.P. Diminich

In defense of Christian tradition

Iam writing in response
to Cormac Conner’s letter
regarding the three crosses
erected in front of Chambers
before Easter Break. Accord-
ing to Conner, because the
crosses were placed in front
of Chambers, instead of a
more innocuous location
such as a church, they
“forced” the Christian faith
on the religious minorities
on campus. He claims that
these crosses illustrate the
lack of cultural acceptance
at Davidson and cries for a
heightened awareness and
respect for the multi-
culturalism on campus.

I must admit that I was
not surprised when I read
this letter. It reeked of the
“Cultural Diversity” fervor
that has spread more ram-
pant that conjunctivitis on
this campus. I object, how-
ever, to Conner’s claim that
these crosses represent the
evil of closed-mindedness
that should be beaten out of
our sheltered little heads.

On the contrary, I be-
lieve that his letter itself is
witness to the failure of the
Cultural Diversity move-
ment on this campus. We
have been expected to be
mindful of other points of
view on campus, yet the
movement has not been pro-
gressive. This is because we
have not been taught to re-
spect other cultures. We
have been taught only to ac-
commodate them.

Don’t misunderstand

me. I believe that, if ap-
proached correctly, the con-
cept behind Cultural Diver-
sity could succeed. I believe
that if one can learn from
someone different from
themselves, they should do
so.

At Davidson, however,
we have not been educated
in the acceptance of other
cultures. We have been
taught that the majority must
be subordinate to the minor-
ity because majorities are,
as a rule, oppressive.

The debate over the
crosses in front of Cham-
bers is proof that the Cul-
tural Diversity has harmed
the majority. This is not the
first time a display was set
up in the exact location as
the crosses, yet it is the first
time anyone has objected to
it. For example, the FLAG
display last semester was not
commented on, while it defi-
nitely advocated a particular
prospective.

The reason it was left
untouched by the Cultural
Diversity police is that itrep-
resented a minority at
Davidson. The crosses rep-
resented an equally legiti-
mate group on campus. The
only difference was that the
group happened to be the
Christian majority.

What the Cultural Di-
versity movement has done
is.to suppress the values of
the majority while welcom-
ing those of the minority
groups. Members of the

majority have been taught
that they are oppressive,
overwhelming, and closed-
minded. One could almost
say that they have been
taught their mind-set is infe-
rior because it is so dominat-
ing.

Ideal Cultural Diver-
sity, however, has nothing
to do with a majority-minor-
ity relationship. It has to do
with the coexistence of mul-
tiple mind-sets, each respect-
ing the validity of the others.
‘Itis notimportant how many
individuals hold a particular
opinion. An idea is just as
valid if one person holds it
as if one hundred people hold
it.

I realize the crosses
may have made a significant
number of people uneasy.
The FLAG display made
many people uneasy as well,
and I admit to being one of
those people. Does that
mean the FLAG display

' should have been placed

elsewhere, where I wouldn’t
have been forced to see it on
the way to class? I think not.
Cultural Diversity has noth-
ing to do with uneasiness. It
has to do with acceptance.
This acceptance must go
both ways. Just as the ma-
jority must accept the
minority’s culture, the mi-
nority must also accept the
majority’s culture. A cross
is as valid as an AIDS rib-
bon. This must be under-
stood in order for Cultural
Diversity to work.

Iam writing inresponse
to the letter “Cultural Diver-
sity Davidson Style,” sub-
mitted by Cormac Conner in
the April 24 issue of The
Davidsonian. I strongly dis-
agree with Mr. Conner’s
contention that the crosses
placed on the Chambers front
lawn “forced” the views of
Christianity uponnon-Chris-
tian members of the
Davidson community and
that the crosses do not create
an “ideologically open at-
mosphere” fornon-Christian
students.

First and foremost,
Davidson is a Presbyterian
institution and maintains
close ties to the Presbyterian
Church. According to the
school’s Statement of Pur-
pose, “Davidson commits
itself to a Christian tradition
that recognizes God as the

source of all truth and, and .

finds in Jesus Christ the rev-
elation of that God.” Thus,
as a Christian college,
Davidson commits itself to
celebrating Jesus’ death and
resurrection, represented by
the crosses placed in front of
the Chambers. Therefore,
Mr. Conner should not be
shocked by their presence.
Second, I take issue with
Mr. Conner’s belief that the
crosses, which symbolize
Christianity, “forced” the
views of Christianity on non-
Christians. The. front of
Chambers is used to make
people aware of issues con-
cerning the campus, whether
by FLAG displays, fliers, etc.
The presence of the
crosses did not coerce people
to accept Christian beliefs,
but instead made people
more aware of Christ’s sal-

vation. When FLAG had its
kiosk display a few months
ago, I do not recall Mr.
Conner writing a letter to
The Davidsonian complain-
ing that the FLAG display
imposed FLAG’s views on
others. ;

Finally, implicit in Mr.
Conner’s argument is the
notion that the crosses cre-
ate a closed atmosphere on
the Davidson campus.

Jesus expressed his
love for everyone, and for
Mr. Conner to suggest that
the cross display leads to a
closed atmosphere is simply
ridiculous.

While I respect Mr.
Conner’s views, I do not
believe that the symbols of
Jesus’ death and resurrec-
tion should be sacrificed on
the altar of political correct-
ness and multiculturalism.

_ Why Davidson?

-Ike’s farwell statement-

Davidson College is a hard-
sell for any African-American stu-
dent. The academic reputation and
the small town atmosphere doesn’t
outweigh the culture shock the
majority of us face. Still, I chose
Davidson because I wanted a chal-
lenge, and I definitely got one. I
wanted to grow, and I grew tre-
mendously. Yet Davidson wasn’t
perfect.

Early on, I felt alienated and
alone. I was one of the few black
spots on a clean white wall. Some
of my anguish was caused by some
preset misconceptions. White stu-
dents expected me to be the stereo-
typical black, and I thought they
were all stereotypical whites. I
expected to be called “nigger” and
encouraged to leave: In other
words, things were tense because

- we allowed them to be. My alien-

ation didn’t come from those
words, or any similar actions. In-
stead I feltalienated because Ilived
in an environment which was try-
ing desperately to make me expe-
rience its finer points. There was
not one service denied me, or so it
seemed.

I was encouraged to gotocourt
parties, join a fraternity, play ulti-
mate frisbee on the lawn, and hang
out at the Backstreet Cafe. I could
listen to Dave Matthews Band and
admire all the white pictures on the
walls. My hallmates invited me
everywhere, until they realized my
level of interest. It seemed I could
do anything I wanted, besides be
myself. No one asked me who I
was or what I liked. I am for
cultural diversity, but I still need to
celebrate the positive aspects of
my own culture.

After I got over this I realized
something. BecauseI ama student
here, that means I am Davidson.
Yes, Davidson is a conservative,
white, Southern, liberal arts col-
lege. But now, because of me, it is
also African-American, liberal, and
Southern. Then I started to notice
the BSC and a minority Dean of
Students Office. I was proud that
Spike Lee and Maya Angelou
spoke at my school. I was proud
that African-American history was
taught as a class and talked about
in forums. I was encouraged to
know that all the good and bad of
Davidson reflected the good and
bad of Isaac Jerome Bailey. For
four years Ihave seen Davidson do
a lot to make me comfortable, but
enough hasn’t been done yet.

One tenured African-Ameri-
can in over a century and a half

doesn’t encourage me. Allowing
the African-American history
course to be put on hold for an
entire year doesn’t encourage me

either. I would love to have stud-

ied under at least one African-
American male PhD., but Davidson
didn’t allow me that luxury. Cul-
tural diversity starts with the stu-
dent body but should not end here.
I wanted to see more black pictures
on the walls and not just during the
shortest month of the year.
Davidson has done a lot, but it
needs to do more.

The administration can insti-
tute every multi-cultural program
possible, yet that still would not be
enough without the help of stu-
dents. White students have to be
more willing to step-out of their
comfort zones. African-American
students have to be willing to face

up to the resistance they will face
when trying to speak out. Other
minority students must not allow
everything to become “black and
white” issues because they, too,
have concerns.

Davidson has made me grow
and allowed me to love. Davidson
has made me more open minded,
butI shouldn’tlearn through alien-
ation. There must be a better way.
If I had to choose again, I would
return to Davidson.

Despite my hardships and
complaints, Davidson gave me ev-
erything I need to succeed in my
future life.

Davidson has made me real-
ize that hate never defeats hate,
and fear will never be erased with
silence.

I am Davidson and so are
you.
