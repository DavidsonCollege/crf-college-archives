New Religious Emphasis Week
Corrects Many Faults of Old

The decision of the YMCA to cut out the present policy
of special services in the spring and fall next year and con-
solidate the two into a single religious emphasis week at the
beginning of second semester, will be a judicious step toward
improving the whole religious program on the campus.

We hope that this religious emphasis week will become
the permanent policy after next year, and feel that its success
will dictate its adoption.

Among the many advantages to be gained under the new
set-up will be the proposed co-operation with a national or-
ganization with wide experience in advising and setting up
religious emphasis weeks on campuses throughout the coun-

This group, the University Christian Mission, not only
helps lay plans for such programs, but secures speakers from
a large selection of men who have a message and an appeal
for college students. These men work through the organiza-
tion for a minimum expense fee. Among their number are
many of the outstanding leaders of Christian thought and
action.

We are in agreement with those who believe that too
much preaching can be at least as bad as too little, especially
when it comes with little preparation and enthusiasm among
those who are to hear it. The new set-up will allow plenty of
time for planning and study among those who are interested
both before and after the week itself. Thouigh many of the
fall and spring services of the past have been eminently
worthwhile, they have suffered from the widespread belief
that they are just one more opportunity for “somebody to
preach to us.”

With the effort of those planning the services abetted by
an experienced national group, and concentrated into a single
effort, we believe that the new program—though consisting
of less preaching—will have a far better chance of having far-
reaching effects among students here, who sometimes feel
they become immune to religion through an overexposure to
the preaching aspect of it.

Need For Whole Blood Continues
Though Hostilities Have Ceased

Hostilities in Korea have subsided but the need of blood,
and, of course, of blood donors is still with us.

It is hard to muster a lot of enthusiasm for a blood drive
without the added impetus of men falling wounded on the
field of battle, where maybe a pint of blood can mean the
difference between life and death in the space of a few
minutes.

But though the drama is gone, still its after effects left
with us in the form of men with shattered bodies, whose only
hope for regaining any semblance of health lies in a series
of tedious and painful operations.

These operations are not possible when the blood banks
have run dry, because many of them necessitate numerous
transfusions. Modern science can work many miracles, but it
cannot manufacture this needed whole blood; it has to come
from people willing to give it.

It takes a little time to donate blood, and it’s a little in-
convenient and uncomfortable. But its also a little incon-
venient and uncomfortable to lie crippled in a veterans’ hos-
pital with one’s only hope in surgery that is also a little incon-
venient and uncomfortable. There are people whose return
to health and happiness depends on the supply of whole
blood. Let’s insure them of the future they have a right to
expect from the people and nation who expected so much
from them.

group of Davidson men, engaged
in pursuit of certain fraternity
pledges who had attempted a re-
volt, chanced upon a parked auto-
mobile which they seemed to
recognize as that of the fugitives.

The vehicle, a 52 DeSoto sedan,
was parked in a small grove of elm
and popular in the vicinity of Con-
cord Road, well away from the
main thoroughfare and at a dis-
tance of five or six miles from the
town. The car lights were out, and
all was quiet. The pursuers, con-
gratulating themselves on their
keen observation and alert fore-
sight, parked their car at some
distance from the place and pro-
ceeded stealthily on foot. Con-
fident that the neophytes believed
their hiding place secured and un-
detected, the men agreed to effect
the capture swiftly and silently,
seizing them altogether by sur-
prise.

At the edge of the clearing they
stopped, deliberated for a moment,
and then disbanded, surrounding
the car on all sides. At a given
signal, one man darted from the
shadow of the trees and jerked
open the front right door, diving
onto the seat. A shout was
heard: “Okay, I've got the keys—
let’s get ‘em!” Whereupon the
others rushed screaming and
cursing from the woods. The first
man to reach the opposite side

Owen Leland, Senior,

By Mid-April, Maybe

Scripts ‘n Pranks, the clarion
call of militant young American
apathy originally scheduled for
final 1953-54 publication today,
hit a technical snag this week
causing a slight delay, Editor Alden
Williams revealed yesterday.

Appearing three times during the
college year during the months of
October, February and April, Wil-
liams said that it will be “a matter
of days—a month, roughly, before
the poor man’s Seventeen makes
its last, and best, splash in the
ebbtide of Davidson entertain-
ment.”

The April number features the
art work of Don Mahy, photog-
raphy by Gene Auten, and the
“best prose since the heyday of
the Algonquin Round Table,” with
the theme being “one of surprise.”

“In fact,” he added, “I'm anxious
to see what’s in the next Scripts
‘n Pranks myself. It hasn't been
written yet.”

As for manuscripts from the stu-
dent body at large, Wednesday,
March 31, was announced as the
deadline for these, whether poetry
or prose. “In the case of equal
merit,” the editor stated, “pref-
erence will probably be shown to
seniors. We hope, however, to
keep all the material, serious or
light, artistically on a par with
the Vereen Bell and Willa Cather
award winning papers which we
hope to publish.”

At approximately 2 a.m. on the,of the car opened the door and
morning of Monday, March 16, ajcried out in a loud voice: “All

right, you've had it!” He shined
his flashlight on the front seat.
There huddled closely together,
startled and afraid, were a young
Negro girl and her escort.
Sprawled over then with the keys
in his hand was the would-be cap-
tor of pledges.

The other young man, mindful
always of those social graces
which must be brought to bear in
every situation quickly doffed
his hat and said: “I beg your par-
don; we seem to have the wrong
party.” And then he ran.

The particulars of the subsequent
flight to safety were unfortunately
lost in the chaotic scramble which
ensued. This much, however, has
been ascertained: Our men were
pursued into town and onto the
campus by the owner of the De-
Soto, who stopped them here and
demanded a logical explanation of
their actions, which, unfortunately,
the former were unable to furnish
him. His companion was quite
shaken up, and he himself was
indignant and uncompromising. At
last, however, reluctant to pass
more time in such unwelcome
company thus ungraciously thrust
upon him, he started his car and

drove away.

We have not been informed
what became of the pledges in
question.

Dr. Sam Spencer, assistant to
the president, announced today
that all applications for grants-
in-aid and remissions except for
athletic grants-in-aid must be made
by April 15. Consideration cannot
be guaranteed for applications re-
ceived later than that date. Appli-
cation blanks for grants-in-aid may
be secured from Dr. Spencer’s of-
fice, Room 113, Chambers Build-
ing.

(at Diamond Kine (Cat Netters Face Powerful

To Mee! L-R Bears

After failing to break into the
win column in five starts on their
southern trip to open the season
the Wildcat baseballers-‘make their
North Carolina debut on Monday
as they hit the appleknockers of
Lenoir Rhyne College on the
Hickory diamond.

The Bears are a newcomer to
the Cat slate and are an unkonwn
quantity as this will be their open-
ing game of the season. The Cats
gained some valuable experience
on the spring trip, and Coach
Clements now has a little more to
go on in his choice of starters.

Good Showing

The Cats played some good ball
on the trip, but just couldn’t seem
to put across the runs in the
clutches. Perhaps the outstanding
game of the series was the Georgia
Teachers encounter which was lost
only by the Georgians having one
big inning, scoring all three in that
frame. Lanky Lindley Beardsley
turned in an eight-hit pitching job
in going all the way’ in that en-
counter.

Other highlights of the trip were
a fourhit pitching job by Johnny
Smith against Fort Jackson, and
a bases loaded homer by Billy
Morris against Parris Island,

After Monday's date with the
Bears the Cats will hit Washington
and Lee University in two games
on the local diamond on Friday
and Saturday in their home debut.

LINKSTERS HOSTS
TO OHIO WESLEYAN

Davidson’s Varsity golf team
squares off against the links team
from Ohio Wesleyan next Thurs-
day in a match which will mark
the opening of the home season for
the Davidson spring sport teams.

The golfers had a rough time of
it on the spring trip into the
outheastern states where golf is
a year-round sport. After winning
their opening contest of the season

the team lost the three remaining
matches of the tour in rapid suc-
cession.

Upon returning from the trip,
Coach Elgin White had high praise
for Joe Jenkins and Skipper Hall,
who led the Cats’ scoring on the
trip. Both boys played very good
golf, with Hall being the only
player on the team to win all of
his matches.

Volleyball, Tennis Set
Next For The Greeks

The next two sports on the interfraternity docket -get
underway on Monday as volleyball and tennis take the Greek
spotlight. Thé schedules for both have been posted and the
competition in these two sports will bring the Greek sports
activity into the home stretch of this year’s season.

Freshman Netters
To Open Workouts

Wildkitten tennismen get into
the swing of their spring practice
sessions Monday as the workouts
open under Coach McKee. Some

Coach Heath Whittle, director
of interfraternity athletics, an-
nounced yesterday that several
changes will be made in the vol-
leyball setup this year with an
accelerated program of scheduling
among the changes. The season
must be run off in two weeks this
year as the basketball team will
move into the gym on April 12

good prospects seem to be in order|¢or spring drills and the volleyball

for the frosh who boast several
very fine performers.

The frosh schedule will be most-
ly with local high schools and the
only definite matches on the slate
to date are two with Myers Park
High. Coach McKee announced re-
cently that the frosh slate will in-
clude some six or eight matches
when it is completed.

tournament must be completed by
that time. Each team will play
twice each afternoon in order to
finish the season by that time.

Rules Changed
The volleyball rules have also
been changed in that a victory will
be decided by the best 2 of 3
games (games will consist of either
15 points or 10 minutes time,
whichever comes first), and in
that way each team must supply
a referee and a timer. Either 6 or

9 man teams are optional.

Coach McKee feels, however that
with the coming now of warmer
spring weather the Cats will come
along quickly to develop their great
potential. The Michigan State team
stands as a very interesting show-
ing of the Cats’ skill and will show
some indication of the way the
team will shape up for the season.

State, Sewanee Here

Sewanee is scheduled to make
its yearly appearance on the local
courts for two matches next Friday
and Saturday. The Cats beat
Sewanee last year and dropped to
Michigan State’s Big Ten champs.

Said Coach McKee of the recent
spring trip, “We couldn't seem to
get rolling, especially in the
singles, with our lack of adequate
practice time prior to those
matches really hurting us. I was
greatly pleased with the showings
in doubles where we were a little
weak last year.”

Clark Hot

Corky Clark was possibly the
hottest of the netters on the trip
as he copped all three of his
singles matches, two doubles
matches, and was leading in the
doubles match at Florida which
was called on account of darkness.

Johnny - Bremer and Corky
Johnson also showed up well, but
