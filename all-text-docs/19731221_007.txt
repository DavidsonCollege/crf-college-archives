was simply a tough loss to a
good team.

saying, ‘“We’ve just been out
quicked underneath, if we
play in front of their big men
then the ball is just lobbed
over our heads; if we play
behind them then they have

been going around us.”’

Against Princeton, the Cats
used more of a zone defense
than they usually . The
defense forced the Tigers into
committing many turnovers
and forced bad shots.

“I'd have to say that defense
ber the difference,’”’ Holland

47 points, you're doing a heck
of a job,’’ Holland continued.

Princeton had a 35 percent
field goal average in the game
as the Tigers could not move
the ball against Davidson’s
zone. Consequently, they were
forced into taking bad shots.

“‘We knew that they don’t
like to play against a zone so
we just used it more than we
have so far this season, but we
backed up on the perimeter so
that they couldn't get the ball
inside,”’ Holland said.

Leading scorer for Davidson
was John Falconi with 17 poin-

ts. Larry Horowitz and Greg
Dunn were behind Falconi
with 12 and 16 points respec-
tively.

“John played a very good
game,”’ said Holland who was
more impressed with
Falconi’s 6 rebounds.

“John really went un-
derneath and got some crucial
rebounds for us,”’ Holland
said.

Horowitz was the game’s
leading rebounder with 9.
Overall, Davidson outreboun-
ded Princeton 33 to 18, which
pleased Holland greatly.

‘In the three losses we were
getting beat on the boards and
it’s good to win underneath at
last,’ Holland commented.

The tension before the game
was evident as the players
and coaches were unable tc -
loosen up at all. After the
game Holland admitted that
the win was a big victory for
the Cats.

Davidson Receives Lively
In Recruiting Transaction

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Staff Writer

Maryland’s loss is David-
son’s gain in the case of Mar-
vin Lively, a freshman swing
man and the leading scorer for
the J.V. basketball team. Mar-
vin was originally being
recruited by Lefty Driesell
and Maryland but came to
Davidson as a result of an in-
teresting bit of ‘‘dealing’’.

Driesell and Terry Holland
have long been friends going
back to the time 13 years ago
when Driesell, then coaching
at Davidson, recruited

stay on as an assistant coach
after his graduation. Holland
replaced Driesell in 1968.
Their friendship remains and
certainly had something to do
with the recruiting of Lively.

According to Holland, he
called Driesell late in the
“recruiting season”’ to ask if
there were any good
ballplayers with grades that
might be interested in coming
to Davidson. Driesell men-
tioned Lively, whom Holland
had been interested in before.

‘“‘We had sent him a
questionaire, but he never
filled it out or sent it back to
us,’’ Holland said.

Driesell felt that he would
not really be able to use Lively
because Maryland already
had two similar ballplayers,
Mo Howard and John Lucas.

“I had been interested in.

Maryland for about three
years,” Lively said, ‘‘and I
knew Lefty Driesell was
scouting me. I had been to
some basketball camps _ at
Maryland and was pretty set

about starting.” he added. “‘I
said that I didn’t care that
much about starting but that I

did want to play.
“A few days after that
phone call, ch Holland

called me at my home in Rich-
mond and said that he had

talked to Driesell. He said that
Davidson was interested in
me. I told him that I liked
Davidson and he must have
taken me at my word because
he was in Richmond two hours
later.”’

“It was a very rapid tran-
$action of business.”’ said
Holland. ‘‘We knew that we
wanted a boy of Marvin’s

quality with us. It’s rare to
find a young man who is
president of his high school
class, has as good grades as
Marvin, and who is as good a
basketball player.

Lively names ‘‘basketball
smarts’’ as his best asset. ‘‘I
think that I have pretty good
court sense and am good at
finding the open man.”’

“‘We've all been frustrated
in the last week and now that
we won tonight, I think we
proved that we can win the im-
portant games,”’ he said.

Before the game Holland ad-
mitted that frustration was
one of the principle causes for
the loss to Richmond.

“‘We had so many chances to
put to Richmond game out of
reach, but after two losses we
would tense up and lose the

The players were also
relieved with the win and the
team nowseems ready for Fur-

Davidson now stands at 33
overall and 0-2 in the Southern
Conference, but as Holland

after the Princeton
game, ‘‘We’re 0-2 in the
