Chambers’ lawn last Saturday for

the festival would be a great way
to get the community involved be-
cause Davidson residents “are not
exposed to things of international

set up displays.” He added that

this year’s committee was “more.

ment — which grew to include
bands, dancers, drummers, etc.”

In addition, the presence of

Students constructed booths
displaying maps, posters, post-
cards and books from countries
such as France, Mexico, Nepal,
China, South Africa, Zambia,
Austria, India, Scotland, Lebanon
and Hungary. The International
House of Charlotte was also repre-
sented.

In addition to providing politi-
cal and cultural information on
these countries, several students
prepared food from the country
they represented. The Commons
also set up a concession stand of
its own. Bilal El Amine, chairman
of the International Committee,
said that one of the goals of the
festival was “to get the communi-
ty involved. However, that really
didn’t work that well’ He said;
“though the students really did

enjoy it, there were few members -

ticipation to a lack of direct pub-

leaving pamphlets at individual
homes and orally urging residents
to attend. However, he said that
overall it was a very successful
event and that “we'll have a strong
International Committee because
it was SO strong.”

Many students remarked that
it was the best festival they had
been to here. Asked why he
thought this year’s International
Day was better than those in re-
cent years, El Amine said, “In
years past, it was always held in-
side, on some obscure day, in the
Union. Everyone put their booth
together, prepared some food and

to be active. We wanted to have an

Students from five countries spending year here

By TED WILSON

Each year Davidson’s com-
munity gains a new international
flavor as students from around the
world join the student body.

This year, eight students from
Mexico, France, West Germany,
India and the People’s Republic of
China, have enrolled as one-year
students. Since these students are
only here for one year, their goals
are somewhat different from those
of the typical Davidson student
who is studying for a bachelor’s
degree in arts or science.

Berard Masse, of Montpel-
lier, France, said, “my aim is to
improve my English through
courses and experiences. and by

Beatriz Martinez, from
Guadalajara, Mexico, added, “I
want to give Davidson students an

.idea of what Mexico and other

Latin American countries are like.
They have some distorted views
such as about poverty.”

Suman Kudva, of Kernataka,

" India, said, “I’m very interested in

the American way of life and un-
derstanding this country and
people.” She also wants to “try to
‘get access to the science and tech-
nology here since this atmosphere
is the most advanced on the
planet. Since I’m so fortunate to
be here, I hope to make the best of
this opportunity by using the com-

_ puters and taking science courses,

meeting other people.” He added, etc.”

Thierry Rousset, also of
Montpellier, said his aim was to
“discover a new culture and to
present my culture to American
students.”

responses. Rousset said, “Parties!

like social drinking.” He said that
the drinking situation is due to
“the American mentality and to
Puritanism. Drinking gives us an
excuse to show desires that we
wouldn’t show when we are
sober. Americans are Puritan dur-
ing the week, but on weekends,
subliminal desires are expressed.”
Kudva said she was not
shocked when she arrived at
Davidson, because “I came pre-
pared. I .knew I was making a
transition into a new culture and I
was prepared to see something
that I’ve never seen before.”
Masse said, “it is difficult to
be an international student. We
are here more to have experiences
and not to work like an American
student. Soinetimes there is a mis-
understanding because you want
to speak with others but they

Davidson students are totally en-
globed in their work.”
Rousset, who disagrees that it

is difficult being here, said,.

“People are very reliable. I make

an effort to adapt, too, and people
try to help me.” ;

Asked about the positive and
Negative aspects of Davidson,
Masse said, as for the bad, “Com-
ing from a European point of
view, it seems like a brain factory
here — like a machine. I hope
that in the end, students can ap-
preciate some. values of life.” He
added that “people feel guilty if
they do not study on Sunday, and
sometimes this can get exagger-
ated.” However, Masse points out
‘that Davidson’s sports, club ac!
tivities, and College Union are
particularly strong here.

When asked to compare
Davidson with the University of
Montpellier, Rousset said,

- “Davidson has a very good work-

ing and social life. Everyone’s
around (whereas .n France many

something to-do. Foreigners can
be lost in Montpellier during the
first month but not in Davidson.”
Kudva compared Davidson to the

school system in India, saying,
“the educational system is better
here than in India. Schools here
should get all the encouragement
to advance their technology.” She
added, “I love the parties. You
can release all the energy that
young people have. You can
forget everything and give your-
self a break. People have so much
freedom here; it’s not a restrictive
society at all.” However, she
wars, “too much of anything
(such as drinking or smoking) can
be bad.”

Martinez dislikes the David-
son parties. “The main purpose is
to get drunk. For me, it’s not im-
portant to have alcohol at parties.”
She said that parties provide “the
only thing to do on campus during
the weekends” and that most
