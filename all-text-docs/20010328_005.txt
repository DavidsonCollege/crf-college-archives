A new species of animal will soon inhabit
Davidson’s verdant forests at the edge of
campus, and we have the latest sports rage to
thank for it. Fans of Frisbee Golf are excited
about the opening of DC’s brand new course.

DC held a tournament for seniors to com-
memorate the 18-hole monument to serious
gaming, and hard-core Frisbee players flocked
Sunday to start finessing their plastic disks.
“Neither sapling nor squirrel was out of dan-
ger,” President Bobby Vagt reminisced about
his own performance Sunday. Vagt joined a
women’s team in need of a fourth player;
unfortunately, they came in last.

The College paid only about $5,000 in cash
for the concrete and metal “holes,” but Vagt
believes that the costs of labor could bring the
total to around $15,000. Christopher Brantley,

Senior Class President and newly minted
Frisbee Golf advocate, certainly isn’t com-
plaining about that relatively small cost.
“When I first heard that the college was
cutting down trees for a Frisbee Golf course,
I was disappointed,” Brantley explained, “But
after walking through the course and seeing
the beauty of the woods, I changed my mind.”
Vagt said that only a few trees had to be cut
down, and emphasized that most of the work
was clearing underbrush, which “had to be
done anyways.” He hopes that the new course
will motivate many more students to go out
and enjoy DC’s forests at the back of campus.
Vagt and Brantley want the entire campus to
enjoy the course, and Brantley suggests a
tournament at Spring Frolics for the whole
community.
Incidentally, Brantley’s team won the tour-
nament averaging a birdie per hole.
