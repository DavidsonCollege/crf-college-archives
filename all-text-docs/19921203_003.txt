Exams

Continued from page 1
According to Klein, the optional
classes are “new in official capac-
ity but in years past professors had
the opportunity” to have 14 weeks
and areading week or 15 full weeks
and then exams. Klein described
the optional classes as “a compro-
mise.”

At the end of this school year
a survey will be sent out to the
faculty to see whether the optional
class days were used for classes or
as study days.

Klein emphasized that the
Executive Committee of the Fac-
ulty is “keenly aware of the objec-
tions to this year’s calendar.” The
committee is listening to all of its
constituencies, including faculty,
alumni, athletics, and especially
students. With the large numberof

offices interested in the calendar,
the committee is “very sensitive”
to the needs and desires of all of
them.

A number of students have
expressed their distaste for the new
exam schedule.

Junior Rachel Dunifon said,
“A lot of teachers are using the
optional class days to fit in the
work they haven’t had time for.
Also, I liked being able to take a
break in between exams instead of
having to take several in a row.”

David Wright, a senior, com-
mented, “It makes it really diffi-
cult for those taking five courses;
however, it is unrealistic to have
five days [for exams] regardless if
you have four exams or not. If
optional class days were used to
study that would help.”

“Optional classes are ridicu-
lous. If they are going to take out
a day of exams they need to adda

reading day,” said junior Lesley
Marshall.

Junior Robert Pascal sug-
gested, “I think they should leave
us the option to take exams on
Sunday.”

Senior Jennifer Roos said, “I
think it is very discriminatory
against athletes. We have prac-
tices and games that take away
time from exam days. In the past
we've had a week, now I have to
take them all back to back.”

Spring semester of ‘93 will
also have optional classes, a read-
ing day, and five days for exams.
The fall and spring semester exam
schedule for the school year of
‘93-*94 willimitate the same style.
This month the Executive Com-
mittee of the Faculty will finalize
the calendar for the ‘94- ‘95 aca-
demic year.

Final Four

shots. Davidson coach. Charlie
Slagle said, “They obviously gave
a lot of respect to one of the best
players in the country.”

But other Davidson players
picked up the slack, and, as usual,
goalkeeper Alex Deegan was one
of them. Early in the first overtime,
he preserved his shutout with a
most unorthodox save. Having bro-
ken the wrong way on a blast from
18 yards by State’sErwin Aguilera,

he “knuckled back” to block the
shot with his leg and detiect it out
of play.

Shots were even at 24 in the
match, and the fact that only one
goal was scored was really acredit
to the defenses of both teams. The
Pack’s attack was predicated on
passes down the wings, the idea
being that N.C. State’sspeed would
eventually prompt a mistake by
the Davidson defense. State’s Mark
Jonas and Gabriel Okonkwo each
threatened with narrowly missed
shots to the right post in the first
overtime, but the Davidson defense

never yielded, “The defense
played great the whole game
and then the offense came
through,” Deegan said.

Making the Final Four, of
course, is an astounding ac-
complishment for anon-schol-
arship team from the nation’s
smallest Division I school, a
fact not lost on Slagle. “This
team never fails toamaze me,”
he said.

“It’s not really a dream
come true,” Ukrop said, “‘be-
cause I never even dreamed
about this.”

Ask for an Apple*Macintosh*computer this holiday season and
join all of the students who've discovered that no matter what they
do, Macintosh helps them do it better and faster. That’s because
Macintosh is so easy to use. And the thousands of available software
applications work in a single, consistent way. So once you've learned
one, you're well on your way to learning them all. The advantages
of Macintosh don’t end when school does. In fact, the majority of
Fortune 1000 companies use Macintosh computers: So ask your
Apple Campus Reseller to help you choose which Macintosh to put
at the top of your holiday gift list. :

Macintosh. It’s more than a present, it’s a future.
