Davidson, however, the
traditions that made the:

Women visited only during the
designated hours; the ten

free, but the time for chapel;
ROTC and physical education
were a part of liberal
education.

With dismay we watched
these traditions fall into
desuetude one by one, but we
always sought to keep our
ideology open and

To the Editor:
There are just a few things
that I find irritating con-
the mandatory or
voluntary laundry as_ ex-
pressed in THE DAVID-
SONIAN. “‘Let’s be volun-
ta

tion to the yearbook problem. _
; Neither my face nor

name has appeared in it for
three years-I’d love to have
my money back instead. What
about that social fee we all
must pay. I didn’t attend any
of the college’s functions over
Homecoming, so may I be
reimbursed. Oh, __—ithat
-wouldn’t work. Or take away
funds from thestudent senate-
it would probably be just as ef-
fective!

And how we revere that

honor code. You are resentful
that anyone would challenge
the integrity of the Davidson
student. Students aren’t being
kicked out of school now, so
there’s no reason to believe
that students would abuse a
voluntary laundry, or any
other part of the college ry

be‘ ripped-off.
sega ll and I would
like to agree with you.

Mrs. Beaver’s skepticism
arises from 30 years ex-
perience with students, mine
from four years as a student
and worker in the laundry. I
invite anyone who reveres the
honor code to come stand with
me for a few days in the laun-
dry’s linen room. You might
be surprised at the
unimaginative ways in which
your honest fellow-students
get cheap thrills and extra
pillow cases.

Decisions concerning the
future of the laundry, then,
are not made upon intuition
and feeling. They are based on
two facts: that like other

student services, the laundry
operates in the interests of all
on a mandatory basis, and
secondly, that students are not
responsible enough to live

with a voluntary laundry.

To the Editor:

It is comforting to know that
the Physical Plant does not
fall for prank calls. Rest
assured the Davidson College
payroll money is not wasted
on a hoax. Instead of paying

It was better for fourth Lit-|
tle to have gone without basic
hygienic privileges of
civilization, than for the
Physical Plant to be troubled
with. answering trivial repair
requests. Is it effective for
students to complain?

Holiday Turkey Hastens Heartburn

I’ve always believed that
there is nothing better for a
case of the ‘Davidson blues’’
than the chance to go home for
the holidays.

Turkey dinner, lots of love
and attention, and most of all
the y and stability of
home await, so breathlessly
one counts the days. Even the
last minute work-load seems
softened by the rush of an-,
ticipation. ;

Finally the day comes;
pack, cash a check, gas up,
and hit the road—a little toc
fast at first, but in all of the ex-
citement that can’t be helped.

It sure is nice to get away
from all.that pressure. What
relief, ahother day and I’d
have flipped out.

+ Funny, but the house looks a
little smaller this time,
especially my room. Who re-
arranged this place? I didn’t

Of course there is a purpose in’

is the cost of living increase
and the Dow Jones.

Yes Dad, I’ve been con-

course it’s expensive, it’s the
name, the prestige, ... no, not
a State school, it’s just not the
same. You just don’t un-
