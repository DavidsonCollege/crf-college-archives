Hockey Declared to
Be Dangerous Sport

Hockey, as played by the colleges, is
football

more dangerous than or any
other sport is a fact that is brought out
by Joseph Stubbs, Harvard Hockey
Coach.

“A doctor is in attendance at all prac-
tices and games,” Coach Stubbs,
“and he has a most complete equipment
of medical supplies. It might be noted
that we had two very severe injuries from
skate cuts last season, both of which re-
quired prompt needle work. One of the
visiting players dislocated his shoulder
in a game, was etherized, his shoulder re-
set, and strapped up without leaving the
building. There are very few practices
or games where the doctor leaves with-
out having a call for his services. Hock-

‘ey is a dangerous gatme.’”’

they feel reasonably sure of several.
Among these are Concord, North Wilkes-
boro and Salisbury.

T ‘HE air map of America is now in the making—on

Ten years ago, there were 218 miles of air mail routes with
two station stops; to-day, a’ network of sky roads bridges
the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from
Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.

Can you imagine this growth without electricity—without
illuminated airports—without trunk lines studded with
electric beacons? -

Men of vision are building for increasing traffic of the air.
Soon, the skies will be filled with commerce.

Just as electricity is helping to conquer the air, the land,
and the sea to-day, so to-morrow it will lead to greater
accomplishments in aviation and in every human activity.
