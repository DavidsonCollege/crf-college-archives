Davidson vs. the urban sprawl

An examination of alternatice college experiences: might less be more?

By WEsLEY GOLDSBERRY
Arts & Living Editor

OSTON — Fall break often

gives Davidson students the

first opportunity since the

dawn of classes to escape
the rural confines of the Mecklenburg
County Soil and Water Conservation
District.

Many return home to frolic with
high school chums, some turn to the
beach to catch some last minute rays,
anda few brave souls take the infamous
Urban Plunge.

I myself took the civilized urban
plunge, spending three scintillating
nights in the greater Boston area, visit-
ing several friends and family mem-
bers.

Arriving at Logan Airport late
Saturday evening, I was guided by my
cousin onto a shuttle let to the nearest
subway station (or “T” stop as they are
more often called in the Hub).

Boston, at least for me, has the
remarkable ability to make itself and
the rest of the world smaller than aisle
five at Dover’s, as I raninto Davidson's
own Zhenya Arutunyan and an old
friend from high school less than a half
hour after stepping off Midway Flight
No. 5.

also passed Dan Duquette — the
oft-maligned general manager of the
Boston Red Sox — on my way across
the Charles River bridge one morning.

Boston’s public transportation

system is second to none, enabling you
to get from one end of the city to an-
other for a mere 85 cents (just be sure
you put the token through the slot be-
fore you step through the turnstile — it
hurts to attempt otherwise).

The city stands immersed in his-
tory and culture, and is host to nearly 50
different colleges and universities.

Davidson, N.C.,‘is host to one
college, the Tom Clark Museum, and
Ben’& Jerry’s. I’ve still not set foot in
the last two.

My travels first took me to Boston
University and MIT. Either one of these
schools represent the antithesis of
Davidson (academic prestige aside).

These schools have no grass —
meaning lawns — and their campuses
are virtually indistinguishable from the
rest of the city.

Dormitories are usually old hotels
or apartment buildings purchased by
the school.

Free time is usually spent out and
about, frequenting stores, clubs, muse-
ums, or simply exploring different ar-
eas of town.

I enjoyed the excitement and the
novelty of having an entire city at my
fingertips, a seemingly endless sphere
of entertainment areas, places to spend
lots of money,
mirth and intrigue.

When Tuesday morning rolled
around, I was sorry to see my vacation
end,

It made realize everything

and other sources of

Davidson is not — big, bright, exciting, -

bursting at the beams with new places to
visit and new people to be mugged by.

When I picture life at Boston Uni-
versity, I think of stepping outside my
cousin’s dorm and faces Kenmore
square and all the shops and sights
sounds therein.

When I picture life at Davidson, I
see myself listening to music — whether
it be Dave Mathews or Wesley Wills —
with friends, the sound intermingling
with laughter and students banging re-
lentlessly on the door at the end of the
hall because they have misplaced their
Cat-Card. :

People sometimes ask if we might
be missing out on the “real” college
experience by attending a school like
Davidson as opposed to a large univer-
sity.

The answer, of course, depends on
the definition of “real.”

I noticed the focal point of life at
BU, for example, seems to be the world
outside — albeit a spectacular one.

Our experience at Davidson is
based primarily upon the people we
meet, more. so than our occasional ex-
cursions to Cornelius, “The City that
Never Sleeps.”

At least for the next few years, I'll
cherish the privilege of doing living in
Davidson and my visiting in larger
realms,

After all, what is Boston's public
transportation system but a large scale
version of the Vamanos Van?

Body

Hey there! We hope you all had
a relaxing and enjoyable fall break.

This week, we received one letter
that asked us to address a couple of
questions. So we are going to give you
a breakdown.

Question: What is a dental dam
and how does it work?

Answer: Originally developed
for the dental industry, a dental dam is
a thin piece of latex that can be placed
over the female genitalia during oral
sex. It can also be used to cover the
anus during oral or anal sex.

We wanted totell youa few things
about the use of dental dams to save
you time in the heat of the moment.

First of all, you never want to use
the same dental dam more than once.

This includes switching from oral-
vaginal to oral-anal and vice-versa.

Remember to keep the same side
of the dam toward the body.

If for some reason you find your-
self without a handy dental dam, you
can always make your own with a non-
lubricated latex condom.

Simply cut an unrolled condom
down the center and open it. Voila,
your homemade dental dam!

Although you could get quite ex-
cited, it is important that you follow all
these helpful hints to ensure maximum
protection.

Sensitivity can be greatly en-
hanced by using a lubricant. However,
in this case you might not want to use
a lubricant with spermicide because it
does not taste very good.

We would not recommend it.

To apply this lovely sex aid, you
first rinse off the talc because it may
cause irritation. -It will need to dry
before use.

Then hold the dam over the vulva
or anus during oral stimulation, mak-
ing sure that it remains in place. .

Dental dams are effective in pro-
tecting you from sexually transmitted
diseases.

Oral herpes and genital herpes
are 2asily interchangeable. But if you
use a dental dam properly, you can
continue to keep yourself safe during
oral sex.

Please remember that dental dams
are used for oral-vaginal and oral-anal
intercourse only.

If you would like more explicit
directions or other information about
dental dams, please refer to: http://
www.ivygreen.gr.cc.wa.us/gender/
STDs/safesex/dental.dam.htm.

This is an important question and
we hope to see many more like it.

Remember that, on Wednesday,
the Student Health Center will be giv-
ing flu shots again. Please keep your
eyes peeled for publicity about this
event.

We would also encourage you to
have hall programs and invite us, the
Health Advisors, to talk to your hall.
We'll even bring dental dams for ev-
eryone!

We have helpful information to
share, and we are more than glad to
customize any program to fit your
needs.

Have a good week! Please ad-
dress further questions or comments to
The Student Body, c/o Mitch Shores,
P.O. Box 4180, Davidson, NC 28036.
