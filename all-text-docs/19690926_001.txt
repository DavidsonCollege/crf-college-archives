207 Freshmen _
Begin Catharsis

Amidst the awe at the‘re
juvenated freshman dormi
tories and the confusion of
class schediles, 277. frésn
men struggled through a
week of orientation before
beginning their academi
catharsis this week

Awaiting them when they
arrived was a revamped
orientation schedule, which
included a mandatory fresa

man camp other assort
ed introducti to camp
life

According to Director of
Administrations H. Edmunds
White, 20 percent of this
year’s freshmen are from
outside the South--a notable
increase over past years.
29 states and Canada are re
presented.

For the first time this fail,
the YMCA-sponsored Fresh
man Camp at Camp Thund
erbird in South Carolina was
made -mandatory. In tie
past, the camp provided an
optional opportunity to meet
other freshmen.

Criticism had mounted
however, saying that much
of orientatién in past years
overlapped what was said
and done at freshman camp,
so this year it was made an
integral part of the orien-
tation program. -

Keynote speaker at the
camp this year was 'Dr. Don
Wardlaw, professor of homi-
letics at Columbia Seminary
in Decatur, Ga. Wardlaw nad
spoken also at.dast year's
camp and at a chapel pro-
gram two years ago at
Davidson.

He spoke twice during this
year’s camp.on the theme of
“What It Means To Be a
Sexual Person,"’ stressing

the importance of a total
body and soul sexual rela
tionship

During his talks, Ward-
law critized ‘distorted sex-
ualty"’ and the image of
“the Marlboro male,”’ which

he said were false attempts
at realization of the Ameri
can dream male

Citing manliness as an ad
mirable trait, Wardlaw call
ed for more .sensitivity in
males, adhering to the phil
osophy of “loving people and
using things.”

The first week's activities
were capped off Saturday
evening--with-a—mixer—-with
Queens College. Tomorrow
evening, girls from Converse
will come for another mixer
with the Davidson freshmen.

Freshmen Majority

Joins ROTC Ranks

By DAVID SWEATT
Asseciate Editor

Over 50 percent of David-
son's néw freshmen have en-
rolled in ‘the’ Army ROTC’s
basic course.. Formerly com
pulsory, the two-year basic
course was made optional
by vote of the college's board
of trustees last May.

At the completion of re-
gistration for the ROTC
146 freshman had registered
for the ROTC program, ac-
cording to the registrar's of-
fice,

enrolled “will make a very

cerned.”

Registration followed pre

the /advantages and disad-

orientation at Camp Thund-

six officers from the ROTC

depattment, economics pro

“We had a very healthy
discussion out at camp,”
said Foster, adding ‘hat
the ROTC ‘cadre ‘‘made a
factual presentation of tie
pro's."*

Primary among the ad
vantages emphasized, ac
cording to Foster, is the pos
sibility of getting delays for
graduate school. He noted
that 92 percent of last year's
graduating seniors received
graduate delays.

Kincaid spoke on the prac

tical alternatives to ROTC
at the request of Dean of
Students Richard C. Burts
Jr. He discussed officer
programs in the other
services, possible changes
in the world situation, end

possible changes in the mili
