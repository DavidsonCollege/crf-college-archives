Begin Term’s Work

Three Issues To Be Printed
This Summer

Members of the editorial and
business staff of the Davidsonian
have begun their summer work in
helping to publish to the students
it
interest

news and feature of which, is

hoped, will be of
to them.

Members

some

staff
of

of
are as follows:

the editorial
Bruce Fisher,
Clearwater and Montreat, Associate
Editor ; Bill Whitaker, of St. Peters-
Ed Gold-
Managing

burg, Fla. Feature Editor ;
en, of Jacksonville, Fla.,
Editor Harry McLean, of Plymouth,
Bob
Hollinger, of Gastonia, Managing
Editor; Philip Whittier, of Atlanta,
Ga., Managing Editor; Joe Stukes,

and David Farro, of Charlotte,

Members of. the business staff
are as follows: Ward Lasley, of
Burlington, Assistant Jusiness
Manager; Bob Gambrell, of Atlanta,
Ga., Advertising Manager; Margic
Vickers, of Charlotte, Assistant
Advertising Manager; and Bob
Smoak, of Wilkesboro, Circulation
Manager.

Interesting articles appearing in
each issue should be noted and
read with attention. Ed Golden’s
column “Think On These Things”
is a very interesting and inspiring
article concerning the religious
scope about the campus. One’s time
would never be wasted reading such
an article as that. Falling back upon
previous copies of the Davidsonian
the (summer issues will carry a
column by Buddy Wells, publicity
agent of the YMCA, concering hap-
penings in which the YMCA is in-
volved. The work of the cabinet,
and the social life of the student
body for the summer will be stress-
ed most. Another article which
many students seem to overlook,
but which in no wise shouldn’t be
missed, is the newly installed music
column by Bob Hollinger. The work
of Phi Mu Alpha will be included
here along with other interesting
music items.
“fifth” column will be of interest
to everyone, and will provide fun
and frolic for all. It is not the
desire of the editorial staff to of-
fend or hurt anyone in this article,
and actions against such will be
taken, Finally, let us not overlook
the editorials. In a sense the edi-
torials are the most important
articles in the paper, or in them
is expressed the feelings of the
student body as a whole. So be-
fore you lay your paper aside, turn
to the editorials, read them, and see
if you don’t gain something from
them.

The majority of the news which
you read on, the front page is made
possible by the help 6f the alumni
office. Permit us to take this op-
portunity here to express our
thanks to Mr. John Payne for his
most helpful work in furnishing
many of the articles you read thro-
ughout the Davidsonian. Without
the help of Mr. Payne, the news
you would see in the Davidsonian
would be sadly reduced. And so, to
‘Mr. Payne, we express our Ge eessh
gratification.

The business staff of the paper
must not be overlooked. It is the
work of the business staff to help
make the Davidsonian possible by
securing the advertsements for the
paper, which you see adorning the
back page.

It is sincerely hoped by the mem-

Advertising Manager; and

bers. of the editorial and 'business-

staff that the summer issues of the
Davidsonian will be the best war
issues ever sent to press, and only by
the cooperation of the members of
the editorial and business staff and
the students of Davidson College can
this be made possible.

It is hoped that the |}

“Think On
These Things”

By Ed Golden

During the last semester of last
year a column titled “Think On
These Things” was written for the
specific purpose of trying to sum
up the religious activities on our
campus, This summer, as last
spring, the column will continue to
be written for that purpose. So,
when you read this column think
seriously and sincerely on these
things.

Last Sunday Evening at our first
vesper service the new students
were introduced to the Dividson
College Pastor, Dr. Carl R. Pritch-
ett. I would like to repeat a re-
mark made in Chapel by Jim Rob-
inson that if a student goes through
Davidson without having a heart
to heart talk with Dr. Pritchett, he
will certainly have missed a wonder-
ful experience. So, if any of the
new students have any problems
that they would like to talk with
someone, I want to strongly advise
that you to go talk them over with
Dr. Pritchett. To continue with
Dr. Pritchett’s vesper sermon, he
spoke of the fact that many stu-
dents come to college with an in-
herited faith and when we face our
problems we are overcome with awe
by the sheer lack Of knowledge con-
cerning our religious beliefs. Con-
sequently we should try to analysis
our’ religious _ beliefs and
cordinally. The greatest thing in
life is being a Christian; our pro-
fessions, our avocations are inciden-
tal compared to being a Christ-
ian. If it is the greatest single thing
in our lives, should we pay less
attention to it than to our other
interest. When a person comes to
college he begins to stand upon
his own feet for a change, and be- .
gins to make his own decisions and
investments. Therefor it
tremely important that we begin
upon the right foot and put our best
foot forward. The only satisfactory
way to do this is to invade the
Kingdom of God, and captivate it for.
our own lives, and live as Christ
would have us live. We must, first
of all as Christians, then as men
of Davidson, learn to live as those
who passed through these portals
and have made Davidson what it is
today. We must not let them down!

Last Thursday the Y.M.C.A. had
its presentation in Chapel of its
council and their respective work
and aims. By now many of you have
come to realize that the dominant
force on the campus is’ the “Y”,
It has a serious and large responsi-
bility in trying to)make the “Y” the
influence it must and should have
on the campus. The work of the
“y” is greater than any of us can
imagine. It reaches out into fields
many of us are not familiar with,
but this work can not go on with-
out your help. Many Sunday School
teachers are needed to -help in the
work of cheering and _ bringing
spiritual encouragement to the sick
at the Mecklenburg Sanatorium,
Many of us have never taught.
Sunday School, but let that not

act ac-

is @x-

‘hinder you. We can overcome such

insignificant alibies by taking a
a, class and seeing how the people
respond to the faith and attention
the teacher shows. Also, many fel-
lows are needed to help in the much
needed scout work. At one time, the
work was continuing nicely, but the
exodus of many of the upperclass-
men left a large hiatus in the scout
as well as in the other work of “Y”
and College. Many fellows are
needed who have a little initiative
who will never cease till the work is
completed and done well, Won't
you help, by giving what little time
and encouragement you can to this
much needed work, Always. take
advantage to do something to help
others and the College whenever you
can, and this is one time there is so
much to do and so. little to help.
Think on These Things.
