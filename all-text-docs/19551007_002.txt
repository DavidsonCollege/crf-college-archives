The Latest On
Subsidization

Subsidization of athletics has tong been o
problem in American colleges and universities.
it reached a focal point jas? year at Davidson
among students, alumni, and administration. The
problem was aired, letters written, opinions
expressed, and decisions reached. The editors
are relinquishing their columns this week to

present this final recapitulation end revela.

tlon of letters and actions which took place up
through the summer of 1955 es explained in
the Davidson College Bulletin and letters to
the President of the Student Body.

In the spring of 1954 a joint commit-
tee of five Trustees and five faculty mem-
bers made a long and thorough study of
Davidson's intercollegiate athletic policy.
Representing the Trustees were Mr. J.
Harold McKeithen, Chairman, Dr. Kelsey
Regen, Mr. J. P. Booth, Dr. C. Grier Da-
vis, Mr. George Crouch. Representing the
Faculty were Dr. Frontis W. Johnston,
Dr. William G. McGavock, Professor John
T. Kimbrough, Dr. J. W. Reid and Dr. W.
O. Puckett.

Their report to the Trustees in May,
1954, which was unanimously adopted
looked first to the clear definition of the
present policy. It also set forth the terms
of a “proposed athletic policy.” The es-
sence of this policy was embodied in the
following recommendation:

“We recommend to the Trustees that
they authorize the President of the Col-
lege to solicit and encourage a selected
group of at least six colleges and univer-
sities to join with us in promoting a pro-
gram looking toward the abolishing of
subsidized athletics (that is. athletic
scholarships as such) at the earliest pos-
sible date.

In order that the President of the Col-
lege may understand the degree of au-
thority given him under this recommen-
dation we would agree that the principles
adopted by the Ivy group indicate the
general type of agreement to be desired.”

During the school year 1954-55, Presi-
dent Cunningham gave attention to this
directive from the Trustees. Numerous
conferences were held with the Presidents
of colleges within the Southern Confer-
ence and with others from institutions of
congenial type. It was during this period
that Washington and Lee indicated the
action of its Trustees dropping subsidized
athletics.

Conferences with the Presidents of the
institutions revealed by and large a deep
sympathy with the whole ideal of non-
subsidized athletics. Circumstances, local
and immediate, with which some of the
institutions were confronted seemed to
prevent any immediate action. In response
to a communication from the students to
the Trustees in May, 1955, urging that
subsidized athletics be continued at David-
son, the Trustees replied (in part) as fol-
lows:

“The Trustees and Faculty have taken
action expressing the hope that the time
will come when it will be possible to have
all athletic sports maintained on an unsub-
sidized basis. It was in the days of unsub-
sidized athletics that Davidson’s greatest
victories were achieved and that the fight-
ing spirit of our teams was mostly widely
known and applauded. We believe that the
return of that type of competition to the
campuses of America is greatly to be de-
sired and for that reason have asked the
President of the College to initiate con-
ference on this subject with representa-
tives of other institutions of similar stand-
ing and ideals.”

“It is not the intention of the Trustees
or Administration that the proposed new
policy shall be instituted unless and until
we can enlist the cooperation of a solid
nucleus of schools from within the ranks
of the present Southern Conference and

other natural rivals of Davidson.”

“In the meantime the present ath-
letic policy of Davidson remains unchang-
ed. The details of that plan have recent-
ly been published in The Davidsonian and
need no explanation here .. . We believe
that the issues have now been sufficiently
discussed to be understood by all and that
the best interest of the College cannot be
served by further agitation of the matter
at this time. We would invite all parties
concerned to give their support to the
ideal of unsubsidized athletics as our ulti-
mate goal. Until that goal can be realized,
we ask the support of’all for our present
policy which we believe to be thoroughly
honorable and reasonably satisfactory un-
der existing circumstances.”

“The action of the Trustees is in no
sense to be understood as a reflection
upon the splendid group of athletes now
representing the College. We are proud
of these men as athletes but feel an even
preater sense of pride in the fact that al-
most without exception they have proven
themselves to be capable students and
worthy men. We acknowledge with grati-
tude the large contribution which they
have made to the life of our campus dur-
ing the past year. It is our desire and pur-
pose that. if and when a program of un-
subsidized athletics is launched, it will
still be possible for such men to have fi-
nancial aid in order to attend Davidson.
Such aid would then be given upon con-
Siderations of need, of ability, and of
character alone, and the athlete would be
eligible for it upon the same basis as other
students. No man, however, would be re-
quired to engage in an athletic sport or
sports in order to retain his scholarship.”

During the summer President Cun-
ningham wrote the Trustees and Faculty:

‘As I now see the situation there is no
early prospect of our effecting a schedule
of congenial colleges to meet the condi-
tions of our proposed plan for the Future
. .. The desirability of such a plan is
convincing to almost all of our Faculty
and to me personally. The sentiment in
the educational worid is strongly in favor
of a marked decrease in subsidized ath-
letics. Phi Beta Kappa according to its
recent action after three or four years
consideration will require a strong meas-
ure of de-emphasis on the part of colleges
which will be allowed membership in the
future. It is my judgment and my pro-
posal that until there is some change in
the existing conditions among our sister
institutions, we rest the efforts which you
have asked me to make—I certainly do
not desire to have a continuation of the
agitation of the question with its attendant
misunderstanding among students and
alumni. (I have sent a note to the presi-
dents of the colleges with whom we have
conferred indicating Davidson’s position
and her readiness to reopen the matter if
and when a sufficient number of institu-
tions should desire.)”

In commenting on the above, Presi-
dent Cunningham stated: “I continue to
have serious misgivings about Davidson's
future and the present policy. I do not
know of a smal! Church-refated liberal
arts college of Davidson’s type which is
investing as much money annually upon
a single intercollegiate sport as we are
spending on football. Furthermore, the
matter of a schedule for the future is in-
creasingly problematical. The lines are
being more severely drawn, some col-
leges moving to heavier subsidizing and
an increasing number moving to non-sub-
sidization. Before many years I predict it
will be necessary for Davidson to take
her stand on one side of the line or the
other. Increasingly, as I have watched the
situation in Davidson and in American
colleges in general I am persuaded that
there is no permanent middle of the road
course.”

This is the latest and last word on sub-
sidization by members of the Board of
Trustees and administration. Thus athletic
subsidization continues to be an unsettled
problem here at Davidson. Its solution de-
mands careful and objective consideration
and the time of another year.

Speak Louder Than Words

(The Davidsonian, in conjunc-
tion with the International Rela-

tions Club, is beginning this week

a series of bi-weekly articles con-
cerned with issues from beyond the
campus perimeter, in an effort to
stimulate and encourage interest
and discussion among Davidsonians
in National and International af-
fairs. The writers of this series are
by no means experts in this field,
but are alert. and vitally interested
in these global issues.—Ed.)

In the seven weeks since the
meeting of Geneva at the summit
a profound and universal wave of
hope has filled the hearts of mil-
lions. The “Spirit of Geneva” is a
wholesome thing in itself but it
conceals a grave danger. The dan-
ger is a growing tendency, both
here and abroad to believe that
peace has already been achieved.
To mistake atmosphere for  ac-
complishment is not only an error:
it is apt to make more difficult a
genuine peace. The real test for
that will come on October 27. at a
new Geneva, when the foreign min-
isters of the Big Four sit down to
see if they cam reach any agree-
ment at all on the major problems
which still divide them. Now there
is even more to fear since the
health of the President of the Unit-
ed States has become a matter of
vital concern. What effect will his
probable incapacity to run for re-
election have on the parley? This
adds more to the complications al-
ready at hand.

Until there {fs assurance that the

* Soviets are will-
ing to make gen-
uine concessions
on these prob-
lems it-is a fol-
ly and a mock-
ery to build our
hopes too high.
1 If there is any
public vice
greater than un-
justified pessim-
ism it is that of
false optimism. For when it reach-
es a frenzy it may take fantastic
forms.

A few weeks ago Vladimir Mat-
skevich invited some four hundred
guests to a caviar-champagne par-

ty. Many prominent diplomats of
the West joined in sipping cham.
pagne and greeting the smiling
Communist as he stood beneath a
huge unsmiling portrait of Josef
Stalin.

There is no harm in this kind of
fellowship and it can do good so
long as it is recognized for what
it is — just geniality and nothing
more. The American farm experts
visiting the Soviet Union had much
the same sort of experience, and
came back feeling that the trip
helped each side get a better un.
derstanding of the other's peoples.
Naturally, we are for that, and
more of it. But one hardly expects
to find some members of the Na-
tional Press Club applauding Mat-
skevich when he told it “the peo-
ple are the boss in Russia.” Much
less can one understand the sort
of behavior displayed by Louisi-
ana’s Senator Ellender in his cur-
rent visit to Moscow. At a time
when millions of people in satellite
nations are still enslaved by a
Soviet-enforced Communist rule,
Ellender went to a banquet at the
puppet Romanian embassy to join

the Politboro in toasting the elev- -

enth anniversary of Romania's “lib-
eration,” which was in reality the
Soviet occupation.

If anyone doubts that this kind
of speculation can be dangerous,
consider what has already happen-
ed. Even level-headed people, and
some of them in high-level places,
are forgetting that it is only be-
cause the free world has grown
strong that the Communists are
talking more gently. Yet, though
strength is what brought results,
some people are now foolish enough
to believe that the “Spirit of Ge-
neva” justifies reducing this
strength. Even the administration
is talking of cutting the defense
budget, and many able senators are
asking for tax reductions. And
NATO nations are talking of scal-
ing down their arms plans.

The Western peoples’ uncritical
acceptance of the seven months’ re-
sults of Geneva has dismayed the
captive peoples who, looking at
photos of East-West friendliness at
Bulganin’s country picnic, assume
‘that the West is buying a peace on

Russian terms. We must be remind-
ed that while Russia holds the olive
leaf in one hand, she holds the
dagger in the other. Russia has
maintained Communist subversives
in free nations, continued the di-
vision of Germany as a major
threat to Europe's peace, continued
Soviet military occupation of other
nations despite peace treaties which
promised to end it. We don't have
to end the friendliness spirit but
we shouldn’t be blinded by its glit-
ter,

The free world must meet every
honest step the Russians prove will-
ing to take to establish a peace
which must be not only genuine
but just. In order to open the road
to such a peace, the division of
Germany must be ended, and free
elections permitted. If this were
permitted, the United States could
guarantee Russia’s security needs
by an unqualified commitment to
fight any renewed German aggres-
sion.

Perhaps the most important task
is the question of disarming enough
to remove the danger that either
side might stumble into war through
blind fear. A test of Russia’s sin-
cerity will be her final answer to
Eisenhower's proposal of mutual
aerial inspection.

Finally, the question of ending
an occupation of Eastern Europe
which can no longer be justified on
security grounds, especially if
Europe's own security is guaran-
teed by joint U. S.-Soviet under-
writing. It is perhaps hopeless to
think that this will occur  over-
night; but if the Soviets will re-
move the troops that keep them in
power, the people themselves may
be able to express their own wills.

If progress can be made upon
these issues, the U. S. and Russia
could then become travelers on
the same plane on a flight to
peace: however, until we get this
sort of result, it is foolish to re-
gard the “Geneva Spirit” as any-
thing more than a token of what
Russia will offer in the way of
world peace. The results which
must come out of Geneva, in order
to maintain a just peace, are con-
crete proposals which will be acted
upon by Russia immediately.

The New Voluntary YMCA...A
Challenge to Everyone Involved

The_Y.M.C.A. has launched forth
into another year of activity under
a new flag, the flag of voluntary
participation. Let us not assume
that the parousia has arrived be-
cause we are no longer members
because we are made to join. The
voluntary Y will be beset by many
problems and. is in danger of
plunging into many pitfalls. We
shall suffer from many growing
pains and many shrinking pangs.

This article is designed to inform
you what the General Secretary be-
lieves to be the message of the Y
forthe Davidson Campus, and how
this message can be. expounded
through the various channels
which the Y has at its disposal.

The association must primarily
seek to go be- fie,
yond a mere en-
deavor to be an -
organization
which is accept- (F.
ed 1s a contin. ©
ued “good
thing” to. have
on campus, be-
cause we are a
Christian Col- _
lege, or to pro-
oagate a Chris- Will Terry
tian ethic, but to create an atmos-
phere which allows its members
to penetrate religious superficiali-
ty toward an allegiance to Jesus
Christ which is stronger than life
itself. If our tasks carry us into
unpopular areas, into them we shall
go if we believe they are our
tasks.

This commitment to Christ can
only be developed in the individual
but the Y can stimulate the de-
sire and antagonize the individual
to begin the intellectual and spirit-
ual struggle toward the goal of
Christian surrender and disciple-
ship. Some of the channels which
we hope can create such an atmos-
phere are those groups concerned
with the campus’ spiritual enrich-
ment. This can be one of the most
important parts of our message, if
the leaders of this group and the
participants in it recognize the
scope it.can entail and approach
this adventure with reverance and

good sense. From furidamentalist
pietism and irresponsible emo-
tionalism, Good Lord deliver us!
Yet in avoiding this let us not slip
into a cold and indifferent attitude
toward communion with God.

There must be an initial com-
mitment to Jesus Christ as the
Lord of our lives. Yet our Chris-
tian commitment must not stop at
the “mourner’s bench” for if we
allow our lives to cease to develop
beyond this we are but embryos
and our place in the Kingdom is as
the. “still born” infant. Our Chris-
tian dedication must extend to the
community in which we live. The
Christian life is more than life as
an individual, separated from all
else, it is a life of sharing. Through
this sharing we acquire a theologi-
cal perspective (which is as im-
portant for the layman as the min-
ister) and develop convictions. We
shall gain clarity, direction, and
support as we as a group enrich
our common and individual life.

Another part of the Y's message
is that of Christian vocation. One
of the cardinal doctrines of Protes-
tant Christianity is “the high call-
ing of God in Christ Jesus.” All
men are called of God to be preach-
ers of the gospel. It is our primary
function in life. “What does it
profit a man if he gain the whole
world and lose his own soul?”
Much of our education is spent in
preparing us for our chosen life’s
work. Few of us give much time for
the developing of Christian growth.
The ignorance of the average man
of the Bible and of his heritage as
a Protestant is deplorable. A doc-
tor is expected to know his medi-
cine, a business man his business;
he sees to it that he knows what is
expected of him, however, when he
is questioned concerning his faith
he states it makes no difference
what a man believes as long as he
is “good.” His tolerance is based
on ignorance and laziness. It makes
quite a great deal of difference
what a man believes and even a
great deal more difference why he
believes it. Thomas Jefferson in his
Bill for Religious Freedom stated
that mere toleration was a lazy

man’s creed which made him indif-
ferent. Within the framework of
the Y we should find a channel
which contributes to our education
as Churchmen in the Church of
Jesus Christ, so that all of the
works of our hands and minds be
as unto God.

Thus far we have considered the
fortification of ourselves as Chris-
tlans. To be always taking and
never putting out makes for an
obese faith, hence Christian out-
reach is a vital part of our mes-
sage. We, who embrace the Chris-
tian faith, must be evangelist as
surely as Templeton, Sheen, and
Graham. There must be an imper-
ative drive from within that must
make us concerned for the faith
of our roommate, team mate, and
fab partner. This is not to imply
that the Y proposes to establish a
squad of button hole gospel sales-
men. On the other hand, this cam-
pus saw a fellow student last year
who became concerned with the
destiny of Davidsonians, his work
is still evident and shall be for
Many years to come. There are
channels within the Y which ex-
tends our outreach beyond the
campus to the surrounding area.
Through these channels the life of
this area has been enriched.

The social demands of the Gos-
pel as expressed by the Y are also
an important part of our Christian
outreach. When we begin to ques-
tion and to cause others to question
what Christ’s Gospel has to say
about political, economic, and social
practices of secular society then
we have begun to develop a socie-
ty with a conscience, and have
sown the seeds for the developing
of a Christian conscience.

It is our hope that the members
of the Y will regard their affiliation
with this body as more than a
member of another organization,
but you are part of an arm of the
Church. Christian life can not be
lived in a vacuum; it is our hope
that through fellowship i.e. mutual
help, study, work, and worship we
may grow in Christian wisdom and
stature.

QUESTION:

Since such a sizeable number of
students solidiy prefer to study in
their dorm rooms rather than in
the library, why is it impossible
for reserve books to be taken from
the library during the day? Certain-
ly the same time limits could be
enforced, and the same fines im-
posed together with appropriste
penalties if the book were damag-
ed as @ result of its being taken
from the library. For many stu-
dents who prefer not to study in
the library, & program to allow
them to take reserve books out of
the library would be a distinct ser-
vice.

Secondly, why, if reserve books
can be checked out for the weekend
on Saturday at four P. M., is it im-
possible to check them out before
the same hour on Sunday?

inconvenience to students Is the
obvious result of these two regula-
tions. ‘Could they possibly be
amended?

ANSWER;

The reasons for having Reserve
Books read in the building are for
the purpose of having these books
as available as possible to the stu-
dents. It is our business, in the
library, to have the book you want
when you want it as far as this is
possible. We havé over eight hun-
dred students to consider. The fol-
lowing should be given considera-
tion before any change in this par-
ticular rule is made:

(1) Say there are five copies of a
Reserve Book and twenty men in
the class. Each of the twenty must
have a chance at the books. If the
men who are using the books are
in the building, a student who
wants a turn has only to ask the
Desk Man who has them. He can
then find the men who are using
the books and ask when the user
will return the book to the desk.
He does not have to walk to the
Library and then back to the
dorms.

(2) It is human nature to put off
making a trip to the library if pos-
sible. Assume that the rule is
changed and Reserve Books may
be taken to the dorms. Is it likely
that the users will bring them back
as soon as they are through with
them—or wait until a convenient
time an hour or two later? When
a student is using a book in the
building, the path of least resis-
tance (the one most of us take) is
to return it to the desk as he leaves.
Reserve Books are selected and
put on Reserve by the members of
the Faculty. Only they are com-
petent to tell the time needed and
the importance of each book. For
that reason, only Faculty members
can give special permission with
Tespect to taking a Reserve Book
out earlier than the hours stated
or otherwise change the regula-
tions.

This, rule is made for the con-
venience of the largest number. If
students know of college or uni-
versity libraries which have a
more convenient system, we will be
glad to get the names and write to
them for information. We aim to
please — eight hundred and seven-
ty of you.

With respect to the rule regard-
ing charging out Reserve Books be-
fore four P. M. on Sundays, the
original idea was that most copies
would go out Saturday night for

noon for those who preferred to
Study in the library. As far as we
can tell, this has worked out in
practice. But we will be glad to
change this if a representative
group of responsible students (say
the Student Council or 0.D.K. mem-
bers) will so advise us.
These replies constitute our best
judgment.

QUESTION:

in connection with the program
of the Y.M.C.A., does the Y in-
tend to use the information on the
yellow cards which were filled out
by the students who joined?

ANSWER:

Yes, the Y.M.C.A. definitely in-
tends to follow through with the
integration of students in the ca-
pacities for which they volunteer-
ed. The Y is in the process of tab-
ulating the yellow cards now, and
is assigning to each chairman the
men who have shown interest in
his particular field. This tabula-
tion may take several weeks, but
at the end of this short period of
filing, all students who so wish will
be integrated into the program of -
the Y. It is the wish of the Y that
each student who joined will par-
ticipate actively in its program.

QUESTION:

In a letter to the editor publish.
ed in the Davidsonien last Friday,
there was 8 question raised con-
corning the operation of the Stu.
dent Union snack bar: “ . . . why
... is there only one fone man be-
hind the counter on Sunday eve-
nings when the student body en
masse charges the milk bar .. .?
In reply to this question, the em-
ployees of the snack bar have writ.
ten the fallowing stetement.

ANSWER:

In a letter to the editor in Jast
week's Davidsonien, one writer who
signed his piece with the initials
‘T.D.S.’ manifested a profound con-
cern over the state of the College
Union. .

T.D.S., while he enumerated the
substantial improvements in the
operation of the Union, apparently
had difficulty in discerning any
shortcomings in the present Union
administration. He did, however,
find ‘one slight oversight.’ There
has been one lone man behind the
snack bar counter when on Sunday
evenings there is a rush of stu-
dents to the counter. One or two
additional helpers would ease the
situation.

The truth is that the Manager of
the College Union Services hus
tried to secure extra helpers for
the Sunday evening shift. But the
poor hired help who have worked
off and on all during the week
fee) that Sunday should be their
day of rest, and they have been
reluctant to work the Sunday shift.

T.D.S., in your concern for the
State of the Union, would you not
volunteer your services to the
snack bar? In the interest of your .

fellow students, the hired help,

and the State of the Union for
which you are so solicitous, you
might alleviate the plight of the
lone man behind the counter.
The challenge, T.D.S., is yours.
Respectfully,
“The Hired Hends”

Davidson’s Official Athletic
Policy Clarified for Record

@. What is Davidson's athletic
acholarship policy?

A. The college administers an
intercollegiate athletic scholarship
program from funds provided by
the Wildcat Club. Applicants for
scholarships must be acceptable to
the faculty admissions committee.

Q. What determines the amount
allocated for athletic scholarships?

A. The amount contributed by
the Wildcat Club is used for ath-
letic scholarships. In 1950 the
Board of Trustees authorized the
college to spend, that year, a sum
of $35,000 for such scholarships.
The following amounts have since
been raised: $27,391.49 (1950),
$24,322.11 (1951), $26,463.70 (1952),
$26,549.45 (1953) and $32,410.24
(1954).

Q. How does Davidson’s policy
compere with the policies of other
members of the Southern Confer.
ence?

A. The Southern Conference is

composed of West Virginia, V.P.L,
V.M.L, George Washington, Rich-
mand, William & Mary, Furman,
The Citadel, Washington & Lee and
Davidson. Davidson's student body
is the smallest. Some of these in-
stitutions are spending double, ev-
en triple and quadruple what Da-
vidson spends for athletic scholar-
ships. Only Washington & Lee,
within the conference, has under-
taken a program allowing no ath-
letic scholarships as such.

Q. Could Davidson alumni reise
more money and increase athietic
scholarships?

A. It is doubtful that the amount
could be substantially increased,
and certainly not as high as the
average spent within the confer-
ence. The amounts of the past five
years have come after hard work,
including personal solicitation, by
several alumni interested in pro-
moting ao strong athletic program.
