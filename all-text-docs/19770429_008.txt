Approximately 300 people,
including at least 20 faculty
members, boycotted last

week’s Spring Awards Con-
vocation.

Five faculty members and
four students spoke at the
hour-long gathering, held in
front of Chambers building.

The speeches centered on
the college’s Christian Tenure
Policy and the implications of
that policy in the Linden case.
Professor of Religion Alexan-
der McKelway, Jr., was the
first faculty member to add-
ress the boycotters.

“TI am here this morning
because I value Davidson's
heritage as a church-related
college and its identity as an
institution of Christian learn-
ing. I am also here because I
believe that this heritage and
identity is threatened by a
policy of total exclusion of
non-Christian faculty.

“Almost five years ago the
faculty petitioned the Trustees
to change. their by-laws to
-allow for some non-Christians
faculty to attain tenure, After
much debate and struggle this
change was achieved, and the
present Trustee By-Law
states that “‘the Trustees may
in special circumstances grant
tenure to a person who re-
spects the Christian tradition
without commitment to all its
tenets.

‘That change was made
three years ago, and yet, since
that time, the administration
has not been willing to sus-
pend the religious requirement
in a single case and has
repeatedly excluded candi-
dates for teaching positions on
the basis of their religious

identity.

“Thus, one cannot avoid the
conclusion that neither the
administration nor the Trus-
tees intend to honor or act
upon the liberalization of reli-
gious requirement for tenure
that they agreed to in 1974.

“‘For those of us who care
about Davidson’s Christian
commitment this refusal to

identity by anti and pre- |

judicial exclusion simply con-
fesses its lack of faith in the
freedom of Christ and the
security of God. :

“For this reason the present
policy of the administration is
also dangerous. The present
policy does not secure’ our
faith and commitment, but in
a fundamental way denies it
and undercuts it. The manifest
unreasonableness and _ injus-
tice of the administration of
this policy injures our reputa-
tion as a college, places us in
legal jeopardy, and may there-
fore convince many that the
only solution is an abandon-
ment of our Christian identity.
And that is the greatest
danger.

"son,

“First, “I think we did

extend an rote te Ron Linden

with the full understanding
that he was a non-Christian.
And T think there’s a limit to
how much we can expect him

_ to support a religious tenure

policy that implies that he
should be something other
than he is.

- “Consequently, if we exten-
ded the invitation to him, as a
non-Christian, I do not ‘think
we are entitled to withdraw it
for that reason.

“On the broader issue of the
principle, I- would love to see

- Davidson become a viable

Christian community. It is my
understanding that the way
the Lord works through his

it is my understanding that the way the
Lord works through his community is by
drawing people to him through the power
of his love and not by drawing lines
around and saying ‘We dont let people
in who. are not already followers of
Christ before they come in.’ And it seems
to me that that’s what we really end up
doing, if we maintain this policy.’

Professor of Political Science Pat Edmondson

“If Davidson finally gives
up its church relationship, it
will not be because there are
non-Christians on the faculty,
but because a stubborn resis-

‘tance brings us to the point

where we have to choose
between being a religious en-
clave or an institution of

“But this is unnecessary. A
faculty generally, (even over-
whelmingly) committed to the
Christian faith can be achieved
without the present policy of

_ exclusion. And I therefore call

upon the President.

“1) To move immediately to
open some faculty positions to
non-Christians.

‘this refusal to admit non-Christians to the
tenured ranks of the faculty is both tragic

and dangerous. It is tragic because it

admit non-Christians to the
tenured ranks of the faculty is
both tragic and dangerous. It
is tragic because it contradicts
the very faith it would defend.
It is precisely ina Christian
college that one ought to find
an openness and cordiality to
instruction from a non-Christ-
ian perspective.

“The Christian man is not
called to a life of pious
isolation, nor is the church,
nor is an institution which
identifies itself with the Chris-

“tin ‘raivu. An institution
which tries to secure its own

for the interviewing and hiring
of faculty which will avoid the

needless embarrassment of the

present situation.
“8) To reopen negotiations

an agreement can be reached
which would allow him to
teach at Davidson.”

since accepted a position at
the University of Pittsburg.)

community is by drawing
people to him through the
power of his love and not by
drawing lines around and say-
ing ‘We don’t let people in who
are not already followers of

Christ before they come in.’
“‘And it seems to me that

that’s really what we end up
doing, if we maintain this
policy. For that reason, I'd
like to see barriers lowered.”
Mark Rabil read a prepared

statement which had been;

drawn up by the leaders of the
boycott and distributed the
preceding evening. The state-
ment explained the major
facts of the Linden case.

The statement closes:
“Therefore, as a protest to the
irresponsible and unethical ac-
tions of the college administ-
ration we strongly urge stu-
dents and faculty to boycott
Convocation.

“By uniting in this common
goal students and faculty will
maintain the spirit of Convo-
cation and assume that moral
leadership which the admini-
stration has rejected.”

Professor of Religion R.
David Kaylor said he was torn
between attending or boycot-
ting the Convocation.

| “I believe in what is symbo-
lized by the occasion inside...
(but) I also support that which
is symbolized by what you are
doing here, and my conscience
tells me I should support that
in which I believe.

“To me what is symbolized
out here is an openness which
rejects a closemindedness born
out of yesterday’s perceptions:

»—a freedom, af,thoncht ee

‘firmed in Davidson’s State-

ty address

ment of Purpose, that it would -

set no limits to the adventures
of the-mind in the pursuit of
truth;

—a faith that affirms the
humanity of every person
rather than a feer that rejects
those whose integrity prevents
their subscription to our
creeds;

—an affirmation of the State-
ment of Purpose concerning
the liberation of mankind
physically, mentally and spir-
itually;

—a reject on of the notion that
Davidson’s self-understanding
in terms of its Christian
purpose necessitates a narrow
sectarianism expressed
through restrictive clauses;
—an affirmation that David-
son’s own Statement fof Pur-
pose demands the removal of
policy that does not express
but rather contradicts the
heart of that stated purpose.”

Kaylor also opposes Christ-
ian tenure.

“That restrictive clause dis-
tinguishes Davidson not only
from secular institutions but
also from every other Presby-
terian-related-college I-know
of.

“It is an embarrassment
from both an academic and a
theological standpoint; it
gives rise to injustice and mis-
understanding; it does not
insure that Davidson is more
‘Christian’ than other Presby-
terian colleges, but rather
shows an unwillingness to
change a policy which is
anachronistic and which has
become in our situation moral-
ly repugnant, at least to many
of us who take Davidson's
commitment seriously. For
these and other reasons I will
continue to work for a change
of policy.”

He encouraged those who
attended the. boycott. saying,
“T hope you will continue what
you have begun, in ways that
will lead to positive change.”

Professor of Philosophy.
Earl MacCormac, who has
continually supported efforts
to change the Christian Ten-
ure Policy, spoke next.

“What I'd like to talk to you

“To pursue the truth, one
must have a free atmosphere.
One must be able to debate
various points of view. This
means conflicting ideas.

‘John Stuart. Mill said in
his famous essay ‘On Liberty’:
‘If all mankind, minus one,
were of one opinion, they
would be no more justified in
silencing that one opinion than
_he would be justified if he had
the power to silence mankind.’

“It seems to me that in a
college or university, this is’
one of the precious places in
society where you can have

_ some degree of objectivity in

order to pursue the truth.
Various opinions can be

heard—no restraints should be
put upon professors or stu-
dents upon their beliefs or
convictions.

‘Sincerity and honesty
should be reinforced, stressed,
and valued. In a situation in
which a man’s employment is
jeopardized by his religious
beliefs, or his political beliefs,
academic freedom is not_pos-
sible. The purpose of tenure is
to protect the right of the
professor and the right of the
student to pursue the truth
and to speak their minds.
“Now what does this have to

Mo with a church-related col-
lege? How can we be church-

related and still pursue the

’ truth without encumbrance?

1 want Davidson College to be a Christian institution
in the sense that academic freedom is genuinely
possible: that ideas can be pursued wherever they

lead, that the Church has a presence here , but not
@ presence that inhibits the truth and ine education

about is the nature of a college
and a church-related college.
One of the great confusions
over the sixteen years that
I’ve been here at Davidson has
been between what is a
church-related college and
what is a church.

“It seems to me that there
are two purposes for a college
or university; they’re very
simple, we all know them. One

is the pursuit of the truth. and .

the other is the education of

‘It seems to me that the
church has the responsibility
of providing an atmosphere
where free injury is possible.
It has the responsibility of

department, it can-do so in the
chapel, and it can do so in the
