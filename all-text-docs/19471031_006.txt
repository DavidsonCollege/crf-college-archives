way up, or any successful vo
ing apparel.

A careful glance at the mni-
versity man’s jacket for Fall
campus wear sees these three
obvious facts: first. that it's a
cuiet. small patterned tweed;
second, that it hangs straight
down and has little. if: any.
padding in the naturg] shoul-
ders: and third, that its a
single - breasted three - button
model. In contrast to the clar-
ion-call patterns of jacket fab-
rics of former years, the new
Fall versions are quite mild
but far from meek. There's
plenty of character in those
newer shades of brown. tan
and blue, and the blue-grey
just arriving on the campus
is going to have quite a few
fast friends.

Neckwear is in for a change of pace too, And one type
that hasn't been around for quite a while and will decorate
the necklines of the undergraduate body is the crocheted tie.

ish texture of crochet ties makes them naturals for wear with

tweeds. They knot up nicely t
bit on the Jarge side.

One compromise with the university man’s instinctive-lik-
ing for color in his apparel seems to have centered around

his-ankles. Wool Argyle plaid
socks. the campus favorite as
far back as any alumnus wishes
to recall, is in stronger than
ever for Fall. and they re quite
sensible with plain colored
slacks. Since most men prefer
grey flannels. socks made of
brown wool with blue and red
diamonds are a good het. And
for variety, grey, black and
red make an excellent auxili-
ary pair.
