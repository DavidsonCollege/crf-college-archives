PANDEINIC MEMBERS.
HOTLY CONTEST DEBATE

The Pandeinic Literary Society held its
regular meeting Tuesday, March 20th. The
subject for the regular debate was: Re-
solved, That the states should adopt propor-
tional legislation, Davis, J. H., was appointed
extemporaneously to uphold the affirmative
with Franklin in the absence of the regular
debater. The point was closely contested,
one of the negative offering for the approval
of the society a “Single ballot plan” instead
of the proposed plan, whereby each voter
should cast a ballot for one candidate and
thereby secure representatives suited to a
greater number of the population. The de-
cision was awarded to the affirmative.

The other events of the program were }.
R. Maxwell, declamation; W.yT. Baker,
oration, and A. P. Hudgins, current events.
The declamation was a humorous represen-
tation of a love affair between a young
black couple. The oration was Achieving
Greatness. It was well thought out and
instructive and was delivered in a fluent
manner. The current events were selections
from the best news that could be procured
at the time.

PHI SOCIETY ENJOYS
INTERESTING PROGRAM

The question for debate on Thursday
night at the Phi Society meeting was one
of timely interest, as the political parties of
the U. S. were involved.

The qugy, Resolved, That the U. S. should
adopt’a policy of proportionate representa-
tion was upheld by C. E. Houston and R. M.
McGirt, while H_.M. Wells and J. E. Holts-
houser argued for the negative. The affirm-
ative won out, but not without a fight, for
the negative put up a good defense.

R. O. Sellars gave several selections from

Current Events, and A. B. Williford gave
his declamation on The Voice of the Flag
with a force that set forth the strength and
manhood for which our National emblem

stands, and, although its history has been
told time and again, the old chandelier which
hangs in the hall was again chosen as a
subject for an oration by R. H. Browne.

EUMANEANS HEAR FOUR
SPEAKING ASPIRANTS

The Eumanean Society held its regular
meeting last Thursday. Preliminaries for
Junior Speaking were held and four re-
nowned orators of the Junior class strove
mightily for the coveted right to become
Junior Speakers. The successful men were
R. H. Smith and L. D. Elkins.

The first oration, “America’s Failure”,
was well delivered by A. M. Hillhouse. Hie
lamented America’s lack of courage to

accept the moral leadership of the world
through that great working union of 53
countries, the League of Nations, even

though that league was conceived by an]

American.

“Provincial America” was the subject of
R. H. Smith’s oration. He pointed out in
a forceful ‘manner how America refused
world leadership because of her provinc-
ialism.

W. ‘TI. Jones’ subject was “Stiffen Your
Verebrae”. He maintained that many people
fail to develop the qualities that make up
leadership and personality through their fear
of criticism.

“Lincoln's Heritage” was the subject of
the oration by L. D. Elkins, He showed
how Lincoln met and overcame gigantic
obstacles and how our country needs men
like Lincoln to carry it on,

The judges were Douglas,
Foreman and Wagner. ‘The opening prayer
was given by P. B. Freeland. The society
adjourned after voting to change the time
of meeting from 7:00 to 7:15 P. M.

METROPHILIANS HAVE
BEST MEETING OF YEAR

Professors

The Metrophilians held their best meet-
ing of the year on last Tuesday evening.
The subject for regular debate was: Re-
solved That the United States should adopt
the form of proportional representation, The

ed their points well, and warmly supported
them. The judges decided in favor of the
negative. Bradford and Henderson upheld
the affirmative against McIntosh and Mc-
Leod. '

The subject for extemporaneous debate
was, Resolved: That, with respects to the
powers of nature, the Government should
provide vapor ovens to protect fruit against
late frost. The points were hotly contested,
but the judges decided in favor of the
negative. S

dalism, and Dr. Porter made a few helpful
remarks to the society.

Court of Control Working
Faithfully with Freshmen

(Continued from Page 1)

is a large amount of evidence against the
man in question, that body always follows
the instructions of the men who do the re-
porting. The Court is striving by every
possible means to cooperate with those up-
perclassmen who take. interest enough ‘in
the freshmen class to report men and it will
use every power within its grasp to see
that justice is done both to freshmen and
upperclass men.

Were it not for the fact that a crowd
of students would detract from the effi-
ciency of the Court’s actions, students would
be permitted to attend the meetings. As
it is, that body has requested the presence
of several outsiders at different times and
all who have attended approve of the
methods used.

The Freshman who is to appear is
brought before the Court which usually
meets in one of the halls on the campus.
If the charges are serious enough to war-
rant it, he is sworn in; if not he is asked
to take a seat in front of the judge. The
judge then asks the clerk to read the charge
and the man before the Court can either
deny or accept it. Should he do either he
is asked if he has anything to say and
when he has finished the Court, individually
--questions him. If the case needs no: more

attention ‘than a straight talk the Court
talks to him personally, individually, man
to man, and the freshman is at liberty to
accept or reject what is said, at his pleasure.
If the case is serious enough to deserve a
further penalty than a stiff talk the fresh-
man. is taken outside while the Court de-
bates on the evidence and decides on the
punishment. The man in question, is then
brought again before the Court and in-
formed of its decision. He is at liberty
to accept or appeal to a higher body.

This is the general procedure followed.
And the talks that the freshmen receive
are not lukewarm, either. So far as the
Court has been able-to determine, however,
all of the men who have appeared have
taken what was said in the proper spirit
and have expressed their appreciation for
what was said to them.

of affairs in England ended on a note of
hope that things would right themselves in
time.

The government of France has loaned
the people many times more than she has
received from Germany, and her situation
is becoming more critical every day. The
crying need of France combined with the
feeling that she is being dealt with un-
fairly are the factors at the bottom of the
Ruhr occupation.

If England and France are in serious
difficulties, the position of Germany is far
worse. Mr. Higgs did not go into a long
discussion as to whether or not Germany
had money, but confined himself, in large
measure, to showing how hard it was for
the government to get the money from the

people. Threatened by both Monarchists
and Bolsheviks, the government fears to
tax the people for money to pay unpopular
debts lest there be a great revolution. In-
stead the question is postponed by the: is-
sue of paper money.
