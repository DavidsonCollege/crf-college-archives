Guys and Dolls here next two weekends.

By PETER HAIRSTON
Staff Writer

Straight from the streets,
saloons, and sewers of New
York City, a cast of thirty-four
gamblers, dance hall girls, and
religious zealots will take you
back in time to the Fabulous
Fifties. Directed by Dr. Rupert
T. Barber, Jr., and accom-
panied by a 23-piece orchestra
under Dr. William D. Lawing,
they are ready to sing and dance
their way into your hearts.

“The show has style, humor,
pathos, and songs that you can
go away from the performance
singing. It will be a fun musi-
cal,’’ said Barber.

Performances will be held on
April 26, 27, 28, and on May 2
through 5 beginning at 7:30 on
weeknights and 8:15 on week-
ends. Tickets are on sale at the
box office in the Fine Arts
Building (2-5 p.m. weekdays),
and at various locations around
campus.

Davidson's ‘‘Guys and Dolls”’
is a rollicking rendition of the
1950 Broadway hit musical,
which ran for three years
straight. It won the New York
Drama Critics’ Circle Award,
and received wide acclaim for
its integration of music and
lyrics with a substantial plot.

The show features a variety

of songs (“The Oldest Estab-
lished Permanent Floating Crap

Game in New York,’’ “I'll
Know,” “I’ve Never Been in
Love Before,"’ and ‘‘Luck Be a
Lady"’), and dances (in Havana
by wild and crazy Cubans, and
in a New York sewer by the
crapshooters).

Most of all, however, ‘‘Guys
and Dolls’’ is a love story,
charming and romantic, involv-
ing the most unlikely of cou-
ples: Sarah and Sky, and Ade-
laide and Nathan.

Leading roles are played by
Cindy Faulkenberry, Eddie Pol-
lock, Gail Maynard, Lana Sims,
and Tom Besselieu.They are
ably supported by a chorus of
crapshooters, ‘“‘Hot Box” girls,
and others who lend “‘Guys and
Dolls” a degree of quality and
depth outstanding for a student
production.

Preparations for this produc-
tion have required a massive
effort on the parts of directors,
members of the cast and orches-
tra, and many others. Dr.
Barber is the director; Dr. Joe
Gardner is the Technical Direc-
tor; and Dr. Lawing the. Musi-
cal Director, The spectacular
sets have been designed by ,
Senior Steve Cline as his thesis
project for the Center for Spe-
cial Studies.

Mrs. Nancy Gardner is res- .
ponsible for choreography, a
remarkable achievement consi-
dering the large number of

(Ron Chapple)

crapshooters with ten big toes.
Mrs. Barber has created the
costumes. Mrs. Linda Warren
has helped the leads with their
singing. Finally, there are all
those students, in drama clas-
ses and otherwise, who have
helped in so many ways.

Dressage judge heads barn

By JEFF MCARN
Staff Writer

There is a new flavor in the
air out at the barn. Davidson is
slowly edging closer and closer,
sniffing, and liking what it
smells. Spring is here, that’s
true, but that is only part of the
scent. The rest of it has
something to do with hamburg-
ers grilled on an open fire down
by the pond. Or the handy
cooking of Mrs. Black inthe
early morning hours. Or the
fresh sunlit air that breezes by
the riders as they explore a new
trail ride. Davidson horse en-
thusiasts are finding more ex-
cuses to forego the weekend
work ethic in favor of some of
the new happenings at the
riding stables.

The last weekend in March, a
riding clinic was held at the
barn under the direction of Mrs.
Eldon, S. Dummit, mother of
Virginia Dummit, Davidson
student (80), intimately involv-
ed with the riding program. The
clinic was fortunate to have
access to the wealth of know-
ledge and experience in Mrs.
Dummit for the weekend.

For the past ten years she has
been working with two interna-
tionally known equestrians
from Austria, associated with
the Spanish Riding School. She
owns a judges card for Dres-
sage—that is, she is qualified to
judge Dressage events, a speci-
fic technique of riding, in offi-
cial competition. Each partici-
pant in the clinic had the oppor-
tunity for two private, 45
minute lessons with Mrs. Dum-
mit, one on Saturday and the
other on the Sunday of that
weekend.

Sunday morning, the partici-
pants were out on the trail at
eight o’clock. During an hour of
roving through many of the
three hundred acres of available
pasture and woodland, the
group had a chance to work on
some of the tips they picked up
in their lessons.

They also had a good chance
to work up an appetite. It was a
good thing, too, because Mrs.
Black had rustled up a king
sized ranch breakfast fit even
for the likes of a’Hoss Cart-
wright. Grits, scrambled eggs,
bacon, sausage, home-made
biscuits, it was enough to make
the horses grimace at the
thought of the additional ton-
nage. :
Mrs. Black is the able-bodied

cook of Mr. Jim Howard, the
able-bodied benefactor who has
made the whole riding stable
dream come true for Davidson
students. The riding program
also depends on donations from
independent sources for its
stock of horses. Much of the
program’s success is indebted
to the generosity of its horse
-donors.

The riding program is making
strides, however, toward be-
coming more self-sufficient. By
this summer, according to Vir-
ginia Dummit, the program will
be raising enough money to
cover the salaries of both the
manager and assistant manager
at the barn.

Virginia will be spending the
summer at the barn, and as-
suming its management while
Kathleen takes a. well-deserved
break. Kathleen says, smiling,
that her summer plans involve
“a lot of riding.” For Virginia,
there will be a good bit of work
between her riding sessions.

While attempting to promote
the summer riding lessons, to
be taught by Pam Brackett and
herself, Virginia has plans to
condition some of the horses for
fox hunting for students. to
enjoy next fall. ‘‘This involves a
lot more jumping and training
for the horses,’’ Virginia ex-
plains. ‘‘We plan to build jumps
on some of the trails.”’

a ‘ | b i * t

Each trail ride is followed by
a cookout and campfire, neither
of which can be considered run-
of-the-mill. That is unless you
always have red wine with your
hamburgers. Coming soon is a
marathon, overnight trail ride
of seven to ten miles over choice
Mecklenburg County back
woods.

Yes, things are changing out
at the barn. There is new
fencing around the permanent
pasture, split rail and woven
wire. A new Dressage ring is
almost finished. Come on out,
the times are great. You can’t
miss it; just follow your nose.
