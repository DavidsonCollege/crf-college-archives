Davidson Rugby Finishes
Second in Tri-State Invitational

By Dack Stackhouse
On Saturday the Wildcats trav-

-eled to Johnson City, Tn. to par-

ticipate in the last round of the
Johnson City’s Tri-State Invita-
tional, representing clubs from

’ Tennessee, Virginia, and North

Carolina. In the first match
Davidson shut out Southwest Vir-
ginia State College.

Scotch Tumer scored the first

try by picking up the ball from the
back of a ruck and running ten
meters for a diving try.

In the second half, Turner
again scored, this timeona penalty
run which he initiated quickly dur-
ing the confusion of an offsides
call. Jamie Brown converted both
tries and added a penalty kick from
the midfield line, leading to the 17-

outs are rare inrugby, so Davidson
gained much confidence through
this bone crushing win.

After the first game, the Wild-
cats entered the final game as the
big underdogs against the formi-
dable Johnson City Men’s Club.
The ‘Cats played with intensity,
holding the score even through
much of the second half.

Johnson City scored first on a
penalty run from three meters out.
Soon afterwards, the Davidson

_Scrum pushed over the ball in the

try zone and collapsed on top of it,
yielding a scrum try. However,
late in the second half, Johnson
City was able to score a penalty
kick, leading the Silver Bullets toa
10-7 victory over Davidson.

The Davidson Rugby Club felt
very confident after their perfor-
mance at Johnson City. Playing
well against high calibre teams in-
dicates that they should do well in
the North Carolina State Tourna- -
ment at Greensboro.

The ‘Cats have a two week
restand their have their final home
game on March 27.
