El Segundo, California — At a
press conference Tuesday, Rod
Benimy, CEO of Mattel, confirmed
growing suspicions concerning the
use of lead paint in numerous pop-
ular toys. Thomas the Tank
Engine, Dora the Explorer, and
even the newly added Bruce Aider
the Crusader have been reported to
contain lethal amounts of lead
paint, according to the Consumer
Product Safety Commission. Mr.
Benimy defended the company’s
decision to continue putting their
units on the shelves of toy stores
around the country.

Three a.m. in a Kappa Sig stall
and I didn't know where I was.
First Night Down started off with
sweet lines of Bolivian Marching
Powder on Base Rich with Cliff
Huxtable before our reservation at
Kudzu, where we tipped 35 percent
but didn't pay. Then stood up our
big sisters, barged in on Vespers,
plundered Turner, stole Cliff's
roommate's Porsche, did donuts in
Satellite, called the cops on sub-
free kids, slugged down
Goldschlager and Gatorade, made
an appearance at SAE, got high
backstage with the band, found out
they were only DJs, didn't care,
made out with girls, jumped off the
balcony, started a fire, chopped

cone, then yeah, little Bobby or
Gina might sleep a bit longer than
usual when nap time comes along.
But as long as children interact
with these toys in moderation, the
levels of lead are actually very
healthy dietary supplements.”

Protesters flocked in the hun-
dreds to the headquarters demand-
ing further explanation. After a
childish chant of “Mattel, go to
hell,” and “Benimy’s the enemy,”
the crowd quieted enough to hear
Benimy’s response.

“It’s not the toys that are danger-
ous, but the lethal amount of time
these kids spend playing with
them. Lead paint is not the enemy
here. Overexposure to lots of con-
ceivably healthy things, like broc-
coli or sunshine can be dangerous,
too, you know.”

In a graph that he drew in front
of the crowd, Benimy compared
chewing on a toy with lead paint
for half an hour a day to standing
50 feet from the sun for four sec-
onds.

“See,” he remarked, “you would
last about a year and a half with
that toy in your mouth, but you’ ve
got about a tenth of a second
against the sun. Who’s the big bad
wolf now? We should focus more
on relevant problems like the
depletion of the ozone layer and

down a tree, headed to the Union,
sang Karaoke to “Susudio”-a great,
great song, a personal favorite-then
longboarded back down the hill to
the court, back to SAE, didn't let
the girl at the door stamp our
hands, set off a stink bomb, blamed
it on this blonde chick, made out
with the blonde chick, made
mysoginistic comment about
blonde chick, made excuse to
leave, said we had to return some
videotapes, not sure what we
meant, correction, what I meant,
realized I was alone, inside a
Ranch style house, people leaving,
lights on, people pointing, staring,
saying things like “He'll never get a
bid,” me trying to escape them,
staggering to the door, the bath-
room door, the girls bathroom
door, frightening some young lass,
not caring, mumbling I was “just
trying to live,” (leave?) her leav-
ing, me crying, the floor slamming
in my face, then hours later
Fountain Walker standing over me,
handing me my Cat Card, my cell
phone and a hand up, asking,
“What happened, son, what hap-
pened?”

“College,” I mumbled, already
fading to black.

Thomas the Tank Engine is now
both a great birthday present and
a dietary supplement.

Parents throughout the nation are
panicking, and sales have dropped
by 43% at KB Toys and 41% at
Toys “R” Us. Mattel does not
claim to be worried even though
the busiest time of the year is
approaching with the holiday sea-

Charlotte area Mattel
spokesman, Owen Zinaman, was
contacted for his response to the

He commented, ““We’re not wor-

lead paint here and there for added
vitamin content. My idea never
got approved, but I wanted to
come out with Darwin the Marlin,

Darwin’s head. It would have
been made purely of lead paint
which had been marinating for 25
years. Hey, if it doesn’t kill you,
it'll make you stronger, and if it
does kill you, well, then you prob-
ably shouldn’t have been here in
the first place. Ha ha. Ohhhh, evo-

Hyperrealistic Video Game
Mimics Dullness of War

In an attempt to recreate the tedi-
um of the Flanders Campaign, EA
Games has released Call of Duty
IV: Trench Warfare.

This latest installment in the
series concentrates on the monoto-
ny of military life in the European
Theater, forsaking thrill and
adreneline for absolute verisimili-
tude.

Players spend hours in their fox-
holes playing spades, speculating
on their wives’ infidelities, and
whittling toy soldiers out of soap.
The remote Luftwaffe and the High
Command are replaced by the

Allies' true enemies: rats, blisters,
and the onset of depression.

Another realistic aspect of the
gameplay is the pacing. A player
will inevitably beat the game
exactly six years and one day after
he starts, unless he chooses to play
as the Axis Powers, in which case
his apartment will be looted by
Russians.

“It's certainly painstaking,” says
avid gamer Pat de Kisscher ‘09,
who has spent 11 months trying to
beat the first level. “But I think it
will be especially rewarding if I
can liberate Paris by senior year.”
