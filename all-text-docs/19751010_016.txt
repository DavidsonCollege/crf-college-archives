l’ve Hurt Someone

| was playing a disdainful left field
When the
moonish softball was
Whacked and curving foul into the woods
Over third and down the line
| sprinted for lack of
anything else to do
Tightroped on the edge of the tulies
To make a backhanded stab before it
hit the ground"
After the cut-off man was
Pegged in the chest | ignored the
Diamond dilemma to glance
Into the trees and weeds
so effortfully avoided a few
seconds ago and
Longed to run and run streaming
With sweat from my eyes
eating roots and berries
the rest of my life

The Artist
you paint with colors, and | paint with words.
your dreams are best seen, while mine are best heard.

but the music comes through in your colors and lines
and the songs that you paint have a tune much like mine.

you showed me your gallery, eyes shining fire
explaining how painting expressed your desires

and it seemed that | saw in your blues and your greens
the poetry inside you that cries to be seen.

but | don’t need culture or sculpture tonight.

| just need two warm eyes to find when it’s light.
don’t scold me, just hold me...I’m empty inside.
| feel out of rhyme and my music’s run dry.

there’re times when you find the words just won't come.
you've tried every color, but none’s the right one

and you need no excuses, abuses, or harm,

just comfort in silence, a smile, and warm arms

no; | don’t need culture or sculpture tonight.

| just need a warm smile to find in the light

so don’t scold me, just hold me...I’m empty inside.
| feel out of rhyme and my music’s run dry.

yes, you paint with brushes, and |, with my pen

but it’s really no matter, because, in the end

the thoughts and the dreams that we paint seem the same.
the art’s in the artist, whatever the name.
