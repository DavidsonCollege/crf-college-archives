JAKE MARTIN, Prop.
: |

Prof. (on History Class) —"What are the
requirements for a good knight?”
The Dude—"Darkness.”

"Twas at a wedding yesternight,
A young man sat sedately.

I asked him if he'd kissed the bride,
He answered, “Ng, not lately.”

The saddest words of tongue or pen
Are these three words—"Two-timed again.”

The flapper stands before the mirror, pow

“Well, clothes, ['m going to town. * If

Mildred has a perfect line;
But Helen laughs at all these jokes—
She’s my Valentine.

They tell us that Rube Curdts is so dumb
that he thinks a baby carriage is a blunder-
buss. He also thinks that celluloid is a sister

Keels—"See what swallow?"
Boushee—"That bird.”

Keels—"No, what did he swallow?"

“I'm going to the country.”
“For the week-end?”
“No, for heart trouble.”

about Hawaii?”
Flake (just waking up)—"Sir?
Prof, (impatiently )—" Hawaii?”

Laird, what do you’ know

“I'm up against a hard proposition,” said
the mosquito as he lit on the professor's bald
head.

Salem—"Diamonds are the hardest stones,

Queens—"Yes, the hardest to get.”

Women are like matehes—if you aren't
careful with them®you'll get burnt.

With only one week left in the Ugly
Man's Beauty Contest, Dapper Dan Keels is
still leading the field. The voting during
the past week has been heavier than before,
and rivalry has become so intense that Keels
has been threatened by. Nappy Davis, who
is asking to be called Davidson's Ugliest
Man. At present Dapper Dan has 170 votes;

Irving Johnson has 100.) Skit MeConnell has
offered a dope free to any man who avill
vote for Irving, but only a few have aceept-

enough to vote for Keels and Davis, believ

The contest closes next week, and the hand

Sam Summers, shiek from
Marion Jnnetion, Alabama, will present the
prize to the winner.

The speaker mentioned the fact that
enough power could be held in the palm of
the hand which, if turned loose, would blow
up New York City. “But before I want my
son to have such power in his hands, I ‘want
