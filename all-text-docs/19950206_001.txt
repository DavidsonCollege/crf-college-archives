Gullan and Buford burn up SGA election

When the election results finally came
in last Tuesday, junior Bill Gullan and sopho-
more Warren Buford had nothing but com-
pliments for each other, as the new SGA
President and Vice President, respectively.

“T’m looking forward to working with
Warren. He’s a very competent individual,”
Gullan said Tuesday evening when the run-
off against junior Allison Sabel yielded him
the victory. The run-off resulted from the
initial race among Gullan, Sabel, and junior
Bo Bartholomew.

Buford says he would have been “happy
to work with any of the candidates, but I’m
really excited about working with Bill. He’s
such a dynamic person.”

“Put some bite in the SGA.” He plans to
begin immediately “implementing my plat-
form of greater student involvement, repre-
sentation in the admissions process, and
achieving unity among the many student
groups on campus.”

Buford counts student involvement as
one of his primary goals. He emphasizes the
importance of “educating the school about
the SGA. I'd like to see a flow chart for
students so if they want something done,
they know how to do it.”

As they prepare to begin their terms,
both Gullan and Buford stress the SGA’s
role in enhancing life for all students at
Davidson. Says Buford, “We want to give
to all members of the school what they
expect from us.”

Campus to see the light; senators receive “blank check”

By ASHLYN DANNELLY

Last week freshman SGA
senator Lucian Dervan and Senior
Class President B.J. Rudell by-
passed the SGA and took matters
into their own hands, successfully
obtaining unlimited funding for
better lighting on campus. The
two senators’ quest began with a

letter to Vice President for Busi-

ness and Finance Bob Sutton-re-
questing that a percentage of fees
gained from parking tickets gotoa
security fund, which would then
be used to improve campus light-
ing.

The evolution of an idea

Dervan and Rudell also met
with Director of Public Safety &
Police Ray Thrower, Rudell says,
“with two objectives: parking and
lighting. We hoped to solve both.

Lighting had always been a prob-
lem, then high parking tickets came
later.”

However, Rudell says, “low-
ering parking tickets is pretty much
a lost cause .... they see it (parking
fines) as a way to balance the bud-
get... if we ask them to lower them,
they’re going to have to come up
with the money elsewhere.”

Lowering parking tickets is
like lowering the tuition. It’s not

going to go down.” Rudell en-
courages people to “read the park-
ing rules carefully and appeal tick-
ets if necessary.”
Small victory

Yet, Rudell and Dervan gained
asmall victory: the lowering of the
automobile re-registering fee from
10 to three dollars. This fee now
charges students for just the price
of their parking sticker when they
change automobiles for whatever

reason. Rudell says the change
was “‘a concession for not chang-
ing the parking ticket costs.”
The SGA’s role

When Dervan and Rudell dis-
cussed their letter in last Tuesday’s
SGA meeting, Dervan says, “Vari-
ous figures on the SGA, at the
mention of the word ‘parking tick-
ets,’ started complaining about high
