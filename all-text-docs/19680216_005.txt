A Message For Midwinters

Here it is again. Another Midwinters dance week-
end and I'm away from. Davidson with the basketball
team. This makes three years in a row. This year it's
George Washington in the nation’s capital. You know
GW, the team which has won only one game this year
and that was against Montana. I wonder how good
Montana must be.

It's not that I have anything against Washington,
but Midwinters is one of the few times at Davidson
there are more than ten girls in the whole town. I
think the college and the fraternities should lower
the basketball players’ social dues because we do miss
concerts and parties.

Roadtrips aren’t all the glamour-and prestige that
many people think they are. Theyswie’aren’t fun in
themselves. As Lefty said at the beginning of the
season, “Everything is strictly business on the road.”
In some ways the whole basketball season seems like
business to me.

Sometimes I think Lefty would have an easier
time recruiting if he would put up posters in high
schools around the country saying, “Play for the Da-
vidson Basketball Team, See the World!’ Besides
traveling to the cities in the immediate area when we
play Southern Conference teams, we have been to
Milwaukee, New York, New Orleans, Nashville and
other tourist attractions.

We always wear our custom made traveling
clothes: the red blazer, black and white houndstooth
checked trousers, and, of course, a club tie with little
wildcats all over it. The reaction by the public to 14
boys six feet and over, decked out in this attire,
is very interesting. A man sitting next to me on the
last plane trip to Richmond asked me what instrument
I played, and for which band. One small lady thought
we were an advertising gimmick for ‘Eastern Air Lines,
but most people figure out that we are members of a
basketball team. When we tell them we’re from Da-
vidson College, the usual answer is, “That’s nice.
Where is it?”

Roadtrips are about as enjoyable as we make them.
We travel first class always, flying to most of the
games, staying in the better motels, and eating at the
nicer restaurants. But we all know it’s strictly business.
We usually have a number of team meetings a day
with the remainder of the time spent “knocking around
our rooms.” This is Lefty’s favorite saying for confin-
ing us to our motel rooms. But if there is time, we do
get to walk around the city somewhat or see a movie.
Usually, as unbelievable as it might sound, we can’t
wait to get back to Davidson.

This Friday or Saturday, when you are watching
the concerts, or dancing at the parties, or doing some-
thing else enjoyable, don’t envy us. You can bet we're

after its second consecutive
win today in a meet with
Emory in the Johnston Gym
pool. The ‘Catfish picked up
a win last Friday over Ap-
palachian State University

pointed with the times in that
meet, but the team never
was in danger of losing the
meet,’’ Coach Tom Stevens
said.

Mac Davis and Jack
Steele led the attack. Davis
won the 50 and the 100 yard

Winless Sharpshooters
Aim For Final Matches

The winless Davidson rifle
team has four more matches
left this season. They lost
their last outing to Wofford.
last Friday on the Davidson
range.

Sergeant First Class Win-
zlo G. Hannah, coach of the
sharpshooters, expleined
that a rifle match is scored
on the basis of a possible
1500 team points.

Six shooters fire for each
team. Each participant fires
from three positions: stand-
ing, kneeling and prone. Each
shooter can score a possible
300 points.

The points of the top five
shooters on each team are
added together. Davidson's
loss to Wofford was by a
close 1216-1182 score.

Hannah said that senior

Frank Powell has been the

best shooter on the Wild-

cat team this season.

On the Davidson range.
Feb. 23, the rifle team will
shoot in an effort to qualify
for the 3rd Army Postal
Match. Their scores will be
sent in to the 3rd Army and
compared to the scores of the
other schools entered.

Wildcat team will travel to

Cagers Clip Hawks’ Wings
Roll Up Sixth Straight Win

Vicious Wildcat defense
kept the St. Joseph's Hawks
from ever getting off the
ground Wednesday night, as
Davidson trimmed the Phila-
deiphia team 66-60. The win
was the sixth straight for the
‘Cats.

The highly partisan crowd
in the renowned Palestra had
to watch as Dave Moser per-
formed another beautiful de-
fensive show. ‘Ihe dependable
Wildcat held Dan Kelly to
nine points, all in the second
half. Kelly had been hitting
19 points a ball game.

Mike Maloy provided the
leadership for the ‘Cat of-
fensive effort, dumping in
19 big points. But equally
important, Matoy dragged
down 19 rebounds, domi-
nating the boards at both
ends of the courf.

Four Wildcats scored in
double figures. as the David-
son offensive attack contin-
ues to be well-balanced.

St. Joseph's never allowed
the ‘Cats to pull away in the
game. But with little time re
maining and Davidson lead-
ing, the Hawks were forced
to commit several personal
fouls.. The Wildcats made
good on nearly all these late
free throws to provide the
winning margin.

The Richmond game was
unusual in that it was one of

it close in the first half, be-

and walked away in the sec-
ond half.

he Hu

If you don’t agree that
business destroys individuality,
maybe it’s because you're an

individual.

There’s certain campus talk that claims

&

vide things Bell telephone companies need.

individuality is dead in the business world. Because communications are changing fast,

That big business is a big brother destroy-

ing initiative.

But freedom of thought and action, when
backed with reason and conviction’s cour-
age, will keep and nurture individuality
whatever the scene: in the arts, the sciences,

and in business.

Scoffers to the contrary, the red corpus-
cles of individuatity pay off. No mistake.

Encouraging individuality rather than
suppressing it is policy in a business like
Western Electric—where we make and pro-

these needs are great and diverse.

Being involved with a system that helps

keep people in touch, lets doctors send car-
diograms across country for quick analysis,
helps transmit news instantly, is demand-
ing. Demanding of individuals.

If your ambition is strong and your abili-

ties commensurate, you'll never be truly
happy with the status quo. You'll seek
ways to change it and—wonderful feeling!—
some of them will work.

Could be at Western Electric.
