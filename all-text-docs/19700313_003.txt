36 minutes, but didn’t play
ball for four minutes and
lost the game.’ The loss
left the ‘Cats 22-5 for ‘the
year, while it was St. Bona-

Brown Brings Enthusiasm To Post

As Wildcat Defensive Back Coach

By ERNIE SHIPE
Asst. Sports Editor

Evans Brown leaned back
in his chair as he talked
on the phone to a football
Prospect and his coach. En-
thusiastically and  convine-
ingly he told John Weber of
Mansfield, Ohio, his sincere
beliefs—about the. virtues of_
Davidson.

“This boy could be a real
sleeper,’ Brown said. “He
was out with an injury mis-
sing five ggmes and still
made all-contérence in one
of the toughest leagues in
’ Ohio. Every time he gets his
hands on the ball, he comes |
up with an exciting play.”

Head Coach Dave Fagg is
* pleased with Brown’s enthus-

iasm. ‘“‘His first month here
it was impossible to keep up
with him,” said Fagg.

“It is exciting to see a
coach with so ‘much en-
thusiasm. He comes to us
highly recommended from’
Pride Ratterree (South Car-
olina assistant) who has one
of_the_best_football minds
around.”

Brown explained how he
became interested in the
job. ‘Three years ago Coach
Pride Ratterree and I came
out on a_ recruiting and
scouting trip through North
Carolina and Virginia. We
just happened to- stop by
Davidson to see them play
Riehmend—and—then—I-—-met—
Coaches Smith and Fagg
along with the rest of the

staff.

I happened to mention to
Coach Ratterree that there
was something about this
campus I liked. It was my
idea of what a college cam-
pus, should be and I said
this seemed like an ideal
placé to work and live. 1
hacd_-no idea. I would ever
come here and was really

lucky to be “retained by
Fagg when Homer :Smith
resigned.’* ~

Before coming to Davidson
Brown had been a graduate
assistant at South Carolina.
There he learned many les-
sons from Paul Dietzel. the

Davis set three school re-
cords with his times in the
200, the 1000 and. the 1650

tournament was the first
time that Davis, normally a
sprinter, had swum the 1650

Newton set new school
marks in the 50 and 100

and one fourth. Newton's
performance is even more

played with a good build on

His duties under Fagg will
be to replace Jimmy Jordan
as the defensive backfield
coach and to recruit in the
Midwest, West .Virginia,
Tennessec.® Kentucky, and

asked about his philosophy
of defense he said it was
very similar to Fagg's.
