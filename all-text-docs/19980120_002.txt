Jan. 22 marks the day when guest
speaker Dr. David Orr of Oberlin Col-
lege will introduce a new challenge to
Davidson College. His lecture, en-
titled “The Radicalism Holism: Eco-
logical Design and a Liberal Arts Edu-
cation”, will focus on the problem of
the human involvement in the decline
of the environment, and the role edu-
cators can play in working to resolve
it. While many people attempt to draw
attention to the destruction of our
planet, Orr’s approach sets him apart
from his colleagues.

Orr proposes that the solution to
the problem lies in the current and
forthcoming generations. This is noth-
ing new; many leaders have made the
same assertions.

However, Orr is not given to a
passive approach, where leaders make
long impassioned speeches blindly en-
trusting the future generations with
the welfare of the earth.

Rather, activism through in-
creased education is his chosen direc-
tion. By educating young adults with
the ways of creating less impact, in
addition to education in rectifying the
harmful inroads already made, the ac-
complishment of aiding the earth be-
comes feasible.

Orr does not limit his vision to
the United States, but emphasizes the
interdependence of all countries in this
endeavor saying, “If we are to make
the transition to a sustainable and de-
cent future in a world of 10 to 12
billion people in the next 50 years, the
size of the ‘human footprint’ must be
reduced 50 to 90 percent. This transi-
tion will require broad changes in our
ideas, perceptions, and values — which
make it, in large part; a challenge to
educational institutions.”

The Environmental Action Com-
mittee has been instrumental in secur-
ing Orr for this lecture, and is using
this opportunity as a big jump start for
this semester’s activities. By having
an interactive visit from Orr, the Envi-
ronmental Action Coalition hopes to
promote environmentally focused dis-
cussion on campus among students

and faculty. Amanda Walker, a lead-

The environmental challenge
is brought to Davidson

ing member of the committee, ex-
presses their purpose in having Orr as
a way to “promote discussion of envi-
ronmental awareness, and, hopefully,
an increase in interest in environmen-
tal activism”.

The Environmental Action Coa-
lition offers many ways to be active,
from the maintenance of the recycling
program, and the cleaning of Highway
77, to the making of notepads from all
those ever present flyers, and Earth
Day observances.

Orr will participate in activities
before and after his lecture and will
attend the CROP lunch Thursday at
noon in the 900 Room. On Friday,
there will be a workshop moderated
by Orr concerning actions that will
lead to a larger emphasis on environ-
mentalism at Davidson College.

Orr’s own education includes a
BA from Westminster College, an MA
from Michigan State University, anda
Ph. D. from the University of Pennsyl-
vania. Currently, Dr. Orr teaches at:
Oberlin College, and chairs the Envi-
ronmental Studies Program.

The impact of Orr’s vision for
education can be measured by the rec-
ognition given him by many environ-
mental and educational groups. He is
the recipient of a Lyndhurst Prize from
the Lyndhurst foundation, which rec-
ognizes “educational, cultural, and
charitable activities of particular indi-
viduals of exceptional talent, charac-
ter, and moral vision.” He has an
honorary Doctorate in Humane Letter
from Arkansas College, and is a dis-
tinguished scholar in residence at Ball
State University and Westminster
College in Salt Lake City. The Na-
tional Wildlife Federation awarded
him the National Conservation
Achievement Award.

In addition to teaching, Orr has
authored numerous articles and books,
including Earth in Mind and Ecologi-
cal Literacy, as well as over 90 ar-
ticles. Editor of several periodicals,
Orr also is a Trustee of the Educational
Foundation of America, and The
Annenberg Rural Challenge.

Orr will be speaking in the 900
Room of the Union at 7 p.m. on Thurs-\
day, Jan. 22, followed by a reception ,
in the Home Room. ~

Naresh Nagella of The Davidsonian
recently interviewed Davidson’s new
mayor, Randall Kinckaid. Among the
issues discussed were his office’s role
in dealing with the recent shooting and
managing the contentious issue of town
growth,

The Davidsonian: Can you basically
describe for me the type of government
that Davidson has? That is, would you
call it a strong mayor or a Weak mayor
system?

Kinckaid: We .
call it a weak
mayor, (which)
was implemented
last summer.
Now, the town ad-
ministrator is
chief administra-
tive officer of the
town. Before, it
was the mayor.
Allthe employees
used to work for
the mayor. Now,

is displaced. The town is not going to
do anything that will lead to increased
urbanization or faster growth that will
lead to dramatic changes in the quality
of life. What we have is a plan for
downtown,

If you look around, you will see
undeveloped land that belongs to the
town of Davidson. Now, the question
is: Are we going to respond to the
people who say that we should better
parking? Well, if we do that we should
look at the prospect of putting up some
retail space.

Maybe we should plan for a transit
(light rail) station in town. That could

the town board,

under the new ;

manager form, (and) all the employees
work for the town management.

As far.as I can tell, there are only
two statutory duties for the mayor. One
is to sign legal documents and the other
is to convene and preside in meetings.
Beyond that, whatever the mayor does
is whatever the mayor can do - like
consensus building or information-gath-
ering.

D: What caused you to take the job of
mayor?

K: A chance to do something for my
town. I have lived here for over 30
years.

D: What did you do before Davidson?

K: I taught economics at Davidson
College for 13 years. Later, I taught
humanities with a part time appoint-
ment.

Now, continue to part-time in the
MBA program at Queens.
a lot of former students.

D: Could you comment on some of the
major issues in town at the moment?
For example, I know there is a “growth”
debate going on now, as some towns-
people are fearing that Davidson will

become an “urban disaster” (according |

to a flyer) if growth is permitted and
more businesses move into town. Can
you comment on these fears and indi-
cate whether a “pro-growth” party ex-
ists in Davidson?

K: Most of the people came into the
meeting last Tuesday (regarding this
issue) angry at the town. (Such) anger

I gettosee ~

easily happen in the future.

The pro-
cess is now for (anyone’s) plan to be
presented and then we look over it and
change it and make sure it fits our needs.
We have to ask ourselves if we really
want all that unused land to stay empty.

D: So, do you believe there is a prospect
for manageable growth? I mean, is
there a possibility of Davidson becom-
ing a Cornelius?

K: I think Cornelius’ town board just
felt that whatever happened near the
interstate was not really part of the
town, which they considered to be
mainly separate from the interstate. And,
of course, we can easily manage growth
here Davidson to suit our needs.

D: Next, regarding the other “big”
story over Christmas - the death of
Damon Kerns and the police officer -
what role is your office playing in the
situation?

K: Our role is just beginning. We need -

to do something to honor Mark Swaney
and Charlie McLéan. In fact, Professor
Joseph Gardner is designing a plaque to
memorialize Mark that will be hung on
Feb. 17. That is the first task.

The second is considerably big-
ger. We need to ask how the town,
including the College, can respond to
tragedies of Christmas Day in a way to
prevent them from ever happening
again. So, we are starting a process
tentatively called the “Never Again”
campaign.

If only the town is involved,
though, it will not be successful. We
need the College, the churches, the Ada

Jenkins board, ( and other groups) to
participate. We especially welcome
Common Ground’s help.

Everybody will have to have a
major part. Our part will be in commu-
nity police relations. We are getting a
new officer. We hope that we can
facilitate people on the “West” side in
forming a Neighborhood Watch, but
that has to come from them. We cannot
do that.

We have looked very seriously at
the things government can do to cut
down the drug trade. One of the things
is a number of governments have tar-
geted are landlords. If the landlord has
a house that is
used for illegal
activities, that is
unacceptable, and
the government
has special oppor-
tunities to explore
(that house) com-
pared to your own
house. So, we will
look at such pos-
sibilities.

D: What, specifi-
cally, can the Col-
lege do to help?

K: The College has stepped forward
with a small step, but all big things
begin with small steps, and is looking at
why more town youth cannot go to
basketball games. They are looking at
ways to involve town youth more in
College events.

I was also delighted to hear that
Dean of Students Tom Shandley adopted
a zero-tolerance drug policy. Now, I
know that 98.7 percent of the students
on campus do not contribute to the
demand, but dealing with demand wher-
ever we can is very important.

D: Would youcharacterize the college's
relations with the town as positive?

K: Notonly are they really positive, but
they are way beyond positive. It is more
of a partnership with quiet, direct, and
regular contact. For example, we just
bought a $500,000 fire truck - a big
ladder truck.

~~ Now, we could not buy that, but
they are needed for the dormitories and
for the condos. The College stepped
forward and put up half the money for
the fire truck. The town library could
not have been built without the College’s
help as well.

D:- Students at times suggest that there
should be more student related. busi-
nesses on Main Street, considering
Davidson is a college town. Would the
town ever stop something like a sports
bar or some other student-related busi-
ness from coming here?

K: The town does not have such restric-
tions. The only problem would be get-
ting the businesses to come here.
