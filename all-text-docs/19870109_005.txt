ABOUT THE ARGUMENT

WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO
‘CALL YOUR BOYFRIEND ?

a) When the president of PhiGamma Delta
asks you to Saturday night’s Fiji Formal. -

b) After raquetball class, to tell him that the
instructor with the Australian accent and
those blue eyes did wonders for your serve.

c) When you just feel like telling him you
miss him after all.

Maybe you shouldn’t tell him everything that’s going on. But
if you still care about him, why not call and whisper some sweet
things he’ll never forget?

Like why you call using AT&T Long. Distance Ser-
vice, and why you trust AT&T's high quality service
and exceptional value.

When you tell him that AT&T g'ves you immedi-
ate credit if you dial a wrong number, he won’t

be able to get you out of his mind.

And telling him you can count on
AT&T for clea, long distance,
connections will drive
himerazy. ° /

All of which will prob- g# J

ably inspire him todrive #F §

you an excuse to blow off

that silly frat party after all. |
