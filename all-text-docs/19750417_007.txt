Nicoll wins $7000 Watson’

grant, examines l’Occitian

A young Frenchman of 20, a
university student, slashes red
paint across a wall in Mont-

He boldly paints in l’Occitan,
a Southern French dialect:

Ireland, Viernam, |’Occitan--

the same combat.

He is not afraid of his blatan-
cy, but strolls casually,
swinging his bucket of red
paint to another section of the
wall. There he colors the same
words.

There is a quest for partial -

autonomy for l’Occitan, a
region in southern France, that
drove this young man to write
these slogans.

This quest is part of a study
planned by Thom Nicoll, win-
ner of a Watson Fellowship.

Evidence of ethnic
regionalistic movements is not
only seen in Montpellier, but

other groups, like several areas
of France and Scotland, have
found it necessary to identify
themselves culturally as well
as politically, according to

Nicoll.
Just why these European
minorities have suddenly

surged for more political and
cultural recognition are some
of the questions Nicoll will in-
vestigate in his study of French
and Scottish minorities.

His proposed study won a
$7000 Watson Fellows grant.

become militant,” Nicoll said.
“There are many European

minorities: doing this, so I will”

Scotland, the Brittany
movement in northern France,

Bevan investigates Greek nomenclature |

By ANNE PELFREY

“The ancient Greeks had no
scientifically consistent ter-
minology for plants. Con-
sequently, one plant can con-
fusingly be called different
names throughout various
classical texts,’’ said John
Bevan, a recently selected Wat-
son feilowship winner.

“There has been a great
schism between the study of
scientific botany and the
classical Greek botany. I’d like
to see both studies brought
together.”

Bevan’s plan, which won him
the approval and $7000 funding
of the Watson Fellowhip Com-
mittee, will attempt to help
breach this schism.

“I certainly won’t be able to
entirely unite the studies,’’ he
smiled.

“But in a sense, that is what F eo
my study represents,’ he ad- . «
ded

Bevan will travel through
Greece to carry out his
proposed study.

“There are several ways to
clarify this mess. I plan to use
such classical works as that of
Theophrastus.

“‘He was the first Greek to at-
tempt a scientific essay on
plants and he was also a
student of Aristotle.’

Before the time of

Theophrastus, the only records
of plant life are medical recor-
ds, according to Bevan.

“T want to try to catalogue

the same plants that
Theophrastus and_ other
classical writers have

described in their work and
clear up some of this con-
fusion,” he said.

The classical texts are full of

folklore about plants as well as
plant description, according to
Bevan.

“One writer says it is
necessary to run around a cer-
tain plant three times before
picking it,”’ he laughed.

The Greeks were more con-
cerned with the use of plants
and this concern is evident in
the plants names, according to
Bevan.

“+ Leon enable

“There’s a type of oak tree

they named yokes,” he said.

“The Minoans differed from
the Greeks in that they seem to
have thought of plants in a
more aesthetic sense.

“The Minoans lived on Crete
around 1500 B.C., but their
aesthetic view of plants is
evident in the little remaining
pottery and art that has been
found,” said Bevan.

Even though Greece is one of
the richest areas of flowers in
the world, the best place to.find
them is in archeological
evaculation sites instead of the
bare countryside, according to
Bevan.

“Tt’s the sheep that cause the
problem. They roam unfenced
throughout Greece and ‘they eat
flowers,” he smiled. /

“‘Consequently, fenced ar-
cheological sites. are the best
areas to find varied species of
flowers,”’ he added.

Bevan plans to leave for
Europe around the first of July.

“I want/to spend part of the
summer at Oxford researching
my project,’”’ he said.

“Then I plan to start collec-
ting/down in the islands.

“IT hope to take advantae of
the herbariam at a university
in Athenns,”’ he said.

Bevan plans to return to the
U.S. around July 1976.

“T guess I’d better get back
and look into grad schools,’’ he
said.

Nicoll will center his study on
the language and literature of
these areas as it relates to the
politics involved.

“The most important
problem is language. L’Oc-
citian wants to keep its own
language in the schools,’’ he
said.

“‘T will study past and present
literature written in these
groups.”

Because ethnic groups are
arising # so many areas, thé

‘problem’ of. unity~-is © almost

universal, according to Nicoll.
“The problem of the ethnic

ties: back to the U.S.. For exam-
ple, the American Indians and
the Chicanos;”’ he said. ;

.““This is an important study
because it is a universal
problem. It will be interesting
to see if France. will /hold
together.” fi

The cause of these group out-
bursts could stem from a
variety of reasons. /

“One theory holds that th

“Some /people suspect IRA
involvement in’ Brittany,” he
said.

“It/has been militant there,
as a radio and a television
station were blown up,” said
Nicoll.

“In Scotland, the nationalist
party is a legitimate party,’’ he
said.

Oil finds off the coast of
Scotland gave impetus to the
nationalistic’ cause as they in-
creased economic benefits.

the languages used by each
group.

“I hope to learn Italian and
German,”’ he said.

“These may help me in un-
derstanding the different
dialects, but Parisian French
will enable me to communicate
with the french groups.”’

Nicoll took his junior year
abraod in Montpellier last
year.

He plans to leave for Europe
in July.

“T hope to in in Scotland,
for I want to take advantage of
the school in St. Andrews, the

we had heard so much about. But all
sarcasm aside, it was a remarkable
experience. I have never. known who
exactly I ran into that October Saturday
afternoon, but whoever they were, they
were not typical Davidson students.

I can’t begin to describe the shock I
experience when I look back on the
rampant naivete that ran. amuck
through my consciousness in those
days. At least I couldn’t begin to ar-
ticulate it until that exderpt from the
1922 catalogue appeared in this fish-
wrapper a couple of weeks ago. I was
amused, to say the least.

Charlotte is a town indeed--although |
an overgrown one at that--and
distinguishable from those ‘larger
cities” by its peculiar lack of culture,
nightlife, and intellectual or poetic sen-
sitivites.

I say that because I believe it to be
true, and I hope that the Davidson

engaged in that worthwhile pursuit of
keeping that World Football League
team in the fair city of Churches, in-

great thing, that Cunningham and Mar-

but I’d like to save something for future
onslaughts on those delightful topics.

helluva admission. I mean, as proud as’

I am of: being from the South, and as
willing as I am to offer a defense when
dictated by circumstance; what more
repressive influence can you name than
that of Southern culture and home

repression of blacks and women, but of

plain it.

“To spend the four formative

inestimable privilege” indeed, and the
resultant warped perspective is one
from which we may never recover com-

“Even at Davidson a young man if he
will, can find undesirable associates.”
Aha! I have finally found where I must
fit in. ‘Let it be distinctly understood
that no claim is made (but one is im-
plied) that there are no bad boys at
Davidson.‘
