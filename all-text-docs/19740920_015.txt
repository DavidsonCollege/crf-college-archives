Flaming Tilte

By C.A., ¥.B., B.B., &M.T. -

Let’s get the dirty dealings
out of the way. There comes a
time when C.A., Y.B., B.B.,
and the M.T. must pick one
freshman hall out of the
motley lot of frosh, and we
have found one.

By virtue of the power in-
vested in us by the Dread Dor-
mamu and by the wonderful
quote delivered to us by Watts

III ‘Hall: Counselor Martha

Royster, we have got us a good
’un folks.

lly pegged for ‘“‘bow-
wow”’ ronal as ‘‘the kennel’”’ or

“the pound,” our ‘squealing
new sisters from third Watts
will henceforth be dubbed as
and only as ‘‘The Sty.”

Best thing in bacon to hit
D.C. since Uncle Heavy and
the Pork Chop ‘Revue, oink
oink.

If you all got any com-
plaints, you can go squeal, er,
ah. . .complain to your hall
counselors. Sorry Emelia, but
don’t ever make no more
ultimatums no way no how.

Stumbling right along now,
it’s that time of year when

foolish flickerball starts once
more. Play starts Wednesday,
that is two days ago from the
day of this paper or two days
after it has actually been writ-
ten. Ah, the wonders of
modern-communication.

We haven't really seen the
rosters yet, but there are some
teams upon whom you can bet
your buns and come out
ahead.

Peyton Prospere is back for
another year, p'
five-year-devotion to flicker-
ball. He leads SAE to what will
probably be another good
season for the defending

champs. Jud Cuttino and Rick
Quimby will add speed and
strength once again to the
talented E’s.

Then there are the SPE’s.
Inside reports from the IMAC
Security Council headed by
full-fledged good guy and part-
time pervert C.A., say that the
SPE’s may have pulled a
boner in an early practice last
Monday, violating specific
IMAC rules disallowing the
use of IMAC fields by assholes
before the season. (Section 4,
parts S,P, and E, rule Q.)

about. thet frosh) that has

‘been employed over the last

few years.
Wheat, barley, hay, alfalfa,
what about Kappa Alpha?
Well, what about ’em? Not
much, says us. Over the past
few years, the trend of the
KA’s has been to play well only~
when they are defending the
south goal. They don’t seem to
function too well when their .
backs are facing Gettysburg.

We’d attack Pax too, but
Y.B. doesn’t feel like adda
his pen around that much.
