Wax Scratching

By BOB WHELESS

Probably not too many of you
have heard of Ralph Martiere and
his Orchestra. Chances are you will,
though, when their recording of
two old favorites, “I. Only Have
Eyes For You” and “I'll Never
Smile Again.” There hasng been
any trumpet work that velvety
waxed since the “Young Man With
A Horn” album. Both sides are
perfect for dancing and what with
a chorus, strings and wonderful
trumpet work adding to the ear
appeal of the platter it makes for
some mighty good listening too.
This Martiere is destined to go
places. Here’s hoping Mercury re.
leases a new etching by him real
soon.

Doris Day has a sure winner in
her latest waxing, “The Best Thing
For You Is Me.” I'm always tend-
ing to be rather partial to anything
she records because I, and a few
million other fellows, think she’s
slightly terrific. After you've heard
this one I don't believe anyone will
deny the fact that it wasn’t partial-
ity that prompted me to say that
it’s one of the best numbers she’s
made to date. It is without 4 doubt
the best arrangement of “The Best
Thing For Me,” even overshadow-
ing Perry Como’s scratching of
same. The fp side is another
“best,” it’s a swell, different ver-
sion of “A Bushel and a Peck.”
Be sure to give it a listen.

Gordon MacRae and Jo Stafford
combine their talents to turn out
a neat litthe wax package labeled
“Yesterday.” It’s a _ sentimental
waltz that you'll be hearing quite
frequently now that most of the
dise jockeys in the area have it.
As a flip you'll find a sequel to
“Let's Go To Church Next Sun-
day Morning.” In the latter case
looks like they're overdoing a good
thing.

If you're looking for something
different try Patti Page and Patti
Page singing “Tennessee Waltz.”
No that was no misprint, she sings
a duet with herself by singing the
first part on one record, the har-
mony on another and combining
them to obtain the finished pro-
duct, which by the way is great.
Ain’t science grand!!

Frankie Laine isn’t up to par on
his discing of “If I Were a Bell.”
If it scores it will because of his
name, not his effort on this one.
On the other side there’s a tune
written in the “Lucky Old Sun”
tradition labeled “Sleepy Ol’ River.”
Laine seems to go in for these
“Ol” songs in a big way. He gives
it that same polished folk feeling
that made “Lucky Old Sun” so
popular, so don’t be surprised if
you see this one hit parade bound
before long.

I was asked a few days ago what
T thought ‘about Judy Garland’s
“Friendly Star” which comes from
the “Summer Stock” album, which

in turn came from the sound track
of the flick
That’s a pretty dangerous question
since quite a few fellows don’t

of the same name.

think so much of Judy or her voice,
but I'll go out on a limb and say
that I think she gives a nice ren-
dition of a very nice tune. Those
of you who saw the flick will re-
member Gene Kelly's rendition of
“Heavenly Music.” Actually he was
half of a duet, but I can’t remem-
ber the other half’s name. I think
it was Hal or something-or-other.
Maybe one of you can tell me.
Anyway, to get back to the record,
in the album they spoiled the
song by not taking it off the
sound track and thusly omitting
the howling dogs that were in it
originally. What a letdown!!
Lesson number one in getting
better acquainted with some of the
musicians who play modern music.
Get hold of the Victor Album
“Charlie Ventura plays Duke El-
lington for Dancing’ and listen to
all the numbers a couple of times.
This lesson is intended to show the
“squares” that even bop artists can
play good danceable music. Once
you hear Charlie play “Solitude,”
“Prelude To A Kiss,” “Sophisticat-
ed Lady” and all the other wonder-
ful numbers in the album you'll be
convinced, and lesson one will be
complete. Lesson number two next
week will cover a few platters with
a boppish tinge, We'll go at this
stuff gradually.

Jack Ruth goes around right end
for a touchdown. Score 30.0. Be-
fore the quarter ends, Davidson
racks up another two points to
lead 32-0.

The complete inability of the

VMI team to stop the rampaging
Wildcats is annoying. They cow-
ered like slaves before their mas
ters. Davidson is once more living
up to All-American standards, and

in the fourth quarter 14 more
points are accumulated. Only in
the last minute does Davidson's

fourth string let VMI complete a
long pass for a touchdown. Final
score, Davidson 46, VMI 6.

Summing up, the concert from
the standpoint of technical profi-
ciency, was uniformly excellent.
From the standpoint of interpreta-
tion, the two artists often left
something to be desired. On the
whole, however, the concert should
have satisfied both the technical
and interpretative demands of the
listener.

In our last issue we gave con-
siderable space to the antique car-
riages of the past that somehow
manage to rattle the students on in
their merry way. In all fairness we
must give some time and space to
the transportation system of the
faculty.

After a brief check of the parking
lot behind Chambers, we can ar-
rive at a few conclusions and gener-
alities. We find that the majority
of the professors have finally given
in and sold their pre-war cars, but
no doubt with considerable regret.
Having strained the old family car-

riages to the limit, almost three-
jfourths of the professors have cars
that were bought within the last
two years. Whether this fact points
to greater post-war production or
tighter purse-string pulling to the
bitter last, your reporter cannot
say; but we can safely conclude
that it was a well car that
finally chugged into the used-car
lot.

that is where our interest is to be

There are a few die-hards among

mercy to their tired machines and
refuse to give them up. We hear
that Jimmy Hlogan has made some
good offers, but they

We feel that many questions
about the professors’ old pre-war
cars can be answered with the story
of one of our faculty. Last June
we left Prof. Martin of the Math
Department riding in an old Chev-
rolet. This’ year Capt. Martin of the
R.O.T.C. department is riding in
a, brand new Oldsmobile.

Yellow Cap Awarded
By Court In 1923

The following, unearthed from
the files of the Davidsonian of
1923, gives a contemporary pic-
ture of the Court of Control, soon
after the founding of this honorable
body.

The Court of Control has been
working steadily with the Fresh.
men. Many new regulations have
been adopted, one of the foremost
being the adoption of the yellow
cap to be worn by those freshmen
| who are under penalty. This penal-
} ty has been added in order to make
the other more
