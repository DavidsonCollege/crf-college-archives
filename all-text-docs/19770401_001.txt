Vandalism could precipitate dramatic action

Union moves to correct abuses

By CATHERINE LANDIS

The Union Board Executive
Committee proposed four solu-
tions to the problems of alco-

holic abuse, vandalism and
theft in the Union.

Their specific concerns have

’ been the vandalism in the 2nd
floor restroom, the breaking
of state laws by bringing alco-

1:00. The change of hours
could go into effect at any-
time.

The. main reason for the
change of hours proposal
comes from consideration for
the deskmen. ‘‘If beer is sold
until 1:00,’’ Bob Hill com-
mented, ‘‘we can’t close the
Union until at least 1:30,
sometimes 2:00.”’

The second proposal is to

“’M TIRED...of begging people to be decent. Begging

hasn’t worked.”

holic beverages outside the
900 Room and inside the Un-
ion, theft of phones, raiding of
candy machines, breaking of a
ping pong table, unofficial use
of the elevator, smoking and
drinking in Love Auditorium,
and other incidences which
point to abuses ot Union
privileges.

Close by midnight
First they have proposed to

change the hours beer will be
sold in the 900 Room to

8:00— 12:00 instead of until

hire a night building supervis-
or to be on duty from 4 pm
until 1 am. William Brown,
assistant director of the
Union, compares the office to
a community center building
supervisor. C. Shaw Smith,
Director of the Union hopes
the supervisor will enforce the
900 Room drinks rules and will
stop the public drunkeness.

He feels that the strict
enforcement of the rules will
decrease the amount of van-:
dalism. “The violation of the
rules puts everyone in je-

opardy,’’ Shaw comments.

The supervisor, however,
would cost the Union $45 a
day. They are working on
getting the funds now. It was
proposed the Union take some
of the funds out of program-
ming.

Patrolling supervisor

The supervisor’s job would
be to patrol the Union. He
could be paged at anytime
when needed. If he finds
someone abusing their privi-
ledges he could first bar them
from the building for an
extended period of time. If he
finds the violator in the Union
during that time he would in
cooperation with the Dean’s
office, charge them. If prose-
cuted by the Dean’s office the
violator could be charged up to
$50.

One proposal the U.B.E.C.
turned down was to close the
Union or parts of the Union
temporarily. Smith com-
ments, ‘‘We have to consider
those proposals. In the inter-
rim we want to put students
on the alert.”

Smith recognizes his actions
seem drastic but he says, ‘‘I’m
tired of dealing with children,
of begging people to be decent.
Begging hasn’t worked.”

As to Spring Frolics week-
end U.B.E.C. decided to dis-
pense beer at the Saturday af-
ternoon concert. The final de-
cision on their recommenda-
tion is left to the Council on
Campus and Religious Life
who will meet Thursday,

Cartmill initiates construction

By MARSHALL WADDELL

The Council on Campus and
Religious Life met recently
with Athletic Director Thomas
Cartmill to discuss the pro-
posed three-hole golf course.

One hole has already been
started, but as yet no funds
have been appropriated for its
completion.

Construction of the first
hole was initiated in. order to
solve several problems:
Cartmill explained, ‘‘We had
two small fields which had to
be replaced. Softball players
were constantly hitting balls
into the firs.

“‘We also had a great deal of
fill dirt and no place to put it.””

Cartmill solved the problem
by removing a row of hedge

trees and distributing the dirt
“between the two fields. This:
resulted in a four-fold increase

in usable field space.

If completed, this area will
provide the golf team witha
practice hole. The team has
been practicing at the Char-
lotte Country Club and other
places.

$60,000 total cost

Cartmill reported that the
cost-of finishing the first hole
and creating two additional
holes would be upwards of
$60,000.

Cartmill said that the cost
of maintaining this three-hole
complex could run as high as
$10,000 a year.

This maintenance cost
would include one employee to
look after the course. Cartmill
did not rule out the possibility
of using present grounds per-
sonnel, who are employed on a
year-round basis, to tend the
course.

At present, the first hole
stands uncompleted and will
remain so until funds are
allocated for it.

Dean of Students Will Terry

explained the Council’s action
in the matter. ‘‘The coucil
communicated with the Pres-
ident our concerns about the
golf course in light of priorities
established by the Goals Com-
mittee.

‘‘He indicated that he’ll
respond to us about it,’’ Terry
said.

FOCUS

Lack of

By ANNE WICKER
Staff Writer

Beginning in 1976 the hall
counselors at Davidson Col-
lege no longer received the
previous salary of $100 a term.
Many of this year’s hall coun-
selor staff have criticized the
removal of pay.

“It involves much more
than simple room depreciation
(broken furniture, soiled rugs)
and use of your car,” observed
one hall counselor. ‘‘I think
Dr. Spencer is ndt fully aware

March 31.

If beer is dispensed
concert committee will patrol
to curb public drunkeness.
Hill adds ‘‘We will also make
sure no one brings anything
beside themselves and perhaps
a frisbee into the stadium. We
do not want pitchers or
glasses.”’

Besides the drinking prob-
lem, U.B.E.C. addressed itself
to the presence of children
inside the Union, particularly
in the game room and snack
bar. After much debate they
decided to allow no children
into the Union unless accom-
panied by a designated stu-
dent. U.B.E.C. is prepared to
use name tags for this pur-

pose.
ID tags for children

The tags would be given to
those children in the Step
Tutoring. program and to any
others who have a designated
student with them.

Faculty children would be
considered individually by

Smith and given a name tag if
approved.

William Brown feels the
“kid problem”’ will be solved
enough to recognize anyone
who might disturb the Union
or the students.

Smith has solicited the sup-
port of the U.B.E.C. members
to enforce the rules. He told
them, ‘I don’t think many of
us have been willing to stick
our necks out. I need your
support.”

He went on to say, ‘‘The 900
Room works when students
want it to work.”’

Drunk. vs. disorderly

U.B.E.C. seemed willing to
take on the responsibility,
especially about drinking
abuses. John Cravet said, ‘‘If
you get drunk, that’s your
business. If you get disor-
derly, that’s our business.”

Smith and U.B.E.C. ex-
pressed the desire to avoid
drastic measures if possible.
As Smith says, ‘‘The main
thing we need to do is to get
the attention of the campus.”’

Extended Studies unchanged

By AMANDA HALL
Managing Editor

The Educational Policy
Committee (EPC) has not
completed their study of Dav-
idson’s academic program be-
cause it has not met in over a
month.

EPC Chairman, Academic
Vice-President Frontis W.
Johnston indicated to The
Davidsonian in January that
the study would be submitted
to the faculty for a vote in
either February or March.

“The committee is waiting
for a report that I am sup-
posed to write a rough draft
for,’ said Johnston.

He has not completed the
report because he has been
busy with admissions, exams,
and ‘‘I am basically lazy,’’ he
said.

The study of Davidson aca-
demics is expected to include

EPC delays action

an analysis of the independent
studies program and may
recommend changgs in that
program.

But because the report of
the EPC has yet to appear,
Extended Studies Chairman
Hansford Epes has élready
submitted his plans for the
Extended Studies next year.

“T have no reason to believe
Extended Studies I and II will

change at all (next year),’’ said
Epes.

The EPC report will prob-
ably be too late to alter
Extended Studies next year.

Said Johnston, ‘‘I think

nothing will be done about it
(Extended Studies) at all, I
think it is too late to do
anything about it for next
year.”

“T’m glad we'll have more
time to think about Extended
Studies,’’ Epes said.

pay sparks criticism

of the tremendous influence
the hall counselors have on the
freshmen: The hall counselor
is usually a responsible person
with positive attitudes and
they transmit these attitudes
to the freshmen. The hall
counselor is largely respons-
ible for helping the freshman
to adjust. Paying the hall
counselors would be the mer-
est token of appreciation.”

Another hall counselog ad-,

ded, ‘‘We don’t do our jobs to

get paid but they sevit to tanec |

advantage of the fact we don’t
do it for the money.”

“They play up the fact that
it’s an honor and play down
the fact that it is a job,” said
one student.

Several of the hall counse-
lors contacted by The David-|
sonian had individual situa-
tions which further complicate
the matter. ‘‘I work eleven
hours per week work study,”
said one hall counselor. ‘‘It
