Reagan pushes contra aid; Bush and Rather trade fierce words

By KATHERINE PRICE

Headlining the news January 21-February
2:
Across the Nation -- President Reagan
gave a State of the Union Address to the
nation last Monday, calling for bipartisan-
ship in the upcoming year. Reagan urged
congressional support for the intermediate
nuclear forces treaty and for additional
contra aid. The contra aid vote for the
Nicaraguan rebel forces is scheduled for
February 3 in the House, and for February
4 in the Senate. Reagan is pushing for $32
million in humanitarian aid, as well as $3.6
million in military aid.

Vice president George Bush became
involved in a heated argument with CBS
News anchor Dan Rather during a Monday
night broadcast last week. Bush and Rather

argued over the vice president’s role in the.

Iran/contra affair. Bush said Rather was
implying he had lied about his involvement
with the arms shipments to the Nicaraguan
contra rebels. Public reaction to the argu-
ment between Bush and Rather may affect
voters’ reactions in the upcoming Iowa
caucuses on February 8.

Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), a bitter
opponent of the INF treaty, voiced his
reservations about Soviet complicity with
the treaty to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.

Helms claimed to have a classified intel-
ligence report that proved Soviet viola-
tions. Helms recently has disagreed with
Secretary of State Schultz and Secretary of
Defense Carlucci on matters of verifica-
tion.

Around the World -- The Sandinista gov-

sions last week, hoping to end the war
between the Sandinistas and the contra
rebel forces| Sandinista leader Daniel
Ortega offered direct negotiations with the
contra leadership, monitored by an interna-
tional body.

Israel witnessed more violent flare-ups as
tensions persist in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip. The U.S. an-
nounced a new initiative to deal with the
Palestinian question in those territories,
which would consist of Palestinian elec-
tions for self-government.

‘In related matters, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak met with Reagan admini-
stration officials in Washington last week
to discuss Middle East peace prospects, and
the recent Palestinian unrest in the Israeli-
occupied territories. The U.S. sent envoy
Philip Habib to Jordan to discuss its role in

ernment of Nicaragua made major conces-

the Middle East peace process.

In Haiti; Leslie Manigat was elected
president. Manigat hasbeen noted for his
intelligence, which many observers
thought would make him unappealing to
peasants.

The Haitian election has been criticized
as undemocratic by the U.S., and has been
denounced by opposition leaders.

Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Nori-
ega, accused of organizing cocaine smug-
gling, will be indicted be a U.S. federal
grand jury. Noriega denies the charges.

In the Philippines, local elections pro-
ceeded, after fears of violence delayed
some balloting. President Aquino hopes
the elections will show renewed support for
her administration.

After anine year break, Egypt and Tuni-
sia restored diplomatic relations. -

SELF-SELECTION, from p.1

the rule is meant to “spur fresh-
men to do better academically. |

[Grades were] a problem for last
year’s freshmen, and even more
so the year before.” Terry added,
“I just don’t think that freshmen
should be wasting their time with
Patterson Court activities before
they have at least a 2.0.”
Broaddus agreed: “The rule-is
good. Those without a 2.0, with
the support and understanding of
the houses, will do their very best
to achieve that grade.” Students

whose grades make them ineli-
gible to join houses need only
receive a 2.0 for one term in order
to lift the restriction.

Rumors have sifted about that
both PAX and Warner Hall had
experienced financial difficulties
after receiving a relatively small
number of new members last year;
however, in fact, both houses are
in strong financial shape.

PAX presidcnt Vicky Rogers
said that this year’s “wonderful
freshmen” bring the house’s total
membership up to 65, and adds
that the house has a great deal of
money -in savings. Broaddus,

DIVEST, from p.1

But Ortmayer pointed out that,
“These businesses won’t do
that...divestmentis the next step.”

Ortmayer notes that, for these
same reasons, the Rev. Leon Sul-
livan is now calling for divest-
ment. Sullivan is the author of the
investment principles used by
most corporations in South Af-
rica. Sullivan recently disavowed
these principles, but the College
continues touse them, investing in
companies which rate in Category
III or higher.

Kaylor, another of the
resolution’s authors, stated that he
was somewhat optimistic that the
Trustees may react, considering
student and alumni pressure.

Kaylor concedes that if Davidson
does divest, “it is not likely to
make a great deal of difference”
for South Africa.

Kaylor said such a decision
would be a “statement of moral
principle” and, coupled with pres-
sure from the world community,
may eventually have some impact
on apartheid.

It was estimated that
Davidson’s investment in the 80
corporations in question were
worth $22 million in 1986.

The resolution was submitted
by faculty members Kaylor, Ort-

‘mayer, Peter Krentz, Charles

Ratliff, and Alan Singerman.

The resolution will be submit-
ted to the Trustees at their next
meeting, which will be held near
the end of February.

president of Warner Hall, ex-
plained that the house actually had
“no qualms” last year, due to its
money in savings and CDs. She
also expressed hope that students
will “realize what a crucially
valuable part of the campus PAX
(as a coed eating house) is.”

Phi Delta Theta, however, is
still working its way through
monetary troubles and is achiev-
ing some success, according to
treasurer Michael Taibi. Cer-
tainly, he said, this year’s Phi-Delt
pledge class was limited by the
new grade requirement, which
excluded “ten to fifteen” potential
pledges.

“Individually, we lost quite a
few due to the grade rule,” said
Taibi, who adds that the house is
making a few sacrifices in the
social budget, but seems to have
settled on a. plan to work out its
debt. He described the house,
which added six upperclassmen to
a list of ten freshman pledges, as
“stable.”

Kappa Sigma was the “big
winner” among the fraternities in
terms of number of freshman
pledges, adding twenty-nine
names toits rollsas aresult of self-
selection. Pi Kappa Alpha had the
next highest total, with twenty-
two freshmen joining its ranks.

Inits first year of existence after
a long absence from the campus,
Kappa Sigma gained all its
pledges through a “dry” rush.

Includes:

Rush Chairman Brian Gatchel
attributed the fraternity’s success
in pledge-hunting “basically to
dry rush. We didn’t hide behind
alcohol, and neither did the fresh-
men. Our rush was much more
personal. When you're drunk ata
party, youcan’treally get to know
anyone.” ,

Gatchel said that the Kappa
Sigs really made an effort to be-
come friends with the freshmen,
whom they met more often at
dinner than at parties.

Terry said that, overall, the self

selection system is running very
smoothly. He is pleased with the
positive results he has seen in the
past two freshman classes, which
have been kept off the court (and
out of rush) for the first weeks of
school.
Besides an improvement in
grades, Terry has seen good signs
on the freshman halls, which he
calls “more viable now.” He
explains, “The freshmen have to
look to each other at the first part
of the year, and this gives them a
better perspective of the Court.” .

a public utility. So, we have to

include all students or none.”
Because of lower ‘installation

fees and use of college WATS

lines, Stephenson said student —

telephone charges should be less
under the new system than when
students arrange their own service
as they currently do.

While the college will maintain
the wiring inside dormitories and
the telephonecompany will main-
tain it between buildings,
Stephenson said students will be
responsible for supplying their
own telephone sets. Dormitories
will be wired sometime in August.

Telephone numbers will be
assigned permanently to student
rooms rather than to individuals.
So, students will know their tele-

phone numbers as soon as they
know their room numbers. They
can dial other students or faculty
and staff with a four digit number,
and will have to dial “9” to get an
outside line.

Stephenson also said ESSX
(sm) will put the college on the
cutting edge of telephone technol-
ogy.

The system may, in the future,
be able to handle data transmis-
sion so that students could dial up
the college mainframe computer
with no special wiring.

Consideration of a new system
has been underway for several
years. According to Stephenson,
the ESSX (sm) option was pre-
sented to top administrative offi-
cers at their Charlotte budget re-
treat earlier in the month and they
approved it. The contract was
signed two weeks ago.
