should be done away with, unless
its advantages can be shown. Most
students would not use the three

Joe Gammon, Junior:

“Why should we be able to at-
tend any other games and get sin-
gle cuts, but them doubled

John Hay, Sophomore:

“IT do not like the double cut
system at all. When our football

teams play games away from here,
the only real support they have is
the band. The boys playing need

were conducted as research for the

In their work along this line,
Profs. Fulcher and Thies made
tests on -about two thousand bot-

of internal pressures exerted by a
group of beverages-including Coca

maximum amount of external pres-

Winston Salem Minister
ChooseS For Subject
“What Is God Like?”

Dr. J. R. Cunningham, pas-
tor of the First Presbyterian
Church in Winston - Salem
Was the speaker at last Sun-
| day’s vesper services in Cham-
bers auditorium, Dr. Cunning-
ham formerly held the posi-
tion of President of the Pres-

byterian Theological Semin-
ary in Louisville, Ky,
Text From John
Dr. Cunningham took as the
topic of his message the question,
“What Is God Like?" His text,
found in John 14, answers this ques-
tion: “He that hath seen me hath
seen the Father.” This is the re-
ply which Jesus gives to Philip's
demand, “Lord, show us the Fath-
er.” Dr. Cunningham said that
people everywhere ask the ques-
tion: “Who Is God? What is He
like? Is He personal? Does He
care a@ything about me? How can
1 find Him? How will I know
when I have found Him?" Many

think Him a celestial king, seated

on a heavenly throne; others, a

grandiatherly person, as in “Green

Pastures.” One cult supposes the
trees, streams, -and—nature—to—be
God. Another group say they find

God by doing good works.
Questions Answered
