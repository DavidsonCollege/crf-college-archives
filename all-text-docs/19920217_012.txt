Antigone

Continued from page 10

a very vital part in this production
as they add much tothe storyline as
well as provide most of the music
and dance.

Three international students are
in thecast: Christina Lopez-Ibanez
from Guatemala, Constanza Jar-
amillo from Columbia, and Kathar-
ina Altpeter from Germany. Addi-

tionally, two younger chorus ©
"members are from the Davidson

community and add variation to
the chorus. Elizabeth Thornberry
is a student at Davidson Elemen-
tary School, and Tate Gardner is in
eighth grade and is the son of Dr.
Joe Gardner, faculty member.

In order to view this produc-
tion of Antigone which promises
to be most interesting and filled
with multi-talented actors, come
to any of the following nights of
performance: February 20-22 and
27-29. All shows begin at 8:00
p.m., and the location is Hodson
Hall/Cunningham Fine Arts Cen-
ter.

chart-topping song, is overvthelm-
ing. Diffie will be a strong ‘Con,

tender for next year’s Horizon

award; he has many big songs al-
ready. I might not rank him here
on personal preference, but his
popularity makes and talent justify
his receiving this “honor”.

10. Ronnie Milsap -- Anodd
choice to round out the top ten, but
after almost 40 number ones,
Milsap is still going strong. His
live performances are among the
best I’ve ever seen (in any format
of music).. He still makes great
music, and he still sells records.
He deserves to be recognized for
his many contributions to the field.

So, there we have it. What
about Lionel’ Cartright, Mark
Chesnutt, and all the others? Well,
take your pick; thenumber of strong
male performers vying for the top
spot is ever-growing, It’s really
hard to go wrong with many of
them; but, as I see it, these are ten
of the biggest around today.
