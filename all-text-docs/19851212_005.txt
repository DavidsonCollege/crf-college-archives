Awareness weekend teaches ministry skills

By AARON LEVINE

Last weekend, approximately
25 Davidson students spent an
“Awareness Weekend” working
with Charlotte’s poor, homeless,
and needy through several inner-
city ministries. In its third year,
the weekend provides an opportu-
nity for students to learn about the
Christian ministry to the poor.

College Chaplain Charles
Summers said: “At the beginning
of the Christmas season, there are
a lot of people who are not having
their basic needs met. The stu-

dents benefit from having a good
sense that they are doing some-
thing worthwhile. Some of the
students have never been to an
inner city and this is their first ex-
posure to the problems there.”
Junior Steve Baggarly, a par-
ticipant in last year’s “Awareness
Weekend”, said, “Any interaction
with people different from ourse-
Ives is priceless because we need
to appreciate differences and un-
derlying similarities.” He added
that one can not actually love
someone one does not know.

Senior Ellen Oerter, another
participant in this year’s Aware-
ness Weekend, emphasized the
importance of the Habitat for Hu-
manity program which aids the
homeless. Student participants
spent part of their time repairing
houses. She said, “Habitat for Hu-
manity has perceived that lack of
home ownership has been a prob-
lem, and creates other problems.”
One problem is a lack of control
that the needy may feel when they
are renting from a landlord who
can easily evict them. Owning

their own home would give these
people a sense of contro].

Senior Rick Boden said, “I
went because I desire to minister
to numerous needs of the poor and
oppressed.” He added, “Jesus
calls us to use our talents to serve
others around us.”

Senior Kar] Lorenz said he got
to know those who went better
than he knew them before. He said
“Christ commits us to this ser-
vice.” He said that effecting
change is often relegated to vot-
ing; instead, one should give of

Phonathon gets students involved

By MARGOT MIMS

This year’s SGA phonathon is
a fundraiser involving over 20
hours of phone calling and over
300 students.

The emphasis has changed
this year, according to Living En-
dowment Director Gracia Slater
and phonathon director Hunter
Roddey ’85. They stressed the im-
portance of increases in individual
donations and of attracting new
donors, rather than an increase in
a total dollar goal.

“Of the $55,000 we have
raised over the first four nights,

$22,000 of that is new money,”
Roddey said. “This may serve as a
better indicator of how well we are
doing.”

An increase in total dollars
raised is not expected this year.
According to Gracia Slater it is not
a serious concern. “The dollar

amount is not as high this year be-
cause we are in better shape going
into the phonathon,” she said.
“Some people have increased
what they’re giving, which is
more exciting to us.”

Because some alumni now
contact annual donors, there are
fewer donors to be contacted by
phone. “The pool is not as large
this year, but returns are better be-
cause you are calling people who
are less likely to have been con-
tacted before,” Slater said.

Appealing to many is the fact
that it is the Davidson student who
is calling potential donors. SGA-
appointed sophomore Dave
Handy, and juniors Christi Hayes
and Mark Sandy serve as the co-
chairpersons of the 1985
phonathon. Sandy believed “the
donors are much more responsive
to the students than they would be
with people not presently as-

sociated with the college.”

The student-run phonathon al-
lows the alumni and parents to
keep in touch with the activities
going on at Davidson. Slater said,
“Davidson students are our main
asset and that’s why we are here.”

The phonathon was estab-
lished in the fall of 1980. David
Waddill ’81 submitted a proposal
for a phonathon to Lee Willin-
gham, director of the Living En-
dowment at that time. Willin-
gham, impressed by Waddill’s ea-
gerness to raise funds for a new
fieldhouse/gymnasium, agreed to
incorporate the program.

Cameron Chalmers, a sopho-
more phonathon volunteer, re-
flected on her first few days: “It is
a good way for students to not
only do a social service for David-
son, but also to have fun.”

Officer realizes boyhood aspiration

By TREEBY WILLIAMSON

As a boy growing up in Davidson,

Wayne King always wanted to be a police-
man. With thirteen years as a policeman be-
hind him already and six years before that as
a prison guard, Davidson College Police
Sergeant Wayne King has certainly realized

his boyhood ambition.

In his career as a prison guard and police
officer, King has experienced various life-

threatening situations. While a guard with

the North Carolina Prison Department, he
was once assaulted by prisoners.

Though his career as a policeman has
not been quite so violent, it still poses risks.
On one occasion a suspect pulled a gun on

problems.

him. Nevertheless, King feels his efforts

are rewarded when he apprehends a crimi-

nal.

As a Davidson College police officer,

King seeks to gain students’ confidence by
meeting and encouraging them to feel com-
fortable in contacting and making use of
Davidson security if necessary. Most stu-
dents, according to King, accept the pre-
sence of the campus police without causing

King echoes the advice of many before
him when he states the necessity for stu-
dents to lock their doors and protect valu-

dowment, which provides ten per-
cent of the budget. Figures reveal
a 21 percent increase from 1982 to
1983 in the total amount of money
raised and an increase of 33 per-
cent from 1983 to 1984. These
funds support academic affairs

King, are simply not aware of the very real
possibility of theft. However, the addition
of a crime prevention officer has increased
student awareness, in King's opinion.

McKelway discusses Christianity in South Africa

By ANDREA GROSS

Davidson religion professor
Alexander McKelway returned
Friday Dec. 6 from a two-week
trip to South Africa. McKelway
was one of a nine-member group
of political scientists and
educators headed by William
Jackson who made the journey.

Jackson is a former Davidson
faculty member who is now co-di-
rector of the Fulbright Institute for
Foreign Affairs at the University
of Arkansas.

McKelway was most struck
during his visit by “police brutal-
ity and violence.” He describes
the police as “out of control” and
repeatedly encountered stories of
the torturing of suspects and de-
tainment for no justifiable reason.

He mentioned that although
the South Africa foundation had

hoped that his group would end
their journey convinced that

economic sanctions against the
nation, such as disinvestment, are
only detrimental to efforts to end
apartheid, neither he nor most
other members of his delegation
are convinced that this is so.

He also feels that the military
power of “White South African
Society” makes thought of any
imminent black revolution impos-
sible. However, he stressed the
fact that while his trip left him
with a “deeper, more vivid sense
of the situation” in South Africa,
he did not in any way become an
expert in the area’s politics.

The South Africa Foundation,
a group of progressive business
people who oppose apartheid and
urge rapid governmental reforms,
including majority role, spon-
sored the trip.

McKelway described his trip
as an “intensive series of semi-
nars.” The theologian, along with

the rest of the delegation, met with
military, church, black township
and government leaders, newspa-
per personnel and business people
including a Mr. Relly, Chairman
of the Anglo-American Com-
pany, the largest business enter-
prise in South Africa.

The dialogues, which ranged
over a variety of topics including
Christology and the relevance of
Christianity to blacks’ struggles,
took place all over South Africa in
cities such as Johannesburg and
Cape Town and, black townships
such as Crossroads and Sobeto, a
community of four to six million
blacks outside of Johannesburg.
The group also visited Nambia
and Angola.

McKelway had discussions
with Nico Smith, a white Dutch
Reformed Thenlogian and minis-
ter to a parish in Mamelodi, a
township outside of Pretoria

where women and children were
killed in fighting three weeks ago;
John de Gruchy, an important
theologian at the University of
Capetown, and James Andrews,
stated Clerk (Chief Executive) of
the Presbyterian Church in the
United States of America.

In his talks with Smith,
McKelway learned more about
the Dutch Reformed Church of the
late "30s and '40s, who created the
doctrine of apartheid. Smith des-
cribed apartheid in the context of
the Afrikaners who took over
when the British left South Africa
in 1948. At this time, apartheid
was constitutional in order to ad-
vance Afrikaner political and
economic power.

With de Gruchy, McKelway
discussed important political ac-
tivity among students involved in
protests at The University of
Capetown. The University, South

Africa’s oldest, is to some extent
integrated, admitting small num-
bers of blacks, colored and In-
dians. McKelway met with James
Andrews in Harase, the capital of
Zimbabwe, where an emergency
meeting of the World Council of
Churches was in session to discuss
the South African situation.

While in Harase, McKelway
also sat in on the council's
dialogue of Thursday, Dec. 5. and
attended a communion service in
the city’s Cathedral.

Although the group may meet
again in late January, they do not
plan any more tnps together to
South Africa. McKelway plans to
write some articles about the
church and the theological side ot
his discussions

He will be speaking at David-
son about his trip sometime in
early January.
