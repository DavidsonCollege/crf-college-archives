THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 24, 1920.

DR. FRAZER HOOD, A DISTINCT
ADDITION TO DAVIDSON'S
FACUL

.

Prominent Professor Comes to

Occupy C. E. Graham Chair
of Psychology.

“Who's who in rica” intro-
duces Dr. Frazer Hood to us as a
psychologist. His eminent qualifi-
cations to fill the C. E. Graham
Chair of Education and Psychology

needs no further sanction of words.
A man cultured and trained by long
years of university study, a profes-
sor whose continuous experience is
measured by decades; he is a sci-
entist among the best in the land;
truly a man among men. Southern
born and the holder of a degree
from a Southern Presbyterian Col-
lege, we are assured that he is in
sympathy with the ideals of such a
college as Davidson.

Tupelo, Miss., claims him as her
own by right of birth, and South-
western Presbyterian University of
Clarksville, Tenn., by right of adop-
tion. He was graduated from that
institution in 1896 with the degree
of B.A. During the year 1898-1899
he was a student in Johns Hopkins
University. At the dawn of the
twentieth century he held a mas-
ter’s degree from Yale University,
and this same institution made him
a doctor of Philosophy two years
later.

He has held the following profes-
sorships: Ethics and English Lit-
erature, Hanover (Ind.) College,
1902-1903; Psychology, University
of Oklahoma, 1903-1904; the Chair
of Psychology for a number of
years in The West Tennessee State
Normal School; while he comes
direct to us from Northwestern
University, Chicago. At the last
named institution he was director of
the School of Salesmanship. During
the Great War Dr. Hood served in
the psychological department of the
United States army.

In a day when individualism
counts .most Dr. Hood is pre-em-
inently a specialist. His two chief
interests are the psychology of the
child, and the psychology of busi-
ness. He is looking forward to the
day when the broadening of the de-
partment of psychology will allow
him to give at Davidson a course
dealing with the psychology of
business. ,

But Dr. Hood’s distinctions are
not limited to his attainment in re-
search, nor to his experience as an
instructor. Besides contributing to
various reviews, he was author in
1917 of “A Manual of Psychology
Every Parent Ought to Know.” He
is a member of several fraternal
being a Kappa Alpha, a
Mason, and an Odd Fellow.

Again Davidson finds herself par-
ticularly fortunate. We are glad
that Dr. Hood is here.

R. O. T. C. NEWS.

The R. O. T. C. Armory has been
during the past week, alive with

m(cadet officers, non-coms and pri-
E|vates, drawing clothing and equip-
=|ment. By the time this issue of the

Davidsonian goes to press, every-

z (one will be fitted out and ready to
m\take his place in Captain Hearn’s

Little Army.

Nearly all the uniforms are new
and they are above the average in
neatness. Much credit is due Ser-
geant Johnson who made special
measurements. A special feature of
the uniform is the so-called “Dinky
little cap.” When these made their
first appearance on the Hill they
caused a general stampede.

Sergeant Johnson came out to in-
spect the bulletin board and was al-
most scared out of his wits by a
Lieutenant, who upon closer ob-
servation turned out to be a cadet
in uniform. Some of the profes-
sors also proved victims of curious-
ity and astonishment when they
were caught scanning the features
underneath the visor of a R. O. T.C.
cap, only to behold a modest and
well-meaning freshman.

A baseball game was in full
swing in front of Phi Hall, but when
a uniform containing a junior pass-
ed by, everyone forgot the game
temporarily, and turned round to
enquire, “Where did you get that
hat?”

CAMPUSISMS.

Mr. Robert Chaffin, of Lumber-
ton, N. C., visited his daughter, Mrs.
F. L. Jackson for several days last
week,

Miss Sarah Lingle, daughter of
Dr. Thomas Lingle, has returned to
Winston-Salem to resume her
studies at historic Salem College.

“Friend” Wilson visited the Hill
for a few days last week. Last
ycar “Friend” ran the Commissary ;
right off the bat he investigated the
new Commissary: “They’ve got me
skinned a mile, $1.50 for Fresh caps,
Wowie!”

Smith Murphy, '22, and A. E. Fra-
leigh, '22, dropped in Sunday to
visit friends for a few days. Murphy
and Fraleigh are on their way to
Princeton University to take the
regular literary course. Trying to
do the Woodrow Wilson stunt, eh?

Dr. G. H. Cartledge, ’11, spent a
few days on the Hill last week.
After graduating at old Davidson
with high honors Dr. Cartledge
taught at P. C. for two years. Then
his old Alma Mater called him to be
assistant professor of physics and
chemistry; he remained here for
one year, but in that short time he
showed himself to be a thorough
master of his subjects and a most
efficient teacher. Leaving David-
son Dr. Cartledge entered the com-
mercial field, working in many of
the great munition factories of the
north. Dr. Cartledge has given up
commercial work and has accepted
a position with the Department of
Chemistry of Johns Hopkins.

T. H. Spence’s voice was heard
again last week. T.H. spent a few
hours on the Hill’ Saturday in the
interests of his school. He _ is
now professor of history and
(think a minute) at Oak Ridge. His
old team-mate, “L, '12,” is teaching
math and Latin in a private school in
N’Orleans.

.

H. W. Davenport, ’19, gave his old
Alma Mater a look-over last week.
He is now in Farmville, N.C., en-
gaged in the cotton business; while
here he was a famous forward on
the varsity basketball team.

Chapel in another building as a
regular thing for the first time in
eighty-four (2) years.

Warren Cox, A. P. Hudgins and
Zeb Morris were more or less sick
some day last week. Too many
green

Late Monday evening: 488 men
have registered.

OLD COMMENCEMENT HALL
NOW USED AS CHAPEL

Chapel has heretofore been held
in Shearer Hall, but on account of
the increased enrollment this year
it has been found necessary to
change to the old commencement
hall in Chambers building.

The seats were numbered the first
part of the week, but the paint still
being in a state of liquidity and
rather than brand everybody’s shirt
with a number, it was decided best
to remain in Shearer Hall four or
five days longer.

The different classes are to be
seated as follows in the old hall:

The Freshmen are to occupy the
first five rows extending all the way
across the hall; the Sophomores fill-
ing the next four rows behind them;
the Juniors taking the middle teft
hand block and the Seniors the right
hand block. In this manner the
whole student body can be seated
and not crowded together as in
Shearer Hall.
