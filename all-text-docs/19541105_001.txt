Eu Society Chooses [PHI SOCIETY MEETS

Dick As Treasurer

Monday night, November 1,
marked the second meeting of the
Eumanean Literary Society this
year. After the roll call, which
brought many humorous and en-
lightening quotations, and reading
of the previous meeting's minutes,
a new treasurer was elected. Henry
Brockmann was compelled by a
conflicting schedule to relinquish
his duty as treasurer. Tony Dick
replaced Brockmann as treasurer.

Tim Cooper, president of the
society, delivered his opening ad-
dress expressing appreciation for
the support given to him in elect-
ing him president. Promising ef-
fective leadership, Cooper outlined
briefly his plans for a more en-
lightening and cultivating program
for the society. He called for sup-
port of every member to enhance
the benefits of this new program.

The program for the meeting in-
cluded Tom Morgan’s reading of
“The Disappearance of Liberal
Edication,” an essay. by Robert
Hutchins. The members divided
then into two groups to compete
in an “Old Fashion Spelling Bee.”
The evening was concluded with
the spelling bee, as the teams
fought to a draw.

DEPP WILL SPEAK
AT VESPERS SUNDAY

The Reverend Mark Depp, D.D.,
pastor of the Centenary Methodist
Church, Winston-Salem, N. C., will
be the speaker this Sunday at
Vespers.

Dr. Depp, a native of Pennsyl-
vania, is known throughout the

South as an outstanding speaker
and minister. He serves as pastor

of one of the largest Methodist
churches in the country.
Dr. Depp graduated from Alle-

gheny College and completed his

seminary training at the Boston

University School of Theology. He
served as chaplain during the First
World War and afterwards held
several pastorates in Pennsylvania

and Maryland before coming to
Winston-Salem.

No stranger to Davidson, Dr.
Depp proved himself a stimulating
and inspirational speaker when he
spoke at the 1950 Fall Services

on the theme “Faith That Lives.”

Miss Deneke Visits
Cummings’ Tonight

Margaret Deneke, Choirmaster
at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford,
and at one time on Albert Sch.
weitzer’s staff, will be entertain-
ed at the home of Mrs. W. P. Cum-
ming on the night and evening of
Friday, November 5. Miss Deneke
is on her sixth annual speaking
tour of the United States in be-

Ann’s College, Oxford, of which

able collection of music manu-
scripts from the Mendelssohn fam-
ily as a tribute to her work in be-
half of music.

Murray Wins Oxford First Honors

Joseph J. Murray, Davidson '51,* —

and a Rhodes Scholar, graduated | -

with first class Honors in the
School of Zoology at the end of
‘Trinity term last summer. He is-at
present on a British expedition in
Nepal, exploring the approaches
to a new peak in the Himalayas.

Murray’s achievement in making
a first class at Oxford is impres-
sive, since very few Americans and
no other Davidsonians (so far as
local records show) have made that
rank. An Oxford saying is “Firsts
are born, not made;” a very able
student, by steady application, can
make a second, but first8 are given
only to those who have demonstrat-
ed on their final exafninations a
special quality of brilliance.

Oxford and Cambridge form the
apogee of the educational system
of the British Commonwealth of
half a billion people and have no
parallel in the American pedago-
gical structure.

At Davidson, Murray not only
was an excellent biology ‘student
but also showed virtuosity in such
subjects as the poetry of Hous-
man and folk bailadry of the Ap
palachian mountaineers, which he

mo:

had made the subject of first-hand
study.

The following account is taken
from The American Oxonlan, Oc-
tober 1954, page 255:

“Jim Murray performed the pro-
digious feat of rowing for Merton
in Eights Week, getting a first in
Zoology, and setting off immediate-
ly with the Oxford University Ex-
pedition for Nepal. The primary
object of the expedition is to study

~~ “tthe approaches to Mt. Saipal, ex-

ploring territory never seen by a
foreigner until this Spring. Mur-
Yay expects to return by Novem-
ber, in time for the December
quota of the Lexington, Virginia,
draft board.”

" Murray’s reputation as an intre-
pid and skilliul climber is indicat-
ed by the following extract from
a letter written to Davidson from
a fellow-student at Oxford recent.
ly:

“Jim has received national fame,
incognito. As you know, Tom Tow-
er of Christ Church has always
been the Everest of Oxford. Well,
Jim and an English student climb-
ed it during vacation. Jim put a
small Confederate flag there.

“Since there are University regu-
lations against climbing the build-
ings, not too many people know
who did it, but the feat itself was
proclaimed in several newspapers
and over BBC. I understand that
one of the men who assisted Hunt
on Everest failed in an attempt
when he was an undergraduate
here and later said that it was
impossible to climb.”

Court Cracks Down On

Disobedient

Harry Petersen, judge of the
Court of Control, announced this
week a Court decision to restrict
200 members of the freshman class
to the campus for seven days be-
gining next Monday.

The order came as a result of
the poor showing made by fresh-
men on the recent test of the stu-
dent body constitution and fresh-
man regulations. This test was giv-
en by the freshman advisors, who
subsequently turned the failures
over to the Court of Control.

A retest will be given on Satur-
day night during the “campus”
period at 9 PM at the College
Union for all freshmen who flunk-
ed the previous test. Repeat fail-
ures will be dealt with strongly
by the Court. °

All freshmen except those few
who received a passing grade on
the first test will be required to
remain on the campus from 9 a.m,
Monday, November 8, through the
following Monday, November 15.

Petersen“ pointed out that the
“campus” includes only the
grounds of the college. Any fresh-
men found off the campus other
than at the Post Office, which they
are allowed to visit, twice daily,
will receive stern punishment from
the Court.

Freshmen tried in Monday
night's Court session and found
guilty of failure to know the fresh-
man regulations, of not wearing
beanies, and of other offenses have
been required to wear plaques

Freshman-Parents’
Day Here Tomorrow

The second annual Freshman-
Parents’ Day will be observed at
Davidson tomorrow, November 6.

Registration will take place in
the lobby of the College Union be-
tween the hours of 9 and 11 in the
morning. Parents will secure meal
tickets and name tags, which will
also serve as tickets for the foot-
ball game .in the afternoon. Stu-
dents will be available to take
parents on tours of the campus,
if they desire such service.

At 11 o'clock freshmen and par-
ents will assemble in the ball room
of the Union. Dr. Cunningham will
welcome the guests to the campus,
after which members of the ad-
ministration and faculty will be in-
troduced, and the male chorus will
render several selections.

"Dean Spencer will talk to the
group about “Problems of Col-
lege Freshmen”, and a question
and answer period will follow this
address.

Lunch will be served in the
Union between the hours of 12
and 1:45, and the next item on the
program is the football game be-
tween Davidson and Catawba. Par-
ents will sit with their sons in
the student section during the

game.

After the ball game, a Faculty-
Parent reception will be held in
the Ball Room of the Union. This
reception is the last item on the
program. — .

Arrangements have been made
to provide lodging for those par-
ents who wish to spend the night.

The entire program has been ar-
ranged by freshmen under the
leadership of Mr. Shaw Smith.
Lioyd Chapin of Atlanta, Ga., is
serving as chairman of the com-
mittee. Bill Pomeroy, Waycross,
Ga., is in charge of invitations;
Jim Jones, Charlotte, is in charge
of publicity; Mike Martin, David-
son, is in charge of lunch and
lodging arrangements.

ing Episcopalian students on the

bearing the offense, to wear name
tags, to remain on the campus, to
wear coats and ties, and to write
themes ranging from 175 to 3200
words concerning the freshman
regulations.

The purpose of the latter punish-
ment, Petersen said, is to get an
indication of the freshman attitude
toward the regulations and gen-
eral policy of the Court. The judge
commented, “So far, the response
in these themes has been very
good and the majority have felt
the regulations have a good point
and are necessary.”

The Court of Control reminds
freshmen that all rules are still
to be strictly obeyed. Petersen said
members of the Court are attempt-
ing to rigidly enforce the regula-
tions; he continued, “With the
cooperation of the entire student
body the Court can develop a good
freshman class.”

Members of the Court request
that charges by upperclassmen
against freshman violators be turn-
ed to.them as quickly as possible.
Any report will be considered at
once; the Court meets about twice
every ten days.

and their campus addresses are:
