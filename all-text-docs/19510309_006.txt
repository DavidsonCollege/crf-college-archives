POST ARTICLE FEATURES STATE
BASKETBALL GROWTH, SUCCESS

North Carolina State College's
famed basketball team and _ its
coach, Everett Case, will be fea-
tured in the March 10 issue of
The Saturday Evening Post.

Accompanied by two illustra-
tions, the article is entitled “Bas-
ketball Bug Bites Dixie.” The mag-
azine will go on sale at the nation’s
news stands on Wednesday, March
7.

The story, written by Sports
Editor Harry T. Paxton of The
Post, will trace N. C. State’s rise
to national fame on the cage courts.
Attendance at the Wolfpack games
during the 1949-50 season, Editor
Paxton explains in his article, was
the biggest in the United States.

In his feature, Editor Paxton
tells about State College’s work in
obtaining Everett Case as its bas-
ketball coach, outlines plans which
culminated in the construction of

Abolition Of Bull-

In Favor Of Dorm Room Discussions

By BILL ELLIOTT

As a result of nightly discussions
of the lack of facilities for enter-
tainmest on the campus, a very
pertinent question has arisen. Is
there any reason why one cannot
entertain in a dormitory room? Af-
ter ponderine and musing over the
subject for several evenings, this
writer was prompted to investigate
the possibility further.

After examination of the exist-
ing regulations, 1 am reasonably
sure that good, wholesome enter-
tainment is possible and permitted.
Perhaps, the in-bred rules of pro-
priety in the Davidson student has
kept this practice from becoming
common on the campus, if anyone
has even thought of this aspect of
campus life before. It is now my
belief that it would be the most
novel and best means of entertain.
ing. At least until the Student Un.
fon becomes a reality, the idea of-
fers great possibilities. It opens up
a vast field which is undoubtedly
unexplored by the socially inclined.

Just think how delightful jis the
possibility. of having friends drop-
ping in for an evening of informal
discussion and __ stimulating talk.
The intellectual life of the campus
would receive a tremendous shot
in the arm, An intelligentsia would
flourish in these conditions. Even
modest furnishings such as easy
chairs, lounges, and a serving set
would be a boon to the movement.
Eventually, such groups with cho-
sen subjects and selected partici.
pants might replace the vulgar bull.

the institution's brilliant athletes,
including Sam Ranzino, and offers
comment by Dr. H. A. Fisher,
chairman of the N. C. State Athletic
Council.

He reviews Coach Case's amaz-
ing record as a coach, describes
the crowds which turn out for
State College's home games, and
tells of the soaring interest in bas-
ketball throughout North Carolina
from the backhoards which have
been erected on barns and trees in
the rural areas to the thrilling con-
tests held in the Coliseum.

Writer Paxton also turns his at-
tention to State College's other

gained for its friendliness and hos-
pitality would be even better if
this practice should become a tra-
dition to take its place along with
other unique traditions found here.
On such occasions as dance-
weekends, the facilities of the
school would be greatly increased.
Of course, the usual rules of pro.
priety would be observed and in
keeping with the policies of the
institution, a curfew would be en.
acted.

This .custom is common on other
campuses and definite results a.e
evident. Certainly, if it were begun
here, marked changes would be
noted in the social and intellectual
life of the school. Perhaps, this is
the answer to the problems of sti-
mulating the intellect and drawing
us all together in intellectual com-
panionship while inducing students
to remain on the campus more.

“That he’s twenty-one, single, and

Comic books should be used in
American schools, an educator, Hu.
bert G. Williams, believes. His rec-
ommendations are made in a the-
sis accepted at Bowling Green
State University in partial fulfill-
ment of the requirements for the
degree of master of arts.

“Comics are an integral part of

-{our culture and consequently can.

hot be ignored by educators,” de.
clares Mr. Williams, who is head
of the English department at Law-
rence Institute of Technology,
“The comics provide a basis for
learning history, geography and sci-
ence in a natural and personal set-
ting.”

How can comics be used effec.
tively in the classroom? Mr. Wil-
liams answers the question by list-
ing these fields and making these
comments: Reading readiness—
Animal comics offer a wide and
varied library at small cost; Reme-
dial reading—Since the interest
level of the comics is high and the
vocabulary level low, they would
seem to contain all the qualifica.
tions for material in this field; Cre-
ative writing - Comics help the
young pupil familiarize himself with
organization and the idea of a cen.
tral theme,

“The. advantages of better books
can be shown,” he adds. “There
should be careful guidance to bet-
ter forms of children’s literature.

“Incorporation of comic books
in the educational material does not.

.{mean a lowering of our standards,

any more than the use of the prim.
er or nursery rhymes represents the
ultimate in reading taste.

“The evils of the art work in
comics cannot be mitigated. The
artistic approach and technique
and the content material can only
be bettered by education and great-
er art appreciation.”

Forbidding comics enhance their
glamour and promotes interest in
them, Williams quotes students of
children’s literature as having said.
Comprehension and enjoyment of
the comics is at the fourth grade
level, according to his study of two
copies each of Superman, Batman,
Detective Comics, Action Comics,
Star Spangled Comics and Boy
Commandos.

The thesis writer points out that
the Falk School of the University of
Pittsburgh admits comics as text-
book material in all grades from
the first to the 12th.

Fordham Institutes
Honors Courses For
Brainy Sophomores

The College ot Arts and Sciences
at Fordham University has insti-.
tuted an Honors Program which
begins in the sophomore year and
carries through to graduation. The
program leads to a special honors
degree, It is provided for those stu-
dents who have shown great ability
and maturity in their first year at
college. .

According to the plan, the high.
est averages ‘are creamed off the
top of the class at the end of the
freshman year. From them the
Honors Students are chosen after
an intensive program of tests and
interviews. During the sophomore
year, these outstanding students
are obliged to attend. in addition to
their regular courses, three hours
of lecture weekly on the History
of Art, as well as a weekly seminar
on the great literatures and the de.
termining movements that have
shaped the civilization of the West.

Seminar lectures are conducted
by experts in the fields of litera-
ture, philosophy: politics, and the
social sciences, The teaching staff
of the Graduate School and Col-
lege contributes its services to
keep these seminars on a high in.
tellectual level. Students are obliged
to read on the topics treated, and
quarterly papers written by them
are used as an index of the devel.
opment of their critical faculties
and their powers of assimilation.

In the junior year, the student
is excused from all except certain
required classes and is put directly
under the care of the mentor. It is
hoped that arrangements may soon
be concluded by which Honors
Students may spend a year abroad
with full college credit.
