Smith's Interception
Preserves Victory

Over Colonels
‘Cats Up Record to 4-5

By Chris Hood

Richardson Field’s controls

Friday night, Davidson almost self-
destructed with penalties and kicker
Drew Fassett missed the game with
an injury. No wonder head coach
Dave Fagg called the Wildcats’
10-3 victory over Centre College
Saturday “probably the ugliest,
most wonderful win I’ve ever seen
here.”

Davidson, now 4-5, survived
a late drive by the Colonels when
comerback Alden Smith inter-
cepted Chris Lyons in the end zone
with 10 seconds remaining in the
contest. Centre had driven from its
44 to the Davidson three and had
been aided by two defensive pen-
alties before Smith intervened to
record his second interception of
the afternoon.

field goals in Fassett’s absence;
fullback Bruce Bannister kicked

off, and tight end Tim Carrigan
handled punting duties. Benoist
outkicked Parks, and he put the
‘Cats on the board in the first quar-
ter with a 35-yard field goal.

“I'd kicked before in high
school, but never here,” Benoist
explained after the game. Ironi-
cally, Saturday’s match was the
final home game for Benoist and

‘the other Davidson seniors. “I was

shaking when it was time for me to
kick. I couldn’t stay still.”
Though the ‘Cats held the lead
for the rest of the quarter, Centre
added a field goal of its own with
6:56 remaining in the half. The
Colonels used over six minutes on
a 16-play, 57-yard drive which
ended with Evan Hjerpe’s 25-yard
field goal. Davidson had forced
the visitors to punt twice earlier in
the drive, but running into the
kicker and holding penalties kept
the ball in the Colonels’ hands.
After Hjerpe missed a 26-yard
field goal attempt in the third quar-

mM team celebrated Senior day No-

vember 1 with a 3-0 victory over
Appalachian State, the team’s sec-
ond shutout win over the Moun-
taineers this season.

Davidson dominated the first
half by not allowing App State
into its offensive circle. The ‘Cats
scored their first goal on a penalty
stroke by junior Erin Lang. She hit
the back crossbar with a shot to the
upper right hand corner before the
Mountaineer goalie could even
react. The goal helped Lang earn
honors as player of the game. _-

Later in the first half, senior
Jenny Plowright scored on the sec-
ond penalty stroke of the game
with a low passing shot to the left,

Bde also left the goalie helpless.

The final goal came from
freshman Nicole Ficeto in the sec-

* ond half and gave the Cats a 3-0

lead. Sophomore Mary Ferguson
held the Mountaineers scoreless in
the second half to preserve the
shutout. The victory completed an
undefeated (6-0-1) home season
for the Wildcats.

Men's Tennis Ends Fall Season
With Win in Davidson Tourney

By Brannon Buck

The Davidson men’s tennis
team, led by coach Jeff Frank and
captains Albie Varoski and Dave
Tonidandel, finished its fall sea-
son undefeated with a record, in-
cluding tournament victories, of 8-
0. Matches concluded the week-
end of October 30, with Davidson
;winning its own tournament by
defeating UNC-Greensboro and
The Citadel.

The Wildcats also won a tour-

namentin Spartanburg, S.C,a week
earlier by dominating teams from
Wofford, Presbyterian and
Furman. Coach Frank was pleased
with his team’s play throughout
the fall. “I felt that we got a good
effortoutofeveryone on the team,”
he said, “I was particularly pleased
with our doubles play, and I am
looking forward to cranking up for
the spring.”

The future should only be bet-
ter for the Wildcats, as three mem-

bers of the team who did not par-
ticipate in the fall will return in the
spring. Among them is David
Jesperson, who won the Big South
Conference Championship at the
number two position last year.

. Despite that outlook, though, Frank

stresses that the team has a lot of
work to do in order to prepare for a
spring season that includes several
top twenty opponents as well as a
season-opening tournament at
UNC Chapel Hill.
