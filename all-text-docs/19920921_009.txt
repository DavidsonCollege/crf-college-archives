The Environment

From the Left

‘Sara Carlson

When it comes to the environ-
ment, the “environmental presi-
dent” acts ignorantly. For George
Bush, saving the environment
means losing American jobs and a
conceding to tree-hugging demo-
crats. He fails to realize that new
technology brings along with it
new innovations and new indus-
tries to support the technology.

Will a raise in national auto
efficiency requirements to45 miles
per gallon devastate the U.S. auto
industry? Mr. Bush seems to think
so. He is campaigning in the in-
dustrial midwest on the premise
that American cars must be ineffi-
cient gas-guzzling goliaths to be
attractive on domestic and world
markets.

Al Gore and Bill Clinton sup-
porta raise in auto efficiency, and
rightly so. World demands are
slowly dragging the United States
out of the 1970’s Lincoln Conti-
nental and super-macho-musclecar
and into the 1990’s low emissions
efficiency vehicles. Not only do
the new cars save gasoline, but
they dramatically reduce the
American contribution to carbon
dioxide emissions, the major cause
of global warming. California is
leading the way with zero-emis-
sions requirements in mere de-
cades.

Rather than destroy the auto
industry, these new requirements
spark the American innovative

spirit. Companies are racing to
design faster, lighter electric cars
with longer battery staying power.
General Motors has already pro-
duced a prototype electric vehicle
with reasonable pickup. Sure, it
has to be recharged every couple
hundred miles, but it doesn’t have
to be fed ever more expensive and
precious petroleum products.

And what about nuclear
power? As plants become increas-
ingly unreliable and expensive to
maintain, power bills jump. There
is always that tiny problem as to
where to dump the radioactive by-
products from nuclear power pro-
duction. Clinton and Gore plan to
reduce nuclear reliance and in-
crease research into renewable
power sources, such as wind and
solarenergies. Again there is work-
ing precedent.

When Sacramento’s residents
voted by referendum to close the
Rancho SecoNuclear Power Plant,
county officials feared an increase
in power costs. Instead, power
costs have stabilized. Sacramento
Municipal Utility District (SMUD)
has done more than just close the
plant; they’ve invested in the fu-
ture. Painting roofs white, plant-
ing shade trees on the south sides
of buildings, and offering rebates
for energy-efficient refrigerators
will all help maintain lower power

From the Right

Senator gloom, Al Gore, has
made environmental policy his
central theme for the presidental

campaign. Hisrecentbook, Earth ~

in the Balance, explains his envi-
ronmental goals for the future.
Unfortunately, it is full of exag-
gerations and lies.

‘Al Gore began his environ-
mental crusade as an undergradu-
ate at Harvard. He studied the
work of the late Roger Revelle
who pioneered the study of atmo-
spheric carbon dioxide. Gore
credits much of his knowledge on
the theory of greenhouse warm-
ing to Revelle. But Gore fails to
cite in his book Revelle’s last, and
most complete study, of ozone
depletion which concludes, "The
scientific base for greenhouse
warming is too uncertain to jus-
tify drastic action at this time. —
There is little risk in delaying
policy responses.”

Gore instead cites a January

reportfrom NASA thatstatesthere |

is a “possible” ozone hole de-
tected over Antarctica. Gore de-
clared these findings, “an imme-
diate, acute emergency threat...
the single most important issue
facing this country and this Earth!”
But, in May, NASA refuted its
firstreport and admitted there was
noevidence of anozone hole form-
ing over the Northern Hemi-
sphere. So much for the “most
important issue facing the earth.”

Another Gore claim is that only
2 percent of credentialed research-
ers feel there is no greenhouse ef-
fect, but a recent Greenpeace sur-
vey of climatologists indicates that
47 percent feel that a runaway
greenhouse effect is nearly impos-
sible. Another 36 percent is unde-
cided which leaves only 13 per-
cent who said it was “probable”.

But Gore’s “best” exaggeration
occurs on page 24 of his book.
Gore has an “accelerated rate of
species extinction” graph that
shows how fast species are becom-
ing extinct. According to the data
in his graph, the Earth’s five mil-
lion or so species, including hu-
mans, will all be extinct before
2032!

The only truthful part of Gore’s
book appears to be his enormous
spending plan he proposes to
“save” the environment. Entitled
the Marshall Plan, Gore calls for a
$95 billion per year plan that would
be paid for with enormous tax in-
creases. The plan is aimed at hurt-
ing U.S. industries and would re-
duce economic growth by 1.4 per-
cent per year, and that’s no lie!

“Stnator PIOOM wants Nerp™
convert Bill Clinton into the “envi-
ronmental President.” Let’s hope
he doesn’t use his own book as the
basis. If so, Americans have more
to fear than ozone depletion.

SAE

Continued from page 8

for AIDS research, Amnesty Inter-
national, and world hunger, why
not play one at Davidson for the
expulsion of the “‘Not-so-nice-
guys?” “Sunday, Bloody Sunday”
could be rereleased asa single with
all the proceeds going to help the
extinction of this group from our
beloved campus. Stop the killing!

Is this campus desperately”

hunting for some sort of contro-
versy or what? College is sup-
posed to be fun. Shoot, we study
enough here to earn a little merri-
ment every now and then. I pre-
sume that the SAEs are feeling a
bit handcuffed right now. Butthen
again, we all are with the new
alcohol policy.

. So what can you do to make
the SAEs feel better? I propose we
form our own select committee-
and our first action will be to wel-

—comethe SAEs to Davidson as our

. newest minority.

Move over
FLAG, we need to make some
room for Davidson’s newest op-
pressed minority. To make them
feel like they belong, we should
start a “Hug a Hod” campaign.
They need lots of them, and it will
make you feel better, too. If feels
good, doesn’t it?

But seriously, let me reiterate
that I am not justifying the inci-
dents that happened last year for

which they are now paying the’

price. But more often than not, it

was not the SAEs who were
responsible but one or two SAEs
who were. I refuse to believe that
a group of people who are intelli-
gent enough to get in here would
fall under what is known in psy-
chology as “group think.”
Davidson is becoming notorious
for scapegoating all its problems
on one group when it really should
be focusing on the individuals who
constantly get in trouble.

Frampton Rules:
Stereotyping

Guys

According to the second col-
lege edition of the Webster's New
World Dictionary, the definition
of stereotype is as follows: an un-
varying form or pattern; a fixed or
conventional notion held by anum-
ber of people and allowing for no
individuality, critical judgement,
etc. To say the least, stereotypes
are dangerous, judgemental, ego-
tistical signs of stupidity.

Nonetheless, Iam going to go

Chris
Frampton

ahead and present four categories
of personality into which all guys
fall. (I think I can do this without

com@fLOnding,.ANYONE.NCCAUSC ADC...
Russians tell me I am guy.)

Everyone knows the first cat-
egory of guy. He is called “the
friend.” He is, as the name im-
plies, friends with every single girl
in the ‘world. They may be hot,
they may not be, it doesn’t matter,
he knows them.. If any guy wants
to meet some girl or needs a date to
some function and is too much ofa
loser to actually introduce himself
to one, he calls “the friend.” Ifa
girl has just been dumped or some
other pseudo-trauma like that, she
can talk to “the friend” for hours.
He will give great advice and lots
of hugs. (Please don’t think this
means she’ll pay any attention to

- his advice.) Essentially, he is a
cute, nice guy, which, when added °
up, means he can’t get a date for
himself, and hasn’t gotten any play
in about three or four years.

The flip side of this, of course,
is “the cheese.” Again, everyone
knows him. The best words to
_describe him would be, depending
on your point of view, “revered” or

“notorious.” The guys all love to
tell tales of his exploits and con-
quests. Heisknowntohave bagged
so and so and it is only a matter of
time before he hooks up with what’s
her name. The girls warn each
incoming freshwoman about him
the first chance they get.

See if this image might fit:
“the cheese” stands on top of a
table, dancing alone, some type of
gyration, and he eyes some vicitm
across the room. In the corner
stand four guys, watching and

. punching each other in the shoul-
der, ““He’s goin’ to bag her, dude!”
