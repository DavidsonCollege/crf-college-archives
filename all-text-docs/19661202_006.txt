Martin Reaps Reward
Of Campaign Monday

Dr. Jim Martin, associate pro-
fessor of chemistry. will offi-
cially take office Monday in his
first term as a Mecklenburg
County Commissioner.

Martin was elected Nov. 3 with
three other Republicans, giving
Mecklenburg County its first Re-
publican-controlled commission
since Reconstruction. He termed
the four to one majority some-
what ‘‘unexpected.”

The Republican victories in
Mecklenburg County were at-
tributed to several things by
Mart'u. Except for the David-
son precinct and a few others,
Martin felt that the Republicans
had more aggressive and effi-
cient county-wide organization
than the Democrats.

He cited the fact that. in many
predominantly Republican pre-
cinets 80 per cent of the voters
turned out, compared with a
much lower turnout in the 1964
présidential election. In the
dominantly Democratic precincts
only 30 per cent of the voters
who voted in the 1964 election
were turning out cn election day.

The changes in plans were
caused by complications arising

participants in the theater could

This year’s club was to have

The exact dates for the re-

Former Davidsonian
(Spoofs Speaker Ban

A University of North Caro-
lina at Chapel Hill senior, who
transferred from Davidson Col-
lege last year, has voiced his
personal protest against North
Carolina’s controversial ‘“Speak-
er Ban” by recording a ‘‘ballad
bombing the ban,’ according to
a story in the Dally Tar Heel.

Bill Dale, a senior English
major at UNC, first sang his
“Speaker Ban Ballad’ at UNC
on Nov. 19. Speaking out against
the state legislature prohibiting
any Communist or person who
has taken the Fifth Amendment
from speaking at a state college,
Dale plans to release his record

'1 in early December.

“‘The Speaker Ban Ballad’
is my only protest song,” Dale
said, and ‘‘we are pushing it on
the campuses throughout the
state . . . to stimulate the stu-

Dale wrote the song last

spring, but he has waited until
now to release it because, he
said, ‘I decided this would be the
best time ... since the court
case for the ban will be com-
ing up in January.

Transferring from Davidson
in January of 1966, Dale is now
planning to go to graduate school
after finishing at UNC.
