Brown outlines alcohol policy for 1986-87

By LAURIE BALLENGER

Next fall the legal drinking
age for beer and wine will be
raised to 21. Throughout the
1985-86 school year the Commit-
tee on Alcohol Policy, appointed
by Dean of Students Will Terry,
has worked to propose a new pol-
icy. On Wednesday committee
chairman and Union Director Wil-
liam Brown, along with commit-
tee members Lucinda Kellam,
Edwin Evans, George Guise, and
physics professor Bob Manning,
presented their proposed policy at
the union-sponsored Campus
Forum Open Luncheon.

Brown first outlined the com-
mittee’s concerns as they formu-
lated this policy: |) that education
about the use of alcohol be a focal
point, 2) the policy should recog-
nize students as adults, 3) the pol-
icy should guide those intending
to sell or serve alcohol in order to
protect both them and the college
from litigation, and 4) the policy
should be realistic so as not to
force student social life off cam-
pus.

After outlining these goals,
Brown went on to discuss the pol-
icy. The first part resembles the

current policy in that North
Carolina alcoholic beverage laws
must be complied with in respect
to 1) college-sponsored parties for
alumni, 2) parties that are spon-
sored by the college or its agents
on behalf of the college, 3) parties
given by resident advisors or hall
counselors, 4) events sponsored
by student organizations that are
affiliated with the college (i.e. the
Union), and 5) any event that is
covered by the college’s ABC
license. The policy designates
where a campus alcohol may be
served and consumed (dor-
mitories, perimeter and Patterson
Court houses, Vail Commons and
in certain areas of the Union and
Lake Campus. )

Additional restrictions which
are included in the present system
are: the prohibition of alcoholic
beverages from. athletic events;
any student activity funds col-
lected by the college may not be
used to purchase alcohol for any-
one under the legal drinking age;
kegs are prohibited from dorms.

The major change is the fol-
lowing: Patterson Court Council
must develop and maintain a pol-
icy with regard to serving al-

coholic beverages. The policy that
the PCC develops must address
the state laws, controlled service
of and access to events, service to
minors and to those obviously in-
toxicated, availability of food and
alternative beverages, functions at
which prospective members are
recruited, drinking games and
drunk driving, and responsibility
for damages.

The PCC must determine pro-
cedures for enforcement of its pol-
icy and provide for and/or partici-
pate in alcohol education pro-
grams. Three-fourths of Patterson
Court houses need to approve the
policy annually. For individual
house approval, a two-thirds vote
iS necessary.

Perimeter houses must formu-
late their own policies which can
be adopted with the approval of
two-thirds of house residents.
Both the Patterson Court Policy
and the Perimeter Houses’ poli-
cies must be submitted to the Dean
of Students office for approval no
later than Monday of the last week
of spring term.

In conjunction with the Patter-
son Court policy, the new system
will require that all parties where

attendance will exceed 30 people
must be registered with the Dean
of Students office at least three
days in advance, and that advertis-
ing the sale or service of alcoholic
beverages be prohibited.

After describing the policy,
Brown opened the forum for ques-
tions. Students questioned the
registration policy, asking what
would happen if an unplanned
gathering of 15 snowballed into a
party? The committee assured
them that while these occurrences
do happen, every effort must be
made to register a party ahead of
time. Students also asked whether
there would be a limit as to how
many parties a house could regis-
ter. The Dean’s office may try to
advise a house against having an
excessive number of parties, but it
cannot veto a registered party.
The question of enforcement is
still being discussed in the Student
Conduct Council.

The Committee on Alcohol
Policy has spent time formulating
this policy utilizing discussions
with each other, with the college
lawyers, and with drug coun-
selors. For the proposed policy to
be officially adopted, it must be

Friday, April 11, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

approved by the CCRL, Student
Conduct Council, and President
Kuykendall and then the Board of
Trustees.

The provision concerning
party registration is not, as com-
mittee members Christie Johnson
and William Brown pointed out, a
response to Dean Terry’s “Out-
basket.” Rather, promoting re-
sponsible drinking is the reason
behind the changes. Kellam said:
“The whole purpose of the policy
is to keep people from driving [off
campus] to drink. If Davidson
truly cares about its students then
it’s going to formulate a policy
that will keep students safe.”

Several students asserted that
this proposed policy was only a
confirmation of “business as
usual.” Brown and the other com-
mittee members hastened to dis-
agree, citing that not only must
registration be taken seriously but
that Patterson Court must formu-
late a workable, enforceable pol-
icy.

The committee has taken the
position that since the students are
adults, they must take responsibil-
ity for formulating a realistic pol-
icy.

Two perimeter houses to close starting next year

By KEITH FINCH

Davidson College has decided
to discontinue the use of two of its
perimeter houses as student resi-
dences.

The McConnell House, lo-
cated on the east side of North
Main Street, will house the
Alumni Office after the end of the
1985-86 school year. The house is
currently the residence of 14 stu-
dents. Harding House, also lo-
cated on Main Street and currently
the home of I1 students, will be
used as housing for faculty and
staff members next year.

nings said that the decision to
move administrative offices to the
perimeter houses was based to
some degree upon a shortage of
space in Chambers for faculty of-
fices and classrooms.

He said that the College will
eventually eliminate all student
residency in perimeter houses.
“We're also trying to phase out
perimeter houses because they're
expensive to keep up and because
they're fire hazards. The houses
are old and a lot of the electircal
wiring has, with age, tended to
have problems. Security is also a

front doors are rarely locked.”
Jennings said that the decrease
in available student housing re-
sulting from the conversion of the
perimeter houses has been pro-
vided for. “We picked up two of
the college apartments which will
house four people each. That will
almost make up for Harding
House. We wil make triples in
Duke suites and Carnegie base-
ment rooms, and we'll pick up
another 10 spaces in Cannon and
Sentelle dorms by making some of
the larger singles into smaller dou-
bles. We'll more than make up for

trade-off is that it'll be more
crowded on campus, and the more
people you put into a room the
more potential there is for
trouble.”

Jennings said that the college
is not planning to sell any perime-
ter houses, but instead plans to
eventually convert all residential
perimeter houses to other uses.

He added, “I really can’t see
us converting any more perimeter
houses until we come up with a
plan for new housing.”

Jennings said that he would

“apartment style”: “If we’re able
to build new housing in the next
few years, my preference would
be that we go to an apartment style
option, where perhaps six people
would have their own bedrooms
adjoining a kitchinette, a dining
room, and a living area. Such an
arrangement would give you the
option of having a living area that
you could share with whoever you
want. That would be a viable re-

placement for the perimeter
houses.”
He added, “In terms of actual

dollars on the table, there are cur-
rently no plans for new housing.”
