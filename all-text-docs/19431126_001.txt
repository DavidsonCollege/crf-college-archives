Surgeon Tells
of Great Need

Dr. James Woods Lived in
China During War

Dr. James Woods, the college phy-
sician, who for the first years of the
war was both a physician and a sur-
geon in the war-torn city of Chink-
iang, China, when interviewed stated
that the two most pressing medical
needs of China were more doctors
and more medicine. The later, due
to inflation, has reached almost a
prohibitive cost. The exchange has
risen from three to one, ten years
ago, to eighty to one. This means
that instead of taking three it now
takes eighty Chinese ddllars to buy
one dollars’ worth of medical sup-
plies.

the supply of quinine to the Burma

Civilian Need Great

The population of the Burma
Road area in normal times is not
great, but now due to the Chinese
army and the civilians required to
build and maintain the, road, the
population has beén multiplied many
times. The army has, comparatively
speaking, adequate medical care, but
the civilians, of whom there are
thousands have had little provision
made for them. The Red Cross has
done something in the way of set-
ting up small hospitals‘and First Aid
stations to take care of the civilian
workers.

“Funds -given in the past have
done untold amount of good,” said
Dr. Woods who can speak from ex-
perience.
