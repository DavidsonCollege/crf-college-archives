Men’s soccer dominates conference

Norbet leads ’Cats to 3-1 victory over toppled Citadel

By RICHARD CONNOLLY
Staff Writer

Last Tuesday, the Davidson men’s soccer
team rode onto the fields of The Citadel
brandishing a double-edged sword—the dual
honors of an eight-match rein over United
States military schools and an unblemished
record in Southern Conference play.

With great skill and a quiet confidence, the
Wildcats returned home with both streaks
safely intact. Stepping up once again to lead
the ’Cats was senior tri-captain Chris Norbet,
who netted two goals to boost his season total
to 12. Entering the game, Norbet’s 1.11 goals
per game placed him 10th nationally in that
category, and his 2.67 points per game ranked
him 5th in the nation.

Maintaining this “torrid pace,” as head
coach Matt Spear describes it, Norbet gave
Davidson an early one-goal advantage, find-
ing the back of the net in the 33rd minute off
a pass from fellow captain Erik Ozimek.

Fiercely defending their home field, The
Citadel responded in the 43rd minute, as
Justin Davis notched only the 3rd goal for the

Bulldogs all season.
Ozimek scored the game winner in the

72nd minute, when he fired home a pass‘from'

senior Paul Watson. Norbet secured the vic-
tory over the Bulldogs in the 90th minute,
finishing a sharp pass from freshman Dan
Ferriter to give Davidson a two-goal lead.

Freshman goalie Bart Creasman, filling in
for junior Soren Johnson, who had an aca-
demic obligation, played solidly in his first
collegiate start, recording two saves and earn-
ing the 3-1 victory.

“The Citadel game was a big win for us,
especially since we were missing three start-
ers,” Spear commented. “Other players had
to step up and get the job done. Ozimek
played a fantastic game and it was nice to earn
our second conference road win.”

The squad returned to friendly Smith Field
in Richardson Stadium late Tuesday night to
face the Mountaineers of Appalachian State.
Davidson topped App State, 2-0.

Davidson will now travel to Lexington,
Va., Saturday to face Southern Conference
foe VMI.

In a significant Saturday performance, the
Davidson women’s cross-country team
breezed past the competition in the Citadel
