Another interesting fact about
the basketball season is that if the

"Cats had tossed in 9 more points

in five of their games, they would
have won these five games and this
would have them THIRD
PLACE in the conference stand-

points would have won it. Citadel
again licked us, 26-28. Three points
would have won it. Finally against
Clemson, who won 35-34, two points
would have won it. This makes a
total of five games lost by only 9
points. That’s what kept the 'Cats
out of the
tournament.

Wrestling Captain
A consistant winner in the Wild-

cat wrestling fold is none other
than’ Howard McFadyen, » has
served three years, on the varsity
team... Howard has consistently,

during his career, supplied the stu-

dents with plenty of excitement,
but his most recent achievement
happened in the meet with V. M
I. last week. V. M. I. has not lost
a meet in the last two years, and
the ‘Cats threatened to spoil this
record. With a pin over his man,

McFadyen would have accomplish-
ed the feat, and even though he did

not pin him, he broke the game
V. M. I. heavyweight’s ribs trying
to do so. He did, however, get the

decision, but Davidson lost 14 1-2
to 13 1-2. Mae has lost only one
