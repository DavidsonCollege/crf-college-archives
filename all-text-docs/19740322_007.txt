The Third Davidson
National Print and Drawing
Show opened Sunday in the
Cunningham Fine
Building. Herb Jackson, direc-
tor of the show, feels that this
is by far the best of the three
Davidson Nationals.

This show is the largest of
its kind in the country. There
were nearly 4,000 initial en-
tries from which Juror Walter
Darby Barnard selected 169.
The entries came from all
states, and the final selection
represents the work of 139 ar-
tists from 30 states.

Jackson commented that
the overall quality of the en-
tries was very high. He
believes that Barnard’s final
choice is representative of the
‘“‘wide variety of interests
being explored in American
art today.”

Jackson indicated that the
growing influence of the
photograph is more strongly
reflected in works exhibited
this year than those exhibited

in the 1972 show.

There are perhaps more
examples of realism and
photo-realism in this show
than in previous ones.
However, there is such a wide
variety of styles, techniques,
types of art that it is hard to
maké any generalizations or
characterizations of one work
as typical of the show.

One very atypical work is an
intaglio by 1973 Davidson
graduate Ken Freed. His
“North Dakota Print Studio”
may be a personal statement
about that particular spot.

Is there a_ significant
allegorical meaning behind
the two superimposed images
in the righthand side of the
work?

This work seems to be
typical of Freed’s bold, per-
sonal treatment of spacial
relationships and surface tex-
tures. It seems to elicit

feelings of ambiguity and
ostentation in the viewer.
Four of the more nationally
known artists do not seem to
be riding into the show on the
power of

photographic

luminations or massive pen
and ink miniatures. They ap-
pear more confident in their
expressions of personal styles.

These artists are Alexander
Calder who presents ‘‘Stone
Age’’ and ‘‘Blue Moon.”’ These
two works provide a pleasant
relief from the assaults of
neoMediaeval miniatures. and
onslaughts of photo-
realismatic phantasia.

Other big names to look for
at the show are Will Barnet,
Robert Goodnough, and
Robert Natkin.

George Kitta has done two
of the more fantastic and sen-
sational prints. Both are
lithographs. One is quite ap-
proptiately arranged on a
stage where King Kong has
been transformed into a fur
coat. The other is a spec-
tacular transmutation of the
Hindenburg zeppelin disaster
of the 1930's.

Robert Nelson, who has
been represented in the David-
son show all three times, has
produced a lithograph titled
“Zeppelin Commander.” He
seems to be the perfect
mechanized commander for
today’s fully mechanized ar-
my. He comes equipped with a
pie in the sky, six shooters,
hydraulic appendages, patent
leather boots, and a sneer.

They obviously show
photographic influences but
are executed in such a way
that the artist seems to have
relied upon emotional rather
than visual laws as guiding
principles.

correlation in the show.
Amazing things have been
done in pencil. Joe Allen

achieves hypersensitive value
gradations in ‘‘Waiting
Room.”’

Shiela Bocock’s ‘‘Luncheon
of Honor ’55’’ is simple,
elegant, and very human. is

is the one on the right.

Be sure not to miss Karen
Allen’s ‘‘Chess Game” when
you see the show. It is stuck in
a corner. Her very clean,
unique style makes this pencil
drawing a little wonder.

Edward Shalala seems to
have captured the best of all
styles in his very straight-
forward messotint “Eraser.”

His black is the blackest black §

ever seen in a Davidson
National.

David Becker’s ‘In a Dark
Time”’ brings to mind visions
of a twentieth-century black
death. However, this sen-
sation does have a little dam-
per on it.

The two pencil drawings
which I admire the most are
‘‘Unrolling Series IV’’ by
Lowell C. Tolstedt, an ex-
tremely ambitious work which
must have required 12,000 No.
“2” pencils to bring to com-
pletion, and ‘‘Cat” by Helmut
Schmitt.

Schmitt demonstrates
mastery in pencil. He reveals
a great versatility in the
correct exposition of many
textures. The intended
allegory in his subject matter
may be trite, but his style and
control of pencil more than
compensate.

In summary, the show is im-
pressive, of high quality, and
the place to go on campus if
you are searching for in-
spiration, for a place to pur-
chase a great work of art, or to
get into visual mind games.

The Davidson National will
be eliciting ooh’s and aah’s un-
