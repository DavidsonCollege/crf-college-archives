The above is a diagram of how Davidson defeated N. C. State in Raleigh last Saturday. This was drawn by Reynolds, on the staff of The News and Observer,
and was gladly sent The Davidsonian for use this week. It clearly shows every detail of the game, and anyone who failed to witness the contest can obtain a

comprehensive idea as to how the ball

and original music will feature the act.

In the Senior stunt, the audicence is to be
entertained by an entirely original act, of a
type which has never been presented before
in this school. It is to consist of a-strong
man show, and a tight rope performance.
The tight rope performer has entered David-
son as a senior from another college, and it
is only of late that his ability as an acrobat
has been discovered. The best senior talent

eral numbers during the evening. Their

music will probably be used between the
acts of the presentation.

At the time of publication, the plans for
the Sophomores act had not been completed,
but they are expected to give an interesting
stunt. It will probably consist of a short
play or character sketch.

As a whole, stunt night will be well worth
anyone’s time and a large audience is ex-
pected. All students and visitors are urged
to attend.

Citadel have both fallen before the onslaught

from their end of the field will be such play-
ers as Capt. Thad Brock, Joe McCall, and
Walter Fraley. It is with a great deal of

confidence that Davidson adherents will
watch this team go on the field, despite the
odds which are against them.

Coaches Younger and Collins are unable,
as the paper goes to press, to announce the
teams which will start the game because of
various injuries. However, it is probable
that the following men will begin the game
today.

Whittle Wins First

Place in Decathlon

Heath Whittle carried off first place in the
recent Track Decathlon with a total of 212
points. Of the ten events in which he parti-
cipated, he took first place in four of them.
Second honors went to Norton who had 195
points to his credit.

The following is a list of the leading ten
men and the points which they earned. Whit-
tle, 212, Norton, 195, Lafferty, 175, Bran-
non, 156, Gorham, 147, Neal, 146, Gwinn,
140, Glasgow, 131, McCallie and Pardington
tied with 121 points each.

Whittle had the best time in three running
events and the winning distance in the broad
jump. The track trials in which he placed
first were the 100 yard dash, which he ran
in 10.9 seconds; the 300 yard dash in 34.9
seconds; and the 120 yard low hurdles in
the good time of 14 seconds. His distance in
the broad jump was 19 feet, 10 inches.

Lafferty took first place in the 880 yard
run with a time of 2.30. Brannon proved his
ability as a distance man by copping the
mile and the two mile runs. His time for the
former was 5:00, he ran the latter in 10:58.

In the field meet, Gardner won the high
jump by clearing the bar at 5 feet, 8 inches.
Pardington reached. the altitude of 9 feet to
win the pole vault event. Perrell was the top
man in the shot put. His distance was 30
feet, 2 inches. Bettis led the field in the
discus throw by sailing the discus a distance
of 91 feet. Gwinn hurled the javelin a dis-
tance of 115 feet to win this event.

Doctor Richards and Rev. J. E. Flowe
were in Taylorsville Sunday, installing Mr.
A. M. Moffett as pastor there. Mr. Moffett
is an alumnus of this college finishing in 25.

Miss Charlotte Hunter of the Winston-
Salem High School faculty spent the week-
end here.
