Challenging slate
faces tennis team

By DAVID HULL
Staff Writer

Davidson’s men’s varsity
tennis team began practice
last week and coach Jeff
Frank appears to be optimistic
about the season ahead,
despite the large number of
young and relatively inexperi-
enced players on the team.

‘‘We have a really young
team this year, but I think as
the season progresses and the
players are able to get more
experience we should finish
the year strongly,’ Frank
commented.

The team lost Chip Bondur-
ant, its top-seeded player last
year, to the Junior Year
Abroad program as well as its
third-seeded player, John
Mitchell, who graduated.

According to coach Frank,
the top four players on the
team, at the present time, are
Allard Castelein, an interna-
tional student from Holland,
juniors Mike Barnhill and
Brian Cooper, and sophomore
John Trout.

Frank is also counting
heavily on junior Stewart
Boswell and freshman Harry
Griffith, Jeff..Lyle, and Rick
Johnston. In doubles,
sophomore Andy White and
junior Brian Berry will be

relied on for experience.

The schedule this year will
be harder that past years with
the addition of Penn State,
VMI, and the University of
Virginia.

‘‘The roughest portion of
our schedule will come early in
the season. I think, in the long
run, this will help the team
becuase the best way to get
the team ready is to play as
many tough matches as
possible early in the season,”’
Frank remarked.

“T feel we will be ready by
the time the Southern
Conference Championship
comes around. We will also
have the advantage of playing
the championship here at
Davidson where our players
will have an advantage on the
clay courts.”’

The tennis team’s first
match will be away against
UNCC on Saturday, March 5,
during spring break.

A high-powered Davidson
College rifie team easily de-
feated N.C, A & T at a
February 5 home match by a
score of 1285 to 1113. The win
boosted the Wildcat shooters’
record to 10-3.

Highlights of the match
were sophomore Katherine
Whitney’s record 267 and the
five man team total of 1285, a
three year record score for the
Wildcats.

Whitney and fellow soph-
omore Tom Niblock tied with
match high 98’s in the prone
position. Whitney captured
the high kneeling score with a

frightening 93. Junior Tom x

Miller had the high standing
score at 79.

Miller and Niblock tied with
259’s. Senior Ben Simms pos-
ted a 254. Senior Rob Mitchell
rounded out the top five with a
246.

Freshmen Robbie Kirkendol
and John Parham performed
extremely well, posting scores
of 243 and 233, respectively.
Parham’s 97 in the prone and
89 kneeling were an unexpec-
ted, but crucial contribution to
the team’s overall score. Only
a poor standing: score kept
John from counting in the top
