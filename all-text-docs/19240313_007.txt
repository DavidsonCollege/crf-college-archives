VARIOUS TOWNS WILL BE
VISITED BY GLEE CLUB

The “Wildcat songsters” unfortunate-

ting another extensive tour as the one
they had during the past fall,
South Carolina and Georgia, because of
the faculty ruling, allowing only one
week each year for such a tour.

the nearby towns on any three Satur-

The present plans are that concerts will
be given in Lenoir, Statesville, and Char-
lotte some time in the near future.
Many requests have come to the Glee
Club to present their program again here
in Davidson. Due to the sudden illness
of Wallace Purdy, the club’s pianist, the
concert that was scheduled just before
| examinations, was postponed. The plan
jat present is that the club will again
lappear before the student body, friends

Easter holidays. The program will be
changed in a few respects and it
|hoped that the singers and musicians
| will again hold the interest and furnish
| pleasure for especially their fellow stu-
dents, and every one else.

with more care and consideration,

The attention of the three other classes
has been brought to these resolutions,
