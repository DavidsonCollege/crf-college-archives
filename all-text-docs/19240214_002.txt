men, %
Clear was your vision as the eagle’s eye;
All mothers blessed your noble courage
when
You shrank from war, lest their loved
ones should die:
Ill.
| And many a happy home is bright today

Because you waited, patient, calm and
true; ;

; Because you fain would find some other
way,

, Although a braver battle never knew.

! IV.

By your sheer strength of soul you held
it back,

The grim red tide that beat upon our
shore;

You turned the cannon from its blood-
drenched track,
sheathed the sword,
fruit it bore.

V.
And when at last no longer human will
Could stand against the tempest’s raging

You ere yet red

might,
You went to France to strive and labor
still
To lead the nations in the way of light.
VI.
Then, after victory, back you came to
plead,
Across the continent, aged beyond your
years;
Giving your life to curb the demon’s
greed;
To banish grief; to dry the mothers’
tears,
; VII.
Greater than party: a patriot, noble,
pure,
The world salutes you as you lie so

still;
Long as time your memory shall endure
Your noble-deeds the heart of history
thrill,
VIII.
Four years, four ‘months, you faced a
deadly foe,
Fighting in silenge, calm, without com-
plaint;
Calmly you watched life’s shuttle come
and go :
Until the loom of life grew slow and
faint.
IX.
Fair was the pattern; hues of faith and
love,
The fainting shuttle wove with match-
less grace;
And in the pattern sat a gentle dove—
To match the sternness of a Caesar’s
face.
X.
But how you suffered no man ever knew,
While she, your helpmeet tender, watch-
ed beside;
Tempering every wintry wind that blew
From out the silent ocean, white and
wide.
XI.
To her the nation lifts its fervent praise,

Nor Gracchi’s mother bore a nobler
name;
She, whose warm smile was like the sun’s
soft rays,
When evening and the hastening twilight
came.
XII.

Some day the world shall see your dream
come true;

When war no more shall rule the sons
of men; ;

When faith and love shall spread like
healing dew

Where all the battles of the past have

been.
XIII.
Some day the flags of hate shall all be
furled, :

And all the seas shall sing of new de-
sires;

In stainless strength like some sublime
Jungfrau;

Brave was your life, a battle of the
strong,
And all the world salutes your spirit now.
XVI.
“Dead on the field of honor’—nodw at
last :
Brave as the legions that lie still in

France;
E’en death saluted as your spirit passed
And lift high his cold and shining lance,

L’envoi: *¢
Rest you great soul;
O rest you calm and deep.
Sweet be your sleep
As silent ages roll.
Roll, muffled drums;
He comes, he comes;
The shadowy lines salute;
O’er fields of France the wind sings like
a flute;

And all the bells of all the seas in toll}:

Ring out the passing of his mighty soul.
Wadesboro, February 4, 1924.

RURAL SUNDAY SCHOOLS
INCREASE ATTENDANCE

The Sunday School work, as carried on
by the students last week, was as fol-
lows:

At Shearer the attendance was good
with 49 present. The regular night serv-
ice and Christian Endeavor classes were
not held, but gave place to an interest-
ing Foreign Mission program, The topic
of the evening was Brazil and a good pro-
gram was given on that subject. The
meeting was held by A. C. Ray, L. B.
Gibbs, P. M. Dulin and Guy Morrow.

At Brawley’s a regular meeting was
held by W. A. Christian and McJunkin,
with an average attendance. There were
20 members present.

At the Mill Chapel, the regular week-
ly meeting was held by Marion Murray.

At the convict camp, A. M. Martin and
A. N. Moffett held the Sunday School.

At Oak Grove the meeting was held
by T. E. Hagar.

At Cornelius, a promising meeting was
held. The attendance reached 79, which
is the largest since the Christmas holi-
days. The meeting was led by Wade
Allison and Tom Barr, both of whom
taught classes. A new way of increas-
ing their membership is being tried in a
contest for new members. The contest
has arranged between Allison’s
class and a class of young ladies, and
shows signs of being very successful.
Barr led the singing, while Allison play-
ed the piano.

The attendance was large at all the
meetings this week. It is hoped that
spring will see even greater success in
the growth of these classes.

FRESH SCHEDULE

Up to the present time the Freshman
basketball team has played three games,
winning from Greensboro High, Moores-
ville High and Trinity Fresh.

The team leaves on its initial trip Wed-
nesday, February 13th, to be away un-
til Monday, February 18th.

The schedule is as follows:

Wednesday, 13—Oak Ridge Institute
at Oak Ridge.

Thursday, 14—Trinity Fresh, at Dur-
ham.

Friday, 15—Carolina Fresh, at Chapel
Hill.

Saturday, 16—State Fresh, at Raleigh.

The team will return sometime Mon-
day. ‘The season will be concluded by
playing a return game with Mooresville
High at Mooresville, the date for which
has not been fixed.

its captain but also in the number of points
scored by any individual player. . This team

Grey and J. C. McMaster won their laurels
in the guard positions. King led his team,
which was very light, through a hard sched-
ule of games with the record of the loss of
only one state game and the winning of six
of the ten games played. He was picked to
hold the end position on both the All-South-
ern and the All-American elevents.

King was even of more value to-,David-
son’s basketball team, on which he played
three years, becoming its captain his Senior
year. With him at right forward and Dutch
Hengeveld at center, the Wildcat basketball
team of ’17 had a season which has hardly
been equalled by any other Davidson team.
King scored the greatest number of points
of any individual on the team and his ag-
gressive attack materially aided his team in
winning decisively seven out of the eleven
games played.

Besides his athletic activities, King was
secretary-treasurer of the ‘“D” Club, and a
member of the Athletic Association, the
Eumenean Literary Society and the Kappa
Alpha fraternity.

After receiving a Bachelor of Science de-
gree with the Class of °18, King joined the
Navy. It was during a Navy football game,
in which he did stellar work at an end posi-
tion, that Walter Camp acclaimed him the
greatest end he had ever seen in action. Da-
vidson can well be proud of her son who
received such a high compliment from one
of the greatest athletic critics.

SONG HITS WILL AGIN BE PUB-
LISHED BY MR. McCAIN

Peanut Parcher Will Be Illuminated
by Popular Song Titles

In all of the annals of musical history
there have none been so popular and
notorious as one of our present seniors,
Watt MacCain, whose weekly hits have
gained for him a name thoroughout the
entire South and, more than- likely, the
whole of the American Democracy. In-
deed his fame has increased to such an
extent that even the Editor of the David-
sonian has seen fit to humbly-implore of
the composer that he might publish just
the titles of his latest song hits. (Of
course, it would be impractical for'!him
to ask for a complete publication).

He must have some thrills to expose
such striking melodies:as “The Midnight
Rose” and “Midnight sat on a tack,” but
these are things that ordinary minds can-
not begin to comprehend, for classical
}emotions are above student heads.
| Euterpe has showered her blessings and
|talents upon this musician, and it was
destined that he receive his great pub-
| licity and world-wide fame through the
| Peanut Parcher.

Time has shown a great and favorable
|inerease in this direction, and prospects
{seem truly wonderful and widespread
|for the noble Watt. By request, the
| titles of weekly song hits will again ap-
pear in the Davidsonian. The absence
of this feature detracts materially from
the popularity of the college weekly, in
the concensus of opinion.

The difference is ‘in
the cut. There’s an air
about this overcoat that
you will find nowhere
else; it’s smartly cut;
every detail—the roll of
the lapel, the spacing of
the buttons, the placing
of the pockets-isexactly
right.

you like, we have it.
