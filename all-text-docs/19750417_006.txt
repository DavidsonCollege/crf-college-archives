‘Norwegian label covers unsung talent

By ERNEST GLENN
Staff Writer

Albums Reviewed:
Conference of the Birds-
David Holland Quartet
Illusion Suite- Stanley Cowell
Trio

Witchi-Tai-To- Jan Garbarek-
Bobo Stenson Quartet

The three records reviewed
‘here are excellent examples ,
of the unsung greatness of
Many jazz musicians.

None of these are big
names, and the record label is-
no Amercian monolith: of
- power, ‘but ‘the’ ‘Norwegian
. label ECM, which is.a pioneer
in progressive jazz recording.

The names on these records
may become more famous if
their talents are the deter-
minants rather than hard sell
promotion.

David Holland is probably
the best known of the
musicians here. Now playing
bass for his own quartet, their
“Conference of the Birds’
album offers the widest
variety of jazz in one record
seen in a long time.

Chick Corea

Holland and the other mem-
bers of his quarter have
played with numerous big
names, including Chick Corea
on the ‘‘Circle’’ album
reviewed a few weeks ago.
Their polish and_ technical
abilities shine through -the
whole album.

team Anthony Braxton with
Sam Rivers on flute duets.
Both the title song and ‘‘Now
Here/Nowhere’”’ feature these
two musicians is soft lyrical
numbers. Holland’s bass sets
up a unique progression -on
tones while also providing the
major rhythmic lines of the
pieces.
Bopping sax numbers

The other songs on the
record run the gamut from
bopping sax numbers in the
style of Ornette Coleman or
late Coltrane, like ‘‘See Saw”
to pure cacophony in “Q&A,”
though their chaos is more
pleasant than some.

All songs on the album are
Holland’s compositions. He
beautifully blends the in-
dividual sounds of each in-
strument, allowing for solos
without getting boring. His
base never intrudes into the
compositions but can always
be felt.

The second album features
primarily the solo talents of
Stanley Cowell. The name of
his trio’s record is ‘‘Illusion
Suite.’’ Cowell is a fine pianist

Cowell effectively blends

the sound of the piano into .
‘rhythms set up by bass and -

drums on numbers like
‘‘Maimoun”’ and ‘Ibn
Mukhtarr Mustapha.’’ Each
performer solos on several oc-
casions as well.

As my particular bias
against electricity in certain
types of jazz has been stated
before, I. must mention’ that
Cowell’s electric numbers do
not achieve the quality of
those pieces played on the
piano. At times the electricity
becomes somewhat too funky
and distorted in the context of
the rest of the record.

Tai-To” is performed by the
Scandinavian group known as
the Jan Garbarek-Bobo Sten-
son Quartet.

But Bobo must be a trans-
planted expatriate from
Harlem, because the group
possesses a thrilling blend of
mainline Black American
jazz with the polish and tight-
ness of a European group.

The sax of Garbarek can
wail with the best in the
coterie which is carrying on
the prominence of this in-
strument in jazz. He ranges
from long sustained series of
notes that are surprisingly
tense and lively to jerky solos
jumping up and down the
scales.

This is one of ‘those rare
albums where every cut is
worth listening to, “A.I.R.”

and “‘Kukka’”’ feature tle ex-
changes between Garbarek
and Stenson on the piano.

On the piano Stenson can
fill in the gaps with good back
up or launch into his own lead
on solo. Three of this group
also have another album out,
substituting Keith Jarrett on
the piano for Stenson. The dif-
ference in the two records
says much about the talents
of each of the pianists.

In spite of the trend towards
electrified pop that much jazz
is diluting itself with, these
three records restore faith in

ibilities of where a
jazz combo can go,

; without giving in to the mass

market. The talent in these
musicians causes one to won-
