NUMBER TWENTY-ONE

Student Council To Conduct Referendum On Fraternity Reports

By FRANK FLEMING
Davidsonien Staff Writer

Students will express their.
opinions Thursday on the
fraternity question in a ref-
erendum unanimously ap-
proved by the Student
Council Monday night.

Each ballot will contain 13
questions. Each of the nine im-
mediate proposals of the Frater-
nity Evaluation Committee re-
port will be put to a yes-no vote,
Then the committee report as
well as the two minority state-
ments will be put to an approve-
disapprove vote. Students will
be asked to indicate whether or
not they are members of a fra-
ternity.

Following Charlie Marshall's
motion that ‘‘the report be sub-
mitted to the Student Body for
an opinion poll on the three dif-
ferent sections of the report.”
Fred Sackett amended it to
read: ‘In the student referen-
dum each of the nine ‘Immedi-
ate Recommendations’ will be
presented for a year-or-no an-
swer.

“There will also be a section
which each student may ex-
press his general favor or dis-
favor on the majority report,
the minority report of Dr John
Kelton, Art Ross, Bill Council,
and Chaplain Will Terry, and
the minority report of Ed Hasel-
den.”

STUDENTS’ OPINION ’

Sackett explained, ‘‘Such a de-
tailed referendum will give a re-
flection on the student stand on
the most important issues. I
think that the faculty will prob-
ably vote on each recommenda-
tion separately; Thus, a break-
down on campus opinion could
be more easily interpreted than
a general referendum.”

After the council had passed
Sackett's amendment by a vote
of 14-0, David Powell introduc-
ed another amendment: ‘Let
each student also record wheth-
er he is an Independent or fra-
ternity man.”

In wanting to clarify the ref-
erendum even further, Powcll
said, ‘‘An indication of a stu-
dent’s affiliation would show pre-
cisely where strong fraternity
sentiment lies. People naturally
would expect fraternities to op-
pose this report, but what about

ag

w

Independents?"

With Bill Council being the
only absentee, the council pass-
ed Powell's amendment 12-2. It
then unanimouly ‘approved Mar-
shall's amended motion and
turned to the problem of setting
a date.

WALKER MOVES

David Walker moved to hold
the vote on Monday, Supporting
this date, John Barrow pointed
out, ‘Since Monday is a regular
election day anyway, students
would have all day to complete
the opinion poll.”

On the other hand, Sackett
mentioned, ‘Since there will be
two discussion forums on Tues-
day and Wednesday, we should
delay the referendum until
Thursday so as to give the Stu-
dent Body more time to con-
sider their opinions.”

After Walker's motion was de-
feated 6-7, Powell moved to ac-
cept the suggested Thursday
date instead. By 9-3 the council
adopted this fater time.

Beginning discussion on the re-
port itself, President Will Jack-
son mentioned that some of its
recommendatiuns would ‘‘re-
quire the financial responsibil-
ity of the college.’ Since the
college will be operating on a
“very tight budget next year,"
this factor may influence future
action.

ATTACKS SCOPE

Gresham called the report
‘‘much more than we asked for’’
and opposed the report's state-
ment that the fraternity system
is ‘contrary to any Christian or
democratic social ethic.”

“What are we going to do with
it," asked Arnie Snider. Jack-
son answered, “Although next
year's council will decide on
some issues, it is up to us to
respond soon—either in approval
or disapproval.” ="

The most definite stand tak-
en at the Monday meeting was
Walker's motion ‘‘to endorse the
Haselden report.” However,
Sackett’s counter motion to ta-
ble Walker's proposal was up-
held by 8-6. Such an endorse-
ment, however, could be recon-
sidered next Monday

Walker commented, “The
council is giving up its leader-
ship in this action.”

Opposing Walker's proposal,
Frist said, ‘First let's see the

Evaluation Is Studied
By Faculty Committee

Davidsonian Staff Writer

The Faculty Committee on Fraternities, chaired by
Dr. William G. MeGavock, began consideration of the
Fraternity Evaluation Committee’s report on the two mi-

nority reports this week.

McGavock stated that the
committee was following a fac-
ulty directive ‘that the faculty
Committee on Fraternities be
requested to review the report
of the Fraternity Evaluation
Committee and make recom-
mendations at the April meet-
ing of the faculty on any spe-
cific proposals contained in the
report which are subject to fac-
ulty action.”

The committee held meetings
on Monday and Wednesday of
this week. McGavovk indicated
that the committee would make

to the regular committee mem-
bers, there are three advisory
positions held by Dean of Stu-
dents Richard Burts, Assistant
Dean Robert Jones, and Presi
dent of the Interfraternity Coun.
cil Fred Sackett.

Rick von Unwerth, who re-
signed as president of the IFC
this week, petitioned the com-
mittee to allow him an unoffi-
cial seat in an advisory capac.
ity Wednesday but was denied
that seat on the basis that the
committee had previously been
limited to éts present member-
ship.

a thorough background study of
the fraternity situation at De-
vidson College, interview mem-
bers of the Fraternity Evalua-
tion Committee, formulate their
own evaluation, and, finally,
present these pecommendations
to the faculty.

If such recommendations are
made and passed by the faculty,
the trustees will have the op-
portunity to review or pass the
faculty proposals at their spring
meeting on April 30. °

Serving on the committee un-
der McGavock are Professors
Chalmers Davidson. Sam Ma-
loney, T. F. Clark, Bruce Jack-

son, George Labban (who is fill- _

ing the position vacated by Dr.

W. G. Workman), Chaplain Will

Terry, and C. Shaw Smith, di-
rector of the Un‘on. In addition

students’ opinion: then we'll
act.”

Finally Sackett suggested,
“The council would express its
own feelings in next Tuesday's

assembly — before the Student
Body votes.’ No decision was

made for any definite action.

OTHER ACTION
In other business, Jackson pro-

posed an amendment to change
Section 2, paragraph ‘‘j’’ of the

Student Council By-Laws to read
as follows: ‘‘In the election for

president of the Student Body,
speeches shall be made in As-
sembly by those candidates who

have filed for the position.

“Should there be more than
five candidates. a runoff shall
be held to limit the number of

———

epeeches to five.”

Sackett, chairman of the elec-
tions committee, supported this
change by pointing out, ‘Five °
speeches each six minutes long

would fill a chapel period.”

Despite Walker's argument

that an increased number of
speeches would be “inversely
proportionate” to student inter-
est, the council passed the

amendment 13-2.

The last business was Tom
Irons’ report on the mercury va-

por lamp controversy. Irons
said, “President Martin has can-
celled the order for the. lights.
General student opinion favors
extension of the present system.
Apparently Dr. Martin is will-
ing to go along with whatever
the students want to do.”

Council Takes Presidency
13 Votes

From Meschan By

Gresham, Matthews ©

Take VP Positions

Bill Council defeated David Meschan by a 13-vote
margin (327-314) in Wednesday’s election to capture the

Student Body presidency.

Council, a member of Phi
Delta Theta, is an English
major and is presently sec-
ond vice-president of the
student body. From Wash-
ington, D. C., he was a mem-
ber of the Fraternity Evalu-
ation Committee, and serves
on the Student-Faculty Con-
ference Committee and the
tennis team. He is a former
Dana Scholar.

Council's election platform
centered around the following
proposals:

1. The increased availability
and expansion of present recre-
ational facilities to serve and

meet the needs of the student —

body.

Il. The establishment of a
system of course evaluation ‘by
students to aid fuculty mem
bers in assessing their success
in the classroom.

Ill. A continued evatuation of
Davidson’s social system, em.
phasizing that social inequities
are existent and favoring the
adoption of the minority report
of Ross, Kelton, Terry, and
Council as a first step in the
dissolving of these inequities.

Meschan's campaign bid ad-
vocated:

I. The preservation of the’

present and strong fraternity
system, with the strengthening
of collateral facilities to allevi-
ate social inequities.

II. The replacement of requir-
ed chapel and Vespers attend-
ance by required attendance at
a widened selection of activi-
ties, including selected concerts
and lectures in various fields of
student interest.

III. The establishment of a so-
cial council. serving and sup-
ported by the entire student
body. to replace the social re-
sponsibilities of the IFC.

taling 64 per cent of the student

Council Requests
Student Reflection

By BILL COUNCIL
President-elect of the Student Body

The Student Council will conduct a poll after
chapel next Thursday to determine student reaction
to the Fraternity Evaluation Committee reports.

The poll will be in two parts.

The first will provide the opportunity to react
to each of the nine immediate recommendations of

the committee report.

The second part will permit comment on the
complete format of each of the three reports from
the committee members. To ensure reasonable famil-
iarity with the points under consideration, review
of the three reports before Thursday will be helpful.
The proposals in question deserve thoughtful con-
sideration by every student.
