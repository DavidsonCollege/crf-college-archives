dicted. “When you look at
the over-all size. ability, and
toughness of thé two squads
we're. definitely the better
team. I feel sure that we'll
win.”

If so, it will be the first
time in several years that
a Davidson athletic team has
beaten a team in any sport
from State.

According to Mobley. the
lack of experience and know.
ledge of the rules severely
hampered Davidson in the
first two losses. ‘Our backs
ran the ball too much, they
just wouldn't pass off, and
therefore we couldn't mount
any threat on offense."

Mobley also said that cer-

tain rugby _ technicalities
seemed to thwart Davidson's
attempts to score. “One

thing I'm certain of. though,
is that after this week-end
we'll have gotten on the
scoreboard.”

The stand-outs in the two
losses were few and far be-
tween but nevertheless sever-
al players did distinguish
themselves in their very
first organized rugby game.

Mobley, as usual. was one
of the mainstays of the for-
ward line, making numerous
score-saving tackles and ball
recoveries. Other linemen
stars were Eddie Rice, Sam
Davis, Teddy RaVenel, Stuart
Shelton. and Garrel Nichol-
son. ‘

Although the backfield fail-
ed to score in either game,
certain individuals, accord-
ing to Mobley. did play good
defensive games.

“Dave Branch particular.
ly stood out in the State
game, while Ed Deitrich, Jim
Marrow. Reynolds Johnson,
Bil!y Mohr. and Steve Drap-
er played good all-around
ball.” Mobley said. “Of
course Mike Lunn was tre-
mendous in the State game."

Luan. a Richardson scho-
lar from England, is the
team's ‘‘coach’’ and only
bona fide star.

“The rest of the season
may: be tougher than what
we've played so far."’ Mob-
lev concluded. ‘bt we'll be
‘mprayving the whole time.

Weidner is the shortstop. and
Stu Brown is stationed at the
“hot corner.” Pat Reid, who
played third base last year,
has been moved to second.
Bob Meadows and Wade
Shepherd. another hurler.
play first base.

Jack Latimer, now sched-
uled for utility duty, may
eventually break into the
startng line-up. while junior
Bill Shutt has fine speed and
is the top pinch-runner, be-
sides helping out in the out-
field.

Freshman Harold Wilkerson
is the starting catcher. °‘He
has the potential to be the
best catcher we've had
here,” stated Stevens.
Mapes and Brown can back
him up behind the plate.
Last year Wilkerson was the
second-round draft choice of
the New York Mets.

Emphasis is on youth in the
pitching staff. This year's
squad has only five hurlers,
and three are freshman.
Rick Pipan, Marshall Case,
and Frye are the rookie mem-
bers of the mound corps and
all were high school sensa-
tions. Shepherd, a sophomore.
and junior Johnny Riggs
round out the staff.

Stevens commented briefly
on the opening season loss
to Pfeiffer, 10-5. “The boys
were tight and a little too
keyed up for the game. We
made a few errors in the
first inning and they had
seven runs before we knew
it.

“We settled down after
the first frame and looked
real good,’ continued Ste-
vens. ‘‘Marshall Case look-
ed especially impressive on
the mound.” Case pitched
shutout ball in relief of Pi-
pan.

“All the Southern Confer-
ence teams are going to be
better this year. including
us,” said Stevens. ‘‘The con-
ference is divided into a
Southern division and a
Northern division. In the
Southern division with David-
son are East Carolina, Fur-
man. and The Citidel. The

two division winners meet at
the end of the season in a
best of three series for the
Southern Conference crown.’

Stevens would not pick a
favorite for either the South-
ern division or the Southern
Conference. ‘‘With all the
teams getting stronger, any
one will have a shot at the
erown, including Davidson.”

There are a total of 37

NETTER RETURNS BACKHAND
Davidson rips Calvin College by 9-0

University in a match played
at Davidson, and were down-
ed 6-3. However, the follow-

ing day they traveled to
Wofford and romped 9-0 over:

a much weaker team.

The following day. though.
a surprising Furman team:
whipped the Wildcats 7-2,
handing Coach Fogleman his
first loss in the conference
since George Washington
nipped his squad in 1965.

The netmen returned
home Monday for a meeting
with Cincinnati and were
barely edged, 5-4. Then they
ripped Calvin College 9-0
Tuesday — and faced Am.
herst on Wednesday.

However, both Fogleman
and team captain Woody
Faulk expressed optimism
about the remander of the
‘season despite the record
thus far.

“This team is going to have
an uphill battle because we're
so inexperienced.” Faulk
explained. The netters have
won four consecutive South-
ern Conference Champion
ships but this year are hav-
ing to rely heavily on fresh.
men and sophomores.

Faulk pointed out that im-
provement is expected as
the season progresses. “I
don‘t-know how we'll be at
the end of the year,” he said.
“Much depends on how far
some of our players *come
uround.”” But he was opti-
mistic that the improvement
would come.

The loss of four seniors.
including conference champ-
ion George Berner, a Rich-

ardson Scholar of last year.
has hurt chances of the team
bringing back another title.
Also, sophomore Jim Can-
trell, a regular from last
year, has been out with mon-
onucleosis and began prac-
tice only this week.

Another blow ‘came when
Nanno Kranenborg. a Rich.
ardson Scholar from Hol-
land, decided to leave school
during the Christmas break.
He had been counted on by
Fogleman as a top perform-
er. Kranenborg is a leading
Dutch netter. :

Making the best perform.
ances thus far this year have
been senior Faulk and soph-
omore Harlan Day. Both have
won four matches while los-
ing only one. As Davidson's
top seeded player. Faulk's .
single defeat came at the
hands of Furman's Howard
Hunt, 6-2, 1-6, 6-2. Hunt was
second in last year's confer-
ence tournament to Berner.

Four subsdized teams ap-
pear to be the class in the
Southern this year. The Cit-
adel is favored to take the
title as they have everyone
back from last season’s team
that tied for second place.
Also. the conference tourna-
ment will be in Charleston
May 8-10.

George Washington was
the other team that tied for
second and it also has every-
one back from that successful
squad. Furman and William
and Mary are two teams
that have shown great im-
provement and should be
ranked ahead of Davidson.

Records Fall To ‘Cat Cindermen,
Whittle Is Optimistic About Season

By MARK HODGES
Sports Writer

Ray Sweetenburg leaped
past the Davidson school re-
cord in the triple jump and
the Davidson 440 relay team
broke its old school mark in
the News Ptedmont Relays
in Greenville, S. C. last Sat-
urday.

Rick Lyon also placed third
in the 100 yard dash with a
tie in 9.7 seconds.

Competing in a field de-
scibed by Heath Whittle,
coach of the Davidson track
team, as ‘very stiff com-
petition,” Sweetenburg took
fourth place with his record
leap of 44-9. The old mark
was 4 feet 5% inches.

Though not winning a
placing. the 440 relay team.
consisting of Tommy Rich-
ardson, Whit Morrow, Carl
Salter, and Rick Lyon, came
in with a clocking of 42.5,
breaking the old record by
three-tenths of a second.

“Davidson's track team
opens its regular season at
home tomorrow afternoon in
a trimeet with Appalachian
State College and the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at
Charlotte. This year's sched-
ule includes ten regular sea-

son contests, the Davidson

Relays, the North Carolina

State Meet, and the South-
ern Conference Tournament.

Commenting on the pro-
spects for a successful track
season, Coach Whittle re-
marked: ‘At this point, I'm
in hopes that we can win
more than we lose.’

He went on to explain that
“we have real good indivi-
uals but the team needs more
balance. We need middle and
long distance runners, and
we don't have any vaulters
at all.”

These ‘‘good individuals”
mentioned by Coach Whittle
are Rick Lyon, Whit Morrow,
and Tommy Richardson on
sprints; Karl Sweetenburg
and George Rogester. high
hurdles: Lyon and Ken Hill,
440 yard dash; James Puc-
kett, 880 yard run: Stagg
Newman on the mile and
three mile run: Tom Rogers

and Sweetenburg. _ triple
jump: Tony Orsbon and
Sweetenburg. high ‘ump:

Kerry Keith javelin; Steve
Kirley and Tom Baker, shot-
pt: and Rogester and Sweet-
enbnrg on the long jump and
440 hurdles.

Coach Whittle also cited
Greg Cox, an all round per-
former in the sprints, hurd-
les, und jumps. He said that
Cox has suffered a sprained

ankle and will not compete
until the second meet of the
season against Trinity Col-
lege.

In analyzing this year's
track schedule, Coach Whit-
tle said: “The competition

is much stronger this year.
Nearly all of our cpponents
have

subsidized athletic

_

RICK LYON AND TOMMY RICHARDSON

programs.”

This, then. will be David-
son's problem: To compete
against these schools and
win with an unsubsidized
track team. Whittle pointed
to The Citadel and Furman
as having perhaps the tough-
est teams Davidson will face
in the regular season.

r yy

When asked about the
Wildcats’ chances in the
Southern Conference tourna-
ment, Whittle replied “We
have no chance of winning.
Wiliam and Mary will pro-
bably ‘take the title. But we
do have a chance to win
some of the individual
championships."'
