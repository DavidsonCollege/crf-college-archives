TOP TWENTY? |

OVERHEARD THIS WEEK was the fact that many
students are planning a big Exodus to the two ecpening
basketball games this season. The opener is in Winston-
Salem on December 2 against Wake Forest, defending
Atlantic Coast Conference champions. Then on December
5, the ‘Cats play in the Duke University Field House.

Needless to say, these two games are rugged starters.
It’s kind of like having two 50-megaton bombs fall in
your little shelter within three days.

Duke and Wake are rated 1-2 respectively in the
South in the pre-season polls, and both are assured of
national ranking when the season gets rolling.

What would happen if Davidson upset both of them?
We'd be in the Top Twenty, my friends, that’s what.

TIDBITS FROM HERE AND THERE

DAVIDSON’S next soccer foe, Pfeiffer, gives out
soccer scholarships, since they have no football team.
Small wonder they’re undefeated this season.

THE FRESHMAN SOCCER TEAM'S match with
Guilford here Wednesday resembled a PE match. The
frosh had practiced together all of one day, and Guilford
had been assembled a whole week. Most of our boys had
on PE shirts, pants and tennis shoes.

CAPTAINS for tomorrow’s football game are Joe
Ansley and Bill Dole, Jr.

CITADEL’S place kicking specialist, Bill Gilgo, is
making a determined assault on Bruce Usher's Southern
Conference record for the most field goals in one season.
Usher set the record as a freshman in 1958 with four
3-pointers. But Gilgo has a talented toe. The senior end
from Washington, C., has booted three this season—
a 43-yarder against Richmond, a 27-yard one that beat
William & Mary with two seconds remaining in the game,
and a 21-yard one that nipped Furman. His 43-yarder
broke West Virginia’s Johnny Thackston’s 39-yard record
for the longest field goal. Gilgo has another record too.
His 20 point-after-touchdown placements last season are

tops in that category.
THE CRYSTAL BALL

HOPING TO REACH 30 rights this week, our crystal
ball (25-17) foresees the following events:

i avels to William & Mary tomorrow to play
a eon tate had more than its share of trouble. But
so has Davidson. However, a good week of practice and
a sheer determination not to finish in the conference
cellar should pull the ’Cats through. Pick Davidson, 14-8.

he Citadel can sew up the conference championship
eames against sophomorish VMI. Of course, VMI is

fending champion and would like to repeat. This one
an ‘be a real thriller. In the battle ot ts military-
minded, pick experienced Citadel, say by a Gilgo field

goal, 10-7.
Other games: Memphis S

Virginia 20, George Washington 13; and Richmond 14,
VPI 7.
