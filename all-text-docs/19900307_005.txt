actually fortunate that the film was

to enjoy it for what is, a damn good
story.

The film makers have done a remark-
able job of telling this story as well.
Casting is superb, the greatest coup
being Sean Connery whois perhaps the
only actor alive today capable of play-

ing Ramius believably. Alec Baldwin
surprises everyone in his first appear-
anceasa dramatic hero. He projects just
the right mixture of competence and
modesty, changing in an instant to
steely confidence when the situation
demands. Wecansurely look foward to
seeing him again when the next of
Clancy’s books is adapted to the screen
(my bet is on Clear and Present Danger.)
Scott Glenn is ideal as Bert Mancusso,
an experienced American sub driver
and captain of the U.S.S. Dallas. He
barks out orders and technical terms
with ease, having spent a number of
days aboard asubmarine before filming
began. For the minor roles, the fim
makers actually found it more convinc-
ing to use real navy crewmen.

extreme realism unfortunately serves to
highlight the moments when the pro-
ducers were forced to use less convinc-
ing trickery such as a model plane sus-
pended in front of a blue screen or com-
puter animated torpedoes... These ef-
fects are not necessarily bad, just when
seen in relation to the rest of the film,
and cause only a momentary distrac-
tion.

Director John McTiernan keeps eve-

Nothing is over-explained or under-

Hoping for another reoniiteent
boom, like the one that followed Top
Gun, the U.S. Navy co-operated exten-
sively in the making of Red October. The
producers had several ships and planes
at their disposal and were the first to be
allowed to film aboard a serving nu-
clear submarine. The Soviet navy was
not quite so helpful.

To represent the Red October, the fil-
makers constructed a full scale sea-
going mock-up of the surfaced portion
of a Russian Typhoon class ballistic
missile submarine. For interior scenes
there were minutely detailed sets
mounted on hydraulics to mimic the

movements of ol climbing, and ~

turning.

The special effects are dazzling, in-
cluding one of the largest and most im-
pressive explosions yet put on screen.
Massive submarines glide through the
dark, murky depths of the North Atlan-
tic Ocean (rather than looking like toys
in a backyard swimming pool) while
stalking each other in deadly game of

say is that “itsnot exactly like the book.”
Film makers are always confronted
with this problem when adapting a
novel for the screen, there is more in the
book than can possibly be conveyed
during the movie's relatively short
running time.

Yet, Larry Ferguson and Donald Ste-
wart have done a masterful job writing
the screenplay for Red October (They
should receive a nod when Oscar time
rolls around again, but knowing the
Academy’s short term memory proba-
bly won’t.) Time and scope have been
condensed, which actually helps to
heighten the intensity, and even with
the cuts, the flavor of Clancy’s novel has
been preserved (we wish the CIA were
really that efficient.)

In the final analysis, The Hunt for Red
October is a first rate action: thriller.
While some may still question its social
relevance, this will be the furthest thing
from your mind as you sit slack-jawed
and white-knuckled in your local thea-
ter.

BEER, from page 4

Four of the five French beers

area, an area.of, shall we say,
“heavy German influence.”
Aside from that one secluded
locale, however, the French

good, solid export beer, with
the one exception of Brasseurs
de Paris. Children of the malt

find that extremely disturbing.
If the Japanese learned to play
baseball after only one Ameri-
can occupation, why can the -
French not brew a good, com-
petitive beer after three Ger-
man occupationsin the last 120
years? In modern European
history, German armies have

‘been marching in and out of

France with stunning regular-
ity, beginning with the Franco-
Prussian War of 1870-71.
Frenchman have had ample
opportunity to pick up the art
of beer-making, which is so
simple that the ancient Egyp-
tians (apologies to Peter Krentz

and Stone Bynum) could do it
thousands of years ago. Sure,
the French can make the hell

out of some wine, but for our
“money, we'll take beer-every
time.

In. fairness to the French,
however, it should be noted
that beer did not begin to be-
come a popular French drink
until after Europe’s 1848 revo-

lutions. To that point, beer was -

considered a peasant drink,
while the higher (snotty?)
classes stuck to their wine. The
changes of 1848 brought with
them interest in the common

man and, by extension, the
common man’sinterestin beer.
In addition, foreigners in
France, English and (surprise!)
Germans among them, also
brought an affinity for beer to
France. French breweries are
known as “brasseries,” named
for the copper brewing vats in
which the beer is produced.
