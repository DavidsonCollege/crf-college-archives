Means nominates Butner ’75
for Board of Trustees post

By MARK DEATON
Editor

Former SGA President Blair
Butner has been nominated for
a position on the Davidson Col-
lege Board of Trustees.

Melvin Means ’40 of Concord
nominated Butner from the
floor of the Alumni business
meeting to fill a.position elected
by the Alumni Association.

The Alumni Association
elects 2 members to the board
each year for four year terms.
Other candidates, ‘all
nominated by the Alumni
Nominating Committee, are
John. T. Ferguson, “J. Mc-
Chesney Jeffries. Larry J.
Dagenhart. and FE. Craig Wall.

Ballots listing the 5 can-
didates will be mailed this sum-
mer to all .members. of the
Alumni Association. The Alum-
ni Association consists of all a-
lumni of the college and will in-
clude all members of the class
of 1975.

Butner has expressed. con-
cern that there are no recent
students omthe board.

“T think: the board would
benefit from having a very
young alumnus who has seen
the campus at first hand as a
student,’”’ said Butner.

‘Considering . the _ fun-
damental changes in
academics. social life.

athletics. and other areas right
down the line. a verv recent a-
lumnus would be an invaluable
member of the Board of
Trustees.”

Not one member of the board
has been on campus as a
student since the  im-
plementation of the new
academic programs. the
denationalized fraternity
system, desubsidized football
program or coeducation.

aw... “I think the board needs the
added dimension and per-
spective of someone who has
been active here as a student,
during these changes, who has
been involved in campus af-
fairs. and who has demonstra-

‘who could. not

ted a concern about-Davidson. J
think we need that kind of per-
son, and I think T could fill that
need.’’ said Butner.

Director of Alumni Relations
Howard B. Arbuckle III ex-
pressed interest in electing a
slate who would not only
represent alumni interests but
be elected
through other election
procedures such as presbytery
elections.

“We want to be sure we
present a slate*whereby the
talents of that slate will sup-
plement those already on the
board,” said Arbuckle.

He added, “I think there’s a
need for younger represen-
tation.’’ The youngest trustee at
present is 40 years old. The
most recent alumnus on the
board graduated in 1958.

Butner expressed concern
that faculty and students were
not. communicating as closely
with the board as possible.

“Faculty and students are
every bit as much the college as
the board and the ad-
ministration. While the trustees
and the administrators are of
course making policy decisions,
these decisions affect the
faculty and students fundamen-
tally as well.

“The new governance system
being implemented is built on
trust and intercommunication
among all factions of the
college. We must all be willing
to communicate with one
another, and I feel that with my
strong ties with students. facul-
tv. and administrators—and to
a lesser degree Trustees—I
could facilitate the kind of in-
teraction we need to make this
system work,” Butner added.

Butner serves as a member of
the Trustee Governance Com-
mittee, and as chairman of the
subcommittee drafting the
Student Statement of Rights.

Trustees tgnore Gogls’ Committee plea
for permanent long-range planning body

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Staff Writer

“We were labeled a ‘rubber
stamp’ committee; there were
manifestations of tension and
frustration both within the com-
mittee: and on campus regar-
ding the committee’s assigned
responsibilities and the way the
committee when about
discharging them.’’

This statement, incorporated
into the Goals Committee final
report that was completed on
May ist, expresses the self-
realization of tHe problem ex-
perienced in the last four
months of meetings and study.

Upon completion of the final
report, the Committee’s work
ended, and ~-their analysis of
priorities for 1987 at Davidson
was delivered to she Develop:

cur,”’ he said.

“Last vear was the first time
we’d had a carnival in many
vears,”” said Eiler.-“T would
fuess we had well in excess of
2000 people turn out for the
event. an
“T think it was verv suc-
cessful in bringing out a lot of
enthusiasm in the community.
especially among students.’”

ment Committee. of . the
Trustees. After studying the .
report, the Trustees asked
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr, to bring his plans
for 1987 to the Fall meeting for
consideration.

Vice-President for Develop-
ment Craven Williams com-
mented, ‘‘I don’t think that any
of the recommendations that
came out of the Goals Com-
mittee report were unexpected
or dramatic.’’ However, if not
dramatic, the results were quite
specific for a committee that

‘admitted being ladened with

‘‘manifestations of tension and
frustration.”’

The Committee believes that
by 1987 the College’s profile will
include ‘‘a strong faculty com-
mitted to the highest quality of
undergraduate education in the
arts and_ sciences,’”’ ‘‘a

coeducational, residential com-
munity with a commitment to
education within the Christian
tradition,”’ opportinities for
learning and service outside the
classroom both on and off cam-
pus, and a ‘‘strong independent
college.”’

The Committee suggested
strongly that a permanent
group. ‘‘charged with the
responsibility for continuous,
long-range, educational plan-
ning be created.” The report
added, ‘It became apparent
that the college does not have a
formal procedure whereby a
group of students , faculty and
administtators can formulate a
long-range, educational plan for
the college and can monitor
continuously all planning and
decisions with the view of
keeping within the master plan
or making appropriate

revisions of the master plan.’’

As yet the Trustees have not
appointed such a committee, °
however concernng' the
Trustees’ appointment of Spen-
cer to summarize plans and
bring them to the Fall Board
meeting, Williams commented,
“I think it’s proper for the
Trustees to deal with the
College through the President.”’
Williams expects that Spencer
will consult widely throughout
the community during the sum-
mer.

The Goals - Committee
suggested that new programs
be created only when they have
been funded in initial and in
continuing operational costs.
They also suggested that the
College construct physical
facilities only when they have
funds both for the initial costs
and for maintenance thereafter.

The Committee suggested
that Davidson place more em-
phasis on its liberal arts
program as preparation for
“solid vocational employment”
and that Davidson’s emphasis .
on preparing people for
graduate “and professional
schools be set in a more balan-
ced perspective.

Further recommendations by
the Committee included careful
evaluations tostrengthen worth-
while educational programs.
to reduce over-expanded ones,
