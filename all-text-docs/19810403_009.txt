A day in the life of Fred the dog

_ By JOHN KROTCHKO

There’s nobody at Davidson
like Fred!

There are dogs and there are
dogs and dogs on campus: big
ones, small ones; striped, spot-
ted and plain ones; brown-eyed,
blue-eyed and cross-eyed ones;
swift runners, slow limpers and
easy walkers (I don’t mean hush
puppies). But there’s just no-
body at Davidson like Fred!

Unless you’ve been cloistered
in the library all year, you can’t
have missed the little cream-
and-white colored mutt trotting
proudly about campus with a
far-away, aloof look in his eyes.
He looks like the third genera-
tion product of some bizarre
menage-a-trois relationship a-
mong a collie, a pomeranian and
a husky, and he’s shaped some-
thing like a slightly abused shoe
horn. That and
the ear flopped lazily over on
one side make Fred unmistak-
able.

Nancy Wright, a senior who
lives at one of Fred’s major
hangouts, Derby House, dis-
closed Fred’s spring schedule:
Genetics at nine, Invertebrate
Field Zoology at eleven, and
Computers and Statistics at
one.

Fred periodically audits just
about every class in Dana
Science Building, so I asked
Physics Professor Robert Man-
ning what he thought of having
a dog show up for his lectures.
“He wanders into Astronomy
now and then,” he said, and
added lightly, ‘‘He’s at least as
capable as thirty-five percent of
the students in there and cer-
tainly as awake as eighty-five
percent of them.”’

Nobody I talked to could
remember where Fred came
from. Although he was probab-
ly abandoned, like most cam-
pus dogs, his academic yearn-

ings may be telltale signs of a
beloved student who owned him
in years past. Most students,
however, rémember him as
appearing last fall.

Since then he’s carried a
number of names. His first
popular appellation was ‘‘Ban-
jo,”’ contributed by sophomore.
bohemian Bret Logan, who has

a penchant for calling dogs
weird names (he calls the big
English Setter on campus either
“Clam’”’ or ‘‘Intense’’). Then,
Fred started soliciting Esther
Bruce and the girls on third
Little for food. ‘‘I was in a
phase when I called everything
Frederick,’’ Bruce explained.
‘‘He was just a Frederick.’’
most everyone else agreed, and
the name stuck, leaving Bruce
free to pass on to her phase
when she called everything
Kate...

Fliers appeared in December
asking a kind soul to take care
of Banjo during Christmas, but
the break came and the dog,
then in failing health, was still
homeless. Appropriately
enough, Dean of Students Will
Terry took him home for Christ-
mas. “‘Fred,’’ Terry observed,
“|, .is very solicitous.”

Terry fed Fred and Fred
happily followed Terry every-
where. But Terry initially failed
to recognize one of the major
aspects of Fred’s independent
lifestyle. ‘‘Fred’s only problem,’
Terry said, “is when he gets
excited he’s not overly house-
broken. We had some words
over that.’’

After break, Fred virtually
forgot the man who had kept
him from starving for two
weeks. That’s one aspect of
Fred’s personality that almost
everybody notices: ‘‘he thinks
he can ignore those who have
treated him well,’’ complained
sophomore Cathey Bost, who
Fred recently dumped for Nan-
cy Wright’s lovely dog Corti.
They had been carrying on up
on fourth Cannon, Cathey said,
but ‘‘he tried to cool things off
when we started getting seri-
ous.”

‘‘He’s the cutest, sweetest
dog around,’”’ Terry told me,
but went on to describe Fred as
‘‘winsome, manipulative, en-
dearing, fickled.’’ Still, all in
all, he had to admit: ‘‘How
could anyone hate Fred?”

Of course Fred knows this
better than anyone. ‘‘His best
asset is his charm,’’ Wright
said, ‘‘and he. uses that to the
fullest. What he wants, he

gets.”’
_ ‘Lately he’s been a little
cocky,’’ sophomore Mark Mur-

rey agreed. That’s probably
because Murrey has adopted
Fred and feeds him down at KA
every night. Mark answered the
fliers that pleaded for Banjo last
term. No sooner had he done so
that he was initiated into Fred’s
confidence in a rather strange
way. He was taking a test in his
Biology 31 class one day when
Fred entered the room and
approached his desk. ‘‘He threw
up right next to my foot,”’
Murrey recalled. ‘‘That showed
his loyalty or something, I
guess.”’

Murrey took Fred home to his
farm in Pulaski, Tennessee for
Spring break, where the first
thing Fred did was roll in a
“cow pile.’’ Murrey took this as
a very positive sign and would
have left Fred on the farm, but
the dog wouldn’t leave his side

until their return to Davidson.
Murrey plans to take Fred back
to the farm for good this
summer.

What attracted Murrey to
Fred? ‘‘He’s just sort of an
affable type guy,’’ Murrey said.
“That and the ear.”

Craftsmen make cherry oak sing at Blakely Organbuilders

By JOHN HARTMAN
Staff Correspondent

Many people are surprised to hear that
there is an organ builder in Davidson.
For some reason, organs seem to be
associated with large factories, and are
seen as the results of unimaginative
assembly lines and mass production.

But a trip down Depot Street to
Blakely Organbuilders easily dispels this
image. Here the intricate, demanding,
and venerated tradition of organ con-
struction is perpetuated every day by a
handful of local folks in a small,
two-room workshop.

Ralph Blakely, ’67, originally from
Rock Hill, South Carolina, and Sam
Gardner, '74, of Moultrie, Georgia,
constitute the wit and wisdom behind
this operation. Their business came to
fruition in 1976 after beginning as an
organ tuning and maintenance service.

Blakely has spent a number of years

in Europe, studying the construction
and history of the organ, resulting in
strong ties between his work and its
historical roots. As one might guess, he
is a.talented and accomplished organist.

According to Rita Freimanis (who,
along with Robert Tinkham and. Tina
Anderson completes the roster of full-
time associates), building a medium
sized organ from the ground up takes
from 12 to 18 months.

Nearly every operation necessary to
organ construction, following centuries-
old customs, goes on right in the shop.
Some of these responsibilities are dele-

gated to the seven Davidson students —

who each work several hours a week
there.

Two aphorisms, indicative of both the
humor and serious craftmanship of the
organ builders, are often heard during a
day’s work at the organ shop: ‘You
never know how big a mess you can

make until you have made it,” and “If
it doesn’t look good, it won’t work.”

By learning from these truths, Blake-
ly, Gardner, and friends have been able
to turn out a product which meets
demands from as far away as Lexington,
Kentucky. Most of their work centers in
North and South Carolina, however.

Of course, come operations, such as
making all sizes of boards, are carried
out with the help of modern power tools,
but hand planes, chisels, gouges and
other more traditional instruments are
the technological mainstays of the shop.
Some of these are as steeped in tradition
as the art that they produce.

As various wind chests, pallet boxes,
consoles, keyboards, stop actions, and
pipes take their shape from stacks of
poplar, cherry oak and rosewood, the
hands at the workshop begin to set up
the.organ right there.

This can go only so far because of

space limitations, however. So an organ
is never completely built until it has been
packed in pieces and hauled to its, final
home, usually a church or college.

At this point, installation is also
handled by people from the shop.

In a time of mass production, corpor-
ate subsidies, and sacrifice of quality for
the sake of profit, a look at Blakely
Organbuilders is refreshing. One finds
that the vital link between crafteman
and craft still exists, and tradition is not
just for those who can’t come to grips
with the present.

So when you next hear something
about the organ shop, don’t. think of
guys in leisure suits with marketing
degrees pushing melodie makers and big
note songbooks.

To see what you should picture
instead, try the second door on the left,
two up from the Briarpatch Press.
