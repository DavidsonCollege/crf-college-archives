NUMBER 4

Davidson moves up 6 spots in US News’ annual rankings

By Leigh Rawdon

On September 27, American
consumers can flip through the
pages of U.S. News and World
Report and find that Davidson
ranks 12th of American liberal arts
colleges in their 1994 report. No
othersouthern college ranks higher.

Last year's report ranked
Davidson six positions lower at
number 18. U.S. News senior edi-
tor Robert Morse, who directs the
survey, attributed the jump to the
relativity of other schools! perfor-
mance,

“Everything is relative to what

other people do. You can move up
ifother schools are falling,” Morse
said Friday.

Thesurvey directormentioned
also the addition of new factors as
a possible contributor for the dra-
matic change. The magazine now
studies graduate satisfaction as an
entirely new category and class
size as a variable in faculty re-
sources.

Davidson ranked 25th in
alumni satisfaction and 30th in fac-
ulty resources this year as opposed
to the 51st 1993 ranking. Other
variables included in faculty re-

sources are student faculty ratio,
faculty salaries, number of part
time faculty, and percentage of
professors holding the highest de-
grees.

Dean Robert Williams, Vice
President of Academic Affairs,
speculated Friday that the higher
overall ranking might result from
improvement in faculty salaries or
the endowment.

About the 12th ranking, Will-
iams said, “It’s a list we’re always
delighted to be on.” Though he

Ortmayer
recognized
with N:C.
CASE award

By Jay Jennings

The Council for the Advance-
ment and Support of Education
(CASE) announced on Monday,
September 20 that Dr. Louis
Ortmayer is the North Carolina
Professor of Year. Ortmayer, a
bee science professor at

avidson,..became. theeighth...

Davidson College professor to be
selected for a CASE award since
1985. No other college or univer-
sity comes close to Davidson’s
record of eight winners.
Ortmayer said that the award
is a “great recognition.” He has
been flooded with calls over the
last week from colleagues, friends,
and former students giving him
congratulations. He is especially
proud of the award, because it rec-
ognizes his teaching skills, to which
he directs most of his energy.
Ortmayer’sresearchin the last
couple of years has centered around
his case study teaching method.
He uses this method in his Ameri-
can Foreign Policy class. Case
method teaching uses a specific
event or policy and then allows the
students to use inductive reason-
ing instead of deductive reason-
ing.

discussion in class, which is fol-
lowed by informal discussions out
of class. The students discover the
theories for themselves rather than
having them taught by the profes-
sor.

His research on case method
teaching allows for connections
with former students. For example,
he is working now with a former
Davidson College graduate work-
ing in Germany on a case study.

Also, he co-wrote two case
Studies with a student who gradu-
ated last year on the effect the
embargo on Haiti had on refugees.
The success of his past students in
the political science field shows
the effectiveness of Ortmayer’s
teaching method.

Women's weekend aims for solidarity

Rusk, Connor, WH work together to maintain 3 strong houses

By Meg Wolff

With the passing of “Women’s
Weekend,” a celebration of 20
years of women at Davidson anda
chance to acquaint freshmen
women with the eating hause sys-
tem, many are wondering about
the future of women and of
women’s eating houses on Patter-
son Court.

As Rusk house president Jill
Bennett points to the mobility of
people between houses and the
growing numbers of previous in-
dependents that have recently
joined, it appears that the eating
house system is flourishing, even
growing. But recent concerns fo-
cus on the decreased membership
in Warner Hall, leading tospecula-
tion about the possibility of Warner
having to close down.

Warner Hall president Bailey
Foster and other members of the
house are not dismayed over
Warner's small size, pointing to
increased house unity and enthusi-
asm which are generating fund-
raising and social ideas. Foster
says, “Warner’s small size has
inspired us to make some organi-

zational changes that have needed
to be made for years.” Foster says,
“We don’t want to ever talk about
Warner Hall closing.”

Foster thinks that “if any one
of the houses closes it will be a real
loss to Davidson women, because
women here have such limited op-
tions anyway, with only three
houses.” Bennett concurs by say-
ing that “more choices are always
better - so three eating houses are
naturally. better than two.” Presi-
dent of both Patterson Court Coun-
cil and Connor House, Julie Petty
says that the court is focused on
“sustaining three strong women’s
eating houses offering different
options for women.”

Patterson Court Council is
focusing this year on presenting
the women’s eating houses as a
group, but Petty acknowledges that
there are “definitely differences.”
She says, “All the houses are ap-
pealing. It is up to the woman to
choose which house is best for
her.” Bennett sums up by saying,
“It has always been a goal to get as
many women involved in Patter-
son Court as possible, and two

eating: houses simply couldn’t
handle it all.”

Despite problems between the
houses in the past, the house presi-
dents are working to promote
greater unity on the court, espe-
cially among the women’s houses.
Foster thinks the growing unity is

-a positive thing: “There is no way

we can’t all benefit from unifying
and supporting each other.” Foster
thinks there is no need for compe-
tition between houses: “That’s why
we chose houses over sororities.”

However, Fosterconcedes that
