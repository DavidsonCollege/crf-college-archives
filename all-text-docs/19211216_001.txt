Wilson’s Accomplishments
Cover Very Large Field

Dr. T. W. Lingle Writes of Him as
Student, Teacher, Author, Pub-
lic Servant.

As Student

Mr. Wilson took his Bachelor’s de-
gree at Princeton, just as Messrs. Roose-
velt and Taft did at Harvard and Yale,
respectively. He later graduated from
the Law Department of the University
of Virginia, just as MreTaft did at Yale.
Here the parallel ceases, for at this
point Mr. Wilson’ entered upon a real
university course at Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, such as the other two men never
undertook, and such as no other insti-
tution in America at that time was pre-
pared to offer. Mr. Wilson was one of
the early ‘students to receive the then
much coveted degree of Doctor of
Philosophy from the country’s first real
university. .

As Teacher

It was in a college for women that Dr.
Wilson, like M. Clemenceau, in France,
made his debut as a professor. From
Brwyn Mawr he passed in succession to
Wesleyan University, in Connecticut,
and to Princeton University, with which
latter he remained connected for a
period of 20 years, the last eight as pres-
ident. of the university, terminating his
career there in 1910. While a professor
at Princeton, Dr. Wilson practically
created the first department of Politi-
cal Science as it now exists in American
universities, and here he attracted more
attention as a class room lecturer in
that department than any other man in
America.

While president of the university Dr.
-Wilson conceived ‘the famous precep-
torial system and introduced it into
Princeton. As one of his many progres-
sive measures he undertook to demo-
cratize student life at Princeton, en-
countering here the naughtiest problem
he had yet struck, attracting the atten-
tion of the nation to his ideals of dem-
ocracy and his efforts to realize them
on aristocratic ground.

As Author.

Before receiving his Doctor’s degree,
Mr. Wilson was contributing articles on
economic and political topics to learn-
ed publications, and at the age of 28
he awoke to find himself a national fig-
ure in the field of scholarship, by the
publication of his treatise on “Congres-
sional Government.” The enlargement
of this‘work into “The State” during his
further studies at Brwyn Mawr and at
Wesleyan, brought Dr. Wilson into touch
with the great Oxford scholar, Mr.
Bryce, who had long been working in
the same field. From that day to this,
each of these men has found in the other
an ardent admirer.
long before Dr. Wilson entered public
life, the writer, engaged in educational
work in South America, observed “The
State” and other works of Dr. Wilson on
sale in French edition in the windows
of bookstores of Rio de Janeiro, Sao
Paulo, and other cities.

Dr. Wilson’s monumental work is his
four-volume edition of American His-
tory published by Harper Brothers.
This work was written from original
sources, and contains many rare cuts and
engravings. The writer ‘was several
times in the home of Professor Wilson
while a student at Princeton, at the
time that the great historiacl work was
being prepared, and was shown by

Conference.

Dr. J. M. McConnell Writes of Three
Great Achievements at
Peace Meet.

There were many fortunate circum-
stances in connection with America’s
part in the World War. The issue of
the war had come to be the cause of
human freedom, the underlying princi-
ple of the government of the ‘American
Republic; fired with the spirit of cru-
saders fighting to right a great wrong
and to preserve justice in the world, our
soldiers performed deeds of valor that
astounded the military powers of Eu-
rope; our resources in men, material,!
and money, were to be decisive in the’
struggle, and to give us a position of in-!
fluence and leadership such as few na=
tions have ever enjoyed. The most for- |

,;tunate circumstance of all, however, at-_
| tending our participation in the great

adventure, was the fact that Woodrow
Wilson was our President.

For leadership in a fight for the politi-
cal principles of the Anglo-Saxon race
and for a world peace settlement when
victory had been won, Woodrow Wil-
son, by heritage, training, experience,
loftiness of ideals and character was
probably the best fited man in, the United
States. When he took ship.for Europe
in December, 1918, and landed in France
a few weeks later, he was the recognized
leader of the world, not only because
he was the representative of America,
but because in his speeches/on the issues
of the war, and of the peace, he had
given expression as no one else to what

the heart of mankind everywhere believ-
ed to be right and just.

Dr. Thornton Whaling Traces the
Interesting Line of His
School Life.

Mr, Wilson delights to say that his
own father was his first and greatest
teacher. According to his own account
he discoved he had a mind when a boy
fourteen years of age or less, attending
his fathers prayer meeting in Augusta,
Ga.
of lectures, explaining the reasoning of
Apostle Paul the Epistle the
Romans, when the boy actually discov-
ered that he could think and his intel-
ligence was aroused at perceiving the
chain of logical argumentation develop-
ed by his gifted father in these mid-week
lectures. “These dissertations might put
to sleep Godly elders and deacons and
pious Mothers of Israel, but it would be
worth while to do this if the preacher
could wake up the intelligence of gift-
ed and promising youth, like young Wil-
son,

While visiting Columbia some years
apo he asked to visit his father’s class-
room and said, “I used to come with my
father to his class-room when a little
and IT think IT got much he was
teaching there, and [ hope T have it yet.”
Upon visiting the “T

said, “There is nothing T remember bet-

influences, the life there.” From
the standpoint of the philosophy — of

fant year in his life than the year ‘spent
at Davidson, He has told frequently up-
on the stump, an incident which happen-
ed at Davidson College, when, as one of

of profanity when excited: he got back
of Wilson and shouted, “Run, Wilson,
like the Devil that ball
is hit; Run like the Devil L say.” The
man at the bat hit the ball, and Wilson
trotted nonchalantly along if not
nindful of the tremendous issue that
was at stake. The ball was thrown to
the home base, when he was perhaps
three feet from making his run. The
stalwart captain could not: refrain him-

grin which his countenance to
this day under similar appropriate
circumstances; and the sympathy of a
large number of the lower classmen of
the Old College was with the stalwart
captain in his fit characterization of the
failure of the future President to make
the proper run.
