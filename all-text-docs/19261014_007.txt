THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 14, 1926

CHANGE IN DEGREES TO BE
CONSIDERED

The faculty of Davidson College will!

recommend to the board of trustees of
this institution at its midwinter meet-
ing in February that a change in degrees |
conferred be made. The college now |
grants four: two for bachelor of arts,
and two for bachelor of sciences. Feel-

merce, they will recommend that this
one be changed to a bachelor of science
degree in commerce. It is believed that
this will be accepted by the trustees,
since the instructors of Davidson are
hetter acquainted with the local situation
and will only make this recommendation |
after considerable delibetation.

Good taste and good health

The use of Wrigley’s chew-
ing gum after every meal takes
care of this important item of
personal hygiene in a delight
ful, refreshing way — by clear-
ing the teeth of food particles
and by helping the digestion.

The result is a sweet breath that

WILDCATS MEET STATE

(Continued from page 1)

| Coach Younger said that the Wolfpack was
| better than most people thought, that they
| should have beaten Clemson to a frazzle and
are really two touchdowns better than P. C.

Most of Davidson's varsity was sitting on
the bench Saturday when Guilford invaded
Wildcat ‘territory. Joe McConnell did not
enter the game at all. Dick Grey ran in to
dropkick a field goal, but was yanked im-
mediately: Charlie Ritchie did not figure
in the line-up as did several others. The 19
substitutes used by Davidson gave all the
| men a good rest, and the coaches were not
| taking any chance on having any more of
| them injured.
| All during this week the men have been
{trained to break up passes. This has been
a noticeable weaknes on the part of the
Wildcats to date. Fear of McDowall has
; caused the Davidson mentors to put consid-
erable time on this phase of the gridiron
game, as this member of the Wolkpack has
the reputation of one of the best pass-hurlers
in the state. If the Wildcats can break up
the passes of the Wolkpack this year, as
they did in the 1925 season, then they will
have much less worry. The charging line
of the Wildcats last year rushed McDowell
most of the time, with the result that only
three passes were completed out of 23 at-
tempted last October 31, when State was
making a desperate effort to beat the Wild-
cats. But Davidson does not have the fierce

Concord, N. C., October 14, 1926.
Dear Alumnus:
For several years a rapidly increasing
number of Davidson College alumni saw

the great need for a full-time Alumni
Secretary. At our last annual alumni
banquet it was unanimously decided to

employ a full-time alumni secretary. Up-
on motion a committee was appointed to
with all dispatch in
securing a suitable person for this posi-
tion.

possible

After careful investigation the commit-
tee employed Mr. Ernest Milton, who
has proved in every way his admirable
fitness for the position, and the commit-
tee being highly pleased with the work
he has done. If we only had sufficient
funds, we could make Mr. Milton a very
valuable man in this work, using him in
many ways that would be of great help
to the college.

The only means of supporting the office
of the Alumni Secretary, including the
secretary's salary, the income from
“The Davidson College Loyalty League.”
This method of support was approved
without a dissenting voice at our last
annual Alumni Banquet. A yearly con-
tribution of only one dollar makes one
a member of “The Davidson College Loy-
alty League” and every one contributing
that small amount will be enrolled as a

Flower State Club
Has First Meeting

At a meeting held after chapel Mon-
day morning, the Florida Club was or-
ganized this year. The following
officers were elected: P. F. Jones, of St.
Petersburg, President; G. H. McSwain,
of Arcaida; the Yancey twins, of Umi-
talia, Secretary and Treasurer. There
are about thirty members in the club this
year,

for

Last year the club chartered a special
Pullman at Davidson which carried the
men to Jacksonville enmass. There the
men changed trains and went to differ-
ent parts of the state. This car is re-
served for Davidson men and no one is
allowed to enter without the permission
of the boys. It proved a big success last
year and the club hopes to sponsor the
same movement this year.

Among the affairs being planned for
this year is a feed to be held in the near
future. As the club is as yet a young
organization very few plans have been
made besides those mentioned.

MOST STUDENTS ARE
MEMBERS OF CHURCH

Twenty of the 640 students at Davidson
College are not members of any church,
according to announcement made by F.
W. Hengeveld, registrar. This number
is contained in the freshman and sopho-
more every member of the two
upper groups being connected with some
evangelical church,

Since it Presbyterian
that denomination is expected to pre-
dominate. Of the 640 students connect-
ed with churches, 502 are Presbyterians,
while 118 are of other denominations.

HOMECOMING DAY

Say, Mr. Alumni! You haven't
forgotten Homecoming Day, when
Davidson plays Carolina on Rich-
ardson field, and all your buddies
and class-mates will be here to
cheer the Wildcats to victory, have
you? This will be, by far, the
biggest day in the school year. A
big parade by the R. O. T. C. in the
morning, ten thousand people here
in the afternoon for the big game,
—say, you just couldn’t miss that,
could you? Remember that every
one of us is looking forward to
seeing you the thirteenth of No-

vember. Everybody will be here,
from the oldest “grad” to the
youngest “quit.” Don’t let your

place be vacant.

The Davidson eleven is being accompan-

body, a special train being chartered for the |
occasion, with the R. O. T. C. Band being |
sent-by the Athletic Association. Not only ,
has this'day been designated as one of im-
portance by Davidson students’ but every-
thing is in excitement at State. Beside the
Wildcat-Wolfpack game, the agricultural |
students have decided to hold their annual
fair today and at the same time invitations
have been extended to the fathers of the
boys of that institution that they be the
guests of honor.on that occasion.

The fair will be featured by the parade
through the city of Raleigh and promises to
be even better than, in past years. The stu-
derits at State have worked up striking floats
to represent the various departments in the
school of agriculture. The parade will be
led by the military band of the college. With
