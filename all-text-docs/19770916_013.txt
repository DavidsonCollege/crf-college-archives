game since 1970 beating the
Fordham Rams 20—17.

The game was dominated by
the Davidson offense, which
rushed for over 300 yards. The
attack was led by halfback
* Pete Legler who ran for a
game-high 139 yards. Full-
back Page Walley and Half-
back Craig Pyles also played
well, finishing up with 81 and
54 yards, respectively.

When asked about the suc-
cess of the offense, Pyles
praised ‘‘the offensive line for
the great game they played.
They opened holes for us all
day. I hope we can execute as
well this Saturday.’

One disappointing factor in
the game was that the

when they seemingly had a
victory sewn up.

Safety Landis Wade felt the
problem was allowing the big
play. ‘‘We’d hold them for 2
downs and then allow them to
pick up a big play on third
down. I guess it was because
of first game jitters.”’

Perhaps the main factor in
allowing Fordham to cut the

‘lead was the large number of

penalty yards amassed
against Davidson. Many of
these came at crucial junctures
in the game, when the
Wildcats were threatening to
put the game away.

Page Walley pointed out

Freshmen shatter
cake race records

By HARRY GRIFFITH
Staff Writer

John Davis and Nancy
Wright set new records in
their respective divisions in
the annual running of the
Freshman Cake Race last
week.

Davis, of 1st Watts, burned
up the course in 8:25, trim-
ming 8 seconds off of the old
record set by Doug Horn, ’79.

Wright, of 3rd Cannon,
finished in 11:21, taking a
whole 22 seconds off of Paula
Kadison’s record time of 11:43
set in 1975. Nancy comment-

_ed, ‘‘Since the high school
track season ended last year, |
haven’t competed much at all.
It was great to get back into
competition.”’

Remarkably, this years’

intense. We have been really
concentrating on the mental
aspects, in order to cut down
on mistakes. We hope to be
ready for any situation.”
Wade acknowledged this
adding ‘‘I think you’ll see a
big. improvement in this
Saturday’s game against
Washington and Lee.”
“Kickoff time is at 2 pm.

winners came from the same
high schools as the past record
holders: Davis and Horn from
Charlottesville High School,
Va.; Wright and Kadison from
Leon High School in
Tallahassee, Fla.

lst Watts dominated the
race by taking the top three
spots, and grabbing six cakes
in all.

Following Davis were Bart
Landess, also from
Charlottesville High, and
Greg Burnard, one of the top
prep distance runners in
Virginia last year. This trio
will run Cross-Country for
Davidson.

Horn, a hall counselor on
lst Watts, said, ‘‘These three
were recruited by Davidson
and could be the best talent
the cross-country team has
had in many years. The future
of the Davidson cross-country
program is centered in Ist
Watts.”

Davis humbly asserted, ‘‘I
don’t think I won because of
previous training (which was
minimal), but because of the
superb mental preparation
from Doug Horn and Russ
Folger, my hall counselors,
and of course, the thought of a
gaudy, three-layered orange-
coconut cake.”’

Folger added, ‘‘It wasn’t
easy for us getting up at 4:30.
every morning and training,
but it sure payed off when we
got all those cakes.” —
