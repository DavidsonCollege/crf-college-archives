KA’s defend piety
& ‘gracious living’

To the Editor:

I seldom look for a public
platform to express my views,
but I feel that something very
dear to me is under unjustified
attack. I refer to the Kappa
Alpha Order.

There seems to be a mis-
understanding as to what the
KA fraternity stands for,
which is causing some anim-
osity. I hope what I have to
say will ameliorate the situ-
ation.

The Kappa Alpha Order is
founded on the principles of
protecting the weak, support-
ing the righteous, and defend-
ing the honor of ladies, with an
ever conscious sense of piety.
These principles, collated in
the idea of chivalry, were to be
preserved as the essential
aspects of the southern heri-
tage by the founders of the
Order in 1865 at Washington
College. KA is a southern
fraternity in this sense, but I
do not feel that one needs to be
a Southerner, or a KA, to
support our ideals.

The KA’s have a national
tradition, called Old South, to
underline the principles of the
Order. In antebellum costume,
the fraternity reemphasizes
those ideals of our southern
heritage which we wish to
perpetuate. In that sense the

Southern tan

To the Editor:

It is particularly unfortun-
ate that some of the members
of the student body lack the
natural ability to tan properly
without the assistance of boot-
black or mascara. Someone
should also inform them of the
fact that the strength of the
rays of moonlight are not
sufficient to provide the tan
either. The proper attire for
tanning usually includes wear-
ing acceptable beachwear
rather than briefs. One could
catch one’s death, in some
places, because of indecent
exposure. And besides, if you
are mistaken for being black at
the same time, you could be in
double jeopardy.

P.S. It comes as a surprise
to me that real Southern
Gentlemen should behave in
such a manner anyway!

event is a success. Old South
is a very elaborate event,
appropriate for having fun,
and not for accurately recon-
structing the unsavory as-
pects of the time. In this sense
the event is a success. The Old
South on many campuses is an
annual springtime spectacle.
It is a week when the whole
community is invited to relive
the beauty of another era, and
hopefully, when the beauty of
the community itself is en-
hanced by people conspicu-
ously devoted to chivalry and
gracious living. The David-

sonian would have us believe ‘

that the Davidson chapter of
Kappa Alpha failed in these
goals for its Old South, and
instead, conspicuously degra-
ded fellow students. I hope I
am right in believing that the
Davidsonian is the only insen-
sitive party, and that future
Old Souths are enjoyed by all.

Rote imitation squelches creativity

To the Editor:

Just as I am learning new
names and relationships for
things at Davidson I am also
learning new patterns of moti-
vation here also. Whereas the
former are very rational the
latter seems absurd in light of

‘ what I learn rationally.

There are some things that
motivate me tremendously. I
can easily find time to attend
parties, concerts, movies and
eee in protest of sche-
dule changes. Other things are
difficult to get motivated for. I
just can’t seem to find that
one or two hours a week to go
to a Y discussion group, or
work in the community center
or with the scouts or to visit
an old person, a prisoner or a
poor kid. Likewise, I find it
hard to memorize formulas or
detailed names and facts until
test time draws near.

It»seems to me that there
must be some rather basic
reason for such motivational
irrationality. The only reason
I could come up with was in
the unrational way in which
we pursue our primary pur-
pose here at Davidson which is
education. It is rare to get
much credit for creativity here
because creativity is not often
complete without time and

group participation in the
creative act. Asa result, we
almost always learn by per-
haps the only other method we
can which is through imita-
tion.

Our models to imitate are
professors. Professors lecture
and write on the board; stu-
dents copy and return appro-
priate information at the ap-
propriate time. Professors
spend much time ahd effort in
preparing and teaching cour-
ses; students spend much time
in preparing for test, reading
and memorizing course mate-
rial which is usually preorgan-
ized.

Professors complain about
having to work over Easter;
students complain about hav-
ing to come back from vaca-
tion on Monday. Professors
over-schedule their time; so do
students. Professors are dis-
pleased over pay and benefit
students are displeased about
rising tuition and lack of
educational freedom. Profes-
sors think profound thoughts
about the world; students
think profound thoughts a-
bout education. Professors
spend thousands of dollars
purchasing elaborate homes
that fit the American ideal;
students spend thousands of
dollars purchasing elaborate

entertainment.

Imitation seems to lie at the
heart of almost everything I
have learned and am still
learning here academically or
otherwise. Whether it remains
my sole guide for the rest of
my life or not depends, it
seems, on what I do and how I
direct my life now. Imitation
must have been very adaptive
for our hunting-gathering,
small group oriented ancestors
but it is proving terribly
maladaptive for us in the
modern world.

It is true that some of our
models altruistically sacrifice
their psyche and even their
health in attempting to im-
prove some of the absurd and
injust situations that are all
around; and it is also true that

some students sacrifice their
future and careers by leaving
Davidson rather than losing
their integrity or creativity by
following the narrow man-
dates of the school.

Education needs to replace
or at least largely complement
simple imitation with some-
thing else. Whatever that
something else is it is going to
have to be very basic, highly
flexible and support individual
integrity at every level and
step of learning. Unfortuna-
tely, there are no models of
such a system detailed enough
to be imitated, if it could be. It
is going to have to be created.
