“Carter re remains popular in Georgia

To the Editor:

I don’t desire to precipitate an
argument over whether Ford or
Carter should be elected as our next
President, but I do feel compelled to
provide a rebuttal to the distortions
Bill Peeples presented in an article
entitled ‘‘Georgian Doubts Carter's

Intentions’, which appeared in the

October 15 issue of The Davidsonian.
I would hope that our school’s
or would avoid overt bias and
—even an editorial should

have some similarity to the truth.
Essentially, Mr. Peeples made the
following contentions in his article: 1)
“If Carter had been eligible for
reelection for Governor in 1974, few
Georgians would have voted for him."’

2) Carter’s reorganization of the state

government is ‘‘an embarrassing fai-
lure.” 3) Carter’s other accomplish-
ments were only continuations of
policies initiated by preceding gover-
nors. As a native-Georgian, I wish to
briefly address each of the inaccura-
cies.

1. Carter’s popularity in Georgia
was demonstrated convincingly when
-he' received an overwhelming 86
percent of the vote in the state’s
Presidential primary. (Greater than
the home-state vote received by any
other Presidential candidate this
year.) Apparently, only 14 percent of
the state’s voters displayed a dis-
satisfaction with their former gover-
nor; and much of this was simply a

preference for another Georgian favo-

Candidates need more

rite who campaigned heavily in the
state—George Wallace. This affect-
ionate approval of Carter is not just
the product of his national recognition
as a Presidential candidate.

The most objective and authoritar-
ian source I could find, The Almanac
of American Politics—1976, reported
that ‘‘Carter was highly popular
going into the 1974 elections, and
could easily have won a second term.”’

My experience is that the bulk of.

criticism in Georgia of Carter (with
the exception of Republicans, who are
natural opponents) originates from
those people who resented his suc-
cessful efforts in appointing blacks
and women to high government
positions, preserving the natural en-
vironment, upgrading education, and
other “dangerously radical” reforms.

2. When Jimmy Carter became
Governor in 1970, the state govern-
ment was, as confirmed in the
September 18, 1976, issue of News-

ber of state agencies, departments,
and commissions from 300 to 22, not
only saving the state enormously in
administrative expenditures (the ad-
ministrative portion of the state
budget was actually slashed in half!)
but significantly improving govern-
ment efficiency and service. Mr.
Peeples contends that this reorgani-
zation was unsuccessful, presenting
as evidence the fact that when Carter
left office the overall budget had
increased. But if we examine this
situation realistically, we find that
this increase is a result of the
increasing demand in welfare services
and Carter’s expansion in the state’s
prison, mental-treatment, and educa-
tional systems.

discretion in criticism

By LINDA BROCKS TALBOTT

Jimmy Carter’s criticisms of Pres-
ident Ford have developed a strong
and more forceful time. But in his
eagerness to show up President Ford,
he may have stepped too far. Rather
than point out Ford’s shortcomings
himself, Carter should leave that up
to the newspapers.

Carter, who has now taken a
tougher stand on defense spending,
stated that Ford’s citation of a
remark concerning a cut in defense
spending he, (Jimmy Carter), made
during the Democratic race was “' ’’.
Two newspapers have direct quotes
from Carter that he did suggest
cutting defense spending by $15
billion.

Carter then claimed that Ford was
a Marxist when Ford remarked that
the 1968 unemployment figure of 4
percent occurred in a wartime econ-
omy. By linking Marxism to Ford,
Carter hopes to show that Ford is
implying a Capitalist economy flour-
ishes only in a wartime atmosphere.

The most recent criticism of Ford is

that he was brain-washed during his
trip to Poland. Carter bases this claim
on Ford’s recent statement that

Eastern Europe is not under Soviet’

domination. Although this is a defi-
nite slip on Ford’s part, attributing it
to brain-washing, is stretching it a
bit.

Ford, who had moved up in the
polls, is now plagued by recent
mistakes. Besides the Eastern Euro-
pean Issue, he has had to deal with
Secretary Butz's recent ‘‘faux pas”’ as
well as the investigations into his

bank account. Mr. Carter would do |

well to let these problems speak for
themselves.

But Carter is hell-bent on using
them to ridicule the incumbent Presi-
dent. The knife may twist the other
way. Carter, himself may have real-
ized this when he stated in an
interview with the Washington Post
during the Democratic Convention
that he would employ partisan ap-
peals ‘‘as little as possible’ because
partisanship “is not an obsession with
me.’

Indeed, if you compare Georgia's
increase in government expenditures
with other states, the Federal govern-
ment’s, or even the preceding term of
Governor Maddox, the rate of in-
crease under Carter is significantly
lower.

3. The most erroneous contortion in
the article was the statement that
Carter’s predecessor in the Gover-
nor’s office, Lester Maddox, “...ori-
ginally set the other major Carter
programs in motion...conservation
measures, school desegregation, and
other policies.” Much to the contrary,
Maddox violently opposed all actions
for conserving the environment, pro-
posing instead that the scenic Flint

River be damned. And you don’t have
to be from Georgia to know that
Maddox contributed very little in the
institution and maintenance of school
desegregation and good race rela-
tions.

Jimmy Carter's record as Governor
is one of notable achievement and
beneficial improvement in the state
government. While this assertion "
may not be appreciated on a pre-
dominantly pro-Ford campus, I hope
that our ‘‘enlightened” generation can
at least recognize the importance of
treating both sides of an issue with
fairness.

Cooper raps ‘Disco’

To the Editor:

T would like to “second” Richard
Boyce's October 15 editorial. While I
can’t agree word for word with that
analysis of Davidson's ‘“Disco’’ situ-
ation, I, too, sense an inherent
boredom in disco and wonder whether
I may be mellowing too quickly. I
suspect, however, that disco consti-
tutes more of a cultural gap than of a
generation gap, and if this be so,
perhaps the tastes of some less
disco-oriented groups should be con-
sidered by the Union’s programming.

If the reactions of people I have met
are any kind of suitable sample, a
disco-format without the disco
“tunes” could attract many.

‘Maybe the time for a ‘“‘beach’’,
rock, or other disco that would allow a
little creativity on the dance floor has
not yet arrived (or has already
passed), but I feel better having
voiced my objections to the dreary
disco beat and to the accompanying
unoriginal and uninspiring ‘‘steps’’.

CROP fights hunger

To the Editor:

I think many people at Davidson
have hopes for co-operation between
nations and brotherhood that does
not end at the boundaries of a home,
community, religion, or political
system. CROP is one program
available to us here through which we
can begin to actualize these values.

The type of famine relief which
CROP sets up is future-oriented--
teachers, family planning clinics,
seeds, tools, and wages for building
roads and irrigation systems. Since
most CROP teachers and helpers
work without pay and since CROP is
run with a minimum of bureaucracy,
approximately eighty percent of the
funds raised go towards actual
materials for farming and building.

Ten percent more goes into educa-

tional programs. CROP is working
but could use a lot more support from

Davidson people. Every Tuesday
(12:30-1:30) we have a “‘share-it-with-
your neighbor”’ meal in Chambers
Banquet Hall. The price is modest
but your few cents goes a long
way--say, it could buy enough seed to
sow several acres. In November and
April we will be fasting for a day as a
symbolic gesture to raise money for
CROP. For over a billion people
fasting is a way of life; 20 to 25
percent of their children die before
their fifth birthdays. And millions
who do not die lead impeded lives
because their brains have been
damaged, their bodies stunted, and
their vitality sapped by nutritional
deficiencies (statistics from W.W.
Rankin). Organizations like CROP do
make a difference, but need your help.
Please support our programs with
your presence and contributions.

..proposal not in final form

{Continued from page 1]

When contacted, planning commis-
sion members Avinger and Walker,
both professors at Davidson, indi-
cated that they believed the contin-
ued-use label would apply to the
perimeter houses. Burts, in contrast,
advocated classifying the houses as
“non-conforming uses’, subject to
evaluation in five years. Professor
Lester declined to comment, and
commission chairman William I.
Ward, attorney and Davidson resi-
dent, could not be reached for his
opinion.

The proposal is not yet in its final
form. Another hearing will be held

October 28, and the council will vote
soon after that.

“We on the planning commission
believe it is essential that all com-
munity members have the oppor-
tunity to express their opinions on the
zoning proposal,’’ concluded Burts.
