THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 23, 1924

Senior Class Statistics Show
That Psychological Tests Are

Reliable

By Dr. Thos. W. Lingle

A psychological test was first applied to|
all new men at Davidson in September, 1921. |

invoiving 184 men enrolled as Freshmen. |

Since that date these tests have been app ‘ied |

annually to all incoming men.
study no account is taken of the dozen or |
more Seniors who dropped back from a pre- |
ceding class, or who entered advanced stand- |
ing from other colleges. For some reason
12 Freshmen did not take the test, or else
their grades have been lost. Only one of |
these 12 is now here to tell the tale.

The Terman tests were’ Atl offering a!
maximum possible score of 220 points. There
were 45 men whose score was above 171.
These constitute the highest quarteil. Oi
their number, exactly 20 are at Davidson
now in the Senior class. The men of the
second quarteil graded from 170 down to
149 inclusive, involving 46 men, of whom
just 20 are Seniors today. The men of the
third quarteil ranged in grades from 148 to
119. Of these 46 men, 23 are with us to-
day. The 47 men of the lowest quarteil
scored somewhere between 118 and the van- |
ishing point. Only seven of them are here |
now.

Summing up, it appears that we must have |
about seven men in the lowest quarteil of
the Freshman class in order to insure the |
presence of just one man of their number
three years later, and further, that the |
chances of a man in this quarteil to~ remain |
and graduate are about one-third as good as |
those of a man in any one of the

other |
three quarteils.

from honors they have held in student or-
ganizations during these three years,
high grade student works slowly. In the!
psychological test one works against time,
and the slow, painsté iuking student does not
score high.

It is interesting to note that the 20 men |
from the highest quarteil today hold more
than twice as many honors in’ student or- |
ganizations as the men from all the three |
other quarteils combined, showing that stu-!
dents like to choose these high-scorers to!
high office. These 20 furnish today the}

The Davidsonian, The Davidson College +
Magazine, Quips and Cranks (College An-|
nual), as well as the Major Jattalion |
(Reserve Officers’ Training Corps). This |
is only a partial list of honors held by some}

In concluding, it may not be amiss to c: al
attention of social groups on the campus to|
the fact that men who score very low in|
mental tests are not likely to remain for|
graduation, and that if these groups wish to|
have men among their numbers, who shall!
receive honors at the hands of their fellow|
students, they should look very favor: ably |
on that group of men who score high in
psychological tests.

PYRAMID CLUB INITIATES

The Pyramid Club has initiated the

few weeks: Prof. Wm. L. Porter, Wal-

can’t educate a man; he must educate

"himself, and the way he must do it is!

by reading. The most we can do is to
direct that reading.”

ical Choice
of the Careful Buyer

The Ford car delivers more useful, care-free,
economical service per dollar invested than
any other car. Its sturdy, rigid construction
is striking evidence of enduring materials.
Every minute operation is scientifically tested
and accurately checked.

Control of natural resources and complete
manufacture in large volume have made pos-
sible value that is the one standard by which
every motor car must necessarily be judged.

The Ford car is the logical and necessary
choice of the buyer who wants to get
the utmost from every motoring dollar.
