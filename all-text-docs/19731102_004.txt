Avoiding The Narrow Path

We would like to commend
the faculty as a whole for their
well-advised election of
Professors Proctor, Walker,
Manning, Nelson, and Brown
Patterson to work on the 10-
year College Self-study
evaluation.

Instead of selecting a steering
committee which would
represent only the interests of
any one narrow segment of
faculty opinion on various
issues, the faculty selected a
broad slate which will express
the feelings of diverse groups
within the faculty.

Such a selection goes a long
way to refute the allegation
that the faculty is dominated by
one group, for if such were the
case, then as representative a
committee as the Self-study
steering Committee could
never have been created.

This 10-year evaluation is in-
deed very important to David-
son. Out of the study done 10
years ago, came revolutionary
changes that revamped the
whole curriculum.

While not advocating any
radical changes now, we feel
that the committee in the
process of their study might
come up with many new recom-
mendations to further improve
things here.

For example, the whole
method of giving credit to
those involved in foreign study
needs improvement so that it
becomes less difficult to tran-
sfer foreign study credits to
one’s record here.

And as we indicated last
week, the whole concept of the

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

“‘21”’ level course, and more
broadly our whole commitment
to the liberal arts merits
revaluation.

We hope that the committee,
through an honest discussion of
its differences of opinion, may
draw up suitable recom-
mendations in these and in
other areas of the college
programs, for the betterment
of Davidson as a whole.

Goodbye And Hello

We the staff of THE DAVID-
SONIAN would like to express
our most sincere thanks to
Taylor Blackwell, owner and
publisher of the printing com-
pany which handled THE
DAVIDSONIAN, for all the
time and effort he has invested
in our newspaper over the past
six years to insure its success.

For without his advice when
things were going well (which
was almost never), and his
assistance when we were floun-
dering, it is doubtful that we
could have accomplished what
we have.

Taylor always seemed to be
present when we needed him to
assist us in both the technical

and journalistic aspects of put-
ting out a newspaper.

We hope that now that he is
out of the newspaper business,
he will carry out a long
cherished desire to participate
more actively in community af-
fairs.

It is our opinion that in the
same way he offered
generously of his considerable
talents to THE DAVID-
SONIAN, he will do so toward
the community as a whole. In
this new endeavor, he also has
much to offer.

So, we say goodbye to Taylor
Blackwell as a newspaperman,
and hello to him as a com-
munity mover.

Making The Decision On Wildcat Football:
A Catharsis For The College Community

Like the student forced to
make the difficult personal
decision on the morality. of pre-
marital sex, Davidson College
as a collective body has been
confronted over the past four
years with the necessity of
resolving the bitter controversy
over the fate of football here.

In both cases it takes a long,
and often painful, _ self-
appraisal of one’s most basic
beliefs and attitudes on the sub-
ject to resolve the dilemma.
And yet out of each can come
the most satisfying catharsis-
when the weight of making
such a decision is over.

As we hope that the in-
dividual who must make such a
decision feels a purging of guilt
when it is all over, so we fer-
vently pray that the Davidson
community feels that way now
that their ordeal is over. For-
tunately, there are indications
that this is so.

Eades Receives Recognition
For Campus Contributions

To The Editor:

Earlier this week, Todd Eades asked
me to relieve him from his many duties
in student government. Although his
contributions to the SGA have been con-
siderable and his expertise in-
valuable to the last three SGA presi-
dents, I told him that I would respect
his decision and relace his as soon as
possible.

Before he leaves the SGA, I would
like to openly express my appreciation
for the work he has done for the David-
son student body.

During the 71-72 school year, Eades
undertook an awesome task in his
assault on the comprehensive fee plan
as outlined by Mr. Cornell. Members of
the classes of ’74 and '75 will recall that
the plan was eventually altered,
primarily as a result of the work done
by Eades.

For the past three years, Eades’ work
on THE DAVIDSONIAN has been con-
sistently thorough and fair. His
analyses of campus issues have been
superb, and he has displayed an un-
canny ability to explain complex
problems succinctly.

In the area of student government,
Eades has served in numerous
capacities: as SGA parliamentarian,

chairman of the Campus Tax Council,
member of the Student Life Committee
and member of the Senate Executive
Committee. His service in these official
roles has been solid and steady.

His unofficial role as a source of
advice and political wisdom to Danny
Clodfelter, Ralph Peeples, and the
during our terms as student body
president has earned him the respect of
all those who have worked in the SGA
during the past three years.

Unlike most of the ‘‘activists’’ on
campus, Eades has not received much
recognition outside of the groups with
whom he has worked. Despite his ser-
vice and list of accomplishments, his
name has been conspicuously absent
from lists of the ‘‘Who’s Who”' variety.

From my perspective, I can see no
other student at Davidson who has
given so much of himself and yet
received so little recognition.

Eades leaves the Student Govern-
ment Association, and I would like to
thank him publicly on behalf of the
many students who have known him
through the SGA, for his countless
hours of work, numerous contributions,
and for his honest advice and criticism.

Bo Phillips '74
Davidson College

Head football coach Dave
Fagg has stated that he is in
one hundred percent support
with the trustee move to make
all future football scholarships
solely on the basis of demon-
strated need. This belief is a
direct refutation of a recent
story in the ‘Charlotte Ob-
server”’ which strongly implied
that Fagg opposed such a
move.

And as even the most ardent
subsidized-football hater would
have to concede, this is an in-
dication of a strong personality,
for to be able to mold one’s
outlook to a system contrary to
one’s aspirations (obviously
Fagg would rather coach a sub-
sidized team) is quite an
achievement.

While we disagree withFagg’s
outlook on the game (It seems
to us that often the only thing
that matters is winning, rather
than being satisfied in acquit-
ting oneself well on the field.) ,
we can not help but admire his
adaptability.

As for the players them-
selves, the move was greeted
with more than a little bit-
terness. Nothing we can say
will ease that pain; we can only
hope that they will someday un-
derstand that the college had no
other realistic choice. ©

For the money is just not
there to expand the program to
make it competitive with the
other Southern Conference
powers, and to keep the
program like it is would be a
travesty to everyone here. And
so the decision to create a suc-
cessful program on a level that
all can accept was the only
alternative.

The reaction among the rest
of the community has been
good. Spencer and the trustees
seem satisfied, at least for the
time being. And many students
now seem to be willing to go out
in the future and support the
football team again as they did

in the not-so-distant past.

With regard to the way the
news was given to the team
(they got the announcement
from the press rather than
from college officials), we feel
the team was slighted, although
probably unintentionally.

It is imperative that those in
power learn how to announce
such moves in a more dignified
and respecting manner.

The one major problem with
the trustee decision is that as a
result of it the football team
will, over the next three years,
be forced to compete against
subsidized Southern Con-
ference teams at a time when
all their own scholarships will
be running out as the players
graduate.

This may not work out. Very
conceivably at the end of three
years (or sooner) we may find
that we are unable to continue
to do so.

If Fagg is unable to win
against such opponents with the
material he has to work with,
we hope that the trustees will
see fit to get us out of the
Southern Conference  im-
mediately. For what is most
important is that we play on a
level where we stand a
reasonable chance of winning.

We would further urge the
Athletic Department to go
about the business immediately
of scheduling games over the
next three years against
schools with the same calibre
program as Davidson. For we
owe it to the present players to
give them a good schedule.

We affirm our hope that the
days of animosity are over bet-
ween the supporters of a sub-
sidized team, and those who
favor a more limited approach
to the game, so that we may all
once again unreservedly sup-
port the Davidson Wildcat
Football team.
