Fine —_— spurs flickerball fever

By BAD BERNARD and
HOGMAN
Staff Writers

An infectious fever struck
Davidson students this week
as clear skies and warm wea-
ther greeted them and the
opening week of Flickerball
season.

So infectious was this fever
that Bernie gave up stealing
televisions and Hogman put
down his cold PBR to investi-
gate this week’s offerings of
flickerball competition.

Our investigation proved to
be fruitful as this week served
up a number of IMAC firsts.
Field numbers 4 and 5 received
their baptisms, much to the
chagrin of IMAC competitors.

The first IMAC tragedy
occurred on #4 as three people

- disappeared in the craters on
the left side of the near end
zone. Davidson Police were
stymied in their investigative
efforts but did manage to
arrest the entire IMAC office
on negligence charges and had
rape phones placed near all

flickerball fields.
mwalt became the first

forfeit victim of the year and is
only one forfeit away from
being the first ten-dollar con-
tributor to the Graeme
Thompson-Bob Hayman-
Dave Schmidt Bahama Vaca-
tion Relief Fund.

Bert Downs set a personal
first when he managed to

catch and run with a long pass
10r @ touchdown despite inter-
ference from ear muffs on his

‘Kamakazie-style helmet.

Johnny Castleberry and the
East Harlem Whizz Kidds set
an IMAC record by never
running anything but a sleeper
play in their game with the
2nd Richardson Beavers. The
Beavers meanwhile set a re-
cord of their own by never
recognizing any of the Whizz
Kids’ plays.

Said one frustrated Beaver,
“T always thought the sleeper
was a wrestling hold.”

week came when ATO stunned
PAX for its first flickerball
victory in years. The Zeroes
are obviously on. the right
track to building that nation-
ally competitive flickerball
program which they have
sought for a long time. So
much for firsts.

This week’s play did little to
scramble the Bad Bernard and
Hogman Top Ten. Number
one SAE did not play by press
time but retained their hold on
first while KA #1 trounced Up
and Coming 40-7 in spite of an
eight-minute second half.

Dave Pottinger jumped out
to an early lead in the Ragman
of the Year Award while
leading MacFleet and Stuff to
a 58-0 demolishing of Twatts.

Steve Justus and Clayton
Rogers directed a sky-high
Bongs team to a 38-13 drub-
bing of Up and Coming,
forcing students to wonder
where the losers came up with
their name.

The Old Men scored six
early touchdowns while Sum-
walt was scattered hither,
thither and yon about campus
and then hung on for a 36-35
forfeit.

Number Six War Kiwis

STEAKS and
“HOICE WIN

annihilated 4th Richardson
33-0 while Joe ‘‘Legend”’ Win-
kle solidified the FIJI’s hold
on the number seven spot with
a 39-12 defeat of Twatts.

Ray Berberik and Marty
Kreshon each scored twice to
lead Number 8 SPE’s to a 37-6
victory over Son of SOMF.
(Guess what SOMF stands
for?)

Johnny Castleberry took
the number nine spot and the
surprising Bargain Basement
of Richardson took the num-

stomping of PIKA. Credit
John Gerdy’s disciplined con-
trol of his hall for that victory.

The Bad Bernie-Hogman
Top Ten:

. SAE (0-0)

. KA #1 (1-0)

. MacFleet and Stuff (1-0)

. Bongs (1-0)

. Old Men (1-0)

. War Kiwis (1-0)

. FIJI’s (1-0)

. SPE’s (1-0)

. Johnny Castleberry and the
East Harlem Whizz Kids (1-0)
10. Bargain Basement (1-0)

In the minor leagues, the
M&M's, behind Susan David-
son and Sarah Stoneburner,
destroyed the Sugar Bears
16-0. Hiyaki smothered the
Wads of Ruskeller, 34-0, and
Little Killers nipped Sun Mai-
dens, 7-0.

Don’t forget that David-
son’s first Tackle Golf game of
the year is less than a month
away. Some good seats are
available along most fairways
and a few are still left on the
eighth and ninth greens.

Bill McDade and Glenn
Ballard are pre-season all-con-
ference selections for this
year’s team which hopes to
improve on last year’s second
place finish.

For those would-be athletes
not destined for intercollegiate
fame nor satisfied with IMAC
stardom, the rise of David-

from the depths of anonymity
might be the best thing ar-

Formerly an organization
floundering in obscurity under
limited funding, Club Sports
at Davidson have been beefed
up due largely to the hard
work of Director Sterling Mar-
tin and President Ron Rosen-
berg.

Beginning this year the
Club Sports, including foot-
ball, rugby, water polo, hoc-
key, soccer, lacrosse and wat-
er-skiing, will be operating on
school-appropriated funds.
The school will provide half of
each club’s operating budget
while the members of that club
will be responsible for the
other half.

These funds will aid in the
much-needed purchase of
equipment and field prepara-
tion materials while allowing
each club to remain largely
independent of Davidson's
budget.

Club Sports currently in
progress include rugby, foot-
ball, and water-skiing with the
others opening during their
respective seasons.

This space will be the one, to
check for the scores and

orating Masterful Announce-
