HENRY SAPP ELECTED
CAPTAIN G. W. TEAM

The following dispatch was clipped from
the Winston-Salem Journal relative to Henry
Sapp, former member of the present Junior
class of Davidson College:

Washington, D. C., Dec. 6—Henry Sapp
of Winston-Salem, N. C., has been elected
captain of the 1926 George Washington Uni-
versity football team. The team which just
closed the current season was: honored at a

banquet at the Lafayette Hotel given by the
alumni.

Auntie—“So your sweetheart went
away yesterday? Parting is painful,
isn’t it?”

Marge—“I should say it is; every rib
in my body aches.”

““Y” Xmas Service

Will be Different

The Y. M. C. A. plans to put ona special
prgram at the last service befre the Christ-
mas holidays. This service, which comes on
December 20, will be entirely different from
any held so far this year. The Glee Club
will have charge of the program and will
arrange a musical program with appropriate
Christmas songs. There will be no out-
siders on the program, only students taking
part in it. The hall will be decorated in a
fitting ananner to express the Christmas
spirit. The entire program will be a musical
one, composed of selections by- the Glee
Club and songs by the student body.

Just before the holidays the “Y” is going
to send old clothes and athletic equipment to
some of the mountain schools, as has been
done in the past. This has usually been done
around Thanksgiving, but was put off this
year until a little later date. The clothes
are usually sold by the mountain school and
the proceeds used for various needs of the
school,

NEW CAR COLORS

Fifth
street, experienced a new and happy sensa-
tion at the annual automobile salon held at
the Hotel Commodore, New York. Color
was the keynote of the exhibits by builders
of fine motor coach work.
produced by America’s foremost designers
and exhibited on the Lincoln chassis, at-
tracted especially keen interest because of
the fact that the colorings and color com-
binations of rare birds were duplicated.

The enthusiasm of Fifth Avenue was re-
flected in the newspapers of the city. The
New York Times, commenting on the salon,
said: :

“A striking exhibit in respective colors is
that of the Lincoln cars. The rich color
combinations ‘have been adapted from the
plumage of rare American and _ tropical
birds.”

The New York Sun was equally enthusi-
astic, saying:

“The sensational feature of this salon is
the brilliant color effects found in the many
cars exhibited. This is particularly so in the
case of 12 Lincolns, each of which has been
painted in striking and contrasting colors of
a bird selected for its beautiful plumage.
The idea underlying this method of color
selection is-novel and the effects secured are
almost beyond description.”

RED REPLACING BABE RUTH
AS IDOL OF PARIS

Paris, Dec. 9 — (AP) — Harold “Red”
Grange is replacing Babe Ruth as the aver-
age Frenchman’s idea of America’s premier
athlete, owing to the extraordinary publicity
given to Grange’s football fortunes and great
earnings as a professional in the Paris news-
papers.

Le Martin tomorrow will print on the front
page a sketch of Grange’s football career,
illustrated by a large figure wearing a foot-
ball headgear supposed to represent the IIli-
nois star in the flesh. The article contains
this comment:

~fRed Grange is dimming Babe Ruth’s star
as America’s best paid athlete. He has beat-
en the Bambino's record both in the impor-
tance of fame and in the rapidity in which
he achieved it.”

Lord Trampwick—"“Now in my college
days I belonged tothe Order of the Gar-
ter.”

Sorority Sophie—‘How very interest-
ing. Which chapter, Boston, Paris, or
Double-Grip?”

Wildcat Hall of Fame

A-tew days ago the Gastonia High School
football team won the championship of North
Carolina. They did this defeating
Greensboro 10-3 for the western title, and
Sanford 8-0 in the finals.

by

This feat is doubly interesting because of
the fact that this team was coached by “Pat”
Crawford, a former Wildcat.

“Pat” was one of the best athletes David-
son has had in many years. As a Freshman,
he distinguished himself by making the var-
sity baseball squad. From then on he was
in everything. To him is given the honor of
being one of the best guards éver to wear the
Read and Black on a basketball court. As a
first the team, he
brought honor to Davidson by making all-
state for two successive years.

baseman on baseball

He went out for football, and although he
never made the varsity, he showed the true
Wildcat spirit by sticking to it.

In inter-class games, he took an active part,
serving as chairman of several class athletic
committees,

“Pat” did not content himself with merely
having a part in sports; he also was very
active in other things. H[e was a member
of the “Y” cabinet and president of the “Y"
in his Senior year. A few of his honor's
were: Member of the “D" Club, vice-presi-
dent of the student body, Bachelor's club
(Phi Gamma Delta), Eu Society, captain of
both baseball -and basketball varsities, an all-
state man in both sports and an O, D, K.
man,

Davidson will long remember Pat because
he was a true Wildcat in every sense of the
word,

JUNIOR SPEAKING ORATORS

The preliminaries for what promises to
be one of the best Junior Speaking contests
held in recent years will be held next Tues-
\day night in Shearer Hall, when 12 or more
of. the outstanding orators of the class of
1927 will contest for places in the Junior
Speaking contest to be held on a prominent
night during Junior Week next spring.

Within the Junior class are many of the
best speakers on the campus, and their inter-
est in the oncoming contest with their en-
trance as contestants assures a large number
of well-prepared and forcefully delivered
speeches from which to choose. Of the con-
testants in the preliminary contest, six will
be chosen by the judges for the spring
contest.

Of those signifying their intention of en-
tering the contest, an interesting and varied
scope of subjects have been chosen. Harllee
Branch has chosen “Danton the Martyr of
the French Revolution” as his theme. Don
Stewart will use as his theme “Choice Of a
| Leader.” Leighton McCutchen will speak
on “The Oppotunity of America.” Wilbur
Hodgkin’s subject will be “Twentieth Cen-
tury Knighthood.” Gordon McCutchen has
{announced as. his oration “Intellectual Ego-
ism.” C, W. Williams will speak on “Wood-
row Wilson.”

Other members of the class who have sig-
|nified their intention of entering the contest
| but who have not announced their subjects,
include C. G. Davis, R. S. Wilson, R. L.
Mitchell, A. C. Slaymaker, W. C. Ogden,
and W. T. Covington, while there will prob-
ably he others to announce their entrance
later in the week.

“What special studies is your daughter
taking at college?”

“Cigarette inhalation, highball con-
struction, bbing, and g al
cosmetics.”
