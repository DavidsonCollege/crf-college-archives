Ruggers oppressed at tourney

By JEFF MORROW
Staff Writer

The last of the ‘true art form
in sports’ club traversed back
. from the Chapel Hill Rugby
Tournament (Golgotha to its
participants) to the campus
grimacing as they told the
tragic tale of the referee ex-
ploitation during the 10:30 a.m.
and the 2:30 p.m. matches.

Fiery-breathed Mark Arm-
strong screamed, “Why must
all the wrongs of the universe
befall upon our souls?”’
Receiving no answer, he
stalked away, but smiled
slightly at the bruise on his left
forearm where he had ac-
cidently - on purpose clobbered
the referees, rumored to be on
Wake Forest’s and Duke’s side.

In the first game against
Wake Forest, Davidson’s Chris
Young, noted scientist and
athlete, displayed excellent
footwork in the muddy con-
ditions. His winged-feet
movement resembled very
closely that of Perseus, as he
scored the first try, giving
Davidson a four point ad-
vantage. The field goal attempt
was missed by Bob Schermer.

The game was momentarily
stopped to carry Steve Rain-
water off the field because the
swelling from his sprained
ankle was obstructing the field.
Wake Forest scored a try in
the last ten minutes of the
game making the score 4 to 4.

The field goal attempt was
called “no good’’ by line judge
Joe Craig, but “‘good’’ by the

referee. Total score after the
game was Davidson-4, Wake
Forest-4, and Referee-3.

' Duke’s “gray wolf’, a forty
year old rugby veteran, plotted
the overthrow of the match
with the afternoon referee, a
seemingly extremely ignorant

and dull-witted specimen of«

humanity. The two then in-
terjected new rules to the game
as we played.

Victor McMillan was taken
out of the game with a shoulder
injury. But the psychological
advantage for Duke was

quickly leveled by the
Malignant McKenzie and the
Powerhouse Prospere.

While attempting to pass off
to Jud Cultino, Pete Alford took
a\ crippling blow to his left
knee, but still insisted on
playing.

In the second half of the
game Duke scored and made
the field attempt making it.7-0.

The keen sight of the
Ruggers was stifled as a strong
thunderstorm concentrated it-
self on the field. There ‘was so
much lightening that Sheldon
Parker had to be given rubber
shoes because his height was a

_ danger to the other players.

The muddy conditions hin-
dered ‘‘hard-ass’”’ Al Willaims’
moves and the whole game
slowed down to the level of a
mud fight.

Sublime Stick and gnashing
Naslund helped spark the team
with their quick hits, while bold
Benfield and conducive Cook
showed willingness to adminis-
ter proper push in the scrum.

Shooters finish season
with seven match wins

By CHARLES KENNON
Sports Editor

After posting a 7-3 regular
season record, the Davidson
College Rifle Team _par-
ticipated in the Southern Con-
ference Tournament on Satur-
day, March 19. Davidson
finished fifth out of eight teams
in the match.

“Certainly I wish we could
have finished higher in the
match but I’m _ pretty
satisfied”, Captain Abel White
of the R.0.T.C. Department
stated. The rifle team advisor
explained that Appalachian
State, who finished first in the
tourney, is ranked third in the
nation. Davidson is ranked 74
out of 302 teams in the nation.

White continued, ‘These
other teams have full-time
coaches and stress shooting.

Everyone on our team per-:

formed in an outstanding man-
ner.’’ The top five Cat shooters
at.the match each shot above

500 out of 600 possible points.
The total team score was 2547
out of 3000 points.

The high scorer for Davidson
was senior Bob Anders with a
524. Next was freshman Tom
Miller with a 515 and
sophomore Ben Simms with a
505.

“We return almost all our
best students for next year. I
won’t be returning next year
but whoever manages it should
have the basis for an excellent
team,”’ White said. He is being
reassigned to Germany this
summer.

White concluded by saying
that Dallas Kirkendal was
voted the team Most Valuable
Player by the coach and team
meer, ;

The game ended Davidson-0
and Duke-7.

The team was overwhelmed
by the heavy weight of the idea
that corruption was beginning
to come into the last stronghold
of “‘true sport”’.

But when they heard the wor-
ds of John Henry Newman, a
new enlightenment flourished
in their hearts; ‘‘the palaestra,
in ancient times like in the
Olympic games, in which
strength and dexterity of body
as well as mind gained the
prize,”’

ticipated in the regatta.

Francis and Chuck

Barrineau crewed the David-. ©

and Phil Cain in the B Division
boat.

“Our team is just . inex-
perienced. We’re competing
against people ,who’ve been
sailing for 10 or 15 years,’’ said
Francis.

Eight races were sailed at |

the Charleston regatta, four by
Division A sailors and four by
Division B sailors.

“During the regatta, our
inexperience in the strong
‘Charleston tides (at the Citadel
meet) caused us_ severe

ticipating in the regatta,

remarked Francis.
“Unfortunately, we attendea

the Charleston regatta’ with
less preparation than we ~

~ desired.

“Because of all the rain we
had no practices before the
regatta,” said Francis.

Bill Beasley was elected

-team commodore and Tommy

Lee was named team treasurer
in recent elections of the sailing
squad. .

' The sailing team has planned
seven regattas during spring
term.

The Davidson sailing team

_ will meet Duke on March 29.
