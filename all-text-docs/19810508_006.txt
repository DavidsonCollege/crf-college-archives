6—The Davidsonian—May 8, 1981

Inside IMAC

The softball tournament began this week and will continue
into the early part of next week. As I was looking over the
pairings for the tournament I couldn’t help but feel that the
IMAC Czar had not handled the final task of his reign properly.
He put the five best teams in the top bracket. This would be
understandable only if the pairings were handled by draw
selection, which they were not.

The top teams should have been divided up as evenly as

possible, with the top two
teams in separate semifinal
brackets in order to allow them
to meet in the finals. Double
elimination goes into effect for
the final four teams.

I still feel confident that Bone
will win the championship, es-

v* pecially after their victory over
the Perpetual Perpetrators (10-7) which moved them into the
final four. According to Perpetual Perpetrator member Danny
Klinar, the game could well have been the final round of the
tournament, which of course never would have happened if the
pairings had been assigned fairly.

The results so far are: ~
‘’ Eddie Searcher over PhiDelt (9-8)

Bone over Perpetual Perpetrators (10-7)

Master Batters over Pissin in the Wind (13-2)

Old Men over Off Again (19-9)

So, the final four are Eddie Seracher, Bone, Master Batters,
and the Old Men. Remember, the tournament is now in double
elimination. Good luck to all the teams. I still think Bone is
going to win. If you want to see some good softball, check the
schedule in the gym for the times and field numbers.

Since this is the final issue of the Davidsonian, I will not be
able to cover the rest of the tournament. But remember, next
fall comes...flickerball! . _

Lack of scholarships hurts sports

By JIM CROWE
Sports Editor

Davidson minor sport coaches say their teams
could compete against the scholarship-supported
squads of other schools if they were given more
support in recruiting from the college admini-
stration. _

Davidson awards scholarships for men’s bas-

ketball only, while offering substantial financial

assistance to football players with established

Athletic Director Gene Bingham said, ‘‘The
way inflation’s going, the policy in athletics

_ across the nation is retrenchment. Lots of schools

are giving up many sports, both men’s and
women’s. Everybody’s in trouble.’’

Davidson minor sport coaches say they know
that Davidson cannot afford big-money scholar-
ships. However, most say that scholarships may
not be the miracle answer to Davidson’s present
athletic questions.

Hockey and women’s basketball coach Dee Dee
Mayes said, ‘‘Our problem in basketball is that
schools in the conference we’ve played in the past
don’t have the strict admissions policy we do, so
we're going to need some help there, or change
our schedule.’’ Mayes proposed that the admis-
sions office reserve two spots for each minor sport
every year for qualified athlete-students who
might not gain admission on strict academic
credentials alone.

Mayes also said that recruiting budgets for
minor sports are inadequate. ‘‘It really won’t do
us all that much good if they give us scholarships
but not the money to go visit players and see
them play. .

Pat Miller, who coaches both the swim team

and women’s tennis team, also pointed to the
recruiting budget as a source of concern for
coaches. Miller said that recruiting budgets for
minor sports, which in 1980-81 stood at less than
$92 per sport, must also cover the cost of all
phone calls, mailings, and paperwork done by the
coaches in matters of scheduling and conference

relations. 7)
Although the admissions office has beén
cooperative in the past, Miller added, ‘‘We do

need definite slots in admissions for at étes who
can meet certain requirements for sions.’
She said a change in udmissions policy would
have two effects. ‘First, at least then we would
know that if we find the kids we need we could get
them in, and two; it would be good for the coaches
as far as motivation goes.”

Golf Coach Thom Cartmill said that all other
golf teams in the Southern Conference offer
scholarships. Cartmill said, ‘‘We can compete
with these teams without [offering Davidson]
scholarships, it we get the rest of the tools.” He
said that Davidson badly needs a good practice
facility near the campus. Presently, the team
travels over 30 minutes to practices.

Also, Cartmill said that golf teams Davidson
competes against are often allowed up to 30 days
of missed class time. ‘‘We just can’t do that at
Davidson, so we’re at a disadvantage there, but
that situation is not going to change.”

Baseball Coach Charlie Slagle said, ‘‘It is
difficult to compete day in and day out with
scholarship teams.’’ But he added, ‘I’m not
really expected to win all my games, competing at
this level. The Athletic Department just tells you
to do the best you possibly can. The pressure to
win really is put on me by me.”’

Cat golfers end season with 3-1 dual meet record

By JIM CROWE
Sports Editor

Davidson golfers finished a
fine 3-1 dual meet record season
with the 54-hole Southern Con-
ference 1981 golf championships
held April 27, 28, and 29. The
tournament was conducted over
the 6560-yard, par 70 South
Course! at the Raintree Country
Club in Matthews, North Caro-
lina.

Senior Brett Storm took low-
medalist honors for the Wild-
cats with rounds of 79, 75, and
78, for a 232 finish. Storm tied
at number 20 on the list of
individual leaders with Greg
Campbell of the Citadel.

Eric Lawhorn of East Ten-
nessee State, who shot a sec-

ond-day round of 67, led all
individuals with a 214 score.

Davidson finished seventh of
nine teams with a score of 1206,
while East Tennessee State won
the tournament with an 1101
finish. East Tennessee’s team
title was the Buccaneer’s third
straight, matching the record
held by Davidson (1966, 1967,
1968), George Washington, and
Furman.

Three Davidson players fi-
nished at 241—senior L.D.
Simmons (79-75-87), senior
Mark Shogry (83-78-80), and
junior Mott McDonald (84-77-
80). Sophomore Tom Haller
knocked out a 254, while senior
Rick Jenkins folllowed with a
255.

Freshman Dave Lincoln,
sophomore Bob Whalen, and
senior Ed Imbrogno have play-
ed in the number seven, eight,
and nine spots, respectively, for
Davidson this year.

Davidson competed in four
dual meets this season, emerg-
ing with a 3-1 record, and
participated in the Dunlop,
Elon, Pembroke State, Virginia
Tech, and Southern Conference
tournaments.

L.D. Simmons staged the
highlight of the year when he
stroked past the 162-player field
of the Elon Tournament to take
the individual low-medalist
honors in that event.

Cartmill said he was pleased
with the team’s improvement
this year.

Davidson lacrosse team ends season at 5-3

By STEVE SOUD
Staff Writer

The Davidson Lacrosse Club
finished its second straight
winning season as Player-Coach
senior Alex Evans guided the
team to a 5-3 record.

The season opened with a
road game at Clemson, where
the host Tigers came out on top,
9-6. The team then dropped to
0-2 as Guilford’s varsity team
demolished the visiting Wild-
cats 19-4.

The season turned around

. when the team played Furman,

their first game before the home
folks. The visitors battled back
from an early deficit regulation
in a 9-9 deadlock. Alex Evans
was the man of the sudden
death overtime, as he dodged
four defenders to score and give
the Cats their first win, 10-9.

The stickers easily handled

Charlotte Lacrosse Club, paced
by the three goal effort of senior
Tom Baker. The team then
stretched its win streak to three
games as senior crease attack-
man Andy Engh scored the
deciding goal in the waning
minutes of the 8-7 game.

Next, the team traveled to
“Hotlanta” to meet the Yellow
Jackets of Georgila Tech on the
astroturf of Grant Field. Sharp
Georgia Tech passing proved
too much for the Wildcats
defense, unused to: the ‘‘fast’’
astroturf, as Bobby Kurin
scored eight of the Yellow
Jackets’ sixteen goals. The bees
stung the Wildcats 16-5.

A key turnabout came as the
team won its first road game on
the bumpy: field of Elon. The
Wildcats raced to a 9-1 halftime
lead, and finished off the Fight-

ing Christians, 12-5.

The season finale against
Emory and Henry proved to be
Davidson lacrosse at its best.
The Wildcats, looking for a
blowout, surged to a 4-1 lead,
but slacked off with tre lead in
their hands. Emory and Henry
rallied to take a 5-4 lead. The
’Cats pulled things together,
though, and finished the visi-
tors off 12-10.

Although the team is grad-
uating the entire starting attack
prospects for next year are
good. Goalies Jay Norman and
Tony Smith, a duo which
proved a formidable platoon
this season, will be back to
patrol the nets. The defense and
midfield will also return strong
units. Next year’s player-coach,
junior Bob Bowden, expects a
good, hard-hitting team to play
the fastest game on foot for
Davidson next year.
