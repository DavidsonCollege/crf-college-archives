DIRECTED AGAINST JONES

Mob Protests Faculty

By ED MAXWELL

Davidsonian Staff Writer

More than half of the stu-
dent botly staged a noisy, hour-
long demonstration Wednesday
night in protest of the faculty's
action on the fraternity ques-
tion.

Demonstrators began to gath.
er beneath the flagpole narth of
Chambers at 9:30 to set up a
gallows and prepare a bonfire.

Fifteen minutes later the bon-
fire was lit and demonstrators
cried ‘Jones must go!” refer-
ring to assistant Dean of Stu-
dents Bob Jones.

Karl Beck, spokesman for the
group, sald that the demonstra-
tion was not against Jones en-
tirely, but that “his vindictive-
ness lead him to be the focal
point of the demonstration.”

Students waved signs as the
frenzy of the mob _ increased.
“A college, a cloister, or a
kindergarten?"’ read one sign.
Another sald, ‘Without our frat-
ties all we can do is drink at

Hatties.”
‘Eaplier in the evening John

Barrow and Student Body Presi-
dent Bill Council went to the

second floor of Watts where
the demonstration reportedly
originated to request that the
organizers avold making a per-
sonal attack on Jones.

Bob Dugger, one of the plan- -

ners, insisted that the demon-
stration was in protest of “the
‘lack of directedness" of the fac-
ulty’s action.

Beck spoke to the group-es-
timated at 4800 at one time—
as they stood dround the fire
waving banners and shouting
“Keep our fraternities.”

He sald that'Dr. W. G. Me-
Gavock had offered a ‘“‘ration-
al and sincere proposal” which
was much better than that ac-
cepted by the faculty. ‘The fac-
ulty could reverse this decision
that has been made,” he said.

“One man with a vindictive
attitude can’t come here and
change something so basic in
one year,” continued Beck, who
later said he was referring to
Jones. Beck, the central or-
ganizer for the protest, is’ a
transfer student now in his first
year at Davidson.

From the bonfire the demon-
strators proceeded to march
with torches past the library
chanting,

of the crowd, said, “I’m the

Solution

Through Cooperation

By JOHN
Davidsonian

BAILEY
Staff Writer

Dr. W. G. McGavock, chairman of the faculty Com-
mittee on Fraternities, Clubs and Social Life, said in an
interview with THE DAVIDSONIAN this week that he
felt the recommendations adopted by the faculty were
compatible with his committee's report and that a satis-

factory solution would be reached

ing together.”

Seven of the nine proposals
of the daculty committee were
accepted.

McGavock said he was hope-
ful that the action taken by the
faculty would be “an active

Chambers where President Mar-
tin would speak to them.

President Martin appeared on
the steps of Chambers before
the mob and said, “I haven't
heard anything but noise which
you've made very adequately.
I don’t know what you expect
us to do.”

Beck again explained that the
protest was directed at what
wes considered to be unsatis-
factory faculty action. He
again said that he preferred
McGavoek's proposal.

Martin said that he felt that
the method the students were
using was altoget'yer improper.
“? don't think we've disregard-
e¢ your opinions” he said re-
flecting upon the faculty action.
“The matter is not yet settled,"
he added.

“Davidson College won't be
forced by action like this to do

anything.” stated Martin. “Sign *

petitions stating just what
you've been trying to put
across tonight.”

Martin then explained that he
was in the process of ptepar-
Ning the college budget for the
coming year and that he need-
ed to return to his work.

The demonstration
dissolved when Beck suggested
that the students return to their
rooms.

Julian Fite and Dugger, hav-
ing been among the organi-
zers, expressed their satisfac-
tion with the demonstration.

| Seniors Discontinue
Boycott Of Services

va

Senior fraternity men who
called for a boycott of required
chapel and vespers services for

| the remainder of the academic
year have since urged a dis-
continuance of the plan.

Only seniors were asked to
sign petitions which were cir-

~" | culated before Thursday chapel

calling for a boycott of re
quired services-for the renraind-
er of the yeat:-k was the inten-
‘tion of the group, according to
one spokesman, to walk out of
the chapel program Thursday.

Parry Teague, a senior mem-
ber of Sigma Chi, was sched-
uled to speak at the Thurs-
day program. Hearing of the
planned walkout, Chaplain Wil)
Terry persuaded Teague to post-
pone his talk and let Terry

. speak instead.

The chaplain walked off the

stage in the midst of his talk

“Ss after speaking for approximate-

ly seven minutes. Professor
James G. Martin, who was on
stage with Terry, then appeal-

other course of protest against

“A Vindictive Attitude”

The professor advised the stu-
dents that their proposed boy-
cott of required services would

not be focusing on the real is-
sue. He told the group to pe-
tition the trustees instead.

Several of Martin's colleagues

expressed disapproval of the
professor's urging student ac-
tion against the faculty deci-
sion.
Dick Bates, a senior mem-
ber of Kappa Alpha, followed
Martin to the rostrum and read
the petition which has been cir-
culated among the seniors.

The signees had stated their
willingness to risk any penalty
that might have been imposed
on them for the boycott.

In a statement t© THE DA-
VADGONIAN after the assem:
bly program, Ed Haselden ex-
plained the change in attitude
in the following way: ‘After
much thought and deliberation,
it has come to light that this
may not be the most feasible
means of bringing the matter
before the trustees.

“It was found that other defi-
nite and progressive steps were
underway to bring the faculty
committee report before the
trustees. We feel that continu-
ance of our boycott will serve
to confuse that matter more be-

are going’’ in trying to improve
the social life of Davidson stu-
dents.

McGavock pointed out that
the only possible imconsistency
between the faculty’s action
and the committee's report
would be in interpretation of
the basic philosophies of the
two.

“It was the idea of the com-
mittee not to institute an im-
mediate drastic change until
the college could be more assur-
ed of the outcome,”’ McGavock
said. As long as the faculty ac-
tion remains compatible with
this goal, he added, there should
be no barriers betweeh the two.

‘After extensive study the Fa-
culty Committee arrived at four
bases, according to McGavock,
upon which they were to deve-
lop their report: 1) there was
evidence that a change was
needed, 2) at present, frater-
nities held an undue share of
responsibility for social life on
campus. ;

3) There was a_ disposition
among fraternity leaders to im-
prove the situation, 4) because
of the lateness in the academic
year drastic change was not

PRES. D. G. MARTIN

No member of the class of
1869 will be allowed to pledge
a Greek letter social fraternity
during the academic year 1965-
1966, the faculty decided in its
meeting Tuesday.

The decision reached con-
cerning pledging is effective
only for the coming year, and
is one of nine recommenda-
tions approved by the faculty
in a three-hour session on the
fraternity problem. The pro-
fessors rejected the report of
the Faculty Committee on Fra-

Council Advises
Use Of ‘Reason’

Student Body President Bill
Council submitted the folowing
statement to THE DAVIDSON-
IAN Thursday night: .

“The course of action that
some of the students have taken
thus far concerning the fra-
ternity issue seems to indicate
that they haven't yet realized
that the best approach to our
problems lies in assuming as
reasonable an attitude as pos-
sible, and not in simply mak-
ing loud noises.

“Personally, I feel that a
demonstration such as the one
Wednesday night, regardless of
how orderly or well-conducted it
may be, can de -of no benefit
to any cause the students sup-
port. Thus far there seems to
have been a very distressing
lack of good sense shown on

the part of students.
owbs bie: J

“The sooner we free our-
selves from the seeming com-
pulsion of responding in the
typical Davidson manner by
simply ridiculing an idea or a
person, and attempt to take a
reasonable approach to our
problems, the faster we will
move toward a solution.

“On the behalf of the Student
Council, I urge all students
voicing concern on this issue to
let their good sense rule their
emotions in presenting their
viewpoints.

“Tt should be obvious from
the statement of President Mar-
tin and others that the Faculty
and Trustees continue to de
receptive tw any fteasonable,
constructive ideas that the stu-
dents might voice. This issue
is very far from a final solu-
tion.”

men). It is to be appointed by the President of the College.

(b) Regular meetings, perhaps monthly, should be scheduled.

(c) Recommendations should be made to the Faculty whenever the
group sees fit to do so.

dation to the Faculty by the February meeting of 1966 with regard to
the wisdom of Sophomore Rush in 1966-67.

(e) The Committee is asked to state as early as possible what roles are

‘Martin Says Trustees
May Have Final Word

ternities, Clubs, and Social Life
in the principal area of rush
procedure for the coming year.

The faculty committee, under
the chairmanship of Dr. W. G.
McGavock, had proposed a de-
layed rush program in which
rush would not begin until Nov-
ember 1. Bidding and accept-
ance of bids were to take place
during the Christmas holidays.
There was to be no formal
pledging until after the end of
the first semester.

The essence of the proposal
was to decrease the pressure
upon incoming students while
allowing the maintenance of the
Present system, according to
the committee report.

President D. Grier Martin
pointed out during a special
chapel Wednesday moraing for
the explanation of the faculty’s
action that the final decision
remained in the hands of the
Board of Trustees when it meets
during April.

Martin strongly emphasized
the additional expenditures that
would be incurred in the plan
adopted by the faculty. Includ-
ed among these is the construc-
tion of two new houses to serve
as eating clubs which would
have no restriction upon mem-
bership. The immediate cost
of effecting the action is esti-.
mated to be $100,000.

It was further emphasized by
Martin that since the funds -had
to come from somewhere.
there would have to be econo-
mizing in all areas with poss-
ible ‘‘adverse effects upon in-
creases in professors’ salaries.”’
He also pointed out certain
other facets of academic life
such as the library that may
be affected.

The entire plan of the faculty
is contained in nine proposals.
The object of the action taken
is ¢o try to allow for more thor-
ough evaluation of the situation
after measures less expensive
than those of the original Fra-
ternity Evaluation Cammittee
have been tried, according to
McGavock,

The ‘faculty's action included
two of the nine immediate pro-
posals. of the Fraternity Evalu-
ation Committee (no freshman
pledging during the academic
year 1965-66 and members of the

> class of 1969 eating in the Col-

lege Union during the entire
freshman year). .

Seven of the nine proposals
of the Faculty Committee on
Fraternities, Clubs and Social
Life were accepted by the fa-
culty. The report abolished
summer rush, effective im-
mediately, and it instituted an
expanded intramural program
to include all groups of students.

The faculty also directed each

cluding fraternities —- to give
“official satisfaction" to the
college that all students of
Davidson are eligible for mem-
bership. This is to be done by
September 1, 1966, or the groups
will be removed from the
campus.

It was provided that a Social
Life Evaluating Committee be
established to make an apprai-
sal of the recommended chan-
ges. The committee, to be ap-
pointed by the college, is to sub-
mit a report to the faculty by
the February meeting of 1966 on
the ‘wisdom’ of sophomore
tush in 1966-67.

There will also be a Social
Council to aid in planning all
phases of social life. The Stu-
dent Council will organize this

‘group and select the members.

The final proposal adopted
during the faculty meeting was
the provision for allowing fresh-

men to have cars on campus.

From all indications there is
little reason to believe that
there will be further faculty
action at least unti] after the
trustees meet, according to
President Martin.
