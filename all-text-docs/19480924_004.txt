IN THE U.S. AIR FORCE?

The ceiling’s unlimited! Men who enter the
Air Force as Aviation Cadets become 2nd
Lieutenants within a year. From there on, they
can climb as far and as fast as their ability and
the needs of the service permit. Under the Air
Force expansion program, there is plenty of
room for advancement. 2nd Lieutenants auto-
matically become 1st Lieutenants after three
years of service; are eligible to become Cap-
tains, Majors.and Lieutenant-Colonels after 7,
14 and 21 years respectively. More rapid pro-
motions are frequent. Never before has the
opportunity for making the Air Force a perma-
nent career been so favorable, especially to
the men in Aviation Cadet Pilot Training.

Here are the requirements:

Appointment to the Aviation Cadets is open to single men, between
20 and 26% years old, who have completed two years of college
(or can pass an equivalent examination). Upon graduation, Cadets
receive their wings and commission, a $250 uniform allowance,
ahd three-year active duty assignment with pay up to $336 a
month. Get full details at any Air Force Base or at any U. S, Army
and U. S. Air Force Recruiting Station.
