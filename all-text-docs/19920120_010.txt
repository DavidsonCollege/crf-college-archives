Achtung,
Baby!

to time, exist purely for enjoy-
ment. And Bono doesn’t have to
save the world, but he can just sing
about his own personal concems.

Indeed, themes regarding per-
sonal relationships dominate the
lyrics of Achtung Baby. One tell-
ing line comes on the song “Trying
to Throw Your Arms Around the
World”. Bono sings, “A woman
needs a man like a fish needs a
bicycle / When you’re trying to
throw yourarmsaround the world.”
This borrowed line hints that he
feels some regret at the way the
band has lived the last ten years.
Perhapsareturn to real life, to their
lives, is the best way to live, be-
cause itis impossible save the world
and engage in successful relation-
ships with the people around you.
The whole album reflects this atti-
tude.

Achtung Baby conspicuously
lacks crusades, as the band is con-
cerned more with themselves than
with world around them. “One”
takes a hard look at a relationship
that has failed, as Bono tries to
understand all of the problems and
negative emotions. As usual, the
feeling with which he sings takes it

beyond its limits, and the music
itself is enjoyable. A muted guitar
gently progresses, carrying the
listener’s ear with it.

But gentle guitars do not mark
this album. Instead, U2 employs a
funkier sound, as on the current hit
song “Mysterious Ways.” Mostof
the stuff is really danceable, with
bass and drums prominent. The
crunchy guitar sound that marks
The Unforgettable Fire is there,
but it is backed up by a bouncier
percussion section. Just as they
have realigned their lyrics, so has
U2 slightly changed their music.
While the sound seems a little
obscure, it quickly proves itself
quality pop material.

Pop material is not always
good, though, and Achtung Baby
does have its failures. As they have
been overzealous with their world-
saving songs in the past, they occa-
sionally go a little too far with their
songs of personal redemption here.
The worst example is “Who’s
Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses”, a
melodramatic teeny-bopper ballad
which would have fit perfectly on
the Breakfast Club soundtrack.

Other than the occasional
melodrama, though, Achtung Baby
succeeds. Buy it, and you’ll see
that U2 is not the same band that
was always trying to tell us what to
do three years ago.

tinct that the film maintains abso-
lute clarity. Stone’s use of sound
effects to amplify the characters’
mental condition is reminiscent of
Francis Ford Coppolla’s very best
work.

The problems with J. F. K. are
far less subtle than the film’s high
points. As in Platoon, Talk Radio,
and Born of the Fourth of July,
Stone moralizes and propagandizes
relentlessly, His script portrays
Garrison as an unsung hero-god
whose reputation has been tar-
nished by “the establishment” for
challenging the findings of the
Warren Commission.

With all the subtlety of a
sledgehammer, Stone has Costner
stand before both the Lincoln
Memorial and the Eternal Flame
as the last remaining American
with a conscience. Costner’s tear
besmirched closing argument
about Kennedy’s position as
America’s last hope evokes laugh-
ter from the more cynical mem-
bers of the audience.

Casting aside Stone’s plainly
annoying grandstanding,J.F.K.is
a fascinating study in the theories
surrounding Kennedy’ sassassina-
tion, and makes for a fantastically
exciting movie.

affair with a rather pathetic Mary-Louise Parker. As his friendship with
Glover grows and they become more involved in each other’s lives,
Steve Martin’s character, that of an obscenely wealthy crap film pro-
ducer, rises and falls according to the emotional swings from anear-fatal
mugging.

He stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the main characters by the
end of the film as the epiphany he experiences immediately after his
recovery in the hospital wears off when he gets back to his not-so socially
redeeming work.

The final shot of the Grand Canyon itself, the symbol of everything
that transcends bullets and movies and abandoned babies, is effective
even if undeveloped. One can see the Kasdans becoming more and more
despondent about society’s increasingly self-destructive tendencies and
then taking a trip out to the biggest whole in the Earth and saying,
“Wow...maybe it’s not so bad.”

Granted, thinking in terms of geological time doesn’t seem so
comforting when your house is being artificially ventilated with machine
gun fire but looking at the larger scheme of things cannot always hurt.

All of the actors pull off their roles. In addition to those I’ve already
mentioned, Mary McDonnell plays Kline’s wonderfully compassionate
and life-cherishing wife. Alfre Woodward, too, is effectual in a smaller
role as Glover’s new girlfriend. Even McDonnell’s fifteen-year-old son
Roberto comes off as being “much less of a punk than most kids are at
that age,” said alumnus Bryan Kirtley ’90.

Those whoare looking for the Big Chill of the Nineties, as this movie
has been billed, will be disappointed. Grand Canyon is not cute and
doesn’t pretend to be. Itis a stark look at a suicidal American culture that
does not proffer a prescription for our ills but at least points toward
reasons for not blowing ourselves up.

Do yourself a favor and see this film.
