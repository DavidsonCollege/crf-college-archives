The task of finding a new president
was formidable. Twenty trustees,
five students, five faculty, and three
administrators worked 18 months to
find the right person.

“One of the amazing things about
the Search Committee given how
diverse it was, given the many con-
stituencies of the College and the
strength of personalities repre-
sented, was that there was absolute
enthusiasm for Bobby Vagt,” said
Math Professor and member of the
Presidential Search Committee Ben
Klein.

The committee voted unanimously
to approve Vagt.

The Vagt women, Ruth Anne,

Ashley, and Lindsey, were play-
ing with Ashley’s large puppy as
I approached. They had rented a
minivan and Ashley and Lindsey
were getting ready to go to Baskin
Robbins for ice cream.
No one looked like she was go-
ing to move from Houston to
Davidson by July 1 to start a new
life in what Ashley calls “the bird-
cage,” or the President’s house.
Yet, Ruth Anne was ready for the
change.

nitely stay in Texas for Lindsey

be pleasant to be back to the East

MEET THE PRESIDENT

“* Diverse committee makes unanimous decision

“For me, as a member of the Presi-
dential Search Committee, I wanted
to find somebody who I was sure
was going to ensure that teaching
and learning are the absolute core
of what we do at Davidson,” said
French Professor Homer Sutton
who was also a member of the
Search Committee. “Someone
whose leadership, vision, compas-
sion, spirituality, and spirit of ser-
vice would allow us to continue our
tradition in the areas of service and
compassion. I think I was also
looking for someone who had a
good sense of humor, someone who

‘loved Davidson.”

During Vagt’s weekend visit, Chair-
man of the Presidential Search
Committee Larry Dagenhart said,
_“ Wee
wanted a
president
who could
do the job
and be the
job.”
“The
being part
of the job
was some-
thing we
were not
going to
compro-
mise. We
wanted top-
of-the-line
character
and integ-
rity, a presi-
dent who

De fps of the Wy

Coast after that,” she says. “This
[the position for President opening
and Lindsey graduating from high
school} is an amazing coincidence
of time and we are very fortunate.
It will be very different from our
Houston life, but very welcomed.”

Ruth Anne started her own
story slowly, “I graduated from
Queens College in ‘69. I majored
in economics, but I really have
never used that degree,” she says
laughingly. “I was born in Ala-
bama, lived 'in the same home town
until I went to Queens, and then I
never went back.”

She was married in December
of her senior year in college and
lived in a renovated dentist’s office
above a bank on Main Street in
Davidson. From then on, she ac-
companied her husband in
his rising professional ca-
Teer.

Stopping her narrative, she
asked Lindsey about her
plans to get back to the air-
port.

Ruth Anne’s youngest
daughter applied early ad-
mission to come to
Davidson. At that time no
one speculated that her fa-
ther would be the next presi-
dent,

“This [the Vagt’s new role
forming during their
daughter’s freshman year] is
going to be so hard on
Lindsey. I want her to have
her own college experienee

was committed
body and soul
to perpetuating
and invproving
what the Col-
lege is and what
it stands for,”
said Klein.

In evaluating
the “doing” re-
quirements for
the position,
Klein and the
rest of the com-
mittee looked at
a variety of
skills such as
fundraising,
management,
acquaintance of
trends in educa-
tion, knowl-
edge of what is
happening in
the Presbyterian Church (USA),
and other issues.

“No one person was going to sat-
isfy every single one of these crite-
ria, so we were willing to compro-
mise on some of these,” said Klein.
“We realized that this was sort of
an idealized check list and there
wasn’t any candidate who satisfied
every single criteria.”

Vagt’s eclectic positions in the pri-
vate and public sectors and his reli-
gious background combined to
make him the most outstanding can-
didate. Not that there were not res-
ervations about his lack of experi-.
ence with higher education: “Al-
though he is coming from outside

to live in ‘the birdcage’

The Vagts are ready to begin life in Davidson

which she wants to have too. That
will be easier said than done,
though,” Ruth Anne says.

The role of the President’s spouse
is not clearly defined. Ruth Anne
intends “to support whatever the
college is involved with at the time.
I certainly hope to have an idea of
my own and a life of my own on

the academy without a Ph.D., he has
such appreciation for Davidson’s
heritage, for teaching, and learning
that he will devote his energies to
ensuring that liberal arts education
remains absolutely the primary
function of this college,” said
Sutton.*

Klein warns that the hardest part of
the job is still ahead. “A lot of
people have been coming up to me
to congratulate me on all of the
work .we [the Presidential Search
Committee] did,” he said. “I want

people to come up to me two years

the side. I think Missy
[Kuykendall] has done that very
well.”

Missy’s advice to Ruth Anne was
“to really ease into it and see
what is best for me. There’s no
pressure to be overcommitted
right away.”
