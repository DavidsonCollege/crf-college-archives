In League B the Delts lead at

ot 40 Ancther pair of unbeaten
tcams. Emanon 5-0 and Por-
fer‘s 4:0. are atop League C.

Emanon ITI defeaied the Nus

Rifle Team Tackles
Presbyterian Today

Desp:te Max  Thomasson's
ma’ch:leading 259. the Davidson
tifle tearm dropped their third
straight match last week to the
Richmond gunners by a slim 12
po.ut’ margin.

The team will, participate in
(wo matches this weekend, tac-
kling Presbyterian today and
Clemson tomorrow.

Coach Richard Carmody was

hopeful for the PC match, but-

dubious of the ‘Cats chances
against the Tigers.

“Clemson has a real strong
program.” he said, ‘they're on
a level with The Citadel.”

Carmody said that the team’s
chances were greatly improved
by the return of Larry Crowell,
a regular from last year who
was, unable to work with the
tcam in the. fall.

The team also has three fresh-
men, Jim Fagan, Gary Frank,
and Henry Barber, who Car-
Inody said should “help form a
nucleus .for next year.”

The Fs opened with a big
win over Delt U1 3t40 behind a
balanced attack.

Eldin Basham and John We
bel had 20 and 18 poms, re-
spectively, in a 99-32 romp over
the Plumbers. and teamed for
33 more to lead a 67:38 triumph
over the Nus.

F&M handed the E's their
only setback 51-40 despite Butch
Baird's 18 markers. Tony Mar-
un's 17 was tops for the win-
ners.

In League B. the Delts. be
hind Greg and Mike Sikes. have
reeled off wins over Cannon |(
34-444. Sentelle 1 79-68, the Betas
39-46, the KAs 85-49 and crushed
PAX Wednesday for their fifth
straight.

Gieg Sikes canned 18 agains:
Cannon I. and tossed in 24
while Mike hit for 16 to offset
a 32-point barrage by the los-
ers’ Bill Mckirnon.

Greg fired in 23 more in a
big win over the Betas. whose
Randy Ely hit for 17. Agains:
the KAs he pumped in 29 and
Mike collected 16.

Keeter's has not been press-
ed yet. Behind 35 points by
Steve Williams, they buried Sen-
telle 1 92-32. Williams had 78
more as they drubbed Emanon
Wt 79-32.

Mike’ O'Malley and Gary Sci-
bal combined for 46 points to
blast the KAs 63-31, and O’Mal-
ley hit for 20 as they ran past
Big E 61-32.

Porter’s, like Keeter’s. has
not yet met its first test. Frank
Clark totalled 57 points in wins
over Watts | 68-44 and Beta il
80-53, and headed a balanced
attack against the Gamms (60-
47) and Pax I (78-28).

Emancn edged the SPEs Wed.
nesday to remain unbeaten. The
shooting of Frank Folger and
Sam Upchurch paced wins over
Pax Ii 110-17, Gamms 90-61, Can-
non II 105.47, and a big win over
the previously-unbeatcn Taus

79-68.
