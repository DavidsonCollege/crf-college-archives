How GM is responding

to the

Over a year ago, we asked our
plant engineers to establish an energy
conservation program to cut waste,
improve utilization and generally
increase the effective use of our
energy resources.

In our plants we're instituting
programs to salvage oil and other
combustible materials that were
once thought to be waste materials
of the manufacturing process. Then
we're using those former waste mate-
nalstofireboilers in some plants and
in others we're cleaning the oil and
selling it to local power generating
stations. It’s a method that has been
tried and tested. It works. It’s even
economical.

Asystem developed by General
Motors engineers for “scrubbing” the
sulfur dioxide out of coal smoke is
moving at an accelerated pace. As
the technology is proved out, we're
making it available to anyone who
can use it. There are large deposits
of coal in the United States that will
become immediate substitutes for oil
when we can make sulfur-bearing
coal an environmentally acceptable
fuel.

We are working toward improv-
ing the gas mileage in the cars we
design and build. Wind tunnel experi-
ments, weight reduction programs
and major programs for the develop-
ment of more efficient engines are
all being pushed ahead.

And weare preparing ourselves
to satisfy any increased future con-
sumer demand for smaller, more
energy-efficient engines and cars.

Properly utilized, mass transpor-
tation systems are also highly effi-
cient users of energy. GM is engaged
in major research and product devel-
opment programs to improve bus
transportation, the most flexible,
easiest and quickest to implement of

energy problem.

mass transportation systems. Those
programs include the design of buses,
new methods for the efficient opera-
tion of buseson reserved or exclusive
lanes into and through downtown
areas or central business districts,
and the automated control of rubber-
tired transit vehicles on special
guideways. Long range plans for
mass transportation developed by
GM were displayed in Washington
at Transpo 72.

In addition to building standard
rail commuter diesel electromotives,
we have initiated efforts to produce
locomotives powered only by elec-
tricity. GM, over many years, has
done creative research which
has been utilized by government
agencies and transit operators in
improving public transit. As urban
transportation systems are designed
and approved by the various levels
of government, GM will be ready to
build the hardware.

Energy can also be conserved
by the more efficient use of the cars
and trucks now on the road. It is in
everyone's interest to get maximum
gas mileage by maintaining cars and
trucks in good order, avoiding exces-
sive speeds and quick starts, and by
sharing the nde whenever conve-
nient and practical. For instance, driv-
ing at 50 mph rather than at 70 mph
could increase gas mileage by about
20%. We are taking steps to remind
our customers of these good driving
practices.

GM is determined to do its full
share in the resolution of the energy
problem.

We also pledge our complete
support for all reasonable govern-
ment efforts to increase available
energy and maintain maximum con-
sumer choice.
