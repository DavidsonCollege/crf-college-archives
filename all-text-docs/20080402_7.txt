Kansas edges Davidson in regional final
Kansas 59, Davidson 57

By MIKE FRONGELLO

One way or another, history was going to
be made Sunday afternoon in Detroit as
10th-seeded Davidson took on Kansas in
the Midwest Regional Final. No 10-seed
have ever advanced to the Final Four, and
never had all four No. 1-seeds made it to
the final weekend either. With 16 seconds
remaining that historic Final Four trip to
San Antonio was on the line.

Kansas led 59-57, but Davidson, making
its first appearance in a regional final since
1969, had the ball in the hands of the tour-
nament’s hottest player and leading scorer
Stephen Curry *10. Curry had totaled 103
points in the first three rounds in leading
the I’Cats to victories over nationally-
ranked Gonzaga, Georgetown and
Wisconsin.

The sophomore guard dribbled the ball
up the court, hoping to add one more mem-
orable moment to the Wildcats’ already
magical season, but he was unable to
escape the Kansas defensive pressure and
found himself double-teamed 20 feet from
the basketball as the final seconds ticked
off the clock. He managed to find back-

court mate Jason Richards ’08 open a cou-
ple feet behind the three-point line, but
Richards desperation 25-foot heave was off
the mark as the Jayhawks secured the nar-
row 59-57 victory.

Richards fell to his needs as the ball
bounced off the backboard and Curry stood
dejected, hunched over with his hands on
his knees. Kansas players celebrated as
Davidson’s dream season and 25-game win-
ning streak came to an end, but the Wildcats
had little to be disappointed about.

They proved to the nation that their 29-7
record was no fluke with their Elite 8 tour-
nament run and they proved they were
every bit as good as No. | seed Kansas in
the close defeat. The two teams fought
evenly in the first half as both team were
unable to sustain leads longer than four in
the opening period.

Curry led all scorers with 15 points in the
first half, but Darnell Jackson’s lay-up with
five seconds left gave the Jayhawks the 30-
28 halftime advantage. Neither team was
able to create any distance on the score-
board early in the second half, but Kansas
opened up a 43-37 lead on Brandon Rush’s
conventional three-point play with 12 min-

Bryant Barr ’10 gave the Cats a boost off
the bench with 11 points, including back-to-
back three-pointers that brought Davidson to
within one point of the Jayhawks at 45-44.
Andrew Lovedale "09 scored a lay-up on the
Wildcats’ next possession and Barr followed
with that up with another three to give the
Cats a 49-45 lead with under 10 minutes to
play.

Davidson would maintain a slim lead for a
couple of minutes, but Sherron Collins ignit-
ed a Kansas run with a three-pointer at the
6:29 mark to return the lead to the Jayhawks
52-51. The “Cardiac Cats” and Curry had
come up with late big game plays through-
out tournament, but the Kansas defense
appeared to have the Wildcat offensive
attack contained as they extended their lead
to 59-53 with just over a minute to play.

It appeared the Davidson comeback magic
had run out until Thomas Sander ’08 was
fouled with just under a minute to go. The
senior forward, playing with a broken thumb
suffered in the Gonzaga game, made the first
free throw, but the second shot bounced off
the back rim. Max Paulhus Gosselin ’09 bat-
tled with Rush for the rebound and the ball
went out of bounds off Kansas giving the
Wildcats the ball and new life.

On the ensuing inbounds play Richards
found Curry, who finished the game with 25
points, on the left wing and Curry drained
the long three-pointer to bring the "Cats to
within 59-57 with 55 seconds remaining tn

Baseball slides against SoCon competition

By Patrick MCARDLE
Sports Editor

The baseball team faltered as it began SoCon play, losing
its series against the Socon’s preseason number-one pick
College of Charleston, a single game against the out-of-con-
ference North Carolina Tar Heels, and its series against
Wofford. The Wildcats record now sits at 8-14.

The series against College of Charleston did not go well for

the ’Cats, with three losses against the powerhouse Cougars.
In the first game of the series, the Cougars amassed 24 hits to
score a program-high 3] runs to beat the Wildcats 31-3. Third
baseman Jeremie Tice led the Cougar offense by going a per-
fect 4-for-4 from the plate with five runs scored and seven
RBI, including a fourth inning grand-slam. Jay Honeycutt ’10
led the ’Cats by going 1-3 from the plate with two RBIs.
’ The second game against Charleston proved a bit more
competitive for the Wildcats. Davidson scored three runs in
the bottom of the sixth to cut the margin to 7-4, but
Charleston answered with six runs in the last two innings to
prevent the comeback and win 13-4. Chase Fitzpatrick ’09
went 2-4 with a homerun from the cleanup spot, while Danny
Weiss ’11 also went 2-4.

The series finale against Charleston proved to be the clos-
est with the Wildcats finding themselves just two runs short,
6-8. Tied at 6 entering the ninth inning thanks to two-out RBI
singles from Pat Brady ’09 and Hugh Eden ’08, the Wildcats
could not prevent two runs in the top of the inning, as the
Cougars secured the SoCon sweep with an 8-6 win on Easter

Sunday. Ian Horkley ’11 suffered the loss to drop to 0-3 on
the season, surrendering three runs on four hits over 1 1/3
innings of relief.

The Wildcats then travelled away from Wilson Field to
play the Tar Heels, but the team again fell to the opposition,
this time by the score of 6-12. The Tar Heels jumped out to
an early lead, as Chad Flack sent in a pair of runs with his
first double of the day. North Carolina added five runs in the
second inning and a pair in the third to take a commanding
9-0 lead from which the Wildcats could never recover. Chase
Fitzpatrick again led the ’Cats’ offensive attack with two sin-
gles and an RBI.

The team returned home to play Wofford. In the first game
of the series, the Wildcats let a 5-4 game spiral out of con-
trol by giving up seven runs in the late innings to lose 13-4.
Zach Kayne ’09 led the offense with two hits, one of which
left the park for his first homerun of the year.

Davidson broke its losing streak on Saturday, beating
Wofford 6-5 in dramatic fashion. The ‘Cats jumped out to an
early 2-0 lead after getting a run in each of the first two
frames, but fell behind 5-3 entering the bottom of the eighth.
Left fielder Chase Fitzpatrick started the eighth with a single
to center field and designated hitter Weiss picked up a walk
to put two aboard. Honeycutt’s sac bunt advanced both run-
ners, and catcher Tommy Piacenza ’10 delivered a triple into
the gap in left field to plate both and tie the score at 5-all.

After Mike Frongello ’11 shut down the Wofford side in
the top of the ninth, Eden delivered with a walk-off shot to
end the game. The homerun was Eden’s second of the sea-

Unfortunately, the Wildcats could not clinch the series on
Sunday, giving up a late lead to lose 6-4. Leading 4-2 in the
top of the ninth, Frongello could not hold off the Terriers
who came through with a two-run single to knot up the
score. Despite loading the bases in the bottom of the inning,
the Wildcats could not push across a run. In extra innings,
the Terriers tacked on two runs that the Wildcats could not
answer in the bottom of the frame.
