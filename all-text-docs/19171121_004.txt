CHRISTMAS NIGHT
IN THE QUARTERS

Dr. #ulton’s recent contribution to
American Literature, ‘Christmas Night
in the Quarters,” gets its title from a
poem which the volume contains. This
is a collection of forty poems by Irvin
Russell. Five poems of this collection
have only appeared in newspapers when
they were written, hence unknown to lit-
erature; and three have never before
heen published. “Fhe volume is prefaced
by an introducttion by Joel Chandler
Harris. ‘There are dispersed thruout the
pages twenty-nine pen and pencil
sketches by FE. W. Kemble.

The most unique feature of the book
is a biegraphical sketch by Dr. Fulton,
who, being a Mississippian. is not inter-
ested in the noet of negro dialect because
of his being from Mississippi, but rather
hecanse “his poems possess the vitality of
genius.”

Had the life of this poet of promise
been lengthened his recent editor says
that “he might have made a deeper mark
on American literature, tho he could not
have made a more original impress than
he had already done thru the deep poetic
vision that saw pathos and humor and

Dr. Fulton's sketch is marked by his
fine scholarship and his research into the
facts of his life. “To best know and ap-
preciate the works of a man it is neces-
sary to know the formative influence and
some of the leading facts of the life. In
this book, as in his courses, he makes
the sketch interesting and not burdened
with details. It is comprehensive in that
it gives just what vou should know—
the remainder is happily unsaid.

Many men of literary genius have piti-
fully had lives which were marred by
sin and weaknesses. Russell was not im-
mune. Dr. Fulton is sympathetic and
gives a psychological analysis of his de-
fects in that of “his realization of the
losing struggle between his higher nature
with its many attractive and lovable
qualities and his lower nature which par-
ticularly manifested itself in a craving
for stimulants.”

The negro of whom we learned on our
grandmother’s knee is almost extinct.
There will never be such a’ devoted and
lovable set of negroes as those who loved
our grandparents as thev loved their own
children. They must nor be forgotten.
The old-time darkey will long be re-
membered thru the thumb nail character
sketches in Russell’s poems. The treat-
ment of this black creature is not to “en-
hance old Southern life.” but rather to
present his character, which presentation
