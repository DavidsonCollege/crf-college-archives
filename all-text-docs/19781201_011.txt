‘Despite the loss of last year’s” a

talented workhorse, Jonathan
Washburn, the 1978-79 edition
of the Davidson swimming
team could be the strongest in
school history. The squad re-
corded a fourth place finish in
the Southern Conference meet

class coupled with a strong
group of returning upperclass-
men may allow the Wildcats to
improve upon that finish.

will be junior Mark Tommer-
dahl, who primarily swims the
butterfly. Tommerdahl also will
be counted upon for some
freestyle and individual medly
work.. - :

Senior John Frederick, jun-
iors Steve Yood and Steve
Risley, and sophomores Ed
Imbrogno, Ed Trumbull and
Ray Craven, will provide depth
in the freestyle events.

Other upperclassmen in the
stroke events include junior
Tom Spangler, sophomore
Ralph Mosca, and’ senior Skip
Barkley in the backstroke. Al-

‘ong. with junior Kirk Williams.

in the butterfly, sophomore
Pete Neefus will compete in
diving.

Eleven freshmen are listed on
the team’s 23-man roster. These
newcomers will help compen-
sate for the loss of Washburn.

and Rick Williams.

‘Coach Pat Miller looks for an —

‘exciting season due to an
extremely tough schedule.”

“We think this is going to be
a good season. We've got a lot
of talented people back. In the
past-we usually have relied on
one or two good swimmers. This
time it’s more spread out,”
Miller added.

Madison, The Citadel, Wil-

liam and Mary, and Appala-
chian State highlight the stiff

schedule for the team. The —
