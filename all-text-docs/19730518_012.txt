Outlining some of the reasons
that the fund will probably not
reach its goal by the scheduled
close in June, Winston said,
‘The church sessions only meet
once a month and we had over
500 sessions to meet. We will
continue working during the
summer since the arrival of
many of our contributions will
spill over into the summer.

‘We will meet the goal, it’s
just a matter of announcing its
completion in the fall rather
than in June," Winston con-
cluded.

Winston said that he hoped
that the publicity about the
drive’s falling short of its
schedule would encourage
people to contribute.

Bevan commented on the
situation saying, ‘‘We would
hope that stories about David-
son in the press would be
productive to the institution as
well as to higher education. We
can do without this type of
publicity.

“This article, whether in-
tended or not intended, gave a
tongue-in-cheek impression of
fund raising and worse yet, fund
raising in higher education.”

Bevan said that he has been in
touch with President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. who is out of town
and has spoken to him about the
matter. President Spencer's
sentiments, said Bevan, were
that ‘‘We should not get all alar-
med over this matter until we
know its implications.

“We have been very for-
tunate,”’ said Bevan, ‘‘to have
Graeme Keith as chairman of
the fund drive. This drive is on
its way to being a success and
he has played no small part in
that success.

The Journal article noted that
Keith was sixth on the list of
people being considered for the
chairmanship at the beginning
of the drive.

“I think the drive has every
chance to succeed,’’ said
Allinger, ‘‘as it has always had
the potential to succeed.’

Bevan related that Spencer .

he picked up a copy of the Jour-

Interested in finding out what
the man’s secret was, Spencer

...11.PC Recommendations

(Continued From Page 1)
forms of compensation is to sup-
port faculty members in giving
time to research and to catch up
in the field, activities which
may have been neglected
because of time spent with Ex-
tended Studies.”

One member of the Extended
Studies Committee, Professor
of Philosophy John J. Young,
dissented from this recom-
mendation.

‘‘In order to reap the benefits
of ‘released time’ or increased
compensation,” he said, “a
faculty member would have to
supervise at least eight dif-
ferent projects (which could in-
volve more than eight students)
within five or six terms.

**He would then have to ‘catch
up’, as the Report itself ex-
plicitly states, in his or her
professional development.

“Any program which thus ex-

plicitly acknowledges that a

faculty member will fall behind

in his professional development
is clearly self-defeating.

“The quality of one’s teaching
certainly cannot improve from
One's falling behind in one’s
field; nor can one be expected
to publish if one is out of touch
with current developments in
one’s field.

‘In short, I still see the
program as unrealistic and un-
fair.”

EPC Chairman John M.
Bevan indicated that some
more work will be done on the
recommendation which con-
cerns faculty compensation.

The EPC will also look into
the relationship between fresh-
man/sophomore Extended
Studies and the junior/senior
program which is not dealt with
in the current proposals.

The final decision on the
recommendations will be made
by the faculty at their next
meeting.

Although the recom-
mendations seem to be an ap-
parent cutback in the program,
as the Extended Studies Report
itself acknowledges, according
to the committee this is not the
case.

“Closer examination of the
recommendations will reveal
that these suggestions are in-
tended to strengthen the Ex-
tended Studies Program, or at
least the best features of it,”’ the

report maintains.

‘We believe that independent
study at the appropriate level is
of great benefit to the student,"’
the report continues; ‘‘we know
that many students must be en-
couraged to undertake such
study, and we would urge ad-
visers to encourage their fresh-
men and sophomores to involve

themselves in the Extended
Studies program.

“We do not believe that the
reading programs, as now con-
stituted, contribute materially
either to the independence of
student's work or, for the most
part, to the addition of an in-
terdisciplinary component to
the curriculum.
