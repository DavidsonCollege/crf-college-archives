Could Iraq Be "Another Vietnam?"

By Ross Sloop

Are we in for another Viet-
vam?

This question seems to be on
2veryone’s mind. Many of the signs
posted on campus, both for and
against military involvement, make
references to Woodstock, the late
‘60s, and Vietnam. Nobody wants
the country to re-live the pain suf-
fered in Southeast Asia. But isn’t
that possible in the Middle East?

Professors Shi, Ortmayer,
Gibson, and Mahoney were all col-
lege students during the late ’60s
and early ’70s. They provided the
Davidsonian with their opinions
on the similarities and differences
between the two wars.

Dr. Gibson, Duke ’70, pointed
out the difference in the ways the
country entered war.

“Americans were slowly
nudged into consciousnessas mili-
lary involvementin Vietnam stead-
ily increased. In the Middle East
everyone was anxiously aware of
the approaching deadline.”

Many people agree with Dr.
Ortmayer, Yale ’67, that unlike in
S.E. Asia we are much more aware
of who the enemy is in Iraq.

“Although we might not have
any better understanding of why
we are fighting, we do have clearer
lines drawn as to who the threat is
in the Middle East.”

If we fought in Vietnam to stop
the spread of communism, and the
Iraqi War is a battle for oil then
both were economic wars, right?
Wrong, says Dr. Mahoney, Wil-
liams ’73.

“America’s fear of the Dom-
ino Theory (spread of communism
in S.E. Asia) was never justified in
Vietnam: The North Vietnamese
conquest of the south was a civil
war.”

He also claims that there is
litle reason to believe that Sad-
dam Hussein would attack other

countries.

“Saddam Hussein has always
felt that Kuwait was part of his
country’s territory because they
speak the same lamguage and share
the same customs.”

Dr. Shi, Furman 73, an expert
in Vietnamese history, sees more
differences than similarities be-
tween the two wars.

“The involvement of interna-
tional troops and the role of the
United Nations has kept the U.S.

from looking as much like an

imperialistic bully.”

Dr. Shi also sees the absence
of the draft as a big difference
between the two wars and a reason
for the current support of military
invovement in the Middle East.

“The draft was a major dy-
namic reason for the anti-war
movement of the ’60s.”

Despite all of the differences,
there are a number of similarities.

Mahoney and Shi both ex-
pressed fear concerning the ele-
ment of racism in the two wars.
Unlike America’s past European
wars, it’s easy when fighting
against people of different cultures
for racism to become a spring-
board for hatred. Whereas in Viet-
nam enemies were often called
“chinks and gooks” now the air is
filled with talk of “towel-heads”
and “camel jockeys”.

“Vietnam was a racist war,”
says Mahoney “and Iraq could
become the same.”

Dr. Gibson is going through
much of the same prsonal frustra-
tion that she did in the late ’60s.

“At Duke there was the fear
that my husband might be drafted.
Iremember when my son was born
in 1973, I was so relieved that he
wouldn’t have to suffer through
the Vietnam conflict. Now I am
again worried that while my son
turns 18, the country is entering
another war.”

None of the professors advo-
cate military involvement in the
Middle East right now. Dr. Ort-
mayer would like to have seen the
economic sanctions given more
time to work.

“Although military force may
get Iraq out of Kuwait, it won’t
solve any of the underlying prob-
lems.”

Dr. Mahoney. points to the

. success of economic sanctions in

South Africa as well as the success
of the embargoof Cubain the ’60s.
Could there possibly be any
positive results of a war? Profes-
sors see the increased awareness
of young people as a positive out-
come of both the Vietnamese con-
flict and the Iraqi War. War seems
to bring about a raised level of
consciousness that would be diffi-
cult to achieve otherwise. Each
professor supports demonstrating,
hanging signs, and holding vigils,
as they all supported the anti-war
movement of their day.

Dr. Gibson believes that stu-
dents sometimes protest wars for
selfish reasons.

“There is almostapsychic need
for demonstrating. Protest isaritu-
alistic action that students do more
for themselves.”

The question remains, are we
in for another Vietnam? Despite
the similarities and differences of
the circumstances leading to war,
people really want to know if this
war, like Vietnam, will drag out
for years. Here the professors are
divided. Dr. Ortmayer believes the
war will see no quick end while Dr.
Shi feels differently.

“The length of this war is de-
termined in part by the weather
because of the dependence on air
strikes. However, I believe that
within the next two weeks we will
start to see mass defections of Iraqi
soldiers and in 6-8 weeks the allies
will control Kuwait."
