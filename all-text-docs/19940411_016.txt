SPORTS

Women's track & field runs strong

By Jean DeMoss

This past weekend over 80
track teams and clubs journeyed to
Durham for the Duke Invitational
track meet. Teams travelled from
as far away as Michigan to com-
pete, and the field boasted a few
Olympic athletes. Davidson par-
ticipants were in the thick of the
action.

The meet started Friday after-

noon with the 400m hurdles. Jun-

ior Maria Whitehead ran a blitzing
67:8. Freshman Lara Burkholder

Hammerin' Hank's heroic home run

Hank continued from page 14

until the following spring for the
broken record.

Atthe time of his retirement in
1976, Aaron held the record for
most games played, at-bats, RBIs,
and extra-base hits, while being
ranked second in hits and runs
scored.

Still, when people discuss the
greatest players of all time, rarely
does hank Aaron surface. Usually

names like Ruth, Mays, Mickey

Mantle, Ted Williams, Ty Cobb,
and Pete Rose come up first. Aside
from the achievements he made on
the field, what Aaron survived off
the field can be hard to believe. He
was forced to make reservations at
several hotels to conceal his loca-
tion, and an armed bodyguard ac-
companied him everywhere he
went.

The current generation has
never witnessed such hate mail to
an athlete based on his skin color.
To believe just 20 years ago people

went to such extremes is unimag-
inable.

Hank Aaron has not been put
on the pedestal he deserves, then or
now. When the subject of greatest
players surfaces, remember Hank
Aaron, not just for statistical rea-
sons, but for what he achieved while
black players endured such blatant
discrimination. How could our
national pastime treat some of its
best players with so little respect
when they should have been treated
like heroes?
