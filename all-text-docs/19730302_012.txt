...Open House: An Institution

(Continued From Page 1)
else to do,’ he said.

Burts recollected that with a
different era there was a dif-
ferent type of student. He
suggested that students today
are more sophisticated.

According to Burts, students
used to be more dependent on
the faculty.

There were relatively few
cars on campus and so students
looked more to the town of
Davidson--to the professors,
their families and their
daughters.” Burts said.

‘With the removal of Vespers
and the advent of auto, stu-
dents looked elsewhere for their
relationships. With the options
of either going to someplace
like Winthrop or to an open
house, the open house suf-
fered,’ Burts related.

“The prevalent attitude used
to be one of more friendliness to
professors.’ Burts continued.

“Students used to seek out
relationships with professors
outside the classrooms. They
regarded these relations as part
of their education,’ he said.

“I'm not sure students want
that anymore and _ therefore
don't seek it,” commented
Burts.

The program in the past,
although generally viewed
favorably. was a strain on
faculty members’ wives.

Mrs. Thomas Pinkerton
recalled that often they had
“too many students. perhaps 25
to 30, to have a_ good
discussion.”

She described open houses as
being rather difficult. “I just
couldn't tell how many students
would show up,” she said.

Long remembered that often
the cooking ability of the wives

had a “great amount to do with
how big a draw her husband
would have.”

Long said that open houses
were often a burden for faculty
wives though, since there was no
way to tell how many students
would be coming.

Long summed up_ the
program by saying that “it was
a nice way to wind up the
weekend."

Welsh’s Symphony Premieres

A new symphony using an
electronic synthesizer, a device
capable of producing sounds
unlike those of any ordinary
musical instrument, has been
written by Music Professor
Wilmer H. Welsh for the
Charlotte Symphony Orchestra.

The orchestra will premiere
Welsh's “Symphony No. 1 in E
Flat" at 8:15 p.m. March 7 in
Ovens Auditorium.

“There is much _— ex-
perimentation being done with
electronic music today,"’ Welsh
said. “It was my goal to
produce a symphony using the
synthesizer in a way that can be

appreciated by the eoncert
audience--not something
restricted to professional

musicians, as some electronic"
works have been."’

Since operating a synthesizer
is a highly complex process,
Welsh is preparing a tape recor-
ding of synthesizer music for
the symphony. An operator will
play the tape recorder as if it
were another instrument in the
orchestra.

“My work is in four
movements and lasts about 25
minutes in ali,” Welsh ex-
plained. ‘The synthesizer tape
will be used in all but the last
movement. The entire sym-
phony is based on a three-note
motive. The synthesizer does
things with these three notes
that no other instrument could
do”

A synthesizer works because
music is really composed of
tones produced by vibration, he
continued. In the synthesizer
the vibrations are electronic in
origin. These vibrations can be
modified in many ways to
produce a range of sounds that
can be as low and slow as a bass
drum or as high and fast as a
whistle. They can sound
resonant or dull,

Their rhythm can be varied
regularly or randomly. And the.
synthesizer operator controls it
all by switching electrical con-
nections and by running his
fingers across an amazing
‘‘keyboard’’ which responds to
the heat in the operator's
fingers!

Welsh was asked to compose
his work for the Charlotte Sym-
phony by its conductor, Jacques
Brourman. Brourman did not
specify that the work include
electronic music.

“Integrating the tape with the
other instruments in the or-
chestra presents many con-
ducting problems,’ Welsh
noted. ‘‘Mr. Brourman seems
excited about solving them."’
