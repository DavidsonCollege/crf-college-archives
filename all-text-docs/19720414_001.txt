Registrar Uses Computer

For Fall Term Registration

By MIKE TANNER
Asst. Managing Editor

A new registration system will
go into effect this spring where-
by students, beginning with sen-
iors, are randomly placed in
courses according to course
preference cards, Registrar
Richard C. Burts Jr. announced
this week.

On or about April 21 each
student who has paid the tuition
deposit for next year will re-
ceive, along with other perti-
nent information, six IBM reg-
istration cards.

Placing his name and alpha

number on all six, the student
will place his first preference
for each of his three classes on
three separate cards and his
second preferences on the other
three.

After the cards have heen
filled out, students will deposit
them in person in the Regis-
trar’s office on May 2, 3 or 4
between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.

After all of the cards are in,
the computer will draw up a
random order for all seniors,
juniors and sophomores, sepa-
rately, and process them beg‘n-
ning with the Senior Class.

Teaching Evaluated
By EPC Committee

By DOUG BROWN
Managing Editor

An ad hoc Commititee on Eval-
uation, chaired by Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs John
M. Bevan, has begun the imple-
mentation of a comprehensive
evaluation program of instruc-
tion at Davidson.

Bevan said, “It is extremely
important in a small institution
such as Davidson that we con-
stantly re-evaluate what small-
ness means in terms of student-
faculty relations.”

The Committee on Evaluation
has discussed the need for pro-
fessors to return reviews in a
reasonable time period. Bevan
explained that this was one of
the indices of the quality of a
college.

“A student should not have to
wait until the day before a re-
view to get the previous review
back,” Bevan said. He pointed
out that there are very few
faculty members with a heavy
student load.

The necessity of having an
adequate evaluation of reviews
was another topic dealt with by
Une Committee on Evaluation.
It was the feeling of the com-
mitvee that a grade on a re-
view was uot enough. A grade
was felt to have some symbolic
importance, but comments on
the returned review were the
best way a student could judge
his strengths and weaknesses.

The committee also discover-
ed that some professors relied
too much on objective testing.
“Students should be able to ex-
press themselves in writing.
This reflects on the quality of
the institution,” commented Be-
van.

One of the strengths of a
small college should be the ac-
cessibility of faculty members,
the committee concluded. Con-
sultation should be an integral
part of the educational experi-
ence.

Processing will be as follows:
beginning with the seniors, when
the random order has been
drawn up, the computer will
go through the cards and give
everyone his first choice wher-
ever possible.

When the senior cards have
been run through once, the com-
puter will give all juniors their
first choice, again wherever pos-
sible, and likewise with the
sophomores.

All cards having been process-
ed once, the computer will be-
gin again with the seniors and
give the second choice to those
who didn’t get their first, and
again likewise with the juniors
and sophomores.

According to the Registrar’s
office, the new system will make
much greater use of the com-
puter, thus maximizing efficien-
cy and equity for all students,
as well as reducing the time
and energy necessary for com-
pleving registration.

From the students’ point of
view, it will solve the problem
of the long tiring line.

Some students, however, ques-
tion whether this system will
deprive upperclassmem of a cer-
tain amount of privilege in re-
gard ‘to sign-up. This seems to
be the only real objection.

Commenting on this, Vice
President for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan pointed out that
despite the random order pre-
pared by the computer, seniors
are still being processed first so
that they are given priority.

Bevan also emphasized that
upperclassmen who are unable
to get needed courses with this
system will be dealt with on_an
individual basis and will most
likely be allowed to break ceil-
ings where necessary. ‘“We can’t
deny that we have a caste sys-
tem around here and we still
try to recognize this,” Bevan
said.

the Patterson and Davidson sub-
committees for a very thorough
study. They turned out a pro-
posal which was both logical
and flexible enough to he ad-
justed to fit changing conditions
inthe future.

“I think that the taculty vote
represented a step in the mght
direction. I was not, however,
surprised by the overwhelming
support that the facully gave
the proposal because of the re-
sults of the previous facuty
poll,”’ Spencer said.

The actual tnotion that the
faculty passed stated that the
faculty approved the EPC re-
port and received the attached
copy of the Budget, Building
and Grounds Committee (BBGC)
report as additional information
on the cost estimate.

Spencer explained that the fac-
ulty accepted as additional in-
formation rather than approved
the BBGC report because it did

not want to be committed to the
financial guidelines drawn up
by the committee in the possi-
bility that sometime in the fu-
ture it might not he fjnancially
feasible to continue to. increase
the enrollment of women at the
projected rate.

‘‘However, the committee did
not intend its part of the report
to be used as a binding com-
mitment, but rather as a pro-
bable estimate,’’ Spencer noted.

The proposal sent on to the
Trustees may be amended or it
might be left intact. In any case,
it represents only general guide-
lines for coeducation which may
be revamped at any time by the
Trustees in the light of changing
conditions, Spencer scuted.

Spencer elso reported that the
literature and news releases will
he ready to go us soun as the
Trustees make their decision,
so that prospestive girls can be
notified immediate',’.
