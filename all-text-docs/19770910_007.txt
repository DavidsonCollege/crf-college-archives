Sickness downs Pritchett

By MATT WALL
Staff Writer

Davidson basketball is al-
ways a great subject for
rumor, and the rumor mills
have been grinding to greet
returning students with the
news that Coach Dave Prit-
chett had been ill and hospital-
tzed all summer and’ may be
unable to coach this year.

The fact is that Coach
Pritchett has been in the
hospital but may be back in
Davidson this weekend.

In a Wednesday interview,
Mrs. Judy Pritchett explained
that her husband had been
very tired after the pressure
and frustration of last year’s
grueling season of coaching
and recruiting, but that no one
was aware of any serious
health problems until June.

In late June, Coach Prit-
chett remained ‘‘superrun-
®iown, ’’ overweight, and be-
gan.suffering dizzy spells
which were later attributed to
a ‘‘low blood count or ane-
mia.”

He was admitted to Char-
lotte’s Presbyterian Hospital
for rest, observation, and
tests.

When Coach Pritchett’s
condition warranted further
tests and more extensive diag-
nostic treatment, he was sent
to Minnesota’s Mayo Clinic.
Area hospitals around Mayo
Clinic were to conduct more
tests Wednesday to determine
the cause of his disorientation
in balance.

The tests were to be admini-
stered by an eye, ear, nose,
and throat specialist who be-
lieves Pritchett may be suffer-
ing from a sinus staph infec-
tion. Apparently the infection
had been dormant in Prit-
chett’s system for years but
surfaced when nervous ex-
haustion and the blood prob-
lem had lowered his bodily
resistance.

Mrs. Pritchett expressed

confidence that her husband
would return to limited coach-
ing duties in a couple of weeks
and resume full responsibili-
ties when medication and fur-
ther rest have completed the
coach’s recovery.

Also on Wednesday, Athle-
tic Director Thomas Cartmill
said that Pritchett had been in
and out of the hospital most of
the summer. Cartmill had
expected Pritchett to return
last Friday, September 2, but
more routine tests had to be
made this week. °

The A.D. stated that the
college was considering the
situation on a day-to-day ba-
sis and could not predict when
Pritchett might return to full
coaching practices.

Asked what might happen if
Pritchett should be unable to
coach the team this year,
Cartmill expressed confidence

Football preview

Farrell foresees turnabout

By JEFF CLARK
Staff Writer

After two weeks of one of
his most strenuous pre-season
workouts Coach Ed Farrell
sees what he calls the ‘‘cul-
mination of four years of
work.”

He foresees Davidson’s
football team turning the cor-
ner on the win/loss record and
enjoying a winning season for
the first time since 1969.

At the end of pre-season
practice Farrell pointed out
several very positive aspects

in the coaching staff and

implied that they could take

up the slack. However, Cart-
mill admitted that he had not
talked to President Spencer or
the administration about such
a contigency.

Cartmill explained that
when Pritchett does return,
the assistant coaches should
do most of the traveling and
recruiting, relieving Pritchett
of much pressure and allowing
him to concentrate his skills
on being a ‘‘floor coach’.

While the specific diagnosis
and prognosis on Coach Prit-
chett must wait until his
return to Davidson, indica-
tions are that his rest and
recuperation are essentially
complete. Students and all
concerned with Davidson Col-
lege are anxious for Pritchett
to return and have a good
year.

for his fourth year as head
coach at D.C. Of the 95
players who reported to prac-
tice, 95 are still healthy, which
is an oddity in the game of
football.

Coach Farrell reports depth
and experience at many of the
key positions.

In their wing-T offense the
Wildcats have two quarter-
backs, Bob McCarthy and Al
Rhyne, two fullbacks, Page
Walley and Mark Hooper and
three halfbacks, Pete Legler,
Eddie Setzer, and Craig Pyles.

McCarthy and Walley will
start while the three halfbacks
should get equal playing time.

The Cats are blessed with
four outstanding linebackers:
Cliff Hester, Jarry Taylor,
Terrell Rhye, and Gary
Stokes. Although Hester and
Taylor will start Coach Farrell
stated all four will see plenty

KING OF

of action. '

Hester joins offensive guard
Chip Howell and defensive
tackle Frank Fields as tri-cap-
tains this year.

Despite the fact that this
year’s freshmen are consider-
ed the most talented we've
recruited, only six of the 37
recruits will travel to Fordham
for Saturday’s game and only
kicker Bob Lankenau is a
starter.

Farrell feels that he has too
much experienced talent retur-
ning to start his talented
freshmen but several should
see action.

Farrell stated that he was
not particularly relying on
either offense ér defense but
instead on team balance.

He sees no- unusual

strengths in his 1977 squad
but neither does he see any
glaring weaknesses.
