budget of $1,050.00 he should be
able to do this.

Alexander agrees that some
of the functions of the RHC are
unclear, and he believes that
this is due in some degree to
the interference of Director of
Student Housing Mrs. Peter Ni
cholls. ‘‘She seems to do any-
thing she wants to do. No mat-
ter what the RHC decides to
do, she’ll have some say in it.”

In 1966 Nicholls was one of
the originators of the idea of a
Residence Hall Association to
which all those living in the
dorms would belong and_ the
Residence Hall Council would
be the governing body Although
she recognizes that the new Con-
duct Council and dorm man-
agers will infringe on some of
the functions traditionally given
to the RHC, she believes that
there is a definite place for the
RHC.

Nicholls feels that it is un-
fortunate that the RHC has
reached such a low point in
such a short period of time.
She said that if Alexander would
show stronger leadership, the
RHC could become a potent
force on campus.

Nicholls criticizes the RHC
for failing to live up to its re-
sponsibilities. ‘‘Last spring the
RHC was supposed to write up
regulations about refrigerators
in the dorms. Although it pro-
posed that refrigerators not ex-
ceed 6 cubic feet, it made so
many exceptions that all types
of refrigerators were given
carte blanche. The only real
restriction was that those re-
frigerators exceeding 6 cubic
feet would have to be inspected
by the RHC,” she said.

“IT have sent two letters, to
Bill Alexander this fall in re-
gard to the refrigerator regis-
tration procedures, and I have
yet to receive a reply from
him,’ Nicholls added. “I am
now forced to make arrange-
ments on my own in regard to

the registration of refrigera-
tors.”
Senior Class Senator Cecil

Burney was the president of the
Residence Hall Council until last
winter, and he decrys the pre-
sent state of this organization.

“The RHC has the resources
and position to plan appealing
programs for the whole college
community,” said Burney. “Un-
fortunately, the RHC has not
provided any of the social func-
tions which would have been

positive.”

“I feel Bill Alexander has
been selfishly more interested
much of the time in trying to
keep his select little group of
SPE’s going than he has been
in providing activities for the
whole campus,” he said.

Alexander feels that the RHC
has accomplished much since
he took office this past winter.
“We have effectively combated
the use of firecrackers in the
dorms.”

However, Dean of Students
Will H. Terry feels that the
firecracker problem was solved
by the student body in general
joining together in opposition to
the use of firecrackers, and that
the RHC’s impact was minimal.

Other accomplishments Alex-
ander lists are the report on
married student housing, the re-
port calling for the housing of
coeds in Duke, and the report
calling for the housing of fresh-
men in Belk.

“Reggie Kennedy’s coeduca-
tion report asked that coeds
be housed in Duke,” Alexander
said. ‘‘This was proposed by
the RHC, and I felt slighted
that the RHC got no credit for
the idea. Kennedy’s report per-
taining to coeds in Duke was
almost verbatim from the RHC
report last spring.”

In response to Alexander’s
charge, Kennedy said, ‘The
SGA coeducation committee did
not intentionally copy the RHC‘s
proposal. The important issue

ARA Proposes Food Service
At Three Fraternity Houses

By TOM AINSWORTH
Staff Writer

A food service’ distributed
over three fraternity houses
next year was proposed by cafe-
teria manager Ron Scott at a
meeting of the Union food com-
mittee last Thursday.

Scott recommended that the
food service move and expand
the existing facilities over three
fraternity houses on Patterson
Fraternity Court, two of which
have been secured. ‘he central
one would be a_ combination
Snack-Bar and cafeteria, from
which all the food would be

is not who first proposed the
idea, but whether some action
is ‘aken on the idea. The SGA
coeducation committee has act-
ed, and the RHC has not,” Ken-
nedy said.

And Clodfelter claims that
the RHC, under Alexander, was
not the first to propose moving
coeds into Duke. He said that
a similar proposal had _ been
brought up in the senate pre-
viously.

“IT hope to see big refrigera-
tors with compartments for in-
dividuals for each hall, and I
think that kitchen units for each
hall would be appropriate,” he
said, ‘‘The RHC should help de-
cide what types of dorms David-
son should have in the future,
and the future use of old dorms
must be decided upon,” he said.
Alexander forsaw the walls of
the present dorms being knock-
ed out to allow for suites.

Clodfelter said, ‘‘The RHC,
unless radically revised, has no
practical future.”

cooked and then transferred to
the other two.

The second would be a grill-
delicatessan type and the third
a family buffeteria.

Scott also proposed the use
of a transferrable booklet of
meal tickets. It would be punch-
ed according to the meal cost,
and would last roughly 18 to
24 weeks.

Being transferrable, it could
be used to buy a date’s meal
or be given to a friend.

“Everybody we've approach-
ed with this plan has been very
favorable to it,’’ said Scott.
‘But,’ he continued, ‘‘there's
only one drawback — people
don't spend it fast enough."’

In addition, Scott sees doing
away with the numerous vend-
ing machines, being too costly
and time consuming to main-
tain.

Danny Clodfelter, student
body president, thinks this plan
is good on the whole. ‘‘The on-
ly big problem in it,’’ he said,
“is that in the thinking of
Scott, the three houses would
treat an even division of stu-
dents. But what happens when
there’s an overload at one?”

Two members of the Food
Committee, freshmen Len Gil-
les;ie and Chip Jones, differ
somewhat over the elements in-

volved. “‘The plan they pre-
sented was good,’ said Gil-
lespie. ‘‘Buying meals would

give more freedom and flexi-
bility to the present system."’

Rut ine is apprehensive as to
how the third house will be
acquired, since no other houses
are presently available.

Jones forsees a disruption of
siudent unity in following this
course. ‘“‘He also believes that
a ‘unionless’ college might de-
‘er a prospective student, and

Traffic Court Forms
To Handle Tickets

By JOHN KEPCHAR
Staff Writer

A traffic court composed of
two students and one member
of the administration will meet
every Tuesday at 10 a.m. in
room 228 Chambers for any stu-
dents who wish to protest traf-
fic tickets, according to Danny
Clodfelter, student body  presi-
dent.

The court will be composed
of sophomore’ senator John
Douglas, freshman senator Bob
Corlew and Steve Heckard, ex
ecutive director of the Wildcat
Club.

Many signs have been torn
down on campus, and some stu-
dents may wish to protest a
ticket they received for park-
ing in an area which was not
marked, Clodfelter said.

Students are responsible for
knowing where they can and
cannot park, according to Grov-
er C. Meetze Jr., director of the
physical plant. Although some
signs may be missing this does
not automatically entitle him to
park where he wishes, Meetze
said.

The court will have power to
dismiss the $2.00 ticket fees
which are given for parking in
a reserved or prohibited area,
exceeding the 20 mph. campus
speed limit, or using an unre-
gistered car.
