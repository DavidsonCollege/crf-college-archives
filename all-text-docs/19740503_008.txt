The Davidsonian

Brickel’s Recruitment Policy Stresses

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

‘(Ed. Note: The following is an
in general,

between Davidson head basketball
coach Bo Brickels and the author.)

‘We have really tried very hard this
year and I feel we have done as much
as we can do up to ths point.”

That statement came from Bo
Brickels, the man who succeeded
Terry Holland as Davidson’s mentor
in basketball, after Holland left for
Virginia. He was speaking on
recruiting basketball players for his
first season as head coach.

There is an air of honesty that
surrounds the silver-haired coach
which convinces the listener that he is
not doing anything but giving you the
facts. His enthusiasm that con-
tinually overwhelms anyone around
him testifies to his dedication to the
game.

And in basketball, a big portion of
the game is recruiting.

Both Brickels and his two assistan-
ts, Jim Laranaga and Harry Kuhn, go
about their business with that en-
thusiastic flare that is so very vital to
the recruitment of good cagers.

“We have lost three of the best
athletes that we could possibily have
gotten for our program,” commented
Brickels. ‘‘They were really super
prospects, just perfect for what we
needed to build our program. They
might possibily have been the most
perfect that we have ever had here.”

Yet, despite the apparent
devestation that the loss of these three
top should have meant to
the leaders of the Cat cage program.
Brickels and his staff are still moving
forward in their never-ending efforts
to sign the key players. And they still
have their enthusiasm.

“Jim and Harry both think we are
going to pull through this thing,”
Brickels explained with a smile. ‘‘And

As Farrell Signs Prospects

I believe we are too.

“But I am not that concerned
because we really have put forth the
efforts. And that’s what counts. It is
just very unfortunate that there is not
something super to show for them.”’

Brickels went on to note that ‘“‘We
finished second on all three”’ of the top
prospects that the Cat coaches had
their eyes on. From this point he
moved into a discussion of recruiting
and what problems he and his staff
face when they seek to sign potential
players.

“There are two ways to look at the
situation,’ Brickels explained.

‘First, we can start looking for 15
players every year who are that per-
fect for our program. Somewhere in
the country, we have to locate all 15 of
them. Then, by the law of averages,
we will get the three that we need so
badly.

“‘We have to find the players who
have good academic reputations, who

in recruiting players, you have to be
conscious of the what things are for
each individual. Only then can you
begin to solve the little problems that
cause you to lose the valuable
players.”’

Brickels then launched into
describing just what takes place when
the recruiting program is running in
high gear.

“‘Let’s say that we send out 5000
questionaires to prospective players
during the summer and early fall,”’
Brickels hypothesized. ‘“‘Then you
figure that we get half of them back.
So we are down to 2500 prospects
before we even get started.

‘Then we look at the ones that could
be academically qualified, or close to
that range. By now, the list is down to
somewhere in the neighborhood of
500, one tenth of the number of
questionaires we started with.

“From here we look at how many

you haven't already been in contact
with them. And I think that this is
rightfully so.”’

What Brickels sees as the optimism
recruiting system is where they can
be to the level of about 50 players or so
by the opening of the season. This
would allow each of the three David-
son coaches to go see all of the kids
play and get to know them.

‘We really do not want one person
doing the mid West, one the South,
etc.,”’ Brickels pointed out. ‘“‘We want
everyone to be involved with all the
kids we go after. That makes for a
good recruiting system.”’

“If we can get the administrative
work and the leg work done before the
season starts, then we will be able to
go out and get the players interested
in Davidson.

“This is the first and most im-
portant part of the process. If it is not
done in an efficient and effective man-

played on good high school teams, and
who have the qualities that will help
our program.
“Second, we could take the ap-
proach that we are always going to
finish second when it comes to
recruiting the players who are perfect
for our program. If we take this
viewpoint, then we have to figure out
why we are finishing second.

‘“‘We would find out that it is the lit-
tle things. And, when you are involved

are the caliber basketball players that
are possible prospects for our

We then would have a working
group of about 50 names.”’

All this has to be done prior to the
first of December, in order to have
made initial contact with these
players and their high school coaches,
according to Brickels.

“After their season starts, they
write you off their list,” he said “‘if

ner, then you are in big trouble.”
As for his philosophy of recruiting,

The switch to a grant
program based on need has
not at all slowed down the
recruiting of football coach Ed
Farrell. 29 football players
have signed thus far, and
likely Farrell and his staff are

far from through.

Early in April, Dave Arnold,
a 5-11, 200 pound linebacker
from Blakely, Georgia signed
with the Cats. Arnold
averaged 10 tackles a game
and was an all-state player
both as a junior and a senior.
In addition to winning three
football letters, Arnold played
basketball, ran track and
played golf at Southwest
Georgia Academy.

Coach Farrell went to the
hunting ground of Bo Brickels
to sign two Ohio stars, Chris
Harris of Dayton and James
Spisah from Youngstown.

Harris is a 6-2, 210 pound
tight end and Spisah a 6-1, 230
pound center-tackler. Both
were stand-outs on their high
school teams.

Farrell commented, ‘“‘Some
of the best high school football
in the country is played in
Ohio. We believe we have just
recruited two very fine
players with excellent football

backgrounds.”’’

Farrell must also be very “We got a late start in
high on Florida high school recruiting this year. But we

linemen from the sunshine recovered a lot of lost
state, along with Chuck Vones, ground," Farrell said. ‘‘One of

a 6-0, 170 pound safety.

Hialeah High School in
Miami contributed Vones and
teammates Joe Serra, a 6-4,
230 pound offensive and defen:
sive lineman, and Bennie Fun-
nell, a 6-3, 230. pound center.
Serra was honorable mention
on both the Miami News and
Herald All City teams.

Also from the Miami area,
all-city selection Louis Abreu,
a 6-1, 215 pound offensive
lineman has been signed to a
grant. A two year starter at
Southwest High, Abreu has
been a track and wrestling
star in addition to his football
playing.

Ken Griner, 6-1, 180 pound
linebacker ; Dave Jordan, 6-2,
210 pound defensive tackle,
Pat Foster, 6-2, 220 pound
lineman and Ken Bell, 5-11 195
pound linebacker-tight end
are other Floridians signed by
Farrell.

Bell was an all-city selection
from Pensacola who averaged
36 yards a punt along with 9
tackles and three assists per
game. Jordan, Foster and
Griner all were bullwarks of

excellent high school’ defen- '

the reasons we feel this way is
the success we have had in
Florida. We have signed some
fine athletes from that area.

Joel Wilson, a 6-1, 245 pound
guard and Joel Golmont, 6-1,
175 pound quarterback, two all
conference players from
Beaver Falls, Pa. have signed
grants with Davidson.
Wilson's size will make him
one of Davidson's biggest foot-
ball players and his speed is
excellent for a big man.

Golmant rushed for 700 yar-
ds last season and passed for
400 more. He scored nine

touchdowns and passed for
five more.

Assistant Coach Dave
Roberts claims Bill Jolley of
Atlanta, a 6-3, 215 pound
lineman is ‘‘one of the finest
football players we have had
to come to Davidson.”

“Bill is talented, has ex-
cellent range and is quick. He
is an all around athlete who is
going to be a tremendous asset
to our student body,’’ Roberts
said.

Farrell and his staff have

signed twenty, line. prospects, .
