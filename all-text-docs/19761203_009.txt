Boyce, ‘Beach’, &E Broads - ‘No Sir!

To the Editor:

Dear Mr. Boyce,

Frankly, as far as I’m concerned,
you can put your article on Discos
where the sun don’t shine, you

- impudent little pile of stink. What do
you think Davidson is anyway, you
saucy little stewhead? Red China?
Pinko Russia? Waleyville, N.C.? It’s
a free country, isn’t it? To be blunt,
you snot-nosed little cow’s rump, I
can listen and dance to whatever
music I darn well please (excuse my
language).

I’m not a fag, but even if I was
(how despicable!), it shouldn’t matter
in this country of free choice. If I

want, in vulgar terms, to ‘‘ply my
wares,” I have just as much right to
do so to the Disco beat and in the Dis-
co knits as you do to your drug inspi-
red Grand Funk Railroad and in your
sweaty, putrid little blue jeans (prob-
ably second-hand, you penny-pinchin’
little pinhead).

If I know how to move my parts to
the Hustle, by golly I have the right
to show the world (including C. Shaw
Smith and even Sam Spinster,.
whoops, Spencer, for that matter).
Why don’t you go down to Cuba,
where you belong, you little pimpled
puke!? And take your, Led Zeppelin
with you. I'll take Steph Flowers
anyday and gladly ‘‘lay down and
boogy and boogy, boogy, boogy til I
die.”’

Yours sincerely,
Georgianna “Gotta Have
the Bump” Ziggler '80

troop ships.

To the Editor:

I would just like to commend
Davidson Coilege on their fine stu-
dent body, and especially those fine
gentlemen at the SAE house. I am a
student at the University of North
Carolina, but.I happened to be in
Davidson last Monday night and
attended the party at the SAE house.

The SAE brothers were all dressed
so nicely in khaki pants, button-down
collar shirts, and ‘‘alligator’’ sweat-
ers. I wondered if they had all called
each other up and planned to wear the
same clothes. They all even had on
the same kind of shoes, ‘‘Topsiders’’.
I couldn’t imagine why they all had
on sailing shoes in the middle of the
winter, but they seemed so proud of
them I didn’t ask why.

The band they had at the party was
really great, too. I had never heard of.
any of the songs they played, but the
SAE’s loved them. They just kept

yelling ‘‘Beach, beach!”’ over and over
again.

Concerning Long, Spencer, Scott,
and assundry other lug wrenches

To the Editor:

Quite frankly, I was appalled by
the students’ lack of apparent interest
in the recent election. Don’t. you care
what goes on in your country? It
appears not. While its manifestations
are too numerous to count, your
problem is singular: isolation. Too
long you’ve trotted out your petty
objectives in the ivory tower. What
do you know of the real world? Of true
work? Of deprivation and the cut-
throat business that is free enter-
prise? Why don’t you leave your
cloistered carrels every now and then
and open your eyes? There’s more to
this world than who you saw in
Chambers this morning or what to
wear to the next Hospitality Hour!
Take off your petty blinders that you
may see!

With the deepest concern

for the death of
social activism,
Zach Long
P.S. Is it true that penny loafers are
really “‘in’’ again?
Dear Editor:

I was a free man in Paris; I felt
unfettered and alive. There was
nobody calling me up for favors, no
one’s future to decide. You know, I'd
go back there tomorrow, but for the
work I've taken on: raising the money
for all this crap.

Tom Bernhardt

To the Editor:

Who says I’m making a profit? Do
you think I’d-wear these ridiculous
leisure suits if I didn’t have to!?

Dear Editor:

Please.

To the Editor:

Well, it’s already December and
Zach Long still hasn’t produced the
1974-75 Quips and Cranks. | cannot
believe that a college with the
reputation of Davidson could allow
such incompetents, who cannot even
make deadlines, to be associated in
any way with Davidson. There is no
excuse for that issue not being
delivered and I hope that my copy will
be in the mail soon.

To the Editor:

I would like to comment on the
editorial written in the November 5th
issue of The Davidsonian by Bill
Barnett. It smacks so completely of
crass materialism that some answer is
mandatory.

Jim Martin is one of the most
misguided politicians to ever hit the
American political scene. He is a
puppet of the military-industrial com-
plex which is so rampant in the
United States today, and which
threatens to consume us in the fires of
unbridled Capitalism. He and his
right-wing friends on Capital Hill
have exploited the people of America
and milked us to the bone. z

Mr. Barnett obviously supports
Martin and his wicked, vicious at-
tacks on the American people. He is
probably proud of the monopolists
who dictate to the people what. their
lowly existence must entail. The
shackles and chains of Capitalism
have been tightened and tightened by
Martin, Barnett and company until

the working class is at the point of. -

extinction.

The only way out of this vicious
cycle is for the people to unite. The
proletariat must rise and overthrow
our bonds and destroy these Capital-
ist pigs. Then, finally, Dr. McKelway
and the saviors of the common man
can lead us down the road of universal
brotherhood and love.

To the Editor:

I was shocked to hear how bliss
translates into sadness in Urdu. I
need student support for my identity
crisis. :

Dear Editor:

It is not true that I am alive and
well in Mt. Mourne. No. I am alive
and well in Latta. Rudolph Bultmann
is here with me.

Howard Hughes

The “B's ”’ as they fondly called
themselves, were really chasing after
those girls from Salem College. It
seemed to me that they were all ugly,
but one guy told me he would never

_stoop to dating coeds. I guess they

don’t care how the girls look.
Anyway, it sure was fun. eo

To the Editor:

I do not write letters unless I havea ~-
very strong gut reaction to some-
thing. I wrote a number of letters
about Slater last year, so I’m a good
old boy. My gut reaction this year
concerns the infamous boy-girl rela-
tionship. My gripe is that there are
not enough of the sweet things to go
around. Girls, I mean. The female
population at Davidson, because it is
so small in relation to the male
population, causes a lot of problems -
for some of us. I don’t want to sound
like a beserk sex fiend, because that is
not: what I am. I just wish that there
were more girls at Davidson so that at
those times when I am in the library
and I look over and see some goddess
asleep in the sunlight I won't have to
feel like she is already taken. I believe
it was Shakespeare who said, ‘‘All for
one and one for all.’’ That is apropos
here. If there is a girl out there who
doesn't have her quota of three guys
chasing her, well, I’m all for one of
those and I think that there should be
one for all of us deprived males.

Thank you for furnishing such a
fine forum for student expression.

To the Editor:

On a recent visit to the University
of Virginia, I noticed a remarkable
transformation. Those once detest-
able peachpits have now grown into
peach trees which.can be cut down for
firewood. The wonders of nature are
amazing, and I offer this great event
as a source of hope for the coeds of
Davidson College. Contrary to my
earlier opinion, coeds can be useful on
cold, winter nights.

Letters

The Davidsonian solicits
letters to the editor on
almost any subject. Lies
about the faculty and ad-
ministration telling about
their virtues’ will be
trashed.

Letters over 300 words in
length are a hassle to read
so these go down the tube,
too. We may use the ex-
cuse that your letter was
poorly worded or grammat-
ically incorrect.

However, look at the rest
of the paper and you'll see
we can’t write either. Bas-
ically, if we like you, you're
in. Otherwise forget it.
We're the only paper in
town—Do-dah, Do-dah.
