BENJAMIN RICE LACY.

The Fighting Chaplain of the 113th
Field Artillery Now Holds
Important Pastorate.

Benjamin Rice Lacy, ‘06, the son of B.
R. and Mary Burwell Lacy, was born in
Raleigh, N. C., in 1886. There he spent
all the early years of his life, receiving
his early education at Raleigh High
School and the Denison Preparatory
School in Raleigh.

In the fall of 1903 “Ben" entered Da-
vidson College, from which institution
he graduated in 1906. He was a splendid
student, being one of the first men of
his class in regard to scholarship. He
played on the baseball team for three
years and was manager of it his Senior
year. But he was an athlete outside the
realm of baseball also, for when a Senior
he was one of the best quarterbacks that
ever jilayed on a Davidson eleven. He
was a member of the Philanthropic So-
ciety here and of the Kappa Alpha Fra-
ternity.

The year immediately following his
graduation he spent teaching in Decatur
Preparatory School, at Decatur, Ga. In
September, 1908, he received the Cecil
Rhodes Scholarship, being the first Da-
vidson man to be awarded that honor.
Accordingly the years 1908, ‘o9 and ‘10 he
spent in advance study at Oxford. On
his return in 1911 her entered Union
Theological Seminary at Richmond end
finished there in 1914. In the spring of
1914 he made a trip to Palestine and re-
turned through Europe, finding himself
in Switzerland at the outbreak of the
great war.
| Mr, Lacy accepted the assistant pas-
| torship of the First Presbyterian
Church of Raleigh on his return from
| Europe. This position he held until
| America entered the war. Immediately
upon our entrance into the war he was
appointed chaplain of the First N. C.
(later the 113th) Field Artillery. In this
capacity he served throughout the entire
conflict. He joined this unit at Camp
Sevier, S. C., from whence they pro-
‘ceeded to Camp DeColt Quidan, France.
He was in the two great offensive sec-
tors of Mt. Mihiel and Argonne, and
was there cited for bravery. For some
time after the signing of the armistice
he was with the Second Army of Occu-
pation in Luxemburg, Germany. After
several months he returned home, land-
ing at Newport News, Va., on March 17,
1919, and was discharged at Camp Jack-
son, March 29, 1919.

On May 7 of last year Mr. Lacy was
married to Miss Emma White, daughter
of Rev. W. M. White, of the First Pres-
byterian Church of Raleigh, N. C. Last
spring he accepted the pastorate of the
Central Presbyterian Church of Atlanta,
Ga. This is one of the leading charges
in our Southern Presbyterian Church,
and Mr. Lacy is the youngest man that
ever accepted a church of such rank as
this one has. At commencement, 1919,
he was made vice-president of the Da-
vidson Alumni Association; and no bet-
ter man could have been selected.

Ben Lacy, your alma mater wishes
you continued success in everything.

“DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE”
INTERESTS MOVIE FANS

Davidson students were fortunate in
sceing John Barrymore in Robert Louis
Stevenson's famous novel, Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde, fast Saturday night at the
movies. The acting throughout the pic-
ure was excellent and especially so in
the.combined character of Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde. The story had a decidedly
mysterious and gruesome aspect and was
sc well presented that the entire au-
dience was kept in an intense strain at
all times.
Dr. Jekyll, a young physician of Lon-
dow, became interested in the theory
that man is made of two different sets
of characteristics, the good and the bad.
He worked night and day in his labora-
tory trying to find something that would
separate these two human elements and
finally discovered a chemical, which
when taken would change him into a
hideous fiend, passionate, cruel and with
no sense of discretion or care. He also
discovered a substance that would re-
store him to his normal self again. He
soon became a slave to this habit of in-
terchanging himself and would go out
amid the lowest kinds of society as a
Mr. Hyde to join in nightly revels of
drunkenness and cruelty.
Finally in one of these states of mad-
ness he murdered George Carew, the
father of his sweetheart, in cold blood.
beating him to death on the streets of
the city. He became desperate and tried
to rid himself of the habit, but could
not. His chemicals were soon exhausted
and as he could obtain no more he had
to lock himself in his laboratory, for
now the fits came and disappeared with-
out the aid of chemicals. Each spell re-
mained with him longer than any of the
previous ones and he foresaw that he
would finally change into Mr. Hyde for-
ever. He therefore poisoned himself
and ended his miserable life.
