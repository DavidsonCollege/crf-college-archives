Red Cross News

Since our last report the Red Cross
work room has been open six afternoons.
There have been 134 workers present.
Mrs. Archie Brown and Mrs. Walter
Sloan lead the honor roll for punctuality
and attendance. The workers have all
been remarkably diligent and untiring in
their efforts to fill an order for the Char-
lotte work room, which is closed on‘ac-
count of quarantine. There was a great
deal of laborious cutting and stitching
connected with the work. ‘The follow-
ing articles were finished and shipped on
Friday: . Seventy scultetis bandages, 50
pneumonia braces, 50 irrigation pads, 5
operating shirts, 7 pair bed socks.. Some
knitted articles turned in are reserved
for a future shipment. A great many of
the workers have provided themselves
with the regulation uniform, a large
white apron and white “veil.” “Phe di-
rectors of the work room, Mrs. Martin
and Miss Frances Worth, wear the dark
blue veils. Mrs. Archie Brown and
Miss Madge Potts, assistant directors of
work, wear the gray veils. There have
heen several valuable contributions to
the work room. Mr. Hill has provided
a éutting table. which adds greatly to
the comfort of the cutters. Mr. George
Hudson lent a large chiffonier. Mrs.
Sloan, Sr., contributed a feather pillow.
We also thank a kind gentleman for hav-
ing our bulletin boards framed. We
hope next week to have occasion to
thank some one for providing us with
a means of hanging coats and hats in the
work room. ‘‘Verbum sap.”

Our chapter is most fortunate in hav-
ing Miss Frances Worth as superintend-
ent of surgical dressings. Miss Worth
won her certificate in Washington, D.
C., and without her “certified” assistance
we would not be permitted to do the
kind of work we are engaged in.

CAR OF COAL RECEIVED.

The fond hopes that college would
have to be closed on account of a lack
of coal have beén crushed. One carload
of coal has been received and another is
expected any day. The efficiency of our
business manager and treasurer has been
shown again in this way.

TWENTY-TWO MEN.

A short time ago three leading men
spoke at the men’s meeting in Cleveland
on the subject, “Things 1 Wish | Had
Known Before I Was Twenty-one.” G.
Leonard Fels, the first speaker, gave an-
swers sent in by twenty-two men. Here
they are. Every word is worth reading;

I wish 1 had known:

1. What 1] was going to do for a liv-
ing—what my lifework would be.

2. That my health after thirty de-
pended, in a large degree, on what 1 ate
before 1 was twenty-one.

3. How to take care of my money.

4. The commercial asset of being
neatly and sensibly dressed.

5. That a man’s habits are mighty
hard to change after he is twenty-one.

6. That a harvest depends upon the
seed sown—what produces wheat, this-
tles bring forth cthistles, ragweeds will
spoil a good pasture, and wild oats once
sown will surely produce all kinds of
misery and unhappiness.

7. ‘Phat things worth while require
time, patience ard work.

8. That you can't get something for
nothing.

9. That the world would give me
just about what | deserved.

10. ‘That by the sweat.of my brow
vould T earn my bread.

11. That a thoro education not only
nays: better wages than hard labor, but
it brings the best of everything else.
namely, more enjoyable: work, better
food, more of the wholesome luxuries
and pleasures of life, better folks to live
and deal with, best of all, the genuine
catisfaction that you are somebody
worthy of respect, confidence, and the
priceless gift of friendship.

12. That honesty is the best policy,
not only in dealing with my neighbors,
but also in dealing with myself and mv
God. .

13. The value of absolute truthful
ness in everything.

ig. The folly of not taking other
people's advice.

15. That everything which my moth-
er wanted me to do was right.

16. That father wasn't so old-fogy
after all: if | had done as he wished me
to do, | would be very much better off
physically, mentally and morally.

17. What it really meant to father
and mother to raise their son.

18. Whar hardships and disappoint-
ments would be entailed by my leaving
home against my parents’ wishes.

19. More of the helpful and inspir-
ing parts of the Bible—particularly the
four books dealing with the life — of
Christ.

20. ‘Vhe greatness of the opportunity
and joy of serving a fellowman.

21. That fesus Christ is with me as
an elder brother and friend in’ every
activity and relationship of life.

22. That. God's relationship to me is
just as helpful and delightful as that
of a good shepherd toward his sheep.
ora father toward his son.- “Tennessee
Christian.

BIOLOGY LAB. MOVED.

The biology laboratory has been
moved from the infirmary to the old Y.
M. C. A. Social Center, in Morrison
Memorial Hall. The new place is much
hetter for the work than the old one. The
director says that running water will be
installed in a few weeks and many im-
provements made over the old place.
The change was made in order to have
room at the infirmary for the increase
in patients. caused by an invasion of
“German” measles.

@
To say ‘“T'll try’ is good intent
And maybe fills the bill,
But he who makes the most in life
Is apt to say. “I will.”
