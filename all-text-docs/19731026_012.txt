Improved Cat Offense Faces Falcons

Seek Upset &
Tomorrow

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

Coming off an impressive
performance against the
William and Mary Indians last
week. the Davidson football
team will challenge the Falcons
of the Air Force Academy
tomorrow.

Looking at Air Force for a
minute, it appears that thev are
not quite as strong as they have
been in past years. With a 2-3
record for the season, they
return home from a 42-0
smashing at the hands of sucha
rival as Navy. which kept alive
a three-game losing streak.

They have been primarily a
running team as their overall
Statistics show. But against
Penn State they took to the air
for almost 300 yards. So their of-
fensive attack will be versatile.

Defensively they will be more
susceptible to the run than to
the pass. They have given up
twice as many rushing yards as
they have given up through the
air. They have, however, in-
tercepted only three passes all
year.

Until coming to life against
the Indians the Cat rushing at-
tack appeared to be null and

void. But Dave Ingold and Larry
Hardaway, along with Steve
Still and Alton McCallum came
through in the clutch.

Head coach Dave Fagg will
be seeking to repeat the per-
formance in Colarado Springs
tomorrow.

“We really put up a great
fight last week, Fagg com-
mented. ‘We started to put it all
together.”

The idea presently in question
is whether or not the Cats can
do it again.

It will be interesting to see if

LETTER TO THE SPORTS EDITOR

This past Saturday afternoon Davidson
| College's football team suffered its worst defeat
| ever ina contest vs. N.C. State at Raleigh. The
| final score was 68-0.

According to club president Eric Scharling.
| the State club was not that much better than
| some of the other teams we have faced this

season.
*‘We were beaten so badly simply because we
| could only get 13 players together to try to play a
| phy sically larger and obviously far deeper
| squad."

The Davidson club fielded a 37 man squad for
| the previous weekend's home contest against
| Winthrop. So why could we roust only 13 bodies
| for last Sunday's game”

The answer has a lot to do with the philosophy

of club football at Davidson

The prevalent attitude has always been that

Because of this philosophy. the team fielded on |
a given weekend may look very different from
the one of the week before. |

This has almost always been the case. |

One of the keys to the recent improvement in the Davidson offense has been the running of Dave
Ingold. The senior halfback has been bothered by nagging injuries all season but came back to gain 93
yards in 14 carries against William and Mary last Saturday. In all, Ingold amassed 300 yards in th all

purpose running category. Ingold hopes to repeat this performance against the Air Force Academy in
tomorrow's game.

Booters Squeak By Citadel 1-0
On Lone Goal By Grizzard

Staff Writer

The game's only goal was
scored by freshman Bob Griz-

the Citadel game.

‘‘Bain’s performance was
vital to a predominantly defen-
sive game like this one and he
made some great saves,’’ com-
mented Stone.

One of Bain's plays included
the blocking of a difficult one-
on-one penalty kick towards the
end of the game. Bain is now
filling in for regular goalie
sophomore John Mitchell who is
presently sidelined with a
severely bruised hip.

The Citadel came into the
game with an impressive 8-2
record but as a result of its loss
to Davidson. the Bulldogs now
stand 0-1 in the conference.

Davidson's record now stands

5-4-1 and 2-1 in the con-
ference. The Citadel victory is

the third win in a row for the
comebackminded Wildcats.
Tuesday, Davidson will play

St. Andrews, a team wi
winning 8-2-1 record.

Harper Sets
S. C. Record

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

Davidson finally unveiled its
vaunted ariel show last Satur-
day. almost upsetting William
and Mary before succumbing
50-35.

The Cats’ 35 points were not
only the most they had put on
the scoreboard all season, it
doubled their entire production
this year.

The team was paced by quar-
terback Dave Harper who com-
pleted 38 out of 57 passing at-
tempts for 374 vards. Harper's
efforts were good enough for a
new school and conference
record. He was also named
Southern Conference Offensive
Player of the Week.

“The offense finally got
together out there and overall,
it was just a fantastic per-
formance by the whole unit,”
commented head coach Dave
Fagg.

“After the game, I just told
the team that even though they.
lost, they had every right in the
world to be proud of that per-
formance,”’ he continued.

Davidson indeed deserved
Fagg’s praise as the four to five
touchdown underdogs led the
Indians 20-13 at the half.

The Cats were in the game
throughout the second half as
well, coming back to within two
points of their opponents until
the Indians capped a 58-yard
scoring drive with five minutes
left in the game.
