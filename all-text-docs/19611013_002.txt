THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1961

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

Twelve On Trial

This week, as in years past, a
letter went out from the dean's office
to fraternity presidents containing
the dance weekend pledge which the
presidents and the next two ranking
officers of each fraternity will have to
sign in the dean's office Monday morn-
ing.

That pledge reads as follows:

‘T attended the dances and other
campus activities of the dance week-
end referred to above. To the best of
my knowledge and belief, all the
above activities were conducted in ac-
cordance with the standards of the
college. I saw no drinking, nor did 1
see evidence of the effects of drink-
ing, during the dances, at the fra-
ternity house, or at any campus acti-
vity which involved members of my
organization.”

The regulation requiring this
pledge is ridiculously unfair to those
involved, particularly since two new
factors have entered the picture in
the past year. Because of the Honor
Court’s move to include ail official
documents in its interpretation of
lying under oath, this pledge is gov-
erned by the honor system. Secondly,
last year, the student body removed
the “under the influence” rule from
its regulations.

Presidents are now required by
the administration to enforce a rule

for which the student body, the Stud:
ent Council and the Honor Court have
clearly cast off responsibility.

But of more concern, is the bind
in which they find themselves. Most
any president will admit that it is
well nigh impossiblé to go for a week-
end without observing the “effects of
drinking” on the campus. If he is
perfectly honest, he will refuse to

sign the pledge—which would probab-
ly mean social probation or some pun-
ishment for his fraternity, If he com-
promises to save the fraternity, he
violates the Honor System and most
serious repercussions could follow.

Furthermore, any member of the
fraternity aware of the “compromise”
is honor bound to turn in the pledge
signers to the court for lying. Some-
one might take the Honor System
seriously; it would be a messy prob-
lem for the court.

Years ago, another pledge was
required, covering off-campus affairs.
It was discontinued by former Dean
Bailey. The on-campus pledge was
retained, but kept deliberately vague.
No one has ever been specific about
just what it implied or what penalty
would ensue if it were not signed.
Fraternity presidents have been forc-
ed either to turn their heads, or get
others to sign. the pledge, excusing
themselves on the basis of not having
attended all affairs.

Deliberate vagueness is no longer
possible. The new Honor System in-
terpretation seeks to eliminate just
such vagueness in all areas affected
by the system.

Honor Court’ Chairman Harrison
Welford, President George Trask and
this editor appealed to the Executive
Committee several weeks ago to recon-
sider this pledge and eliminate it or
change policy concerning it. A special
request was made for a decision to
come before this weekend. No word
has been heard from them.

We sympathize with those 36 men
and their unpleasant duty and unfair
obligation Monday morning.

Don't Drive “Carefully” - Don't Drive!

Someone told us the other day,
“] consider my car as my own private
property. The college has no jurisdic-
tion over what I keep in it.”

This fellow had been duped, of
course, The administration this year
made it very specific that if a stud-
ent’s car is on college property, the
college has the right to search it if it
so desires.

Whether the student body ap-
proves or disapproves of this is ir-
relevant at the moment. But consider
the possibilities of the idea that a car
is a bit of private property in a wilder-
ness of college-owned land. Or,. to
reverse an image, a car is a wet haven
on a dry sea....

the “car-party.” Ten or 15 carloads of
couples form a circle with their cars,

German Student Views
Reunification Question

BY JURGEN HYE
Richardson Scholar

I would like to dissent with
the opinion presented by Lee
Kirby in the last DAVIDSON-
IAN.

Let me begin with the point
that there can be no reunifica-
tion if the German people and
the “two German Govern-
ments do not want a reunifica-
tion.

Kirby points out that there
are undercurrents of dissension
in the Federal Republic of Ger-
many and in the so called Ger-
man. Democratic Republic.

He says the rightist Catholic
COU has a vested interest in the
division of Germany, since uni-
fication with East Germany
would mean a loss of its present
power.

East Germany is made up
almost entirely of Protestants
and “Communists”. From _ this
statement. we -must draw the

conclusion that West Germany's.

internal politics is a matter of
religion.

To correct thi opinion I
want tc present some facts. In
West .Geormany the Catho'ics
number about 43 neveent of the
population. but, the -f¢ feral slec-.
tion for the Burd st-+
ran 51 parecer: {
with oniy Oo)
votes goiny f.1t
are the 26 per cei! -

of Protestants in favor of the
SPD and ‘where did the CDU
get 8 per cent of the votes of
non-Catholies?

Another example: my home-
town (Schweinfurt) has a ma-
jority of Catholics. Despite this
fact the mayor and most of the
City Counsellors are Social
Democrats.

The conclusion is that the
supporters of the CDU come
from all the nonsocialist circles
of the population and not from
the Catholics only.

The name, Christian Democra-
tic Party. characterizes the
{fundamentals of the party's pro-
cram, which demands Christian
responsibility for political con-
cuct. Protestants are regarded
as Christians, too.

The CDU does not have to
fear the Protestants of East
Cermany. Most of the refugees
join the CDU or support its
annion.

The ideas of the Federal Gov-
ernment have been based on the
principle that German Reunifi-
cation .must come about by

eaccful means only and in
freedom.

The. Four-power Conference
in Berlin in 1954 put forth the
folowing proposals for Germah
‘cunifization: " Free elections
throughout, Germany. and the
convocation of a national as-
sembtly esulting from these
2° ections. ,

The CDU agreement shows
that the CDU does not fear the
Protestants of East Germany.
The Soviet Union rejected
these proposals. There are many
other examples of the efforts
the CDU made for reunification.

Kirby says further: “Many
East Germans are proud of their
own more limited recovery and
in part. idealistic about the
prospects of building a Socialist
state in the homeland of Marx
and Engels,” and “... . reunifi-
cation will endanger the success
of their. Socialist experiment.”

That sounds like East German
propaganda. I do not need to go
into details, because some facts
make these sentences ridiculous.

Is it pride in the “success” of
the Socialist. experiment” that
caused four million people to
leave East Germany or caused
men to fight against tanks with
their fists, with sticks, and with
stones. These actions came only
from desperation.

In conclusion, I wish to say
that the internal politics of the
Federal Republic are not a mat-
ter of religion, that the Federal
Government. which means the
CDU., has. a vested interest in
the réunification, and that, 1
dare to say, 90 percent of the
East. German population is a-
gainst the regime of East Ger-
many, which is dictated by the
Soviet government.

Shoot The Shaft

BY JOHN A. CARSON
Davidsonian Managing Editor

With the announcement of another Dance Weekend,
the Davidson Post Office is suddenly swamped with
letters to girls’ schools near and far.

The answers flowin one by one. For many they are
in the form of a grateful “yes,” but, alack, there are
always those who receive the inevitable shaft.

Shaft letters come in a wide variety of types and
manners. Some are of the “oh so sincere” (in fact, often
nauseating) variety; others, a bit more blunt, “thank you,

but... "5

while still others are downright nasty, the

“would you please quit bothering me” type.

We are indebted to Joe Mattin, president of Beta
Theta Pi, for the following excerpts from actual letters

written to Betas upon various dance weekends.

The

names have been omitted to protect the shafted.
A “martyress” from Salem writes:

“You were so sweet fo ask me to Homecoming, but
| can’t possibly come. | have to attend a YWCA meeting

in Durham that weekend. .. .

a

Not quite so noble, but equally sincere is this poor

lass:

a”

‘d love to come to your Homecoming weekend, no

kidding it sounds so ‘bitchin,’ but I’ve got Saturday
classes that are impossible to cut as well as Friday classes,

and to be quite blunt. . .”

Speaking of studies, how’s this one:

“4 have been out of town for the past two weekends
and just cannot neglect my studies again. .. .”

Thinking that excuse didn’t sound too hot, she tried
to smoothe matters out, helpfully adding:

“If there is anything | can do to help you get some-
one who can come up, please just let me know... .”

Here indeed is a real heart-breaker:

“I really wish | could come up for the weekend of
Oct. 22, but unfortunately Florida plays some silly team
and | have already accepted an invitation to that. | really

do wish | could come up,
fun... .”

because | know we'd have

The cruel hand of Fate often steps in to upset
would-be-romances. Who would have ever guessed that:

“Gosh, the week-end of Oct. 22 really sounds fabu-
fous! | really can’t think of anything I’d rather do.
There’s only one drawback—Sunday afternoon my par-
ents called and said that my sister got engaged Friday

night, and...”

From Mary Baldwin comes this excellent self-evalua-

tion:

“Boy, are you going to think I’m stupid! When 1
wrote accepting your invitation | already had a date for
V.M.I. Midwinters, but | didn’t realize that both your Mid-
winters and their Midwinters were the same. Since U
already had that date, I’m afraid. . .”

One thing about this girl, you’ve got to admit she’s

honest:

“lam sorry to have waited so late before answering
your letter. | will not be able to come to Davidson for
Midwinters. [ also really think it would be better if we
don’t date or write any more.”

And, finally, from W.C.

we get the last word:

“I understand everything in your letter very well.
There’s no misunderstanding or anything. However, a
lot has happened since | saw you last. | have been dating

off and on since Christmas, and at the present

time I'm not dating anybody else. | really and truly feel
that we both would be better off not writing or dating:

each other... .”

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Love,

Pruitt Prociaims Davidson’s Culture - Consciousness

Pruitt

Dear Editor:

There may be a culture anem-
ia rampant at Davidson. but it
seems the editor wouid inform
himself further before express-
ing himself about it. The editor-
ial on this subject in the last
DAVIDSONIAN reminds me of
the misstatements made last
year regarding that oasis of cul-
ture in a desert of apathy, the
Fine Arts Building.

You have hinted that the gala
dedication of this edifice might
be a flash in the pan affair and
ihat gimmics (ie. “different”
approaches) are necessary to
lure the pin-up loving Davidson
Gentleman into culture.

First, I do not think that the
Davidson student is so starved.
Culutre (sic) is not something to
lure people into as if it were a
-jde show at a circus.

The result of that would prob-
ably be the country-club-culture
name-droppers, of which we
have plenty. And the Male chor-
us is not such a glaring excep-
tion as you may think.

In the last three years attend-
ance at organ concerts has in-
creased, the band has a wood-
wind ensemble (will have two)
and a brass ensemble in addi-
tion to its rejuvenated concert
capacity. Not to mention the
musia convocation being re-
peated this year.

Second, an approach similar
to the Vagabonds last year is
not desirable or necessary. The
result of such efforts is a back-
breaking responsibility on a
few, sloppy productions result-
ing from an overly ambitious
program, and, for many, neglect
of studies for a worthy, but

overly emphasized, cause.

__Lastly, the abundance of clubs
2nd organizations are in many
ceses remnants of once vital
groups which are left over in a
hibernating state, but to wake
them all up would be more than
the surprisingly few who keep
them in existence could do.

They are not necessary. A
student body of our size does
not need to try for such diver-
sivication (sic). We can't have
everything and do everything.

A genuine interest in these
clubs and in the fine arts on
the part of the entire student
body would be a boon to us all,
but a crash program to “culti-
vate” us all would be a fiasco.

Lastly (again, as the preacher
said), I should like THE DAV-
IDSONIAN to inform itself ade-
quately on these issues (includ-
ing the articles on foreign stud-
ents and studies) before giving
its words of wisdom.

Agitation for its own sake is
ridiculous. And its worse if it is
not informed.

more light on what must by now
be a perennial question—What
is the funetion of the Richard-
son Scholars?

As I see it the main purpose
of having Richardson scholars
at Davidson is so that they can
promote and foster an interest
in their respective countries.

Indeed, a knowledge of the
background and traditions of
countries less than a day's jour-
ney away should constitute an
essential part of the education
of “The Dayidson Gentleman,”
and it is a pity that the vast
potential of knowledge 4vail-
able is not being more readily
tapped.

Why is this and what are the
Richardson Scholars doing?
Well, as we -have come to a
college, we are expected to
work. We know this, you know
this, and the feculty knows this.

However, so much emphasis
is placed on our academie work,
for which few of us, if any, re-
ceive credit in our own coun-
tries, that those students
whose command of the language
leaves room for improvement
find that they have to spend
much of their spare time im-
mersed in their studies to keep
abreast with the natives.

On top of any’ individual en-
gagements that we may have,

SIOMP! STOMp,

ey

some very worthwhile excurs-
ions are arranged for us which
we really do appreciate. How-
ever, these necessitate our
missing classes and these can-
not but have an adverse effect
on our grades as they are not
easily made up.

Below are a couple of pro-
posals that I feel would help to
restore the balance between
what we get out of Davidson and
what we put in by giving us
more time to discharge our ob-
ligations to the student body.

Work of Richardson Scholars
should be evaluated on an in-
dividual basis. The students
should not be graded relative to
the American system of mark-
ing where their grades would
not afford an accurate indica.
tion of how hard they had work-
ed.

Also, they should be excused
work that they miss when giving
lectures away from the campus
and when participating in or-
ganized excursions, unless the
work missed is directly related
to the work proceeding it. They
would have to make up a class
which was part of a sequence of
classes.

There will be many people
who will resent my criticism
and my “biting the hand that
feeds me” (that is understanda-

ble), but surely in a progres-
sive college such as Davidson
there is room for constructive
Suggestions from whatever
quarter they may come.

I hope that they will each be
considered on their own merits
and I personally feel that should
they be put into practice it will
result in the Richardson Schol-
ars becoming a more integral
part of Davidson Society to the
mutual benefit of all.
