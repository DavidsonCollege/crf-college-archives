Bull run III

By Dave MortLock

Sports Columnist

What makes the Chicago
Bulls one of the most dominat-
ing basketball teams in history,
the only team to ever win over
70 games in an NBA season?

First and foremost, Michael
Jordan. Besides his 32 points a
game and tenacious defense, MJ
also contributes an unparalleled
competitive spirit. Back in the
days, Jordan was the Bulls. He
remains the undisputed leader,
but now, His Airness has a strong
supporting cast with which to
work.

Scottie Pippen, for one, has
benefitted tremendously from
this new team-oriented  phe-
nomenon. Pippen has always
been equally proficient on of-
fense and defense, and he can
run the point or post up. Yet, he
has played under Jordan’s
shadow throughout his career.
But that has all changed.

The greatest thing Michael
did to help Scottie along was to
become a mediocre Chicago
White Sox farmhand as a much-
ballyhooed member of the Bir-
mingham Barons. During
Jordan’s mid-life crisis, Scottie
Pippen filled the position of floor
leader wonderfully and bloomed
into one of the league’s top
perfomers and a legitimate MVP
candidate. Upon Jordan’s re-
turn, Chicago was no longer
“Michael and the Jordanairres.”

It is undoubtedly nice to
have arguably today’s two best
players, but the Bulls don’t stop
there. They also boast the best
set of role players in the league.

Toni Kukoc is a contender
for the league’s best sixth man,
Dennis Rodmanis going to grab
yet another rebounding title,
Steve Kerr shoots three-point-
ers better than Shaq shoots free
throws, and Luc Longley and
Ron Harper are the perfect cen-
ter and point guard for the Bulls.

Yetsuch great players play-
ers don’t automatically rack up
72*wins. Coach Phil Jackson
brings it all together.
responsible for the team chem-
istry, their confidence, and the
record-setting number of victo-
ries.

He has kept crazed Dennis
Rodman relatively sedated, and

‘he has guided Toni Kukoc
through his shortandrocky NBA
career. He knows when to take
conttol and when to relax and
let his players do the work.

So with superstars, great
supporting players, great coach-
ing, and great team chemistry, it
is no wonder that Da Bulls are
possibly the best squad to ever
grace the NBA hardcourt.

Holland revisits past wrestling glory —

By CarLo REYNOLDS
Staff Writer

Dr. Gill Holland, an English
professor here at Davidson from
1961-63 .and since 1967, started
wrestling at Alexandria, Virginia’s
Episcopal High School because the
school required participation in
three sports and, as Holland says,
“I wasn’t any good at basketball.”

The Virginia native played
football in the Fall and tennis in the
Spring. But wrestling became a
life- long interest. He continued
wrestling as an undergrad at Wash-
ington and Lee, discovering the
sport’s real appeal in its strict train-
ing, rigid discipline, and the quest
to win the one-on-one physical and
mental struggle with the opponent.

Again, Holland found that
wrestling helped him meet the de-
mands of his school’s curriculum.
“In college it kept me out of
trouble,” he says with a smile.

Dr. Holland continued to
wrestle in graduate school, work-
ing out regularly with the UNC-
Chapel Hill varsity squad.
According to Holland, a Victorian

and Chinese literature scholar who
writes poems and stand long jour-
ney the athlete travels toward
achievement.

“You can create value,” he
says.
: Although he has not yet writ-
ten creatively about wrestling,
sports have inspired some of
Holland’s poetry. When the
Davidson soccer team defeated
Coastal Carolina on their way to
the NCAA Final Four in ‘92, he
wrote a piece on the intense spirit

- of the athletes and the fans after the

upset victory.

Said Holland, “the emotion at
Davidson was incredible.”

‘During his thirty-one years at
Davidson, Holland has witnessed
changes in spectator interest.

“Support for wrestling was
much greater in the past,” he said,
but he still marvels at the changes
in the sport itself. “Wrestling is a
faster sport now. The athletes are
smarter and better.”

He believes that wrestling at
Davidson is currently in a state of
positive growth, citing new wres-
tling scholarships made possible

by arecent gift from Lowell Bryan,
an alumnus and former wrestler.

Holland attends home meets
and travels to the annual W & L
tournament, following athletes as
they mature over their four years at
Davidson and taking photographs,
afavorite hobby. Getting involved
with the matches and the individu-
als lets him see the sport in new
frames of reference.

“T have a lot of nostalgia con-
nected to wrestling,” Holland says.

He parallels his interest in
wrestling with traveling’s allure.

"Revisting a special season or
sport is a little like revisiting
favortite walking tours,” he says.
“In a sense, one can create value
with each return toa place or match.
They seem more and more pre-
cious with each visit.”

Ours has made those.

An Old Soccer Prophet Wakes up in Mecklenburg Red Clay, Fall 1992

The game has begun. Our kicks are smart, even artistic, thunderous.
The enemy rolls about caught in the net like vicious squirrels.
Pindar, where are you to celebrate this leap and pass?

These are the truly pointy heads and toes.

The enemy opposite, may their keeper suffer the fate of no divine saves.

May their kickers score own goals. May their tricks be ours.
May our defenders deny them salvation unless they cry uncle.

When we close in, may their keeper enjoy

a digestion of scores in the mouth and arms.
May our attackers uncork a cannon ball into their net

May our red clay stick to their shoes.

Crew team strokes to finals in D.C. regatta

The crew team brought its in-
augural season to a close Saturday
with two trips to the finals of the

" Capitol Classic Regatta in Wash-

ington D.C.

As parents, students, and
alumni cheered from the banks of
the Potomac River, Davidson’s
fours rowed their best races to date
in the men’s and women’s varsity
four events.

“We’ve come a long way this

season,” said student coach Jay -

Hinton. “Had we stuck with the
novice races we probably would
have brought home medals, but we
proved we could compete at a
higher level. Our performance in
the varsity events is bigger than
any victory I could have hoped for

this season.” :

When the Wildcats left town
Friday, the crew planned to com-
pete at the novice level. But, Hinton
decided to take advantage of empty
slots in the more competitive var-
sity events. '

Returning from a meeting, he
announced Davidson’s varsity
placement to a surprised team.

“When Jay told us about the
switch (to varsity) I was shocked
andconfused. AtClemson we raced
as novices and came in second to
last,” said Catherine O’ Dell.

“At the time, I thought it was
a risky move, but I knew both
crews had improved since
Clemson,” said Hinton. “I hoped
that the higher placement would
push our boats to their limits.”

The women’s four raced first °
against Franklin & Marshall and

Trinity.
“Jay assured us that we could
stick with the other crew, but I

“When we pulled up to the
dock we thought Scranton’s lead
had certainly ended our season.

think we all had our doubts at the ” Then, Jay told us to rest up for the

start line,” said coxswain Ellen
Rockwell. ;

Franklin & Marshall took an
early lead, leaving Davidson and
Trinity to battle for second place.
The Wildcats kept up the pressure
over the 2000 meter course
outrowing Trinity and earning a
spot in the finals.

The men lined up next with —

University of Scranton and Col-
lege of Charleston filling the re-
mainder of the field. Although
Scranton’s smooth start developed
into a five-boat-length win, the
Wildcats pushed past Charleston
yielding another second place fin-

finals.

believe it.” ee 7

Both crews rounded out the
day with fourth place finishes in
the four boat final events. The
women were clocked in 8:54.62
compared to their 10:41.3 finish at
Clemson. The men crossed the
2000 meter mark in 7:46.24, atwo
minute improvement over their .
9:48.9 Clemson finish.

“This was the club’s second
race ever. Seeing teams like Pitts-
burgh and Miami arriving for
Sunday’s Big East Regatta made it
all worth it. Their programs showed
us what Davidson has to look for-
ward to with the club’s growth,”
said Doug Penhallegon.
