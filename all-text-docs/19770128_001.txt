College neglects deteriorating art ~

By AMANDA HALL
Managing Editor

Fungus is, growing on some of the
paintings in the Davidson Art
Collection.

The paintings, received in a
bequest from the Horton Estate, may
be valuable classics by famous Old
Masters of art.

At present the College is taking no
measures to have these paintings
restored. ‘‘Evidently no one is
working with extreme haste on this,”’
said Director of Special Resources
Julius Melton.

“It’s quite expensive to have the
paintings restored. It would be better
to have these works authenticated so
the experts could give their opinion
whether it is worth it to restore
them,” said Professor of Art Douglas
Houchens. “If any are valuable it’s
absolutely necessary to restore
them,” he said.

Mrs Florence C. Horton, wife of the
benefactor, believed several of the
paintings were genuine, possibly a
Goya, and El Greco, a Sargent and a
Reynolds. .Bob Woodside of the
Tomlinson Collection believes another

acting, repudiated all attributions.
Several professional art dealers and
collectors question the validity of the
Parke-Bernet. assessment because
they have allegedly misvalued
paintings so they could buy them at a
low price and resell them~at the
correct price.

“No one knows what they are, and
that’s why they’re not worried,” said
John Parkerson, who is working with
Houchens. According to him no one
knows how many paintings there
actually are because some were lost in
shipping from Atlanta.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer asked Houchens to “put into
motion whatever procedure he would
like to prescribe to establish
authenticity (or lack of it) for any or
all of the paintings,’’ according to a
memorandum from Spencer to
Houchens.

Houchens and students Parkerson
and Ron Chapple are currently doing

the preliminary work necessary for
the authentication- photgraphing and
cataloguing the collection.

“The students are doing this, and
we usually meet just once a week,”
said Houchens. ‘‘we’ve had these
long time gaps getting the paintings
photographed. But we're all set as
soon as Ron gets three or four more
pictures.”

Houchens was asked to begin work
on the paintings in September.

He is considering sending catalogs
to either the North Carolina Museum
of Art, the Metropolitan, the National
Gallery or the William Hayes
Ackland Memorial Art Center for
evaluation before contacting an
expert to come see the paintings.

He says the catalogs will probably
be sent to the North Carolina
Museum of Art, “because that’s the
nearest museum that has a large
staff. They would be quick to do
something about it.”

Houchens explained that it is
difficult to judge the authenticity of
art works.

“‘That’s why we’re sending the
catalogues to experts. If they are
authentic, several will be quite
valuable, and we’ll know how to take
care of them,’’ said Houchens.

Most of the paintings were placed
in the Archives Office of the library
over the summer because the
temperature and humidity are
controlled there, but several are in
Spencer’s home and one is in the
Wilson Room of the College Union.

Eventually Houchens hopes ‘‘to get
them around the campus, the guest
house, the library and offices-- where
people would see them.’’ He wants to
exhibit a select group of the high
quality works in the new art gallery.

“The paintings would be a foil to
the rest of the Davidson collection
which is mostly contemporary,” he
said.

Women’s applications up

By TOM ENGLE
Staff Writer

Davidson is currently exper-
iencing an increase in the pro-
portion of female applicants.
Admissions Office statistics
reveal that as of January 3,
1975, women comprised 27
percent of the total pool of
applicants received to that
date, whereas applications
from prospective women stu-
dents constitute 38 percent of
the total received to the same
date this year.

This trend raises questions
concerning the degrees of com-
petition for acceptance be-

Snow optimistic on paper

despite continuingproblems

. By PHILIP DUNCAN
News Editor

Editor Tony Snow is optim-
istic that the long-delayed
first issue of The Colostomy
may soon go to press.

“We have enough copy for
almost two issues, but busi-
ness arrangements must be
cleared up before we can send
it in,” said Snow.

This fall Snow and a few
friends organized to create an
alternative to the official stu-
dent media. They named their
publication-to-be The Colos-
tomy, and sold subscriptions
to raise money for printing
costs.

‘*We sold about 100 sub-
scriptions for three dollars
apiece and promised our sub-
scribers fifteen issues for their
money,”’ Snow explained.

‘We've had two major pro-
blems: first, we were all more

ignorant of the inner mechan-
ics of newspaper work than we
thought. And second, I've not
been forceful enough in deal-
ing with the staff. A number
of seniors were interested at
first and paid lip-service to
starting The Colostomy, but
many of them now have
‘senioritis’ and are useless.

‘‘We now have some new
staff members, people with
good newspaper experience,”
said Snow.

Several problems still stand
in the way. “‘Our Business
Manager Mike Morris grad-
uated this fall and took The
Colostomy’s money with him.
He lives in Charlotte though,
so by next week I'll have the
money back. Earlier, Mike
made some arrangements with
the Tri-City News—I need to
check on their status,’’ con-
tinued Snow.

“T also plan to talk to The
Davidsonian Business Man-
ager Warren Soule to see if
The Colostomy can pay the
newspaper for use of its com-
position equipment.”’

Snow has various printing
cost estimates, ranging from
$125 to $300. He hopes to get
some advertisers to help offset
those costs.

Snow believes that publish-
ing the first issue will do much
to stir The Colostomy to life.

“T’d like to print 1000 issues
and inundate the campus with
them—a sort of giveaway
gimmick to draw more sub-
scribers and some financial
contributions to keep: The
Colostomy alive. People will
get excited and be willing to
help. If wé once can produce
something tangible, the staff
will be beholden to do it
regularly,’’ said Snow.

tween male and female appli-

cahts.
Dean of Admissions H.

Edmunds White admitted
that one inescapable implica-
tion of the increase is ‘‘it will
be more competitive for wo-
men than men—no question
about it. The quota-based
admissions system implies
that some lesser qualified men
will be accepted over more
highly qualified women.

“In a sense, we're operating
two separate admissions pro-
grams; we’re after not one
total but two separate totals.
The College’s criteria_for ac-
cepting men and Women are
essentially the same, but the
cut off levels are not,”’

Asked about the possible
implications of Davidson’s ac-
cepting higher caliber womén
than men. in light of the
institution’s traditional pride
in the quality of its male
student, Dean White replied,
‘Yes, we prided ourselves on
our male students because

White

they were the only students we
had. We continue to pride
ourselves on the quality of our
students.

“The fact that the qualifica-

January 28, 1977

tions for our enrolled women
are higher doesn’t mean that
the qualifications for our en-
rolled men are any lower.”

Though Dean White is
‘‘concerned and interested”’
about the stiffer competition
female applicants will experi-
ence in contending for the 110
places open to them next year,
he claims to have no opinion
on whether the women stu-
dents’ contribution to the
College—in terms of academic
achievement and governmen-
tal and other involvement —is
out of proportion to their
numbers.

Similarly, Assistant Dean
of Students Mary Lou Dietler,
in a separate interview, re-
marked that she has ‘‘no basis
for judging whether either
sex’s contribution to campus
life is out of proportion to its
numbers. Why not decide
between Presbyterians and
Baptists?

‘Obviously, women have
made a contribution in every
phase of campus life. They
hold leadership positions just
as men do. I would only be
concerned if women, or by the
same token, if men were
prevented from making a con-
tribution.”’

The fact that Davidson will
be accepting, on the average,
better qualified women than
men raises the possibility that
women will soom surpass the

men in academic achievement.
