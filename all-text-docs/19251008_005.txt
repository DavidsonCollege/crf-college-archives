He sent his couriers into all of the country
to find a happy man, whose shirt the king
could use to sleep in and be cured. But none
could be found. All of the people in his
land had been oppressed until none of them
could claim happiness. One day a beggar
was found rolling in the streets with laugh-
ter, happy as could be. When asked for his
shirt, he replied that he could have it im-
mediately, but he did not have a shirt to his
name. When this sad state of affairs was
reported to the king and he realized how de-
graded his people had become under him, he
