THE DAVIDSONIAN, DECEMBER 2, 1926

Rev. Walker Speaks at

Vesper services Sunday

“Christ Calls His Disciples” Used |

As Subject

The speaker at “Y” last Sunday night |

was Rev. J. M.
Steele Creek Church in
Charlotte. Mr. Walker was a member of
the class of 1907,

Waiker, pastor of
Presbyterian

the

and since his gradua-
tion has taken a real interest in David-
son. While here as a student, he took a
leading part in student affairs, being an
athlete as well as a leader in scholastic
standing.

Mr. Walker built his talk up around
the story of Christ’s calling His disciples,
and showed us that this was the begin-
ning of the Church, and of Christ's teach-
ings. He urged us to pass on to oth€rs
this old, old, story, and to realize the
responsibility which rests on each one of
us in Christ’s plan to save the world. To
illustrate this point, he took as an il-
lustration the incident recounted in the
book “The Christ of the Indian Road,”
in which the people of India are rep-
resented as crying out for the Gospel of
Christ rather than for the civilization or
customs of the western
people seem to care
our habits. They are satisfied with their
own habits, but they are not. satisfield
with their religion. It does not satisfy
the longings of their souls, and they are
crying out to us for something better. If
we fail to give it to them, we are failing
in our duty to God and to our fellow fnen,
and we will be responsible for those who
die in darkness.

These
almost nothing for

world.

As an illustration to show the wonder
and glory of Christ, Mr. Walker used the

, - $
words “come and see” which are found

lin several places in the Bible. When the |

seeing Christ for the first time,

|so different from what she had been that |
all the people wondered, and when they

she told them of

josked her why it was,
Christ. how-
that all she could say when asked
“come and see.” He
told us that if we would only
see” Christ, we would have
believing in Him and in His word. We
cannot meet Christ face to face in the
strictest sense of the words, but we can
learn of Him from. His Word, and
through His glory, and thus learn to

His glory
ever,
to describe Him was
“come and
no trouble

ihe deserves. When one of the disciples

!whom Christ had called met his brother, ,
“come and see.” |

he also used the words
He was so enthused over Christ’s won-
derful personality that he wanted his

brother to see Him too, and he told him |

that he had found the true Messiah, to
“come and see him.”

Mr. Walker urged each one of us to
“come and Christ, and, after we
have seen Him, to show by our lives that

and that we too have

”

we have seen Him,
been won for Him.

track, the football team has appropriated an
adequate sum for the gift.

Coach Tilson started playing football at
V. P. L. in the fall of 1918 and played there
every fall through 1922, a total of five sea-
sons. This rangy linesman captained the
team in 1921; he returned the next year to
help his team through a hard fall.

Since coming to Davidson in 1923 Tilson
has had charge of the Wildcat line. For the
last two years he has had complete charge
of the cinder path stars.

It’s ae easy to like the best

THAT’S why Camel is the most
popular cigarette ever made. In
all tobacco history there has never
been a cigarette preference like
Camel’s. Nothing is too good or
expensive that will make Camels
the world’s finest smoke.

Camel is the friendliest cigarette
ever made. From early morning to
night’s last reluctant parting you
just can’t smoke enough Camels
to tire the taste. Camels are the
celebrated smoke that brought an

end forever to cigaretty after-taste.

If you’ve not yet learned how
really satisfying a cigarette can be,
just try Camels. Into this one cig-
arette the world’s largest tobacco
organization puts every good qual-
ity that could be wished for in a
cigarette. All the mild and mellow
fragrance. The most perfect
blending. The utmost in smoking
enjoyment and contentment,
regardless of price.

Have a Camel!
