: WITH THE ALUMNI :

The DAVIDSONIAN, October 18, 1916

BANQUET GIVEN TO TEAM.

On Saturday night, after the game
with Georgia Tech, the Atlanta chapter
of Davidson alumni tendered the mem-
bers of the “Little Red Machine” a
banquet at the Georgian ‘Terrace. At
7:30 a five-course dinner was served,
during which several speeches were
made by alumni. After the conclusion
of the dinner, Mr. H. L. Caldwell, pres-
ident of the Atlanta Association, in a
few well chosen words complimented
the team on its work in the game and
expressed the hope that this game may
become an annual event in Atlanta.

In behalf of the team and the college.
Coach Fetzer replied, thanking the as-
sociation for their hospitality and speak-
ing of the faithfulness of the team and
Student Body in the work of producing
the team which was representing the
college. Captain White was the next
speaker, expressing the wish that the At-
lanta alumni could have been present at
the A. & M. game. These were fol-
lowed by short speeches from Sayad
Black and Keesler. Sayad's accounts of
the Persians who have attended David-
son opened a pleasant period of discus-
sion of these men who were remembered
by many of the alumni present at the
banquet. Another enjoyable sneech of
the evening was made by Prof. Wm. G.
Perry, of Tech. who is a Davidson man
class of ’98. He was followed by O. J.
Huie. ‘or, who while in college was one
of our football stars. At a quarter of
nine the meeting was concluded.

The following with reference to the
work of A. M. McKeithen, ‘16, who is
now at Johns Hopkins and who ha:
made a place on the cleven of that uni-
versity, will be of interest:

“With Leadbetter in togs, and a week
more of training: for both Micklewaite
and McKeithen, who played on Satur-
dav with only a few davs of work. the
Hopkins line looks good on paper, and
certainly much stronger than the one
which appeared at Homewood against
the Emmerctsburg team. With this trio
of experienced men together. and
Schmidt to fill the guard and tackle po-
sitions. and Funk and Gorman on the
ends, the future looks much brighter.”

Two other Davidson men who are
now at Hopkins are Wm. Hollister, '16
and J. R. (“Big”) Dunn. ‘1s, both of
whom are in the medical department.
Hollister’s address is 1028 North Broad-
way, Baltimore, Md.

A RECENT LETTER FROM MR. PARKER.

The following are extracts from a let-
ter received a few davs ago from Rev.
W. P. Parker, of Mokpo, Korea. Mr.
Parker is of the class of ‘11, and the
Student Body for the last few years has
been contributing to the support of his
work:

Mokpo, Korea, Sept. 13. 1916.
Dear Davidson Boys:

Te is fall again, and we are having
some cooler weather just now, tho the
hot weather may not be altogether over.
We hope it is, and we hope the rain is
over with, too, but we have had so much
even very lately that we cannot be ex-
pected to be over-optimistic about it.
Heavy downpours washed part of the
railroad track away again, and we have
not had communication bv rail with
Seoul for several days. They say the
trains will all run today, however.

The Boys’ School opened August 25.

and we are much encouraged with the

prospect of a goud year, except for the

financial end, which we are trusting to
our Heavenly Father, of course doing all
in our power besides. Some problems have
come up in that direction now as you
may know, and we need your prayers
very especially that the work may not
suffer for lack of funds. ‘he boys fram
the country are coming in well; we al-
ready have seventeen dormitory boys,
and more are to come in very soon; we
would have two or three times as many
if we could only get work for them and
accommodate then with sleeping space.

‘The Girls’ School opened today with
an enrollment of fifty-two, and four
more wanted to enter, but Mrs. Nishet
was undecided whether to take them.
The rains kept two of the, teachers from
getting back on time, bur they ought to
be all in tonight. While Mrs. Nisbet
was at home she received a very unex-
pected gift of $t.o00 for extra dormi-
tory building, and this will soon be fin-
ished now, when twice the number of
girls now in can be accommodated. We
are all mighty proud of the work our
Girls’ School is doing. and of what it
has meant to so many girls from all over
the Mokpo territory, and thru them to
the villages in which they live; for if a
virl is brought in from a heathen village
and trained, she goes hack and teaches
and brings Christ home to her own fan-
ily and to others whom she can reach;
and it means a great deal for believers
to be able to train their girls as well as
their boys, and give them opportunities
thar the women in this land have not
known, Bovs can get to school much
easier than girls, naturally, and — the
Tapanese are doing more towards train-
ing the former (tho not. of course, Chris-
tian training, which we trv to give in
our schools), so that we feel that dur
greatest school work is that for the girls.

Don't forget to remember the Korean
work and missionaries in your prayers.
How richly our Heavenly Father — is
blessing us here in this lind. What a
glorious privilege it is to have however
small a part in His work.

With every sincerest best wish from
all of us.

As ever, Cordially vours,

Wm. P. Parker.
