Kelton, MacCormae Clash
In Behaviorism Symposium

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Asst. Managing Editor
Davidson professors Dr.

John 'D. Kelton and Dr. Earl

MacCormac met head-on

Wednesday night in the first

session of the Psychology

Club's symposium on ‘'Be-

haviorism/and Man.”

Dr. (Maynard ‘Rich of: Ca-
tawba Cotlege began the ses-
sion by presenting the his-
tory of behaviorism and its
philosophical bases in the
works of Plato, Aristotle,
and Piavlov, among many
others.

Senior Hugh Marr then pre-
sented ‘Kelton, iaind tthe verb-
al battle began with the psy-
chology professor's presenta-
tion of ‘the . pro-behaviorist
viewpoint.

Kelton explained@that there
wore many variations among
the behaviorists, but that J.
B. Watson and 'B. F. Skinner
drew the baittlelines most
distinetly, so he used their
definitions tand arguments.

Waitson, in hiis 1930 book on
the topic, defined ‘‘behavior-
ism" as ‘‘an ‘attempt to ap-

. . -' 100 girls

Council (RHC) receives .ad-
ministrative approval.

“We could have 100 girls
on campus within a year, and
it would be a great boost for
coeducation in the short run,”
said RHC President Bill
Alexander. He added that
the dorm has a capacity of
78 beds.

In a meeting Thursday
night the RHC considered a
number of other proposals.
One' was the Married Stu-
dent Housing Report, pre-
pared by representative Re-
ginald Barton.

: alganider said, ‘‘The pro-
posal” will go to the student
Senate, for approval, | recom-
mending: that the college pro-
vide ialternatives to the card-
board: village’. 8

presently consists of four

white houses close to the
tracks. on Griffith Road.

Alexander added, ‘We
think that the college has
an obligation to married stu-
dents just as it does to other
students. They have been. is-
olated and overlooked, and
the college should try to
make them feel a part of
this campus.”

A proposal on student re
frigeratgrs in the dorms re-
ceived final approval from
the ‘administration and will
go into effect next fall.

A suggested size of up to
six cubic feet will be used as
a standard, and any refrig-
erator over these specifica-

tions must be checked for

wiring.

Each refrigerator will be
the responsibility of one stu-
dent, who must register it,
clean. it before each break,
and move it‘out during’ the
summer months.

Another proposal before
the RHC is to set up allow-
ances for each dorm next
vear, which will be used by
a committee in the dorm for
parties.

“It will of course be limit-
ed to the finances in our bud-
get next year, ‘said Alex-
ander, ‘‘but we’re thinking
about it anyway.”

Responding to questions

“about the leaflet circulated

in the dorms by the Ad Hoc
Committee for an Alterna-
tive, Alexander said that he
had no_part in the thing.

“The RHC thiad nothing to
do with that thing about

_quiet dorms. Scotty Nicholls

was the vad hoc committee
herself.’’

The leaflet asked students

if they would prefer to live ,

in a dormitory with regulat-
ed study hours, a_ limited
open dorm policy, or one
with students majoring in a
foreign language.

“For the most part I think
it is ridiculous,” Alexander
said. ‘‘It’s like having a prep
school instaed of a college.
It assumes that students are
not responsible.”

The leaflets received only
nominal response, however,
and Alexander said that
many of those who answered
it decorated the paper with

_ obscenities.

ply to ithe experimenial study
of man the same kind of
procedures and experiments
used in the study of the be-
havior of lower animals.”
Watson tried to make behav
viorism a matural science,
placing it close to physiol-
ogy.

Skinner, on the other hand,
puts behaviorism in a cate-
gory closer to biology in his
more recent book, ‘‘Walden
Two."’ He contends that psy-
chology is the seience of be-
havior mather than the study
of mental life.

Kelton then listed essential
characteristics of behavior-
ism ‘as an insistence on ob-
jectivity; ‘a conviction that
behavior is lawful; and an
acceptance of physical mon-
ism, with a rejection of any
dualism of mind ‘and matter.

Other characterictics of
behaviorism are a rejection
of ‘‘mentalistic explanatory
fiction’; a search for vari-
ables outside imaginary
events; and sa willingness to
analyze behavior as the to-
tal of simpler components.

To prepare the audience of
about / 30 for the opposing
viewpoints of MacCormac,
Kelton presented some of the
objections which have been
raised agiainst behaviorism
in recent years, calling them
“either good defenses or good
targets.”

MacCormac, a _ philosophy
associate professor with an
interest in language acqui-
sition, then presented the
“‘antibehavioristic’’ view-
point, placing his major em-
phasis on wan ‘atiback of Skiin-
ner’s S/R. (stimulus re-
sponse) lassociatiion.”

He used a blackboard ‘and
mathematcal equations to
disprove the possibility of
S.R. association. According
to him, the basic difference
between his and Kellton’s
opinions was in their answer
to ithe question, ‘Do ‘all vari-
ables have to be observed or
not?”’

Following a break for cof-
fee ‘and doughnuts, a panel

consisting of Rich and Da-~

vidson students Bill Watson

and Robert Folger discussed
the varying viewpoints.

Rich then presented a syn-
thesis of the opinions ex-
pressed, and fielded ques-
tions from the audience.

The second half of the
symposium was held Thurs
day night.

- Galbraith

” ieeennlntee from Page 3)
stated, ‘‘Without exception
every reason for Vietnam in-
tervention has now been dis-
solved.”

He said that the U.S. has
no vital interests there, now
knows that the war is not
part of a communist probe,
and recognizes that demo-
cracy is,not being preserved.

Galbraith concluded his ©
talk with a few suggested
remedies. ‘‘We have stum-
bled into ithe third world. We
must contnact our policy in
Latin America, Afnica, and
Asia, and quit making dis-
tinctions between govern-
ments which iare good and

bad.’ .

He said that he ‘supports
the continuation of a foreign
aid program, but one which
is more in the line of what
the Peace Corps is doing to-
day. He ‘added that the U.S.
must recognize tnade with all
governments.

“It will take time to liqui-
date the disaster in Vietnam.
Our influence, however, lies
in the iabsence of levers of
power.”
