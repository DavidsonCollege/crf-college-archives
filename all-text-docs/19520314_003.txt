As you can tell from the Interfraternity All-Stars, the men
competing in the program were of a high calibre. Two of the
men were on the varsity squad last year and one of the others,
Bill Bivins, poured in a phenomenal number of baskets for the
Phi Delts. He got hot toward the end of the season and really
went to town.

The interfraternity
basketball program end-
ed last week and was
one of the most success-
ful, and contained some
of the best basketball
in recent years. Seems
like the scoring was bet-
ter as some of the teams
“poured it on’ under
the baskets and racked
in a lot of points for in-
terfrat ball. The general
play was noticeably bet-
ter and faster and the
individual stars were
plentiful by the end
of the season.

FROSH BAG TWO SPOTS

°

Somewhat as the big-brother league—the Southern

Conference—freshman stars were plentiful and left their
marks on the record books. This is probably the first year
that two frosh as outstanding as Corky Clark and Frank
Smith have matle the “dream team.” Corky polled the max-
imum number of votes and so along with Bivins won the

co-captain honors.

Interest remained high in interfraternity athletics and it is
hoped that the volleyball and later sports will command as
much attention as the basketball season and the track meet com-

manded as the year waxes on.

NOW THAT SPRING’S HERE

As soon as the last snow was melted away by the warm
sunshine and cool breezes, we came to realize that winter was
all over and that before you knew it, Spring would be upon us.
Along with Spring, just as with ham and eggs, comes baseball,
and in our lucky case, golf, track, and tennis.

Almost as soon as the robins appeared, it became evi-
dent that this could be the best Spring for Davidson in
many years. What with the tennis team (between snow,
rain, and broom-straw) working out and looking all the
better, ‘the baseballers getting off to an early start with
their new coach, the golf team stacking up as the best in
years, and the track team ready to hold their own in a
gruelling six-meet schedule; it indeed does seem like a bright

year ahead.

TENNIS AND GOLF GRAB SPORTLIGHT

The tennis and golf teams, strictly from an early cbserva- |
tion, look like cinches to cop real honors amongst their oppo-
nents this Spring. The tennis team has a better-balanced bunch,
and have been strengthened greatly by three freshman stars. The
importance of these men can be seen from the positions they

copped.

The golf team while losing Monty Hill, the No. 1 man,
and Cecil Brandon, seems to be better-balanced also and if men
like Mac McLean, Al Fitzgerald, Slimy Sloan and Al Gaither
come through with the golf they are capable of, the conference

can watch ont.

BASEBALL, TRACK HAVE HARD ROW

The baseball team is taking on a new coach and losing
two of their best sluggers and only pitcher from last year,
faces the hardest task. They have a hustling bunch, how-
ever, and the competition is keen. If the pitching can be
worked out, and the men get on the paths, the record in
May just might be better than expected.

Track will have to depend on Bill White, Jim Fickeisen,
Bob Henry, Bill Shipley, Bill McNeely, and Gene Pierce to carry
the thinclads to victories. Again the balance is better and the’com-
petition, great. Frosh should help out, too.

Wildcats Of The Week

Probably the greatest comeback
and the greatest success story here
at Davidson lately comes not from
an individual player, but from a
whole team. This team started a
rather winless year after Christ-
mas by defeating a strong Emory
team and falling to a stronger Tar
Heel team. Then the winter months
came long and hard for the wrest-
ling team and they dropped four or
five straight matches.

Then deciding that this thing was
all wrong, the grapplers traveled
to Lexington, Va., and defeated the
usually-invincible Generals. It was
a strictly team victory and it was
sheer fight and guts that pushed
the groaners to the win that was
the greatest one on Davidson's
books since the N. C, State football
defeat of 1949.

The streak continued and the
boys not to be outdone entered the
AAU meet and came out, not on
top, but with a good record of wins
and some second and third places.

Then in the Southern Conference
meet last week, the Cats pulled
something that they haven’t been
able to do in the past decade. They
placed in the standings when the
final match was over! Not only
that, but they were only one point
out of second place, copping 15
markers to West Virginia's 16.
Maryland easily slipped into first
place with 41 points having by far

the strongest aggregation there.
You say that that’s really nothing,
but when has a Davidson team
come out this well in ANY South-
ern Conference tournament?

Gene Craven continued his mas-
tery of the 130-Ib. class, but as has
been the case in the past, just didn’t
have the luck and experience be-
hind him in taking a second-place
behind Champ Jim Flynn of Mary-
land. Billy McNeely also added a
second-place, dropping the cham-
pionship match to big Bill George
of Wake Forest.

Morley Vail surprised everyone
at the conference meet except the
local team with a third-place in the
137.1b. class. Besides that, he won
the consolation bracket, proving
that only the champs could beat
him.

As was stated before, this is
strictly a. great success story. It
rests in the books now, but you can
bet your bottom you-know-what
that this team will be hard to handle
next year as they only lose one
man. This man has big shoes to
fill, for he has filled them better
than anyone else in the past few
years; Bill McNeely will be missed,

but these young grapplers will be
a better balanced group and will
have the experience that goes with
a third-place winner in the South-
ern Conference.

OLYMPIC TRYOUTS IN FULL SWING

Ten Cat Matmen
In Tournament

By DICK ROPER

The Southeastern Olympic Wrestling tryouts got off to a
fast start this afternoon in Johnston Gym with some of the best
grapplers in this section of the nation participating. The prelim-
inary bouts held this afternoon were the first of four sessions on
the mats, with finals climaxing the 2-day event tomorrow night.

Open With
Springfield On

The Wildcat baseball squad
opens its seventeen-game schedule
Monday and Tuesday against
Springfield College on the home
diamond.

This year’s Davidson team
probably will not be a great
hitting team, but it definitely
will be running on the base
paths and hustling at the plate
and in the field,

As the situation now stands no
definite line-up has been decided
upon. However, after the past few
weeks of practice, the number of
men battling for certain positions
has narrowed down.

Arnold Whisnant, Hershall
Allan, and Diehl Sluss are
fighting for the firstbase posi-
tion. Johnny Gray is at second
with Johnny Guiton as utility.
Chuck Elliott is back at short-
stop. Max Devane and Bill
Southwell are at third base.
There are many good prospects

in the outfield and six or seven of
them will be carried on the squad.

A number of pitchers have shown
considerable promise thus far in
practice and will be kept on the
squad. These include Andy Courts,
Lyndley Beardsley, Jim Smith,
Johnny Smith, and Ish Bennett,
From these players a well-balanced
staff should be formed. At the
present time letterman Paul East-
man has been handicapped by a
sore arm, but has still shown up
well ‘on the mound,

Four players are battling for the
catching post. These are Bert
Downs, Bill Glidewell, Roy White
and Shorty Sfaelos. Because. of his
experience, Downs should hold
down the first-string backstopping
position,

For Big Opener

By MOODY SMITH

Anxious to improve on their very
acceptable 1951 record of 12 wins
and 7 defeats, the Davidson nets-
men open their season on the local
courts with a match Tuesday with
Springfield College.

The tennis team, which has been
practicing steadily since the first of
March whenever weather permitted,
looks like a surefire winning entry
in intercollegiate competition. Led
by Allan Strand in the number one
singles berth, the team at present
lines up like this for singles com-
petition: Strand, first; then in the
second spot, Lacy Keesler; he is
followed by his brother and team
captain, Dewey Keesler. Then
come Johnny Bremer, Corky
Clark and Leighton Green in that
order. By match time, however,
this set-up may be shuffled con-
siderably, because challenge
matches are being played constant-
ly, scarcely a day going by that
someone does not move up or down
on the “ladder.”

These singles players are all
of surprisingly equal ability, with
not a world of difference between
any two of them, a fact which
could be an ill omen for all op-
ponents, \

Except for the number one
slot, the doubles teams are as
yet uncertain. Strand and

Dewey Keesler will lead the

doubles parade for the Wild-

cats just as they did last sea-
son. Various combinations, in-
cluding Johnny Bremer, Corky

Clark, Lacy Keesler, Leighton

Green, Joe Dudley, Bill Bivens,

and George Snead are being ex-

perimented with for the other
two doubles teams, with there
being a definite probability
that the number two combina-
tion will consist of Clark and
Lacy Keesler.

. At present the team includes
about 18 players. It is interesting
to note that in this one sport in
which a Davidson team has depth,
it is littte needed, There are more

Shown above are the winners of the sports managers’ poll for
the best players in the interfraternity league. They are, left to right:
Frank Smith, George King, Corky Clark, Bill Bivins and “Lefty”

Vance.

A's PLACE TWO MEN ON TEAM;

CLARK, BIVINS ARE CO-CAPTS.

By WALLACE ABBOTT

The best in the league! Yes, that’s
what can be said about Corky
Clark, “Lefty” Vance, Bill Bivins,
George King and Frank Smith, be-
cause they comprise this year's first
All-Fraternity Basketball team, as
chosen by the fraternity sports
managers. This group represents
variety, not only in their individual
abilities, but also in the groups they
represent, since there are members
of four fraternities on the first team.
Only the KA's were able to place
more than one man,

CORKY CLARK .

Corky proved to be one of the
best new-comers into the league in
many years. Not only did he help
lead the Kappa Sigs to the cham-
pionship by his scoring ability, but
he also worked well under the back-
boards as he got rebound after re-
bound. Corky is a freshman this
year and a member of Kappa Sig-
ma, He was a hard man to stop
this year and will be even harder
to stop in future years.

LEFTY VANCE

Lefty is one of the two KA’s
to make the team this year, and
he is certainly deserving of the
honor. Not only did he prove
to be a good team man, but he
also came through as one of the
league’s high scorers. His fine
jump shots from the foul circle
made him constantly dangerous
all year. |

BILL BIVINS

Although getting off to a slow
start in this year’s play, Bill proved
in the last games of the season that
he still had the stuff that made
him one of last year’s best players.
Bill is a member of Phi Delta
Theta and is another one of those

juniors who will be back to haunt
the courts next year. Bill's out-
standing. value to his team came
largely from his ability to hit set
shots from any place on the court.

GEORGE KING

George is the sccona KA who
made this year's team, and he cer.
tainly proved his worth to them in
his first year of intramural basket-
ball. George, as you know, was a
member of last year's varsity bas-
ketball squad. The experience he
gained last year stood him in good
stead, as he turned up as one of
the leading point producers in the
league,

FRANK SMITH

Frank, now a member of Sigma
Chi, certainly proved his worth to
the Campus Club in the time he
played for them. Being only a
freshman was no obstacle to Frank
as he broke strongly into this year’s
intramural play. He is another one
of those new-comers who will cer-
tainly have to be watched in com-
ing years,

Second Team

Eric Clark (Kappa Sig).
Larry Champion (Phi Gam).
Tyler Berry (Sigma Chi)

Theo Field (Pika).

Golfers Head For F lorida;
Meet Miami, Rollins, Et Al

By BOB

Coach Elgin White’s untested
Davidson golf team will pack their
clubs and depart from Presbyterian
Hollow on Thursday, March 20, on
a golfing tour that will pit the
Wildcats against some of Florida's
toughest college teams.

On the successive afternoons of
March 24, 25, and 26 the Cat
linksters will face the Univ of
Miami, at Miami; Rollins, at Win-
ter Park; and the Univ. of Flori-
da, at Gainesville. Hampered by
frequent wet weather and the fact
that McLean, Fitzgerald and Keith
only recently concluded their bas-
ketball chores, the golfers have
found it very difficult to get the
desired amount of practice.

Last year the Davidson golfers
found the Florida opposition to
their liking, and the experience
gained in these early matches
did much to prepare them for
the Southern Conference
matches later in the season.
FSU and Charleston Navy fell
before the DC golfers while

OWENS

Rollins and the Univ. of Flori-
da managed to squeeze by
them on a couple of their “off”
days. Considering the unseen
and hazardous courses on which
these matches were played, this
record wag quite commendable.
So they are out to do it again, and
ready to “tee off’ will be six boys
from the same eight-man crew
that blistered the Florida opposi-
tion last year. Led by Captain Mac
McLean, the Cats are bolstered
by lettermen Jimmy Sloan, Al
Gaither, Al Fitzgerald, Lew Barnes
and Lawrence Erwin. Bob Brannan
and Graham Keith, up from the
frosh ranks of last year, are strong
contenders to fill the shoes of
Monty Hill and Cecil Brandon,
the only golfers not returning from
last year’s squad. None of these
boys are certain of holding their
position on the team, however, and
before the close of the season many
new names may be introduced into
the Wildcat line-up.

Track Trophy

By JOHN HANDLEY

The Phi Delts retained posses.
sion of the coveted track trophy in
interfraternity circles yesterday in
capturing five of a possible cleven
first spots in the annual meet and
Frank
Mitchener, a freshman,was the Man
of the Hour in capturing top in-
dividual honors for his Phi Delts
with a grand total of 11% foints.
There were plenty of entrants and
some good races, but-not a single
record time or distance was turned
in.

Mitchener broke the tape three
times in winning the 100-yd.
dash, the 220-yd. run, and in
holding the anchor spot on the
winning Phi Delt relay team.
Other high scorers were Frank
Cenegy of the Pi Kapps with
10%, and Gene Pierce of the
Phi Gams with 10.

The Phi Delts were followed by
the Phi Gams with 15 points; the
KA's—I4 1-3; and the Pi Kapps—
13.

The winners of the events were:

Shot—Cenegy °(42'4") Pi Kanps;

100-yd. dash—Mitchener = (10.35)

mildness is by steady smoking. That's the true

It’s the sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel
