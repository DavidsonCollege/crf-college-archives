Cornel West calls for hope at Spirit Square

By TieseE C.M. Manico
Guest Writer

Dr. Cornel West of Harvard
University, author of Race Mat-
ters and co-author with Henry
Louis Gates, Jr. of The Future of
the Race, addressed a very anxious
audience in the auditorium of
Charlotte’s Spirit Square on Thurs-
day at 8 p.m. West spoke as part of
The Henrietta Marie Project, bring-
ing the slave ship exhibition to a
climactic and motivating closure.

West said that everyone had
gathered there in response to a
“human problem,” as the slave ship
was something deeply American;
not simply black history, but some-
thing that constituted the core of
American history. He went on to
describe America as a “hotel civi-
lization” where this human cause
has been lost, as comfort is the
greatest preoccupation. “We want
to be sentimental to the race prob-

that it is very hard to “raise the
problem of evil” in hotel civiliza-
tion, because there is a vast fear of
alienation. Raising the problem of
evil means raising the problem of
subordination and degradation (not
forgetting homophobia) which
have long been instruments of
white supremacy. And why such
harsh and alienating terms?’ “You
got to speak the truth. That’s what
the slave ship is all about,” said
West.

West asked his audience,
“How does it feel to be a problem
in a hotel civilization that claims to
be in the problem solving busi-
ness?’ He explained that America
is known for her pragmatism and
problem solving capacity and that
at every year at the State of the
Union address and every four years
at the inauguration it is proclaimed
that Americahas noproblem. “Yet,
these people's [African Americans]
presence constitutes a problem
from the vantage point of the pow-

ers that be.”

West discussed the term “wel-
fare queen,” the catchphrase which
has become synonomous with
“black woman” in America. West
contended that it was no accident
that President Clinton signed his
new welfare act with a “sister”
behind him. In spite of the progress
black women have made, he said,
“they are a symbol of laziness in
America... and things just move on
as usual.”

On the subject of Ebonics, Dr.

West called the argument in favor

of it “intellectually vacuous,
empty.” He explained, “These kids
hardly have text books. We need
more resources. This is not the
first time an intellectually vacuous
argument has been heard. I hear
them all the time on Wall Street
and in the White House and some
are good and some are bad, some
are persuasive and some are not.
But, you always want to keep track
of what’s the motivation, the cir-

cumstance, the situation. That’ s
the challenge.”

So how do you solve the prob-
lem of evil in a hotel civilization?
West concluded his discourse by
urging his audience to have hope.
“We need hope, rich hope, sus-
tained hope. But not optimism. I
find it very difficult to be optimis-
tic. It strikes me as too sentimen-
tal...

The best of the tradition
strugglers are those who are pris-
oners of hope. The prisoners of
hope are those who can look at the
evidence and see it is not enough...
that make a sense history conta-
gious and try to set other folks on
fire to cut against the grain and
make a sacrifice, that in fact is
what hope is all about. It’s what
the spirituals are all about, it is
what the blues are all about. To
look at an overwhelming situation,
to never give in to defeat, but know
that you are still catching hell... to
keep on keeping on.”
