Great Issues Will Offer
Forum Of Foreign Affairs

The Great Issues Committee will sponsor a Grea
sometime in April. The program will consist of spe

discuss topics relating to foreign affairs,

The purpose of the Great Is-
sues Committee, which is made
up of representatives from the
YMCA, the Student Union, the
Business Economics Club, and
the IRC, is to pool the resources
of these organizations in order
to present one broad, informa-
tive program instead of several
smalier less-effective ones.

The faculty chairman of this
committee is Dr. Paul Marrotte
of the history department. Mr.
C. Shaw Smith, who is working
closely with the committee, an-
nounced that a student chair-
man would be selected at a
later date. He further said that
the series was to be “as student
centered as possible.”

The committee met Monday
night to select a speaker for the
series. Plans, however, are still

in the early stages, and it has
not been decided whether there
will be only one speaker giving
several talks or various speak-
ers making only one appearance
each. The length of the pro-
gram will depend on the type
of speakers. The theme, other
than the general heading of
foreign affairs, has not been
selected yet.

This Great Issues series has
been met with great enthusiasm
by outside organizations and
the college administration. The
Great Issues Committee was in-
vited last Monday to WSOC-TV
to be guests for dinner and dis-
cussion of this program with
Joseph C. Harsch, senior NBC
news commentator.

Also working with the com-
mittee is Dr. Harold Ford of

The college administration,
which has been impressed by

two earlier series on political)

Speaking for the committee, Mr.

budget is still small, we are|*

most encouraged at the admini-
stration’s view of the series and

John Stone and Mr. Smith
have recently returned with
fresh ideas from the Student
Conference on National Affairs
(SCONA) at Texas A&M, and
they should be able to contri-

Reveals Alcoholic Past

BY LEONARD RICHARDSON
Davidsonian Feature Writer

What happened in Elm Row? Since last week when the small brick building was

moved approximately one

have been made at the original site. At least six
been combing through the mud and hand-chisele

Bottles are the main artifacts
unearthed—wine bottles, beer
and ale bottles, whiskey bottles,
and even a Bromo-Seltzer bottle.
Dr. Chalmers Davidson has
found three old bottles on
which he refused to comment
until he can get some informa-
tion about their age and value
from the libraries of the cities
in which they were made. An-
other professor discovered .a
bottle marked 1837, the year in
which Elm Row was first used
as a dormitory.

A junior has unearthed two
ale bottles of amber glass and
a glass flask with a bit of leath-
er-like orange peel rattling in
the bottom. Dr. Donald Plott
found several long-necked
handblown tinted glass bottles,
all undated.

A controversial discovery is
the half-decayed remains of a
girl’s shoe. Less challenging but
still of interest are a fragmen-
tary 1895 Southern Railway
timetable, the jawbone of a rat,
and many pieces of broken
dishes.

The four-roomed Elm Row
was one of four dormitories
opened to sixty-five students
in 1837. Of the four, only two
survive. Originally four men

occupied each room and were
required to keep their rooms
clean and in good order—e
rule enforced by faculty in-
spections. In the 1840's a list
of faculty regulations made it
their duty “To frequently
visit rooms and observe their
conditions at any hour of the
day or night.”

A professor seeking admis-
sion had the right to force en-
trance. If damage to the door
resulted it was charged to the
student refusing entrance. This
police system of the faculty was
distasteful to the students, but
it lasted for a long time. Dr.
Davidson has suggested that in
those days students cleverly
pulled up a board and dumped
the bottles under the floor
when warned of a faculty raid.

Between 1845 and 1849 ten or
more students were suspended
for intoxication — two being
guilty during Commencement
in 1847 and adding to their sin
by cursing one Professor Wil-
son. In 1845 Major D. H. Hill
explained his plan to publish
the grades of the students in
the catalogue of the college.
“But for the great mass of stu-
dents there is no stimulus at all
and unless fortified with high

religious principle, most speed-
ily acquire idle habits and learn
to drone away their time be-
tween lounging, cards, cigars,
and whiskey punch.”

When Elm Row is situated
across from Oak Row, it will be
in the approximate position
earlier occupied by Tammany,
a similar brick structure which
was torn down in 1901 and in-
corporated in Shearer Hall,
then being erected. The move
to its new position was executed
to make room for the new Fine
Arts Building.

It has been rumored that
in the Civil War years a stu-
dent who hurriedly left col-
lege carefully hid a bag filled
with coins under the floor of
Elm Row, his dormitory, hop-
ing to recover it when he re-.
turned from the War. The
story goes that he discreetly
mentioned the treasure in his
diary which has since been
lost. Since the student was
killed in battle, he never re-
turned to recover his money.

Although one professor who
heard the story was skeptical
because of the lack of proof, he
agreed that there is a chance

Announce Aid Grants

On Christmas Eve, the Atomic Energy Commission
announced a $5000 gift to Davidson, which is to be used
for offering instruction in the use of radioisotopes.

Davidson was one of six colleges to receive the
money, with which radioisotopes will be purchased from
AEC. The program of instruction will be headed b
Physics professor John I. Hopkins, formerly of the staff
at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

The AEC-sponsored gift program is now in its third
year, and is given with the understanding that all the
cash will be spent within the year.

Davidson College has again been selected as one of
the privately financed United States colleges and uni-
versities to receive unrestricted grants-in-aid under the
aid-to- education program of Texaco Inc., it was an-
nounced this week by President D. Grier Martin. Al-
though the grant of $1,500 is unrestricted as to use, it
will strengthen Davidson's current faculty salary budget,
Martin said.

Davidson is one of more than 200 colleges and uni-
versities included in Texaco’s program of educational
support. In addition to providing for direct financial as-
sistance to 140 privately financed schools, the program
includes scholarship and fellowship assistance for ap-
proximately 300 young men at more than 80 educational
institutions, both private and tax supported.

The Shell Companies Foundation, Incorporated, has
donated $1,500 to Davidson, the third such donation}
since 1958, when the Shell Assists program was estab-|
lished.

The donation consists of three $500 grants, one for
development of academic facilities, a grant for develop-
ment of departmental facilities, and a $500 free fund.

The grant for academic development, supervised by
Dean Johnston, is designed to encourage ‘additional
professional development of the individual members of
any of the school’s faculties.”

The Physics department will receive the second
$500 grant, which is intended ‘for additional professional
development of individual faculty members.”

The Shell Assist is intended to be used to encourage
additional scholarly activities for the faculty, such as
attendance at professional meetings, personal research,
travel, and “the general well-being of faculties in a
contemplative atmosphere.”

ord dealers, and record fans.
Joni has made many top re-

there were riots in virtually
every country when the supply

to discern how we as Christian
students could relate our faith
to these perplexing problems.
What we learned was ‘not pleas-
