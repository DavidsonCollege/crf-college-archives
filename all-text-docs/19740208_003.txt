Rudolph Aesthetics Strain Finances

By BRUCE CORSER
Managing Editor
This fall, Paul Rudolph was
Y approved as
the architect for Davidson’s
proposed future housing.

The New York-based ar-
chitect was selected by the
Committee on Future Campus
Housing on the basis of plans
submitted by over 23 ap-
plicants. President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. noted that
Rudolph was unquestionably
the most eminent of the people
considered.

Dean of Students Will Terry,
who was also chairman of the
committee said that ‘‘the
main reason we chose Mr.
Rudolph was the interest and
sensitivity he displayed to
what he wanted.”’

The original floor plan
called for ‘‘a series of apart-
ments, actually a series of
living clusters, ‘vili  <it-
chenettes, designed ror casual
living,’’ according to Rudolph.

During the _ selection
process, Spencer indicated
that the committee knew that
a Rudolph designed structure
would be more expensive than
a conventional dormitory.

What the committee learned

later was that construction of

the Rudolph housing would
cost an estimated $2.5 million.

After learning of the
magnitude of projected cost,
Davidson administrators
asked Rudolph to submit a
more economical version of
the same plan. According to
Terry, the second drawing
was ‘very fine.’’ However,
with an estimated 84 percent
interest rate, the room fees
would still equal at least $1400
annually per student - in urder
to provide for the repayment
of interst, principle, and an-
nual operating costs.

Due to the exorbitant ex-.

pense of the Rudolph apart-
ments Davidson is now ex-
ploring different avenues of
financing student housing.
One administration scheme
would encourage private con-
struction of townhouses on the
perimeter or close to the cam-
pus to alleviate the strain on
the dormitories.

“The townhuse concept
would guarantee enough
housing to move ahead with
the Trustee’s coeducation plan
on schedule,”’ Spencer ob-
served.

which have not been approved
by the trustees.

The governance committee
is attempting to draft a college
constitution which will in-
corporate all of these con-
stituiencies. Within the con-
fines of this document, the
students and faculty would
then write their own by-laws.

Manager Robert A. Currie is
working with three different
developers on the townhouse
proposal. Final estimates
should be ready by Feb. 15.

As for the financing of the
Rudolph building, Spencer
declared, ‘‘I don’t want to
divert capital to income-

““We need to divert money to
projects that don’t produce
capital such as new
chemistry, biology, or fine ar-
ts facilities. We have a num-
ber of needs down the road,’
he added.

Asked about the possibility
of a capital drive to financethe
Rudolph housing, Vice
president of Finance and
Development, C. David Cor-
nell said, ‘‘We’ve just come
out of a big capital campaign
and we usually wait eight to
ten years between them. We
don’t want to run ourselves in-
to the ground.

“We could have tried to ap-
proach certain donors to give
money for a Rudolph dor-
mitory, however, the
President chose not to go this
route. I support him in this
decision.”

Terry, upon being asked
about the “robability of the
future construction of the
Rudolph housing said,

at this point in construction.

Johnson told Spencer that
the Aug. 1 deadline may have
to be extended longer if the
trucker’s strike is not resolved
in the immediate future.

“If we are delayed any fur-
ther,”’ said Spencer, ‘‘we will
try to work out = an
arrangement whereby we can
begin moving the library as
soon as the contractor finishes
the building. We have told the
contractors, however, that we
must be moved in when school
starts in the fall.

However, Terry also em-
phasized that the construction
of townhouses would be a
clearer death-knell for the
Rudolph building. ‘‘A new dor-

mitory,” he continued, ‘‘is
something that will happen in
another generation of studen-
ts.”’

They would provide the stu-
dents with a greater number of
options from which to

The President remarked
that he would not like to see
another ‘‘barracks-type’’
built.

In any event, Davidson ad-
ministrators will have to come
up with some _ concrete
proposals for the Trustee’s

said.

At last October’s meeting,
