Series Of Lectures

Beginning Monday evening, March

on the topic,
through Wednesday wight and

“Sex and Marriage”’

The lectures wilt aun
each of them wilt be at cight

will open the series with a
talk on “The Physioiogy of Sex,”

First Presbyterian Church in Ghar-

done a great.deal of work_in_the
field of psychology and is espe-
cially interested in this subject. The
series will close Wednesday eve-
ning with a talk by Dr, Carl
Pritchett, pastor of the College
Church, on “Looking Toward Mar-
riage.”

A. discussion will be held cach
night after the lectures, at which
time questions may be asked, either
by placing the question in a box
for that purpose or direct questions.
At this time the speaker of the
evening will try to clarify any point
that may not be clear in the stu-
dents’ .mind,

In. sponsoring this lecture series,
the YMCA is trying to fulfill a
need that. is prevalent in the world
today, that of education in “Sex
and Marriage.” One needs but to
look ‘at the broken homes, the di-
vorce courts and-the degradation of
the sexes to realize that there is.a
pressing need for education along
these lines. The increase! in im-
morality, and the tremendous in-
crease of sex crimes among the
young people of our time show
that they are not getting the proper
education along these lines and in
many cases proper education would
have alleviated the causes. Proper
sex education leads to-a more suc-
cessful life and increases the
chances for a happy marriage.

Everyone is invita to ‘attend
these lectures and to™articipate in

Oscar Wilde’s “Importance of
Being Ernest.” will be presented

by the Red and Black Masquers in
Chambers Auditorium on Monday
might, April 5. Plans and practices
are running smoothly, pointing to
a night of-real enjoyment.

The play takes place in London,
England, in June of 1947. ‘The

farce comedy, recently revived on
Broadway “by the Old Vice Reper-

The play calls for three different |

settings and these are of modern
design and quite in keéping with
Wilde's original settings.

production will be the part of the

Local- World
Federalists To
st Charter

The United “World Federalists’
group on the campus has secured
the approval of the school’s Execu-
tive .Committee, Dave Hamilton,
chairman of the petition commit-
tee, disclosed at a meeting last Fri-
day. Also a constitution was
adopted after changes were made
in the proposed constitution, which
was prepared by the constitution
committee, headed by
Owen.

A charter for the local group
has been applied, for, but it has
not been received. Recently nine
members of the group received
their national membership cards.
They are Malloy Owen, Dave
Hamilton, Bill Hamilton, Irving
Stubbs, Don Shriver, John Hobart,
R. J. King, Bob Gay and Frank
Perrin. Clyde Tandy and Jack
King were already members of the
national organization thus making
the total number of nationally regis-
tered members eleven. However,
there are more than this number
in the local group. :

A discussion of the selection
of an adviser and an honorary ad-
visory board took place at the meet-
ing, and the group decided in favor
of both as a part of its organiza-
tion. As yet there have been, no
selections to fill these positions, lout
a list of faculty members to bé con-
sidered in filling these posts were
made.

UWF will meet tonight at the
YMCA at 6:45 p.m. The program
is to include a brief report on the
organizational meeting of the N. C.
Student Division of the UWF by
Clyde Tandy and a short talk on
the need for world government by
John Hobart. A cordial invitation
is extended to all members of the
student, body who favor world gov-

ernment with limited powers ade-
quate to prevent war and who are
interested in Promoting this end.
This organization is open to ail
who agree to support its beliefs
and purposes. All interested stu-
dents please contact Frank Perrin
