Frosh Campus
Stops Dee. Ist.

Royster Will Tolerate No
More ‘Noxiousness’

On November. 11, the entire Fresh-

Class

campus by

man was placed on_ strict

the Court of Control.
The campusing is supposed to. end
December 1 but any infraction of
the class will result in a prolongation
of the sentence.

Judge Royster said that several
Freshmen have been caught_violat-
ing this ruling and states that they
will be severly punished but nothing
The entire Court
will decide on the punishment but
something severe ‘guaranteed.
Judge Royster states that he will
not tolerate any foolishness by the
Freshman’ Class and he promised
serious punishment to each violator.

Any sentence by the Court of
Control is subject to reviewal bythe
Student Council in order to protect
Freshman interests. To back the
Court of Control, any Freshman who
flagrantly violates Freshman Regu-
lations and Court sentences, is sub-
ject to the full discipline of the
Student Council. This means that
an habitual violator can be diss-
missed from school.

Major Checks
ROTC Here

During the middle of the’ past
month, an inspection of the school
led by Maj. A. D. Sanders was
highly successful. This inspection
was not the annual War Department

around

the 25. Soon after that our kick from
the goal line was partially blocked,
enabling a Barium line backer to
scoop it up and drive across for
their second score. The extra point
was good.

Davidson passed and ran the ball
deep into Barium territory and took
the lead again when Flowers drove
over from the 4. This time Coon-
rad’s kick was good.

Barium Springs scored their win-
ning touchdown in the third quarter
on an intercepted pass in the flats
which they ran over standing up.
They missed the extra point, which
was not vitally needed anyway.

Although Davidson tried desper-
ately to score in the closing minutes,
the attempt was futile and the game
ended 20 to 19 in favor of the scrap-
py eleven from Barium Springs.

WILDCATS DEFEATED | by Ashmore and ‘Flowers, the Red

(Continued from Page 3)
Ashmore’s aerial and hauled it back
to the 'Cat 20. Once again the
“thin red line” held the Bengals at
bay and Ashmore punted out of
danger. Late in the period Seay
broke through and blocked one
of Ashmore’s boots, and Chappell
fell on the ball on the Davidsén 20.
Russell, the ace Clemson flanker,
on an end around romped into the
end zone untouched. Freeman's
kick was wide and the visitors led
6-0 at the half.

Soon after the intermission the
Tigers scored again when Whitmire
scooted 41 yards on a_ reverse.
The extra point was-~blocked. The
Clemson forces, capatilizing on an-
other Wildcat miscue, scored again
a few plays later. With the ball
in the McEvermen’s possession on
their own 29, a bad pass from center
eluded the ‘Cat backs and Clemson
recovered on the 18. Rogers and
Trumpore smashed to the 1 where
the latter terminated the march by
crashing ‘into the end zone. Moon-
eyhan’s kick was good and the
Tigers held 19-0 margin at the end
of the third quarter.

Still another misque set up the
final tally. Simpson fell on Crane’s
fumble just inside the Davidson 20.
Despite a 15 yard penalty, Trumpore
chalked up the marker on a 19 yard
off tackle jaunt. Mooneyhan again
converted. Late in the final chapter,
the ’Cats uncorked the drive-which
resulted in the Wildcat score. Paced

and Black machine marched to the

Tiger 1 where Flowers hit the right

side of thé line for the touchdown.

Williams’ tonversion attempt struck ©
the crosgfar and bounded back onto

the field.

Trumore, Rogers, and Whitmire
were the outstanding performers for
the Bengals. Ashmore, Flowers,
and White led.,the ‘Cat ground-
gainers while Williams, Hay, and
Floyd played creditably in the for-
ward wall.

K. A.’s AND SIGS TIED
(Continued from Page 3)

Sigs 2-0. They rallied and closed
the season with victories over the
S.P. E.’s-and the Pikas.. Tom Abell
and Dick Baxter were the standout
performers in the big forward wall.

The Kappa Sigs, with a host of
speedy backs, used a tricky attack
to achieve their fine record. The
Sigmas opened the chase»with a
narftow 1-0 win over the S. P. E.’s.
In ‘their next appearance they were
soundly thumped by the Betas.
They came to life at that point and
copped their remaining games easily,
climaxing the spurt with a 54-0
triumph over the hopeless Pikas.

The other clubs tried desperately
to keep pace with the leaders but
they were unable to do so. The
Betas, led by Ellington, White and
Witherington, and the S. P. E.’s,
with Triplett, Owens and Bob Brad-
ford_as—their_stars, tied—for the
runner-up slot.

above all .

ted is, according to ‘Maj. E. E.
Marsh, PMS&T, the best the Col-
lege has ever received. It is truly
a report that the faculty and stu-
dents can take pride in. On every
detail Davidson was either Excel-
lent or Adequate, This—maintains
the high standing that Davidson
has enjoyed in, the past.
