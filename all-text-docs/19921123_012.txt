THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINION

Mandingo...Travis Hinson &
Rafael Candelario

BSC is Open to Anyone -

T-Yo Rafrod, I’m getting the hell
_ out of here! I just can’t take this
school any more!

R-Come on Rock! It can’t be that
bad, can it? I mean we’ve been
here 3 years.

T-Exactly! 3 long years and it’s
been the same crap every year.
The semester starts off good and
you think that things have become
better for black students here until
mid semester hits, and you find
that it’s the same isolated campus.
Not to mention there are already
two other black students leaving
next semester!

R-Damn! I guess you are right.
Since we’ve been here the number
of black students has decreased in
every freshman class. I remember
that there used to be eighty black
students, now there are only sixty!
What’s up?

T-I'll tell you what’s up! It’s a
conspiracy!! MR. CHARLIE is
trying’ to keep us (black folks)
down!!!

(MR. CHARLIE: the white estab-
lishmentthat has continuously held
black folks down in America.

R-Yo, calm down Rock! We have

attrition rate for black students is
horrible. Yes, the number of black

"I remember that there

students, now there are
only sixty!”

freshman entering in every class is
decreasing, but we all have to do
something about it.
T-You’reright. I guess I had better
get off my black ass and do some-
thing about it. The only way that
the number of black students will
increase at. Davidson college is if
the black students themselves get
involved with the process. No one
else can do it.

R-Maybe, I think white students
can get involved too. Right now I
think black students here get a bad

rap. A lot of white students are
scared to even look at us or even
come down to our house. Did the
freshman halls even get to look at
the BSC house during house pre-
sentations? If the majority of them
remain scared of us, it will be ob-
vious to black perspectives and
they won’tcome. It has to be a dual
process: student involvement in
recruiting, and the reeducation of
white students concerning Afri-
can-American culture.

T-As President of the Black Stu-
dent Coalition, all that I can say is
that our doors are open to anyone.
Butat the same time, I’m not going
to beg anyone, black or white, to
become involved with the BSC.
And please, don’t come feeling
guilty!

R-Word! Let’s go see Malcom x,
like the rest of the Davidson popu-
lation is going to do, right? Yo
Rock!... that was awesome!

‘T-Awesome?...Oh, it's a Zulu

the mashed potatoes with Giblet
gravy, and the Stove Top Stuffing;
men have been sitting around per-.
fecting their ability to belch
America the Beautiful in C minor
and rhythmically coordinate de-
lightful armpitnoises. Somewhere
in the Women’s movement, the
women realized how unfair this
situation was, stood up and de-
manded: “Wealso want something
we can watch that ‘allows us to sit
around perfecting our ability to
belch America the Beautiful in C
minor and rhythmically coordinate
armpit noises!” Thus they got an-

other Thanksgiving television tra-
dition: The Macy’s Thanksgiving
Day Parade.

The Macy’s Thanksgiving
Day Paradeallows viewers allover
America to watch the people of
New York stare at the underside of
big polyethylene helium inflated
cartoon characters. Many New

York parents drag their kids out of |

bed and line them up in the streets
of New York so their kids can
understand and enjoy parade tradi-
tion, meet friendly New Yorkers
and be the talk of kindergarten the
following week when they boast to
the other unlucky five year old’s:
“Mommy told me that the big yel-
low blob I saw through the fat
man’s bald spot was really Big

Bird’s thumb!”

On Thursday, many of us will
be going home to celebrate the
traditional Thanksgiving with fam-
ily and friends. We’re probably
going to watch alittle football with
the family or at least listen to Aunt
Fran’s tripto Bermudaduring com-
mercials. We're going to enjoy
sitting down at the table and finish-
ing off the many foods that the
relatives brought too much of. And
we're going to enjoy it. Happy
Thanksgiving! And remember, if
Mom should ask you how the tur-
key was, just tell say it like it is:
“WHAT?!! NO PASS INTER-
FERENCE?!! He was all over the

guy! ”

Karl Malone Was Way Off Base

read that Magic Johnson has re-
tired for the second time. He didn’t
retire because he couldn’ t compete
anymore or because he sustained a
career-ending injury;. he retired
because of ignorant people. A good
example of one of these people is
Karl Malone. Karl Malone plays
for the Utah Jazz, and was a team-

mate of Magic’s on the Dream
Team in Barcelona. In The New
York Times he said:
“Lookatthecutsand scratches
I get now. All of the sudden, the
last second of the game, and here

~ comes Magic to the basket. It’s the

same as, what if I had the virus as
a player and what if a Buck Will-
iams or a Charles Barkley comes
in? It is a physical game and you
getkicked and scratched. I dohave
concerns, just like anybody would

have. It’s not a thing of kicking a
man when he’s down.”

Malone seems to think he is
still in the third grade. It sounds
like he thinks AIDS is like the
cooties; if youare touched by some
one with AIDS, then you get it too.
The odds of catching the AIDS
virus during a basketball game is
about equal to the odds of falling
off a twenty story building and
living. Well, I’ve rambled on long
enough. Bye.

Davidson. It is an extremely rare
individual among us who has.not
come into contact with gays
throughout the courses of ourdaily
lives.

You most likely do not even
know that some of these people are
gay; in fact, you probably assume
they are straight and never con-
sider otherwise.

The point is that sexual orien-
tation should not be the basis for
legislation. Sexual conduct should

be. Those who infringe on others’

, Tights, be they homosexual or het-

erosexual, should certainly be dis-
ciplined. Punishing someone solely
on the basis of his or her sexual
orientation appears to be the result
of ignorance and fear.

Lifting the military ban on
gays is just one small part of a far
greater issue. Government cannot
change people’s attitudes, but it is
not entirely powerless in eradicat-
ing injustices. President-elect

Clinton’s proposal is an example’

of such legislation. ’

turbing pattern is slight compared
to the Baby Boom’s failure to give
its children boundless horizons. Far
too many of our generation’s fold
grow up feeling stuck—constricted

” by societal forces that they cannot

control. The situation is worst in
our inner cities where children see
gang membership as their only
form of identity and drug dealing
as the only means of escaping pov-
erty. The extentof this feeling does
not stop in the streets, however.

Here at Davidson, for instance, .

one finds a surprising degree of
concern and even pessimism about
our prospects for finding a place in

the world after graduation. People
our age all over America, in fact,
through a combination of having
theirheroes demythicized and their
visions of the future undercut by
the present reality, have lost much
of their youthful enthusiasm. They
wonder, frankly, if the American
dream still exists.

So how are we toreactto all of
this? Are we to blame our parents
for starting our generation off on
the wrong foot? I think not. The
mosteffective way wecan respond
to the Baby Boom’s weaknesses is
to be aware of the mistakes so that
we do not make them ourselves. If
we realize our moral obligations to
our children now, we will, unlike
our parents, be able to say in 25
“ years that we have succeeded.
