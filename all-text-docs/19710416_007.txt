John Harper. They.have good
team speed, are hitting well
and have excellent depth.

Managers Boost Netters

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Sports Writer

The Wildeat tennis * team
has compiled a 10-4 record
thus far this season, and no
small part of this accom
plishment can be attributed
to two people who don’t even
wear a uniform or swing a
racket.

Mike Hood, a senior from
Decatur, Ga., and Jimmy
Edwards, a sophomore’ fr6m
City, are the work-
study boys Who are respon-

Forest

ible for the condition of the

varsity courts and surround-
ing area.

The tools of their job are
brooms, jugs of Gatorade so
lution, and tireless legs.

Their duties consist of wa-
tering the courts “at, night,
sweeping the playing surface
between individual matches,
mixing refreshments, doing
the team’s laundry, policing
the grounds as well as the

tennis house, chasing balls

talao it all, We definitely have
the material.”

The ‘Machis -have been the
surprise of the league so far.
Terribly thin “in numbers,
they have gotten good hit
ting throughout’ the lineup
and a good defensive job,
and rate an outside chance.

According to Goach Jack
Latimer, “If we stay healthy
and get a little more. con-
sistency, we'll be around for

the playoffs. We're getting
good overall effort, good
clutch hitting, and the de

fense seems to be working
together better."’

Crafty Phil Dotts has im-
pressed on the mound thus
far. Steady Bob Randall
catches, while: Walt Walker
holds down third. John Saun-
ders has good range at short,
with Rick Weddle and Kelly
McKee on the right side,

Versatile Herb Clegg and
Jim Hudson, the team's best
hitter, both veterans, team
with Reif Kessler in the out-
field.

The picture in League B is
muddled. Due to several for-
feits, it is hard to say who
has what.

The SPEs and Pikas fig
ure to be the favorites, but
neither has shown anything
yet. The Gamms and Indies
are other possible threats,
but it is impossible to tell at
this writing

In games played last week,
the Delis pounded the Pikas
19-4 in a surprise, then
trounced Watts-Belk 12-0. The
Machis hammered the KAs
17-6 as Hudson rapped 4 hits
and six teammates had two
each.

The Sigs edged East | 4-3
on. John Maloney’s eighth in-
ning double. The Taus wal-
loped Cannon 1 154 as Hick
man tagged a round tripper.

The Indies outlasted SAEs
17-10, and Cannon I defeated
Cannon II 6-4, and the Pikas
belted East II 17-2.

which go over the fence, and
keeping score.

Edwards described the
work as a good deal, which
he really enjoys. Despite the
seemingly endless errands,
he still has time to watch the
matches,

“T expect to be busy when.

the tournament comes here,"
re said.

With the arrival of warm
weather, the netters are be-
ginning to develop the form
which was missing in early
season contests. However, in
jurigs hampered two
key players as well as men
tor Harry Fogleman,

Fogleman noted that. in
last week's losses to Har-
vard (81) and Virginia (7-2),
the absence of Jeff Chetwood
and Hy Lankenau was a big
factor.

He commented that ‘both
boys were hurt in the same
way ‘against Indiana State.
They were returning hard
smashes at the net and tore
ligaments in their wrists."

In this week's action the
‘Cats dropped a close match
to: Navy, 5-4. The Middies
made sensational comebacks
in two doubles matches to

have

squeeze out the victory.

Yesterday the netters met
conference foe VMI, and they
tangle with Richmond . this
afternoon,

Tomorrow finds the ‘Cats
hosting The Citadel, and Fo-
gleman is expecting a close
match with the Bulldogs.

Fogieman has been confin
ed to a chair on the porch of

the tennis house recently,
suffering from an_ infected
athlete's ‘foot ailment,

He stated that he is anxious
to get around and ‘‘do some
real coaching for a change.”

The warm weather, Fogle
man's recovery, and contin-
ued improvement by  Lank-
enau should have the netters
primed when the conference
tournament comes to town.

Jimmy Edwards and Mike
Hood will be there, too,

Holland Signs
Second Cager

Greg Dunn, a 64, 210 pound
wingman, has signed to play
basketball at Davidson next
year according to Terry Hol-
land, head coach for the
Wildcats.

Dunn averaged 20 points
and 11 rebounds a game for
his team at Boardman High
School in Youngstown, Ohio.

Last year he was named
all-conference, all-Northeast-
ern Ohio and all-Ohio in the
friple-A division.

He was also named first
team all-state by both AP
and UPI,

“Greg is an excellent scor-
er and rebounder,”’ Bo Brick-
les, assistant coach for the
‘Cats said, “but the most
impressive part of his game
is his ability to hit the open
man, He;zis an unselfish team
player.”

Dunn racked up 143 assits
last year.
