Davidson Art Show:
Balloons, Good Art

In Cunningham

Last Sunday the student art
show opened in Cunningham
with lots of balloons and some
good art.

The show is’ devoted
primarily to paintings and
graphics from students of Art
Professors Houchens and
Jackson. (Only one sculpture! )

There are also some selec-
tions from Buck Lawrimore’s
photography class — a new ad-
dition for the fine arts
curriculum.

As a whole, while not highly
innovative, the show does
reflect some good solid studies
of contemporary trends and
techniques.

First prize again went to a
painting by Ken Freed, who has
established himself as the most
promising art student in recent
years.

His latest works show a
thorough study of texture and
color as developed in a loosely

Abbott Directs
Thomas Drama

Next Wednesday and Thur-
sday nights, May 16 and 17, at
8:15 p.m. in the Morrison Room,
Dylan Thomas’ play for voices,

“Under Milk Wood”, will be
read.
“Under Milk Wvod'', com-

pleted by Thomas and presen-
ted under his own direction in
New York only a few months
before his tragic death in 1953,
is considered among his
greatest works.

The original text, which con-
tains over 63 parts, has been
edited for the Davidson reading
by English Professor Anthony
Abbott who feels that the play
will be easier for audiences to
follow with the number of
characters reduced “and the
total length shortened.

The seven readers will be Ab-
bott, who is directing the per-
formance, Barbara Fagg,
Robert Long, Robert Manning,
Ethel Rhodes, Robin Rhodes
and Ellen Winkler.

constructed perspective space.
The illusion of space is
suggested, yet contradicted by
the phy sical qualities of the tex-
tured paint, thus establishing a
tension between implied and ac-
tual space.

More of the famous Freed
nudes are placed in some
works, where representation
has yielded to the dynamic
qualities of the paint.

Second prize went to the other
major student of art, Kes Wood-
ward. His winhing work also
develops texture, in a large
predominantly yellow field
study.

Vince Rabil won third place
with his precise figurative dry
brush work.

The other awards went to
graphic studies. Honorable
mentions went to Andy Ingles’
etching and to George King’s
water color.

Twu purchase awards went to
the expressive portraits of
George Crowell’s engraving
and Mark Green's water color.
The other purchase award went
to Jim McNair’s pencil
drawing.

Tucker Cooke, professor at
UNC-Asheville, was the judge
for the awards.

Professor Houchens arranged
the show. This year he made a
very effective selection and
presentation of the works, vital
to a show's success.

The works were matted, well
presented, and given ample
spacing. Last year, when
everyones’ roommate had a
work in the show, it was
crowded and cluttered, thus
lessening the impact of the
superior works

While the show should present
a sampling of student work in
general, it should also be a good
show, representing the quality
of art at Davidson. This, of
course, means devoting more
space to those students who
have spent the most time and
shown the most promise in
their studies.

And if this means a show with
a large number of Woodward's
and Freed’s works, there is cer-
tainly no loss in this.

The current show is a good
one, and reflects the high
quality of student art at David-
son.

Student art is also inex-
pensive! Now is a good chance
to start your collection.

REFRESHMENTS,
BALLOONS AND ART

Opening this week,
the art show features
the best in painting and
graphics by Davidson
students. Contempora-
ry techniques are em-
ployed in much of the
work. (Staff photos by

Students Perform m Superbly
In ‘Wandering,’ ‘Loveliest Day’

A REVIEW

By BOB BOLICK

6:45—Make-up call. Liquid 2A
base. Clown white. Hey Wini, I
can’t put on this eyeliner.
Rouge. Hairspray. 7:25—Let's
go, “Wandering” cast. 7:30 and
out we go. Where's the audi-
ence? ‘‘Oh well, wot the hell.”’

‘‘Wandering’’ presented a
series of extremely short
vignettes, and all together it
lasted about eight minutes.
That’s not much time to
establish six or seven different
character types.

Blain Butner showed exactly
how it ought to be done. Butner
played Him, the character
whose life span is covered in the

eight minutes. He pulled the
whole thing off with posture
changes and voice variation.

Beth Ziebe did a com-
mendable job moving from
mother to nurse to secretary to
wife, etc.

The second play, ‘‘Loveliest
Day of the Afternoon’’, was well
chosen for its hilarious lines.

Bob Wright and Susan England-:

er were superb. Their timing of
delivery was carefully executed
and added a great deal to the
comedy of the play.

This was the best per-
formance by Bob Wright I have
ever seen. It will be interesting
to see if his directing is as good
as his acting when he presents
Tennessee Williams’ one act
play ‘‘Long Stay Cut Short, or

EXPERIMENTAL DRAMA
Student players work with theater-in-the-round.

The Unsatisfactory Supper.”
“‘Loveliest Day’ was well
directed. Sarah Hill seems to
have successfully matched
blocking with the movement
from genuine pathos to
uproarious comedy ip the play.
The kiss and the turn at the
beginning which moves you

' from past to present within the

play was imaginatively planned
and perfectly executed.

There was a 10 minute in-
termission, and I could see that
our small but appreciative
audience had grown somewhat
with the arrival of late comers.

‘‘Adaptations” was the third
play. ‘‘Adaptations’’ is the
name of a game show and the
game is life. The play is tremen-
dously funny, but when the ertd
comes, it is also frightening.

Elaine May ends ‘‘Adap-
tations’’ with the same sense of
deadness and futility as in ‘‘The
Heartbreak Kid."’

Suflas as the game master
was brilliant — another Monte
Hall — and Jeanne Ann
Williams presented an excellent
peformance switching from
role to role. There were some
difficult transitions to make, it
seemed, but Williams moved
through them easily.

Ken Jones was the master of
the straight face last night. His
dead-pan switch to the con-
testants’ token Negro friend
was great.

And at last, Bruce Becker.
Becker’s performance was ...
let’s just say it made the
evening memorable. His going
through the turmoils of puberty
at one point in the play is worth
seeing twice. I hope some of
the Davidson Campus can rouse
themselves from their stupor to
see it just once.

The spring term.this year has
been a period of experimental
drama, and it is encouraging to
see new things done on the
Davidson stage.

Hopefully these new and ex-
citing plays will arouse an in-
terest in participation in drama
on campus whether it be as
spectator or as actor.
