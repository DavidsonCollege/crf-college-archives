PLAYING THE GAME
By Caldwell Withers

| |

With track season over and only two more |
varsity baseball games ,the spring sport,
schedule is about coming to a close. The,
Wildcat baseball nine plays Duke in Gas-
|tonia next Saturday in a game which have
quite a bit of bearing upon the championship
of North Carolina.

Davidson athletic teams did not fare so
well during the past week: Carolina ran
| away with the state track meet up at Raleigh,
but this was to be expected judging from
the previous performances of all the entrees.
Davidson scored 22 points to place fourth.

Losing to the Guilford Quakers in a Win-
ston-Salem feature game, the Wildcats start-
ed their Virginia trip in a rather inauspicious
manner. But the sandlotters redeemed them-
selves the next day by trouncing the strong
V.M. I. nine. Captain Alford and his wreck-
ing crew broke even in the remaining games;
dropping a contest by a top-heavy score to
W. and L. and winning from Roanoke by
a 10 to 1 count.

Goodykoontz lived up to predictions in the
State «meet. This West Virginia sprinter
ran third to McPherson and Sides in the
century, was only a few inches back of the
former in the 220, and raced across the tape
first in the quarter.

Hamp Jennings broke the college record
in the pole vault when he took first place at
11 feet against the best valuters in the
| state. Jennings has shown good form in all
the meets he has entered and has been im-
proving constantly. We are looking for
him to give O'Dell, of Clemson, a race for
honors next spring.

Wofford presented a stronger tennis team |
than had been expected in tying Davidson |
|\last Saturday. Last year Wofford was)
jchampion of the Palmetto state but lost}
several good men by way of graduation. |
However, Captain McCutcheon and Carr
continued to win their doubles matches and |
!ran rough shod over Shuler and Lindsay. .

Roddey, a freshman and backbone of the|

|faculty of Millsaps College to hire sev- | fresh team, played number two match in the Ramsey, c
|eral old maids’ to supervise the campus singles and succeeded in beating Lindsey in| \{cClure, p

straight sets. This was the first time that

Wildkittens Defeat State in Slug-
ging Contest 11-10—But Lose
to Wake Forest 10-7

During the past week the freshmen have
played three baseball games, two of which
they have won. N. C. State fresh and Mon-
roc High were the teams defeated by them,
while Wake Forest fresh came out on top
with the larger score.

By scoring three runs in the ninth inning
of their game with State, the freshmen car-
ried it off by a one-run margin. Murray did
the best wark with the stick for Davidson,
in five times at bat.
Harper got two out of four trips to the
plate. McClure easily lasted the whole
game, striking out 12 men.

On Saturday, after scoring only one run
in five innings, the fresh pounced on the ball
and scored seven runs in on einnig. Monroe
High, their opponents, was held scoreless till
the ninth, when they pushed over their sole
tally. The final result was 11 to 1.

In their engagement with the Wake Forest
fresh, they were not so fortunate, losing by
the score of 10 to 7. Although the fresh
tallied five runs in the eighth, it was not
enough to overcome the lead of Wake Forest.
James and Ratchford hit best for Davidson.

We are looking for Davidson to have a
powerful tennis team next spring. » Mc-

-Cutcheon, Carr, and McAlpine, of the var-

sity; Roddey and Bob Crosland (it has been

, rumored that he is to return to school) would
|make a formidable net team.

And then, too,
there are other good men on both the varsity
and fresh squads that can be counted on to
make those mentioned hustle for a position.

The freshman baseballers had more success

‘last week than did their varsity brothers.

They triumphed over State fresh in a slug-
ging contest and on Friday took Monroe
high school for a ride. Baseball seems to be
the only branch of athletics in which the
fresh are even breaking the fifty per cent
line. Ratchford, McClure, Murrey, Little-
john and others look to be good material
for the varsity next year.
