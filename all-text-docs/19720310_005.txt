Changing Situation Supports
Student Optimism For Future

By RALPH PEEPLES
SGA President
It is not easy, in the spring of
1972, to come up with any sort
of consistent statement on where
Davidson College stands and in
what direction it is headed.

To even a casual observer,
there are both encouraging signs
that the college is indeed mov-
ing closer to realizing the time-
honored dream of becoming a
true community and at the
same time inescapable indica-
tions that the mood of the past
still weighs heavily on the vigor-
ous spirit of change which is so
vital to the life of the college.
Still, it is not at all impossible
to be optimistic about the future
of Davidson College.

There are several reasons why
this is so.

There is first of all the fact
that the position of the student
in relation to the college - the
extent to which his opinions are
listened to, the extent to which
attention is given to his needs -
is much healthier, much im-
proved over the situation here
as little as two years ago.

Three illustrations of this ob-
servation are, the way in which
the final decision on the com-
prehensive fee was reached, the
work of the EPC subcommittee
on coeducation, and the cooper-
ation between the SGA and the
administration in recruiting for
the 8-college exchange. As a re-
sult, the number of women stu-
dents who have expressed in-
terest in coming to Davidson as
part of the exchange program
is double the number of coeds
here for the 1971-1972 school
year.

There is, secondly, the fact
that Davidson, not only if it is
to continue as a superior insti-
tution of learning, but if it is
to survive at all, must take un-
equivocable steps towards im-

To the Editor:

“There is absolutely no es-
cape from imbecility as long
as there is a willingness to con-
stipate what should be happer
ing.”

—John “Cecil” .Galt

Good evening, Mr. Galt. There
is a disintegration sweeping the
land, a disintegration the like of
which mankind has never seen
before and will likely never wit-
ness again. This all-encompass-
ing wave of dilapidation has, as
predicted by the dialectic of
history, centered itself on the
midpoint of the cosmos; David-
son College has finally suc-
cumbed to the all-pervasive rot.

We, the gestating spores of
the Continuing College Com-
munity Abroad, have with-
drawn from Civilization to the
catacombs of western Europe
to formulate our plat for the
rebirth of the true Davidson
College after the inevitable col-
lapse. We hereby proclaim the
Davidson Disitegration Theory

our plan for a truly Utopian
College Community built upon
the smoldering ashes of the old.

Your mission, Mr. Galt, should

you decide to accept it, is to
hasten the imevitable collapse
of said sick system, symptomiz-
ed by the irreconciliable, differ-
ences between the Provisional
Administration Government of
Tricky Dick (‘My hands are
tied,’) Burps and the Peeples
Republic of Davidson.

The question at hand concerns
the systematic undermining of
the natives’ sacred freedoms;
we have reason to believe that
Burps and his henchmen hope
to establish a totalitarian rule
over the oppressed proles:

1. Earlier this year Adminis-
tration troops carried out a
staged assault upon a coed,
leading to cries for ‘collective
security’ and barsh ‘police state’
measures on the campus.

2. Top Provisional Govern
ment leaders John ‘On-the-Lev-
el’ Bevel and C. David Corn-
pone, who along with nominal
President Spam Sinister form
ruling troika, have proclaimed a
new eccnomic policy of oppres-
sion under the guise of a Com-
prehensive Fee; said fee will
undermine the natives’ ability

of economic self-sufficiency and
heavily burden the natives’ Es-
kimo Pie Mines operations.

We see the immediate results
of these provocations as open
warfare between Administration
forces and rebelling students, re-
plete with riots, an expected
R.O.T.C backlash, sniping on
campus, gradual paralysis of
the natives’ will, and eventual
complete destruction of life and
property.

In closing, Mr. Galt, prepara-
tions should be made for our
return and the inauguration of
the Utopian College Community.
Furthermore, should you or any
of your group be caught or kill-
ed, the Secretary of the Contin-
uing College Community Abroad
will disavew any knowledge of
your actions. Good luck, Mr.
Galt.

plementing coeducation as soon
as feasible. I see no reason why
that first big step could not
come in the fall of '72.

There is in addition the op-
portunity this spring to finally
make the new social system
work, to the benefit of us all,
in particular, to the benefit of
the class of °75.

It will take a lot of honest
thought, a lot of cooperation,
and a lot of humility to make
things fall together; but it can
be done. The close cooperation
of the eating clubs, the Union,
the SGA and the RHC, all work-
ing for one single, unified pur-
pose can produce a_ well-plan-
ned, sensitive social system
which will offer something for
all Davidson students. some-
thing more than just a place to
eat.

To be sure, there are also
signs of trouble ahead. The
question of the college’s priori-
ties still hasn’t been settled.

Students are still excluded
from participating in the prep-
aration of the budget. Respon-
sibility and privilege cannot
be separated; it can not be the
responsibility of the student bo-

dy to be concerned about the
colleges financial difficulties
if they are to be systematically
excluded from the planning and
preparation of the budget. Fa-
culty meetings remain closed.
The question of governance re-
mains unresolved.

You can expect from the SGA
this term a well planned spring
offensive of action.

The drive for coeducation will
have first priority throughout
the spring. Positive steps for
improving security on campus
are forthcoming. Action to im-
prove registration precedure
will also be part of the offen
sive, as will continuing efforts
to improve the social system.
Nor will this be all.

Sometimes I think we don’t de-
mand enough of the SGA. The
Student Government _ Associa-
tion is annually entrusted with
around $3,000 of student money.
This is quite an obligation, and
if the people we elect don’t de
liver, all of us have a right to
make the fact known - accom-
panied, hopefully, with a little
tact and some honest sugges-

‘ tions for improvement.

Indiana Introduces “Academic Bankruptcy”

Students at Indiana University who for financial or per-
sonal reasons have had.an academically disastrous semester
may now petition for ‘academic bankruptcy.” If the par-
ticular student’s petition is approved, all of his grades for
the semester, including passing grades, are eliminated. The
grades will not count toward graduation and will not be
figured into the student’s scholastic average. This policy
will eliminate the necessity for students to extend their
undergraduate education to make up low grade-point aver-
ages resulting from one semester’s failures.

N. Y. Moves To Stop The Sale Of Theses

New York State Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz has
begun court action to dissolve Termpapers, Inc., a company
that produces “research’’ papers for sale to college stu-
dents. According to Stephen Mindell, an assistant attorney
general, the company’s conduct violates the public policy
of New York law that seeks to “maintain and preserve the
integrity of the educational process.” The suit, filed in the
State Supreme Court, charges Kathleen Saksniit and Term-
papers, Inc., of which she is president, with subverting the
educational process and helping students obtain degrees by
fraudulent means.

In another incident involving term paper companies,
23 of 40 Harvard University term pipers that were recently
stolen turned up in the hands of Minuteman Research, a
term paper supply service. Columbia University has re-
cently lost 150 term papers through theft. Term papers
also have been stolen at Syracuse University, Cornell, the
University of Massachusetts and New York University.

UNC Prohibits Waterbeds

James Cansler, associate dean of student affairs at the
University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, recently stated
that it was his decision that waterbeds not be permitted
in dorms “on grounds that they would not be worth the
time and energy it would take to insure their proper usage.”
Cansler said that none of the eleven universities he survey-
ed permitted waterbeds. Cansler added, ““We must also con-
sider that waterbeds may be a passing fad.”

Steve Saunders, Residence College Federation chair-
man, labeled the waterbed decision as ‘an efficiency-orient-
ed move, unconcerned with the students’ wants.” He said
that waterbeds would add a touch of personality to the in-
stitutionalized appearance of dorm rooms.
