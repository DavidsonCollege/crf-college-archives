Rachel's going abroad but she's taking her favorite 10 CDs.

By Rachel Newcomb

Recently I asked myself, if I
were stranded on a desert island,
what ten CDs would I want to have
with me? Of course, nobody can
predict when a catastrophe like
this is going to occur, soI probably
wouldn’t have advance notice to
grab my favorite albums. But Ican
predict that I’m going abroad next
semester, which means that I’ll
have to take along a few cassettes.
What would a semester in Mo-
rocco be without Neil Young? In
no particularorder, here are the ten
best records according to me. If I
omit some of your favorites, please
forgive me. These choices reflect
my own biases.

10. Lenny Kravitz-LetLove Rule.
Although Kravitz’ most recent al-
bumsare stylistically more accom-
plished than this first release, Let
Love Rule has energy and enthusi-
asm. At this stage of his career,
Kravitz had not yet perfected his
swaggering 1970’s persona and
was nothing more than an eager
young musician. Some of the songs
are hits andsome complete misses,
but cuts like “Sittin’ on Top of the
World,” “Freedom Train,” and
“Rosemary” land righton the mark.

Town), Murmur 7, Pearl Jam -

than a bunch of
college kids from Athens. “Per-
fect Circle” is a haunting ballad,
while “Sitting Still” has a small
town feel to it: Every song on this
record is good, especially the con-

fusing “Moral Kiosk” and “Shak-

ing Through.”

8. Van Morrison - Astral Weeks.

This album came out in 1968, and.

is my favorite Van Morrison al-

bum. There’ssomething very Irish
about this album, right down to the
Dylan Thomas-like lyrics of some
of the songs.

Most of the songs are very
soft, and if records can evoke a
mood, this one makes me think of
spring rain, especially cuts. like
“Astral Weeks” and “Sweet
Thing.” It’s good to listen to as
you go to sleep, a peaceful record.

Garnett Smith: promising musician

By Josh Larned
According to Garnett Smith, a
passion for music “is an interest
that I’ve pretty much been brought
up on.” This love originates from
childhood piano lessons and hav-
ing participated in his church choir

from the age of five.
However, while many people

gradually abandon their musical

talents to pursue other interests,
Smith’s bond with classical music
has inflated over time. This may
not seem that out of the ordinary

- DRUNK DRIVING DOESN'T JUST KILL DRUNK DRIVERS.

Andrea Harris, killed August 26, 1991 at-6:00pm on El Camino Real, Atuscadero, California,

Next time your friend insists on driving drunk, do whatever it takes to stop him.
Because if he kills innocent peuple, how will you live with yourself?

FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS DRIVE DRUNK.

for a music major. Nonetheless,
what makes Smith unique from
other senior majors in the depart-
ment is that his focus of study is
upon conducting. He cites Mary
Nell Saunders, a former professor
of music and resident conductor at
Davidson, as a tremendous influ-
ence in his decision to study this
particular area.

Smith’s enormous talent is
evident in his thriving career since
arriving at Davidson. His activi-
ties and awards read like a perfect
resume for one about to pursue a
musical career. He has won the
Zachary Long Music award: an
academic recognition for “an un-
dergraduate with promise.” For
his senior thesis and project analy-
sis, Smith has chosen to-concen-
trate upon Vivaldi and Francis
Poulenk’s Glorius. In addition, he
is amember of the American Cho-
ral Directors Association anda stu-
dent conductor for the Davidson
Concert Choir. As if this wasn’t
enough, Smith is a member of the
Oratorio Singers of Charlotte when
he isn’t engaging in academic pur-
suits.

Smith’s pet project, however,
seems to be with First Presbyterian
Church in Statesville. There, he
currently serves as head music di-
rector. This job involves oversee-
ing an adult choir, three children’s
choirs, a youth choir, and a hand
bell choir. It is his intention to
continue this job for a year after
college before attending a gradu-
ate program in sacred music.

At a time when many aren’t
sure of what they want to accom-
plish in terms of career opportuni-
ties, Smith is living proof of el-
ementary advice: happiness is sim-
ply doing what you love. Keep it
up, Garnett.

tion of “Money
Money.” With classics like “Scar-
let Begonias,” “Unbroken Chain,”
and “Ship of Fools,” this is an
essential Grateful Dead album for
anybody’s collection. The songs
are loose and folksy, with an easy
rhythm and characteristic Dead vo-
cals.

5. Phish - Rift. No desert island
would be complete without some
Phish on hand. All four of their
CD’s are excellent, but Rift is my
favorite. It shows a band strength-
ening their music in form and com-
plexity, and Riftis extremely inno-
vative as well. Intricate chord pro-
gressions and weird lyrics can be
found throughout the record. And
what other band would have lyrics
like “I’d like to cut your head off/
So I can weigh it/ Whaddya say?”
I’ve found that it’s great driving
music as well.

4. Sonny Boy Williamson -Down
and Out Blues. Sonny Boy
Williamson may not be as high
profile a blyes artist as Robert
Johnson or Muddy Waters, but this
was the first blues album I ever had

and it’s still my favorite. Sonny
Boy is dissatisfied, and there’s no
doubt that he’s down and out.
“Don’t start me to talkin’/ Ill tell

you everything I know,” he ad-

monishes on the first cut. Good,
gritty Delta blues at its best.

3. Bob Dylan - Blood on the
Tracks . This album, released in
1974, is not similar to Dylan’s ear-
lier music. But with the all-time
classic “Tangled Up in Blue” and
songs like “Simple Twist of Fate”
and the raging “Idiot Wind,” Dylan
created a classic album. All of the
cuts on here are excellent, anddon’t
have the raw sound of his first
releases. The lyrics are beautiful.
Those who find Dylan’s music grat-
ing might enjoy Blood on the
Tracks—his voice is softer and the
music is toned down.

2. The Doors - L.A. Woman. The
Doors’ last release before the un-
timely death of Jim Morrison,L.A.
Woman is a dark album that finds
the band in top form. The music is
strong, and Jim Morrison’s voice
is gravelly and raw with emotion.
Cuts like “L.A. Woman” and “Hya-
cinth House” have a slightly fore-
boding feel to them, and the entire
album is fraught with danger. L.A.
Woman proves that the band never
lost their edge, even at the end.

1. Neil Young - Everybody Knows
This is Nowhere. This wasatough
call. Any desert island shouldhave
several Neil Young CD’s, but this
one has to be my favorite. It has
some of his best songs on it, in-
cluding “Cinnamon Girl,” “Cow-
girl In the Sand,” and “Down By
the River.” Neil’s lyrics are simple
but direct, his guitar playing ex-
pert, and his voice distinct. “People
always seem to wonder/ What it’s
like down here/ I gotta get away
from this day to day running
around/ Everybody knows this is
nowhere.”

I cannot say it any better than
that. See y’all next year. I'm off to
Mortocco.
