Village Store expands
‘enjoyable art’ service

By BETH LAWING
Staff Writer

The business started as a sideline
interest at the Village Store. Out of it
has grown the Copeland House, a
commercial art gallery on Main St.

About two years ago, Village Store
owner Taylor Blackwell decided to
expand his offerings to include prints
and a framing service.

This year, ‘‘pleased with the growth
the business at the store,’’ Blackwell
leased the Copeland House and opened
what he believes to be the only
commercial gallery in North Mecklen-
burg County. .

“It can best meet the needs of the
community in its own location...we
didn’t have the space in the store,”
Blackwell.

The community will help us define a
lot what we'll be. We hope to reflect the
tastes and needs of the community as
we develop,” he said.

With this development, and the
space afforded by the new gallery, the
framing .service under supervision of
Susan Abbott is being expanded. In
addition, the selection of prints and
limited editions has expanded.

A new attraction of the gallery,
perhaps its main feature, will be
showing of local artists’ work. ‘‘We are
interested in representing North
Carolina and art in the area,’’ says
Blackwell. ‘‘We hope to carry a good
strong representative of local art-

work.”’

Blackwell plans to have the first
show in conjunction with a grand
opening. ‘‘The date has not been set,
but we anticipate it to be in early
spring when the gallery is filled out...so
folks can enjoy it more.”’

Enjoyment--Blackwell sees this as
an important consideration in buying
art. He encourages buying something
really likeable, not what is considered
‘good art.’

“If you really enjoy a piece--buy it,”’
he says. “If it appreciates in value,
great, you've made an investment. If it
doesn't, you still have something you
like. You don't lose anything.”’

Blackwell also believes ‘‘a picture
must provide an emotional growth
for it to be art to that
And in considering the diver-
sity of tastes the gallery serves, he
comments: ‘‘No two people bring the
same personality, the same experience,
to a piece of art. And, if it’s effective
for them, they won't take away the
(same thing) they brought to it.”’

Although Blackwell sees art critics
as ‘‘helpful in placing a piece in relation
to (other works),”’ you don’t have to be
one to enjoy and appreciate art. The
gallery has a diversified and ever-grow-
ing selection, and “if we don’t have
something, we'll order it,’’ says
Blackwell. ‘‘We stock as we find the
need...the emphasis is again on the
community need.”

Some gems redeem

By ROBERT PAYNE
Staff Writer
January and February are usually
slow months for the record companies

after the glut of Christmas releases,,

but a few gems have come out recently.
Here are four albums rated 0-4 scale
(just like grades except without infla-
tion).

George Benson: Weekend in L.A. to

follow up the success of his last two ».

trys, Benson has put out a double live
album.

With many rock acts, liveliness is
needed to capture the intensity of their
performance, but with Benson's cool

jazz rock tusion one wonders if a live
album is really necessary.

In any case, Weekend in L.A. makes
a good introduction to George Benson.
He's backed by a stellar band and the
music breezes along with clear crisp
precision, Rating: 2.5

rope.

They are one of the folk/rock groups
that sprung up when Bob Dylan went
electric. Steeleye, though, finds their
roots in traditional English folk pre-

served in sources like the Childe
Ballads.

They take these traditional songs in
toto and add electric backing, making a
music that fuses old and new.

With this particular album, Steeleye
has undergone a personnel change

Asa result, Steeleye’s music has
changed radically, returning to a more
“folky”’ sound than the rock which they

had veered towards recently

Martin Carthy adds trememdously
to Steeleye’s already excellent vocalists
Tim Hart and Maddy Prior. Hearing
the three of them harmonize on a song
such as ‘‘Sweep Chimney
brings a chill to the spine.

Ultimately, though, this album does
not live up to my high expectations.
The fault is not in the band, but in the
material.

‘After ten albums, Steeleye is simply
running out of good traditional materi-
al and their arrangements of it seem to
lack imagination. The band seems to
realize this and is making an effort to
compose on their own.

In sum, this in not a bad albun,, it is
just not Steeleye Span's best effort.
Rating: 3.0.

Jackson Browne mold, but with a
decidedly bizarre streak in him.

Or he can be absolutely demented on
songs like *‘Excitable Boy"’ or ‘’ Were-

“Well I saw a werewolf drinking a
pina colada at Trader Vic's/his hair

These two sides to Zevon make this
album constantly entertaining and

last year’s Heijira.

If lush jazz instrumentation was the
foundation on Mitchell's last

Juan's,

Most of the songs set up a rythmn,
often complex, and Mitchell's vocals
provide the melody in what often
sounds like free form improvision.

Mitchell's lyrics stress as always her
search for love and identity: ‘Maybe
I'm just kidding myself when I say |
love you/I don't know/loving without
trusting you/I wish I felt nothing.”

They reflect a maturity and vision
not often found in any music,

Perhaps most important is how well
the lyrics are wed to the music. It

seems that Mitchell has found the
music to match her vision. Rating: 4.0
