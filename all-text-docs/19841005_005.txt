they will consider our recommendations
when they make their report,” Laughlin
said.

The recommendation will cover re-
sponses on a variety of areas. Laughlin
said he wants response on student de-
velopment services, such as the Union
and Patterson Court. He will also solicit
opinion concerning physical resources,
the library, athletics and the under-
graduate program, he said.

Other Uses of the Study

The study is important not only for
accreditation, but also for future student
leadership and representation, according
to Laughlin. “It will give campus organi-
zations a good idea of their strengths and
weaknesses,” he said.

The Village Store has served Davidson College and town for nearly 20
years! We hope our old friends (and new!) will find time during their busy
weekend to come in for a visit and a cup of cider. Be sure to see our North
Carolina room, featuring carefully chosen area arts. We still have our familiar
preat gift selections and we would like to give you. free map of the proposed

Since the study is due in February,
there will not be enough time to effec-
tively apply it this year, Laughlin noted.
However, it will guide future student
leaders in making “long-term strategy
plans,” he said. “It will give more sup-
port when students make suggestions for
curriculum changes or other alterations.
Someone will be able to back up a sug-
gestion with statistics,” he added.

President John Kuykendall will also
use the student report. Although the re-
port is usually done once every 10 years,
this is the 11th year. The College waited
until a new president was appointed, so
that the report could be used for its full
potential, according to Laughlin.

The committee will meet for the first

After the war he enrolled at David-
son. In 1954, he joined the faculty here.
He is presently chairman of the Religion
department.

Along with his responsibilities at
Davidson, Maloney served as a military
chaplain from 1956 to 1984. Presently he
holds the rank of colonel.

Maloney took up flying again in
1967, and has a commercial flying
license. His other interests include car-
pentry and golf, though he says he hasn't
played as much as he would like. He also
collects Indian artifacts.

The award Maloney _ received
Wednesday night was supposed to be
