Precinct divides,

By SCOTT REID AND

The Davidson College Se-
curity Department, known as
Precinct Two, is no longer
under the supervision of the
Davidson Chief of Police.

The Davidson Town Com-
missioners approved a change
about a month ago which
gives Precinct Two equal sta-
tus with Precinct One.

Town Police Commissioner

and Director of the college’s
Physical Plant Department
Grover .C. Meetze reported
that the change was made in
order to smooth out the oper-
ation of Precinct Two.

“This change will allow
Captain Jackie Hughes” to
have better, control of his own
men at Precinct Two. In any

organization you have person-
nel problems when you have a
diluted change of authority,”
said Meetze.

“There were some personnel
problems under the old set-up,
but I am confident that the
new chain of authority will
clear up thosed problems,’’ he
added.

Hughes commented on the
separation of the two pre-
cincts. ‘‘I guess there were
some problems with the old
system. I didn’t thing there
was much conflict, but ap-
parently there was.”

Renovation discussed_

Plans for an extensive reno-
vation of the Martin Science
building are in the final
stages.

The Office of Development
has decided to go ahead with
renovation at this time, rather
than wait for funds to build
new facilities, due to pressing
needs for an upgraded build-
ing.

Dr. Craven Williams, Vice
President for Development,
noted that his office recognizes
the need for new facilities. The
funds have not yet become
available. ‘‘A few years ago,
we pursued a remote potential
opportunity, but this option
proved to be impossible.”’

This opportunity would
have given the school funds
for new Chemistry facilities.
Because of the lack of com-
plete funds, the Office of

-Development opted for reno-

vation of existing facilities.
Plans for renovation should
be finalized soon. Williams

In the campus-wide elec-
tions Tuesday, students over-
whelmingly elected Bo Baskin
to the position of SGA Presi-
dent. Baskin received 704 of
the 858 votes cast.

“I appreciate the support
and hope I can do a commen-
serate job in the Senate,’’ said
Baskin. Baskin’s campaign
resulted in his receiving 82.4
percent of the votes. This
margin of victory is one of the
largest in the history of an
SGA election.

““82.4...that’s about a B-,”
said Baskin jokingly. I feel
good about winning by a big
margin. I feel it is a vote of
confidence but it is also a big
responsibility,’’ continued
Baskin.

Baskin believes that his

who received his tenure notifi-
cation along with Associate
Professor of Economics Cora
Nelson and Associate Profes-
sor of History William Brown
Patterson Jr., was not told of
his evaluation. Kemp knew of
her evaluation, but not how it
progressed.

College President Samue. R.
Spencer Jr. said that ‘‘each
year the department chairman
is asked to evaluate the people
in his department. That is
passed onto the academic vice-

noted that ‘‘We have asked
Director of Physical Plant,
Grover C. Meetze, Jr. and
Professor of Chemistry, Dr.
J.N. Burnette, to update and
finalize the planning group for
the renovation of the building.
So the book should be ready

soon.
The proposal will then be

presented to various corpora-

victory is partially a result of
voters recognizing his exper-
ience with the Senate.

“By virtue of my being on
the Senate for the last year
and the issues that the Senate
has handled during this time,
I was probably better known
than my opponent. It also
helped ‘that I am a _ hall
counselor,’’ said Baskin.

Baskin accepts his new pos-
ition with the hope that he can
make the Senate a more
important organization.

“I believe the Senate should
play a wide role on the
Davidson College campus. It
is fine to be concerned with
little specifics like the laundry,
the eating facilities, or the
housing. But also important is
the Student Bill of Rights and
the relationships of students
to trustees,”’ said Baskin.

“I expect to be working

Cormac

president, who also makes his
evaluation. Student evalua-
tion on SIR forms are also
taken into consideration.

There is a review every spring

which comes up in connection
with promotion and salary
changes.”

The department chairman
would talk with the professor,
as would the academic vice-
president.

Spencer, following an out-

line proposed by ex-Vice Pres-
ident for Academic Affairs

tions and foundations in an
attempt to acquire the neces-
sary funds by the summer.

If monies are forthcoming,
renovation should begin
during the summer months.

In discussing the proposal,
Williams commented that
“this is the ideal plan as we see
it now.”

Baskin corrals tremendous
vote in campus elections

closely with the college bud-
get, and finding an Academic
Vice President who is respon-
sive to student needs; these
things are important,’’ said
Baskin.

Baskin respects the accom-
plishments of the person he
replaces as president, John
Munce. ‘If Munce had it to do
over again he would do it
differently. But anyone in his.
position would say that.

“I believe that there is a
little more excitement, a little
more activity, and a little
more being done now than
when Munce took over. I see
opportunities to further these
good trends,”’ said Baskin.

Baskin sees a responsibility
for the Senate to redefifie and
make clear the relationships it
has with other campus organi-

John M. Bevan, is ‘‘working
on a more systematized and
formalized set of procedures
which spell out the criteria
more specifically.”

“IT think,’ said Spencer,
“that the tenure system is the
only system I’ve seen pro-
posed that protects the basic
academic freedom of a teach-
er. Therefore I think you have
to have an evaluation system
‘that is tough-minded and will-
ing to make rough decisions at
times.”’
