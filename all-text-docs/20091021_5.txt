Giduz’s photographic collection spans 30 years

The average Davidson
student has no way of
knowing that Patterson Court
Houses had to be moved
in order to make room for
Commons or that former
students held a “Die-In” in
front of the library, but a
photography exhibition at the
VAC brings these forgotten
moments back into the light.

Responsible for _ this
resurgence is Bill Giduz
74, Davidson’s Director of
Media Relations. He has been
the primary photographer at
Davidson for three decades.
Giduz, his camera often
equipped with a telephoto
lens, documents the majority
of events on campus. His
work is the subject of a new
exhibition, titled “Picturing
Davidson: Bill Giduz and
His First Thirty Years,”
which opened on Thursday,
October 15th. Giduz’s work spans from
black and white scenes of Davidson in the
late ‘70’s to the present.

One of the first images in this exhibit
includes a picture of Giduz as a member of the
“Thirty Year Club.” This piece is a collection
of first-year photos of all of the faculty and
staff that have been at Davidson for over 30

years. It allows visitors the chance to see

what familiar faces looked like years ago.

The photographs in the exhibition

showcase the variety of activites on
Davidson’s campus, ranging from the
remarkable basketball season in ’08 to scenes
of students lounging or studying throughout
the decades. The always-changing hairstyles
and fashion trends are juxtaposed with
the static nature of Davidson’s constant
workload.

The exhibition is divided into sections
ranging from academics,
athletics, the campus itself and pictures of

sgh Oe

hi mselves placed in

distinguished guests from over the years.
The photographs of the campus show the
ways in which the aesthetics of our buildings

have changed with pictures of
the old Union Café and pre-
Renovation Chambers. Many
buildings from the seventies,
however, remain uncannily
similar to the way they look
today.

Giduz himself, though, is
the unifying force behind this
exhibition. It highlights his
devotion to Davidson and his
success in providing future
generations of students with
the ability to gain a greater
understanding oftheir school’s
past.
