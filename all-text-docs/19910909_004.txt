to knock the leukemia into a
permanent remission. It also
caused much nausea, baldness,
and a forty- five pound weight
gain. At the end of this five-
month period, I hardly recog-
nized my own reflection in the
mirror.

Thankfully, at the end of
this treatment, my doctor felt I
was able to try and get back to
reestablishing my life. For the
next seven months, from May
until December, I took meca-
tupurine pills everyday, as well
as having a weekly blood test
and an injection of methotrex-
ate. I began a rigorous work-
out/diet regimen and took a
summer job in the mountains at
a restaurant.

My summer turned out to
be great: I lostthe excess thirty-
five pounds, I got back into
decent condition through play-
ing tennis and basketball regu-
larly, girls re-entered my social
life and things seemed to be re-
stored to normal. Atthe end of
August, I looked ahead to my
freshman year at Davidson
College with high expectations.

My fall semester was likely
very similar to any other fresh-
man’s first dose of college life.
I struggled through the delight-
ful “reviews” in my classes; I
reveled in the variety of ways
to spend a weekend creatively
and at the same time-- I felt I
had become a partof.the cam-

puscommunity. Once again itseemed
that as if all was right in the world.

Well, the month of December
rolled around. It was about ten days
before exams were to begin. Sunday
evening I helped lead my freshman
hall basketball team to our first
I.M.A.C. victory. The next day I went
to Charlotte for my monthly bone
marrow aspiration.

After the test I returned to school
and went about my daily routine to-
tally oblivious to what lay in store for
me. .
The nextday, I feltas if once again
therug had been pulled out from under
me. The doctor called with the grim
news that the cancer had reappeared in
my blood.

Iremember wondering, as I headed
to my car in the Belk parking lot that
afternoon, when the next time I would
be at school. As it would turn out, the
next time that I would set foot on
campus would be months later.

My doctor said that at this point, to
continue to treat the disease with che-
motherapy would not be the best op-
tion. Instead, he recommended that
we pursue having a bone marrow trans-
plant. I remember thinking that this
sounded like a drastic and radical
procedure, and in many ways, it cer-
tainly was. To have a bone marrow
transplant one must have a donor, that
genetically, is practically identical in
every way to you.

Statistics that were offered were
less-than-thrilling-- only one out of
four people have a genetic “match”
within their family. Due to the cur-
rently limited bone marrow registry,
the odds of finding a “match”: in the
general population is a one-in-twenty
thousand proposition. Not exactly the
type of odds on.which you'd place a

huge wager.

Later that week, tests proved
that, miraculously, God had pro-
vided me a genetically identical
match, in the form of my beloved
younger sister, Lee. I knew that
the road ahead was paved with ex-
tremely daunting physical and
emotional obstacles, but I felt as-
sured that this was one battle that
David Lindsay was going to win.

Iremember that several weeks
later, I was sitting in the medical
center with atwelve year old friend
of mine, Jason, who was in need of
a bone marrow donation.

I'll never forget my encourag-
ing assurances to him that, “Don’t
worry, I’m sure that they’ll find
you a ‘match’.” The look of hope
in his eyes is one that I’ll likely
never forget.

When I returned at the end of
April from my grueling transplant
experience, I began my monthly
check-ups. A mere two weeks
after my return, I entered the office
and asked how Jason was doing in
finding a match.

I feit my heart drop when the
onocology nurse looked at me and
gently said, “I’m sorry, hut Jason
died early this morning.” It truly
can be said in his case, “...only the
good die young...”
