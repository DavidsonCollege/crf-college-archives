putting out extra effort to
locate and present student per-
formers. There are several ta-
lent shows and Student Perfor-
mance Weekends that aim to
display student talent.

The first time gifted students
got to shine was at the campus-
renewned.. Freshman. Talent.
Show. The show, held Septem-
ber 5, featured about 30 acts.
There were more participants in
the Talent Show this year than
in recent years, perhaps due to
the fact that there were few
limits in regard to the type of
acts presented..

The majority of the Telent
Show acts involved the
combined efforts of hall-mates.
‘This provided an atmosphere of.
freshman hall competition from
the start, Various individuals
and teams also performed.

The Freshman Talent Show
provided an excellent opportu-
nity for the class members to
get acquainted and get in-
volved, as well as allowing
William Brown and colleagues
in charge of student perfor-
mances a chance to identify new
talent early in the year.

“Top Hats and Cat Tales” is
a wide open type talent show
that will occur again this year.

October 21 is the date for the

celebrated series of satirical and —
serious skits featuring David-
gon students and their interpre-
tations of DC life.

awarded to the top performers
in the second annual Top Hats
and Cat Tales, sponsored by the
Union and presented in Love

Auditorium. Auditions begin -

October 10 and interested stu-
dents should begin practicing
on their own now.

In addition to two talent

shows, talented students will
get to show their stuff off in the
900 Room during specific “Stu-

professionals, because students
like to see their friends perform.
