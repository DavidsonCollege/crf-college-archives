Burts Sees Warning
‘As Adequate Solution

Dean Burts foresees no change in the near future
for the program of academic warning which summoned

112 students

to his office soon after the mid-semester

grade reports were issued. “We believe this current pro-

gram is worthwhile,

Speaking of the limitations of
the academic warning system.
Burts conceded that some stu-
demts included were not in ser-
ious academic difficulty. He
added, ‘“‘We realize that some
of these grades were based on
only one review and did not
really indicate much. Neverthe-
less, we believe that this group
of students should be given a
cue, too.”

The academic warning pro-
gram was initiated this fall to
replace the old system of aca-
demic probation. Under the new
program, any student is includ-
ed whose grades at any grad-
ing period indicate that he is
in danger of not earning the
minimum number of quality
and quantity points which all
members of his class must earn
by the end of the school year.

A letter is sent to such a stu-
dent from the dean’s office
which requests that he make
a thorough self-examination of
his problem. The student on
academic warning is also re-
quested 40 decide on a specific
‘plan of action to improve his
grades and to schedule con-
ferences with his faculty or
major advisor and Burts.

if not perfect,” he stated.

Seventy-three students were
placed on the academic warn-
ing list for the first time at
mid-semester. Of these, 45 were
freshmen, and the Sophomore.
Junior, and Senior Classes were
represented dy eight, nine, and
eleven students respectively.

Continued on the list from
Jast semester were 39 students,
including 30 freshmen, four
sophomores, two juniors, and
three seniors. 46 students placed
on the roll at the end of first
semester were not included on
the new list. Seventeen fresh-
men were removed, as were
nine sophomores, eight juniors,
and 12 seniors. :

Burts believes that the pri-/
mary virtue of the new system
is “that it places the ultimate
tesponsibility upon the individ- |
ual student.”

“It is significant,’ he con-
tinued, ‘“‘that many students are

no longer on the list. Of course,

it is equally significant that
many other students are on
there for the second and third
time. There can be no doubt
that academic difficulties will
be a continual problem at
Davidson, at least for a long
time to come.”

tablish a permanent Social
Council and elected Dan
Campbell as its first chair-
man.

After a formal motion by Fred
Sackett and an amendment by
David Meschan the council vot-
ed unanimously (with all mem-
bers present) to accept the fol-
lowing plan for the new Social
Council:

“That the Student Council
establish a committee, to be
called the Social Council, said
committee to plan campus- wide
social events.

“‘(la) Membership of this
council is to be 16 including
the chairman. The chairman

shall be elected by the Student
Council. Representation shall
be as follows: one chairman, one
treasurer, seven fraternity men,
the President of the College
Union, one member of Lingle
Manor, three independents at
large, and two freshmen elect-
ed by the Freshman Council.

“(1b) Said council shall have
an executive committee con-
sisting of the regularly appoint-
ed chairman and treasurer and
a vice-chairman and secretary
elected dy the Social Council.

“(2) The Student Council shall
review the structure of this
Social Council and choosing of

the chairman and make any
recommended changes before
March 1, 1966.”
TREASURER NEEDED

Before the actual adoption of
Sackett’s motion, Meschan had
raised the problem of a ‘‘fi-
nancial budgeteer.’’ Since the
new Social Council will assume
the Interfraternity Council's job
of planning major social events,
Meschan said, “The student
body needs someone with a
special financial background.

“We should make this choice
ourselves in order to assure the
best possible organization for
next year.’ The council voted

Petition Will Call For
Student Referendum

By BOB TRAVERS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Arnie Goodstein, Honor Court
member who heads a group of
otudents attempting to remove
the drinking clause in the stu-
dent body constitution, plans to
present his petition at the next
Student Counc] meeting on
Monday night.

The petition, which has about
200 signatures, calls for repeal
of Article VIII, Section 2 of
the constitution. This clause pro-
hibits the drinking of alcohol
and its possess:on on campus.
The rule, termed “anachronis-
tic’ by the group, requires sus-
pension Grom the college of all
violators.

“We continue to oppose this
rule,’ Goodstein commented,
“in order to allow the Honor
Court to place more emphasis
on things which are really im-
portant, such as the honor vio-

lations themselves.

“Removing this rule would
also remove the responsibility
for ‘police action’ from student
court and council members,”
he added.

Goodstein had hoped to pre-
sent his petition to the council
this week but decided against
it. ‘I saw that there was no
reason,’ he explained, ‘‘to rush
this since the trustees were
meeting this week.”

The. Student Council must,
within ten days after he pre-
sents the petition, conduct a
referendum on the question be-
cause it bas more than 50 signa-
tures. .

Goodstein will also request a
chapel period before the refe-
rendum ito present and discuss
the petition before the student
body. He said that he did not
want to overly publicize the
issue, He feels that a chapel

period will be enough.

He did say, ‘I wouldn't mind
having an Open End or ques-
tion and answer program which
interested students could attend
and find out about this pro-
posal.

“I don't. know when I'll
speak,” Goodstein continued.
“It would be best if it could be
on the day of the referendum,
‘but it will be up to the Student
Council. I don't know whether
there will be anyone at the
assembly to speak in opposi-
tion to this or not.

“This proposal is being
brought up from the student
body, sponsored solely by stu-
dents.”’ Goodstein concluded. ‘I
think the students should realize
that this does affect their con-
stitution; they have the right
to change it and up-date it, but
I don't want to see any kind
of railroad movement.”

er.

Discussion also concerned
whether or not the Social Coun-
cil officers should be elected
by the Student Council or Stu-
dent Body. Will Jackson explain-
ed that since “election regula-
tions would require a change.”
the council itself should act for
now. David Powell added, “Let's
wait a year 40 see how the
Social Council functions; then
we can decide about elections.”

_ ELECTION DELAYED

Man Campbell and Rocky
Walker were nominated for the
chairmanship by Meschan and
‘Lee Fanning, respectively. After
Oampbell’s election John Fagg
moved to postpone the election
of a treasurer until next week,
during which time potential
candidates might be reached
and questioned. ‘The postpone-
ment passed 13-3-1.

The other major business was
the presentation of a report by
Billy Clark, Randy McKnight,
‘and Fanning. who had been ap-
pointed last. week to submit
proposals for consideration on
the council's stand on the camp-
us social situation. Clark, as
chairman, read the preliminary
draft.

Several differing opinions im-
mediately arose. Julian Prosser
said, “‘We ought to express our
social concern for Independents,
too.” President Bill Council
agreed, ‘“‘We have to be care-
ful not ¢o misrepresent any-
thing: we should represent the
best interests of the student
body at large."

But Bob Bryan asked rhetor-
ically, “Isnt the best interest of
the majority also the best in-
terest of the college?”

Rather than accept the un;
finished wording of the Clark
report, Sackett tried to table
David Walker's motion to adopt
it.

Dr. Hugh Anderson, 1965 Otts Lec-
turer, received an enthusiastic, if not
wildly excited, response from David-
son College Wednesday and Thursday.

Anderson proved to be a Scottish
churchman in the best Davidson tradi-
tion—even though he is from Duke.
He was very Scottish in speech and
looks. He was also very scholarly with-
out being dull on the whole, although
one student was led to remark, “I liked
him pretty well, but he almost put me
to sleep a couple of times.”

_ Anderson opened by compliment-
ing Davidson. “Some of the best doc-
toral students I have ever had have
come from this college,” he comment-

ed.

He then launched into the body of
his message, saying, “No figure has
haunted the mind of men more than
Jesus.” He called Christ’s influence
“one of the most astounding facts in

the long history of the human race.”
However, history outside of the New

Testament does little more than con-.

firm that Jesus really did live. We
must, therefore, rely largely on the
Gospels for historical information.

These are not simple biographies,
however. “The Gospels themselves is-
sue from the very heart of the prim-
itive Christian community. Whatever
the Gospels have to say about the real
life history of Jesus is hidden under the
Church's proclamation of the Christ.”

He traced the decline of the accept-
ance of the Gospels as pure history
through the rise of form criticism and
extreme scepticism. The controversy
still rages, but Anderson was encour-
aged by the fact that the pendulum is
swinging back.

While the “tradition (of the Gospels)
shows every sign of being retouched”
by the Church, “we can feel well
pleased that the period of scepticism
is waning.”

At his lecture in chapel yesterday
Anderson revealed more of his own
opinions about the historical Jesus.
After a brief introduction by President
D. G. Martin, he opened with a quick
resume of the problem presented by
the Gospels.

He recognized that a study of first
century Jewish and Christian thought
is valuable. “If you say that Jesus was
completely unlike contemporary Juda-
ism and completely unlike what the
primitive Church thought of Him, you
make Him a real odd-ball.” He com-
mented that such studies are not a
panacea, though.

“The most singular thing about the
presentation of Jesus in the Gospels is
the presence of opposing tendencies
in one life,” according to Anderson.

He went on to draw several exam-
ples, especially in Christ’s identifica-
tion with sinners while offering them
forgiveness. This was the “conduct of

ty “wer ind

a man who dared to place himself in
God’s stead.”

Anderson concluded that the quest
of Jesus the man was vital today be-
cause men of flesh and blood need an
example of flesh and blood. Religion
cannot stand apart from life, he ad-
monished. “Don’t you forget what the
Christian faith is.”

Dr. J. McDowell Richards,
Chairman of the Board, stated
that after having considered
“‘all the diverse points of view
. .. 1 believe that this is the

most satisfactory solution that
could be made.”

The action of the trustees alt-
ered the faculty action of April
13, 1965 by asking for deferred
rush and pledging rather than
the moratorium that was plac-
ed on these two phases of fra-
ternity life by the vote of the
faculty.

The proposed new houses, to
serve as open membership eat-
ing clubs, are to be built in
accord with the decision of the
administration after it has
made a more coniplete survey
of the need for the accomioda-
tions and the size and problems
involved in their institution.

Dr. Richards stated that al-
though the funds to carry
through with construction were
not immediately available he
sill feels ‘‘that funds can be
found for it.”

The decision of the trustees to
ask the faculty to adopt a plan
calling for deferred rush and
pledging rather than the pro-
posed moratorium was made
with the idea in mind that the
faculty proposal would work too
much of a dinancial hardship
on fraternities, Dr. Richards
said.

it is the idea of the trustees
that rush and pledging for the
class of 1969 take place during
the latter part of the first se-
mester of the academic year,
1965-66. Inisiation of new mem-
bers would take place “as soon
‘after satisfactory completion. of
the first semester's work as the
faculty may deem appropriate.”

{in commenting on the general
feeling of the trustees on the
proposal Dr. Richards stated
that he did not believe that

“ Board Chairman Terms
Solution ‘Satisfactory’

there was any “real opposition
to this action.”

Rev. Albert McClure, chair-
man of the trustee committee
which studied the situation be-
fore the action of the Board,
felt that a ‘‘very workable solu-
tion": had been reached.

Trustees Kill Oath,
Adopt New Policy

The long-standing faculty oath
was abolished by the Board of
Trustees today in favor of a
statement that the Administra-
tion and Trustees ‘‘satisfy them-
selves’ as to the Christian faith
of permanent faculty members.

The Trustees’ action today fol-
lows several attempts to revise
the long-standing faculty oath.
The most recent action was last
fall’s revision of the oath whicn
retained the provision for written
Statements by prospective pro-
fessors for tenure on the faculty.

“We do not feel it is academ-
ically wise to catechize,”’ stated
Dr. J. McDowell Richards, chair-
man of the. Board after the meet-
ing this afternoon.

In other action today the Trus-
tees appointed Robert A. Currie
as Business Manager and Treas-
urer of the college.

The Trustees also named H.
Edmunds White as Director of
Admissions. He has been serv-
ing as Associate Director of Ad-
missions previously.

Finally the Board approved a
clarification of the Athletic
Policy of the college. There was
no change in policy but merely
a restatement of the duties and
responsibilities of the Athletic
Committee of the Trustees, the
Faculty Athletic Committee, the
President and the Athletic Coun-
cil.

TEXT OF COUNCIL STATEMENT

_. The members of the Student Council have de-
cided to present a concise statement of their views
on the present re-evaluation of the social life at Da-
vidson, in the hope that it may aid the Board in its
consideration of the problem.

We feel that the majority of the studefts we
represent are in accord with most of the proposals
~ embodied in the McGavock Report, the Inter-Fra-
ternity Council Report, and the Minority of Four Re-

_ port of the Fraternity Evaluation Committee.
‘ These reports point to certain inadequacies in

, our social life situation which we feel should be rec-

; tified. The principal area of difference in the above
reports is that of rushing and pledging. It is con-
cerning this issue, therefore, that we hope our ex-
pressed opinions will be of value.

We feel that it is the consensus of the majority
of the student body that fraternities in their proper :
role can continue to be of benefit to a large segment

of the college community.

While we are not in opposition to an experiment ~
in delayed rush, we do oppose the total elimination ©
of rush from the next school year. Such a delay is ©

undesirable because

1. There is a lack of adequate facilities for .

freshman activities.
2. It would definitely

4. The incoming freshman will be placed in a
situation of which he was not aware when he made

plans to attend Davidson.
