DR. ARBUCKLF SPEAKS
AT Y. M. C. A. MEETING

The meeting of the Y. M.‘C. A. on
last Thursday night was preparatory to
the campaign meetings which began on
Friday. Dr. Arbuckle gave a splendid
address on the subject of “Friendship.”
He showed what a beautiful and sacred
relation exists between true friends, and
because of the influence which friend
exerts on friend he urged each student
to be very careful and thoughtful of the
selection of his friends for his college
course. The friendships which are form-
ed in college usually last through life,
and may be a great happiness and help
or a cause of much sorrow. The friend-
ship of that Greatest of all Friends was
then considered and the students urged
to select Him as their first and closest
Friend.

Spalding
Intercollegiate
Foot Ball No. 5-5?

This is the one used in every big
college game, because it is the best
ball viewed from every standpoint.

Read the preface first. It was prob-
ably written last, but the author put it
at the beginning because he wanted to
say something particular to you before
you entered the book. Go in through
the front door.

Read plenty of books about people.
and things, but not too many books
about hooks. Literature is not to be
taken in emulsion. The only way to
know a great author is to read his works
for yourself. That will give you knowl-
edge at first hand.

Read one book at a time, but never
one book alone. Well-born books always
have relatives. Follow them up. Learn
something about the family if you want
to understand the individual. If you
have heen reading “Idylis of the King”
go back to Sir Thomas Malory; of you
have been keeping company with Stev-
enson, travel for awhile with Scott,
Dumas and Defoe.

has not taken pains enough to write it
