Week before last the Tar Heel golf

. were also crowned state champ-

of Davidson went to the semi-finals
in the singles he was finally defeat-
ed, Carolina winning _the cham-
pionship in the singles as well asin

the doubles.

That Virginia trip didn’t turn out so
bad after all. Although two. of the
games were rained out Monk's nine
succeeded in winning two of the three
left. All the games were marked by
many errors and hits on both sides but
the Cats improved with each game,
beating the Virginia Cavaliers 5-2 in
the final game of the tour. “Irish” Mc-
Innis garnered the most hits in this
game, connecting for a single and a
double out of three times up.

eee will undoubtedly be some
jonship talent uncovered as

a interfraternity baseball tourna-
ment gets under way. Monk would
tear his hair in chagrin could he
witness the star twirlers, first sack-
ers, short stops and others as they
bring the tense grandstand to its
feet with hair raising plays. Time
only will prove the champion for
this year but it can truly be said
that it’s going to be a close race.

Whittle, Currie. and McCalloproved
to be Clemson’s biggest obstacles’ in
the Cat-Tiger meet last Saturday.
Each chalked up two firsts. Whittle
being high-scorer of the day with
Currie running a close second. . Joe
McCall is beginning to look good for
ten points about every time -he per-
forms the broad jump and hurls the
javelin. He was one of the strongest
men on the Fresh track squad last
year,

Well, one Davidson record went
up the creek in the meet last week.
This was the discus mark of 121 ft.
and 11 in. and was broken by
Sporty Regen when he hurled it
for a new mark of 122 ft. Sporty
is at his best in the weights this
year having shown promise of being
a consistent point winner during
“the past two seasons. He and Left-
wich are expected to work with
the dash in wi the ma-
jority of the Wildcat’s points dur-
ing the rest of the season.

The famous old-seventh inning fail-
ed to save the Elon game last Monday
by a very close margin. Johnnie Mc-
Innis connected for abeautiful single
over third but the rally was cut short.
A final rally in the ninth frame also
proved hopeful for a few minutes,
McInnis again connecting for a “clean
single, but the Elon boys were playing
airtight ball and this too fell short. It
was a pitcher’s battle up to the ninth,
Briggs of Elon having a slight edge on
Buck Marrow, who twirled eight in-
nings for the Cats.

distance events. Clemson won the 880,
mile and two-mile runs to get their
only wins in the track events. The
other firsts of the visitors came in
the high jump and in the discus, where
they nosed out the Wildcat represen-
tatives for first honors but split the
second and third places.

One of the outstanding events of
the meet. was Sporty Regan’s record-
breaking heave of the discus. He tos-
sed the platter over 122 feet to crack
the old Davidson record of 121 feet
eleven inches, which has stood for
several years. However, this was not
quite far enought to win the event,
which went to Lester of Clemson.

Davidson was supreme in the dash-
es and hurdles, as was predicted. Cur-
rie came through in good form to win
the 100 yard dash and the two twenty.
He also placed third in the 440 yard
dash. Brohard won this event and
Kell came in second to give the ‘Cats
a clean sweep in this event. The time
was 52 seconds flat.

Heath Whittle sailed over the hur-
dles in very good time and came in
first in both timber events. He won
the 120 high hurdles in 15.6 seconds,
within one-tenth of a second of his
best.time, and then won the lows in
26.2 seconds, to tie his record in that
event. He also tied for second place
in the century. Heath was in just-about
the best form he has shown this year.

Lineberger of Clemson, and Cur-
rie, Whittle and McCall of Davidson
each won two events. Whittle was
high-point man, getting twelve points,
and Currie was second with eleven.
Lineberger and McCall each got ten
points apiece

Monk’s Men to Meet Strong
Teams on Present Trip

The Wildcat nine left this morning
for the lair of the Duke Blue Devils
and the State Wolfpack. The Devils
are to be engaged: to-day, while the
State College aggregation will be met
Friday afternoon on Riddick field.
Both games are severe tests for the
Wildcats and will decide to a large ex-
tent their final standing in the State.

State and Duke have strong ball
clubs, as their records so far this
season indicate. Both teams have

downed some of the strongest college
and university in this section
of the country. Davidson has also
had a fairly successful season, defeat-
ing Washington and Lee and the Uni-
versity of Virginia, The batteries of
State and Duke are among the strong-
est in the State, especially Jenkins of
the Devils, and Capt. Allgood, of the
Wolfpack, but Marrow, McInnis and
Kugler, of Davidson, are in mid-season
form, and some close pitchers’ duels
are expected.

few games, and are expected to be in
good form to-day and tomorrow.

ly divided each side getting eight hits,
Davidson managed to convert Caval-
ier errors into three runs, which prov-
ed to be the margin of victory. The
Wildcats started the scoring in the
first inning and were never overtaken.
Errors in the second paved the way
for two more runs and the remain-
ing tallies came in the fifth and ninth,
Virginia threatened in both the eighth
and ninth but in each case the rally
was nipped by a bouble play.

Marrow, on the mound for David-
son, pitched a fine game, striking out
men. He also proved very ef-
fective in the pinches. McInnis was
the big man with the stick, getting
two hits imthree trips to the plate, one
of which was a double. Byrd and Sloan
were best for the Cavaliers, with two
each in four turns at bat.
