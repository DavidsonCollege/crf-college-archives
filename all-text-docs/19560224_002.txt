Only The Beginning

The administration is to be commended
for its recent action in raising faculty
salaries. The increment of increase is
not, of course, in proportion to the value
received; but it is an encouraging and
progressive decision.

The need for educators has been tragi-
cally synonomous with the low salaried
bracket of the entire educational field.
This “bracket” has been particularly evi-
dent at Davidson, and it is sincerely hoped
that the administration will continue to
develop its full potential in this direc-
tion. This should be only a beginning,
not a restrictive limitation. Educators are
yet to be duely recognized.

The raising of faculty salaries is but
one step toward realization of the improve-
ment program sought by members of the
student body, faculty, and administration.
There are indeed many rungs remaining,
but it is stimulating to note that progress
has begun.

Greek Complaint

There still seems to be a philosophical
struggle ensuing among the Greeks. Fra-
ternities have submitted their entire
Greek Week programs to the IFC for
administration and approval. The IFC has
limited the scope and nature of Greek
Week to meet the requirements of the
college academic schedule. National fra-
ternity offices have approved the con-
cept and practices of Greek Week.

Having taken these measures, frater-
nities expect some indication of accep-
tance and observance of this week by
members of the faculty. Instead reviews
have been heavily assigned from all de-
partments for this week with rather dis-
turbing results. The week was strategi-
cally placed by faculty suggestion to avoid
just such unnecessary interference with
the planned review periods.

Since the purpose and concept of the
week are basically sound, since many
benefits accrue from it, and since fra-
ternities have justification for their ex-
pectations, members of the faculty should
recognize and accept this one week peti-
tioned by the Greeks. May the Greek
culture not be extinguished.

Pre-Professional

Seminars

A thoughtful and practical solution to
one of Davidson’s needs was unveiled in
a recent organizational discussion. The
advisory system for students in their
major field has been seriously lacking and
in most places a relatively minus quality.
Added to this deficiency is the problem,
and perhaps this is the basic problem, of
the pre-professional student who is study-
ing in a different major field. He finds
little if any guidance in his selected vo-
cation, and the faculty advisor in his
major is not qualified to give him perti-
nent or particular advice concerning the
student’s intended life work.

A pre-professional seminar program is
now under study in the mathematics de-
partment which if extended may be a
suitable solution to this problem. The
purpose of this voluntary evening
seminar would be to acquaint mathematics
majors and those interested in that field
with the present and future opportunities
available, the obstacles involved, and the
suggested subjects of study and practice.

Applying this type of seminar program
to all of the pre-professional groups with-
in the college would offer many advant-
ages while meeting a present need. It
could adequately present scholarship
opportunities, discuss the nature of the
professison in general, iron out problems
of curriculum and subject matter, and
create interest and thought in the intend-

ed field. This program could be conducted
by qualified professors, members of the
profession from outside our college area,
or by students themselves under organi-
zational guidance. It would be voluntary,
meeting only as often as directed by the
need, desire, and interest of those con-
cerned.

Pre-meds have made large strides in
this direction through their particular
pre-professional fraternity and through
the interested work of department pro-
fessors. Pre-business men have also made
a beginning through the ‘Business-Eco-
nomics Association as have the pre-mins
through Y and related field work. But
there is still a need to be met and much
to be gained in these departments as well
as in other areas.

To those administratively concerned
and to those interested, here is a chal-
lenge to meet present needs with. a pro-
gram full of future potentialities.

Support Gift Fund

The Davidson College Gift Fund cam-
paign will be formally opened Monday
for student support. The Committee has
taken a very realisitic approach to this
subject, setting no goal, seeking univer-
sal projects, and presenting the entire
program in its full perspective.

Nothing more need be said here ex-
cept to encourage each to thoughtfully
and earnestly evaluate the projects in
light of his potentiality to give. We have
no hounding solicitors descend on campus
from the multitudinous outer organiza-
tions. We have no pressurized campaign
from within. This is the sole program of
its kind here at Davidson, and it demands
only individual student consideration.

Support for the Gift Fund fs support
for disturbed children, for Christian ra-
diation in a foreign land, and ultimately
for a healthy and mature world.

As Taps Sound

Last Monday, February 19. the U. S.
Navy declared Ensign Edward C. Stuart
of Bartow, Florida, to be dead. Ed has
been missing since Monday afternoon,
February 6, when the three-man naval
bomber in which he was flying presum-
ably crashed into the Atlantic Ocean some
five miles off Jacksonville, Florida. For
several days following the disappearance
of the plane the navy made an exten-
sive search of the area, but no trace was
found of the men.

While at Davidson Ed made an excel-
lent academic and extra-curricular record,
and graduated, with honors, in 1954. His
junior year was spent at the American
College in Beruit, and while still abroad,
he was elected president of his fraternity.
A member of Phi Beta Kappa and ODK,
he was selected for a Danforth Fellowship
during his senior year, and planned to
attend The Harvard Graduate School up-
on the completion of his military duty.

Ed Stuart never tried to impress any-
one while he lived, yet few who knew
him failed to be impressed. He was an
extraordinary person who was both ad-
mired and liked, and who seemed to
personify all that is finest in an individ-
ual. He was an intellectual in the word’s
best sense, and had a common touch
which endeared him to all types of
people. He was a_ fine athlete and a
leader. His obvious qualities of character
and integrity gave evidence of his Chris-
tian convictions. He had a strong interest
in people. and a desire to make some-
thing worthwhile of his life. His promise
was unlimited.

God works in mysterious ways, and
often takes the best from among us.
The death of Ed Stuart seems to indi-
cate that all of us, though inadequate
and weak, have at least the precious gift
of life and the opportunity to make some-
thing of it. Ed Stuart did make something
of his life, and his influence will long
be felt in the lives of those who knew
and loved him—Joel Conarroe.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dance Weekend Due

For Total

Dear Editor:

It seems to me that the time
has come, and perhaps is long ov-
erdue, for us to make a critical
evaluation of the policy under
which our three dance weekends
are planned. As the recent Mid-
winter’s weekend aptly demon-
strates, there is a lot of room for
improvement.

In the first place it seems
to me that the cost of the
dances has gone far shove the
reasonable level. tt {ust isn’t
worth it to me to pay $8.00
for four hours of music each
night, especially when the
band seems so uninterested in
playing that it takes ao sizable
break after ‘practically each
number as Woody Herman’s
band did this past weekend.

I just do not feel that it is
possible to get $8.00 worth of. en-
joyment from any band on one of
these weekends even if we really
had top-notch bands; and we cer-
tainly have not had top-notch
bands for Homecoming and Mid-
winter's this year,

In the second place I don't think
the IFC is really reflecting the
majority opinion of the student
body when it insists on trying to
bring the biggest “name” bands to
the campus every dance weekend.
I personally feel’that the majority
of the students would prefer less
famous bands for one or even two
dance weekends with maybe one
really top band each year.

As | see it, most of us want
@ band that plays good
DANCE music throughout the
dances with sa minimum of
breaks and purely show num-
bers. And I'm sure there are
plenty of bands in the country
who would not cost so much.
And many of these bands
would, | feel, consider it @
veal opportunity to play at
Davidson, whereas I'm = sure
some of the bands we've had
in the recent past have con-
sidered playing here a chore
endured for the money only.
To me it stands to reason that
a band which really wanted to
come to Davidson would pley
a better dance than we've had
recently.

In the third place I wonder if
the policy of financing the dances
through compulsory assessments
on the fraternities isn't somewhat
out of place now that the dance
weekends have become functions
of the entire student body. It
seems to me that a social com-
mittee of the entire student body
should be responsible for planning
and financing these student body
dances.

I feel that the financing should
definitely be on a voluntary basis,
regardless of who plans the dances.
This could be done by the sale of
season tickets good for all three
dances, plus individual tickets for
each dance so that those who don’t
care to go to all three wouldn't
have to help pay for them.

In closing I'd like to say that
these ere just one person’s
opinions end | don’t put them
forward as a completed plan
of revision. But | do feel that
they reflect a certain element
of opinion on the campus, and
1 do hope that they start some
wheels turning in the direc-
tlon of an improved dance
weekend policy.

Overhaul

Why A Liberal
Arts Education?

Very often at Davidson we hear
students say that it is a good thing
to have a liberal education, and
yet very often that is as far 4s
the argument goes. The other day
in reading an address presented
at the Centennial of Michigan State
University by Ernest E. Irons, M.D.,
I came across some thoughts that
pursued the reasons for a liberal
education, and I thought that per-
haps some of your readers might
also be interested in what this man
had to say.

Dr. Irons is referring here to
the education of a physician, yet
I think that his thoughts are ap-
plicable not only to those entering
the medical profession,- but to
those entering any field of life
work.

“The education of a physician
should prepare him to participate
with his colleagues of the other
professions and with all citizens
in the ‘general art of the free
man.’ Some knowledge of world
history, and of attempts to solve
social and economic problems, will
reveal the fallacies of social
schemes that have followed pat-
terns such as that of the ‘Utopia’
of Sir Thomas More. An under-
standing of economics will unmask
the false: bases of Marxian theory
and reveal the inevitable ruin
inherent in socialistic and com-
munistic programs.

“A man may possess some
ability to lead his followers but
lacks character, or ideals, of a
knowledge’ of history and econo-
mics, or discrimination between
the mediocre and the best; in short
he lacks what Sfr Richard Livings-
ton | terms. the ‘philosophy of the
first rate.’ The foundation of the
philosophy of the first rate and pf
sound leadership, whether in medi-
cine or in universities or in other
activities of citizenship, is a sound
cultural education and a continu-
ing faith in the religions of our
forefathers.

“In any community there are a
few leaders; the rest are followers.
When good leaders are not re-
placed by their kind, good leader-
ship is slower or ceases; the fol-
lowers become discontented and
disorganized and readily accept
inferior leadership. Spiritual, so-
cial, and material retrogressions
ensue. This sequence is evident in
the history of nations and civiliza-
tions of the past. Signs of. the
same progress have appeared in
recent years in our own country
and demand sound education to
save us from pseudoliberals and
from the bad leadership of a super-
ficially informed but  unintelli-
gent intelligentsia.”

I think that in light of the last
paragraph above, we must examine
ourselves and look at our motives
for coming to an institution of
higher learning. If we are pur-
suing a four year “stretch of ser-
vice” in college merely because it
is the tradition of the society in
which we live for those who can
afford to attend college, then I
think we have missed the boat.
Each man must come to terms with
himself and realize that he has a
definite station in this world that
cannot be filled by someone else,
and that in order for him to fin-
ish up his term of life on this

AROUND THE WORL

\

Interview From Thialand

(The following is an interview conducted by Jack Kerr, mem-
ber of the International Reletions Club, with Mr. Piroon, repre-
sentative from the Parliament of Thiatend.

Representative Pircon was en the Davidson campus February
22 visiting with students and faculty in e morning coffee hour and
tater in several classrooms. He is o graduate of Presbyterian Col-
lege, Thialend, and is at present en tour in the United Stetes
observing in particular our farming methods.—Ed.)

Q. Sir, what is the approximate
population of Thisland?

A. There are twenty million in
Thialand, seventeen million Thias,
and three million Chinese.

Q. Do you fear the Communists
from within?

A. No, the Communist Party is
iNegal in Thialand; however, we
suspect some of the Chinese in our
country because they say they're
against Communism, but if Com.
munist China ever occupied Thia-
land and if they're asked whether
or not they are Communists they
say yes. The majority of the Chi-
nese are occupied in business and
they want to trade with Red China.
They don’t think of themselves as
Thialanders, but still as Chinese.

Q. From what group of people
does the government encounter
Communist agitation?

A. Since there is rio starvation
in my country the farmer has a
pretty high standard of living. All
of the farmers own their farms
and naturally they don’t wish to
have Communism take away their
farms. The people who want Com-
munism are those who aren’t satis-
fied; they wish to be the Commis-
sars, the bosses; they have a de--
sire to tell others what to do.

Q. Does your country have e
very hard time finding « market
or markets for your ample supply
of rice?

A. Yes, at present we have a
very large surplus of rice because
we have lost that Chinese (Red)
market, and the Japanese market.
We.used to supply the Japanese
with a great supply of rice but af-
ter the war this market was closed
because the United States gave
them rice. If the U. S. would offer
to sell their rice to the Japanese
we could gain that market back
because our rice sells cheaper than
yours,

Q. Do your people get eny sid
from the U. S.?

A. Yes, your ‘government has
given us technical assistance, mone-
tary aid, and armaments since we
have no Sarge manufacturing. This

allows us to direct some of our
small economy towards the build-
ing of universities, construction of
toads and dams. In fact, we have
acquired a loan from the World
Bank, which is to be used for the
construction of a dam.

Q. Whet per cent of your
economy goes to armaments?

A. Fifty percent did, but that
was before the U. S. aid arrived.
Now it's still a large per cent but
not fifty percent.

Q. Do you fear the Communist
Chinese?

A. We fear the Chinese Army
much more than we fear the sys-
tem of Communism. The people of
my country are 90 percent Budd-
hist and 10 percent Christian and

Mohammedan, and they, naturally,
fear the presénce of China and if
China does rule our country they
fear most the destruction of their
Buddhist Temple.

Q. What were your peoples’ re-
actions to Bulganin’s and Khrush-
chev’s visit to India?

A. The people know what they
are actually up to, but some mem-
bers of’ the opposition party feel
that the Russians have changed
and are ready for peace.

Q. Do you feel that SEATO is
& very good organization?

A. Definitely, but I don't feel
that it is as strong as I would like
to see it.

Q. How do you feel towards the
Bandurig Conferences?

A. At first we didn’t care to go
to the conferences because we
were afraid that the ex-British and
Dutch Colonies would accept the
Chinese dove; however, since the
conferences we are very proud of
what those countries did. They
don’t show bitterness toward their
ex-rulers.

Party Obligations Loom Large
As Eisenhower Ponders Future

A Senator and an appointed of-
ficial of the executive department
sat down at 2 table. They closed
their eyes, stretching out their
sweating palms, and placed their
hands on a triangular wooden ob-
ject. The Senator nervously asks:
“Ouija, will Ike run again?”
Slowly and just as hesitantly as the
Senator had inquired, the wooden
oracle comes to rest in a spot that
can only be interpreted as mean-
ing “No.”

Shaken, but still hopeful,
the appointed officiel tekes his
turn. “Ovije, will Eisenhower
seek a second term?” This
time the triangle goes te the
affirmative side of the boerd.
They hed just used ea methed
es reliable os any other, and
still the answer remained es
indefinite as before.

Since no one knows what the
right answer will be, one method
of speculation is just as effective
as the other. The method described
above, in which the answer is as
the questioner wills it, has as much
chance of being correct as the per-
son who tries to answer the ques-
tion by systematic logic.

1952 CRUSADES

But for the seke of argu-
ment let's look at the problem
logically. There’s the positive
approach: Why should ike
sun? First there’s the “Cru-
sade” that somebody from
Deweyduffland convinced ike
he wes going on in 1952
egsinst corruption in geverm
ment, the socalled “Welfare
Stete,” and for world peace.
Has the “Crusade” been vie-
torious or do we need four
more years to sley the dragon?
But now to come off our high

earth with the feeling that he has
given the most of himself to doing
his best, then he must begin new
seriously to fortify himself with
the equipment necessary to meet
the challenges of what lies before
him. Don Stewart

plain into the secular world of
politics; is Eisenhower, as most
people believe, absolutely indi-
spensable to a Republican victory
in 1956? What other Republican
is qualified for the office and can
win? Certainly Nixon could not
carry the vital independent vote
necessary for a G.O.P. victory, and
Warren, even if persuaded to run,
could get nowhere in the South.
Possibly the Republicans in
desperation could repeat their
performance of 1920; namely,
running en amiable nonentiety
with net so much »e clean
recerd as no reel record at all,
as Geverner Herter of Massa-
chusetts. Thus Bisenhower is
faced with a very serious con-
sideration: the fate of his
party if he does “not choose
te run.”
DOCTORS GIVE OKAY
Now from the negative side, why
shouldn’t Eisenhower run? First
of course is the question of health.
The doctors gave the green light:
Ike could run again, but this af-
firmation was tinged with nega-
tivity. The original statement of
the doctors before the White
House deleted it, was that “the
chances are” that Eisenhower
could serve out another term.
Also, for the historically minded,
is the question of age. No man of
Eisenhower’s age has ever been
elected President, even in good
health and lived to serve out his
term. Shall the American people
take the chance they took in 1944
again, and elect a man who in all
probability won't be able to live
out his term?
1¢ Blsenhower is reelected
a dangerous precedent will be
cet. He will, of necessity, be
®@ pert time or “Chairman-of-
the-beard” President. Gisen-
hewer’s work schedule even
befere his heart attack was
considerably less than that of
his predecessor, end since his
etteck the reutine has natur-
elly been reduced even more.
Certainty this office demands

more than s men of dubleus
health can give.

Thus it boils down to a question
of private consideration versus
party obligations. In which case,
pressure will probably cause the
latter to prevail, and Eisenhower
will be left in much the same po-
sition as the little boy longing to
get into the cookie jar: He knows
he shouldn't but he’s gonna any-

ow.

THE LIMICK’

The only practicing United
States craftsman who is the least
bit nimble with a limerick is Og-
den Nash. Perhaps his most famous
contribution to the literature is:

There was a young belle of old
Natchez
Whose garments were always in
patchez.
When comment arose
On the state of her
clothes.
She drawled, When Ah itchez, Ah
seratchez!

Nash, a comic genius of sorts
who lectured at Davidson last sea-
son, also dashed off this one for
his book Versus:

An elderly bride of Port Jervis

Was quite understandably nervis
Since her apple-checked
groom,
With three wives in the
tomb,

Kept insuring her during the ser-

vice.

But even Nash has occasionally
succumbed to the new pressure of
capsule culture and invented a
predigested form of limerick he
calls a “limick.” For instance:

Two nudist of Dover,
Being purple all over,
Were munched by a cow
When mistaken for clover.

While amusing, it just does not
have the snap, crackle and pop of
the real article.
