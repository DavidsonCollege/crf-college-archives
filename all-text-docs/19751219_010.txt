| can’t wait

The breeze inside

And the clouds boil

Winter skims the warm green earth
And i want you to take me.

In the trees

an irresistible tide

Drawing along

all sound, every flicker

and me

One torrent

surging up the mountain
whispering to the broken earth
lovingly smoothing with leaves.

You never said a word

but you were funny

Thin lips solemn

Bones of your pale feet .
flinching upward from the stones
to your faded tent

up the gorge.

Remembering old prospectors

parched as the earth they know

with iron-gray hair

blue glints in their eyes

that come from prospecting the soul
Your back’s a rod

It grates to bend

Your forehead clamps with pain

Praying day and night stomach caving in

The wind is in the water, in my head
and in the rains

My fingers now have sifted

your sand for golden grains.

We'll never meet, you know
Before you even raise your eyes
i tumble

a splash of air

a silhouette

Fed by cold sunlight
Banking to sigh
where trails evaporate
into the sky.

-Joyce Stahmann
