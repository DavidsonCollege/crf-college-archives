to provide jobs and financial |

ed in the field of journalism but
who would not ordinarily re-
ceive training in this field. |

be a b-arding house, but it will
have facilities for recreation,
study, televiewing, and for
parties on dance weekends.
Plans for next year include

renovation of

of the Lingle House, and mail-
ing brochures to incoming fresh-

group as an alternative or as a
| supplement to fraternities. Since
| the group is not an exclusive
organization, everyone is in-
vited to affiliate.

At present, there is an ini-
tiation fee of $5, which will
be increased next year, the
initial fee being low now in
order to encourage new mem-
bership. There are also dues
of $6 per semester, which will
be used for the maintenance
of the house.

The initiation fees will go to-

of such excellence to send

At the same time, the pre-
cedent was an extremely dif-
ficult one to follow. Aber-
nethy chose to stick to the
idea that a college annual
should take more than a pure-
ly superficial view of student
life.

In this context a theme in an
annual becomes more than a
cute idea tying together a ser-
ies of snap-shots—it seeks to
shed light on the deepest, and
sometimes most deeply l.idden,
currents of the tiny, restricted
society it portrays. Abernethy’s
edition has done just that.

The theme and approach,
then, are right. The ‘62 staff
should be commended for car-
rying on this precedent.

Thumbing through the book,
however, one wonders if the
theme has been carried out as
effectively as thoroughly.
