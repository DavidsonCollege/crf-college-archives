world,

3. Those who let her hang as she is.

The last mentioned group are those
who are meant when we say, “To the
ladies, heaven bless them!”

Overheard at the commissary during
the tailoring display. A certain Senior,
McGukin by name, to the representative :

McGukin—“When can you finish it.”

Tailor—‘Next year.”

THE IMPORTANCE |
OF EDUCATION

JSUT

‘Knowledge does not comprise all which is contained in the large term
of education. The feelings are to be disciplined; the passions are to be re-
strained; true and worthy motives are to be inspired; a profound religious
feeling is to be instilled, and pure morality inculcated under all circum-

stances. All this is comprised in education.’’—Daniel Webster
S oe
