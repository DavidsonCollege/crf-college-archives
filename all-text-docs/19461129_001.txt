SIX CHOSEN FOR SCHOLARSHIP

Dr. Emile Cailliet To
Give Otts’

Professor at Wesleyan to
Speak Dec. 8-11

Dr. Emile Calliet, Ph.D., profes-
sor of French Civilization and Lit-
erature at Wesleyan University;
will deviler the Otts Series of lec-
tures beginning Sunday, December
8, at the regular vesper service in
Chambers Auditorium, it was an-
nounced this week by President
John R. Cunningham.

A native of France, Dr. Cailliet
formerly taught at the University
of Pennsylvania and lectured at
Princeton University, and is the
author of several studies of the
French philosopher, Pascal. Among
his books is “Pascal: A Genius in
the Light of Scripture”.

Considered by American minis-
ters as one of the most scholarly
laymen, Dr. Cailliet was introduced
by Dr. John A. McKay, president
of Princeton Theological Seminary,
as “one of the leading scholars and
educators of our day who devotes
himself to religious thought.” He
was a leader in the De Gaullist
Free French movement in this
country during the war, and is a
veteran of World War I.

The subject- of the-Ott’s lectures, |—

which will be given on Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday,
December 8-11, is “The Christian
Student”. Dr. Cailliet will speak
at chapel and in the evening Mon-
day and Tuesday, and will close the
series Wednesday morning at the
chapel service.

Rev. Carl Pritchett, pastor of the
Davidson Presbyterian Church, who
studied under Dr. Cailliet at Prince-
ton, stated with regard to interest
in this series of Otts’ lectures, “Dr.
Cailliet will present a series of talks
which will never be surpassed from
the point of view of student inter-
est. He is a man of outstanding
personality and scholarship.”

The series of lectures was made
possible by the endowment of Dr.
J. M. P. Otts, who gave the first
set in the spring of 1896. They
are presented every four years, and
are subsequently published in book
form.

French Circle
Selects Men

The French honorary fraternity,
“Le Cercle Francais,” met for its
first time this year on Tuesday
evening, November 19, at the home
of Dr. Watts. After Dr. Watts and
Dr. Goldiere had exchanged “bon
soir’s” with the members, the busi-
ness got underway. The officers
elected for the coming year are:
R. C. Rapp, President; Doug Swink,
Vice President; and Lonnie Turner,
Secretary. Dr. Goldiere is the
. Treasurer.

Invitations had previously been
issued to new members who are:
W. C. Brownson, C. O. Hadley, D.
H. Gambrell, C. H. Owen, M. M.
Morgan J. A. Gullick, C. M. Cof-
fey, R. A. Campbell, M. B. Honey-
cutt, C. R. McCain, A. S. Kennett,
and P. C. Higgenbotham.

The group decided to present
some French plays this year which
will result in several trips to other
colleges for presentation. There
will also be performances here in
which visitors are invited to attend.
At the next meeting of “Le Cercle
Francais” a part of a_ selected
“French play will be given.

“Le Cercle Francais” has joined
with the French classes in working
on French Christmas.carols for
a possible chapel program some
time before Christmas.

After the business was completed
Dr. Watts and Dr. Goldiere joined
with the group in playing French
games, after which refreshments
were served.

Lectures

Dorm Heating
Big Problem

By Bob Hollister

Though thus far this year the
average student has had remark-
ably little cause to conduct a per-
sonal probing committee in an in-
vestigation of the twisting intrica-
cies of his radiator, *he will yet

greet a sub-zero dawn with chat-

tering molars and a desire to more
fully understand the multiple com-
plicities of the schools heating sys-
tem.

Solely in order to avoid the enun-
ciation of vociferous, soul-searing
expletives on behalf of the purple,
ice-bound student as he vainly mauls
his frigid radiator some frosty
ffiorn, an attempt will be made to
set. down a few of the interesting
facts lying behind and beneath the
heating plant.

Originally erected at a cost of
$50,000, the plant consists of three
150-horsepower boilers. The money
was obtained from a bequest made
by Robert K. Smith, president of
P. Lorillard Snuff Company, in
1922.

With the exception of the society
halls, every building on the campus
is heated by steam, piped in high-
pressure mains from the central
plant on the back campus.

The unsung hero who braves the
breath-taking blasts of midwinter
that the blissful student may con-
tinue his dreamless slumber is an
employee of the college who
awakens each night long before
the most eager of the “boners”
have arisen.

Down the insatiable maw of this
steam-breathing monster the stu-
dents’ unknown benefactor pours
a morning’s portion of the 1,400
tons of coal consumed yearly.
Throughout the rise of coal from
the depression price of $.50 per ton
to the current $8.00, including
freight rates from’ the mines to
Davidson, the college has used ap-
proximately seven tons daily, ex-
pending at present $11,200 per year
on fuel alone. Enough coal is thus
consumed during one twenty-four
hour period to reach from the steps
of Chambers to the west wall of
the post office and back exactly
eight and one half times, if placed
lump to lump (all skeptics are cor-
dially requested to attempt such
operation if accurate proof of this
statement is desired.)

A unique situation was entcoun-
tered when the fraternity court
was supplied with heat. Instead
of being higher than the heating

Dr. Craig Gives
Chapel Lecture

Dr. Hardin Craig, professor of
English at the University of North
Carolina, admonished the students
in American colleges to lend their
efforts to bringing about a renais-
Sance in education in this country.
Speaking before the Davidson Col-
lege student body, he regretted the
unproductive and commonplace ex-
istence of our civil society.

He went on to say that “We have
United
States, with its Jeffersonian faith

almost achieved in ‘the

in education, an apotheosis of the
commonplace. Unless we can stop

this degeneration and work a great

to write public education in the
United States down as a costly
failure.”

Dr. Craig) pointed out that the
limits of the human mind have

never been taxed to their utmost.
He issued a challenge to the col-
lege student of today to go ahead
and achieve the goal that lay with-
in his grasp. The opportunity in
higher education in this country-is
not lacking, but the initiative and
labor that is necessary
plish the ultimate purpose
thus far, been sadly absent.

“My theory he explained,

his audience of two srreat tasks and

Undisclosed Culprit
All to Archer

As>the bell in Chambers tolled
off hours of the day on Thursday,
November 22nd, three freshmen on
this campus began to realize that
the faithful clock also shortened the
time left until they should stand
trial for their crimes before the
stern physiognomy of Chief Justice
John McAllister, of the Court. of
Control.

The Court met at 8:30 p. m.,
Chambers time, but strangely
enough, the countenance of Judge
McAllister was not among the stern
visages present. What little hope
of clemency this caused in the
minds of those three ’noxious fresh-
men soon died, when they saw in-
stead of Judge McAlister, that the
uncompromising “Trader Buck”
Archer was officiating.

The trial proceeded smoothly and
we’re assured that these three epito-
mies of freshmaninity received their
maximum desserts. However, this
is not the interesting point about
this trial. When your reporter saw
Judge Archer to learn the facts of
the trial, he was surprised to find
the Judge withholding the name of
one of the three culprits! It 4s of
little interest to learn that Bob
Stevens and Dick Mills each re-
ceived a week's strict campus and
directions to write the Freshman
Regulations ten times for their fail-
ure to wear freshman caps when
we find that the name of the other
criminal has been suppresséd.

This gives rise to some specula-
ion on a subject which has been
top secret in the files of the D.
