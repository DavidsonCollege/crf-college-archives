A Price To Pay

That there has been so little stu-
dent interest in the revision of the
Student Body Constitution is disap-
pointing. but it is not surprising.

To the non-legalist, the particular
wording of the constitution is less im-
portant than the existential facts of
a particular political siutation. Student
government at Davidson has tradition-
ally been non-legalistic. The few
spurts of politica) activity thal have
taken place have seldom taken into
consideration the constitution which
was supposed to govern. that situation.

This ‘characteristic has not been
necessarily bad. In fact it has probably
allowed many improvements to be
made that would have otherwise been
Stifled by sophomoric pre-consti-
tutional-law majors.

Some sort of constitution is neces-
sary, however, to provide the, stability
and power structure that must exist
before any effective action can take
place. Anarchy is self-defeating.

Riots, demonstrations, etc:, have
often proved to be good and effective
means of forcing the status quo estab-
lishment to recognize the need for
change. Actual change, however, final-
ly comes in and through some sort of
power structure. The value of a con-
stitution is in setting up a power
structure that. is flexible enough to
accept and promote change, yet stable
enough to implement it.

If a constitutional framework is
‘thus necessary, it is absurd to spend
months building such a structure, only
to later ignore it as if it were a pretty
but useless memorial.

Because the present constitution
does not accurately describe the way
in which students play the game of
self-government, it has little use. Be-
cause of haphazard amendment over
the years of its existence,. it is not
even a pretty memorial. Statues have
to contend with starlings; constitutions
are defaced by hasty amendments.

Last year’s office-seekers seemed
to agree there was a need for a re-
vision in the present constitution. Ap-
parently, they wished to see it re-
placed by a useful constitution, a gen-
eral framework that would allow the
non-legalistic flow of government to
follow a loosely-directed course.

is requirement is largely met by
the draft to be voted on by the stu-
dent body next week. A legislative
body is created and given an execu-

tive committee to lead it and to carry
out its decisions. The functions of
thes egroups are stated loosely enough
to allow for most particular situations.
The by-laws will undoubtedly be more
specific about the ways in which these
functions will be carried out, but by:
laws are designed to be more tran-
sient. more susceptible to revision to
meet changing situations.

Next week's vote must not, how-
ever, be considered a foregone con
clusion. Acceptance of the draft will
entail certain costs.

The bill of rights is worded in such
a manner that it does not technically
preclude the granting of other rights.
But it may make the granting of fur-
ther rights difficult, because, until
the loopholes are pointed out, ‘the ar-
ticle appears to be a final statement
of student rights. Since it specifies
little that students do not already en-
joy, it is probable that students will
seek to extend their privileges in the
future. Such an extension may be
made more difficult by the draft.

The flexibility characteristic of the
rest of the proposal is not apparent in
the judiciary section. A student-facul-
ty committee is presently working on
a major revision of college regula-
tions. Their recommendations will un-
doubtedly have some concern for the
regulations governing the discipline
of members of the college cmomunity.
If, as seems likely, these regulations
will not be limited to student activi-
ties, the judiciary system cannot be
limited to all-student courts. If the
judiciary system proposed in the con-
stitution draft is approved next week,
and if the recommendations of the
regulations study are accepted, a ma-
jor revision of the constitution will
be necessary only a few months after
the original takes effect. Such amend-
ment is feasible, but it will be a cum-
bersome process.

Acceptance of the draft next week
is, therefore, not as light a matter as
the non-legalist might assume. ‘The
proposal solves many of the problems
inherent in the old document, but it
has some faults of its own which could
be corrected by later amendment. A
spur-of-the-moment decision at the
voting table next week will be harmful
because it will carelessly ignore both
the benefits and the costs of the pro-
posal.

A Taste Of Blood

What used to be just a rather crude Thanksgiving ritual has now been
elevated to a level that meets the sophisticated, humane tastes of the

American public.

For that past several autumns, we have been treated to a radio contest
in which the lucky person calling the station takes a guess at the number of
shots that will be needed to kill the victim of an electronic turkey-shoot.

To-meet the more refined tastes of its audience, Big WAYS has re-
juvenated this contest, making the movie hero-villains, Bonnie and Clyde,
the objects of the shoot-out. Now we can all participate in the benevolent
happiness of a gang-land killing, guessing how many bursts from a tommy-
gun will be needed to do the Lord’s work.

The current “Evergreen Review” features a story in which a mental

patient discribes his idea for a television show that would allow the audience
to watch the details of an actual death each week “. . . for no good reason

except entertainment.”

Maybe “Evergreen” is not as far out in right field as we always thought

it was.

Sick Irony

Somehow that blurb in the admis-
sions brochures about fire-proof
dorms seems less reassuring now than
it did before last weekend.

It is fortunate that the structure of
Little Hall is as fire-proof as it is. If
its residents had been forced to rely
entirely on quick, efficient fire-pro-
tection to save them Sunday morning,
it would not be mere earthly fires that
troubled them now.

The idea of having a fire extinguish-
er on each hall but not being able to
use it because it is locked up is a pretty
sick bit of irony.

Having the fire siren switch in the
security office where it cannot be
used unless the security officer finds
it adds less humor to the situation.

Not all of the blame for what could
have been a great tragedy can be as-
signed to the people who maintain the
physical plant, however. A large part
of it falls on the heads of the students
who have gotten their kicks by playing
with the fire extinguishers.

The fact that students were empty-
ing the contents of hall fire extinguish-
ers on walls and on each other was
what led to the locking up of the fire

fighting equipment.

But cutting off the nose to spite the
face has never been a very wise policy.
This fact is sickeningly apparent in
the Little Hall fire.

If the proposal that the Student
Council find a way to improve the
fire protection on campus goes no fur-
‘ther than most proposals around Da-
vidson, then we may not have to wait
until we -get to Vietnam to look at
charred bodies.

Now To Sleep

The Freshman Council this year has
in its own way been more active than
just about any other three councils
have been.

Earlier this year the freshmen were
among the students most interested in
the revision of the constitution.

Last fall, when we were all told this
was the best group of freshmen to
enter the college, there seemed to be
good statisti evidence that their
high school records supported the

im.

There was even some movement to
have the entire class boycott the pledg-
ing process last week.

But now all but about 15 per cent
have headed off the hill down to the
court.

My, my. It certainly is wonderful
how Davidson can finally knock the
rough edges off even the most awake
new students.

‘The Spire’ Holds
In Shakeless ‘Death-Grip’

“The Spire,” by William
Golding Pocket Books, inc.

This review is written with
humility. The original began
with a general harangue on
those illiterates who had the
temerity to critize the scope
of this column, thinking it too
erudite or too dated, or this
or that.

I said that it was not meant
as competition for ‘The
Times Literary Supplement.’’
and if someone wanted to
read about “The Beautiful
Peopie’ or whatever Tom
Wolfe had written (which
seems to be nothing) then
they should look elsewhere.

But for a solid opinion by
@ peer on a book that: 1) is
literature, 2) is accessible.
and 3) is not familiar to the
general college reader, then
this is where to find guidance
and assistance.

Well. evidently, 1 was talk-
ing to the wind. because it
has been three months since
the little DAVIDSONIAN elf
stuck one of those assign-
ment cards under my door:
now that he finally has, it
seems almost unfair to be
sarcastic. It's a cold. cruel
world, D. E.

William Golding is best
known as the author of ‘‘Lord
of the Flies,” a book which
has now taken it's place on
pseudo - intellectual shelves
beside ‘“‘The Prince’ and the
**Karma Sutra."’ It was first
published in 1955, but didn't
catch on until about 1960.

“The Spire’’ was published
in 1964, so I doubt if anyone
has ever heard of it.

This is a medieval novel (a
character study much like
something Shakespeare would
do) with finely balanced

relationships between very
strong wills and passions.

The difference is that
where the Bard brought his
characters together: with a
very intricate plot line. Gold:
ing uses a device: what holds
the story together is the
building of a 400 ft. spire on
an existing cathedral.

Aside from being a type of
structural cement, this spire
is a symbol meaning differ-
ent things to different char-
acters. To Jocelin, the Lord
Dean of the cathedral, it is
the supreme statement of all
his heavenly aspirations, its
foundation a miracle and its
reach infinitessimal; to Roger
Mason, the master builder. it
was a means of money and
later a triumph of his art: to
Anselm, a monk and friend
of Jocelin, a nuisance and a
bother.

Jocelin was mystically in-
clined with a strong. inno-
cent, unquestioning. faith:

skill, but first with a stom-
ach and a certain greed; An-

Although not all courts have
been so forthright about a
student's inferior status, un-
til very recently most of
them have accepted the view
that educational institutions
may dismiss students at will,
without employing any due
process.

Students did not lose every
case, however. In an article
entitled “Private Govern-
ment on the Campus.”” which
appeared in the “Yale Law
Journal,’ Martin Levine
notes that in the past courts
sometimes ruled that expell-
ed students be readmitted.

The basis of the ruling in
such cases would be that the
institution had failed to keep
its part of the contract.

Throughout the book, you
can see signs that Golding
has spent hours and hours of
writing. The sentences are
made with precision, with
such precision that you feel
like you are cheating if you
read it too fast.

Golding seems to put all his

future do not. fail to call on
him. Final exams _ rolled
around and I was in the in-
firmary and missed the final
exam in math.

My math professor agreed
to give the exam at any time
convenient with me. Would
the dean let me take the
exam while what little math
I knew was still fresh in my
mind or would I have to take
it two full months later? “I'm
sorry, but my hands are
tied."’ was the verbatim an.
swer.

On a second occasion I was
in the dean's office when a
student who had broken his
collar bone the morning of a
Spanish exam called the dean
to ask him if he could take
the exam se.eral days later.
The answer: either at the
scheduled time or during the
Spring holidays: no excep
tions.

These two cases of the in-
transigence of the Dean of
Students’ office are certainly
not isolated among the stu-
dent body. What do you

a student last year had a
scholarship interview at
‘Chapel Hill and an exam at

The student finally had to
go to the Dean of the Facul-

re-scheduled during the exam
period—despite the fact that
there were only two students
in the class and that both stu-
dents and professor had al-
ready agreed on an alternate

and revealing that three

none too soon for a change

Blame And Shame

For a college its size there is no doubt but that
Davidson has an unusually large number of scheduled
events taking place each week. Between the artist
series, various speaker presentations or series, and
sports events, the calendar stays pretty well filled.
But the seats and the stands continue to stay empty.

There seem to be a hundred different projects
on campus for the purpose of bringing speakers or
erformers in in front of the students, and the ma-
jority of them are worthwhile. But as of yet there has
been no successful way found to bring the students in
front of the performers. It is simply no fun at all to
work, and to work hard, to schedule a first class speak-
er or entretainer, to publicize him, and to present him,
and then have only a handful of people show up. It
happens every week, usually more than once a week
and it will continue to happen as long as the habit of
not going to anything not required remains one of the
hard and fast Davidson traditions.

The blame for this non-attendance is usually put
on the students—the events are scheduled for them.
so the criticism runs, so they should be expected to be
there. But the events are not scheduled only for them;
they-are scheduled fro the college community, and this
especially includes faculty and administration. It's a
little too trite to say anything about our. elders setting
a good example for us by coming to these events for
me to mention it, but the fact is that faculty attend.
ance at any one program is most often just plain lousy.
Even at those programs which seem to most to be intel-
lectually and academically significant, the number of
faculty scarcely ever runs into double figures.

Part of the problem may be that there are too
many events on the calendar for any one person to go
to even a majority of just because he doesn’t have the
time, though he may have the interest. The average
student or professor is so overwhelmed by the number
of scheduled programs that it seems futile to try to
wade through the weekly announcements in trying to
pick out the ones that seem worthwhile to him. But it

as impractical to propose a limit on the number of
such events as it is to set up a certain standard of
quality for them. Who is to say what is valuable and
what is a waste of time, even if the performance could
be rated beforehand, which it cannot be.

Another approach to the problem would be to
make all or particular events compulsory. I think
little needs to be said about this “solution”, except to
point out that it would push the concept of the David-
son student in regards to individual freedom and re-
sponsibility even farther back into the 19th century.
Attendance at some campus functions is required in a
few courses, such as at a certain number of concerts
and Artist Series presentations for Music 41, or per-
haps a Reynolds Lecturer for political science classes.
and in these cases, but only in these cases, is com-
pulsory attendance meaningful.

If you have read this far expecting to finally come
to a viable solution to the problem, you've been had.
There is certainly no easy solution, and I’m sure that
there is no solution which will be fully adequate. If
there is any sort of answer at all it lies in breaking the
habit of non-attendance. Exactly how this is to be done
remains to be seen, but it can start with the freshmen
and sophomores and especially with the faculty. If
these groups in particular do not try to break the
habit, the situation will always be with us. If it is and
this waste of talent and effort continues—it’s a damned
