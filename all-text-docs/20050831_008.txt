DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

Vail Commons _— underwent
extensive renovations this sum-
mer, greatly modifying not only
the aesthetic layout of the cafete-
ria, but also its method for serving
food.

With the old layout, students
chose from one of two lines and
could get everything from their
entrée to dessert, including drinks
in one trip through the line. The
new layout, however, involves vis-
its to many smaller lines in order
to get the same complete meal.

For instance, there are now sep-
arate lines for not just the salad
bar and sandwich line, but also for
getting some drinks, a few
desserts, a burger and fries from
the grill, the main course and
accompanying vegetables, or a

.personal pizza. Perhaps the most

interesting of the new lines to wait
in is the “Chef du jour” station,
which features a new chef each
day, cooking the same stir fry.

The renovations have been high-
ly publicized by Dining Services, as
they have even set up handy maps
to help navigate the sometimes

First-year students enjoy a meal at the newly renovated Vail Commons -

confusing new layout. What has
not been as highly publicized are
their reasons behind the renova-
tions and subsequent reformat-
ting.

While one motivation was cer-
tainly to create a brighter, more
energetic mood in the Commons,
Dining Services also sought to
reduce food costs by subconscious-
ly limiting student food consump-

tion.

After reporting in the red the
last two fiscal years, Dining
Services needed a new cost-cutting
method. By making different foods
more spread out and less conven-
ient to pick up, Dining Services
theorized that student consump-
tion would drop, thus saving the
dining hall money on every meal.

he didn’t know the rules so he left

if breaking faces is against the

S.A.D. Member

As one of the few members of
S.A.D. (Students Against
Drinking) on this campus, I feel it
is my obligation to highlight some

the problems still inherent with’

our Alcohol Policy, despite its
recent revisions.

The biggest reyision revolved
around the policy on drinking
games. While it is admirable that
the police are finally making more
of an effort to combat these reck-
less practices, the policy is still not
strict enough. While underage stu-
dents participating in the games
get double the fine, there is no

mention of the penalty for under-
age students watching or taking
notes on the games.

As Plato said, “Knowledge is
power,” and when underage stu-
dents are allowed to observe drink-
ing games it is not only a bad influ-
ence on them, but some might also
learn the rules of the games them-
selves. They could then drive off-
campus, where there is not a dou-
bled fine for drinking games, and
play there.

And that’s another point: it is
still legal for students over 21 to
participate in these games and be
subjected to their destructive con-
sequences.

Let’s think about something for
a minute. Underage students
would only have the opportunity
to play drinking games when of-
age students bought the alcohol
for the games. Therefore, in order
to combat underage drinking we
; must do away with legal drinking
as well.

Eliminating drinking games
entirely would be one step in the
right direction. Another revision
to the policy involves stickers for
students who are legally allowed to
drink. The problem here is obvious
though, who are the people that
have the most access to stickers?
That’s right, kids. And if there’s
anyone we're trying to protect with
alcohol policies, it’s kids.

So before we go around praising
this new policy as the perfect solu-
tion to Davidson’s alcohol prob-
lem, I suggest we take a ‘look at

even more steps that can be taken -

to rid the campus of alcoholic bev-
erages.

thought up that genius idea,” said
Dining Services employee Gina
Underwood, “was finding a source
of revenue for the upfront costs of
renovating. So, we decided to
raise the cost of dinner by one dol-
lar.”

One week into the school year, it
already seems to be working. In
addition to the first-week numbers
reported by Dining Services,

which project decreased expendi-
ture on food already by twofold,
students have testified to the
effects the new setup has on their
eating habits.

John Henson ’07 said, “I no
longer get a side pizza with my
meal because they make you wait
in line for it, whereas before you
could just fill out that slip and then
go back and eat with your friends
while you waited for it.”

Varsity football player Joe Biggs
’06 reported, “There was no blue
Powerade the entire first week. I
cut back from my usual eight
glasses with dinner to only five
because the lemon-lime flavor just
doesn’t taste as good.”

Another student, Jill Waters
08, said, “I’m afraid to get dessert
this year since you have to walk all
the way to the far side of the cafe-
teria to get some, and then during
your long walk back to your table
everyone can stare at you with a
plate full of cookies-and cake, and
judge.”

Despite the fact that Commons
is averaging 50 more students per
meal this semester, they have still
been able to cut costs. This has

. been so successful that they are

considering applying a similar
technique to the renovations of the
Union Cafe next summer.

The drink machines will be
moved downstairs to the
Bookstore, while the Oven will be
relocated to the nearby Duke
Family Performance Hall.
Incidentally, the candy rack will be
moved to the Post Office and thus
will be closed after 4 p.m.
