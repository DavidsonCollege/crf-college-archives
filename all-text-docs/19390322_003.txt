Question of the Week “What
should be the foreign policy of the
United States? Should they join
England and France in drawing a
line against Hitler’s seizures, or
should we maintain a policy of
strict neutrality?”

Jim Gamble, Senior:

The foreign policy of the United
States is definitely at fault. Voic-
ing disapproval of the various vio-
lations of the freedom of the re-
publics created at the close of the
World War does not stop the und-
erhanded negotiations between
Germany and the South American
countries. Our chief concern is not
with the violation the League
of Nations, but is within our own
hemisphere. However, we should
fight if our own freedom is at stake.
Our problem is “economical” not
governmental. Should Policy
permit the purchasing of beligerant
products by the South American
countries with money loaned by the
United States? Should we permit
the totalitarian nations, which have
only recently been reprimanded by
force, come to such power or to be
hazardous the United States?
Should our policy not serve to recti-
fy such conditions that now enist

John K. Cline, Senior:
I think the United States should |

stay out of war if possible but if
our. possessions are threatened or
the policies of the Monroe Doctrine
are broken we should join with
England and France in an effort
to stop the dictators. Something
definite should be done at once to
create a better feeling between
South America and the United Sta-
tes and put a stop to the propagan- |
da and agents of the totalitarian

states in both North and South
America before it has gone too
far.

Herbert A. Codington, Sophomore:

We've got to let the ‘European
democracies know that we will back
them to the utmost. There is not
any use for the ° United States
being drawn into war for the smal-
ler democracies of Europe, but aft-
er Germany tries to seize Russian
territory and a general European
war is started we should be pre-
pared to fight if we must. The most
important thing is for us to be well
prepared. We should have as good
an army and navy as Germany now

has so that we could win quickly,
and with the least possible blood-
shed.

Paul Crane, Sophomore:

Today when war has lost its lace
cape of Glory and Honor, and
belchingly shouts that it is strictly
a financial enterprise of a few who
wish to grab the world and a group
of armament makers who are eager
to support the grabbers, there is
no excuse for America’s killing it-
self to support these super-busi-
nesses, these internationalists who
happen to live in this country. We
must prepare to keep the peace,
then keep it! Let Europe destroy
itself it is must, and if some here
must comb fortunes from human
scalps, let them help the democrac-
ies of Europe, but no need to add
ourselves to the grand slaughter,
what good will it do? Are we tired
of living, too?

Jack White, Sophomore:

I think we should join with Eng-

land and France and stop Hitler be-
cause in the event of a war on the
Continent we’ would eventually be
drawn in anyway, because a strict
neutrality policy is impossible. The
“more possessions Hitler is allowed
to take the stronger he will build
his army, so the sooner things are
brought to-a head the better it will
be for England and France. I be-
lieve that if we, along with Eng-
land and France, “should poke the
gun in Hitler’s face and threaten to
pull the trigger if he made one
more move” that Mr. Hitler would
be greatly influenced not to make
amy more moves.

Ney Featured
By Radio Play

Davidson's weekly radio program
was featured last night by the pre-
sentation of a play concerning Mar-
shall Ney, «written especially for
the centennial celebration of 1937.
The play deals mainly with the
subject: “Did Marshall Ney escape
from France and settle in the Pied-
mont section of North Carolina?”

The musical part of the program
was presented as usual bythe Da-
vidson Little Symphony Orchestra.
Among the selections heard were
“El Capitan ,» March,” . “Men : of
Ohio,” “America We,” and “Them
Basses.’ The regular hymn was this
time “Come Thou Almighty King.”

Committee
Plans Way
Of Auditing

Mr: Jackson Discusses Audit-
ing of Campus Student
Organizations

The Student-Faculty Relations
Committee met last Thursday night
in the faculty room, and the dis-
cussion at this meeting was par-
ticularly concerned with the ad-
visability of setting up some sort
of auditing system for the yarious
student organizations on the cam-
pus.

Mr. F. L. Jackson was present
and expressed his ideas and convic-
tions on the subject. Various opin-
ions were also expressed by other
faculty and student members. Al-
though members of the student
body were invited to attend this
meeting, few responded to the in-
vitation,

The purpose of the committee is
to have the opinions of the faculty
and students presented in an accu-
rate way. This committee is made
up of Dr. P. H. Gwynn, Dr. C. K.
Brown and Professor F. K, Fleagle
from the faculty and the presidents
of the Senior, Junior, and Sopho-
more classes, Sam Newell, Gales
McClintock, and Hank Bahnson re-
spectively, the Freshman adviser,
Warren Gaw, and Fred Stair, who
was elected by the Student Coun-
cil, from the student body.

Discussion problenis of moment
to both the student body and to
the college as a whole are brought
up in the meetings of the commit-
tee. Some of these are: the need
for a change in the present dam-
age deposit system, the necessity of
changing the Orientation program,
and the problem which has arisen
concerning the boarding house sit-
uation as it pertains to athletics.

Any opinions which the students
may wish to put forward may be
either submitted to a member of
this committee, or the students may
themselves participate in the dis-
cussion at the next meeting, the
time of which will be announced in
chapel.

Library Gets
Newest Book
By Head Nazi

Mein Kampf Among Library’s
Newest Volumes

In the last week the library has
received new books, some
of which are already famous.

By far the most sensational book

Hitler’s Mein Kampf. As the
“Nazi Bible,” it has earned its auth-
or $3,000,000 in royalties, has had
sales in six other countries amount-
ing to $120,000. In 1933 an abridged
edition was published in the U. S.,
but condensation impaired it by
omitting much of Hitler’s amazing-
ly faithful prophecy of his subse-
quent foreign policy. Written in
1924-'26 when Der Feuhrer was an
irresponsible rabble-rouser, Mein
Kampf is full of ranting and raving,
became something of a diplomatic
embarrassment, and had to be ton-
ed down in German editions. How-
ever, the library's edition (Reynal
& Hitchcock) is unexpurgated and
annotated to show the sections o-
mitted from German issues.

Also just put up on the library
shelves are two new books on
European affairs—The New West-
ern Front by Stuart Chase and
John Gunther’s Inside Europe.
Chase, who has written a number
of books on economics and govern-
ment, explains the various ways in
which the U. S. differs from Europe
and tells why we do not need to go
to war. Backing up his statements
with an exceptional amount of ac-
curate information, Chase advises
“Keep your powder dry. Until the
real emergency comes, if it is to
come, don’t be stampeded.”

In his book John Gunther, who
knows personally many of Europe’s
outstanding personalities including
Hitler, Mussolini, et al., summarizes
his more than a decade’s experi-
ence as the foreign correspondent
of several American newspapers
and news services. The book was
first published in 1936 but the new
issue has been. edited to bring it
up to date.

Rev. Grier Davis Leads

Sunday Night Vespers

Dr. Davis Speaks on “Doing
Things We Had Never
Done Before”

Reverend C. Grier Davis
spoke to the Davidson student
body at the regular vesper ser-
vices Sunday night.

This was the second appearance
of Reverend Davis at Davidson. He
had already spoken at the regular
Sunday morning services at the
College Church for Dr. Moffett,
the regular pastor. At this service
Reverend Grier Davis spoke on
“Doing things we had never done
before.” He is here under the spon-
sorship of the Y.M.C.A. as the
principal speaker for the Spring
Services.

Introduction

Dr. Davis was introduced by
Sherrard Rice, who also substituted
for Reverend I. M. Ellis by leading
the singing. Rice concluded this
introduction by assuring the stu-
dent body that any Who wished to
confer with Mr. Davis would be
more than welcome to obtain an
appointment through Wade Boggs.

Analyzes Faith

In his address, Mr. Davis analyz-
ed faith and what it meant to 1S
in. everyday life. He said ‘that a
number of people thought of faith
as credulity but this was distinctly
not the case. It was, he said, the
answer to those that lay distracted
in the ditches of doubt and confus-
ion. He defined faith as seizing
hold of God to understand him and
make him superior over our will.
He declared that it consisted of two
elements: conviction and adventure.
Conviction is a well founded as-
surance of things not seen. By this
faith we can have all the full value
of a conviction of God, of future
life, of love and the many other in-
transitive qualities that we are not
able to benefit from without faith.

Grand Adventure

Faith, Mr. Davis said was also a
glorious, grand adventure. This ad-
venture consists of not just believ-
ing in something, but living our lives
as if we did believe it. Every act
of our every day life, from going to
school, niaking decisions, making
starts in business, and getting mar-
ried, was an adventure of faith.

In conclusion, Mr. Davis chal-
