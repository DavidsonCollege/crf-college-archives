Income from Auxiliary

Enterprises

The income from auxiliary
enterprises is almost an exten-
sion of tuition and fees. Most of
the money comes directly from
students: Davidson and Currie
agree the figure is ‘‘over 85
percent.”’

Auxiliary enterprises include
the dormitories, the student
store, the laundry, the Patter-
son Court eating houses, Car-
negie Guest House, and a few
smaller operations. They ac-
count for 19 percent of the
operating budget, but Davidson
describes them primarily as
‘break even” propositions.

The portion of the income
from auxiliary enterprises not
provided by students comes
from, for example, visitors and
College staff who buy things at
the student store, guests at
Carnegie, and outsiders who use
the laundry service.

Income from Government

Sources

Davidson students received
$176,000 worth of government
aid in 1979-80, which represents
about 1.5 percent of the opera-
ting budget. These funds are
not solicited by the College, but
are normally paid directly to
students’ accounts to supple-
ment their tuition and fees.

Income from Gifts and Private
Grants

Davidson received $1.53 mil-
lion in gifts in’ 1979-80, or
enough to finance about 13
percent of the operating budget,
according to Davidson.

Though fees from students |

and income from endowments
and trusts are guaranteed at the
start of each fiscal year, the
College must constantly solicit
gifts.

Director of Corporate Deve-
lopment Mike Daisley described
this fundraising process as one
of ‘filling in the cracks’ bet-
ween the more assured income
sources. He said the percentage

of the College income that gifts
and private grants provide ‘‘Is
the difference between a medi-
ocre year. . .and a really great
year.”

Alumni and charitable foun-
dations are the two largest
sources of gifts. According to
Davidson, alumni gave
$491,000 of the $1.53 million
total in 1979-80, and found-
ations gave $513,000. Friends
of the College, students’ par-
ents, churches, and corpora-
tions also gave. significant
amounts.

Compared to some other lib-
eral arts colleges, especially
ones in the Northeast, a very
low percentage of Davidson
alumni give to the College.
Melton restated the Develop-
ment Department’s present ef-
forts of making ‘‘a major step
forward to increase the percen-
tage participation by alumni—
and the dollar gifts.” He sur-
mised that few alumni give
because there is no strong
‘‘tradition’’ of such support,
then jokingly added that as
students, alumni were imbued
with a spirit of ‘God would
provide for Davidson.”

Unfortunately, gifts from
churches have not kept pace
with inflation, Melton and
Davidson said.

Income from Trusts

Trust income comes from
about fifteen different funds
that the College neither owns
nor controls, but which by legal
agreement provide the College
with yearly income.

According to Davidson, the
largest of these trusts is the
Duke Endowment, which gen-
erated 84° of the College’s
1980 trust income of $993,000.
Sinee this trust was set up in
1925, it has provided the Col-
lege with yearly returns total-
ling $20 million, Davidson said.

Income from Endowments

Like trusts, endowments pro-
vide the College with annual
returns on funds that are per-
manently invested. Melton

Development

October 3, 1980— The Davidsonian— 11

compared them to an indivi-
dual’s establishing a savings
account and then never touch-
ing the principle while constant-
ly using the interest.

Unlike trusts, the College
itself determines how to invest
its endowment. The object is to
seek the investments that maxi-
mize the endowment’s yield.

Last year, according to Dav-
idson, the College’s endowment
produced seven and a half to
eight percent in interest and

‘dividends. This figure is lower

than the rate of return one could
get from a bank (around 12
percent) because the College
must maximize the endow-
ment’s growth as well as its
annual return, Davidson said.
Thus, total yield on the endow-
ment last year was around 17.7
percent because the endowment
increased substantially in mar-
ket value.

Melton explained that it
would be ‘‘at the expense of the
next generation of students” if
the College maximized annual
income from interest and divi-
dends to the neglect of the
growth of the endowment itself.
Because of inflation, return on
the endowment decreases in the
long run unless the College
ensures that the endowment
constantly increases in market
value. For example, Melton
said, a $100,000 endowment
established in 1970 would be
worth only half that amount
today (in constant dollars) if the
College made no provisions for
its growth.

According to Davidson, the
endowment provided $1.47 mil-
lion or 12.4% of the College’s
1979-80 operating budget. He
said the size of the endowment
puts the College ‘‘in good
shape.”

Melton, however, said that
while the College’s endowment
is high compared to other
Southern liberal arts schools, it
‘is low compared to the kind of
colleges we like to compare
ourselves with.”

(Continued from page 1)

The common figure of com-
parison is endowment per stu-
dent, which is determined by
the market value of a college’s
total endowment divided by the
college’s enrollment. In a study

completed bUy former Director

of Development Duane Dittman
in 1978, Davidson’s $20.48 mil-
lion endowment divided by 1356
students yielded an endowment
per student of $15,174.

Melton pointed out that
schools like Williams and
Swarthmore doubled our en-
dowment. According to Ditt-
man’s study, Swarthmore had
an endowment per student of
$52,177 and Williams of
$37,195.

Emphasis on increasing the
endowment is forthcoming. ‘‘we
have not yet gotten into the
phase of the 1987 Program in
which we are asking everyone
for capital funds (i.e., funds
added to the endowment),”’
Melton said. ‘‘We are still
asking for annual gifts Lee.,
funds added to gifts and private
grants and spent in the opera-
ting budget.”

Other Income

The College keeps less than
$8000 in cash on hand though
accounts payable exceed
$500,000, according to the Col-
lege’s 1979 Balance Sheet.

Davidson explained that the
rest of the cash the College
needs to meet its obligations is
invested on a short term basis —
for example, in revolving notes
that allow liquidation on an
almost daily basis. ‘‘We try to
keep ‘bur funds] invested until
the moment we need them,”’
Davidson said.

Such short term investments
provided $445,000 in income in
1979-80 or almost four percent
of the operating budget, David-
son said.

Just to Keep the Lights On

All these sources of income
cover is day-to-day operating
expenses. The College also has a
multi-million dollar Physical
Plant fund that requires finan-

cing.

The College is now construc-
ting a Commons with an esti-
mated $3.6 million pricetag and
two new dorms estimated at
$1.2 million- apiece, Davidson
said. The College relies pri-
marily on very large gifts to
finance such projects, Melton
said. ;

ni from these classes who give is
very low, according to Waddill.
Corporate Development Direct-
or Mike Daisley said only
27.3% of the members of the
classes of 1971 to 1979 contrib-
uted to the Living Endowment
fund last year.

Daisley said he expects the
level of participation to rise to
40°. because of the Telephona-
thon. :

The classes of 1971 to 1980
are also suitable for the Tele-
phonathon, Waddill said, be-
cause it is easier for students to
establish a rapport with young-
er alumni.

Also, recent alumni are more
likely to respond to a phone call
than to a letter from the
Development Department, Dai-
sley said.

The Telephonathon will run

from Tuesday through Thurs-
day the first week after Thanks-
giving break and from Sunday
through Thursday the second
week.
There will be 20 to 30
telephones set up in the College
Union, Daisley said. Each
night, a new group of students
will be treated to dinner by the
College, trained, and given lists
of alumni to call.

Calling sessions, including
the dinner and training, will run
from 6:00 to 9:30 each night.

The Telephonathon will prob-
ably reach almost 3200 alumni,
Daisley said, depending on how
many have already contributed
to the Living Endowment.

Humanities

Lynda Suther of the Admissions
Department explained that the College
has in the past occasionally sent
brochures describing the Humanities
program to all prospective students.
Primarily, however, the brochures are
sént only to those students who indicate
and interest in Humanities on their
information card.

In the future, Rhodes said, the
information will ‘‘make it clear to
students that there is no guarantee that
they will get in.”’

Enrollment should remain on a first
come, first serve basis, regardless of the
demand, according to Rhodes and
Polley. ,

There are obvious limitations on the
expansion of the Humanities program,
such as the size of Perkins auditorium,
which, Rhodes said, is filled to capacity
by this year’s freshman group.

The ‘key issue’’ however, is staffing,
Rhodes said. According to Religion
Professor David Kaylor, “it is increas-
ingly difficult to fill spaces.”

Recently the College has placed an
increasing number of newly hired faculty
members in the program. English Pro-

fessor Cynthia Lewis, for example, said °

she was asked whether she was interest-
ed in teaching Humanities at her first
meeting with Davidson representatives.

These new professors are “hired to

serve in the Humanities department as
much as in their own discipline,’’ second
year Chairman Samuel Maloney said.
Professionally, however, teaching
Humanities is not advantageous for the
new faculty member, according to
Physics Professor Robert Manning.
‘It’s a half-time committment to
learning other people’s disciplines,’’
Manning said. Tenure and advancement
at Davidson are increasingly based on
publication in your discipline and you
don't get an opportunity for that in
Humes.” ;
Polley agreed. ‘‘A young faculty
member must have an assurance from
the Administration that their good
teaching in Humes will be rewarded with
tenure.”
Rhodes said that the Administration
has never asked him to systematically
evaluate his teaching staff, although

there have been ‘‘informal” requests for .

information about teaching performance

from other department chairmen and '
. administrations.

Assurance that work in the program is
given weight in tenure decisions is
especially important because ‘‘teaching
in Humes does not make one marketable
elsewhere,’’ Kaylor said.

Teaching Humanities, Manning said,
“is as much of a committment to the
institution as tenure is to you. I don't

think first year faculty members are
prepared to make that decision this early
in their career.”’

Putting first year professor in Hu-
manities is ‘‘not helpful to the program,”
either Manning said.

“It takes a good deal of time to learn
to teach in an interdisciplinary course,”
Manning said, adding, ‘‘to continue to
hire people on a one-shot basis is a poor
way to staff a popular and important
program.” .

Maloney agreed that it would be
preferable for a faculty member to gain a
few years’ experience before teaching
Humanities but added, ‘‘that is a luxury

we can’t afford in manning the pro-

gram.”’

Pulling present faculty members into
the program is even more difficult.

“There are some excellent professors
at Davidson who don’t care for such a
type of educational endeavor,’’ Rhodes
said. Departments .are also reluctant to
“sacrifice a faculty member to Humani-
ties," Polley said. “‘Departments must
be persuaded of the importance of the
Humes program. I think this is an
Administration responsibility.”

Simple arithmetic is another reason
for the difficulty in getting faculty
members to switch to Humanities,
History Professor Peter Krentz said. ‘‘If
someone is teaching a course with a

ceiling of 30 and drops it to go to
Humes—(with an 18 member discussion
group) that’s 12 students looking for a
course.” .

In the final analysis, the question is: is
the Humanities program worth all the
trouble?

“It's the best of its kind I’ve ever

seen,’ Lewis said. Ideally it provides
students and faculty with an opportun-
ity to broaden their perspective. ‘‘in an
undergraduate college, the relationship
of disciplines is at least as important as
the details of a particular discipline,”
Manning explained.

“The program has its obvious draw-
backs. ‘We're all frustrated by having
to go over so much material so quickly,”
Maloney said. Kaylor added, ‘There is a
disadvantage in’ non-experts teaching
the material.”

“Inevitably it is somewhat superfi-
cial," Krentz said, ‘‘and the biggest
danger is students thinking they know
more in the end than they really do.”

Students themselves have résponded
favorably to the program, with over 930
of those polled in 1973- indicating they
would recommend the program to others
and would take it again if given the
opportunity.

The basic goal of Humanities, some
would say, is impossible. But that is no |
reason, Krentz concluded, to ‘‘quit

trying."
