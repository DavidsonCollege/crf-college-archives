would be $40.00 per year for

4. The College agreed to

the Fraternity Housing Fee.

5. The College agreed to re-

It is entirely possible that re-
ductions in the housing fee may
be possible if the usefulness of
the houses continues after a
substantial part of the cost has
been depreciated.

On the other hand, if wear

other factors make necessarv

The Bursar’s Office has sold
378 student parking permits
this year. A number of these
tickets have been sold in pairs

-to students who wish to have a

permit on the family car as well
as their own. The actual num-
ber of student cars on campus
is a little over 350.

There are more Chevrolets
at Davidson than any other
make. Of the 107 on campus,
96 are models built since
1950, and 55 are models since
1955. Fords are second with
their ages running from 1931
up to the flashy 1959 models.
There are 91 Fords at David-
son which are operated by
students, and 45 of these are
models fater than 1955. The
ear which is third in number
is also the third member of
the low priced three. Forty-
one Davidson Gentlemen
drive Plymouths, 36 of which
are less than nine years old.

The remaining portion of the
elite fifty-five percent transport
themselves in everything from
Cadillacs to Jeeps to Mercedes.
Twenty students drive Buicks
and an equal number drive
Oldsmobiles. Fourteen have
Pontiacs, thirteen drive Dodges
and ten sport Mercurys.

Foreign cars are becoming
more and more popular among
student drivers. Of the fifteen
present the Volkswagen leads
the list, with the Renault and
the MG each equal in number.

A recent poli taken to de-

termine the number of miles
driven by each student driv-
er, showed the average of
those checked to be around
365 miles a week, One car
had sixteen hundred miles in
six days and others had been
only a few hundred in the
past few wecks,

About half of the driving
population of the college have
gas credit cards at their dis-
posal, and many have credit
accounts with service stations
in a wide area around David-
son.

If you tcave Davidson during
the week or on weekends you
spend an average of about $5.50
a week on gas alone. This, of
course, varies greatly from car
to car, and with distance
traveled and the price of gaso-
line purchased.

The problem of student
parking is one which will be
around for a long time, and
the ever increasing number
of student automobiles seems
to be enlargening this sore
spot.

While forty percent of the en-
tire student body rides, the re-
maining sixty percent must be
content to walk to the Post Of-
fice each morning and hunt for
rides to get home.

What this all goes to prove?
—one would be presumptous to
say, except maybe that walking
is becoming a Davidson tradi-
tion of the past.
