The Kwangju American
Cultural Center

The vacant building of the
American Cultural Center,
now and abode of silence, re-
luctantly

receives a visitor, unlocking
two padlocks and an iron-
barred gate;

a strip of empty air is hung at
the flagpole .

where the Star-Spangled Ban-
ner had been fluttering

forty-two years. What then has
America left here,

80 Hwangkum-dong, very near
the 5.18 Square

where the citizens in the bloody
whirlwind screamed for De-
mocracy and Liberty?

The dust sitting mute on chairs
in the reading room,

the iron bars stark at attention
in window frames,

bricks, closed doors, panes of
bulletproof glass,

and some questions unquench-
able in everyone’s minds...

Ah, the land’s old cries several
sparrows are

scattering in the quadrangle of
the American

Cultural Center; I gaze up into
the deep blue heaven

through the shadows falling to
pieces, One heaven

of five thousand years the Ko-
rean paulownia branches sup-
port.

To where winds this road along
now? Rise on wings

the prophetic songs above the
scars and separate land,
breaking the heavily-built white
silence, turns the history

its hidden dark face above the
amicable hands

that have been shaking forty-
four years. Yet you would say:

Self-reliance.doesn’t lie in blam-
ing others for your own -

sores nor in isolating yourself.
We'd better

learn from a tree how to be in
touch with winds

and how to grow without bend-
ing to a seasonal wind. Then as
we

might open Korean Cultural .
Centers in any city

of the U.S., why can’t the
Americans open theirs here?

The vacant building of the
Americans Cultural Center

in the heart of Kwangju City,
drearier than ever,

utters monosyllables in metallic
voice, hardly

understood, closing its iron-
barred gate

and two padlocks as a visitor
goes out.

Ghost Words from a |

Inside Art |

Peruvian Lover |

You have been dismantled into
segments

A doll’s smile, ferret eyes, hair
strewn in

Garlands and song as you
floated in night

Like fey Ophelia. Bits and
broken pieces

Fill the blue interstices dividing
sighs

Into invisible tragedy
Disappearing across aeons and
galaxies

Scattered; you have been flung
like

A rag to the winds.

—J.M. Gillikin, ‘89

Moving

still I hang suspended, this
(one of many memories) cathedral’s.ancight stone
warmed, and atmosphere of dusty sun
dancing motes

through st. francis’ stained glass eyes
are still

not dead, but dreaming i
d light as sunset scarlet

streams alive and dancing through his a
each a complement that thinly braided
segmented glass (i am the dappled doe
that licks hi¢ hand), his benediction falls
like curls upon my upturned face, attentive
squinting

n hair

bright, green stained grass kissed his toe
for centuries have stood, new morning dfw
each on each, pieces, hand cut light
placed carefully in leaden outline makin
whole

shines, the purple breasted birds around his haloed head,
the brown and scratching hairshirt
on his skin, feeling each is each is
peace, pieces of the people we have onand
past my window, orange shines throughpright
my soul, st francis

dreaming still and still remember each
(certain broken colors, bits of bottle glas
edges smoothed, upon the beach) .
