THE DAVIDSONIAN

The Wildcats last went to the NCAA Tournament in 1986, when
Gerry Born (seen celebrating above) hit a last-second jumper to
knock off UT-Chattanooga in the Southern Conference title game.
This year's squad hopes to be part of a similar scene Sunday.

Kosmalski fits right in, already a power in SC

By MIcHAEL Kruse
Sports Editor

On most nights, the men’s bas-
ketball team faces opponents that
are quicker and stronger, blessed
with greater raw athletic ability.

The rookie

But the Wildcats, under coach
Bob McKillop, have nonetheless
become a perennial contender in
the. Southern Conference’s upper
echelon, relying ona slightly higher
level of intensity and concentra-
tion, and playing with controlled
abandon.

Funda-
mentals and
discipline
" have allowed
| them toearna
reputationasa
team whose
success rou-
tinely tran-
scends the sta-
tistical productivity ofits individual
parts.

This in mind, it’s tough toimag-
ine a player better suited to the
Davidson system than freshman
Landry Kosmalski.

As a 6-foot-7, 215-lb. power
forward, Kosmalski simply does not

- have the body to physically domi-

nate his man.

~~» ~«Wethe manages to gain an edge

much more often than not.

“When I was growing up, we’d |

have the same team over the sum-
mer,” Kosmalski explained in an

interview earlier this month. “We
weren’treally that athletic and we’d
always be playing these athletic
teams.

“I kind of learned that you’re
not going to be jumping and getting
rebounds with them so you learn to
box out. You’re not going to be
going by them so you learn to use
your body.”

And in doing so, Kosmalski _

has averaged 13.1 points and 7.9
rebounds per game in his rookie
campaign. He stands as a heavy
favorite for league Freshman-of-
the-Year honors going into this
week’s conference tournament at
the Greensboro Coliseum.

His statistics, impressive at any
rate - his rebounding clip is second
in the Southern and his scoring 15th
-don’teven really indicate just what
kind of impact this 18-year-old
Beford, Texas, native has had on
Davidson and the rest of the confer-
ence,

While you’d expect a rookie to
pad his stats against weaker oppo-
nents in relatively meaningless
games, Kosmalski has actually
logged his finest performances when
the team needed him most.

Case in point: the best effort of
his career came in a tight 63-58 win
over The Citadel Jan. 27 in Charles-
ton, S.C., a contest in which he
recorded 24 points and 15 boards on
a night when the other four Wildcat
starters had uncharacteristically
poor games.

“Landry has been a constant,”
McKillop said that night. “He’s as
tough as they come, freshman,
sophomore, junior, or senior.”

But even with this flurry of

early success, Kosmalski is not one
to pat himself on the back.

Ask him about high school ac-
complishments, and he’ll tell you
about his 31-4 Trinity squad that
went to the Texas state final, not his
all-state second team and academic
first team ‘selections.

Talk to him after a game in
which he scores a lot, he’ll say he

‘needs to rebound more. And after a

game in which he rebounds enough,
he will say he needs to score more.

Rarely - if ever - is he satisfied.
He will always find something he
didn’t do perfectly - a lesson he
learned from his father, Len, who
starred at Tennessee and then played
in the NBA for the Kansas City
Kings and Chicago Bulls.

“He told me, that when he got
to the NBA, he kind of got content
and then he got cut,” said the
younger Kosmalski. “When he fig-
ured out he was about to get cut, he
started playing well. But by then, it
was too late.

“T learned in high school that if
you get content, you’re going to go
out and not practice as hard and
then you’re not going to play as
hard,” he said. “I don’t want to get
too happy with myself. Everything
can change so quickly.”

Right now though, Kosmalski
is a big part Davidson will travel up
I-85 to Greensboro as a real threat
to win the event and the NCAA bid
that goes along with it. —

“You can’t ask for anything
more froma freshman,” noted Mark
Donnelly earlier this month. “I’ve
saiditall year, he’s the reason we’re
a lot better than people thought we
were going to be.”

powerhouse. The Wildcats have
accepted NIT bids two of the last
three seasons, McKillop earning
conference Coach-of-the-Year hon-
ors in both those campaigns,

“T think we’ve made our state-
ment. This program’s been built
the right way,” said McKillop last
Friday. “This is a tremendous prod-
uct.”

Indeed. And his sideline wiz-
ardry is even more remark-
able given Davidson’s status
as the nation’s smallest Divi-
sion I college.

At a school whose aca-
demic standards leave little
room for timely junior col-
lege transfers, this year’s 17-
9 record is amazing after the
departure of four starters and
two other lettermen from last
se@son’s 25-5 team.

That is where the coach-
ing comes in.

McKillop has molded a
team of young, inexperienced
players with just two veterans to
form acorps very capable of captur-
ing the league tournament title this
weekend in Greensboro.

McKillop, a genuinely humble
man, is quick to credit his assistants
Steve Shurina, Matt Matheny, and
Jason Zimmerman before himself.

His players, however, give

‘credit where it is due.

“I want to play well for him
whenever Iam onthe court,” Landry
Kosmalski said recently, granting
perhaps the greatest compliment a
player can give a coach.

McKillop’s impact on this par-
ticular group is most noticeable by
the team’s nonpareil work ethic.
He is a motivator who preaches
hard work, efficiency, and disci-
pline, and wants nothing more than
to see his players overcome the nec-
essary obstacles.

Players consistenly arrive well

before practice to work on various
parts of their game. They do it at
this late juncture of the season just
like back in September.

After a tough loss to South

Division champ UT-Chattanooga ~

in January, guard Jeff Bergmann
was out on the court twenty minutes
after the game feeding passes to
redshirt junior Ben Ebong.

“That demonstrates the com-
mitment these players have,” said
McKillop at the time.

His players carry themselves
well on and off the court, frequently
going out into the greater Charlotte
community to speak to younger chil-
dren, another reflection of
McKillop’s positive influence as a
mentor for not only basketball, but
life as well.

On the court, there is no brash
showboating or trash-talking. Just
solid, fundamental basketball.

McKillop has guided this
team to success without the
strongest or quickest indi-
viduals, but rather by teach-
ing exactly what it is to be a
team.

“Tome, there is no greater
reward than seeing a team
come together,” said
McKillop. “They’ve all
managed tohelp each other.”

Whether or not Davidson
wins the tourney this week-
end, one thing is for sure:
McKillop will have his team
perched atop the league
standings for a long, long time.

“I just wish that our players
would get the support that they have
earned,” he added. “‘That’s the only
thing that can allow our program to

‘take the next step.”

That, and McKillop.
