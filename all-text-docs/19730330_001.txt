LETTING OFF STEAM

The fire department and a few hundred students turned out shor-
tly after 6 p.m. last Tuesday behind Belk Dormitory to watch a
head of steam rise from a broken pipe valve. Although Belk had
no hot water Tuesday evening as a consequence, by Wednesday

night the valve had been repaired.

Faculty Refers Honors College
Proposal To EPC For Study

By BOB HOWELL
Managing Editor

A proposal which would ter-
minate the Honors College as it
now exists has been referred by
the faculty to the Educational
Policy Committee (EPC) tor
further study.

Presented to the faculty at its
last meeting before spring
break. the proposal recom-
mends abolishing the Honors
College as a separate institution
while incorporating = facilities
for honors level work into the
regular college curriculum

“Tos would put much more
responsibility upon the oon
dividual departinents at tne
college aad would open up (he

A Council of Honors Studies
would coordinate for the entire
college the kinds of programs
now conducted within the
Honors College

The present: Honors College
building would be renamed the
Center for Honors Studies. ser-
Ving as the basic facility of ac-
tivibes invelving honors stu-
dents and housing the office of a

“Examining the situation
that presently exists—its dit

felt that: everybody expressed
some desire to) broaden tie
scope of honors level work at
Davidson.” said Kelton. “but at
seems the structure ot the
Honors College hasa't been able
to do tins

“We hope that we can retain

the benetits of the Honors
College experiment while
