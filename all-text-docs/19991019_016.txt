Wildcats stun Georgetown for biggest victory in decades

By J. D. LARAMorRE & MIKE ANDERSON
Staff Writers

It’s already been lauded as perhaps the most
stunning victory on the gridiron in Davidson’s
storied history of college football.

The 28-27 victory in Washington D.C. marked
the Wildcats first victory over a Division I-AA
opponent since 1992. And it wasn’t against just
any I-AA team; the Hoyas finished second last
year in national coaches’ polls of I-AA non-schol-
arship football programs. Furthermore, the Hoyas
(undefeated until Saturday) had not lost a home
game since November 22, 1997.

Georgetown pounced to a 27-7 lead, before
Tim Landis injected freshman quafterback Paul
Nichols into the Wildcats’ sputtering option at-
tack. Assisted by some miraculous defensive and
special teams efforts, Nichols engineered a heroic
comeback that will be forever etched in the annals
of Wildcat football history.

The Wildcats’

free when the ball fumbled out of his grip into the
hands of an oncoming Hoya. Just seconds later,
Georgetown had again punched the ball into the
Wildcat end zone, extending their lead to 27-7.

The scoring seemed to slow to a half over the
third quarter, with the Hoyas nursing a comfort-
able three-touchdown lead.

But Tim Landis’s Wildcats needed a spark;
instead, he found an explosion ina 5’ 11” freshman
quarterback named Paul Nichols. Dubbed by radio
broadcaster Frank Santore as “The Demon of
Dunwoody,” Nichols mounted a 99-yard touch-
down drive in his first possession on the afternoon.

The 99-yard scoring drive cut the deficit to
14, and the ’Cats attempted an on-side kick. That
Davidson was unable to recover the kick proved
inconsequential as Ryan Crawford leapt in front of
Hoya tight end Reid Wakefield for a clutch inter-
ception on the Hoyas’ first play from scrimmage.

The offense took over at their own 18-yard
line, and Nichols again delivered an impressive

then J.J. Mont and the

Georgetown place kicker Paul Wiorowski missed
an extra point try in the first quarter, a gaff that
would come back to haunt him later that day.
The Wildcats were equally impotent on both
sides of the line of scrimmage in the first half, only
managing to enter Hoya territory on a few scarce
occasions over the first two quarters.
Quarterback Shaun Tyrance (10-23 passing
for 93 yards) was unable to string together a
scoring drive until late in the first half, when he
marshaled the ’Cats down field, completing passes
to Corey Crawford, Marcus McFadden, and Roland
Williams. Senior Eric Ferguson capped off the
scoring drive with an | 1-yard run, cutting the half-
time deficit to 20-7.

The second half commenced in a fashion
frustratingly similar to the first. Corey Crawford

‘Nichols carried the ball in himself from 3 yards

out, diminishing the deficit to 27-21.

Once again, the Wildcats lined up for a des-
peration on-side kick. On what has been dubbed
“the Immaculate bounce,” Davidson was able to
scoop up the squiggling pigskin. The recovery
armed Nichols and the Wildcat offense with one
final chance to orchestrate an epic upheaval of the
national powerhouse.

With 1:48 left to play, the Wildcat offense
needed just five plays to score the game-tying
touchdown. The day’s other first-year hero, kicker
Daniel Hanks, continued his perfect string of extra
point attempts to put the Wildcats up 28-27 (their
only lead of the day).

Georgetown’s final hopes at repressing the
surging Wildcat tide were vested in a desperation
52-yard field goal attempt. The kick sailed wide
left, and the Wildcats sealed the stunning upset.

Offensive lineman Andy
Countryman had high words of
praise for the upstart quarterback:
“Nichols came in and just took con-
trol of the game.” Coach Tim Landis
agreed, “[Nichols] exemplified tre-
mendous poise on the field.”

Utilizing a fast-paced ap-
proach to keep the Hoya defense
disoriented and on their heels,
Nichols pounded the ball down-
field time and time again. The fresh-
man showed remarkable poise and
pleasant humility on the afternoon.
“The receivers just came down with
the ball when I put it out there. I’
went in and just tried to do what I
was supposed to do.”

“He went out there and took
advantage of what they gave him,”

“We were confident at the
half that we could win and we
showed that in the second half,”
said junior lineman Matt Hurt.

“This season takes a big turn
now. It brings a new perspective
to our season,” Nichols said after
the game.

“Let’s stop and play
Randolph Macon (next week’s
opponent) on.the way home,”
Landis reveled.

The ’99 edition of the Wild-
cat football squad has endured
some doubts and less-than-flat-
tering comparisons to the °98
record-breaking squad. Perhaps
the Davidson squad heard the
words of President Clinton echo-
ing through the air in our nation’s
capital: “We have heard the trum-
pets, we have changed the guard.
And now, each in our own way,
and with God’s help, we must
answer.”

Whatever the inspiration,
Saturday’ s landmark performance
assured the ’99 Wildcats a place
all their own in the record books.
