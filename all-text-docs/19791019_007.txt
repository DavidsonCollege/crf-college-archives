Runners take

European meet

By VAN BECK
Staff Writer

The Davidson men’s cross
country team, paced by sopho-
more John Hoots, whipped
three visiting schools this past
Saturday in winning the second
annual European Cross Country
meet. The meet, which included
Davidson, Campbell, Georgia
State and UNCC, was expected
to be very close but the Cats
romped to victory by placing
five runners in the top thirteen.

Davidson’s women also com-
peted Saturday; they faced
Berry and Georgia State in a
tri-meet which was run as a part
of the European cross country
festival. The lady Cats placed
second in the competition, de-
feating Georgia State but losing
to Berry.

Cool, overcast weather and a
muddy course with numerous
barriers and water jumps were
considered ideal conditions for
‘‘European’’ cross ‘country.
IMAC Commandant Sterling
Martin did an excellent job in
giving the Davidson course a
European look.

For the second consecutive
week Hoots led Davidson’s
effort. Hoots, who was nipped
by Campbell’s Carl Ivarson for
the individual title, seems final-
ly to have shaken his ‘‘up then
down” racing reputation of a
year ago. Jeff Morrow finished
in third place overall, 18 se-
conds behind Hoots.

Morrow had been the pre-race
favorite because of his hill-
running and steeple-chasing a-
bilities but was unable to close
the gap between himself and the
two leaders after Hoots strung
out the pack with a sizzling
mile-and-a-half split. Bart Lan-
dess, Greg Burnard, and Terry
Morrow rounded out David-
son’s top five. :

The final results of the meet
show Davidson with 36 points,
Campbell 52, and Georgia State
67, while UNCC’s 49ers strug-
gled home with 71. The opposi-
tion could have fared worse had
veteran George Strobel not been
taking the LSAT Saturday
morning or had sophomores
Danny Armistead and John
Robertson been able to run.

Saturday’s meet saw the
Wildcat harriers run their dual
meet record to 7-5°f8r,'79 with
only the NC-State mget and the
Southern Coniference..Champi-

-onships remainihg--Since these
competitions do not count to-
the cross country team is as:
sured of a winning season.

Susan Davidson captured the
individual title in the women’s
5000 meter race with a fine
20:44 clocking. Her finish was
not enough for Davidson to
win the competition, however,

as Berry College utilized team

depth to win the meet. Carrie
Nunn and Merris Hollingsworth
also finished well-for Davidson,
placing seventh and eighth

respectively.

Director of Housing tells all to Band BB

By BONEHEAD and
THE BRICK BROTHERS
Hello, we are Bonehead
and the Brick Brothers, your
new IMAC reporters. What
does IMAC mean? Nobody ever
told us. Do you know what
IMAC means? We think it
means, ‘‘I munch and chew.”

Plato said it meant ‘‘Isoscles’

methinks arpeggio measly,”’
but it was later shown that he
was wrong. Joby says it means
“IT made another C.”’ No matter
what you think IMAC means,
enjoy it for it may not be here
tomorrow.

This week as an IMAC

- special we will interview Bob

Building, our new student how-
sing director. Everthing revea-
led in this interview is confiden-
tial and therefore we hope that
you will not repeat what you
read.

B and BB; Tell us how you like
your job so far?

BOB: Well, you know, I guess
it's all-right as far as occupa-
tions go. I don't really like
where my office is though. The
Freshmen in Belk are so stupid
and I can hardly get into the
office because of the beds in the
television lounge.

Band BB: There does seem to
be a housing problem.

BOB: The administration has
assured.me that there is not.
We expect a larger freshman
class next year and so we will
have new dorms by 1994.
B and BB: What about next
year?

BOB: The plan is to build lofts
in the bathrooms. We will also
put six people in a room with
two beds. The students will
sign up for sleeping schedules in
the regular drop-add procedure.
Burts says it will not conflict
with lab times.

B and BB: Do you really think
that the urinals in Richardson
are necessary?

BOB: Well, Iam new to campus

but my first impression would
be yes.

Band BB: What about the pink
shower curtains in Watts?
BOB: The Queens girls really
seem to get off on them.

B and BB: We have. always
been intrigued by the fact that
the showers in Duke are onty
four feet high and the toilets are
six inches off the ground.
BOB: The dorm was planned
during the summer when camp
children were here and I guess
they got confused about the size
of the students. It was a good
thing since Percy and Mouse
were there last year.

B and BB: Why does it get so
hot in the dorms in the winter?
BOB: It was calculated that it
is cheaper to heat the rooms to
200 degrees for seven minutes
rather than to keep them at 60
degrees continuously.

Band BB: Thanks for your time

and good luck becausé you will -

need it.

Now for last week’s games:
KA#1 bounced back after a
scare from the East Men to
swallow ARA 61-0. John Jack-
son became the leading scoring
rusher for the season with nine

points. He downed the tailback _

for a safety and intercepted a
long pass and ran it back for the
score. Teams should take note
of the KA 378936 defense in
which the rusher drops back to
cover the offensive ends.
Hurtin for Certin squeaked

past ARA. SAE ran by PAX:

80-0. The Old Men kissed off
the Caribou Lips 13-6 to regain
some respectability. Born to
Run nipped the Islanders 21-20
and beat. Our Meet 39-0. PIKA
sunk the Yachting Club 32-6.
The East Men are beginning
to show signs that they came to
Davidson to play ball. Ken
Murrough led the youngsters to
a 25-20 victory over the Warks.
Reckless Abandon pounded the

SPEs 38-0 in a game that
Hoopla asked us not to report.
In the women’s league there
were four forfeits.
That is all for this week.
Have you hugged your room-
mate today? Later.

Field hockey

tests Duke

By ROB MOORE
_ Staff Writer.
After a couple of disappoin-
ting losses, the Davidson field

hockey team has gained mo-

mentum with an upset of Duke
last Saturday. After a scoreless
first half, the Wildcats were
able to rally for two second half
goals while a strong defense
held Duke to only one. The Cats
first goal was. put in by Lisa
Ballantyne with an assist by
Amy Crittenberger. The second
goal was scored on an unassis-
ted shot by Carol Heppner.
**Although they weren’t as
strong this year as in the past,
it's always an upset when we .
beat Duke,’’ commented Susan.
Roberts, the field hockey coach.
“We've beaten two Divison I
‘schools, but have problems
beating schools in our own divi-
sion.”
Davidson takes a 3-4 record
into this week which included a

‘game against Catawba yester-

day. Other foes this week are
.Furman October 18 at Furman
and a home game against the
North Carolina club team Octo-
ber 21.

The field hockey team, does
not compete in a conference race
as most teams at Davidson, but
competes with five other
for a state Division II title. The
champion is decided by a tour-
nament held November 1-2.
Although coach Roberts says
the team is not looking ahead to
the tournament, she feels confi-
dent about their chances.

“We've lost to two of the -
teams in the division, both by

‘one goal. We controlled both

games but got careless. They
got the breaks to win. We
definitely have the capability to
win if ‘we can put it all

Jack Smith shows Davidson's winning form.
