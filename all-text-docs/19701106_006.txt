‘To Test "Cat Defense

By ERNIE SHIPE

Rich McKay and ‘Mark
Thompson have a lot in
common, *

For two seasons both
these quarterbacks spent
their Saturday afternoons
on the bench watching either
Ed Baker or Gordon Slade

‘work his way to every school

passing record.

Like Thompson, Baker has
finally found a chance ito
play and in the process is
approaching all the Lafay-
ette passing records set by
Baker who was figned by
the New York Giants last
year.

Tomorrow Thompson and
McKay will see what they
can do against each other as
the Wildcats face Lafay-
ette at 2 p.m. in Richardson
Stadium.

Lafayette is fresh from a

Fagg Declares New Season

By A. W. TURNER
Asst. Sports Editor
Davidson's football team
is unbeaten and untiéd this

season.

‘Head coach Dave: Fagg
and his squad declared a
new sSéason after the loss to
Wofford, and the Wildcats
began that second season
this year with a convincing
55-21 thrashing of VJM.I.

Fagg was understandably
orilled with the win, the
first for: the ‘Caitts since the
opening victory over Rich-
mond.

_.'We-had a lot. of good .

things happen to us, ex-
plained Fagg. ‘‘We got ahead
and made VJM.I. play catch-
up. We made less mistakes
than we have been mak-
ing.”’

‘Fagg cited Hugh Dennis,
Nick Dumich, Mark Thomp-
son, Johnny Ribet, Mike
Mikolayunas, and-Bill Brac-
ken as being instrumental
in leading Davidson. The
win broke a four game loss
skid.

Ribet attributed the offen-
sive explosion to a more

Wildcats Finish Twelfth
In Cross-Country Meet

By HAL CANTER
Sports Writer

‘Davidson's cross-country
team came in 12th with a
total of 350 points in the
North Carolina State Meet
ast Monday at Raleigh:

(Davidson Coach Sterling
Martin said that it was
an ‘‘outstanding ~ race.” He
added, ‘“‘Duke had the
, edge.'’ Duke University and
tthe. University of North
Carolina have taken first
‘and second places respec-
tively for the past two years
in the meet.

Martin was surprised that
North Carolina State Uni-
versity finished third. but
they had an excellent run-
er. ‘I expected East Caro-
lina to be stronger,’’ Martin
ep erat fo

“Riven though Duke was.

far . ahead in the running
and the Wildcats were con-
fronted with’. outstanding
competition, our boys ran
well,”’ Martin said.

Waldrop of the University
of North Carolina finished

first in the race with a. time -

_of 25:11, The course record
which was. set in 1967 is
25:06.

Coach Martin added. that

Waldrop came from behind
to pass the‘lead men of Duke
and clinch first place for
U.N.C,

‘Howard Boyd ran a fine
race with a time of 29:10.
Joe Shibley, who has” im-
proved greatly over the
season, ran a 29:39. Mike
Butits finished third for Da-
vidson in 30:45. Richard
Fort finished in 30:46 and
Ran Coble came in with
31:32.

The Wildtats will travel
to Lexington, Va. Nov. 16 to
run in the Southern Confer-
ence meet. Martin feels sure
that William and Mary will
take first place at the meet.

He added that Furman,
The Citadel, and East Caro-
lina wilt be running close
for second place. The possi-
bility of V.M.I. taking third

balaftced attack. ‘‘We ran
more against V.M.1.,"’ he
said. ‘‘They were ready for

our sweeps, sO we ran up
the middle most of the
time.” .

Ribet had high praise for
the offensive linemen. ‘‘The
line opened up big holes,
and the tackles did a great
job of downfield blocking."’

He was also optimistic
about the future, comment-
ing that the jmproving run-
ning game would help the
Davidson passing attack.

‘Dennis was also very hap-

py.: A defensive tackle, he ~

was pleased with the Wild-
cat defenders, who held the
Keydets to a field goal in
the first half. —

“Putting the first part of
our schedule aside really
helped us,” he stated. ‘The
two things that helped us
get prepared for V.M.I. most

were the declaration of the _

new season, and some real
hard practices the week be-
fore the game.”

Dennis pointed to better
tackling as the key to the
defensive performance. ‘‘We
didn’t miss all the tackles
that we did in our four
losses,"’ he explained.

Dennis said that a com-
bination of the wet field and
the fact that V.M.I. got be-
hind eanly caused..the. Key-
dets to throw the ball a lot.
He cited the defensive back-
field as having responded to
ithis challenge well,
pointed: to Dumich as the

burg. The Leopards (from
Easton, Pa.) own a 3-5 re-
cord for the season and play
in the Middle Atlantic Con-
ference where they are 1-2.

McKay is 355 yards away
from Baker’s single season
passing mark ‘with three
games remainifig. The senior
quarterback from New York
City has passed for 1095
yards, ‘completing 70 of 152
passes.

McKay was instrumental
in the Leopards’ win over
Gettysburg last Saturday
rifling 54 and 58 yard touch-
down passés in the second

if.

Offensive line coach Turn-
ley Todd compared Lafay-
ette with Bucknell. ‘They
are the same size defensive-
ly as Bucknell and they hit
like mad. The team’s speed
is a little better than aver-
age. ” &

Lafayette barely lost to
Bucknell earlier in the sea-
son, 30-28. Bucknell downed
the Wildcats, 21-20.

Todd explained that the
Leopards run out of a full-I
and slot-I. Tailback Tom
Conway is called on to do
most of the rushing. The
180 pound sophomore has
picked up 257 yards on 79
carries for a 3.2 average.
Conway. was called on io
carry 22 times against Get-
tysburg.

Although.. he.. is. better
known as a receiver, flanker
Bob Donofrio has the best
rushing mark. He has pick-
ed up 5.9 yards per carry,
gaining 382 yards on 65 at-
tempts.

The 5-9, 170 pound senior
is one of McKay’s favorite
targets as he’s caught 26
passes for 528 yards. Join-
ing them in the backfield
is fullback Peter Tonks.

The leading pass receiver
for the Leopards is Rick
‘Nowell. The 6-3 split end has

snared 30 passes fir 529
yards,
Nowell’s relief, Darrell

Johnson, is a threat as well.

“Against Gettysburg he haul-

ed in three passes for 102
yards. John Summers lines-

ards, as

On defense the Leopards

alternate between a 4-3 and
5-2. Defensive end and line-
backer John Bourgher is the
man to watch. The 215 pound
senior has been tabbed for
post season recognition.

Head Coach Harry Gam-
ble said. before the season
that the key to Lafayette’s
success would be .improve-
ment of the defense.

'Cats Take Fourth
At Charleston

The Davidson sailing team
placed fourth out of six en-
trants in an invitational re-
gatta at the College of Char-
leston Oct. 31.

The regatta was hamper-
ed by. flood conditions in the
Cooper River and extremely
strong winds, according to
Jith Hunter, skipper of the
A division boat.

Hunter said he felt the
team: had not sailed up to,
their potential in any of the
regattas this season.

Hunter skippered the ,A
division boat all five races
with ‘Mark Leonard serving
as crewman in the first four
and Doug Brown in the fifth.

Richard Currry skippered
the first four races in the B
division, with Andy Trahern
as crew, and Trahern pilot-
ed the fifth with Roger Man-
ley as crew.

The Wildcat skippers
placed behind The Citadel,
The College of Charleston,
The University of South
Carolina and ahead of Geor-
gia Tech and The University
of Tennessee. ‘

This week the _ sailors
travel to Tennessee for their
fourth conference regatta.

Hunter stated that he felt
the Wildcats could do no
worse than third at Tenne-
see, though he would not
comment beyond that.
