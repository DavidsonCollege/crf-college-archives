Director Smith uses an anal-
ogy to explain the program. “It
(the program) takes these young
men to the top of the mountain
of success for a brief look. in
order that they might know what
is there. It then brings then
back to the bottom of the moun-
tain and challenges them to
climb." Smith said.

George Penick. one of the
freshmen selected. said ‘It’s an
opportunity to write a blank
check for anything the individ-
ual feels he can do. It is devel-
oped by the students rather than
by some heirarchy and its suc-
cess will depend on what they
do with the program."

In outlining the program Kirk
Reed, student member of the se-
lection committee, places strong '
emphasis on the advantages that

The journalist presented Viet-
nam and the war there as a
country and a_ conflict full of
contrasts. In five minutes, one
can travel from the jungle to a
French restaurant in Saigon.

In the delta area it is the job
of the Marines to protect the
peasants and among the Mon-
tagnardo natives in the highland
areas they carry out what Arm
strong termed “kindness pa
trols.” But with the First Cav
alry division around An Khe.
success is measured by fhe num-
ber of casualties.

Armstrong has spent most of
his time in Vietnam with U. S.
troops and has witnessed many
types of operations. He charac-
terized the conflict as a war
that “has no front, no rear.”
Battles spring up spontaneously
due to the rapid movement of
the enemy Viet Cong forces.

Calling the men serving there
“the most intelligent. the most
aggressive and the most adap-
table” fight forces that Amer-
ica has ever had, Armstrong
cited the necessity of these qual-
ities in fighting the Viet Cong.
Fighting the Viet Cong is like
“fighting a will o° the wisp, a
shadow,”’ he said.

The biggest problem with the
VC is that they wear no uni-
forms, Armstrong indicated.
Even the most innocent-looking
woman may be a Viet Cong
agent. Another problem is that
the Viet. Cong are hard to spot
in the thick jungle.

In a country where most of
the roads have been torn up or
mined, Armstrong said that
transportation is very difficult.

To deal with this problem. heli-
copters are widely used. Giving
a specific instance. Armstrong
said that the First Cavalry divi-
sion is using about 500 choppers
which give them the mobbility
needed for attacking the elusive
vc.

Armstrong told of the counter
