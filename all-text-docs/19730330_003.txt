EPC Okays Language Course

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Asst. Managing Editor

A proposal for a more ex-
tensive language program tor
Davidson College was approved
Tuesday by the Education
Policy Committee Vice
President tor Academic Attairs
Jonn M. Bevan submitted the
proposal which is to begin next
fall

The program, winch will in-
clude those languages not
usually offered in the college
curricula, will be supervised
and) coordinated by an ap-
pointed director. Foreign ex-
change students at Davidson and
professors from here and trom
other schools will tutor” par-
ticipants in the program

“The primary goal of selt-
instructional language pro-
grams is the basic mastery
of oral skills equivalent to one
or more years of formal in-
struction.” stated Bevan in-his
proposal

He hopes that Davidson can
work with the Center for
Critical Languages at the State
University of New York at Bul-

falo. Almost 50 colleges and
universities are enrolled in the
program now

Bevan emphasized that the
course would take at least as
much time as a regular class
Since the program is) done
almost entirely by — selt-
instruction, students will have
to exercise a great deal of sell-
discipline

Students will be selected by a
screening process consisting ot
the Modern Language Aptitude
Test: a review of previous
language study pertormance.
recommendations from
teachers. advisors, and coun-
selors; and finally a personal
interview.

Bevan does not: expect: an
overwhelming, reaction to the
program. “Il would anticipate
six or eight fellows really
working.” he commented. The
Vice-President: added that he
hoped the program would *dove-
tail” into an intensive summer
program

Students would be expected to
buy or rent a small. cassett tape
recorder which they could use
Instead of having to spend se

much time in the Language
Lab This would eliminate the
need for upkeep of tapes and
handling of materials

Tutors recruited from among
the foreign exchange students
at Davidson will work with par-
ticipants for 10-15 hours” per
week. In return for their ser-
vices they will receive between
$2.50 and -$3.00 per) one-hour
tutorial session. Also. native
speakers from the general
Davidson vicmity may be used

An unusual aspect) of the
program is) the methods ot
testing proposed. Students may
visit. their examiner on_ his
home campus. or the examiner
can do the travelling. Another
possibility is for individual
tests to be given via long dis-
tance telephone

Among the several languages
suggested for the program are
basic and intermediate
Japanese

There seems to be little op-
position to the Sell-Instructional
Language program. “IT don't
see any major problem.” said
Bevan
