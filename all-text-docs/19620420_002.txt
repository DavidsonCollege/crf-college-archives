Religion And Education

The essence of education is that it be religious .

- an. education which

inevleates duty and reverence. Duty arises from our potential control over the
course of events. Where attainable knowledge would have changed the issue,
ignorance has the guilt of vice. And the foundation of reverence is this perception,
that the present holds within Itself the complete sum of existence, backwards
and forwards, the whole amplitude of time, which is eternity.

In the history of education, the most striking phenomenon is that schools
of learning, which at one epoch are alive with a ferment of genius, in a succeeding
generation exhibit mere pedantry and routine. The reason is, that they are
overladen with inert ideas. Education with inert ideas is not only useless: it is,
above all things, harmful — Corruptio optimi, pessima. Except at rare intervals of
intellectual ferment, education in the past has been radically infected with inert

ideas. .

« Every intellectual revolution which has ever stirred humanity into

greatness has been a passionate protest against inert ideas. Then, alas, with
pathetic ignorance of human psychology, it has proceeded by some educational
scheme to bind humanity afresh with inert ideas of its own fashioning.

The rumbles, ramblings and hard
labor .of.reform in Davdson’s curricu-
culum have emanated this spring from
faculty and administration offices.
The history of these reforms is that of
all decisive reform here: “Wait and
see. If it. works somewhere else, we'll
try it.” Regardless of histories. we
are happy about the new Humanities
course, and the general trend toward
seminar and tutorial work at the up-
perclass level.

_ But curriculum reform is not by
any means the whole story in David-
son's long-needed battle against inert
ideas, methods, and policies. Two com-
mencements ago, a possibly over-frank
and misunderstood valedictorian said,
in part: “We have-too seldom encoun-
tered here the liberating spirit of edu-
cation and vibrant, acted Christian
faith. We should depart having either
accepted or rejected the search for
Truth and commitment to the Chris-
ian God. We do depart having accept-
ed or rejected neither; we depart with-
out the knowledge of what search and
commitment are.”

A liberating ‘spirit of education
and an acted, uniquely individual
Faith will result from a_ profound
change in attitude and approach—a
change much more subtle than any

THE AIMS OF EDUCATION, 1916)

heralded revolution in course offer-
ings. It involves such ambiguities as
Vespers and assembly -requirements,
these considered in the context of the

pressing question: what ‘is to be the .

nature of a purportedly liberal arts
college which also attempts to ‘incul-
cate distinctly Christian attitudes.

We believe at least part of the
problem at Davidson lies in our glar-
ing lack of a well defined, consistent-
ly applied philosophy of education.
Like most colleges, we also suffer
from a false compartmentalization of
knowledge, ‘usually resulting not in
the dissemination of wisdom, but in a
blind, almost idolatrous faith in one
narrow area of knowledge.

The Christian liberal. arts col-
lege can and should be far more ex-
perimental and prophetically creative
than a state supported school is free
to be. We need to face honestly
questions of our ideals and means.
t is inconsistent to encourage the ask-
ing of urgent, profound questions
about ultimate answers with one hand,
while encouraging a blind, unquestion-
ing pietism with the other. Just be-
cause we bear its label, we need not
reflect an_ ecclesiastical institution
which is often more a reflection of
“the system” than judge of it, or pro-
phet ‘in it:

Another Step Forward?

Professor Robert Lord; in his
recent chapel address, recommended
that Davidson add to its curriculum
a program allowing seniors to do an
independent research project. In
other schools the program is set up
somewhat like this. A few qualified
rising seniors are selected by the
faculty to develop an independent re-
search project their senior year, with-
out having to meet any other require-
ments. At the end’ of the year. they
submit a report of their project.

This is a program worthy of a
School that seeks to be the best liberal
arts college for 1000 students in the
country. The new Humanities course’
to be offered next year is a Step
toward this goal. However, it will take
many such steps to reach such a goal.

urthermore, to remain at the’ top
will be a continuous struggle of con-
Stantly seeking progressive changes

and improvements. This senior re-
search program would be a valuable
part of a complete program of liberal
arts education.

_ _ Perhaps for those students who

find the “transfer process” in their
regular classes boring or even for
those students whose needs the
Honors program does not meet, this
program will be the answer. It is like-
ly that such students may be poten-
tially the best students, only needing
something that is really meaningful
and challenging to them to awaken
their latent ability.

The most significant aspect of a
college education is a self-develop-
ment that does not end with one’s four

years of college. The senior research.

program would, provide a unique
means of stimulating that self-de-
velopment.

Needed: Able Leadership

.. Asuccession of names, The Dav-
idson College Magazine, The Chame-
leon, and Ye Yowl, gives only a slight
indication of the chaotic heritage of
today’s Scripts ‘n’ Pranks. In one form
or another the campus magazine has
risen and fallen with almost cyclic
regularity.

Student interest, or lack of inter-
est, has played the major part in its
history. In the past, whenever the
magazine had the popular support of
the student body, it was good. When-
ever it became “that magazine pro-
duced by those Students,” as it has in
recent years, the outcome of each
forthcoming issue was dubious.

The creation of a new adviso
board is a good move toward tap ing
all the available sources of talent on
campus but it should not be looked

on as a cure-all. Each freshman class
demonstrates that we do have tremen-
dous potential, some of which will
probably not be touched on by the ad-
visory board’s efforts.

; A renaissance of student advisory
ing and identification with the maga-
zine will only be brought about by
effective leadership from within. We
feel that the importance of the present
election of editor cannot be overem-
phasized. We hope that all students
will seriously consider the candidates
and their statements and vote on the
basis of ability and energy.

Next year will be the 100th an-
niversary of the existence of a college
magazine at Davidson. We have a
right to expect a development of
Scripts ‘n’ Pranks into something that
can be compared to the best.

Wellford Defends

BY HARRISON WELLFORD

Former Honor Court Chairman

EDITOR'S NOTE: The views
presented: below are wholly
those of the author and do
not represent necessarily the
official opinion of the Honor
Court.

“Justly to discriminate, firm-
ly to establish, wisely to pre-
scribe, and honestly to award —
these are the true aims of criti-
cism.” (Simms)

Contrary to what appears to
be the popular conception at
Davidson, I would propose that
neither praise nor blame is the
object of. true criticism. Criti-
cism, instead, is meant as a
standard of judging well, in
terms suggested by the quota-
tion above. In some circles re-
cently, there has been criti-
cism of Honor Court procedure
that I feel has not measured up
to this standard of judgment. I
wish to make a reply that hope-
fully will vlarify some of the
matters in question.

First, there hes been criti-
cism of the clandestine nature
of Court procedure. It is as-
serted that the Court keeps its
mode of ‘operation, particular-
ly trials, too much within its
own circle. a

I would answer first that the
Court has published in THE
DAVIDSONIAN complete infor.
mation about its procedural
techniques and that this infor-
mation was presented in chapel
in the fall of. last year. Second-
ly, I would declare that the
Court maintains closed trials for
one reason only: to safeguard
the interest of the defendant by
protecting him from needless
embarrassment and the possi-
bility of guilt by association in
the eyes of the student body
from the very fact that he has
been accused.

Finally, in this atmosphere
where the mere submission of
a letter to THE DAVIDSONIAN
on any subject will earn one the
churlish sccrn of most Davidson

peer groups, it is too much to
hope that a witness will be his
normal uninhibited self or even
agree to appear at all if he must
do so before the glowering glare
of the student body.

There is also criticism that
a defendant is generally not
given a fair chance: that he
does not have time to prepare
adequately for his defense,
that he is not told about his
opportunity of appeal, and
thet the general attitude of
the Court toward the defend-
ant is somewhat analogous to
the attitude of the spider to
the fly.

The first member of this cri-
tical triad has some merit; the
second and third members re-
flect more nearly a mindless at-
titude of factless prejudice.

While I do feel that the de-
fendant under our present trial
framework is given time enough
(at least five hours) to prepare
his defense, I. would suggest
that a change in Court proced-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Guilt Or Innocence:
. « « Chance Or Fact?

Patrick

Dear Editor,

Three weeks ago the Honor
Court met and dismissed a
student from college for an al-
leged violation of the Honor
Code. Unlike most of the. stud-
ents who have been accused by
the Court, this student refused
to confess his guilt.

When the verdict was render-
ed the accused stud-nt was
found guilty by the divided vote
of eight to three. This was the
first time in over three years
that a student was found guilty
and dismissed from schoo! by a
divided vote.

It is not my purpose to at-
tempt to prove the guilt or in-
nocence of the accused student.
The divided vote, however,
seems to indicate the evidence
in the case was not conclusive
proof of guilt. Yet, the decision
of the Court has been recorded
on the permanent record of the
individual involved, and it will

haunt him for the rest of his

life.

The point | would like to
make is that some basic
changes need to be made in
the trial procedure of the
Honor Court. The system, as
it now stands, is geared pri-
marily to bring about the con-
vietion of a guilty student, not
to acquit an innocent one.

In the past the Court’s cri-
terion for guilt has usually been
a confession by the accused. The
Court has usually been able to
obtain the desired confession;
but when it has noi, the Court
has been confronted with prob-

lems which it has not always:

judiciously faced.

Under the present system at
Davidson only a two-thirds vote
of the Court is required for
conviction. By all standards of
Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence this
requirement invites miscar.
Tiages .of justice. Our common
law has traditionally held that
a guilty verdict must be un-
animous. By requiring that all
jurors be certain beyond all
reasqnable doubt of guilt, the
chance of rendering injustice
has been cut to a minimum.

Another weakness of the

Honor Court is that students
are generally ignorant of the
procedures followed by the
Court. The Student Body Con-
stitution, ARTICLE V, Sec-
tion § states: “Trial proced-
ure shall be determined by
the Honor Court and made
available to the student body.
To the best of my knowledge
the Court has never made its
trial precedure available to
the Student Body...”

At presen: tie usual period
between the time an accused
student is notified that he must
appear and the time of his ap-
pearance before the Court is
about two hours. Whether |§in-
nocent or guilty, when confront-
ed with the accusation of an
honor violation, a student is
often emotionally disturbed.
Since little is known about
Court procedure, an innocent
Student in the best mental. state
probably could not collect his

thoughts in two hours.

In recording testimony at the
trial, the current procedure is
for the Court Recorder, who is
a member of the Court. to pre-
pare general minutes of the
testimony. When this procedure
is followed, the only record of
testimony which exists is the
information which the Recorder
feels is pertinent to the case.

Space prohibits the discussion
of several other apparent in.
justices in Honor Court proced-
ures. It should be evident, how-
ever, that some changes are
needed.

| would make these sugges-
tions. First, the Court should
comply with the Constitution
and make its procedure avail-
able to the Stydent Body. An
accused student should be al-
lowed time to “gather his
wits” and to adequately pre-
pare his. thoughts. The ac-
cused student should be told
the specific charges against
him. At least twenty-four

hours should be allowed for
this preparation.

It is possible that a guilty
student would leave campus
without waiting for trial if he
were given twenty-four hours to
appear. Provisions should be
made to try such a student in

absentia. Since a finding of
guilty or not guilty often de-
pends upon the actual words of
witnesses, verbatim testimony
should be recorded. A mechani-
cal recorder similar to that used
in many town council meetings
could be used. Finally, the Court
needs to establish a criterion,
more rigorous than a two-thirds
majority, for deciding guilt.

These are a few observations
on court policy. It should be
apparent that changes need to
be made. I would suggest that a
committee of Student Council
and Honor Court members be
appointed to meet with the
school’s legal counsel to study
and revise Honor Court proced-
ures.

Davidson College should
never be guilty of crucifying
an innocent student.

Dear Editor,

After I have heard of the
speech to Davidson students by
the president of the North Caro-
lina John Birch Society, I am
much distressed. It was just
such attitudes as this that in my
home country of Estonia gave
the Communists the great op-
portunity to weaken the people's
faith in our leaders and to use
such Rightist groups to create
a panic among the people that
led to the Communist overthrow.

The John Birch people in
our midst are doing more bad
than any supposed Commun.

ists they accuse. They should

follow the example of John

Birch himself, in fighting

Communism where it really

is, instead of pointing at their

own shadows.

I urge all present John Birch
Society members, as well as all
true anti-Communists, to sup-
port the- international Estonian
Freedom Fighters’ League (Va-
badus Pojaleste Liits), through
the League I am organizing in
Mecklenburg County.

Write me in care of general
delivery, Oornelius, North Caro-
lina, where I am employed.

Court

ure.to allow a more active de-
fense counsel with ample time
to prepare his case in conjunc:
tion with the defendant would
be appropriate.

The second criticism, that
the defendant is not informed
about his right of appeal, be-
trays 8 pure misstatement of
fact. The advisor to the de-
fendant is instructed to tell
him of his right of appeal, and
the Chairman, at the end o
the trial, specifically outlines
the appeal procedure.

As for the third criticism, it
reflects, I fear, a bigoted pre-
judice of destructive purpose. If
the members of the Court can
be criticized as to their general
attitude, it is because they have
been. too lenient, not too harsh.

Perhaps the existing system
in which the members of the
Court serve both as jury and
questioner could be improved
(let an active prosecutor comple-
ment an active defense counsel
with the remaining Court mem-
bers sitting as a jury and in-
terrogatitig the defendant only
through questions submitted to
the prosecutor’ in | reeess), but
the feeling of the members of
the Court toward men on trial

has always been that of men.

caught. between sympathy and
system, facing the painful re-
sponsibility, of a decision that
will be best. legally and moral-
jy for the man involved.
Finally some mal-informed
critics ‘have fulminated a-
gainst the unjust procedure

Procedure

of the Honer Court in con- .
vincing a man of en honor
offense by @ majority vote.
This criticism might have
some merit except for one
‘obvious factor: the Honor
Court requires a two-thirds
vote of eligible members to
convict a man of en honor of-
fense. This fact has been duly
reported in THE DAVIDSON-
1AN.

In deference to those with
sincere questions in their minds
about the justice of this proced-
ure, I would agree that there
are cogent arguments to sup-
port a unanimous vote as neces-
sary for an honor conviction.
Such a change, of course, would
require a greater degree of
maturity on behalf of Court
Members,

I will not discuss criticism of
the compulsory dismissal rule
at this time, because the Court's
request for some modification
of this rule is well known and
because a proposal to this effect.
is now before the Faculty for
consideration.

Contrary to the tone of some:
of my.remarks above, I-am not
condemning criticism per se,
for indeed silence is sometimes
the severest criticism. I only
ask that those who do criticize
base their barbs on a knowledge
of all the facts involved, and
not on the dubious authority of
Chambers’ hearsay or fraternity
scuttlebutt.

Big Government
Meets Big Steel

BY ROBERT MOORE

Last week Big Government landed the right com-
bination and Big Steel went down for the full count in
one of the most important domestic developments in re-
cent years. Big Steel swung its lofty haymaker, but the
end result was not the intended knockout.

Instead ‘a stunned and angry adversary bounced off

the ropes with the crowd on his side and landed a volley
of sharp, accurate jabs at its opponent's head. Big Steel
staggered and sank sadly to its knees.

RAISES QUESTIONS

Two questions were raised by this encounter. How
far can and should the President go in regulating big
business? Can the steel industry make its needed revo-
lutionary changes without raising and continuing to
raise its prices?

Despite the great importance of these questions,
there is another question which claims its own right of
significance. This is the question of why the steel indus-
try moved when it did. Among the suggested reasons are
these: it felt it needed the price raise and that it could
raise prices when it did; and the industry prefers to
generate its own capital for investment in modernization
and expansion rather than accept tax breaks from the
government.

However, none of these reasons properly answer.
the peculiar timing of the steel industries announcement.
The announcement of the price increase was made while
President Kennedy and Secretary of Labor Goldberg were
Still repoicing over the non-inflationary agreement which
Steel and labor had signed less than a week before. In
addition to this, the announcement came on ‘the day be-
fore a Presidential news conference.

TRAGIC FLAW

Both of these things hint strongly at what appe
to have been the tragic -flaw in the stecl industry's hove.
This was a lack of an intelligent political perspective.

The industry failed

timing and more

important, it underestimated its adversary. Chairman.
