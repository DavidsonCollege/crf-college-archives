Ruggers drop match
but show improvement

By VIC MCMILLAN
Staff Writer

A tremendous improvement
from an earlier loss to Greens-
boro has given the Davidson
Rugby Club an optimistic lift
for the remainder of the season,
despite a 24-12 loss to tough
N.C. State.

basketball courts, and indoor-
outdoor pool, squash courts,
and a dance studio.

“When it comes into being,
the ‘new facility would be
completely co-educational,”
Cartmill stated.

The area of women’s athletics
was brought up at the meeting.

“I think it’s time we should
be going in a more formal
direction in the area of women's
athletics at
Cartmill stated.

“Right now there’s a strong
possibility that a full-time
women’s staff could be added
next year,” Cartmill continued
before pointing out that al-
though the timing of such a
move would be appropriate it
would be dependent on the
budget allocated to the depart-
ment.

In the iniMmediate future,
Cartmill expressed the hope
that a field hockey team would
be formed this fall on a club
basis. If participation and
enthusiasm are significant,
Cartmill felt that the sport
might be moved to the intercol
legiate level next year.

In summarizing the results of
the meeting, Cartmill felt that
the most productive asset was
the foundation that was laid for
communication between the
components of the athletic
program at Davidson.

“It was a disseminating of

Davidson,”’

information,’’ Cartmil]l
commented. “All sides had
their say.”

The meeting was the first of
its kind since Cartmill took over
the post of Athletic Director
nearly two years ago and he felt
that in the future other meet-
ings of this nature would be a
welcome addition to the form-
ulation and review of athletic
policies at Davidson.

“A meeting like this held
once a year would be a real
iisset to the program at David-
son,” Cartmill concluded.

The no-substitution rule, im-
posed by the newly-formed
Carolina Rugby Football Union,
caused the loss of Paul Hens-
chen and Ronnie Benfield to the
Cats in the first half. This made
a significant. contribution to the
defeat.

Forced to play with two
fewer men for most of the
game, the Davidson club still
managed some bright mo-
ments.

Following a well-placed punt
by Bruce Wallis, Mike Stick
drove through «several Wolf-
pack defenders before lateral-
ling to freshman standout
Bucky Banks for the first
Davidson try.

Again the Wildcats scored as
Wilbur Swaim slashed through
the Wolfpack scrum.

Bob Schermer returned to
last year’s form, making both
field goal attempts following
the tries.
