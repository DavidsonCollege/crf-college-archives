On March 12, the Charlotte
Symphony Orchestra performed
three works by established com-
posers in Love Auditorium.
What’s so special about that?

_One of these works was com-

posed by Davidson’s own Wilmer: .

Welsh, chairman of the music de-
partment. The symphony, entitled
Davidson College, was first per-
formed March 10 in Charlotte’s
Ovens Auditorium. Davidson
College was commissioned by the
Charlotte Symphony and was
written in honor of Davidson’s
sesquicentennial.

The funding for the project
was provided by the North
Carolina Arts Council, which paid
Welsh a $5,000 stipend as he took
a sabbatical year off to write the
symphony.

Welsh’s work consists of four
movements: “Work,” “Play,”
“Faith” and “Witness.” “It will
not bedescriptive in that it tells the
story,” Welsh has said, “but it
may convey the mood of the
place.”

According to the Chronicle of
Higher Education, Welsh said
that “The unifying element in all
this is atwelve-tone row, which I

used as a source for all four move-
ments. Otherwise they would be
unrelated tone poems. The
twelve-tone row... needs to
provide the melodic and harmonic
source material that, in earlier
years, the key-of D major would
have given to someone writing in
that key. So it must be very care-
fully developed to provide enough
musical richness to sustain the
work.”

The symphony was conducted
by Leo Driehuys, himself. a
Davidson resident. Welsh said he
worked well with Driehuys and

the Symphony. The two weeks of —

rehearsal were “a happy experi-
ence.”

Welsh admitted sweating it
out before the performance. “This

is the first time it’s been done and

no one knows how the audience
will respond.”

Apparently, though, his fears
were unjustified. Critical re-
sponse to the work’s premiere was
very positive. Fleur Paysour,
music reviewer of the Charlotte
Observer, writes that Welsh’s
work is “honest; there’s not a trace
of artifice, pretension or gimmic-
kry. The composer knows where
he stands.”

Davidson College is Welsh’s

second major work, his first being
Symphony No. 1 in E Flat, which
the Charlotte Symphony _pre-

miered in 1973. He has also writ- .

ten a variety of smaller pieces, in-
cluding sonatas, preludes and pro-
cessions.

Panel focuses on Davidson dating scene

By SUSAN PEARSALL

“Is dating dead at Davidson?”
This question was the focus of a
panel discussion, moderated by
Housing Director Tom Jennings,
which took place Tuesday , March
10 in the 900 Room. Panel mem-
bers were Paul Kosmas, a senior,
Caryn Coppedge, a junior, Chew
Jones, sophomore, and Pete Hal-
verstadt and Lucia Kendall,
freshmen. Twice as many females
as males attended the panel dis-
cussion.

The factor which was most
‘ often discussed, as both a help to
platonic male-female relation-
ships and a hindrance to casual
dating, was Davidson’s student

body. While its small student
body fosters more and closer
platonic relationships between the
sexes, it also causes the feeling
that everyone on campus knows
whom one is seeing. Peer pressure
of this nature, according to Cop-
pedge, has caused a gap between
the heaviness of an exclusive re-
lationship and a strictly platonic
friendship. Casual dating is
frowned upon, said panelist Kos-
mas, because it carries the stigma
of “whoredom.” The closeness of

. Davidson life also causes prob-

lems when one considers the risk
involved in a breakup; one must
come into contact with a former
lover much too often for comfort,

over potential

panelists said. Risk is another hin-

' dering factor to dating; the person

who asks for the date may fear fu-
ture embarrassment if the date
goes badly.

Patterson Court date functions
add an additional aspect to the
unique problems of potential dat-
ers. Some members of the audi-
ence complained that those who
choose not to get a date for every
party are viewed negatively, and
that this constitutes pressure
against dating. Others stated that
the parties create an inordinate
amount of interest in the private
affairs of other students because
they spawn gossipy speculation
“relationships.”

Many agreed, however, that these
parties generally aid the dating
situation because they do encour-
age casual dates.

The female members of the
audience also briefly considered
reasons for dating problems here
such as 1) males are intimidated
by the intelligence ofthe females
here, causing males to seek dates
with “imported” girls from neigh-
boring colleges. 2) males think
that all the: freshmen girls are
“taken” by upperclassmen. 3)
many males consider Davidson
women to be too straightlaced.
However, no agreement on any of
these opinions could be reached.

So what is the state of dating at

Other pieces performed by the
Symphony Thursday night were.
Mendelssohn’s Symphony No. 4
in A Major and Barber’s Concerto
for Plano and Orchestra, Opus
38.’ The concert was broadcast
live by WDAV (89.9 FM).

Davidson? Freshman Mary Beale
says, “I do not think the ‘dating
situation’ is all that bad. A lot de-
pends on expectations and how
willing people are to take risks.”
Halverstadt cited such problems
as stereotyping and a lack of com-
munication. Coppedge believes
that “because Davidson students
are trained to know as much as
possible and to control many situ-
ations, we try to carry these traits
over into dating. We urge each
other to communicate, but. we
forget that it’s O.K. to communi-
cate indecision or  confu-
sion... all but being ‘just
friends’ or being involved in a ‘re-
lationship’ is not possible.”
