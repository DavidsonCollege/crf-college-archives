In rain, Davidson football falls to Emory and Henry 27-0
Wildcats struggle against Sports Illustrated's sixth-ranked Division III team

By Robert Lioyd-Still

Davidson knew this was go-
ing to be tough. Sports Illustrated
ranked Emory & Henry in their top
ten of Division III teams. On a

jrainy day with awful conditions,
the Wasps prevailed over the Cats
27-0.

Wasp Charlie Cole put the
game out of reach with a 92 yard
run, pushing his total for the day to
119 yards.

While Emory & Henry was
able to capitalize on their scoring

chances, the same could not be
said about Davidson. The Wild-
cats had the ball at Emory &
Henry’s 10 in the first half and at
the 5 and 4 in the second with
nothing to show. During the sec-
ond half the Cats even faked a field
goal. Del “Money” Turner was
open in the endzone but the pass
fell incomplete.

This was the seventeenth
straight regular season victory for
the Wasps. They made it to the
Division I-AA playoffsa year ago.

Davidson committed five turn- ©

overs in the first half to negate all
scoring opportunities. After the first
quarter, Emory & Henry led 13-0.
In the first half, the Wasps had the
ball seven times inside the Cats
thirty yard line. They only man-
aged three touchdowns out of those.
Freshmen Vershan Sherrill stopped
one of those drives with an inter-
ception at the goal line.

With a 20-0 deficit at half-
time, the Wildcats chances ap-
peared desolate. However

Davidson’s Jason Branch inter-
cepted an errant pass soon after the
break. With Kevin Holzworth at
quarterback and Richard Howell
playing the tail, Davidson marched
to the five yard line. But the Wild-
cats failed to score.

With only one_ yard,
Davidson’s rushing attack was dis-
mal. On a rainy day the Cats went
airborne collecting 178 yards. The
Wasps, on the other hand, worked
the ball on the ground totaling 230
rushing yards.

Senior Alden Smith and Jun-
ior Chris Leak did not play in
Saturday’s game. Leak hasa dislo-
cated finger, but he is expected
back next week. Smith will not
play again this season. Even with
these absences, the Cats defense
played strongly.

Davidson knew that these first
three games would be the hardest.
They hope to improve on their 1-2
record in the coming weeks. On
Saturday, they travel to Greens-
boro to face Guilford College.

High expectations pay off for women harriers at McAlpine Park

By Jean DeMoss

The women’s cross-country
team competed against seven other
teams at McAlpine Park on Satur-
day. United under the slogan “High
Expectations Pay Off,” the harri-
ers proved that it was a great day to
be a Wildcat.

During the warm-up stretch-
ing, pre-race strides, and culminat-
ing on the starting line, an electric
current sparked the women's team.
They were ready and eager to run
fast. With cool early morning tem-

peratures anda dry course, weather
conditions were close to perfect.
When the gun went off, nine
Davidson runners sprinted out of
box five. The first half mile of the
race was a straight, flat path over
grass, the course then Curved in to
the woods. ;
Sophomore sensation Phuong
Nyugen crossed the first mile
marker under six minutes and never
looked back. She was followed by
Davidson’s top five all under 6:20.
Nearly halfway through the race,

“the hill” loomed, challenging run-
ners to tackle the long, winding
uphill and the sudden downhill
drop.

After conquering the incline,
the Lady Wildcats emerged from
the woods and ran around a lake.
The two mile maker greeted the
runners as a reminder that there
was just one more mile left. The
third mile was as flat as the first
and the harriers buckled down for
fast third mile splits.

Phuong Nyugen crossed the

their-best performance yet. Bright
and early Sunday morning, the
Wildcats clobbered Louisville 4-
0. Wide-awake and ready to win,
Davidson took control of the game.
Within five minutes of play, the
Wildcats scored their first goal as
junior Nancy Hilles deflected
Nicole Ficeto’s initial shot into the
cage.

The Cats continued tough of-
fensive pressure throughout the
first half, but it wasn’t until the
second half that the Cats really
turned it on. Kledis scored the
second goal, receiving a pass from
Lang on a corner play. For the
third goal, Short and Hilles had an
effective two on one as Hilles
passed the ball at the top of the
circle and Short swept it into the

Freshman Rebecca MacLean
got her first assist of the season
when she crossed the ball to Laura
Kjeldgaard who, wrestling with the
Louisville goalie, tapped the ball
to Hilles for the fourth goal.

All in all the Wildcats played
an excellent game, demonstrating
