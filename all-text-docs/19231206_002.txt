Lenoir and Wofford

and V. P. I. on 1924

Other Eight Teams Will Likely
Keep Places on Davidson
Schedule

Dr. J. M. Douglas, graduate manager of
athletics, and Coach Monk Younger announce
the following tentative schedule for the 1924
Davidson football team:

September 20—Elon at Davidson.

September 27—Presbyterian College of S.
C. Undecided.

October 4—Wake Forest Undecided.

October 11—Wofford Undecided.

October 18—Lenoir at Davidson.

October 22—Furman at Columbia, S. C.

November 1—N. C. State Undecided.

November 8—Clemson at Davidson.

November 16—University of North Caro-
lina at Davidson.

November 27—( Thanksgiving)
Undecided.

Trinity

For the first time in many years no team
from the Old Dominion appears on the Da-
vidson schedule. Efforts were made and for
some time it was thought that Hampden-Sid-
ney would be played the coming year but
finally a conflicting date prevented this. Six

North Carolina and four South Carolina
teams complete the list.

With V. P. I. and Citadel gone and in
their places substituted Lenoir and Wofford
the 1924 schedule greatly resembles that of
the recently closed season. The team will get
off to an early start when on September 20th
they line up against Elon on Richardson
Field. The following Saturday P. C. will be
played, probably at, Rock Hill where the
game was played this fall. Wake Forest has
been offered a game on October 4th but have
never been heard from. On the following
Saturday Wofford will be played, a team
that was on the Davidson schedule for sev-
eral years hut was dropped in 1923. The
'place for this game is not yet known. Lenoir,
the opposition for the October 18 game, is a
newcomer on the Davidson schedule. Fol-
lowing this game only four days will be the
Furman scrap at the Columbia Fair. Ral-
cigh will probably be the scene of the N. C.
State game on November 1st. Clemson and
University of North Carolina will pay a
visit to Richardson field on November 8th
and 15th, respectively. The season will prob-
ably wind up with a Thanksgiving Day bat-
tle with Trinity,

The managers of the 1923 season did es-
pecially good work in placing six of the ten
games played so that the entire student body
could witness them, ‘The 1924 season will
see at least four games on Richardson Field
and the student will probably be able to see
two of the four games whose places is still
undetermined.

In preparation for this heavy  shedule,
Coach Younger is planning two months of
spring training—probably from February to
April. Coach Tex Tilson has been signed to
help with this work.| In this practice will
be developed the nucleus of next year's
squad. In regard to the coaches for the
coming season Dr. Douglas simply states
“The three coaches of the past season will
most probably remain at Davidson.”

Good Schedule Planned
For Yearling Quintet

Coach Rawson to Have Charge of
Fresh Cages

A new day has dawned for Freshmen in
basketball. This year they are going to have
a regular team. One that will make trips.

Coach Rawson will have charge of this
team. They will practice at night. The regu-
lar Varsity team will practice in the after-
noons. Coach Rawson will call for Volun-
teers for this team, from the entire Fresh
class, in‘a few days. All Freshmen interested
in basketball are urged to come out and try
for the team.

This team will have a regular schedule.
The trips it takes will not exceed six days,
because of a faculty ruling to that effect.
R. W. Ocland, is assistant Manager, he ‘s
now working on the schedule. He hopes to
have the schedule completed in the next few
days.

A Freshman team like this has long been
needed at Davidson.

The Fresh team will be the source from
which the Varsity will receive its players
in the fture.

DAVIDSON JAZZ ORCHESTRA
AIDS IN MINSTREL
PERFORMANCE

On Friday night, November 16th, the
Sharon school, about 10 miles from
Statesville, presented the “Bol-Wee-Vel
Minstrel.” Assisted by the Davidson Col-
lege Jazz Orchestra, it proved a great

success.
The auditorium was crowded until
there was no standing room left. The

high expectations of the large crowd

were by no means discouraged. The
success of the performance was due
largely to the efforts of Mr. Carl

Cathey, who, as principal of the school,
has developed it wonderfully during the
last two years. Mr. Cathey graduated
from Davidson in 1921.

The Davidson Orchestra was given a
supper at the school house after the
minstrel. There was so much left over
that each member of. the Orchestra was
given a box of chicken, sandwiches, cake,
candy, ete. to bring back with him.

The minstrel has had calls from sev-
eral other places, which will most likely
be filled in the near future.

After chapel the four classes were group-

it should be doubly valuable to some.
Pictures were also made of the rebuilt

knob to that door is on the inside. God |

“No one can resist the power of tempta- |

you try to fight your battles alone, your life

“He was tempted even as we are tempted!
This was no stage tempation, but real temp-
tation. He met the temptation with clenched
fists, and came off victorious.

“To receive the grace of God into his life,
