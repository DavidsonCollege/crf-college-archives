For the next couple of weeks
we’ re going to profile some sports
at Davidson you might not have
considered. Generally, they’re
going to be things youcan do alone

or with a group of other interested
people without the hassles of sched-
uled practices. They’ré going to be
the kind of things that you can do
on an afternoon or evening when
aerobics, weightlifting or running
seem like a chore instead ofa break.
Give them a shot.

Rockclimbing mightnotseem
like the sort of thing you could do
readily at Davidson, but it’s actu-
ally very accessible. The Physical
Plant has converted a racquetball
court to an assimilated rock face
for practice climbs in the basement
of Johnson Gym. There are cur-
rently three ropes set up on the two
adjacent walls, with varying de-
grees of difficulty. One involves
just a flat wall, one includes an
overhang, and the third deals with
the different situations that arise
when there’s a bit of an angle.

This is definitly not an aerobic
workout. Your heartrate might
shootup some, but yourlungsaren’t
going to be challenged. It does;
however, cover all of your muscle
groups. In fact, you’re likely to
come across muscles you had for-
gotten that you possessed.

One of the best parts about this
sport is that it sounds so impres-
sive and dangerous, but in reality
involves very little risk. You’re
much less likely to suffer an injury
climbing than if you were to joina
pickup game of basketball or rac-
quetball- - unless Dair is working
the ropes and then your chances of
injury rise slightly.

Davidson outdoors has all of
the necessary equipment already,
so all you really need to worry
about is clothes that allow flexibil-
ity and some tennis shoes. You’re

going to want to leave your
crosstrainers behind, though. It’s
going to be tough to find those toe
holds with two and a half inches of
sole to bother with; so try to stick
with thin-soled shoes. If you find
yourself climbing all the time and
want to invest in climbing shoes,
they’ll run you somewhere in the
neighborhood of one hundred dol-
lars.

The wall is open from 3-5 and
7-9 Mondays through Thursdays.
Generally you can find Steve Tre-
gay there in the evenings and he’s
a great source for more informa-
tion on shoes and a good deal more
on this topic. He’s the guy down
there maneuvering the practice
holes around to create impossible
climbs. Ask him about his butt-
Starts.

His number is -6540.
