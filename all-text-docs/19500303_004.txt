would question the ability of the five named on the first team,
we question that it is what an All-State team should be. For
that reason, and to get his views, we wrote Furman Bisher a
letter about the matter. It says very little that most don’t al-
ready know, but we’re certain that it expresres the opinions of

THE DAVIDSONIAN

SPRING SPORTS GET UNDER WAY

not a few. Here it is for what it’s worth...
Dear Mr. Bisher :

We here at Davidson were very interested in your recent
edition of the News which carried the All-State basket ball team
for this year. Needless to say, our interest mainly stemmed
from the fact that our own Whit Cobb failed to make the squad.

I’m not writing you to argue on this point for I full well,
realize that the selections were not made by you or your staff

but by coaches of the Big-Five teams who should know what
they are talking’ about. Even if you had made the selections
yourself, I, wouldn’t feel myself qualified to contradict the
opinion of a much more qualified sports writer than I'll ever be.

No, what I would likeeto bring forward is the soundness |-

of your method of selecting tlie honored quintet. Of course no
better committee conld be found to do this than the coaches,

but the point 1 don’t understand is why you have a team made,

up of five players who received the highest number of votes,
regardless of the position the men play. This to me is not what
a true All-State team should be. What is the difference in hav-
ing an all-star basketball squad with two centers and three
‘forwards and an all-star football squad with four quarterbacks
such as Galiffa, Williams, Tidwell and LeBaron?

It just doesn’t seem quite fair to have a mythical team
unless each position is represented. The guards, which the News
omitted, are an integral part of the make-up of any team. Why
shonldn’t they get the snme recognition for their proficiency as
the high scoring forwards or bean-pole centers? Often guards
are less glamorons in their performance (not so with our boy
Cobb) but their value as team men cannot be overestimated.

To push my argument a little farther, I believe you'll agree
that if it were possible to play a game between the News team
of Horvath, Ranzino, Dickey, Nearman, Kappler .. . and Cobb,
Groat, Nearman, Ranzino and Dickey who were selected by
another newspaper, the latter quint. would win hands down,
because of the addition of two guards of the caliber of Groat
and Cobb. This is of course problematical, but I hope you sec
the point I’m making.

I really have no great interest in the matter of how you
select your teams in the future for it's certainly vour own busi-
ness. I simply wanted to present the other side of the picture to
you in the hope that you will seriously consider the matter and
possibly avoid what might he called future injustices to deserv-
ing players. a

I hope that you will find time to write me your ideas on
this matter, regardless of what your opinions may be, because
1 am so corivinced that my stand on the question is right. that
I would sincerely like to hear your side of the story. Doubtless
you have perfectly valid reasons for selecting the team as it was,

Pitchers, . Catchers

Throwing a Few As
Season Draws Near

By BILL BROOKS

Davidson's baseball team, if the
pitchers and catchers are any indica-
tion, should be hard to beat this
season. Last year’s mound aces,
Fred Hengeveld and Charleton Tor-
rence, are back again with added
support from Norman Whitehart,
Lefty Hunter, Harold Smith, and
Tom Craven.

The big question mark is Tor-
rence’s arm. Last fall he suffered
a complete shoulder separation in
fraternity football, and speculation
has been great as to whether he
could pitch this spring. Coach
Jamerson says that from all indi-
cations, Charleton apparently is
sound now and can be expected to
star again for the Cats if no hidden
trouble develops. :

Hengeveld has just finished bas-
ketball, where he starred, and
should be ready Freddy as usual
Whithart, who injured his arm
three years ago, reports that it is
now as strong as it has ever been.
With him in good shape, the pitch.
ing staff will be much stronger.
Lefty Hunter, the portside pitcher,
knows the business thoroughly, and
is gaining control rapidly. He'll be
counted on for heavy duty and
| should come through. From. the
freshman team of last year, Harold
‘Smith is showing the most promise.
Coach Charley is well pleased with
his work thus far, and will rely on
“Smitty” for good support. Tom
Craven is going through the paces
and can really burn it in.

Two sophs, Johnny Jervis and
C. L, Runyan, are jockeying for the
catching position. Jervis is current-
ly swimming, and C. L. dislocated
his shoulder, but both should be
ready in time and will carry the
load together.

ing machine, Pa?”

“No, son, God made the first one;
Edison made the first one that could

that was played in Charlotte lasi
December. After each boy is con-
tacted by Davidson, he comes here
and spends a few days vonferring
with the coaches and getting a
general idea of the school. The sec-
ond floor of the old gymnasium
has been made into a dormitory
for the visitors, who eat in the col.
lege cafeteria, with the exception
of a few who are invited to various
fraternity boarding houses for their
meals.

After the interviews with the
coaches, the boys fill out general
information forms, giving the ath-
letic department data on the
achievements, skills, and qualifica-
tions of each boy. Each athlete's
scholastic record is then checked
by the Registrar’s office to see if he

Spring Drills

ter Final Stages

Davidson students, alumni, and visiting sportswriters—
three castes of mankind who suffered through the Wildcat win
famine of ’49—will see the brighter spring of a new year and
with it a preview of next fall’s football fashions at Davidson
when Coach Crowell Little exhibits the fruits of his off-season

Strong Tennis Team
Rounding Into Form

By DAN McKEITHEN
When the last basketball game

has been played, athletic attention.

shifts to the spring sports. With
spring comes Davidson's winning-
est team—the tennis team. Al-
though the weather hasn’t assured
us: that tennis season is here, Coach
Derrick Barton has had his boys
practicing for the past three weeks,
cold of hot, windy or not.

From the looks of the material

working out, it seems that the ten-

nis team can make up for the wins
that the football and basketball
teams failed to get. Ace Bo Roddey
will return to his familiar number
one spot while Teddy Keesler will
keep his number two, unless Whit
Cobb jumps up to take it. Although
¥s too early to make any predic.
tions on the other three slots, it
is a cinch they will be in very
capable hands. Ready to make
battle royal out of it are former
subs Bill Child, Rob Palmer,
Peyre Kennedy, John Crosland and
Allan Fanjoy,°as well as ex-frosh
stars Allan Strand and Dewey Kees-
ler.

However, these men are not go-
ing to have a winning season with-
out really putting out. The heaviest
schedule in the history of the team
has beer arranged. Looking at the
schedule, one not only finds such
top teams as Rollins, University of
Florida, Florida State, William
and Mary, Harvard, Yale, Kalama-
zoo, UNC, Duke and Cincinnati,
but also an international team of
Mexico’s best players.

The big goal the team will be
aiming for is the Southern Confer-
ence Tennis Tournament, which
will be held here at Davidson on
May 11, 12 and 13. Now that
Kovaleski of W. & M., and Seixas
of Carolina, have graduated, our
own Ro Roddey will probably grab
the top berth in singles seedings.

Afterwards, when all data has

visitors. The growth of a sound and

labors in the Red and White game -
in Richardson Field Stadium next
Saturday afternoon.

Following the plan now in use
at North Carolina and N. C. State,
the athletic department will charge
an admission to the game which
will see the material split equally
on talent and Little seated in the
stands while assistant coaches run
the show.

As far as work has. progressed
so far, indications are of a slightly
optimistic nature, and there are a
couple of ‘rising sophs who have
helped bring the sunlight into the

| gloom. To say that A. C. Gregg and

Roy White are moving up to fill
the posts vacated by Jake Wade
and Charlie Rimer would tech-
nically be the truth, but it would
also be a takeoff on the ability of
both boys. '

A. C. has speed to burn, but
what is even more remarkable about
the comparatively light scatback is

STUART .. . Looks good

his hard-hitting drive. As a defen-
sive halfback last’ fall for the Da.
vidson frosh, Gregg racked with
regularity bigger backs who slipped
through into his territory. He came
up fast and made contact quick.
But that drive he put to better use
as a ball carrier.

With power plus speed, Gregg
showed last fall that he can not
only scat, back shake himself loose
when temporarily in the arms of a
would-be tackler. A quick spurt and
he was out and on his way. He's
been demonstrating the same elu-
siveness to date in winter drills.
Stomaching Lambeth’s pitch from
the T-spot, Gregg pops through
holes that are open-and.close af-
fairs and then goes like wind.

White, who may well pick up the
nickname Whizzer which another
White, a gridder out West, made
famous a few years back, operates
with A. C. like a twin from the
other half. The North Carolinian
who did his preping in Illinois looks
even more like the track man he is
in a football suit than most track-
