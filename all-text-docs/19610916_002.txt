THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

Fresh Breeze From The Hill

Dean Richard C. Burts was late
to his first DAVIDSONIAN interview.
“How long do you wait for a profes-
sor? A doctor? A college administra-
tor?” said the new dean as he showed
three of the staff into his office.

The dean had let a student use his
telephone during lunch hour. ‘I wait-
ed as long as I could but he still hadn't
finished!” he said.

“I have nothing to say about shirt-
tails!” cracked Dean Burts when we
tried to draw him out on the rumor
that he would attempt to make the
Davidson student body tuck in its col-
lective shirt.

Dean Burt’s attitude is typical,
‘we hope, of a new look on the Hill. We
were extremely pleased by the
friendliness and amicabiiity of this
man, new to us and tu Davidson Col-
lege. We talked seriously about some

of the issues on campus: fraternities,
drinking, the new traffic court (see
story on page one). And we detected,
or hope we detected, a strength and
fairness, together with a real respect
for student opinion, in this man from
Mercer.

We dre looking forward to more
discussions in the future. Ten days
into the new semester is hardly the
time to expect miracles or drastic
changes in policy. But we are grateful
for all the signs shown so far. As the
new dean learns more about David-
son, and as we get to know him better,
we are counting on a fresh breeze to
blow from the Dean of Students of-
fice. If it can revive the tired opinions
of even a few members of the so-call-
ed College Family we will have been
benefitted.

New People, New Spirit, Old Songs

At their opening meeting almost
two weeks ago, the Class of 1965 sang
the alma mater. That put them ahead
of most Davidson students who only
sing it (or mumble through it) once
during their college careers — at
graduation.

We were pleasantly surprised and
embarrassed when Dean Burts, a new-
comer so to speak, made the sugges-
tion and Joe Martin led in the singing
—pleased, because an alma mater is
meant to be sung, and embarrassed,
because we seniors were caught not
knowing the words any better than the
freshmen.

This episode was the start of a de-
termined efort on the part of our new
dean and our new cheerleader to re-
vive a meaningful school spirit. There
could be no better start than to restore
the spirited singing of our fight song
and alma mater at athletic events, pep
rallies and other student convocations.
We support them wholeheartedly in
this effort.

Yesterday, Joe and the cheerlead-
ers and the freshmen showed us a
thing or two about this new drive. He
has Groved he has backing of the Class
of ’65.

Coach Dole has some mighty high
hopes for this season and rightly so
with the fine team he has assembled.
Coach Driesell is talking of big-league
basketball and just look at his fresh-

men.

But victories aren’t essential to
a revival of the spirit that Dean Burts
or Joe or the freshmen are anxious
for. Nor do we need riots to prove-its
existence. It’s a pride that reaches be-
yond Richardson Field into the dorm,
or classroom or wherever Davidson
men assemble.

_ it’s an_ awareness of the fine
things Davidson has been in the past
and can be in the future.

Let's sing along with the fresh-
men. They are planning to teach us
the words, and a few things about
Davidson in the process.

Innocuous, Inane, Ineffective

Again this year the Entering
Freshmen have been subjected to the
Faculty Reception. We might suppose
the custom is almost as old as the col-
lege’s 125 years.

The tense attempts at conversa-
tion and almost strained smiles are
certainly much older. And although
we cannot believe there has ever been
another Dr. Chalmers Davidson, per-
haps there was some professor just
as personable, if not so genealogical,
to animate the line 125 years ago.

Undoubtedly, the rite held little
profit or pleasure for anyone. It is not
pleasant, but it is no ordeal. It has
simply become innocuous.

Hallelujah.

After long years of DAVIDSON.

campaign and general griping,
the Student Body owes its thanks to
President Martin and the Administra-
tion for the ten per-cent reduction in -
the list price of texts in the College
Book Store this fall. The move is part |
of a new policy to make profits, which
had formerly been placed in a student
loan fund, directly available to the
students.

By retaining half of the 20 per-
cent discount which the college gener-
ally receives from the publishers, the
bookstore should be able’ to cover
operational losses and costs, including
Mr. Kimbrough’'s salary.

Most students are not aware that
the college makes no charge for over-
head and bookkeeping costs. But most
of us are aware of the rising publish-

When the students numbered 65
and the faculty, three, and in the days
of formal introduction, the faculty re-
ceiving line had more meaning. But
we are much larger and much less for-
mal in our 125th year.

We can all be proud of a tradition
of friendly, personal faculty-student
relationships. A custom which does
not. conform to this tradition and to
our times decays, is destructive to the
good in the tradition.

The Faculty Reception is such a
custom. Let's replace it with some-
thing more timely and positive.

It is time for an honorable retire-
ment.

er’s prices of textbooks over which
neither the college nor we have any
control. The annual rise amounted to
between five and ten per-cent this
year and will continue indefinitely.

The bookstore could well help
Students meet inflationary prices by
expanding its operations to include a
used book exchange. The value of
such a service has long been realized
by other colleges where college-oper-
ated exchanges have existed for years.

Since the YMCA discontinued its
exchange service several years ago,
the Union has been the lone operator
in this field. A centralized, efficient
book exchange would be the logical
implementation to what we think is
a very proper and just change in book-
Store policy.

DEAR FRESHMEN

The Making

Of A

Man?

By JOHN A. CARSON

Davidsonian

aging Editor

You have just been through the most unusual week
of your life. Probably each of you began the week feeling
pretty important. You were astounded at the friendliness
of the upperclassmen, and at their sincere interest in

you.

Tuesday afternoon your room
was flooded with fellows from
your favorite fraternity — they
seem to really like you. They
kept coming — each with a
warm smile and firm hand-
shake.

Wasn't it something at the
house Tuesday night! More
smiles, handshakes, big  wel-
come, “Glad to have you down
.. .» Hope you'll come back.” It
seemed almost like a dream.

You had expected to come to
Davidson as a lowly freshman,
to have to get around on your
own, to feel insignificant and
lost in a world of college sophis-
ticates. But all of a sudden.
there you were: sophomores,
juniors, seniors — all swarming
your room, rolling out the red
catpet for you.

But then you noticed it was
Wednesday afternoon, and
though there had been some
fellows from other fraterni-
ties by to see you. THEY were
not around.

You met one of THEM in the
hall — the same one who walk-
ed you back to the dorm last
night. He grunted a half-way
friendly “hello” as he brushed
past you. Then you realized it.

You were no longer one of
THEIR boys. But why? You
tried to be friendly. You wore
your finest clothes. You tried
to speak to everyone at least
once. You did your best, but
suddenly they're gone.

And so it went. Some of you
felt big all week; others felt
smaller each day as you watched
them flock around the guy next
door.

And yet no matter how big
you felt at times, surely you
began to grow weary during
the latter part of the week.
You got sick of smiling at the
hounds es they visited your
room more and more.

You got tired of shaking
hands with a hundred different
fellows each night. .

You began to fee) that they
were getting as tired of visiting
you as you were of seeing them.

Not to mention your studies.
Thank goodness you could re.
treat to the library for awhile
each afternoon.

But it’s all over now S*m-
of you are in the fraternity of
your choice, others chose »
lesser one, still others remain
independent.

At any rate, you are now
once again a person The u-
perclassmen have abandon-d
your dorms. No more bie
smiles, handshakes, smal!
talk. ts all over.

Now you're just another stu-
dent — one among a thousand.
You are going to need a ot
more than that big smile and
firm handshake in order to get
by.

Rush Week is over. Classes
are well under way. Freshman
regulations go into effect to-
morrow. You'll soon be gzet-
ting to know what Davidson's
really like.

Best of luck.

Honor Court Chairman
Presents PlanFor Year

By HARRISON WELLFORD
Chairman of the Honor Court

Ldst spring, in the wake of
a serious increase in thefts and
other more nebulous infringe-
ments on the code of honor at
Davidson, THE DAVIDSONIAN
called for a comprehensive pro-
gram of definition, education,
and enforcement of the Honor
System as a means to recharge
the. Davidson atmosphere with
the spirit of honor that for so
long has been one of the most
cherished traditions here.

It was felt that one of the
main reasons students were not
enforcing the Honor System was
because they did not fully un-
derstand what the Honor System
really is.

"As an outgrowth of these con-
cerns, the Honor Court, through
the cooperation of THE DAVID-

-‘SONIAN, will initiate this fall a

series of articles which will at-
tempt to clarify, re-interpret,
and re-evaluate the system of
honor at Davidson and the in-
dividual student's relation to it.

tn this premier article of the
series, the Honor Court would
like to outline briefly some of
the areas where it feels clarifi-
cation is necessary and to
mention how it hopes to im-
plement a vigorous program
of definition, education, and
enforcement.

Briefly, the areas where the
Court feels clarification and in-
terpretation are needed lie in
the distinction between duty-
bound and honor-bound, and
the responsibility that the for-
mer carries for the individual
student; in the whole spectrum
of pledged work, from reviews
and makeups to book reports
and the misuse of spot boxes; in
the clear delineation of Honor
Court jurisdiction, with the pos-
sible extension of student body
regulation jurisdiction to in-
clude dormitory behavior and
the defacing of library posses-
sions; in the practice of diving,
that is, feigning illness so that
one will not have to take a test
at the prescribed period; and in
th drinking rule — exactly what
it encompasses as interpreted
by the Court.

The Honor Court will strive
to carry through its program
by a series of measures. It will
work with the faculty to tight-
en areas where laxness, as in
the readministration of ol
tests, might: induce or encour-
age dishonesty; and the Court
will cooperate closely with the
Student Council and Mr. Cur-
rie’s office to plan coordinated
policy in regard ‘to upholding
the Honor System.

By emphasizing its concern
with basic dishonesty and in
working to introduce an

amendment to give expression
to this concern, the Court will
strive to counteract eny
false impression that honor
at Davidson is limited to the
confines of the technical ar-
ticles listed in the Constitu-
tion.

Finally by introducing a tho-
rough system of education
through chapel programs and

-DAVIDSONIAN articles, the

Honor Court will work to keep
the student body informed of
Court interpretation and policy
regarding issues arising under
the Honor System and Student
Body Regulations.

This is your Honor Court's
program and the means it will
use to forward its success. Yet
whatever the efforts of the
Court, and the other branches
of student government, this
program to reinstall a vibrant
spirit of honor at Davidson will
fail without the concerned co-
operation and interest of each
individual member of this stu-
dent body.

Honor cannot be imposed
from above, for it rests within
each man’s conscience. This
Court can only try to create an
atmosphere conducive to honor;
in the end, the responsibility for
making a decision to uphold
hnor lies with each of you.

Saturday and Sunday was all
smiles. At that time the “What's
your major” ‘s and “What did
you think of Orientation” ’s
were still friendly. By Wednes-
day the grins became a little
gritty.

The early hour sessions aft-
er the parties began to show in
the faces and conversations of
the fraternity men; freshmen
began to hide out in the library
and the gym.

Books and studies struggled
futilely for the upper hand in
the hand-grabbing competition,
with another night of parties
looming large. At the parties,
brothers and Rushees alike had
to present their best, and each
man’s best had to be “natural.”

HARD

It was hard on the freshmen;
harder, much harder on the up-
perclassmen. From two to six
or eight hours a night of wrang-
ling, boredom, anxiety — the
complete spectrum of emotions
drained a share of spirit from
every boy at every house.

Thursday and Friday the talk
was, in most cases, no longer
cheap. The wire wasn’t far off.
You got with “your boy” and
you explored each other. The
Rushees showed what they
wanted, and the fraternities
showed them hard that they had
it. The singing was a little soft-
er, a little closer, a little more
reverent. The handshakes were
fewer and longer; a squeeze on
the shoulder replaced the pat
on the back.

BIDS ISSUED

Friday night brought the fin-
al session, and nobody minded
the heat. When the parties were
over and the hands were wrung,
cheeks had dried, and the last
stirring phrase had died away,
the grim business of the bid
was met head-on.

The night brought chuckles
and groans, relief and hurt,
clash after clash among the
closest of friends. Feelings
were trod on and a new side of
the sophomores was seen.

But the central theme was
sustained: The best interests of
the essence of “fraternity.”

Saturday afternoon was the
culmination of a onehundred-
and-sixty-eight hour week. For
many it was jubilant; for some
it wasn't. For all it was a relief.

But it’s over now — for bet-
ter or for worse.
