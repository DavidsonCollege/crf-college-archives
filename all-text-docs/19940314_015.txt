Thinclads still breaking records

By Jean DeMoss

The Davidson women thinclads opened
the outdoor track season Saturday at the
Seahawk Invitational at UNC-Wilmington.
Competing first for the Wildcats was Lara
Burkholder in the long jump. Despite the
less than perfect conditions, Burkholder fin-
ished first and set a new school record.

In other events, Maria Whitehead fin-
ished sixth place in the triple jump with a
mark of 34’13/4".

Setting the standards for the distance
runners, sophomore Marie Grisez paced
herself to a 4:59 1500m. Phuong Nguyen
won the next heat in a stunning 4:57, a
personal best.

Davidson’s pack of 800m runners con-

sisted of Sallie Permar, Karen Marshall, and
Annie Parsons. Permar ran a personal best
of 2:30. Marshall, in her first race since knee
surgery, ran an impressive 2:35, while Par-
sons ran a.2:43.

For the field events, sophomore Erika

Gromelski threw the discus 87’5" which

earned her a fourth place finish. The last
event of the day was the 4X400m relay.

The team of Lara Burkholder (63), Sallie
Permar (67), Marie Grisez (65), and Phuong
Nguyen (66) chased the school record.

The Wildcats are far ahead of their 93
performances. With the addition of a tal-
ented freshmen class, the thinclads are in
quick pursuit of breaking many school
records.

Sailing team takes Ist at home regatta [ [ca

By Andrew Cole

The Davidson sailing team
won the second regatta of the spring
on Lake Norman last Saturday,
moving it into first place ahead of
College of Charleston in the North
Points division of the South Atlan-
tic Intercollegiate Sailing Asso-
ciation.

The morning started out with
a light but sailable breeze and
Davidson came out quick in the
first five races, posting four firsts
and a second. The wind did not

hold, however, and the last three
races were sailed in a virtual
vacuum with less than perfect fin-
ishes for the team.
Fortunately, the earlier scores
were good enough to keep
Davidson in first place throughout
the entire regatta. Six other teams
came to compete, including Col-
lege of Charleston, The Citadel,
Clemson, University of South
Carolina, NC State, and the Savan-
nah College of Art and Design.
The team is now preparing for the

final North Points regatta of the
spring. Ifit can stay in the top four
teams in the North, it will go to
University of Florida on April 10
to compete in the District Champi-
onship, from which the top two go
to the Intercollegiate National
Championship in May.

Sailing for Davidson this
weekend were junior Dave Saudek,
sophomores Frances Bailey, Mor-
gan Perry, and Andrew Cole, and
freshmen Ian Fitzpatrick and
Heather Radden.
