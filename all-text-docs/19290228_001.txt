Pillars of Old Chambers to be

and Changes for R. O. T. C.

Department Planned

During its regular mid-winter meeting
held here last week, the board of trus-
tees of the college made a number of de-
cisions and rulings which will have far-
reaching effects on the future of the col-
lege.

The major question under considera-
tion at this time was the request for re-
tirement made by Dr. W. J. Martin iast
year at commencement. Dr. Martin's
resignation from the presidentship of the
college was accepted, but the trustees
were not willing to sever completcly the
relation of Dr. Martin with the college,
and accordingly they elected him to a pro-
fessorship, at the same time granting
him a year’s leave of absence.

He will assume his duties as a professor
in September 1930.

The following recommendations made
by Dr. Martin to the board were adopted :
(1) that adequate endowments for the
library be secured in order that it may
be well maintained and its stock of books
improved; (2) that the number of stud-
ent scholarships be increased, and (3)
that immediate steps be taken to secure
funds for the building of a new infirm-
ary, which will be complete and modern
and better suited to the the
college than the present one.

Among a number of other matters de-
cided upon by the trustees were several
which will be of especial interest to the
students. It was definitely determined
that the four pillars of Old Chambers
Building which now stand in front of
the new building shall be iorn down.
Moreover the colleg¢7Y. M. C. A. was
offered the use of Shearer Hall for its
headquarters as soon as that building shall
he vacated.

The R. O. T. C. Department is to be
moved from its present locatign in the
Armory, which is the 6ld Marton Build-
ing, to the Temporary Laboratory Build-
ing, which is at present occupied by the
Physics and Biology departntents of the
college; these latter departments will be
removed to New Chambers on its com-
pletion. The present Armory is to be
torn away for the beautification of the
campus, and the R. O. T. C. Department

days lost just before the Christ-
mas vacation on account of the
influenza epidemic.

LECTURE GIVEN BY
DAVIDSON ALUMNUS

Dr. Anderson Tells of Airplane
Trip Over Western Europe

On Wednesday night February 20, in
Shearer Hall, Dr. Neil’Anderson, David-
son alumnus and trustee spoke on a trip
over western Europe by airplane. Be-
sides being a Presbyterian pastor in Sa-
yannah, Ga., Dr. Martin stated in intro-
ducing the speaker, Dr. Anderson is also
well known as a theologian, author and

inventor.
In the introduction to his speech, Dr.
Anderson said that there were many

people who, when they heard of his pro-
posed trip last year wanted to know why
he Wanted to fly over Europe instead of
seeing it in the conventional method with
guides and on foot. To this question he
answered that (1) he wanted to go any
way but the conventional one with the
chattering guides and companions and
(2) he had always had a desire to fly
anyway being of a restless nature all his
life.

Dr. Anderson then stated that he had
gotten his first chance to fly not many
years ago in Savannah, and was rather
surprised at the sense of safety and lack
of dizziness he felt. Thus one difficulty
that arose in planning the trip was elim-
inated, ‘that of the safety of it. The
other chief obstacle was the cost but
through the courtesy of the flying com-
panies he and his companion were granted
a reduction and so this hindrance was
removed. With reference to the comfort
of such a trip, Dr. Anderson stated that
the airports and transportation to and
from them were comfortable as any of
the railroad stations of today.

The itinerary of the journey included
the following chief points: London, Paris,

Geneva, Genoa, Venice, Munich, Berlin
and back to Paris.
Next some slides of the aeroplanes

used, views from these and other objects

Vocational Guidance

MEDICINE

(This article was contributed to The
Davidsonian by Dr. Charles Mayo of the
Mayo Clinic at Rochester, Minn., pon
the request of the Vocational Guidance
Committee. )

The study of medicine is arduous, but
it is wonderful in accomplishment and
its varied interests. If you can but for-
get its rewards, in the worry over wheth-
er you are doing what is expected of
you and what is best, and strive to do it,
rewards will come until you wonder
whether you really deserve them, and,
being but human, are stimulated to make
greater effort. Come with ns into medi-
cine, the study of which will give you
possession of more knowledge cf the
world than any other study, as you
will learn nature in botany and zoology,
and of birds and animals, also the science
of the earth’s structure in geology, and
of waters with their fish, and other life,
and above all, chemistry, and physics,
knowledge of structure that you can take
down and rebuild combinations of ele-
ments. Medicine was always the learned
profession. When medicine was develop-
ed by the Greeks to a high standard it
then and since was the source of scienti-
fic progress. What was known of Bo-
tany, Chemistry, Astronomy and- Phy-
sics accumulating through all the ages
was a great part of the training of the
physicians of each period.

In the sixteenth century life averaged
but twenty years, in 1850 it was but forty
years, but with the appreciation of the
causes of disease it has now advanced
to fifty-eight years by public health con-
trol, i. e., preventive medicine. It was
the death of babies and children, that
held averages low. We hear of big game
hunters, but their work and danger were

as nothing to that of the microbe hunters

who studied disease and its causes, often
falling a victim to the disease themselves,
but others carried on. Engineers credit
the building of the Panama Canal to mod-
ern engineering’ methods. The French
had good engineers and wonderful ma-
chinery. We take out of the Minnesota
iron mines each year more pay dirt than
the entire diggings of the canal involved.
Our medical men under General Gorgas
made the work at the cahal possible by
stopping the stalk of death from yellow
fever and malaria; it is now one of the
most healthy places in the world as the
government medical men still have charge
of this area. Medical investigators have
found the causes of the many diseases
which decimated the people of former
times and, by prevention, made commu-
nity health possible. We are now dying
of our individual poor health from neg-
lect or disease and inheritance conditions,
which are often acquired from ignorance
concerning their cause and prevention.
Health is not necessary to happiness, con-
genial work with pleasant’ associations is
happiness; in fact, happiness is a state
of mind, it may often be found in the in-
sane as visions of grandeur. Happiness
may be cultivated by the sane to advan-
tage and then may be found in doing
good to others; to an extraordinary ex-
tent it is cultivated by the unfortunate
blind.

The medicine man of today stands in
a curious position. Responsible for mak-
ing life longer, he becomes morally res-
ponsible for making old age worth living,
and must help avoid senility or the result
is but an added burden upon community
life in general as the sick and injured
hamper more than the dead.

Come with us as medicine is just ‘in
its infancy, and here is a place for all
who will work in it to plan for the man
of the near future.

Sigma Delta Psi, widely known as
the “Phi Beta Kappa Athletics”

the stimulation of athletics. One fea-

cases able to fulfill all the requirements
of the fraternity. On the other hand,
