Biologists seek finances
for Stanley County land

By JEFF SICH
Business Manager

The opportunity to pur-
chase land in Stanley County,
North Carolina, which is bot-
anically significant (David-
sonian March 26, 1976) has
sparked the Davidson College
Biology Department and Bio-
logy Society into a large
fund-raising effort.

The department is in the
process of trying to contact
former students who had
shown an interest in botany.

“The college is allowing us
to contact those graduates
who have not contributed in
the past five years and who
had been enrolled in a botany

Scholarship Bridge ends

The ninth session of the
Davidson Scholarship Bridge
Tournament ended Sunday
night with the leaders from the
previous week—George Fla-
vell, Allan Rockett, and Mike
Russ—holding their places to
win the first three prizes in the

_ contest.

Mr. Bill Woodson, board

member from the American

Contract Bridge League’s sev-
enth district, presented the
scholarships of $200, ‘$100,
and $50 for the first three
places to the winners.

Selection of the winners was
based on the score averages of
the best six sessions, of which
only four could be played with
the same partner.

The ACBL initiated the
scholarship program last sum-

mer and has established
$17,500 in awards to be given

in college and university tour-
naments across thé nation.

Davidson has the distinc-
tion of being the first college
to begin a scholarship tour-
nament, and has the option of
holding a tournament again
next year.

Approximately thirty peo-
ple participated in this year’s
competiton, with an average
of five tables being played at

each of the nine sessions.

course here at Davidson,” said
Professor of Biology Tom
Daggy.

A method of financing the
purchase has been arranged
through the Nature Conser-
vancy, a national organization
whose purpose is to conserve
natural areas.

““The organization has a
large multimillion-dollar revol-
ving sum which they can
spend quickly but the amount
must be repaid. They are
willing to buy the entire
property for $15,000 if we can
raise $7,000. The remaining
$8,000 must be repaid within
one year,’’ said Daggy.

“The Nature Conservancy
has set a May 29 deadline for
us to raise the $7,000 and we
are also trying to meet a May
30 deadline imposed by the
owner of the property.” '

Stanley County Public
Health Officer George Leiby
had started our fund raising
with a contribution of $1,000.

“Since that time, Mason
and Nancy Wallace have don-
ated $500. Wallace is a David-
son graduate and a member of
the Board of Trustees. We also
have in hand a donation of
$125 from the North Carolina
Botanical Gardens,” contin-
ued Daggy.

Recently, Craven Williams,

Vice President for Develop-
ment emphasized that, ‘‘there
has not been the thought that
Davidson will be sole owner of
the property. We're interested
in the educational value of the
property as it appears to be
unusually unique. We would
hope that it would be pre-
served by several groups of
people, one of which is David-
son College.”’

The college appears to view
the property in terms of real
estate and Williams stated

that ‘‘any action or formal
commitment must be on re-
commendation of Mr. Currie
who is our advisor on land
acquisition.”

Total contributions from the
Davidson College Community
now total $1700. Daggy feels .
that the money can be raised
and attended a meeting this
Monday with the Stanley
County Commissioners, along
with College Business Mana-
ger Robert Currie.

‘“‘The Commissioners are
sympathetic to our cause,’’
said Daggy, “but they legally
cannott contribute. Hopefully
the can encourage contribu-
tions from the community and
assist in closing the transac-
tion.”’

Help appears to be coming .
from many different sources,
such as the promotional con-
sideration provided by Dav-
idson Lightweight Cycles in
the Biology Society’s raffle.
Daggy and Professor of Bio-
logy David Grant are explor-
ing all possibilities.

“An Officer for First Union
National Bank in Charlotte
has expressed a great interest
in the project, but nothing has

- yet been finalized. Dr. James

Matthews at UNC-C is work-

' ing to raise funds through

contacts in Monroe and the
Stanley County area,’’ said
Daggy.

“At this point, every little
bit will help,’’ Daggy noted.
‘We're just hoping to be able
to meet our deadlines in order
to preserve this property.”

Any individual or corporation
that would like to make a
contribution should make
their check payable to David-
son College Biology Depart-
ment Land Acquisition Fund,
in care of Dr. Tom Daggy.
