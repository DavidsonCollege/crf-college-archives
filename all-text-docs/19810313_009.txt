Southem hospitality and.
griefs greet Women’s Chorus

After exams were over most
Davidson students headed to
the beaches of Florida, to the
slopes of Colorado, or to hearth
and home in search of summer
employment; however, the 22
members of the ‘Davidson
Women’s Chorus spent their
break on a whirlwind tour of the
Southeast. Despite financial
difficulties, the: Music Depart-
ment sent three of its musical

groups oh Spring concert tours.
While these trips may eet: to
be free vacations to New York
CCity or New Qrieans, they
actually serve the College by
providing contact with distant
alumni and by recruiting new
students.

Saturday afternoon found us
bound for Atlanta’s Central
Presbyterian Church. We spent
the long bus ride rehearsing for
Sunday’s worship service and
getting lost in a maze of

strumental ensemble touring
during spring break had its’
modern-day renaissance in 1978
during Music Professor William
Lawing’s first year at David-
son. That year the wind and
jazz ensembles travelled to
Washington, D.C., and several
locations in Virginia. Subse-
quent tours were to Florida
(1979) and Tennessee (1980).

This is the story of this year’s
tour for the ensembles’ 49 brave
souls and their slightly mad
leader

Saturday, February 28—Our
bus was scheduled to roll at
10:30 am. We leave at 11:40,
headed for Marietta, Georgia.
The main order of business is
sleeping: everyone had practic-
ed three hours or more the day
before, and exams had taken
their toll.

We arrive at Marietta’s First
Presbyterian Church at 5:30
and are fed fried chicken, mash-
ed potatoes, and other goodies.
The show that evening and the
entire tour are dedicated to Mr.
Plott.

The stage is the size of a
postage stamp.

One of the reasons for the
tour is to recruit future fresh-
men, and that is a big reason »
why the ensembles are in Mari-
etta: the Atlanta area always
sends many people to David-
son. Before and after the show,
Dr. Lawing talks to students
and their parents about David-

Atlanta. One of our own mem-
bers provided comic relief in
what had grown into a difficult
situation (we had missed our
scheduled arrival time by one
hour) when she took it upon
herself to move a car which,
with its keys in the ignition,
was parked in the way of our
bus.

Some minor mishaps arise
without fail at every perfor-
mance—the piano was out of
tune, the mikes didn’t work, a
chorus member tripped during a.
performance. In the case of the
Sunday morning worship ser-
vice, we were locked out of the
enclosed choir loft after the
service was under way. Maybe
they were trying to tell us
something? -

A Sunday evening concert in
Birmingham brought:us to the
Seventy-sixth Street Presby-

was probably the least glamour-
ous place we visited, this
church’s congregation was the
most hospitable. Our host fami-
lies. were gracious even when it
came to delivering the chorus
members to the church Monday

thon bus ride to Winter Garden,

Exams behind them, Male Chorus heads North with a song in their hearts

By GLENN KELLUM
Features Editor

A good many students were still in
Chambers laboring overe exams. Some.
students were preparing for another
exam that afternoon. The atmosphere
was tense with study, and by and large
the campus was quiet.

Even amid this stillness, however,
thirty Davidson men were hurrying
toward the Fine Arts building with a
suitcase and hanging bag in hand. Some,
like myself, had just finished taking
their last exam. Others had slept late
that day—having finished their exams

previous day—but nevertheless were
still in a hurry. We had all gathered to
embark on yet another Davidson College
Male Chorus Spring Tour.

From the start, this year’s tour was to
be different. Mr. Plott had resigned in
early January, and for the first time in
his thirty years at Davidson, he would
not be with the chorus on tour. since the
fall of 1980, Mr. Plott had been battling
with a brain tumor, which finally caused
him to step down as music director.

Shortly before 1:00 p.m., Music Profes-

sor Wilmer Welsh gathered the chorus
together and told us that Mr. Plott had
died.

The chorus members and everyone
else involved decided the tour should go
on as scheduled. We knew Mr. Plott
would have wanted it that way. So we
picked ourselves up and pushed on to the
bus, feeling reasonably assured that this
was the right thing to do.

Since January, our director has been
Dr. Mary Nell Saunders, who also
assumed Mr. Plott’s positions as direct-
or of the Charlotte Oratorio Singers and
the choir at Trinity presbyterian Church.
Charlotte Symphony conductor Leo
Driehuys said Saunders ‘‘has a lot of

energy and she’s very warm.” Although |

Saunders had never taken a tour with
the Male Chorus, she had been adequate-
ly forewarned about the usual bus antics

and heaps of college humor which were in
store.

Our first stop was Chatham, Virginia.
We were to sing at Chatham Hall, a
private girls’ high school. For a com-

_as Buxtehude, Handel,

munity of girls with hardly any male
‘visitors, our arrival was a great event.
As one chorus member said of his short
walk around the campus, ‘I was
suddenly interrupted by shouts from a
second story dorm room window. When
I turned to look, I took a double take,
because what greeted my eyes were not
two faces, but four cheeks.’”’ The concert
that evening was a required function for
the girls. Needless to say, the atmo-
sphere in the campus chapel was akin to
a pep rally. Musically, the concert was
not one of our best, but first night
concerts are always a bit shaky.

The next day we left for Washington,
D.C. Our concert there was much better,
One reason was the church wasn't filled
with 100 screaming male-starved girls.
Another reason was that we were more
relaxed and comfortable with the concert
program, which includes such composers
Byrd, and
Brahms.

After Washington, we left for a free
day'in New York. Some went to the
Frick Museum. Others went to the

Empire State Building. Five or six
chorus members weut to Broadway
shows.

When we left the Big Apple, we
headed for Boston, which the natives call
the ‘‘intellectual center of the U.S.”
Although the concert went fairly well,
the audience was a typically stiff Boston
crowd. You know the kind—no smiles,
no applause, just blank faces.

From there we went to Princeton; then
to Milford, Delaware; then to Norfolk,
Virginia; and we ended the tour at the
Great Hall of the Wren Building in
Williamsburg.

On the ferry crossing the James River
after leaving Williamsburg, the chorus
congregated at one end of the boat and
sang the Alma Mater. Most of us didn’t
think then why we sang. But thinking
back now, I can pretty well guess. We
didn’t want to quit. We had to find some
way to sing again. We weren’t really
performing for anyone but ourselves. We
felt wonderful.

- Hall.
