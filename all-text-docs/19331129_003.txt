major portion of Scandinavia:~-The
speaker pointed out that there were
many things that we might learn from
these pfople in the care of homes,
outdoor life and abundance of good
food. As an example he mentioned
that one hotel at which they stopped
While touring Scandinavia, offered one
hundred and twenty-five different in-
troductory or cocktail courses prior to
the regular meal. The speaker em-
phasized forcefully that the people of
Norway, Sweden and Denmark were
less mixed racially than any other race
of people in the world.

Dr, Lingle, “ Davidson’s most wide-
ly-traveled man,” combined a histor-
ical background with his own personal
experience to make a highly success-
ful talk.

This month there will be a tea for
both the men and women of the club
and an open Chriftmas of the club is
planned.

TOYNBEE DISCUSSES
FOREIGN PROSPECTS

Way ‘to gain what is wanted. Person-
ally, I do not think war is going to
break out now. Why? Because war
is more terrible when two sides are
so evenly matched, and

each side

thinks it has a good chance of victory.
Before the last war, the nations were
divided into fairly equal camps which
resulted in a far more devastating war
than when one side is weak and the
other strong. This is a danger signal
for future wars of serious nature.

“After the war, Russia and Ger-
many felt something in common be-
cause of having been ‘de-classed.’ Ger-
many now realizes that her expansion
cannot be westward, as attempted in
the World War, but it must be east-
ward. Russia is in an uncomfortable
position because Hitlerite Germany is
on one side and miiltaristic Japan is
on the other.

“Italy has been unfriendly toward
France because of the inequality of the
of post-war plunder. How-
ever, Italy and France are trying to
prevent Austria from~ uniting with
Germany because the German popu-
lation would be

must ¢cither throw in her lot with Ger-
many and antagonize France, Britain,
and the United States, or she must
prevent Austria from allying with
France by joining with France and
creating a customs union in Austria..”

Dr. Toynbee concluded by saying,
“Some outlet for frustrated youth of
Germany should be provided by other
nations as well as by Germany, or war
is necessary.”

A reception was given for Dr. Toyn-
bee in the banquet hall by the Inter-
national Relations Club after the lec-
