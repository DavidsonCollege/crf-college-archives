WORK ON FLAG POLE
PROCEEDING RAPIDLY

Satisfactory progress is being made in
the preparation of the flag pole. Work-
men are busily engaged in excavating for
the foundations of the pole on the front
campus between Shearer Hall and Oak
Row. It will be necessary to dig a hole
nine feet deep to get a good foundation
for this pole which will have a concrete
base. ‘I'hese two sections, which are
now being dressed, are 80 and 70 feet
long, respectively. “hey were secured
on the farm of Mr. J. R. Withers. The

pole when finished will be 130 feet high:

with reversible top and wire rope for the
raising or lowering of a 30 foot flag. ‘The
two sections will be riveted together
with iron bands. ‘The next step in shap-
ing up the pole will be painting with at
least two coats of white paint. Four
smaller poles will be used as stays for
the main pole.

Y.M.C.A. ADDRESSED .
BY REV. W. C. WAUCHOPE

In the Y. M. C. A. meeting _ last
Thursday night, Rev. W. C. Wauchope.
of Cornelius, gave a very interesting ad-
dress on “Doubts.” During the lives of
every one there comes a time when there
are doubts. These occur more often in
the lives of thinking men because a
thinking man does not believe anything
unless he can prove it. These problems
should be laid aside for a short time and
they will soon answer themselves. Thru
this period of doubts a person should
hold fast to his unfaltering faith and
follow the path of duty, whether it is a
pleasant one or not. Sometimes it may
seem hard to obey this heavenly vision.
but nevertheless it should be followed

Special Attention te Davidson Men

The teacher was telling her pupils the
story of Red Riding Hood. After de-
scribing the woods and the wild animals
that flourished therein, she added: ‘“‘Sud-
denly Red Riding Hood heard a great
noise. She turned about and what do you
suppose she saw standing there, gazing
at her and showing all his sharp, white
teeth?”

“Teddy Roosevelt!” volunteered one
of the boys—E. M. M., Cleveland, O.

Mrs. Flatbush—Who is that woman
you just bowed to?

Mrs. Bensonhurst—O, she’s my next
door neighbor.

But she didn’t return your bow.

No; she never returns anything. —
