sible for getting themselves to
class.” She also suggests that stu-
dents should be allowed to stay at
houses with music as long as they
would like after alcohol is no longer
served. Sheasks, “otherwise where
will people go to sober up, their
cars?”

Loring says, “I don’t mind a
limitation on weekday parties but
two is ridiculous. I do think the

restriction is a good idea; I know I .

have worked more because of it.”
Some students, especially fresh-
men men who remember rushing
fraternities in the fall, agree that
the limited weekday parties elimi-
nates some pressure to spend time
on the court during the week.

Connor social chair, sopho-
more Kimberly Nance, disagrees,
“Davidson students should be re-
sponsible enough to determine
when they will go out. The faculty
should not have any influence on
our social lives.”

According to Dean Terry, the

limitations on weekday parties:

came directly from repeated re-
quests by professors. He is uncer-
tain about the faculty’s impression
of the influence the rule has had on
attendance and class attention.
Underage Drinking

Many students do not feel that
alcohol is any less available to
underage drinkers than it was last
year. Others find that a signifi-
cantly smaller volume of alcohol
leaves the basement of social
houses. Regardless, most students
do not believe that overall con-

sumption has decreased.

Although she does not feel
that alcohol is significantly more
difficult to obtain, hall counselor
Keri Slater observes, “the policy
has prevented some people who
didn’t drink in high school from
drinking as heavily as soon.”

~ Junior John Harper who spent—

first semester abroad, has seen a
significant difference in the atmo-
sphere at parties this year as op-
posed to last. Harper is twenty one
and “sometimes feels accosted by
underage drinkers at parties, espe-
cially coming up from the base-
ment to a crowd surrounding the
stairs.”

“I. don’t think the policy has at
all curbed underage drinking; it
has only been relocated,” says Dean
Terry. Many students expressed
similar observations noting that the

over Widespread Area As To Policy's Goals

change in geography of the drink-
ing has led to less attended and
later parties. Underage drinkers
also commented on the increased
expense for alcohol.
The Future of the Policy

In March the Council on Cam-
pus and Religious Life will review

—the..policy._taking—intoconsider-
ation reports from the SGA, the

PCC, SHOC, and the campus po-
lice. The CCRL will then make
suggestions for a strongerand more
effective policy to the Board of
Trustees in April.

Currently the Alcohol En-_

forcement Committee is working
to clarify some of the confusions
of the policy. For instance, they
will define what constitutes ob-
struction of a monitor, who needs
ID, and for which violations party
sponsors are responsible. The most

common violations include under-
age drinking, lack of response to a

monitor, and disorderly conduct.
Overall Dean Terry perceives
the policy has worked as well as he
expected. “I'd like to say the policy
is here to stay and I hope we can
reconcile ourselves to itand make

purpose that alcohol will not be the
centerpiece of Davidson social
life,” he says.

Terry has, “been disappointed
with the kinds of support form
agencies which could create alter-
native social options, though there
has been some improvement.”
Terry applauded the growing suc-
cess of the Outpost as a supple-
ment rather than a competitor for
the Court activities.

Current Alcohol Policy Changes Little for Independent

locations the independent under-
age drinker can go. The furiously
engrossing 900 Room is as mori-
bund as its planned events are dull.
Despite its energy on 21 year old
night, (I have heard rumors) on
weekend evenings its lack of popu-
larity is only surpassed by the
twenty four hour study room.
Other school sponsored evening
events are fun, but do not provide
the same social atmosphere. This
ultimately leaves the fraternities
and eating houses.

With Patterson Court in mind,
consider the situation. If there is
an open party to attend, it usually
doesn’t open until around 10:00.
What the hell am I supposed to do
until ten? Study? Please. I’m an
independent, but I’m not perverse.
Rather. I’m going to drink. Truly,
it is during this three to four-hour
stretch that I will do my most seri-

ous consumption, away from the
alcohol monitors and fear of au-
thority, in the comfort and quiet of
my ownroom. By the time Ireach
Patterson Court, I don’t have to
worry about drinking. I may still
drink a beer or two, but the desired

‘affect has already been attained,
beyond the limitations of the sys- '

tem. Thus, my room serves the

purpose as well as any bar, and the
court, dry or otherwise, awaits.
Unpleasant as it may seem to
a fraternity brother or eating house
“sister?”, the system has served
me well ever since I came to
Davidson. Getting alcoholatcourt
parties was never a problem for
me, but it never. was big concern.
Someone always existed who

would buy for me, and I always
had enough of what I wanted. If
twenty one year oldscan only carry
one can of beer up the stairs at a
time, so be it. One can is all Ineed.
And drinking in my room doesn’t
bother me; Sentelle’s two tone
putrid green walls would only in-
spire convulsion anyway. Finally,
I wonder if the new policy has had

any effect on court members ei-
ther. As muchas people may com-
plain, the parties I attend now seem
almost as good as they were in the

past. Perhaps more people follow
this example than I am aware of.
