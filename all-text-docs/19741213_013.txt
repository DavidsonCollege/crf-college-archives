Football Ends on 2-7 Note
As Farrell Has First Season

By CHARLIE SLAGLE
Staff Writer

The Davidson football teartt
ended the season with their
second win and seventh loss.
The win was a 28-20 victory
over Defiance College which
the Wildcats almost gave
away in the closing minutes.
The loss was a. 56-21
humiliation at the hands of
The Citadel.

The Defiance game started
slowly as neither team could
mount a serious drive the en-
tire first quarter.

Early in the second quarter,
Defiance was stopped on a
fourth down and one by
George Weicker on the David-

‘son 44 yard line. Davidson

took: only five plays to score
from there as David Harper

hit Stan Brown on a bomb ‘

down the sideline for a 44 yard

‘Seat Shift? Burns Students
With Misdirected Priorities.

And so I am here, trying to
sum the whole situation up.
How do we explain the fact
that the students “got shaf-
ted” on the seats in the
‘Coliseum? Earlier this year
this column pointed out the
possibility of poor seating for
students in the Coliseum.
Coach Bo Brickels told mé
that he believed the seating
would be satisfactory.

I’m sorry coach, you’re
wrong. The seating is not only
not good, it is lousy. There is
nothing worse than viewing a
B-Ball game from the end
zone. Looking through a glass
backboard to view a game is
less than pleasant.

But, I remember that it was
not so long ago when we sat on
the parquet floor on the
sidelines. So I wondered what

_ the explanation was and my
inquiry led me to the con-
clusion that the —ad-
ministration of this college
rests in the hands of a bunch of
liars.

Actually, liars is a term
which does not adequately
sum up our administration.
Administration polity toward
the students is that of decep-
tion. They not only ‘lie, but
they are sneaky about it. This
is so blatantly obvious. They
lie to the student up to the last
possible moment and then it’s
too late to correct the error.
This is what happened with
the yearbook, and this is what
happened with ‘‘our’’ seats.

During halftime of Saturday
night’s basketball game I
asked Mr. Cartmill (our new
(athletic director) why the
students seats were taken

away from them. He replied
that student unity was tne
crux of the matter, a stronger
cheering section was the goal.
Bullshit! Mr. Cartmill must

think the students at Davidson
are idiots, because even I saw
through this less than truthful
answer.

Two words can sum up the
reason behind the ‘‘great seat
shift’, and they are “alumni”
and “money’’. Perhaps Mr.
Cartmill has lost grasp of the
obvious, but how could he
deny that our seats were taken
away to be sold to our
illustrious alumni?

I say the hell with the alum-
ni, and the the hell with those
who cater to the alumni. I do
not question that the alumni
contribute generously to
Davidson. However, it may in-
terest our administration that
I too ‘‘donate’’ over $3500.00,
annually. One does not donate:
money in order to receive
special service; otherwise it is
not a donation which occurs,
but instead a payment for ser-

_vices rendered.

Certainly it is unfair to ac-
cuse a whole administration of
being liars (there are those
associated with the ad-
ministration who are not), but
when those in sensitive areas
exhibit credibility highly
questionable (in other words,
they lie through their teeth),
then no choice remains but to
generalize about others in-

‘directly involved. Yes, Dr.

Spencer you must bare the
brunt of this latest develop-
ment, but let’s not dwell on

what has already transpired.!.

The question remains; what
can be done?

As far as I can see, nothing.
Those seats have already
been sold and the only thing
the College can do is steal
those seats back, and cer-
tainly we couldn’t expect that.

Maybe what we should do as
a show of protest is steal our
seats back. The next om 9 we

. acer

‘go to the Coliseum for a game’

why doesn’t everyone take a
good seat, and when alumni
march up to you, politely hand
them your end zone ticket.
Perhaps what might be better
is a series of chants which get
our point across to the alumni.
I suppose that there is ‘really
nothing further one can say
except to ask when the decep-
tion will end. When will
students be treated \sleea the
