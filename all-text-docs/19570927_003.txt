All over the country, moans have been heard to
arise over the sad physical state in which we find our-
selves. From the halls of the White House to the shores
of California it’s been complained that we greatly neglect
our bodies in these days of luxury.

Perhaps it can be encouraging to Davidsonians who
freshman class has far outstripped the last two crops
are concerned along such lines to note that this year’s
of yearlings in coach Tom Scott's prescribed P.T. tests.

62°° PASSED

Dr. Scott recently released the figures on the re-
sults of the test as administered to the class of 1961.
Over sixty-two per cent of the men who took the test
successfully reached or surpassed the 290 point total. This
compares very favorably with the results of the last two
years, when hardly fifty per cent qualified for the regular
P.T. course.

Of the two hundred and forty-five students who took
the test, one hundred and fifty-three passed. Scores
ranged often into the 400’s, at least enough to hoist the
average score to 313.9 points.

THREE NEW RECORDS

Three new records were set, with Ed Garrett re-
sponsible for two of them. The speedy frosh was clocked
at 10.5 seconds in the 100-yard dash for a new mark,
and went on to rack up 532.2 points, a new high. Another
freshman, Bill Cannon, with 513.9 points, also broke the
old mark, formerly held by Max Bryan.

In addition to the two records Garrett set, four men
shared the honor of establishing a new mark in the dodge
run. A. J. Dickens, V. E. Stanley, R. M. Henderson, and

J.-E. Vaughn raced around the hurdles in 21.5 seconds.
Dr. Scott mentioned that he was planning to send

this information to each freshman, along with his individ-
ual score, and the average score for each event. This is
being done in the hope that it will encourage each of
the students to better his own marks.

SWIMMING TEST

He also revealed plans for a new swimming test, to
be given to all P.T. students during their weekly swim-
ming period. The test, which is to be pitched between
the junior and senior life saving tests, will consist of
most of the tests which are included in a regular life
saving program.

Upon passing the swimming test, a student will be
thereafter excused from the weekly swimming period,
and will be allowed to choose his activity for that period
Those who fail to pass will remain in the swimming class.

Although Davidson does not claim to be a mecca of
athletes, it might well appear that athletic ability on the
campus, is on the upswing and perhaps we'll show ‘em
that there is, afterall, such a thing as a brawny “brain.”

of Paul Barbee and Raiph

the victors a well-balanced
ground attack to mix with
the short passes of Ben-

ble with his long tosses.

Davidson's scoring opened
with a jump-pass from Benson
to Harold Westervelt for 37
