.. vagueness blurs power increase

[Continued from page 6]

I think not. Both Lawri-
more and student staffers of
WDAYV tell me that much of
the station’s equipment and at
least some of the music is
simply too old, of too poor
quality to use on a high-power
station.

When Lawrimore finishes
his ‘‘careful evaluation’’, I
believe he will have to spend at
least $13,000 to upgrade the
equipment (and that is a
conservative figure). So to go
on the air with any kind of
technical adequacy will cost at
least $65,000.

$65,000 is a lot of money.
I will not list the projects and
departments that could sorely
use that considerable sum.

Add then the operating
budget —$25,000 yearly. In
two years, $50,000 just to
staff and operate the station,
and that’s assuming no increa-
ses in salaries or costs.

Add then the automation
option at $36,000.

Money from where?

And have we considered
that an ambitious publicity
campaign may be required to
get the station off the ground?
Bill Burkholder suggests ‘‘ag-
gressive use of billboards and
program guides during the
station’s first few months of
operation to insure exposure
to the Charlotte population
follows logically and will also
cost money.”

Capital cost of $65,000 plus
$50,000 operating costs in
only two years, we could be
spending $125,000 for a radio
station. And with the optional
automation equipment the
price tag would creep into the
$150,000 range.

But the proponents come
screaming, ‘‘No, no. Those
figures aren’t representative.

We will be able to raise money ~

for the station.”

The college is in the process
of applying for a Federal grant
from the Government Office of
Education. Proponents holt
the grant will pay 75 percent
of the start-up capital costs for
the WDAV expansion. The
application is not yet com-
plete, but Lawrimore has indi-
cated that the college will
request upwards of $150,000.

If everything goes perfectly
and we receive 75 percent
funding, the college must still
pay over $37,000 for a radio
station.

Costs considerable

A Federal grant would
doubtlessly reduce the cost of
a radio station, But the capital
cost would still be consider-
able, at least as high as
$37,500. And the Federal
grant does not pay for yearly
operating budget. That means
that $25,000 yearly must be
raised just for the station to
break even.

Lawrimore’s proposal out-
lines plans for program spon-
sorship by commercial firms, a

subscription service, a sub-
carrier broadcasting service,
and a Davidson Sports Net-
work. ‘‘I don’t know at this
point how many dollars any of
these can bring in,’’ says
Lawrimore, quickly adding,
“but I don’t think it’s unrea-
sonable to assume that we can
raise enough for the $25,000
operating budget.

He doesn’t think it’s unrea-
sonable, but I have encoun-
tered no information that sup-
ports his thinking.

Revenue unsure

In fact, information I have
obtained indicates that those
proposing the expenditure ad-
mit it is impossible to estimate
how much revenue the station
can bring in, that the best
guess that can be made with
present information is that
half the initial capital outlay
and half the annual operating
costs could be raised from
outside sources.

At least one administrator
is doubtful that even half the
operating budget can be raised
from outside sources.

You may ask, “With these
high costs and uncertain reve-
nue sources, why is the ad-
ministration interested in a
high-power station?

Says Spencer, in reply,
‘You go by the judgment of
what other people can tell you.
I rely rather heavily on Dr.
Stair’s judgment.”’ Dr. Fred
Stair, a Davidson grad and
Trustee, is President of Union
Theological Seminary. Union
has an educational-type radio
station we are apparently us-
ing as a model.

“He considers that (station)
of great value to them in
Richmond...And they get
back enough of their expen-
ditures so that they think that

whatever else they spend is
well worth it.”’

Comparisons needed

I’m sure Dr. Stair is a fine
man, but if I were committing
my college to a proposal as
far-reaching as an expensive
high-power radio station, I’d
like to have facts and figures
about the Union station as
well as Dr. Stair’s good judg-
ment.

Just how much money do
they spend, how much do they
take in, what is their operating
budget, and many other ques-
tions come to mind. Wake
Forest has a station (WFDD-
FM) similar in some (though
not all) ways to the one we are
considering. Why don’t we get
figures on their expenditures,
income, staffing, program-
ming, and so on.

Lawrimore admitted to me
yesterday that no such formal
studies have ever been made.
“It would be nice to have that
information, but we’ve been so
busy with other aspects of the
WDAV plans that we just
haven’t had the time that it
takes to conduct a survey.”

I suggest that these studies

should have been made before
any other plans or programs
were proposed.

Put these figures out for all
to see, so we can see wh
other institutions have inves-
ted. Before we make a com-
mitment, let’s make sure that
the college community is aw-
are of the outlay required.

Spencer says that once the
radio station is started, ‘‘it’s
just like anything else you do
at a college. If you make a
commitment to do something
you fund it...you’ve got to
operate it.’’

Before we make that com-
mitment let’s stop now and
study carefully similar sta-
tions at other schools.

Don’t just assume that the
station will be a.good invest-
ment because people at other
stations say they are satisfied
with their operations. David-
son is not other places. What
works at Union might just not
work at Davidson. Let’s make
some attempt to assess the
station’s benefit to our fund-
raising campaign.

Spencer unclear

My worry is that President
Spencer is not really clear on

just how involved this radio
station is. He thinks that
$52,000 will get us on the air.
‘Everyone else I’ve talked to
says extra money for studio
and album improvements is
almost a certainty to be spent
before we go on the air.
Spencer thinks we have ‘‘a
very adequate classical collec-
tion. Lawrimore and students
say we need considerable im-
provements in classical music
before we go high power.

fi’ not trying the old repor-
ter S“trick of playing one
source against another to
make Spencer look stupid. I
am just very concerned that he
is pushing a proposal that
involves much more than he
now realizes.

Spencer says he doesn’t
believe the radio station will
be an elaborate, complicated
operation. Not complicated?
On Wednesday, the TRANS-
CO oil company seriously
complicated the lives of radio
station proponents by refusing
to install the station's broad-
casting antenna. :

I suggest that this is only
the first of what will prove to
be a series of complications for
the college if WDAV is expan-
ded.

Role of Media Board

The First Davidson College
Media Board is now formed.
The Board has broad powers
over the media realm, and I
suggest that the Board under-
take as its first project a
thorough study of the propo-
sal to expand WDAV.

The implications of Lawri-
more’s proposal are to me

unsettling. I want to know if
you on the Board believe that
a $25,000 yearly operating
budget is wise for a college
that should watch every pen-
ny. I want to know if student
participation on the station
will be at the absolute max-
imum and professional assis-
tance at a minimum. I want to
know if the station’s program-
ming will be geared almost
exclusively to the Charlotte
population with only token
concessions to the Davidson
student body.

But most importantly, I
urge the Media Board to
question the administration’s
underlying assumption that
the radio station will contri-
bute more resources than it
expends.

I want substantive facts
and figures from the Union
station and explaining thor-
oughly their staffing, prog-
ramming, intake, expendi-
tures, etc.

I want to remind Coving-
ton, Downs, Bessilieu, Han-
kins—the four students on the
Board that WDAV should be,
above all a student station,
staffed by and directed for
primarily towards the inter-
ests of the Davidson student.
I would like to remind Win-
kler, Terry, Currie, and Sat-
terwhite that this school is
first and foremost’ a teaching
institution. Remember that
ostentatious, money-flinging
proposals that promise to
enhance financial support sel-
dom solve problems. Carefully
spent properly directed monies
do most to improve the calibre
of a college.

Disturbing opinions

The opinions of another
member of the Board particu-
larly disturb me. In an inter-
view with Buck Lawrimore for
the February 21 Davidsonian
(before his selection to the
Media Board) I asked Lawri-
more: ‘‘What should the role
of the Media Board be in
determining the plans for the
radio station?’’ His reply:
“The radio station will require
so much attention and
thought that it needs a Board
of its own (WDAV Board) at
this time. When things are
running smoothly the Media
Board could be expanded to
include the radio station.’

This week he said, ‘‘We are
trying more than ever to
concentrate the decision-mak-
ing process in the Board of
Directors of the radio station
to be sure that faculty, staff,
and students have input into
all major decisions...to make
sure there is mutual under-
standing and agreement.’’

It does not surprise me that
he wishes to concentrate de-
cision-making in the Board.
Apparently they have stopped
questioning the basic premise
that the radio station is a wise
investment. A student on the
Board has admitted his belief
that the whole proposal to
upgrade WDAYV is a tremen-

dous waste of money. He feels,
however, that the higher-ups
(Spencer and Lawrimore) have
already made the crucial deci-
sion, i.e., we will spend a
considerable amount of money
for a radio station, and sees
his role as one of trying to
make sure the money will go
where it does the students the
most good.

That some on the WDAV
Board have accepted the fact
that the college is wasting its
money by building a radio
station is to me most dis-
turbing.

Media board obligations

The Media Board must ful-
fill its obligations to oversee
the student media. No more
talk of ‘‘just getting off the
ground...electing a chairman
...not really sure what we are
supposed to do...”’ Look in the
College Constitution.

‘‘The Media Board is re-
sponsible for the student me-
dia and reports to the Trustees
through the President...it ap-
proves the budgets of these
media and reviews their finan-
ces.’’ (From the College Con-
stitution) As best I can tell,
every change in the proposed
expansion is directly related to
some monetary outlay of the
radio station the high power
itself, the improvements, the
staffing, the operating bud-
get, the very decision to go
high power, the whole bit.

The station falls under the
Media Board’s jurisdiction
right now, and I don’t want
you, Mr. Lawrimore, to work
out your plans in the DAV
Board meetings, draft an im-
pressive proposal and drop it
in thelap of the Media Board,
saying ‘‘here look over this,
just remember that we radio
people worked it up, and we
know the problems inside and
out.”’ I don’t want the expan-
sion plans to be ‘‘running
smoothly” before the Media
Board investigates them. I
want the Media Board to go
over them step by step, care-
fully weighing the basics.

Questions

The questions I have men-
tioned and others like them are
the very same ones I began
asking two months ago. I’ve
asked them of Spencer at
various times, of Lawrimore,
of. the WDAV Board, and
various of the DAV staff.
Either they don’t know, won't
tell, or give nebulous descrip-
tions of tentative and very
tentative proposals. I’m tired
of tentatives.

Lawrimore told me once ‘‘we
don’t view this (the radio
station) as a multi-thousand
dollar rat-hole to pour money
into. I think back...52,000...
21,000...25,000 yearly...
36,000...advertising campaign
...@ new tower.... |

Media Board, the respon-
sibility is yours. The rat-hole
must not open.
