Humanities Steering Committee Chairman Anthony Abbott

Humanities Evaluation

Continues

Steering Committee Formed

By DAVID RESNIK
The first- and second-year
‘Humanities staffs have formed a steering
committee which will allow Humanities
“to facilitate its own evaluation and revi-
sion,” said Committee Director and Pro-
fessor of English Anthony Abbott.

The Committee is sending docu-
ments to the Humanities staff itself, the
faculty, and Humanities students, asking
for a program evaluation in terms of its
strengths, weaknesses, and areas of pos-
sible improvement.

The committee consists of Abbott;
First Year Director of Humanities and
Professor of Religion Max Polley; Pro-
fessor of History Peter Krentz; Professor

The committee will collect its infor-
mation this spring in order to start a
major revision of the program during the
summer.

According to Abbott, the committee
will “study and collate” its findings “with
the material from the visiting committee”
and decide “what direction” the Program
will take.

Humanities Under Fire

The Visiting Committee of Harold
Martin, Marvin Levich, and Jed Rabb re-
leased their evaluation of Davidson’s
Humanities program at the beginning of
February. ,

Partly in response to their report, and
also in response to a general consensus
gained from discussions with
Humanities professors, the Administra-
tion decided that ‘“‘a major revision” was
in order, according to Vice President for
Academic Affairs and Dean of the Facul-
ty T. C. Price Zimmermann.

Zimmermann announced the plans
for revision and the appointment of Pro-
fessor of Philosophy and Acting Chair-
man Earl MacCormac as the single direc-
tor of the Humanities Program in a letter
to the Humanities staff.

The faculty endorsed a Humanities
program request that Zimmermann re-
scind his letter by a vote of 79-8 in a spe-
cial called meeting.

The twelve members of the
Humanities staff who submitted the letter
called “the manner of the decisions and
their method of presentation both a viola-
tion of the faculty’s constitutional pre-
rogatives and a discourtesy to those indi-
viduals involved in the Humanities Pro-
gram.”

SGA, Administration
Examine Patterson Ct.

By JEFF HOLLAND

Freshmen self-selection took place be-
fore Spring Break amid questions con-
cerning both the process itself and the fu-
ture of Patterson Court eating houses.

Two houses, ATO and ETC face prob-
lems with declining membership, and the
SGA is conducting a survey to evaluate
student opinions on the self-selection
system.

SGA Questionaire

The SGA passed out the questionaire
last week to all on-campus students.
Warren Gould, chairman of the Patterson
Court Study Committee conducting the
survey, said they are still collecting the
last of the surveys and hope to have the
results tallied by the end of the week. He
also said that student interviews are
being conducted all this week.

Gould said that if the committee de-
cides to propose any changes in the sys-
tem, they will first consult with the PCC,
and.then submit theit proposal to the Col-
lege President and the Trustees, after ap-
proval by the Council on Campus and
Religious Life.

Stability of Patterson Court

ATO and ETC both face memberships
of less than 65 in the fall, which is below
the level recommended by Business
Manager Bob Currie to maintain a house
in good financial condition. A rule in-
cluded in house contracts signed at the
beginning of the year sets a minimum
membership for a house at 60 members
this year, 65 members next year, and 70
members the year after that.

8 Percent Hike

ATO President Richard Barber said
that they have been operating with less
than 60 members all year and have man-
aged to come out in the black after a de-
ficit last year. Although only seven
freshmen signed up to eat at ATO,
Barber said they are working hard to pick
up new members.

ETC has lost 10 to 12 people this term,
according to House President Laura
McDonald. She said they have 45 mem-
bers this term and will add 17 freshmen
in the fall. In addition she said they ex-
pect to acquire a few new members with
SPE spring rush. She said that they plan
io wait it out and try to operate next year
with what they have.

Dean of Students Will Terry said that
the 60-member rule is only a general one,
and houses will not be forced to close if
they fail to meet this minimum. “This is
only a thing that Bob [Currie] worked out
based on the fixed costs of running a

“house,” Terry said. He said there is a

general feeling on the Court that if a
house can operate effectively and in the
black with less than 60 members it
should be allowed to do this. However,
he added there should be some
mechanism for change. “If a group of 85
people get together and want to start a
house, and there is a house with only 50
members in it, it is not fair to block out
those extra 35 people,” he said.

Terry emphasized that the rule is not
intended to close down Patterson Court.
“On the contrary,” he said, “we want to

Inflation Forces
Tuition Increase

By DAN VOORHIS

Davidson’s comprehensive fee will
rise eight percent to $8,105 for the 1983-
84 school year, a fee which includes
$1,325 for board, tuition, and room
costs. Average faculty and staff compen-
sation will also jump by the same percen-
tage

Davidson — has
raised its tuition 66
percent
past four years
from $5,360 (°79-
80) to $8,105 (°83-
84). This increase
reflects the rise in
expenses for the College to educate stu-
dents. “The cost of tuition and other fees
are very responsive to inflation.” said
College Comptroller Robert W. David-
son.

over the ©

President Samuel R. Spencer stated
in a letter to parents that tuition now rises
faster than inflation to compensate for
the decline in real salaries over the last 15
years.

“We have three sources of income,
generally,” said Davidson. “The endow-
ments, our own and the Duke endow-
ment; gifts from alumni and others; and
tuition. It’s awfully tough to increase just
the other two in double-digit inflation.”

The Duke endowment is a fund de-
signed to help Duke, Furman, Johnson

C. Smith College, and Davidson. The
fund supplies the College with almost $1
million per year toward educational ex-
penses. Davidson's $30 million endow-
ment contributes over $500,000 annu-

ally.
