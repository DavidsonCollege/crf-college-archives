Festival Showcases South Asian Culture: Beginning Next Week

By CARLA WALKER

Davidson’s South Asian Stud-
ics Program, one of the strongest in
the South, will put its strength on
display from September 16 through
September 28 with its first South
Asia Festival.

The festival includes lectures,
films and musical performances
about this vast part of our world
that contains one-fifth of its popu-
lation and is home to many major
religions. All lectures and perform-
ances are free and open to the
public.

More than 25 Davidson stu-
dents hail from the region, includ-
ing the countries of India, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Davidson
also sends approximately 15 stu-
dents to the Madras arca of India
for a semester every other year.
Led by a Davidson faculty mem-
ber, they study Indian history and
culture, conduct independent re-
search and visit sites of cultural
importance.

In addition to the Madras pro-

Davidson
Art Program
Will Travel
to Italy
This Spring

By JENNY SCARBOROUGH

A program instituted by the
Davidson College Art Department
will give fiftecn students the op-
portunity to live and study in Rome
during the spring semester.

The program, which is directed
by Art professor Nina Serebren-
nikov, is open to sophomores,
juniors and scniors, regardless of
major.

The students will take four
courses: one in Italian, two in art
history and onc independent study.
Prerequisites for the program are
either Art210 or Art 100. In the art
history classes--Early Christian and
Byzantine Art in Italy and a semi-
nar in Italian renaissance and ba-
roque art--students will study
works of art in class before seeing
and examining the actual monu-
ments, churches and mosaics.

The Italian course is designed
to help students learn the language
as they are living in the country. It
will be taught at a language school
in Rome. Serebrennikov said, “The
Italian classes will allow us to be
stepping into Rome rather than
being a group of American tour-
ists.”

The group will also spend a
week in Florence and four days in
Rodenna, which was the western-
most capital of the Byzantine
empire. Screbrennikov said that
being in Rome and vicwing the
monuments firsthand will add
much more meaning to the study
of art history. Seeing the works of
art and examining them in their
natural setting “is something which

just can’t compare tona slide.”

gram, the college curriculum in-
cludes 15 courses on the region, a
variety of speakers on South Asia
visit campus, and many faculty
members have travelled to or stud-
ied about South Asia. The program
is part of the college’s overall cf-
fort to increase its students global
perspective and teach them about
non-western culturcs.

Saving Energy Makes Better Davidson and Richer Faculty:
New Contest Awaited By Eager College Community

COLLEGE RELATIONS

Kicking an idea for a college
cnergy managementsystem around

the ol’ baseball diamond has earned ,

a coalition of four faculty coaches
$2,000 in the Better Davidson
Contest.

The principal administrative
staff selected an entry from Eco-
nomics professor Peter Hess,
Humanitics and Physics professor
Bob Manning, English professor
Randy Nelson and Religion pro-
fessor Karl Plank over about 70
others as the contest winner.

Asecond place prizeof $1,000
goes to Harrict Kessler of institu-
tional advancement for a sugges-
tion to centralize procurement,
while Bob Stcvenson of adminis-
trative_services—and—Mary—Lin-

‘ eberger of the laundry splita $500

third prize. Stevenson suggested
setting up a college motor pool
while Lincberger, who works at
the laundry, suggested methods for
making that operation more effi-
cient.

Honorable mention awards of
$100 were also made to Gay Gayle
Daily, Dave Fagg, Harrison Heil,
Denise Howard, Peter Johnson,
Peter Krentz, Ed Ludwick, Heidi
Schultz, Charlie Slagle, Eileen
Vinson and Francis White.

Bob Sutton, vice president for
business and finance, said the col-
lege plans to implement all of the

winning entries, though some may
take more time than others. “If we
were able to institute a substantial
majority of these ideas, there would
be very dramatic savings in the
college budget,” he said.

The four faculty winners all
coached the Davidson Eagles nine-
and ten-year-old baseball team
this summer. When the contest was
announced, they began discussing:
ideas, and eventually did some
serious research into the subject of
energy management. Thatresearch
showed that better energy man-
agement could save the college
between $60,000 and $560,000
annually.

They recommended that
Davidson establish an energy
management task force to work
with Duke Power Company ona

r—_plan

beginning its work with an energy
audit, and suggested that Davidson
subscribe to Duke Power’s inter-
ruptible service system and buy
energy-efficient cquipmenttohelp
reduce the costs of lighting andair
conditioning.

Kessler estimated that a cen-
tral procurement system would
save Davidson $300,000 a year
through competitive bidding and
establishing a partnership with
suppliers. Under Stevenson’s car
pool proposal, all vehicles would
be checked out through a college
motor pool, which would be re-
sponsible for their maintenance and
fuel.

Energy management and en-
vironmental stewardship were
popular subjects in the contest. One
person recommended putting

unwisely.

One person wrote that some-
one in the comptroller’s office
should bring “outlandish and inap-
propriate charges” to the attention
of departmental vice presidents.
This person added, “I honestly feel
that if people in the college knew
they were being scrutinized for
what they spent and how, spending
would decrease.”

Other entries covered a wide
range of college activities. Anextra
half-day of paid vacation to em-
ployees who do not use any sick
Icave days for six months was one
proposal. Additional suggestions
included: two people should not
be-sent to do a job that one can
handle; the charging of a small fee
for bringing guests to the Baker
Sports Complex; giving hourly em-

—master—plan—for—saving- energy.

Their reasoning went beyond dol-
lars and cents. They wrote, “In our
time, saving energy is not only
cost-effective, but morally de-
manded as a social responsibility.

While the cost-effectiveness
would be an obvious advantage,
the more significant dimension
perhaps lies in the realm of envi-
ronmental stewardship: a program
which encourages conservation of
scarce and dwindling resources is
surely consistent with Davidson’s
emphasis on service to the larger
communities of which Davidson is
a part.”

They envisioned the task force

Another said the college should
adopt a standard of 78 degrees
Fahrenhcit in the summer and 68
degrees in the winter forall thermo-
stats, and another suggested weath-
erstripping leaky doors and win-
dows. :

The contest also uncovered a
core ofresentment againstemploy-
ees who abuse the college. People
suggested a lay-off of employees
who are doing personal errands on
company time, checking out of
work early, punching others’ time
cards, taking college-owned mate-
rial for personal use, loafing on the
job and spending college funds

permits and the decreasing of tol-
erance of illegal parking; the limi-
tation of the amount of paper used
by establishing common bulletin
boards; and the reduction of mail-
ing costs by sending items to other
employees via campus mail in-
stead of the costlier US mail.

Sutton said that he was happy
with the range and thoughtfulness
of the suggestions, and that he in-

tends to continue the Process into
the future.
