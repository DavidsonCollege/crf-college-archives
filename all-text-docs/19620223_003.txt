FORMER WILDCAT STARS MEET AGAIN

WHEN DEAN RUSK returned to his alma mater |
this week, two of the men he was most anxious to see
were D. Grier Martin and Frontis Johnston. You see,

Matmen Pin State;
Hit Pfeiffer Next

Following a Wednesday night
victory against N. C. State, Dav-
idson’s matmen will be seeking |
to close out their regular sea- |
son with a win at Pfeiffer this |
Tuesday. }

these two men not only attended Davidson when Rusk
did, but they were teammates of the Secretary of State |
on the Wildcat basketball team.

The 1930 Davidson contingent was led by Johnston,
who was an experienced senior forward, captain, and the
team’s leading scorer; Rusk, who was a starting junior
center and the team’s third best scorer; and Martin, who
was a promising sophomore with the team’s seventh
highest number of points

The ‘Cats were a pretty good club that vear as they
defeated some highly regarded teams, including North
Carolina and Wake Forest. Their thrilling 22-20 win over
the Tarheels was one of the season's highlights.

Another highlight came the night that Johnston
scored an amazing 22 points. That feat could be compared
to a 50-point performance these days. A good example of
the difference in total points scored in those days and the
number scored today is a comparison between Johnston
and current Wildcat star Bill Jarman. Johnston led the
team his senior year with 147 points, while Jarman has
pumped in over 500 points.

Following a tour into Virginia for three games dur-
ing that 1930 season, the following excerpt appeared on
the sports page of the February 13 edition of THE DAV-|
IDSONIAN:

Rusk reached the form he displayed last season
and ran wild in all the games to lead his teammates
in scoring for the trip. He rang up 34 points in the
three games, getting eleven points against both |
V.M.I. and Roanoke, and raising his mark to an even
dozen points in the final contest with Virginia Poly.

The following year. 1931, star Johnston was gone but
Martin was beginning to show his right to fill the former’s
shoes. Coach Younger shifted the 6-2 Rusk to forward in
order to make room in the pivot for the lanky Martin.

One of the big victories that year was a 26-19
triumph over N. C. State. The following paragraph ap-
peared in the January 15 edition of THE DAVIDSONIAN
concerning that game:

Grier Martin was high point man of the game
and put up a beautiful floor game, . . . while the
floor game of Rusk aided materially in the Wildcat
victory.

At the end of the season Rusk and Martin were still
in the limelight. Following a 35-26 victory over South
Carolina, the February 26 edition of THE DAVIDSONIAN
had the following to say about the game:

It was the remarkable second half shooting of
Dean Rusk that spelled defeat to the struggling
South Carolinians, The Davidson Rhodes Scholar
sank five field goals in the second half that kept the
Wildcats leading throughout. Grier Martin was high

int man for the night with 12 points, closely fol-
lowed by Rusk with 11.

It will be the Wildcat’s second |

Pfeiffer will give the grapplers
a 7-3 record for the season.

In Wednesday's action in

Following five straight losses,

sought to get back on the win-|

they splashed with Emory in|
the local pool. }

This coming Wednesday and |

The 'Catfish, who now own a

before the season ever began. |

However, several swimmers |
have been tremendous all sea-

-F Cage Action

I-F basketball action was light
this week as only four games
were played.

The undefeated Kappa Sigs
did not play, thus remaining in
number one position.

Checklist for this week's ac-
tion is as follows:

On Monday night, three SAE’s
scored in double figures— Ed
Hines (21), Billy Jo Morgan (12),
and Tommy Tuttle (11)—as they
came from behind for a 54-45
win over the Pikas, who also
had three men in double figures
—J. D. Whitehead (16), Keith
Fraser (13), and Jim Fouche
(10).

The Betas walloped the Sigma
Nus, 68-34, behind Tommy
Hamilton’s 20 and Steve Kash’s
19 points.

Lou Zirkle scored 14 and Bob
McAllister 15 as the Phi Gams
edged the KA’s in overtime, 47-
44. John Sharp had 18 for the
losers.

Mark Dunn, the league's top
scorer and David Johnson hit
24 each, and Earl Cole added
18 as the Independents raced
by the Sig Eps, 85-42.

AT THE CITADEL TOMORROW NIGHT

’Cats Complete

ASTRONAUT? — Davidson's TERRY HOLLAND (with ball) seems suspended in mid-air be-

tween Richmond players JOHN TELEPO (left) and GEORGE GRODZICKI. Wildcat captain D. G.
123—Tom Wright (D) won by MARTIN (14) closes in. This was just one of Holland’s rebounds which enabled the ‘Cats to
trounce the Spiders on Tuesday night, 72-62. (Staff Photo by McCutchen)

Probably the best and
certainly the most exciting
freshman basketball team
ever to be assembled at
Davidson College winds up
the season tomorrow night
in Charleston, S. C., where
they take on The Citadel
frosh just prior to the var-
sity clash.

Going into this final contest,
the Wildkittens have compiled
a 14-3 record, and are currently
riding an 1i-game. winning
streak. A-win over the Bullpups,
whom the ‘Kittens have already
thrashed once, 104-76, would
enable the frosh to equal their
big brothers’ record-setting vic
tory streak of 12.

This past Tuesday night the
‘Kittens put on an exhibition
that left Davidson fans saying,
“Just wait ‘til next year!” The
cause for elation was a sound,
80-63 victory over Duke Uni-
versity’s heralded freshmen,
considered by most to be the
best yearling club in the
Atlantic Coast Conference.

Pacing the Davidson attack
was Don Davidson, the 65 lean
and hungry Salem, Ohio, native,
whose 19 points in the second

jhalf left the Blue Imps stand

ing. Following a bad first half,
the former high school football
and basketball All-Stater came
back after intermission and

tempts, most of whi¢h came on

Duke’s 7-foot center, Hack

6-8 Fred Hetzel of Washing-
ton, D. C., was again outstand-
ing. Consistent throughout the
game, Hetzel was high scorer
with 21 points. The former prep
school All-American turned in
one of his best performances of
the year as he rebounded with
authority and put an excellent

defensive job on Tison, who
was also a high school All-
American

Guards Charlie Marcon and
Dave Thomas were outstand-

ing also. Two former Pennsy!-
vania high school All-Staters,
Marcon and Thomas combin-
ed for 12 and 11 points, re-
spectively, and turned in their
usual razzie-dazzie floor show.

Barry Teague, Paul Briggs,
Phil Squier, and John Barrow

also saw action, and Teague,

Furman Favored To Win
Indoor Track Tournament

team left this afternoon for

tomorrow's Southern Conference indoor track tourna-
ment in Lexington, Va., with little hope of capturing

tomorrow's best prospect, and
also mentioned that Childs has
a good chance in the hop-step-
and-jump and the broad jump.

Last Saturday at the Big
Five indoor track meet in Ra-
leigh, Davidson’s varsity was
represented by only one man,
Bob Cordie, who took a fifth
place in the 60-yd. dash.

On the freshman side how-
ever, all four boys who made
the trip showed up wel! in their
respective events. Tom Watson
won the 60-yd. dash; Mike Wil-
ljams was second in the low
hurdles; Fred Heffner was
second in the mile run; and
Chester Davis was third in the
two-mile run.
