TO THE CLASS OF 1888.

Fellow Classmen: Every. "man who

matriculated in this ¢lass is, of course, a' Florence, S.

member ; and I am writing a word to all.

I am ‘confidently counting on the old {is located in Greenville, 8. C.

class having its name on the Founder's
Plate of this building: and I want it so
stated, publicly and officially, at this
Commencement. We ought to put in
$1,000 as a mark for the others to come
to. We can do it. One member of the
class has given me his written pledge for
$200 and another has done the same for
$i0o. Are there not one or two others
who will pledge $200 and three who
will pledge $100 each? Several will give
$50, 1 am‘sure. We have two years
in which to pay these pledges. It will
hurt. possibly, but it will not kill; and
T feel that the class of 1888 can and will
do that much for the old college.

The students now here and those to
come need the gymnasium: and when.
we get it we have great plans for de-
veloping the systematic physical building
up_of every student.

Write me now what you will do. Do
rot wait for the other fellow, bur lead
the wav.
somewhere worth while!

Yours i in the bonds of the ald and in cine in  WaveroRs, Ga.

service for the new days,
M. J. Martin.
