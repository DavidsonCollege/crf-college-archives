TO THE DAVIDSON STUDENT BODY:

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C. 28036. FRIDAY. APRIL 26. 1968

I have never been more surprised and overwhelmed
than I was Tuesday when I came to Assembly to make a
brief talk and ended up with what must be the greatest
surprise of my life - the most beautiful color television

set I have ever seen or heard.

(A.M. and F.M.) and a record player.

In addition it has radio

My wife and I thank you very much for your generosity,
but I think we appreciate even more the tremendous demonstra-

tion which you gave us with your applause.

How glad we are that we will live in this community
and have the privilege of associating with you and the

Davidsonians who will follow you.

President D. Grier Martin
recelved a standing ovation
and a color television from
appreciative students during
chapel Tuesday

Martin was there to deliver
a speech on the role of mod-
erates in society as the key-
note speaker for the Omicron
Delta Kappa tapping.

The presentation of the
combined television, record-
player and tape recorder
console followed the speech
and took Martin by surprise.
The gift was financed by do-

nations from students.
Martin, who was elected in
1958, announced last January
he was resigning June 30. He
succeeded Dr. John R. Cun-
ningham as president.

Open Dorm Experiment
Scheduled For May 11

Both Richardson and Duke
dormitories will be open to
women visitors on Saturday.
May 1!, from 7 to 10 p.m..
according to Peter Hobbie,
president of the Residence
Halil Association—

Hobbie said that Richard
son and Duke were chosen
because ‘they have had less
damage done to them and the
greatest enthusiasm for open
dorms will probably be gen-
erated from their residents.

“There is the largest cross-
section of the upper three
classes in Richardson,"’ con-
tinued Hobbie, ‘‘and we hope
that these students will vol-
unteer their opinions of the
open dorm system and sug
gest any changes that they
would like to see made."

Hobbie reported that the
RHA committee chose Duke
hecause it is constructed by

Fund Drive
Shoots
To $1700

Over $1700 has been col-
lected so far in the Negro
Scholarship Fund, said Rick
Harrell Thursday night.

Explaining that over .$500
had come in Thursday, Har-
reli said that he was confi-
dent that the fund would go
over the required $2400.

‘There are voids where a
whole bunch of people just
haven’t reported yet.’’ he
said.

Most of the freshmen re-
ports are in, and a large pro-
portion of sophomores and
juniors, he said, but the
Senior Class is behind.

The scholarship drive came
when psychology professor
W. G. Workman responded
to a March 21 DAVIDSONIAN
editorial with an offer to put
up $100 for a Negro scholar-
ship if students would raise
$2400.

Senate Vote Kills
Diving Penalty

By DANNY WHITE
Staff Writer

The Senate twice defeated
this week a proposal which
would have recommended to
the faculty that students who
“dive’’ reviews should be re
quired to stay in the infirm-
ary for 24 hours.

The recommendation was
defeated 4-4 Tuesday and 4-6
Thursday. Seven votes are
required for passage.

SGA President Joe Murphy
presented: the proposal after
a conference with Dean of
Students Richard C. Burts,
Dr. J. D. Woods, and Honor
Court Chairman Bill Wil-
liams.

“Diving reviews is certain-
ly becoming a serious prob-
lem because Dr. Woods says
he has to believe everyone
who comes to the infirmary,”
said Murphy.

“This offense is not cover-
ed under the Honor Code,
but it is certainly a violation
of the spirit of the code.”’ he
said.

Freshman adviser Larry
Slade, who voted against the
proposal, said he thought the
Senate was taking a negative
view of the situation and not
considering: the students who
were really sick.

However, senator C. L.
Cheshire, favoring the rule,
claimed the diving was un.
fair to students who take the

Historic Croquet Win

Led by the “unscrupulous” methods of DA-
VIDSONIAN Photography Editor W. B. ‘Wild
Bill” Olson, ‘The Quips and Cranks" won its first
croquet match in the history of fhe school Sat-

Olson was chosen by a bored DAVIDSONIAN
Staff to represent the Q&C when—as is traditional
—the Q&C and “The Miscellany” both failed to
respond to the annual DAVIDSONIAN challenge. -
Robbie Hooker, editor of THE DAVIDSONIAN, .

Olson’s victory was the result of knocking
Hooker’s ball off the court five times. Hooker
never got past the third wicket.

R. D. “Aristotle” Anderson, also represent-
ing THE DAVIDSONIAN, lost his ball to Olson
only twice, but Olson almost knocked out four
Spectators as he hit Anderson’s ball into a densely
populated sunbathing area the first time.

STUDENTS EXAMINE CODE
Questionnaires Reveal Honor Violations

Second of Two Articles
By CHARLES McEWEN
Associate Editor

It's a short statement of policy,
succinct, clear and binding upon all
students.

Every student shall be honor bound
to refrain from cheating, stealing
and lying under oath. Every student
shall be honor bound to report im-
mediately all violations of the honor
system which come under his obser-
vation.

Such a statement of honor has no
purpose unless that statement is sup-
ported by all students. Some Davidson
Students don't.

In two separate questionnaires, at
least 38 students said that they had
violated the honor code here at least
once.

The total has only a relative signifi-
cance, however. Like all question-
naires, the results must be considered
in their relation to the sample. And
the effectiveness of the honor system
here must be judged relative to its
general effectiveness and in compari-"

son to other schools’ systems.

THE DAVIDSONIAN recently asked
27 students to fill out a questionnaire
on the honor system. Twenty-one stu-
dents completed the questionnaire and
returned it by mail to ensure anony-
mity. The students were asked merely
to circle the appropriate answers.

Nine seniors, seven juniors, seven
sophomores and four freshmen were
sent questionnaires. The sample in-
cluded representatives of each frater-
nity on campus and a 1:4 ratio of In-

down last January, but Trus

his -4-man trustee selection
committee would be shooting
for a decision by the May
meeting.

The. ROTE question. which

December. is likely to be on
the agenda. depending in part
on what the faculty did with
the matter this afternoon at
its special meeting.

If the CRAP report is ap
proved by the student body
and faculty next week, it will
also be on the agenda.

The trustees will meet in
their committees Thursday
night following an open din-
ner, then conduct a general
business session on Friday.

The board will wind up its
affairs Friday night with a
dinner honoring the retiring
Martin.

The recommendation
and the faculty's decis-
ion will not be available
for publication until after
next week’s trustee
meeting, according to

dependents to fraternity men,

Out of the 21 who responded, nine
students said that they had violated
the honor code at Davidson.

Eleven students knew of other
students who had violated the code.

Eleven students said that they
would turn in anothef student for an
honor code violation. Eight said they
would not. One student gave a tenta-
tive “no” answer, and one student
gave a tentative “yes” answer.

None of the 21 students had ever
reported an honor code violation.

A questionnaire of this type can
only reflect the viewpoints of a limit-
ed number of students. It can only
suggest trends of thought among stu-
dents; it cannot judge the relative
effectiveness of the honor system.

This questionnaire does not show
how many students have cheated, how
many have lied under oath or how
many have stolen or how many have
committed any combination of these
violations.

One student added a note to his
questionnaire: “This questionnaire is

ridiculous because the circumstances
are unknown. Strict yes and no an-
swers are not appropriate.”

Another student wrote that the “cir-
cumstances, seriousness, or provabili-
ty” would determine whether he
would report another. student's viola-
tion.

In another questionnaire, sent out
by the Honor Court, 40 students out of
146, about 25 per cent, said that they
had seen or suspected a violation of
the honor code and failed to report it.

By Wednesday, 161 students, mostly
upperclassmen and all members of a
fraternity, had answered at least part
of the Honor Court questionnaire.

The questionnaires were filled out
at the fraternity houses and collected
there. The remaining fraternities,
freshmen and Independents will also
be asked to fill out the questionnaires,
according to Bill Williams, Honor
Court chairman.

Only 29 students out of 146, or 18.1
per cent, said that they had committed
an honor offense at Davidson.
