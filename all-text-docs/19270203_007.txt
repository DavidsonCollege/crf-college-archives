war—and came to Hangchow on the last
train that went through from Shanghai.
The college, however, was most peace-

If you have followed the latest de-

ibegan an offensive against the Northern
armies, some time ago, and that so far)

have been exceptionally successful. They
have captured Hangkow and Kiukiang

SOPH PENNANTS

At a recent meeting of the Sophomore
class, the members decided to get pennants
and banners with class numerals on them, as
is the custom. The contract for supplying
the pennants and banners was given to the
“Student's Store.” The ‘pennants were or-
dered from the Beverly Manufacturing Com-
pany, of Staunton, Va.

The pennants are not made in the Sopho-
more colors, but are made in the red and
black of Davidson. The lettering is old Eng-
lish with nineteen above, and twenty-nine
below the word Davidson, The pennants are
said to be the best looking ever selected by
any class.

The banners are on-display at the Student’s
Store and all orders for same must be placed
with the managers of the store before Tues-

few outstanding facts,'day, February 8th.
