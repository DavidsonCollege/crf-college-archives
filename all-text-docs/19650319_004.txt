April 3, Davidson will send an
eight-man delegation to study
campus life at Amherst.

Those making up the Am-

herst delegation will be Steve
Murray, Andrew Rock, Andrew
Isserman, Ernest Chu, Bob
Woodreff, John Knoll, and
Charles Fierstine. Those chos-
en by the Student Council to
represent Davidson are: John
Barrow, Rick Brand, Danny
Boone. Charlie Dibble, Jay Fed-
erman, Tom Frist, David Pow-
ell, and Ted Pulliam. Heading
this group will be Tommy Heff-
ner, the co-ordinator for the pro-
gram at Davidson.

The purpose for which Am-
herst established this program,
according to Dean of Students
Richard C., Burts, was to “’re-
ceive insight into other institu-
tions’’ which would prove use-
ful to its administration.

One of the primary reasons
for Davidson's interest in the
program is the current frater-
sity controversy, which has al-
so begun at Amherst. Last
month a faculty subcommittee
at Amherst urged a sweeping
reorganization to make the coi-
lege. in the words of The New
York Times, ‘‘a genuine intel:
lectual community.”’ Itvrecom-
mended that the fraternities be
teplaced by a system of residen-
tial units, each of which would
be large enough to develop ‘‘a
full range of student activities.”

The exchange will be expense

The original estimated cost
of $20,000 had to be revised
when Air France cancelled its
contract for a charter jet leav-
ing from Charlotte. Due to the
late date, no other jet could
be chartered.

The alternative to the jet
from Charlotte is a group
plane which would leave from
New York City. However, such
8 group plan would raise the
tour’s cost by $6500.

The Chorus has the $20,000
on hand now; It raised $10,-
000 itself and the College has
given the other $10,000.

performances are_ scheduled
during the six-day trip, begin-
ning March 24, according to
Prof. Donald Plott, director of
the Music Department. Thirty-
four people will make the trip
by chartered bus.

The concerts will be given in
Wlison: Richmond, Va.; Silver

and twice in New York, one of
which will be at the Fifth Ave-
nue Presbyterian Church.

Two different types of pro-
grams will be presented on the
tour — sacred music at the
church appearances, and formal
concerts at the others. The for-
mal programs will consist of
sacred and secular music, in-
cluding selections by the Lamp-
lighters, led by Harry Causey.

The trip will be financed in
part by the Music Department's
budget and in part by receipts
from the performances, Plott
said.

host school providing room and

formal schedule will allow the
groups much freedom in visit-

ing classes and viewing campus
life. At Davidson, the visiting
delegation will be housed in the
dormitories, and individual stu-
dents will serve as hosts. The
visitors will eat at fraternity
houses and the College Union_

The program originated last
November in correspondence oe-
tween the Amherst co-ordinator
Louis Lustergarten and Presi-
dent D. Grier Martin. Martin
discussed the program in the

Committee, which turned the
program over to Student Coun-
cil.

Re- exam

Period
Scheduled

Re-examination period of the
first: semester will be held on
Saturday, March. 27.

Approximately 15 students
have applied through the dean
of students’ office for permis-
sion to take re-examinations.
Some are students who missed
the exams on regularly sched-
uled days and notified Dean of
Students Richard C. Burts of |
this.

Several of the students car |
tled a passing grade in a par
ticular course into the final ex-
am but failed the exam to such
an extent that they failed the!
course. These students receive |
an “R" grade in that course un-
til they take a re-exam.

If a student takes an exam’

again, he must pay a $2.50 fee
for each exam to the office of |
the dean of the faculty who ad-
ministers and regulates the ex-
aminations.

By HEYWARD CARTER
Davidsonian Feature Editor

The faculty and administrative members of the Fraternity Evaluation Commit.
{te were subjected to a rigorous two hours of questioning in Open End Wednesday

night,
Dr. John. O. Kelton and Rev,
Will Terry joined with Bob

.| Young and Bob Jones, jokingly

termed by moderator Paul
Simpson, as “Lords of the
Flies,’ opened the discussion
with preliminary statements,

Jones stated that he felt that
the fraternity system was based
on a system of exclusivism
which was detrimental to the
goals and aims of the college.
“The basic, fundamental issue
indicates that fraternities and
the colleges aspirations are ‘out
of joint’.”

Terry followed by pointing out
that in his mind the issue was
wwo-fold, the first point being
“discrimination, i.e., I do not
think that an organization
should eliminate a person from
membership before he comes to
college.” The second point is, |
“Rejection — the problem of
which is very acute.’’

Kelton, while saying that the
“basic problem is the domina-
tion of the campus by fraterni-
ties," added that .‘‘the imme-
diate recommendations are an!
attempt to take the focus away
from fraternities.”

The effect on fraternity mem-
bers themselves was pointed
out by Young who declared that
‘Intellectual life has a bad
name around here. Everything
else is play and there is a clear
division.”

After the discussion was
opened to the audience, Rufus
Hallmark perhaps expressed the
“majority opinion’ by  pro-
nouncing the desire that ‘‘stu-

outside of their fraternities and
look at and try to understand
their problems as we (the Fra-
ternity Evaluation Committee)
saw them.”

When asked what he consid-
ered to be the ‘“‘ideal system,”’
Dr. Kelton retorted that it would
probably be one, ‘‘not where the
blackball decides, but where a
majority vote or some sort of
preferential bidding, determines
the membership.”

However, he added, “I can't
see what is the ideal solution,
that is why I don’t want us to
put teeth in it (the Fraternity
Evaluation Committee Report)
at this point."

Terry was then asked what. he
thought was the bad effect of
fraternities on their members.

dents should be willing to step He replied, “I am not sure that

the fraternity system is respon-
sible for the degree of anti-in-
tellectualism that Bob Jones and
Bob Young are sure of. I feel
that the fraternity is sort of the
goat in this thing.’”’ As to the
system's effect on the non-mem-
ber he replied, "It, in many
cases, is very crushing, because
there are no social opportuni-
ties.”

After a delsate between Hall-
mark and Terry as to whether
the loyalty of the major portion
of alumni lies with the school or
fraternities, Dr, Kelton crypti-
cally answered a question as to
the proposed location of the eat-
ing clubs by saying “‘When the
fall of 1966 comes there may be
two or three empty houses down
there which would make lovely
eating clubs.”

Union’s ‘Spring Fling’
Will Feature Movies

The College Union has planned a line-up of re-
freshments and movie entertainment for March 26,
the last night before spring break. This year’s
“Spring Fling”, will feature such films as: The List
of Adrian Messenger (intrigue), The Brides of Drac-.
ula (horror), North by Northwest (suspense). The
Ugly American (documentary). The Lady Killers
(comedy), and Backstreet (drama).

Starting at 5 p.m., the movies will be shown free
of charge in the Morrison Room, the Wildcat Room,
and, if weather permits, out-of-doors. All of the
movies will be shown at each place at sometime dur-

ing the evening.

During the night and early morning, free snacks
will be provided. Breakfast will even be served at

the close of the party.

The play was presented in
New York With great success in
the late fifties. The cast con-

man of indeterminable age; the
housekeeper, a talkative woman
