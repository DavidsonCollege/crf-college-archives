college program. It's a

tradition.

training people to
doa job that’s also
a tradition. The
job of an Army
officer.
F 3hg In 1819,
Re Captain Alden
- Partridge, a former
"superintendent at
* West Point, started
what w we now today as Army ROTC.

He felt our country needed more “citizen sol-
diers.” So he established the first private school to
offer military instruction.

It didn't take long for his idea to spread. ,

By the turn of the century. 105 colleges
and universities across the country were offering
military instruction on their campuses.

Today, with Army ROTC available at over

* 1,400 colleges and universities,ghe program is
stronger than ever. -

ARMY ROTC.

TO BE ANE OFFICE
IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST.

And last year alone, over 70,000 students

participated.
me were interested in the leadership

and management training. Others enrolled on
full-tuition scholarships. And the financial
assistance — up to’$1,000 a year during the last
two years of ROTC — attracted still others.

But all of them had one thing in common:
the desire to begin their future as Army officers.

Why don't you do the same? Youll

aduate to a position of real responsibility.

Exercise leadership and management skills.
Build a secure future for yourself. And enjoy the
travel, adventure and prestige
of being a second lieuten-
ant in today’s Army.
