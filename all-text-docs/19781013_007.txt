College Bo wi recounts glory and gears up

By J W ARETINO

A whistle blows, a “toss-up”
occurs, a buzzer sounds. Bas-
ketball is not the center of at-
tention; rather four sharp
southern gentlemen, bespeckled
and groomed, match wits and
speed in a battle of the cere-
brum. College bowl is hopefully
back to stay.

1969 was a year most people
associate with a phenomenal
basketball team, but another
team at Davidson set a high
standard. Interest in a College’
Bowl team was strong with over
eighty people competing for a
place on a four member team.

Under the sharp, witty and
patient master, English Profes.
sor Charles E. Lioyd, the ranks
were thinned to a team of four
and one alternate. Each mem-
ber of that team is a story unto
himself.

Richard D. Anderson, nick-
named ‘‘Aristotle’’ by class-
mates, was a sophomore inte-
rested in German. After gradu-
ation he sought a career in the
diplomatic service. Today he
holds a position with the De-
partment of State.

Robert Bryan was chosen
captain of the team with good
reason. Bryan's lightening an-
swers and “school boy”’ enthu-
siasm elicited fan mail and
even various proposals. Origi-
nally interested in law school,
Bryan is on the verge of comple-
ting his doctorate in medieval
history, a major that seems to
have served him well at David-
son.

’ Samuel Gwynn was the third

member of the team. He was .

once a member of the football
team and a very talented poet
having won the college’s Vereen
Bell award for creative writing
and having several poems pub-
lished. Today Sam Gwynn is
teaching at the University of
Arkansas, a dream and goal he
nurtured while in school here.

» Charles Timmons was the
fourth member of the team. He
was a pre-medical major recrui-:
ted for his scientific knowledge
and interest in mythology. He
probably also rendered first-aid

Professor Lloyd fondly recalls
the work, tension, travel, -anec-
dotes, and fun the team had.
“It was perhaps one of the most
enjoyable experiences I’ve ever
had,” Lloyd commented.

The team flew to New York

four times for their matches.

According to Lloyd this was an
important incentive for stu-
dents to try out. for the team.

Davidson fared very well ‘in

team in the 10 year history of

the College Bowl, amassing one +

of the highest point totals in one
game ever, and bringing home
nearly $20,000 in scholarship
money.
