Duke Religion Students
—Made Future Chaplains

“Chaplains of Veterans of Future Wars” Organized at N. C.
University; Platform Includes Pep Talks, Sermons,
Funeral Orations, Memorial Days

“The Chaplains of the Veterans of Future Wars” was or-
ganized recently among a group of-stadents of the school of
Keligion at Duke University, to serve the Veterans of Future

Wars, an organization started at Princeton University. —
In a wire sent to the Princeton headquarters of the national
organization, the Duke organization applied for a charter and

offered their services to the V.

The following platform was of-
fered for the new organization:

1. To make pep talks to the Vet-
crans of Future Wars in order that
it may not take them so long to
realize the “truth” that they are
doing “God's work" while murder-
ing the enemy.

2. Yo preach sermons to the Vet-
erans of Future Wars, so that their
ideals may- never fall below those
of Christ, as they blast, boom, and
bayonet their Christian foes.

3. ‘To start preaching funeral ora
tiohs now so that those who, in
spite of divine providence, are dis-
membered by crucl enemies may
hear of the “Christ-like service”
they will have rendered. In this
way it will be possible to give indi-
—vidualorations pon the virtues of
dying for one’s country, even upon
foreign soil. This is m preférence
to being one of the wholesale lot

. 4
that is dumped and covered over’

with only the phrase “poor devils”
as oration and epitaph,

4. To institute, semi-annual me-
morial days for the Unknown Sol-
dier, in which all Veterans of lu-
ture Wars will participate. Then
_each may dream that he may be
the one of whom suth noble words
are spoken and to whom such rev-
erence is given. Attempt will be
made to secure a national politiican
to speak. In this way, the Veter-
ans of Future Wars may fearn of
the. contribution to the progress af
civilization that is made by tte
youth who give their tives for “the
cause” while the “statesmen” at
home give their very life's blood
sitting in-swivel chairs and com-
plaining of the noise in the streets
caused by unprecedented business.

_W. J. Muneycutt)§ was elected
Chaplain-in-Chicf at the meeting
and Charles S. Jarvis was elected
secrelary. An intensive campaign

_ for_the enlistment of _imembers will
begin immediately. Suggestions for
prayers and hymns to aid in carry-
ing out the organization's platform
were to be made at the next meet-
ing. —Duke Chronicle.

Pessimism Is Shown
By Columbia Seniors

PESSIMISM 1S SHOWN __ LL.
New Yorki— (ACP) —Columbia
University seniors placed a lower.
estimate on their salaries five years
after graduation than any other
class during the last fifteen years.
They expected that in 1941 they
will have an average salary of $2,-
$35, compared with $3,000 for last
year's class and $5,102 for the class
of 1934. Only three expect $10,000
in five years. -
* This would indicate, according to
those who conducted the poll, that
the continuance of the business
slump has lowered the confidence of
students in their future.

Cadet members of the local
R. O. T: C. unit are thinking
seriously of writing Uncle Sam
and asking him to please re-
frain from geting mixgd up
in anothér war.

The conclusion was reached Mon-
day afternoon following the usual
drill on the golf course watching
advanced students and officers fire
away at imaginary cnemies. They
have decided that war ts all too
bloody an affair for them to be
mixed up in.

After the recent scare given Uncle
Sam by the Future Veterans he will
ho doubt de glad to hear that oth-
er. studemts do not feel thar they
should be given the privilege of
spending their bonus before it. is
too late to do-them any good. He
might even put them on relief for

This decision will no dovbt cansc

The Philanthropic Viterary

_The program for the meeting was
in the form of a debate. The sub-
ject of the debate was Resolved:
That the United States Should Con-

The attiriiuive was upheld by

were Kichard UW, Lindsey and Dav

Hatkey based the argument of

that society has the tight to take
uoman’s life; that society is at times
obliged to take a man’s fife: and
that society is at times benc/ited
by taking a manis lite,

Templeton devoted his time ta
refuting the arguments promoted
by the negative. ,

The negative based their argu-

Well sir, ] am in the “College,”

WHAT THE CO-EDS

THINK OF COLLEGE MEN

(By Associated Collegiate Press)
Chapel Hill, N. C—Ben Neville,

enterprising student at the. Univer-_

sitY of North Carolina here recently
set out to discover just what col-
lege women think wf college men.
He found out, too:

“College «men are the most selfish
and egotistical creatures on earth!”
screamed the questioned co-eds.
“They get drunk too much, they
lack. respect for girls and older-
people, they have no sense of re-
sponsibility for their social obliga-
tions.”

Their table manners are “lousy”
and they try to brag about their
dates to fraternity brothers. They
are rude, insincere, disrespectful, in-
considerate, impolite, discourteous.
. From the University of Indiana
comes the opinion that “the most
common failing of college boys oc-
curs in fraternity houses after dates.
There each boy openly and rudely
classifies each girl. Sometimes a
girl doesn’t have a chance to live

down a reputation after a boy has
branded her.” '

During the week-end of April
24 and 25, Dr. J..M. Douglas at-
tended the mecting of the Academy
of Science which was held at Duke
University. :

On the first day the Aéademy dis-

-eussed problems in. Physics and_Bi-

ology. On the second day, the dif-
ferent departments of the Academy
Were divided aud each held sep-
arate meetmgs. “ The physics group
of which Dr. Douglas was a mene
ber, discussed such subject as:
thermonic tubes; NX rays; the fric-
tion of falling bodies: and many
other topics brought up as the re-
sults of research. At the_ joint
mecting on Friday, Dr. Porter, the
retiring president, delivered an ex-
cellent. talk on Louis Agassiz;—

part of the group under its con-
trol; however, there are hundreds
