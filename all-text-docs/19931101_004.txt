NFL votes to give Charlotte and the Carolinas the Panthers

By Robert Lloyd-Still

The wait is over. On Wednesday, the
NFL owners granted Charlotte an NFL ex-
pansion team. The otherremaining spot will
be announced November 30: St. Louis,
Jacksonville, Memphis, and Baltimore are
still in the running.

“This is a dream come true forme,” said
Jerry Richardson, the owner of the Carolina
Panthers. “Especially adream come true for
ten million people back in the Carolinas.”

The NFL was attracted to Charlotte for
a number of reasons. They included the
success of the NBA Charlotte Hornets, the

geographical location, and the solidity of
the ownership group.

The football team will play their first
season in 1995 at Clemson University in
South Carolina. In 1996, the Panthers will
play in the stadium being built in downtown
Charlotte.

The social and economic ramifications
of this decision are enormous. Charlotte and
Davidson College will be affected in innu-
merable ways.

Charlotte will receive more interna-
tional recognition, This will result in more
companies moving to Charlotte. As Char-

lotte grows, Davidson will feel the positive
effects of the NFL’s newest expansion team.

Richardson wants to find a head coach
with NFL coaching experience. The pos-
sible candidates are former Redskin’s coach
Joe Gibbs, former Bear’s coach Mike Ditka,
and former Patriot’s coach Raymond Berry.

This expansion group has been work-
ing on the project for six years. Richardson,
chairman and CEO of Flagstar Companies,
which own Denny’s and Hardee’s restau-
rants, paid $140 million dollars for the Pan-
thers to join the league.

The Panther’s colors will be black, sil-

ver and blue. While the team will not open
until 1995, Panther-mania has already hit
the Carolinas in full force.

~The Road to Davidson

Faculty concerned about Code

Excitement is
beginning to build
in anticipation of

the Final Four.

By Wendy Lee

“The Road To Davidson.”
That’s the name of a weekly televi-
sion show that highlights college
soccer nationally.

The eyes of soccer fans all
over the country Will turn to
Davidson College December 3 and
5 as it hosts the NCAA Division I
Men’s Soccer Championship for
the second consecutive year on
Richardson Field.

' The number of tickets avail-
able has been increased from 8,100
last year to over 10,400 this year.
The increase is possible because

this year, large bleachers will be
placed in the end zones as well as

on the sides of the stadium.

For the second straight year,
Davidson will surpass the 2-day
attendance record for an NCAA
Soccer Tournament.

Yearly the NCAA sponsors
89 National Championships. The
soccer tournament at Davidson is
one of only five that sells out each
year.

Tickets went on sale June 1,
and over 8,000 were sold that first
day alone. By July 30 the more
than 10,400-tickets had been sold.

John Beyer of the Athletic

Ticket Office noted that “We will
be able toaccommodate afew lucky
people on the waiting list, but any-
one else looking for tickets better
Start working ona plan to be onthe
roof of the library.”

Beyer also said that a strong
effort was made this year to get
tickets to any student who wanted
them.

Every student was mailed a
ticket application prior to June 1.
Beyer feels that “every Davidson
student who wanted tickets got
them.”

In addition to Beyer, a host of
people from the Athletic Depart-
ment are working hard to make the
tournament a success.

Lee Sargent is Tournament Di-
rector and Pat Millen is respon-
sible for marketing and promo-
tions. Emil Parker will assist mem-
bers of the press who will be
present.

One of the greatest challenges
during the tournament will be park-
ing for over 10,000 fans.

As was done last year, the
empty lot by I-77 and the Exxon
station will be used for parking. A
shuttle service will transport fans
to the Village Green.

During the games, Pizza Hut,
Wendy’s, and the Lion’s Club will
have food booths. The Village
Green will also provide food as
well as entertainment for fans.

Millen noted that for the first
time ever, both the semifinals and

championship _game-will be tele-.

vised live on the Prime Network—

Sport South.. Over 200 members
of the pgess are expected.

Spectator Sports Network in
Charlotte has exclusive rights to
the selling of tournament souve-
nirs and merchandise. Fans can
purchase t-shirts and parapherna-
lia on the Village Green and in the
stadium.

Beyer said that the NCAA has
asked Davidson to enforce a “no
exit policy” once people have en-
tered the stadium.

For this reason, phones will
be set up inside the stadium to
assist with the problem.

Honor continued from page 1

Council Chairman to meet with
the faculty; it is, in fact, a regular
event.

In addition to the faculty's
concerns about the Code's effec-
tiveness, Davis will also address
issues ranging from the trial pro-
cess to the obligations of the teach-
ers.

The faculty concerns, how-
ever, will be the primary issue.
Says Davis, "We know that at least
one member of the faculty is very
vocal in their opposition to the

honor process as it stands."

He added, however, that the
faculty complains about every
other year. He says Dean Terry
told him that several years ago the
faculty complained that the Code
was not working because there
were too many convictions.

"The very next year a differ-
ent group complained that there
were too few. It is just how it
goes."
Nonetheless, the meeting is
an important one, and Davis
pointed out that this year's round of
complaints seem to be serious.

In her address, Cole chal-
lenged heraudience, and especially
the members of the Class of 1994,
to prepare themselves to pull the
weight of the new world. She
encouraged future leaders to “draw
onthe talents, sensitivities, and the
plain old smarts of all of our
people,” including women and
people of color, in order torespond
appropriately to our rapidly chang-
ingworld. —

Cole cited instances in which
women and minorities are “un-
educated and mis-educated” in
school, suppressing their talents
and abilities, “To teach of the
world’s heroes, and not the world’s
she-roes is to tell only a part of the
world’s moving action,” she
claimed. Cole called for multi-
cultural education, in which we
“respect the rainbow of human-

- ity,” not by giving up academic
-excellence, but by coupling it with

way to make contacts which will
