THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, APRIL 12, 1963

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

A Statement Of Purpose

This issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN
is the first put out by the new staff
for 1963-64. Therefore it seems im-

ortant that a statement of purpose
e recorded here, not only to give
students and subscribers some idea of
what we intend to accomplish, but to
establish some guide-lines for our-
selves.

Conversations with adult sub-
scribers and students recently have
made one thing clearer than ever:
THE DAVIDSONIAN. in order to even
partially appeal to its entire circula-
tion, is going to have to find some mid-
dle road. through schizophrenia. Most
of the large number of subscribing
alumni and parents expect an objec-
tive look at Davidson, with emphasis
on the positive aspects of college life.
Students here, however, apparently
expect a harder and more cynical
tone, emphasizing the exposal of
flaws in the Davidson College system.

Unfortunately, that middle road
is painfully hard to determine. Grant-
ed that an important function of any
newspaper is recognizing problems
and attempting to have them correct-
ed. But an equally important respon-
sibility involves looking for, encourag-
ing, and praising improvement.
latter function is neglected all too
often as problems are emphasized and
improvements are ignored, so the edi-
torial below is a first step in the op-
posite direction.

The main thing this newspaper
needs right now is a change of atti-
tude, as simple as that may sound,
and the reason is as follows. When
THE DAVIDSONIAN serves merely to
reflect a complaining, cynical attitude
by ceaselessly attacking different as-
pects of college life. students become
accustomed to the idea that “every-
thing is all messed-up around here.”
and their already unhealthy attitude
is only reinforced and complicated.

Therefore, it seems that if this
new staff were to make a conscious
effort to focus student attention at
least partly on something outside the
perennial drinking and vespers prob-
lems, student interest could be raised
in other areas, whereas it is mostly
nil now on the traditional issues.

One such attempt to reorient
student attention will come out next
week in the form of a two-page Spring
Frolics insert. If the insert proves suc-
cessful, we hope to continue it next
year. Bill Hagen has been working for
some time on the idea of a semi-
monthly or monthly six-page news-
paper, and the Publications Board has
now submitted the request to the
faculty and trustees for their approval.

If allowed, a six-page paper would
permit not only fuller news coverage
and more pictures and picture fea-
tures, but an expansion of the sports
page to give better coverage to areas

such as IMAC competition. An insert
page would also allow for a student
and local classified ad column,
features from creative writing classes,
short summaries of important events
on other campuses, more student
columns, book and movie reviews, and
student opinion polls, which would

ermit us to speak if not for, then at
Teast accurately about, a concensus of
student opinion.

The extra space could also be
used for better coverage of area cul-
tural events, faculty members, frater-
nities, honors and deans lists, and
community features. Despite the fact
that Davidson has a strong pre-medical
program, very little is ever written by
the science professors, and even less
is written about the science program
here. Also, every year several polls
are made by psychology majors on all
manner of subjects, but the final re-
sults are never printed. Features writ-
ten from the conclusions of these polls
could reveal much about the attitude
of Davidson students.

Another possibility provided by a
six-page newspaper would be a calen-
dar of events at the numerous colleges
in this area, as Davidson College is
virtually a “suitcase campus” anyway.
THE DAVIDSONIAN gets a pile of
announcements from various schools
every day besides exchange copies of
their newspapers, but has no way of
passing on such information.

Bitter and destructive criticism
has no place in any kind of publica-
tion. Useless criticism also could be
done without. For instance, take the
drinking rule as it now stands. Several
pages could be written attacking the
rule for its ambiguity, and. freely
granted, much of the criticism would
be accurate and factually justifiable.
But such efforts would be about as
constructive as Sisyphus’ rock-pushing
experiences. The college is simply
caught between that same rock and
the proverbial hard place: move one
way and be confronted with solid op-
position from trustees and alumni, or
move the other way and face open
student rebellion. What do you do?
Exactly what they’ve done, which
would indicate that it is high time out-
spoken groups of both alumni and
students realized that this college has
problems of its own.

Finally, this newspaper has com-
plete editorial freedom, and serves as
the only printed outlet of student
opinion at Davidson. That adds up to
make responsible journalism a must,
and responsible journalism is exactly
what we intend to attain. It won't
come overnight, mainly because we
are what we are—college student;
with several more problems than solu-
tions. But given time it will come, and
in the meantime, any constructive
criticism of our work by readers will
be welcome.

A New Responsibility

The news of recent weeks has
been studded with accounts of censor-
ship, news management and other
beaurocratic controls. Of course the
natural counterpoint to these old
tunes is responsibility.

Earlier this week one of David-
son’s traditional controls was revised
to allow a new freedom and certainly
greater responsibility on the pat of
the student .. . We refer to the new
decision of the faculty to allow great-
er latitude in vespers attendance.

The thesis of the new plan is that
students will be permitted to attend
Sunday morning service in any church

in the town of Davidson and pledge
this attendance in place of the college-
sponsored evening vesper services.

The personal responsibility of the
individual student in such a system is
immediately evident. Such a pledge
will be as much a part of the Honor
System as pledged classwork and tests.

This new freedom is the product
of open minds, which believe that such
a proposal is in the best interests of a
conscientious student body. It took a
certain amount of trust for the faculty
to agree to such a proposal, and it will
be the responsibility of the students
not to take advantage of this freedom.

Pahud Gives Insights Valiant ADA Rhetoric
On Swiss Democracy fails To Harvest Converts

BY JEAN-JACQUES PAHUD
Richardson Scholar

Born in the thirteenth cen-
tury, grounded on a_ strong
popular freedom, Switzerland
presents the typical features of
a true democracy. Let's over-
look here the concept of neu-
trality which is a very ticklish
question and which isn't subject
to a plain definition.

Switzerland is built on the
life of her parts: the cantons.
They are sovereign as long as
their rights are not limited by
the constitution. Therefore
Swiss cantons are not simple
administrative districts; they
can not be compared to the
French departments, for exam-
ple. Like the states of this coun-
try, they possess their own con-
stitution, their legislative and
executive power.

The Federal Assembly, the
legislative authority, represents
the people and the cantons. It
is formed after the image of the
American pattern (Congress)
with two chambers: the Nation-
al Council, the equivalent of the
American House of Representa-
tives, representing the people
and the States Council which is
similar to your Senate, repre-
senting the cantons. The depu-
ties of the two councils vote
without instructions; for exam-
ple, the members of the States
Council do not receive any man:
date of their. cantons.

However. the problem of the
executive power was solved in
a quite different way than it
was In your country; the colleg-
ial regime replaces your presi-
dential system. The nomination
of the Federal Council (execu-
tive power) is a typical Swiss
institution. The Federal Council
is elected every fourth year by
the Federal Assembly (both
chambers together). It is com-
posed of seven members and
assumes the duties of the chief
of the state.

Its members are chosen a-
mong all Swiss citizens; but sev-
eral subjects from the same
canton can not ‘be elected. In
fact this election considers the
various parts of the country, the
different languages, religions,

and political tendances. Stability
is one of the characteristics of
the Swiss government: federal
councellors are generally. re-
elected. —

The annual election of the
president of the Confederation
is @ pure formality. The vice
president in charge is always
appointed as president and his
successor is designated in o
rotation established by the
convention. In reality the
president of the Confederation
is president of the Federal
Council. He has no specific
charges but some obligetions
of representation outside.

A very typical Swiss feature
is the lack of a true capital.
Bern is certainly the federal
town as the seat of the federal
administration; but it is not the
country’s center: federalist
forces are set against each other.
It remains the capital of the
important canton of Bern but
it is not a Swiss Washington
(with its own territory).

In the field of languages
Switzerland is in full contrast
with the characteristics gener-
ally. attributed to a nation. Dur-

Dear Editor:

There’s a hole in the road
about 20 yards west of Richard-
son dorm that is at least two
yards wide and five inches deep.
It is extremely hard on car tires
arid my teeth.

If somebody doesn't fix it
they're going to be pretty sorry.

To whom it may concern:

Davidson has nothing but a
bunch of good-for-nothing, neg-
lecting letter writers.

It would seem that during a
week free from academic re-
sponsibility, time could be found
to drop a ndte of “sweet noth-
ings” into the mail.

Just you all wait til our vaca-
tion comes up!

“Gentlemen?”

ing the 19th century countries
were founded especially on a
similarity of languages and
races. Switzerland, where sev-
eral languages are spoken did
not yield to this movement, at-
testing in this way that neither
the tongue nor the race is the
constitutive element of a nation.

Whatever his native language

may be, the Swiss is always a ~

Swiss but never a German, a
Frenchman, or an Italian. This
Swiss Character is, at the same
time is a tie which links to-
gether three great European
civilizations, in order to make
an harmonious co-existence and
co-operation of three different
valuable cultures.

Four different languages for
so small a country (17,000
square miles or 0.5% of the
continental U.S.) is an amazing
fact. So they enjoy absolutely
equivalent rights and they are
without restrictions by the
authorities of their own cantons.
So in the Federal Assembly, for
instance, speeches are pronounc-
ed in German, Italian and
French. Let us consider the re-
spective importance of each of
them: 3,500,000 inhabitants
speak German, 1,000,000 French,
300,000 Italian, and 50,000 Ro-
manche. People speaking Ro-
manche nave generaily a second
language, German.)

A linguistic particularity of
Switzerland is the dialect
spoken in the German part.
The Swiss-German patois has
@ national importence, and so
it is spoken as the usual lan-
guege in every sense. The
numerous dialects which dif-
fer from canton to canton are
the native language of their
inhabitants, when literary
German is learned and spoken
in schools, ceremonies, and
Church services only. But in
the French-speaking Switzer-
land patois belongs to the
pest, being more and more
supplanted by the literary
tongue.

These are the singularities of
a single people among the in-
numerable singularities of our
modern world.

Engle's Search For Form
Brings Him To Festival

BY BOB ADAMS
Daridesctine Farture Viriter
Love of art is the force that

motivates this man. Talk to
Frank Engle, associate professor
of art ot the University of Ala-
bama, and he'll discuss with you
the furcetion of the artist in. so-
ciety; contemporary trends such
as “abstract expressionism,” and
certainly the problems in his
own work.

Speaking on the function of
the art:st, Engle explained that
the true artist does not work to
satisfy the present public tate
but works toward “final form”
much as the philosopher search-
es for truth.

He is less concerned with the
knowledge that his work is
meaningless to some than with
the occassional accusation that
his work resembles that of an-
other artist. Although artists are

influenced somewhat by others,
he savs. “Artists are connected.”

In discussing his own work
Engle says “1 work rapidly in a
very short time . . . combining
the emotional and intellectual
approach to the subject.” Like
other artists, he suffers mentl-
ly and physically at some stages
of his work. He admits to being
absent-minded and disorganized
about some matters.

In all ‘his projects he is con-
cerned with space and space
forms. Sculpture and ceramics
help him achieve the form he
wants and also add variety to
his work.

When asked what he theught
about the evelution ef future
art trends, what he thought
would replece expressionism, |
cubism, and realism, Bngle
simply replied “something
new.” He will undoubtedly be

State University Asks
‘Will U.S. Aid Come?’

Editor’s Note: Reprinted from
the Wisconsin Daily Cardinal.

Sooner or later American col-
leges and universities will be
receiving direct federal aid. The
only question is whether this
will be supplied in time to pre-
vent a staggering blow to our
educational system.

The states, whose legislators
so often condemn “big gov-
ernment,” heave been notor-
iously lax in providing for the
educational needs of their
citizens. Our problem in Wis-
consin is mirrored in almost
every state whose public in-
stitutions depend largely on
state funds for support.

On our own campus, enroll-
ment is soaring upward; more
than 30,000 are expected on the
Madison campus by the end of
the ‘decade. More teachers and
buildings are needed; further,
higher faculty salaries are ur-
gently needed to raise the Uni-
versity out of its state as one of
the lowest paying schools in its
field.

Where is this money to come
from? Private sources already
account for more than half of
the University's revenue. Feder-
al research grants now provide

the heart of the University’s
money for vitally needed basic
and applied research. The state,
whose funds are essential to the
school, has again shown its
traditional unwillingness to
shoulder the increasing burden
of educating its citizens for lead-
ership and knowledge.

These sources will grow; but
it is evident that they will not
grow fast enough to keep pace
with the increase in the de-
mands made on the University.
And the same is true of public
higher education throughout our
land.

The Federal Government is
already aiding colleges
through research and study
grants. But more action is
desperately needed. It is sure-
ly not “paternalistic” or
“socialistic” to provide for the
education of the young, on
whatever level. An educated
citizenry hes today become @
vital national resource, and
one thet must be preserved
and cultivated. With the pres-
ent financial predicament of
public higher education, fed-
eral aid is a necessity If this
natural resource is not to lie
talfow.

@ contributor to the new
trend, for he isn’t satistied
with his old work. “After e
show | find something else to
tery.”

The artist's expression is con-
stantly changing, just as the
economic and political condi-
tions of life fluctuate. As Frank
Engle stated, “Art and life can't
be separated.” The meaning in a
work of art varies for each in-
dividual observing it. Sometimes
the artist's “search for final
form” and the layman's capacity
for aesthetic appreciation com-
bine, and pleasure, the object
of art, is realized.

Engle’s contribution to the
Davidson Fine Arts Festival is
presented in a variety of media.
His work will be art to some
observers and meaningless,
chaotic shapes to others. It
would be wel] worth a student's
time, however, to browse
through the Engle collection in
the Fine Arts Center. In spite
of himself, he might ‘receive a
more liberal education.

According to Frank Engle, as-
sociate professor of art at the
University of Alabama, art is a
matter of individual taste: a
painting or sculpture is not a
work of art unless it is pleasing
to the observer. For the layman,
art is shapes and masses ar-
ranged to please, and for the
artist, it is the “search for final
form.”

A casual stroll through the
corridors of the Fine Arts Cen-
ter will quickly reveal that
someone has been searching for
that final form. When the stud-
ent ventures inside the massive
white door, his gaze is immed-
iately arrested by the baleful
stare of what appears to be a
cyclopean eye fixed in a sea of
darkness appropriately entitled
“Sepia Galaxy.”

Recovering from his initial
reaction and dering to inves-
tigate further, he next ob-
serves the chartreuse and red
hues of “Summer Light’ at
the left end of the corridor.

In a small gallery off the main
corridor, the artist has inter-

spersed steel and copper sculp-

ture among his paintings.

“Torch Bloom,” “Inception,” and
ere titles
which only vaguely intimate the
intrepid form of his sculpture.

“Spero Meliora”

BY RICK VON UNWERTH
Davidsonian Assistant Editor

“We are an organization of progressives!”

A bold statement—and the call-to-arms for an even
bolder program. Arthur Gorsen, National Chairman of the
Campus Division—Americans for Democratic Action
(CADA,) outlines his organization’s commitment in the
latest issue of the CADA “Bulletin.”

Copies are available in the Union—behind the door
to the Morrison Room.

“We are quite sure that we are for full civil rights,”
says Gorson, ‘But how can we ever hope to have equality
until the socio-economic inequalities in our society are
changed.”

A diagnosis of America’s socio-economic maladies ap-
pears to be the consuming interest of ADA's college-
crowd crusaders.

“Feudalistic power structure,” “the cultivation
of poverty,” and a “reactionary Congress” are the
culprits to which these torchbearers of young liberal-
ism assign the responsibility for our shortcomings.

The case against the Congress and other social male-
factors was presented in chapel Monday by Gorson in the
flesh, outriding for the ADA in the South. Skirting the
more “emotional” areas, Gorson‘strewed a handful of
seeds from his utopian grab-bag at the students’ feet. The
majority of the liberals’ ideas did not, perhaps unfortun-
ately, find their fullest expression at the hands of the
speaker.

Among the commitments of Campus ADA is a
noble dedication to the “elimination of poverty.” Their
statement of principles, according to Gorson, includes
the espousal of “economic security for all.” Chairman
Gorson advocates “new and radicle (sic) ways to dealing
with” the problem of poverty.

Generalizations are dangerous. However, to radicals
and radicalism might generally be ascribed an innocent
predilection to oversimplify.

“Poverty in the United States,” pronounces a
“Bulletin” feature, could be eliminated, given one
condition—that its continued existence shamed us
and so angered us that we would be willing to sup-
port measures which, to be meaningful, would hurt
the rich and powerful to the benefit of those who are
neither. Given this sole condition poverty in America
can be totally eliminated... .“

The Sherwood Forest economy was somewhat less
complex than America’s.

. The Americans for Democratic Action are purport-
edly concerned primarily with “raising the questions” of
civil liberty, social reforms, and the like. Many of the
issues need to be called before—and kept before—the
American people and their government representatives.

In many instances, however, a penchant for
drama and a passion for rapid, high-powered reform
leads spirited idealism to overshoot the mark. The
U.S. government is not geared for county-down leg-
islation. Perhaps Gorson’s “radical reactionary con-
gressmen” provide the stability so necessary in keep-
ing the ship of state on course.

Conservatively oriented Davidson rejected Gorson’s
argument; the student body blithely smothered the germs
he attempted to infect it with. He and his coleagues were
attacked with surprisingly outspoken (and at times em-
barrassing) conviction in informal discussion.

In this respect at least his brave sally merits applaus.
Whether Davidson agreed with him or not, Gorson at
least tricked some of the students into thinking for an
