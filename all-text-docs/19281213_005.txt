HELP

GET THOSE BAND UNIFORMS

CAT TRAX

As They Follow the Red and
Black

By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

+.

Well, it is all over now, except the
usual squabble over mythical teams.
Those picks are representative rather
than complete, for there are inevitably
any number of excellent men who
must be left off. It’s hard enough to
choose an all-state, but think of the
material in selecting your all-southern
eleven. Don’t feel bad if your pet star
doesn’t get first pick—usually it is just
a case of a toss-up as to which is the
better man.

The “old army game” seems to
work pretty well out around Ten-
nessee way. Any team that drops
only one game in three years of stiff

1s wal cal has athi: h td.
luck, and we suspect that the Vol-
unteers have a system all of their
own. Florida, however, must have
had her share of bad breaks in the
classic which Bob Neyland’s boys
copped. It’s tough to drop any
game by the points after ,touch-
down, and it is funny how these
fellows always miss ’em at critical
times.

Jan Jankoskie, Duke’s big “little
man,” certainly ripped that Tar Heel
line to pieces Saturday. Four or five
yards a clip is what the Milwaukee
brewer was stepping off, and the big
men in Collin’s line just couldn’t put
the brakes on his antics, To make the
general discomfiture worse Buie and
Bill Murray ran like demons any
time they felt like it. We think that
Davidson's little red line held the Blue
Devils infinitely better than did the
Tar Heels in that first half.

But when the Heels got started
on the grand final it was only a
matter of minutes. They trotted
out six or seven of their backfield
aces and began to run every way
but up. This Erickson is one fast
streak, and the way Jim Wagner
smashed the Duke line was a ter-
rible sight. House and Ward did
their part to perfection also. It’s
a shame to see all those good back
sitting on Mr. Collin’s bench when
some of these other teams have
trouble putting even four steady
men on the field. 3

Next year is going to see a renovated
Wildcat team. Of that we are sure.
The backfield will be stronger by. a
good.deal, and if Tex Tilson can build
a line that played as this season’s line
did out of the material he had, then we
say that he can do as well next year in
spite of the dearth of letter men avail-
able. Brock and David are going to go
mighty good on the flanks, and Bill
Mason is going to give any center
around here all he can handle.

We understand that the Univer-
sity of Virginia is negotiating for
the opening game next fall. How
would it be to play Virginia, Clem-
son, and Army in a row? Frankly,
we don’t know. At any rate it
would give Davidson the most
completely difficult schedule of
games that a small school around
these parts has ever undertaken.
Hampden-Sidney used to start with
Virginia every year, but they didn’t
have the forces of “Red” Cagle in
the offing.

The physical culture class conducted
by Captain Pritchett is undoubtedly
one of the best innovations ever
brought to Davidson. It will build
men if adhered to rigidly, and the way
the students are starting out, it seems
to be certain that a large number will
be out when the spring period closes.
Pritchett is filling a need long felt at
Davidson, and he is doing his work in
a way that commands thorough co-
operation. Back him up to the limit.

Cage activities are gaining mo-
mentum daily, and it won’t be so
long till the varsity and freshmen
quints will strut their wares before
the student body. Not so much is
known about the yearlings, but
Tilson is whipping a formidable
five into shape, and has several
men that look good for future var-
sities. Hope we get to see the
teams in action before the holi-
days. That would give some idea
of what to expect after Christmas.
We have a hunch that Monk's

seem to be up to standard for Caro-

Davidson contributes Thad Brock as
left end and Odell Sapp walks off with
the other flank. Brock was the hard-
est working player in the state this
year. He kicked, passed, and played
one whale of a game on defense. He
is light, but we. believe he is as de-
serving of a berth as any of the oth-
ers. Brock is going to be a real lumi-
nary in another year. Sapp’s ability
as a pass receiver and his long expe-
rience entitle him to the other end.

Buie runs, kicks, or passes with the
best of them, and to top it all is a fine

hardest places to fill, because there are
a dozen fine prospects. We side with
Murray and Magner, but pay high
tribute to Kell, Davidson’s flash, Tom
Nash, of Collin’s brigade, Tex Quillen,
of Wake Forest, Melton, of State, Hol-
lingsworth, Duke, and Ward, Carolina.
Bob Warren has proved to be such
a tower of strength in every way to
the N. C. State Wolfpack that we can
not very well do him out of the full-
back prize. Warren is one of the
hardest men to stop that the state has
ever seen, and he is very good indeed
on defense. “Jankoskie, Jimmy De-
Hart’s big gun, was late starting, but
he came back with a vim in his latter

additional duties as an assistant to the
varsity manager. He will be chosen by
the football letter men, election to be

Our center position goes. to Bill
Metts, that tough boy from Gus Te-
bell’s camp. Metts is good enough for
any man’s line and we rate him the
best of a good crop this year. Riggs
McConnell of Davidson is our next
choice. In every game this season, the
Wildcat star has led his team on de-
fense. He is a peppy, wide-awake
leader and a man who will never stop
fighting. Schwartz of Carolina, Hunt-
er of Duke, and Parker of Wake For-
est, are all good, with the first two
probably the best. Schwartz may have
torn things up in  out-of-the-state
games, but every time we have watch-
ed him play, he failed to show the ex-
traordinary ability so often attributed
him. Hunter played consistently well,
while Parker, only a sophomore, show-
ed that a brilliant future lies in store
for him.

The guards were not very hard to
pick, since there were two men like
Farris and Vaughan available, both
of whom have been mentioned as All-
Dixie prospects. Jones and Schuler,
veterans, get the second calf.
Brummitt, Duke, Smith and Harper,
Davidson, and Blackwood, Carolina, all
demonstrated the characteristics of
good guards but didn’t quite make the
grade,

* Weatherby, Duke, and Lepo, State,
are clearly the best of the tackles.
Weatherby’s superb play in the Caro-
lina game alone puts him in the run-
ning, but he has played great football
all year. Lepo is a big huskie and
plenty hard to handle. His brand of
play has been every bit as good as it
was last year when he sewed up an
all-state berth, and we don’t feel that
he should be removed. Weir, Demon
Deacon captain, and Kistler, captain-
elect at Duke are about the next best
in our opinion, althought Leftwitch,
Wildcat lineman, runs either one of
them a close second. Koenig and
Howard played in spurts, and did not

Kittens Meet Oak Ridge Cadets
in Opener on January Eighth
—Promising Material

The varsity basketball outfit, led by
Capt. Carl Pritchett, has completed its
third week of strenuous work-outs in
preparation for some particularly hard
tilts, slated to usher in the present cage
season. Coach Younger has covered
the fundamentals thoroughly, and is
now drilling the squad on the finer
points of the game.

New and more effective methods of
both defense and offense are being in-
troduced by Coach Younger into Da-
vidson’s court system. The five-man
defense that has formerly been used by
the Wildcat basketeers will be re-
placed this year by a very thorough
system of zone defense. With this,
Coach Younger hopes to eliminate a
great number of the crip shots that
the old method allowed the opponents.
New ahd improved methods of shoot-
ing are also being used by the Cat
cagers this season.

The first game on the present
schedule is a contest with the Furman
five on January 9. This being a tough
foe to take on in the season’s opener,
efforts will probably be made for the
Davidson cagers to see action against
some “Y" five before that date.

Having tucked their moleskins safe-

ly away after a fairly successful sea-
son, the Wildkittens have turned their
attention to perfecting themselves in
the strenuous sport of basketball, This
week marks the beginning of the third
week of practice. The practice ses-
sions are held nightly at seven-thirty
o'clock.

The squad now consists of about
thirty men, all eagerly waiting the
whistle which marks the beginning of
the first game. The practices have so
far been slightly handicapped by the
epidemic of flu that has been making
its rounds.

Coach Tilson, who is coaching the
Wildkittens, seems to be well pleased
with the way his proteges are con-
ducting themselves. It is too early in
the season to attempt to pick a team
but the following men are showing up
exceptionally well: Mathis, King, Mel-
ton, Montgomery, Lane, Potts, Arnold,
Hutaff, and Kirks. P, T. Shanks, J. E.
Ruff, and B. E. Allen, are freshman
candidates for manager.

The schedule has not been completed,
but a trip is being arranged that will
carry the team into Virginia. The
first game will probably be played on
the eighth of January with Oak Ridge.

A year ago OLD GOLD'S holiday message to its many

friends was entitled .. . “OLD GOLD'S first Christmas.”

OLD GOLD was then just the infant prodigy among ciga-

rettes. But, thanks to its three million new friends, and

its countless old ones, OLD GOLD has grown four hundred

per cent. The infant has become a strapping young giant.

OLD GOLD is America’s fastest growing cigarette. You

have given OLD GOLD a wonderful Christmas by your

kind patronage and cordial good-will. And in deepest

appreciation we say to all our friends ... ‘May your

Christmas be as merry as you have made OLD GOLD’S.”?

We thank you.
