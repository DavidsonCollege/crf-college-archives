Kittens Drop Season Opener

To Appalachian State JVs

By BOB WETZEL
Staff Writer

Davidson's junior Varsity
football squad dropped its
season and home opener to Ap-
palachian State's JVs. 8-0

However, the 0-0) halttrime
score Is More indicative of the
relative strength of the two
teams, according to Mike Kelly .
the student assistant in charge
ot the JV program

All the scoring came late in
the game. Davidson handed the
Visitors a 2-0 lead when the cen-
ter’s snap went over the Kitten
punter’s head and rolled out of
the end zone for a safety.

Appalachian’s other six poin-
ts came on a short-range touch-
down pass in the closing
moments of the contest.

Kelly was still pleased with
his team’s performance in spite
of the final tally.

“We definitely out-hit them.
Our defense was superb. We
probably could have put the
game away early if not for a few
offensive mistakes,’ Kelly said.

According to Kelly. the squad
is made up of 35 freshmen
recruits and eight student
volunteers who responded to the
football office's recent “call for
bodies."

However, eight of the fresh—
men were held out of Monday's
game until the fourth quarter
because of their importance to
the varsity.

‘We played real good football
when you consider that we
really only had two days of
practice as a team.” Kelly
noted.

He went on to point out that
the freshmen gridders had ser-
ved primarily as a “scout
team” for the varsity. running
the nexi opponent's plays. thus
far this fall and had not had
much time to work on their own
plays.

The student volunteers did
not practice previous to: last
weekend

Kelly listed Gary Hutchison,

bill Winkenwerder Mike
Eubanks. and Steve Bell as ot
tensive standouts the

were Jim Spears, Joe Trahan,

fast.’ Kelly noted.
