Baseball—and nine letter men back!
Watch the ryig season.

We might at least do honor to Wash-
ington by having a holiday on his birth-
day.

Eighteen more days, Juniors. We feel
for you.

The man who predicted that the R.
QO. ‘V. C. would start up March 1, was
about right.

There are still some men who persist
in cutting up the campus by. ugly little
paths.

COLLEGE SPIRIT.

Davidson men have probably as much
college spirit as students of any other in-
stitution, and yet is this spirit what. it
used to-be or what it should be? De-
cline or rise in pep is often difficult to
explain, many attributing the former to
Jack of class spirit, owing to the fact
that except for the name there are no
distinctions to speak of between any two
of the four classes, “Phere are no inter-
class competitions or contests, which
would tend to stimulate rivalry and
foster class pep. One class is on practi-
cally an even footing with another, so
that the student body resembles. to a cer-
tain extent, one large class rather than
four. Each class is supposed to have col-
ors and a yell, but the majority of the
men have no idea what they are. They
sit apart in chapel and church, and up-
per classmen take more advanced studies
and hold more offices, but except for this
there is practically no distinction be-
tween them. It is a pretty well accepted
belief that class spirit has been declining
on the campus and its now pretty well
extinct. And some think that this lack
of class spirit will injure or weaken the
college spirit. The precedent of class
spirit would have to grow up gradually
and would require concerted action. The
whole thing is a question which deserves
fair thought.

As to college spirit, it has been sug-
gested that it could better be kept up by
establishing customs which would have
a certain degree of formality and dig:

The DAVIDSONIAN, February 19, 1919

nity. Such suggestions are often receiv
ed with derision by the average college
boy but a fair trial will not prove them
altogether impracticable. One _ thing
mentioned is to have a distinctive David-
con song, so that when it is played or
sung, every Davidson man will stand at
attention with head uncovered, in the
same way In which he shows his respect
for The Star-Spangled Banner. Fel-
lows, see if this it not an idea that im-
proves on acquaintance. A number of
other such customs might be suggested,
and The Davidsonian will be only too
glad to publish articles discussing such
questions, if anyone will be so inclined
to set his thoughts down on paper.

KEEP BEHIND THE TEAM.

The best spirit a student body can
show is to take victory and defeat with
agrin—to refrain from boasting and
“crowing” in the first place, and to keep
cheerful and cut out excuses in. the sec-
end. Such a spirit is rare, and the stu-
dent body that has it, makes an enviable
rep for its college. No excuses or ex-
planations are necessary for the defeats
suffered on the recent basketball trip
thru the state and into Virginia. We
know every man on the squad did’ his
best and put up a game fight; and in the
main that’s why a student body should
back its team to the dimit—and that’s
why it does. Davidson will get far more
credit by taking: its medicine cheerfully
than to have won every game on the trip.

Nor is there any reason for the team
to become disheartened. “he student
body of course wants it to win; but in
either case it is right behind the team.
and will back it all the way thru the
season,

MINISTERIAL BAND FEED
IS WELL ATTENDED

On last Saturday night the members
of the Ministerial Band had a very en-
jovyable “feed.” Promptly at 1o o'clock
the door of the upper right-hand room of
the “Y" opened and the members of the
band had the pleasure of looking upon a
long table covered with a great quantity
and variety of “eats.”. All took seats
while Currie, the President of the Band.
made a few remarks on the prirpose of
the Band, the responsibility resting, upon.

Jit, and what part it should play in the

coming campaign.

linmediately after this the — fellows
proceeded to make way with the “eats.”
Though there was an abundant supply
of everything, it lasted but a very few
minutes with the thirty-one men present.

Following this was an hour of joke
telling by those disposed to do so, and
also by some not disposed to. Some great
‘ones were told. “The “dog” goes to
Matthews, Cumming, Dendy and Me-
Clov. Ata late hotir, after giving a few
vells evervone left. feeling that the oc-
casion had heen a great success.

The “Band” expressed its appreciation
to Harrell and McGirt for the good
work thev did in purchasing and spread-
ing the “eats.”

RUMPLE STILL LEADS
IN BIBLE CLASSES

The attendance at the morning Bible
classes last Sunday registered 112, this
number being divided as follows: North
Wing Chambers, 16; South Wing
Chambers, 24; Georgia, 14; Watts, 25;
and Rumple, 33. Rumple again led with
the best average, having 33 men present
out of a possible so.

The attendance shows a slight de-
crease from that of the preceding Sun-
day, this probably being due to the fact
that quite a number of fellows spent the
week-end off the Hill.

Miss Flora McNair and Miss E.
Mills were visitors on the Hill last Sat-
urday.

FRESH-SOPH DEBATE

eS eee

SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 17 Gentlemen!

‘The preliminaries for the Fresh-Soph
debate will be held in the society halls
on Monday, March 17, at which time
the Fresh-Soph team will be selected to
represent their respective sucieties in the
final debate on March 31. Last year
was the first time this contest was held
between the societies, It created much
interest and gave the members of the
two lower classes a means of settling an
argument which they usually carry on the
whole year. So this year the Eumenean
Soph ‘and Fresh are out for revenge,
which will bring out large numbers in
the Philanthropic,

The subject for the preliminaries and
final is, “Resolved, ‘Chat all able -bodied
men in the United States should be
compelled to take one year of military
training before they are twenty-one years
old.”

After the final debate the. judges will
decide which society has the strongest
team and who is the best debater on each
team to whom will be awarded the de-
bater’s: medal by their societies.

So Freshmen and Sophomores get to
work, show the other fellows that you
can debate. Remember it is only four
weeks off, and there is no time to lose.

TENNIS AND ‘PRACK MEET
PLANS UNDER WAY

“Bob” Cunningham, the manager, has
some interesting schedules planned for
these who are followers of the ball and
racquet, A tournament has been arrang-
ed for the first week in March.

A good deal of interest has © been
shown all thru the term in this particu-
lar sport and it is hoped that even more
will be brought out in the next month.

Captain. McQueen, of the fleet-footed
crew, has been watching the weather
with rather a dubious eve for the last
week, but regardless of the present con-
ditions, the track is soon to be in shape
toe accommodate all those who have any
desire to become members of the track
squad.

Several meets have been planned for
the spring season. One will be an in-
ter-class contest from which most likely
the Varsity will be chosen. There will
be a state meet later in the spring which
will be followed by a meet at Georgia
Tech.

There are quite a number of men: in
college who ought to set some new rec-
ords and put Davidson first on the list
in this line.

If you can’t run, try jumping: if not
that.’ throw the weights. and if none of
these are in your line, come out and get
some exercise,

“Guv" Humphries, ‘18, has heen dia-
charged from the Marine Corps and ex-
pects to enter college again.
