Shining Star Seen by , Handbooks Have Arrived---Best

Friday Night

The gloom that spread over the stu-
dent body after the report of the Clem-

son game was soon turned into laughter,
when Douglas Fairbanks appeared on.

{

iat “Y” services was reached last Sun- -

the screen in the “Modern Muskateers”
Friday night at the “Y.” This was the
best picture that has been shown this

year and was enjoyed by all the stu-:
and!

dents, as well as by the faculty
town people.

Lewis is operating the machine with
great success. Very little time was ta-
ken up with changing the reels, so that
the whole thing moved along without
a particle of trouble.

The “Y” was very fortunate in hav-
ing contracted with the Paramount-
Artcraft Corporation for weekly pic-
tures.

Good Prospects for Vic-
tory Against W. & L.

Opponents Handicapped by Lack of
Experienced Men

Journeying to Lexington, Va., next
Saturday, Davidson will meet Wash-
ington and Lee on the latter’s athletic
field. The prospects for another Wild-
cat. victory are good, although the
ability of the Generals must not be un-
derestimated. The White and Blue
warriors will be out full of fight, to
avenge last year’s defeat, when David-
son won from them on Sprunt Field, 20
to o.

The prospects at Washington and
Lee are none too bright, according to
accounts, ‘The lack of veteran material
is hampering the work of coaches to a
great extent. Of those men who faced
the Wildcats last year, only Abrogast,
Bock and Barrow are back. Abrogast,
the stellar halfback who gained so much
of Washington and Lee’s ground last
year, is the dangerous one of this trio.
From the 1917 team, those who are back
again are Raines, Corbett, Patterson,
and Henderson, Besides these men, the
only other veteran players are Moore
and Bethel, of the 1916 team. Bethel
is a guard, and is noted throughout Vir-
ginia as a star football and basketball
player.

The team that Washington and Lee
faces this year is a different type than
that of last year. Even with the ad-
vantage of playing on their own field,
the Generals will not have all the odds
their own way. With a victory from
last year, and a better team this year,
Davidson can go into the game with
more confidence. Every man with the
exception of two on the Wildcat squad
knows the style of the Washington and
Lee attack, whereas only a few of the
Generals of this year played against
Davidson last year, and their knowl-
edge will not hurt much, as the team is
being coached differently this year un-
der Coach Crayton.

Emerging from a defeat at the hands
of Clemson by a bad break which gave
the Tigers an easy chance to score, Da-
vidson goes into the game Saturday with
two victories and one defeat. She has
scored 54 points against her opponents’
7. With the same line-up, the team is
due to be in better shape than in any
previous game and with even breaks,
another scalp should be added to the
list. The line-up will probably be:
Douglas and Miley, ends; McMaster
and Hammett,’ tackles; LaFar and
Romefelt, guards; Brady, center; Black
and Johnson, halfbacks; Shepherd, full-
back; Spann, quarterback.

§. M. Davis, 18, and D. V. Hudson,
17, are studying medicine in the Medi-
cal Department of the University of
Maryland.

at “Y” Service

Chinese Student Gives Description of
Student Movement in China

The largest attendance ever recorded

day evening, when three hundred and
twenty students turned out for the ser-
| vice as a birthday present for Bob Miles,
| the “Y” secretary.

And those who were present did not
regret it, for the service was above the
ordinary.
government student, who has just come
from China, talked on the vital condi-
‘tions which affect China today. Meng
held his audience from his first to his
last word, while he told of situations in
China of which the majority were en-
i tirely ignorant.

After thanking the student body for
the friendly attitude towards him since
his arrival on the campus, Meng said
that he wished to speak, not on China
as a whole, but only on a few of the
conditions existing there. Japan, Meng
: Went on to say, is responsible for a great
deal of the trouble existing in China to-
day. Japan endeavored to force the
twenty-one demands on China; she is
‘endeavoring to undermine the Chinese
people by encouraging opium = smug-
gling, in direct violation of international
law. A’ growing antagonism against
Japan broke out into active demonstra-
tion when the students in Peking band-
ed together into the student movement,
on May 4, 1919. ‘This movement has
spread rapidly all over China through
the zeal of its members. ‘The govern-
ment endeavored. to suppress the street
speaking of the students, and threw
many into prison. Popular feeling, how-
ever, caused the government to change
its policy, and the students were soon
released. The student movement has
aroused the nation to its need for de-
fence and for defensive armaments, and
is thus accomplishing its purpose.

The, Christian religion plays an im-
portant part in China’s future. Fifteen
years ago, popular sentiment was vio-
lently anti-Christian. In general, at
the present time, the attitude towards
Christianity is very favorable. If the
missionaries are given support, they can
change and mould the China of the fu-
ture. The missionaries need educational
institutions, hospitals and — training
schools. ‘There is only ene preacher for
every 130,000 people and the need for
more workers is self evident. With the
aid of the Christian Church, China can
arouse itself from its sleep. ‘he har-
vest is ripe, but the laborers are few.
America alone can supply the need.

Meng said, in conclusion, that during
his short stay of two years here, he
hoped to make many friends. And, fur-
ther, he hoped that the United States
and China would come to a better un-
derstanding and a deeper friendship for
each other.

A very enjoyable variation of the
usual seryice was a quartet, composed
of B. E. Shields, A. G. Oltman, A. L.
Currie and A. D. McArn, who gave
two very beautiful selections.

Bob Miles will commence next Sun-
day a series of talks dealing with cam-
pus life and problems.

Hard Fought Game Lost, 7 to 0—Clemson Outplayed in First Half, but Came
Back Strong in Second

In one of the hardest fought and most

Field, Davidson lost to Clemson by a
score of 7 to o last Friday afternoon.
The wet field and unusually warm
weather did not interfere with the sen-
sational playing of both teams.

Davidson completely- outplayed the
Tigers in the first half, making practi-

‘vally two first downs to Clemson's one.
The Crimson seriously threatened the
Clemson goal line on four occasions dur-

ing this half. ‘Fhey several times car-
tied the ball to the five-yard line but

‘lacked the drive to carry it across at one
time. With the ball in their possession
on Clemson's two-yard line and first
down, it seemed that the Wildcats had
a sure touchdown but the whistle blew,
ending the half and depriving Davidson
of its best chance to score.

The Tigers came back strong in the
second half, having a little the better of
the argument in this period. Captain
Banks paved the way for a Clemson
score with a brilliant fifty-yard sprint in
the third quarter, placing the ball on the
Wildeats’ four-yard line. Davidson held
here but had hard luck when Johnston's
punt from behind the line struck the
goal post and Clemson recovered on Da-
vidson's  cight-yard line. Vhree line
bucks failed and Coach Donahue sent in
Roper at) quarter, who hurled a_ pass
over the goal line to Potts. “This score
was ruled out, however, because Roper
called signals on the first play after en-
tering the game. ‘The ball was given to
Davidson on their twenty-yard line and
Jehnston punted to Clemson's forty-
five-yard line. Here Clemson started
their drive down the field which result-
ed in. a tuuchdown, After taking two
first downs, Captain Banks, who had
replaced Allison at half, carried the ball
to the two-fuot line and Armstrong
bucked over the Wildcats’ right side for
the only touchdown, Harris kicked
goal and the score stood: Clemson 7;
D. C. 0. This ended the third quarter.

Honors were almost evenly divided in
the fourth quarter. “The ball see-sawed
back and forth in the middle of the
field with neither team able to gain
much ground. ‘The game ended with
the ball in) Davidson's possession on
Clemson's forty-five-yard line,

the game for Clemson.

Two Young Ladies to Open
Lyceum Course Here

for Next Wednesday Night

The first’ number of the Lyceum
Course is scheduled for October 15, the
Rich-Werno Company being the per-
formers. ‘These two young ladies have
travelled over the entire country for sev-
eral years in Lyceum work. They are
especially good in’ dialogues, sketches,
and costume work. "This entertainment
will be held in Shearer Hall and all of

excellent defensive game. Harris also

Lightsey and Gettys did good work in
the line.

In the backfield for Davidson Black

to gain when called upon to carry the
ball. Captain Spann played his usual
good game at quarter, Brady and Ham-
mett were the chief stars in the line, re-
peatedly throwing Clemson backs for
no gain or a loss. Hammett is prov-
ing a tower of strength and one of the
best’ tackles in the whole South. The
whole D. C. team showed surprising
strength, though handicapped by a wet
field and heavier opponents, and deserve
great credit for the fight which they
pat up.

Davidson's attack consisted mostly of
line bucks. Although the muddy field
and wet, ball made the aerial style of
play difficult, the Wildcats also succeed-
ed in completing no less than eight for-

Phi Society Members
Make Merry at Feed

Prof. Currie Speaks—Many New Men
Taken In

Last Saturday night the Gymnasium
was the scene of great epicurean and
gustatory festivities, The occasion was
a feed given by the Philanthropic Liter-
ary Society to all) students who hail
from North Carolina. The purpose of
the feed was to secure a general social
get-together of the members of the so-
ciely and those who contemplate? — be-
coming members. The affair was a de-
cided success and in spite of thre. fact
that July 1 has come and gone, good
spirits were there in abundance.

‘The meeting was opened with an ad-
dress by Professor Currie. Professor

, Currie. said that his most pleasant recol-

lections of college days were those that
were associated with his work in the lit-
erary society. This work in the literary
saciety was also the most beneficial.

_ Latin, Greek and Chemistry are good
‘in their way and will be of benefit to a

professor of language or a chemist but

ithe ability to speak well is essential to

all eccupations and professions, A stu-
dent who expects to study law or be a
minister, in: Professor Currie’s opinion,
commits a crime against himself and
against society at large, if he fails to
take advantage of the literary societies.
Professor Currie, while recommend-
ing both societies, said that no one
makes a mistake by joining the Phi,
Professor Currie showed that the
method of learning to speak in the so-
cieties was the best possible method.
‘When one learns by participation and
imitation as one does in the literary so-
cieties what he learns stays with him.

and it is Professor Currie's belief that
it is not likely to do so soon. ‘Whe day

Lof the orator is rather dawning anew

and bringing with it greater possibili-

have taken the place of the orator, ‘are
