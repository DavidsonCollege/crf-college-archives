Traffic safety agency monitors aute safety, defects

By STEVE AUSTIN

~ Did you know that there is a
number you can call toll free to
report any problems or ask any
questions concerning your car?
The National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration’s Hot-
line (1-800-424-9898) is one
more attempt on the part of this
agency to better serve the

- public.

In 1966, the NHTSA was
ees to take on the respon-
sibility formerly shared by eight
different departments. The dra-
matic result was a reduction in

the model year 1984. Lap and
shoulder belts required since
1968 provide the same protec-
tion but only when used: less
than twenty percent of the dri-
ving public are willing to buckle
up. In 1977, over 10,000 people
could have been saved if they
had used their seatbelts.

Two types of passive re-
straint systems are now possi-
bilities. The first is a safety belt
that automatically comes into
place when the door closes.
Such a system is currently
available on the Volkswagen
Rabbit. The second system is

“the traffic fatality rate (the —theair cushion which inflates on

number of deaths per 100
- million miles driven) from 6.48
in 1966 to 4.11 in 1974. Incep-
tion of the 55 mile-per-hour
speed limit in 1974 brought the
rate down to 3.52 in a year’s
time. If the fatality rate had
just remained constant at the
3.52 1967 level, 77,000 people
would have been killed in 1977

compared to the actual figure of
g

48,000. .
~~ What does the NHTSA do
that has produced such tremen-
dous results? It is a diversified
agency: researching safety pro-
biems and solutions, investiga-
ting potentially defective car
products, issuing safety stan-
dards for products of the auto-
motive industry. Recently, it
has been given the additional
responsibility of helping to cut
fuel usage through design modi-
fications and regulations,
The NHTSA is currently

involved in trying to make a

impact, distributing the force of
the collision over the whole
body. '

The seatbelts would cost
approximately $50 whereas the
air bag would be over $100.
Estimating that 10,000 lives
could be saved annually if either
of these restraint systems were
made mandatory, the NHTSA
considers the added expense
minimal. «

amount of time researching
safety features of the future.

way to achieve any improve-
ments. Having been exposed to
so many different areas, Hall
Advisors have the insight to
address a broad range of ideas.

Lastly, the portrayal of Mel-
ton appears clearly subjective,
with such descriptions as “‘visi-
bly uncomfortable,” forcefully
denied,’’ ’’would only say,”
“admit,” “hoodwink,” ete. By
using the word ‘‘denied’”’ so

often, the implication is made

that he actually had something
to cover up. We feel that the
only possible reason for Mel-
ton’s discomfort was the bring-
ing up of some trivial point that
he could not rationalize.
Granted, the selection of Hall
” Advisors could have beens
“matter of convenience.” Yet
we feel that Melton’s key point
~-that the entire school has been
given the opportunity to talk to

the Trustees at almost all of

their past meetings but rarely
used. ‘the opportunity”-- was
not stressed.

Our objection lies not in the

individual passages or points of

the article; it rests in its
implications. If analyzed close-
‘ly, only one question is raised
by the article: why were only

Melton denies a certain point,
should have been asked: why
were only the department chair-
men selected to carry out simi-
lar interviews?. We feel that the
answers are evident. As a total

the power of suggestion is quite

‘forceful. The average reader

does not stop to analyze a front

nian. Doubt over Melton’s true
