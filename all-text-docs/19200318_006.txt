same purpose, was merged into O.

AMERICANS TO SHOW
LOVE FOR FRANCE

Davidson Students to Have Oppor-
tunity of Contributing to Fund
for Erection of Monument.

On July 4, 1885, the United States’
celebrated the birthday of our lib-
erty. Gifts came from all parts of
the world in token of friendship,
but the one gift which will never be
forgotten and has become such a
part of our free American spirit, was
the giant statue in New York har-
bor — “Liberty Enlightening the!
World.” This was the gift of the’
people of France to the people of:
America. The “people” did not mean:
the government of France. The!
money came from rich and poor—!
from the eager hands of little chil-
dren—from the palsied hands of old,
men—from the widow—from the or- |
pha. Each gave a share.

POLITY CLUB TO HEAR

PROF. KIMBALL TONIGHT |

(

Tonight at 7:30 p. m., in Shearer’
hall, Prof. Everett Kimball will’
speak to the Davidson Polity Club. |
He will probably speak on some,
phases of the United States and her
foreign affairs. Professor Kimball:
comes from Smith College, North- |
ampton, Mass., where he has had
much success in his line of work. ;
His lectures have been heard with’

eat interest by the clubs of many!

outhern collegés this spring, which,
gives promise of an excellent talk
here.

He comes with the reputation of
being quite an authority on the sub-
ject which he has chosen for his
lecture, so the audience will no
doubt be much enlightened concern-
ing some of our country’s most per-
plexing problems. The members of
the club are expectin
large attendance on this occasion.

‘his speech entered in the national banks of the Marne.

The distinguished American sculp-|
tor, Frederick Mac Mounies, is now’
working in making sketches for the
work. He is particularly well suited
for this position as he has become
prominent as a sculptor in both
France and America. During the
war he turned his studio, near the
Marne, into a hospital. From this
fact he is best suited to interpret the
friendship of America and her ad-
miration for the heroic spirit of
France.

This monument will not be the
gift of a few; the committee wants
it to be from the masses, and so it
has given us the opportunity to
share in this gift. It 1s not the pur-
pose to urge anyone to give. The
A. E. F. students will be around and
those who care to will pay 10 cents
to these students.

A memorial book containing the
names of all cities, towns, societies,
and colleges will be placed in a mu-
seum in the base of the statue. We
want Davidson College to have her
name inscribed in this book as a last-
ing memorial to our dead in France
and our appreciation of the great
work of France in the war.

Posters and pamphlets will be dis-
tributed_as soon as they arrive tell-
ing briefly the story of the project.

et us all do our duty as each in-

an unusually | dividual sees it in helping to pay for

“America’s Gift to France.”
