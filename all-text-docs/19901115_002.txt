The public is invited toa pres-
entation of Blue Paper Shoes, a
one-person performance inspired
by the music and lyrics of John
Lennon. It will be presented in
the 900 Room on Thursday, No-
vember 15, at 8 p.m.

The performer, Rafael Lopez-
Barrantes, who lives in Chapel
Hill, describes the production as
a theater “moment” inspired by

‘Lennon, rather than a portrait of
Lennon’s life. Barrantes will be
the only person on stage during
the performance. This one-hour
play focuses on his portrayal of
Lennon’s ghost, and employs
various theatre mediums such as
drama, sound and choreographed
dance and gestures. As the ghost
cooks dinner, becomes a speaker

ent personalities, he creates a meta-
phorical suggestion of Lennon’s

Blue Paper Shoes has been
performed in theaters in Chicago,
Chapel Hilland France. S. Baun of
Chicago Performance Arts Maga-
zine said, ““Barrantes sculpted in-
tonations and theatrical energy
gave Lennon’s lyrics an added
weight and depth...”

The text for the show was
written by Lopez-Barrantes’ wife,
Ellen Hemphill, who admired
Lennon’s work. She said she
“wanted to create this piece 10
years after his death; not only in
homage to this man, but also to
remind us of how his music and
poetry influenced a generation of
people throughout the world.”

to the local hospital for some more
“routine” tests. By this time, I was
on the verge of panicking. I re-
member sitting fearfully in the
hospital chapel fervently praying
that all would be all right.

The doctor eventually ap-
peared at the end of the hall and
motioned for me to come into my
father’s chaplain’s office. He sat
down in front of me, looked me
directly in the eyes, and saidcalmly,
but firmly, those words II] likely
never forget, “David, you have a
form of leukemia.” I remember
that at that point I made a feeble
attempt to make a joke, comment-
ing that, “Gee, I guess that I will
miss the basketball game tonight.”
Unfortunately, my fake smile could
not hide the absolute absence of
hope that I felt at that moment.

The next four weeks that De-
cember were not exactly my ideal
way of spending Christmas vaca-

_tion. lunderwenta rather grueling
series of tests and chemotherapy.

My body was literally bombed with ©

medication after medication.

; Up. until this point in my life,
medicines had names like Sudafed
and Robitussin, but now they had
more ominous-sounding names
like L-aspariginase, Cytoxin,
methotrexate and prednisone. At
the end of this four-week barrage,
I had achieved a disease- free State

called remission.

Over the next five months I
entered the hospital about every
three weeks to receive continuous

drips of chemotherapy for three or

four days at a time.

This medication was designed
to knock the leukemia into a per-
manent remission. It also caused
much nausea, baldness, anda forty-
five pound weight gain. Atthe end
of this five-month period, I hardly
recognized my own reflection in
the mirror.

Thankfully, at the end of this

seven months, from May until
December, I took mecatupurine
pills every day, as well as, having
a weekly blood test and an injec-
tion of methotrexate. I began a
rigorous workout/diet regimen and
took a summer job in the moun-
tains at a restaurant.

My summer turned out to be
great: I lost the excess thirty-five
pounds, I got back into decent
physical condition through play-
ing tennis and basketball regularly,
girls re-entered my social life and
things seemed to be restored to
normal. At the end of August, I
looked ahead to my freshman year
at Davidson College with high
expectations.

My fall semester was likely
very similar to any other fresh-
man’s first dose of college life. I
struggled through the delightful
“reviews” in my classes; I reveled
in the variety of ways to spend a
weekend “creatively” and at the
same time--I felt I had become a
part of the campus community.
Once again, it seemed that as if all
was right with the world.

ber thinking that this sounded like
a drastic and radical procedure,
and in many ways, itcertainly was.
To havea bone marrow transplant,

Statistics that were offered
were less-than-thrilling--only one
out of four people have a genetic
“match” within their family. Due
to the currently limited bone mar-
row registry, the odds of finding a
“match” in the general population
isaone-in-twenty-thousand propo-
sition. Notexactly the type of odds
on which you’d place a huge wa-
ger.

Later that week, tests proved
that, miraculously, God' had pro-
vided me a genetically identical
match in the form of my beloved,
younger sister, Lee. Iknew that the
road ahead was paved with ex-
tremely daunting physical and
emotional obstacles, but I felt as-
sured that this was one battle that

Casolo then began the testi-
mony of her experiences working
with the Salvadoran people. Her
voice was strong with conviction
and feeling as she recounted sto-
ries of her work with the Brethren
Volunteer Services, an organiza-
tion committed to peace, justice
and human rights. Her work in-

Salvadorans.

Well, the-month-of December- ~ Clinic witha twelve-year old friend

rolled around. It was about ten

days before exams were to begin..

Sunday evening, I helped lead my
freshman hall basketball team to
our first I.M.A.C. victory. The next
day I went to Charlotte for my
monthly bone marrow aspiration.

After the test, I returned to
school and went about my daily
routine totally oblivious to what
lay in store for me.

The next day, I felt as if once
again the rug had been pulled out
from under me. The doctor called
with the grim news that the cancer
had reappeared in my blood.

I remember wondering, as I
headed to my car in the Belk park-

_ ing lot that afternoon, when would
be the next time that I would be at

school. As it would turn out, the
next time that I would set foot on
campus would be-months later.

My doctor said thatat this point,

of mine, Jason, who was in need of
a bone marrow donation.

I'll never forget my encourag-
‘ing assurances to him that, “Don’t
worry, I’m sure that they’ll find
you a “match’.” The look of hope
in his eyes is one that I'll likely
never forget.

‘When I returned at the end of
April from my grueling transplant
experience, I began my monthly
check-ups. A mere two weeks af-
ter my return, I entered the office
and asked how Jason was doing in
finding a match.

Casolo quickly responded by ac-
Stay tuned...

Casolo spoke of the night she

was arrested for allegedly hiding
arms for the FMLN, She also re-
lated her experiences during her
interrogation and her later impris-
onment.

At this point, after singing a
song in Spanish, Casolo noticed a
group of people in the back of the
room holding up El Salvador’s
national flag. A dialogue between
Casolo and the individuals from
such countries as Cuba, El Salva-
dor and Guatemala began. These
individuals expressed their anger
with Casolo, claiming that she
distorted many facts about the situ-

knowledging the rights of these

_h

her testimony was based on her —
own experiences in El Salvador.
As the tensions ebbed slightly,
Casolo concluded the discussion
by pointing out that if the common
goal of all sides is human rights,
then an argument over semantics
and unwarranted accusation is
fruitless.

Casolo’s talk prpyoked apany
feelings in most members of the
audience. Some were very recep-
tive to Casolo, and felt that she was
a charismatic and powerful per-
son. Religion professor David
Kaylor pointed out that what Ca-
solo gave was “a very personal
recounting of her own experiences
and events that happened to her.
Wit she did not give was a dis-
pas.-onate, intellectual analysis of

the Situation-in“E}' Salvador. Her
~ convictions | stem: from her. deep

association with the people. ” Many
others were deeply impressed by

in the standing ovation that she
received at the end of her talk.
Many left the 900 Room inspired
and uplifted by her dedication to
the people.

But others were very angry by
what they felt to be her misrepre-
sentation of the situation in El
Salvador. Cristina Lépez-Ibafiez,
a student at Davidson who hails
from Guatemala, felt Casolo was
able to evoke emotions and there-
fore “manipulate” a vast majority
of Davidson students whoare naive
about the situation in El Salvador:
into taking her side as the truth.
L6pez-Ibafiez felt that Casolo.
brought only one view of the situ-
ation to Davidson. “That’s not
education; that’s indoctrination.
Education is bringing both sides
into view. Our pointis this one: we
(the “rich” in Latin America) want
equal rights for everybody so we
canall live better lives. What people
don’t understand, or refuse to
understand, is that it’s easier to be
a guerrilla than to work. It’s alsoa
lot easier to blame the rich for
everything,” she said.
