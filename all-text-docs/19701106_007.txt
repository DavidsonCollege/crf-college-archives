Head Coach Terry Holland
has announced that the first
major basketball scrimmage
has been set for Nov. 19°in
the ‘Charlotte Coliseum,
when the varsity Wildcats
meet the freshmen Wildkit-
tens,

“This will be a very im-
portant scrimmage, since
the team needs to work un-
der game conditions.”’ Hol-
land commented.

“We plan to added.a few
new ‘wrinkles to last” yéars
offense, the basic change in-
volving shifting the stack of-
fense to the right side of
the court.”

Holland stated the _ pre-
sence of left handed shoot-
érs was one of the reasons
he decided sto switch the
stack.

He plans to invite all the
high school teams in the
Charlotte area, and the gen-
eral public is also invited.
There is no charge.’

Concerning the _ starting
team, Holland stated ‘I
can’t begin to give you an
idea of the starting five.’’
He said that each day two
or three different players
have outstanding practices.

Overall. Holland _ stated
Eric Minkin has shown the
greatest rate of improve-
ment. He also had high
praise for sophomores Gor-
don Graham and John Pe-
corak.

‘John Pecorak is just do-
ing an exceptional - job,"
stated Holland.

“T'm having problems
finding a spot to fit him in.
He may be a post man,
though he is a little short at
6'6"". He. also could play
open wing.”

He also thought that Gra-
ham, 6’3" guard, had shown
a lot of promise in practice.

Grid Club Interest

By JOE EARLE

Students interested in
playing “feotfall onan _inter-
collegifite level, bul unable

’ to play on the varsity team

may find an outlet in club
football.

Some members of the Da-
vidsen community have ex-
pressed interest in organiz-
ing a Davidson football club.

Several _ schools. in the
area have organized clubs,
including The University of
North Carolina, North Caro-

lina State University, and
(East Carolina.
“This is real football,

played by boys who would
like to play football on a
collegiate level, but cannot
find the time to participate
on the varsity,” stated C.
Shaw Smith director of Stu-
dent Union.

Smith has been very _in-
volved with the club at UNC
because his son is a kicker
for the team.

He is very interested in
seeing a program organized
at Davidson because he feels
that-there are many students
on campus who would be in-

terested in playing in a foot- »

ball league, but for yarious

reasons are unable to parti-
cipate in the present system
of varsity ‘athletics.

“(Most of all the club: sys-
fem allows a player to have
just a great amount of fun,”
he said, ‘‘without the usual
pressures that accompany
regular varsity athletics.”

The team at UNC includes
students, graduate students
and members of the faculty.

The operating money for
the club is raised by the
club. members, and each
player is responsible for
supplying his own equip-
ment.

Smith said he felt a sys-

tem of club football at Da-*

vidson could be most easily
organized through some ex-
isting organization, such as
the Union, the YMCA, or the
SGA.

‘He feels it best that the
team be coached by interest-
ed faculty members.

The club at UNC was or-

ganized through the Dean of °

Student Affairs office's.
Smith, emphasised the fact
that the football club was
to be in no. way in competi-
tion with regular varsity
athletics.
“This is for people: who

Jacksonville picked up
three quick goals in the first
period on their way to. the
victory and added two in the
final stanza.

‘However both Fogleman
and assistant Peter Sterling
were pleased with David-
son's effort in the loss.

“Jacksonville has to be
rated among the top three
soccer teams in the South

and included in the top
twenty in the. country,”
Sterling said. .

“They passed real well

love football,” he said, ‘but
are unable to play on the
varsity level,’

“It_is in no way intended
to supplant what now
exists,’ Smith. stated, ‘but
is to enlarge upon it.”

The club at UNC claims
that ‘they are organized to
play ‘‘football for fun."'

Smith commented. on the
excitement that | accom-
pained one of the game he
attended. He stated it was a
game in which everyone
played just for the pleasure
of playing, and every team
member participated.

According to UNC litera-
ture there are plans for two
teams, a regular club and
a 160-pound club.

and were’ very quick. They
had to be the best team we

faced in a long time,’ Fogle-
man added.
‘Neither he or _ Sterling

could explain the fast scor-
ing attack Jacksonville
mounted in the first period.

“We had terrible lapses
en defense,”” Fogleman said.
“TL think we should have
played them to a 1-0 or. 2-0
game.”

Fogleman explained that
Davidson gave Jacksonville
four of their five goals.

“Three of their goals
bounced off our fullback and
the other came on a penalty
kick,”

Fogleman and Sterling both
praised Guamundur Karts-
son and Joe Yochem for
their effort in the loss.

‘Davidson suffered its” se:
cond loss of the season last
Friday as they were downed
by “East Carolina, 3-1. John
Bruner—registered—the—only.
goal for the ‘Cats.

Several of the players and
the coaches felt the squad
was looking ahead for the
Jacksonville and Citadel
games in the loss. They al-
so explained that East Caro-
lina played one of their best
game of the season.

Coaches ‘Fogleman = and
Sterling said they felt the
loss of Tim Winter and Dick
Spinner have hurt the squad
in the past two games.

(Both have been out with
injuries and are expected to
be able to play in tomor-
row’s game with The Cita-
