Debate, Saturday night, Uctoger 27:
Resolved, That suffrage should be re-
stricted by an educational qualification.

Humphrey, Hollandsworth. Negative:
Burgess, Sullivan, McGirt. eclama-
tions: Byrd, Harrell.

Philanthropic — Affirmative:
drey and Pharr. Negative:
castle and Sample. Extemporaneous:

At the Phi Society meeting on fast
Saturday night the question debated was:
“Resolved, That intercollegiate athletics
should be suspended during the war.”

The affirmative side of the question
was upheld by C. Howell, while D. R.
Freeman and W. C. Smith presented the
negative. Both sides presented some
good points. The judges decided unani-
mously in favor of the. affirmative:

Following the regular debate was an
extemporaneous debate an the query:
“Resolved, That Freshmen should be
required to wear preen caps." W. P.
Davenport upheld the affirmative and H
C. Hamilton the negative. E.G. Lilly
then gave a very interesting and instruct-
ive oration on “Trench Warfare.”

Owing to the service conducted by the
Y. M. C. A., led by Dr. Wright, there
were no meetings of the societies last
Monday night.

In spite of an audience that did not
agree with their position, the affirmative
won in the Eumenean Society, last Sat-
urday night. The query was: Resolv-
ed, That intercollegiate athletics should
be discontinued during the war. The
affirmative was represented by Potts and
Carwile, the negative by Frierson and
Turner, The affirmative took the stand
that in these grave times intercollegiate
athletics. were ton frivolous a thing to
occupy the minds of college students,
and pointed to the large sums of money
spent on the games. Their picture of
our duty in the present crisis somewhat
overawed the negative, who relied for
their main con‘ention on the physical
henefit of athletics in training men for
the war. Thev also stressed the moral
benefit in that it would afford relaxation
to a penple whose mind now is so cen-
tered on the course and the issue of the
war. After the debate came orations by
Orgain and E. A. Woods, who told us
about “Japan and the United States”
and “Methods Against Submarines.”
The critic made a pretty zood speech,

The following second term officers
were elected: President. Bellingrath;
Vice-President, Potts; Secretary, Mc-
Girt; Reviewer, Thomas: Marshal to
fill vacancy, Frierson.

Below is given the schedule for Oc-
tober 29 of the Eumenean Freshman

chell, M. B. Heizver, R. L. Rogers.
Negative: E. L. Mahood. B. W. Rome-
felt. J. FE. Saunders. Declamations:
S. A. Burgess, C. D. Euwing.

EMORY FLINN LEADER
IN ENDEAVOR MEETING

The Christian Endeavor Society was
led by E. Flynn in its meeting last Sun-
day night. The subject, “Putting Re-
ligion Into Politics,” was thoroly dis-
cussed and many illustrations were given
to show that religion is very essential in
politics. The greatest men of the past
were men of religious character who
carried religion into politics. It was
also emphasized that our noblest men of
today are religious men who take an
active part in Christian duties. The at-
tendance was very good and the growth
o fthe society shows great advancement.

The flag looks good floating with the
autumn breeze.
