Football team ends drought with 9-6 victory

By Will Cobb

Davidson finally got the mon-
key off their back on Saturday with
a hard-fought victory on the road
against Methodist College, 9-6.

The Wildcats held on to their
three point lead as both teams were
held scoreless in the second half.
Due to circumstances and a strug-
gling offense, Head Coach Tim
Landis used six players on both
sides of the field. Two of those
‘players made big impacts en route

to the Wildcat’s first victory of the
season.

Senior Chris Leak has taken
up the tailback duties in addition to
playing linebacker, scoring the
winning touchdown ona four yard
run. Leak ended up the day with 86
yards on 34 carries. Another ver-
satile player included junior. de-
fensive end Bo Bartholomew, who
lined up as the fullback on offense.
Bartholomew served as lead
blocker for Leak and ended the

Monarchs’ chances for a victory
with a quarterback sack on third
down and four with 1 8 seconds left
inthe game. .,

' The Wildcats got on the
scoreboard in the first quarter when
sophomore outside linebacker A.R.
Barrington blocked a Methodist
punt out of the end zoné to put the
Wildcats up 2-0. The Monarchs
answered with a touchdown in the
second quarter, but the extra point
was blocked.

Davidson scored the last points
of the game on Leak’s touchdown
run. Senior Sean Callahan re-
mained perfect on the season with
the extra point.

The team’s MVP would have
to be the defensive line, holding
the Monarchs to less than one yard
per carry (35 yards on 37 carries).
Methodist managed just 112 and
seven first downs yards of total
offense on the afternoon. The of-
fense has continued to sputter as

the Wildcats managed just 157
yards themselves. The quarterback
situation still remains undecided:
as senior Kevin Holzworth and
freshman Hamilton Hill continue
to split time.

Davidson will travel to
Randolf-Macon seeking their sec-
ond win of the season next Satur-
day.

The team’s final home game
will be during Parent’s Weekend.
on November 5.

Women's
cross country
has best meet
of season

By Erin Roach

This weekend, the Davidson
Wildcats traveled to McAlpine
Park in Charlotte for the North
Carolina Intercollegiate Cross
Country Championships, their
most challenging meet thus far in
the season. The women, who have
been enjoying their most success-
ful season ever, wanted to show
- everyone else in the state just how

much they have been improving.

After a very disappointing 14th
place finish at this meet last year,.
the women knew they could do
better and came to the meet Satur-
day ready torun their hardest. The
Wildcats, who have been training
intensely all season long, were
ready to reap the benefits of their
hard work. This is exactly what
they did on Saturday.

Each member planned to run .

her best time so far this season at

the meet, and the team tried to ’

work together to accomplish that
goal. But it would take more than
that to get the women to do really
well, and except for a last-minute
fiasco at the starting line, every-
thing fell into place for the women.

After the gun sounded, the
women used the competition to

_ help push them along. They ran
their first mile with blistering speed
and all concentrated on improving
their positions as they attacked the
hill on the second mile. Although
the runners were feeling exhausted
at the final mile mark, the fabulous
Davidson cheering section helped
give the Wildcats the energy they
needed to finish strong.

Personal records for the sea-
son abounded, just as the women
had hoped. Elizabeth Bishop led

_ the Wildcats and tore up the course
with a phenomenal 19:08. Erin
Roach, Stephanie Moses, and
Laura Jordan all also ran well,
clocking times of 19:23, 19:37,
and 20:05, respectively. The rest
of the Wildcats ran consistently,
all having great performances. In
the team results, the Wildcats were
excited with an 8th place finish
and were psyched wih their im-
provement over previous finishes.
The Wildcats’ next meet is the
Southern Conference Champion-
ships, which has been their focus
all season.

Volleyball team
down, but not out
since match-filled

fall break

By Traci Cliett

The Davidson volleyball team
had anything but arestful fall break.
While we were all relaxing on our
vacations, the volleyball team
played three intense matches
against Furman, Mercer, and Geor-
gia Southern.

Davidson fell to Furman and
Georgia Southern, which were both
conference matches. However,
they defeated Mercer in a decided
victory.

Since fall break, Davidson's
schedule has not gotten any easier,
but they are still quite positive about
their performance.

Last Friday, they were de-
feated by ETSU at home. And last
Saturday, Dayidson lost two
matches on the road to Hofstra and
East Carolina. Both matches were

extremely close, as has been the
case the past few weeks; most
matches have gone five games.

Senior Lorie Logan attributes
the team's losses to the number of
injuries they have now. But Logan
believes, “We are pulling together
as a team” to get through these
losses.

Junior Michele Augustin feels
the team played well over fall break
because they played together. She
thinks these “rough times are to be
expected because our coach is
changing the line up due to the
injuries.” Michele knows that “‘it
is difficult to put players in new
positions and expect them to do
well right away.”

Ever since the fifties when it
was invented, frisbee has been a
source of entertainment to young
and old at picnics in the park, fam-
ily reunions, and as a way to pass a
long Saturday afternoon. Recently,
however, anew style of frisbee has
been slowly emerging across the
nation in which this pastime is
becoming a competitive sport.

Davidson has gotten caught
up in this wave, and many students
are trying to form an Ultimate
Frisbee club team. Interested stu-
dents have been meeting for the
past month three or four days a
week to practice. If approved, the
club team would be open to both
males and females.

In order to get a club team
approved, the P.E. department re-
quires there to be an organized
interest present for at least a year
before funds can be provided for
the team. Currently, the team is
officially taking attendance at ev-

- ery practice. The list of players has
‘grown to 40. Practice usually lasts

for an hour and consists of orga-
nized pick-up games in order to
learn the rules, see the skill level,
and determine who’s really inter-
ested in playing.

“We don’ tunrealistically hope
to become a varsity sport,” says
senior J.D. Semones. “But, if the
interest is there—which it is—we
hope to become a club team arid
play other club teams in the area.”

There are many rules that the
team must learn in order to be
ready to compete. “This is new for
everyone, but we are excited about
it and people ‘are willing to
learn,”said freshman Dave
Kearfolt, who began playing
frisbee in a competitive manner in
Richmond when his high school
cross country coach had his team
play as a warm-up.

The game is played ona field -

similar to a football field, It is 70
feet long with 25 foot endzones.
Usually seven people play at time
and throw a frisbee that is between
155 and 175 grams; the heavier the
frisbee, the better. The frisbee can
only advance in the air and once
you catch it, you have ten seconds
to throw it. You can’t move while
you have the frisbee in‘your hand.
If the frisbee is dropped or de-
flected and hits the ground, it is
automatically the otherteam’s. The
other team can play immediately,
evenonaninterception. This keeps
the game constantly moving. “‘Due

to the fact that you are constantly
running, this can be an exhausting
sport,” says Kearfolt.

The key to the game is being
able to switch from offense to de-
fense quickly. Usually a man to
man style defense is played. On
the upper levels, there are plays
for offense, but college and high

school teams usually just go by the .

basic rules of thumb. A team is
awarded one point for scoring in
the endzone. Most of the time,
winning is achieved by reaching a
set score, not by competing for a
set amount of time and achieving

Students try to form ultimate frisbee club team

the highest score.

Ultimate Frisbee is a varsity
men’s and women’s sport in states
suchas Colorado, Washington, and
Arizona. There is a national tour-
nament held each year in various

Cities and the United States won

the last Ultimate Frisbee Champi-
onship against England. The sport
is spreading to the East coast, and
Duke, Wake Forest, and UVA re-
portedly have teams. ‘“We’re not
that caliber yet,”’says Kearfolt, “but
we’re getting help from outsiders
who have played before, and we
hope to become competitive.”
