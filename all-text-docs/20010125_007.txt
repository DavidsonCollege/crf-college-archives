Trait ic stands out i in 1 year of otherwise r nec it

Many critics have named the year 2000 the
worst year of movies since the advent of the
talking picture in the 1930’s. Being only 22,
I can say with confidence that this is indeed
the worst year of films in my lifetime, but Ido
not have a prob-
lem trusting the
critics.

- You will notice
that the top three
films on my list
came out in De-
cember, a sad
thing indeed con-
sidering that one
of the movies will
not open in Char-
lotte until Febru-
ary 9!

These are the
films that im-

‘pressed me this
year. It was not
hard to come up
with a list of ten
great ones, but I
would be hard
pressed to name
twenty.

1. Traffic. It
begins in a desert
and ends ata base-
ball diamond, but
perhaps it should
have been the
other way
around—the de-
spair the movie leaves us with is profound.
Traffic is the only film this year that effec-
tively balances style and substance, intelli-
gence and entertainment.

When a movie has over 140 speaking roles
(in two languages), 3 distinct story lines, and
2 opposing visual styles, a confusing mess is
likely, buf Steven Soderbergh (who is one of
the best directors working today) balances
the ensemble so well, the film almost seems
intimate. The story is a disparaging and
brutally honest look at the drug trafficking
problem in North America, from the slums of
Tijuana to a posh neighborhood in Cincin-

‘nati, Ohio.

Some character portrayals seem a bit over-
the-top, but such minor quibbling aside, the

‘ film is nothing short of astonishing. Watch
for Benicio Del Toro’s earth-shattering per-
formance in two languages. He’ll win an
Oscar for it.-

2. You Can Count on Me. Here is a film
that leaves style at the door. Kenneth
Lonergan’ s directorial debut emphasizes char-
acter over plot and style—so much so that the
camera is nearly invisible; he places it in the
scene and lets his actors and script do the
work. He couldn’t have picked better a better
cast to interpret his writing, which is crisp,
smart, and more importantly, real.

Sammy (Laura Linney) and Terry (Mark
Ruffalo) are siblings whose parents were
killed in a car accident while they were chil-
dren. Years later, we find them estranged,
Sammy living in the same house with a child,
and Terry in a perpetual state of travel, going
in and out of jobs and jail. Their relationship
is tested through a homecoming visit from
Terry.

The best thing about the story is that the
characters are never one-dimensional; they
are always carefully observed; Sammy is not
always good, Terry is not always a screw-up.
While the film seems more like theater with
all the dialogue, the unsentimental and finely
tuned performances and writing make it bet-
ter. than the most technically proficient and
innovative movies. :

3. Wo Hu Zang Long (Crouching Tiger,

Hidden Dragon): Few movies stir an audi-
ence to applause, but this one got cheers no
less than five times at the screening I at-
tended. It is impossible not to stir. with

excitement during the gravity ignoring and
hyper-kinetically choreographed kung-fu ac-
tion sequences, which make The Matrix look
like child’s play.

Chow Yun-Fat
and Michelle
Yeoh add dra-
matic force while
Ziyi Zhang pro-
vides energy and
some comedy to
this tale of lost
love, ill-fated
love, andasword.
Each character is
vital and multi-
faceted, but the
reason this film
ultimately suc-
ceeds far beyond
expectations is its
director, Ang
Lee, who has
made a string of
great English-
speaking films
(Sense and Sen-
sibility, The Ice
Storm). His re-
turn to Chinese
cinema is mind-

. blowing—each
scene leaves you
breathlessly an-
ticipating the
next one, and that

makes great entertainment.

4. Chuck and Buck. It is probably one of
the most uncomfortable films ever made to sit
through, but that’s what this material lends
itself to. Chuck and Buck grew up together,
but Chuck moved away at eleven, leaving
Buck alone. Some disturbing things hap-
pened in their childhood causing Buck to stay
in the mindset of an eleven year-old into his
adult years. When his mother dies, Buck
moves to Los Angeles and latches on to
Chuck and basically stalks him.

Shot on digital film and mostly handheld,
the look of the film is very real—almost like
a documentary, and those visuals exponen-
tially increase the discomfort we feel for all
the characters involved. A brilliantly con-
ceived climax and dénouement leave us with
more questions than answers, but we thrive
on challenges, right? (Not for all tastes)

5. Almost Famous. Cameron Crowe makes
great movies, but he takes his time. He has
directed four films in eleven years, and this is
his second-best effort after the landmark ro-
mantic comedy Say Anything. It is semi-
autobiographical, recounting his chance in-
vitation to write a column for Rolling Stone
Magazine on a rock band.

The movie is filled with small scenes and
moments of purity and sublimity, like when
he listens to The Who for the first time, or
when his mother welcomes him home. Billy
Crudup and Frances McDormand are won-

derful, but Kate Hudson is the real knockout ©

here.

6. Requiem for a Dream. Less a film and
more the personification of addiction, Darren
Aronofsky’s second film is a nice counterpart
to Traffic. The plot is basically non-existent
as we watch four connected characters fall
slave to drugs. Jennifer Connelly, who is not
always the best actress, does a fine job along-
side Jared Leto, but Ellen Burstyn’s brave
and unbelievable performance as a diet-pill
addict is mesmerizing. This should be re-
quired viewing for ninth-graders; D.A.R.E.
take note. (Rated NC-17 for scenes of devi-
ant sexual activity and prolonged drug-use)

7. Dancer in the Dark, It has its problems.

Some scenes are really unbelievable, wire
moments a bit too earnest, but the movie IS a
musical, so we should expect some implausi-
bility and saccharine. Bjérk plays an immi-
grant with an eye disease who works night
and day to ensure her son can have an opera-
tion to keep him from the same fate.

The film is digital, giving it a grainy,
washed-out, and urgent, feeling. Lars Von
Trier employs jump cuts as his main stylistic
idea, but he switches style completely when
staging the mu-
sical numbers.
They are crisp,
colorful, and up-
lifting, adding
much needed re-
lief from the very Fg
grim story. @
Bjork’s perfor-
mance is the best
of the year, but
she_ probably
will not be rec-
ognized by the
traditionally |

conservative You Can Count on Me was one of the top
films of 2000. Shown are Mark Ruffalo and

academy.

8. Wonder Rory Culkin.

Boys. Curtis Hanson’s LA Confidential is
one of the best films ever made—a throw
back to the days of Roman Polanski’s bril-
liant Chinatown, and a time when characters
and situations were complicated rather than
easy. Wonder Boys is a lesser achievement,
but its characters are unforgettable—smart,
insecure, and multi-dimensional.

Michael Douglas plays a writer struggling
to write a follow-up to his brilliant first novel.
His rough draft is over two-thousand pages
and there i is no end to writing in sight. It’s his
performance that drives the movie, and the
writing is as literary as screenwriting gets.

9. The Virgin Suicides. Sophia Coppola
directs Kirsten Dunst in this dreamlike world
of repressed sexuality. The scenes seem
ethereal, floating by without explanation or
the need for it—somehow they all connect for
acohesive and very interesting whole. If only
because it raises endless questions and makes
the viewer sit in bewilderment, The Virgin
Suicides should be seen.

10. Rang-e Khoda (The Color of Para-
dise). The most profoundly sad movie on my
list is also the most beautiful. The story is
deceptively simple, and the acting amazing.
Iranian and in Farsi with English subtitles,

young ens il blin
struggle daily because his v
ahelpless burden. The imagery and symbol-
ism are rich and the dialogue sparse but
poignant. The film gives more insight into
the life and challenges that a blind person
faces than any movie I have seen, and little
Mohsen Ramezani is one of the great child
actors.

The worst:

1. Hollow Man. Insulting, disgusting, and
» worst of all,
| maddeningly
| boring, Hollow
_ Man marks a
new low in the
horror genre.
This is worse
than the latest
| Friday the 13"
# installment, be-
cause it was
marketed as a
quality film.
Utter dreck,
and the worst of
the year.

2. Autumn in
New York. The
best part of the movie (Warning: major spoiler)
is watching Winona Ryder die slowly in a
hospital. Painfully slow, stylistically inept,
and full of logic holes, the story is not fit for
a Lifetime made-for-cable movie.

3. What Lies Beneath. The movie has a
terrific opening hour. Too bad it turns out to
be a major red herring and completely useless
to the story. The last hour-and-a-half is a
mess of plot, and the ending is just laughable,
ugly, and insipid. It might have some good
scares, but the fact that Harrison Ford and
Michelle Pfeiffer signed on for this movie is
shameful.

4. The Patriot. Braveheart in America,
and all we get is one good scene in two-and-
a- half hours. Mel Gibson is better than this
garbage. Unlike You Can Count on Me or
Wonder Boys, characters are one-dimensional;
Englishmen are depicted as the scum of the
earth with absolutely no redeeming qualities.
Unforgivable.

5. The Blair Witch Project 2: Book of
Shadows. The movie makes absolutely no
sense, and is a disgusting combination of
gore, sex, and drugs—the absence of which
made the original work so well.
