The outlook’ for Gary An-
drew’s cross-country teams this
year is one of improvement and
optimism. According to Assistant
Coach Greg Forman, both the
women and the men should finish
higher in the conference stand-
ings. The majority of the men
from last season are coming back,
yet the team is still young. Robert
Cornish, the team captain, heads a
group of sixteen runners consist-
ing of two seniors, six juniors,
two sophomores, and four
freshmen. The frontrunners are
projected to be Cornish, Jay
Clugston, William Breidenstine,
Chris Fisher and William
Hartman. Two freshmen, Louis

Mattison and Brian Healey, have,

been impressive and should be in-
fluential as well in the growth of
the team. The coaches are expect-

ing a better standing than last‘

year’s — possibly even as high as
fifth. The conference leaders they
will be gunning for appear to be

East Tennessee, Marshall, and
Appalachian State, but this early
in the season it is hard to tell.
Since cross-country is such a
short’ season, from mid-Sep-
tember to mid-November, the —
runners have usually trained over
the latter course of the summer.
Coach Andrew therefore puts the
team through quality workouts to
fine-tune their muscles in prepara-

tion for the final stretch of the sea- —

son. Quality practices consist of
running distances of seven or
eight miles at a quick pace or
doing fart-leg runs which involve
a lot of surging. The runners gen-
erally average fifty-five to sixty
miles a week and rarely run over
twelve miles in one day. Their
races, generally on Saturdays, are ©
eight kilometers. When you at-
tend the two all-important meets
here at Davidson, the Davidson
Open on September 19th and the
Conference Championship on Oc-
tober 31st, support our runners
and yell them onward.

Sports Trivia Nationwide, Todd
Donoho, we have decided to inau-

This week’s Athlete of the Week
is senior soccer goalkeeper Jim
Kelly. In early Wildcat action this
season, Kelly has recorded 3 shut-
outs and was named most valuable
player of the WSOC soccer tour-
nament last weekend. After mis-
sing all of last year with an ankle
injury, Jim seems to have reco-
vered the form which gained him
all-conference honors in 1985.
Congratulations, Jim. Nomina-

the football glory boys could
strike every year.

2. “Fhe Boz” — although he
really doesn’t even deserve print,
the Boz needs to take a hike for his
taunting of John Elway, as well as
for his desire to make everyone in
football accept his standards.

3. George Steinbrenner (with
apologies to his nephew, Mr
Kamm) — had he not messed
with Lou Piniella and the on-field
workings of.the Yankees, they
probably would still be in the race

instead of falling.
