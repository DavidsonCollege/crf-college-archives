Todd Joins Select Assembly
Of Nostalgic Former Editors

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Feature Writer
How does it feel to be
former editor of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN? Only a few
men in history can answer
that question. John Todd,
the most recent initiate to
that select group, talked
about it as he reminisced
about his year as leader of
“The Voice of the Davidson
Student Body.”

“A lot of people have asked
me if I would do it again,” Todd
said. ‘‘I guess I would. I guess

I've accomplished a little. There
are a lot of things I’d do just
the same as I did: others, I've
learned by experience, I'd like
to change.”

His biggest complaint about
the job was the lack of partici-
pation and sympathy with the
problems of putting out a news-
paper by students not on the
staff.

He remarked, “I think the
students should realize it is the
paper of the students and _ its

eir place to make suggestions
to the staff about material. It’s

tough to sit around and dig up
everything that goes on around
here.”

Student interest in actual work
on THE DAVIDSONIAN staff
has been high, however, accord-
ing to Todd. There have been
over 70 people contributing to
putting out the paper over the
past year.

“T don't think that that many
people would take part if they
didn’t think i¢ was worthwhile,”
Todd noted. Largely because of
this enthusiasm on the part of
some, the Davidson publication
outstrips most newspapers of
comparably-sized schools

both size and quality.

One of the advantages of a
good newspaper is the opportuni-
ty it presents for journalistic
experience, he claimed. ‘‘Stu-
dents on the staff don't seem to
realize the potential of a jour-
nalistic career just because we
don't have a journalism depart-
ment.”’

He pointed out that many
Davidson graduates have done
well in journalism, including the
writer of this week’s Time cover
story.

sense a mandate by the students
to run the paper by his own ex-
perience and opinion. This meth-
od of selection is one of the real
strong points of the Davidson
system he said.

the paper.”

In summing up the year the
editor emeritus concluded, ‘‘We
haven't tried to push any issue.
any terrific campaign. We have
tried to interpret the issues as
they come up and comment on
the issues as we see them.”

HOUSE OF FAMOUS BRANDS

Our 54th Year Mooresville, N. C.

By ED EMBREE
Davidsonion Feature Writer

Dr. Frontis Johnston, dean
of the faculty, spoke at the
Sigma Nu house last night
and had some hopeful words
about the Davidson curric-
ulum as well as the role of

S]a liberal arts college such

as Davidson.

Johston stated that the pro-
posal for pre-Christmas exams

i \has been shelved by the facul-

ty while further and possibly
more drastic plans are under
study.

The possibility of a tri-mester
system will certainly be inciud-
ed in the discussions said Dr.
Johnston. Such a system would

his own example Sound of Mu-
sic.

Mekas was born in Lithuania
and was a poet there for some
years before coming to New
York City.

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE

He was denied entrance to
Israel and Egypt after he decid-
ed to leave Lithuania to take
up film making. Films were
“the universal language through
which I could reach all men,”
Mekas decided.

Talking about his own work,
Mekas said he was dissatisfied
with all his films, including The
Brig, except for a personal film
diary he has been working on
for a year.

He has carried a camera with
him all this time and has taken
shots of everything that inter-
ests him.

LOCAL FILMING

Some of this, such as manual
laborers on the soccer field and
pool balls falling into pockets,
was filmed here at Davidson.

This diary, called Notebook
1965, will be finished and edited
this summer.

Mekas said that he had noth-
ing kind to say about the recent
Academy Awards. ‘Hitchcock's
Marnie was the last acceptable
film to come out of Hollywood.”

“A film is only one small
dent, The medium of cinema is
breaking out and taking over
and is going blindly and by it-
self. Where to? Nobody knows.

“I’m glad about both, that it
is going somewhere and that no-
body knows where.”

include drastic curriculum and
schedule changes so that the stu-
dent would be required to take
only three courses at a time.
OTHER SCHOOLS

Dean Johnston is presently re-
viewing the curriculum and
schedules of other colleges and
plans to make a detailed study
of various systems this summer
and present a plan to the fac-
ulty in the fall.

On the subject of a tri-mester
system Dr. Johnston was asked
about the possibility of running
summer school as a_ separate

William Lee of the Duke
Power Company in Charlotte will
be the speaker at the ODK tap-
ping. in chapel next Thursday.

Those to be tapped were select-
ed during chapel period on Wed-
nesday and Friday of this week.

Selection is on the basis of
outstanding leadership in two
of several areas of academic
life, such as scholarship, ath-
letics, student government, so-

ROTC Blood Drive

The Red Cross Bloodmobile

The campaign, sponsored by
the ROTC Department and the
Interfraternity Council, will be
trying to put Davidson first in
participating colleges in. the
Carolinas.

“During. the past year we
were second by only a few pints,
a ROTC spokesman said. ‘‘With
not to much trouble we can get
the trophy back again.”

He did mention that Cham- mg.

IMPROVED PREPARATION

Outside of schedule changes, -
the curriculum also needs reval-
uation in light of modern needs
and improved high school prep- - ¢
aration of incoming students.

Dr. Johnston admitted that,
while certain courses may no
longer need to be required, at
least in their present form, oth-
er requirements may need to be
added because of the increased
importance of some academic
disciplines.

He also stated that because of
improved. high school curricu-
lums, many freshmen are mere-
ly repeating courses when they
come to Davidson. The advanc-
ed placement program, begun
only three or four years ago,
may have to be expanded or cer-
tain courses may need chang-
ing.

Because of the ‘‘explosion of
