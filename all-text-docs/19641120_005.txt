Wildcats Visit Wofford"

THE DAVIDSONIAN

For Final Football Tilt

By SAM BOYTE
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson's Wildcats com-
plete their football season
tomorrow night with an 8
p.m. game against: Wofford
on the Terriers’ home field
in Spartanburg, S. C.

The ’Cats will bring a 3-5 re-
cord into the game which will
see the Terriers try to even
their record at 5-5.

Davidson assistant coach Tom
Stevens, who saw Wofford lose
a close (22-14) game to the
University of Tampa last week,
observed, “They go for the ex-
plosive game. They can throw
long, deep passes. If they get
any daylight, those backs are
gone.”

Terrier halfback Bill Lane is
one of the runners to watch.
In one of his best games, Lane
ran for a 65-yard touchdown
and picked up 148 yards in 19
carries. Lane is also chief
punter for Wofford.

Coach Bill Dole noted, “They
can go for the bomb, the really
long pass.”

They -used this tactic against
Tampa to score their second
touchdown. Quarterback War-
ren Whittaker connected with
end Paul Infinger for a 39-yard
play in the final quarter.

At the other end Wofford has
John Housel, 64, 230-pound co-
captain of the Terriers. Housel
grabbed three passes last week
as well as being a defensive
stand-out.

Stevens is impressed with the
Terriers’ quarterback. “He is

real fast and runs options
well,” he notes.

It was a last minute lateral
from Whittaker that set up
Lane's 65-yard run. He also ac-
counted for 144 yards of pass-
ing.

“Wofford runs 2 different
kind of offense from any that
we've faced be'ore,” noted Stev-
ens. “They run a sort of split-
T. using a lot of dives and
options off the dive. They de-
pend more on speed than de-
ception. They don't do any-
thing fancy except the dive op-
tions. They just run straight
at you. They have good speed
in the backfield"

“Their defense seems to be
better than last year. They have
vetter movement.” One factor
in the improved defense is the
size of their Jine which aver.
ages between 215 and 220
pounds,

The team which center Will
Jackson and quarterback Steve.
Heckard, newly-elected season
captains, lead onto the field
will be running on injured
legs.

“Our boys got pretty well
beat up in the last game,” Ia-
mented Dole. “It’s matter of
the season catching up with
us. We've played — straight
through without a break. It
piles up after a while.”

As a result, several 'Cats are
out of contact work in this
week's practice. Heckard, John-
ny Walker, Dave Hendricks, and
Pat Fisher were in the process
of recuperating this week. Jim
Rollins and Phil Hightower also

TICKET TROUBLES

Marked improvement has been made this year in
the student basketball ticket situation at the Charlotte
Coliseum.

Last year’s end parquet seats have been replaced
by circle, mezzanine, and balcony seats at the side of
the court.

The Charlotte Invitational Tournament tickets are
available this year at half price, whereas last year they
were sold at regular admission cost.

Regardless of what complaints have been made
about our seating arrangements this year, I am convinced
that we have almost the best possible seats available,
considering the complications made by the ticket de-
mands from faculty, contributing alumni, and the general
public.

But all is not good. Certain criticisms have not
been refuted. Certain questions have not been answer-
ed. Certain things still ought to be changed. .

Why must we pay for any home games? The athle-
tic office says that we are guaranteed ten free games a
year. This year we are getting just that. A minimum
number of ten free games is a good thing, but why must
we also use it as a maximum? .

All the games for which we pay half price this year
are played during Christmas holidays. So what? If we
played some of these games at Davidson during the
holidays, we could be admitted free. But by moving
these games to Charlotte somehow this is changed.

I'm all for playing in Charlotte. Whether students
pay or not, more money is made; more publicity is
gained, and more people enjoy the games. There is
just no logical reason why we should pay our money to
‘see our team play in our home games; be they in Char-
lotte or Davidson; be they ten or fifteen a year.

To add insult to injury, someone has dreamed up
the catchy little term “complimentary tickets”. That is
to say the games which we are rightfully entitled to see
by all admissions (including the athletic office's) are
“compliments” of some mystic unknown force, who ben-
evoluently bestows upon us free tickets.

These are complimentry tickets all right. Compli-
ments of the $100 General Fee that we each pay every
year. Even the College catalogue admits this. It says
the General Fee cost “includes Health and Physical
Education and Student Activities” for the year.

Another criticism which has been made is about
date tickets. No one will argue that our Coliseum
games are not home games. Since this is the case, why
don’t we get date tickets to these games for the same
price as other home games (in Davidson)?

Instead of paying the usual $1.50 for a date ticket,
under the present Coliseum ticket system we pay at
least $2.00 and maybe more, depending on where in the
student section we sit. Since the student section en-
compasses different priced seats, date tickets are differ-
ent priced.

Granted the college need not be concerned with
looking out for the interests of dates, or for that mat-
ter anyone who doesn’t attend the school. But cheaper
date tickets is not a favor to the dates. Considering that
any Davidson gentleman who manages to get a date
will undoubtedly be paying her way, I think date ticket

rices are a clear-cut concern of the students and, there-
ore, the college.

it sppeare everything hinges on money. The criti-
cisms that have just been reflected would cut down on
the college “take” from the coliseum games. Still they
deserve consideration.

Substantial improvement has been made on one as-
pect of our criticisms of last year. But digression has
resulted in another.

FOOTBALL NOTES

After resetting his school record for most yards
gained in one game by piling up 176 against Lafayette,
Steve Smith has taken over the rushing lead in the
Southern Conference. He has a season total of 686
yards.

Steve Heckerd is fourth in passing with 55 com-

letions in 108 attempts for 643 yards. He ranks fifth
fn total offense with 701 yards.

and avoid contact.

If these boys hold together,
Davidson will be starting its

will be ready to spell Walker,
and Jake Jacobsen will be in
for Heckard.

since. Line blocking has improv
ed. The offensive line has done

a real good job. Woody Hill
has helped tremendously since
we moved him from defense.

“The halfbacks have been
blocking well This blocking has
been the’ key to our improve-
ment. Our total picture has im-
proved defensively and in offen-
sive rushing.”

Davidson has a 21-5-1 record
against Wofford, but this game
promises to be no push-over.
Coach Stevens pointed out,
“We'll have to play a real good
game to beat them.”

"Cats Top Lafayette;
Smith Resets Record

By PAUL MARION
Davidsonian Sports Writer
Davidson downed the visiting Lafayette Leopards
31-12 last Saturday afternoon at Richardson Field to

push the season record to

3-5.

The Wildcats equaled the hot weather with a hot
offense that produced 438 yards, their best showing
of the season. Behind the running of halfback Steve
Smith, who broke his. own Davidson single game.
rushing record by compiling 176 yards, and power-

fullback Dave Hendricks,

the Cats scored the first

two times they had possession and put the game on
ice with a 17-0 halftime lead.

Coach Dole, who has “been pleased with the
team’s performance since the Richmond game,”
singled out defensive tackle Ed Childs and lineback-
er Dick Short for outstanding performances.

Dole was not surprised by the powerful passing
attack of Lafayette quarterbacks George Hossenlopp
and Gary Marshall, but praised the rushing power of

the defensive line.

He revealed that the defensive

backs were often allowing short passes in order to

guard against the bomb.

After receiving the opening kickoff the Black and
Red moved to the Leopard 33 and Jim Terry began

the scoring with a field goal. The next time they
had the football, the Cats moved ta the enemy’s 44.
From here quarterback Steve Heckard, who has been
elected permanent team captain along with center
Will Jackson, rolled around left end and raced down

the sideline to paydirt.

_ In the second quarter,
lowed heavy blocking around left end and sped 19
yards to his first score of the day. The teams re-
fired at the half with Davidson holding a command-

ing 17-0 lead.

The second half brought a barrage of passes by
the Lafayette offense, which finally accumulated 306
yards through the air. However, the Wildcats drew
first blood on Smith's second T.D. of the game, a
24-yard sprint around right end.

After a Lafayette score, sophomore halfback Mick-
ey Andrews capped his best showing of the season
by slashing through a hole in the right side of the
Davidson's line and outrunning the Leopard second-
ary for a 59-yard touchdown. A final visitors’ score

RECORD BREAKER BRAKEL

“Best Lineman We've Ever Had”

Jan, called by Fogleman the
“best lineman we've ever had
in my time,” has used his su-
perb conditioning to best ad-
vantage, becoming the leading

. scorer on this year’s team and

‘ the holder of the Davidson
soccer record of most goals
scored during one season.

Prior to the season's finale

’ against Emory today, Jan had
booted 26 goals, smashing the
, old record of 17.

A menber of the Al-South
soccer team last year, Jan scor-
ed 11 goals as a halfback last
year, whereas this year’s half-
backs have accumulated a total
of one.

Jan started playing soccer,
the national sport of the Neth-
erlands, at the. age of six, and
came to the United States sev-
en years ago. He came to

Brakel Sets Record
For Soccer Scoring

i How can a student who is so quiet-spoken and shy
be one of the fiercest competitors at Davidson? Jan
Brakel, who most of the time looks like anything but a
soccer player, is one of the best soccer players in the
South, according to Coach Harry Fogleman.

soccer was played here, but be-
came a standout even in his
sophomore season.

Teammates Lee Fanning and
Louis Foss speak of Jan’s abil-
ity with respect. Fanning com-
mented, “Jan loves to play soc-
cer. He controls the ball very
well, and can place his shots.”

Foss declared, ‘Jan is a lead-
er in the sense that if you
let down, he won't. He'll al-
most come over and play your
position.”

Coach Fogleman withheld no
praise of his pupil, “My only
problem is that he's so good.
He's kicked our penalty kicks
for the past two years and
has only missed one shot. He’s
a tremendous competitor and
works to win; he is superbly
conditioned and always hustles.
You just can't ask for more
than that.”
