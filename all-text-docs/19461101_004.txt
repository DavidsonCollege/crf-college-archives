November 1, 1946

Davidson Midgets
Get First Victories

Some three dozen very young
lads with athletic ability—or at
least a lot of energy — from the
towns of Huntersville, Davidson,
Cornelius, and Charlotte have been
organized into football teams,
which form a midget league. Quite
a few Davidson boys are dedicating
their time and efforts to coach
these boys and to see that those
interested are encouraged to play
football as it should be played, and
not in the rough-house manner
usually associated with youngsters.

The student coaches do not have
to contend with some of the prob-
lems that face coaches of teams
that have as their players boys
that are slightly older.

Win Over Huntersville

In the first “conference” game,
which played last week
tween the wee ones, the powerful

spirited Huntersville team, 19-0.
The victors, coached by Harry Tem-
ple Steve Wilkinson, were
sparked to their triumph by Over-
left end, Washam, the
fullback. The Huntersville young:
sters, coached’ by “Dusty” and’ Bill
Smith, put up a good battle, but
their defense was just not quite

Cornelius V="Huntersvitle-——
In the second game, last Friday,

the high spirited Huntersville team, |

greatly hampered by the lack of
substitutes, met in a closely con-
tested game-—with the flashy but
highly undeveloped Cornelius team.
The two threats of the Huntersville
Eagles were staved off by Cor-
nelius who returned with some good
kicks by Foote Robinette. Toward
the end of the first half, Bob Cor-
rell skirted the right end of the
Eagles’ line and ran 65 yards for
the first touchdown of the game,
after two attempts on the center
by his team-had failed. Held by
John Ed Whitlow and kicked by
Foote Robinette, the ball went low.

In the second half tHe offensive
was taken over by Huntersville,
who, however, was unable,to threat-
en because of the fast charging
center of the Cornelius line. The
shifty backs of the Eagles, sparked
by Sam Cross, were finally able to
invade the Cornelius territory to
the one-yard line. Here, in a bril-
liant goal line stand, the Cornelius
team held Huntersville for four
downs and took over on the one-
foot line. As the last
elapsed, Bob Correll attempted a
pass, which was intercepted by the
Eagles. In the last play of the
game, Sam Cross went through a
beautiful hole at right tackle, open-
ed by the forward wall of the
Fagles, to tie the score. Since the
attempt for the extra point failed,
great rivalry expected in the
future between the two teams.

KAPPA ALPHA

First, Sigma Chapter wishes to
welcome the alumni to Davidson
and it especially extends a hearty
hand to all KA alumni. We trust
that this will be the most success-
ful Homecoming in Davidson’s his-
tory.

If you listened hard enough last
week end, you could hear the “calm
before the storm” at the KA house.
All eyes, and thoughts are on the
big, long-awaited event — Home-
coming. In case you have wonder-
ed who that “chicken with his head
cut off” is, let us now relieve you
of all suspicion. It is only Brother
Mac Jeffries, who, Pan-Hel
Prexy, has had a terrific job plan-
ning and executing the dance plans.
Our hats are off to Mac and all
the council.

Brother Cunningham, known by
various intimate names, but com-
monly called “Chuck,” had hectic
Saturday P. M. “Operatif Coen-
verse” was on the slate, but be-
cause of the weather he made a
forced landing at Gaffney, which
happens to be the home of Lime-
stone College. ’Nuff said.

One Queens’ girl was enough to
make solemn, stately Pledge Glas-
gow say that he got “a tremendous
charge” (rated at 10,000 volts, DC).

of B.J.B. (spelled backwards),

But the biggest safari of the
week end was led by Brother Wilkes
Macanlay. In company with Broth-
ers Harris, Harden, and ‘Richard-
son, all riding “Naomi,” he was
last seen heading for the. wilds of
Seneca, S. C. Coincidentally eight
(count ’em) girls from Q. C. also
made a similar trip. With 2 to 1

odds, the fellows must think the
war is still on.

The Tennessee contingent seems
to love “them that hills”, Making
the trip to Bristol were Jack and
Bill Faucette, Dick Easley, and
Harry Bachman.

We haven’t forgotten Salem Day
—or have we? A fair share of the
beauties seemed to go KA, but not
all were satisfied. Perhaps the
most flashy trio of the day consist-
ed of Tim Payne, Bird Fowle, and
John Quincey Adams. Tim reports
a verbal encounter with date over
the respective merits of Davidson
and Princeton,

Lengthiest journey of the period
was that of Brother Jack Payne.
He flew, by air mail, to New York,
for an ad interim meeting of the
United Christian Youth Move-
ment.

Brother Art Lindsay was up to
Shelby and Brothers Sam Ervin and
Bill Carter rode back to Morgan-
ton with the high school band.

Ruling the football roost was a
pleasant feeling. At least it was
at the time this goes to press. But
some of the other mighty teams of
the nation have been upset unex-
pectedly, and its rumors are that
the S. A. E.s are gunning for us.
Fire away, we’re wearing the lat-
est in double-breasted armor plat-
