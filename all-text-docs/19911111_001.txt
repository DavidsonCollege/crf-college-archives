Committee Formed to Deal With Campus Tensions

By Kevin Miller

Richard Terry, Chuck Hasty,
Brenda Tapia, Ruth Pittard and
John Eaves, members of the Stu-
dent’s Affairs Staff, decided last
week to organize an informal
committee to discuss the unusu-
ally high amount of tension that
has generated among various
groups of students throughout the
past four weeks.

Concern over heated debates
about the appropriateness of many

controversial fraternity flyers, the
possibility of having a F.L.A.G.
organization on campus and the
apparent rise in racism on campus
are some of the conflicts that
brought this group together.

The group was not formed,
according to Terry, because of a
large amount of reported viola-
tions of the Code of Responsibil-
ity, or because of many unhappy
students preparing to leave
Davidson. If that were true, he

Assistant Library
Director Beaty to
RetireAt End of Year

By Tom Price

Dr. Mary Beaty, the assistant
director of the E:H. Little Library
and the head of the reference de-
partment, has decided to retire at
the close of this academic year.
She has worked at Davidson since
1973, when she came from the
University of Richmond.

Dr. LelandPark, the director of
the library, said, “Mary’s contri-
bution to this Library and to this
College have been substantial and
lasting ones. We wish her the best
and give her our thanks.”

Beaty grew up in Davidson
and has “always loved it.” During
the 1960’s, Beaty taught at the
University of Richmond, whereshe
was Chairperson of the Depart-
ment of Ancient Languages. In
1973, Beaty decided to return to
Davidson. In addition to her work
in the library, she has periodically

taught classes in Latin and in the

Humanities program.

During her. retirement, Beaty

willexplore interests such as paint-
ing, music, reading, and perhaps
do some volunteer work. Beaty

said that she is not exactly sure
what she will do, but simply wants
“more free time.”

Beaty may also continue writ-
ing during her retirement. During
her time at Davidson she has writ-
ten three works concerning the
Davidson community. These in-
clude Davidson: A History of the
Town from 1835-1973 (1979), A
History of Davidson College
(1988), and A History of the
Davidson. College Rresonenen
Church (1987).

When asked whatshe will miss
most about her daily work, Beaty
didn’ thesitate to say, ‘The people.”
Beaty says she will miss fellow
workers, faculty, and students. She
said that over the years Davidson
has provided “wonderful students
to work with.” She explained that
she has enjoyed not having a
“grading barrier” with students as
a librarian, and has cherished the
opportunity to help them.

Beaty has seen numerous
changes during her time at the

ROTC Blood Drive Nets 136

By Tom Koonce

The Red Cross and the ROTC
departmentheld their annual blood
drive at Davidson Friday. Jim
Leesch was the ROTC officer in
charge at the drive and Dave Har-
ding was the non-commisioned
officer in charge.

‘According to Leesch, the goal

for this year’s drive was 125 units
of blood. Friday’s total surpassed

this goal since 136 units were re-

ceived by the Red Cross,

The Red Cross said that 156 people
arrived to give blood and twenty
were deferred for various reasons.

There were 38 first-timedonorson —
Friday and 98 people who had—

given blood in the past.

The units of blood received
this year surpasses last years total
by 36 units. Leesch said that last
year’s drive was very hectic be-
cause it was held on the last day of

said, the administration would have
taken more direct action.

Instead, Terry said, a lot of the
tension has fallen under the age-
old issue of free speech (i.e. - the
flyers, the many opinion letters in
the Davidsonian): Therefore, the
administration did not want to in-
fringe on that inalienable right.

In an effort to bring these prob-
lems to the forefront, the group
sent out letters to all administra-
tors, teachers and other college

employees. They also placed an ad
in this week’s, Davidsonian ad-
dressed to students, inviting ev-
eryone to join in an informal open
forum about these problems.

Through this and future such
discussions of bigotry, the group
hopes that students and teachers
can find some solutions to these
problems, and that Davidson can
truly become the diverse college
that people believe it to be.

Terry emphasized, however,

that this forum may produce no
solution at all because this “ten-
sion” may be coming from the
close-quartered living conditions
of college and that it may be a
passing cycle of student life.

The group and Terry, though,
do not want to sit on their hands
and let the phase work its way out,
soa forum, he said, seems to be the
best way to work on the problems.
