Davidson hosts foreign performers

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Executive Editor

The Davidson College Artists
Series annually offers a set of prog-
rams designed to entertain the cul-
turally starved Davidson student.

The cumbersome name serves its
purpose aptly: these programs are
indeed put on by artist-performers.

The Artist Series for ’75-’76 has an
international flair with acts from
Mexico, Yugoslavia, France, and
England. The season begins October
14 with the Royal’ Shakespeare Com-
pany of London performing The
Hollow Crown.

Russell Kushigan, Assistant Direc-
tor of the College Union, described
this .season’s offerings by saying,
‘“There’s an international flavor about
the series this year. I guess that
seems strange for a bicentennial year,
but we just got the best programs
available to us.”

Much of the value of the Artists
Series lies in the fact that it is
entertainment one cannot get in
concentrated form anywhere else.
Union Vice President in charge of
Co-Curricular Activities, Pat Hudson
described the Artists Series as
“Entertainment in a cultural vein: It
should be something you won't be
able to see on TV or at a college
without an artists series. It should
offer a wide range of cultural offerings
unavailable except in this kind of
situation.

“Quite often members of fraterni-
ties and eating houses don’t need the
Union for popular entertainment like
bands or dances. The fraternities
serve that purpose. However, the
Artists series provides an outlet that
they can’t possibly get at a frat where
the emphasis is on daquari parties
and herding girls in from other
schools,’”’ continued Hudson.

The cultural nature of the Artists
Series is apparently appreciated by
Davidson students. The seats have
generally been filled in the past and

audience enjoyment has been good,
according to Union officials.

“These performances are definitely '
appreciated,’’ said Hudson. ‘‘The
most appealing part about the Artists
Series is that it is an entirely different
atmosphere from the other kinds of
enone. The audiences have
always been as attentive as they can
be.”

Union President Richard Wassen
suggested that. Davidson students

enjoy all type of entertainment. He
said, ‘‘Generally in our past experi-
ence, it has been the same people
attending the Artists Series as at-
tending the more popular events.

“Obviously people enjoy different
forms of entertainment and not just
one kind: The Artists Series is special
because it is a complement to the
classroom.”

If the students enjoy the perfor-
mance, the performers enjoy it as
least as much. Oftentimes a performer
will stay over in Davidson after his
show. This happened twice last year.
Both William Windom and Viveca
Lindfors remained two extra days to
conduct workshops and talk to stu-

“In all my working with performers
they have liked Davidson and the
Davidson audience very much,” said
Hudson. ‘‘Maybe not so much their
time on stage, but their lodging. We
really do it up and treat our guests
like kings. They like it,’’ said
Hudson.

Wassen added, ‘‘The entertainers
at Davidson find the audiences recep-
tive and understanding. The clearest
indication that the performers are
being received well and, consequent-
ly, if they are enjoying it is if a large
audience turns up.”

The ’75-’'76 season includes the
Royal Shakespeare Company in The
Hollow Crown on October 14, the
National Dance Company of Mexico
in ‘Fiesta Folklorico’ on January 21,
the Ars Antiqua de Paris on. March
19, and the Brahko Krsmanovich
Chorus on March 29.

The Hollow Crown is not a Shake-
spearian play, but it contains much
information and action from the time
of Shakespeare. Much of the script of

this dramatic presentation has been

gleaned from the writings and record-

ed histories of the English monarchs.
Included in the work is Queen
Victoria’s message to Albert on their
wedding day and a poignant appeal
for life from Anne Boleyn to Henry

VIII. ;
The Royal Shakespeare Company is

perhaps the best known and most
widely traveled theatre group in the
world. The group was formed in 1875
to build the Shakespeare Memorial
Theatre. The RSC comes to Davidson
as part of its centennial tour. The
company numbers over 500 people
and includes Davidson graduate Mike
Gwilym.

“The Artists Series should stimu-
late a lot of interest in the Charlotte
area. Of course our priorities are to
the students here who have already
paid for their tickets in the activities
fee, but we are planning to invite
people who are interested from out-
side the college. I urge students
interested in this series to get their

tickets early,’’ said Hudson.
