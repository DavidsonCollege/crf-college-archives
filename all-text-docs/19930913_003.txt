After brief discussion, College decides to
continue traditional, accepted tenure policy

By Mandy Curtis

After the Civil War, a profes-
sor was fired from Davidson be-
cause he said he was going to vote
for Ulysses S. Grant in the next
election. At that time, tenure was
nota formal arrangement between
the college and the faculty as it is
today.

Tenure is a system that was
institutionalized in the late '5Os
andearly ‘60s. Itis asystem within
colleges and universities that pro-
tects the employment of profes-
sors after a interim period at the
school. After that time a professor
can only be dismissed based on
scholarly incompetence or immoral
conduct.

Across the nation, tenure has
been up for examination and reas-

sessment in recent years. Accord-
ing to Dr. Alexander McKelway,
Davidson’s faculty representatives,
including Dr. Randy Nelson, Dr.
Ben Klein, and McKelway, took
part in discussing the concept of
tenure with the Educational Com-
mittee of the Trustees on Septem-
ber 7.

The committee is interested in
thedetails regarding promotion and

tenure. McKelway says that there

is nothing unusual about the inter-:

est; discussion did not arise due to
any movement to change the-ten-
ure policy at the college.
According to McKelway, ten-
ure is a “legal, contractual agree-
ment between the faculty and the
institution” that still serves an im-
portant purpose at the college. The

system forces the school to under-
take “intensive and extensive in-

vestigations of the professors” on °

the faculty.

At Davidson the probationary
period is six years before a profes-
sor is brought up for tenure. Previ-
ous to the sixth year, the professor
is reviewed and evaluated; how-
ever, after that the administration
makes a decision whether or not a
professor will receive tenure.

The Faculty Tenure Review
Committee is in charge of the thor-
ough evaluation of the professor at
that time. The investigation as-
sesses the value of thé professor’s
teaching and research, as well as
one’s willingness to assist students
and interest in the community and
college. “Any perception of pro-
fessional weakness” can cause a
professor to be denied tenure, ac-
cording to McKelway.

After a professor receives ten-

’ ure, he or she is protected from

unjust dismissal. The system was
Started in the United States be-
cause at the time there was a ten-
dency for professionals to be dis-
missed due to political or moral
discrimination.

There are two major theoreti-
cal concerns about tenure, accord-
ing to McKelway. The first is
whether anyone should be guaran-
teed employment to the time of
retirement. The second question is
why only this one profession be

guaranteed employment when no
other is...

At Davidson, professors have
various incentives throughout their
career to continue working, re-
searching, and teaching to the best
of their abilities, says McKelway.
The salary scale and the promo-
tional system keep the professors
going; no one is ever “home free”
after receiving tenure.

According to McKelway, it

’ would be very difficult for aninsti-_

tution tosecurea good faculty with-
out the tenure policy. To
McKelway’s knowledge, there is
no school with a good reputation
that has not adopted or that has
abandoned the tenure system in
the United States.

"There will always be the few
instances where a faculty member
is no longer fulfilling the expecta-
tions of the institution prior to be-
ing tenured. But, according to
McKelway, there is always a price
to be paid for having any system,
evena valuable system like tenure.

Davidson Outdoors
dives into action

By Court McBryde

Hang gliding, kayaking, raft-
ing, backpacking, cycling, androck
climbing are some of the activities
Davidson Outdoors offers to
Davidson students, faculty, and
Staff.

Davidson Outdoors exists asa
program.
Davidson graduates Ed and Marlys
Daugherty are the directors of this

.program. Ed Daugherty founded

Davidson Outdoors as a senior at
Davidson in 1986 and this is the
couple’s second year as program
directors.

Davidson Outdoors’ fall
schedule consists of a variety of
ten trips during weekends of Sep-
tember, October, and November.
The trips range from white water

backpacking at Mount Rogers,
mountain biking in the Pisgah Na-
tional Forest, to rock climbing at
Crowder’s Mountain.

Davidson Outdoors provides
equipment, transportation, and
meals for all trips and the average
cost of a trip is $13.

Inadditionto the regular week- _

end excursions, Davidson Out-
doors offers three fall break trips
and two Christmas vacation trips
for reasonable prices.

During fall break, October 15-
19, Davidson Outdoors sponsors a
trip to hang gliding flight school
on the Outer Banks of North Caro-
lina.

The Daugherty’s will be teach-
ing a kayaking clinic in the Great
Smokey Mountains on Lake
Fontana and the Tuckaseegee and
Nantahala rivers. A white water
rafting trip on the New and Gauley
Rivers is available.

These trips are open to anyone
and cost $150.00 each, including
transportation, training and instruc-
tion, meals, camping, and equip-
ment. All trips are led by Davidson
students whom have undergone
training in wilderness and leader-
ship skills through Davidson Out-
doors.

The Christmas vacation trips
run about ten days. One trip is
canoeing in the Everglades, Janu-
ary 7-16, which costs $160.00. The
other Christmas journey is January
6-16, sailing on a 37 foot sailboat
on Florida’s Gulf Coast for
$320.00.

Senior Alexia Gregory is the
student head of Davidson Out-
doors. She planned the fall sched-
ule and wants students to become

exposed to the trips available.
Gregory says, “If people will try
the trips once they will love the
experience.”

The Daugherty’s feel this pro-
gram provides the opportunity for
people to spend time with friends
in a different setting.. But most
importantly, their goal is to make
sure Davidson Outdoors trips feel
like a student program.

The Daugherty’s want the trips
this year to run with a higher num-
ber of people. If students do not
like the trips available they should
make suggestions.

In addition to the wide range
of trips, Davidson Outdoors has a
climbing wall located in Johnston
Gym open Sunday to Thursday
from 7-9 p.m., and Wednesday

rolling clinics are offered in Baker
Sports Complex every Thursday
from 7-9 p.m. Both activities wel-
come anyone from the beginner to
the expert.

Davidson Outdoors also pro-
vides people with maps, trail in-
formation, and rents camping
equipment for those people adven-
turing off into the wilderness on
their own.

__ If anyone is interested in be-
coming a trip leader for Davidson
Outdoors, a Trip Leader Training
Course will be available to any
student during the spring semester
this year as a physical education
course which will count for a life-
time credit. From these trainees
the Daugherty’s will select stu-
dents leaders based on a particular
criterion.

Two faculty members, 66
freshmen, and 20 upperclassmen
trip leaders have already taken the
opportunity to venture on a
Davidson Outdoors experience by
participating on the Odyssey from
August 19-25

The 78 participants were split
into twelve crews and spent five
days paddling and hiking either
the Chattooga, French Broad, or
Nolichucky river trails. They ended
their expedition working on ser-
vice projects such as Habitat for
Humanity. Freshman, Chloe
Bracis says the best thing about the
Odyssey was being in the middle
of nowhere away from school.

Freshman Odyssey participant
Adam Ziegler sums up his experi-
ence in a journal entry, “If this
preview is any indication of the
general Davidson experience then
I am definitely in the right place.”
