Baker parking controversy: “It’s going to stay open.”

By Matrtuew Erricu
Assistant News Editor

Lee Sargent has raised the ire
of many students by asking them,
along with faculty and staff, to
move their cars from the Baker lot
on the nights of home basketball
games. Sargent threatened that if
students did not move their cars he
would turn the lot intoa stafflot. In
reality, Sargent does not have the
power to change the status of the
lot. Students have moved their
cars so the lot will not be closed off
to students.

In the January 26 letter,
Sargent cited “doubled” fan atten-
dance at basketball games as the
reason students have to move their
cars. He wrote, “On three occa-
sions, we have had significant num-
bers of fans, many of them paid
season ticket holders, walking in

the dark and through the traffic
from Concord Road to our games.”
In an interview Sargent said, “I
don’t feel good about older specta-
tors having to walk in bad weather
and the dark” to the games.

The difficulty, says Sargent,
is that on average 150 of the avail-
able 600 parking spaces are occu-
pied by faculty, students, and staff.
Of those 150 spaces, 50 to 70, says

. Sargent, are taken by students.

Sargent says that for an average
crowd of 3,500 spectators there
will be approximately 800 specta-
tors’ cars which need to be parked.
Therefore, Sargent considers the
150 spots taken by students, fac-

-ulty, and staff to be crucial on

game nights.

In the letter Sargent asked for
“good voluntary support” from the
students in removing their cars. If
Students’ failed to remove their

cars, he wrote, “Our alternative is
not a good one. We have permis-
sion to turn the Baker Lot into a
Staff Lot.” Student response was
very cooperative, says Sargent. All
but nine students had removed their
cars from the lot by five o’clock
before the Marshall game, and says
Sargent, “‘We called the nine stu-
dents who had forgotten, and they
were very cooperative” in moving
their cars.

Because students removed
their cars, Sargent does not believe
it will be necessary to turn the
Baker lot into a staff lot. Sargent
says, “I appreciate the responses of
most of the students.”

Although the students who
park in Baker removed their cars,
some are very upset about having
to do so. Reflecting this dissatis-
faction with the change in policy,
Independent Senator Jonathan Orr

sponsored a resolution at the SGA
meeting on Tuesday night which
“condemns the recent Athletic
Department decision to ban stu-
dents from Baker Sports Complex
parking on basketball game
nights.” The resolution was ap-
proved with only one abstention.
In an interview Orr said, “I
certainly sympathize with their [the
operators of Baker] problem ....
What bothers me is [that Sargent
said] if you don’t do this we will
ticket you or tow you.” Orr de-
scribed Sargent’s actions as
“heavy-handed.” He also said that
students park in Baker as a last
resort and was insulted that stu-
dents are being asked now to in-
convenience themselves further.
Orr says it was appropriate for
Sargent to ask students to move
their cars but not to force them to
. doso. He says, “Go ahead and call

them up if they are parked there.
But don’t ticket them ... This is
parking that has always been prom-
ised to students, and it’s not fair to
just yank it away.”

Sargent says he had no inten-
tion to ticket or tow students’ cars.
He wanted to rely on the students’
cooperation, but in fact he could
not ticket or tow students’ cars.

Norcould Sargent himself turn

' Baker intoa staff lot. According to

Director of Public Safety and Po-
lice Ray Thrower, only the Cam-
pus Police can authorize changing
the status of a parking lot. Says
Thrower, “Lee Sargent has no au-
thority over that lot.”

Thrower confirmed that Baker
is an open parking lot 24 hours a
day, and students are free to park
there anytime they wish, regard-

Stapleton Davidson Applications due Wed.

The Stapleton Davidson In-
ternship is a summer program en-
gineered to involve Davidson stu-
dents in urban service work in the
more troubled areas and social
agencies of Charlotte.

Interns will work in conjunc-
tion with the Office of the Chap-
lain and assigned churches in Char-
lotte.

The experience is intended to
provide, according to one partici-
pant, ‘‘a Christian perspective to
the service work and to allow the
intern a unique opportunity to ex-
plore the relationship between
Christian organizations and. their
social responsibilities and attitudes
toward society.”

Founded by George Donnell
Davidson, Jr., a 12-year trustee of
Davidson College, and his wife
Anne Stapleton Davidson, the in-
ternship was designed to provide a
valuable Christian service experi-
ence. Each intern will receive a
stipend of $2500 from the Stapleton
Davidson endowment.

Last summer’s interns worked
for a variety of social agencies.
Senior Elizabeth Fleming worked
with the Family Support Center,
an organization implemented for
the treatment and prevention of
child abuse. Fleming describes her
experience as rewarding and says,
“TJ learned a lot about myself and
the world around me; even more

importantly, now I see myself in
relation to the world and my social
responsibilities to those in need.”
Senior Meg Hines worked
with both Crisis Assistance Minis-
try as a counselor for those with
personal and financial crises and
Charlotte Emergency Housing as
the director of children’s activities
for the children of homeless fami-
lies currently residing there.
“People in inner-city Charlotte
taught me a lot about service and
faith,” says Hines. “This summer

Record 52 students
apply for tour guides

By Mec WoLrr
Staff writer

According to Admissions
Counselor Robert Marshall, when
recent tour guide positions were
offered, Davidson Ambassadors
were “only looking for a few people
to fill holes in a schedule that, for

the most part, was already full.”
Instead, the admissions office re-

ceived an unprecedented 52 appli-
cants, leading to a very competi-
tive selection process.

“This is really reflective of
how students perceive an impor-
tant service as part of Davidson
Ambassadors. Students enjoy as-
sociation and contact with prospec-
tive students — this seems to be
indicative of a desire to have a say
about who ultimately comes to
Davidson,” says Marshall.

“I don’t want anyone to feel
bad that they were not selected,”
says Marshall. The vacancies in
the schedule occurred when a few
tour guides from last semester
chose not to continue this semes-
ter.. Ten tour guides were ulti-
mately selected, with a few others

chosen as alternates to be trained

for large school group tours ani
‘Decision Davidson. 9 550

Decision Davidson will occur
on Saturday, April 8. Marshall and
Admissions Counselor Sally Stone
are working closely with the new
presidents of Davidson Ambassa-
dors, Anne Miller and Missy
Graves.

The Admissions Office is ex-
pecting close to 200 students to
attend and will need volunteers for
overnight hosting and taking pro-
spective students to classes.
