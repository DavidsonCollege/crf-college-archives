DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER |

February 1, 2006

Union Café. Vice President
Jeffrey Morrison was fired this
past Thursday after an internal
audit revealed that he had bilked
the popular student eatery out of
nearly $12.5 million in
Davidson College Bonus Bucks.

Morrison embezzled the col-
lege-created currency in the
forms of corporate write-offs,
accounting cover-ups, and lav-
ish sandwich orders.

“The extent to which he stole
from the Union Café is simply
unprecedented,” said Campus
Safety Officer Jill Whitley, head
of the Davidson College Fraud
unit. “We really don’t even
know how much he has been
taking, or for how long, since
Bonus Bucks don’t roll over
between academic years.”

Bonus Bucks, which can be
used at Davidson College
copiers or vending machines in
addition to the Union Café, are
usually awarded only through
student meal plans. Morrison,
however, took advantage of a loop-
hole in the system.

“He would falsify meal plans by
creating fake student identities
and funnel those Bonus Bucks into
his own account,” said Whitley.
“Then Morrison would use the
Bonus Bucks to fund his extrava-
gant lifestyle. We are talking about

dies.”

Public outrage has grown as the
details of Morrison’s greed have
surfaced. Many are calling for a
thorough investigation of Union
Café President Kenneth Roy as
well.

“We are fed up with corporate
greed at this school and in this

Former Union Café Vice President Jeffrey
Morrison is removed by Campus Safety after
embezzlement allegations led to his firing

country as a whole,” said Betsy
Redman ’07. “While the big-hot
executives stuff their gluttonous

faces with chicken ranch grinders

and trendy coffee-based drinks,
the common student is
left to fend for them-
selves, carefully auditing
every Xerox copy or Cat
Cupps refill.”

Whitley suggests new
or modified accounting
standards and business
practices concerning
Bonus Bucks along with
swift and harsh punish-
ment for executives who
abuse their power.

“It’s difficult to bring
these charges to a gov-
ernment organization or
judicial board since
these are not federally
approved forms of cur-
rency,” said Whitley.
“But we will pursue any
avenue we can to punish
these individuals, possi-
bly in the form of fines, social pro-
bation or a letter home.”

Unfortunately, the repercus-
sions of these crimes are ongoing.
Individual Union Café workers
and shareholders have lost thou-
sands of dollars in Bonus Bucks as
a result of Morrison’s thievery and
the resulting scandal.

The Davidsonian

Union Café executive dismissed for embezzling Bonus Bucks

quesadilla orders by the hundred,
Cherry Cokes by the thousand. He
would fill his pockets with pickle
spears and go home each day with
a briefcase full of gums and can-

Michael Reyes, the President of
the Union Café Workers’ Union
(the Union Union), said many
workers have lost Bonus money
that they may never be able to
recover.

“Combined, my workers have
lost millions upon millions from
their Bonus pensions and Bonus
retirement accounts,” said Reyes.
“I know Union Union members
who had saved enough to never
have to pay to use a copier again
and are now broke. How do they
expect these workers to feed their
families? With Declining Balance?

“He would fill his
pockets with pickle
spears and go home

each day with a

briefcase full of
gums and candies.”

This is simply shameful.”

Several sources have indicated
that Morrison’s dismissal is the
first of many. “Trust me, this thing
is big,” said Officer Whitley. “I
mean, we're talking Big Grab chip
bag big.” :

Career Services begins critiquing Facebook.com profiles

Last Wednesday, Career
Services began critiquing
Facebook profiles for the first
time. Career Services employee
Anne Lechner had a table set up by
the stairs in Vail Commons and
read student profiles on her laptop
computer.

“We recognized
the need to move
beyond resume cri-

“After two years

n’t want something stupid like my
interest in role playing games or
necromancy to ruin my future job
opportunities.”

Lechner reported that she
reviewed between 15 and 20 pro-
files during the lunch period.

“The most
common
problem the
students

caus sce it was time to retire vere bvins
tees i Sates!
out their appii- POSition as ‘Admiral vechuer.
‘weve heart many  Blackout’.” =e npoyere

stories of students
getting turned down
for jobs because their potential
employers viewed their Facebook
profile and saw something they
thought was unprofessional or just
didn’t like.”

Career Services placed such an
emphasis on their new critiquing
campaign that Lechner and other
employees verbally accosted near-
ly every student that walked past
their table.

Economics major _ Sterling
Jameson ’06 was one of the stu-
dents who got his profile critiqued.

“I applied to several big compa-
nies like Bank of America and
Sony-Ericsson,” said Jameson, “so
I wanted to give myself the best
shot I could at getting hired. I did-

don’t want to

see scantily
clad college students getting drunk
and dancing.”

Jessica Lindsey ’07 was one stu-
dent who had to remove some of
her photo albums.

“I was so bummed when I had to
get rid of all my pictures from
Black Light Beach Party,” recalled
Lindsey. “I even had to change my

_ profile picture. It was pretty much
the best picture of me grinding
between two guys that I had.”

Career Services even recom-
mended that students drop out of
groups that were either disrep-
utable or had disreputable mem-
bers.

Steve Johnson ’o8 decided to
revoke his membership to the

‘Students Against Showing Up to
Our Future Jobs on Time’ club.

“SASUTOFJOT was a fun club
while it lasted,” said Johnson, “but
I could see how potential employ-
ers could see my participation in it
as a negative character trait.”

- Angela Trent ’07 also dropped

out of a Facebook club in fear of it
affecting her future career plans.

“My goal is to become a pediatri-
cian,” said Trent, “so I decided that
after two years, it was time to
retire from my officer position as
‘Admiral Blackout’ in the ‘Connor
Girls Party Harder’ club.”

Several students were also told

that their movie interests were not
suitable to potential employers.

“They said that I should take
Donnie Darko off of my favorite
movies . list,” said Derek Holmes
‘o8. “Apparently, an interest in it
suggests to employers that you
have an antisocial personality and
would not perform well in a social
work environment.”

The Career Services’ employees
also recommend disabling the
‘Wall’ feature of Facebook, as
employers are reported to look
down upon applicants who have
naked women drawn out in ASCII
characters.
