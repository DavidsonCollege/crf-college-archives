Kruse’s Cubby
I still hate

the Panthers

By MICHAEL KRUSE

Sports Editor

In last Tuesday’s Observer,
Panthers offensive tackle Blake
Brockermeyer was quoted as say-
ing, “We’re not going to go 16-0.
I can almost promise you that.
We’ ll lose a game, and probably
two.”

Almost ,Mr. Brockermeyer?
A game? Probably two?

Like he evidently does to
everything else he encounters,
Brockermeyer ended up eating
his words in a big way yesterday,
as the highly touted, used-to-be-
undefeated Panthers. Express
came crashing to the ground in a
fiery heap of twisted metal, los-
ing to their expansion brethren
Jacksonville Jaguars.

And I’ve got a feeling that
yesterday’s loss will ultimately
serve merely as anappetizer. The
entree is yet tocome. And don’t
forget dessert...

Was anyone watching the
49ers-Falcons game yesterday af-
ternoon near the end of the first
half when John Madden turned
in the greatest incoherent (per-
haps drunken), rambling dis-
course in the history of
sportscasting, each comment
more ridiculously absurd and idi-
otic than the one before it?

And he wasn’t even talking
about football. As the blimp-
cam showed a tiny rock-like is-
land in San Francisco Bay, he
began talking about:seals. And
the rock. And fish. And fisher-
men competing with the seals for

the fish.

And as John Madden usu-
ally does, he seized the occasion
to use the telestrator to the
penultimate. You know. The
chalkboard thingy. He circled
the rock, labled the seals on the
rock with X’s and then demon-
strated exactly how the seals go
after the fish.

This went on for minutes.
Meanwhile, the Niners were re-
covering from their little Caro-
lina debacle by abusing the pa-
thetic Falcons. But that hardly
mattered. Madden was speak-
ing. And I was listening....

The men’s soccer team plays
all its games at Richardson Field.
The women’s soccer team is of-
ten relegated to their own little
personal field behind the senior
apartments near the IMAC fields.

Seeing as this is the case,
why doesn’t the women’s bas-
ketball team play the majority of
their contests in Johnston Gym?
Or more appropriately, why does
the women’s soccer team ever
not play at Richardson?

This from a school that re-
fuses to send cheerleaders to away
football games apparently be-
cause there’s no female equiva-
lent of football for which they
could also cheer.

Champions of gender equity.
That we are.

Women’s soccer sits atop conference

By WILL BRADSHAW
Sports Editor

The women’s soccer team
came home to the friendly con-
fines of Richardson field last
Wednesday and broke out of their
scoring drought by beating App.
St. 3-1.

Finishing three goals against
the Mountaineers (2-7, 1-2) didn’t
just up the Wildcats record to 4-4,
2-0 in the conference, it proved
this team could score.

“Three goals seems like a mil-
lion today. It allows us to relax a bit
and actually play,” coach Kevin
Hundley said. “We’ve played so

close (so far this season). That
wears on the front players who
press to score, and makes our backs
cautious. Soccer is a game that if
you play too tight you don’t play as
well as you’re capable.”

And no one appreciates the
extra goals more than goalkeeper
Allison Noznesky. .

“We started taking chances
tonight. (Everyone) saw how many
times their keeper had to come out
on the ground. That hasn’t hap-
pened atall this year, and it’s good.
It means we’re jumping on every
loose ball in the box,” she said.

Amy Kanoff started the Wild-
cat barrage in the 18th minute.

Ginny Dye hit a cross from the left
flank that Lucia Plosser tried to
settle at the six. Plosser knocked it
out to an onrushing Kanoff who
ripped a volley from 30 yards out
that beat Mountaineer keeper
Kelley Guinn.

But Kanoff’s goal was the only
scoring the Wildcats could muster
in the first half despite outshooting
the Mountaineers 10-1 and domi-
nating the play.

After the break, the Wildcats
continued to control the game and
put it out of reach with a flurry of
goals in the middle of the period.

Dye got behind the defense in
the 56th minute with a through ball

from Plosser. She carried it to the '
top of the penalty area where she
chipped Guinn to finish her team-
leading fourth goal and her third
game-winner.

Five minutes later Amy
Balsinger ended any Mountaineer
hopes at a comeback. Dye hit a
shot that Guinn was able to dive
and deflect, but Balsinger rushed
onto the ball and headed it into the
now-empty net.

“A lot of people on the team
were very frustrated, especially
after losing to Charleston (2-1, last
weekend) when we had outshot

Time runs out on Homecoming

Wildcat defenders, led by Shreve Arial and Wes Thornton, swarm J.D. Davis of Emory & Henry.

Saturday afternoon at
Richardson Field was almost a
fairytale.

Homecoming festivities, a
crowd of over three thousand, and
the spirit of the home opener were
all motivational tools for Davidson
in its showdown with the Emory
& Henry Wasps, ranked 18th na-
tionally in Division II.

The Wildcats ultimately came
up short, falling 24-17, to their
bigger, stronger opponents in an
exciting game which proved the
team is turning the corner.

“The previous three years
coming in, we had been beaten (by
Emory & Henry) by a combined a
score of 80-7,” head coach Tim
Landis told the Charlotte Observer.
“We were shut out twice. So today
I’m real proud of the guys.”

The Wildcats, clearly under-

sized against an Emory & Henry
offensive line that averaged 278

‘pounds, continued to fight back

until the end.-

After falling behind 14-3 at
halftime, Jay Ariail recovered a
fumble inside the Wasps territory,
giving Davidson solid field posi-
tion.

Tommy Dugan marched the
Wildcats down the field and found
freshman fullback Eric Ferguson
on a 7-yard flare pass to cut the

margin to 14-10 early in the third
quarter.

‘After Emory & Henry added
another touchdown and a field
goal, Davidson looked to be out
of the game. But reserve quarter-
back Matt Strader had other ideas,
driving the Wildcats 72 yards and
lofting a 28-yard touchdown pass
to Kirk Roberts.

Strader, in his first action of
the season, completed 4-of-4
passes for 62 yards on the scoring
drive.

“I was just thankful to get
the opportunity,” said Strader. “T
think if we had had two more
minutes, we could’ve won the
game. I truly believe that. I think
we could have driven the ball
down the field.”

After a Davidson onsides
kick attempt failed, Emory &
Henry ran the final 57 seconds
out.

“We didn’t give up,” said
Roberts. “We kept fighting until
the end.”

But the determination of
Davidson was not enough to over-
come the Wasp rushing attack,
which rolled for 321 total yards,
including 142 by tailback J.D.
Davis. Davidson was held to an
anemic 64 rushing yards.

The Wildcat defense was
able to counter by forcing two
critical turnovers though, keying
offensive opportunities.

“Our defense played really
well and gave our offense several
chances to scort,” said Ferguson.
“We were just unable to score in
key sitiuations.”

Despite the 1-2 start, the team
is still positive.

“Coach Landis told us that if
we keep playing like we have
been, there is no reason why we
can’t go 8-2,” Ferguson added.

Men’s soccer drops three straight, falls to 6-6

By DanteL Motz

After starting the season with
an impressive 5-1 mark, the men’s
soccer team has lost five of their
last six.

On Tuesday; 20th-ranked
UNC Greensboro blasted a hap-

less Davidson team. After playing
a scoreless first half in which the
Wildcats outshot the Spartans, 7-
6, Davidson virtually disappeared
in the second. Led by a Jeremy
Fedor hat trick, UNCG ran off five
unanswered goals.

“Tt’s very disconcerting when
when we outplay our opponent (like

we did tonight in the first half), but
are unable to find the back of the
net,” said head coach Charlie
Slagle. “We’re creating the oppor-
tunities but we’ve got to concen-
trate on taking advantage of them.”

Host Davidson suffered their
first defeat at home and seemed to

_ give up after the first Spartan goal

scored with 33:48 left in the game.

“We didn’t show the charac-
ter that we needed to after giving
up the first goal,” said Slagle.
“Good teams are able to come back
from a deficit, and tonight we
didn’t.”
