Southern Conference Tennis Finals Here Tomorrow

Toit VMI

Wildcat Baseballers

Tomorrow

Davidson’s varsity baseball team hits VMI in Lexington,
Va., tomorrow in the final scheduled game of the 1954 season.
The tilt will be a Southern Conference affair and could have
an important effect on the family standings.

The Davidson club now has a
3-2 conference record and stands
in fourth place in the Southern
rankings. The Cadets are currently
in seventh place with a 5-4 record.
Richmond and The Citadel stand
atop the standings with 3-1 records.

By winning against the VPI Gob-
blers this afternoon and taking to-
morrow’s contest, Davidson could
move into the lead if the leaders
should falter. Ish Bennett was
scheduled to pitch today’s contest
with tomorrow's, mound choice
still unannounced by Coach Cle-
ments. |

Last Monday, the Cats were to
play Furman’s Purple Hurricane
ip a doubleheader, but the rains
came, and the twin bill was post-
poned indefinitely. It may be re-
scheduled, but the time element
-may prevent the return of the
Paladins to the local diamond.

Last weekend, Coach Chuck Cle-
ments’ crew played host to the
league-leading Citadel Bulldogs in
a pair of contests. On. Friday, the
Cats knocked the Bulldogs out of
first place temporarily by taking
a 10-9 decision. But on Saturday,
the Cadets came back to take a
wild, 15-12, win. Both games were
played loosely, with many errors
being made.

In the first contest, Davidson
came from behind in the final in-
nings to wipe out a five-run deficit
and take the victory. The Cats
secured the winning run in the last
half of the eleventh inning.
“Squirrel” Beardsley was the win-
ning pitcher.

On Saturday, the Bulldogs
pounded three local pitchers for
eleven runs in the first inning but
had to score three runs in the
eighth inning to come out the vic-
tors. The scrappy Davidsonians

picked away at the tremendous’

lead until the score after seven
innings was only 12-11. But the
Cadets tagged Ish Bennett for three
tallies in the eighth, and the lone
Cat run in the ninth went for
naught.

Two Citadel third sackers were
hurt in the series. After colliding
with Bill Rowland in a close play
in the first game, the regular hot
corner man was forced to retire
from the game. On Saturday his
replacement was hit in the head by
a line drive.

McKee Selected As
New Davidson Sports
Publicity Director

In a meeting of the Davidson
Athletic Committee last Friday,
tennis coach Dick McKee was
selected as the new Davidson
sports publicity director. In an
action which was unexpected, since
the job was only recently put
under the direction of students,

the committee reversed its previous:

decision to vacate the position of a
full-time director.

Athletic Director Paul Scott has
announced that Coach McKee will
begin his duties next September
when Davidson's fall session be-
gins. He will work in cooperation
with the school publicity office
which handles all other Davidson
publicity.

Coach McKee replaces Alden
Williams, a senior who has been
handling the job since February,
when Elgin White was moved into
the school publicity office. McKee
will have student assistance next
year, but the students will not be
fully responsible for the job, as it
was previously planned.

Coach McKee is certainly not a
stranger in the = sports-writing
ranks. He has previously conducted
several tennis columns in The
Charlotte News.

Cat Track Team
Finishes Work-Outs
For Conference Meet

The Davidson track team has
completed workouts for the meet
with N.C. State tomorrow, their
last encounter before the Southern
Conference meet on the 14th and
15th. The Wildcats, who have won
three meets and placed second in
two triangular meets, will be
journeying to Blacksburg with
several potential winners and a
good chance to place high in the
final totals. Coach Whittle will be
taking a squad of 14 men to the
two-day affair.

Frank Mitchner and Phil Koonce
will team up to run the 100-yard
dash and the 220-yard dash where
they should rack up valuable
points. Bill Shipley is entered in
the 440 and 880-yard dashes, with
help from Doug Andrews in the
440. In the mile and 2-mile, Homer
Sparks, Floyd Feeney, and Andy
Turner will represent the Wild-
cats.

Tim Gilley, Harry Petersen and
Ralph Petree are the team’s weight
men in the shot putt and discus
events, while Harley. Smith and
“Bubba” Martin will throw the
javelin. Jack Huifaker will vie for]:
honors in the high jump and broad
jump, accompanied by Koonce in
the broad jump. Shipley, Koonce,
Mitchner and Andrews make up
the mile relay team.

Approximately twenty-five boys
are trying out for Sigma Delta
Psi, national athletic fraternity, at
the present time, and one of them,
Bill McNair, has completed his re-
quirements for entrance. Many
lack only one event before gaining
membership. Coach Whittle urges
all men who hope to try out for
the fraternity to begin passing off
their events as soon as possible,

DAVIDSON GOLFERS
IN S.C. TOURNAMENT

The Davidson varsity golf team
is currently competing in the an-
nual Southern Conference Golf
tournament which is being held in
Richmond, Virginia. The golfers
left last Wednesday for Richmond
to prepare for the meet which
is being held today ana tomorrow.
Coach Elgiln White is accompany-
ing the team on the trip.

Captain Graeme Keith will be
the leading Davidson hope for con-
ference honors in the.tournament,
but in a meet of this kind, any
player who is hitting exceptional-
ly well can easily take a high
position in the resulting stand-
ings.

Joe Jenkins and. Skipper Hall
will also be threats for the Cats.
Both boys have done exceptionally
well this season and should hit
their peak this weekend.

Last Monday, the Wildeat link-
sters played their last match of
the regular season. The Davidson
club met Wofford’s Terriers on. the
Myers Park Country Club course
in Charlotte, and the host team
downed the Terriers, 2213-4\%4.
Graeme Keith was medalist for the
day with an even-par 72, while Jack
Hankins topped the Wofford scores
with a 79.

The Davidson freshman golfers
met Gastonia’s team this past week
and came out the victors by a
1342-1142 count. The frosh link-
Sters finish their 1954: season next
Tuesday at Salisbury, when they
meet the freshman team from
North Carolina State.
