Day at the lake dampened by weather

Alternative social option experiences clouds and rain

*“ By Martha Knight
Food, music, games...but
where was the sun?
Despite cloudy skies Davidson
students, faculty, and staff gath-
ered at the lake campus on Satur-
day, September 25, when the
Union, Student Government As-
sociation, and Patterson Court
Council jointly sponsored their tra-
ditional fall Day At the Lake.
This campus-wide activity al-
lowed freshmen, upperclassmen,

professors, and staff members to:

get to know one another better
after having several weeks of ad-
justment to a new school year.
Patterson Court Council President
Julie Petty says that the event was
designed to encourage social inter-
action in a relaxed environment
free from alcohol.

She says that some people do
not feel comfortable with the at-
mosphere of Patterson Court and
that this kind of day gives the en-
tire school community the oppor-
tunity to come together and have a

_ good time.

The choice of many activities
offered something for everyone.
Adiscjockey entertained the crowd
with music while some played vol-
leyball, football, or water sports.

Others had fun just hanging
out and meeting new people while
enjoying hamburgers and cold
drinks.

Most people agreed that the
cold, cloudy weather kept many
others away. Union Board mem-
ber Jennifer Humphrey thinks that
timing also could have contributed
to the low turnout. She said that

the freshmen have recently been
involved in many planned activi-
ties and that this same event in the
spring will give people a chance to
shed their winter clothesand spend
more time outside.

Although only around 100
people attended the festivities,
those who did come enjoyed the
day.

Senior Karen Marshall admit-
ted, “I wasn’t sure about coming
because of the weather, but now
that I’m here I wish more people
had come.” :

The Union, SGA, and PCC
wish to thank all those who helped
with the set-up, cooking, andclean-
up. They wouldalso like toremind
everyone who missed the fun that
there will be another Day at the
Lake in April.

~SPEAS continued from page 1

aged care’s strengths as well as
economic and moral costs to serve
as a backdrop for the next day’s
speakers.

Friday morning at 8:30, par-
ticipants reconvened to: hear Dr.
Kenneth Shull of Lexington Medi-
cal Center’s thoughts on “The Ups,
Downs, Ins and Outs of Managed
Care in the ’90s: The Making or
Breaking of American Health Care
Institutions.”

Shulladdressed the majorcon-
cerns of North Carolina hospitals
and long term care providers con-
cerning recent health care reform
proposals.

At 10 a.m. Karen Igate with
the Washington Business Group
on Health examined the contents
of a reasonable health care pack-
age, employers’ obligations, and
employees’ rights in “Employers,
Employees, and Health Care Costs:
On Renegotiating Health Care
Benefits Packages Equitably.”

Igate was followed at 11:30
a.m. by Dr. Eric Cassell of Cornell
University. Medical College.
Cassell addressed the issue of how
health care reform will affect clini-
cal ethics in “The Patient-Physi-
cian Relationship in the ’90s: Sa-
cred Bond or Business Deal.”

The colloquium’s final ses-
sion consisted of the presentation
ofacasestudy by Cassell followed

‘by responses from a panel com-

posed of the four guest speakers.
The Speas Colloquium, which

~ is held annually at Davidson Col-

lege, was established by R. Dixon
Speas in memory of his brother
Frederick. Womble Speas.
Frederick Speas was a graduate of
the Davidson class of ’43 whose
life, foreshortened by leukemia,

embodied the ideals of compas-
sion and caring to an extraordinary
degree. Each year the colloquium

attempts to provide analysis and
discussion of issues relevant to the
provision of health care in ourcom-
plex society.

The colloquium was jointly

sponsored by the Office of Con-
tinuing Medical Education of
UNC-Chapel Hill, the Charlotte
Area Health Education Center, and
Davidson College. Davidson’s Dr.
Lance Stell and Dr. Rosemarie
Tong served as Colloquium Direc-
tors.

Tong publishes 5th book

By Mary McCrory
and College Relations

Three years ago, when Pro-
fessor Rosemarie Tong began writ-
ing a book on feminist medical
ethics and reproductive technolo-
gies she realized that there was a
greater need for a book about gen-
eral feminist and feminine ap-
proaches toethics. Her fifth book,
Feminine and Feminist Ethics, is
the result.

The book, written in a “re-
laxed, jargon-free style” for both
the undergraduate and the special-
ist, focuses on three different ethi-
cal systems: feminine, feminist,
and lesbian. The first system Tong
explores is feminine ethics. This
system stresses “caring as opposed
to justice, and relationships as op-
posed to rule.” Feminine ethicists
focus on networks of relationships
and responsibilities.

Feminist ethics, as distinct
from feminine, are more politi-
cally oriented. Feminist ethicists
seek the end of subordination of
women, and explore the power
dynamics between men and

-women. They consider issues of

domination and subordination be-
fore issues of good and evil when
making moral decisions.

Many people wince at the idea
ofa lesbian ethical system, but part
of Tong’s goal is toclear up misun-

derstandings about lesbian ethics. ,

“What is it we want ethics to
do for us?” she asks, “It’s not sim-
ply about regulating our behavior.
Lesbian ethicists frequently say that
ethics in the West have been fo-
cused solely on rules, and have not
enabled people to become their
full selves. The emphasis is on
freedom.”

A lesbian ethical system does
not focus on homosexuality as
much as it does on patterns of
domination and subordination.
Lesbian ethicists are concerned
with defining conditions of happi-
ness for woman-centered women.
They make no attempt to force ~
their ethical system on everyone
else, but instead reject the idea that
ethical systems have to be all-en-
compassing and write for them-
selves.

“They provide lenses to reas-
sess traditional Western ethics.
What they have been able to point
out is what is lacking in the tradi-
tion. It would be a mistake to see
lesbian ethics as a complete rejec-
tion of traditional ethics because
they are simply asking what is
missing,” Tong explains.

According to Professor Tong,
students should read this book “for
the same reason anyone should
read a book that will challenge
them to look at different ideas and .
otherness that they might’want to
incorporate in their own world.”
