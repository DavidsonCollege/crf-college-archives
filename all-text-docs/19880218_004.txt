SHORTAGE, from p. 1

no new word processing equip-
ment in two years.

About twenty-six word proces-
sors are currently in use by stu-
dents in the Computer Center,
eleven in the library, and two in
the basement of Chambers. Two
printers are undergoing repairs,
and it is uncertain when Toshiba
will send them back.

Computer Center employee
Jeff Sawvel believes that the prob-
lem could be eased if the school
' would allow students to write
papers on the VAX System, which
has been reserved exclusively for
statistical work. “They should
have left word-processing on the
VAX until they could get more
PCs, because we just don’t have
enough PCs,” he says. He esti-
mates that the use of the VAX

system would increase the num-
ber of available terminals by
about twenty or twenty-five.

However, Casey feels that since
large, centralized systems such as
the VAX are not good for word-
processing, the system should be
reserved for statistical data.

“The college-wide policy in the
five-year plan for computing
states that the machines should all
be kept available for what they do
best,” he adds.

Another student employee,
Susan Swift, says that the Center
is doing what it can to make
computers available to the student
body.

“Tt hasn’t been that bad lately
because we’ ve been opening ear-
lier and staying open later,” she
says.

However, she agrees that there
have. been problems at “prime-
time computer hours” -- from

-8:00-11:00 at night.

THEFTS, from p. 1

In order to deter potential shop-
lifters, two mirrors have been
installed overlooking the coolers
and the main section of the store.
As one individual noted, however,
the mirrors are not very effective
because the cashier is unable to
see them from the register.

Café staff have discussed in-
stalling video cameras as a further
measure if shoplifting becomes
enough of a problem, but Stone
comments that ““We’re hoping it
won’t have to come to that.”

Stone emphasized that “it’s not
alarge problem and it’s not neces-
sarily the students who are doing
it.”

“We have alotof outside people
who come in here as well, espe-

cially at night and on weekends,”

Stone said. The staff has not been
able to tell exactly when the thefts
are taking place.

Stone went on to say that “Any
time youhaveastore of this nature
you’re going to have a problem
like this, on any campus. But it’s
a shame when you don’t feel like

you can trust a student who’s
supposed to be bound by the
Honor Code.”

Although no prices have in-
creased as a result of shoplifting,
the costs will have to be shifted
onto the students if the problem
worsens.

In an unrelated incident, the
disappearance ofa class ring from
a display in the Student Store has
been described as a mystery by
Student Store Manager Chloe
Myers, who commented that
“We’re not really sure what hap-
pened.”

Myers said that she “can’t say
for certain that it was stolen, but
we don’t think it was lost.”

If it was stolen, she added, “TI
really feel like the ring’s disap-
pearance is an isolated incident--
I’ve only seen this problem once
in the ten years I’ve been here.”

Myers commented that “While
we’ re not naive enough to believe
that all’s rosy in the world,” the
staff has faith in the Honor Code
and that she herself discovered her
missing pocketbook five hours
after misplacing it, exactly where
she left it--in the TV Lounge.
