from page 14
16 days before the U.S. Olympic
trails in 1992, Farley broke several
vertebrae in his back, sidelining

him for eight months.
He obviously missed the tri-

als, which was doubly. bad, since. .

tae kwon do was eliminated from
the 1996 Olympics. In 1988 and
‘92, it was a demonstration sport.
And in a weird progression, it re-
turns as a full medal sport in 2000
in Sydney, Australia.

“T’ve lived since 1988 with
the dream of competing for the
U.S. inthe Olympics,” Farley said.
“Seeing the U.S. flag raised above
the crowd is my dream.

“Tn that regard, while winning
the national championships is great
for the moment, it’s something of
a step down.”

After the devastating back in-
jury, Farley considered retiring
until he got some sage advice from
a friend. His friend’s wisdom:

“Tt’s not the Olympics that
makes the fight, it’s the fight that
makes the Olympics.”

He’s trained with that in mind
ever since and would currently be
well into training for next year’s
Games if not for the odd decision
by the International Olympic Com-
mittee to eliminate funding for the
sport.

“Winning the gold medal is
just a way of showing that you can
do it,” Farley said. “For me, it is

more of a-reflection of not just °

myself, but a reflection of all the

people I’ve trained with. A man

could never win a medal alone.
And a medal shows the work of
everyone who’s ever helped you
out with no thought of receiving
any recognition for it.”

“Competing in the Olympics
is the highestachievement you.can
reach,” he added. “Giving up so
much to your nation develops pa-
triotism which transcends to so
many other things.”

Farley has one more piece of
wisdom he lives by.

His grandfather once told him:
“Success is not measured in mere
wins and losses, but in how much
you give to your sport.”

With that in mind, Farley has
started teaching the martial arts to
others and views his win in the
forms contest as the biggest vic-
tory since it represents the more
traditional values of the sport.

In addition, Farley sees tae
kwon do as one of the most pure
sports.

“Tae kwon do and running are
essentially the truest tests of sport,”
he said. “In both, you are the only
one held accountable, unlike in
other sports.. In track, you are
racing against time, which can
never be defeated. In tae kwon do,
you are only fighting another man,
and you can only hold yourself
responsible.”

So far, Michael Farley has
fulfilled that responsibility pretty
well.

Wildcats head to
conf. tournament

By Bryan ALLISON
Sports writer

Before heading to Charleston
for the Southern Conference tour-
nament this weekend, the Davidson

“baseball team took on Marshall

and VMI in hopes of obtaining the
third seed.

BASEBALL

But before that, Davidson trav-
elled to Durham April 12 to face
rival Duke. The Wildcats upset the
Blue Devils 6-4 in a tightly con-
tested extra inning affair. Mills
Ariail pitched seven-and-a-third
innings, giving up only three runs.
Chris Pollard won for the ninth
time this season.

In the tenth, Rhett Ingerick
singled, Jeff Andrews was hit by a
pitch. Jeff Coker moved both run-
ners into scoring position for the
heart of the Davidson order. Gus
Quattlebaum delivered with a
single to drive in Ingerick. Brad
Edwards followed with a double to
provide some insurance for
Davidson.

The Wildcats played three
games against Marshall last week-

end... .The..Wildcats .swept..the. -

doubleheader Saturday, 10-9 and
4-2. In the first game, Andrews
and Drew Van Culin both had three
RBI while Edwards smacked a
home run. Brian Penny had the
game-winning RBI in the 10th.
Mordecai Stolk pitched six-and-a-
third innings before yielding to the

bullpen. Brian Cole was the win-
ner. In the second game, Pollard
continued to terrorize Southern
Conference batters, pitching his
seventh complete game in eight
conference starts.

Marshall managed to salvage
some of their weekend Sunday with
a 10-7 victory. Edwards hit his

‘tenthhome run of the season, which

ranks him third in the Conference.
Van Culin and T. J. Plummer both
had two hits.

The éarlier injury to Mark
Reilly forced Davidson to make
several changes. Although he was
not recruited to play second base,
Plummer has taken over for Reilly.

“Reilly still gives us a lot of
leadership from the bench. But T.
J. Plummer has stepped in and done
a commendable job,” coach Dick
Cooke said.

Before facing VMI this week-
end, Davidson played Appalachian
State on Tuesday. The Wildcats
put a drubbing on the Mountain-
eers about six weeks ago. Unfor-
tunately, there would be no repeat
this time around, as Davidson lost
9-3. The seventh inning proved to
be the difference. The Wildcats
had four errors in the inning and
gave up seven runs.

Friday, the Wildcats hosted a
Duke team bent on avenging last
week’s loss. .. The. Blue. Devils
gained their revenge in another
extra inning showdown, but not
until after Jeff Andrews hit a three-
run home run in the bottom of the
ninth. But Duke prevailed this time
around, 13-8 in eleven innings.

Davidson’s series against VMI
this weekend was pivotal. The

al

Wildcats could have ended up as
high as the third seed or as low as
the sixth seed depending on their
performance against the Keydets.
The first game of the doubleheader
did not start out well for the Wild-
cats. Davidson found themselves
down eight runs going into the
bottom of the ninth. Davidson
reached down deep and exploded
for ten runs to snatch a victory
away from VMI, 12-10. Better
known for his offensive exploits,

. Quattlebaum was the winner in

relief.

Inthe nightcap, Davidson tried
to repeat the late-inning dramatics
of the first game. The Wildcats,
down 1-0 most of the game, man-
aged to send the seven-inning game
into extra innings with a run in the
bottom of the seventh. There would
be noextra inning heroics this time,
as the Keydets pulled away in the
eighth with three runs for a 4-1
win. Pollard lost only his second
game against Southern Conference
competition this season. Going
into tle game, he had won seven of
eight with an ERA of 2.15 and now
has eight complete games in nine’
conference starts.

Davidson has a final tuneup at
UNC-Greensboro Tuesday before
travelling to Charleston for the
Southern Conference Tournament,
which starts Thursday.

“Tt is one of the best run con-
ference tournaments in the nation.
It is a great event,” Cooke said.

After losing Sunday's game 2-
1, Davidson's conference record
now stands at 12-12, 18-26.

Seeding for the tournament
remains in question.

Holland finalist at Virginia

By Matr Pirzer
Sports Editor

This week, Athletic Director *
Terry Holland was named one of
five finalists for the same position
at Virginia.

Holland said he has not heard
from Virginia about what the next
step will be in the search, which
started last winter.

He has not had contact with

the school to discuss the job, but
believes he probably will some-
time soon. Holland said he was not
looking to leave Davidson and
hasn’t thought about whether he
would move if he was offered the
job sometime in the future.
Holland is a natural candidate
for the Virginia position consider-
ing his successful 16-year coach-
ing tenure at the school, during
which he took two teams to the

Final Four.

He was similarly a natural can-
didate when he came to Davidson
in 1990, since he starred as a player
here and later went on to coach.
Under Holland, the level of
Davidson’s athletics has risen
across the board. One main reason
for that was the Wildcats jump to
the Southern Conference in all
sports but football in the early
1990s.
