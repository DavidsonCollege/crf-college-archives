This year, the Davidson College

Those who desire private lessons
in some woodwind instrument are in

brings to our campus some of the
best musicians of the country. Al-
though plans are still incomplete,

" I can promise everyone that there is
something to look forward to.

this year. Mr. Pfohl has stated that

made by past _ organizations.

Mu Alpha for their use this year.
The Carnegie set will be moved
from its present location in the Y.-
M.C.A. lounge to Phi Hall.

It will be open to members of
Phi Mu Alpha each night and to
all students at least twice each week.
We invite all students to take ad-

Members On Staff
Begin Term’s Work

Eight Issues To Be Printed
This Semester

Members of the editorial and
business staff of the Davidsonian
have begun their fall work in help-
ing to publish to the students news
and features, which, it is hoped, will
be of interest to them.

Members of the editorial staff are
as follows: Hil Masters, of Char-
lotte, Associate Editor; Harry Mc-
Lean, of Washington, N. C., and Joe
Stukes, of Manning, S. C. Assistant
Editors; Frank Barr, of Concord,
N. C, Feature Editor; Ed Golden,
of Jacksonville, Fla, Managing
Eidtor; Jimmy Nisbet, of Sanford,
N. C, Managing Editor; Lonnie
Turner, of Statesville, N; C. Manag-
ing Editor; Sterling Edwards, Sports
Editor; Dave Gambrell, of Atlanta,
Ga. Assistant Sports Editor; Frank
Barr, of Concord, Music Editor;
and David Farr, of Charlotte, Staff
‘Photographer,

Members of the business staff are
as follows: Ward Lasly, of Burling-
ton, Assistant Business Manager;
Bob Gambrell, of Atlanta, Ga. Ad-
vertising Manager; and Bob Smoak,
of Wilkesboro, Circulation Manager.

Interesting articles appearing in
each issue of the paper should be
noted and read with attention. Ed
Golden’s column “Think on These
Things” is a very interesting and
inspiring article concerning the re-
fligious scope about the campus.
One’s time would never be wasted
reading such an article as_ that.
Falling back upon previous copies
of the Davidsonian, the Fall issues
will carry a clumn by Newt Spencer,
Secretary of the Y.M.C:A. for the
coming year, concerning happen-
ings in which the Y.M.C.A. is in-
volved. The work of the cabinet and
the social life of the student body
for the fall will be stressed most.

dents seem to overlook, but which
in no wise should be missed, is the
newly installed music column by
Frank Barr. The work of Phi Mu
Alpha will be included here along
with other interesting music items.
It is hoped that the “Among The
Greeks’ column will be of interest
to everyone, and will provide fun
and frolic for all. It is not the de-
sire of the editorial staff to offend
or hurt anyone in this article, and
actions against such will be taken.
Finally, let us not overlook the edi-
torials. In a sense the editorials are
the most important articles in the
paper, for in them is expressed the
feelings of the student body as a
whole. So before you lay your paper
aside, turn to the editorials, read
them, and see if you don’t gain
something from them, ;

The majority of the news which
you read on the front page is made
Possible by the help of the alumni
office: Permit us to take this op-
portunty here to express our thanks
to Mr. John Payne for his most
helpful work in furrfshing many of
the articles you read throughout
your Davidsonian. Without the help
of Mr. Payne, the news you see in
the Davidsonian would be sadly re-
duced, And so, to Mr. Payne, we
express our deepest gratification.

The business staff of the Paper
must not be overlooked. It is the
work of the business staff to help
make the Davidsonian possible by
securing the advertisements, which
you see adorning the pages of our
Paper. ;

It is sincerely hoped by the mem-
bers of the editorial and business
staff that the: fall, issues of the
Davidsonian will be the best issues
ever sent to press, and only by the
Cooperation of the members of the.
editorial and business staff and the
students of Davidson College can

this be made possible.
