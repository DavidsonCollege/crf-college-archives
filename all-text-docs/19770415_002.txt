TRANSCO denies tower

The Transcontinental Oil
Company has denied the col-
lege administration’s request
to install an FM broadcast
antenna on the company’s
tower north of Davidson.

Use of the tower was an
important element in the col-
lege’s plans to expand radio
station WDAV to 18,000
watts.

In a letter addressed to
WDAV Executive Director
Earl W. “Buck’’ Lawrimore,
TRANSCO states, ‘‘After
consulting with the manufac-
turer of our microwave equip-
ment, we regret that we must
refuse you permission to in-
stall your FM broadcast an-
tenna on our tower near Dav-
idson, N.C.”’

Lawrimore says the com-
pany fears that the WDAV
transmitting frequency (89.9
MHz) would interfere with
their microwave receiving fre-
quency (70 MHz).

The company has offered
WDAV use of a used 350-foot
face tower instead.

Lawrimore has been investi-
gating alternatives in light of
this unexpected development.

‘“‘We have checked with
TRANSCO’s consulting engi-
neer who says it is possible to
shield the two systems so
interference will be negligible.

“We are exploring the pos-
sibility of running some on-
site sounding tests at the 89.9
frequency to see if there is any
interference with théir equip-
ment.

‘‘But no one knows how
much it will cost to overcome
the problem,’’ Lawrimore
adds.

Lawrimore discussed other
ongoing activities connected

with the proposed power
boost. ‘“We have applied for a
Federal grant from the Office
of Education for funds to aid
in the purchase of equipment
for the station.

‘*Potentially we could re-
ceive up to 75 percent of
construction costs, but every-
thing would have to go perfect
to get that much.”

The grant will include a
request for money to buy a
new tower. ‘‘If we get that
Federal grant,’’ Lawrimore
comments, ‘‘we may decide to
go ahead and build a tower.”

A new 300-foot tower, fully
installed, will cost $25,000,
Lawrimore said.

“Tf we do not get the
Federal grant it would be very
undesirable to have this added
cost.”’

Lawrimore says the college
will probably request a total of
$125,000 to $150,000 from the
Office of Education.

The request for Federal
money will be sent in by April
20 and Lawrimore hopes to
receive notification from the
government by September.

Any action taken this sum-
mer to install equipment
must, therefore, depend upon
grant notification.

Lawrimore stresses that no
decisions will be made during
the summer when student
input could not be attained.
“No one is going to try to slip

around with students off on
summer vacation and have a
fait de complete packaged up
in September.

‘‘Since the students are
going to be operating the
station the only prudent
course of action is to develop a
plan of operation they find
acceptable and hopefully will
be enthusiastic about.”

Lawrimore doubts that the
high-power station can be on
the air in the fall.

“There’s a growing realiza-
tion among the members of
the Board and the WDAV
staff that it might not be
positive to put everything
together by September,’’ Law-
rimore explains.

Many decisions have to be
made, mutual agreement is
important, and because of this
it may be necessary to wait
until late fall or winter to work
out all the details.”’
