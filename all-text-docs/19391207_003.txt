THE DAVIDSONIAN

Question

i the Week

.

With the annual arrival of ye
olde Saint Nick not far in the off-
ing, the topic of many a_ session
on the Hill is whether Christmas
holidays should start later or earli
er than this year’s, or stay just
about as they are now. So this

week's question is!

“Assuming that we have the same
number of days (seventeen) for
Christmas holidays, when do you
think they should begin?”

Charlie Luther, Senior (S. C.):

> 1 would prefer to get eut a few
days later than the present! date set
so that we might have a few moré
days in the new year at home. And
most of our college friends don’t
get hothe til later. 4 think that the
twentieth would be an ideal day
for the holidays to start.

Cam Wilson, Sophomore (Ky.):

Definitely they should begin lat-
er tender the —present—eenditions

cuts left, or even worse, if we
don't have any left, well have to
start. back on the -thirty-first of

December. And if we did have cuts
to start back before
the New Year
suggest we get out

the twentieth, as

be mighty tough to take, especi-
ally when we leave home so soon

Bill Mitchell,

Although it would be advantage
ous to those of us who live some
distance away from school for the
holidays to begin later than now
scheduled, it will be of value to
some students who live close. by
to get out early to work or for
some other reasons. “It seems to
me that the change that has been
made is about as fair a compromise
as could be desired by all con-
cerned,

B. B. Plyler, Senior (N. C.):

Since I'm from North Carolina,

it naturally doesn’t make much dif-

fer@nce to me whether, holidays be-
ging December 15th or 16th and end
January 2nd or 3rd, Looking at it
from another point of view, though,
it does seem that January “3 would

Dick Gammon, Senior (Brazil):

To my mind it would be much
better. if our Christmas holidays
should start a few days later.
I think that the 15th is too early
because by then the “Christmas
spirit” has hardly got into our
homes,_and we still have sucha
long time’ to go, I jwould much
rather-get—out;-—say—on—the 20th,
and thén have until the 7th of
January. To get back here and start
work on the day after New Year’s
is pretty hard, and means that

many of us will have to leave home
on New Year's and travel all day.
I'd rather leave five days later and
get back five days later.
