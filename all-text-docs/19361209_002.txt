WE REGRET...
That the Davidson student body will not
begin its Christmas holidays until December
22nd. This means that those of us who live
at a distance will scarcely have time to un-
pack our stockings for Christmas Eve.
That the inhabitants of North, South, East,
and West Dormitories must still wade through
the mud to reach their classrooms. And this
alter three years of sidewalk building.
The double cut system.
The lack of a social center, infirmary, swim-
ming pool, etc., etc., etc.

PUSH IT... Not a hired hack, but the pa-
geant we mean. So far our Centennial pro-
gram has lagged. Now at last we have some-
thing concrete to work on._ T6o bad that sug-
gestion of trading a few extra days at Christ-
mas for a “stay-to-commencement” program
didn’t go through., But even so, success or
failure of the scheme will depend on us, the
members of the student body. Get and stay
behind it.

GROOMING .. . How is your P. A. today?
Our alma mater being what is called in some
circles “campus school” some of us are in-
clined to grow a little careless about our per-
sonal appearance. Our dress is not governed
by any iron clad rule as is that of some cam-
puses; and we are glad that this is so. But
we should not abuse our liberty.

The Forgotten Men...

Much has been said, so the oldtime spell-
binder goes, of the service rendered to the
college by those who wisely choose extra ac-
trvuties as a part of their education: the ath-
lete. journalist, and student leader.

But have we been frugal with our praise for
the host of individuals whose hours of labor
are. spent in building musical programs for
publie enjoyment?

fleadlines proelaim the merit of the half-
baele who skirts leit end for forty yards, but
we have yet to read headtines for the first
chair clarinet player who skirted three octaves
ota Lizse cadenza without getting his fingers
caught in the machinery. The student body
leaders are surrounded by the halo of pres-
uge. the Davidsonian reporter may grow up
to be a Nozy Broom, and even the debater
has his moments of glory when he sways tlic
multiude of three, or sometimes four. But
it, is a wide observation that the third horn
player does not take the bows.

There is a large part of the student body
whose entire portion of extra activity hours
is Spent in practicng music, from three to six
houts per week, not counting programs, Sun-
day services, or hours spent marching goose-
step and ¢rosswise for football games. This
is work that requires skill, diligetice and pa-
tience, and work that, once undertaken, makes
it nearly impossible to participate in any other
activity.

In praising the building, let us not forget
the workmen.

Xmas Gift Fund

~“ltis more blessed to give than to receive.”
We are all familiar with these words, perhaps
too familiar with them to grasp their fullest
sigmtiteanee.. Yet all of us here at Davidson
have refcived ; most of us have received more
than the ordinary share of blessings. All of
us enjoy health, pleasant surroundings, en-
hghtenment, a reasonable freedom from fin-
aneial worries.

Tt is peculiarly fitting thereZore, that at this
season of the vear when all turn our minds
towards sharing that we give some part of
our substanee towards some cause in which
we have no seltish interest, that we help oth-
ers with no-thought of our own gain. No
more worthy cause can be found thah the ob-
jective chosen for our Y, M.C. A. gift fund.
By contributing to this endeavor you will do
much to bong light to darkest Africa, not
only light in the literdl, electrical sense but
the “Light of the world” which surpasseth
all others.

Dr. Crane and his work hardly need intro-
duction to the majority of Davidson students.
lf vou wish further information about the
suggested gift see the news story appearing
elsewhere in this paper. In the meantime let
us not forget the joy of Christian Kingdom
and let every one of us give “according as he
is able.”

“Unaccustomed as I am. to making
specches—" “Since everything has been said,
there is little left for me to say, so-l—” We
hear Such trite phrases as these often used
when one is called upon to stand and express
himself,
stammered forth we realie the position which
the speaker is in.

Public speaking is an ‘art—it takes confi-
dence and fortitude. And before it is possible
for us to attain the requisite qualities for this
art, we must have experience—the experience
that will train us how to stand on our feet be-
fore an audience—think—and say something
with meaning—in clear diction.

Davidson can boast the members of its fac-
ulty among the best to be found, and in this

-graup there are professors who are well pre-
pared to present in an interesting and benc-
ficial way, a course which every man here un-
questionably needs,

Modern education demands public speaking
and who needs preparation in this respect
‘more than the ministers, teachers, lawyers,
and business men that Davidson sends into the
vocational world.

The school is doing a commendable job in
educating her students how to work with the
mind—but we also want to know the techni-
que necessary to convey our thoughts to
others with comprchensiveness.

Why shouldn’t we all have the opportunity,
while in college, of learning how to speak?
We hope that this opportunity will soon again
be afforded at Davidson.

found that “College men are the
most selfish and egotistical people
on earth. They get drunk too much,
they lack respect for girls and old-
er people; they have no sense of
responsibility for their social obli-
gations. Their table manners are
lousy, and they try to brag about
their dates to society brothers.
They are rude, insincere, disrespgct-
ful, inconsiderate, impolite, dis-
courteous and impossible, that’s all.”
From this we would gather that
most college women are broad-

OPEN FORUM|

Freshmen Dears : - ———

During the past several days my
tender heart has been moved with
compassion for you darling crea-
tures calles] Freshmen: This being
my fourth year here,.1 feel ade-
quately qualified to offer youcyear-
lings words of wisdom, comfort,
and cheer. Therefore, 1 take this
epportunity of correcting your false
conceptions, soothing your rebel-
tious spirits, and pointing out a way
whereby your apparent defeats may
he turned into glorious -victories.
“May a word to the wise be suf-
ficient.”

Consider, for a moment, this
comparison of a freshman with an
upperclassinan (my apologies, up-
perclassman). A freshtnan loves to
talk about how well-behaved his
class is, how over-bearing the up-
perélassmen are, and how unjust
the Court of Control is. An upper-
classman dearly loves to speak of
his freshman days and blow about
how rowdy his class was, how much
he managed to “put over” son his
upperclassmen, and how much pun-
ishment the Court of Control could
have justly’ administered to his
class. And—now get this point,
freshmen—the subjects which <af-
ford the most mirth and faughter
for upperclassmen, when talking
over their first year, are.the pen-
alties imposed upon them by the
Court of Control!

So you can readily perceive, my
dears, that in the completed pro-
cess of your evolving from a fresh-
man into an’ upperclassman, these
class virtues of which you're now
so proud shall change into coveted
black marks; you shall brag about
how much you were able to “put
over” on the upperclassmen; and,
paradoxically true, your fondest
freshmen memories shall be the
penalties imposed upow you by the
Court -ef--Gentrolt

And, presto, your defeats of to-
day are transformed into victories!
The reason you see misery rather
than delight in your present prob-
lems amounts to the difference be-
tween a freshman and a sophomore.
T trust that this suggestion will
greatly comfort you.

In closing, my dears, let me plead
with you to patiently remember
that we upperclassmen were once
freshmen, and that freshmen shall
become upperclassmen.

‘ Lovingly yours,
J.C A.

To Editor of The Davidsonian:

One of the splendid features of
life at Davidson is the unanimity of
student opinion and the consistently
high level which these opinions
maintain, So well known that they
need not be reviewed here, they
show an unfailing sense of justness,
friendliness and regard for the im-
provement of Davidson.

It is somewhat surprising then to
find two flagrant violations of this
spirit among the students. a

The first has to do with the way
announcements from the Court of
Control are received. The power
of any court rests primarily upon
the dignity accorded that court by
its. adherents. Are the cat-calls,
hootings, and wild applause with
which we usually greet such an-
houncements dignified? It if small
wonder that freshmen so often as-
tound us by their lack of respect
for_the student governmént: They
take their cue from upperclassmen.
Such an attitude ‘of Roman holi-
day is particularly unfortunate in
the case of an individual’s being dis-
ciplined as a moment's reflection
will prove. °

In the second instance we are
surprised by the complete failure of
student opinion to act.

Some of us can remember when
‘Davidson was a musical desert.
There were no radios, and music
and a Senttlle A were about on par
—often dreamed of but rarely at-
tained. Now with music to the right
and to the left, the six hundred
seem to be-in full flight.

We do not feel it necessary to
remind the student body that the
various musical organizations are
offering us a privilege in permit-
ting us to attend the concerts. We
realize, of course, that we know
very little about the type of music
Mr. Pfohl is offering. Perhaps “pop-
ularized concerts” -— full program
notes and illustrated talks on the
various instruments would be use-
ful fn fostering an appreciatioh of
orchestral music. But jonly student
opinion can make such subterfuges
effective.

Here is an opportunity for the
student body to take concerted ac-
tion on constructive phases of stu-
dent life.

For all but the stay-at-homes,
this has been a big week-end. The
Sophomore class rang the bell with
a good set of dances, and made his-
tory by coming out if reports are
true. in the clear financially. It
was a good set, and Kay Keever
was worth anybody's three-fifty.
Not to: mention one of the come-
liest passels of gals the Armory
has seen in many a day. '39, here’s
a hand!

—_—O—

Perhaps the most significant
event of the week was the campus-
ing of the freshman class, who
have seemed to have the amazing
opinion that anything they might
do was within the law. However,
they are destined to spend the next
two weeks or so looking at a ‘cold
grey world from behind imaginary
iron bars, which will be just as
rigid, in case they haven't found
it out yet, as the metal type.

—o—

It is too bad they have to call
this proposed panorama of David-
son history a “pageant.” That word

is unpleasantly associated ih most of
our minds with wierd and endless
tortures periodically inflicted on
goers and club members,
The word calls to my own mind a
picture of little Herbert, the butch-
er’s son, dressed in his father’s red
bathrobe and carrying a borrowed
walking stick, impersonating the
boy David, while Junior Jones, aged
seven and clad in a scantiness of
dress that weuld,cause comment in
a nudists’ cathp, declares in a high
trebble that he ts the mighty Go-
liath, and that he will crack the
skull of any Isrdelite that shows his
face. The while Mrs. Jones and
the butcher's wife glow with pride
as the only happy members of a
bored and sleepy audience.

This, I say, is my personal re-
action to the word “pageant.” The
Proposed extravaganza at the col-
lege, of course, would be a quite
different affair. One estimate places
the cost at between two and three
thousand dollars, and capable di-
tection would create an  atmos-
phere of reality and drama. It has
not been made very plain just what
incidents in the history of the col-
lege will lend themselves to dra-
matization, but there ought to be a
number of good ones.

—o

There is a rumor going the rounds
(maybe you've heard it) that a re-
cent faculty vote stood 16-16 on
the question of dismissing school
Saturday, the 19th, and re-conven-
ing it on a Monday. The chief ob-
jection seems to be that some of
the professors object to Sunday
travel. A number of us will have
to travel on Sunday to be back
for first period classes on Tuesday
the fifth; so why not reconvene
at 12:30, the hour of dismissal? You
tell me.

—o—

Funny thing about these cam-
pus rumors. Nobody seems to know
their origin, but everybody repeats
them as coming from. an infallible
source. Take the one above, for
example. It was told to me by a
boy who said he was told by a boy
who knew somebody who had it ab-
solutely straight. Since the fac-
ulty are always as secretive as sta-
tues about their doings in their
own sessions, it seems incredible
that such a report could be more
than a guess. But there is always
a goodly crop in circulation, Other
current rumors: that Sccretary
Hull ‘will be a Commencement
speaker; that Hal Kemp has been
signed for Mid-Winters; that. the
sky is going to fall (more reason-
able than the other three)!

—o—

From a letter of feminine origin:
The co-ed hangs out at the college
store to give the boys setting-up
exercises. Said the sweet young
thing as she took the frat man’s
pin: “I'll be yours fraternity.” (You
have to say that one fast).

Not a bit superstitious about the
13 per cent increase in enrollment
in his department, the dean of the
college of Agriculture at the Uni-
versity of Vermont predicts greater
