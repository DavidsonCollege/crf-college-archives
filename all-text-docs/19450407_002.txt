The DAVIDSONIAN wishes to
express its sympathy to Professor and

‘Jr. With particular regret we mourn
the death of “Little Ed’, former Editor

Quiet C Fk Seek D

With the month of April over-loaded
with activities it seems that the average
student will have to use every minute
availablé in order to even begin to keep
up his grades. And it seems that every
student should be willing to co-operate in
making it easy for his fellows to study.
Why, then, should we stand for the ex-
cessive amount of noise which is made
practically every night in the dormitories ?

Witlrevery week-end loaded with social
activities, and the week-days being used
for practicing by the various college
groups, the nights (when there are no
meetings—a rare occurence) should cer-
tainly. be used to study. When there is a
record player or a radio going at full
blast it. is difficult to concentrate, and
“bull sessions”
much,

Why can’t we have a little action by
someone so that the period from eight to
twelve at night will find the dormitories
quiet enough for students. to do some
work?

Spring Cleaning...

As Spring comes in, ideas and ambition
go out. The inevitable ‘spring fever” has
gripped many of us, and this lethargy is
largely responsible for the lack of edi-
torial material which has arisen at this
time. Everyone does a little cleaning up
at this time of the year, so why shouldn't

we? The students and the staff have sug-
gested many things that they would like
to see praised or attacked, so cae Spring
in our bones we will ramble through some
short ideas which have been accumulating
for the past several months—perhaps our
readers will have some comment, which
we will welcome, and if not we will have
gotten a lot off our collective chests, Here
goes..."

First of all, we students are extremely

fortunate to have such a beautiful campus,
and the recent clean-up has added: greatly
to its attractiveness. Let’s keep it that way
by not throwing trash around, or leaving
the Stud’s bottles out on the grass. Just
looking at the campus these days bring
back memories of last year when the Air
Corps used to occupy the.whole thing .in
the late afternoon!

Speaking of Spring, Spring Services
start next week” and the student body
should not miss he cppertanty to hear
Dr. Davis. The ‘ ices are an old trad-
ition at Davidson, and the war-time Da-
vidson has done well to secure such ex-
cellent speakers as we have had this year.
Every man here should turn out next
weeck—the meetings will be short, and Dr.
Davis, a three year member of the wrest-
ling team while at Davidson, is sure to be
an inspiring speaker for men.

Rumors, circulated rapidly around
school last week, that Germany had
thrown in the towel should start us think-
ing. There will probably be more false
alarms, but it looks like it will not be long
before the mess is really cleaned up. Why
not have an appropriate celebration of the

victory here when it happens—some sort |

of mass meeting like those held on D-
Day? And we still. would like to see a
discussion group formed to-study peace
plans.

This next proposal was made by a stu-
dent in recent dormitory “bull session”
It was argued that Davidson should dis-
pense with its so-called ‘‘quiet elections”
and try the system used by so many other
colleges—an open competitive campaign
in student body elections. Here we claim
that all elections are based on merit, and
that no campaigning is done. In reality
the course of elections is pretty well de-
termined beforehand, and the ‘dark hor-
ses” have little chance. Why not allow
all the students who desire to enter the
race to put on a campaign? Other colleges
allow candidates to circulate leaflets stat-
ing their qualifications, and to solicit
votes. Since it is done anyhow, why not
make it legal? Statements such as this
coming from the student body indicate
that something i is wrong with our system
of government—either we are not enfore-
ing the rules we have made, or the stu-
dents do not understand them! - «

Spring Frolics are coming up soon,
and Midwinters regulations are still to
be enforced. The students co-operated
well at the last set, and they will probably
do so this time, but the rules last time
were said to be temporary—they were
to be a test. But now they are the same
—no letting up, no relaxing of the rigid
restrictions. We feel that “the students
should be given more time after the Sat-
urday night dance, if nothing else.

Several Chapel speakers lately have
based their talks on length instead of
strength. A Chapel talk will be more often
appreciated if it arrives at its point in a
few minutes instead of waiting until the
bell rings. And on Tuesdays. and Thurs-
days the student body would appreciate
short devotionals so that meetings could
be held without having to rush to class.

We have griped a great deal this year,
and praised often, generally without ac-
complishing much, Sometimes we have
seen results, though—the student council
did appoint a committee to enforce the
point system—now if we could see some-
one giving up some points we would know
the committee was alive!

"Round

Spring is here! With the arrival
of Spring on “the hill quite a few
odd sights have come along with it.
This season of the year must have
touched the hearts of the Court for
now the happy

men can be seen wandering on the

sight of fresh-
grass of the campus, Oh, but to have
Spring all year ’round.

Speaking of odd sights, did you
see a certain member of the senior
between

the dorms one day last week? When

class taking a sun bath

he realized that cameras were being
snapped at him from all directions
he looked as though he had been
taking sun baths for a considerable
length of time. I’d blush too, George,
if someone had taken my clothes
from me'while attempting to add
Mother Nature’s color to my body.
I bet that George is mighty glad
that the headline on the latest copy
of the Davidsonian was only an
April Fool joke.

I suppose that Higgie has finally

realized that he did not get a tan

the first day that he was out for’

a sun bath, After asking every stu-
dent in school, “Don’t you think*my
back is brown?” and getting only
negative answers, Warren was seen
between the dorms recently trying
again. If at first®youw don’t succeed,
try, try again.

The most recent fad on the hill
is to bleach your hair. Rod looks as
though he had been working in a
munitions plant and now his room-
mate wants to borrow some perox-
ide. It seems that Smith went about
it in a rather gentle way at first
and he didn’t use enough. I suppose

-that the students will soon have a

contest for the most handsome per-
oxided blond. You fellows will have
to consult Ken for he seems to have
that title, at present.

With the coming of Spring Frolies,
the jstudents will have to
clothks around the campus on
weekend of the dance, will
“sun-bathing” around Duke
dorm the weekend that the dances
will be held, It will be a difficult
thing to do but—we will do it.

The tennis courts are really crowd-
ed tltese days. Could it be that our
co-eds like to play tennis, too?
Have you read, “The Tennis Court
Rendevous”, by Turner and Davis?

A certain Bieta man has asked a
certain movie star to be his date
for the Spring dances. It is true that
she has been-asked for a certain
S.A.E. brother mailed the letter, Do
you think that she will
Frank? I hope so!

It seemed that the French club
really aided the members of the
cast of its recent plays. One of the
young ladies was offered the posi-
tion of fullback on the Notre Dame
football team for the coming season.
Another co-ed has been offered a
contract by one of Hollywood's
larger studios, They want her to
understudy Hedy Lamar and to play
French roles, and I don’t mean rolls.
They also offered the gendarme a
contract to play silent movie roles
but realized that sound has} been in-
vented, Another member of the
French classes pulled the curtains
with so much finesse that a Broad-
way theatre has asked him to accept
the position in their theatre.

In respect to the new decision of
the Court of Control. It steeins
strange that after such a “stern”
beating that it gave the freshmen,
it should completely dissolve with a
wearied sigh. This writer has two
guesses for this change of state.
Either the Court gave up all hope
of trying to harness the “unruly”
freshman class, even though some
were severely warned by the judge,
the
student-council, told them that they
had better quit since they were do-

ing an unsatisfactory job of it.
Which is it, or am I wrong?

or some higher ups, perhaps

In resect to E&sterNt seems pe-
culiar that at this college supported
by the church, students were not
given Good Friday and Easter Mon-
day off. Naturally we are grateful

for the extra cuts, but nevertheless, -

we were not allowed to use them on
those days. Many of the students
whose homes were far distant were
not able to attend the services pre-
sented by the churches in their home
towns, as much ‘as they would have
liked to. I realize that this is follow-
ing the saying of: “locking the barn
door when the horse has “been
stolen”. However it appears that
someone must have been dozing at
the wrong time,

In respect to dancing in the fra-
ternity houses, I have mentioned
this MWefore but nothing seems to
have been done about it.
anything wrong with it? Is it im-
moral? Don’t you trust ‘us? li
girls are allowed in the houses _ it
appears reasonable that dancing
with them could do no harm. It
would tend to devert from other
things rather than lead up to other
things. It would be well; for read-
ing magazines and talking can grow
tiresome and with no dancing al-
lowed, other “pastimes” are seeked,
How about a flew arguments from
the faculty on this problem?

In respect to Spring. Another poor
fool has fallen for a pair of flash-
ing eyes and a pretty limb. Spring
had such an effect on this lover
that he even cashed in all of his life
savings to purchase a diamond (?)
ring. Perhaps he had the old Mae
West line pulled on him. You know,
it goes, “Give me a ring and I'll
see what I can do for you.”

In respect to the fraternity dances.
It seems as though the’ Betas,
SPEs and the Kappa Sigs had a
misundergtanding about them. No-
body could figure out who was gyp-
ing the most so one of them dropped
out, It is childish for men to argue
and get red in the face over a mat-
ter like this one, when there are so
many more important things to think
about. Why they could not come to
an understanding like gentlemen is
a question they will have to answer
themselves. Suspicion and pride are
sometimes the worst of evils in hu-
man nature. bea

There is a disease known as spring
fever and it affects people in many
different ways. “Shaky”, the dog,
