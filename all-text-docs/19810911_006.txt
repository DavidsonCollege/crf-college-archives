black, or even yellow minor
professors. He also emphasized
that this effort to recruit minor
faculty members will be unaf-
fected by the current College
policy which limits the height
of full-time faculty members to
6 feet 3 inches.

College President Samuel
Spencer believes the race-blind
procedure is unique to David-
son. “Since desegregation be-
gan,” he said, ‘‘more and more
non-white minors have emerged
as suitable candidates for posi-
tions here. They’re better edu-
cated these days.”

not afford to pay.

According to a Minor Stu-.
dent Coalition member, salaries
will be a major obstacle in
attracting minor applicants. He
said controversy could arise if
minor faculty members were
hired with significantly greater
salaries than current of-age
faculty members.

Another problem is how to
contact potential applicants.
‘‘We’ve tried to advertise in
publications like Weekly Reader
which are read by minor audi-
ences,” Grant said.

Philosophy Department

Chairman Earl MacCormac said

More minor professorial candidates.

However, the process is com-
plicated because the current
available minors are in great
demand. ‘‘Why just the other
day,’’ Zimmermann said, ‘‘I

saw some guys from Duke down
at Davidson Elementary
School.”

Minor Committee Chairman
Cynthia Grant said that, al-
though the College is extremely
receptive to minor candidates,
the candidates themselves may
not be as receptive to the
College, primarily because of
the dearth of playground equip-
ment. .

Also, because of the great
demand for minor professors,
minor applicants often com-
mand a salary which is far
higher than their normal weekly
allowance, a salary which small
colleges such as Davidson can;

he recently received 108 appli-
cations for a position in the
Philosophy Department. None

. of the applicants was a minor.

Grant said the Minor Com-
mittee, the. MSC, and several
current faculty members will
provide Zimmermann with a list
of outstanding minor. scholars
who are currently studying in
the surrounding school sys-
tems, primarily Mecklenburg
and Iredell counties.

Spencer said the College
would like to hire one or two
minor faculty members within
the next year or so, but added,
“We've gotten a late start on
this, year, so it could take more
time than we had originally
anticipated. Besides, Duke Uni-
versity has already lured most
of the available graduating
sixth graders in this area.”’

handled the team in a ‘“‘bad way.”’

‘‘He treated us like pork brains. He let
(assistant coaches) Manning and Nelson walk all
over us, and they all belittled us. I detest being
belittled,’’ she pouted.

Conflicts of authority also caused problems for
the team.

‘Epes, Manning, and Nelson could never agree
on anything,” Gibert said, ‘‘Once, we were asked
the average spring equinoctal population of
Albanian tree frogs. Epes said 5 million. Manning
and Nelson said 17, We didn’t know whom to
believe. I felt like saying, Hey, who’s coaching
this team, anyway?!”’

' Ed Trumbull, the team’s top dribbler, also
complained of disrespectful treatment. ‘‘I don’t
mean to bad-mouth the guy now that he’s down,
but Epes is a no-good two-bit impecunious ierk.
Whenever we blew a toss-up, he’d make us write
the question and answer 1,000 times apiece. Hey,
like, I’m not a schoolchild, O.K., Hansford?’

When asked why he went to see Spencer,
Trumbull said, ‘‘Bob wanted some support, so I
went. You see, we haven’t the funds to purchase
hundreds of supporters, the way the athletes do.”’

Tim “Gibert’’ Newcomb, another senior player,
was also aware of friction between Epes and team
members. ‘‘I don’t see what the big deal is,’’
Newcomb commented, ‘‘Evans isn’t the star—I

am. Big deal. I’m tired of this place. Epes is a
schmuck, and so’s Bob.”

Epes was Davidson's fifth College Bowl Head
Coach in eight years. Three of the others now
coach members of the National Experts League.
Charles Lloyd, who coached the team before
Epes, teaches grammar and agglutinative lin-
guistics to Swedish refugees and dishonorably
discharged newspaper editors.

Julie Gibert

Who will next year’s College Bowl Coach be?
No one knows, but Spencer said, ‘‘We know one
thing. He’ll be the best.”
