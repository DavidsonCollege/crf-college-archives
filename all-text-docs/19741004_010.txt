Rejuvenated Performances

A smaller but experienced
Wildcat cheerleading squad
will be featured at Davidson
football and _ basketball
games this year, according to
Cheerleader Coordinator
Diane Stone.

“Though the size of the
squad has been trimmed
somewhat, we felt that this
group will be one of the most
enthusiastic that Davidson
has ever had,” she said.

For better organization, the
10 member squad was selec-
ted last spring following a
series of tryouts.

The six boys selected in-
clude Captain Mark Connors,
Paul Banta, Joe Logan, Sean
Robertson, Howard Payne
and Ed Crosland.

The female members, coor-
dinated by senior Anne Bode,
include Marian Perkins, Mar-

tha Royster and Cathy
Ramos.
“T am very pleased with the

progress being made by the
kids,’’ commented Stone.
“They really have been
working hard.”

Though the cheerleaders
are operating. on a limited
budget from the athletic
department, they hope to
cheer for all of the away foot-
ball games and a majority of
the away basketball games.

““We are even hoping to fund
the money to fly a few

cheerleaders to distant
basketball games,’’ said
Stone.

In addition to a new set of
uniforms, the cheerleaders
hope to utilize a new speaker
system for leading cheers at
football games. ‘Hopefully
these speakers will increase
crowd participation during
games,”’ said Connors.

The squad is awaiting the
arrival of some gymnastics
equipment ordered last year.
These aids will be in-
corporated into the cheering
routines.

Bode explained that the
squad is in the process of ad-
ding new members. ‘“‘Early
this year some freshmen
asked about joining the squad.
We were told by. Stone and
Director of Athleti hom
Cartmill that it woul im-
possible to expand because of
lack of funds,” she said.

“Then we got the idea of

making positions for alter-

nates. Then new uniforms
wouldn’t have to be bought,
because the alternates would
take the place of members for
some games. This was agreed
on, and so we are now trying to
pick alternates,”’ Bode ex-
plained.

Bode’ felt that
cheerleaders have suffered
from a lack of group unity. She
said that members are trying
to correct this problem.

“This year we’re trying to

give an impression of a
coherent group and not 10
loose individuals. Cutting the
size of the squad has helped.
We have been working well
together, and we will make the

squad a ‘worthwhile
organization,’’ Bode. con-
cluded.

‘With all of the hard work
and enthusiasm that we have
on this squad,” commented
Connors; ‘‘this should be one
of the most active squads that
Davidson has ever seen.”’
