Red and Black to Meet a Formid-
able Opponent.

This week marks the close of the pre-
liminary football training season at
Davidson and the opening of the regular
schedule in a game with the strong
University of Virginia team. The Stu-
dent Body is looking forward with great
pleasure to this opening contest, and
there seems to be a generally prevalent
feeling here that the Red and Black ma-
chine will put up a worthy Davidson
fight on Saturday. Altho it is im-
possible to give a comparison as to the
relative strength of the two teams, it is
safe to say that the Blue and Gold squad
will outweigh Davidson by ten or
fifteen pounds. Davidson rarely ever
gets out a heavy team, and this year will
be no exception. The squad from which
those who make the trip to Virginia
will be picked will probably average be-
tween 155 and 160 pounds.

Coach Fetzer has been working his
squad steadily during the past week, and
will depend on speed and fight to offset
the obvious disadvantage in weight.
Black, Lawson and Walker, of last
year’s Varsity, are still out of the game,
and at least two of them may not be able
to enter the Virginia contest. Besides
these, several of the members of the
Varsity squad were more or less seri-
ously injured in Saturday's scrub game.
While these injuries have been no small
setback to Coach Fetzer in the develop-
ment of the team, there is no reason for
too much pessimism. as the present squad
is composed of much promising material.
Coach Fetzer has stated that the men
going on the Virginia trip will not be
selected until after practice Friday aft-
ernoon. However, some of the leading
aspirants for positions are as follows:
In the line, Captain White. Grey,
Sayad, T. L. White, T. A. Finley.
Pharr, Shaw, Robeson, Crouch and
Knight. ‘Those who seem to have the
choice as ends are ‘“‘Bob” Walker, King.
Paisley, McKinnon, Watkins, Flowers
and Monroe. The contenders for the
backfield are especially numerous and
promising. Keesler, Black, Steve”
Walker, Burns, Laird, Crouch, Mc-
Alister, Spahn, Singleton and Lawson
are all good backfield men, and with fair
support from the line, a backfield from
this bunch can do great things. The
team will leave Friday night, arriving
at Charlottesville at 8 o'clock the fol-
lowing morning. If possible, a private
car will be chartered for. the use of the
squad on this trip.

AT VIRGINIA

At Charlottesville, the University of
Virginia squad is being put thru some
strenuous workouts in preparation for
the opening game with Davidson, from
all accounts. The Virginians are handi-
capped by the loss of manv of the Varsity
men of last vear, and Coach Evans is’
trying many shifts in an effort to fill up
the gaps. This task is doubly difficult,
as Freshmen are ineligible for the team.
The line-up that will probably start the
game against the Red and Black is as
follows: Churchman, center; Coleman
and McKay, guards; Blakey and Ward,
tackles; Goodwin and Kinsolving, ends;

Good Players Here.

The prospects for a successful year in
tennis are unusually bright this year.
There seems to be a wealth of material
from both the old men and Freshmen.
Saunders, last year's singles champion.
is back and will again try for the title.
Alford and Saunders won the doubles
championship last year, but Alford failed
to return to college, and Saunders will
probably pair up with T. A. Finley this
year. M. S. Kennedy, last year’s run-
ner up in doubles, is also back, and will
be paired with R. G. Reed, who won the
South Carolina intercollegiate
year or two ago.

The tennis courts are being put in
shape as rapidly as possible, and the an-
nual fall tournament to determine the
tennis team will begin in the near fu-
ture. It is hoped that there will be a
large number of entrants this vear.

At a meeting of the tennis associa-
tion, held recently, A. P. Saunders was
elected president and M. S. Kennedv
was elected manager of the tennis team.

MR. SHIVE FLECTED
TO IMPORTANT OFFICE

After a strenuous year of work as
field secretary of Davidson College, Rev.
T. C. Shive has accepted the presidency
of Albemarle Normal and Industrial
'nstitute, Albemarle, N. C. He is well
fitted for this work, and should meet
with success in this new field. It was
largely thru the aid of Mr. Shive that
the campaign conducted Inst year for
additional endowment and a gymnasium
building was successful, and the good
wishes of the Student Body go with

chin in his new work.

NEWS FROM GAMES BY WIRF.

An arrangement has been made by
which the Student Body will receive
telegraphic. returns of all the games
plaved off the Hill this year. The score
and a fifty word synopsis of the game
will be received after each quarter.
These returns are to be sent as regular
telegraphic matter, and will be sent as
promptly as possible. This arrange
ment will undoubtedly be a source of
great enjoyment and satisfaction to the
students, and is certainly a progressive
move.

will speak, will be in the nature of an
introductory meeting for the campaign.

LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL
OPENS FOR YEAR’S WORK

The Davidson Public School recently .
opened with an enrollment of 210 stu-
dents, thirty-five of this number being
enrolled in the High School department.
Tt is hoped, however, that the number
will incréase ‘considerably within the
next few days.

The teachers for this year are as fol-
lows: Miss Withers, first grade: Miss
Julia Johnston, second grade; Miss Es-
sie Jetton, third grade; Misses Jones
and Roddy, fourth, fifth and sixth
grades; Miss Maude Vinson and Pro-
fessor Johnston, seventh, eighth, ninth
and tenth grades. The four higher
grades will be divided into departments
this vear for the first time. Miss Roddy,
of Rock Hill, S. C.. is to take Miss
Hood's place. Miss Hood will teach at
Florence, S. C., this year.

The new building was not begun as
hoped, but the old one has been reno-
vated and kalsomined and will serve
very well for this year. It is hoped,
however, that a new one will be ready
for next vear. The present outlook for
the school this year is very good.
