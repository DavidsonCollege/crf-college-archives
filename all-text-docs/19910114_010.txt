Awakenings Is Warm And Sweet

Tom Hanks looks in a mirror
in the film Big and is overwhelmed
by the miraculous visage of a grown
man staring back at him with his
own eyes. Having been magically
transformed by a carnival booth
into a mature adult, Hanks’ char-
acter takes on the big city and
teaches everyone the importance
of retaining the child within in
everything one does.

Leonard Lowe undergoes a
similar miraculous transformation
in Penny Marshall’s second film
project, Awakenings. Played by
Robertde Niro, Lowe suffers from
a tragic catatonia that blocks his
ability to communicate, butnothis
ability receive stimull.

Lowe grew up in a Bronx
neighborhood as one of the bright-
est children in his school, but by
the age cleven, the mysterious cata-
tonia defiantly grabbed his con-
sciousness and held his mind in
check for almost thirty years.

Caught in a limbo state be-
tween consciousness and mental
death, Lowe finally awakens and
discovers in a mirror that the
medicine has magically awakened
him from hiscatatonic shell. Lowe
stares in ainazementat the scruffy-
faced, physically mature adult face
that stares back in dull stupor. See
also, Big

How will Leonard Lowe react
tohis new awakened state? Will he
getthe red-headed girl he falls for?
Will his mother “get a life” and
leave? These questions are story
number one. Whois the doctor that
brought Lowe back to life? This
question belongs to story number
two.

Dr. Malcolm Sayer, played by
a bearded Robin Williams, nerv-
ously, but purposely scanters the
halls of the mental hospital with an
intense, albeit introverted, love for
his work and his patients. Primar-
ily aresearch scienust, Sayer gets
the job at the Bronx hospital with
practically no patient interactive
experience. The only friends he
has had since medical school have
been a refrigerator full of plants
and thousands and thousands of
earthworms. :

When Sayer comes upon a
special case of catatonia by acci-
dent, he begins to believe that these
patients remain —_ conscious of
what is going on around them
despite their blank stares. After a
period of research in the cause of
and the medicine used for Parkin-
son’s disease, Sayer attains per-
mission to use the Parkinson’s
disease medicine on the paticnts.
He attains permission for only one
patient. Leonard Lowe. Story

number one.

Awakenings is Hollywood at
its best and that is probably the
film’s biggest problem. Overall
Penny Marshall’s film has all the
pathos of her earlier film Big, but
that pathos is often over-exagger-
ated for those in the audience who
are almost in a state of catatonia
themselves.

The obvious underlying theme
in the film commands the viewer
to live his or her life to the fullest.
Sayer remains to himself most of
the time and is really only inter-
ested in plants. Lowe breaks outof
his shell to live his life, but he is
forced to stay inside the institu-
tion. This subtle irony delivers its
message to the audience without
one of the characters having to

wave his arms saying, “Live your

life to the fullest, life is happy,
etc.”

Yet, Lowe does just that. The
tragic subtlety of the film is ruined
when Lowecomes up to Sayer and
declares that no one in the hospital
lives life to his or her potential. In
One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest,
the viewer could easily determine
that the stutterer was cured by
aprostitute without Nicholson
having to state that mental hospi

Dr. Rosemarie Tong is irate.

She is disturbed about the last
question of the interview: How do
you feel about the Gulf Crisis?

“I’ve never been an absolute
pacifist,” she declares, “I have
always been willing to listen to
arguments that promote war to
achieve ‘a greater good’. But this
time I haven’t been convinced that
a war is justified. As the parent of
an 18 year old and a teacher of
young men between the ages of 18
and 22, I can’t help but fear the
great loss of potential if they should
be killed in a war.”

the class for possible solutions.
She explains this style as one that
