Parking Lot To Replace Duke Dorm,
Residents Fear Loss Of Grand Hotel

In response’ to mounting

Rob-
ert Currie has announced
that a new parking lot has
been—approved for_the-cam

pus,

The lot will be construct
ed-on the land presently oc
cupied by Duke Dormitory.
The dorm will be leveled
soon so that the — serious
parking problem might be
alleviated.

Initial response from resi
dents of Cannon and East
dorms has been extremely
favorable, Currie said, Those
students had been upset by
Currie’s original proposal to
have them park behind the
gym, a quarter-mile away
from housing.

Students in Duke and oth-
er dormitories, however,
have been extremely pessi-
mistic and skeptical about
the plans,

Duke is just like a stately
hotel,"’ said one resident.
“To tear it down would be
insane.”

Most of his ‘fellow resi-
dents noted that the new
parking lot would leave them
homeless and_ expressed
great dissatisfaction.

“Priorities are priorities,”
Currie said in response to
these charges. ‘‘We are try-
ing to please all students,

‘Oh, Calcutta’ To Appear In May,
Gardner Predicts Rise In Audience

“Oh, Calcutta,
neth Tynan’s
off Broadway entertainment,
will be the spring Drama De
partment production, tech-
nical director Joe Gardner
announced this week, It will
be presented May 7-9.

The play.’ a_ series of
sketches dealing with sex
and containing many ‘scenes
of partial or total * nudity,
has aroused critical reac-
tions ranging from _ ‘“‘ob-
scenely funny,’ to ‘‘smirk-
ingly obscene.”

“TI feel the time is right
for such a production at Da-
vidson,"’ said Gardner. ‘Mr.
Barber will. be on sabbati-
cal this spring and I'm go-
ing into the Navy shortly

+ after school is out, “‘Oh>al-

cutta” will provide/-an ‘ex-

cellant opportuntiy for me
to end my Davidson career

with a bang.”

Prof. Rupert T. Barber.
head of the Drama Depart
ment, had made no com
ment as of press time. Mrs.
Barber, however, was heard
to express relief. ‘‘At last
they've finally picked some-
thing I won't have to make
costumes for,” she told a
DAVIDSONIAN reporter.

When asked about the pos-
sibility that the college
might refuse him _ permis-
sion to “use Hodson Hall,
Gardner expressed little con-
cern, ‘‘We could present it
on the bottom of Lake Nor-
man if we had to,”’ he said,
“And weid still draw a full
house.”

Noting that almost all pre-
vious plays have lost money
at the box office, Gardner
added, ‘I dont think we
have to worry ubout that

this time,

“Most productions here
don't take into account the
fact that the average Da-

widson College student has
an incredibly dirty mind. I
think it’s time weidid some-

thing that spoke to the
horny little creatures about
what interests them most,”

he said.

Due to the unusual nature
of the play, tryouts were
held. in secret some weeks
ago and rehearsals are al
ready underway in an un
disclosed location.

Davidson students in the
cast include George Draugh-
ton, Jack Hartman, Cullum
Rogers, Bill Rolland, and
Tom. Way. Females in the
cast, primarily wives of stu-
dents and faculty members,
all said they wished to re-

main anonymous.

Tickets are $25 for David-
son students and $30 for gen-
eral admission. Children un-
der twelve will be admitted
alfsprice to the matinee .on
Saturday, May 9.

If the production is a suc-
cess at Davidson, Gardner
added, the cast’ may go
on a major

_ State.

He also speculated that
the group would be able to
perform in Charlotte, per-
haps in the Coliseum before
