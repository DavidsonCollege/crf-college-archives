Presidents

Continued from page 2

install guidelines in their charter
regarding acceptable behavior for
all members of Connor House as
well as the members of Patterson
Court regarding their treatment of

~ Connor House property and mem-
bers. Way believes that “if you
haven’t made public what behav-

_ ior you expect, you have no basis
for, criticism,” and that some re-
sponsibility has to be given to the
restof the court” to “‘step in and say
‘Don’t do that’.” Way also said,
“If we don’t monitor ourselves, we
will lose our privileges on the
Court, or maybe even the Court
itself.”

Travis Hinson of The Black
Student Coalition believes that the
Report is a “necessary and true
publication.” His main question
is, “What took people so long to
realize that there was a problem?”
He, himself has “been experienc-
ing problems for the last three
years”. The Report to Hinson is
“extremely fair,” but when asked
if it will be helpful, he answered,
“That remains to be seen.”

Hinson noted that “nothing —

came out of” areport entitled Proj-
ect ‘87, which focused on minori-
ties at Davidson, explaining his
“skeptical” view that “this one will
help.”

Regarding the recommenda-
tion for a “true” self-selection
process, Hinson stated that “‘if they
made everything open, they might
as well do away with fraternities.”
He does notagree with thisrecom-
mendation, but,suggests that “fra-
ternities should. be more: closely
monitored,” and that “there is a lot
that goes on that the administra-
tion does not-know. about.” The
placement. of a residence of an
administrator on the court is “a
good idea,” according to Hinson.

Regarding SAE specifically,
Hinson believes that there should
be a “suspension for some period
" of time,” but he “would be sur-

prised if they will actually be sus-
pended,” Hinson also states that
“BSC has openly tried to establish
a more open relationship with
SAE” and that he “personally has
no problems with the fraternity.”
However, he also stated that “if the
allegationsare true [as stated in the
Report], they doneed suspension.”

The Report will be presented
and discussed at BSC, but Hinson
noted that “not much in the Report
willaffect BSC because it is not an
exclusive organization, contrary to
what people may think, it is not
only open to Black students.” BSC
is also a “dry house, so the only
topic for discussion might be the
alcohol policy.”

Zama Neff of Spencer House
stated that the Report is a “timely
investigation,” but in “some parts

"seem a little vague.” Neff stated
that the Report “brings rumors and
problems together and focuses
them in a comprehensive ap-
proach.” Neff believes the address
of the “fear of reporting sexual
assault will better the system that
now exists,” but questions “how
effective the revisions of Patterson
Court will be.”

.. .. Should the self-selection
system go io a lottery system, Neff
believes it will be “difficult for the

women’s houses to exist as sepa-
rate social clubs.” The allegations
against the Dean of Students Of-
fice seem “vague” to Neff, which
seems to point to the fact that they’
are “afraid to come out and say”
their true findings, and Neff de-
clined to comment on the specific
allegations and recommendations
of the Report regarding SAE. Neff
stated her hope that the Report will
“encourage the college to create
more steps to combat the fear of
reporting sexual assault, or to at
least educate" students on’ these
matters.

Spencer will have adiscussion
of this Report at their next House
Meeting, and Neff finally stated
that this Report is “not only a basis

for discussion, but also a basis for

action”.

Stuart Hardy of Pi Kappa Alpha
believes that the Report was
“needed, but overdone,” and that
“the problems they blame on SAE
happen everywhere”. Regarding
SAE, Hardy points out that “it is
not a house problem, it is an indi-
vidual one. If the members of SAE
had disciplined themselves indi-
vidually to begin with, they would
have kept the house from going
down with them”. Hardy went on
to say that “‘it is harsh to make the
whole house suffer for the actions
of individuals.”

Hardy also mentioned the rec-
ommendation of the lottery system
for membership to eating houses:
“Tt would be like moving the dorms
down to the Court. You should
have someplace to go to associate
with people who have your com-
mon. interests”... Regarding the
Dean: of Student’s Office; Hardy .°
stated that is “not as efficient as it
could be.”

Hardy plans to present the
Report to the brothers of Pika at
their House Meeting, Monday,
March 23, and highlight the main
points to look for possible solu-

tions within Pika itself as well as |

all of Patterson Court..

Mandy Aycock of Wamer Hall
also believes that the Report
“needed to be done because of so
much disturbance on campus,” but
also. recognizes the fact that the
“people were there to state a prob-
lem, which explains the negative
tone of the whole report.”

Regarding the current self-
selection process, Aycock stated
that “it works very well for
women,” and, using the creation of
Connor House as an example, she
declares that “people can do. what

’ they want.” If the self-selection

system was modified as outlined
in the Report, Aycock thinks “it
would take something away for
women,” and “it would basically
doaway with fraternities, and drive
clubs off-campus.”

Regarding. the recommenda-
tions for SAE specifically, Aycock
first points out an error in the
Report. On page 4, the Report
refers to the “recent boycotting of
SAE by Warner Hall”. Aycock
would like to publicly correct this
mistake; Warner Hall did not boy-
cott SAE. - Aycock also stated that
the recommendations for SAE are
“extremely harsh” and “overly
strict.” Aycock said, “A few things
have happened, so notice must be
taken, butthere definitely isaprob-
lem with the college environment

-in general. I think they were harsh

pool of students were hear

on SAE.” Aycock would like to
see recommendations that “mod-
ify behavior instead of putting a
halt to the whole fraternity.”
Aycock is not planning on pre-
senting this Report to Warner Hall.
Chris Malanuk of The Kappa
Alpha Order stated that the Report
is “definitely biased”. A “small
” and
there was “more faculty input than
Student input,” says Malanuk. The
major problem that Malanuk finds
with the situation on campus is the
"lack of communication between
the faculty and the Court.”
Malanuk stated that the faculty and
administration “hear of no good
attributes of the Court, they only
react to the bad things.”
Malanuk refers to the Re-
port’s statement that Patterson
Court “encourages good people to
behave badly”(p. 10).. What the
administration does not take into
account, according to Malanuk, are
“all the leadership roles Patterson
Court creates.on campus, and the
attributes of Court life in general,
from social life, to friendships to
service, encompassed.”
Regarding the recommenda-
tions for a “true” self-selection,

Malanuk believes that “‘the social }

life of Davidson would move off-
campus, which would be most det-
rimental, and would further the
lack of communication between
the school and the Court.”
Malanuk stated that it “seems
that nothing was actually proven”
regarding the allegations against
SAE specifically... Malanuk also
stated that the “punishment rec-
ommended. i is a. bit severe,” and
points out that the problems stated
are “acts more of individuals than
the house as a whole.”
Malanukalsostated that“‘Dean

‘Terry is unjustly blamed for the

general problems of the Court.

Dean Terry is the only person to

make an earnest and effective
measure to communicate with the
Court.” Inclosing, Malanuk stated

_ that“with suchasmall scale inves-

tigation, to go on to say the whole
fraternity system should be abol-
ished based on only the negative
aspects is going way out of line.”

Malanuk presented the Report
to the members of KA at a House
Meeting last Monday inan attempt
to “try to maintain ‘responsible
behavior, including drinking be-
havior.”

Susan Wallace of Rusk House
stated that the Report serves as a
“catalyst for more discussion and
debate, and it should lead to more
research.” Wallace is “glad to see
President Kuykendall take action,”
and stated that “the committee did
a fair job in soliciting comments.”

One thing that the committee
“failed to point out is that these
things happen at a lot of fraterni-
ties, such as fighting and harass-
ment,” according to Wallace.
Regarding SAE, Wallace stated
that “they have taken the brunt of
the punishment, and are victim-
ized in the report.” The recom-
mendation to suspend the frater-
nity is “not very healthy,” Wallace
added, “because no one will learn

HOW WISC IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST OVERSEAS PROGRAMS:

¢ Accepted students receive admissions letters (and later
transcripts) directly from a full college of Oxford University.

¢ Students are directly enrolled as full students of the Oxford
college. Qualified students who apply early may have a choice
among six full colleges: St. Catherine's, St. Edmund Hall,
Hertford, Keble, St. Antony's, and New College.

i © Qualified early applicants may share a co-ed Student Residence
associated with St. Catherine's College, Oxford (fully integrated
with British students).

’ e Students accepted before May 1 (for next year) are guaranteed
housing with British students.

e Students will NOT be taught in (and receive transcripts from).an
American college operating in Oxford. WISC is one of the few
completely integrated (academically and in nenioing overseas
programs in the UK.

¢ Previous students from your college or in your field will speak to
you on the phone. .
