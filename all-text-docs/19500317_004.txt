Netters Start Gruelling Schedule

Sir Derrick has been working with his netters
rainy days for the last three weeks and the start of the tennis
season is just around the corner—Monday afternoon to be exact
when the local squad entertains Ohio State, a midwest power
house. This is only one boulder in a rocky road ahead for the
winningest team on the campus, for Barton has pulled no
punches in arranging a near-killing schedule which includes such
tennis strongholds as Rollins, Carolina, William and Mary, Yale.
Kalamazoo and Harvard to name a few. On the surface this ap-
pears to be a slight case of over-scheduling but the fact is that
Davidson's tennis team is potentially one of the best in the East
und will be tough on all comers.

The men on the team will be the last ones to speak of this
year’s possibilities because they don’t hesitate in pointing out,
the hard matches that are before them. But don’t sell them
short. They don’t lack confidence but would prefer for this
season's record to show their worth rather than a lot of pre.
season speculation,

Diamond Prospects Brighter

. If pitchers Norm Whiteheart and Chariton Torrence car
shake off injuries, Coach Jamerson’s baseball team will be in
the best shape since the war. Lettermen are back at every po
sition but eateher, and Johnny Jervis and C, L. Runyan can
easily plug up that vacancy. However, here’s the hitch. Even
with the experienced club that Jamerson has, chances for post:
ing a good record will be considerably weakened due to the new
scheduling which was made by the Conference. According tc
this schedule, every Southern Conference team in North anc
Seuth Carolina will play the pthers twice during the season
This will mean that Davidson will have eight games with th:
‘‘Big Four’? powers, Duke, Carolina, State, and Wake Fores:
which was runner-up in the National Intercollegiate Tourna
_ ment last spring. Need we say more?

The baseball squad will go into action during spring hol
days, the first game being with Erskine next Thursday. The:
schedule is the roughest in years, but the Cats will be a bette
hall club than in recent years. If the pitehing comes through a
expected, look for some surprises in games with the Cunferene
powers in the eastern part of the state.

Veterans Strengthen Cindermen

Pete Whittle is all-smiles these days and he has good rea:
son to be. He has a wealth of material on hand that would put
any track coach in good spirits . . . sprinters like Ken (ood:
pasture and Rivers Jenkins, distance men like Tom and Dick
Stockton and Blake Bradley, hurdlers Bill Pritchett, Bill White
and Tommy Haller, discuss men Jim Vann and Andy Horne,
high jumpers Roger Cornell and Bob Henderson, Joe Miller
throwing the jayelin, and Bill Klein and Whit Cobb for the
shorter distance runs. Newcomers are pressing these and other
veterans hard, and until time trials are run off it will be im-
possible to rate the individual performers on the large squad.

Golfers In Warm-up Today

The golf team. headed by veterans Monty Hill and Ben
Verner has been working out in Mooresville and Charlotte in
preparation for their season. Lack of space prevents us from
giving a run-down of personnel or schedule, other than the fact
that the golfers had a tune-up match with Fort Bragg in Char-
lotte this afternoon.

BOB BENNETT
JIM SMITH

Kappa Sigs And Pikas Dominate Mythical Squad;
Al Fitzgerald Polls Most Votes, Captains Quintet

Once again the Davidsonian
sports staff is proud to present onc
of its exclusive all-fraternity teams
—this time it's in the sport of bas-
ketball. From a poll of fraternity
sports managers a first and second
team of the cream of the frat
hoopsters was chosen. A unique
thing about this all-star selection ‘s
that the top vote-getters in each
position was placed on the mythical

J team and not necessarily the five

men with the most votes,

The Kappa Sigmas, winners of
the regular_season as well as the
tournament, placed two on the
select five. The Pikas, who tied
for second-place in regular play,
only to fold dismally in the tourna-
ment, also landed two berths, while
the SAE’s, who tied for second
during the season and won the con-
solation tournament, put one at the
remaining post.

Kappa Sig Al Fitzgerald, former

all.stater at Charlotte Central, re-
ceive more votes than any other
player and consequently is hon-
orary captain of the team. The
lanky center was the backbone oi
the classy Sigma outfit. He used
his six feet two inches to good
advantage in snaring rebounds, but
he was best as a great playmaker
at the pivot post under the basket.
Most always in the double figures
in scoring, Al got many points in
free throws as well as top-ins.
Teammate Marvin Kelly holds

abd Kelly was always one of the hardest

workers on the court and could be
counted on to be in there scrapping
for the ball. During the season he
displayed a deadly jump shot which

accounted for many points not to
mention a good set shot.

The other forward slot goes to
SAE Bob Bennett, who is a peren-
nial all-fraternity choice. Big Bob
was always a tough man under the
basket and he was likely to top in
a rebound at any time. When he
pumped up one of his archless shots
it was a good bet to go in. Bennett
was one of the SAE ironmen who
usually played the entire game.

The Pikas, a surprise team in the
regular season, have a lock on both
guard posoitions with their two
Jims—Smith and Sifford. Both of
these boys were stalwarts for their

team and racked up many a point |‘

between them. Although compara-
tively shart in height, these two
were long in speed and quickness.
Only a freshman, Smith was a
tough man to guard for he faked
and dribbled well and could shoot
from most any spot on the court.
Sifford used a one-hand push shot
almost exclusively in racking up
his tallies. This shot he would
throw up from anywhere and at any
time, requiring only a split second
to get set. Opponents sadly learned
that he good make a goodly per-
centage of these.

The second team would not have
to make any excuses if they were
to meet the first squad on the
court. Kappa Sig Charley Pearson
and SPE Jimmy Miller at guards,
SAE Bud Aiken at center, and Phi
Delt Auburn Lambeth and Sigma
Chi Tyler Berry at forwards make
up a combination that would be
hard to stop. The speedy Pearson
was a sure ball-handler and ac-
curate shooter. Miller, one-man

SPE team, was a set shot deluxe
as well as a good defensive man.
The second tallest man in the loop,
Aiken, put in most of his points
from close range and used a dead-
ly left-hand shot. Always leading
Phi Delt scoring, Lambeth did
most of the shooting for his team
with a good one-hand push. He
was no slouch on defense either.
Berry was one of the main reasons
why the Sigma Chis came from
out of obscurity this year, The
white-haired ace showed springs in
his legs as he snared more than
his share of rebounds. His coolness

on the court was brought out by

his fine ball handling and true pass-
ing.

Although there were many other
top performers participating this
year, it seems that the sports mane
agers haven’t gone wrong in pick-
ing these players.
