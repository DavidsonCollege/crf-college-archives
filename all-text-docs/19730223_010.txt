Staff Writer

~The season ts over.

Those are wrestling coach
Charlie Parker's words about
the Southern Conference
Wrestling Tournament today
and tomorrow at William and
Mary.

“We are only taking four
wrestlers to) Wilhamsburg.
There is no use im taking a
Wrestler to a tournament in

Which he has no chance to
place.” said Parker

Only Rob Benton, Rands
Webster. Bernard Hollowas

and Bill Garrett will make the
trip this weekend.

Injuries and studies also con-
tributed to the lack of a full
team.

John Scandling will not be in
shape following an ear in-
fection, and Rusty Winchester
and Charlie Dorsey both have
bad knees.

Studies will keep both John

Kennelly and Rob Jacobs away
from the two day meet

“None of the reserves wanted
to go.” Parker said

Rob Benton will take David
son's best dual meet record. 8-0

Assistant Football Coach Ron
Graham will not return to
Davidson next vear.

Graham, a line coach will be
taking over as junior varsity
line coach at the University of
Toledo next vear.

Graham joined the coaching
staff last January. coming from
Ashland College in Ohio.
Previously he had worked un-
der Davidson defensive coach
Bob Mosketti at Madison High
School in Mansfield, Ohio.

Although this was only
Graham's first year at David-
son, he made a valuable con-
tribution to the coaching staff.

Head Coach Dave Fagg ad-
mitted that the staff will miss
Graham.

into today’s action. Despite the
pertect record, Benton is not op-
timistic about his chances to
win the 134 pound weight class.

“The East Carolina wrestler
is very good. He has won four
tournaments this vear against
competition from all over the
east and southeast.” explained
Benton.

Since Benton has deteated
three of the six wrestlers trom
the conterence, he should place
at least fourth.

Baseball Coach Jack Burris ts
contident regarding his
team’s chances this year

soot hs
Ques

The baseball team has 25
Members who have been
holding practice since Feb. 1.
Burris is pleased with the con-
dition of the team so tar and
althougi it 1s too early to tell, he

expects a winning ledger”
this vear.
“The practices have been

pretty informal so far.” Burris
said, “so it’s really to early to
make any definite predictions.”

“Right now. we're just trying
to get in as much hitting as
possible because the pitchers
usually have an advantage over
the batters in the early part of
the season.” he continued.

Burris felt that the team
looked good as a whole and that
the defense was particularly
strong so far.

I think that our defense will
become our strong point once
the regular season begins.” he
noted.

Burris also felt that the Wild-
cat's hitting and pitching would
be improved over last year.

“We have Dwight Plemmons,
Marshall Case. Ross Manire.
Frank Folger. and Joe Duncan
returning from our pitching
staff of last year.” Burris com-
mented.

As far as hitting is concerned.
the team has three of their four
leading RBI men last year. In-
cluded in this group are Captain
Jack Willets. George Weicker.
who was last vear'’s Southern

Conterence batting champ. and
Mark Rodgman

jurris added that tirst
baseman Lv»nn Wagner has
shown much iunprovement over
last vear in hitting

Although there are only four
seniors on the squad. Burris telt
that it is nonetheless an ey
perienced team.

“We have a lew newcomers
who can help us out at several
positions too.” Burris noted.

These newcomers are Dave
Ingold and Gary Pomeroy. both
of whom can play in either the
infield or the outhield, according
to Burris.

Burris also felt that freshmen
Joel Tew, Marshall Kearns, and
Mitch Reaves would be able to
help the team this vear.

Thus far. the practices have
been held whenever the

weather permitted and to date

Thus tar. the practices have
been held whenever the
weather permitted and, to date,
they, have been tairly casual
and informal

“We haven't had time to hold
any scrimmages or to practice
under game type situations
vet.” said Burris. “but we ex-
pect to later this week and next
week too.”

The team has a fairly rough
schedule this. spring. playing
three ACC members. But Bur-
ris still felt: that ther chances
fora winmng season were good.

“TP think we'll have a winning
record if our pitching comes
through. But we won't really be
able to tell until we open with
Duke in a couple of weeks.”
Burris said

year, but he made a tremen-
dous contribution to the
program af Davidson,’ Fagg
said.

‘I really hate to see him go,
but this is a tremendous
professional opportunity for
him,” he continued.

Graham was one of the most
popular members of the
coaching staff among the team.

“Coach Graham was pretty
fair to us." said Ben Hedrick.
**He would work us hard but he
was also willing to kid around in
practice a little bit.”

Fagg felt that this was one ol
Gr.ham's strong points as a
coach.

“We demand that a coach
give a lot more of himself at
Davidson than at many other
schools. We have a rather
small coaching staff. which

“Randy is tournament
wrestler.” according to Parker.
“He has placed in every tour-
nament in which he has been en-
tered as a Davidson wrestler.”

Benard Holloway and Bill
Garrett have outside chances to
place. as they are in very tough
weight classes.

As tor the team winner,
Parker predicts East Carolina
will “walk away with it.”

Parker said that the Pirates
have a stronger team than any
of the ACC teams. Southern
Conference teams. and, with
the possible exception of
Auburn, the 9 southeastern
teams

means there's more work to do.
especially in the off-season.
Fagg said.

“Ron was able to make this
effort. He gave a lot of himself
to the program and it paid off.”
Fagg added.

Although a replacement has
yet to be named, Fagg expected
that an announcement will be
made “ina couple of weeks.”

Candidates presently being
considered for the job include
coaches from Western
Michigan, the University of

Arkansas, and several other
colleges. Some good high school
coaches are being considered as
well.
