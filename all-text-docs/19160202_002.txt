closed his talk with a double plea: first,
to the younger men who are just enter-

in the selection of their friends, and not

second, to the older men,_that they re-

A FINANCIAL BOARD,

Briefly stated, there seems to be im-
perative need for a committee of men who
will have general oversight of the stu-
dent financial interests of the college.
This committee should be composed of
members selected for their general
knowledge of business methods and rec-
ord, for their knowledge of Davidson
student activities.

It would be the duty of this committec
to examine at regular intervals the books
of student treasurers and managers, and
in this way furnish protection both to
the men who are handling the money
and affairs of students and to the stu-
dents.

Not only should their work be that
of auditing the accounts and giving ad-
vise to men already in these positions,
but they should take a broader view and
help to install a uniform set of books in
different organizations,

The crying need for a system of this

_kind does not mean that we now have}:
intentional dishonesty. We do not believe
this to be true. But it does mean that
through lack of experienced planning
and lack of any uniform records, there
is much waste of money, effort and efh-
ciency in the handling of our student
affairs.

The men who have in the past and
who are now filling the places of treas-
urers and managers are the first to rec-
ognize the need for this formation of a
board of this nature.

At the end of the fiscal year, carrying
the accounts through the entire twelve
months, a condensed report of cach or-
ganization should be in the hands of this
board and these reports combined and
given to the students for their informa-

We will appreciate your business.
