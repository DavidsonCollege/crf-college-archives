ranked tenth in the nation
among 206 private colleges sur-
vey in the quality of
education offered. This survey
weighed economic factors
heavily.

Cornell partially attributed
the continually increasing An-
nual Fund to the ‘‘professional
expertise’ of his hand-picked
Director of Development,
Donald Winston.

Cornell pointed out that
Davidson paradoxically has a
smaller development staff than
any other institution of com-
parable size.

The work of _ these
professional development men

volunteers from all class years.

availabiltiy of off-campus
housing diminishing as well.

Indeed, the unit should be
completed before the

construction of apartment
buildings on a nearby tract of
land on Lake Norman, a project
which was hopefully going to
relieve the critical housing
shortage of not only the college,
but of the nearby area as well.

Ina story reported last April 20
in the THE DAVIDSONIAN, the
Tallahassee based firm of
Symon Ryals, Associates
were scheduled to erect a series
of apartment complexes on the
36 acre plot of the Ralph Clontz
estate in Davidson.

The apartments would be let
primarily to low income
families who work in and
around Davidson and also to
college students.

Since that time, however, no
construction has been begun on
the site, and as yet a projected
date for beginning has not been
announced.

A spokesman for the firm
stated last Tuesday that ‘‘due to
the wet spring, contractors are
behind on their work. We have

not as yet hired a contractor for
the operation.”

Arbuckle labeled the 80 class
chairmen who coordinated the
effort as the real backbone of all
the work.

Among the Volunteers is
Congressman Richardson
Preyer, head of the Parents’
Council. Cornell noted that
Preyer had done an outstanding
job of letting the people know
the needs of Davidson.

The Parents’ Council has sub-
stantially increased its con-
tributions over the last two
years. For 1972-73, 512
solicitations totaling $44,722
were received, up from a 1971-
72 amount of 345 contributions
totaling $23,452.

First Senate Meeting Hears
Report On Union’s Finances

By HARRIETT HODGES
News Editor

The Senate heard a report on
this year’s Union financial ac-
tivities in its first meeting
Tuesday.

In his report, Senator Vince
Rabil said that too much money
was being set aside for some ac-
tivities like the poetry circuit
and arts and crafts.

“What we ought to do is
pressure the Union Board to

to the students how the
general activities fee was spent.
There needs to be a little more
accountability to the students
as to how their money was
spent,”’ Rabil said.

The Senate passed a motion to
request that the SGA president
notify the Senate Executive
Committee, YMCA, IMAC, and
several other groups that
reports on their programs are
due by January.

Another motion was passed to
allow formation of a committee
to investigate cheerleader elec-
tion . Cheerleader
Tom Bernhardt said that the
cheerleaders want to have
selection by some means other
than popular vote.

The group heard a report
from Vince Rabil on the in-
crease in theft of books from the
library. Rabil said that over 100
more books have disappeared

arms

dations, or organizations that
have donated an amount over
$1000 to the Annual Fund.

For 1972-73, there were 76 Ne
Ultra members up from 50 the
year before.

Davidson Associates, a
similar group, consists of those

who have delivered
$100-$999 to Davidson’s Annual
Fund during that year. Last
year there were 651 Associates.

The deferred giving program
is also becoming a significant
part of Davidson’s financial pic-
ture. This concept is based on a
gift given irrevocably to David-
son on which the college in turn
pays income for life to the
named beneficiaries.
Ultimately, the college receives
all rights to the gift.

Already, $300,000 in contracts
have been signed under this
two-year old program.

from the library.
In other business, Jim
was elected to fill the

empty Senate seat in the junior
class. Also, SGA ae eideat Bo
Phillips reported that three
more students will be allowed to
sit in on Student Life Committee
meetings. They will be non-

voting members, however,

In a message to the Senators,
Phillips said, ‘‘We have been
assured of a much more active
student role in campus gover-

nance through access to
meetings of both the faculty and
the Trustees.”

He added, ‘‘As we revamp the
college system of governance, I
think it would be appropriate
for us to re-examine our own
SGA structure and
procedures.”

Other goals that Phillips set
for the Senate include creation
of a committee on co-education,
completion of the course
evaluation handbook, and in-
vestigation into possible new
additions to the curriculum.

So I left her there alone with
her misfortunes. And I traveled
to the old sage, the Grampus.
The Grampus was sitting upon
a pillar of tongue. Firmly in his
right hand was the smallest
book in the world.

I approached him with all
proper respects and explained
the Madam’s problem. After
finishing I asked: ‘“‘And what
can be done? How can she at-
tract the attention of the young
men?’’

The Grampus opened the
smallest book. In his high-
pitched voice he read: “‘If the
paint of the oldest house be
crumbling, cannot its owner
paint the house again and yet
retain the same house?”

I thanked him repeatedly for
such wise advice and I rushed
back to the House of Madam
Davidson.

She was still reclining on the
Sagging couch. I ran up to her.

“T have a suggestion, Madam.
You can still attract the boys if
you make a few changes.
You're too fat. Slim down.
Become more enticing. Let the
boys know what you have to of-
er.

And get rid of the Beefeater’s
Extra Dry in your right hand.
Replace it with a light wine.
You don’t need to change your
essentials - only your externals.
But you must change your ex-
ternals or lose all of your
business.”’

She looked up. ‘‘And wot if I
dew git the boys, wot ‘bout all
them girls?”

“Only treat them fairly - they
will come to respect you.”’

Tonight the dull red glow
shines out into the dense fog
that rises from Lake Norman.
The A-sharp of the crickets can-
not be heard - there’s business
in the House of Madam David-
son.

The Davidson Lightweight Cycle Shop is sponsoring a 100
mile 12-hour limit bicycle event for any and all bicycle en-

/ thusiasts on Sunday, Sept. 23. The entrance fee is $2 in ad-

\ vance and $2.50 at the start, and includes a map marked

Run Patch. The event will begin at 8 a.m. in front of the
Davidson College Presbyterian Church. This is no a race,
and the onlly requirement is that the rider complete the cour-

se within 12 hours.
