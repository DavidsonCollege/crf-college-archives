article, it was pointed out that in feature

First; a feature article is not intended
primarily as to the general public.
However, it should be timely, should bring
out unusual circumstances, must have human
interest, and about all, it must be well writ-

Although Davidson did not come first we
by no means came in last. The team com-
posed of five letter men for this year, Vance
S. W., Ramsey, Webb, Gudger and Lennon |
will represent Davidson in a National In- |
tercollegiate competition for a trophy given
by William Randolph Hearst. This trophy |
is open to all colleges having a R. O. T. C |
Unit. The firing will take place Monday
and Tuesday, March the 14th and 15th.

The Gastonia Rifle Club ‘has invited the
team to come to Gastonia and fire a match
with them on Wednesday night. Five men
are making the trip. The representatives of
the Club were here last week and were
very much intrested in the rifles of the R.
O. T. C. Department.

The freshmen started’ firing on the two
hundred yard range Monday afternoon. The
results have so far been satisfactory and
a ‘good record is expected of the class.
After the first few shots one catches the
Spirit of the thing and hates to stop. Of
course the pits are different and Dr. Mc-
Connel has had an unusual’ number with
sunburned tonsils this week, but he thinks
“they will all live.’ Every one that has
fired so far has caught the spirit of the
slogan, “Let’s make America a nation of
Riflemen.”

Let old Squire Pipe be
the judge...

His Honor, old Squire Pipe is unquestion-
ably the world’s ablest judge of pipe tobac-
cos. Who else is by nature, training and
experience so well-qualified to try a tobacco
and hand down a decision on it?.. So, in
the case of Granger Rough Cut, the plea
is that Judge Pipe’s verdict be accepted
as FINAL!

To make a long brief brief: Character
witnesses the country over have sworn to
the sterling quality of Granger. Experts
have vouched for the superiority of its
rough cut. Chemists have testified that the
new “glassine-sealed” foil-pouch keeps the
tobacco in perfect condition.

Finally, it has been shown that by using
this foilpouch (instead of a costly tin) it
is possible to sell Granger at just ten cents.
On these arguments Granger rests its case!
A couple a pipefuls will convince Squire
Pipe that it is the world’s greatest pipe
tobacco. ;. and any good judge of tobaccos
will confirm the decision!
