that was the girl they were to be
with, for you see these were blind-
dates.

The game ended and my friend
and his pals rushed to the rendez-
vous. After waiting about fifteen
minutes three girls appeared.
“Could these be the he
thought. “What eyes, what teeth,

what hair,

ones?”

what nonsense—but to

get back to the story, they were
nice looking girls. After introduc-
tions had made the rounds they all
piledLinto a car which was provided
by one of the boy's fathers. Driving
to a local eating place they MOD
ter acquainted over hamburgers and
cokes and a table of course.

Well, things were working out
pretty good for our casanovas: so
far. There they were driving along
a lonely highway, under the stars,
listening to a poptlar ballad over the
radio. “Ah yes, peaceful, wasn’t it?
But what's this? One of the girls
suggesting her house. Well, they
might try a little dancing, perhaps.

Driving in the driveway under a
canopy of pine trees, it was. care-
fully mentioned by the girls that
there was a lake back of the house,
but did these’ “great lovers” of ours
take hotice? No.

Inside the house several records
had been playing when one of the
girls thought that she should call
home and let her parents know that
nothing had befallen her. While she
was thus employed, one of the boys
trying to be the life of the party
jestingly suggested a game of bridge.
The girl whose house ‘it was, being

the perfect hostess, immediately had

put down a card table and a pack
of cards before the astonished and
surprised eyes of our. friends. So
the rest of the beautiful evening was
spent by our friends playing bridge.

Don't laugh, for “this might be
you”.

or I will report you to the Freshmen
Court of Control.

This is the way the class of '49 is
going to start out. No more fresh-
man’ caps, but instead upperclass-
men caps have been instituted here.

Since -there were freshmen
here in '44 than upperclassmen they
must have ruled the place,” says one
freshman to another.

“Must have,” the second answers.

“Run down to Hugo’s and get me
a Chocolate shake with three dips
on the double,” yells a freshman to
a senior.

“Yes, sir,” replies the senior.

And this is the way that things

more

e

are going here now. All upperclass-
men are subject to rule by Fresh-
men at all times—all because the
freshmen in the class of 48 contained
a bunch of “chickens”.
