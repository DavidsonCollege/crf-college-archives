Four Point Plan For
Better Student Government

The Student Council which took
office today undertakes the tremen-
dous responsibility of upholding the
traditions of student government that
have made Davidson’s system the en-
vy of many educational institutions.

The opening of regular Council
meetings in 1955 to the public started
a trend toward greater general knowl-
edge of the Council's functioning.
Truely this is a healthy sign of demo-
cratic governing. However, watching
the Council in meetings has revealed
to observers that there are some
weaknesses of procedure.

FOUR POINT PLAN

Believing that the Student Coun-
cil is seriously desirous of improving
in any way possible the conducting of
its job, the DAVIDSONIAN proposes a
four point plan of improvement for
the new Council.

ROLL CALL VOTE

1. There should be roll call votes
on every major issue. These would be
available for publication in the DA-
VIDSONIAN. The basic principle of
representative government is the re-
flecting of the opinions of the electo-
rate by those in responsibility. Unless
the students know how the boys whom
they elected are voting, they cannot
know if they are being truly repre-
sented. The voting record of former
council members would give the stu-
dent body a substantial basis for
selecting members during elections.

Such. a provision would limit any
tendency to vote with the majority
merely because it is a majority. Sure-
ly a man realizing that his stand will
be made public will examine that
position with care.

TEST ON CONSTITUTION

2. Senior members should test the
rest of the Council on the -Constitu-
tion. Such a test would be given in
the spring of the year shortly after

installation. The Council members’
having a knowledge of the Constitu-
tion seems to be so basic that one
might wonder about the necessity of
such a proposal. Apparently, though,
it is needed since it was incorporated
as part of a recommendation from
the outgoing Council to the incoming.
The DAVIDSONIAN strongly en-
dorses it.

PARLIMENTARIAN

3. A parlimentarian who has a
thorough and working knowledge of
Roberts Rules of Order should be ap-
pointed. The serious confusion result-
ing from a recent discussion on the
elections policy at one meeting, in
which a bystander had to inform the
group of correct procedure, made ob-
vious the néed for a parliamentarian
who not only, knows the rules but is
vigorous in seeing that they are
carried out.

UP-TO-DATE MINUTES

4. The minutes of regular meet-

ings should be required to be typed
and entered in the official record
book by the time of the next meet-
ing. Minutes of trials necesitate a
longer period of time but this should
be a limited period not merely at the
discretion of the secretary. This pro-
posal also may seem to be obvious
to note, but it is a fact that the
minutes of 1955-56 have not yet been
officially entered. They are one year
late. There was a similar delay for
1954-55. The fact that the minutes of
this school year are up to date this
month is proof that there is no neces-
sity for such delay. Previous minutes

must be available in handling of a.

business as important as governing
850 students, and certainly there
should be no year-long gaps.

The DAVIDSONIAN has confidence
in the ability and quality of the new-
ly elected Council. It is composed of
boys that are an honor to the select-
ing ability of the student body. May
they rule in wisdom.—J.R.J.

Don't Let Down Standards

Suggestions have been made which
would substitute suspension from Col-
lege for violation of honor offenses in
place of the now existing mandatory
dismissal punishment. Honor  of-
fenses, as defined by the Student
Body Constitution, refer to those vio-
lations involving lying, cheating, and
stealing.

The DAVIDSONIAN opposes any
movement to modify the existing
Honory System with respect to
minimizing the penalities for honor
offenses.

Supporters of the proposed move
base their arguments on two factors.
First, permanent dismissal from Da-
vidson with no chance for readmis-
sion virtually denies the involved stu-
dent admission into many colleges in
the nation.

Modification adherents view this
as unfair. We hasten to point out that
personal honor is a thing of too great
magnitude to be trifled with. If Da-
vidson supports the admission of a
convicted student to another institu-
tion by permitting him to reenter Da-
vidson at a later date, then it is he-
ing unfair to both that institution and
to its own standards. If an honor sys-
tem is to work at all it must be abso-
lute, for honor by its very nature is
absolute. Honor cannot be made a
half-way affair.

Secondly, those who advocate a
wider use of temporary suspension

point out that this penalty was, in
fact, invoked by the Judicial Review
Committee of the faculty in one case
this year. Fears were voiced that this
precedent might result in a loss of
power by the Student Council.

The faculty has always had the
right to. review Council decisions but
has exercised this right only when
requested to do so by either the stu-
dent involved or the Counejl. There
is no reason to believe that they will
abuse this power any more in the
future than they have in the past.
The particular case in point was one
of admittedly unusual circumstances.

Relaxation of the permanent dis-
missal penalty faces other dangers.
First, there is the possibility that
justice might be too often tempered
with mercy thus resulting in too fre-
quent use of the minimum penalty.
Again, such relaxation might make
some students willing to take more
chances in their responsibilities to
the honor system.

The DAVIDSONIAN believes that
the strength of the honor system

exists in its exactness, its rigidity, and
its appeal to the best within each stu-
dent. The system as it presently
stands in regard to penalties for vio-
lations has served the school well in
the past and no evidence has been
given to indicate that it will not con-
tinue to do so.—G.L.W.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

HONEST FELLOWS,
ITS ONLY Gas!

Readers Differ on Editorial

ALENDA LUX
PHILOSOPHY

Dear Editor:

In last week's DAVIDSONIAN
there appeared an editorial cn-
titled “Subtle. but There.” It
would seeny that the boldness
and earnestness of its writer
should be commended. to say
nothing of his perception,

Of a certainty, this very is-
bring
forth a raft of “Alenda Lux
philosophers" decrying the
“conservatism and prejudice of
the editorial voice of Davidson
College.”

CAFFEIN LIBERALISM

You see. in ihese benighted
provinces the potent combina-
tion of a Httle philosophy. a
little sociology.
ogy and a great deal oi coffce
qualifies one az an unbiased
liberal, and it would hardly be
fair to allow the voices of these
intellects to smother the sound
of sincere doubt which we
-heard in last’ week's. paper.

MAGIC PHRASE

Dr. O’Connor was a wise man
and he used the magic phrase
“the brotherhood of man.” Now
the brotherhood of man is a
fine and noble thing, but not
when someone uses it as a
sweet-sounding blanket under
which to hide veiled admoni-
tions to a backward _and ignor-
ant Southern audience. Dr.
O’Connor’s presentation was
about as frank and straightfor-
ward as a crooked pole, and it
is very gratifying to note that
at least the editorial voice of
the DAVIDSONIAN was not
fooled.

This is not to say that the
views expressed in the editorial
were either right or wrong,
good or bad, but simply to ap-
plaud the sharp eye of the col-

lege press.
H. T. Antrim

SILENT VOICE
HEARD AGAIN

Dear Editor:

In the DAVIDSONIAN last
week, an editorial appeared
which expresses an opinion
which has been lost for a while
among the blatant cries of that
inevitable campus element, the
pseudo-intellectuals. This is the
group who latch on to every
new idea mainly because it is
a new idea, and because it is
so frightfully collegiate to do
so. It is what is known as be-
ing liberal, to accompany our
fine liberal arts education, no
doubt.

PRESERVE HERITAGE

It was a welcome relief to
hear from one who still be-
lieves in those rare classical
and human essentials. He ob-

a little theol- .

‘viously has something to pre-
serve’ and intends to preserve
it. Why should we not be proud
of our heritage? Why is. it treat-
ed in so slight a manner that
few will defend it?

Our heritage includes the
generations of preservation
brought about by a certain
dignity which obviously entails
a certain amount of race
consciousness—a consciousness
born out of human dignity and
pride ‘(this same pride which
distinguishes man from ani-
nialistic tendencies), rather than
scorn or prejudice. This does
not mean that we should not try
to help one another, nor does
it mean that a certain race
should not be given an oppor-
tunity to improve its culture
and standards.

CHAOTIC NEWNESS

I, too. do not intend to open
the race question. but the point
which. the editorial defended is
on. which has been enclosed
with this topic of equal educa-
tional opportunity, ete. It is
this tvne of extension and modi-
fication that the chaotie and
bind use of a new idea simply
for the sake of its newness
causes.

Why is it that’ inequality,
when admitted, is always con-
fined to virtual intangibles such
as mental capacity or physical
prowess and _ coordination?
There is a very ‘obvious in-
equality among men of all
races and colors, even among
our brothers.

LAYER OF MEDIOCRITY

I must admit that the cur-
rent trend in the United States
and even the world is to pull
down and prop up enough so
that all will be in one great
layer of mediocrity with a void
on either side. Yet, in spite of
this, there are those of us who
believe in absolutes enough to
emphasize the Editor’s point,
you cannot make equals out of
unequals. At least, you can't
to those who believe in certain

.intrinsie essentials and quali-

ties.
Henderson Rourk

O’CONNER SPEECH
MISUNDERSTOOD

Dear Editor:

Last week’s editorial (Subtle,
But There’) on Dr. O’Connor’s
chapel talk grossly missed his
entire point, it seems to me.

INNATE RIGHTS

Dr. O'Connor spoke of equali-
ty in the sense of the equal in-

nate rights of each individual,
regardless of race or class, to

be counted as a human per-
sonality and, more specifically,
he implied the Christian con-
cept that all men are children

of God and are therefore equal-
ly endowed by Him with dignity
and worth.

The editorial used the term
equality in its narrower mean-
ing. pointing out that there are
individual differences of ability
or talent. If the writer of the
editorial wishes to give up the
basic and broader definition of.
equality, he must reject his
Christian and democratic heri-
tage.

UNDERSTANDING FIRST

The editorial expressly states
that Dr. O’Connor advocated
mixing groups and cultures. He
pointed out that because of
modern transportation and com-
munication, thére will + neces-
sarily be more and more con-
tact between various groups
and races, but he included this
so that he could urge under-
standing between the different
races and cultures, not the mix-
ing of them.

Finally, it must be recog-
nized that the cultural prob-
lems of today have been caused
primarily because nations with
superior power have imposed
their wills upon weaker, less
developed peoples. The writer
bf the editorial failed to under-

stand that it is not these peo-

ple who are intruding on our
rights, but we who, for years,
have been intruding on theirs.

WORST WRITING

Not only I, but many others
on campus were shocked by
this editorial. In fact, it is one
of the worst pieces of writing
that I have seen in the DAVID-
SONIAN. -My sincere hope is
that this was just a temporary
misunderstanding, and that
such a mistake will not be made
in the future.

PROUD OF DAVIDSON

Art, Culture, Music

By WILLARD WOLFE

Every once-in-a-while some-
body sounds off about the ter-
rible state of culture here at
Davidson.

Of course this is unfair, but
it always makes me think of
a certain Eastern College I
visited last vacation. There, I
admit, the situation was bad.
It made me feel proud to be
from Davidson (which, as every-
body. knows, is the best college
in the South and almost as
good as Princeton).

1. V. TWEED

At this college nobody came
to concerts or lectures or
showed any educated interest
in the arts. I talked to a
typical student, a Mr. I. V.
Tweed. When I asked him why
nobody had any serious inter-
est in the arts, he shrugged
and replied very casually:
“Why mess with that rot? I
just don’t go for that kinda
stuff.”

ANTI-CULTURE

And it seemed that the whole
way of life at that college was
actually anti-cultural. Since it
was.a men’s college, everyone
worked very hard not to ap-
pear “long-hair.” Only a “freak”
student who didn’t fit into the
normal college-joe groove could
do that. Mr. Tweed curled his
lip knowingly, and very
“smoothly” exhaled his men-
thol-fresh smoke. No, they just
didn’t go for that kind of thing.

The few who brought real
cultural interests with them
either suppressed those inter-
ests, dropped them so_ they

could fit into the groove; or
else they kept them completely
to themselves,

and so. did

nothing to raise the level of
student taste.

It appeared that many stu-
dents who would have enjoyed
going to a concert or play
stayed away for fear of what
the other boys on the hall might
say. It wouldn't do to get out
of that groove, so they just
turned up the rock 'n roll a
little louder.

ECKBERG OR PICASSO?

And art? “Well, nobody nor-
mal would go for Picasso or
Cezanne or any of that modern
junk, but let me show you some
real dolis—a whole wall full
of Anita Eckberg in the nude!”

But it wasn’t just student
values that were anti-cultural.
There was a long tradition of
opposition to all the arts on
that campus. Over half of the
faculty had graduated from that
college back when they didn't
even try to have any cultural
life at all, so they failed to
see the importance of art.

CAMPUS APATHY

Instead of encouraging stu-
dents to go to the concerts and
plays (as they might have
done), most of the faculty, the
fraternities, and the general
campus opinion discouraged it.
Nobody ever really pushed a
concert or worked to drum up
an audience for a play. Even
the music department did
nothing to stimulate and edu-
cate general student body in-
terest in the arts. You just
didn't do that kind of thing.

It was good to get back to
the cultural capital of North
. Mecklenburg County and know
that this could never happen
in Davidson’s “way-above-aver-
age” student body.

COFFEE BREAK

Blunt,

But Here

By BOB JONES

Napoleon in George Orwell’s
“Animal Farm” sums up last
week's editorial “Subtle, But
There" in his dictum “All ani-
mals are equal, but some ani-
mals are more equal.than oth-
ers.”

The current shibboleth that
not even brothers sre aqual is
an equivocation of the term
“equal” which surely no one
would deny. But in the sense
that each man is an individual

who has a personality of un-

limited potential, on what ba-
sis is one to say that he is
“more equal than others?”

The assumption seems to be
that these who have been born
with an advantage have been
particularly chosen by God to
enjoy and maintain this ad-
vantage over others. Though
undoubtly many __ rationaliza-
tions for this logic are possible,
on the Day of Judgement many
people are going to be hard put
to be convincing.

However, Dr. O'Connor was

not extolling the justice of
equality. Hypersensitivity to

State

Jones

the race question clouds men's
minds so that any word about
the evolving world culture is
immediately branded as propa-
ganda for equalizing the races
—the idea of course is “subtle,
but there” nonetheless.

UNREALISTIC

In a sense Dr. O'Connor is
playing the role of a prophet
to our times. Today’s rapid
means of communication have
shrunk the globe to such a de-
gree that appeals to keep all
cultures “pure and true’ are
unrealistic (though it could be
argued they never were real-
istic). On this score his appeal
can be made to Americans on
the basis of nothing more noble
than enlightened self-interest.

° As a professor of history and

Philosophy at the nation’s out-
standing school in foreign af-
fairs, Dr. O'Connor was giving
his analysis of the cultural
Tevolution of our time. His call
for men to see the future con-
sequences in making present
decisions instead of worship-
Ping the benighted past is a
necessary word if America is
to have a significant influence
in the world of a hundred years
from now.

Interpreting this vision as a
slick method of raising the
rece question grossly misses
the point.

OR, FORD
By the resignation of Or.
Harold Ford, Davidson foses
one of her finest men. His
warm conscientiousness and
concern for each individual stu-
dent has made him one of the
most highly regarded profes-

sors on the faculty.

in class his interest in prac-
cal affairs and analysis of re-
cent developments have made
his courses valuable to those
genuinely interésted and will-
ing to do the necessary work.
In a broader area his contri-
butions to the Interdisciplinary
Seminar -have strengthened the
most promising adventure in
curriculum improvement at Da-
vidson.

in their two brief years at
Davidson, Dr. and Mrs. Ford
have made for themselves 2
distinctive place in the com-
munity that will remain un-
filled in their absence. It is
with a sense of real regret that
we extend our best wishes as

they leave Davidson.
