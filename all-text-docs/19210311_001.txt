Junior Sp

eaking Celebrated on Campus [Bill

by Unprecedented Round of Activities

Largest Namber of Visitors in Years Present for Oratorical Exercises of
Junior Class—Dramatic Club and Musical Organizations Add

Mauch to Pleasure of the Occasion—General Reception
Held in Gymnasium Saturday Night

Fair weather, fair maidens, well-delivered speeches, musical and
athletic attractions, and a splendid reception occupied the students and a
large number of visitors from last Friday through Sunday ,and marked
a new day in Junior Speaking on Wildcat Hill. Great credit is due the
officers and members of the Junior Class for the splendid way in which
they arranged and carried out the interesting plans.

Oratorical Exercises.

At 7:30 o’clock Friday night and again
at 10 o'clock Saturday morning eight
aspiring Juniors spoke in Shearer Hall
for the Junior Orator's medal. All the
other members of the Junior class had
been eliminated at the semi-finals held
several weeks ago.

According to the ancient custom the
exercises Friday night and Saturday
morning were opened with prayer. Dr.
J. W. Moore offered the invocation Fri-
day night and Dr. Wool of Charlotte on
Saturday morning. At the Friday night
hour a pleasing musical program served
to enliven the monotony, but for some
reason the orchestra was absent from
the morning exercises.

As yet the committee of judges has
made no announcement as to the medal
and “rep” winners. The committee has
promised that a complete list of the
awards will be available for. the next
issue of the “Davidsonian."

The consensus of opinion has it that
J.-C. Bailey of the Eumenean and J. H.
McKeithen of the Philanthropic made
the best speeches Saturday night. Bait-
ey spoke on “Home Ownership” and Mc-
Keithen on “Fallen Idols.” E. B. Me-
Gukin of the Eumenean speaking on
“The Greatest Man in the World,” con-
trary to all expectations, did not speak
on Woodrow Wilson but on “he who
serves.” The judges would not be amiss
if they favored him rather than one of
the men mentioned in the first instance.

It appears that G. N. Neel of the Phi-
lanthropic and J. P. Price of the Eu-
menean made the best speeches Satur-
day morning. Neel spoke on “The In-
evitable Choice,” while Price entertain-
ed with “The Wildkittens: a Type.”

In addition to those already mention-
ed the following men spoke: from the
Philanthropic Literary Society, J. I.
Knight on “The South as a Man Maker,”
W. K. McCain tickled the risabilities
with “From Rib to Ribbon,” W. W. Mc-
Leod thoughtfully discussed “The South
and the Black Veil,” L. A. Taylor on
“From the Chin Up,” J. C. Wool envis-
ioned “America and the World,” and L.
A. Wooten discussed “Visual Education.”
From the Eumenean Literary Society,
R. Bitzer on “Optimism,” C. E. Cunning-
ham preached a famitiar “Philosophy
of Life,” P. D. Miller eulogized “Wood-
tow Wilson: the Idea,” and J. M. Rich-
ards arraigned us as “A Nation of Fools.”

GLEE CLUB CONCERT.

One of the most enjoyable features of
Junior Speaking was the concert given
by the Davidson College Glee Club on
last Saturday afternoon.

The program consisted of 13 numbers
and was given in a pleasing manner.
Such popular selections as “Tell Me,
Little Gypsy,” “Broadway Rose,” “Dry
as a Camel’s Tonsil’s,” “Margie” and
“Our Castle of Dreams,” made a big hit
with the audience.

The “Wildcat” Jazz Orchestra turned
loose some jazzy harmony, full of pep
which caused even the oldest persons
present to sit up and pay attention.

Sugarfoot Gaffney and Lightnin’ Rod
Jones next appeared: on the scene of
action and held the attention of each
one present from the beginning to the
end of their dialogue.

Blaze in Phi Hall
Causes Excitement

Prompt Work of Stucents Saves An-
cient Building Fron Destruction
Mooresville Fire Truck
Brings Relief

Real “Fire” was on the campus last
Friday morning. The conflagration
did considerable damage to the roof and
eaves of the Philanthropic Literary Soci-
ety Hall. It is supposed to have started
from a defective flue in the French class-
room.

The whole student body, together with
the faculty, turned out to give their aid.
Ladders and fire-hose seemed to be non-
existant on the campus when they were
most needed. Some of the boys succeed-
ed in finding two ladders, however, and
with these and a few fire extinguishers,
they began to fight the increasing flames.
Later a bucket brigade was formed un-
til a fire hose was rushed up from one
of the mills.

Dr. Lingle proved to be the “coolest”
man in the crowd. While watching the
fire eat its way towards his class room,
he announced to the crowd that his
French II class would take the next
four pages. The three “fire-chiefs” were
Mr. Jackson, Dr. Arbuckld, and Dr. J.
M. McConnell. They proved to be ex-
Perts on giving directions on how to use
a fire-extinguisher.

A record run was made by the Moores-
ville fire department truck, but when
they arrived the students had already
extinguished the fiames.

DL
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF
INTERCOLLEGIATE PRESS
ASSOCIATION APPOINTED

President J. Eris Cagsell of the North
Carolina Intercollegiate Press Associa-
tion has appointed the following as the
executive committee, of which the First
Vice-President of the Association, Miss
Marie Edgerton, of the Salemite, is the
chairman, by virtue of the provision in
the Constitution that the First Vice-
President shalt be chairman of the exec-
utive committee. Daniel L. Grant, Editor,
of the Tar Heel, Claude F. Moser, Editor
of Trinity Chronicle, Miss Myrtle Wil-
liamson, Editor Queens Blues, Miss
Evelyn B. Brider, Editor Meridith
Acorn, and Miss Sadie Jenkins, Editor
of Greensboro College Magazine.

During the intermission, “Jap” Com-
ming entertained the audience by doing
several difficult stunts and also showed
his power of jui jitsu in knocking out
his stage helper.

The program was concluded by the
singing of “O Davidson,”. by the entire
club.

The concert was the best that has been
given this year which showed the re-
sults of thorough and careful training.

PLAY BY DRAMATIC CLUB.

The Dramatic Club of Davidson Col-

lege made its debut at Junior Speaking
(Continued on page 8)

Miley, Captain and
Twirler of 1921 Nine
Is Now Playing His Fourth Season
for Davidson
Great things are being looked forward
to from this season’s Wildcat nine, un-

| der the leadership of Captain Bill Miley.

This lad has tossed the old pill on Red
and Black teams for three years, and
will round out a quartet in this his
Senior year, if all goes well.

“Old Smiling Apple Plug” played in
the outfield his Fresh year, taking a
turn or two in the box also. His Soph
year found him on the regular twirling
staff, but a bad arm which developed in
mid-season kept him out of the fray

for the remaining games. Last year,
however, found the “Old War Horse” in
prime condition and heaving the apple,
with plenty of stuff on it. His most
notable feat was in the affair against
Elon, when he let the sluggers from the
Christian college down without a hit in
nine innings.

Bill handles himself with plenty of
form and puts out a rare brand of
pitching ability. He plays a steady and
cool game, and should make the Wild-
cats a capable leader.
SEVEN DAVIDSONIAN

REPORTERS AWARDED
THE GOLDEN QUILL

Seven members of the Reporters’ Club
were presented with the coveted golden
quill last Saturday night during the in-
termission of tie plays. Dr. Currie pre-
sented the quills with a short speech,
explaining the nature and purpose of
the Reporters’ Club and the difficulties
confronting one who would express
himself with the pen alone. He also ex-
plained that the golden quill is given
each year at Junior Speaking to certain
members of the Reporters’ Club who
have done the best work for the David-
sonian that year, the number receiving
the honor each year not to exceed seven.

Those receiving the quill were, A. M.
Mitchell, W. J. Cooper, A. D. King, A.
C. Ormond, J. C. Bailey, R. Bitzer, and
W A. Gamble. These seven men were
asked to come up in front of the rostrum
and each was given a golden quill with
the wish that they have the same success
in the future that they have already had.

Basketball Team Ends Successful
Season by Winning Two Games
Out of Three Last Week

Wofford and Winston “Y” Succumb to Wildcats’ Attack—Guilford

Strong On Their Home Court—Craw-

ford and L. Schenck Do Great Work for Red and Black

Guilford Game.

On the Guilford College floor last Wednesday night the Quaker
quintet nosed out the hard fighting Wildcat team for a 27-25 victory.
It was the last game of the season for Guilford and they played one of

the best games of the year.

Davidson Comes Third in
Race for State Bas-
ketball Honors

Bill Roberts and John Schenck Lead
in Scoring — Several Games
Lost by Close Margins

With the final blow of the referee's
whistle in the Winston “Y" game last
Friday night, the curtain was rung down
on this year’s basketball season. For
eight solid weeks of gruelling practice
and playing, the Wildcat quint has once
more placed the fair name of Davidson
among the worthies, and has set up a
record which does justice to its Alma
Mater.

Saturday night, Dr. J. M. Douglas
awarded the six players and managers,
with that coveted emblem of service,
commonly recognized as the “D.”" Those
to receive this honor were L. B. Schenck,
captain, D**; B. W. Romefelt, D*; W. W.
Roberts, D*; J. Schenck, D; C. R. Craw-
ford, D; C. M. Davis, D; S. W. Miley,
manager's D.

The team played 16 games during the
season, 11 of which were intercollegiate.
Five of these 11 were won, by scores
with plenty to spare. Of the six lost,
three were by scores of three points and
less, while the largest score rolled up
against the team was that of University
of Va., 47 to 23 victory.

The summary of the season looks as
follows:

Durham “Y” 41, Davidson 16.

Charlotte “Y" 32, Davidson 24.

Guilford 14, Davidson 51.

N. C. State 13, Davidson 45.

Un. of Va. 47, Davidson 23.

Elks Club 37, Davidson 23.

Washington and Lee 31, Davidson 28.

Elon 25, Davidson 38.

Un. of Fla. 26, Davidson 4s.

Elon 30, Davidson 19.

N. C. State 29, Davidson 28.

Un. of N. C. 37, Davidson 20.

Charlotte “Y” 11, Davidson 55.

Guilford 27, Davidson 25.

Wofford 34, Davidson 35.

Winston “Y” 25, Davidson 34.

Opponents 459; Davidson $09.

Bill Roberts, crack forward on the
quint, led the point scorers with a total
of 241 tallies. Bill is undoubtedly one
of the best forwards in the state and will
probably land an all-star berth.

Johnnie Schenck, with 104 points to
his credit is second on the list. His
chief contribution to the team was in
his lightning like floor work. Johnnie
is an able man on his feet and is a ter-
ror to the opposing offense.

Pat Crawford, husky guard was next
in line with 80 to his credit. This lad
was a bulwark of strength on the de-
fense, and his ability to get up the floor
for an open shot was remarkable.

Romeo Romefelt at center contribu-
ted so. He played a consistent and
agressive game and contributed greatly
on the defensive. Suffering an injury

It was a close contest throughout,
first one team taking the lead and then
the other. This advantage changed
hands nine times during the conflict.
Toward the end, until the last few
seconds the Quakers had a fair lead, but
the Presbyterians came back ahd were
caging the spheroid steadily until but
one scant goal separated the totals of
the two teams. Tle final whistle cut
short their desperate efforts and left
the score 27-26 for Guilford.

The outstanding work for the Wildcats
was done by Roberts and Schenck, while
the Frazier brothers performed in bril-
liant fashion for the. Quaker outfit.

Wofford Game.

In a rather slow and listless game the
Wildcats triumphed over the Wofford-
ites by one lone point on last Thursday
night. The Red and Black machine
overcame a handicap of six points in
the last half and during the closing
minutes of the game the “pep” which the
spectators had failed to deliver during
the first part of the game burst forth,
each team being exhorted by its sup-
porters to put the game on ice by shoot-
ing a field goal. However the game
passed into history with the score 35 to
34 in favor of the Presbyterians.

The followers of John Wesley started
the scoring when Hecklin tossed the
sphere through the hoop. When the
whistle blew for the end of the first
period the score board showed that
Wofford led 17 to 11. During the rest
period between the halves the old “Wild-
