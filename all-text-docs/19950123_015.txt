Crazy Cats

Crazy fans want more company

By Joe Beach
& Jason Burt

Welcome back to school,
hoops maniacs. We hope your
Christmas break was restful, ‘cause
nowit’s time to get CRAZY for the
‘Cats. Both teams have had their
troubles lately, but Monday, Janu-
ary 23 is your chance to come on
down and help them turn things
around in the second double hitter
of the season. The Lady Cats face
’ off against Georgia Southern at
6:30 p.m. and are immediately fol-
lowed by the men’s match-up
against Appalachian State. Also,
make plans now to attend the men’s
game against Marshall on Satur-
day, January 28. Show up in your
colors and wail like a banshee.

With the important informa-
tion out of the way, we’d like to
take a few paragraphs to cover two
important topics. First off, now is
the time to clarify the situation
concerning the seating in the Crazy
Cats section of Belk Arena. The
fundamental goal of this club is to
support the men’s and women’s
basketball teams. In order to
achieve this goal, we encourage all
Davidson students to attend home
basketball games. No one is, or
ever should be, excluded. Two
months ago many of you bought

club t-shirts. Part of the deal was
that you would receive preferred
seating in return for wearing the
shirt to home games. This deal has
not changed. There is one addi-
tion, however. Due to the fact that
these are prime seats (and it looks
really bad if there are not filled for
a game), you MUST arrive at the
game more than 10 minutes prior
to the scheduled start time in order
to guarantee that you will get a

ticket to this section. After this .

time, the tickets will be given to
any students on a first-come, first-
serve basis. If you are going toe
unavoidably late, please call either
Burt (-6827) or Joe (-6627) and a
ticket will be reserved for you.
The next subject is far more
important. We want to thank each
and every Davidson fan who
showed up and cheered their hearts
out at the Davidson-UNCC game
on December 17. Coach McKillop
told us after that game that Belk
Arenahad been turned into a “house
of horrors.” Only at the Southern
Conference finals last year have
we ever seen Davidson fans cheer
like that. Our challenge.to you, as
Davidson College students, is to
keep up the intensity. We have
spoken with many people who
openly doubt that you will. Come

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE STANDINGS

help us prove them wrong.

For some reason, Davidson
students have a reputation for be-
ing the lamest fans in the Southern
Conference. I have been to games
this year at ETSU and Furman, and
I was amazed. Nobody heckled,
there was no “here we go Pala-
dins” or “DE-FENSE!” cheers. In
short, they were lame. While at a
Harlem Globetrotters game in
Chapel Hill, I was able to speak
with current Globetrotter and

former ETSU stand-out Trazel Sil- _

vers. He told me that he remem-
bered me and my loud-mouthed
companion at Davidson games. He
could even remember some of our
more clever insults. Now if just
two people were able to get inside
the head of one of the Southern
Conference’s best, imagine what
an impact a crowd like the one we
had at the UNCC game will make.

As fans and students at
Davidson, we have an opportunity
to affect the game as it is played on
the court. By our presence and
noise, we encourage our team and
intimidate our opponents. By our
absence and silence, we embarrass
our team and energize our oppo-
nents. Join with us, and turn Belk
Arena into the Southern Confer-
ence ‘‘House of Horrors.”

Basketball earns 2-1 conference record

Men’s continued from page 14

clearly has the talent to do it. But
that effort has partially been slowed
by too many weapons, including
Quinn Harwood, George Spain and
the still-developing freshman Ray
Minlend.

“Tt’s one thing to have the
ability to do it, it’s another to have
the poise to do it,” McKillop said.
“It takes experience to doit.... It’s
a luxury to have four guys that you
know you can go to, but you need
consistency to develop that abil-
ity.”

Saturday, Williams, now al-
most fully recovered from an ankle
injury that forced him to sit out
three games over the break, threw
in 20 points to lead the team. But
it was Minlend that scored six
points during a key 8-0 second half

run to put some distance between
the Wildcats and VMI.

While recognizing that he was
expected to become the main man
on this squad, Williams takes the
team approach to the situation, say-
ing, “If it takes five points from me
or 25 points for us to win, I have to
accept that.”

What everyone hopes will be
another 13 out of 14 streak, or
better, continues tonight at home
against Appalachian State and Sat-
urday against Marshall. Davidson
is currently tied atop the Northern
Division of the Southern Confer-
ence with East Tennessee State
and Marshall, all with 2-1 records.
On Jan. 14, the Wildcats opened
conference play with an impres-
sive road win against ETSU.

So with the loss to Furman
perhaps serving as a wake-up call,

the team heads into the rest of the
league conference confident of its
ability.

Earlier in the week, Williams

said, “We’ll start a new season -

Saturday (against VMI). By the
end of the season, that one loss
we’ll look spectacular against 13
wins, and that’s what we’ re aiming
for.... We’ve had our lapse for the
season. Our focus is to come out
and dominate, not just play hard.
We think we can.

“You can never be happy los-
ing this many games. But what’s
to say we have to lose another
game? What’s to say we have to
have as good arecordas last year to
be a better team. We need to stop
making comparisons. I really think
that by the end of the season we’ll
be proud of what we’ve accom-
plished.”
