Flu wave sends students to infirmary
College Physician W.T. Williams said he has diagnosed 20 to

30 flu or flu-related cases daily at the infirmary Monday through

Wednesday of this week, “not an unusual number [of cases] for the

flu season.

“This {incidence of flu cases] seems to be in keeping with the
cases in the rest of the state and country,” Williams said. “In January
or February of every year,” he said, “we see usually a wave of flu.
This year’s started about two weeks ago; the largest number regis-
tered in the infirmary on Monday of this week.”

Williams characterized the disease as “the influenza you see
every winter.” He noted that Davidson's current cases generally in-
volve a two-day illness with average temperature of 101 degrees.
The rate of secondary infection (bronchitis, pneumonia, or other in-
fluenza caused sicknesses) is 10 percent or less, according to Wil-

“Whenever you have a flu epidemic, there is the possibility of
secondary infections, but the likelihood with this particular virus
seems to be lower than we have seen in times past,” Williams Said.

He cited a January 1981 flu outbreak during which the infirmary
diagnosed 300 new cases in a single day with average temperatures
of 102 to 104 degrees. During that outbreak, the Dean of Students’
office cancelled classes. Dean of Students Will Terry said there is no

set policy regarding cancelation,

but “We just go by the doctor's

Williams said, “The basic treatment (for flu) is supportive —lots
of fluids, as much rest as possible, antihistimines or decongestants.
An important thing is that it is strongly recommended that aspirin
not be used because of F.D.A. statements regarding its association

with Reye's

syndrome.” Willams suggested using an

acetominophen (a category including such brands as Tylenol) rather
than aspirin.

form a group, get some service
projects done, and then we'll
probably be given our charter by
the end of this year,” he said.

Dean of Students Will Terry
said the process to be followed by
the freshmen hoping to obtain a
house for the Kappa Sigma frater-
nity would involve a formal appli-
cation to the Council on Campus
and Religious Life. The council
would then make a recommenda-
tion to the president who would
make the ultimate decision. The
Business Office would also be re-
quired to make a recommenda-
tion.

Terry said Kappa Sigma will
not be one of the choices pre-
sented to freshmen when they
make their self-selection deci-
stons Sunday Feb. 9. “They will
not be a part of the self-selection
system,” he said. “They are really
only beginning to organize, and it
would be up to the Committee on
Campus and Religious Life
(CCRL) to decide that. or to ad-
vise me. I can cunceive that they
[the CCRL] would say ‘yes." I can
also conceive that the Kappa Sigs
would not be ready to move into a
house next fall, and would need a
period of self-selection to get
enough members.”

He said, “They at this point
have no status with the college.
They're just a group of people —
like those who wanted to start the
Spencer House last year.”

Spencer House was formed at
self-selection time last year. It
took over the house formerly oc-
cupied by Fannie & Mable, a de-
funct coed eating club which
folded last winter.

Terry said he cannot be sure
how the process will turn out for
the Kappa Sigma hopefuls:

“Those freshmen who are going to
cast their lot with trying to form a
new fraternity on campus are to be
commended for taking the risk
and turning down the opportunity
to join a house when there is a pos-
sibulity that the new house will not
be organized.”

Reese Boyd, a freshman inter-
ested in Kappa Sigma, expressed
his faith in his group's prospects:
“[ have all the confidence — from
the people that I"ve been around,
from the people that I’ ve talked to,
and just the comments that I’ve
heard — that Kappa Sigma will
materialize .~

He said, “It’s true that self-
selection will be something of a
day of reckoning for Kappa
Sigma. If everybody who shows
interest in Kappa Sigma backs out
and does pledge with another
fratemity then obviously it won't
happen. But I have a lot of confi-
dence im the guys that are a part of
the effort to form Kappa Sigma
that they're wholly committed to
the fraternity .~

Boyd said he definitely saw a

lot of support for Kappa Sigma
among freshmen males. and that
he believed in its eventual suc-
cess. “This year I think it’s going
to be a very slow process, but in
my sophomore year and the years
on down the road I foresee it be-
coming not only an integral part of
my life, but an integral past of Pat-
terson Court and the college com-
munity.”

He said Kappa Sigma’s
novelty was its most aftractive
point: “That's really the great
thing about Kappa Sigma — it’s
something new and it’s going to
be innovative, and it may be a
very exciting element, something

Committee screens Self-Selection

By MARGOT MIMS

Could moving the fraternities
off campus be the solution? This
question and others are being con-
sidered by the recently formed
Patterson Court Selection Study
Committee.

The 10-man committee, ac-
cording to chairman Dan Murrey,
“is looking for a system that will
be flexible enough to meet the
needs of both the freshmen and the
fraternities and eating houses, and
still remain in accordance with the
philosophy of the college.” He
said the ultimate goal of the com-
mittee is to make an honest sys-
tem. The committee is not con-
nected, however, with the already
established Self-Selection Com-
mittee.

According to Murrey, the pre-
sent system seems to “lack the
spirit” of self-selection that was
apparent in past years. Registrar

Libraries across the

You can visit these
libraries and use the

needs right now — a new, in-
vigorating force. I think it can be a
very exciting opportunity not only
for the people that are actually in-
volved, but for the other people on
Patterson Court, too.”

There is some concem, how-
ever, that a seventh Davidson
fraternity might continue an ap-
parent trend towards single-sex
eating. PAX President Janice
Evans said: “It’s something that
concerns me. There has been a de-
finite trend towards single-sex
eating during recent years; after
all, Spencer House was formed
because Warner Hall and Rusk
were bursting at the seams, and
it’s growing by leaps and bounds,
too.”

She said: “When I was a
freshman there were five coed eat-
ing houses. Now I'm a senior, and
there are only two — and one of
them is having serious problems. I
feel that Kappa Sigma could defi-
nitely take something from PAX,
and maybe from Emanon, too.
I'm glad to have had a chance to
be a part of coed eating at David-
son, and I'd be disappointed to see
it go.”

Evans also expressed concern
over the apparent lack of available
information conceming Kappa
Sigma: “I ask freshmen if they're
thinking about eating at PAX, and
they say, ‘well, there’s this Kappa
Sigma thing .. . .” I ask them if
theyre sure it'll get off the
ground. They say, ‘It’s already off
the ground.” I think it’s so far off
the ground that it’s up in the air,
nobody can find out anything
about it. I'm concermed for
freshmen males who might wind
up out in the cold if Kappa Sigma
falls through.”

Emanon President Gina Tnp~

Sue Ross, a member of the com-
mittee with a nine-year perspec-
tive, accounts this decrease in
spirit to possibly the result of
changing desires, the increase of
conservatism, or the shift toward
national student acceptance of
fraternities.

Freshman John McCauley be-
lieves that freshmen are being de-
ceived by the term self-selection.
He said, “Prepare people for what
they are really going to get, don’t
le to them.”

Ross said “we need to have
clear guidelines.” Any social in-
stitution which combines two an-
tithetical social pressures into one
system always creates tension and
pressure. She said she believes it
is worth the effort to provide the
students the opportunity to choose
where they eat.

“Technically the freshman has
freedom to choose a house,” said

lett said, “IT think the coed houses
would feel threatened by the ap-
pearance of another fraternity.

“I guess I would like to think
that there isn’t a need for another
fraternity on campus, and that the
people coming to Davidson could
fit into the court system as it exists
now. But the incoming freshmen
will, of course, be the people to
determine if we need a new frater-

nity.”

Terry said, “Yes, I do see this
{Kappa Sigma] as a move towards
segregation by gender on the
court, and it bothers me. I would
much like to see the maintenance
of the two coed eating houses this
year. I am very heartened by the
initiatives Emanon has taken this
year, for instance.”

He said he believes Patterson
Court should not necessarily be
the home of a static social system:
“There's always this hue and cry
about a house closing, and fears
about the system crumbling, and
voices of doom — my feeling is
that as long as it is not expensive,
that if we really want a social sys-
tem that is responsive to the needs
of the students we will continue to
see change on the court. And that
doesn’t bother me. We don’t have
to have a rigid social system that’s
never supposed to change.”

Of the question of whether or
not the Court “needs” a new
fraternity, Terry said, “I think that
is a very cogent question — one
that the CCRL will have to look
at. If the Kappa Sigs can really put
together a group of people who are
enthusiastic and can carry this
thing off, then maybe that says
there is a need.”

He said, “I think personally
that fraternities have many things
to offer, but they also have some

Dan Murrey, “but undemeath
there is a lot of pressure to prove
yourself.”

In addition to the radical op-
tion of no fraternities, some of the
committee's other options are 1)
strict self-selection, 2) a strict bid
system or 3) giving each house the
choice to operate under the self-
selection or bid system.

An open forum to be held Feb.
12 at 7:30 p.m. in the 900 Room
will provide the campus with
more options and disclose the re-
sults of the questionnaire concerm-
ing the self-selection system, just
distributed by the committee to all
freshmen. Committee members
said they hope that much student
input will be fostered conceming
the viability of self-selection and
bid system. Another question-
naire will be handed out to the en-
tire student body after the open
forum.

horrendous liabilities. They per-
petuate some good things, and
they perpetuate some things that
are highly undesirable.”

The status of the fraternity of
Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji), David-
son’s only off-campus fraternity,
also has some bearing upon the
move to bring back Kappa Sigma.
Fiji president Jim Kelley said.
“The reason why we left campus
was self-selection, because with
self-selection our __ national
wouldn't let us stay on campus
without a bid system. Now there's
been talk, at the same time all this
Kappa Sig business is going on,
that a bid system may be coming
back, that self-selection may be
thrown out, or that the houses may
have the option to either self-
select or use bids. Should the col-
lege go back to a bid system, then
we would be allowed to move
back on campus, and that is some-
thing that we believe we would
like to do.”

He said, “If Kappa Sig comes
along and occupies the ATO
house, and the campus does move
towards a bid system, then we're
kind of left without a house. We
think that this should be a very real
issue in the question of whether or
not the Kappa Sigs get a house in
the first place. They ought to wait
until this issue of bids is through.
If the college does get rid of self-
selection and we're stuck without
a house, I just don’t think that it
would be very fair since we've
been around and established for so
many years.”

Terry said, “I hadn’t the least
idea that the Fiji's wanted to come
back on campus. That is, of
Course, one of the things the
CCRL will have to consider.”

He said, “Whatever we de-
cide, someone will be unhappy.”
