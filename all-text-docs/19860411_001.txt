Women’s athletics trapped in classification

By EDWIN PAGE

Pending what coach Caroline
Brown called a “rubber stamp”
approval from the NCAA, David-
son’s women’s tennis team will be
moved up from Division III to Di-
vision I. sometime in the near fu-
ture. The move will make the
Lady Cats ineligible for the Divi-
sion III tournament and will cost
them a legitimate chance of be-
coming the national champions
again. They are currently ranked
number one in Division III.

The move to Division I oc-
curred after months of failed appe-
als on the part of Davidson, and
results from a misinterpretation of
an ambiguously worded NCAA
regulation.

The rule in question appears in
Bylaw 11 of the NCAA manual. It
states that “An institution desiring
to be a member of Division I shall
sponsor a minimum of six varsity
intercollegiate sports involving

all-male teams or mixed teams of —

males and females in Division I,
with such sponsorship based on
the provisions of Section 4 of this
article. An institution desiring to
be a member of Division I shall
sponsor a minimum of six varsity
intercollegiate sports involving
all-female teams effective Sep-
tember 1, 1986, with such spon-
sorship based on the provisions of
Section 4 of this article.”
Although the starting date is
listed as September |, 1986, in

order to be in compliance on that
date, all member schools must
meet these requirements in the
previous (1985-86) season.

However, Section 3 of Bylaw
10 states, in part, that “ta member
of Division I may petition to be
classified in Division II or Divi-
sion III in any one women’s
sport.” It is under this rule that the
women’s team has until now been
allowed to compete in Division
IIT.

It is here that the ambiguity
comes into play. While Bylaw 11
clearly states that all six male or
mixed teams must compete in Di-
vision I, that is never specifically
stated about the six women’s
sports. Section 4, to which this
Bylaw refers, is concerned mainly
with the number of games a team
must play, and it likewise never
specifically mentions participa-
tion in Division I in all women’s
sports as a requirement.

The NCAA allowed schools to
apply for a waiver before July 2 of
last year if they were not able to
field the minimum six women’s
teams this year. But Davidson
Athletic Director Christopher
Morris believed that women’s ten-
nis, playing in Division III, would
count as one of the six required in-
tercollegiate sports since the rule
never states anything to the con-
trary. Therefore Davidson listed
field hockey, indoor track, out-
door track (this distinction is al-

lowed by the NCAA), basketball,
cross-country, and tennis as the
required six sports.

Early in October, however,
Morris learned that neither basket-
ball nor tennis could be counted
toward the requirement. The bas-
ketball team had scheduled only
19 games, six short of the number
required in Section 4 of Bylaw 11.
The NCAA also asserted that
Bylaw 11 implied that all six play
in Division I, meaning that even
though women’s tennis was al-
lowed to play Division III by the
NCAA, they could not be consid-
ered one of the six.

At this point, Morris began to
pursue some alternatives. He and
women’s basketball coach Patty
Daley discussed the situation and
decided that it would be, in Mor-
ris’s words “educationally un-
sound and unwise” to put the team
through another season in the
mold of the previous two years
when Davidson compiled a record
of 1-43 on the court.

Instead, Davidson filed sev-
eral appeals. Because of the con-
fusion over the interpretation of
the rule, the college asked to be al-
lowed to submit the waiver even
though the July 2 deadline had
passed. Appeals were also sent
asking for varsity status to be ac-
corded to the women’s volleyball
team and asking that the minimum
game requirement be waived for
women’s basketball in light of

their recent history in Division I.

Throughout the appeals pro-
cess, Davidson kept in touch with
the NCAA, and there seemed to
be reason to hope. According to
President John Kuykendall, “At
each stage we had good hope of
success with substantial verbal en-
couragement from the people
making the decision. We had an-
ticipated a more sympathetic hear-
ing and we obviously didn’t get
it.”

mix-up
Morris, in his converstions

with the NCAA, learned that the
case was being presented to the
Executive Committee with “staff
sympathy,” but just over two
weeks ago, the school was in-
formed that its appeals had all
been denied.

If the school failed to meet
these minimum requirements, all
sports, both men’s and women's

SGA considers new representation bylaw

By JIM DILLON

A proposed amendment to the
Student Government Association
(SGA) bylaws which would
change representation in the stu-
dent senate from dormitories to
Patterson Court houses is in the
works, according to newly elected
SGA President Mark Sandy.

The change would mean that
each Patterson Court house and
Phi Gamma Delta would have one
representative to the senate, and
independent students would have
representatives according to the
number involved. Freshmen,
rather than having three at-large
representatives and three dorm

Inside

representatives, would have six
at-large representatives.

“Mainly, the advantage is an
improvement in representation
and communication,” Sandy said.
“It'd be a lot different to represent
a house than a dorm. In a dorm,
there is no reason why you should
know everybody. At a house, you
know people well, and you have a
lot of contact with them.”

Sandy said that having house
representatives will help in relay-
ing messages and determining stu-
dent opinion. “If there is an issue,
and we want to have some idea
how the student body feels about
it, we can ask these representa-

tives to discuss it some night or in
a house meeting,” Sandy said.
Sandy noted that the SGA will
continue to post minutes of each
meeting to insure that students
know of SGA activities.

In the long run, Sandy said he
hopes that all SGA elections could
occur in the spring so that tumover
of offices would occur at close to
the same time for at-large repre-
sentatives and for house represen-
tatives. Current policy has at-
large senators take office in the
spring and dorm senators in the
fall.

“Right now, half of the senate
has just changed, and the other

half won't change until the elec-
tions in the fall,” Sandy said.
“This would really help us in
terms of readjustment, but we
can’t do that this year.”

In order to take effect, the pro-
posal will have to receive majority
support from the current SGA
when a vote is taken Tuesday,
April 15. If it passes there, it will
require the approval of two-thirds
of students in a school-wide re-
ferendum and approval of the
Board of Trustees for the change
to come into effect. Sandy says he
hopes to complete a referendum
by the end of the month so the pro-
posal may be presented to the trus-

tees at their May | meeting.

Sandy said most SGA mem-
bers and others with whom he has
talked, including newly elected
Vice-President Vincent Knight,
are in support of the proposal, and
Sandy says he expects the propo-
sal to pass.

“Several people have spoken
at houses and to others, and thus
far we've had overwhelming sup-
port,” Sandy said.

If the proposal passes and be-
comes an amendment to the SGA
bylaws, elections to the senate in
the fall will be held by house and
not by dorm.
