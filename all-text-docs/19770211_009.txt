“It’s really different being
an international student over
there than over here. In Mar-
burg, we lived in University
operated student apartment
buildings. The housing guar-
antees contact with German
students. I was able to go into
some homes through my con-
tacts on my hall and travelled
quite a lot with my German
friends.”

Bob Bennett ’77 echoed
Tony’s sentiments, ‘‘I had
some romantic ideas about
seeing the world and I was
interested in going to Ger-
many after having had three
years of the language. I wan-
ted a different experience—I
had been thinking about going
for nearly four years.”

Bob also mentioned the
excellent living arrangements

European

and added these comments
about the city of Marburg:
‘The city is a big plus—it’s

. gorgeous and full of history.

It’s also in a central position in
the country which makes tra-
vel easy. There were also lots
of cultural offerings in Mar-
burg and in nearby cities.’

“‘Davidson students are
generally well thought of in
Marburg,’’ continued Tony.
“Also the professors seem to
understand that you are there
not only to study a specific
subject but to learn to under-
stand the whole cultural sys-
tem.”

Bob added, ‘‘You take cour-
ses on an equal basis with
German students. Actually
the course selection is quite
wide because after all it is a
university system. You can
take anything your German
can handle.”

Montpellier

France

“‘T went to France for the
wine, women, and sun,” said
Dick Hay ’77. ‘‘And because I
wanted to get away from
Davidson.”’

“‘T went because I knew it
would be a unique experience
and I wanted to live in Europe
rather than see it as a tourist,”’
said Steve Godar ’77.

“‘T went to learn more and
perfect my French. I always
heard that it was a really great
experience,’’ commented Bob
Currie ’'77. He continued, ‘‘It
is a real challenge to leave
home for a year and live and
travel in a different culture.
This way you get a close up

»veryone American tourists they saw in
Europe, Dave remarked, ‘‘I
Another can see why Europeans hate
greater Americans. The ones we saw
irts at a embarrassed us. They acted so
he pub- ignorant and disrespectful of
European culture.”’
ied with Linda added, ‘‘We all were
srences. determined not to appear like
finitely tourists. We didn’t and the
culture people opened up to us almost
immediately. They’re great
w young people.”’
compar- Linda summarized by prais-
da com- ing the foreign studies prog-
jus how ram. ‘‘The main lesson I
is been learned on this trip was that
u walk nothing expands a person
ope.. It’s more than exposure to differ-
awesome ent cultures and values. And I
\ part of applaud anything Davidson
rful feel- does to promote this expo-

tal of India.

!so pressed few complaints, al-

Castelein explained, ‘‘I live
down in the basement (Belk)
where there are a lot of Fiji’s,
and they took me out to the
Fiji house right away. I got to
kniow so many people in the
first few weeks.

“That was the frightening
thing about coming here, not
knowing anybody. But it
wasn’t just the Fiji’s, it was
all the people in general.”

Bhattal commented, ‘‘No
international student is ata
disadvantage, unless they
have a language problem. I
didn’t have one.”

Nishimura, however, says
he did have a big problem
learning our language.

‘Language education in Ja-
pan is very poor. There is no
conversation class. There are a
very few language labs.

“In English classes (in Ja-

pan), the teacher stresses
mainly grammar. This is not
suitable for ordinary life.”

In comparing the U.S. with
her native land, one of the
things which struck Pont was
the international news cover-
age. ‘‘I feel that the news
about the world is very poor
on the radio and the Charlotte
Observer, and more or less, all

_. over the U.S.”

I could talk for days and
days,’’ mused Bhattal on the
differences between India and
the U.S.

“One thing I feel strongly
about is that most Americans
don’t know how lucky they
are. They don’t make full use
of their facilities.

“They're also very indivi-
dualistic here; there’s not
much emphasis on coopera-
tion. It’s every man for him-
self.”’

feok at a culture— you don’t
get the same perspective when
you just travel.”’

Steve added, ‘‘It offers
something that Davidson
can’t about finding out about
yourself through experience—
things you just can’t learn
from a book.’”’ Both Bob and
Steve lived in apartments in
the town of Montpellier. Dick
lived in the country near the
town. All three agreed that the
biggest adjustment was get-
ting used to the language.

Steve said, ‘You learn the
hard way in a lot of backward
situations to deal with the
culture and interactions with
people.”

“The evaluation system for
academics is different. Your
credit is transferred here as
pass/fail. The workload is
relatively light, but after all it
is in French,” said Bob.

‘*You don’t have to keep
your nose in a book like you do
here sometimes,’’ added
Steve, ‘‘it’s more relaxed, but
there are more other things to
cope with.”

Norwich

England

“IT went to England because
I wanted to travel and I
wanted to experience a differ-
ent university system. I didn’t
particularly want to escape
from Davidson. I guess I’m
sort of a reluctant advent-
urer,’’ observed Sue Cunning-
ham ’77.

Sue spent two terms last
year studying at the Univer-
sity of East Anglia in Nor-
wich, England. ‘I felt likeea
freshman again. But after
three or four days it wasn't
bad. It’s a much bigger place
—you can’t expect to get to
know everybody.”

“T felt really comfortable in
the classroom,’’ she contin-
ued. ‘‘I think that the biggest
adjustments that I had to
make were social adjustments.
I had to get out and go places
to make friends. Social life
over there is more laid back.”

Sue lived in a dorm com-
plex. ‘‘My roommate for one
term was from Finland. There
was a central kitchen that
everyone on the hall used so it
was really nice to cook and eat
right there and talk to the
other people on the hall.’’

“Academically, the univer-
sity is very good. All, my
classes were seminars; there
were no survey courses,” she
said.

JYA
in
retrospect

Students from all the prog-
rams were highly enthusiastic.
Tony observed, ‘If you plan
from the beginning, a JYA
experience can only enhance a
grad school application.’’

Steve added, ‘‘It is not
impossible for science majors
—they should keep the option
open. It’s just a tremendous
experience for anyone!”’

Both the students that were
in France and Germany felt
that the Davidson program
was well-organized. The pres-
ence of a Resident Advisor in
both situations was, according
to the students, very helpful in
getting through red tape and
other matters of adjustment.

Another observation made
by students in all three coun-
tries concerned the students
they were associated with.
“Students at East Anglia
(England) were much more
politically aware. They have a
more keen sense of what is
really going on in the rest of
the world,’’ said Sue.

Bob (Currie) observed,
“There was much more social
unrest. There were always
strikes going on. The unions
are really strong and active
over there. Students are much
more politicized, too. People
were always handing out pam-
phlets and having rallies about
things. The political spectrum
is much wider.”’

Tony added, ‘‘It really im-
proves your own political aw-
areness. There is no apathy
like there is here.”

Coming back to Davidson is
the one thing that seems a
little hard for some students.
“You have to expect Davidson
to be different. You have
changed a lot in your year
away and your friends here

_ have changed,” said Tony.

“Coming back was kind of
like hitting a brick wall,” said
Dick. ‘‘I was really inspired to
be more candid and open, but
the atmosphere here just isn’t
the same.”

“TI get frustrated with the
homogeneous mentality here,
but you are forewarned that
senior year will be a bad year,”’
said Steve.

“The biggest problem I had,
was coming back into the
English language,’ laughed
Bob (Bennett). “I kept throw-
ing in German words so much
that my mother couldn’t un-
derstand me!”’
