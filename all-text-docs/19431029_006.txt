Page Six ; THE DAVIDSONIAN Friday, October 23, 1943

Our Team

by JOHN ASHE

Coach Gene McEver, with the
characteristic skill and-iniative, has
whipped into shape a_ scravping
Wildcat squad. This squad, which
is composed mainly of freshmen,
would be found in the grand stand
and not on,the gridiron during peace
time conditions. However, possess-
ed with patriotism for their college
and a determination to keep a foot-
ball team at Davidson, these men re-
ported for practice with a keen will
to learn. -——

Knowing that they lacked many of
the qualities that have been char-
acteristic of Davidson football
players in the past, they have work-
ed diligently and for long hours with
the hope that they could form a
football team that would lead every
Davidson man to be justly proud of
and to “Back the’ Cats.”
