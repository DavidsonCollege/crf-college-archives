Scandling Lands Mat
Program, ‘Study First’

By BILL LLOYD
Staff Writer

Trying to get wrestling team
captain John Scandling to talk
about himself is no easy mat-
ter. But getting the modest
142 pound Senior from Alexan-
dria, Va. to talk about the
wrestling team and other
wrestlers is quite a bit easier.

“The wrestling. program at
Davidson is definitely
designed for the student's
welfare and studies always
have presidence over prac-
tice,’ commented Scandling.

“I feel that the team has
been workiing a lot harder this
year than in the past few years
and hopefully this extra hard
work will show in the remain-
der of the season.”

As a reliable stalwart on the
Wildcat wrestling squad hard
work is nothing new to the pre-

varsity Scandling went 6-2 in
dual meets and ranked fourth

in the conference. Proving
that his early success was no
fluke he wrestled to a 7-1-1
record as a sophomore and
retained his conference stan-

ding.

“I was disappointed last
year because I got sick early
in the season and wound up
with a 1-2 record,” recalls
Scandling.

“Wrestling is as much a
mental sport as it is physical
sport. I have looked really
poor in some matches just
because I was not in the right
frame of mind.”

Scandling was by no means
a novice to wrestling when he
came to Davidson. His high
school finished first in the
district and fifth in the : state
while John was wrestling as a
Senior.

When asked about his im-
provement over the past four
years Scandling replied, ‘‘My
wrestling really hasn’t im-
proved a great deal. I am a lit-
tle ‘stronger, a little more
knowledgeable, and maybe a
little more confident. But for
the most «part I think that I
have . plateaued out since high
school.”

As a pre-med Scandling has
been forced to concentrate on
academics and sometimes
wrestling and class work have
clashed. ‘For the most part
my professors have been pret-
ty sympathetic when I ex-
plain the problems.

“In fact, some of the
professors used to wrestle
here themselves. Professors
Kelton, Bevan, and Walls all
wrestled while they were in
college. Dr. Walls was sup-
posed to be a real terror from
various stories that I have
heard around the gym,”

smiles Scandling.

Scandling’s future plans
consist of going to medical
school next year at the Univer-
sity of Virginia. “‘Next year
will be the first in eight years
that I have not wrestled.”’

Lady Wildcats Begin Season,

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Asst. Managing Editor

Although the Davidson
Wildkittens have only had one
opponent and lack a true big
woman, they have warmed
the cockles and stolen the
hearts of their audience with
an excellent and yet unique
brand of basketball.

The team has come a long
way under the tutledge of Joe
Duncan and the determined
coaching of Ann Holland.

“You could tell a big dif-
ference between this week and
last week in the team. We
must get to know each other as
players a little more though,”
said spicy guard Sally Bon-
durant.

‘Something that surprised
me,”’ she added, ‘‘was the way
that they gave us money. They
gave us a thousand dollars as
soon as it was sure that we
were a team. I had to sell
doughnuts for seven years to
get new uniforms in high
school.”’

Becoming a team was dif-
ficult and finding a coach a
near impossibility.

‘I thought that you could get
P.E. credit for having played
a varsity sport in high
school.” said freshman back-
court player Laurie Dunn, ‘‘So
I said I played basketball in
high school. They looked at me
like they were saying ‘So
what?’ . I felt like a fool.

“Sally and I really wanted
to have a team and we took
Terry Holland seriously when
he asked us if we wanted to

- play. He wanted us to try out

for the boy’s Jr. Varsity so
that he could get some free
publicity, I think.”

Dunn and Bondurant proved
to Terry Holland that there
were a significant number of
girls interested in forming a
serious and competitive team.
As the story goes, Ann Holland
was made coach and Joe Dun-
can was made advisor or
assistant coach.

“I don’t think he had much
choice about it,’’ said Becka
Stimson, another freshman
basketballer. ‘‘Joe has a lot of
patience, and he is forced to
use it with us.”

“Joe. has all the patience in
the world.’’ echoed Dunn.

“The team counts its unity
and ‘Character’ as its strong
points. We care about each
other and out there and it is
only a matter of getting to
know one another as team-
mates before we are a really
good team,’’ said Katherine
Morton, the team hotshot.
According to Morton, the

team’s weakness is defense.
‘“‘We do pretty well on of-
fense,’’ she said in retrospect.

The Ladycats have been
met with wide support from
the student body. Very few
girls’ teams, even those that
are firmly established at their
respective schools have the
firm audience support that the
‘Catettes’ have received.

“At first some people
seemed to be laughing at us
and not taking us seriously at
all. We do not want to be just a
preliminary for the boy's
games. We are serious and we
would like to be considered as
such,’’ preached Bondurant.

“‘I think that we have proven
the skeptics wrong and have
earned a little respect of our
own,”’ Morton added.

“This school is basketball
oriented and the new co-ed

thing has helped us out a lot
with our attendance. The real
test will be tonight when we
play without being followed by
the boys. If the people come
out, we will feel that we have
the respect that we want,”
said Morton.

When pressed a little fur-
ther, Morton added, ‘‘What do
you want me to say, the guys
come out because we are pret-

had

The girls employ a 2-1-2 zone
defense, designed to stop the
easy shot. This defense is
reliant on quickness which,
according to Dunn, is missing.

‘What we need ideally is a
quick Wilt Chamberlain or a
Jerry West,’’ said Dunn.
Preferably with a voice high
enough and a length of the
court trot interesting enough
af keep ‘‘that co-ed thing’’
