Police Try To Link Gainesville killings, no charges

Gainesville Suspect To have been filed against him in ei-

Louisiana Triple Murder
TAMPA, Fla. (CPS) - The chief
suspect in the killings of five stu-
dents in Gainesville may face three
murder charges in his hometown
in Louisiana, according to a po-
lice affidavit.

The affidavit from Shreveport,
La., police was filed in support of
a search warrant to obtain saliva,
blood and hair samples from
Danny Harold Rolling, 37.

Shreveport police say the
samples may link Rolling to the
1989 triple-murder of Julie Gris-
som, 24; her father Tom, 55; and
her nephew Sean, 8. They believe
Julie Grissom was the target, but
her father and nephew also were
stabbed to death when they walked
in on the killing.

The affidavit’s release came
Aug. 26 as Rolling faced jury se-
lection for his robbery trial in
Tampa, where sheriff's deputies
said Rolling held up a grocery
store then led them on achase and
subsequent shootout. On Aug.
29, a jury convicted Rolling of
robbery, attempted and aggravated
assault on police,

The Tampa robbery charges
camea few daysafter police found
the bodies in Gainesville in Au-
gust 1990, but they are unrelated
to the student murders. Still, in-
vestigators say the Tampa con-
viction could help connect Roll-
ing to the murders because the car

Dr. Gregory Pence, a medical
ethicist from the University of
Alabama Medical School, spoke
to Davidson Medical Humanities
Students on Thursday about the
controversial 1975 Kenneth Ede-
lin abortion case. Dr. Pence told
students that he had originally
avoided “situational ethics”, pre-
ferring to study medical ethics from
a philosophical standpoint. How-
ever, he said that he learned that he
had to pay more attention to indi-
vidual cases after spending time
doing rounds in a hospital.

Dr. Pence urged the Medical
Humanities students to ponder
these cases at college while they
have the luxury of time. In telling
the story of Kenneth Edelin, Dr.
Pence said that he- especially
wanted to convey the burden of
decision placed on young residents
at large hospitals.

Dr. Pence related the case in
which Kenneth Edelin, a ‘young
resident at Boston City Hospital,
was brought before a grand jury on
manslaughter charges after per-
forming an abortion on Alice Roe.
Alice Roe (not herreal name) went

to Boston City Hospital for an
abortion when she was about 28
weeks pregnant, but because of the
unusual position of the fetus, a
regular abortion would threaten the
mother’s life and a hysterotomy
was deemed necessary.

The controversy arose when
Enrique Geminez, another resident
atthe hospital, reported that Edelin
opened up the woman, saw the live
fetus, then stared at the clock for
two minutes instead of trying to
induce self respiration. The ability
to breathe independently is used
by the government to define life,
so Geminez went to the District
Attorney and had Edelin brought
up on a charge of murder.

A grand jury convicted Ken-
neth Edelin of manslaughter in
1975, but he appealed the decision
and appeared before the Massa-
chusetts Supreme Court two years
later.

In the first trial, the judge told
the jury that there were two perti-
nent laws to the case. Under
Massachusetts law, a fetus becomes
a person only when it comes out of
the womb, and since Alice Roe’s
baby never came out of the womb,

itnever qualified asa person. Since
a manslaughter charge cannot be
brought up when a person is not
involved, many people thought that
the jury’s conviction was racist,
since Kenneth Edelin was black.

The Kenneth Edelin case was
avery highly charged casein 1977,
notlong after Roe v. Wade. Of the
seven judges serving on the Mas-
sachusetts Supreme Court bench,
four asked to be removed from the
case because the evidence was so
confusing and controversial. Even
Enrique Geminez’s testimony was
refuted in court by nurses who
said that he had not been standing
near Edelin, but in fact was outside
the door.

Kenneth Edelin was acquitted
in 1977 because of the Supreme
Court judges who asked to be
removed from the case. He is now
a practicing doctor in the Boston
area.

Dr. Pence isa 1970 graduate of
the College of William and Mary.
He received his Ph.D. from New
York University in 1974, after
which he taught in the New York
area before going to teach philoso-
phy at the University of Alabama.
