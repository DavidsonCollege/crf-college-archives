Are Student Desires Considered?

AN ANALYSIS
By TODD EADES
Staff Writer

The initiation of comprehen-
sive fee has given rise to sev-
eral questions regarding the op-
erations of the college.

Just what is the policy of the
college concerning student so-
cial programs and what weight
do student interests and desires
have in the formulaiton of these
policies?

If one is to assume the most
recently dated policy is official
and binding, what is one to
think about previous and some-
what contradictory policy state-
ments?

The comprehensive fee states
that ‘‘all students will be re-
quired to room and board on
campus unless officially ex-
cused by the college.”

This is meant to mean no
more eating in town and even
some students living off cam-
pus will be required to eat on
campus.

Almost all students will eat
on Patterson Court next year,
either in a social house or in
one of the three ARA operated
houses. This effectively removes
all alternatives except these
two.

The Committee of Eighteen
Report, which is now one year
old, states that a student ‘‘may
remove himself from the Pat-
terson Court Social Program at
the end of any term.”

Under the comprehensive fee
a student who leaves a_ social
house would only eat in one of
the ARA houses and thus would
have little opportunity to change
his social life.

The May, 1971 statement of
the Trustees on Section VII of
the Trustee Social System Po-
licy states that ‘‘the Board re-

cognizes and affirms the pre-
sent practice of each individual
student after his freshman year
being able, with college con-
curance, to eat where he de-
sires.”

The comprehensive fee, with
its limited exceptions and lack
of viable alternatives, seems to
directly contradict the spirit of
the trustee’s statement that a
student should be allowed to
eat where he desires.

The comprehensive fee will
include board fee for all stu-
dents eating on the court, even
in the new social houses. But
the Committee of Eighteen Re-

Che

Vol. LXI No. Eight

port explicitly states that ‘‘the

‘college shall not serve as a col-

lection agency but shall aid in
collection should payment ‘be
outstanding beyond a certain
time or above a certain
amount. .. .” ;

Is the Committee Report,
which is college policy concern-
ing the new social system, sup-
erseded by the initiation of the
comprehensive fee, and if so
for what reasons?

It is recognized that the col-
lege can alter policy, but are
student interests taken into ac-
count when this is done?

The Spencer Commission Re-

port on Coeducation advised
that ‘Davidson will have to...
make sure that no one way of
life is forced upon everyone.
It would seem to be the re-
sponsibility of the college these
days to provide alternatives
and not one way for all.” Yet
the comprehensive fee will re-
duce alternatives for students
for alleged financial considera-
tions.

The student senate voted 15-3-
1 that board not be included in
the comprehensive fee, with all
of the three negatives votes be-
ing cast as a protest against
the entire comprehensive fee.

Davidson College, Davidson, N. C. 28036

One would hope the adminis-
tration would want to.review a
decision that 18 senators voted
against.

The question is only now, post
facto, going before the Student
Life committee. Shouldn’t a
question which affects student
social life have gone before this
committee before decisions
were made?

How important is it to the
college that an individual stu-
dent be allowed to develop his
own social life? This question
needs to be answered and sup-
ported by the policies and ac-
tions of the college.

Student Body Approves NSA Affiliation;
Candidates Sparse In RHC Election

By DAVID HANIG
News Editor

The affiliation of the SGA
with the National Student As-
sociation was approved by the
student body, and RHC repre-
sentatives were elected in ev-

ery dormitory except Belk
on Tuesday.
Approximately 384 students,

or 59 per cent of those voting.
approved the student senate’s
decision to affiliate with the

NSA, whereas 261, or 40 per
cent, voted to overturn the sen-
ate’s action.

To reverse the senate’s ac-
tion, two-thirds of the student
body had to vote ‘no’; however,
only 63 per cent of the student
body voted.

“TIT am pleased with the way
the vote turned out.’ said SGA
President Danny Clodfelter. ‘I
think we have got to take full
advantage of our membership,
though.”

New Library Facade Asked

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Asst. Managing Editor

In a Wednesday _ evening
meeting in Greensboro, the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Board
of Trustees, members of the
Library Planning Committee,
and architects for Davidson’s
proposed new E. H. Little Li-
brary met to discuss changes
in the exterior design of the
new building.

Last week, the trustees voted
to request new facade designs
for the $4 million structure to
be built behind Chambers Buiild-
ing.

The architects were asked to
submit three new plans at a
November 17 meeting of the
same. group. The three new

DAVIDSON
. . « Library Director

plans requested were a similar
plan with some modifications,
4 new plan in the same arch-
itectural style, and a_ plan
which reflects twentieth century
architecture.

The trustees reminded the Li
brary Planning Committee,
which is chaired by Director of
the Library Chalmers David-
son, that their work is only
in an advisory capacity, and
that the final decision on the
library design lies with the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Board
of Trustees.

According to Davidson, no
member of the library commit-
tee was so “100 per cent for
those (proposed) plans that they
didn’t want them to be re-stu-
died.”

No member of the committee,
which is composed of Davidson,
Leland Park, assistant director
of the library, Professor Mal-
colm Lester, the Vice-Presidents
of Finance and Development
and Academic Affairs, and Di-
rector of the Physical Plant
Grover Meetze, was reportedly
overly upset over the —“rejec-
tion,” suggested Davidson.

The location of the new li-
brary, which necessitates demo-
lition of the present David
Ovens College Union, has drawn
the ire of Earl McCormick
of the Philosophy Department,
among others. The cost of the
library is increased by the de-

struction of a multi-million dol-
lar building for the construc-
tion of a more costly building.

The final decision on the ex-
terior design of the library
should be made at that Novem-
ber 17 meeting by the mem-
bers of the Executive Commit-
tee of the Trustees.

Senior Bob Morey, a prom-
inent member of the Stop-NSA
Movement on campus, said,
“Naturally, I am disappointed
that we did not win our case.
I think that the defeat was
caused partly by the lack of
knowledge on the part of the
student body of what the feud
was all about.

“Our strongest suit is that
the pro-NSA people will have
to produce. I personally feel
that they will have problems
because it is hard to deliver
the undeliverable,” Morey said.

In the Residence Hall Coun-
cil elections, representatives
from Little, Watts, Cannon, and
Richardson were elected with-
out opposition. East and West
Belk did not select their repre-
sentatives because nobody in
those two wings registered for
the election.

According to Bill Lear, Chair-
man of the SGA Elections Com-

mittee, SGA Vice President and
RHC Presdient Bill Alexander
will decide the mode of selec-
tion for the two representatives.
“There will be no more elec-
tions,” Lear said.

Elected Tuesday were David
Faison, Duke; Rich Love, Sen-
telle; Thomas Parks, Cannon;
Ricky Deal, Watts; Tommy
Ross, Little; and Rob Strand,
Richardson. In a run-off elec-
tion Wednesday, Bob Cunning-
ham was elected as Center
Belk’s representative on the
RHC.

Student leaders, however,
maintain that the lack of in-
terest concerning the RHC
among the student body is proof
that the RHC is sinking in its
value to the college.

“That so few students ever
bothered to run for the office
is an indication that the RHC
should be abolished,”’ said one
student.

Faculty Scheduled To Vote
On 3 Amendments Tuesday

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

The faculty will confront some
controversial issues Tuesday
when they vote on open faculty
meetings, the co-curricular com-
mittee and student membership
on two faculty committees.

The open faculty proposal
will come up for its first read-
ing Tuesday. Last spring the
faculty directed the Executive
Committee to draft a proposal
based on the student govern-
ment’s plan which would make
15 seats available to any mem-
ber of the student body.

The, student government pro-
posed that these students would
have floor privileges but no
vote. Under this plan the facul-
ty may close its meeting by a

three-fourth vote of those pre-
sent.

Since this proposal would be
an amendment to the Faculty
Constitution, it must pass the
first reading Tuesday by a ma-
jority vote and the second read-
ing by a three-fourths vote.

An open meeting on open fa-
culty meetings was held Sept.
28.

Also at Tuesday’s meeting.
the faculty will vote on the first

reading of the Co-Curricular .

Education Board, another pro-
posed amendment to the Fa-
culty Constitution.

The board would plan, coordi- °

nate afd implement all cam-
pus programs of public lectures,
art presentations, and special
events such as big weekends.
The board would be composed

of six faculty members, four
administrators, and seven stu-
dent members. Director of the
Union C. Shaw Smith would
chair the committee.

The faculty will also vote on
the second reading of the pro-
posals for student representa-
tion on the Faculty Admissions
Committee and the Faculty
Budget, Building and Grounds
Committee.

Also a constitutional amend-
ment, these proposals must pass
by a three-fourths majority and
then be endorsed by the trus-
tees before they go into effect.

The vote on the Admissions
Committee proposal on first
reading was 51-29. The vote on
the Budget, Building and
Grounds Committee proposal
was 42-33 on first reading.
