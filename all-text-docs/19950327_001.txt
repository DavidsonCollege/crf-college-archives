By SARAH TEACHWORTH

In recent months, members of
the Davidson College community
have voiced concern about the ef-
fectiveness of the Honor Code. The
ad hoc committee that was formed
last fall to evaluate the system as a
whole reported its findings to the
SGA‘ last Tuesday.

Some students say that many
professors would like to see
Patterson Court eliminated. Is this
true? Each professor has a differ-

ent opinion.
“There are wonderful people

in and out of the houses,” says
History Professor Ralph Levering.
“T tend to judge people individu-
ally.”

“The extent to which Patterson
Court is a dominant force on cam-
pus seems to be a matter of some
concern,” says History Professor
John Wertheimer. “I hear about
service and that seems good, and I
hear about abuses and that does not
seem good. In the classroom I treat
people individually. I would not
shed one tear if the whole thing fell
apart, but I don’t shed many tears
now. It doesn’t really matter to
me.”

The Mission

Former SGA President Eric
Rosenbach orchestrated the for-
mation of the committee last Octo-
ber. He planned for the group to
consist of both SGA and Honor

Council members. :
With this in mind, he ap-
pointed Sophomore Class Presi-
dent Warren Buford and Honor
Council Chairman Arthur Gaston

to co-chair the committee. Addi-
tional members of the SGA and
Honor Council were appointed to
thecommittee, as well as twomem-
bers of the student body at large.
Together, they set out not only to
evaluate the effectiveness of the
Honor System but to identify and
recommend solutions for its weak-
nesses. :

According to the committee’s

report, the “investigation makes
noclaim to being a scientific study,
nor did we intend it tobe.” Instead,
they chose to gather individual
opinions informally from students,
faculty, and staff.

Over a five month period, the
committee met approximately ev-
ery two or three weeks to share and
compare their findings with each
other. They then compiled their

prevalence on campus

information into a six page report
and distributed it at the March 21
SGA meeting.

Gaston says, “I’m very pleased
with our results. I think we did
what we set out to do. We wanted
in-depth responses, and that’s what
we got.”

Policeman Rick Moore says,

We talked about their concerns
