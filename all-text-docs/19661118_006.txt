YRC Speaker Explains
Republican Victories

Dick Barnwell, defeated Re-
publican candidate for Congress
in the Sixth District, spoke to
the Davidson Young Republicans
Wednesday n‘ght on the outcome
bf the election and the future of
the GOP in North Carolina.

Baruwell, who was defeated
by incumbent Horace Kornegay
by less than 2200 votes in the
elect'on. pointed to the signifi-
cant -afect on future legistation
due to the Republican victories
on the naticnal level as well as
in North Carolina.

The Republican gains, said
Barnwell, were due to the fact

ww

that the electorate ‘was fed up
with federal and Great Society
encroachment on things like
property rights.” He called the
northern liberals leaders agaast
the present civil rights move-
ment because of their leadership
and support of legislation which
has resulted in property en-
croachment and the breakdown
of law and order as illustrated
by the recent riots.

Other reasons for the Repub-
lican gains were a protest
against the rising cost of living
and the present administration's
use of a ‘‘no-win policy’ in Viet
Nam, cited Barnwell.

Barnwell said that there were
problems in North Carolina for
the GOP but that great strides
had been made as the result of
the last election. Newly-won
gains in county and municipal
elections and additional seats in
the legislature plus the electicn
of James Gardner to the U.S.
Congress give the North Caro-
lina Republican Party a broad
base for the future.

Barnwell graduated from Da-
vidson and is a former president
of the Davidson Beta Theta Pi
chapter. While here he roomed
with Dr. Samuel D. Maloney.
Professor of Religion.

Regulations Board Demands

By BOB DUNHAM
Staff Writer

“We are seeking the, coopera-

‘Ition of the student body in our

effort to stop this needless de-
struction of property.”

So spoke Paul Marion, chair-
man of the Student Regulaticas
Board, in reference to the re-
moval and abuse of fire extin-

~~] guishers from dormitory halls.

This problem, according to
Marion, is the prime concern of
the board at this time. Although
it is considering other violations
of student regulaticns, the board
wishes to correct this problem
before it becomes more serious.

Marion pointed out that.there
have been increased incidents of
burnings in the halls this semes-
ter. This coupled with the re-

Imoval of the extinyuishers pre-

sents a dangerous situation.
‘The Davidsca Fire Depart-
‘ment is on a volunteer basis:
consequently, any fire which
might break out/on camipus could
possibly spread out of control

[before equipment reached the

scene 0: the fire. The extinguish-
ers offer the: only prevention
aga‘ost such an occurrence.”

“The chance of a serious fire
breaking out is slim,” he said.
but he added, “it is best to play
it safe, and be prepared for the
improbable.”

Marion stated that the investi-
gation. committee for the Stu-
dent. Regulations Board has

checked into the repeated abusé
and removal of the extinguish-.
ers, but that they have received
little cooperation from the rest
of the students.

To stop the problem the com-
mittee plans to select people cn
each hall to report any missing
extinguishers and to prevent fur-
ther removal or abuse.

In addition. Marion stated that

Mrs. Peter Nicholls, supervisor
of dormitories, will -bill individ-
ual residents on each hall in
which damage occurs.

He pointed out that tampering
with the extingiushers and/or
burning in the halls are student
regulations violations and will
be treated as such, under the
regulation concerning destruc-
tion of property.

Stewart Seeks Action
By Church For Negro

Churchmen who have too long
neglected their duty to the Ne-
groes and the poor must now
take over at the saturation point
of anti-poverty laws and civil
rights laws, accord:ng to yester-
day's chapel speaker, the Rev.
Bill Stewert.

Because it is o'ten the incom-
ing freshman’s first introduction
to what Davidson is “really”
like. it is important that the
Witdeat Handbook be of the
highest possible quality. It must
inform the freshman about what
is, expected of him in all areas
of campus life. In short, the
purpose of the Handbook is to
facilizate the adjustment of the
incoming student.

The first prerequisite for a
good Handbook is accurate copy.
The Student-Body Ccenstitution
and Faculty Regulations must
be brought up to date and the
more important points clarified.
In this regard, I would reprint.
as a section of the Handbook,
the Honor Court's pamphlet on
the Davidson honor system. This
pamphlet. which ‘acludes a
br:ef history of the honor sys-
tem and explicit definitions of
honor offenses, would thus be
ava‘lable to all students in a
bookle: which is more likely to
be’ read and kept.

The copy should also include
‘a revised list of faculty address-
es and phone numbers, an im-
proved map of Charlotte, show-
ing the most direct route to
Queens, and a corrected list ‘of
the dorm phones of girls’ schools
in the immediate area. The so-
cial life section should include a

description of places to go and
things to do in Charlotte (res-
taurants, clubs, theaters, etc.)
and what the freshman can ex-
pect to spend where. Informa-
tion concerning car rentals and
approved places to keep girls on
dance weekends should be pro-
vided.

The °67 Handbook might well
give a more extensive descrip-
tion of activities open to fresh-
men through the College Union
and the intramural athletic pro-
gram.

An additional section concern-
ing academics would be imme-
diately helpful to the freshmen.
In working as a hall counselor,
I discovered that one of the most
pressng problems facing the
new student is that o" course se-
lect‘on, especially with regard to
the language requirement. A de-
scription of the course options
open to the freshman would at
least allow him to give this
important area some considera-
tion before he reaches campus.

Because the ‘66 Handbook
costs approximately $600 less
than its prescribed budget, it is
safe to assume that the ‘67
Handbook could be greatly en-
larged in scope with regard to
size and content, number of pic-
tures, and cover printing. These
suggestions are indicative of my
desire to make the Wildcat
Handbook a publication of the
highest quality.

The Wildcat Handbook present-
ly stands as an adequate guide
to the tangible aspects of David.
son—the administration, regula-
tions and sports. for example.

However, there should be
clearer presentation of the in-
tangibles of Davidson, stating
how Davidson lives up to its
reputation as a “small, liberal
arts college.” how its social op-
portunities can be utilized and
how Davidson compares with
other schools in its general at-
mosphere and outlook.

I believe that the Handbook
should present the explanations
for the present situation at Da-
vidson, so the freshmen can re-
alize before they get here what
awaits them.

Instead of stating that David-
son is a church-related ‘astitu-
tion, the Handbook should first
answer whether Davidson real-
istically is church-centered.

Cencerning academics, the
Handbook should investigate the
current course evaluation study
of the faculty and the Studeut
Council. Also, there should be a
look at the academic require-
ments, relating to their effect on
graduate school entrance, trans-
fer requirements, and major re-
quirements.

There could be a section on
fraternities that aot only men-
tions what fraternities have
chapters at Davidson, but also
points to the role of fraternities
—whether that role is changing
and, if so, in what direction.

In these ways I feel that the
undercurrents causing a_ turn-
about in the traditional David-
son atmosphere could be better
explained to the incoming fresh-
man before he arrives on cam-
pus.

There are a number of specific
changes I would like to see in
the Handbook. Since the fresh-
men are on their own first se-

mester, a fold-out map of Char-
lotte should be included, con-
taining a marked route to
Queens, plus locating the Coli-
seum, Memorial Stadium and
several restaurants and night
clubs where Davidscn students
gather. A map of North Caro-
lina with the major schools pin-
pointed could also be added.
Phone numbers of girls’
durms should be placed in one
section, marking the numbers of

‘freshmen dorms and listing the

phone rates to the various
schools.

If the administration could as-
sign room numbers earlier in the
year, I would like to add room
numbers below each Davidson
freshman's picture to aid in
rush.

The format and layout of last
year's Handbook was excellent.
and I would therefore not alter
the general presentaticn. Basic-
ly. what I hope to accomplish
would be in stressing a chal-
lenge to the incoming class of
1971 to improve upon the exist-
ing situations.

enue Presbyterian Church in
Charlotte, based his talk on. the
Belmont Park«area in Charlotte.
which has been infiltrated by Ne-
groes to such an extent that
whites are moving out as fast
as Negroes move in.

The cause of this problem
both here and in the Piedmont
Court area is. ‘according to Mr.
Stewart. “the white power struc-
ture in Charlotte.” He went on
to say that there are three main

types of segregation in Char-
lotte, economic, geographical,
and racial.

Stewart went on to say that!
the youth had begun to lose hope
in the possibil‘ty of changing the
present structure because soci-
ety is now just a means by which
men use each other. The pres-
ent structure of society is “dog
eat dog (in which) the survivor
gets the top of the totem pole.”

The fcaction of the church is
now vo provide a chance for re-
ligious, economic, and soc’al in-
volvement in society for the un-
derprivileged. Our middle class
church, though, “doesn’t know
these people, (and) they don't
trust us.”

Stewart believes that what is
needed is church-state coopera-
tion, despite the fact that this
would violate the principle of
separation between church and
state. This principle. Stewart
claims, has been a “factor in
continuing segregation.”

In a coffee ‘hour in the union
after chapel, Stewart went on to
say that he has seen “inactivity
in the past two years in the Ne-
gro community” and has come

He claimed that the ‘‘civil

cause it no‘longer deals with

ord and wins over Navy, M

Johnston and Jim Cooley fin-

Georgia and over two different

William and Mary went down as
a loss and kept them from also
breaking even.

Emory University assumed the

teams faced an Emory team
twice. and al! four decisions
were awarded to the more ex-

Cooley had the highest indi-

with 179 points in eight rounds
