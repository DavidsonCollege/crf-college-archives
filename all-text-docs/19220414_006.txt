NOTICE! NOTICE!

The interest of the alumni at
Commencement this year will cen-
ter around a free alumni banquet,
which is the be given in the alumni
gymnasium on Wednesday, May
31, at 1:00 o'clock. It is desired
that all alumni intending to be
present shall make arrangements
ahead. Those classes desiring class
banquets may also make arrange-
ments.

This is to be the biggest Com-
mencement program ever pft on
at Davidson. It.will be of especial
interest to all the alumni because
examinations are to continue up to
and through commencement and
will thus give the alumni oppor-
tunity to see the student body in
action, a thing not done before.

Mr. R. M. Miller, who is presi-
dent of the Alumni Association, is
gratified with indications of a good
alumni attendance and very opti-
mistic over the prospects. He is
also pleased that time has been
allowed this year in which to
transact alumni business, from 1:00
to 4:00 o’clock on Wednesday hav-
ing been set aside for this purpose.

MINISTERIAL BAND HEARS
SHORT STUDENT SPEECHES

The regular meeting of the Ministerial
Band was held Sunday afternoon. Henry
Patterson brought several matters of
business before the Band, among which
was -that of a Fellowship that is being
organized to unite students of America
for the Evangelization of the United
States. No action was taken concerning
the Band’s joining this Fellowship as
sufficient information was not at hand.
It was decided that a committee be ap-
pointed to draw up a constitutionfor the
Band.

Frank Johnston made a short and in-
spirational talk on “Witnessing for
Christ.” He spoke about the influence
of a Christian, using the example of the
influence of Naomi’s life on the heathen

‘| Ruth, whom she converted to Christian-

ity. A Christian must bear fruits or his
life will profit nothing, said Johnston,
pointing out the fig tree which withered
because it had no fruit to give the Mas-
ter.

L. A. Taylor then spoke briefly “on
“Getting Alone With God.” Taking no
text, but using the experientes of Christ
as He walked alone in the garden and
in other places, Tink told of the ad-
vantages that any young man would
have in getting alone with his Creator,
ard that only at such times could one
feel the very presence of God. There is
a period in the life of every man when
he wonders if there truly is a God. At
stich times Emotion must take precedent
cver Reason. “Be still and know that’ 1
am God.”

SOUTHERN INTERCOLLEGIATE
ASSOCIATION WILL CONVENE

After considerable delay the time and
place of the second annual Southern In-
tercollegiate Newspaper Association
convention have been decided and Fur-
tian University, at Greenville, S. C., will
he the host April 28 and 29.

locate the next gathering of the college
journalists more in the center of*the ter-
ritory covered by the youthful organiza-
tion. Greenville, located in the southern
part of South Carolina, serves this pur-
pose.

With final selection made, invitations
have been mailed to every college and
university in the South to send represen-
tatives and this convention is apparently
to be largely attended. Both men and
women are eligible as delegates. New
/members have been reported by the
‘regional vice presidents, and the mem-

bership ofthe association will evidently
increase materially by the meeting time.

Efforts-were-made-early-in-the year to-

nalistic contest.

As. yet definite arrangements for the
program have not been completed, never-
theless the most absorbing item that will
likely come up before the open discus-
sions will be ways and means of. making
the association a greater functioning
body. Many things have developed since
.the initial gathering at the University of
Richmond that will call for legislation.

The Southern Association of Newspa-
per Publishers has heartily eridorsed

annually the gold medal for the editorial
contest.
Davidson will probably be represented
at the convention by H. H. Smith.

Senior and Junior classes of Queens.|
This part of the program was probably
the. most enjoyed.

The debate was of a very high order)
and the subject matter presented by |
each of the four speakers indicated a
deep study of the question discussed,
while the delivery and stage appearance
in every case was splendid. The four
speakers came back strong on rebuttal,
the closeness of the debate being indi-
cated by the three to two decision of.the
five *judges.

Davidson has won 18 out of 27 debates
in the 14 years of its debating life.
Seven of these have been with Wake
Forest. Of these Davidson has won four.

idea makes it easier to understand the
great problems of life, une ae sin
and death.

His belief in prayer was based on the
fact that God is our Father and it is our
duty and privilege to ask His advice

jand guidance all through our lives. The

highest definition of‘ prayer is a life of
friendship with God, our Father. It was
then brought out that prayer is answer-
td only when it is in perfect LEER
with divine will.

Santa Fe Trail,” “Golden Whales of
California,” etc. He is counted in the
same class with such poets as Edwin
Arlington Robinson, Robert Frost, and
Edward Lee Masters.

Some of the outstanding qualities of
Lindsay’s work are the love of beauty,
a distinct spirit of reform, intensely
American themes and ideals, ay wide
range of subjects, and a belief that poetry
is primarily intended to be read aloud.

As one of a series of literary portraits
the Bookman has the following pen pic-
ture of Lindsay by Christopher Morley:

“Vachel is ruddy, sandy-haired, mid-
dle-sized, with eyes the-color of a green
twilight and pale eyebrows surmounted

coaching positions in the past. David-
son was able to secure his services be-
cause of her nearness to Charlotte
which will enable him to devote his
mornings to the office and his afternoons
to the football field. Mr. Murrill will
spend his vacation, during the month of
September, at Davidson, and so will be
on hand morning and afternoon during
the first and all-important month of the
season,

three winters he lectured at the West

he took a walking trip from Illinois to

This trip furnished the material for his
