The Wildcat -harriers continued

ninth place, Bill Plonk tenth, and
Murray Remson twelfth, thus leav-
ing Fort Bragg the remaining four
places and their many points.

Due to a*strong head wind, the
times recorded over the three-mile
course were not as good as some
posted this year, *

Coach Pete Whittle nominated
these same eight men to go against

Randolph-Macon yesterday, and in

all probability they will carry the
Red and Black into the Southern
Conference meet at Raleigh on
Monday. However, Bill Smith may
get the nod over Remson, and at
any rate the lanky freshman will
be ready to go if he is needed.

With Gray, Bradley and Grube
in top form, the Wildcats have
been given a good chance to grab
top honors in the family meet,
though North Carolina and Duke
are being set as the teams to beat.
