The Beer Case

The State Alcoholic Beverage
Control Board indicated that
Davidson violations of North
Carolina Law in regard to dispen-
sing beer in the College Union
result from the lack of possession
of a license to sell beer and wine.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. maintains, however,
that the college policy of per-
mitting but not encouraging
students to use alcohol would be
violated if the College Union
procured a license. He argues that
the choice to drink is then decided
by the institution rather than by
the individual.

Having a liquor license, would
not allow the College Union to
decide whether or not the in-
dividual student drinks beer. The
open bar concept, with inexpensive
beer sold, would simply offer
students a realistic choice as to
whether they want to drink beer at
any particular time

The coven bar in the Rathskeller
with th: contribution system intact
has been a welcomn e addition to the
College Union prc zram. Students

have had the chance to socialize
with those who learn at Davidson
over a couple of beers, cokes, or
whatever the individual student
wants to drink.

Now that the Union has learned
that its contribution system
violates North Carolina law, the
Union must either obtain a liquor
license or not have an open bar
where beer is sold. The Union can-
not finance free beer.

We encourage the Board of
Trustees to allow the Union to seek
a license to sell beer and wine at
the Union bar. This policy would
allow students to make the decision
as to whether or not they want to
drink beer.

Allowing students to make this
choice is not encouraging but per-
mitting students to drink beer if
they so desire. It is not a violation
of college policy; it is consistent
with present policy.

Only by seeking a liquor license
can the College truly give students
this choice. We strongly recom-
mend that the college do so.

A New Consciousness

One’s conscious 1ess is like a
stream, ever mo ‘ing but never
returning to the po nt of its existen-
ce a moment before.

A year has gone by since THE
DAVIDSONIAN assumed a degree
of my consciousness (and in the
process I a part of its). Its power,
like some mythological force in
non-ordinary reality, has left its
mark, known and yet unex-
pressible.

Now the trip is over, and while I
can see the individual incidents
along the way, the experience as a
whole is but a blur, pleasurable and
yet painful.

I cannot have it all over again,
nor would I if that were possible, for
it is finished and yet never begun.

Beyond these riddles there is lit-
tle that can be said. It is like the
power of Mescalito.

A new consciousness must now
confront THE DAVIDSONIAN. If
it is strong enough it will dominate.
And much that is good will result.

That is not for me to know-for
what lies ahead is beyond my un-
derstanding. The lizard with sewn-
up eyes cannot reveal the future to
me.

Oil might be short these days and. —.

so might toilet paper, but in some
sectors of the American com-
munity. money isn’t so short.

According to a story which ap-
peared last month in the Chicago
Daily News, Frank Sinatra will
receive $600,000 for two one-week
appearences in Las Vegas during
the coming year. That may seem
like a lot of money at first glance,
but after consideration, it seems

like a lot more.

The current populations reports
for 1970 disclosed that in that year,
25.5 million Americans were living
below the official poverty level of
$3,968 annual income for a family
of four. That means that poverty-
level Americans would have to

- work for 1.5 centuries to make what
Frankie will make in two weeks,
all-in-all an efficient allocation of
capital resources. Only in
America.

Mother Betts Tells
Christmas Story

For as long as I can remem-
ber my mother Betts has told
me the following Christmas
story that has never grown
old. Surprisingly, with no
ulterior motive whatsoever,
T'll tell it to you.

If you understand it then you
have that perception that
every five-year-old has, that
perception which is lost and
finally regained with some
maturity.

Once there were twin boys.
Their names were Johnny and
Jimmy. These youngsters
looked exactly alike in every
physical detail; but their at-
titudes were quite different.

Johnny was always quite
happy. No matter what hap-
pened, he played a Polyanna
“Glad Game.” If his parents
gave him any sort of gift, he
was content.

Jimmy, however, was
rarely happy. He played a
‘‘“Grump Game.”’ His parents
did all that they could to make
him content, but he never was.
No matter what they bought
him, he found a fault and
tossed it away.

One Christmas the parents
decided to try to experiment to
see just how happy and un-
jealous Johnny was and how
grumpy and possessive Jim-

MARY HOBBIE

my was.

They determined to buy
Jimmy a new bicycle, an elec-
tric train and race-car set, a
new sled, new sports equip-
ment, and all sorts of other
shiny new toys. They laid
these carefully under Jim-
my’s side of the tree.

Under Johnny's side of the
tree they put horse manure —
nothing more, nothing less.

The next morning the boys
awakened early. They rushed
into the family room to see
what Santa had left them.

The parents sleepily arose
from bed to see their sons’
reaction.

Jimmy was sitting in the
midst of his toys with his ar-
ms folded and a frown filling
his face. ‘What's wrong?”’ his
father asked.

“Santa never gets me what I
want. I wanted a bigger bike,
a longer race-car track, a blue
sled instead of a red one, and
a catcher’s mitt instead of a
fielder’s glove.”

Johnny was sitting on the
couch with a delighted ex-
pression on his face.

He looked over to his
mother, who was sitting on
the other end of the couch,
and said, ‘‘You know, Mama?
Santa brought me a pony, but
he got away.”

Davidson Ponders
Santa’s Existence

You may not have been
aware of it, but there’s been a
lot of controversy on this
campus about the existence of
Santa Claus . (What do you
expect this week? I’m trying
to get some’ Christmas
spirit! )

The debate about Santa
Claus is an emotional tempest.
I, however, have the answer.
The pro-Santa group is not
united which leads to even
more debate. They can't
decide if Santa Claus lives at
the North Pole or in some god-
forsaken place called Santa
Claus’ workshop in the moun-
tains of North Carolina.

Santa Claus lives in Arkan-
sas. Think about it - it makes
sense. What other reason
could there be for the existen-
ce of Arkansas? A lot of people
don't believe in either Santa
Claus or Arkansas.

Well, Arkansas exists. At
least it did last time I looked.
Therefore, if Arkansas exists,
Santa Claus must exist
Q.E.D. (The first math or
philosophy turkey who tells
me my logic is faulty will get
ashes and switches for Christ-
mas.)

It is true, however, that San-
ta Claus has traded in the sled
for a red Cadillac El] Doradoo
which gets 4 m.p.g. This
change is due to the fact that a
sleigh drawn by reindeer is no
longer uncommon. A guy
driving a car with that kind of
gas mileage is really unusual.

I am surprised that this con-
troversy could take place at
Davidson. I remember per-
fectly the night last year that
Santa Claus made an ap-

pearance in Johnston gym at
half-time of a basketball
game. He was surrounded by
an army of kids and threw
handfuls of candy into the
stands. How soon we forget.

I found a letter to Satna
Claus that somebody dropped
on campus. It goes like this -
Dear Santa,

I would like the following
things for Christmas: 1) An
‘A’ from Dr. Abernethy, 2) My
first 3 choices in pre-
registration for spring term,
3) An interpretation of James
Joyce - from English to

‘English, 4) A tape of Dr.

Palmer and Dr. McKelway
humming ‘Foxy-lady’ as
background to Dr. Partin’s
Catherine the Great lecture,
5) A cast-iron stomach - my
ulcer is killing me, 6) A tape
of Miles Ward ‘telling ite

Are you still there? I've
been trying to lose you ever
since we started on this ar-
ticle. Oh well, I admire your
persistence. All I'm asking for
this Christmas is something to
keep me warm this winter.
I'll let you know what I get -
probably a can of jalapeno
peppers! Merry Christmas
everybody!
