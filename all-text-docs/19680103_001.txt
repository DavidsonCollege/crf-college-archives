ing a final decision on the.
ROTC issue.

Implementation of the far-
reaching curriculum changes
will begin next fall.

The Blue Sky Committee
recommended that ROTC.
compulsory for freshmen and
sophomores since 1919, be
made voluntary, but the
trustees, after hearing Col.
Frederick B. Outlaw, profes-
sor of military science. put
_off its decision until May 3.

For Curriculum

Financing problems  in-
volved in instituting the Blue
Sky Committee proposals
have been resolved by bud-
getary reallocations within
the college and additional
outside funds, the President's
Office explained today.

The Board of Trustees ap-
proved the financing propos-
al and the initiation of the
new curriculum at a meeting
Dec. 20 on the campus.

Dean of Faculty Frontis
Johnston said that next year
the new graduation require-
ments and new calendar
would be instituted. The non-
Western studies program,
honors college. and learning
center will be delayed. -

“We plan to have the full
program in operation in two
or three years."’ Johnston
said. “‘However. we still

begin the non-Western studies
and honors college program
next year.”

Budgetary allocations
which will aid in financing
the program include smaller
faculty salary increases and
no enlargement of staff and
administration, according to

ROTC
Will Get
More Study

In order to give the
proposal further study, the
trustees decided to postpone
final consideration of the
ROTC recommendation of the
Blue Sky Committee.

“The trustees did not know
what to do with the proposal:
a great many people there did
not want to see ROTC crip-
pled. which they felt the
recommendation would do. I
don't know how many be-
cause no count was taken,”
said Dean of Faculty Frontis
W. Johnston.

Colonel Frederick B. Out-
law. professor of Military
Science, spoke to the trustees
at the Dec. 20 meeting but
declined to comment on what
he said.

However. Outlaw's prev-
iously stated position is that
making Basic ROTC non-
compulsory, which is the
Blue Sky committee's rec-
ommendation, would destroy
the program. Outlaw feels
that the present program is
the best possible for David-
son.

Lingle said Outlaw appear-
ed before the trustees ‘the
better part of 45 minutes.”

Lingle called the changes
‘*a tremendous step forward"
for the college.

The Blue Sky changes were
initiated by a 1965 visit of
representatives of the South-
ern Association of Colleges
and Schools.

The representatives. while
praising the college in gen-
eral. found the curriculum
‘dull and unimaginative” and
urged the college to do ‘’some
dreaming ,and some blue-
skying.”’

An 1l-man committee of
nine faculty members and
two students, chaired by
Dean of Faculty Frontis W.
Johnston, was appointed in
the spring of 1966.

DR. D. GRIER MARTIN
President Resigns After 10-Year Tenure

Growth, Changes Mark
Martin’s Administration

Since assuming the presi-
dency in the spring of 1958, D.
Grier Martin has led David-
son College on a series of
ventures toward the develop-
ment of academic, financial
and physical resources.

During his term in office.
he has witnessed the suc
cessful completion of a larg?
fund-raising campaign. the
planning for a new library
and learning center, numer-
ous changes in the physical
plant, and the approval of
extensive curriculum
changes.

Last October a new chal-
lenge fund campaign. begun
with a $500,000 conditional
grant from E. H. Little. was
announced to provide a new
$2 million library and Jearn
ing center for the college.

During the period of his
presidency. Martin has led
many projects for construc.
tion and addition to the phy
sical plant of the college.
Projects have included:

-— Patterson Fraternity
Court. $500,000;

— Charles A. Dana Science
Laboratories, $725.000:

. — Martin Science building
remodeling, $50,000:

-— Cunningham Fine Arts
Center, $680,000;

have known President Mar-
tin for many years and have
an affection and respect for
him such as I have had for
few men. His resignation is
characteristic of the man.

“When he decided that he
had made his maximum con-
tribution and that new lead-
ership should be called in for
a renewal of the drive for
excellence at Davidson, he
made a decision that he felt
was for the best interest of
the college.”

McGavock was the only fac-
ulty member interviewed that
would comment on what
qualifications Martin's

— Lake Norman campus
recreation center, $47,000;

— College Union addition
and remodeling. $337,000:

— Steam plant moderniza
tion. $165,000;

— Chambers building re.
modeling, including the Dome
Room, Love Auditorium, and
the remainder of the entire
building, $2 million.

A two-year humanities pro
gram was conceived and he-
gun during Martin’s tenure.
along with a developmental

reading program, intercolleg
jiate debate, an audio-visual
center. a language labora-
tory, a drama department,
and the first Negro students
were admitted.

Among other curricular ad
ditions at the school during
Martin's ptesidency- was the
institution of a Junior-year
abroad program in 1964.
The Richardson International
Scholar program also was
operative during his entire
presidency.

Student Opinion:
‘A Great Person’

A sampling of student opin-
ion following Dr. D, Grier
Martin's announcement of
his resignation this afternoon
revealed both respect and
admiration for his achieve-
ments.

Speculation was rifé among
the students contacted that
the successor for Martin. will
be drawn from somewhere
outside the Davidson College
community.

Tom Earnhardt, Student
Council President reflected

successor should have or who
might be considered for the
presidency.

“I would be unrealistic to
say that any man has all of
these qualifications I think
that perhaps the time has
come for Davidson to con-
sider a division of responsibi-
ties. It is impossible for one
man to take the lead in
searching out financial sup-
port such as is needed in all
good schools today, and at
the same time give leader-
ship in raising a college to
true academic excellence.”

Other faculty members
(See REACTION, Page Two)

the view of a majority of the
students. He said. “I am
very sorry he is leaving. but
I feel very fortunate to have
had the opportunity to know
and to observe this truly
great administrator and per
son."

Senior Joe Beard also ex-
pressed regret. saying, ‘']
hope that the trustees will
choose a successor who is
committed to the same pre-
servation of academic stand-
ards and unique character
of Davidson College.”

A majority of the students
polled noted Martin's abili-
ties as a fund-raiser and a
number of them hoped that
this ability would be shared
by his successor.

William Farris, a sopho-
more, said that he felt ‘the
school needs a great deal of
Money to continue its pace of
change: it needs someone to
foltow President Martin who
knows how to get it.”

Nat Heyward. a senior,
summed up the majority of
the comments of the students
with opposing views: ‘‘He
was a great administrator,
but 1 hope that the next
president will perhaps be
more academically inclined.”

Junior Randy Phillips saw
the opening as a chance to
obtain ‘“‘a young, dynamic
president who might set the
place on fire—who would
wake us up.”

Climax Tenure

.Dr. D. Grier Martin, president of Davidson since
1958, told the faculty today that he had tendered his
resignation to the college trustees.

His resignation will become effective on June 30.

Martin explained that his decision was made at
this time because the successful conclusion of the Ford
Challenge campaign and the approval of a new cur-
riculum to begin next fall combined to form an ap-
propriate climax to his decade in the presidency.

Martin said that the pres
sures and responsibilities of
the office will, in the next
decade. demand physical
stamina beyond his present
resources. ;

Walter L. Lingle. Jr., presi-
dent. of the trustees. issued
the following statement:

“It is with deep regret that
I must respect Dr. D. Grier
Martin's request that I sub.
mit his resignation to the
trustees of Davidson College.
Dr. Martin has been a great
president of Davidson Col-
lege. During his 10-year ten-
ure the college has advanced
on ali fronts. The col-
lege has advanced = on
all fronts. He has given the
leadership for an increase in
the value of the college's en-
dowmient and plant of over
$13 million.

“The quality and the
breadth of the college's cur-

riculum has already been
markedly improved during
Dr. Martin's administration
and he -has recently helped
to set the course for a fur-
ther important advance in
curriculum. The standing of
the college in academic cir
cles has reached an all-time
high during Dr. Martin's
term in office.

“I only hope that we can
be fortunate enough to find
someone of equal stature to
succeed him."

President Gives
Personal Reasons

ED. NOTE: This is the text
of President D. Grier Mar-
tin’s statement to the faculty
this afternoon.

For a total of 19 years. it
has been my high privilege to
serve Davidson College: from
1933 to 1936 as Alumni Secre
tary. from 1951 to 1958 as
Treasurer and Business Man-
ager, and since 1958 as Presi-
dent of the College.

This experience. has been
one of, great challenge. re
sponsibility and honor. It is
the type.of experience that
comes to few men. ] am
grateful to this faculty. to-the
trustees, to my administra
tive colleagues. to the ajumni.
parents and ‘friends—to all
those who during this period
have worked zealously and
well to achieve a record of
progress-—both in educationa}
program and in financial re.
sources.

Credit for whatever pro.
gress has been made during
the last 10 years should go to
the trustees for their overail
guidance and support, to the
faculty which is responsible
for the academic program
and for many other areas of
the college’s life, to my asso
ciates in the administration
who have helped and support-
ed me and to that large group
of people on our staff who
provide the facilities and ser.
vices which make possible the
effective work of faculty, stu-
dents and administration.

Now, however, because of

uA .
personal considerations. it is
my plan to retire from the
presidency of the college at
the end of the current aca-
demic year in June. The suc-
cessful conclusion of the Ford
Challenge campaign and the
approval of a new curriculum
to begin next fall combine to
form an appropriate climax
to a strenuous decade in the
presidency.

It is my expectation that I
will utilize my experience in
the service of higher educa
tion during the years ahead
in various special and consul-
tative capacities. My plans in

this’ regard will be shared
with you as they become de-
finite.

You may be sure that I will ©
always do everything I can—
both before and after June 30
—to further the welfare and
effectiveness of this college
and the people—faculty, stu.
dents. administrators and
alumni--who are its most im
portant assets.

1 am certain that Davidson
is on the threshold of probab
ly the most important period
in its history. I"am deeply
confident. too, that you will
more than méasure up to the
tasks ahead. They will in
volve, as vou know, the blend
ing of all the traditional
strength. that is Davidson
with the creative flexibility
needed to make. Davidson's
future the profoundly excit-
ing and inspiring story it can
and must be. It will tell. as it
has in the past. of students
and teachers searching to.
gether for truth. and for a
better world.

My wife, our family and I
feel a deep gratitude to Da
vidson College and the won-
derful people who live and
work here and we shall al-
ways cherish and remember
our personal friendships with
all of you. I wanted you to be
the first to have this infor.
mation. It is the members of
the faculty who made known
to the trustees in 1958 that
they would be pleased if I
were appointed to the presi-
dency of the college.

Without that enthusiastic
endorsement, I am certain
that the trustees would not
have elected me to the office.
Without that endorsement I
would not have accepted the
appointment.

“The past is but prologue
to the future’’ and I am sure
that you and all of us who
have faith in this college will
continue to work to develop
‘tmen of humane instincts, of
disciplined and creative
minds, and of Christian char-
acter for full lives of leader-
ship, of service. and of self-
fulfillment.”
