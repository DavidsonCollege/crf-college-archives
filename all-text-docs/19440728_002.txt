Student Store .7: ~~

There is no longer a Student Store at
Davidson. The establishment in the base-
ment of the gym which has taken over the
stock and the name of the Student Store
is neither managed nor clerked by stu-
dents. nor is it even operated with the stu-
dents’ interests primarily in mind

Tt ts perfeetiy obvious that the present
location of the store is most inconvenient
to civilian students. It is entirely of the
beaten track of daily activities tor everv-
one on the campus. Because of location
alone a large percentage of tivithan sti
dents have shiited clsewhere, their trade
m such items as the Stud has always car-
ried. There is little point in waiking out
of the way toa plaee devoid of student at-
mosphere to buy something which could
be gotten more conveniently and more
congenially somewhere else.

Then there is the matier of hours. The
Stud is now open tour hours a day,
_whereas wmder the student clerk system
it was Open twice that long even in the
midst of the clerk power shortage. One
of the great advantages of the Seid has
always becn that it has been open almost
any time a student wanted a snack, a
moke. of any of the various supplies in
the store. The present set-up further
discourages students from going to the
Stud because of the fact that the chances
are two to one that it will be closed when
they want something. Furthermore. past
experience proves that the Stud cannot de
depended upon to be open even in the
hours set forth. It is certainly a disheart-
ening situation from the viewpoint of the
civilian students.
Of course it may be said with some
justice that it is the students’ fault that
the store cannot stay open longer, since an

appeal was made in chapel with only one
lone response. But how can anyone hope
to find student clerks when the place of

dull? We have heard several individuals
comment that they would like to work in
the Stud if it were in its old location, and
doubtless the reader has heard remarks to
the same effect, The clerk problem would
be well on the way to a solution if the Stud
were in its old location behind the old gym.

The objection has been raised that the
old location is not large enough—that
stock and customers were often thrown
together in the midst of the floor in a con-
fusion past all extrication: This objection
may also be partially justified, but was not
the former situation far better from the
students’ point of view than 4 store in

which the only civilian is behind the '

counter’ The store may make just as
much money under the present arrange-
ment, but in view of the fact just mention-
ed it is not a Students’ Store.

Up to this point the Stud has been one
of Davidson's truly cherished traditions.
Its purpose through the years has been to
serve the student body as a whele, to pro-
vide opportunines for work for a good
number of students, and through its
prolits to aid students needing financial
hetp. At the end of the regular spring
semester. last May the frst two of shese
purposes were abandoned, and the Stu-
dent Store in its traditional form. quiezty
expired. Fncidentally, it expired without
the students having a voice in its trans’
formation; indeed, even without their
knowing what was being done to the store
they had been led to believe was theirs.

Those who are responsible for the
choice that was made take sweet refuge
in the old standby, “Cest la guerre.” The
problems which the war has caused plague
every business—that is granted. It is
most fortunate that all such enterprises
have not seen fit to meet these problems
waving a white flag. which is what the
Stud has done in effect by withdrawing
from its old clientele and surrendering its
purposes.

It Could
Be Worse

By ROBERT MORRISON

Old Ones With A New Slant, or
There’s Nothing New Uned the Sun.

Davidson, N. C. (APE) (Delayed)

‘ (Delayed so long that it didnt make

the first page.) According to an un-
confirmed rumor from an unrétiable
source, a tremendous political move-
ment is afoot in the Davidson under-
ground. Alired McNair, radical pro-
communist, has organized the “So-

—cial—Upliit—Union“_John—MeNair,—

Alfred’s brother, has entered the

_race_as the party's candidate jor

Abie? sviee presidency. Young McNair,

_ stressing the anti-professor platform

of his party, declared, “Solomon
killed one thousand men with the
jaw-bone of an ass, but ten thous-
and students throughout Ameriea
are bored to death each day with
the same weapon.”

ian who interviewed McNair asked
him if he was an attending student
at-bBavitson—€Enallege. “No”
plied, “I just go to school here.”

It was understood that McNair’s
party has been organized primarily
to retaliate for Doc Hollinger’s be-

ing thrown out of- school for using

a red pencil. The dean declared that
Hollinger was impersonating a pro-
fessor.
Hollinger flunked out after putting
a period upside down on one of Dr.
Shewmaké’s Tevitwss

However, it was further rumored
that the party was formed in de-

after telling Dr. Logan that the ni-
trate of sodium. was the same as
day rate. Wier, however de-
clared that he had answered correct-
ly when Dr. Togan asked, “If 1 drop
this dime in this solution, will it dis--
solve?”

“No, replied Wier. -
“Fine,” said the pedagogue.
“Why?”

“Because if the dime would dis-
solve, you wouldn't drop it inf” _
The professer declared that if

would be a power-house.

Wier said that he did not believe
that he deserved an absolute zero
on the course. Dr. Logan said, “No,
Mr. Wier, I don't think you deserve
an absolute zero, cither, but that's
the lowest .grade I could give you.”

As Wier was leaving the class,

he commented that Dr. Logan was -

so dumb that he though “D. C.”
stood for direct current. The class

He_was more—was dismissed carly that day because

they promised not to wake up Prof.
Thies’ class on the way down the,
hall.

During , the convention held

In support wet Brown's motion,

J. P. Horton arose to declare that
President Rodsevelt had promised;
if re-elected, 10 appropriate fifteen.
billion dollars to fill the Grand Can-
yon with. heer, -

Alfred Searborough brought our

the point that Roosevelt had_dec-

lared that the fourth -term would:
be his last.

Sam Burgess insisted that all the
presidents—of— United States had
been passed by the same college.
Rurgess stated thgt this was ‘the
electoral | callege.

Sandy Shaw arose, to ‘refute
Brown ‘and’ nominate. Hose Nose
Monroe, but Hose aid he'd rather
be tight than president.

Ed Pichard, in a pointed attack
against the faculty, related these
facts-about Dr. Richards:
