Iran attacks Baghdad, Bork nomination apparently fails

By KATHERINE M. PRICE
Headlining the news Oct. 2-8: :
Around the World -- Iran attacked the Iraqi
capital of Baghdad on Monday, following
earlier Iraqi raids on 5 oil tankers. The
Iranian missile attack on Baghdad led to Iraqi
promises of retaliation, as the 7-year-old
Iran/Iraq war drags on. .

Chinese police were sent to control pro-
independence demonstrations in Lhasa, the
capital of Tibet. Nine people were killed and
over 60 people were arrested in the ensuing
violence. Protesters were believed to be
Buddhist monks, who were demonstrating
on the 37th anniversary of China’s military
takeover of Tibet.

Over 50 people drowned when a boat car-
rying illegal refugees sank in the Caribbean.
The refugees had left the Dominican Repub-
lic and were on their way to Puerto Rico
when the boat went down in shark-infested

waters.

In South Korea, the opposition party an-
nounced that it will delay its convention
because of split support for Kim Young Sam
and Kim Dae Jung. South Korea’s first direct
presidential elections in 16 years are sched-
uled for Dec. 20.

Mexican President Miguel de te Madrid
chose Carlos Salinas de Gortari to succeed
him as president last Sunday. Mexican elec-
tions will not be held until July, but since the
incumbent president has traditionally hand-
picked his successor, and the ruling Institu-

tional Revolutionary Party has won every:

election since 1929, Salinas appears destined
for the office.

Egyptian President Mubarak was over-
whelmingly elected to a second 6-year term.
Mubarak ran unopposed in anational refer-
endum on Monday.

In the South Pacific, Fiji’s military leader
declared Fiji to be a republic. Fiji has had

connections with the British monarchy for
113 years.

Across the Nation -- Los Angeles experi-
enced the largest earthquake to hit California
in 16 years last Thurs. The earthquake
measured 6.1 on theRichter scale, and was
responsible for 7 deaths, as well as extensive
property damage. The nomination of Robert
Bork for Supreme Court justice appears
doomed, as the Senate Judiciary Committee
voted 9-5 torecommend his rejection. The
full Senate is also expected to reject the
nomination. Bork wasnominated by Presi-
dent Reagan to succeed retired Justice Lewis
Powell.

The Supreme Court began its session this
week, without Bork, and therefore lacking
one member. The eight Supreme Court jus-
tices agreed to hear over twenty cases, in-
cluding a case involving a New York anti-
bias law on the privacy of clubs.

William Sessions, the future FBI director,

had to indefinitely postpone his swearing-in
ceremony due toa bleeding ulcer.

* The Pentagon has decided to go ahead with

the testing of the new Trident 2 missile with
12 warheads, despite Administration and
congressional concerns that such testing will
further complicate U.S./U.S.S.R. arms con-
trol talks.

The House of Representatives approved a
bill that forces airlines to pay customers for
flights cancelled for reasons unrelated to
safety.

House Speaker Jim Wright criticized
Reagan’s position on Nicaragua and the

Central American peace plan. Reagan has -

threatened to request $270 million in military
aid to the contras unless the Sandinista
Government of Nicaragua stops accepting
Soviet and Cuban military aid and advisers,
holds new presidential elections, reduces the
size of the military, and takes definitive steps
towards democracy.

Emory dean discusses Davidson's semesters

Transition smooth, he reports

Emory University's Dr. Garland Richmond \

By SUSAN PEARSALL

Last Monday, Associate Dean
of Emory College Dr. Garlind
Richmond addressed student con-
cerns about the impending switch
from terms to the semester system
here at Davidson (to take place in
1988).

Although few students attended
the talk, which was followed by
questions from the floor, those who
did were assured that, at least at
Emory, both faculty and students
alike were very pleased with the
results of the changeover.

Dr. Richmond, who heads the

Department of Student Academic
Affairs, described his role at
Emory as one of “general supervi-
sory, and ccordinating responsibil-
ity” in several areas, including
curricular and academic develop-
ment.

He explained that he had been
asked to coordinate the change to
semesters, which took place there
in 1982, partially because he was at
first opposed to the idea. Now,
however, he describes himself as
“delighted” with the new calendar
and the curriculum, which was
completely reconstructed to in-

crease the amount of material
taught in each course (a measure
which will not be taken by
Davidson’s faculty).

Like Davidson, Emory left the

* final decision on the semester issue

up to a vote by the faculty, a vote
which proved extremely close. At
the time, Richmond related, he
never talked to a student who did
not oppose the change. Because of
this formidable student opposition,
the Administration attempted to
placate student opinion and to
address their concems with a series
of meetings designed to elicit stu-
dent questions on the change.

They then took all the questions
and set up. “conversion tables”
which carefully illustrated the
equivalency. of credits earned in
distribution and major require-
ments.

In addition, during the summer
before the change took place,
administrators made a degree audit
of every currently enrolled student.
Each student received a personal-
ized letter showing him what he
had taken and exactly what courses
he would need to earn his degree.
In every case that a question arose

‘concerning the equivalency of

credit, the student was given.the
benefit of the doubt (mainly be-
cause, said Richmond, “We feel

that whatever you’re doing at
Emory is worthwhile, so we dids1*t
worry about giving too many
“preaks’.”). The result: when
school resumed in the fall, there
were almost no students who were
unhappy about the change.

_ Thekey to their smooth transi- '
tion, then, was “going that extra

mile to make sure that no student
was put at a disadvantage,” ex-
plained Richmond. In the five
years following the switch,
Emory’s experience with semes-
ters has been “absolutely positive.”

Participation in extracurricular
activities has increased prodi-
giously since the introduction of
semesters. The membership of
Volunteer Emory, for example, has

gone from 300 to 1000. The school. ....

now has three newspapers instead
of one, and the orchestra and band
have reported “dramatic” increases
in size.

Furthermore, many students en-
joy the freedom which the flexibil-
ity of the system affords them.
They can schedule classes only on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fri-
days or take five instead of four
courses a semester so that they can
graduate early.

. Richmond also believes that the

change tosemesters has improved
students’ academic achievements.

A recent survey indicates that a far
greater number of: students now
take course overloads, and: the
school’s MCAT scores have im-

‘proved.

In fact, the only disadvantage
which Richmond was able to cite is
that, since the school year now
starts in late August, the hot Geor-
gia summer sun is a problem for
‘those who live in dorms without
air-conditioning.

Davidson students present to

hear Dr. Richmond appeared con- °

cerned primarily with study areas
in pre-med, Humanities, and lan-
guage requirements. Dr. Charles
Dockery allayed some of their
fears when he-said that, while
Emory expanded the amount of

material covered in each course, at

Davidson, “the whole ideais to do
the same amount of work in a
longer period of time.”

Certainly, it seems that the prob-

lems Davidson is experiencing -

with student apathy toward extra-
curricular and volunteer activities
could be lessened after the new
calendar goes into effect. Dr.
Richmond, at least, appeared con-
fident that Emory’s recent suc-
cesses in these areas can be attrib-
uted to the introduction of the
semester system.
