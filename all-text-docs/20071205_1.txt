Students, faculty discuss
Environmental Studies

By ALISSA CURRAN
News Editor

For many years, Davidson stu-
dents have demanded an environ-
mental studies concentration. But &
is only recently that the proposal is
close to becomming a reality.

Last week, the Educational
Policy Committee approved the
proposal for an Environmental
Studies concentration. The concen-
tration is pending approval from
the faculty, who will meet this
week to review it.

The third meeting of the
Academic Policy Forum, focused
on the proposed environmental
studies concentration and students
were encouraged to ask questions
of Professor of Economics, Dave
Martin, Associate Professor of
English, Annie Ingram, and

Professor of Anthropology, Matt

Martin, a coordinator for envi-

ronmental curiosity among
Davidson students on a local and
global level that has fueled interest
in an environmental studies con-
centration for years.

All proposals up to this point
have incorporated the liberal arts
philosophy by requiring at least
one credit in the humanities, natu-
ral sciences, and social sciences for
successful completion.

Martin explained that the great-
est hindrance to the approval of
this program relates to the accessi-
bility of faculty.

the concentration is the perceived

Warner Hall hosts panel discussion
promoting HIV/AIDS awareness

By KATHERINE JOHNSON
Staff Writer

On Nov. 27, Warner Hall hosted
the panel discussion “HIV/AIDS:
Locally and Globally.” The discus-
sion was one of many AIDS aware-
ness events Warner hosted leading
up to World AIDS Day on Dec. 1.

Professor of Biology, Dave
Wessner, moderated the discussion.
The panel consisted of Devin Baez
of the Metrolina AIDS Project
(MAP), Courtney Sanders ’09,
Carlos Flores ’08 and Professor of
Biology, Verne Case.

The discussion highlighted
AIDS’s impact on both the local
area and on Africa, particularily

Mwandi where  Davidson’s
Department of Biology hosts a
summer program. The panel mem-
bers came to the consensus that the
main ways to fight the spread of
the disease both locally and global-
ly was through education and open
communication.

Baez, whose work for MAP
helps local families affected by
AIDS, shared startling statistics on
AIDS’s local impact. According to
Baez, AIDS is “very much a prob-
lem in Charlotte.” Most of those
infected are in the 30-39 age group,
and African-Americans are by far
the most impacted by the disease in
the local area, followed by
Caucasians and Hispanics. Fifty-

two percent of those infected in
Mecklenberg County are homosex-
ual males, and 89 percent of infect-
ed women are African-American.
Baez warned that the statistics
could be slightly skewed, as only
those who were tested for HIV
were included in the statistics, and
certain groups, like Hispanics, are
less likely to be tested for AIDS.
Flores elaborated on the Latino
community’s reticence. “For the
Latino community, you don’t dis-
cuss [AIDS]” because it is still
seen as a “white gay disease. They
don’t understand that it is a disease
that affects populations across the
spectrum.” Latinos, who comprise

Ada Jenkins: Listening to understand

By Curis MooRE
News Editor

The Ada Jenkins Center’s
founders, staff and board of direc-
tors “strongly believe that unfore-
seen circumstances can place peo-
ple of all walks of life at risk’.

Whether a family faces illness,
job loss or other life situations, Ada
is there to help and provide tools
for a better life.

For nine years now, The Ada
Jenkins Center has been a large
part of the Davidson community.
To maintain their strong presence
and continue to grow overtime,
Ada will need help keeping up with
the rapidly changing Lake Norman
area.

With recent changes to Ada’s
leadership and Town government,
The Davidsonian felt it would be
timely to educate members of the
community who might not know
all that Ada Jenkins has to offer.

History

The main building of The Ada
Jenkins Center began as a school-
house. In the early 1920s, when a
fire destroyed a small wooden
schoolhouse in the Mock Circle

area of Davidson, the school’s
principal, Miss Ada Jenkins, raised
money and built a new brick
schoolhouse with the help of other
community members.

The school, then named the
Davidson Colored School, re-
opened in 1937. However, the
school closed in 1966 when
schools in Davidson integrated,
and the students transferred to
Davidson Elementary School and
the Torrence Lytle High School in
Huntersville.

In the 70s, 80s and early 90s, the
building served as a community
center, offering various educational
and human services, including a
food co-op, a dance studio and an
after school program.

Then in 1995, members of the
community renovated the building
and established The Ada Jenkins
Center in its current form. The
grand opening was held on Nov 8,
1998, with Ada Jenkins’s daughter
and granddaughter in attendance.

Since then, the Center has rapid-
ly grown to become a well-respect-
ed model for non-profits in the
region, broadening its services to
the entire Lake Norman area.
Recently, the Duke University

School of Divinity recognized The
Ada Jenkins Center as a “Model
Organization for Building
Communities of Caring.”

Leadership

On Sept. 22, Bill Johnson left his
post as Executive Director of The
Ada Jenkins Center after six years
of dedicated leadership. With his
heip, the Center transitioned from a
small community center into a
regional beacon of hope for many
families in need living in the Lake
Norman region.

With the incredible growth in the
area, the Center daily faced new
challenges and a broadening serv-
ice area from Huntersville to
Troutman. Turning people away
was not an option, so new means of
funding and fundraising were
sought to ensure that programs
were added and new services were
offered. To this end, Johnson
increased the budget from
$422,000 to $726,000 during his
tenure.

Johnson attributes this growth to
several factors. “We have gotten
the word out to the community so
