OPINIONS

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1997

The purpose of this article is
twofold: to level a charge of racism
against the Campus Safety Depart-
ment, and to examine the ways in
which racism shapes the way we
think.

Each month, Campus Safety
releases information that is com-
piled in a column in the News sec-
tion of the Davidsonian called
“Campus Crime,” which lists crimes
that took place during the previous
month. For the December 9 issue,
the Campus Police released the fol-
lowing in connection with the theft
of two laptop computers, a portable
CD player, a CD, and a bookbag:

11/7/96, 2200 hours

Two witnesses reported having seen
a black male and black female on
the second floor of Little Library in
the area of the stolen items. The
couple was observed between 1100
and 1300 hours. Witness states that
‘the two had asked her about the
photocopiers and where they were
located.

The only thing that the article
overtly states is that two black
people were seen in the library dur-
ing the late morning or early after-
noon. Since the article is “Novem-

ber Crime,” one conclusion to draw
is that it is a crime to be black and to
be in the library, especially if a
larceny happens to have taken place
in that area. The article implies that
if you are black, you become a
prime suspect in the investigation
of this crime.

“November Crimes,” not ““Novem-
ber Suspects.” On this note, [looked
in archived issues of the
Davidsonian, but this naming of
suspects seems to be unique. Since
the two individuals were not charged
with the crime, and since the evi-
dence against them is not conclu-

phasizes the idea that black people
are out of place in Little Library.
Since these two blacks were in the
library, and since this fact is re-
ported in “November Crime,” we
are prompted to be suspicious of the
presence of any black person. Typi-
cally, the campus police list the race

The campus police, in their in-
vestigation of the crimes, probably
had good reason to consider these
two individuals as suspects. Re-
leasing this suspicion is another mat-
ter. After all, the column is entitled

My claim becomes salient
when one considers the conse-
quences of printing the article. The
connection between these individu-
als and the crime is made concrete:
when we think of the possible crimi-
nals, they should be black. At the
same time, the two black people are
not particular black people.. As a
result, anyone whois black is impli-
cated. Moreover, the article em-

not attempt to exonerate ourselves,
however, by appealing to what our
overt intentions were. My claim is
that racism (as well as sexism and
classism) grabs hold of us in ways
that we don’t suspect. We should
always turn critical attention to our-
selves and to our society.
Narratives like the one above
shape the way we perceive each
other. We should always strive to
examine the way we think about
others and ourselves. In what way

does racism influence this percep-
tion? It might help to think about it
this way. We can watch videos of
protesting blacks being hosed and
attacked by police dogs. We might
ask, “How could people treat other
human beings that way?” We must
ask ourselves, “How will people 30
years in the future evaluate race
relations today?” Reality has a way
of encompassing us, but we must
step back and examine it. We must
challenge images such as the “wel-
fare queen,” black violence and
crime, and black poverty. Do we
accept these social constructs as
how the world is supposed to be?
I have presented a serious
charge against the Campus Safety
Department. [hope that it will try to
answer some of these charges. Bet-
ter yet, I hope it will turn critical
attention towards itself. Relations
with blacks on campus and the cam-
» pus police have been a focus in the
past, and the campus police have
been optimistic about the improve-
ments made. I would suggest that
this optimism is unwarranted. Ad-
ditionally, we, like the campus po-
lice, should constantly strive to root
outthe racism, sexism, and classism
“that mold the way we view the world.

Nothing Like the Third World...

So I’m in Kenya, on the phone
with the United States Embassy in
Uganda, waiting for a reply to my
question, “Is it safe for American
women to travel in southwest
Uganda?” The response I received
after some hesitation was “Well,
yes, it should be. The fighting is
mostly in the north, and the last time

bullets were fired over the border

from Zaire was a good two weeks
ago.” So four friends and I went.
We had six days of freedom from
the watchful eye of the School for
Field Studies, and we wanted to see
another country and hopefully the
nearly extinct mountain gorillas. We
bought one-way overnight bus tick-
ets to Uganda’s capital city,
Kampala. “Nothing like the third
world” became the motto of our
journey. :

We arrived in Kampala in one
piece and wanted to do some ex-
ploring. Now, Uganda doesn’t have
nearly the amount of tourism that
Kenya has, so five little white girls,
most of us blonde and blue-eyed,
stood out just a bit. Having been in
Africa over almost two months, I
was used to being stared at, but this

“was ridiculous. Everywhere we
went people pointed and screamed
“Wazungu, hey, wazungu!”, which
means “white person, hey, white
person!”. Women stared at my
clothes with awe and sometimes
digust, children laughed, babies
cried, men proposed, it was quite an
experience. But the strangest inci-
dent occurred when we rounded a

corner on a street and coming to-
wards us was a tall, beady-eyed
psycho we affectidnately named
Crazy Pete, holding a dead cat by
the tail. He saw us and started
screaming “WAZUNGU!!!” and
pointed at the cat as he started swing-
ing itatus. All my friends, traitors,
hid behind me sol’ m trying to duck
this dead animal and run away.
Meanwhile this car full of Ugandan

road. Every town we came to (i.e.
every place where more than three
people, four cows, and a goat lived)
we had to-stop at. Every time we
stopped people ran up to the bus and
started shoving various items
through the windows. You know,
chickens, bananas, bread, pictures
of the president, the usual. At this
point somebody would see the
wazungus and everyone would go

drive us up there in his car for a
mere $100. This was the best price
we could get for the five hour drive,
so we agreed.

He took us to his car and we
saw this white pick-up truck with a
tarp in the back. He saw our faces
and laughed “No, that’s not my
car.” Relieved, we looked to the car
he was pointing at, a yellow pick-up
truck with no tarp. So we said what

women had stopped to
watch and were laugh-
ing hysterically. This
distracted Crazy Pete
long enough for us to
make our escape.
That’s the third world,
I guess.

The next morning
we started our journey
to see the gorillas. We
went to the Department

the hell and climbed in.
The ride wasn’t that bad,
pretty bumpy (no roads
are paved), but the scen-
ery was amazing. You
have to understand,
Ugandan streets are ap-

sides, and are highly in-

of Tourism and asked them which
park we should visit. As they were
telling us to go to this one place,
because we’d have a better chance
of seeing the gorillas, someone
comes over the radio saying troops
from Zaire have just invaded that
park, so we decided to go with the
other park. .

Getting to the Bwindi National
Park was an ordeal. First we had to
take a bus to Kabale, the largest
town near the park. This was the
point at which our motto turned to
“Just get me there alive.” The bus
was really crowded, which was good
because at least I couldn’t see how
many times we almost ran off the

crazy ““Wazungu, buy my chicken!
Hey wazungu, marry me and take
me to America!” If you bought a
soda, you had to chug it really fast
so you could give the bottle back to
the guy you bought it from before
the bus started moving again. The
weirdest thing, though, was chicken-
on-a-stick, a roasted chicken that
had been impaled with a stick, that
they would shove in through the
window right into your face. By the
end, it actually looked sort of good.

So when we finally got to
Kabale, we had to figure out how to
get from there to the park. That’s
where Crazy Pete #2 comes in. He
told us that he would be glad to

ens, cows, and machete
carrying children. As we sped
around a curve at around 80 km/hr,
we would inevitable spot one of the
above in our path. Our driver’s
method of dealing with this was to
blow the horn, then speed up and
aim for whatever was in our path.
At this point the motto evolved to “I
don’t care if I die, I just don’t want
tobe mangled.” Asit started getting
dark, we started getting nervous.
The ride was taking forever, we had
no idea where we were, we kept
having to stop at these police checks
where men with bad attitudes and
AK47’s were checking out the
wazungus, and our driver had de-

cided to bring two friends along

who were shotgun with him. We
didn’t really get scared until we
started seeing refugees from Zaire
jumping into the bushes as we drove
along. “White slavery” crossed our
minds just a few times. When we
finally got to the park, we were
watching our driver negotiate with
the park warden about where we
could sleep. Suddenly, this voice
behind me goes “Boo!”, I about
passed out I was so scared. I turned
around and it was this cute little
man. He laughed “‘You thought I
was ananimal???” We laughed “No,
we just thought you were going to
kill us.” He ended up helping us
find a place to stay that night.

So I got to see the mountain
gorillas, a truly amazing experi-
ence. We had hiked all morning
with a tracker, following their trail.
The moment when we found them
was absolutely incredible. I*was
staring at the silverback, thinking
about the closeness of man and

’ beast, the insignificance of the hu-
. man race in the span of the earth’s
life, the beauty and grace with which
these magnificant creatures move.
Tears were coming into my eyes as
the silverback, in all his greatness,
looked up and stared into my eyes.

I could feel the evolutionary
connection between us, the close-
ness was indescribable. He looked
at me with such intense curiosity,
and let out a fart that lasted ten full
seconds and was probably heard
across the continent. There really is
nothing quite like the third world.
