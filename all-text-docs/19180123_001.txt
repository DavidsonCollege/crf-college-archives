Gilbert Morrison
Writes of Experiences

In France Learning Acrobatic
Stunts in the Air.

The following extracts from a letter
of Gilbert Morrison's, '16, will be read
with interest by his many friends and
comrades here:

“More than a week ago 1 went up in
an altitude test, but | can’t say that |
enjoyed it. [didn’t leave the ground
until after 4 o'clock and the officer in
charge told me to come down before it
got dark and [| could finish it the next
day. It took me about 20 minutes to
gain my altitude, 12,000 feet, and when
I got there it was beginning to get
dark, but I decided to stick out the re-
quired 15 minutes, even though I had to
land in the dark. It was horribly cold
at that height, but I had on lots of
heavy clothes and also fleece-lined snow
shoes, so didn’t notice it much. When
my 15 minutes had expired I nosed the
machine over with a little power on and
came to the ground like a bullet, as it
was getting very dark, and | wanted to
get down as soon as possible. When
I got about half way down my ears be-
gan to ache horribly, duc to the sudden
pressure of the lower atmosphere, and |
don’t remember when I have experienced
such pain. I succeeded in making a
safe landing but couldn’t hear a thing
for quite a while. You may be sure
the next time I go so high I shall come
down more slowly.

“Tuesday, 27th, four of us had to get
up at 4:30 in the morning and drive
over to in an automobile to fly back
four machines. It was snowing when
we left here but it didn’t last long. We
arrived at about 9 o'clock, but the
weather was too bad ‘to fly back, so we
had to stay there until Friday after-
noon, which was:a treat to us, as is
a good town and we could stay in a
good hotel and eat good food. F.very
day we would go out to the flying field,
get out our machines and fly around a
little, but didn’t try to come here, as
the clouds were too low. * * *

“Friday the clouds were still low,
but we knew that if we did not get back
to camp that day we. would be a month
late in getting our pay, as we were to
sign the payroll that day, so we started
back. The clouds were only about 600
feet from the ground, so I decided to go
above them and fly part of the way and
take a chance on finding my position on
the map when I came down. It was
mighty pretty above them. looked almost
like the sea. Then I was in the sun-
light while the ground under me was
covered with black clouds. When I

Dr. Bradley Tells

of Work in China

Mission Study Classes Have Been
Organized.

‘The 100 students who attended the
firsts Y. M. C. A. meeting for 1918
were well repaid for their time in hear-
ing Dr. J. W. Bradley. a medical mis-
sionary from Sutsien, China. Dr.
Bradley addressed the students at this
time at the request of the Missionary
Committee of the Association as this
was the rally in the interest of mission
study.

The opening remarks of the speaker
were forceful and timely. “hey vividly
pictured the condition of the world at
the present time as it is now wrapped in
war, yet the speaker would not allow
his audience to foregt that while this

great physical war «was waging there

was the greater spiritual conflict also in
progress, He urged that every man
stand for what was right and that if any
one thought that his duty called him into

the service. of his country that he was

perfectly right in doing that thing.

Furthermore, he said that he would
not say one word to mislead one, for he
thought the great war that our nation
had entered was right and that we were
on the right side. He said, however,
that as great and as important as this
present war is, that Jesus Christ was the
leader in the spiritual conflict and that
if a decision must be made in regard to
volunteering, that it was the duty of
ministerial students to be loyal to their
Maker. Dr. Bradley added that he
thought the life of one absolutely conse-
crated minister of the Gospel was doing
more materially to hasten the coming of
our Lord than all the armed forces in
Europe. Closing this part of his speech
with an account of the great work of Dr.
DuBose in driving opium out of China
after 50 years of consecrated and ecarn-
est labors, Dr. Bradley made an appeal
for the lives of some of those present to
do great things for the cause of Christ
not only in China but in all parts of the
world.

After this the speaker gave a few im-
oression of his work in China. He spoke
of having gone to his work 18 years ago
and started his medical practice in a
‘ong, narrow, low-ceiled building with +
brick floor. His outfit consisted of a
chest of medicines and a few instruments
he said, and his operating table was a
wooden door resting on temporary sun-
ports. Patients who had to remain in
the hospital for any length of time were
put in several out-rooms or beds made
of a wooden support covered with corn-
stalks and a few Chinese quilts. Today,

Large Audience Hears
Ex-Gov. Patterson

Davidson Wins From
Washington and Lee

“The Mind of a Nation” is Strong|Generals Are Defeated On Our Own

Plea for Prohibition.

Last Friday evening the citizens of
Davidson and the students of the college
had the pleasure of hearing a lecture by
ex-Gov, M. R. Patterson, of “Tennessee.
Mr. Patterson gave an address brimful
of “pep” and patriotism on the great na-
tional interests of the day.

The subject of his address was, “Phe
Mind of the Nation.” Briefly his speech
was as follows:

At the outbreak of the war we were a
pleasure-loving people whose main am-
bitions were to make money and have
a good time. We had developed won
derfully in’ a material way at the ex-
pense of ideals and manhood, and our
country was on the verge of national
decadence. As soon as we entered the
war we were able to supply seven bil-
lién dollars for the carrying on of the
war, but were unable to put one man on
the firing line. For this reason America
has had the humiltating experience ot
having to go to school to France and
England in order to learn the art. of
fighting, When war was declared
agamst Germany our sense of
tional patriotism was almost dead, but
under the stress of the times co-operation
is developing efficiency.

The chief cause of our natianl decad
ence was the liquor traffic. “Phis heinous
business had taught us lack of self-res-
straint and had even corrupted govern
ment and jnstice. “Then because pre-
vention is better than a cure the first
real step to a national conscience is to
close every brewery and distillery and
saloon in this nation.

It is a big proposition to wipe out such
«mighty evil but such things have been
done. In our own country our mind has
changed on many things and some great
evils have been abolished. One of them
was duelling, another the Louisiana Lot-
tery, still another was slavery, and the
next will be the saloon.

The saloon must go because — it
wasteful and unpatriotic. In this coun
try last year there were 60,729.509 bar
rels of beer brewed. This required
7,530,395 tons of coal and 68,400,000
bushels of grain, which was capable of
being used for food. In this time when
churches, schools and business houses are
closing for days and weeks in order to
conserve the coal supply, not a single
saloon or brewery has closed its doors.
In this time when there is such urgent
need for all possible transportation facili-
ties the breweries have used miles of
cars to carry their products and have

Floor by Wildcats.

Davidson opened her 1918 basketball
season by winning from Washington and
Lee on their home floor Friday night.
Vhe final score was, Davidsan, 33; W.
& L., 20. The Generals were expecting
a rather easy time, but the “Wild Cats,”
led by Hengeveld and King, proved too
much for them. For such a defeat on
her home floor, Washington and Lee: his
no alibi to offer—the visitors just out-
played them.

No news wits received from the V. M.
I. and B. P. 1. games in time for publi-
cation, but we're expecting the team to
“keep up the good work.”

MINISTERIAL BAND MEFTS.

The Ministerial Band held its regular
ineeting last Sunday evening as usual.
The following question was discussed:
“The relation of the minister to activi-
ties exclusive of the weekly preparation
and delivery of sermons.”

W. C. Frierson. D. W. Roberts and
W. C. Cumming led in the discussion,
emphasizing the necessity of the minister
undertaking outside activities of some
kind. They in turn pointed out the
following outside activities which might
well engage the attention of the minister:
the organization of Bible — classes, the
writing for newspapers and periodicals,
and the visiting the sick and the inmates
of prison. Then the discussion was
thrown open and it was unanimously de-
cided that the minister to be truly suc-
cessful must engage in some outside ac-
tivities similar to those mentioned.
