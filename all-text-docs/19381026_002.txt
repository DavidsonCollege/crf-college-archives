Explanation . . .

It has been recently called to our attention
that editorials, letters, and columns in The
Davidsonian sometimes make references to

misconduct in “chapel” which might be

misunderstood by .s0me who have never
. s \ ‘ ge

attended Davidson and are not familiar

with its curriculum,

To these we would hasten to explain that
our chapel period is divided into two parts,
the devotional service and the “assembly,”
or student body meeting, During the former

‘our behavior is usually quite exemplary.

The misconduct referred to is the horse
play and frolicking carried on during the
assembly.

More Letters...

It is with no small amount of pride that
we turn out an editorial page this week con-
taining twice the usual number of “Letters
to the Editor.” Perhaps this is a sign that
more students are doing some thinking
along constructive lines and are taking a
interest the paper. We hope
that this will not just prove to be a “ban-

greater in

ner week,” after which this department will

sink back into its usual rather neglected
state,

In a student body poll taken last year one

of the main criticisms of the paper was that

it did not contain enough student opinion.
This criticism is not properly directed at the
paper, but should be aimed at the student
body which has failed to utilize this ever-
present space for voicing its opinion.

Campus Comments

One of Davidson's admirable qualities is
her friendligess. There. is a deep spirit
of cordiality here that works its way into
every appreciative student so much that his
warmness becomes a part of him.

We pride ourselves in the fact that we
speak to each other whenever we pass on
the campus. We are noted for our “Howdy,
Gentlemen,” that marks Davidson

us as

men,

We should be proud of this tradition and
every man should see to it that he himself
helps preserve it}, Every man should speak
to other Davidson men whether he knows
his name or not. We ought to be proud of,
yet endeavor to preserve, this mark of dis-
tinction,

We must not become lax in speaking.
We should keep Davidson a college cam-
pus noted for its friendliness.

Cordially,
—FRED STAIR.
President of Student Body.

of the Senior Class, to write the next Cam-
pus Comments. z

By TOM PERRIN

SET-UP .. . Theoretically a
dance week-end is a seféup for the
columnist. We got that from a
veteran of both columns and week-
ends. But it isn’t particularly true
for us, to judge from results of the
recent festivities. All our agents
bring us is gossip. Legend has it,
though, that Chubby King, who
did something in the Snooper field
last functioned best just
about one blink this. side of sleep.
Being in a semi-somambulistic state
yet ourselves, maybe we can find
words.

STORIES ... The dances did
bring material of a sort, of course.
There is the story, for instance of
the girl who unpacked

That must be the
fate that can fall
to a girl — arriving for a dance
set without her “things.”

Then there was one, who finding
the picture of her escort in an old
annual, exclaimed: “Oh, you're in
the Ministerial Band! What do you
play?"

isterial Band reminds of the

who covered one of the meetings
of that group. He turned in a
very nice story about the visiting
pastor addressing the “Minstrel
Band.” Those rollicking trouba-
dours !

FROSH ... Why freshmen get
the credit for being so dumb when
they are only nine months away
from their intellectual prime—ask
any sophomore — is more than we
can say. But after what we over-
heard at the Carolina game we
can't very well defend the frosh. A
couple of red-caps- had watched
Carolina’s Lalanne sling a smooth
pass for a considerable gain.
“Break his arm,” screamed one.

“Wouldn't do. any good,” said
the other, sadly but wisely. “He'd
throw it with the other arm. He's
ambiguous.”

WONDERS OF THE WEEK ..
How under the’ sun do girls man-
age to act and look so fresh after
a dance set that leaves tough ath-
letes looking pretty wilted?

And why can't the other half of
the freshman class be induced to
attend pep meetings.

I do not refer to recently elected
student members when | say that
an exaggerated concern has been
shown over just who may have the
opportunity to show off their prow-
ess along scholastic

pealing to faculty power? Ruskin

Where have they been forced to

AUDITING

Isn't it your impression that one
of Davidson's purposes is to foster

the spirit of individual initiative
in its students? That was my im-
pression also, until I found that

pose. This tradition dictates that,

cation. By the time we have reach-
ed our last year, we find that we
have not been able to study nearly
everything that we wanted to. If

we majored in the sciences, we
discover that our thirst for the
arts, or social sciences, or even

other sciences has merely been in-
creased. On the other hand, a ma-

effort to make the most of our
opportunities,
What is meant by “auditing?”

As I understand it, auditing is the
attendance of classes in which a
student is not officially enrolled, so
that he may get some value from
the professor's

lectures without
feeling the pressure of additional

class-load. The student does not
appear on the roll, is not even a
member of the class; he merely

visits and’ listens.

What are the advantages? First,
it gives the student a chance to
survey fields of knowledge which
the present system holds from him
because of the time and load fac-

tors. Second, it permits a student
to sit-in on a class he has pre
viously studied, so that he may

further perfect himself in that sub-

Ject. A student cannot possibly
drink a single course dry in a
single term; auditing the class

would permit him to gather much
that had escaped him.

And the objections? First, suclt
practice would disturb classes.
How many men, who are interested
enough in a subject to attend
classes when not required to, are
the disturb classes? A
protessor should feel complimented
by such a practice, not bothered.
Second, auditing would be against
tradition. This objection I can not
answer; for after all, the tradition
has stood the test of time. It was
good enough for Father so it. is
good enough for me.

Dear Editor:

The first football coach at Dav-
idson was employed in 1900, Prior
to his arrival Clemson beat “Dav-
idson 64 to 0, The remaining games
of that season told a different story.
Davidson defeated State 17-0, S.C.
5-0, Ga. Tech 38-6,

In 1910 under the coaching of
Floyd Simmons of Charlotte this
was the unusual record. Davidson
made 213 points to the opponents

tawba 0; Davidson 57, Lenoir 0;
Davidson 6, V. P. I. 16; Davidson 6,

There are still plenty of good
football players at Davidson and
we have efficient coaches, but the
competition is much more formid-
able, for the southern teams are
now playing a brand of football

the middle west. ;
