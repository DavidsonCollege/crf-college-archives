Meeting Held Tuesday Night to Dis-
cuss Plans for a Vigorous
Campaign

“Hoover for President!” Monday
morning chapel saw the first definite
signs in Davidson of the coming
presidential campaign. Dr. Lingle
started the ball to rolling several
days before, when he announced a
student body meeting on Monday to
consider the question, and it seems
as if Hoover 1s going to be David-
son’s choice for the Democratic
nomination, for there was an over-
fiow of enthusiasm evidenced. _

Louis P. Good was chosen chair-
man of the meeting, and after talks
by Dr. Lingle and Dr. Arbuckle, ar-
dent Hooverites, a combined meet-
ing with the Polity Club was ap-
pointed for Tuesday night at 7
o'clock. The band was to be present
and everyone was urged to attend.
For this meeting was not for Hoov-
er only, but for a discussion of the
presidential possibilities with a view
of presenting Hoover as the best
man for the position of chief execu-
tive of our country. It was propos-
ed to have all students and faculty
members possible to attend the
Tuesday night mass meeting, and to
have them come loaded with politi-
cal speeches, for the most prominent
men in the student body were to be
called upon for their views.

From this meeting a-Hoover club
will be formed, with a view of help-
ing present him as the Democratic
nominee for President, and to con-
tinue the good work till a man bet-
ter qualified is found or until he is
eliminated from the race. The fol-
lowing are the resolutions presented
to the mass meeting:

“The present national and inter-
national situation is such as to con-
vince us that during the next presi-
dential term the subjects that will
loom especially large are diplomatic
problems and foreign commerce and
finance on the one hand, and the
whole domestic industrial situation
with its consequent labor and capital
conflicts on the other. The isolation
of our country, and the formation of
leagues of any kind against us must
be prevented at all costs, or else the
most aggressive measures for na-
tional defense must be undertaken.

“We believe it the duty of every
American citizen to use his voice and
influence in favor of a man for the
presidency, who, on the whole, is the
best qualified to deal with such far-
reaching problems as confront us at
abroad at the present

home an
hour.

“The large mold in which the mind
of Mr. Herbert Hoover is cast; his
extensive experience in large busi-
ness and his apparently comprehens-
ive grasp of the domestic economic
situation in the broadest sense of the
term; his wide knowledge of Eu-
trope and of the Orient; his inti-
mate association and personal co-
operation with so many leaders in
the European countries in his efforts
to feed the hungry nations before,
during and after our own war ven-
ture; and withal, his unfailing Amer-
icanism when dealing with the
strong men of other lands constitute
a rare combination such as we see
in no other presidential possibility at
the present hour.

“In view of the above observa-
tions, we, the students and profes-
sors in Davidson Colledge, pledge
ourselves as individuals and in or-
ganization to exert our influence
wherever and whenever possible to

Playing every college in the two
Carolinas except two, during the re-
cent basketball season, winning four
games and lesing nine, a record
which must not be despised at all,
considering the teams encountered,
the Wildcats have every reason to
be proud of their basketball quint.
Of these 13 games, only four were
played on the local floor, the remain-
ing nine being played on two stren-
uous and tiresome trips.

During the early part of the sea-
son, the team was hampered a great
deal and as a result, got under way
with a heavy handicap. When prac-
tice began there were only three
men of last year’s Varsity back:
Chalmers, Schenck and Hall. Har-
tington was kept out of play by doc-
tors’ orders. In the very first game,
the team suffered the misfortune of
losing Schenck, stellar guard, when
he wrenched his knee severely. He
was unable to play any more of the
season.

In the first game, which was with
the University of N. C., on the hill,
the Wildcats trounced the Tar
Babies 31 to 20. The team left ona
five-day trip through North Carolina
the following week, and lost to each
of the fullowing teams, Guilford
29-22, N. C. State 30-10, Wake For-
est 24-12, U. of N. C. 23-22, Elon
24-18. The spectacular stand made
against the University at Chapel
Hill featured the trip. Returning
home, the Clemson Tigers got away
with a 28 to 26 victory. The pro-
posed Virginia trip was cancelled on
account of the violent form the in-
fluenza had taken in that state. The
University of S. C. was taken into
camp next 27 to 25, in the most ex-
citing game on the local floor. The
squad next left on a four-day in-
vasion of South Carolina. In the
first game, Wofford was smothered
38 to 17. ‘The next two games were
dropped to Clemson 38-27, and P. C.
37-30. On the final day of the trip,
the University was again beaten, b
a 27 to 17 score. In the game wit
N. C. State, a day after the trip back
from Columbia, the Wildcats lost to
the Tech quoint, 37 to 19.

The summary gives the quint a

record of four games won, and nine
lost. Even though they were thus
outgamed 2 to 1, the opponents onl
rolled up 349 points against David-
son’s 310.
’ In Coach Hengeveld, the team had
a man who was always on the job,
ready with plenty of suggestions as
to playing the game. The “Coach's”
patience and perseverance was won-
derful, he always being there to dis-
pute any argument not in favor of
the five, even after the disastrous N.
C. trip.

Manager Allison was a peach. The
trips planned, gave Davidson a
chance to meet practically every
team in the Carolinas. e team
was entertained at the best places
possible while on the trips, and
“Bob” was popular — especially
around meal time.

In Captain Chalmers at guard the
team had a leader who never knew
the word “lose” until the final whis-
Gd
bring about the nomination and
election of Mr. Hoover as President
of these United States, to persevere
in this effort until success is attain-
ed, or until we are convinced of the
availabitity of a better qualified man,
and to this end we hereby form ‘The
Hoover Club of Davidson College.’ ”

tle blew. He was on the job con-
stantly, encouraging the men and
putting a new impetus into the play.
“D. M.” will graduate this year and
his loss to the team both as player
and captain will be keenly felt.

Brice took care of the other guard
position. “S. D.” was the quickest
man in footwork on the team and his
spectacular dribbles through the op-
posing five was baffling indeed.
Toward the end of the season Brice
was locating the basket accurately
and made an ideal running guard.

Romefelt, alternating at center
and guard, was the mainstay of the
defense. Time after time the op-
ponent’s offense ended with “Ro-
meo” the stumbling block. Besides
his defensive work, Romefelt also
was second highest individual scorer
on the team.

Hall, better known as “Prep,”
held down one of the forward posi-
tions. “Prep” was not used on the
offensive much, but was a mainstay
in the floor work and assisted great-
ly in defensive work. _He will also
graduate, having played on the team
for thé’past two years.

‘Roberts, at the other forward, was
the mainstay of the offensive. The
Wilntingtun lad shot baskets of the
spectacular variety from any angle,
and will run a close race for an all-
star forward position. “Bill” scored
half of the points made by the Wild-
cats.

Striebeck, long, lanky center, as-
sured the Red and Black quaint of
the tip-off at any time he was jump-
ing, and was thus responsible for
the beginning of any offensive at-
tack launched. “High Pockets” will
be back next year, and great things
are being looked for with him at the
center position.

SCHENCK AND CURRIE TO
LEAD Y. M. C. A. NEXT YEAR

At a meeting of the Y. M. C. A.
which comprises the entire student
body, last Monday morning, Lewis
Schenck was elected president of the
Y.M.C.A.; A. L. Currie, vice-presi-
dent, and Julian P. Price, secretary.

The office of president is only
open for next year’s Seniors and the
office of secretary for those who will
be Juniors.

reat interest was shown in the
election due to the fact that the stu-
dent body realizes the responsibility
of these positions which have been
so ably filled for the past few years.
There was much speculation among
the students as to who would be
elected from the four nominees to
direct the work of the “Y” which
lays such an important part in the
life of every Davidson man on the
campus. These men who have been
selected from so large a student
body on their fitness for service are
to be congratulated for their new
achievements. By co-operating with
them in their year’s work, which be-
gins April 1, we hope to make as-
sured a great success for the “Y”
during this year and greater possi-
bilities for the future.

Over One | Hundred Delegates Ex-
rogram to be an
Pees Excellent One

The time has come when The Da-
vidsonian can do what has been an-
ticipated for some while. A hearty
welcome is hereby given to each and
every delegate to the Davidson cam-
pus, and to the privileges of the col-
lege while in attendance on the An-
nual Conference of the Student Vol-
unteer Union of North Carolina for
Foreign Missions.

Davidson has been active for the
past few weeks in making final prep-
arations for the conference. The
committee that was appointed by
the Y. M. C. A. has had charge of
registration of delegates and they
report that 84 delegates have, regis-
tered thus far. These 84 delegates
represent 17 institutions. Several
institutions have not sent in their
list at the present writing. It is re-
gretted that Carolina College and
the University of North Carolina
have not seen their way clear to send
delegations.

There has been no announcement
of a program in its detailed form.
There have been chosen, however, a
list of speakers. Most of these are
definitely assured and a few are con-
fidently expected although it is not
certain that they will come. The
list includes Dr. J. Lovell Murray
and Miss May Fleming, who come
as representatives of the New York

in this work. Mr. D. W. Newson, of
Trinity College, is expected along
with Miss Helen Hardy, represent-
ing the Methodist Board. Rev. J. F.
Preston, missionary of Soonchun,
Korea, will represent the Southern
Presbyterians; Dr. Jno. W. Wood,

lingham, the Baptists; Mr. J. E.
Johnson, Student Secretary of the
Carolinas in Y. M. C. A. activities,

hopes to attend.

The opening exercises of the con-
ferences will be held in the church
as soon as is convenient after the
8:06 train runs on Friday night. At
this service necessary announcement
will be made concerning the coming
services. All the services on Satur-
day will be in the church. At these
notice will be given concerning the
Sunday services. .

The arrangements of the local
committee include entertaining the
delegates Saturday afternoon at an
informal social gathering under the
auspices of the Y. M.C. A. Saturday
evening all delegates will be admit-
ted free to the Lyceum attraction,
if they present delegate’s tickets at
the door.

For the benefit of students who

may wish to help in the work and!

Baseball in Full Swing—Squad Cut to
Thirty Men—More “Pep” Than
Ever Before Shown

In spite of the fact that the can-
didates for the 1920 nine have thus
far been handicapped by unusually
cold weather, baseball ‘practice is
now in full swing. Coach Henge-
veld’s charges are hard at work,
either trying to sew up positions for
the first time or to hold down those
won in previous years, so a hot con-
test is being staged for practically
every position.

Almost 60 men answered the first
call for practice, but this number
was considered too large for the best
interests of the Varsity, and it was
found necessary to reduce the num-
ber by half. ‘Thirty of the most
promising candidates were selected
to continue practice under super-
vision of the coach. Prospects for
the selection of a winning team from
this material seem unusually bright
and if half the “pep” is manifested
in the games that is being shown in
practice, Davidson's rivals will have
their hands full when they line up
against the Presbyterians.

The infield, though somewhat of
an aggregation of midgets, looks un-
usually good and is already showing
great speed and excellent teamwork.
Eris Cassell is back in his old place
on the hot corner, and is handling
that position in great style. The fast
third sacker is covering more

office, and who are both experienced | ground this year than ever before.

For the shortstop position, Cassell,
F., seems to be about the best bet.
Sample, who held down that post
last season, is handicapped by a bad

‘arm and will probably not be able to

get it in condition this season. Huff-
stetler is also making a strong bid

the Episcopalians; Mrs. Foy Wil-! for the place, and is showing great

form. At the keystone position,

‘Ratchford is taking everything that

comes his way, and promises to en-

has assured the committee that hei joy his best season yet. McArn and

Sutton, both letter men, are staging
a battle royal for the possession of
first base, with the odds a little in
favor of the former, Either of them
should be able to hold down the first
sack in great style. Crawford and
Rarnette are also showing up well
for this position.
_ In the outfield, Johnnie Richards
is the only member of last year’s
team to return, The big left-fielder
is wielding the slap-stick in his old-
time form and is fielding his position
unusually well. Shepherd and Poe,
two new men, are also playing well
in the outer gardens and at present
seem to have the edge on the other
competitors. Irwin, L., Miley, G.,
Crawford, and Barnette, are by no
means out of the running, however.
The main problem at present is
that of the pitchers’ staff, Captain
Currie and “Bill” Miley, who have
hurled for the Red and Black for the
past two years, can be depended on
to bear the brunt of the burden in
this line, but one or two new men
will be needed. Shepherd and Sor-
tells seem to be about the strongest
contestants for this position, though
the low temperature has prevented
all of the pitchers from showing any
real stuff.
The catching should be well taken
care of this season. The two con-
testants for this position are John-
son and Wrenn. So far it is a toss-
up as to who will come out ahead.
Johnson did the receiving work for
the Wildcats in 1919, while Wrenn
has played for Oak Ridge and also
on one of the teams of the A. E. F.
