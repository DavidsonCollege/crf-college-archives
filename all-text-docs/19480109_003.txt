Spring Football
Begins Feb. 2

Monday, February 2, marks the

beginning of spring football practice
at Davidson, according to Coach
“Charley” Jamerson, new “big chief”
of the football squad. The reason for
the early start is to give the boys
time to play football and then go
out for track or baseball. The squad
will work out for six straight weeks.
which is a deviation from the old
policy of working three, resting, and
working three more.

Coach Jamerson is making an
ardent plea for anyone with any
football experience at all, in high
school or elsewhere, to come out to
try out for the-team,-He-—is-expect-
ing all of this year’s J. V. team and
would also like to have those boys
who didn't play J. V. this year but
who have had any experience. “The
more men out, the better the team,”
says the coach, and an even better
than last year's is what he’s hoping
for, There'is, as he says, a place for
éveryone on the team

In the however, there
will be a few changes, The squad
will suffer the loss of very few men
this year, but these few places will
be hard to fill, One of these will be
the loss of ny Richards, who
is planning o tending the naval
academy. This will leave the center
post empty. Also the

lineup,

on missing

list will be Strickland and Bill Boyd, |

who is going to dental school,

Wildkittens Take
Lees-McRae, 61-49

Davidson's Wildkitten basketball
squad handed Lees-McRae’s game
quintet a 61-49 licking Thursday |
night in the Davidson gym with |
Henry Neisler and Dutch Henge |
veld vieing for top scoring honors
with ten points each. The Jayvee
squad was augmented by six of the
boys who work out with the var-
sity.

Behind at Half

Lees-McRae led 31-30 at the half.
They played a fast moving game
that swept over the Jayvee de-
fense for a 10-point lead midway
through the first half. Fast break-
ing and good rebound work gave
the McRae boys their edge. At this
point a Hopper-Bingham-Roddey-
Hengeveld-Neisler quintet with sub-
stitute Bud Aiken pulled up within
one point of the visitors as the half
ended,

This same aggregation started
the second half and ran up a size-

able lead in their 10 aiminutes of
play, When the Jayvees took over,
they had smooth sailing all the

way in and gave the whole squad
;a chance to play.

HIGH POINT ‘Y'

The Davidson College grapplers
turned in their most decisive
triumph of the season when they
trounced the High Point Y grap-
This marked the first
Charlie Parker's
matmen since Christmas, and from
all the Cats have
proved greatly since the month of
December. ‘Their long hours of
practice seem to have paid off final-
Jy, and it looks like the Cats will
field a pretty fair aggregation in
the coming Southern Conference
wrestling engagements.

With exams bearing down

Armehair sports analysists who consider comparative scores
the standard for judging teams must have gotten a shock
when the Wildeats beat Duke after taking a drubbing from
Hanes Hosiery Mills after the Dukes had downed the semi-
pros. Chances for a repeat with State were pretty much blown
to the winds with Mike Williams out probably until after
exams with a sprained ankle, and most people were willing
to spot State twenty points. However, such predictions failed
to foresee that Whit Cobb, high seorer to date, would hit a
scoring slump.

Slamps come almost inevitably to a player sometime in
the season, and probably it’s lucky that Whit hit his with the
cards already stacked against the ‘Cats. The slump lasted
‘against South Carofina, with the whole team joining in, Mon-
day night's 62-35 triumph was slight compensation for the
conference loss at S.C. Conference wins will be hard to get
from here on and if the ’Cats see action in tHe conference
playoff in March, they can’t afford any more bad nights.

Coneeding none but to the giants from the eastern part of
the state, we still have a fifty-fifty chance of breaking into
the conference lineup with an eleven wins-seven losses record.
With four gone and three in our favor’already, we face State
and Duke onee again, and U.N.C. twice. There is a chance that
we can take UNC. either or both games. The next Duke game
comes the hight after we play ENC. there, and a lot depends
on that game as to how we can siack up against Duke, How-
ever, it is asking too muchoof an inexperienced squad to ex-
pect totwin in Tar Heel territory, and only with the best of
breaks can the Wildeats take these big boys

With exam period to whip back into shape after the recent
reverses, we aren't conceding anything to the other-eight op-
ponents, ially Sow Carolina's Who may
well remember Clemson's fate last year on the Wildeat home
eourt

With Mike temporarily laid up, Whit Cobb looked like @
natural to walk off With individual scoring honors until the
State and South Carolina games slowed down the Durham
ball of fire. To date. he has a grand total of 141 points in 11
games fora 12.8 point average. Buddy is rapidly closing the
wap with 133 points and a 12 point per game average. Mike
Williams has a game average of 14 points, but has only played
in eight eames. His totale 18 points, was only two points be-
hind Whit’s after the Duke game,

JoD. Ashmore and dgkeMills hold fourth and fifth places
with 75 atid 63. pots, wespectively. Bill Iverson's 36 points
are vood for sixth place, ;

Bad luck is always a good excuse, so they say. If so, David-
son never lacks for @&euses, because any good Davidsonian
can tell vou that the two things Davidson is famous for is rain
and athletic bad luck. Let's all add a little to our incense to
Dame Fortune during exams and hope she can smile more
favorable on the ‘Cats next semester,

Coach Redding’s Jayvees are a serappy crew with lots of
speed for collegiate neophytes, and some height, Their shoot-
ing is nane too accurate, but that will come in time. Their
captain, Melvin Griffith, a Davidson home town boy, reminds
us a lot of Kd White on the court. His floor play and lots of
his lay-up shots bring back memories of last year’s Wildcat
captain.

Tommy Halley, Johnny Kelton, and one of the laweett
{wins are other freshinen who show considerable promise.
Johnny Richards, Dick Blanks, and Lenoir Keesler uphold the
upperelassman tradition for the Kittens, :

Best wishes to Coach Barton on his tournament tour ‘this
winter, After holidays in Bermuda, the coach is making the
rounds of the tournaments until the first of Mareh when he
will return to the campus to begin activities with the tennis
team. i

Jimmy Jung, the dimunitive pride of Davidson's wrestling
efforts, has plenty of that old intestinal fortitude. Coming» in
for special praise again, Jim wasn’t bluffed when the Winston
erapplers couldn't put up a man in his weight class, He
stepped up into the next class and took on veteran AAU
