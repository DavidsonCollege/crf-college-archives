fraught with no little danger as well as:
discomfort. ,

same as it has in former days. Billy
Sunday, W. J. Bryan and Woodrow |
Wilson were mentioned as good expo-
nents of present day oratory. The fact
was also recalled that the last named
gentleman got his start in one of the
Davidson. societies. Another advantage |
of the societies as brought out by Pro-
fessor Currie was that it taught pari |
mentary law and how to conduct any
public meeting. |

Following Professor Currie’s address
the feed proper took place. An effort
was made to keep a record and see who
had the most insatiable appetite. The
score keepers not having an adding ma-
chine lost count, but the general opin-
ion was that the honors should be equal--
ly divided between Spence and Worth.
It is rumored that these two gentlemen
forewent their regular evening repast in
anticipition of the event.

After the eats short talks were made
by Askew, Sullivan and McGirt, off-
cers of the Eumanean Society.

At the call of President Chalmers, all
the Phi. members pledged renewed al-
legiance to the society and promised to
work harder in the future.

The following men made known
their intention of joining the society at
the next regular meeting: C. W. Lew-
is, G. D. Farmer, L. ¥. White, F. S.
Johnston, J: R. Jones, J. B. McCallum,
H. S. Northrop, B. C. Thompson and
M. J. Murry.

After a yell for the Eu’s and then
one for the Phi’s, the festivities came to
an end. ,
