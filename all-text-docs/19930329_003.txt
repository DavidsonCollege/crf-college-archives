Emergency Medical Technicians Face Life and Death Decisions Daily

By Tara Pyne

4 a.m. - Sleep permeates the
air but a few are still awake. They
are not studying for reviews, writ-
ing papers or conjugating verbs
but saving lives. David Nieland,
John Harper, Allison Dorbandt,
Whit Pepper,
Willingham all participate in the
Emergency Medical Technician
program in Mecklenburg County.
Presently the program is serving

25,000 citizens withapproximately
1,000 calls each year.

Allison Dorbandt enjoys vol-
unteering for the E.M.T. program
because she believes, “‘Itisa chance
tosee the real world and be a part of
thecommunity outside of Davidson
activities.” The students must as-
sess and stabilize a patient’s condi-
tion until they can be transported to
a hospital. Allison admits that the
job can be tedious at times because

Actually reaching patients can be a challenge. David Nieland and
Whit Pepper pry open a car's door after an accident last week.

in some cases people do not want
to be helped. In one case she tried
to help a man, but he violently
threw his bloody shirt at her.
Allison says, “It only takes one
time before you learn not to go in
by yourself.”

The rewarding part, says
David Nieland, “Is being able to
help and knowing that a college
student can make a difference.”
Dave had the opportunity to make
a difference when the regular staff
was away on a retreat one week-
end. One staff member and four
Davidson students were called to
an accident scene to dislodge two
people from an overturned car. “In
that case Davidson students made
the difference between life and
death for those people.”

The road to becoming an
E.M.T. demands dedication and
time. Each of Davidson’sE.M.T.'s
spent 135 hours learning proper
procedures and care foremergency
medical situations ranging from
basic C.P.R. to complex child-
births. In addition to classroom
time the students also had to par-
ticipate in clinical rotations in the
emergency room for eight hours.
What most people do not realize is
the complexity of anE.M.T.’strain-
ing. They are not only instructed
in basic procedures like C.P.R. but
complicated techniques such as
cutting people out of mangled cars
without causing further injury to
the patient. Many of our E.M.T.’s

were certified at Davidson last year
between October and February in
a three hour class every Tuesday
and Thursday.

Understandably, E.M.T.’ssee
more than their fair share of sad
situations. Whit Pepper says, “It’s
scary when you see people our age,
dead. Think about it... When that
guy went out he wasn’t thinking,
“I’m going to get killed tonight’ -
he was’ just like the rest of us.”
Whit admits that witnessing so
many tragic accidents has really
changed his way of thinking and
instilled a sense of responsibility.
Responsibility is a large part of
being an E.M.T. Davidson stu-
dents are responsible for saving
people’s lives on a daily basis and
that kind of task cannot be taken
lightly. As Whitsums itup, “Ifyou
screw up - It’s real!” There is no
next time or makeups.

Obviously, E.M.T.’s are in-
volved in many tense situations
and have to find some outlet for
release, Whit Pepper explains,
“While you are on the scene you
don’t think about what you are
doing.

"You just do your job.

"It’s not until you get back to
the station that you think about
what has justhappened.” The easi-
est way for the E.M.T’s to relieve
some of their stress is to talk about
what has just happened with other
members of their crew.
these talks that a strong bond is
formed between notonly Davidson
student E.M.T.’s but the whole
staff. Listeners may. think they are

It’s in

being crass but for them it is a
means of release and even relax-
ation.

In the words of Deborah
Bacchus, the paramedic crew chief,
“Davidson E.M.T.’s are our extra
hands. They are trained individu-
als who can help us reach more of
the community.” A wonderful
example of this would be in the
case of Alfredo Urbino, who was
injured on campus a couple of
months ago in a fraternity acci-
dent.

Allison Dorbandt and Whit
Pepper were able to respond im-
mediately to the situation because
they were on campus. Another
incident that expands beyond the
bounds:of Davidson occurred dur-
ing Allison’s spring break. She
and her friends were on the way to
Florida when they noticed an over-
turned car on the highway. Allison
was able to offer immediate care to
the girls trapped in the car.

In both situations, Davidson
Students' medical knowledge
helped secure the situations until
further medical care could be ob-
tained.

Certification for a student is

* an honorable feat considering the

balance they have to find between
the demands of Davidson’s course
load and medical rescue instruc-
tion. Though being an E.M.T. can

_ be tedious at four in the morning,

there are definite rewards. The

. feeling of being an altruistis some-
. thing that cannot be described by

words but must be felt to muly be
appreciated. sf

Angelou Career Controversial

Maya continued from page 2

Lordly & Dame, Inc., Angelou is
one of the greatest female lecturers
of our time and “believes in social
change for the betterment of those
who have yet to share fully in the
American dream.” .

In her lectures that she has
given throughout the country and
abroad Angelou shares the black
experience and educates her audi-
ence on the human condition.
Through songs, poems, and stories
she “leaves every audience visibly
moved by each performance.”

Dr. Kimmel, on the Public
Lectures Committee, said, “She
can be electrifying; I expect she
will given appearance like that in

Love Auditorium. She is a per-
former. She is going to give a
performance over there.” He
continued to say that Angelou will
“generate response through the
power of her words and the power
of her performance.”

T.K. Tibby, a member of the
Committee, said, “She is a dy-
namic person.”

Inregard to the controversy at
Wake Forest, Tibby commented
that, “A lotof people look for flaws
in public figures... Maya has other
duties outside her responsibilities
at Wake Forest.”

Directly proceeding Angelou's
lecture on Wednesday there will
be an open reception in the Cham-
bers Gallery.

cause, “I try to come here every
chance I get.” Meeting fellow
members of the class of 1997 en-
sured Andrea Anderson from Sa-
vannah, Georgia that Davidson
looks promising. Italso looked “im-
pressive” to Ryan Allen of Win-
ston-Salem, yet he admitted that
tuition costs intimidated him.
The Admissions Office and'
Davidson Ambassadors agreed on
the day’s success. Wookie Payne,

Sally Gantt.

Associate Dean of Admissions,

tendance allowed the prospectives
to interact, a crucial factor in a
Student’s decision to enroll. She
wasalso pleased with the wealth of
information parents received.

"The day was successful
thanks to the support from the fac-
ulty, staff, and students,” stated
Davidson Ambassadors President
Once again the
Davidson community shined
through.
