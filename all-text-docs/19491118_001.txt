entirely in Chinese Communists’

out the fact that the curriculum of

equal chance with Communistic

Step Forward Taken
By Campus Clubbers

Within the past two years the
Campus Club has made amazing
progress as is witnessed by the at-
tractive'y furnished Eu Hail, redec-
orated by the club last year. Fairly
recently the organization advanced
another step by renting a boarding
house. Here the members will be
able to eat together, while previous
to this innovation, they were scat-
tered across the campus and down-
meal time. As they were
unable to sit down to a meal en
masse before acquiring the board-
ing house, the members missed
much of the fellowship that comes
a group meeting together
times a day. To correct this
loss, the Campus Clubbers voted
to rent and operate a boarding
house.

‘The house committee, elected by
the members, hired Mrs. G, C. Gib-
son, a qualified dietician, to super-
vise the cooking of the meals and

waiters are selected by the commit-

tee and are employed on a full-time

basis.
Located at 226 South Street, the
house is owned by Mr. T. E.

rented,
Thus far, the boarding house
system has been very successful

and is anticipated by President

Malloy Owen and House Commit-}

tee Chairman Al Gerhardt to con-

tine so.
