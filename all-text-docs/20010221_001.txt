Students anticipate lottery night

By Matt GarrIELD
Sports Editor

Rob Gould ‘04 knew it was bad when his
hall mates began asking on Monday if he
knew about his lottery number.

“Did you see it?” they asked, trying not to
laugh. “You’ve got the last number in the
whole school.”

Sure enough, when the Residence Life
Office released the lottery numbers that will
determine the order in which rooms are as-
signed for next year, Gould’s name was at the
bottom of the list. Number 1498. Dead last.

RLO director Kurt Holmes has a message
for Gould and other students with low lottery
numbers: The system works.

For more than a decade, his office has used
a randomly calculated lottery system to as-
sign rooms. The numbers are released in mid-
February, and two months later, on “Lottery

Night”, students wait in line for up to several .

hours, waiting to choose an available dorm.

This year, students across campus—espe-
cially those with low numbers who will have
to stand in line while hundreds before them
make their decisions—are wondering if
there*s a betté€f Way to doit:

Increased technology has enabled us to
register for classes, check our grades, and

vote, all from our own computers, some say.
Why can’t we choose our rooms the same
way?

At Furman University in Greenville, S.C.,
students don’t choose their rooms online or
participate in “Lottery Night.”

For the past three years, the school has used
a points system based on seniority to assign
housing. Seniors receive the most points and
freshman the fewest, said Elaine Cross, sec-
retary of University Housing. Students sub-
mit their top eight room choices, and are
assigned a room based on their points total.

“Our room selection process (used to be) so
difficult,” Cross said. “Now, we’ve got it
down pat.”

But Davidson, says Holmes, promotes it-
self as a close-knit, communal environment.
While its system is “hugely labor intensive,”
itreflects the school’s desire to foster interac-
tion among its populace.

“We want students to be able to choose
their rooms,” said Holmes. “With everybody
showing up... You can get a visual of what’s
going on. It’s more hands-on. It makes an
event out of it.”

Union Board slims down

By RICHARD VINSON
Editor-in-chief

In a change described as “monumental”
and “dramatic,”’ the Union Board has reorga-
nized itself in line with its new, streamlined
mission.

After reviewing and reaffirming its mis-
sion and purpose, the Union Board decided to
eliminate or to combine several old commit-
tees. The Board also hopes to eliminate some
of the outdated distinctions between “co-
curricular” and “social” responsibilities.

The end result is a Union Board composed
of twelve instead of twenty-one members
(see chart page 4). In particular, such for-
merly well-known committees as Campus
Forums and Women’s Issues have disap-
peared altogether as Union Board commit-
tees. Some, such as the Intimate Perfor-
mances, Cultural Events, or Literary Arts
Committees, have been absorbed by others.

The Board jettisoned long-time affiliate
Davidson Outdoors. as well. It will now

become an independent organization on cam-
pus.
The Board intends for these changes to

The day be-
gan with tours
of the campus.
From 8:45-10,
tours left Chambers every few minutes. More
than thirty student tour guides led groups.
“We never could have accommodated 500

students and their parents without help from
all the willing tour guides,” said Shannon
Bishop ’03, student tour guide coordinator.
Admission Counselor John Bell agreed with

her and stressed that the program would not :
