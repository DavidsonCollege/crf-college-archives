Autumn Sonata is now playing
at the Park Terrace Theater.
Show times are 3, 4: 40, 6:20, 8,
and 9:40.

Putting together two Berg-
mans and two Ullmans seems
like a combination that can’t
miss. And deliver it does, in
what is possibly director Ing-
mar Bergman’s best film in
years. Autumn Sonata is at
once a complex and compelling
work, both intellectual and
emotional in its power and
beauty. The subject matter is
drawn from Bergman’s strong-
est suit, the intricate relation-
ship between love, hate and
guilt, between freedom and
dependancy.

The story line is deceptively
simple. Eva (Ullman), the wife
of a pastoral minister (Bjork),
has invited her mother to. visit,
as they have not seen each other
for seven years. The mother,
Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman), is
a well-known and busy concert
pianist. Their initial meeting is
a rush of happy, childlike

emotions; yet these emotions.

betray an undercurrent of wari-
ness and fear that warn of
approaching confrontation.

The action of the film takes
place in one day and night,
almost entirely within the con-
fines of Eva’s house. Beginning
with the casual conversations
about recent events in the lives
of the two women, the tension
and hostility start to reveal
themselves. As successive lay-
ers of protective half-lies .and
defenses fall away under Eva’s

President's framretnr ep © expends organizing ability

Of all the offices in Chambers
building there is one that is
reserved for a Davidson gradu-
ate. Each year, the Assistant-to

the President is chosen from |

applicants in the senior class.

The job is a mixture of
important responsibilities and
minor duties, says Cindy Mc-
Dowell, the current President’s
assistant. She feels that being
conscientious and well-orga-
nized is the key to doing the job
well. (If you are interested in
applying, you must talk with
her by April 2nd.)

The major tasks of the As-
sistant to the President involve
the Stuart Scholarship Program
and Spring Convocation. For
Trustee meetings, the Assistant
is in charge of making up the
weekend schedule, writing out
agendas for each meeting and
even planning the menus.

Stuart Scholarship candi-
dates are indebted to the Presi-
dent’s Assistant for arranging
transportation, menus, and ac-

tivities during their stay at
Davidson.

Spring Convocation program-
ming and planning is left en-
tirely to the President’s Assis-
tant. Weeks of preparation go
into engaging: speakers and
coordinating meetings and pro-
ee for Corivocation.

Cindy McDowell, President’s

Assistant. (Phil Howerton)
President serves as an impor-
tant link between the students,
the administration and Dr.
Spencer. The President’s Assis-
tant is a good representative for
the students, having just grad-
uated himself. Students can
voi¢e complaints and sugges-
tions to the Assistant who has
access to the President even
when he is tied up with
meetings and appointments.

In serving on some admini-
strative committees, the As-
sistant can offer the students’
perspective of particular pro-
blems, Communication between

organized by Dr. Spencer’s as-
sistant.

Clearly the Assistant’s job is
a big help to.the administra-
tion; it is also a valuable
internship for the student. Rick
Love, the Assistant to the Pres-
ident three years ago, is still
working in college administra-
tion. Others have used the posi-
tion as a year of practical
training before beginning gra-
duate school.

Like many others, Cindy Mc-
Dowell plans to go to law school
after her term as the President’s
Assistant.

The first woman to hold the
position, Ms. McDowell feels
she has been accepted without
the slightest hesitation from
either the administration or the
Trustees. Her job has been a
rewarding one. Not only has she
sharpened her organizational
skills, but as Assistant to the
President Ms. McDowell has
gained a broader perspective of
Davidson.

She works on an informal
basis with the editor of The
Davidsonian and with the SGA
to clarify controversial issues as
they arise. One example is her
WDAV ‘Rumor Sheet” written
fall-term to make the facts of
the situation available to the
student body. Ms. McDowell’s
participation in the administra-
tion has shown her the hard
work involved in maintaining a
college. She feels that her
experience has strengthened her

glare, the true nature of their
conflict becomes apparent; it is
a conflict that began with Eva’s
birth, and one that cannot be
avoided now.

Eva begins to accuse and
assault her mother, slowly re-
leasing her fury at the years of
neglect and suffocation. Char-
lotte, herself insecure and un-
able to face the responsibility. of
love, gropes desparately for a
way out. But she-cannot escape
the responsibility for the past,
symbolized in the wretched,
spastic disease that is taking
the life of her youngest daugh-
ter Helena, whom Eva and her
husband care for.

In the end, it is Eva who
learns to live with the hate and
the love she harbors for her
mother, and it is Charlotte, who
learns to ask forgiveness.

The film is almost a non-stop
verbal confrontation between
Eva and Charlotte. Cinemato-
grapher Sven Nykvist, who
worked with Bergman on The
Seventh Seal-and@ Persona,
spent untold éffort and care to
follow every shade and nuance
of the script’s emotion and
doubt.

One of the scenes most elo-
quent in showing us the com-
plex relationship of mother and
daughter relies very little on
dialogue. It begins with Eva at
the.piano, performing a hesitant
Chopin prelude for her mother.

Liv Ullman and Ingrid Berg-

most of the new twists in direc-
tor Bergman’s continuing ex-
ploration of the psyche.

This is a film that demands to

the past; Bergman refuses to let
us off any easier.

Time executive to speak

By MATTHEW COVINGTON |

Special to the Davidsonian

Statistics do a poor job of de-
scribing the 1979 Woodrow
Wilson Lecturer, Joan D.
Manley. She is a humble woman
who feels that she has done
nothing innovative in her field,
considers herself a good mana-
ger only because the large
business she runs operetes at a
‘‘reasonable’”’ profit and em-
ploys ‘‘reasonably happy”’
people and she often contem-
plates a comfortable retirement.

But for Manley, Chairman of
the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of Time-Life Books Inc.,
statistics are unavoidable. She
is the most highly paid woman
in American business. Her total
compensation for 1976 was

$203,000. Her company earns

almost half of Time Inc.'s total
profits each year, or about 50
million. At 46, she is the
youngest of Fortune Maga-
zine’s selections for the top 10
women in business. In fact, she
is the youngest, female chief
executive amoung the nation’s
1300 largest companies.
Manley, who is responsible

~ for all book publishing activities

for Time Inc., began her pub-
lishing career as a secretary.
While a senior at the University
of California at Berkley she took
stenography, which she now
refers to as a “smart move.”

She developed her secretarial
skills because she wanted to be °

as fully prepared for a profes-
sion as possible. She advises
women today to do the same,
although being prepared today
may mean an advanced degree
instead of shorthand.

After becoming Assistant. to
the Publisher at Pena’ in
y joined

Time Inc. in 1960. In July 1970
she was appointed Publisher of
Time-Life Books, in July 1971
she was elected as Time Inc.'s
first female Vice President, and
