The Davidsonian

Wildcat Basketball

Davidson College basketball
is on the return.

Quite possibly. the Cats are
trying to make their way into
a very high position before the
Souothern Conference Tour-
nament rolls around in early
March. That is for all the mar-
bles.

Recently Davidson has been
playing like it really has put it
all together after a very shaky
start this season.

The Cats dropped a close
game to Furman in Johnston
Gym, just prior to the Christ-
mas recess. While the other
students were away, the Cats
proceeded to grab the Charlot-
te Invitational Tournament
title for the eighth time in 11
years.

The Cats had to’ whip
Loyola in the opening round,
98-83. while Miami-Ohio

bested a favored squad from
Syracuse. The Cats then went

on to trounce Miami in the
championship game_ the
following night by a score of
97-87.

John Falconi, senior wing
man who has been the leadiing
scorer for the Cats the entire
season, had a_ good _tour-
nament in all departments
and was named the Most
Valuable Player. He had his
highest point total of the
season in the Championship
game as he burned the cords
for 26 points. He also had the
team high rebounding total in
that game with 12.

But Davidson refused to
stop there. They cruised to a
76-62 win over VMI and lost
to a super quick Pittsburg
team, 90-63. Here, it appeared
that the Cats would fold.

They came right back,
however, and rapped the same
Furman team by a score of 91-
76 on the Paladins’ home

court. This win gave the Cats
some true confidence foor the
remainder of the season,
especially as far as the
Southern Conference is con-
cerned.

But the true peak of the
season thus far came Wed-
nesday night in the Charlotte
Coliseum. There, before 9854
screaming fans, the Cats held
a slim margin for most of the
game, then heldoninthe end
for a 70-59 upset of the 11th

ranked South
Gamecocks.

The Cats played their best
game of the season in beating
the Gamecocks for the first
time in three years.

Head coach Terry Holland
sent the team into the game
with one principle objective
designed to bring a victory.
That objective was to force
them into a man-to-man
defense and then get the for-
mer ACC squad into foul

trouble. The Cats succeeded in
both ends of the venture.

The result had to be pleasing
to the hometown fans, who
had hoped that the Furman
upset was not a farce. With the
victory over Frank McGuire
and co., the Cats have proved
otherwise.

Playing for the second time
in as Many outings without the
services of Falconi, Davidson
got tremendous efforts from
the entire team.
