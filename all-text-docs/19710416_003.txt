Leadership in Army ROTC

field. Today at Davidson Col

lege leadership may include
organizing a Red Cross blood
drive or coordinating a series
of speakers on international
events.

1949. “Today they -have 27

“If Davidson College plans
to improve its academic pro-
gram, more funds will be
needed,’’ Cornel] said. ‘‘We
need full time employees who
will research possibilities for
acquiring funds.”’

Spencer presented an opti
mistic picture of Davidson's
financial condition. ‘This col
lege has more endowment
than most of the other
leges in this region. And we
are extremely fortunate to
be beneficiaries of the Duke
Endowment.

“In a study done of 41 in
stitutions, two thirds of the
schools are in financial dif
ficulty or heading toward
it,’’ he said.

“Davidson College has been
in the black for the past two
years,’ said Spencer. ‘‘We
expect to be in the black this
year, and we plan to send a
balanced budget to the Board
of Trustees in May.”

Spencer also said that he
would react favorably to~a
proposal for student repre-

sentatives on the Faculty ;
Budget, Building and
Grounds Committee. ‘‘The

more who can_ understand
about college finances the
better,’’ he said.
