PATTERN FOR CONQUEST
(Continued From Page Three)
With respect to the Russian

charges let us ask ourselves honest-

ly the following questions: Is-it the
intention of the United States to
try to conquer or dominate the
world by economic or forcible
means? Is our ptimary purpose in
sending food and other material aid
to the other peoples of the world
the acquisition of political or eco-
nomic domination over them? Are
our military occupation forces
throughout the world, suci as they
are, there for those purposes? Are
the American people inclined to
Start a war? Are the American peo-
ple and their government moti-
vated by a sincere desire for world
peace? It seems to me that but
little though is required to answer
in the negative all of those ques-
tions except the last one. We often
hear it said that there are sinister

groups that really control our des-
tinies in the United Statés—big
business, trusts or itnernational

cartelists, (formerly it was the mu-
nitions manufacturers) ete.—who
would for profit plunge their coun-
try into war, and therefore, that
it is immaterial what the Ameri-
can people think. T am convinced
that there is no basis for this as-
sumption, —tnquestionabty things
go on in a country such as ours
about which we never learn, and
unquestionably the propagandists
for special interests oftentimes sell
s “bills of goods,” but I ‘remain
convinced that our leaderS both in
government and industry are sin-
cere in their protestations’ against
war and tyranny, and in the offers
of helps which we make to other
countries. Furthermore, | have suf-
ficient faith in the essential de-
mocracy of our system to believe
what our government does is es-
sentially in response to public
opinion. his country will not go to
war until the majority of the peo-
ple assent.

It is to he admitted, of course,
that our present foreign policy has
a military cast to it. We are seek-
ing to maintain bases and _ bridge-
heads and to preserve potentially
valuable alliances. With clouds. of
war on the not too distant horizon,
would we have our government do
otherwise? The intentions back of
those actions clearly appear to be
defensive in nature.

However, let us not delude our-
selves into believing that we are
and always have been perfect in
all respects. We do have national
faults which contribute to the stuff
of which wars are made. For ex-
ample we praise free enterprise and
free competition and yet we are re-
luctant ‘to risk free competition
with the rest of the world, and
obstacles placed in the
trade and the free flow
merce ,have been the basic cause
of many. wars. Looking ahead be-
yond the present crisis there are
many things that we must do that
we have not, yet been willing to do
if we are to make our maximum
contribution to the cause of world
peace. One of those things is that
we must eventually be willing to
trade freely with other countries

the best system of government is
capitalistic democracy. If perchance
they can best us at some parts of

complaint and in the long run we
would profit in everyway through
the stabilization of trade, curren-

In conclusion it would seem that
thoughtful Americans must
clude that the United States is not
bent political or
otherwise; material

con-
upon conquest,
the assistance
that we are offering the world is
first of all being offered for hu-
manitarian reasons and among the
other defensible reasons that
being offered is not to be included
dominates other

it is

a desire to peo-
ples or their governments and the
political philosophy_of the people
of the United States is, to the ex-
tent’ that it affects other govern-
ments, only urged to the “point
of the establishment of
governments which are truly repre-
sentative of the peoples involved.
We are opposed to the imposition
by force of governments not of
their own citizen's choosing. What
form of government those people
choose of their on free will is a
matter of political indifference to
us. Our present bitter opposition to
the Russian government springs
not from a national desire on our
part to change that form of gov-
ernment but from the belief that
that government today constitutes
a major menace to our security and
to the security of the established
governments of other, nations.

In- part two of this paper the
Russian objectives, intentions and
course of conduct bearing on those
objectives and intentions will be
offered and discussed,

Just what s meant when we
speak of the Social Action of the
Y? It means applying the Christian
religion to our relationships in
society, or the putting of Christian
beliefs into action. Through this
department we are able to learn
and impart knowledge pertaining
to the Christian religion.

Last year the principal way of
attaining this aim was through a
discussion group composed of stu-
dents from Davidson and Johnson
C.- Smith University in— Charlotte:
Since one of the problems of our
time is the racial question, the: dis-
‘cussions with these colored stu-
dents did much to increase har-
mony between the two groups, and
helped us to better understand
their point of view. The Tntercol-

cussion: “Plans for starting this
group.are under way, and all those
desiring, to meet with a group of
colored ‘students should see John
Miller, head of the Social Action
Department.

Also,.in order that the entire stu-
dent body may better understand
the colored people, the Y: is plan-
ning.to have Dr. Jones speak to us
