ufy there yrwas the
popular ‘question
asked by many of
the boys upon re-
turning from
Woodberry ‘Forest
last Sunday. It’s al-
most easier to an-
swer the question,
“What didn’t hap-
pen up there?” I
don’t think I’m ex-
aggerating when I
say that two thirds
of the team had
colds when_ they

went on the field to meet Woodberry, and that icy Virginia
wind was enough to make the other one third think they

had them.

Woodberry showed superiority a’large part of the game,
but the Wildkittens had spirited determination through-
out. I believe if Davidson had the same team they had when
they ran against Riverside November 3rd, it would have
been a different story. The backfield was weakened when
fullback John Sherrill was held back with a knee injury,
and tailback Dave Neill was unable to dress for the game
due to a severe cold. The line also had to do without the
playing of Bob Strickland, right tackle, who was resting
up his knee for the coming game against Mars Hill.

Woodberry has one of the best little teams I’ve seen,
and-weltdeserves their present undefeated standing. —

In intra-murals the Betas seenied unwilling to be oiit-
dorie by the SPEs and came up from second place last
week to tie them for first place, and the championship.
During the many games played this year it has been quite
obvious that some of these intra-mural players have out-
standing football ability, and deserve credit for noteworthy
playing. Among the few is Jim Herdon who helped to
bring his team to the top with his spot passing. Another
outstander is John Wall who also is a splendid passer.
Not to be omitted are Joe Stukes:and Bill Kieth who to-

gether put the Betas up frent.

Did You Know?

Although basketball is the only
American born major sport, it was
played in 75 countries before the war,
and the record crowd to see a game is
23,000 at Peiping, China, in 1935.

Originally a put-out in baseball was
made by hitting the runner with a
throw ball before hé reached the base.

In 3840, four foot posts were used
for bases in baseball. Because of in-
juries, sand bags weré then used.
Since the baseman could push these
out of the way of a runner, a rule
was established making it mandatory
that bases be pegged down.

From 1921 through 1827 the Origi-
nal Celtics basketball team averaged
125 games a season, They carried only
one substitute and he seldom saw
service. Injuries meant nothing to

them,

Volleyball has taken Russia by
storm, It is practically the national
game of the Soviets. It is also a
favorite of our arthed forces.

Pro golfers are the lowest paid
professional athletes in the world.
They're paid exactly nothing; they

In 35-0 Victory

Sherrill, Richert, And Neill
Score Other Touchdowns

Paced by speedster Ward Lasley the
Davidson Freshmen thumped River-
side Military Academy 35-0 on a mud-
dy field at Gainsville, Georgia, Sat-
urday, November 3, in what observers
termed the best game the Wildkittens
have played all season. The cats struck
swiftly_and before five minutes had
elapsed held a fourteen point lead.
Their first tally came after end Bill
Johnson recovered a Riverside fumble
on his own forty-five yard line, On
the first play fulback John Sherrill
reeled off thirty-five yards to the
Cadets twenty-two, from where Lasley
dashed the remaining distance off tack-
le to score standing up. Herts Waldrop
kicked the extra. point from place-
ment, as he did four other times dur-
ing the afternoon to give him a per-
fect record for the day.

When they were tinable to gain
after the second kickoff, the Cadets
punted to the Davidson thirty-eight.
Here Lasley turned in the most spect-
acular run of the game as he circled
right end and raced sixty-two yards
down the sideline for the second score.

Shortly after the quarter the visi-
lors againt hit paydirt when quarter-

ek Joe Richert broke through cen-
ter for forty yards and another. touch-
down, Later in the period, with Lasley
Sherrill, and wingback Sterling Ed-
wards, alternating lugging the pig-
skin the kittens drove sixty-three yards
for a fourth score, Sherrill climaxed
the drive with™a four yard plunge
over center.

The Riversiders came back strength-
ened after the half and held the visi-
tors scoreless during the third frame.
Once the frosh seemed headed for a
touchdown when they drove deep into
the blue and gray territory, but two
consecutive fifteen yard penalties
forced them to kick. In the fourth
quarter, however, the Frosh were able
to push across another score after
Sherrill intercepted a Riverside pass
on his own forty. A pass from Neill,
substituted tailback, to end Bill Iver-
son, and runs by Sherrill and Neill,
took the ball to the two yard line, from
where Neill plunged over.

‘Riverside was one of the strongest
teams Davidson has faced, but, al-
though they fought to the end, they
could not stop the Wildkittens, who
were playing 100 per cent better ball
than in previous games. The Cadets
had a good running game and a-
massed six firstdowns, three less than
their opponents nine. Passes were few
because of the wet field. Riverside
completed three out of: nine aerials
for a total of thirty- seven yards, and
Davidson threw only three connecting
with one for seven yards, while in-
tercepting four. Fumbles were fewer
than might have been expected, with
the freshmen fumbling three times and
the Cadets twice, Davidson recovered
all fumbles. Bob Millar, Bob Strick-
land, Flash Morrison, and Joe Lean-
ord shone on defense for the Cats,

While Pittman, Gilbert, Curtis, and
McMillian were outstanding for River-
side.

Cats Crumble Riverside Play Mars Hill
In Season’s Best Game

Here Saturday

Lasley, Montgomery, Richert
And Sherrill Outstanding
A rather battered and crippled

Freshman team has been pulling it-

self together this week in preparation

for the Hamecoming clash with Mars

Hill College Saturday afternoon, in

what promises to be an interesting

game. Injuries and influenza wrecked
havoc among Wildkitten ranks last
week as they went down fighting be-
fore a powerful Woodberry

eleven, 18-0,

The Cats sorely missed the line play
of Bob Strickland and the passing of
Dave Neill, both of whom were on
the casualty list. Fullback John Sher-
rill, powerhouse of the Davidson of-
fense, was suffering from an ailing
ankle and could play only part time.
Nevertheless, he got off several nice
runs, once rolling, up two consecutive
first downs, Bitter cold, rainy weather
had three fourths of the team sick or
half sick. Despite these handicaps, the
fighting Wildkittens did not give up
and averted what might have been a
greater loss, Fumbles, caused by numb
fingers, hurt the Freshmens chances
considerably, and set up’ two of the
Woodberry touchdowns,

The Foresters first score came just
before the half when Murphy inter-
cepted a Davidson pass on his own
fifteen yard line. Led by Dean David-
son, their all-state fullback, the Orange
and Black mafched to the Freshman
four yard line, from where Davidson
stnashed over,

The- victors capitalized on two
fumbles recovered in Davidson ter-
ritory to score twice in the third
quarter. Peterson dashed through the
line’ for the first of these. The try for
extra point was again blocked. After
a tricky forward pass-lateral play had
carried to the Davidson four, Belew
fell across for the final score.

The Wildkittens only serious threat
came midway of the second period,
when they drove to the Woodberry
fifteen, only to bog down with a pass
interception:: Features of this drive
were the running of Sherrill and a
pass from Quarterback Joe Richert
to substitute Wingback, Bill Montgo-
mery, who turned in a good perform-
ance against his old Alma Mater.
