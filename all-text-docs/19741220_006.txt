Richmond built their lead.
from there, and when the Cats
tried to come back, it was too

late.

Greg Dunn led Davidson
with 21 points. Horowitz ended
with 19 points and 15 rebounds,
and Jay Powell added 13
points

Richmond’s key to success
was constant pressure and
shutting -off Davidson’s big
scorers of Powell, Dunn and
Horowitz. Powell came. into
the game shooting over 60 per-
cent but was only 5-19 in the
game.

Davidson then travelled to
Princeton to play the Tigers.
The Cats had never beaten
Princeton at Princeton, and
that was again to be the case
as the Tigers shut off David-

son’s scoring punch and
showed some of
win big, 72-56.

Princeton played an ex-
tremely tough man-to-man
defense with special em
on Dunn, Powell . and
Horowitz. This payed off as
Princeton held each player un-

ir own to

der his average.

Princeton took the lead mid- .

way through the first half and
never it. Early in
the second their lead was
as big as 21 points.’

Barnes Hauptfuher was the
main Cat killer as his 8-12 field
goal shooting and 88 free-
throw shooting gave him the
game scoring honors with 24.
His 812 shooting however
lowered his seasonal per-
centage which was 73 going in-
to the game, including making
his last 17 attempts.

Dunn led Davidson with 16
points while Powell had 14.
Horowitz was held to a mere
five points before fouling out.

‘evening. Three nights later,
the team bounced back with a

The Wildcats defeated the
Bears 42-15 last year.
Friday’s match was not as
one-sided.

Livingstone bolted to a
quick 30 lead, after Mike
Dosal lost 6-4. Brien Jacobs
continued his dominance over
the forfeit clan, as he

up his second forfeit in as

many matches. :

Glenn Ballard outfought his
oponent for an 84 victory,
making the score now David-
son 9, Livingstone 3.

his match, but thea came back
to destroy his opponent. Mark
Scandling won a 8-5 decision,
and Davidson was now on top

Ralph Holloway lost his

‘—match at 150. Bob Price was:

losing 9-6 when he pinned his
opponent. Price’s came from

Livingstene now sent their
studs onto the mat, and it
resulted in two _ pins.
Livingstone closed the gap to
21-18.

Jack Summe trudged onto
the mat knowing he had to win
to preserve the Davidson vic-
tory. Summe ‘dominated his

t. He was close tepin-
his man several times.

With Summes decision, the
win was preserved-for David-
son, much to the dislike of the
large Livingstone crowd.

have until Jan. 17 to prepare

for their next opponent
