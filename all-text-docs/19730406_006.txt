Police Search Dorm

Dean Tribble and accompanying police recently
raided a dorm at Emory University. According to
residents of the dorm, no individual rooms were sear-
ched, but the coke carton on which most of the dorm
had hidden its stash was discovered.

One source said that the dorm raid was a mistake
and added that the stimulus for the bust was another
dorm’s resident who grew three foot high marijuana
plants in his window sill. This report was reaffirmed
by a resident of the raided dorm who insisted that he

had seen the search warrant for a room in the other
dorm. He said that the officials aparently had

become confused, and the wrong men’s dormitory

was searched.

One of the residents of the busted dorm expressed
anger at Emory University for the action. ‘‘I per-

sonally think that it’s ridiculous that the school call

the police and start searching all around a men’s
dorm for just dope,’’ he said. ‘‘This is especially true
since at the beginning of the year they had told us that
we knew what would happen if they found dope, but
they wouldn’t go looking for it. Their attitude has
radically changed. We hope this won’t be a regular oc-

curence.”’

W & L Students Approve Coeducation
In a recent vote, Washington and Lee students over-
whelmingly approved coeducation for the university.
The vote was 799 students, or 59 percent, for
coeducation and 550 students, or 41 percent, against
coeducation. Student Body President Bob Brennan
noted that it was the heaviest turnout for any issue on
campus that he has seen. The 1349 students who voted
represent over 80 percent of the student body.

No action will be taken directly as a result of the
recent vote. The purpose of the vote was only to find
out student opinion regarding the coeducation issue.

Singer Bonnie Raitt Projects

Energy In Joplinesque Style

By JOE EARLE
Associate Editor

If you discovered Bonnie
Raitt) singing in a_ bar
somewhere, you might take her
for a barmaid trom a 17th Cen-
tury romance. She drinks
heavily, curses, talks brashly
and loudly and sings songs
about sex and pain.

Not one of those New York-
style glamour girls that jump
out of magazines or those aged
cheerleaders that show up
singing on TV, but a blues-folk
singer of the type seen only
rarely outside of seedy bars.
since the late forties or early fif-
ties.

Bonnie has all the tough ex-
terior of her bar-singing
predecessors, but the smooth
style and intelligence of a
professional. She has class.
Like Billie Holiday. Or Bessie
Smith. Or Janis Joplin.

In fact, Bonnie will probably
inherit the mantel Joplin left
when she died. She has all of
Joplin’s ability to project pain,
all her sensual appeal and all
her presence.

Bonnie also has an ability
Joplin never really realized:
the ability to put together a
good, lasting record. Bonnie has
put out two records in the last
two years, and both stand as
outstanding contributions to the
popular canon.

Joplin was always limited by
her bands and seemed unable to
establish herself in relationship
to her music.

Raitt has neither of those

problems. Instead. she has
carefully put her music
together. choosing

arrangements and sidemen that
can best compliment her songs
and style.

I had the good fortune to see
Bonnie perform a little over two
months ago at the National En-
tertainment Conference in Cin-
cinatti.

She was singing as part of a
show alt a party given for
delegates to that convention.
The party was held at a local
bar, and she was billed with the
Doobie Brothers and Martin
Mull.

The concert was a disaster for

her. The audience was three-
quarters drunk on the tree beer,
tired and totally unresponsive
She had sound problems. But
for all her bitchiness and
frustration, T telt that the show
proved what I had believed all
along. she was unique and had
style.

She came out onto the stage
shyly, and sitting up there with
only her basist Freebo to back
her up. she looked more
vulnerable than she had ever
appeared on record

But once she started to sing,
the unbelhevable beauty and
preciseness of her voice and
her fine guitar playing brought
back the Joplinesque tough girl.

Actually, her voice proved to
be her downtall at that show
The soundmen were evidently a
little too taken with it, and kept
turning down the guitar mikes.
She had been drinking a little
and was argumentative, and
finally apologetic about the
situation.

The situation quickly turned
off most of the students there.
They were all concert
promoters, and dismissed her

as an act tor their schools
because of her drinking and bit-
ching. I have never been so mad
al a crowd since the audience
walked out on Bette Midler last
year at Davidson.

Bonni's real problem was that
no one would listen to her. The
soundmen cooly ignored her
requests. (And they should have
listened, for her guitar work 1s
as fine as about anyone who is
making the rounds today, if not
better).

Sull, she pulled it off: With
class. She stayed on stage and
sang beautifully and kept her
cool. By the end of the show she
had a yood number of the
audience with her simply
because of her talent.

But more than that, she'll
make it because she has class.
She's as tough as she appears.
Yet inside her is the lady who
really does care, and she has
the ability to express that part
ot her through her music.

If you haven't heard Bonnie.
80 pick up a copy of “Give It
Up”. It’s a tine record by a per-
former who simply cannot be
denied her place in pop music.

Meat Boycott Week Indicates
Lack Of Community Spirit

To the Editor:

This week nas peen named
Meat Boycott Week by national
consumers groups. All across
the nation, hopefully
housewives and others are
trying to halt the rising price of
beef! by refusing to buy or eat
meat this week Cand by having
meatless Tuesdays and Thur-
sdays thereatter)_

What, vou may ask. has this
to do with Davidson College?
Everything. Davidson declares
self to be part of the
munity,
However

com-
hol an chilist’ society.
» When something as
Mportant as consumer altars
is confronted. there is little or
no response. [t Stmply is not as
eEXcHUng or as noticeable as
war protest

As a case in pont, T take the
Menu at Richards House The
Meat) Boveott has been well

publicized, yet there are no
meat-alternative meals served
(chicken, fish. macaroni, etc.)
One way to get students to sup-
port this boycott is to offer such
alternatives. Fraternities
should request that their cooks
slop serving meat. Members of
the faculty should observe the
boycott as an example to the
students.

OF course it as doubttul that
this boycott: will significantly
lower retail prices, but at least
will give consumers a chance
fo show their strength and
unity. The question remains
not whether the consumer
Movement will suceeed, but
Whether Davidson College will
pounrat
