We all agree on this . . . cigarette
Paper is important. For Chesterfield
we use the best paper that we can
buy. It is called Champagne Ciga-
rette Paper. It is made from the soft,
silky fibre of the flax plant. It is
washed over and over in clear, spark-
ling water.

A lot of the pleasure you get in
smoking Chesterfields is due to our
using the right kind of cigarette pa-
per. Chesterfield paper is pure, and
it burns without taste or odor.

Remember this . . . two things make the
smoking quality of a cigarette—the tobaccos and the
paper. The Champagne cigarette paper on Chester-
fields is tested over and over for purity, for the right
burning quality. Another reason why Chesterfield wins.
