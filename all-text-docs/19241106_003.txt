The Charge of the Bright Brigade
(With apologies to Hennyson and Co.)

Halt aetrig, half a trig,
Half a trig onward,
Into the valley of math
Strode the “green” hundred ;
Forward the bright: brigade

Into the valley of math

Forward the Bright brigade
Was there a man dismayed ?
even though the Freshie knew
Someone had blundered,
Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why.
Theirs but to bluff and try.
Into the valley of math
Strode the green hundred.

Prots to the right of them,
Profs to the left of them,
Profs in front of them
Hollered and thundered ;
Stormed at with x's and I's
Boldly they strode and well,
Into the jaws of math
Into the mouth of Hell
Strode the green hundred.

Flashed all their crayons bare,
| Flashed as they stood there,
Sab'ring the examples queer
Charging a calculus
While all the rest wondered ;
Then with a master stroke
Right through the proposition they broke
Square root and radius
Reeled from the crayon stroke
| Shattered and sundered.
Then they strode back, but not,
Not the same hundred.
