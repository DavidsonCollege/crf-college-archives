MACK W. LITTLE MEETS
DEATH BY ACCIDENT AS

RESULT OF

Gastonia Freshman Killed In
Watts Dormitory While

Cleaning Weapon
DEATH SHOCKS CAMPUS

Funeral Held Last Friday After-
noon In Gastonia

Tragedy cast a pall over the Davidson
campus for the second time this
when Mack Wilson Little, of the fresh-
man class, died here early Thursday at-
ternoon by an accidental shot from a
pistol held by Oren Moore, Jr.

Little, with three other freshmen, had
gone to Moore’s room on the fourth
floor of Watts Dormitory immediately
after lunch, and was engaged in cleaning
and looking at a .38 calibre automatic
pistol belonging to Moore. ‘The latter
states that he thought the weapon was
not loaded, as he had the cartridge mag-
azine in his pocket. The bullet struck
Little’s left side and went through his
heart. He died at 1:25 P. M., a few min-
utes after the accident occurred.

Authorities completely
Moore, a sophomore, and son of Dr.
Oren~*Moore, Davidson alumitus * and
prominent Charlotte physician.

Dr. W. L. Lingle, president of the col-
lege, stated that no disciplinafy action
was contemplated against Moore for po-
session of the pistol, but that a commit-
tee, had been appointed to investigate the
affair, He cited a college regulation for-
bidding students to keep firearms in their
rooms and added that a copy of this reg-
ulation is posted in every dormitory room.

A graduate of Gastonia high school,
Little was taking pre-medical work here
and was pledged to Pi Kappa Phi social
fraternity. He is survived by his father
who is a Gastonia merchant, his mother,
who is a school teacher, and a younger
sister.

The funeral services were held in the
First Associate Reformed Presbyterian
Church of Gastonia at four o'clock I'ri-
day afternoon, November 22, with Rev.
Dr. Ernest N. Orr, pastor of the Asso
ciated Reformed Presbyterian Tabernack
of Charlotte, officiating and Dr. Walter

sisting. The  pall-bearers Mack

Barium Springs,. “Davidson's _ little
brother,” will observe its homecoming on
November 30, next Saturday. The fea-
ture of the occasion will be. the football
game Saturday afternoon at 3:00, when
the Barium eleven will tangle with
Coach Rosie M6Millan’s Lumberton team.

Special interest will mark the conflict
because of the fact that McMillan was
formerly coach of the Barium gridders.
The Barium team averages less than 140
pounds, and has been out-weighed by its
opponents in every game of the season
by not less than fifteen pounds.

At 11 o'clock the Barium Springs Glee
Club will present a program in the chapel,
and at 12:15 the alumni banquet will be
held, followed by a business discussion
This discussion will be under the direc-
tion of Mr. R. E. Jackson, President of
the Alumni Association, and Miss Hilda
Bernado, is secretary.

An idea of thé importance of this in-
stitution to Davidson College can be
gotten from a consideration of the fact
that no Wildcat team since 1928 has
failed to include a representative from
Barium Springs. Officials at the game on.

Fluorescent Minerals
Displayed In Museum

A display of fluorescence is the most
novel and yet one of the most interesting
things in the college museum, located on
the second floor of the north wing of
Chambers.

Fluorescence is a peculiar property of
certain minerals by which they shine in
ultra-violet light.

A cabinet containing eighteen kinds of
minerals which have been collected from
various states on the Atlantic seaboard,
Sicily, England, and Canada, is lighted
with ordinary electric lamps and also with
argon bulbs which produce ultra-violet
light. The ordinary lamps allow one to
see the ordinary appearance of the min-
erals, while the argon bulbs show their
iluorescence.

The mineral in which a color change is
most noticeable is wernerite, which came
from Quebec, Canada. Under
light this mineral appears to be a pale
green rock with a few gray spots. Under
the violet light the green turns to a
canary yellow and the gray to a rich pur-
ple.

Amendment Is Discussed By
President: Of Student Body

Change Is Intended To Cut Down
On Unnecessary And
Disturbing Noises

What effect will the proposed amend-
ment to the constitution of the Student
Tiody" have on me? This is a question
which is being asked on the campus every
day. We have called on C. B. Chapman,
President of the Student Body, to explain
the purpose and history of, and the re-
sults that may be expected from the
proposed constitutional amendment.

“The purpose of the amendment is not
to be carried to unreasonable lengths. It
is not intended to cut down on talking
and the other necessary noises of cam-
pus life; but it is the object of the plan
to eliminate noises which not only dis-
turb many students, but which also dis-
turb people in the surrounding
munity.

“The sole purpose of the amendment
is the reasonable control of noise. It will
cause very little, if any changes far

com-

as
as the average student is concerned.

“One of the chief aims of the present
student Government since its inaugtra-
tion has been the elimination of unnec-
essary noises during study hours. The
proposed amendment was worked out af-
ter
unanimously by the Student Council at
the regular meeting of November 11. The
amendment was presented in the last is-
sue of the and in
chapel the next day, Following the pro-
cedure authorized in the cgnstitution of

much discussion and was approved

Davidsonian read

the Student Body, the amendment is be

ing allowed to “lie on the table” for ten
days after being read; it will then |

voted on by the Student Body.
\

“This plan was worked out by stu
dents alone and‘ directly for the benefit
of the Student—Bedy—as a whole. The
responsibility for executing the plan

rests solely on the Student Council and
not on the representatives-to be appointed
on each hall. Representatives will be ap
pointed purely for the convenience of thi
members of each..hall,..and itis. to be
emphasized that the function of thesc
representatives is certainly not that of a
watchman or monitor. They will merely
receive complaints and refer them to’ the
Student Council.

“The council is not proposing a new
idea; similar systems are being used in
some of the most advanced universities
of our time.

“A man desiring to render a complaint
will take his complaint to his hall repre
sentative, who in turn will refer thé
complaint to the Student Council Com-
mittee. This Committee will be composed
of three members of the Student Coun-
cil; and it will be the duty of this group
to investigate complaints.

“Tf it finds the complaints well founded,
it will request the offender to be more
considerate in his actions. Second
plaints against the same offender will re-
sult in a Student Council investigation.
Only in extreme cases will the Council
see fit to remove a student from the dor-
mitories, It is the hope ‘and expectation
