Davidson Musical Organization
To Give Concert Here This
Month

The Davidson College Orchestra and
Glee Club are planning a combined con-
cert to begin here the second week in
May. These concerts will be identical
to those presented by these organi-
zation on tours in Virginia.

As yet these combined groups have
not offered a complete recital here. The
Glee Club and Orchestra have received
many requests from outsiders to com-
bine their programs. There will be no
charge for these concerts, but free will
offerings will be accepted for the pur-
pose of obtaining keys for the individual

. members.

The Glee Club is presenting a pro-
gram of a secular type at 3:30 on the
afternoon of May 19th. This program
will be presented at the Second Pres-
byterian Church in Charlotte, under
the auspices of the Charlotte Christian
Endeavor. =

Professor Pfohl acted as one of the
Judges at the State High School Musical

uable tham any team Davidson could
ever “buy”.

Capt. Pritchett has been chosen by
the authorities of the Univiersity of
Virginia to head the reorganization of
the Universitie’s athletic system. He
states that it has been very definitely
and positively decided that Virginia
will not “turn pro”. Capt. Pritchett
states that his aim as director of ath-
letics will be to discover and awaken
potential athletic ability among the
students. He hopes to establish an
interamural sports plan similar to Dav-
idson’s.

Capt. Pritchett and his family will
move to Charlottesville where their
new home will be, early in the summer.

Capt. Pritchett payed Davidson the
tribute of saying that when the David-
son—Virginia football game come off
next fall that he was ready to tell any-
one that he'd be there pulling for the
Wildcats.

Dr. Ruark Lectures Here

(Continued from Page 1, Col. 2)

He collaborated with Dr. H. C. Urey,
Nobel prize winner and professor at
Columbia University, in the compilation
of “Atoms, Molecules, and Quanta,” a
book which records every important
contribution to the fields of Physics
and chemistry made within the last
ten years.

This book is a standard text, used in
almost every institution of higher learn-
ing within the land and has become the
sine pua non for candidates for an ad-
vanced degree in either of these sub-
jects.

A comparatively young man, in the
middle forties, Dr. Ruark has: for a
decade been affiliated with the leading
scientific organizations of the country.
At present he is engaged in forming
southern branches of the Physical So-
ciety of America.

He spoke at the meeting of the Sou-
thern Association of Physicists recently
held at Decatur. He also delivered
several papers to the Academy of
Sciences meeting held in Greensboro
last week and attended by Prof. Fulcher
of the Davidson Physics Department

Student Loan Fund. Many students
have received money from this fund
which enabled them to stay in school
when otherwise they would have been
forced to withdraw.

For the last few years no great pro-
fit has been made from the store, but
the present year shows an apprecible
gain.

(Continued from Page 1, Col. 6)

Capt. Pritchett has also studied at
Harvard and University of Wisconsin
a member of the Alpha Tau Omega
fraternity. Later while at Davidson
he was elected to Omnicrom Delta
Kappa.

In honor and recognition of the work
of Capt. Pritchett, the’ Yearbook of
1933 was dedicated»to him with the
following words “The class of 1933 re-
spectfully dedicates this volume of the
Quips and Cranks to its best friend,
example and counselor, to him who is
the personification of all that is and
should be the Davidson Spirit, Cap-
tain Norton Goodier Pritchett.

In leaving Davidson, Cap. Pritchett
makes the following statement. “The
seven years we have lived in Davidson
have meant more to us than we can
hope to express in words”.

Capt. Pritchett comments very high-
ly upon athletics at Davidson College,
its school spirit, its square playing and
the spirit of cooperation of it athletics.
He says that there is no possibility of
Davidson “turning pro”, because our
reputation as a school that Plays its
own regular students is far more val-.

Substitutions: Davidson: Ganier for
Baskerville in the 7th, Calloway for
Kieswetter in the middle of the 4th.

Davidson got 6 hits against 18, had
five left on bases against none, stole 1
base against 5, and made 10 errors
against 5.

The game with Wingate Junior
College was played Saturday, in Win-
gate. The Davidson line-up was the
same as that of Firday, except that
Rogers played in Center field, Clard
pitched, Goodman played in right field,
and Ganier, G., played at third through-
out the game. Wingate scored in the
second, third, fourth, sixth, and seventh
innigs, for a toal of seven runs, thir-
teen hits, and three errors. The Frosh
scored in the sixth and ninth innings,
for a total of four runs, nine hits, and
one error. There were no substitutes.

Former College Head
Talks Over Old Times

(Continued from Page 3, Col. 1)

“Would you mind telling about some
of your honors while in college?”

“Not at all. “At Davidson I won
gold medals in Greek, Mathematics,
and English. “At Virginia, also two
gold medals in oratory. Phi Beta
Kappa and ODK at Washington and
Lee, besides Kappa Phi in Journalism”.

“Could you relate an experience of
yours while in college?”

“Yes as a student at Davidson, I
organized a skating club and decided
to build a pond for skating. Together
with some other boys, we built a dirt
dam and waited for freezing weather.
One ‘night “about 10 O'clock I went
down to see if the ice would hold. It
éidn’t and that’sall the exploit amounted
to. Later, a lake was built.

“Dr. Smith, I’ve often heard the
statement that you played a large part
in the World War without firing a
shot?”

“Yes, I was the agency through
which the government stirred the Ger-
man people to a state of rebellion, and
thus ended the war by several month.”

Note: The National Security league
offered a reward for the best plan to
distribute Allied propaganda over Ger-
many and Dr. Smith, having an in-
timate knowledge of air-currents offered
a plan which later resulted in millions
of tiny balloons floating over and de-
scending upon Germany with prop-
aganda pamplets attached to them.

So successful was the plan, that the
German officers offered rewards for
every balloon turned in, but of course
that did not prevent a reading of the
Dr. Smith was awarded and
commended by the government for his
plan.

messages.

“Dr. do you think there is any harm
in dancing at Davidson?”

“A dance at Davidson under super-
vision of professors and with no liquor
being drank by the students, is much to
be preferred to a college dance in Char-
lotte without such supervision and
Teetotalism.

In closing, Dr. Smith added that it
might he interesting to note, that in the
scientific field, he was the first scientist
in the United States to use Roentgen's
newly discovered X-Ray in medical and
surgical cases. Also the second x-ray
picture ever to be made in the U. S.
was made here at Davidson.

Davidson Produces
Honest Statesman

Judge A. L. Gaston, of Chester, S. C.,
judge of the sixth circuit and a David-
son Alumnus has aroused a great deal
of comment over his recent action in
regard to back pay.

It seems that some time ago certain
members of the legislature sponsored
a movement for the reduction of sal-
aries of state officials. Judge Gaston
says, he was “a party to it”. However
the Supreme court later ruled that the
officials should receive~their regular
salary, whereupon Judge Gaston was
sent a check for $2,705 for back pay.
Camptroller General A. J. Beattie dis-
closed the fact the other day that the
Judge had retured the check saying he
was a member of the group favoring
the reduction. Judge Gaston even went
so far as to guarantee the state that in
returing the money he relinquished any
futher claim to it on the part of his
heirs or estate.

We are tempted to say that David-
son even produces honest or conscien-
tious policy least, politician, and gov-
ernment officials” Something to be
proud of in this modern age.
