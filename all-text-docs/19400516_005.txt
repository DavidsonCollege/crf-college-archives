group of seniors close their college
careers. With a glance backward
over the past years here, “What
feature (or part) of Davidson do
you value most?”

Jimmie Cooper:

I like the small student body of |

Davidson better than any of its
other features. Here with a limited
number of high class (comparative-
ly) students and a large number of
activities and organizations, every
student has a golden opportunity
to come into intimate contact with
his fellow students under all sorts
of conditions and circumstances, to
learn “to know men for what they
really are”, to take part in every
part‘of campus life; to develop his
abilities and capabilties; and to as-
sociaté with such fine teachers as
Professor E, A, Beaty. Thus every
student can spend four years here
that will help him to become a bet-
ter man.

Jack Abernathy:

To me the best feature of David-
son is the opportunities it offers in
comparison with larger schools. Op-
portunities, particularly in the extra-
curricular fields of endeavor, are
open to every member of the stu-
dent body, talented or not. Espe-
cially for those not already blessed
with the ability and experience in
leadership so necessary in later life,
are there manifest chances to get
into something, to get that soul-
satisfying feeling of power, reward,
and honor, which should equip him
to rise to greater heights of serv-
ice. The opportunity is certainly
present at Davidson, the will to use
it lies with the individual.

George Milne:

A lovely day in May with warm
breezes tickling the sensitive leaves,
just about five o’clock—the ap-
pealing choices of useful sleep or
the futile attempt to knock a white
pellet around the exhausting golf
course—cool showers ‘that wash off
the earthy smells of \perspiration—
the quiet ofa Sunday vespers—the
familiarity of the executive com-
mittee with one’s private life—the
charm of a certain English profes-
sor’s lecture on Byron—these things
and ever so mafiy more I like about
Davidson—where else would one
find them?

Poss McLean:

I like the boys the best. I think
they are the highest type and best
all-around fellows of any school I
know of. By being a small school
you can come to know boys more
intimately and you have a better
chance to make life-long friends
than you ordinarily would. David-
son has the advantage of more in-
timate association with professors
and a chance for the boys to de-
velop their athletic abilties to a
great extent by individual atten-
tion from the coaches. I think that
the good name of Davidson and
the good will associated with it
will prove of great benefit to us in
later life.

Plans were also discussed for

I admire the confident manner in

“God in Education,” by M. L
Jacks, is directed to tell us that
no educational system can endure
except in so far as it is rooted

and grounded in God, and that from
those roots and that fertile soil it
must draw such vitality as" it’ pos-

Another book in connection with
religion “The Gospel of the
Kingdom,” by Frederick C, Grant.
In the book the author views the
movement of primitive Christianity
against its political, economic and
religious background. This view of
the gospel tradition ds taken in the
light of its earliest Jewish environ-
ment rather than in that of later
ecclesiastical interpretation. The re-
sult reveals a picture of Jesus as
and teacher, one who
lived so close to God that His re-
ligious views were uttered with di-
authority. From this picture
grows the concept that Christians
must live by faith—faith in the kind
of life that Jesus lived and taught.
Christianity a system; it is
a life, a conviction and a faith.
