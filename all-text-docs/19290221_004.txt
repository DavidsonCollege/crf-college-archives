SUCCESSFUL TRIP
MADE BY ‘Y’ GROUP

Seven Students Take Charge of
All Sunday Services in Hickory
Church

On Sunday, February 10, one of the
most successful “Y” deputations that
was ever sent from Davidson College
held church services at the First Pres-
byterian Church of Hickory, N. C.
This deputation consisted of seven Da-
vidson men including the following:
C. H. Mauzy, Jr., Aubrey Brown, Z. V.
Long, Charlie Pratt, Bill Archie; Paul
Fry, and C. C. Orr. These men were
given complete charge of the church
services for the day.

The deputation left Davidson Satur-
day and were very cordially received at
a social given especially in their honor
the same night. At Sunday* School on
the following morning, classes were
taught by the Davidson men, talks
were made before the congregation
when they had assembled after classes,
and special music was played. In the
morning service, Z. V.:Long and Au-
brey Brown spoke. Two solos,-a vocal
and a violin, were rendered by Bill
Archie and C. C. Orr, respectively.

In the afternoon, the classes of Sun-
day School Missions were taught by
the Davidson men. The Christian En-
deavor or Young People’s meeting at
night was turned over to Charlie Pratt
and Paul Fry, who made interesting
talks and led the entire meeting.

On Monday morning the whole
deputation went to the Hickory High
School and conducted chapel services
before the entire student body. Zeb
Long led in prayer while C. C. Orr
and Bill Archie played and sang some
special musical selections. The speak-
er of the morning was C, H. Mauzy, Jr.

In the fifth contest of their northern
invasion the Davidson Wildcats were
defeated by the University of Vir-

Having won two games and lost an|
equal number the Wildcats opened the
game with a rush and a determination
to win. Calhoun sank a basket in the
first two minutes of play to start the
scoring. Virginia quickly took the
lead, however, and held it throughout
‘the remainder of the contest despite

Generals Swamp Visitors in
Largest Davidson Defeat—
55-26

In a hard fought contest, February
14, the Washington and Lee Generals
ran wild to defeat the Davidson Col-
lege Wildcats, 55 to 26.

This came as the second and most
disastrous defeat that the “Cats” ex-
perienced on their Northern invasion.
The game which was played in Lex-
ington, Virginia, was the fourth of a
series of six games—three of which the
Wildcats won and three of which went
to their opponents.

At one time early in the game the
Wildcats were on even terms with the
Generals and at the end of the first
period the score was 10-10. But the
half finished with the Generals on the
front end of a 22-1: count and from
then on they were never headed.

Lowry, Cox and Williams led the
scoring for the Virginians, tallying, re-
sectively, 22, 14 and 12 points; while
Rusk, Calhoun and _ Pritchett

were

The Wildcats fought gamely through-
out the contest but their guarding and
teamwork could not withstand the
victorious onslaught of the Generals.

Louisville Seminary Professor
Counsels Future Theologians

| Dr. Andrew K. Rule, of the Louis-
ville Theological Seminary, gave to the
members of the Ministerial Band Sun-
day afternoon a very broad and com-
prehensive counsel in regard to the re-
quirements for the acceptance of the
ministerial challenge.

The first point which he brought out
was the importance of a prospective
minister's guarding ‘his health. He
said that it was well for a man to excell
in some particular sport. Speaking from
his experiences he stated that physical
fitness was very helpful to a minister.
He “stressed spiritual communion
with God, and the importance of being
able to pray. A minister must be con-

secrated entirely to the service of
God.
Dr. Rule compared the modern

ecclesiastical regime with that of a few
years ago, and said that a modern min
ister must well informed in
