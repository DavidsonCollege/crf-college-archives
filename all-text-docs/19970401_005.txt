English Department Announces
Fall ’97 Colloquium Topic:
The Disembowelment of Text

By MOoLLy FLANDERS

The theme for next year’s En-.
glish Colloquium is “The Disem-
bowelment of Text.” This theme
was decided upon in an effort to
maintain a sense of continuity with
this year’s colloquium, “The Em-
bodiment of Text,” said Professor
of English Toné Touchyfeely.

“This year’s theme was so
widely-received and enjoyed by the
seniors that the department decided
we had to continue it, I mean we
really beefed it up” Touchyfeely
stated.

“We traveled so far inembody-
ing the text—I mean we really were
at the meat of things—that it seemed
appropriate to follow the trend of lit
crit and deconstruct, devour, and
regurgitate the our bodies. The
subtitle for Colloquium will be: How .
to Take Your Text and Eat It Too, or
Digestion and Denouement, or Vir-
gins and Vivisections. I’m just not

sure. ”

“We hope,” Prophet of English
gaglibson declared as I passed her
flowing down the hall, “We hope
that the body—the guts, the gonads,
the goiter—all, through the pas-
sionate and provocative explora-
tion corpuscles and lipids, reveals
the hot juicy substance inside us all
that makes us blubber like whales,
scream like hyenas, and coo like
doves. It will be blood and gore;
sex and violence. The best and
worst. What English major
wouldn’t love it? I tell you. Truly,
what English major wouldn’t love
it? Cry for it! Disembowel me,

they’llsay. They’ll beg.” Downthe °

hall she walked on, glowing, laugh-
ing—her enthusiasm bubbling like
soda pop.

Junior English majors, when
interviewed by Davidphonian staff
members, responded positively to

., the prospects of a gut-wrenching

semester: ““Yeah, sure. Cool. Damn.
Oh, oh, I can’t wait. Fuck me,”

were a few of the responses. One
student, who wishes to remain
anonomoose, said, “Disembowel-
ment. Neat. I’m thinking of chang-
ing my major just to join collo-

quium.”

drunk.”

The student who received the
most charges is senior Mordecai
Stolk, who was arrested on a total of
‘684 counts of crimes against nature
and fornication. Stolk says, “Six
hundred eighty-four? What the
hell’s that? I mean, are they trying
to insult me or something? I’ ve got-
ten around plenty more than that, I
can guarantee you.”

After a moment, he continues,
“Well, I guess they weren’t count-
ing any of the prospectives.”

Referring to an inflatible sheep
that he shares with his roommates,
Stolk says, “Oh yeah, that they
charged me for that too. So one of
my counts was with the Erotic Love
Ewe, for Chrissake. Man, so they’re
saying I’ve only been to bed with
six hundred eighty-three girls here.
That’s ridiculous. Plus, can you
believe a rimjob is a crime against
nature?”

A senior who asked to remain
anonymous and only be identified
as a fuzzy fruit denies all of the c
arges againsther. “Please,” she says-
, “everybody who knows me wil

tell you that I’m chaste. I’m
aving myself for marriage, and any
one of the dozens of guys I’ve re-
jected can confirm it.” SBI agents
could find no men to corroborate
her claims.

School health educator Geor-
gia Ringle says, “The entire affair is
a travesty. Here we have young
people just trying to express their
sexuality, and the cops have to bu
tin and hurt plenty of innocent youn
women and men. It makes me sick

ow the Man always tries to pu-
sh us down. The fight will always c
ntinue. Power to the people.” Shes
ys, “Those cops really must need a g
od lay, just like most of the students
