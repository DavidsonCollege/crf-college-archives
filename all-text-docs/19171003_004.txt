The indications are that the Orchestra
and Glee Club are embarking upon a
most successful year. A new system of
organization has heen inangurated which
consists of a president, Jibrarian and
executive committee. The executive
committee consists of the manrger, as-
sistant manager, leader of the Glee Club,
director of the -Orchestra, and the
librarian. This committee has entire
charge of the plans and finances of the
organization. The books are open at all
times and the managers make monthly
reports to this committee.

At a-meeting last week, J. L: Fowle
was elected manager and leader of the
Glee Club; E. P. Childs, director of the
Orchestra, and D. R. Freeman elected
librarian.

A special invitation is extended to the
new men who have any ‘vocal or instru-
mental talent to come out to the next
meeting of these organizations, which
will be announced in chapel.

Manager Childs, when
about the organization of a
Band, said that all efforts in this di-
rection have failed so far. However.
another attempt will be made the last
of the week, and it is hoped that. more
of the new men will respond. Every
man who has ever plaved an instrument
of any sort is urged to try out for the
band. Tf you haven't. an ‘instrument of
your own it may be possible to supply
you with one. Come and see what those
in charge can do for you. An announce-
ment of this meeting will be made in
chapel soon, so watch for it.

LOCAL RED CROSS

Rates: $1.00 and Up

j. P. SAUNDERS, President

Following its organization last spring
the local branch of the American Red
Cross Association has been very active.
The concrete results of the summer’s
work show that approximately twelve
hundred dollars has been contributed by
them to the National Million Dollar
Campaign which was waged during the
summer. At its organization nearly one
hundred dollars was raised in member-
ship fees and the above amount has
been secured in addition. The ladies of
the organization are energetic in pre-
paring supplies to be sent to the soldier
in our armies and a work room is kept
open by them for this purpose. David-
son has an active branch.
