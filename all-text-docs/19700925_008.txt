Group Organizes
For Blue Election

If junior Whit Ayres and
the local chapter of the Move-
ment for a New Congress
have their way, ‘Cliff Blue
will be representating North
Carolina’s Eighth Congres-
sional District come January.

Blue has been selected by
the chapter as the candidaté
that they will give help to
in the organization’s bid to
create a congress which is
willing to ‘“‘reorder priorities
from military spending to do-
mestic uses,” according to
Ayres.

The organizational meeting
of the chapter will be held
Tuesday -at 9:30 in the Mor-
rison Room. Ayres indicated
that the “initial response has
been very favorable.”

Ayres characterized the

fall as ‘‘an attempt to or-

the candidates who are will-
ing to vote to reorder the na-
tional priorities.

“We're at a disadvantage
in that we won’t have a pic-
ture candidate like an Allard
Lowenstein or a Teddy Ken-
nedy,

“Blue was selected as a
moderate running against a
very conservative incumbent
and a candidate, involved in
a close race in which we
think we can be very help-
ful.”

Ayres added, ‘‘Blue was
surprisingly encouraging. I
had expected him to be hesi-
tant. The race is close and
he has a definite chance to
win.”

idea that the presence of
students in Blue’s campaign
would be ill received by the
voters.

“If handled in a tactful
manner, I think our work
will be very beneficial. We’re
going to try to get out the
friendly vote that might not
have gone to the polls.’

he has been invited to parti-
cipate in a cultural exchange
program to evaluate Ameri-

eral German Universities.

He will visit, among other
places, the University of Ber-
lin, Konsanz, Bauchoun and
Marbourg, where several Da-
vidson students are current-
ly studying.

that the average student is
apathetic on issues. For ex-
ample, it seems to me they
are concerned with what in-
volves them personally, like
the refrigerator problem.
Maybe I’m wrong, though.

MISS. ROSS: I think that
may be a little unfair. As
far as adaemics go, I think
the students are really en-
thusiastic’ about getting their
work done.

MISS DANIELS: I think
that they feel more of a pur-
pose in studying then stu-
dents at girls’ schools. There’s
no purpose in academics at
a girls’ school, or at least at
mine, -

You go to classes and learn
but you really don’t feel like
you have a purpose for learn-
ing. Here I feel like students
really have a purpose.

MISS ROSS: I’ve seen so
many people here go to work
in things like Open House
and birth control and Plan-
ned Parenthood. | think those
I’ve seen of the students here
are very involved.

MISS YOUNG: Just  be-
cause they aren’t interested
in inner-city work doesn’t
mean they are apathetic,
either. They might be inten-
sely interested in history or
something, and that’s just as
worthwhile.

MISS LOWRANCE: I think
that the boys here have a
much greater awareness of
self than those at other
schools. They are much more

aware and _ interested in
what’s going on in_ their
minds.

DAVIDSONIAN: Since Da-
vidsonian students have been
far. removed’ from many
things, particularly females,
could you give your responses
to the popular feminist move-
ment. Do you feel that there
is a feminine perspective?

MISS DANIEL: To What?

DAVIDSONIAN: A major
_argument for coeducation
“is that women do have a dif-
ferent perspective to add to
the classroom. It this true?

MISS YOUNG: I think that

MISS LOWRANCE: I think
it all depends on the person.

DAVIDSONIAN: The’ ma-
jor worry about going co-ed
among many male students
is that possibly the educa-
tional standards will drop,
not so much because the
girls will lower it, but be-
cause they might , distract
the boys. How do you feel
about this?

MISS DANIEL: Well, you
know héW much time the
students spend in Charlotte
at Queens now. I really think
that's one of the least of
their worries.

MISS ROSS: And they will
have more time to work on
week-ends. You get a date

Miss Luster ‘Sleepwrites’

LSD-Fed Symbolic Erotica

By DICK ANDERSON
Associate Editor

What is creativity. Is it
something a writer must
dredge’ out of himself, or

does it come unbidden, trans-
mitting a message for which
the writer’s mind is only a
channel?

This question is especially
relevant to Miss~Helen Lus-

ter, the poet--she disdains
the-—name—_“*“‘poetess”’--who
Tread in the College Union

Bar Wednesday night as the
year’s first poetry circuit
performer.

Miss Luster told students
and faculty who met with
her at lunch and dinner that
at least her most recent
work has largely created it-
self while she sleeps at
night. ‘

“IT get up in the morning
and write it down,” she said.
“Some of my best poems I
didn’tLeven change a word
in.

‘‘My earlier works is just
observation of the world
around me,” she explained.
“The problem was I didn’t
have any output. I had tech-
nique but no output.”

Miss Luster said her first
book had required ten years
of writing, but that she had
suddenly become more crea-
tive, writing six more books
in a year and a half by
means of her “‘sleepwriting.””

“Tt’s really much better
work than I did-before,” she
said, ‘‘and therefore more
satisfying, although I can’t
feel any ego trip any more.
I feel I have become a ve-
hicle of some sort.”

She dates the beginning of
her ‘increased creativity to
LSD experience she under-
went atia party. when some-
one slipped *the drug in her
drink. |. | :

“T’m* fot: -recornmending
LSD for anybody,” she warn-

ed, ‘‘although I feel there
should be centers with medi-
cal superivision and all, for
the people who need it, the
drug is terribly dangerous

“I definitely don’t think it
should be used for kicks,”
she continued, ‘but it can
open up experience for you
if the experience of the drug
is oriented in the direction
you are going.

“Spiriutal drugs are for a-
purpose. In societies that
have used them. regularly,
like Indians taking peyote,
they have traditionally been
tied up with life. But in this

- Society we don’t have ,any

Spiritual orientation.”

Miss Luster feels that her
drug experience enabled her
to experience and become a
vehicle for the pulse of the
universe. 5S

“It is a tuning in to the
universe, which is a rhythmic
thing. If you’re in an emotion-
al state, you’re in a rhythmic
state,” she said. *‘Human
speech under great emotion
falls into rhythmic patterns:
the problem is not to lose
the energy of that rhythm.

“In prose there is a great
loss of energy. In great poe-
try you keep the energy, find
if by your poetry you can get
someone in this emotional
state then you have written
a great poem.”

Miss Luster’s poetry tends

to be highly themati¢ with
frequent reiteration of sym-
bols, and also often ex-
tremely erotic.

“When I began writing I
suddenly began to identify
myself with the female force
in nature,” Miss Luster ex-
plained. ‘I-had this thing
about monotheism; I felt it
was wrong. Jehovah is pure-
ly. masculine, but in nature
there is masculine and fe-
male, and divinity should re-
flect this.”

|

Miss Luster admits that
her symbology can be fairly
complex — ‘‘somebody once
accused me of making puz-

zles in my poems for the
hearer; he announced me by
saying: ‘I want to warn you

that it’s going to be terribly
difficult?” — but feels that
the reader must do some of
the work.

But the artist
think of himself
above his audience,” she
added. ‘The relationship has
to be reciprocal.”

Spencer said he will also
stop over for a week in Eng-
land fo confer with univer-
sity officials there.

Spencer said he thought
some developments in Ger-
man higher education might
be worth putting into effect
in the United States.

He noted that most gradu-
ate level programs in U. S
universities are patterened
after European models.

Spencer noted that German
universities aré operated dif-
ferently from most American
schools.

There are no private col-
leges in Germany. All uni-
versities are state universi-
ties, and there is a national
admissions system. Any stu-
dent who passes national high
school exams is admitted to
any university he wants to
attend, regardless of his
financial condition.

Spencer and his family
lived in Germany from 1965
to 1966 when he was a Ful-
bright Lecturer in American
history at the University of
Munich.

While Spencer is in Ger-

favorite duty as dean and

The search a brought to
Davidson a program of ex-

details yet to be worked
out.

Another proposal is pre-
sently before the Educational
Policy Committee. It con-
cerns self scheduled exami-

a proposal, but Ostwalt ex-
pects action on the passage
of this proposal by the fac-
ulty. Both of these programs
will benefit the students by
providing new options in the
curriculum,

Ostwalt’s extracurricular
activities have been made
possible by the addition of
compiters at Davidson. He
said’ the computers relieved
him of much paper work
and gave him more time
to deal with student’s prob-
lems,

The computer so far hasn’t
done the job everyone ex-
pected. This’is because we
are in a ‘‘transition from an
old to a new system,” he
said,

A new computer was in-
Stalled here at Davidson in
August of this year. It is
a NCR Century 100 and re-
places the less modern IBM
1620 computer system.

The new computer handles
more sophisticated jobs. In
the future the registrar’s of-
fice will be relieved of even
more work.

He plans to program the

/ computer for academic prior-

ities; causing the computer
to schedule academic educa-
tion or ROTC.

This will be an advantage,
because these two courses
are easier to reschedule, he
said.

Ostwalt is not sure when
the computer would be work-
ing to its fuii capacity but
predicted that it would be
operable by the end of this
year. The Century 100 usual-
ly takes six to nine: months
to become adjusted.

Ostwalt became registrar
on this campus three years
ago ‘‘to help work on the
implementation of the new
curriculum.” This set the
tone of his work-thus. far at
Davidson. :

Politics holds a real in-
terest for Ostwalt. He is a
Democrat. He votes the
straight Democratic ticket.
“Any Democrat is_ better
than any Rebublican.’”, Be-
yond that he has ‘‘an open
mind.”
