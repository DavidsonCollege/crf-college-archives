Davidson Unveils New
Environmental Stance

By Irwin Lipschitz
Doing his part to celebrate
Earth Day, Bob Collins, Physical
Plant Director decided to instate
Davidson’s new cnvironmental
policy.

The first stcp ina three point plan
was to cut down the 5,000 ycar old
holly bushes in frontof Belk dorm.

Next, Collins plans to remove all
the trees on campus. They will be
replaced by clegant marble pedes-
tals with brass plaques in remem-
brance of the trecs.

“Iv ll be great,” said Collins. “We
can keep the arborctum without
actually having to take care of the
trees.”

The third step in the new envi-
ronmental policy will be to pave
the entire campus. The concrete,
of course, will be painted green to

preserve the look and fecl of na-
ture.

The policy is one ina scrics of
new cost-cutting measures the
College plans to pursuc in order to
bring the students the most for
their cducation dollar.

When asked if cutting down trces
wasn’t a rather ironic and cynical
way to celebrate Earth Day, ascn-
ior administrator stated, “Earth
Day, Schmerth Day. We have to
look out for number onc, and
Davidson is definitely number
one.”

An anonymous tip suggesicd that
President Bush plans to make
Davidson the environmental col-
lege.

In an cmo-

urged his
Davidsonians to
be unccasing in
their use of “the
mother tonguc”
(or “the moth-
erf------ tongue” he thoughtfully
suggested for Davidson’s black stu-
dents and alumni). “What is the
mother tongue,” you ask? As Price
explained it, the “mother tonguc”
is simply the pure Protestant Pres-
bysterian lexicon native to the ma-
jority of traditional Davidson stu-
dents. One student commented,
“As one who appreciates a good

Martin To Be Davidson President

By James Brown and Ollie
North

The Davidsonian has learned
that should Jim Holderman be
unable to fulfill his dutics as Presi-
dent of Davidson College, North
Carolina Governor Jim Martin, a
Davidson alum, would become the
acting President.

Contacted at his spring home
in Haiti, Gov. Martin said, “I hope
I can come to Davidson and har-
ness the dangcrous libcral move-
ment that is beginning to surface
on campus.” The Governor also
revealed that his first act as Presi-
dent would be to “fire that damn

cynical Davidsonian editor and
clear the paper of those peace-
loving flower children., After all,
everyone knows the current
Davidsonian misrepresents
Davidson.”

Also on Martin’s agenda, “I
plan on turning Baker Sports
Complex into a profit machine.
Currently, students get to use the
facility for nothing more than tui-
tion. I’m going to turn that baby
into a Holiday Spa and get Sheena
Easton down here to oversee the
operation.”

The Governor also’ plans to
raisc tuition to cover the costs of

Finally, the Governor an-
nounced his intentions of turning
the annual room lottery into an
actual lottery. The student parking
spaces and class assignments
would also be decided by a lottery.
Tickets for cach event would cost

As forthe Governor's academic
policy, “Icouldcare less if the kids
Icarn anything or cven if they
graduate. The important thing is
that we keep the kids and their
moncy coming to Davidson.

I feel like Mr. Price really spoke to

D.G. Martin’s ‘blecding-heart’
convocation spcech of last fall,”
said another.

Some of Davidson's whitest white boys "get down" after Gwedolyn
Price's enlightened and enlightening lecture at convocation.

Other students’ were more re-
served in their responses. “‘I feel

_ proud to be a Davidson student in

the tradition of such white men as
Gwendolyn Price. In the midst of
cries for greater diversity both in
student body and curriculum
Price’s courage in standing up for
the status quo struck me as excep-
tional. He’s a real hero, you know,

like Ollie North.”

After priming his audience
with a few harmless racist and
sexist comments, Price turned to a
more serious subject and admon-

ished — the
Class of 1991
for their sup-
port of the

thought the

or some other
communist
conspiracy.
But now I
realize that Lefty Dreisell has been
behind Davidson’s downfall since
his departure.” Needless to. say, -
Davidson’s students, faculty and
staff were shocked by the news.

Price is currently on a lectur-
ing tour. He will next speak at Oral
Roberts University and conclude
ata David Duke fundraiser in Baton
Rouge. ;
