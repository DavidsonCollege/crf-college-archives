After facing criticism from the
faculty at their Wednesday meeting,
the third draft of the Code of Evalua-
tion went back to the Professional
Affairs Committee (PAC) for further
revision.

In addition to improvements in the

Code itself, the PAC will attempt to
assimilate suggestions regarding the
formation of.a Tenure Committee.
Although the faculty discussion of
the draft involved ‘‘substantial criti-

gains . séme understanding— some

cism of language,” according to PAC
member Anthony Abbott, he said, ‘‘On
the whole, there was a much stronger
consensus than we had last spring.

“The document is close to what we
will have,”” Abbott said.

He’ said one of PAC’s. main objec-
tives is to shorten the draft,. cutting
out much of the rhetoric and generally
making it clearer and more concise.

Abbott said faculty at the meeting
also sought clarification of the candi-
date’s right to ‘‘hear what is said about

He said he hopes the PAC will ‘‘write
intobhe document some means by
which the candidate being evaluated

means to improve.

“There is no mention in the present
draft,’’ he said. ;

Philosophy Professor Earl MacCor-
mac concurred, ‘“The whole point of
evaluation is to@nprove. 4s

Regarding PAC’s timetable for com-
pletion of revisions, PAC Chairman
Brown Patterson remarked, ‘‘We’re
moving along as fast as we can.”

Patterson said he hopes the PAC will
be able to present its revised draft and
possible tenure committee proposal to
the faculty in early October.

Regarding the Tenure Committee,

Patterson commented, ‘‘The idea has a
lot of support,”’ adding that the PAC is
working on the form the committee

would take, the powers, and the
method of selection of members and

-chairmen. -

The, Student Government Associa-
tion (SGA) passed a resolution Monday
urging the formation of a Tenure

Committee “‘in order to protect acade-

mic freedom and insure paciatimal
professionalism.’’

Patterson commented, ‘“Implica-
tions of the resolution seemed to be
that we hadn’t said anything about a
committee.”

He said, however, the PAC actually
had been considering its own plans for
such a committee, but had not released

them yet. eee PAC, page 2)

Views onDAV-
‘irreconcilable’

In an hour-long closed meeting Wednesday afternoon, College
President Samuel Spencer reportedly told WDAV Station Manager
Carrington Thompson that their views on the station’s future may
now be “‘irreconcilable.”’

Student Government Association President Bruce Brown, who
was asked to sit in on tre meeting by Spencer, quoted Davidson’s

PCC studies financial woes

By PEGGY BRITT

The Patterson Court Coun-
cil’s Finance Committee pre-
sented its report last night on
the financial problems which
have been plaguing some eating
houses. ,

Last spring, the financial
problems of Patterson Court
became apparent when three of
the houses were unable to meet
costs and had to borrow ‘‘some-
thing under $1000’ each, ac-

cording to Business Manager

Robert Currie. The money,
loaned by the College, is to be
paid back by the end of winter

Although these loans solve
the immediate financial difficul-
ties of the three ‘houses, the
underlying causes remain a
threat—and not just to these
particular houses.

Every eating. house suffers
from what both Currie and Ed
Reese, Chairman of the Patter-
son Court Council (PCC) Fi-
nance Committee, consider the
biggest problem: poor money

management due to the inexpe- :

' yience of the treasurers.

The second problem is less
widespread, but, when added to
the budget-balancing difficul-

ties, caused the three houses to’

go under: the mobility of mem-
bers among houses. When
someone switches houses his
former house loses his money
but the house’s expenses remain
nearly the same. When mem-
bership drops below a certain
point, the houses lose money.

Last spring, the business '

office recommended that each
house member pay a deposit of
$50 to be returned at the énd of

the year—if he remains at. his
original house. rs

Thus, people will be encou-
raged to finish the year at that
house. If they leave anyway,

the deposit will help alleviate .

the loss.

“It’s the most equitable
way,”’ says Currie.

Reese disagrees, ‘‘We should
try a comprehensive. budgeting
system before resorting to the
$50 deposit—it’s awfully dras-
tic for a first step.”

He believes, because all the
eating houses have budgeting
problems, it would be: best to
try. to alleviate those first. If an-

alternate solution is found,

there would be no need to try to
force people to remain ata
certain house.

But the biggest trouble with
the $50 deposit idea, is, accor

ding to Reese, is that “It just
won't sell.” He feels that stu-
dents are forced to pay enough
for board already, especially on:
top of Davidson’s high tuition

and fees.

With these considerations in
mind, the finance committee
has drawn up a list of recom-
mendations to go before the
PCC. These recommendations
include proposals to:

1. Have members sign a list
near the end of each term if they
want to be counted for member-
ship. This would allow the
treasurer to form a budget in
advance and present it at the
end of each term to the business
office for suggestions.

2. Elect assistant treasurers
during winter term so that they
can learn the ropes before
taking full-office. If possible,
they should take (or audit)
introductory accounting.

’ 3. Have monthly meetings
between treasurers and busi-
ness office representatives.

4. Have each house determine
a minimun number of people at
which it can operate in the
black, In case it falls below that
level; house should be author-
ized to levy additional charges
to members.

chief executive as telling Thompson, ‘‘We’ll agree to disagree.”

Brown himself said the meet-
ing clearly ‘‘came to.an im-
passe’ over the question of how
WDAV should best serve the
music needs of its possibly two
million listeners.

Spencer has recently come
under fire for telling WDAV

staff members they must spend -

at least half of their air time

’ broadcasting classical music by
~ November 15, like it or not.

He cautiously backed away
from the November deadline
this week, saying WDAV will
not be forced to alter their
programming schedule until
they have had a chance to
explain their position to the
Executive Committee of the
Board of Trustees.

The Committee may be able
to meeti with the students in
early October, according to
Spencer, so the November
deadline is not yet. completly
cut of the question.

In a carefully worded five-
page statement released after
the closed meeting, Spencer
explained, ‘‘When I found this
summer that only one-third of
our air time was devoted to
classical music, I stated that we
must reach at least 50 percent
to meet the Trustees’ directive
and to deal honestly with
persons who had given major
support to the station in its
initial phase.

“I felt that this was a reason-
able compromise between what
most péople would ‘probably
expect and what student staff
members desired in program-
ming, though I-had no guaran-
tee that the Trustees would
consider the 50. percent level
satisfactory.

“It is now apparent that even
the 50 percent compromise is

considered too restrictive by the: —

drinks °°

By CHARLES ERWIN
News Editor

Despite the recent passage of
a liquor-by-the-drink
referendum in Mecklenburg
County, College officials said
early this. .week. they will not
authorize the sale of mixed
drinks in the 900 Room.

When queried on the subject
Monday afternoon, College Pre-
sident Samuel Spencer hesita-
ted, then said, ‘‘That has not
been even raised in my presence
and that would come. . . any
recommendation about campus
life would come from the Dean
of Students.”

About that time Dean of

~ Students Will Terry entered

Spencer’s.office. Asked if he
planned to make such a recom-
mendation, Terry flatly
answered, “‘No,”’

‘“‘Most of the students on
campus are not 21, among other
things, which is the legal rule
for here. Secondly, I doubt
seriously the trustees would
approve it. And I suspect if I
authorized such a thing, they
would intercept my authori-
zation,’ Terry explained.

Spencer turned to Terry and
said, “That is the first time that
it had even occurred to me.
Nobody had even raised the

tion.” 4

“Well, it had occurred to
Terry: snapped. “My -
Lord, we'd have to give a keg“of
martinis every time we needed
to, rather than a keg of beer.”
