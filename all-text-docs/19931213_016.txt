Unbelievable: some thoughts on 1993 Wildcat Hoops

By James F. Jackson, III

Here’s toall the fans that went
to the Wake game last week. In
that game, improvement was evi-
dent in our team--they played with
discipline-and, more importantly,
heart. The sophomores really
stepped up, especially Chris Alpert
and Brandon Williams. Our guys
played a tremendous defensive
game, especially Brandon, who
guarded a conspicuously taller and
heavier player.

No one deserves more credit,
though, than Coach Bob McKillop.
The Cats executed and shot tre-
mendously against Wake; the credit
for the renewed discipline and ag-

gressiveness should go greatly to
the coach. The loss against Wake
is by nomeans a demoralizing one.
It shows our capabilities and al-
lows us to release some tension so
we can compete with and beat other
good teams, like UNCC.

I think it was also important
that McKillop and the Cats beat
UNCCwith Lefty Dreisell present.
Coach McKillop has constantly
proven himself as a coach and is
due a lot more credit than he gets.
The fourth row crew is behind you
all the way, Coach.

Muchoftheimprovementcan .

be attributed to the way the sopho-
mores have stepped up. Chris

“Alpert has always been a leader,

but Jeff Anderson, Mark McGuire,
and George Spain have also im-
proved. And, after the UNCC
game, hats off to Quinn “Hair
World” Harwood. He was clutch
when Davidson needed it, includ-
ing two key second half three-
pointers in the face of UNCC de-
fenders. In the last three games, he
has also lunged for loose balls. We
love that heart on the part of Quinn
and the rest of the sophomores.
The go-to guy is still Janko
Narat. The guy is quiet, reserved,
and unemotional, but he gives all
he has every time he steps on the
court. He has already proven why

as most of ours. But it seemed like
he at least had a hand on just about
every rebound out there. He was a
presence.
Oh yeah, he scored 19 points,
too. He took it to the hole (left and
right handed), hit the three, and
handled the ball with confidence.
The thing is, I don’t know that
Harwood’s necessarily gonna’ star
for the Wildcats every night. Surely
Narat and Zimmerman are gonna’
get their points, but it seems like
the rest of the scoring is going to be
done by committee. One night it’1l
be Alpert or Donnelly from the
outside, Jeff ‘Anderson or Will-
iams going to the hole, or Mark

McGuire and George Spain in the
paint. Most likely, the points will
come from a combination thereof.
And that’s the way it should be.
And good gosh, do they hustle
or what?! There seemed to be two
or three white jerseys diving for
every single loose ball. Ifthe Char-
lotte Hornets’ “hustle stats”
scoreboard had been in Belk arena
Saturday night, it would have at-
tested to the Cats’ tenacity. They
were scrappin’ and playin’ hard.

‘That’ll win you some games.

So will confidence. The other
night, the Wildcats lost on the road
to Wake Forest in a pretty close
game. Beforehand I asked McGuire
whether he thought they had a
chance to win against ACC com-

petition.

“We will beat them,” he told
me, almost matter-of-factly. Well,
they didn’t. But McGuire’s state-
ment said something about this
team. They realize that they can
play, and they expect to win games.
They know that if they can only
win the Southern Conference tour-
nament, they can wind up in the
NCAA’s big dance. It can be done.

This is clearly the best team
Davidson has put on the floor in
some time. They’re fun to watch,
they’ve got good athletes and good
team leaders, and they’ve been
coached to play hard. Now
Davidson, let’s make sure there
are fewer empty seats at these close
games. We gotta believe.

he was a pre-season All-Southern
Conference pick. The heart and
soul of the team is with Janko, and
the other guys know it.

Personally, I find it embar-
rassing’ that our -walk-ons, Chris
Shields and Tim Caldwell, don’t
have their names on their jerseys.
Those two guys put their butts on
the line just as much as any other
player and should not be discrimi-
nated against because they are not
on scholarship. Not only is it em-
barrassing to them, it’s embarrass-
ing to Davidson.

Behind me at the Wake game
were two Wake fans commenting
on how cheap Davidson looked
when Caldwell ran onto the court
with no name on his jersey. That’s
just cheap. And, considering the
fact that it can’t cost more than ten
bucks to get it done, it’s even worse.
It’s high time our walk-ons get the

credit they deserve, especially
when they play almost every game.
Here’s to you Tim and Chris. Do-
nations can be sent c/o Bob Pascal
in NBE 203.

I -miss the frequent fan plan
this year. For some of us, that was
another reason to attend games.
We should do all we can to get
students to basketball games: T-
shirts thrown out by starters and
the frequent fan plan are an easy
way to do that. I hope these two
will be continued in the future.
Until then, though, it’s the job of
every red-blooded Davidson stu-
dent to get tickets for Sunday
afternoon’s game versus Clemson
in the Charlotte Coliseum.

Tickets go on sale Wednes-
day at 1:00 p.m. at the Baker ticket
office. Let’s see Davidson students
finally give this team the credit
they deserve.
