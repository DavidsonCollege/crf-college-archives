Library Displays Recent
Commemorative Stamps

Prof. Kimbrough, Harmon
Woodward Lend to
Exhibit .

In the display case in our library
is a varied and excellent display
of unused United States stamps in
Dlocks and sheets. A large number
belong to Harmon Woodward, a
senior, and some’ to Professor J. T.
Kimbrough.

This assortment of stamps should
be of great interest, not only to
stamp collectors, but the student
body as a whole. There are a great
number of imperforate souvenir
sheets which have been especially
popular under Postmaster General
James J. Farley. All of these com-
memorate some historic event or
personage in the United States his-
tory or some event’ that is to take
place, such as Mother's .Day.

in this collection there are the

unused stamps which have been.

most recently issued. It is the

Army-Navy series of 1937. There
are two more yet to be issued, how-
ever. They, are to be the five cent
Army stamp depicting West Point,
and the five cent Navy stamp de-
picting the Naval Academy at An-

napolis.. - .

Theré is also the National Parks
set, which ranges from one to ten
cents. These have scenes from tlie
National Park which they are cele-
brating by issuing that series of
stamps.
vestigate this display are asked to
note the imperforate blocks refer-
red to as “Farley Imperiorates.”

In the Airmail collection, there
are displayed a series of China
Clipper Stamps. The twenty cent,
twenty-five cent, and fifty cent Air-
mail. stamps have been issued for
trans-Pacific mail to Hawaii, the
Philippines and China. These were
loaned by Professor J. T. Kini-
brough.
