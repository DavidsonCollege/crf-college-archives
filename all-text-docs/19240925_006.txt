THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 25, 1924.

J. F. Milhous Elected

Business Mgr. Annual

Owing to the failure of T. B. Brown to
return to college this fall, an important
and responsible’ position was left vacant;
ramely that of the business manager of
the Quips and Cranks.
the most important positions on the an-
nual staff and one involving a lot of hard
work and responsibility.

The Staff then appointed J. F. Milhous
to fill this vacancy. His name was then
put before the class of ’25 and he was
elected by acclamation,

Milhous has had some expereince along
the business end of putting out an annual,
having helped the business manager of
Jast year solicit adds.

The staff is hard at work already and,

with an efficient man running the finan- |

cial end, the 1925 annual promises to be
one of the best that has ever been pub-
lished.

COACH TILSON ISSUES CALL

(Continued from page 1)
men train hard enough, and Tilson thinks
they are fast enough, he will send them to
the mect. He told the men, though, that if
they did not work, they need not expect hint
to send them to the meet.

The men pledged themselves to work out
this fall, so that they would be in shape
next spring. Each afternoon there will be
a schedule put up on the bulletin board in
the gym, and the men can see what they are
expected to do for that afternoon .

As to the band, when they rendered
“Tain’t gonna rain no more,” practically

all Freshmen and even a few upper-

classemen looked perplexed, and after’

a moment’s hesitation doffed their caps.
How's this for patriotism?

This is one of

Court Lays Down Rules
Governing Fresh Class
Court Awaits Decision of Student

Council Concerning Proposed
Punishment

At the only meeting of the Court of
| Control held to date, several matters of
|importance were considered and passed
|upon. One of the most important things
| was the decision of the punishment to be
iinflicted upon erring Freshmen. Several
;new means of punishment were decided
|upon, and the court awaits the consent
| of the student council to put these meas-
| ures into effect. No Freshmen were
| before the court, the judge’ says that he
| has the names of several who will be

j tried at the next meeting.

The court decided that Monday night
| would be the regular court night. Each
j}man will notified in time for him to
limake his appearance, and punishment
will be announced in chapel next morn-
‘ing.

The Freshman class has been divided
j into four groups, and each Wednesday
night for the next four weeks they will
| meet in the classrooms of Shearer Hall,
jtight after supper. Four men of .the
| Senior class have been ¢hosen to lecture
to these groups. Jim Hendrix will talk
on athletics, Bub Oeland on the social life
of the campus, Mac Beall on school
spirit, and Harry Price on the religious
activities of the school.

It seems to be the feeling in the up-
per classes that a man is playing a dirty
trick on a freshman if he turns him up.
The court was instituted by the student
body to control the Freshmen, and Judge
Ramsey that the court cannot
handle a Freshman unless he is turned
up. Therefore, he says, each man should
not feel that he is playing a dirty trick
on the Freshman by turning him up, but

says

he should feel that he’ is helping the
spirit of Davidson, for it is in this way |
that spirit will be instilled into the}
Freshman class.

Cheviots are the thing on the
campts this fall. Particularly
the light colored patterns, in
wide stripes and herringbone
effects. These fabrics make up
best in the loose, easy college
styles; the two go together

‘very effectively.

We have a rich assortment
of these, cut by Society Brand.
The correct college models,
two and three button, and an
endless variety of cheviots
and the rougher fabrics. We
are very glad to show you
these; you, too, are bound to: :

like them.

| R. O. T. C. News

Probably the first department of Da-
|vidson to get down to hard work after
ithe opening of school this year was the
lunit of R.O. T. C. Even on the opening
‘day, September 11th, an order was issued
from the armory building, in which the
|orficers and most of the non-coms were
officially informed of their appointments
|It seems that all students taking the

: | advanced course have been appointed

leither officers or sergeants, although a
| sufficient number. of corporals has not
/been made, it is understood that within
\the near future many a Sophomore may
|be seen proudly exhibiting his double
| stripe. Captain Weems is reported as
| saying that even a few sergeants would
appointed from the second year men.
The battalion organization is on the
}same general plan as that of last year.
Headquarters consists of J. A. Lake, the
new Major;.J. R. Gudger, Captain and
| Adjutant; J. B. Hall, First Lieutenant
and Supply Officer; and the color str-
'geants, C. E. Houston and G. W. Smith.
J, R. Earnest has been appointed Cap-
‘tain and leader of the band. He is as-
| sisted by Second Lieutenant Tootie Cray-
fton. W. C. Ramsey is Captain of Com-
jpany A. His lieutenants are J. A.
Thompson and T. A. Guiton. H. Y. Alex-
ander is First Sergeant. The Captain of
Company B is J. P. Hendrix; First Lieu-
tenants are M. D, Thomasson and C. S.
Furches, D. G. Wilson is First Sergeant.
Company C has for its Captain, L. B.
Gibbs, and for its lieutenants, W. A. Pat-
terson and O. P. Matthews. B. U. Ratch-
{ford is First Sergeant. R. T. Kimzey is
| Captain of Company He has as his
lieutenants, R. E. Boggs, W. I. Howell
and L. B. Hnie. Tom Baker is First
Sergeant.’

MAXWELL CHAMBERS HOTEL
(Continued from page 1)

He stated that he is already looking forward

to many evenings of pleasant conversation

with Dr. Harding around a vhotel dining

table.

The wonderful change which has taken
place in hotel management during the last
two or three centuries was described in Dr.
Currie’s talk. Whereas the old English
inn-keeper conspired with highwaymen and
coach drivers to rob his guests, the patrons
of a modern hotel are not exposed to this
danger on account of the stringent laws
govering the management of hotels.

Mr. Jackson gave a number of interesting
statistics proving that Davidson has been
enjoying a Steady and prosperous growth
since he came here in 1917. One significant
indication of growth was the increase in thy:
college registration frorh 220 in 1917 -to 620
for the present year.

Captain Weems advised Mr. Wilson to not
get too many boys together at one time if he
expected to get the best results. Dr. Fleagle
related a number of humorous experiences
that he has had in the hotels he has stayed at
during his travels. Sometime he expects to
collect these anecdotes into book form.

Rev. Mr. Bennet, pastor of the local M.
E. Church, and Dr. Richards, of the Pres-
byterian Church, each gave a short talk.

In conclusion Mr. Wilson invited all fae-
ulty members and their wives to attend a
dinner at the hotel Monday evening as his
guests.

college at the front in such college activi-
ties. He has proven his worth in the
dramatic field, and his plans for this year
will no doubt make the work a great success.
Not detracting a bit from credit due
Coaches Monk and Tex for work last year,
last spring and this year, much might be
said concerning the part that Coach Rawson
had in the machine that Davidson will soon
be proud of. Under his tutoring, Leggette,
Pinkney, and Mitchell changed last fall from
third string Freshmen to regulars of varsity
calibre. There were other Sophomores who
showed up splendidly, but it is these three
who might especially be called Rawson
products,
