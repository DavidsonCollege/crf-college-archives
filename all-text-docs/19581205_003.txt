in line to take the conference crown away from less po-
tent West Virginia, but the success or failure of this
year’s team depends on the performance of certain Key |
men.

The scoring Tuesday night, with the exception of
two points, was shared by only three men, Semi
Mintz, Dave Hollingsworth and Bill Shinn. |

The fence rail Mintz will control the play on the
court this year as floor captain. Possessor of a deadly out-!
side shot, Semi will also be the playmaker of the squad.
Defense is another one of his strong points.

Hollingsworth, who played one of the better games,

of his career Tuesday, will be a consistent scorer with,
his hook and jump shots. Dave may also lead the team

in rebounding.
Bill Shinn, fifteen pounds heavier than last
year, should also be tough on the boards. Bill has

possibly the best shot on the squad in his tong jump
one-hander, but needs to shoot more often.

The performance of men in the other two positions

will make the difference this year. At center will be Joc

Milner. Milner’s height, six-six, gives the team a defi-
nite psychological advantage and if he continues his re-
cent improvement, he should be a valuable member of
the club. He played well against Wake Forest even
though he didn't dent the scoring column, and Scott
commented that his loss via the foul route hurt us con-
siderably. Scrapper Joe Markee, a six-four soph with a

good shot, will see action at center, but will make some
unavoidable sophomore mistakes.

The other guard position is still a question mark.
Red Fergeson got the call Tuesday since Wake Forest
used a small man in Charlie Forte. The “Bug” possesses
a tremendous amount of court savvy, and has a fine one-
hander but is hampered by his relatively small stature.

Breathing down his neck for a starting position
are John Stafford and John Huie. Stafford, a high
jumping six-footer, has a good outside eye and
handles the ball fairly well. Huie, perhaps the best
hustler on the team, is a good driver, but lacks a
consistant long range weapon.

Season With Pieiffer

On Tuesday night. Dec. 9. at 7:30 the Davidson wrestling team will open its '58-
‘59 season against Pfeiffer College. Pfeiffer should have a strong team this year
with almost all its jettermen returning, many of them seeing their fourth year of
action. The Wildcat squad also boasts a strong lineup of lettermen on the '58-'59
version that should be improved over lastyear.

With the exception of the
loss of tetterman Bobby Me-
Intyre for the season, the
‘Cat grapplers should be at
full strength for Tuesday’s
opener. McIntyre is on the in-
jury list with a shoulder ail-
ment.

Asked for a comment on the
prospects of this season. Coach
Parker said thal sinee the sea

Ita Psi

By BILL GODWIN
The bright spot in Davidson's chapter of Sigma Delta
Psi this year is occupied by Chris Bremer, who as a soph-

omore last. year broke the
record in bar vaulting.

His outstanding effort of
seven feet, five-and-three qaurt-
er inches supplanted the old
mark: 7 3%".

The loeal Alpha Upsilon chap-
ter, under the supervision of
Coach Heath Whittle, is com-

posed of students who. have.

mastered the 10 tests required
for admission. As soon as a stu-
dent passes these tests, he is
authorized as a member of the
national athletic honorary fra-
ternity to wear its key and to

to Coach Whittle. He urges all
interested boys to contact him
at any time.

Davidson is one of 104 col-
leges and universities through-
out the United States which
compose Sigma Delta Psi. The
highlight of each year's activi-
ties is a spring national champ-
ionship contest, which is not
restricted to members.

Each college selects the ree-
ords of ten men who have
passed. at least five of the tests
and places them in national
competition. By a point basis
trophies are awarded to the best
team and to the superior indi-
vidual in each test. .Davidson
dast won the team championship
in 1938.

SINCE 1930
Sigma. Delta Psi was organ-

a

ized in 1912 and Davidson Col-—

lege joined in 1930. In every
year since then, Davidson's
chapter has been supervised by
Coach Whittle, who graduated
in 1929.

Two of the chapter members
who belong from last year are
Dave Warden, who completed
the requirements, as a fresh-
man, and John Heath West.
