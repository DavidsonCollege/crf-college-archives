Cats
pound
Western
Carolina

By WARREN BuFoRD

Driving three hours to the
mountains of North Carolina to
play Western Carolina in rugby
was not a pleasant experience, but
the game itself was.

RUGBY

Saturday afternoon, the rugby
team crushed the Catamounts of
Western Carolina, 46-0.

The Wildcats came out strong
and played their finest first half of
any game this season. They scored
on six of eight tries, played tre-
mendous defense, won most scrum
downs and silenced the crowd dur-
ing those first 45 minutes.

Sophomore Frank’ Killian
started the scoring with a strong
20-yard run into the try zone. Jer-
emy Potter, Simon Priestly and
Graham Powell also added a try
each. Scrum captain Tom
Shelburne added two tries.

The Wildcats played excel-
lent defense all day. Everybody
tackled effectively and played ag-
gressively to secure the shutout.
Western had two opportunities to
score, setting up both times on the
goal line, but the Catamounts were
blocked out each
Davidson’s goal line defense.

The second half was less of a
highlight film, but saw some ex-
cellentrugby. In particular, hooker
Scott Young and the entire scrum
won almostevery ball enabling the
wings to execute almost every play
successfully.

Young also scored one of the
two second half tries. Senior John
Walsh scored the other try with a
long run down the sideline.

The win moved the squad one
step closer to a perfect season giv-
ing Davidson a 3-0 record. That
mark will be challenged next week
when the Wildcats take on county
rival UNCC.

The men’s baseball team
didn’t have much of a vacation,
taking on several important South-
ern Conference foes over spring
break in addition to facing some
tough nonconference opponents.

BASEBALL

The Wildcats kicked off their
break with a sweep of Appala-
chian State on Mar. 4-5. Davidson
outscored the Mountaineers by a
combined 29-7 in the three-game
romp. Mordecai Stolk, Chris Pol-

lard and Jonathan Coulombe all
pitched complete games for the
Wildcats.

Pitching and defense remained
strong in the next two games, but
the offense wasn’t. Despite astrong
showing from pitcher Mills Ariail,
Campbell came away with a 2-1
win. Brian Cole pitched well in the
following game, but James Madi-
son, boasting a pitcher who was
drafted in the fifth round of the
major league draft last year, pre-
vailed 2-0.

Davidson closed their spring
break schedule with a three-game
series against The Citadel, which
was a preseason pick to finish sec-
ond in the conference. After split-

Friday, the women’s tennis
team started off their conference
season with an impressive win
against Western Carolina.

MEN'S & WOMEN'S
TENNIS

The team swept all three
doubles matches to capture the
doubles point, and they continued
to play well into the singles
matches. Senior co-captains
Kimberely Nance and Nicole
Wilcox pulled out tough matches
and led the team to the 7-0 victory.

Saturday, the Wildcats con-

tinued conference play on the road
against Appalachian State. The
doubles matches were close at first,
but Davidson pulled through with
the victories to capture that point
for the second day in a row.

In the process, Jane Stubbs
and Ashley Maner won the third
straight doubles victory at the num-

ber two position, putting their dual
match record at 4-3. In the singles,
freshman Lynne Hall won her fifth
consecutive match at the number
five position, helping the team
come away with a 6-1 win.

The squad’snextmatch comes

today at home against Georgia
Southern.
After a restful spring break, the
men’s tennis team returned early
to sharpen their skills heading into
one of its toughest weeks of the
season. The squad opened a stretch
of four matches in five days Thurs-
day, including one against last
year’s conference champion, Geor-
gia Southern.

Davidson played well in the
first three matches of the stretch
through Sunday’s contest against
The Citadel, which gave coach Jeff
Frank the 399th victory of his
Davidson career.

The Wildcats first match was
Thursday against Radford.
Davidson, opened by taking two
out of the top three doubles matches
to go up 1-0. Strong singles play
propelled the Wildcats to the im-
pressive 5-2 victory.

Saturday, Davidson faced
Richmond, one of their toughest

opponents all year. Richmond
swept the three doubles matches
and quickly won two of the singles
to take a 3-0 lead. The Wildcats

needed to win all four of the re-
maining singles matches.

Slagle pulls out of running for Richmond job

By Matt Pitzer
Sports Editor

Men’s soccer coach Charlie
Slagle recently withdrew his name
from consideration for the same
position at Richmond.

SOCCER

- Slagle’s name first came up
for the Spiders’ vacant job back in

January and negotiations appar-
ently reached a fairly serious level

in February when Richmond paid -

for Slagle to visit the school for an
interview.

But in the days just before
spring break, Slagle informed Rich-
mond of his decision to remain at
Davidson.

“My roots are pretty tied here,”
he said. “The overall job here was
just better. If it was strictly the
soccer job, it would have been a bit
more interesting.”

Some of those roots include a
camp that Slagle will run for the
15th year this summer. Slagle also
graduated from Davidson in 1975.

As coach, he led the Wildcats
to one of the greatest athletic ac-
complishments in school history
when his team advanced to the
final four in 1992, also the first
year the championships were held
here.

' Slagle said he received “as-
surances, but nothing official” from
Davidson that, among other things,

“I could coach here basically as
long as I want.” He apparently
also received a pledge from the
school that he could continue run-
ning his camp at will."
Speculation had grown that
Slagle might be interested in jump-
ing to the Spiders, especially con-
sidering that Richmond will host
the final four this coming fall.
Slagle, of course, played a
large part in, first, convincing the
NCAA to award the champion-
ships to Davidson and, second,

ensuring that the tournament ran
very smoothly in each of its three
years here.

"Just to be associated with the
national championships wouldn't
be a big enough benefit for me," he
said.

_ More important to Slagle was
his commitment to Davidson.

"My whole goal is to keep the
status quo whenever possible,”
Slagle said. “I like to think of my-
self as part of Davidson and, hope-
fully, vice-versa.”
