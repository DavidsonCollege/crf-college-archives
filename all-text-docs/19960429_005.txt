THE DAVIDSONIAN

~ GOODBYE

And so we bid farewell to the class of 1996. Since they arrived as
nervous freshmen in 1992, they have seen ourschool change in
dramatic ways. However, as they now leave us to exit the bubble
and enter the “real world,” they will take it all with them — the
honor code, the study regimen, the friendships, the
friendliness ... even a working knowledge of flickerball.

In three more weeks seniors
will be going, going, gone. But,
by the looks of where they are
going it will be to bigger and
newer places.

Arandom sampling:
Mark McGuire looks for-
ward to teaching in the JET pro-
gram. He says, “I will be teaching
English to little kids. My goal is
to spénd two years there and then‘
go back to school.”

About 12 seniors have been
accepted to“ law school so far.
Among those schools are

Harvard, UVA, UNC, William and

Mary, andthe University of Florida.
Kim Kreiling will be doing

missionary work in Cambodia.

Some fortuitous survivors of
the Pre-Med program will be going
on med school. Some ten seniors
have already decided on a school
that accepted them.

Other seniors will be working
in consulting firms, pursuing doc-
torates and other post graduate de-
grees, and overall just starting to
climb their way up ‘the career lad-
der.

John Ballard will be going to
Tulane University. He says, “I am
going to pursue a. masters in Latin

American studies. I was offered
a fellowship with the stipulation
that I enroll in Portuguese. It is a
two year program and I am inter-
ested in exploring the possibili-
ties.” ;
However for some people.
the future is not so clear.
Former SGA President Bill
Gullan states his post graduation
life is, “‘yet to be determined.”
Michael Bode says, “I have
gained an excellent education. It
will make for'good conversation’
in the unemployment line.”
Over all some 200 seniors
have listed definite future career
plans.

became the catch phrase. From the
Commons to the Court, attention
to the divide between men and
women might have brought us to-
gether, at least for a time.

As if taking flack for gender
problems is not enough, Patterson
Court had other problems, too. A
miscalculation left five houses in
debt to the college. And a rousing
celebration turned into a bonfire
worthy of police attention.

Most significant, the alcohol
policy went on a carousel ride of
changes. First we all wore wrist-
bands. Then the risk of spending
all of the PCC’s risk management
budget made it mandatory only for
those over 21.

Wristbands became a moot

issue as soon as the Self-Study
recommended a ban on kegs. We
wanted them to stay, but we fought
even harder for the Court as a
whole. The trustees voted to ban
the kegs, but did not address house
purchase of alcohol — avoiding
the extreme of BYOB. However,
Court presidents say that next year
there will be fewer open parties
due to rules of national chapters.
For those who wanted a court
alternative, “If you build it, they
will come” became a social motto.
Plans for a new Union were un-
veiled. The International Students
Association pursued the idea of an

International House. And a group
of students without an organiza-
tion are pushing for another co-ed
eating house.

But we donotjust build houses
for ourselves. After a huge
fundraising drive, we are now rais-
ing a Habitat House for a family
from the Davidson community.

RLO has plans to do some

building as well. Knox, Akers, and .

Irwin will get much needed atten-
tion over the summer. As was the
case for the first time this year, one
of them will again have a co-ed
hall.

Davidson was published in
Security World magazine for be-
ing a safe campus. Maybe it was
the new car the police got, or the
new 911 system that we now call
9-911.

Politics had its place. Offcam-
pus, a few of our fellow students
joined the million men who
marched in Washington, D.C. On
campus it was quieter. Warren
Buford and Sara Beth Hamlin
slipped quietly into office unop-
posed.

Not to say they have not been
noticed. The SGA tried to reach
outside with the Phonathon, and it
turned toward the inside with Dorm
Storm.

The Union revived the
Jumpin’ Java, later joined off-
campus by Cosmic Coffee.

Wedined on Left Over Salmon
in the fall, with a little bit of Rusted
Root, and we frolicked in the spring
with Squirrel Nut Zippers.

Andour own orchestra played °

both a first and a last when Richard
Prior’ s Phoenix Rising debued with
retiring James Swisher as the pia-
nist.

Some came to Davidson not

- to play or sing, but to speak. Harry

Wu talked about human rights,
Cornel West about how to make it
right. Christina Hoff Summers dis-
cussed the face of feminism,
Frederick Buechner, the faces of
Jesus.

Speakers are not the only ones
we listened to. Now WALT plays
what WDAV cannot. And “The
South’s Foremost College
Weekly” was complemented by
Libertas.

Competition was fierce in the
sports arena. An awesome season
otherwise, Davidson Basketball
lost the Southern Conference tour-
nament, and with it our bid to the
NCAA.

We said hello to Jim Murphy
as the new Athletic Director, but
have begun to bid farewell to
Kuykendall, who announced he
will resign at the end of next year.

So it goes with students as
well. The seniors will march in
front of Dana within a month, leav-
ing the class of 97 to take the
reigns and the class of ’00 to bring
up the rear.

Forum on religion sparks
debate, but inconclusive

By ANN HATFIELD
Staff Writer

This past Wednesday, War-
ren Buford conducted an open fo-
rum on religion at Davidson. The
panel consisted of Chaplain and
Chairman of the Ecumenical Coun-
cil Rob Spach, Matt Rich, Sarah
Gephardt, Julie O’Connor, FCA
President Eric Sapp, Seth Clippard,
and IVCF President Macon Stokes.

With the Easter crosses con-
flict serving as an impetus, stu-
dents expressed their concerns
about the religious climate and di-
versity at Davidson. Though a
controversial topic, students man-
aged to check their passions at the
door and engage in effective dis-
cussion.

Buford opened the floor by
asking each of the panelists what
they liked best and least about re-
ligious life at Davidson. Responses
ran the gamut: Stressing the posi-
tive, Stokes and Rich emphasized
the sense of community and the
many religious options available
to students, while Clippard,
O’Connor and Gephardt cited the
shortage of religious options and.
diversity as their preeminent con-
cerns.

Spach, Stokes, Sapp, and Rich
pointed out the wealth of Christian
organizations on campus and the
different voice and focus of each.
They argued that among Davidson
Christians, diversity thrived. Some
panelists, however, expressed the
belief that for a non-Christian,
Davidson provides no home.

Jewish student and panelist
Sarah Gephardt felt that Davidson
attitudes fostered defensiveness
among non-Christians. Gephardt
says, “Davidson falsely advertises
to prospective students when it
pretends to be a school of religious
diversity.” Disillusioned with cam-
pus attitudes, she adds “I would
never suggest it [Davidson] to any-
one of a non-Christian tradition or
an open mind.”

From the floor, Kelly
Cunningham expressed her own
opinion that Davidson had become
embittered and “polarized” over
the religion issue. She called for
“increased dialogue.”

After an hour and a half of
thoughtful, but inconclusive de-
bate, Buford closed the forum by
challenging each participant to for-
mulate suggestions to improve re-
ligious relations at Davidson.

Flannagan will teach

in English department

By JONATHAN SIPLING
Staff Writer

Facing an opening next year

inthe Englishdepartment, theCol-

lege conducted a nationwide search
process for a professor to fill the
position. They have decided to hire
Dr. Brenda Flannagan, an Afri-
can-American English professor
currently teaching in Michigan.
She will be coming next year as a
full Professor of English.

Davidson is. making a con-
certed effort to bring more minor-
ity faculty to campus. Robert
Williams, Vice President of Aca-
demic Affairs and Dean of Fac-
ulty, says the size of the applicant
pool has proven the most prob-
lematic stumbling block.

Areas like physics simply turn
out very few African-American
Ph.D.’s, causing the college to tar-
get areas like anthropology, En-

eee

glish, and history, where the viable
applicant pools are larger and
Davidson has met with greater suc-
cess.

“‘We’re an equal opportunity
employer ... We don’t have an af-
firmative action agreement with
the government, but we take extra
steps to recruit minority faculty
whenever appropriate,” Williams
said.

Flannagan has come to
Davidson in the past to lecture and,

Most recently, a year ago on a

visiting appointment.

Williams notes that you can’t
approach these searches in the usual
way, or you won’t be able to hire
the minority faculty you want.
“Ultimately, our principle is to hire
the best qualified candidates ... But,
depending on how you define the
search, you can guarantee that you
will fail or succeed to attract mi-
nority candidates.”

Good luck on that baby.
