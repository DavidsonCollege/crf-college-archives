a

Corner...

By Newt Spencer
This is a big yeat for Davidson
—and for all you Davidsonians, In
fact we are closer to.normal than
we have been for a long time. It’s
wonderful. Our friends and upper-
classmen. who have returned from

their duties with Uncle Sam are
doing a fine job of re-vigorating the
real Davidson “Wildcat” — Spirit.
Their influence is a great help, and
we're certainly happy, and thank-
ful that these boys are back with
us. Bill Rogers, president of the
student body, and Bill McLean,
president of the “Y") Art Roach,

Jim Sample, John McAlister, Dick
Winters, Joe Martin, Joe Fountain,
Jim Mann Gene Linton are
some our Davidson men
have returned to campus after tak-
ing active part in the fight for-our
freedom. We are proud of these
returned veterans—they are living
examples of what we mean by the
term “old genuine Davidson men.”
Everyone of them is of the highest
“calibre” —through and_ through.
Freshmen! These are the kind of
boys we want you to follow—these
are excellent ¢xamples of the kind
of Davidson Spirit that we want
you new men to inherit. It’s the

and

of who

finest Davidson has to offer—it's
what helps to make Davidson—
DAVIDSON,

The “Y” Cabinet opened this year
with a real promise of Service to
the Student Body, to the College,
and to the Community. Bill McLean
has selected a “top-notch” group of
boys to head up the various depart-
ments of the “Y". Our retreat to
Montreat “kni#’ the organization
tightly together. Each department
of student activity was thoroughly
considered in our “Panel Discus-
sions’ which lasted for seven long
hours.—Suggestions and plans for
improvements were _made—Ways
and means of better serving the
Student Body were discussed—all in
all we drew up a splendid program
for this year. After returning to
campus—the cabinet did not for-
get the plans it drew up—the mem-
bers of the cabinet got..down to
work immediately. Take my word
—this is going to be a year in which
the “Y” is going to stand out in
front as far as Service is concerned.
We are determined to be Active
Christians this year and always. If
any of you have any criticisms or
suggestions that may help us carry
on our work please feel free to ex-
press these comments to any cabinet
member. Stop in at the “Y” office
—any time—and get them off your
chest. ,

Already, the schedule for this
Semester is beinning to look cram-
med.’ Queens-Davidson Day! 200
Girls and Ed Golden, Ed, by the way
is doing a fine job organizing the
“blind dates” for this gala occasion.
Here’s hoping that all of you have a
happy evehing—and here’s hoping,
too, that you meet the girl that you
have been looking for. More about
the social plans Myers Park Pres-
byterian Church of Charlotte, N. G
has inquired about the possibilities
sof having 50 Freshmen over to a
party for their Young People’s Group
which is composed of Queens Girls.
What are the possibilities? See Ed
Golden—first come, first go!

Thanks go to the “Pre-Ministerial
Club” which has been of real service
to the members of the Synod. These
boys played “host’—and welcomed
our guest ministers to campus—and
took them to—their rooms in the
dormitories. Jim: Mann ‘is the new
president of this group. Thanks, and
honors go to the boys who helped
take care of the Synod by waiting
tables during meals. Jim Pittman
and Sterling Edwards did a fine job
managing this large task.

Groups ,throughout the state are
going to have a conference Novem-

ber, 2-4—and Davidson is to be host
to this group. Don’t be surprised
when 40 pretty young’ ladies—and
20 young men—from the colleges in
this state invade campus, I know we
will: enjoy having this group with
us. Perhaps they can help us stop
Mr. Truman when he passes thro-
ugh town.

great treat in store. Fall Services.
This year we are going to have a
Campus Christian Mission — with

ing the Rétligioiws Emptiasis” Pro-

The various Hall Prayer Meeting
Leaders are to be commended on
their splendid job so far this year
with the Wednesday night devo-
tions, Make it a point to be in the
every Wednesday night at
10 P.. M.—and take an active part in
your Hall Meeting. Here's your real
chance to get other fellow’s ideas.
Here’s your chance to get to really
know the other boys on your halls.
And what's most important—here’s
your chance to meet with a congen-
ial group and praise God—and show
your appreciation to Him for the
privilege of being at Davidson, Ver-
non McGehee is in charge of all
Hall Prayer Meetings—let’s co-ope-
rate withhim—and let’s give this
tradition a big boost with your sup-
port this year. Copies of “The Upper
Room” will be distributed to each
student—these are excellent guides
for daily devotions. It’s very easy
to overlook and neglect the most im-
portant things in life which seem
to be very small—Your personal de-
votions, and realization of God's
presence js one of these import-
ant things. Don’t neglect your per-
sonal spiritual development.

The new cover on the Pool table
is still in good shape. The cue sticks
manage to lose tips every twenty
four hours—but thanks to “Pete”
Sinclair—new tips are replaced as
soon as old ones are lost.

Sunday School in the “Y!’ Lounge
has been well attended so far this
year. Thanks for taking an active
interest in this activity—We are
very grateful to Major Reichel, Pro-
fessor Fleagle. Professor Goldiere,
and George Gunn—who has brought
us fine messages the past-few Sun-
days. Praise and thanks go to Jack
Bagley and the boys who have been
journeying off to the Sanatorium
each Sunday to teach classes. Paul
Young has been teaching the Senior
Class in the College Church. At-
tention Freshmen—this is a mixed
class—and it is’a very interesting
one at that. Ask Jack Payne, Russell
Miller, or Henry Cathey.

MARTIN
(Continued from Page 1)

to several outstanding offices. First
he was elected as the S.M.C. of the
Pi Kappa Alpha social fraternity,
as a member of the student council,
and the Y.M.C.A. cabinet and as
the Freshman Advisor.

With a normal freshman enrol-
ment it is vital to have a competent
man for this office and we believe
that Martin is that man. He has
had varied experience, and leader-

ship, fellowship, and is a person of |

Mature judgement.

The duties of the Freshman Ad-
visor are many and varied. He is
responsible for calling the meetings
of the freshman class and acts in
the capacity of advisor for the gen-
eral welfare of that class. It is also
the duty of the Freshman Advisor
to prepare and give to the fresh-
man class a written test on the
provisions of the Davidson Student
Government Constitution, its By-
laws and the Freshman regulations.
This test is to be given before Oct-
ober 15.

We feel that Martin has already
shown excellent results and we are
expeoting to see even finer results
in the future.

TIMELY THOUGHTS

It is often profitable for a quick
thinker to be a slow speaker.

We can often discern wisdom in
men who listen much and say little

Human conduct of high standard
results benefically.

Man is something like a check,
value being the determing factor.

We grow in wisdom when we cor-
rect and do not repeat our errors.

Beware of extravagant spending
It may lead to a tragic ending.

_ The best time to distribute the

milk of human kindness is today.
Victories are never won without

courage and careful preparation.

We mount the pinnacle of fame
not by looking, but by climbing.

who attend it. If you would like to
see it in action—make a visit some
Sunday. Services begin 11 A. M. The
Church is located about a block the
other side of the Post office.

In closing I want to add that it is
certainly wonderful to be back at
Davidson this year. I’m here to be
your friend and to help you. Let’s
all begin now to be the Active
Christians that we want to be. “Life
Goes the Way Youth Finally
Takes.” Take the Christian Way.
