Music Review...

"Everything" You Always Wanted from a Great Band

By Rachel Newcomb

If you were lucky enough to
catch Everything’s incredible live
show atPIKA last month, you were
probably impressed with their
boundless energy and feverish vi-
tality. In my opinion, they are one
of the most talented bands I’ve
heard at Davidson in a long time.
Their new release, Play, which was
available for sale at their perfor-
mance, proves that Everything is
definitely a band to watch.

It is difficult to label
Everything’s musical style. At
times, their spirited enthusiasm is
reminiscent of the Spin Doctors,
only without the commercialism.
Their driving bass grooves could
be compared to the hedonistic funk
of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. But
for the most part, they overstep
comparison for a unique style all
their own.

Play begins with a harmoni-
ous anthem to the Earth, “Peace
Dance.” The forceful percussion
groundwork is topped with horn-
flecked melodies and a bit of syn-
‘ thesizer fora futuristic sound. This

is one of my favorite tracks. It
avoids being sappy and comes
across as a positive statement for
appreciating and respecting the
world’s gifts.

The next cut on the album is
the festive but cheesy “South of
the Border.” This song is heavy on
the hornsand utilizes every clichéd
Mexican sound possible. Words
like “calypso” and “pina colada”
pop outat youon first listen. How-
ever, a Closer look at the lyrics
reveals that Everything is trying to
say that behind Mexico’s rampant
tourism lies an extremely poor and
impoverished nation.

Not all of Play is a political
statement, however. “S.L.W.B.”
(which stands for “skinny little
white butt”) is another hilarious
cut that attempts to make no heavy-
handed statements whatsoever.
The funky James Brown guitar
sound is perfectly complimented
by just the right amount of horns.
“Who Do You Love” is a pretty
good track thatreminds meof Blues
Traveler’s ‘“Déwn in the Groove.”

Some of the songs I don’tlike

. off the ground.

at all. “Grind,” which begins with
what sounds like chanting monks,
is a song which never seems to get
“I’m Alive” is
another fairly unoriginal track.
Sometimes Everything seems to
go overboard on their usage of
horns. Using samples from “Pink
Panther” and the “James Bond
Theme," “Spies” doesn’t seem to
have much of their characteristic
energy, but is not a bad tune.

But by far, the cut that has
spent the most time on my tum-
table is the amazing “Soul Fish.”
This song best captures
Everything’s distinct, playful live
sound. Describing astylish, swing-
ing fish with “a leisure suit, some
gold medallions, you ain’t gonna
stop this fishy stallion.” “Soul
Fish” is filled with pounding bass
and aquatic noises. The lyrics are
clever and simple, and the many
different drums make this an ex-
tremely danceable song. The end
is punctuated with a rousing howl
of “Soooouul” sung in the style of
the television show Soul Train.

Everything isa fairly new band

and the Play CD has a lot of rough
edges. However, it shows that the
group has a great deal of raw talent

and some of the songs are very

good. When they played at PiKA
I was astounded with the incred-
ible amount of energy they have.
They seemed like a band that had
its act together and looked like
they have a great time singing and

singer did offhandedly tell the

Davidson audience, “I see a lot of -
J.Crew out there,” they had a good
rapport with the crowd. Unfortu-
nately, one of their best songs,
“Junkyard Jam” isn't on Play, but
the album is definitely worth get-
ting ahold of. Write Everything,
