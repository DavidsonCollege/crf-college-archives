Hobo in a mink?

Wrestling has large.
outfit but small team

By DAVID COARSEY

The Davidson wrestling
team is at it again this season.
This year, however, marks the
beginning of a new era. The
opening of the Baker Sports
Complex gives the wresting
team new facilities and equip-
ment provided by a generous
donation from Lowel Bryon.

The new wrestling room is
comparable to that of any in the
country, even rivaling those of
the traditional wrestling
strongholds such as Iowa and
Arizona. The equipment dem-
onstrates a financial shot in the
arm which bolsters Davidson’s
status. In short, the Davidson
wrestling team looks good.

However, it lacks one key in-
gredient: wrestlers. Six weeks
into the season, the team still
only consists of eight members.
It takes 13 to fillateam. —

Insufficient recruiting is
partly toblame for the shortage
of wrestlers. This year, five
freshmen went out for the
team, none of which were
seriously recruited.

Three have already quit, ob-
viously leaving an inadequate
number to support the team in
the future. There is a serious

lack of advertisement for the
program. The facilities along
with the excellence of the col-
lege should help to draw some
serious wrestlers.

However, no one knows of
the program’s existence.
Davidson’s recruiting policies
are simply inadequate, and in-
comparable to those of compa-
rable schools such as Washing-
ton and Lee, FurmanandGeor-
gia Tech.

Asa highschool senior, I was
totally unaware that Davidson
had a_ wrestling team until
during a phone conversation
with Georgia Tech’s wrestling
coach. He happened to men-
tion that Davidson was on his
schedule.

It is somewhat ridiculous
and very unfortunate that the
priorities of the athletic de-
partment lie firstin making the
wrestling team look good, and
only secondly in recruiting
more quality wrestlers.

It might be helpful to use’

some of the money allocated to
the team for scholarships in
order toattract more high qual-
ity wrestlers to fill the uni-
forms and the wrestling room.

Asof now the wrestling team

Mark Puckett is unmercifully pinned under Henry Neil during wrestling practice.

as a whole can be compared to
a hobo in a mink. This is not
meant to say we do not have
good wrestlers, but that we
have so few of them.

Fortunately, although few in
numbers, Davidson has some
good wrestlers. Much needed
experience is given to the team
by juniors Joe Binns and Eric
Farmer and sophomore Chris
Clark.

So far this season the team
has competed in one tourna-

ment, the Greensboro Open.
Both Chris and Joe were out-
standing, each taking third
place. Their records are a
strong 4-1 so far this season.

So what does the season hold
for the Wildcats? Due to the
fact that every time we have a
dual meet (when only two
teams compete against each
other) we must forfeit five
weight classes, it is highly un-
likely that we will have a suc-
cessful team record.

However, onthe tournament
level, where forfeits do not
count directly against you, we
should do fairly well.

The few wrestlers we have
can win. But injury poses a big
danger because the team will
need every member.

As for the future, the athletic
department needs to realize
that glitter and glamour are
great, but only suiting half of a
wrestling team does little to
enhance our prestige.

Volleyball beats Queens, falls to
: UNCG

The Wildcats volleyball team finished
its 1989 season last week with a pair of
away matches, The team defeated
Queens College, 15-5, 15-11, 15-10, and
later lost to UNC-Greensboroina tough
match, 15-11, 6-15, 7-15, 7-15.

“Queens isa muchimproved team, so
it was nice to be able to beat them in
three games and be able to have every-
one on the team play,” said freshman
Janet Delery. Delery played well on
defense and had a good passing game.
“Janet is coming along as an effective
hitter and should contribute greatly to
next year’s team,” said coach Rebecca
Hawkins.Sophomore Catherine Robb
had her best game of the season and
collected five kills as well as several
point-saving digs.

The ‘Cats began the last match of the
season against Greensboro playing
very well, winning the first game 15-11.
“We took advantage of their slow start,
and we played well defensively, but we
didn’t have the attack ability that they
had,” said Hawkins.

The team finished the season with a
final record of 12-20 against tougher
competition than last season. “We kept
improving throughout the season and
you only get better, in any sport, by
playing better teams. We'll be older and
wiser next year,” said Hawkins.

Wildcat injury report

Stress fracture puts Gray
out for 6-8 weeks .

By CARTER PAYNE

The Davidson basketball team has
already been hit witha staggering blow.
Two weeks ago, senior forward and
sure starter Maurice Gray fractured the
fifth metatarsal bone in his right foot.
The injury was immediately diagnosed
asa stress fracture, and Gray was placed
in a cast for eight weeks.

Gray hopes to start rehabilitation in
mid-January and to return to action by
early February in time for the final third
of the season.

Gray described the cause of the injury
as simply “something that happened
over a period of time.” The continuous,

rigorous pounding which his foot took -
eventually resulted in a break. It was
“one of those inevitable things,” re-
marked Gray.

Inevitable perhaps, but tremen-

dously unfortunate for the basketball
team. In Gray the Wildcats lose a pow-
erful force inside, who last year pro-
duced 9.3 points and 4.2 rebounds a
game.
But perhaps worst of all, they lose an
element of senior leadership for which
the other seniors will have to compen-
Sate.

Inthe meantime we wishGray arapid
recovery.
