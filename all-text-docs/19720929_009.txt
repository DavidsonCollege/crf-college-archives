Cats Take On Falcon Giants

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

Davidson is presently known
as the smallest school in the
country playing major college
football, and tomorrow they will
make an effort at being giant-
killers.

After a shattering loss to
Lenoir Rhyne, the Cats are
travelling to Colorado Springs,
Colo. to tackle the Falcons of

a"

aan? * o*

Air Force, a major college
power.

The Falcons are unbeaten af-
ter two games, defeating
Wyoming and Pittsburg.

Davidson coach Dave Fagg
called Air Force ‘‘the best foot-
ball team Davidson has played
in the past 20 years.”

Fagg said the Falcons had a
balanced team, capable of
equal running. and passing

strength.

Force will rely on are Rich
Haynie, quarterback for the
Falcons, and running back Joel
Carson.

Haynie hit nine of 21 passes
against Pittsburg last Satur-
day, two for touchdowns. Fagg
called him ‘“‘one of the best
quarterbacks we'll see all
season.”’

Carson has had impressive
games against both Wyoming
and Pittsburg, rolling up over
100 yards rushing in each con-
test. He hit 134 in the Pitt game.

The team as a whole is large,
although they do not sacrifice
size for speed Fagg said.

The Falcon’s line con-
siderably outweighs the Cats on
both offense and defense,
although the teams are of fairly
equal size in the defensive
secondaries.

The Falcons use a *‘52”' defen-
se, with a five man front, two
linebackers and a rover.

Rover Steve Heil put in a fine
defensive performance against
Pittsburg, making nine solo
tackles and helping tackles and
helping on two others.

Steve Ogilvie, a defensive
end, is an all-American can-
didate.

Against Pittsburg, the
Falcons played slowly during
the first half, scoring 13 points
through two field goals in ghe
first quarter and a touchdown in
the second quarter.

They broke the game open in
the second half, however, with
four touchdowns in four drives.

“It looked like they were kind
of playing with Pitt,” Fagg
said.

The Davidson team that will
meet the Air Force tomorrow
has been hurt by injuries.

Quarterback Scooty Shipp
was knocked out of the Lenoir
Rhyne game with an injured
shoulder, and his return is still
questionable.

“He said he thinks he can
play,”’ Fagg said,’ but we can’t
be sure.”

In last week's game, John
Webel, one of the Cats’ key run-
ners, was knocked out of action
with an injured leg.

Defense Prevail

By DAVID MELTON

The Davidson Wildcat foot-
ball team suffered a blow to its
1972 campaign in a stunning up-
set at the hands of Lenoir
Rhyne, 41-16.

According to quarterback
Dave Harper, ‘‘We went out
there, and it just wasn’t our
night.”

Harper, filling in for injured
quarterback Scotty Shipp, ad-
ded, ‘‘We made some mistakes
early that got the defense in a
hole.’ It was a hole that the
Cats never climbed out of.

Down 41-0, the Cats made
somewhat of a comehack. Har-
per hit tight-end Bruce Becker
with a 28 yard scoring toss, and
he again found Becker in the
open for the two-point con-
version.

Dave Harper has stepped up
to fill in for Shipp at quar-
terback, and, as a sophomore,
may get a true baptism of fire
at the Air Force game.

‘Dave plays well, but he’s still
young,” Fagg said.

The Wildcats will be setting
several new records with the
game at Air Force. This is the
farthest they have ever
travelled to play a game, and
only the second time they have
crossed the Missippi.

The Falcons are_ also
probably the best team overall
the Cats have faced since the
Tangerine Bow! in 1970.

‘‘We see the Air Force game
as a real challenge,”’ Fagg said.
‘‘We like that.”

Harper stated that the Lenior
Rhyne defense was ‘‘keying a
lot on Davis and Walker, so we
started throwing to the tight-
end,”’ which was Becker.

Harper then complimented
Becker’s play by saying ‘‘He’s
got great hands and he did a
fine job catching the ball.”

During that drive, Harper hit
freshman Jeff Heinicka with a
beautifully executed screen
pass. Heinicka took the pass,
and using his blockers well,
scooted down the sidelines.

He was caugght, however, by
a Lenoir defensive back just as
he reached the Lenoir Rhyne 15
yard line. Harper then com-
pleted the scoring drive with the
touchdown pass to Davis.

Following a successful onside
kick, Harper again rallied the
team for a score. This time he
hit split-end Andy Davis with a
five yard touchdown pass to end
a 50 yard drive.

Davis also caught a pass for
the two point conversion.

Injuries also are now
plaguing the Wildcats. Running
back John Webel sustained an
injured ankle while quar-
terback Scotty Shipp, defensive
end Jimmy Hardison, and run-
ning backs Alton McAllum and
Dave Ingold were sidelined.

Davidson's passing attack
was somewhat of a plus. Harper
passed for a total of 274 yards,
but the Cats lost three fumbles
and had two passes intercepted
by the Bears.

The Lenoir Rhyne offense
was in control of the game most
of the way. Larry Black, the
Bear's quarterback anda trans-
fer from Florida State, un-
veiled his passing arm for the
first time at Lenior Rhyne, and
kept the Wildcat defense in
trouble all night.

Lenoir Rhyne also showed
great hustle and talent.

Harper reasoned that, ‘‘They
couldn't do anything wrong."

Raymond H. “Chip” Stone,
new head of the intramural
sports program, looks forward
to a better than 90 per cent par-
ticipation in intramural com-
petition for the '72-73 school
year.

Stone said he intends to add
squash, paddle ball, and team
handball to the program.

Stone added that at Chapel
Hill the participation in in-
tramurals was unusually high,
but was pleasantly surprised at
the even greater interest here

- at Davidson. He was especially

impressed with the popularity
of flickerball.

Stone replaces Sterling Mar-
tin who will now devote full time
to coaching track. and cross
country.

While at UNC-Chapel Hill,
Stone won varsity letters in
football, soccer, and baseball.

Stone said he now has no in-
terest in coaching a varsity

sport, but does see the need to
keep the IMAC a growing
program.

He will also take over Mar-
tin’s position as head of the

physical education program.
