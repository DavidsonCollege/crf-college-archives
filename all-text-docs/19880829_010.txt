Gatto looks to 1988 football
season with “cautious optimism’’

By BRUCE NEWSOME

Davidson football coach Vic
Gatto opens the 1988 season with
cautious optimism. With this
year’s freshman class, Gatto has
three full recruiting classes to
work with. Another reason for
this optimism is an easier sched-
ule than in the past three years.
Gone from last year’s schedule
are Princeton, Wingate, Furman,
West Virginia Tech, and
Catawba. Replacing them are
Fordham, Guilford, Colgate, and
East Tennessee State.

Gatto also saw some positives
in the ’Cats last two games of the
1987 season. The team only lost
to West Virginia Tech 41-25, and
a late Catawba touchdown and
only a two point conversion cost
the Cats a second victory in the
1987 season.

Experience is another positive
for Davidson. Many of this year’s
juniors and sophomores saw sig-
nificant action last year.

Although they were . often
matched against older ard bigger
players, previous game experi-
ence should help as Davidson’s
returning starters and lettermen
line up against first year starters
from other schools.

As a result of the large number
of returning starters, current
freshmen will not be counted on
to play significant roles this year

¢ who transferred.

as the last two freshman classes
have. However, Gatto does see
some freshmen who are ready to,
play immediately.

They are Carrick Pell, acorner-
back from Florida who is the son
of former Florida and Clemson
coach Charlie Pell, Horace
Hamm a wide receiver from Flor-
ida, and Calvin Hobbs an offen-
sive lineman from North Caro-
lina. Gatto also feels that other
freshmen such as Ken Joseph will
be able to contribute by mid-sea-
son.

However, Gatto also sees some
areas of concern for the ’Cats. He
is worried about the promising
players that are not back from last
year’s squad, the team’s lack of
depth, and the emotional level of
a team that has only won two
games in the. last three seasons.

Pre-season injuries .and trans-
fers have taken away some of the
’Cats best players. Knee injuries
have ended their seasons before
they began for last year’s fresh-
man running back Bryn Robinson
and senior starting cornerback
Steve Neff.

Both Robinson and Neff tore
their knees up in non-contact
drills in the spring.

Also gone from last year’s team
is quarterback Mark Skoczynski,

Depth is also a problem for the

*Cats. Right now Gatto only has
65 relatively healthy players.
Consequently, ‘the Cats cannot
sustain many more injuries; oth-_
erwise, freshmen will have to play
before they are ready.

Finally, Gatto feels the team
needs to learn how to win. The
team had two close games to end
the season last year, and this
year’s squad needs to turn the
close games into victories. In
order to keep.a positive attitude,
Gatto believes the team needs to
win one of the first two games
against Presbyterian and Lehigh.
These teams are two of the
tougher teams on the schedule, so
the ’Cats have their work cut out
for them.

In order to win one of these two
games, the team will need big
games from its offensive and de-
fensive leaders. On offense the
key will be the middle of center
Gat Caperton, quarterback Peter
Hughes, and tailback Terry
Hines:

On defense, tackles Mike Ro-
gers and Kenny Nazemetz, end
David Lilly, and linebacker Tony
Hubbard will provide leadership.

In general, Gatto feels that this
team should do better than his
previous teams, but he says 1989
is the year that Davidson should
be set to make its move in the
Colonial League.

These are the times that try men’s souls

By HAP BRYANT

‘*These are the times that try
men’s souls’’--wrote Thomas
Paine during the darker days of
the American Revolution. We
can say the same today about the
state of Davidson athletics, as our
will is tested by many outside
factors.

What is the state of Davidson
athletics? That question con-
fronts everyone associated with
the school, from the two-week-
old freshman to thé oldest
Davidson alumni.

In investigating where
Davidson stands as an institution
committed to both academics and
athletics, itis necessary to explore
the entire spectrum of people who
are concerned with athletic issues
at the college. ‘‘Around the
Horn’’ has accepted this charge
and will do its best to air all views
on the subject, hopefully leaving
no voice unheard.

First, a logic dictates that we
start with the top man at the
' school, President John Kuyken-
dall, who oversees both the aca-
demic and athletic life of the col-
lege, Naturally, he has one of the
final words on athletic policy, and
he provides valuable insight into
the ongoing changes facing the
institution.

The second person whose Gpin:

Morris. His stance is vitally im-
portant because he oversees all
athletic programs and reports to
the President and Trustees on
athletic matters. ‘

The hierarchy divides here
among the coaches of Davidson
sports teams. Their views will

. certainly not be identical, as foot-

ball coach Vic Gatto and soccer
coach Charlie Slagle must differ
on anumber of issues facing their
programs today.

Fourthly, the players them-
selves can give us a first-hand
view of the state of Davidson
athletics. Like their coaches, the
athletes participating in different
sports must possess different
opinions. After all, a football
player must look at the situation
quite differently than does a
women’s tennis player. How-
ever; we must value everyone’s
opinion if we are to get at the heart
of the issues.

In addition, interesting insight
also comes from the students of
the college, every one of which, in
one way or another, is connected
with the athletic program. All
students take pride in victories
and regret defeats, and they also
must be considered when investi-
gating opinions on Davidson ath-

‘ letics.

ion we must consider is Athletic :
Director Christopher B. ‘‘Kit’’

Then there are the behind-the-
scenes workers, the Trustees, who
“‘objectively’’ observe the occur-

‘Must approve any change in

rences at Davidson and ultimately
decide policy. Although they are
visible on campus only on rare
occasions, their opinions are per-
haps the most valuable since they
letic or academic lic
Davidson.

So, we have exposed many
facets of the Davidson commu-
nity who possess opinions on ath-
letic programs. But what issues
confront and mold these opinions
in the fall of 1988?

First, and perhaps most obvi-
ous, is the new independent status
for all sports except football and
field hockey. The football pro-
gram enters its second season in
the Colonial League, a Division I
association comprised of mainly

norilieastemn schools. The field
hockey program remains in the
Big South Conference. Basket-
ball, soccer, tennis, golf, baseball,
cross country and track--all these
sports have no conference affili-
ation. What does this mean for
Davidson as an institution, for the
programs in particular, and for
athletes who compete on newly-,
independent teams? Will Alan
Hunter be satisfied playing
Campbell University when he
could have played Marshall?
Asecond issue is the new sports

‘complex. Presently, it is an eye-

sore behind Richardson Field, but
itcould emergeasa valuable asset
to the basketball program in par-
ticular and Davidson athletics in
general. Will the enticement of

the new facility, compensate for
the lack of conference affiliation,
especially for the basketball pro-
gram? Coach Bobby Hussey
must certainly have an opinion on
this matter.

Thirdly, the academic vs. ath-
letic dialectic that is constantly
occurring at Davidson gives us
yet another vital issue. Is there a.
disparity between athletes and
other students, or doathletes carry
their load like everyone else?

This is certainly a large task for
a weekly student newspaper col-
umn. But ‘‘Around the Horn’’
owes: it to the whole Davidson
community to air as many, views
as possible, and in the process
hopefully to better the state of
Davidson athletics.

Lady Cats look for improvement

By LARRY DAGENHART, JR.

The Davidson field hockey team, rebounding
from a 3-8-2 season last year, hopes to improve
under third-year head coach Betsy Pryor.

Despite the loss of last year’s leaders, Betsy
Rothschild, Mandy Barret, and Janet Bitter, the
Wildcats will be stronger thanks to the return of —
co-captains Eileen Keeley and Alison Chapman, :
who will be relied on heavily at the fullback and

junior years abroad. Montgomery should be im-
: proved after having played with several ‘Zeb
teams in Scotland.
Other top returnees for Davidson include j junior
fullback Marta Bukowski, sophomores Marjorie
_ Havighurst and Gigi Cooke, who led the team in
scoring last year with eight goals.
If anything has improved for Davidson in field
hockey, it is certainly the recruits who have
