Class of 2001 arrives

Largest and most diverse group ever

ANN CuLp
Staff Writer

This is Dean of Admission and
Financial Aid Nancy Cable’s fa-
vorite time of the year.

After reviewing 3,183 applica-
tions, selecting 1,153 potential
Davidsonians, and distributing fi-
nancial assistance, the Admissions
and Financial Aid staff can finally
see the 472 students of the Class of
2001 arrive on campus. =

From the largest number of
applicants in Davidson’s history,
242 men and 230 women from 38
different states and 16 foreign coun-
tries enrolled as freshmen.

Seven hundred-hoursot volun-

teer work, alawn-mowing business,

that has yielded $21,800, and study
ofan ancient Indian martial art called
Kalari Payat are just a few accom-
plishments of individual students.
The Class of 2001 seems to have
more students dedicated to one ac-
tivity as opposed to numerous-com-
mitments than previous classes had,

particularly in the case of volun-

teering. These new students are
academically strong, with 95: per-
cent coming from the top 20 per-
cent. of their high school and 19
percent graduating as valedictorian
or salutatorian.

However, the Class of 2001 is is
also one of the most diverse, with
30 African Americans, one His-
panic American, and. 22 interna-
tional students attending pre-orien-

tation. These numbers are the cul- -

mination of a five-year effort to

New students share thoughts, hopes, fears

By JessicA GOODSON
News Editor

The second day of Orientation
began bright and early Thursday as
Union staff members herded fresh-
men through New Student Check-

With social security numbers
and checkbooks in hand, hundreds
of bewildered freshman secured
their BTI cards, student IDs, and a

_ chance to dona hula hoop and som-
brero for the camera.

Many freshman had only been
at Davidson two short hours, but

were willing to share first impres-
sions.

“Everything seems well
planned. and it’s all running
smoothly,” said Kelly Byrd of Thou-
sand: Oaks, Calif. “Everyone has
been very nice.”

Overall, most new students felt
reassured by the personal attention
and cordial welcome they received
from Davidson staff and students.

Kurt Hirsekorn of Moorestown,
N.J., echoed this sentiment, noting
that the “friendly atmosphere of the
South has been comforting” in the
face of freshman anxieties.”

Hirsekorn, who swims and
plays golf, came to Davidson be-
cause “it offers the best combina-
tion of acedemics and sports.”

Katherine Miller of Upper St.
Claire, Pa., also found Davidson’s

Division I status attractive in mak-
ing the final decision to attend.

Two concerns, though, hinged
on the dorm issue.

“My greatest fear is that] won’t
be able to fit everything into my
room,” said Stephanie Kohler of
Atlanta.

David Farnum of Roanoke, Va.,
named his greatest anxiety simply
as “Richardson dorm.” Soliciting a
swap of rooms, he mentioned that
he was willing “to give sexual fa-
vors..

“No, really, my real fear is.look-
ing like a freshman. Wide-eyed,
clingy, wide-eyed.”

Farnum cited his reception to
the Bonner Scholar program as a
welcome which “lessened the im-
pact” of these potentially over-
whelming first days of school and

the realization that the furniture in
his room is immobile.

Some freshmen, such as
Michael Brady of Tampa, Fla.,
found it “liberating “ to wave
goodbye to parents and life athome.

“I have older friends who've
prepared me for what to expect,” he
said.

In fact, many newcomers re-
ceived warnings from older siblings
and Davidson graduates of a “rude
awakening” forthcoming.

Other students, however, wor-
ried about maintaining friendships

and relationships from home while

they are away at school. David
Kang of West Plains, Mo., observes
that “starting over is a bittersweet
experience.” :

Not only is it hard to leave old
friends behind, but many freshmen

share apprehensions about making
new friends, particularly among
roommates. Rebecca Rich, for ex-
ample, had not yet met her room-
mate as of registration.

“T worry about living with
someone else,” she said. Amidst
check-in confusion, “I’ve already
misspelled my name and I'sounded |
illiterate saying those mad libs over
the radio.”
