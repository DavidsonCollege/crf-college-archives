Defense the cause of season’s downturn

By STOKES PEEPLES
Staff Writer

Davidson’s season ending
doubleheader against Furman
was indicative of the “‘up and
down” way the Wildcats had
played all season. The Cats split
with the Paladins (winning 12-8
in the first game while losing
8-0 in-the second) to complete
the season with an overall
record of 15-24. The double-
header also gave the Cats a 7-8
conference record and placed
them close to the middle_of the
Southern Conference standings.

In the first game against
Furman, Davidson had 18 hits,
an extremely high number con-
sidering the game lasted only
seven innings. Marc Webster
had four hits: while Cam Zur-

bruegg went two for four and
had three runs batted in. Diggs
Bishop started the game but
Rusty Colechia came in on relief
to pick up the victory. In the
second game Davidson suffered
both a hitting and fielding lapse
and lost 8-0.

The Cats’ midseason collapse
surprised almost everyone. Af-
ter 23 games Davidson was
12-11 and leading the Con-
ference; however, several fac-
tors contributed to the dismal
second half finish. Junior Cap-
tain Cam Zurbruegg said, “‘Ba-
sically it was the defense that
let us down, especially the
infield play. Over our last 13
games we averaged over 10 hits
a game so the hitting wasn’t
really a big problem.’’ Zur-

bruegg commented that the
Furman games were indicative
of the season in that in the first
game Davidson played sound
offensive baseball and the few
errors that occurred did not
make much difference. But in
the second game, offensive and
defense both fell apart for the
Cats.

Even though the Wildcats
finished poorly there were
strong individual efforts that
helped the team. John Porter
led the team in hitting again
with a .383 average and made a
strong bid to repeat as an
All-Conference selection. John
Haskell hit eight homeruns and
had a .c51 average while doing
an excellent job of fielding in
right field. John Marshall and
Allen Griffin had .331 and.316
averages respectively and Grif-
fin set a new Davidson doubles
record.

Rusty Colechia ended up the
only winning pitcher on the
staff with a 4-3 record and
played well the second half of
the season to post an excellent
2.89 earned run average. Jon
Young and Diggs Bishop were
the other top pitchers.

Next year does indeed look
bright. Much has been made
about the fact that there were
no seniors'on this year’s squad
and it looks like everyone will be
back. In addition the Wildcats
are recruiting a top high school
left-handed pitcher from Virgin-
ia who has narrowed his college
choices to William and’ Mary
and Davidson. With a strong
recruiting year the Wildcats
would have the potential for a
strong season next year.

Bonehead bites the dust ist

By BONEHEAD and
THE BRICK BROTHERS
Consider, fair students, for

you are witnessing the: first
major event of the decade.

- Bonehead is retiring. This is the

last public document ‘to be
recorded with his pen. And now
for ““A Tribute to Bonehead,
written by the one who admires
him the most and the one who
can say it better than anyone
else. Enter Bonehead:

The legend began in the early
hours of the morning (when you
cannot decide whether to go
take one in the bathroom or
stay in bed and let your back
teeth float) when. a young lad
was innocently finishing his
seventeenth Red, White, and
Blue on the front steps of the
laundry. Up strolled a tall lanky
unit by the name of “‘Bad
Bernard”’ who was accompanied
by. his Queenie girlfriend. Bad
Bernie took interest in the
disillusioned young child but
decided to pass him by in favor
of attempting to return to the
sack with his ugly mate. Thus
began a long friendship between
Bad Bernard and the young lad,
Bonehead.

In time, the enchanted
friendship became strained. The
pressures of drinking every
night and attending classes
daily began to warp the person-
alities of the two comrades. To
remedy the situation they de-
cided to forgo‘their classes. At
about this same time they were
approached by a nerd who said
that he was the editor of the
student newspaper call The
Davidsonian. The nerd said
that he was in desparate need of
two expert sportswriters. Bone-
head remarked that he once
knew somebody who knew an
athlete and with this comment
the duo was hired for fifty
dollars a week to inform the
students about intramural
sports. Thus was born the
article ‘‘By Bad Bernard and
Bonehead.”’

Now Bad Bernard and Bone-
head were not your ordinary
IMAC writers. They felt that in
order for one to understand
IMAC sports one must have a
background of the activities of
the athletes (and non-athletes).
Often times they would write
hundred page essays only to
discover that the newspaper

people had edited most of the

comments. Bad Bernie and
but they continued to write
against all that was evil. They
criticized women, freshmen and
SPEs with wreckless abandon.

Hard ass professors could not

escape the wrath of their pen.

The masses loved them and Bad |

Bernard and Bonehead loved
the masses in return:

One day Bad Bernard said to
Bonehead, ‘‘Bonehead, ‘I’m
gonna fly this chicken coup. a
And he was gone. Thus Bone-
head, upon becoming” indepen-
defit, was forced to enter than.
hood. :

Bonehead found’ that it was"
definitely lonely at the top. He
said to himself, ‘‘Bonehead, it is”
definitely lonely at the top.” So
Bonehead went in search of the
Brick Brothers and found them
smoking hash on the front steps
of the laundry. He passed them
by but later returned to achieve
a homeostatic.-high. In time,’
Bonehead realized that the
Brick Brothers were the perfect
replacement for his historical
friend Bernard.

Now the Brick Brothers were
of a somewhat different nature
than Bad Bernard. They en-

-_joyed-words such as peripatetic

and peripatetic. They worship-
ped various students suchas
Merten and attacked an old
lady named Nelson. They exhi-
bited. a total lack of regard for
the fabulous intramural sports
activities that were occuring on
the campus. All of ag pleased
Bonehead.

But today Rondlieed suffers
from osteocraniutitis and thus
he is forced to park his pen and
ascend to a purely physical life.
He is the all-time great IMAC
writer. A Davidson legend to be
remembered along with such
greats as Peter Stuart Ney,
John Gerdy, Woodrow Wilson,
and Butch the dog. And just
remember that you attended
Davidson during the reign of
Bonehead. Now get out of here
you little booger pickers!

Now for the news. The scores
are coming into our new B&BB
Sports Hotline. Games after
Monday will not be reported so
if you do not see your score then
go sit on a bunsen burner. In
men’s softball, Bone and the
Wankers advanced to the finals
of the winner’s bracket after
Bone cruised past B.F. Deal
11-7 and the Wankers recorded
a victory over the War Kiwis
followed by a 5-4 squeaker over
La Casa.

In the men’s volleyball tour-
nament, four teams advanced to
the semifinals. Listed in alpha-
betical order they were Net
Result, Airborne, Slaughter-
house 6, and the Penal Strikes.
Look for the team with the

’ babyfaced professor (Krentz) to

take the championship.

In coed volleyball, Ewes
Guys narrowly lost, to Davidson
Power and Light Company.

The women’s volleyball
championship was taken by
Psyched to Spike who beat out
the K-O-las as the Buzzer
sounded. The girls of Second
Richardson were runners-up for

~ the. third ovale ‘time this

year.

Tn the woelaitateitbill tour:
ney there was one team that
showed up for every game and

therefore captured the cham-

for your generous support!
