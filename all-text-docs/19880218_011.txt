Player profiles

More sophomores and freshmen

By BILL SMITH
Sophomores have played a cru-
cialrole in the successof the Wild-
cats this year, and with the depar-
ture of star seniors such as Derek
Rucker and Jeff Himes, they will

be faces to watch; they will prove.

even more important next season.
One of the starting sophomores,

- who started most of last year and

earned a spot on the Conference
freshmen team, is 6-8, 220-pound
center Jay Schmitt. According to
Hussey, Schmitt is the type who
gives everything and often too
much; he is “a pleasure to coach.”

The main strength in Schmitt’s
game is his defense--a product of
his effort; he is Davidson’s best
inside defender. An additional
strength is the soundness of
Schmitt’s basketball fundamen-
tals which enables him to respond
to demands placed on him.

The areas that Hussey hopes to
see Schmittimprove this season as
he gains more valuable playing
time are his confidence in scoring,
his strength and jumping ability,
and his quickness.

As Schmitt improves, so will
the potential threat of Davidson’s
inside offense which currently
relies a great deal on the devel-
oped talents of senior Himes.

Residing patiently on the bench
this year with occasional opportu-
nities to play is Jeff Harris. We as
fans do not directly see the role

. that Harris, as well as other less-

experienced players, maintains in

the basketball program.

Part of Davidson’s success must
be attributed to how well these
players push the starters in prac-
tice. As they, Harris and others,
get better and play harder in prac-
tice, the starters improve.

In his second season, Harris
realizes that he is one of Hussey’s
“students” as he must continue to
learn the fundamentals and the
scheme of Davidson basketball.

Hussey noted that Harris is
“making nice progress” and that
he has “come along way” since he
arrived on campus. According to
Harris, basketball is a business
and he must work hard to learn the
post position and “pick up the
tricks of the trade from the sen-
iors.”

Since Maurice “Mo” Gray is
also a sophomore, he shares the
common goal with the other five
of gaining more experience this
season under the leadership of
Rucker, Himes, and the three
other seniors.

Teammate and roommate Alan
Hunter agreed with Gray that
“they [the sophomores] must
grow up faster this season and use
this year as a tune-up for the two
years to follow.”

“Mo’s strength is, well, his
Strength,” indicated Hussey.
Also, Gray has proven his defen-
sive ability as he has progressed
through the season, and he has

shownhisoffensive potency in the -

games such as Princeton, and at

VMI.

Gray enjoys his best games when
he play? well both from the pe-
rimeter and on the inside. His
versatility as a small forward can
throw the opponents off balance in
the their defense.

To be more of a threat, Gray

believes that he must practice
more on his individual skills and
his consistency.

Unfortunately, Thomas Hel-
land, a 6-9 230-pound forward/

center who was emerging as a .

player, has been redshirted this

season. This does mean, however,

that Helland will still have four
years eligibility with the

Davidson team. Hussey will ap-

preciate getting Helland back due
to his size and perimeter touch.
Turner Gilmore, a 6-3 180-

pound guard, is “one of the better

passers on this team” according to
Hussey. Gilmore will contribute
more directly in future seasons as
he gains more experience with the
Davidson system and his jump
shot and intensity level become
more consistent.

Due to his good practices this
year, Darry Strickland has played
in several games. Hussey has been
pleased with his capability for
team leadership which increases

his ability as a point guard. Inthe .

next three years, Strickland
‘should be strong asset to the team
as a guard with his size, 6-3 190-
pounds, and increased concentra-
tion in defense.
