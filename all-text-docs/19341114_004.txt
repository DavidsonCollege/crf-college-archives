Davidson has won only two games
on the gridiron this fall, but her sup-
porters have left the stands after every
contest highly satisfied with the way the
Wildcats performed. This was true
after Duke took the long end of a 20-0
score in the Richardson Field battle of a
few weeks ago and again Saturday when
the North Carolina eleven squeezed out
a 12-2 victory over the ‘Cats. The
Newton-McEver machine has had
tough row to hoe since September 29th,
but I've heard no complaint from any
side about the record they have made.

Those who have seen the Pres:
byterians play this season will
agree that no opponent has
fought as courageously and per-

ly as Davidson, and despit
their several defeats they have
proved themselves worthy to rep-
resent any college the size of

Davidson.

Coach Carl Snavely remarked after
the game Saturday that the ‘Wildcats
weren't the best team he had met this
year, but they were the hardest fight-
ing opposition his boys had encountered.

Mr. Joe Johnston kindled the
Wildcat spirit for the Tar Heel
engagement by his pep-inspiring
talk at Friday night’s Shearer Hall
gathering. This, genial president
of the Alumni Association was
one of the pioneer grid warriors
at Davidson, ‘playing center back
in the days. when the game
wasn’t so polite as it is now. He
very cleverly analyzed the David-
son team by choosing Wildcat
Potter to look after Carolina’s
(Bar)clay, Davidson’s Fort was
pointed out as a place of refuge,
and he reminded Wildcat support-
ers that he had never seen a
Mackorell canned.

Just as the words on a gold football
that adorns the alumni head’s watch
chain say he is “a real Wildcat,” which
not proved simply by the spirited
speech he made Friday, but also is it
manifested by a continual flow of foot-
ball talent that has come to Davidson
from Barium Springs as a result of Mr.
Johnston's influence. “Hey! Johnston,
here's a great big hand.”

Dick Piper, sports editor of The
Duke (University) Chronicle
writes a very interesting column
in his school paper, and in the

" issue of Nov. 6, he makes the fol-

lowing statement about future

schedules for Duke grid aggrega-
tions:

a

is

“Everyone, from dean to student,
agrees with us that Duke has little to
gain and everything to lose when our
elevens play Davidson or Wake Forest.
It is true that those schools would rath-
er defeat Duke than win every other
game on their schedule. Davidson was
soundly beaten by Army, 41 to 0, and
returned to Carolina to prime for us
by holding open the Saturday we played
Tech, resting’ and devising ways to up-
set us. Yet when we defeated them
20 to 0 we got no-more-than-a~bad in-
jury to our outstanding linesman, and
a hard game with no recognition.”

He went on to say that it was
only fair to the members of the

Duke team for the athletic direc-

tors and Coach Wade to. drop

* these two Big Five teams from

the schedule and arrange games

with more formidable opponents,
which would give the Blue Devils
something worth working for.

We at Davidson very readily recog-
nize the irrevocable superiority of Duke
teams to those representing the Red and
Black, but I’m afraid Mr. Piper was
“blowing-off” a trifle when he wrote that

“+ Clause about Davidson being willing to
sacrifice victory in all of her other
games in order to lick the Dukes. It
would be much nicer for the Wildcats to
defeat either Carolina or Wake Forest
once than to win three or four engage-
ments from the lads from Durham.

Someone remarked after the
game Saturday, that the pants of

WILDCATS WILL
FACE V. M1. ON
LOGAL GRIDIRON

Cadet Eleven Will Invade David-
son To Continue Traditional

Struggle
VISITORS ARE STRONG

Have Broken Even In Former Re-
lations; Eight Wins Each

The Davidson Wildcat eleven will meet
V. M. I. on Richardson field at 2:30 next
Saturday afternoon, Nov. 17, in its last
game before Thanksgiving.

This game will feature two strong but
much-defeated elevens in a 30-year-old
rivalry, V. M. I. has only chalked up one
victory this season and has been de-
feated six times, but they have fought
close games each time against strong
opposition. The Cadets scored against
Navy and defeated William and Mary
by a 13-6 gount. V. M. I. has “un-
questionably the strongest team in re-
cent years,” says Captain Pritchett. “A
heavy, powerful, and experienced eleven
that will require the Wildcats to use all
their power to win.” The Cadets have
a strong line and a “highly-polished”
running attack. Their star backfield men
are: Meredith Urick, Wayt Clark, and
Bo MeMillin, three fine ball carriers;
and Tucker Watkins, an equally good
blocking back.

Davidson will have the advantage of
a week's rest while the Cadets met Mary-
land at Baltimore in an Armistice Day
game last Monday. The invading eleven
will arrive Friday afternoon, probably
in time for a workout.

A special ticket price to alumni and
their families has been made for this
game. All Davidson graduates: may ob-
tain tickets at a reduced price if they
make reservations before the tickets go
on sale.

Davidson has played V. M. I. sixteen
times since 1904. The results so far are
unusual, there being exactly eight vic-
tories for each team. The teams have
never played a tie game and yet there
has rarely been more than a one touch-
down victory either way. Davidson has
won for the last three years.

Davidson Halfback Expects
Team To Win Both
Games

“I believe that the football squad will
work harder than ever for victories in
their last two games,” said Joe “Boody”
Wingfield when interviewed this week.
“If the present spirit is kept up, we
should be able to win both games, In
general, I think the chances on both
games are about equal.” |

Wingfield is in a position to tell about
the chances of his team. Since coming
to. Davidson from Reidsville Wingfield
has been a member of the famous Mack-
orell - Wingfield - Hutchins triumvirate
which has been the means of bringing
in many victories for the Wildcats. He
is known as the hardest working man
on the squad, and the results of his ap-
plication have shown up in his outstand-
ing blocking, running, and passing.

As Wingfield sees it, the chief trouble
with the Wildcats lately has been an in-
consistent offense. The defense against
much heavier teams has been excellent,
but a good amount of work will have
to be done on the offense before the
team will be in shape to win from V.
M. I. and Wake Forest.

Concerning the Davidson coaching
staff Wingfield made the following state-
ment: “In my opinion Coach McEver is
one of the best backfield coaches in the
south. Coach Newton has done wonders
with the light material he has had to
work with, When Newton and Mc-
Ever get their heads together and think
up a defensive formation, it’s good.
They are real defensive coaches.”
Simons is the best back that Wing-
field has come up against this year.
Buckler was also quite a threat. He
thinks that Parker is, with exception
of Mackorell, the most versatile back
in the state.

Foe Wingfield And Ff. B. Lee
Give Their Opinions On Game

’Cat Center Is Optimistic About
Remaining Contests

J. B. Lee, pivot man on the Wildcats
this fall, has had the hardest position
on the team to fill. He made his letter
last year in competition with McElrath
and West, and this year the burden
descended directly on him when the oth-
er two graduated. In spite of his light
weight he has held down the position
very well.

Concerning the V. M. I. game this
Saturday, Lee says that it will turn out in
a Davidson victory, if the team will not
get over-confident, as they did at the
Citadel game. “If we can only play as
we played against Carolina or Duke,”
he said, “we can take otir next two
games in fine style.”

Lee thinks that a large part of what
success Davidson has had in football
during the past two years has been due
to Coaches Newton and McEver. “I've
heen coached for eight years,” he said,
“but these coaches have taught me more
of the tricks of the game than any
others. They are very thorough in
teaching the fundamentals of the game.”

Along the line of-—predictions, Lee
picks Duke to win easily over Carolina
this Saturday. He thinks Duke has the
better team and is a cinch to win the
Big Five championship.

Of all the centers he has met this
season Lee picks Clifford of Army as
the best. Barclay of North Carolina did
almost as well in backing up the line.
The best linemen he has seen include
Barclay, Jack Dunlap) of Duke, and
Durner, also-of Duke. Lee says that
Ray Rex of State is the hardest man to
stop he has even seen. He also rates
Buckler of Army, Parker of Duke, and
Hutchins of Carolina at the top of the
list of ball carriers.

Davidson First In Country To De-
velop Forward Pass

Continuing the “History of Football
at Davidson” begun last week, the an-
nuals tell us of the conditions under
which early teams played. Equipment
was not plentiful and rarely was more
than one substitute taken on a trip. Yet
Davidson was at this time one of the
foremost colleges in the country as re-
gards football, numbering Army, Navy,
Auburn and Georgia Tech on its sched-
ules.

George Stevens, a graduate of Caro-
lina living in Charlotte, coached the first
few teams and Dr. Martin assisted in
after years. In 1900 we note the ar-
rival of the first regular.coach, Coach
Brewin. The annual says of this: “Da-
vidson has learned many things this year
about football but more than anything
else—a coach is “sine qua-non” to a
successful team.” 2

Dr. J. W. McConnell, the present
college physician, played on~the 1900
team and was manager in 1901. In 1903,
W. M. Fetzer, afterwards a Davidson
coach, was captain and Dr. Ben Lacy
was quarterback.

Players in those days could evidently
“take it.” Dr. Douglas relates that it
was the usual order for Davidson to
play William and Mary on Saturday and
Washington and Lee the following
Monday. The records show that David-
son usually won both these games. It
was also the custom to play Georgia
University on Saturday and Georgia
Tech the following Monday.

The prize story of endurance, how-
ever, is told by Dr. Douglas of Furman,
who in one year played Davidson on
Friday, U. N. C. on Saturday, N. C.

State on Monday and beat all three of

Kappa Sigs Beat Pikas
To Take Football Title

The Kappa Sigma won the inter-

defeated the Pikas 12-6 and _ thereby
took first place in the race for the fra-
ternity athletic trophy. Greater interest
was shown in this tourney than any ever
staged before, it was announced.

This football title gives the Kappa

Pikas come second with 15. The K. A.
and the S. P. E., both semi-finalists,
tied for third honors with 7 1-2 points
apiece.

Nine fraternities entered the tourna-

over fourteen men taken-on a trip.

Prominent players in those days were
Drs. McCoy, Peeler and Matheson, now
of Charlotte, who attended a medical
school at Davidson which combined with
Davidson in athletics. Prof. Blythe tells
of two 225 pound tackles, Lentz and
Whittaker, from this school. J. B. Johin-
son, now president of the Alumni Asso-
ciation, and A. A. MacFadyen, now mis-
sionary to China, played on teams of
this period. Both of the latter men
have sons in college now.

FIGHTING WILDCATS
BOW TO TAR HEELS

DUKE DEFEATS
FRESHMEN 14-8

Game Featured By Long Runs;
Hogan, Williams, Fisher And
Hackney Star

Duke's powerful and heavy frosh
overwhelmed the hard fighting Wildkit-
tens, 14-6, last Friday before a good
crowd of students and alumni.

The Duke Imps made their first count-
er in the second quarter after a brilliant
goal-line defense by the ’Kittens. The
second quarter opened with the ball in
Duke’s possession on Davidson's 25-yard
line. A pass,. Hackney to Fisher,
brought it to the Davidson five. Here the
Kittens stiffened and stopped the power-
ful threat on the 1-foot line. Hogan’s
punt was blocked behind his goal ‘and
Eakin fell on the ball for a touchdown.
Cooper kicked the point after. Later in
the quarter the Davidson frosh seriously
threatened as a result of a pass, Hogan
to Harrison, which netted 40 yards.
Hackney intercepted a pass on his 5-
yard line, intended’ for Nicholson, to
halt the drive. Then Harvison returned
Hackney’s punt to the Duke 32 and
paved the way for the ’Kitten score. On
the first down, Hogan passed to Laffer-
ty who raced 25 yards to cross the goal
standing up. The half ended with the
score: Duke 7, Davidson 6.

During the half the student body en-
gaged in the usual peanut battle with no
serious casualties reported.

The second half opened with a series
of fumbles by both teams. Duke recov-
ered Dennis’ fumble on the Davidson 24
and carried it to the 12-yard. stripe.
Here Hogan intercepted Clark’s pass
on his own goal line and dashed 60 yards
down the sidelines before he was tackled
by Clark. Duke held the ’Kittens for
four downs and the ball remained in
midfield for the remainder of the third
quarter,

A determined drive led by Hackney
brought the ball to the Davidson 20-yard
line in the fourth period. On the first
down Smith drove through the center
of the line, scurried 20 yards through
the Davidson secondary and crossed the
goal with no one near him. The ’Kit-
tens were called on to make another
goal-line stand after the kick-off. Ho-
gan’s kick on second down was partially
blocked, going out of bounds on his 25-
yard line. Hackney again ledsthe at-
tack which advanced the ball to the
Davidson five. The 'Kittens held and
Hogan kicked to the Duke 45. The ball
remained in midfield for the rest of the
quarter and after an exchange of punts
the game ended with the ball on David-
son’s 30-yard line. °

Hogan, Wildkitten captain and. half-
back, was the outstanding threat on his
team. His phenomenal punting, togeth-
er with his hard running and accurate
passing drew much favorable comment
from the spectators. Lafferty and
Harrison were also outstanding in the
Davidson backfield and Freeman and
Williams showed up well in the line.
Hackney was the spark-plug of the Duke
attack together with Clark and Linemen
Fisher and Eakin.

Carolina Team

RAIN MARS CONTEST

Mackorell, Wingfield, Siewers
And Morgan Star For Davidson

Before a Home-coming crowd of ten
thousand spectators the Davidson College
gridiron aggregation Saturday, afternoon
held the highly touted University of
North Carolina eleven to a 12-2 score.

The Wildcats garnered their two
points early in the second quarter, and
the Tar Heels came back to get six for
themselves before the first half ended.
In the third period Carolina put over
another touchdown, and the score re-
mained 12-2 until the final whistle.

Johnny Mackorell, Davidson quarter-
back was the spearhead of his team’s at-
tack, turning in a nice game both offen-
sively and defensively. He was very
ably assisted by “Joe” Wingfield in the
backfield, and Johnny Siewers, Jim Mor-
gan, and “Big Six” Johnston, in the line.

Don Jackson led the Tar Heel on-
slaught, paving the way for both touch-
downs by his bullet like passes and
superb running. Hits teammates Jim
Hutchins and “Monty” Montgomery, a
pair of fast stepping leather luggers,
also covered a good deal of ground in
their afternoon invasion.

In the Carolina line Captain George
Barclay, Jim Tatum, Dick Buck and Ed-
die Kahn showed up best.

Johnny Siewers, Wildcat tackle, cre-
ated a mild sensation by nailing Tar ,
Heel punt receivers in their tracks on all
but two occasions.

Soon after the second quarter began
Johnny Mackorell punted to Jackson
who was downed on the Carolina five
yard line by Johnny Siewers. Montgom-
ery got three yards on a left end run,
and on the next play Jackson dropped
back behind the goal line to punt, but
a bad pass from center made it impos-
sible for him to kick, and in an effort
to run out of danger he was smothered
in the end zone by several Wildcats,
giving Davidson a safety and two points.

The Tar Heels then opened up a de-
termined attack, which after very effec-
tive thrusts at the Wildcat line and an
18 yard pass from Jackson to Buck Mc-
Carn, Tar Heel flankman, put them on
Davidson’s 30 yard line. Hutchins then
took the leather to the 20, Jackson made
3 more around end, and Montgomery
went over from the six for the fiirst
touchdown. Daniel tried to kick the
extra’ point from placement, but it was
knocked wide by a Davidson lineman.

To open the second half the Newton-
ites pulled an on side kick. The ball
was being held for Mackorell to kick. off
and Paul Pittman, who had entered
the game for Dewey Hutchins, came
up from one side and kicked the ball to
the side of the field where Coley Wind-
ham fell on the ball, giving it to David-
son on Carolina’s 45 yard line. They
were forced to punt, however, before
gaining a first down.

There were two exchanges of punts
before Carolina~began a ‘sustained-drive
from her own 14 yard line. With half-
back Hutchins carrying the ball on ten
out of twelve successive plays, featuring
two gains one for 27 yards and another
for 16, the ball was driven to David-
son’s 4, from which point Jackson went
over to make theéscore 12-2 in Caro-
lina’s favor. Daniel again failed on his
attempted conversion.

The ’Cats showed their best offensive
form in the fourth quarter, when they
made three first downs, the only ones
they garnered during the contest. John-
ny Mackorell and “Joe” Wingfield did
most of the toting in this gound gaining
spree. The Wildcat captain got loose
for two nice gains and 9 and 12 yards,
and “Joe”. took a side wheeling jaunt
around end for 17 yards.

The Davidson passing attack was
molested by a thunder shower that fell
a few minutes before the opening kick
off. More rain fell during the final
quarter also.
