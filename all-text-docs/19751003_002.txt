YMCA fund drive supports

STEP, community projects

By SCOTT REID
Staff Writer
The Davidson College

YM/YWCA will use the funds
it raised during the past week
to support STEP tutoring, a
junior-high coffeehouse, the
Ada Jenkins Community Cen-
ter, various other programs,
and to pay off the mortgage on
the Depot.

Of the programs the “Y”’
sponsors or supports, the
STEP tutoring program is the
most monetarily demanding.
This afternoon, for example,
the 75 college student tutors
will get together with their
tutees for a picnic on the
Davidson Village Green.

“At least once a month we
try to get everyone involved
with STEP together for some
type of group activity such as
a movie or a kite-flying con-
test,‘ said YM/YWCA Presi-
dent Sue Cunningham. “One
day last year everyone went
roller-skating.”’

This year, for the first time,
the “Y” will be running a
weekly coffeehouse for junior
high school students. ‘‘It’s for
those students between 13 and
15 years old who can’t drive
anywhere,” explained Cun-
ningham. ‘‘We will be using
funds to repaint and repair the
Depot so that we can hold
dances and other activities
there.”

The Y’s Depot building,
located behind the Davidson
Post Office and next to the
railroad tracts, still has a
mortgage outstanding of
$1,500. Most of the funds
raised this year will go toward
full payment of that mort-
gage.

‘‘We also want to establish a
‘human resource center’ in the
Activities Room of the college

Union,’”’ said Cunningham.
“Tt will be a library of infor-
mation on where to go locally
for birth control information,
drug counseling, and other
kinds of advice, the kinds of
advice one might not feel
totally at ease asking Will
Terry for.” ,

That information will be
left on a reading table and on
the book shelves in the Stu-
dent Activities Room unat-
tended and free for anyone’s
Now that the ““Y”’ has raised
its money for this year’s
operating expenses, Cunning-
ham is afraid it will drop from
most students’ sight.

Farrell establishes ‘training table’

By KARL GOODHOUSE
Staff Writer

The Davidson College Foot-
ball team began eating at a
‘training. table’’ at Rusk
House on Tuesday. Estab-
lished primarily to counter the
great losses of weight incurred
by the Football team, the
“training table” is a part of
the past history of Davidson
College Athletic Programs.

Up until the closing of the
old College Union, the “‘table”’
was an integral part of athletic
life. When the Union closed,
the concept was dropped.

Football Coach Edward
Farrell commented that “the
biggest problem, in light of
the eating situation at Dav-
idson, was procurring ‘the
facilities. Now that we have
them, there is no problem.”

Farrell cited two reasons for
establishing a ‘‘table.’’ First,
the unnusual hours of practice
(for .example practices on

‘greatest

“It seems that we get our.
most exposure during the fund
drive and then disappear into
our programs. This year, with
several new programs and the
old ones still needing con-
tinuous support, we can’t
afford to let that happen.”’

Continued Cunningham,

“The ‘Y’ isthe main link on

campus between the students
and the local community.

When an elementary school
teacher says,‘ Here is a student
that needs help,’ we are the
ones who get a Davidson
student to help. We need
volunteers to help us run all of

our programs.”

Monday nights at 6:15) make
it difficult for players to get
dinner.

Second, to counter the great
losses of weight incurred by
the players. Neither the
amount of food available on
the A.R.A. ‘“maxi-plan,’’ nor
from the houses on Patterson
Court is adequate for football
players burning up large
amounts of calories.

“In conjunction with the
rigors of study, this makes it
difficult, if not impossible, to
keep players healthy,” com-
mented Farrell.

Tabled

The table is financed with
the money players were
paying to their respective
eating houses, and subsidized
with funds from the football
budget.

Farrell stated that the
percentage is
coming from the student him-
self.”’

Farrell feels that the prog-

lures foreign students

‘Ghigo claims ’75-76 group

contains no lemons

By BILL BARNES
Copy Editor

“I came here basically be-
cause an international scholar-
ship is one hell of a cheap way
to get into the States, which I
have a sort of fascination
with.”’

John Kirk is English, from
the University of Reading. He
is one of 17 International
Exchange students studying
at Davidson College this year.
Their home countries range
from South America to Europe
to the East.

Some international students
are taking degree-oriented
courses here. Others, like
Kirk, are here for no official
credit and have come to the
United States for the sake of
knowing it, thus fulfilling one
of the aims of the Office of
International Education at
Davidson - ‘‘a broader appre-
ciation of world culture.”’

Dr. Ghigo, of the intern-
ational education office, is
pleased with this year’s set of
students. ‘‘Sometimes we’ve
gotten some lemons,” he com-
mented, ‘‘but this looks like a
real good group.”

Each international student
has a “host family’”’ in the
Davidson community and an
international studies commit-
tee coordinates activities for
them. Mrs. R. D. Thompson,
in the Office of International
Education, finds this commit-

ram is ‘‘working fine.’’ ‘‘While
it is most everyone who needs
it, it is not a mandatory
program.”

No knock

He commented that the food
service and the eating houses
have been most cooperative in
their handling of the situation
and stresses that the table is
not designed to ‘‘knock or
undercut the eating system.”’

Ron Scott, director of
A.R.A. Food Services re-
iterated Farrell’s comments on
the efficiency of the program.
He feels that the program will
pay for itself.

Scott provides the team
with a diet of ‘‘low cost, high
protein items.’”’ The emphasis
is on casseroles, ham and
other meats, salads, and
fruits; “food that will give the
players the calories they
need.’ said Scott.

Unlimited sé@¢onds, except
on some meats, are offered the
players.

tee ‘‘very helpful in getting us
along on a-near-zero budget.”

“I hope’ they (the intern-
ational students) come to us if
they have any problems,’’ she
continued. ‘‘But their host
families have done a lot to
make them feel at home.”

The international office in-
dicated that they had warned
foreign students that David-
son wasnota ge university.
In the past eral students
had complai’ _ that they were
not informed or the size of the
College and had expected more
from the curriculum than was
offered.

This problem does not seem
to have occurred. Most foreign
students find Davidson like-
able, though lacking social
outlets. ‘‘The campus is too
closed,’’ commented Claudine
Garcia, from the University of
Montpellier.

Kirk told The Davidsonian
that he hadn’t expected ‘‘a
lack of organized social life
and so few bars. There’s very
little outlet for social drin-
king.”

Like American exchange
students in other countries,
this year’s foreign students at
Davidson want to travel. One
common goal seems to be
California, another New York,
though some students, inclu-
ding Paulina Miranda of Chile,
have expressed a dislike for
The City.

Scott is emphatically for the
program. He stated that ‘I
have been behind ‘training
table’ since we dropped it, not
only for football, but for all
sports. If we are going to be in
major sports, we should treat
them the best that we can.”

The training table, has, in
fact, been planned for the
Basketball team this year,
according to Scott. He forsees
continuing the program in the
future for all sports, either in
the same vein, or possibly
offering a Super-maxi plan
next year.

Jeff Neikirk, President of
Patterson court, sees no major
problems in cooperating with
the program. He did state
though, that ‘‘we could have
used more advanced notice.
Otherwise, I think it speaks |
highly of those who are doing
it, in terms of the sacrifices
they are’ making in leaving
their houses and of their
loyalty to*the team.”
