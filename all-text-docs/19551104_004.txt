The Davidsonian salutes John
Brice this week for his long and
excellent record at the college. He
has been employed by Davidson for
twenty-one years. Starting his work
here as a janitor in Georgia Dor-
mitory, he has served as janitor
in East, Watts. and Chambers. Dur-
ing his nine years of work in Geor-
gia, John did not miss a single
day. For the past eleven years,
Brice has worked in Chambers as
mailman and supervisor of the
mimeograph.

Brice is perhaps the most in-
formed on what is going on on the
campus, knowing most of the stu-
dents by name and activities. There
are few things that happen in the
town of Davidson which are missed
by his keen perception and not
given full benefit of his bright out-

UPON WILDCATS

This subject on the Guaranteed
Annual Wage should prove quite
provocative, as it has been much
discussed in recent months, par-
ticularly since the major automo-
bile industries have accepted this
radical change in their labor poli-

cy. It will not be difficult to find ;

speakers for either side.

The Forensic Council is open to
any student who has an interest in
debate. Within the next few weeks,
try outs will be held here on. the
campus. Anyone who is interested
should familiarize himself with the
debate material which is on reserve
in the library. A notice to the time
of the try out, and the details of
the requirements will be announced
at a later ‘date.

The size of the Forensic Council
is somewhat limited in size be-

its members from the members of
the Forensic Council. While the
Forensic Council is open to anyone
who participates in the debate pro-
gram, membership in TKA is based
on two years of participation in de-
bate here at Davidson.

Anyone who is interested in the
Forensic Council is asked to con-
tact Professor Tyson, or some
member of the Forensic Council.

and escaping from a nailed-in.wood- |

pany made the box and issued the
challenge to Birch to escape from
it.

From the audience's standpoint.
however, it was a young lad named
James who stole the show. Quite a
comedian himself, James was the!
first. member of the audience to
be awarded an honorary member-
ship in the Junior Guild of Helpers
for Birch (serial No. 19403). Many
deserving individuals were, later
conferred this high honor, how-
ever. These included Allen Hall,
Angus McBryde, and Ed Flato (who
nailed Birch into his wooden box);
a little girl named Mimie; a boy
who called himself John McGavock;
a young lad named Carl Sherrill;
the person in the audience who
started the clapping on one occa-
sion; Sam Smith (although he bare-
ly missed out nailing Birch in his
“easket” since only three were
needed); and possibly some other
Davidson youngsters.

Always ready with an answer,
when asked what his name was,
Birch quipped, “You'd better not
let Shaw Smith hear that after all
his advertising.”

When asked how to tell if a
guinea pig used in a trick was a
boy or a girl, he replied, “That one
has a mustache.”

Other common expressions used
by Birch were his magic word
“Brrrrrrtose,” and the statement,
“This is not funny,” when he drew
laughs. .

Miss Mabel Sperry’s xylophone
solos opened the second half of
the show. Her selections ranged
from “Hungarian Dance No. 5” to
“Lady of Spain.” Miss Sperry is a
brilliant young musical star and
Birch’s chief assistant. She was the
beautiful girl already referred to
whom Birch supposedly sliced into
quarters with “the world’s smallest
meat cleaver,” as he called his
giant butcher's instrument. After
Miss Sperry was given some yel-
low roses by the Union, Birch fit-
tingly changed them into Ameri-
can beauties (roses, that is).

During the latter part of the
show “Mysterio,” an ancient Egyp-
tian idol, performed. It counted
numbers with a hammer and se-
lected colors as Birch named them.
To make the trick “harder,” Birch
blindfolded “Mysterio” for the final
color selection.

The show ended with the presen-
tation of a brilliant spectacle
known as “The Mirage,” in which
Birch pulled beautifully-cotored
silk handkerchiefs from an appar-
ently empty basket.

Birch introduced the famous hyp-
notist, Preston, who was in the
audience witnessing the show along
with C. Shaw Smith, the foremost
magician of the Davidson College
Student Union.

All who saw the show agreed
that Birch merited his greatness

or for current operating use.

‘These facts, long known. to presi-
dents and boards of trustees re-
sponsible for the conduct of col-
leges and universities, are under-
scored by the results of a survey

conducted during 1954 by the Coun-

cil for Financial Aid to Education,
an objective, non-profit, advisory
group founded by leading business
men. In analyzing all data from the
survey, including operating costs
and student fees, the Council di-
vided the 753 responding colleges
and universities into nine logical
categories.

During the five year period 1948-
49 to 1953-54, institutions in’ all
nine of these groups increased
their average charges for student
tuition and fees. Among 184 non-
denominational, independent, lib-
eral arts colleges the average rise
was 24 per cent, from $441 to
$549. On the other hand, between
1947-48 and 1952-53 the average
cost, among this group, of opera-
tions per full-time student rose by
46 per cent, from $726 to $1,060.
The cost per student to the insti-
tution, above his payments, rose
by an even steeper 98 per cent,
from $201 to $397.

Privately supported colleges and
universities therefore attach in-
creasing importance to the Annual
Giving by alumni. This is a means
of supplying a person’s alma mater
with badly needed funds for cur-
rent operations. It is also a means
of repaying what the supporters of
the institution have made available
to the graduate. Gifts to the Alum-
ni Fund are a form of repayment
of a loan by society.

Support of this kind is urgently
needed by all colleges and univer-
sities, both independent and tax-
supported. It is a means of insur-
ing that the institutions will be
able to render as good service to
future generations as they render
to the present.

One of the first tests of a good
alumnus is his recognition of an
opportunity to help the college that

The Danforth Foundation is plan-

fellowships to graduating seniors
‘who plan to do graduate study in
preparation for college teaching.
Selections are made on the basis
of outstanding academic ability,
personality congenial to the class-
room, and integrity and character,
including faith and commitment in
the Christian tradition. The Dan-
forth Foundation offers financial
assistance to its Fellows according
to individual need. Among recent
Davidson winners of the Danforth
Fellowships have been Henry
Brockman ‘55, Ed Stuart, ‘54, and
Allen Garrison ‘63. Seniors inter-
ested in the Danforth Fellowships

George L. Abernethy.

Dr. George L. Abernethy has an-

planning to do graduate study are
urged to find out whether the
Graduate Record Examination is
required for admission to the grad-

president. It was announced at the
meeting that Congressman Charles

possible that Mr. Jonas might be on
the campus for some time preceed-
ing or following chapel, and many
are looking forward to meeting and
talking with him.

Plans were discussed for start-
ing Young Republicans Clubs on
other campuses and increasing the
size and effectiveness of the local
chapter. All interested persons are
cordially invited to attend the
meetings every other Tuesday
night.

A movie on the participation of
young Americans, the “amateurs,”
in the everyday business of politics
was shown, and refreshments were
