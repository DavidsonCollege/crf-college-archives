Chairman of Board
of Ford Motor
Speaks to
Board of Visitors

hh, a 1 speech before the Daviisdn Col-
lege Board of Visitors at the Vail Com-
mons last night, Philip Caldwell, Chair-
man of the Board. and Chief Executive
officer of the Ford Motor Company
called for a “commitment to excellence”
to help restore confidence “in our na-
tional competitiveness.” He also said,
“T would argue that what our economy
needs most today is not skill or knowl-
edge—but appropriate attitudes and
values to guide our leadership, and it
seems to me that our great liberal-arts
institutions have a truly vital role to play
in this regard. Indeed, I see them in the
front line. . . .Don’t we have to say that
we need good men and women with a
liberal education and minds tuned to the
broader realities of the world? Don’t we
have to extend our hands and minds to
institutions like Davidson—to help you
find places for them and see that we do
not merely educate them for unemploy-
ment?”

In an interview before the speech,
however, Caldwell came short of prom-
ising increased hiring of liberal. arts
graduates or corporate support of liberal
arts schools like Davidson. He said,

“The need is for.a balanced, offering:in
the educational process.

“It is necessary we have technical
people of various types. But it is also
quite essential that we have those who -
have the capabilities to deal with the un-
organized problems of the world,” he
said.

- He foresaw no increase in hiring of
liberal arts graduates, and said that cor-
porate giving would depend on corpo--
rate profits. -

said that Ford has not sent recruiters to"
Davidson, nor takes any interns. Direc-

members convene once a year.
In other comments, Caldwell said that
he expects a 30-40 % increase in car

buying in the next two or three years. .

This increase would result from the
“pent-up demand,” he said.
He also said that Ford is considering

having factory workers in dealer show-

rooms as a marketing tool. “We want
the men and women who actually make.
our cars to communicate with the men
and women who buy them . . . to ex-
plain what we do and the quality pro-
grams we have.”

“She’s been a great coach,” explained
junior tennis player Joanna Fleming,

“but we understand she’s got to follow
- her husband.”

In swimming, her teams posted 63

en yéars she was named Southern Con©

“We hate to lose Pat and Tom,” said
Ed Farrell, athletic director and football

work for us. Pat’s record is exceptional.
Replacing her will be difficult.”

with him there,” said Frank. “He won
our round-robin. tournament in Florida
rather handily. We had another series of
challenge matches this. past weekend,

and so now he’s playing no. 1. It may be
to our advantage to have either Mark or
Nevins at No. 1. Since they’ve seen the
guy they’ll be playing, and remember
them from last year. I feel good about
our singles situation, and our doubles
are coming around. Overall for this part
of the season, everything looks good.”

DCF Workday

Last-Fall eighty—five people. were
involved in tasks that ranged from a ma-
jor roof repair job to washing hundreds
of windows. Other projects included
painting the back of a house, paneling a
porch, building a closet, and cleaning
gutters. What motivated all these people
to take time out to give a hand in com- °

_pleting these tasks? It was a desire to

reach out to our community to show our
concern by serving our neighbors where
there are real needs.

If you would like to serve others ina
similar way, an opportunity. will be of-
fered next on Friday afternoon, April
23, by the Davidson Christian Fellow-
ship. Materials will be supplied, so all
you need is a willing heart and a few
hours of your time. Please contact Anne
