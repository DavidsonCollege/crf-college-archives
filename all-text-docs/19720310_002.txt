Alumni Majority Favors Coeducation

By DOUG BROWN
Managing Editor

Of the 27 per cent of the
alumni responding to the Educa-
tional Policy Committee's Sub-
committee on Coeducation ques-
tionnaire, 59.3 per cemt stated
that they were “‘in favor of in-
creasing the number of women
students at Davidson.”

The coeducation plan most fa-
vored by the alumni was to in-
crease Davidson's enrolment by
admitting from 300 to 500 wom-
en as regular students while
keeping the number of men Stu-
dents at approximately the pres
ent level.

This plan received support
from 36.5 per cent of the alum-
oi, and the second largest per-
centage of alumni (15.9 per
cent) favored the admission of
up to 100 women as transfer
students on an experimental
basis. The increased enrollment
plan was also favored by a ma-
jority of students, faculty, and
staff.

Coeducation has been studying
the educational feasibility of co-
education, the Budget, Build-
ings and Grounds Committee
has had a subcommittee, chair-
ed by Comptroller Robert W.
Davidson, studying the financial
aspects of coeducation.

The two subcommittee re-
ports will be considered by the
Educational Policy Committee,
which will make a recommen-
dation to the faculty. The fac-
ul:y’s recommendations will be
referred to the president, who
will make his recommendations
to the college trustees. The
trustees are scheduled to con-
sider the matter in May.

The series of questionnaires
were distributed to all Davidson
constituents. Completed forms
were returned by 83.5 per cent
of the faculty, 60.3 per cent of
the students. and 52.7 per cent
of the staff. Of Davidson's near-
ly 10,0000 alumni, 2,655 returned
the survey.

Of Davidson's constituents, the
alumni favor coeducation the

coeducation in comparison to a
favorable opinion by 68.6 per
cent of the faculty, 75.9 per cent
of the staff, and 90.7 per cent
of the students.

The argumem for coeducation
“most convincing” was, ‘‘the
college environment would be
a more natural place in which

Possible arguments against co-

Clubs Open Doors
For Self-Selection

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

In preparation for the March
14 self selection of fraternities
by the freshman class, the 10
Patterson Court eating clubs
staged open houses during Tues-
day and Wednesday nights.

The reactions were definitely
mixed in regard to both hosts
and guests, and their respective
evaluations of the preceedings.

“Everything’s working out
pretty well,” commented Ray
Swetenburg, head of the Pi Kap-
pa Alpha eating club, who was
pleased with Tuesday night's
turnout.

In regard to the same situa-
tion, however, Randy Parker of
Fannie and Mabel’s thought that
the turnout has been ‘‘slow” due

eration expenditure per student
were adversely affected.

On the question of when the
first women should be admitted,
28.9 per cent of the alumni pre-
fer that funds at least for the
first two or three vears be rais-
ed before coeducation is phased
in.

In the important area of
whether the alumni would be
willing to contribute towards the
capital expenses involved in go-
ing coeducational, 43.8 per cent
of the alumni said they would,
30.1 per cent said they would
not, and the rest were not sure.

When asked if Davidson's be-
coming coeducational would ef-
fect the level of their annual
giving, 18 per cent of the alumni
said they would give more, 53.0
per cent would give about the
same, 6.8 per cent would give
less, and 22.2 per cent were not
sure.

somewhat to the lack of interest
of the upperclass members of
the house in promoting the oc.
casion.

Emmanon's Jim Thompson
took the opposite view from
Parker, claiming that the fresh
men themselves hadn’t taken
full advantage of the situation
in coming down and asking
questions about the social situa.
tion each house had to offer.

Indeed, in advertising the open
house schedule to the freshmen,
Thompson had gone to all four
floors in Cannon dorm on Mon.
day evening, and only two had
shown up at the meetings.

Regardless of the fault, the
initial freshman response was
far from expected. Only an es
timated 40 per cent of the class
participated the first night, de-
spite the numerous invitations.

Danny Thorne of the SPEs,
claiming that the open house
policy might have been better
advertised, nonetheless put much
of the blame for the slow reac-
tion om the very nature of new
policy as opposed to the idea of
rushing.

“Freshmen don’t feel as ac
cepted or wanted as we did
when we went through,” he
said, stating an opinion frequent-
ly expressed by the various fra-
ternity leaders.

Nevertheless, none of the eat
ing house members or the fresh-
men who did turn out desired
to return to the old system.

Almost all of those freshmen
thought that the experience had
been informative and helpful, as
exemplified by Bob Wetzel who
was “impressed by the house
hospitality”.

The only real complaint among
freshmen seemed to be in the
line of registration for places in
eating clubs, most feeling it an
unsatisfactory method much like

Career-Service Inaugurated:
Kincaid Announces Positions

By BRUCE MALOY
Staff Writer

Under a new program ap-
proved by the faculty at its
February 15 meeting, students
can now be placed in an ‘‘ex-
periential” learning situation
for a term or a term and a
summer.

The new program called Ca-
reer/Service, offers students an
opportunity to work in hospitals,
legal offices, public agencies,
businesses and a variety of oth-
er locations.

Program director Randall R.
Kincaid Jr. said that ‘‘there are
a few positions already avail-
able. If interested students see
me immediately, there is a pos-
sibility of placing them in a
job for this summer and next
fall.”

The program director is re-
sponsible for finding the posi-
tions and assisting the students
in placement.

Kincaid added, ‘‘Positions al-
ready available are: an inner
city agency in Newark, N. J., a
job with the N. C. Department
of Corrections, an internship at

the Smithsonian, an internship
with a furniture manufacturing
firm, jobs with various agen-
cies in Charlotte, work with dis-
turbed children and an opening
with access to the House Com-
mittee on Science and Astronau-
tics.”

Students who have been at
Davidson College for two terms
and who are making normal
progress toward a degree are
eligible for participation in Ca-
reer/Service.

Students may or may not be
able to earn money in Career/
Service. Positions will be sought
on the basis of their educational

value and not because they pay
well.

Participating students earn no
academic credit for Career-/
Service itself. However, credit
may be earned through Extend-
ed Studies, independent study,
or foreign language department
offerings if the work involves
foreign travel or experience.

Normally, students will not be
able to earn full academic ered-
it (three courses) during one
term of Career/Service. Defi-
ciencies may be made up by
advanced placement, summer
school, or the accelerated prog-
ress program.

vey groups and to keep them
informed via college publica-
tions.

A few of the administrators
contacted recommended that
enough women be admitted in-
itially so that ‘they would not
fell like ‘‘an isolated minority,"
and that “‘coeducating the facul

ty"’ be given serious considera
tion.

When asked, “If you had to
do it over again, would you be
in favor of coeducation at your
institution,"’ each responded ac-
cording to Patterson, “seem
ed genuinely convinced that the
move to coeducation was the
right one for his _ institution.
Most of them added comments
to suggest that this was the
view also of the academic com-
munity which they seryed.”
