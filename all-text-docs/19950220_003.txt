NC Bio-tech gives
Campbell money

The North Carolina Biotech-
nology Center, an organization
which fosters biotechnology edu-
cation in educational settings state-
wide, recently granted Assistant
Biology Professor Malcolm
Campbell a $45,000 award for one
year. With the grant, Campbell
will turn Davidson’s biology labo-
ratories into a DNA research cen-
ter for the use of students in his
molecular biology class.

Students working with
Campbell will work to discover
where the four antibodies in a
chicken bind to protein that acts as
a calcium “pump” in the flight
muscles of chickens. The results
and research in Campbell’s course
will aid in research at Johns
Hopkins University. Dr. Doug
Fambrough of Johns Hopkins will

provide Campbell with the DNA
and antibodies needed to begin the
research conducted at Davidson.
Forty thousand dollars of the
grant will go towards purchasing
equipment for the research. The
new equipment will shorten result
time by two to five hours, giving
results in only three hours — the

length of a biology lab period. The

other $5,000 will go towards
chemicals, glass, and plasticware
necessary for the experiment. In
the future, Davidson College will
provide funding for nts aspect of
the project.

The grant affords students a
unique research opportunity.
Campbell explains, “It’s exciting
for me because I don’t know the
answer to the question; and hope-
fully, it will be exciting for stu-
dents because they’ Il be doing cut-
ting edge research and discovering
the answer to a scientific puzzle.”

instructors.

Nominees need not be the
flashiest lecturers, best dressed, or
most entertaining. The selection
committee is particularly interested
in professors who have demon-
strated concern for their students
on an individual basis both in and
out of the classroom.

Students should nominate
teachers who have made an overt
effort to get to know them by name
and explain complicated class ma-
terial and have instilled in them the
desire to learn and grow. Nomi-
nees must be full-time members of
the faculty who have been teach-
ing at Davidson for at least five
years.

March 15, 1995 is the dead-
line for the submission of recom-
mendations. Letters should be sub-
mitted to Brenda King in the
President’s Office.

They called the police from

description of the robber.

The police put out an A.P.B.
for the man. An officer named
Burke promptly came to the scene
on the crime and got a further de-

for them to think about.

Both students want to convey
animportant message: “Don’t walk

the reaction of the police, Browett
believes that robbers on bikes are
not a rare occurrence.

Halyburton says, “No matter

usually is willing to do so.”
