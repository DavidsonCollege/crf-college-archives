Sigma Upsilon Holds Ex-
cellent Meeting

Dr. Erwin Affiliates With Blue Pencil
Club

The first meeting of Sigma Upsi-
lon this year was called at nine
o’clock last Wednesday night in the
S. A. E. Hall. The members for
this year are Cumming, W. P.,
Walker, J. R., Mahood, D. R., Mc-
Caskill, C. M., Long, C. H., Cassell,
J. E. Long, F. V. A new faculty ad-
dition to the roll was Dr, Erwin,
professor of English, who was a
member of the Scribbler’s Chapter
of Sigma Upsilon at Mississippi,

After some business had been
brought up, and disposed of, Joe
Walker introduced the literary pro-
gram of the evening by a talk on
the mountaineers of western North
Carolina. The speaker was in very
close contact with the peoples of
this section last summer, and _ his
talk was filled with personal rem-
iniscences which made it of especial
interest to the readers.

The next person to “speak” was
D. R. Mahood. Mahood did not
speak at all, but lead the entire
audience into a spiritual discussion
of a much battered and maligned

oet,—Walt Whitman. Finally, Dr.

rwin was called upon to deliver a
verdict, and his opinion was that
Walt Whitman’s poetry was a
strange and new type, but neverthe-
less was entitled to be called poetry.
The last to address-the Sigma Upsi-
lon was W. P. Cumming, who read
a touching and saddening poem en-
titled, Eventide. This poem was
composed last summer while the
author was drifting o’er the sunset-
tinted waters of Deer Park Lake in
a birch canoe. The poem begins
with praise of the glorious attrib-
utes of morning, but goes on to
show the fuller riches of human
bliss and happiness to be found at
eventide.

The serious part of the evening
being declared ended, everyone ad-
journed to a heavily laden table,
which drove dull care away to the
tune of popping dope bottle and
choice selections of Miss Yinnie’s
sandwiches and cake.

This Year’s Magazine to
be Best Ever

Goes to Press October 15—New Men
Urged to Contribute .

“We are going to make the Dav-
idson College Magazine the best
Magazine in the South.”

This is the unanimous purpose of
the members of the Magazine staff
as announced at the close of their
initial meeting held last Thursday
night when plans for the following
year were discussed.

The make-up of the Magazine is
to be changed from that of former
years. The new publication will
be about the size of “Life” and con-
tain forty pages of three columns
each. An attractive cover design
is now being prepared by local
artists.

All the staff has not yet been
selected, but the following are at
the head of their respective depart-
ments: W. P. Cumming, Editor-in-
Chier; J..R. Boulware, assistant edi-
tor and acting essay editor; W. J.
Cooper, fiction editor; D. R. Free-
man, poetry editor: D. L. “Mahood,
exchange editor. A. M. Mitchell is
business manager. ~

It is especially urged that all new
men who have any prize essays.
stories, or poems, contribute them
for the first issue. The college mag-
azine always reflects the best liter-
ary lights of the college, and it is
the duty of every student to sup-
port this publication to the best of
his ability, both in interest and in
contributions.

In order to stimulate a greater in-

terest in the Magazine, Dr. Shew-.

make, head of the English depart-
ment, announces that credit will be
given for-all articles accepted by the
magazine. This should prove a fur-
ther inducement for the students to
put forth their best literary efforts.
The first issue goes to press Octo-
ber the fifteenth. Hand your articles
to the editors now and help get the
magazine out on schedule time.

dry did not open until Wednesday

but they all were delivered by

One half the students will take
their laundry on Monday morning
and call for same Wednesday after-
noon. The others will leave clothes
on Wednesday morning and call for

Mr. H. P. Helper is manager of
