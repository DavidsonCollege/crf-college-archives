Wigginton philosophizes

By CHARLES ERWIN
Staff Writer

When Eliot Wigginton, editor of
the nationally best-selling Foxfire
books, came on campus last Monday
he brought with him five knife-toting,
pool-hustling, backwoods teenagers
from Rabun County, Georgia.

Introducing high school students to
college life is part of what the Foxfire
program is all about—education. Not
old-fashioned ‘“‘listen to it, memorize
it, spit it back on tests’’ garden
variety education, but experiential
education.

As each student gave a short talk
at the Union programs on Foxfire,
phrases such as ‘‘not that I reckon of”’
and “‘there’s really not no use for it
‘cept to fiddle with’’ flowed so fast
and steady that the audience might
have thought they were at a Salt Lake
City production of Tom Sawyer.

But judging by the favorable
reactions of their audience, their
down-to-earth comments revealed a
greater feeling for the Appalachian
culture than a strictly grammatical
form could have conveyed.

The Foxfire empire has grown like
weeds since the first issue of the
student compiled méuntain culture
magazine came out eleven years ago.

Walsh rocks Eagles;

You can tell you’re in store fora
different album from the Eagles just
by looking at the cover art. Instead of
the usual Western motif on their
previous albums, the cover art on this
album is almost surreal. And the first
time you play the album you'll be in
for a surprise.

If you feared that the addition of
Joe Walsh would transform the band
into Joe Walsh and the Eagles, your
fears are unfounded. Walsh's influ-
ence is very noticeable, and a welcome
addition.

Side One opens with ‘‘Hotel Calli-
fornia’, the title cut. The vocals are
not done by Walsh, but by drummer
Don Henley.: While Henley has sung
on previous albums, he ha&s never
sung in this style which has been
influenced by Walsh in a positive
way. The guitar work of Walsh and
Don Felder is excellent.

‘New Kid In Town”’ is the second
cut, and written by John David
Souther, whose influence is definitely
in evidence in'the familiar Eagles
style.

“Life in the Fast Lane” is all Joe
Walsh, and his style is identifiable
from the first measure which makes
this the best. This song is the closest
the Eagles have ever come to playing

contained articles on how to make
moonshine and log cabins, has sold
nearly two million copies, the second
over a million, and the third just
under a million. Foxfire IV is due to
be out on the counters this summer
and Foxfire V is already being
prepared.

Even though many areas of moun-
tain life have already been written
about, Wig, as the students call him,
does not yet see any limitation in
future subjects for articles. ‘‘We’re
getting new ideas all the time,’’ he
said.

With over $500,000 a year in
royalties, Foxfire has purchased a
110-acre plot of land in Rabun County
on which 25 endangered log buildings
have been moved. The group new
owns and operates its own printing
shop, television studio, and recording
studio. This spring, they plan to open
up their own furniture company.

When Wig talks about the educa-
tional gold mine these facilities pro-
vide his high school students, it is
with the conviction that students can
successfully operate the equipment
and learn a great deal about the real
word in doing so.

“The kids are going into the world
believing that if they provide a
quality product they'll do all right.

rock. As a friend said the first time he
heard this cut, ‘‘With Walsh the
Eagles aren't afraid to rock and roll
anymore.”

““Wasted Time’’, a nice mellow
song, concludes Side One. Glenn Frey
displays excellent piano work.

Side Two opens with ‘‘Wasted Time
(Reprise)’’, a nice string arrangement
leading into ‘‘ Victim of Love’’. On
this cut Walsh pulls out his slide
guitar. While never soloing, his work
holds the song together.

The last three cuts, ‘Pretty Maids
All in a Row. Dry and Wove
Again” and ‘‘The Last Resort”’ are in
the style of the old Eagles, and all are
excellent. Listen especially for Frey's
guitar on ‘“‘Try”and Love Again”’. '’

With the addition of Walsh, the
Eagles will never be the same. Old
Eagles fans may have trouble accep-
ting this new album.

Emmy Lou Harris

Warner Brothers

Emmy Lou Harris is one of those
cult artists whose fans adore them,
and the majority of the people have
never heard of. While her solo work
has not received much attention, she
has backed up some excellent people,
including Gram Parsons and Linda
Ronstadt.

Though Linda Ronstadt is a per-
sonal favorite, my note would have to

That’s important,’ said Wigginton as
he flicked his cigarette ashes into a
styrofoam cup.

He spoke of Foxfire as a ‘‘positive
experience’”’ which will tend to offset
‘the negative experiences of the
traditional classroom.”’ And he is not
alone in his thinking.

Hundreds of similar projects have
sprung up all over the nation. One of
the Charlotte high schools now pub-
lishes such a magazine entitled A
Cotton Seed Anthology.

In standardized tests which have
been administered in the public
schools, students who have learned
grammar and writing in experiential
projects such as Foxfire, often score
years ahead of similar students in
traditional classrooms, and seldom
more poorly.

Wigginton maintained that it is
just as important to ‘integrate exper-
iential components into every class in

college as in high school.’’ He stressed =
that these programs don’t have to be |
‘cultural §

confined to what he called
journalism’’, where people are inter-
viewed about their lives.

Wigginton attacked the belief that
college students are eager and moti-
vated to learn in a classroom situa-
tion, calling it a ‘‘bunch of bullshit’.
He said that most people are in
college because they feel it is expected
of them.

album. The cut can’t really be
described, but the closest description
would be up-tempo country /rock. The
guitar work of Albert Lee and Brian
Abern is excellent.

The remainder of the side is
composed of traditional ballads. All of
the lyrics are excellent, and the pedal
steel of Hank DeVito holds the side
together. Good pedal steel work can’t
be beat, and DeVito’s is excellent.

Side Two is a little more diverse in
the style of music presented. The first
cut is ‘(You Never Can Tell) C’est La
Vie’, which was originally down by
Chuck Berry. This version has a
country sound, yet retains the flavor
of Berry’s style.

‘‘When I Stop Dreaming” is the
nicest cut on the album. It features
excellent supporting vocals by Dolly
Parton and a harmonica solo by
Mickey Raphael.

For all those ‘‘they-don’t-make-
‘em-like-they-used-to’’ movie fans on
campus, D.C. Pop Films offers an
opportunity this weekend to see The
Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, a
1962 Western directed by John Ford.

This film, along with Young Mr.
Lincoln (1939), was shown on campus
a couple of years ago in preparation
for a campus visit by Village Voice
film critic Andrew Sarris; presumably
they were considered representative
of Ford’s work in general. His career

Grapes of Wrath, superior to his?
Westerns simply because of the
limitations they see in the Western
game. Yet many critics maintain that
Ford the artist was at his best when
making Westerns. Ford’s most suc-
cessful ‘‘Western period”’ began in
1939 with Stagecoach, perhaps his
most famous film. It was a landmark
not only in Ford’s career but in that of
John Wayne; his performance as the

“Ringo Kid" contributed greatly to
his fame.

traditional country ballad style, yet
each has characteristics that make
them stand out from all the other
songs of this type. ‘‘She”’ is an
especially nice, mellow cut.

The final cut is the only one written
by Emmy Lou, “Tulsa Queen’’. Once
again the harmonica of Mickey Raph-
ael is featured. The supporting vocals
of Fayssoux Starling and Herb Peder-
sen are also excellent.

as filmmaker lasted more than fifty
years, beginning with silent films in
1917, during which time he won six
Oscars for direction.

He worked with many differnt
subjects, yet he is mainly known for
his adaptations of American history
and literature, and for his Westerns.
The most prominent of the former
group is his 1940 film of Steinbeck’s
The Grapes of Wrath.

Some viewers may consider Ford’s
‘‘sociological’’ films, such as The

(he worked for.the navy), but during
the last half of the decade returned to
Westerns with My Darling Clemen-
tine, Fort Apache, and She Wore a
Yellow Ribbon, all considered well-
above-average works.

Liberty Valance represents a later

’ venture by Ford into Westerns after a

number of war films, and it shows
that he hadn’t lost his touch. Like
other, outstanding Westerns, such as

George Stevens’ Shane, it is elemen- .

tal, almost mythological.
