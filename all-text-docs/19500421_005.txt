Track Team Makes Successful Invasion | What

Of Georgia In Running Past Mercer U.

By HARTLEY HALL

The Wildcat cindermen took
eight out of fifteen events to beat
Mercer University on their home
track in Macon, Ga., this past week
end. This was the fourth win over
Mercer for Davidson in as many
years. Pre-meet reports predicted
a wide margin of victory for the
Wildcats, but Mercer showed a bet-
ter team than in past years — most-
ly in the person of Bob Reeder of
Charleston, S. C., who managed to
take four firsts during the course
of the afternoon.

Tommy Haller paced his team
with 11 points, showing up par-
ticularly well in a 27 second low
hurdles. In the sprints it was all
Mercer's show, with Reeder doing
the honors in a 9.7 hundred and a
23.1 two-twenty. Davidson domi-
nated the weights, with Vann, Mill-
er and Lazenby winning the discus,
javelin and shot-put respectively.

In the distance runs Blake Brad-
ly, came through in the mile to
beat Dick Benson of Mercer in a
close race, and Bob Long in the
two miller ran a teriffic race only
to be edged out by Mercer’s Ben-
son, who set a new school record at
Macon with his time of 10:35.6.

Though Pete Brown was missed | ¢

in his usual slot as high jumper,
Fledglings Haller and Fickeisen
did a creditable job of represent-
ing the Cats in this department.

Coach Jim Cowan of Mercer is
a former Davidsonian, playing foot-
ball, basketball, and learning his
track technique from our own Pete
Whittle. The final. score in this
coach-pupil contest showed that Da-

Mars Hill Trackmen Spoil Debut of

Ray Brown’s Promising Youngsters
By J. V. HOWELL

Mars Hill floored the Davidson! just how close the meet was, Da-

Frosh cindermen here at Davidson
Saturday afternoon 78-53 in the
first meet of the season for the
Wildkittens.

Big Billy Myers was the big gun
for Mars Hill, Myers led the Mars
Hill point makers with 9 points
taking first place in the shot, sec-
ond place in the javelin, and third
place in the discus.

For Davidson the two most out-
Standing men were Roy White and
Charlie Calhoun. White was high
scorer of the meet with a total
uf 13 points. He won first places
‘n the high and tow hurdles and
a second place in the broad jump.
Calhoun won the 100 and 220 yard
dashes and tied with Donnahoe of

Mars Hill for third place in the
broad jump.
The final score does not indicate

vidson took six first places out
of a possible 14. Lack of sufficient
contestants in many of the events
gave Mars Hill points.

The time on several of the events
was very good. Bobo of Mars Hill,
who was last year’s 440 high school
champion of South Carolina, ran
the 100 in 10,2 and the 220 in 238.
Several of the other boys looked
exceptionally good and boys such
as Henry, White, Graham, and Cal-
houn should prove to be consistent
point makers of the varsity next
year.

What was billed as a
match between Davidson and Fur-

Posts Important Win
Over Tar Babies

By BILL BRADFORD

The wildkitten netters met the
freshmen of the University of North
Cardlina on the home courts last
Saturday and defeated them by a
match score of 5-4. The singles
matches were split 3-3 and it wasn’t
until the last two doubles were
captured that the contest was de-
cided.

Joe Dudley, playing in the num-
ber five spot, was the only David-
son man to win his singles match
with out having to go into the third

set. Dick Thorpe playing against 61

Spencer probably had the closest
match of the day.

The results for the matches are
as follows:

Izlar (C) defeated Walker, 6-2,
6-4; Thorpe (D) defeated Spencer,
9-7, 2-6, 6-3; Asbury (D) defeated
Loveland, 6-1, 1-6, 0-6; Eshby (¢C)

ed Esby and Neotes, 6-2, 6-4; Walk-
er and Dudley, (D) defeated Love-
land and Pincourt, 6-4, 6-2.

The Freshmen showed great
promise Saturday and if they keep
going at this same pace, they should
have a long list of wins at the ter-
mination of the season.

season 11-4, Allen Groseclose. with

cher for the KA's while Bob Mer-
rill took credit for the loss: John-
ny Kelton lead the hitting: for both
teams with 3 for 3.

HARD-LUCK DIAMOND MEN DROP CLOSE

CAROLINA SQUADS

By DICK LILES

A homer by Clemson third Base-
man Ken Culberson with the bases
loaded, edged the Tigers by the
Cats 13-11 in that important South-
ern Conference game in Clemson
last Saturday. The tremendous
clout highlighted a seven-run sixth
inning rally which brought — the
hosts from behind to take a 11-10
lead,

Clemson opened up quick with
4 runs off Charlton Torrence in the
first inning, but was blanked from
then on to the wild ‘sixth. David-
son slugged Griffith and Baker for
10 runs by the sixth and it was this
rally in the sixth that gave the
game to Roger Baker, the reliefer.
Lefty Hunter relieved Torrence for
Davidson in the third inning.

The Wildcats’ combined 4 errors
by the Tigs and 9 hits including

triples by Hunter, Mapes, and Rice 4
‘and a homer by Auburn Lambeth

to collect the 11 runs, Meanwhile
Clemson used the first and sixth
innings, 9 walks, a double and a

homer by Culberson, and 10 hits
for the winning trick. Torrence and
Hunter combined for 8 strikeouts
while Clemson mancuvered only 5.

Bill Bird cotlected 2 hits for 5}

trips to the plate and Lefty Hunter
was perfect at the plate with a
triple for one trip to lead their
mates in batting honors. Koebel
with 3 for 3, Baker with 2 for 2,
and Culberson with his two long
hits led for the host club. Baker
was the winning pitcher and Tor-
rence is charged with the loss.

Outfielder Red Watson led the

cidentally a Greenville, S. C., Sen-
ior, smashed a triple and a single
to push across the same number of

as they slugged their way to a 29-5
victory over the hapless Campus

winners and erratic fielding of the
Campus Club combined to give the
Pikas their victory. Graham Smith
and Boyce Kendall were the pitch-
ers for the losers.

Jones 3 for 5, and White had 2

hurler struck out 19 and Ballard 2
to make a total of 21 strike outs.
The next night was more of a
