ene fall flowers

and Davidson’s Georgian
buildings, Henry Hope Reed

discusses his affinity for the Classical.

October 26, 1995

When you went to Harvard, were you
already interested in architecture?
No, actually my mind was a perfect
blank, or at least close to it.

So, what got you started?

It was actually sometime after college. I
had a very good friend who liked to go
and lookat old buildings, Win Andrews.
He has a number of books, mostly about
American architecture. We would ex-
plore — we actually came down here
together. It was an interesting little trip.
We went to Durham to see the Gothic
work of Horace Trumbauer, a great
Philidelphia architect. We also saw the
work of Andrew Jackson Davis, who
did the theater building at Chapel Hill.
He was a New Yorker who did Gothic
buildings — Gothic houses, one for the
famous financier, Gould. Gould has
been much denounced in our history
books. I think unfairly, now. He was not
liked by his peers because he was ruth-
less. He was also very competitive. He
was chief owner of Erie Railroads —
you could travel from New York to
Chicago for a dollar. That drove the
other. railroad entrepreneurs wild.
Andrews and I traveled a lot in New
York, particularly the Hudson River
valley. Andrews wanted to see all of the
revivals — Greek revival, Tuscan re-
vival: There is a lot of it; you know. I
also got into the Classical through an-
other friend of mine, John Barrington
Bayley, an architect who taught at
Harvard Architectural School and re-
jected the Modern school. I had the
good fortune of being in Rome when he
was there. He and I explored Rome
every single day and night.

Rome must be your Mecca.

It was. We saw a lot, inevitably. It was
not terribly long after the war. There
were hardly any cars — have you been
there?

Yes, and I found the cars to be the
scariest part of Italy.

There were no cars. We were a bit of a
novelty because then Americans were
not the omnipresence that they are to-
day. We sawa lot; we were priveledged.
Bayley was at the American Academy
in Rome on the G.I. Bill, and being there
opened doors. I grew so much. Later I
was in Paris studying French, and even-
tually things came together and I began
to write books.

Did you ever think about being an
architect?

No, it is enough of a struggle to be a
writer. Also, architecture takes such
work. You have to be fairly young. You
have to have independent means — or at
least it is a good idea to. So many

architects’ first commission is by so-
and-so junior for so-and-so senior. You
realize that their first commission was
funded by mom and pop.’ I got into
writing books. There was another man,
Christopher Tunnard. He was a profes-
sor at Yale. I assisted him on one book,
The City of Man, involving American
cities and towns, their planning and their
architecture. This book was about
American towns and why they look the
way that they do. My exploration of the
Hudson ‘River valley, going to Rich-
mond, and coming down here were all
things that could be used in the book.
We had a hardcover book, published as
a Mentor book. I’m not sure if they still
even have those today. Their chief pub-
lications were under Signet books, a line
for those books with some intellectual
pretention, all non-fiction. He and I co-
authored a hook, The American Skyline,
Writing with someone accomplished was
a satisfactory way to learn how to write.
He is a Modern, particularly in land-
scape architecture. Our books did sell
the edition. There may have been one or
two reprints. Most of the people that I
have met that have read [The American
Skyline] read it in college.

We actually have that book in our
library.

Do they have any other books of mine in
the library?

I believe that we also have The Golden

NO MODERN FOR ME

The controversial architectural critic Henry Hope Reed.

Brandon Clarke

Henry Hope Reed has been a contro-
versial figure in the art world for over
forty years. A Harvard graduate, he has
had various careers from writer to head of

Central Park. He is best known as a hater

of all Modern architecture, especially as
expressed in his 1959 book, The Golden
City.

Mr. Reed is currently working on
another book and lives in New York City.

succeeded. I would definitely put that
up there.

City.
Oh, they do? Well, you see, they are
learning.

This might be an unfair question to
ask, but do you have a favorite build-
ing?

Of course I do. The New York Public
Library is among the top. The U.S.
Capitol. :

But is there one that you think is
architecturally perfect?

Certain Roman buildings come to mind.
Ones that you enjoy seeing again and
again. The Pantheon. Also, thinking a
bit more locally, the San Francisco City
Hall, a stunning building. Make a point
to see it.

Do you have a least favorite building?
No, there are too many. Most Modern
architecture. Actually yes, yes Ido. The
present interior of Pennsylvania Station ©
in New York. How they could have

So often in Western art, movements
grow out of reaction to the last move-
ment — Baroque and Rococo, Ro-
manticism and Realism. We have
started to see some Classical elements
emerge in Postmodernism. Do you
think that the style will come full circle
and Classicism will make a come-
back?

There will be many obstacles to over-
come. For example the dealer, the col-
lectors and anybody who has a vested
interest. There are a lot that do. Let’s
say that you have a picture that sells for
a half a million dollars. If it goes out of
fashion the money won’t be there. It
won’t be aclear cut division in any case-
Modern today, Classical tomorrow.
Modern Architecture with the general
public has never been really popular.
The general public respects workman-

ship.

How would you improve this cam-
pus?

The first thing that I would do is plant
lots of flowers. I would have the whole
placecovered. See, someone has brought
in these urns [in front of Chambers]. I
would make the geraniums much more
elaborate. It would be a major attrac-
tion.

What would you do with Chambers?
Isuppose that I would use a more elabo-
rate order. I would change the Doric to
Corinthian because of the importance of
the building. I would have more treat-
ment around the windows, using stone.
The proportions of the building are all
right. The pediments are empty. I
would like to fill them with sculpture.
Also, there should be some sculpture
over, the central attic. Wherever pos-
sible I would have sculpture. Maybe
some obelisks at the base of the sides of
the central stairs of lesser buildings.
Anything more decorative. Urns, for
example. Also, any keystone must have
a mask on them — human, fish, lion.

Davidson sends a fair number of
people to architecture school. Do you
have any words of advice for an aspir-
ing architect?

Learn how to draw, and draw every-
thing.
