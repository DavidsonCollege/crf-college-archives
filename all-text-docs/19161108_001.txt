The DAVIDSONIAN

Vol. IV.

Another Victory Won
By Davidson Eleven

Farman Deleated at Greenville by
a Large Score.

‘The Varsity had a rather easy time
with Furman University at Greenville
Saturday and piled up nearly as big a
soure as last year against the much
touted South Carelinians. The Fur-
inan squad made things look pretty bad
during the firsr half. but in) the last
two periods the Red and Black machine
ran true to form and it was only a
question of how big a score the Varsity
would pile up. Davidson's defense
proved a little weak during the first
part of the game. bur from the time the
teferee’s whistle blew to the stare the
second half until the game was over,
the line held and charged their heavier
opponents off their feet, and the back-
field tore off gain after gain.

WALKER, HALP-BACK

Davidson registered her firse touch-
down soon after the game started. Off-
tackle plays and line bucks brought the
ball within striking distance and Kees-
ler on a fake ran 20 yards for a touch-
down. Furman rallied momentarily,
however, and on receiving the kick-off
marched down the field to Davidson’s
jo-yard line. Speer, who was one of
the mainstays for Furman, then com-
pleted a long forward pass to Woods
for Furman's first score. For the re-
mainder of the first half the honors
were about even. and each team added
another touchdown. Davidsen missing
goal and makiv-g the count 14 to 13 in
favor af the Greenvilleites.

In the third ovarter Davidson came
hack strong and literally plaved rings
around Furman for the remainder of
the game. adding four touchdowns in
the third period and one in the last.
After the second quarter Furman never
threatened to score.

the Juniors defeated the Seniors Wed-
nesday night by a score uf 22 to 17.

Both sides plaved very poor baske’
ball during the first half. The formid
able offense formerly displaved by the
Seniors was lacking, and they let sev
eral good opportuniti¢s to score pass, al-
tho they managed to hold the big ‘end
of a 10 to 8 score at the end of the first
period.

The Juniors took the offensive at the
beginning of the second half and literally
played the fourth year men off their feet.
Hawkins plaved very good ball for the
Juniors, with a record of seven field
goals and two fouls. Sprant also plaved.
a good game. Murray played the best
game for the Seniors.
