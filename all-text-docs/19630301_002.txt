A Goal Of Self-Criticism

We await with some eagerness
the publication of the report of the
faculty-trustee committee on the aims
of Davidson College. In anticipation
of it, we would like to make a few ob-
servations of our own.

Davidson, we think, is sincerely
trying to define its aims and move
toward them. In the academic world,
Davidson aspires to be rated among
the finest small colleges of the coun-—
try. In the religious realm, the college
seeks to instill an intelligent Christian
faith in its students. We also hear that
Davidson hones to educate the “whole
man.”

How do these aspirations compare
with realty? Davidson already enjoys
a surprisingly high reputation, but it
has by no means secured its place a-
mong the first-rate colleges of the
country. The college requires certain
religious functions of its students, but
for many, these have become merely
bothersome exercises. The cult of the
“whole man” often has been reduced
to a cover-up for the shortage of intel-
lectual curiosity and __ scholastic
achievement in the college.

We sense a very real tension at
Davidson these days. On one side we
see those who are dedicated to the
task of pulling Davidson up onto a
new and higher plane, constantly
pressing for the fulfillment of its
lofty ambitions. President Martin and
Dr. Richards have been especially ac-
tive in not letting Davidson lose
sight of its announced. aims.

On the other side, however, we
sense a popular devotion to dead
weight and inertia. We often get the
feeling that a great many students,
faculty members, and even trustees,
do not share the view that Davidson
needs to set its aim so high. This is a
consistently silent but nonetheless
very powerful pressure on the college
to be content at playing the role of a
collegiate prep school. They would
never deny Davidson's ideals, but they
would keep them in the form of a pie
in the sky which is better saved than
eaten. They find the real purpose of
the college in the production of in-
telligently mediocre youth to fill the
upper-middle class niches which are

so feadily available to Davidson grad-
uates.

We are encouraged by the changes
which have come in spite of this op-
position, for many of them are signifi-
cant. But we often feel frustrated by
the slowness and pain which is always
involved in their achievement. We
live in an era swept away with rapid
change, and we are still uncertain of
Davidson's velocity.

We say velocity, for we are not
only unsure of the speed, but also of
the direction. We think numerous
questions need to be seriously con-
sidered.

Is the idea of a church-related
liberal arts college a product of some
out-moded Protestant scholasticism?
Can Davidson achieve academic excel-
lence without severing ‘its ties to the
church, and vice versa?

What is meant by Davidson’s
“Christian witness"? How _ does
an educational institution witness?
Through its ideals? Through its stud-
ents? Through the achievements and
failures of its alumni? How is David-
son now witnessing, and to Whom?
Or is this simplv another sugar plum
for the pie in the sky?

What changes - does Davidson
most need to improve its academic
witness? How do the claims for an ex-
panded Union and for college-financ-
ed facilities on Lake Norman stack up
against the pleas for a better library
and improved faculty salaries?

Davidson faces an awesome chal-
lenge—the challenge of fitting man’s
unending quest for knowledge and
truth into the Christian faith. This
has been an enigma for all Christian
education since the time of Christ.

We submit these thoughts in the.

hope that they will be pondered. We
are. glad to see the faculty and trustees
working together on this committee,
and we hope that the publication of
their report will serve as a stimulus
to further discussion and exchange
between interested trustees, faculty,
administration, and students.

We have just begun to cast our
eyes about. There is much that re-
mains to be seen.

JKA

Actively Elect An Active Council

Four years ago the Student Coun-
cil was relieved of its toilsome judi-
cial duties by the formation of the
Honor Court. The council declared it-
self liberated for greater tasks. and
pledged to lead Davidson student gov-
ernment into new and richer pastures.

But due to the hard facts of
Davidson politics, the council has
tended to serve as the voice for stud-
ent complaints. Certainly it has been
the instrument for getting certain
rules changed, and has even joined the
NSA, in case you haven't heard. But
it has done so as quietly as possible,
and has declined to involve itself or
the student body in any of the con-
traversy on which NSA thrives.

The council has done a satisfac-
tory job in effectively mirroring stud-
ent opinion, but we hesitate to call
this dynamic leadership. The old well
of issues has about gone dry after all
these years. We are barely left with
the drinking rule and a few parking

regulations to bicker about.

We express the hope that this
year’s elections will produce a coun-
cil which will explore the greater
issues facing students and the college
as a whole. We would further wish to
see a council elected which would
actively participate—or refuse to par-
ticipate—in the NSA. We would like
to have a council which would carry
through the old promises of public
forums and debates on significant
and topical questions.

Davidson students have all stud-
ied ROTC. They are therefore unique-
ly equipped to recognize the qualities
of a leader. We hope that they will
not hold these qualities against any
candidate who might possess them.
The fact that Davidson’s elections con-
sistently produce the unexpected may
prove our hopes to be not wholly vain.

At any rate, join the minority and

vote.

A Sickness Of The Whole

Recently two essential programs
on this campus have shown dangerous
symptoms of fading into extinction.
Both drama and debate have issued
calls for support that must not go un-
heeded.

In dramatics the problem ap.
pears alleviated somewhat by the for-
mation of the new governing board.
But organization is no cure-all. Dr.
Goodykoontz has pointed out needs
that can only be met by more coopera-
tion from both the students and ad-
ministration. Good intentions are sim-
ply not enough.

We frankly support Dr. Drake’s
suggestion of getting a professional.
debate coach. The plight of the Vaga-
bonds has shown clearly enough that
one-man programs, especially when

that man has an academic load, will
always run under a handicap. Again
student support is needed (How many
time does this need to be repearted?).
It is appalling to think that right now
many high schools have more active
programs of debate than Davidson
College.

The problems are small but they
are many. And whether they have just
been missed or purposely set aside is
not to the point. They are present and
smarting like open wounds. The
smart, the pain should serve as ade-
quate warning in a healthy body.

If we are to set our sights on
higher goals, we should remember
that only as a healthy body will we
reach them.

“

Davidson ‘Best Of Type’
But is This Goal Valid?

BY WALT MacDONALD

'“Our goal is to make Davidson
the best college. of its type—not
just in the South, but in all of
America.” These apparently
commendable words of Presi-
dent D. Grier Martin may be
found in the brochure printed
by the college to celebrate our
125th anniversary last year.

At another time, Martin de-
fined Davidson's “type” of col-
lege as “a Wberal arts, church-
related college for about 1.000
men” for the Winston-Salem
Twin City Sentinel.

College Enrott
Davidson 1005
Sewanee 658
Hampden-Sidney 505
St. Vincent 747
Wofford 833
Bellarmine (Ky.) 1441

If it is really Davidson’s goal
to be the best of this “type”,
the time to stop struggling has
arrived. The millenrium is upon
us.

A comparison of Davidson
with the 33 colleges and univer-
sities across the nation that fall
under this heading should satis-
fy anyone that Davidson is
either in first place or at least
tied for that position.

To establish beyond a doubt
which colleges fulfill these
necessary qualifications — (1)
enrollment under 2000. (2)
church related, (3) for men—
both The College Blue Book and
The World Almanac for 1962
were consulted. It is interesting
to note that 27 of the 34 col-
leges in this group are related
to the Catholic Church, three
are Presbyterian.

The criteria used for compari-
son among this Umited number
of schools are those normally
used by colleges to indicate
three things: (1) the quality of
the student accepted, (2) the
quality of the education offered,

The jeering mob, a manager's
anxiety, and the sticky odor of
old canvas blend in a blue haze
of cigar smoke while you try
to focus on the rhythmical
count from the referee above
you. Only a heavy music score
and screen credits reminds us
that we are part of an audience
viewing what proves to be a
superb movie.

This initial sequence with its
first-person use of the camera
quickly establishes the atmos-
phere and effectively begins the
plot of next week's feature,
REQUIEM FOR A HEAVY-
WEIGHT. You will fail to enjoy
the remainder of this movie
only if you dislike its subject
type—a realistic portrait of a
heroic but limited character in
a desperately narrow and ulti-
mately inescapable  environ-

‘Requiem’: Tough,
Grim And Heroic

and (3) the quality of the pro
duct.

Other methods of gauging the
strength of an educational in-
stitution are perhaps possible.
The statistics used for this
study are those readily avail-
able from most colleges. These
are the measurements used by
the colleges themselves in their
propaganda disseminated to
prospective students and other
interested parties.

One major statistic measures
the relative abilities of entering
classes. This is the average of

(3) Twenty-seven other col-
leges, ranging from St. Anselm's
College, Manchester, N.H. to
Wofford College, Spartanburg,
S.C.

the Verbal and Math scores of
the Scholastic Aptitute Test ad-
ministered by the College
Board. To discover how heated
the competition is to enter an
institution, and thus how selec-
tive an admissions department
can be, the total number of
completed applications is com-
pared to number enrolled in
the freshman class.

The quality of education of-
f red is measured by four fac-
tors: (1) the ratio of number of
faculty members to number of
students; (2) the percentage of
faculty members holding the
PhD; (3) the number of volumes
in the college library; (4) num-
ber of major fields of study.

The quality of the product
can in part be measured by the
percentage of graduating seniors
going on to graduate school, and
also by the percentage of grad-
uates receiving graduate fellow-
ships and other such awards.

A close comparison of the 34
schools in the predefined group
quickly results in a breakdown
into three groups:

(1) Davidson and The Univer-

ment.

After the credits, the film’s
excellence lies in the screen-
play and the acting perform-
ances of Anthony Quinn,
Mickey Rooney, Jackie Glea-
son, and Julie Harris (in that
order).

Serling’s screenplay for the
movie is a translation of the
award-winning television script
for the film medium. It con-
cerns Mountain Rivera, too-late
contender for the heavyweight
championship after fourteen
years of boxing, and his empty,
helpless search for purpose out-
side of the ring.

The people and incidents are
so real that they risk being
stereotyped, but REQUIEM FOR
A HEAVYWEIGHT is fresh and
vivid to the point of originality.

this page contains the relevant
statistics from two colleges of
each group. While a delineation
between. schools occasionally in
groups one and two is impossi-
ble, on the basis on one or two
isolated statistics the overall
distinction seems to be justified
after a comparison of all statis-
tics. Between groups one and
three there is no such problem.
The only statistic in which Dav-
.idson was noticeably often sur-
passed by these so-called infer-
ior schools was in number of
volumes in the library.

Comparing Davidson with Se-
wanee leaves one with no clear-
cut decision as to which can be
proclaimed “the best”. Not>

Davidson does lead when
graduate fellowships received
are compared.

Davidson has produced 29
winners of Woodrow Wilson fel-
lowships, its Episcopal neighbor
25 from 1954 to April 196).
Davidson ranks 8th nationally in
number of Danforth scholar-
ships received, Sewanee lower
than 25th. Davidson. ranks 4th
nationally in number of Rocke.
feller Brothers fellowships, Se-
wanee about 21st in a tie with a
large number of other schools.
But Davidson and Sewanee are
tied for 7th place nationally in
percentage of graduates re-
ceiving Rhodes scholarships.

But the indeterminate answer

to whether Davidson or Sewanee
is the Dest small liberal arts
church-related college for men
is not a valid question for de-
bate. Rather, the really vital
question is to determine how
Davidson ranks among the liber-
al arts colleges for men in
America, period.
_ Removing the restriction
“church-related” and ignoring
the limitation of 2,000 students
as an excuse for second-rate
education leaves Davidson and
her brothers-in-the-Church bare

institutions such as Ambherst,
Wesleyan, Dartmouth, Williams,
ete. The list is long.

DAVIDSONIAN will run a ser-
ies exploring the specific steps

least start itself on its way to

league institutions with which

Carrell Denies ‘Censure’

Of Faculty In

BY DANNY CARRELL
Student Body President

Last week's DAVIDSONIAN
accused me of “censuring” the
faculty’s recent decision regard-
ing fraternity functions. The
word “censure” carries an un-
desirable connotation, and I be-
lieve that the use of it was un-
fortunate.

The writer of the article came
to me and asked if I had re-
quested the rule change. He said
that he had been told by Dean
R. C. Burts and Gus Burgdorf
that I had requested the change.
I was a bit upset when I heard
this, but I later found out that

the Dean and his assistant had
stated that the change came a-
bout as a result of the discus-
sions that Larry Leafer and I
had with the Faculty Committee
on Social Life last January. This
is true; however, I do not know
why the change was made.

Larry and I met. with the com-
mittee to present a Student
Council request to abolish the
off-campus drinking rule. In the
course of the discussion, I men-
tioned that I personally ques-
tioned the necessity for having
a connected rule—the fraterni-
ty function rule—on the books.

No vote had been taken on
this matter by the Student
Counell, and so no formal re-
quest was made. | was merely
stating something that |
thought wes obvious—that al-
though the off-campus drink-
ing rule is upheld in some in-
stances, the fraternity func-
tion rule is obselete.

In regard to the change made
to the fraternity function rule, I
should like to point out that I
was mainly surprised over the
change—surprised, because the
change will have no effect what-
soever. The change makes it
possible to have any number of
offcampus fraternity functions
rather than restricting the num-
ber to one a semester as the

Rule Change

old rule had done.

However, the functions must
still be chaperoned and alcohol-
free. In the past, fraternities
have ignored the rule because
they knew that it was not going
to be enforced. They will con-
tinue to ignore the modified

rule.

The only way for the rule to
be enforced is for the faculty
to act as a police force. I can
visualize the consequences.
Many fraternities would contin-
ue to have after-dance parties,
but they would be extremely
eateful to conceal the location
of these parties from the police
force.

Others would perhaps be
afraid of the consequences of
a raid and would join their
brothers at U. Va., North
Carotina, and other schols.
Then instead of driving back
from parties 1-20 miles from
campus at 5 in the morning,
fraternity men could drive
100 mifes or more or simply
leave fer the weekend and
boycott any organized social

events on the Davidson cam-
pus, such as concerts or
dances.

I am not content with the
status quo of the off-campus
drinking situation. The ideal
compromise would be to elimin-
ate the fraternity function rule
and to continue to control drink-
ing at off-campus events spon-
sored financially by Davidson
College.

Fraternity after parties would
then be legal and the off-cam-
pus drinking rule would be en-
forceable most of the time. Such
a proposal will not be realized
this year and probably not next
year or any year in the foresee-
able future, but I am convinced
that it would solve a lot of prob-
lems and end a great deal of
controversy.

Perhaps Davidson should be-
gin to worry more about the
academic life of its students and
let them handle their own
morals.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Stewart Hits Story
On Freshman Council

Dear Editor:

In the February 22nd issue of
THE DAVIDSONIAN it was
“Noted in Passing,” that; “It
was interesting to note how fast
the Freshman Council dropped
the idea of making formal criti-
cism of the Union's food service
as soon as the second semester
began. Sounds as if someone put
a pill of forgetfulness in the
fraternity gravy.”

The Freshman Council did not
drop any formal criticism in the
sense that the article implies..A
committee, with an equal nuny ;
ber of independents and frater.
nity freshmen, was fermed to
see what could be done about
the conditions in the cafeteria,
specifically such things as dirty
tables and broken glass, and, if
possible, to see ‘if any thing
could be done about the quality
of the food.

They worked with the Union
Cafeteria Committee on this
project rather than placing a
formal complaint (as is common-
ly done by THE DAVIDSON-
1AN). The Union Cafeteria Com-
mittee promised better condi-
tions and was glad to know that
the Freshman Council was con-
cerned. The conditions in the
cafeteria improved before the
first semester was over. The

BUSINESS...

quality of the cafeteria food was
out of the hands of the Fresh-
man Council.

This matter might seem triv-
ial but THE DAVIDSONIAN
chose to distort it and form in-
valid conclusions from the
event: The phrase, “pills of for-
getfulness,” is almost good but
it will have to be used in a
truthful article.

Dear Editor:

.-! Sickening is the “good part of
the story,” relating Dr. Wendell
M. Stanley’s comments on the
distribution of a cancer-produc-
ing polio vaccine to twenty mil-
Mon Russians. This compas-
sionateless discourse was re-
ported by a feature writer on
page one of the February 22nd
issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN.

I did not attend this Reynolds
lecture. Perhaps Dr. Stanley’s
face was twisted when he spoke
“wryly” of our State Depart-
ment’s “sabotage.” Maybe there
were some “Red haters” in the
audience who giggled at the
idea of slow death.

Your article deserves to be
circulated and interpreted,
say, by the New Yorker.
