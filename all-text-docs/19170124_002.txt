A few Juniors are beginning to wear
a slightly puzzled look already.

Headline in ‘Tux Davinsonran a
year ago: Ground to be Broken for
the Gymnasium Soon.

We wonder why .those _ stationary
hurdles have been erected around the
edges of the grass.

Would it be a good idea to put Junior
Speaking up a week so it would not con-
flict with the Inaguration?

The foundations of the new tank are
concrete examples of Davidson efficiency.

I. H. Patterson is convalescing and
is almost himself again. Yesterday he
wrote, it is reported, an 118-page Iet-
ter to his girl.

We still contend that the twelve
short, Crowded tennis courts could be
made first-class courts by moving the
hackstops a few feet.

What if:

The War hadn't begun.

And we were not broke.

And the Gymnasium were built.

And Liston were to stop talking.

And Pope were to get in a hurry.

And Lavender Thomas were to lose
some flesh.

And the Commissary were to make
only 50 per cent profits.

And lights were put in the dormitory
halls. ‘

And the Literary Societies were to
have an interesting meeting.

And the Sophs were to win the Class
fonthall championship.

The editors feel that the fact that the
present issue is, and the following few
issues will be, only four pages in length.
needs not an apology but an explanation.
The explanation is simply this: there is
a slack of news and happenings, and
dearth of interesting material. Readers.

to cover territory. No apology is due,
for readers are paying the same subscrip
tion price as was paid last year for only
four-page issues,

Is class football a good thing? The
question has been raised. Certainly it
has its defects. Jt takes time and a lot
of'it, not only that of the coaches, who
spend hours trying to beat a little foot-
hall knowledge into a bunch of seem-
‘ng numskulls. but, too, the time of the
same numskulls, who spend the same
hours, running. perspiring and falling
on a muddy field. More than that.
more men are usually hurt in class foot-
ball than in Varsity even. And, as a
result of damp weather and wet fields,
the sick list reaches its climax.

But the henefits. First it affords
oleasure and diversion to the whole stu-
dent body, without which in this gloomy
weather and in these halls. gloomy com-
pared with home, would undoubtedly
die of blues. Then it causes class spirit
as nothing else does, and clhss spirit is a
vood thing, for from it mo the pep
of the campus is born. And then from
class foothall men come next year’s
scrubs. It is a kindergarten of football
knowledge.

So long live class football, and may
the hest class win.

Editor Davidsonian:

During President Wilson’s visit to
the College last Spring it was quite
noticeable to the writer, and also a mat-
ter of comment to others, that the Na-
tional ensign was not flown, and for the
very good reason that the College had
neither a flag nor a flay pole at which
to display the colors. During the visit
of Secretary Josephus Daniels three
years ago, I heard the same comment
made by some visitors from an adjoining
State. The students of Davidson Col-
lege are largely descendants of men who
made Star Spangled Banner the flag of
the greatest nation of the world, and it
is certainly our duty to keep the patriot-
ism of our student body at a high pitch.

Sometimes T think that we of David-
son are a bit provincial in our attitude
towards certain things, and we have re-
acted so much towards symbolism that
we have taken most of the sentiment out
of our love of country by not paying
enough attention to the symbols of pa-
triotism. There is no question of the
fact that a flag is a real symbol, and
men die in defense of their symbols
every day, and this attitude is made
much of in military and naval life. It
would seem almost an impossible state
of affairs to a man in service to see a
large group of buildings housing four
hundred young men without a flag staff
or flag.

T have been hoping that some clas<
would give us a good flag pole for the
campus and that the colors might be
flown at least on national holidays and
when we have any noted officials present.

Tf anv organization will give a suit-
able staff for the campus, I have in
hands about $35.00 with which to buy
the flag, and will be glad to put it to

that use. This money was given to me
by a patriotic citizen—not an alumnus] uJ

of Davidson or citizen of this State, but

ane who wants to see our young men|{
have the national ensign floating over|

their college. .

HE fact that 75% of our business comes over the
phone and by mail, without quotation, argues well
of the confidence placed in us by our patrons.
The fact that we seldom lose a customer indicates
that their confidence is not misplaced.

If you have not yet placed this confidence in us,
we can assure you your experience will be the same

as those who have—SATISFIED.
