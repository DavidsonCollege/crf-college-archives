Dr. John Williamson of the Biology department reveals a little -
known aspcct of his personality, his green thumb.

Williamson Disproves
His Tqugh Image

By BENNETT WATERS:

“Big, intimidating, mean and
tough” is how Dr. John William-
son thinks he is vicwed by others.
However, many fail to sce the real
person underneath the brazen ex-
tcrior. In reality, he is about as far
from big and mean as he can be.
The intimidation students feel in
his presence probably comes from
the talk of others. His toughness,
however, is genuine.

Williamson grew up in Clark-
ton, N.C., and at age thirtecn
worked as a sharecropper on a
tcnant farm to help pay the bills.
Aftcr high school, he reccived a
Bachclor of Science in Agricul-
ture from North Carolina State Uni-
versity. After college, he earned
his Masters degrce at Cornell, and
later a Doctorate in Zoology at
Gcorgia. He has since done post-
doctoral work at Oak Ridge and
the University of California at
Riverside.

Williamson joined the
Davidson biology department in
1981 after twelve years at the
University of Calgary. William-
son says he “always had an interest
in a small college with some qual-
ity and more importantly, good
students.” In the back of his mind
was a desire to return to North
Carolina,and Davidson offered the
opportunity for all of these.

Williamson’s field of specialty
is genetics, and he has worked
extensively with drosophilia fruit
flies. His research timeat Davidson
is limited, buthe uses his summers
to continue his experiments.

If there is, one problem Wil-
liamson has, it’s his image. Most
students only see or hear of him,

and he thinks that the students who
talk about his “meanness” are ci-
ther pcople who have never had
him, or.people that haven’t both-
ered to get to know him.

When asked if he was really:
big, intimidating, mcan and tough,
Williamson: laughed and replicd:
“Not at all. I really don’t under-
stand it. I’m the most helpful guy
on campus. I think if I were 5’8" I
wouldn’thave that reputation.” He
was told recently thata large group
of people were debating what God
would look like if He appeared.
Williamson langhed, and said, “I
won!”

Perhaps the mostunknown side
of Williamson is his grecn thumb:
He says it’s “a hobby that’s gotten
out of hand.” Williamson raiscs
over 650. different varictics of
azalcas alonc. He says that the
“physical, mental and social ther-
apy” is whathccnjoys most. “After
working from 7:45 a.m. until 6:00
p.m: at night every day, I need
some timegway from people.”

I asked Williamson to pick
three words that describe him
clearly. He replied, “industrious,
positive and..demanding.” When
asked to describe himsclf as a
breakfast cereal, Williamsonchose
40% Bran Flakcs. “I’ve been cat-
ing them for years, and thcy’ve
been the same all the time. They
have a strength of character and a
consistency that I like.”

Davidson was apparently the
right career choice for William-
son. “When I sitdown at night, and
I’m tired, I think...and I’m happy.
It’s almost scary to be this com-
fortable. I’ve never becn happicr

4 Cross- -Country for a Cause

By ELIZABETH HOWE

Two Davidson students, jun-
ior Carol Hancock and sophomore
Carlton Craig,““saw America” this
summer. However, they didn’t
exactly do this in a slow, relaxed
manner. Instead, Hancock and
Craig biked approximately 3,600
miles across the country, and they
did it within the space of nine
weeks.

These two Davidson students
participated in Bike Aid, a fund-
raiser sponsored by the Overseas
Development Network (ODN),
which is a student-run organiza-
tion based in San Francisco, Cali-
fornia. The ODN accepts propos-
als for small, self-help develop-
ment projects to be implemented
at the grass-roots level both in the
United States and in nations of the
Third World. These proposals are
submittcd by people who actually
reside in the areas necding assis-
tance. As Craig commented, “the

‘community knows what it needs
best.”

The ODN does not provide
relief in the form of food or mone-
tary aid to these communities;

‘instead, it sends personnel and

materials to the areas in need so
that the people living there can
learn skills that will help them
become more actively involved in
promoting the developmentof their
community.

Hancock and Craig first heard
of Bike Aid through Craig’s
brother, David, who attends Wake
Forest University. They joined with
117 other people who were inter-
ested in this program; and on June
20, they set off from Portland, Ore-
gon, the starting point on their
cross-country route.

They averaged riding 75 miles
per day on their trck, with Hancock
going as faras 113 milesand Craig
going as far as 130 milcs in one
day. Their group stopped atalmost
evcry town it reached, even ones
with populations as small as ten

people.
Along the way from Portland

to Washington, D.C., their final
destination, Hancock and Craig’s
group of 22 bikers stopped once a
week for a “rest day.” On these
days, the group would workall day
on one or more service projects.
For example, they painted a

children. They also worked with
the U.S. Forestry Service in
Jackson, Wyoming, to rebuild
mountain bike trails.

". This helped the Forestry Serv-
ice obtain a federal grant. In addi-
tion, the group stayed on a Sioux
Indian reservation in South Da-
kota, which is plagued with 80
percent unemployment. This
community is considered the most
violent Indian reservation in the
United States.

Though the ride across the

nation was oftcn grucling for the
bikers, Carol asserted that “the first

week of biking was the toughest.”
They biked across both the Rocky
and Appalachian Mountains, and
they rode for six miles ona stretch
that was 10 percent grade, which
Hancock and Craig both agreed
was extremely difficult.

They also agreed that the
downhill portions of the trip were
exhilarating. While riding down
the Teton Pass, for example, Craig
attained a speed of 51.5 miles per
hour.

On August 21, when other
Davidson students were attending

~ their first classes of the fall term,

Hancock and Craig and the rest of
their group reached Washington,
D.C. after having ridden for 63
Straight days. While they admittcd
that there were a few minor prob-
lems along the way, both Hancock
and-Craig found their involve-
ment to be extremely rewarding.

“You learn a whole lot about
yourself” while working with a
diverse group of people devoted to
a “common cause,” said Craig.
Hancock added that she discov-
ered thatshe could “really dosome-
thing significant for other people”
and “help alotof pooplein the long
run” through Bike Aid.

Aid should contact Hancock at -

New Vagabonds Student Group
Boosts Theater Awareness

By KATE DUNLOP

Founded by Professor of Thea-
ter Rupert Barber to “bolster and
supportadditional opportunites for
theater participation and experi-
ence to the campus,” the New
Vagabonds is a new theater group
on campus this year.

For the past month, thirteen
interested students have bcen

to organize the basic plan for

membership, officers andcommit=~

tec structure. After Fall Break, the

“group will have a general meeting

for all interested students. Soon

after, on October 15 and 16, audi-
tions will be held for “Loot”, the
British dark comedy that the New
Vagabonds is sponsoring. Audi-
tions are open to all students, anda
copy of the script is on reserve in
the library for those interested,

“The core of the organization
will basically be in the community
structure,” said Barber. “Hopefully
in the near future, the New Vaga-
bonds will be almost all student-
run and produced.” The theater
group plans to offer opportunities
for students to participate in all
aspects of the theater, including
acting, directing, writing plays, and
theater management.

To encourage busy students to
become involved, most studio
theater productions will be short-
term, spanning no morc than three
wecks. Students will be required to
commit to a certain job for only
one project at a time,

Because of the limited facili-
ties for theater at Davidson, the
New Vagabonds was also founded
with the intention of doing theater
that could be produced in innova-
live spaces. “We want to expcri-
ment with space and different lo-”
cations. Right now, “Loot” is
