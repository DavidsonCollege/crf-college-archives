A Guiding Hand

A recent issue of “Moderator”
points out in its own rather over-
simplified style the development of a
more personalized “live and let live”
ethic on the nation’s campuses.

Such an ethic stems first from the
feeling on the part of students that
they have certain rights to engage in
whatever activities they wish ‘‘as long
as they do so privately and peaceful-
ly.” Thus as long as no one is hurt
and no one’s rights are infringed
upon, everyone, especially the college
administration, should live and let live.

This is not a new idea, but today
the concept of non-interference by a
college or university in the private
lives of its students is becoming a well-
publicized issue. Students are demand-
ing greater freedom in their use of
drugs. their sexual relationships, and
their academic requirements.

In the places where these demands
are being met, the college or univer-
sity has all but disengaged itself from
any responsibility for a student’s acti-
vities outside the curriculum.

At the other extreme are colleges
practicing the philosophy of in loco
parentis, that is, that the college acts
with an authority exercised in the
place of parents. Such a college is Da-
vidson. In subscribing to this idea, Da-
vidson has maintained regulations
punishing drinking, having women in
the dorms, gambling and other of-
fences despite traditional opposition
from various student groups.

The inherent fallacies in the in loco
parentis argument have been aptly
demonstrated. The college may not
assume the power to remove a student
from Davidson for such an offense as
drinking any more than a parent can
be allowed to disown a child if his is
found under the influence of alcohol.
And who can say if Davidson is follow-
ing the true wishes of a student’s par-
ents by suspending him or otherwise
punishing him severely? In other
words the. college is assuming a very

questionable base of authority for
many of its present rules.

Various alternatives have been of-
fered to replace the idea. The fiduc-
iary role of a college toward students
is one such alternative.

In this relationship, the college acts
for the benefit of its students once the
confidence or interest of the student
has been placed with the college. Such
a position on the part of the college,
however, should not imply that the col-
lege has the right to impose its own
peculiar patterns of conduct on the
student.

Instead it has a responsibility to
protect the student's interests from
being infringed upon by others. It
also has the responsibility of artieulat-
ing its own positions through its state-
ment of purpose and its curricular and
extra-curricular program.

The fiduciary concept, therefore,
emphasizes guidance but not force.
The college has a responsibility to
make clear its position on the drink-
ing issue, and it should protect stu-
dents from the abuse of drinking, but
it should not assume the right of en-
forcing a rigid moral code.

If the college is so sure of itself in
its concepts of morality, why does it
not extend this into the academic
realm? Before each course it could dis-
tribute copies of what it considers to
be the answers to everything and thus
eliminate intellectual fluctuation from
its norm also. .

In other words, if the college is to
emphasize the traditional liberal ap-
proach te academics, its rules on stu-
dent conduct should agree with this
concept. The fiduciary role of the
college proves its concern without di-
rectly assuming the student’s inability
to act responsibly. It alone can pro-
mote the kind of atmosphere at David-
son in which the student may look
upon the college's rules as a means
of his protection rather than his re-
pression.

Survival Training

The faculty made the right decision
Tuesday in deciding to delay its final
decision on the fate of ROTC until
the Professor of Military Science Col.
Fredrick W. Outlaw could be present
to defend his program. ;

In the light of his honest attempts
to improve the ROTC program here
over the past several years, it was the
only fair thing to do.

There is a definite moral problem
for a Christian school that supports an
ROTC program, the end goal of which
is teaching men to kill or teaching
men to aid the killing.

But, looking at the problem from a
safe, cowardly, rationalized viewpoint,
the program is valuable for helping
students avoid the long arms of their
draft boards and giving them the
chance to kill as officers instead of as
privates.

The issue then is not one of throw-
ing ROTC off the campus but is in-
stead one of whether the program
should be compulsory and whether it
should be given academic credit.

The issue of the desirability of com-
pulsory participation has been rather
well settled by the Blue Sky recom-
mendation that no course should be

Ask And Get

One of the things that is becoming
apparent about the Blue Sky Comimit-
tee recommendations is that their im-
plementation may well mean little
more than a calendar readjustment
for some departments.

This is not necessarily a bad thing.
In some areas little would be gained
by throwing out the old program com-
pletely in favor of a new one.

But it is especially in these cases
that faculty members are going to
have to face up to the fact that some
of their courses just are not being
taught in a way that is consistent with
the ideals of a Blue Sky curriculum.

This does not mean that the courses
are just boring. Some of the courses
do fall into this category, and they
should be revitalized. If a student is
only to be taking two or three courses
per term, it is a waste of everybody’s
time for him to not be stimulated to
use this, increased time on his academ-
ic work. Students will simply not do
this if the course is boring.

But neither will they work hard if
little is demanded of them. There are
few courses now in which a student
can get a high grade without hard
work and real interest.

On the other hand there are a num-
ber of courses for which a “gentle-
man’s ‘C’ “ will be given without the
student having to contribute much to

compulsory. Those familiar with the
hand-out grading system of the pro-
gram can give the best evidence that
it certainly does not deserve the sort
of credit that is given for academic
courses here.

The best justification that can be
given for maintaining either of these
aspects of the present program is the
argument that the army cannot main-
tain its program unless it can offer
these two incentives, ie. that one
must take the course and that academ-
ic credit is given.

On the other hand, examples can
be cited of schools that do not require
participation and which still have
ROTC programs. While we do not
know of any schools which maintain
the course and do not give academic
credit, there are many examples of
strong extra-curricular programs that
are not able to offer any academic or
monetary incentive to attract partici-
pation.

Therefore, we believe that ROTC
could survive voluntary participation,
and it could survive extra-curricular
status. Both conditions would be more
appropriate to the aims and benefits
of the program and of the college.

the class at all.

Some Sigma Chi’s last year made up
a “Who’s Nothing Schedule” to com-
memorate the tapping ceremony for
this worthy Davidson honorary. The
complete four-year schedule that was
produced could have graduated a stu-
dent with a maximum of about five
hours work outside class each week.

It is very desirable for students to
have the time to attend extra-curricu-
lar lectures, concerts, etc. It is desir-
able for them to have the time to shoot
basketball down at the gym, to talk
with one another, to just be alone
and think. But it is only reasonable to
expect that academic subjects should
take some time, time that could be
gladly spent on an interesting course.

Professors argue that it is wrong
to put the blame on them for not mak-
ing their courses more demanding be-
cause they say students are not will-
ing to do the work. The answer to this,
of. course, is simply that few people
are going to take an interest in some-
thing that does not expect them to be
interested in it.

If a faculty member does little more
each year than just dust off his old
notebook, he can hardly expect any-
one to be really interested in his drivel.
And if he demands nothing of stu-
dents, that is just what he can expect
to get in many cases.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
‘Why War?’ Criticism
Not Just, Sterrett Says

Dear Editor,

The criticism leveled
against B. A. Aiken and the
“Why War?" program in
general is most unfair.

To begin with, many per-
sons do not understand the
nature of the program which
they criticize. There are on
campus various individuals
and groups which have some
reservations as to the practi-
cality and the moral validity
of war in modern times.

The ‘‘Why War?” program
has sought to act as a clear-
ing house by combining sep-
arate ideas into a _ unified
program. As such. it has four
goals.

First, it seeks to explore
the nature of modern war
fare through fectures and
discussions on thermonuclear.
chemical. and biological war--
fare. Secondly, it: seeks to
explore aspects of war other
than. military. i.e.. the eco
nomics and politics of war
and peace.

Third. it attempts to ex
plore mora! and practical al
ternatives to war and io as
whether such alternatives are
feasible. Fourth. it seeks both
to promote dialogue on alter-
natives to war and to raise
questions for individuals to
think about in regard to their
personal beliefs.

Aiken has acted as chair-
man of the planning commit-
tee. By no means are the
ideas in the program his

WASHINGTON, D. C. —
The “Saigon Post’ of Oct. 21
printed a letter written by a
Vietnamese citizen to US.
Ambassador Ellsworth Bun-
ker.

The letter reads:

“Dear Ambassador Bunker,

“On several occasions I
have written Your Excellency
on my case about the accrued
rentals of the Capitol Hotel
located at 107-A Dong Khanh
Boulevard, Cholon (Chinese
section of Saigon). And on
each case, your aides merely
give me the assurances that
the appropriate office will be
contacted for action. How-
ever, these promises, up to
this writing, have remained
mere words to the disadvan-
tage and hardship of my
famnily.”’

alone. The program is not an
attempt on his part to con.
vert humanity to his beliefs
on conscientious objection.

Rather, he has acted in his
official. capacity as president
of the College Union Board in
organizing a program. He has
brought individuals and their
ideas together and has work-
ed with the YMCA and Stu-
dent Council to sponsor the
program in a unified manner.

B. A. has his views, and
yes. the program is slanted.
What do you expect? The per-
sons responsible for the pro-
gram care about the subject
matter.

And persons who care about
things tend to have definite
opinions on those things. It is
only natural that such per-
sons present a slanted pro.
gram rather than a neutral
program. ,

Why shouid it be otherwise?
However, the presentation of
a slanted program should not
hinder dialogue: it should
serve. only to provoke dia-
logue.

Those who are sponsoring
the program have reserva-
tions about war. and feel that
the program deals with rele-
vant issues. Those who sup-
port war or find it necessary
or inevitable are fnvited to
sit down and discuss the mat-
ter.

For an unknown reason, how-
ever, USMACV has refused
to pay the secured rentals
including those for the ground
and first floors (Lease No.

“Such an attitude on the
part of USMACV amounts to
unlawful confiscation of prop-
erty from a Vietnamese citi-
zen, while the Americans and
other allied countries are
here to help the Vietnamese
people. If I might say so,
USMACV has been using
military force to deprive the
undersigned of the right to
use his property, namely the
Capitol Hotel.”

If USMACV cannot pay me
the rental why can it not re-
turn the building to me? I
am not interested in renting
my building any longer but

to rent it without any com.

Viet War Goals
Are Challenged

Dear Editor,

The U. S. military interven-
tion in Vietnam is wrong be-
cause:

—It violates the Golden
Rule. ‘Do unto others as you
would have them do unto
you.’ or are we forgetting
the Sermon on the Mount?

—It violates international
law. Vietnam, North and
South, is one sovereign na-
tion and we have no right to
interfere in its internal af-
fairs, or are we forgetting
our own Civil War?

—It violates the dictum of
Jesus: ‘Cast out the mote in
thine own eye, then thou
shalt see clearly how to help
thy neighbor.” We have plen-
ty to do at home. Are we
forgetting Jesus?

Think. Are we forgetting to
think for ourselves?

“I should be grateful, Mr.

the rights of a Vietnamese
citizen who is being unjustly
treated by Americans in uni-

ground floor on the promise

Rapid Consensus

and agreement are very rarely experienced
at pavidson in any areas of college life, whether it be
in student body or faculty-administration matters. And
at an intellectual institution too much consensus would
indeed be suspect and, in most cases, indicative of a
lack of desirable diversity among students and teachers.
Agreement within any group at Davidson is to say the

rey This is why the almost unanimous agreement

wn in almost all areas of the Blue Sky project is
doubly surprising. From the beginning of the study,
in recognizing the need for curriculum revision, to the
recent presentation of the Blue Sky Committee’s report
of objectives and outline, “the many months of discus-
sion and argument have ended in a remarkable degree
of agreement on both aims and means,” as the report
i S.
itselt Now the question is not as too whether or not
Davidson needs a curriculum revision or even, in
the main, how this revision is to be carried out. And
even on this a consensus seems to have been reached
—as fast as possible. ;

When the first budget including the adoption of
the program proposed by the ‘committee was present-
ed to the trustees, it was turned down on the grounds
that it was not economically feasible. Davidson, the
argument ran, simply does not have the money right
now to put a complete overhaul like this into effect—
like most small private colleges we are, if not in
trouble financially, not far from It.

This would have been a good enough exctise for
both faculty and administration and those students
interested in the program to accept an indefinite de-
lay in implementing the committee’s recommendations.

A new budget was prepered, after the first was
rejected, which, like the first, included the recom-
mendations of the Blue Sky Committee. The differ-
ence, however, was in that money was taken away
from various other items in the budget and channel-
ed toward the curriculum revision. It is hard to tell
exactly which sections of the old budget lost in allo-
cations, and whether the cuts were on present areas
of expenditure or proposed areas, but the point is
that a successful effort was made to see that the
money did come from somewhere. oo

Adoption of the report was clearly a priority item,
as was shown by the paring of other items on the bud-
get (such as proposed faculty raises) and most drama: -
tically by Dean Johnston in last Friday's open faculty
meeting when he stated that at the coming closed fac-
ulty meeting he would propose that the administration
and faculty “make a start (on the program) regardless
of the budget.” This is the sort of remark we are used
to hearing from the typical dissatisfied irresponsible
student, but not from the Dean of the Faculty. Clearly
the situation is regarded as exceptional even at the top.

The report of the Blue Sky Committee is one of
those things everybody talks about but almost no one,
at least among the students, reads. THE DAVIDSON-
IAN last week gave a summary of the main points of
the proposal, which is as far as most of us have gotten
with it. Now, after the report has been accepted in part
by the faculty, it still retains most of its original con-
tent, the phases being initiated next year being the
new calendar, a new set of requirements, and perhaps
at least a part of the new honors college program—in
other words, the major part of a whole new program
for Davidson. ;

There are, of course, a few areas of the report
with which not everyone agrees, whether it be be-
cause he believes it to be not ambitious enough in
scope or too ambitious. There are endless details to
work out before the program can be fully implement-
ed. There are financial and administrative questions
that will have to be answered eventually but which
now seem to be pretty much unanswerable.

All of these problems can and will be taken care
of, though. What is in order now is not anguish over
the unsolved details of the program but congratula-
tions to those who first conceived it and have carried
it through. It may be the last time any of us ever see
anything that close to unity at Davidson.

If Mr. Binh reads the re-

President Johnson and Secre-
tary of State Dean Rusk. he
should realize that Vietnam
is simply a battlefield for the
United States to contain the
Chinese, and that the U.S.
is not there in Saigon, Cholon
and all over his land. to help
the Vietnamese people.

Mr. Binh must remember
that in November 1966, the
mayor of Saigon, Colonel Van
Van Cua, was arrested and
handcuffed by the U.S. Mili-
tary Police in Saigon. Mr.
Binh’s insistence on the re-
turn of his property is tegiti-
mate but against the back-
ground of a situation In which
his own compatriots are de-
Stroyed dally both North and
South by the U.S. military
power, his demand seems to
me totally irretevant if not
comic.

I advise Mr. Binh to be-
friend a U.S. corporal to plea
for the restoration of his
hotel rather than to call on
General Thieu and General
Ky, the President and Vice
President elect of South
Vietnam.
