Dr. Johnston
Speaks On

Great Men

Professor Frontis W. Johnston, of

the History department, recently
conducted the first of a series of
Chapel talks on the lives of famous
United

States. This series will run for some

of the
months, with each talk being deliv-
ered insofar as possible, in connec-
tiom with the celebration of the
birthday of each of the men,

In his first talk, Professor John-
ston spoke on Woodrow Wilson-and
his contribution to the nation.

miliar to all Davidson men

is the

story of Wilson's attendance here for

a year, before he went to Princeton
to complete his degree. Wilson
later served as -president of Prince-
ton, then as- governor: of New Jer-
sey, and finally defeated President
Taft and Theodore Roosevelt in a
three-cornered race for the Presi-
dency of the United States in 1912,
Speaking of the contrast between
Roosevelt and Wilson, Dr. Johnston
said that the election was a contrast
“between the Old Testament and
the New, and the New, won.” Every-
one is familiar with Wilson’s. work
as Presfdent, and with his efforts
toward the establishment of a per-
manent peace after World War I.
Wilson's “idealism” was laughed at
in 1919, but the nation and the world
can now see the “ghost of Wilson
walking again.”

Professor Johnston is a graduate
of Davidson in the class of 1930, and
received his PhD. degree from Yale
in 1938. He has been a most popular
teacher at Davidson for some years,
The schedule for the remainder of
the Series of talks is as follows:

Jan. 17—Robert E. Lee.

Feb, 12—Abraham Lincoln,

Keb, 22—George Washington,
April 11- Thomas Jefferson,

Savannah, Ga. ; evening, Mr. Boggs;
January 28—morning, Dr. Cunning-
ham; evening, Mr, Boggs.
