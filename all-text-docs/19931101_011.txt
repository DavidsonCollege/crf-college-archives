THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1993 11

Enough is enough. .

With all due respect, enough
is enough.

When I first visited Davidson
College in the spring of 1991, the
campus had recovered ftom Hurri-
cane Hugo, the dogwood trees were
all in bloom, and there was a full
track around Richardson Field.
Really takes you back, eh? I fell in
love with the campus then.

When I arrived as a freshman
that fall, there was only one major
difference: no track. Well, there
was a track, but only the outer
three lanes were left after the wid-
ening of the soccer field. Never-

theless, I decided to continue run-

ning track—as any athlete will tell
you, a sport becomes part of your
life, and after four years of suc-
cessful competition it was difficult
to think about quitting. Besides, as
the Athletic Department promised,
a new facility (or maybe even a
renovation of the old one) was
coming soon.

Now, two full years later, the
track is down to one lane, unless
you want to dodge potholes on
your way through the first turn (not
easy to do at high speed, I might
add). i
As my third track season ap-
proaches there is still no site for a
new track, and no action is ex-
pected anytime soon. What hap-
pened to all the promises?

I doubt that my own situation
is really that much different from
anyone else’s, because disillusion-
ment seems to be the norm here.
Davidson is not the shining Mecca
that many of us thought it would
be, but then that’s likely to happen
many more times in our lives. It is
a person’s response to situations
like this, not the situations them-
selves, that will ultimately define
him or her. When your plans for

the future just flat don’t pan out,
will you sit back and hope for
change to come on its own, and
talk about the way things ought to
be?

That’s how most people
handle problems in their lives, just
like I have all too often. The alter-
native, of course, is to get off your
butt and do something about it.

For me, the whole track issue
is largely bitter, rhetorical, and
moot. Next year will find me pur-

suing my .engineering degree at
NC State, where the intramural
program runs on an 8-lane, high-
tech, pothole-free synthetic sur-

‘face. This means that I won’t be

here when the new track and field
facility is finally completed. There
is more to the issue than my own
involvement, though.

Somehow, despite the poor
quality of our track, despite the
relatively mediocre quality of our
team, coaches Beth Manson and
Gary Andrew have managed to
recruit a talented group of young
runners, including more than ten
freshmen and -womenonthecross
country team this fall.

These athletes represent the
future of Davidson track and field,
and they have the talent to take the
program toa level above any it has
ever achieved. These young ath-

same time I was not enjoying the
things that I usually loved, and my
concentration was shot. In short, I
‘became an expert at plaster-star-
ing. I woke up every morning
asking, “Why am I alive?” and
going to bed every night thinking,
“Why am I still alive?”

My point is that this is not the
state of mind to be in when trying
to problem-solve. To Stephen
Faller, I couldn’t have successful
therapy or figure things out for
myself because I was so depressed.
know this isn’t always an easy
concept to grasp, but consider what
it would be like to be a statue made
of cement, your mind only work-
ing at one-fourth speed and psy-
chologically unable to talk about
anything more personal than the
weather.

This story does have a good
ending. I had a friend who cared
enough and persevered enough to
make me talk. The hardest thing

help. He made me do it, and he
saved my life. Evenso, my parents

was clini-

seek medical advice. It was notan
easy-decision for me and my par-
ents, but I have been on Zoloft (a
drug very similar to Prozac) since
January. We know we made the
right choice. That’s not to say I
don’t have problems any more or
don’t get down once in a while.
The difference is that I can think
clearly and deal with my problems
like a normal human being. Ican-
not overemphasize the fact that I
would not have been able to do it
without Zoloft.

I’d like to leave you with one
more message. Depression can be
very hard to identify; it took me
years. Also, the more depressed a
person is, the less likely they are to
be able to help themselves. Please,
if you or someone you know is
depressed, do something. Asking
for help takes enormous amounts
of courage, but it has to be done.
There are people all around who
can help. For starters, try the Stu-
dent Counseling Center, or just
talk to someone you trust. I'd be
more than glad to talk to people
about my experiences or just offer
an open ear and a comfortable
shoulder, Just please taik to some-

Sincerely,

_letes deserve to train and compete

in an environment that will allow
them to realize their enormous po-
tential; the hard-working and dedi-
cated coaches deserve some re-
ward for the time and effort that
they have invested in the Davidson
Athletic Department. In short, the
track team deserves the same re-
spect that is given to all varsity
athletes here. They deserve ad-
equate training facilities. They
deserve a track.

Now, lobbying for a new track
won’t affect me directly, “cause

I’ll be outta here after this year.’

Butit will make a difference in the
lives of my teammates, both present
and future, and for that reason I
have decided to get off my butt and
do something, if only to raise a
good old-fashioned ruckus. I chal-
lenge everyone at Davidson to do
the same for something that they
care deeply about.

Maybe you can’t make things
better for you while you’re here—
at least you can make things better
for those who will come after you.
Whether it is something tangible,
like a new facility, or something
more ephemeral, like an improve-
ment inthe harmony and together-
ness of the Davidson community,
each and every person here has the
power to make a lasting contribu-
tion to this-college. If we don’t
charige things, who will? If we
don’t start now, when will we?

With the track, as with most of

‘ the problems that we face here as

students, words are no longer a
sufficient medium for improve-
ment—definitiye steps must be
taken to improve our situation. The
time for promises has passed; now
is the time for action.

I can't believe they saw two
Garth Brooks shows.

Ihave to admit that earlier this
week I was a little nervous that I
wouldn’t have anything to write
about this week. I mean, there
weren’t anymore awards shows,
and nobody slammed my column
last week, so I really was plumb
out ofideas as to what I might write
about. But then I saw it. Tucked
back into the Arts section was an
article about him. I knew I was
going to be sick.

Brooks.” Ouch. Folks, Garth
Brooks (dirty thief) didn’t write
“Shameless,” Billy Joel did. He
recorded it first. Is Billy Joel THE
man of country music? It’s his
song that has elevated Mr. Brooks
(sell-out) to the multi-media
megastar status he now enjoys.
Sorry, Garth (loser). I realize that
the world is becoming more liberal
and tolerant about a lot of things,
but Imyselfstill

The illustrious
weekly that I call
home had actually
published an ar-
ticle about that
man. That guitar-
smashing, song-

"That guitar-smash-
ing, song-stealing,
self-centered,
barbarian-disguised-
as-a-country-singer."

pletely accept

goes both ways

tered, barbarian-disguised-as-a-

complementing him! >

Now, I’m not trying to per-
petuate intra-newspaper warfare.
The fact is that I simply cannot
leave this subject untouched any
longer. This week I would like to
present to you the testimony of a
Garth Brooks-hater insa world
where half of all country music
listeners think he invented it. I am
not ashamed of my problem, but
the aversion I feel towards Garth
is, indeed, chemical. I shall not be
moved.

The most painful words I ever
hear are these: “No, I don’t listen
to country. But I like Garth

wenttoboth concerts? Iam shocked
and offended. I also resent your
insulting Stephanie Davis in such
a manner. She was on my fresh-
man hall last year and could school
Garth (off-key) any day. And he
was wearing “second-skin Wran-
glers”? Kids, Garth Brooks (over-
inflated walrus) is fat. I’d rather
not have such a superb view.

And they went to both con-
certs? I’m still not over it.

Once upon atime (cold day in
hell) I was a Garth Brooks (not
even) fan. Looking back, all I can
say is: blame it all on my roots, I
hate him.

I can’t believe you went to
both shows.

Don't make something out of nothing

college’s matriculants (yes, that’s
us), this time with happy faces,
flowers, or something like that.
Well, the covers are kind of stupid,
but can anyone remember when
the directories actually said some-
thing funny, or important on the
cover (those from the Union, Dean
of Students office, or wherever do
notneed to write back next week to
bitch about that— there’s no of-
fense meant.

They are dumb, Til give you
that. However, whoever does print
these thingsup surely didnot mean

. to offend.women for men, for that

matter) with “Sam, I can’t believe
it’s been twenty years!” Why, in
fact, is there a problem with the
infamous cover? Is it because the
woman does not look like the typi-
cal Davidson woman? (This is not
my opinion, by the way; many
Davidson women have actually
said this). So, ifa portly woman on
the cover were wearing a business
suit and glasses and she said, “You
bet it’s been twenty years, Sam,”
would that have made you a little
more comfortable?

I realiy do not have time to
write professors every week,
mostly because they keep me busy
with all of the homework they as-

sign. But this last letter needed to
be addressed. People are people,
white, black, red, green, orange,
yellow, who cares? Women and
minorities have gotten shafted
throughout history, but as the not-
so-great Rodney King once said,
“Can’t we all just get along?” Itis
time to start living as a species, not
as races and sexes. When people
complain about stuff like this, they
amplify my discontent with PC.
These are telephone books, for
Christ’s sake; stop making prob-
lems out of nothing, and stop do-
ing nothing about the problems.

Disappointed,
