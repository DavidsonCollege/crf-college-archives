Dr. Grubb of England
Delivers Vespers Talk

Life Story of C. T. Studd I
Basis of Talk

Dr. Norman P. Grubb, secretary
of the World Wide Evangelistic
Crusade, preached before a large
vesper audience Sunday night.

Dr. Grubb, who was himself a
missionary in the Belgian Congo
for six. years, cautioned that we
are forgetting the realities of the
3ible. He based his talk on the}
life of C. T. Studd, great Cambridge |
athlete, who later became one of |

the greatest Christian leaders of all
time. His book on the life of Mr.
Studd is very well known. He em-
phasized the fact that religion did
not greatly influence either his life

or C. T. Studd’s until after their
college days. Mr. Studd then de-
cided to devote his life and his
fortune to the Mission fields and
led a group of fellow graduates
known as. the “Cambridge Seven”

to Africa. He led this mission un-
til his death.
