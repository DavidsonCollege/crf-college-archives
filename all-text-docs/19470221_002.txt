‘Che Liquor Question . . .

Davidson College is in the awakening
process after the lean war years. Many
members of the student body as well as the
administration are sitting in the grand-
stand and wondering just which way she
will fall. One of the most pressing issues
before our student body today, which, by
the way, is being dodged by everyone, is
that of drinking, The time has come when
something should and must be said.

Tam not so foolish as to believe that my
few lines in this paper will reform anyone,
{ already know what the re-action of the
drinkers will be. They will undoubtedly
scoff and laugh and say that I'm a “mish.”
For them there is nothing that I can do.
To those members of our student body
who, like myself, do not use alcohol, I have
nothing to offer other than a word of com-
mendation. To those fellows, however, who
are at present in the middle of the road,
and who are not sure of which path to fol-
low, I address this article in the hope that
it will be of same help.

Relatively speaking, Davidson is. still
one of the last monuments to dances and
social functions where people have a bet-
ter time than at other schools and do so
without the aid of intoxicants. Anyone
who says it can't be done is wrong. Our
larger state institutions throughout the
country evidently think that such a thing
is impossible. Outside of the colleges the
whole-country is on the wettest spree in
her history. Where is it all leading? Well,
it cracked the mighty Roman Empire. and
it will just as certainly crack us if we as
individuals do not do something about it.

}

I will again accomplish nothing if I
merely turn this column into.a wrangle on
prohibition. There are many arguments
on both sides of the question. One thing
is certain, Prohibition will never stand so
long as a majority of the people are not
firmly behind it. Laws which do not arise
from the people but which are imposed
from above will never stand up. The an-
swer then is to gain that majority. Not by
over pious preaching, as some may think
that I am doing here, but by setting an
example for others. By showing the ‘‘mid-
dle of the road men” that normal, healthy,
average citizens and not merely a handful
of saints think that old John Barleycorn
should be banished from our country and
our world,

Swan Song...

With the publication of 5 more issues of
the Davidsonian, the Spring elections will
have provided the student body with a new
Ieditor-in-Chief and accordingly new men
of the rising Junior class will step into
the shoes of the managing editors now
serving with the staff. Ordinarily the old
editor hands over the reigng to the editor
elect at that time, but much to the sorrow of
yours truly, it has become necessary that
I sign my final thirty at this advanced
date. When a man resigns from any post,
he must have reasons for doing so, and
it is only proper that I give an adequate
explanation for this unusual action that
I am taking® :

First of all, the person who has the
honor of being elected to this position
must be an individual who is long on gray
matter who has discarded the
theory that sleep is essential if one is to

and one

live. Your editor was able to adjust to
sleeplessness, but on the first point he has
found himself taking the count and the
scholarship line has been difficult to hold.
Many past editors of the Dazidsonian
now hold positions of importance in the
field of journalism. Not a few are with
the large press associations, and in my
opinion a year with this publication offers
more of value than ten courses in journa-
lism. For me, however, the Davidsonian is
and has been nothing more than a hobby

issue is simple and clear cut... a college

With
Bob

BY BOB RIERSON

Picking up the loose ends... The
time seems now to be ripe for the
setting forth of results from the
recently conducted poll of students
opinion concerning the relative
merits of the semester and quarter
systems of college administration.

The ‘consensus of opinion seems
definitely to favor the latter which

has already been adopted in so many

of the nation’s educational institu-
tions. All the points formerly set
down in this corner seem to,add to
an overwhelming endorsement of
the quarter system, and in truth
there seems to be very little ob-
jection that might be raised. The
students who objected to this sys-
tem could raise no constructive
criticism of it and could not at any
rate show what advantage. if any,

the semester system has. It would
seem that actually the objectors
were opposing only the idea of

change which is in itself a trait in-
born into the nature of human be-
ings. I believe that a deliberative
persuing of the subject could not
help but show to anyone that the
quarter system is without doubt
the best. As much if not more can
be learned under it than under the
now outmoded semester plan.

It now appears unavoilable that
within five all progressive
institutions will have shifted over
to this new plan, and since this
definitely concerns. our own school,
we may ask along with the sign
hanging the entrance to a
noted undertaking establishment in
Charlotte, “Eventually, why not
NOW,

By this time all interested (and
who isn't?) Wildcats must be aware
of the conspicuous absence of a not-
ed (or notorious) publication of the
student body that this paper had re-
ported to be coming out on Friday
last. This is an excusable error,

years

over

however, since the __Davidsonian
must be prepared five days ahead
of time. But since a goodly number
(upwards of 97.82%) of the students
have wondered as to the reason for
its non-appearance, I shall now
undertake to inform them of the
true facts of the case, as received
from a very reliable source which
is entirely neutral on the matter,
knowing absolutely nothing about
it. It seems that the contents of
said magazine were, to a great de-
gree, deemed unadvisedly mature
for the average Davidson brain
which is still in its formative period.

Accordingly the Lily White
League of Cornelius and Davidson,
not to mention outlying extremities
such as Beatty’s Ford and Mount
Mourne, appointed a delegation to
meet the train when it arrived with
the contraband bundles of the maga-
zine. These bundles were spirited
away by the worthy delegation,
composed entirely of elderly ladies,
and have not been seen since, al-
though this is not to say that they
have not been sought. On the con-
trary, every Wildcat is now obsess-
ed with the desire to get a copy by
fair means or foul (the latter seem-
ing to have more advocates) and
greedily to consume its contents to
the utmost satisfaction.

Prices are being quoted in the
local market as far exceeding all
expectations. For some unknown
reason the demand for the magazine
has risen directly with its non-
availability. This all goes to prove
the old theory concerning the ban-
ning of books, etc., and the conse-
quent effects on human nature. But
just in case someone wants to see
it bad enough, contact Joe in the
basement of Georgia and bring your
bankroll with you. This Joe claims
to have gotten to the train before
the delegation did!

Seen at the Queens College
“Sweetheart Ball’ over the week-
end were Brothers McLean, Newell,
Johnson, Miller, Robertson, Sutton,
Long, and Turnipseed. All report
extensive deals at the various sor-

ority breakfasts following the
brawl. Brother Tate was off to
Morganton to listen to wedding

bells and returned to D. C. Sunday

. one of the belles found its way
into the big blue and made the re-
turn jaunt with the dashing young
gentleman. Brother Starnes toured
to the old homestead in the land
of the sky while Brothers Oglesby,
Foote and Montgomery were off to
Charlotte and _ vicinity. Brother
Cameron was off to Greensboro as
usual with Brother Colson on an-
other gigantic operation to Jack-
sonville. The chapter enjoyed a
feed at the house following vespers
on Sunday night. Brother Starnes
entertained the chapter with his
vocalizing and inimitable piano
stylings.

The ranks of Sigma chapter were
strengthened this past week by the
initiation of 25 pledges. Ten men

Six new pledges have been warm-
ly welcomed into the chapter. They
are Houston Matthews, Harvey Mc-
Connell, George Howard, Randy
Kabrick, Morris Hardy, and Bill
Bason. Several of the. brothers
trotted out to Queens for their
“Sweethearts Ball”. One prominent
patron of said school has been
dubbed “Heartaches.” At least he
has one friend Kurt Webster.

Wooglin’s sons were scattered far
and wide this weekend. Colleges
visited include Queens, Salem, Duke,
Randolph-Macon, ete. Brothers
Lemmon and Vinson made their
way up to Duke to see Lemmon’s
“sister” and friend. McGehee made
his usual visit to see Dot. Brother
Yokum went all the way to Ran-
dolph-Macon just to see an “old
family friend.” Hope it was a pleas-
ant reunion. Brothers McConnell,
Jim Gunn, Scarborough and many
othes went to Salem, and from all
reports they had the situation well
in hand. Dave .comments that
“Davey Jones Locker” is most ex-
cellent when the lights are out.
Scarborough was reluctant to go
up there, but he evidently made-up
with Fisher again as he had to be
dragged back to the “schoolastic”
campus. Brother Schmidt, carry-
ing on in ex-pledge brother Morton’s
absence, squired “Inkie’. to the
Queen’s dance, later ‘took her home
the long way to Mooresville.

Amorous Amos Ragan ambled

I recall, it hurt my ears.”

Cinema Comments

By Doug Swink

Last week I signed my “30,” but
since writing that, incidents have
avisen which have proved to me
conclusively that it is best for a
writer to have more outlets than
one for his writings. So, twisting
both editor’s arms (the Davidson-
ian’s office is getting as crowded
as the capitol building in Atlanta)
I once more take up my pen and
scribble.

MONDAY AND TUESDAY
FEBRUARY 24-25
“THE KILLERS”

Adapted from Ernest Heming-
way’s thriller of the same name,
this movie has the background to
become a top-notch picture. In
the beginning the director has kept
the terror-by-suggestion dialogue
and scene where two assassins talk
tough to some people in a lunch
room. They are planning on kill-
ing big. Swede (Burt Lancaster)
whose-life ‘does not seem worth-
while preserving after two misbe-
haviorists, Albert Dekker and Ana
Gardner get through with him: The
story is unwound by an insurance
investigator (Edmond O’Brien)
whose job it is to investigate the
Swede’s beneficiary, an Atlantic
City chambermaid.

WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY
FEBRUARY 26-27
“THE SECRET HEART”

A stepdaughter (June Allyson)
is a character who has just stepped
out of Frend and who continually
sits at a piano playing Debussy and
pensing on her father’s memory.
Her mother (Claudette Colbert)
works her fingers to the bone over
big real estate deals trying to keep
the family with an income. The
mother’s second love-life (Walter
Pidgeon) is somewhat thwarted
by her daughter’s “unopportune
speeches and attempts at suicide.
However June falls in love and is
thus put out of the way.

FRIDAY AND SATURDAY
FEBRUARY 28-29

“UNDERCURRENT”

A gripping movie starring such
performers as Katherine Hepburn,
Robert Taylor, and Robert Mitchum.
The plot concerns a daughter of a
scientist who, haying been‘ swept
off her feet by’ a rich ariplane
tycoon, marries him. Her. newly ac-
quired brother-in-law begins to in-
terest her as everyone knows him
except her, and she cannot find
him anywhere. Taylor goes into
hysterical fits whenever his name
is mentioned, and before Katy
knows it she is involved in a psy-
chological mystery. Heartily recom-
mended. for good entertainment.
