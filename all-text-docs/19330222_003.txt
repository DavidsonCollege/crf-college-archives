“How many people have you talked to in

and followed it up with a story of a boy

his brother. His father heard of his plight
and came to the speaker for assistance. In
his letter to his brother, the boy had spoken
ungratefully of his old father and had cursed
him, but nevertheless the father still loved
and cared for his son, and told the lawyer
to get his son out of prison at any cost; that
he would give every cent he had. Mr. Har-
graves said he went to California to see the
boy and there after a long talk with the boy
made him repent toward his earthly father
and then asked him of-his Heavenly Father.
The boy repented filly and after about a
year in prison came home to his heart-sick
father and from then on he also loved his
Heavenly Father. This freedom the speaker
accredited to the prayer group that prayed
for him every day back at home and to the
prayers the boy offered in prison.

The speaker then pointed out that we
don't agonize enough in our, prayers. That
sometimes when we are praying that if the
Lord would come and ask us just what we
wanted we couldn't tell Him.

In closing, Mr. Hargraves stated that our

lives should be like a_ street-lighter—that
every life we touch should light up for
Christ, and long after we cannot be seen

a

any more, our influence should continue. He
closed his talk with a prayer in Which he
asked Our Heavenly Father not to let us
bother about every-day affairs or life, but
give us trust in Him, which was our only
source of strength.

After another song the service was dis-
missed in prayer by Dr. Walter L. Lingle,
president of the college.

Mr. Hargraves came to Davidson from
Charlotte, where on Sunday afternoon he
spoke at one of the seven mass meetings
held at the Carolina Theatre, and sponsored
by the Y..M. C. A. of that city.

something that made me think about it.
Just think of this, some of the tobacco in Chest-
erfield—the Turkish—comes from 4000 miles away!
And before it is shipped every single leaf is packed
by hand. All because Turkish tobacco is so small
and delicate.
Of course I don’t know much about making
cigarettes, but I do know this—that Chesterfields are
milder and have a very pleasjng aroma and taste.
They satisfy—and that’s what counts with me!

Spicy leaves of
TURKISH tobacco
