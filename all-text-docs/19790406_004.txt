entertaining. After all, film
historians ‘said for years, the
American studio system used to
push movies through assembly
lines the way Detroit cranks out
cars, with no innovation, no
room for individual creative
input.

But the historians have
changed their views (with: the
rise of television, even eae
- wood didn’t look so bad), and
the Visualite theatre in Char-

lotte is right with them, offering -

a major retrospective of Ameri-
cah films from the 30s to the
50's.

True, these films were mass-
produced, but that never
stopped directors like Hitch-
cock, Wilder or Capra from
adding some new twists. Just
pick up ‘The Charlotte Obser-
ver’s movie section and try to
find a new movie with the
rapid-fire wit of The Big Sheep
with Humphrey Bogart and
Lauren Bacall, or the fiery
rebelliousness of James Dean in
Rebel Without a Cause.

The Hooray for Hollywood
series runs at the Visualite
through the end of April. Virtu-
ally every film is a must; but,
knowing the Davidson stu-
dent’s busy schedule, most of
-us will only be able to make one
or two. Here are some hints:

North by Northwest and
Notorious on March 29-31, are
two of Hitchcock’s best, full of
spies, Nazis, intrigue and, inci-
dentally, Cary Grant, Ingrid
Bergman and James Mason.
Hitchcock's films are a marvel
of precision, withought a was-
ted minute in the bunch.

James Cagney stars in Public
Enemy (April 1-4) as a two-bit
gangster fighting his way to the
top. Anyone who thinks John
Travolta has class never saw

Cagney smash that grapefruit

into Mae Clark’s face.

Frankenstein and Dracula,
both made in 1931, are on April
5-7. Boris Karloff and Bela
Lugosi brought a touch of depth
to horror movies that dis-
appeared years ago in. favor of
shock and gore. The creativity
and atmosphere of these films
has stood up for almost fifty
years without adent. —

Doesn’t anyone ever, won
what happened to the era of the
crazy college kid?

In late November 1972, Dav-
idson freshman‘Gerald Plotz ate
51 hard-boiled eggs in two
hours to crack Paul Newman’s
film record of 50 eggs in Cool:
Hand Luke.

“A group of us were sitting
around the room one night
talking about the movie,” said
Plotz. ‘‘Being a fool. by occupa-
tion, I said that it wouldn’t be
too hard to beat that. A football
player challenged me.”’

‘*‘Once I was challenged, I
had to go through with it,”’
continued Plotz. ‘‘I don't usual-
ly do that sort of thing.”

Yetsbefore his egg-eating
feat, Plotz consumed 50 meat-
balls at one sitting when Rusk
House had an_ all-you-can-eat
plan as part of the College
dining service. ‘‘I had some
wonderful times there,’’ said
Plotz.

Cause is the famous monument

to the struggle of the adolescert~

in an increasingly ambiguous
role, and East of Eden was
based on the Steinbeck novel
about romance and jealousy in a
small town.

Acting just wasn’t the same
after Dean and Brando.

Before a large audience in the
College Union, Plotz downed 15
eggs in 11 minutes taking time
to salt and pepper each one.
After then, he began to slow
down to a more ‘‘normal”’ pace.
“Things got rough when I hit
30,"" said Plotz.

With time running out, Plotz
“crammed in two eggs whole.”

Though he received credit for

eating them, Plotz described
them as having ‘‘shot back up
like cannonballs.’’ Afterwards
he played a little soccer and
polished off a pint of chocolate
ice cream before bed. ‘‘The
yolks coat your esophagus so
you have to eat something else
afterwards to take the uncom-
fortable feeling away,’’ he ex-
plained.

Plotz didn’t stay around
Davidson long after his exhibi-
tion of gastronomic fortitude.
He transferred to the Univer-
sity of Honolulu. He now
teaches 7th and 8th grade
Language Arts and Speech.

“I'm still a great fancier of
buffets,’’ confessed Plotz. ‘I do
my best to drive up the food
cost. There you can get all you
want for six to seven dollars.”’
