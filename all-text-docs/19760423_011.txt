By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor

Davidson’s tennis team
smashed and volleyed their
way to the Southern Confe-

rence regular season title with.

convincing victories over East
Carolina and Richmond.

Davidson went into the
matches with a 5-0 conference
slate and needed a pair of
victories to win the title out
right. The Wildcats left little
to chance as they destroyed
the hapless Pirates 9-0 and
then crushed a potentially
powerful Richthond squad 6-3.

Entering the East Carolina
match with nine straight deci-
sions, the Wildcats took little

rates.

Chip Bondurant defeated
Tom Durfee 6-1, 6-0 in the
number one singles match and
Steve Holman shut out Bob
Neff 6-0, 6-0 in the fourth
singles.

Bondurant and Stewart
Boswell lost the only set of the
day for Davidson but rallied to
win the number one doubles
match 6-4, 5-7, 6-1.

In the rest of the singles
competition, Mike Barnhill
and John Mitchell both routed
their opponents 6-3, 6-1 while
Brian Cooper and John Trout
took the numbers five and six

Head coach Jeff Frank was
pleased that his squad avoided
a let down after edging power-
ful Appalachian State 5-4 on
Wednesday.

“The Furman Coach had
warned me that they were
unorthodox but that they
could be tough so we took
extra precautions against re-
garding them lightly,’’ Frank
explained.

“Our kids all got ahead of
them quickly and just never
let their opponents get
started.”’

Davidson’s decisive victory
over East Carolina set the
stage for Saturday’s climactic
match with Richmond.

After losing the first and
second singles competition,
the Wildcats showed good
depth by sweeping the third
through sixth matches. Mit-
chell’s pivotal 7-5, 7-5 victory
over Gary Stern provided
Davidson with a:4-2 advan-
tage going into the doubles
instead of a 3-3 deadlock.

Andy White and Barnhill
clinched the Wildcats first
tennis title since 1973 with a
victory in the second doubles
match. Holman and Steve
Johnson wrapped up the
scoring with a win in the
number three doubles to re-
main undefeated in conference

play.

““We expected extremely
tough matches in the first two
singles and first doubles and
that’s exactly what happened.
It’s almost as if they had three
points before the match
started,’ noted Frank.

Davidson’s eleven match
winning streak came to an
abrupt halt on Monday when
they dropped a 9-0 decision to
South Carolina. The match
was closer than the score
