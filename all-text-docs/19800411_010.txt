Sports Scripts
Individual sailors excel

Davidson's intercollegiate sailing team finished third in the Duke
Points Regatta held at Kerr Lake this past Saturday. On Sunday
another Cat sailing contingent could do no better than sixth in an
invitational hosted by Clemson University.

' In the Kerr Lake competition, Kirk Williams and Don Rose
skippered their A and B division vessels to identical third place
finishes which understandably left Davidson in third place overall.
David Lyons and Bill Bankhead served as crew members for the
Cat skippers. Ned Grier and Stuart Baskin guided their crafts to
respective sixth and fourth place finishes in the Clemson
Invitational. Some sailing score manipulation left Davidson in
sixth place overall‘however. Crew members for Grier and Baskin
included Jeff Harris and Donya Boylston.

Next weekend finds the sailors on Lake Norman for an

Invitational; Davidson will serve as the host-team.

Soccer overpowered

The Davidson Women’s Soccer “‘A’’ Team journeyed to Duke
last week to challenge a strong club team but lost: 2-0.

Both teams played hard and well, but Davidson was out-
numbered on the bench with only one substitute compared to 7 for
Duke. A goal early in the game put Davidson behind 1-0, and
‘though the Cat defense was tight, Duke scored again in the final
minutes to wrap the game up 2-0. Davidson put up a good fight,
with outstanding performances by striker Joanna Fleming and
back Kirsten McDonald. The next two sets of games will be played
this weekend at home. —PAM HAWKINS

Netters coast to tourney

The men’s tennis ‘team shellacked the 49ers of UNCC 6-0 last
Thursday to run its record to 7-5 on the year. The impressive win
should provide needed momentum for the Cats as they head into
important Southern Conferences matches this weekend.

A quadrangular match hosted by Furman is scheduled for this
weekend. On Friday the Cats take on Furman, the Conference's
leading squad. Saturday morning has the Cats challenging
University of Tennessee at Chatanooga, currently in third place;
and Saturday afternoon Marshall provides the opposition.

Coach Jeff Frank is receiving strong play from Jeff Lyle and Jim
Haynes who seem to be getting their respective acts together. Also
the doubles combination of Aller Lazenby and Rick Johnston are
coordinating their games better and should pick up some key wins
as the season wears on. —JOE FORD
