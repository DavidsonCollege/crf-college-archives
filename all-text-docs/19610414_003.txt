Sideline

By STEVE CLARK

DOLE EYES BIG YEAR

Coach Bill Dole has put his hopeful footballers
through the mill this spring, and he likes what he has
seen. He's liked it so much in fact, that he was prompted
to say, “It’s been the best spring practice ever at David-
son.”

Tomorrow afternoon, Dole gets a chance to see what
the fellows have learned, when he and his aides wil! con-
duct the Red-Black game, a Beaver Club project. Except
for kickoffs, the game will be played under regular game
conditions.

Actually, the Black team will be called the Whites,
since Doc, the veteran equipment man, just can’t seem to
dig up any black uniforms. And to be even more precise,
our school colors are scarlet and black. But who is going
to press that point?

Regardless of what you call the game, and despite what
colored uniforms will be worn, the intra-squad fray is
shaping up to be a real thriller.

Players on both sides are claiming that their team is
the best, and one can be assured that. when action gets un-
derway at 2 p. m., things will be a little more rigorous
than a pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey party.

Participating in tomorrow’s contest will be 21 letter-
men from this past fall’s team that compiled a 3-5 rec-
ord, including wins over Catawba, VPI, and Lehigh. In ad-
dition, 22 sophomore aspirants will be knocking heads in
an effort to crack into the lineup somewhere.

Only letter winners not participating for various rea-
sons are end Jennings Snider, tackle Sonny Fraley, and
guard Cecil Holcomb. In addition, it is doubtful if quar-
terback Kent Tucker will be able to go due to an injury
sustained in last Saturday’s practice.

Tomorrow is just the beginning of what we think will
be a good football season here at Davidson next fall. Dole
has more and better materia! to work with than ever be-
fore, and if a few sophomores pan out, the Wildcats could
be a real threat to the larger schools’ domination of con-
ference laurels. :

Defense will be the key word again next fall as Dole
will probably have one of the hardest hitting units in the
conference. Main offensive problem should be quarter-
back, but this stigma could easily be eliminated if sopho-
mores Ear! Cole and Benny Coxton come through.

Glancing quickly at the two rosters for tomorrow’s
clash, we would like to stick our necks out and predict:
Botn lines are about equal in experience, size, and speed;
however, the Reds’ faster backfield gives them the nod —
say, Reds 19, Whites 14.

SOCCER SCHEDULE ANNOUNCED

Dr. Paul A. Marrotte, who has guided the soccer team
through two highly successful seasons, and who decided
to retire at the end of this past season in order to spend
more time on his tasks as a history professor, announced
the 1961 soccer schedule earlier this week.

The schedule consists of 11 games, six at home and
five away, and includes newcomers South Carolina and
Appalachian. To make room for these new opponents,
Pfeiffer will be played only once instead of the usual two

games with the Falcons.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Comments Experienced Paladins

Host Double-Header

Reports on Furman indicate
that the Paladins are an ex-
perienced ball club with several
good hitters and a train load of
hard-throwing hurlers.

The Wildcats had a streak
of tough luck during the

spring holidays on their tour
through Georgia as they won
only one of four games.

Jerry Jacques, 5 senior who
has not pitched before this
year, was the winning pitcher
in the ’Cats only victory at. Mer-
cer, 6-5, on the last day of the
tour.

Jacques’ win was in danger in
the ninth inning when there
were two Mercer men on base

with only one out, and a David-
‘son lead of only one run. But
Jerry Shelton made a running
catch, fell to the ground, and
rolled over and up in time to
throw to second base for the
double play.

By JERRY TRAMMELL
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The Davidson baseball team travels to Furman today
in hopes of improving its 3-7 (1 tie) overall record, and
its conference standing of 1-

2.

In the other three games
Davidson lost two games to
Georgia Southern by scores of
124 and 11-6. They also drep-
ped one to Kentucky, 18-6.

Last Monday the ‘Cats were
host to William & Mary for a
double-header, which the two
teams split. Behind winning
pitcher Tommy Hamilton, David-
son took the first game, 9-3. but
was defeated in the second
game, 19-7. The locals led in the
fifth frame of the second game
by 5-1, but blew up in the last
minutes of the game as the
Indians scored 13 runs in the
humiliating top of the sixth.

In commenting on the games
played thus far; Stevens stated,
“The hitting and team defense
have been. adequate, but the
pitching has been weak. I feel
that the pitching will definitely
improve as the pitchers gain
confidence in themselves.”

Stevens tabbed Harry Smith
and Tom Tuttle as the best
double-play combination he
has seen at Davidson. He
praised the hitting of Cecil

Hoicomb, who hit two home
runs against Kentucky; sopho-
more Carl Rust, whose knee

injury is sidelining him for
awhile; end Captain Russ
Cotton.

Jerry Cole, who has not play-
ed since the first game due to
an injured ankle, was expected
to return to the lineup this
week. Stevens said that Cole's
strong arm has been missed in

Gridders End Drills
In Tomorrow’s Clash

Coach Bill Dole gets a final look until fall at his 1961
edition of the Davidson football team tomorrow afternoon
at 2 p. m. in Richardson Stadium, where a hotly contested

intra-squad game is in sight.

The game, which is being tab-
bed the Red-Black spring foot-
ball game, will be between two
teams that Dole has divided as
evenly as possible from his re-
action to the players’ perform-
ances during spring drills.

Actually, the teams are di-
vided into Red and White units
since home uniforms are white
rather than black.

The game is being sponsored
by the Beaver Club, and admis-
sion will be 50 cents for students
and faculty, and $1.00 for “out-
siders.”

NO KICKOFFS

The contest will be conducted
under regular game conditions,
except there will be no kick-
offs, Dole and his assistants will
place the ball down at the thir-
ty-yard stripe to begin play.

Tomorrow's activity will bring
to a close what Dole ‘describes
as “the best spring practice
we've ever had.” All indications
point to a successful season on
the gridiron next fall, and to-
morrow will give fans a first
look at things to come.

Dole has divided his squad of
46 men as follows:

yy Sheffield*, Fred McGuirt,

Richard Booth, and Ed Rude.

FRANK McPHILLIPS displays his driving form that has meade

him ea top golfer this spring. Monday, the sophomore fied a 74 to

McPhillips Fires 74,

Barely Misses Ace

With only Verner Stanley back from last year’s con-
ference champion golf team, people didn’t figure that
Coach Tom Scott’s team-would be too good this year.

Inexperienced upperclassmen
and untried sophomores just
couldn't get the job done many
claimed, and so, aside from
Stanley, it was to be a lean year
on the links.

However, the newcomers have
come through in fine style, and
once again Davidson has a chal-
lenging golf squad. One of the
main reasons is sophomore
Frank McPhillips, our “Wildcat
‘of the Week.”

Going’ into yesterday's match
with Carolina, McPhillips was
undefeated in match play. He,
like everyone else, had a rough
time at Greenbrier (where meda-
list play was in effect), but ad-
mits that the bad weather af-
fected his play.

This past Monday, McPhillips
fired a 74 (ow for the day) a-
gainst Oak Ridge in Mooresville
and defeated his man 3-0. This

year, but he contends, “If I had
been putting half decent, I
could have shot 68 or 69."

The statement is easily prov-
ed by the fact that the Mobile,
Ala., native “hit” sixteen greens
— golf lingo meaning that he
was putting for birdies (one un-
der par) on sixteen of the eigh-
teen holes.

Teammate John Crute com-
mented “Frank was really hit-
ting the ball good today. He al-
most had a hole-in-one on num-
ber five.”

Crute was referring to the par
three, 120qyard, number five
hole at Mooresville, when Mc-
Phillip’s drive hit past the pin,
bounced back toward the hole,
rimmed the cup, and stopped
two inches from the cup.

Had the sophomore's ball
dropped in, he would have been
the first Davidsonian ever to

(Note: * indicates lettermen)|is his best score thus far this have had an ace in a match.

Next Monday and Tuesday Da-
vidson entertains Georgia
Southern. Stevens urges those
who appreciate good baseball to
see these games. He considers
Southern the best team that his
team will meet this season, and
that includes powerhouses Cita-
del, Richmond, and Wake. For-
est. Next Thursday VPI plays a
double-header here.

Golfers At State;

By GEORGE PEPPER
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Following yesterday’s match at Chapel Hill, the golf
team journeyed over to Raleigh fot a match with N. C.
State this afternoon. Coach Tom Scott was optimistic a-
bout today’s match since last year’s squad posted two
wins over the Wolfpack.

off against Carolina in the after-
noon. Those making the trip for
the crucial two-day tour were

During the spring break ‘the
linksters took part in the Green-

quarters for the famous Sammy
Snead. The tournament featured
18 colleges and universities from
the north and south.

However, the toughest op

turned out to be the snow and
freezing temperatures on the
first day, and the driving rain on
the second.

These conditions proved to
be advantageous to the north-
ern schools, as Ohio Univer-
sity finished first, followed
by Virginia, and West Vir-

The. ‘Cats finished seventh in
what was described by one cad-

tournament play I've seen in
fifty years.”

This past Monday, the golfers

John Maddox stood out head

This feat was good for twenty
points in the losing cause
