Bleacher Seat-———

By MIKE ADAMS

Watching a Davidson football game
certainly can be a frustrating experience.
1 have scen ten Wildcat games in the last
two years and I have yet to see a victory.
(The Cats did beat Wofford last year, but
that game was played in Spastanburg.)
Most of the games have not even been
close; many in the 50-10 range.

I'm a die-hard fan, though. I go to the
games every week expecting to see the
Wildcats win — or at least expecting
them to make a close game out of it. And.
they never do. °

There are several reasons for the lack
of success Davidson has experienced on
the gridiron. There have been injuries to
valuable players. The loss of senior Doug
Neil in 2 beleagured defensive backfield
leaps to mind. There are too many
freshman starting; the exchange between
freshman center Chip Cole and freshman
quarterback Peter Hughes led to three

‘fumbles against Lafayette. The bottom

Wildcats play has many players who are
bigger, stronger and faster than almost
anyone Davidson has to offer.

Davidson just does not have a good
football team, as is reflected in the won-
loss record and the scores of Wildcat
games. But the lack of a good football

team does not mean that the Cats do act.

play good football occasionally. They
do. And when they do, it.is worth watch
ing.

In just the last two games, the 33-7

loss to Bucknell and the 51-14 loss to-
Lafayette, there were several moments.

when the Cats looked like a good football
tcam. ,
In the Bucknell game, sophomore
running back Bryan Overcash tumed in a
69-yard punt retum — started by a great
bieck by junior running back Aaron Ea-
wards — to sct up the Cats only
touchdown. That touchdown came when
freshman receiver Shan Teel took away a

of the end zone. The defender got to the
ball first, but Ter] was more determined
to end up with it.

The St-14 score of the Lafayette
game may not look pretty on paper. but
— believe it or not — there were some
moments when the Cats looked good on
the field.

Junior linebacker Howard Hum-
phries prevented a sure touchdown in the
first. quarter when he ran down a
Lafayette running back to make a diving
tackle at the I t-yard line. This may be the
only time a Davidson player has caught
an opponent from behind all year.
Freshman end Cole Thomason had an all-
around good day, registering two quar-
terback sacks and batting down a pass.

Juttior Charlie Winbome had a poor
day punting on the whole. but he did get
off a beauty in the first quarter. With the
Wildcats trapped at their own five-yard
line, Winborne was forced to punt from
the back of the end zone. All he could

manage was a 46-yard punt under pres-
sure. Winborne's best moment came as
an end/quarterback. After taking a pitch
from Hughes, Winbome lofted a 25-yard
touchdown pass to Teel late in the third
quarter. ;

Senior Gary Stewart was the Cats
leading rusher on the day after he. ram-
bled 18 yards on a fake punt to get a first
down. Stewart, « defensive back, has
carmied the ball several time on fakes this
year and they have all been successful.

Hughes demonstrated the kind of pas-
sing that the Wildcat coaches hope to see
a lot of over the next three years when he
orchestrated a 99-yard touchdown drive
which he capped with a perfectly thrown,
38-yard scoring pass.

The Cats have made plays like these
in every game this year. Unfortunately,
they have not made nearly enough of
them and their opponents have made too
many. But they don't lay down and die

because they are not as good as the other

teams. And they are fun to watch,

line, however, is that every team the

pass from a Bucknell defender in the back

Referee troubles mar IMAC games

BY RICK CASE
For the third week in a row
there have been problems with the
teferees not showing up for
games. This not only inconveni-
ences the teams who you are sup-
posed to ref for, but it also erases

your. teams’ eligibility for post
season play. [MAC bas been very
forgiving of those who have neg-
lected to show up for games, but
this policy has officially ended, If
you blow off one game your team
is automatically out of any post

season tournament. If you blow
off two games your team gets
canned and no one will like you,
so please honor your resbon-
sibjlities to referee games,

This goes double for teams
such as Drop and Give, Bang
Gang, Derbydar, Booze Brothers,
and Damned Commanches who
care afl still eligible for end of the.
season tournaments due to the di-
vine grace of the IMAC.

Soccer destroys Marshall; falls

By PERRY MATHEWES

The Davidson soccer team
was on both ends of shutouts this
week as they defeated Marshall 6-
0 Saturday and fost to South
Carolina 5-0 Wednesday. The
Wam’s record sow stands at 4-1 i-
1,

Davidson dominated the Mar-
shall team throughout the game,
oulshooting the Herd 20 5. Good
ball control and passing kept the
action mostly in the Marshall half
of the field,

“We played the best first half
we've had all year,'' coach Charlie
Slagle said.

Davidson opened the scoring
ia the. 17th minute of the first half.
Sophomore forward Tracy Han-
Xing headed the ball across te
sophomore forward Mike Fried-
lander who sen the bal) home for
the First gost.

The second goal cume jueut

three minutes later when the
Davidson offense led by Hankins
pressured a Marshall fullback into
chipping the ball over the goal-
keeper for an own goal.

Ta the 39th minute, Friedlan-
der pushed the bal] pase the diving
goalkeeper to junior midfielder
Chip Wittmann who backheeled
the ball in the net for the third
goal,

Witmann added to the tally at
the start of the second half when
Foedlander took the ball dawn ta
the endline then crossed back to
Wittmann who drilled the ball into
the open goal,

With five minutes left in the-
game. junior Craig Mattison
headed in anather goal to increase
the lead to 5-0. Senior fullback
Chris Jones had the agsist.

. Two minutes later freshman
Rob Vest fod Friedlander the ball

who easily beat the goalkeeper for
his sesond goal of the game.

Junior goalkecper Josh Budde
got his fest shutout of the season.

The South Carolina game did
nat go nearly as well for David-
son, USC scored twice in the First.
half and three times in the second
half.

Davidson played (fairly well
apainst USC, the eighth ranked
team in the nation. but mistakes
hust them. South Carolina’s many
comer kicks and Davidson's
tiissed marking assignments al-
lowed USC to find the weaknesses
in the Wildcat defense.

“We had a lot of chances,”
Slagle said, “but you can't make
Mental mistakes against 4 team
that goad.”

of 532-27, Anthony McCarron and
John Davis led a potent offensive

attack which drove the ball consis-
tently on the Gold's defense. Tail-
pack Michael Holt had a great

game but wished that defensive
stopper Sherb Sentelle would
overcome his “equipment” prob-
lems,

In this weeks highlights,
Wemer Hall went down hard to
the Crabs by the score of 20-0, as
Wendy Warner had two
touchdowns on intercepted pas-
ses. In other games this week,
