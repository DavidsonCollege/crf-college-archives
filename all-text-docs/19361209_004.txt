FOOTBALL STARS PICKED
ON MYTHICAL ELEVENS

SPORTS AFIELD

BASKETBALL, WRESTLING TEAMS
READY TO START SEASONS

“The greatest football team in the
South was not at L. S. U., not at
Alabama, not at Tennessee, but at
a small Presbyterian college clois-
tered (you may say) among the
oaks up in North Carolina—Dav-

idson College.”

The above are the words or the
gist of the piece written by Edv
(Ole Timer) Camp i \lanta

the mythical all-star team we join
glad
you are getting those rewards so

our applause and say we're
justly yours.

This should be one of the banner
years in the athletic history of
Davidson. We've already had a
great football team, and now the
prospect is that we will have one
of the best basketball teams in the
recent history of the college. Cap-
tain Bill Quick and his- mates are
now engaged in a mad scramble for
places. Seldom has material been
so plentiful or the places so hard
fought for. From last year, Quick,
Maurice Peabody, Bill Hancock,
Wade Barrow, Ken Knorr, John
Armstrong, Bill Kiesewetter, Dick
Cathey, Lawrence Reid, and Her-
man Yearwood have come back.
Up from last year’s sterling frosh
quint come Grant Johnston, Bill
Boyd, Ned Iverson, John Tice and
others. With the early practice go-
ing at top speed, this is our year
for a great record.

Lo those always inquisitive over
eager to clamor for improvement
here is a note of cheer. One of the
executives in charge of athletics
stated that next year one of. the

modern electric clock-scoreboards
would be erected on Richardson
Field. Said he: “Whether the

scoreboard is presented to us by
some generous friend of the college
or whether we are forced to erect
one ourselves, there will be one of
the electric boards on Richardson
Field next year.”

Which will be the bigger game
this year, the Rose Bowl or the
Sugar Bowl? It looks from here,
the best teams will play in New
Orleans, but I don’t think the color
of the. Rose Bowl can be matched.
The best suggestion to me seems to
be the one that calls for the sup-
port of the Sugar Bowl by the
Southeastern Conference. The
champion of this group would in-
vite an opponent. The distance
wouldn't be so great, but, after all,
don't these Eastern teams really
treasure that trip to California —
and the Rose Bowl?
