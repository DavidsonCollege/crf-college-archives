body will be entitled to a certain number of
these invitations. The chief marshal, H. L.
Shaw, Jr., will have charge of distributing
the same and will give to each man only his
allotted quota unless he has a written state-
ment from some other student assighing his
invitations to the applicant.

The stone benches, the gift of the class of
'26 to the college, have already arrived and
will be put upon the campus within the next
two weeks. They will add much to the
beauty of the campus as well as provide a
long felt need of a lounging place under the
trees.

The Davidson College Symphony Orches-
tra has been secured to play during com-
mencement. It will provide music for all
the public exercises and will be an attractive
feature of the season. The orchestra has had
a successful season with the Glee Club and
is considered one of the best of its kind
among the/colleges of North Carolina.

At the class meeting held Monday morning
the valedictorian, salutatorian and orator for
the class day exercises were elected and will
be announced in the next issue of The David-
sonian, At this time the class mascot was
also elected.

Several classes are planning to have re-
unions this year. One of the most notable
is the class of 1906. Prof, E. J. Erwin was
president of this class its Senior year and
will preside at the reunion, Among the
members are Mr. F. L. Jackson and Drt B.
R. Lacy, of Atlanta.

As usual the Senior Oratorical Contest will
‘be one of the main features of commence-
ment, This year there are four excellent
speakers to compete for the medal, namely,
Roland B, Parker, president of the class; A.
H. Hollingsworth, A. Y. Bowie, and B. U.
Ratchford, All these men have been inter-
collegiate debaters and made unusual forensic
and oratorical records,

STEP RIGHT UP AND MEET

Who is Louise Brooks? In New York,

if one asks that question he is verbally

guillotined for lack of knowledge. One

gets something like this in reply,—“You !
don’t know Louise Brooks? She’s the cute

little brunette who made such a hit, danc- |
ing in ‘Louie the 14th’ last year. And |
since then, they tell me, she has appeared

in a picture called ‘The American Venus.’

Louise was one of the prize beauties, and
now, she’s been signed to a long term!
contract.”

All of which, while a bit sketchy, is
exactly what has happened to Miss
| Louise Brooks. If there are such things
as meteoric rises in the film world, she
|has had one. And to set any anxious
iminds at rest, her latest role is that of
the pretty manicurist who becomes a
stage star, in Adolphe Manjou’s latest
picture for Paramount, “A Social Cele-
brity,” now playing at the Imperial.

Malcolm St. Claire, the director, pre-
dicts great things for the little lady,
claiming that she has a “certain some-
thing” which succeeds in getting over.
Certainly, to be fe at ured opposite
Adoiphe Menjou in her second picture, is
a big achievement, and there aren’t many
girls who can placé their records next to
hers.

Lochinvar Jack Causey, model of youthful
beauty, is said to be a strong contender for
the endurance championship of Davidson
College. It is rumored about the campus

his usual spirit of courageous adventure, was
