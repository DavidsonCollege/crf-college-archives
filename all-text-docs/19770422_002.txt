Colostomy
Snowfails to produce reality

By STEPHANIE COOK
Staff Writer
Senior Tony Snow, editor of
Davidson’s would-be under-
ground newspaper The Colo-
stomy, has declared its status
for this year to be ‘“‘dead’’.

The Colostomy was to be an
unofficial publication of Dav-
idson, satirizing contemporary
life.

Snow noted that the ‘diff-

’ erence between an existential-
ist and a satarist is that the
satirist hasn’t given up on the
world. He chooses to laugh
about it rather than shoot
himself.’”’

One of The Colostomy’s
goals was to examine the pri-
orities people set in life and
treat them humorously. ‘‘Peo-
ple’s priorities are so fouled up
that it’s fun to take shots at
them,’’ Snow remarked.

The paper would also have
included. journalistic cliches
(the ‘Whatever happened to
ssdee ?” series) and interviews
with small children on com-
plex contemporary issues
(‘‘What do you think about
the SALT talks?” being asked
of seven- and eight-year-olds).

“One of the problems this
place has is the alarming
paucity of creative enter-

prise,’’ Snow declared. He
stressed that he didn’t want
The Colostomy to be a ‘‘rag-
sheet’’ of Davidson—‘‘You
can see that sort of stuff in the
johns.”

Snow’s good intentions and
ideas, however, did not result
in a finished product.

According to Snow, The
Colostomy failed because ev-
eryone was more interested in
writing something that was
funny rather than putting in
the hard work and organiza-
tion which the publication
demanded.

_ People were lost in their
“beatific visions” of writing
for an underground newspa-
per. ‘‘It requires not being
afraid to stick your neck out
and get people mad at you,’’
Snow said.

Other problem areas were
finding a printer and creating
a functional organizational
framework within which to
channel the creativity.

The Colostomy’s fund-rais-
ing success in the fall proved
that there was interest and
enthusiasm for the paper on
campus, Snow said. About
100 subscriptions were sold at
$3 apiece.

Snow announced that the

Although it failed this year,
Snow would like to see an
underground paper organized
in the future. He derived
personal satisfaction from the
experience. It was a creative
outlet —‘‘an excuse to write
the sort of things I wanted to
do”’ as well as being just ‘‘fun
to try”’.

Consider merit admissions

Groups study coeducation

By PAM CAMERRA
Staff Writer

Two committees are re-,
searching the costs and prob-
lems of coeducation and ad-
missions at Davidson, and will
make recommendations to the
Board of Trustees, at their
May 7 meeting.

The Coeducation Evalu-
ation Committee, a faculty-
student subcommittee of the
Council on Campus and Reli-
gious Life is researching the
changes resulting from the
shift to co-education in 1972.

The committee is examining
the costs that have been
incurred and the future costs
that would ensue if the percen-
tage of women is increased.

The Committee divided the
school up into several broad
areas, including the Infir-
mary, Physical Education
Department, the Patterson
Court Council, Academics,
and the physical plant of the
school, to name a few. Faculty
and staff members were asked
to evaluate the impact of
coeducation in their particular
area.

Most of those questioned
said that coeducation has not
brought many cost or policy
changes. Although . physical
education and IMAC sports
were not generally affected,
Director of Athletics Thomas
Cartmill said that it would be
harder for Davidson College to
compete in intercollegiate
sports, especially football, if
women’s enrollment increased.
and the number of males

r

decreased.

The six-member student
Committee on Sex Blind Ad-
missions is considering the
consequences of adopting a
merit based admissions policy.
The Committee developed a
survey with the help of Pro-
fessor Kelton which has been
distributed to 250 randomly
selected students and 118
faculty members and admini-
strators.

The survey _ includes
questions on the size of enrol-
ment, the percentage of males
and females, and whether or
not Davidson should reserve
1000 places for men regardless
of female enrollment (in order
to preserve tradition). The
Committee also hopes to
determine the degree of sup-
port for the sex blind admis-
sions policy.

“We're trying to allay some
of the fears of the trustees,”’
said Ellen‘Stebbins, a member
of both Committees.

“If we go to a sex blind
system, the trustees are afraid
of having a class of 80 percent
women, of less donations from
women alumni, and of
breaking Davidson’s tradi-
tions.”

“In the beginning I thought
no one would be against
accepting more girls because
the current ratio seems to be
the crux of a lot of social
problems and increasing the
ratio would seem to me to
make the campus more natu-
ral.

““Yet,’’ said Stebbins, ‘‘I

have run into a number of
guys who would like to keep
the ratio the same and even a
few who would like no women
here.

‘Most women would like to
see an increase in the ratio. In
fact, none that I have talked
to.are against sex blind ad-
missions up to a 50/50 ratio,”’
she said.

Admissions Counselor Tony
Boon told the Sex Blind
Admissions Committee that
even if the Class of 1981 had
been evaluated on a sex blind
base, not more than about 40
or more women would have
been accepted. He thinks that
a class of 80 percent women
would be far-fetched since
men’s applications traditional-
ly have and should continue to
eutnumber women’s applica-

ns.

The Committee on Sex
Blind Admissions will give
their data to the Coeducation
Evaluation Committee which
will use this material along
with its own in drafting \a
recommendation for the Coun-
cil on Campus and Religious
Life. The Council will then
present this recommendation
to the Board of:Trustees.

The Committee on Sex
Blind Admissions is gathering
information from other col-
leges and universities which
have recently gone coedu-
cational. It will use the survey
results and data from other
colleges to make a separate
recommendation on the sex
blind admissions policy to the
Board of Trustees.
