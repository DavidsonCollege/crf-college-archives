SPECS AND SOME FOLKS

THAT HIDE BEHIND THEM

_ By A, SPECTATOR
1 For some indescribable reason, personally
I like to place it on overstudy, but my theory
doesn’t seem to meet with the approval and
sanction of public opinion, and for this rea-
son it cannot be pushed to the utmost of its
possibilities as I should like, fate deemed it
fit to bless: me with the need of glasses.
I thought the matter over pro and con and
came to the conclusion that this would for-
ward my theory, so I responded to ee |
suggestion.

Having decided who was to have the |
privilege of draping my face, I went to him
feeling confident that he would agree with
me that I needed glasses. Seldom does he
go against such inclinations, even if he has |
to go to the extent of perching a small clip |
of framed window pane on one’s nose.

It was my first offense, but he treated me |
just like one of his old stand-bys. The one |
part I didn’t mind was when that nice lady |
put those drops in my eyes, She could have |
kept on doing that forever. For a while
I thought that was all here was to it. I later
found out that that was only the prelim- ,
inaries for the beginning. It reminded me |
of what my kid brother said about school— '
the only part he liked about it was recess.
This was my recess. Work was to begin
in a few minutes.

Then the man came and took me into all
the little rooms, one by one, and I told him | &
everything he asked me.

I watched the little red dot move, etc. |
After he had done everything he could think | }
of doing, he wrote down my name and
address.

While in a state of partial blindness, due |

he asked me to select the frames I preferred.
Presuming that weak eyes needed exercise,
I picked out rather heavy, large ones.

I couldpicture a hundred sympathetic eyes
shedding their blessing and best wishes on
me as I crossed the main street with those
things on. But I saw no escape.

After a few days, however, -the regular
wind-shields came and I put aside those
tinted ornaments.
After heing brought date contact with
