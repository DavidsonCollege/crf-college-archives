“CAT TALES

y MAC HART

The biggest sports story of the week finds the Red and
Black machine journeying to Norfolk, hometown of many of
the Wildcat huskies, to challenge the Conference favorite
William and Mary Indians. The fact that the Cats have been
preparing for this bout for almost a year and that seven
members of the squad will be performing before a hometown
crowd, puts added drive into the Cat attack. Easy Rhodes,
Sandy Carnegie, Hal Mapes, Bill Boyd, Buddy Chandler,
Johnny Richards, and Rhea Adams Will be making what is
for many of them their first postwar gridiron appearance
on their old stamping ground.

However, last year’s Southern Conference
runners up will be no pushover for any team
with husky fullback Jack (Flying) Cloud, also
of Norfolk, spearheading the attack. It will take
all of the ’Cats vaunted ground defense to stop
Cloud and his cohorts long enough to edge in
some scoring of their own.

Last weeks 19-0 victory over Elon came as a
surprise in many quarters, in spite of Coach
Storey’s warnings that it would be no sure win.
The statistics show that the ’Cats, as of old have
plenty of drive, but often lack the necessary
punch to hit paydirt.

But for a spectacular second quarter, the Red and Black
Machine looked good but not flashy. That second quarter
team was one that could bode evil to the best of them.

The whole squad is in excellent shape. With two excep-
tions, they are free from injuries, and we sincerely hope that
they can»emerge as well from the William and Mary fray.
Tackle Sandy Carnegie is suffering from a minor knee injury,
but wild horses couldn’t keep him out of the Norfolk scrap.

, Dave Poole is also laid up with a bum knee and may not see
_action tomorrow.

After the N. C. State game in Charlotte next
week-end, the schedule is strategically arranged
and we predict a better than .500 average.

Furman’s bang-up scrap with Georgia adds to
the dark clouds hanging over the season. Pre-
season moanings from the Furman camp fooled
many, but the Furman team that came close to
drubbing Wally Butt’s crew cannot help but be
a big improvement over last year. Add to this
the Thanksgiving, Homecoming advantage ‘and
Furman begins to look like a mighty high
hurdle for the ’Cats. ‘

Congratulations to the six freshmen who crashed a well-
padded varsity roster. Namely, Dave Poole, Auburn Lambeth,
Hoopy Davis; Henry Wilson, Jim Rogers, and J. C. Roberts.
All these boys had brilliant high school careers ahd should
prove equally successful in college circles.

Several other Wildcat sports already have begun or are
in the process of beginning. Junior varsity football is off
to a good start under the capable direction of Al Moneyhan.
Their schedule, already lined up, includes six games, five of
them at home and one in Charlotte.

Some of the tennis regulars have been work-
ing out with Coach Barton, new tennis coach.
Coach Whittle’s new cross-country team is or-
ganized and asking for candidates — a fine
chance for trackmen to keep in shape. Wrest-
ling starts officially in about a week. Intra-
mural football teams are squaring away for
their opening games next week.

As Wildcat sports begin to roll, your sports staff is
sharpening for action. Yours truly, along with veteran re-
porters Chuck Cunningham, Jack Hazard, and Dick Morgan
will be assisted by freshmen Bill, King, Furman Warlick,
Gordon Scott, and GenesRegen. We will welcome additions
to our staff, especially members of the various squads.

We will not try to present sports stories so much as news,
since we realize that the student body will get the scores
much quicker than we can get it to them. Our goal will rather
be to acquaint the student body with their teams and sports
personalities because we feel that the student body should
know and support their teams better.

Underway Tuesday

Next Tuesday the curtain goes

up on the 1947 intramural sports
program. The season gets off with
a bang with ten fraternities and
the Independents — pitting — their
brains and brawn against each
other in the game of touch foot-
ball. With a full schedule of .55
games on tap, the student body |

here at Davidson can look forward

to a big season of intramural

sports.

There are certain standard regu-
lations of touch football which will
be used again this fall. The dimen-
sions of the field are 360 feet by
160 feet, with zones of 18 yards

The Wildcats opened their 1947 grid season with a not too impressive
19-0 victory over Elon College. Only in the second quarter, when all
three ‘Cat markers were tallied, did they look like the offensive team that
will upsét William and Mary this week, The Red and Black line, however,

Javees Look Good in Scrimmage

On Tuesday of this week, after
a week of conditioning, the Wild-
kitten’ went up to scrimmage the
varsity. Fullback Sam Joyner and
Pete Lrown, end from last year’s
squad, looked particularly good in
touchdowns against — the
“Big Boys.” John “Stubby” Evans
and Amos Camp stood out at their
guard posts and John Hay did well
at center. The tackle slots seem to
be in good hands with Andy Horne
and ©, C. Howard. In the back-
field’Gene Crooks led the blocking
backs and Charlie Baldwin paced
the wingbacks.

A schedule of six games has been
lined up for the '47 edition of the
Wildkittens and the remaining
open dates will soon be filled later,
it is hoped. The schedule is as fol-

Nov. 1—CC-UNC.
Nov. 7—Blue Ridge.

Nov. 21—Open.
All of these games are daytime
home games with the exception of
the CCUNC game which will be
played in Charlotte the night of
Homecoming. :
