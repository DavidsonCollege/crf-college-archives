Creative Cash

- The activities fund proposed to the
Student Council Tuesday night is a
program with great potential. Inherent
in it are some very optimistic assump-
tions about the students. but these
presuppositions are. to a certain de-
gree, justified.

Anvone who has occasion to talk to
a wide range of Davidson students is
aware of the fact that some of the
most creative ideas are found in stu-
dents who has no “in” with the exist
ing student organizations. Lacking this
string to pull. it is difficult for them
to draw out the money needed to im-
plement their ideas.

One of the problems faced by such
students is that of persuading an or-
ganization that the idea they have is
worth that organization's money. This
problem will remain in some form or
another whether the individual is seek-
ing funds from an organization or the
activities fund. It is only reasonable
for either source to ask for fairly de-
tailed planning including a projection
of the effects of a new proposal.

There is. however, an additional
problem in going to an existing stu-
dent organization for aid in imple-
menting a proposal. Yearly budgets
for’ student organizations are pretty
well set by the end of October. even
before this date for most of them.

After the vear's budget has been set
by an organization, it is extremely dif-
ficult for it to find the money to sup-
port any new programs proposed to it
later in the year One effect of imple-
menting the Blue Sky curriculum is
sure to be that all organizational bud-
gets will be pared of anything re-
sembling fat in order to give the col-
lege the money it needs for new pro-
fessors. equipment. etc.

One benefit of the activities fund
then will be to make possible pro-
grams that organizations just cannot
finance. This, however, will not be the
most important benefit of the fund if
it really becomes a growing concern.

One of the reasons that some of our
most imaginative students do not have
an “in” into organizations here is that
many of them have a real distrust of
these organizations. Organizations
have a tendency to become self-limit-
ing institutions instead of productive
channels for creativity,

Setting up an activities fund will
allow students to conceive and bring
to fruition a particular program with-
out strangling them in the ties of an
organization. Not only does the activi-
ties fund make possible activities that
are not possible in the present organ-
izational svstem. it also mav stimulate
students whose ideas have lain dor-
mant.

The success of the activities fund.

oresupvoses that there are students
here who would be interested in tak-
ing advantage of its finances. This
assumption is debatable, but the suc
ces of such student-initiated programs
as the student recruiting program and
the Student Tutorial Educational Pro-
ject would seem to indicate that it has
some validity.

Whether the fund is a success will
depend on whether or not it is used.
If we assume that there rae students
around who will be interested in fi-
nancing their pet dreams. then the
question becomes one of whether
these students will be aware of the
existence of the fund. The biggest
problem for the fund may turn out to
be honking its own horn enough to
remind students that it is available.

Reading The Funnies

It’s not often that events at David-
son parallel events in the outside
world. .

But ast week a dent was made in
the college’s walls of pastoral aca-
demic seclusion.

Anv avid reader of the “Li'] Abner”
comic strip \if there are any) knows
that Al Capp currently has the gov-
ernment trying to satisfy the appetites
of a fictional developing country. the
national food of which is prime rump

We do not care to debate the sig-
nificance of Davidson choosing to
copy the action of a comic strip as its
bit of participation in the world out-
side, but the college’s own rump hunt,
does. bear comment.

The object of our own hunt is the

identification of the authors of the .

Rump Committee on Seriousness of
Purpose, Concision. and Precision at
Davidson College. In case anyone has
forgotten, this is the group that satar-
ized the faculty advisory committee’s
criteria for a new president for the
college last week.

Since the Rump Committee's mem
orandum appeared. cries have come
from all sides of the college communi-
ty denouncing the bit of satire. Parti-
cularly frustrating to these critics is
the fact that they do not have anyone
to blame because the memorandum's
claim to have been written bv the col-
lege’s janitorial] and custodial staff
seems patently. false.

We agree that the members of the
Rump Committee were being coward-
ly in not revealing their identities.
but somehow we just cannot get very
upset about their memorandum. It
van hardly be called overly disturbing
even though its humor was somewhat
heavy-handed’ and perhaps even ill-
advised.

Selecting a new president is always
one of the most serious jobs to face a
college community But if these in-
volved in the selection process at Da-
vidson have lost the ability to laugh
at themselves. then maybv all of us
should go back to reading comic strips

Examining Exams

Although we sympathize deeply
with the student who has to wait un-
necetssarily until March 23 to take re-
exams for first semester work, it
seems a shame to us that this question
has come to dominate the debate over
the exam system:

Being forced to wait until the first
dav of spring break is. of course, an
exorbitant price to pay for having had
to miss an exam at the first time it
was administered.

A favorite review-giving time is the
week preceding spring break. It is
very unfa‘r to expect a student to take
an examination on material almost
two months oid when he does not have
ample opportunity to study for the
exam in the week preceding it.

The besi way to get around this
problem. however. is not just moving
the re-exam date around a little. The
exam period itself needs to be struc-
tured to allow students to take exam
inations according to the schedule
that is the most agreeable with the
course load of the individual student.

Under the present system. all mem-
bers of one class take the exam at
the same time (unless the professor
has more than one section of the same
course in which case a student may
elect to take his exam with another
section). Although an effort seems to
be made to schedule examination
hours in such a way as to prevent
bunching of the times at which popu-
lar courses are taught, it is still not
unusual for a student to wait a week
before taking any serious exams. Then
he may easily wind up having to take
three or four exams in two days.

What we need to do is to take a
little more advantage of our honor
system. A file of all exams for the
semester could be administered by
the Student Government Association.
When a student was ready to take a

certain exam, he could check ti out
from fhe file and complete it within
an appropriate time limit.

Such systems have worked success-
fully at other schools Students. like
have said they like the system because
it allows them to avoid bunching up
their exams. Such a system would also
eliminate the problem of having to
take re-exams two months after the
end of the semester

Although this system lets professors
get out of having to be present to ad-
minister an exam at a certain time.
one problem for the facultv has crop-
ped up at Haverford. Randolph-Macon
Woman's College and Sweetbriar
where similar systems have been in
use for several years.

_ Because some people will procras
tinate about anything. the faculty has
been faced with the problem of stu-
dents waiting until the last few days
of the exam period to take all of their
exams. This has meant that profes-
sors are then stuck with a large num-
ber of exams to grade in a short per-
iod in order to get their course grades
in on time.

_ This problem could be avoided if
intermediate deadlines for certain
types of courses were set within the
exam period time limits. Since semin-
ar exams are likely to involve a lot
of reading for the grader. a deadline
could be set requiring that type of
exam to be taken within the first third
of the exam period.

Another possibility that should be
considered in re-studying the exam-
ination system is the one just adopted
at Vanderbilt. In certain cases, seniors
there are allowed to skip their final
exams. Professors at Davidson have
been known to do this on the sly, but
there is no reason why it could not
become a general policy for certain
students.

If you all can do so well
in raising money to rebuild
Chambers. I am sure you
have the ability to find donors
for a program which will
do far more for Davidson in
the long run than will the
benefits accrued by installing
air conditioning. ‘

In this time of international
crisis. with America getting
itself. involved in everyone
else's affairs. I think it a
matter of urgent priority
that Davidson adopt an inter
nationalist attitude to prove
to the world that the average
American student is not an
isolationist. when it comes to
the point of furthering the
cause of education.

Secondly. do I ‘sense a new
wave of liberal views seep
ing into the campus? as. a
member of the executive staf
belonging to the Peace in

I often wonder if American
students fully realize the von-
cern ‘there is amongst Euro.

No Complaints

As incredible and entirely against tradition as it
may seem in you who eagerly peruse this side of the
editorial page each week in search of the latest exposi-
tion of the stupidity of the faculty, the administration,
the students, the trustees, President Johnson, etc., I
must admit that it was impossible for me to find any-
thing this week even half-way significant to complain
about.

Part of this dearth of material for complaint is
due to the fact that most of the big issues of student-
administration disagreement at Davidson have been
solved or compromised. Part of it is also due to the
advent of spring and a general unwillingness on cam-
pus either to look for issues or to debate them. To put
it bluntly. no one really gives a damn about anything
much these days. ;

Which is why it seems like a good time to com

ment on a few things, “good and bad,” none of which
is worthwhile enough to merit a whole column by it-
self. First gripe of the day is that to date there seems
to have been no serious thought given to the proposal
that instead of just looking for a new president to take
Dr. Martin’s place, the faculty and trustees concern
themselves with creating two separate offices, those of
President and Chancellor, one to handle fund raising
and the other to tend to more academic matters. What
good will it do Davidson if she gets a first rate presi-
dent who is forced to perform a second rate job in
each of these areas simply because he doesn’t have the
time to devote his full energies to either one or the
other? After a year or two of supervising the escala-
tion of Davidson’s own war on poverty and archaic
academics, Dean Rusk—should he be the next pres—
would be more than glad to get back into the State
Department.
' Another gripe, and a much more personal one,
concerns the non-existence of a warning light or cross-
bar at the railroad tracks on the street in back of card-
board village. For some time there have been com-
plaints about the absence of such a warning, but no one
ever pays any attention to them unless he himself is
involved. Having come close to being wiped out early
one morning last week by good old 1:18 as she balled
her way to Mooresville I can now appreciate the prob-
lem. ‘And I’m far from being the first one to come
close to getting a cow-catcher in the head—just a year
or two ago a train caught a professor’s car and dragged
it with his family in it a hundred or so yards, and by
the time he got through trying to collect for damages
from the railroad he was glad they weren't charged
for the ride.

_ [realize the power of the railroad lobbies in Ra-
leigh and understand their reluctance to spend 20 or
so thousand dollars to install and maintain a warning ©
light at every crossing in the state, but one that is as
well travelled as is the one in Davidson deserves some
sort of protection. But railroads will continue to save
money by ignoring near-misses like mine until some
pood clod greases the tracks from here to Mooresville.
and then a warning light might be considered—pro-
viding, of course, that the town of Davidson makes an
adequate contribution.

But. I’m glad to be able to report, not all that has
happened lately falls in the bad news category. Take
the new non-deferment policy for post graduates, for
example. What a terrific way to boost the standing of
the ROTC department on campus while at the same
time making it easier for those of us who are already
in advanced ROTC to get into a good grad school be-
cause no one else will be able to go until they have
served their time. And it will effectively weed out all
those boys who really aren’t interested in grad school
at all but are just trying to avoid the draft.

All in all the decision was a stroke of genius on
Gen. Hershey’s part. And the best part of it all was
pointed out last Saturday by Betty Vetter, executive
director of the Scientific Manpower Commission, who
acutely observed that the U.S. Army will now be “the
best educated Army in history.” Somehow, though, 1
don’t think it will make much difference to the average
VC whether the American soldier he just killed had
his PhD or not—but it may make a great deal of dif-
ference to America.

Fill ‘er up. It’s a long drive home.
