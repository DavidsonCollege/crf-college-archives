Netters head Southern Conference

By MARK SCANDLING
Staff Writer

Last week’s 6-3 victory over
Harvard University trans-
formed the Davidson Tennis
Team’s season from a good
one, into what Coach Jeff
Frank hopes will be a great
one.

The team followed up its
victory over Ivy League com-
petition with two important
wins over Southern Confe-
rence opposition. The team
downed The Citadel 6-3 Sat-
urday, and they upset power-
house Furman U. 5-4 Monday.

These two victories vaulted
Davidson to the top of the
Southern Conference stand-
ings with a 3-0 record.

The match with Harvard
was a turnaround point in the
season according to Frank
because “‘it was the first time

the doubles actually won a .

match for us.’’ After the
singles the score was tied 3-3,
and the doubles were crucial
for they would determine the
outcome of the match.

The Cats withstood the
pressure, and swept all three
doubles to secure a 6-3 vic-
tory.

A weekend trip to Charle-
ston to face the Citadel Bull-
dogs proved fruitful for the
Cats. The team came home
with a 6-3 victory, over one of
the top four teams in the
conference.

Frank felt the match was

important, for it was the
team’s first tough away match
of the season.
‘ Chip Bndurant and Mike
Barnhill both lost their singles
matches, but the Cats swept
the remaining four singles
matches to take a 4-2 lead into
the doubles.

Once again the doubles were
crucial, because they would
determine the outcome of the
match.

Stan Boswell and Chip
Bondurant teamed up to win
the No. 1 doubles match in the
third set. However, they did it
the hard way, as they found
themselves behind 4-2 in the

tie breaker. Behind Bondu-
rant’s power serve, they won
three straight points to edge
the Bulldogs 5-4.

This victory by the 1975
Conference runnerup No. 1
doubles clinched the match for
Davidson.

Coach Frank’s biggest thrill
as a coach, was winning the
Conference championship in
his first year as coach at
Davidson. But Monday’s
stunning upset of the Purple
Paladens: from Furman is his
greatest satisfaction from a
single match effort.

The netters had been look-
ing forward to the Furman
match all year. Furman is this
year’s conference powerhouse
(they already defeated Appa-
lachian State, the 1975 confe-

rence champs) and the Cats
were gunning for the upset.
Everyone performed super-
bly in defeating Furman, but
Frank singled out the perfor-
mance of No.2 singles player
Barnhill. Frank termed Barn-
hill’s victory as ‘‘one of the
highlights of the season.”
Barnhill’s opponent was
Hap Core, last year’s No. 1
high school player in N.C.
Barnhill played smart and
consistent tennis to defeat
Core in straight sets 6-2, 7-6
John Mitchell, who has the
best record on the team, and
Steve Homan, also defeated
tough opponents. These victo-
ries sent the Cats into the
doubles round in a 3-3 tie.

24 teams compete
in Davidson relays

By DAVE KELLER
Features Editor

This Saturday the Heath
Whittle Track will be the scene
of the 17th Annual Davidson
Relays Track Meet.

With 24 teams entered, this
year’s meet will be the largest
yet, and, according to track
coach Sterling Martin, ‘‘prob-
ably will be the biggest track
meet ever held in this area.”’

Based on previous perform-
ances, some of the strongest
teams competing will be Ap-
palachian State, Berry Col-
lege, V.M.I., and Towson
State. Other teams entered

proved to be too much for their
Furman opponents, as they
won the N. 1 doubles in three
sets.

Homan and Steve Johnson
form the No. 3 doubles, and
they won in straight sets,
giving the Cats a 5-4 victory.

Frank feels the team peaked
against Furman, and that it
would be hard for the them to

play much better.

The netters cannot afford to
slide from their peak form, as
tough matches with Appa-
lachian, and Richmond loom
ahead in the near future,
according to Frank.

include The Citadel, Wake
Forest, Georgia State, and
defending champion Western
Carolina.

Included in.the meet for the
first time this year will be the
440-yard intermediate hurd-
les, the masters mile for men
over 30 and seven womens’
events. The events for women,
which will be scored on an
individual basis only and not
by team, include the 100 yard
dash, 440-yard run, 880 yard
run, mile run, 880-yard relay,
long jump and high jump.

About the Wildcat’s chan-
ces, Martin said ‘‘we should
have a number of strong
individual perfomances, al-
though I don’t believe we will
win.”’

Davidson won the meet the
first five years of its existence,
but the Cats have only won
once since then.

Some of Davidson’s top
performers this year will be
Doug Horne in the steeple-
chase, Fred Borch and Coty
Pinckney in the six-mile, and
John Stanfield in the high
jump.

Also for the first time this
year the general public will be
charged admission, $1.00. for
adults and $.50 for children;
Davidson students with I.D.’s
get in free. The meet will begin-
at 9:30 A.M. and coach Mar-
tin urges anyone who would
like to help officiate and set up
the meet to see him.
