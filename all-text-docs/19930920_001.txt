College to install voice mail system for campus phones
New system will eliminate need for personal answering machines

By Katherine Hash

Beginning October 19,
Davidson faculty, staff, and stu-
dents will be served by a new Octel
Maxum SE voice processing sys-
tem. The new system, to be in-
stalled over fall break, will con-
nect more than 2,000 people to-
gether through Southern Bell’s
central office equipment in
Davidson.

According to Bob Stephenson,
Director of Administrative Ser-
vices, the decision to implement
the new system was made follow-

ing increasing faculty/staff and
departmental demands for a more
efficient alternative to answering
machines.

The college decided to include
students in the system rather than
restricting access to faculty and
staff because the system is more
cost effective when implemented
campus wide.

The system will retain fea-
tures of Davidson’s currentsystem
including call back, three way call-
ing, and call forwarding. In addi-
tion, the voice processing system

will provide “voice mail boxes”
for every telephone line. Mes-
sages can be left and retrieved from
any phone line on or off campus.
Acaller has the option of send-
ing a message directly to the voice
mail box or dialing the room and
leaving amessage in the box which
willact as an answering machine if
no one answers. A “stutter” dial
tone will inform users that there
are messages in their boxes.
Students sharing a telephone
line will each have their own box
insuring a confidentiality and cer-

tainty of receiving messages not
possible when roommates share an
answering machine.

Faculty departments, college
offices, and selected student of-
fices will have access to a variety
of other services including an au-
tomated answerer feature which
would direct callers to.a menu of
features. Stephenson hopes that
this feature will enable callers to
getthe information they needmore
readily.

He expects this feature to be
used frequently in the athletic and

admissions offices where callers
might be instructed to “dial 1 to
place orders for NCAA soccer tick-
ets” or “dial 1 to request an appli-
cation.” Telephone menus will
include up to four options with
option one being the most popular
and option four offering connec-
tion with “a friendly human voice”
in the office.

Another feature allows the
caller to record a message to be
sent simultaneously toa previously
identified distribution list, or group

Lunar Luau kicks off festivities on Richardson Field

By Court McBryde

The student Union sponsored
the Lunar Luau on Friday night,
September 17. All students and
faculty were welcome to the festi-
val including games, food, and
music. Lunar Luau has become a
tradition at Davidson College
“serving as a kick-off for many
aspects of the Davidson College
life,” according to student chair of
the Union Board Merrill Earnest.

The activity operated asa pre-
lude and catalyst to the freshmen’s
first night down on Patterson Court,
the upcoming athletic season, and
other Union sponsored events for
the entire campus. Earnest com-
ments that there are few times on
campus when independents, Patter-
son Court houses, faculty, and
freshmen can get together and have
fun; this activity’s general purpose
was to cater to that need.

Rain was in the forecast for
Friday night, but stopped in time
for most of the activities of Lunar
Luau to remain on Richardson
Field. At 10 p.m. Richardson Field
began to fill up with students and
’ faculty who intended to get a taste
of Lunar Luau.

Most houses on Patterson
_ Court were represented with a

booth. Kappa Sig had a dunking
booth; SAE sponsored paddle ball
and sold T-shirts; Phi Delt had a
baseball machine; while Fiji and
Sig Ep’s activities were unidentifi-
able.

Inside Johnston Gym other
activities took place such as KA’s
shootout, Pika’s cotton candy ser-
vice, and an obstacle course. Other
activities included the cosmic or-
bital, ultimate frisbee, and volley-
ball on the field. Free food was

everywhere and musicblared from
some student DJs. The annual fall
Wildcats Pep Rally before the Lu-
nar Luau was postponed to another
date due to rain.

The next big union sponsored
campus event will be “The Day at
the Lake” on Saturday, September
25. Earnest said that this day will
be similar to last year with food,
games, and sun. He urged all stu-
dents and faculty to put this date on
their calendars.

First night down excites Court

By Court McBryde

On Saturday night, Septem-
ber 18, the freshmen class was
exposed to an elementof Davidson
life they had not had the chance to
experience. The Class of ‘97 waited
three weeks until they had the op-
portunity to venture down to
Patterson Court.

This policy of having fresh-
men wait three weeks has been a
changing policy for many years
said Dean of Students Will Terry.
He claims the purpose of having
this policy is for “the freshmen to
establish their halls, settle into their
classes, and to get the feel of
Davidson College before being

thrust into the court’s mayhem.”

Dean Terry says the Patterson
Court Council (PCC) requested this
policy and presented it to the Com-
mittee for Campus and Religious
Life. Julie Petty, president of PCC,
says that the fraternities pushed for
a revised policy of a three week
freshmen waiting period because
of the rushing aspect.

In the past, a longer waiting
period of six weeks instigated a lot

ofundercover rushing. The frater-

nities and eating houses want to
avoid this situation. For the frater-
nities, first night down on Patter-

Freshmen and independent SGA
senators elected without run-offs

By Ashlyn Dannelly

For the first year, both fresh-
men and independent Student Gov-
ernment senator elections con-
cluded on the first day of voting
without runoffelections. Last Tues-
day, the freshmen elected six sena-
tors from achoice of sixteen candi-
dates; independent students had
only four candidates for the four

are: president Zik Joseph, Anne

Bartholomew, Warren Buford,

Josh Gaffga, Sara Beth Hamlin,

and Justin Paschal. The four inde-
pendent senators include: presi-

dent Brad Hilsmier, Amy Burrows,
Greg Fisher, and Heather Flint. |
According to John Philpott,
chairman of the Elections Council,
a majority of the freshman class
voted. Philpott also did not see
anything unusual about the num-
ber of candidates for both races:
“Honestly, no one was surprised

by the number of candidates. It
was a normal number.”
However, some freshmen
voiced their disapproval of the
amount of publicity the race re-
ceived. Freshman David Ross,
campaign manager for newly-
elected freshman president Zik
Joseph, said: “I’ve heard people
say, ‘What elections?’ Ithink saw

available Spots. one sign that said ‘Vote Today’.”

“posted in all the freshman dorms
as well as on the doors of Cham-
bers.”

According to Ross and fresh-
man Alice Payne, attendance at the
Candidate’s Forum in the 900
Room of the Union on Monday
night ran from twenty to forty
people. As Payne said: “There
were no announcements about the
candidate’s speeches. The only
reason I knew about them was be-
cause my roommate was running.”

Plans to light campus

By Martha Knight

Awalkaround campus at night
will soon be brighter. College ad-
ministrators have recently desig-
nated funds for new lighting in
certain areas on campus. This ac-
tion follows requests made by more
than five hundred students and fac-
ulty members.

During the spring of last year,
the SGA Committee on Campus
Security recognized a need for
improved lighting in particular lo-
cations as a deterrent for crime.
Chairman Jonathan Orr says that
he and his committee examined

the problem and felt that it was
necessary to bring to the attention
of administrators. Students re-
sponded by signing a petition and
sending letters of support to Presi-
dent John Kuykendall.

This year the committee con-
ducted a survey of 196 freshman
women who were asked to respond
to various questions concerning
their views on crime at Davidson.
Results released last week indi-
cated that personal safety was an
issue on the minds of many of the
