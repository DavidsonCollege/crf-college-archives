Or. W. M. Docherty is shown above talking to Rev. Sam Magill
and President J. R. Cunningham of Davidson during his visit here
for Fall Services. Or. Docherty, pastor of the New York Avenue
Presbyterian Church of Washington, D. ¢., spent three days on the
campus, delivering a series of five sermons centering around the
general topic “Concerning the Faith.” He left immediately after
his sermon Tuesday night to return to his parish.

Rev. Thomas Allan To
Speak To Student Body

The Reverend Thomas Allan, M.A., will speak to the
student body in Chapel Tuesday. He is to be in Mooresville as
the Ashlin White Lecturer for the First Presbyterian Church.

Rev. Allan was born at New-
milns, Ayrshire, Scotland. He grad-
uated from Glasgow University in
1838, with the degree of M.A., with
First Class Honors in English lan-
guage and literature. In 1939 he
decided to enter the ministry and
enrolled at Trinity College, Glas-
gow.

In 1940 he entered the R.AF. as
a combatant. Two years later he
was commissioned and served in
the Intelligence Department, in
SHAEF, Paris, directly under Air
Commander Tedder and General
Eisenhower. To quote Mr. Allan:
“I do not feel that I will be a
stranger in the States. During the
war it was my privilege to be on
President Eisenhower's staff as an
Intelligence Officer, and it was
through an unknown (to me)
American Negro soldier singing a
spiritual at service in Reims that
I was called back to the Faith after
years of wandering in darkness and
doubt.”

Mr. Allan returned to his theo-
logical studies at Glasgow in 1947.
Upon completing his divinity
course he was called as minister
of the Church of Scotland to the
North Kelvinside Parish, Glasgow.
North Kelvinside was a congrega-
tion of some 400 and a parish con-
sisting of tenements and working
class people. His aim was to be
the minister of the parish and to
train the laity to be the striking
force through prayer, Bible study,
fellowship and action. His efforts
have produced a congregation of
1300 today.

As of the first ot September,
1953, Mr. Allan has been called by
the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland as Evangelist
for the Church of Scotland. Accord-
ing to Mr. Allan, this is a three-
year appointment, in which his
main concern will be to prepare
the ground in Scotland for a na-
tional movement of Protestant
Churches of Scotland, the “Tell
Scotland Movement” scheduled for
1955-56, in which all the resources
of the Churches and the British
Broadcasting Corporation will be
used to bring the challenge of the
Gospel to the people of Scotland
in every department of their na-
tional life.

As a member of the Preparatory
Study Commission on Evangelism
he will attend the next World
Council of Churches Assembly at
Evanston, Ilinois in the summer of
1064. He has specialized in the
New Evengelism Movement iw the
Church of Scotland and is an
authority’ on parishmissions and
missionary methods of the
Churches of Europe. His book on
this subject will be published early
next year by the Student Christian
Movement Press.

Mr. Allan comes to Davidson
highly recommended by Dr. George
M. Docherty, our Fall Services
speaker.

In 1952, the United Community
Services, of which the United Ap-
peal is a committee, was estab-
lished.

The United Appeal Committee
sponsors the annual campaign for
the gathering of funds for the
various community services, such
as the American Red Cross, the
Amerigan Heart Association, the
Mecklenburg Association for the
Blind, and many other such in-
dispensable services.

Rather than have a_ separate
drive for each of the 42 agencies
represented, a single, all-inclusive
campaign is held, thus saving both
money and time on the campaigns,
in addition to the convenience to
the individual.

This year, the appeal will be
operated through the fraternities.
Although an individual solicitation
will not be made, the non-frater-
nity members of the school will
be given an opportunity to give
to the fund,

he has led the way for many a

We can certainly feel confident
that Bob will have his position well

Washington and Lee, and know
that he will continue the sterling
play which he has given the Wild-

Pete also broke the old record.

Rowland-Thacker TD
A Bill Rowland-Jim Thacker pass
play accounted for the only Da-
vidson score of the game. Rowland

heaved the ball to Thacker, who:

gathered it in and went all the
way, with the play covering fifty-
five yards.

Other than the scoring play, the
Davidson offense was held well in
check by the Harvard team. The
Wildcats could manage only six
first downs against the Crimsons’
ine.

Washington and Lee’s champion-
ship team of several years ago is
gone, and they have had rough
going on the gridiron this season.
The Generals won their opening
scrap of the season, taking a de-
cision over Shepherd State. Since
then, the team has lost to Mary-
land, North Carolina, West Vir.
ginia, Richmond, Virginia Tech,
gnd George Washington.

Lost to Colonials

Last Saturday, the Washington
and Lee team gave George Wash.
ington a real battle for three
quarters, leading, 7-6, in the third
period, But the Colonials turned
on the steam in the final minutes
to win, 25-7,

It was another of the last half
losses that have. plagued the Gen.
erals this season. They have played
fine football in the first half of
their games, only to lose when
their lack of depth began to show.
Injuries which have hounded the
W&L team have made this more
noticeable.

Washington and Lee has a big
team, especially from tackle to
tackle. Captain Bill McHenry, 215-
pound center, has been a standout
in the line, while Joe Lindsey has
shown up well for the Generals
in the quarterback slot and should
do a lot of throwing tomorrow.

dication that any action will be
taken concerning chapel policy.
But it is true that the members
of the faculty and administration
are thinking seriously about the
problem, and some of them are
entertaining the idea of making
changes in policy. Whether or not
changes are to come, no Cte can
say. It does seem, however, that
some sort of revision of chapel
policy is highly desirable, that
something should be done in an

attempt to enable the students to
get more out of meeting together
five times every week..

the work that the staff has to do
in the coming months.

CATTALES...

W. Va., with 8 of the 10 conference teams participating, we
see a good possibility of the Cats traveling into the hills come
next March.

On the casual glance, however, the Wildcat prospectus
for the coming season might still be considered very dismal.
With the leading scorer gone and no new men whatsoever
on a squad which could manage only four wins last season
one might be led to forecast another victory-starved Davidson
team.

Seasoned Team, Better Schedule Boost Cat Hopes

However, Coach Miller expresses great enthusiasm over _
this year’s prospects. With a lighter load as far as the schedule
goes and some great improvement on the part of the boys,
optimism is the word around the Johnston Gym boards. “The
boys have the seasoning and experience they lacked so much
last year and should be about due,” comments Miller. “Last
year we ran up against so many tough teams that no matter
how much we talked to the boys they knew how the score
stood and you can’t win ball games if you don’t think you
have a chance.”

The Millermen of last season could never be labeled as
loafers, however, and that same old password “hustle” will
be Coach Miller's theme again this year. Throw this in with
a little experience and basketball know-how and a more
Davidson-level schedule and who knows—anything can
happen.
