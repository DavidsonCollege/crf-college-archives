(Christian Hospital: Post

In Midst Of Buddhism

By LEE KIRBY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Operating room equipment from Germany, financed by an American college,
used by a missionary doctor, supervised by a non-denominational Christian church
in a Buddhist nation: this is the great amalgum of tradition and progress that is
Thailand and the Bangkok Christian Hospital.

The Hospital had its begin-
ning in 1949 with Presbyterian
missionaries in Thailand’s capi-
tal city. After many years of
service, it was formally turned
over to the new Church of
Christ in Thailand. Dr. Marshall
Welles, a Presbyterian Medical
Missionary continues as direc-
tor.

A new clinic was built in
1957 which greatly increased

;the capacity of the hospital.

The Davidson Student Body has
voted to direct its 1959 Gift
Fund to the purchase of an
operating table and lamp to fur-
nish a new surgery room.

NEAR TEMPLE

The hospital is located equi-
distant from a Buddhist Tem-
ple and the United. States In-
formation Service, pointing up
the contrasts of Thailand’s
largest city of one million. In
the center of the city is the
sprawling Grand Palace which
houses the famous Emerald
Buddha and the Thai monarchy.

The government has been a
constitutional monarchy since a
bloodless coup d ‘etet in 1932.
The present King educated in
Switzerland, nominally shares
administration with a Premier
and a cabinet of 27 ministers.

son as the guests of Dr. and
Mrs, Harding Kneedler, former
missionaries to Thailand.

“I am not only moderator but
pastor to thirty-four churches,”
Rev. Pantupong commented.
“Much of the church leader-
ship must come from the laity,
since’ we do not have nearly
enough ministers in our coun-
try.”

Commenting on his pre-
dominantly Buddhist homeland,
he said: “The Buddhists are
friendly and are good neigh-
bors. They do not openly op-
pose Christianity but they are
displeased when their children
become Christians. Each child
is expected to follow the foot-
steps of his forefathers out of
respect.”

“Both the Buddhists and
Christians are opposed to Com-
munism because it is anti-religi-
ous,” Pantupong commented.
The four Islamic provinces are
also anti-Communist.

’ NATIONAL PROBLEMS

Another big problem is il-
literacy. There is only one in-
stitution of higher learning in
the nation which is incapable

1200 girls. There are two large
mission schools in Bangkok.

As in all Eastern nations,
disease and poverty are major
concerns. Leprosy is widely
spread and there are many
leper villages. Mission hospitals
such as Bangkok Christian Hos-
pital can be found throughout
the nation.

KING OF SIAM

Mrs. Kneedler’s great-grand-
father, Dr. Dan Bradley, was
the first medical missionary to
Bangkok in 1835. He was per-
sonal physician and personal
friend to the King made famous
in The King and 1, Rodgers and
Hammerstein musical. In addi-
tion he was responsible for in-
troducing modern medical prac-
tices such as smallpox vaccina-
tion into Siam.

The Kneedlers have followed
their ancestor’s example by
serving as medica] missionaries
to Chiangmai, Thailand's sec-

_ond largest city, from 1930 to

1941 and for two years after
the Second World War.

“The Thai are a free and hap-
py people,” Mrs. Kneedler com-
mented. “They have accepted

of handling all the qualified ap- Americans because we came to
plicants. There is a system of them with medicine and educa-

state schools to combat the 60%
illiteracy rate.

The church schools are among
the best. Mrs. Pantupong is the
