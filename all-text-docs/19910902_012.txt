Freshmen Codes were to be inves-
tigated and dealt with by this Court
of upperclassmen:

As Davidson College devel-

oped, so did the Freshmen regula--

tions. Some issues of the hand-
book require freshmen to carry
matches for the upperclassmen or
the freshmen not to enter the post
office until 8:35am [so the upper-
class could get their mail first].
However, the following rules were
consistently found throughout the
student handbooks:

--Freshmen shall show respect
to upperclassmen at all times.

--Freshmen mustknow college
yells and songs by the seventh day
after school opens.

--Freshmen must wear at all
times, the caps prescribed for them

by the Court of Control [Hester
Prynne hada scarlet ‘A’, freshmen
had their beanies].

--Freshmen shall not walk on
the grass of Davidson campus.

--Freshmen shall remain in
chapel seats until all upperclass-
men have cleared the room [appli-
cable when chapel was manda-
tory].

--Each Freshman shall have
his own placard with his name
inserted in the proper place, hang-
ing in a conspicuous place in his
room throughout the year.

--Freshmen are required to
attend all pep meetings and be on
time.

--Freshmen are required to
attend all major athletic events
fifteen minutes early, sit together,
and remain through the entire
contest.

--Freshmen are required to

wear YMCA nameplates until Oct
15.

--Freshmen must carry to all
athletic contests and pep meetings
the megaphones prescribed for
them by the Court of Control.

--Freshmen are required to
speak to all men they meet on
campus and tip their hats to the
members of the faculty.

book of 1939-40)

If the freshmen were able to
beat the sophomore class in the
Upperclass/Freshmen football
game held in October, these codes
ceased with the final seconds of
the match. However, if they lost,
the beanies were seen until the end
of the year. When they had won
their freedom through sport or
endurance, the freshmen celebrated
with huge beanie burning parties
and eagerly awaited the next fresh-

man class to enter Davidson.

“Excuse me. Do y’all have to
still eat at the Commons the first
semester?”

“The Commons?
that?”

“Or did you play the name
game or get suckered into your
first Davidson kiss?”

“T’m sorry, sir, but my private
life is none. . .”

“The regatta. You must do the
FreshmenRregatta.”

“The reg-what? Oh yeah. That
regotcha thing. Everything less
than ten dollars, build a raft, and
race a couple yards. You know,
they forced you to do some weird
stuff.”
