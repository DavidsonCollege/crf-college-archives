SC Tournament

Well, it’s tournament time again for Davidson

and the Southern Conference. You can almost hear all”

the longtime Davidson basketball followers saying,
“Here we go again. We'll probably blow it in the first
game this year.” It appears they fear the annual tour-
nament like the people of the medieval ages feared
the black plague. Then again,'the two are similar in
certain ways. They are a battle for life, or so it seems.

For three days or fewer, depending upon how long
the teams win without losing, eight SC teams play the
hardest and best basketball they can. They eliminate
each other with no quarter given or asked for. It's
kind of like a demolition derby you might see on tele-
vision’s “Wide World of Sports” with the last car
moving being the winner.

In the past, except for one time, the 1965-66 sea-
son, Davidson has been one of the seven teams that ran
out of gas, so to speak. The renowned teams that the
Hetzel crew played on never won the title. The bad
guys were VMI in '63-’64. and West Virginia in ’64-’65.
Last year we played for and won second place as was
evident by the bad beating we received in the tourna-
ment final. This year should be different.

“You guys win the next eight games and you'll be
national champs.” Lefty told us this before Monday's
“volunteer” (those who thought they needed to work
out were supposed to) practice. Signs all around our
locker room echoed the same thing: “The team that
Hustles, For Just Three Days, Wins A Chance At The
National Crown,” and, “Now Try This One: The NCAA
Championship!” are examples of the lyrics which stare
at us as we dress for practice. ‘It will take desire, con-
centration, guts, and poise to win,” Lefty left us with
these words on Monday.

We were greeted before practice on Tuesday in
the locker room with the unmistakable sounds of the
song “Sweet Thing.” Lefty had a record player put in
the dressing room which was playing certain choice
songs. “Sweet Thing,” if nothing else, got us dressed
in a hurry and up on the floor. Once on the court we
heard the stirring words of the song, “Step to the
Rear.” The starters began practicing fererishly to
drown out the sound with bouncing basketballs while
the skins started looking for a line to stand in. Serious-
ly, after this “music” was turned off, everyone prac-
ticed in earnest and everything became business.

On Wednesday we worked out in the Charlotte
Coliseum and then on Thursday the “fun” started.
Seeded first, due to our regular season record, we
faced William & Mary in our first game at 7:00. You
know, William & Mary, the team picked to finish third
and ended up eighth. Still, they have the conference’s
leading scorer Bob Sherwood.

It’s quite humorous reading newspaper accounts
of interviews with various SC coaches whose teams are
in the tournament. VMI’s coach Gary McPherson said
little of his team’s chance to win the tournament and
Bucky Waters said the Mountaineers will need a
“super-human” effort to win. Everyone is‘trying to play
the roll of David who surprised Goliath. It’s funny
seeing all the “underdogs” running around looking for
a “favorite” to surprise and never finding one, be-
cause everyone is acting like they're “underdogs.”

As for Davidson and the tournament, we have
something to prove, more to ourselves, than anyone
else. That is, that we are better than some of the teams
that beat us earlier in the season. We remember vivid-
ly the West Virginia fiasco, the Duke defeat, and the
Vanderbilt let-downs. The only way we get a chance
at the National Tournament,is to win the SC tourna-
ment.

Also on the material side, if we win the tourna-
ment this year besides receiving a trophy, we get a
watch. We eould add this to our Charlotte Invitational
and Sugar Bowl Classic watches and start a collection.
But to close in a serious note, unless one of the numer-
ous “underdogs” finds us and surprises us, we should
be playing St. Johns, March 9, in the University of
Maryland's Cole Field House for the chance to go to
the Eastern Regionals. I always wondered what the
benches looked like in the big time. Maybe they're
softer, but I doubt it.

Cagers Hold Off Tulane
In Sluggish Final Game

By DAVID BRANCH
Sports Writer

Tulane’s Green Wave fell
to Davidson 7668 Saturday
night at the Charlotte Coli-
seum, as the ‘Cats closed out
their regular season basket-
ball schedule. The win left
the Wildcats with a 19-4 sea-
son mark.

The ‘Cats played somewhat
uninspired basketball for
most of the first half but
came on strong with five
minutes left in the first peri-
od, extending their lead to 19
points early in the second
half. Then they coasted home
for the last five minutes for
the win.

“Tulane has a good ball
elub,” Coach C. G. (Lefty)
Driesell commented.

“They hustie and shoot
veal well.” U thought we
played well once we got the
lead, although t wouldn’t
say we were especially in-
spired.”

The ‘Cats seemed to have
trouble with Tulane’s 2-3 zone
defense in the first half. In
the zone the Green Wave was
able to block Davidson's
passing lanes fairly effective.
ly during the first period. Af-
ter half-time adjustments, the
Wildcats’ offensive machine
functioned more smoothly.

Frosh Close Out Hot Year
With Kings College Rout

By DOUG HAYNES
Sports Writer

Davidson's freshman bas-
ketball season came to a
close last Saturday with a
110-83 romp over King’s Col-
lege. This win gave the Wild-
kittens a 12-3 record, second
only in Davidson history to
last year’s 15-0.

To freshman head coach
Jerry Conboy, this year’s
successful season came as
@ big and plessant sur-
prise “This team did be-
yond my fondest hopes. We
played some real tough
competion, but we worked
hard and made a lot of
progress,” he said.
Conboy thought that the

Duke games, the two Rich-
mond games, and the Wake
Forest games were the ‘Kit-
tens’ toughest competition.

He also considered, without

FABULOUS DINING

hesitation, that the first Duke
game was the highlight of
the season.

In that game, the Kittens
overcame a 23 point Blue
Imp lead to win 105-104 in the
closing seconds. Overall, the
freshmen played six Atlantic
Coast Conference games and
finished 3-3 with this tougher
competition.

Giving credit to specific

players for this year’s suc- |

cess, Conboy named seven
boys : Steve Kirley, Ricky
Snipes, Duncan Postma, Bil-
ly Pierce, Ron Stelzer, Gene
Early and Mark Affeldt. ‘Of
course, we couldn't have done
it without Kirley or Snipes,
but the same thing can be
said for the other boys.”
Kirley was the big man for
the ‘Kittens, averaging 24.9
points a game and 12.6 re-
bounds. Snipes was second

with a 16.9 point average.
Conboy felt that several of

the boys have a lot to con-

tribute to the varsity team.

Conboy is quite optimistic
in pointing out several pros-
pects for next year's team.
He pointed out that as the
high school seasons were end-
ing. more and more pros-

-pects will be coming on cam-

pus to look at Davidson.

Commenting on Davidson's
outlook for the tournament,
Driesell added: ‘We're not

playing them one at a time.
But I do feel we should be
