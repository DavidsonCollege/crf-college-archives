Brick Carelessly Thrown

Inflicts Serious Injury

Thos. E. Lothery of Davidson Stu-
dent Body May Recover Sight
After Serious Injury

|
Thomas E. Lothery, of the Freshman

class, was hit in the right eye with a
brick on Monday, November 17th. He
| was taken to a hospital in Charlotte, but
‘is now at home. It is thought that use-
ful sight will be regained.

Lothery was putting his car -in the
garage, when a friend playfully threw
a piece of brick at the building in an
effort to frighten him. “The brick missed
the garage and struck Lothery corner-
wise in the eye just as he came through
the doorway. The right eye
seriously injured.

Tt was doubtful at the time of the ac-
cident whether sight would be retained,
but Dr. MacConnell expressed himself as
being reasonably hopeful that Lothery
will regain at least useful control of the
injured organ,

Freshman Lothery is a son of T. E.
Lothéry, of the M. H. Goodrum Company
firm, and is well-known about town as
well as in the college. He was a mem-
ber of last year’s graduating class at the
local high school, Since his return from
Charlotte on November 23, he has been
under the care of Dr. J. M. MacConnell.
It is hoped that complete recovery will
soon permit Lothery to return to his col-

the opening of the fourth quarter, Furman |
started down the field and aftér a 25-yard
gain, a lateral pass, Pipkins to Rawle, netted
16 yards and a touchdown. As the game was
‘nearing a close, Pipkins intercepted a pass
and went 25 yards. An attempted field goal
failed. Davidson kicked and when Furman
fumbled, recovered the ball in midfield, Then

| BISHOP RONDTHALER
(Continued from page 1) |

Speaking of the materialistic feeling which |
for a time made rapid progress and caused
|fear to arise, Bishop Rondthaler said, “But |
‘now the road has turned. Now we can |
triumphantly return, with confidence backed
up by scientific research, to the old beliefs
that there is mind, and that there is soul.
| Straight shooting is needed to show that
| mind really mind—and soul is soul. !
| Straight and vigorous thinking must be)
done.” |

The speaker made reference to the beliefs |
adopted by those who still hold to the
| Wundt mechanistic theory. Statements from
the pens of prominent psychologists who
hold the Wundt theory were read. |

In concluding his address, the Bishop cited
great and harmful results that would follow
should the Wundt theory be accepted. One
result, for example, would be the breaking |
up of many homes. No hope of change
‘could be held out to one into whose life
there had come a defect, if it was only
“gray matter’? that was responsible,

The processes of law would be broken
down, Murderers could not be responsible
for their acts—they would not be morally
responsible. Criminals could lay the blame

is

q} for their crimes on defective gray matter,

and the laws would be helpless.

Then there would follow the denial of
the soul as an entity. There would be no
moral responsibility—no hope for the out-
There would be
no salvation—no hope, because of the “gray
matter.”

The convincing example of a man whose
life was changed from that of a habitual ,
drunkard to that of a respectable Christian |
gentleman, a man who later became a leader
“What can the
mechinists say to such cases?”

“Stand fast in the liberty by which Christ
has set you free.- Put the same value on
mind and soul as Jesus put. ‘What shall it
profit a man if he gain the whole world and

!cast——no grace to sinners.

Hayden Hollingsworth presided, reading
the scripture from the sixth chapter of
Ephesians. S. F. Bryant led the singing,
Wallace Purdy was pianist, and McCravy
and Count Davis rendered a cornet duet.
