The

College Completes
Fiscal Year With
$800 Surplus

By ALEC HOON
Managing Editor

Davidson College finished the
1971-72 fiscal year in the black,
with income exceeding ex-
penditure by $758.53, according
to College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr.

Vice President for Finance
and Development C. David Cor-
nell stated that such a surplus
was maintained despite earlier
predictions of a possible deficit
from $80,000 to $100,000, due to
the efforts of several groups.

“IT would like to compliment
the faculty and all those in-
volved with annual giving for
their efforts in making the 1971-
72 budget effort a success.

“If the faculty had not made
cutbacks in their department
spending, and if the Annual
Fund people had not done such
a good job, we might well have
ended with an _ operating
deficit,’ Cornell said.

The 1971-72 annual fund drive
netted an all-time high of
$275,350, an increase of 45 per
cent over the previous year’s
collection.

In addition, the Wildcat
Club for athletics collected
$129,872 to make the total an-
nual giving sum $405,422 as
compared to $286,430 in 1970-71.

The budget for the 1972-73
fiscal year, running from July
1, 1972 to June 30, 1973, was an-
nounced earlier this summer by
Cornell.

The 1972-73 operating budget
has been increased by only 2.85
per cent to $5,894,614. Actual
reductions were made in the
areas of operation and main-
tenance of the physical plant,
general administration, and
modest cuts in athletics and
plysical education, and student
services.

However, at the same time,
certain other priorities were
met, including the bolstering
and improving of the college
security force, a modest in-

crease in the library’s
operating budget, obtaining
more student counseling and in-
creasing staff benefits, and an
additional seven percent for
student aid.

Spencer praised the budget
effort saying,‘ Davidson is very
fortunate to have broken even
when financial problems con-
tinue for all independent
colleges.

“It is hard to overemphasize
the importance of the Duke En-
dowment’s support over the
years. Another important fac-
tor was the recent
reorganization of development
and finance functions under the
office of Vice-President Cornell
which permitted simultaneous
control over both expenditures
and fund raising,’’ Spencer
said.

WORKING FOR A MORE SECURE DAVIDSON
Terry Springs will be one of two policemen patroling the campus this year.

New Security Implemented

By BOB HOWELL
Asst. Managing Editor

Additional police patrols and
extra lighting facilities should
provide a substantial im-
provement in campus security
this year, according to Director
of Physical Plant Grover C.
Meetze.

In a contractual agreement
with the town, the college is
paying half the part-time
salaries of Davidson's four
policemen, thereby securing
two men and a patrol car to
cover the campus, Meetze said.

‘“‘One man is on duty from 6
p.m. to 2 a.m., and the other
works from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.,”’
he explained, ‘‘so there will be
extra protection during the
worst hours.”

In addition, one of the three
campus security officers em-
ployed last year will remain to
patrol the grounds from 2 p.m.

Spencer to Speak

By BRUCE MALOY
Asst Managing Editor
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. will deliver his an-
nual overview or ‘‘state of the

...annual overview

college’ address on Monday,
Sept 25.

The speech will be delivered
outdoors on Patterson Court
after supper. Present plans
call for dessert to be served.

“I want to let the students
know where we stand in areas
such as the new library, funding
programs, new housing
proposals, security, changes in
the educational program and
the new social system.

‘New housing is of particular
interest due to the expansion of
the student body. We have
several plans which will be con-
sidered before recommenda-
tions are made to the trustees.”

Spencer characterized the
speech as an informal report to
students.

“Since we no longer get
together as a community at
chapel, we have to make the op-
portunity to meet."

to 10 p.m.

‘We've been able to provide
increased coverage with no in-
crease in cost,’’ Meetze noted.

He added that patrolmen will
be unable to enter any dor-
mitory unless summoned by a
student.

“The system should be more
efficient than it’s been,” he
said. “‘The man on foot with a
walkie-talkie will be in contact
with the patrolman in the car
and the town and county police.
The new security emergency
telephone number, 892-5131, is
the number of the Davidson
Police Department.”

To supplement improved
police protection, the college
has installed new light fixtures
and increased lighting around
Grey House, the dormitories
and in front of Chambers
Building.

‘‘We've set up only temporary
poles so far,’’ Meetze explained,
‘because we're experimenting
with different standards and
are anxious that the total
system be compatible."

He noted the entire system
was approved by the SGA
Senate last April, and em-
phasized that the Senate’s Cam-
pus Security Committee will
continue working to improve it,
soliciting as much student and
faculty opinion as possible.

‘Light standards are so ex-
pensive we want to make sure
we pick the right one, satisfac-
tory to everybody,’ he pointed
out, adding that any complaints
or suggestions about the new
security system should be
brought to him or the Campus
Security Committee.

It is expected that students,
through the Senate, will
aid in policing the campus,
eventually assuming com-
pletely the responsibility of
regulating student parking,
Meetze said.

“Security will be much more
available when needed,’ said
Dean of Students Will H. Terry,
“although there will be some

rough edges to straighten out. The need for student par-

“It’s notable that the Senate

continue to be involved in per-

“‘We don’t know whether the
security system will work,”
Terry concluded, ‘‘but we
believe it can, and it's certainly
worth a try.”’
