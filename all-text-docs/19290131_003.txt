THE WANDERING
JEW

Judging from a recent copy of the
TECHNICIAN, it seems that the state
boys are having more trouble in getting
their band properly clothed than David-
son has. It seems that a student body
meeting was called to decide whether the
student body would be assessed the ice
of one dollar per man next. year and to
raise about fifteen hundred dollars. On-
ly fifty boys turned out to meeting and so
they were unable to even begn in. raising
the fund.

We wonder if the JOHNSONIAN is
considering buying out the NEW YORK
TIMES, judging from the fact that they
show a marked preference for the news
which the TIMES sanctioned
“fit to print.” It will be simply great to
have our neighbors at Winthrop running
such a powerful organ as the New York
Times. But perhaps we are wrong, and
they don’t usually use more than ten
of the TIMES’ articles per issue.

If the proposed plans go through, the
University of North Carolina’s TAR
HEEL is to become a daily paper, rather
than being published tri-weekly (not, try-
weakly). Congratulations may not yet be
in order but we wish to add whatever en-
couragement we may in the undertaking.
Ii the move goes through, The TAR
HEEL will certainly be the only daily
in this section of the country. “Contrary
to the beliefs of some students, though,
there are two dailies published by sovth-
ern universities, both in Texas, the pit-
pers of the University of Texas, and of
Baylor.

No doubt the freshmen at Davidson
would welcome a headline like the follow-
ing. Freshmen Not Required to Wear
Caps. Such is the recent ruling issue by
the Dean of Men, of High Point Col-
lege, as reported by THE HI-PO, Sey-
eral reasons were advanced ia defense
of the position. Chief among these was
the statement that the caps had become
badly worn and frayed, and that it was
not proper to make thc freshmen buy
new caps for the remainder of the year.

The freshmen up at Elon are taking
things in their own hands. Qre of their
recent contributions is in the form of an
issue of the MAROON AND GOLD.
Although indulging in the usual  self-
laudatory style, they did put a good issue

From the South Carolina GAME-
COCK comes the news that the U. S. C.
men’s Glee Club has resigned from the
Southern Assocaton of Glee Clubs. The
reason gven was that they felt that they
had been treated unfairly in a recent con-
test with Wofford. The judges were se-
lected by Wofford, and the decision was
given to Wofford. Such things may lead

to an inference, that Wofford “cheat-
ed,” But, in spite of that, it appears to
be pretty bad taste and questionable

ethics to give much prominence to such
an affair on the front page.
