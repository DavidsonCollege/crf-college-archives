North Carolina State College freshmen
defeated Davidson freshmen here
Friday afternoon 20 to 6. The game was
featured by the work of the entire State
team, and the work of Davidson’s two
ends, McConnell and Myers, and Holm-
green, in the line, and Black and Win-
burg in the backfield.

The game started with State receiving
the goal. They returned the
kick-off to the 40 yard line, and it was
a steady march down the field to their
first touch down, Melton carrying the

for 30 yards; another to Meyers went

kick goal.

H
| It is nearing time for the papers and}
| the coaches to pick the mythical all- |
state eleven, and if one Jim Hendrix does ,
{not occupy a berth on that team then
there will be something wrong in Den-

mark.

That is not soMuuch personal opinion,
}
as the opinion of people all over North

Carolina, for his dazzling performance

against Carolina, Saturday, has caused
the headlines to carry his name as the
outstanding and brilliant star of the
game.

Grey's name was mentioned along with
his many times, but we don't expect Dick
to come across with that honor this year.

' However, he has it coming to him some
lRiny, and that day may be next year.
His return of the punts against Carolina,
Saturday, were remarkable.

Sports scribes will give considaration
to Vance and Baker, for both of these
men have been gr eat forces in the Wild-
cat line, which is altogether good, with
every man deserving of good mention. |

What is so remarkable, and what peo-
ple sometimes lose sight of, is the fact
that Davidson is a little school of about
625 students, with a team that Averages |
Hess than 160 pounds, meeting teams al

from student
in
jinstance over 2,000 students, and whose |

are gathered together

bodys of over a stousand and one

|
average weight is somewhere in- the
nature of between 10 to 20 pounds
heavier. Yet the little Wildcat team |

| beats these larger representative teams, |
lor plays them to standstills, or outplays |
them, though defeated. It is remerkable, ;
and while championship honors may be |
meted out to some other team, upon a
lcomparative basis Davidson could again
{claim first honors.

And they are, too. Such an expression
“the Wildcats looked far better in |
| defeat than the Tar Heels in victory,” |
| thrills every Davidson student. Rihay
read the other comments of fthe papers
over North Carolina, and, every publi- |
cation that had a witness there cannot |

|

as

give too much honor to the Wildcats.

Coach Monk made a statement to the |
team which he has never made to them |
before, and it shows what from his stand-
point the game really was, for he told |
the team at Monday's practice that they |
should have won the game. And when
told the statistics, about how much more||
ground the Wildcats had gained, then it |
was that he laughed and said, “To think
j what the score was with all of that!”

{

|
| Then, when Davidson comes out on the
low end of a score and gains Io! yards
more from the team that won by two
touchdowns, it shows that the Wildcats
should get a great deal of consideration
for that marvelous feat, even though
defeated.

Charley's gay coat made quite a hit at
the Carolina game. Charley has every
slicker in school beat a mile. He explain-
ed that he had the horseshoe painted on
his coat so that he would not lose it.
