The victory over Pres-

last Saturday was the

fourth straight win for the Wildcats and |

makes the series néw stand at Davidson 6 and
P. C. 2, one game being a tie.

If the Wildcats can keep up the excellent
defense work that was displayed in the P. C.
contest, they shotild give an unusually good
account of themselves this season. The Da-
vidson backfield has been considered strong
since the opening of school, but the ability
of the line to hold in crucial moments had
not really been tested until Saturday,

Lincoln played a bang-up game at tackle.
Handicapped by a broken nose. big “Abe”
often tore the P. C. first defense to pieces,
He was probably even stronger on the de-
fensive, nailing a Presbyterian runner many
times before his interference could form.
MeColgan, starting his first varsity game,
gave a good account of himself. at guard,
While not playing a spectacular game, he was
fighting hard on every play and stopped many
a P. C. plunge.

Jack Stamps, the Blue Hose quarter, is
the best triple threat man Davidson has play-
ed against this season, He outkicked Grey
by several yards, carried the burden of the
P. C. attack via the air route and gained
more yardage in proportion to the times he
ran than any other player on the field. His
defensive work was also of high order.

Hogrefe, fleet half of the Clinton team, i
credited with the longest run of the day, a
return of a punt for 30 yards. Stamps got
the longest run ‘from scrimmage, 13 yards.
He also made the longest punt, 70 yards:
The Presbyterian captain, Griffith, fought
hard all the way through the contest, and
many times gave the Davidson offensive a
rude‘ jolt.

The present Junior class won the series last |
year, not losing a single’: game. The coach
has about 15 men to chose from, several of |
whom played on the championship team of |
last autumn.

Presbyterian College Bows to Davidson in

Guilford Quakers
to Play Wildcats

The Guilford Quakers, who come to Da-
vidson Saturday for a game with the Wild-
cats, will bring a team composed of big. men.
The Guilford team is said to be in fine con-
dition due to a rest which has extended two
weeks.
urday a week ago, when they went down in
defeat before Duke University. Due to the
forward passing of the Duke team, this de-
feat was to the tune of 32 to 0.

The ‘Quakers held the Bl&e Devils to a
scoreless tie in the first quarter, but were
weak in breaking up the passes of the Duke
team. The outstanding player on the Guil-
ford team is Beatty, their quarterback. In
the Duke game he was the star for the Guil-
ford team, playing a hard game and backing
up his line in fine style. The Guilford ends,
Parish and Kimrey, are the outstanding lines-
men on the team, having the knack of cover-
ing punts in a style similar to that of the
Davidson ends.

The last game they played was Sat- !

The Wildeats are in good shape after the
hard game with P. C. While several men on
the squad are bruised and sore, there are no
serious injuries. Captain Wells and “Sook”
Boggs will be eligible to play, after missing
the last two games.

The game last year resulted in a 26 to 0
victory for Davidson, Coach Younger start-
ed his second team which gained at will
against the Quakers and scored all the points.
The first team was unable to do anything
against the fighting Guilford team and the
“All Americans” were called into service
and finished the game. While Coach Young-
er has not announced any plan, it is thought

| that the entire squad will see action with the

Class basketball has gotten under way at
last. The four teams have been practicing |
for a week and are fast rounding into shape. |
As has been the custom in the past varsity |

men; Ben Wilson, lanky: center of last year, |

Simpson is the coach of the Juniors. The
Coach of the Seniors has not been selected
yet.

The strength of Guilford, Davidson's op-
ponent for this Saturday, is not expected to
make the Wildcats display any plays they
may be hiding from scouts. Last year the
second team played most of the game with
the Quakers. When Coach Younger gave
the varsity a chance to limber up they could
not pierce the Guilford defense and were
jerked from the game.

Baptists of two states will clash this Sat-
urday when Furman and Wake Forest meet.
The strength of these two teams was fully
demonstrated last week when Furman smash-
ed her way to an overwhelming victory over
N. C. State and the Deacons ran up a top-
heavy score against Wofford. :

Quarter of Game

Stamps, Griffith, Kirven, Lincoln,
Leggette and Grey Play Stellar
Ball Throughout

The Davidson Wildcats were dgain vic-
torious over the Blue Stockings of Presby-

terian College last Saturday in Rock Hill. |

The win of the Davidson team was the
fourth straight victory over the South Caro-
lina team, and the second win in four years
by the same score, 3 to.0. Early in the sec-
ond quarter Dick Grey the oval
through P. C.’s goal posts for the margin of
victory.

booted

Adding color to the colorful occasion were
1,800 Winthrop College gitls, on whose ath-
letic field the contest was staged. The sup-
port of the girls was about evenly divided
throughout the game, and both colleges had.
a goodly number of students and alumni on
hand to cheer the team of their chocie.

The game was one of the hardest fought
The
first quarter saw Davidson with a distinct
advantage over the Presbyterians, and the
Red and Black had the ball deep in the op-
ponent’s territory many times. Under the
able direction of Ed Wilson,the Davidson
team, through several beautiful dashes by
Grey and. Leggette, carried the ball to the
45-yard line. Wilson caught P. C. off guard
when he called for a kick, Grey sending the
pigskin to the one-yard marker. Stamps
soon ‘punted out of bounds to the 40-yard
line. Davidson made two first downs, car-
rying the ball to the nine-yard line, and
Grey dropped back and sent the oval through
the posts for the only score of the game.

Several other times during the first half
did Davidson threaten, but the P. C. defense
tightened and Stamps kicked out of danger.
About the middle of the first quarter, Da-
vidson took Stamps’ punt on the 40-yard line
and in two first downs carried the ball within
10 yards of the goal. Three line plays failed,
and a pass, Wilson to Grey, netted nine
yards, but the ball went over to P. C.

Stamps, Blue Hose quarter, played a stel-
lar game for the South Carolinians. He ran
his team excellently;-and the few occasions
that he himself carried the ball gained con-
sistently. His passes were quick, fast and
deadly, several more would have been com-
pleted had it not been for the superb work
of the Dayidson backfield in breaking them
up.

For the major portion of the time he was

|in the game, Leggette bore the brunt of the

Davidson attack. The hard-driving Wildcat
back often tore gapping holes in the Presby-
terian line for.good gains. The work of Lin-
coln, in the Davidson line, deserves mention.
On several occasions the lanky tackle would
smash P. C. plays before they could get un-
| der way and was a terror in getting down
under punts.

The class basketball series, which is the
leading interclass athletic activity of the

| college, opens this week with unusual rivalry.

| Every team bids fair to give hard battles and

to fight for first place.

horses of the race, and not much can be told
about the material they will have

| men usually allow their faint hearts to keep

Under the direction of Coach
Tom Anderson they should turn out a good
team.

winning the series for the past two years as
they have the advantage of having played

The Seniors had a good team last year
and most of them are still eligible and should

Vaughn and Womack are showing form in

|Wrestling Team to
~ Commence Practice

The prospects for a good wrestling team
this year are not entirely bright in spite of
| the fact that there are five letter men back,
| namely : Frierson, Davis, Estridge, Crinkley
and Mauldin. There are few trained men
in the heavy-weights and Mauldin, most
promising heavy-weight, may be out because
of a bad shoulder and torn ligament. He is
able to play football but this will handicap
| him in wrestling. The services of such men
| will be hard to develop men to fill their
| places.

Captain Weems, who distinguished himself
in wrestling at the U. S. Military Academy,
and coach of the Davidson squad for three
years, will have charge this year. He will
endeavor to develop such men as Flythe,
King, Harold, Bailey, Harrel, Regen, Cro-
martie.

Professor Wood has authorized the expen-
diture of $225 toward the reconstruction of
The
old mats are being repaired by the Lawing
Mattress Factory, of Charlotte, and’ should
be ready by the middle of the month. This
equipment with the splendid new mats and
covers and the spacious wrestling room now
available will giye Davidson best wrestling
facilities in the state.

For the first time in the history of wrest-
ling at Davidson there will be a Freshman
Several meets are pending
and there is a possibility of awarding mono-
grams to those who make the team. Fresh-

{men will also be eligible for the West Point

meet.

The schedule is thé stiffest on record and is
as follows:

Concord “Y"”—Pending.

State at Davidson—January 15.

Army at West Point—February 5.

Duke at Davidson—February 12.

V. P. I. at Davidson—February 19.

U. N. C. at Davidson—Date pending.

Another game of interest in the Carolinas
is the game between the Universities of the
two states. South Carolina upset the dope
and beat Maryland 12 to 0 Saturday and are
generally favored to down the Tar Heels,
who have found Wake Forest and Tennessee

rough going in the last two weeks.
