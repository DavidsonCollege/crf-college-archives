EPC PROPOSAL

The Educational Policy Committee recommends é
that the Faculty modify the present regulation which %
states that a student may drop a course through the #%
end of the first academic week of each term to the %

waive its requirement that
information on proposals be
circulated to the faculty
five days before any action
could be taken by a meet-
ing, but the faculty felt the
matter was too important
and docked the proposal un-
tif a later meeting, occord-
ing to Earl W. Lawrimore,

%

A student may, with the approval of the Registrar,
DROP a course at any scheduled time prior to 5:00
p.m._of the twenty-fifth scheduled class day of any
term, i.e., through the end of the fifth week of any
ten-week term, regardiess of the num

meeting days established by the’ professor—of the

topic of ‘‘The Supreme

Court in a Turbulent World.”

He is regarded as an
authority in the -study of
the American Constitution
and_ the. judicial. system.

Among his books are ‘‘The
Judicial Power of the Unit-
ed States” and ‘The Quest
for Equality: The Constitu-
tion, Congress and the Su-
preme Court.”

Bevan said the Education-
al Policy Committee, from
which the proposal had
come, felt that it would
place no hardship on the
professor to allow a student
to leave a course, since he
would then have only to
teach one student fewer.

However, a similar pro-
posal_to—extend-the ‘‘add”’
period for courses to the
same length was rejected
by the EPC because a pro.
fessor could not be expect-
ed to bring a student who
had missed five weeks of
classes up to date, accord-
ing to Bevan.

The proposal was also ex-
pected to. help students who
might want to change ma-
jors, since they would then
be able to drop a_ course
which they might be taking
for completion of a major
they no longer wanted to
pursue without penalty.

The present penalty for
dropping a course after
more than five days is a
penalty grade of F.
'-Lawrimore also  suggest-
éd that there was a possibili-
ty of extending the period
for registration for the pass-
fail option to five weeks, but
that._this. has..not_yet been
fully considered by the EPC.

Other happenings at the
faculty meeting included an
appeal. by senior Gene
Early, chairman of the
Honor Court, to have the
members of the faculty clari-
fy to their classes precisely
what they expected under
the H from their
students.

Seven of the twelve fra-
ternities are involved in
this first unofficial rush
session, including Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Sigma’ Phi
Epsilon, Phi Delta. Theta,
Kappa Alpha, Sigma Nu,
Kappa Sigma, and Alpha
Tau Omega. The open house
was scheduled for last night
from 9 until fi.

Lyman /Parrigin, ‘who
headed the meeting, discus-
sed publicity for the pro-
gram before the first party
to inform freshmen of the
purpose of rush. . Posters
_were to be placed in all
freshmen halls advertising
the party.

Parrigin said, ‘I think
that there might be some re-
luctance among freshmen to
come down, since it is. not
official."’

fie also mentioned the
possibility of working with
hall counselors in the future

to axpiedn the program to
freshmen more effectively
rather than sending frater-
nity men into the dorms to
encourage participation,

“If you are a hall counse-
lor you don't want freshmen
up until 3:00 in the morning
just because IFC rules are
suspended. We don’t want to
use hall counselors to legi-
timize this thing, but I. think
we have to go beyond mere
advertising.’’

Since the  Interfraternity
Council will soon disband it-
self, Parringin stated that
any rules for the open house
would be based on ‘good
faith,’ The fraternities in-
volved will meet again Mon-
day to evaluate the success
of the rush program.

Another similar open house
will be held on November
18, senior Jim Cantrell had
previously announced.
