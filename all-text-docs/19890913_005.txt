In what will surely be the easiest test of your intellect this term, Apple invites you
to try winning a free Apple® Macintosh’ Plus personal computer merely by finding it in
this drawing. |

We'll even give you a hint: It's not the table, the lamp, or the chair.

Now you're on your own.

To register, look for contest details where Macintosh computers are sold on, your.
campus. Oh, all right, we'll give you a hint for that, too: Look at the bottom of this ad.

But do it really, really fast. Because only one Macintosh is being given away on
this campus, and it’s going to happen soon.

Soon, as in right away. Pronto. Quick-like.

But hey, you can take a hint.
