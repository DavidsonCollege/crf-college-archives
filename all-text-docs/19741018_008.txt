Booters Excel In Win
Over South Carolina

By FRANK STIEFEL
Staff Writer

Davidson’s soccer team,
after a couple of dissapointing
ties and losses, seems to have

righted themselves again.
Last Friday, the Cats
travelled to Boone for a game
against Appalachian. The
game was not much of an of-
fensive display, and the result
was a 0-0 tie. This left the
booters with an 0-1-2 record

for their last-three games.
However, the team’s trip to
Columbia for a Monday game
against South Carolina
proved to be a change in their

fortunes.

The Cats controlled the
game from the outset. With
about 10 minutes to go in the
first half, sophomore Bob Gid-
uz scored, with the assist

having to put up wooden
posts.”’

Polley also visited various
Egyptian ministries. such as
the agricultural, social af-
fairs, and cultural ministries.
He also had a tour of the In-
formation Bureau from which
all the news in Egypt is
disseminated.

Three ministry officials
worked with the Consortium
throughout the group’s stay
there. Consequently, Polley’s
group had the opportunity to
meet with various ‘“higher-
up”’ officials.

As part of his religious
research Polley met with the
Muslim Grand Sheik of
Alazahar and the Pope of the
Coptic religion Shenuda III.
He also saw mosques and
other relgious temples.

The Consortium itself con-
sisted of 26 people broken into
three and four man teams
specializing in a particular
aspect of Egyptian life.

Fred Gaige, former Direc-
tor of International
Education, obtained a place
for Polley in the Consortium.

Most of the people involved
were from Indiana although
there was one research team
from New York. “I was the
only -one from North
Carolina,’’ said Polley.

going to D. C. Augustine, The
half ended with Davidson
holding a 1-0 lead.

Davidson got on the
scoreboard quickly in the
second half, with Billy Hawk
taking a Jack Linard ppass,
and making the score 2-0.

The defense continued to
deny S. C. a goal, as Charlie
Slagle continued his stellar
goal-tending.

Halfway through the second
half, senior Joe Duncan got a
goal, scoring on a feed by Paul
Schleiffer. —

. The Cats got a momentary
scare, when potential All-—
American Tom Blackwood
was shaken up when he ran
into some benches along the
sidelines. However, it turned
out too be nothing too serious.
The game ended 3-0, David-
son.

The Davidson defense,
which had been a little shaky,
has appeared to solve its
problems, with this shut-out
being its second in a row.

The Cat’s next game is at 4-

p. m. this afternoon as The
Citadel travels to Davidson.

Davidson lost its third con-
secutive game of the season
last Saturday to Wofford by a
score of 49-7.

Davidson’s. offense didn’t
get untracked until the third
quarter when they. drove deep
into Wofford territory. The
drive was stalled, but the
Wildcat defense was able to
contain Wofford for three
plays.

The ensuing Wofford kick

was poor and Davidson took
over with excellent field
position. With the ball inside
the Wofford 40, quarterback
David Harper directed
another Davidson drive which
culminated in a seven yard
touchdown pass from Harper
to Chris Harris.-

The remainder of the game
was played, for the most part,
between the 20-yard lines. Joel
Golmont led a drive to the
Wofford 10-yard line in the
fourth quarter with relief help
from Gary Overstreet. But the
‘drive was stalled by penalties
and the Wildcats failed to
score.

After the game, Coach
Farrell ‘said, ‘‘We - had
prepared well but the
execution wasn’t there. The
players aren’t doing in the
game what they did in prac-
tice.”’

Farrell went on to explain
that he thought it was due to
frustration rather than lack of
desire. ‘‘When one man
doesn’t do his job on defense
then the man next to him
would try to help him out.
When this happens, we have
two men instead of just one
who is not playing his pos-
ition correctly.”’

“Personnel wise, there was
no reason that we should have

been that far out of the Wof-
ford game,”’ he added.

A‘It was a combination of our
having a great deal of break-
downs on defense and Wofford
coming out with a good game
plan against us and executing
it well.”’

Offensively Farrell saw
some improvement over
previous games, particularly
in pass blocking, but it is not
yet moving the football
satisfactorily. .

In regard to the season as a
whole, Farrell said, “I thought
we would have been further
along at this point.” But he
refuses to make any excuses
about the inept play thus far.

He added that “‘there is no
question about their en-
thusiasm and desire to win.”’

Farrell calls this week’s op-
ponent, Lenoir Rhyne, ‘im-
pressive.” ‘“‘They have a ten-
dency to get very emotional
after a big play, and the whole
team becomes very ex-
plosive.”
