EXTRA OPPOSITION GIVEN
DECLAIMERS

Time was when everyone thought it-quite
sufficient that every literary society on the
Hill choose Fresh-Soph de-
claimers, award him a medal, and go on its
way rejoicing over good work well done.
As a result of this lack of interest among
the leaders, younger speakers, as a rule, did
not make serious preparation for the event.
Indeed, one veteran was heard to remark that

‘he had “re-vamped” an old high school |
speech, given it, and won a medal. |
- But the old order changeth. Those who!
|have the interests of literary work most at |
‘heart have decided to submit a plan whereby |

the winner in each society shall meet and »

contest with winners from the other literary |
societies for the championship of all the so- |
cieties in Fresh-Soph declamation. To win
that kind of contest would make real prepa-
ration a‘necessity, and not an optional affair.
The joint contest will probably be held in
the first week of December. It is hoped
that this innovation marks a turning toward
higher standards of literary excellence for
Davidson.
FEASIBLE PLAN ADOPTED
FOR RESERVING -
TENNIS COURT

A means for remedying the present ineffi-
cient method of reserving the tennis courts
has been found. Within the next few weeks
a tennis board will be put up near the Chem
istry building. Upon this the players may
reserve a-certain court for a certain time,

The board will be something like this: A
large blackboard will be divided into) two
sections. On one side the rales of the courts
will be drawn up and on the other the vari
ous courts (North, Mast, East Center, ete.),
under each of which will be painted the daily

schedule :
2:00 P.M, Sally 1, OWI
3:15. P. M..— 4:30 P. M,
4:30 P.M. — 5:30 P.M,
5:30 P.M. 6:30 P.M.

Opposite these hours the player must sign
up for the court that he wants,
time‘in the morning will be set after which
the reservations may be made, Tf he does
not appear by a certain time he forfeits the
court. Other rules that become
will be added.

The arrangements for putting up the board
have not been completed but the promoters
of the idea assure its erection in the near
future. This method of teserving tennis
courts has proved successful at the Univer
sity of Virginia and several of the Western
colleges. It promises to be equally successful
here at Davidson.
