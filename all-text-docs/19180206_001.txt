Junior Speaking Date
Remains Unchanged

Junior Oratoricals Will Begin On
March the First

Contrary to the announcement appear-
ing in the last issue of “THe Davipson-
IAN, Junior Speaking will be held on
March rst and 2nd.

The many Juniors who are anxiously
waiting for a chance to show their talents
alang the lines of oratory are a little dis-
appointed that the date for Junior Speak-
ing was not changed to February 22nd
and 23rd as was planned. Junior Speak-
ing will be held March ist and and, as
the catalog states. This allows them
three weeks in which to work on their
orations, and in this time some of them
should be able to compose speeches which
would make Demosthenes himself bow
his head in submission. ‘The program
committee expects to have a complete
list of the speakers and their subjects by
the next issue of Trt Davipsonian.

RECENT RESOLUTION

OF THE STUDENT BODY

Due to the presence of several cases
of meningitis in Charlotte and because
of the danger of spreading this dreadful
disease, the student body unanimously
adopted the following resolution: Re-
solved, That no student. shall go to
Charlotte before Wednesday, February
13, unless absolutely necessary (that is,
unless the Faculty gives permission to
go.) This action was taken voluntarily
by the students in order to co-operate
with the officials of Charlotte in their
endeavor to stamp out this disease, at the
same time it is an act of self-defense in
an effort to prevent the spreading of the
disease to the campus.

Visitor—“At what time do you have
dinner, my little friend ?”
Terrible Boy—‘'Soon as you’ve gone.”

Another Victory Is

Large Crowd Witnesses First Game
On New Gym Floor

The Davidson quint played its first
game on the home floor last week, win-
ning from Guilford Friday night by a
score of 37-24. “The Davidson Orches-
tra, Jasz Band and the Davidson ladies
were all out, so the team simply had to
win in self-defense.

Guilford drew first blood in the first
few minutes of play when Jones caged a
foul goal. A few seconds afterwards
Davidson got a field goal and maintained
a lead the rest of the game. ‘Fhe first
half ended 20 to 12 in favor of David:
son.

Guilford made a desperate attempt at
a come-back in the last half and outplas
ed the local quint. but the work of
Hengeveld kept pace with them. Daven-
port also did good work in the last half.

For the visitors, Babb, at guard, and
Jones, at forward, featured. In his first
game with the ‘Varsity, Davenport, for
Davidson, played a good game at  for-
ward. Hengeveld caged seven field
goals, while the floor work of George
King was up to its usual standard. King
was far and away the fastest man on the
floor, The guarding of McAskill and
McAllister was good. but good team
work was conspicuously absent.

The line-up:

GUILFORD. POSITION. DAVIDSON.
Zachary.........LG0...... McAskill
Babb. oo... 02... RG..... McAllister
Groome......... C..... _¢ Hengeveld
Jones (C).......UR0..0.0.. King

Referee: Romefelt. ‘Time of halves:
20 minutes. Substitutions: Newlin for
Babb. Field goals: King, 7; Hengeveld.,

DAVIDSON COLLEGE. DAVIDSON, N. C.. FEBRUARY 6, 1918.

General Davidson’s

Grave Unmarked

Mountain Mission
Work is Deseribed

Revolutionary Hero Was Buried at|Bellingrath Gives Full Account of

Hopewell Church.

‘The man for whom Davidson College
is named lies buried near here at Hope
well Church. “Phis man is Gen. Wii-
liam Lee Davidson, “who, in the ardor
of patriotism, tearlessly contending for
the liberty of the country, fell) (univer
sally lamented) in the battle of Cowan's
Ford.”

Recently a party of interested David-
sonians thru the aid of Alexander’s His-
tors of the Hopewell Section, was able
to locate the resting place of the pa
triot. Extending the length of the- grave
is a bench of brick which, having been
constructed more than a century ago, is
now crumbling into decay. Sleeping be
side him is his daughter in-law, Mrs. W.
lL. Davidson, Jr.. this grave making ot
possible to identify the one of the Revo
lutionary hero.

General Davidson, ina skirmish with
Coriwallis’ forces, was killed ar Gow
an's Ford on Februnry 1. 6781. Prob
ably to prevent detention his ‘remains
were brought and interred at midnight
in the present prave.

He was a young man—full of vigor
and loyalty. A bright) future was
clipped at thirty-five years of age. “Vhe
Government has erected on the Guilford
Battle Ground to his memory a granite
‘arch costing $5,000. “There is also a
callege of noble spirited young men, a
large per cent of whom may die in the
sameway fighting for the ultimate diffiu-
sion of democracy, who are glad to be
known as Davidson men.

It is fitting that the Government
should) commemorate his valor. It
peculiarly fitting that a college— world
known—should be named in his honor.
The spot where he lies buried is nez-
lected, unmarked, and little known. “To
have gained such distinction in battle and
to he commemorated in sculpture and in
the embodiment of Christian education
as he is there should be a monument or
slab identifying his grave from. its sur
roundings. “To all) Davidson men this

yw

Lshould be a shrine to which they should

go and pay reverence.

Tt is one thing to be overtaken with
a fault. and another thing to overtake it.
-P. Henry.

Work in Kentucky

G. C. Bellingrath, the speaker at the
Y. M. C. A. Mountain Mission meet-
ing last “Thursday evening, upheld his
reputation as an orator. His talk dealt
with the mountain people, their customs,
and the particular features of life in Dry
Fork, Letcher County, Ky. “Phe coun-
try is some of the roughest in the State.
Bellingrath, with several other David-
son omen, spent last summer up there
teaching and preaching to the people. “Po
say that his. talk was interesting is put-
ting it mildly. His description of the
mountaineers, their simple life. and their
ignorance. was very vivid. He mentioned
the fact that many college students can
do the work and they need men every
summer. [t is not a life of luxuary by
any means, but the good that can be
done and the novelty of. the experience
should lead at least a few Davidson men
to go up there this: summer, as the need
will be greater than ever before.

DEBATING FINALS

CONSECRATION MEETING
OF CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR

The consecration meeting of | the
Christian Endeavors for February was
held Sunday night, February ard. The
meeting was led by J. A. ‘Thames. In
discussing the topic, “Winning Others
to Christ,” the following idea was
brought out, that of all the great prob-
lems we have to deal with today the
problem of spreading Christianity is by
far the greatest, and this can best be
done by personal work. When people
are won to Christ we must put them to
work, We must not only win them.
we must keep them.

The topic pamphlets will be given out
next Sunday night.
