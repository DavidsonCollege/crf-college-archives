PAGE TWO

Student Apathy To Artist Series
True Picture Of Davidson Culture

A recent editorial in the Furman
Hornet decried what it referred to as “a
cultural lag at Furman” in the failure of
the University to present a full series of
well known artists for the benefit of the
students during the college year. The Uni-
versity, stated the editorial, sponsors but
two programs this year, these being lec-
tures by John C. Caldwell, diplomat, and
John Mason Brown, critic. The only other
chance for Furman students to attend cul-
tural performances is through the Com-
munity Concerts, and tickets to these con-
certs at a special student rate are limited
to only 100 of Furman’s 1400 students,
these students being channeled to the bal-
cony for the performance.

In referring to the advantages that
the cultural programs of other colleges
have over Furman, the editorial made the
following statement: ‘Take note of such
collegiate culture programs as those at
Clemson and Davidson.”

Furman University at Greenville has
recognized a need in their cultural lag
and which Davidson students in their rich-
ness of cultural opportunity seem totally

unaware. Furman looks upon Davidson’

with envy because to her mind we have
an outstanding artist series program. Yet
the students at Davidson, who have neith-
er to pay special prices nor to sit in the
balcony, are utterly blind in their failure
to take advantage of the artist series. In-
deed, if it were not for the townspeople
and people from Charlotte who journey
miles to see famous personalities and or-
ganizations, it is beyond speculation that
during certain presentations the perform-
ers would outnumber the audience. Such
a situation is not only abominable, but is
a direct reflection upon our present-day
society.

Furman might be jealous of Davidson
for the artist series which our college
makes available for her students, but Da-
vidson might well be jealous of Furman
for appreciating the fact that college is
more than a round of bookmarks and
weekends, that it is the only period in
life when one has time to take advantage
of culture, and that since this is true ev-
ery effort to give that culture to him
should be employed.

Perhaps we should send our artist se-
ries south. It would be more appreciated.

The Student Manifesto: To Look On
And Never Make A Sound

Perhaps those who return this week-
end to Davidson for the first time in a
year or more wonder as they look about
them what the student mind thinks now,
whether or not the men in college fatigue
clothes who pass them on the way to the
library or those who pass them in tux on
the way to the dance think as they did
those years back when .. . We must be
frank in stating that we do not know, for
from where we stand we cannot measure
the minds of men twenty years ago ex-
cept in the scanty way of recalling the so-
cial history of the time.

We remember from our history, or
perhaps from Frederick Lewis Allen, that
when many of you were students the cold
tones of the saxophone blared out into an
age when everybody questioned every-
thing, when girls were demanding rights
and tearing into the old mores to a de-
gree to make their Victorian parents
wince, and when roadsters and Fatimas
and lipstick and beauty parlors and dress-
makers and prohibition and boom were
the words of the day.

If we stretch ourselves back into dim
boyhood most of us who are students can
remember the days of the ’30’s. Every-
thing cost less but no one was as rich as
today. There was that brief period of boy-
hood when we played with tin soldiers
and took summer trips, but all that was
soon swept away in something that also
swept away tin cans, sugar, coffee, and
our older brothers or fathers. For the next
four years we grew, contenting ourselves
with plastic toys and pictures of ‘“Mus-
tangs” and “Corsairs,” till the war was
over and everyone said things would get
“back to normal.”

It is of this period of getting “back to
normal” that today’s Davidson students
are a product. You who graduated in
years past might want to know just what
sort of a product that is, and it is inter-
esting for us to find out ourselves, for
ours has been a strange age of unparal-
lelled richness and danger.

We grew up in a time when day after
day we heard the hue and cry of all the
world dangers on the one hand while on
the other our homes, towns and persons
were stacked high with the material bene-
fits following the war. On one side, then,
we have been faced with nebular thorns
in the flesh to such an extent that we
have ceased to prick up our ears every
time Uncle Sam cries “wolf!”, while on the

other side we have drunk deep of the wat-
ers of material benefits, and as we forgot
the major problems of life we have filled
the vacancy left in our unthinking minds
by television screens, hamburgers, dime
magazines and novels, flicks, whisky,
beach vacations and a thousand other little
things to get our attention off anything
but the present.

Living in a generation when no one
is sure what will happen, we have tried to
put off any decision by forgetting the
problem. The result has been a perfect
apathy, as we coolly argued about putting
coffee in sugar bowls, whether freshmen
should wear name tags till November 1,
why we ought to have free cuts, or what
professor gives the least trouble on re-
views; while around the world nations
are reverberating and continents are
seething with a steam which will eventu-
ally blow the face off civilization; while
new and more powerful bombs are de-
veloped daily, and while streaks across the
sky tell us that they may be delivered to
us without the slightest warning.

Religion is no longer the opiate of the
people, if it ever was. No, to the present
day student at Davidson religion pleads
for an awakening to the important things
of life: for a regard for the people of the
world; for a faith that governs life; for
awakening people who will reach out in
love to save civilization before the strife-

-Tidden elements destroy it. But the

opiates other’ than religion are ever
stronger, and the lethargy was never more
profound, for who wouldn't rather watch
television than read the great authors who
had ideas, and who wouldn't rather salve
their consciences with some of the cur-
rent sugared-up gospels of the business
economy than walk through the strait gate
described by Christ.

Here we stand, unbloodied as yet, but
completely bowed. It is much easier to go
with the tide than to stand alone. Why
should we have a purpose? Why should
we fight for a belief when we have learn-
ed that all are “purely relative” anway?
It is so much easier to be a hollow man
among hollow men than to be a martyr.
We have learned that there is a current
unpopularity of martyrs anyway.

To you who are alumni we extend a
welcome, and say that it is still up to
those who have gone before us to prove
to us that life is more than rounds of busi-
ness deals, conventions, and golf.

FOR HOMECOMING

$61,000! It’s Well Worth Every
Thousand That We Spend Of It

It has been estimated by a schol-
arly inquirer that this week end
in progress will drain assorted
pocketbooks of the sum of $61,000
in frigid currency. In the polled
opinion of most believers, home-
coming weekend is worth every
thousand of it—and more. Let us
gaze at some of the facts.

There were the long weeks of
preparation: cars polished to per-
fection by pledges’ voluntary ef-
forts; the hours of daydreaming
and meditation on Esquire editor-
jals; diligent study and memoriza-
tion of the best of Playboy and
other litérary editions; the mid-
night ride of Lady Shaftesbury;
endless searching for a sack, trans-
portation, date, etc.; preparation
of the room for the coming attrac-
tions; how to get eight human be-
ings in one coupe without wrin-
kles; long hours of “lodge decora-
tions;” and fihally the evacuation.

Then—wham!—the indescribable
invasion of skirts from the outer
world.

There follows the hour of charm
with Ogden (“God in His wisdom
made the fly, and then forgot to
tell us why”) Nash with his 8634
verses of wit, humor, and clever
critique.

Then to the dance floor where
amid the gay and suggestive dec-
orations the twirling mass con-
tinues its fun, frolic, and festivity
to the rhythmic swing of Smilin’
Sam Donshue and orchestra.

GRAGGISM HIT TOO

BY DICK MOREHBAD

First in 14 Years

On Saturday comes the muscle
match ‘between the up-and-ready
Wildcats and John L. Lewis’ Gold-
en Bears with its flag waving, loud
musie, decorative mums, shouting
and buttons portraying the hard
fact that this is the “first in 14
years.” There will be no button
burning Saturday afternoon!

Always the boarding house fias-
co where brothers make profuse
apologies concerning the abomin-
able selection of condiments while
restraining themselves from their
first square meal in months.

But the inevitable end — and
the morning after: with the ex-
tended physiognomy, well devel-
oped eye sockets, and the mopey
blues; that trembling touch on the
PO box, hoping that headquarters
hasn't uncovered the blasted bank
balance or the slightly tired con-
dition of the community car; the
re-orientation into education—and
the memories.

Beware!

A word of caution, however, to
the southern belles;

“Her mother never told her, the
things a young girl should know;
about the ways of college boys,
and how they come and go—”

Beware of the educated fresh-
man — who subtly maneuvers you
into a dark corner, snuffs out the
last remnant of light, tenderly
presses your palm, and then pro-
ceeds to expound on the horrors of

stud duty, the low life of a pledge,
the impending doom of a theme
paper, or his unbounded courage
in facing the miseries of the fresh-
man race. He may have the wrong
idea.

Beware of the pegged prancer —
who jogs over to your corner, asks
if you would care to “dig the next
frantic jive” and then proceeds to
whirl you through a jolting jumbo
of the Birmingham bounce, Mom-
bo, Beetle’s Bop, and the Shady
Boogie. You may not make it to
Sunday School the next morning.

Beware of the “men” who do
but shouldn’t, the ones who never
stagger or fall. There may not be
a pledge around to play chaffeur
(or any wood alcohol).

Beware of the enthusiastic as-
tronomer who invites you to span
and speculate upon the celestial
bodies. It may be a cloudy night.

Beware of ‘Cop’ Linker. He has
a flashlight.

Beware of the senior .. . Re-
member, he has been here some
three years, exprienced nine “big”
weekends, some six minor blasts,
numerous deputations, enlivened
bull sessions, and one “Y” ex-
change day dance. He may be dan-
gerous.

Beware of the former grad who
belabors the glory of the “good old
days.” We have just as much to
shout about — $61,000 — it’s
worth every thousand of it.

Laundry And Student’s Servants
Defended; Little Mencken Hit

BY ERNEST TAYLOR

It has been the resolve of The
Davideenlan to serve as the pro-
mulgator of legitimate, construc-
tive criticism, a resolve which it
has creditably realized. However,
The Davidsonion is not the place
for such cheap journalism as the
petty, gratuitous diatribe which
Little Mencken launched against
the college laundry in last Friday's
publication.

Whether eur Little Mencken
fe sincere in his criticism or is

talents, | de net know. What |
de knew Is thet his denuncie-
tien Is the extreme in hyper-
bele, unfair te the laundry, and
enything but amusing.

Were the employees of the laun-
dry as indifferent to their jobs
and as negligent as Little Mencken
insinustes, they would all have
been replaced long ago. Further-
more, I know that they are rather
conscientious about their duties;
and were I an employee of the col-
lege laundry, I would resent and
be deeply hurt by such a categori-
cal damnation.

I, too, have suffered a few lost
buttons, found my khaki pants
sometimes too stiff to don, and

grumbled over the slight discolora-
tion of my socks and underwear.
Such occurrences are, I believe,
exceptional and are not any indica-
tion of the generally adequate job
realized in the laundry, which I
contend {s doing a creditable,
thought far from perfect, perform-
ance.

Then why must cur Little
Menckens consistently carp at
the laundry and at other serv-
ices rendered by the college?
Perhaps it is because they are
the product of the upper-middle
end lower-upper classes, extoll-
ed by these complacent expon-
ents of Graggism, Individuals
who have never known what it
is te perform a manual or men
tel task and who probably never
i.

There is in the student body this
small segment that will be ad-
versely critical of everything that
is done on this campus and will
gripe and grunt regardless of what
the school authorities do. I doubt
if God Himself could placate the
grumblings of these pseudo-perfec-
tionists, who, between you and me,
are the most pitiable of creatures.

I am among those who work in
the Union (if you will allow me the
liberty of the use of the term

“work’® to describe what we do).
Our main interest is in the con-
tents of our pay envelopes, and
we are sometimes guilty of glaring
slovenliness and inefficiency,
thought generally we attempt to
execute our jobs conscientiously
and effectively. We are grateful
that most of the student body at-
tribute good intentions to our ef-
forts and overlook our faults. They
realize that we are in a dilemma in
trying to fulfill the exacting de-
mands of the employer, as well
as the equally exacting de-
mands of the students. (it is the
former, of course, whose demands
we meet.)

Since | have been at Davidson,
1 have been so satiated with this
demnable querulousness that !
wish | were able te belch every
tote of it from my system. As e
last resort § would asimos? suc-
cumb to Mr. Gragg’s simpte phi-
losophy of humble optimism.
(which has now been modified to
realistic optimism.)

In his article, Little Mencken
urges us not to “pity ourselves or
languor because of our misfor-
tunes .. .” because “. . . someone
has more troubles than we.” Would
that all our Little Menckens had
some real problems,

JOES: HOLY AND OTHERWISE

A Search For Our
Personal Motives

BY LEIGHTON MeCUTCHEN

To be labeled a “Holy Joe” is a
severe condemnation. As I under
stand it, a “Holy Joe” is one who
thinly disguises his self-pride with-
in a claim to be upholding right-
eousness. He refuses to associate
or “pulls away” not only from
wrong-doing, but from the wrong-
doer. He is not really interested in
the one that he condemns, but in
his owg purity and the “standards
of rightness.” In the name of the
highest of disciplines — Christiani-
ty — he practices its antithesis,
i.e. a devotion to his own impor-

tance.
An “Unhely Jee”?

Although there are some “Holy
Joes” here on this campus, they
are not in the majority. Rather
most of us tend to follow a varia-
tion on this theme and are what
might be called “Unholy Joes.”
Anyone who refuses to identify
himself with a person who is odd
or different, pulling away from
him, and pointing at him the fin-
ger of scorn or derision is really
an “unholy Joe.”

This Joe deosn't use the cleak
of religion te mask his pride.
He hides it behind standards of
humer, or ef secial conformity,
or the god of normality. Essen-
tially hewever he dees the same
thing as the “Hely Jee,” that
is he pulls away net ently fram
the act which is incompotible
with his set ef values (er just
plein geefy), but pulls eway
from the persen acting as well.

A Better Wey
To you who say: “But I thought
we were to maintain certain stan-
dards, and not to follow the crowd
always.” This is the question—why
are you maintaining those stan-

dards: to show God how good you
are or to show people how good
God is? If it is the latter, then
look at your method again. For
Jesus never used it.

Rather than point down at peo-
ple, He identified Himself fully
with all men—the “worst” and the
“best’—and pointed them to God.
He didn't live by just condemning
wrong, but by associating with
wrong-doers and loving them away
from their shabby lives. Not that
He was sentimental about it; dying
on a cross is not the’way of a sen-
timentalist. “He hated sin, but lov-
ed the sinner,” for He saw what
each person could be after being
foved.

A Seerching For Motives

To you who are incensed by
“Holy Joes”: look deep into your
motives. If you are angry at hy-
pocrisy and choose to heap scorn
on it, then you are using a meth-
od followed by Jesus, for he said
his bitterest words against hy-

But if yeu ere med af some-
bedy “for showing up one of
your pet faults and thereby try-
ing te lock better than you,
check carefully. He may be real-
ly concerned more with your
growth than you are—ie. he
may love you in the best sense.
t¢ yeu let the sting of truth
blind yeu te real goodwill, then
yeu have fellen into e trep pe-
tented by the Chief Unholy Joe
‘hienself.

He loves self-esteem more than
the light of revealing love. In fact
he calls genuine love blasphemy
so as to keep it from changing his
values based on devotion to him-
self. They crucified a certain Jesus
for blasphemy. Was it because he
loved them far better than they
even loved themselves? How can
you love somebody, and hate some
of the things that he does?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Court Of Control Failing In Its
Duty; Possible Solutions Proposed

Dear Editor:

In writing this letter, I am not
attacking the character or person-
ality of any individual member of
the Court of Control. Since the dis-
continuance of its meetings in
chaple, there seems to be little in-

terest on the part of the upper-
classmen as to what the fresh-
men do. _

‘in my twe years en this cam

pus it hes been the custom of

I feel that the court is falling
short of its duties. There have
been fewer hat-checks in chapel.
And if one isn't a member of the
court or a freshman appearing be-
fore the court, one does not know

DC Paper Should
Carry National,
Foreign Opinions

Dear Editor: =

Don’t you think it would be a
momentous and thrilling idea to
carry the scope of your newspaper
beyond the “l-mile” problems we
have here at Davidson and include
some of the $2,500 miles” of prob-
lems faced by this world? Doesn't
somehow the faet that two-thirds
of the people of the world go to
bed hungry every night arouse
greater feeling in you than the
naughty conduct of students in
chapel?

Don't get me wrong. I wouldn't
for a minute suggest that you for
sake our many Davidson problemas
(which we all strive so nobly to
bear), but maybe sometime if you
had a quarter of a column to fill,
rather than extending ‘Caton’s
Crud Corner” or “Gilbert's Gib-
erish,” why not throw in some ran-
dom article on the U. N., S.A.
T.0,. the forthcoming elections,
Pres. Eisenhower's prestige, or
hurricane Hazel? Last week's ar-
ticle on segregation was a much
needed step in the right direction.

Sincerely,

ishment is.

1 see three possible solutions
te the problem of keeping the
upperclassmen informed: 1) hav-
ing an announcement of what
hes gene on in the Friday chap-
ob; 2) printing a “Black List” in
the Davidsonian each week; or
3) restoring the court to its nor-
mal position In chapel.

Duke Numbering
System Suggestion

Dear Editor:

I'm certain that the architects
of Duke dormitory had some room
numbering system in mind when
they planned the various sections.
What the numbers were to be,
however, must have been placed in
the cornerstone along with the
blueprints, because it is evident
to anyone who has ever tried to
find a certain room that absolute-
ly no sane system exists which will
make it easy to find the desiréd

4 Foom.
A Medest Proposal

I don't see why something can’t
be done to relieve this situation.
There are probably any number
of solutions however, until they are
forthcoming, I would like to offer
‘the following modest proposal:

Thirdfioer Duke—Begin ef
the west side and number direct.
ly seross, e. g., 301, 302, ete.

West side of Duke (first two
Sleers)—W101, W102, ete.; W201,
W202, ete. for the second fleer
of the West section.

Gaet side ef Duke (first two
$leers)—8101, £102, etc.; &201,
202, ete., for the second floor
of the Bact section.

Center section of Duke (First
twe fleers)—C101, C102, efe.;
C261, C202, ete. for the second
fleer ef the center section.

Sincerely,

John Fite

Question Of Duty

Dear Editor:

Is it more important to fulfill a
duty to a college rule made for the
benefit of all, qr to fulfill s duty
of love to a fellow human being?

Sincerely,
Jack Bolen
