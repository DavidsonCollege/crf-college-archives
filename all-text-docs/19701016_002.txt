“Our recommendations be-

‘‘We propose that the fresh-
men this year be consulted
as to what form their social
life takes this year, but re-
garding the class of 1975
and beyond,-we recommend
that prior to next fall the
freshmen be randomly as-
signed to one of these’ nine
eating clubs.

“They would be reassign-
ed nbacciand at the end of

each term, thus gaining a
look at  tthree_ different
houses on the court. At the
end of the year they would
self-select a house.

The freshmen would still
cat at the Union, but their
social life would be at
whichever house they were
affiliated with at the mo-
ment,

“Upper classmen would be
on a self-selection basis al-
so. They could change at the
end of every term, or they
could stay in the same house

maining years at Davidson.

facully and was granted a
free hand in working out the
mechanics for implementa-
tion with the registrar and
the EPC.

Commenting on the recep-
tive nature of the faculty,
Bevan said, ‘‘I think basic-
ally the feeling was ‘Let’s
try it.’” Coble, however, at-
tributed much of the success
at the meeting to ‘‘Bevan’s
charisma.”

There were several objec-
tions to the proposal. The
most vital one questioned the
strain of self-scheduled exams
on the honor system.

Another argument was that
a student on his own ‘would
stack his exam schedule, pro-

be SS Si Ra

moting wholesale cramming
at the expense of serious
studying. Bevan remarked
that ‘‘cramming is cram-
ming,” and said he did not
see how the proposal would
affect this technique for stu-
ying at all.

The Basic problems in im-
plementing the program in-
volve the added pressure on
professors to meet deadlines
and arrangements for stu-

Speaking in favor of the
proposal, Bevan stated: ‘‘We
ought to be providing opti-
mum opportunity to show
optimum performance. May-
be this step will provide some
impetus to. try some other
approaches to evaluation.”

At the meeting,
all but two of these pro-«
posals received less than
unanimous votes: the non-

ciple was passed, 124, and
the proposal that only those
affiliated with on-campus
houses pay the housing fee
passed, 13-5.

“These proposals aren't
final, in any rate,’’ com-
mented Coble. “This out-

line is just a basic statement
of the minutes of the meet-
ing, and we plan to discuss
it more in the future.”

The printed recommenda-
tions added one postscnipt
about the organization of
the eating clabs:

“The individual organiza-
tion can decide how that
organization is to operate.
We expect that in some
“fraternity”
group would form a nucleus
for that, organization to
which there would be an in-
flux of freshmen, and self-
selected upperclassman
would be added.

“In other cases, a group
might decide to have no or-
ganization whatsoever and
serve purposes just of eat-
ing together as a_ small
group. The frequency of so-
cial activities is another
moot point and within the
decision realm of each or-
ganization, ‘

“The basic premise, how-
ever, is that each-organiza-
tion ‘can be whatever it
wants to be while allowing
every individual at David-
son College to choose what
kind of social alternative he
wants.”’

“This system would pro-
vide good aspects of mobili-
ty and vanriety,”’ Coble add-

d. ‘It puts the choice for a
social system back jin the
hands of the individual, not
in the hands of the organiza:
tion,’

Some Houses Charging
Improper Representation

By SCOTT DAVIDSON
News Editor

During the lagt week be-
fore the trustees’ vote on
the fraternity issue, the pro-
and antjfraternity factions
have conducted fierce cam-
peigns for the representa-
tion of their viewpoints in
the trustees’ meeting vester-
day and today.

For the first time since
the address of Samuel R.
Spencer. Jr., president of the
college, the group favoring
the ‘‘status quo’ has taken a
strong stance in readiness
for thé coming  confronta-
tion:

Some students strongly op-
posed the method of repre-
sentation devised for. the
presentation of the issues a
the trustees.

Three. students, Ran Coble,

representing the student
body in general, Charlle
Ralston, representing the

antifraternity interests, and
Johnny Bruner, representing
the Interfraternity Council
(IFC) were scheduled to
speak fo the trustees,

The profraternity faction
argued that representation
of their viewpoint would be
inadequate.

They said that since the
fraternities were split
among. themselves, Bruner
in respect to his position as
president of the IFC, would
not be able to present a
strong~enough defense for
the present fraternity sys-
tem.

Bruner admitted that his
primary concern is to see
that ‘‘all points of view
are represented.” Bruner
explained that a group of
students met with Dean of
Students, Richard C. Burts,
on Tuesday and Wednesday,
in an effort to seek better
representation.

Bruner noted, “A crowd
felt that there was no strong
advocate of their point of
view.”

Burts said that he would
do everything in his power
to choose a representative to
present a_ platform -to the
irustees. “It is my interest
that everything be brought
out into the open,” he said.

In the past week, two ma-
jor surveys were taken by
and Wick

ternity members and_ the
other polled members of the
freshmen class.

In the first, a petition was
distributed to each of the
twelve fraternities asking
for affirmation of the pre-
sent fraternity system by
signatures te the petition.

The strongest .vote of af-
firmation came from the
SAE fraternity with 92 per
cent of their members sup-
porting the petition, Second

were the KA’s (86 per cent) .

followed by the Sigma Chis
(84 percent), the Sig Eps
(74 per cent), and the Kappa
Sigs (64 per cent),

The Phi Delis, ATOs and

‘ly, no.

Sigma Nus returned their
petitions with less than 50
per—cem of their members
signing, and the Betas, the
Pi Kapps, the Phi Gams,
and the Pikas returned their
petitions unsigned.

There were many Critics
of this system. One pointed
out that although the Phi
Delt fraternity registered
one of the lowest votes of
support,.a simple hatid
vote administered Wednesday
night revéaled that over 90
per cent of the members
présent favored preserving

“The present system in -fieu

of accepting any of the pro-
posed alternatives,

Patterson said, ‘‘We do not
claim the validity in any
way, but we think it repre-
sents the way the fraterhi-
ties are spread on the _pre-
sent issues.’

The second survey-—was
administered to the mem-
bers of the freshmen class.
A questionaire was distribut-
ed to every freshman asking
whether they were in favor
of participating in rush.
Patterson emphasized that
this was not necessarily to
indicate support of the act-
ual fraternity system.

Patterson stated. that 80.7
per cent of the freshmen re-
sponded to the survey, and
of his percentage, 83.4 fa-
vored proceeding with rush
while-only 16.6 per cent were
opposed.

Bill Ralston, newly elected
President of the freshman
class, sald, “Like most all
freshmen, | came expecting
a chance to join a fraterni-
ty, and | am discouraged
that I won't be exposed.

“It doesn’t bother me like
it does a lot of freshmen. It
won't be something I can’t
overcome,"’ he said. ‘‘But I
think about every freshman
wants to go out for rush,
whether to join or not’’

When asked if he felt both
sides of the issue had been
presented, he said, ‘‘Honest-
I don't think they
have.

“There was a student at-
mosphere and a senate at-
mosphere present before
freshmen got here and be-
fore I went to a senate meet-
ing. In other-words, the sen-
ate had discussed fraterni-
ties prior to our first meet-
ing and we voted the first
night."’

The Pi Kappa Alpha fra-
ternity has opened its doors
to all students, excluding
non-members only from
their meetitig:” What -could
be easily interpreted here as
a_ strong endorsement of
Spencer, did not receive too
much reaction on the frater,
nity court. ;

John Bolinger, president
of -ATOs, said, ‘‘I don’t be-
lieve it will have a great
effect on the trustees, Spen-
cer or the student body. As.
far as stunning the frater-.
nities, I think THE DAVID-
SONIAN has overstated the.
case,"
