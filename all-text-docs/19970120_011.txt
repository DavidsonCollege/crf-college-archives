THE DAVIDSONIAN

Male wet t-shirt contest gives
an alternative to Self-selection

By JEFFERY CROMARTIE
Staff Writer

Among the usual wild,
drunken .pledges running around
getting to know first hand what
hypothermia is all about, some-
thing truly amusing happened on
the Court. Under the guidance of
independent leader Matthew
Hobbie, the Union Outpost held
the first annual male wet t-shirt
contest. A truly fine stock of hearty
Davidson males were baptized by
the Bacchian spirits and began a
mesmerizing sequence of table and
floor dancing. i

A few of-the dancers chose to
tease the front row packed full of
howling ladies. . Zhenya
Arutyanyan remarked, “It was a
good alternative to Self-Selection.
The audience had just as much
emotion as the people participat-
ing in house events.”

The roaring crowd reponse
was judged by a group of peers,
and first, second, and third place
prizes were distributed, Sophomore
John Paulus, affectionately known
as Pope, seized the third place prize
with his charming looks and his
graceful style of floor swimming
without the aid of music.

Dan Wingate. employed his
hulking deltoids ‘in combination
with a dynamic flexing pattern
which pleased the crowd earning
him second place. The winner of
Friday night’s contest decided to
escalate matters by turning the con-
test into a wet underwear contest.

Austin Rios let it all loose as he
preformed the classic swinging
gonad shuffle. Ladies roared their

. approval and sent unbridled ex-

citement gushing through the room.
Austin dedicated his performance
to his dear mother.

Instead of running around na-

__ked with mindless pledges simply

having fun and getting sick, the
men’s stunning dance raised a
healthy sum to be donated to the
Ada Jenkins Center. The judges,
the dancers, and the crowd pro-
vided independents with a flavor-
ful option away from the Court.
Judge Megan Rolenc remarked,

“Although I wish the event had

lasted a little longer, it was cer-
tainly a success which attracted a
wide variety of people. Next year
we hope to have more dancers and
some added variation in the rou-
tines.”

After Will Bradshaw’s
preformance, he remarked, “I am
very happy that I have both lap and
table danced in the Union Outpost.
The whole event was a lot of fun,
and I salute Matthew Hobbie and

the rest of the independent sena- -

tors that made the event happen.
The Ada Jenkins Center is an im-
portant part of the community, and
this event is a really fun way to
support it.”

-Flutist performs in Hodson Hall

By Steve DUNCAN
Guest Writer

Last Thurday, January 16th,
the Davidson College music de-
partment presented a faculty re-
cital featuring flutist Elizabeth
Holler Ransom, a flute instructor
at Davidson and faculty member at
the Community Music School of
the North Carolina School of the
Arts. In the intimate performance
atmosphere of Hodson Hall, Ran-
som and pianist Margaret Cornwell
impressed a small audience with a
program of works from the 18th
through the 20th centuries.

The recital began with a flute
sonata by C. P. E. Bach. Ransom
coursed through the light and deli-
cately lilting melodies with an ease
and grace belying the technical
difficulty of this work. Next came
a programmatic work by Albert
Roussel, Joueurs de flite, show-
casing Ransom’s versatility of ex-
pression in four contrasting move-
ments, each a musical depiction of
a legendary or mythical flutist.
Following themwere works by
20th-century composers Aaron
Copland and Eugene Bozza. Ran-
som concluded the evening with a
stimulating rendition of Sergei
Prokofiev’s Sonata for Flute and
Piano, Op. 94, playing through the
four movements with a frivolity
and mirth befitting the exuberance

of this work.

Elizabeth Holler Ransom has
received international acclaim as a
soloist and chamber musician, hav-
ing performed in Germany, Italy,
France, Switzerland, and the
United States. Her collaboration
with pianist Margaret Cornwell,

also on staff at the North Carolina
School of the Arts in Winston-
Salem, has resulted in a musical
symbiosis, to the credit of the sen-
sitive and insightful playing of both
performers as expressed in the bril-
liant recital of January 16th.

and by individuals as they entered
the theater. This made the movie
less provocative and interesting.
Also, although the movie purports
to be neutral in telling the story, it
clearly portrays Flynt as a hero and
his opponents (Jerry Falwell,
Charles Keating) as hypocrites.
While his opponents may have been
hypocrites and wrong, that does
not mean Flynt was not a shrewd
businessman, more concerned with

his profit than the first amend-
, ment. Flynt is no hero. B
