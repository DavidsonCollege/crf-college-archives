What the NEW
HUMIDOR PACK

means to Camel Smokers*

OMPARE a package of Camels with
any other cigarette and note the
difference in the technique of packing.
Note that Camels are completely en-
closed in an outer transparent cover of
moisture-proof cellophane and sealed
air-tight at every point.

We call this outer shell the Humidor
Pack. It differs from the ordinary cello-
phane pack and while it is egg-shell
thin, it means a lot in terms of cigarette
enjoyment.

It means, for instance, that evapora-
tion is checkmated and. that Salt
Lake City can
now have as good

25 DAY CHART OF CIGARETTE MOISTURE LOSS
1 Average 50 packages * :

The Humidor Pack insures that. It
prevents the fine tobaccos of Camels
from drying out and losing any of their
delightful flavor.

Aside from cheap tobacco, two fac-
tors in a cigarette can mar the smoker’s
pleasure:

Fine particles of peppery dust if left
in the tobacco by inefficient cleaning
methods sting and irritate delicate
throat membrane.

Dry tobacco, robbed of its natural
moisture by scorching or by evapora-
tion gives off a hot smoke that burns
the throat with
every inhalation.

Check the difference yourself
It is a very simple matter to check the
difference between Humidor Packed

Camels and other ordinary dry cigarettes.

First of all you can feel the difference .
as you roll the cigarettes hetween your
fingers. Camels are full-bodied: and
pliable. A dry cigarette crumbles under
pressure and sheds tobacco.

If you will hold a cigarette to each ear
and roll them with your fingers you can
actually hear the difference.

The real test of course is to smoke them.
And here’s where the new Humidor Pack
proves a real blessing to the smoker.

As youinhale the cool, fragrant smoke

' from a Camel you get all the mildness

and magic of the fine tobaccos of which
it is blended.

But when you draw in the hot smoke
from a dried cigarette see how flat and
brackish it is by comparison and how
harsh it is to your throat. |

If you are a reguiar Camel smoker
you have already noticed what proper
condition of the cigarette means.

But if you haven’t tried Camels in
the new Humidor Pack you have a new
adventure with Lady Nicotine in store

Switch your affections for just one

day, then go back to your old love
tomorrow if you can,
