defensive game was superb. The Cat backfield
seemed to be a bit confused over the W. and L.
passing attack and it was this confusion that cost
the Cats those winning touchdowns.
B TEAM
The Davidson College Wildkittens came through down
in Bennettsville South Carolina last Friday with a 20-6
win over a strong P.J.C. team. Working together smoothly
against stiffer opposition than they
countered, the B Teamers, sparked by the bruising run-
ning of Bud Fowle and smashing tackling of Bernhard
came through with their fourth straight win of the
season. Don Watt, husky center for the Wildkittens put
on a one man show on defense, backing up the line with
precision tackling that left the Presbyterian J.C.’s won-

was Watt’s first real chance to prove his merit, as ankle
injuries had kept him tied to the bench except for briet
periods in the previous games, but Coach Story remarked
after seeing his exhibition Friday that he is one of the
best line backers he had seen this year. Bingham came
through with fine offensive and defensive play and seems
to be following in brother footsteps as a fine ball
player.
N.C. STATE-BACK. IN THE WIN-CAROLINA DEFEATED
After losing to V-P.I. last week the N.C. State
Wolfpack got back on the Victory Wagon by
trouncing V-.M.I. 49-7. It looks like the State boys
are back on it again with Howard Turner, the
All-Southern tailback racing all over the place.
He scooted 60 yards with a punt for one TD,
dashed around end 14 yards for another and
passed to Bloomquist for ‘still another, which is

The Spiders seem to enjoy ruining

the previous Saturday, by a score

Phi Delts Second

This week found a little shake-
up in the standings, as the Betas
dropped more and more out of sight,
while the rampaging Phi Gams
fought themselves into the third
place slot. The beginning of the
week started off with the K. A.s
and Kappa Sigs locked in mortal
combat, the result of which was
a tie. Both teams came out with
two first downs, and the playoff
had to be postponed as: it’ soon be-
came too dark.

S.A.E.s and Phi Gams Hot

While the above two traditional
rivals were beating each other’s
brains out, the S. A. E.s jumped
into the winning column by taking
the Betas with two touchdowns and
a safety, to win 14-6. This put
the S. A. E.s in a two-way tie for
fifth place with the S. P. E.s. Hold-
ing down the fourth place slot are
ithe Betas and the Kappa Sigs, each
with four wins and three defeats.

The Phi Gams, getting started
slowly at the beginning of the
season, came up last week to upset
the Phi Delts 14-0, and then went
on to ease out the Pi Kapps in a
6-0 decision.

Still to hit the win column are

the Independents and the Pikas.
The Independents bowed to the
K. A.s last week 24-6. The Pikas

were stopped-cold by the Betas in
a two. touchdown win for the sons
of Wooglin.

Season Nears End
As the season draws to a near
closing time, we find the K. A.s
with four games still to play; one

against the S. A. E.s, which had
been postponed, and a_ playoff
against the Kappa Sigs. Then they

have to take on the S. P. E.s. Their
