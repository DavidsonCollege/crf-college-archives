Thou canst not then be false to any man.

benefits, and favorable circumstances that are
ours to enjoy.

Our forefathers, after much suffering, de-
cided to proclaim the last Thursday in No-

It meant much to them: it should mean much

VESPERS ... . The musical vesper Sunday
was superb. But why can’t we have more
Vespers of this type, which are undoubtedly
beneficial to the students in many respects ?

Note: The printed program necessary in
this type of service, would add much to our
regular Vespers. They present the order of
the service, and eliminate the necessity of
stating who the visiting speaker will be for
the following Sunday.

quers organization presented one of their best
productions of recent performances last week.
More interest is being manifested in dramatics
at Davidson, due to the superior plays offered

in the past two years.

PRIORITY ... Officials of William and Mary
College had a large slab of marble built in the
side of the main building stating the numerous

fields the institution pioneered in. Davidson
likewise should erect such a tablet listing: (1)
No drinking at football games; (2) no auto-
mobiles allowed on campus; (3) first woman
supervisor of dormitories; (4) first college
to install-indirect lighting in all the dormitory
rooms; and numerous other items that can
be named,

Such an addition would be impressive to
people visiting Davidson, and would bring
these facts tp members in college.

PUBLIC SPEAKING .... Public Speaking

dents enter the ministry and law which ne-
cessitates their appearing before meetings

Sizzling Seniors ....

Several weeks ago an editorial appeared in
The Davidsonian lamenting the fact that the
seniors had been deprived of their only senior
privilege when they were required to sit in
specified seats in church. This article voiced
the sentiments of the seniors regarding this
fact but as yet nothing has'been done about it.

It is the purpose of this editorial to suggest
a compromise with the administration if they
still see it best to require the seniors to attend
the Vesper Services on Sunday nights. The
senior section in Vespers extends well back
in the auditorium, leaving only the rear seats
for the townspeople and visitors. Often they
do not realize that the better seats are re-
served for the students and take seats in the
student section only to be told by ushers
that they must sit in the back of the audi-
torium behind the students. On some occa-
sions, as last Sunday night, there is a larger.
number of visitors than usual and some of
them find it necessary to sit in the balcony.
while many of the better seats among the
student section are unoccupied.

The writer suggests that the seniors be al
lowed to sit wherever they please behind the
juniors and thus give our visitors a better
selection of seats. In this way the seniors
would be able to sit with any of their class
mates they please, and the visitors could have
better seats and save many of them the em
barrassment of being asked to sit elsewhere

The presence of the seniors could be ascer-
In the same manner
as the seniors did last year, they could sign
a statement Monday morning in chapel saying
that they had attended the Vesper Service
the evening before. If this method proved
unsatisfactory they could sign pieces of paper
during the Vesper Service and leave them in
receptacles near the door at the close of the

service,

tained in several ways.

In either of these ways the adminis-
tration could be assured that the seniors at-
tended the Vesper Service, and meanwhile the
seniors would be more satisfied than they are
now, and our visitors would be treated more
courteously.—W, H. H.

Voting...

For the past several years, the policy has
been followed of presenting plans to the Stu-
dent Body and the vote taken the same morn-
ing.

This plan has been severaly criticized as
f they Student Body do ‘not have
sufficient time to think over the problem and

members o

discuss it before the final balloting could be
taken.

Wouldn't it be a better idea to have the re-
sults recofded in a secret ballot the morning
following the presentation of the proposed
change or addition?

DEAR EDITOR:

With the growing tendency for
colleges and universities to make
football a big business, it is but
right that these athletes should re-
ceive some due compensation! The
present Graham Plan does not aid
| those who happen to have athletic

ability and cannot get through

school without financial assistance.

Do not these athletes deserve
something from the gate receipts
which they make possible? The
football athletes put in something
like 250 hours a season on their
spring practices, daily workouts,
and games. During these 250 hours
| these athletes run great risks that
are never thought of. Every year
some athletes give their lives on the
gridiron and some receive injuries,
internal or external, from which
they will never recover. Through-
out life they will carry some hah-
dicap. When these athletes go out
on the football field they never
know what fate has in store for
them.

These athletes take great physical
punishment, day after day, and
come back for more. Then, too,
they travel to take the name of
their school to greater glory. They
miss classes they have paid to at-
tend. These athletes train through-
out the season while the rest of the
students do as they please. These
are just a few things.

The athletes take all the physical
risks and punishment, do the work
that makes the gate receipts pos-
sible, and receives nothing but im-
partiality from the Graham Plan as
a “thank you.” This Graham Plan is
nothing but high pressure sales-
manship — the colleges and univer-

sities get all the gate receipts and
do nothing comparatively — some-
thing for nothing. The athletes de-
serve a break but will not get it as
long as this unjust plan is in ef-
fect. Let’s abolish the Graham
Plan!

The draft in chapel last Friday
morning almost blew the boys on
the front row out of their seats.
Train service at Davidson, it would
seem, is perking up. We had all day

and find a seat. Wouldn't it have
been better if we had been given
a little longer to our-

arisen and said, “Mr. President, I
think you have an excellent plan.
As a whole, it is a fine idea. But
I'd like a little while to think over
some of the particular conditions
therein contained.” What then?
