History 41 Class
Gets Book Refund

the publisher, the members of
Dr. Paul A. Marrotte’s History
41 class got a refund on the
price of their textbooks last
month. The $2.50 refund was
made by Professor J. T. Kim-
brough, manager of the college
bookstore.
_| The text, Europe Since Napol-
eon, is published by Knopf.

voice sent by the company to
the bookstore listed the price
of the book at $10, rather than

While Dr. Marrotte was in
New York during the Christmas
holidays at the annual conven-
tion of the American Historical
Association, he discovered that
the book price should have been
only $7.50. The publisher, ac-
‘knowledging his mistake in a
note to Kimbrough, returned

but recently they have become
less active. Since membership
in the Masquers was limited to
those who have acted in three
plays, the acquisition of new
members has been a major dif-
ficulty.

The Vagabonds were organiz-
ed this year and membership
was Offered to all who express.
ed an interest in drama. Since
one of the real problems is
finding actresses for roles, it
was decided to make the new
group one that could include
faculty members and their wives
and. townspeople.

In October after the Vaga-
bond s had presented three
plays, President Martin express-
ed a wish that they continue and
suggested that they merge with
the Masquers into one formal
organization. This suggestion
was approved by both groups.

Control of the new organiza-

tion will be unified in an exe-
cutive committee composed of
President Martin or his ap-
pointee, a director, five stud-
ents, and two faculty mem-
bers or townspeople. An ef-
fort will be made to keep the
governing board as represen-
tative a group as possible. No
more than 10 per cent of the
governing body will come
from any one social organize
tion.

The Masquers will give one

final performance in April. They |

will present “The Glass Menag-
erie’ by Tennessee Williams. It

Vagabonds Stage
Wilder's Comedy

The +Vagabonds will present
Thornton Wilder's four - act
farce, ‘Fhe Matchmaker” next
Thursday and Friday nights.
The performances will be given
in the auditorium of the Cham-
bers building and will begin at
8:15 Thursday night and 7 Fri-
day.

The play was described by di-
rector Hansford Epes as a
“dance week-end play, nothing
philosophical.” Epes also report-
ed that the Friday night per-
formance was chiefly for stud-
ents and their dates.

Mrs. Frontis Johnston will
play the matchmaker, who is a
“varicose-veined reducer, guit-
ar instructor, etc., whose main
job is chasing Dr. Sam Maloney
as well as matching up lots of
other people.”

The play also features Mrs.
Pau! Marrotte, Mrs. Ian French.
Mrs. B. D. Thompson, Mimi
Martin, and Mrs. Marjory Mur-
phy. Students playing in the
production include Neal Bush-

mitted free, but non-subscribers
