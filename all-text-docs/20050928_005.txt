enjoy Indian cuisine at P.S., the new student-run restaurant, this past Friday.

P.S. a great success

By JULIA WaRD
Staff Writer

This Friday marked the debut of P.S., the
new student-run restaurant. 42 students
enjoyed a meal unlike any other available on
the meal plan.

Entering the DuPont room, one would not
have guessed they were still in Vail
Commons. Indian-style fabrics and center-
pieces placed around the room gave it the
feel of an off-campus restaurant.

Also adding to this impression were the
five waiters, who continuously refilled water
glasses and explained what was being served
at each course. These waiters were all mem-
bers of the Curry Club, a South Asian student
organization that helped produce the event.

While the menu was predetermined and
water was. the drink for all in attendance,
nobody could complain about the variety and
abundance of food available.

About 12 cooks worked for two days to
prepare six different Indian dishes.

The starter was Aloo Pakora, a deep-fried ~

vegetable fritter, which was served with
three different sauces. Next came Indian
tomato soup, which was chunkier and spici-
er than standard tomato soup.

-The main course featured Sambaar Dal, a
blended mixture of lentils and_ spices,
Vegetable Masala, and Murgh Masala, a
chicken curry dish, all of which were served
with Basmati rice. For desert there was
Kheer, a spiced rice pudding, and Chai tea.

The menu not only catered to vegetarian
and non-vegetarian needs but also provided
for a serious change of pace from typical
Davidson fare. :

Most of the ingredients were bought

locally, so everything served seemed fresh.
The food overall could have easily passed
for that served at real Indian restaurants.

P.S. not only made it seem as if students
were going out to dinner instead of to Vail
Commons, but it served as a great cultural
exercise as well.

The commitment to an authentic Indian
menu and the involvement of the Curry Club
made the restaurant work on a level that
went beyond good food.

The inventor of this project, Matt Hassett
°07, promises that future installments of the
restaurant will continue with a. focus on
international fare. Hopefully, it will become
an enriching part of the campus.

The flaw with P.S. is that only a limited
number of students were able to attend.
Tickets. went fast this month, and if the
restaurant grows in popularity it will only
become harder to get a seat. While such an
undertaking would be hard to increase in
scale, it is too bad that it has to be limited
just to those first in line.

Luckily, student participation in running
the restaurant was not as restricted. Toward
the end of the meal, a couple of the student
chefs came by to see how people liked the
food.

They all seemed to agree that working at
the restaurant was a rewarding experience.
Students from different classes helped to put
the meal together, both for the test run of the
restaurant on.Monday and for Friday night’s
main event.

Although it may be some time before the
restaurant begins to run with any regular fre-
quency, this night of unique cuisine was one
that, with any luck, more of the student body
will be able to enjoy in the future.

Freelon enchants audience

By REID WILDMAN

Arts and Living Editor

This past Friday, Davidson was graced
with the captivating pres-
ence of jazz _ vocalist
Nnenna Freelon.

The five-time Grammy
Award nominee Freelon
gave a show called
“Blueprint of a Lady:
Sketches of Billie
Holiday.” The program
stated that the concert
“uses the lexicon of jazz
to tell a universal story of
triumph and redemption,
hope and determination,
in the jazz musical style.”

Knowing very little
about jazz myself, I was a
little intimidated by this
description of the show I
was about to see.

Surely my _— skimpy
knowledge of jazz woul
not be sufficient to fully appreciate Freelon’s
music. Yet, this was far from the case.

I was enchanted by Freelon as soon as she
appeared on stage in a bright red, sequin-
covered dress, flashing a warm, broad smile
at the audience. After that point, she could
have sung anything and I would have loved
it. But, this is not to say that her work was
not fabulous, because it was.

Freelon was easily able to convey a wide

range of emotions with her music, from a
melancholy confusion in “Eyes” to the excit-
ing, foot-stamping and hand-clapping, “All
of Me.”

These pieces were
arranged chronological-
ly, with Freelon moving
through the various
phases of Holiday’s
life.

Freelon also charmed
with her amusing per-
sonality. I was rolling
on the floor laughing
when, in between
songs, she took off her
shoes and discussed
how uncomfortable
they were before non-
chalantly tossing them
aside.

Right before _ per-
forming the last song,
Freelon informed the
audience that it would
be very “frisky” and
that she would not be responsible for any-
thing that we did after the show.

I don’t know about the rest of the audience
but, after the show, I was prepared to go
backstage and propose to the woman whose
silky voice had just mesmerized everyone in
the Duke Family Performance Hall. But,
considering that I’m still a college student, I
decided that I would restrain myself and be
content to buy her CD instead.

Where to get a condom

By JENNIFER FERNANDEZ, SAM HOTCHKISS, AND
NIKKI LINN
Health Advisors

As Health Advisors, we don’t like to flat-
ter ourselves, but we know that freshmen
come out of first semester with four memo-
rable highlights: the orientation skits, the
hall condom talks, Sexuality 101, and First
Night Down.

We'd like to share
with you our experi- gh. j
ence with the climax of
freshman year: the
Condom Talks.

The condom talks are
fun, but they’re also
important.

Most freshmen have
never been sexually
active, let alone ever
used or seen a condom,
and those with prior
sexual experience may
not know how to prop-
erly use one.

‘Condoms are 97 per-
cent effective when
correctly used and are
the only form of contra-
ception that protects against the transmission
of sexually transmitted diseases.

One cannot assume that the other person
will know how to put on a condom. Most
freshmen girls asked, “Shouldn’t guys be
responsible for putting the condom on?,” but
guys asked, “Don’t like 99
percent of females know how to put one
on?”

Perhaps the most memorable question
from our talks came from a male internation-
al student. When told the average penis
length was 5.75 inches, he raised his hand
and asked if we could please convert that to
centimeters.

We found that females were more con-

The condom is a valulable weapon against
sexually transmitted diseases.

cerned about STDs, contraception, and the
morning-after pill, but males were more curi-
ous about the best hook up locations on cam-

pus and the effectiveness of birth control.
We also had one school-spirited student
ask us, “Can we get our Wildcat Pride cards
punched if we use black and red condoms?”
Obviously, there were some questions we
didn’t even attempt to answer, like “How
many times have

a. . you had sex at
ieee . a

We Davidson? or
ios “How do you get a

freshmen girl to
sleep with you?”
Many asked, “‘Is
it weird that you
are known as the
condom guy/girl?”’
We will admit
that it is awkward
to have someone
shout ‘“‘condom
guy/girl!” from
across campus and
proceed to ask us
for condoms.
Yes, it’s no
myth; Health
Advisors carry

condoms at all times.

Even though these talks can be comical
and awkward, both Health Advisors and
Davidson students should take them very
seriously.

Statistically, 20 percent of Davidson stu-
dents have an STD, so it is very important
that everyone uses a condom when having
any type sex.

Most importantly, there must be 100 per-
cent on-going consent from both sides, and
consent cannot be given if one or both par-
ties are inebriated. es,

Remember, it’s always important to com-
municate with your partner and practice safe
sex! y
