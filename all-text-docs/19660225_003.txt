JACKSON HEIGHTS

PAGE THREE

Couples Live In Village Huts

Take three guesses where

Jackson Heights is. In New
York? Nope. In a novel by
Sinclair Lewis? Nope. Give
up?

Well, Jackson Heights is in
Davidson and it’s the home of
four married: students who af-
fectionately call it ‘“‘Cardbéard
Village.”

Jackson Heights consists of
four college-owned houses that
were built right before the war
“with material left over from

the east side of the stadium.”
Derek Lindsley, Claude Owen,
Jack Brinkerhoff, Jim Melton
and their wives live there, along
with Melton’s son, Matthew.

The houses are _Jocated on Rail-
road Street off "Griffith Street,
and for those of you who don’t
know where that is, it's about
fifty feet on the east side of the
four, college owned houses that
tracks. This makes for “‘lots
of good trains," according to
Derek Lindsley, coming through
all the time.

Five trains pass the house
every day, and three of them
come between midnight and five
in the morning. But, according
to Lindsley, “You get used to
it after awhile and you only
notice it when the vibrations
knock off a lamp shade or
something.”

The trains aren’t the ‘worst
part, though. When the Mel-
tons arrived last year, they could
see daylight through their walls:
so all of the couples have paint-
ed the houses thoroughly, “after

IFC Sets Greek Week,

Plans Faculty Visitation

The Interfraternity Council
set up tentative plans for Greek
Week, which will last from noon
on April 4 to midnight on April
8, at their meeting Monday
night.

The basic plan is to schedule
activities on Monday, . Wednes-
day, and Friday so as not to in-
terfere with individual chapter

. ‘| activities and the pledges’ study
‘| time.

A banquet in honor of all

‘|the pledges will be held in the

Union on Monday night. Invited
to it will be the pledges. the

:| pledge trainers, the IFC repre-
‘| sentatives, and the faculty ad-

visers to each fraternity.

The IFC is trying to schedule
William E. LeClerc, executive
secretary of Chi Psi fraternity,
for the chapel period on Wednes:
day. If he does not speak then,
he will speak at the banquet
Monday night.

A _A Proposal v was jas made by sev-

eral IFC representatives to re-
vive the skits by the pledge
classes on Wednesday night.
The Greek Week Committee.
however, desiring to plan a
Greek Week that would demon-
straté the positive. values of fra-
ternity membership, decided
that these skits would be a nega-
tive factor.

Friday afternoon will feature
the competition in Greek games
among the pledge clases. Stan
Brown, Sigma Phi Epsilon rep-
resentative, is in charge of the
pledge class regatta. The IFC
decided that there would be no
competition on any other pledge
class projects.

It also planned the fraternity
open houses for the faculty.
These open houses will be held
once a month, and there will be
three houses open éach time.
Letters have been sent to .all

ing the procedure. and invita

Faculty Forms Group
Featues Discussison

A new faculty discussion group
has been formed on campus to
fill the vacuum created by the
disintegration of the faculty book
club groups after the year 1963-
64.

The organization is modest in
purpose, its only ambition be-
ing the improvement of the cam-
pus intellectual climate through
interdisciplinary discussions, ac-
cording to Dr. R. E. Gift of the

‘| Economics Department.

This group was patterned aft-
er similar groups at Vanderbilt.

The first new purpose, accord-| vide interested faculty mem-

ing to Carroll, is “to diversify
our program.”

APO workers with local Boy
Scout troops and publishes the
school directory each year. It
also conducts tours of the cam-
pus for the Admissions Office,
one of its least-known activities.
Carroll hopes to continue and
enlarge these activities with the
new pledges.

Members of APO are also
planning to attend a conven-
tion of six North Carolina area
chapters at Wake Forest on
April 6.

Carroll apologized for the de- ;
lay in publishing the student di-|
rectory. ‘‘We had trouble with

the printers: they wanted too
much money.”” he stated. He

pointed out that the delay was

unavoidable, since new printers

had to be found.

Next year's directory would

. be out within the first two
months of school, he said. Ad-
vertisements are now being sold];
jin order to make certain that)!

the directory comes out on time.

On Economic Problems

Archie Davis, president of the Na-
tional Banking Association, will speak
in chapel Tuesday on some current ec-
onomic problems.

Davis began his banking career
with Wachovia, after he graduated
Phi Beta Kappa from the Univer-
sity of North Carolina. He became
the chairman of the board in 1965 and
director of the Charlotte branch of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

He has had many significant di-
rectorships in industrial companies
since then, including Western Elec-

tric Company.

Davis served as North Carolina
State Senator from 1958 to 1962. He
is now a director of the Chamber of

Commerce of the United States, presi-
dent of the Research Triangle Foun-
dation of North Carolina and a direc-

tor of the North Carolina Engineering

He is also a trustee of tne Univer-
sity of North Carolina, Salem Acad-

Speaking on “Communism in Latin America’’ to members

covering the cracks with mask-
ing tape," adds Lindsley.

Two of the houses have one
bedroom, and the other pair
have two, but since the floor
spaces are all the same, the
two bedroom houses have sort of
an arbitrary dining area—that
is—none at all. .

Besides the thin walls and
train vibrations, there are
swarms of termites. In some
places, you can press on the
walls and they'll give about a
quarter of an inch because of
termite damage.

On the bright side, however,
the houses have excelent venti-
lation. In fact, it is so good
that the hot air escapes during
the winter and lets in nice, fresh,

the windows won't close fully
helps the ‘‘ventilation" a great
deal.

One person swore that there
were so many air leaks in his
house that it snowed inside! Oth-
ers were very complimentary
of their “good neighborhood”
which swarms with local color.

Other married students, who
aren’t as lucky, rent or live in
Davidson or commute from Cor-
nelius, Mooresville or Charlotte:
There are around 22 maried stu-
dents altogether.

The one real advantage to liv-
ing in “Cardboard. Village’ is
that it is off campus as far as
college regulations are con-
cerned. Lindsley summed things
up when he said, “My house is

40 degrees air.

SANDS IS CHAIRMAN

Students Against NSA
Organize In}Meeting

The Davidson College STOP
NSA (Students To Oppose Par-
ticipation in the National Stu-
dent Association) Committee
was organized Tuesday night un-
der the chairmanship of Steve
Sands.

The Committee, a local branch
of a national committee of the

same name, was formed in
hopes of securing the withdrawal
of the Davidson Student Body
from the Asséciation.

The members, Sands, Tom
Irons, Ed Armfield, Dan Camp-
bell, Ben Cannon, Harry Mc-
Mullen, Jim McNair and David
Lewis, oppose affiliation for va-

FYR Elects Director:
MacNair Gets Post

Jim MacNair was recently

‘| elected regional director of the
-| College Council of the N. C. Fed-
-jeration of Young Republicans

at its convention in Winston-
Salem.

MacNair, a freshman at Dav-
idson, succeeds Joe Beard, also
a Davidson student, in this post.
His job will be to maintain com-
munications between the College
Council Executive Committee
and the member colleges in this
area. .

A hassle arose over the vot-
ing rights and eligibility of the
Davidson delegation to the con-
vention. Reported Joe Beard,
“The ‘Old Guard’ of the NCFYR
reduced our delegation's
strength from 12 to 7 votes.

“By denying credentials of
seven of our delegates and by
using similar subterfuges,”’ he
continued, ‘“‘the ‘Old Guard’ was
able to cut down the strength
of the College Council and en-
sure for themselves a majority
of the state group.”

The Chartotte Observer in an
article last week stated that
“the credentials committee
ruled that each college dele-
gation was entitled to five votes
but that at least five members
had to be present or the delega-
tion only had as many votes
as there were members pres-
ent.”

“They expected us to take it
lightly,”’ said Beard. ‘We were |
later informed by lawyers that.
the action against us was prob- |
ably illegal, so we are appeal-,

ing it to the National FYR.

“We don't expect the split to
last, and I think a settlement
will be forced upon the NCFYR
within a month or so,”’ conclud-
ed Beard.

Discussion
To Be Held
About Jobs

Possibilities for summer
service work for college stu-
dents will be the topic of an
informal discussion led by Rev.
Joel Underwood tonight at 7 in
the Union Lounge.

Also to be discussed are short-
term service work and work pro-
grams which last two or three
years. Work in these programs
is available in both the United
States and abroad.

Mr. Underwood will be avail-
able tomorrow for interviews.
These. interviews may be ar-
ranged through the college chap-
lain’s office.

Underwood is a native of Ten-
nessee and has studied at Duke,
Vanderbilt and Boston universi-
ties. He has worked in a num-
ber of social service and youth
work projects and recently com-
pleted a program in missfon-
ary orientation. He plans to
travel to India later this year to
work and teach.

rious reasons ranging from its
lack of service to student gov-
ernments to its misrepresenta-
tion of Davidson student opin-
ion.

The Davidson Student Body
has been affiliated with the
NSA since 1961, when the Stu-
dent Council decided upon its
own authority that Davidson
should affiliate. Previously the
student body had been a mem-
ber by virtue of the Student
Council’s membership but had
withdrawn.

In 1963, there was a referen-
dum on the Student Council ac-
tion of two years before, in
which, after full discussion and
after an extremely pro-NSA
campaign by the Student Coun-
cil under President John Spratt,
the affiliation was approved by
a small majority.

The National Student Asso-
ciation was founded in 1946 as
an association of student gov-
ernments. There is no such
thing as individual membership
in NSA as students on a given
campus are represented by vir-
tue of a school’s student gov-
ernment membership.

“NSA claims to represent the
views and aspirations of this
college and to represent a stu-
dent point of view which is the
most representative that can be
obtained by the democratic pro-
cess,’ Lewis stated. “Yet, in
the annual convention of this
year, they approved resolutions
so radical that they have gross-
ly misrepresented the majority
student opinion of the United
States.

‘Also, each year as NSA de-
votes more time to politics, it
does less and less to achieve
the major goal for which it was
supposedly organized—to serve
member schools. It has been
criticized on campus as being in-
effective, inefficient and use-
less.”

“NSA is not the answer for
schools genuinely interested in
solutions to student government
problems, nor is it the proper
place for shaping interest in na-
tional affairs," Lewis concluded.
