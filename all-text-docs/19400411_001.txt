nounced this week that plans for!
the production of the spring play
had been definitely cancelled. “Our

an-

result

This play has been popular with
amateur groups the nation over,
but, as President McIntyre said, “It
is a very difficult play to present
under the most favorable condi-
tions.” Therefore the Masquers felt
justified in discontinuing plans for
the play in face of the problems
which have arisen since last week’s
announcement of the play to be
given.

In view of the fact that
Erwin will be unable to serve as the
regular faculty advisor this spring,
the Masquers have decided to con-
centrate their efforts on reorgani-
zation of the internal affairs of the
group, with well planned: programs,
socials, etc.,. rather than plan a
three-act play. It was felt that a
program along these lines would
aid next year’s group in starting off

CUTS REVISED

Davidson's ~ Student-Faculty Rela-
tions Committee recommended to
the faculty on April 2 that cuts in
all laboratory courses and ROTC
be. increased by one, however, there
would be no change in the aNaccERIe)
number of cuts. This recommenda-
tion was discussed and passed by
the unanimous vote of the faculty.

As laboratory and military cours-
es meet from one to three hours
a week more than other classes, the
committee thought it advisable to
make this change.

This is the third action taken by
the Student-Faculty Relations Com-
mittee in regard to the reclamation
of cuts siffce the drastic reduction
in the number allowed last spring.
Faculty representatives on this
committee are Dr. C. K. Brown,
chairman; Dr. P. H. Gwynn, and
