Abstinence At Davidson
Has Often Stirred Discord

Once upon a time, the Davidson student body was overwhelmingly against
out of “Alice in Wonderland?” But it’s true—in 1926
a poll to find out the student opinion of the Vol-
stead, or Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted prohibition that year, and the vote

margin went over four to one in favor of the drys.

And how about this for a
drinking rule? In 1927, the reg-
ulation said that anyone accused
of drinking would be tried by
the Student Council, and if
found guilty, he would be re-
moved from school. However,
he had a right to appeal his
case to a higher court, which
was, of all things, the entire
student body.

All went well for a time,
but then one year the student
body picked up the bad habit
of acquitting everybody the
Student Council convicted, re-
sulting in much loss of power
and prestige by the council.
As this state of affairs left
something to be desired, the
council, under heavy pressure
from the faculty, proposed
two amendments to the con-
stitution.

The first read: “No student
shall be guilty of drinking alco-
holic liquors, being under the
influence of, or having same in
his possession on campus,” and
it was passed by the necessary
two-thirds majority vote. The
other amendment was an at-
tempt to-make ‘the senior class
rather than the student body the
appellate court for convicted

drinkers, but this motion was
soundly defeated.

The situation did not im-
prove. An editorial in a 1929
DAVIDSONIAN decried the
fact that the enforcement of
liquor abstinence on campus
by the Student Council weak-
ened an otherwise strong
liquor system at the school be-
cause apparently the Student
Council members were al-
ready troubled with their re-
sponsibility of reporting
drinking. But on the other
hand, the editorial points ovt,
if the matter is left to the
faculty, then drinking would
definitely increase.

This dilemma of whether to
strengthen the honor system or
to keep drinking at a minimum
had a real significance for the
student body at that time,
whereas this significance is gone
today. In fact, one might ask,
where is the problem?

Then in 1937 a light note was
injected into the alcohol ques-
tion when what apparently was
one of the biggest stills ever
uncovered in North Carolina
was found in Davidson quite by
accident by a sewage system in-
Stallation crew.

Chapel Conduct Deflowers
Davidson Southern Culture

The “Chape

1 Conduct’ editorial has become almost a

mainstay of the editorial page since the paper was found-
ed

1917—“‘It is not too much to
say that the Davidson student
body represents the flower of
southern culture. But with all its
virtues, there are also vices; one
of them is the attitude toward
daily chapel.”
But, in examining the arch-
ives of the publication, it can

a few of these editorials.

1917—“ . . . Men sing!”
1918—“Men who alone would
not have made such a disturb-
ance, but taking advantage of
ntimbers, kicked the benches or
tinkled watches, branded them-
selves as contemptible cowards.”
1929—“Recentiy there has
been an excess amount of hiss-
ing during the chapel hour. It
is a hurt to the pride of our
president .. . Stop the hissing!”
1934—"Hissing is one of
the most prevailing evils a-
mong Davidson students . . .
the student body expressed its
dislike of an announcement
with a rumble of feet and a
sibilant exhalation. For three
years this rotten habit has
persisted, growing worse each
year. Will it continue indef-
initely until Davidson no long-
er holds its rightful place a-
mong colleges.”
1935—“Chapei is advantage-
ous to the administration and
government of such a school as
ours. Gradual increase in mis-
hehavior during the past few
years has been protected on the
grounds that it improves school
spirit, and therefore should be
allowed to grow.
1940—“The_ three-devotional-
a-week system has been used
successfully at other schools .. .
The present six:a-week system
goes over with a few men, but
would it not be better to cut the
number of services in half?”
1945—“Along with the many
changes that the War is bring-
ing to Davidson, something
ought to be done about chapel.
How true!”

1947—“‘A_ brief devotional
should certainly be conducted,
but is it necessary to develop
the Scripture lesson to the ex-
tent of a 30-minute lecture?

1949—"Since the days of
Davidson's birth—back even
to the era during which the
great Ney roamed the Meck-
lenburg woods in search of a
quiet nook where he could de-

ing with unrelenting regular-
ity on the second page of THE
DAVIDSONIAN.

“Their theme is always the
same—the message they usually
attempt to convey is the same—
in fact, and this is one of Dav-
idson’s secret traditions herein
brought to light for the first
time—its generally the same
editorial. Each year in the
spring, the old and new editors
of THE DAVIDSONIAN meet
under the tower in the dead of
night and a sealed packet
changes hands. The seal is not
to be broken until the twenty-
third of September the follow-
ing fall—at which time and at
six-week intervals thereafter, it
is published under the heading
“Chapel Conduct.”

“Yesterday, when the packet
was opened—in a locked and
darkened room, of course—it
was discovered to our horror
that the worn manuscript was
missing. It seems that the. edit-
orial staff of Carolina’s Tar

Heel, having heard of the power-

ful effect the old and treasured
editorial exerted on the David-
son student body, had sent
agents to the Hill ith orders to
return with the priceless piece
of journalism or not a® all. In
spite of our constant vigilance,
they somehow succeeded.
Doubtlessly, the conduct at
Carolina will improve over
night.

“Now, that we have no edi-
torial to print on the David-
son students disgraceful chap-
el conduct, the only hope left
is that there will never be
need for one.”

There was need—throughout

the 1950's and even through

March 29, 1962.

While running tests on the
effectiveness of the new sew-
er system, the men were amaz-
ed at the great masses of corn
mash which would float
through the pipes every morn-
ing between 2 and 3, almost
clogging the lines. Before an
investigation could pinpoint
the exact location of the still,
however, the corn mash sud-
denly stopped flowing, and
the men could only approxi-
mate the area of the still as
being somewhere in the near
vicinity of the college.

Later that year, however, |
drinking at Davidson dances be-
came more of a problem, and
under faculty pressure, the stud-
ent body voted 285 to 88 to set
up a board of supervision for
the control of functions to see
that there would be no drinking
at Davidson dances. This board
was composed entirely of stud-
ents, and had the power to rec-
ommend a student's expulsion
from school if he were convicted
of drinking.

This recommendation would
be ruled on by the faeulty,
which had by now taken over
that responsibility from the
Student Council. Apparently the
formation of this board was the
only means of staving off a
faculty ban on organized off.
campus dances.

Surprisingly enough, the
next major change in the
drinking rule at the college
came in 196041, when the
Honor Court under Scott Lacy
realized that drinking had
reached such proportions that
the whole idea of student en-
forcement of the drinking rule
was ridiculous, and it was
placing Honor Court members
in very uncomfortable posi-
tions.

The one clause which was par-
ticularly controversial and am-
biguous was the “under the in-
fluence” part of the regulation.
Therefore, with the backing of
the Honor Court, the Student
Council presented an amend-
ment to the constitution to the
student body which deleted the
clause “under the influence of
alcoholic beverages while on
campus.” The deletion carried
by a vote of 415 to 90.

This action released the stud-
ent body from its obligation to
enforce the drinking rule and
put this responsibility entirely
on the faculty’s shoulders. Thus,
22 years later, the Davidson
student body answered the
DAVIDSONIAN editor's dilem-
ma, which had indeed complete-
ly lost its significance.

Unchanged

“There is one point u
could not be placed—the

The concept of honor has
been both basic and permanent
in Davidson life as this editorial
from THE DAVIDSONIAN of
Sept. 9, 1949 indicates. The
ideals of the system have re-
mained unchanged, only the
means of its enforcement have
varied.
Until 1958, the Student Coun-
cil was responsible for the trial
of students accused of cheating,
stealing, and lying under oath.
At this time, the student body
approved by a six to one vote
a recommendation to create the
present 12-man Honor Court
which would assume all judicial
powers held by the Council.
COUNCIL FREED
THE DAVIDSONIAN and
Student Body President John
Kuykendall were the prime
movers of this change. The pur-
pose was to free the Student
Council from duties other than
legislation, to provide trial
secrecy, and, since Honor Court
positions are permanent, to free
the Council from political pres-
sure.
The difficulties of enforce-
ment were first brought to light
in an editorial April 26, 1916.
“There are many who would
despise the thought of stealing,
who think nothing of not re-
turning a borrowed pocket
knife. The man who can slip in
and take a light from the gym.
nasium is considered more of a
hero than a thief. It will be a
smirch upon the fair name of
Davidson if such a condition is
tolerated any longer by its stu-
dents.”

THEFTS INCREASE
Prompting or referring to
texts during classroom recita-
tion and gambling in its lesser
forms (private bets on_ ball
games, matching) were the sub-

Davidson's most honored traditions, the Honor System,

nm which too much emphasis

jects of an editorial of Novem-
ber, 1926, requesting a broader
interpretation of the honor code.

The years of 1948 and 1958
each saw increases in the num-
ber of thefts reported. Thefts
in 1948 resulted in the shutdown
of a unique offshoot of the
honor code, the student store.

Established in October of
1923, the student store worked
under a self-service honor sys-
tem. The prices were marked,

and the cash box was open for |

change. Food was the main item

stocked. As an editorial from |
that time said, “Were it not for |
the honor system now in effect |
at Davidson, the store would be |
an impossibility.”
$2000 LOSS

Twenty-five years later, how-
ever, the loss of $2000 in a
three-month . period. forced the |
closing of the store. Said THE |
DAVIDSONIAN, “The honor
system used in the student store
is apparently being violated by
a fairly large group of the stud- |
ents.” A shutdown was deemed |
necessary to prevent the honor
system from being wrecked.

The current question of liber-
alization of the code has its
basis in minor discussions in the
60's. A poll of the. student body
in 1960 found that softening of
the automatic expulsion rule
was favored by a margin of 638
to 71

In recent years the Court has
devoted itself to a redefinition |
and re-interpretation of the code

hall, except at Senior speaking.”
The year 1958 saw the propos-
al of a preferential bidding
system. By this system fraterni-
ties name the men they want in
order of preference. Rushees
also rate the fraternities they
wish to join, and the IFC
matches rushee and fraternity
until each fraternity’s quota is
filled. The listing of a fraternity
by a rushee constitutes a pledge
to jain that fraternity should
he be matched with it.

if accepted by the fraterni-
ties, the system was intended
to even the size of the fra-
ternities before the move in-
to the new fraternity court.
The bigger fraternities could
better the quality of their
members while the smaller
could increase their numbers.
However the fraternities vot-

ed this system down.

Remaining virtually the same
throughout the years is the ad-
vice given to freshmen before
and during rush. An editorial of
October, 1927, is typical. To
those who will not receive a
bid, “Particularly here at Dav-
idson is the line between fra-
ternity man and Independent
searcely visible.”

To those who received bids
but did not pledge, ‘‘You are no
hero for many other men have
done the same thing.” And to
those who pledge, “To some
freshmen last Tuesday night
will be a turning point in their
lives. In most fraternities there
are two groups—men who will
do a new man good, while there
will also be men who are apt
to do him harm.”

It is up to the freshman to
choose.

HOLY LAND, 1945 — Merry makers celebrate Spring Frolics, the second dance to be held

on campus. Prior to Midwinters 1945, members of the student body were forbidden “to dance on

| the property of the Church.”

Dancing Flood Finally Came
After Prolonged Dry Spell

“We sometimes wonder
whether or not the powers
who determine whether we
dance on the campus would
oppose the dances if they
witnessed a Davidson dance
and actually sensed the high
plane upon which they are
conducted.” —THE DAV-
IDSONIAN, March 19, 1942.

Before the first dance could
be held on campus in February,
1945, students had had to con-
duct a long campaign. In 1935
an editorial in THE DAVID-
SONIAN accused the college of
“moral laissez faire” in its poli-
cy toward dancing.

The editorial claimed the
college was saying in effect,

“take your moral problem
elsewhere, settle it to suit
yourselves.” it continued,

“The only way to clean up
dances is to control them, and
they can be controlled...
at home.”

In this same month the Stud-
ent Policies Union, composed
of 80 per cent of the upperclass-
men, petitioned the trustees to
allow dancing on campus. The
Student Policies Union was or-
ganized to improve the social
conditions on campus by bend-
ing “current student opinion . . .

into reasonable channels.”

The petition pointed to the
problem of drinking at the
dances at Charlotte. “Certainly
it must be concluded that a
large proportion of those who
go to Charlotte never reach the
dance floor...”

It was also pointed out that
outsiders attended the dances—
“strange men are accompanied
by strange women and both of
unsavory character.’ However,
it was stated “We ourselves
doubt that they (Davidson stud-
ents) do invite indecent women.”

Speaking of one objection
to dancing, the petition com-
mented, “Ugly things have
been said about the motives
which a majority of Davidson
students have in asking girls
to dances,” but that only a
few instances warranted such
assertions.

A petition presented in 1931
by, among others Dean Rusk,
then president of the YMCA,
had received a negative reply
from the trustees. The students
were referred to an appeal of
the 1930 General Assembly that
quoted the Scriptural command-
ment: “Come ye out from a-
mong them and be ye separate

v

Pett
‘Sold

bars ¢

.. Touch not the unclean
thing.”

Drinking at the dances in
Charlotte became so serious in
1938 that Dean of the Students
M. E. Sentelle, issued an ultima-
tum to the students in THE
DAVIDSONIAN to “choose be-
tween Davidson dances without
intoxicating liquors or no Dav-
idson dances at all.”

Finally, in February, 1944,
THE DAVIDSONIAN could
announce that “There WILL
be dances at Davidson!’ One
professor predicted that after
the novelty wore off, the stud-
ents would go back to holding
dances in Charlotte.

Yet the next fall, THE DAV-
IDSONIAN was. editorializing
against the abolishment of
dances off campus, which had
apparently accompanied — the
permission for dances on cam-
pus. The paper pointed to a
lack of adequate facilities on
campus.

In the fall of 1949 the first
dance on campus in several
years was held in the then new
Johnston gym. With an ade-
quate place for dances now on
campus, Davidson settled in its
present routine of on-campus
dances.

You're needed... just as
father were. It's an obligation that a lot of qualified
college men have to meet...that of serving your coun-
try, when and where you are needed.

And the Air Foree needs college trained men as
officers. This is caused by the rapidly expanding tech-
nology that goes with hypersonic air and space flight.
Your four years of college have equipped you to han-
dle complex jobs. You have the potential to profit
from advanced training... then put it to work,
There are several ways to become an officer,

First there is Air Force ROTC. Another program,
relatively new, is Officer Training School. Here the
Air Force commissions certain college graduates, both
men and women, after three months’ training. The
navigator training program enables you to win a
flying rating and a commission. And, of course, there’s
the Air Force Academy.

An Air Force officer’s starting salary averages out
to about what you could expect as a civilian. First
there's your base pay. Then add on such things as
tax-free rations and quarters allowances, free medical
and dental care, retirement provision, perhaps flight
pay, and 30 days’ vacation per year. It comes to an
attractive figure. One thing more. As an officer, you
will become eligible for the Air Force Institute of
Technology. While on active duty many officers will
win graduate degrees at Air Force expense.

Why not contact your local Air Force Recruiter,
Or write to Officer Career Information, Dept.
SC15, Box 7608, Washington 4, D.C., if you
want further information about the navigator
training or Officer Training School programs.
