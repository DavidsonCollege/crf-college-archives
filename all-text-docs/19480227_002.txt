These, hoWevwer, are not the problems which

eause us most concern and it is not Our pur-

pose to discuss them at this particular time.

Last year and in years past, poor make-

up was one of the most frequently’ voiced

eritieisn f the publiedtion,. his
rs

shortcoming Was corrected to a great degnee

by being able to preyMré the proofs locally

and by the ability of Bob Phillips and his
managing editors in that particular field..

Having effectively removed this fault at
least to some extent we find ourselves still
faced avith_at least two obstacles of tre-

mendous magnitude,

(1). Many arene, and rightly so, that
much of the front page news is old news— |
that the facts contained in these articles are
common knowledse by the time that the
paper ithe of the students,
This results from two. facets: (a) formerly,
and even now to some extent, the paper-has
been prepared in Charlotte. As a Yresult. it
has been’ necessary to have all articles writ-
ten well in advance, Now, however, that the
press in the Davidson print shop has begun

reaches hands

‘

to roll we will be able to replace these out-
dated articles with up-to date: ones,_Bven
then the problems will not be solved, how-
ever. This is true because of a second e(ual-
Ty obvious Tact, (2) The vast majority of
the organizations and agencies, student and
otherwise, on the campus make no effort aty
all to supply the staff with news not known

beforehand to the students as a wliole, Al-
ost all items of this nature are presented to
the student body from the chapel platform

altho it would lead td clearer understanding

and yet to more detailed explanation were
it printed instead, OF course, we realize that
many such announcements must be made in

chapel in order that a certain group can be’

convened quickly or a certain task aecom-
plished without a loss of precious time. This
not true, however, of many announce-
ments, and those are the ones which should
to THE DAVIDSONLAN rather

than read in chapel.

Is

be given
The YMUA (and in many cases the Pan
Hellenie Council) has been one of the most
outstanding exceptions to this rule. The ‘*Y’

has, through its publicity director, Frank

Lemmon, cooperated fully with the staff,
releasing to the publication hitherto unpub-
lished and unantrounced news, It would do
much to improve THE DAVIDSONIAN if
other organizations would appoint certain
members to see to it that the activities and
plans of their groups were made known to
members of the staff, also, If the staff was
supplied each week with more than enough
material of a real ‘news value’’ there
would be an immediate improvement.

A brief glance at the masthead reveals
the second problem, THE DAVIDSONIAN
is alleged to be the student’s newspaper—
yet out of a student body of nine hundred
ud sixty men exactly forty men serve on
the editorial staff and many of them only
very infrequently: There are known to be
any men inthe student body who have had
experience on high and prep school publica-
tions who definite talent
writers. yet few of these have offered their

br possess as
services to the paper. This is particulary true
of the upper classes which are represented
on the editorial staff by.only 18 men, The
vreat need then is for more active staff
members,

Of course, no one expeets the vast ma-
jovity of the students to aetively participate.
Those who do not ean, hoavever, play their.
part. All college publications should serve as
the student bod, Through these
tediums Davidson men should, express their
ideas and opinions to the faculty and in-
directly to the alumni, We need more letters
to. the more feature articles, and
above all sii@westions to all staff members.,
as to what Should he dealt with in the edi-
torials and ti what every

the readers. :

mien

This November many of. us
will vote in national elections
for the first time. What trani-
ing have we received to pre-
pare us for this serious busi-
ness of being the soverign
rulers of the most powerful
nation on earth?

It is vitally important to get the
foundations of Christian citizenship,
to study the great problems of the
day, to learn to think independent-
ly. But unless we learn to use the
machinery of democratic govern-
ment we will be powerless to put
our opinions into effect.

Student governments vary
from those which are granted

no authority to those in many
large state universities, which
govern practically everything.
Elections are conducted in
some cases with absolutely no
campaigning, while in others
campaigning is unlimited,
modeled after our  riational,
state and local poltics. There
are advantages and disadvan-
tages to both extremes.

3ut is it necessary to go to either
extreme? Must not there be some
middle ground? How many of the

Paging the Professors .. .

“By Stan
a,
PROFESSOR WOOD

One of the first of Davidson stu-
dents to take honors work in
English was.Dr. Wood of the Eng-
lish Department, who graduated in
1935. While in college here, Dr.
Wood was active in the extra-
curricular work, especially in the
Red and Black Masquers and in
Sigma Upsilon. It was during this

undergraduate period, too, that he

became especially interested in the
school’s permitting dancing on the
cause for which he
worked energetically.

Prof. Wood catne to Davidson as
a proessor after being in the Army
for some four years.’ It was on
April t, 1942, while he was teaching
at Appalachian State Teacher’s
College, that his summons to
service as an infantry first lieu-
tenant came. During his Army
career, Dr. Wood was connected
with the 75th Division for some-
time and also served as an intelli-
gence officer After the war was
over, he served in the Army’s edu-
cational program overseas.

As chief hobby, Dr. Wood en-
joys water color painting, especial-
ly landscapes. He is also interested
in photography.

Dr. Wood believes that this is a
critical time in Davidson’s history.
It is a time when the college must
decide what sort of college it will
be, whether large or small, There
is danger in that there is a possi-
bility of sacrificing quality for
quantity. Dr. Wood does not wan't

Kennett

to see the quality sacrificed nor
does he want Davidson to haye a
change of the atmosphere of vood
fellowship which abounds.

PROFESSOR SCHENCK

Among Dr.-Schenck’s current in-
terests the Davidson College
basketball team. This is because of
his interest in all college activities,
but it is particularly due to his
playing basketball for four years
while in college here. .

After his graduation Dr Schenck
went to Union Seminary in Rich-
mond where he took his B, D, de-
gree, which he followed with a mas-
ter’s degree in theology’ at_Prince-
ton, and his Ph. D. at Yale. Prot.
Schenck’s doctorate work, ‘'The
Presbyterian Doctrine of; Children
in the Covenant,” was published by
the Yale University Press.

In observing Davidson, Dr,
Schenck sees that this school has
an opportunity and the quality of
individuals which place it in a
position to do a distinctive service
which is needed in the «vorld. to-
day.

Of great interest to Dr. Schenck,
who is a member of the Bible De-
partment, is study in Biblical
Theology, while as a_ principal
hobby, he spends leisure hours in
fishing and mountain climbing in
the mountains of Western North
Carolina.

Is

Originally from Greensboro, Dr.
Schenck is married to Betty Myers
Schenck. They have two children,
Betsy and Charles.

Operating Table —

Recent developments have added
to_a-bare cupboard of gossip, and
we find that Old Mother Hubba-
Hubba can give the dogs some
meaty bones to gnaw. Those few
who. happen to fall into reading this
column will remember that we re-
quested tidbits from our public last
week. Literally hundreds of tips
filled the mail, but they all seemed
to be headed to Winchell, Parsons
and other minor rumorators. What
we want to know is, do you or
don't you know any dirt? Let’s
have it so we can make some mud
pies to sling around.

While we are waiting for corre-
spondence, let us begin with a re-
construction of a familiar scene.
Imagine, if you can, the warm,

chummy atmosphere of THE BOO

on last Saturday. Here and there,
a few bright shinning faces stared
through the smoke. This was early
in the evening. Later, there was
smoke and less shine. (Of the
face variety, anyway). Rumored to
have been, seen are: BIG JIM,
ROBERT L., ATLANTA BOB
and others who paid hush. money,

Brought to our attention is a
little provincial tale of THE GUY
NAMED BOB who has been seen
around the camp with Caroline’and
Nancy. At one time, he was escort-
ing? two-at-once. We wonder what
the story is on this, and whether
we should take the advise of one
better informed in. such matters,
and call this a gang. — —. By the
by, OUR OWN BOB hasn’t been
the only-one-seen-steadying it with

THE GAL CALLED

CAL, so
has the BOY FROM THE
ISLANDS.

“When It’s Springtime in the

Rockies” and in the Carolina Pied-
mont, there will be a batch of join-
ing hands, and “I do—its” being
spoken, whether at the end of a
double barrel or from love. We
have a short list of those coming
under the “I Love Love” category.
The MESSRS. SANDY CARNE-
GIE, EASY RHODES, O. G.
ALLEN and ED~ WATT have
made it plain that they intend to
say “yes” for the rest of their
lives come the next few months.
And this garden of love just comes
from ‘Doing What Comes
Natchely.” For those under age
and under obligation, there is a fine
opportunity to secure your-
selves a genuine, reproduction mar-
riage license by just putting in your
order with URGENT SAM
ERVIN, the editor of all this
sheet and the perpetrator of the
fourth estate (Paid advertisement.)

Biggest belly. laugh comes from
the antics of the two very zany
characters who will remain anon
since they have placed in. the
Sharpshooter class in -handling
blunderbusses. (The Army calls
these blunderbusses pieces, and it
is necessary for every soldier’ to
have his before he is ready
for combat.) Getting ahead of
