Composer Babbitt premieres piece at weekend festival

By Carrie Blackburn

The culmination of many
months of hard work resulted in
the Milton Babbitt music festival
this past weekend.

Milton Babbitt, a composer in
Davidson’s music history textbook,
has been called the greatest living
Americancomposer. Many David-
sonians combined efforts to col-
lect around $10,000 for the event.

Music Professor Dr. Mauro
Botelho feels that “getting this is a
major coup for Davidson.”

Although having Milton Bab-
bitt speak is enough of an honor,
the Brentano String-Quartet chose
Davidson for the world-premiere
of Babbitt’s String Quartet No. 6.

As a pioneer in the world of
music, Milton Babbitt has empha-
sized a more rational approach
which realigned much of the west-
ern musical tradition and inspired
two generations of composers.

He also helped “give the com-
poser and the theorist a position of
respectability within the univer-
sity,” adds Botelho. Babbitt taught
at Princeton University for 33 years
where he established a real rapport
with students.

Despite the many other acco-
lades heaped on Babbitt, “it’s go-

ing to be his music that is going to _

be his legacy,” predicts Botelho,
who also feels Babbitt is “the most
important American composer
alive.”

The pooled efforts and re-
sources of the Music Department,
the Friends of the Arts at Davidson,
the Davidson College Concert Se-
ries and the College Union enticed
world-renowned musicians to
come. Apparently, Babbitt, an in-
fluential composer, still agreed to
appear at Davidson for much less
than he really deserves because of
his love of students.

Student Government barely passes resolution calling for coed frosh housing

By Mandy Curtis.

After a heated debate within
the student government last Tues-
day, the council passed a resolu-
tion for freshman coeducational
housing.

The recommendation, written
up by junior president By Rudetl,
was accepted by the council in a
vote 18-12.

Rudell’s proposal reads: “Let
it be resolved. that, on this day,
November 16, 1993, the Student
Government Association recom-
mends the conversion of all fresh-
man dorms into coed-by-floor
housing.”

In addition, Rudell’s resolu-
tion calls for the implementation
of this plan for the next year’s

incoming freshmen, the Class of
1998.
Why the call for change?
Number one on the list of rea-
sons for implementing a new hous-
ing system for freshmen is that
“Davidson College aspires to im-

main goal behind the change,
would enable males and females
of the freshman class to form
“brother-sister” relationships be-
tween the sexes, according to
Rudell.

The written resolution claims
that “initial contact between males
and females occurs on Patterson
Court and in classrooms” which
are not environments conducive to
forming friendships.

Justifications for why coed
freshman dorms should be insti-
tuted include that: dormitory co-
habitation among freshmen has
occurred in the past; females live
in Be. ~in the summer; ail students
have access toall dorms; and nearly

lived in a coed dorm at one point or

another.

The debate in the Senate

Tuesday’s debate within the
Senate brought into light many
strong points for and against
plan. The vote was by no means a
unanimous decision, with 18 for it,
12 against and 1 abstention.

In addition, there was no con-
sistency in the way the senators
voted. Eating house representa-

After long wait, Ben & Jerry's arrives

By Susan Warren

Davidson’s own Ben and
Jerry’s opened its doors to the pub-
lic this past Wednesday.

The store is located at 202
South Main Street, one block from
the Post Office. It is open Sunday
to Thursday from noon to 10:00
p.m., and Friday and Saturday from
noon until midnight.

The Ben and Jerry’s atmo-
sphere is delightful, with cows hap-

pily grazing on the walls, remind-
ing the consumer of only the purest
ingredients in all of their ice cream.

There are many “euphoric”
flavors to choose from, including
the always popular Chocolate Chip
Cookie Dough. In addition to ice
creams, low-fat yogurt and nonfat
ices are served. Sheets containing
nutrition information can be ob-
tained on the low-fat yogurt. For

those with a heartier appetite, nuk

shakes, brownies, and a twenty
scoop sundae known as the
“Vermonster” are offered.

Owner and manager Phyllis
Schultz is very pleased with busi-
ness so far. This store is Schultz’s
third; she ownstwo Ben and Jerry’s
in Charlotte as well.

She decided to opena store in
Davidson because she “wanted to
have a store as a part of the com-
munity.” She hopes her store will
become “a gathering place for
people where they can see their
friends and have a pleasant place
to be.”

Town Administrator Leamon
Brice spoke positively about Ben
and Jerry’s arrival to Davidson,
stressing how wonderful it is “to
haveanational firm with their repu-
tation.”

The store is employing
Davidson students as well as local
residents of the town. Applica-
tions are still being accepted,
though Schultz hesitates to hire
_ college students, becausestudents
tend to leave town during the holi-

tives voted for and against the reso-
lution, as did fraternity members,
independents and BSC senators.
According to SGA president
Alden Smith, “The coed dorms

would improve gender relations
without threatening the solidarity
of the freshman hall.” He contin-

More than 25 acres of college-owned property on Griffith
Street will become retail, commercial, and residential.

By Katherine Hash

Davidson College hopes to
cash in on Charlotte’s movement
north by planning a new, profit-
able development—an upscale
hotel, day care center, apartments,
and retail shops. At the same
time, the college can maintain
control over its surroundings.

Over a period of years the
college has acquired over 25 acres
of land off of Griffith Street be-
tween the I-77 ramp to Statesville

College to develop I-77 lot

and Jetton Street which it in-
tends to develop into an attrac-
tive, high quality combination
of commercial, retail, and resi-
dential areas. |

For years, the college has
owned five acres in this area,
which is situated directly across
from the Exxon station on. the
way into town from the inter-
state. Until recent years, most of
