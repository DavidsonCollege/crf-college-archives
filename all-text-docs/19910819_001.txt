College Puts Final Touches on
Ambitious Summer Construction

By Walter Price

As Davidson students and fac-
ulty readied themselves for vaca-
tion last spring, the physical plant
and Residence Life offices
launched a series of ambitous
summer construction projects at
the college.

These projects have
involved all aspects of
Davidson life, from new
and renovated residence
halls torelocated admin-
istrative offices. Many
students arriving this
weekend will be wel-
comed to the sight of
construction crews hur-
rying to finish work on
the new apartment
buildings in Martin
Court and renovations
to Duke Residence Hall.

As of Thursday
morning, Richard Terry
of the Residence Life office ex-
pressed optimism for work onthese
projects being completed by the
time students arrive to move in.

“As long as we are finished by the...

18th we don’t tonsider ourselves:
late”, Terry said. According to
Terry, much of the work to be
completed is superficial installa-

tion in these residence halls. Terry
mentioned delivery andequipment
inspection delays, as well as the
fire in Belk Residence Hall, as
factors contributing to the delay
of finishing stages of the summer
construction.

The Class of 1995

By Russ Tisinger

Freshmen arrived en masse
Friday and began the weekend-,
long orientation process. They at-
tended a number of various social
and formal events designed tomake
the transition to college a little bit
easier. The freshmen class is 400
strong this year, 55% of which are
men. They come from all over the

‘country as well.

On Friday, freshmen firstsepa-
rated from parents and shuffled
through the. Union, where they

_ picked up. IDs, keys, shéets, and
other essentials. They spent the
rest of the day moving’ in, and

‘meeting their half counselors. For

the remainder of the weekend, they
attended information sessions on
the library and the honor code, met
with advisors, and attended the
activities fair. They also found
time for mixers on their halls and
‘at the Union.

The whole process of orienta-
tion, which is always a little over-
whelming, was no. different for
freshmen this year, Carey Th-
ompson of Richmond, Va., a 4th
Richardson resident, said her big-
gest fear yet was “just getting my
stuff upstairs.” Alice Felmlee of

Lynchburg, Va. shared that senti-"

ment, saying that she thought she

relocation means that Chambers
has returned to an all academic

‘building with most administrative

offices moving to Jackson Court
houses.

Two other notable changes to
the campus involved the comple-
tion of the renovation of
the new Admissions of-
fices in Grey House and
the conversion of Henry
Louis Smith House from
student housing to of-
fices for the institutional
advancement depart-
ment.

A final new
addition to the campus
is a security system in-
volving Belk, Cannon,
Richardson and Duke
Residence Halls. The
system involves the use
of cards that are issued
toeach student that allow access to

tof computer
system that “reads” the card and
unlocks the door for an individual.
Through the computer, access can
be controlled per individual card
number. Terry estimated that the
system cost somewhere in “the ball-
park of 50,000 dollars”. Terry
mentioned that if feedback on the
system is positive that plans could
be set to expand the system to the
academic buildings.

Burn in

Belk Sub-Basement

By David Thompson

At approximately 10:30 a.m.
on Tuesday, August 6,a fire erupted
in the sub-basement of Belk dor-
mitorv.

While no. injuries were re-
ported, and the fire did no struc-
tural damage to the building, sev-
eral m x
the blaze.

Sparks generated from work
being done on air conditioning
pipes: in the building apparently
fell through to the sub-basement,
igniting the mattresses in storage
below.

, Firefighters from Davidson,
Cornelius, Huntersville,and Mount
Gilead were summoned to combat
the fire, which took over two hours
to extinguish. ~

Dense smoke from the burn-
ing and smoldering mattresses
limited access to the source of the
fire. The intense heat of both the

fire and the 90+ degree weather
outside, combined with the
crowded conditions in the sub-
basement to make fighting the fire
more.difficult Several firefiohters
required treatment for heat exhaus-
tion.

Watching: medical cue

en de-
prived firefighters, Dean of Stu-

dents Will Terry commented that
the incident should serve the stu-

dents as an example of what local
fire departments have to face. “This
should make the students see how
inappropriate it is to pull false fire
alarms,” he said.”

Although cleaning crews ar-

rived Wednesday, August 7, to —

repair the smoke and water dam-
age, several students have com-
plained of an unpleasant odor per-
meating even the upper floors of
the dorms. The smell, however,
will not inhibit use of the building.

Concerned Students Question
Reliability of Campus Condoms

By David Thompson
Fornearly two years, Davidson
College has made condoms avail-
able to students through Resident
Advisorsand the First Aid boxes in
dormitory bathrooms. The policy
was enacted in order to encourage

and facilitateresponsible behavior
among sexually active students.
The condoms are distributed free
of charge to prevent unwanted
pregnancy and the spread of sexu-
ally transmitted disease.
Unfortunately, however, some

students have found the condoms
offered by the college to be inade-
quate.
Toward the end of last semes-
ter, Residence Life Director Rich-
