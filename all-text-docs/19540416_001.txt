Dr. F. W. Johnston and Dr.
W. G. McGavock have won fellow-
ships for study during the next
college year. Both were notified
this week that they are to receive
grants from the Faculty Fellow-
ship Program of the Fund for the
Advancement of Education, a part
of the Ford Foundation.

Dr. Johnston, professor of Ameri-
can History at' Davidson for the
past eighteen years, will spend a
year studying at the University of
North Carolina. His work will
center around the modern South,

course in Southern history since
the Civil War. He plans to go also
into extensive writing, reading, and

research during his year at
UN.C.
Dr. McGavock, professor of

mathematics at Davidson since
1984, will enroll in the University
of Wisconsin at Madison. He plans
to leave his chosen field in order

to study in the related field of
philosophy. His concentration for
the year will be in the field of
Philosophy of Science, involving
such courses as the purely reason-
able and nearly mathematic sym-
bolic logic.

Both Dr. Johnston and Dr. Mc-
Gavock were graduated from Da-
vidson College in 1930. Dr. Jobn-
ston took his master’s and doctor’s
degrees at Yale University, and re-
turned to Davidson in 1935 as in-
structor of history. Dr. McGavock
did his graduate work at Duke
University and Princeton Univer-
sity. He has been teaching at
Davidson since 1934.

The professors plan to leave
Davidson in late August or early
September in order to get them-
selves and their families settled
before the beginning of school. Dr.
Johnston will teach two courses
during the comming summer ses-
sion in Davidson.

LOUIS ARMSTRONG, |BETAS, ATOs, CC

KING OF JAZZ,
SET FOR DAVIDSON

By AUSTIN STRAND

Louis “Satchmo” Armstrong will
be here on May 6 in Chambers
Auditorium to give out with a few
solid beats of jazz, but no bop.

The concert by the well known
and wide traveling Satchmo is
scheduled to begin as soon as the
interfraternity sing is completed.
The doors to Chambers Auditorium
will not be opened until the sing
is completed, giving everyone an
even break on getting the best
seats.

Tickets went up from $1.75 to

‘1$2.00 yesterday and are now on

sale to the general public, although
they are still available to the stu-
dent body.

Satchmo, called the King of
Jazz, traveled to Honolulu in Feb-
ruary of 1952 where he packed
them in for two weeks.

Down Beat, one of the top jazz
magazines, devoted practically a
whole issue to Armstrong in 1950
and is quoted as saying “Louis al-
ways has a golden song to offer.”

The aging and yet sexy Tallulah
Bankhead once said, “His beauti-
ful, heart-breaking horn, his
comedy, his humor, everything
about Louis just kills me!” Grand-
mother Bankhead also said, in
Flair, “ . . . if Satchmo had never
heard of high F or if he thought
a trumpet was a minor bridge bid
or couldn't sing a note, I'd still dig
him because he is an authentically
great man embodying all of the
best human qualities and instincts
by which people should conduct
their lives.”

The independent ) newspaper,
The Chicago Enterpirse, gave their
July 4, 1952 issue to Satchmo’s
birthday. On this day. he. received
a raft of telegrams, including one
from the editor of the London
Datly Express.

The New Vork Times Magazine
wrote back in 1950 that “Louis
Armstrong's music has been shap-
ing jazz history for almost thirty
years, but he still takes time to

thought that the service was just
for students, but the entire com-
munity is urged to attend. Benches

worship center.

Rather than having a sermon,

and prayers. The congregations
from all the various churches in
the town, both Negro and white,
are especially urged to come. This

Mrs. Patton Speaks
At Sig Upsilon Meet

Sigma Upsilon, national literary
society, held its regular meeting
Monday evening, April 12, at 9:15
o’clock in the Green Room of the
College Union.

Don Mahy, president of the Blue
Pencil chapter, presided and in-
troduced the special guest for the
evening, Mrs. Frances Gray Patton
the short story writer and judge of
this year’s Vereen Bell Award.

Mrs. Patton opened her talk by
giving an account of her start in
short story writing. The first story
that she wrote, which was sold to
the Kenyon Review, took her six
weeks of intensive work and re-
vision in which she studied the
nuance of every word. She felt
that this six-week period gave her
more understanding of the
methods of writing than any like
period before or since.

Mrs. Patton then read one of her
short stories, “The Finer Things
of Life.” Following this she ex-
plained the origin of the idea, the
method, the stages of development.
and techniques of actual writing.

Following her talk, she answered
questions for about an hour on
literary agents, methods of selling
one’s writings, problems of tech-
nique, and other questions by mom-
ber of the audience. Mrs. Patton
closed by urging that every serious
writer keep a journal recording
his impressions.

Approximately 25 under-grad-

uates and faculty members were
present at the meeting.

In balloting today in chapel, Swain Loy was elected

editor of next year’s Quips and Cranks. Earlier in the week,|.

Henry Brockmann was chosen editor of The Davidsonian.

Amendments Tonight
in Special Meeting

By WATT McCAIN

Student interest continued to
mount high this week in the six
proposed amendments to the Con-
stitution, despite the fact that of-
ficial progress slowed to a con-
gressional pace.

The proposals found an increas-
ingly more prominent place in
campus conversation through the
week, although no steps have been
taken by the Student Council or
other groups since last Friday's
presentation of the petition.

Definite action will resume to-
night with a special student coun-
cil session to consider thoroughly

Myers, Ball, Gragg
Vereen Bell Winners

The 1954 Vereen Bell Award for
Creative Writing was presented in
chapel Tuesday, April 13. Making
the award was Mrs. Frances Gray
Patton, prominent short story
writer from Raleigh.

First place and a $50.00 prize
went to Fred Myers for his work,
“7 Sonnets.” Second place was
awarded to Scott Ball for a group
of poems entitled “Ghost Town
and Other Poems.” Third place
was taken by Gilbert Gragg for his
short story, “Frost On the Marsh
Grass.”

Mrs. Patton, who made the selec-
tions from among 29 entries, has
taught creative writing at Woman's
College of the University of North
Carolina and has been on the
faculty of the writers’ conference
at the University of Indiana. In
addition to being a regular con-
tributor to the “New Yorker Maga-
zine,” she has written short stories
for “Harpers,” “Ladies Home
Journal,” and other magazines.

During her speech in chapel in
which she immediately captured
her audience with her wit and
charm she talked on problenis of
the writer and the need for obser-
vation of everyday occurences. She
pointed out that the structural
soundness and development of the
papers submitted to her were dis-
tinetly, superior to what she had
observed in most amateur writing.

Vereen M. Bell was a Davidson
graduate in the class of 1932. He
died as an air combat intelligence
officer in the second battle of the
Philippine Sea. Before his death
he was the author of many stories
and two novels, one of which,
