THE MAKING OF A SCHEDULE

Next winter’s basketball schedule, which appears
below, is the most ambitious slate put together by Athle-
tic Director Dr. Tom Scott in several seasons.

Instead of playing at Johnston Gym or in Charlotte

two-thirds of the season like this year, Lefty Driesell's
Southern Conference champs will hit the road next sea-
son for 11 encounters on hostile courts.

Besides the usual conference portion, Dr. Scott has
arranged an impressive group of intersectional oppo-
nents, including Michigan, Pittsburgh, Tulane, Virginia,
St. Joseph’s and Marquette.

Dec. 1 Wake Forest Charlotte

3 Pittsburgh Charlotte

6 Furman Davidson

10 Michigan Ann Arbor

13 vMi Lexington

17. = Tulane New Orleans

20 George Washington Davidson

2-29 Charlotte Invitational
“Army, Davidson,
Fordham, Maryland

Jan. 2 Virginia Charlottesville

4 Richmond Richmond

7 Wes! Virginia Charlotte

10 The Citadel Charleston, S. C.

14 George Washington Washington

28 Wake Forest Greensboro
Feb. 1 West Virginia Charleston, W.

4 = St. Joseph’s Charlotte

7 Richmond Davidson

1 Marquette Milwaukee

14 = =William and Mary Charlotte

16 Furman Greenville

21 vi Davidson

25 The Citadel Davidson
Mer. 2-4 Southern Conference Charlotte

Tournament

The backbone of our schedule is the conference op-
position. We will play practically the same opponents in
the family again except for the deletion of East Carolina,
and the addition of games here and in Washington with
George Washington.

Dr. Scott noted, “East Carolina and William and
Mary don’t have good gyms, and a lot of people don’t
like to play there.” Davidson is one of these. W and M
is the only school besides ECC we will not visit next
year. Scott stated, “When they get their new gyms, we'll
play them there.”

Many people think we should step out of the con-
ference more often and improve our strength in the
conference by extending ourselves intersectionally. The
minimum number of conference games is ten; we will

lay 13. But since even the conference games are booked
wo summers in advance, some sort of consistency must
be maintained in meeting our conference obligations.

Another reason for the large number of conference
clashes is the fact that teams like Georgia Tech will not
play us. Nor would we want to go to Miami (Fla.) because
of the poor reputation of the officiating.

INTERSECTIONAL GAMES

Games with Wake Forest are contracted early and
occupy their usual Dec. 1 and the Saturday-after-semes-
ter-exams positions. For other games such as Marquette
and Virginia, we will be fulfilling home-and-home two
year contracts. In the cases of Michigan and Tulane, they
will return games in Charlotte in 1967-68.

Pittsburgh replaces Ohio University for a one game
series, and St. Joe will return to Charlotte again because
they make more money down here than in their Palaes-
tra doubleheaders.

PRINCIPLES OF SCHEDULING

Perhaps even more interesting than the end product
are the factors which Dr. Scott considers in determining
who, where and when to play.

As for the opponents, big-name teams and national-
ly. ranked teams are money-makers, as are Big 10, At-
lantic Coast Conference and major Eastern schools.

Games may be scheduled in Philadelphia and New
York to give potential All-Americans exposure before
the influential metropolitan press. This was the case
with Fred Hetzel in 1964-65.

Scott set up the Tulane series and next year’s game
in New Orleans because starter Bobby Lane will be an
attraction for the hometown fans and because we will
be playing in the Sugar Bowl Tournament in ’67-68.
cedes conference bookings because they are the import-
ant games from the viewpoint of the financial and pub-
licity factors involved.

Scheduling non-conference games generally pre-

_ _A third reason for playing certain teams is to build
the Davidson image in such prime recruiting areas as the
Midwest and the middle Atlantic states.

MONEY TALKS

Sites boil down to money. The team that has more
home games than road games is the team that makes
money. In our case, Charlotte is where the money is. The
five games set for the gym are against conference foes,
but the games in the Coliseum are against teams who
ought to fill the seats and make us close to $20,000 a
game except for the split with St. Joe.

Most visiting teams receive only a guarantee to cover
expenses, so that’s making nothing at all. In the South-

“ern Conference, everyone keeps their own gate receipts.

Davidson has no limit on the number of games it
may play in Charlotte, according to Scott. The student's
welfare, the coaches welfare and a profitable operation
are the prime factors in the selection of sites. For exam-
ple Driesell does not like to make trips of more than one
game’s duration, though he will go from Charlottesville
to Richmond for a game before school reconvenes after
Christmas.

When to schedule. a game has its guidelines, too.
Scott noted, “Lefty likes two days to get ready for a
game.” Also, the faculty gets into the act by giving final
approval to all athletic schedules. They usually give their
approval, but frown on such taboos as three games in one
week or games too close to exams. With regard to other
teams, Scott said, “If they want to play us, and if there’s
4 mutual date open, they will find a way to be there.”

Another game may be added to an open date Feb.
18, but this is the schedule and now all we have to do is
hang on until Lefty's Legions hit the court to play for
keeps on Dec. 1.

FACING DIFFERENT COURT, NETS

By YATES FAISON
Davidsonian Asst. Sports Editor

Little known outside the im-
mediate vicinity for. anything
but his basketball ability, Sam
“'Pinky’’ Hatcher is demonstra-
ting his prowess with the rac-
quet this season for the Wildcat
tennis team.

Coach Harry Fogleman claims
“Pinky is one of the top pros-
pects I've ever had here. If he'd
devote all his time to tennis,
he would be ranked in the South.

He has the strength and agility
that are important. Above all,
he has the desire to be as
good as he can."

Hatcher began his tennis ca-
reer at Columbus (Ga.) High
School. He says he took up ten-
nis because ‘‘it's fast and you
need every kind of athletic
ability." Asked if he prefers
tennis to basketball, Hatcher re-
plied, ‘‘Well, tennis is a little
more informal.”

Late getting started on his ten-
nis due to the conflict with the

end of the basketball season,
Hatcher says he felt fortunate
to make the top six. That is
quite a. modest approach for the
number three man on the team,
one who alternated between
first and second on Jast year's
freshman squad.

IMPROVED PLAY

Coach Fogleman cited a great
improvement in Hatcher's play.
‘He. has improved greatly on
his serve, his overhand and his
net game. He needs a little

The tennis team continued full-speed through its season as it steamrolled to
three more victories, beating Toledo, Richmond and Furman.

On Wednesday of last week,
the University of Iinois was
meeting the ‘Cats, but both
team’s early efforts were damp
ened as rain forced the cancel-
lation of the match. The ‘Cat
netlers were on their way to
victory when the rains came. ,

over the SAE’s by a home run

To ’Cats

Davidson’s basketball future
received another boost this' week
with the signing of high school
star Doug Cook to a grant-in-
aid.

Cook, a 6 foot 6, 220-pounder
was New Jersey's best high
school big man this past season.
Hailing from Ho-Ho-Kus, N. J..
Cook averaged 23.7 points per
game and hit 48 per cent. of his
field goal attempts.

Cook has been named along
with Charlie Scott and Jerry

Americans by Scholastic Maga-
zine. This field also incudes such
notables as Rick Mount of Leb.

played very well, especially
since he had such a tough op.

Monday the University of
Richmond visited the Davidson
courts and was outclassed. as
the ‘Cats romped to a 9-0 vic-

Tomorrow morning at 10:00
West Virginia will go up against
the ‘Cats. The much-improved
Mountaineers are trying to post
their fifth straight winning rec-
ord this season.

On Tuesday the ‘Cats will
leave conference competition for
a match against Appalachian
State on the Davidson courts.

One of the toughest matches
of the season will be held at
Clemson on Thursday. Fogle-
man compared it to the Rollins
match, one of Davidson's two
losses, in difficulty. He said,
“They have all scholarship boys
down there and have done well
this year. They. beat Presbyter
ian pretty badly, so we'll have
our work cut out for us.” The
‘Cats beat PC 5-4 two weeks ago.

The Davidson record with
the defeat of Furman stood at
12-2. Fogleman was especially
proud of four 9-0 victories over
Southern Conference opponents,
East Carolina, The Citadel, Rich-
‘mond and Furman.

4Hatcher Aids Tennis Hopes

more work on his backhand vol-
ley, but it's nothing to get ex-
cited about.”

Hatcher feels his extensive
work on his game during the
summer and his opportunity, by
being at Davidson, of playing
tougher competition have helped
him greatly. ,

NO PREFERENCE

Asked whether he preferred
singles or doubles, Hatcher said,
“It depends on how I’m playing
at the time and what kind of
mood I’m in. Doubles is more
aggressive, whereas, in singles,
you use a little more strategy.
Overall, though, I never prefer
one over the other for very long.

Strategy is Hatcher's biggest
problem at the present time, ac-
cording to Fogleman. “It’s a
slow process. He'll get it with
experience.”

The toughest opponent for
Hatcher is ‘‘one who really con-
centrates. all the time and wants
to win — the kind that doesn't
waste -points. Many players.
waste several points in a match.
Bill Council is the tough kind
who never wastes one.”

TOURNEYS WOULD HELP
PRESTIGE

Fogleman says. he feels Hatch-
er would definitely benefit from
playing in a lot of tournaments
this summer. "You have to let
yourself be known and exposed
throughout the area if you're
going to be recognized."

Hatcher has been almost un-
beatable this season, sporting a
10-1 singles record in his num-
ber three spot. He has added a
great deal of steadiness and
balance to the team.

Fogleman is lavish in his
praise of Hatcher. “It’s a plea-
sure to work with a nice, young,
clean-cut, good-natured Ameri-
can boy. He reminds me a lot of
tennis great Tony Trabert.”
