On the Gridiron

And‘ the Wildcats plucked the Game-
cocks’ feathers.

Once more the sub backfield turned
the trick. They found little difficulty in
sweeping South Carolina's ends.

Too bad the student body from the
Palmetto University were not present.
My—how pathetic.

Features of the Game:

Douglass’ spectacular runs from for-
ward passes. McFaden’s  off-tackle
gains. “Jitney” Sizer’s end runs. Ham-
mett’s great defensive work. Cassell’s
broken field running.

Just a word of regret and sympathy
for Bethea, who dislocated his arm in
the second half of the contest. “P. 0.”
has put up a scrapping fight in all his
performances this year, and here's
hoping he will soon recover.

On to Winston and punch the Tar

After a two weeks’ rest, the Varsity

is the last game of the season for Shep-

remainding two games are under those

this jinx?

Speaking of speeding: Tulane played

one week later, to play the U. of Fla., at
Tampa, Florida.

A fourth class of readers might be
added, and this is the class to which all
searchers of the Scriptures should be-
long, namely, the gold-pan readers—
those who read the Bible carefully and
understandingly, who sift out the dross
and the dirt, and who obtain the true
gold of the Bible that will endure life's
daily use. We ought to aim to get a
more luminous. understanding of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and to come into a
closer relation with Him, for our souls,
just like all other instruments, are con-
tinually in need of repair, and need daily
attention by Him, the Great Mechanician
of souls.

THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 12, 1920.

JUNIORS LEAD IN RACE.

(Continued from page 1)
Soph-Junior Game.

The proud ship of ‘23 struck her sub-
marine last Wednesday night in trying
to master the famous ‘22 quintet, by
drawing the short end of a 24 to 20
score. Although going down in utter
defeat, '23 played stellar ball, showing
rare flashes of form in several features
of the game. The Juniors on the other
hand put up the usual game which is a
fight to the finish. The Sophs, in the
first half, seemed to be the favorites, but
the Juniors staging a wonderful come-
back in the second half, managed to

emerge victors by four line points. The].

playing of Mauze, Crawford and Bostick
featured for the '23 aggregation, while
Captain Doubles, Ormond and Erwin put
up the best showing for the Juniors.
Bradley and Toney played well, while
Price and Cornelson delivered the goods
whenever called upon. The line-up was
as follows:

Soph. Position. Junior.
Toney --...---..------------ Doubles (8)
R. F.

Bostick -..-.---.---.- Ormond, A. C. (8)

Junior-Fresh Game.
Fighting nip and tuck from start to

finish, the rival clans of the Junior and!

Fresh classes on Monday night staged
the prettiest exhibition yet witnessed in
the inter-class basketball series. It was

a real basketball game and the play was,

fast and furious throughout. At one time
the three-year-olds would have the ad-
vantage and then their younger oppo-
nents would take the lead. Up until the
last few seconds of play the decision
was in doubt and both sides put forth
every effort to grab the bacon before
the final whistle. It seemed a certainty
that a time extension would have to be
made to play off the tie, but in the last
second or so of play Ormond succeeded
in caging the elusive sphere, and thereby
caged the game. All the other victims
of the triumphal march of '22’s quint to
the championship were on hand to cheer
the Fresh to victory, but in vain.

The Juniors took the lead at the start
and held it for the major portion of the
first half, but then the Fresh came from
behind and with a mighty rush left their
opponents in the wake. At the end of
the half, things looked black for the up-
perclassmen as the score stood at .16-11
against them. The Fresh took the lead
by the caging of a foul goal by McCon-
nell, and then, aided by this incentive,
opened a whirlwind offensive which net-
ted them three goals in quick succession.
During the initial frame the Fresh out-
played their older rivals in every stage
of the play. Their passing was better
and their guarding was well nigh im-
pregnable. Captain McConnell’s shoot-
ing and general fast work was the fea-
ture of the half in the way of individual
playing.

In the second segsion the Juniors came
back strong and could not be denied de-
spite the strenuous efforts of the Fresh
to stem the tide. They gradually even-
ed the score and then took the lead,
never to be headed. Their general play-
ing was much better, and though the
Fresh put up a game fight, they had done
their best. By desperate playing they
did even the score and threatened to win
up to the very last. The whole Junior
team played better, but the work of
Doubles and Ormond, with three and
two field goals ‘respectively, stood out a
little beyond the work of their team-
mates. When Referee Roberts blew the
final whistle, the scor registered a 25-23
victory for the Juniors. The line-up:

-”

Juniors (25) Position. Fresh (23)

Doubles (10) --.---.----------- Pitts (6)
Ormond (7) -.---.----------- Palmer (4)
Forwards
Cornelson (6) ----------- McConnell (1)
Center
Erwin (2) ....----------- McDonald (2)

Substitution: McBride for McPher-
son; scorer: Aiken, R. C.
