gladly greeted by all students.
Although the new field still has

many rocks and holes on its

in a year or s0, especially dur-
ing next summer when_ the
grass has a chance to grow.
At present the field is bare and
muddy when the weather is
wet, but everyone seems wil-
ling to overlook this since two
new fields have been provided
where._no other teams will
practice side-by-side with the

wards the freshman field also |
furnishes a natural bleacher |

These two new playing areas,
coupled with the new dormi-
