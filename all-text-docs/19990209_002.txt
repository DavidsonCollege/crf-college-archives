Davidson College professor publishes
account of the Itza Maya Conquest

By RACHEL CockRILL
College Relations

Grant D. Jones, Charles A. Dana Professor of
Anthropology at Davidson College, examines the
devastation by European forces of the Itza Maya
kingdom of Central America in 1697 in his new
book, The Conquest
of the Last Maya
Kingdom (Stanford
University Press,
1998).

The book pro-
vides the first unbi-
ased look at the
Spanish conquest of
the last highly cen-
tralized native soci-
ety in the history of
the Americas, cor-
recting ahighly criti-
cized Spanish gov-
ernment version of
events that was pub-
lished in 1701.

The Spanish
government was
criticized for brutal- | ©
izing the Itzas, and — §
its court chronicler
published a lengthy
book in 1701 justi-
fying the military
actions. But the re-
port was biased and
widely criticized by
critics of the
conquest’s brutality
in Mexico and Gua-
temala. Jones’ account of these momentous events
is the first major published work on the topic since
the time, and finally provides a modern, critical
analysis of the historical record.

The Itza Maya island capital of Nojpeten (in
present-day northern Guatemala) was captured by
Spanish troops from Yucatan on March 13, 1697,
after two years of planning. Nojpeten, with its
many temples, palaces, and thatched roof homes,
had been the political and ritual center of the more
than 50,000 Itza people. Though the Spaniards
negotiated with them in hopes of a peaceful con-
quest, the Mayas did not surrender their empire
without a fight. The Spaniards eventually sent
about 100 soldiers with artillery on a boat to attack
the island.

Though this attack killed many Itzas, the
majority, including the Maya king Kan Ek’, fled
the island prior to the Spanish offensive and were
later captured in the surrounding forests. Kan Ek’,
too, was captured and lived out his days under
house arrest in Guatemala City.

In 1704 the Itzas attempted to reclaim their
territory from the Spanish conquistadors. Though

. the rebellion exacted a bloody toll on both sides,

Spanish troops quickly gained the upper hand and
executed the accused leaders. The struggle be-
tween the Spaniards and the native Mayas for
control in this area and its surrounding forests
continued for many years, and many natives were
driven from their land
into Spanish missions,
where many were con-
verted to Christianity.

Jones first became
interested in the Mayas
in 1965 when he trav-
eled to Belize for a
graduate school field
study. “I fell in love
with the Maya people
on that trip,” he said.
“They hold wonderful
values and have a fas-
cinating and often
tragic history.”

The Conquest of the
Last Maya Kingdom,
which Jones describes
as“‘anthropological his-
tory,” is based on more
than 12 years of pri-
mary source research
that was facilitated by
fellowships and grants
from the National En-
dowment for the Hu-
manities, the American
Council of Learned So-
cieties, and the National
Science Foundation.
Jones’ work began in 1982, and included travel to
Seville, Spain, and Guatemala City to explore
archival materials pertaining to the conquest.

He hopes the book will increase understand-
ing of historical Maya society, showing that the
Mayas were active in affecting the outcome of
events. “This history of the Itzas proves that they
were capable of forging their own destiny as a
people,” says Jones.

He further explained, “Their defeat is espe-
cially notable because it was the last conquest of a
centralized native society in the history of the
Americas. The Maya had a centralized, stratified
kingdom-state with a highly defined social and
political hierarchy. No unconquered native group
in the Americas so late in colonial history could
boast a more highly structured socio-political sys-
tem than the Itzas. The book will, I hope, also offer
insights into the present-day human-rights struggles
of the Maya peoples of Guatemala and southern
Mexico,”

Jones explains that The Conquest of the Last

off. In addition to telling the history of the con-
quest and its aftermath, Jones looks at the political

Jones said the book should appeal to
Mayanists, Latin American historians, students of
Latin American history or culture, and the general
public. Jones feels that Maya history is a highly
topical subject because “they are perceived as an
exotic, interesting population that captures the
imagination.”

Though the Itza Maya suffered a population
decline of 90% following their defeat by the Span-
ish in 1697 (a result of both warfare and European
epidemic dis-
eases), Itzas still

He also examines the Itzas’ interactions with
neighboring Maya nations, making The Conquest
of the Last Maya Kingdom one of the most detailed
accounts of an independent Maya kingdom. W.
George Lovell of Queen’s University in Kingston,
Ontario, has praised Jones’ efforts. “This study
will assume the status of an enduring classic in
field of Mesoamerican studies. Superbly crafted,
it presents an original reinterpretation of the events

Jones hopes that a Spanish translation of the
book will soon follow and is planning another
book describing the Itza Maya way of life in
greater depth.

Jones received his B.A. in anthropology cum
laude from Florida State University. He then earned
his M.A. and Ph.D. from Brandeis University.
Jones taught at Hamilton College from 1968 until
coming to Davidson College in 1985. He served as
chair of the departments of anthropology and
sociology from 1985-88, 1989-91, and 1996-98.
