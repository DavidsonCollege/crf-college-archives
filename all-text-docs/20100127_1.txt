“I’m hurting,” admitted Eng-
lish Professor and Trinidad native
Dr. Brenda Flanagan. “I’m keeping
from crying. It’s very difficult to
think about what’s going on. I can
only look at the news once a day.
The images are horrible.”

On ‘Sunday, Haitian officials
announced that the government had
buried over 150,000 victims of the
7.0 magnitude earthquake that rup-
tured the Caribbean nation on Jan.
12. Of the two million residents of
Port-au-Prince, where the quake hit
hardest, 600,000 remain homeless.

Despite a swift relief response
from international organizations
and the American military, Hai-
tians still struggle to receive basic
necessities such as food and wa-
ter. In order to satisfy the needs of
these Haitians, the UN World Food
Programme has estimated a $279
million cost for food operations
and logistics from January to July,
including ready-to-eat food pack-

ages. Funding so far has amounted
to only $128 million, and food sup-
plies are running out.

Drinking water systems have
been destroyed, making clean wa-
ter allocation a priority for aid
workers. Without water, disease
spreads through the masses of dis-
placed Haitians. Long lines stretch
from NGO headquarters and water
trucks, where each Haitian receives
several gallons of water.

“You can give someone water,”
Flanagan said. “But what about the
grief that person suffers?”

According to the UN’s Human
Development Index, an indicator of
social and economic growth, Haiti
ranks 146 out of 177 countries.
Still bound by their history of colo-
nialism, Haitians have suffered un-
der a cycle of military dictatorships
and government upheavals.

“We have a very long, very
intimate, relationship with Haiti,”
Flanagan, who has visited Haiti on
numerous occasions and has taken
students to work at Haitian clinics,
said. “We’re not entirely respon-

_

sible for the economic degradation
of the country, but a great deal of it
rests on our shoulders.”

“It’s a corrupt system in the first
place,” she continued. “You pay
people off to get water, to get pipes
connected. Colonialism didn’t build
an infrastructure in [the] country.”

Yet despite their hardships,
Flanagan praised the “resiliency” of
Haitians. “They are warm, friendly
and engaging and giving and kind
and generous, and they’ve been
treated terribly by their govern-
ment, and they’ ve been treated ter-
ribly over the years by our Ameri-
can government,” she said.

Flanagan said that she sympa-
thizes with Haiti’s plight. “They’ ve
been beaten down so often, but
they have a generosity of spirit,”
she said. “Haitians are wonderfully
giving people.”

A Red Cross ‘volunteer dur-
ing the Hurricane Katrina disas-
ter, Flanagan will go to Haiti over
spring break to delivery toiletries.

“T can only do a small amount,”
she said, “because I’m taking this

myself. If everything works out,
I’m going to be taking down a few
boxes and suitcases, whatever I can
cram full.”

Davidson students, working
with the Community Service office,
have also coordinated to provide re-
lief. On Monday in the 900 Room,
students met for the second time to
discuss ideas for fundraising events
and campus awareness. Through
coordinated efforts between multi-
ple student organizations, the relief
effort aims “to maximize our im-
pact and not duplicate effort,” ac-
cording to Assistant Dean for Com-
munity Service Stacey Riemer.

Fundraising tables set up in the
Union last week raised over $2,600,
and the relief effort intends to raise
more.

This Monday and Tuesday, Phi
Delta Theta will host “Helping
Hands for Haiti” from 7-11 p.m.
Students may donate $10 to sign up
at their table this week in the Union

Library thefts prompt investigation, precautions

KELty WILSON
Staff Writer

In the past several weeks there
have been reports of stolen text-
books from the E.H. Little Library.
The initial incident occurred just
before Winter Break, and since
then, three additional thefts have
been reported to campus police.

Three of the stolen books are
the same: an Intermediate Account-
ing textbook, but beyond that detail,
there have been no other patterns
to the thefts, including the area of
the library where the incidents oc-
curred or the time of day.

Some of the books were taken
from study carrels, and one was
taken from near the reference desk
area. “The person had left the book
for only a couple of minutes,” ex-
plained Chief of Campus Police
Fountain Walker. “They had stepped
away, and when they came back it
was gone, which makes me think
that it is somebody who blends in
pretty well because the staff here is
very familiar with people who are
not college students or faculty.”

Although he noted, ‘“We’re
pretty sure it’s somebody college-
aged,” Walker was unsure about
whether he thought it was someone
affiliated with Davidson College.
“Jt could be anybody. It could be
someone from another campus. If
it’s a book that is very costly, which
these are at $230 a piece, a whole-
sale back to the company could get
you 75 percent of that money back
in your own pocket. So how much

money does it take for someone to
take advantage of an honor code
that has defined a school? You’re
talking about almost $1,000 right
now.

“This is kind of a new twist for
us because there are a lot of inde-
pendent dealers of books, and we
have a couple of students on cam-
pus who are actually independent
dealers of books,” he continued.
“So they could in fact be working
for an online company and don’t
realize that someone could bring
them a book that may have been
stolen. We’re trying to find out who
the independent dealers on this
campus are because any type of
selling that could be in competition
with the Bookstore is prohibited.
They may not realize that there’s a
tule like that on campus.”

The library is working closely
with campus police to implement a
variety of surveillance methods in
order to prevent future thefts.

“We have posted signs to make
students aware of the thefts,” said
Library Director Jill Gremmels.
Gremmels further advises, “As the
signs say, ‘If it matters, take it with
you.”

Gremmels also encouraged stu-
dents to make use of the recently
installed lockers in the library.

“We bought 18 of them to see
how students would use them, and
some students are using them regu-
larly,” she said. “Because we have
so few lockers, they have not been
available for long-term use, but
they could be if that would be a
useful service.

“I'd love to get some feedback
from students on this,” she contin-
ued. “Many libraries provide lock-
ers for a semester or an academic
year, giving students a secure place
to store their things instead of haul-
ing them around campus. Should
we do that? I hope students will let
me know what they think.”

In terms of the thefts that have
already taken place, campus police
is conducting a full-scale investiga-
tion. They are involving other Da-
vidson staff members and commu-
nicating with other colleges to try

to learn if these thefts may be part
of a larger theft ring.

Walker noted that UNC-Char-
lotte has had entire shipments —
thousands of books — stolen, a type
of activity he referred to as “book
pawning.”

“For students working in the li-
brary, if they see somebody they’re
not accustomed to seeing who is ri-
fling through stuff, they should go
ahead and let the staff know imme-
diately,” he advised. “As a commu-
nity we need to be paying attention

Astronaut visits campus

Marshburn ’82 will recount his experienc-
es aboard the International Space Station

Kesey Littey AND CAROLINE Woop
News Editors

Tonight, January 27, Thomas
Marshburn ’82 will speak about
his experiences on the International
Space Station this summer. Marsh-
burn, a crew member of the Space
Shuttle Endeavor, spent two weeks
on his mission to the Station.

Marshburn was born in States-
ville, NC. After attending high
school in Georgia, he graduated
from Davidson in 1982 as a physics
major before getting his Masters in
engineering physics at UVa. He also
holds a doctorate from Wake Forest
and a Masters in medical science
from the University of Texas Medi-

cal Branch.

After working as an emergency
physician for a number of years,
Marshburn joined NASA in Russia
as a flight surgeon, developing pro-
grams for other flight surgeons and
supporting the International Space
Station’s (ISS) medical system. In
the summer of 2009, Marshburn
participated in a spaceflight to the
ISS, a trip during which he logged
almost 19 hours of spacewalks, ac-
cording to NASA.

The lecture will take place at
7:30 p.m. in Duke Family Perfor-
mance Hall. Tickets are free and
open to the public. 100 tickets will
be made available on a first come,
first server basis at 6:30 p.m.
