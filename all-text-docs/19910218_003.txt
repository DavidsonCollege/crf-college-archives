what we need for the future of our
athletics is a sense of stability and
belonging. AndI’m notsure thata
pilgrimage from conference to
conference provides us with that
sort of stability.

Davidsonian: Has it been a worry
that the Big South is not as aca-
demically on the same level as
Davidson? The thought ofa south-
ern Ivy league is appealing with
schools like Washington and Lee,
William and Mary, Emory, and
others.

Kuykendall: 1 think it would al-
ways be attractive toa have a natu-
ral collegiality, but you have to
look at the schools you’ve men-
tioned and others like Furman, and
note that they are all at different
places athletically. Theoretically,
what you say has great cogency.
Practically, what happens is that
institutional interests seem to
dominate over any kind of alle-
giance to a confederation. It’s an
ideal that probably isn’t practical
at this point.

Student Body Expansion
Davidsonian: There are rumors
that Davidson is expanding its
student body to 1600. Could you
discuss this and some of your other
major aims you have for the col-
lege’s future?

Kuyendallk: \tshouldn’tbe at the
level of rumor or hearsay because
it’s a policy based on a task force
comprised of faculty, administra-
tors, and others who worked care-
fully for abouta year and produced
areport,recommending to the Trus-
tees gradual growth in the decade
of the nineties from 1400 to 1600.
Basically, this reflected in a pat-
_tern that had been going on in the
college in previous years: about
twenty people a year up to 1600,
presuming that we have suitable
applicants for admission.so that
we do notlower standards. Insofar
as we had adequate facilities to

take care of that number thus -

means, in addition to the general
use facilities we need to be sure we
have enough housing and other
basic space.

' So it’s a studied decision. It’s
not one that can be plotted with

absolute accuracy. What seems to ~

have transpired in the last couple
of years is that we’re getting a
certain amount of fluctuation in
those areas. ;

At any rate, next year we’re
looking at 1440-50 which would
put us at 1600 by the end of the
decade.

Finance and Faculty
Davidsonian: What about some
other aims of the college?
Kuykendall: One that’ $ on my
mind right now is : the provision of
an adequate financial base for
Davidson’s future. The Campaign
for Davidson has init roughly two
dollars of endowment for every
dollar spent on capital funding
projects. One of the few areas in
which we do not compare well
with our peer institutions in the
national liberal arts category is in
the matterof financial support. We
are not as expensive as many of

them in terms of tuition and fees--
hard for Davidson students to be-
lieve, I’m sure. But at the same
time we don’t have the endow-
ment base that many of them have
to undergird a well-balanced
budget year-by-year. I hope the
Campaign will do something to
alleviate this.

We also have concerns about
recruitment, recruitment of stu-
dents in a time when the demo-
graphic pattern is in a negative
direction for the next three or four
years. And in a time when the
South is being discovered as a
hunting ground for institutions
from other parts of the country
who are in regional population
declines of their own. Thus they
look to the area from which
Davidson has traditionally drawn
most of its students as an area to
which they can now come and at-
tract some good
students, too.

Recruitment
of faculty mem-
bers is also a ma-
jor concern in a
time in which we
are told that the
demographic pat-
tern once, again is
a negative one
because the teach-
ers whocame into
higher education
America in the
immediate  post-
World-War-II pe-
riod are now ap-
proaching retire-
ment years. Also,
because there was
a glut on the mar-
ket ten years ago,
teaching was not
an attractive op-
tion for younger
people graduating.
from college seek-
ing their life’s
career, sO we’ve
gota little bit ofa
gap there. ‘The
same thing is true
for administra-,
tors. Allthe time
you’re looking for sensitivity and
skills, not just somebody who
comes in to do certain job--just
that job--that they might just as
well be doing at another institu-
tion:

Minorities
Davidsonian: An article recently
suggested that there be more black
students recruited on campus as
wellas faculty. What do you envi-
sionas far as minority recruitments
here?

Kuykendall: Well, I was inter-
ested in the article because this has
been a major concern of ours and
we've tried a majority of ap-
proaches. There is obviously only
limited gratification in the fact that
we’ ve held our ground; the disap-
pointmentis that we haven’ ‘tgained
ground, It is our intention to con-
tinue to have a person on the
admissions staff with primary re-
sponsibility for the recruitment of
minority students. The painful
thing for us is that we’re in such'an
intense competitive environment
that we're really not seeing much

" growth there.

Truth to tell, we’ve probably
done a little better than in most

recent years in the area of recruit-
ment of minority faculty, and I
would argue we have a very solid
base in terms of diversity and ade-
quate preparation for the minority
students whoare here. The kind of
thing we have done in Love of
Learning accrues to our benefit. It
demonstrates our seriousness about
being a school which is viewed as
a viable option for minority stu-
dents in~ the--Charlotte-Meck-
lenburg area and from elsewhere
who’ ve heard of what we’re doing.

Sowe shall continue to do what
we’re doing and try to do it a little
bit better and certainly if appropri-
ate new methods occur we’ll try
them, too. I think the college has
been more aggressive about this
than the results demonstrate.

Personal
Davidsonian: What differences

do you see here now from when
you were a freshman here?

Kuykendall: Oh gosh. Let me
start with the insularity of Davidson
when I wasa student. It’s gone. In

terms of the community itself we.

are now nearly suburban Charlotte,

‘and we néed to acknowledge all of

the benefits and potential liabili-
ties that that may bring for us. We
are also part of the larger world in
a way which was not evident to
Davidson students in the Fifties.
Icite an example frequently of
afriend who went JYA on his own
and paid the price by having to stay
the equivalent ofan extra semester
at Davidson in order to finish his
work. In part, this was because
Davidson just didn’t know how to
deal with what he’d been doing in

‘this other setting. It was not en-

couraged though it was not
necessarily discouraged.

The interpenetration of this
institution with its environment is
quite ‘different than it was thirty
years ago, and I said interpenetra-
tion intentionally because I think it
goes the other way, too: Davidson,
was largely a well-kept secret thirty
years ago. It was a time when
Davidson graduates were wel-

comed into the best medical schools
and law schools in the country, but
it was not a time when Davidson
was a household word. That’s not
to say we are that today throughout
the country, and I’m reluctant to
push too hard on that point. I think
it’s far better to have people speak
well of you because of what they
know of you than for you to go out
and speak well of yourself and
hope-somebody’s going to hear it
and believe it.

This sort of reputation is not
something you go looking for; it
has happened to Davidson in a
very natural way because of such
things as the excellence of our
faculty--we’ve had six faculty
members be Case Award winners,
five while they were teaching at
Davidson. In addition, the stu-
dents havea good reputation while
they’re students and continue that
asalumnae. And
I think we’re
going to con-
tinue to have that
kind of visibility
within the region
and in thenation.
This has really
broughtachange
to Davidson that
I never would
have predicted
from the vantage
of thirty years
ago.
Anotherchange

was the decision
to move to co-

education when
Davidson did it,
in the way
Davidson did it.
Inretrospect, this
isone ofthe most
prudent things

in the life of this
college. It’s
been good for
Davidson, justas
it’s been good for
the community
of higher educa-
tion. Among the
few remaining
single sex institutions, it seems to
me that many have waited too long
and have done themselves some
harm by persisting in being single-
sex institutions.

Davidsonian: How -would you
describe your own significance?

Kuykendall: 1 don’t think any in-
dividual in a community like this
should be presumptuous about the
difference his or her presence
makes. It’snotonly unseemly, it’s
probably impossible to do. I have
acertain tenure in this job, which I
hope will be determined jointly by
myself and the trustees of the col-
lege and other interested constitu-
encies. But however that goes, my
vocation is deeper and broader than
simply this job, and I think that’s
true about everybody else at
Davidson. There’s a certain hu-
man vocation that doesn’t neces-
sarily depend on whether or not
you hold this or that title. I have
this job in trust from people who’ve

gone before, and I’ll pass it on to
somebody else who comes after-

ward. I said when I took. it that the
place does so well on its own I
hopeI don’t messitup! That’s still
what I hope for.

that’s happened |

Persian Gulf
Davidsonian: | guess we should
ask the question everybody’s
probably curious to know your
opinion about: what is your per-
spective on the Persian Gulf?
Kuykendall: | deeply grieve that
we’re at war. I am increasingly
sensitive to people at Davidson
with various opinions about why
and why not. I donot believe there
is a simple equation between the
war that is and the wars that were,
but at an important time in my life,
I was a campus minister with re-
sponsibilities for counseling young
men who were looking for alterna-
tives to being drafted, some of
which were legal, some of which
were not. At the same time I was
engaged in visiting those who were
bercaved, and indeed even going
to break the news to some who'd
lost loved ones in Vietnam. I feel
in my spirit the agony that was this
nation’s; therefore, anything I say
about the Persian-Gulf must be
read through the lenscs of that kind
of vision and experience I had for
five years of my life.

I hope that the cynical inter-
pretation of this war--that it is one

‘ being fought merely for economic

principles--is incorrect. I fear that
it is a part of. the explanation,
though; and to the extent that it is,
we necd to do some soul-searching
as anation, My sense right now is
that there are other much larger

qucstions involved that will con-
tinue as we go further into this. It

becomes cxtremcly personal tome
on three counts: the first is obvi-
ously as a parent of military aged
sons. The second is as one who is
a friend to a number of people
who’ve actually gone to war--
graduates and others. The third is
a very pragmatic one, and I hate to
even mention it, but there’s no-
body around here who’s ever tried
to run a college under wartime
circumstances.

Nobody on the current staff of
Davidson was working here in
position of ‘responsibility when
December 7, 1941, came, for ex-
ample.

So one of the things that has
been preying on my mind is: What
impact does this have on this insti-
tution? What if, for example, the
draft were reinstated and age
twenty was the target age as has
been indicated in some reports? A
major portion of the sophomore
class would be out of Davidson.
Gone immediately. How do you
cope with those sorts of things? So
Jamconcerned, and this is aselfish
concern, about the balance and
stability of this institution under
these sorts of circumstances. Still,
our major concern is what the na-
tion itself and the individuals in-
volved in combat will do.

All of us have become CNN
junkies; that to me has become one
of the peripheral phenomena of
this whole thing--the way in which
the media have been so focal to the
war itself.

I think the next stage, what-
ever itis, should be fearsome to all
of us justin terms of what implica-
tions there are to civilization.
