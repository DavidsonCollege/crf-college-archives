The Davidsonian

Union Café proposes allowing late-night employees to drink

Union Café employees have
been complaining of mistreatment
by drunken students during their
late evening shifts. Some have sug-
gested a pay increase
for nighttime managers
to compensate for hav-
ing to deal with inebri-
ated customers. Others,
however, propose a dif-
ferent theory: Let them
drink beer.

Advocates for the
proposal, headed by
Mark Lee ’08, suggest
that the Union enact a
new policy that pays
evening workers four
beers per hour in addi-
tion to their regular
salary. This untaxed
alcohol stipend should
provide just the buzz
necessary to facilitate a healthy
work environment, they said.

Lee says the only reasonable
solution to an alcohol-induced
problem is an alcohol-induced
response.

“For the most part, Davidson
students are a courteous, friendly
and compassionate bunch,” said
Lee. “Unfortunately, this same
group of cheerful undergraduates
by day becomes an intolerable
throng of khakied menaces by

night. They consume cheap alcohol
like a vampire does blood and
devour quesadillas like a zombie
does brains.”

Confrontations such as these between students and cafe
employees has led to the ‘Let them drink beer’ proposal

Scientific studies show that a
worker’s response to a drunken
customer tends to be less dramatic
as their own alcohol intake
increases. The alcohol has a ten-
dency to smooth tensions that may
otherwise arise if the employee
were sober.

Melissa Hernandez of the UCLA
School of Inebriated Response
explained this phenomenon.

“The problematic communica-
tion barrier that alcohol erects

between the irresponsibly drunken
consumer and the frightened and
disgusted Union Café worker is not
uncommon,” said Hernandez. “But
we have found that a
drunken worker can
offset this unfavor-
able relationship. The
employee that was
once insulted by the
sight of a pants-less
sophomore demand-
ing more sour cream
for his quesadilla will
now be too drunk to
- take offense. Most
inebriated workers
will either provide
the student with the
requested sour cream
or angrily demand
that the student get
out of their. apart-
ment.”

Supporters claim that the pro-
posal will not only make student-
worker interactions more enjoy-
able, but that they will also provide
a bit of retributive justice for the
Union Café staff. They say it would
be delicious irony to watch an out-
of-control undergrad’s screams for
a slice of pizza be answered by a
Café worker handing that student
a buttered apple and demanding to
be paid in stamps.

While the Café’s labor organiza-
tion, the Union Union, is in favor
of the late night alcohol proposal
for workers, management is less
enthusiastic.

“I’m just not sure we’re all com-
fortable with a scenario in which
both parties involved may be too
drunk to complete basic transac-
tions,” said Union Café owner,
Mitch Robinson. “Orders are con-
stantly mishandled or misread
when both parties are sober. What
will happen when alcohol enters
the equation?”

The Union Union disagrees.

This alcohol stipend
should provide just
the buzz necessary
for a healthy work
environment.

“Come on, let us drink beer
while we work,” said Union repre-
sentative Bill Virgil.

‘The Union Café is still consider-
ing the alcohol proposal as a solu-
tion, along with alternative pay-
ment structures or simply ignoring
the problem.

Roadtripping? Wildcat basketball fans’ guide to Dayton, OH

Dayton General Store: Have a
hankerin’ for some peanuts? Or
maybe your throat is parched and
in need of a good soda pop? Be
sure to stop by the Dayton General
Store, one of the oldest buildings
in Dayton. In addition to conven-
ience food items, the store also
carries a wide variety of novelty
magic tricks and some of those
games where you have to move
pegs around. The General Store is
located adjacent to the BP gas sta-
tion.

Cox Arboretum and Gardens
MetroPark: The MetroPark is
where most Dayton residents hang
out and walk around when there is
nothing else to do. You'll find the
walking trails in the Arboretum
well-beaten and very pleasant,
especially in the spring. There are

also numerous benches for sitting ©

and reading news about the rest of
the country. Good luck finding an
open seat, though!

CVS Pharmacy: While the locals
in Dayton would ask you to sup-
port the local establishments, such
as the General Store, the prices at
CVS will be hard to beat. Red and
white face paint will be 30 percent
off for the game, and there are
rumors that SGA is working on
getting the CVS in Dayton to
accept CatCards!

Dayton Metro Library: Will the
long trip to Dayton set you behind

in some of your schoolwork? Never
fear, the Dayton Metro Library is
here (in Dayton, that is). With
ample table room and an almost
complete collection of the Hardy
Boys mysteries, the Metro Library
is an ideal study location (without
that annoying green carpet!).

Boonshoft Museum of
Discovery: If you’re in the mood
for some discovery, head on over
to the Boonshoft Museum of
Discovery in downtown Dayton.
We are lucky: the museum’s most
popular exhibit to date, ‘Pictures of
Dinosaur Fossils from Other
Museums,’ will be leaving after
this week, so be sure to visit it
while you can.

Bennigans: For four-star food
with service to match, Bennigans is
the place to eat during your stay in
Dayton. They even have a diverse
dessert menu and domestic beers
on tap. Be sure to get there early,
though. They don’t take reserva-
tions, and Bennigans is easily the
hottest restaurant in town!

Aviation Hall of Fame:
Although the Wright brothers test-
ed and flew their first planes in
North Carolina, they were original-
ly from Dayton! Since this makes
Dayton the logical ‘Birthplace of
Aviation,’ the city has the most
important two-room aviation
museum in the country. Be sure to

visit their newest exhibit, ‘Pillows ©

the Wright Brothers Once Slept
Upon.’

Dayton Municipal Coliseum:
Easily the largest structure in all of
Dayton, the Coliseum is where all
the action will be happening this
week. Although it hasn’t been ren-

ovated since it was built in 1967,

the Coliseum still easily passes

most safety regulations and offers

a variety of food and merchandise |
vendors. Davidson students will

find their seats in section 398 of

the upper deck behind the large

ESPN advertisement banner.
