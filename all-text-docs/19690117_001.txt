College-Church Relationship: ‘Not A Balance Sheet’

By CHARLES McEWEN
Associate Editor
The First of Three Articles
$66,529.51

That is the amount that Davidson Col-
lege received in direct support from the
Presbyterian Church, U. S., last year.

For this smali amount in relationship
to a total income of about-83 % million,
the church elects 37 of Davidson's 51
trustees, and 17 of those 37 now serving
on the board are ministers.

When dealing with Davidson's rela-
tionship with the church, however, such
figures have only a relative significance.

It is true that Davidson receives a

small amount in direct support from the
Synod of North Carolina, from the Synod
of Florida and from Asheville Presby-
tery.

Then immediately one faces the ques-
tion of how much money is given to the
college from individuals and foundations
because it is either a Presbyterian school
or a church-related school.

If one assumes the role of a devil's
advocate and consciously seeks incon
gruities in Davidson’s relationship with
the church, a larger incongruity is found
in the composition of the Board of Trus-
tees, the college’s governing body.

About a half of the men elected by the

church's presbyteries are ministers. Yet
only two men, J. McDowell Richards and
W. T. Thompson, who have served as
trustees in the last 10 years by election
by the Alumni Association, have been
ministers. There are no ministers cur-
rently serving on the board by alumni
election.

Further, in a survey of 8.544 alumni
taken in 1963-64. slightly more than one-
tenth of those men were actively engag-
ed in the church ministry, and only
684 men, still less. in the Presbyterian
ministry.

If the assumption that the governing
body of an institution should reflect the

profession. and vocation attitudes of its
graduates is a valid one, the Board of
Trustees seems to include a preponder-
ance of ministers.

Although the presbyteries elect a large
number of ministers to the board, the
Alumni Association obviously does not
elect ministers in the same proportion.

But in dealing with the relationship
of Davidson and the church, there are
many intangibles that cannot be measur-
ed by amounts of money and member-
ship in its governing body or by words.

Despite ali criticism and foment for
change. the tradition that Davidson is
a Presbyterian school. a church-related

school, ‘‘a safe place to send your son,”
is a long and cherished one. The charac-
ter of “is-ness” at Davidson is perhaps
the major reason that the status quo
on major and controversial issues is so
stoically maintained.

Incongruities aside, Davidson is still
bound to the Presbyterian Church with
an umbilical cord of piano wire, if trus-
tee opinion means anything.

The Rev. John N. Miller of Rocky
Mount, a triistee elected by Albe-
marle Presbytery, favored election of
trustees by the presbyteries and saw no
need at the present to disassociate David-

Arguments; Grant Received

Duke Endowment grant and
arguments for voluntary -
ROTC at its meeting yester.
day in Charlotte.

Members of the ‘‘Ad Hoc

for making ROTC, presently
required for most students
during the first two years,
completely voluntary.

The SGA Senate voted in
November to recommend
that ROTC be made com-

that the drop add period for
ROTC be extended to two
weeks, during which time
freshmen would undergo an

Cannon Freshmen Arrange
Basement Relaxation Area

By JOHN McLEAN
Staff Writer

Freshmen in Cannon dor-
mitory have converted a
basement storage room into
a lounge and TV room.

Conceived by dorm Senator
Stewart Rogers and approv-
ed by unanimous vote of the
dormitory members, the pro-
ject was supported by Mrs.
Peter Nichols, director of
student housing. ‘‘We had the
greatest cooperation from
Mrs. Nichols,’’ said Rogers.
“and Dr. Spencer even
wrote us a note to tell us he
thought was a good idea."

The school maintenance
crew did most of the hard
work: plastering the walls,
installing a linoleum floor,
fixing a door and window.

The dorm residents had to
clean the storage room,
which had been filled with
mattresses, and painted the
room with paint provided by
the college.

Members of Cannon dorm
will not have, to spend any
of their own money on the
project. though some stu-
dents have contributed fur-
niture and.a TV.

Rogers expressed the hope
that the college wil! finance
such projects again in the
future. He said Mrs Nichols

had said the college is plan-
ning to renovate the dorms
next year and is not eager
to donate large sums _ for
lounges at this time.

The furniture and TV for
the new Cannon lounge ar-
rived last Wednesday. Rog:
ers said that the lounge was
“just for members of Can-
non.’ but that this did not

mean other students

“couldn't ever put a foot. in’

the door.”

Once the lounge is in oper
ation, the RHA will super
vise the enforcement of
hours, rules, and damages
to private property.

The lounge will be open all
the time during weekends
and on weekday nights.

$100,000 will be committed
to increases in faculty and
staff salaries.

$80,000 will be used to buy
more library books ‘‘to help
put us on a. level with the
best college libraries and to
meet the demands of the new
curriculum for more library
materials.” A new library
building will take up another
$50,000.

Salaries for new faculty
members. particularly in the
field of non-Western studies.
will receive $35,000.

A $10,000 amount will be
used for “faculty recogni
tion and encouragement,"
specifically for special grants
to faculty members for re.
search and travel abroad.

The final $10,000 will be
for Davidson's Liberal Arts
Program for Public School
Teachers, which stresses

‘non-‘methodology courses for

teaching certificate renewal.

MEET THE CANDIDATES

A 26-year-old former Marine who terms him-
self a conservative, a constitution writer who has
gained open dorms without an open door rule,
and an IFC member who is also a hall counselor
are the three candidates for the second SGA

Presidency.

Each candidate was interviewed by the Edi-

results have been compiled and analyzed by
Editor-in-Chief Robbie Hooker, on Page 6 of

Faculty To Air Proposals

On Exams, Dorm

Proposals for self schedul-
ed examinations and for
open dormitories at David

ftems to be decided at Tues
days faculty meeting.

Dean of Faculty Frontis
W. Johnston said that the
self-scheduled exams pro-
posal will be outlined in a
letter which he will send to
the faculty prior to the
meeting. Already approved
by the faculty Educational
Policy Committee, the propos

could be put into operation

end of each term.

At the same meeting, the

Constitution will be voted
on, and will provide for open

long beseiged by opposition
from some of. the faculty
members. on the Student
Life Committee, including
Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts Jr., before the com
mittee finally reported the

proposal out.

If the Residence Hall Con
stitution is passed, it is pos
sible that dormitories be
opened for the concert

Davidson has been delayed.

CONVENTION HEADACHES

Chicago Easier?
Senate Wonders

It's about as easy to have
a convention at Davidson as
it is in Chicago, the student
Senate discovered this week.

First there were credenti
als problems: a_ red-faced
Senate discovered it had
placed a University of South
Carolina student on the con
stitutional convention, — in.
stead of a Davidson fresh
man.

A matter of mistaken
identity, it later turned out.

Slater Representatives
Hear Student Requests

By DICK ANDERSON
Asst. Managing Editor

The newly constituted stu-
dent food service committee
met Wednesday with Slater
officials and members of the
college administration to dis.
cuss future requirements for
Slater service and to present
the food service with student
requests.

The ARA Slater School and
College Services, which cat-
ers for the College Union
cafeteria. sent a delegation
headed by Clarence E. Koes
ter, general manager for the
southeastern region.

In two meetings the three
delegations discussed future
Slater commitments for the
cafeteria. a possible snack
bar and special services such
as early-morning breakfasts
on dance weekends.

Koester and Klaus Klee-
berg, resident manager of
Slater’s Davidson operation,
stressed that they could do

such special services if they
were forewarned well in ad
vance.

“No one is trying to take
away. your flexibility," Koes
ter told the committee,
which included members of
the Union Social Council and
C. Shaw Smith. director of
the College Union.

‘But if you will inform us
enough in advance, the whole
operation will reflect to your
advantage, since we will be
able to do a better job,"
Koester said.

Kleeberg also said that the
cafeteria would have a hard
time doing a good job on a
day-to day basis if he were
unable to plan in advance for
special functions.

This was in accord with
Dean Of Students Richard
C. Burts Jr.'s emphasis on
student-oriented food  ser-
vices. Burts moderated the
meeting in the absence of

was seen stopping everyone
he met between Chambers
and the post office, but he
could pick up only two fresh
men.

And so the election of the
convention which was sched-
uled.for last Friday was re.
set for yesterday.

By yesterday, the Senate

uoneers. If it finds the neces.
Sary 29 students by this
morning, then things are set
for a sequel to last October's
convention, in which changes
to adapt to the Code of Re-
sponsibility were supposedly
approved,

However, last year's fast
moving convention decided
to leave certain conflicts be.
tween its constitution and the
Code, hoping for later Code
revisions.

The Code revisions have
been made, have been ap-
proved in principle by the
faculty Student Life Com.
mittee, and will go to the
faculty and students along
with whatever constitutional
changes are adopted.

The student Senate Tues-
day failed to obtain a quo-
rum. falling seven short of
the required 16 present.

Elections Board Chairman
Frank Murphy made several
announcements to those pre-
sent about elections, and
President Joe Murphy dis-
missed the senators after
checking to see if there were
any urgent business.
