Work Hard Is Early

An example of the Wildcat ‘spirit’ cuit’ itself in the
game with N. C. State and Carolina last week. The heavi-
ly-favored Phantoms ran up against a tight Davidson
defense and barely managed to eke out a 38-30 victory
over the ’Cats. The mighty George Glamack, who has

been averaging 20 points per game was held to ll Scrimmages
points by John Belk and Don Bell and Davidson’s Jim-
