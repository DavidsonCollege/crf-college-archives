Snow, Skiing, Hot tubs, A Good Time ! all near Davidson?

By Curisty Sui

With exams on the horizon,
any article concerning the thrill of
traveling will probably fall on deaf
ears, so clip this article for the
winter months after your return to
Davidson in January 1996. The.
beginning of the semester provides
a perfect opportunity to head for
the hills on nights and weekends
for some cold weather activity.

On the Road Againj

It’s not Purgatory, CO or
Snowbird, UT or Okemo, VT, but
the skiing opportunities within rea-
sonable distance from Davidson
do provide challenges in their own
regard. Theruns are, on the whole,
fairly simple; for example, an ad-
vanced slope at one of the follow-
ing resorts may only classify as a
bluerun out west. Unlike the trends
in the northeast, there are few, if
any, tree skiing experiences to be
had. Nonetheless, a visit to the ski
mountains of Virginia, West Vir-

ginia, and North Carolina proves a
fulfilling experience.

Several factors come intocon-
sideration in choosing which slope
to visit. .

First, the weather does tend to
place restrictions; if itis too warm,
alpine skiing soon becomes water
skiing without a boat. Alternately,
if it is too cold, road conditions can
become too hazardous to attempt,
especially at the higher altitudes.

West Virginia slopes possess
higheraltitudes than those of North
Carolina and Virginia, depending
upon the individual ski resort. Un-

fortunately, these slopes are also
the furthest away. Winterplace is
the closest WV ski area to
Davidson. With three-quarters of
its runs intermediate or expert cali-
ber, Winterplace has options for
every level skier. In addition, it
also-has twilight skiing seven days
aweek. To top it off, Wintergreen
is easily accessible; simply take I-
77 North to West Virginia exit 28.
This is only about a 3.5 hour trip.
If that seems too far away, try
some of the North Carolina ski
resorts. Although further south,
these mountains usually keep the
snow blowers going strong enough
for decent skiing. One difficulty
for beginners and challenge for
intermediate skiing (something
rarely found out west) are the ice
patches often unavoidable because
of alternating warm and cold
weather at the lower altitude moun-
tains. This is only a warning; such
an obstacle does not inhibit one’s
ability tohave a goodtime. —_
Boone and its surrounding
mountain towns have several ski-
ing options. Appalachian Ski

Skier in West Virginia.

are all nestled here. Because these
are clustered within the same area,
it is wise to call and compare stu-
dent rates and special night skiing
opportunities. Rates tend to go up
on weekends, both for lift tickets
and for rentals, so any.weekday/

night skiing you can do will save
you money. Night skiing is a pos-
sibility since these mountains are
only a maximum of two hours
away. Season lift tickets are also
available.

Hawksnest, and Sugar Mountain

The Chamber Singers’deliver personal renaissance

By Jay Hupson
Guest Writer

The Davidson College Cham-
ber Singers performéd ‘their fall
concert last Wednesday evening in
the Presbyterian Church. The en-
semble consists of 19 select mem-
bers of the college Concert Choir,

18 students and one faculty mem- ©

ber. The conductor of the ensemble
is Donna Di Grazia. :
Altogether the concert in-
cluded four different choral selec-
tions and one selection for solo
organ. The singers performed ex-
clusively renaissance and baroque
music; composers included English
composers Thomas Weelkes and
William Byrd, and German com-
posers Johann Sebastian Bach and
George Frideric Handel. Both
Weelkes and Byrd are renaissance
composers, living in the 16th and
17th centuries. Bach ‘and Handel

are baroque composers, living the
majority of their lives in the. 18th
century.

The first two pieces on the
program were Hosanna to the Son
of David by Thomas Weelkes and
Ave Verum Corpus by William
Byrd. Both of these pieces are
compositions set to sacred texts:
the first one set to a portion of the
Gospel according to St. Matthew,
the second one to a “Hymn after
the Consecration for the Feast of
Corpus Christi.”

During Hosanna to the Son of
David, the four different voice parts
intertwined together in such a way
that represented the secular En-
glish madrigal. This is not too
surprising considering that Tho-
mas Weelkes is better known as a
composer of English madrigals.
The piece by William Byrd is much
more morose in nature than the
Weelkes due mainly to “the more

solemn nature of the text.”

These two renaissance pieces
were followed up by two pieces by
J.S. Bach. The first work was for
solo organ and performed by the
accompanist and church organist
Jane Cain.

The second work provided the
highlight of the performance. The
choir performed a ten movement
piece entitled Jesu; Meine Freude,
(Jesus, My Joy) This piece is based
on Lutheran chorales as well as St.
Paul’ s epistle, and “is one of Bach’s
early triumphs in vocal music.”
Generally, the 10 movements em-
phasize rejoicing in the name and
protection of the Christian Lord.

The final work of the evening
was a bombastic piece by Handel
entitled Zadok the Priest. This
work was composed as a corona-

tion anthem for George II. The
choir performed this composition
with three trumpets and timpani.
Essentially this piece, inthe con-
text of a coronation ceremony,
praises the British king and wishes
him long life anda successful reign.
In the context of the concert, this
piece served as a good closer. It
provided a bang toend the concert.

Overall, the choir performed
extremely well. Di Grazia, in one

tor at Davidson College, has cre-
ated a flawless ensemble. The
Presbyterian Church provided just
the right acoustics for an ensemble
of this size, making the group sound
superb.

This concert represented a
semester’s worth of the group’s
practice. The singers worked hard
and succeeded in giving a magnifi-
cent performance. Great show and
congratulations to all.
