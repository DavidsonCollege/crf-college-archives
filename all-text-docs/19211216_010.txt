THE DAVIDSONIAN, DECEMBER 16, 1921.

DISCUSSION OF LABRADOR
HELD BY VOLUNTEER BAND

A very interesting program was en-
poyed by a goodly number of visitors in
addition to the regular attendance of
members at the weekly open meeting of
the Volunteer Band pundey morning at
ten o'clock.

Brief but excendinaty interesting talks
on conditions and customs in Labrador
and particularly on Dr. Winifred T.
Grenfell’s wonderful work among the
hardy fishermen of that country were
given by Harold Moss and others. Books

fell mentioned were: “Adrift on an Ice-
pan,” “Down to the Sea,” and “The Har-
vest of the Sea.”

The open meeting next Sunday morn-
ing at ten o’clock in the Y. M. C. A.
recreation room will be the last before

Christmas and it is hoped it will be the|

best meeting of the fall term. Mr. Jack-
son will speak fn Missions from the
business man’s standpoint. The coun-
try of interest to be discussed is Japan,
with the great problems concerning her
which face the world today.
an open meeting and everyone is in-

It is to be!

Woodrow Wilson As I Know Him

BY JOSEPH TUMULTY
Postpaid $5.00
THE BOOK OF THE SEASON

Mr. Tumulty’s human account of Woodrow Wilson’s administration is writ-
ten in an impartial manner; he gives the facts as he sees them and lets the reader
draw his own conclusions whether of praise or blame. He tells why Colonel
Roosevelt and Gen. Wood did not get to France, and explains how seeret Bieres
als rations for war were made by the President's order in 1916.

Remember
This
When people buy phonographs

they want music exactly as the
artists, themselves render it.

THE NEW EDISON before
more than five million people,
over five thousand times, and in
comparison with over 75 promi-
nent artists, has proved that there
is no difference between the ar-
tist’s actual singing or playing and
the Edison Re-Creation of that
performance. It is the only pho-
nograph which dares this test of
direct comparison.
