Student Bible Class
Continues This Year

Dr. Arbuckle Chosen Teacher for
the Fourth Consecutive
Year

The Student Sunday School Class,
conducted by Dr. H. B, Arbuckle at
the Davidson College Presbyterian
Church every Sunday morning at 10
o’clock, is to be continued during the
forthcoming year.

This class, which is essentially a stu-
dent proposition, each year reorgan-
izes by selecting a teacher and elect-
ing officers, This makes the fourth
consecutive year that they have chosen
Dr. Arbuckle as their teacher. A. B.
Rhodes was elected president of the
class for the year.

Dr. Arbuckle stated that about sev-
enty-five boys, a larger number than
usual, were present at the first meet-
ing of the class. Of this number, the
majority were Freshmen. All matters
except the actual teaching of the les-
son are handled through the students.
Dr. Arbuckle always makes his talks
exceedingly interesting and helpful. A

Department. It is of interest to us to
learn that Mr. Slocum is a member
of the same social fraternity as our
own director, Mr. Pfohl, and studied
and taught with him this past summer
in the University of Michigan where
both took degrees in music.

Rated as one of the outstanding pic- |
itures of the month, this picture shows'|

the mob spirit, mixed with many emo- |person who seems to be any Pisa walled

tional and many touching scenes.
Charles Bickford plays the part of a
gangster who is seen killing a peace-
ful old man by a group of students.
After his acquittal by the court, the
boys take it upon themselves to pun-
ish him, There the mob feelings are
brought in, with the mob led by Rich-
ard Cromwell. Judith Allen, as Crom-
well’s sweetheart, lures the gangster’s
right-hand man on, and the punishment
begins. The picture is carried on very
successfully by the stars, includng Ben
Alexander and Eddie Nugent.

Thursday, Sept. 28—Shanghai Madness
This picture presents a very good
cast and some very good acting, under
unusual circumstances. Spencer Tracy
along with Fay Wray fill the roles
very well, and they are ably assisted
by Ralph Morgan and Eugene Pal-
lette. The scene is laid in China, dur-
ing one of the civil wars there, and}
is quite distinctively entertaining in its
originality. There is no drag, and it
should be well worth seeing.

cordial invitation is always extended to
any students who may wish to attend.

The picture is very gay and amusing,

‘Tobaccos grown in

this country are “seasoned”

with tobaccos from
‘Turkey and Greece

THE ANSWER IS VERY SIMPLE:

OBACCOS to taste right in a

cigarette need to be

flavored or

seasoned just the same as you might
season a steak or a pudding.

No tobaccos have ever been found
that equal the spicy aromatic tobac-
cos of Turkey and Greece for this
purpose. That’s why we send 4000
miles for aromatic tobaccos from Sam-
soun and Smyrna, Xanthi and Cavalla.

When blended and cross-blended
in just the right amounts with Chest-
erfield’s mild ripe Domestic tobac-
cos, the result is a rich flavor and a

fine fragrance.

~ Chesterfields are seasoned right—

they taste right. May
you try them.
