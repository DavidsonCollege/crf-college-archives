Council To Consider
Point System Plans
Within Near Future

Student Council May Present
Plan to Student Body For
Approval

Plans for the much-discuss-
ed and long-awaited point sys-
tem will be presented to the
student council, and ultimately
to the student body if it pass-

es the governing group, in the!
near future, it was learned
trom an authoritative source

this week,

The plan to be considered is now
undergoing careful study and work
and has,as its purpose the limita-
tion the of offices
student can hold. It is felt that
the new system will to a great ex-

of number a

tent remedy the situation now pre-

valent on the Davidson campus —
the fact that a small group of men
shoulder almost the entire burden
of responsibility and work in extra
curricula activities.
