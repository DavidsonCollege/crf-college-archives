(To ROTC Rifles

Davidson came through in good
standing in the annual ROTC Na-
tional Intercollegiate Rifle Match
held last March by tying as the
third highest team in the Third
Army.

The team had five men who dis-
tinguished themselves. They were
W. W. Abbott, R. C. Garrison, A.
D. Groseclose. W. L. Morris, and
H. S. Ward. The competition was
composed of teams from the Army,
Navy, and Air Force ROTC units
all over the country, and the win-
ner was the University of San
Francisco, in California.

PROFS WIN AGAIN...

for the pair losing faculty two-
somes.

In tennis four out of five
matches were captured by the
faculty netmen. Probably the
hardest fought match was the

—— | Juhnston and McCutchan vs. Wade

and Clark duel, After'fighting hard
to overcome a 4-5 deficit in games
in the first set and finally winning,
8-6, the faculty team faded from
a 3-1 lead in the second set arid
finally lost +6. Not to be outdone,
however, they came back to grab
the last set and their match 6-4,

Other scores in the tennis
matches were: Causey and G. Mar-
tin over Coleman and Tucker, 6-4,
3-6; Stockton and Stockton over
Morton and Guerrant, 6-8, 6-4, 6-2;
Wilson and Purcell over Fitzgerald
and Shippey, 6-4, 6-4; Rice and
Baird over Murray and Warren,
6-1, 6-1.

The only bright spot for the
class of °52 came in volleyball
when they soundly trounced
the faculty 21-3 and 21-4. The
senior’s overall height proved
tco much for an apparently in-
experienced faculty team that
showed spirit, if not ability.
Playing for the seniors were Ab-

bott, Ballew, Camp, Davis, Goley,
Oglesby, Robinson, Whitfield, and
Williams; for the faculty were
Baird, Ballard, Bauman, Chandler,
Gripe, J. Martin, Rice, Spencer,
and Trakas.

On the softball diamond the
seniors saw an eight-run lead melt
before a heavy barage of hits and
a considerable number of miscues
to give the “retreads” a 13-12 vic-
tory in the eleventh inning. Boyd
Baird's grand slam homer in the
eighth tied it up, and Perry Daniels’
wild pitch allowed Lt. Col. Ballard
‘o come home with the winning tal-
ly in the fatal eleventh.

First Lt. Norman L. William-

no indications given the PMS&T
to date that any of the present
group of six enlisted men on duty
here will be replaced.

indignation which united many of
his former friends with his foes,

members of the Eumanean Literary
Society. The impeachment ended a
period of demogoguery and corrup-
tion never before envisaged on the
Davidson campus. By comparison
Tammany Hall stands out a very
saint to the corruption, putridity,
and subterfuge of Eu Hall. “Iron
Pete” and his henchmen, “Mad
Jack” Hunter, “Piedmont” David-
son, and “Rough Element” Daniel,
plotted to fertilize their seeds of
corruption with an innocent vic-
tim of thir already notorious
Kappa Kappa (KKK).

“Whereby the said ‘Iron Pete’
Kalagralsnoot is guilty of wilful
neglect of duty, incompetency, cor-
ruption in office, and of an offense
involving moral turpitude,” as
these words resounded from the
lips of the. president-elect, “Honest
Bob” Walker, Eu Hall palpitated
with shouts of “oust the usurpers,”
“Ging the Creek,” “Hungawa,” and
various other victory cries. Twenty-
two charges, running all the way
from simple malfeasance to despo-
tism and tyranny, were brought
against “Iron Pete.” It was charged
that he had given special commis-
sion to an irresponsible person (his
gunman), “Toughie Boy” Daniel.
Six separate charges of personal
‘Tgraft were made; nine charges in-
volving tyranny and desppotism
were Issued, growing out of his at-
tempt to overthrow the Eu Society
through bribery by the Philan-
thropic Sogiety. Five were for dec-
laration of martial law, well know-
ing that no state of insurrection
or rebellion existed, Another charge
was brought against “Iron Pete” for
preventing; by the use of his gun-
men, the meeting of a grand jury
called to investigate his record.
Chief of all was the charge for
using militia and gynmen in his
attempt to prevent the election
which repudiated him so success-
fully,

which has instructions to investi-
gate further the real connection be-
tween “Mad Jack” Hunter,

cleus for bribery from Phi Hall
and gunmen from KKK. It seems
