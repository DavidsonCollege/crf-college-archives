Eating out on the Court: how your house rates

By ANJALI SHARMA
and VASHIST WORAH

Do you have a weight problem?
Let Patterson Court take care of
that! If you want to lose weight,
join a women's eating house. If
you want to gain weight, join a fra-
ternity. Although the surround-
ings and the utensils are much the
same, each house on the Court has
its own distinct personality and
flavor, as well as its specialities.

For salads, we recommnd Rusk.
Don’t let the large number of girls
intimidate you. They are quite
nice, and they talk of all the normal
' things that collegiates do: dates,
parties and classes. You won’t go
hungry around Rusk: there’s al-
ways plenty to go around. The day
we dined here, a menu of hot dogs,
salad and boiled potatoes was
served for lunch.

Phi Delt offers you a peek into
their kitchen when you go to col-
lect your food. It’s “Cordon Bleu”
today: kind of like dumplings with
lots of grease in it. This entree is
accompanied by salad and bread.
The topic of conversation was,
inevitably, sports and the role of
Phi Delt.

If you’re a diet-conscious
grease-avoider, try Spencer. Sau-
sages, eggs, apple-sauce and bread
highlighted the meal we ate. Con-
versation gushes forth as members
apologize:, “There, are; normally.
more people here,..the food’s usu-
ally better.” We agreed that the
food was good (try the sausages).
Listen carefully and you will learn
that boys and parties, papers and
professors are also a topic.of con-
versation here.

Davidson pré-meds

“Not just a bunch of science geeks who want six-

fi igure salaries.”
, BY TRENT STEVENS

It is not a surprise tliat one out of every
five Davidson students follows a premedi-
cal curriculum for undergraduate study. The
popular major includes those planning to
— medical school, dental school and
school. Approximately 5 per-
on of premedical students graduate from
Davidson with acceptances to post-graduate

schools.

triumph of the human spirit when someone
overcomes a deadly disease” would be one
of the greatest rewards in his chosen profes-

“My dad’s a doctor,” he adds, “I’ve
never thought of being anything else.”
Hisroommate, Will Warlick, isanother

who refutes stereotypes.

“The greatest reward [of being a doc-
tor] will be my ability to help others and
_improve their quality of life,” he said. He
cited “helping others” and his academic
leanings toward science as being the main
reasons for his career direction. Despite
those academic leanings, other ones have

led him to major in history.

but he has already decided that he wants to
go to medical school. “I’ve always been
interested in science,” he said. He plans to

And then there was PAX. Be-
lieve us, this is no place for meek-
hearted frat brothers! Those paper-
ball fights can really get out of
hand, and the risk for serious in-

rowdy, uncontrolled atmosphere
is what you’re looking for, this is
the place to go. It’s a little boring
