aims of the student magazine.
It will assist the editor in
achieving these aims by advis-
ing him and by discovering and
channeling to him material for
his editorial consideration.

The Board will choose candi-
dates for editorship of the stud-
ent magazine from recommenda-
tions submitted by the staff of
the magazine and report them
to the Publications Board for
final consideration. The Board

the selection of candidates for

a Student Council by-law at a
later date, following further
discussion.

ent Council meeting centered
around the conduct of the pres-
