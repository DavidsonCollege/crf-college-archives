Some Like it Hot & ©
The main Event

HIS WEEK FINE FILMS PRESENT
] one of the finest comedies to
have come out of Holly-
wood. Some Like it Hot was directed
by Billy Wilder, the man now most
‘closely associated in most people’s
minds with the old-style big-studio
System ‘of film manufacture.
Wilder’s legendary perfectionism,
as much as the faultless performan-
ces of his stars certainly helped pro-
duce in this case a comedy of almost
endless amusement. Tony Curtis and
Jack Lemmon turn in finely judged
comic performances while Marilyn
Monroe is quite astonishingly good
at her usual line of dithery comedy in
_ a script full of double entendre, yet
she displays a-charmingly inncoent
sexuality which perfectly comple-
ments the murkily risqué plot.
Set in the Roarine ’Twenties
this plot concerns the f; _. of Curtis
and Lemmon, two jaz. musicians

‘_. :whorinadvertantly-become witnesses

of the S' Valentine’s Day Massacre.

Pursued by the mob, they escape by ~

_dressing in drag and joining an all-
woman ensemble where they meet
Marilyn, a ukelele-playing lush.
Thinking themselves safe in Florida,
where the jazz-ensemble has a resid-
ency, they find themselves sharing

the same hotel as a Mafia-convention -

headed by their criminal nemesis,
the lugubrious ‘Spats.’
-At this point Curtis and Lem-

mon’s_attempts to have their-way—

with Marilyn become hopelessly

frustrated — she is convinced. that
they are women and a holidaying
playboy has decided that Lemmon is
the woman of his dreams.

From then onwards the plot
slides off into high-class farce of the
very finest sort, relying as it does up-
on the themes of transvestism and
mistaken identity.. Wilder never
once lets the pace flag, and indeed
works up a commendably frothy
head of lunatic frenzy in a series of
increasingly bizarrre and embarrass-

ing incidents in the later reels. Most

impressive of the lot however is un-
doubtedly Monroe whose comic
sense of timing and sexual allure
make this probably her finest perfor-
mance at a time when, it is said, she
was already going downhill. (Nor-
man Mailer, in his less-then-reliable
biography, claims that-her habitual
lack of punctuality kept Curtis and
Lemmon hanging around on-set in
their uncomfortable ‘drag ‘outfits for
hours at a time, a point hotly disput-
ed by her more .charitable apolo-
gists.)

From the beginning to the end
(featuring probably the best punch-
line in movies) this film boasts a flow

of fine one-liners and a series of de-
lightful situations, I thoroughly rec-

ommend that you make the effort to
go along to Love Auditorium on
Wednesday the 13" at 8.00 PM.

For those of you who are con-
noisseurs of movie trivia and the
like, here is the one piece of such in-

formation which I know of associat-
ed with this film. As you are all of
course aware Some Like it Hot is in
fact a remake of an earlier German
version of the same story. Can you, |
by the way, name the all-girl jazz en-

semble in the Germai film? No
prizes, alas.

onight’s Pop Film is the Ryan
T O’Neal / Barbra Streisand

collaboration of a few years
ago, The Main Event. Although it
was probably a mistake to try to re-
capture the comic excellence of their
earlier hit What:s Up Doc? this styl-
ish comedy is far from being devoid
of belly-laughs and guffaws. Strei-
sand plays a ruined millionairess
whose husband / business-manager
has left her with only one asset — a
second-rate prize-fighter who was
purchased years ago as a tax-loss.
The pugilist in question is of course

O'Neal and his attempts to shape up
under the capable hands of M*® Strei-
sand make-for some fine comedy
which is not entirely overpowered by
the stature of the protagonists. Rec-
ommended.
