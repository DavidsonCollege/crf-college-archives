Yearbook Staff Fights
Problems That Beset It Z

By STEVE ROADY
Associate Editor

_ In theory, Davidson’s yearbook
18 a product of many -well-coor-
dinated hours of efficiently divid-
ed labor. In practice, however,
the publication that appears on
campus each spring is the crea-
tion of fhe editor and a small num-
ber of helpers, who crank their
pages out in short bursts of fren-
zied activity just in time to meet
various deadlines.

Each year the incoming editor
arranges a contract with the print-
ing company that fixes between
three and five deadlines for the
upcoming school year. About fif-
ty pages are due at each deadline,
and the week preceding each sees
the drawing together of all the
materials needed to create the
numerous layouts,

In order to piece together the
story of the mechanics of produc-
ing the QUIPS AND CRANKS,
this reporter interviewed four of
the 1969-1970 staff members:
Sports Editor Johnny Bruner,
Organizations Editor Fred Wilson,
Photography Editor Rich Howard,
and Business Manager Craig Gar-
ner. All agreed that the position
of general editor is of critical im-
portance,

Bruner observed that in past
years “the editor is the guy who
has done most of the work on the
yearbook,” and stated that in
many cases the editor . naturally
takes over the position of layout
manager, simply because it is
easier for him to project his ideas
directly ‘onto the page, rather
than work through someone else.

He stated that in his case, the
editor decided how many pages
would be allotted to each sport,
then left him to his own devices
until about a week before the
particular deadline.

A major duty involved in put-
ting out the sports pages was the
collection of rosters, schedules,
and results. This information was
obtained from the College Infor-
mation Bureau as well as from
the various coaches, and did not
always prove easy to get.

Organizations editor Wilson
used the computer to obtain com-
plete lists of the members of the
respective fraternities, and con-
tacted faculty advisers in order
to secure the names of people in
other organizations on campus.

Other than name-collecting,
Wilson’s main job was the sched-
uling of fraternity pictures. This,
he said, presented ja two-fold prob-
lem. First; several fraternities
were not overly cooperative in
showing up at the appointed times,
and second, coordinating frater-
nity free time with photographer
free time proved difficult. He not-
ed that in several cases the gen-
eral editor ultimately,,had to set
a final ‘now or never” time in
order to meet a deadline.

Photography editor Howard al-
so commented on the fraternity
scheduling difficulty. Of the three
major tasks which the yearbook
photographers had to handle —
finding two hundred seniors for
individual portraits, locating each
faculty member for an individual
picture, and taking the fraterni-
ties — Howard stated that the
last involved by far the most dif-
ficulty.

Business Manager Garner began’
his work last spring when he
submitted a budget for this year’s
QUIPS AND CRANKS. But, as is
apparently the common practice,
this budget was not reviewed un-
til mid-October, when the Student
Finance Committee cut it substan-
tially. Garner observed that the
school routinely cuts »proposed
publication budgets while keeping

a reserve on hand to meet. the
resulting expense which: occurs
over and above the lowered final
proposal.

.Major revenue sources for the

Quips and Cranks include adver- -

tisements, sales of yearbooks to
faculty members, the Admissions
Office, and other extra-student
bodies, and the collections made
from all organizations that: re-
ceive space in the yearbook. Gar-
ner finds this last method of
raising money ‘tawdry and repul-
sive,” but has been frustrated in
his attempts to do away with it.

While acknowledging that the
QUIPS AND CRANKS owes the
school quite a bit of money, Gar-
her revealed that this year’s edi-
tion will definitely finish in the
black. The problem here, he said, .
is that “you don’t find out how
much you are-going to run in the
black until the last deadline has
been met,” and by that time it is
too late to go back and add “‘ex-
tras” such as more. color.

The general mechanics of
QUIPS AND CRANKS production
this yea involved the combined,
often all-night, efforts of the gen-
eral editor, the photography edi-
tor and the business manager sev-
eral, days before each deadline.
The photographers wouid work up
a contact sheet for each page in-
cluded in the particular deadline,
and the editor and helpers would
decide which prints to use.

The layouts were done around
the photos after they had been
printed and cropped. Each layout
sheet had to be done in triplicate,
the necessary copy had to be typ-
ed, and finally the entire bundle
had. to be shipped to the printer
in Maryland. Several times this
year the editor had to dash to Win-
ston-Salem to catch the 3 a.m;
bus in order to ensure the on-time
arrival of the material.

As the job develops, the edi-
tor’s position demands both the
talents of a creator and the skills

of an administrator. The editor
must be able to produce original
introducttons, commentary and
division pages, as well as ride
herd on the sometimes recalcitrant
printing company.

There seems to exist a need for
a much better operating division
of labor. One solution might be
the’ installation of co-editors, ane
to create, the other to adminis-
trate. The present situation calls
for an inordinate amount of work {
from one man.

Historical Annual Shows
‘Self-Portrait’ Progress

By JOE SMITH
Associate Editor

“In this, our first issue, we have
striven to. produce a volume
worthy of our institution, and
while we realize our imperfec-
tions and shortcomings we ask of

"our readers an indulgent criticism

and that recognition and appre-
ciation merited by all honest en-
deavor.”

With these words the editors of
the first QUIPS AND CRANKS
opened their issue of what was to
become an institution of the col-
lege for more than-seventy years.
For the inaugural issue, publish-
ed in 1895, was the first of a
series of efforts by Davidson stu
dents at capturing and memorial-
izing their experiences here.
These volumes are a fascinating
collection because of this ‘fact,
for they mirror the ways in which
Davidson men have regarded
themselves over the’ years.

In the first place, the inaug-
ural edition reveals an interest
in. history and literature among
the Davidson students of that year,
Published under thg auspices of
the two literary societies, Philan-
thropic and Eumenean, a great
deal of space is devoted to poetry.
Various histories occur through-
out as well: those of the college,
classes, fraternities, and literary
societies. Copy is the predomin-
ate factor in this volume with
photography taking a decided
second place.

With the exception of the pro-
fessors, all eight of them, the rest
of the pictures in the ’95 QUIPS
AND CRANKS are of groups. The
Davidson man _ portrayed him-
self as a member of a class (only
the seniors were pictured), a
social fraternity, or an athletic
team.

A lighter:side of the class of '95
“is revealed in the nicknames which
its members possessed: Bones,
Nuts, Old Soul, Goat, Baby, Mush,
Lightening Rod. These’ brash
students even had the temerity
to call “their ‘ professors such
names as Tilt, Project, and Old
Puss.

The nature of extra-curricular
activities also says a good deal
about the Davidson man ‘of 1895.
Along with the usual variety of
varsity sports, a large number of
clubs were available for the whil-
ing away of idle hours. Notable
among these are the Whistling

Kentz Cites Student Apathy Toward Quips
And Cranks; Proposes Possible Changes

By HARRELL RENTZ
Editor of Quips and Cranks

ED. NOTE: Harrell Rentz, editor
of this year’s Quips and Cranks,
was requested by THE DAVID-
SONIAN to write about the na-
ture of his publication. In doing
so, Rentz reveals the interest
shown in QUIPS AND CRANKS
by the student body in a™recent
survey. Here he also discusses the
crisis that QUIPS AND CRANKS
faces next year since thereis as
yet no editor or official staff, and
offers some possible alternatives
that could be implemented to give
QUIPS AND CRANKS new life.

AND CRANKS has played all of
these roles to some extent. The
first of the two major problems
confronting the yearbook today is
an identity crisis: What should
the yearbook be? The second
problem is whethei or not the
time and money spent is justified
by the end result and student
interest in the book.

Had there been a candidate for
editor, he would simply have
started to work continuing the
tradition, and very little would
have been said about the year-
book one way or the other. In the
present situation it is still true
that very little is being said one
way or the other, but at least a
few people have begun to think
about whether or not the year-
book is a tradition worthy of con-
tinuation.

Of-the-reles—tisted-above,onty
that of ‘‘memory book” is truly
unique to the QUIPS AND
CRANKS, The Wildcat Handbook,
THE DAVIDSONIAN, and the Mis-

cellany contribute more effectively .

to each of the other areas. “‘In-
stant nostalgia for the years
ahead.” This is one description
of the yearbook proposed by the
*68 editor.

“The yearbook will be a nice
thing ‘to have in fifteen or twen-
ty years to remind me of old
school days, old friends, and good
times.” This seems to be the main
reason for having a yearbook,
according to most defenders.
Like it or not, this does seem to
be the yearbook’s reason for ex-
istence.

The extent to which the year-
book is record of achievements
and events is directly dependent

book succeeds or fails. according
to the perceptions of the staff.
However, good or bad, the year-

students.

Are students interested in hav-
ing a yearbook? The results of
a recent questionnaire indicated
that only forty-two students were
interested enough in having a
book to return the questionnaire.
Of the forty-two only twelve had
the time and the interest to
serve on the staff:

Of the twelve one had limited
experience working on a college
yearbook, seven had experience
working on a high school book,

*four had no experience. This cer-

tainly indicates a very limited
amount of interest on the part of
the student body and a definite
lack of experience on the part of
staff members,

The future of the QUIPS AND
CRANKS is shaky at best, and,
in the opinion of this editor, this
is not necessarily bad. The alter-
natives appear to be discontinu-
ation of the present book, a dras-
tic change in format, or continua-
tion in the present form.

The last may not be an alter-
native at all, considering the lack
of experience and interest noted
earlier. Perhaps the best answer

lies in a drastic change in format.

The ’67 QUIPS AND CRANKS
was a step in this direction, but
even this edition contained tiring
group shots and lists of names.
If the burden of picturing every
student in the school, listing the
achievements of the seniors, and
‘cataloguing: various groups could

handbook, the QUIPS AND
CRANKS could be a free form
publication whose function could
be capturing the spirit of a year
in photographs, art work, poetry,
and prose. It could rise to the
literary and artistic level of The
Miscellany and at the same
time serve as a memory book of
a year in the life of a school. Who
knows, it might even be a me-
morable book.
