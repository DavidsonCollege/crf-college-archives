formed the receiving line. Old
|scholars greeted their former pro-
| fessors while new men became per-
| sonally acquainted with those men
who will direct their courses in the
future on the Hill, }
| After having received the warm
| welcome and hearty hand-shake ex-
jtended by each member of the re-
| ceiving line, the gathering was serv-
jed refreshments from three booths
jthat were decorated in those colors
used in the color scheme of the room.

The program of the evening was

jacting as official announcer. His
| witty remarks in introducing each
Imember of the program gave a touch
lof realism to the evening’s entertain-
jment and drew round after round
of applause from those assembled.

After having apologized for the
| failure to use hand painted and high-
jly tinted scenery, Piggy introduced

jhis curtain for the evening perform-

lance. He called forth Fresh

jcelass, and Fresh Carrigan, the mid-
}get who towers six and a quarter
j feet, calling them the long and the
j short of the class,

Was singing and banjo playing by
Joe Earnest, the string musician
from Chueckey, Tenn, His perform-

ance pleased the audience very
highly, but he finally bade them
adieu and gave way to the an-
nouncer,

As the second number on the bill
Freshmen Austin, Alexander and

Proveaux put ona feeble imitation
of Davidson in the early seventies,
when the pine board was the only
board of control, Old.men who were
here at a later date than the carly
seventies term the performance as
mild. The Freshmen performed
well, not to have been experienced
youngsters at the game.
