Linksmen Hopeful

In Furman Tourney

By TOM SOOS
Staff Writer

After being beaten by William
and Mary last Tuesday, the Da-
vidson linksters hope to put in a
good showing at the Furman In-
vitaticnal Match today.

Coneerning last week’s loss,
Coach Tom Scott stated that
Rusty Boyd was very impres-
sive in the Cats 13%-7% effort.
Boyd shot a 78 at the Charlotte
Country Club, one William and
Mary player did better with a
77.

Boyd was not available for a
comment because he is in South
Carolina preparing for the Fur-
man match,

Scot: also stated that the rea-
son for some of the bad scores
was that the course was quite
wet.

The Furman Invitational will
be one of the best tournaments
that the linksters will partici-
pate in this year.

Among the schools represent-
ed will be Tennessee and Geor-
gia, two really fine golf schools.
Scott feels that Davidson does
not hold much of a chance to
place in the tournament but
said that it would give the play-
ers a chance to compete in top
competition and that some indi-
viduals would do pretty good.

He also hopes the tournament
will help prepare the team for
the Southern Conference Tour-
names,

In the Conference, the teams
to watch for are East. Carolina
and Furman, according to Scott.
East Carolina edged Furman in
last year’s tournament and Da-

vidson finished fourth
third place Citadel.
The tournament in Greenville
is not the only action for the
linksters in the coming week.
This afternoon the number
two teams will face a team

behind

from Trenton Teachers College,

Trenton, New Jersey. .
Monday the number one team
will host N. C. State.

make peaceful
revolution
impossible, will
make violent
revolution
inevitable.

alive, as they remained the ma-
jor threat of the lower bracket

group. e
In the semi-finals, it will be
Pax II against the F & M

squad, while the Keeter’s and
SPE’s vie for the upper brac
ket's top position.

“T'd say that the two favor
ites would have to be the Reet
er’s and Fanny & Mabel.” said
the KA‘s) player coach, John
Brandon.

Fanny & Mabcl teads the cur-
rent IMAC standings with 799.2
points. The SPE’'s ace i1 third
place with 581.9. and Pax is
tied with the SAE‘s for fifth,
with 445.9.

The Keeter’s have jlaved on
tv basketball and vollesball,
and consequently have no cum
ulative point total.

The team with the best over-
all record for volleyball games
will receive 160) points, with
ten bonus points for winning
the tournament.

Teams in the top five in over
all point’ standings, bui which
did not make the semi-finals of
the volleyball contest, are the
second place Dells, with 622.48
points, and Emanon, in fourth,
with 457.18.

tion program, the system has
achieved some of its goals.

It has lessened the class load
a great deal, and allowed the
Coaches to teach classes in
their individual interests.

“The enrollment in gym clas-
ses has dropped to about 200-
250," Martin said, ‘‘as opposed
to about 400 last: year,”

Martin said that the new sys-
tem has encouraged students
lo participate more in the ‘ex.
otic” programs offered by the
department.

Since a student must take a
proficiercy test at the end of
every course, he is more like-
ly to opt for a class that teaches
“# sport about which he has lit-
tle prior knowledge.

The biggest problems Scott
indicated were in the transition
to the new program.

The biggest problems anti-
cipated by both Martin and
Scott concern sophomores who
do not fulfill their requirements.

“If a student has not passed
five proficiency tests by the
end of his sophomore year,”
Scott said. ‘the will be put in
a class im the fall.”

This class will have required
attendance (the others do no*)
and will likely be in what Scott
calls ‘‘conditioning”.

“These classes will be re-
quired according to the guide-
lines of the new program,”
Scott said ‘‘and each student
will take one a term for every
credit he is behind. ”

Other than this problem with
rising juniors, both Scott and
Martin feel that the program is
operating smoothly at prescot.
