Davidson students Alyson
Browett and Emily Halyburton
were held up in a parking lot in
Charlotte after attending an Edwin
McCain concert at City Fair on
Saturday, February 11.

The robber only got two dol-

huge scare. They both parked their
cars outside of Carpe Diem, a res-
taurant in Charlotte where

Halyburton works, five blocks
away from City Fair where the
concert was held.

They left City Fair at about

started walking to their car. When °

they reached the parking lot, aman
on a mountain bike rode up to them
and said, “Well, well, well, what
do we have here?” Browett and
Halyburton ignored him and con-
tinued to walk to their car. The
man then threatened them with a
gun and demanded their money.
They only had two dollars

each, which seemed to antagonize
the robber. Browett gave the man
her money. He then asked for their
Jewelry. Browett put one ring in
her mouth and Halyburton hid a
ring in her back pocket, but the
robber managed to get two other
rings.

Browett says, “We were both °

completely calm.” He then asked

for their car keys. They ignored
his request:and kept walking to
their car. The robber threatened to
kidnap them and asked for the keys
once again.

came upon a surprising fact.

As treasurer of Phi Delta Theta, Steven Shames
According to the
books, his fraternity, like the others, is paying around
$5,000 a year for insurance. However, this insur-
ance is based upon the stipulations that parties are
closed, guest lists are issued, and no kegs exist.
According to Shames, now President of the
Patterson Court Council, “If you look at the insur-
ance, we were all in violation.” This would leave the
houses uncovered if an accident were to happen.
However, upon probing deeper into the issue, it
appears that the situation is not as bad as it seems.
Patterson Court Advisor Kurt Holmes says, “We

need to juggle the good things against the bad things.
We do a lot to mitigate the problems.”
The Problem

Kegs do exist, and parties are open to anyone who
wants tocome to them. Many students cite this policy
as a factor in choosing Davidson, and many feel that
closed parties would sour the flavor of the school.
Guest lists would improve the insurance situation, but
at the considerable cost of student satisfaction on the
Court. Holmes knows this and wants to “to manage
all this the best we can without stifling the social life”

Holmes cannot remember a time when “‘we have
been sued” but describes our situation as “dodging
bullets.” Hypothetically, if an intoxicated student

SGA passes

“health care" plan

Congress couldn’t do it; B.J. can

By Amy WHITMIRE
Staff writer

After much debate over the
resolution’s format and wording,
the SGA passed a resolution call-
ing for better health services in the
Davidson College Student Health
Center at the February 14 meeting

3 ba, a 4s SGA... ATR SNR TREE Te co eT
sea 5 “Declaration of Rights.”

written by Senior Class President
B.J. Rudell and modified slightly
by the SGA, contains both student
requests forhealth service improve-
ments and students’ anecdotes
about their experiences with the
Health Center.

In the SGA meeting on Janu-
ary 31, the majority of the SGA
Senators voted to return the decla-
ration to Rudell in order for him to
add headings to each subsection of
the document. SGA minutes for
that meeting stated that senators
wished to “spell out specific ex-
pectations for each problem in the
declaration in order to measure its
success.”

Rudell accordingly created a
summary list of rights that will be

resented along with the rest of the

Declaration to Student Health Cen-
ter Director Dr. David Staton, Dean
of Students Tom Shandley, and the
trustees.

After sophomore Senator
Nicola Hartery’s friendly amend-
ment which slightly altered the
wording of one of the headings
was passed, the SGA almost unani-

sly... approved..the. resolution
with one opposition.

Although some students have
been satisfied with their visits to
the Student Health Center, the
SGA’s “Declaration of Rights” will
hopefully lead to improved health
services for all students and thus
lead to increased confidence in the
Health Center for those students
who have had problems with the
Infirmary in the past.

“I commend those people in
SGA who spoke out in full support
of the document. I’m glad that we
finally got it passed. We’ll take it
to Dr. Staton and see whathe thinks.
We’ ve had even more complaints
this week, andif we think it’s mov-
ing too slowly we’ll talk to them
about it. This is an issue that will
come to fruition by the end of the
year,” says Rudell.

Former Davidson student

arrangement to park his car and
store his bike at a friend’s house
five minutes from campus. Reeves
was riding his bike to this friend’s
house when he encountered the
shooter.

As he rode down the street, a
blue Honda came speeding back at

him in reverse at an estimated 20

mph. From within the car he heard
the driver, a man, yell, “Don’t go

down there!” Reeves thought it
was strange that he could hear the
man shout since the car’s windows
were closed, but Reeves assumed
the driver was having an intense
argument with the women in the
passenger seat.

Reeves continued toridedown

of him he saw a man walking to-
