TO DAVIDSON.

Rev. H. C. Whitener, 09, is now
in North Carolina on his first fur-.
lough from Japan. Mr. Whitener
took his theological training at
Princeton and went to Japan under
care of the Northern Church.

Rev. M. J. McLean, '07, of Mor-,
gan City, La., has been instrumental
in completing an attractive church
for his little charge. During the war
period he put on overalls and work-
ed in the shipyards of Morgan City,
giving the high wages earned to the
building fund, and then he worked
with his own hands on the building.
It is completely furnished and has
a new organ and was dedicated on
April 12.

Send me back to Alma Mater,
Where the summer skies are blue,
Where the gods walk mid the shad-
ows,
In the Sunset’s rosy hue.

For I’ve heard their voices calling,
And it’s there that I would be,

The dear heart of the old Campus,
Beckons with its love to me.

To the shadows of trees stately,
Setting quietly on the hill,
To the dear old college campus,
My own thoughts are turning

to her students. A large Junior class |
is expected next year; thirteen men
from the Presbyterian College of!
South Carolina have already signed
up and several are expected from!
Davidson, as well as a good number |
from Alabama, Tennessee, Florida
and Georgia.

ing, president; Dr. R. C. Reed, pro-
fessor of Church History and
Church Polity; Prof. E. D: Kerr,
professor of Hebrew; Dr. W. M.

ology; Dr. H. R. Murchison, busi-
ness manager and corresponding
secretary.
