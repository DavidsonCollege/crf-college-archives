A Question Of Honor

Last week the Student Council re-
moved the Judicial Board from the
newly revised Student Body Constitu-
tion.

The Judicial Board proposal was
originally intended to replace the
Honor Court in trying all violations
of the student body regulations. The
Honor Court was to handle only
honor offenses.

THE DAVIDSONIAN opposed the
adoption of the Judicial Board as it
felt the Honor Court should continue
to enforce the student body regula-
tions. ;

Now that the Judicial Board has
been defeated the question arises:
What is to be done about the lack of
enforcement of the Honor System
and the student body regulations?
What can be done to make the student
body believe in both the letter and
the spirit of the Student Body Consti-
tution? .

The Honor Court has had difficulty
this year getting students to testify
at trials. One Honor Court member
had to go to a freshman’s room and
convinee him that his testimony was
important in a case.

One of the main reasons students,
particularly freshmen, are not enforc-
ing the Honor System is because they
do not fully understand what the
Honor System really is. They consider
being duty bound to report violations
a- much lighter responsibility than
being honor bound. They feel Honor

Court and Student Council members,
who are honor bound, should report
all violations. Therefore, the term
duty bound becomes meaningless.

We strongly support a new program
the Student Council will discuss at its
next meeting. The program falls under
three headings: (1) definition, (2) edu-
cation, and (3) enforcement.

First, the Student Council will ask
the faculty to clarify all regulations
in the Student Body Constitution using
specific examples to explain what is
considered a violation of each regula-
tion. For example, the faculty will be
asked to give an exact definition of
what is pledged work in the chemistry
laboratory aS opposed to what is
pledged work on book reports.

Second, the Student Council will
plan a more thorough discussion of
the Honor System during Orientation
Week so that freshmen understand
what the System means and sincerely
desire to enforce its regulations.

Third, the Student Council will pro-
mote a renewed effort by both the
Honor Court and Student Council
members to look for and report viola-
tions. Many members now turn their
backs on violations of the student
body regulations.

We urge the Student Council to
draw up a program of this type to
eliminate any danger of Davidson's
Honor System becoming a mockery

The Phi Delta Thespians

Every now and then another of
Davidson’s social .fraternities spon-
sors a project worthy of special note
—a project designed to benefit the
community at large as well as the
members themselves.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon last year
initiated a series of open forums with
distinguished visitors at the SAE
house, including North Carolina
Senator Sam Ervin; Beta Theta Pi
_ brothers and pledges have been help-

ing out on Saturdays at a Gastonia
orthopedic hospital; Alpha Tau Omega
last year sponsored a charity benefit
“Olympics.”

Other fraternities have joined the
new movement toward community

service projects, and every new effort
has meant good will for fraternities

and good experiences for fraternity

members.
Last Week Phi Delta Theta an-

nounced the most original project
we've heard of lately.

A group of Phi Delts plan to pro-
duce two one-act plays in the spring;
the first will be a dramatization of
Benet’s “John Brown's Body,” and
the second, “The Connection,’ a beat-
nik shocker which played last summer
in New York.

The Phi Delt project is not neces-
sarily suggestive of a sudden aesthetic
surge on fraternity row. Director Ben
Sparks had a simple explanation: ‘“‘We
knew it would be enjoyable and worth-
while, and there was tremendous en-
thusiasm, so we decided to do it.”

We congratulate Phi Delta Theta.

And we are glad that Davidson's
fraternities are spawning brand-new
ideas which can bring new depth and
enjoyment to fraternity life. ESD

To Joe Robinson: Thanks

In his remarks introducing this
year’s Book-of-the-Year program,
Chairman Joe Robinson remarked:
“In this program, I believe Davidson
College has found a new and pertinent
means of service to its community and
alumni, as well as to its students.
Making the college serve a vital educa-
tional purpose outside the limited
scope of its own community is one of
the most difficult, but most important
of its functions. Tonight and in the
future, Davidson hopes to better ac-
complish this community goal.”

We whole heartedly agree with this
statement (see last week’s editorial
“A Challenge to the College”). The
Book-of-the-Year program certainly
makes a vital contributien to this
broad educational goal. Wendesday
night, Davidson was ro longer a
sheltered cloister out in the sticks, but,
rather, was a live, cosmopolitan, intel-
lectual center, drawing visitors from
near (Cornelius) and far (William and
Mary).

With programs such as the Book-of-
the-Year ore and the Reynolds
Lectures (which has yet to receive the
publicity it deserves), Davidson Col-
lege can begin to live up to its reputa-

tion. By promoting such programs and
encouraging outside participation,
Davidson will truly become an educa-
tional center, rather than just a se-
cluded campus.

The benefits will touch not only the
guests, but also the immediate college
community itself. The numerous
visitor-student discussions during the
coffee hour Wednesday night added
an exciting freshness to the campus
atmosphere. The new ideas and fresh
perspectives produced renewed vigor
in student discussion. The biologist,
wary of excessive interbreeding, intro-
duces new strains to maintain vigor
within various families. The same
principle applies here.

As a program within this new, broad
educational vision, the Book-of-the-
Year was a great success. As with all
programs which set a high ideal, it
was not without its problems and
shortcomings, but its success far over-
shadows these few points.

The success of the program is
largely due to the sacrifice of time and
energy of Chairman Joe Robinson and
Faculty Advisor Max Polley. To them
goes our warmest expression of appre-
ciation. TBC.

ed with a motto.

Since 1956, THE DAVID-
SONIAN has been published

with the legend, “The News
and Editorial Voice of Da-
vidson College” printed un-
der its nameplate. And at
least once every year since
1956, the newspaper has
taken a controversial — and
minority stand which oppon-
ents have denounced as in-
consistent with the motto of
the paper.

“The majority of Davidson
students don’t agree with
you, so you're not really be-
ing the editorial voice of
Davidson College,” they pro-
test.

No Implication

There is nothing in the

motto that concretely implies
any obligation to print the
majority opinion of those
connected with Davidson Col-
lege.

Instead, the phrase states
only that this newspaper is
the publication issued by the
college that concerns itself
with news and editorial mat-
ter. After all, is there any
other publication on the
campus whose purpose is to
present current news and
editorial opinion?

In grammatical terms, the
word of is the trouble maker.

Of, upon superficial exami-
nation, may be taken to mean
representation. A preposition
more indicative of the real
implicaton of the motto is
in. An ideal expression of the
precise meaning, therefore,
is “The News and Editorial

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Two Students Air Views
On Vespers, Magazine

BILL DEAKE

Dear Editor,

“I was sitting on the back
row last Sunday night. When
the plate goz to me : only
had thirteen cents in it.”
my friend related to me. You
will probably gather very
quickly what my friend and
I were talking about: the
passing of the offering plate
during vespers on Sunday
night.

It seems to me that there
is room for improvement on
the matter of collecting the
offering at that service.
There must be a way in
which this part:of the service
can be smoothed out for I'm
sure that the Lord doesn’t
enjoy seeing the same con-
test between the boys on the
left hand side of the aisle
and the boys on the right
side every week.. After all,
offering plates were not de-
signed for speed!

There seems to be some
eonfusion between = the
terms collection and offer:
ing. They are certainly not
the same thing and can not
be treated as the same.

What occurs in the sane-
tuary is not supposed to be a
collection but an offering.
Many times we don’t take the
time to consider either of
them, but count it as just
another part of the service.

Since the vesper services
are not voluntary In nature,
there exists at times a
spirit which is a bit short
of reverent. This is the
logical consequence for
people. Others still find
vespers can be more of an
asset than a liability end
govern themselves sccord-
ingly, ‘ ‘

Believing that the old say-

is perfectly justified in its

ing “God loveth a cheerful
giver’ still has significance
and that the expression of
such a giver be shown con-
sideration, I make the fol-
lowing suggestion.

Instead of sticking to
the present method, !
suggest that the plates not
be passed among the stu-
dents any longer. For
these desirous of making
an offering, wooden Joash
boxes could be set up in
the Nerthex for this pur-
pose. | heve seen this
method before and know
thet it can be an effective

one.

If this could be adopted, a
lot of wasted motion could
be eliminated. With vesper
time reduced, due to such an
innovation, more interest
might be directed toward the
preacher instead of the
watches.

In reply to Mr. Ackerman:

Yes, little Ackerman,
you're right. The S & P has
squandered the _ student
body’s money on uninspired,
weak issues. And it could be
a good publication. It could
turn out original humor and
good attempts at serious
creative writing.

However, the magazine

Voice in Davidson College.”
This implies location rather
than representation — but
it is not as pleasing to the
ear, so we use of.

Practical Side

The grammatical approach
is pretty technical. But there

are practical considerations
that uphold our right to print

opinion that is not majority
opinion,

First THE DAVIDSONIAN
is not a polling service. It
Would be ludicrous for us to
seek a mandate from the stu.
dent body each week before
we write our editorials. Pol-
ling is expensive and time-
consuming. We resort to it
about twice a year, but we
have neither the time nor the
inclination to fool with it
every week for every editor-
ial.

apologies. The truth of the
matter is there are no
creative writers or humor-
ists at Davidson, This has
been proved time and
again. Every attempt to ob-
tain manuscripts of quality
hes run up against a brick
wall (eg. the Freshmen
writing contest).

The only writing going on
at Davidson is for courses.
The creative writing class is
able to obtain promising re-
sults, but none of the stu-
dents follow up.’

S & P, Sigma Upsiion
and such are not to blame.
They ere meant as outlets
for writers. The difficulty
is-that the “writers” aren‘t
letting anything out.

In closing, a few words
about the caliber of the
Davidson gentleman. If his
taste in literature is like his
taste in music (to wit, the
concert of last dance week
end), S & P as it now stands
should be just his cup of tea.

Bill Pruit

Letters to the Editor
should be typed and limited
to 250 words or less. They
must be received by the edi-
tor by Tuesday night in order
to appear in the next edition
of the paper. All letters must
be signed.

Second, as an editor of the
Wake Forest Old Gold and
Black once put it, the news-
paper is not a. corporation.
Just because a portion of the
expenses for THE DAVID-
SONIAN are paid out of the
general activity fee doesn’t
entitle every student to be
an editor. We welcome any-
one’s opinion and his criti-
cism, but beyond that he can
mind his own busness. He
pays only for the right to
read the paper, not for the
right to determine what goes
into it.

Open To All

Third, THE DAVIDSON-
IAN doesn’t print just one
side of an issue. We have a
considerable amount of space
on the editorial page open to
anyone who would like to
disagree with us. If he is
literate enough, we will even
let our opponent write a
column in disagreement, This
latter offer is an opportunity
offered by few newspapers,
but, few people here have
gumption enough to take ad-
vantage of it,

Earlicr in the we year, we
were admonished for print-
ing only those letters ‘that
agreed with our stand on the
Court of Control problem,
They were the only letters
we received. If the Majority
Opinion wants to disagree

with us, it is their responsi.

bility to put it on paper. We

don't solicit argument.
Slanted Hard

Fourth, it is simply news-
paper tradition that the edi-
torial page be slanted —
and slanted hard. Editors
who mollycoddle issues gen-
erally aren't good editoss.
Again, to quote the Wake
Forest writer, “Editorial
opinion must be consistent.
No newspaper prints two
editorials on the same sub-
ject] one contradicting the
other . . . But to say that the
editorial page is slanted is
an’ inane observation. It’s
supposed to be slanted. And
the clearer the position the
better,”

This is our stand. We are
entrusted with the responsi-
bility to report the news as
we see and hear it and to
comment on the news as we
see fit, If we can prick com-
placency’s balloon or take
a swipe at blind predjuduce,
we hope we'll have. the cour-
age to do it.

If we are wrong, we take
full responsibility. In 20
years, we may look back and
marvel at how we jousted at
windmills. But for the pres-
ent, we think we're right and
we'll put it in print.

FOCUS

Writer Duggan Spotlights
Players’ Actress Of Year

By ERVIN DUGGAN

The dullness of campus routine is relieved by
gentle surprises — usually people.

Faculty wives for instance: they’re all fasci-
nating. One plays the violin; another is an author-
ity on Albert Camus, and another an expert who
tectures annually on art to her husband's classes . .

And then there’s Mrs. Frontis Withers Johnston,

our case in point:

Mrs. Johnston, wife of Davidson’s Dean of
Faculty, isa serene brown-haired lady with a hint
of mischief in her expression. She always seems
to be faintly amused, as though the world might

be her favorite joke.

Mrs. Johnston is an actress.
In October, in “The Madwoman of Chaillot,’ she

To ME,“ HI, THERE!“ AND I AE oe JUST THINKS 1A
SAID-“WHO ARE U7 I * UN
DON'T RECOGNIZE You!” TOO SARCASTIC!

played an addle-brained matron who patted imaginary
animals, talked to invisible visitors and exchanged
hilariously fatuous dialogue with her lady friends.

Three weeks ago she captivated a dance week-end ~-
audience as Dolly Gallagher Levy — matchmaker,
varicose-vein reducer, and guitar instructor.

She brought down the house with a ladylike
“Damnit” uttered when her romatic scheming went
awry — and when things got better for the Match-
maker, she gazed into space and addressed her
long-dead first husband: “Well, I’m going to marry
Horace Vandergelder. For his money!”

Last week Mrs. Johnston was voted the Vagabonds’
“Best Actress of the Year.”

She’s a writer, too.

Mrs. Johnston is probably the only faculty wife
who has written for Seripts ‘n’ Pranks.

A wry sketch, printed last spring, related her
frenzied preparations to house a Davidson student's
weekend date — only to find at the last moment that
the girl wasn’t coming.

Mrs. Johnston keeps an eye on student afafirs.

At a Vagabond’s rehearsal recently she accosted
a DAVIDSONIAN staffer:

“| read that last Peper." she said in a voice
fraught with reproach. “You should be ashamed!
Why, do you know how these poor men have to
beat the bushes to find Trustees? And here you
go slandering them.”

Then she smiled.

“I did epjoy it, though,” she said — and she
headed backstage.

Like her husband, Mrs. Johnston is equal to every
occasion. But if Dean Johnston’s poise stems from a
strict sense of decorum, his wife's equanimity comes
from a sense of the ridiculous.

A few years ago during Hell Week, a knock came
at her front door in the wee hours...

“1 answered. the door and there was this
poor little freshman who was looking for a bird
nest! His fraternity brothers had sent him for a
bird nest.

“So there I was in my robe, at two in the morning,
holding a flashlight while that poor little boy climbed
a tree for a bird nest.”

They found the bird nest.

And, chances are, the remarkable Mrs. Johnston
returned happily to sleep with a shrug and an amused
smile.

The Dean's wife is gliding through life on
intelligence, tremendous verve, and a sense of
humor.

And that’s a good way to travel.
