The Eumanean Literary Society ex-
tends to all freshmen and all upper class-

literary society, a cordial invitation to

the initiation and feed to be held tonight

the constitution, passed at the last meet-

tonight, instead of going through ‘the
freshman society as heretofore. The
freshman society has been abolished.

| Church last Sunday morning from the text
found in Matthew 16:26: ‘For what is a
man profited, if he shall gain the whole
world, and lose his own soul? or what shall
a man give in exchange for his soul ?”

“The Word of God appeals to. every
principle which properly moves man to ‘act.
It invites careful and exhaustive study of
the statements of the scriptures,” Dr. Clark
stated. “Some have sought to frighten men
into a belief in the scriptures, but this is not
sanctioned by the scripture.”

“Jesus Christ appeals for a consideration
of man’s immortal soul,” he said. Going
further, he said that the Christian must be-
lieve in the capacity of the human mind to
receive and interpret the revelation of God
given through men. The true Christian
ought never to fear the searching of the
Word of God but some people are constantly
in fear of the investigations that are going
on. Investigation is proper and no Christian
should fear it. God’s Word invites it and
we should be glad of it.

“The text invites a comparison of things
spiritual and things material,” said Dr. Clark.
“Jesus Christ urged that men compare these
two. Who. knows anything about the soul?”
he questioned. “How can a man estimate the
value of anything of which he knows so
little?” At this -point he paid tribute to
those philosophers who are exploring this
phase of human thought but he added that no
one of them knows more about it than any-
e else.

“Our Savior appeals to us that we examine
this question—‘What is a man profited, if he
shall gain the whole world, and lose his own
soul? or what shall a man give in exchange
for his.soul?’ At certain times we will do
things that will jeopardize our immortal
soul and it is proper that we investigate.”
Substituting certain words, Dr. Clark queri-
ed, “What shall a man give in exchange for
his sight or his hearing? Certainly’ no one
would think, for an instant, of sacrificing his
sight. for the entire world, and is not a soul
more valuable than this ?”

Dr, Clark, in stating just what the soul is,
said, “It is some force or power which is re-
lated in an intimate way to man’s acts of

You cannot hear it but it is there. It tran-
scends the power of science and goes above

“It is by the soul that man sees, hears, un-
derstands and appreciates the beauties of
life; and what shall a man give in exchange
for that which enables him to do these

things? Year by year, the souls finds in-
creasing capacity for joy and also for
misery, As you face life, with its possi-

bility and sorrow, ‘What shall a man give in
exchange for his soul ?’” he concluded.

The “Y” has scheduled many new pictures
to appear during the fall and winter. They
have succeeded in getting a collection of the
best productions of the year.

The first of these will be presented on
October 2nd. Renee Adoree appears in
“Blarney,” ‘a fighting romance laid in New
York during the ’80’s.. An Irish lad, through
the influence of his sweetheart, upsets the
fighting dope of the time.

On October 9th “La Boheme” will play
here. © Lillian Gish and John Gilbert play
the leading parts, assisted by Carl Dane and
Roy D’Arcy. King Vidor, famous for his
direction of “The Big Parade,” directed this
picture. ‘La Boheme” is regarded as the
foremost picture of the year. It is full of
romance and beauty, and has as its back-
ground the gay life on the boulevards of
Paris.
There are many other pictures under con-
tract, but the time of their showing has not
been definitely decided. Among the- most
