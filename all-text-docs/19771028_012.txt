Cats display talents

Freshman Todd Haynes
scored 38 points and Pat
Hickert added 24 to lead the
Red team to a 100-90 victory
over the White squad in an
intrasquad basketball scrim-
mage game last Friday.

John Gerdy and freshman
Rick Dibenedetto paced the
White squad with 21 and 19
points, respectively.

Coach Dave Pritchett, when
asked if he was surprised by
Todd’s performance, which in-
cluded 15 of 18 from the
field—mostly from inside—re-
marked, ‘‘Not really. The key
was he (Todd) played with the
older team. Kevin (Doherty)
was on the team (Red squad)
and he’s played before. Hic-
kert and Bowker were on the
team and they played last
year. ‘‘They set good screens.

Screening and timing was the
important thing.’

Pritchett explained why the
scrimmage was held so early in
the year, “I think it is
important to get a lot of
scrimmage experience when
you have as many freshmen
and sophomores on the team
as we do.

“I was not intérested in
Gerdy Friday, put I wanted to
get the younger guys exper-
ience scrimmaging.

“We will hold a scrimmage
once a week, either Saturday
morning or Friday afternoon,
open to the public, from now
on in.”

This year the Cats have
changed their basic offense
because as Pritchett ex-
plained, ‘‘Last year we had to
get Marvin (Lively) involved,
and at times Gerdy, involved
at forward.

“Pat (Hickert) did not play
a lot his freshman year, so he

was basically a first year man.

So I thought our salvation was
to pull people away from the
basket and slice in.’’

“This year with the fresh-
men we're bigger, and with
Rod (Owens) and Pat we’re
more experienced. I think
we're better at the power
game, so we'll go inside
more.”’

The new offense involves a
lot of screening to free men
inside, which was responsible
for getting Haynes open inside
repeatedly in the scrimmage
game.

Pritchett comments on the
defense, ‘‘The guard defense is
good. Chris Dobbs is quick.

“The three other freshmen
(Todd Haynes, Brad Walker,
Rich Dibenedetto)
guard centers in high school so
it has been harder to establish
inside defense.”

On the serious attitude jun-
ior standout, John Gerdy, has
displayed in practice Coach
Pritchett said, ‘‘Last year he
saw how good he can be. The
last ten games last year set the
stage for John. He wants to
pick up where he left off.’’

Finally Coach Pritchett will
have the opportunity this year
to work with a much deeper
squad.

As Pritchett noted, ‘‘One
thing most people didn’t real-
ize last year was that we only
had six men on scholarship.
Kevin (Doherty) was lost and
Stallworth was out (with an
injury) for the season.

“This year we'll have four
more freshmen and our men
will have more experience. Our
depth will be much better. i

Kickers attempt to

snap losing streak

With only four games re-

_maining on the Fall soccer

schedule, the Wildcats are still
looking for their first win.

Their winless record,
though, is not indicative of the
caliber of Davidson soccer.
Several losses have been by
only one or two goals, and the
Wildcats are playing a suicide
schedule including teams like
Appalachian State, ranked in
the top ten in the nation.

The Wildcats’ biggest prob-

lem seems to be lack of *

experience. Unlike most of the
teams they are playing, Da-
vidson does not recruit very
heavily for Soccer. Therefore,
a large portion of this year’s
team is made up of walk-ons.

But the players, who are
mostly Freshmen and Sopho-
mores, and Coach Carl Krem-
ser are dedicated to making
Davidson soccer a success.

Throughout the season the
soccer team has shown steady
improvement.

However they are still too
inconsistent, allowing the op-
position to score too incon-
position to score most of its
points during brief breaks in
the Wildcats’ concerntration.
According to one player, ‘‘We
just can not figure out what is
wrong.”

Davidson begins a three
game home stand this Satur-
day against V.M.I. at 2:00.
The final match of the season
will be against Virginia in
Charlottesville on November
6.

The women’s field hockey
team returned from Winston-
Salem Monday with a 4-2

Johnson chipped in one apiece

upped the girls’ record ‘to 4-6
with games against Appala-
chian and Salem, remaining,
in addition to a short match
with a traveling British squad.

With the implementation of
a more potent offense and the

Coach Susan Roberts antici-
pated a succesful campaign for
this year’s team.

Injuries have proved costly,
however, as all but six of the
17 players have been sidelined
at one time or another with
various ailments.

But Roberts feels the girls’
record does not reflect the
level of play shown through-
out the season. ‘‘The kids have
really put out, and the scores
don’t show how they have
been playing,’’ she comment-
ed.

Roberts added, ‘I’m really
proud of the way they’ve stuck
together through thick and
thin."

Next week the team travels
to Furman for.the Deep South
Tourney, where a group of
outstanding players will be
culled from participating
teams to compete in regional
tournaments. Junior Kirk
Cameron was selected in '76
-and this year’s ‘eam_contains ,
several girls who merit consi-
deration.
