’Cats take five-set battle from Elon

(25-21, 25-18, 25-21).

The ’Cats continued their trip by taking
on Western Carolina, who they also beat in
only three games, (25-21, 25-18, 25-21).

Back in Davidson, the ’Cats took on
Southern Conference rival UNC-Greensboro,
on Friday night. Davidson dropped their fifth
conference match of the season, losing 3-1
(25-19, 12-25, 25-14, 25-10).

Madison Benedict ’12 had nine kills for
the team, hitting .263. Sarabeth Peele ’11
also had nine kills while Christine Perzinski
"12 had eight kills. Hayley Lawson ’11 had
32 assists for the "Cats and Jennifer Cham-
blee 711 had 14 digs.

Set one started out with an early UNC-G
run. The Spartans were able to jump ahead,
18-13 and hold that same momentum to win
the set, 25-19. In the second set, Davidson
took control early. Kittery Neale 12 had
kills early to set the tone. The ’Cats were able
to cruise to a 25-12 win.

Sets three and four saw Spartan domina-
tion, as UNC-G hit .464 in the third set and
.545 in the fourth. The Spartans picked up
the last two sets (25-14, 25-10) and took the
match over Davidson.

On Saturday, the ’Cats played at home
again, taking on the Elon Phoenix. The ’Cats
came out on top 3-2 (16-25, 21-25, 27-25,
25-22, 15-11). Leading the way for the Wild-
cat offense was Neale with 11! kills and Peele
with 16. Lawson had 41 assists and 10 digs
while Chamblee had 21 digs. Lawson, Madi-
son and Jorden Benedict ’11 combined for a
team high of 15 blocks.

In set one, Elon took control early, secur-
ing the win, 25-16. In the second set, the

ana

score was tied as late as 17. The two teams
traded points until Elon was able to break
away at 25-21.

In the third set, Neale had a five point
serving streak which allowed the ’Cats to
tie things up at eight all. Davidson was able
to secure the win for the set, capitalizing on
Phoenix hitting errors.

The fourth set saw early Wildcat com-
mand as the team jumped to a 14-9 lead
early. Strong serving from both Peele and
Perzinksi tied the score up at 21-21.

The ’Cats were able to hold strong and
came out victorious.

In the fifth and deciding set, Peele served
four straight points, giving the "Cats early
control. Perzinski’s serving closed up the set,
and ultimately, the game as the team won 15-
11. Davidson’s record is now 10-13 overall
and 5-5 in conference play.

The ’Cats are back on the road and face
Furman on Oct. 25.

day. Against Western Carolina, then tied for
second in the SoCon with Davidson, the ’Cats
let another tough contest slip past them.

The game started off slowly, and the
home team scored first. Off a rebound from
Mumby’s shot, Sittko slipped the ball into a
wide open goal in the 32nd minute.

Only five minutes later, the visitors re-
spondedwith the tying goal. Neither team
dominated the first half, with Western Caro-
lina holding even in shots, five to five.

The second half continued with much of
the same, each side attempting to grind the
other into a war of attrition. With less than 10
minutes remaining, Western capitalized on
a loose ball in the box, wrapping the game-
winner around the post.

Davidson’s fourth loss of the season ar-
rived the same way as all the others — by a
single goal.

With Elon and top-ranked UNC-Greens-
boro coming up this weekend, the ’Cats must
regain their composure. Until the tourney, ev-
ery game is on the road, without the blessing
of an Alumni Stadium crowd. The challenge
makes home-field advantage in the playoffs
even sweeter — “You want that home game —
it’s such an advantage,” Smith said.

To earn the top seed and more, the team
will rely on its shared goal, perspective and
approach.

“We’re all on the same page this year —
there are no people who are upset about cer-
tain things,” Smith said. “Everyone’s here to
win, and I think that’s the biggest difference
from every other year. None of us, in any
class, have been to the SoCon finals. That’s a
really big motivating force.”
