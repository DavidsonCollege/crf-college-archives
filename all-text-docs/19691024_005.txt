That Was The Game That Was

Would you believe that last weekend was the
homecoming that was supposed to be? Well, you bet
ter believe that it’s a good thing that it wasn’t. That's
how poor the game was.

The disappointment started with the trip to Wil-
liamsburg. This year the team only flies to two of
the seven (how did we ever manage to get that many”)
away ball games. We make the rest of the trips by
chartered bus.

The extensive use of chartered buses has been
brought on, | imagine, by the much talked-about
squeeze, on. athletic funds. I: remember that when |
came to school to film some pre-season drills Coach
Tom Couch told the boys at lunch one day to’be sure
and give him their youth fare cards.

| could just see us flying stand-by to Texas
thoughts of the “dirty thirty” and less.came to mind
as | remembered some of the success I've had fiving
that. way.

The trip to Williamsburg was one of those made
by bus. Stand-by might have been better—some of
the team might have been lucky enough not to have
made it to the gamé on time.

After the trip itself things continued to get worse.
We did, after all, have to play. William and Mary
has a big team, and the Indians, as everyone knows,
play run-over-you type of offense. They ran over us
for 300-plus yards. The embarassing thing was that
they continued to run over us in the same way, play
after play.

William and Mary wears uniforms just like the
Green Bay Packers, and -their end sweep was just
about as effective as the Pack’s used to be. They
even stayed on the ground in their late fourth quar-
ter touchdown drive.

Their passing game, however, was a joke. The
W&M head coach was quoted earlier'in the week as
saying that their quarterback, Wes Meeteer, was im-
proving on his passing every week. That’s true—he
now usually gets the ball to his receivers on first
bounce rather than on the roll.

If | understood our plan correctly, the coaches
wanted to get on the board a couple of times early
in the game, so that eVveriimproving Wes Meeteer
would have to throw the ball. As it was they didn’t
have to ‘throw, so we spent the afternoon preparing
for Green Bay, which will be added to the schedule
in the mid 70’s.

Our play wasn’t the only bad thing—it seemed
that everything up there was second rate and nothing
could go right for us. A referee managed to go for
one fake by a William and Mary lineman in about the
same way we went for fakes from Meeteer. When he
saw the player lying on his back, he decided that the
boy somehow must have been clipped. As a result
we lost ball possession,

They even let W&M spend extra time in the
dressing room during half time. When Coach Smith
complained, the answer he got was something like,
“Well, after all it is homecoming.”

| got pushed around too. | had to film on a rickety
wooden platform up above the stands. True to the
nature of our entire performance, the camera broke
during the second half. When I opened it up to try
to repair it, the film started flying out of it just like
in the cartoons. I was on the W&M side of the field,
and everyone started laughing at me. Matter of fact,
they laughed so hard that they missed end sweep
number 53.

After the game I had to go over to the Indian
dressing room to check about geiting some copies
of the film that had been lost. As I milled around in
the midst of blood, sweat, and tears, I heard one
coach commenting to a reporter about the game. I
was amused to hear him talk of how they had played
so poorly and how our fine team had controlled the
game. And after my exposure to the Davidson staff,
I had begun to think the era of the dumb football
- coach had come to an end.

After getting dressed the boys piled on the bus
for the trip home. Ask any of them if the easiest
travel on earth is with Trailways. They were pretty
tired, somewhat disappointed, but glad to get out of
Williamsburg—not only just to get out, but to get
out alive with another victory. ‘We're 5-0, but we’re
pitiful,” said one coach. Maybe so, but we are after
all.5-0, and this is the year the Mets went all the way.
Ticker tape anyone?

Face Rugged Schedule

By KEN- JONES
Sports Writer

Although the Davidson rug
by club has yet to win a
match, the outlook and the
appearance of the team are
brighter than ever accord
ing to captain Zack Mobley

“We are in better shape
physically and our fundamen
tals have improved greatly
this fall,"" said Mobley, one
of the founders of the David
son club.» “The tackling” is
improved: and the contact is
getting rougher.”

Despite the reugher prac
tices the injuries which side
lined several starters last
spring have put out only one
regular this season.

The new look in appearance
is the new set of jersies
which the team received last
week after a seven month
wait. The players are paying
the cost of nine dollars for
each while the team tries
to solve its fiscal problems.

Last year the team
turned down in their appeal
for funds from the athletic
department, but received a
$350 grant from the Union
fund. Of that $350
$200 has been re
ceived to date,

Mobley singled out David

Shipp, Wildkittens Topple

Evans For Second Victory

By DICK DOWNEY
Sports Writer

Last Friday the Davidson
Wildkittens triumphed over
Evans Business College, an
obscure little school, by the
seemingly decisive score of
21-8.

However, Coach Gene Mc-
Ever confided that his
charges were lucky to win
because Evans had control
of the ball during most of
the game. In fact, Evans ran
71 plays compared to David-
son's 52 plays.

McEver said that the Wild-
kittens ‘‘just weren't built
up for the game like they
were for Richmond; and to
make matters worse, Evans
had a better team than we
thought they would.”

Considering the score, an
unattached observer would
find it hard to believe that
Evans’ total offensive yard-
age was 303 yards, compar-
ed to only 206 yards for
Davidson. -The difference in
the game was the Wildkitten
defensive unit, which stop-

ped Evans in several clutch
situations. In fact, Evans
didn't score their lone touch-
down until the final quarter.

‘McEver cited several de-
fensive players for outstand-
ing work in the game.
Among them were Bill Gar-
rett, a defensive guard; Jim-
my Hardison, Michael Sikes,
and David Mims, all line
backers; and Greg McCall,
a defensive back. Mims, pro-

bably the smallést™tan* on

the defensive team, is also
one of the most aggressive
members of the Wildkittns.

The outstanding offensive
players were undoubtedly
quarterback Scotty Shipp and
end Andy Davis. Shipp pas-
sed 25 times with 10 com-

pletions and one 2l-yard
touchdown strike to Greg
Cameron. Shipp's favorite
target was Davis, who
caught five passes for 61
yards.

Davis has great potential
to be an outstanding end or
even a back for the varsity
in the coming years, accord-

“Humber ore punter

ing to McEwer.

McEver was highest in his
praise of quarterback Shipp;
he said that if Shipp continu-
ed to improve, he could pos-
sibly be the starting signal
caller next year for the Wild-
cats. As for Shipp's punting
game, McEver said that he
“was already up. there with
the big boys."’ Shipp is aver-
aging about 45 yards, and
will probably be Davidson's
next
year.
