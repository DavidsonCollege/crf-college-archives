Dr. J. H. Cockburn, left, who this week completed the Otts Lecture series is pictured above with
Dr. Chalmers Davidson, college librarian and noted Southern novelist. The two are shown in con.
versation following a tour of the Davidson College library by the two scholars. Dr. Cockburn, who ar-
rived in the United States, only last week, plans to spend three months in this country, visiting points of

interest and lecturing mainly in

the Southern states.

COCKBURN SAYS U. 5. “OPENLY FRIENDLY;”
FINDS AMERICAN STUDENTS “LESS MATURE”

Having amiably agreed to the
taking of several newspapery pho-
tos, he settled his big six-foot-five
frame down into a seat and pre-
sented himself for quizzing. His
white hair grew almost in the

* shape of a wig and his half-squint.
ing eyes looked from right to left
as he talked. Who’s Who lists this
learned Scot as “The Very Rever-
end James Hutchinson Cockburn.”
It also announces he is Director
of the Council for Reconstruction
and Inter-Church Aid of the World
Council of Churches. When off
duty as Chaplain to King George,
he serves in the capacity of re-
tired minister at the Cathedral of
Dunbane, Scotland.

“Your people exhibit much more
warm friendliness in their demon.
strations than mine,” he mused
when asked to compare Yanks and
Scots. “We do not get as excited
as you Americans and have a ten-
dency to take things more in our
stride.”

Dr. Cockburn thought that Eng-
lish college students are much more
mature than those in America.
They are from a more select group
due to a smaller number of col-
leges there. Summarizing his brief
look at our student body, he said

that he had never met with so
warm and cordial a reception and
was “greatly encouraged.” Another
of his thoughts on education here
in the U. S. was that the best of
our colleges compared favorably
with those of England.

When asked about various cur-
rent events, he crushed a cigarette
and launched vigorously into a
discussion of the emminence of
World War III. “My people,” he
exclaimed, “know- there is no such
thing as a preventive war.” In
their typically staid manner, the
Scots are going ahead with cool

heads and continue to believe that.

an open and world-wide conflict
is not “inevitable.”

The Scots join with all England,
it seems. in renouncing socialism.

r“It is especially unbearable in the

fields of coal mining, electricity,
steel production and medicine.”
In relation to the standard of
living in Scotland, the average
family’s income is ‘not far from
that in this country. “Dockworkers
and laborers in general often draw
much more than preachers over
there, too." Dr. Cockburn was
quick to assert the fact that the
Scot’s idea of “success” is much
humbler than that of the American.

“Our churches adhere more to
the established trends in worship
services than yours. You people
are much keener on attending
church than ours and your services
are more psychologically moving,”
he explained.

He was triumphant in claiming
that the BBC programs are “very
much more educational than those
of the U. S. commercial radio.”

Commenting on sectional differ-
ences among American peoples, Dr.
Cockburn thought southerners were
more “homogenious than _ their
northern neighbors. “You are more
leisurely and manage to escape
many of the tensions of northern-
ers.”

Mrs. Cockburn then entered the
room and conversation saying how
impressed she was by the variety
of colors in the student body as-
sembly. “English boys dress so
much more drably, wearing browns
and blues to excess.”

Dr. Cockburn plans to continue
his present tour of the country
which will take him through the
eastern states. Eventually he. will
return to his native soil to com-
plete a history of Dubane Cath-
edral which has been his* ambition
for many years.

H. L. Smith, Former Davidson Pres.
And X-Ray Pioneer in South, Dies

On February 21 in chapel Dr.
Cunningham announced the passing
of Dr. Henry Lewis Smith former
president of Davidson College and
more recently president of Wash.
ington and Lee.

Dr. Smith is well remembered by
those members of the community
who were here during his tenure
of office as an energetic and bril-
liant personality.

Born in Greensboro July 30, 1859,
Dr. Smith was the son of a Pres-
byterian minister, Rev. Jacob H.
Smith. After attending public school
in Greensboro, he became a student
at Davidson where he graduated in
1881 with an A.B. degree. Upon
receiving his M. A. degree from
Davidson in 1886, Dr. Smith was
elected professor of physics and
astronomy. While serving in this
position he became the first to
organize laboratory work for stu-
dents in physics and geology. Not
long afterward he was elected vice-
president of the college.

The attention of the medical pro-
fession was centered upon Dr.
Smith when in 1895 he took the
first X-ray photo south of Balti-
more and shortly after became the
first to use X.ray procedure ir
surgical work. Having attained his
Ph.D. at the University of Virginia
in 1891, Dr. Smith in 1901, at the
urgent request of his predecessor,

Dr. John B. Shearer, was elected
president of Davidson College.
During his administration the stu-
dent body increased from 122 to

NOTICE

On March 9 men of David-
son are asked to show their ap-
preciation for the privilege of
living as civilians. The Red
Cross Bloodmobile will be at

tions of blood Can we pass this
chance to offer materia] aid to
American soldiers? They need
blood to live.

Recently the Davidson Li-
brary received a letter from
Dr. Charles G. Reigner = in
which Dr. Reigner stated that
$500 will be sent each year
to the library to purchase
books. The library has already
received the first $500. and the
Library Committee has been
at work on lists of books to
be published from this fund.

Dr. Reigner is president of
the H. M. Rowe publishing
company of Baltimore, Mary-
land and is author of many
books for the use of students
of Business Administration. A
Presbyterian Dr. Reigner is a
member of the board of mana-
gers of the Maryland Bible So-
ciety. Mr. Reigner is also ac-
tive in civic and business or-
ganizations.

In his letter notifying the
library of his donation Dr.
Reigner states: “I should like
to have the books which will
be purchased to have “cohe-
sion, that js, to be in a field
or fields of Christian educa.
tion that would have some bear-
ing on the work of boys who
are preparing to enter the
Seminary.” A factor which in-
fluenced Dr. Reigner’ in mak-
ing this request is the fact
that one of his six children is
a Presbyterian minister.

In the books purchased by
Mr. Reigner’s gift a special
book plate will be placed. The
book plate .will include the
Peter S. Ney seal of the Col-
lege and “The Charles G.
Reigner collection.” These
books will eventually be
stamped on the cover “Charles
G. Reigner Collection.” An
order has been placed for ap-
proximately 200 books to be
purchased with this year’s gift.
These books shwnld be ready
for circulation in less than a
month.

Besides the donation: to the
Davidson Library, Dr. Reign.
er has presented collections of
books to: The Library of Un-
ion Theological’ Seminary,
Richmond, Va., West Balti-
more General Hospital; School
of Christian Education, Prince-
ton University, N. J.; Prince-
ton Theological Seminary; and

brary.

PLANS FOR AQUATIC.
CLUB ARE DISCUSSED

Thirteen varsity swimmers met with Coach Dick Redding Tuesday night in Davidson’s
Johnston Gymnasium for the purpose of forming an aquatic club. Such a club's general aim
would be to ‘‘promote interest and excellence in swimming and water sports’’ on the cam-

pus.” It was thought that this club could participate in other campus activities such as prop-

erly conducting inter-fraternity swimming meeets, producing a water show in conjunction

Representing Davidson College
in the annual All Southern Debate
Tournament Carlisle Crenshaw,
Hubert Cannon on the Affirmative
team; and Buddy Lamon and Shel-
ley Beard ‘on the Negative team
returned from Atlanta with a ree-
ord of seven wins and seven de.
feats. The tournament was held
February 23-24 on the campus of
Agnes Scott College with approxi-
mately eighteen schools present.

The first round of debating be-
gan at 12:30 Saturday with two
other ruunds ending at 5:30. After
dinner an informal reception was
held in Murray-Candler Hall for
the visiting teams. Saturday morn-
ing the fourth and fifth rounds were
held beginning at 9:00 o'clock. Af-
ter the final two rounds beginning
at 2:00 and cnding at 5:30 a ban-
quet was held in the Agnes Scott
dining hall to present the awards.

The tournament was run on a
point basis with each team getting
a certain number of points for its
initial yictory: and for each win
thereafter the points of the defeat-
ed team were added to the winners
score, After each round the judges’
ballots were noted and for the next
roynd winners were paired with
winners and losers with losers. »

This year the debate topic is Re-
solved: That the Non.Communist
Nations showd forin a new inter-
national organization. In defending
this query the affirmative team won
four out of seven debates while the
negative wan three out of seven.

This is the third tournament that
the debate team has entered this
year, The other two being at Se.

bana. The records for these were

with Queens College and influenc-
ing outstanding prep and high
school swimmers to attend Da-
vidson.

Men desiring to enter the aquat.
ic club would probably be required
to pass certain swimming tests. For
those men unable to swim well
and interested in the managerial
side of swimming, it is thought that
a stringent written test would be
provided. This would probably in-
clude: the knowledge. of timing a
swimming meet and similar details
relevant to the technical end of
swimming. .

Immediate plans were made to
sectire the job of conducting the
forthcoming inter-fraternity swim-
ming meet. As the first members of
this. club would be those men who
swam for this year's varsity, it was’
thought they would be more cap-
able officials than students with less
experience.

It was decided that for the club
to function properly and have long
life, orily men who showed espec-
ial interest not only in joining, but
in swimming itself would be ad-
mitted by the three-fourths vote
required. Diligent application to pas-
sing the tests would be the other
entrance requirement.

Five men were named to a com-
mittee which will draft a constitu-
tion this week and present it to the
charter members. Copies from other
schools having similar clubs are-to
be obtained to aid this group in
their work.

To maintain interest in the club
considered of paramount impor-
tance by the charter members. A
provision like that of the “D” Club
for dropping any man who missed
a specific number of meetings was
to he included in the constitution.

Several men suggested that en-
trance tests be based around those
set up by the American Red Cross
for swimming and life-saving.

Blythe To Retire As 29th Year Approaches

Sunday’s Charlotic Observer ; son College’
revealed the First published no-
i]

tice of the resignation of Pro-
fessor Fred Leroy Blythe from
the Davidson faculty to be ef-
fective at the conclusion of this
semester, In his twenty-cight
years‘ of service to the school
and the community, Prof.
Blythe has endeared himself to
the hearts of all those who have

come into contact with him, and
his absence will be sorely felt by
both faculty and students alike.
“But,” according to Prof. Blythe,
“You can't teach all your life,” so
he plans now to just sit back and.
enjoy life, gaining a much-deserved
rest from a busy lifetime of learn-
ing and teaching in the field of
foreign languages.

Born and raised near Hungers-
ville, Prof. Blythe attended David-

from which he received

the B. A. degree in 1907. While

n Davidson, he studied Latin for

piece was printed in the Tues-
day ‘issue of the U. N. C.
Daily Tar Heel. It was written
by Chuék Houser, one of the
paper’s regular columnists.)

The heap and I heeded Horace
Greely on Friday to the extent of
tanking up and striking off to the
west. Destination: Davidson Col-
lege in the beautiful rolling coun-
try of Mecklenburg County.

Davidson is a Presbyterian school
with around 800 students; an
extremely pretty campus, and a
fine reputation which it lives up to
in every respect. -

More than half of the Davidson
student body (which includes only
men) is majoring in business. The
next largest groups of majors are
pre-ministerial and pre-medicine,
with a number of students work-
ing in history, English, and the

sciences,

The college has a large endow-
ment which sets tuition fees at
$375 per year, plus $85 incidental
fees, $125 room (all students live in
dormitories) and about $350 board
for those students who eat in the
college dining hall.

I got much of my information
on the student life at Davidson
from Pat McGeachy (he pronoun-
ces it McGEH-hee), a pre-minister-
ial senior who serves as a tempor-
ary preacher in a little church out-
side Charlotte on Sundays, sings
a wonderful bass, and plays a fine
guitar. Pat, or “Geech” as he is
known to many on the campus, also
writes a column for The David-
sonian, and does Lord knows what
else around the campus.

Pat and L sitting in a bull ses-
sion with several other students
from both Davidson and Carolina,
dug deep into the Honor System

as it operates at Davidson.

“It really works here,” Pat said
emphatically, and 1 asked him in
what way and how he could tell.

“The Student Council,” Pat ex-
plained, “serves as a court for try-
ing violators of the Honor System.
But it hasn't expelled but one stu-
dent to my knowledge in the last
four or five years. When a student
is expelled, Dr. Cunningham (Da-
vidson's president) tells the student
body about it in chapel meeting
without revealing the name of the
person involved. Of course, with a
student body as smail as ours,
everybody knows who Dr. Cunning-
ham is talking about before he’s
through speaking.”

Except for a few old professors
“who have been here so long they
just can’t get out of the habit,”
he profs leave the room during
quizzes and exams just as ours do
here under the Honor System, Pat

told me.

There are 11 fraternities at Da-
vidson, each occupying a house built
by the college so as to make them
reasonably equal in size and looks.
Furnishings are up to the indivj-
dual chapters, however, I don’t be.
lieve I saw a house there that didn’t
have a TV set.

Fraternity men neither live nor
eat in their houses. They must live
in dormitories, and most of the
houses run dining halls out in town
where the members eat. The houses
are used for relaxation, social gath-
erings, and chapter mectings.

Being a church school (although
religion is not a dominant part of
campus life, the entire student body
attends a 25 minute chapel pro-
gram each morning), Davidson
naturally has some rules which
would be frowned on by. typical
Carolina men.

Students at Davidson, if they

the campus, and a study is now
being made by the Student Council
as to just what constitutes gamb-
ling and what does not. Some
Council members admit that thev
make a bet on a football game now
and then, themselves.

Social organizations are limited
as to the number of fusictions they
may have off campus during a
given year, and on campus, rules
set 4 3 a. m. curfew on women
being in fraternity houses. Prior to
3 a. m. no woman can be in a
house without the presence of at
least one other woman, and: mini-
min requirement of lights must
be kept turned on.

IT dcen’t intend to transfer my.
self, but it’s a wonderful school, in
spite of its rules and restrictions.

four years, taking also Greek and
French, Since Spanish was not in-
cluded in the curriculum, Blythe
‘and two other persons received
tutoring in a special summer school °
course which crammed a full year's
work into three weeks. From Da.
vidson, he went to the University of
N. C. where he received the M.A.
degree in Latin, and following this
le went to Columbia University to
furiher pursue his studies in Span-
ish, After a five weeks Spanish
couse there, which gave him a
total of eight weeks of Spanish all
told, he begafi teaching the course
in high and prep schools. He pur-
sued his studies in that language
for two more summers at Columbia,
then went to the University of Chi-
cago for two summers, and back
to the Old North State at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina for an-
other ‘summer's work. The next
suminer he attended the University
of Virginia, then spent. other sum.

America, Cuba, and other Latin-
“‘imerican countries, attending the
National University of Madrid and
other famous Latin - American
schools

Between summers, Prof. Blythe

and Preparatory Schools of the
Carolinas, coming to Davidson for
two years in-between as a professor
of Latin and Greek. rrom David-
son, he taught at Bailey Prepara.
tory School in Greenwood, S. C.
[In 1923 he returned to Davidson
where he has remained for the past
twenty-eight years.

Professor Blythe loves to talk
at length about athletics — any
phase of athletics from croquet to
cricket. His love for,. baseball,
especially, stems from his college
days when he was an outstanding
member of Davidson’s team. He
goes to every game he possibly
can and claims the Philadelphia
Aubletics as his favorite big-league
team. He played a great deal of
baseball in and around Gastonia,
