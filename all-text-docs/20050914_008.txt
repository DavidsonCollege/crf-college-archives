DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

We took this issue pass/fail

Loving It,’ or. ULI, a group that
abstained from all First and
Second Night Down events
because they have made the deci-
sion to wait until Self Selection
night to attend a Patterson Court
party.

Most of the members can be
seen wearing “promise rings”
around campus, which symbolize
their commitment to a fraternity
and eating house-free lifestyle.

The 45 students who formed
ULI are part of a growing number
of young people in this country
interested in preserving conserva-
tive values rather than succumbing
to adolescent desires or peer pres-
sure.

Religion does not necessarily
forbid the joining of fraternities or
social groups, but many in ULI feel
that some biblical themes are
applicable in this situation. Just as
Moses preached against following

they meet their “special match.”
Promise rings typically represent a
commitment to abstinence from

ed this practice to show the group’s
unity, and commitment to “staying
up.”

Brown said,
“Everyone was asking
everyone else about
which parties they
were planning on
going to, when I even-
tually got up the nerve
to ask if anyone else
felt uncomfortable
about heading down
to the Court already.”

Brown said many of his class-
mates shared his feelings, and over

half of the people on his hall joined _

in his decision to skip all First
Night Down functions this year.
“We've only been here for two
weeks,” Brown said. “I’m not will-

CAMPUS SAFETY

Davidson Campus Police have
always been concerned with stu-
dents safety at Patterson Court
especially, and social gatherings in
general.

A flurry of email warnings
against using fake identifications
to purchase alcohol or reiterating
the consequences of driving while
intoxicated usually accompany the
big party weekends here on cam-
pus. Davidson 101, defense against
rape classes, the night phones all
over campus, and regular patrols
also help to ensure that students
feel and are secure.

This year, Campus Police Chief
James Mitchell added another pre-
ventative measure for First and
Second Night Down. In the mail-
boxes of first-year female students
last Thursday was a small stapled
pamphlet labeled “Guys to Avoid.”
Contained within the 10 pages are

Along with the names, photos,
and class years of these sketchy
men at Davidson, Mitchell and the
other authors of the pamphlet
included information about the
residence, fraternity, and favorite
pick-up lines of each student. The
first two pages were labeled in bold
as “Seriously Sketchy,” denoting

ers particularly dangerous to the
chastity of freshmen.

Jenna Thomas ’09 was very
happy to receive the pamphlet in
her mail. “I had a friend from my
high school who was a freshman
two years ago; she said that First

changed the subject.”

Similar stories abound among
upperclassmen about their first-
year experience. Thomas, howev-
er, was proud to break from the
mold and end up alone in bed
Saturday morning. “I rolled over
and looked at my clock, then at my
roommate’s bed, where multiple
pairs of underwear were still scat-
tered over the covers and some-
thing with a beard was snoring,
and I felt so glad I had read that
pamphlet.”

. Some students are less than
pleased with Campus Police’s
effort, however. Rob Whiteman
’07, who was one of the subjects of
the pamphlet, spoke out loudly

the rest of my time at Davidson.
Just because I have a guitar in my

room. but can’t play it, or know

romantic lines from ‘The
Notebook’ even though I hate that
movie, I could end up being the
guy that all the girls run away from

is about.”

The Davidsonian

If you thought that First Night
Down seemed a little less crowded
this year, you were right. A num-
ber of first-year students have
formed a club called ‘Up and

about the eating houses. We’re just
not ready.”

The group, sporting silver bands
on their right ring fingers, have a
pact not to attend any Patterson
Court function until they pick a
house for good on Self Selection

“Ll want my first
time to he special
.. | want to get
drunk in a frat
hasement because
I've built a special
bond with the

people there.”

sis oecd a  eaea|
night in the spring. They feel that if
the fraternities and eating houses
want them to join badly enough,
then they should be willing to wait~
until the students are ready to
come down.

“It’s just more memorable that
way,” said ULI treasurer Sandy
O'Callahan ’og. “I want my first
time to be special. I don’t want to
feel like some stupid girl who just
got drunk in a fraternity basement
because everyone else was doing it.
I want to get drunk in a fraternity
basement because I’ve built a spe-
cial bond with the people there. I
want to know that the person hold-
ing the bag of wine over my head is
my friend, not just some stranger.”

Some Up and Loving It mem-
bers could not resist the tempta-
tion, and enjoyed the Patterson
Court festivities prematurely
despite their membership.

“I just couldn’t help myself,”
said Heather Sebastian ’o9. “I was
going to visit my big brother in
Knox and just sort of got sucked
into the Court. I feel terrible, but at
the time it felt so natural. My mind
was saying no, but my body was
saying yes.”

The organization was swift to
oust and distance themselves from
the members who had failed their
in their commitment.

“We were able to tell which
members had broken their prom-
ise at our Sunday meeting by the
blue Patterson Court stamps on
their hand,” said Brown. “Some
defectors were even wearing the
same clothes we saw them wearing
the day before.”

Although you cannot be brought
up on Honor Code charges for
breaking your oath to refrain from
down the hill activities, ULI pun-
ishes any premature partiers in a
unique way.

The nine ostracized freshman
lost all membership privileges and
were forced to wear a scarlet First

- Night Down t-shirt of the fraterni-

ty or eating house ae party
they visited.
