The Death Of Segregation

. Racial segregation at Davidson Col-
lege died a sudden, strange, ironic
death last Wednesday..

It was almost two years exactly
from the day when the trustees
laconically stated that it was not in
the best interests of Davidson College
to admit Negroes at that time.

In a release very nearly as terse as
the famous “best interests” state-
ment, the trustees announced that
the college would now be willing to
admit up to three qualified Congolese
students.

This was a major breakthrough for
a working Christianity in a Christian
institution. But we cannot help won-
dering at the paradox here. Why
should Davidson accept three Ne-
groes at the request of the Board of
World Missions when our own Gen-
eral Assembly made a plea for edu-
cational equality seven years ago?

Upon first thought, it seems easier
this way. In Only in America Harry
Golden tells a story about a Pitts-
burgh Negro who made a tour of the
South wearing a turban. He was wel-
comed into the most exclusive hotels
and in one Deep Southern city a

ladies’ society sent him flowers and
asked him to make a speech. Some-
how, a foreign Nigger is a little dif-
ferent from a Mecklenburg County
Nigger.

But will it be easier? These young
Congolese will not likely come wear-
ing turbans. But they may come with
a deep, bitter taste of aparthied in
their mouths. They may be surprised
that the community which has ac-
cepted them as educational equals
does not always accept them as social
equals. They may not care to buy
their cheese crackers at the soda
shop and then get out. They may balk
at sitting in the balcony with a bunch
of beered-up young bucks at the Sat-
urday night movie in Mooresville.

More than arguments against ad-
mitting the Congolese, these consid-
erations are challenges to make the
admittance of the Congolese work.

From the standpoint of personal
relations, we feel that the trustees
were wrong if they assumed that it
is going to be easier this way.

They were right, however, in real-
izing that something had to be done.

A Plan For Underachievers

Last week Dean John C. Bailey
stated flatly that there is no program
or policy for combatting “under-
achievement” at Davidson College.
His statement was made in response
to a “growing student misconcep-
tion.”

Those ugly rumors will get around.

It scared a good many people who
are frankly, unabashedly review-
divers and spot box addicts.

Why isn’t there a program for the
underachievers? In recent issues, this
newspaper has criticized Davidson’s
administration for what we feel are
severe inadequacies in several de-
partments of the faculty.

But education. is a two-way propo-
sition. In a speech last spring, Presi-
dent D. Grier Martin said, “. . . it is
almost impossible to make a distinc-
tion in importance between faculty
and students because neither is of
value without the other.”

What is an underachiever? It's a
student who racked up 520-plus

scores on the college board but can't

A Challenge To

make his grades for fraternity initia-
tion. It’s a merit scholar who slides
along with a C average. These peo-
ple negate good professors; they are
a drag on the college’s academic
progress.

All of us underachieve a little. No-
body puts out 100 per cent all the
time. But the underavhievers are
chronic—they are addicted to lazi-
ness, stricken by spring fever twelve
months a year.

Dean Bailey said that although
there is no systematic program for
underachievers, “the idea ‘is sound
and must be studied carefully.”

Dr. George L. Abernethy once sug-
gested that students suspected of
underachieving be asked to defend
their right to remain at Davidson
College. This could be done both
orally and in essay form.

Dr. Abernethy’s idea would be a
good start on a bold plan. The ugly
rumor could become reality.

We think it would be a good thing.

The College

“It is time that we hed uncommon schools, that we
did not leave off our education when we begin to be
men and women. it is time that villages were univer-

sities...” Henry Devid Thoreau

One often hears, particularly at
commencement, the admonition: Your
education should not come to a halt

with your graduation from college.”
Certainly everyone recognizes that
this advice carries an important mes-
sage for the individual, yet it ger
haps can also set forth a great .
lenge to the college itself.
Presently, the Davidson student
undergoes a metamorphosis
upen graduati e ceases to be
the student and assumes the rele of

graduate accepts the responsi of
supporting the college, financially
and otherwise. :

It seems to us, however, that per-
haps two responsibilities are being
dodged. One is the college's responsi-
bility to stimulate a continued in-
tellectual relationship between the
college and the alumnus. The other
is the graduate’s responsibility to
maintain an intellectual inquisitive-
ness in spite of the fact that he is
now removed from the core of his
intellectual background—the college.

At present, Davidson is experi-
menting with a brand-new “Alumni
College” plan in the spring. It has
been ly successful for those who

have attended—but attendance has
been limited to less than 100 and
most of these alumni students were,

by necessity, men from the surround-
ing area.
here is a better way of reaching
alumni. This is through the Alumn)
Journal, a magazine usually devoted
to a feature or two, a skort report on
the faculty and administration, a
word from President Martin and
chatty notes on alumni.
We feel that perhaps the Alumni
Journal could be filled with material
that is a little mere meaningful. Why

net include ts from seme of
the most ou £ hes, talks
and sermons deliv here? Why

not ask feculty members to debate
controv issues and report on
new development in their fields that
might interest the layman?

Furthermore, why not extend a
more insistent, more meaningful in-
vitation to alumni to return to the
college for attractions like the Book-
of-the-Year program and the Great
Issues discussions?

These measures could not help
being good public relations.

The situation calls merely for a
simple recognition of the challenge,
not a dramatic revision of the col-
lege’s philosophy of education. The
resources are close at hand.

Davidson has to a degree recog-
nized the challenge, but it has not,
as far as we can see, set it forth as
a goal of the college. TBC

LETTERS TO THE EDITORS

Tom Parker Attacks
Integration Coverage

Dear Editor,

Two years ago the David-
son student body, assembled
in chapel, applauded the
statement “It is not in the
best interest of Davidson
College to admit Negroes
at this time.” Last year,
through a clearly worded pe-
tition, they expressed their
desire that Davidson remain
a segregated institution at
least for the present tme.

Despite these setbacks,
those on this campus who
favor integration have re-
newed their efforts
to achieve that end. In the
face of these renewed ef-
forts, it is interesting to con-
sider the devices which they
employ to gain their objec-
tives. especially those
which are used in an open-
ly sympathetic newspaper
(which nonetheless declares
itself in its letterhead to be
“The News and_ Editorial
Voice of Davidson College”).

FIRST DEVICE

The first of these devices.
attempted character assassi-
nation, is perhaps the most
reprehensible. The trustees
have taken a stand against
integration.

It is therefore pointed out
that one trustee doesn't
know the correct name of
the main college building:
another is not aware of the
fact that students attend
ebape! three times a week:
and allegedly a third, though

he receives the school news-
paper every week, does not

know either its correct name.

or that of the young man
whose articles criticizing
him are published in it.
The implication is clear:
If these men are ignorant of
such important details as
these, how can they be ex-
pected to reach a sound de-
cision on the race question?
A personal attack does not
refute a man’s stated opin-
ion, but this seems to be an
acceptable practice here.

SECOND DEVICE

A second popular device is
the play on words. In sup-
posedly objective articles,
integration and those con-
nected with this movement
are “courageous,” “fair
play.” “higher law,” and
“(cause which is) worthy of
our all.”

Those who favor segrega-
tion, and their arguments,
are “irrelevant;” “morally
wrong,” “evil,” “injustice,”
and “unloving and narrow.”
The actions of the integra-
tionists are “in keeping with
the best ideals of liberal ed-
ucaton”: segregationists are
‘unwilling to face the is-
sues,”

CHRISTIANITY
Next is the much publ-
icized idea which equates in-
tegration with Christianity.
Many men who are devout
and fundamental in their be-
liefs prefer segregation, but

the integrationists have suc-
cessfully succeeded in iden-
tifying their position with
the true practice of the
Christian ideal.

The fact that Davidson is
segregated “is a major cause
of our (the Davidson stu-
dents’) disillusionment with
the Christian faith’; if we
still profess to be Chris-
tians, “our Christianity (is)
exposed as a mockery.”

This list includes the use
of half-truths as fact, as
when integration at the Uni-
versity of Georgia, executed
under court order, is hailed
as an example of the break-
down of Jim Crow barriers
due to the effect of ‘“con-
science.”

“STAND IN”

Sympathetically written
news stories, such as the
one about the “stand-in” in
Charlotte, are on the front
page of the paper which is,
as I have said, supposed to
be “The News and Editorial
Voice of Davidson College.”

I am not here attempting
to condemn either the seg-
regationist or integrationist
positions. What I am trying
to say is this: It’s good to
fight for something in which
you sincerely believe. But
there's also an deal known
as responsibile journalism,
so let’s keep the fighting on
the up-and-up.

Ackerman Slams
Scripts ’n Pranks

Dear Ekiter,

Of feuor publications es
campus this year; THE
DAVIDSONIAN, ‘The Wild.
cat Handbook,” “The Stu-
deat Regulations Beok,” and
the ‘ ‘n Pranks,” only
the latter bas failed to rep-
resent Davidson and its stu-
dent body creditably.

It might be called tax-
ation without representation,
for students “giving” money
through the activities fee
are not aware that from thie
fund the “Scripts ’n Pranks”
magazine is financially boro.

I wonder how long the
publication would remain in
its present state if it were
forced to rely on voluntary
subscriptions for its finan-
cial support. Under the pres-
ent system of compulsory
subscription, it seems to me
that stddents should have
something to say about its
quality, good or BAD.

COULD B88 GOOD

Don’t get me wrong. I
think the “Scripts ‘n
Pranks,” as designed to pub-
lish good scripts along with
master pranks, could be an
exceptionally good and es-
sential activity of the col-
lege. What bothers me is
that there is no way in
which this Davidson institu-
tion can be forced to re-
vamp itself, although the
magazine has failed to live

up to its own celf-made mis-
imum dandards.

Maybe there words are tee
bareh, but let me emphasise
what ene student said, that
“the lest issue of the S and
P was a peor way of ad-
vertising the fact that Da-
videon has no imaginative
clowas or serious. writers.”
This is not merely the opin-
jon of one student but ie, I
think, the feeling of the ma-
jority of the student body.

It seems that students can
buy PLAYBOY, its counter-
part, for less money and get
better jokes, pictures, and
clothes ads than the S ‘an P
has given in Vol. XVI, No. 2.
Unfortunately, original hu.
mor cannot be had in this
latter magazine without
being pregnant with sex,
predictable intimations, and
vulgarity.

APOLOGIZE
More unfortunately, good
jokes can be had only
through the grape vine. Or

Hs contents, eriginal or ber-

rowed.

Sadly enough, what is
printed in the S ‘a P is
broadcast to the townspeo-
ple and to other townspeo-
ple as the best of Davidson
student literary effort.

As the situation stands
now, I suggest thet the April
issue be published in French
or German or Hebrew in or-
der to put a little intellec-
tualism into our magazine
along with the ubiquitous
Rush Wilsen ads.

At any rate, the caliber of
material that pervades the
ink-stained pages of S and P
should climb out of its
“dung heap’—not just to
the level of the Chamber-
maids, but to that of the
Davidson student.

Focus
Duggan: “Dr. Frank”
ls A Man Of Courage

Frank Porter Graham, a small.and modest man
came among us, impressed us, miade us ashamed, lef
us wondering what about the man accounts for his

influence. ;
What can we call the quality that marks the man?

Call it simplicity. ;

Call it honesty, or humtlity, or goodness.

Or call it eloquence, as you hear him speak of
his America:

“The ideals of the American Revolution heve
gone around the world, have come home agein and
surely will not be renounced in the house of their
fathers... (they have gone ringing around the world
and down the centuries and are still singing in the
hearts of the people.”

Call it courage, the courage to stand fast when
his idealism was attacked as subversion, the courage
to be patient when he was misunderstood, the courage
to persist and persist. ; , .

Listen to him speaking of America’s migrant
workers, “the most disinherited people in this land
of liberty today,” and call it compassion: .

“.’,. the migrant workers, who with their chil-
dren, in search of work, wander from state to state,
season to season, crop to crop, homeless, rootless,

often defenseless and sometimes hopeless pilgrims
in this historic land of the Pilgrim’s hopes.”

Ask him why he has lived as he has, and hear his
answer:

“J suppose I would participate in any movement
for freedom. 1 think it is better to know you'll be
smeared than to fear you'll be smeared.”

And listen to his views: agree or disapprove, but
call his quality conviction:

- "The American schools and colleges have taught
the Negro youth their heritage as Americans. Amer-
ica in her heart of hearts would not now have these
youth renounce their equal heritage and hopes as
Americans .. . for the Negro youth are, in their
hearts, standing up for the American dream.

“The origin of this movement was not in Moscow
but in Carpenter’s Hall, Philadelphia, and its farther
headwaters are in the hills of Judea where a car-

enter’s son taught the fatherhood of God and the
brotherhood of all people. For this he was willing to
die. For this we should have the will to live and carry
on in His spirit...

“The sacrificial Cross, warm with the blood of
human brotherhood, will triumph over all the fiery
crosses lighted with the hot oil of prejudice, privi-
lege, and power...

“At this critical stage, America must make clear
to herself and the world that the ideals of the Ameri-
can Revolution, the Bill of Rights and the great ju-
dicial decisions for the equal freedom, dignity and
opportunity of all people, are not only the past and
historic but are also the present and living source of
America’s faith in herself, the world’s faith in Amer-
ica, and America’s moral influence for leadership on
the side of . . . a more abundant life for all people
on the earth in this age of mortal peril and immortal
hope for all mankind.”

Frank Graham is not a realist. He is not a “prac-
tical man.”

He is a dreamer, an impractical dreamer who
roves that a soft voice full of conviction is the
loudest voice of all, that the face of strength is a

gentle face.

He is another impractical dreamer who has
changed things, a dreamer who marked the history
of a state.

What is the quality that marks the man?

Call it greatness.
