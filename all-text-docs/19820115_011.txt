Sitting in the old plot
Damn snack bar- -

Where we all pool together |

| Gnawing at ourselves to eat another” sheart-

| will Wills unite?
| Will Live find us’ |
Will time see us this mercy
Before death finds us apaser

A A deep dark blabber
_ Talk, idiots talk
Walk, wall, talk
Girls walking in their slanilered flesh ©
Boys, talking of their balls .
And réatting Aristotle,
-To prepare them- ;

So we can all talk in terse agreement

We're stranger s

(Although we've never met eyes)

We'll talk the same

Of what we already know

And bottle it with coarse laughter

(to prove we both feel)

We laugh, yes. yes. to say
“Please! We do agree, don’t we!”
And shift silently apart. :
People come and people go...

(although we don’t, we say we do

And never really come at all)

We weep inside and never
Leave our fate behind- “4

Just drag it--

In this Snack-Bar

; In this pool, we'll keep trying tobe free,

Alone

i So we can let the wave of ' time

q Rubi us sweetly into the: breast of nothingness

“And die with these shells still intact- |
vA not-so-fagile, lifeless death.
