THE DAVIDSONIAN

Photo Club Designates
Picture Of The Month

The Photo Club has recently an-
nounced the beginning of a semes-
ter-long competition among _ its
members for the selection of a
“Picture of the Month.”

This “Picture of the Month,”
which ic to be selected by Mr.
Hutchi on, instructor of fine arts
at Davidson, and director of the
M'nt }useum in Charlotte, is to be
picked from mounted prints suab-
mitted to him by members of the
Club. One picture is to be selected
each month, during the spring sc-
‘mester, and is to be displayed
(through courtesy of the Adminis-
tration) on the faculty and admin-
istration bulletin board in the south
hall of Chambers building.

No restrictions are to be placed
on subject matter, and the quali-
ties on which prints are to be
judged will be left entirely to the
discretion of Mr, Hutchison.

In .sclecting this monthly com-
petition among its members this
spring as a semester project; the
Photo ‘Club hopes not only to pro-
vide’ the student body with a
glimpse. of the photographic work
which is carried on by some Da-
vidson students, but also to stimu-
late an interest in the taking of,
salon-type pictures. It is hoped
that the competition will be an in-
centive for the taking of better pic-
tures by the Photo Club mem-
bers and for the improvement of
photographic technique by othe:s
in the student body who are inter-
ested in photography.

Full technical data are to be post-
ed with the winning print each
month so that. all may know the
conditions under which the pic-
ture was taken and the equipment
used.

The winning print in the first
month’s competition, entitled
“Morning Mist,” was taken on the
Davidson campus shortly before
Christmas vacation by Charles
Burrus on a foggy Sunday after-

noon.

INFORMAL BIBLE
OLASS

In view of the approaching
exams and the rushed schedule
of students during this period,
the YMCA Bible Class is plan-
ning informal meetings for the
remainder of the semester.
As is the custom, coffee and
doughnuts will be served, be-
ginning at 9:50 p. m.

programs,

“Y’Group Discusses
Racial Relations

The first of a series of meetings
dealings with various relevant
problems took place in the Quad-
rangle Room on January 11 at 8:15
p. m. Sponsored by the YMCA,
the gathering dealt with the ques-
tion of race relations. Special em-
phasis was laid upon the Christian
approach to the Negro-White ques-
tion in the South. .

The principal speaker was the
Reverend Charles M. Jones, pas-
tor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Chapel Hill. In a brief
‘talk he outlined four principles by
which men may gauge their atti-
tudes on race relations. He stress-
ed right motives, broadness of view-
point in all human relations, will-
ingness to go the second mile, and
the imperative quality of Christian
morality.

His principles were discussed and
elaborated upon by a faculty panel
composed of’ Dr. George Aberna-
thy, Dr. Frontis Johnston and Dr.
W. A. McGavock. The discussion
was then opened to questions from
the flour. Charles Davis of the
Senior Class acted as moderator.
Because of the nature of the pro-
gram and the stall room, the fo-
tum was necessarily limited in at-
-endance.

Harvard Otfers Aid

Regional Scholarship program of
the Harvard Graduate School of
Business Administration was an-
nounced last night by Dean Donald
K. David.

a maximum of 55 men entering
the school in September, the Re-
gional Scholarship program is de-
signed to insure “that, well-quali-
fied students without sufficient fi-
nancial resources will be able to
continue their education in the
graduate field of business adminis-
tration.”

lotted its own scholarships under
the plan and recipients are selected
by competition on a regional basis.

Southwestern (five scholarships):
Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico,
Oklahoma and Texas.

Dean David, explained: “The
Graduate School of Business Ad-
ministration has always prided it-
self on keeping its doors open to
men from all economic levels and
from all parts of the country. If the
School is to continue to serve the
nation in the development of lead-
ers to carry business responsibility,
this policy must continue.”

Under the Regional Scholarship
program, the actual amount of thie
award to each scholar will depend
directly on individual financial
need. Selection of men to receive
the scholarship will be made on a
basis of aptitude for business train-
ing, without regard to financial
need. In extreme cases, the schol-
arship may cover the entire cost of
a man’s training for business ad-
ministration.

The Harvard Graduate School
of Business Administration has as
its primary objective the teaining of
men to become responsilte busi-
nessmen: not students of business
nor specialists who know about
business, but men able to work in
business and capable of develop-
ing into responsible executives.

Applicants should write to the
Committee on Scholarships, Har-
vard Graduate School of Business
Administration, Soldiers Field, Bos-
ton 63, Massachusetts for applica-
tion forms and detailed informa-
tion. The deadline for applications
will be April 1, 1950.

MAROH OF DIMES ASKS
HELP OF COLLEGE MEN

An alarming number of people

in age groups that include college

and university students were vic-
tims of 1949s epidemics of polio-
myelitis in this country, Basil O’-
Connor, president ‘of the National
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
declared in issuing a special, ur-
gent call for organized March of
Dimes campaign participation by
college and university student
bodies.

Extensive research and educa-

tional programs are financed by
the March of Dimes funds of the
National Foundation, Mr. O’Con-
nor explained, He added that virus
research seeking a means of pre-
vention or control of poliomyelitis
has cost the National Foundation,
from 1938 and through June 30,
1949 $8,212,855.50 while research
for the prevention and treatment of
after-effects of the disease have
cost another $2,735,223.95.

In urging all-out participation by
colleges and universities in the 1950
March of Dimes, Mr. O’Connor
stressed the importance of unin-
terrupted continuance of the educa-
tional and research programs of
the National Foundation, despite
the added patient-care burdens of
the coming year.

FROSH CAGERS FALL...

Hotshots proved too much for the
frosh as they ran up a 99-43 score.
The game was much more thrilling
than the score would indicate for
the local lads played a hard, fast
game. The score at halftime was
36-16 for the State freshmen.
Crull and Speight led the tall win-
ners with 22 and 21 each. Crull and
Kukoy both tossed in eight field
goals to.lead their mates. Howell
and Asbury with 8 and 7 excelled
for the hosts. It was a rather rough
game in that 51 fouls were called
by the officials. Twenty-nine of

several occasions.

Saturday night. Parker High of

liminary to the McCrary Eagles

be resolved fo accomplish deeds of
everlasting worth. .

What is complete humanity?
When neither of these two essen-
tial aspects is obscured, but each is
asserted and developed; when they
neither destroy each other nor drive
each other to extremes, but blend
in an evident unity replete with in-
ner tension yet firm, imperilled,
yet assured, limited, yet bound on
an infinite voyage, this is a com-
plete humanity; and a man is hu-
man in so far as he lives, con-
sciously, willingly, and with a cheer-
ful promptitude as a finite being in
the midst of time, change, and the
countless shapes of life — but
at the same time strives to over-
come all this flux and limitation in
the eternity and ‘infinity which
transfigures them. A man ‘is hu-
man in so far as he truly and hum-
bly combines these two essential as-
pects. Herein lies the inexpres-
sible charm of all things human —
a mystery pregnant with pain and
strength, desire and confident

hope.”
