Pew grants allow research in
humanities

By MARGARET CARROLL

Davidson College is now ac-
cepting applications from rising
junior and senior humanities ma-
jors who would like to learn more
about the intricacies of scholarly
research through programs spon-
sored by the Pew Memorial Trust.
In 1986 Davidson College was
awarded a grant from the Pew
Memorial Trust to begin new pro-
_ grams which would enhance the
senior year experience for majors
in the Humanities departments.
(English, History, Philosophy,
Religion, Foreign Languages,

Art, Music, and Theater) Among”

other new ‘programs made pos-
sible by the Pew grantis one which
allows students to work during the
summer as a professor’s research
assistant.

Last summer Alison Chapman
and Sally Robinson participated
in the Pew program. Chapman de-
scribes the program as an opportu-

nity for “undergraduates to be ex-
posed to the intricacies and depth
of scholarly reaearch.” Alison,
who worked with Dr. Cynthia
Lewis of the English department,
researched a_pseudo-historical
look at drama in the Elizabethan
era. Chapman conducted her re-
search at the Duke University li-
brary, typed for Dr. Lewis, and
added information to the research
journal.

Chapman enjoyed the program
as a project “done by two people
who share a common love for a
subject and a mutual respect for
each other.” :

Robinson worked with Dr.
David E. Shi of the History depart-

ment in researching an American |

woman artist, Cecelia Beaux.
Robinson searched index head-
ings for relevant articles on Beaux
and photocopied the information
she uncovered. Robinson said that
the project was “great, although

tedious at times.” She was able to
observe how the process of doing
scholarly research operates; origi-
nally Dr. Shi was doing a maga-
zine article on Cecelia Beaux, and
now he has decided to write a book
on the artist.

In order to apply for the Pew
program students should contacta
professor in their major to see if
that professor is interested, and if
so, each should write a one-page
application.. The.student’s appli-

‘ cation should describe his or her

interest in the program, experi-
ence and skills related to the proj-
ect, and should include a tentative
work schedule. (The student may
work for up to ten weeks.)

The student’s stipend is up to
$1800 and can include free on-

campushousing. Applications for

this summer’s program are due by
March 1. Interested students
should contact Dr. Shi, director of
the program (phone ext. 271),

Burglars smash windows at Akers dormitory;

mysterious female robs rooms in Richardson

By TRIPP HELMS

Two incidents of break-in and burglary
took place in the period during and imme-
diately following Christmas break,
Davidson College Public Safcty depart-

ment officials said this week.
Windows were found broken in six Akers
dormitory rooms on December 27 by an
officer of the Public Safety department.
Nothing was officially reported stolen, but
some Akers residents have said that they are
missing small amounts of loose change.

An unrelated string of robberies in
Richardson dormitory took place on Janu-
ary 4. Eight residents reported a total of
over $280 incash missing from their rooms;
a 24-hour bank card and, a necklace were
also stolen.

The broken windows in Akers were dis-
covered by an officer on regular patrol at
9:23 p.m. The police searched the rooms,
and nothing appeared to missing. Chief of
Davidson Security Jackie Hughes surmises
that the perpetrators were “casing the
dorm” and planning to return later with a
vehicle to rob the rooms.

A special patrol was set up to keep watch

on the dorm, and the driveway leading to
the parking lot behind it was secretly
marked so that the police would know if a
vehicle passed through.

No one returned that night; and the win- —

dows were nailed shutso that they could not
be opened even if unlocked through a bro-
ken pane.

“Students leave their
rooms unlocked;

they’re too trusting.”

— Chief Jackie Hughes

Hughes says that Akers dorm is very
vulnerable to break-ins because it is set
back .in the woods and is close to North
Main Street. It is difficult to patrol the area
because police Cushman scooters cannot
ride behind the dorm, Hughes said. An
officer must get out and walk behind the
dorm to check it.

Director of Residence Life Tom Jennings
says that “the installation of security
screens on all first-floor windows is part of
[his] long-range plan.”

Hughes suggested the construction of a
driveway behind Akers, Irwin and Knox
dorms and the placement of asecurity light.

The Richardson robberies of last Monday
were committed by an unidentified female
who was seen wandering on the third and
fourth floors of the dorm. She knocked on
freshman Delia Johnson’s door at about
10:00 a.m. and asked for “Robbie Howell,”
according to Johnson. When she checked
the student directory and did not find a Rob-
bie Howell listed, Johnson called Campus
Security.

Hughes explained that the suspect's
mode of operation was to knock on a door
asking for a fictitious student; if there was
no answer, she would enter the unlocked
room and search for money.

All of the rooms that were hit by the

robber had been left unlocked. This is a
major problem on campus according to
Hughes and Jennings.

“Students leave their rooms unlocked;
they’re too trusting,” says Hughes. Hughes
also. reports that many dorm entrances are
left propped open, rendering their combi-
nation locks useless against trespassers. .

According to Jennings, there is about one
major break-in on campus each year, usu-
ally over the holidays.

During the Christmas holiday in 1986,’
someone broke into the Julia Johnson pe-
rimeter house. Residents returned from
break to find their rooms ransacked and
their doors and windows broken.

Hughes states that the number of inci-
dents of crime on campus is down this year.

There have been 98 reports filed, com-
pared with twice that may incidents re-
ported at this time last year. “We have had
a very good year,” he remarks, “but I’d
better. knock on wood when I say that.”
