Plans Explained
The plan, as previously stated,
is to give Bibles to three causes
connected with the present war.

(1) Bibles will be furnished to the
natives in free China where they
are anxious to have the Bibles. (2)
Bibles will go’ to Geneva for pris-
oners in German concentration
camps. (3) Testaments will be given
to sailors in the United States
Navy. Among these groups there are
many who cannot find a Bible avail-
able.

Davidson’s Y. M. C. A. is carry-
ing out, this project through the
American Bible Society. Sample
copies of Bibles and Testament:
have been sent to the “Y.” The So-
ciety has informed the “Y”
