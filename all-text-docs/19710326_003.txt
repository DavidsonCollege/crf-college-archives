Due -to a. shift in em-
phasis and concern, VISTA
(Volunteers In Service To
America) will be visiting the
Davidson campus Monday
and Tuesday to -recruit per-
spective applicants for the
program.

According to Jenna White-
head, VISTA’s area recruit-
er, VISTA no longer is seek-
ing quantity in their pro-
gram, Rather, quality is be-
ing emphasized, and recruit-
ing is now being done at
smaller, more © selective
schools ‘“‘where such quality
is easier to find.”

Whitehead said that VISTA
expects 25,000 applicants this
year, with around 5,000 be-

A FEATURE

“Hey, how're: ya doin'?"’
he says as you walk some
what uncertainly into the
room, being careful to-make
as much noise as possible to
announce your arrival.

Danny Berry, a _ junior
transfer student from Mary-
ville College, is the second
blind student at Davidson in
forty years, The last one
graduated in 1962.

Danny greets the unseen
intruder with boistrous jovial-
ity, punctuating his speech
with frequent hand guestures
and an ever-present laugh.
He seems to radiate friend-
liness.

Before long, you’re feeling
right at ease, listening to him
explain about his job as
disc jockey for WDAV and
talk about himself and what
he likes to do.

H: Edmunds_ White, ad-
missions director, said that
the office’s main considera-
tion in reviewing Danny’s

ed. Instead he has purchas-
ed ‘‘argood percentage” of
the books ne¢essary in a
“talking. book” form which
is a thin 16 rpm record of a
person reading the book.
When Danny does read in
Braille, he manages to move
along at a 200 word per min-
ute clip--no small feat for

touch reading.

He takes notes for himself
after classes on a_ braille
tvpewriter that has six keys
which can be ‘punched to
form any one of sixty-three
different characters. Danny
takes his tests on a regular
typewriter, usually back in
his room.

“T have never attended .a
school for the blind and
have no desire to do so. Pub-

lic education is what it’s all
about. A lot of blind people
want a separate community,
but I’d rather be a part of

* the real world.”

It seems that for Danny,
as for many other blind men
and women, his blindness is
a challenge to his individual-
ity. ‘‘Blind people don’t want
to be just members of the
blind, community,” he re-
marked with considerable
conwiction.

One constant struggle
Which-he faces stems from
his desire to be evaluated
and accepted as an individ-
ual capable of independent
action, as opposed to his oc-
cassional need for assistance.
He objects to the idea of
help for help’s sake.

“I'd like to think that when
someohe offers to help me,
he is offering aid to-a fel-
low student, not to a blind
person,” he says.

“Being blind helps me in
some ways. I’m_ obviously
not swayed by first impres-
sions due to looks or clothes.

“You can, however, tell a
lot about a person by the
voice — receptiveness, sharp-
ness, openmindedness — with
a pretty high degree of ac-
curacy. It would be fairly
hard to be hypocritical to-
ward me—I hope!”

ing accepted. for the pro-
gram.

“The idealistic, saviouristic
people who. once made up
the program are no longer
being sought,” she pointed
out. “‘Now the emphasis is
on people who have their
heads together, people with
good ideas, awareness to
what’s happening around
them, and experiences with
people that will-give them
a high frustration level.”

Although the program has
begun to emphasize special-
ization among its volunteer
workers, ‘‘a full, sixty per
cent of VISTA is compris-
ed of general volunteers who
come -into the program with-
out any specific talent,”
Whitehead said. ‘‘These gen-
eralists usually good at
community organizing and
self - help programs and
ideas,”

Whitehead said that she

‘doubted that Nixon’s propos-

ed plans to combine VISTA
and the Peace Corps would
be approved” by Congress.
‘There is presently an al-
liance against it, and I feel
the programs will be allow-
ed to remain separate.”

In its nationwide recruit-
ing program, VISTA: is look-
ing for students who prefer-
ably will graduate this spring
or summer. Also, a_ high
lottery number in the draft
is helpful, Whitehead said.
