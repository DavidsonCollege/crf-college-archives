New9-911

system
flawed

‘
By WILL BRADSHAW
Staff Writer

The Davidson College and
town police have switched to the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg 911 sys-
tem from the separate system they
had previously used. This change
has caused confusion for both stu-
dents and police dispatchers.

“It is going to take time for
dispatchers in Charlotte to famil-
iarize themselves with our proce-

dures,” Chief of the Davidson Cok
lege Police Rick Moore says. “They

are not used to responding to a call
for an escort, lockout, or jump start
by sending an officer, and it will
take time for them to realize that
we send an officer for anything.”

What has commonly been hap-
pening is that a student will dial the
new 9-911 number and get a Char-
lotte dispatcher. The dispatcher will
then tell the student that his or her
situation is not an emergency and
that the police only respond to
emergencies.

Moore stressed that if this hap-
pens, the person needs to ask to
speak to a dispatch supervisor and
explain the situation to him, which
should alleviate the problem.

“All dispatch supervisors are
aware that they [students] should
see an officer,” Moore says. “I
have talked to supervisors on sev-
eral occasions, and I have yet to
speak to one who wasn’t polite and
trying to provide a good service.”

There have been no reported
problems in the last week accord-
ing to Moore, but if someone does
run into difficulty for any reason,
the incident should be reported to
the Campus Police.

“There have been less prob-
lems than I expected as new as this
is to dispatchers down there. Allof
a sudden they have many new
things to remember, and they have
shown a willingness to address
problems and provide a good ser-
vice,” Moore says.

Recycling Committee, a division
of Reach Out.

The idea for increased recy-
cling arose out of work done last
semester. The Campus Services

‘and Facilities Committee of the

SGA, in cooperation with the Re-
cycling Committee, brought an
earlier version of the proposal to

the PCC, which approved: the
plan. It was submitted so near
the end of the semester, how-
ever, that action has been de-
layed until now.

In sum, the proposal man-
dates that each fraternity and eat-
ing house make use of three re-
cycling bins, provided by the
SGA, to separate aluminum, plas-
tic, and paper. Each Court house

will be required to bring their
sorted. materials to the shed at
least once a week for processing.
Students have the option of vol-
unteering additional time at the
shed, which needs workers to
sort materials for. pickup.

This is not the end of recy-
cling plans at Davidson. “Recy-
cling has been shooting off in
many different directions here,

and it has never come together...
I think now it will,” says
Robinson.

She hopes a recycling fo-
rum, to be held before the end of
this semester, will lead to an in-
creased number of bins and im-
proved organization. “We’d like
to see each dorm have a place to

recycle all types of materials,”
she adds.

ants complain that while he ne-
glects many of his responsibilities
as a landlord, he also places unfair
restrictions on his tenants.

LANDLORD SERIES

Past residents complain that
when he showed them houses ini-
tially, Case said he would repair
damages. Instead, many say, he
never made the improvements he
promised. As one past resident
said, “ [He says] he’s going to
make this place a wonderful
heaven, but he does nothing.”

According to former tenants,
Case has been equally reluctant to
attend to problems suchas ants and
electrical failures. Past residents
describe his response to these situ-
ations as “very slow,” with some
complaining that it took an unrea-
sonable amount of time for him
even to return their phone calls.

When renters were able to
reach Case, they say he often ex-
cused himself as being too busy to
remedy the situation. Similarly,
several past residents recall Case
as having promised to mow their
lawns for a small fee, yet let the
