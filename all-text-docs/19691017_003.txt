Area Exam Improvement

By NEIL COGHILL
Staff Writer

There will be definite new
developments on the area
examinations question with-
in the next four weeks, said
Registrar Jay H. Ostwalt in
the Open End_ discussion
Monday night. About 25 stip
dents were present. of

The Educational . Policy
Committee meets today to-
consider the recommenda-
tions it has received follow
ing an open meeting with
students Monday afternoon
and a similar one involving

the faculty the previous
week.

Ostwalt outlined three pro-
bable areas of action by the
EPC: (1) some form of psy
chological ‘and academic re
lief from the pressure the
sophomores are now under
in terms of possible alterna
tives, (2)-optional meetings
with representation of the
reading list and _ require-
ments.

Meanwhile, Ostwalt af
firmed that the EPC was
“genuinely concerned” about
the situation, and certainly

Skinner Speaks
Monday At Little

Dr. B. F. Skinner, the em-
inent psychologist of the be
havioristic school, will pre
sent a few of his projections
for the future in an address
Monday morning at Queens
College.

Skinner, the Harvard pra
fessor who gained © national
acelaim for his book ‘‘Wal-
den Two,’’ will take his topic
from the impact of the mes
sage on that book for the
future.

His talk, “Walden Two and
The Future,” will be
sented at 10 a. m. in

pre
the

Little Fine Arts Center at
Queens. It is open to the
public.

The book, and no doubt the
talk, deal with the visit by
two ex-GI's and their fiances
to a Utopian community run

* on the principles of Skinner's
behavioral engineering. All
things are owned in com
mon; everyone is always
happy.

The novel has provoked
mixed reactions from Skin-
ner’s academic contempor;
aries. It began some experi-
ments in communal _ living
along the lines described in
his book; on the opposite
side it provoked wide criti-

cism for its Utopian improba
bilities.

After his graduation from
Hamilton College in 1926, he
did fictional writing,
and along the way received

some

encouragement from: a num
ber of persons, including
Robert Frost.

He has said of this period,
“IT discovered the unhappy
fact that I had nothing to
say, and went on to graduate
school hoping to remedy this
shortcoming.

Today he is regarded high
ly for the vigor and freedom
from jargon of his technical
writing.

say that he thought most

Ostwalt urged — students,

wait until December and see
what is going to happen, em

was “expecting a reasonable
solution."” When asked how
