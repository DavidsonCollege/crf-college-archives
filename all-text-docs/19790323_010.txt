Colloquium examines sc

By MARGARET HUNTER

Features Graphics Editor

Have you ever been unable to
get out of a new kind of seat belt
and wondered if mankind really
controls the machines anymore?

Have you ever thought about

the fact that man’s new techno-
logical power is forcing him to
make decisions which he has
never had to deal with before...
and that the ethics which ghide
such decision-making are going
to have to be more sharply
scrutinized...?
_ The Spring Colloquium will
deal with such issues. This
series of lectures given by
Davidson professors and a
guest speaker will usually meet
at 4 pm Wednesday afternoons
in the 900 Room. A complete
schedule of the series appears.
on page 16.

Last week Professor of Philo-
sophy John Young opened the
first session, ‘Moral Dilemmas
in Science,”’ with the story of a
doctor examining a boy’s eyes.
The doctor held up his hand and
asked the boy how many fingers
were showing. “Four,” said the
boy. “How many?” asked the
doctor. ‘‘Four,’’ said the boy.

The doctor looked perturbed. ‘‘I
can’t count any higher,’ ex-
plained the boy. Young conclu-
ded that our knowledge of
ethics often limits our ability to
Rane eee.

Young created an ‘‘ethical
map” by distinguishing be-
tween three basic positions.

The first was epitomized by a
comment of Lewis Carroll’s bell
man in The Hunting of the
Snark. ‘‘Just the place for a
snark!’’ exclaimed the bell man
three times, as the hunters
began a search on a certain
island. ‘““What I tell you three
times is true!’’ the bell man
went on. Young described

_ ‘*snarkism'’ as the position
which says an action is ethical if
an individual, a group, or a
group says God says the action
is ethical. While snarkism deals
handsomely with individual
matters of taste, there is diffi-
culty welding the multitude of

caret —> ea nr

. snarkish values into a coherent

social policy.

Second there is utilitarian-
ism, which judges an action by
its consequences. While at-
tempting to be more objective
than snarkism, the utilitarians’
cost/benefit debates are limited
often by the uncertainty of risks
a certain action will entail (there
are many examples in medical
research), and the old question
of do-ends-really-justify-means.
Utilitarians also run into the
problem of whether it is fair
that those experimented upon
pay for the benefits received by
others.

Thirdly there are the intui-
tionists who claim that right-
ness is as self-evident to an
intelligent, informed, mature
individual as the statement tw>
plus two equalsfour. For ex-
ample, the value of human life
need not be questioned any
further than a mathematical
equation, not because both can
be proved true by similar me-
thods, but because both are un-
questionably true to the in-
formed individual. The problem
here is that the intuitionists
disagree about which values are
unquestionable, and which take
priority.

Young concluded that while
no stance is‘completely ade-
quate, each has its own
strengths and must be consi-
dered, for the alternative—no
stance—is untenable.

Yesterday’s lecture, given by
Professor of History David Shi
and entitled ‘‘Small is Beautiful
—and American,’’ dealt with
the contemporary trend of vol-
untary simplicity and its histo-

ience and values

ecciitece
rical roots. Evidence that this 18
a growing trend ranges from the
fact that articles on
simplicity are beginning to ap-
pear in corporate publications,
advertisers are beginning to sell
products using the ideas of qua-
lity and simplicity, and social
research centers are finding
shifts in values from material
security towards self-expression
and quality of life.

While the Stanford Research
Institute’s 1977 study of the
trend reveals that most volun-
tary-simplifiers today are
“young, white, well educated,
and from suburban or urban
areas,”’ giving the movement
something of a faddish appear-
ance, the trend is not without
historical precedence in Ameri-
can thought. Supporters among
the religious movements have
included the Pilgrims, Quakers,
Shakers, Amish, Mennonites
and others; among secular writ-
ers there have been Thomas
Jefferson, Ralph Waldo Emer-
son and, of course, Henry
David Thoreau.

Thoreau has been particularly
influential in the movement,
and continues to be popular
today. Though he didn’t main-
tain the radically simplified
life-style of Walden Pond for
much longer than two years, he
never gave up his belief that the
simpler life was better. His
continuing influence today is
shown by the fact that a
California company, which re-
cords books on casettes for
commuters with tape decks in
their cars, reports that the most
popular selection is none other
than Thoreau’s Walden. ~
