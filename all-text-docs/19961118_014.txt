Kruse’s Cubby
Just a game

By MICHAEL KRUSE

Politics is a crock.

Politicians tell the American
people that they want to do what’s
best for America. Who doesn’t? And
what the hell is best for America,
anyway?

Smile at the intellectually chal-
lenged horde below your podium.
Wave to all the walking, talking
votes. Pump your fist in their gen-
eral direction. Kiss a few babies.
Play alittle bridge with some human
dinosaurs at-an old folks’ home.
You’re golden.

Ifnothing else, our statespeople
know how to pick and choose their
words and actions very carefully.
Apparently though, San Francisco
Mayor Willie Brown never attended
Politics U. Or even Politics Com-
munity College, for that matter.

Brown went beyond foot-in-
the-mouth this week. He pretty much
shoved his whole damn leg in there
and bit it off. In a teleconference
with reporters, Mr. Mayor called
Elvis Grbac, the 49ers’ backup quar-
terback, “an embarrassment to hu-
mankind.”

Grbac, who was forced into the
Cowboys game last weekend when
starter Steve Young suffered a con-
cussion, had thrown a couple of key
interceptions and made some other
mental faux pas.

But Willie, ‘‘an embarassment
to humankind?” The man performed
less-than-admirably in a football
game. —

And what Brown didn’t know
was that Grbac’s nine-month-old son,
Jack, was born with spina bifida and
recently had surgery to alleviate pres-
sure on his spinal cord.

Grbac shuttled back and forth
between practice field and his son’s
hospital bed. When Brown was in-
formed of Grbac’s off-the-field situ-
ation, the mayor more or less re-
sponded with an “Oh, my bad.”

But little Jack Grbac shouldn’t
even be an issue here. Grbac’s life
could be as peachy dandy as peachy
dandy gets and his son could be the
picture of health. He still shouldn’t
be villified as a disgrace to his spe-
cies for mistakes he made on the
football field.

Yet another example of how, as
a society, we often place sports on
such a lofty pedestal as to forget
life’s simple priorities.

As Grbac told the media,
“There’s a lot of stuff going on in my
life right now and No. 1 is my fam-
ily. There’s other things more im-
portant than football at times.”

A soothing voice in a monu-
mentally bass ackwards culture. A
culture in which Michael Jordan is
making 30 million dollars this year.

Granted, MJ is without a doubt
the greatest basketball player in the
history of the universe. But does that
mean he should make roughtly a
third of a million everytime he steps
on the court, while our professors
here at Davidson - some of this
country’s finest - often don’t even
crack six figures? Does that mean he
should make tens of thousands of
dollars everytime he dunks or sinks
a free throw? Does that mean he
should be pocketing approximately
1200 Davidson tuitions?

' Hell no, hell no, and hell no.

Just an out. Just a shot. Just a
game.
Take note, Willie Brown.

Thursday night lights: Rugby finishes strong

By CLAYTON SCHLOSS AND

«

The rugby team concluded its
season with a convincing 27-5 vic-
tory over the UNC Charlotte 49ers

on Thursday night. Despite frigid

temperatures that dipped down into
the 30’s, the Wildcats were hot.
The 49ers got on the board
first, putting the Wildcats under
pressure with a huge kick. They
grabbed the ensuing Davidson

lineout deep in Wildcat territory,
and fell into the try zone.

But it was all Wildcats after
that.

Frank Killian evened the score
on a counter-attack down the left
flank. The Wildcats worked the
ball outside to Killian who split
two defenders, then overpowered
a would-be tackler for the try.

Thayer Long put Davidson
ahead for good a few minutes later.
He hustled into support and cre-
ated a two-on-one situation that

the Wildcats converted into a score.
The team held a 12-5 advantage at
the break.

Davidson put away all hopes
of a comeback early in the second
period.
Craig Murphy came in sup-
port of Michael Schenck’s eight-
man pick up. Schenck broke
through the 49er defense and
dropped a pass to Murphy who

finished off the run.

Moments later, Schenck fin-
ished another eight-man pick up

for a score.

Matt Burkhardt converted two
kicks after and also put a penalty .
kick through the uprights for the
other points.

“This was areally well played
game. After they scored first, we
just dominated,” said Long.

The win upped Davidson’s
record to 6-1, its only loss coming
on the road at the hands of rival
App. St. The squad will break for.
a few months, but looks to con-
tinue its success in early Spring.

BRIDGEWATER, Va. —
The postgame scene at Jopson
Field was like something out a
fairytale.

As. the Shenandoah Valley
sun slowly set, the Wildcats gath-
ered in the endzone and belted out
the fight song for the sixth and
final time this fall.

It was the most emotional
rendition, as the Wildcats’ sixth
win - a 27-24 hair-raiser over
Bridgewater in the season finale -
gave them only their sixth win-
ning season since 1959 and first
since 1993.

third straight, the 13 seniors be-
came the first class to post two
six-win campaigns since 1933.

“To finish up. with three
straight wins is really a storybook
ending,” said head coach Tim
Landis. “The future is real bright,
and these guys are going to have
to adjust to expectations being on
them now.”

“The sky’s the limit when
you look at all the freshmen and
sophomores starting or making
huge contributions,” added senior
cornerback Kevin Graham who
recovered two fumbles and made
a crucial tackle on a third-down
defensive stand late in the third
quarter.

Rookie fullback Eric
Ferguson, oné of the many
standout underclassmen, knotted
the game at 7-7 with 11:05 left in
the second quarter, shaking off
several would-be-tacklers on his
way to a 32-yard touchdown
rumble.

Ferguson totaled 101 yards
on the ground against the Eagles,
breaking the school rookie rush-

With the victory, Davidson’s

_ ing record (531) set last year by

current starting tailback Lorenzo
Moll,

The 5-11, 203-pounder also
added another touchdown, giving
him 10 for the year, also a new
first-year standard.

Veteran placekicker Dunn
Mileham chipped a 23-yard field
goal 1:08 before intermission, as
the Wildcats took a 10-7 advan-
tage into the lockerroom.

Bridgewater (5-5) claimed a
14-10 lead early in the third quar-
terona 28-yard TD toss from Chad
Rowland to Von Lewis.

But Davidson (6-4) countered
with a 9-yard Ferguson run with

6:47 left in the third and a 5-yard_

dash up the middle by Moll three
minutes later, grabbing a 24-14
lead.

Eagle kicker Michael Padgett
booted a 28-yard field goal with 34
seconds left in the third, cutting the
Wildcats’ lead to a touchdown
going into the fourth quarter.

Mileham split the uprights
with another 23-yarder with 7:26
to go and the Wildcat defense did
the rest, holding Bridgewater score-
less throughout the final frame until
Rowland found Lewis again for a
30-yard scoring strike with 45 ticks
remaining.

Senior Pete Perri scooped up
Bridgewater’s ensuing onside kick,
securing the Wildcat win.

Davidson’s offense registered
its second-highest point output of
the year against a touted Eagle
defensive corps that entered the
game atop the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference in both scoring
(13.9) and yards (231.2).

Signal-caller Tommy Dugan
paced the potent attack, throwing
for 188 yards on 15-for-24 effi-
ciency and amassing 71 yards rush-
ing in leading the Wildcats to 376

yards of total offense, including
232 on the ground.

“The seniors were really key
in our six wins this year. We’re
going to miss them,” said sopho-
more wide receiver Mike
Harrington, who made a 28-yard
reception on an important third-

down effort during Davidson’s ©

second touchdown drive.

“But the majority of the team
is sophomores and juniors and
freshmen. So hopefully, the next
few years we can build up and be
10-0.”

“T can’t emphasize enough
that the 13 seniors, we couldn’t

have done what we did this year + ~

without them,” said Landis. “And
that’s a tribute to them. I’m just
real proud of them that they could
leave like this. They’re a special
group. I asked them in the begin-
ning of the year what their legacy
was going to be, and they left a
pretty good legacy.”

“It’s a great improvement
from last year (when the Wildcats
were 1-8-1),” said senior tackle
and co-captain John Cowan, who
started all 40 possible games in
his Davidson career.

“This team’s only going to
get better. There’s nothing stop-
ping them.”

Male harriers rebound, run to solid finish

By Aaron DuNHAM
Staff Writer

_ The Davidson men’s cross
country team completed one of its
most successful seasons on Satur-
day with a solid showing in the
NCAA Region III Championships

at Furman University.

The Wildcats placed 36th, a
very impressive showing fora non-
scholarship téam. Davidson also
finished ahead of three Southern
Conference foes (Georgia South-
ern, Furman and The Citadel) who

finished ahead of the Wildcats at

the Southern Conference Champi-
onships two weeks ago.

The meet was dominated by
ACC teams who took six of the top
ten positions. N.C. State won the
meet and Wake Forest finished a
close second.

The Davidson harriers will

look to be equally competitive next
season. Junior Josh Cookson, un-
doubtedly the top individual onthe
team, returns as does a pack of top
freshmen, including William
Isenhour. The only key loss is the
departure to graduation of captain
Dave Foss.
