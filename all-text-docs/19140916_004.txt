FROM ABROAD.

(Concluded from page 1)

While in Paris the party visited the
Louvre and had the pleasure of looking
upon the original Mona Lisa, about
which so much has been written recently.
Beside the beautiful paintings here are
world famous pieces of sculpture, such
as the unsurpassed statue of Venue.

One of the most interesting things
noted in Paris, especially at this time,
was the great Military Review, the
troops passing in review before the booth
of President Poincare. A happy spirit
of pride and confidence was evident
which reached a climax when fourteen

‘military acroplanes soared above the
field.

France has a right to be proud of her
splendid fighting machine, for almost
miraculous strides forward have been
taken since her misfortune of 1870,
when Germany captured Paris. France
has never forgiven Germany for those
dark days and as a perpetual reminder
the French have erected a tomb-like
monument in Paris, kept veiled in
mourning showing the national grief
over the loss. of the French provinces,
Alsace and Lorraine. As soon as war
was declared against Germany, a how!l-
ing, patriotic mob snatched the mourn-
ing, dress from the monument and deck-
ed it in the tricolor of France.

Another reminiscence of the war of
1870 is that Germany took the huge in-
demnity paid by France, and deposited it
in great treasuries on the. German
border. ‘Vhis money has never been put
into circulation, but has been kept there
to use in the next war, Germany will
have to dig to the bottom of the pile of
gold, from the appearance of things at
present,

From Paris the party cycled in’ a
southeaserly direction, traveling at the
rate of about forty miles per day over the
beautiful macadam reads of — France.
Among the places visited were Avignon,
celebrated in history as “the place of the
Babylonigsh captivity of the Popes,” the
Popes dwelling here instead of Rome.
At Nimes was seen the famous old Ro-
man amphitheater, where were held the
great vladiatorial combats, and where
Christian martyrs were often fed to the
lions. Modern improvements have pene-
trated even to the interior of this old!
amphitheater, for now electric — lights
have been installed and modern niovies
are shown daily on the interior of this
historic old pile.

While coasting down mountain grades
two of the cyclists met with mishaps.
Charlie Fleming, while: making a sharp
turn, had the misfortune of coming into
sharp contact with Mother Earth. “Phis
necessitated a delay for him, and Mal-
cohn Shirley assisted him to the town of
St. Flour, where they were treated with
great kindness by the courteous French.
Shirley gives glowing accounts of a
beautiful French girl at St. Flour. He
blushingly declares she was an angel.

The party united once more journey-
ed on to Nice, on the shores of the Med-
iterranean. Here the most exciting time
of the trip ocurred. Before reaching
Nice, war was declared and time after
time the party was halted and examined,
so great was the fear of spies among the
French, Mobilization was taking place
with great swiftness and soon every
bridge and culvert) was manned — by
French soldiery. ,

After many delays the party reached
Nice, and engaged board at a German
hotel, only to be told in a few hours
that they must go elsewhere, as the
French government had ordered all Ger-
mans and Austrians to leave France.
For a long time it looked as though no
passage for hime could be obtained, so
great was the demoralization brought on
bv the war. The party spent the time in
Nice, swimming in the Mediterannean,
riding about the country, and watching
the troops leaving on every train, bound
for the front. Great cheerfulness and
confidence was shown by the French as
they left their homes and all that was
dear to them, many leaving for the -last
time.

After weeks of anxiety, the “David-
sonians Abroad” managed to obtain pas-

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN. September 16, 1914

Spain.

‘The men reached Davidson a little
late, but were received with open arms
by the student body. ‘They have many
interesting yarns to unwind about their
trip, and especially about the war. Con-
gratulations are in order that our David |
sonians are back among the fold, safe
and sound, not having been riddled by
German and French bullets.

Dr. Lingle talks interestingly about
the war, predicting that it will last only
six months. He says that Germany’
first successes were like a boy starting at
full speed to run a ten mile race. Like
the runner, Germany must soon be ex-
hausted because of her preliminary burst
of speed. ‘Then, says Dr. Lingle, the
Allies will dictate the terms of peace to
poor Germany.

M. C. A. MEMBERSHIP
RALLY WELL ATTENDED.

y.

In response to the call for a member-
ship rally a large number of old and new
students attended the first meeting of
the Young Men's Christian Association
held in Shearer Hall on last Thursday
evening. A special program of talks and
music had been arranged, and miuch in-
terest was manifested.

A large sreproduction of the emblem
of the Association, with its equalateral |
triangle of Spirit, Mind and Bodv, hung
on the wall at the back of the platform.
This formed the subject of the talks
which were made by Coach Fetzer and
Dr. Arbuckle and Dr. Martin.

Coach Fetzer, in his quite, forcefuil
manner, spoke of the necessity for a
well trained body. He pointed out that
it was a part of the Christian’s duty to
keep himself in the best condition pos-
sible; and that in this way only could
he accomplish the most good.

The next speaker was Dr. Arbuckle.
whose subject was the spiritual aspect of
the Association’s work. With an earn:
estness which evidenced his.deep interes
in the subject he showed the fundamen
tal necessity. of spirituality in the de-
velopment of the all-round man... ‘This
he said. is primary and should be found
closely associated with both the other
branches of the work.

The final subject of the mitid and. its
part in the work of the Y. MLC. A.
was handled by Dr. Martin. Ele showed’
«the relation which a sound body. a right
spirit, and strong mind should bear to

jone another, saving that each was. de
‘pendent upon the others,

and urging
ithat everyone give serious consideration
to the development ot these three essen
tials to a strong and useful lite.

A male quarter composed of Afessrs.
Fowle, Ansley, Johnston, and AlcGea-
chy, then sang “Immortal Love.” which
in its melodic harmonies and beautifil!
sentiment was very impressive.

Following this. membership — cards
were passed through the audience and!
about fifty new men. signified their in-
tention of joining the Association. Thes:
men together, with about forty who have
joined since, and any others who mav
wish to join at this time will be: regu-
larly installed as members next Thurs-
dav nieht. Dr. Weatherford. the Gen-
eral Student Secretary for the South
is expected to be present and have charge
of the meeting.

ately:
