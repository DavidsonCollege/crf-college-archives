raised them permissively, and
who have the affluence to ignore
conventional worries about jobs
and status, according to a re-

In a study of “the roots of
student protest,” Richard
Flacks. assistant professor of
sociology, writes, “It seems
plausible that this is the first
generation in which a substan.
tial number of youth nave both
the impulse to free themselves
from conventional status con-
cerns and can afford to do so.”

PROTEST REASONS

Flaecks proposed as an hypoth-
esis that students today ate ac-
tive in protest because:

They find student life highly
“ratjonalized,”’ which is related
to impersonality and competi-
tiveness.

They have been reared in per-
missive, democratic families,
which place high values on

standards other than high status
and achievement:

These values make it more
difficult for students to submit
to adult authority, respect status
distinctions, and accept the pre-
vailing rationalized, competitive

non-commitment to concern with

Finally, the formerly disorgan-

East Cites New War Tactics
For Curbing Red Aggression

ment is trying to win in Viet

Congress from the North Caro-

day.

East, a political science pro

and a graduate of Earlham Col-

vote since Reconstruction in his
district.

sad East. “I commend it: I

However, he noted. “military
experts have proposed a num-
ber of recommendations to bring
the war to a close, and I see no
reason why we cannot win a
limited war."

In order to end the war. East
suggested that the government
take four actions.

First, the port of Haiphong
should be closed, he said. This
is conventional military strat-
egy, and similar actions were
taken during the Korean War,
he cont:nued.

The port could be blocked by

study of the family backgrounds,
political beliefs and values of
students active in such move-
ments.

In one part of his research, he
sent a crew of interviewers to
talk with parents of students who
live in the Chicago area who
were listed as participating in
national protest groups, such as
the Students for a Democratic
Society, Studert Non-violent Co-
ordinating Committtee, or peace
groups. The students attended
26 different colleges around the
country.

Parents were asked about their
own political attitudes, what
kinds of values they held most
strongly and how they had rais-
ed their children. The students
themselves were also asked for
their views on their parents.

A group of “non-activists”
similar in such factors as eco-
nomic status to the activists was
also interviewed as a control.

RESEARCH REPEATED

For a second study, Flacks
seized the opportunity offered by
the spring sit-in at University of
Chicago’s administration build-

|'3 Deferment Tests
|| Slated For Spring

The draft deferment qualifi-

cation examinations will be giv-

en three times next spring ac-
cording to. an announcement
from Seleetive Service head-

quarters:

“IT have not been formally no-
tified as to whether the tests
will be given at Davidson.” Dr.
W. B. Hight. director of stu-
dent counseling. said this week.

‘““T'm going to do my best to

have them given here.’ Hight
continued.

The tests, prepared by the
Educational Testing Service of
Princeton, N. J., will be given
March 11 and 31 and again on
April 8. Applications will be
available from local draft
boards after Jan. 20, and must
be mailed by Feb. 10.

More than 110,000 men took a
similar examination last month.
The results of those examina-
tions will be reported to the lo-
cal boards by Dec. 19. Only
men who have not taken the test
previously are eligible to take
tt in the spring.

of destroyers, by mining or by
sabotage. |

Next, East stated that the U.
S. should “‘destroy through dai-
ly saturated pinpoint bombing
of everything made of concrete,
steel, brick or mortar that is
used in the war in the south.”

Clarifying nis statement, he
sa'd that bombing should not
include the civilian population.
Suggesting the bombing of irri-
gation dikes to cut off food
grown for the south, he asked,
“Would you rather destroy con-
crete dikes or throw away a
thousand of your own country-
men each week?"

Third, East asked for bomb-
ing of the supply trails in Laos
and Cambodia. This has been
done, but only spasmodically.

“Finally.” he said, “if Amer-
ica is to be involved in a land
war in Asia, then it must call
on Asia’s greatest resource, peo-
ple.

*‘We cannot win under these
rules,” East continued. Amer.
ica’s strength lies in firepower,
not manpower. ‘‘We cannot wear
out Chinese machine guns with
American boys,” he said. The
United States must get larger

Student activists differ in
terms of values and attitudes
from non-activists to a high de-
gree.

He attributes the uniformity
among activists to the effects of
a subculture reflecting their
shared p®rspectives, not simply
to ‘‘common personality traits
or social origins.”

Parents of. activists also ‘‘de-
viate from ‘conventional middle.
class’ values and attitudes,” to
a marked degree.

The difference of values be
tween students can be directly
traced to different values of
their parents, Flacks believes.
He contradicts ‘‘a frequently ex-
pressed stereotype of ,activists
students as ‘rebels’ against pa-
rental authority.”

Activists are not idealogues.
While they are ‘militant, com-
mitted, and ‘radical’ with re-
spect to particular issues, they
are not committed to overarch-
ing ideological positions.”

This point is reflected ‘‘most
dramatically in their unwilling-
ness to describe themselves as
‘socialist’ or to endorse explic-
itly socialist policies."’ Flack
reports.

FEW SOCIALISTS

In demographic terms, Flacks
found that activists are likely
to- be from high-income, well-
educated, professional families
from urban areas. Activists are
also disproportionately Jewish,
and tend to come from recen!
immigrant stock, his study
found.

Only about one-third of the ac-
tivists in the large sample of
Chicago area students, however,
said their political position was
*socialist,"" while more than
half said they were “highly lib-
eral.”

Those in the ‘‘non-activist'’
control group were predominate-
ly in the ‘‘moderately liberal”
class (43 per cent), with almost
three out of 10 in the: “‘moder-
ately conservative’’ group and
two-tenths calling themselves
“highly liberal.”

While all students reported
opinions more liberal than those
of their parents, there was a
significant gap between the pa-
rents of activists and those of
non-activists.

Clearly, student activists are
likely to come from liberal, po-
litically active families.

foreign troop commitments.

Communist China can do lit-
tle, according to East. Para-
lyzed by internal conflict, they
are not capable of war. Nor will
the North Viet Namese permit
Chinese troops on Viet Namese
soil, for, like the Russians, the
Chinese have a tendency to stay
where they are invited.

He said that Communist ag-
gression must be halted before
a social or economic revolution
could take place. He also noted
the presence of 30,000 U. S.
troops in Thailand, and said that
if the U. S. fails in Viet Nam,
it will soon find the same sit-
uation in Thailand.

*TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY

I know how busy you are—studying, going to class, help-
ing old grads find their dentures after Homecoming—but,
hark, the Yuletide is almost upon us and it’s time we
turned our thoughts to Christmas shopping.

We'll start with the hardest gift problem of all: what to
give the man who has everything. Well sir, here are some
things I’ll bet he doesn’t have: 1).A dentist’s chair, 2) A
Mach number. 3) A street map of Perth, Australia. 4)
Fifty pounds of chicken fat. 5) A pack of Personna Suver
Stainless Steel Blades.

“What?” you exclaim, your eyebrows leaping in wild
incredulity. “The man who has everything doesn’t have
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades ? What arrant non-
sense!” you scoff, making a coarse gesture.

But I insist. The man who has everything doesn’t have
Personna because everyone in the dorm is always borrow-
ing them. And small wonder! Wouldn’t you be there with
an empty razor and a supplicating sidle if you heard some-
body had super-blades that were super-sharp and super-
durable; that scrape not, neither do they nick; that shave
you easily and breezily, qui and slickly, scratchlessly
and matchlessly ; that come both in Double-Edge style and
Injector style? Of course you would!

So here is our first gift suggestion. If you know a man
who shaves with Personna, give him a safe.

Next let us take up the thorny problem of buying gifts
when you have no money, Well sir, there are many won-
derful gifts which cost hardly anything. A bottle of good
clear water, for example, is always welcome. A nice smooth
rock makes a charming paperweight. In fact, one Christ-
mas back in my own college days, these are exactly the
gifts I gave a beauteous coed named Norma Glebe. I took
a rock, a bottle of water, a bit of ribbon, and attached a
-ard with this tender sentiment:

Here’s some water

And here’s a rock,

l love you, daughter,

Around the clock.

Norma was so moved, she seized the rock, smashed the

pottle, and plunged the jagged edge into my sternum.

Here now is a lovely gift for an American History major
—a bronze statuette of Millard Fillmore with a clock in
the stomach. (Mr. Fillmore, incidentally, was the only
American president with a clock in his stomach. James K.
Polk had a stem-winder in his head and William Henry
Harrison chimed the quarter-hour, but only Mr. Fillmore
of all our chief executives had a clock in his stomach.
Franklin Pierce had a sweep second hand and Zachary
Taylor had 17 jewels and Martin Van Buren ticked but, I
repeat, Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Fillmore alone had a clock
in his stomath. Moreover, Mr. Fillmore was the first presi-
dent with power steering. No wonder they called him
“Old Hickory !")

But I digress. Returning to Christmas gifts, here's one
that's sure to please—a gift certificate from the American
Society of Chiropractors. Accompanying cach certificate
is this fetching little poem:

Merry Christmas, Happy New Year,

Joyous sacro-iliac!

May your spine forever shine,

Blessings on your aching back!

May your lumbar ne'er grow number,

May your backbone ne'er dislodge,

May your caudal never dawdle,

Joyeux Noel! Heureux massage!
