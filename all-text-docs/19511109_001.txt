Laundry Rovenges
Self By Lousing
Satirist’ Duds

When Don Mahy, cyrtoonist for
the laundry-slamming Scripts 'N’
Pranks opened his laundry pack-
age early this week, a sight worse
than usual greeted his eyes.

Two white dress shirts were now
a splotchy bluc, unpressed, and
completely bereft of every button.
As a final insult, X877 was writ-
ten in pencil all over the shirts.

Two sheets, a pillowcase, socks,
towels, T-shirts and underwear
were equally maltreated—dyed a
nauseous baby blue and inscribed
everywhere with X-877,

Muttered Mahy mournfully:
“The dyeing vat is mightier
than the pen. My wardrobe can-.
not withstand continyed - yar:
fare with the laundry. | sur:
render,’ ”

Asriving at the laundry, Mahy
was greeted with a howl of derisive
laughter, The entire staff had
joined in the desecration of his
clothing and awaited his baffled
protest,

At length a peace was ar-
ranged—the laundry will re-
place buttons, wash out blue
dye and respect future laun-
dry.

Still wearing baby blue T-shirts
and underwear, Mahy cheerfully
admits the laundry has a powerful
and imaginative sense. of humor.

Minor Roles (By “Y’ Directors

Are Revealed

By NAT DANIEL

In the Red and Black Masquers
presentation of “Ten Little In-
dians,”” as in every production, there
are those who carry the brunt of
the plot along—the leading char-
acters, There are also the support-
ing roles, which though perhaps
not as significant to the plot as are
the lead, are still indispensable in
the ‘structure of a play.

The supporting cast of “Ten Lig-
tle Indians” consists of Tad Currle,
Ethel Beach, Vance Mizelle, How-
ard Proctor, Alden Williams, Mac
Williams and Bill Phifer.

Currie Again

Familiar to us all as an actor is
Tad Currie, who plays the part of
Dr, Armstrong, a nerve specialist
who has accidentally le: a patient
die and as 9 result ‘has become
a neurotic himself,

Tad’s name has apparead in
the program of every play gine
he came, ¢o Davidson—in
“John Loves Mary.” as props
erty man for “The Man Who
Came to Dinner,” as director
of “Command Decision,” and
as Mark Anthony in “Julius
Caesar,”

Miss Beach, who is Dr, Cunning-
‘ham's secretary, plays the pact of
Mrs, Roberts, the butler’s wife,
who is mysteriously poisoned ane
night on Indian Island.

Vance Mizelle, who has ap-
peared in “The Man Whp Came ta
Dinner.” and "Jyliys Caesar,” por:
trays Philip Marston, » playhey
with a sports car and speed mania
who has accidentally killed twa
children. :

Proctor, Ex-Gon

Howard Proctor, who played a
leading svpparting role in “The
Man Who Came to Dinner,” is cast
as William Blone, a cockney ex-
convict whose recard is far from
lily-white.

T. Alden Witlilams, in his gecqnd
appearance on the Davidson stage,
plays a retired army general who
supposedly murdered his wife, and
who has gone completely off his
rocker,

Alden was cast in the role: of
General Hanes in “Command De-
cisign.”

Negligent Butler

Mack Williamson, 2 freshman,
plays the part of Roberts, the but-
ler, who with his wife, acciflentally

his series of talks on the theme
“to choose a vocation for which
you are best-equipped.”

At Vespers he stressed the need | b

Dr, Neleon brought out that
most average Americans are
bored with their jobs and do
not feel that they are suitably
placed. This is against the will
of God because there is a di-
vine intention for every life,
and every layman is called by
God to do the job he is best
suited for in the eyes of society.

He pointed out that 2 call is
“seeing a need and fealizing” bat
