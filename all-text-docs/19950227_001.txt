Physical Plant lays off employees

Due to financial insecurities, Bob Collins revamps operation

By JAy JENNINGS
Staff writer

The Physical Plant laid off
workers two Fridays ago, sparking
controversy about the operations
of the department. Bob Collins,
Director of the Physical Plant, made
the changes in an effortto make the
Physical Plant a more efficient
operation.

A Physical-Plant worker who
was not laid off and would speak
only under the condition of ano-
nymity interprets the “reasoning
behind [the theory of] layoffs to
increase fear to increase output.”
The worker also suggested that
“mismanagement” led to the people
being laid off.

Collins disputes the charge of
mismanagement and believes it is

Last year several students at-
tempted to begin a movement for
a co-ed eating house. The idea
hardly even got off the ground,
and students rejected a co-ed al-
ternative forthe familiarity of their
individual houses. This year
change was rejected again when a
group visited campus to inform
female students about the possi-
bility of forming sororities.

Why is this? The character of

Music Department Chair William
Lawing was a student. In the last
20 years, Patterson Court has seen
constant change that can been at-
tributed to more than just the in-
troduction of women into the
Davidson social scene.

Lawing feels that students to-
day tend to be more satisfied with
the status quo. In addition to this
conservative nature, he also sees
an equilibrium between the men’s
and women’s houses that seems
to benefit most everyone.

He says, “That pendulum that
I have seen swing back and forth
seems to be settling, and I think
that’s healthy. I was [a student at
Davidson] in a very liberal time.”

When Lawing was a fresh-
man, the Court had twelve frater-
nities, and over 90% of men

an example of “better management
and better use of tuition because of
the increased efficiency.” The fac-
tors considered for retention were
skills, seniority, dependability, and
potential to meet changes. Collins
says that most of the people who
lost their jobs had been hired re-
cently and thus did not have se-
niority with the college.

The Physical Plant had ap-

proximately 80 people before the
cuts and changes were made. Ac-
cording to
Collins, six

pledged. Lawing says, “Fraterni-
ties were a necessity. If you were
independent, then you were really
alone. In a sense there was really
no question if I would pledge.”
The college went to a self-
selection policy in 1970, when a
group of independents made a
strong pitch not to pledge.
Throughout the 70’s, with women

suddenly on the scene, the Court
went from all-male houses to pre-
dominantly co-ed houses. Twelve
fraternities (our current seven in
addition to Sigma Chi, Beta Theta
Pi, Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma Nu, and
Alpha Tau Omega) became three,
and seven new houses were formed.

ATO and PiKA became co-
ed, FIJI and Sig Ep moved off-

to tend toward si

campus, and Kappa Sig dropped
their charter. KA, SAE, and Phi
Delt remained strong fraternities
oncampus. Additional co-ed eat-
ing houses were Fannie and Mabel
(named after the cooks), Random
House, PAX (for “give peace a
chance”), and Emanon (“no
name” spelled backwards).

Rusk, the first women’s eat-
ing house, was formed in 1977.

cided they wanted a new option
on the Court.

In 1992, Connor was formed
after Spencer closed. Since then,
little has happened to fundamen-
tally change the Court. “When
we are in more conservative peri-
ods fraternities seem to be more
embraced,” says Lawing, “In
some periods of time [the “selec-
tivity”] is more condoned. The
system has evolved at different
periods of time and has found a
different way to work with each
class.”

So what does this mean for
1995? Will our children see the
same Patterson Court that we do?

Experiential Programs to move

By Russ TARVER
Associate Editor

In an effort to enhance career
services at Davidson, Experiential
Progams will move from the base-

ment of the Union to the current -

Career Services office on Main
Street. An individual will be hired
to replace current director of Ex-
periential Programs Ken Wood,
who will retire in May.

Why the change?

Director of Career Services
Carol Jordan explains the move:
“Several years ago Dean Will Terry
decided, at Ken Wood’s request,
to split internships and summer
jobs into one entity and then have
career placement and planning in
another entity. We shifted students
back and forth. When Ken de-
cided he would retire, the college
looked to see what to do with the

two entities. If you look at other
schools, all of the services are to-
gether.”

However, some worry that

‘under this new arrangement, non-

career oriented Experiential Pro-
grams could be neglected.

Could experiential
learning be neglected?
Jordan says she will divide

hercurrentresponsibilities plus the
handling of Experiential Programs

with Wood’s replacement. “The
job will be filled by a person with
a master’s degree and over five
years of experience and who has
had direct experience in a liberal
arts setting, some very strong
knowledge of experiential pro-
grams and placement, and the po-
sition will be a colleague for me. It

Dean of
Faculty
warns of
budget
cuts

By Mattuew Eiricu

Assistant News Editor
_ On January 31, Dean of Fac-
ey sible« ar-—

eas for the next year. The memo
cited “insufficient funds” as the
cause for the possible cuts.

No final decisions have been
made about which cuts will be
made, but Williams described the
proposed cuts to be as “minimal.”
Such cuts may include reductions
in faculty travel budgets and the
elimination of departmental travel
and lecture budgets.

- By comparison, other institu-
tions similar to Davidson have had
to make cuts described by Will-
iams in the memo as “Draconian.”
These severe cuts include salary
freezes or reductions and the elimi-
nation of teaching positions or de-
partments.

Williams says the school has
“no intention of eliminating any
department ... Other academic in-
stitutions have actually had to de-
crease salaries and close depart-
ments and positions. We don’t
have to do that.”

Williams says that the
faculty’s common budget crunch
is caused by an imbalance in the
distribution of the college’s oper-
ating expenses. Williams stresses
that “Davidson is in good’ shape
financially” but its allocation of
funds to various areas of the col-
lege needs to be reconsidered, For
instance, while the faculty’s salary
