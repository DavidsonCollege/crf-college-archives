The Davidson ian

By GEORGE STROBEL

Davidson's football team,
having crushed Guilford 31-0
last week, is gearing them-
selves for a tough game ag-
ainst Hampden-Sydney this
Saturday.

This was the second consec-

utive victory for the Cats.
However, the competition
toughens considerably for the
remaining four games.
Hampden-Sydney, this Sat-
urday's opponents, are ranked
nationally in NCAA division
III. But the Wildcats have
been working hard from the
start of the season and think
that they will win Saturday.
In the last two weeks the
Wildcat defense has given up
only seven points. The defense
this year has been anchored by
a young and aggressive defen-
sive line.
The coaching staff has been
pleased by the improvement

Pinckney paces Cat runners

Led by senior Coty Pinck-
ney's near record setting pace,
the Davidson cross-country
team ran away from Hamp-
den-Sydney and host Lynch-
burg College on Saturday,
October 1c,

In the three-way meet, Dav-
idson took seven of the top ten
places and bolstered its record
to 3-1.

Pinckney’s time of 26:50 on
Lynchburg’s arduous .five-mile
course missed breaking the old
record by a scant 4/5 of a
second. His performance be-
comes even more remarkable
when one considers the extra.
ordinary navigational difficul-
ties encountered on a course
which features a wide variety

shown by the defensive secon-

dary in the last two weeks. If
Davidson is to fare well in the

last four games of the season
the secondary must play well.

The key to the offense this
year has been the steady

blocking of a veteran offensive

line, making the job a lot

, easier for the nimble running

of Pete Legler and Page
Walley.

The most improved part of

the Wildcat game over last
year is the kicking game.
Davidson had a 63-yard punt
last week from Sophomore
Steve Risley. Risley attribu-
ted his punting success to the
coaching he's received from
his hallmates-this year.

The rest of Davidson's sche-
dule includes VMI and Lehigh
away and Delaware at home in
two weeks.

With a win, this week,

Saturday is 1:30 pm.

of roots and rocks, several
steep hills; numerous sharp
turns, and a treacherously
narrow nature trail.

Coach Norm Koller was
additionally encouraged by
the sixth place performance of
Junior Captain Doug Horn,

“who is undergoing a painful
bout with interdigital neuroma
in his right foot.

Also scoring for the Wild-
cats were John Davis, second,
George Strobel, fourth, Bart
Landess, seventh, Jeff Mor-
row, eighth, and Tom Scott,
tenth.

The harriers traveled to
Charleston, South Carolina,
the following week, but did
not fare so well.

Southern Conference foes
Furman, Appalachian State,
and The Citadel defeated Dav-
idson, whose sole victory was

over UT-Chattanooga, a new-
comer to the conference.

Pinckney had another sup-
erb day and finished sixth. His
time of 25:21 on the swift
Citadel course is a new school
record for five miles.

Sophomore Jeff Morrow
was another bright spot. A
strong final two miles enabled
him to finish 24th with a
personal best time of 27:02.

The rest of the team lent
little support to the effort,
however, as many of the
younger runners had mediocre
races.

John Davis was 22nd, Bart
Landess 33rd, George Strobel
36th, Tom Scott 39th, and
Vasili Carperos-4 1st.

The Wildcats’ next race will
be the North Carolina State
Championship meet on Octo-
ber 22, at Raleigh.

SCAMPERING FOR a long gainer, sophomore halfback Craig Pyles gets a few more of his
yards. Pyles also scored a touchdown in his best game to date.
