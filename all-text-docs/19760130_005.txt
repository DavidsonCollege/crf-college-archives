.. Tenure proceeds from e valuat tion

[Continued from page 4]

up, carrying out his routine lectures
but unwilling to push either himself or
his students towards excellence.
Through mutual concern and sharing
experiences, colleagues can help one
another to overcome these and other
problems.

Faculty evaluation should proceed
routinely and regularly for all profes-
sors and should not be only a test for
those under consideration for tenure.
Perhaps every five years on a
staggered basis the work of each
professor should be reviewed by an
elected committee of his peers who
examine his teaching, scholarship,
service to his college or university and
service beyond the academic
community.

When confronted with this issue,
many faculty argue that such an
evaluation cannot be made since one
cannot specify in precise detail the
criteria for evaluation. But if an
evaluation is conducted with good
will, common sense, and attention to
many simple empirical facts, much
can be accomplished.

Does the faculty member attend
professional meetings? Does he
systematically work to improve the
library holdings? Does he read current
journals in his field? Is he readily
available to students? Do his syllabi
change from year to year? Has he
published recently in his field? Is the
peofessor demanding in his courses?
Does he hand back papers in a
reasonable time with enough
comments to help students to
improve their writing? These are just

a few of the questions that can be
asked in such an examination, and, of
course, no one would expect every
professor to do all of them well.
Outisde examiners can also be
employed to good effect. We should
view then not as threats to us but
rather as consultants who can help us
in our performance. We can learna
great deal from colleagues at other
institutions, how they organize their
curricula, how they teach. They can
observe our situation with an objec-
tivity impossible for us to hold, and
they can describe what they see in our
situation without self-interest.
Consultants who understand our

mission as a liberal arts college should

be chosen since it would be futile to
employ someone who faulted us for
not being a graduate school or
research institute when we had no
intention of becoming one.

To be effective, faculty evaluation
must be linked strongly to the
institution’s system of rewards and
promotions. Good teaching, good
scholarship, and good service ought
to be rewarded by above-average
salary increases and promotions. An
institution which fails to distinguish
between excellence and mediocrity
often kills the incentive of tenured
faculty members.

Knowing whether or not you
publish, devote yourself to good
teaching and close relationships with
students, or contribute to the institu-
tion through extensive committee
service, not only makes little or no
difference in compensation but also
convinces many faculty that their
college or university really does not

care. Then when the same institution
_accuses the faculty o} of hiding behind |
‘tenure, the administrators can blame:
only themselves for refusing to
reinforce excellence in performance.

A committee of four, composed of
the dean of faculty and faculty
representatives from the humanities,
sciences, and social sciences, could
perform the task of this evaluation.
Elected by the faculty for fixed terms,
professors serving on the committee
could also be given a reduction in
course load or additional compensa-
tion to perform this time consuming
task.

Such a committee would have the
responsibilities of reviewing and
recommending professors for tenure,
promotions and salary increases. To
perform their function, all professors,
including the tenured, would come
under periodic review and be
evaluated according to standard
criteria.

Important to this process would be
the opinion of students. Information
from student evaluation forms cowd

be amassed, classes of professors:

visited, and opinions invited from

students wishing to give them. Under °

such a system, departaent. chairmen
would still initiate méndations
for advancement, but attempting to
achieve fairness and equity among all
faculty, this committee would review
such suggestions.

Faculty under evaluation would
meet with the committee to receive
their suggestions and discuss ways of
improving. No ‘‘perfect teachers”’
exist, and to think that we cannot
improve either accepts the myth that

we are the impeccable purveyors of
truth or cynically admits failure in our
teaching. Every dedicated teacher
wants to become a more effective,.
teacher, and he gladly accepts
constructive criticism. _

If successful, what would sucha
committee achieve? One could
reasonably expect at least some
improvement in the quality of
teaching and research at an institu-
tion. By engaging in such evaluation
procedures, the faculty would also
accept its responsibility to prevent
incompetence and laziness (the chief
criticism of tenure) among its tenured
members. Tenure could thereby be
viewed not as job security but more
properly as a device to ‘protect
academic freedom.

What do we say to those, however,
who believe that evaluation can best
be left in the hands of administrators?
Certainly a faculty committee can be
just as fallible as any individual, but
by electing a rotating committee the
faculty will be affirming its corporate
responsibility of maintaining
competence.among its own members.
Because the committee will only be as
strong as its members, the faculty
will have to choose wisely.

One last caveat: knowing the
genuine dislike that many of my
colleagues have for the innumerable
committees that often draw us away
from teaching, conversations with
students, and research, I could only
urge the adoption of evalua-
tion committee if simultaneously six
to ten other committees. were

abolished.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Spencer logic and ‘freshman-itis’

To The Editor:

After having experiented the first
sixteen games of the Wildcat
basketball season, heard the talk
around campus about our team’s lack
of success, and thrown up several
times listening to the radio and
hearing the unbelievable ‘‘goings on”’
at an away game, I feel I must speak
out on what is an outrage.

Coach Bo Brickels has done what
I didn’t think possible. He has,
succeededin bungling what could
have been a decent season through a
stomach-turning lack of coaching
savvy during games and a confusing
philosophy of individuals’ roles. I
wish to call this by the general term
“‘freshman-itis,”’ something I hope he
rids himself of quickly.

By his extended use of the
freshmen and extensive awarding of
bench time to the vets, the Davidson
team, our Davidson team, has
evolved into a mangled group of
players without a leader, or better

yet, leaders. The freshmen have so
much pressure on them by such an
unbalance of playing time on the
court that there is no way for the
upperclass players to show leadership

_and share the burden.

He has idolized the freshmen so
much he doesn’t realize (or so it
appears by his substitution practice)
what a mess it is on the court. The
multitude of mistakes has succeeded
in getting our team blown out several
times, unnecessarily, and in losing at
least four,games that should have
been ours.

Onstead of playing the experienced
vets, he continues to substitute
madly and actually winds up with
combinations that aren’t even tried in
practice.

The vets could settle down the
game, but for some reason he delights
in seeing a three ring circus of
turnover after turnover, missed
assignment upon missed assignment.
freshmen play a little less and give
about twenty-five minutes a game to
the three upperclassmen who deserve
a chance to play? I live with two of
those three, and I get sick and tired of
having at least five people per day ask
me. what: my roommates think about
the whole thing.

For a. school with a sincere
commitment to major college.
basketball, 4-12 is not very major,
and it’s an insult to the intelligence of
everyone here to think that with the

personnel on our team- all the

personnel--we are that bad.

Last year we had a freshman that
saw plenty of action, with the
explanation that it would be beneficial

this year, but he’s catching splinters —

in the rear from a hard bench. This
year’s freshmen are getting the same
treatment, but what will happen to
them next year with the new
freshmen?

Hopefully Coach Bo Brickels. will
get himself together by the time the
Southern Conference tournament
comes around- right now that looks
like our only hope of redemption. I’m
not against the freshmen ball players

at all, but it’s a shame they have to be |

at the center of something as
unnecessary as this is.

I’m sure I speak for the whole
campus when I say that I, for one,
would like to see some sense displayed
in the workings on the basketball
court. No one likes to be humiliated,
or look disorganized, or feel dumb,
least ‘of all the Davidson Thirteen. Let
‘em play, but use your head, Coach.
