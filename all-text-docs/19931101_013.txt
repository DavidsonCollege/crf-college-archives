Still Whistlin' Dixie

Another great
one from George
Strait and band

By Geoff Graham

Easy Come Easy Go marks George
Strait’s eighteenth release into the realm of
Country music. That includes a Christmas
album, three greatest hits, and a motion
picture soundtrack.

In addition, George has ridden the ro-
deo circuit and starred in last year’s block-
buster, Pure Country.

What could be next for the superstar?
He might just write one of his own songs, but
don’t count on it.

George is one of the few popular Coun-
try singers who writes none of his own
material, But, before you criticize his au-
thenticity, keepin mind that he is also one of
the few popular Country singers who can
rope or ride.

We can view George’s aversion to the
pen and pad in two ways: Either he’s just
another joker with a hand-me-down guitar
and a decent voice, or the man’s got real
talent.

His longevity tends to support the latter
explanation.

George is a great performer with a fan-
tastic voice. More than likely, he realizes,
unlike many in the industry (Brooks and
Dunn, Sawyer Brown, and occasionally
Dwight Yoakam, toname a few), that every-
one benefits from the exploitation of a good
songwriter’s ability.

We not only hear exceptional songs,
performed by an extraordinary artist, we
avoid a couple of pitfalls. We don’t have to
hear George embarrass himself with a poorly
written song, and we don’t have to hear
songwriters, tempted to perform, embarrass
themselves with poorly sung, yet well-writ-
ten tunes.

Teamwork is the moral here. It makes
the world go ‘round. George gives the
writers a job, the writers give George a job,
we buy the albums, and everybody smiles.

Easy Come, Easy Go is another testa-
ment to teamwork’s success. George, once
again, enlisted the aid of veteran songwriters
(Jim Lauderdale, Steve Dorff, Dean Dillon,
among others) to produce another great one.
As far as tunes bound for his fourth greatest
hits album, Easy Come Easy Go is pregnant
with possibility.

The title track, which you may have
heard on the radio (it’s being overplayed
into oblivion), will definitely reappear some-
time. It’s a slow, plucked song, and a good
dance tune. “Without Me Around” is suspi-
ciously reminiscent of Garth Brook’s “What
She’s Doin’ Now.” Same subject, same
style, same calibre. This might be the next
one to hit the air waves.

“The Man In Love With You” is
Everyman’s love song to the woman he
knows he doesn’t deserve. If “I Cross My.
Heart” gave you chills, expect the same
from this one. With the exception of one
song, the rest solidly support the album.

“Lovebug” is the only stain on Easy
Come Easy Go. Happy and bouncy are two
adjectives you might associate with this
one. If George appears on “Sesame Street”
sometime:soon, I’m sure he’Il play it.

Expect to hear George Strait for years
to come.

~ He won’t burn out as long as he keeps
his resources tapped and flowing.

Buy the album. It’s worth it, just like
the last one, and the one before that, and the
one before that. Until next time, vaya con
dios. ee ag '

Strange days: The short career of The Doors

By Rachel Newcomb —

It is difficult to find‘an ex-
cuse to write about a band that is
no longer viable— a band that
not only doesn’t rehash old hits
at reunion tours, but hasn’t re-
leased an album of new material
since 1971. The Doors had a
brief but profound impact upon
the music scene, but their place
in music history is often ma-
ligned. “Light My Fire” is over-
played on classic rock stations,
and Jim Morrison has been dis-

missed by critics as an amateur-
ish lyricist who wrote nothing
better than junior high poetry.
Looking beyond the greatesthits,
there is a wealth of well-crafted
Doors songs that showcase the
band’s uniqueness and distinct
sound. Jim Morrison, the Doors’
charismatic frontman whose life
gradually spiralled to destruc-
tion, wasan extremely enigmatic
figure as well.

In 1965, Morrison was a
drifter who had recently dropped

out of U.C.L.A. film school a
week before he was to receive
his diploma. A loner by nature,
he read voraciously everything
from Nietzsche to Dylan Tho-
mas to Jack Kerouac. He wrote
extensively as well, keeping
notebooks since his high school
years full of poetry, personal re-
flections, and philosophical
musings. When he met
keyboardist Ray Manzarek at
U.C.L.A. film school, they
formed the nucleus of what was

to become The Doors. Adding .
John Densmore on the drums
and Robby Krieger on guitar,
they began to play in small clubs
around Los Angeles. The band’s
name was derived from two
sources: an Aldous Huxley es-
say entitled “The Doors of Per-
ception” detailing Huxley’s ex-
periments with LSD, anda quote
from poet William Blake, “If
the doors of perception are

Chuck Davis aims
to preserve African
dance traditions.

By Josh Larned

On Friday, November 5, Davidson
College welcomes the African-American
Dance Ensemble to Love Auditorium. Per-
forming under the leadership of renowned
director Chuck Davis, the group’s mission
is to “preserve and share the finest tradi-
tions of African and African-American
dance and music through research, educa-
tion, and entertainment.”

Indeed, Chuck Davis and his talented
troupe have overwhelmingly achieved these
goals, as evident in the far-reaching reputa-
tion they have gathered for themselves in
the African-American dance community.
Their hodgepodge of rhythmic percussion,
song, and costume (all derived from tradi-
tional African setting) provide a unique
learning experience for those unfamiliar
with this cultural heritage.

The African-American Dance En-
semble originated from Davis’s own vi-
sionary mind in 1964, upon witnessing a
performance of the Senegalese National
Dance Company at the New York World’s
Fair. At this point, a desire was kindled
within Davis (who was studying dance at
the time) to devote himself to the study of
African dance. He sought to capitalize
upon this dream by forming the much-
heralded Chuck Davis Dance Company in
1968. After studying in West Africa during

Africa or Love?

The African-American Dance Ensemble will bring its traditional dance style to
Love Auditorium on November 5. The group is led by reknowned director

Chuck Davis.

the late 1970s, he and his company began to
collaborate increasingly with the organizers
of the American Dance Festival, located in
Durham, North Carolina. Out of this rela-
tionship developed the African-American
Dance Ensemble in 1984.

Witnessing the AADE is quite an expe-
rience, as their energy and ability to inter-
pret with clarity this very complex art form
create a celebratory atmosphere which en-
gulfs the audience. As a result, a mood of
spirit and cultural harmony pervades their
performance.

For those who are further interested in

the AADE, they will be holding a lecture
demonstration on Friday, November 5 at
10:30 a.m. in the 900 Room. The presenta-
tion will involve participation from inter-
ested members of the audience. According
to Cultural Events Director Suneya Gupta,
“it will be an excellent preview of the
evening’s performance.”

By all means go check out the African-
American Dance Ensemble if you have the
time and inclination to do so.

Their performance should prove to be
the best party at Davidson on Friday night.
Tickets are $3.00 for students.

Movie Review

Rudy is little more than an attack on the happy button

__ By Alex Crumbley

Do you get sentimental dur-
ing long-distance commercials?
Do you cry when bugs splat on
your windshield? When some-
one next to you in class makes a
bad grade, do you grab his hand,
look him in the eye, and say with
great sincerity, “I can feel your
pain?” If you answer “yes” to
any of these questions, head
straight for Movies at the Lake
and get your front row ticket for
Rudy, perhaps the most shame-
lessly sentimental, tear-jerking
movie ever made.

At the risk of giving away
the intricate, surprising plot, I’ll
go ahead and say that it’s about
this guy who wants to play foot-
ball for Notre Dame, works for a
few years, and finally gets on the
team. I write this because if you

. | couldn’t figure it out for your-

self in the first five minutes,
you’re probably not old enough
to read, anyway.

Rudy is the son of a factory ©

worker who is a big Notre Dame
fan, and he is raised all his life
watching them play on televi-
sion. His dream is to play for
Notre Dame, but it seems that a
door closes in his face every
timehe tries torealize that dream.
He overcomes significant ob-
stacles, and finally finds suc-
cess. The true story that Rudy
relatesis impressive, butif you're
looking for the nineties version
of Hoosiers or The Natural, this
just ain’t it.

The film does have its
strengths. It is the story of the
power of the human will, the
unfairness of the world, the cour-
age it takes to chase down your
dreams. The themes and lessons

it presents are valuable, and I
must admit I cameout ofit really
motivated to go try out for the
Wildcats. But its problems are
so distracting that it is often
laughable.

Besides its overt sentimen-
tality, Rudy’s problem is that too
much plot is crammed into too
short a time. Each scene in-
cludesa major new development
in the story, leaving no time for
any of the characters to act natu-
rally, like real people. The dia-
logue is similarly lacking; the
longest sentence to come out of
Rudy’s mouth is, “I can do it,
coach, I know I can!” Yes, this
is the football version of “The
Little Engine That Could.”

Also, the film achieves mini-
mal characterization, to the point
that everyone in it is a stock
character. They include the dis-

couraging father, the meek
mother, the supportive best
friend, the jealous brother, the
unfaithful girlfriend, and, of
course, the kind coach whosees
something great in wormy little
Rudy. Rudy himself really isn’t
believable because he takes
years of abuse and discourage-
ment and only once considers
giving up. Because Rudy has no
weaknesses save his background
and his small size, the conflicts
which develop are almost ex-
clusively external.

These problems combine to
make Rudy a failure. If you
really want to procrastinate,
you’ve already seen Malice, and
you wept when Punky
Brewster’s dog got run over,
you may want to sit in on Rudy.
Otherwise, wait a couple of

‘weeks until it’s out-on video.
