just 15 field goals off that record.
“It’s getting closerto the wire,”

said Kirsch. “I just want to leave

on a good note.”

Pacing the conference

With Kirsch leading the way,
several Davidson. players stand
atop the conference in different
statistical categories.

Kirsch leads the conference in
scoring with a 16.1 average and is

free throws at- ©

Marshall, sheis —

fourth in rebounding at a 7.9 clip.
With these impressive numbers,
she is a likely candidate for confer-
ence Player-of-the-Year, which
will be announced this week.

Junior Jennie Vanlerberghe,
who earlier this season set the all-
time school record for blocked
shots, leads the league in that de-
partment with 38.

She had three on Saturday
against Marshall while playing
against 6-foot-7 Erika Fall.

Rookie Jen O’Brien is sec-
ond in the conference in assists
(87) while sophomore Jamie
Brown ranks fourth in that cat-

egory.

Despite the disappointing loss,

there were some positives for the
Wildcats.

In an interesting twist, the first :

three Davidson baskets were scored
by the departing seniors.

Kirsch opened the Wildcat
scoring with a layup off a Monica
Winter feed, Amy Scalcucci fol-
lowed with a putback, and Winter
scored Davidson’s third bucket off
of a steal...

In the race for the free televi-
sion, Phi Delta Theta thoroughly
dominated. No other group came
close to the fraternity’s enthusi-
asm and boisterious behavior. Con-
gratulations to Phi Delt...

Saturday’s crowd of 1,328 was
the highest figure this season.

Seniors come up big in Belk farewell

By Danie, Motz
Staff Writer

Seniors Jay Ariail and
Narcisse Ewodo were honored in
a pregame ceremony on Saturday.

Since joining the Wildcats in
December, Ariail, a lineman for

the Davidson football team, has
provided the team with energy,
intensity, and much needed lead-
ership. Coach Bob McKillop re-
warded Ariail for his fine efforts
by giving him his first career start
on Saturday.

Ewodo has been a fixture i in
the Wildcat program since his ar-
rival three years ago. His versatil-
ity, hard work, and quiet leader-
ship will be sorely missed. Ewodo
certainly did not go out quietly,
scoring the game-winning basket

in his final game at Belk. Heroic
actions to some, not so to Cisco.

“Hero is a big word,” said
Ewodo. “I’m just happy to be part
of this basketball team.”

Post-season honors

Several Wildcats could be in
the mix when the Southern Con-
ference announces its post-season
accolades this week.

Langry Kosmalski is all but
assured of win-
ning Fresh-
man-of-the-
Year honors,
averaging a
solid 13.0
points a game
and grabbing
7.6 boards an
outing. But

Kosmalski__
Kosmalski’s efforts should not
overshadow fellow freshman
Stephen Marshall. His 6.1 points
and 3.2 rebounds may be enough
to earn him a spot on the All-

Freshman squad. /
Mr. oye Ewodo,
a should be a
candidate’ for
first team all-
conference. He
averages 15.8
points and 6.5
rebounds, two
assists, andtwo
steals a game. |

Mark
Donnelly is also a potential candi-
date for all-conference honors. His
13.8 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.7
assists have been big for the Wild-
cats all year.

And let’s not forget Ali Ton.
While honors may be a year away,
his efforts this season should not
gounnoticed. He leads the confer-
ence in assists (6.8 apg) and in
assist-turnover ratio...

Chadd Holmes has saved the
best for last. In his past three
outings, he has averaged 15 points
and five rebounds.

Motz from Lexington, Va., and
Davidson.
