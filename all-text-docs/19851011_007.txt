Cats continue slump

By MIKE ADAMS

The Furman Paladins ran up a
35-0 lead in the first half en route
to giving the Davidson football
team a 58-7 walloping at
Richardson Stadium on Saturday.

Furman flanker Chas Fox con-
tributed greatly to the Wildcat’s
woes with 6 receptions for 115
yards in the first half. Three of his
catches went for touchdowns, in-
cluding an 11-yard score on the
Paladins first drive of the game.

The Cats were overmatched
both offensively and defensively
by Furman. The Paladins piled up
374 yards rushing and 179 yards
passing, while Davidson had only
186 yards of total defense.

Junior Jack McCollum started
quarterback for Davidson. He
completed 3 of 8 passes for 28
yards and rushed for 23 yards on 5
carries. The Cats could generate
no offensive momentum under
him, however, and he was re-
placed by sophomore Charlie
Winborne in the second quarter.
Winborne completed 3 passes in 6
attempts while throwing an inter-
ception.

Junior Steve Bradley directed
the Cats’ offense in the second
half. He completed only 8 of 22
attempts, but he did help salvage a
little Wildcat pride with an 80-
yard third quarter scoring drive.

Davidson’s soccer team suf-
fered through a frustrating week
that saw the team have a winless
week for the first time in a month.

What made the week espe-
cially frustrating is that Davidson
didn’t play poorly in either game.
Last Saturday, Davidson lost to
Furman 2-1. On Monday, David-
son tied UNCC 0-0.

The week left Davidson 4-5-2
on the season. The Cats are still 2-
0 in the conference because Fur-
man and Davidson are in opposite
divisions.

By RAND HARTSEL
The outcome last Saturday in
Pembroke, North Carolina was a

familiar one: Davidson’s
women’s cross-country team-
first, the opposition . . . well

you’re all Davidson students, you
figure it out. The men’s team sur-
prised itself for the second week in
a row, finishing behind Pembroke
State University (PSU). The race
served as the qualifying race for
the NAIA National Champion-
ship,

Senior Rob Watkins spoke for
the team when he commented, “It
was like one of those days when
you get in your occasionally unre-

tempts on the share-the-wealth
drive which saw four receivers
catch passes. Senior Jay Poag —
back after missing the Newberry
game because of an injury —
caught 2 passes. Freshman Bryan
Overcash also caught two passes,
including a superb catch in traffic
for a first-down. Sophomore Don
Davis made a leaping catch for
another first down on the new
play. Sophomore Aaron Edwards
got the touchdown when he beat
his defender by two steps to get
open in the end zone.

The Cats were again restricted
to a passing only offense. The
Davidson rushing attack netted
only 30 yards on 27 carries.

Despite the 58-7 score, the
Wildcats did not have a really bad
defensive effort. Furman just had
too many offensive tools to use.

Junior defensive end Marcus
Allen was the Cats defensive
leader on the basis of one first
quarter tackle. On their first play
at their third possession of the
game, the Paladins attempted a
sweep to Allen’s side. Allen read
the play perfectly and was waiting
for the unfortunate Furman
ballcarrier when he turned the
corner. Allen, who at 6’1” and
225 pounds, bench presses 435
pounds, hit the ballcarrier chest
high with an audible crunch heard
to the far corners of Richardson

Stadium.

Senior defensive back Tony
Smith also played well. He made
several unassisted tackles on Fur-
man sweeps.

One way in which the
superiority of Furman took its toll
on Davidson was in the rash of in-
juries suffered by the Cats. For
awhile in the second half it ap-
peared as if Davidson might run
out of warm bodies to finish the
game.

The Cats travel to Charleston
on Saturday to play the Citadel.
This game should prove to be
another tough one for Davidson.
The rest of the October schedule
looks no better with games again
Pennsylvania — the 1984 Ivy
League Champs — and James
Madison.

Bradley completed 6 of 10 at-
tempts on the share-the-wealth
drive which saw four receivers

catch passes. Senior Jay Poag —
back after missing the Newberry
game because of an injury —
caught two passes. Freshman
Bryan Overcash also caught two
passes, including a superb catch in
traffic for a first down. Sopho-
more Don Davis made a leaping
catch for another first down on the
new play. Sophomore Aaron Ed-

wards got the touchdown when he-

beat his defender by two steps to
get open in the end zone.

Sophomore Don Bergsma shows his soccer acumen.

UNCC stop cats in their tracks

game matched the two teams most
likely to reach the conference title
bout. Yet if this game was a pre-
view of the conference champion-
ship, Davidson will again fail to
net a Southern Conference title.
The key play in the first half,
and possibly in the game, came
after twenty minutes of play. Fur-
man controlled the ball near
Davidson’s goal. In the midst of
the melee, a Furman player was
fouled in the penalty box and Fur-
man received a penalty kick. The
call was unusual because the
linesman, not the referee, whis-
tled for the foul. Furman took ad-

a

liable, always unpredictable car,
push the accelerator to the floor,
and sputter down the road at 25
miles per hour.”

PSU runners capitalized on
the Cats’ off day, placing first and
third through sixth, totaling an im-
pressive 19 points. Only junior
Greg Foreman’s second place
could break up Pembroke’s domi-
nation of the first five places.

Foreman’s five mile time of
26:47 was his fastest ever on the
Pembroke course and his second
fastest time ever for five miles.
Senior captain Frank Hague, Wat-
kins, freshman Bill Whitfield and
sophomore Bill Breidenstine

vantage of the penalty and had a I -
0 lead.

“Falling behind hurts our de-
fense,” coach Charlie Slagle said.
“When we are behind, we are
forced to spread our defense out.
Falling behind allowed Furman to
dictate the style of defense we
needed to play.”

In the second half Davidson
knotted the score at one apiece on
a direct free kick by sophomore
Steve Ott. Davidson had been at-
tacking well all game, but was un-
able to score until Ott’s rocket.

The tie didn’t last long. Fur-
man got a fast break moments

placed seventh, eight, ninth and
eleventh respectively; but while
this represents very tight team rac-
ing, the Cats produced too little,
too late.

For the women, sophomore
Kappa Peddy dominated the field.
Campbell University produced
the second place runner, answer-
ing Peddy’s victory. Senior cap-
tain Judy Dalton was third overall,
breaking 20 minutes for the first
time over a three mile course.
Sophomore Laura Fannin was
Davidson’s next runner in sixth
place, and Davidson's victory
looked wrapped up. But Campbell
countered, placing seventh, eight

later and score on a diving header
made possible by an unblocked
cross from left wing.

“We're vulnerable to quick
counter attacks because we aren't
the fastest team around,” Slagle
said. “They executed that break
well and got a solid goal. We had
our chances in the game. We just
need to finish better than we
have.”

The Davidson-UNCC game
consisted mainly of struggles in
midfield and missed  oppor-
tunities. Both teams had chances
to score, but failed. Senior Sean
Austin had header stopped by the

and ninth, prolonging the Cats’
wait. It was prolonged no longer
as sophomores Morrow Reeves
and Sarah Langly closed out the
Cats’ victory and its fourth con-

secutive NAIA District Cham-
pionship.
The women's team most

likely will not be allowed to repre-
sent the district in Kenosha, Wis-
consin due to an NAIA rule pre-
venting a district's champion from
participating at nationals unless
the district qualifying race has
four or more teams. Since neither
the men’s nor the women’s races
included four complete teams,
only the top five individuals from

inside of the post. Junior goalie
Jim Kelly barely deflected a
UNCC shot in overtime to pre-
serve the 0-0 tie.

Unfortunately for Davidson,
freshman Tracy Hankins broke a
bone in his foot and will miss at
least two weeks. Hankins had
started the last three games for
Davidson and will be missed.

Sunday, Davidson hosts Geo-
rgia State, ranked IIth in the
South. On Tuesday, Davidson
hosts North Carolina State. N.C.
State is currently ranked 7th in the
nation.

ify for NAIA National Championship

each race will be selected to run at
nationals. Foreman (second over-
all in the men’s race), Peddy and
Dalton (first and third overall in
the women’s race) will represent
the district.

The Cats are idle this
weekend. Their next race is slated
for Thursday, October 17 in
Raleigh. The men will want to av-
enge their loss to PSU while the
women will fend off another chal-
lenge by Campbell. The meet is
the North Carolina collegiate
cross-country championship,
which includes teams from all
North Carolina colleges.
