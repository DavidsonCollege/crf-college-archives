THE DAVIDSONIAN

Spring break, sex & skimpy tops

There is a new resort/summer
look emerging on this season’s high
fashion runways, evident in the re-
emergence of the midriff-bearing
shirt. Anne Klein, Todd Oldham,
and Karl Lagerfeld are but a few
among a slew of famous designers
exhibiting such midriff-bearing en-
sembles in their annual repertoire.
Even Davidson is not immune to

such lofty trends, as isolated inci-

dents of this look are slowly pop-
ping up on campus.

In Fashion magazine at-
tributes this phenomenon to the
post-grunge, post-seventies evo-
lution towards fashion that is more
punk in nature. The midriff-bear-
ing tops are able to display many a
sexy pierced belly button and, with
even hipper hip-skimming pants,
perhaps a funky tatoo or two. If
this prediction of punk comes true
(which I promise you it will), we
had all better start saving our safety
pins. But that’s another other ar-
ticle.

Readers, do not be alarmed,
however; consumers always re-
ceive a more “watered-down” ver-
sion of the shocking that apparel
debuts on fashion runways. For
example, even the mainstream
mecca mail-order mag J. Crew
boasts a few outfits that combine
the midriff-bearing top with flow-

ing full-cut pants for an absolutely
stunning, airy look.

A quick way to try out this
look without blowing any cash or
getting skimpier than you want to
be is to take a flowing shirt of a soft
material and unbutton it until you
see some semblance ofa belly but-
ton. Another option is to do the
same thing with a slightly over-
sized or undersized vest.

Since these tops are not only
chic but sexy and warm-weather
friendly, I took to the halls of Cham-
bers to find out how many women
packed this item of apparel in their
spring break suitcases.

However, save Jane Brock, I
found no others brave enough to
try such a look on their respective
journeys. Disappointed by this lack
of midriff enthusiasm, | thought
I'd find out if anyone at Davidson
took anything sexy at all with them
on spring break...

Nathan Seay: My leopard skin
tighty-whitey underwear. (But
what about your dress, Nathan?)
Ben Hayes: My jammies with
footies in them.

Jo Burrows: My boyfriend.
George Ramsey: My long under-

wear (she’s going to the moun-
tains).

Dr. Webb: Nothing!

Harrison Roberts: Most of my
underwear is pretty damn sexy!
(We're glad you think so, Harrison.)
Jeffrey Hart: My stationwagon.
Bill Richards: My personality.
Amy Palmer: Red lacy underwear
Mike Kessler: My rubber
duckie...ever since my mother gave
it to me when I was two, I have
always had it with me when! bathed
and during any intense experience.
Jenn Williams (aptly summing it
all up): Myself.

Finally, any of you lucky
Davidsonians who travelled a little
further this spring break might have
seen what’s hot where we’re not:
Milan and London: 3/4 length
brown suede jackets, preferably
used.

London: Tie-dyed pants with china
flats.
Milan: Vest dresses, worn unbut-

toned two-thirds of the way up,

over long slim skirts.

‘Amsterdam: A fun place, but not

very hip—the “Chris-Cross” look
is (puke) in.

Everywhere: Customized jeans,
painted and drawn on, fringed or
striped; platform shoes; black
leather shoulder bags and back-
packs.
