Highlights From Governance Text

INTRODUCTION

The Governance Conmimit
tee was established by the
Trustees to examine the
structure of college gover-
nance, review the Faculty
Gonstitution, Code of Respon-
sibility, and related docu-
ments previously given
tentative’ approval, and to
make such recommendations
as it deemed desirable.

Though it has not yet»
completed this task, it is
ready at this time to pre-
sent its report and recom-
mendations in the first area
of concern, that of student
conduct and judicial proce-
dures.

The committee has re-
viewed the Code of Respon-
sibility and has also heard
testimony from faculty, staff,
and students about the cur
rent state of student con
duct. It is apparent that al-
though the Code is sound as

a Statement of — philosophy
and standards, enforcement
of sanctions against viola-

tors is honored more in the
breach than in the
vance,

The Goverance Committee
has come to three conclus-
jons on which its recommen-
dations are based: 1) that the
Code of Responsibility. with
relatively minor modifica-
tions, represents a desirable
and acceptable standatd of
expectations in the area of
student. conduct: 2) that” au
thority and responsibility for
measures to implement the
Code should rest directly with
the President. and 3) that
new and clear-cut procedures

In an interview, this was
the hypothetical situation
which Terry used io illus-
trate the worknig of the new
judiciary system.

In another situation ‘errs
explained how the case. is

cides he doesn’t want the
dean to handle the case.

Fred Stone, a_ hall coun-
selor on Third Cannon, com-
plains to Terry thet Phil
Black has’ been smoking
marajuna on the hall.

Terry does some _investi-
gation and finds there are
other witnesses to Black’s
actions. Feeling that action
is warrented, Terry notifies
Black of the ddministrative
conference.

He tells Black that any-

thing he says may be used
against him in disciplinary
proceedings. “| am prepared
to give you a maximum
sanction of definite suspen-
sion,” Terry says.
_ Believing that he can get
a lighter sentence from the
Hearing Committee Black
tells the dean he wants to
go to the student court.

The dean then terminates
the conference and notifies
the student solicitor of: the
charge.

Upon receipt of the re-
ferred charge the solicitor

notifies the secretary of the’

of the will to and means of

vised to make the Code
and accompanying _ regula-
tions’ more effective.

STANDARD OF
EXPECTATIONS

Section 2 of the college
charter provides that the
Trustees “‘are authorized to
make a constitution and laws
for the government of said
college, and the preservation
of order and good morals
therein.”

In accordance with this
provision, it is the responsi
bility of the Trustees to
establish standards of con-
duct and regulations for the
use of facilities which fur-
ther the educational purpose
of the college, guarantee the
health and safety of the
community, protect its pro-
perty, and preserve its good
name among its several con-
stituencies.

They do so in the convic-
tion that the actions of per
sons living in Community, and
especially (a) campus com-
munity, affeet
other persons in some way:
that the student
determine or affect
the geseral reputation of all
studen s and public’ attitudes
toward them and the college:

only on the academic repu
tation of the college but also
ity of the total life

but the latter may not. di-

judicial proceedings.

At the trial the student
solicitor reads the charge.
The chairman of the Hear-
ing Committee then asks
Black whether he admits to
the charge or not.

Black decides not to ad-
mit the charge. The com-
mittee then hears the evi-
dence in support of the
charge presented under the
direction of the solicitor.

Black and his defense ad-
visor present their evidence.
The Solicitor responds with
rebuttal evidence, afterwhich
rebuttal evidence is given by
Black and his dcfense ad-
visor.

Closing arguments are then
made by Black followed by
the solicitor.

In executive session, the
Hearing Committee then de-
termines whether a violation
as charged has occurred and
what sanction, if ‘any, to
impose.

Since Black has been
caught. several times smok-
ing marajuna, the conimittee
decides to impose the sanc-
tion of definite suspension.

peal to the Review Board if

LONG DAY’S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT

Trustees make their way to the 10 a.m. meeting.

the substantive portion of
the Code of Responsibility
(Preamble, Articles, I, II,
1V, and V) as amended.

RESPONSIBILITY
AND AUTHORITY

The Trustees recognize
that there are two separate
areas involved in. the man-
date to the Trustees of Sect-
jon 2 of the Charter. The
first has to do with the use
of college facilities.

In this area, regulations
having to do with the health,
safety and welfare of the
community and with the pro
tection of property should be
promulgated as administra-
tive matters.

The other urea has to do
with the larger) dimensions
of student conduct which are
more personal. In both areas,
provisions should be made
for consultation and part
cipation by faculty, staff, and
students, and = for specific
judicial mechanisms and pro-
cedures.

The Trustees specifically
delegate to the President the
authority and responsibility
for supervision and direction
in both areas, and direc: him
to devise the necessary re
gulations,~ mechanisms, and
procedures to achieve the ob-
jectives indicated herein.

In such case the student
solicitor will handle the case

To be sure that regulations
are observed, the trustees
said that each residence hall
will have a chief counselor
who will be responsible for
all activities in the dorms.

He may either handle vio-

lations by counseling or re-
fer the matter to the Dean of
Students.

The trustees also answered
the question of the use of.
definite and indefinite sus-
pension. Safeguarding against
such extreme sanctions, the
courts must have a_unani-
mous concurrence of sitting
members to impose cither
cf these sancticrs.
