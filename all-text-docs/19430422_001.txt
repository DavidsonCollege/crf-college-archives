Secrutinizing the paper left on a

by

committee on fraterni-

tics, the presidents and treasurers

of -nine—Davidson- social fraterni-
ties discussed with members of the
faculty and adminjstration the
problem of keeping open or clos-
ing the fraternities next year be-
cause of the war crisis,

The first problém tobe approach-
ed was that of disposing of the
fraternity Mr. F. L. Jack-
son, treasurer of the college, speak-
ing for the board of trustees, said
that he thought the board would
be unwilling to entirely the
houses for the duration, it
depends on rent derived from them
to fill out the college budget. He
said, however, that -he thought they
would be willing to make some re-
duction in the rent, work out
some plan of temporarily renting
them to other lessees until the fra-
ternities reopened, if they decided
to close.

Problem of Closing

The next problem to be ap-
proached was the actual délemma
of whether to close the fraterni-
ties entirely for the duration,
whether to try to struggle along
with the greatly reduced member-
ship that they will have next year.
Several chapters came out with
definite proposals of closing, giving
as their reasons the belief that re-
maining open would result in turn-
ing over the chapters to inexperi-
enced men next year which in turn,
would result in lowered standards.
Others expressed the desire to re-
main open, saying that there was
no reason for closing as long as
there were even a few members
left who were willing and capable
of carrying on.

Dr. Cunningham closed by ex-

lodges.
