Investigation Unearths
Sham Dictionary Firm

Editor-in-Chief

An advertisement that has
appeared in the last six issues
of THE DAVIDSONIAN ap-
pears to have been
misleading. The ad is one that
solicits orders for mail
delivered cut-rate, library-
sized Webster dictionaries and

. can be identified by the words

“Dictionaries Webster’ that
appear in bold type at the top.
Questions involving the ad
arose when Director of the
Student Store Peter Nicholls

noticed a on
report es
recent copy of the ‘National

Association of Stores
(NACS) Bulletin.”” The
bulletin quoted a

tative of Merriam-Webster
Publishers who said, “It’s a
spurious Webster, definitely
not our product. We believe
that the book offered in the ads
was published some time ago

under another title and now

renamed ‘Webster’.’
