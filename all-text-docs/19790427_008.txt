He storms through the halls
of Chambers, his felt-tipped pen
unsheathed and _= slashing
through misspelled words on
posters. In College Bowl! tourn-
aments he intimidates opposing
teams by greeting them in
classical Latin, and not only
does he know the answers to the
tos’-ups, on occasion he’s been
known to correct the questions.
When The Charlotte Observer
has any doubts as to the
definition of an obscure word,
Charles Lloyd is consulted.

Stuart Dim, managing editor
of The Observer, considers him
a two-legged Oxford English
Dictionary. Said Mrs. Billy
Graham after sitting in on one
of Lloyd’s Shakespeare classes
last spring, ‘‘He’s the C.S.
Lewis of Davidson.” Says Mr.
Lloyd, ‘‘GERRAE.’’ I reply,
“Sir?’’ Says Mr. Lloyd,
“UNSINN.” (Oh well).

I've been attempting to fig-
ure him out ever since I saw him
as I was wandering across the
-campus_on my first day here in
1976. I didn’t know who he was
or where I was or why he was.
But I thought he might be a
professor because he had grey
hair and was wearing a three
piece flannel suit-(it was ninety-
five degrees; I've heard he
wears it. while mowing the
grass). |
-. :D ran after him as he stroiled

-in of the union, a pack of
‘exotic dogs at his heels, a Phi
. Beta Kappa key glittering in
_ the sun and a pipe in his mouth

him and said,”Excuse me,

Dr...."’ He retorted, ‘I’m no
doctor. If you're ill, the infirm-
ary is across the street.”’

His dogs began barking in
Swahili while I apologized,
“Yes, sorry...sir., but could you
tell me where Belk dormitory is?
I'm new here.’’ He smiled and
tilted his face upward as if he
knew a metaphysical secret.

He said, ‘Like youthful steer
unyok'd, they take their cour-
ses/East, west, north, south;
or, like a school broke up,/Each
hurries toward his home and
sporting place."’ I nodded and
wondered if transferring to Da-
vidson had been such a good
idea after all.

Mr. Lloyd was born in Ala-
bama. He degan his college
studies at U.N.C.-Chapel Hill
at the age of fifteen. He reads in
thirteen languages and once
when he was introducing Brown
Patterson to a group of ‘stu-
dents he joked, ‘‘This man
knows everything. And I know
the rest."’ He can get away with
saying that because he really
doesn’t believe it, even if every-
one else does.

Before coming to Davidson
twenty-two years, ago, he held
an assortment of unusual jobs:
selling Comptons Encyclope-
dias (I suppose the O.E.D. was
a bit cumbersome to lug -door-
to-door), working for: Army
Intelligence (they say he would
crack the German code, correct
grammatical errors and then
send the messages back across
the Atlantic), and working with
the State Department in Intel-.

ligence after World War II. For .

a while he sold air conditioners.
His wife; Maude, said that ,

Mr. Lloyd decided to teach
when he realized that selling en-
cyclopediaes wasn’t lucrative
(this may be due to the fact that
when he'd introduce his product
he'd refer to it .as enkyklios
paideia).

As an English major, I know
what it’s like to read eight hours
in a day (I do this once a year,
the Friday before comprehen-
sives). I was curious as to how
much Mr. Lloyd reads each
day. I asked his wife. She
sighed, *‘Why, I don't know...
he reads continuously —at
breakfast he reads the back of
the cereal box or picks a scrap
bit of paper or a wrapper off the
floor and reads that. He reads
anything that has words on it.”’
| know this must be true and I
wish it were not.

I mean, how would you feel if
you were sitting in the front row
of his Shakespeare class and he
asked, “Patsy, have you read
The White Devil? No? The New
Machiavelli? No? The Hermit
and the Wild Women and Other
Stories? No? Well, how about
The Milk Train Doesn't Stop
Ilere Anymore? Gee, I wish I'd
read as little as you have. I'd
have so much to look forward
to.”

This year Mr. Lloyd planted
a garden for the first time.
Apparently he devoted much
careful thought and planning to
this endeavour because I re-
member him spending last
spring in clearing the jungle
from his -yard. It was so
over-grown that when he cut
back the elephant grass he
found a picnic table that had

_and the C.S. Lewis
of Davidson

A radisf planter,
scholar, and lover
of Shakespeare, he also

been missing for three years.

I asked his wife, ‘‘What did
Mr. Lloyd plant in his garden?”
She replied, ‘‘Radishes,"’ ‘‘And
what else?"’ I asked. She frown-
ed, ‘‘That’s it. And he doesn’t
even eat radishes. I had to
sneak outside while he was at
work and plant carrots, lima
beans, peas and lettuce.”

It’s a fact that Mr. Lloyd
does not like to be interviewed.
But gentleman and scholar that
he is, he granted me one
regardless. I walked into his
office one morning with my
notebook and he said, ‘‘Gode
morwe, Patsy. Sit down."

Then he dug into his coat
pocket and withdrew an AI-
mond Joy. ‘‘Would you like
half?’ I clicked open my pen.
‘No thank you, sir.’’ He un-
wrapped it anyway and ungum-
med a squashed bit of chocolate
from the cardboard.

It seemed a bit stale (the
chocolate was turning white) so
he tossed it in the trash and
gave me the rest of the candy
bar. He said, “‘O, throw away
the worser part of it,/And live
the purer with the other half.” °

1 asked Mr. Lloyd if he had a
favorite writer. ‘‘No,"’ he re-
plied, ‘I like too many to have
just one. However, C.S. Lewis
and Shakespeare are at. the top
of the list. I also respect P.G.
Wodehouse and Woody Allen.”

He paused to light his pipe
and then continued his answer
from behind a cloud of smoke.
“But there is one book I find
myself returning to more than
any.’ I leaned forward. ‘Yes
sir? Which?" “Treasure
Island" he said. “You know,

Patsy, I don't like being inter-
viewed."’ I nodded. ‘Yes sir, I
know. Do you have any favorite
painters?’’ He stood. ‘‘I like
Breughel. Now I must go. I
have to photocopy one of my
notorious vocabulary quizzes.”’

Mr. Lloyd paused at the door
and ran a finger down the list of
words. He smiled. ‘‘Do you
know what denture means?” I
felt a surge of confidence. ‘‘Yes
sir. A false tooth.”

He frowned and his face
looked so ominous with the
smoke swirling up around it
that I felt like Moses on Mt.
Ararat. ‘‘NO, it does not.
Venture is the aphetic form of
indenture. Originally a deed on
parchment was cut assunder in
a serrated line, so that when the
halves were eventually rejoined,
the edges would exactly tally,
thus verifying that they were
parts of the one and same
original document. They that
comen in Kynges name putt her
seals to that other part of the

endentures."*

Before Mr. Lloyd disappear-
ed down the hallway I touched
his sleeve and bade him to let
me ask him one final question. I
thought about the world beyond
Davidson. Was there one,
would | be part of it after
graduation, how could I become
wise sa I might presently have a
future? °

“Oh, tell me, Mr. Lloyd,
what should I do next?"’ He
scratched his head and _ raised
two fingers in a philosophical
gesture. “Repent what's past;
avoid what is to come;/And do
not spread the compost on the

_ weeds.” 3
