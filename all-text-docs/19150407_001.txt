Decision For Affirmative Is Won |Social and Personal Items About Forty-Four Schools From This Part

By Alexander and Roan.

Davidson seored a signal victory on
the intellectual gridiron last Monday
night when the Davidson teant, repre-
sented by U. S. Alexander and C. H.
Rowan, won the decision over Clemson
College in the Winthrop College Audi-
torium at Rock Hill.

Before a large attendance. which al-
most filled the newly enlarged and beau-
tied Winthrop auditorium. the teams
offered their contentions as to whether
Foreign Immigration into the United
States should be further restricted by
the imposition of a literacy test. In the
first round, and especially in the retuta-
tions, the arguments ot the Davidson
men proved unanswerable, and the de-
cision was rendered four to ane in favor
of the Red and Black team. At no
period in the debate did the outcome
seem in doubt, the masterful array of
facts and logic. bv the Davidson debaters
meeting successfully at every. point the
oratory of the Clemson team.

Before the commencement of the con
flict and while the judges. were handing
in their decisions, the Wintrop Glee Club
rendered several delightful selections,
which were well received and enjoved.

Dr. D. B. Johnson, President 01
Winthrop College. presided over the de-
bate, and made a few happy introductors
remarks. ‘Vhe debaters marched on the
platform amid the applause of the aud
ence and vells of the large Davidson dels
gation of 125° students. The entire
Winthrop student bady and many vist
ors from the town were present.

‘The debate under discussion was
“Resolved, ‘Vhat Foreign Immigration
into the. United States should be furthe:
restricted by imposition of a literacy
test.”

‘The first speaker to take the floor was
C. H. Rowan. of the affirmative — for
Davidson. In a clear and forceful man
ner he showed the recent changes in the
character of irnmigration, and the change
therefore in its problem. After a defi-
nition of the terms of the question, he
outlined clearly the issues, an then pro-
ceeded to show that there is need of fur-
ther restriction because of the oversup-
ply of unskilled labor in the countrt.
and the inability of American laborers to
compete with the new immigrants, prov-
ing these statements with convincing
facts and statistics.

The first speaker on the negative was
D. F. Folger. of Clemson. He held that
America has been and always should be
an asylum and refuge for the poor and
unfortunate, and argued that the ‘illit-
eracy test would keep out many worthy
immigrants and was not a fair method of
restriction.

U. S. Alexander. continuing the
affrmative argument. for Davidson, then
proceeded to show with strong, well pre-
pared arguments that the literacy test is
the logical test to bring about further
restriction, because of the industrial, so-
cial and political undesirabilitv of the
immigrants. He closed his debate with
the argument that the literacy test is a
feasible and practicable test showing the
restriction it would give, and the ease of
its application and favorable reaction on
the countries of the immigrants.

D. E. Swinehart, of Clemson. was the
last speaker of the negative, and endeav-
ored to show that the literacy test would
keep out immigrants we now need in our
industries, and made an cloquent plea to

Red and Black Defeats
Wofford by Good Score

Lawson Pitches Two-Hit Game---
Teammates Have Batting Bee.

Davidson pounced upon Wofford in
the secand game ot the season, April 5,
an the Rock Hill diamond, and deteated
them 7 tab. Phe diamond was a little
slow. due te the recent: rains, and the
wind was blowing rather fast for a ball
game, but notwithstanding these hin-
drances. the nine plaved first class. ball.

The game was the Red and Black's
jrom the beginning, and not onee. did
Wolford threaten to over tua the num.
ber repistered by them. “Vhe game was
featured by many chard dats for extra
bases, but ait happens that all of them
were obtained by the Davidson batters.
Lawson held Wolford down to two hits,
one of them being a scratch, Te struck
out cight men, and atlowed only one
man aitree trip te the initial sack. bls
pitching was superb. “Phe wind atfected
lis curve balls. but that did not hinder
him. since he had so many fast ones in
stare, Wofford travelled hitless until
the seventh faning, when Osborne man
aged te case one through Somerville.

Christenbursy started the game with a
hit, and it was the third time he dad
placed hat stunt this vear.

Crroanye was the Py Coh” for the
dav. He went te che bat four tines and
came down with a home run, a three-
base hit and aostingle. His four bagger
was at terrific clout over the center Held:
ers head, and there is ao telling how far
it would have gone, a the wind had nat
heen blowing, pust the wrang way,

Capttin Osborne was Wofford’s best
plaver scoring the only run and getting
one of the two hits.

Wofford’s anly run came in’ the
tourth. Osborne hit. hard grounder to -
Christenbury, who was unable to field
it: he was sacrificed to second and to
third, and came home when Lawson cut
loase a wild piteh,

Davidson outclassed their opponents
in every stage of the game, but Wofford
stuck te them, and caused them to work
hard at tines.

The Rack Hill peaple seemed very
much pleased with the Davidson team,
and although the crowd was small this
time, it is possible that on the 29th of
this month they will turn out better to

hwitness the game with South Carolina.
