When the Thunderstorm Comes

When the thunderstorm comes, I run .
To the fields to meet it.

I stand the topmost point in the-hill-top pasture

And wait utterly quiet, quite afraid.

tn the hollow autumn I hear

The crackling leaves in the trees below | ~

And they precede in imitation the rainless thunderings.
The rumble growis its way past

Each mound of dirt between

The skinny strands of straw

To me where I feel it in my toe-skin.

The thread-like divider of the skies

Suddenly flies towards me, the lightning rod;

And I--above all the timber-tremble.

Each would-be fatal arrow of light \
Misses me completely

Striking instead the marrowless hay.

And a calming rain turns to steam upon me

While I shiver from my damp hate for the thunderstorm.

14 February

Punctual as a well-trained executive,
predictable as a pre-timed vault lock,
the stiff old lady

walks her overwrought chihuahua.

I meet her on sunny mornings at 7:35.
She, wobbling with her cane in hand,
grins at me and

the chihuahua yaps fiercely.

One morning the dog, sandy haired
with nervous black eyes,

will strangle itself, eyes popping
from its leather leash.

But the tottering lady in her
hair tufts closed in a frayed kerchief,
will leave her Cheshire grin floating in the air.
