A CALL FOR S8RVICE,

‘The largest initial enrollment in the
history of the college is an indication of
the bright future which is in store for
Davidson during this year. The work
already accomplished has shown that
practically without exception every old
man has returned filled with a determin-
ation to do his best, and the new men
are called upon to enter into this spirit
of the institution and make their work
count.

With the whole world changing over
night and with forces unloosed which
have shaken all governments, it is high
time that small things and personal prej-
udices be put aside and every man fully
realize his duty and responsibility as a
member of the student body.

Let there be no hesitation in putting
first things first. The prime object in
attending college is to gain the benefits
to be derived from the courses offered.
It is a grave mistake to allow anything
else to have right of way over this pur-
pose.

After this comes the call of various
student activities, and no man should fail
to take part in at least one of these in-
terests. One, two, or even more of the
things which offer attraction should be
chosen, and no matter what are the ob-
stacles, nothing should stand in the way
of these ideals. ‘Tt may be the literary
societies, athletics, publications, or anv
one of a number of things, but the goal
should he decided upon and then let
“proficiency” be the watchword. It is to
those who follow this course that the cal-
lege must look for its advancement and
the fulfillment of the high ideals of the
Davidson campus.

DR. ARBUCKLE HONORED.

At the bi-ennial convention of the Pi
Kappa Alpha fraternity. held in San
Francisco. August 3-6, Dr. H. B. Ar-
buckle, of the Davidson faculty, was
elected to the office of grand counselor,
the highest position in the gift of the
fraternity.

Dr. Arbuckle has always been an act-
ive worker in evervthing which he has
undertaken, and this recognition of his
ability is a well merited one.

Dr. Toash Yohannan’s ('11) mother
has died of fever in the midst of the Per-
sian persecution.

CAMPUS IMPROVEMENTS.

During the past summer the college
authorities have done much to make the
life on the campus more pleasant. The
halls of Georgia, Watts and Rumple
dormitories have been cleaned and re-
painted. A new floor has been placed in
Rumple dormitory. The rooms in the
south wing of Chambers have been fur-
nished and improved very much. In ad-
dition Shearer Hall and Martin Chem-
ical laboratories have: been provided with
steam heat. “The work on the Morrison
Memorial Hall has been completed and
the committee in charge only awaits the
arrival of the furniture to give the hall a
forfal opening. The rooms on the sec-
ond floor will be used as a Social Center,
Y. M. C. A. committee room, ana for
the Applied Mathematics department.

‘The old store room on the second floor
of Chambers is being prepared for an ad-
ditional Physics laboratory. The new
residence being built on Concord avenue
for Dr. Arbuckle is about completed.
The walks on the campus are being cov-
cred with a course of sand, new drains
are being opened, and the grass on the
campus has been mowed.

The golf course is in very much better
shape than it ever has been. The tennis
courts are to be improved and remade.
This will give every one a chance to
play tennis at any time.

After the college has done so much for
the students it is hoped they will do all
possible to keep the campus in good shape.

LITERARY NOTES.

All of the old men of Davidson know
what a great benefit is derived from the
library. And now to the new men, espe-
cially, the library offers a hearty wel-
come. Miss Shaw, the librarian, will al-
ways be glad to talk with you concerning
anything which pertains to the library.

This year the reading room will be
open from 8:30 a. m. to 8 p.m. The
library will be open from 12 m. to 6 p.
m., except on Monday, when it will be
open from 10 a. m. to 6 p. m.

The library has added about 125 new
books to its list during the last few
months. Among these are the chief mag-
azines, which were in the reading room
last ‘year, very neatly bound, each book
containing the year’s issue of the maga-
zine. There will also be found several
copies of the most up-to-date modern fic-
tion, and several books dealing with the
present war, such as: .

“India and the War,” by Lord Svden-
ham; “The German Enigma.” by
Georges Bourdou; “World in Crucible,”
by Parker; “With the German Armies
in the West,”” bv Hodin; ‘Germany and
the Germans.” bv Collier; “Russia and
the World,” by Graham; “When Blood
Ts Their Argument,” by Hueffer and
Lord Maddox, and “Diplomatic Docu-
ments Relating to European War,” pub-
lished in London.

LITERARY SOCIETIES.

The subject and the material for the
debates on Saturday night may be found
in the library. Suitable subjects for
declamation may also be found there,
and Miss Shaw will be glad to assist
any once in getting these up.
