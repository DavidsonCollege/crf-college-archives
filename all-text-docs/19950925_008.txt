Calling on the spirit of Hall Morrison

I hail from Lexington, North
Carolina (as my roommate often
enjoys reminding me), nestled deep
in the heart of Davidson County.
Yes, Davidson County, named for
our beloved General William Lee
Davidson, the namesake of this
institution. When I return home on
breaks and people ask me where I
attend school, I proudly say
“Davidson.” On one too many
occasions, they inquire “Davidson
County Community College?”, a
distant cry from the academic
prowess the halls of Chambers
breed. This mix-up of institutions
used to bother me, as it obviously
still bothers people like Mary
Wampler and Tehnez Parakh.
Nowadays, this confusion doesn’t
blow me over. I know what kind of
an education I am getting here at
Davidson, an education that may
help guide me into the residency of
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or a

lifetime of leadership and service.
I know my Davidson education is
founded on the successes of Dean
Rusk and half of the lawyers, bank-
ers, doctors, and other leaders I
meet.

The study of study

A brilliantly conceived scene
of Aristophanes’ The Clouds finds
Socrates, the center of the comic
play, gazing intensely at the mo-
tions of the stars and planets, study-
ing their revolutions and patterns.
So intensely, in fact, that he is
unaware of his impending doom: a
hovering bird dumps his feces on
Socrates head. The suggestion is
satirical; Socrates busies himself
with the study of what’s around
him and finds great joy and fulfill-
ment in it. But the implication is
that he remains totally ignorant of
“real world” facts and circum-
stance, He is “somewhere else.”
Neither he nor the results of his
* study can have any value because
they are not applicable to prob-
lems of the world; knowledge is
only food for Socrate’s mind. A
deep suggestion of this passage is
that those who view learning as an
end inand of itself are foolish; they
live in “ivory towers.” I'd like to
explore this perspective and what
our relation to it may be.

There seems to be a growing
preoccupation, on our campus at
least, with the practical applica-
tion of whatever it is that we’re
learning here. This is not directed
to the seniors who are hoping to
use their degrees to land gainful
employment upon graduation, nor
is the source of this observation for
the future engineers and other ap-
plied scientists who study at
Davidson. For these people prac-
ticality is an obviously valid con-
cern.

What Iam trying to pinpointis
an attitude that permeates the aca-
demic aura of Davidson, an atti-
tude that counters al] that our
founders surely wanted a college
_education to mean for its students.

Much of what we learn seems
to have no further usefulness other

than simply allowing us to learn
more in the same area. For ex-
ample, the study of pure math-
ematics does almost nothing for us
other than make it possible to study
and learn more about mathematics
at deeper and more complex lev-
els. Again, these pure concepts are
often used to match patterns we
find in everyday life and give us
some practical application for what
we learn. A pure mathematician,
however, goes no further than ex-
actly that: pure mathematics.

* The idéa of pure anything is a

very unattractive one to many stu-
dents at Davidson. What is this
good for? Why would I ever need
to know this? These are questions
that run rampant throughout the
academic endeavors taking place
daily on campus. These questions
may not be totally unfounded or
unjustified, for it stands to reason
that one should not spend time
concerning himself with some
pointless endeavor. But here lies
the crux of the issue. There is a
strange lack of desire on the part of
many Davidson students to con-
sider learning as an end in and of
itself, not as a means to a particular
end. This is a troubling matter
because it seems as though our
entire notion of thought has be-
come dramatically no longer some-
thing to be enjoyed. It cannot be
rewarding in itself. It is only a
chore through which we reach
something truly fulfilling. Of
course it is always appropriate to
ask yourself, “What does this
mean?” about what you’ ve learned,
to find some knowledge about your
knowledge. To ask yourself “How
can this help me?” is a different
question which, though truly use-
ful, can often lead us to forget. all
the good about learning for the
sake of learning.

all about. Allow them to discover
us. Have faith that they will do so.

makes this institution seem hol-
low, without substance.

It is all in the words of
Davidson’s first president, Robert
Hall Morrison, who in 1838 graced
Davidson’ first students with true
words of wisdom. I pass these
words on to you: “Those who
estimate the worth of a college
solely by the number and height of
its buildings, the extent of the li- -
brary, the apparatusandtheamount |
of money expended in its support,
will probably, for many years think
but little of this institution. But
those who prize sound instruction,
virtuous habits and Christian prin-
ciples as the most essential con-
stituents in forming excellency of
character will, no doubt, rejoice in
the increasing evidence of pros-
perity, and pray for our continued
success.” It seems that Davidson
could use a few more Morrisons
here in 1995. :

I was shocked, dismayed, and
disturbed by the caption and photo
credit which appeared under the
map of China in last week’s
Davidsonian, both of which re-
ferred to me, more or less by name.
The subtle sexism and question-
able attempt at humor of the cap-
tions were made all the more ironic
by the fact that they were intended
to accompany an article on the UN
Fourth World Conference on
Women in Beijing, a conference
which dealt with, among other
things, the presentation of women
in the media.

The Davidsonian editorial
staff was promptly and, I believe,
genuinely apologetic, and at this
point, I am long past feeling per-
sonally offended by the incident.
It does, however, fit into a larger
pattern of behavior at Davidson
that begs for attention.

At Davidson, we have suc-
cessfully eliminated most of the
institutional and formal barriers to
gender equality — both women
and men succeed in the classroom,
provide leadership for campus or-
ganizations, edit publications, com-
pete on the athletic field, cheer on
our teams, and contribute in nu-
merous other ways to the rich fab-
ric of our community. For these
important strides we have many
students, faculty, staff, and admin-
istrators, both past and present, to

thank. We are now faced with
more subtle, informal patterns of
sexism and gender stereotyping
that are difficult to recognize,
nearly impossible to “legislate” out
of-existence, and very powerful in
setting the tone of male-female
interaction here. Obscenities
spelled in Christmas lights on a
fraternity roof. Party flyers bear-
ing the image of scantilly clad
women ... perhaps in clearly sub-
missive poses ... or hung only in
men’s bathrooms. Captions inThe.
Davidsonian. A senior party fea-
turing the Bud Light Girls. A skit
in which our woman Wildcat was
carried off, flailing, by two male
Wildcats. You get the picture.

In the words of The
Davidsonian editors, we must rec-
ognize the significance of “the
subtle and incessant messages fed
to us every day, usually under the
guise of innocent fun” (Editorial 9/
18/95). ’ mnotimplying that all of
these examples of subtle sexism
are intentionally demeaning to
women. I suspect that many of
them are not, that most occur with-
out too many people thinking much
about what they are doing, and that
all of them, when pointed out, are
dismissed either as harmless fun or
as mere oversight. Humor and
oversight, however, can be trans-
mitters of deep and serious mes-
sages about the values of our soci-

ety. At what point does a joke
become more than a joke?

My point is that we are all
responsible for thinking about our
words and actions, as well as the
words and actions of others, criti-
cally. Too often at Davidson these
things slip by with a small reaction
perhaps, but little serious discus-
sion or response. In a small com-
munity, how do we help to free
each other from the shackles of
deeply rooted gender stereotypees?
How do we critique the actions of
those who we consider our friends

‘and colleagues? These questions

need to be discussed further, and
soon.

Again in the words of The
Davidsonian editors, “We are at
fault when we ... don’t think about
what [these images] represent (in
effect, condoning them).” If we
fail to recognize the subtleties of
the messages around us, we are
prey to them, and we risk being
shaped by influences of which we
aren’t even aware. A free and
egalitarian society requires more
than progressive laws and an edu-
cated citizenry (neither of which
we can take for granted). We are
all responsible for eradicating gen-
der inequality in our society —
here at Davidson, as well as in the
larger national and world commu-
nity. We are all responsible for
thinking.
