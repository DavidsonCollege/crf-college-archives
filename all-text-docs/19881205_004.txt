Stuart scholarship
undergoes changes

By DAVID BEARCE

Due to the amount of funds
available, the Stuart. Scholar-
ship program will be changed in
1990. Instead of offering three
full-year scholarships to incom-
ing freshmen, it will offer major
awards to Davidson juniors and
seniors.

The Edward Crosland Stuart
Scholarships are funded outside
of the Davidson College en-
dorsement. Itis “unlike internal
awards and scholarships,” ac-
cording to Executive Director
for Institutional Advancement

~ Julius Melton. Davidson Col-

lege has a “close-knit relation-
ship” with the Stuart Founda-
tion, and they have the “right to
alter their approaches,” Melton
added.

The Stuart Foundation has
been committed to Davidson
College since the death of Ed-

‘ward Crosland Stuart, a 1954

Davidson graduate. Despite

their financial difficulties due to

the rising cost in a Davidson

ae
WED

education, the Stuart Founda-
tion wants the scholarships “to
be meaningful,” added Melton.
This change was developed in

‘collaboration with Davidson in
order to, “maintain the presence
e honor” of the Stuart“

scholarships.
Other schools in the South-

tinue to attract top high school
. Students due to the “number of

east have large merit scholarship
programs. For example UNC-

CH has the Morehead Scholar-
ship, and Washington and Lee
has ten merit full-scholarships
per year. The lack of a big merit
scholarship does pose “a direct

threat to our top strata,” accord=

ing to Melton,
Nonetheless Davidson will be _
able to attract a lot of students —

with its smaller merit scholar- ral
ships. In addition there is a
“place in the upcoming cam- |
paign” to fill the gap left by the
modification of the Stuart schol-
arship program, remarked Mel-

ton.
Melton says that Davidson
must not ignore its principle of

meeting 100% of demonstrated —
financial need. The desire fore
new merit scholarships must not

detract from Davidson's com-
mitment to provide need-based
scholarships, he said. —

Says that the modific:

Stuart scholarships has “had
little bit of an effect.”
However, Davidson will con-

mnalies hae els 1

top 10% of high schoo seniors.

Tong speaks out at campus meeting
against “bad” pornography

By DELIA JOHNSON

Visiting distinguished Profes-
sor of Humanities Rosemarie
Tong spoke at the campus meet-
ing November 17 on the topic of
pornography and feminists’ at-
tempts to ban pornographic mate-
rial. Tong stated that many femi-

nists have encountered problems:

in their fight against pornogra-
phy.

Most feminists believe that
pornography relates more to male
power Over women than to sex.
Because feminists advocate sex-
ual freedom for women, they face
a dilemma: how to let women
continue to explore their sexual-
ity and at the same time stand
against pornography.

The dilemma was resolved by
dividing pornography into erot-
ica, “good porn,” which portrays
partners in an equal relationship,
and bad porn, “slice and dice,”
which pairs sex and violence.
Tong and others fear that bad porn
may lead to aggressive behavior
toward women. Any porn which
presents women as dumb, enjoy-

ing or deserving abuse and pro-
moting violence should be
banned.

It has been difficult to analyze
the two types of pornography and
to divide them into such groups.
For example, the Lockhart com-
mittee, the Presidential commit-
tee on pornography, found that
pornography does not necessarily
spur violent behavior.

The Lockhart committee relied
on experiments done by Dr.
Mosher in which men were shown
the two types of pornography and
asked a series of questions before
and after the films. The responses
were more aggressive after view-
ing the bad porn, but the commit-
tee found the results to be incon-
clusive because it was not certain
that the aggression was the result
of violent scenes or sex scenes.

Tong cited a case involving the
television drama “Born Inno-
cent,” shown by NBC, in which a
girl is “raped” with a coke bottle
by other girls. The day after the
drama was aired, a similar inci-
dent occurred in a school by girls

who had seen the movie.

There have also been prob-
lems in proving that porno-
graphic films defame women.
Tong defines defamation, ac-
cording to the law, as damage
done to a person’s reputation
by expressing opinions to a
third party. Pornography pro-
ducers argue that they are
merely presenting visions to an
audience and not making a
statement about women.

A final issue encountered by
feminists is the argument that
pornographic material is pro-
tected under freedom of
speech. Tong and others feel
that pornography “appeals to
the gut.”

Many women involved in
pornography as actresses and
models are in the same position
as Linda Martiano, (porn star
Linda Lovelace) whose hus-
band / director forced her to
participate. Most are involved,
according to Tong, because
they either need the moncy or
are forced into the role.

the athletic budget will remain
the same but will be transferred
internally to the other sports,” ex-
plained Pryor.

However, The Charlotte
Observer quoted Davidson reli-
gion professor David Kaylor as

“Saying that he doubts the savings

gained by dropping to Division
III will make much of an impact

The Gift of Water .

Toit

on women’s sports, Kaylor re-
marked, “I really. don’t see how
realistically there’s a major sav-
ings involved.”

Due to enthusiasm and peti-
tions from the club women’s soc-
cer team, Morris claims that his

department is considering adding —
‘a varsity women’s soccer team in

addition to its plans to “phase in”
swimming and diving programs.

on display from December 5-22

says that the move will have no
great impact overall on admis-
sion or admissions policies.
This year Davidson has ‘been
attracting swimming, diving,
and women’s soccer prospects
in anticipation of new varsity
sports to be added in the future.
In January the admissions of-
fice will write letters to those
prospective ‘students and: in-
form them of the: status of
sports at that time.
