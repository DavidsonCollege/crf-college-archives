The woman in me grew wise young
learned the woman’s parable

that birth comes hard, bleeds

and bends you: bleed with joy

for the man in me, this is hard

Your seasons are disturbed
for the child, ropes and births my lovely mother,

mean little, unless they lead for Spring has settled in with Autumn
to God, whose Voice 1S warm, and neither wants to leave.
multi-colored, and sincere I came home to join your harvest

and found new life upon your limbs,
eyes lined with freshness

you sparkle with silver

and I am awed.
Women so pregnant with dreams
have you found your season at last?

The Trinity’s no battle,
‘Mister Freud,

nor theologian’s Rubik’s cube.
The Trinity is me.

I remember aching restless rains

Did they nourish you?

Dog’s Prayer

On Saturday

me and you

scraped Skipper

from the road

with shovels.

His blood matted fur
cracked in the stillness
of the autumn traffic.

We dug a hole in the sand and clay
and made up some grown up things to pray.

On Sunday

me and you |
passed notes

and drew pictures
of Reverend Peters
and tried not to cry
when they said
the Dog’s Prayer.

Bonfire Number Three
In the Dark -

mother never told me much
about sex.
she was always
too embarrassed to really
explain it.
“read this,” she'd say,
backing out the bedroom door
almost as quickly as she

came in.
too many years passed before
i éver read anything, and
old moth balls do not protect
new blankets.

Quiltlike

I tonight

froot loops and wine,
while you

asking sublime,

may I sprawl
quiltlike

on your soul

all the night,
remembering this
knowing why

love awakens

Icry,

and the soggy loops
and luke warm wine
answer your body
with mine.
