Auditorium

TEN KEYS PRESENTED

“O Davidson” Played in Im-
pressive Setting

On Friday, March 20, the
Davidson College Symphonic
Band under the direction of
James Christian Pfohl present-
ed a concert at Davidson, and
the crowd filling the auditor-
ium gave evidence of their ap
preciation of the fine playing
by their enthusiasm. Every
player in’ the band deserves
credit, and Mr. Piohl especially
for the fine work that he has
done in working with the or-
chestra until it obtained per-
feet harmony.

The first portion of the concert
Was given over to the playing of
dificult, serious, and beautiful num
bers, while those after intermission
Were lighter, some being rather
humorous. The quartet composed
of Paul Hudson, first tenor; John
Allen, second tenor; Charles Ram-
seur, baritone; and Donald Piohl,
bass, rendered three pieces during
intermission, the last being as an
encore,

The program is as follows:
“Wake, Awake! For Night Is Fly-
ing”’—by Bach
The Bach harmonization of this
beautiful chorale is perhaps the best
known of the many settings given

Nicholai’s original tune.

Overture “Ariane’—Louis Boyer

\riane, so the story goes, was the
sixth wife of Gilles de ta Val, bet-

ter known as “Bluebird,” a sinister,

medieval character. It was Ariane
who tricked “Bluebird” in releasing
his five former wives, and who
brought destruction upon him

“Three Kings’—Walter Smith

Walter Smith is one of the bet
ter known band conductors in
America today, and this number
Was originally played by him and
his two sons on cornets. Messrs
Helms, FE. Parker, and Tillotson
played. this number ow baritone

horns, and this was one of the high-

lights of. the concert

Introduction to Act III,

“Lohengrin”——Wagner
An “introduction,” like an over
ture, is intended to prepare for
something that is to follow. The
introduction to the third act of
“Lohengrin” representS the happy
excitement of those engaged in

preparations for the wedding of
Lohengrin and Elsa, which occurs
at the opening of Act UL. As the
excitement — finally — subside the
Warning is given that the bridal
procession —is+ approaching Then
follows the famous Bridal Chorus
INTERMISSION
Memories of Stephen Foster—
Lucien Caillet
This arrangement is a musical and
artistic accomplishment of outstand
ing merit, and Mr. Caillet has given
the syinphonic band a wonderful
piece of work

‘ComeClean’Campaign

Launched By YMCA

Wade Boggs is in charge of the
annual “Come Clean” campaign now
being carried on among the Char-
lotte grammer’ school and high
school boys by the Davidson Y. M.
C, A. in“ednjunction with the Civic
tar Club of Charlotte.

It is a program of higher living
Which is being brought to the boys
through speeches at school and
group meetings, and by pledges,

A delegation consisting of repre-
sentatives of all four ‘classes left
the hill Tuesday morning at. six
thirty A. M., to make speeches at
the high and grammer schools of
Charlotte

After exhorting the boys to clean-
er Christian living, they distributed
cards on which were pledges em-
bodying the main principles of the
program. Boys who cared to join
in the campaign were urged to sign
these agreements and /to keep the
pledges

This campaign is in) line with

others which have been conducted

in va cities throughout the
country, and ‘%arries forward one
of the most important aims of the
Davidson Y. M. C. A.: namely, to
be of service to those who are not
otherwise brought under such in-
fluences It is reported that the
work in Charlotte has met with an
enthusiastic reception from thy boys
concerned, and tentative plans are
to carry it further. This is a some-
what different field from that regu-
larly entered by Y. M. C. A. depu-
tations, and has aroused consider-
able interest onythe part of those
engaged in it.

Richards Uses
Faith For His

Topic Sunday

Son of Davidson Professor

Warns Against Tricks
Of Thought

Need for Wis

loth” was the subject of Dr. James

“The Christian's

McDowell Richards’ sermon at ves
vers Jast Sunday night.

Dr, Richards took as the seripture
Matthew 10:5-17, and from — this
ased the sixteenth verse as his text

As this verse of scripture speaks
f being wise as serpents, Dr. Rich
tds pointed out that The Master
was the best example of that type
of wisdom, and then showed how
He rebutted all of those who tried
to trick Him. He then told of the
tricks of modern thought which
tend to lead ous from Christian
truth.

Vhe first of these he said is the
false alternative. This is the trick
used by those who say that you
must have cither faith or reason, He
pointed out how man must have
faith in all lines of endeavor, and
then showed that man needs faith
and reason,

Dr. Richards said that the second
trick that was used was the delusion
of the explanation, He said that men
point out that if we can not ex
plain something iteis no longer nat-
ural He showed how we accept
many things around us that we can't
explain, but that they seem = very
natural

Nhe third trick that Dr. Richards
referred to was speaking of reli
gion with an epithet that is some
what derisive These usually have
no relation to religion, it was shown

Ihe last trick which wa dis
cussed by Dr. Richards was that of

supposing that the majority of men

must be right It was proven by
several noted examples from hi
tory that the majority is often

Wrong
