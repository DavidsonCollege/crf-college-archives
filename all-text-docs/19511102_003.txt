You probably
thought when you read
the score of the game
last week, ‘‘Oh. well,
the Cats come through
again” in the usual sar-
castic manner. But if
} you had been there and
seen that game, you
wouldn't be so critical
and skeptical of the
team. I have never seen
a bunch play such in-
spired ball and so hard
in my life.

There was some-
thing in the warm Vir-
ginia air. maybe the ex-
excitement and bustle of Homecoming festivities or just the feeling
that the team was nearly back to preseason condition, but the
Cats took the field with a spirit and determination that was in-
Spiring. The first few minutes found the Red and Black in the
General's command post, but not quite in headquarters.

DAVIS WARMS UP TOE
During the first half, Gene Davis, the extra-point specialist,
was continuously warming up in preparation for the what-
appeared-to-be inevitable TD. This was just an indication of the
game that the boys played in the first half.

By DICK LILES

The Cats were getting the breaks. true. but they
were playing for them. The tackling and blocking was
greatly improved and the plays were run to perfection.
Everything went well until the “Big Blue's’ ten-yard
marker was reached. The line smashes carried for at
least five yards every time and the pitchouts around
the ends met unusual success. Jimmy Thacker. Ham
Wade. and Henry Brown. who incidentally played his
first full game at offense in addition to his regular
duties as backer-up ran the ball well and made several
sizeable gains. It was Jack Ruth, however. that made
the difference over last week. Oné of the Richmond
sports writers during the W.A%6L. fray satd that he was
seeing an entirely different team from the one that
played Richmond the week before. and that he certainly
was glad that Ruth failed to see action that day.

“FAT-JACK” SHINES ON DEFENSE

Big Jerry Kiser turned in perhaps his best performance of
the season on the defensive platoon. Jerry was tackling viciously
and making tackles all over the field. The Shelby Senior has
been playing outstanding ball all year as the records showing
Davidson as a defensive leader will prove. The 34 points which
the Generals scored on the locals can be accounted for by the
simple reason that they were supposed to be about that much
better than the Presbyterians. and that they outmanned the Cats
so badly and wore out our injury-riddled defenses after the
third quarter injury-fest.

If you will think back. you will remember that
this ts the first game that the Cats have failed to score
in. and the first half of the game would remind one
of the Presbyterian fiasco. The boys tried with all they
had, but just didn’t have the punch to score or get that
extra yard for a first.

I think by their determination and the fight they have
shown, that the team should be given another chance. It seems,
as another columnist in The Davidsonian put it, that ‘‘a semi-
permanent sort of inferiority complex has settled over the cam-
pus.” The good work of the cheerleaders and the student body
in. the pre-PC pep rally seems to have been doomed to obscurity.
Let's try to get up that spirit again before our last home stand
and beat State College.

Jt can be done and is not at all impossible. Everyone should
know what it will take and should start getting behind the
team for a better game. Sheer determination and fight is the
answer. Alex Webster is no problem!

SPORTS SLANTS FROM THE PAST

In 1913 on this weekend, Notre Dame defeated the Cadets
of Army by 35-13. It was the first win in 34 games for the
lrish and it was the passing of Knute Rockne and Guss Dorais
that completely routed the Army eleven.

The most amazing punt in football history was booted
in 1946 in a game between Rice Institute and Tulane. Huey
Keeney of Rice punted the oval 105 phenomenal yards includ-
ing the roll.

V.M.I. Host To Cats Tomorrow

} Unsung Winders Gather Steam

Thacker Remains
On Injured List

DICK ROPER

Still alive but not kicking so much any longer, the Wildcats
make the long trip up,to Lexington, Va.. again tomorrow to
meet the Keydets of VMI in their seventh game of. the season.

And they’re still crippled, in some | nnn

places badly.

Worst blow to the Cat back-
field since Jack Ruth's mishap
was the wrenched knee Fresh-
man scatback Jim Thacker suf-
fered in the wild third quarter
againet Washington and Lec
last Saturday. Thacker has been
working out in sweat clothes
the whole week during practice,
and will probably see little if
any service against VMI.

The Keydets are rated three to
four touchdowns over Coach
Crowell Little’s team, but if the
Cats play the brand of ball for sixty
thinutes that they played for. thirty
last week against W&h., they ll
vive the Keydets some shaky ma-
ments,

Two réasons why the Cats held
George Harclay’s Generals to a
scoreless tie during: the first half
last Saturday come from that coach
himself:

“Jerry Kiser is one of the
finest defensive guards we've
played against this season.
Time after time he broke
through our line and broke up
our plays. He was also out-
standing in rushing passers.”

“Jin Thacker, until he was hurt,
gave our defense constant trouble.

A fine running. back, he was a
threat at all times.”
Kiser, who séems to improve

every pame, will be in- there to-
morrow. Thacker can’t be counted
on for another week or two.

A factor which bodes no good
for the Cats tomorrow is that
VMI and Washington and Lee
are bitter rivals, and the Key-
dets will undoubtedly be pour-
ing it on as hard as they can
in order to top the Generals
score.

But sometimes a crippled cat,
when he gets mad enough, can
whip an opponent against whom he
ordinarily wouldn't have a chance.
Coach Crowell Little hopes that
will be the case tomorrow.

WILDCAT: OF

By BOB HAZARD
e

“Good cross-country men dort
know what the word ‘quit’ means.”
These words are posted on the
wall in the dressing room of the
cross country team. Maybe they

sound a bit trite to some of our],

readers, but to Tom Stockton, our
Wildcat of the Week, they have
meant a lot. Sure, its easy to slow
down or drop out of the race when
you're ‘way behind and a couple
of more sniles to go, but this is
never the case for the Number One
man of the Wildcat harriers, for
he is seldom behind and he never
quits,

For this year’s record, in the
last three meets he has broken
two records and _ probably
would have toppled the third
had he not slowed down to let
teammates Bill Lee and Bill
Shipley finish in a three-way
tie with him at W. & L. In the
meet with the University of
North Carolina. Tom cased
across the tine in the record
time for the Davidson course
——21:15. This broke the record
of N. C, States Garrison and
Shockley, which stood at
2:16.21,

The fohowing week, the Wins-
ton-Salem Senior led the way for
vis mates in their rout of the Uni-
e1s..y of Richmond thinclads, with
so new record uf 23:13.5 for the
Richmond layout, The old record
stood at 23:47. last week, the Cats
went out against Washington an]
Lee's deep breathers, and againtthe
lean captain of the locals showed
his fleet heels, although he stopped

In V. MI Meet

By BILL MORRIS

“Lightnin’ " Bill Lee has eume
intto his own.

This diminbitive cross-country
ramner came to Davidsen from
Warrington, Flerida, faar years ayo
with just enough running fori
needed to get out of the way of a
freight. train, Put Bill was a bey
with guts, se he went ont for and
played sonic freshman football, His
suphomoure year he went out for
Cross-country, thaugh sill lacking
a wood deal of polished form, and
has been one. of the stalwart Ivar-
riers ever since.

Last week he tied for first
place with Tom Stockton and
Bill Shipley inthe meet with
Washington and Lee in Lex-
ington, Va. His years of drudg-
ery and back-breaking train-
ing are paying dividends.

Lee's a two-mile runner on the

track squad in’ the spring, win-
ning that race in meets with Wof-
ford “and Clemson last year. He
has-a Jetter in both frack and cross
country.

Bil?s a yery likeable cuss, and
so good natured that une can't help

“very easy to work with.”

Davidson's _ harriers run
against a pretty good V.M.I.
aggregation, again in Lexing-
ton, tomorrow, and you can
bet that Bill Lee will finish
in there with the best of them.

The = state cross-country meet
will be held in Raleigh on the

be awarded the winning team and

individual trophies will be given

Pi Kapps Lower Kappa Sigs
Keep Tie-Lead With K. A's

The end ‘of pnother week of in-
tramural football lias come, and
once again we find two teams tied
for the league lead, The two reams
now tied are the: KA‘’s and the Pi
Kapps. It was a matter of touch
and go as the Ii Kapps edged the
Kappa Sips 7-6 to remain tied for
first place and to climinate the
Kappa Sigs fronv last week's three-
way tie, As can be imagined by
the score it was one of the closest
games yet played, and it was truly
the team that tock advantage of
the breaks that came out on: top.

The KA's, however. had a
much easier week than the Pi
Kapps, because they were able
to win their game with the
Campus Club by a 56-0 score,
the highest total of the season.

Also for the second place position
we find two more-teams all tied
up; they are the Kappa Sigs and
Sigma Chis. The Sigma Chis
moved up, to their second place
position ‘by virtue of their victory
over the Betas on Monday. While

Tthe Kappa Sigs moved down to

their second place spot. because. of
a defeat by the Pi Kapps.

With only about three games re-
maining for most of the teams it
Jooks like the four top teams will
be playing their hearts out to try
to eliminate the other three and
come out on top. With so few
games left-it looks like ope of these
far teams, or the SIE's, with a
5-2 record, will-come out victorions.
