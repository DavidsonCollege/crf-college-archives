BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL

But black students are often lonely because so few are at Davidson.

Faculty Mixing Is Stalled

By ROBERT PYEATT
Assoclate Editor

The prospects for getting
any black faculty members
at. Davidson in the near fu
ture are dim.

This was the net result of
comments by President Sam-
vei R. Spencer: Jr. outlining
the difficulties in hiring Ne-
gro professors at a press con
ference Tuesday.

Although Spencer sald
that he personally is desir-
ous of having Negro facul-
ty members here, he listed
three major difficulties:

The pool of qualified
black candidates for faculty
positions is éxtremely small.

—Some black candidates
want to go to black institu
tions: they feel a responsibil-
sity to return to these col-
leges.

—The difficulties black in
sututions have in keeping fac-
culty because they aré much
in demand by white. institu:
tions trying to integrate their
faculties and set up black
studies programs. Many
southern Negro colleges have
Jost their best professors re-
cently.

Spencer said that only
one or two faculty positions
are currently open for next
year and he thought it
would be very difficult to
get Negroes to fill them.

However, he said that a
black Army officer has been
appointed to the ROTC De-
partment for next year.

In response to a question
about whether he had direct-
ed any department chairmen
to seek actively Negro fac-
ulty, Spencer said that fac-
ulty selection is basicly done
by a three-man committee in-
cluding the department chair-
man, Dean of Faculty Fron-
tis Johnston and himself. He
said they are interested in
getting biack faculty.

Ssthough Spencer has an-
nounced a policy of inte-
grating the clerical staff, no
Negroes have been hired.
Two clerical positions have
been filled by white people
since fast fall. Spencer
sald that the college had
been unable to find any Ne-
gro applicants for the Jobs.

One difficulty in_ bringing
Negro faculty members to
Davidson is the problem of
community acceptance.

One Davidson resident who
owns real estate in the town
2nd occasionally selts lots to
faculty members for home

building. does. so on the-con-
ditton that. ‘they will not sell
the land to a Negro.

Conditions like this would,

obviously, make it diffi-

cult for a Negro professor
in Davidson.

'The college would. have
Fesponsibility for providing
good housing and making the
person fee] welcome.”’ Spen-
cer commented on the prob-
lem.

Dr. E. F. Patterson. mem-
ber of the Extra Campus
Responsibilities Commission.
said that there would be an
initial. period of shock and
adjustment in the Davidson
community and that: a black

faculty member ‘probably
wouldn't be very happy
here.”

_He urged integrating the
faculty with two or three
black professors af once
and integration of the cler-

ical staff at the same time.

Spencer said that while it
would probably be desirable
to integrate the faculty ini-
tially with more than one
black professor, the small
number of openings for pro-
fessors of any given year
and the small number of Ne-
gro candidates for faculty
positions would probably pre-
vent this.

Patterson has served on a
committee of the local chap-
ter of the American Associa
tion of University Professors
to set up a faculty exchange
with black colleges in this
area. ,

Under the plan the AAUP
has formulated, Davidson
professors would teach
courses at nearby ‘Negro
colleges like Johnson C.
Smith and Barber-Scotia
while being paid by David-
son.

Managing Editor

Davidson's dabbling af
fair with black education
has a short and frustrating
history.

It all began with a direc-
tive from the Presbyterian
Board'of World Missions back
in 1961 which asked the col-
lege’s help in the Board’s
African Education program.
Before that time, in practice
if not in theory, Davidson ad
missions was, like the rest of
the South. ‘for whites only."

Dr. Grier Martin. then
president of the college. and

This would allow faculty
at those institutions to take
leaves of absence to work
on advanced degrees and
thus upgrade the quality of
education at these colleges.
The Extra Campus Respon-

sibilities Commission has
presented this plant to the
Johnson C, Smith adminis-
tration. and they responded
favorably to it. Patterson
said.

This plan, or a similar one,
will probably be one of the
recommendations of the com:
mission.

One method of integrating
thé faculty would be to hire
black graduate students for
one or two-year appoint-
ments, the way the college
currentiy makes short-term
appointments. .

This might be easier than
attempting to get a Negro

Commission To Answer:
Which Blacks To Bring?

With both college and stu-
dents at least nominally com-
mitted to the goal of inte-
grating Davidson from top to
bottom. and the = student
body informed of the need
and desirability of such 4
move, it remains to those
charged with doing some-
thing about it to untagle the
complexities involved.

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer Jr.,
in his inaugural speech as
president of the college, set
up a Commission on Extra-

The Official Line

From the text of President
Spencer’s inauguration ad-
Gress:

“But an educational insti-
tution today cannot afford
the luxuries of sentimentality
and chauvinism. It cannot
wistfully choose preoccupa-
tion with a known and some-
what idealized past over the
hard realities of an unknown
future.

“Its posture must be ag-
gressive rather than defen-
sive. Though i must be ver-
satile enough to provide the
setting for serious and un-
disturbed study, it cannot
use its hallowed walls to iso-
late itself in sterile immun-
ity from the society of which
it is a part.”

“Colleges like Davidson are
realizing, belatedly, that they
have responsibilities which
extend into the concentric
communities of which they
are a part.”

‘But hindsight makes clear
that Southern colleges and
universities have been incred-
ibly myopie in viewing the
specific needs of a region

plagued for a century by
problems of racial discrimi-
nation, economic deprivation,
and cultural mainutrition.

“Suddenly, prodded awake
by the goading insistence of
a people who will wait no
longer, we see that our own
spiritual and material health
is inevitably bound up pith
theirs.” °

“What the Commission on
Extra-campus _Responsibili-
ties can help us do. I be-
Heve, is to define our respon-
sibilities and suggest how
we, as one small college, can
best contribute to our region-
al boot-strap operation with-
out losing effectiveness in a
dissipation or diffusion of our
energies.”

“I might add parenthet-
icaly that one of the ways
‘in which we can demonstra-
te that we mean what we
say about non-discrimination
is to open the doors of op-
portunity to persons of other
races at the faculty, staff,
and office-clerical levels. This
I intend to do as soon as we
can find qualified candidates
who are interested.”

Campus_ Responsibilities
(ECR) to define Davidson's
responsibilities. and suggest
ways to begin the ‘‘boot-
strap operation’ of harmon-
izing its concerns to those of
blacks in this area.

One of the commission's
concerns is finding on-cam
pus methods of making the
college more attractive to
minority students.

This is only part of that
commission’s work, and to
some it may’ seem easy
enough to study. but the ques.
tions are actually very com.
plex in nature.

One of the most sensitive
issues is what type of black
students should Davidson try
to attract. Some feel that
Davidson should seek to as
similate the middle class Ne-
gro. Others feel that Negroes
from a disadvantaged back.
ground have more to add—
and more to gain—from Da-
vidson.

The arguments in favor of
admitting middle class blacks
parallel those for admitting
middle class whites. And, if
competitive admissions stand-
ards remain, these are about
the only students who have
a chance of getting into Da-
vidson.

As H. Edmund White, ad-
missions director, pointed out
in a DAVIDSONIAN inter.
view, the mere fact that an
institution like Davidson
takes students from the top
10 per cent of their high
school classes .confers some
automatic similarities in the
resulting student body.

But the issue, as it must
be faced by members of the

ECR, is more complicated.

James Parks. a student
member of the ECR, outlined
Some of the consequences
that having middle class
blacks would bring.

Middle class blacks are,
Parks said, more emotional-
ly secure, and they know
what the good things in life
are, These factors help them
to make a speedier adapta-
tion to the Davidson environ-
ment.

But. Parks continued, they
are more “bitter at social in-
equities’ and are ‘more like-
ly to be more rambunctious
in the end.”

This is because they are
less easily intimidated, and
can see through the argu-
ments which support “the
system.”’ They are more ex-
perienced in the types of ac-
tivities on whch the social
and economic society de-
pends (finances, organiza-
tions, etc.).

“And,” said Parks, ‘‘each
one has his own personal
hang-up like every other
middle class kid."

Speaking as a black stu-
dent at Davidson, Parks
said he felt that large insti-
tutional changes would have
to be made in order to make
Davidson more attractive to
minority students.

Money spent on beefed up
recruiting efforts may not
bring the desired results, he
sald, unless black high school
students can look to a Da-
vidson with black faculty
members, better relations
with black colleges in the
area, and no prohibition
against scholarship students
owning cars.

the Board of Trustees accept-
ed the Board of World Mis-
sions’ challenge. and two Af-
rican students were admitted
in 1962 and 1963.

In 1964 the first American
Negro students were admit-
ted to Davidson. Since that
time, 10 Negroes have been
admitted and enrolled, and
three have dropped out be-
fore graduation.

H. Edmunds White, cur-
rent director of admissions,
has worked in the admis-
sions offce for 14 years.

White says there have nev-
er been more. than eight ap-
plications from Negroes un-
til this year.

So.” he says, ‘it has work-

ed out—not that there was a-

quota or anything—that we
have accepted two or three
blacks every year.”

As director of admissions,
White has been responsible
for recruiting black students.
But his efforts have met with
continual frustration.

Six years ago White be-
gan contacting students
through the National Schol-
arship Service and Fund
for Negro Students (NSS-
FNS). Half of the black
students presently enrolled
were originally contacted
through this association.
‘We take the initiative once

we we find out” about Negro
students who might come to
Davidson,"' White reported.

Another national scholar.
ship provides a source
of Negro applicants. The Na-
tional Achievement Scholars
program of the National Mer-
it Scholastic Corporation pro-
vides for competition among.
black -students in a program
of testing similar to the fa-
miliar NMSQT program.

Last year Davidson con-
facted the 80 finalists of
NAS awards, but this year
it wrote to all 250 semi-
finalists. Students Joe Mur-
phy and Larry Slade fol-
towed up on official con-
facts with this group of
blacks, but their effo-ts
have met with little initial
success.

Although White acceded
that every application from a
black students ‘‘gets an es-
pecially careful look.’ he
made it clear that no black

student gets preferential .

treatment from the admis-
sions committee because he
is black.

However, White added
that for all students ‘we
consider any student’s ap-
plication in light of all that
we can find out about him,”
his family, social and ed-
ucational backgrounds.

‘We are interested in hav-
ing additional black students
on this campus, well, one
reason being for the benefit
of the black students already
on campus.”

White said he realized that
it was “hard to change pat-
terns of any kind: where stu-
dents apply, whether they
take achievement tests,
where they decide to go
But we simply have to con-
tinue efforts and hope to get
a representative number (of
blacks) in the future.”

Sald White: “We had
some increase (in applica-
tlons) this year because of
major efforts of a few stu-
dents and some effort by
many other students. We
were-disappointed that their

efforts haven't resulted in

a larger number this year.”

The figures for this year's
incoming freshman class do
not reflect any special con-
sideration of black appli-
cants A total of 33 applica-
tions were received from
blacks, but out of these only
16 or 17 were ‘‘complete,”
that is. with all test scores
and recommendations includ-
ed.

Out of these applications
six blacks were accepted in
the first round of acceptanc-
es, and two have already
been earmarked for accept-
ance in the second round.
which will be announced
April 15.

The Presidential Commis-

said he feels that Davidson's
failure to attract black stu-
dents is due to the ‘outdat-
ed idea’ that Davidson can
draw students without active-
ly seeking them.

At present. Davidson has no
program for recruiting indi-
vidual students — white or
black — apart from athletic
recruiting. Present efforts are
exhausted by contact with
national scholarship organi-
zations and participation in
high school ‘‘College Days.“

“They aren’t actively re-
crulting now,’ Parks said,
“but they should be.

“I don’t question their mo-
tive, but I just say that they
are not doing enough.”

The unfortunate, and ap-
parently unintentional. result
of Davidson's “non-recruit-
ing’' is that it leads black
high school counselors to dis-
trust Davidson.

Joe Champion, the guld-
ance counselor at predom-

inantly black West Char-
lotte High, has been dis-
turbed by the treatment of
some of his Davidson ap-
plicants.

+. Davidson Negroes Have Endured
* Frustrating Fight For Admission

Parks said that Champion
has had applicants accepted
at Ivy League schools. but
some of those he felt were
qualified to be accepted by
Davidson were not accepted.

Champion also complained
about lack of personal re-
cruiting. especially since ca-
pable black students are
sought after by many North-
ern schools.

Both White and Parks
concurred that the job of
actively recruiting black
students is left almost en-
firely to Individual stu-
dents.

But Parks said they work
as free lancers, without of-
ficial recognition or much
practical assistance from the
admissions office.

The problems of admit-
ting black students are
complex and dependent
upon factors beyond the
power of elther the col-
lege or individuals of con-
trol.

An examination of the his-
tory of black recruiting
shows that this art is stil! in
its infancy, at least. at Da-
vidson. .

Of course, no one deuies
that Davidson is sincere in
its commitment to fulfill its
duty to black students and
white.

It's just that progress is
slow — and frustrating.

But Spencer's Black History course is nevertheless “lily white.”

Spencer’s Class Stresses
Negro History’s Relevance

By CHUCK GREEN
and PAUL SCHNEIDER
Steff Writers

A “good beginning’ best
characterizes President Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr.'s Free
University course. ‘The Ne-
gro and American Society,
1865-1940,"" said junior Har-
rell Rentz.

A nomhistory major, Rentz
said he did not know much
about American history, es-
pecially of the post-Civil War
period. In praising the course,
Rentz said, “It is beneficial
to me and it is a good way
to get a background of the
Negro situation which is one
of the most explosive issues
of the time.”

Black Studies Get Boost

By NORWOOD POLAND
Staff Writer

Interest in black culture at
Davidson has received new
impetus from an unexpected
quarter with the organization
of a seminar on 20th Cen-
tury Africa by the pledge
class of Kappa Alpha frater-
nity.

Wanting to contribute
“something of benefit to
riore people than just the
fraternity membership,” the
KA pledges have initiated a
seven-week course on mod-
ern Africa in the spirit of the
Free University, KA pledge
Bobby Allen said.

Mr. Noyce Dube, a native
of Africa and a professor at
Johnson C. Smith University
in Charlotte, will lecture and
lead a discussion each Thurs-
day evening beginnng April
3. Dube has studied in Rho-
desta, England and the Unit-

ed States.

KA pledges Tom Robert-
son and Lawrence Wilkinson
first suggested the idea of a
black culture course as a
pledge project, and the pro-
posal has met with enthusi-
astic approval by the rest of
the class, according to pledge
Frank Dana. The KA broth-
ers have also reacted favor-
ably to the project, Dana
said.

The active members of the
fraternity have, in fact, of-
fered to contribute matching
funds raised by tne pledges
for the course. Between $250
and $300 will be needed, Al-
len said, and most of this
has already been raised.

While the primary motiva-
tion for organizing the 20th
Century Africa course was
service-oriented, Allen ad-
mitted that there would be
secondary benefit to the fra-

Rentz is one of several stu-
dents, faculty and wives, and
Queens girls taking the
course which was begun in
the second session of the
Free University. (There are
no black students in the
course).

According to Spencer, the
course offers an interpreta-
tion of post-Civil War race
relations in the United States,
“an interpretation of why we
failed.”

He feels that in order to
understand what is now hap-
pening the past must be an-
alyzed, and that is his task.

Spencer began the. course
by citing the parallel between
the Civil Rights Acts of 1865

ternity by correcting the im-
age KAs have in the South.”
Dana agreed, saying, “We
want to show that KA’s are
not ‘southern fried,’ and that
we can contribute to the
commuhity in an open and
constructive way.’

No moves have yet been
made to include local blacks
in the course, or to involve
black students from Davidson
and Johnson C. Smith in the
discussions, however.

Allen said that these peo-
ple are welcome to attend
the sessions, but that time
had not permitted active so-
licitation of these people as
participants.

Some 40 people have sign-
ed up for the seminar so far,
and there is still room for
more interested participants.
The 17 KA pledges and a
number of brothers are plan-
ning to attend es well, Allen
said.

and 1964. Many of the pas-
sages are quite similar, he
said, and the basic question
is why after 90 years of
the first act, a second one
was needed.

Spencer has covered sev-
eral topics up to this week.
He has spoken of the Civil
War as a watershed in Amer-
ican history, politically, so-
cially and constitutionally.

He has talked of the re-
sponse of the white North, ‘‘a
great withdrawal” in which
the North wanted to forget
the Negro, and the response
of the white South, “the tri-
umph of Jim Crow. the ce-
menting of segregation.”

He has recently taken up
the response of the Negro:
the accommodation of B. T.
Washington and the efforts of
W.E.B. DuBois to reform the
system.

In subsequent _lectures
Spencer will speak of Marcus
Garvey’s wish to withdraw
from the ‘system and the ef-
forts of the Communist Par-
ty to overthrow it. His con-
cluding lecture will tie up all
of his previous points and
present his views on the trend
of the present.

Rentz stated that Spen-
cer “usually bursts a few
bubbles; he knocks the wind
out of standard southern de-
fenses for the Negro situa-
tion as it exists.”

Mrs. Richard Cole, wife of
a Davidson English profes-
sor, is taking the course be.
cause she feels it is a lively
subject and felt Spencer
was an authority on the sub-
ject.

Dr. Francis Ghigo, a Da-
vidson French Professor, said
he was “ignorant” about Ne.
gro history, and he wanted
to hear a historian's Perapec-
tive. He, too, felt that he had
been “enlightened.”
