ALUMNI NOTES

Major W. G. Summerville, ex-'16,
will be on the Hill Thursday and Friday
of this week. Major Summerville was
one of the most popular men in college
during his four years here and was
president of the Y. M. C. A. during his
last year. He left Davidson during his
senior year and accepted an important
banking position, but leaving this posi-
tion soon, he entered Union ‘Vheologi-
cal Seminary at Richmond, Virginia.
Upon America’s entrance into the war,
he answered the call of his country and
left the seminary. After his discharge,
Major Summerville re-entered the sem-
inary and is now in his second year
there.

While here he will be glad to dis-
cuss any matters with ministerial stu-
dents or any others interested.

An effort will be made to have Ma-
jor Summerville address the ministerial
band,

A few days ago the University of
South Carolina dedicated twenty-eight
trees to the memory of their twenty-
eight alumni who died in the service of
their country. One of these trees was
dedicated to the memory of one who as
well as being an alumnus of that insti-
tution is an alumnus of Davidson. This
was James McCants Douglas, ‘10, of
Winnsboro, S$. C. After graduating
from Davidson, Mr. Douglas entered the
University of South Carolina, from
which he received the degree of LL.B.
in 1913. Upon America’s entrance into

jstrength needed for war

the war, he immediately volunteered and
entered the first officers’ training camp
at Oglethorpe, Ga. He received his
commission as second lieutenant on Au-
gust 15, 1917. He died at Fort Bliss
on October 12, 1918.

Corps. He participated in the battle of

WORLD FORUM HOLDS LAST
MEETING OF YEAR.

The last World Forum meeting of
the year was held last Thursday even-
ing. The theme discussed was “The
Mobilization of Christian Forces,” and
in a sense it was an appropriate study
for the last meeting.

The first line of thought brought out
was that the war has revealed the possi-
bilities of thorough mobilization. Ger-
many, at the beginning of the war,
stood easily first in completeness of prep-
aration. The United States’ great ge-
nius for organization found its whole
preparation
and mobilization. “These hasty and
thorough mobilizations stand as a shin-
ing example to us of what the Church
can and should do. It should mobilize
its intelligence, leadership, man power,
and material resources, ;

The second line of discussion was that
the world campaign of the Church de-
serves the full mobilization of Christian
strength. The dimensions of the under-
taking and its difficulties are very great,
the need of the undertaking is urgent,
the aim of the exploit is worthy, and it
will be a great reward to those helping
and honor to God. Nevertheless, the
Church can and is mobilizing its forces.

L. bk. McALISTER NEW STU-
DENT BODY PRESIDENT.

The student body held its annual elec-
tion Monday morning. After several
votes the supporters of Lacy McAllister
won out. Currie and Schenck were se-
lected from the rising Junior Class as
the coming vice presidents and James
Sprunt was elected secretary and treas-
urer for the year 1919-1920.

Get Behind the.
Victory Loan

Let’s Make the Thing Go. It’s a Duty
and Privilege.

Much effort is being put forth in or-
der that the great Victory Loan might
travel the same road of success that the
Liberty Loans traveled.

While the war was going on, we, the
people of the United States, had to go
right down into our pockets and lend
our money to our government. As a
result of our getting behind our Army
and Navy in this manner, the war has
been brought to a close and wwe are
again about to enter upon an era of
peace and happiness. “The task of fight-
ing has been accomplished. Now there
is just as great a one before us—that of
reconstruction,

This work cannot be — successfully
done unless the people stand behind the
government. And to stand behind the
government means something more than
merely being there in mind and spirit.
[t means putting our money as well as
our hearts into it.

‘This task is not for only a few, but
it is for every person and organization.
The R. O. ‘T. C. has entered into the
fight to do its part, One of the pri-
mary objects of the R. O. T. C. is the
inculcation and fostering of patriotism.
This is one way it is going to show its
patriotism.

So let it be plainly understood that in
subscribing to the Victory Loan@ind giv-
ing the credit of your loan to the R. O.
T. C. does not effect in any way the
sales in the towns and cities. This cam-
paign will not interfere with but is to
assist in the subscription of local quotas.

It is up te every man, woman and
child to do his part.

Remember that on the patriotic gen-
crosity of the American public and_ its
grateful appreciation of our victorious
military and naval efforts, depends the
success of this, the final Victory Loan.

Up to date the Davidson College R.
O. T. C. Unit has credit for $3,100.00
of bonds.

What will you do? Finish the job?

Reproduced from a prose contest in
which Honoria Squiggers, the — child

neck :
“Two hearts that yearn
For love's sweet prison
Where his is her'n
And her'n is his‘n.”
