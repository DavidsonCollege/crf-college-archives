Homosexuality And-Luke

Skywalker: Confusion Rains

As I ate lur h the other day
with a group © riends who are
notoriously energetic conversa-
tionalists, I was somewhat dis-
mayed at thé’ zrim silence: that
seemed likely 1 Jominate what a
week before would have been a
very pleasant dining experience.

Rather than succumb. to the
wartime urge to eat meals in si-
lence and avoid meeting anyone’s
gaze, though, I decided to strike a
blow for the survival of the Vail
Commons Dinner Conversation: 1
told those silent, brooding friends
of my plans for Spring Break.

Actually, one of the less silent
ones asked what my plans were,
butsince I’m.telling the story I will
take credit for |
liveliness of the discussion that
followed.

If anybody else that was there
wants some recognition they can
write their own column - I’m not
running a Charity benefit. But I
must continue. — %

Allin hearing range were quite
impressed by my enviable plans
for“les vacances de printemps,” as
they say in French Guiana. For
you see, I am ona mission from
God. Iam making a pilgrimage to
the most sacred city. of Chicago,
where my Grandfather's former
neighbor’s son will give mea tour
of his place of business.

Ah, now, dear reader, your
curiosity has been sparked! You
burn inside, wanting to know what

this business might be ... but burn
no more. This relative of a friend
of a relative of mine runs a mail
order prophylactic, lingerie,
scented oil and aphrodisiac com-
pany. :

Now before you even pick up
the phone to call and:ask my per-
mission to come along, remember
two things: 1) you may not, and 2)
this is only an introduction to what
I shall call the essence of the col-
umn, which is actually more stimu

Now we didn’t really make
any headway in solving the myriad
problems surrounding that delicate
issue (although I was able to shock
most of the women by telling them
about 7th-grade boys’ preference
for the section of the dirty maga-
zine that has two women in the
picture instead of just one). We
did, however, raise some interest-
ing questions, and after further
reflection I have come up with
some more.

Why didn't Luke join the Dark Side? Why
are congressmen so stupid and political
analysts so smart? Why do people kill each

other?

tour could ever be. Intellectually,
that is.

Well, as conversations often
do, this one (we were having a
dinner.conversation, remember?)
changed course a numberof times,
making its way from brief talk

about mail order companies to a.

longerdiscussion of... you guessed
it: homosexuality. WHOA.....easy
there, fella. I realize you haven’t
heard that word on this campus for
awhile, much less seen it'in print,
but try to bear with me here.

As I mentioned before, my
friends were wearing their un-
happy-about-the-war hats, and no
average topic was going to restore
the flow of blood to their above-
average brains.

So at last, thanks to my cata-

. lytic presence, discussion began in

earnest. Since neither of the um-
brella twins from the land Beyond
Birkenstock were around, wecould
actually participate in an intelli-
gent exchange of ideas. without
being concerned about a rash of
homophobic eye-plucking.

If. the last sentence escaped
you reader, forgive me. I mean

thatthe people present ranged from

moderates (much like myself) to
representatives of what you might

“term the political left -- a crowd

sure to have some well thought-
outopinions on the issue of (here it
comes again) homosexuality.

For instance, why are people
at Davidson leery about saying the
word ho.... homo... well, I’ve al-
ready used it twice. Idon’thave to
prove anything.

And whatever happened to the
GSG? Were their eyes plucked
out? Why does the person at the
table who claims to have homo-
sexual friends get stares of awe
and disbelief? Why do some up-
tight people become upset when
people view homosexuality froma
purely sexual standpoint?

What makes a homosexual re-
lationship different from any same-
sex friendship, if it isn’t the sex?
And if that’s what differentiates

- the two, then is the sex the essence

of homosexuality?

Can an individual truly secure
in his own idealogies really be so
solicitous of his neighbor’s life
enough to care whether or not that
neighbor is homosexual? Why
didn’t Luke join the Dark Side?
Why are congressmen so stupid
and political analysts so smart?
Why do people kill each other?

I guess it was pointless to try to
escape the specter of war through
table talk, after all. But we can
look on the bright side: at least they
puta T.V. in the Commons.

Rather than having to grasp for
topics of conversation, we now
have the option of focusing our
grim visage on the image of Peter
Jennings. That should cheer us up.

Contrary to the estimates of
the department of military saniti-

replaced “killed” with “not thor-
oughly successful in liberative
efforts”) the gulf war will proba-

thorized the use of force, and
Congress has given President Bush
the right to exercise. that option;
yet Ms. Ott states that she and her
colleagues cannot support the
troop’s “boss.”

Mr. Bush is not acting alone;
he is the instrument of interna-
tional will. Ms. Ott simply
“disagree(s) with the administra-
tion that put them there,” Perhaps
Ms. Ott and her colleagues should
direct their energies towards the
administration that really put them
there--Saddam Hussein’s. (Her
freedom of expression would.not
be so closely guarded in Iraq.)

Ms. Ott also states that they
“gather forpeace with the troops in
mind--not out of antagonism.” She
seems sincere; so are those people
who actually have relatives in the
gulf.

One such person, Dennis Olto-
rik of Cincinnati, Ohio told USA

All we can do to effectively
support the troops is to hope and
pray for their swift and safe return
from combat.

P.S. Special thanks to Ellen
Ott for stating this case so well on
her poster presently hanging out-
side of Chambers. Please, take
note that she had the courage to put
her name below her words rather
than cower in the pathetic ano-
nymity chosen by the abusive and
uncivil hawks. ©

are not only willing to fight, but
seem to have an accurate under-
standing of the factors that moti-
vated their presence. Ms. Ott’s
concern for the safety of those
soldiers stationed in the gulf is a
thinly veiled attack on the United
Nations’ imperative that territorial
aggrandizement cannot be an in-
strument of foreign policy. Do we
agree with Ms. Ott?

“Not.”

Inour humble butcorrect opin-
ion, this kind of invidious protest
demoralizes the “troops.” + Our
soldiers have enough to worry
about without the specter of an-
other Vietnam, and the associated
protests, further destabilizing their
confidence.

It is imperative that we show
our support forthe uwoops” as well
as the leaders of this country.

Surrender must come from
Iraq.

Hussein necessitated these
actions with his aggression and
total disregard for the world com-
munity; now he must initiate peace.

Ms. Ott's concern for the safety of these soldiers
... 18 a thinly veiled attack on the United
Nations’ imperative that territorial aggrandize-
ment cannot be an instrument of foreign policy.

Today that he hopes his brother
Thomas is “being strong and. . .
concentrating on his job and not
worrying about us.”

Ms. Ott says that they realize
that “the men and women in the
gulf are doing a job,” but she and
others like her won’t let our sol-
diers do their jobs to the best of
their ability...

Instead, her ‘contention that
those serving in the gulfare merely
“doing a job,” with the implicit
understanding that they afe there
against their will, is false.

By all the accounts we’ ve seen
of media interviews, the “troops”

Our soldiers are the ones who will
have to convince him that this is
the will of the world and they need
our support.

As Senator Jesse Helms (vic-
tor, you will recall, over former
senatorial candidate H. Gantt) said
on January 12th, “There are cer-
tain occasions: in the history of
nations when people are called
upon to.reaffirm the integrity of
the national interest. This is one of
those occasions. . . if we allow
aggression to disrupt our relation-
ships with friendly governments,
the strength and independence of
the United States is threatened.”

Can We Have Fair Faculty Evaluations?

Praise Will Montgomery for
writing an interesting article of rele-
vance to all! I know how badly
students need extra information,
especially incoming freshmen, who
are expected to get by ona sheaf of
green papers and one-sentenced
descriptions. I personally also
know the difficulties involved in
starting one.

Last year, as a freshmen, a
bunch of hallmates and I began
thinking about a student course
guide. We first envisioned an en-
tirely student-run publication, util-

izing a Consumer Reports format.
But as Montgomery pointed out,
this approach can easily lead to li-
belous publications. How could
we have a fair, objective publica-
tion? A publicationrun entirely by
the “student body” would in fact
berun by asmall group of students
editors, each with their own opin-
ions. Secondly, there’s the danger,
as Montgomery said, of it becom-
ing a popularity contest.

“But there is a way to do this.
We came up with it after seeing
Dean Terry and Sue Ross, and I

think it’s good. We simply have to
get the teachers involved.

Imagine a page for each pro-
fessor, with a two by two photo in
the top right comer and a list of
biographical info.

Then imagine an interview
with each professor, asking him
first fora general description of his
teachign philosophy (every prof
has one), one that highlights what
he is not as well as what he is.

Thencomethe questions about
specific courses. What focus does
this class have? What types of

material do you require for it? What
makes your course different from
other courses in the department, or
your specific class in relation to
other sections?

This system has several ad-
vantages. First, it lets the bad
professors damn _ themselves.
Secondly, it gives good professors
a chance to explain their classes
more Clearly, something the pres-
ent course guide does not allow.
Moreover, by supporting this en-
terprise, they would be staving off
the “dirty little books” that existon

other campuses.

Wouldn’t teachers simply lie?
Some might, but if their peer fac-
ulty let them know that they took it
seriously, then mendacious profs
would lose face not only among
students but among their peers.

This is just one proposal, and I
think it works better asa Freshman
Course Guide than as an Upper-
classmen Guide. Whatever is
decided, it will be a lot of work.
My friends and I were forced to
give up our plans once we hit so-
phomore year.
