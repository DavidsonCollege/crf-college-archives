Question

of the Week

The Athletic Association has re-
cently passed the rule that all men
out for a team must eat at’ the
training table. This has aroused
and provoked quite a bit of discus-
sion. A few ideas follow on: “Should

Athletic Association Require
All Men Out For Any Sport To
Eat At The Training Table?”
Johnny Tice, Senior:

“Tam against any such movement.
It hurts the present boarding house
system. Merely eating at the train-
ing table does not affect the ath-
lete’s training, since it’s not what
you eat, but how you eat. From
what I’ve the food is better
at the individual boarding houses.”

seen

Jimmy Cooper, junior:

“No. If having all athletes eat-
ing together would improve team]
spirit, I'd be all for having this |
rule. But ask the man who will be |
forced to leave his regular board-|
ing house, and you will find many
of them dissatisfied with the fee |
set-up; several definitely
posed to leaving that they have)
considered dropping their sport.)
Many fraternity men would miss}
being with their fraternity broth-
ers at meal time.

|

so op-

Some who have

part time jobs would be ‘out of |
luck.’ The food is no better. The}
individual boarding houses with}

three or four more leaving would |
be seriously handicapped, as they]
have already. I’m}
satisfied with things ‘as is’.”
Bill Telford, senior:

“T am against the compulsion of
athletes eating at the training table,

to cut corners

because the-food is poorer than at
the boarding houses. Many boys |
have jobs at their boarding houses |
or are in line for one which they|
would tose if compelled to eat at a
training table. The fraternity board-
ing houses give jobs to their ath-
letes with the understanding that
their boys will not be compelled to
leave. The individual boarding house
ladies and their managers and wait-
ers would in many cases be severe-
ly hurt by the deser-
tion of half a dozen boys to the
training table.” :

compelled

Tom Galbreath, sophomore:
“Yes, I think it’s a good idea for

trainingstable. By doing so they get
the proper.and necessary foods to
build up and maintain their strength
and stamina. Here their diet is
watched for them, and they don't
have to worry about\choosing only
those things which they should
eat. Such a system should get the
hearty cooperation of all athletes.”
Tom McAlpine, junior:

“If this system is adopted per-
manently it will seriously hurt the
other boarding houses. A lot ‘of boys
who are not sure of making the
team wouldn’t even go out if they
had to forfeit eating with their
fraternity brothers. The Athletic
Association does not have a right
to force the boys to eat at the
training table unless the boys are
given scholarships, or board at a
reduced rate. All those who have
half time jobs at their present
boarding houses would have to pay
the straight monthly board and thus
lose $12.50 per month.”

Bob Doty, junior:

“All of the fraternities have their
own boarding houses, and since the
fraternity members do not live to-
gether, the boarding houses are one
of the most important factors in
maintaining the close relation which
should exist between fraterity bro-
thers. If a student is forced to eat
at the training table he loses one
of his greatest assets as a fraternity
member, that of cementing his most
personal and closest friendships by
daily jntercourse with those friends.”
Bob’ Scarborough, junior:

“Yes, I think it is a good idea for
all participants in varsity, and fresh-
man sports to be required to eat
at the training table. For here their
diet is watched which is of vital
importance in maintaining a good
physical condition, Also close com-
panionship among teammates brings
about a stronger spirit and reliance
upon one another.

has not been

On last Tuesday night, November
8, the members of the Sigma Up-
silon fraternity held their regu-
lar’ semi-monthly meeting at the
Phi Gam House.

The program was opened by the
reading of an initiatory paper by
Tom Perrin called “The Difficulty
of Writing a Paper.” In this paper
Perrin pointed out how difficult it
is to choose a subject upon which to
write, and he showed the hardships
in writing after a subject was se-
lected.

Following Tom Perrin was Gene
Liipfert, who read an initiatory of-
fering of two short papers which
he called “Fantasy.” The subjects
of Liipfert’s papers were only
dreams that the author had experi-
enced, but they were presented in
yery graphic form, the emphasis be-
ing placed on the wording of the
selection.

Rut Miller then presented an ac-
count, in story form, of an experi-
ence that he had had while vaca-
tioning on the.New England coast
several years ago,

After the programwas presented,
business was discussed. Bob Ram-

sey was elected steward of the
group to take place of Jack Hol-
land. Jack Holland was elected

treasurer in the place of Sam Spen-
cer; who recently resigned this of=
fice.

Ed Morrow, head of the program
committee, then presented the ar-
rangement for the programs for the
remaining meetings of the year.
Each program.is to have four main
parts. At each meeting some mem-
ber will be assigned an essay, an-
other a short story, another a book
report or some original poetic of-
fering, and a fourth will be thosen
to write a chapter in the novel
which the chapter is writing. This
novel deals with the life story of
a boy going through Davidson Col-
lege.
