Tennis waits for improvement after losses

By RICK JOHNSTON
Staff Writer

Unknown to many, the tennis
team has been the most suc-
cessful athletic team at David-
son in recent years. In the past
decade, it has compiled a record
of 181 wins and 61 losses, twice
has won the Southern Con-
ference Championship, and
three times has been undefeated
in conference play.

With the best record of all
Davidson sports in the 70’s, the
tennis team may possess the
most difficult schedule as well.
Schools from all over the east-
ern United States appear on the
schedule, including those of the
ACC, SEC, and Big Ten. A few
teams ranked among the top
twenty in the nation are always
included in the tennis team’s
schedule.

Two former Davidson adver-
saries have enjoyed success in
the professional ranks. Keith

- Richardson, formerly of Appa-
lachian State, advanced to the
third round of the U.S. Open
this past September, while John

Sadri of N.C. State has recently’

defeated two of the world’s best
players—Stan Smith and Vitas
Gerulaitis.

Harry Griffith and Jay Gep-
fert lead this year’s squad,
alternating at the number one
position. They are outstanding
singles players in their own
right, but together they are the
doubles team to beat in the
Southern Conference.

At the number three and four
spots are Nevins Todd and Rick

Johnston. These two players —

have had the rare privilege of
being- invited to the National

Junior Championships, where

: 128 of the best young players in | ie

the country compete for t}

Jeff Lyle and Nick Petrou,
both highly ranked regional
players, fill out the starting
lineup at the number five and
six slots. Bill Bennett is often
substituted into the lineup,
while Paul Griffith, _Jim
Haynes, Alan Lasenby, and

.Jeff Wall are also expected to

see much action. Victor Taylor,
the team’s top freshman, is out
for much of the season with a
knee injury and will be sorely
missed.

Coach Jeff Frank (133-47)
expects Davidson to be a strong
contender for the Southern Con-
ference crown. This year any
one of five teams could win the

(Trey Thies)

championship, and no one team
is favored.

The Cats’ current record is
2-4, which is expected to im-
prove. Losses have been to
Alabama, Wake Forest, UNC,
and N.C. State, who are among
the top teams in the country.
Victories have been over Roch-
ester and Amherst, but the real
test will be the conference
matches which will begin in a
few weeks.

The next match will be a-
gainst Ohio University on the
Davidson courts. Everyone is
invited to cheer for the Cats
and to observe some of the
finest tennis in this area.

Dead dog art in Tennessee
Several furry little animals dead

(CPS) A University of Ten-
nessee policeman, making his
rounds just past midnight,
noticed an awfully curious smell
coming from the university’s
Art Center last week. Sure
enough, upon investigation he
found an unusual exhibit: a
dead dog in the lobby encircled
by a careful display of black
beans and rice. Nearby was a
similarly artful display of a
dead skunk.

Art Department Chairman

Donald Kurka later told the UT
Daily Beacon the animals ‘‘were

- arranged like a display. The

main problem was the smell.”

The smell was so bad that,
despite the efforts of a fumiga-
tion team, classes had to be
moved out of the building for a
day.

“TI assume it was someone’s
idea of art,” Kurka told College
Press Service. “It’s not mine,
though.”’
