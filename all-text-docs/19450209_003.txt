Along with. the

many good _ boys
who are not here
this semester, is

‘Jim Lowry. Jim
was a great basket-
ball player as well
as a swell fellow. In
all the games _ this
season, Lowry has
béen the — star
spark-plug » of. the
team. The team was
built around Lowry
for in most of the
games he was the

By FRITZ KEESLER best man on the
floor. Because of his accurate sét shots and cool thinking
during a game he was named on the All Southern Confer-
ence team. The News called Lowry the “Cassius of the
Courts” because of his lean and hungry look, but that
statement had a double meaning for Jim proved to be a
dagger in the back of Davidson’s opponents. We all miss
him‘as a friend and as a swell basketball player. He will
never be forgotten.

Lowry is not the only bsketball player who has left
the Ravigson court, Gabby Bryant has quit school for
the durafion, also Phil Edwards. The team will miss these
two. Gabby with his fighting spirit and Phit with his com-
plete collectiveness have made names for themselves in the
Davidson hall of sports.

Without these men the team is pretty well torn up. A
sports writer in the Charlotté Observer said, ‘I don’t think
Davidson will win another game.”” This was proved to be
a false statement when the Cats defeated th College of
Charleston. The team does not look the same, but at times
it seems to be its old self. It seems doubtful now if the
team will get to go to the Southern Conference tourna-
ment. However, you can’t tell what Coach Shepard can
do with his boys.

Fraternity basketball will start again, now that exams
are over. It should prove exciting. The S. P. E.’s who
were winning have lost Owens and Neill to the Varsity,
and other frats have gained men. . You can’t ever tell who
will win, now, so watch it closely, for it will be fun for all,

We profoundly believe
that there is nothing
like Varsity - Town's
Covert topper. It can
be worn more months
in the year than any
other coat; it’s com-
fortable, it’s styleful,
it’s practical. We know
that once you've worn
one of these coats,
you'll never be without
one... it’s great!

CATS WIN AT CHARLESTON

Beat Maroons
In Close Game

The Davidson Wildcats defeated
the College of Charleston Maroons
32 to 28 in a close and exciting game.
The Cats started out slowly but fi-
nally got going. Linwood O’Briant
played an outstanding game and was
high scorer with 14 points. Owens,
Blackburn and Wall also looked
very good on the court.

The Charleston Maroons, a small
and scrappy team; took the lead
early in the game but the Cats over-
took them before half time and
managed to keep the lead through
the remainder of a close game,

Citadel Takes

Citadel defeated the Wildcats 52-
32 at Charleston in a game which
1 At one
time in the first time it looked as if
it would be very close for the score
was 20 to 16. However, the Wild-
cats got no more in this half which
ended 27 to 16. From then on it
was just how much Citadel would
beat the Cats by. When Citadel
comes, to Davidson the 13th of this
month maybe it will be a different
story.

was slow and unexciting.

Let's hope so, hmn?
