Sports and War

In an earlier column, attention called the
changes that were taking place throughout the country in the
-sporting world—because of the war. Large universities are
completely dropping major sports from their schedules, pro-
fessional teams are being ruined by men enlisting and being
drafted into the army, traditional contests that have thrilled the
public for years are being postponed for the duration, and ‘to
top-all of the confusion, some people are demanding to total
discontinuance of athletics for various and seemingly senseless
reasons. Should there be a d
thé war? eas,

‘6. This question is answered by that narrow-minded
group with an emphatic, yes! They claim that a
nation in war should have no time, to be either en-
gaging in or watching sports events, and that the
people should be constantly aware of their danger and
continuously working with this in mind, without any
distraction from their work by such useless pastimes
as‘a sport of any kind.

Class Softball

With only one game to play. the Seniors and Juniors
were in a dead-lock Monday for the lead in the Inter-
Class Softball Tournament. Both teams have won
four games with only_one—lossagainst_them. The
Seniors lost their first game to the Freshmen, but came
back in the return encounter to down them easily and
have not lost since. The Juniors lost their one game
to the Seniors in a ten-inning game, yet beat the
Frosh easily both times which adds to the confusion.
The Sophomores, as usual, are behind with no: wins,
but manage to give each team a hard fight. The
Juniors’and Seniors barely eked out by them, both
winning by only a one-run margin.

Fraternity softball is next in the schedule and it looks the
K, A.’s will be the téam to beat. They have in David Thomas
one of the best pitchers in the league, witha pretty good infield
to back himwup. The Nappa Sigs are expected to give them a
tough battle with a well rounded team, and “the Madame”
Marsh on the mound. The S. P. E.’s Phi Gams, and Pikas,
should be close behind and may take the lead from the favored

two.
Cats Beat Wofford

Wofford’s nine was really set back on their heels when
the Cats cut loose on them in the game here Monday.
Davidson finally. succeeded in knocking a pitcher out
of the box having a big inning in which they counted
eight runs. Featured was Dave Maloney’s home run
—a blow making the center fielder cut off a 220 yard
dash along the track to the far end of the stadium.
Lefty Paul Neisler looked good in the win having
Wofford well in hand during the entire game.

Davidson's showing was all the
more creditable in view of the fact
that the competition was even keen-

National Intercollegiate Tourney
held last year in Columbus, Ohio.
A thirty-six hole total of'455- was
