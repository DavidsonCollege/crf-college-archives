SGA Referendum Notice

There is a referendum on Monday, October 29, from 9.a.m. to 3 p.m. in Chambers and in
the Union about Freshman Advisor Elections and adding Hobart Park and WALT to
ongoing Charters (so they don't have to submit a charter every year). SGA has to do this

by referendum of the student body because of the way it is written.
Proposed Referendum

I agree that the Freshman Advisor(s) election should be removed from the SGA bylaws on the condition that
the Dean of Students Office handle Freshman Advisor selection in the following way:

1) The Freshman Advisor team must consist of one male Hall Counselor and one female Hall Counselor.

2) Submit an application by teams no later than 8 a.m. two Tucsdays prior to the Thanksgiving break. The
application would consist of their reasons for applying and thcir statement of goals.

13) Aclosed forum will be held at the Hall Counselor meeting prior to the Thanksgiving break where the
candidates will have the opportunity to discuss their goals before an audience consisting of current Hall

Counselors, current Freshman Advisors, and at least four representatives from both the Residence Life Office
and the Dean of Students Office.

14) After all of the candidates have answered questions posed by the forum, a vote will be taken by
cofifidential ballot,* and the votes will be counted by the Chancellor of the Student Government Associa-
tion. The team receiving the majority of the votes will assume the responsibilities of Freshman Advisors upon
notification by the Chancellor.

5) The term of the Freshman Advisors will extend from the above vote until May of their senior year.

Freshman Advisors will be responsible for the Hall Counselor team which they selected throughout the entire
year.

* All Hall Counselors are required to vote. Absentee ballots will be collected prior to the forum.

Media Board stated in Article IX: Chartering of Organizations of the SGA Bylaws to read as follows: -

-MOVING UP HAS A WHOLE
DIFFERENT MEANING FOR -
AIR FORCE ROTC CADETS.

- Virtually all college students plan to move up in their
career. But Air Force ROTC cadets can-begin the train-
ing toward a career that goes higher and faster. In fact, if
you'd like to begin a life in the sky, your best first step is
Air Force ROTC. ~

You'll learn the confidence you'll need whether
you’re going to plot acourse as a navigator or take the
controls-as-a pilot. FAA-approved flight lessons will
launch you for the first time. And as your college career
develops, so do the skills you'll need as an Air Force
officer.

Begin early in college, and you'll be eligible for schol-
arships that can pay expenses and provide you $100
each-academic month, tax-free. After graduation, you'll
be ready to take the challenge of an intensive, rigorous
training program.

Move up with Air Force ROTC now, and you can
move up with the Air Force as an officer. Contact your

, campus Air Force representative:
