several weeks ago has apparent-

which many expected it would.
The main cause of its lack of

Paul Anderson Lifts 65 Pounds

Anderson Urges Union
Of Christianity, Sports

Paul Anderson, the ‘world’s
strongest man,” interspersed
feats of strength with a plea for
Christian understanding and a
union of athletics and Christian-
ity in chapel Wednesday.

Anderson, who was sponsored
by the local chaper of the Fel-
lowship of Christian Athletes,
opened his talk with a demon-
stration of carpentry without a
hammer. He drove a_ nail
through two boards by using his
hand as a hammer.

He then related a story of a
trip he made from Augusta, Ga.
to his home in Vidalia. Ga. in a
car whose headlights would not
dim, much to the anger of pass-
ing motorists. He used the story

to illustrate his point that people
today do not understand each
other.

Then he told the story of the
founding’ of the FCA by a bas-
ketball coach who thought that
athletes should use their in-
fluence for God and understand-
ing instead of for tobacco and
liquor advertisers.

His next feat of strength was
lifting two 65 pound weights.
holding the two weights at arms
length on. the little fingers of
each hand.

He then closed the show with a
smaller edition of the feat that
earnec' him the title of “world's
strongest man.” He has official-

In selecting counselors for the
trip. the Charlotte Observer ask-
ed Davidson to select several
candidates for the position of

counselor. “‘We did not apply,”
Rikard said. “We were told that
he had been nominated and were
asked to send autobiographical
sketches to Parade headquarters
in New York. The week before
exams I found out that I had
been selected.”

Every newspaper which car-
ries Parade magazine selects
one of its carriers who shows

back, but at chapel he lifted off
the floor eight Davidson FCA
members who were sitting on a
platform.

The main defect in the project
seems to be the time in the
semester at which the professors
received the sheets. ‘I did not
pick up the announcement until
almost the last day of the se-
mester,’’ said Dr. A. G. Griffin.
professor of economics, ‘‘and 1
simply did not have the time to
pass out the sheets.”’

Another professor admitted
that he “‘just forgot about the
evaluation sheets.’’ Professor
Richard Cole of the English De-
partment, who did pass out the
sheets, said that he picked his
up on the last day and attributed
the poor response partly to this
fact.

All the professors seemed very

enthusiastic about the critique .

value of the comments of the

Lions Club Awards
Prize To Seigler

The Davidson Lions Club re-
cently awarded a $75 savings
bond to junior Bill Seigler for
his essay submitted in the Lions
Club Peace Essay Contest.

Seigler, a history major from
Mt. Airy, received the award at
a banquet meeting of the Lions
Club Jan. 23. As the winner of
the local contest. his paper has
been submitted for the regional
competition.

Using “Fear and Peace" as
the topic of his 5,000-word essay.
Seigler pointed out the failures
of the balance of power theory
of world government.

“In my paper.”’ Seigler said,
“T tried to show how the balance
of power had failed to maintain
peace, as can be seen in the
First and Second World Wars
and the current ‘“free-world’’-
communist dichotomy.

“As a possible remedy,” he
continued, “I advocated the es-
tablishment of an unbiased world
legal authority, not influenced
by national prejudices and en-
dowed with the power to estab-
lish. precedents and enforce its

‘rulings in international affairs.”

Sunday Night Open House

The homes of the following professors will be
open to students Sunday night at 8:30. The names

on the question concerning any
unconscious mannerisms of the
professors which might bother
the students.

None of the professors seemed
to object to negative criticism if
it could help correct any flaws
in their teaching or courses.

Professor George Core of the
English Department mentioned.
however, ,that students ‘‘might
base their criticism on their
grades at.the time they filled
the sheets out."

Workman, who said he has
used similar evaluation sheets
for years, also pointed out that
there may be opposing reactions
about the content of a course,
depending upon the different
types and abilities of students.

Griffin summarized the feel-
ings of almost all the professors
when he said that the sentiments
of the critique are ‘‘valid, con-
structive, necessary criticism
which can reveal enlightening
and perceptive thinking on the
part of the student.”
