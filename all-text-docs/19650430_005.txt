THE NEW LOOK . . . SCHEDULE

Last week the following Davidson 1965 football

schedule was announced:

Davidson

Sept. 18 Presbyterian
25 Greenville, S. C.

Furman

Oct. 2 The Citadel Charleston, S. C.

16 William and Mary Davidson

23 VMI (Homecoming) Davidson

30 George Washington Washington, D. C.
Nov. 6 Lehigh Davidson

13 Lafayette Easton, Pa.

20 Wofford Davidson

25 Bucknell Charlotte

Dropping Richmond and Mississippi College, the
*’Cats pick up three new foes, giving them the first
ten-game football schedule at Davidson since 1949.

The first of these three new foes is William and
Mary, no real stranger to Davidson football. Next
year the Indians should easily be more powerful than
either of the two Wildcat opponents that they are
replacing.

Last year’s William and Mary freshman team
was undefeated. .

The second new team to face the 'Cats next year
is George Washington. The Colonials are ranked by
many as the class of the’ Southern Conference for
next year. ~

Assistant Coach Dick Tomey admits, “George
Washington should be one of the best, if not the
best in the conference next year.”

Bucknell rounds out the new additions to the
1965 schedule. Undoubtedly it will be the strong-
est team on the slate for next year.

Last year Bucknell won the Middle Atlantic Con-
ference (same one in which Lehigh and Lafayette

lay).
P Besides being their conference’s champions,
Bucknell took the Lambert trophy for the best small
college in the East.

Win, lose, or draw, next year’s team faces the
strongest football schedule of any Davidson football
team in recent memory. Opponent-wise, at least
Davidson has already moved up plenty in football.

OPEN LETTER . . . TRUSTEES

Dear Sirs:

No doubt your hands are full of busi-
ness. The proposed fraternity changes, vespers
and chapel anachronisms, faculty oath, and
drinking rules give you little chance for a
breather, must less additional considerations.
But I still offer you some.

Davidson's sports program is in need of
a few changes also. Time and time again people
cry out for their pet projects, and I realize it is
impossible to satisfy all of these. However the
changes I suggest are not just mine alone, nor is
this the first year that their need has been
voiced.

When Coach Driesell brought Davidson
big-time basketball, he also enlarged an already
strong group of basketball fans, followers, and
part-time, for-fun basketball players.

But so far big-time basketball, and en-
larged groups of basketball-playing students
have led to no enlargements of basketball facil-
ities.

So, point number one, again this year is
a plea for funds for an extension of the gym.
There is room for an addition behind the gym
that could hold two basketball courts and en-
large the already cramped and crowded hand-
bali facilities.

I'm no voice crying alone in a wilder-
ness on this. Dr. Tom Scott, athletic director
here (you remember him, don’t you?), has been
beggging for funds for this for several years.

Last year a student body poll showed an
overwhelming desire and need for these addi-
tions. There is room for them and unquestion-
ably there is a need for them.

The second suggestion I offer you is con-
siderably cheaper. (I figured you'd like to know
that). It is still a much needed addition to Da-
vidson sports and recreation facilities. This year
physical education classes started using Lake
Norman. The school owns one motor boat, one
sailboat, and three canoes.

Individual students can forget ever using
these things however. Every weekend (week days
are taken up by freshman and sophomore PE
classes) long waiting lists face any student who
wants to use a sailboat.

As a minimum the college needs six sail-
boats to accommodate student demands for the
sport. One boat is a pitiful gesture at utilizing
the potentially boundless recreational oppor-
tunities Lake Norman offers.

The one motor boat is so rare and pre-
cious that the school can’t afford to let it out
for individual skiing use. Another power boat is
a necessity if any student recreation like skiing
is even to be contemplated on an individual

basis.

The need is really pressing for these lake
improvements. The cost is not great, but the
funds you can provide for such improvement
are non-existant as far as the budget is con-

cerned.
| could go on but I'll stop here. These

two things I have suggested you give us may
seem minor compared to other needs we cry out

for.

oe mes. meee -

Still, my suggestions are not half-cocked,
wild-eyed ideas. They are material, hard and
fast suggestions for actions that bring actual,
visible, tangible improvements.

A vote for funds to improve the athletic
facilities of this school involves no philisophical
stand on the moral rights and wrongs of drink-
ing, fraternities, faculty oaths, or attending vesp-
ers. It is a sure, safe, way to improve Davidson
College without betraying any hallowed tradi-
tions.

Almost too good to pass up?!

“HE FLIES THROUGH THE AIR.. .”
Ecstatic Jake Jacobsen Collects Hit Off VPI

_ Davidson coach Tom Stevens,

By TOM COOK
Davidsonian Sportswriter

Having picked up their fourth
victory of the season this
week by taking VPI 5-4, the
Davidson baseball team jour-
neys to Lexington. Va., for an
afternoon doubleheader against
VMI tomorrow afternoon. Pitch-
ing for the Wildcats will be
seniors Howard Bryan and

' Dave Johnson.

After the series against the
who, according to

“have a real good club this

year,’ the ‘Cats return home

to seek revenge against Bel-

- mont Abbey Tuesday afternoon
. at 3 p.m. In an earlier game

this #ason, the ‘Monks’ de-

*\ feated Davidson 7-2 at Belmont.

Coach stevens, reflecting on
this season’s dismal 4-19 record,
observed, “We're not hitting.
and we're hot producing runs.
We get’ men on base, bu: we
can't score.”

On the team's defense Stev-
ens noted. “We continue to
make errors (five in two games
Monday).’’ He has juggled his
lineup slightly by depending on
Claude Owen at first base and

moving Sonny Graves to third
base. Shoristop Jim Hyder's
companion up the middle of the
infield has been either John
Little or Jake Jacobsen.

In the outfield Lance Walker
in left and Dick Snyder in
center are solid fixtures, and
Jacobsen and Bryant Hinnant
have taken their turns in right.
Coach Stevens noted, ‘“‘Hinnant
has not been hitting and he
should be.”

{n the catching depariment
Stevens has been using both
Skip Waite and Jim Terry. Hit-
ting is again a factor there
because “Terry is still not hit-
ting and Waite’s not been hi-
ing lately.”

in their five games last week-
end and this week, the Cats
lost_ twice to Georgia Southern,
split a double header with Vir-
ginia Tech, and lost Wednesday
2 to North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.

Against. the Gobblers, David-
son was, hurt by two errors in
the first game, and fell 3-1 in
a close. pitcher's duel. But in
the-sécond game Walker's triple
in the bottom of the seventh
inning tied the score at four-
all. In the bottom of the eighth

This week ended with a
three-way tie for first place
in the IMAC softball stand-
ings. Following Thursday’s
action, the Sig Ep’s, Phi
Delt’s, and SAE’s led the
pack with four wins, while
each had but one loss to its
credit.

In Monday's action, the Pika’s
also with one loss, but only
three wins, displayed their brute
power by smashing the Indc-
pendenis 11-2, while the KA's
edged the Be a's 54.

According to Beja pinch hte

scribed the peg as “straight and

and a brie! debate ensued on
whether a Tunner could score

would not agree, however, that
the clubs were ‘evenly match-

Stevens Starts Swim,
Drops Football Chores

Tom Stevens has been relieved of his duties as
assistant football coach and named head coach of the
Davidson College swimming program, Dr. Tom Scott,
Athletic Director, announced this week.

“Stevens will continue duties as head baseball
coach and physical education instructor, but will be
freed from assistant football coaching duties in order
that he may devote more time to the development of
the other two sports,” Dr. Scott reported.

“Stevens’ contribution to our athletic program
has been a large one. With the additions in the past
two years of a full time trainer and another man
each in football and basketball, we are now able to
look toward a better balanced staff all around, allow-
ing us to place a more proper emphasis on baseball
as well as swimmnig.

“We anticipate the possibility of fall baseball
practice as one of the first fruits of this change. This
extra opportunity for baseball practice under Coach
Stevens should give a major boost to the sport here,”
Dr. Scott added.

Davidson's baseball team this year has posted a
4-14 record after being third in the conference last
year. °

As swimming coach, Stevens will be taking over
duties formerly carried by assistant football coach
Dwight Shoe, who leaves the athletic staff this June.

Stevens’ move from the football staff leaves
Coach Homer Smith with assistants Dick Tomey,

Kenneth Blair and Dave Fagg.

(LARRY) OUTLAW SCARES DAVID JENNINGS
But He's Out Anyway

’Cats Falter In Relays
As E. Tennessee Wins

By TOMMY COX
Davidsonian Sportswriter

Davidson lost its own 12-team Relays Saturday for the first time in the seven-
year history of the event. A strong East Tennessee State team and bad luck were too
much for the thinclads, although the margin was a slim four points, 64-60.

Other teams scoring in the
meet were: Lenoir Rhyne, 39%:
Cumberland, 30; Washington
and Lee, 25; Catawba, 20%;
Fredrick, 15; High Point, 13%:
Emory, 12% Appalachian, 6:
and Wofford, 1.

“This is one of the finest Re-
lays we've had as far as’ com-
petition is concerned. We'll have
16-20 teams here next year,”
commented track coach Heath
Whittle. “The whole Davidson
team did an outstanding job.

We're proud of our team.”

Six meet records, three by
Davidson teams, reflected the
stiff competition and strength of
the ‘Cats. ‘Tom Watson, Dennis
Phillips. Tom Heffner, and
Ronnie Reese broke the dis:ance
medley record, and Alan Turn-
er, Watson, Steve Gill, and Star
Evans ran a 42.7 440-yard relay
for another record.

In the most exciting race of
the afternoon Heffner, Phillips,
John Barrow, and Reese com-

bined for a 2-mile relay victory
and record.

The team travels to Winston-
Salem Friday for a dual meet
with Wake Forest. Originally
scheduled for Saturday, the
meet {involves both varsity and
freshmen teams.

Whittle said of the team's
chances against the subsidized
ACC team, “If everyone's in
good shape physically, we've got
a real good chance. I think it
will be a fine meet.”

Hill.
Champ Covington was low

“i man against State for the ‘Cats

with a 75, followed by Doug
McKeever with a 76.

Dr. Tom Scott, the coach of
the linkmen explained that, ‘We
were a little handicapped by
cuts because the members of
the team will have to cut three
M-W-F classes in the next two

;| weeks."°

Six of the team's seven losses
have come at the hands of ACC
teams. Their record is now 8-7.

On Monday, the. golfers
travel to the Cascades course
at Hot Springs, Va. for a 3-way
match with George Washington
and West Virginia.

Dr. Scott is very optimistic
about the team’s chances of
walking away with the honors,
This will also be a chance for
the members to become famil-
iar with the extremely fast “bent
grass greens'’ on this course
before playing there in the
Southern Conference tournament
on the 10th, 11th, and 12th of
this month.

ents to the home fans for the
next-to last time as they return.
ed t6 the home courts for the
VPI Monday.

Said Fogleman of the Gob
blers, who aiso fell 9-0, *‘They
don’t have anything. They don’t
have a very good set-up up
there, and I doubt if they've
even played ten matches. I don't
even think the scores mean any-
thing.”’

Accordingly, Bill Council
trounced his bumbling opponent
6-0, 6-0, and Esmond Phelps ap-
plied the usual mental and phy-
sical torture to his dismayed
foe, Abner Abitt. The noncha-
lant Phelps continually returned
Abbitt’s best shots and added
some offensive acrobatics to win
6-3, 6-0.

Bill Schutt, playing in the
number three position, encount-
ered the man Fogleman describ-
ed as, “‘the best player on their
team.”’ Schutt had a hard time
in the first set and was down
4-5 at one point, but he held
service until he made his break
at 6-6 and went on to win 8-6.
The second set followed easily.

Dick Hurd, who started siow-
ly this season, won his match
easily, and his play mustered
the comment, ‘I think he's fin-
ally coming around some now,”
from Fogleman. .

Peter Parrott extended his
singles record to 17). and Geor-

dic. Mueller registered his 4th

win against but one defeat.

Schutt) and Phelps combined
to take the number one doubles
match from VPI's undefeated
duo, though they were extended
to three sets. Counci! and Par-
rott played in the number two,
and Hurd and Mueller in the
number three slots.

Freshmen Woody Faulk and
“Pinky” Hatcher played VPI's
first two freshmen in a pair of
singles matches and soundly de-
feated them.

Concerning his  oft-changed
doubles combinations. Fogleman
said. “They're set. This is the
way they'll be in the tourna-
ment.”

Yesterday the Wildcats travel-
ed to Boone to play their rained-
out Wednesday match with Ap-
patachian State. Not losing a
Single set the ‘Cats took appa-
lachian 9-0.

The ‘Cats wind up the season
with Wake Forest here today
and a visit to Duke Tuesday.
Davidson defeated Wake last
year, but lost a close rain-de-
layed match to the Blue Devils.

Fogleman said, ‘‘Wake will
probably be stronger than last
year but, I believe we'll take
both Duke and Wake this year.
