Class flag tradition revived

TAINE ALISON
Assistant Features Editor
There's a new standard at

Davidson—it’s flying from the
flagpole! The new red and black
flag represents the Class of 1979
and flies in their honor from
Convocation until Commence-
ment.

A class flag is not a new idea,
pointed out Dr. Richard Burts,
registrar; it is a revival of a
Davidson tradition from days
gone by.

“It was Dr. Spencer who
planted the idea—he just got
me to look into it,” explained
Burts. ‘I don’t know much
about flags, but I’ve gotten a
liberal education in the pro-
cess.”

The process of having a flag
made began with Mrs. E.N.
Linker, famous in the area for
her sewing skills. Mrs. Linker
could not do the job herself, but
referred Burts to the Conder
Flag Company in Charlotte.
After consulting the ROTC
department for more informa-
tion, Burts talked with Mr.
Conder— America’s largest flag
dealer.

“He’s a very interesting gen-
tleman,’’ remarked Burts.
‘‘When I commented on his
importance in the flag business
he only chuckled and said that if
he had taken stock in buggy
whips, he would probably be
America’s largest buggy whip
dealer.”’

It isn’t hard to see why
Conder is such a successful
businessman. He and Burts
worked out the specifications of

the 1979 class flag that could be
flown outside as well as in
indoor ceremonies.

When the flag was first.

finished, Conder found: the
workmanship unsatisfactory
and returned it to the manufac-
turer for improvement —all this
at no cost to the college.

The flag was first used at
Spring Convocation when the
seniors wore their caps and
gowns for the first time. Senior
Class President Ralph Yielding
bore the standard and led his
classmates into the ceremony.

The flag will also be carried at
Commencement. This old tradi-
tion will complement the cur-
rent practice of using the
American flag and flags from
the fifty states as a backdrop
for the speaker’s platform at
Commencement.

The revival of the class flag
led to another idea—a college
flag. The new.college flag is an
indoor flag complete with fringe
and an embroidered seal. It will
be a lasting symbol of the
college to be used for years to
come.

Burts said that the college
would like for the idea of a class
flag to catch on, and be contin-
ued, though ‘‘Not beyond a
proper point.’’ If the rising
senior class objects to the
practice, it can be discontinued.

The class of 1979's flag will be
given to the Alumni office after
Commencement for use during
class reunions. ‘‘We would like
the flag to become a rallying
point for the Class of 1979.”

Plott and Oratorio Singers receive extended ovations

By PATSY DANIELS

Had conductor of the Ora-
torio Singers, Donald Plott,
received a longer standing ova-
tion, many of us might not have
made it home in time for
breakfast. It is a clever practice
among some of us to remain in
our seats for twenty or thirty
minutes after a performance,
thus avoiding the deluge of
traffic caused by the mass
exodus. But for those who had
sagely decided to be the last to
leave Ovens Saturday night,
there was a great sense of
frustration, for the rest of the
audience lingered. As the ap-

NCSA students to perform May 16

Daniel McKelway, Nicolette Driehuys, Grace Chun and Craig
Richey, students at the North Carolina — = the Arts, will be
performing May 16 at 8:15 p.m. in Hodson Son ;

Daniel, son of Mr. & Mrs. Alexander McKelway, 1s inte ia
grade at Alexander Junior High School and a “special student, o
Robert Listokin at NCSA. Daniel plays the clarinet. :

Nicolette, daughter of Mr. & Mrs. Leo Driehuys, is a flautist

studying under Philip Danigan.

Grace is a member of the class of ‘81 at Davidson College on
leave for the school year 79-80. She is a piano student of Joseph

Kalichstein at NCSA.

Craig Richey is the son of the

late David Richey, former

Professor of Music, and Elaine Richey formerly from Davidson. He
is a piano student of Juseph Kalichstein.

Chamber Choir will perform this
Friday in their second public
performance this year.

Don Plott, Dana Professor of
Music, and Mark Shelley, sen-
ior music major, have directed

‘this year’s choir. Approximate-

ly sixteen Davidson students
are involved.

Candy Hawks, a junior who .
sang with the ‘‘parent” group,

the Madrigal Singers, feels that
the Chamber Choir is “neces-
sary—it’s the only place where
men and women get to sing
together.”

Sophomore Martha Anne
Whitmore is a member for the
same reason. ‘‘I enjoy singing,
especially with a group,’ she
said. “‘This is my only chance to
perform with a mixed group.”

Freshman Bill Barrett says
he ‘‘really enjoys the perfor-
ming aspects of the choir.”

Many of the members per-
formed in high school choruses,
so the group is able to sing
sophisticated songs.

Friday's performance will in-
clude several madrigals from
the Renaissance period. The
group will sing two Randall
Thompson pieces: ‘‘Say Ye to
the Righteous” and ‘The Paper
Reeds by the Brook.” A Bach
Chorale, two motets and vari-
ous other selections form the
remainder of the program. -

The performance is at 8:15 in

plause continuéd, my friends
and I finally took the initiative
to make an exit.

The Singers’ performance of
Mozart’s Grand Mass in C
Minor was superb. Carole Bo-
gard (soprano), Brenda Boozer
(mezza soprano), Walter Car-
ringer (tenor), and Bruce
Schoonmaker (bass), the guest
soloists, were high caliber. Boo-
zer was especially fine; said
Mrs. Leo Driehuys of her, ‘“‘She
is one of the best I’ve heard—an
excellent and intuitive musi-
cian.”” Dr. James Swisher said
of the concert, ‘‘Donald Plott’s
direction was sensitive; he made
the halls ring (which is no easy
feat in Ovens), showing Plott’s
understanding for the acoustics
of the auditorium and his own
fine sense of timing.’”” Members
of the audience remarked that
never had they heard the Sing-
ers and the orchestra perform so
well.

Each section of the choral
ensemble had a-distinct sound
which blended to create a
quality that perhaps exceeded
the individual potential. of each
singer. Plott’s control of the
orchestra was masterful. The
combined effect of the instru-
mentalists was not strained or
overbearing. Balance between
the Singers and musicians was
maintained throughout the eve-
ning, an accomplishment that is
remarkable in itself, for simul-
taneously directing both groups
is similar to being the captain of
two ships. It, wouldn’t be sur-
prising for a conductor to
devote too much attention to
one assemblage and then find
that the other has wandered off
course. : ;

It is evident that Mozart had
his Mass in C Minor, but he ne-
ver forgot expression. By the
time the composer wrote the
Grand Mass in 1783, he was
following his own style. He
seems less concerned with the
music found in the Motu Pro-
prio of Pope Pius X. The:Catho-
lic quality of this work lies in its
appeal to the heart. During the

voked during the Kyrie and
parts of the Credo (when the
chorus proclaimed, “I believe.in
one God, ‘the Father Almighty
..-»” I wouldn’t have doubted .
the sincerity of the text even if
I’d been told that I were
listening to 155 atheists.) -
The Grand Mass ended as it
had begun, in the minor key..As .
the final note in the Agnus Dei
faded out, the audience’s emo-
tions shifted back to solemnity.
In the Mass, the appeal to the
heart. is that of supplication.
The mass begins with ‘Lord
have mercy upon us.” It makes
a full circle, ending with, “Have
mercy upon us, grant us
peace."’ The appeal is strikingly
different from the demanding
tone found in Mozart’s glorious
Coronation Mass, and it is an
appeal which makes his Grand
Mass unique.
The Oratorio Singers are not
the marble choir boys of Dona-
tello; they had their moments of
weakness. In the Credo section, .
after the Crucifixus, the so-
pranos were late with the Res-
urrexit—a slight flaw which
was explained away by Dr.
Wilmer Welsh, who commen-
ted, ‘Easter must have been a

little late the year Mozart com-

posed the piece.” Bogard was
accused of being shrill at times.
However, .the reason for this
may be that many of us were
not accustomed to hearing any-
one hit a high C.

When Mozart was commis-
sioned to write a Mass, he

’ protested, claiming that he was

only made for the opera. But at
the offer of 100 louis d'or for a
Mass, he smiled and said that
he would one day use parts of

stamp of genius in the world
with his choral-orchestral com-
positions. This genius was
made manifest last Saturday —
night. The audience was left
with a profound respect for the
performers and a greater awe of
Mozart. As I walked from the
auditorium, I felt as Kierke-
gaard must have felt. when he
said, “Immortal Mozart...to
