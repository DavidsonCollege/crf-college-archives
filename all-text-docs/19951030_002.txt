Bookstore work-study
students take initiative

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Assistant News Editor

Students get mad at the book-
store each semester for escalating
book prices. Professors dislike the
bookstore nagging them too early
for next semester’s book orders.

Yet many professors didn’t
understand that their timeliness
helps the bookstore stock the
shelves on time, and keep book
prices lower. Matthew Hobbie, a
sophomore employee at the book-
store, told professors what they
could do to help students receive
and afford books.

Hobbie. sent out a letter on
October 11 to every faculty mem-
ber that described how they af-
fected the processes of ordering
and pricing books.

This semester, the bookstore
witnessed a 70 percent increase
over last year of professors turning
their book orders in by the dead-
line. Well over half of them re-
quested next semester’s books by
the October 20 deadline.

In Hobbie’s letter, he detailed
how the prompt or tardy return of
a professor’s book orders deter-
mines if a book arrives on time for
classes, the buy-back value of the
book, and how many used books
the bookstore receives.

Availability: As Hobbie ex-
plains, the sooner a professor turns
in his or her book order, the more
time bookstore employees have to
research and obtain books. More
time is also needed to obtain books
from overseas.

Buy-Back Value: Many stu-
dents wonder why they receive so
little money when they sell back
their books. Hobbie also explains
that students can sell back their
books for half of their original price
if professors give the bookstore
their orders early. If the book
orders are late, students receive
one-third of the original value of
the book at most.

Used Books: Lastly, Hobbie .

details that wholesalers sell used
books on a first come-first serve
basis. Therefore, earlier book or-
ders increase the chance of receiv-
ing more used books. When a
students buy.used books, they save
25 perceni of the book’s original
value.

Hobbie explains that his letter
targeted “those who wait simply
because it does not seem impor-
tant.”

He explains that some factors
keep professors kept from turning
their requests on time, but many
other professors do not realize the
urgency of their early book selec-

tion.

Some professors admit the let-
ter clarified why the bookstore
asked for requests so early.

Associate Professor of Politi-
cal Science Dr. Brian Shaw says,
“Tt was helpful because it reminds
us why we have to get [the order] in
as early as we do. The insistence of
the bookstore seems arbitrary, but
now we know it’s not arbitrary.
It’s helpful to bookstore employ-
ees, which is important, but stu-
dents are also adversely affected
by professors turning them in late.”

Department Chairman and
Professor of Art Dr. Larry Ligo
stated that though he probably
would have turned his request on
time, he would have waited longer
if he had not read Hobbie’s letter.

. “Human nature being what it is, I

probably would have waited until
the last day; but when I read it and
saw the argument, I did it right
away,” he states.

Hobbie thinks that the excel-
lent response to his letter shows
that professors are concerned about
students. :

Hobbie states thathe was “very
heartened” by the results and is
“just really happy that people did
pay attention to [the letter] and it
shows that they really care about
students.”

The illegal bonfire of Saturday night.

Fire

after the officers asked him three
times to do so. After the third
refusal Officer Ramsey arrested
Matthews, charging him for ob-
structing operations of the fire de-
partment. Ramsey says Matthews
was arrested for “resisting and de-
laying” fire-fighting procedure,
Police handcuffed Matthews
and escorted him downtown to the
Mecklenburg County Intake Cen-
ter of Charlotte. According to
Matthews, he hadn't said anything
tothe police but thathe was "singled
out." Matthews, only the second
Davidson student to get arrested
by campus police, spent five hours
in jail, leaving at seven a.m. after
friends got together the $250 bond.
According to Ramsey,
Matthews later admitted he was
acting disobediently. Ramsey says,
“He just had a little too much to
drink.” Matthews, however, says
he was not drunk at the time.
Says Matthews, "I think the
situation was blown out of propor-
tion."
Campus police also gave out

two alcohol violations to students
Saturday night as a result of
drunken behavior during the fire
fiasco.

Though campus police have
already received complaints about
how things were handled Saturday
night, Officer Ramsey says he
would take the same actions again.
He says, “There were probably oth-
ers who needed to be arrested,”
and realizes that “everyone has a
different opinion about what hap-’
pened last night.”

According to SGA President
Bill Gullan, Matthews just wanted
to know why. Disappointed with
the actions taken by campus police
in arresting a Davidson student
and with putting out the fire, Gullan
says: “It’s not often that something
spontaneous happens around here,
and it is certainly not often that
students have such a bonding ex-
perience. Unfortunately, in this
instance, all that was positive and
harmless about .the bonfire was
hosed down by campus police and
the fire department along with the
fire itself.”

Campus police, including Po-
lice Chief Rick Moore, reviewed
the situation and compiled an offi-
cial police report this morning.
