WE THANK YOU, ALUMNI!

Old men, Davidson is grateful for your
constant support in the football season
just ended. The team, the squad and
the whole student body thank you. You
only did your duty, and what’ you want-
ed to do—for you are still a part of us—
but not everyone does as much. ‘

The team heard your voices at the
opening game of the season in Raleigh,
and it helped them. They knew you
were behind them at Lexington and At-
lanta. In both the games in Charlotte
the number of usual followers of the
team was nearly doubled because of your
again wearing the red and black as you
used to do. From the time the whistle
blew at the beginning of the game on
Prince Albert Park, in Winston-Salem,
until after the snake dance at the Zin-
zendorf, D. C. felt your presence. And
many of the students’ hearts rejoiced
when your voices of support were heard
amidst that great crowd of strangers in
Greenville.on Thanksgiving Day.

Maybe our season hasn’t been as suc-
cessful from the standpoint of the num-
ber of games won and lost as some while
you were here. But men, never has a

bunch of harder fighting fellows been
on Sprunt Field nor fellows with better
spirit: This is not only to thank you
for remaining behind us in the season
of 1920; but to let you know that David-

FORMER DAVIDSON FOOT-

BALL STAR MARRIED| He

Mise Helen Barnhart is the Attrac-
tive Bride of Jack Black, ‘20.

At § o’clock on the evening of Novem-
ber 24, J. M. Black, ‘20, better known to
all Davidson men and to the world of
football enthusiasts as Jack Black, was
married to Miss Helen Barnhardt at the
home of her sister, Mrs. W. H. David-
son, of Charlotte. The ceremony was
performed by the Rev. A. W. Plyler, of
Greensboro, brother-in-law to the bride.
After a short visit in Asheville, Mr. and
Mrs. Black will make their home in
Greenville, S. C., where he is engaged
in business with the firm of Mills and
Manning.

Jack had the good fortune of knowing
and loving his bride from childhood
days among the treasure laden hills of
Pioneer Mills, once a prosperous mining
place where other than human gold was
as happily found.

Miss Barnhart is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. J. A. Barnhart of Pioneer Mills,
N. C. She received her college educa-
tion at Flora Macdonald and the State
Normal, completing a successful course
as a trained nurse in Stuart. Circle Hos-
pital, of Richmond, Va.

Jack’s brilliant career as All-Southern
halfback in the days of Davidson's great-
est football fame, his enviable record iw
the A. EL. F. as first lieutenant in the
Eighty-First Field Artillery, his return
to college in the fall of 1919 and the last
game of his foothall career, in which he
was largely responsible for Davidson's
running thru Furman's line for a 41 to 14
victory needs no reiteration to readers
of The Davidsonian. Suffice it to say
that it is hoped that he and Mrs. Black
wilt have many more Thanksgivings such
as this has been for them and that they
may see many more Thanksgiving
games played in Greenville like the one
he played in ‘19.

HIGH AS A LAWYER

Graduating With the Class of °78,
Has Attained Prominence
in Legal Affairs.

Charles McGuffey Hepburn, '78 was
born in Rockbridge County, Virginia, on
August 16, 1858. His parents, Andrew
Dousa and Henrietta (McGuffey) Hep-
burn, put Charles in school when he was
but a small chap; but from the very first
he learned readily and was a leader in
his classes.

He entered Davidson College in 1875
at the age of 17, and graduated here in
1878, being valedictorian of his class.
He was a leader in other phases of col-
lege activities than scholarship while at
Davidson, however. In 1880, two years
after his graduation from college, he re-
ceived the degree of LL.B. from the
University of Virginia; and in 1908 the
University of Miami conferred the de-
gree of LL.D. upon Dr. Hepburn.

Dr. Hepburn was married on October
10, 1891, to Miss Julia Benedict, of Mari-
etta, Ga. He became tutor in charge of
the preparatory department at Davidson
in 1880, and remained in that capacity for
two years. He was admitted to the
Ohio bar in 1881 and practiced at Cin-
cinnati until 1883. He was lecturer on
Code and Common Law, pleading in the
Cincinnati Law School from 1897 until
1903.

In 1903 Dr. Hepburn became Professor
of Law in the University of Indiana. In
1909 he organized the Amherst Institu-
tion of Law, for the purpose of estab-
lishing post-admission-to-the-bar courses
of legal study. He has been secretary
of a section of legal education in the
American Bar Association since 1901,
and was a delegate to the Sound Moncey
Convention in Indianapolis in 1896.

He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa,
Phi Delta Phi, and Beta Theta Pi fra-
ternities. He is a Presbyterian and a
Democrat. In 1897 he wrote “Historical
Developments of Code Pleading in
America and England;” and in 1913
“Cases on Torts.” His home address at
present is Bloomington, Ind.

Davidson is watching with great in-
terest and pride the achievements of Dr.
Hepburn. Only a few of the many facts
in connection with this great character
are mentioned here, but enough are
given to make us admire an alumnus of
Davidson of the class of ‘78—Charles
McGuffey Hepburn.
