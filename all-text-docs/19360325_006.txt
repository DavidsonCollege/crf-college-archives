the bar of the United States Su-

Because the check hadn't been

the court’s record in the case.
Four letters of inquiry were sent
to the professor; he answered
none of them. Finally he was
threatened with disbarment, and

Did you ever
notice the difference
in the aroma of

Chesterfield tobacco?

Every person who knows about
tobacco will understand this...

for to get a pleasing aroma is just
like getting a pleasing taste from

fruit.

Mild ripe tobaccos, home-
grown, and welded with the right
kind of tobacco from far-off

Greece and Turkey

(Samsoun,

Smyrna, Xanthi and Cavalla)...

» 2. that’s why Chesterfield

has a more pleasing aroma.
