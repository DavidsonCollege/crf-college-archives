Thus you cannot learn too early that tra-
ditions and beliefs here are, more than an
intangible subject—they are real things
that we come in contact with everyday.
It is a part of Davidson’s tradition that we
exhibit friendliness, assume responsibility,
have a willingness to work hard, and have
the proper respect for authority. Our little
bit of advice is to strive toward these things.

While it is most too early to start bring-

that should-be made, we cannot help but
offer a plan suggested to us by a larger
University of the south. Freshmen are
new here. @@hey are forming habits each
day, some good, some bad. Some of them
know how and whén to study. Some of
them don’t. Here is where we come in.

A “big brother” plan has been installed by
a large southern institution. Each year a
group of upperclassmen, numbering the
same as the’entering frosh group, are se-
lected by the dean. and YMCA to act as
“big brothers” to incoming freshmen. They
act as advisors, help freshmen get estab-
lished into routines, teach them the im-
portance of study. They are not responsi-
ble for any failures or misunderstandings
of the men they “advise” but their service
invaisable. ;

Why no? instigate such a plan here.

many will agree, some of these unfortunate
