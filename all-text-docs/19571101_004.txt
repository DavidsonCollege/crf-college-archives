The 175 to 200 cases which swamped the infirmary | —

Wednesday a week ago marked the peak of the flu epi-
demic. Although no accurate statistics have been com-
piled, there were probably well over 300 students sick.

Of Wednesday's mob, 36 were
sent home, 55 back to con-
valesce in their rooms. and
many admitted to infirmary
beds. What happened to the
rest is conjectural.

The Guest House and the
president's house were opened
to accomodate the overflow and
to give beds to some of the
students sent back to their
rooms with a fever.

At no time were men with a
fever of over 101 degrees sent
to the dorms, and many of the
lesser cases were later admit-
ted.

INCREASED STAFF
The infirmary added to its

and going to the P.O. for those
confined.

Mrs. Pietenpol rounded up a
battery of toasters to speed up
breakfast deliveries, and Mrs.
Scott provided a TV set for one
of the wards.

When in Madison. Wisconsin,

Tetons, at the latter spot they |
spent five days as the Doctor.

of the peak of the Grand Teton.

They continued to Glacier Na-

Dr. Love is chaffman of the.
Board of Burlington Industries.
Inc.. a member of the Execu-

of Davidson College and also a
‘member of the Board of|
Visitors.

In an interview earlier this;
week, Dr. Cunningham empha-
sized the tireless service of Dr
Love, especially as Chairman of
the Development Committec!
|which raised 2.5 million dol-
lars for the college several years
» ago.
| Mr. E. H. Little, for whom the
new dormitory is named, is
chairman of the Board and pres-
ident of the Colgate-Palmolive
Company. He is also a membe
of the Board of Visitors. The
decision to name the dormitory
for him was made last May, ac-
cording to Dr. Cunningham.

The decision to rename West
dormitory in honor of Mr. Can-
non was also made last spring.
Mr, Cannon served as vice-pres-
ident of the Trustees of David-
son College from 1936 until his
death in 1952.

For fifteen years he was
chairman of the Building and
Grounds Committee of the
Board of Trustees. This com-
mittee supervised a major por-
tion of Dr. Cunningham's phy-
sical development program of
the college.

When interviewed by tele-
phone, Dr. Cunningham related
that the improvement of hous-
ing has been a long range plan
which began several years be-!
fore the construction of Belk
dormitory.

The erection of Little Hall
was envisioned many years ago,
while the. innovations in other
dormitories have been of more!
recent thought and _ develop-:
ment. \

According to Mr. Grier Mar-

Peter Stuart Nev was not Mar-
shal: Ney of France died on
September 6. 1957.

Mr. Hoyt had severai_ times
visited Davidson College to ob-

, tive Committee of the Trustees/ tain material for his book. Since

Peter S. Ney designed the seal

and motto of Davidson College |:

in 1840. his identity has always
been a matter of considerable
local interest.

No word has been received as
to whether or not Mr. Hoyt’s
manuscript‘ was far enough
along for publication. He was
also the author of a volume en-
titled The Mecklenburg Decla-
ration of Independence pub-
lished in 1907 in which he ar-
gued that the citizens of Meck-

lenburg did not declare their] -

independence of Great Britain
on May 20. 17785.

tion plan which has cost in ex-
cess of $100,000. The cost of
E. H. Little Hall was $235,000
which was, as he termed it, “a
real bargain at a cost of ap-
proximately $2500 per student
housed there.”

Dr. Cunningham said that the
possibility of his returning for
this occasion had been dis-
cussed before he left Davidson.
but the official invitation had
only been extended in the past
several weeks.

He expressed visible delight
at the opportunity to visit the
eampus for this significant oc-
casion, noting that it felt espe-
cially good to be present as a
“consultant with no weight of
responsibility bearing upon me.”

This last statement was made
in reference to his invitation
to meet with the Board of
Visitors in session this week-
end. This board. also a project
of the president emeritus, is
composed of prominent leaders
in business, public affairs, edu-
cation and church life.
