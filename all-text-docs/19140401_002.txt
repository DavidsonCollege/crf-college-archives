PRESIDENT MARTIN.

(Concluded from Page t.)
Counters With kducational kexperts
While in Washington, President

Martin also visited Dr. Claxton, United
States Commissioner of Education, and
together with Dr. Babcock. former Ex-
pert in Higher Education, who, for-
tunately, was found to be in the build-
ing at the same time that President
Martin was there, had quite a lengthy
informal conference on college matters
4n general. It was learned that no
official list grading of colleges has yet
been published, one having been started
and tentatively published, but held up
for some unknown reason by former
President ‘Taft.

Both Dr. Claxton and Dr, Babcock
spoke very highly of Davidson, and
showed clearly the esteem in which the
College is held in the higher educational
circles. Ptesident Martin left this con-
ference well satisfied with the work of
Davidson and re-assured that progress
is being made along sane lines.

After leaving Washington, President
Martin spent some time in New York
and Princeton before returning to Dav-
idson.

President. of his class in Union Semi~

news as it is in the: line of the excctlent
record imtdé by Mr. Golden while at

dent ot the Y. M. C. A.

The EF nglish Press
Wilson as “the ereatest statesman. of
the age.” “Thi announcement. is foi-
lowing his recent speech before Con-
gress. Perhaps it is well to remember
that the first training received by Pres-
ident Wilson in the development of his
wonderful oratorical abilitv. was when
he took such an active part in the work
of the Kumenean Literary Society here |
at Davidson.

State Y. M. C. A. Secretary, will pre-
sent his interesting and instructive
fereopticon views of the Blue Ridge Y

hearing him.

Dr. Vines, of Charlotte. addressed
the Y. M. C. A. March 29, choosing
as his subject, “Habit.” Dr. Vines di-

vided his discussion into three divisions
—The Power of Habit, “The —Perma-
nence of Habit, and the Possibilities of
Habit, treating cach+ phase ins an in-
tensely interesting way.
men enjoved such a wealth of illustra-
tions so tluminating and so applicable
to the point in hand.

made this vear in the method of select-
ing Y. M. C. A. officers for the coming
year. Heretofore the new officers .have
heen elected at the last meeting of the
year, but this vear the officers for nex:

COMMENCEMENT GERALIN
PLANNED.

Held In Selwevn Tlotel.

Following the custom of previous
vears, plans are being discussed for the
annal German to be held in Charlotte
at the Selwyn Hotel on the evening of
the 20th of May.

Although this ig one of the biggest
events of the season, a recent call meet-
ing of the German Club was only slight-
Iv attended. However, _ preliminary
matters were discussed and it was de-
cided to place the scheme before the
student body. Consequently a meeting
was called after chapel last Tuesday
morning. Here the attention of the
students was called to the fact that the
20th of Mav will be a big dav in Char-

To Be

Hlette, thus giving a favorable opportun-

ity to make this one of the best dance:
ever held. since everyone should want
to remain for that dav anvhow. A com-
mittee on arrangements was appointed,
and a business manager clected. These
men will soon be around to collect the
necessary guarantee which will be need

sed before the “hall can be secured and

before further preparations can proceed.
If everybody will sign up we can make
this one of the biggest and best dances
ever pulled off by a Davidson student
ody.
