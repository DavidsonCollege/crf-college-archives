Wildcats aim for conference title

By Will Cobb

After enjoying one of the
school’s most successful seasons
in school history, the men’s bas-
ketball team looks for an even more
productive season. For the first time
in almost ten years, the Wildcats
are favored in preseason polls to
win the Southern Conference. Af-
ter enjoying a 22-8 season and
coming one shot away from the

‘ NCAA Tournament last March,

the players made an unconditional
commitment to improve on those
accomplishments.

“One constant has been to
improve upon already successful
skills. There’s atendancy to rest on
your morals with success. This was
the most productive off-season our
players have had in accordance
with player development,” says

' Head Coach Bob McKillop.

In addition to the hard work
by returning players, McKillop and
his staff have brought in a strong
group of newcomers that should
fill voids from last year’s squad.
This new crop of talent adds a great
deal of athleticism and strength to
the team and should fit into the
system nicely.

“We'll be a very similar team
in style, but we will be able to
generate more points from our de-
fense with amore athletic, quicker,
and stronger group of players. From
a physical aspect, we have clearly
improved,” says McKillop.

The Wildcats return four start-
ers and five of the team’s top scor-
ers. Although the lost starter was

the team’s leading scorer and emo-
tional leader Janko Narat, the ab-
sence should be more than
compenstated with captains Bran-
don “Ozone” Williams, George
“Biscuit” Spain, and Chris “Cat”
Alpert. Junior Jeff Anderson will
keep the starting position he earned
at the midle of last season while
Quinn Harwood will step in as as
the starting power forward after
playing a key reserve role last sea-
son. :

Junior co-captain Chris Alpert

Look for Davidson to rely on
production off the bench once
again, with talented reserves at
every position. Junior Mark
McGuire, the team’s tallest player
at 6-10, has continued to improve
his game and should see consider-
able time off the bench. With the
incorporporation of the new talent,
look for the Wildcats to consis-
tently go nine to ten players deep

- George Spain 6-8 Sr.: One of two
seniors on the squad, Spain started
last season at the forward position.
He averaged 10.1 points a game
last season and at one point led the
nation in field goal percentage end-
ing the season with a .643 average.
His consistency has carried all three
years while maintaining a career
59 percent field goal average. In
the preseason conference polls,
Spain was ranked the third best
rebounder and made the list of best
defensive players. “After a most
productive off-season along with
his commitment to becoming a
better player, George could be one
of the most efficient low post scor-
ers in the conference as well as the
country,” says Coach McKillop.
Tim Caldwell 6-8 Sr.: After play-
ing three seasons, Caldwell joined
the team late this season and began
practicing November 13. Although
he has a lot of lost time to make up
for, Caldwell is expected to fill in

and give temporary relief at the —

forward position. “Tim knows how
to play and can adapt to any role
the team needs” says McKillop.

Mark McGuire 6-10 Jr.: Playing
in 27 games last season, McGuire
contributed some excellent min-
utes off the bench. He averaged
3.4 points a game and 2.3 rebounds

last year. Coming on strong late in
the season, McGuire made key
plays that advanced the team in the
Southern Conference tournament.
“Mark hada very productive off
season,” says McKillop. “He has

Senior co-captain George Spain

shown flashes of brilliance and is
now working to convert potential
into production.”

Quinn Harwood 6-9 Jr.: Starting
one game at center last season and
playing in all 30 outings, Harwood

is one of the conference’s most °
versatile players. A perimeter as
well as interior shooter, Harwood
is also a capable ball handler. He
averaged double figures in
Davidson’s last ten games scoring
19 points on five three-pointers in
their 71-64 win over UNCC. He
ended the season averaging 7.9
points and 4.8 rebounds per game.
In preseason conference polls
Harwood was listed third as best
off the bench and also made the
best rebounder list. “Quinn grows
leaps and bounds each year. He is
a Renaissance player that will be
the surprise of the conference this
year,” says McKillop.
Jeff Anderson 6-4 Jr.: Anderson
is considered the team’s defensive
specialist. He started in 16 and
played in all 30 of last season’s
games. He averaged five points
and 2.1 rebounds per game. Ander-
son made the conference best de-
fensive player list. Although he’s _
not recognized for his shooting
ability, Anderson has worked hard ~
in the off season to further develop
his shot. McKillop says Anderson
is “‘adefensive stopper. The league
will have to respect his shooting
ability due to his improvement.”
Brandon Williams 6-6 Jr.: After
averaging 14.4 points and 6.3 re-
bounds as a sophomore, Williams

is acandidate for conference player
of the year. Williams graced al-
most every column of the confer-
ence preseason bests. He ranked
especially high as Best All-Around
Player and Best Pro Prospect. His
career high came with 30 points in
the tournament win over Western
Carolina, but Williams also con-
tributed 28 points on five three-
pointers in Davidson’s win over
N.C. State. “Brandon is on a mis-
sion. He will be the go-to guy this
season,” says McKillop.

Chris Alpert 5-11 Jr.: Alpert re-
turns for his third season as a starter
ending the season averaging 8.1

’ points and racking up 130 assists.

In two seasons he is already eighth
incareer leading assists at Davidson
and is ranked second best ball-
handler inconference polls. Alpert
initiated the attack last season and
won two games for the Cats on last
second shots. “Chris is the quar-
terback of this team and he sets the

tone on offense and defence. He

must continue to make everyone
better,” says McKillop.

Eugene Jung 6-3 So.: A walk-on
this season, Jung has played bas-
ketball ever since he arrived at
Davidson. Jung provides solid post
play. “He’s strong, aggressive,
