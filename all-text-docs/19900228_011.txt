Wildcats win at UCF

Close loses still plague team in Citadel, Liberty games

By BRUCE BALESTIER

The Wildcats entered their
February 22 matchup with the
Citadel at Belk Arena with the
memory of Bulldog Patrick
Elmore’s 36-point, 20-rebound
explosion against them rela-
tively freshin their minds. And
they did a fine defensive job on
him, limiting him to a mere 11
points, only 1 in the second
half. Davidson overcame 37
percent first half field goal
shooting with choking man to
man defense and trailed at the
half by just seven, 35-28.

The Bulldogs extended the
lead to 12 at 46-34 and to 13 on
a dunk by Robert Dalley to
make it 63-50 with 8:59 remain-
ing. Dalley then began a pro-
cession to the free throw stripe
which would help him finish

Citadel last Thursday.

Senior A.J. Morgan grits his teeth and takes it up for two against the

with 20 points to lead the Cita-
del. His tap-in gave his teaman
18-point lead, their largest,
with 4:30 to play.

But the ‘Cats refused to be
blown out; some of Alan
Hunter’s 29 points kept the
deficit near ten before
Davidson resorted to the foul
to stop the clock.

The Citadel responded by
putting the game out of reachat
the foul line. Even so, the last
few minutes were not without
pleasant moments for the
Wildcats. Senior guard A.J.
Morgan was fouled while
making a fast break layup, and
converted the foul shot for a
three point play. A tap-in by
senior Jeff Harris and Paul
Rybiski’s jumper provided the
final, 85-76 margin of defeat.

Hunter's 29 points were the
most by a Wildcat this season;
Detlef Musch and Paul
Denmond. both added 12
points to the Davidson attack.

The ‘Cats entered last Satur-
day night’s contest at Central
Florida with a 2-23 record,
witha troubling 17-game road
losing streak hanging over
their heads. They also hoped to
attain their first win of the year
against a Division I opponent
and toavengea previous53-51
loss to the Knights which in-
volved a second half Wildcat
collapse.

Coach Bob McKillop em-
ployed an all-senior lineup to
start the game, and that lineup
left the gate quickly and
helped Davidson assume a 38-
26 halftime lead. The good
play continued after the inter-
mission, and the ‘Cats led 64-
50 with just 7:09 remaining.
Central Florida drew to within
three at 71-68, but Davidson
sealed the victory with six
straight points, and cruised to
an 83-74 win.

‘The triumph seemed to
mark a catharsis for the Wild-
cats. Previously plagued in
narrow lossesby aninability to
hold a late lead or convert

important ‘free ‘throws, they :

did both against UCF.
They stemmed the Knights’
late rally and hit 21-25 foul

shots on the evening, making |

McKillop understandably
pleased: “I think that showed
our aggressiveness with the
ball, and we didn’t have any
key turnovers.”

Senior point guard Hunter
again led the ‘Cats, this time
with 20 points, and Darry

_ Strickland and Denmond both

contributed 13 markers.

McKillop, who “was

pleased with the effort and

On the Sports Front

Does Davidson
have any athletic
supporters?

By BRUCE BALESTIER

Davidson basketball hit its
season nadir last night, not
because they lost to Liberty,
though they did, but because
of the excessively meager
crowd that exhorted them.
The people who set up Belk
Arena gambled when they
decided not to even pull out
the bleachers for the game,
but that gamble came
through likea sure thing. The
small throng of students in
attendance did not even
come close to filling the
lower level red seats, not
even..when augmented by
Liberty fans (God was at the
game) and various and sun-
dry vagrants. A small group
of students in the front-row,
as usual, cheered enthusias-
tically. But how much noise
can ten people make?

You don’t feel guilty,
though. You had to study.
But there isn’t a quieter place
on campus in which to study
than Belk Arena during a
home basketball game. This
presents the opportunity to
kill two birds with one stone;
be a scholar and an athletic
supporter (so to speak) at the
same time. You stilldon’t feel
guilty. You used tobea rabid

fan back when the ‘Cats were"

a Southern Conference
power. That makes you,
what, a fair-weather fan?
Evidently, you’re more com-
fortable with that label than!
am.

Davidson fans are pathetic.

I know you’re hankering
for a chance at redemption,
though. One home game re-
mains, Saturday at 7:30
againstSt. Josephs of Maine,
and the five senior Wildcats
will be honored before the
game. How about gracing
them with your presence?

The cheerleaders weren’t
at the Liberty game, but the
Providence Day School
Chargettes provided
halftime entertainment,
leading to speculation that
president John Kuykendall
has executed an even up
trade to obtain the services
of the high school honeys.

Signs were hung at the
basketball game Thursday
against the Citadel pro-
claiming such slogans as
“Divest Now.” It is my feel-
ing that such signs, regard-
less of their political orienta-
tion, are out of place, and
that politics and sports,
much like church and state,
should not mix. This is why
politically-based boycotts,
like those of the 1980 and
1984 Olympic Games, are a
bad idea.
