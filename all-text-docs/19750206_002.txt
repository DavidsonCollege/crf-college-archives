Gonzalaz Surveys Education

By VAN WILLIAMSON
Asst. Feature Editor

Catherine Gonzalaz,
professor of Church History at
Columbia Seminary, was the
featured speaker at Tuesday
night’s Vesper Service and also
visited several religion classess
Wednesday.

Gonzalaz studied at Beaver
College in Pennsylvania before
attending seminary at Boston
University. Originally a Home
Economics major, Gonzalaz
soon realized that her interests
lay in her electives (Greek,
Logic, History...), and so
changed her major to Political
Science. After contemplating
law school, she decided to enter
seminary as one of 40 women.in
a class of 300.

This transition from an all-
women college to a
predominantly male-oriented
institution was quite a “cultural
shock’’.

Gonzalaz stands very much in
favor of all-women colleges.
‘There has definitely been a
higher percentage of women
who go on to graduate school
from women’s colleges,’ she

‘““At women’s colleges,
women students receive more
help, that extra push and en-
couragement a student some-
times needs to help inspire
her; professors HAVE to take
women seriously, because they
are the only students. At co-ed
schools, it’s the male students
who are often given that extra
push, rather than women.”’

She expressed some regret
that Beaver College recently
became coed. “A women’s
college provides women with
many models to emulate,
because there are a greater
number of women professors
and faculty. e

When asked about what she
felt the future of a ‘good’
liberal arts education to be,
Gonzalaz proposed a “revam-
ping of the understanding of
women and where they’ve been
in history. This needs to happen
in almost every field, as it has
in seminaries.’

Gonzalaz did not, however,
favor ‘women’s courses”’ as the
solution to a better un-
derstanding of women. “They
can too often and too easily
become a ‘haven’ for women to
‘get their bearings: and then go
back to the main stream. We
need a revamping of all courses
so that they will become ‘nor-
mal’ and ‘main stream’, not
just an elective subject.”

Gonzalaz is also a scholar of
Biblical History, with a special
interest in the Apostle Paul,
who has often been maligned
for ‘‘chauvinistic’’ statements
about women’s role in the
Church. She believes, however,
that Paul is ‘‘better than his

press coverage makes him.
“Paul deserves aT e-
examination,’ explain n-

zalaz. ‘‘Much of the cause for
disagreement is actually based
on textual difficulties.’’ She
prefers to examine Paul in light
of his statements on freedom in
the Book of Galations.

This agrees with Gonzalaz’s
position on Christianity and
human freedom and dignity,
and the idea that what everyone
needs is a “new sensitivity
towards a great many things.”’

Students Consider Responsibility

Tabloid To Include

New Clas

By JOHN WOOD
Staff Writer
A list entitled ‘‘Comparative
Literature and Literature in

. Translation’’ will be included in

the new courses of instrucction
tabloid this spring, according to
Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan.

The Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC) defeated a
similar proposal to include a
comparative literature section
in the 1975-76 college catalog.at
their Jan. 20 meeting.

“T don’t want to expand the
catalog,” said Bevan. He cited
reasons of cost as the major
deterrent for such an addition.

‘However, we can include
this list in the tabloid, and we’ll
make it conspicuous,’’ Bevan
said.

“Fam satisfied with this com-
promise,’ said Professor of
English J. Gill Holland, one of
the supporters of the proposal to
the EPC. ‘I want these courses
to be visible,’’ Holland said.

The courses now being con-
sidered include three from the
Classics department, Greek
Views of Man, Greek Drama in
Translation, and Greek
Mythology in Art and

sifications

Literature.

Also mentioned in the tabloid
will be Non-Chaucerian
Medieval Literature, Chinese
Poetry ig Translation, Scan-
dinavian Literature in Tran-
slation, Latin American
Literature in Translation, and
Twentieth Century German
Literature in Translation. ,

‘Most people don’t know the
definition of comparative
literature,” said Holland. He in-
dicated that comparative
literature involves study of
literature and the arts,
literature in translation, and
literatures in the original
languages.

Comparative literature can
be pursued as a major only at
the Center for Honors Studies,
according to Holland.

Bevan did not feel that the
lack of a comparative literature
major in the regular college |
éurriculum necessarily hurt
students’ chances for entrance .
in graduate school in com-
parative literature courses.

“Comparative _ literature
graduate students are not
necessarily . comparative
literature majors in un-
dergraduate schools,” Bevan
said.

College Kills Project Housing Program

By BOB MILKS
Staff Writer

There has been for the past
several years an official college
“program house” policy which
turned Grey House and North
Main House into student
residences based on group
programs. The college is now
ending this attempt at residen-
ce programs and the two houses

will in the future be assigned to

interested groups on the basis of *

the regular room lottery.

Grey House has contained
larger groups and has been the
center for more serious efforts
at a program residence. The
house itself is ore of the older
houses in Davidson and was for
years a faculty home.

The Grey House project this
year is a study of the com-

mitment of the college to the
community. The present group
has been interested in deter-
mining whether or not the
college has any responsibilities
towards the Davidson com-
munity and, if so, defining the
nature and extent of those
responsibilities.

A series of discussions was
held in the fall term on the
project topic, with represen-
tatives present from the
faculty, administration and
community.

These discussions clearly
brought out the point that
Davidson is actually composed
of three distinct components:
the college community,” the
Black community, and the non-
college white community; these
separate groups co-exist in
varying degrees of harmony
(the degree fluctuating between
very little and relatively stable
harmony).

Both of the other two com-
munities are often suspicious of
faculty’ members and students
who announce grand social
schemes, and the Black com-
munity feels that the town has
moved slowly in attracting new
industry to Davidson, building
low-income housing, and
providing social services, The

college itself was rated a good
employer.

The general view, which was
also held by the administration
representatives, was that the
college does have a com-
mitment to the community.
Several of those present said
that there was a tendency to
talk continuously of community
action without much concrete
action actually being taken,
especially by the committees of
the town council.

In the winter term the present
group compiled a survey, from
city tax records, of available
land that could be purchased for
the construction of low-rent
housing. This’ survey was tur-
ned over to the town council
committee concerned with the
question of low-rent housing.

The survey was undertaken in
the hope of advancing beyond
the talk stage to concrete ac-
tion. The group hopes that its
program will provide the im-
petus for further student action
in this areay-such as extended
