excited about the move. “At

team ministry. There is an ec-
umenical movement on the cam-
pus with nearly all denomin-
ations participating. All chap-
Jains will have their offices in, ,
the same building and will all | =
be working together.”

Although somewhat concerned
‘about the race question in Ox-, 6
ford, Morris feels that a more
desirable situation exists there
than in Davidson. ‘After the
riots in 1962, the entire com-
munity, both white and colored,
realized that something had to
be done. They are now doing it.”’

The Rev. J. William Morris,
rector of St. Alban’s Episcopal
Church, will leave Davidson
Nov. 28, to become the Episcopal
chaplain at the University of
Mississippi, he announced this
week.

Morris said that he was very

FOWLIE DISCUSSES MODERN THEATER

IDebating Team Opens
With Loss At Emory

f Beginning their second season
.' under

Coach Ray McMillan.
Davidson's varsity debaters
competed last weekend in
Emory University’s Peachtree

' Invitational Debates, one of the

largest tournaments in the

South.

| The tournament recognized
| senior Greg Haynes as one of
its top 10 speakers. Haynes and
junior Tom Rhodes finished with
a 4-4 record and ninth place in
the point standings.
Sophomores Fletcher Hartsell
and Jim Cooley, entering their
first varsity competition as a
team, could manage only two
wins against six losses.
Rhodes, president of the Da-
vidson Debate Club. remarked

‘“ttoughest competition we have
ever come up against.”

The freshman debaters open-
ed their season with a novice
tournament at Appalachian
State Teachers’ College last
weekend. The affirmative team
of Mac Hobby and Robert Pyeatt
finished with a 4-2 record. Dan-
iel Spencer and Peter Leo, de-
bating negatively, won three
and lost three.

MeMillan indicated that he
was ‘‘pleased with the freshman
enthusiasm."' The novice team
will travel to the University of
Georgia next weekend.

The varsity teams, with Shep
Johnston filling in for Haynes,
will leave Thursday for another
tournament at the University of
South Carolina.

To Be Held

Elections to fill the position
of editor of the 1967-68 Wildcat
Handbook will be held week
after next.

Two juniors, Bruce Weihe and
Bill Schmickle, have already
filed for the position and were
approved as candidates by the
Publications Board Monday af-
ternoon.

Opportunity for other inter-
ested students to file for the
position are remaining open. Ex-
perience on the handbook's staff
is not a necessary qualification
for running.

“The concensus of the board
was that the editorship should
not be limited to staff members,
particularly for this particular
publication, since technical abili-
ty is not as much a requisite
as itis for some of the other
publications,” according to Louis
Lesesne, board chairman.

Students interested in run-
ning for the position should con-
tact the present editor, Alva
Whitehead, in time to have their
names submitted to the board
before its meeting Wednesday.

Price Rise Produces
Activities Budget Hike

Increased costs of printing and
engraving for student publica-
tions have resulted in a rise in
the student activities budget, but
the extra cost will be paid from
the regular college budget in.
stead of by increasing the $25
fee charged students.

According to Robert A. Cur-
rie, college business manager
and treasurer, the total amount
requested added up to $27,291.
This would be $27.41 per student.

However, only $26,175 ‘was al-
located.

This amount is to be divided
between THE DAVIDSONIAN,
The Miscellany, the Wildcat
Handbook, Quips and Cranks,
the Artist Series and the Student
Council.

Morris. originally from Cleve-
land, Ohio, received his BA from
Duke University and attended
the Episcopal Theological Sem-
inary of the Southwest in Austin.
Tex. From there he came to
Davidson where he has been
for the last five and one half
years, ‘

Over this period Morris said
that he has noticed two big
changes in Davidson College.
The first ‘concerns the student
body. “Davidson has become
more sensitive to student pres-
sures. As a result of this, the
student body has become much
more responsible. More is ex-
pected of the students in the
field of college policies, and the
students have responded.”

Connected with this is Mor-
ris’ noticing a certain liberaliza-
tion of the college, “Davidson
has become much less provin-
cial. It is now freer; it has a
more open atmosphere. David-
son is more aware.of the ration
and in turn, the nation is more
aware of Davidson.”

Morris thinks that the main
difference between Davidson and
Mississippi will be the size and
diversity of the student bodies.

The budget shows a $1,500 in-
crease from last year.

Even though all the money
requested could not be granted,
Currie commented that essential-
ly everybody received what they
wanted.

Denied were funds for running
a bus to Charlotte for social and
sports events. Currie said that
the funds were refused, not be-
cause the committee in charge
was unsympathetic, but because
operating the bus should not be
part of the student activity fee.

Currie also said that some-
time in the future the Artist
Series and ‘The Miscellany might
be placed under the general col-
lege budget. as has been done|

Plotting the directions of the new French theater, Dr. Wallace
Fowlie, professor of French at Duke University, spoke in-
formally to students on Monday afternoon. In defining the new
movement, Fowlie sald that the estrangement of characters
from the world is one of the central themes of the new theater.
“The refusal of the characters to carry on coherent dialogue”

Earlier Monday, Fowlie described the works of the major
dramatists of the new theater, principally Eugene lonesco,
Samuel Beckett and Jean Genet, in a lecture during chapel
‘ period. Fowlie elaborated on these authors’ revolt from the
use of accepted staging techniques and the use of the absurd
situations and bizarre props. (Staff Photo by Olson)

Ex-Convict Tells Story
Of Life’s Rehabilitation|

Bill Sands, former convict and
current rehabilitator, challeng
ed the student body in Tuesday's
chapel with his life and message.

Receiving a rare standing ova-
tion from his listeners, Sands
fascinated his audience for a
full 40 minutes and afterwards
at the coffee hour.

The story of his own life and
the death of Caryl Chessman
composed most of the speech.
Although the son of a California
judge and enjoying the comforts
of upper class life, Sands was
sent to reform school at age 17
for armed robbery with an un-
loaded gun.

At 19 he began serving two
life sentences for ‘‘several arm-
ed robberies, running gunfights
with the police; and several as-
saults with intent to kill.”

It took only 30 days in San
Quentin for him te witness his
first prison murder. Not yet
“con-wise,”” he simply stood
there, while 6,000 other convicts,
wise to vendettas of prison life,
turned their backs.

Being questioned about the
identity of the killer, he deliver-
ed his first and last prison quip:
“It was some guy wearing a
grey suit."

Solitary confinement took the
humor out of him. When re.
leased he weighed 145° pounds,
down from 206, had 33 broken
bones, and had lost all his teeth.

Later he participated in a riot
at San Quentin in which 50 con-

National Guard could not quell
the riot, but one man, Clinton T.
Duffey, could. This man, the
new warden, changed the whole
situation for Sands by saying “I
care.”

“I sewed up three life sen-
tences in three years and 47
years of parole in two years,”
Sands stated, expressing grati-
tude for Duffey’s influence.

‘Chessman learned two things
