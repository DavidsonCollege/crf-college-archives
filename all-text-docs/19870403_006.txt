Cats’ baseball continues winning ways

By MATT NEWSOM
The Wildcat baseball team
continued to make progress to-
wards a very successful season as
they picked up victories against
tough non-conference foes Wake
Forest and UNCC last week, sur-
rounding a three-game series at
conference opponent Western

Carolina.
Last Thursday’s game against
Wake Forest was. ‘moved from
Davidson to Winston-Salem due
to the poor field conditions at
Davidson. However, the Demon
Deacons couldn't turn _ their
homefield advantage into a vic-
tory as the Wildcats prevailed in
the slugfest 11-10. Senior first
baseman Mark Thompson went
four for four and homered, while
Alan Lewis hit his seventh round-
tripper of the year. But the big

blow came in the bottom of the cord to 5-1 on the year.

eighth inning as Bill Masse put the
Wildcats on top to stay with a two-

run double. Greg Wilcox pitched
7 1/3 innings to get the win in re-

-lief of Jeff Loser.

On Saturday the Cats traveled
to Cullowhee to play the defend-
ing Southern Conference Champi-
ons, Western Carolina. As has be-
come customary during the past
two years, Steve Condon opened
up the weekend series with a vic-
tory. The Cats’ bats were alive
and kicking as Davidson scored
fourteen runs during the seven-in-
ning contest. Thompson homered
once again, and Dan Simonds
pounded out three hits. Freshman
Steve Livesy had a bases-loaded
double to blow the. game wide
open. Condon ‘gave up only one
run on six hits while raising his re-

Unfortunately, . Davidson's
bats were silenced in game two of

the doubleheader. After Western —

Carolina jumped out to a 1-0 lead,
Dave DePaul hit a solo homer in
the fourth inning to tie the game.
Then in the fifth inning, Ron
Kmacik pinch ran for Mark
Thompson, who had walked to
lead off the inning. While Livesy
attempted to sacrifice bunt, an
overthrow permitted Krnacik to
go to third base. Pinch hitter Rob
Zimmerman then hit a sacrifice fly
for Davidson’s only other score of
the game.

The Catamount pitching was
not kind to Wildcat hitting on Sun-
day either. Davidson drew first
blood in the top of the first when
Brian Moure doubled home Lewis
and Dave Turgeon. However,

ek

’ Billy Waitsman, who had been ill

throughout the weekend surren-
dered seven runs in 2 1/3 innings.
Wilcox relieved Waitsman in the
third and shut down Western
Carolina. BUt the damage had
been done, and DAvidson could
only muster a Mark Thompson
home run en route to a 10-4 de-
feat.

The Wildcats were to have
played Lenoir-Rhyne on Tuesday;
but Mother Nature recorded her
eighth victory of the season by
raining out the regional affair.
Davidson returned to action on
Wednesday when they hosted
crosstown rival UNCC in a home
run derby. The 49ers hit three
round trippers while the Wildcats
connected on five of their own,
Masse, Turgeon, and Moure all
had one apiece, while Alan Lewis

added a pair ‘of blasts over the
right field fence. Condon pitched
the middle. three innings and
picked up his sixth victory of the
season. Turgeon pitched the ninth
inning and notched his second
save on the year.

Davidson was to have played

‘the Tar Heels of UNC yesterday

before heading down ‘to Charles-
ton, SC to play The Citadel in a
Southern Conference series -this
weekend. Next week the Wildcats
play host to Winthrop on Thurs-
day at 2 pm. Then the Paladins of
Furman invade during Spring
Frolics weekend for a double
header on Saturday at noon and a
single game on Sunday at | pm.
During the festivities, bring your
date by the baseball field and
catch the excitement of Wildcat
baseball.

Assistant Coach Baker looks at Davidson basketball

By HAP BRYANT
Despite apparent’ recent up-
heaval in Davidson’s basketball
program, assistant coach Jim
Baker presented a picture of sta-
bility and optimism in an inter-
view Tuesday. Questions have
arisen following an article in The
Charlotte Observer recently as to
Coach Bobby Hussey’s career
plans. Although declining to
make a definite statement about
Hussey’s plans, Baker said that
the situation should stabilize with-
in the next week to ten days.
Coach Hussey ’s name has ari-
sen in connection with job open-
ings at East Carolina, William and
Mary, and Toledo. His popularity
with other schools does not sur-
prise Baker, even though this is
the first year Hussey has been ac-
tively courted by other schools.
~ According to Baker, “What he’s
(Hussey) been able to do here is
. highly respected. by his peers” in
the coaching profession. “Kids
are graduating on time and are
representing the school well.” In
this day of scandal in the
N.C.A.A:>, Baker said, high
graduation rates and other ethical
conduct are rare. Institutions will ,

now examine even harder coaches
like Hussey who have established
positive, sanction-free programs.
In addition, Hussey.’s consecutive
twenty-win seasons have raised
his stock considerabiy. a.

According to Baker, “He’s
(Hussey) still interested in To-
ledo.” However, nothing definite
has been decided. “The job hasn’t
been offered yet.” When asked
whether or not Baker would
accompany Hussey to Toledo if
the job was in fact offered, he re-

» plied, “I don’t know.” He agreed -

that everything regarding the job
there is hypothetical now, reiterat-
ing that the cloud should clear
soon.

However, one member of the

coaching staff will definitely not

return next year. Assistant coach
Sam Dixon, returning to his alma
mater, will assume the. head
coaching job at Denison Univer-
sity in Ohio. Baker wished Dixon
well in his endeavors, saying
“He'll do a nice job. -He’s highly
respected in the Midwest. It’s a
good opportunity for him.” When
Dixon departs, Davidson will lose
a key part of its staff.

Although Baker exuded a

positive outlook, he expressed re-
gret regarding Davidson’s immi-
nent expulsion from the Southern
Conference. He noted that
scheduling, recruting, and fan
support would suffer most from an

_ independent status. ‘‘Our schedul-

ing would be awful. You’d have
your Campbell Universities com-
ing in here once a year. You’d
play Holy Cross once a year.” Ac-
cording to Baker, an independent
status would force Davidson to
schedule DePaul, Notre Dame,
Dayton, and the few other basket-
ball independents, and we would
have slim possibility of ever re-
ceiving anN.C.A.A. Tournament
bid.

4 Secondly, Baker noted that re-
cruiting would suffer as well.
“Kids want to go, or have a chance
to go, to the N.C.A.A.,” a pros-
pect that independent status would
dim. However, as yet, looming
independence has not adversely
affected recruiting, as one promis-
ing recruit, 69” Texan Thomas
Hellen, has already signed.

Thirdly, Baker felt that the
lack of a conference’ would
hamper fan support, as Davidson
could not establish any meaning-

ful, heated rivalries as an indepen-
dent. He noted that occasions like
the Marshall game would be few
and far between without a confer-
ence.

However, although the con-
ference situation for Davidson

,| after next year is still in doubt,
} Baker does not expect indepen-
| dence to continue. “I think Kit
| (Morris) and Coach Hussey are
| committed to a conference.” He

also said that Davidson is likely to

‘| remain in Division I, noting that
| the publicity for Division I teams
| is much greater that that for Divi-
] sion II. When asked about David-
| son’s possible competitiveness in
‘ the Colonial Athletic Association,

which includes teams like Navy,

; Richmond, East Carolina, George

Mason, James Madison, and

4} UNC-Wilmington, Baker said, “I
| think we could do-fine. If the con-
| ference decides ‘to admit David-
_| son, we would enter a conference

with a television package and

- modern gymnasium facilities.”

However, Baker noted that a

league championship, though at-

tainable, would be hard-won.

“The conference, from top to bot- °
tom, is a little better that the

Southern Conference.”

In conclusion, Baker con-
tinued his optimism as he looked
to next year’s team. “Next year’s
team will be interesting. Magic
(Gaines) and Alan (Hunter) will
be ready to play . . . . It depends
on whether Maurice Gray will be
able to step in and fill Ace’
shoes.” In addition to these de-
veloping freshmen, Baker .ex-
pressed confidence that returning
Starters Jay Schmitt, Derek
Rucker, and Jeff Himes will im-
prove over the summer.

Coach Jim Baker, one of: the
men closest to Davidson basket-
ball, anticipates continued suc-
cess. Even though Hussey may
leave, the situation looks promis-

ing for the future of Davidson bas-
ketball. :
