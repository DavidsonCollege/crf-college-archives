DAVIDSONIA

Thursday, November 13, 1941

LET’S GO,

FROSH!

Duke has come and gone. It’s a little late for post mortems,
everything that could be said has been said. Coach McEver
explained that the Wildcats were off, which undoubtedly is

true, and that, the Dukes were well-nigh perfect, which is also

about the truth.

They looked like a big-time bowl team, and they looked
like they could have beat any football tem in the country
last Saturday. “The Duke retinue of spotters, Sports
writers, etc, all agreed that the Devils played their best
game. Before it had been Colgate (they said they were
terrible against Tech) but this past week they were all
there.

Steve Lach, as is the case with all footballers with a big
reputation received his share of criticism, not that he had
done anything exactly wrotlg; he just wasn’t an All-American,
they said, but The Dukes believe that he was, and they still
beat-the publicity drums, he may make it.

The Wildcats have had a hard week of drills. Today
was bloody Monday and there was plenty of knocking of
heads. They carried Scotty Paterson off, but he doesn’t
seem to be seriously hurt. George Marsh is back along
with Herb Rainey, and both may play Saturday. Ac-
cording to Coach Spearman, we'll need both of them. He
predicts a W. & L. victory by four touchdowns, but you
can keep in mind that the coaches, particularly the scouts
make it their business to be pessimistic, and they do a
good job.

As the story is told in other parts of this page, the boys
from Washington and Lee have had their ups and downs, but
they’ve got a good football team, they'll be hard to beat.

As somewhat of a consolation after the 56-0 afternoon,
a-look into the records revéals that although this may be
the worst licking the Wiidcats have taken in recent years,
we've at least beat somebody else worse. In 1921, after a
fairly unsuccessful season the Cats took Wofford in tow
86-0. A glorious afternoon. They even topped Duke’s
totals in first downs with 34 to 27, and in yards gained
in rushing. The Terriers yielded 812, while the Cats gave
some 600 odd to the Blue Devils.

Court Chat

It seems that there’s a tendéney to rush the season .what-
ever the sport is, but the’ basketballers have begun drills.and
deserve a bit of space. They’ve got eight lettermen back
from a rather mediocre squad last year, and Coach Shephards
main difficulty wil be in developing one man to do the scoring
pr rounding two or three who may get hot some night. “Last
year it was all Hogg as.it had been Cowan in the past, and the
Cat offense will have to change their way of playing to suit a
better rounded attack, but one without any definite scoring
threat. This all adds up to the probability that the boys’ll
have to get in shape to play a fast-break; it’s a hard game to
keep up, but from the material that appears available now,
we may be able to shoot the capable subs in there as well as
anyone, and keep things popping with fresh blood. It'll cer-
tainly look good to see a winning Davidson club and basketball
may show just that.

Why?

It seems that Davidson students are forever getting
editorialed at about their behavior, but even if it was a
week ago, it’s a shame the way the gallery behaved toward
the visiting netters. Tennis has been a gentleman’s game,
but the procedure was a little reversed here, it was more
like a Brooklyn baseball game, and it certainly goes a long
way toward knocking Davidson off the top place they
hold in the realm of spirit, etc., the indefinable, vague
things for which the college is famous.

TOUGH GUARDS

George Marsh and B. F. Meore, dependable and hard fighting guards
on this year’s eleven are both expected to be in the thick of the fight
against W. & L. this week. Marsh has missed action since the State
game, but Moore has played consistently good ball all year.

Generals Up and Down

The Generals too, have had their
ups and downs, having been tram-

they hold victories over Richmond
and Sewanee, and a tie with the
potent Gobblers of Virginia Tech.
All in all it wil be a rough after-

noon for McEver’s men.

From end to end the thin Red
Line is not what it should be to
out-charge the hefty Geherals, but
Davidson spirit is usually more
plentiful than Davidson weight, so
play your hunches and don't be
surprised if a Red and Black vic-
tory doesn't headline the Sunday

shects.
