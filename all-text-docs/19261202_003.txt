ALL- SOUTHERN HERE

Jim Pinkney, Hebe end, on the
Davidson Championship team this
year, is the only member of the
Wildcat squad who has received
recognition of his ability asa play-

Ir you've just become wedded to the sweet-

est pipe in the world... (or even if you've
celebrated your silver jubilee) rivet this gem
of wisdom in your old fedora—and don’t
forget it: Any paluka can get a pipe... but
it takes a good man to keep ’er and keep ‘er

happy!

Be kind to your pipe. And remember: no
trouble ever arises between a man and his pipe
once there’s a little Granger in the home
Granger’s so mild —such fine old Burley
tobacco. And the famous “Wellman Method”
makes it so mellow... It puts you on top of
the world—happy and carefree. °

Being rough cut, too, Granger burns so
slow your pipe never gets “all het up.” It,
k@eps/cool and sweet... always! Then
Granger makes it easy to support a pipe. For
packed simply and economically it is most
reasonably priced. In fact, no man need deny
his pipe the joy and comfort of Granger.
