effort to add to the woes of the crippled Davidsons.

LINE-UP RIDDLED WITH INJURIES

Probably no Davidson team in recent years has faced the
prospect of playing a game with so many top-flight men out of
action or at least partially slowed up due to injuries. A run
down of this list should show why Conch Charley’s hair is get-
ting grayer by the minute .. . Richards out with a leg infection
... Sharpe nursing a badly sprained shoulder . . . Mapes side-
lined with a chipped cheek bone. None of these three is expected
to see action.

To this list can be added Reynolds, Carnegie and Eborn
who will be slowed up with charley horses’. . . Runyan whose
baek is still giving him trouble... Turner who has been out for
two weeks .. . Lambeth who returned from St. Louis with
several bruised ribs and a nose injury. Charlie Parker expects
to have all of these rendy for at least part time service today.
but none Will be in top shape.

MUCH DEPENDS ON SOPHOMORES

The job of filling these gaping holes has fallen ou the
shoulders of several battle-proved sophomore, and with so
many second-year men in the line-up today, Davidson backers
may get an idea of what to expect from the local gridders for
the next year or so. Counted on for heavy duty in the line are
Bill McNeely, the Iredell County lad who wasn’t even sure
what a football looked like before entering collere .. . Jim
Fasul, who has already distinguished himself in his first year
of varsity play, and massive Jerry Kiser’ who ¢arries 280 ibs.
on his stocky frame.

Seatback Johnny Guiton is almost certain to show his stuff
against the Spiders. Johnny played during most of the second
half against St. Louis. carrying the ball 12 times and averaging
five yards a try. This tiny speedster has continually looked
good in scrimmages and is probably the best broken field run-
ner on the squad. Ham Wade, another sophomore, has been
moved from defensive halfback to offensive fullback. Against
the Bills from Missouri, Ham posted a healthy 5.5 average
lugging the ball for the best rushing average to date on the
team.

POST-MORTEM OF ST. LOUIS GAME

if their past performances this year mean anything, the
Wildcats should be ‘up” for the Richmond contest despite the
injuries which have riddled the line-up. The comments of stu-
dents and faculty members concerning last week’s thumping
at the hands of the rough Bills have done little to help the
morale of the team. True, Davidson was heaten and beaten
soundly by a team ‘‘that didn’t have nearly what Presbyterian
did,’’ according to one of the members of the coaching staff.
But a squad whose ranks were depleted by injuries-to the extent
of the Davidson team, is bound to have some of the life taken
out of it.

In the first place, Turner and Mapes didn't even make the
trip to St. Louis . . born and Richards didn’t play during
the game . . . Sharpe and Carnegie were forced to leave the
game due to injuries ... and the starting backfield, Rimer,
Sifferd, Lambeth and Runyan were all hurt during the first
half and didn’t play during the last half. At different times
during the second half, eight sophomores were on the defen-
sive eleven and seven sophs took the field on the offensive

' Terriffic Drubbing

By DAN McKEITHEN

Davidson's up and down foot-
ball team found itself down last
Saturday as it received a 41.12
pasting from the St. Louis Billikens
on the victor’s home field.

With a rain-soaked homecoming
gathering looking on, the under
dog St. Louisans-scored after just
four and a half minutes of play on
a 00-yard run. A Wildcat fumble
set up a second score for the Billi.
kens. With the score, 12-0, the
visitors came back with a touch-
down on a Sl-yard pass play from
Auburn Lambeth to Jimmy Sifford.
After Billiken halfback E. Me,
Cluskey broke away for a 66-yard
scoring jaunt, Lambeth returned the
kickoff 85 yards to set the stage
for the second Davidson tally. Full-
back Rhea Adams, subbing for the
injured C, L. Runyan, carried the
pigskin into paydirt. Shortly after
a Lambeth pass was intercepted
and run for a TD. ;

The half saw the score 26-12, and
also saw the last of the Davidson
scoring. The second half scoring
was. accomplished by — fullback
Shackleton’s short plunge, a safety,
and a 77-yard run with an inter-
cepted pass. Minus at least four
first-string men, including lam-
beth, the Wildcats had trouble
moving far. Johniy Guiton ran for
50 yards to the St. Louis 27, but
it was here that the drive bogged
down, Fullback Ham Wade ran
very well and ended up with a
commendable five and a half yard
average per try.

Returning to their section of the
country, the Wildcats plan to play
hard and add a few victories.

Wildkittens Hold
Furman Frosh to Tie

Last Saturday the freshman
team opened its grid season with a
hard-fought duel with the $27,000
Furman freshman squad. The
Wildkittens were outweighed 25
pounds per man in the line and
{5 pounds in the backfield, but
were nevertheless able tc equal
the Hurricanes in first downs and
score,

The South Carolinians were first
to score. In the second quarter Rob-
ertons took the ball en an off-
tackle play and struck for pay
dirt, In this same quarter, with 12
seconds left to play, the Wildkit.
tens connected on a long pass play
from Rowland to Harrell which
was good for 56 yards and a touch-
down. Both teams missed their try
for extra points and the half ended
with the score 6 and 6. Neither
team scored in the second half.

Davidson play was marked by.
Rowland's passing, which was good
for several long gains and a touch-
down, and Stanleys kicking, which,
with the- exception of a blocked
one, averaged between 45 and 50
yards. ’

The Wildkittens have four re-
maining contests, the next being
with State on October 28. The
State team has several all.State
men on their bench, but neverthe-
less suffered defeat at Durham in
their last game. This game should
be fairly even as it is the second
time either team has taken the
field this year.

Assistant Coach Wilson says
that even with the lightness of the
team they make up for it in fight
and spirit. The squad is in the best
of shape and the few injuries sus-
tained in the Furman game have
already improved so the team is
‘once more at full strength. The
Freshman backfield is one of the
fastest in several years so from all
outward signs the team should
have a pretty good season.

STOCKTON TWINS SHOW FORM

Team Play Is Keynote In Upset Cross
Country Win Over William and Mary

By BILL ADAMS

Bounding back from last week’s
defeat like a brand new boomerang,
Davidson’s cross country lads up-
set the dope sheets and handed
William and Mary's Indians a con-
ference defeat Saturday. morning at
Richardson stadium by the close
score of 28-33, The win was a team
victory, offering convincing proof
of the hardwork and determina.
tion shown by the Red and Black
bearer's since last week's disap-
pointing opener. Davidson has now
broken even in her first two
Southern Conference outings.

Although William and Mary
gathered iv first and second places
in the meet, Davidson showed its
all-around merit and depth by
sending every man on the team
across the finish line before Wil-
liam and Mary’s fourth runner
could finish. Leading the Wildcats
in their victorions chase was
Bradley, who toured -the
Davidson course in 21:45, the best
time of his career on our course,
and a time bettering any turned in
by the renowned Jack Gray at this
point. last year. Only nine seconds
behind Bradley was sophomore

to be another Davidson track

team of D. Stockton, Grube, An-

Slate Clean By Win Over Richmond

Netters Practicing
Under Cobb, Roddey

Davidson's basketballers have
started pounding the hardwood in
order to get in shape for a full sea-
son which opens with the State
College conference champs. Minus
the coach of many successful past
seasons, Norman Shepherd, the
Wildcats will start a clean slate
under the spirited coaching of Boyd
Raird. Although Coach Baird is not
able to be with the team much so
far because of his coaching duties
with the freshman football team,
he will take over a young, but de.
termined group of basketball as-
pirants as soon as possible.

Whit Cobb and Bo Roddey lead
the group of experienced pfayers,
and these two have been serving
as coach in the absence of Baird.
Johnny Richards, now doing a good
job on the gridiron, is expected
to do just as good a job on the
hardwood and continue his fine
form of last season. Dutch Henge-
veld and Tommy Haller, also of
last year’s varsity, are showing good
floor play and should see a lot of
action this year.

Graduates of last year’s fresh-
men team which had an enviable
record, are going to give some real
trouble to the opposition. before the
year is out. The stalwarts of Coach

Davidson heing the high-ranking
scholastic institute that it is, the
three R's stand head and shoulders
above everything else on the Cat
campus this homecoming week-end,
the trio representing Rejuvenation,
Richmond and Rain.

In the face of the injury plague
which has taken its toll in Coach
Charley Jamerson’s husky grid
ranks this past week, rejuvenation
is a difficult task, Richmond looms
every bit as big a threat as the
club which spoiled homecoming last
fall, and Dr. Cunningham's rain,
like the poor, is always with us.

Nevertheless, against Richmond
here tomorrow, Davidson should
be a more reasonable facsimile of
the club which tripped State than
the one which saw its players
knocked right and left in the some-
what surprising. top-heavy spill at
St. Louis last Saturday. Coach
Charley has stressed. rejuvenation.

Cats definitely want this one.

enthusiasm is up for this Southern
