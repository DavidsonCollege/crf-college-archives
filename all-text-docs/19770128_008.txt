Blacks number less than
five percent among Davidson
students, but Deiin of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid, H.
Edmunds White, said the

college is not responsible for -

this misrepresentation.

White insisted that the col-
lege was “‘interested in having
diversity”’ in its student body.

White said that he tried to
encourage students who were
recruiting to seek out students
who would add variety to the
Davidson campus.

He also stated, ‘‘Black stu-
dents have a better chance of
being accepted than whites.
We have no policy on it, but
because they (blacks) add
some diversity, they get a
little edge with certain faculty
members.’’

Leonard Satterwhite, Ad-
missions Counselor. in charge
of minority recruiting, said,
“‘We write to high school
counselors to send names of
outstanding minority stu-
dents. Our emphasis is prin-
cipally with black students,
although American Indians
and other minorities are not
excluded.”’ ;

In spite of these efforts to
increase minority enrollment,
Duff Bruce, former Assistant
Director of Admissions, says
he isn’t satisfied.

“They try to get minorities,
but Davidson doesn’t attract
them because of tuition costs.
My only kick is that they
(Admissions) should make
more exceptions score-wise.”’

Bruce also suggested that if
the staff were increased Sat-
terwhite would have more time
for minority recruiting.

Pat Hudson, President of
the Black Student Coalition,
said he felt the Admissions
Office was making an ‘‘honest
effort this year’’ in recruiting
and admitting minority stu-
dents.

He emphasized that Admis-
sions was making the effort
this year as opposed to last
year, and attributed the rea-
son for this step-up to a
decrease in black students on
campus this year.

Hudson said that the total
number of blacks on campus
this year, 26, was the lowest in
his four years at Davidson.

Erwin Carter, a sophomore
who is in charge of putting
together a brochure for the
Admissions Office focusing on
the black student at Davidson
College, said he thought that
the college would have trouble
attracting qualified blacks:

“Tf they’re that qualified
they won’t be thinking about a
predominantly white school.

They want to go toa school -

where they will really stand
out, so Davidson will be on the
bottom of the list,’’ he said.
Carter, however, praised the
work of the Admissions Office,
especially Satterwhite.
‘‘He’s trying to get more

black students. Every time _

you go to his office, he’s gone.
He’s on the road all the time.
He’s working pretty hard,” he
concluded.

Transfers suffer confusion

By ANN GARNER
Assistant Projects Editor

The dilemmas are numer-
ous. Cries of ‘‘Where do I go to
eat?!” and the dismay of being
housed in a faculty basement
in a remote part of town are
frequent among transfer
students. According to Mary
Lou Dietler, Tony Boon, and
Holly Gnagney, the very idea
of transferring carries with it
connotations of ‘‘loneliness”’
and misplacement, or no
placement ate all in their
respective class.

Transfer students are
accepted from various schools
across the country. Although
there are no statistics, Tony
Boon, Admissions counselor,
feels that most come from
larger universities where they
have become “disillusioned”
and who are seeking a smaller

school with more attention.

Holly Gnagney, co-chair-
man of the Transfer Student
Committee, says that the
problems of transfer students
with admissions is that they
are frequently told at the last

minute of their acceptance.

Thus, the Transfer Student
Committee was formed last
year whose purposes accord-
ing to advisor Mary Lou Diet-
are ‘‘to accomplish the
objectives of orienting the
transfer students; to sensitize
the Davidson community of
the existence and problems of
transfers; and to provide them
with an automatic activity
where they can vent their
frustrations, air grievances,
and share their problems with
other transfers. who are
experiencing same things.’’.”’

Last year the focus of the
committee was upon salvaging
the transfers from the throes
of malnutrition and providing
for them self-selection before
winter term. The project for
the new committee chairmen
Hans Cowan and Holly
Gnagney is to provide some
sort of sanity for them during
registration.

With the success of the
Student Transfer Committee
coupled with the ‘‘bonds of
loneliness” that come to take
the place of the freshman hall

sphere of friendships,
transfers now have an easier
time adjusting to being a
“new” upperclassman while
adding insight and the advan-
tages of greater and varied
experiences.

The trustee quota for coeducation is
going to backfire on them. If their
purpose in trying to maintain close to
1000 men is to uphold the traditional
image of a predominantly male cam-
pus they might re-examine what they
really want.

As it stands the quota deals only
with quantity, not quality. If appli-
cation trends persist competition for
admission for women. will be fiercer
than it is for men. The quality of the
women will surpass the men. °

The futurecould see a Davidson
with women heading organizations,
dominating academics, and socially
castrating the men who feel insecure.

| It_ could. The trend does not uphold a quota,

necessarily yield such a campus. But
the implications are not obscure
enough to be overlooked.

The small number of women here
now is of more pressing concern.
There aren’t enough women here to
render a healthy atmosphere.

The popularity of the women’s
eating house indicates the concern
over the lack of support women feel
here. Increased numbers could help
alleviate the need.

Many men express their frustration
because of their lack of contact with

women purely due to the lack of them. .

And maintaining this lack makes
the admissions department turn down
some qualified women applicants in
favor of less qualified men simply to

All excuses aside, the quota system
means tokenism. It means women are

the world would be in without
super intelligent women—
right off hand I can’t think of
any.”

The possibility of over-
achieving women raises ques-
tions concerning the likely
benefits and detriments of the
College’s adopting a complete-
ly sex-blind admissions policy.
In such a system the sole
criterion for acceptance would
be the applicant’s merit as the
College has traditionally “de>
fined that term.

Speculating on the trustees’
objections to such a policy,
Dean White commented, ‘‘Da-
vidson College was established
as a men’s college. The deci-
sion was made to maintain
1000 men and gradually add
500 women as the facilities and
endowment enable us to do so.

“The 2:1 ratio was seen as a
workable solution. The trus-
tees felt that they had served
and that they wanted to
continue to serve that consti-
tuency of 1000 men.

‘I personally feel that it
would be very bad if you went.
literally to a sex-blind admis-
sions policy which might go to
some extreme.”’

The Dean noted that many
people who favor a sex-blind
policy are naive in assuming a
50;50 ratio would naturally
result.

Moreover, many proponents
of such a policy are not willing
to endorse a situation in which
the College enrolled, say 70
percent women and 30 percent
men. Such an outcome is

©

theoretically possible under a
solely merit based admissions
policy.

Assistant ean Dietler of-
fered a contrasting view. She
said, ‘‘I thinkit would be nice
if we went fo a sex-blind
admissions pdlicy. But that’s
an ideal and/some areas of
college life might make it
impossible.

“If it weremy decision to
make, I would first examine
whether it would work a
financial hardship on the Col-
lege. I wouldjstudy affected
areas and ifs x-blind system
was not possible, I would
shoot for somé ratio close to it
which would éstablish a more
natural community environ-
ment.”

Based on the current rate of
applications, a rigid 50:50
system, in which the 175 most
highly qualified prospects of
each sex were accepted, would
discriminate against men.

Regarding Davidson’s spe-
cial consideration of appli-
cants who are|black, athletes,
or children of alumni, Dean
White remarked that, “Some
would say thefe are inequities
in our policies in those areas,
but I personally think the’
special consideration we give
in those areaS 1S appropriate.
In those areas Our policies are
similar to the policies of most
of the better Colleges I know
about.”

Besides ‘those areas’”’ Da-
vidson also rants special
consideration, as it were, to all
male applicants.
