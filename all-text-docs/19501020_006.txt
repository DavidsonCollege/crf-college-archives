“Duke For The Damsels” Solves
Homecoming Housing Shortage

“Where, oh where, can my fair
date stay; oh, where, oh where
can she sleep?” you were singing
as you walked past Mrs. Little's
office in Watts one fateful morn-
ing. “Ah-hah-hal” said the dormi-
tory supervisor as she grabbed you
by the ear and led you to a chair
before her desk. “I have just the
room for your girl. A beautiful
little cubby hole in the basement
of Duke should be dandy. Sign here,
please.” Quickly you scrawled “Joe
Collitch” on the proffered sheet of
paper, and, surprised but happy,
thanked the lady. It was not until
then that she showed you the fine
print which provided that your
wench would have to stoke the fur-
nace for two days.

As you zipped up your jaw you
learned that this was the latest so-
lution to the old problem of where
to house the fair ones during dance
weekends. All the students in Duke
had cheerfully volunteered to vacate
their rooms to help out. (Come on
out of that closet, Mac, it'll only
be for a couple of days.)

You soon found that the “Duke
for the Damsels” plan had repercus-
sions, too. Early in the week the
lucky guys on the east side of East
dormitory started renting out field
glasses,and by Friday afternoon
dateless Davidsonians were form-
ing all up and down in front of
Duke to admire the pulchritude.

.All the closed drapes and quiet at-

mosphere (Hey, throw me my skirt,
Gert) gave the place the appear-
ance of a convent,

This was Davidson going ali out
to make the gals at home. The:
was a rumor that a professor was
sleeping in the bathtub so a couple
of girls might use his room, and
down at the College Pharmacy

Hugo was renting sleeping bags
and space in the store booths. Then
you learned later that they were
kicking guys out of Rumple to have

moré space, However, some joker
with a warped sense of humor
spoiled everything by putting a
“Condemned” sign on the front
door. The Pan-Hellenic detectives
are still working on that case.

You realize now, though that
everything is working out for the
best. Except for the guys who are
invading the wilderness of the old
gym for the weekend, the situation
looks fine for all.

Vive la Spivak!

HOWE GREENE...
(Continued From Page Two)
“Snake”, who approached Howe
and Ellen with the confidence bred
of experience. “You haven't intro.
duced me to your queen, Howe,”
he drooled. “Oh, Snake, I want you
to meet Ellen White from Corn-
verse College, down in Sparking-
burg. Ellen, meet “Snake” Sim.
mons.” .
“I am very pleased to meet you,
Ellen,” he replied softly. “May I
have the first dance after the fi-
gure?” “I'd love to “Snake”. ; .that
is if Howe doesn’t. . .” “Snake”
turned to Howe, “I’m sure Howe
wouldn’t mind if I had one dance
with his beautiful girl, would you
Howe?” and his voice sounded a

little sharper as he finished.

By now the figure had come te
an end, and everyone was again
dancing. “Snake” led his conquest
onto the floor, and drawing her up
close, turned on all his charm.
Howe had lost his date.

Seeing how disastrousiy yester-
day turned out for Howe, I wonder
what will happen today.

verse, hardly comparable, but ter-
ribly out of line, according to Mr.
Hansen's theories:

Mary had a little lamb,

Its fleece was white as snow.

The tragedy here is that “snow”
doesn’t rhyme with “lamb.” Of
course, for “snow” we could sub.
stitute slamb, or cramb, or shamb,
or damb, or some other word per-
taining to college life. Better still,
lets make Mary shake off that

If someone ever bothered to take
a lots of surface noise, record it.
then play it backwards the results
would very probably approach the
conglomeration of baby talk and
stuff (that’s the only word to de-
scribe it) you will hear on the new
London release “Molasses, Molass-
es.” It undoubtably is the worst
thing I have ever heard on wax.
All that talk about “Molasses, Mo-
lasses, it’s icky, Sticky goo”; it's
plain terrible. To make it worse
all the leading recording companies
have cut it too. If they're that hard
up for ‘material 1 think I'll write
a song.

In writing about the latest re-
leases by Perry Como a few para-
graphs back 1 overlooked several
new tunes that I certainly should
at least mention, (and besides I
need enough material to finish out
the column.) Perry and Betty Hut-
ton combine talents to sing a fast
moving discing labeled “A Bushel
And A Peck” It’s rather cute al.
though “Gravel Throat” Hutton
gets rather loud in places which
doesn’t help the tune at all. Perry
solos on “Marcheta” and the re-
suits are much more pleasant minus
the aid of Miss Hutton.

ed a W & L General, with the
Wildcats’ large eyes watching his
every move. The background music
(this sounds like the Stork Club)
comes from a loudspeaker in the

Departing a little from the array
of Generals and Wildcats roaming
around the premises, the Pi Kaps
are busy constructing a miniature
train on an 8 by 12’ platform.
Mounted on the engine is the iig-

strengthened with four new addi-

innovation. Open calisthentics will
be presented on the drill field in
the morning. The afternoon’s game
will be witnessed by some 500
spectators on Davidson's own field.
After last week’s defeat. by Fur-
man, the scrappy Wildcats, whose
backfield averages 156 pounds and
whose line averages in at 159, will
try to break the long-standing 24-
game win (or tie) record of the

freshmen of N. C. State.

Tonight at 8:00 in Shearer Hall—
a mixed crowd—there will be sev-
eral presentations of stunts. The
Glee Club will sponsor a chorus,
quartet, soloist, jazzy and symphony
orchestra and the Guitar and Man-
dolin club. These stunts and musi-
cal arrangements will finish off a
day which will be treasured in the
hearts of the attendants for many
months to come.

But what is the contemporary
scene? Surely we can't lift a day,
such as this, from history without
examining the concurrent events.
The local theatres are showing:
at the Alahambra Cecil B. De Mille’s

at the Imperial is “The Cost of Fol-

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1950

The Maxwell-Chambers Hotel
(?) announced in the Davidsonian
that “They take pleasure in solicit-
ing ‘banquets and those college
feeds,” whereas the “Stud” adver-
tized “Freshy fruits, candy, sand-
wiches, milk and even cigarettes
It’s yours, why not patronize it?”

The town paper stated that “A
double- header freight passed
through Davidson at noon. Only
a few of the students and towns-
people were present to witness the
event; if we had known it was com-
ing someone might have had the
presence of mind to ring the fire
bell.”

The proventiality of the situation
is struck in a joke (?) “Freshmen.
if you think this place is dead, all
we ask you to do is to take a trip

to Mount Mourne; just one trip.”

But how? A new road has just been
put in allowing the free passage of
automobiles, The editor of the Da-
vidsonian commented prophetically
“The day of bumming has passed.
(courtesy riding). The new road
opened last spring facilitates this
ungentlemanly act. Of course, it’s
all right to ask a stopped car, but to
flag down a passing ‘car’ only leads
to trouble for both driver and rider.
Tt is felt that the ease of riding to
Charlotte has hurt spring training
and the shape of the football team.
Several train schedules have now
been cancelled because of the loss
of passengers.”

On this line in the advertising
realm: “Fellows—we have several
new U-push-’em Fords at you dis-
posal. Prices reasonable. See us at
any time. Henderson Filling Sta-
tion;" “Now at Tate-Brown—gas
bag shoes—‘C'llegiate’—light mel-
low tan—$8.00 or “Buy Victor rec-
ords. Latest hit— “I’m Gonna
Charleston Back to Charleston” by
the Revelers—Price 75c.”

A news flash is “Women at the
University of. Oklahoma have be-
gun to flavor lipsticks. The fad is
fast spreading over the university
town and great ingenuity is being
used to get different flavors—which
range from lemon to tutti-frutti.”

The Victor theatre in Mooresville.
N. C. has a programme on Novem.
ber 4 with Graham Prince and his
orchestra—"The ‘Hottest Thing
Since The Chicago Fire.”

One joke running around now is
“Necessity knows no law; Boot-
leggers know no law; therefore
bootleggers are a necessity.”

There has been a move afoot to
get up for women a post-graduate

school to train in religious educa-
tion and our editor comments in
protest: “For if the students here
have many more distractions to
keep them from their studies, there
will be a Homecoming Day estab-
lished right after the first semester
each year that will vie with Home-
coming Day in the Fall.” This guy
must be “off his nut.” e

Our jokes are getting more sen.
suous (sensual) and less sensible:
“He: Can you read lips? She: Only
by the touch system.” And the
world situation is seen influx as:
“Whether the U. S. will cast her
lot with the leading countries of
the civilized world in the World
Council of Permanent Justice, or she
will she continue her policy of
aloofness from international af-
fairs?”

Well, last year we tied State 10-
10. “Under the tutorage of Younger
and Tilson the Davidson Wildcats
this year have risen from the ranks
of mediocrity and now have an en.
viable position in football circles.
Everyone knows that the name of
Davidson is synonomous with that
of sportsmanship?” @¥es, listeners!
everyone knows who kept their
goal line inviolate as they won a
9.0 victory on that first Homecom-
ing day. What will be the outcome
this year?

BANDS SHARE...
(Continued From Page One)

Furman game in Charlotte it join-
ed with the Furman band in pre-
game formations and gave an at-
tractive half-time drill. In Clinton,
S. C., for the P. C. game it gave
an unusual maneuver based on the
Broadway hit South Pacific. The
members formed a palm tree with
lights on their shoes while the
stadium lights were turned off and
at the same time playing “Some
Enchanted Evening” from the mu-
sical.

Band director Moore, a new mem-
ber of the music department faculty
this year, is a graduate of Univer-
‘sity of Illinois and Julliard School
of Music, holding a master’s de-
gree in music.

Throughout his college career at
Illinois, Moore played in the fa-
mous Illinois football band, gain-
ing much experience which he is
now putting to use at Davidson.

Moore is married and has one
nine month old child. Both he and
his wife are musicians—he a clari-
netist and she a cellist.
