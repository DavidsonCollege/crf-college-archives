FLAG searching for leadership, direction for future

from page 1

it was like to have been a “‘closet”
gay at Davidson a few years ago.

Organizing the event may
prove to be difficult, since the ac-
tive membership of FLAG is low
right now. Hansard says that of the
42 people who claim to be mem-
bers, only about eight show up for
meetings every week.

The low membership is a bit
perplexing, considering that atten-
dance at FLAG-sponsored events,
including the FLAG Fashion show
anda speaker on gay marriages, has
been quite high.

Approximately 400 students at-
tended the fashion show and about
90 showed up for the speaker.
Hansard doesn’t understand why
members have become inactive, but
hopes that it is because they are
busy with other activities and not
because they are dissatisfied with
FLAG for some reason.

She says that she and another
FLAG member plan to call each
member individually, asking if
FLAG went wrong somewhere.

With membership so low, there
has been some concern that FLAG
might not be around next year at all.
Hansard indicates that one of the
topics of discussion at FLAG meet-
ings is whether or not to bother
petitioning the Activities Tax Coun-
cil for funds. She says that she will
be abroad in the fall and that a good
portion of active members will be
graduating this year.

The group is currently trying to
figure out who, if anyone, will take
over for 1997-98. No one has vol-
unteered to lead the homosexuality
portion of PE 101 in the Fall and
there are few members who have
shown an interest in FLAG leader-
ship next year.

OfFLAG’s decimation, Knight
says, “I’m definitely worried about
it. It is a possibility.”

For his own part, Knight
dropped out of the leadership of
FLAG for a number of reasons.
Time constraints were part of the
difficulties he faced, but he cited a
general “attitude of apathy” as the
main reason he chose to take a back
seat in the organization this semes-

the new spring

ter. He said that getting help from
FLAG members in setting up for,
running, and clearing events was
like “pulling teeth.”

Knight adds that chairmanship
of FLAG is more than just a techni-
cal or social position, but also has a
sizeable political portion. Prefer-
ringamore personal, informal style,
he was never quite comfortable with
that aspect of the position. Hansard,
on the other hand, says, “I would
like to see FLAG become more
political.”

FLAG’s purpose is to educate
people and make them more aware
of gay concerns and issues. Hansard
indicates that, contrary to popular
belief, there is still room to increase
understanding of homosexuality on
campus.

She says that-openly gay stu-
dents are often stared at and ridi-
culed. They also have to deal with
presumptuous students who assume
that every time a homosexual greets
someone of the same sex, a pass is
being made and that every same-
sex friend of theirs is actually their
boyfriend or girlfriend.

The journal publishes 400 vol-

widespread as Japan, New Zealand,
Iceland, Israel, Russia, and Eu-
rope.
Other Davidson professors
and students participate in the pro-

ments Ann Douglas are editorial
assistants.

Davidson is recognized in the

journal as a primary supporter of
their effort.
“Bringing the journal to Davidson
is very beneficial for the faculty
and students who have the oppor-
tunity to work on it and for the
College to have its name attached
to an international scholarly jour-
nal,” says Eirich.

Vladimir Nabakov fled Rus-
sia during the Russian Revolution.
He spent the 1920s and 30s in exile
in Germany and France, finally
coming to the US in 1940 to teach
at Cornell University.

Nabokov is recognized s one
of the foremost prose writers in
Russian and English twentieth cen-

tury.

Bergman makes case
for affirmative action

By NARESH NAGELLA
Associate News Editor

The sixth annual Cornelson
Distinguished Lecturer Dr. Barbara
Bergman of American University
in Washington D.C. gave a talk
regarding affirmative action on
March 25.

The lecture is brought to
Davidson by the Economics De-
partment. Bergman was the former
president of the American Associa-
tion of Professors and Vice Presi-
dent of the American Economic As-
sociation.

Clark Ross, chairman of the
Economics Department, praised her
for the lasting value of her eco-
nomic analyses and for her convic-
tion to the belief that ‘we are all
created equally and should have
equal opportunities” in his intro-
ductory remarks.

Bergman is best known for her
books and scholarly analyses which
defend affirmative action policies.

Her talk focused on highlight-
ing the mistakes and weaknesses in
more popular arguments against
affirmative action. ‘

She used an example of a res-
taurant that ran an ad featuring their
wait staff — all 38 of them white
males. She called the restaurant to
find out why therestaurant followed
those hiring practices. The response
was that it was unintentional and
that their workers were productive
and pleasing to the customers.

Bergman stated that this re-
sponse is common in firms who do
not follow affirmative action poli-

_ cies, stating, “The excuse of pleas-

ing customers and maximizing prof-
its should not be a justification for
not hiring women or minorities but
may be the true reasons for why
they do not get hired.”

She then turned to why it is so

hard for women and minorities to
ensure their merit and credentials
give them appropriate jobs, since
the Civil Rights Act can only be
enforced through a lawsuit.

“These lawsuits can take one
to two decades to finish and most
people hurt by this behavior do not
know why they were discrimi-
nated,” says Bergman. “And, there
is much social science research that
suggests when people hire they do
notice people’s sex and race.”

Bergman then gave her views
on a Supreme Court decision on the
issue regarding a New Jersey case
where a teacher had to be let go and’
where it had to be either a white or
black teacher of “equal merit” that
got fired.

The black teacher was kept
since the school felt that it would be
better for the students to have diver-
sity in their teachers.

The white teacher sued saying
her race was used against her to
reach the decision.

“[The white teacher] is right.
But, they could have thought about
other measures to find differences
or aspects of merit like forcing the
teachers to take an English test or
comparing the teacher’s attendance
numbers,” says Bergman.

“There are values in diversity
that could be more important even
if the white teacher was more merit
worthy. That is what affirmative
action is all about and it is regret-
table but not as regrettable as what
the situation is like for blacks and
women.” :

Overall she left the audience to
determine when “diversity can be a
value that can trump merit.”

She believes our country can
not come together otherwise, for
she states, “If we are to get out of
our present situation of separation
we need these policies.”

Interim Board of Trustees Chair-
man Olin Nisbet was referred to as
Olin Nesbit in the March 24 issue
of The Davidsonian. The Editors
regret the error.
