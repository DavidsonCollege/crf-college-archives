On more than one occasion, when he has been scheduled to
give an hour long lecture to a college audience, he has been
found to be still speaking six hours later!

Fuller frequently challenges college students to define the
torens vaetey sad Dymanea, Sad & scantation’ by thee:
frequent inability to do so. Fuller defines synergy as ‘‘the
behavior of a whole system unpredicted by the behavior of its
components—or any subassembly of its components.’’ He ex-
trapolates from this to indicate that in nature, industry, and

iety, wholes express more than just the simple effect
resulting from the sum of their respective parts.

This concept is crucial to his utilization of General Systems
Theory as combined with computer technology and cybernetics
(computer strategy) to approach and resolve successfully the
great major issues which confront mankind today. Contained
within such utilization, or synergetics, are the germinal seeds
for the solution of the energy crisis, population problems, world
hunger, wars, and the myriad array of ecological debilities
which confront contemporary mankind. It enables us to tap at
the existent unity between the environment and the universe to

Another dimension of Fuller’s Weltanschauung, or world
view, is expressed by the term Dymaxion. a label he uses to
qualify the implications of his , inventions, and
projected ideas. Briefly stated, his Dymaxion holds

“‘Highlight”’ is a word that the
James Band has
not been used to hearing, but it
is one that has been popping
up with increasing frequency.

This relatively little-known
group has started out in a
typical well-structured
fashion, having built up a
large local following in

Students who keep pets
during the year should make
provision for them at the end
of the academic year. Pets
should not be deserted and left
to fend for themselves.

Care should be taken to find
the animal a good home if the
student is not able to keep it. If
there is no other possibility,
the student should take the
animal to the Animal Shelter.

There are which
we meet in having animals on
campus. The pets are depen-
dent on us and it is our respon-
sibility to see that they get
adequate care.

However, is there the
necessity of impounding the
stray animals which are com-
munity property here at
Davidson? I can’t imagine a
spring afternoon without the
uproar created by the David-
son Forty-one.

There have been rumors cir-
culating on campus about a
no-knock search-and-seizure

their hometown of Boston
before seriously seeking any
national attention.

So far, their approach has
been perfect. The trying at-
mospheres of Beantown club
performances have molded
these six men into a tight and
aggressive group with a
driving and intense style that
has captivated audiences on
their current tour of the U.S.

This six-man group is fron-
ted by vocalist Montgomery,
who doubles on forceful har-
monica. They vary their per-
formance with a fine blend of
traditional blues, boogie, and
rock which is characterized by

The group’s first album has
been a victim of misproduc-
tion and shows very little of
the band’s live potential.

The best things that can be
said about this up and coming
group are the things that
others have had to say about
their performances.

For example, Alan Niester,
in the Jan. 17 issue of Rolling
Stone calls them, ‘‘tight and
exciting, producing onstage
music that is aggressive, yet
self controlled.’’

In Cashbox magazine, a
review of their recent concert
with Dave Mason proclaimed
that, ‘‘an unexpected delight
on the bill was...the exciting
James Montgomery Band,
— turned the audience on

a rousing set.”’

Cashbox went on to say that
“the group tore the house
apart...” and that ‘the band
paid careful attention to
dynamics and this resulted in
a clean, yet powerful sound.”

The James Montgomery
Band--they’re not exactly
something to write home
about—not yet, anyway. But on
the basis of the great things
people have been saying about

‘them, it seems Davidson is in

for an exciting concert Satur-
day night.

Davidson will have the op-
portunity to judge the
statement in Cashbox that “‘It
looks...like this band is going
all the way.”’
