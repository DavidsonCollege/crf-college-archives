LARGE FOOTBALL SQUAD
BEGINS EARLY PRACTICE,

The Davidson football squad began
practice a week or two earlier this year
than ever before. A few of the old let-
ter men came back almost a month be-
fore the opening of school, and by the}
25th of August, the formal opening of |
practice, nearly three teams were on|
hand. The first Freshman on hand was |
Hendricks, the star Greensboro quar-|
terback. He was followed a few days
later by the equally famous Fresh Hay, |
from a great metropolis in South Caro-|
lina.

Monday, August 29th, will go down in|
the annals of Davidson football as the
great “monkey day,” for on that event- |
ful afternoon the entire squad, from the
mighty varsity center Brice down to the

humblest Fresh lineman, saw great
droves of these alluring quadrupeds
swarming all over the field. Indeed,

Tuesday found the squad so exhausted
that there were not quite two full teams
able to practice, and a meeting Of the
cripples had to be called that night for
purposes of classification and mass
treatment. The next day practice was
called almost an hour later in the aft-
ernoon and the supper hour was chang-
ed, to the great satisfact all con-
cerned,

A great deal of theoretical work was
taken up in the morning meetings of the
squad. Books by prominent football
coaches were studied and plays were
worked out on the blackboard. The
rule book was studied rule by rule, and
at the end of the period a test was
given on it.. Several members of the
squad pulled down a flat 100. Fresh
Boggs’ grade has not been released for
publication.

By the opening of school the squad
had improved markedly and almost all
the men were in good condition. The
first and the only serious casualty among
the Freshmen was Fresh Hunt's shoul-
der. LaFar’s knee and Clarke’s leg are
the most serious weaknesses now trou-
bling the varsity. Other prominent crip-
ples have been ’Sorrels, Bradley, Rich-
ards, Brown, McLaurin, and Mauze, Al-
most all of them, however, are in con-
dition now.

R. O. T. C. NEWS NOTES

The R. O. T. C. executives are to be
congratulated upon the efficiency with
which they have handled the inevitable
difficulties of a new year. Major Hearn,
after a summer at Camp Knox, has or-
ganized the R. O. T. C. on a new plan
this year. The officers and non-com-
missioned officers are to be appointed
for merit rather than by class. The
battalion is to be formed by classes two
days out of the week and by companies
on one day. There will be four com-
panies again this year.

The uniforms and equipment have al-
ready been issued to the upper classmen
and are to be issued to the Freshmen
this week. Shoes will not be issued this
year, but otherwise the uniform will be
the same as heretofore.

The theoretical work has also begun.
Most of the classes are to be held in
the Concord Street building. Major
Hearn is to instruct the Seniors and
Juniors, Captain Ellis will have the
Sophomores, and Captain Weatherby
the Freshmen. :

The Band, too, has begun practise un-
der Capt. G. N. Neel. A good number of
new men are musically inclined and a
good Band is to be expected.

REPORTS PROMISE CLOSE
GAME WITH VIRGINIANS

With the game between the Wildcats
and the boys from the Old Dominion
just a little over a week away, news
comes from their camp that a hard game
is expected. Virginia has a squad of
about 25 men working out under the
direction of Coach Warren. Included in
this squad are eight letter’ men, and
several likely looking Freshmen from
last year’s Freshman team.

Virginia is sure to have a strong team,
for, with eight letter men, last year’s
substitutes, and the Freshmen of last
-year they have an abundance of mate-
rial to choose from. Virginia’s line
should be the strongest in a number of
years. Former Captain Michie, an end,
