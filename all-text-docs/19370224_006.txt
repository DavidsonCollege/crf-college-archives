“A Century at Davidson,”

by Majel Ivey Seay.

The article contained many in-

that Davidson is the only college
within an area of one hundred and
square with
as high rating as can be given by
the Educational Association o
Americagthe Association of Ameri-
can Colléges, and the Association
of Colleges in Southern States.

Taking up the historical back-
ground of the college, it was stated
that the present student body and
faculty came from an embryo of

many interesting sidelights into
the amounts payed for room, board,
tuition, etc. were given as well as
an interesting history of the man-

at Davidson for some years

A “BLESSED EVENT”

“Lady,” a black and white fox-

modern society prepares for “bless-

On the verge of having pups, she
walked into the Washington Uni-
versity clinic and wagged her tail
for recognition. A few days later
“Lady,” attended by, nurses and in-
ternes, gave birth to six puppies.

Of Students, Is Dead

The
lost

students of Davidson have
one of their best friends. A
little dog of questionable pedigree
has departed from this earth as un-
noticed as he made his entrance.
To show nis affection for his
friends, he would often follow them
to and from their classes. And
often when he thought Mrs. Smith
was far away, he would watch his
chance to slip in the dormitories to
visit his cronies. He was always
welcome wherever he went; and
even when some treated him rough-
ly, he did not lose his temper, but
acted like a true Davidson gentle-
man.

Recently, however, his health had
not been up to par. There is little
doubt to the fact that he had been
missing meals from time to time,
and his condition had become such
that one was able to count his,ribs
through his flea infested skin, Many
were worried about this little dog.

Deputation Goes To
Charlotte ‘Y’ Sunday

Two Davidson students, Tom
Harnsberger and Robert R. King
were sent on a Y. M,. C. A. depu-
tation to Charlotte last Sunday. The
men spoke at a boys’ service held
regularly in the Charlotte “Y” at
three o'clock on Sundays.
Harnsberger spoke to the older
of the two groups of boys present
on the subject of China. King ad-
dressed the younger group of boys
on Africa and the boys of America,
comparing and contrasting them.

on the road to recovery. His condi-
tion continued to the extent that a
certain city official had to be called
to %ction. Everyone may relieve
their mind, because he did not have
a horrible death. He went out
quickly with less pain suffered than
if he had lingered on. Yes, it’s true.
Our pal, Bismarck, has entered a
new world.

President Writes For
Christian Observer

Dr. W. L. Lingle, president of
Davidson College, has for the past
five years given his regular weekly
contribution’ to the Christian Ob-
server. In 1925 he began a series
of weekly articles for Presbyterian
of the South and served in that
capacity until 1932, when he took
over his weekly article in the Chris-
tian Observer, “Talks on Timely
Topics.” From that day until now
he has contributed his page every
week.

Dr. Lingle states, “My articles
are written mainly, for parents, and
outside people and not so much for
the ministers; I take the other peo-
ple into consideration when I am
writing my articles.”

In one of his articles, Dr. Lingle
pays tribute to Dwight L. Moody
and says that Moody lived one of
the fullest richest lives that any
mortal-man ever lived, and that the
Centennial year of Moody deserves
more than a passing mention.

Attends. Meeting

On Wednesday, Feb. 17, Dr. T.
W. Lingle went to Chapel Hill to
attend a meeting of the Commission
on Historical Markers of Highways
of North Carolina.

Dr. Lingle is a member of this
commission which selects localities
and prepares forms of statement for
these historical markers. Then the
contract is given to an iron foun-
dry to prepare the markers, and the
commission has them put up.

Seventy-five of the markers are
now up throughout the state, espe-
cially in the eastern part, and forty
more have been approved and con-
tracted for. The marker for Dav-
idson is due to arrive in the very
near future,
