The first half, which was domi-

For 88 minutes, the men’s soccer team gave
UNC Charlotte — a national semifinalist a year

ago — all it could handle.

But the other two minutes belonged to 49er

John Mabee.

During that span, which occured midway
through the second half, Mabee collected two
goals to guide UNCC to a 3-0 victory Saturday
night in front of 2,133
at Richardson Field.

Just over 60 minutes
into the match, Ben
Parry cleared the ball

centered it beautifully for Mabee.

With few Wildcat defenders in the area, the
junior striker had little difficulty in pushing the
ball past Davidson goalkeeper Brad Stroble.

A minute and a half later, Mabee notched
his second goal in traffic, depositing a ricocheted
shot by Chris Schmalz in the back of the cage.

“We had one let-down period in the whole
game,” coach Charlie Slagle said after the con-
test. “And Charlotte took advantage of that one

let-down.”

With just over a minute left in the contest,
with the outcome in little doubt, Matthew Bradner
delivered the knock-out punch, accounting for

the final three-goal margin.

The scoreless first half was one in which
Davidson had opportunities to score.

“If we score just once in the first half, it is an
entirely different game,” explained Slagle. “If
we score first, then it puts them in a different

frame of mind.”

UNCC keeper Brad Thomas, replacing 1996
first team All-American Jon Busch,
three saves in recording his first collegiate shut-

. out.

The victory evened the 49ers’ record at 1-1,
and should help improve their current rank of
16th in the nation in the Soccer News poll.

The defeat dropped Davidson to 0-3, but the
squad remains upbeat, and was able to take
something positive away. from Saturday’s loss.

“T was really excited about it
(the goal), especially since it was
my first goal in college,” Gold said.
“Tt was just a great experience. No
one gave up after last week, and
now we can look forward to the rest
of the season.”
