> Student being tried for

removing post office flag

By SARAH OGDEN
Staff Writer

“T thought that my actions [re-
flected] my values, my love for this
country,” insists Davidson senior
Ryan Gist. Gist, along with seniors
Brian Cowan and Thomas Dugan
were detained by police in relation
to the September 4 theft of the flag
that flies at the front entrance of the
Davidson post office. Gist says that
he, Cowan, and Dugan went to the
post office around 10:30 that night
to check their mailboxes, only to
find the American flag flying with-
out proper illumination, which is
illegal under Title 36 of the U.S.
Code. Gist lowered and folded the
flag, intending to return it to post
office officials the next morning.

Later that night, however, the
boys, who were suspected of hav-
ing stolen the flag, were located by

campus police and brought in for .

questioning. According to the cam-
pus police report, “Further investi-
gations revealed that Gist had taken
the flag down as he felt it was his
patriotic duty.” Once the situation
had been explained, the police con-
tacted post office authorities, and it
was agreed that, as long as the flag
was returned, no one would press
charges. “I thought it was over,”
said Gist.

But it was just beginning.
About a week after the incident,

Gist received a call from Ernest
Jeffries, Assistant Dean of Students
and Director of Minority Student
Affairs.

Dean Jeffries, who has refused
to comment on the situation, told
Ryan that he was being charged
with violating Section III of the
Code of Responsibility, which deals
with social responsibility and states,
“Social conduct is...tobe based upon
concern for others and must con-
form to high standards of courtesy
and propriety.” Section XII of the
Code allows this to be enforced
even in acts that occur off-campus,
as in Gist’s case.

Gist comments, “One problem
Ihave with Dean Jeffries is that, the
minute I got in there [Jeffries’ of-
fice], he was basically telling me
that I had to go in front of the J
Board [Judicial Committee] and ...
confess that this was wrong. I said
that  wouldn’tsubmitto the J Board,
and I wanted an Honor Council
hearing. Now I’m going to go in
front of the Honor Council and have
a public hearing — the first [public
hearing] in a long time.

“[This has] completely under-
mined my confidence in the effi-
cacy of the Judicial Board here,”
Gist continues. “People think that
when you get charged with some-
thing, you are automatically
screwed. You’re convicted. That’s
the way I felt when I went in there.

And I think a big part of it is when

they first counsel you, they make
you feel like you have no way out,
and that whether you’re guilty or.
not you’re going to get in trouble.
And that’s why I almost went to the
J Board and [admitted guilt]. I
knew it wouldn’t be that bad of a
sentence. But I just realized that it’s
so against my values, it’s not worth
it for me,” he added.

Gist said the worst punishment
he expects is social probation or
community service. “I don’t expect
a conviction, though,” he adds
quickly. -

Ryan, who is currently active
in ROTC and intends to go into the
military after graduation, says he
acted because “it’s disrespectful to
the flag. I’m going to put my life on
the line for my country. My grand-
father fought in World: War II; he
was a prisoner of World War II. My
dad was in the army.”

In light of recent events, the
Davidson post office allegedly plans
to install proper illumination for the
flag.

The date and location for the
hearing had not been determined
when this issue went to print.

Seniors Josie Hoover and Vir-
ginia Fisher are the student solici-
tors him and seniors Wesley Hart
and Damon Colbert are the defense
advisors. Students may attend the
trial.
