Mr. Plato and Mr. Staff Query
seem to differ somewhat over the
definition of concepts.

“Great guns! Someone must be
throwing a bed down the steps.”
“Gosh no! That’s the band tun-

ing up.”

Come look them over.

When she says it is “heavenly”
does she mean “un-earthly ?”

Lowrance says “None of us are as
good looking as we think we are.”

It’s very well to debate giving la-
i borers a representative on the board
of trustees of industrial organiza-
tions, but why not a student repre-
‘sentative at the faculty meeting?

The following note was handed
some Davidson men while on a trip:

“Do any of you know these boys?
If so, please give them my best re-
gards. | am compused, so cannot
say a thing. (David Lowrance, Carl
Cathey, John Caldwell, Fred
Smith.”) (Signed) Cornelia .

She called us “dear” and said we
were “cute.” We uns raised plum
to pup heaven. She pretty soon
spied a “dear young pig” and a “cute
little nigger.” Great was the fall
from pup heaven.

First Fresh—‘“What didja have
t’eat?”

Second Fresh-—“Shavings, dough-
balls, bull, ointment and zip.”

Davidson was well represented at
the “Idol Dancer,” which appeared
in Charlotte last week.

How to Pass Without Studying.

1. Call the prof by his nick-name
—there’s nothing like being chum-
m

5 Volunteer information when-
ever possible—great will be the ap-
preciation thereof.

3. Incase you don’t know what's
asked you, answer an imaginary
question—it’s oh, so easy to hush
"em.

4. Wear the appearance of hav-
ing boned all night—a good drunk
accomplishes this.

5. Always assume a confident air
—the prof won’t take a chance on
getting shot.

6. Try to divert his attention by
carrying on a conversation extra-
neous to the lesson—as the Overall
Club, for instance. .

7. Be absorbed in looking out the

window—nothin
you know it all.

Pull.
When a man who says “have saw,”
And who writes that “I onct seen,”
Gets to be the high and mighty
On a college magazine.
That'll pull.

g like acting like

When a guy who don’t know “A”
From the old proverbial “Izzard,”
Makes the mark on all his classes,
Same as if he were a wizard,
That’s pull.

When a man who can’t tell “do”
From its sister note called “re,
Gets to blow the mighty fog-horn
In the orchestra—l'll say
That’s pull.

Now the way to get that pull, Bo,
Is what worries Uncle Ed.
But a boot-black sure should have it,
Judging from what I’ve heard
said.

At the R. O. T. C. Field Day.

First Fresh (after C Company had:

won fourth consecutive event)—“l
believe there is something fishy
about C.”

Second Fresh—‘Sure, sea’s full of
fish.”

Blessing as asked at boarding
house: “Look out, Lord, we're go-
ing to eat.”

R. 0. T. C. TO BE
INSPECTED SOON

Captain Mueller Makes Important

Notice.

1, An officer representing the
War Vlans Division of the General
Staff will inspect the R. O. T. C.
unit of Davidson College on May 5,
1920.

2. The purpose of this inspection
is to judge and rate our efficiency
for the purpose of determining our
final classificatior in comparison
with other colleges within our class.

3. The inspector will take special
notice of the following:

(1) Military bearing.

(2) Neatness of clothing—to be
free from stains, and no buttons
missing.

(3) Wearing of collar ornaments.

(4) Cleanliness of shoes, oiled or
shined. ,

(5) Wearing black ties.

(S) Hats with four indentations.

(7) Hat cords sewed on.

(8) Adjustment of belts and packs.

(9) Cleanliness of rifles.

(10) Having your dummy cart-
ridges in belt.

(11) Bayonets clean.

(12) Having five tent pins, pole,
guy ropes, and rope loops for pins.

(13) Attention to military cour-
tesy and proper wearing of uniform
when off duty.

(14) Wearing of chevrons by non-
commissioned officers.

(15) Having your whistles, com-
passes, flag-kits with you at full
pack inspection.

(16) Percentage of absentees.

4. At drills your smartness and
manner of giving commands will be
noted.
nothing to fear from the inspector
in the way of personal criticisms or
unreasonable requirements. His duty
is to tell us what he wants; to see
and to observe and note the result
for the information of the War De-
partment.

5. Students clothing which is
torn, stained, or badly worn should
call at the armory and get such re-
placements as we are able to fur-
nish. Oil for shoes, buttons, needle
and thread are all available at ar-
mory.

6. Every student should put forth
his best effort to anticipate all the
foregoing needs for the Honor of
Davidson College. A rating as a
Distinguished College is a very
great honor, and if you can achieve
this at the end of your first year’s
training, you will indeed have per-
formed nobly a patriotic duty merit-
ing the esteem of all good citizens.
Your class, the student body, the
faculty, and your family, and your
government, will be proud of you
and your accomplishment and will
honor you for it.

A. H. Mueller,
Captain, Calvary.
