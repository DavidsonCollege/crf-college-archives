Whether you've really
realized it or not, there
has been a tremendous
change on this campus
as to the general athletic
policy. as well as specific
. examples. The general
over the coals enough,

have been some, but
seem to have

football situation and

lowed.

Something that has indeed brightened the picture has been
the rise of interest in the art and sport of wrestling. Last week
when it was announced that for the second straight year David-
son had been awarded the AAU Wrestling Tournament, it seemed

to carry out the idea that we've come a long way in the last few.

years. For years and years the center of wrestling in the Southern
Conference was in Virginia and especially at Washington and
Lee and V.M.I. No school in North or South Carolina could
hold a light to the grappling of the Virginians except possibly
the aggregation from Appalachian, which is not even in the
Southern.

CHANGE NOTED DESPITE WINLESS TEAMS

Now with the increased interest among the students and a
“‘go-getter” like Coach Scott, who is vitally interested in wrest-
ling and has put out some fine teams himself, it looks like David-
son actually is emerging and sometimes in the near future will be
looked upon as the center of wrestling in the conference.

The amazing thing about the whole situation is

that although we have some fine individual performers

and some potentially great wrestlers, we have not had a

good, winning season in several years. Again the answer .

comes from the inner office where Coaches Scott and

Charlie Parker have put. their heads together and de-

cided to run this thing in a business-like manner.

GRAPPLING AFTER BASKETBALL
SHOWS VARIETY

The most notable change has been in the scheduling of the
matches and holding of them, whenever possible, right after the
well-attended home games in basketball. Everyone seems to
stay and the amount of yelling and ‘pleading seems to signify the
interest and enjoyment of the crowd.

The biggest honor of the present rise to the fore
seems to me to be the fact that also the Olympic try-
outs for the entire Southeastern United States will be
held on the campus two weeks later than the AAU
Tourney. Here lies the national prominence which the
sport of the gladiators brings to Davidson, for there
are only four to six of these tourneys held in the entire
country in preparation for the world-wide games at
Helsinki in the summer. The U.S. always has a strong
team and who knows but what a winner might sprout
forth from this tournament?

THE FUTURE MAY HOLD HIGHER HONORS

With all this going on, the increased interest among the
students, the growing interest among our neighbors and sup-
porters in Charlotte and the surrounding territory, more weight

given the matter by the coaches and athletic policy directors, we’

are bound to have more interest among potential grapplers and
good high school material will pour into the school.

Then is when you start having good teams and
winning years and ninety per cent of the building-up
process is dispensed with as a result. A-few more good
wrestlers and a couple of good years and this dream
would be complete. It is very real and very possible to
become true.

MORE EMPHASIS ON MINOR SPORTS

The rise to importance of such sports as wrestling, tennis,
track, swimming, and even more to basketball would, it seems

to me, be a healthy situation for Davidson. Not exactly deem-|
phasis of the major sports, but just more emphasis on the minor

sports: in which a college of Davidson's size and calibre could
excel. Not that baseball is considered a minor sport (neither is
basketball, it is still minor around here and could use some
attention when it comes to rebuilding. More on baseball cam be
withheld for a few weeks.

Tt will be the last home match
for Charlie Parker's strong D. C.
wrestling squad when they. tangle
with the VPI grapplers in Johnston
Gym Saturday. The wrestling match
scheduled for the afternoon will be-
gin at 2. o'clock, but a Tea Dance
with Charlie Spivak supplying the
music will be held immediately fol-
lowing the match.

_ Plagued by constant injuries

the Wildcat strong-boys have

captured only one match this
season, but such veteran per-
formers as Captain Gene Cra-

Key, and Bill McNeely brigh-

ten the hopes for a Cat victory

Saturday afternoon: Coach

Parker has indicated that no

starting line-up could ‘be de-

termined until the week’s prac-
tice sessions were concluded,
but ‘the probable starters are as _
follows:

123 Ib. class, Key or Murray,

130 Ib. class, Gene Craven.
137 Ib. class, Ron. Reed.

_ 147 |b. class, Johnny Guiton.
157 Ib. class, Angus Andrews.
167 |b. class, John. Buxton.
177 |b. class, Bill McElveen.

Heavyweight, Bill McNeely.

The injured Cat regulars, Nabby
Armfield) and = Morley Vail, are
doubtful starters for the VPI match
and may be out of action for the
rest of the season due to chest in-
juries.

Undefeated Gene Craven, the
lad who had never wrestled be-
fore coming to Davidson in ‘49,
appears to be in top shape and
eager to add another defeated
opponent to his growing list.
Having lost only two matches
in his college career, Gene has
an excellent chance of becom.
ing the Southern Conference
champ in the 130-pound class.
He will be a definite threat in
the A.A.U. Tournament and the
Olympic wrestling tryouts,
both of which are to be held
at Davidson next month.

UNC—the first of the close night+
mares, DC looked good even in de-
feat (47% accuracy from the floor)
and a few bad breaks beat us, The
Heels are in the 9th position and
need a win over us badly to make
the play-offs. Smith Barrier,
Greensboro Daily News sports edi-~’

this week as saying, “We're out to
win 6 in a row.” There's nothing
we'd rather do than mess up their.

Wake Forest is a better team
‘in their own small gym, but
they were good enough up here.

This will be a hard one, but if

Dudley and Brooks can bottle

minor upset.

Duke and Maryland will definite-

so. It isn’t too crazy to hope for
a win over Maryland, though.

It all boils down to this: David-

WILDCAT OF THE WEEK - - - Jerry King

_ By BILL BRADFORD

Our Wildcat of the Week needs
no introduction to the reader even
though he is a relative newcomer
to Davidson. Jerry King hails from
Hamilton, Ohio, where basketball is
the sport. Coach Baird, who is from
the same part of the country
spotted him on one of his northern
trips and was very instrumental
in bringing him to Davidson.

In his high school, Jerry was one
of the outstanding boys in. the
State and his ability was recognized
by numerous awards; He was on the
third team all-state and got honora-
ble mention in, the All-American
selections. His team, largely
through his efforts, got into the
finals of the Ohio State Basketball
Tournament,

It did not take Coach Baird long
to recognize his potentialities on
the hardwood after his arrival at

Davidson and he was quickly ele-
vated to the ranks of the varsity,
But Jerry was not going to be just
another member of the varsity and
in short order was slated for a
Starting position at guard. Living
‘up to all previous expectations, he
has been consistently among the
‘chief *point-getters and to . date
boasts a healthy 9.3 average.

' Even though the Wildcats are
not faring too well on the tough
road of the Southern Conference,
the readers might find some conso-

Piation in the fact that Jerry is only

a Freshman and will be with us
for another three years. With seven

games still on tap, among which

‘are Duke and Carolina, his ability -
and accurate eye will do much
‘toward bettering our standing im
these games and those of the com-

‘ing year. e
