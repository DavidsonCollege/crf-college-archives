Three important Davidson
officials have been switched

to new positions in a drama- -

tic shake-up.

Mean of Students Richard
C. Burts Jr. will succeed
present registrar Jay Ost-
walt as Registrar, effective
January 1. Ostwalt will be-

come the Director of In-.

Structional Development, a
newly créated’ post.

Burts' position as dean >

will be assumed by William
H. Terry, who is presently
the minister of the David-
son College (Presbyterian
Church.

In looking at his future
position Burts: stated, ‘'I

will have a lot of learning.

to do as registrar. [ am not
going into my new job with
any startling platform. What
I hope to do is to continué’
the good work presently be-
ing done there.”

When asked to explain his
concept of the office of
Dean of Students, Terry
stated, ‘‘There has occured
in the last few years a de-
mise of the office of Dean
of Students in the area of
discipline of the individual.

‘Energy’

Energy is the key charac-
teristic sought in the student
who is chosen: by the N. C.
Fellows Program, according
to John D. Kelton, profes-
sor of psychology and David-
son director of the program.

The N.C. Fellows Pro-
gram, which has groups at
Davidson, North — Carolina
State, East Carolina, Wake
Forest and North Carolina
A & T, is designed to seek
out potential leaders and to
provide them with opportu-
nities for self-development.

The program selects__its
participants through ‘a series
of interviews, first on the
Davidson’ campus by ap-
pointment and then during
a weekend at the Presby-
terian center Montreat by in-
vitation.

Un the latter series of in-
terviews jeaders from the
outside take part in the in-
terviews.

Considerable criticism has
been levelled at the pro-
gram, and especially at its
selection procedures.

“The problem is, who is
going to get in?” said junior
(Mark (Meza, one of the Fel-
lows, “‘and they have high-
ly fallacious criteria for an-
swering this.

“They selected the origi-
nal fellows (in 1967) with
some kind of idea of dyna-
mic, ‘Kennedyesque . indivi-
duals who are going to lead
people,”” he continued. —

“It’s fair to say that the
judgment makers have been

that kind of people; and have =

looked for boys who~- would
develop leadership in social
problems, government, edu-
catin and business,’’ Kelton

“It has evolved into a sys-
tem of courts of faculty and
Students responsible for this
area. This, in my~ judg-
ment, frees me to shape the
office so that it can be of
help to students in all areas
of their life at Davidson.”

‘Both Burts’ and Terry saw
important changes in the
contemporary Davidson stu-
dent. Burts saw an_indivi-
duality in students that has
only begun to emerge in re-
cent years.

“There is little that holds
students together today.
Where: the administration
has lost influence, students
have gained it,’’ he said.

““But it appears to me
that tthe student body has
taken the freedoms, but not
the responsibilities. Every-
tbody’s business. has become
nobody's business.”

To illustrate his point,
Burts pointed to the: Code of
Responsibility of which he
said he was “apprehensive.”
He did not feel that students
were enforcing it.

Using drinking as an ex-
ample, he said that the Code
permits drinking, but not
drunkenness. What appalled
him was the fact that since
the Code has been in opera-
tion (October 1968) there
has been no one charged

said.

He stressed however that
the prog'am and its selec-
tion methods were not meant
to. exclude creative people
in areas, such as the arts.

Meza pointed out ithat the
program didnot include any
artists.

‘TI think there’s some snob-

bery involved there,” he
said.

“The —_ program at — Ohio
University, on whiche. this

one was based, was inclined
toward all sorts of leader-
ship,’’ Kelton said, ‘*What
has happened here in ac-
cidental. Ohio had a girl
whose ambition was to write
a novel. The point was not
what she wanted to do, but
how she communicated it.’

Meza described the lack of
artistically oriented people
in the program. as partially
due to the nature of the
‘Montreat weekend.

“The main characteristic
is that the interviews there
are highly intense, highly
emotional,’’ he said. Mon-
treat. doesn’t really delve in-
to the individual; the inter-
view challenges on emotion-
al and intellectual levels. I

Terry, who. will inherit
this situation when he takes
his new post said, ‘The con-
temporary students’ attitudes
and governance procedures
make it impossible for a
dean to act as they have
historically.

“This may be a difficult
adjustment for a lot of peo-

ple, even in the student
body, since the office of
dean has always carried

with it has cioud of punish-
ment.

“Tt is my impression that
Student ‘life .should develop
along positive lines rather
than ‘the formerly negative
ones where student life was
governed by so many ‘no-
nos.’ "'

Davidson's politician-in-re-

ran for it last fall, when it

vilty.”"

Senior ‘Gary Cash, who is
the student head of the pro-
gram, agreed that there was
a good deal of pressure) in
the selection process. \

“The intitial process Se-
lected people able: to re-
spond to pressure  ques-
tions,"’ he said. ‘‘Someone

was a decisive type of per-
son. A more sensitive -per-
son might not be able to put
tip —-with—this questioning.”

“I don't see the fellows
bringing back something to
the campus. Other’ than
helping a few individuals
lucky enough to get in, the
program doesn't give any-
thing to the campus," said
Meza.

However, Kelton denied
that this was the case, men-
tioning that Fellows have
set -up. open colloquia on
campus for interested  stu-
dents: in many fields,
brought visitors to the cam-
pus and been involved in
helping some _ non-Fellows
get summer placement.

Selection for the Fellows

will begin. next week with

their offices in Lingle Ma-:

such issues as pollution, In
1967 he founded the Council
of Governments, an organi-
zation of representatives
from several nearby county
governments, the original
aim of which was to facili-
tate widespread measures
against pollution.

(Martin denies that na-
tional politics is his main
ambition. He started in po-
liti¢s as County Commission-
er, which, he said, is a ‘‘poor
starting place’ for national
or statewide ambitions. He
