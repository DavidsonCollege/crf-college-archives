Little Library Installs Computer Catalog Sy

By David Smyth

Students returning to
Davidson this week, should
they see fit to visit the E.H.
Little library, will be greeted
by a new computerized cata-
logueing system, known to its
more intimate friendsas CHAL.

CHAL is an acronym for
“computerized help at Little,”
which serves doubly asan honor
to Archivist Dr. Chalmers
Davidson ’28.

The automation librarian,
Sharron Byrd, says that users

Condoms

Continued from page 1
ard Terry received a letter from
a group of “concerned students”
which suggested that the
school’s preferred prophylac-
tic was not dependable.

“This is not a case of a
single condom having broken,”
says the letter, “they break so

_ often they’ ve become a joke on
campus. We know this isn’t
your fault, but we thought you
might like to know.”

The students sent six con-
doms from the batch sent to
Davidson back to the manufac-
turer, Barnetts, Inc. of Char-
lotic, for testing. Along with
the condoms, the students en-
closed a letter requesting that
the sales manager for Barnetts,
Robert Buza, contact the school
as soon as the testing had been
completed.

In a lettér to Terry dated
May 24, 1991, Buza noted that
the condoms were subjected to
tests “in accordance with
ASTM D-3492, Section 7, test
procedure.” The test detects
“any leakage or weakness in
the tensile strength of the prod-
uct.”

Buza suggested that the re-
ported problems with the con-
doms were of an isolated na-
ture, and may have resulted
from consumer misuse of the
condoms.

Assistant Dean of Students
Leslie Marsicano, who orders
the condoms for the college,

added in a letter to The .

Davidsonian . that Davidson
distributes the same type of con-
_dom circulated by both Planned
Parenthood and the Meck-
lenburg Health department.

“brought too much stuff,”
Amanda Lesesne of Atlanta,
Ga. summed up her biggest fear
about coming to Davidson ina
word: “Classes,” she said. Not
everyone has these odd anxi-
etiesaboutcollege. When asked
what her biggest fear about
Davidson was, Rebecca
Billingsly of Colorado Springs,
COsaid“‘Idon’thaveany more.

__ Want to party a lot.”

Government documents will be
broughtinto the CHAL family next
spring, so some card catalogues
still remain for those volumes and
as a monument to our decadent
past. Eight of the Wilson Indexes,
including the Art Index and the
Reader’s Guide to Periodical Lit-
erature, will soon be added to the

stem

system. These collections have
rather large databases and p -
mers have not yet had time to add
them tothe computers, Byrd noted,

Two IBM and two Macintosh .
p.c.’s will also be installed to allow
for quick transferral of biblio-
graphical information from the
Indexes to personal disks.

The check out procedure will
remain the same, as bar codes must
be stuck to every volume before a '
more efficient system can be in-
stalled. 7
