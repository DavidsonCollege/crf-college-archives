Sorry, No Well

Last week we, the members
of the Rude, Notes Society,
brought you a somewhat devel-

Charlotte Observer sports sec-
tion! We can’t believe it! Hon-
estly, this could be the stupidest

oped argument that looked like sport in the world. We simply

talking about Braves’ baseball.)
Fertilizer: Why does the i
Physical Plant decide each year
to use a fertilizer which smells
like the entire city of Charlotte
has collectively farted atthesame
time and Davidson happens to
be down wind. Plus, the whole
idea of walking on “composted
turkey litter” makes us sick.

Homecoming: Folks, this
past weekend, most of us got
dressed up and went to dinner at
an expensive restaurant... To.
those of you who paid, I hope
you either had your date buy the
liquor or you got some play, oth-
erwise, you got screwed.

we Cannot support such a suggestive sexist statement.

Moving on to Saturday night on Patterson Court, the saga continues.
During Air Band at Phi Delta Theta, one act danced to a Red Hot
Chilipeppers song with only socks covering their genitalia. At the
climax of the song, an inflatable doll was thrown to the floor. The others
lowered one guy up and down over the doll to the beat of the music (we
will not even say what the lyrics were). The crowd cheered them on. At
one point someone from the audience grabbed the doll’s head and made
her body thrash. It was eerily evocative of a gang-rape scene.

This gesture lacks respect for women’s feelings about rape and
attack. How did you know there were not women in the audience who
had been through a similar experience? Such a scene makes a mockery
of the horror of rape. Thisis not “good, clean fun” - itis fun at the expense
of others. Perhaps in the future, aco-ed committee should screen the acts
before the damage is done.

Trivializing the issue by saying we’ve gone overboard does not
change the facts. Men and women on this campus will never be able to
communicate until they learn to respect one another. The only thing that
will stop such actions and flyers is our refusal to participate. We applaud
the women of Rusk. If a flyer offends you, do not go to the party - male
or female. If something that occurs during a party offends you, leave -
male or female. Only together can we make the Court activities fun and
safe for everyone.

Senior Senators Apologize:
In the most recent edition of Senior Scribbles, we
forgot to mention the outstanding work of Timisha
Bames in Kiss Me Kate. We apologize to Ms.
Bares for our error.

First of all, this poor sportsmanship feflects on the College. We
sound like a bunch of uneducated rednecks at the Charlotte Tractor Pull.
Secondly, and mostimportantly, itis inconsiderate to subject other spec-
tators in the community to x-rated ball games. ‘It would be a shame if a
professor felt uncomfortable taking his or her children to sports events
oncampus. The ball games are for every one in the community to enjoy,
not just the students.

I realize that hollering and booing are part of the fun of cheering on
ateam. But let’s be tasteful about it and watch our word choice.

Sincerely,
Catherine Mullins ‘92

Continued from page 4

Finally, and most truthfully,
their attitude toward their health
and their sexuality which they have
now shared with the whole cam-
pus and possibly their parents,
should keep any intelligent sexu-
ally active female miles away from
them.
