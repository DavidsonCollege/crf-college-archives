A home for internationalism

Great strides have been made
over the past several years to make
Davidson College a place where
international education and global:
awareness is not only encouraged,
but also highly accessible. Each
student, faculty, staff, and member
from the surrounding community
has ample opportunity to learn
about our world in any capacity.

The work of many adminis-
trators, faculty members, and stu-
dents is why internationalism came
to Davidson and now, to applaud
these efforts and to solidify this
concept, we must create a central-
ized location that encompasses the
many opportunities we have.

An International House at
Davidson would be such a place.
There, American students, inter-
national students, American fac-
ulty, international faculty, and staff
can congregate for a global escape
from the Davidson world from
which many rarely stray.

The proposals, one from the
Dean Rusk Program and a similar
one from the ISA, suggest that this
house be home to office space for

‘will be rooms for AT’s, in-

both the Dean Rusk Program, its
Student Advisory Council, and the
ISA. In addition, there would be
rooms for speakers, slide shows by
students, other Dean Rusk pro-
gramming, and meeting spaces for

rate international students from
mainstream Davidson like many
suggest.

First, the house would become
mainstream, and second, because
this house would draw a signifi-

need both an International House
and an international section of the

There is a kitchen for cook-

and a back porch for relax-

space, and from those who
feel the pressure to give
space.

Some argue that the loca-
tion of the house (behind
the new Davidson library)
is far removed and not ad-
equate. To that, I agree
that it is not central to
Davidson College and that

magazines, newspapers, and more.
Returning JYA students might use
the house for reunions and the thirty
students who concentrate in Inter-
national Studies can use the house
much like the Carolina Inn is used
for Center majors.

We need this house. Why?

An International House would
bring together many groups of
people who might otherwise stay
separate. It would not further sepa-

What’s
up?

Greetings: so useful yet so
stale. The usual greetings do fill
uncomfortable space, but they just
don’t allow a range of reply alter-
natives. What can we do to en-
courage a more lively exchange?
Let’s explore our salutation op-
tions.

A short “hi” does the job when
addressing a nameless person in
the Union but is a bit brusque for
friendly encounters. “Hey” does
better, but it can be deadly; used
alone, it leaves too much dead
space.

A prime example of this is the
experience of passing someone
you know vaguely on the way to
the post office —a short “hey” will
do for an anonymous student but
not for an acquaintance. Simply,
in such situations, monosyllabic
greetings must be used in conjunc-
tion with a variation on “what’s
up” or “how are you.”

Yet, these phrases are so bor-
ing and overused. There is'no
room for originality at all. Letitia
Campbell agrees that the alterna-
tives are few. In particular, she
does not like the usual responses to

the inane but popular “what’s up.”

Although “not much” is the stan-
dard comeback, it rarely matches
the truth. “Nothing” remains a
close second but approaches obvi-
ous lie status — especially here at
Davidson. So, what to say?
Well, Letitia and you count-

less others who undoubtedly pon-
der this subject for hours on end,
let’s see. “The sky” expired in
middle school. Anythingelse, such
as “too much, ” is a little odd for the
random fly by. The occasional
“you, baby” leaves recipients quite
uncomfortable and should be
avoided as a general rule.

What about “how are you?”
The replies to this query pretty
much run the gamut, right? Well,
it’s a little more complicated than
that, folks.

As Brett Perry and Fred .

Campagne pointed out to me, “How
are you?” opens up Pandora’s box
o’ complaints. Especially in the
library, the innocent “how” ques-
tion is sent back with a detailed list
of papers and tests. (Great, that’s
just why Lasked “how are you?” —
so I could hear about all the stuff
you have to do when, of course, I
have absolutely no work ever, and
my classes are so easy I’m think-
ing about adding another one. Tell
me more.) :

That’s enough to make a “hi”
and a smile look pretty amazing.

PS. On a’completely different

subject, I just had to mention the ~

one line of a conversation I over-
heard outside the library the other
night: “Last year I was sober and I
was not a happy camper I can tell
you.” I’m not even going to touch
that one.

This house would not.

cant amount of American students.
It can only bring together people
rather than separate them. Our
current system, where events and
offices are scattered, caters to sepa-
ration. This house-would not.
Some believe that our new
college union, which is still years
in the making, would offer the same
benefits as this house. That is fine.
If the past five years of increasing
international awareness at

pus would be advanta-
geous. But we can only answer
that by moving into the house at its
present location, which is appro-
priate for the goals outlined. We
must do that now. Then the ideas
of moving closer to campus have
greater reason to be entertained.
It would be a timely error to
kill this idea because of arguments
that will better be answered when
the house is international.
This house will not just be-

come another administrative sec-
tor. A house like this must provide
for students first; student use is
what will make the house a worth-
while project. Also, it would be a
grave mistake for an international
house not to recognize the needs of
international students and others
with global perspectives who
sometimes feel uncomfortable at
Davidson. And it would not.

Lastly, Davidson needs an of-
ficially recognized international
house in order to give it one more
argument, perhaps the most sub-
stantive, to combat the misconcep-
tion that Davidson has only a re-
gional sphere of interest.

An International House will
benefit ourselves, our peers, and
the surrounding community and it
will strengthen the already strong
pledge that Davidson gives towards
international education. For these
ends and those listed above, I be-
lieve it is vital that this college
administration respond to the vast
support voiced and make the con-
cept of an International House a
reality.

Reflections from
Parent’s Weekend

As a parent of both a senior
male and afreshmen female, I noted
with interest the panel of seven
men speaking at Parent’s Week-
end. Clearly, there were no women
provided to speak, although one
had been listed in the program.
Coupled with the failure to an-
nounce the women’s home soccer
game on Friday, the male domi-
nated presentation to the parents
raises some concerns as to the
message sent to female students
and faculty at Davidson.

Also, I wonder how this same
all-male panel reflects the tone re-
garding Patterson Court and the
social arena across Davidson Col-
lege. A lack of sensitivity to the
social development of students at
Davidson strikes one when listen-

ing to the administrators.

Where are the co-ed activities
that provide natural and persistent
places for women and men to be-
come friends? Too few and far
between, I think. Isn’t it time to
stop trying to prove Davidson Col-
lege is top string and time to put
more energy into making students’
four years here healthy, academi-
cally rich, and morally and so-
cially enhancing?

On a.separate note, I would
like to know for what the differ-
ence between tuition costs and the
estimated cost of educating a stu-
dent here (around $5,000 accord-
ing to figures quoted to us) is spent
on.

For a parent with two students
here paying full tuition the differ-

ence seems, to me, excessive and
unfair, especially in light of my
recent observation regarding ‘stu-
dent life and gender equality is-
sues. :

Don’t get me wrong, I love
Davidson. I think it is a wonderful
college, and I make these notes not
as an indictment but as a proposed

" direction to pursue. I certainly do

not mean to highlight only the nega-
tive issues of a campus that offers
a superb liberal arts. education and
asafe, pastoral environment to stu-
dents. But for an institution with
such high ambitions, I think it is
important to remember the com-
mitment to students, a commit-
ment that should run paramount in
all administration and faculty
minds.
