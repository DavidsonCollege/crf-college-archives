Among The Greeks

PI KAPPA PHI

Speaking of the dance, several of
the Pi Kapps seem to have had a
really bang-up time at the Nurses
Danee last Saturday night in Char-
lotte. Bob Wheless comes back with
tales that makes us wonder what
we're in for when injuries call us
to a Charlotte Hospital. Bill, the
Snow-Sargent seems to be infatuat-
ed with Katherine whom he met
o er there. How about that Pit?

Mitchell Patton seems to stay tied
vp with Marrion Wolff, who is at
Win hrop. 1 believe that Mike
would like to be marryin’ Wolff,
but as for the other half, she says
“... no!” When Mitchell asked
for a picture of her, she obligingly
sent a camera,

the annual football game he-
tween the brothers and pledges
ended in the usual fashion. The bro-
thers easily defeated the pledges,
the score heing 6-0. All the pledges
played well, but were no match for
the brothers with their agile per-
furmer Claudeball Higginbotham.
Claudeball wa: awarded with a
trophy that will really support him
in his old age.

only one little caich, she is‘engaged.

An unnamed brother gave Col-

Sam a start the other day with his
selections from Spike Jones and
scrutinizing comments, that were
broadcast. frorh his Duke dorm

“You just wait ‘till basketball
season.” That’s the battle cry of our
football team which has converted
to gym shoes and shorts. Jim Mill-
er, Pat Clark and Marshall Taylor
and the rest of the boys ought to
shoot a very good record this year.

Joe Parker made the best grades
among the freshmen again this re-
port with Herman Mauney a close
second. Bub Kester is one of the
top men in grades in the whole fra-
ternity, having made one A, three
B pluses and a B. Imagine that!

Humphries, Coffin and Plaster
were entertained very fraternally
by Frank Furman down Jackson-
ville way when the band went
South. Coffin especially had a fine
time, Marshall and Lefty’got down
to Jacksonville for a few hours dur-
ing the holidays. They went by a
local vacuum tube, which took them
on the way through ‘Nigeria, Bul-
garia and’ Hysteria.

J. G. Humphries, duc to persis-
tent pouting, has been moved from
third to first chair horn in le grand

We sure have been missing Mel-

vyn. The irony of his moving out
was that his bitterest foil, Joe
Brown, moved into his sack.

DR. TOM DAGGY

Dr. Tom Daggy, assistant pro-
fessor of biology was recently
awarded the J. J. Davis prize by
the Indiana Academy of Science.
The Davis award, which is made
annually, went to Dr. Daggy for
research and writing on the Tene-
brionidae. Dr. Daggy, @ graduate
of Eariham College and of North-
western University, has been 2
member of the Davidson staff
since 1947. The faculty and stu-

KAPPA SIGMA

Last Saturday night the annual
Black and White was held at> the
Morris Field Policeman’s Club. The
banquet began at 7:30 and was fol-
lowed by a dance which ‘lasted till
twelve.

Charlton Tortence was master of
ceremonies and with. the help of
Dactor Chalmers Davidson present
ed an excellent program. The mair
feature of the entertainment was .
song which had a sianza dedicate
to each of six outstanding Presi
dents of the College. The song fol
lowed a short talk by Dr, Davidso.
in which he gave a character skete!
of each president. ‘The music for
the song which was presented by ;
sextet was written by Dr. Pfohl
and the words were furnished by
Dr: Davidson.

The dance after the banquet was
one of the best that we have had.
“Moose” found a good band when
he got Walter Hagen — they didn’t
know what Be Rop was.

The dance would have been a to
better if Eric and Bill White hadn't
left so soon. They weren't stag.

“Fars” wouldn't let him.

Chapel Prayer

Due to the many requests we
have had to print the prayer ren-
dered in Chapel last week by Bilt
Alexander, the “DAVIDSONIAN"”
has obtained it; and a copy ap-
pears below.

Our Gracious and Loving Father:

Thou who dost move in orderly
fashion the immense reaches of the
universe, yet whose cye is on the
little sparrow which drops to the
ground and whose heart. is sensi-
tive to the suffering and fortune
of thy children, hear our prayer as
we raise it to thee,

Make us responsively conscious
that You are concerned with our
little lives, that you really care
whether we do right or wrong.

Give us a profound sense of the
reality and concreteness of our sin.

{Sharpen the blunted nerves of our

consciences that we may recognize
evil by habit and careless living.
Deliver us from the guilt of gen-
eralizing. Forbid that we should ask
forgiveness of “our many sins”
when we mean that intolerant bi-

goted attitude toward a_ colored.

man or that sense of pride which
prevented our forgiving a student
who abused us. Help us to search
our hearts faithfully for what we
have done wrong, and not to lazily
pass it off by repeating some glib
phrase in chapel. Save us from the
hipocrisy of holding a hymn-book
in our hand and thoughtlessly and
perfunctorily ritualizing the words.

Help us to feel deeply the great
experiences and abiding symbolism
of our religion. And never let us
forget our Great Friend who op-
posed all hypocrisy and shallow re-
ligion with his whole soul, and who
went to a cross that our religion
would be founded not on generali-
ties but on one particular time in
histéry when God rent the curtain
of eternal. silence.

In the name of him who was
flesh and blood and not generality,
we pray. Amen.

Go to the Library
And See World

The Davidson College Library
has recently acquired two new
globed maps. One
prololical globe and the other is a
celestrial globe. Both are products
of the famous maps and globe mak-
ers, George F. Cram, Incorporated,
of Indianapolis, Indiana.

The world globe is as near up
to date as possible. It is correct for
the period immediately following
the second World War.

The map of the heavenly bodies
is not intended to be complete as
such. All visible stars and planets
are not on it, but most of the ma-
jor constellations and story of the
first magnitude are included. The

one can easily see by adjusting the

forty-first annual session, Noven-

Dean Bailey appeared as a non-

the Conference because of his posi-
tion as Dean of Students, all Deans
as well as Presidents of the various

is composed of alumni of the fifty-
seven fraternities within the Con-

A proposal by the Conference to
abolish all’ rules by national fra-

race, creed, or color, thereby leav-

In reference to.the matter of fra-

Scholarship Counselor of the Con-

at a rapid pace. Fraternity scholar
ship as such has practically disap-
peared from the halls of learning. .

we can save ourselves... With the

Davidson was one of the institu-
tions which exhibited interest i
fraternity discussion programs on
the eampus, wjth sponsorship
through the Dean's office and the

ably take the form of organized
bull sessions on topics of general

interest to the members of the va-

Clyde S. Johnson, chairman of the
