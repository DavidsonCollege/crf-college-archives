er and personality, Dr. Lacy is expect-
ed to draw a large crowd at all of the
services. Special musical programs
will be a part of the evening services.

“Dr. Lacy is a man with a present
and a future as well as a past, so it is
to be hoped that the students will re-
spond enthusiastically to the spirit of
this series of services, and that they
will keep the dates of the meetings in
mind.”

tackle from the seven-yard line for
the score.

Mackorell, Wingfield, and Hutchins
played brilliantly in the Cat backfield,
while Morgan, Rives, McElrath and
Windham looked good in the line. Yar-
borough, a sophomore back who
played his first varsity football Satur-
day, was also outstanding.

The the Citadel, Baker and Quarter-
man supplied most of the power. Quar-
terman measured up to all advance

punts of over 60 yards during the

DAVIDSON VARSITY TO
TACKLE W. & M. INDIANS

(Continued from page 5)

The Indians, who use almost the
same type of play as that of Citadel,
will have a weight advantage over the
‘Cats of ten pounds to the man. More-
over, the Virginians will be playing
before a home-coming crowd, a fact
which should considerably increase the
spirit of the team,

other hand, William and ‘Mary beat
V. M._L, 14-0,. making them. eight
points better than the Wildcats. How-
ever, the Indians seem to be a bit
erratic, and have not shown much
stuff against the class of competition
that Davidson has. They dropped
contests to the only real teams they
played, namely, Navy and Washington
and Lee, The ‘Cats’ defeats came as
hard-fought victories for the South’s
greatest team, Duke, and North Caro-
lina. It’s any man’s game on the pen-
cil and paper method, but we'll take
the Wildcats.

TIGERS LOSE TO TERRIERS

Carolina eleven, led by the elusive
Earl Clary, the “Gaffney Ghost,”
bowled over N. C. State, 14-0, to finish
their Southern Conference schedule
with a clean slate, no defeats, or ties

marring their record.

William and Mary and Emory and
Henry met in a night game, and the
Indians met defeat at the hands of the
home town boys, to the tune of 26-6
