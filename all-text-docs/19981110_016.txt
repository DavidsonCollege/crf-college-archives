Wildcats prepare for opener against top-ranked Duke

By Tripp CHERRY
Staff Writer

One week from today the Davidson
Wildcats will open their season against
the country’s number one ranked team
_ in the Charlotte Coli-
seum ina game that will
be nationally televised
on espn2.

After facing the
Duke Blue Devils in
front of the famous
Cameron Crazies for the
past two years, the
Wildcats will appreci-
ate the less intimidating
and more spacious
Charlotte Coliseum.

most definitely be a

After barely missing the Final Four
last year, Duke returns all their key
players with the exception of intense
floor leader Steve Wojciechowski.

Facing a ot Sega Duke team
should _ be
nothing new
for this year’s
group of Wild-
cats. Allofthe

ers have faced
Duke for the
past two sea-
sons, and they
hope to use
that experi-
ence to their
advantage this
year.

because they won’t have their student
section,” said assistant coach Jason
Zimmerman. “But we’re still going to
be facing the’ same team that we would

play in this type of game.”

Last year with 13:11 to go in the
game, a Stephen Marshall tip-in cut the
Duke lead to eight points. From there

the Blue Devils went on a 43-16 run to
end the game. The final score was 100-
65. :
Two years ago the Wildcats trailed
the Blue Devils by just seven points at
halftime before falling 85-58.

‘Obviously the focus this year is
going to be hanging with the deep and
athletic bunch from Durham for forty
minutes.

“We have to execute for a full
forty minute game,” said Zimmerman.

A large part of the let down the
past two years against Duke has been
turnovers late in the game when the
Blue Devils utilized their full court pres-
sure defense. Last year, the Wildcats
committed 32 turnovers that led to 48
Duke points.

After spending much of the past
six weeks on crutches, point guard Ali
Ton looked impressive on Thursday
night in his first action since his broken
foot dishing out 10 assists with only two
turnovers. For the Wildcats to be close
at the end of the game, Ton and the rest
of the Wildcats will have to take care of
the ball.

The Wildcats will also have to
worry about Elton Brand in the paint. In
two exhibition games, which the Blue
Devils won by anaverage of 47.5 points,

On the November 17’th Davidson-Duke match-up in the Charlotte

“T hope we continue this series. The last two years we’ ve gotten to the eight
minute mark in the second half against Duke in great shape. Then something
always seems to happen to us, and we fall apart. I’m hoping that our guys this
year, with all their experience, will come up large. I believe that if we are
within striking distance with eight minutes left, arid I think we will be, that
we can finish, that we have a legitimate shot at whipping Duke.”

A glance at the Pundits’ take on Davidson hoops

The Sporting News: “The Wildcats
appear considerably stronger than they
werea year ago, especially if new starter
Davor Halbauer fulfills his potential as
a slasher and scorer. Davidson should
again win 20, run away with the North-
ern Division title and outrun Charleston
for the league championship.”

Street & Smith’s: “McKillop returns
after pushing his ‘Cats to an SC tourna-
ment championship, a 20-10 overall
mark, and an NCAA tournament ap-

pearance. Davidson has a chance to do
it all again.”

Lindy’s: “Four stratérs return along
with four other veterans, giving the
Wildcats another formidable team.”

Preview Sports: “Not since Lefty
Driesell and Terry Holland coached at
Davidson in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s
have the Wildcats enjoyed the kind of
success that coach Bob McKillop’s
clubs have experienced over the past

three seasons.”

“There is no reason to doubt that
McKillop will guide Davidson to a

fourth straight division championship :

this season and contend for a second
consecutive conference crown and
NCAA Tournament berth.”

Basketball News: “It will only get
easier for Davidson after it faces Duke
in its nationally televised opener.”

Dick Vitale’s: “If there’s heen a domi-
nant team in the Southern Conference
in the ‘90s, it’s been the Wildcats...”

“Yet, until last March, few no-
ticed. Last year’s trip to the Tourna-
ment should have changed all of that.
And, if it didn’t, perhaps another trip-
this time accompanied with a victory -
will.”
