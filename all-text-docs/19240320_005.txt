The story is built around the mystery of
the murder of a notorious clubman and it
holds spectators breathless with suspense,

As a member of the Long Island society
colony Miss Dana enacts the role of a young
girl who faces disgrace to protect her mar-
ried sister. The role calls for a number of
highly dramatic and emotional scenes, in
each of which the charming little star ac-
quits herself superbly. “The Social Code” is
another genuine triumph for Miss Dana and
will be hailed with delight by her many ad-
mirers.

outlined plans for the spring that eclipse any

previous effort of the organization.

Arrangements have been made to bring the
club before the student body during Junior
Speaking in three one-act plays. The first
of these given by the Seniors of the club
will be The Ghost Story, one of Booth Tark-
ington’s best known works. The Sophomores

"The Dramatic Club, in a spring study
course, will follow a plan devised by Pres-
ident Ted Jones. This course is to consist
of two series of lectures and classes: the one,
Stage Make-up, conducted by Prot. B.-L.
Dendy, to be undertaken first; the other,
“Stage Direction and Management.” by Prof.
EK. J. Erwin, to follow in the period between
Junior Speaking and Commencement.

In Mr. Dendy’s classes in make-up the de-
tailed study of the building of various types
and characters will be considered. In addi-
tion, practical experience will be obtained as
it is planned to have the students practice on
one another. The material for this has ar-

JUNIOR WEEK
(Continued from page 1)
Glee Club will render much and
harmony.

Saturday is full day—every moment |
packed full of fun. In the morning will
come the Inter-class Track Meet. The aft-
will filled with the Promenade,
Out-door_Festival_and the annual reception.

Saturday night—!! This much can be
said though: one will be transported (in
transports of joy, of course) back to ancient |
Roman times. What one will hear, see and
feel will give him new conception of
Roman life in the days when Nero and
Cicero and all those other togo-toters ran
around loose. |

It has not yet been decided who will be |
the speaker at the “Y” Sunday evening, but |
every effort is being made to secure a fine |
one,
Monday is uneventful except that at night |
there will -be movies—and so forth. |

All in all, this Junior Speaking promises !
to be a record-breaker in every way. The |
committee in charge expending every |
ounce of their collective energies to make |
it a stellar success, and the Junior class, to |
a man, is backing them in their efforts. But, |
as has often been. observed, the measure of !
the success of a Speaking occasion lies in|
the number of girls on the Hill. So get busy '
and ask that girl; she’s the necessary in-
gredient for a big time. |
